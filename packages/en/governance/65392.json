L. P.\r\n\r\nJ. T. W. G.\r\n\r\nAND\r\n\r\nJ. E. G. H.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of this work is to trace the growth of the Roman constitution,\r\nand to explain its working during the two phases of its maturity, the\r\ndeveloped Republic and the Principate. The title selected perhaps\r\nexpresses more succinctly than any other could do the nature of the plan\r\nwhich I wished to undertake. My desire was to touch, however briefly,\r\non all the important aspects of public life, central, municipal, and\r\nprovincial; and, thus, to exhibit the political genius of the Roman\r\nin connexion with all the chief problems of administration which\r\nit attempted to solve. This design, like many other comprehensive\r\nplans which have to be adapted to the limits of a single volume, was\r\nnecessarily subjected to modifications in detail; and, since one of these\r\nmodifications has affected the whole scope of the book, it requires some\r\nmention in a preface.\r\n\r\nI had intended to carry the treatment of my subject beyond the confines\r\nof the Principate, and to describe the political organisation of the\r\nlater Empire as elaborated by Diocletian and his successors. I found,\r\nhowever, that a discussion of this period would cause my work to exceed\r\nthe reasonable limits which can be conceded to a handbook, and I was\r\nforced to abandon the enterprise much against my will. I was somewhat\r\ncomforted in this surrender by the suggestion that the constitution of\r\nthe later Empire was perhaps not strictly “Roman.” This is a verdict with\r\nwhich I agree in part. The organisation which had Constantinople as its\r\ncentre was certainly the organisation of an Empire which was permeated\r\nwith the social ideals of later Rome, which had adopted a Latin code,\r\nand which employed an administrative system whose origin was to be found\r\nin Italy; but in the forms of rule which the monarchy presented the\r\nbreak with the past was remarkable. The absolutism was no new thing, but\r\nthe guise assumed by this absolutism was startlingly novel. It is not\r\nonly that classic traditions were forgotten, that, as Gibbon says, “the\r\npurity of the Latin language was debased by adopting, in the intercourse\r\nof pride and flattery, a profusion of epithets, which Tully would\r\nhave scarcely understood, and which Augustus would have rejected with\r\nindignation,” but that, even where the continuity in public institutions\r\ncan be traced, it is one of names rather than of ideas. In the Principate\r\nwe see a perverted Republic; in the monarchy a _Res publica_ only in the\r\nnarrowest etymological sense of those words. Perhaps the accession of\r\nDiocletian does, after all, mark the close of a true “Roman” public life.\r\n\r\nThe task, even as thus limited, has been a long one, and would have been\r\nstill longer had it not been for the kindly assistance rendered me by a\r\nformer pupil, Miss Muriel Clay, of Lady Margaret Hall. The help which\r\nshe has given in the reading of the proofs, and in the verification of\r\nthe references to original authorities, has not only facilitated the\r\nproduction of the book, but has materially improved it by the removal\r\nof errors and obscurities. I have also to thank her for the Index of\r\nsubjects and the Index of Latin words which accompany the volume.\r\n\r\n                                                              A. H. J.

In the\r\ncentre of the district lay a stronghold (_arx_, _castellum_), in which\r\nthe people took shelter in time of danger.\r\n\r\nThere are, indeed, traditions of isolated units still smaller than the\r\n_pagus_. The clan is sometimes pictured as wandering alone with its crowd\r\nof dependants.[4] But migration itself would have tended to destroy\r\nthe self-existence of the family; the horde is wider than the clan,\r\nand the germ of the later _civitas_ must have appeared first, perhaps,\r\nin the _pagus_, later in the _populus_ which united many _pagi_. The\r\nunion may have been slight at first, and may often have been based\r\nmerely on the possession of some common shrine. Much of the civil and\r\ncriminal law was administered within the family in the form of a domestic\r\njurisdiction which survived in historical Rome; but a common market would\r\ninvolve disputes, and these would have to be settled by an appeal to an\r\narbitrator (_arbiter_) even before the idea of a magistracy was evolved.\r\nLastly come military necessities whether of defence or aggression. It\r\nis these that create a power which more than any other makes the state.\r\nThe mild kingship of the high-priest of the common cult gives way to the\r\norganised rule of an _imperium_, and the king, _praetor_ or _dictator_,\r\nis the result, the coherence of infant organisation being dependent on\r\nthe strength of the executive power.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest city of Rome, to which we are carried back by tradition\r\nor archaeological research, this development has already been attained.\r\nThe square city (_Roma quadrata_) was the enclosure of the Palatine,\r\nthe “grazing-land” of the early Roman shepherd;[5] the bounds of the\r\noldest _pomerium_ were known in later times to have been the limits\r\nof this site,[6] and traces of the tufa ring-wall may yet be seen.\r\nFrom this centre the city spread in irregular concentric circles.[7]\r\nTraces of ritual have preserved a memory of a city of the seven hills\r\n(_Septimontium_)—not those of the Servian Rome, but five smaller\r\nelevations, three (Palatium, Cermalus, Velia) on the older city of the\r\nPalatine, and two (Oppius, Cispius) on the newly-included Esquiline;\r\nwhile two valleys on the latter (Fagutal and Subura) also bear the name\r\n_montes_,[8] and are, with the sites that really deserve the name,\r\ninhabited by the _montani_, who are distinguished from the _pagani_,\r\nthe inhabitants of the lower-lying land beneath. It is not impossible\r\nthat these seven “hills” were once the sites of independent or loosely\r\nconnected villages (_vici_, or perhaps even _pagi_) which were gradually\r\namalgamated under a central power, and, as the walls of the state could\r\nnever have been coterminous with its territory, each successive enclosure\r\nmust show the incorporation, voluntary or enforced, of a far greater\r\nnumber of smaller political units than those which the fortifications\r\ndirectly absorbed. Modern inquirers, following up a further hint supplied\r\nby the survival of a ritual, have held that there was another advance\r\nbefore the epoch of the Servian Rome was reached, and that what is known\r\nas “the Rome of the four regions” survives in the sites associated with\r\nthe chapels of the Argei,[9] and is preserved in the administrative\r\nsubdivisions of the city to the close of the Republic.[10] To form these\r\nregions the Caelian, the Quirinal, and the Viminal hills were added,\r\nwhile the Capitol with its two peaks now became, not indeed a part of\r\nthe town, but, as the “head” of the state, its chief stronghold and the\r\nsite of its greatest temples. The final step in the city’s growth was the\r\nenclosure associated with the name of Servius Tullius, a fortification\r\nextending beyond the limits of the true _pomerium_, which added to the\r\ncity the whole of the Esquiline to the north-east, the Aventine to the\r\nsouth-west, stretched to the west to the bank of the Tiber where the Pons\r\nSublicius crosses the river, and formed the enceinte of Republican Rome.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that an amalgamation of slightly different ethnic elements\r\nmay be associated with this extension of the city. That a difference of\r\nrace lay at the basis of the division of the primitive people into their\r\nthree original tribes was believed in the ancient, and has often been\r\nheld in the modern world. The Tities (or Titienses) were supposed to be\r\nSabine,[11] the Ramnes (or Ramnenses) Roman; the Luceres were held by\r\nsome to be also Latin, by others to be Etruscan. There is, however, a\r\nrival tradition of the artificial creation of these tribes by the first\r\nRoman king,[12] and, when we remember the arbitrary application in the\r\nGreek world of tribe-names that had once been significant,[13] we may\r\nhold it possible that the great συνοικισμός typified by the name of\r\nRomulus was not accompanied by any large alien intermixture with the\r\nprimitive Latin population. The existence of Sabine gods like Sancus,\r\nor Sabine ritual as typified in Numa Pompilius, is no more evidence of\r\nSabine intermixture than the early reception of Hellenic deities is of\r\nGreek;[14] and though it is possible that a Sabine tribe once settled\r\non the Quirinal, and it is almost certain that at the close of the\r\nmonarchical period an Etruscan dynasty ruled in Rome, yet the language,\r\nreligion, and political structure of the early state were of a genuinely\r\nLatin type. There was, indeed, contact with peoples more developed in\r\nmaterial civilisation or more gifted in their spiritual life, and to this\r\ncontact the debt of Rome was great. Rome adopts the Chalcidian alphabet;\r\nshe receives early Greek divinities such as Hercules, Castor, and Pollux;\r\nshe models her statue of Diana on the Aventine on that of Artemis at\r\nMassilia; she imitates the Greek tactical organisation in her early\r\nphalanx. But it is very doubtful whether the obligation extended to the\r\nreception of the political ideas of Hellas. Parallels between Roman and\r\nHellenic organisation may be observed in certain institutions such as the\r\n_equites_ and the _census_; but these are military rather than purely\r\npolitical, and in all the fundamental conceptions of public law—the\r\nrights of the citizens individually and collectively, the power of the\r\nmagistrate and the divine character even of secular rule—Rome differed\r\nwidely from the developed Greek communities with which she was brought\r\ninto contact, and seems in her political evolution to have worked out\r\nher own salvation. The more developed civilisation of Etruria doubtless\r\nfilled up certain gaps in her political and religious organisation both\r\nby contact and by rule. The strength of the religious guilds (_collegia_)\r\nof Rome may be due in part to an imitation of the Etruscan hierarchy; the\r\nrefinements of the science of augury may also be Tuscan; and tradition,\r\nas we shall see, derives from the same source the _insignia_ of the Roman\r\nking.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. _The Elements of the Population—Patricians, Plebeians, Clients_\r\n\r\nThe free population of Rome as a developed city-state was composed of\r\nthe two elements of Patricians and Plebeians. The ultimate source of\r\nthis distinction, which is undoubtedly anterior to the foundation of\r\nthe city, can only be a matter of conjecture; but the origin of the\r\nPatriciate may probably be explained as the result partly of earlier\r\nsettlement, partly of superior military prowess. The warriors within the\r\npale receive the new settlers, but only on certain conditions; these\r\nconditions are perpetuated and become a permanent badge of inferiority.\r\nThe happiest guess of the many made by Roman antiquarians as to the\r\norigin of the Patricians was that they were originally the “free-born”\r\nmen (_ingenui_), the men who could point to fathers (_patres_) and in\r\ntheir turn become full heads of families[15]—the men in short who, at a\r\ntime when the family with its juristic head, and not the mere individual,\r\nwas the true unit of life, were the only full citizens of Rome. Such\r\nmen alone could be partners in the true ownership of property, or sue\r\nand be sued in their own right,[16] and such an exclusive right to a\r\nfull personality in private law they claimed in virtue of their public\r\nservices or privileges—the duty of taking the field on horseback or in\r\nheavy armour, the right of uplifting their voices in the assembly when\r\nthey acclaimed a king or ratified a law.\r\n\r\nThe whole free community, other than the _patres_ or Patricians, is\r\nregarded as the “complement” of the latter, “the multitude” (_plebs_,\r\n_plebeii_) which, with the fully privileged class, makes up the\r\nstate.[17] It is possible that, in a very primitive stage of Roman\r\nhistory, these Plebeians may all have been in the half-servile condition\r\nof clientship; but, even when the earliest records of Rome are revealed\r\nto us, this has ceased to be the case. Not only has the son of the\r\noriginal client evolved a freedom of his own, but a man may _become_ a\r\nplebeian member of Rome without subjecting himself to the degradation\r\nof _clientela_. No less than five ways are described or can be imagined\r\nin which the non-citizen could become a citizen, and at least one of\r\nthese reveals the possibility of the perfectly free Plebeian. In the\r\nold life of the _pagus_ and the _gens_, the weaker sought protection of\r\nthe stronger by a willing vassalage, which ripened, when the state was\r\nformed, into the Plebeiate which had its origin in clientship. A similar\r\nposition was ultimately gained by the descendant of the manumitted\r\nslave. The stranger (_hostis_) from a city which had no treaty relations\r\nwith Rome, or no relations which guaranteed a mutual interchange of\r\ncitizenship, must, if he wandered to this new home, also make application\r\nto a patron and become his client. It is less certain what was the fate\r\nof the inhabitants of a conquered city who were violently deported\r\nto Rome. The annalists, indeed, represent such men as being received\r\ninto the citizen body, and as becoming members of the tribe and the\r\n_curia_;[18] but it is probable that in the prehistoric period they\r\nbecame clients, immediately of the king to whom they had made their\r\nsubjection, ultimately perhaps of patrician houses to which he chose to\r\nattach them as dependants.[19] In all these cases clientship may have\r\nbeen the original lot of the Plebeian; but this could hardly have been\r\nthe fate of the immigrant who moved to Rome from a city which already\r\npossessed the _jus commercii_ with that state, and by the exercise of the\r\nright of voluntary exile from his native land (_jus exulandi_) claimed\r\nthe Roman _civitas_. The existence of such relations between Rome and\r\ncities of the Latin league is attested for a very early period, and they\r\nmay even have been extended to cities outside the league.[20] As the _jus\r\ncommercii_ implies the right of suing and being sued in one’s own person\r\nbefore Roman courts, there seems no reason why such an immigrant should\r\nmake application to a Roman patron;[21] but, if he did not, he was in\r\nthe chief aspects of private law a perfectly free man, and illustrated\r\na status to which the quondam-client must from an early period have\r\ntended to approximate. Where the right of intermarriage (_jus conubii_),\r\nas well as the right of trade, was guaranteed in a treaty between Rome\r\nand some other town, it is questionable whether this gift ever implied\r\nthe possibility of matrimonial union with members of the Patriciate. It\r\nis at least certain that, at the time of the Twelve Tables (451 B.C.),\r\nand therefore probably from a very early period, a disability common to\r\nall the Plebeians was that they might not intermarry with members of\r\npatrician clans. Yet, although there was this great gulf parting the\r\ntwo orders, it was possible for either class to be transferred to the\r\nstatus of the other. We shall see that tradition represents a vote of\r\nthe Patricians in their assembly as a means sufficient to recruit their\r\norder by the addition of a new family; while, after the Plebs had evolved\r\nan assembly of its own, a _transitio ad plebem_ might be effected by an\r\nact of that body.[22] Adoption from a patrician into a plebeian family\r\nproduced the same result.\r\n\r\nThat the clientship of which we have spoken was not peculiar to Rome,\r\nbut was an old established Italian institution, is a truth reflected\r\nin the legend of the _gens Claudia_ which moved from Regillum to Rome\r\nwith a vast multitude of dependants.[23] It is separated by but a thin\r\nline from slavery. While the latter was based on conquest in war, the\r\nformer was probably the result of voluntarily-sought protection in the\r\nturmoil of a migratory life, or perhaps at times the consequence of\r\nthe suzerainty of a powerful village being extended over its weaker\r\nneighbours. In the developed state the principal object of this relation\r\nis legal representation by the _patronus_, for the client possesses no\r\nlegal personality of his own. For the condition of the client we can but\r\nappeal to that of the slave and the son of the family. Such property as\r\nhe possessed may have been merely a _peculium_, the small accumulation\r\nof cattle and means of husbandry which his master allowed him to form;\r\nhad the client wronged a citizen, we may assume that his body might be\r\nsurrendered in reparation of the damage (_noxae deditio_); the origin of\r\nRoman occupation of land on sufferance (_precario_) may perhaps be traced\r\nto the permission by the patron to till a little plot of land which\r\nmight be resumed at will;[24] in default of direct heirs (_sui heredes_)\r\nsuch personal belongings as the client possessed may have fallen to the\r\nmembers of the protecting clan (_gentiles_), for it was to the clan\r\nrather than to the family that he was attached.\r\n\r\nThe description which we possess of the mutual obligations of patrons\r\nand clients,[25] although it contains many primitive elements, obviously\r\nrefers to a time when the client was allowed to possess property of his\r\nown and was often a man of considerable wealth, but when, in spite of\r\nthis power, he does not seem to have appeared in person in the public\r\ncourts. It was the duty of the Patricians to interpret the law to their\r\nclients, to accept their defence in suits, and to represent them when\r\nthey were plaintiffs.[26] The client, on the other hand, was bound to\r\nhelp to dower the daughter of the patron if the latter was poor; to pay\r\nthe ransom if he or his son were captured by enemies; and, if his lord\r\nwas worsted in a private action or incurred a public fine, to defray\r\nthe expense from his own property. If any of these duties were violated\r\nby the client, he was held guilty of treason (_perduellio_), and as the\r\nsecular arm suspended him from the unlucky tree, so the religious power\r\ndevoted to the infernal gods the patron who had woven a net of fraud\r\nfor his dependant.[27] Even after the effective infliction of religious\r\nsanctions had disappeared, the duty to the client ranked only second\r\nto that which was owed by a guardian to his ward.[28] The earliest\r\nclientship was strictly hereditary; but the bond must have become weaker\r\nwith successive generations, after the evolution of plebeian rights, and\r\nat a time when _clientes_ themselves possessed votes in the _comitia\r\ncuriata_.[29] Nay, the Plebeian at this period may himself be a patron,\r\nand his attainment of full citizenship in private law must have been\r\nheld to qualify him for this duty of protection. Yet the client body\r\nstill continues to be recruited by new members; for the antique form of\r\n_applicatio_ still exists, and the manumitted slave owes duties to his\r\npatron. We know too that in the fourth and third centuries the patronal\r\nrights over the freedman extended to the second generation.[30]\r\n\r\nA faint trace of hereditary clientship, based on a purely moral sanction,\r\nand accompanied perhaps by the performance of some of the duties of the\r\nold relationship, still exists in the second century. The family of\r\nMarius, we are told, had been clients of the plebeian Herennii, and some\r\nof the rights of the relationship were held to extend to him. But we are\r\nalso told that at this period a principle was recognised that this bond\r\nwas for ever broken by the client’s attainment of curule office,[31] that\r\nis, by the ennoblement of him and his family.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. _Roman Family Organisation—The Gens, the Familia, the Bondsman and\r\nthe Slave—The Disposition of Property—The Conception of “Caput”_\r\n\r\nThe clan (_gens_) was an aggregate of individuals supposed to be sprung\r\nfrom a common source, a social union, with common rights in private\r\nlaw, which had as its theoretical basis the notion of descent from a\r\nsingle ancestor. According to the juristic theory of the clan, all its\r\nindividual members would, if their descent could be traced through every\r\ndegree, have sprung from two individuals who were within the power of\r\nthis ultimate ancestor, a sign of this original _potestas_ being the\r\ncommon gentile name.[32]\r\n\r\nThe members of a clan are to one another either _agnati_ or _gentiles_.\r\nIn many cases the difference of nomenclature was based merely on the\r\ndegree of certainty in the relationship. They were _agnati_ when the\r\ncommon descent could be traced through all its stages; they were\r\n_gentiles_ when the common descent was only an imagined fact, based\r\non the possession of a common name. As a rule _agnati_ are also\r\n_gentiles_; but there might be groups of agnates who could never be\r\n_gentiles_—groups, that is, of proved relationship through the male line,\r\nwho could not, for reasons which we shall soon specify, form a _gens_.\r\n\r\nIf we believe that the Roman Patriciate represented those who alone\r\npossessed the legal status of heads of families (_patres_)[33]—since,\r\nthe _familia_ being the unit of the clan, the rights of a clan-member\r\n(_gentilis_) imply the position of a _paterfamilias_—it follows that the\r\nRoman _gentes_ were, as they are represented by tradition, originally\r\nexclusively patrician, and that the terms _gentilis_, _gentilitas_\r\nimplied a perfect equality of status among the only true members of the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nThe words became restricted to a certain section of the community in\r\nconsequence of the evolution of plebeian rights, i.e. in consequence\r\nof the Plebeians becoming in strict law _patres familias_. The logical\r\nconsequence of this should have been, where groups of such families\r\nbore a common name and were believed to have a common descent, that\r\nthese groups should form _gentes_. But history is illogical, and this\r\nconclusion was not reached.\r\n\r\nNo such group could possibly form a _gens_ of its own, if it could be\r\nregarded as having been originally in dependence on a patrician clan.\r\nAlthough in course of time legally independent and freed from all\r\ntrammels of clientship, it was yet disqualified from clan-brotherhood\r\nby this original connexion; it remained an offshoot (_stirps_), a mere\r\ndependent branch, and could never be a self-existent _gens_. This\r\ndisqualification is exhibited in the definition of _gentilitas_ given\r\nby the jurist Scaevola (consul 133 B.C.), which gives as two of its\r\nconditions free birth in the second degree, and the absence of servile\r\nblood in one’s ultimate ancestry.[34] This definition excludes from\r\nmembership of a _gens_ all those Plebeians who had sprung originally\r\nfrom emancipated slaves. No one who could be proved to have the taint\r\nof servile blood could ever be a _gentilis_. But there is every reason\r\nto believe that _servitus_ was interpreted in a further sense, that\r\nclientship was regarded as a quasi-servile position, and debarred a group\r\nof families, whose ancestor could be proved to be a client, for ever from\r\nbeing a clan.\r\n\r\nAs a rule it would have been difficult, if not impossible, to furnish\r\nthis proof; but there was one legal sign of it—the bearing by a plebeian\r\n_stirps_ of the same name as a patrician clan. The presumption of the\r\nlaw, in the case of the coexistence of a plebeian group of families\r\nwith a patrician group of the same name, was apparently that the former\r\nhad once been clients of the latter, and could never, therefore, form a\r\n_gens_ of their own.[35]\r\n\r\nBut, if there were plebeian families that had no origin in clientship,\r\nthere was nothing to prevent these from being _gentes_. It is true that\r\nPatricians sometimes made the claim that all the plebeian families had\r\noriginated from clientship.[36] But this is, as we saw,[37] probably\r\nnot true of the origin of many of the plebeian families, and there is\r\nabundant evidence that the theory was not recognised by law. We know, for\r\ninstance, that gentile inheritances were shared by the plebeian Minucii,\r\nand gentile sepulchres by the plebeian Popilii.[38]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing description shows that the _gens_ rests on a natural basis,\r\nthat it professedly represents the widest limits of blood-relationship;\r\nhence it would seem to follow that it could not be artificially created\r\nor its members redistributed; that the numbers of the clans could not\r\nbe regulated numerically, except conceivably by the addition to the\r\nexisting number of a precise number of added clans—a most improbable\r\nprocedure; and that, as being a natural and not an artificial creation,\r\nit was a union which was not likely to be of primary importance\r\npolitically, and the rights of whose members were in all probability\r\nthose of private rather than of public law. These expectations are\r\nverified, but the attempts to point out certain purely political\r\ncharacteristics of these associations deserve examination.[39]\r\n\r\n(i.) It has been held that the clans were the unit of voting in the\r\noriginal popular assembly at Rome, the _comitia curiata_.[40] But the\r\npassage on which this conclusion is based only implies that, originally,\r\nmembership of this _comitia_ depended on possession of a _gens_;\r\neventually, at a time when the _curia_ included Plebeians, on possession\r\nof a _familia_, and therefore presumably of a _stirps_ or _genus_.\r\n\r\n(ii.) A distinction is presented by ancient authorities between the\r\n_gentes majores_ and _minores_—a distinction within the patrician\r\n_gentes_ that survived into the Republic. Of the _gentes minores_ we know\r\nbut one name, that of the patrician Papirii;[41] a list of some of the\r\n_gentes majores_ has been reconstructed with some plausibility from those\r\nclans which furnished _principes senatus_; they are the Aemilii, Claudii,\r\nCornelii, Fabii, Manlii, and Valerii.[42] Tradition is inclined to\r\nrepresent this distinction as having originated politically,[43] but it\r\nis a tradition working on the impossible hypothesis that the Patriciate\r\nderived its origin from membership of the Senate. This political\r\ndistinction doubtless existed within the Senate; but it was probably\r\nderived merely from the respective antiquity, and therefore dignity, of\r\nthe _gentes_ from which its members were drawn. And this association\r\nwith the Senate leads us naturally to the third question connected with\r\nthe political character of the _gentes_, i.e. their relation to the\r\nprimitive council of the state. The theory of an ultimate connexion\r\nbetween the two originates with the correspondence of the number of the\r\n_gentes_ and of the Senate. Both are given by tradition as 300. The Roman\r\ncommunity is said to have originated with the amalgamation of three\r\ndomains (_tribus_) into one.[44] The rise of the Senate from 100, its\r\noriginal number as constituted by Romulus, to 300 as its final number,\r\nis accounted for by the gradual amalgamation of these three tribes with\r\ntheir 100 _gentes_ each.[45] A parallel to the original centumviral\r\nconstitution of the Senate is found in the _centumviri_ of the Italian\r\ntowns, and is supposed to be derived from the same invariable division of\r\na _tribus_ into 100 _gentes_.[46]\r\n\r\nThe chief objections to this view are the symmetrical number into which\r\nit divides the _gentes_, and the fact that the Senate is, according to\r\nthe best tradition, a body of nominees selected by the chief magistrate.\r\nBut yet there is an element of truth in the theory. The Senate did rise\r\nfrom 100 to 300 in consequence of the incorporation of fresh elements\r\ninto the community, and therefore in consequence of an increase of the\r\n_gentes_. The kings and early consuls would doubtless, in the exercise\r\nof their powers of selection, wish to see each of the patrician clans\r\nrepresented in their council. Hence the addition of new clans would add\r\nnew members to that body, and hence the inferior place occupied in the\r\nSenate by the _gentes minores_, the younger branch of the Patriciate.\r\n\r\nAlthough the clan itself was inexpansive, the number of the clans,\r\neven in the old patrician community, was not. It was possible for new\r\n_gentes_ to be added to the community, and even for old _gentes_ to\r\nquit it. Tradition speaks of the reception of six clans that had once\r\nbelonged to the parent state of Alba—the Cloelii, Curiatii, Geganii,\r\nJulii, Quinctilii (or Quinctii), and Servilii;[47] and Sabine races as\r\nwell, such as the Valerii,[48] are also said to have been admitted.\r\nThe reception of new _gentes_ was effected by the Patricians and, as\r\nwe should expect, by the assembly which represents the whole patrician\r\nbody, the _comitia curiata_, under the presidency of the king. They were\r\ncoopted by their peers,[49] and it is improbable that the patrician order\r\ncould have been recruited by the act of the king alone.[50] He might\r\nconceivably have chosen Plebeians as members of his advising body, the\r\nSenate, as the first consuls are said to have done,[51] although such\r\na selection is extremely improbable; but even this act would not have\r\nraised such Plebeians to the Patriciate. The admission of new _gentes_\r\nimplies that foreigners, or even a portion of the plebeian body, might\r\nbe coopted into the Patriciate; in the former case it might be the\r\nreception, in the latter the creation, of a _gens_. This possibility of\r\nrecruiting the patrician order—whether by the creation or reception of\r\n_gentes_—ceased during the Republic, because the assembly of the Curies\r\ncame eventually to admit Plebeians, and there was no political assembly\r\ncomposed exclusively of members who fulfilled all the conditions of being\r\n_gentiles_. The only instance of the expulsion of a _gens_ preserved by\r\nlegend is that of the Tarquinii; and the decree that this whole clan had\r\nforfeited its right to be a member of the Roman state is said to have\r\nbeen passed by the Populus.[52]\r\n\r\nThe account of _gentes_ being received into the Roman community is\r\naccompanied by a tradition of their keeping together in their new\r\nsettlement. Thus the Claudii, on the reception of the _civitas_, are\r\nsaid to have received a special tract of territory across the Anio for\r\nthemselves and their clients.[53] Such a tradition at once suggests\r\na close connexion between the _gens_ and the soil, which there is no\r\nreason to doubt. But the further questions have been raised, whether\r\nthe _gens_ as a whole was the owner of the land on which it settled,\r\nand whether this was the form of common possession recognised in early\r\nRome. It must be admitted that tradition knows nothing of such a tenure.\r\nDionysius represents the territory given to the Claudii as destined to\r\nbe divided up amongst the various _familiae_ of the _gens_;[54] while\r\nin other accounts of land-assignments we hear of such being made to the\r\n_curia_ (φράτρα)[55] or to individuals (_viritim_),[56] but never to\r\nthe clan. Yet a plausible theory of common possession has been based on\r\nthe survivals both of legal terms and of clan rights.[57] Amongst the\r\nterms describing early territorial possession we have, apart from _ager\r\npublicus_, the _heredium_ and the _ager privatus_. The private possession\r\nof the _heredium_ is attributed to Romulus,[58] and is thus regarded\r\nas a modification of some form of common tenure; and the _heredium_\r\nconsisted of only two _jugera_,[59] an amount obviously insufficient for\r\nthe maintenance of a family. Hence there must have been _ager privatus_\r\nas well, owned by some larger unit, and this unit would naturally have\r\nbeen the _gens_. It has also been thought that the terms descriptive\r\nof individual ownership—_manus_, _mancipium_—referred originally to\r\nmovables,[60] as though immovables belonged to a common stock. Lastly,\r\nwe find connected with the clan the survival of a corporate right to\r\nproperty and collective duties connected with it. According to the rules\r\nof regular intestate succession, in default of the _suus heres_, property\r\nlapses to the _proximus agnatus_ and then to the _gentiles_;[61] and\r\nit was in connexion with this right, which lasted down to the end of\r\nthe Republic,[62] that the definition of a _gentilis_ was of such legal\r\nimportance.[63] This inheritance is by the _gentiles_ as a whole, for\r\nthere is no _proximus gentilis_, and in historic times it must have\r\nbeen an inheritance by individuals, the property being divided amongst\r\nthose who could prove their claim; but it may be the relic of an earlier\r\ninheritance by the _gens_ as a corporation.\r\n\r\nBut the _gentiles_ have rights in a _corporate_ capacity as well. By\r\nthe Twelve Tables they have the guardianship of the insane[64] and\r\na reversionary right of guardianship over women and children.[65]\r\nGuardianship (_tutela_) must have given them all the rights of a\r\nperson in Roman law, to exercise which they must have had a personal\r\nrepresentative. But this devolution itself shows the _gens_ acting as a\r\ncorporation.\r\n\r\nOf corporate action in their own interests, or with a view to the\r\ninterests of the state, there is little evidence, although there are\r\ntraces of common activity for the purpose of keeping up the dignity of\r\nthe family. The patrician Claudii repudiate by common agreement the\r\n_praenomen_ “Lucius,” because two of its bearers had been respectively\r\nconvicted of highway robbery and murder,[66] and the patrician Manlii\r\nrenounce the _praenomen_ “Marcus” in consequence of a crime committed\r\nby a clansman of that name;[67] but such an agreement could hardly in\r\nhistorical times have had other support than the will of individual\r\nmembers to observe it. Perhaps the closest of the later ties of the\r\n_gens_ were its common worship and sacrifices. They never, as in Greece,\r\nrose to the rank of great public worships, but excessive care was taken\r\nby the state to maintain them; chiefly from the view that, if the worship\r\nof a race died out, the community would lose the favour of the divinity\r\nto which it had belonged. Hence the close connexion of gentile _sacra_\r\nwith property and inheritance.[68] Property, in the last resort, passed\r\nto the _gentiles_; and the _sacra_, that they might be maintained, were\r\na necessary burden associated with it. For the _sacra_ to pass out of\r\nthe family was of little importance; had they passed out of the _gens_,\r\nthere was no security for their continuance. In cases of transition from\r\na family of one clan to a family of another, it was the duty of the\r\n_pontifices_ to inquire how the continuity of the sacred rites might be\r\nmaintained,[69] and hence one of the forms observed in the case of a\r\nchange of _gens_ by adrogation was the _sacrorum detestatio_, a public\r\ndeclaration that the individual who sought this change had ceased to\r\nclaim any participation in the _sacra_ of his race. The care for the\r\ncontinuity of the _sacra_ of the clan was long one of the professed, and\r\nperhaps real, bars to marriage between Patricians and Plebeians.[70]\r\n\r\nThis question of the _sacra_ is an index to the fact that membership\r\nof a _gens_ might be either natural or artificial. The natural mode of\r\nentrance was by birth; and in the case of the patrician clans, before\r\nthe right of intermarriage was extended to the Plebs, marriage with a\r\npatrician mother and by the ceremony of the _confarreatio_ was necessary\r\nto constitute _gentilitas_ for the child. Later any form of marriage\r\nsufficed, as it had doubtless always done in the case of the plebeian\r\nclans. The child, in accordance with the patriarchal principle, belonged\r\nto the clan of his father.\r\n\r\nThe form of religious marriage peculiar to the Patricians necessitated\r\na change of _gens_ on the part of the wife; for a woman married by the\r\nceremony of _confarreatio_ became a partner in the property and _sacra_\r\nof her husband,[71] and there is even some trace of her having originally\r\nchanged her gentile name as well.[72] The ordinary plebeian form of\r\nmarriage by mere agreement (_consensus_), which ultimately became almost\r\nuniversal, did not lead to a woman’s falling into the _potestas_ of her\r\nhusband, unless this power were assumed, originally by prescriptive right\r\n(_usus_), later by the ceremony of fictitious purchase (_coemptio_).\r\nIn such a case she became a member of her husband’s family, but it is\r\nquestionable whether the logical conclusion was pressed and she also\r\nbecame a member of his _gens_. The anomaly, if it existed, may perhaps\r\nbe explained by the fact that the Plebeians, who evolved these forms of\r\nmarriage, had, as a rule, no _gentes_.\r\n\r\nThe clan might also be changed by adoption. _Adrogatio_—perhaps the\r\nonly form known to the old patrician community—was the method by which\r\nthe head of a family voluntarily submitted himself to the _potestas_ of\r\nanother. _Adoptio_, on the other hand, was the change from one _potestas_\r\nto another. If there was a form of true adoption by patrician law,[73]\r\nit has been lost to us, and the earliest that we hear of is the plebeian\r\nform by threefold sale recognised in the Twelve Tables. At a later period\r\nit might also be effected by a written testament.\r\n\r\nThe family (_familia_)[74] in its original and proper meaning is the\r\naggregate of members of a household under a common head; this head was\r\nthe _paterfamilias_—the _only_ member of the household who possesses\r\nlegal rights.\r\n\r\nThe two ideas underlying the Roman conception of the family are those of\r\nunity and power, and both are singularly perfect. The former is attained,\r\nand the latter exercised, by the head. It is through him alone that\r\nthe family is a person; and the authority he wields over the members\r\nsubordinated to his will is called _potestas_.[75] The power over the\r\nchildren is described as _patria potestas_, as over the slave it is\r\n_dominica_. The two do not differ legally; there is only a difference\r\nof ethical signification. Under this _potestas_ fall, firstly, the\r\nchildren, both sons and daughters; secondly, the descendants of these\r\nchildren; thirdly, the wife united to her lord by a form of marriage\r\nwhich makes her a member of the family; fourthly, the wives of the sons\r\nand grandsons who have entered the _familia_ by a similar binding form\r\nof marriage. There is a complete absence of independent rights amongst\r\nthese members of the household. As to the wife, any property that she\r\nmight be possessed of, or which she acquired, passed absolutely into the\r\npower of her husband. He was responsible for her conduct and possessed\r\nthe right of moderate chastisement. Severer punishment for wrongs to the\r\nhousehold required the support of the family council. No legal action\r\nmight be brought by the woman against her lord, for they were not two\r\npersonalities, but one. He might divorce her on good grounds,[76] but if\r\nshe were married under a form which subjected her to his power, she had\r\nno legal means of freeing herself from his tyrannous rule. Her position\r\nis that of a daughter and she inherits equally with her children. The\r\ndecision as to whether the child of the marriage was to be reared\r\n(_liberi susceptio_) belonged to the father, but was, in the interest\r\nof the state, subjected at an early period to certain modifications.\r\nThe “laws of Romulus”—that is, the early pontifical law—enjoined the\r\nrearing of every male child and of the first-born of the females; the\r\nexposure of offspring was to receive the assent of five neighbours,[77]\r\nand disobedience of these canons was to be visited with severe penalties\r\non the parent who neglected the welfare of the state. The children and\r\ntheir descendants are never released from the absolute rule of the\r\nfather as long as he lives. They cannot own property; for all that they\r\nacquire belongs to the common stock and is at the disposal of the head\r\nof the family. At best the father might permit the son, as he might\r\npermit the slave, to employ his own earnings for his own use. This is\r\nthe _peculium_. Yet the grant is a mere concession, and one which may be\r\nwithdrawn at any moment. If the son dies it lapses to the father; if the\r\nfather dies it falls to the heir.\r\n\r\nThe child, as having no property, cannot give satisfaction for\r\nwrongs which he has committed. He is regarded as irresponsible, and\r\nresponsibility for his conduct devolved on the father, who might either\r\ngive compensation to the injured man, or surrender the delinquent for\r\nhim to visit with his vengeance, or to use as a means of working out the\r\ndamage (_noxae deditio_);[78] in the latter case the child becomes for\r\never the property of another. The father might sell him; if beyond the\r\nlimits of the country, the son becomes a slave; if within the limits, he\r\nis one in private though not in public law (_in causa mancipii_), and\r\nexchanges servitude to the father for that to the purchaser. In an age\r\nwhich recognised no free contract of labour, the sale of the son was a\r\nmeans of putting him out to business.[79] The injunction of the Twelve\r\nTables (perhaps the recognition of a custom far earlier than this law)\r\nthat the thrice-repeated sale of a son involved loss of the _patria\r\npotestas_,[80] was an attempt to put an end to an inhuman traffic. The\r\nchild as a thing might be stolen or detained, and as such be the object\r\nof recovery. In this case the father “vindicates” him as he would a\r\nchattel or a beast that had strayed from the homestead.[81]\r\n\r\nThe father might scourge or imprison his child,[82] even put him to\r\ndeath. The formula employed in adrogation (the procedure by which a\r\nman puts himself into the paternal power of another) shows that the\r\n_jus vitae necisque_ was the most distinctive aspect of the _patria\r\npotestas_.[83] It was a power never questioned throughout the whole of\r\nRepublican history, and which received no legal limitations until the\r\ntime of the Middle Empire.[84] Sometimes it was employed as a means of\r\nsaving the honour of the family, and there are instances of the son\r\nguilty of theft, the daughter of unchastity, being thus put to death;[85]\r\nsometimes it was enforced in the interest of the state to punish a public\r\ncrime.[86]\r\n\r\nAlthough law is in a sense an outline of life, it would be very\r\nmisleading to fill up the content of Roman private life by analogy with\r\nthis harsh outline. Like most of the theory of Roman law it had little\r\ncorrespondence with the facts; and this non-correspondence of fact and\r\ntheory is the source of the strength and the beauty of Roman family life.\r\nIf legal obligations do not exist between husband and wife, father and\r\nchild, their place, in a civilised community, must be taken by moral\r\nobligations; and the very absence of legal sanctions will make these\r\nmoral bonds peculiarly strong. It was so with the Roman family. It was an\r\nisolated, self-existent unit. The members clung closely to one another\r\nand to their head. The power of the father—the source of the unity of the\r\nhousehold—fostered the devotion to the hearth, the love of home, which\r\nis such a distinctive attribute of the Roman. It created the belief that\r\nthe members of the household, owing allegiance to a common chief, should\r\nact loyally by one another in all the relations of life, and loyalty\r\nto a living head begat loyalty to his predecessors; traditions of this\r\nunion as persisting under the rule of a long line of deceased ancestors,\r\naccount for the hereditary policy of Roman houses—the championship of\r\nprinciples advocated for centuries by such clans as the Valerii, the\r\nPorcii, and the Claudii.\r\n\r\nThe moral influence on the _pater_ was also great. He defends, not\r\nhis own selfish rights, but the rights of a corporation dependent on\r\nhim; “self-help” is the essence of the principles of early Roman law.\r\nIn private matters the authority of the state is weak, that of the\r\nindividual strong. The rule of the Roman father was the benevolent\r\ndespotism that embraces many within the sphere of its despotic interests,\r\nthat forces others to observe its rights because its interests are\r\n_not_ personal, that produces a deep sense of moral and religious\r\nresponsibility towards the weak, a stern unyielding attitude towards the\r\nman who would infringe upon their rights. The only “individual” known to\r\nRoman law is the _paterfamilias_, but his was a glorified individuality,\r\nwhich, through its rule over the family, gathered strength to rule the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIf it be thought that the loss of character must have been proportionally\r\ngreat in the case of the dependent members of the household, it must\r\nbe remembered that the _patria potestas_ is, for the individual, a\r\ntransitory condition of things. Each subject member is preparing himself\r\nto be a _pater_ in his own right. With the death of the existing head,\r\n_all_ the hitherto dependent members are freed from the _potestas_; each\r\nforms a _familia_ of his own; even his grandchildren by predeceased\r\nsons become heads of houses; the daughters are also freed from power,\r\nalthough, out of deference to the weakness of the sex, they are still\r\nunder guardianship (_tutela_).[87] The family splits up into a number\r\nof _familiae_, and none of these is of more importance than the other.\r\nFor the evils of primogeniture were unknown to Roman law. No hereditary\r\ncaste based on the accident of birth was ever formed; and when we find\r\nan aristocracy of birth arising, it is the fittest son who can succeed\r\nhis father in political office; for the bulk of the property, on which\r\npolitical influence was based, has not passed into the hands of some\r\nincapable elder brother.\r\n\r\nBut, apart from the moral checks on the authority of the father, which\r\nthe absence of legal restraints made peculiarly strong, the civil law,\r\npublic opinion, and the positive morality which found expression through\r\ncertain religious or semi-religious organs, did impose certain restraints\r\non a possible abuse of power. If the father is a lunatic (_furiosus_)\r\nhe is, with his property, put under the care of his next of kin;[88] if\r\nhe is wasteful (_prodigus_) and is squandering the property, of which\r\n(though legally it is his own) he is regarded only as the trustee, he is\r\ndebarred from all commercial relations (_commercium_)[89] and prohibited\r\nfrom disposing of goods of which he is an unworthy administrator.\r\n\r\nA very real customary control, one not actually enjoined by the civil\r\nlaw, but enforced by the powerful sovereign, which the Romans called\r\nthe custom of their ancestors (_mos majorum_), was the obligation\r\nincumbent on the father of consulting a council of relatives (_consilium\r\ndomesticum_) before taking any extreme step with respect to the members\r\nof his family. This was never limited to the agnatic circle; it admitted\r\nblood relations and relatives by marriage, while personal friends outside\r\nthe family might be summoned as well.[90] Any severe punishment of a\r\nchild and the divorce of a wife had to be submitted to the judgment of\r\nthis assembly. How strong the sentiment in favour of this procedure\r\nwas may be judged from the fact that in later times we find the censor\r\n(in Republican times the personal exponent of the moral sense of the\r\ncommunity) degrading a senator who had divorced his wife without taking\r\nadvice of the family council.[91] The sentiment was but one expression\r\nof the principle which runs through the whole of Roman life, that no man\r\nshould act in an important matter without taking counsel of those best\r\nqualified to give it.\r\n\r\nCertain extreme abuses of the paternal power were prohibited by religious\r\nlaw (_fas_), which in such cases enjoins _capital_ penalties. By a\r\nsupposed law of Romulus, a man who sells his wife is to be sacrificed\r\nto the infernal gods; if he divorces her without due cause, half\r\nof his property is to be confiscated to his wife and half to the\r\ngoddess Ceres.[92] With the secularisation of Roman law such penalties\r\ndisappeared, and it is questionable whether they often required\r\nenforcement,[93] for such religious bans are mainly the expression of a\r\nstrong moral sentiment.\r\n\r\nLastly, there was the principle that the paternal power cannot interfere\r\nwith the _jus publicum_. It is a principle that applies both to persons\r\nand to property. In its first application it means that the son can\r\nexercise his vote independently of the paternal control; that he can\r\nfill a magistracy which subjects his father to his command; that, at\r\nleast in later times, even the function of guardianship (_tutela_) can be\r\nexercised without the father’s will; for this, too, is a public duty.[94]\r\nWith respect to property, public law, though not infringing on the theory\r\nthat all goods belong to the _paterfamilias_, yet does not regard them\r\nas the object of purely individual ownership. The father is rather a\r\ntrustee than an owner, and even under the Servian constitution, that is,\r\naccording to tradition, before the close of the monarchy, the value of\r\na freehold is taken to qualify the members of the _familia_, not merely\r\nits head, for service to the state, and ultimately for the exercise of\r\npolitical rights.[95]\r\n\r\nAn instance of the triumph of the state in its conflict with private\r\nproperty is furnished by the position of the bondsman (_nexus_). It\r\nmay be appropriately discussed here; for the _nexus_ is in private law\r\npractically in the position of the son under power. He was a man who\r\nhad contracted a debt on the security of his person,[96] and who, on\r\nnon-fulfilment of that obligation, had had his body and his services\r\nattached by the creditor. In private law he is a slave; in public law\r\nhe is a free-born Roman citizen, and may be summoned for service in the\r\nlegions when the state needs his help.\r\n\r\nIt would be an anachronism to enter on a full treatment of Roman\r\nslavery in connexion with the beginnings of Roman history. Almost all\r\nthat we know of the legal relations of slaves to their masters, of\r\ntheir capacities and their disabilities, their hopes of freedom, their\r\nposition in the home, and their influence on the public life of the city,\r\nrefers to a far later period. Yet the class doubtless existed from the\r\nearliest times, and as Roman legal conceptions became modified but never\r\ncompletely altered by the course of time, it is possible to give a faint\r\noutline of the conditions of slavery in the Regal and early Republican\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\nSlavery may at all periods of the history of Rome be defined as an\r\nabsence of personality. The slave was a thing (_res_) and belonged\r\nto that more valuable class of chattels which the Romans called _res\r\nmancipi_, and which included land and beasts of burden. He was,\r\ntherefore, a part of the homestead (_familia_),[97] the transfer of any\r\nportion of which required the most solemn forms of Roman law. As a thing,\r\nthe master is said to exercise _dominium_ over him; he might deal with\r\nhim as he pleased, and had over him the power of life and death. The\r\nslave, on the other hand, has not only no rights against his master, but\r\ncannot conclude legal relations with others. He has no legal relatives,\r\nno legal wife; he may be permitted to retain the fruits of his own\r\nlabour, but even his master’s will cannot make it his property. How far\r\nthis “thing” possessed a potential personality we do not know—how far,\r\nthat is, the personality inherent in him could be realised by subsequent\r\nemancipation. Liberation could at best have raised the slave to the\r\ncondition of the client at this early period—a slight ascent in the scale\r\nof actual rights, but one that might have been valued for the greater\r\npersonal freedom and the surer guarantee of religious protection which it\r\ngave. But the fact that the slave is a part of the homestead, and at the\r\nsame time an intelligent being, makes him in the truest sense a member of\r\nthe family. The owner is said to have power (_potestas_) over him, a word\r\nwhich is used only of rule over reasonable beings; and this _dominica\r\npotestas_ does not differ essentially from the _patria potestas_ which is\r\nexercised over the son. The treatment of the two was doubtless different,\r\nfor the one would some day be a lord, the other would remain a slave, but\r\ntheir legal relation to the _dominus_ was the same.\r\n\r\nBut the legal status of the slave is no true index of his condition.\r\nThis will depend on two factors, his origin and his _social_ relations\r\nto his master; and on both these grounds the early slavery of Rome must\r\nhave compared favourably with that of later times. The slave trade was\r\nprobably unknown, and the condition must have been mainly the result\r\nof capture in war from neighbouring states. Slavery is not altogether\r\ndegrading when it is wholly the consequence of the laws of war. The\r\nslave was an Italian, perhaps of as noble birth as his master, and this,\r\nthough it may have aggravated the bitterness of the lot, must have\r\nrendered possible an intimate social intercourse which would not have\r\nbeen possible with the barbarian, and must have forced on the master’s\r\nmind the conviction that a sudden turn in fortune’s wheel might place\r\n_him_ in the same position in the city of his serf. Again, the servitude\r\nwas domestic; whether employed in the home, or on the common lands of\r\nthe clan, or on the petty plot of ground that the master called his own,\r\nthe slave was never severed from his master or his master’s kindred.\r\nWe hear in early times of his sitting at his master’s table,[98] and\r\nof his being the tutor and playmate of his lord’s children.[99] He may\r\nin some cases have been better off than the client or the unattached\r\nPlebeian engaged in some petty trade. Certainly the opportunities for the\r\nprimitive culture afforded by the Roman household were more open to him\r\nthan to the other orders excluded from the Patriciate. In the case of\r\ndomestic slavery extending over a small area, public opinion is generally\r\na powerful restraint on the master’s caprice. We do not know whether this\r\nopinion found a religious expression in such principles as those which\r\nprotected the client’s rights; but the fact that the censor of the later\r\nRepublic, who perpetuates the obligations of religious law, punishes acts\r\nof cruelty committed by the _dominus_,[100] may show that the slave was\r\nnot wholly without the pale of divine protection.\r\n\r\nIf, as we have seen, the Roman’s chief mode of livelihood, the land, was\r\nnot his own property but that of the clan, no individual disposition\r\nof it during lifetime or after death was possible, although there may\r\nhave been some right of bequest over the movables classed as _res nec\r\nmancipi_. When the theory of common possession was modified by the\r\nrecognition of a heritable allotment, bequest may have become possible;\r\nbut doubtless intestate inheritance still continued to be the rule. A law\r\nof inheritance is first known to us from the Twelve Tables, which allowed\r\nthe utmost freedom of bequest and legacy; but there was a survival both\r\nof theories and practices which show that testamentary disposition was\r\noriginally regarded as the exception and not the rule.\r\n\r\nFirst, we may notice that even in later times the immediate heirs of a\r\nman were regarded as having a claim to property, a kind of potential\r\nownership, during the lifetime of the _pater_, and that inheritance is\r\nregarded merely as a continuation of ownership (_dominium_);[101] and in\r\naccordance with this view we find the practice of holding an inheritance\r\nin joint ownership, the co-heirs bearing the name of _consortes_.[102]\r\n\r\nSecondly, the earliest testaments of which we have knowledge were\r\npublic acts performed before the _comitia_ of the people. The most\r\nancient was the patrician form of testament—the _testamentum comitiis\r\ncalatis_—effected at the _comitia curiata_ which were summoned\r\n(_calata_) twice a year for this purpose.[103] The original purpose of\r\nthis public testament is obscure. It is possible that originally it\r\ntook place when there was no direct heir (_suus heres_) to receive the\r\ninheritance, and that it was accompanied by some form of adoption of\r\na successor. The person adopted might have been the son belonging to\r\nanother family; although of such a procedure there is no further trace in\r\nRoman law.[104]\r\n\r\nThe publicity of the act and the infrequency of its occurrence show\r\nhow exceptional a will must have been, and that the normal mode of\r\nsuccession was that by intestacy. But we have no warrant for saying\r\nthat this testament at the _comitia calata_ was an act of private\r\nlegislation and was permitted by the assembled burgesses. The gathering\r\nwas perhaps merely a form, and the persons assembled may have acted only\r\nas witnesses;[105] but the very publicity would have made it almost\r\nimpossible to pass over a son of the family, unless there were expressed\r\ngrounds for his disinheritance.\r\n\r\nThe second kind of public will was the military testament (_in\r\nprocinctu_),[106] but our authorities leave us in doubt as to whether\r\nthis testament could be made in any gathering of the soldiers prepared to\r\nmeet the enemy and in any place, or whether it was a formal act possible\r\nonly in the great gathering of the _exercitus_ in the Campus Martius—that\r\ngathering which was finally organised as a legislative assembly, existed\r\nby the side of the assembly of the Curies, and came to be known as the\r\n_comitia centuriata_.\r\n\r\nIn the first case it may have been an old patrician form of testament, an\r\ninformal will permitted in an emergency, perhaps to enable a childless\r\nsoldier to transmit his inheritance. We do not know whether it had\r\nabsolute validity, or only a validity dependent on circumstances, such as\r\nthe absence of direct heirs, or the satisfaction of religious conditions\r\napproved by subsequent pontifical scrutiny; on this hypothesis the\r\ncomrades of the testator could hardly have acted other than as witnesses\r\nto the will.\r\n\r\nOn the second hypothesis it would have a closer analogy to the testament\r\nmade in the _comitia calata_, and may have been introduced only when\r\nPlebeians were admitted to political rights in this assembly. It is true\r\nthat this is not a necessary conclusion, for the _patres_ gathered armed\r\nfor war in the Campus long before the enrolment of the Plebs for military\r\nduties or their admission to political rights; but we may at least say\r\nthat, when this enrolment and admission were effected, this form of\r\ntestament could be used by the Plebeians. If we accept the traditional\r\ndate for the Servian constitution, it was common to the two orders before\r\nthe close of the monarchy.\r\n\r\nBut there was a third type of will, one purely plebeian, which from\r\nthe comparative simplicity of its form and the readiness with which\r\nit could be employed (since it did not depend either on chance or\r\nformal gatherings of the people) gradually came, in its subsequent\r\ndevelopments, to replace all others, and became the prevailing Roman\r\nform of testament-making. This was the testament _per aes et libram_,\r\none use of the _mancipatio_ or solemn transference of property “by\r\nthe copper and the scales.” In the form in which it is known to us,\r\nit is a late development, for the sale of the property has entirely\r\nceased to be a real, and has become a fictitious sale; the mancipation\r\nin fact has become a mere formality, and its employment is said to\r\nhave been dependent on the condition that the testator “subita morte\r\nurguebatur”[107]—a condition which implies that the comitial testament\r\ncould in ordinary cases be resorted to. But as the Plebs had originally\r\nno access to this form of will, the testament _per aes et libram_\r\nmust have been in use among them long before its recognition as a\r\nform valid for the whole community. It was then regarded as a mere\r\nformal application of the mancipation to a special emergency, and as\r\nsupplementary to the comitial testament; until its superior utility\r\ncame to be recognised, the sentiment in favour of a free disposition of\r\nproperty grew to be strong, and the Twelve Tables, which effected the\r\ntriumph of plebeian over patrician forms of procedure, recognised it as\r\nthe normal mode of testate disposition.\r\n\r\nBy this act the testator, in the presence of five witnesses and the\r\n_libripens_, transferred the whole of his patrimony (_familia_) into\r\nthe custody and guardianship of a person called “the purchaser of the\r\nfamily” (_familiae emptor_). In order to make a legal disposition of his\r\nproperty the vendor makes a formal announcement of the purport of the\r\nsale, and the buyer, as he pays the single copper coin for the patrimony,\r\nrepeats the same form of words, “Let my custody and guardianship of your\r\npatrimony be purchased by this coin, to the effect that you may make a\r\nlegal testament in accordance with public law.”[108] The words, which\r\nmay not represent the most ancient formula, show that the _familiae\r\nemptor_ is a mere trustee. Although the transference does not appear\r\nto have been conditioned by any express stipulation on the part of the\r\nvendor,[109] it was understood that it should only take effect on the\r\ndeath of the testator. On this the _familiae emptor_ becomes guardian of\r\nthe patrimony. He is not an heir but an executor, who distributes the\r\nproperty in accordance with the instructions of the testator from whom he\r\nhas purchased.\r\n\r\nThe second stage is reached by the added importance given to the form of\r\ninstruction (_nuncupatio_) uttered by the vendor. The Twelve Tables gave\r\nabsolute validity to such instructions,[110] and the mere expression of\r\nthe will of the testator came to be considered the essential part of the\r\ntestament. In this announcement a true heir (_heres_) could be mentioned,\r\nand the _familiae emptor_ sinks into the background. It is true that\r\nhis presence is still necessary to the ceremony; he still professes to\r\ntake the patrimony into his guardianship; but, like the man who holds\r\nthe scales and the five witnesses, he is merely a formal assistant. The\r\ntestament has ceased to be a contract; it is a one-sided expression of\r\nwill and an arbitrary disposition of property. It may be either verbal or\r\nwritten; the last stage in the history of the civil testament is reached\r\nwhen the testator is allowed to exhibit a document to the witnesses of\r\nthe mancipation with these words, “These waxen tablets contain my will\r\nand bequest; I ask you, Quirites, for your testimony.”[111]\r\n\r\nThus at a very early stage of Roman history, perhaps as early as the\r\nmiddle of the fifth century B.C., a man could exercise the most absolute\r\npower over the disposal of his goods. The only limitation was that the\r\ndirect heirs (_sui heredes_) must be formally disinherited if they were\r\nto lose their rights. A mere passing over of a _filius familias_ without\r\nformal disinheritance (_exheredatio_) rendered the will invalid; and in\r\nthis case the _sui_ succeeded to the vacant estate.\r\n\r\nThe social and political effects of such a dangerous liberty as the\r\nright of arbitrary testamentary disposition depend upon its use, and\r\nits use depends on the character of the people. The Roman character\r\nwas, at all periods of history, devoted to the hereditary theory. It is\r\none that was so strongly believed in that it asserted itself in spheres\r\nwhere it was never contemplated—during the later Republic in succession\r\nto office, in the early Empire in the succession to the Principate—and\r\nas applied to property it was an essential condition of the permanence\r\nof the Roman family. For the maintenance of a house a rigid system of\r\nintestate inheritance is bad; it may not produce great wealth, but it\r\noften produces great poverty. The only satisfactory system is a minute\r\nexamination of each particular case by the state or by individuals.\r\nSuch a control by the state was utterly alien to the _laisser faire_\r\nprinciples of the Roman, and history shows that the Decemvirs were right\r\nwhen they entrusted this discretionary power wholly to the _pater_. His\r\nfunctions as trustee were but extended to a period beyond his lifetime,\r\nand freedom of bequest was used as a means of equitable adjustment of\r\nproperty to the circumstances of the members of the family. The son who\r\nhad made a rich marriage need not receive so much; the one destined to\r\ncarry on the family traditions of office might receive more than the\r\nothers. To him the _heredium_ might be given, while the younger sons\r\nwere drafted into colonies. We do not know the principles; but that the\r\nprinciples tended to the preservation of the family is proved by the long\r\ntraditions of the noble Roman houses.\r\n\r\nA legal view of the Roman family would be incomplete without\r\nconsideration of the rights or infringement of rights dependent on it.\r\n\r\nThe full legal status of a Roman citizen was designated by the word\r\n_caput_. It denoted all the rights that he possessed, but primarily it is\r\na conception of public law, for the possession of private was originally\r\nregarded as an annexe to the possession of public rights. Thus _caput_\r\nis retained even though the exercise of private rights is hindered for a\r\ntime, as it is in the case of a son under power; the _filius familias_\r\npossesses a _caput_, although it is modified by his subjection to his\r\nfather. This theory of the dependence of private on public rights, common\r\nto Greek and Roman law, probably accounts for the perpetual tutelage of\r\nwomen. The _materfamilias_ holds an honourable position in the household;\r\nshe is its queen, as her husband is its king, but yet she is subjected\r\nby marriage to the legal position of her own daughter, and, on her\r\nhusband’s death, is in the custody of her sons; for a primitive society\r\ncannot be brought to believe that a being who cannot fight, and may not\r\nfill offices of state or exercise a vote, is capable of looking after\r\nits own interests. Appearance before a court of law at Rome, whether for\r\nthe purpose of defending one’s own or another’s rights, was regarded\r\nas a public act; and Roman sentiment so strongly disapproved a woman’s\r\ntaking part in public life that, when one was found bold enough to plead\r\nher cause in the Forum, the Senate in alarm made an official inquiry of\r\nthe gods what the portent signified.[112] It is possible that in the\r\nearliest stage of Roman law women were not regarded as having any rights\r\nto defend; later they are regarded as having rights, and therefore a\r\n_caput_, but as incapable of defending them. When, in the latest stage,\r\nthe disabilities of sex disappear partly through enactment,[113] but\r\nchiefly through a series of legal fictions, the capacity of women to\r\ndefend their own interests first emerges.[114]\r\n\r\nThe limitation by which a series of civil rights is destroyed is spoken\r\nof as a “lessening of _caput_” (_capitis deminutio_). It is in every\r\ncase an infringement of rights already possessed by the individual. Now\r\nthe loss of public rights could only follow on a loss of citizenship;\r\nbut this is not the diminution but the annihilation of _caput_, and\r\ncould not therefore in the earliest stage of Roman law (when there was\r\nno status recognised but that of citizenship) be called a _capitis\r\ndeminutio_. The term must have been wholly confined to a loss of private\r\nrights, i.e. to the loss of the rights conveyed by the control of a\r\n_familia_.[115] Thus the _adrogatus_ suffers a lessening of _caput_ by\r\npassing into the power of another. But a change from a higher to a lower\r\nstatus (even when the higher did not imply active rights) may at an early\r\nperiod have been regarded as an infringement of _caput_. We know, for\r\ninstance, that the _datio in mancipium_ of a son of a family was thought\r\n(at what period is uncertain) to involve it, because the child passes\r\nfrom a better to a worse station, although in his former condition he\r\nhad no active rights of his own. It is stranger still that, certainly\r\nat an early period, the fact of a woman’s passing into her husband’s\r\npower (_conventio in manum_) was held to have this consequence. It is\r\none that is scarcely intelligible in the case of a _filia familias_ who\r\npasses from one _potestas_ to another; but in the case of a woman only\r\nunder the burden, lighter and ever tending to be more relaxed, of the\r\n_tutela_ of her relatives, it is a natural though not strictly legal\r\nconception.[116] Some other applications of the system are still more\r\nartificial, and are perhaps creations of late Roman jurists who came to\r\nconsider that the essence of a loss of _caput_ was a change of status\r\n(_status commutatio_).[117] Thus adoption, which is the change from\r\none _potestas_ to another, and even manumission, which is the freedom\r\nfrom power, were supposed to involve it. These applications contain some\r\nhistorical truth only in so far as both these changes involve a temporary\r\nmancipation.\r\n\r\nThe original _capitis deminutio_ is thus a purely private law conception\r\nand implies the distinction between persons _sui juris_ and _alieni\r\njuris_. To the first category belong those who are free from the power of\r\nanother, to the latter those who are under the _potestas_, _manus_, and\r\n_mancipium_; amongst citizens, therefore, the son, the wife, and any one\r\nmancipated to another. The person _alieni juris_ is not altogether devoid\r\nof private rights, but they are singularly incomplete in their effects.\r\nThus the son under power has the right of marriage (_conubium_), but the\r\nchildren of the marriage are not in his power but in his father’s; he\r\nhas (if not in the earliest period, yet throughout the greater part of\r\nRoman history) the right of taking part in the legal business of trade\r\n(_commercium_), yet all that he acquires by this business belongs to his\r\nfather. In his case, however, the condition is transitory, while in the\r\ncase of the slave and the _mancipatus_ (apart from the possibility of\r\nemancipation) it is permanent.\r\n\r\nConversely, the fact of being _sui juris_ does not always imply freedom\r\nof action; this might be limited through consideration of age or sex.\r\nMinors and women may be free from _potestas_, but the former were subject\r\nto a temporary, the latter originally to a perpetual _tutela_.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4. _The Citizens and the Political Subdivisions of the State_\r\n\r\nThe whole collection of Roman citizens forms the _populus Romanus\r\nquiritium_,[118] or _populus Romanus quirites_.[119] Of the terms thus\r\nplaced in apposition, _populus Romanus_ is the more general descriptive\r\nname, and _quirites_ the official title by which the citizens are\r\naddressed in the assembly. Yet both words appear to have the same\r\nsignification; _populus_ is the armed host,[120] and the _quirites_ are\r\nthe “_bearers of the lance_.”[121] If the latter etymology is correct,\r\nthe word _quirites_ came, by a course of development which finds many\r\nparallels in Roman history, to mean exactly the opposite of its original\r\nsignification. At the end of the Republic it signifies the citizens in\r\ntheir purely civil capacity, wearing the _toga_, the garb of peace, and\r\nexercising political functions within the city; Caesar once quelled a\r\nmutiny of his legions by addressing them as _quirites_, showing by this\r\naddress that they were disbanded and were no longer soldiers.[122]\r\n\r\nA more real historical difficulty with respect to the original\r\nconnotation of these words, is to determine whether they denoted the\r\nwhole people, Plebeians as well as Patricians. Roman records do not use\r\n_populus_ as equivalent to the patrician community alone; but these\r\nrecords all refer to a time after the Plebeians had won political\r\nrights, at least the rights of serving in the legions and of voting. If\r\n_populus_ and _quirites_ denoted the aggregate of fighting, and therefore\r\nprivileged, men, they must have originally referred exclusively to the\r\npatrician community. After the Servian constitution the words denote the\r\nwhole people (_universus populus_). _Populus_ and _plebs_ are henceforth\r\nonly distinguished as the whole to the part—the distinction being\r\nnecessary, since the Plebs continued to form a corporation apart, and\r\nthis corporation excluded the patrician families.[123] So, in a later\r\nofficial formula, _senatus populusque Romanus_ denotes two corporations,\r\nthe latter composed of all the members of the state, but in this the\r\nindividual members of the smaller corporation are included.\r\n\r\n_Civis_, a word of uncertain origin, signifies less definitely than\r\n_quirites_ the possession of active political rights. Hence its\r\napplication to women and to the partially-privileged members of the\r\nstate—to those who were, at certain periods of Roman history, given\r\nrights in private law, while debarred from the exercise of the suffrage\r\nor the attainment of office. It is possible that the distinction between\r\nthe full citizen (_civis optimo jure_) and the partial citizen (_civis\r\nnon optimo jure_), although probably not a primitive,[124] may yet be an\r\nancient conception of Roman law. Those Plebeians who had never been,\r\nor who had ceased to be, entirely dependent on a _patronus_ for the\r\nexercise of their legal rights, would practically have belonged to this\r\nlatter class. Before the reform of Servius, which gave them political\r\nprivileges, they might have been called _cives_; it is only after this\r\nreform that they could have been called _quirites_. It was, perhaps, in\r\nconsequence of this change in the constitution that _cives_ replaced\r\n_quirites_ as the designation of the full citizens with reference to all\r\ntheir rights.\r\n\r\nIf we ask what the original rights of the citizen of Rome were, it is\r\nimpossible to frame a simple category applicable to all the _cives_.\r\nTaking our stand at a period just before the Servian reforms, we find\r\nthat private rights were possessed in varying degrees by all the members\r\nof the community. These rights are generally summed up as those of\r\ntrade and of marriage (_commercii et conubii_). The first is the legal\r\ncapacity to acquire full rights in every kind of property, to effect its\r\nacquisition, and to transfer it by the most binding forms, and to defend\r\nthe acquired right in one’s own person by Roman process of law (_legis\r\nactio_). This _commercium_ was possessed equally by the Patricians and\r\nthe free Plebeians. It was no infringement of the right of commerce that\r\nthe right of occupying domain-land wrested from the enemy may for a long\r\ntime have been possessed only by the dominant order;[125] for such land\r\nwas not acquired, but only held on a precarious tenure from the state,\r\nand the privilege was, perhaps, one of fact rather than of law. The _jus\r\nconubii_ is the right to conclude a marriage which is regarded as fully\r\nvalid by the state (_matrimonium legitimum_ or _jure civili_), and which,\r\ntherefore, gives rise to the _patria potestas_. This right was possessed\r\nby the Patricians and by at least the free Plebeians, but by each class\r\nonly within itself. There was no right of intermarriage between the\r\norders, and the member of each effected his position as a father by\r\na different ceremony.[126] The rights consequent on membership of a\r\nclan—those of inheritance and of religious communion—were, as we saw,\r\nprobably shared with the Patricians by those Plebeians at least whose\r\nancestors had never been in a condition of clientship.\r\n\r\nPublic rights—those of voting, of serving as a fully-equipped soldier\r\nin the legions, and probably of holding office as a delegate of\r\nthe king—were possessed exclusively by the Patricians; and to these\r\nprivileges we must add the right of holding the fullest communion with\r\nthe gods (_jus auspiciorum_).\r\n\r\n_Auspicium_, or the divination by birds, came eventually to be applied to\r\nany circumstance that might be interpreted as an expression of the will\r\nof the gods. The capacities of human beings with reference to these signs\r\nare partly a right of invoking, partly a power of interpreting them. Both\r\nthe right and the power rest on the assumption that there is a medium of\r\nintercourse between the national gods and the citizens of the state,[127]\r\nand the peculiarities of the conception which the Romans formed of this\r\ndivine patronage are shown by their views both of the nature of the\r\nrevelation and of the qualifications requisite for the “medium.”\r\n\r\n(i.) The revelation is not an answer to a question about future events,\r\nfor true divination is not an attempt to pry into the hidden counsels\r\nof the gods; this profession of the Chaldaeans was never looked on with\r\nfavour at Rome, and no science of the future was encouraged by the state.\r\nThe Roman consultation of the gods is only employed as the test of the\r\nrightness of an already formed human resolution.[128] It tells men only\r\nwhether they are to carry out a course of action already purposed; it may\r\nconfirm them in it or warn them from it; and it is the duty of men to\r\nseek a sign either of encouragement or of warning. It is of the highest\r\nimportance to remember this view of the guidance of the gods, for it\r\nis the chief sign of the way in which the Romans, in spite of their\r\ngenuinely religious spirit (nay, as an outcome of it), subordinated the\r\ntheocratic to the lay element. The chief effect of this subordination\r\nis the unfettered use of human reason; religion is employed as a test,\r\nrather than as a guide, of rightness of action. This is a thoroughly\r\nlay view of the function of religion in life, very unlike that of the\r\nJewish prophet who questions God in detail, but only for interpretation\r\nof a law which is the product of His, not of the human will. The\r\nbelief that the gods do not give instruction, but merely advice, gave\r\nan “inward freedom” to the Roman, which made him at times resent the\r\ndivine interference, and we shall find many instances of his forcing an\r\ninterpretation to suit his wishes. The omen that is not seen need not\r\nbe attended to, and precautions are taken that it shall not be seen. In\r\nundertaking acts of state, the magistrates are bound to ask for signs;\r\nbut all the efforts of human ingenuity are directed to secure that the\r\nsigns shall be favourable.[129]\r\n\r\n(ii.) It is plain that, on this theory of religious intervention, no\r\npriestly medium is required between the gods and their worshippers.\r\nDivination as the science of the future is an elaborate art, which\r\ncannot be possessed by the ordinary man. It requires the knowledge of\r\nritual to compel the divine utterance; it assumes that the gods have\r\nspecial confidence in the select participators of an inner cultus, to\r\nwhom they reveal what is hidden from the many; it requires the devotion\r\nof a lifetime, and often special rules of asceticism and purity, to\r\ninterpret the hidden signs; it leads, in short, to the belief in oracular\r\npower, in the prophetic gift, in the claims of a priesthood specially\r\nset apart.[130] There was none of this at Rome. The right of invoking\r\nauspices is not a priestly gift; it is one that is possessed, in a higher\r\ndegree by the magistrate, in a lower degree by all the full citizens of\r\nthe primitive Roman community. It is true that there is a class of wise\r\nmen, the augurs, whose chief function is the interpretation of signs,\r\nbut their function is limited to interpretation; they have no more power\r\nthan any private individual, and less power than the magistrate, of\r\neliciting such a revelation. Yet, if the assistance of the augur was\r\ncalled in, and his interpretation given, this verdict was final. We are\r\ntold that disobedience to it, at least by the magistrate in taking the\r\npublic auspices, was in early times visited with a capital penalty;[131]\r\na statement which probably means that the heads of the Roman religion,\r\nthe pontiffs, reckoned such an impiety as one for which the gods\r\nwould accept no expiation, and for which, therefore, the penalty of\r\nexcommunication (_sacer esto_) was pronounced.\r\n\r\nThe right of taking the auspices is said to have been a gift peculiar to\r\nthe Patricians; but the extent of this gift can be estimated only with\r\nreference to a fourfold division of the auspices, which, from its nature,\r\nmust have been primitive and not a creation of the later _disciplina_ of\r\nthe augurs.\r\n\r\nThe auspices were divided into _impetrativa_ (or _impetrita_) and\r\n_oblativa_.[132] The _auspicia impetrativa_ were those which were sought\r\nand asked for, and such signs might be taken from observation of the sky\r\nor from the flight or sounds of birds. The _oblativa_ were those which\r\nwere forced on the attention, and which, since they were not sought,\r\nwere generally regarded as an impediment to action, and, therefore, as\r\nunfavourable. They were gathered from a heterogeneous collection of signs\r\nof ill-omen (_dirae_). It is plain that the right to take or, as it is\r\nexpressed, to have auspices (_habere auspicia_) can refer only to the\r\nfirst of these two categories; it was this right that was assumed to be\r\npeculiar to the Patricians; it was the members of the original clans\r\nalone, the primitive _patres_, who had the right of asking signs of the\r\ngods, and it was held that every important act of their lives, whether\r\npublic or private, should be pervaded by this divine intercourse. It was\r\nbelieved that it was through auspices that the city had been raised,\r\npolitical development attained, and former victories won.[133] The\r\nexistence of the patrician order is from this point of view a necessary\r\ncondition of the existence of the state itself, for without it the right\r\nof eliciting the divine will would be wholly lost.[134] But no human\r\npower could prevent the Plebeians from following the religious scruples\r\nof their betters in giving heed to those warnings which were thrust upon\r\ntheir notice. The _auspicia oblativa_, whether the gods destined them for\r\nothers besides the patrician body or not, must from the earliest times\r\nhave been respected by the Plebeians, and have guided their political\r\nconduct when they became a corporation within the state.\r\n\r\nThe right of _taking_ auspices was neither a priestly nor even a\r\nmagisterial function, but was possessed by every Patrician. But the man\r\nin a private capacity could exercise it only in his private concerns; the\r\nauspices destined to guide public action are vested in the person of the\r\npatrician magistrate. Hence the distinction between _auspicia publica_\r\nand _privata_. There was a time when no important act of business or\r\ndomestic life was undertaken without an appeal for divine guidance.[135]\r\nMarriage especially demanded the taking of the auspices; and even when\r\nthe custom of such private divination had become wholly discarded, a\r\nsurvival of the custom is found in the presence of _auspices_, friends of\r\nthe bridegroom who superintend the due performance of the rites.[136] The\r\n_confarreatio_ was older than the traditional institution of the augural\r\ncollege, and it is not probable that official intervention was brought\r\nto bear on marriage, still less on such concerns as were more strictly\r\nprivate. Hence it is difficult to see how the Plebeians could have been\r\nprevented from taking the _auspicia privata_, although their use of them\r\nwas probably scoffed at by their patrician rulers. On the one hand, we\r\nfind that the incapacity of the Plebeians to share in the auspices was\r\none of the arguments used against the permission of _conubium_ between\r\nthe orders;[137] on the other, that the _auspex_ continues to be an\r\nintegral part of a ceremony which was founded on plebeian marriage law.\r\n\r\nIt was different with the auspices taken on behalf of the state\r\n(_auspicia publica_). It is the Patricians alone who have these auspices,\r\nand only a magistrate belonging to the order can exercise the right\r\nof looking for them (_spectio_).[138] This remains not only a purely\r\nmagisterial, but a purely patrician privilege, and the so-called\r\nplebeian magistrates of later times, great as their power was, had not\r\nthe gift. It is quite true that, after the Plebs had forced its way into\r\nthe consulship, this right could not be denied to the plebeian holders of\r\nthe supreme office. But the admission was based on the legal fiction that\r\nthe holder of an office once reserved to the _patres_ was, for religious\r\npurposes, a patrician magistrate.[139]\r\n\r\nThe enjoyment of full political rights in ancient Rome was conditioned\r\nonly by membership of a patrician _gens_; full citizenship here, as in\r\nmost ancient states, being dependent on birth, and the membership of a\r\npurely private association satisfying all the demands that the state made\r\nas a condition of the attainment of its rights. But there were other\r\nforms of association of a definitely political character, amongst which\r\nthe citizens were distributed, and as members of which they exercised\r\nactive political rights or were subject to personal burdens. These were\r\nthe three patrician tribes of Ramnes, Tities, and Luceres, and the thirty\r\n_curiae_. With reference to the question whether these were primary and\r\nnatural associations of an ethnic character or artificial creations\r\nmade by a supreme authority after the founding of Rome, we have already\r\nseen[140] that the _tribus_ are probably an ethnic survival artificially\r\nemployed; in the case of the _curiae_, it must remain far less certain\r\nwhether they were of spontaneous growth or purely artificial creations,\r\nor (what is perhaps more probable) in the main natural associations,\r\nartificially regulated in number and grouping to suit a political purpose.\r\n\r\nThe tribe, which was a division not merely of the citizen body but of\r\nthe land, was the basis for taxation and the military levy.[141] We\r\nknow nothing of the first burden, but it is probable that no detailed\r\nscheme of direct taxation existed in the early Roman state. The revenues\r\nfrom the king’s domains probably rendered him self-sufficing, while\r\nthe patrician burgesses served in the army at their own cost, and were\r\ndoubtless expected to defray the expenses of their retainers. It is\r\nprobable that in cases of emergency a tax in kind was levied from the\r\nlandholders of the tribes.\r\n\r\nOf the military burdens tradition has preserved some plausible details.\r\nThe army was known as the _legio_ or “gathering,”[142] and was composed\r\nof three “thousands” (_milites_),[143] one from each of the three tribes.\r\nThese foot-soldiers were commanded by three or nine tribal officers, the\r\n_tribuni militum_.[144] The cavalry consisted of three hundred _celeres_,\r\none from each of the three tribes, each commanded by three _tribuni\r\ncelerum_. When the Patriciate was enlarged by the addition of the _gentes\r\nminores_,[145] these three hundreds (_centuriae_) were increased to\r\nsix.[146]\r\n\r\nBesides the heavy infantry and the cavalry, there may have been a corps\r\nof light-armed troops (_velites_ and _arquites_), and these would\r\ndoubtless have been composed mainly of clients. We do not know whether\r\nthe free Plebeians were forced to serve; but, if they did, it would only\r\nhave been in this inferior capacity, which required no time for training\r\nand no cost of maintaining a panoply. It is evident that the whole burden\r\nof the regular levy, and of such war-taxation as then existed, fell upon\r\nthe Patricians, and before the close of the monarchy an effort was made\r\nto remedy this unequal distribution of burdens—an effort which had as its\r\nresult the abolition of the patrician tribes as the leading divisions of\r\nthe state and a serious infringement of patrician rights.\r\n\r\nThe thirty _curiae_, originally local units, as is proved by their\r\nnames,[147] were divided, ten into each of the three tribes. The members\r\nof the clans belonging to the same _curia_ were called _curiales_. But,\r\nalthough the _curiae_ had local centres, membership of these bodies did\r\nnot depend on residence in a given locality. It was hereditary; and if\r\nthe members of a _gens_ migrated from its _curia_, the _gentiles_ were\r\nstill members of that state-division. The _curiae_ were religious as\r\nwell as political associations, which had from the first, or finally\r\ndeveloped, a close corporate life. Each had its peculiar _sacra_[148] and\r\na place of worship, containing an altar and chapel, which itself bore\r\nthe name _curia_;[149] and the religious affairs of each were conducted\r\nby a priest called _curio_, assisted by a _flamen curialis_.[150] The\r\nthirty _curiones_ formed a college, of which the _curio maximus_ was the\r\npresident.[151]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say how far the religious organisation of the _curiae_\r\nwas a natural or artificial development. But artifice was certainly at\r\nwork in determining their important political character. The primitive\r\npopular assembly at Rome is the _comitia curiata_, composed wholly\r\nof Patricians. Here each member of a patrician clan above the legal\r\nage—probably the age of eighteen, at which military service commenced—had\r\nthe right of giving a single vote; a majority of the _curiales_ decided\r\nthe vote of the particular _curia_, and the decision of the assembly was\r\ndetermined by the majority of the groups.\r\n\r\nThey also had, in a secondary degree, an importance of a military kind;\r\nfor the supply of knights to the corps of _celeres_ is said to have been\r\neffected through the _curiae_.[152]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5. _The Monarchical Constitution_\r\n\r\nIt is generally agreed that the monarchical constitution of early Rome\r\nrested on a limited sovereignty of the people, a power restricted by\r\nthe extraordinary authority of their sole magistrate. This popular\r\nsovereignty was asserted in jurisdiction, in legislation, and in the\r\nratification of magisterial power. The attribution of the right of appeal\r\nin criminal cases (_provocatio_)[153] to the people shows that with them\r\nrests either the sovereign attribute of pardon or some right of trying\r\ncriminal cases in the last resort. Tradition makes the Roman people the\r\nsole source of law,[154] that is, of standing ordinances of a general\r\nkind which are to bind the community,[155] although the initiative in\r\nlegislation can come only from the king; and apart from the rulings of\r\nthe pontifical college, which did not require the sanction of the people,\r\nthis theory of primitive legislation seems to be correct; for the very\r\nearly laws passed by the _comitia_ on the downfall of the monarchy do\r\nnot appear to mark any violent break in the theory of the constitution.\r\nWe do not know whether the king employed the formula afterwards used\r\nby the Republican magistrates, which elicited the “will and command”\r\nof the burgesses (_velitis_, _jubeatis_, _quirites_); but law (_lex_)\r\nis from the first something “laid down” by a competent authority, and\r\nbinding, therefore, in virtue of the power that ordains it.[156] After\r\nits ordinance it may or must create a contractual relation between\r\nindividuals,[157] but there is no hint of its being the result of a\r\ncontract or co-operation between independent authorities. The source of\r\nlaw is, therefore, simple; it is the people’s will; but, through the bar\r\nto utterance created by the magistracy, this will is very limited in its\r\ncapacity for expression. The people are also affirmed to have been in a\r\ncertain sense the source of honour, and typical illustrations of this\r\npower are presented by the traditional beliefs that the regal _insignia_\r\nof Etruria, adopted by the kings of Rome, were only assumed by them\r\nwith the consent of Senate and people,[158] and that the appointment of\r\nofficers for special purposes, although these may have been in theory\r\nmerely delegates of the king, had to be ratified by laws of the _curiae_.\r\nThe quaestors, the earliest prototypes of the later magistrates at Rome,\r\nare said to have been so appointed.[159]\r\n\r\nThe people, therefore, possessed certain sovereign rights, but each right\r\nwas limited by the vast authority of their personal representative, who\r\nwielded the whole of the executive, and so much of the legislative power\r\nas is implied in the sole right of initiative. We cannot even speak of\r\nthe people as _vesting_ this power in their king; for their right of\r\nelection was, as we shall see, probably as limited as their power of\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nThis personal head possessed a variety of titles which marked the various\r\naspects of his rule—titles which survived into the Republic, and, on the\r\ndifferentiation of the functions which he united, were applied to various\r\nmagistrates. As supreme judge he was _judex_, as leader and commander\r\nin war _praetor_,[160] _dictator_, and _magister populi_.[161] The most\r\ngeneral title which marked him out as universal head of the state, in\r\nreligious as in civil matters, was that of _rex_, the “regulator” of all\r\nthings human and divine—a title which survived in the _rex sacrorum_, the\r\nheir of the king in sacrifice and in ritual. The powers on which this\r\nposition was based were summed up in the word _imperium_.[162]\r\n\r\nThe severance of the king from the state, over which he ruled, was also\r\nexpressed in certain outward signs (_insignia_), which distinguished him\r\nfrom the rest of the burgesses. He was preceded by twelve “summoners”\r\n(_lictores_),[163] each carrying a bundle of rods (_fasces_), and the\r\naxe-head gleamed from these bundles even within the walls, for the\r\nking’s military jurisdiction could be exercised within the city. His\r\nrobe was of “purple,” or rather of scarlet—the colour in which most\r\nnations have seen an emblem of sovereignty—but his dress probably varied\r\nwith the ritual which he was performing, and the three kinds of striped\r\ngarment (_trabea_) which survived in the Republic—that of purple for the\r\npriestly office, of purple and saffron for augury, of purple striped\r\nwith white for the _rex_[164]—were probably all vestments of the king.\r\nTradition also assigns him the eagle-headed sceptre, the golden crown,\r\nthe throne (_solium_),[165] and the chariot within the walls, from which\r\nthe curule chair (_sella curulis_) was believed to be derived.[166] The\r\nstatement that the triumphal _insignia_ of the Roman magistrate were\r\nbut the revival of the ordinary adornments of the king[167] is extremely\r\nprobable; for the crown, the _toga picta_ (a development of the purple\r\nrobe),[168] and the chariot reappear in the Roman triumph.\r\n\r\nOther royal prerogatives were connected with the primitive conception of\r\na patriarchal monarchy. The king, although he lacks the absolutism of\r\nthe _paterfamilias_, occupies much the same position in the state as the\r\nfather does in the family. In a sense he is owner of the whole community,\r\nand as such capable of commanding the _munera_ of the burgesses.[169]\r\nBut a large portion of the public domain was more peculiarly set apart\r\nfor his own private use.[170] This crown-land must have been worked\r\nmainly by the king’s own clients, who held it _precario_ from him;[171]\r\nfor there seems no reason to doubt the belief that a large proportion of\r\nthe half-free Plebeians were in the immediate _clientela_ of the king,\r\nconnected with the community chiefly through him, its representative.\r\nThese may have been captives who had submitted to the _fides_ of the\r\nstate, and whom their conqueror had not attached as dependants to other\r\nleading families of the community.\r\n\r\nThe theory of a kingship is best expressed in the mode in which the\r\nmonarch ascends the throne. The alternative principles that have usually\r\nbeen recognised are the hereditary, the elective, or that of divine right.\r\n\r\nOf the hereditary principle there is no trace at Rome. It is contradicted\r\nby the facts of the traditional history, which believed that, when the\r\nhereditary principle was first realised in the last king, the monarchy\r\ncame to an end; and it is expressly denied by later authors who reflected\r\non the character of the early monarchy.[172] There is rather more to\r\nbe said for the theory of divine right. Romulus is the son of a god\r\nand awaits the verdict of heaven before he assumes his rule. Numa, his\r\nsuccessor, insists that the same verdict shall be appealed to.[173] But,\r\nif the taking of the auspices be the sign of a divine origin, then\r\neverything in Rome proceeds almost equally from the gods. Probably in\r\nearlier as in later Rome religion played a most important subsidiary part\r\nin public life, but we have no warrant for believing that it was ever the\r\nsole guiding power. As we shall see, in discussing the question of the\r\ninauguration of the king, this theory raises into a primary and material\r\nwhat was merely a secondary and formal element in the transmission of the\r\nmonarchy, although this formal element was one of the utmost necessity\r\nand importance.\r\n\r\nThe Roman thinkers were thus thrown back on the theory of\r\nelection. Tradition is unanimous in representing the monarchy as\r\nelective—depending, i.e., on free popular election, or on such election\r\nguided by the Senate.[174] On the death of a king there is no immediate\r\nsuccessor with a title to rule; an interim-king (_interrex_) is appointed\r\nfor a few days, and on his proposal a king is elected by the patrician\r\nburgesses at the _comitia curiata_, subject to the sanction of the\r\npatrician Senate (_auctoritas patrum_).[175]\r\n\r\nIn the expression of these views the Roman thinkers were attempting to\r\nreconstruct the monarchy from a knowledge of their own magistracy; for\r\nthey rightly believed that this magistracy was a very slight modification\r\nof the original kingship. The elective principle of the Republic was not\r\nregarded as a novelty in the theory of the magistracy, and there were two\r\nreasons for this view. The first was that there was a real continuity,\r\nfor the elective process was always subsidiary to another, that of\r\nnomination by the magistrate who guided the elections. The latter became\r\nan almost formal process in the Republic, but the question was not asked\r\nwhether at one time it may not have been the material element. Secondly,\r\nthere was really an elective element in the monarchy, which survived as\r\na form into the Republic, a form which the hypothesis of monarchical\r\nelection adopted by Roman antiquarians could not explain. It is strange\r\nthat, in seeking for their theory of regal appointment, they should not\r\nhave appealed to the clearest survival of the monarchy, the dictatorship,\r\non which so much of the rest of their reconstruction of the monarchical\r\npower was based.\r\n\r\nIn the two definite survivals of the Roman monarchy election was not\r\nrecognised; the dictator was nominated by the consul, not by his\r\npredecessor, for it was only an occasional office; and the _rex sacrorum_\r\nwas nominated by the _pontifex maximus_,[176] no longer by the preceding\r\n_rex_; for this office simply continued the priestly functions of the\r\nking, the religious headship being vested in the _pontifex_. This oldest\r\nprinciple of appointment survived in Republican Rome as an integral part\r\nof the elective process, to reappear again in the Principate, in cases\r\nwhere election had become a mere form, as the living principle.[177] It\r\nis, in fact, the one principle that has a continuous history; election is\r\nthe Republican interlude.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, we are led to consider the monarchy as not purely an\r\nelective office, and substitute for election the principle of nomination,\r\nwe must consider that it was the right, and probably the duty, of\r\nthe king of Rome to nominate his successor. If there had been no due\r\nnomination during his lifetime, and consequently no distinctly marked\r\nout successor to the monarchy, the duty of providing such a successor\r\nlapsed to the Senate, from which body the _interrex_ was appointed.\r\nThe _interregnum_ is said by tradition to have dated from the first\r\nvacancy in the regal office, after the death of Romulus.[178] When such\r\na vacancy had occurred, the auspices, under which the state had been\r\nfounded, and which were the mark of divine acceptance of the kingly\r\nrule, “returned to the _patres_,”[179] and we are told that this was\r\nfrom the first interpreted to mean, not to the _comitia curiata_, but\r\nto the patrician Senate. The earliest _interregnum_ is represented as\r\nan exercise of collective rule by the Senate; but, on the analogy of\r\nthe sole magistracy, it took the form of a creation of a succession\r\nof _interreges_. The first step was the division of the Senate into\r\n_decuriae_;[180] each decury had fifty days of government allotted to\r\nit; within this period each individual member of the _decuria_ exercised\r\nrule for five days, and, according to one account, the succession of the\r\ndecuries was determined by lot (_sortitio_).[181] The rule is represented\r\nas collegiate, the whole decury possessing the _imperium_, while the\r\nindividual who ruled for five days had the _fasces_ and the external\r\nemblems of the royal power.[182] In later times we shall see that, though\r\nthe _interregnum_ was retained, the whole procedure was simplified by\r\nthe abandonment of the collegiate principle. If it ever existed, we must\r\nsuppose that, as soon as ever the resolution of the Senate was taken, the\r\ncollective rule could be interrupted by any _interrex_, except the first,\r\nnominating the king.[183] The _interregnum_, although represented by our\r\nauthorities as an invariable part of the procedure in the appointment of\r\na king, was probably from the first a makeshift, only resorted to when\r\nthe ordinary procedure had been interrupted through unforeseen causes,\r\nand there was no definitely designated successor.[184]\r\n\r\nYet, though the monarchy was not strictly elective, certain\r\nquasi-elective processes were connected by tradition with the appointment\r\nof the king, on the part both of Senate and people.\r\n\r\nThe authority of the Senate (_auctoritas patrum_) is mentioned in\r\nconnexion with all the transmissions of the supreme office.[185] It is an\r\nauthority, however, which did not spring from any theory of the Senate’s\r\npossessing elective powers, but was simply a result of the universal\r\nprinciple that no man in authority should act without taking advice\r\nof his _consilium_, and was merely an outcome of the constitutional\r\nnecessity which the king was under of consulting the Senate on all great\r\nmeasures affecting the popular welfare. The greatest of these would be\r\nthe appointment of a successor.\r\n\r\nSecondly, we are told of a formal ratification of the king’s power by the\r\npeople assembled in the _comitia curiata_, one which continued into the\r\nRepublic under the title of the _lex curiata_, a formal sanction always\r\nrequired for the ratification of an _imperium_ already assumed.[186] It\r\nis said to have had this character even in the time of the monarchy, and\r\nthis was thought to be shown by the fact that the king himself proposed\r\nthe _lex curiata_ which was to give the sanction for the exercise of\r\nhis own power.[187] Such procedure was, indeed, necessary, since no\r\none but the king had the right of putting the question to the people;\r\nconsequently we must accept the view that the _lex curiata_ was not\r\nabsolutely necessary for the exercise of power, and might be legally,\r\nthough not perhaps constitutionally, withheld, as it was by King Servius\r\nduring the early part of his reign.[188]\r\n\r\nThe Roman jurists, who believed that the king was elected, credited\r\nthe people with two distinct acts in the creation of a king—first, his\r\nelection, and then the formal ratification of this election.[189] A\r\nparallel for this seemed to be furnished by Republican usage, where the\r\n_lex_ was taken by magistrates already elected as a necessary preliminary\r\nto the exercise of the _imperium_. But at this period the magistrates\r\nwere not elected by the _comitia curiata_, and the _lex_ of this assembly\r\nis a mere survival, a reminiscence of the formal sovereignty which\r\ncontinued to be vested in the _curiae_. The _lex curiata_ is much more\r\ncomprehensible in origin if the king was first nominated independently of\r\nthe people and then challenged their allegiance. It was probably little\r\nmore than an acclamation on the first summons of the _curiae_ by the\r\nking. The preceding king must have already made known to the people his\r\nchoice of a successor, and the popular sentiment would have been already\r\nexpressed; thus there was little chance of adverse shouts when the new\r\nking challenged the allegiance of his burgesses. If there was a chance\r\nof the challenge not being accepted, it might, as we saw, be withheld.\r\nBut an exercise of the regal _imperium_ which was not sanctioned by these\r\ntwo acts of Senate and people—the expressed will of the one and the\r\ndeclared allegiance of the other—was regarded by later authorities as\r\nunconstitutional.[190]\r\n\r\nThere was also a religious aspect of the king’s appointment. His\r\nassumption of power was regarded as incomplete until it had been shown\r\nthat the gods sanctioned the rule which he had assumed. This was done by\r\nthe first taking of the auspices[191]—a ceremony observed by magistrates\r\nof the Republic before entering on the exercise of their office. This was\r\nthe final test for the right to exercise secular power; but the king’s\r\nposition as high-priest of the community was supposed to require another\r\ninitiatory act.\r\n\r\nThis was the inauguration, which differed from the taking of the\r\nauspices. In the ordinary form of the _auspicia_ the individual entering\r\non office has himself the right of _spectio_;[192] in the Republic it\r\nbelonged to magistrates as such, and was never regarded as a merely\r\npriestly function. In the special inauguration, on the contrary, the\r\n_spectio_ is taken by some other than the person inaugurated. The\r\npriest-king Numa is naturally associated with this ceremony by tradition;\r\nby him an appointed augur is employed to watch for signs,[193] and this\r\nceremony of inauguration by one of the priesthood, other than the person\r\nso inaugurated, is represented as being from this time onwards a standing\r\npart of the procedure requisite for entrance on the regal office. But\r\nthis legend of Numa is rendered somewhat incredible by the fact that the\r\naugurs have no right of _spectio_, and that of all the priests of the\r\nRepublic it is only the semi-magisterial _pontifex maximus_, the head of\r\nthe state religion, who has the right of taking auspices. The fact that\r\nthe _rex sacrorum_ in the Republic had a special inauguration[194] might\r\nlend support to the legend, were it not that this _rex_ had become wholly\r\na priest and thus lost his right of intercourse with the gods through\r\nthe _spectio_. The question of the inauguration of the king, unimportant\r\nin itself, runs up into two wider questions; the first is whether there\r\nwas a separation in idea between the king’s magisterial and his priestly\r\nfunctions; the second, whether the king was himself _pontifex maximus_\r\nand thus the supreme head of the Roman religion.\r\n\r\nFor an answer to the first question it is not safe to appeal to later\r\nexamples, for the priesthood and the magistracy may have been first\r\nsundered during the Republic. But tradition[195] and survivals represent\r\nthe king as the _first priest_ in the community. His successor, the\r\n_rex sacrorum_, ranks, as a priest, above the three great _flamines_\r\nand the _pontifex maximus_ in the order of the priesthood (_ordo\r\nsacerdotum_);[196] the religious duties of this _rex_ point to the fact\r\nthat the king’s functions were a regular _cultus_, not the occasional\r\nreligious duties of a Roman magistrate,[197] while his wife, the _regina\r\nsacrorum_, had her own simultaneous sacrifices.[198]\r\n\r\nBut the position of first priest did not in the Republic imply the\r\nheadship of the Roman religion; the chief pontiff, who is its head,\r\ncomes, as we saw, low in the order of the priesthood. The importance of\r\n_cultus_ and of religious authority springing from higher knowledge are\r\nnot the same. The pontiffs are only secondarily a priestly, primarily\r\nthey are a religious order, whose position is based on the knowledge\r\nof religious law (_fas_). The separation between the true priesthood\r\nand the presidency of religion may, indeed, have been a Republican\r\ndevelopment, due to the secularisation of the magistracy; the priestly\r\nfunctions of the magistrate being continued in the _rex sacrorum_, and\r\nthe religious presidency being also separated from the civil power,\r\nbut vested in another official, the chief pontiff. But it is possible\r\nthat the separation may have been primitive, and that _cultus_ and the\r\nknowledge of religious law did not go together. It is evident that\r\ngreat uncertainty prevailed as to the king’s relation to the pontifical\r\ncollege. While one account speaks of Numa selecting Numa Marcius as\r\n“_the_ pontiff,”[199] another describes the same king as instituting five\r\npontiffs,[200] and we are further told that, before the _lex Ogulnia_\r\n(300 B.C.), the college consisted of four members.[201] The discrepancy\r\nbetween the two last accounts has been reconciled by supposing that\r\nthe king himself was reckoned as a member of the college, and that the\r\nexpulsion of the king reduced the number from five to four.[202] It is\r\npossible that the king did not bear the title _pontifex maximus_ and was\r\nyet head of the college; it is even possible that, as one account which\r\nwe have quoted seems to indicate,[203] there was a chief pontiff as his\r\ndelegate. We can hardly refuse him a place at this board in face of the\r\nevidences which point to his universal headship of religion. The creation\r\nof the augurate and the priesthoods is his work. Romulus appoints the\r\naugurs;[204] Numa institutes the three great Flamines, the Salii, and\r\nthe Pontifex, although most of the important ceremonies of religion are\r\nperformed by himself personally.[205] Consequently we may conclude that\r\nthe appointment of special individuals to these priesthoods must have\r\nbeen a part of the king’s office.[206] It has even been held (chiefly\r\nas an inference from the fact that the Vestals and Flamens were in the\r\n_potestas_ of the _pontifex maximus_ of the Republic) that the former\r\nwere the king’s unmarried daughters who attended to the sacred fire of\r\nthe state in the king’s house, the latter his sons whose duty it was\r\nto kindle the fire for the sacrificial worship of particular deities,\r\nJupiter, Mars, and Quirinus. This pleasing picture may have represented\r\nthe primitive state of the patriarchal kingship; but this had been\r\nlong outgrown before the close of the monarchy. There we find a fully\r\ndeveloped hierarchy and the existence of religious guilds, such as those\r\nof pontiffs and augurs, who cultivate the science, not the mere ritual of\r\nreligion, and who have no possible connexion with the king’s household\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\nAt the head of this imposing organisation stands the _rex_, and, in\r\nvirtue of this position, he is the chief expounder of the rules of divine\r\nlaw (_fas_). It is a law which has hardly any limits, running parallel\r\nwith civil justice (_jus_) but far beyond its bounds. Three methods of\r\nits operation may conveniently be distinguished. One is purely religious\r\nand ritualistic and is expressed in the control of priesthoods, religious\r\ncolleges, and cults. The second asserts itself in a control over the life\r\nof the ordinary citizen in matters criminal and civil. The third is that\r\nwhich connects the Roman state with other independent communities and\r\nforms the international law of the period.\r\n\r\n(i.) The control over priesthood and _cultus_ belongs to the history\r\nof religion rather than to that of constitutional law, and it chiefly\r\npresents a legal aspect in connexion with the question of religious\r\njurisdiction. The difficult questions that arose in Republican times\r\nfrom the clashing of the religious and the civil power could hardly have\r\nbeen heard of as yet, for the supreme control of both was vested in the\r\nsame man. But the very nature of this disciplinary jurisdiction over\r\npriests has been a matter of some dispute. The favourite hypothesis of\r\na family jurisdiction has been applied to the case, and the hypothesis\r\nmay conceivably be correct so far as the Flamens and the Vestals are\r\nconcerned, although even in this sphere it is doubtful by what paternal\r\nright the head of religion could do the Vestal’s paramour to death. Other\r\nphases of the power are still more inexplicable on this ground. A right\r\nof punishing augurs for a breach of ritualistic rules survived into the\r\nRepublic, and seems to be a jurisdiction exercised over them as members\r\nof a religious body. There is, however, no trace of the priesthood\r\nholding a privileged position, and in all secular matters its members\r\nare subject to the ordinary law. Such privileges as they possess rest on\r\nreligious scruples. When the Flamen was caught (_captus_) for the god, he\r\nbecame free from the paternal power,[207] and the civil authority could\r\nnot compel him to take an oath.[208] The persons of the Vestals were\r\ninviolable;[209] the sanctity of both Flamens and Vestals also invested\r\nthem with the right of _asylum_. The bonds were struck off the prisoner\r\nwho took refuge in the Flamen’s house; and, if the criminal on the way to\r\npunishment met him or the Vestal, he could not be scourged or executed\r\non that day. But it is only in these two cases that the severance from\r\nthe world is strongly marked; we have no reason for believing that, in\r\nthe earliest period of Rome’s history, the members of the religious\r\norders were isolated from the mass of the people with privileges and a\r\njurisdiction all their own.\r\n\r\nThe control of the _cultus_, and the maintenance of its purity, are\r\nmarked as one of the earliest duties of the _pontifex maximus_, and must\r\nhave belonged to the king. It is he that sees that no ancestral right is\r\nneglected, no foreign one acquired.[210] Here we have a religious power\r\nthat governs more than the priesthood; the maintenance of the _sacra\r\nprivata_ are as important in its eyes as that of the _sacra publica_, and\r\nits supervision must have extended beyond the limits of the Patriciate;\r\nfor it is impossible to believe that religion cared only for the _sacra_\r\nof the patrician clans, and aimed only at preventing them from corrupting\r\ntheir ancestral worship. The Plebeian and the client were under the\r\nprotection of the gods, and might bring down a curse on the community by\r\nreckless innovation or neglect.\r\n\r\n(ii.) The control exercised by _fas_ over the citizens’ life in\r\nmatters not immediately connected with ritual and worship may be first\r\nillustrated by its penal sanctions. We cannot, indeed, say that there was\r\na time when the Roman law regarded every crime as a sin, for from the\r\nvery first we are confronted with a dualism, and religious and secular\r\nsanctions exist side by side. But religion has left a deeper impress\r\nhere than elsewhere—in the name given to punishment,[211] in the form of\r\nits infliction, in the still stranger fact that, by the disappearance of\r\nreligious sanctions, breaches of obligation that the modern world regards\r\nas crimes remained unpunished by the secular arm.\r\n\r\nThe punishment for sin must be some form of expiation. This is the\r\n_piaculum_ adjudged in the monarchy as in Republican times by the head\r\nof religion; and not adjudged arbitrarily, for even by the close of\r\nthe monarchical period classes of offences had doubtless been drawn up\r\nby the pontiffs with the equivalent expiation, which was directed to\r\navert the anger of the gods from the whole community. Apart from the\r\nregularly recurring lustrations at the census—the consequence of the\r\nsense of universal sinfulness in the community—individual misdeeds could\r\nbe expiated in this way. Such was a murder that was unintentional or\r\nin which mitigating circumstances were present,[212] and such was the\r\nviolation of the chastity of Juno’s person through the touching of\r\nher altar by a _paelex_.[213] In graver cases expiation could only be\r\naccepted where there was no intent,[214] as in the wrong done to a god\r\nby swearing falsely in his name.[215] There was also a class of deadly\r\nsins for which the gods would accept no atonement but the life and the\r\ngoods of the sinner himself. Amongst the acts which called forth this\r\n_consecratio capitis_ were the violation of the relations of client and\r\npatron,[216] the ill-treatment of elders by their children,[217] the\r\npulling up or alteration of boundary stones,[218] the destruction of a\r\nneighbour’s corn by night.[219] The god thus appeased was often the deity\r\nwho was held to be specially offended by the act; but sometimes the head\r\nand the goods were not dedicated to the same divinities. The person was\r\nadjudged to Jupiter, the dispenser of life; the landed property to the\r\ngods who nourish the human race, Ceres and Liber.[220] This custom of\r\nconsecration gradually ceased to have its literal fulfilment. A man might\r\nstill be declared _sacer_, but excommunication had taken the place of\r\nimmolation. Such a man was cut off from all divine and, therefore, from\r\nall human help, and his slayer was blood-guiltless.[221] This theory, of\r\na man being cut off from the community while his life was spared, became\r\nof great importance in the history of Roman criminal law. It survived in\r\nthe “interdiction of fire and water” (_aquae et ignis interdictio_), and\r\nfamiliarised the Romans with the idea that the severest penalty did not\r\nrequire the sacrifice of life.\r\n\r\nIn matters of private law we have already witnessed the presence of\r\nreligion in marriage, adoption, testament, and the transmission of the\r\n_sacra_. Its authority may be further illustrated by the formularies\r\nof civil procedure. Here the form of words was all-important, and in\r\nthe early Republic all binding _formulae_, whether for oaths that were\r\nto be effectual, for vows or for consecration, were known only to the\r\npontiffs. The solemn forms of law (_legis actiones_) issued from the\r\nsame authority, and in one of their most frequent manifestations, the\r\n_sacramentum_, the procedure was distinctly religious.[222] But who could\r\nsay whether the king, when he gave the prescribed form of words for an\r\naction, acted as a religious or a civil head, as the representative of\r\n_fas_ or _jus_? Here we are on the borderland between the two.\r\n\r\n(iii.) Nations know no common _jus_, and _fas_ is the sole support of\r\ninternational law. Each people is protected by its own divine guardians;\r\nhence a war of two nations is a contest between their gods, and a treaty\r\nbetween two peoples a compact between their respective divinities. But\r\neach nation is to some extent under the protection of the other’s gods.\r\nJupiter of Rome is powerless if the war commenced by Rome is unjust, and\r\nwill punish his own people if they have stained his honour by violating a\r\ntreaty. Even though there is no belief in community of guardianship, the\r\nrights of other peoples are still conceived to be under the protection of\r\nthe Roman gods.\r\n\r\nThese beliefs necessitated elaborate religious preliminaries to the\r\ndeclaration of a war in order that it might be just and holy (_justum\r\npiumque_),[223] as well as ceremonies for the conclusion of a peace that\r\nwas to bind the public conscience (_fides publica_).[224] Such a ritual\r\nmay have been performed, originally, by the king himself; but tradition\r\nstates that, at a very early period, a special guild of priests, the\r\nFetiales or public orators, were appointed for this purpose.[225] Their\r\nchief functions were the declaration of war and the conclusion of peace,\r\nbut the ritual observed in both of these acts may be more appropriately\r\ndescribed when we are dealing with the international relations of Rome.\r\nThere were other religious preliminaries to a war which, though not\r\nnecessitated by divine law, it was highly expedient to observe, in order\r\nto increase the chances of victory. Vows (_vota_) were offered to the\r\nnative gods, and for these to be valid they must be couched in a form\r\nprescribed by the pontifical college.[226] And sometimes the king, before\r\na battle or a siege, chants an incantation (_carmen_), the purport of\r\nwhich is to weaken the loyalty of the enemies’ gods to their worshippers,\r\nand to bring them over to the side of Rome. He bribes them with temples,\r\nofferings, and the honours of a special cult.[227] If the bribery is\r\neffective and the city falls, he must carry out his pledge. The conquered\r\ngods are received at Rome; and their worship is guaranteed by the\r\ndistribution of their cults over the patrician clans.[228] The instances\r\npreserved of this _devotio_ and _evocatio_ naturally date from the time\r\nof the Republic.[229] During this period the forms are prescribed by the\r\npontiffs. But the antiquity of the procedure is beyond question. The\r\nresults of evocation on the part of the king, who was his own pontiff,\r\nare manifested in the local worships of the conquered towns of Latium,\r\nwhich found an early home at Rome.\r\n\r\nIf we turn from the religious to the civil powers of the king, it is\r\neasier to estimate their extent than to determine the precise modes\r\nof their exercise. Later belief credited him with the sole executive\r\npower of the state. The Roman kings possessed πᾶσα ἀρχή, and exercised\r\nthe _imperium_ at their own discretion.[230] Such statements are not\r\nsurprising if we remember what is implied in the _imperium_, and that\r\nthere appear to have been no legal limitations to its exercise during\r\nthe monarchy. _Imperium_ implied the combination of the highest military\r\nand civil authority; it united jurisdiction with command in war, and\r\nit included the further right of intercourse with the people (_jus\r\nrogandi_); while the later restrictions on this power, the limitation of\r\noffice by time or by colleagueship, had not yet been created. The king\r\nheld office for life, and he had no colleague; for the other officials in\r\nthe state must have been mere delegates whom, in the strict theory of the\r\nconstitution, he permitted to exist.\r\n\r\nBut if the king’s power was legally free from restraint, and we do not\r\nbelieve that there was any large body of _leges_ binding his authority,\r\nit could not have been free from the limitations imposed by custom and\r\nconstitutional usage. Customary law securing rights for the people\r\nis said to have been raised to the level of positive law by Servius\r\nTullius.[231] But even the earlier usages must have formed a kind of\r\ncode—such a code as that which contained the pontifical ordinances\r\nknown as the _leges regiae_.[232] It was the belief in the existence\r\nof this early customary law which led to the later description of the\r\nking’s power as an _imperium legitimum_.[233] Amongst his constitutional\r\nobligations was that of consulting the Senate in any important matter.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that the original council of elders (_senatus_)\r\nwas a body of nominees selected by the king as his permanent advising\r\nbody (_consilium publicum_).[234] In consequence the position of senator\r\ncould not have been a life-office; there could neither have been any\r\ndefinite mode of attaining the dignity, nor any claim on the part of\r\nan individual to retain it. A new king might decline to summon some\r\nof his predecessor’s councillors; he might even, perhaps, change the\r\n_personnel_ of his advisers during the course of his reign. It was in\r\nlater times believed that the freedom of selection was so great that no\r\nstigma attached to members who were “passed over” (_praeteriti_) by the\r\nking.[235]\r\n\r\nYet tradition attributes a definiteness to the Senate which is not\r\nconsistent with the idea of a purely arbitrary selection. Its numbers at\r\nany given time are fixed, and it is to some extent made representative\r\nof the whole patrician community—for an increase in the number of full\r\nburgesses involved a corresponding increase in the numbers of this\r\nbody.[236] The number, originally 100,[237] was raised by successive\r\nsteps to 300 before the close of the monarchy.[238] The two obvious units\r\nof representation were the _curiae_ and the clans; but the latter, from\r\ntheir larger numbers, formed a better basis for reflecting the opinion of\r\nthe whole community, and tradition does seem to have imposed a kind of\r\nconstitutional necessity on the king of distributing his councillors as\r\nevenly as possible amongst the patrician _gentes_.[239] It was thus that\r\nthe distinction between the older and the newer clans was perpetuated\r\nin the procedure of the Senate;[240] but the clan-influence left its\r\nstrongest mark by giving a name to the members of the body itself. It was\r\nthe leading heads of families (_patres familias seniores_) that the king\r\nsummoned; and, in asking their advice, he addressed them as “heads of\r\nhouses” (_patres_).\r\n\r\nThe primitive Senate is credited with two standing powers—the _patrum\r\nauctoritas_ and the initiation of an _interregnum_. Neither of these\r\nprerogatives was directly contemplated by the constitution, and the\r\nSenate never becomes a corporation possessing powers in its own right\r\nuntil the time of the Empire. Tradition mentions the “authority of the\r\nfathers” as being necessary for the appointment of a new king; it leaves\r\nit to be inferred that it was required for the validity of laws as well,\r\nan inference probably not true of the period of the monarchy. As we\r\nhave already explained, it was a legal right only in so far as it was\r\nan extreme instance of the necessity the magistrate was under of taking\r\nadvice. Perhaps towards the close of the monarchy, with reference to\r\nthe choice of a successor to the throne, custom had made it a standing\r\nprerogative. The _interregnum_ rests on a somewhat different basis; it\r\nwas a power which religion enjoined should be in the hands of the whole\r\npatrician community—usage had delegated the power to the patrician\r\nSenate; so here again we have a prerogative which rested wholly on custom.\r\n\r\nA privilege only less constant than these was probably the control of\r\nforeign policy. The formula of the Fetiales, which is said to have dated\r\nfrom their institution during the monarchy, contains the clause: “But\r\non these matters we will consult the elders at home, how we may obtain\r\nour rights.”[241] It was thus the duty of the king to consult the Senate\r\nin all matters affecting the international relations of the state. For\r\na declaration of war, perhaps, even this was not sufficient. Tradition\r\nbelieved that, in this matter, reference must be made to the people\r\nassembled in the _comitia curiata_.[242]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the right of making treaties (_foedera_) with states\r\ncould not have been limited in this way. For the treaty made in time of\r\npeace the Senate, and perhaps the people, were consulted; but this could\r\nhardly have been the case with the treaty which closed a war and which\r\nwas made on the field of battle. In the Republic there survives a shadowy\r\nand disputed right of the _imperator_ in the field to make a treaty which\r\nshall bind the people. The right was denied, but only on the ground that\r\nthe general could not take an oath binding on the public conscience. But\r\nthe king was at once general and high-priest; he could doubtless take\r\nthis oath even without the assistance of his servants, the Fetiales.\r\n\r\nThere were other manifestations of the king’s power as general over which\r\nthe people would have no control. The disposal of the booty taken in\r\nwar and of the conquered lands was one of these,[243] and the statements\r\nwhich record this right find support in Republican survivals. The control\r\nof the spoils of war (at least of the movable portions) belongs to the\r\nRepublican general, subject to the advice of his council of war and\r\nsometimes to subsequent ratification by the Senate. The first condition\r\nmay have been necessary in the time of the monarchy, but hardly the\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nThe council of war was a type of the smaller special _consilia_, which\r\nthe king doubtless employed to advise him in different branches of the\r\nadministration; and such special councils must have been chosen from\r\nthe great _consilium publicum_, the Senate. One of the most important\r\nof these was that which furnished his assessors in jurisdiction. That\r\nit became the custom, in the more important cases judged by the king in\r\nperson, to employ a _consilium_ of some sort, is stated in the charge\r\nbrought by tradition against Tarquinius Superbus that he neglected\r\nthis essential guarantee of even justice.[244] In the secular criminal\r\njurisdiction of the king such a council would doubtless have been taken\r\nfrom the Senate. In the religious jurisdiction, which we have considered,\r\nthe pontiffs would have been the advising board.\r\n\r\nSenators also must have been chiefly chosen as delegates of the king,\r\nexcept, perhaps, those appointed for subordinate command in war;[245]\r\nthere military fitness would be chiefly looked to.\r\n\r\nThe chief of these delegates was the prefect of the city (_praefectus\r\nurbi_), an _alter ego_ left behind in the capital by the king when he\r\nhimself was absent in the field.[246] To him must have been delegated\r\nthe whole of the executive power, and with it the right and duty of\r\nconsulting the Senate. It is not probable that the right of questioning\r\nthe people was or could be delegated.[247] In criminal jurisdiction a\r\ndistinction was believed to have been made in the cases brought before\r\nthe king; the more important were tried by himself in person, the less\r\nimportant transmitted to judges chosen from the Senate.[248] This may be\r\nthe germ of a distinction which is said to have been perfected by Servius\r\nTullius. Crimes affecting the public welfare he tried himself; wrongs\r\ndone to private individuals he entrusted to others.[249]\r\n\r\nThis principle of delegation is mentioned only in connexion with criminal\r\njurisdiction. But, whatever its extent, it necessitated the grant by\r\nthe magistrate to his delegate of a _formula_ or _lex_, which was the\r\nexpression of _jus_. This _jus_, “that which is right or fitting,”\r\nexpressed the order of society, as realised through human agency, not\r\ndirectly through the divine will.[250] It is possible that even in early\r\nRome it was treated as a right, a faculty of action (_facultas agendi_)\r\nor liberty enjoyed by one man against another, by individuals against\r\ncorporations or by corporations against individuals. The differentiation\r\nbetween the rights of the state and the rights of the individual, always\r\nmarked in procedure long before it is formulated in theory, finds\r\nexpression in the change which tradition attributes to Servius.[251] But\r\nthere was never any clear line of demarcation between the two spheres.\r\nMuch of what we call criminal law was at Rome a matter for civil actions\r\ndependent on private initiative, and such actions could in early times\r\nbe brought only by the head of the family. But in so far as the early\r\nRomans had a criminal law, in so far, that is, as an offence against the\r\nindividual could be regarded as a wrong done to society, this law was a\r\npart of the _jus publicum_.\r\n\r\nThe king was the sole exponent of this sense of violated right, and\r\nthe sole interpreter of the _jus_ fixed by custom or by law. Over the\r\npenalty he probably had little control. It was enjoined in his ruling\r\nand carried out by his lictors; but, in its various forms—death by\r\nthe _arbor infelix_ or from the Tarpeian rock—it was fixed by the _mos\r\nmajorum_. The trial was a personal investigation (_quaestio_) undertaken\r\nby the king, with the assistance of a chosen body of advisers; and he\r\nmight give judgment himself. But sometimes his judgment was conditioned.\r\nHe specified the crime under which the accused was to be tried, and\r\nthe penalty to be inflicted, but left the finding on the facts to his\r\ndelegates.[252] Two such classes of delegates are attributed to the regal\r\nperiod, the _duumviri perduellionis_ and the _quaestores parricidii_.[253]\r\n\r\nThere may have been an appeal from the delegates to the king, but\r\ntradition does not credit the king with any power of pardon. Whether\r\nthe power of pardon resided anywhere depends on our interpretation of\r\nthe trial of Horatius,[254] which was believed to furnish the archetype\r\nof the _provocatio_. From this story appears the belief, which is often\r\nstated by other authorities,[255] that the appeal to the people existed\r\nin the regal period, but one modified by the view that the citizens\r\nhad no standing right of appeal against the king such as that secured\r\nagainst the Republican magistrate by the _lex Valeria_. The king, Tullus\r\nHostilius, _allows_ the appeal.[256] The early dictatorship was similarly\r\nexempt from the necessity of permitting it, and on one occasion the\r\nprecedent of Horatius was appealed to for the purpose of showing that,\r\nas the king had allowed, so the dictator should allow, the appeal.[257]\r\nBut the dictatorship is a revival of the _military_ side of the monarchy\r\nwith the military jurisdiction which the king exercises over Horatius.\r\nIt is quite possible that before the close of the monarchy custom had\r\nestablished different spheres of criminal jurisdiction for the people and\r\nthe king respectively;[258] in some the people might have had a right\r\nto be judges in the last resort, and it is the idea of calling away a\r\ncase to another court that is suggested by the word _provocatio_, not\r\nthe modern idea of pardon.[259] In other spheres the king could judge\r\nalone; the _provocatio_ here is an act of grace. If, however, we consider\r\nthe extent of the military and religious jurisdiction of the king, the\r\ncompetence of the people must have been small;[260] and the _provocatio_\r\nitself may be a growth of the later monarchical period, the result of\r\ncustom, and of a custom based chiefly on the permit of the king.\r\n\r\nCivil jurisdiction is said to have been based on the king’s\r\njudgment.[261] How far this royal jurisdiction was personal we cannot\r\nsay, but under all circumstances the king was the chief source of\r\nthe _jus privatum_, in so far as he and his pontiffs alone knew the\r\nformularies of action,[262] the most precise verbal accuracy in which\r\nwas necessary for the successful conduct of a suit. It is probable that\r\nin many cases the king gave merely the formulary of action, that is,\r\nthe ruling in law, and then sent the case before a private judge or\r\narbitrator (_judex privatus, arbiter_), thus illustrating (although not,\r\nperhaps, on the scale recognised during the Republic) the fundamental\r\ndivision of judicial procedure into _jus_ and _judicium_. This division\r\nof jurisdiction is probably primitive and not, as has sometimes been\r\nthought, a modification introduced by the later monarchy.[263] Even in\r\nRepublican times the _judex_ was chosen by consent of the parties.[264]\r\nHe was an arbitrator between the litigants agreed to by a mutual\r\ncompact,[265] and an outcome of the notion of self-help so prominent in\r\nearly Greek and Roman law. But one who knows the forms of action has to\r\nstand by and see that the words of these forms are correctly repeated.\r\nThis depositary of _jus_ is the king or one of his pontiffs. Hence\r\neventually the public official comes to assist at the appointment of the\r\njudge. From this it is but a slight step to give the formula of action\r\nwhich settles the law of the case, and to leave it to the _judex_ to\r\ndecide the question of fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 6. _The Servian Constitution_\r\n\r\nAt some period before the close of the monarchy the absurdity of the\r\nexisting constitutional arrangements began to be felt. In matters of\r\nprivate law there was not a single important difference between a free\r\nPlebeian and a Patrician; and large numbers of that portion of the\r\nPlebs which had sprung from clientship were virtually in a condition of\r\nindependence. Although their tenure of the soil might be precarious,\r\ntheir right of acting for themselves in the law courts questionable, it\r\nmust have been practically impossible to avoid the appearance of full\r\nownership where the lord had not asserted his right for generations,\r\nor to prohibit the personal enforcement of claims where the original\r\npatronage had been long forgotten or had lapsed through the extinction of\r\nthe patrician family on which the original client had been dependent. It\r\nwas, in fact, impossible to say where the class of free Plebeians ended\r\nand that of protected Plebeians began. It was better, for the purposes\r\ncontemplated by the impending reform which bears the name of Servius\r\nTullius, that they should be regarded as on an equality, and that both\r\nclasses should make up a single order. The essence of this reform is,\r\nin fact, the recognition of _equality of rights in landed property_.\r\nOwnership of Roman land _ex jure quiritium_ was guaranteed to the whole\r\nplebeian order—probably even to those dependants and emancipated slaves\r\nwhose clientship, and therefore whose precarious tenure of the soil, was\r\npatent;[266] and with respect to the rights of _commercium_ the order was\r\nput on a level with the Patriciate.\r\n\r\nSo far the object of the reform seems to be to confer privileges on\r\ncertain classes of the Plebeians. Its real meaning was wholly different.\r\nThe intention of the reformer—one which explains the readiness with\r\nwhich the change seems to have been accepted by the Patricians[267]—was\r\nto impose burdens on the whole plebeian community. A recognition of the\r\nrights of property was a necessary preliminary to the imposition of\r\ntaxation and of the full quota of military service. The _patres_, who\r\nwelcomed this distribution of burdens, did not foresee that from these\r\nobligations would flow a fresh series of rights which would impair their\r\nmonopoly of political power.\r\n\r\nThe Plebeians were being recognised for the first time as, in a sense,\r\nmembers of the state. The first problem was the choice of a medium\r\nthrough which they should be incorporated in it; for simple membership\r\nof a state which was not based on membership of some lower unit was\r\ninconceivable to the Graeco-Roman world. Many of the Plebeians had no\r\nclans; they could not, therefore, be made members of the three primitive\r\ntribes,[268] and when the change was first mooted, it was, probably\r\nfor the same reason, thought impossible to make them members of the\r\n_curiae_.[269] New tribes must be invented which should include the\r\nwhole community. The chief burden of taxation, now imposed equally on\r\nall classes, was to lie on land. What more natural than that the tribes\r\nshould be territorial divisions, so defined as to include all the\r\nterritory held in ownership by the Roman people? It is established that\r\nthe tribes, which are specially described as local,[270] contained only\r\nthat land which was subject to quiritarian ownership,[271] and from this\r\nfact the deduction has been drawn that all land subject to quiritarian\r\nownership was included in the tribes. As the Servian tribes were believed\r\nonly to have comprised the city itself, as enclosed by the Servian\r\nwalls,[272] this view leads to the startling conclusion that no land\r\nwas held in private ownership outside the city, as its limits were fixed\r\nby Servius—that the land outside, so far as it was not _ager publicus_,\r\nwas held by some larger corporation such as the _gens_.[273] But such a\r\nconclusion is most improbable; it was the evolution of private ownership\r\nwhich had created the rich Plebeian, who had often no clan and could not\r\nhold in common with others, and such a holder was the least likely man in\r\nthe world to have land in or near the city, even as its limits were fixed\r\nby Servius.\r\n\r\nConsequently if, as seems to have been the case, the tribes did include\r\nall landowners, they must have extended far beyond the bounds of the\r\ncity. Our authorities knew them at a time when their names indeed\r\nsurvived, but when they had become strictly divisions of the city, by the\r\ncomplete separation of the country from the urban tribes. If we believe\r\nin the urban character of the four original _tribus_, we must accept the\r\nclearly expressed but generally discredited belief preserved by Dionysius\r\nthat besides these four tribes, which comprehended only the city, Servius\r\nestablished twenty-six others which took in the country districts.[274]\r\n\r\nThe view that the four tribes[275] comprised the country districts is\r\npreferable, and is not incompatible with the fact that they certainly\r\ndesignated parts of the city, nor even with the possibility of their\r\nhaving been engrafted in some way on the older divisions of the _Ramnes_,\r\n_Tities_, and _Luceres_.[276] Local creations of an artificial character,\r\nindependent of juxtaposition, are not unknown in early legislations;\r\nthey are found in the almost contemporary work of Cleisthenes of Athens.\r\nBut even this hypothesis is unnecessary; each tribe may have stretched\r\ncontinuously with fairly definite boundaries beyond the city walls. The\r\ncountry portions of these tribes were for a moment wholly lost by the\r\ndisastrous wars which followed the expulsion of the kings, and when the\r\n_ager Romanus_ was again regained, a new organisation was adopted The\r\nterritory outside the walls was parcelled out into country tribes,[277]\r\nand these grew in number as Rome’s conquests spread. The four Servian\r\ntribe-names were kept as designations only of regions within the city.\r\n\r\nAlthough the tribes were divisions of the land, and individuals were\r\nregistered in that tribe in which their land-allotment lay,[278] there is\r\nno good reason for accepting the current belief that the landless citizen\r\nwas not enrolled in a tribe.[279] It has generally been assumed that the\r\nonly object of the Servian tribes was to furnish a system of registration\r\nfor taxation and the military levy. If this was the case, and we believe\r\nthat these burdens were imposed only on landed property, it follows as a\r\nconsequence that only holders of land were _tribules_. But there is no\r\nevidence that their scope was so limited. They appear to be divisions of\r\nthe _populus Romanus_, and the disinherited or ruined Patrician who has\r\nlost his land is still a member of that _populus_. The tribe to which\r\na landless man belonged would depend upon his domicile; it is a man’s\r\nlocal position in a tribe, not the land he holds in it, which is given\r\nas a criterion of his membership and of the political rights which it\r\nsubsequently conferred.[280]\r\n\r\nThe system of registration, which was the central idea of the Servian\r\nreforms, was essentially military. It recognised only those persons\r\nwho were qualified for service by wealth, regarded them as forming an\r\narmy (_exercitus_), and divided this army into its two branches of\r\ninfantry and cavalry. This military organisation recognised one primary\r\nand two secondary principles as the basis of classification; the first\r\nwas wealth, the second age, the third took the form of a subdivision\r\nfor strategic purposes, the military unit employed being the “hundred”\r\n(_centuria_).\r\n\r\nFor the moment we may overlook the cavalry and fix our attention on the\r\nbulk of the citizens who form the infantry. These are split up into five\r\ndivisions, which were at a later period called _classes_. The basis of\r\ndivision was wealth, and the crucial question is “what kind of wealth?”\r\nIt is almost certain that it could not have been wealth reckoned in\r\nmoney. Although Rome was a seaport and a trading state, it is doubtful\r\nwhether even the old libral _as_, which was used as a medium of exchange\r\nby weight, was in current use at this time;[281] and therefore the\r\ndetailed accounts given of the money valuations by which the classes were\r\nfixed must refer to a later period in the history of this organisation.\r\nThe alternative that has been suggested is land.[282] There would be\r\nno difficulty in accepting this substitute, paralleled as it is by the\r\nsimilar organisation of Solon, were it not that the hypothesis ignores\r\nsources of wealth which the earliest Roman law seems to have classed\r\nwith land, i.e. slaves and domesticated beasts. These _res mancipi_ are\r\nas much the object of quiritarian ownership as land, and they may exist\r\nwithout it. A man might own no land and yet be rich in cattle and sheep\r\nwhich he drove on the _ager publicus_, or in slaves engaged in productive\r\nhandicrafts,[283] and the state was interested in all that was duly owned\r\nand was properly the subject of assessment (_res censui censendo_);[284]\r\nthe Servian census must have been based on _res mancipi_, and to a\r\ncertain degree it was a census based on currency, for cattle (_pecus_)\r\nwere recognised as a medium of exchange (_pecunia_).\r\n\r\nOn the basis of such a census five classes were distinguished; the census\r\nof each, in terms of the later assessment, which was probably expressed\r\nin _asses sextantarii_, being respectively 100,000, 75,000, 50,000,\r\n25,000, 11,000 asses.\r\n\r\nEach of these divisions was subdivided into two with reference to\r\nage, the _juniores_ (from eighteen to forty-five) being the effective\r\nfighting force, the _seniores_ (forty-five to sixty) the home defence.\r\nThe final division is into the military unit, the century (_centuria_),\r\nconsisting nominally of a hundred men. This was the minimum strength of\r\nthe lowest unit, but the census list did not represent the effective\r\nfighting force of the legion organised for battle, but the numbers\r\nqualified for service; consequently the centuries of a particular\r\nclass were raised to the quota required to include all the members of\r\nthat class. The numerical proportion of the centuries of the different\r\nclasses to one another is very striking. The centuries of the first class\r\n(eighty in number) are almost equal to those of the four other classes\r\nput together (collectively ninety in number). If this table exhibits\r\nthe real proportion of social classes to one another, it would show a\r\nwonderfully equal distribution of land in the state, one so equal as to\r\ncause most of the landholders to be placed in the same class, for the\r\nlist would mainly represent holders of land (the other _res mancipi_\r\nnot being usually divorced from its possession). But the proportions of\r\nthe classes may only show that the centuries of richer citizens were\r\nstill regarded as forming the more permanent force, the other divisions,\r\nnot much more numerous though drawn from a larger population, being\r\nmerely supplementary. We know that members of the first class were more\r\nperfectly equipped,[285] and the fact of their being the main strength\r\nof the army would be proved if it were true that this class alone was\r\noriginally _classis_ (“the line”) and that all the others were _infra\r\nclassem_.[286]\r\n\r\nAs will be seen from the accompanying table of the census, the mass of\r\ncitizens whose property fell below that of the lowest class was not\r\nwholly unprovided for. They were organised, according to Livy, into six,\r\naccording to Dionysius into five, centuries. Some of these were composed\r\nof professional persons, whose services were indispensable to an army,\r\nand who were, perhaps, members of the trade guilds (_collegia_) which are\r\nsaid to have existed in the regal period.[287] Such were the carpenters\r\n(_fabri_) who formed two centuries, and the horn-blowers and trumpeters\r\n(_cornicines_ and _tibicines_) who formed one each.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SERVIAN CLASSIFICATION\r\n\r\nTHE CAVALRY\r\n\r\n18 centuries, with no fixed property qualification.\r\n\r\nTHE INFANTRY\r\n\r\n  _1st Classis_—100,000 asses (Livy and Dionysius),[288] 120,000\r\n       asses (Pliny and Festus).[289]\r\n         Seniores, 40 cent. } 80\r\n         Juniores, 40 cent. }\r\n\r\n  _2nd Classis_—75,000 asses (Liv. and Dionys.).\r\n         Seniores, 10 cent. } 20\r\n         Juniores, 10 cent. }\r\n\r\n  _3rd Classis_—50,000 asses (Liv. and Dionys.).\r\n         Seniores, 10 cent. } 20\r\n         Juniores, 10 cent. }\r\n\r\n  _4th Classis_—25,000 asses.\r\n         Seniores, 10 cent. } 20\r\n         Juniores, 10 cent. }\r\n\r\n  _5th Classis_—11,000 asses (Liv.), 12,500 (Dionys. 12½ minae).\r\n         Seniores, 15 cent. } 30\r\n         Juniores, 15 cent. }\r\n       _Fabri_—2 cent.

These were\r\nmen with no heavy armour, who might be enrolled as occasion required\r\n(_adscripticii_), or who marched to battle as light-armed troops ready at\r\nany moment to take the armour and places of the fallen legionaries.[292]\r\nNo property qualification was required for these three groups, the\r\nreason being that their place in the army did not demand it. But to\r\nthese Livy and Dionysius add another unpropertied class, the century of\r\n_proletarii_, which included the whole mass of the people not registered\r\nin the _classes_.[293] If, however, we believe in the originally military\r\ncharacter of the organisation, there seems no place for this class which\r\nis not already filled by the _accensi_ and _velati_. At a later period\r\nthe _accensi_ became a more definite body, acting as assistants to the\r\nmagistrates and forming a corporation with certain immunities,[294]\r\nand at this period the _proletarii_ may have been recognised as the\r\nclass liable to taxation, which fell below the minimum census. But they\r\nprobably do not belong to the original Servian organisation.\r\n\r\nThe citizens included in the census list were collectively described as\r\n_classici_, and were spoken of as _locupletes_ and _assidui_, the latter\r\nword probably meaning people “settled on land,” “landholders,” as most of\r\nthose originally enrolled in the _classes_ were.[295] The others were the\r\nchildren-begetting citizens (_proletarii cives_). The use of the census\r\nfor purposes of taxation gave other names to this class. In contrast to\r\nthe _assidui_, who were registered on their property, they were called\r\n_capite censi_ as being registered on their _caput_ or mere headship of\r\na family; and further, when the incidence of taxation extended below\r\nthe minimum census, they were spoken of as _aerarii_, because their\r\nparticipation in the burdens of the state was shown only by the payment\r\nof taxes (_aes_). The word _aerarii_ seems always to have denoted those\r\noutside the census list.[296]\r\n\r\nThe cavalry was an adaptation of the old patrician corps of\r\n_equites_[297] to the new conditions. The six original centuries were\r\npreserved and consisted as before of Patricians;[298] they still bore the\r\nnames of the ancient tribes, and were called respectively _Titienses_,\r\n_Ramnes_, _Luceres_, _priores_ and _posteriores_.[299] They continued to\r\nbe known as the _sex centuriae_, or (after the centuries acquired voting\r\npower) the _sex suffragia_.[300]\r\n\r\nTo these were added twelve new centuries (_centuriae equitum_),\r\ncomposed, like the _classes_, of Patricians and Plebeians. But, unlike\r\nthe _classes_, they were not enrolled on a property qualification. This\r\nis explained by the fact that they are not a list of men qualified for\r\nservice but actually in service, a standing corps selected by the king\r\nand whose expenses were largely defrayed by the state. In later times,\r\neach knight was on his entrance into the corps given the means wherewith\r\nto furnish himself with a pair of horses[301] (_aes equestre_), and also\r\na regular sum of money for their support (_aes hordearium_), the latter\r\nmoney being defrayed by unmarried women and orphans, who were possessed\r\nof property but could not by the nature of the case be rated in the\r\ncensus.[302]\r\n\r\nEach of these centuries formed a troop of one hundred men under a\r\n_centurio_,[303] and these eighteen centuries of Roman knights with\r\npublic horses (_equites Romani equo publico_) continued unaltered in\r\nnumbers and (with the exception that the _sex suffragia_ ceased to be\r\nchosen from the Patricians) in character to the end of the Republic.\r\nAlthough no definite census was required for the class, it was probably\r\nchosen from the first from the richest and most distinguished citizens;\r\nfor its permanent existence implies leisure. The class was not divided\r\nby age into _seniores_ and _juniores_, for an obvious military reason.\r\nThey were all _juniores_, and probably young men, whose release from the\r\ncenturies was granted as soon as age had impaired their efficiency for\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThis centuriate organisation seems to have little or no connexion with\r\nthe four Servian tribes,[304] beyond the accidental one that the basis\r\nof qualification was mainly land, and that all land which was private\r\nproperty was registered in the tribes. Its primary meaning was the\r\nassembly and registration of those liable for military service. It\r\nacquired a secondary meaning when (at what period we do not know but\r\nperhaps from its first organisation) it was used as a scheme for the\r\ncollection of taxes on the registered wealth of the citizens in the\r\n_classes_. The act of registration (_census_) was a solemn religious\r\nfunction conducted by the king. He numbered his fighting force, saw that\r\neach warrior was in his due rank, excluded from these ranks men who were\r\nstained with sin, and then concluded the examination with a ceremony of\r\npurification (_lustrum_). It is only with reference to the collection of\r\ntaxes imposed at this levy that the tribe would be of importance. The\r\ncentury was a military unit, dissolved as soon as the army was disbanded;\r\nthe tribe was permanent, hence the war-tax (_tributum_) was perhaps\r\ncollected from the first by the presidents of the tribes.[305]\r\n\r\nA transference of political rights from the patrician body to this new\r\nassembly was so far from being the motive of the change that it was\r\nprobably never contemplated. But such a transference was from the nature\r\nof things inevitable. Apart from the general fact that a citizen army\r\nmust gain the preponderance in political power, there were certain public\r\nacts which were inevitably performed from the first by the assembly of\r\nthe centuries, or were very soon found to be more rapidly, easily, and\r\nappropriately performed by that assembly than by the _comitia_ of the\r\n_curiae_.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it may have been the custom for the oath of allegiance to the\r\nking, first expressed in the _lex curiata_,[306] to have been renewed at\r\nevery taking of the census. This expression of allegiance, asked for by\r\nthe magistrate, was now a _lex centuriata_.[307]\r\n\r\nSecondly, most of the popular utterances or _leges_ of early Rome must\r\nhave referred to military matters, and convenience, if not a sense of\r\nconsistency, must soon have dictated that they should be pronounced\r\nby the army. The choice of officers rested with the king; but if the\r\nappointment of the higher delegates required the ratification of the\r\npeople,[308] this must soon have been given by the centuries. The\r\nregal jurisdiction which the people challenge by the _provocatio_ is\r\nessentially military jurisdiction;[309] and consequently the exercise of\r\nthis jurisdiction, when the king allowed the appeal, must soon have been\r\nfelt to belong to the army. It was to this assembly that the announcement\r\nof a proposal to declare war[310] would most appropriately be made; it\r\nwas above all by this assembly, which represented the taxpayers, that the\r\nwar-tax (_tributum_) would most appropriately be assessed.\r\n\r\nWe cannot trace the successive steps in the acquisition of power by the\r\ncenturies or its growth from an army into a _comitia_. They must have\r\nbeen the chief political changes which filled the closing years of the\r\nmonarchy and the early days of the Republic; for even the abolition of\r\nmonarchy itself, revolutionary as it was, was less of an alteration\r\nin the structure of the constitution than this transference of the\r\nattributes of sovereignty from one assembly to another, from a single\r\nto a mixed order. The _comitia curiata_ was not suddenly stripped of\r\nits powers; but the organising genius of a single supreme magistrate\r\nhad prepared the way for a change, which was a prototype of the gradual\r\ninsensible revolutions through which Rome was to pass.\r\n\r\nThe change which closes the history of this period, although not so\r\nradical, was far more sudden and violent. The monarchy itself was\r\noverthrown. History has tried to invest this revolution with all the\r\nlegal grounds and legal forms which it could summon to its assistance.\r\nServius had had it in his mind to complete his democratic work by laying\r\ndown the full _imperium_;[311] and Tarquin the Proud, the last of the\r\ngreat Etruscan line, had broken through the constitutional usages of\r\nthe monarchy[312] and had ruled without challenging the allegiance of\r\nthe people.[313] That there was some fearful abuse of the kingly power,\r\ntypified in the associations that gathered round the words _rex_ and\r\n_regnum_ and in the oath which made any one who aspired to monarchy an\r\noutlaw,[314] we may without hesitation allow; for Rome, as shown by the\r\npower she continued to entrust to her magistrates, had not outgrown the\r\nidea of royalty. But there was no constitutional mode of deposing a king.\r\nThe auspices had returned to the fathers in unhallowed fashion, and the\r\nwar waged by Tarquin and Etruria is a war for the maintenance of the\r\nprinciple of divine right. But yet Rome held that the divinity of the\r\nmagistracy still remained; the auspices again left the fathers’ hands and\r\nwere conferred on two citizens chosen from the _patres_.[315]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE GROWTH OF THE REPUBLICAN CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two new magistrates, who were appointed to the headship of the\r\nstate, were, like the king, armed with the _imperium_ and its united\r\npowers of military leadership and jurisdiction. Hence they bore the old\r\ntitles of _praetores_ and _judices_,[316] while those designations which\r\ndenoted a single supremacy in the state, such as _dictator_ or _magister\r\npopuli_, were necessarily discarded. The new magistrates were to hold\r\noffice for a year and then to transmit their power to two successors.\r\nBut their right of nomination was not final. They were, indeed, free\r\nto name as their successors whom they pleased, but this nomination had\r\nto be ratified immediately by the people assembled in their centuries;\r\nand perhaps they were already expected to submit to this _comitia_ the\r\nnames of all candidates who offered themselves for this post, although\r\nthey could certainly decline to receive such names,[317] and nomination,\r\nor, as it was sometimes called, _creatio_, was an essential part of\r\nthe early consular elections. A new practice, that of direct election,\r\nwas thus introduced into the Roman constitution, but it was merely an\r\nadvance on the previous practice of ratifying a nomination.[318] A far\r\nnewer idea—one which distinguished the consulship from the monarchy,\r\nand continued to differentiate it from the dictatorship subsequently\r\ncreated—was that of _colleagueship_,[319] of two officials exercising\r\nexactly the same sphere of competence, with the inevitable effect of\r\ncollision if agreement could not be secured. Perpetual collision was\r\naverted by the simple rule that the dissent of one magistrate rendered\r\nnull and void the action of his colleague. But if such dissent was not\r\nexpressed (or not capable of expression through the absence of the\r\ncolleague) the command of a single magistrate had binding force on the\r\ncommunity. His regal competence was not diminished, but only potentially\r\nchecked, by the presence of a colleague. Colleagueship, considered as the\r\nsafeguard against abuse of the _imperium_, grew to be so firmly impressed\r\non popular imagination as the characteristic feature of the new office,\r\nthat the earlier titles derived from the monarchy gave place to that of\r\n_consules_.[320]\r\n\r\nBut this limitation was not sufficient. The unrestricted military\r\njurisdiction of the magistrate was felt not to be in harmony with the\r\nnew _régime_. A law was passed by P. Valerius, the first of the consuls,\r\nallowing an appeal to the people in their centuries against every\r\nsentence of a magistrate which was pronounced against the life of a Roman\r\ncitizen. This _lex Valeria_ (509 B.C.) completed the popular jurisdiction\r\nwhich had been growing up during the monarchy,[321] and from this time no\r\npower but the people has the right to pronounce the final death sentence\r\nwithin the walls;[322] outside this sphere the military jurisdiction of\r\nthe consul can be asserted without appeal—hence the distinction between\r\nthe _imperium_ at home (_domi_) and abroad (_militiae_); the limit\r\nbetween the spheres being originally the _pomerium_, later the first\r\nmilestone from the city.[323] Without this limit the axes are borne\r\nwithin the _fasces_, within it they are laid aside. Tradition adds that\r\nit was this final recognition of popular sovereignty which led to the\r\ncustom of the consul lowering the _fasces_ before the people when he\r\naddressed them.[324] It does not appear that this great change was forced\r\non the higher organs of the state by any popular agitation. It is no part\r\nof a distinctively plebeian movement. Senate and People, Patricians and\r\nPlebeians must have equally accepted as inevitable the doom of a power\r\nwhich had been dwindling to a shadow during the monarchy.\r\n\r\nThe change from monarchy also witnessed the first attempt to weaken\r\nthe unity of the executive power. The consuls were given two general\r\nassistants, the annually appointed _quaestores_. We have noticed the\r\ntradition which assigns these officials to the regal period,[325] but\r\nit is not wholly inconsistent with that which represents them as a part\r\nof the new constitution of 509. From being temporary delegates they now\r\nbecame permanent assistants of the consuls. Their sphere was as unlimited\r\nas that of the consuls themselves; they were meant simply to obey his\r\nbehests. But two departments in which they represented the supreme\r\nmagistracy must have stood out prominently from the first. These were\r\ncriminal jurisdiction and finance.[326] The “city quaestors” (_quaestores\r\nurbani_), as they were subsequently called to distinguish them from their\r\nprovincial colleagues, were known as _quaestores parricidii_[327] and\r\n_quaestores aerarii_. In their first capacity they were delegates whom\r\nthe magistrate employed in criminal jurisdiction, probably occupying with\r\nrespect to procedure much the same place as the _duoviri_ in the trial\r\nof Horatius.[328] The designation _parricidii_ may, however, show that\r\nthey were employed in such criminal cases as did not directly affect the\r\nwelfare of the state,[329] and by their side the _duoviri perduellionis_\r\nreappear at intervals during the early Republic. Their financial\r\nfunctions are generally taken to imply the existence of a state treasury\r\n(_aerarium_). Tradition credits the first consul Valerius Publicola with\r\nits institution, and makes the quaestors the guardians of its wealth\r\nand probably of its archives.[330] The public chest of Rome must have\r\nbeen a primitive matter enough at a time when coined money was not in\r\ngeneral use; but it is not improbable that finance did at this time\r\nbecome a definite department. It could no longer be a purely domestic\r\nmatter; the lands of the kings had become crown lands of the state; the\r\nseries of wars into which Rome was plunged must have rendered a constant\r\ncollection of the war-tax necessary; none would more naturally have been\r\nentrusted with the control and disbursement of revenue than the perpetual\r\ndelegates of the consuls; and the formalism of Roman character would\r\nlead us to believe that the consuls had regular modes of acting through\r\ntheir quaestors, and that these officials so far limited the power of\r\ntheir masters. It is not improbable that the quaestors were originally\r\nnominated by the consuls without the direct intervention of the people;\r\nbut this does not exclude some popular ratification of the choice.[331]\r\nIt was not until about the year 449 that their election was transferred\r\nto the newly-constituted _comitia_ of the tribes.\r\n\r\nAnd, as the consuls nominated their delegates, so the regal tradition was\r\ncontinued which gave them the nomination of their council of state, the\r\nSenate. In their choice of members they were legally as unfettered as\r\nthe king had been, and could summon new members or omit to summon those\r\nalready on the list.[332] So far as law went, the personnel of the Senate\r\nmight now be changed annually. But custom must have been stronger than\r\nlaw. The body had gained a definiteness in its constitution, based on its\r\nrepresentative character and probably on actual life-membership, which\r\ncould not be easily destroyed, and the consul had a colleague at his side\r\nto check any attempt at capricious removal or selection. The short tenure\r\nof office must already have made a magistrate unwilling to exercise a\r\npower which might be so easily turned against himself in the near future.\r\nThe discretionary power of the magistrate would have made the choice of\r\nPlebeians possible, now that they were possessed of all the essential\r\nrights of full citizenship;[333] but it does not appear that this choice\r\ncould have been often, if ever, exercised. The patrician clans had a\r\nclose hereditary connexion with the Senate; the _interregnum_, which was\r\nthe transmission of auspices by the _patres_, had long been one of its\r\nprivileges, and the prejudices of the patrician magistracy would hardly\r\nhave allowed it to dip into the inferior order for councillors. If there\r\nbe any truth in the story that, on the abolition of the monarchy, the\r\nthinned ranks of the _patres_ were again raised to 300 by the inclusion\r\nof persons specially enrolled (_adlecti_ or _conscripti_),[334] these\r\nadded members were probably, like their predecessors, patrician.\r\nThis large increase (placed by some at 164 members) gave rise to a\r\ntransitory distinction between the older members and the new members,\r\nwhich—expressed in the formula of summons “qui patres, qui conscripti\r\n(estis)”—was finally merged in the general appellation of “conscript\r\nfathers.”[335] The expression may have originated with the abandonment\r\nor modification of some original principle of selection; but, if\r\n_conscripti_ be taken to apply wholly to Plebeians, some date later than\r\nthe commencement of the Republic must be accepted for the origin of the\r\nterm.[336]\r\n\r\nThe history, indeed, of the next hundred and fifty years shows that the\r\nSenate is the stronghold of patrician prejudice. The power from which\r\nthe Plebeians try to shake themselves free, is the _patrum auctoritas_,\r\nand the magistracy must soon have yielded to the demands of the new\r\nburgesses, had it not been backed up by a patrician council. Yet during\r\nthe early Republic the Senate was a power distinctly secondary to the\r\nmagistrates. Its two undoubted prerogatives were the _interregnum_\r\nand the _patrum auctoritas_. The first was exercised, perhaps, more\r\noccasionally even than it had been under the monarchy, for it could\r\nnot be resorted to if one of the two consuls existed to nominate a\r\nsuccessor. The second power, on the other hand, must have become far\r\nmore formal than it had been in the time of the monarchy. Then it had\r\nbeen little more than the claim of the council to be consulted on\r\nimportant business;[337] now it was put forward as an integral part\r\nof the procedure of the state; it was framed after the voting in the\r\nassembly had taken place, and no law or election could be valid which\r\nhad not, after it had passed the people, received this formal consent of\r\nthe _patres_. We cannot trace the widening of the other powers of the\r\nSenate; but we must assume that it took up a more independent position\r\nin face of the consuls than it had done in that of the king. Perhaps the\r\nestablishment of a treasury and of financial quaestors, who may have\r\nbeen selected from the council, led to its first connexion with finance.\r\nThe new importance that foreign affairs assumed, in the constant wars in\r\nwhich Rome was engaged with the nations of Italy, must certainly have\r\nstrengthened its control of this department.\r\n\r\nBut, on the whole, the earliest period of the history of the Republic is\r\nthe epoch of the power of the magistracy. The traditions of the monarchy\r\nwere so little forgotten that eight years after the establishment of\r\nthe Republic, kingship in a modified form was again restored.[338]\r\nIn 501 B.C., during a war with the Latins, the consuls nominated an\r\nindividual with the royal title and powers. It was understood that this\r\n_magister populi_, or, as he was afterwards called, _dictator_,[339]\r\nwas to remain in power only so long as the danger lasted; as the danger\r\nwas originally military, a single campaign of six months was held to be\r\nthe maximum duration of the office. During this time he was to exercise\r\nthe full regal _imperium_, within as well as without the city, and the\r\naccompanying military jurisdiction without appeal. He was originally\r\nunderstood to be a purely military official and the commander of the\r\ninfantry force; the command of the cavalry he entrusted to a magistrate\r\nwho, on the analogy of the magistracies of the monarchy, was a delegate\r\nof his own, and bore the title “master of the horse” (_magister\r\nequitum_).[340] The dictatorship was conceived of as a purely military\r\noffice, and, though it was occasionally used for other purposes in the\r\nlater constitution, never lost its primitive character. Although it\r\nimpeded for a time some of the most characteristic functions of the\r\nconsuls, it was not a suspension, but a part of, the constitution. A\r\nsmall, struggling, and essentially military society, such as that of\r\nearly Rome, contemplated martial law as an occasional necessity; there\r\nwere times when the peril of the state was so great that it was felt\r\nthat the citizens’ ordinary guarantees of protection should sink into\r\nabeyance if they were thought likely to interfere with the safety of the\r\ncommonwealth. The dictatorship had an internal as well as an external\r\nside to its military character; it was even, perhaps, on its earliest\r\ninstitution, meant to control disobedient citizens as well as to oppose\r\nthe enemy,[341] and was thus to some extent a party weapon in the hands\r\nof the Patricians against the refractory Plebs. We shall find that\r\nthis summary military jurisdiction within the city was subsequently\r\nabolished, without much loss to the utility of the institution. Its\r\ntrue merit was the unity of administration which it created, the\r\nadvantages of which were made more apparent by the clashing powers of\r\nthe magistrates at a later stage of history. But the experience of the\r\nevils of divided authority did not first point out the necessity of the\r\noffice. The dictatorship was an integral part of the original Republican\r\nconstitution; the law allowing it was forgotten—perhaps it was the first\r\n_lex Valeria_ which secured the appeal against the ordinary magistrates;\r\nbut the right of the consul to declare martial law, as he did by\r\nappointing a dictator, was never questioned as was the parallel right,\r\nusurped by the Senate in later times, of arming the consul with military\r\njurisdiction. But, although the nomination of a dictator could not be\r\nregarded as a violation of, or even as a break in, the constitution,\r\nit was rightly held to be a powerful party weapon in the hands of the\r\npatrician magistracy; and the attempts of the Plebs were directed,\r\nhowever unsuccessfully, to limit this mighty power which over-rode all\r\nprivilege and law.\r\n\r\nBut the appointment of a dictator was supposed to be due to exceptional\r\ncircumstances. It is only when we look to the peaceful life of the state,\r\nto the administration of law by the magistrate or the expression of\r\npopular will in the _comitia_, that we can estimate the strength of the\r\nposition held by the patrician families.\r\n\r\nThe criminal law, which was doubtless during this period becoming more\r\nand more secularised and divorced from the direct control of religion,\r\nwas the monopoly of the official class. A criminal case was an inquiry\r\nundertaken solely on the initiative of the magistrate; no question\r\ncould come before the people until he had investigated it, and was\r\nthen only submitted in a _form prepared by him_. In the early popular\r\ncourts at Rome there was no power of amendment; the people could answer\r\nonly “Yes” or “No” to the question put before them. We are ignorant of\r\nthe extent of popular jurisdiction; it is possible that only sentences\r\naffecting the _caput_ of a citizen were submitted to the assembly.[342]\r\nBut there was no real guarantee that even such questions could be\r\nforced from the magistrate’s court. The _lex Valeria_ which admitted\r\nthe _provocatio_ imposed no penalty on the magistrate who violated its\r\nprovisions; the only hope lay in the veto of his colleague, and, if two\r\nconsuls were in agreement, they might ride roughshod over the law. The\r\nconsuls were ostensibly the only guardians of the criminal code; as it\r\nis inconceivable that, in an age which made little use of writing, two\r\nmen selected on very varied grounds could have been regarded as fit\r\nexpounders of this form of _jus_, we must, even in the domain of criminal\r\nlaw, go behind them and seek its true source in that formidable body,\r\nthe college of pontiffs. The learning and activity of this body is known\r\nto us, however, chiefly in connexion with the divine or family or, as it\r\nwould have been called in later times, the civil law. The change from\r\nmonarchy to aristocracy introduced, in Rome as in Greece, an epoch of\r\nreligious tyranny. A king, who is the head of the religious as well as of\r\nthe secular life of the state, may hold the balance between the classes.\r\nHe is more likely to repress than to encourage his advisers; he may find\r\nin popular rights a useful check to religious insolence. But remove the\r\nking and substitute an aristocracy like the Patriciate whose members hold\r\nsupreme office in turn; let there be no distinction between clergy and\r\nlaity in this body, so that there can be no conflict between the secular\r\nand sacred power, which may enable a third power to gain a footing; and\r\nlet this body have a monopoly of the civil law—and we get unequalled\r\npossibilities of judicial tyranny. For two hundred years (509-304) the\r\nknowledge of the forms of procedure, the _legis actiones_, which formed\r\nthe whole content of the civil law, was open to the patrician pontiffs\r\nalone.[343] We are told that, even after the outlined codification and\r\npublication of the law in the Twelve Tables, the formularies could only\r\nbe repeated correctly under the guidance of the college, which for this\r\npurpose annually appointed one of its members to “preside over private\r\nsuits.” It is true that the theory of civil procedure was the same as\r\nit had been in the time of the monarchy; the magistrate decided what\r\nspecial rule of process was applicable, and then the case was settled\r\nby an arbitrator chosen by the litigants.[344] But the magistrate must\r\noften have been unskilled, one of the college must always have stood by\r\nhis side, and the pontiff so officiating was not merely an adviser to\r\nthe parties but a witness to the performance. The pontiffs, however,\r\nwere more than interpreters. They had, as the guardians of _fas_, their\r\nown sphere of law, relics of which survived into the late Republic,\r\nand within this sphere they were judges. They had a graduated scale of\r\nexpiations for sins (_piacula_); they were the police who protected the\r\nsanctity of festal days (_feriae_), and inflicted spiritual penalties on\r\nthe magistrate himself who dared to exercise jurisdiction on a day which\r\nthey had declared holy; they issued and enforced commands which protected\r\nsacred places (_loci sacri_) and burial-grounds.[345] Vows (_vota_), to\r\nbe effective, must be prescribed by them, and peculiarly efficacious\r\nwere those fixed forms of prayer (_certae precationes_) which they had\r\ndictated word for word (_de scripto praeire_).\r\n\r\nAgainst this phalanx of patrician power what forces could the Plebeians\r\nboast?\r\n\r\nA certain amount of voting power in the _comitia_ was all that they\r\npossessed. But this voting power, except on certain established\r\npoints—the declaration of war and, when the law was observed, criminal\r\njurisdiction—was very ineffective, for the assembly was wholly dependent\r\nfor its summons and expression of opinion on the patrician consuls, and\r\nliable to interruption from the pious scruples of patrician augurs; and\r\nwe have already seen how even the choice of magistrates could be hampered\r\nby the formalities which still conditioned the election.[346] But, even\r\nhad these adverse circumstances been avoided, the voting power of the\r\nPlebeians was small. The _comitia centuriata_ contained chiefly the\r\npropertied—for the most part the landed—class; and even in this assembly\r\nthe two first classes and the knights, which would have consisted mainly\r\nof Patricians, had a majority of votes (118 out of 193). The small\r\nfarmers and the artisans commanded but 74 or 75 votes; the great mass of\r\nthe Proletariate was either wholly unrepresented or could dispose of but\r\na single vote. It is important to inquire whether these classes excluded\r\nfrom the centuries were represented elsewhere, or whether there was an\r\nassembly possessing any real power in which Patricians and Plebeians were\r\nalike represented.\r\n\r\nIt has been proved beyond a doubt that at some period during the first\r\nthree centuries of the Republic Plebeians came to be included in the\r\n_comitia curiata_.[347] The change was the result of two circumstances;\r\nfirstly, the perfect equality of private rights between the members\r\nof the two orders—adrogation and adoption, both of which followed the\r\npossession of a _familia_, and in many cases _gentilitas_, being common\r\nto both—which rendered it impossible to draw distinctions amongst the\r\n_curiales_; and secondly, the reactionary influence of the centuriate\r\nassembly, which emphasised the idea that Patricians and Plebeians\r\ntogether made up the Populus.\r\n\r\nSuch a change must have been gradual; but, when it had occurred, the\r\nadmission of the Plebeians made this assembly thoroughly democratic in\r\nform, for a vote in this _comitia_ depended neither on land or wealth,\r\nbut simply on personal membership of a _curia_, which was common to all\r\nthe citizens. But it is the very comparison of such a body with the\r\nthoroughly timocratic organisation of the _comitia centuriata_ which\r\nleads us to believe that, at the time when the Plebeians were admitted,\r\nthe _curiae_ had ceased to be a power. The condition reached by the\r\n_comitia curiata_ in historical times will be described elsewhere. Its\r\nmost distinctive right—the _lex curiata_—had perhaps been a real power\r\nin the hands of the Patricians, as long as they were its sole members,\r\nalthough their preponderance in the _comitia centuriata_ would have made\r\na conflict between these two bodies unlikely; but there probably never\r\nwas a time when the masses of the Plebs gathered _curiatim_ upset the\r\nverdict of the Patricians and wealthy Plebeians assembled _centuriatim_.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider this situation, it is not surprising that the leading\r\nfeatures of the first period of development of the Roman constitution\r\n(494-287 B.C.) were an attempt to limit the power of the magistrates,\r\nand a struggle of the Plebs for equality with the Patriciate. The two\r\nstruggles do not run on parallel lines but are interwoven at every point,\r\nsince the magistracy represented the Patriciate. Nor do they represent\r\nmerely an effort to weaken or to obtain political privilege; in their\r\nearlier stages the motive of the Plebs is not ambition, but defence.\r\nTheir first efforts have the negative object of the protection of rights,\r\nnot the positive design of an attempt to share in a political power which\r\nwas closed to their order.\r\n\r\nTradition represents the earliest social struggles of the Plebs as\r\ncentring round two questions—the possession of the public land, and the\r\nlaw of debtor and creditor. They were no doubt closely connected, for\r\nassignment of land meant relief of debt, but the agitation that gathered\r\nround the public land was directed by individuals, was merely occasional,\r\nand led to no permanent results; it is less a part of constitutional\r\nthan of political history, and its true nature is obscured by the fact\r\nthat we cannot say how far the annalists have transferred to this early\r\nperiod the circumstances of the agrarian agitation of a later day. But\r\nthe early mode of assignment of the public land deserves consideration;\r\nfor, as one of the undoubted grievances of the Plebs, it may have been\r\none of the motives that led to the first great political reform. Land\r\nconquered from the enemy was sometimes assigned to poorer citizens in\r\nsmall allotments by the state (_ager assignatus_); in later times it was\r\nsometimes sold by the state through its quaestors (_ager quaestorius_);\r\nand in both these cases it became private property. But, in the early\r\nRepublic, the custom was growing up of leaving a great portion of\r\nconquered land—especially such as was fit only for pasturage or had been\r\ndevastated in war—as state domain (_ager publicus_), and of allowing\r\nit to be held in usufruct (_occupatio_) by squatters who paid to the\r\nstate for their privilege a proportion of the produce (_vectigal_), a\r\ntithe or a fifth. Large portions of such _ager publicus_ had probably\r\nbeen originally a part of the king’s domains, and had been held by his\r\nclients, who would, of course, have been members of the lower class of\r\nthe Plebs. But under the new conditions of things it was all the property\r\nof the state; and the theory was started, or confirmed, that in this\r\ncase Patricians alone could be its occupants,[348] a privilege that had\r\nprobably originated with the assumption that only the conquerors of the\r\nland could share in the spoils of war.[349] This privilege—comprehensible\r\nbut legally absurd in that it involved the theory that clients of the\r\nstate must belong to a particular order—could no longer be upheld on the\r\nsame grounds, for Plebeians now marched to battle and could justly claim\r\na share in the prizes of war. But the maintenance of this principle, even\r\nif justly carried out, could not have wholly solved the social problem.\r\nThe Proletariate, who had no share in winning the prize, would have still\r\nbeen justly excluded; but it would at least have benefited the small\r\nplebeian farmer, and perhaps it was he that had most need of benefit.\r\n\r\nFor the small independent landholder was in a hopeless plight—far more\r\nhopeless than that of the client or emancipated slave who could claim\r\nhis lord’s protection. His condition was due to the law of debtor and\r\ncreditor—one, it seems, that was unknown to the old patrician community,\r\nand had originated within the plebeian order, but which the Patriciate,\r\nby adopting plebeian forms of law, could use with terrible force against\r\nits inventors. The original procedure was one of the manifold forms of\r\n_nexum_, or binding obligation created by the copper and the scales\r\n(_per aes et libram_). A man who borrowed was allowed to sell his\r\nperpetual services to his creditor conditionally—the condition being the\r\nnon-repayment of the debt within a given time.[350] When the prescribed\r\nperiod had elapsed, the debtor and his whole _familia_ passed into\r\nthe power of his purchaser; he became his bondsman (_nexus_) until the\r\ndebt was paid by his labour. As in such circumstances the debt was\r\nnever likely to be liquidated, the small farmer became a mere dependent\r\nmember of the household of the rich landowner, leaning on his mercy and\r\nsubject to his caprice. No judicial process was necessary to create the\r\ncondition. The simple proof (perhaps given before a magistrate) of the\r\nwitnesses to the contract was all that was required. The enslavement of\r\nthe citizen was, it is true, forbidden by Roman public law,[351] and the\r\n_nexus_ remained a burgess.[352] But a very thin line separated such a\r\ncondition from one of actual slavery.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that in early times plebeian law recognised no debt except\r\nthat created by the nexal contract. But as Roman commerce extended it\r\nwas impossible to observe this limitation; refinements of procedure\r\nextended this penalty to debts incurred by the patrician form of mere\r\nverbal promise (_stipulatio_, _sponsio_). The form of procedure in this\r\ncase is known to us from the Twelve Tables. If the debt was confessed\r\nor proved before a court, an interval of thirty days was given to the\r\ndebtor wherein to pay; at the end of this period he was arrested by the\r\ncreditor (_manus injectio_) and brought before the consul, by whom, if\r\nno champion (_vindex_) presented himself to contest the debt, he was\r\nbound over (_addictus_) to the creditor. The latter could take him home\r\nand put him in bonds, but must give him a pound of corn a day. Another\r\ninterval of sixty days followed, within which the prisoner was presented\r\nto the magistrate on three court days (_nundinae_). On the last his\r\nfate was sealed. He was no longer in the condition even of the _nexus_.\r\nHis creditor might put him to death or sell him as a slave beyond the\r\nTiber.[353] If there were more creditors than one,[354] they might\r\ndivide the debtor’s body into equal portions; and the Twelve Tables\r\ngave immunity to the creditor who took more than his fair share of the\r\nflesh. This death-penalty was doubtless a humane alternative to perpetual\r\nimprisonment. Even if it did not submit the penalty, as a capital one,\r\nto appeal (_provocatio_), the danger, which could be brought home to\r\nrelatives and friends by gradual mutilation, disfiguring but not fatal,\r\nmust have roused their efforts to effect a ransom. It was the application\r\nof this law of debt, perhaps in even a harsher and more primitive form,\r\nthat called forth the first resistance from the Plebs. The perpetual\r\nstruggle for existence in which Rome was now engaged kept her armies\r\nconstantly in the field, and the small farmer on service, who had no\r\nslaves, had to let his farm go to ruin in his absence and to mortgage\r\nhis body when he returned.[355] The most obvious remedy was a general\r\nstrike against the military levy; and this was attempted. Already in 495\r\na riot had been raised in Rome, which was only appeased by the promises\r\nof a popular consul, Servilius, that the _nexi_ should be released for\r\nservice, and that no one should seize goods or pledges from a soldier\r\nwhile he was in the field. The liberated citizens scattered the Volsci\r\nand Aurunci; their reward was a more rigorous enforcement of the law\r\nof debt by the other consul Appius. Servilius was appealed to, but\r\nwould not use his right of veto against his colleague. It was plain\r\nthat no one could rely on a consul’s _auxilium_ being used on behalf of\r\nthe Plebs.[356] A fierce stand against the conscription was now made\r\nby the desperate Plebeians; the patrician answer was the appointment\r\nof a dictator. Again the army took the field against the Volscians\r\nand the Sabines; but, when victory was assured, the legions were not\r\ndisbanded, and a pretext was found for another campaign. On the march\r\nfrom Rome the plebeian contingents suddenly turned aside to a hill in the\r\nterritory of Crustumerium, which, from the oath taken on its summit, was\r\nthenceforth called the “Mount of Curses” (_sacer mons_).[357] A plan,\r\ncarefully thought out in the coteries and gatherings that had preceded\r\nthe campaign,[358] was now carried into effect. The Plebs had already\r\ngathered in informal meetings (_concilia_) to discuss their grievances.\r\nAll that they lacked to become a corporation which might rival that\r\nof the Populus, was to have at their head magistrates with great and\r\nrecognised powers. They were now met in battle array to carry out this\r\nresolve; and it was not unnatural that the two plebeian magistrates whom\r\nthey chose to rival the power of the consuls should bear the military\r\nappellation of tribunes.[359] It was made a condition of reconciliation\r\nwith the patrician state which they had quitted, that these officers\r\nshould have the power of suspending the decree of the consuls when\r\nlevelled against a member of the Plebs. But, since little confidence was\r\nto be reposed in the government, the Plebs bound themselves by an oath,\r\nsimilar to that taken on the expulsion of the king, to destroy any one\r\nwho offered injury or insult to their magistrates. The recognition of\r\nthese new magistrates, with the powers their appointment involved, was\r\neffected by a _lex centuriata_ perhaps passed in the very year of the\r\nsecession (494 B.C.). The office of the _tribuni plebis_ or _plebei_\r\nwas modelled as closely as possible on that of the consuls. They were\r\noriginally two in number, and had, with reference to each other, the\r\nmutual power of veto which the collegiate principle implied. They were\r\nfrom the first magistrates of the Plebs, hence none but Plebeians were\r\neligible,[360] and they must from the first have been elected by an\r\nassembly of the Plebs. This assembly, however, did not perpetuate its\r\noriginal military character, and the unit of voting naturally selected\r\nfor the city-gatherings at which the tribunes were appointed was the\r\n_curia_, to which Plebeians had for some time belonged. This assembly of\r\nthe Plebs was known as the _concilium plebis curiatim_.[361]\r\n\r\nWith respect to power the tribunate has, from its origin, a double\r\ncharacter. It possesses a negative control of the whole people (generally\r\nin the person of its magistrate) exercised in defence of the Plebs, and\r\na positive authority within the plebeian community. The first power\r\nasserts itself in the right of veto, the second is shown in the power of\r\neliciting resolutions (_scita plebei_ or _plebiscita_) from the plebeian\r\n_concilium_. The first power, that of offering assistance (_auxilium_)\r\nto any Plebeian[362] who feels himself aggrieved by the decree of the\r\nmagistrate, and suspending this decree by the exercise of the “veto,” was\r\nthe _raison d’être_ of the tribunate. The tribune was created to meet\r\nthe consular imperium (_contra consulare imperium_),[363] and the fact\r\nthat he could only exercise this power in person imposed on him certain\r\nobligations. The tribune might not stay a night without the walls, and\r\nthe doors of his house were open day and night.[364] It was doubtless\r\nthrough the insufficiency of these presidents of the Plebs to cope with\r\nthe demands for their assistance that their number was raised first to\r\nfour (471 B.C.), and before the year 449 B.C. to ten[365]—changes which\r\nwere ratified by the centuries and the Senate.\r\n\r\nBut a negative control over the magistrates of the state must be wholly\r\nineffective unless there be some means of enforcing this control. Had\r\nthe tribunes possessed no coercive power, the consul, in carrying out\r\nthe law of debt or in summoning Plebeians for the levy, would simply\r\nhave set their veto aside. We should have expected that such breaches of\r\nthe law would have been guarded against by judicial prosecution before\r\nthe courts of the community. But this was not consistent with the Roman\r\nidea of magistracy. Each magistrate had, to a greater or less degree, the\r\npower of enforcing his own decrees (_coercitio_), limited only by the\r\nright of appeal or the veto of his colleague; and this power could not\r\nbe denied to the tribune. A logical consequence of his right of veto was\r\nthat he could exercise this _coercitio_ against the consuls themselves;\r\nthe sanctity of his person (guaranteed by the Plebs and accepted by\r\nthe Populus) rendered resistance hopeless; and all the weapons of the\r\n_coercitio_—arrest, imprisonment, fines, stripes, and death—were at the\r\ndisposal of the champion of the Plebs.\r\n\r\n_Coercitio_ implies summary jurisdiction; and the infliction of fines\r\nbeyond a certain limit, scourging, or death subjected a magistrate to\r\nthe _provocatio_, and therefore made him a partner in a trial before\r\na popular assembly. Hence the judicial power of the tribune, also a\r\nnecessary consequence of his power of veto. Undoubtedly when the office\r\nwas created this consequence was not foreseen. When it was found to be\r\na necessary accompaniment of the tribunician power, tradition tells us\r\nthat it was questioned by the Patricians. The historically worthless but\r\ntypical trial of C. Marcius Coriolanus in 491 B.C. elicited a protest\r\nthat the _jus_ of the tribunes extended only to Plebeians.[366] The\r\nprotest was idle, for the _jus auxilii_ could not exist without the\r\n_jus poenae_ against its violators. The violation of plebeian rights\r\nwhich was thus met by tribunician coercion and jurisdiction, was always\r\nan infringement of the safety or dignity of the tribune himself. Even\r\nthe infliction of wrong on an individual through the violation of the\r\ntribune’s decree was a wrong done to the Plebs through him; it was not\r\nheld to affect the rest of the community; hence the not unnatural belief\r\nof our annalists that, when the tribune pronounced a sentence against\r\nwhich there was an appeal, he brought the matter before the assembly of\r\nthe Plebs.\r\n\r\nThis right of reference implies the power known as the _jus agendi cum\r\nplebe_. It was a power that could not have been contemplated on the\r\nestablishment of the tribunate, but it proved a necessary consequence of\r\nthe _auxilium_. Its acquirement meant a new infringement of the rights of\r\npatrician magistrates; for the summoning of the Plebs meant the calling\r\naway of a large portion of the Populus from the consuls. Two summonses of\r\ntwo assemblies containing the same individuals by different magistrates\r\nmeant an inevitable conflict of authority, and the tribunician right\r\nof transacting business with the Plebs could not be secured but by a\r\ndefinite guarantee against consular interference. This guarantee was\r\ngiven, tradition says, by a resolution of the Plebs itself, passed in\r\n492 B.C., two years after the institution of the tribunate, under the\r\npresidency of the tribune Sp. Icilius.[367] The date is probably too\r\nearly, and the resolution must have been subsequently ratified by a _lex_\r\nof the centuries. It enacted that when the tribune addressed the Plebs no\r\none should speak against or interrupt him; that the tribune should fine\r\nthe offender and demand securities. If securities were not forthcoming,\r\nthe offender should be punished with death and his property confiscated\r\nto the gods. If the fine were disputed the judgment should rest with\r\nthe people. Whether by “people” here was meant Populus or Plebs, it was\r\ndoubtless on this law that the plebeian assembly based its jurisdiction\r\nin the case of injury or insult being offered to its magistrate.\r\n\r\nBut the right of acting with the Plebs, which was thus guaranteed to the\r\ntribune, had another and more positive aspect. It might be used to elicit\r\nformal resolutions passed by the whole plebeian _concilium_ in their\r\nown interests, and to give this body the character of a guild which,\r\nwithin certain limits, could pass rules binding on all its members.\r\nSo long as the resolutions of this body were purely self-regarding,\r\ndid not infringe on the public law, and were voluntarily accepted by\r\nall the members, they did not need formal ratification by any higher\r\nauthority. But sometimes resolutions were passed which the Plebs was\r\nincapable of carrying into effect; in this case they were mere petitions\r\nto the only recognised legislative power, the consuls presiding over\r\nthe _comitia centuriata_. We have an instance of this procedure, dated\r\nwithin forty years of the establishment of the tribunate, which shows\r\nhow far-reaching the demands of this _concilium_ might be. In 456 B.C.\r\nthe tribune Icilius elicited from this assembly a resolution to the\r\neffect that the Aventine, until that time state property,[368] should\r\nbe assigned to the Plebs. With this petition he approached the consuls\r\nand the Senate, and requested them to gain the consent of the _comitia\r\ncenturiata_ in due form of law.[369] The same procedure must be imagined\r\nfor any _plebiscita_, which refer to matters affecting the whole\r\ncommunity, down to the year 287, when, as we shall see, these resolutions\r\nof the Plebs were first raised to a level with the laws. In framing its\r\nresolutions the Plebs was as dependent on the tribune as the _comitia_\r\nwas on the consuls; the _rogatio_ of the magistrate could only be\r\nanswered by the “Yes” or “No” of the burgesses. Its elective proceedings\r\nwere similar to those of the whole people. The tribune, before he\r\nquitted office, nominated successors and submitted their names to the\r\nPlebs. The differences were that the voting was by _curiae_ and not by\r\n_centuries_, that the _patrum auctoritas_ had here no place, and that\r\nthe formal taking of the auspices was not necessary to the validity of\r\nthe proceedings, although doubtless the tribunes employed their right of\r\ntaking private auspices[370] to give a sanctity to the act of the Plebs.\r\n\r\nIn one further and less important respect was this community of the Plebs\r\nmodelled on the larger community of the Populus. In the year when the\r\ntribunate was established, the magistrates of the Plebs were given two\r\nassistants,[371] who bore the same relation to them as the two quaestors\r\ndid to the consuls. Their functions were as undefined as those of the\r\nquaestors; but, when the powers of the tribunate were slightly better\r\nestablished, these delegates seem, like their prototypes, to have been\r\nconcerned mainly with criminal jurisdiction and finance. They also kept\r\nthe archives of the Plebs in the temple of Ceres, and it was thought that\r\nit was from this that their name _aediles_ (possibly not their original\r\ntitle) was derived.[372] They served the tribunes in the exercise of\r\ntheir _coercitio_, seizing the offender or inflicting the death penalty.\r\nWe find them performing this function in the trial of Coriolanus.[373]\r\nAfter the tribunes had gained criminal jurisdiction, they assisted them\r\nas delegates.[374] Their original financial functions are somewhat\r\nindefinable; but such functions are suggested by their office at the\r\ntemple of Ceres and the archives which they guarded there—functions which\r\nfind exact parallels in those of the quaestors at the temple of Saturn.\r\nIt may have been one of their duties to exercise some supervision over\r\nthe forced labour (_operae_) of the Plebeians, and this may have led to\r\nan early connexion with the repair of roads and buildings. Their police\r\nfunctions, their supervision of the market, above all their maintenance\r\nof the state religion amongst the masses, can hardly be referred to this\r\nearly period.[375]\r\n\r\nThe aediles may originally have been nominated by their superiors; but\r\nelection by the _concilium_ of the Plebs, under the presidency of a\r\ntribune, is the only form of their appointment which is known to us. The\r\noffice was legalised with the tribunate, and its holder possessed the\r\nsame personal sanctity as the tribune, conferred first by oath and then\r\nby law.[376]\r\n\r\nFor the power of these plebeian magistrates rests wholly on a\r\nsuperstitious belief, consciously applied to fill up a gap in the public\r\nlaw. It might have been thought that magistrates elected by a large body\r\nof the citizens, whose powers were recognised by public law, would have\r\nbeen sufficiently protected by their position. But the Romans were slaves\r\nto legal formulae. The Plebs was not the community, nor even at first\r\na legalised corporation within the city; the tribunes were, therefore,\r\nnot magistrates of the state, and wore none of the insignia of office;\r\nthey had not the _imperium_ and the _auspicia_, and therefore could\r\nnot be protected by the law of treason (_perduellio_), which avenged\r\nwrongs done to the state in the person of its magistrate. A substitute\r\nmust be found in a religious sanction. Perhaps Rome is the only state\r\nthat has definitely invested the demagogue or “champion of the people”\r\nwith a halo of sanctity. This was first given him by the people whom he\r\nchampioned. The Plebs on the Mons Sacer had sworn an oath to destroy any\r\none who destroyed their tribune—an oath which they perpetuated to their\r\ndescendants. The sanctity of the tribunes, therefore, had originally\r\nno valid religious ground, for the Populus had not pronounced such an\r\noffender to be _sacer_, nor had the oath been taken by a magistrate\r\non behalf of the whole community. It was simply a proclamation by a\r\nsection of the people of the infringement of rights which they held would\r\njustify a revolution; and the declaration was accepted by the Roman state\r\nwhen it recognised the tribunate. But the inviolability of plebeian\r\nmagistrates did not gain legal recognition until the reinstitution of\r\nthe office in 449 B.C. Then the violator of the majesty of the tribune\r\nwas made a _sacer homo_[377] in its later sense of “an outlaw” for\r\nthe whole community, and the aediles and the plebeian _decemviri_ were\r\nprotected by the same ban. Yet the Roman jurists held that this law\r\ndid not give _sacrosanctitas_, at least to the tribune; that was given\r\nby the “ancient oath” of the Plebs; the law only announced a penalty\r\nwhich might be carried out by any member of the community. This view\r\nwas of importance, because it recognised the capital jurisdiction of\r\nthe Plebs in all cases where their magistrates had been injured; and,\r\nalthough subsequent practice was unfavourable to this jurisdiction, its\r\nlegality cannot be questioned. The tribune was himself the defender of\r\nhis own personal inviolability and that of his fellow-officers; for it\r\nwas he who summarily inflicted the punishment or proposed the penalty to\r\nthe _concilium_. The crime of infringing plebeian liberties could not\r\noriginally have borne a definite name; in later times it was brought\r\nunder the vague conception of _majestas_, “the infringement of the\r\ngreatness of the state.” The penalty might be a capital one, while the\r\nacts construed as infringement might be very slight indeed. Physical\r\ncompulsion, blows, an attempt at murder were all obvious cases; but\r\nforcible resistance to a tribune’s will[378] came under this head, and,\r\nafter the law which guaranteed the right of meeting to the Plebs, any\r\nact, whether of magistrates or individuals, which interrupted a meeting\r\nof the Plebs summoned by a tribune.[379]\r\n\r\nIn fact, during the earliest years of the struggles of the Plebs, the\r\nrights of the corporation are represented only by the powers of the\r\ntribune, through whom alone it claimed official recognition; and thus\r\nfrom 494 to the epoch of the decemviral legislation (451) the tribunate\r\nis engaged in efforts to gain a better representation of the plebeian\r\ncommunity, and to secure an equality in the administration of the\r\nlaw, which should render the clumsy negative system of the constant\r\ninterposition of their _auxilium_ less necessary.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt seems to have been to some extent secured by the\r\n_plebiscitum_ passed by Publilius Volero in 471, which enacted that the\r\n_concilium_ of the Plebs, instead of meeting as before by _curiae_,\r\nshould now meet by tribes (_tributim_).[380] As this was a purely\r\nself-regarding ordinance, it probably did not require the consent of\r\nSenate and people,[381] and we are told that it was looked on with\r\ndisfavour by the Patricians. The grounds of their objections are not\r\neasily fathomed, nor is the gain to the Plebs brought about by the\r\nchange particularly clear.[382] The number of the tribes at this time is\r\nunknown, but it was probably twenty-one. This growth had been brought\r\nabout by an abandonment of the Servian principle. After the Roman\r\nterritory, lost in great part during the earliest years of the Republic,\r\nhad been regained, a wholly new subdivision of the _ager Romanus_ had\r\nbeen adopted. The four Servian tribes were confined to the ring-wall\r\nof the city, and the land without the walls was now separated into\r\n_tribus_, which were called the country (_rusticae_) as opposed to the\r\ncity tribes (_tribus urbanae_). Sixteen of these country tribes bear the\r\nnames of patrician _gentes_;[383] they must have been named from the\r\nclan settlements and were obviously the first created. It is affirmed by\r\nDionysius[384] that, at the time of the trial of Coriolanus (491 B.C.),\r\nthe number of the tribes was twenty-one; but it has been conjectured with\r\nsome plausibility that the twenty-first was added in this very year 471,\r\nwhen the tribe was first used for voting purposes, in order to create\r\nan inequality of votes, and that it bears its _local_ name (Clustumina\r\nor Crustumina) in memory of the secession of the Plebs to the Sacred\r\nMount.[385] The Plebs may have petitioned the consuls to add one more to\r\nthe divisions of the state; for it was they alone who could effect the\r\nchange, the creation of a tribe being an administrative act which none\r\nbut the magistrates of the community could carry out.\r\n\r\nThese tribes were, like the earlier ones, local, and although there is\r\nno evidence for the view that landholders alone were included in them,\r\nyet the seventeen country tribes would naturally consist for the most\r\npart of peasant proprietors, and would, therefore, be a better organ\r\nfor plebeian sentiment than the _curiae_, throughout which the landless\r\nplebeian clients might still be the representatives of their patrician\r\nlords.\r\n\r\nThis change soon produced an unexpected consequence. At some period\r\nbetween the passing of the Publilian law and the enactment of the Twelve\r\nTables, the new plebeian practice was adopted as a basis for gatherings\r\nof the whole people. The Populus began to meet by tribes, and to form a\r\n_comitia tributa_. The Twelve Tables prove that this body early gained\r\njudicial competence;[386] but the history of the great change which\r\nplaced a democratic assembly of the Populus by the side of the timocratic\r\n_comitia centuriata_ is wholly unknown to us. It is probable that the\r\noriginal power of this new parliament was not extensive, and it may have\r\nbeen confined originally to the hearing of minor judicial appeals from\r\nthe magistrates. About twenty years later it was found convenient to\r\nentrust the election of quaestors to the new assembly. Its attractiveness\r\nlay in the ease and rapidity with which the people might be summoned to\r\nmeet by tribes within the walls, as compared with the stately formalities\r\nof the gathering of the army in the Campus.\r\n\r\nThe second great movement of the tribunate was an attempt to secure an\r\nequal administration of the law.\r\n\r\nIn the year 462 the tribune C. Terentilius Arsa made a proposal to the\r\n_concilium_ of the Plebs that a commission of five should be appointed to\r\nclear up the forms of legal procedure, and by this means to fix limits\r\nto the judicial caprice of the consuls;[387] and in the next year a\r\nresolution of the whole college of tribunes was framed to this effect.\r\nIt was obviously a measure which demanded the sanction of the Populus,\r\nand this it was for many years impossible to obtain. Even apart from the\r\nfact that the tribunes apparently intended their commission to consist\r\nwholly of Plebeians, it was felt to be a proposal that was revolutionary\r\nin the extreme; for it was nothing less than the demand for a code, for\r\na written system of rules which should replace the elastic principles of\r\njustice, which were one of the mainstays of patrician power, and which\r\nwould vulgarise the awful sanctity of the consulate and the pontifical\r\ncollege. It must also have been felt that codification must mean a\r\ncompromise—some recognition of plebeian claims which would weaken the\r\nposition of the ruling caste. Hence a stout opposition on the part\r\nof magistrates and Senate, and the bill, if it passed the _concilium\r\nplebis_ at all,[388] was not allowed to go a step further. But the Plebs\r\npersisted in its efforts, and its answer to patrician opposition was to\r\nreturn year after year the same tribunes, formulating the same demands.\r\nIn 458 B.C. the college approached the consuls on the subject, and asked\r\nthem to formulate their objections to the bill;[389] for the moment there\r\nwas the hope of an agreement, but at the end of the year the consent\r\nrequired was again refused. Three years more of agitation followed,\r\nand then it was felt that the original proposal must be abandoned. The\r\ntribunes expressed their willingness for the initiative to be taken by\r\nthe patrician magistrates, and for a joint commission to be appointed.\r\nMeanwhile the years of discussion had caused the original proposal to\r\nassume larger dimensions. Reform which should bear a wholly non-party\r\ncharacter was suggested in place of a mere codification. Information of\r\nthe Greek Codes was to be gathered by a commission of three—a suggestion\r\nwhich was valuable in many ways; it was useful for purposes of delay, it\r\ngave an appearance of learning and thoroughness to the work, and perhaps\r\nsome such basis was felt to be absolutely necessary for framing rules on\r\npoints which the very indefinite Roman procedure had never considered.\r\nThe return of the envoys in 452, after an absence of three years, renewed\r\nthe demands of the tribunes for the instant prosecution of the work. A\r\ncontroversy between the orders as to the constitution of the commission\r\nended in a compromise. Plebeians might be admitted; but, as a matter of\r\nfact, the patrician influence was so strong that the first board elected\r\nby the _comitia centuriata_ appears to have consisted wholly of members\r\nof that order.[390] The appointment of the commission was a complete\r\nabrogation of the constitution. The consulship was abolished; the Plebs\r\ngave up their tribunate, some have thought in perpetuity, misled by the\r\nhope that the publication of the law would render such a check on the\r\nconsular power unnecessary, and as a part of the compromise with the\r\nPatricians, and stipulated only that certain privileges which they had\r\nalready gained by law should not be abrogated.[391] The provisional\r\ngovernment appointed for the year 451 took the form of a board of ten\r\nmen with consular power but not subject to the law of appeal.[392] The\r\nwork was done within the year, and the code posted up on ten tablets\r\n(_tabulae_) and published to the masses. The people were summoned and\r\ntold that the commission had created equal rights for all,[393] and the\r\nwhole body of law was passed as a _lex_ by the _comitia centuriata_.\r\nBut at the end of the year it was declared that the work was not quite\r\ncomplete. Again the constitution was suspended, and a new board of ten\r\nappointed, this time inclusive of Plebeians.[394] Two new sections were\r\nadded, thus bringing up the number of the _tabulae_ to twelve; these also\r\nwere confirmed by the centuries, and after the government of the “wicked\r\nten” had abused its power and fallen, were published with the rest of the\r\ncode by the consuls of 448.[395]\r\n\r\nAlthough the law of the Twelve Tables (_lex duodecim tabularum_) was\r\nfor the most part a codification of existing rules, it marks a distinct\r\nadvance in the recognition of plebeian rights, and thus was of the utmost\r\npolitical importance in framing rules for the whole state the question\r\nbefore the commissioners was whether the customary law embodied in the\r\ncode should be that which prevailed in the patrician, or that which held\r\ngood in the plebeian community. In almost every important particular\r\nplebeian law was preferred. The reason was not any regard for plebeian\r\nrights (the decemvirs re-enacted the rule forbidding marriage between\r\nthe orders), but the simplicity and the capacity for universality of\r\nthis law. The code is not a hap-hazard collection, but a scientific\r\ncompilation; the aim was a “levelling” of the law, an arbitrament between\r\nclasses, such as had often formed the task of the Greek legislator; and\r\nin effecting this object the commissioners showed more wisdom than any\r\nGreek legislator of whom we hear. The idea of legislating for a class, or\r\nthe still more foolish idea of perfect logical adjustment, are strikingly\r\nabsent. The code is thoroughly Roman in its caution and good sense, its\r\nrespect for the past, which it disregards only when old custom violates\r\nthe rules of common sense, and its judicious contempt for symmetry. Such\r\na code as this might be changed in detail, but was never likely to be\r\nrepealed. It remained the “fountain of all public and private law,” and\r\njustly, for, according to Tacitus, it was the “consummation of equal\r\nright.”[396] Its rhythmical sentences were learnt by heart by school-boys\r\nin Cicero’s time.[397] Elaborate commentaries were written on it by the\r\nrepublican lawyer Aelius, and the imperial jurist Gaius, and by Labeo,\r\nwho stands at the meeting-point between the two _régimes_; and in the\r\nsixth century A.D. Justinian, in the old age of the world, still respects\r\nmany of the provisions which date from the infancy of Roman legislation.\r\n\r\nThe Twelve Tables contained the “whole body of Roman law” (_corpus omnis\r\nRomani juris_),[398] not in the sense that they were a complete and\r\ndetailed system, but in the sense that they pronounced on all important\r\nor disputed points in all departments of law, private, criminal, and\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nThe ordinances of private law embraced regulations as to marriage and\r\nfamily relations, testamentary disposition, inheritance, debt, and usury.\r\nThe marriage recognised was the consensual contract of the Plebeians\r\nstrengthened by _usus_. Emancipation was recognised as a consequence of\r\nthe threefold sale of a son, and a form of adoption, probably already\r\nin use in the plebeian community, was thus made universal.[399] The law\r\nalso facilitated the emancipation of slaves who had purchased their\r\nfreedom and so helped to create the wealthy freedman class.[400] Perfect\r\nfreedom of testamentary disposition, in accordance with the plebeian\r\nform of testament _per aes et libram_, was recognised; while in intestate\r\ninheritance and in guardianship the rights of the _agnati_, common to the\r\nPlebeians, were recognised as prior to those of the _gentiles_; sometimes\r\npeculiar to the Patricians.[401] The freedom of contract, guaranteed\r\nby the Tables, implied the old harsh law of debt; but the penalty was\r\ndefined, the procedure carefully described, and every loophole of escape\r\noffered to the debtor.[402] At the same time usury was severely punished;\r\nten per cent (_unciarium fenus_) was recognised as the legal rate of\r\ninterest, and the usurer who exceeded it was punished more severely than\r\nthe thief and compelled to restore fourfold.[403] The rules of procedure\r\nfor all civil actions were laid down, such as the summons of parties and\r\nwitnesses and the length of the trial. But the law did not reveal the\r\nforms of action; these were still hidden with the pontiffs.\r\n\r\nIn criminal matters the Twelve Tables recognise the old principle of\r\nself-help; a limb was to be given for a limb; but for minor wrongs\r\ncompensation was allowed, and twenty-five asses were full reparation\r\nfor a common assault. But there are survivals of the old religious\r\npenalties; the man who destroyed standing corn was hanged as an offering\r\nto Ceres,[404] and the involuntary homicide could expiate his guilt with\r\nthe _piaculum_ of a ram. The law was heavy on the abuse of freedom of\r\nspeech; for death was the penalty for incantations or libels against\r\na citizen.[405] The same penalty was inflicted on the _judex_ who had\r\naccepted bribes;[406] while for _perduellio_ in the form of “rousing\r\nan enemy against the state or handing over a citizen to the enemy” the\r\ndeath penalty was also enjoined.[407] Reference must have been made to\r\ncriminal procedure since the _quaestores parricidii_ were mentioned in\r\nthe law.[408]\r\n\r\nThe principle of the constitution which guaranteed a fair trial to\r\nthe citizen was upheld; for we have the statement of Cicero that the\r\nTwelve Tables granted the _provocatio_ “from every kind of court and\r\npunishment”[409] In two other particulars they limited the jurisdiction\r\nof the people. It was maintained that no law or criminal sentence (for\r\nthis took the form of a _lex_) should be directed against a private\r\nindividual (_privilegia ne inroganto_), and it was laid down that\r\nno capital sentence could be passed except “by the greatest of the\r\n_comitia_” (_nisi per maximum comitiatum_),[410] i.e. by the assembly\r\nof the centuries. Later interpretation held that this clause struck\r\na blow at the capital jurisdiction of the _concilium plebis_; it is,\r\nhowever, doubtful how far this extraordinary jurisdiction, resting on\r\na religious sanction, could be affected by a law which, as we shall\r\nsee, never treated the Plebs as a political corporation at all. Another\r\nimportant constitutional provision of this code was one which granted the\r\nright of free association. The Twelve Tables, while severely prohibiting\r\nsecret gatherings (_coetus nocturni_)[411] which had presumably\r\ntreasonable designs, permitted the free formation of guilds (_collegia_\r\nor _sodalicia_). Such colleges were to require no special charter; the\r\nrules which they made for their own guidance should be valid, provided\r\nthey were no infringement of the public law.[412] Lastly, the code\r\nguaranteed the sovereignty of the popular assembly by declaring that its\r\nlast enactment should be final, without setting limits to the sphere of\r\nits legislative activity.[413] This was a token of the Roman conviction\r\nthat there should be no finality in law. The Twelve Tables themselves\r\nwere not guarded against repeal. It was a forecast of further development\r\nfollowing the course of the old, of a constitution whose stages were\r\nmarked by elasticity and growth, not by rigidity and revolution.\r\n\r\nThe new law does not appear to have made mention of the Plebs and its\r\ntribunes, for they were hardly a part of the constitution; and yet, in\r\nthe crisis that followed the fall of the decemvirate, the question that\r\ngathered round these ignored powers was great enough to obscure every\r\nother issue.\r\n\r\nThe Plebs might have been satisfied with the compromise, had it not been\r\nfor the unfortunate attempt at despotism made by the second board of\r\ndecemvirs. It is impossible to believe that this usurpation was really\r\ncountenanced by the Patriciate, and that they aimed at staving off\r\nindefinitely the inevitable assaults of the Plebeians on the magistracy\r\nby indefinitely perpetuating this rule of ten annual commissioners\r\nwithout appeal; but they tolerated their rule, and backed up their\r\nexcuses for not retiring, until two acts of tyranny raised mutinies in\r\nboth the Roman camps. The plebeian soldiers cast off their allegiance\r\nto the ruling board, and first, under military leaders of their own\r\nchoosing, occupied the Aventine; they then, accompanied by the majority\r\nof the unarmed Plebeians of Rome, wended their way a second time to the\r\nMons Sacer (449 B.C.). The Senate in alarm sent two of its members,\r\nValerius and Horatius, who were of good repute among the Plebs, to\r\nask their wishes. The answer was: amnesty for the breach of military\r\ndiscipline involved in the secession; the restoration of the _provocatio_\r\n(which meant the dissolution of the decemvirate) and of the tribunician\r\npower.[414] The demands had not increased since the first secession;\r\nprotection was all that the Plebeians yet demanded.\r\n\r\nEverything was granted; the _decemviri_ were forced by the Senate to\r\nan unwilling abdication; the tribunate was re-established, and, as\r\nno plebeian magistrate existed, the unusual step was taken of having\r\nthe election conducted by the _pontifex maximus_.[415] A resolution\r\nwas then elicited from the Plebs by the tribune Duilius that consuls\r\nshould be created subject to the right of appeal. It was accepted by\r\nthe Senate,[416] who appointed an _interrex_. The _comitia_ of the\r\ncenturies returned Valerius and Horatius. Under the guidance of the\r\nconsuls the assembly proceeded to pass a series of laws (the _leges\r\nValeriae Horatiae_) which more than satisfied the demands of the Plebs.\r\nOne guaranteed the perpetuity of the _provocatio_ by the enactment that\r\n“no one should in future create a magistrate from whom there was no\r\nappeal; any one who created such a magistrate should be protected by\r\nno law sacred or profane and might be slain with impunity.”[417] The\r\nlaw was evidently called out by the unlimited power of the decemvirate\r\nwhich had just been abolished; it did more than merely affirm the first\r\n_lex Valeria_,[418] for it rendered the creation of an absolute judicial\r\npower by the _rogatio_ of a magistrate a capital offence, even when this\r\nproposal had been accepted by the people. But the scope of the appeal\r\nwas not extended; the “creation” of a magistrate referred to election\r\nsanctioned by the people, and did not, therefore, affect the right of\r\nthe consul to nominate a dictator from whom there was no appeal; nor did\r\nit extend the limits of the appeal beyond the original boundaries—the\r\n_pomerium_ or, at the utmost, the first milestone from the city.[419]\r\n\r\nTwo other laws aimed at giving a legal existence to the plebeian\r\ncommunity. One gave a legal sanction to the _sacrosanctitas_ of the\r\nplebeian magistrates by enacting that any one who injured them should\r\nbe _sacer_ to the whole community.[420] Another gave a more binding\r\ncharacter to the formal resolutions passed at the _concilium_ of the\r\nPlebs. Its import is obscure, but there can be no doubt that it marks\r\nan important stage in the validity of _plebiscita_. We are told that\r\nit was meant to settle the controverted question whether resolutions\r\nof the Plebs were binding on Patricians;[421] and that it did this by\r\nenacting that “whatsoever the Plebs commanded by its tribes should bind\r\nthe people (_ut, quod tributim plebes jussisset, populum teneret_).” It\r\nis possible that our authority has misunderstood the purport of this law,\r\nbut hardly likely that the misconception is so great as that imagined\r\nby some modern theorists. It is certain that there is no implication\r\nthat _plebiscita_ had from this time the force of _leges_; it was agreed\r\nthat the resolutions of the Plebs did not gain the force of Acts of\r\nParliament until more than 160 years later. Recent attempts to interpret\r\nthe Valerio-Horatian law have been based on the supposition that it was\r\nconcerned with some mode in which a _plebiscitum_ might become a _lex_,\r\nthat it facilitated the transformation of a resolution of the Plebs\r\ninto a binding law of the Populus, through an intermediary channel,\r\nconsuls or Senate.[422] The wording of the law (hardly so remote from\r\nits original as has been supposed) scarcely gives a warrant for this\r\nview; it speaks only of giving a “binding character” to such resolutions.\r\nIt must be remembered that at this time the plebeian community was not\r\nreally bound by the resolutions of its own _concilium_, for this was\r\nnot a legally recognised corporation. The Valerio-Horatian law may\r\nhave made it such, a corporate body passing resolutions binding on all\r\nits members. But a law which is valid for a corporation is valid for\r\nthose outside the corporation. The ordinances, it is true, which have\r\nthis binding force must refer immediately only to the affairs of the\r\ncommunity which dictates them. This was the case with _plebiscita_ now.\r\nAll self-regarding ordinances of the Plebs bound the Plebeians in the\r\nfirst degree, the Patricians, if it infringed existing rights, in the\r\nsecond degree. All _plebiscita_ of a wider scope must still have been\r\nmere petitions to the consuls.[423] We can hardly conceive that the law\r\ndiscriminated accurately between what was possible to the Plebs and what\r\nwas not; it was sufficient to recognise the already established maxim\r\nthat corporations could frame their own rules _dum ne quid ex publica\r\nlege corrumpant_.[424] From this time onwards, down to 287, whenever we\r\nfind _plebiscita_ affecting matters of national interest or creating\r\nchanges in the constitution,[425] we must assume that they were brought\r\nby the magistrates before the people to be ratified as laws; although\r\ndoubtless the undefined limits of plebeian prerogative were often\r\nexceeded.\r\n\r\nThe first great utterance of the Plebs, which followed the\r\nValerio-Horatian law, was one of this character, for it attached a\r\ncriminal (and therefore a public) penalty to a derogation of duty to the\r\nPlebeians. On the proposal of M. Duilius, the tribune, the Plebs resolved\r\nthat “any one who left the Plebs without tribunes or created a (plebeian)\r\nmagistrate without appeal should be scourged and executed.”[426] It\r\nwas a mode by which the Plebs tried to guard itself from any possible\r\nsurrender of its liberties such as that which had created the decemvirate.\r\n\r\nThe Plebs, thus secured in its original privileges, recognised as a\r\ncorporate body, and feeling, as a result of the Twelve Tables, that its\r\nlaw was in the main the law of the state, began to aim at something\r\nmore than protection. From this time begins the continuous struggle\r\nfor the complete equalisation of the two orders. It was opened by the\r\ntribune Canuleius in the year 445. He rightly held that social must\r\nprecede political equality, and proposed in the assembly of the Plebs\r\nthat marriage should be permitted between Patricians and Plebeians.[427]\r\nThe only reasonable objection which the consuls, representing the\r\nfeeling of the Patriciate, could bring forward against the measure, was\r\nthe time-worn pretext that was said to have influenced the decemvirs\r\nin inserting the prohibition in their code, viz. that the Plebeians\r\nhad no auspices, and that the disappearance of a pure race would mean\r\na break in the chain which connected the state with heaven.[428] But\r\nthe pretext expressed the real fears of the Patriciate. Intermarriage\r\nbetween the orders would break down the religious barrier which guarded\r\nthe consulship; this was the prize for which the Plebs was striving. In\r\nfact a suggestion, emanating from the tribunes at the beginning of the\r\nyear, had already assumed the form of a _rogatio_ to the effect that\r\n“the people should have power to choose consuls at its pleasure either\r\nfrom the Plebs or from the _patres_.”[429] Over the marriage question\r\nthe usual contest ensued, and with the usual result. The consuls led\r\nthe opposition as long as they could; at last the Senate was beaten,\r\nthe magistrates were forced to bring the question before the people,\r\nand marriage between the orders was legalised.[430] The tribunes\r\nfollowed up their victory by pressing their measure for the opening\r\nof the consulship. It was felt that open resistance would be useless;\r\nand a device was resorted to which illustrates the Roman genius for\r\nadaptability, for dignified political chicanery, and for satisfying at\r\nthe same time the demands of reason and prejudice. The immediate evil\r\nfelt was the irruption of the Plebeians into supreme office; but there\r\nmust have been for some time a growing sense that the executive machinery\r\nof the state was by no means equal to the demands made on it. The two\r\nconsuls were at once military leaders, the sole administrators of the\r\nhigher civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the sole officials entrusted\r\nwith the duty of registering and distributing burdens over the citizens.\r\nSuch a combination of functions could not continue to exist with the\r\nwidening of Rome’s political horizon, and the first attempt was now made\r\nat a division of the military, judicial, and registrative duties of the\r\nsupreme magistrate.\r\n\r\nTo effect this object, and at the same time to make a concession to\r\nthe Plebs, it was decided to replace the consulship by the office of\r\nmilitary tribune with consular power (_tribunus militum consulari\r\npotestate_).[431] The change, permission for which may have been granted\r\nby a special _lex_,[432] consisted in raising some of the ordinary\r\nlegionary delegates of the consul to a level with the commanding\r\nofficer and suppressing the latter.[433] These extraordinary officials\r\nwere elected at the _comitia centuriata_ under the presidency of one\r\nof the chief magistrates, whether consul or consular tribune, for the\r\ntime being. The normal number, six, was no doubt suggested by the six\r\ntribunes of the old _legio_ or army. But this full number was not always\r\nappointed. The question how many military tribunes should be created\r\nfor a given year depended on the exigencies of the state. Sometimes\r\nthree were elected, sometimes four, at other times six, a number which\r\nseems never to have been exceeded.[434] It rested formally with the\r\nmagistrate who guided the elections, practically perhaps with the Senate,\r\nto determine how many of these officers should be appointed for any\r\ngiven year. As military posts below the supreme command had long been\r\nopened to the Plebs, it goes without saying that Plebeians were eligible\r\nto the consular tribunate; their admission, in fact, had been one of\r\nthe motives of the change.[435] Yet the patrician element was almost\r\nexclusively present in the earlier years of this magistracy, and to\r\nthe end of the office it largely preponderated. Even if we reject the\r\naccount that it was not until forty-five years after the institution of\r\nthe consular tribunate (400 B.C.) that a Plebeian was actually elected\r\nto this post,[436] it is a significant fact that while purely patrician\r\ncolleges are found, there is no instance of one composed exclusively of\r\nPlebeians. This fact may be simply a demonstration of the aristocratic\r\ncharacter of elective office, and shows that the masses preferred the\r\nsafety of the state to the advancement of their own order; for military\r\nskill and experience, and even knowledge of law, were still chiefly to be\r\nsought in the ranks of the _patres_.[437] Gradually, however, the Plebs\r\nbecame familiarised with power and displayed greater trust in the leaders\r\nof their own order. The year 400 does in any case mark a turning point in\r\nthe history of the office. After it we find more Plebeians elected; in\r\n399 and 396 they form a majority of the college, and events were tending\r\nto the demand, which was soon to be made, that a place in the supreme\r\nmagistracy should be reserved for candidates who represented a majority\r\nof the citizens.\r\n\r\nThe power exercised by the consular tribunes was, briefly, that of the\r\nconsuls; they had the same _jus_, _imperium_, and _potestas_,[438] and\r\nthey enjoyed their insignia.[439] They presided over the elections\r\nfor their successors, and took the auspices on these occasions, the\r\nrecognition of a Plebeian’s right to consult the people _auspicato_\r\nbreaking down the last barriers of religious prejudice.[440] If this\r\nmagistracy was considered inferior in dignity to the consulship and only\r\na “shadow” of that high office,[441] it must have been only because it\r\nwas shared by more colleagues, and from a conviction of its occasional\r\ncharacter. Yet it was noted as a curious fact that, from constitutional\r\nreasons unknown even to the early annalists, no consular tribune had ever\r\nenjoyed a triumph.[442]\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that the consulship was in any way abolished\r\nby this exceptional magistracy; it was simply kept in suspense during\r\ncertain years. Each year it was decided afresh whether consuls or\r\nmilitary tribunes should be appointed. Tradition represents the decision\r\nas resting with the Senate;[443] but whether it exercised this function\r\nby law,[444] or merely as the advising body of the magistrate who was to\r\nhold the election, is unknown. This discretionary power shows that the\r\ntribunate was regarded as an exceptional office; but its military and\r\npolitical convenience caused it practically to replace the consulship\r\nduring the years when it was in vogue. The period of the military\r\ntribunate is one of seventy-seven years, extending from 444 to 367. These\r\nyears show twenty-two consular _collegia_, and fifty-one of military\r\ntribunes.[445] The stop-gap lasted for half a century, and the compromise\r\nwas maintained until in 367 a final settlement of the plebeian claim was\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the consulship had been modified in yet another way—one which\r\nwas detrimental to the power of the office, but was meant to preserve\r\ninfluence to the Patriciate. In the institution of the censorship we find\r\nat work the same double motive which had influenced the government in\r\ncreating the consular tribunate—the sense that two men could not manage\r\nall the business of a growing state, and the desire not to share with the\r\nPlebeians the unimpaired powers of the supreme office.\r\n\r\nIt had been the custom for the king, and subsequently for the consuls,\r\nto make an estimate, at certain intervals of time, of the effective\r\nmilitary strength of the state. This was originally a registration of\r\nall the patrician burgesses; but, after the Servian reforms, it became\r\na numbering of all the citizens, for the purpose of discovering those\r\nliable to military service, the class in which they should be enrolled,\r\nand, in case of tribute being imposed, the liability of each household\r\nto the property-tax (_tributum_). For these purposes it was sufficient\r\nfor the heads of families (_patres familiarum_) to be summoned and\r\nquestioned. Their answers formed the record, in accordance with which\r\nmilitary and financial burdens were imposed, and political influence in\r\nthe _comitia centuriata_ was determined. The recognition of citizenship\r\nitself was dependent on this enrolment, for it is probable that from the\r\nearliest times membership of a tribe was the symbol of the possession\r\nof civic rights; while now the fact that the tribe was the basis of the\r\n_concilium plebis_ and the _comitia tributa_ gave a vote to every one\r\nenrolled in one of the _tribus_. The importance which the census had\r\nassumed was not compatible with the consular performance of its duties.\r\nThe judicial and military functions of the annual magistrates interfered\r\nboth with its regularity and its completeness, and the temporary\r\nsuspension of the consulship offered a chance of vesting these duties\r\nin other magistrates. In the year 443 B.C. two new officials, called\r\n_censores_, were created,[446] who were to be elected by the _comitia_\r\nof the centuries. The office was to be confined to the Patriciate,\r\npossibly because it was felt that the solemn ceremony of purification\r\n(_lustratio_) which closed the census could not adequately be performed\r\nby plebeian hands. No one as yet dreamed of the future greatness of the\r\noffice; its beginnings were small,[447] and the tribunes offered no\r\nopposition to the law which established an office which was to become the\r\ngreatest of political prizes.\r\n\r\nThe censorship, though a standing, was in a certain sense an occasional\r\noffice, for the tenure of power by the censors could never have been\r\ncoterminous with the interval between each census—an interval usually\r\nof five years. The original tenure is unknown; possibly the censor\r\nwas supposed to continue in office until his duties were fulfilled.\r\nIt was not until the year 434 B.C. that the censorship was limited to\r\na definite term of a year and a half by a _lex Aemilia_, proposed by\r\nthe dictator Mamercus Aemilius.[448] The censors’ duties were as wide\r\nas the ramifications of the census. His primary function was that of\r\nregistration, but one of the meanings of registration was the imposition\r\nof pecuniary burdens on individuals; hence the censor’s first connexion\r\nwith finance. Another consequence of registration was of still greater\r\nimport. Qualifications of character must always have been considered\r\na necessary condition for the performance of even the meanest public\r\nfunctions at Rome. Admission to the centuries and to the tribes, and\r\ntherefore the exercise of the active rights of voting and serving in\r\nthe army, was possible only to one not stained by crime. The secular\r\nground, one quite sufficient for a self-respecting community, was perhaps\r\nassisted by the religious idea that no impure man should be present at\r\nthe mystic ceremony of purification. Such a testing of character could\r\nhave been performed only in the most cursory way by the consuls. But now\r\nthat a magistracy had been appointed which had leisure for a rigorous\r\nscrutiny, it was inevitable that the rule of manners (_regimen morum_)\r\nshould in time overshadow every other aspect of the censor’s office, and\r\nthat this dual papacy should become the most dignified and dreaded organ\r\nof the state.\r\n\r\nBeyond the establishment of the consular tribunate, the censorship and\r\nthe transference of the election of quaestors to the newly created\r\n_comitia tributa_,[449] the years 449 to 377 are not marked by any\r\ngreat constitutional changes. They were years of compromise but not\r\nof settlement; the restlessness of the reforming party was stayed by\r\nthe constant pressure of war. It could not accuse the military policy\r\nof the governing class, which led its armies to victory and made all\r\nneedful concessions to plebeian talent. It was the epoch of wars with the\r\nAequians, Volscians, and Etruscans, of the siege of Veii, in which Rome\r\nmade her first great territorial conquest, and of the Celtic migrations,\r\nwhich laid Rome in ashes, but made her the bulwark of the central Italian\r\nnations against northern invasions, and gave her strength to remodel\r\nand reform the Latin coalition of which she was the immediate head.\r\nOccasional discontent was at this, as at every other period, excited by\r\nthe need of land distributions and the pressure of debt. Sp. Maelius\r\nfell in 439 and M. Manlius in 384; but the government, though it would\r\nnot have its hand forced, was not wholly unwilling to make concessions\r\nto poverty. The citizen troops on foreign service were given pay in 406,\r\nand the land conquered from Veii was some years later allotted amongst\r\nthe Plebs. While the discontent of the poor was thus kept in check, the\r\ngovernment could afford to make harmless and unavoidable concessions\r\nto Plebeians of higher rank. In 421 the number of quaestors was raised\r\nfrom two to four; for, owing to the prolonged absence of armies, it was\r\nthought fit that a special quaestor should be assigned to each consul\r\nin the field.[450] The tribunes demanded that a fixed proportion of\r\nthese places should be reserved for Plebeians. This was refused, but the\r\ncompromise was arrived at that any of the four places might be filled\r\nfrom the Plebs, a concession which was unavoidable, for the absurdity\r\nof admitting Plebeians to the highest rank in the state and excluding\r\nthem from this subordinate duty must have been felt. The permission did\r\nnot, however, take effect until twelve years later (409 B.C.); but then\r\nPlebeians were returned for three out of four vacancies at the _comitia_\r\nof the tribes.[451] The first regular elective magistracy, however\r\nlimited its powers and dignity, had now been won for the Plebeians.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the provisional government drifted on. It won military\r\nsuccesses; it was gradually building up a hegemony in Italy. But the\r\neffect of war now, as at an earlier period, was ruinous to those to whom\r\nthis government had to look for support. In spite of the palliative\r\nmeasures of pay for the army and occasional land distribution, a large\r\nportion of the yeoman farmers were again in a pitiable state. We cannot\r\nnow speak of the social grievances of Plebeians as a whole; those members\r\nof the Plebs who began to occupy the benches of the Senate,[452] and\r\nwho aspired to the military tribunate or quaestorship, were as wealthy\r\nas their patrician compeers. The race for office was keen between the\r\nmembers of the two orders. The Patrician had now to beg for his place on\r\nthe curule chair. The first law against canvassing (_ambitus_) was passed\r\nin 432; it prohibited a candidate from whitening his toga with chalk\r\nbefore the elections[453]—a primitive measure, but one which shows that\r\nthe plebeian electorate had at last become a power. But though isolated\r\nmembers of the Plebs were soaring into the upper regions, the mass of\r\nthis body still consisted of bankrupt agriculturists. The situation\r\nwhich they regarded as desperate was, apart from the harsh law of debt,\r\nthe normal condition of a modern proletariate. But the ideal of the\r\nancient citizen was higher than our own; they wished to be proprietors of\r\nfreehold land or of land held on an undisturbed tenure from the state.\r\n\r\nThis discontent was the opportunity of the richer Plebeians,[454] who\r\nwished to secure perfect political equality between the orders. In\r\n378 loud cries were raised against the capitalists; a war with the\r\nVolsci gave the tribunes the chance of impeding the military levy, and\r\nsome temporary concessions to debtors were unwillingly wrung from the\r\ngovernment.[455] When the next year saw the burdens reimposed, two\r\nambitious Plebeians, L. Sextius and C. Licinius Stolo, came forward\r\nwith the proposition that the only sure way of permanently remedying\r\nthe evils of the lower class was by securing one of the places in the\r\nconsulship to members of their own order. They formulated a programme\r\nwhich was an attractive jumble of social and political measures. The\r\n_plebiscitum_ which they promulgated promised a temporary relief from\r\ndebt, proposed a limit to the amount of public land which any individual\r\nmight possess, and declared that the military tribunate should be\r\nabolished, the consulship should be restored, and that one of the two\r\nconsuls _must_ henceforth be a Plebeian. This comprehensive measure,\r\nwhich attacked land, capital, and office,[456] was easily met. The two\r\ntribunes stood alone, and their eight colleagues were without difficulty\r\ninduced to put their veto on the revolutionary measure. But it was\r\nsoon shown that, if the veto might be used against the interest of the\r\nPlebs, the negative powers of the tribunes might be employed, with as\r\nmuch legality and as little justification, to paralyse the life of the\r\nstate. The two tribunes, in virtue of the paramount authority which their\r\n_sacrosanctitas_ had in the course of years secured to them, forbade the\r\nelection of any magistrate of the people. For five years successively\r\nLicinius and Sextius were re-elected tribunes; during the whole of this\r\nperiod (375-371) the only magistrates appointed were the plebeian aediles\r\nand tribunes, and the state was without a head. A war with Velitrae led\r\nthe tribunes to relax their anarchical edict for the year 370. But the\r\nlong stand had reduced the number of vetoing tribunes to five. Another\r\nclause was now added to the original proposals to the effect that the\r\ntwo _duumviri sacris faciundis_, the keepers of the sacred books, the\r\nstorehouse which furnished political intrigue with its surest weapons,\r\nshould be raised to ten, and that half of these _decemviri_ should be\r\nPlebeians.[457] None of the tribunes of 368 seems to have been prepared\r\nto offer any effectual resistance to any of the provisions of the\r\nlaw,[458] and the Patricians, driven from their first stronghold, took\r\nrefuge in a dictator. It was a sign that they had lost the game, for the\r\ndictatorship could not be perpetuated. But it required the most strenuous\r\nexertions of the leaders of the Plebs to keep their followers up to the\r\nlevel of their original demands. The spiritless commons who had failed to\r\nelect members of their own order, consular tribunes and quaestors, when\r\nit had been in their power to do so, were for dividing the proposals,\r\npassing the social measures at once and leaving the question of the\r\nconsulship for a future time. But Licinius and Sextius were not prepared\r\nto be social leaders without reward. The only division to which they\r\nsubjected the complicated measure was to carry in 368 the clause sharing\r\nthe new decemvirate with the Plebeians; the other clauses were postponed.\r\nIn the next year, 367 B.C., they were tribunes for the tenth time. The\r\nopposition was worn out, and the Licinio-Sextian laws were passed in\r\ntheir original form. The greatest of plebeian victories had been won;\r\nfrom this time the Plebs is really the dominant element in the state.\r\nIt was of little consequence that it did not assert its omnipotence\r\nfor some years yet; all that it desired further was bound to come. As\r\nthe magistracy was far more powerful than the people at Rome, the body\r\nthat exercised the whole of the highest prohibitive power through the\r\ntribunate, and monopolised half of the highest positive authority in the\r\nconsulship, was bound to be supreme. Even the purely patrician privilege\r\nof the _patrum auctoritas_ was no great disturbance to this power. It\r\nbecame more a matter of form, the more the plebeian element entered into\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\nThe Licinian laws had the unexpected effect of adding two new\r\nmagistracies to the state. These were known as the Praetorship and\r\nthe Curule Aedileship. The institution of the former office was a\r\nconstitutional change of the first magnitude, being nothing less than the\r\naddition of a third colleague to the consuls. It is represented as having\r\nbeen a part of the compromise between the orders, the Plebeians allowing\r\na third purely patrician magistracy to be created in exchange for the\r\nconfiscated consulship.[459] But, even if we assume that the praetorship\r\nwas originally confined to the _patres_—a statement which has with some\r\nreason been doubted[460]—it was necessity rather than ambition which\r\ndirected the creation of the office. The impossibility of the consul’s\r\npaying adequate attention to duties of jurisdiction had been one of the\r\nmotives which led to the establishment of the consular tribunate. Now\r\nthat the consulship was permanently restored, provision had to be made\r\nfor the permanent severance of civil jurisdiction from that office.\r\nAs jurisdiction implied the _imperium_, and all the possessors of\r\nthis regal prerogative were necessarily colleagues, the praetor was a\r\ncolleague of the consuls. He was created, as the phrase ran, “under the\r\nsame auspices,”[461] and therefore by the same assembly and under the\r\nsame formalities of election. He bore the early title of the consuls,\r\nwhich, in spite of its inappropriateness to his usual peaceful duties,\r\ncame to cling to him exclusively. But, though he was needed chiefly\r\nfor purposes of jurisdiction, one branch of the _imperium_ could not\r\nbe singled out to the exclusion of the others. The praetor possesses\r\nall the aspects of the supreme power, the capacity for command in war,\r\nfor initiating legislation, for summoning and transacting business with\r\nthe Senate. How these powers were harmonised with, and subordinated\r\nto, the similar powers of the consuls, will be described elsewhere.\r\nThe main business of the original praetor did not clash with that of\r\nhis colleagues, for, though in theory perhaps the consul never did\r\nlose his control of civil jurisdiction,[462] practice decided against\r\nhis interference with it, and the praetor was for more than 120 years\r\n(366-242) the sole civil magistrate of Rome. At the close of this period\r\na second praetor was appointed, whose duty it was to decide cases between\r\nforeigners (_peregrini_) and between Roman citizens and foreigners—an\r\naddition rendered necessary by the growth of Rome’s territory and\r\nbusiness, and which has no further political significance.\r\n\r\nThe praetorship, if it ever was a patrician preserve, did not long remain\r\nsuch. Thirty years after its institution (337 B.C.) a Plebeian, Q.\r\nPublilius Philo, successfully contested the post. The objections of the\r\npresiding magistrate, whether based on law or custom, were overruled and\r\nPlebeians declared eligible for the office.[463]\r\n\r\nThe appointment, simultaneously with the praetor, of two additional\r\naediles, secured nothing for the Patricians, but a great deal for the\r\nstate. The military duties which prevented the consul from administering\r\njustice and attending to registration, also hindered him from devoting\r\nhimself to the _minutiae_ of police and market regulations. It was an\r\nanomaly that these duties, so far as they fell to the lot of any special\r\nofficials, should be in the hands of two plebeian assistants of the\r\ntribune.[464] It was from them that the two new magistrates borrowed\r\ntheir names, and the similarity of title and functions had the happy\r\nresult of fusing into one corporation the plebeian officials and the\r\nnew magistrates of the community. The latter were known in later times\r\nas _aediles curules_, from the curule chair which they had in common\r\nwith the magistrates vested with the _imperium_. The Patriciate is said\r\nto have been the original condition of eligibility to the office;[465]\r\nbut this was very soon abandoned in favour of the practice that the\r\ncurule aediles should be chosen in alternate years from Patricians and\r\nPlebeians.[466] Later still—at what period is uncertain—the magistracy\r\nwas annually accessible to members of both orders.\r\n\r\nThe accession of Plebeians to the consulship had been the key of the\r\nposition; it had broken down the last pretended religious scruple, and\r\na few years saw the patrician defences of every office overthrown. The\r\nyear 356 witnessed the first plebeian dictator;[467] no law appears to\r\nhave been required to secure the Plebs admission to this office, the\r\nqualification for the consulship being considered _ipso jure_ to open\r\na passage to the dictatorship. In 351 a Plebeian was first admitted to\r\nthe censorship;[468] but mere admissibility was not enough, and in 339\r\none of the laws passed by the plebeian dictator, Q. Publilius Philo,\r\n_reserved_ one of the two places in the censorship for members of his\r\norder.[469] How difficult it would have been for the Plebs to secure\r\nthis office, apart from such a regulation, is shown by the fact that\r\nthe first exclusively plebeian censorship dates only from the year 131\r\nB.C.[470] With respect to the occupation of both of the consular places\r\nby Plebeians, a doubt seems to have existed of its legality, which was\r\nremoved in 342 by a _plebiscitum_ passed into law which declared “uti\r\nliceret consules ambos plebeios creari.”[471] We have already noticed\r\ntheir capture of the praetorship in 337 B.C.\r\n\r\nThere was but one more fort, but that a strong one, which the plebeian\r\n_principes_ had to storm. This was the circle of the priestly colleges.\r\nThe two religious guilds of paramount political importance, apart from\r\nthe decemvirate (_sacris faciundis_) to which Plebeians had been already\r\nadmitted, were those of the pontiffs and augurs. The pontifical college,\r\nwhich in the monarchy had consisted of five members, was now composed of\r\nfour, the place occupied by the expelled king having never apparently\r\nbeen filled up.[472] The augural college, which should have consisted of\r\nsix, was also at this time reduced by some accident to four members.[473]\r\nIn the year 300 B.C. two tribunes, Q. and Cn. Ogulnius, brought forward\r\na bill for raising the number of the augurs to nine, and that of the\r\npontiffs to eight, the added numbers in either case to be taken from the\r\nPlebs.[474] The measure was understood to be primarily in the interest of\r\nthe noble Plebeians, already in possession of curule office and triumphal\r\nornaments, but it did to a large extent assist the rights of the Plebs as\r\na corporation; for the religious veto henceforth, though it might be used\r\nby the nobility against the interests of the lower orders, could not be\r\nemployed by the Patricians to check plebeian measures. The bill, which\r\nbecame law, established the religious equality of the two orders, so far\r\nas religion was a political force. It is true that, as we shall see, the\r\nPlebs were always excluded from certain non-political priesthoods; but,\r\non the other hand, one of the religious colleges of national importance\r\nestablished in later times—the _triumviri epulones_, created in 196\r\nB.C. for preparing the _epulum Jovis_ and banquets given in honour of\r\nthe other gods[475]—seems from its origin to have been composed wholly\r\nof Plebeians.[476] The change, however, though indirectly favourable\r\nto the Plebeians, was not of a democratic character; the priesthoods\r\nwere kept within a few distinguished families through the principle of\r\nappointment. The method was that of cooptation, which we find existing\r\nin 453 B.C.[477] It was not until the last century of the Republic that\r\nthe _lex Domitia_ (104 B.C.) ventured to give the election, not indeed to\r\nthe Populus, but to a special assembly composed of seventeen out of the\r\nthirty-five tribes chosen by lot, and even then the forms of nomination\r\nby the head of the college, and of cooptation by its members, were\r\nscrupulously observed.[478]\r\n\r\nIn sketching the invasion of office and honours by the plebeian nobles\r\nwe have ventured to anticipate somewhat the chronological sequence of\r\nevents. The commons, too, had during this period their share of political\r\nemancipation. Thirty-nine years before the Ogulnian law something had\r\nbeen done by legislation to increase the independence of the Plebs as a\r\ncorporation, and to free the assemblies of the Populus from the legal\r\ncontrol of the Patricians. In 339 B.C. a plebeian dictator, Q. Publilius\r\nPhilo, carried a law making _plebiscita_ binding on the people (_ut\r\nplebiscita omnes Quirites tenerent_).[479] The meaning of this law was\r\nclearly not understood by our authority. Its pretended wording is almost\r\nidentical with that of the Valerio-Horatian measures;[480] but what was\r\ndone on that occasion did not need repetition, and the object of the\r\nPublilian law must have been to secure more immediate legal validity to\r\nsuch measures passed by the Plebs as did not refer to that corporation\r\nalone—to make, in fact, the stages of transition from _plebiscitum_ to\r\n_lex_ a matter of formal and not of real importance.[481] Another law\r\npassed by the same dictator had reference to the _patrum auctoritas_.\r\nWe have seen what this power had become, probably from the dawn of the\r\nRepublic.[482] It was a claim by the patrician members of the Senate to\r\naccept or reject any measure of the Populus, when assembled by curies\r\nor by centuries. It never affected _plebiscita_, and we know too little\r\nof the _comitia tributa_ to say whether the measures of that body were\r\nsubmitted to it or not;[483] the hampering of the _comitia curiata_ was\r\nby this time of no importance, and the _lex Publilia_ confined itself\r\nto the application of the _auctoritas_ to the centuries. By this law it\r\nwas enacted that the consent to laws passed by the _comitia centuriata_\r\nshould be given before the voting commenced.[484] This provision was\r\nshortly afterwards (perhaps in 338 B.C.) extended by a _lex Maenia_ to\r\nelections.[485] It is evident that neither of these provisions could\r\nhave made the _auctoritas_ nugatory, for it was not more difficult for a\r\nsection of the Senate to decline to submit a question to the people than\r\nto reject it when passed. The provisions may, however, be a sign that the\r\n_auctoritas_ was becoming a mere form; but its formal character was due\r\nto the rapidly increasing preponderance of Plebeians in the Senate.\r\n\r\nBut though the popular assemblies were thus free from patrician control,\r\nand the magistrates, subject only to the self-imposed limitation of\r\ntaking advice from the Senate, could elicit any utterance they pleased\r\nfrom the _comitia_, there was one grave defect in the existing system\r\nof legislation which called for remedy. The plebeian magistracy, which\r\ncircumstances had raised to a pre-eminence above all other powers,\r\nhad not the freedom of the other magistrates. The _rogationes_ of the\r\ntribunes, when accepted by the Plebs, still required some further\r\nsanction to become laws. This anomaly might have been remedied in one\r\nof two ways; either by giving the tribune the right of summoning and\r\npresiding over meetings of the people, making him in fact a magistrate\r\nof the community, and thus abolishing all distinction between Populus\r\nand Plebs, or removing the impediments which still hampered tribunician\r\nlegislation in the _concilium plebis_. The conservatism of the Roman\r\ncharacter, and perhaps the class feeling reviving again at the beginning\r\nof the third century in consequence of a renewed outbreak of the Plebs,\r\ncaused the latter course to be adopted. In the year 287 the commons,\r\noppressed by debt, again seceded—this time to the Janiculum. The plebeian\r\ndictator appointed to effect a settlement met social grievances by a\r\npolitical concession. He passed a law which most of our authorities\r\nrepresent as verbally identical with the Valerio-Horatian and Publilian\r\nlaws,[486] but which seems to have been of a very different and far\r\nmore definite character. The lawyers[487] regard the _lex Hortensia_\r\nas the measure which gave decrees of the Plebs the full force of laws.\r\nHenceforth there is between _lex_ and _plebiscitum_ merely a difference\r\nof form and name; their _potestas_ is the same,[488] and even legal\r\nformulae use the words as practically identical.[489] A law could repeal\r\na plebiscite and a plebiscite a law;[490] in the case of a conflict\r\nbetween the two, the rule of the Twelve Tables held good that the later\r\nrepealed the earlier ordinance. It is not, therefore, surprising to\r\nfind that in the annalists, even those with pretensions to accuracy,\r\nPopulus and Plebs are used indifferently,[491] and it is only at times\r\nby carefully noting who is the presiding magistrate on the particular\r\noccasion, that we can determine whether the ordinance he elicits is\r\na decree of the _comitia_ or the _concilium_. The difference in the\r\nlegislative powers of the two assemblies came in course of time to be\r\nlittle more than a difference in magisterial right;[492] while the\r\n_comitia_ of the centuries and tribes were presided over by magistrates\r\nwith the _imperium_, the _concilium_ of the Plebs could be summoned\r\nand addressed only by plebeian magistrates. Yet the past history of\r\nthe various assemblies was decisive as to their elective and judicial\r\nfunctions, and practice tended still further to fix the scope of the\r\npowers of each. But at the time of the _lex Hortensia_ the difference\r\nbetween the two parliamentary sovereigns—the Populus and the Plebs—was\r\neven more marked; for the Patricians, excluded from the _concilium_,\r\nwere still a considerable body, and the tribune had not yet become, like\r\nthe magistrates with _imperium_, quite a servant of the Senate.[493]\r\nThe Hortensian law had at the time a political significance which\r\nit afterwards lost; but it had a hidden import which was of vital\r\nconsequence for the history of the state. By perpetuating the Plebs as\r\na separate corporation it preserved the tribunate in all its primitive\r\nmajesty, and thus maintained the power subsequently to be used as an\r\ninstrument of senatorial and monarchical rule.\r\n\r\nThe tendencies of plebeian emancipation were almost all in favour of\r\nthe upper classes; that it never was a democratic movement or one led\r\nby democratically-minded men is most strikingly evidenced by the utter\r\nindifference shown by the leaders to the economic evils under which the\r\nmasses laboured, and which they used as instruments to further their\r\nambition. Solon abolished slavery for debt at a single stroke; to the\r\nRoman it is a sacred thing, an expression of _Romana fides_; while\r\nthe Greek προστάτης struggled for others, the Roman patron fought for\r\nhimself. But continued pressure caused some tentative efforts to be made\r\nin the latter half of the fourth century to mitigate the curse of debt.\r\nA _lex Marcia_ of 352 B.C. gave the debtor the right of summary arrest\r\n(_manus injectio_) of the usurer, to recover the fourfold penalty for\r\nthe illegal interest;[494] while in 326 an attempt was made to give the\r\nfuture masters of the world the mastery over their bodies. In 313 a _lex\r\nPoetilia_ was passed forbidding the imprisonment of _nexi_ who could\r\nswear that they had reasonable hopes of ultimately satisfying their\r\ncreditors;[495] it therefore abolished most contracts on the security of\r\nthe person; although the _addictio_ and imprisonment of debtors by order\r\nof the court continued through the Republic and into the Empire. But if\r\nthe harshness of the law was one evil, ignorance of its forms was another\r\nalmost equally great. An accident supplied the remedy. The pontiff Appius\r\nClaudius had reduced the forms of action to writing; but the book meant\r\nfor the guidance of the pontiffs was immediately revealed to the profane\r\neyes of the people by his clerk, one Cn. Flavius, a freedman’s son. The\r\nfraudulent secretary also posted up a tablet containing a list of court\r\ndays (_dies fasti_) on which the _legis actio_ was possible.[496] The\r\n_penetralia_ of the pontifical college had now become the property of the\r\nmasses, and although the chief pontiffs still furnished for centuries\r\nthe highest names to Roman law, they professed the science openly,[497]\r\nand secular teaching soon tore the veil from the hidden features of\r\njurisprudence.\r\n\r\nBut, apart from these minor benefits, the mass of the Plebeians did not\r\nshare to any very large extent in the triumph of their order. The true\r\nreason of the individual Roman being thus thrust into the background\r\ncan only be given by a review of the causes, soon to be treated, which\r\nmoulded both the theory and practice of the developed Roman constitution.\r\nIt must suffice here to trace the painfully inadequate results which were\r\nsecured by these centuries of agitation by a glance at the distribution\r\nof power in the Roman state, at the date of the war with Pyrrhus, or the\r\noutbreak of the struggle with Carthage.\r\n\r\nThe old nobility had relaxed its exclusive hold of office, but only to\r\ngive room for the still firmer grasp of a new. This was an aristocracy\r\nof mixed origin, composed indifferently of the leading patrician and\r\nplebeian families. The test of _nobilitas_ was the capacity to point to\r\nancestors who had held office which carried with it the right to sit on\r\nthe curule chair. Its outward sign was the possession of the so-called\r\n_jus imaginum_. The _imagines_ themselves were portrait-masks in wax,\r\nmodelled from the face of the dead, and their primary use was for the\r\npurpose of funeral ceremonies. The original was moulded to be placed\r\non the face of the deceased, and so to perpetuate his life in another\r\nworld; but a copy was kept to give verisimilitude to his fictitious\r\nresurrection, which the burial of one of his descendants demanded. At\r\nsuch funerals actors were hired to represent the mighty dead; they wore\r\ntheir _imagines_, and were adorned with the insignia of the offices which\r\nthese had filled in life, with the _toga praetexta_ of the consul or\r\npraetor, the purple robe or the _toga picta_ of the censor, and they sat\r\non curule chairs round the Forum to listen to the orator who reminded\r\nthem of their own great deeds.[498] As such a public funeral in the Forum\r\nwas a concession of the state, the prospective right of having one’s mask\r\nexhibited, which constituted the _jus imaginum_, was a strictly legal\r\nprivilege. It was possessed by all those who had been in possession of\r\nthe _toga praetexta_ and the _sella curulis_[499]—the dictator, master of\r\nthe horse, consul, censor, praetor, and curule aedile. But, even apart\r\nfrom the occasions of such solemn mummery, the _imago_ was a sign of the\r\nrank of its possessor. When not funereally employed it was suspended on\r\na bust in the wings of the central hall (_atrium_) of the noble’s house.\r\nBeneath each portrait ran an inscription (_titulus_ or _elogium_), which\r\ngave the names and deeds of the person represented. The portraits were\r\njoined by lines along the walls which showed the _stemma_ or family\r\ntree. It is possible that this display in the _atrium_ was looked on as\r\na public exhibition, and it may originally have been limited by law; but\r\nin later times it seems best to conclude that the funerary exhibition\r\nalone was the subject of the specific _jus_.[500] But this outward token\r\nof nobility, which at Rome took the place of the modern title of honour,\r\nwas of importance as emphasising the distinction between the _nobiles_\r\nand the _ignobiles_, in drawing the plebeian aristocracy closer to\r\nthe patrician, which before the date of the Licinian laws had been in\r\nexclusive possession of this right, and in asserting the hereditary claim\r\nto office which the Roman electorate was only too ready to recognise.\r\nThe acceptance of the claim was less dangerous than it is in most modern\r\nstates, since primogeniture was not recognised in the transmission of\r\nhonours,[501] and it was the capable and not the elder son whom the\r\nvote of the _comitia_ raised to the curule chair. The claim too might\r\nbecome dimmed by disuse, and the Plebeian whose immediate ancestors had\r\nheld high rank showed a brighter scutcheon than the Patrician who was\r\nconnected with a noble _stemma_ by ignoble links.[502] But the Patriciate\r\nitself conferred a kind of nobility, and one that, whatever its basis,\r\nmight have been justified by office, for there could have been few\r\nmembers of the order who could not point to curule ancestors in the past.\r\nAlthough the Plebeian who _first_ secured curule office, and thus ceased\r\nto be _ignobilis_, was called a _novus homo_, the designation seems\r\nnever to have been applied to the member of a patrician _gens_.[503]\r\nNobility, if once secured, could never be lost; but the hereditary claim\r\nto the suffrage of the electors was of little avail if unaccompanied by\r\nexceptional merit or by wealth. The claims of the latter were in fact\r\ngiven a kind of legal recognition by the rule established about the time\r\nof the first Punic war, that the cost of the public games should not\r\nbe defrayed exclusively by the treasury.[504] The aedileship, whether\r\ncurule or plebeian, was, as we shall see, not an obligatory step in the\r\nascending scale of the magistracies; but, as it was held before the\r\npraetorship and the consulship, it is obvious that the brilliant display\r\ngiven to the people by the occupant of this office would often render\r\nfruitless the efforts of his less fortunate competitors, and that this\r\nlegitimised bribery would exclude from office both the poorer _nobiles_\r\nand the struggling _novus homo_.[505]\r\n\r\nThe idea of a privileged nobility, which closed its ranks to new men,\r\nhad become fixed by the date of the second Punic war.[506] By the close\r\nof that war the old stock had reached its maturity and had begun to\r\ndecline; and, although men like Cato or Cicero might force themselves to\r\nthe front by pertinacity and ability, or the belief in privilege might\r\nbe rudely shaken by the people’s thrusting into the coterie a Varro or\r\na Marius, the aristocrats came to look on the introduction of new blood\r\nas a pollution to the order.[507] Time, which purifies all things, had\r\nmade the slave-blood of the successful Plebeian as blue as that of the\r\ndescendant of kings by whom he sat.\r\n\r\nBut, in spite of this unholy alliance of the ancient foes, the\r\ndistinction between the orders never was abolished. In Cicero’s time\r\nthe separate rights of the Patricians could still be enumerated and\r\ndefended by the orator. Besides the shadowy and ineffective powers of\r\nthe _patrum auctoritas_ and the _interregnum_, they possessed half the\r\nplaces in the great priestly colleges, which were shared between the\r\norders, and certain priests—the Rex Sacrorum, the three great Flamines\r\nand the Salii—were chosen exclusively from their ranks.[508] The place\r\nof the Patriciate in the theory of the constitution—as illustrated by\r\nthe _auctoritas_ and the _interregnum_—is, as we shall see, very great\r\nindeed; but this theoretical importance conferred very little power, and\r\nthe Plebeians, with their exclusive magistracies closed to the _patres_,\r\nwith one place reserved for them in the consulship and censorship and the\r\nother accessible to their order, had won in the long race for honours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE CLASSES OF THE POPULATION AND THE THEORY OF THE CONSTITUTION IN THE\r\nDEVELOPED REPUBLIC\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. _The Classes of the Population_\r\n\r\nBy the date of the _lex Hortensia_ (287 B.C.) the Republican constitution\r\nhad, in all essential points (considered as the constitution of a\r\ncity-state), completed its growth; but, before we proceed to examine the\r\ntheory and practice of the developed polity, it is necessary to pause\r\nand inquire what changes these centuries of Republican development had\r\nmade in the status of the citizen, and in that of the other classes of\r\nthe city, who shared partially in, or were excluded from, his rights, and\r\nwhat modifications had been undergone by the few main legal rules which\r\nmark the outline of their social environment.\r\n\r\nThe merging of Patricians and Plebeians into one community created the\r\nnecessity for a universal conception of citizenship applicable to the\r\nwhole body which possessed active political rights, while the growing\r\npractice of granting partial civic rights to the members of certain\r\nItalian communities led to the distinction between the fully-privileged\r\nand the partially-privileged citizen. The former is the _civis optimo\r\njure_, the latter the _civis non optimo jure_. It is only of the former\r\nthat we shall speak here; the consideration of the latter will be more\r\nappropriately deferred to that portion of our work which treats of the\r\nItalian confederation.\r\n\r\nThe normal mode of the acquisition of citizenship was naturally birth,\r\neither from two citizens or from a citizen and a foreigner. The question\r\nof the necessity of the marriage of the parents for the full citizenship\r\nof the children we shall soon consider; the primary question that\r\npresents itself to a nation is that of the allegiance of the child who\r\nis the product of a citizen and a foreigner. In such a case the older\r\nprinciple of Roman law (an instance probably of a universal principle\r\nof Italian law) was that, where _conubium_ existed between the parents,\r\nthe children followed the status of the father; where _conubium_ did\r\nnot exist, nature dictated that they should follow the condition of the\r\nmother.[509] But an arbitrary exception to this principle was made at\r\nan unknown date in Roman law by a _lex Minicia_ which enacted that, in\r\ncase of unions without _conubium_ between a Roman and a foreigner, the\r\nchildren should follow the status of the less privileged parent; the\r\nchild of a _civis Romana_ by a _peregrinus_ was, therefore, himself a\r\n_peregrinus_.\r\n\r\nThe exceptional modes by which citizens were created were (i.)\r\nstate-conferment of the _civitas_ on _peregrini_ or of full _civitas_ on\r\n_cives non optimo jure_, and (ii.) the manumission of slaves.\r\n\r\n(i.) State-conferment of the _civitas_ was only an exceptional measure in\r\nso far as it required a special legislative act.[510] The extraordinary\r\nliberality of Rome in this respect, never equalled in the life of the\r\nancient city-state—a liberality which spread the name of Roman citizen\r\nfirst over Italy and then over the greater part of the civilised\r\nglobe—was not an outcome of any suddenly adopted policy, but persisted\r\nfrom the birth of the city[511] to the world-embracing edict of Caracalla\r\n(212 A.D.). A few figures are sufficient to represent the extent of\r\nthe increase effected by this means. The male citizens who appeared on\r\nthe census rolls were, at the close of the first Punic war (240 B.C.),\r\n260,000; in 124 they had risen to 394,726; in 85, after the incorporation\r\nof the greater part of Italy, to 963,000.[512] Under Augustus (28 and 8\r\nB.C. and 14 A.D.) the figures were 4,063,000, 4,233,000, and 4,937,000;\r\nand the census of Claudius (47 A.D.) gave a return of 5,984,072 _civium\r\ncapita_.[513]\r\n\r\nThis gift of citizenship was, in the Republic, conferred exclusively by\r\na decree of the people (_jussu populi_). Such decrees might be either\r\nof a standing or a particular character; they might confer the gift\r\nimmediately on the recipients or through intermediary delegates. Standing\r\nrules are mainly such as governed the condition of the dependencies\r\nof Rome. We shall find that the rights of Latin colonies provided\r\nfacilities for the attainment of citizenship; the criminal laws sometimes\r\ngave a foreigner the gift of _civitas_ as a reward for successful\r\nprosecution;[514] and, after the fall of the Republic, the enlistment of\r\nlegionaries from the provinces was one of the most fertile sources from\r\nwhich the citizen body was recruited. Particular conferments, if not made\r\ndirectly by the people, might be effected through the Senate acting as\r\nits delegate,[515] or through commissioners charged with the founding of\r\ncolonies. These were generally the specially-appointed _IIIviri coloniae\r\ndeducendae_; and in all such cases of delegation the power was conferred\r\nby a _lex_.[516] In the last century of the Republic we find the custom\r\ngrowing up of permitting by special enactment such powers to generals in\r\nthe field. Marius in the Cimbric war had the gift of citizenship in his\r\nhands, and a _lex Cornelia Gellia_ granted a similar power to Pompeius\r\nduring his Spanish campaigns.[517] This was the stepping stone to the\r\nright possessed by the sole commander-in-chief, the Princeps, to confer\r\nthe citizenship at his pleasure.\r\n\r\n(ii.) Any perfectly valid form of manumission conferred citizenship on\r\nslaves. Every form was undertaken at the initiative of the master, but\r\nfor it to be perfectly sound (_manumissio justa_)[518] he must observe\r\ncertain rules of law. The most usual form was the _manumissio vindicta_.\r\nIt was one of the many fictitious forms of the old capture of property\r\n(_vindicatio_), the primitive Roman method of recovery. A man of straw,\r\ncalled the _adsertor in libertatem_, appeared before any magistrate, who\r\ncould claim the conduct of the _legis actio_[519] declared the slave to\r\nbe free, and touched his head with a staff (_vindicta_).[520] The master\r\nyielded, and this cession of his rights (_in jure cessio_) was followed\r\nby the declaration of the magistrate that the slave was free.[521]\r\n\r\nThe second form was the enrolment on the register of citizens by the\r\ncensor, when the census was in progress, at the request of the master\r\n(_manumissio censu_). It was the false declaration of the master that the\r\nman was free which gave validity to this form.[522]\r\n\r\nThe third and later form was manumission by testament (_manumissio\r\ntestamento_), by which the master either commanded the freedom of the\r\nslave in his will, or left it as a trust to his heir.[523]\r\n\r\nThe comparative inconvenience of these forms had led to other simpler\r\nmodes of manumission—by announcement of the freedom before friends\r\n(_inter amicos_), or through a letter to the slave bidding him live as a\r\nfreeman (_per epistolam_), or even by inviting him to dine as a freeman\r\nat his master’s table (_per mensam_).[524] Manumission effected in this\r\ninformal way, though protected by the civil courts, did not confer the\r\npolitical rights of citizenship.\r\n\r\nThe citizen who was made such by manumission was a _libertinus_; all\r\nothers were, at the close of the Republic, free-born (_ingenui_). The\r\ndistinction conferred by _ingenuitas_ was, as we shall see, an important\r\none, since this condition was a requisite for the army, the magistracy,\r\nand the higher orders (_ordines_) of the state. But the conception of\r\n“free birth,” though a simple one at the end of the Republic, is one that\r\nhas had a history, and _ingenuitas_ did not at all times bear the same\r\nmeaning. At the end of the fourth century B.C. an _ingenuus_ was one who\r\nwas sprung, not merely from free but from free-born ancestors, for the\r\nterm _libertinus_—always its antithesis—was used to cover, not merely the\r\nmanumitted slave, but his descendant in the first degree.[525] Before\r\nthe close of the Republic the son of a freedman or of a freed-woman was\r\n_ingenuus_, the only condition being “birth in a state of freedom.”[526]\r\nThe status of the mother alone was taken into consideration, that of the\r\nfather being neglected, and the condition of marriage, which could not be\r\ntaken into account if one of the parents was unfree, was necessarily not\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nLegal marriage must in early times have been a condition of _ingenuitas_\r\nin the plebeian, as it certainly was in the ancient patrician community.\r\nBut before the close of the Republic this condition too was disregarded,\r\nand illegitimate children (_spurii filii_) were placed on a level, as\r\nregards honours and offices, with those born from wedlock.[527] It was\r\none of the many triumphs of the law of nature over the law of the state.\r\n\r\nThe rights (_jura_) of the citizen in the developed Republic were\r\nthose which we have enumerated as belonging to the free Plebeian of\r\nthe monarchy,[528] with most of the exclusively patrician privileges\r\nadded. They included the rights of marriage and of commerce, with their\r\nconsequences, the _patria potestas_ and the right of making testaments,\r\nand in addition, the power of occupying domain land and the rights\r\nof suffrage and of office. The Patricians still possessed some minor\r\nprivileges,[529] and the old theory was still upheld which reserved\r\nthe _auspicia_ for the _patres_. But, with Plebeians in possession of\r\nthe _imperium_, this doctrine was maintained by the fiction which gave\r\nthe occupant of a “popular” and, as it still continued to be called,\r\n“patrician” magistracy the patrician _auspicatio_.\r\n\r\nThe duties of the citizen are certain services which he owes to the\r\nstate, which are paid either by his personal labour or by his property.\r\n\r\nThe name for these duties (_moenera_, _munera_, connected with _munire_,\r\nto “fortify”) shows that they were connected with the military defence\r\nof the city. Originally most of such burdens were probably defrayed by\r\nthe personal labour of the citizens.[530] Even the financial burdens\r\nwhich afterwards pressed on property (_munera patrimonii_) were largely\r\ndefrayed by their enforced toil (_operae_).[531] In the municipal\r\nlegislation of the close of the Republic we find the services of the\r\ncitizens demanded for imposts such as the repair of roads and walls\r\n(_munitio_), which are in modern times covered by rates.[532] But the\r\n_tributum_, at whatever time it was first imposed, came to satisfy most\r\nof the necessities formerly met by this enforced labour. Other public\r\nneeds were, in the Republic, met by contracts concluded by the censor, of\r\nwhich we shall speak in connexion with that office. A clear distinction\r\ncould now be drawn between the great burden on property—the tribute—and\r\nthe great burden on the person—military service.[533]\r\n\r\nThe tribute was, from the time of the Servian census, imposed on the\r\nproperty which formed the basis of the _classes_—originally, therefore,\r\non _res mancipi_;[534] later it was levied on all property and was paid\r\nby all registered citizens who were _sui juris_, the aes _hordearium_ and\r\n_equestre_ for the support of the knights being still paid by children\r\nand women who were also _sui juris_.[535] The lowest property taxed\r\nwas, as we have seen, one of 1500 asses.[536] The taxation was not,\r\nhowever, like military service, graduated according to the _classes_,\r\nbut was collected uniformly, usually at a rate of one _as_ in the 1000\r\n(⅒ per cent). The tribute was an extraordinary tax and was imposed, like\r\nmilitary service, only when the necessities of the state demanded it,\r\npractically when there was no reserve fund in the _aerarium_. The state\r\nregarded it as a loan rather than as its due, and sometimes considered\r\nitself bound, when its finances were more flourishing, to return the\r\nmoney to the contributors.[537] The vast revenues accruing to the state\r\nas a result of the third Macedonian war in 167 B.C. caused the cessation\r\nof the tribute,[538] and no further direct tax was collected at Rome\r\nuntil at the end of the third century A.D. it was reimposed by Diocletian\r\nand Maximian. Tribute was, indeed, inconsistent with Rome’s imperial\r\nposition. It had been meant to defray the cost of the legions, but, with\r\nthe creation of the empire, each province defrayed the expenses of its\r\nown military occupation.\r\n\r\nService in the legions (_militia_) was in theory a burden; exemptions\r\nfrom it were occasionally granted as though it were a troublesome\r\nduty,[539] and the citizen who did not present himself for the\r\nconscription was sold as a slave[540] across the Tiber.[541] But the\r\ntreatment of the levy and the feeling of the citizens raised this burden\r\n(_munus_) into a privilege (_honor_); it was for this reason that free\r\nbirth was always required as a qualification for a legionary, and that\r\nthe ranks were never tainted by the admission of men of servile blood.\r\nThe Servian census was still the scale by which military service was\r\nmeasured, both in the _legio_ and in the select corps of citizen cavalry\r\n(_equites_). The legal duration of service throughout the greater part\r\nof the Republic was sixteen, or at the most twenty yearly campaigns\r\n(_stipendia_) for the foot soldier, and ten campaigns for the knight.\r\nThe performance of the _munera_ of tribute and military service required\r\na third duty, which was the condition of both. This was the presence\r\nof the citizen who was _sui juris_ at the census for the purpose of\r\nregistration. All who neglected this duty (the _incensi_) could be sold\r\nas slaves across the Tiber.[542]\r\n\r\nThe concepts of the individual as the subject of rights, of their tenure\r\nand of their infringement, gave rise to a gradually developed theory of\r\nthe _jura_ with which the citizen was invested, and the mode in which\r\nthey might be lost, which plays a large part in the speculations of\r\nthe jurists. It attached itself to the primitive idea of a _capitis\r\ndeminutio_, the lessening of status caused by the loss of family\r\nrights.[543] Gradually jurisprudence evolved the idea of a _caput_ or\r\npersonality possessed by every individual independent of citizenship, an\r\nidea running parallel with the conception of a law of the civilised world\r\n(_jus gentium_) independent of the _jus civile_. From this point of view\r\nloss of _citizenship_ could be spoken of as a _capitis deminutio_. There\r\nwas besides an infringement of personality greater even than the loss of\r\ncitizenship of which the natural man might be the victim. This was the\r\nloss of freedom. These two great derogations of _caput_ were spoken of as\r\n_magna capitis deminutio_;[544] but finally a more precise classification\r\ngave the following three grades of loss of status:[545]—\r\n\r\n(i.) _Capitis deminutio maxima_ was the loss of _civitas_ and _libertas_,\r\nconsequent on a man’s becoming a prisoner of the enemy. With the loss\r\nof freedom, political and therefore private rights[546] ceased _ipso\r\njure_ to exist. The obligations of international law might also produce\r\nthis condition; the Roman general who concluded a treaty with the enemy,\r\nwhich the people would not accept, was handed over as a scapegoat for the\r\nbroken faith of the community[547] (_deditus_), and similar treatment\r\nwas meted out to one who had violated the sanctity of envoys,[548] or\r\nto a general who had made war with a state in alliance with Rome.[549]\r\nThis loss of status was also produced by the civil law, in so far as it\r\nenjoined slavery as a penal measure—e.g. in the case of the _incensi_ or\r\nof those who shirked military service[550]—or permitted the sale of the\r\ndebtor or of the child into a foreign land.[551]\r\n\r\n(ii.) _Capitis deminutio media_ (or _minor_[552]) was the loss of\r\n_civitas_ alone.\r\n\r\nThis might be voluntarily incurred by the assumption of the citizenship\r\nof another town, for the principle of the older Roman law was that a man\r\nmight not be a member of two independent communities.[553] The exile\r\nfrom Rome which followed condemnation for a criminal offence was of\r\nthis type of rejection of citizenship, for the exile was always assumed\r\nto be a voluntary act. Enforced abstention from the Roman _civitas_,\r\nwhich necessitated a continuance in exile, was produced by the decree of\r\noutlawry (_aquae et ignis interdictio_)[554] often passed by the people\r\nagainst an individual who was in voluntary banishment for a crime.\r\n\r\n(iii.) _Capitis deminutio minima_—originally a loss of family rights—was\r\nimproperly construed by the later jurists as a change of family\r\nstatus.[555] Its applications have been already considered.[556]\r\n\r\nThere were means of recovering the status lost in either of these\r\nthree modes. The loss of _familia_ in its original sense[557] might\r\nbe recovered by emancipation; the loss of _civitas_, if enforced by\r\nthe state, by a special act repealing this disability (the _restitutio\r\nin integrum_ of the criminal law). _Libertas_ could be regained by\r\nthe exercise of a right known as the _jus postliminii_. The return,\r\nunintentional or premeditated, of the captive within the limits of his\r\nown country destroyed the state of bondage, and restored the _ingenuitas_\r\nand the rights of the former prisoner. Although described as a legal\r\nfiction[558] it was a direct consequence of the simple principle that a\r\nRoman could not be enslaved on Roman soil.\r\n\r\nThe Roman family had been subjected to many modifications since we\r\nlast considered it.[559] The _patria potestas_, indeed, existed in\r\nall its old rigour, and the power of life and death over the children\r\nstill found occasional expression; but the unity of the family had been\r\nlargely dissolved by the laxity of the marriage tie. A modification of\r\nthe _usus_ marriage had come into vogue, which recognised the consent\r\nof the parties, without the prescriptive tenure by which the _potestas_\r\nwas asserted, as the only bond—one, therefore, dissoluble at any moment\r\nby rejection on the part of the husband or by mutual consent. The\r\nwife remained a member of her father’s _familia_, and if she was _sui\r\njuris_, retained her own property; for the tutelage of women was out of\r\naccordance with the spirit of the age, and, though not abolished, was\r\nevaded by cunningly contrived legal fictions.[560] Never, perhaps, have\r\nwomen been freer from social trammels and legal bonds than they were in\r\nthe last century and a half of the Republic, and one of the features\r\nof their independence was an indirect, but very powerful, influence on\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest change in Roman society was due to the growth of a slave\r\npopulation, which, in the city and that part of Italy which formed the\r\nRoman domain, reduced the free citizens to a minority.\r\n\r\nThe rules of the _jus gentium_—which in this instance, as in many others,\r\nis pure international law—permitted the captive to be enslaved until such\r\ntime as he set foot again in his native land, if this country of his were\r\nan independent state.[561] This principle, applied to the victorious\r\nwars of Rome, had flooded Italy with specimens of various nationalities\r\nwhich were applied to various uses. These prisoners of war were, as a\r\nrule, immediately transferred from the ownership of the state to that of\r\nprivate individuals. They were sold by the quaestors,[562] often in the\r\ncamp,[563] and the slave-dealer tracked the footsteps of a successful\r\ngeneral.[564] War alone might have provided all that were needed for the\r\nmost luxurious community, if we may judge from the result of the second\r\nconquest of Macedon, which swept 150,000 Epirot captives into Italy,[565]\r\nand from the consequences of the campaigns of Caesar and Lucullus. But it\r\nwas supplemented by a brisk slave trade, which after the fall of Corinth\r\nand Carthage (146 B.C.) centred at Delos, and which at the close of\r\nthe Republic had reached such dimensions that, during the reign of the\r\nCilician pirates, 10,000 slaves are said to have been imported and sold\r\nthere in the course of a single day.[566] It was chiefly from the latter\r\nsource that the versatile natives of the East were brought, Phrygians,\r\nMysians, Lydians, Lycians, Paphlagonians, the Hellenised members of the\r\n“nations born to slavery,” who, while professing to interpret, often\r\nguided and controlled, the wills of their slower Roman masters.\r\n\r\nTheir use was twofold; they were either labourers in the workshop and the\r\nfield, or domestic members of the villa or the palace, and their presence\r\nin either capacity was fraught with important political consequences\r\nfor Rome. Their cultivation of the mechanical arts and crafts made the\r\nRoman noble’s household self-sufficient[567] and the competition of the\r\nfree artisan almost a hopeless task. In the country they were gradually\r\nreplacing both the free labourer and the yeoman farmer. The advantage of\r\ncheap labour, which could not be snatched from the master’s hands by the\r\nneeds of distant wars, was at an early period recognised by the nobles\r\nin the cultivation of their vast estates.[568] After the acquisition of\r\nthe province of Sicily, which supplied cheap food to Rome, slave labour\r\non the large estates became an economic necessity; for it was the only\r\ncondition on which corn could now be productively grown. The lot of the\r\nplantation slave, unknown to his master and exposed to the mercies of\r\nthe overseer, was a shameful parody of the earlier domestic servitude.\r\nYet the state did nothing. The slave possessed no rights, as in the time\r\nwhen he, perhaps, required none. In the case of domestic slavery, the\r\nmoral influence of an intellectually superior race was often an adequate\r\nsubstitute for the absence of rights, and a further _solatium_ was found\r\nin the door of emancipation which was ever open to the favourite. The\r\nRoman was not ungrateful, and he recognised that it was the slave who\r\nmade him an individual power in the world. The unequalled administrative\r\ncapacity of men like C. Gracchus, Crassus, Caesar, and Pompeius, which\r\nhas found no parallel in the modern world, was largely due to their\r\nabsolute command of men of perhaps less originative power, but often of\r\ngreater capacity for combination and detail than they.\r\n\r\nUsefulness to the master was in fact the end to which the changes in the\r\nlaw relating to servitude were directed. The slave might benefit his lord\r\nby a contract entered into with a third party, but could not make his\r\ncondition worse.[569] The _dominus_ could sue on the contract, although\r\nthe slave having no legal personality could conclude only a natural\r\nobligation (_naturalis obligatio_), but he was not liable for the losses.\r\nTo protect third parties, however, and to give the necessary legal credit\r\nto this useful agency, the praetor gradually established a series of\r\nquasi-liabilities for the master, which were really in his interest;\r\nfor without them slave-agency would have become impossible. Thus, if\r\nthe master had countenanced the slave’s contract, he was liable (_actio\r\nquod jussu_); if the slave had embarked his _peculium_ in trade with the\r\nmaster’s knowledge, this property, though in strict law not his own,\r\ncould be claimed by the creditors, after the slave’s debts to the master\r\nhad been deducted (_actio tributoria_). Finally, any liability incurred\r\nby the _peculium_ could be recovered by creditors, the master’s right of\r\ndeducting his own claims against it being preserved (_actio de peculio_),\r\nand any material advantage derived by the master from the contract of\r\na slave was taken into consideration and the property of the _dominus_\r\nmade liable to that extent (_actio de in rem verso_).[570] The slave, in\r\nfact, as having no personality of his own, is the best of agents, and the\r\ntheory of agency, which the law of Rome has bequeathed to us, is one of\r\nthe most perfect and permanent results of her system of slavery.\r\n\r\nApart from these relations to his master the slave was still ignored by\r\nlaw. He could not give evidence in court except under torture.[571] In\r\ncase wrongs were done him, it was not he but his master that demanded\r\nreparation;[572] while his lord himself was the judge of the delicts\r\nwhich he had committed against himself or the household.[573] That for\r\ncrimes against others the slave was tried by the ordinary process of\r\ncriminal law was a concession to society rather than to the wrongdoer,\r\nand the sense of insecurity of the free population amidst their far more\r\nnumerous dependants was expressed in the atrocious law that the murder\r\nof a Roman in his own house should be avenged by the death of the whole\r\n_familia_ that were sleeping beneath the roof at the moment of the\r\ncommission of the crime.[574]\r\n\r\nThe state itself owned slaves who were known as _servi publici_. Some\r\nwere in the service of temples or of colleges of priests. Others were at\r\nthe disposal of magistrates, such as the censors or aediles,[575] for\r\nthe minor duties of attendance and police. Their agency in contracts\r\nwas doubtless as useful to the state as that of private slaves was to\r\nindividuals. Such an agent (_actor publicus_) was kept by the treasury\r\nfor the acquisition of property,[576] which, as his _peculium_, fell\r\nunder the _dominium_ of the state.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that manumission in due form made a citizen of a slave. The\r\n_libertini_, therefore, are not a third class in the state, and only\r\ndemand a separate treatment in so far as their grant of freedom was\r\nconditioned by the performance of certain duties to their former masters,\r\nand in so far as the lack of free birth (_ingenuitas_) entailed certain\r\npolitical disabilities.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the _libertus_[577] to his former master, who now became\r\nhis _patronus_, was to some extent modelled on that of the ancient client\r\nto his lord. The freedman owed his manumitter reverence and obedience\r\n(_obsequium_);[578] he could not prosecute, or appear as a witness\r\nagainst him, in the criminal courts,[579] and he required the permission\r\nof the praetor to bring even a civil action against his former master or\r\nthat master’s near relatives.[580] The patron’s right of succession to\r\nthe freedman’s estate if he died intestate and without heirs,[581] if\r\nit was not a family right, was justified by the fact that the capital\r\nwith which the freedman started life must have been generally the gift\r\nof the master, whether it took the form of a _peculium_ or not. This\r\ncircumstance must have been also felt to justify manumission on the\r\ncondition of continuing to perform certain services to the _dominus_.\r\nBut the privilege of imposing such conditions was abused, and had to\r\nbe limited by the edict of a praetor Rutilius,[582] which practically\r\nconfined them to the performance of certain personal services\r\n(_operae_). The fact that the freedman was still regarded as an appendage\r\nof the _familia_ was most clearly shown by the criminal jurisdiction—even\r\nextending to capital punishment—exercised over him by the head of the\r\nfamily even at the close of the Republic.[583]\r\n\r\nThe political position of the _libertini_ was probably better at the\r\nbeginning than at the end of the Republic. Under the Servian _régime_\r\nthey were, with all other citizens, members of the tribes; whether they\r\nwere at first members of the centuries depends on the question whether\r\nfree birth was always a requisite for military service, and this is a\r\npoint on which evidence entirely fails us;[584] but when the _comitia\r\ncenturiata_ had ceased to be a military and become a purely political\r\ninstitution, there is no reason to assume their exclusion. They would\r\nhave been members of the _comitia tributa_ and _concilium plebis_ from\r\nthe earliest institution of these two bodies. The freedmen (rarely\r\nlandowners and usually mechanics) belonged in the main to the four old\r\ncity tribes. This accident had become a legal prescription by the year\r\n312 B.C. In that year the revolutionary census of App. Claudius, which\r\nwe shall describe elsewhere,[585] spread them over all the tribes,[586]\r\nand probably, according to their census, over all the centuries. In 304\r\nB.C. the old arrangement, which limited the freedman’s vote, was reverted\r\nto.[587] The censors of 169 went further and restricted them all to a\r\nsingle tribe.[588] The conflict required the intervention of law, and it\r\nwas probably the _lex Aemilia_ (of M. Aemilius Scaurus, consul in 115\r\nB.C.) which re-established the old principle of restriction to the urban\r\ntribes.[589] But the question of the freedman’s vote became a battle-cry\r\nin the last century of the Republic. In 88 B.C. the democratic tribune\r\nSulpicius passed a law which gave the _libertinus_ the tribe of his\r\npatron.[590] It was repealed by the optimates; but the second triumph\r\nof the democrats in 84 B.C. again restored the law,[591] until Sulla’s\r\nascendency finally established the limitation to the four city tribes.\r\n\r\nThe freedmen were excused the burden, because not thought worthy of\r\nthe honour, of regular military service in the legions.[592] The same\r\nprejudice did not apply to the fleet, and for this service _libertini_\r\nwere freely employed.[593] The lack of free birth was also a ground of\r\nexclusion from the magistracy, and therefore from the Senate, to which\r\nthis was the stepping-stone.[594]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. _The Theory of the Constitution_\r\n\r\nThe Roman constitution had lost none of its complexity by growth. The\r\naccretions of ages had changed a curious but comparatively simple type\r\nof polity into a jumble of constitutional law and custom, through which\r\neven the keen eye of the Roman jurist could not pierce, and which\r\neven his capacity for fictitious interpretation and the invention of\r\ncompromises could not reduce to a system. The lack of logic, which is the\r\nusual accompaniment of a conservatism not thorough-going enough to be\r\nconsistent, produced a machine the results of which appeared for a time\r\nto be eminently satisfactory. It conquered the world, and succeeded for\r\na time in governing it with some show of decency and a fair measure of\r\nsuccess. Had the equilibrium been maintained in practice as in theory,\r\nmixed constitutions would have had the most assured claim to the respect\r\nand acceptance of the world. But as the knots which the jurist could not\r\nuntie were cut by the sword, and the constitution reverted to a type\r\nfar simpler even than that of its origin, we must assume a weakness in\r\nthe mixed system, which might not have rendered it inadequate as the\r\ngovernment of a city state or even of Italy, but certainly rendered\r\nit incapable of imperial rule. The test was a severe one, and the\r\nconstitution which could not answer the strain need not be wholly\r\ncondemned. For empire is a mere excrescence on the life of a state, a\r\ntest neither of its goodness nor of its vitality. A pure treatment of\r\nthe Roman constitution will neglect, as far as possible, this abnormal\r\ngrowth, and, although much of its structure was the result of war,[595]\r\nwill be able to show that its essential peculiarities were not the effect\r\nof conquest.\r\n\r\nThe Roman state was still a limited sovereignty of the people; so\r\nlimited, indeed, that the people, i.e. the patricio-plebeian _populus\r\nRomanus_, was dependent, not merely for the expression of its will, but\r\neven for its _existence_, on the life of its supreme magistrates. In\r\nthe practice of the Republic down to its closing days, the cessation\r\nof the consulate, by the non-election or the death of its occupants,\r\ncaused the suspension of the life of the state. The people could not meet\r\nexcept under the shadow of the higher _imperium_ or _auspicia_—those of\r\nlesser patrician magistrates were of no avail; for the praetor, though\r\ntechnically a colleague of the consuls,[596] could not hold the consular\r\nelections[597]—and the city was in a state of suspended animation until\r\nthe _auspicia_ in all their purity should be restored, were it but to a\r\nsingle man. The auspices, meanwhile, have returned to the “fathers,”[598]\r\nand it is they only who can restore them. The first fundamental element,\r\ntherefore, in the theory of the Roman constitution, however absurd it\r\nmay seem, is that ultimate sovereignty rests with the patrician members\r\nof the Senate.[599] How this theory was put into practice, and what\r\nmodifications the practice had undergone since the time of the monarchy,\r\nmay be seen by examining the procedure consequent on a Republican\r\n_interregnum_.\r\n\r\nThe conditions requisite for an _interregnum_ were the non-existence\r\nof consuls, or magistrates with consular power, or a dictator. The\r\nretirement of all the other so-called patrician magistrates, i.e.\r\n_magistratus populi_, was another necessary preliminary, for the auspices\r\ncould not return to the _patres_ so long as they were held, whether as\r\n_majora_ or _minora auspicia_,[600] by a patrician magistrate.[601]\r\nHence, when a sudden occasion arose for the appointment of an interrex,\r\nit was the duty of the Senate to give notice to the patrician magistrates\r\nand to request them to retire from office.[602] The plebeian magistrates\r\nstill remained in the exercise of their functions.\r\n\r\nIt was, in the later Republic, the Senate which took all further\r\nnecessary action. In the early Republic there was no possibility of its\r\nbeing summoned, and the patrician senators met at their own discretion\r\nto appoint the interrex. But after the tribune, who was still in office,\r\nhad gained the right of transacting business with the Senate, it was he\r\nwho put the question, and the Senate who suggested that the _patricii_\r\nshould meet for the purpose. From this time onwards the electors felt no\r\nobligation to meet except on the suggestion of the Senate.[603]\r\n\r\nThe collegiate principle of the regal _interregnum_ and the use of the\r\nlot[604] had both disappeared; the agreement of the patrician senators\r\ntook the form of the election (_creatio_)[605] of a single interrex\r\n(_prodere interregem_). This magistrate nominated his successor, as the\r\nconsul nominated the dictator,[606] each succeeding interrex holding\r\noffice for five days. There was no limit to the number that might be\r\ncreated, the interreges varying from the minimum of two to the known\r\nmaximum of fourteen;[607] but there must be at least two, the first\r\nbeing incapable of holding the consular election, probably because\r\nhe was regarded as having received the _auspicia_ irregularly. The\r\nqualifications for the interrex were, that he should be a Patrician[608]\r\nand a senator, and the instances seem to show that he was invariably\r\nchosen from the past holders of curule office.[609] The first interrex\r\nwas no doubt guided by the wishes of the Senate, or of the _patres_, in\r\nthe choice of his nominee, and the whole list may have been prepared\r\nbefore his appointment. With the creation of the highest regular\r\npatrician office, i.e. with the election of a single consul, the\r\n_interregnum_ necessarily came to an end and the interrex retired.\r\n\r\nThe reappointment of a chief magistrate called the people into life\r\nagain; and, as a rule, it perpetuated itself by perpetuating the\r\nmagistracy. There was, indeed, one large section of the people which\r\nhad a continuity of existence as a corporation—this was the _concilium_\r\nof the Plebs with its presidents, the tribunes. From the year 287 this\r\n_concilium_ was an independent legislative sovereign, and nothing more\r\nclearly marks the theoretical dualism of popular sovereignty at Rome than\r\nthe fact that one parliament could continue to exist while the other, the\r\n_comitia_ in its various shapes, was dormant. The division of executive,\r\njudicial, even of deliberative power, is not uncommon in governments\r\nof the mixed type; the division of unlimited legislative authority is\r\nrarer and nowhere so clearly marked as in Rome; for an act of parliament\r\ndid not require the co-operation of the two assemblies—the separate\r\n_fiat_ of each had the force of law.[610] It is true that in practice\r\nthis fundamental dualism was not acutely felt, for the individual\r\nelements of the Populus and the Plebs were to all intents and purposes\r\nthe same. We may emphasise the practical similarity and the theoretical\r\ndifference best by glancing at the two assemblies of the tribes. Except\r\nin elective matters they differed hardly at all in the sphere of their\r\ncompetence—each was a legislative and judicial assembly. But they were\r\nunder the presidency of magistrates of different kinds, and this caused a\r\nslight difference in their constitution. When the tribunes of the Plebs\r\nsummoned the people by tribes, the members of the few patrician families\r\ndid not attend; when the consul or praetor summoned the people by tribes,\r\nthe Patricians could be present.[611] A fundamental distinction in theory\r\nhere produces little effect in practice.\r\n\r\nWhile this dual sovereignty—harmless except for its incidental effect\r\nof the preservation of the tribunate—was a result of the course taken\r\nby the evolution of plebeian privileges, a far more serious consequence\r\nwas produced by what we noticed as the second leading idea in the Roman\r\nconstitution’s period of growth,[612] the weakening of the magistracy.\r\nThis weakening—partly the result of a struggle for freedom, partly\r\nof accidental circumstances such as the distractions of war—from the\r\nfirst assumed a form which prevented Rome from ever expanding into a\r\ndemocracy. The early Greek states adopted the system of weakening the\r\nsole magistracy, first by dividing its functions amongst several holders,\r\nand then, when this was not sufficient, by deliberately taking powers\r\nfrom them and giving them to carefully organised popular bodies. In Rome\r\nthe principle of division was not wholly unknown; thus the censorship\r\nand praetorship take over some of the functions of the consulate, but\r\nthe principle of wholesale transference was entirely absent; even the\r\nusurpation of capital jurisdiction by the people was modified by the\r\ncondition that they could meet only on the summons of a magistrate. The\r\nprinciple of weakening adopted at Rome was that of the increase of the\r\nnumber of magistrates, without any essential alteration of the character\r\nof the magistracy. The increase was effected partly by a consistent\r\napplication of the principle of colleagueship, partly by the setting up\r\nof new powers in conflict with the old. The result was chaos. In the\r\ndeveloped constitution there were twenty annual magistrates—ten tribunes,\r\ntwo consuls, eight praetors—each armed with the power of passing valid\r\nacts of parliament, and of vetoing the resolutions of his colleagues and\r\ninferiors. It is true that there was a legal subordination amongst them;\r\nthe consul was inferior to the tribune, the praetor to the consul; and\r\nthe rigorous application of law would have reduced the Roman constitution\r\nto an oligarchy of ten. As a matter of fact, the tribunate was too early\r\nenlisted on the side of the nobility to think of pressing its powers;\r\ndissension reigned within the college, and the history of the collective\r\nmagistracy was one of perpetual conflict and therefore of weakness.\r\nIn this weakness the people shared, for they were wholly dependent\r\non the magistracy. In shaking the authority of their representatives\r\nthey had shaken their own; and certain radical defects in the popular\r\norganisation, which we shall discuss when we consider the assemblies\r\nmore in detail, added to their incapacity to rule. Since the guidance of\r\nmagistrates and of people was equally impossible, and central government\r\nmust reside somewhere, its fitting place was not unnaturally sought in\r\nthe single experienced, permanent, and deliberative body in the state,\r\nthe Senate.[613] The assumption of the reins of government by a power,\r\nwhich as an independent authority was not contemplated in the original\r\nconstitution, necessarily gave rise to a body of constitutional custom\r\nby the side of the older constitutional law. The applications of this\r\nnew code can only be estimated by a more detailed treatment of the three\r\nfactors of government—the magistracy, the people, and the Senate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE MAGISTRACY\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. _General Characteristics of the Magistracy_\r\n\r\nThe collective powers of the magistrate had, as we saw, been summed up in\r\nthe word _imperium_; they had, perhaps, also been expressed by the vaguer\r\nterm _potestas_. When, in course of time, magistracies were created which\r\ndid not possess the _imperium_, _potestas_ was necessarily the only word\r\nwhich expressed the _generic_ power of the magistracy; _imperium_ became\r\na special _species_ of this power. Thus one could speak of the _consulare\r\nimperium_ or of the _consularis potestas_, but only of the _tribunicia\r\npotestas_.[614]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to treat collectively of the special manifestations\r\nof this authority; for the magistracies were graduated by differences\r\nof power. To avoid confusion and repetition it will be best, in this\r\ngeneral sketch, to give a complete list of magisterial powers, and to\r\npoint out in each case where they are accorded to, or withheld from, the\r\nparticular occupants of office. Magisterial powers may be divided into\r\n(i.) administrative, (ii.) those exercised in connexion with the people,\r\n(iii.) those exercised in connexion with the Senate; and (iv.) certain\r\ngeneral powers which underlie all these spheres of activity—the right\r\nof interpreting the will of the gods through auspices, and the right of\r\nenforcing decrees.\r\n\r\n(i.) _Administrative powers._—The sphere of administrative activity had\r\nfrom the first days of the Republic been divided into the two departments\r\nof command at home (_domi_) and abroad (_militiae_), the dividing line\r\nbetween the two being sometimes the _pomerium_, sometimes the limit\r\nmarked by the first milestone outside the city.[615]\r\n\r\nThe home administration can be adequately considered only when we deal\r\nwith the separate magistracies. But the common form in which it asserted\r\nitself may be considered here. This was the right of issuing commands in\r\nthe form of edicts (_jus edicendi_), applicable to the special branches\r\nof administration under the control of the magistrates, from the quaestor\r\nto the consul.[616] The edicts of all the magistrates corresponded to one\r\nanother in their general form; they contained commands, prohibitions,\r\nand advice. They were all at an early period issued in writing, and the\r\ndifference between them was simply that while some, such as those of the\r\nconsuls and quaestors, were occasional and, when the necessity for them\r\nhad passed, withdrawn, others, such as those of the censors, praetors,\r\ncurule aediles and provincial governors, were continuous (_perpetua_),\r\nas being called forth by ever-present necessities, and were therefore\r\ntransmitted by magistrates to their successors (_tralaticia_). Prominent\r\nin their continuity were those of the censors and praetors; while the one\r\ncreated a code of Roman morality, the other developed a system of legal\r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\nThe administrative duties abroad belonged exclusively to the magistrates\r\nwith _imperium_, i.e. in the ordinary course of things to the consuls\r\nand praetors, in exceptional circumstances to the dictator.[617] The\r\ntreatment of provincial administration may be deferred until we deal with\r\nthe provinces and the pro-magistracy which imperial government created.\r\nHere we may appropriately notice the exceptional powers which military\r\ncommand gave to the magistrate over the persons and services of the\r\nburgesses, and the honours which it conferred on its possessor.\r\n\r\nThe first right conferred by military command (_imperium_ in the\r\nnarrower sense[618]) was that of the formation of an army by enforced\r\nconscription (_dilectus_). It was exercised, however, only by the\r\nmagistrate in supreme command, that is, by the consuls or the dictator,\r\nnot by the praetor. It was a purely magisterial right, and in the levy\r\nof the regular consular army of four legions the consuls were probably\r\nindependent of any guidance. Custom eventually dictated that, when\r\nexceptional forces were needed, the permission for the raising of these\r\nshould come from the Senate.[619] Within this permission the consuls\r\nacted at their own discretion. They summoned all the _juniores_ to meet\r\nthem, formerly on the Capitol, later in the Campus Martius; and under\r\ntheir inspection the military tribunes selected whom they would and bound\r\nthe conscripts to obedience by a military oath (_sacramentum_).[620]\r\nAlthough this oath was in form one of personal allegiance to special\r\ncommanders, was tendered to both colleagues[621] and had to be renewed\r\nwith every change of command,[622] its primary import was to give the\r\nsoldier the right of using weapons against enemies, and to change what\r\nwould have been acts of mere brigandage (_latrocinium_) into those of\r\nlegitimate service (_legitima militia_).[623] A secondary association\r\nwith the oath may in early times have been that he who broke it was\r\n_sacer_, and that the vengeance of the gods could be satisfied by summary\r\nexecution inflicted by the general on the offender.[624] The power of\r\ninflicting capital punishment for military offences did not, however,\r\nneed this religious sanction; it was a consequence of the _coercitio_ of\r\nthe _imperator_, when outside the sphere of the _provocatio_[625] and\r\nunchecked by the veto of a colleague.[626] A further right preliminary\r\nto the conduct of war was the nomination of the officers of the\r\narmy—the military tribunes, centurions, decurions, and commanders of\r\nevery branch. Appointment to all these posts, from the highest to the\r\nlowest, was originally in the hands of the consuls; but the tendency of\r\nthe Republic was to remove selection to the higher military commands\r\nfrom the discretion of the magistrate. In 362 B.C. the creation of\r\nsix of the military tribunes of the standing army of four legions was\r\ntransferred to the people in the _comitia tributa_;[627] by the year\r\n207 all of the twenty-four had been thus elected,[628] and the standing\r\nmilitary tribunate had become one of the regular minor magistracies of\r\nthe state.[629] The tribunes for other legions that might be raised were\r\nstill nominated by the consuls,[630] and sometimes the people gave up\r\nits right of election in their favour.[631] In raising supplies most\r\nmagistrates were dependent on the Senate; but the consul’s original\r\ncontrol of the _aerarium_ survived in the right he possessed of ordering\r\nthe quaestor to pay him any money he required for military expenses.[632]\r\n\r\nWhen the preparations for war were completed and the consuls took the\r\nfield, their discretionary authority in the conduct of the campaign,\r\nin finance and in jurisdiction, was almost absolute. The first power\r\nwas hampered only by the condition that they could not wage war against\r\na state which stood in any degree of alliance with Rome without the\r\nconsent of the people; the second received some slight limitation\r\nfrom the appointment of military quaestors in 421;[633] the third was\r\ntheoretically unlimited throughout the whole history of the Republic, but\r\nreceived some slight modification from the growing sense of the sanctity\r\nof the life of a Roman citizen, which made the generals during the last\r\ncentury of the Republic more chary of pronouncing capital sentences\r\nupon their officers and soldiers.[634] It is important to remember that\r\nthis absolute jurisdiction _militiae_ was not in the least confined\r\nto the army; every Roman citizen within the sphere of the general’s\r\nadministration, and every provincial, when these spheres had developed\r\ninto standing provinces, were equally subjected to martial law.[635] The\r\nprovincial in fact was often in better case than the Roman sojourning in\r\nthe provinces. He could sometimes appeal to the liberties granted to his\r\ntown by charter; but the Roman found that his palladia—the _provocatio_\r\nand the _intercessio_—had vanished in this sphere.[636]\r\n\r\nA victory over the foe gave the general the right to claim two\r\nfurther privileges—the one a titular designation, the other a popular\r\nmanifestation of success—which were strictly regulated by constitutional\r\nlaw. Every holder of the _imperium_ was necessarily an _imperator_; but\r\nfrom a very early period of the Republic it was considered improper for\r\nthe possessor of the very limited _imperium_ within the walls to use this\r\ntitle. It was reserved for the general in command of an army; _imperator_\r\nis both the official and the familiar title by which he was addressed by\r\nhis soldiers. But, even under these circumstances, it was not employed\r\nby the general himself as a part of his official designation. For this\r\na victory was requisite; the soldiers after the battle proclaimed him\r\nconqueror by shouting the familiar name; from this time he was supposed\r\nto have it impressed on him in a peculiar manner and could bear it\r\nin his list of titles.[637] Custom decreed that the honour should be\r\nassumed only in consequence of a great and decisive victory;[638] but\r\nthe ambition and rivalry of provincial governors finally caused the most\r\ntrifling successes to be commemorated in this way.\r\n\r\nThe salutation was the usual preliminary to a triumph—the solemn\r\nprocession of the general through the city to the Capitol at the head of\r\nhis victorious army. As the title _imperator_ could be conferred only on\r\na commander-in-chief, and was inconsistent with delegated authority, the\r\ntriumph was necessarily confined to the magistrates with the capacity for\r\nsupreme command—the dictator, consul and praetor,[639] and to the one\r\nof these who at the moment of victory was in highest authority. Thus the\r\ndictator usually excluded the consul,[640] the consul the praetor; and\r\nwhen two consuls were in command, the right resided with the one who had\r\nthe _imperium_ and the _auspicia_ on the day of the victory.[641] The\r\nsame rule held when the honour was granted to pro-magistrates; here too\r\nindependent command was the necessary condition of a triumph.\r\n\r\nOther qualifications were fixed by custom. The return of the victorious\r\narmy was originally necessary—a rule which rendered the most deserving\r\ngeneral, who had handed over his forces to a successor, incapable of\r\ntriumphing,[642] and which, with the growth of standing armies, had to\r\nbe abandoned for the rule that the province must be reduced to a state\r\nof peace (_provincia pacata_).[643] The war must be a _justum bellum_,\r\nnot the mere crushing a revolt of citizens or slaves;[644] and finally,\r\nthe custom was fixed that it must be a war, the magnitude of which was\r\nattested by the fall of 5000 foes.[645]\r\n\r\nThe right to triumph was one entirely at the discretion of the general;\r\nand as long as he chose the Alban Mount as the scene of his military\r\npageant, no power could hinder him.[646] It was only when he wished to\r\nenter the city of Rome for the more imposing procession to the Capitol\r\nthat he found difficulties in his way. The triumph implied the display\r\nof the full military _imperium_ within the city;[647] and, though\r\ninstances are not lacking of magistrates who on their own responsibility\r\nsuccessfully asserted this right,[648] the custom became fixed that\r\npermission for this display should be accorded by the state. Originally\r\nit may have been granted by the people,[649] but the permission for\r\nthe exercise of the full _imperium_ for the single day soon required\r\nthe consent of the Senate, all the more necessary as its control of\r\nfinance enabled it to grant or refuse the money which paid the expenses\r\nof the triumph.[650] The case was otherwise with the pro-magistrate.\r\nThe proconsul had only the _imperium militiae_, and none within the\r\nwalls, and it was impossible, therefore, for the Senate to recognise\r\nthe display of a power which did not exist. In this case a special\r\ndispensation from the laws was necessary, which could originally be\r\ngranted only by the people. The Senate took the initiative by asking the\r\ntribunes to introduce a _plebiscitum_ sanctioning the arrangement.[651]\r\nThe continuity of the _imperium_ from magistracy to pro-magistracy was\r\noriginally a condition of the triumph. Thus it was refused to the elder\r\nScipio Africanus who had been elected proconsul without having exercised\r\nany previous _imperium_.[652] By the close of the Republic both these\r\nscruples had been set aside. The triumph was decreed to proconsuls\r\nby the Senate, and without regard to their having held any previous\r\n_imperium_.[653]\r\n\r\n(ii.) _Powers exercised in connexion with the people._—The dealings\r\nwhich the magistrate had with the assembled people were of two kinds;\r\nhe might summon them for the purpose of imparting information: in this\r\ncase the meeting was called a _contio_;[654] or he might convene them\r\nfor the purpose of passing decrees binding on the community: such an\r\nassembly assumed one of the various forms of the _comitia_. The first\r\npower (_contionem habere_) was often preliminary to the exercise of the\r\nsecond (_cum populo agere_); for a _contio_ or a series of _contiones_\r\ngenerally preceded the formal meetings of the assemblies at which laws\r\nor _plebiscita_ were passed,[655] and was in fact an indispensable\r\npreliminary, since, in the case of legislation, it was the chief\r\nopportunity for recommendations or criticisms of a bill, and, in the case\r\nof popular jurisdiction, was the only means by which the people could\r\nform an estimate of the evidence. The magisterial _contio_ was, in fact,\r\nthe great vehicle for constitutional agitation and, as such, the most\r\ndemocratic institution in Rome.\r\n\r\nBut the use of the _contio_ was not confined to the preliminaries of\r\nlegislation. It was the form in which the people were summoned to witness\r\nany public act,[656] and to listen to the magistrate’s commands when\r\nthese were expressed in the form of verbal edicts.[657] The essential\r\nfeature of such an assembly was that the people were invited to meet a\r\nmagistrate and to listen to his views; the masses were mere auditors; and\r\nthe fact that this was no chance gathering was further emphasised by the\r\nsolemnity of the proceedings—the formal summons, the opening prayer,[658]\r\nand the elevation of the magistrate on the tribunal. We cannot say with\r\ncertainty how far this right of holding a _contio_ extended. It was\r\ncertainly possessed by the consuls, praetors, censors, and tribunes, and\r\nprobably by all the magistrates down to the quaestor.[659] The conflict\r\nof magisterial authority was felt here as in other departments, and the\r\nhigher magistrate could summon to himself the _contio_ convoked by an\r\ninferior.[660]\r\n\r\nThe Roman constitution recognised no right of public meeting; a gathering\r\nof the citizens by a citizen might be treated as a breach of the peace,\r\nor might be summarily visited by the _coercitio_ of a magistrate. But the\r\nincrease of the magistrates, and the corresponding divergence of their\r\nviews, supplied a partial substitute for this popular self-repression.\r\nIt was open to any magistrate to introduce a citizen to the _contio_,\r\nand give him a right to speak (_producere in contionem_, _dare\r\ncontionem_);[661] it was equally open to a colleague or superior to\r\nveto this permission;[662] but custom must have made such a use of the\r\n_intercessio_ very infrequent. The right of granting a _contio_ gave a\r\nlimited power of debate on legislative matters to distinguished private\r\nindividuals; but this was not its only use. It was the sole means by\r\nwhich political leaders, who might happen to be in a private station—as\r\nPompeius after his return from the East, or Cicero after his recall from\r\nexile—could express their views;[663] it was also a convenient mode in\r\nwhich a magistrate might justify a line of conduct. We find a foreign\r\nking and a public informer thus produced to influence the popular mind.\r\nThe _jus contionis dandae_ meant an increase in magisterial power, and\r\nwas no true concession to democracy; the demagogue in opposition, who was\r\nnot a magistrate or useful to a magistrate, had no opportunity of making\r\nhis voice heard in Rome.\r\n\r\nThe right of eliciting binding resolutions from the people when assembled\r\nin their _comitia_ (_jus cum populo agendi_) always remained an inherent\r\nattribute of the _imperium_; as such it belonged, under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, to the consul and praetor; under exceptional conditions,\r\nto the dictator, interrex, and consular tribunes. It was also possessed\r\nby one at least of the occasional delegates of the highest magistrates,\r\nthe master of the horse.[664] By these magistrates the _comitia_ might\r\nbe assembled in any form—by curies, by centuries, or by tribes. None of\r\nthe lower magistrates possessed in their own right the power to summon\r\nand preside over the assembly; but the extension of the _provocatio_\r\nand the consequent growth of popular jurisdiction rendered it necessary\r\nthat the lower magistrates with judicial powers should meet the people.\r\nThus the curule aediles defended their sentences before the _comitia\r\ntributa_;[665] the delegates of the consular criminal jurisdiction, the\r\n_quaestores parricidii_, and _duumviri perduellionis_ brought their\r\njudgments before the _comitia_ of the centuries.[666] No plebeian\r\nmagistrate had the _jus agendi cum populo_; hence when the tribune,\r\nin the exercise of his jurisdiction, wished to obey the command of\r\nthe Twelve Tables, which confined the hearing of capital cases to the\r\n_comitia_ of the centuries, he had to ask a patrician magistrate—in\r\nthis case the praetor—to call a meeting for him by a given day (_diem a\r\npraetore petere_).[667] When the praetor had named a day (_diem dixit_)\r\nthe tribune then appeared in the assembly as the accuser.[668]\r\n\r\nThe right of eliciting formal resolutions from the Plebs (_jus cum plebe\r\nagendi_) belonged exclusively to the plebeian magistrates. The tribunes\r\nalone had the presidency of the _concilium_, but here again the growth\r\nof popular jurisdiction rendered it necessary that the plebeian aediles\r\nshould defend their sentences before the Plebs.[669]\r\n\r\n(iii.) _Powers exercised in connexion with the Senate._—The right of\r\nbringing matters before the Senate (_jus cum patribus agendi, consulendi\r\nsenatus, referendi ad senatum_) is one that runs parallel to the right\r\nof transacting business with the Populus, and, as such, it is attributed\r\nby Cicero[670] to the same magistrates—to the consuls and praetors, the\r\ndictator, magister equitum, and interrex. It of necessity attached to the\r\nconsular tribunes of early times, and was one of the attributes of the\r\n_praefectus urbi_.[671]\r\n\r\nThis right necessarily did not attach originally to the tribunes of the\r\nPlebs, for they were first the outcome of a revolution, and then for\r\ncenturies the presidents of a corporation independent of the people.\r\nBut, after the _lex Hortensia_ had made the _concilium plebis_ one of\r\nthe legislative organs of the community, it would have been dangerous to\r\nsenatorial government to deny the president of this assembly the right of\r\nconsulting the Senate.[672] The admission of the tribunes into the circle\r\nof the magistrates with the _jus consulendi_ was one of the conditions of\r\nthe Senate’s permanent control over initiative in legislation.\r\n\r\n(iv.) _General powers: the auspicia and the coercitio._—We have now to\r\nconsider certain magisterial powers which cannot be regarded as forming\r\na separate department, since they are coextensive with the whole sphere\r\nof official authority. The first that we shall treat, the taking of the\r\nauspices, was as much a duty as a right. The observance of the _auspicia\r\npublica_ is not merely an act that the magistrate may perform, but\r\none that he must perform if his powers are to be duly exercised. The\r\n_imperium_ and the _auspicia_ are indissolubly connected;[673] they are\r\nthe divine and human side of the same power, and every important act of\r\nhuman activity should be prefaced by an appeal for divine assistance.\r\nWe have already explained that the only auspices which are properly\r\nconnected with the magistracy were those known as _impetrativa_, and\r\nthat the looking for these—the gift of _spectio_—was always a peculiar\r\nattribute of the patrician magistracy,[674] and was, therefore, not\r\npossessed by the tribunes and aediles of the Plebs. With respect to the\r\nother category of auspices—the _oblativa_—not only are all magistrates on\r\na level with one another, but they are all below the level of the meanest\r\ncitizen. The citizen, if he is a devout man, may suspend the business\r\nhe has in hand, if an evil sign appears. The magistrate is bound to do\r\nso, if the sign is by common consent evil, or has been pronounced such\r\nby the college of pontiffs or by the Sibylline books. Roman theology\r\nrecognised five categories of auspices; four of these belong to the class\r\n_impetrativa_, one to the class _oblativa_.[675] The latter, as being\r\nthe simpler and the one common to all the magistrates, may be considered\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n(1) _Dirae._—These were a heterogeneous collection of signs of ill omen.\r\nAnything that broke the silence (_silentium_)[676] when the auspices\r\nwere being taken was of this character, such as the fall of anything\r\nin a temple (_caducum auspicium_),[677] or a sudden noise, such as the\r\nsqueak of a mouse.[678] Such too was any sudden event that seemed to warn\r\nback from a course once taken—the flight of ravens towards the walker\r\nor round his head, and the stumbling of his foot on the threshold;[679]\r\nthe struggle of birds in the air ending in the defeat of those that had\r\nflown from the direction of the general’s camp;[680] the seizing of the\r\nboundary stones of a newly laid-out city by wolves,[681] and countless\r\nothers. A peculiarly dreadful omen was a fit of epilepsy, called, from\r\nits power of suspending the assemblies, _morbus comitialis_. Such signs,\r\nto be effective hindrances, must have an obvious connexion in time and\r\nplace with the act they impede, and must, besides, be noticed by the\r\nagent. Hence a flash of lightning was the most effective of _auspicia\r\noblativa_. Less potent signs could be ignored by veiling the senses. The\r\naugur, who is asked by the officiating magistrate if there is silence,\r\ndoes not look round him, but straightway answers “yes”;[682] in sacrifice\r\nflutes are blown to drown all other sounds,[683] and the general bent\r\non fighting takes the precaution of travelling in a closed litter.[684]\r\nIf another person forced the omen on the magistrate’s notice, he was\r\nbound to attend to it. This announcement (_nuntiatio_ or _obnuntiatio_)\r\nwe shall speak of elsewhere; it belongs to the history of the conflict\r\nbetween the authorities of the different magistrates.\r\n\r\nThe four other classes of omens belong to the category of _auspicia\r\nimpetrativa_. These were—\r\n\r\n(2) Signs from the flight of birds (_signa ex avibus_), the oldest form\r\nof augural discipline, as the very words _augures_ and _auspicium_\r\nprove, and one that in the early Republic was used in all solemn acts\r\nof state, such as the summons of the _comitia_ or the appointment of a\r\ndictator.[685]\r\n\r\n(3) Closely akin to this was the augury from the motions and sounds of\r\nfour-footed beasts (_signa ex quadrupedibus_); but by the close of the\r\nRepublic these forms of divination, which required study and research,\r\nhad given place to the two remaining classes, which were more easily\r\ninterpreted, or more readily manipulated for political purposes. These\r\nwere the _coelestia auspicia_ and the _auspicia ex tripudiis_.[686]\r\n\r\n(4) Chief of the heavenly signs (_celestia auspicia_), and the surest\r\nexpression of Jupiter’s will, were thunder and lightning. Thunder seems\r\nsometimes to have been regarded as a wholly evil omen;[687] but the\r\ncourse taken by the lightning determined its significance—if on the\r\nwatcher’s left, it was lucky; if on the right, unlucky.[688]\r\n\r\n(5) The _auspicia ex tripudiis_ were signs given by the feeding of tame\r\nbirds (_aves internuntii Jovis_)—generally domestic fowls. If, while they\r\nate, something fell from their mouths (_tripudium solistimum_), still\r\nmore if the falling object made a ringing noise (_sonivium_), the sign\r\nwas taken as an assent of the gods to the business in hand. This mode\r\nof augury was convenient for two reasons. It was always available; the\r\nbirds could be taken about in cages under the custody of their keepers\r\nand interpreters of their acts, the _pullarii_. Hence it was the mode of\r\naugury specially favoured in the camp, and the sacred chickens were the\r\ninvariable attendants of a Roman army. Again, the favourable sign might\r\nbe so easily gained. The irate Roman admiral, who threw his chickens that\r\nwould not eat into the sea, lacked the patience to wring the wished-for\r\nomen from them by protracted hunger, or by feeding them with porridge\r\nwhich they could not swallow with sufficient rapidity.[689]\r\n\r\nThe auspices were at first an accompaniment of the _imperium_; later,\r\nwhen they became an attribute of the whole patrician magistracy, their\r\nimportance varied with the _potestas_ of the magistrate. Officials\r\nwith _imperium_ were said to possess _maxima auspicia_, and the\r\npro-magistrates were naturally included in this list, for the auspices\r\nwere as necessary in war as in peace; those of the censors, on account\r\nof the importance of this office, were reckoned _maxima_, although\r\nthe occasions on which they were taken were so unique that they\r\nwere not brought into the same category as those of the consuls and\r\npraetors; those of the lower magistrates, aediles and quaestors, were\r\ncalled _minora_.[690] This was little more than a formal difference,\r\nhad reference merely to the importance of the respective spheres of\r\noperation, for which observations were made, and did not determine the\r\nkinds of auspices that might be taken by each magistrate.\r\n\r\nThe occasions of the magistrate’s auspication embraced every public act\r\nof any importance. In three cases above all was it regarded as essential;\r\nthese were the nomination of a magistrate, the holding of the _comitia_,\r\nand the departure of a general for war. The chief rule of observance was\r\nthat the auspices must be taken on the same day and in the same place\r\nin which the act was to be performed. The fact that the Roman civil day\r\n(_dies civilis_) began at midnight[691] was convenient for procuring the\r\nrequisite _silentium_; and sometimes, to prevent any flaw (_vitium_),\r\nthe act itself was performed before daybreak. Thus the consul, when he\r\nnominates a dictator, “rises in the stillness of the night”[692] to do\r\nso. The ceremonial for all public auspication[693] was as follows. A\r\nsacred enclosure (_templum_) was marked out on the required spot—within\r\nor without the _pomerium_, according to the purpose in view—within\r\nwhich the magistrate pitched his tent (_tabernaculum capere_),[694]\r\nwhich had one side open for observation. After midnight he rose, and,\r\nseated on the floor, performed the rite. Its validity depended on his\r\npersonal observation alone; but he might invite skilled assistants to\r\nhis aid.[695] The consequence of inability to get a favourable omen was\r\nnecessarily the non-performance of the contemplated act; the only course\r\nopen was to wait for another day, and to seek the auspices over again\r\n(_repetere auspicia_).[696] If the act had been performed in spite of ill\r\nomens, or if subsequent reflection showed a flaw in the ceremonial, the\r\nact was said to be subject to a _vitium_ which rendered it invalid; the\r\nlaw passed did not hold good, and the magistrate thus faultily elected\r\n(_vitio creatus_) had to resign his functions.[697] In the case of the\r\nelection of the consuls being thus vitiated the consequences might be\r\nserious; for if the flaw was discovered after their entrance on office,\r\na renewal of the auspices (_renovatio auspiciorum_)[698] could only be\r\neffected through an _interregnum_. It was in this connexion that the\r\npower of the augurs came into play, for they were the interpreters of\r\nthe heaven-sent signs. It was no wonder that membership of the augural\r\ncollege was the highest ambition of the Roman statesman, when its decree\r\ncould upset a law, stave off a capital charge, or force a consul to\r\nabdicate. It is true that the augurs could give their advice only on the\r\nrequest of a magistrate or of the Senate; but, as a measure or election\r\nnot favoured by the government would readily be challenged in this way,\r\nthe decision as to the future of the state often rested wholly with the\r\ncollege of augurs. Their power of interpretation extended to the far more\r\nfrequent _auspicia oblativa_, and in reporting these even the initiative\r\nmight, as we shall see, be taken by an augur.\r\n\r\nSince the _auspicia publica_ were personal signs vouchsafed to\r\nindividuals, a collision between the auspices of colleagues engaged in\r\nthe same business was not impossible. What the result of such a collision\r\nwas in the case of magistrates engaged _domi_ is unknown.[699] In the\r\nfield the effective auspices were in the hands of the consul whose\r\nturn for command had come,[700] or, in case of joint command, in those\r\nof the higher magistrate; thus the auspices of the consul extinguished\r\nthose of the praetor.[701] In the later Republic the difficulty scarcely\r\nexisted, as joint command of two magistrates with _imperium_ became very\r\ninfrequent, and the proconsul or propraetor took the auspices alone.\r\n\r\nThe auspices were the mode in which the god’s will was revealed to the\r\nmagistrate. The other universal power—the _coercitio_—was the mode in\r\nwhich the magistrate’s will was forced on man. It was the method in which\r\nhe compelled obedience to his commands, or secured the performance of\r\nstate obligations which it was his duty to enforce. It was, therefore,\r\nin touch with criminal jurisdiction, but differed from it in two ways.\r\nFirstly, _coercitio_ was not directed to the enforcement of the permanent\r\nobligations of man to his fellow man, which is the object of the criminal\r\nlaw, but rather to the repression of exceptional acts directed against\r\nthe state as a whole; and secondly, the means of _coercitio_ actually\r\navailable could be employed by the magistrate on his own responsibility,\r\nwhile the power of jurisdiction he shared with the people. This second\r\ndifference, however, was unknown to constitutional theory. The magistrate\r\nmight avail himself of any means of coercion against a harmful or\r\ndisobedient citizen—he might employ fines, bonds, and scourging;[702]\r\nbut the fine, beyond a certain limit, and the scourging gave rise to the\r\n_provocatio_; in this case magisterial coercion led on to jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe objects of magisterial _coercitio_ were by no means always private\r\ncitizens. It could be directed against senators and _judices_, and could\r\nbe exercised by any superior over any inferior magistrate, to compel his\r\nrespect or to force him to a performance of his duties.\r\n\r\nThe severest mode of coercion—the infliction of the death penalty—was,\r\nas we saw, originally inherent in the _imperium_, but was rendered\r\nimpossible by two Valerian laws of 509 and 449 B.C.[703] A third _lex\r\nValeria_ of 300 B.C. prohibited the execution or scourging of one who\r\nhad appealed; but the weakness of former enactments was repeated in this\r\nlaw; it declared the magistrate’s contravention of it to be _improbe\r\nfactum_.[704] An effective sanction seems first to have been supplied by\r\none of the three Porcian laws;[705] certainly at the end of the Republic\r\na violation of the _provocatio_ entailed a capital penalty on the\r\nmagistrate.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the capital jurisdiction of the tribunes, we have\r\nseen how their tacit recognition of the appeal gave rise to this\r\njurisdiction.[706] But in theory the coercion of the tribune, when\r\nused in defence of the sanctity of his own person, was not subject to\r\nappeal.[707] Here the old religious penalties remained in force, and a\r\nperiod as late as the year 131 B.C. witnessed the spectacle of a tribune\r\ndragging a censor, who had degraded him, to the Tarpeian rock with intent\r\nto hurl him down—a fate from which he was saved only by the veto of the\r\ntribune’s colleagues.[708]\r\n\r\nScourging, which is found in the early Republic as a punishment employed\r\nin the military levy,[709] was practically abolished as a mode of\r\n_coercitio_ by the third _lex Valeria_ of 300 B.C.[710] and the _leges\r\nPorciae_, which submitted the threat of such punishment to appeal, the\r\nlatter laws imposing a heavy penalty on the magistrate who inflicted it.\r\n\r\nImprisonment (_abductio in carcerem, in vincula_), although not\r\nrecognised as a penalty in Roman law, plays a double part in the\r\n_coercitio_. It was one of the modes by which the magistrates defended\r\ntheir dignity and secured obedience, not merely from private citizens,\r\nbut from lower magistrates and senators; and it was adopted as a\r\nprecautionary measure to secure the appearance on trial of one whom\r\nthey accused. The use of this severe measure against magistrates by\r\nany power but the tribunate is rare;[711] but it plays a great part\r\nin the tribunician annals, and the temporary imprisonment of a consul\r\nbecame a familiar feature of party strife during the closing years of\r\nthe Republic.[712] It was a summary method of silencing the opposition\r\nof a too zealous optimate, and the veto of the tribune’s colleague was\r\nthe only means of releasing the head of the state.[713] Preventive\r\nimprisonment for the purpose of securing the appearance of an accused at\r\ntrial was rare at Rome. The custom of giving sureties or bail (_vades,\r\nvadimonium_) was early recognised;[714] but it rested entirely with the\r\nmagistrate whether he should accept such a security.[715]\r\n\r\nThe imposition of a fine (_multa_) was the most common mode of enforcing\r\nobedience, and was possessed by all the magistrates with the possible\r\nexception of the quaestor.[716] As early as 454 B.C. the power of fining\r\n(_jus multae dictionis_), which had hitherto belonged to the consuls\r\nalone, was conferred “on all magistrates”—including, therefore, the\r\ntribunes and plebeian aediles—by a _lex Aternia Tarpeia_ passed in the\r\nassembly of the centuries.[717] The _lex Menenia Sextia_ (452 B.C.)\r\nfixed the highest fine that could be imposed by a magistrate on his own\r\nauthority (_multa suprema_) at two sheep or thirty oxen[718]—the former\r\nthe limit for the poor man, the latter for the rich. After coined money,\r\nor at least metal by weight, had come into vogue during the decemviral\r\nperiod, a _lex Julia Papiria_ (_de multarum aestimatione_) of 430\r\nB.C. fixed 3000 libral asses as the extreme amount that a magistrate\r\nmight impose.[719] The infliction of a fine larger than this _multa\r\nsuprema_ subjected the official who pronounced it to an appeal to the\r\npeople.[720] The _provocatio_ against _multae_ went before the _comitia_\r\nor the _concilium_ of the tribes according as the fines were imposed\r\nby patrician or plebeian magistrates, and we shall see how this appeal\r\nbrought the aediles into contact with these two assemblies.[721] Certain\r\nlaws continued to fix an absolute limit even to fines submitted to the\r\njudgment of the people. They were generally limited to less than half of\r\nthe property of the accused.[722]\r\n\r\nBut the tribunes’ power of imposing money penalties extended far\r\nbeyond the limits of that of the other magistrates. The power of\r\nconfiscating all the goods of an individual by consecrating them to a god\r\n(_consecratio bonorum_), a relic, like the execution from the Tarpeian\r\nrock, of the old religious jurisdiction and as little subject to the\r\nappeal, had been occasionally put in force by them in extreme cases,[723]\r\nand like other vanished relics of antiquity was revived during the party\r\nstruggles of the close of the Republic.\r\n\r\nAnother mode of coercion, specially used against magistrates and the\r\nofficial class, was the seizing of articles of their property as pledges\r\n(_pignoris capio_).[724] It was possessed by all the magistrates who\r\nhad the _coercitio_, and was employed rather as a punishment than as a\r\nsecurity for good behaviour. Hence the pledges were often destroyed,[725]\r\nand we find a consul seeking satisfaction for his outraged dignity in\r\nbreaking up the curule chair of the praetor who would not rise to greet\r\nhim as he passed by.[726]\r\n\r\nAlthough, after the _provocatio_ had limited the right of inflicting\r\ndeath and scourging, the means of _coercitio_ were much the same for\r\nevery magistrate, a formal difference in its mode of exercise existed\r\nbetween the higher and lower magistrates, and between the magistrates\r\nwith _imperium_ and the tribunes. The consuls and other magistrates\r\nwith _imperium_ had the right of summoning delinquents before their\r\ntribunal (_vocatio_) as well as of summarily arresting them in person\r\n(_prensio_).[727] The quaestors and lower officials had neither of these\r\nrights; and the theory of the tribune’s being an exceptional magistrate\r\nwho should render assistance in person[728] was so far preserved that\r\nhe had only the right of arrest.[729] We sometimes meet with tribunes\r\nwho carried out their mandates with their own hands, but their presence\r\nalone was sufficient for the _prensio_ to be effective; in early times\r\nthey used their aediles for the act of violence, in later times their\r\n_viatores_.[730] By the close of the Republic the distinction was\r\nobliterated, and the tribunes, without formal right, summoned individuals\r\nbefore them.[731]\r\n\r\nA mere enumeration of the powers of the Roman magistracy throws little\r\nlight on the working of the civic constitution. The question which we\r\nshall now consider—the conflict of powers—is from this point of view more\r\ninstructive if only because it shows why Rome could not be governed by\r\nher magistrates.\r\n\r\nThe first ground of conflict was religious and arose from a use, or\r\nrather misuse, of the auspices, which we have hitherto refrained from\r\ndiscussing because it is only indirectly connected with the _jus\r\nauspiciorum_. It arose from a power possessed not by the magistrate\r\nonly but by every Roman citizen. It was the duty of any one who was\r\nthe witness of an evil omen (e.g. one of the _dirae_ belonging to the\r\nclass of _auspicia oblativa_) to give notice of this occurrence to any\r\nmagistrate about to embark on an important undertaking. The most frequent\r\noccasion on which such _obnuntiatio_[732] was employed was the holding of\r\nthe _comitia_. The respect paid to this announcement by the magistrate\r\nguiding the proceedings naturally depended on the position which the\r\nannouncer held in the state. The notice of a private and unknown citizen\r\nmight be received with suspicion; that given by an augur, who actually\r\nwaited by the _comitia_ to watch for such signs,[733] or by another\r\nmagistrate, would usually be respected. But, while the _obnuntiatio_ of\r\nthe augur, the plebeian magistrate, and the private citizen depended\r\non chance, that of the patrician magistrate could be the result of\r\ndesign. Observation of the heavens was, as we saw, the favourite form of\r\n_spectio_ of the urban magistrate, and the belief was strongly held that,\r\nif he asked a sign, the sign would come. The lightning which appeared\r\nmight be a lucky or unlucky omen for the magistrate himself; but, whether\r\nit appeared on the left or right, it was, as an _auspicium oblativum_,\r\nunfavourable to the holding of the _comitia_.[734] A patrician magistrate\r\nhad, therefore, only to give out that “he would observe the heavens” (_se\r\nservaturum de coelo_) to suspend all meetings of the _comitia_ and of\r\nthe _concilium_.[735] Hence the edict by which the consuls summoned the\r\n_comitia centuriata_ contained the words “ne quis magistratus minor de\r\ncoelo servasse velit.”[736] The patrician _obnuntiatio_ was a powerful\r\nweapon in politics, the counterpoise to the plebeian _intercessio_.\r\n\r\nThe uncertainty respecting the necessity for observing most of these\r\nreligious messages called for legislation; and about the year 153 B.C.\r\ntwo laws, the _lex Aelia_ and the _lex Fufia_, were passed which,\r\namongst other comitial regulations,[737] professed to give rules for\r\nthe _obnuntiatio_.[738] The import of these rules is quite uncertain,\r\nbut they seem to have recognised the right of the magistrate to watch\r\nthe skies to the detriment of public business, and to have attempted\r\nto define the value of the announcement made by plebeian magistrates,\r\naugurs, and perhaps even by private individuals. The scandalous use made\r\nof the auspices by the consul Bibulus in the year 59 B.C. was a shock to\r\nthe national conscience, and the ineffectiveness of his procedure gave\r\ncourage to the enemy. In the next year the tribune P. Clodius abrogated\r\nat least that portion of the law which bolstered up the misuse of the\r\n_spectio_; the _obnuntiatio_ was frequently employed as a political\r\nengine after this date, but its authors are tribunes and augurs,[739]\r\nwhich shows that it was in these cases based on the professed chance\r\nobservation of _auspicia oblativa_.\r\n\r\nThe other modes of conflict were based on powers inherent in the\r\nmagistracy; these were the right of prohibition possessed by the higher\r\nmagistrates over the lower, and the right of veto possessed by superiors\r\nover inferiors or by colleagues with equal powers over one another.\r\n\r\nThe right of prohibition was an outcome of _major potestas_ and was\r\npossessed by all higher over all lower magistrates. The tribune had it\r\nagainst all officials except the dictator; the consul against the praetor\r\nand against all magistrates with the exception of the dictator and the\r\ntribune. The magistrate’s right to forbid differed from the magistrate’s\r\nintercession in that the latter was levelled against a completed act and\r\n_rendered it invalid_; the former was merely a prohibition based on some\r\npower which the superior magistrate had in reserve; this power was the\r\ncoercitio, the use of which was threatened if the command was disobeyed;\r\nhence, if the _coercitio_ was not effectively put forward, _the act which\r\ncontravened the command was valid_.[740]\r\n\r\nThe scope of the exercise of this power was conditioned by circumstances;\r\nmost frequently the prohibition was directed against certain specific\r\nacts. The intercourse of a lower magistrate with the people, which had\r\nnot the approval of his superior, might be hampered by this means;\r\nthus the higher magistrate had the right _avocare contionem_ from the\r\nlower.[741] The tribune possessed it in a supreme degree, and it was a\r\ngrave infringement of his majesty when any other official called away\r\na portion of the people whom he was addressing.[742] The consul might\r\nhinder the praetor from introducing a _rogatio_,[743] and to guard\r\nagainst the possibility of the _obnuntiatio_ when he himself was holding\r\nthe _comitia_ consistently forbade him to consult the heavens on that\r\nday.[744] Other more glaring misuses of magisterial power were hindered\r\nin this way, such as the attempt to triumph without the consent of\r\nSenate or people,[745] or the effort to prolong a magistracy beyond its\r\nappointed tenure.[746]\r\n\r\nBut the prohibition might, under special circumstances, be far more\r\nsweeping than this; it might extend to the suspension of all the\r\nfunctions of a magistrate, or even to the enforced cessation of almost\r\nall the active life of the state.\r\n\r\nA higher magistrate, although he could not take away office from an\r\ninferior or even force him to abdicate, could visit a misuse of his\r\nfunctions by prohibiting all further action on his part. This power,\r\npractically amounting to a suspension from office, is found twice in\r\nour annals directed by the consul against the praetor—in one case for a\r\nbreach of respect, in the other for revolutionary proceedings.[747] Nor\r\nwas the power confined to Rome. The provincial governor had a similar\r\ncapacity for dismissing officials, who disgraced his administration, from\r\nthe country under his control.[748]\r\n\r\nA far more comprehensive act was the edict of a magistrate with _major\r\npotestas_ that all lower magistrates should suspend the exercise of\r\ntheir functions. Such a cessation of public business was known as\r\n_justitium_, a name derived from the suspension of that department\r\nof business which was the most constant sign of the active life of\r\nthe state, the courts of law (_juris statio_). The decree was usually\r\npronounced by the highest magistrate present in Rome who possessed the\r\n_imperium_, by the dictator,[749] or by the consuls[750]; and, as a\r\nrule, the _justitium_ was proposed on a vote of the Senate[751] and to\r\nmeet certain definite contingencies. The most usual circumstances which\r\ncalled for it were a sudden war, or a rising within the confines of Italy\r\nand its neighbourhood (_tumultus_),[752] or a public mourning following\r\non a national disaster, or the death of a distinguished man.[753] The\r\ncessation of the _justitium_ (_justitium remittere_[754]) was pronounced\r\nby a decree of the magistrate who had enjoined it.\r\n\r\nAlthough such a prohibitive order suspended the whole administration\r\nof justice both civil and criminal, was accompanied by the closing of\r\nthe _aerarium_,[755] and even by the cessation of the sittings of the\r\nSenate, it necessarily did not interrupt all the business of the state,\r\nfor it might be declared for the purpose of directing exclusive attention\r\nto some special sphere of administration. Thus in time of danger the\r\nmilitary levy went on,[756] and during the social war, while all other\r\njudicial business was suspended, the Varian commission still sat to\r\nperform its vindictive work on the friends of the allies.[757]\r\n\r\nSuch was the constitutional employment of this exceptional power. But its\r\nvalue as a political weapon was too obvious for it to fail to be part of\r\nthe armoury of the tribunes. We have seen the use to which it was put\r\nby the tribune Licinius;[758] and his example was followed in the last\r\ncentury of the Republic by his great successor in agrarian agitation, Ti.\r\nGracchus. In 133 he published an edict “prohibiting all other magistrates\r\nfrom transacting business until the voting on his law was finished; he\r\nput his own seals on the temple of Saturn, that the quaestors might not\r\ndraw money out or pay money in; he announced a fine that he would inflict\r\non praetors who ventured to disobey, so that each in terror abandoned the\r\nadministration which had been confided to him.”[759] The higher patrician\r\nmagistrates, the consul and praetor, could employ no such direct weapon.\r\nThey could, however, indirectly check the passing of a _plebiscitum_\r\nby assigning to a comitial day one of those movable feasts, the date\r\nof which was fixed by their authority,[760] and thus making it a _dies\r\nfastus_.\r\n\r\n_Intercessio_, though sometimes employed to describe the power of\r\nprohibition which we have just discussed,[761] is more properly applied\r\nto the power possessed, not only by higher magistrates, but by those\r\nof equal authority, of vetoing acts already performed by magistrates\r\nof equal or lower authority. It was an outcome, therefore, not only of\r\n_major_ but of _par potestas_, and its invariable consequence was the\r\ninvalidity of the act against which it was levelled. The intercession\r\naccompanied the _par potestas_ of the consuls; with the creation of lower\r\nmagistrates the conception of _major potestas_ as giving this power\r\narose, and the culminating point in the history of the intercession was\r\nthe creation of the tribunate. It was the great safeguard against illegal\r\nor inequitable acts performed by magistrates, who were irresponsible\r\nduring their year of office, and the tribune’s _major potestas_ over\r\nevery magistrate made him the guardian of the interests, originally of\r\nthe Plebs and later of the whole community.\r\n\r\nA veto to be valuable should imply some knowledge of the business vetoed;\r\nand thus we are not surprised to find that, except in the case of the\r\ntribune, the _intercessio_ was generally confined within the limits\r\nof colleagueship. Thus the dictator possessed it against the consul,\r\nthe consul against the praetor; although it is not improbable that the\r\nconsul could veto the acts of the aedile and quaestor who were not his\r\ncolleagues.[762]\r\n\r\nThe tribune, outside the bounds of his own college, could employ\r\nthe intercession against all the patrician magistrates except the\r\ndictator—against the consul, praetor, aedile, and quaestor. The growth\r\nof the Roman constitution, however, created magistrates between whom no\r\nrelation which justified the veto could be imagined to exist; none, for\r\ninstance, could be established between the aedile and quaestor or between\r\nthe consul and censor, and accordingly these magistrates had no power of\r\nimpeding one another’s actions.\r\n\r\nThree general limitations existed, which alone made this strange power\r\na practical working principle of the constitution. The first, which\r\nwas necessary to prevent utter confusion, was the finality of the\r\nintercession. The veto could not be vetoed, and the act which had been\r\ndeclared void could not be again made valid by the exercise of this\r\npower. A second was its purely _civil_ character; in the field divided\r\ncommand was not tolerated, and the intercession, therefore, did not\r\nexist. A third was that the veto could only be directed against what was\r\nclearly the act of a magistrate. We shall find instances of this rule in\r\nthe special applications of the intercession; an important consequence of\r\nit was that neither the verdict of a _judex_ in civil cases, nor, after\r\nthe growth of the standing criminal courts, of the _judices_ in these\r\n_quaestiones_ could be quashed by a magistrate.\r\n\r\nThe intercession may conveniently be considered from the point of view\r\nof three spheres of magisterial power against which it was directed—the\r\ndecree (_edictum_[763]), the _rogatio_, and the _senatus consultum_.\r\n\r\n(i.) The intercession might be directed against decrees of any\r\nkind—against those issued in the course of civil jurisdiction by the\r\npraetor, in the course of criminal jurisdiction by the consul, aedile,\r\nor quaestor, or in the exercise of other departments of administration\r\nsuch as the military levy. Intercession in all these cases rested on\r\n_appellatio_, the request for help (_auxilium_) made by the individual\r\nwho felt himself injured by the decree. The appeal had to be made\r\npersonally to the magistrate and the _intercessio_ exercised personally\r\nby him. Thus we find tribunes tracking the footsteps of consuls to offer\r\nhelp on the occasion of an expected levy,[764] and a praetor taking up\r\nhis position close to the chair of his colleague, waiting for appeals\r\nfrom his decisions.[765] In civil jurisdiction the _intercessio_ might\r\nbe employed at any stage of the proceedings before the magistrate\r\n(_in jure_); the appeal was usually from one of the city praetors to\r\nanother, although they might possess different judicial departments\r\n(_provinciae_).[766] The general principle was to give the mutual\r\nright of veto to magistrates possessing somewhat similar authority and\r\nknowledge. But this rule did not apply to the tribune. His interference\r\nwas directed against both civil[767] and criminal jurisdiction, and\r\nagainst the exercise of administrative power, especially that of the\r\nconsul. In such cases as the consular conscription or the quaestor’s\r\ncollection of the taxes,[768] it is not the general decree that is\r\nopposed by the tribune, but its application to individual cases by\r\nthe _coercitio_ of the magistrate. An appeal of this kind made to the\r\ntribunes sometimes became the subject of a quasi-judicial process,\r\nespecially if it had been made to the whole college.[769] A picture of\r\nthis process, which has been preserved, shows the appeal made from a\r\nconsular levy; the appellants and the magistrate appealed against appear\r\nbefore the benches of the tribunes (_ad subsellia tribunorum_);[770] the\r\n_collegium_ weighs the arguments and then gives its verdict, sometimes\r\nwith the grounds of its decision.[771] It is possible that the college\r\nmay in these cases have agreed to give the finding by a majority of\r\nvotes, although, if one tribune persevered in the veto, he might\r\noverrule the assent of all his colleagues.\r\n\r\n(ii.) The intercession against a _rogatio_, as contrasted with the power\r\nof forbidding a magistrate to question the people,[772] became at a very\r\nearly period of the Republic the exclusive right of the tribune. It might\r\nbe pronounced in any of the assemblies and against any kind of measure\r\nbrought before these assemblies—against elections,[773] against _leges_,\r\nincluding formal acts such as the _lex curiata_,[774] and against\r\n_plebiscita_.[775] Custom had caused the intercession against a _rogatio_\r\nto be guided by certain formalities; it seems to have been irregular\r\nto pronounce the veto before the day of voting had arrived,[776] and\r\nindeed before the speeches for and against the law had been made.[777]\r\nIn the case of laws, the correct time for interposing the veto seems to\r\nhave been the moment when the introductory acts of the magistrate were\r\nover and before the voting had commenced;[778] in elections we find the\r\ntribune interceding after the first tribe had voted.[779]\r\n\r\n(iii.) The intercession against a decree of the Senate (_senatus\r\nconsultum_) was in theory a veto of the magistrate’s decree on which he\r\nhad taken advice. It resided originally with the _par majorve potestas_.\r\nIt was exercised by the tribune against the tribune,[780] consul,[781]\r\nand praetor,[782] and throughout the greater part of the history of the\r\nRepublic by the consul against the consul.[783] The tribune possessed\r\nthe right of vetoing senatorial decrees at the time when he had not only\r\nno power of summoning the Senate, but not even a seat in the House. In\r\nearly days he placed his bench before the open doors for the purpose\r\nof examining decrees which were passed out to him and signifying his\r\napproval or dissent.[784] But, when in course of time the tribune\r\ngained the right of taking part in debate and of summoning the Senate,\r\nhis intercession came to replace that of the consuls; and although the\r\nconsular veto of a _senatus consultum_ continued to be employed long\r\nafter that against a _rogatio_ had ceased to be recognised, it is not\r\nfound after the time of Sulla (81 B.C.).[785] Here again the tendency was\r\nto make the tribunate the sole prohibitive power, and the tribune the\r\nsole guardian of the law.\r\n\r\nThe exercise of the veto in the Senate was simplified by the magistrate,\r\nwho intended to impede the resolution, signifying his intention\r\nbeforehand. This is the meaning of the declaration often made by a\r\nmagistrate in the Senate, e.g. by the consul, that “he would not\r\nallow any business to proceed” (_non passurum quicquam agi_).[786]\r\nThis declaration saved the time of the House, since the veto was not\r\npronounced during the debate, but usually after the voting on the\r\nmeasure[787] or while the voting was in progress.[788] Hence the veto\r\ndid not interrupt the procedure, nor even the threat of the veto suspend\r\nthe particular business. The motion on which the veto had been put was,\r\nif approved by a majority of the Senate, drawn up as a resolution of the\r\nHouse (_senatus auctoritas_). It had lost its binding legal force as a\r\ndecree, but it remained as an opinion for the guidance of any magistrate\r\nwho cared to respect it. Sometimes the Senate requested the magistrate\r\nto suspend the intercession (_intercessionem remittere_),[789] and\r\nsometimes attached to a particular decree a general vote of censure on\r\nany magistrate who should veto it.[790] The intercession on certain kinds\r\nof _senatus consulta_ might be forbidden by law. Thus the _lex Sempronia_\r\n(_de provinciis consularibus_) of 123 B.C. forbade the employment of the\r\nveto on the senatorial assignment of the consular provinces.[791]\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that, with this conflict of authority, there was no\r\ntrue theory of responsibility in the Roman magistracy; for that implies\r\na unity of power. But a description of what may be called the second\r\nelement of responsibility, the capacity for being punished, or for being\r\nforced to give compensation, for a misuse of functions, will form a\r\nfitting complement to the history of the intercession.\r\n\r\nThe civil and criminal responsibility of magistrates was enforced by the\r\nsame courts and the same processes by which ordinary citizens were tried.\r\nThe only privilege which they enjoyed was that, as a rule, they could not\r\nbe tried for a criminal offence during their year of office, and that\r\nnone but the magistrates without the _vocatio_ and _prensio_ (i.e. the\r\nquaestors and aediles) could be summoned into the praetor’s court.[792]\r\nThere was no special category of political offences which the magistrate\r\nalone could commit, although it is true that he was more specially liable\r\nthan ordinary citizens to be tried for certain crimes; his greater\r\ncapacity for doing harm to the state by cowardice or ignorance would\r\nexpose him more than the ordinary citizen to a charge of _perduellio_;\r\nbut the _judicium populi_ tried him as a citizen, not as a magistrate,\r\nand the general rule that a magistrate was exempt from prosecution\r\nduring his year of office made him, in fact, a _privatus_ when he stood\r\nhis trial. The commission of delicts, which were not cognisable by\r\nthe popular courts, would have brought him before the ordinary civil\r\ntribunals. If he robbed a citizen, it was _furtum_; if he assaulted him\r\nin a manner not justified by his power of _coercitio_, it was _injuria_.\r\nThere was indeed one delict which only a magistrate or an official could\r\ncommit—appropriation of the state funds. In very early times this may\r\nhave been brought under the expansive conception of _perduellio_, and\r\npunished criminally.[793] A few early laws, such as the fifth century\r\n_lex de ambitu_, were directed exclusively against magistrates or\r\ncandidates for a magistracy; these laws doubtless specified the penalty\r\nto be imposed,[794] but their interpretation was left to the ordinary\r\norgans of criminal justice, the _comitia_.\r\n\r\nBut, as the foreign activity of Rome increased, and greater individual\r\nresponsibility devolved on commanders distant from the centre of affairs\r\nand severed from all collegiate control, the possibilities of magisterial\r\nwrong-doing became too great to allow of the continuance of this simple\r\nsystem. The original theory was not, indeed, abandoned; the magistrate\r\nwas tried before the same civil and criminal courts as the ordinary\r\ncitizen; but the first step in the differentiation of ordinary from\r\npolitical jurisdiction was made when the initiatory steps in criminal\r\nproceedings against the magistrate were made the duty of a special\r\noffice. It was the tribunes who were now used by the state—that is, by\r\nthe Senate—as public prosecutors in criminal matters. It was a rough\r\nkind of justice which they meted out; the various charges which they\r\nbrought could hardly be described by specific names, and in few cases\r\nwas a penalty fixed by law. They formulated a punishment and brought it\r\nbefore the people, appearing as accusers either before the tribes or,\r\nwhen the penalty they proposed was a capital one, before the centuries,\r\nand the people, by a special legislative act, accepted or rejected their\r\nproposal.[795] Their superior _potestas_ and, when the injury was done\r\nto their person, their _sacrosanctitas_ gave them the legal right to\r\ncoerce any magistrate into appealing or to bring him to trial during his\r\nyear of office; but so strong was the feeling against this indignity\r\nto the magistracy that the veto of a colleague postponed the decision\r\nuntil the expiry of the official functions of the delinquent.[796]\r\nThis political jurisdiction was not, however, directed solely against\r\nmagistrates, but against any individuals who held an official position,\r\nagainst the staff-officers (_legati_) of a general,[797] against\r\nenvoys[798] and senators,[799] and even against the farmers of the\r\nrevenue (_publicani_).[800] The usual victims, however, were consuls\r\nand praetors, and the offences charged were mainly such as came under\r\nthe conceptions of treason,[801] or were open violations of the rules\r\ngoverning the magistracy;[802] but sometimes they were wrongs done to\r\nindividuals, such as might have come before the civil courts.[803]\r\n\r\nThe growth of Rome’s provincial territory made the continuance of this\r\nclumsy and casual jurisdiction impossible. The creation of the standing\r\ncriminal courts (_quaestiones perpetuae_), with their presidents and\r\njuries, was the reaction of the provinces on Rome. We shall speak\r\nelsewhere of the mixed character of these courts, which were formed of a\r\nfusion of ideas borrowed from the criminal and civil law. The earliest\r\nwhich were created supplied a readier redress and severer punishments for\r\nthe delicts of magistrates than the civil courts could give. Others were\r\nbased on the classification of political offences. The great codification\r\nof the criminal law effected by Sulla (81 B.C.) rendered the tribunician\r\njurisdiction superfluous, although it still reappeared at intervals\r\nduring the party struggles of the close of the Republic.\r\n\r\nWe have now reviewed every important aspect of the magistracy in general;\r\nbut before going on to describe the separate functions of the magistrates\r\nin administration, so far as these have not been already anticipated,\r\nit will be convenient to touch slightly on the formal conditions\r\nrequisite for holding office at Rome. These conditions often illustrate\r\nthe magistrate’s position in the state, and they sometimes create real\r\nlimitations on his power.\r\n\r\nThe qualifications for public office (_jus honorum petendorum_)\r\nwere based on the general principle that for patrician magistracies\r\nany citizen was eligible,[804] for plebeian only those of plebeian\r\nbirth.[805] But to this general rule there were certain limitations based\r\npartly on the idea of the dignity of office, partly on the view that\r\nexperience of a certain kind was necessary for the fulfilment of such\r\nresponsible functions.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, citizenship had not its private-law connotation.\r\nFreedmen may not have been _de jure_ excluded from office;[806] but\r\nthe lists of magistrates show that not only were the sons of freedmen\r\nineligible, but that the magistracy was practically reserved to those who\r\ncould boast a free grandfather.[807]\r\n\r\nIn the second place, certain careers were considered as a necessary\r\npreliminary to, others as a necessary disqualification from, the\r\nmagistracy. In a military city like Rome one is not surprised to find\r\nthat a certain amount of military service was demanded of one who might\r\nhave to lead the armies of the state, and that during the greater\r\npart of the Republic the _capite censi_ were wholly excluded from the\r\nmagistracy. The length of service required from the infantry soldier\r\nis unknown; from the _eques equo publico_ it was ten years’ service\r\n“in the camp or the province,”[808] as late as the time of C. Gracchus\r\n(124 B.C.).[809] This military qualification gives us a minimum age of\r\ntwenty-eight as being necessary for the holding of the quaestorship.\r\nIn the Ciceronian period, on the other hand, the age was thirty,[810]\r\nand the military qualification, although it still partially survived in\r\nmunicipal law,[811] seems to have been abolished for Rome. Conversely,\r\nthe exercise of any trade or profession for which payment was received\r\nwas a disqualification for office, as long as the trade or profession\r\nwas exercised.[812] This was, to some extent, an outcome of the prejudice\r\nagainst βαναυσία found amongst all military peoples;[813] but, as offices\r\nat Rome were unpaid, it was also a necessary provision for securing due\r\nattention to the discharge of the duties of the magistracy.\r\n\r\nThirdly, access to the magistracy might be hindered by the past moral\r\ndelinquencies of an individual or his criminal condemnation. It is a\r\nmistake to suppose that there was a definite class of _infames_ excluded\r\nfrom office at Rome. Certain criminal laws made temporary or permanent\r\nexclusion from the magistracy one of their sanctions. Exclusion on\r\nkindred grounds—notorious moral lapses of the candidate, his previous\r\ncondemnation in a disgraceful civil suit, the fact that a prosecution\r\nfor a crime was at that moment hanging over his head—was entirely\r\nthe work of the magistrate who presided over the elections. He acted\r\nentirely on his own discretion, although naturally on the advice of a\r\n_consilium_ of experienced men, in declining to receive the name of such\r\na candidate.[814] This remarkable power was the outcome of the still\r\nsurviving theory that the magistrate nominated his successor, and that\r\nthe election by the people was only a complementary act.\r\n\r\nOther limitations to the attainment of magistracy were determined by the\r\nprevious holding of office. The magistrate who presided over the filling\r\nup of a vacancy in the regular magistracies might not return himself as\r\nelected;[815] and two laws further provided that, if a new office was\r\nestablished by statute, neither the _rogator_ of the measure nor his\r\ncolleagues or relatives should be eligible to the post.[816]\r\n\r\nThe continuation and accumulation of magistracies were also forbidden\r\nby _plebiscita_ of the year 342 B.C., which enacted that at least ten\r\nyears must elapse between the tenures of the same magistracy, and that\r\ntwo magistracies should not be held together in the same year.[817]\r\nSuch legislation was the starting-point for a series of measures known\r\nas _leges annales_, which specified the order in which the various\r\nmagistracies must be held (_certus ordo magistratuum_),[818] the age\r\nwhich qualified for each, the interval which must elapse between the\r\nholding of any two, and that which must intervene between the holding\r\nof the same, magistracies. In the year 180 B.C. the _lex Villia_, a\r\n_plebiscitum_ of a comprehensive character, was passed, which specified\r\nthe age at which each magistracy might be held;[819] it appears also\r\nto have fixed the interval which must elapse between the holding of\r\ntwo patrician magistracies, since from about this period we find the\r\nbeginning of the rule, which held good in Cicero’s day, that a biennial\r\ninterval must be observed between the patrician offices in the _gradus\r\nhonorum_.[820] Finally, Sulla in 81 B.C. re-enacted the rules about the\r\n_certus ordo_ and the interval between the same magistracies by declaring\r\nthat the quaestorship must be held before the praetorship, and the\r\npraetorship before the consulate, and that ten years must elapse before\r\nthe resumption of the same magistracy.[821]\r\n\r\nThe validity of election was dependent on the observance of certain\r\nforms, the first of which was concerned with the presiding magistrate.\r\nWhile the tribune alone could be the president at the election of\r\nplebeian magistrates, the consuls and praetors created the _magistratus\r\npopuli_, but, as we have already shown in connexion with the\r\n_interregnum_, none but a consul could preside at the consular and\r\npraetorian elections.\r\n\r\nThe first act of the candidate was to send in his name (_profiteri_)\r\nto the magistrate destined to preside. This _professio_ had to be made\r\nthree weeks (_trinum nundinum, intra legitimos dies_)[822] before the\r\ndate of election. A list of the candidates was then prepared for the\r\npeople[823] after the magistrate had examined their names and satisfied\r\nhimself of the qualifications of the competitors. Up to the middle of the\r\nlast century B.C. the candidates need not be in Rome; but after the year\r\n63 B.C. some unknown law enacted that they should make the _professio_\r\nin person,[824] and a similar clause was again inserted in Pompeius’\r\nlaw _de jure magistratuum_ of 52 B.C.[825] During the interval between\r\nthe _professio_ and the election, canvassing, which had commenced long\r\nbefore the open profession of candidature, became brisker. Legitimate\r\n_ambitio_ almost rose to the dignity of a formal act. The aspirant, in\r\na dazzlingly whitened robe (_candidatus_), surrounded by a cortège and\r\naccompanied by a slave with a good memory for names (_nomenclator_),\r\naffably saluted all the citizens whom he met, and shook hands warmly\r\nwith the rustic voter. Rome’s habit of extending her franchise made the\r\ncountry vote always of some importance; but after the social war the\r\ncanvassing that followed the _professio_ was as nothing compared with\r\nthat which had preceded it. The municipal voters, who could not come up\r\nfor ordinary legislative business, flocked to Rome for the elections\r\nin the summer; and to secure success all Italy had to be sounded from\r\nthe Padus to the Lacinian promontory. Canvassing on this gigantic scale\r\nrequired time and an elaborate organisation. We find Cicero beginning\r\nto canvass on 17th July 65 B.C. for the consular elections in 64; and\r\nmen better circumstanced in birth, wealth, and rank commenced operations\r\nby setting in motion a vast machine, which had as its head some noble\r\ncoterie at Rome (_sodalitas_), and as its instruments the election agents\r\n(_divisores_), each of whom took charge of a portion of a tribe. The\r\nmeans used were not necessarily illegitimate, although the names of the\r\n_divisores_ became associated with bribery,[826] and a series of laws—not\r\nlonger, however, than the chain of enactments which Rome usually devoted\r\nto some special theme—strove by ever-increasing penalties to stamp out an\r\nevil which disappeared only with the popular assemblies themselves.\r\n\r\nAfter the people had chosen the new magistrate by their suffrage, a\r\nfinal duty had to be performed by the president in the shape of the\r\n_renuntiatio_, or formal announcement of the result of the election. That\r\nthis was not a purely formal act is shown by the president’s power to\r\nrefuse to return a legally, or even morally, unqualified candidate who\r\nhad slipped through the previous stages of election.[827]\r\n\r\nIf we believe that the king during his lifetime nominated his\r\nsuccessor,[828] there must from the first have been an interval between\r\nappointment to and entrance on office. This interval existed throughout\r\nthe Republic for most of the annual magistracies; only the dictator,\r\nthe censors, the magistrates created as the result of an interregnum\r\n(_ex interregno_), or those elected to fill up a place that had become\r\nvacant (_suffecti_), entered office immediately on their election. For\r\nthe ordinary magistrates there was a more or less considerable interval\r\nbetween election and entrance on office; for the patrician magistracies\r\nit had originally been short, for the elections were one of the last\r\nacts of the consul’s annual reign, and the new consuls and praetors\r\nentered office from the close of the third century on 15th March,[829]\r\nfrom 153 B.C. on 1st January.[830] But in the closing years of the\r\nRepublic—perhaps in consequence of a change introduced by Sulla—the\r\nelections were universally held in the month of July; and this gave a\r\nsix-months’ interval between election and entrance on office for the\r\nconsuls and praetors, and one of more than four months for the quaestors\r\nand tribunes, who assumed their functions on 5th and 10th December\r\nrespectively.[831]\r\n\r\nDuring this interval the magistrate elect was _designatus_, and, though\r\nhis _imperium_ or _potestas_ was necessarily dormant, he had a distinct\r\nposition in the state and could exercise certain official functions\r\npreparatory to the magistracy, such as issuing edicts, which would be\r\nbinding after his entrance on office.[832] Even before the _renuntiatio_\r\nhe had taken an oath of fealty to the state[833]—one, however, that could\r\nonly have been exacted when the candidate was present at the election.\r\n\r\nThe entrance on office was signalised by another promise on oath to\r\nrespect the laws (_in leges_)—a custom which probably grew out of the\r\npower of the people to bind either present or future magistrates by an\r\n_execratio_ to respect a certain _lex_.[834] Refusal to take it within\r\nthe period of five days was followed by loss of office;[835] only the\r\nFlamen Dialis, who might not swear, could claim exemption, and with the\r\npeople’s consent take the oath by deputy.[836] During the later Republic\r\nwe also find evidences of an oath which closed the tenure of office; the\r\nmagistrates, on the expiry of their functions, addressed the people and\r\nswore that, during their period of rule, they had wilfully done nothing\r\nagainst the interest of the state but striven their utmost to promote its\r\nwelfare.[837]\r\n\r\nThe assumption of the magistracy carried with it the right—and indeed\r\nthe duty—to exhibit certain external marks of dignity which distinguished\r\nthe masters of the community from their subjects. The lictors and the\r\nfasces were a survival from the monarchy, and were employed as a token\r\nof dignity and for the enforcement of the _coercitio_ by the magistrates\r\nwith _imperium_, on a scale, as will be seen when we describe the\r\ndifferent magistracies, proportioned to the strength of the _imperium_.\r\nThe other magistrates possessed only the servants—_scribae, praecones,\r\naccensi, viatores, servi publici_—necessary for the carrying out of their\r\nbehests.\r\n\r\nLike the lictors, the purple robe—the almost universal symbol of\r\nroyalty in the ancient world—and the curule chair were inherited by the\r\nRepublican magistrate; but the royal robe could be used only in the\r\ntriumphal procession, where the other regal _insignia_ were revived,[838]\r\nor for the celebration of festivals.[839] In the garb of peace of the\r\ncurule magistrates the purple had become a narrow hem (_praetexta_) round\r\nthe toga. The quaestors, who were not included in this list, seem to have\r\nworn no special dress; while the tribunes and plebeian aediles showed,\r\nby their complete lack of magisterial _insignia_, that they were never\r\nregarded as magistrates of the community.\r\n\r\nIn the dress of war the regal colour also reappears. Once outside\r\nthe _pomerium_ the magistrate may don the scarlet military cloak\r\n(_paludamentum_) worn over his armour. The dagger (_pugio_)[840] worn\r\nround his neck or on his waist, and the axes, which can now be enclosed\r\nin the fasces, were added signs of the untrammeled _imperium_.\r\n\r\nThe _insignia_ were not mere empty signs that bolstered up a power which\r\nwon no true respect. If the Senate appeared to the envoy of Pyrrhus to\r\nbe an assembly of kings, he was looking at a body the members of which\r\nhad for some period of their lives received the homage due to kings. The\r\nreverence for office as a holy trust, which is such a characteristic\r\nfeature of Republican forms of government, was heightened in the Roman\r\nmind by its genius for abstraction, which saw in the individual holder\r\nof power not the magistrate but the magistracy, and by its almost\r\nsuperstitious veneration for the forms of law. It was an obvious thing to\r\nRomans that they must spring from their horse when they met a magistrate\r\nriding,[841] that they must make room for him on the path, that they\r\nmust rise from their seat as he passed by, and that they must stand\r\nbareheaded before him in the _contio_ or the _comitia_. The occasional\r\nRoman, to whom these things were not obvious, was soon reminded of his\r\nduties by the _coercitio_ of the magistrate, who had the fullest means of\r\nprotecting his own dignity; his life had been made by the law as sacred\r\nas the life of the state itself, for an attempt on the safety of a Roman\r\nmagistrate was treason (_perduellio_).\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. _The Individual Magistracies_\r\n\r\nAfter this general review of the magistracy, we may glance at the precise\r\nplace in the state administration assigned to the separate magistrates,\r\nso far as the record of their duties has not been already anticipated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Dictator_\r\n\r\nThe only true mode of creating a dictator (_dicere dictatorem_) was\r\nthrough nomination by one of the consuls,[842] who, as we have seen, to\r\navoid unfavourable omens, pronounced his selection between midnight and\r\nmorning.[843] The question, which consul was to exercise this power,\r\nwas decided either by the possession of the fasces, which belonged only\r\nto the acting consul, or by one of the two favourite modes of settling\r\nquestions of collegiate action, agreement (_comparatio_) or the use of\r\nthe lot (_sortitio_).[844] But this purely consular function came in\r\ntime, like all extraordinary acts of administration, to be usurped by the\r\nSenate. At what period this result was attained we cannot say; for the\r\nannalists have transferred the constitutional observances of the third\r\ncentury B.C. to the earliest times.[845] Finally, the point was reached\r\nat which the Senate not only suggested the advisability of nomination\r\nbut the name of the nominee;[846] opposition to these instructions was\r\nconstitutionally possible,[847] but was borne down by the _de facto_\r\npower of the Senate with the tribunate as its instrument. By the close\r\nof the fourth century B.C. custom had further fixed the rule that the\r\nperson created should be a past holder of the consulship.[848] The\r\nancient provision that the dictator could be nominated only on Roman soil\r\nwas found impossible of observance, since the consul, when he received\r\nthe Senate’s message, was often far distant from the city, and _ager\r\nRomanus_ was, in true Roman fashion, liberally interpreted to include\r\nthe whole of Italy.[849] After the nomination of the new magistrate his\r\n_imperium_ was confirmed by a _lex curiata_.[850] The _insignia_ of the\r\ndictator were in one respect greater even than those of the king. As the\r\nconsul had inherited the twelve regal lictors, the dictator, in order\r\nthat his higher _imperium_ might be more clearly shown, was preceded by\r\ntwenty-four;[851] and the axes were seen with the fasces even within\r\nthe walls.[852] The dictator appointed to meet an emergency either of\r\nwar or revolution[853] bore no special designation which had reference\r\nto this emergency, but was aptly described as created for carrying on\r\nthe business of the state (_rei gerundae causa_).[854] But minor needs\r\nof peace might lead to the nomination of a dictator for a special\r\npurpose; we find a dictator appointed for holding elections (_comitiorum\r\nhabendorum causa_),[855] on one occasion for making out the list of the\r\nSenate (_legendo senatui_),[856] and others for purely ceremonial or\r\nreligious purposes—for the celebration of games (_ludorum faciendorum\r\ncausa_)[857] and the ordering of festivals (_feriarum constituendarum\r\ncausa_),[858] and for driving the nail (_clavus annalis_) into the\r\ntemple of Jupiter (_clavi figendi causa_),[859] an act of natural magic\r\nwhich was supposed to be a specific against pestilence. These dictators\r\n_imminuto jure_, appointed for a special purpose, were expected to retire\r\nas soon as the function was completed.[860] The six months’ tenure of the\r\ndictator _rei gerundae causa_[861] was never legally exceeded, but it\r\nmight be shortened, for it seems to have been necessary for the dictator\r\nto resign when the consul who had nominated him retired from office.[862]\r\n\r\nThe creation of a dictator did not abolish the other magistracies of the\r\npeople; it merely suspended their _independent_ activity. The dictator\r\nwas a _collega major_ given to the consuls, who still continued under\r\nhis direction to command armies,[863] and even those troops which were\r\nlevied by the dictator took the oath of obedience to the consuls as\r\nwell.[864] The praetors still sat in the courts, and lesser officials\r\ncontinued to perform the subordinate functions of government. But it\r\nwas felt that under a dictator all magistrates existed on sufferance,\r\nwith the exception of those of the Plebs.[865] It is certain that the\r\npresence of a dictator brought no legal diminution to the powers of the\r\ntribune; it is equally certain that constitutional custom dictated that\r\nthe _auxilium_ of these city magistrates should not be effective when the\r\nstate was under martial law.[866] Collision was necessarily rare since\r\nthe duties of the dictator took him far afield.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary power had yet some normal limitations. The dictator\r\nnever meddled with civil jurisdiction; and he had not the power,\r\npossessed by the consuls while in Rome, of taking money from the\r\n_aerarium_ without a decree of the Senate.[867] The government was\r\nnaturally unwilling that a magistrate to all intents and purposes a king\r\nshould wage war out of Italy; and there is but one example of a dictator\r\ncommanding in the extra-Italian world.[868]\r\n\r\nA further limitation to his original powers, and one of the greatest\r\nconsequence, was subsequently introduced. The dictator was made subject\r\nto the _provocatio_ within the city,[869] probably by the _lex Valeria_\r\nof 300 B.C.[870]—a change which, while not hampering the power of this\r\nmagistracy in the field, prevented its being used for ruthlessly crushing\r\na so-called sedition in Rome. Although we here see the commencement of\r\nthe infringement of its civil power, the military authority of the office\r\npersisted for a century longer. It was not until the Hannibalic war that\r\nthe two weakening elements of popular election and colleagueship were\r\nintroduced into this magistracy. In the year 217 B.C., when, after the\r\ndisaster at the Trasimene lake, it was difficult to communicate with the\r\nsole surviving consul, Q. Fabius Maximus was elected dictator,[871]\r\npresumably at the _comitia centuriata_ under the guidance of a praetor.\r\nIn the same year the distrust and misplaced confidence of the people\r\nraised M. Minucius, the master of the horse, to an equality of command\r\nwith Fabius.[872] Both acts were signs that the office was felt to be\r\nan anachronism, and the next year (216) marks the last instance of the\r\nmilitary dictatorship.[873] The last dictator (_comitiorum habendorum\r\ncausa_) was appointed in 202;[874] for the application of the name to\r\nSulla and Caesar was the transference of the title of a constitutional\r\noffice, in the first instance to a constituent authority, in the\r\nsecond to a monarchy, and in neither case was even the ancient mode of\r\nnomination preserved.[875]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Magister Equitum_\r\n\r\nEvery dictator, no matter for what purpose appointed,[876] nominated as\r\nhis delegate a master of the horse,[877] who, unlike other delegates,\r\npossessed the _imperium_, six fasces,[878] and a rank equal to the\r\npraetor.[879] These distinctions justify the assertion that he was a\r\nmagistrate,[880] and apparently one of curule rank, even though his\r\ntenure of power was strictly dependent on that of his nominator.[881]\r\nLike a magistrate he asked for a _lex curiata_ for the ratification\r\nof his _imperium_,[882] and he seems to have had power to question the\r\npeople and to transact business with the Senate.[883] In these three\r\nrespects the office differed from that of the _tribuni celerum_ of the\r\nmonarchy. As the dictator was a lesser king, the _magister equitum_ was\r\na greater lieutenant; but, in spite of the theoretical independence of\r\nhis position, his services were entirely at the disposal of the dictator,\r\nwho could enforce obedience to his commands, if necessary, by capital\r\npunishment.[884] Although originally employed, as the name signifies, for\r\nthe sole leadership of the _equites_ under the higher _imperium_ of the\r\ndictator, and always to some extent preserving his character of a cavalry\r\ngeneral, he could be entrusted by his absent superior with full command\r\neither in the camp or in Rome.[885] The office was a useful one, as it\r\ngave two generals of tried military capacity to Rome in time of danger,\r\nand obviated the disadvantages that might follow from the dictator’s\r\nhaving to use incompetent consuls or praetors as his subordinates.\r\nThis consideration also explains why, in order to secure experienced\r\nmen for the post, the custom became fixed of choosing ex-consuls or\r\nex-praetors.[886]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Consuls_\r\n\r\nThe consuls, after their election at the _comitia centuriata_, could at\r\nleast in later times assume the _insignia_ of their rank, and transact\r\nall the ordinary official business within the state without waiting\r\nfor the consent of the _curiae_. Their first act was the taking of the\r\nauspices; these were always favourable, for the _haruspex_ who stood\r\nby[887] announced, as a matter of form, that lightning had been seen\r\nupon the left. Armed with this consent they assumed the praetexta,\r\nand, preceded by their lictors, performed the first significant act\r\nof authority. This act was the summons of the Senate,[888] and was\r\none which showed that they were the magistrates who stood highest\r\nin the Roman executive. For, indeed, throughout Republican history,\r\nthe consulship—though in power it often yielded to the tribunate or\r\ndictatorship, and in the reverence it inspired to the censorship—was the\r\nhighest titular office in the state.[889] The rank of the consuls is\r\nsufficiently exhibited by the fact that it was chiefly by their names\r\nthat the years were dated,[890] and by the ceremonial respect which was\r\npaid to them by the other magistrates.[891]\r\n\r\nIn considering the functions of the consuls we must distinguish between\r\ntwo periods of the history of the Republic. The first extends from their\r\ninstitution to the year 81 B.C.; the second from this year, when the\r\nreforms of Sulla introduced a change in their position which was felt\r\nas long as consuls continued to exist. This change caused no alteration\r\nin their powers, but only in the scope of their activity. During the\r\nfirst period they are the heads of the whole state, and are found ruling\r\nwherever Roman energy extends; during the second they are practically the\r\nchief magistrates only of the city of Rome and of Italy.\r\n\r\nThe theory of colleagueship—that each individual member of a college\r\nwas vested with the fullest power of action subject to the veto of his\r\nassessor—did not necessitate a united activity of the consuls in every\r\ndepartment of state. They divided their functions, sometimes before\r\ntheir entry on office,[892] and in early times there are traces of the\r\nfundamental division of competence expressed by the terms _domi_ and\r\n_militiae_, one consul occasionally taking the field at the head of an\r\narmy, while the other remained at home to transact the business of civil\r\nadministration.[893] This arrangement, which divested colleagueship\r\nof its meaning as a safeguard against the rule of a single man, was,\r\nhowever, very unusual, and, as a rule, the consuls were present together\r\nin Rome or undertook a joint command abroad. But joint activity in the\r\ncity—even after the duties of registration had been given to the censor\r\nand those of civil justice to the praetor—was in some departments almost\r\nimpossible. It was obviated by a principle of rotation, which gave the\r\nadministration and the fasces for a single month to each consul in\r\nturn,[894] the elder of the two being given the symbol of power first,\r\nand the one who possessed it at the moment being described as _consul\r\nmajor_.[895] This distinction never wholly vanished; for Caesar, we are\r\ntold, revived in his consulship (59 B.C.) an old custom by which the\r\nlictors walked behind the consul who had not the fasces.[896] But long\r\nbefore Caesar’s time positive co-operation between the consuls in the\r\ncity was common. They summoned the Senate together, and many consular\r\nlaws bear the names of two rogators. There remained, however, several\r\nimportant acts which, while they, morally if not legally, demanded the\r\nassent of both consuls, could yet be performed only by one. Such were the\r\nelection of magistrates and the nomination of a dictator. In these cases\r\nthe question as to which consul should act was often decided by agreement\r\n(_comparatio_) or by lot (_sortitio_).\r\n\r\nIn all domestic matters, with the exception of civil jurisdiction\r\nand finance, the consuls were the heads of the administration,[897]\r\nand this, in the developed Republic, meant that they were the chief\r\nservants of the Senate. It was the consuls who regularly consulted this\r\nbody, who expressed its decrees, as well as commands which they had\r\na constitutional right to issue on their own authority, in the form\r\nof edicts, and who brought legislative measures, which had received\r\nsenatorial approval, before the _comitia_ of the centuries and of the\r\ntribes. It was they, too, who represented the state to foreign kings and\r\nnations and introduced their envoys into the Senate.\r\n\r\nConsular jurisdiction was of two kinds, administrative and criminal.\r\nThe administrative justice of the Republic was concerned chiefly with\r\nfinancial matters touching the interests of the community, such as\r\npecuniary claims made by the state on individuals or by individuals on\r\nthe state. The regular discharge of this duty passed to the censors; but\r\nin the gaps between the censorships it reverted to the consuls. We also\r\nfind them adjudicating on questions of property between the cities of\r\nItaly.[898] In this matter they doubtless acted on the instructions of\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\nThe criminal jurisdiction of the consuls was expressed in three ways.\r\nIt was for centuries, as exercised through the quaestors, the regular\r\ncapital jurisdiction for ordinary, as opposed to political, crimes;\r\nit was asserted, as part of their _coercitio_, with or without appeal\r\naccording to the nature of the sentence imposed;[899] or it might be\r\njurisdiction without appeal delegated by the people. We shall trace\r\nelsewhere the growth of a custom by which the _comitia_ assigned\r\njurisdiction on certain crimes to special commissioners. The people, who\r\nin this delegation were acting on the advice of the Senate, generally\r\nleft the appointment of the commission to that body, and the Senate\r\nselected either a consul or a praetor.[900] We also find the consul\r\npresiding over a criminal inquiry (_quaestio_) raised by a point of\r\ninternational law, such as the question whether the repudiation of a\r\ntreaty by the people should have as its consequence the surrender of the\r\ngeneral guilty of concluding it.[901]\r\n\r\nThe unlimited _imperium_ of the consul in the field (_militiae_), which\r\nwas asserted when he had crossed the _pomerium_[902] and required\r\nthe sanction of the _lex curiata_, was, in the early Republic when\r\nwars were confined to Italy, generally exercised by both the consuls\r\ntogether. To avoid the inconvenience and danger attending the rule of\r\ntwo commanders-in-chief of equal power, the principle of rotation was\r\nadopted, each consul having the supreme command for a single day.[903]\r\nBut this device was necessary only when military considerations dictated\r\nthat all the Roman forces should act together. Frequently the Roman\r\narmies had been simultaneously directed against various points of Italy,\r\nand the custom naturally suggested itself that each consul should command\r\nhalf of the regular army of four legions, and thus have an independent\r\nsphere of operations (_provincia_).[904] In a defensive war, such as\r\nthat against Hannibal, Italy would naturally fall into two consular\r\nprovinces;[905] but the practice became even more essential when the\r\nRoman arms extended beyond the peninsula, and in the period of the\r\nacquisition of the empire, from the beginning of the first Punic war\r\nto the close of the struggle with Greece (264-146 B.C.), _Italia_ as\r\na whole, and some foreign country such as Greece or Macedon, are the\r\nregular _provinciae_ held by the consuls.[906] The arrangements which\r\nwere made for the permanent government of provinces, first through\r\npraetors and afterwards through pro-magistrates, tended to arrest their\r\nemployment for this purpose; but down to the time of Sulla (81 B.C.) a\r\nconsul might at any time be appointed to a transmarine province.[907]\r\n\r\nThe consuls settled the distribution of _provinciae_ by agreement or\r\nby lot,[908] the _sortitio_ becoming in time the more usual practice.\r\nOccasionally the Senate ventured to suggest that one of the consuls\r\nwas better qualified for a special department, and in this case the\r\ninevitable consent of his colleague enabled him to assume it _extra\r\nsortem_.[909] But, as Rome’s activity extended, and the available\r\nmagistrates with _imperium_ increased, the important question came to\r\nbe, not who should have one of two departments, but which should be the\r\nconsular provinces. This power to nominate the provinces (_nominare\r\nprovincias_) had, by the close of the Hannibalic war, become the\r\nundisputed prerogative of the Senate,[910] and one of its surest modes\r\nof controlling the consuls. This _de facto_ power was formally recognised\r\nby a law of the tribune C. Gracchus in 123 B.C., although it scarcely\r\nrequired legal recognition, and the purport of the _lex Sempronia_ was\r\nto weaken the discretionary power of the Senate by enacting that the\r\nconsular provinces should be fixed before the election of the consuls\r\nwho were to hold them.[911] At this period the consular departments were\r\nalmost invariably foreign commands; but, after the close of the social\r\nwar and the reforms of Sulla, they were held by their recipients as\r\nproconsuls after their year of office at Rome had expired.\r\n\r\nWe do not know the exact tenor of the _lex Cornelia de provinciis\r\nordinandis_. Sulla did nothing to infringe the military _imperium_ of the\r\nconsuls; after as before his law it was legal for them to “approach any\r\nprovince”;[912] but he devised some means of separating home from foreign\r\ncommands, which, by crystallising the established custom, restricted the\r\nconsuls and praetors to the civil government of Rome and Italy, and sent\r\nthem out after their year of office as proconsuls and propraetors to the\r\nprovinces. The powers conferred by the military _imperium_[913] were\r\nthenceforth lost, and the consul at the close of the Republic had less\r\nspecific functions than any magistrate; even his criminal jurisdiction\r\nhad vanished before the establishment of the permanent courts. Yet still\r\nthe consul, who observed constitutional forms, was the chief interpreter\r\nof the Senate’s will; while one who, like Caesar in 59 B.C., violated all\r\nthese forms, might exercise an almost monarchical power. The possession\r\nof the consulship was the great annual prize, contested and almost\r\nequally secured by the conservative and the reform parties from the time\r\nof the Gracchi to the close of the Republic,[914] and the competition was\r\nnot wholly directed to secure the military _imperium_ which lay beyond\r\nit. The civil office might still make a capable man, supported by a\r\npowerful following, the guide of the destinies of the state.[915]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Praetors_\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the functions of civil jurisdiction were given to\r\na minor colleague of the consuls, and how a second colleague was\r\nsubsequently added to try cases in which the interests of _peregrini_\r\nwere involved.[916] The needs for judicial magistrates could not end\r\nhere. The provinces of Sicily and Sardinia, acquired as a consequence of\r\nthe first Punic war, required jurisdiction, and two praetors were given\r\nthem about the year 227 B.C.; two more were added in 198 B.C. for the two\r\nnewly acquired Spanish provinces, thus bringing up the full number to\r\nsix. A _lex Baebia_ (_circa_ 180 B.C.) enacted that four and six praetors\r\nshould be elected in alternate years, probably for the wise purpose of\r\nmaking the praetorian government of the difficult Spanish provinces\r\nbiennial; but this law was soon suspended, and six praetors continued\r\nto be annually elected until the time of Sulla (81 B.C.).[917] It is\r\ntrue that between 198 and 81 many provinces had been added to the Roman\r\nEmpire; but the principle of administration by pro-magistrates had gained\r\nrecognition while these were being created; the praetors were becoming,\r\nlike the consuls, more and more city officials, and the necessity for\r\nadding to their number came from the development of the criminal law.\r\nAt least eight praetors were needed for the presidency of the civil and\r\ncriminal courts at Rome, and consequently two were added by Sulla to the\r\noriginal six.\r\n\r\nThe variety of functions performed by the praetors was due to their\r\nhaving a general and a special character. On entering office, after\r\nelection by the centuries, they were at once, as inferior colleagues\r\nof the consuls, capable of any of the duties which flowed from the\r\n_imperium_. They were then assigned some special office, some definite\r\n_provincia_; but the exercise of this did not destroy their capacity\r\nfor general action. For command in war, as well as for the exercise of\r\nat least civil jurisdiction—both attributes of the full _imperium_—they\r\nrequired a _lex curiata_. Each had the right to six lictors, and appeared\r\nwith the full number when controlling a province outside the city;\r\nbut, in the exercise of his jurisdiction at home, he employed, or was\r\nallowed, only two.[918] The praetor’s specific title was derived from\r\nhis province; of the two original home praetors one was known as the\r\n_praetor qui inter cives jus dicit_, or, in the colloquial phrase which\r\nbecame titular, as _praetor urbanus_; the other as the _praetor qui\r\ninter peregrinos jus dicit_, known finally as the _praetor peregrinus_.\r\nBut both the home praetors were often spoken of as having _urbanae\r\nprovinciae_ and exercising _urbana jurisdictio_.[919] Their rank was\r\nhigher than that of their colleagues—hence their names were, like those\r\nof the consuls, used for dating[920]—and of the two the _praetor urbanus_\r\nwas regarded as holding the more distinguished position.[921] His duties\r\nwere naturally far more engrossing than those of his colleague, and the\r\nlaw that he must not be absent more than ten days from Rome during his\r\nyear of office[922] made him more of a distinctly civic official.\r\n\r\nThe powers of the praetors, taken in their natural order, may be divided\r\ninto (i.) their general administrative duties at Rome, and (ii.) the\r\nduties of their special departments. In the first of these spheres they\r\nacted in virtue of their own _imperium_ but _vice_ the consuls, and\r\ngenerally, therefore, when the consuls were absent from the city. If they\r\nacted when the consul was present, it was by authority of the Senate, and\r\nlegally the consuls might prohibit this action.[923] Such an injunction\r\nby the Senate was a constitutional mode of coercing the consuls into\r\ndoing their duty. In this way the praetors might summon the Senate,[924]\r\npropose a _rogatio_,[925] hold the levy,[926] and exercise criminal\r\njurisdiction delegated by the people.[927] Usually, however, such duties\r\nwere performed by them only in the absence of the consuls, and the\r\n_praetor urbanus_ generally took the lead,[928] although the summons of\r\nthe Senate by both home praetors, and even by a provincial praetor, was\r\nnot unknown.[929]\r\n\r\nThe special functions of the praetors were always assigned by lot\r\n(_sortitio_). During the period when some of the praetors governed\r\nprovinces, a regular sortition took the form of an assignment of the\r\ntwo urban _provinciae_ to two, and of the foreign provinces to two\r\nand afterwards to four members of the college.[930] But in the third\r\nand early part of the second centuries, before prorogation of command\r\nbecame the normal principle, and when Rome had few magistrates with\r\n_imperium_ at her disposal, this regular sortition could not always be\r\nobserved. Sometimes the two urban praetorships were combined,[931] or the\r\n_praetor peregrinus_ might be given an Italian command, such as Cisalpine\r\nGaul.[932] In this way a praetor could be spared for the command of the\r\nfleet or in Gaul (at Ariminum). This disturbance of the _sortitio_ and\r\nthe appointment of a praetor _extra ordinem_[933] were naturally the work\r\nof the Senate. After Sulla the two civil and six of the criminal courts\r\nwere assigned to the eight praetors by lot.\r\n\r\nThe civil jurisdiction, whether of the urban or provincial praetors,\r\nstill adhered to the ancient form by which the ruling in law (_in jure_)\r\nwas the duty of the magistrate, and the judgment on the question of fact\r\n(_in judicio_) was the function of a single _judex_ or, in matters\r\nrequiring rapid decision, of a bench of “recoverers” (_recuperatores_).\r\nThe rulings of the _praetor urbanus_ had originally followed the forms\r\nof the _legis actio_, but in matters affecting _peregrini_ a custom had\r\ngrown up for the praetor to devise formularies of action (_formulae_)\r\nwhich bound the _judex_ in his decision. The convenience of this\r\nprocedure extended its use to almost all cases, and by a _lex Aebutia_ of\r\nuncertain date the simpler formulary procedure almost wholly replaced the\r\nmore complicated provisions of the _legis actiones_.[934] The _formula_\r\nwas a conditioned acquittal or condemnation; the praetor said to the\r\n_judex_, “If it appears that a debt is due, an obligation has been\r\nincurred, etc., condemn the defendant in a certain amount or in a sum\r\nleft to your estimate; if the condition is not apparent, acquit him” (_si\r\nparet ... condemna; si non paret, absolve_). The _judex_ by his finding\r\nchanged the conditioned sentence into one that was categorical and final.\r\n\r\nIn most communities such rulings as those of the praetors would be\r\noccasional expositions of a fixed code or of an uncertain body of statute\r\nand customary law. At Rome a useful practice was adopted which brought\r\nthe living law, as opposed to the dead letter of her only code and to\r\nstatutes which had fallen into disuse, before the eyes of all the people.\r\nThe praetors announced by means of edicts, issued on their entrance on\r\noffice, what their rulings would be in any given case. The edict was\r\nthe “living voice of the civil law”;[935] and it is not surprising to\r\nfind that by the time of Cicero it had taken the place of the “song” of\r\nthe Twelve Tables in the legal education of the Roman youth.[936] The\r\nprofession of the edict was interpretation of the law of Rome; but it\r\nwas an interpretation that took the form of “assisting, supplementing,\r\nand even correcting the civil law.”[937] It was, therefore, not the\r\n_jus civile_ of Rome, but the valid modifications of this expressed in\r\nwhat was currently known as magistrates’ law (_jus honorarium_). The\r\ncivil law was of course presumed as the background of these documents;\r\nit found expression in many formulae which the magistrates continued to\r\ngive, and the _album_ itself probably contained a line of separation\r\nwhich showed where the formulae based on _jus civile_ ended and those\r\nfounded on magisterial promises began. The most typical language of the\r\n_jus honorarium_ is one of command veiled under the form of promises;\r\nthe praetor asserts “under certain given circumstances I will grant or\r\nwill not grant a case” (_judicium, actionem dabo ... non dabo_). Less\r\nfrequently the language is more imperative: “I will compel payment or\r\nan oath” (_solvere aut jurare cogam_); before the question of right is\r\ndecided, “I forbid force to be used” (_vim fieri veto_).\r\n\r\nA consideration of judge-made law, the consequence it may be of\r\nprecedents drawn from already decided cases, and therefore merely the\r\nrecognition of practice which had already crept into use,[938] but\r\nstill expressed, as it is in this case, in a purely abstract form,\r\nsuggests many questions. First, as to its validity. The edict was law\r\nthat held good for a year (_lex annua_):[939] a limitation that would\r\nhave produced a most unsatisfactory uncertainty as to its validity for\r\nfuture litigants and subsequent magistrates, had it not been for the\r\nfacts that it was actually continuous, and that it was received, only to\r\nbe slightly modified in accordance with legislative changes or with the\r\ndemands of convenience, by successive wielders of civil jurisdiction. To\r\nuse technical language, the edict was _perpetuum et tralaticium_.[940]\r\nSecondly, we must consider the limitation on the magistrate and the\r\nforces that bound him to observe his own promulgated law. At Rome the\r\nveto operated successfully for this purpose[941] even before the passing\r\nof the _lex Cornelia_ of 67 B.C., which obliged a magistrate to adhere to\r\nthe rulings of his own edict.[942] In the shaping of the edictal rules\r\nthe mere fact of publicity in a community so legally gifted as that of\r\nthe Romans must have sufficed to keep the magistrate within the bounds of\r\nprudence; when he was conscious of little legal training, the assistance\r\nof eminent jurisconsults must have frequently been called in.\r\n\r\nThe edict is the source of most of our modern Roman law; the titles of\r\nJustinian’s _Digest_ are often commentaries on its rubrics excerpted from\r\nthe writings of the scientific jurists, and that it should become the\r\nprototype of the world’s law was only natural when we consider the way in\r\nwhich it was built up. It was not only the collective work of generations\r\nof gifted men, who were fortunately not professing lawyers, but it was\r\nthe outcome of an adjustment of Roman law first with that of Italy and\r\nthen with that of the provinces. The beginnings of a recognition of a\r\n“law of the civilised world” (_jus gentium_) must be older than the\r\ninstitution of the _praetor peregrinus_, since for more than a century\r\nthe _praetor urbanus_ had been issuing edicts not merely for _cives_\r\nbut also for _peregrini_; but, when a separate comprehensive edict was\r\nissued for _peregrini_, equity found a more systematic expression, and\r\nits reaction on the comparatively rigid forms of the urban edicts was\r\nnecessarily great; but the power of this reaction was possibly even\r\nsurpassed by that of the provincial edict (_edictum provinciale_),\r\nissued originally by the foreign praetors and then by the proconsuls and\r\npropraetors in each of Rome’s dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe connexion of the praetors with criminal jurisdiction was, apart\r\nfrom the rare occurrence of a special judicial commission, due to the\r\ngrowth of the standing courts. These _quaestiones perpetuae_ or _judicia\r\npublica_ were to a large extent modelled on the civil procedure by which\r\ncompensation was exacted through a court of _recuperatores_. Hence the\r\npraetors seemed their most appropriate presidents, and the size of\r\nthe college was, as we have seen,[943] increased by Sulla to meet the\r\ngrowing number of these courts. For criminal jurisdiction six praetors\r\nwere available, whose provinces were possibly determined by the Senate\r\nand were certainly distributed amongst the designated magistrates by\r\nthe use of the lot.[944] Although the general principle of distribution\r\nmade each praetor preside over the jurisdiction ordained by a single\r\nlaw which created a _quaestio_, yet the spheres of jurisdiction were by\r\nno means fixed. Groups of _quaestiones_ or of their branches[945] might\r\nbe rearranged every year, and it may not even have been necessary for a\r\nsingle praetor to maintain a particular sphere of jurisdiction throughout\r\nthe whole tenure of his office. The general administrative functions of\r\nthe office might interfere with jurisdiction, and a readjustment of the\r\noriginal distribution of _provinciae_, probably with the consent of the\r\nSenate, seems to have been sometimes necessary.[946]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Aediles_\r\n\r\nThe junction of the plebeian and curule aedileships into a single office\r\nis testified by their being spoken of together where their duties are\r\nmentioned or prescribed by law,[947] and the fusion was so complete that\r\nit is sometimes impossible to discover whether a historical reference\r\napplies to the plebeian or to the patrician magistracy. But in their\r\nrespective qualifications for office, forms of election and _insignia_,\r\nthe separation was still complete. The plebeian aediles must still be\r\nplebeians, while the curule aediles belonged in alternate years to either\r\norder;[948] the former were elected by the Plebs, the latter by the\r\n_comitia tributa_ of the people; the former sat on the modest bench of\r\nthe plebeian officials and had no distinctive dress, the latter sat on\r\nthe curule chair and wore the _praetexta_;[949] the anomaly remained that\r\nthe one office was not a magistracy at all, the other a magistracy proper\r\nwhich gave its holder a claim to a seat in the Senate. The one peculiar\r\nprivilege of the plebeian aediles—the _sacrosanctitas_ which they shared\r\nwith the tribunes—vanished as a consequence of their employment as\r\nofficials of the state.[950]\r\n\r\nThe general position now assumed by the aediles was that of assistants to\r\nthe consuls in the administration of the city; in the fulfilment of which\r\ntask they had certain special spheres of competence assigned them.[951]\r\n\r\n(1) Their care of the state archives—originally possessed to a limited\r\nextent by the plebeian aediles[952]—was still continued, and they divided\r\nin some unknown way with the quaestors the custody of _senatus consulta_\r\nin the _aerarium Saturni_.[953]\r\n\r\n(2) The _cura urbis_ involved a series of duties connected with the\r\npublic sites, buildings, and functions of the city. The aediles had to\r\nsee to the paving of the streets, to insist on individuals keeping the\r\npathways before their own houses in repair, and to lease out at the\r\npublic cost the renewal of such thoroughfares as were connected with\r\npublic buildings.[954] They saw that all public places, such as roads and\r\nsquares, were kept clean and clear of obstacles, partly from a sanitary\r\nmotive, partly for the purpose of preventing the encroachments of private\r\nbuildings on public sites.[955] They controlled the water-supply and\r\nprohibited private persons, with the connivance of the water-inspectors\r\n(_aquarii_), taking more than their fair share from the public\r\nconduits.[956] Their control of public buildings and temples was limited\r\nto inspection and supervision, for the repair of such buildings, at least\r\nwhen undertaken on a large scale, was leased out by the censors. Closely\r\nconnected with this _aedium sacrarum procuratio_[957] was their control\r\nof the _cultus_ of the community, which obliged them to see that no\r\nforeign innovations crept into the primitive form of Roman worship.[958]\r\nTheir police duties are shown by the edicts which they issued for keeping\r\norder at the public games,[959] and by their control of private places\r\nof utility or amusement to which the public were admitted, such as baths,\r\ntaverns, and the like.[960]\r\n\r\nThe aediles possessed the usual means of _coercitio_ for enforcing\r\ntheir decrees; they seized pledges (_pignora_) and imposed fines\r\n(_multae_).[961] When the latter surpassed the limit of the _multa\r\nsuprema_, the case went on appeal to the people; the plebeian aediles\r\ndefended their fines before the _concilium plebis_, the curule before\r\nthe _comitia tributa_. From the _cura urbis_ also sprang an anomalous\r\ncivil jurisdiction which was confined to the curule aediles; in one\r\nform of civil action which survived in their edict as codified under\r\nHadrian—that, namely, arising from the damage done by wild beasts on the\r\npublic roads—it was they who gave the _formula_ and appointed the _judex_\r\nor _recuperatores_.[962]\r\n\r\n(3) Their care of the market is typified by Cicero in the most important\r\nof its subdivisions—the care of the corn-supply (_cura annonae_).[963]\r\nTheir duty was to regulate prices as far as possible, especially by the\r\nprevention of monopolies; the aediles often sold corn at a moderate price\r\nfixed by the state, although sometimes ambition led them to incur the\r\nloss themselves;[964] and it was they who as a rule presided over the\r\ndistributions ordained by the later _leges frumentariae_.[965] The supply\r\nof corn to an army in Italy from the city magazines was also one of their\r\ncares.[966] Other duties springing from their control of the market were\r\nthe enforcement of the sumptuary laws,[967] the inspection of weights\r\nand measures with the maintenance of their normal standard,[968] and the\r\nregulation of the sale of slaves and cattle. This power found expression\r\nin civil jurisdiction, which was in this case also confined to the curule\r\naediles. It was they who gave the _formula_ for the return of slaves and\r\ncattle sold under false representations, and appointed the _judex_ in\r\nsuch cases.[969]\r\n\r\n(4) The _cura ludorum_ of the aediles was not the mere presidency\r\nof festivals such as was possessed by other magistrates, but the\r\nestablishment of regularly recurring games, very largely at their\r\nown expense. The games were given jointly by the respective pairs\r\nof colleagues,[970] the oldest festival, the _ludi Romani_, being\r\nin the hands of the curule,[971] the _ludi plebeii_ in those of the\r\nplebeian aediles.[972] The other festivals established from time to\r\ntime—_Megalesia_, _Cerealia_, _Floralia_—increased the burden of the\r\naedileship. The Megalesia apparently fell to the lot of the curule\r\naediles,[973] the others seem to have been given indifferently by either\r\npair.\r\n\r\nThe aediles are sometimes found exercising functions of criminal\r\njurisdiction, all of which cannot be brought into close connexion with\r\nany of their special powers, and which, therefore, do not spring from\r\nthe ordinary _coercitio_. This criminal jurisdiction was, like the civil\r\njurisdiction of the curule aediles, an anomaly, for these magistrates did\r\nnot possess the _imperium_. It is to be explained partly as a survival\r\n(for some jurisdiction of the kind had been exercised by the plebeian\r\naediles) and partly as the result of considerations of convenience.\r\nBefore the institution of the _quaestiones perpetuae_ there was a great\r\nlack of criminal courts at Rome. The _quaestores_ were at hand for the\r\ntrial of grave capital crimes against individuals, and the tribunes for\r\npolitical jurisdiction. What was needed was a magistracy for bringing\r\nordinary and lesser crimes involving a money penalty (_multa_) before the\r\npeople, and this was found in the aedileship. It is true that the aediles\r\nwere not prohibited from undertaking the prosecution of political crimes\r\nthat might be met by a fine, such as a mild case of _majestas_[974] or\r\nthe bribery of a bench of _judices_;[975] and judgment on a breach of\r\nthe peace (_vis_) was in harmony with their police duties.[976] But as a\r\nrule it is a class of ordinary crimes, somewhat beneath the dignity of\r\ntribunician prosecution, that we find them visiting. Such were adultery\r\ncommitted either by men or women,[977] usury,[978] illegal speculations\r\nin corn,[979] and the offence of exceeding the amount of domain-land\r\nwhich the laws permitted an individual to possess.[980] The aediles\r\nwere stimulated to a career of prosecution by the singular custom which\r\npermitted them to retain the fines collected and to apply them to any\r\npublic purpose which they pleased. We find them expended on buildings and\r\nadornments of the city, and by the plebeian aediles on their games.[981]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Quaestors_\r\n\r\nWe have already spoken of the criminal investigators (_quaestores\r\nparricidii_), whom tradition attributes to the monarchy,[982] and of the\r\nmore certain assistants of the consuls for criminal jurisdiction and\r\nfinance (_quaestores parricidii et aerarii_), who are assigned to the\r\nearly Republic.[983] We have seen that, first nominated by the consuls,\r\nthey were soon elected by the tribes,[984] and we have witnessed the\r\nopening of the office to Plebeians when, in 421 B.C., the number of\r\nquaestors was raised from two to four, and one of these officials was\r\nassigned to each consul in the field.[985] About the year 267 B.C.\r\nfour more were added for the purposes of Italian administration, and\r\nno further change is recorded until Sulla raised their number to\r\ntwenty,[986] although some intermediate increase is not improbable.\r\n\r\nAfter the quaestorship had become an independent magistracy, its tenure\r\ncontinued to be annual; but the consular quaestor is so much a part of\r\nhis superior that, after the prolongation of the _imperium_ had become\r\nusual, a biennial tenure, held partly in Rome, partly in a province,\r\nmust have been the rule.[987] The rank of the quaestor was the lowest\r\nin the _cursus honorum_,[988] and he had none of the _insignia_ of the\r\ncurule magistrates. Coins exhibit him on a straight-legged chair, with\r\na money-bag or money-chest, and a staff the significance of which is\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nThe quaestorian _provinciae_ were determined, before these magistrates\r\nentered on their office, by a decree of the Senate,[989] and the\r\nindividuals were then assigned to their several departments by lot;\r\nalthough, probably always by a special grace of the Senate, there are\r\ninstances of commanders selecting their own assistants.[990]\r\n\r\nThe departments may be grouped under the three heads of urban, military,\r\nand Italian.\r\n\r\n(i.) The general duty of assistance which the two urban quaestors\r\n(_quaestores urbani_) rendered to the consuls was curtailed of one of its\r\nattributes by the loss of their criminal jurisdiction about the middle\r\nof the second century B.C.; for they could no longer have been needed\r\nas delegates in _parricidium_ after the first _quaestio de sicariis_\r\nhad been established.[991] Their functions were henceforth, as they had\r\nfor some time mainly been, financial. Their old association with the\r\n_aerarium_ gave them the custody of the keys of this treasury,[992] the\r\nguardianship of the standards that were kept there,[993] and, above\r\nall, of the great mass of state papers and archives which it held.\r\nThese contained laws[994] and decrees of the Senate,[995] the list of\r\n_judices_,[996] the public accounts (_tabulae publicae_), which included\r\nthe statements of moneys voted to magistrates[997] and the reckoning of\r\nprovincial governors with the _aerarium_ in respect to direct tribute\r\npaid them by the provincials. Connected with this financial custody were\r\nthe quaestors’ duties of collection. To them the _publicani_ usually\r\npaid the sums which they had guaranteed for the leasing of the public\r\nrevenues.[998] The collection of fines imposed by the _judicia populi_,\r\nand exacted by the _quaestiones_ for peculation and extortion, was also\r\nin their hands.[999]\r\n\r\nThe quaestors also conducted sales on behalf of the treasury—not of those\r\nlarge portions of the public domain which were alienated by the censors,\r\nbut of current acquisitions, such as those of slaves and booty captured\r\nin war,[1000] and of that portion of conquered land which was brought\r\nimmediately under the hammer (_ager quaestorius_).[1001] This threefold\r\nfunction of guardianship, collection, and sale gave the urban quaestors\r\nan unequalled grasp of the state of the public revenues, and as they\r\nwere annual, while the censors—the budget-makers—were merely occasional\r\nofficials, we are not surprised to find them making financial statements\r\nin the Senate.[1002]\r\n\r\n(ii.) The general assistance which the quaestors were meant to render to\r\nthe consuls was extended, as we saw,[1003] in the year 421 B.C. to their\r\nactivity in the field. Each consul or praetor who assumed a military\r\ncommand was given a particular quaestor (the dictator being exempted\r\nfrom what was regarded as a limitation on the discretionary powers of\r\nthe magistrate), and, after the custom had grown up of extending the\r\n_imperium_, these assistants accompanied the proconsuls and propraetors\r\nto their provinces. The term of the quaestorship was prolonged with that\r\nof the office with which it was associated,[1004] for the connexion\r\nbetween the superior and inferior was regarded as being of almost as\r\npersonal a character as that between father and son.[1005] We shall\r\nexamine the relation more minutely when we come to deal with provincial\r\norganisation. It is sufficient to remark here that, though the quaestors’\r\nfunctions were mainly financial, they were in all other respects true\r\nadministrative delegates of the magistrates with _imperium_,[1006] and\r\nwere constantly employed on judicial and military business.\r\n\r\n(iii.) The quaestors of Italy were probably identical with those of\r\nthe fleet (_classici_), and were a result of the organisation of Italy\r\nwhich followed the war with Pyrrhus (267 B.C.). For the purposes of the\r\nPyrrhine war twelve quaestors were created, whose number, when they\r\nwere given permanent stations, was reduced to four.[1007] Three of\r\nthese stations can be approximately determined. One was Ostia, and the\r\ntenure of this post was burdened with the duty of the supply of corn\r\nto Rome.[1008] The second appears to have been the woods and forests\r\n(_calles_) of Italy.[1009] The third was in Cispadane Gaul,[1010]\r\nperhaps at Ravenna or Ariminum. The fourth is unknown, but was perhaps\r\nthe quaestorship at Lilybaeum in Sicily, which, after the creation of\r\nthe first Sicilian praetor in 227 B.C., would have become a provincial\r\npost. The other three survived the Republic as spheres of Italian\r\nadministration.[1011] The functions of these quaestors were chiefly\r\nthe levying of contingents from the allies in ships and men,[1012] the\r\nprotection of the coasts, and at Ostia, as we have seen, the supply of\r\ncorn for the capital.\r\n\r\nA further quaestorian department is mentioned by Cicero—the _provincia\r\naquaria_, which was probably concerned with the water supply of the\r\ncapital. It is uncertain whether this function was attached to one of the\r\nItalian quaestorships.[1013]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Censors_\r\n\r\nWe have already described the institution of the censorship in 443\r\nB.C.,[1014] and have seen that patrician rank was originally a necessary\r\nqualification for the post. The first mention of a plebeian censor is\r\nin 351 B.C.[1015] One of the Publilian laws of 339 B.C. is said to have\r\nextended to the censorship the provision of the Licinian law about the\r\nconsulship, and to have enacted that one censor must be a Plebeian;[1016]\r\nbut it is not until the year 131 B.C. that we find two plebeian\r\ncensors.[1017]\r\n\r\nThe election to this office, like that to the other higher magistracies,\r\ntook place in the _comitia centuriata_[1018] under presidency of the\r\nconsul. The election was then ratified, not, as in the case of other\r\nmagistrates, by a _lex curiata_, but by a _lex centuriata_,[1019] a form\r\nof statutory approval which marks the censors as peculiarly the officials\r\nconcerned with the organisation of the _exercitus_.\r\n\r\nIn rank the censor occupies an anomalous position. Although lacking the\r\n_imperium_ and the right of summoning people and Senate, he is reckoned\r\namongst the _majores magistratus_, he has the “highest _auspicia_,”[1020]\r\nhe sits in the curule chair, wears the purple-striped toga, and (an\r\nhonour accorded to no other magistrate) is buried in the full purple of\r\nthe king.[1021] Politically the censorship was the apex of a career.\r\nOften held in its earlier period by ex-consuls, it became practically\r\nconfined to the consular, and its enormous powers, its lofty ethical\r\nsignificance, and its comparative infrequency made it the goal of those\r\nwho had already attained the chief titular dignity of the state.\r\n\r\nFour attributes of the office are very important in determining its\r\ncharacter. The first gave it the necessary authority, the others created\r\na healthful limitation of its powers.\r\n\r\n(1) The censorship was an irresponsible office.[1022] Its holders could\r\nnot be called to account for any act done in connexion with the _census_,\r\nany act that was an outcome of the _censoria potestas_ ratified by\r\nthe _lex centuriata_; and although the _lectio senatus_ was a later\r\naddition to their functions, this power seems to have been included in\r\nthe indemnity. This principle of immunity was stated in a decree of\r\nthe Senate of the year 204 B.C.,[1023] and, although often challenged\r\nby the tribunes, was maintained until the close of the Republic. One\r\nof the effects of the Clodian _plebiscitum_ of 58 B.C., which limited\r\nthe discretionary power of the censors in the _regimen morum_,[1024]\r\nwould have been to make them judicially responsible for a breach of its\r\nprovisions; but this law was soon repealed. The censors were also free\r\nfrom the usual limitation created by the tribunician intercession; it\r\nwas clearly invalid against the particular _potestas_ exercised at the\r\n_census_,[1025] although the _obnuntiatio_ could be employed against the\r\nsummons of the people to the _census_ and the _lustrum_, as against any\r\nother _contio_.[1026]\r\n\r\n(2) The limitation of tenure to eighteen months caused a break in the\r\ncontinuity of the magistracy, and was a symbol that the office was\r\nmerely occasional. The censorial ordinances were valid for the whole\r\nquinquennial period of the _lustrum_, but, whatever may have been the\r\noriginal intention of the limitation of tenure, it was continued as an\r\neffective guarantee against such enormous powers being exercised for a\r\ncontinuous period of four or five years.[1027]\r\n\r\n(3) Re-election to the censorship was forbidden, for a continuous moral\r\ncontrol exercised by the same men would have been intolerable.[1028]\r\n\r\n(4) The collegiate principle operated here as in other offices, but\r\nnowhere was the check of the veto more necessary and more healthy than in\r\nits influence on the arbitrary moral judgments of the censors. Without\r\nit the Senate might have been packed by a single man, and degradation\r\nfrom the highest positions and on the scantiest evidence might have\r\nbeen due to caprice, and followed by the unpopularity which divided\r\nresponsibility renders less intense.[1029] The collegiate relation\r\nwas, indeed, closer in this than in any other magistracy. Its holders\r\nmust be elected together, the name of the singly-appointed censor not\r\nbeing returned;[1030] and, whether from grounds of convenience or from\r\na religious scruple, it was enacted that, if one post was vacated by\r\nabdication or death, the holder of the other should resign.[1031]\r\n\r\nThe original and specific powers of the censors, various as they\r\nseem, form a perfect unity. Their work is briefly that of numbering\r\nand purifying the people. The accompaniments of this _census_ are\r\n(i.) registration, i.e. the assignment of individuals to their proper\r\nstate-divisions; (ii.) the decision of the incidence of financial\r\nburdens, based on an estimate of the property of individuals; (iii.) the\r\nconsideration of the moral worth of individuals with reference to their\r\nfitness to exercise various functions of state, known generally as the\r\n_regimen morum_; (iv.) the purification (_lustrum_), perhaps to avert\r\nthe anger of the gods from the iniquity of numbering the people, perhaps\r\nmerely a regularly recurring atonement for involuntary sin, the voluntary\r\nsinners being first removed by the exclusion effected by the _cura morum_.\r\n\r\nTo this aggregate two functions were added: first, the _lectio\r\nsenatus_, which, although no part of the _census_, is an outcome of\r\nthe same activity and forms an integral part of the _regimen morum_;\r\nsecondly, financial duties, such as the leasing of taxes and _opera\r\npublica_—functions that any of the supreme magistrates could perform.\r\nThey are not an integral part of the _census_, and this portion of the\r\ncensors’ business is conducted under senatorial supervision.[1032]\r\n\r\nI. The _lectio senatus_, although in the eyes of the censors and of the\r\nworld the first of their charges, was but a late attachment to their\r\noffice. Even in the year 311 B.C. the consuls could still venture to set\r\naside a censorian list and return to the practice of selecting their\r\nown _consilium_,[1033] and later still (216 B.C.) a dictator could be\r\nchosen for the purpose of filling up gaps in the order.[1034] A _lex\r\nOvinia_, a _plebiscitum_ of uncertain date, may have made the censors\r\nmainly responsible for the _lectio_, but the fragmentary paraphrase of\r\nits contents, which has been preserved, merely limits their discretionary\r\npower in the exercise of their choice. The censors are to choose “the\r\nbest men,” a direction which, interpreted by our knowledge of later\r\nmethods of selection, implies at the least that ex-curule magistrates\r\nmust be chosen,[1035] at the most that the whole list of magistrates\r\n(including the plebeian aediles and the quaestors) should be scrutinised\r\nbefore censorian nominees were appointed.[1036]\r\n\r\nThe framing of the Senate’s list was, in accordance with the estimate\r\nof its importance, the first work of the censors after their entrance\r\non office. It was accomplished rapidly, for there was no summoning of\r\nthe Senate as a corporation, or even of individuals, as at the _census_.\r\nFacilities may have been offered to a senator of clearing himself of\r\ncharges,[1037] but formal procedure was dispensed with, and nowhere was\r\nthe arbitrary power of the censors more manifest than in the execution of\r\nthis the gravest of their duties.\r\n\r\nRejection took the form of affixing marks (_notae_) against names in the\r\nregister; these names were omitted in the revised list. Then took place\r\nthe _sublectio_ of new names, and here the censure was pronounced by\r\nomitting those who had a claim to a seat in the house.[1038] The veto,\r\nwhich operated in its constantly negative manner, which enabled one\r\ncensor to retain a name omitted by the other,[1039] or even perhaps to\r\nhinder the election of a new member selected by his colleague, and the\r\nwritten grounds for censure appended to the rejected name (_subscriptio\r\ncensoria_),[1040] were some guarantees against capricious exclusion.\r\n\r\nThe automatic method of recruiting the Senate introduced by Sulla\r\nproduced a modification in the censorian selection. The magistrates seem\r\nto have lost the power of rejecting applicants, their right of exclusion\r\nbeing confined to names already on the list. It is not known whether the\r\ncensors at a subsequent _lustrum_ still retained the power of reversing\r\nan _infamia_ once pronounced; but the usual mode in which a seat was\r\nregained by an ejected senator was to seek popular election and to enter\r\nthe Senate through a magistracy.[1041]\r\n\r\nII. The _census_ opened with a summons to the people to meet the censors\r\nin the Campus Martius. It was the army as exhibited in the centuriate\r\nlist that the censors wished primarily to examine, and, consequently, it\r\nwas the members of this body that they summoned to appear in person; the\r\n_capite censi_, with their votes in the tribes and their taxable capital,\r\nmight be represented only by the _curatores tribuum_,[1042] although\r\nthe censor could summon any member of the burgess community whom he\r\npleased.[1043]\r\n\r\nThe financial examination at each _census_, which had as its object\r\nthe rating for the _tributum_, was based on the returns of the last\r\nscrutiny. There was, therefore, some means of checking the declarations\r\nnow made on oath by each head of a family, and in doubtful cases external\r\nevidence must have been taken. The returns were made in accordance with\r\nthe instructions of a general formula (_lex censui censendo_) which the\r\ncensors had published;[1044] but their general conditions must always\r\nhave been the same. First came a declaration of the size of the property,\r\nthen of its value. But the estimate of the individual owner need not be\r\naccepted by the censors; they often attached an exaggerated estimate to\r\narticles of luxury,[1045] or expressed their disapprobation of social or\r\nmoral offences by an arbitrary and excessive rating of the goods of the\r\noffenders.[1046]\r\n\r\nAll the property thus assessed must be the object of quiritarian\r\nownership. Originally it had been but the land and the animals associated\r\nwith it (_res mancipi_),[1047] such objects as had been conveyed by\r\nmancipation, and for the evidence of the transfer of which from hand\r\nto hand the mancipation witness could be summoned. But the growing\r\nmercantile community had to take account of movables, and throughout the\r\nhistorical period all objects of property, corporeal or incorporeal,\r\nwhich constituted _pecunia_ in the later sense of the word, were subject\r\nto valuation and taxation.[1048] After the time when direct taxation\r\nceased in Italy (167 B.C.) the valuation was no longer made for the\r\n_tributum_; but property was still for a time the determinant of the\r\nkinds of military service and voting rights, and the censors had still\r\nto scrutinise the professions of the assessed, although the scrutiny was\r\nperhaps conducted with less rigour than before.\r\n\r\nAs it was the head of the family alone that could give an account of\r\nproperty, so it was to him that the censor put the requisite questions\r\nas to the persons dependent on his care. The respondent gave not only\r\nhis own name, his father’s and his age, but made similar declarations\r\nabout his son, his daughter, and his wife.[1049] Inquiries about the\r\nfemale members of the family were chiefly undertaken on moral grounds;\r\nthey were of no importance for the work of registration, whose object was\r\nto assign voting rights and military burdens. Of the three subdivisions\r\nof the Roman state—the _curia_, the tribe, the century—the first was\r\nnot considered by the censor, for the _curia_, like the _gens_, was\r\ninherited. The assignment of the tribe varied at different periods. If\r\nthere was never a time in the history of the censorship when it had\r\nbeen confined to landholders,[1050] the possessor of an allotment was\r\nnaturally registered in the _tribus_ which contained his plot of ground,\r\nthe non-possessor in that wherein he dwelt. But, by the year 312 B.C.,\r\nthe landless citizens had already been confined to the four urban tribes;\r\nthe radical censor of that year distributed them even over the country\r\ntribes, to increase the voting power of this _forensis factio_;[1051]\r\nbut in 304 B.C. the landless proletariate was again confined to the\r\n_tribus urbanae_,[1052] and hence arose the permanent distinction between\r\nthe more honourable country and the less distinguished city tribe. As\r\na matter of fact, this distinction between the landed and the landless\r\ncitizen could not continue when all property, personal as well as real,\r\nbecame of equal value at the _census_, and membership of the tribe\r\nbecame practically hereditary. But it was a heredity which might be\r\nbroken by the censor at every period of registration. He might, as we\r\nshall see, arbitrarily transfer an individual from his paternal country\r\ntribe to one of the four urban divisions, which, partly from historical\r\nreasons, partly because they contained the freedmen, were accounted less\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\nThe distribution into centuries naturally followed the distinctions of\r\nproperty and age which qualified for those bodies. The list which set\r\nforth this distribution was still pre-eminently an army list, but the\r\ntable of seniors (_tabulae seniorum_) undoubtedly contained the names of\r\nthose who were past the age of compulsory service. The _sexagenarii_,\r\nalthough the young bloods might object to their voting for a war in which\r\nthey were not to share,[1053] or electing a general by whom they would\r\nnot be led, still had the right of taking part in the deliberations of\r\nthe _comitia centuriata_.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the complete census of tribes and centuries included\r\nevery voting unit of Rome, and, in spite of the fact that an individual\r\nscrutiny of the _aerarii_ may not have taken place,[1054] we must suppose\r\nthat there was a tribal list of _all_ the citizens which proved the right\r\nto vote at the _comitia tributa_ and the _concilium plebis_. But it is\r\nalmost certain that, when an historian mentions a census of Republican\r\ntimes, he is reproducing merely the army list,[1055] the vital element\r\nin registration for a military state. All under the military age are\r\nexcluded, and it has even been concluded that in the historical lists\r\nthe _seniores_ themselves are not entered.[1056] The _proletarii_ are\r\npotentially, and in a sense actually, members of the Roman army;[1057]\r\nbut it is very questionable whether they appear in the Republican lists.\r\nIt was, perhaps, not until the Principate that the census contained the\r\nnames of all male Romans above the military age.[1058]\r\n\r\nIII. _The recognitio equitum._—The word _equites_ primarily and properly\r\napplied only to the citizen cavalry of 1800 men, serving on horses\r\nsupplied by the state.[1059] These formed the _centuriae equitum equo\r\npublico_, and this class was the _ordo equester_ in the strict sense.\r\n\r\nIt is true that _equites_ had come to have a wider meaning than this.\r\nAbout the close of the fifth century, individuals possessing a certain\r\ncensus and not included in the equestrian centuries were permitted to\r\nserve as cavalry with their own horses.[1060] They were no definite body,\r\nbut were selected for a particular service by the commander, if the\r\ncensors had admitted their pecuniary qualification.[1061] The consequence\r\nwas that the terms _eques_ and even _ordo equester_ were transferred to\r\nthese potential knights, and came to specify all who possessed a certain\r\ncensus, which, in the Principate and probably in the later Republic,\r\nwas 400,000 sesterces.[1062] The censorship was only concerned with\r\nthis wider body of knights as the authority which proved the monetary\r\nqualification of its individual members. The only body of _equites_ which\r\nit recognised and treated as a corporation was that of the eighteen\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nThe review of the knights (_equitum census_,[1063] _recognitio\r\nequitum_[1064]) took place, not like that of the rest of the citizens\r\nin the Campus Martius, but in the Forum. The whole corps filed past\r\nthe censor man by man, each knight leading his horse by the bridle,\r\nas the herald called his name.[1065] The first question considered by\r\nthe censors was that of discharge. While the knights were still the\r\ncavalry of Rome, the service was a burden, and a burden that from the\r\nclose of the second century of the Republic was made incompatible with\r\na seat in the Senate.[1066] In the Gracchan period, as we have seen,\r\nten years’ service had to be proved before the knight could claim his\r\ndismissal.[1067] The discharge was usually granted, if the conditions had\r\nbeen fulfilled, but the censors, as a penal measure, claimed the right\r\nof not allowing past service to count, and even of imposing additional\r\nservice at the knight’s own expense.[1068] Ignominious discharge, before\r\nthe completed term of service, was a consequence of military negligence,\r\nas shown, for instance, by the shabby condition of the public horse\r\n(_impolitia_),[1069] or of any moral blemish, which in other ranks of\r\nlife would have entailed dismissal from the Senate or the tribes. The\r\nform of dismissal was “sell your horse” (_vende equum_), of retention\r\n“lead it on” (_traduc equum_).[1070] The censors’ final duty was to fill\r\nup the vacant gaps in the centuries. This was done by the enrolment, at\r\ntheir own discretion, of qualified members from the infantry (_pedites_).\r\n\r\nThis procedure was but one example of that wider censure which was\r\ndirected against the citizen body at the time of its registration in\r\nthe Campus Martius. This scrutiny was preceded by an edict in which the\r\ncensors declared some of their moral canons—canons, we may believe, that\r\nwere transmitted from college to college and seldom departed from—while\r\nthey animadverted on new evils which they believed to be undermining the\r\nlife of the state.[1071] The acts which called forth their censure may be\r\nconveniently considered under four heads.\r\n\r\n(i.) Those concerned with family life and private relations. The father\r\nas the domestic magistrate or judge[1072] was wholly responsible for\r\nthe conduct of the little world of the family, and the censor exercised\r\nhis control over women vicariously through their husbands.[1073]\r\nThe objects of censorian animadversion were the cruel punishment of\r\nslaves,[1074] the wrong done to a client, which had been formerly\r\npunished by pontifical law,[1075] the bad education of children, whether\r\nit took the form of undue harshness or of over-indulgence,[1076] and\r\nthe non-performance of the _sacra_ of the clan.[1077] The censors\r\ndiscountenanced celibacy,[1078] imposing additional taxation on\r\npersistent bachelors.[1079] They discouraged _mésalliances_ such as\r\nunions between free-born citizens and freedwomen,[1080] and checked the\r\nlegal freedom of divorce. In the usual marriage by _consensus_ a mere\r\nrepudiation on the part of the husband was sufficient to dissolve the\r\ntie;[1081] but the censors restrained a reckless exercise of this power,\r\nand we find a senator degraded for divorcing his wife without taking\r\nadvice of the family council.[1082] They also punished bad husbandry,\r\nneglect of property,[1083] and luxurious living,[1084] and enforced good\r\nfaith (_fides_) in the execution of informal contracts which were not yet\r\nprotected by the sanctions of the civil law. This was especially the case\r\nwith guardianship (_tutela_),[1085] but their scrutiny extended to all\r\nlegal relations that were held to involve _bona fides_, such as those of\r\npartnership, mandate, and deposit.[1086]\r\n\r\n(ii.) Disqualifications were pronounced as a consequence of certain modes\r\nof life, trades, or professions. Actors were perpetually disqualified\r\nfrom all civic privileges,[1087] and gladiators were probably subject\r\nto a similar degradation.[1088] Amongst dishonourable employments\r\nwas reckoned that of a money-lender who exacted an excessive rate of\r\ninterest.[1089]\r\n\r\n(iii.) Breaches of political duty in any sphere called down the\r\ncensor’s displeasure. The magistrate might be degraded for cruelty or\r\ninsubordination in the exercise of his office,[1090] for the neglect of\r\nconstitutional formalities,[1091] for a misuse of the auspices,[1092]\r\nor even for the passing of a law likely to injure the morals of\r\nthe community.[1093] The _judex_ might be punished for accepting\r\nbribes,[1094] the soldier or officer for shirking service or for showing\r\ncowardice or disobedience,[1095] and the voting citizen for a misuse of\r\nhis judicial or elective power.[1096] Disgraceful conduct in a court\r\nof law might also entail the censure. It visited the collusion of a\r\nprosecutor with the accused or malicious prosecution in a criminal case\r\n(_praevaricatio_, _calumnia_),[1097] and attended false witness and false\r\noaths. Since there was no secular punishment for perjury, its visitation\r\nwas peculiarly the work of the censors.[1098]\r\n\r\n(iv.) The censors sometimes pronounced disqualifications as the result of\r\na judicial sentence.[1099] Theft and other private delicts were attended\r\nwith infamy, and sometimes the censure was independent of the judgment of\r\na court.[1100] The censure, which followed a criminal condemnation, might\r\nbe either one of the censors’ own creation[1101] or the mere fulfilment\r\nof a disqualification already enjoined by law. Of the second kind were\r\nthe disabilities pronounced by the _lex Cassia_ of 104 B.C.[1102] or by\r\nthe _lex Calpurnia de ambitu_ of 67 B.C., the latter of which enjoined\r\nperpetual exclusion from the Senate as a result of condemnation.[1103]\r\n\r\nIV. The effects of the censorian _infamia_ depended partly on the rank\r\nof the person disqualified, but were always regulated to some extent\r\nby the gravity of the offence. The senator was removed from the list,\r\nthe knight from the equestrian centuries, the commoner is said _tribu\r\nmoveri_ or _aerarius fieri_, or both.[1104] “Removal from the tribe”\r\nhas two meanings: either that of the milder penalty of relegation from a\r\nhigher to a lower tribe, or of the severer punishment of total exclusion\r\nfrom the tribes, while _aerarium facere_ implies exclusion from the\r\ncenturies.[1105]\r\n\r\nV. _The lustrum._—After the ranks of the various orders had thus been\r\npurified, the lustral sacrifice (_lustratio_) was offered for the whole\r\nassembled army in the field of Mars.[1106] The ox, the sheep, and the\r\npig (_suovetaurilia_), which were led round the host and then sacrificed\r\nto the god, were at once an atonement for sin and a thanksgiving\r\nfor blessings prayed for at the preceding _lustrum_ and since\r\nvouchsafed.[1107] The completion of this ceremonial marked the close of\r\nthe censor’s functions, at least of those connected with the _census_.\r\n\r\nVI. _Other functions of the censors._—The necessity for the division of\r\nfunctions, which had created the censorship, led to financial duties,\r\nanalogous to but unconnected with those of the _census_, being taken from\r\nother magistracies and attached to that office. These were the leasing\r\nof the public revenues, the maintenance of public property, and the\r\nadministrative jurisdiction connected with these duties.\r\n\r\nThe Roman state, in its administration of the public property, had always\r\nfavoured the system of contracting out. The system was that of purchase\r\nor lease by middlemen (_publicani_) of a prospective source of revenue,\r\nwhich the individual or the company farmed at its own risk or profit.\r\nSometimes the middleman was himself the occupant (_possessor_) of, or the\r\ncontractor (_conductor_) for, the source of wealth from which the revenue\r\nwas derived. This principle was applied to limited sources of wealth or\r\nthose requiring particular industrial appliances, such as fisheries,\r\nsalt-works, mines, and forest-land. This system of direct farming was\r\nsometimes applied to domain-land both in Italy and the provinces. The\r\n_ager Campanus_ was dealt with in this way, and the royal domains of\r\nthe kings whom Rome had supplanted were, with the confiscated territory\r\nof Corinth, let on long leases to _publicani_,[1108] who doubtless in\r\nmost cases sublet these territories to smaller holders. Such contracts\r\nwere put up to auction, and their terms were fixed by a _lex censoria_\r\ndictated by the censor as the representative of the state. This _lex_,\r\nbesides specifying the revenue which the lessee was required to pay, also\r\nfixed the conditions under which the contract was to be undertaken.[1109]\r\n\r\nThe second kind of tax-farmer is a true middleman.[1110] The _publicanus_\r\nhere is not himself employed in working the source of wealth; he is not\r\na _possessor_ or occupant, but one who has bought from the state the\r\nright to collect revenue from such an occupant. The right is put up to\r\nauction and bought for a fixed sum, for which the company of successful\r\ncontractors furnishes security. Their gains depend on the prospective\r\nsurplus of the revenue which they propose to farm over the sum which\r\nthey have agreed to pay. This was the method of dealing with the public\r\nland which had been left open for occupation by squatters (_occupatorius\r\nager_). It was either tilled land (_ager_) enjoyed by a _possessor_, or\r\npasture land (_silva pascua_, _saltus_) over which the _pastor_ grazed\r\nhis flocks. Both occupants were tolerated by the state on condition that\r\nthey paid a fixed due for their precarious tenure.[1111] The _publicani_\r\nwere the men who had the right to collect this _vectigal_ from the user\r\nof the land, and the dues which they might collect were determined by\r\nthe _lex dicta_ under which the censor sold the right.[1112] A further\r\nclass of revenues collected in this manner were the harbour dues\r\n(_portoria_). They were based on the same leading idea of the use of\r\npublic ground by a private occupant; he pays for this use, and the right\r\nof collecting this _vectigal_ within a given area is sold to a company of\r\n_publicani_. A great extension was given to this system of tax-farming by\r\nits application to provincial administration. The Roman translated the\r\ntithe (δεκάτη, _decuma_) which he found in Sicily and Asia into his own\r\nfamiliar _vectigal_, but for a time he adhered to the existing conditions\r\nof local collection, and in Sicily the tithes were sold in the island\r\nitself in accordance with the _lex Hieronica_.[1113] Asia was the first\r\nprovince to which the experiment of a collective sale of the taxes in\r\nRome was applied.[1114] The system was apparently extended to the Asiatic\r\nprovinces organised by Pompeius, and the censorship was the normal\r\nvehicle through which the revenues of a vast kingdom could be purchased\r\nby a company of Roman speculators.\r\n\r\nThe censors exercised great discretionary powers in the conclusion of\r\nthese contracts, but a revision of such as had already been concluded\r\nbelonged not to them but to the Senate.[1115] Their merely executive\r\ncapacity is an explanation of the fact that they could not alienate\r\nthe property of the Roman people. Wherever the sale of public lands or\r\nbuildings by these officials is described, we must assume the concurrence\r\nof the people or the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the censors’ control of the property of the state made\r\ntheir registers (_tabulae_) assume the proportions of a budget, which\r\nmust have been the guide of the state’s expenditure. Although only\r\nquinquennial, this budget was tolerably stable, for the varying returns\r\n(as opposed to the invariable revenues, such as the fixed tribute of\r\nsome of the provinces) were estimated for the interval that elapsed\r\nbetween one _lustrum_ and another. An unusual increment, such as that\r\nfrom booty, which might appear in any year, would have formed the ground\r\nfor a statement made by the quaestors, the permanent officials of the\r\n_aerarium_.\r\n\r\nBut, although estimates were made by the censor, he had little to do\r\nwith general expenditure. He had no concern with the provinces and the\r\narmy, and was limited to the maintenance and extension of the public\r\nproperty of the state. He was either a maker or a repairer of _opera\r\npublica_, such as roads, aqueducts, temples, and public buildings.[1116]\r\nSuch buildings or repairs were leased out to contractors, the state\r\nhere becoming the debtor of a private company and seeking to obtain the\r\nlowest estimate for the work.[1117] For the purpose of repairs or new\r\nworks a credit (_pecunia attributa_) was granted by the Senate, which\r\ndirected the quaestors to employ this money at the discretion of the\r\ncensors.[1118] Within the limits of this sum they could act at their\r\nown discretion with respect to the modes of expenditure, although they\r\ndoubtless took the advice of the Senate. These grants and the purposes\r\nto which they were applied were known by the strange name of _ultro\r\ntributa_,[1119] a designation which may be a relic of a time when such\r\n_opera_ were not leased, but were burdens (_munera_, _moenia_), owed as a\r\nvoluntary tribute by the community.[1120]\r\n\r\nThese financial functions of the censors gave rise to an administrative\r\njurisdiction. In their guardianship of public places they decided where\r\nprivate buildings had encroached on state property,[1121] or where\r\npublic buildings had been usurped by _privati_.[1122] They may at times\r\nhave pronounced on the pecuniary penalties meant to enforce the rights\r\nof public property, for they sometimes exercised their coercive power\r\nand proclaimed varying penalties (_multae_) to compel obedience;[1123]\r\nbut such quasi-criminal jurisdiction must have been exercised more\r\nfrequently by the aediles, and, where the amount of the fine necessitated\r\nthe appeal, it must have been pronounced and defended by the latter\r\nmagistrates. Jurisdiction bearing a resemblance to that of civil law was\r\nconcerned with the _ultro tributa_, when the question arose whether a\r\ncontract had been carried out satisfactorily or not, and with disputes\r\nabout the public land, the controversy in the latter case lying most\r\nfrequently between the _publicanus_ and the _possessor_,[1124] but\r\nsometimes, no doubts between one who claimed to be an owner on the one\r\nhand and the middleman or an occupant on the other. The form of this\r\njurisdiction varied. Sometimes, when the dispute lay between the state\r\nand an individual, as in the controversies about the _ultro tributa_,\r\nthe sentence was the result of a purely magisterial cognisance, although\r\nwe may suppose that the censor could, if he pleased, give a _judex_ in\r\nsuch a case. Where the dispute lay between two _privati_, even though one\r\nof them had the quasi-official position of a _publicanus_, the granting\r\nof a _judex_ or _recuperatores_ was, at least in the later Republic,\r\nusual.[1125]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The plebeian Magistrates_\r\n\r\nThe accidental preservation of the tribunate, through the failure of the\r\ndecemvirate to do its work, and consequently of the plebeian assembly\r\nin all its purity, led to the persistence of a magistracy chosen only\r\nby and only from the Plebs. But the plebeian aedileship was welded with\r\nthe curule office of the same name into practically a single magistracy,\r\nwhich has already been discussed;[1126] while the tribunate is so\r\nintimately bound up with every phase of the constitutional development\r\nand organisation of Rome, that every one of its leading functions has\r\nalready been considered.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the method of its institution and the singular religious\r\nbasis on which its power rested,[1127] and we have observed the numbers\r\nof the holders of the office rising from two to four, and finally to\r\nten.[1128] The right of eliciting resolutions from the Plebs and the\r\ncoercive power and jurisdiction possessed by this office have also\r\nbeen described.[1129] We have further dwelt on the anomalous duality\r\nof the office, and seen how in a certain sense it is not a magistracy,\r\nthe tribune lacking both the requisite _insignia_[1130] and the right\r\nof taking _auspicia impetrativa_,[1131] but how, on the other hand,\r\nit becomes practically a magistracy of the people, when functions\r\noriginally purely plebeian come to be used in the interest of the whole\r\nstate. The right of acting with the Plebs gave the tribunes the power of\r\ninitiating legislation when _plebiscita_ had been raised to the level of\r\n_leges_;[1132] in their elective capacity they not only presided over the\r\nappointment of their successors and of the plebeian aediles, but through\r\nthe Plebs they might not only create a minor magistracy such as the\r\ntriumvirate _agris dandis assignandis_,[1133] but in the closing years\r\nof the Republic actually conducted the election of such officials.[1134]\r\nTheir power of prohibition and their right of veto,[1135] limited for a\r\nmoment by Sulla but soon restored in all its plenitude,[1136] became,\r\nwhen constitutionally employed, a guardianship of the whole state against\r\nthe illegal or unconstitutional proceedings of other magistrates, and\r\nformed the chief basis of the Senate’s authority. Their association with\r\nthe Senate, from being merely prohibitive, grew to be positive,[1137] and\r\nthey finally shared the presidency of that body. Lastly, their powers\r\nof coercion and jurisdiction widened into a judicial control of the\r\nmagistracy; they were the prosecutors of faulty officials, and, up to the\r\ntime of the development of the _quaestiones_, represented the chief means\r\nwhich the state possessed of enforcing criminal responsibility on its\r\nexecutive.[1138]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The minor Magistrates_\r\n\r\nProminent amongst the minor magistrates (_minores magistratus_)[1139]\r\nstands a group known finally, and perhaps in Republican times, as the\r\n_viginti-sex-viri_.[1140] This group was merely a collection of small\r\ncolleges and not itself a _collegium_. It is probable that most of its\r\nmembers were originally nominated by superior magistrates; in later times\r\nthey were all elected in the _comitia tributa_, although doubtless a\r\nseparate elective act was required for each college.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The _IIIviri capitales_, sometimes called by the less technical\r\nname of _IIIviri nocturni_, probably from their duty of extinguishing\r\nfires, were introduced as a standing institution about the year 289\r\nB.C.[1141] Their general function was that of assistance to the other\r\nmagistrates in criminal jurisdiction. After the judgment had been\r\npronounced, they guarded the prisoners and carried out the death\r\nsentence.[1142] Their duties preliminary to a criminal trial were the\r\npreventive imprisonment of the accused and the conduct of a first\r\nexamination after a criminal charge had been made.[1143] They also heard\r\nordinary police-court charges, such as those of vagrancy or nocturnal\r\ndisturbance of the peace,[1144] and they exercised police duties in the\r\ntown, such as that of preserving order in the streets.[1145] When acting\r\nas magistrates who could give a final judgment, their dealings seem to\r\nhave been with slaves and foreigners. There is no evidence that they\r\npossessed any right of sentencing citizens or any higher jurisdiction\r\nwhich would bring them into contact with the people.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The triumvirate of the masters of the mint (_IIIviri\r\nmonetales_),[1146] originally an occasional, first becomes a standing\r\noffice about the time of the social war.[1147]\r\n\r\n(_c_) Six sanitary commissioners, acting probably as subordinates to\r\nthe aediles and bearing the titles _IVviri viis in urbe purgandis_ (or\r\n_viarum curandarum_), _IIviri viis extra propiusve urbem Romam passus\r\nmille purgandis_, are first mentioned in Caesar’s Municipal Law (45\r\nB.C.). The first looked to the cleansing of the streets within Rome, the\r\nsecond perhaps of those within the radius of a mile from the walls.[1148]\r\n\r\n(_d_) The _Xviri stlitibus judicandis_ have a strange history; for, from\r\nbeing simple _judices_, they become minor magistrates of the people.\r\nThey are doubtless the decemvirs who were rendered sacrosanct by the\r\nValerio-Horatian laws of 449 B.C.,[1149] the reason for this protection\r\nbeing that they were the jurors who decided in cases of freedom,\r\nthat ultimate plebeian right which, as the story of Verginia shows,\r\nmight sometimes be assailed. By Cicero’s time they are still judges\r\nin _liberales causae_, but they have risen to the rank of independent\r\nmagistrates.[1150]\r\n\r\n(_e_) The _IIIIviri praefecti Capuam Cumas_[1151] were the elected\r\ndelegates who represented the jurisdiction of the praetor in the\r\n_municipia_ and colonies of the Campanian district. Their functions may\r\nbe more appropriately discussed when we are dealing with the organisation\r\nof Italy.\r\n\r\nCertain judicial and military posts were also filled by popular election.\r\nThe paucity of criminal judges at Rome after the institution of the\r\n_quaestiones perpetuae_[1152] led to the appointment of an annual\r\npresident of the chief court which tried ordinary crimes—that, namely,\r\nwhich dealt with murder and kindred offences (_quaestio de sicariis_).\r\nThe magisterial position of these _judices quaestionis_ is shown both by\r\nthe fixed qualification—it is generally, perhaps always, an ex-aedile\r\nthat is appointed[1153]—and by the fact that, like the magistrate who\r\ntakes the oath _in leges_,[1154] these _judices_ swear to observe the\r\nspecial law which they are administering.[1155] They were probably\r\nelected by the people in the _comitia tributa_.[1156]\r\n\r\nSubordinate military posts were also in the people’s gift, and we have\r\nalready noticed how the tribunate of the legions became in part a\r\nquasi-magistracy.[1157] In the year 311 B.C. the appointment of consular\r\ndelegates for the command and maintenance of the fleet was also entrusted\r\nto the tribes.[1158] These _IIviri navales_ were not annual officials,\r\nbut, in obedience to the occasional character of the Roman fleet, came\r\ninto existence when a war required its creation. The office seems to have\r\nbecome extinct by the second century B.C.\r\n\r\nMore occasional still was the creation by the _comitia tributa_, in later\r\ntimes occasionally by the _concilium plebis_,[1159] of minor magistrates\r\nwith extraordinary functions. Such were the officials for conducting a\r\ncolony (_coloniae deducendae_) for the assignment of land (_agris dandis\r\nassignandis_), or for the dedication of a temple (_aedi dedicandae_). To\r\nthis category belong the occasional _curatores_ for the corn-supply and\r\nthe roads (_annonae_, _viarum_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE PEOPLE AND ITS POWERS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already noticed the duality of procedure by which the powers of\r\nthe people were exercised, and seen that every popular act was dependent\r\non a _rogatio_.[1160] But different spheres of popular activity may\r\nconveniently be distinguished. They may be divided into (i.) legislative\r\nor quasi-legislative acts; (ii.) elective; (iii.) judicial.\r\n\r\n(i.) With respect to legislation proper, the Roman, like every other\r\ngovernment which recognises the theory of parliamentary sovereignty and\r\nhas no provision for a constituent assembly, drew no distinction between\r\nconstitutional and other laws. But in our enumeration we may conveniently\r\ndistinguish between those ordinances which altered the structure of the\r\nconstitution and affected public rights, and those which dealt merely\r\nwith the private relations of the citizens to one another.\r\n\r\nIn constitutional legislation the power of the people was unlimited.\r\nThey could create new parliaments, as they did the _comitia tributa\r\npopuli_;[1161] they could delegate full powers of legislation\r\nto parliaments already existing, as they did to the _concilium\r\nplebis_.[1162] They could devolve powers almost amounting to sovereign\r\nrights on an individual, as they devolved them ultimately on the\r\nPrinceps. They might suspend the constitution and set up a provisional\r\ngovernment, as they did when they gave constitutive powers to the\r\ndecemvirs or to Sulla.\r\n\r\nThey might also observe or create rules which limited their own power\r\nof utterance. A result of observance of a rule is a _formula_ which\r\nappears in Roman laws declaring their operation invalid in so far as they\r\nconflict with any fundamental obligation—the _fas_ or _jus_ which lies\r\nat the background of the state and which the people themselves dare not\r\ninfringe. The scruple was expressed in the saving clause—\r\n\r\n    SI QUID JUS NON ESSET ROGARIER, EJUS EA LEGE NIHILUM\r\n    ROGATUM.[1163]\r\n\r\nPrimarily this clause guarded a law against being a breach of a religious\r\nobligation;[1164] but, as interpreted by Cicero, it was a profession of\r\nrespect even for certain ultimate secular rights—the rights for instance,\r\nto the possession of citizenship.\r\n\r\nThe creation of limitations may be instanced by the provision of the\r\nTwelve Tables, which forbade enactments to the detriment of individuals\r\n(_privilegia_),[1165] and by a principle—perhaps rather a rule of\r\nprocedure analogous to the formalities of legislation—which forbade laws\r\non different subjects to be passed _en bloc_ (_per saturam_), a provision\r\nre-enacted by a _lex Caecilia Didia_ of 98 B.C.[1166]\r\n\r\nThe creation of new magistracies was also within the power of the\r\npeople, and, originally, the extension of an office beyond its proper\r\nterm. In the year 327 B.C., at the commencement of the second Samnite\r\nwar, the consul Q. Publilius Philo had his _imperium_ prolonged by a\r\n_plebiscitum_;[1167] although, as early as 308 B.C., in the prorogation\r\nof the command of the consul Q. Fabius Maximus, the Senate alone is\r\nmentioned as giving its sanction.[1168]\r\n\r\nThe establishment of special judicial commissions to decide without\r\nappeal, in cases where the ordinary authorities were felt to be unable\r\nto cope with crime or conspiracy, was, in the strict theory of the\r\nconstitution, entirely in the people’s hands. Commissions of this kind\r\nare found in 187,[1169] 172,[1170] and 141[1171] B.C. In all these cases\r\nthere was co-operation between the Senate and people, and it is not until\r\nthe revolutionary period that the people ventures on its own authority to\r\nestablish a commission for criminal investigation.[1172]\r\n\r\nThe public rights of the individual were also under the control of\r\nthe _comitia_, and the conferment of citizenship was solely the\r\npeople’s gift. As originally the patrician _comitia_ could alone coopt\r\npatricians,[1173] so in later times the assembly of the whole Populus\r\ncould alone admit new partners to its rights. Civic rights could be\r\nconferred on individuals or communities, in whole or in part, and the\r\nPlebs was for this purpose equally competent with the Populus.[1174] A\r\nmediate grant of the citizenship could be made by the conferment of the\r\npower by the people on a magistrate entrusted with the founding of a\r\nsettlement, as when the _lex Appuleia_ of 100 B.C. granted the right to\r\nMarius to raise three persons to the citizenship in any colony which he\r\nplanted.[1175] Citizenship might also be conferred by an imperator for\r\ngood service in the field; but the power had to be given, or perhaps in\r\nsome cases the grant retrospectively sanctioned, by the people. Such a\r\npower was given by law to Pompeius after the war with Sertorius;[1176]\r\nbut Pompeius may provisionally have conferred the citizenship during the\r\ncampaign. Marius granted the boon on the field of battle;[1177] he may\r\nhave already had the power given him by the people,[1178] or he may have\r\ncalculated on the subsequent ratification of his act.\r\n\r\nDeprivation of the citizenship of a community, the legality of which by\r\nany power was questioned in the later Republic,[1179] could be effected,\r\nif at all, only by the people, and the people might in this particular\r\nbe represented by the Plebs. It was this body which pronounced on the\r\nfate of Capua in 210 B.C., and their decision entailed a criminal\r\ncondemnation, the penalty of being sold into slavery. The people,\r\nhowever, did not itself pronounce deprivation of citizenship, but left\r\nthe fate of the Capuan burghers to the Senate.[1180]\r\n\r\nThe people might also give the right of voting to those who already\r\npossessed citizenship without it. This was so entirely a popular gift\r\nthat even the previous deliberation of the Senate was not considered\r\nnecessary for such a conferment. When a tribune proposed to grant the\r\nright of suffrage to the _municipia_ of Formiae, Fundi, and Arpinum in\r\n188 B.C., he was met by the veto of four of his colleagues, who insisted\r\nthat the Senate’s judgment should first be taken. But, yielding to\r\ninstruction on the true principle of such gifts, they eventually withdrew\r\ntheir opposition.[1181]\r\n\r\nThe deprivation of voting power—_tribu movere_ in the extreme sense—seems\r\nto have been retained by the censor,[1182] although a protest against\r\nits use to disfranchise a whole class was raised in 169 B.C.[1183]. The\r\npeople alone could impose a new burden on itself, and taxation belonged\r\nwholly to the _comitia_.[1184]\r\n\r\nPassing to legislation on private matters, we find that any fundamental\r\nchange in the legal relations of citizens to one another must be effected\r\nby the people. The law of the Twelve Tables is itself a _lex centuriata_,\r\nand we need only think of laws, such as those on usury, or the _lex\r\nVoconia_ on inheritance, as types of a multitude of others. In the matter\r\nof civil procedure also a fundamental change, such as that permitting\r\nthe use of the _formula_ in place of the _legis actio_ in cases falling\r\nunder the _jus civile_, required legislation.[1185] Yet we feel that it\r\nis only a question of degree whether such changes are effected by the\r\npeople or by the authority of individuals. In matters of substantive law\r\nimmense changes were brought about by the interpreting authority of the\r\npraetor;[1186] while in procedure also much was left to the discretion\r\nof pontiffs, magistrates, and jurists. The same principle of division of\r\nauthority applies to police regulations. Wide as were the coercive powers\r\nof the magistrates, sweeping infringements on individual liberty, such as\r\nthose created by the sumptuary laws, were the work of the people.\r\n\r\nWe may pause here to examine the form of a _lex_, and especially that\r\nportion of it which secured its validity—its sanction. A complete\r\nlaw contained three parts: (1) its preamble (_praescriptio_), which\r\ndescribed the formal circumstances of its enactment;[1187] (2) the text,\r\nin which a minute and exhaustive formalism was rigorously preserved;\r\n(3) the sanction, which contained the pains and penalties pronounced\r\nagainst those who violated the provisions of the enactment. A _poena_,\r\nhowever, was not of itself sufficient to constitute a perfect law. A _lex\r\nperfecta_ was one which declared an act invalid and imposed a penalty\r\nfor disobedience. The imposition of a penalty without the declaration of\r\ninvalidity constituted a _lex minus quam perfecta_.[1188] A law without\r\na sanction was _imperfecta_.[1189] The method of repeal most frequently\r\npractised at Rome was rather that of supersession than of the declaration\r\nof the nullity of the former enactment. Hence the sanction of laws often\r\ngives impunity to those who by obedience incur the pains and penalties\r\npronounced by some previous measure.[1190] Repeal might be either\r\ncomplete or partial, and a series of technical terms was evolved to\r\nexpress this difference.[1191]\r\n\r\nThe attempt of certain laws to secure finality by prohibiting repeal\r\nwas necessarily futile, as opposed to the whole theory of parliamentary\r\nsovereignty.[1192] It is possible, however, that the _leges sacratae_\r\nof the early Republic, such as that which made the tribune sacrosanct,\r\nwere regarded as unalterable. The _execratio_, which was their sanction,\r\nmay have been regarded as a fundamental religious obligation, and have\r\nbeen held, as such, to be one of those sacred rights which, as we have\r\nseen,[1193] no law professed to infringe.\r\n\r\nThe sovereign privilege of exempting individuals from laws was naturally\r\npossessed at first by the legislative body itself; but by a curious\r\nrevolution, which we shall trace elsewhere,[1194] this singular privilege\r\nbecame a prerogative of the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe people’s control of external matters, although it is still, from\r\na juristic point of view, legislative, bears a closer resemblance to\r\nthe administrative functions of a Greek or modern government. Here the\r\nmagistrate was empowered to act in all matters of detail, and we shall\r\nsee how this magisterial sphere was usurped by the Senate. The people\r\nhad only the control of the fundamental relations of Rome with foreign\r\nstates. Their activity was confined to the declaration of war, the making\r\nof treaties, and the giving of charters.\r\n\r\nA declaration of war was, according to Roman notions, strictly necessary\r\nonly when treaty relations, or even at times relations which approximated\r\nto those of a treaty,[1195] had been broken. Such a declaration could\r\nbe made only by the people.[1196] But the international point of view\r\nwas not the only dominant one in this matter. The people must have been\r\nconsulted in many cases where there were no treaty relations, and the\r\nreason would have been simply the advisability of its declaring its will\r\non a matter which might be of vital importance to the community. The\r\n_comitia centuriata_ seems invariably to have represented the people in\r\nthis capacity.[1197] With respect to the conclusion of international\r\nrelations, we shall touch elsewhere on the controverted question[1198]\r\nwhether the magistracy had the right of binding the popular conscience\r\nby a sworn treaty, or whether this required the consent of the people.\r\nThe survival of the controversy into as late a period as that of the\r\nJugurthine war seems to prove that the federative power was once a\r\nmagisterial privilege; and the fact is also attested by the inclusion in\r\nagreements made by commanders of a clause specifying that the agreement\r\nshould only be valid if ratified by the people.[1199] In the middle\r\nRepublic there was no question that treaty relations were the prerogative\r\nof the people,[1200] and, unlike the case of the declaration of war, the\r\nPlebs is here included in the conception of the people.[1201] By the\r\nnature of the case it could only be the outlines of an agreement that\r\nwere thus laid before the _comitia_, and details of settlement were left\r\nto the commander, assisted by a commission.[1202] The organisation of\r\na province and the _lex provinciae_ that followed the subjection of a\r\ndistrict were not usually interpreted in the light of treaty relations;\r\nthey were the work of a commander and a senatorial commission. On the\r\nother hand, cities with treaties (_civitates foederatae_) and cities\r\nwith charters (_civitates liberae_) have their rights given them by the\r\npeople. In the one case the rights are guaranteed by an irrevocable\r\nagreement sworn to by the _fetiales_; in the other by a revocable charter\r\n(_lex data_), which as late as 71 B.C. is still an utterance of the\r\npeople (_lex rogata_).[1203] We shall see, in dealing with the Senate,\r\nthat, even in this matter of granting treaties or charters to separate\r\nstates, senatorial authority encroached on that of the people.\r\n\r\n(ii.) We have already seen how in theory the popular power of election\r\nwas a modification of a principle of nomination;[1204] after its\r\nrecognition the principles regulating it were practically those of\r\nlegislation, the magistrate questioning and the people commanding. The\r\nrepresentation of the dual community is here rather more marked than in\r\nthe case of legislation; for while a _plebiscitum_ is often spoken of as\r\na _lex_, no one credits the tribune with the position of a _magistratus\r\npopuli_, and however wide his powers may have become, he always remains\r\nin theory the head of the plebeian community. The preliminaries to\r\nelection necessary to the candidate for office have already been\r\nconsidered,[1205] and the further process of election will be dealt with\r\nwhen we describe the procedure of the _comitia_ as a whole.\r\n\r\n(iii.) The origin of the jurisdiction of the people is, as we have seen,\r\nobscure; but it is probable that it did not spring wholly from the\r\n_provocatio_,[1206] and even in cases where it did, the appeal tended\r\nto become extinct, from the fact that a magistrate who recognised the\r\nrestrictions imposed on his _imperium_ by law would not pronounce a\r\nsentence, but would bring the case immediately before the people. A\r\ntrial before the people (_judicium populi_) took place when a magistrate\r\nrecognised the limitations on his power; the _provocatio_—an extremely\r\nrare occurrence in the later Republic—was required to start the same\r\nprocedure when the magistrate refused to recognise these limitations.\r\n\r\nThe judicial competence of the different magistrates and _comitia_ was\r\ndetermined partly by law, partly by custom. Two fundamental principles\r\nwere recognised:—\r\n\r\n(1) That capital cases should be reserved for the centuries. To this\r\nthere is the exception furnished by the special capital jurisdiction of\r\nthe Plebs.[1207]\r\n\r\n(2) That a case initiated by a magistrate could be tried only in that\r\nassembly which the magistrate was competent to approach. To this\r\nprinciple there were two exceptions: first, the consular delegates—the\r\nquaestors and the _duumviri perduellionis_—although possessing no _jus\r\nagendi cum populo_, yet guided the assemblies in which an appeal from\r\ntheir decision was made;[1208] and secondly, the tribune, when conducting\r\na capital prosecution before the _comitia centuriata_, approached, and\r\nperhaps had the presidency of, this body.[1209]\r\n\r\nBut, as a rule, the official character of the magistrate who conducts the\r\nprosecution, and the nature of the penalty which he proposes, are signs\r\nof what assembly passes its final judgment on the case.\r\n\r\nThe capital jurisdiction of the consuls, expressed through the quaestors,\r\nwas exercised in the _comitia centuriata_; an appeal against the\r\n_coercitio_ of consuls and praetors, when the fine which they imposed\r\npassed the limit of the _multa suprema_[1210] came before the _comitia\r\ntributa populi_. The jurisdiction of the aediles[1211] was always\r\nexercised before the tribes; the curule aediles as _magistratus populi_\r\nmust have brought their case before the _comitia tributa populi_; the\r\nplebeian aediles, who, as magistrates of the Plebs, had no right of\r\napproaching the people, appeared before the _concilium plebis_. With\r\nregard to the tribunes, where their jurisdiction was capital, it may in\r\ncertain cases have been exercised by the _concilium plebis_, but usually\r\nnecessitated an appearance before the _comitia centuriata_,[1212] where\r\nit was pecuniary, the tribune would invariably have brought the case\r\nbefore his own assembly of the Plebs.\r\n\r\nThe procedure in a _judicium populi_ consisted of two stages. In the\r\nfirst, the magistrate who intended to impose a sentence which was beyond\r\nthe limits of his personal jurisdiction held a preliminary examination\r\n(_anquisitio_).[1213] This is conducted with the fullest publicity before\r\nan informal assembly or _contio_ which he has summoned. This preliminary\r\ninvestigation is repeated three times, on days not necessarily\r\nconsecutive. The magistrate is represented as a prosecutor, and his\r\nexpressions of opinion at these meetings are spoken of as _accusationes_.\r\nHis final judgment, consequent on the proceedings of the third _contio_,\r\nis a bill (_rogatio_), which he gives notice of his intention to bring\r\nbefore the _comitia_. The penalty proposed in this bill need not be that\r\noriginally suggested, for the investigation may have led the magistrate\r\nto amend his original proposal.[1214]\r\n\r\nThe legal interval for promulgation—three weeks—then elapsed, and at its\r\nclose the proposal was brought by the magistrate before the _comitia_. It\r\nwas then either accepted or rejected (necessarily without amendment) by\r\nthe assembled people. This formal assembly (_comitia_) was, in judicial\r\nas in legislative acts, preceded by a _contio_; and the magistrate’s\r\nfinal statement of his proposal before this _contio_ is spoken of\r\nas his “fourth accusation” (_quarta accusatio_).[1215] If, through\r\nany chance, such as evil auspices, the bill was not carried through\r\nthe _comitia_, a fresh promulgation, with another interval of three\r\nweeks, was necessary for a revival of the trial. This necessity made a\r\nrepetition of a prosecution by the same magistrate on the same charge\r\nvery infrequent.[1216]\r\n\r\nHitherto we have been treating the case of a _judicium populi_ consequent\r\non the magistrate’s recognising the limitations on his power. But there\r\nis a possibility of his refusing this recognition, and in this case\r\nthe matter can be brought to the people only by means of an appeal\r\n(_provocatio_) lodged by the accused. This contingency was, in the middle\r\nand later Republic, unusual but not unknown, for the jurisdiction of the\r\n_duumviri perduellionis_ was, as we know from the case of Rabirius,[1217]\r\nregulated at times in such a manner that an appeal to the people was an\r\nessential part of the procedure.\r\n\r\nIn such a case there were two magisterial investigations instead of\r\none. The first was the _quaestio_, as a result of which the magistrate\r\nhad pronounced the appellable sentence; the second was the _anquisitio_\r\nbefore the people preceding the decision in the _comitia_. It must\r\noccasionally have happened that different magistrates conducted these two\r\nstages of procedure; for if an individual appealed against the decision\r\nof a magistrate in a province or in the field, this magistrate might\r\nhimself be unable to conduct the case at Rome.\r\n\r\nThe people is represented from a very early time as rescinding its own\r\nsentences.[1218] This rescission was simply the repeal of a law, and was\r\nperhaps not regarded originally as the revision of its own sentence by\r\na court. No provision was made that the particular assembly which had\r\npronounced the sentence should repeal it. This was, indeed, sometimes\r\nthe case. Popilius, for instance, who had been held responsible for\r\nthe judicial murders following the fate of Ti. Gracchus, was both\r\nbanished and restored by _plebiscita_.[1219] But, on the other hand,\r\nMetellus, “interdicted” by a consular bill, which must have been passed\r\nat the _comitia centuriata_,[1220] was restored by the _rogatio_ of a\r\ntribune,[1221] while Cicero himself, banished by a tribunician enactment,\r\nwas recalled from exile by a consular law passed at the _comitia\r\ncenturiata_.[1222]\r\n\r\nA further step in the exercise of this power was taken when attempts\r\nwere made to rescind the decisions of the _judices_ of criminal\r\ncommissions by decrees of the people. This was first attempted in 88\r\nB.C. by the tribune P. Sulpicius Rufus, who carried a _plebiscitum_\r\nfor the restoration of exiles who had been condemned by the Varian\r\ncommission.[1223] Other tentative steps in the same direction led up to\r\nCaesar’s bill of 49, by which he effected the restoration of those who\r\nhad been condemned under the Pompeian laws of 52 B.C.[1224] The instances\r\nof this period generally illustrate the rescission of the decrees of\r\nspecial commissions, which were themselves political weapons evoked by\r\nparty conflict, but M. Antonius when tribune is said to have effected the\r\nrestoration of a man who had been condemned for an ordinary crime,[1225]\r\nand, therefore, presumably by an ordinary _quaestio perpetua_, and\r\nit seems clear that by Cicero’s time this power of restitution by\r\nthe _comitia_ had come to be regarded as practically one of pardon.\r\nEach of the three legislative assemblies was competent to “restore”\r\n(_restituere_). The proposals are usually tribunician, but Caesar also\r\nemployed praetorian rogations (probably before the _comitia tributa_) for\r\nthe purpose.[1226]\r\n\r\nTwo powers analogous to that of the rescission of a sentence are the\r\nremission of outlawry and amnesty.\r\n\r\nThe outlawry referred to is not that following on _aquae et ignis\r\ninterdictio_, which was an act of the people and the confirmation of\r\na criminal sentence, but that consequent on a decree of the Senate,\r\nwhich had pronounced individuals to be _hostes_. Although we might\r\nhave expected that the Senate, which passed, would be the body to\r\nrescind such a decree, we find the belief that the restitution of the\r\noutlawed required a _lex_ or _plebiscitum_. Marius pretended that such\r\na permit was necessary for his entrance into Rome in 87 B.C.,[1227] and\r\nOctavian in 43 B.C. had a law passed which rescinded the outlawry of\r\nDolabella.[1228]\r\n\r\nAmnesty is an act which implies that no trial and no condemnation,\r\nwhether pronounced by a court or other body, have taken place; it gives\r\nimmunity from the consequence of criminal acts that have not yet been\r\njudged. This, however, is a prerogative, not of the people, but of\r\nthe Senate. It was a decree of this body that gave an immunity (not\r\nsubsequently respected) to Caesar’s murderers in 44 B.C.,[1229] and a\r\nsimilar act in 33 B.C. granted an amnesty to senators who had during the\r\ncivil war raised troops at their own cost.[1230]\r\n\r\nThe occasional grounds of invalidity of these legislative or\r\nquasi-legislative acts of the people have already been incidentally\r\nconsidered. We have spoken of the conditions of the auspices and the\r\nintercession,[1231] neglect of either of which made a law _ipso jure_\r\ninvalid, and the same consequence followed a breach of the formal rules\r\nwhich the people had made for its own guidance, such as the rules of\r\npromulgation which we shall soon discuss, or the provision against the\r\nunion of heterogeneous measures in the same bill.[1232] In the earlier\r\nperiod of Republican history such invalid ordinances were, when they\r\ntook the form of election, subjected to a procedure resembling repeal,\r\nand there are many instances of magistrates _vitio creati_ forced to\r\nabdicate their office, a renewal of the elective procedure following\r\non their abdication;[1233] and even in the case of laws which offended\r\nagainst fundamental principles of the constitution, it was at all times\r\nconsidered safer to secure their formal repeal.[1234] But the more\r\nlogical idea of absolute nullity, which required no repeal, subsequently\r\nprevailed, and we shall find that it is the Senate which, as the guide of\r\nthe executive power, pronounces enactments to be invalid in consequence\r\nof formal flaws.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn from the “people” in general to its manifestations in\r\nthe separate _comitia_ and in the _concilium_ of the Plebs, we find\r\nthat, although historically we are dealing with different parliaments,\r\npractically we are treating the Roman community engaged with different\r\norders of the day under different formal rules. The people require to be\r\norganised in one way for one function, in another way for another,[1235]\r\nbut under the changing forms there is a unity of personnel which forbids\r\nus regarding the different assemblies as different sovereigns.[1236] The\r\nonly disturbance to this unity is found in the fact that the Patricians\r\nwere always excluded from the _concilium_ of the Plebs.[1237]\r\n\r\nThe _comitia curiata_, the oldest sovereign in Rome, was a mere shadow of\r\nits former self. Its main constitutional function was that of passing\r\nthe _lex curiata_, which was necessary for the ratification originally\r\nof the _imperium_[1238] and, with the creation of fresh patrician\r\nmagistracies, of the _potestas_ which these involved.[1239] Yet although\r\nin theory no magistracy was properly constituted (_justus_) until its\r\nholder had received the ratification of the _curiae_, we know that in\r\nthe case of those with _imperium_, and we may conclude that in that of\r\nothers, most of the ordinary functions could be exercised without this\r\nsanction. It was only the full exercise of the _imperium_, whether in\r\njurisdiction, in military command, or in the transmission of office,\r\nthat was in suspense until the _lex_ had been elicited. Without it the\r\npraetor could not give justice from his tribunal,[1240] the consul could\r\nnot hold an assembly for the creation of his successor,[1241] and whether\r\nas magistrate or pro-magistrate could not exercise the full _imperium_\r\nin the field,[1242] until the ambiguous wording of the _lex Cornelia de\r\nprovinciis ordinandis_ made the requirement in this last particular a\r\ndoubtful point.[1243]\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this conferment the _comitia curiata_ was in Cicero’s\r\nday often represented by but thirty lictors,[1244] and the same scanty\r\nattendance may have sufficed for the other formal acts which it retained\r\nfrom antiquity. These are the acts of the _comitia calata_.[1245] The\r\npublic will and testament made at this assembly was extinct at the close\r\nof the Republic; but the _comitia_ still met, under the presidency of the\r\n_pontifex maximus_, for the inauguration of the _rex sacrorum_ and the\r\n_flamines_, and under the same guidance for the _detestatio sacrorum_\r\nmade by one who passed from his _gens_ either by an act of adrogation or\r\nby transition from the patrician to the plebeian order.[1246]\r\n\r\nThe _comitia centuriata_, once known as the “greatest of the comitia”\r\n(_comitiatus maximus_),[1247] not only from its importance as expressing\r\nthe sovereign will, but from the possibility of enforcing the attendance\r\nof the assembled army, always retained something of its military\r\ncharacter and its association with the _imperium_. Its summons and\r\npresidency belong by right only to the magistrates with _imperium_. The\r\nconsuls are its normal presidents for elections and for laws; the praetor\r\napproaches it for purposes of jurisdiction, and the interrex for the\r\nelection of a consul. The election of magistrates with _imperium_ and of\r\nthe censors was confined to this body, and we have already seen how its\r\nsupreme judicial authority was asserted and infringed.[1248] The army\r\nalone could declare war,[1249] but its legislative power, though never\r\nlost, was infrequently asserted after the recognition of sovereignty in\r\nthe two assemblies of the tribes which were more easily summoned and\r\norganised.\r\n\r\nBut not only did the tribe assemblies infringe the power of those of the\r\ncenturies, they became the later model of the latter, and the tendency\r\nto detract from the influence of wealth was shown in the reorganisation\r\nof the _comitia centuriata_ on a tribal basis.[1250] The date of this\r\nchange is unknown; but, as the redistribution of the centuries in its\r\nfinal form assumes the existence of thirty-five tribes, the alteration\r\nmay not be earlier than the year 241 B.C. The leading principle of the\r\nnew arrangement was that the five classes were distributed over all the\r\ntribes in such a manner that there were two centuries of each class—one\r\ncentury of _seniores_ and one of _juniores_—in a single tribe. Each\r\nclass thus had two votes in a tribe and seventy votes in all. The\r\neighteen centuries of knights still stood outside the tribe; so did the\r\nfour centuries of _fabri_, _accensi_, _tibicines_ and _cornicines_,\r\nand the fifth century of _proletarii_ which probably existed at this\r\ntime.[1251] The total number of centuries would thus be 373 (350 + 18\r\n+ 5). The majority of this number is 187, but the first class and the\r\n_equites_ together now have but 88 votes, thus losing their preponderance\r\nin voting power. In spite of this arrangement by tribes there is no\r\ntribal vote. The unit of voting is still the century, and it is the\r\nnumber of centuries that decides the question. The organisation is still\r\nby classes, the seventy centuries of each class voting as distinct\r\nbodies.[1252] The _equites_ seem still to have had the right of voting\r\nfirst,[1253] and the first class took precedence of the others; for the\r\nlot which designated the _centuria praerogativa_[1254] seems to have\r\nbeen cast only amongst the seventy groups of _seniores_ and _juniores_\r\nbelonging to this class.[1255]\r\n\r\nThe restoration by Sulla of the older method of voting (88 B.C.)[1256]\r\nwas not a permanent reform. It disappeared during the Cinnan reaction,\r\nand it is questionable whether it was renewed by the dictator. If it was,\r\nit soon vanished with other items of his aristocratic reorganisation.\r\n\r\nThe _comitia tributa_ was the most handy of all the assemblies of the\r\nfull Populus, and was, consequently, the most frequently employed for\r\nthe passing of _leges_. Its presidents were the patrician magistrates,\r\nusually the consuls and praetors and, for purposes of jurisdiction, the\r\ncurule aediles. It elected these aediles and other lower magistrates\r\nof the people, as well as the twenty-four tribunes of the first four\r\nlegions. Its jurisdiction was limited to pecuniary penalties.\r\n\r\nThe _concilium plebis_, practically the sovereign body of the state,\r\ndiffered from this last assembly in two respects. It could be summoned\r\nonly by plebeian magistrates and it never included the Patricians.[1257]\r\nBesides issuing universally valid decrees (_plebiscita_), it elected\r\nthe magistrates of the Plebs, and in its judicial capacity was the\r\nbody which considered the penalties which they had formulated. By the\r\nstrict letter of the Twelve Tables this jurisdiction should have been\r\nlimited to the imposition of fines,[1258] but, besides instances of its\r\ncapital jurisdiction at an early period of its history, it continued\r\nto possess the unquestioned right of pronouncing outlawry (_aquae et\r\nignis interdictio_) against any one already in exile,[1259] and after\r\nthe time of Caius Gracchus there are traces of an independent capital\r\njurisdiction which it exercised against magistrates who had violated the\r\n_provocatio_.[1260]\r\n\r\nThe freedom of this plebeian assembly was for a time limited by Sulla’s\r\nordinance (88 B.C.) directing that no measure should be brought before\r\nit which had not received the previous sanction of the Senate;[1261] but\r\nthe old powers of unimpeded legislation were restored in 70 B.C. If Sulla\r\nalso took the right of prosecution from the tribune,[1262] the higher\r\njurisdiction of the Plebs was restored by the enactment which gave it\r\nback its legislative power, for tribunician prosecutions continue to the\r\nend of the Republic.\r\n\r\nAn anomalous use of the popular suffrage was made in the case of\r\nelections to the priestly colleges. Formerly they had been kept distinct\r\nfrom the secular life of the state, and even when the reforming spirit\r\ndictated that they should be submitted to the voice of the people,\r\na religious scruple forbade the intervention of the _comitia_. The\r\nelectoral body was composed of seventeen tribes selected by lot from\r\nthe thirty-five, and this body, which was _not_ the Populus,[1263] was\r\npresided over by a pontiff.[1264] This organisation was probably first\r\napplied about the middle of the third century B.C. to the creation of\r\nthe _pontifex maximus_: it received a great extension at the close of\r\nthe second century. A Domitian law, a _plebiscitum_ of 104 B.C., applied\r\nelection in a modified form to the religious _collegia_—probably to the\r\nfour great guilds of pontiffs, augurs, quindecemvirs, and epulones. The\r\ncollege in question presented, the people elected and gave to the college\r\nagain a _congé d’élire_, whereupon the chosen candidate was solemnly\r\ncoopted by the members of his guild.[1265] Sulla abolished this mode\r\nof appointment, and perhaps with it the popular election of the chief\r\npontiff, restoring the aristocratic mode of cooptation; but appointment\r\nby the seventeen tribes was restored again in 63 B.C., through a\r\nplebiscite of the tribune Labienus.[1266]\r\n\r\nOur final task in connexion with the people and its powers will be to\r\ndescribe the preliminaries to the meetings of the _comitia_ and the\r\n_concilium_, and the mode in which business was transacted at these\r\ngatherings.\r\n\r\nThe legal days of meeting (_comitiales dies_) were those which were\r\nneither holy (_nefasti_) nor dedicated to the work of justice (_fasti_).\r\nThe 194 days thus left clear were further broken into by the _nundinae_,\r\nthe first days of the eight-day week, on which not even a _contio_ could\r\nbe held,[1267] and by the movable festivals (_feriae conceptivae_) which\r\nwere fixed by the magistrates. These rules of time were binding on all\r\nmeetings of Populus and Plebs; those of place differed for the various\r\nassemblies. The assembly of the _curiae_ met within the _pomerium_,\r\nusually in the Comitium on the north-west of the Forum.[1268] The\r\ncenturies, on the other hand, must meet without the walls, and their\r\nplace of assembly was usually the Campus Martius, but meetings are\r\nsometimes found in other places such as “the Peteline grove outside the\r\nriver-gate,” and an unknown site called the Aesculetum.[1269] The two\r\nassemblies of the tribes were originally bound to no locality, except for\r\nthe fact that the plebeian, as purely city, magistrates could not easily\r\nfind their way outside the walls. But the eliciting of a _rogatio_ from\r\nthe tribes by the consul in his camp at Sutrium in 357 B.C. led, through\r\nthe fear of military influence, to the rule that no resolution should\r\nbe elicited from the people in the military domain,[1270] and since\r\nthat date the two assemblies of the tribes were held within the first\r\nmilestone. The open space of the Capitol (_area Capitolii_) was at one\r\ntime their usual resort both for elections and for laws, but in the later\r\nperiod of the Republic it was found convenient to conduct the elections\r\nboth of the lower and plebeian magistrates in the Campus Martius, while\r\nthe Rostra in the Forum, the usual centre of demagogic strife and the\r\nordinary gathering place for _contiones_, was chosen as the site for the\r\nlegislation of the tribes.[1271]\r\n\r\nThe first step in the intercourse of a magistrate with the people, which\r\nwas to produce a binding act, was the setting forth by the former of a\r\ndecree specifying the day of meeting,[1272] and describing the nature\r\nof the act which he meant to introduce. This promulgation[1273] assumed\r\nvarious forms in accordance with the purpose of the projected meeting.\r\nIn prosecutions it contained the name of the accused, the nature of\r\nthe charge, and the penalty proposed; in elections at least the places\r\nto be filled, but probably in later times a list of the candidates as\r\nwell;[1274] in legislation the text of the law which was to be the\r\nsubject of the _rogatio_. No provision seems to have been made that\r\nthe text should remain unaltered until a Licinio-Junian law of 62 B.C.\r\nprovided that a copy of the promulgated enactment should be deposited in\r\nthe _aerarium_ as a guarantee that no amendment was inserted before the\r\npeople was asked to accept it.[1275]\r\n\r\nThe minimum interval between the promulgation and the meeting was the\r\nspace of three _nundina_, i.e. 24 days, and this condition was as\r\nnecessary for jurisdiction and elections as for laws.[1276] On the\r\nappointed day the first act of the magistrate, who meant to guide a\r\nmeeting of the Populus, was the _auspicatio_ in the sacred enclosure\r\n(_templum_) which formed the centre of the gathering. Celestial signs\r\nalone[1277] seem to have been the object of this morning watch; but\r\nno such observation was necessary for plebeian gatherings; they were\r\ndisturbed only by _auspicia oblativa_.[1278] The auspices had been taken\r\nbefore sunrise, and if they were favourable the herald was then sent\r\nround the walls inviting the people to meet the magistrate at dawn.[1279]\r\nThis was sufficient for the _comitia_ of the tribes.[1280] For the\r\ncenturies more elaborate preparations were necessary. Proclamation of\r\nthe meeting was made from the Rostra, and the red flag flew from the\r\nJaniculum to show that it was guarded while the army was busy in the\r\nCampus.[1281] The military horn was blown on the _arx_ and round the\r\nwalls, and, if the summons was for a court of justice, before the house\r\nof the accused.[1282]\r\n\r\nWhen the people were assembled the president opened with a prayer,[1283]\r\nand the _rogatio_ was read with the request whether the quirites “will\r\nand order it” (_velitis_, _jubeatis_). The magistrate is now addressing\r\na _contio_, and the _rogatio_ is subjected to a limited discussion. The\r\npresident explains and advises it, and the officials or senators whom he\r\nhas assembled express their support or dissent.[1284] This discussion\r\nalways preceded acts of legislation.[1285] When the _comitia_ met for\r\njurisdiction there may have been some debate even in the _quarta\r\naccusatio_;[1286] it was probably only at elections that it was wholly\r\nabsent.\r\n\r\nWhen the discussion was over the _contio_ was dissolved. Those who had\r\nno votes were dismissed from the enclosure;[1287] to those with votes\r\nthe magistrate said, “Si vobis videtur, discedite, quirites,”[1288]\r\nthus asking them to divide up into their separate compartments, whether\r\ntribes or curiae or centuries. The enclosure was deemed large enough to\r\nhold all the privileged citizens, although where such a space could have\r\nbeen found on the Capitol or in the Forum is one of the mysteries of\r\nRoman topography. This enclosure was divided longitudinally into as many\r\ncompartments (_consaepta_) as there were voting divisions. Each division\r\nwas connected with the magistrate’s tribunal through a gallery (_pons_)\r\nrunning the whole length of the enclosure, this high gallery being\r\nconnected with the various voting compartments by separate descending\r\n_pontes_.\r\n\r\nThe votes in each compartment were taken singly, and were given at the\r\nexits of the various _pontes_. During the greater part of Republican\r\nhistory votes were given verbally, the tellers (_rogatores_) marking\r\nthem off on tablets by means of points (_puncta_).[1289] In legislation\r\nthe affirmative answer was _uti rogas_, the negative _antiquo_; in\r\njurisdiction acquittal and condemnation were pronounced by _libero_\r\nand _damno_; in elections _dico_ and _facio_ seem to have been\r\nemployed.[1290] But in the latter half of the second century of the\r\nRepublic the ballot was introduced. The change was gradual. Secrecy\r\nwas first secured for elections by the _lex Gabinia_ of 139, and for\r\njurisdiction, with the exception of cases of treason (_perduellio_),\r\nby the _lex Cassia_ of 137. The _lex Papiria_ of 131 extended the\r\nprinciple to legislation, and finally the _lex Caelia_ of 107 admitted\r\nit for cases of treason.[1291] In legislation and jurisdiction the old\r\nformulae were retained, the tablets which were distributed being marked\r\nV and A, or L and C. For the purpose of elections blank tablets were\r\ndistributed on which the voters wrote the names.[1292] The _tabellae_\r\nwere now thrown into an urn (_cista_) at the exit of each _pons_. The\r\nreckoning of the votes (_diribitio_) was in the hands of tellers who were\r\nsometimes called by the old name _rogatores_, but were also spoken of\r\nas _diribitores_.[1293] The _cistae_ were watched by public _custodes_,\r\nand in the case of elections the candidates were allowed to place one\r\nguardian at each urn.[1294]\r\n\r\nThe issue was decided by the vote of the groups. In the assemblies\r\nof the curiae and the tribes the voting of the groups took place\r\nsimultaneously, in that of the centuries in the order which we have\r\nalready described.[1295] In the two former assemblies the order in\r\nwhich the votes of the groups were proclaimed had thus to be decided by\r\nlot.[1296] The reading (_pronuntatio_, _recitatio_) was continued only\r\nto the point at which an absolute majority for or against the measure\r\nhad been obtained. When sixteen curiae or eighteen tribes were found to\r\nhave given the same vote, it ceased, and the formal announcement of the\r\nresult (_renuntiatio_) was then made by the magistrate. In the _comitia\r\ncenturiata_ the announcement of the result might be reached without\r\nall the centuries being called on to vote, since the result of each\r\nvote was proclaimed immediately after the group had given it, and the\r\nneedful majority might be reached before all the groups had voted. The\r\nabsolute majority was required in elections as well as in legislative\r\nacts, and hence the candidate who gained a mere relative majority was not\r\nreturned.[1297]\r\n\r\nRecords of the voting were kept for some time in case the decision\r\nshould be challenged.[1298] The promulgated _lex_ was, as we saw,\r\ndeposited in the _aerarium_, as laws which had passed must have been\r\nlong before this provision was made, but they were kept without order or\r\nmethod, and skilled assistants were required to ferret out the desired\r\nenactment.[1299] Little regular provision seems to have been made for\r\nthe publication even of recent measures; but those which were considered\r\nimportant were originally painted on wood and later engraved on bronze,\r\nand fixed in temples or other public places.[1300]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE SENATE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Roman constitution, in the form in which we have left it at the\r\nclose of the period of its growth, was the chaotic result of attempts\r\nto arrest internal revolution, and of feeble and misdirected efforts to\r\nreadjust the relations of outworn powers. A state in which three popular\r\nassemblies have each the right of passing binding acts of parliament, in\r\nwhich twenty magistrates with clashing authority have each the right of\r\neliciting the sovereign will of the people, possesses no organisation\r\nwhich can satisfy the need for which constitutions exist—the ordered\r\narrangement of all the wants of civic life by means of a series of\r\nuniform acts possessing perpetual validity. It is true that the search\r\nfor a personal authority is the object of theoretic, not of practical,\r\ninquiry. The average man, who is fortunately the power that in the long\r\nrun determines the shape that politics shall assume, seeks law alone and\r\ncares nothing for its source. The vagueness of the ultimate power does\r\nnot affect him, if the rules it lays down are rigid and binding; he will\r\naccept principles in place of persons, and by doing so he proves that he\r\nis more scientific than the scientists. But the fundamental principles\r\nthat lie behind the personal power in a state are too vast in their\r\nscope to apply immediately to the needs of human life. They require\r\ninterpretation by means of legislative and executive authorities; and if\r\nthese acts of interpretation are to have the character of principles,\r\nthe dictating authorities must have a fixed character and a permanent\r\nlife, and there must be some guarantee that they shall submit their\r\njudgments to the accumulated experience of the past. No such character\r\nand no such guarantee were to be found in the existing elements of the\r\nRoman state which had strict legal recognition. The _comitia_ could,\r\nlike a parliament in a modern state where no provision for a constituent\r\nassembly exists, go on in an endless career of constitution-making; the\r\nmagistrates could interpret the laws at their own will, and by fighting\r\nout the merits of their rival interpretations amongst themselves paralyse\r\nthe state or plunge it into anarchy. It was felt that a central power\r\nmust reside somewhere, a power which should guide the people and control\r\nthe magistrates, a power which should above all avert the terrible\r\nconflicts between rival authorities so amply encouraged by the existing\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nIt was scarcely necessary, at any one point in the growth of the Roman\r\nconstitution, to raise the question where this power was to be found. A\r\nchain of circumstances, some internal and some external, had provided\r\na body of men possessing the three main qualifications necessary for\r\nthe exercise of central authority—permanence, experience, and the free\r\npower of deliberation. With every step in the professed extension of\r\npopular privilege the power of the Roman Senate had increased; and the\r\nexplanation of this anomaly is to be found in the fact on which we have\r\nalready dwelt, that the distribution of authority amongst the popular\r\nassemblies, and the increase in the number of the magistracies, had\r\ninvolved such a weakening of the authority of magistrates and people as\r\nto render both incapable of any pretence at effective rule. The long\r\nseries of wars in which Rome was engaged, from the commencement of the\r\nstruggle with Pyrrhus to the close of the third contest with Carthage,\r\nand the new duties of administration entailed by the organisation of\r\nItaly and of the earlier provinces, exhibited this incapacity in a still\r\nmore glaring light. But the growth of the Senate’s authority cannot be\r\nattributed mainly to the necessities of external administration; for the\r\nfundamental changes which conditioned its pre-eminence had come when\r\nRome was little more than a city-state, and the Senate would have ruled\r\nhad Rome continued to govern a tract of territory no larger than that\r\npossessed by a Cretan city. The Empire was the final ratification, the\r\nseal of the Senate’s authority; but the origin of this authority is to be\r\nfound, not in the accident of conquest, but in the working of the Roman\r\nmind itself.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances which determined the growth of the power of this\r\ngreat council of state are connected, firstly, with the constitution of\r\nthe council itself; secondly, with the changes in its presidency; and\r\nthirdly, with its absorption of isolated powers, some of which it drew\r\nfrom the incompetent hands of magistrates and people, others of which it\r\ncreated.\r\n\r\n(i.) A nominee body, such as the Senate had originally been, may be\r\nmoulded by the will of the nominator. The personal selection by the\r\nconsuls of their intimate friends, the habit of omitting, at the annual\r\nrevision of the list, the names of those who were alien to them in\r\nsympathy, while favouring the dignity of the aristocracy by making it\r\nappear as though exclusion were based on arbitrary preference and not on\r\ncensure, yet diminished the independence and lessened the prestige of\r\nthe councillors thus arbitrarily selected. It is true that the work of\r\nselection was performed by two consuls, and the judgment of the one might\r\nbe balanced by the prejudice of the other; it is also true that public\r\nopinion would have been shocked by the choice of unworthy members of the\r\nmagisterial council, and that the aristocracy itself would have resented\r\nthe omission of a name distinguished by the great deeds of its possessor\r\nwhile in office; but the self-existence of this council could only be\r\nsecured by the one great device of taking from the magistrate, whose duty\r\nit was to consult, the selection of the men whose duty it was to furnish\r\nhim with advice. An opportunity for effecting this change was offered by\r\nthe institution of the censorship. The selection of the Senate (_lectio\r\nsenatus_) is indeed no part of the _census_, nor do we know when this\r\nhighest of all the privileges of the censors was transferred to the new\r\nauthority. But by the year 312 not only, as we have seen,[1301] had the\r\ntransference been effected, but conditions of selection had been imposed\r\nwhich made the Senate partly a body of ex-curule magistrates, partly of\r\nnominees who had done good service to the state in the lesser grades\r\nof the magistracy or the higher ranks of the army. The vista that lay\r\nbefore the eyes of all aspirants to office was now no longer the annual\r\nmagistracy, temporary in its nature and hampered by restrictions of every\r\nkind, but the seat in the Senate to which it was the stepping-stone.\r\nWithin the charmed circle the grades of rank were still of importance,\r\nand the “servants of the order,”[1302] as the magistrates now tended\r\nto become, could find in the magnificent displays of the aedile, the\r\nhigh judicial functions of the praetor, the military leadership of the\r\nconsul, and the moral control of the censor, the graduated satisfaction\r\nof the most diverse ambitions. But, even before the point of transition\r\nmarked by the curule magistracy had been passed, the Roman noble tended\r\nto identify his interests with those of the house to which fate and the\r\ninevitable suffrages of the people had destined him. Interest even more\r\nthan conviction would sanction such a choice; the vast nominal powers\r\nof the magistracy he could wield but for a year; of the clique of Three\r\nHundred he was a life-long member. And the depressing influence, which\r\ncontact with some scores of middle-aged and experienced men must have\r\nover youth even when blessed with genius, completed the work which\r\ninterest and a vague class sympathy had begun. The new member moved in\r\nthat narrow circle of ideas which through its very narrowness was strong\r\nenough to baffle Pyrrhus, Hannibal, and Philip, and to half complete\r\nthe organisation of the world. The men that rose above it—Scipio, the\r\nGracchi, Caesar—found endless difficulties in their path, and originality\r\nof conception, which is conspicuous by its absence in the organisation\r\nof the Roman Empire, led its possessors to exile, death, or monarchy.\r\nBut the restraining influence was felt only in the essential principles\r\nof politics; in the control of details a free hand was still given to\r\nthe administrator, and individuality of a uniform, decorous, and sober\r\nkind, combined with a high average level of practical ability, is to\r\nbe found in the Roman senator of the best period. The narrowness of\r\ninterest, the selfishness and the corruption, which are the besetting\r\nsins of a corporation with an assured tenure of rule, were also weakened\r\nin the case of the Roman Senate by the fact that, through the elective\r\nprinciple, it was always in constant touch with the people. It is true\r\nthat the Senate was a parliament, the members of which were elected for\r\nlife—a parliament, therefore, that might easily cease to represent the\r\nwishes of the electorate; but each member, until he obtained the coveted\r\nprize of the consulship, was ever submitting himself to the suffrages\r\nof the people in order to pass from grade to grade of honour. The\r\nsusceptibilities of the “great tame beast” had to be respected; its eyes\r\nmust be dazzled by occasional popular measures, by military achievements,\r\nat the worst by private bounty or by brilliant shows. The coterie system\r\nthat worked the elections could do much, but it could not do everything;\r\nthe race for honours provided _stimuli_ sufficient—even when the public\r\nopinion of his own order failed—to keep a counsellor of Rome up to a high\r\nlevel of efficiency.\r\n\r\nAn order of nobility that is practically hereditary tends to attach\r\nto itself titles of nobility and external distinctions of dress. The\r\ndemocratic nomenclature of the Romans prevented the development of\r\nthe first, and although within the Senate the grades of rank were\r\nclearly marked, and the distinctions between _consulates_, _praetorii_,\r\n_aedilicii_ and the former holders of lesser magistracies were observed\r\nin the order of debate, these designations were not employed as constant\r\nepithets. But the desire of emphasising difference of functions by\r\nexternal signs, which is such a strongly marked feature in Roman public\r\nlife, revealed itself fully in the senatorial garb. The present or past\r\nholder of curule office wore the purple-striped toga of the magistrate,\r\nthe ordinary senator bore on his tunic a stripe of the same colour, which\r\nduring the last century of the Republic was distinguished by its breadth\r\nfrom that worn by the order of the equites. Still more distinctly a\r\npart of the senatorial _insignia_ is the senatorial shoe of red leather\r\n(_calceus mulleus_), which, distinct in shape as well as in colour, was\r\nworn by no other members of the state. The origin of the distinction is\r\nobscure; tradition explained the sandal as the royal footgear,[1303]\r\nwhich continued to be worn by the patrician senators in their character\r\nof potential kings (_interreges_).[1304] The gold ring the senators\r\nshared with the members of the equestrian order. Since the nobility of a\r\nsenator ended with his life, it is needless to remark that the _insignia_\r\ncould not be transmitted to descendants. Yet, as some of them—the gold\r\nring and perhaps the _latus clavus_—had merely a social sanction, it is\r\nnot improbable that the practically hereditary nature of the nobility had\r\nled to their being worn by members of senatorial families destined to\r\nfollow their fathers’ career. There is, at least, no reason to suppose\r\nthat the youthful order of _laticlavii_ was an invention of the Emperor\r\nAugustus.[1305]\r\n\r\nThe identification of the magistracy with the Senate, which had been\r\npractically complete by the close of the third century of the Republic,\r\nwas perfected in law by the dictator Sulla. The quaestorship was now\r\nmade the stepping-stone to the Senate;[1306] the personal selection by\r\nthe censors—which, in the face of unwritten custom, had been growing\r\nweaker year by year—was dispensed with; while their more important\r\nright of rejecting unworthy members could be resorted to only when the\r\ncensorship was occasionally galvanised into new life. An automatic mode\r\nof recruiting the order should, if the power and dignity contemplated\r\nby the reactionary legislator were to be secured, have been accompanied\r\nby an equally automatic method of divesting of their rank those who had\r\nproved unworthy of it. But no such system was devised, and the morals\r\nof the Senate were for the first time left to chance, or rather to the\r\nreasonable hope that after the age of thirty-one (the lowest period of\r\nlife at which senatorial dignity could be held) the character once formed\r\nwould not deteriorate.\r\n\r\nA more important factor in the change introduced by the Cornelian\r\nlegislation was the permanent increase in the numbers of the Senate.\r\nDoubled by the immediate action of the dictator, the body continued to\r\nmaintain its complement of about 600 members; for twenty annual additions\r\nof ex-magistrates of the usual quaestorian age would enable it to retain\r\nthis normal level. The large size thus given to the senatorial body is\r\none of its most surprising features, when we consider the business with\r\nwhich it had to deal. Secrets that are uttered with bated breath in a\r\nmodern cabinet were proclaimed aloud at Rome to an assembly of the size\r\nof a modern parliament. But there were no reports of proceedings for\r\nthe eyes or ears of the outside world, and secrecy about reasons for\r\npolicy was sometimes only too well kept. Such secrecy was often treated\r\nas suspicious by the professed leaders of the people at the close of the\r\nRepublic, and the consciousness of danger felt in the Senate seemed mere\r\nweakness to the mob. The history of the Senate, if it does not show the\r\nfutility of secret diplomacy, may yet prove it to be unnecessary that\r\nthis diplomacy to be effective should be entrusted to a few.\r\n\r\n(ii.) The freedom and power of a deliberative assembly depends very\r\nlargely on the unrestricted right of debate and initiative possessed\r\nby its individual members. In theory the Roman senator was sorely\r\nhampered in the exercise of both of these powers. The body to which he\r\nbelonged ever retained its formal character of a council of advisers;\r\nthe magistrate might summon it or not at his discretion, might refuse\r\nto lay a particular question before the house, or decline to elicit\r\nthe opinions (_sententiae_) of some suspected members, opinions which\r\nthey had no power to give unasked. So long as these powers were in the\r\nhands of two consuls, a conspiracy of silence might easily impede the\r\nexpression of the Senate’s judgment; but when the right of summoning and\r\nof laying business before the house became the property of the praetors\r\nin virtue of their _imperium_, and was subsequently, by an anomalous\r\nrecognition of a revolutionary power, extended to the tribunate, the\r\nnumber of possible presidents was increased to twenty, and the Senate\r\nagain drew its strength from the dissensions of the magistrates. Twenty\r\nmen, even if they all represent a nobility, must also represent different\r\nshades of opinion, and will attempt to elicit views corresponding to\r\ntheir own, which may then be submitted to the approval and the votes of\r\nthe house. The practice having early arisen that it was only a definite\r\nexpression of opinion coming from some quarter of the house that should\r\nbe submitted to the approval of its members, the magistrate, eager to\r\nput the desired motion (_relatio_), is now to a large extent dependent\r\non the senator. And the few gaps that still remain in the latter’s power\r\nof initiative are filled up by ingenious fictions of debate. The senator\r\nwould rise, unburden his soul of cherished views on matters alien to the\r\ndebate,[1307] and then make his speech conform to the rules of the house\r\nby concluding with a formal opinion on the direct issue put before it by\r\nthe magistrate. In one instance at least we find the method reversed;\r\nthe great political crime of Carthage’s destruction was prepared by the\r\nfamous _sententia_ of Cato,[1308] often repeated in speeches on unrelated\r\ntopics, and having no connexion with the issue that was directly before\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nTo understand the facilities for information and the freedom of debate\r\npossessed by the Senate, we must have a clear view of the functions\r\nof its presidents and of the position of the ordinary magistrates in\r\nthat assembly. The right of summons and the right of laying business\r\nbefore the body were inseparable; both were possessed by three orders\r\nof magistrates—consuls, praetors, and tribunes. But law, in the shape\r\nof the power given by the _major potestas_, made it impossible for the\r\npraetor to exercise his right of summons in defiance of the consul; while\r\ncustom dictated that even the tribune should not exercise this right\r\nwhen the consul was at Rome. But, once the summons has been issued and\r\nobeyed, the convoker of the council is not its only president. The three\r\nclasses of magistrates have each the right of reference, and each in\r\nan order prescribed by customary law. The consuls’ motions come first;\r\nthey are followed by those of the praetors, and then the tribunes have\r\ntheir turn.[1309] This system of priority, although necessary to prevent\r\nconfusion, was under ordinary circumstances a matter of comparative\r\nunimportance. It could only become a serious hindrance to the freedom of\r\ndebate if the consul abruptly dismissed the meeting before a decision\r\nhad been reached on some question of pressing importance,[1310] or\r\nif a method of systematic obstruction were adopted by some senator,\r\nwho wasted the hours with prolix oratory until the setting of the sun\r\nmade a suspension of business legally necessary. But the former device\r\nwas revolutionary in its character, and on the occasion of its use a\r\nfit preparation for a revolution; while the latter seems to have been\r\nemployed, as by the younger Cato during Caesar’s consulship, as a\r\nweapon against an offensive _relatio_ already before the house.[1311]\r\nThe president himself had ample powers for meeting such designs; in the\r\ncase in question the consul had the obstructive stoic haled from the\r\nroom.[1312]\r\n\r\nA more serious danger would have been the absence of information from the\r\nofficials who succeeded the consul in putting motions before the house;\r\nbut this was obviated by the power which magistrates had of speaking\r\n(_verba facere_) without invitation at any period of the debate. This\r\npower was possessed as an admitted right by those magistrates who were\r\nthemselves presiding; the quaestors, whose financial statements were\r\nindispensable, and the aediles may have exercised it only on sufferance.\r\nThis privilege was the more necessary as the presiding magistrates\r\nat least could not be asked their opinion by the official who held\r\nthe attention of the house; they could not give advice, for they were\r\nthemselves seeking it of others.\r\n\r\nCustom had determined with equal care the method by which opinions should\r\nbe elicited from the unofficial and advising members of the house. The\r\nquestion “what is your advice?” (_quid censes?_) was put by the president\r\nto each senator in an order corresponding to his official rank. In the\r\ndays of the activity of the censorship, it was this magistracy which\r\nhad determined the president’s first selection; the censors had placed\r\nat the head of their list the name of some distinguished man (often\r\nhimself an ex-censor), and it was this “chief of the Senate” (_princeps\r\nsenatus_) whose opinion was first sought. But, after Sulla’s reform in\r\nthe constitution of the order, there is, in spite of the occasional\r\nrevival of the censorship, no certain evidence of the perpetuation of\r\nthis dignity. Henceforth a body of _consulates_ holds the first place,\r\nand from these the presiding magistrate—at least the consul who opens the\r\nbusiness of the house—chooses his first adviser, according to no settled\r\nrules, but with due regard to seniority or personal distinction.[1313]\r\nThe only exception to this practice was to be found in the latter\r\nhalf of the year, when the consuls elect, either in virtue of their\r\nquasi-magisterial position or because they might themselves have to\r\ncarry out the decrees which were being discussed, took precedence of\r\nthe consulars.[1314] From the latter the question passed down through\r\nthe _praetorii_ to the men of aedilician or tribunician rank, and so\r\nfinally to the lowest grade of all—the ex-quaestors; and it is probable\r\nthat, in every grade, the rule of consulting a designated magistrate\r\nbefore an ex-magistrate was observed. It is obvious that this procedure,\r\nwhen rigidly adhered to, left the non-curule members of the Senate only\r\nan infinitesimal chance of a share in the debate. These had always been\r\nknown as _pedarii_, in contradistinction to the _curules_; originally\r\nnominees of the censors, they included after the time of Sulla the\r\nformer tribunes and plebeian aediles, and the members of quaestorian\r\nrank. As they were rarely reached in the debate, they seldom had the\r\nopportunity of expressing an opinion, and hence arose the erroneous\r\nnotion of some antiquarians that the _pedarii_ were given the right\r\nof voting but not the power of debate.[1315] But restrictions of this\r\nkind, arising from practice and not from law, were never pressed by the\r\nRomans. The repute of a man who had not reached curule rank might exceed\r\nthat of all the other senators; the principle that would open the lips\r\nof a Bibulus and close those of a Cato was recognised as mischievous in\r\ncertain emergencies, and it was the latter who as tribune elect—that is,\r\nas a _pedarius_—moved the resolution which condemned the Catilinarian\r\nconspirators to death.[1316]\r\n\r\nFrom the mass of opinions elicited in the course of the debate, the\r\npresident might choose any that he pleased to submit to the judgment\r\nof the house. The safeguard of the individual senator was here found\r\nin the number of the presiding magistrates. As a rule the same order\r\nwas followed in putting _sententiae_ to the vote as had been observed\r\nin eliciting them; but out of an aggregate of opinions that, with\r\ndifferences of detail, gave practically the same advice, the president\r\nmight choose that which he considered most to the point or best worded\r\nas the one to be submitted to his council. It was certainly an unusual\r\nstep when, in the historic debate of December 5 in the year 63 B.C.,\r\nCicero put to the vote the _sententia_ of Cato in place of the similar\r\nbut weaker resolutions of the _consulares_;[1317] but the consul in this\r\nexercise of his discretionary choice was acting well within his rights.\r\n\r\nOne is sometimes surprised, considering the rigidity of the procedure\r\nand the size of the body, at the amount of business that appears to have\r\nbeen transacted at a single meeting of the Senate. But both the rules\r\nof procedure and the Roman temperament account for the rapidity of the\r\ndebate. As regards the former it must be remembered that no motion could\r\nbe put unless pressed by a magistrate, that there was no distinction\r\nbetween substantive motions and amendments, that alternative proposals,\r\ntherefore, had not to be submitted in detail to a division, that the\r\ncarrying of one motion generally swept all _sententiae_ on the same\r\nsubject aside, that motions for adjournment did not take precedence of\r\nother motions, and that the business of the house was not interrupted\r\nby this modern device for wasting time. We must also remember that a\r\ndivision in the modern sense of the word was rare, and that it appears\r\nseldom to have been necessary to take the numbers of the members who\r\nrespectively supported or were adverse to a motion.[1318] The estimate\r\nof the voting was in fact going on during the debate; it was the custom\r\nof the senator, often without rising, to express a few words of assent\r\nto a former speech,[1319] and it was not unusual to leave one’s bench\r\nand take up a position near the man whose opinion one supported.[1320]\r\nThe sense of the house could thus often be taken before the debate\r\nhad ended; where it was not obvious the consul urged to a division\r\n(_discessio_);[1321] even then it is improbable that recourse was had to\r\ncounting, unless the parties on either side were very evenly balanced.\r\nOther reasons for rapidity were to be found in the Roman temperament\r\nand in the intellectual atmosphere of the house. The Roman, until his\r\nbetter nature was corrupted by the schools of Athens and Rhodes, was a\r\nman of few words; the Senate was the least likely body in the world to\r\nbe swayed by florid eloquence; clearness and brevity were the qualities\r\nmost in demand, and even at the close of the Republic, when the Senate\r\nhad surrendered itself to the perilous pleasure of listening to carefully\r\nwoven sentences, the “paint pots” of Cicero[1322] were still in all\r\nprobability the exception and not the rule.\r\n\r\nThe voice of the majority of the Senate was embodied in a resolution\r\n(_senatus consultum_). Considered as the mere advice of the magistrates’\r\ncouncil it had no legal validity whatever; its binding character sprang\r\nfrom the fact that it was a decree of the magistrate applying to a sphere\r\nin which he was himself competent to issue such injunctions. Hence, as\r\nwe have seen,[1323] the veto pronounced on a decree of the Senate by\r\nthe colleague or superior of the magistrate who has elicited it, is\r\nno exception to the rule that the acts of corporations or of private\r\nindividuals were not subject to this form of invalidation. So little\r\nwas this the case that, when the decree had been vetoed, the advice of\r\nthe Senate still remained unimpaired. The annulled resolution was still\r\ndrawn up, but it had become an _auctoritas_ merely.[1324] It was still of\r\nsufficient potency to bind constitutionally-minded magistrates, but it no\r\nlonger imposed the duty of obeying it on the community. The _consultum_\r\nor _auctoritas_ was drawn up at the place of meeting soon after the\r\nresolution which it embodied had been passed. As there were no permanent\r\nofficials of a responsible character to see to its redaction, a small\r\ncommittee was appointed by the president to attest the genuineness of the\r\ndocument;[1325] this consisted usually of the author of the resolution\r\nand of some of his supporters.\r\n\r\n(iii.) The Senate exerted its developed authority under two different\r\naspects. It was the body which exercised the power of previous\r\ndeliberation on matters which must be submitted to the judgment of a\r\nnominally higher authority, the people, and it was a council which\r\nprofessed to give final directions to the magistrates on the conduct\r\nof their administrative duties. It possessed no sphere of its own in\r\nwhich it could act unassisted by magistrates and people, and thus its\r\nformal independence is far less than that possessed by such a body as\r\nthe Athenian _Boulê_. The only department of state in which it seems to\r\nhave independent authority—the power of perpetuating the very life of the\r\n_civitas_ by the appointment of an interrex—belongs strictly not to the\r\nSenate but to its patrician members; and even for the exercise of this\r\nright during the Republic the motive power had to spring ultimately from\r\na magistrate of the Plebs.[1326]\r\n\r\nThe Senate by exercising a probouleutic authority showed its sense of\r\nits own limitations. Occasionally, as we shall see, it usurped isolated\r\npowers that belonged of right to the people; but as a rule its final\r\nauthority was only felt in that vast sphere of executive influence that\r\nhad been formerly entrusted to the magistrates. It could control, but\r\nit might not usurp, the sovereign powers of the people; it elected no\r\nmagistrates; it possessed no legislative authority; it could not declare\r\nwar or make peace; it dared not extend the limits of Roman citizenship\r\nby the conferment of the franchise; it made no claim to the exercise of\r\njurisdiction or of the still more sovereign right of pardon.\r\n\r\nYet, when it is remembered that the activity of the _comitia_ in all\r\nthese matters could only be set in motion by the magistrate, and that\r\nthe Senate’s advice had grown into a real power of control, it is easy\r\nto see that the first step in every measure of importance must come\r\nunder the cognisance of this all-pervading council. Its probouleutic\r\nauthority was based on the observance by the magistrate of certain\r\nunwritten rules, which regulated the exercise both of his positive and\r\nof his negative powers. It was held that no magistrate should question\r\nthe people on any important matter without the Senate’s advice, and\r\nthat he should not decline to exercise this power at its request; that\r\nthe power of veto should be employed only at the discretion of the\r\ncouncil, and that the request for its exercise should not be refused.\r\nThese unwritten principles were, as a rule, strong enough to fetter a\r\nmagistrate’s action by his conviction of their necessity; when this\r\nconviction was not sufficiently strong, the Senate resorted to its last\r\nconstitutional weapon, the veto of a friendly magistrate. For this\r\npurpose the tribunician college was usually employed; its size offered\r\nthe largest scope for differences of opinion, for of the ten legally\r\nsupreme magistrates of the state one at least could generally be found\r\nto whom the Senate’s word was law. The blocking of legislation through\r\nthe _intercessio_ of a senatorial tribune may be illustrated by the\r\nattempt of Octavius to negative the agrarian legislation of the elder\r\nGracchus:[1327] the effort to annul an administrative order of a sweeping\r\nkind by the veto pronounced against the proposal of the praetor Juventius\r\nwhen, without consultation of the Senate and without previous intimation\r\nto the consuls, he attempted to urge the _comitia_ of the people into a\r\ndeclaration of war with Rhodes.[1328]\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the powers of the Senate two courses lie open before us;\r\nwe may either treat them in the order of their growth and show how the\r\nsuccessive usurpations were effected, or we may describe them as they\r\nexisted in their developed form. The first method would have more of an\r\nhistorical interest, but, apart from its difficulty and obscurity due to\r\nthe frequent lack of evidence, it would result in a wholly unsystematic\r\nclassification of the aggregate of acquired rights. It is preferable,\r\ntherefore, to deal with the Senate’s powers in their developed form, with\r\na preliminary warning that they were gained at very lengthy intervals\r\nand by very different means. Some, such as the control of finance, were\r\nusurped from the magistrate; others, such as the dispensation from laws,\r\nwere stolen from the people; to others again, such as the control of the\r\ndetails of provincial government, the Senate had an altogether peculiar\r\nright, such powers being created during the period of the growth of its\r\nascendency.\r\n\r\nWith the election of magistrates the Senate of the later Republic had\r\nno direct concern, and the people alone claimed the perhaps not wholly\r\nconstitutional right of deposing them. But towards the close of its\r\ntenure of power, when the struggle for existence caused it to strain\r\nits prerogatives to the utmost limit, we find the Senate claiming the\r\nvery analogous right of suspending a magistrate from the exercise of\r\nthe functions of his office. A charge of turbulent proceedings was the\r\nmotive for the suspension of Caesar from the praetorship, and of Metellus\r\nNepos from the tribunate in 62,[1329] and Caelius Rufus was ejected,\r\non the allegation of similar misconduct, from the curule chair of the\r\npraetor in 48.[1330] The use of this power against the praetor, or indeed\r\nagainst any magistrate subject to the _major potestas_ of the tribune,\r\nis comprehensible; for the latter might, at the bidding of the Senate,\r\ninhibit any official from the exercise of his customary functions; how\r\nthe power could be employed against the tribunate itself is one of the\r\nhidden mysteries of senatorial usurpation.\r\n\r\nThe power of legislating, that is of establishing fundamental changes\r\nin civic relations, was never claimed by the Senate; nor had it ever\r\npossessed any legal right to suggest or impede the making of a law. The\r\n_patrum auctoritas_, like the _interregnum_, had resided only with the\r\npatrician members of that body; and the power of previous deliberation\r\nclaimed by the later Senate as a whole was merely one of the inevitable\r\nresults of the balance of power within the magistracy. Such slight\r\napproximations to law-making as are found were simply the result of\r\nconsultation by the magistrates on questionable points. The Senate\r\nreaffirmed an ancient principle that the confession of a slave which\r\nmight doom his master to death or exile should not be wrung from him by\r\ntorture;[1331] it might even infringe so much on the freedom of contract\r\nas to suggest a current rate of interest[1332]—a principle which the\r\npraetor might respect if he cared or if his colleague obliged him to do\r\nso.\r\n\r\nBut here again we meet with the strange anomaly that the Senate can\r\ndestroy where it cannot create. It claimed the sovereign privilege of\r\nexempting individuals from the operation of the laws, and the claim\r\nwhich was an admitted usurpation was sanctioned by custom. Formerly the\r\nsovereign people could alone grant such dispensations, but the motion\r\nsubmitted to the people was first approved by the Senate. Very gradually\r\nthe second stage in the proceedings was dropped, for it was considered\r\nthe merely formal sanction of an already accomplished act; and the\r\nsenatorial right of dispensation was assured until it was attacked by\r\nthe tribune Cornelius (67 B.C.). The proposal that it should be restored\r\nto the people was successfully resisted, but a compromise was arrived at\r\nby which it was agreed that no act of dispensation should be valid which\r\nhad not been approved by a house of at least two hundred members.[1333]\r\nThis provision, evidently meant to prevent the abuse of the power for\r\npurely personal or party ends, did not fulfil its purpose, for _senatus\r\nconsulta_ of this kind were gained by influential men on the slightest\r\npretexts and for the most unworthy objects.[1334]\r\n\r\nAn observance of certain forms had always been necessary for the\r\nlegislative activity of the people to be regular and valid. In countries\r\nwhich recognise the sovereignty of parliament, the guardian of such\r\nforms is in the first instance the legislative chamber itself, in the\r\nsecond the courts of justice, which can, or should, be allowed to refuse\r\nto put into effect any law that has been passed in disregard of such\r\nformalities. This was the case at Rome. The laws themselves contained\r\nclauses which pronounced their ineffectiveness in case they should be\r\nfound to violate the principles of the constitution, and the courts of\r\njustice had the courage to resist the enactments even of the provisional\r\ngovernment of the dictator Sulla. But the executive authority might also\r\nhave doubts about the propriety of putting into force a measure which it\r\nrecognised to be irregular; and of this executive authority the Senate\r\nwas the guide. Hence its well-established claim to point out a flaw in\r\na legislative enactment, to establish the fact that the magistrate had\r\nquestioned the people improperly, and that the answer of the people was\r\ntherefore null and void. The exercise of this revising power once led\r\nto the greatest upheaval that Roman history records. It was by pointing\r\nout that the law of the younger Livius Drusus, which contained amongst\r\nits other clauses the gift of _civitas_ to the allies, was irregular\r\nas contravening the condition fixed by a _lex Caecilia Didia_ (98\r\nB.C.) that wholly different enactments should not be contained in the\r\nsame _rogatio_,[1335] that the Senate brought to a head the formidable\r\nconspiracy which culminated in the outbreak of the social war. History\r\nalso brings to our notice the attempted reversal by this means of a\r\npopular judgment of a far smaller kind. It was suggested in the Senate\r\nthat a notice of the alleged irregularities of Clodius’ _plebiscitum_\r\nshould be made the ground of Cicero’s recall; but the exiled orator,\r\nwhile thinking that there was “something in the notion,” yet preferred\r\nthe far safer form of an abrogation of the enactment by the popular voice\r\nitself.[1336]\r\n\r\nWhen we turn from legislation to its complement of jurisdiction we find\r\nlittle direct interference by the Senate with the regular course of\r\neither civil or criminal procedure. On exceptional occasions it might\r\ndecide the sphere of the praetor’s activity,[1337] and by its practical\r\nweight in the declaration of a _justitium_ it might suspend the operation\r\nof the business of the courts; but it did not interfere in the details of\r\nsuch business, and the appeals to the vetoing magistrates were left to\r\ntheir own discretion.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the criminal jurisdiction of the regular courts, although\r\nthe Senate never assumed a faculty for determining the procedure or\r\nthe sentence, it sometimes took the initiative in a prosecution by\r\nsuggesting that a charge should be brought, and this implication _might_\r\nbe contained in a senatorial judgment that a certain course of action\r\nwas _contra rem publicam_.[1338] With respect to an extraordinary\r\ncommission, the true theory of the Republic was that it could be\r\nestablished only by the people. The procedure adopted against Clodius\r\nfor the violation of the rites of the Bona Dea is typical of the\r\nconstitutional method that should always have been employed. The offence\r\nwhich he had committed—though vaguely designated “incest”—was one that\r\nin that particular form was unknown to Roman law. First the college of\r\npontiffs is consulted, and pronounces the act an offence against religion\r\n(_nefas_); then a decree of the Senate is framed specifying the crime and\r\nthe procedure, which is modelled as closely as possible on that of the\r\nordinary criminal courts. This decree is then submitted for ratification\r\nto the judgment of the people.[1339] Acts of attainder are a lamentable\r\nconfession of weakness in a political, social, and legal system; but it\r\nwas right that this weakness should not be remedied by an administrative\r\nauthority representing a single caste.\r\n\r\nBut there were certain emergencies which it was thought could not be met,\r\neven by the establishment of a special judicial commission. Epidemics of\r\ncrime, such as poisoning, arson, murder, seemed to demand the immediate\r\nexercise of the magistrate’s _imperium_, and for this exercise the\r\nSenate is the directing and controlling force. Such an exercise of\r\nmagisterial _coercitio_ at the behest of the Senate is practically a\r\ndeclaration of martial law, although the Senate by its decree does not\r\ncreate a new power, but simply urges the magistrate to set free the\r\nforces latent in his _imperium_. The earlier Republic had provided a\r\nsuspension of constitutional procedure in the form of the dictatorship as\r\na means of meeting such an emergency; the later constitution had no such\r\nprovision, and the burden of responsibility fell on the joint shoulders\r\nof Senate and magistrates. Whether the exercise of such summary capital\r\njurisdiction was legal depended on the status and sex of the victims. If\r\nthe 170 women put to death for poisoning in 331 B.C.[1340] were executed\r\nby magisterial decree, the act was legal, for women had no right of\r\nappeal. Similar legality attended its exercise over provincials;[1341]\r\nand, if similar sentences were inflicted on Italian allies,[1342] it was\r\na gross violation of treaty obligations, but not of the laws of Rome. The\r\nmale citizen alone might not be put to death in this summary fashion; and\r\nif the Roman members of the great criminal society of the Bacchanalian\r\nguild were executed without appeal,[1343] this was a judicial murder only\r\njustified by the horror excited in the public mind by the blackest crimes\r\nmasquerading under the guise of religion. We still possess a fragmentary\r\ncopy of the decree by which this “conspiracy” was repressed; in it the\r\nSenate thinks that “capital punishment should be inflicted,”[1344] but\r\nthe decree does not by its wording suspend the ordinary laws of appeal.\r\n\r\nThis guardianship of the state against conspiracies (_conjurationes_) may\r\nhave been the precedent for a power, the legality of which, as exercised\r\nby the Senate during the last century of the Republic, was hotly\r\ncontested. This was the power of declaring the existence of a condition\r\nof things which the Greeks would have denominated στάσις, of singling\r\nout a party in the state and its leaders as enemies (_hostes_) to the\r\nRepublic, the latter being professedly represented by the Senate itself\r\nand the magistrates who happened to be friendly to it, and of advising\r\nthe magistrates who were its presidents, above all the magistrates with\r\n_imperium_, and sometimes even the pro-magistrates,[1345] to employ\r\nevery means of summary coercion to ward off the impending danger. The\r\nformula for thus entrusting the guardianship of the community to a clique\r\nof friendly magistrates was expressed in the words “that the consuls,\r\npraetors, and tribunes of the Plebs (with the addition at times of\r\nother officials with the _imperium_) should see that the state took no\r\nharm.”[1346] After the passing of this decree the responsibility of\r\nthe Senate ceases; the magistrates act at their own peril and cannot\r\nagain devolve any responsibility for a judicial murder they may have\r\ncommitted in the execution of their instructions by again consulting the\r\nSenate on the guilt of their victims or on the method of execution to be\r\nemployed.[1347] There were obvious reasons which rendered it impossible\r\nfor this power to be based on any distant precedent; like the power last\r\ndiscussed it was a substitute for the vanished dictatorship, which was\r\nan integral part of the constitution, and subsequently to the decline of\r\nthis office there was no revolution in Rome antecedent to that which was\r\nheld by conservatives to have been inaugurated by the legislation of the\r\nGracchi. But, even apart from the question of precedent, the absurdity of\r\nthe Senate’s claim to be guardian of the Republic is manifested by the\r\nfact that the opposite party in the _stasis_ might more truly represent\r\nthe theory of the constitution, as the Gracchan party did, than the\r\nSenate’s government itself; a broad line separates political opposition,\r\neven with the utmost force to back it, from criminal conspiracy against\r\nsociety, and by the passing of this “ultimate decree” the Senate declared\r\nitself the _author_ of a revolution. The controversy as to right is\r\nhere insoluble: the insolubility depends on the fact that there was no\r\npermanent government at Rome except that of convention and of force.\r\n\r\nYet Roman sentiment would have declared that there were times when the\r\ndecree and its consequences were justified. Force can only be met by\r\nforce, and a gathering such as Catiline’s army in Etruria was a fair\r\nobject of attack by the executive authorities; but sentiment would not\r\nhave allowed the execution without appeal of a few prisoners captured\r\nwithin the city, however grave the danger. A state of war must be\r\nrecognised, but there was no power in the Roman state that could declare\r\nmartial law and execute its consequences.\r\n\r\nThe exercise of this unprecedented power evoked a vigorous protest from\r\nthe true government, the people.[1348] The plebiscite passed by the\r\nyounger Gracchus was aimed more directly at the magistrates, and it\r\nimproved on the Valerian laws by enacting “that no _judicium_ should be\r\nexercised on the _caput_ of a Roman citizen without the consent of the\r\npeople.”[1349] But it is possible that it made senators individually\r\nresponsible for the decree authorising such conduct on the part of the\r\nmagistrates,[1350] and it is almost certain that it abrogated a clause in\r\nthe law of the Twelve Tables by declaring that the Plebs might exercise\r\ncapital jurisdiction against a magistrate guilty of violating the\r\nprovisions of the measure.[1351] Henceforth there could be no question of\r\nthe illegality of the _ultimum senatus consultum_, for Cicero’s quibble\r\nthat the Gracchan law only protected the lives of _cives_, and that\r\nindividuals specified by the Senate had been declared _hostes_,[1352] is\r\nan argument in a circle. It is this latter possibility which the Gracchan\r\nlaw denied; and though common sense might interpret certain overt acts\r\nas a sign of war against society, no degree of treason could _ipso jure_\r\nmake a citizen into an enemy unless that treason had been proved in a\r\ncourt of law.\r\n\r\nMore justifiable than the power which we have just considered was\r\nthe police-control which the Senate exercised in Rome. Here, as in\r\nother matters of administration, its attention was confined to great\r\nand exceptional emergencies. In the absence of all facilities for the\r\nexpression of public opinion in Rome, except through the medium of a\r\nmagistrate, the ancient trade guilds (_collegia artificum_) formed\r\nconvenient centres for electioneering in the democratic interest. The\r\nfact that towards the close of the Republic their weight was thrown\r\ninto the anti-senatorial scale led the government to regard their\r\nexistence as inimical to public order. A decree of the Senate of the\r\nyear 64 B.C. summarily dissolved all but the most venerable guilds\r\nwhich were supposed to derive their origin from Numa;[1353] and this\r\nsudden suppression may be regarded as a last step in a long career of\r\nadministrative interference, no record of which has been preserved by\r\nhistory. Private political clubs, on the other hand, such as were known\r\nby the names of _sodalitates_ and _decuriati_, did not come under the\r\nimmediate cognisance of the magistrate; for their coercion the Senate\r\nhad to procure the passing of a law.[1354] But minor details connected\r\nwith bribery and corruption were within its competence. It infringed the\r\ninviolability of the magistrate’s house by allowing search to be made\r\nthere for incriminating proof of corruption, and it directed that whoever\r\nshould be guilty of harbouring professional election agents (_divisores_)\r\nat his dwelling should be liable to a vote of censure and possible\r\nprosecution.[1355]\r\n\r\nIf we now turn from the corrective to the administrative activity of the\r\nSenate, we shall find that this was exhibited chiefly in the departments\r\nof foreign relations, finance, and religion.\r\n\r\nThe primary spheres of foreign activity are the declaration of war,\r\nthe making of peace, and the framing of alliances. All these powers\r\nbelonged of right to the people, and, as regards the first, there was\r\nnever any question that the Senate’s position was merely that of a\r\nconstant adviser. The two latter powers merge into one another, for a\r\nstate that was not on some terms of alliance with Rome was, according to\r\nthe rude notions of the prevailing international law, an enemy of the\r\nRepublic. There appear at intervals during the Republic signs of a keen\r\nbut advantageous controversy as to whether the right to conclude binding\r\ntreaties in the name of the Republic was possessed by the _imperator_ in\r\nthe field, as well as by Senate and people. To profit by the oath of a\r\ngeneral when it entailed success, to disavow it when it meant failure,\r\nand in this case to hand the unfortunate commander, who had saved Roman\r\nlives but not Roman honour, bound and naked as a scapegoat to the enemy,\r\nwere the convenient results of this condition of juristic doubt. The\r\nCaudine Forks in Samnium, Numantia in Spain, and the neighbourhood of\r\nSuthul in Numidia saw Roman generals and their deluded adversaries equal\r\nvictims of this controversy.[1356] But the opinion finally prevailed\r\nthat without the consent of the Senate and the people no sworn treaty\r\n(_foedus_) could be binding.[1357] The practice as to the division of\r\nthis authority between the council and the assembly varied from time\r\nto time. In the earliest period a treaty of peace seems to be within\r\nthe competence of the magistrate, and therefore of the Senate; in the\r\nconstitution of the middle Republic, as revealed to us by Polybius, such\r\nan agreement is always submitted to the people for ratification,[1358]\r\nbut the close of Republican history shows cases where the Senate alone is\r\nmentioned as the deciding authority.[1359]\r\n\r\nBut the people had at all times merely the final ratifying authority in\r\nthese matters. The diplomatic negotiations that preceded the conclusion\r\nof an agreement with a foreign nation had ever been in the hands of\r\nthe Senate. When envoys approached an _imperator_ in the field, his\r\nduty was to send them on to the consuls and their council; how far he\r\nhimself entered into preliminary negotiations with them depended on his\r\nown discretion, but in the best days of the Republic he could make no\r\ndefinite agreement. The mode in which the Senate received the envoys\r\nfrom a state differed according as the community had already treaty\r\nrelations with Rome, or was in a state of natural war. The permanent\r\nrepresentation of a friendly nation—except through the vague relationship\r\nwith a noble Roman house—was a device as yet unknown; but the concession\r\nwas made to the envoys of such a state of receiving them within the\r\ntown.[1360] The representatives of the enemy, on the other hand, had no\r\nclaim to reception within the walls.[1361] The embarrassment inspired\r\nby the approach of the suspected Eumenes of Pergamus in 166 B.C. caused\r\na passing regulation to be framed that no kings (the “carnivorous\r\nanimals” of Cato) should be received at Rome in person.[1362] Towards\r\nthe close of the Republican period (67 B.C.) a demand for the better\r\nordering of business, as well as the suspicion created by the dealings\r\nof envoys lingering in Rome with the political coteries, caused a law to\r\nbe passed that the month of February should be devoted to the reception\r\nof legations.[1363] As most of the envoys at this time came from states\r\nwithin the Roman sphere of influence, it was an advantage to the\r\nprovincials to have a definite season set apart in which they could air\r\ntheir grievances.\r\n\r\nThe most pressing demand for entering into new relations with states\r\nnaturally accompanied the organisation of a province. For the immediate\r\nattention to this demand the conquering general was competent, although\r\nhe was sometimes assisted by ten commissioners (_legati_) appointed by\r\nthe Senate.[1364] The whole work of organisation, known as the law of\r\nthe province (_lex provinciae_), bore the name of the _imperator_, and\r\nthe _lex Rupilia_ of Sicily, the _lex Pompeia_ of Bithynia, and the law\r\nof Metellus in Crete preserved the memory of individual victors and\r\norganisers. The _lex_ in this case is a charter (_lex data_), not a\r\ncomitial act (_lex rogata_), and when we remember that the organisation\r\nof the provinces took place during the period of senatorial ascendency,\r\nwe are not surprised at the omission of the formality of the consultation\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\nThe assignment of external spheres of rule (_provinciae_) to magistrates\r\nwas one of the most important powers connected with the senatorial\r\nadministration of the provinces. We have already seen how the original\r\ntheory that a magistrate chose his department gave way to senatorial\r\nselection. In spite of the fact that the provinces were not assigned to\r\nspecified individuals, but to holders of certain offices, this right\r\nof bestowal put great patronage in the hands of the Senate; it might\r\nreward or punish consuls or proconsuls by the assignment of more or\r\nless important districts,[1365] and the lot (_sortitio_) by which the\r\nindividual holders were determined was often tampered with.[1366]\r\n\r\nThe final organisation of Italy and the provinces also gave fresh spheres\r\nof influence to the Senate. The free cities, which extended over the\r\nwhole of Italy, and were found as privileged units in the provinces,\r\nwere subject to its controlling power. These had given up all claim to\r\nthe exercise of external authority, and it was the Senate that adjusted\r\nthe conflicting claims of states both within and without the bounds of\r\nItaly.[1367] When the rights of a free city were held, not by treaty, but\r\nby a precarious charter, the Senate might cancel certain grants, which,\r\nby the terms of the charter, were revocable at pleasure.[1368] In the\r\ndetails of provincial government and the relations of the subject cities\r\nto the governor the Senate seems seldom to have interfered directly. But\r\nwe must remember that in every province the governor was accompanied by a\r\nsenatorial committee in the form of a _consilium_ composed of his legates\r\nand of any senator who happened to be in the province.[1369] It was\r\nhis duty to refer every important matter to this council, and the most\r\nimportant questions it bade him reserve for the judgment of the Senate at\r\nhome.[1370]\r\n\r\nThe power of the purse, which has been the guarantee of so many popular\r\nliberties, was not possessed by the people at Rome. By escaping so early\r\nthe incidence of direct taxation they lost a formidable weapon with\r\nwhich they might have fought the Senate. For this reason the admitted\r\nincapacity of the latter body to impose a new tax on the community was no\r\ngreat limitation to its powers after the year 167 B.C., when the Italian\r\n_tributum_ disappeared.[1371] The control of the details of finance,\r\nwhich had never belonged to the people but always to the executive, was\r\nthe mainstay of its power in this department. The circumstance that the\r\ncontrol of estimates had been given to occasional officials, the censors,\r\nand that the details of expenditure had been taken from the hands of the\r\nconsuls and placed in those of the most subordinate of all magistrates,\r\nthe quaestors, sufficiently explains the growth of a central directing\r\nauthority, which may be considered in its three relations to the property\r\nof the state, the estimates, and the expenditure.\r\n\r\nThe chief property of the state in the later Republic was the income\r\nderived from the provinces, and it is obvious that the Senate determined\r\nits amount when it ratified the terms of the _lex provinciae_. But the\r\nolder source of revenue—the public domains of the state—was also subject\r\nto its control. It granted the occupation or the use of public lands\r\nand decreed their alienation by sale or gift.[1372] It also accepted\r\nor rejected gifts and bequests to the state, and the proposal of Ti.\r\nGracchus that the people should deal with the movable property left\r\nby Attalus III., king of Pergamus,[1373] struck at one of the most\r\nundisputed of senatorial prerogatives.\r\n\r\nThe most important estimates of those items of revenue and expenditure\r\nwhich varied from time to time were, as we have seen,[1374] made every\r\nfive years by the censors. But the Senate exercised the right of\r\ndirecting, even of reversing, the arrangements made by these officials;\r\nthe appeal against an oppressive contract was made to them,[1375] and\r\nduring the vacancy in the censorship they designated the magistrates who\r\nwere to preside over new financial assignments.[1376]\r\n\r\nThe control over the treasury, both in the voting of large supplies or in\r\ndetailed expenditure for definite purposes, was complete. The provincial\r\nbudget, comprising the allowances for the different governors, was voted\r\nby the Senate, and this _senatus consultum de provinciis ornandis_[1377]\r\nwas one of its most effective means of controlling the magistracy.\r\nThe special sums voted for military or any other purposes were either\r\ndirectly paid[1378] or credited by the quaestors to the commanders abroad\r\nor to the home officials.[1379] We have already seen that it was only the\r\nconsul who could order the quaestors to pay without a permit from the\r\nSenate;[1380] but, as the consul after the time of Sulla rarely took the\r\nfield, the Senate’s control of expenditure was finally uninterrupted even\r\nby this survival.\r\n\r\nIf we pass from the most material to the most spiritual element in human\r\nlife, we find this also directed to a certain extent by the Senate.\r\nAlthough religion in its various departments was under the control of\r\nspecial guilds, yet these colleges possessed little power of initiative,\r\nand an executive authority was necessary to carry out their will. The\r\nannouncement of prodigies was met by the Senate with forms of expiation\r\nsuggested by the priestly colleges. In the Sibylline books above all\r\nanswers might be discovered whose political was even greater than their\r\nreligious import. When the dangerous annexation of Egypt could be staved\r\noff by a few lines on these mysterious leaves,[1381] it is no wonder\r\nthat their own guardians, the _decemviri_, scarcely dared to unfold them\r\nwithout the authorisation of the Senate. The activity of the _comitia_\r\nwas sometimes hampered by the Senate’s habit of decreeing extraordinary\r\nfestivals (_feriae_),[1382] while the successful general was dependent on\r\nits will for the duration of the thanksgivings (_supplicationes_) which\r\nfollowed his victory.[1383] The reception of a new god into the Roman\r\nPantheon was probably in strict law a popular right,[1384] but it is one\r\nthat seems to have been tacitly conceded to the Senate.[1385]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS OF ROME AND THE INCORPORATION OF ITALY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe peoples of Greece and Italy offer, amidst many general points\r\nof similarity, some striking differences in their conceptions of\r\ninternational relations. The pan-Hellenic sentiment, which created a\r\nshadowy law of nations, has no pan-Italic counterpart. Outside the Greek\r\ncity-state there was but the sentiment of nationality to create rules for\r\nhuman conduct; but, for this very reason, the rules, when created, were\r\nof pan-Hellenic validity. In Italy we get narrower but closer groupings;\r\nits history is the history of leagues, and the inevitable result of this\r\nmore concentrated life was a closeness of international ties between the\r\nfederated members which stood in marked contrast to the vagueness of the\r\nrelations between the isolated groups.\r\n\r\nThe ties of religion and of ethnic affinity, as expressed in an obvious\r\nsimilarity of institutions, were, in Italy as elsewhere, the strongest\r\nconnecting forces between states; but in Italy they were but the first\r\nrude ligaments that gave place to a stronger political bond and that\r\ncrumbled to pieces when the more enduring chain had been forged. The\r\nfestival of the Alban Mount became to the Latins, as the sacred centre of\r\nVolsinii to the Etruscans, but the religious symbol of a lasting league.\r\nBeyond the limits of the league the national and religious sentiment was\r\nweak. There was no Delphi to direct the Italian peoples, and no Olympia\r\nat which they might meet.\r\n\r\nThis isolated grouping of the Italian peoples may have been partly due to\r\nthe great mixture of the populations of Italy south of the Alps and south\r\neven of the Apennines; but the earliest Italian history reveals the fact\r\nthat even the closely-related races of Latins, Umbrians, and Sabellians\r\nwere not connected by much closer ties of an international character\r\nthan those which bound each to the Etruscan, the Iapygian, the Gaul,\r\nand the Greek. It is true that with the progress of time something like\r\nan ethnic sentiment was created in the purely Italian group, with vast\r\nconsequences to the history of the world. After the Umbrian power, which\r\nhad once extended from sea to sea, had been weakened, on the left by\r\nthe Etruscan, on the right by the Celt, Rome becomes the great frontier\r\npower, the bulwark of the group of blood-related nations against the\r\nforeign-speaking Tuscan and the Gaul whose kinship with herself she had\r\nforgotten; but the relation soon became political, and, therefore, more\r\nthan international. That aggregation of vague human sentiments, which is\r\ncalled International Law, was not juristically stronger within the sphere\r\nof the blood-related than it was within the sphere of the Italian group\r\nof peoples.\r\n\r\nWithin this wider sphere of humanity, that was not yet “Italian,”\r\nthere are traces of the observance by Rome of customs relating to the\r\nconduct of war and to negotiations for procuring peace—customs which\r\nby their very existence show that, though the early Roman employed the\r\nsame word to designate the stranger and the enemy, a state of war was\r\nnot considered as the permanent relation even between _hostes_; which\r\nprove, by their elaboration, the antiquity of some sense of international\r\nobligation, and which exhibit, by the constancy with which they were\r\napplied, the existence of reciprocal forms and duties owed by the\r\nhostile state to Rome. The functions of the _Fetiales_, the priestly\r\nambassadors (_oratores_)[1386] who demand reparation, declare war and\r\nratify a peace, seem never to have been confined to those peoples with\r\nwhom Rome had treaty relations, but to have been extended to any nation\r\nwhich had not by specific acts waged war on Rome. Four of the priestly\r\nguild of _Fetiales_ were appointed to seek redress. These elected one\r\nof their number to become their representative, to be for the time the\r\n“ratifying father of the Roman people” (_pater patratus populi Romani_).\r\nAt the borders of the offending tribe the _pater_ with many imprecations\r\ncalled Jupiter to witness that the grievance was established, the\r\ndemand reasonable. Three times did he make the same appeal—to the first\r\nsojourner he met in the stranger’s territory, to the sentinel at the\r\ngate, and to the magistrate within the walls. Thirty days were allowed\r\nfor the reply; on the first of these the standard was hoisted on the\r\ncitadel of Rome, and the burgess army gathered for the threatening war.\r\nIf an appeasing answer were not returned within these days of grace, the\r\n_pater_ again set forth and launched a charred spear (the prehistoric\r\nweapon of hardened wood) into the territory of the offender, with words\r\nsetting forth the menace of war.[1387] When the struggle was over it was\r\nhe who struck the peace and the sacrificial victim with a flint-stone\r\nwhich symbolised the watchful Jupiter (_Jupiter lapis_).[1388] The\r\nsanctity of envoys, other than these priestly messengers, was as\r\nrigorously observed in the Italian as in the Greek world. A violent death\r\non an embassy was a martyrdom deserving of immortality, and the ancient\r\nRostra in the Comitium showed a group of statues erected to those who had\r\nmet their fate in the cause of peace.[1389] The neutrality of ambassadors\r\nwas exacted with equal care, and the disaster of the Allia might be\r\nlooked on as a retribution for the impious precipitancy of the Fabii who,\r\nforgetting their sacred character, fought in the ranks of Clusium against\r\nthe Celtic hordes.[1390]\r\n\r\nIn the agreements made by generals and envoys with a foreign people, the\r\nidea, common to most primitive minds, that it is the oath which makes\r\nthe promise binding is strikingly present. We have already touched on\r\nthe vast constitutional import of this conception in its connexion with\r\nthe question, posed but never completely answered by the too patriotic\r\njurists: “Who could take the oath on behalf of the Roman people?” But\r\nthe theory which on the whole prevailed, that it could not be taken\r\nby a general in the field, not only nullified the promise so made and\r\nrendered it a mere agreement (_sponsio_), valid between citizens but\r\nnot between strangers, but exposed the rash swearer to the extremest\r\npenalties. With a strange inconsistency of judgment it was held that the\r\noath, which was no oath, laid the guilt of perjury on the conscience of\r\nthe people, unless the man who had caused the people unwittingly to\r\nsin was offered up as an atoning sacrifice. Naked and bound, like the\r\nsacrificial human victim of prehistoric times prepared for the altar, the\r\n_imperator_ was surrendered to the offended people. It is not surprising\r\nthat the latter—whether Samnites, Spaniards, or Numidians[1391]—refused\r\nto take the worthless gift from the hands of the _pater patratus_, and\r\npreferred to continue the conflict with a people still convicted of sin.\r\nThe individual oath to return, made by a prisoner of war released on\r\nparole, though binding on his soul alone and, as a religious obligation,\r\nnot punishable by the civil arm, was enforced by the public conscience.\r\nOne—others said more than one—of the Roman captives sent by Hannibal\r\nafter Cannae to negotiate an exchange of prisoners declined to return\r\non the negotiations falling through. The pretext was that they had\r\nrevisited the camp of the conqueror _after_ the oath had been taken.\r\nTradition varied as to the punishment imposed by Rome; some spoke of a\r\nsummary arrest and enforced return to the Phoenician camp, others of a\r\ndegradation by the censor and of a public detestation that drove the\r\nperjurer to suicide.[1392]\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the isolated specimens that have been handed down to\r\nus of rules of international right which Rome thought due to every\r\nnation. But, apart from such universal duties, the Roman mind, with its\r\nsimple dichotomy of the world into enemies (_hostes_)[1393] and friends\r\n(_amici_), recognised varying degrees of obligation as due to either\r\nclass. The _hostes_ were all states or individuals with whom Rome had no\r\ntreaty relations. With these there was no presupposition even of constant\r\ndiplomatic relations, and their absence was symbolised by the manner in\r\nwhich envoys from such states were received. The tradition of “speaking\r\nwith one’s enemy in the gate” was rigorously preserved to the end of the\r\nRepublic, and the Senate had to meet a messenger from the enemy outside\r\nthe walls.[1394] The friends of Rome were those with whom she had any\r\nrelations that approximated to a federative character. There might be no\r\ndefinite treaty, no specified interchange of obligations; but the vague\r\nterm _amicitia_ with kindred titles of affection was applied to the\r\nvaguest association as well as to the closest alliance with Rome; it was\r\nindifferently a symbol of the greatest independence or of the practical\r\nsubjection of the contracting state. The members of the military symmachy\r\nin Italy could share this title with distant Carthage,[1395] and even the\r\nbarbarous Aedui are “kinsmen and brothers” of the Roman people.[1396]\r\nEven in the case of these communities the perpetual representation of\r\nmutual interests by means of permanent ambassadors—an institution still\r\nin its infancy in the seventeenth century of our era—was naturally\r\nunknown; but their recognition as friends granted their envoys or\r\nrepresentatives an entrance and an audience of the Senate within the\r\nwalls.[1397]\r\n\r\nCloser relations between Rome and her “friends” were generally\r\nconditioned by ethnic and their corresponding religious ties. But the\r\nforeign element in early Rome shows that this was not universally the\r\ncase. The rape of the Sabine women in its least significance reveals\r\nthe fact of the close tie of intermarriage between Rome and a non-Latin\r\ncommunity; the first treaty with Carthage reveals commercial relations,\r\nwhich were accompanied by some form of international jurisdiction, with a\r\nPhoenician power.[1398]\r\n\r\nThe first, because the most universal, ties which attract our attention\r\nas based on treaty relations are those of commerce. Commercial treaties\r\nwith the foreigner led, in the very infancy of Roman history, to the\r\ndevelopment both of common courts and of a common code.\r\n\r\nIn the later Republic and in the Empire we have frequent mention of a\r\ncivil court which was believed to have had an international origin.\r\nAttempts have been made to assign to this court of _recuperatores_ a\r\npurely Roman source;[1399] but its essential peculiarities—the large\r\nuneven number of jurors, three or five, when the ordinary civil courts\r\nknew but one; the rapidity and simplicity of the procedure; the _formula_\r\nframed by a magistrate and not taken from the _legis actiones_ of\r\nthe civil law—are best explained as survivals of a time when it was a\r\nmixed court of international jurisdiction.[1400] The two or four jurors\r\nprobably represented the contracting states in equal proportions, the\r\nthird or fifth may have been an arbitrator chosen from another community;\r\nthe magistrate who gave the _formula_ would have been an official of the\r\ntown in which the mixed court sat.\r\n\r\nBut the _formula_ implied a system of legal principles, and these\r\ncould not easily be furnished by the civil law (_jus civile_) of each\r\ncontracting state. It was not Roman pride that prevented the foreigner\r\nfrom participating in her native law; it was the unwillingness of the\r\nforeigner to be made subject to a code characterised by excessive\r\ncumbrousness, by danger and by delay, and the counter-objection of the\r\nRoman to be the victim of similar disadvantages in the contracting state.\r\nNo merchant, to whom time meant money, would adopt the cumbrous form of\r\nconveyance known as the _mancipatio_, when ownership could be acquired\r\nby the simple transfer (_traditio_) known of all nations; none would\r\ncare to repeat a _formula_ (to be learnt only of the Roman pontiff),\r\nthe least error in the utterance of which was sufficient to extinguish\r\nhis claim; and the symbolic acts performed before the praetor, though\r\npossibly dear to the Roman mind, could not have been attractive to the\r\nforeigner. Convenience dictated a compromise, and this was found in the\r\ngradual collection of a body of rights (_jus_) from the customs of “the\r\nworld” (_gentes_) as known to the Romans. This _jus gentium_, or body\r\nof rights possessed by man as a citizen of the world, was a code of\r\nprivate international law, and it cannot be regarded as being even purely\r\nItalian. A nation that borrowed its alphabet from a Chalcidian city, that\r\nimitated the military organisation of the Hellenes, that traded in the\r\nsixth century with Sicily, Sardinia, Libya and Carthage, must have been\r\ndeeply imbued with the customs of the Greek and Phoenician world. Nor was\r\nthis code a growth of Rome’s supremacy, for her commercial preceded her\r\npolitical greatness. Its origin dates back to a time probably anterior\r\nto the Republic, certainly far earlier than the institution of the\r\npraetorship. We have already noticed how for more than a century the\r\nsame civil judge administered both laws, that of the state and that of\r\nthe _gentes_,[1401] and how the _jus civile_ was insensibly modified by\r\ncontact with its younger relative.\r\n\r\nBut closer relations than those of commerce might exist between Rome and\r\nstates connected with her by neighbourhood or kindred. The interchange\r\nof the rights of private law, of ownership and of marriage, which the\r\nGreeks called ἰσοπολιτεία, was a natural out-growth of the Italian\r\ntendency to close political association. Such communion rendered each\r\nmember of the contracting states in private law a _civis_ of the other;\r\nthe _conubium_ carried with it the _patria potestas_ and all the family\r\nrights that flowed from this power; the _commercium_ allowed the citizen\r\nof the contracting state to own Roman land, to convey property by Roman\r\nforms, to make a contract by the ceremonial of the _sponsio_, to inherit\r\nfrom a Roman or to make a Roman his heir, while it gave the citizen of\r\nRome corresponding rights in the alien city. There could be no question\r\nhere of mixed tribunals or of private international law. The courts of\r\neach state were fully competent; if we may judge from the early relations\r\nof Rome with the Latin cities, the place in which the contract had been\r\nconcluded, or, in other words, the forms of the contract, determined the\r\ncompetence of the court.[1402]\r\n\r\nStill more definite bonds of union than these relations of private law\r\n(although often their primary condition) were certain political creations\r\nwhich made the ties between the states something more than international.\r\nIt was a nucleus approaching a federal government which gave the first\r\nimpulse to the extension of Roman power in Italy. Rome, as known to us in\r\nlegend, is never quite a city-state. She is an offshoot of Alba Longa,\r\nthe titular head of the Latin league. Tradition says that her conquest\r\nof her mother city led to her occupying a singular position with respect\r\nto the thirty cities of this league. She was one of the contracting\r\nparties, the cities were the other; she was the equal, not the member,\r\nof the group. The acceptance of this position by the confederate cities\r\nshows their eagerness for the protection of the frontier town; but\r\nthe protectorate became burdensome, a war ensued, and Roman rule was\r\nshaken off only to be reimposed on firmer lines by the strong hand of\r\nthe Etruscan dynasty represented by the Tarquins. Rome now became one\r\nat least of the religious centres of the league, and the Diana of the\r\nAventine symbolised the lasting union of the Latin folk.[1403] The\r\nexpulsion of the kings, while it stripped Rome of territory, shook for\r\na time the allegiance of the league, and it was not until 493 B.C. that\r\nthe old conditions were renewed; for the details that might in historical\r\ntimes be read in the treaty attributed to Sp. Cassius were doubtless but\r\na replica of the old terms of the alliance. Eternal peace was enjoined,\r\nmutual support was to be given in war, and each contracting party was\r\nto share equally in the booty. The supreme command in war was to be\r\nheld now by the Roman general, now by the commander of the confederate\r\nforces.[1404] But the closest bond was that of ἰσοπολιτεία,[1405] the\r\nmutual participation in _commercium_ and doubtless also in _conubium_,\r\nwhich was accompanied by the proviso that the court of the state,\r\nin which the contract had been concluded and the case was therefore\r\ntried, should give speedy satisfaction to the claimant from each\r\ncommunity.[1406] Reciprocity such as this was naturally accompanied by\r\nfreedom in choice of domicile. The Roman settled in the Latin city and\r\nthe Latin in the Roman retained the private rights of both communities.\r\nIt is doubtful whether at this period the transference of residence was\r\naccompanied by a share in the voting rights of the state in which the\r\nimmigrant sojourned.[1407]\r\n\r\nTo this association a third factor was soon added in the Hernican\r\nleague.[1408] The extension of the confederation beyond its ethnic limits\r\nwas a grand strategic move; for by the inclusion of the Hernici, Rome now\r\npresented a compact chain of fortresses against her enemies of the east\r\nand south, the Aequi and the Volsci. Their military importance explains\r\nwhy the newly admitted members were raised to the level of the older\r\nallies. They boasted the same reciprocity of private rights with Rome,\r\nthey shared in a third part of the spoils of war, and they joined with\r\nRomans and Latins in the work of common colonisation.\r\n\r\nThis colonisation was at once a military and social measure, and the\r\nmeans by which the league extended its geographical and political limits.\r\nThe custom of war, which permitted the Italian tribes to annex a third\r\nof all conquered land, had ever been used as a means of expansion by the\r\npowerful league. And this expansion was a very real one; for the Latin\r\ncolonies (_coloniae Latinae_), as they were called, were full members\r\nof the society that gave them birth. Such towns as Suessa Pometia,\r\nCora, and Velitrae had been military outposts in the territory of the\r\nVolsci; and now the Volscian, the Rutulian, and even the Etruscan were\r\noppressed with the weight of new foundations by the three great powers.\r\nBut the year 384 seems to mark a strange and unaccountable break in the\r\nhistory of this extension. Of all the Latin colonies founded after that\r\ndate, but one is mentioned as a member of the confederacy—a circumstance\r\nwhich has led to the conclusion that Rome (whether with or without the\r\nconsent of the other members) had cut off all future joint foundations\r\nfrom the religious and federal privileges of the league. Otherwise\r\nthe consequences of this exclusion were not great; the new towns were\r\nmilitary allies of the league, not of Rome, and their citizens still\r\npossessed those private rights which always remained of the essence of\r\n_latinitas_. Forty-seven cities—partly old Latin towns, partly Latin\r\ncolonies earlier than 384—still participated in the Latin festival;\r\nthat within this circle a distinction was drawn between thirty voting\r\nand seventeen not-voting members is an insecure conclusion based on\r\nthe attempts of the annalists to reconstruct the traditional number of\r\nthirty Latin cities; there may still have been thirty votes, but these\r\nmay well have been distributed in some way over the forty-seven cities\r\nof the league. That the closing of the Latin confederacy was due mainly\r\nto Roman pressure is perhaps shown by the series of dangerous revolts\r\namongst its cities, which often sided with their ancient enemies the\r\nVolsci. The Hernicans were as eager to shake off the yoke; but Rome\r\nemerged from both crises with her power strengthened and her commonwealth\r\nenlarged. The latter result was due to a renewed employment of her old\r\ndevice of absorption. Tusculum in 381, and Satricum not long afterwards,\r\nhad their commonwealths destroyed, and were forced, as a penal measure,\r\nto accept the full or partial Roman citizenship.[1409] At the close of\r\nthe struggle in 358 the leagues were renewed and the relations of Rome\r\nwith the two groups of states remodelled, probably on harder terms. In\r\nthe Samnite war which followed, the Latin cities first clung to Rome,\r\nfor they preferred a native to a Sabellian hegemony; but Rome’s rapid\r\nconclusion of a treaty of peace and alliance with the Samnites, which\r\nthe league was asked to accept and not to ratify, was taken as the final\r\nproof of actual subjection concealed under the name of a hegemony. The\r\nLatins made their last demands; they gave up their position as a military\r\nconfederacy, but they did not wish to be absorbed into the body politic\r\nof Rome. They asked for the golden mean—a system of federal government,\r\nbut one that should still preserve the fundamental distinction between\r\nRome and the confederate cities. One of the consuls was to be a Roman,\r\nthe other a Latin, and half the Senate was to be chosen from Latium. But\r\nthe civic feeling was too strong at Rome; she would not herself surrender\r\nthe communal constitution which she had so often wrested from others;\r\nshe rejected the alternative which would have paralysed her power as a\r\nconquering state and made of her but a federal capital. Her “No!” to the\r\nLatins was one of the turning-points in the history of Italy and of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe battles of Veseris and Trifanum gave her the victory, but she was\r\nsorely puzzled as to the use to be made of it. The league was to be\r\nbroken up, its members isolated, and this work of disintegration was\r\ncarried through with thoroughness; not only were the federal assemblies\r\n(_concilia_) abolished, but no right of intermarriage or of commercial\r\nintercourse (_jus conubii et commercii_) was permitted between the\r\ncities.[1410] But how to deal with the individual communities was a\r\nfar harder problem. The incorporation which had been the punishment of\r\nisolated revolt could not be applied to the _disjecta membra_ of a whole\r\nleague, for it would have changed the city-state into a nation. Hence\r\nthe plan adopted was a compromise between the old policy of absorption\r\nand a new principle—that of alliance. Aricia, Pedum, and Lanuvium\r\nlost their independence and received the full Roman franchise; while\r\nTibur, Praeneste, Lavinium were compelled to conclude separate treaties\r\n(_foedera_) with Rome, and formed the nucleus of the ever-growing class\r\nof _civitates foederatae_. Thirty years later (306 B.C.) a similar fate\r\nbefell the remaining league of the Hernici. Their loyalty had not stood\r\nthe test of the second Samnite war; but there were degrees of guilt\r\namongst the cities. Anagnia, the chief centre of the revolt, and other\r\nincriminated towns, were given merely the private rights of citizenship;\r\nthe full citizenship was indeed offered to the three loyal towns of\r\nAletrium, Ferentinum, and Verulae, but, on their expressing a preference\r\nfor their own local constitutions and codes, they were permitted to\r\nretain an autonomy guaranteed by separate treaties.[1411] The break up\r\nof the Hernican league was only an incident in a triumphant career of\r\nconquest that was never followed by annexation. The Samnite wars and\r\nthe struggle with Pyrrhus had ended in the acknowledgment of Rome’s\r\nsupremacy by every nation south of the Macra and the Rubicon. The three\r\ncivilisations of Greece, Tuscany, and Italy furnished her indifferently\r\nwith allies; the town and the tribal union were alike represented in her\r\nsymmachy. Tibur and Praeneste in Latium, Aletrium and Ferentinum amongst\r\nthe Hernici, Volaterrae and Clusium in Etruria, Iguvium in Umbria, the\r\nPicentes, Marsi, and Peligni amongst the Sabellians, and Greek cities\r\nlike Neapolis in Campania or Rhegium amongst the Bruttii, are types of\r\nthe states and peoples that she numbered amongst her _socii_.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this unification, and of the tendencies which had preceded\r\nit, was to divide the inhabitants of Italy into two broad classes—those\r\nof citizens (_cives_) and those of allies (_socii_) of Rome. The first\r\nclass (far the smaller numerically) represented the earlier effort at\r\nincorporation; the second was the consequence of the later policy\r\nwhich founded a military league. Minuter distinctions of rights, which\r\nnecessitate cross-divisions in the classification of the states,\r\nsometimes obscure this fundamental analysis; but it was never lost sight\r\nof and was the guiding light to the Roman lawyer, as it is to us, in his\r\npath through the labyrinth of the complex organisation of Italy.\r\n\r\nThe _cives_ of Rome bear this name either in a full or a partial sense;\r\nthey may be citizens with voting rights or citizens in private law alone\r\n(_cives sine suffragio_). If we fix our attention on the first of these\r\nclasses, we find that historically there were two modes in which the\r\n_civitas_ was gained by a commune outside the city. It might be due\r\nto the incorporation of an already existing state, or it might be the\r\nconsequence of the planting of a Roman colony. The merging of some of\r\nthe Latin communities in Rome[1412] has already furnished instances of\r\nthe former mode of conferment; the Roman colonies which illustrate the\r\nsecond (_coloniae civium Romanorum_) were outlying fragments of the\r\nPopulus, planted as a defensive garrison on the third of the conquered\r\nland, which was the legitimate spoil of the invader. A social was from\r\nthe first combined with the military object; but the enforced exodus of\r\nportions of the burgess body on some occasions[1413] proves that, in this\r\nform of colonisation, the interest of the state came before that of the\r\nindividual. It was, in fact, a military levy ordained by law, although\r\nvoluntary profession usually took the place of the compulsory summons of\r\nthe regular _dilectus_. In military array, with standards flying,[1414]\r\nthe squadron marched to the appointed place under the leadership of the\r\ncommissioners appointed by the people. When a new town was to be founded,\r\nor an old one reconstituted, it was done with the imposing ceremonies\r\nthat marked the birth and enlargement of Rome. After the will of the gods\r\nhad been tested and happy omens gained, the commissioners, with veiled\r\nheads and loins girt up, guided a plough, to which were yoked an ox and a\r\ncow. They thus drew the _pomerium_ of the state, only staying the furrow\r\nwhere the gates of the city were to be.[1415] The greater number of these\r\nsettlements of Roman citizens were for the protection of the Italian\r\ncoasts, and the members of the maritime colonies (_coloniae maritimae_)\r\nwere allowed exemption from active military service.[1416] Few in numbers\r\n(often but a handful of 300 men), and settled in an already existing\r\npolitical society, the colonists formed a privileged patriciate amongst\r\nits older members. The town-council, and such subordinate magistrates as\r\nRome allowed them to possess, were probably chosen from the new settlers\r\nalone; but, as the autonomy which they enjoyed was not great, as they\r\npossessed no high judicial magistrates of their own, and as their voting\r\npower at Rome was more a potential than an actual right, they differed\r\nlittle from the native inhabitants, who as _cives sine suffragio_\r\ncame equally under the jurisdiction of the Roman courts and their\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\nWhether the commune of Roman citizens had had a natural or artificial\r\ngrowth, it was never in early times a true state (_civitas_). Roman law\r\nknew of ἰσοπολιτεία, but not of the closer bond of συμπολιτεία; and\r\nthe principle that no Roman citizen could be a full member of another\r\nstate, although in the later Republic it had given place to the theory\r\nof the municipal independence of the _civis_ was always maintained in\r\ninternational relations with states of the outer world.[1417] As the\r\nnegation of state life implied the negation of communal independence,\r\nwe are not surprised to find that none of these communities of Roman\r\ncitizens possessed a true civic organisation of its own. We cannot\r\ndefine the rights of their town-councils, we cannot assert the absolute\r\nnon-existence of popular gatherings for certain purposes; but the absence\r\nof the _imperium_ and of a true judicial magistracy is clearly discerned.\r\nThese communes fell under the immediate civil jurisdiction, originally\r\nof the consuls, later of the _praetor urbanus_. Originally it may have\r\nbeen necessary for every case not settled by voluntary arbitration\r\nto be brought to Rome, but the distance of some of these towns from\r\nthe capital would have soon rendered this principle of jurisdiction\r\nimpossible. The modern solution, that the judge should go on circuit,\r\ncould not be thought of in a state where the bench consisted of a single\r\nman, and where this individual was prohibited by law from leaving the\r\ncity for more than ten days during his year of office.[1418] The only\r\nalternative was furnished by the favourite Roman device of delegation.\r\nThe praetor nominated praefects for jurisdiction (_praefecti juri\r\ndicundo_), and these were sent, sometimes as standing magistrates,\r\nsometimes perhaps as mere circuit judges, through the Roman towns, which\r\nwere thence known as _praefecturae_.[1419] Delegation implies either a\r\ndivision of competence or, in the case of the lower court possessing full\r\njurisdiction, an appeal to the delegating authority. There is no trace\r\nof the latter practice at Rome, and a systematic division of authority,\r\nalthough motives of convenience may sometimes have led the praetor to\r\npermit it, is inconsistent with the Roman idea of jurisdiction flowing\r\ndirect from the _imperium_. Possibly the praetor permitted the praefect\r\nto regulate almost every kind of contentious jurisdiction, subject to\r\nhis own right of summoning any case he pleased from the delegate to\r\nRome. By a legal fiction the courts of the _praefecturae_ were held\r\nto be within the praetor’s sphere of competence, i.e. within a single\r\nmilestone of the city; they were, to use the technical Roman expression,\r\n_judicia legitima_. No trace whatever has been preserved of the criminal\r\nprocedure applied to such communities. The fact that the praefect was\r\nthe delegate of a civil magistrate would not prove that he was incapable\r\nof exercising criminal jurisdiction, for _jurisdictio_ of every kind is\r\nlatent in the praetor’s _imperium_. All higher jurisdiction was reserved\r\nfor the people; but there was only one _populus Romanus_, that of the\r\ncity of Rome. Hence when the citizen of Ostia or Tusculum was accused of\r\nan offence, the penalty for which demanded a popular sanction, we may\r\nassume that he could either make the appeal, through a fiction like that\r\nunderlying the civil jurisdiction, in spite of his local separation from\r\nRome, or that he stepped, or was brought within, the first milestone of\r\nthe city, the limit inside which the _provocatio_ could legally be made.\r\n\r\nThe second type of _cives_ are those without the right of suffrage (_sine\r\nsuffragio_). There can be little question that the idea of this _status_\r\nwas derived from Rome’s relations with the cities of the Latin league; in\r\nher process of absorption, however, she conferred it on towns to which\r\nshe did not grant the other typically Latin rights; in this way she\r\nmade of it an independent _status_. The Etruscan town of Caere is said\r\nto have won this right in 353 as a gift for good service to Rome. After\r\nthe dissolution of the Latin league in 338 B.C. a group of Campanian\r\ntownships, Capua, Cumae, Atella, and Calatia, were with (the then Latin)\r\nFundi and Formiae brought into this relation with the now dominant city\r\nof Latium;[1420] others nearer home, such as Arpinum of the Volsci, were\r\nsimilarly rewarded or absorbed (303 B.C.),[1421] while the _status_ was\r\nimposed as a means of degrading and reducing to impotence rebellious\r\ntownships such as Anagnia, the leading city of the Hernici.[1422] The\r\nmotive of the conferment, although it might make a difference to the\r\nrights of the towns, produced none in the relations of their respective\r\n_cives_ to Rome.\r\n\r\nThe _civis sine suffragio_ was known as a _municeps_, and the state, all\r\nof whose full members enjoyed this _status_, derived from its occupants\r\nthe name of _municipium_. The name of this type of citizen—the “taker up\r\nof burdens”—aptly expresses his subjection to the chief duties (_munera_)\r\nof Roman citizenship, such as service in the Roman legions, forced\r\nlabour in raising defences, the payment of the war-tax (_tributum_),\r\nand his exclusion from the usually corresponding rights of suffrage and\r\nof office;[1423] it emphasises the fact, strange to the early Roman\r\nmind, of public duties not balanced by public rights, but it contains\r\nno implication of the strangest characteristic of the _municeps_—one\r\nalmost unknown in ancient legal systems—the possession of a personality\r\nin private which is not the result of a personality in public law.\r\nThe _municeps_ possesses _commercium_ with all its consequences; he\r\npossesses _conubium_ with Rome; he is, from the point of view of private\r\nlaw, in every sense a citizen.\r\n\r\nThis possession of citizenship carried with it as a necessary\r\nconsequence his subjection to the praetor’s court. His home, the\r\n_municipium_, is therefore, equally with the community of full Roman\r\ncitizens, a _praefectura_, and the rules of jurisdiction were the\r\nsame in both classes of states. To the praefects nominated by the\r\npraetor were in course of time added others elected by the _comitia\r\ntributa_, and reckoned amongst the minor magistrates known as the\r\n_viginti-sex-viri_.[1424] These latter were the four praefects of Capua,\r\nCumae, and the Campanian coast; but, in regard to the mode of election,\r\nthere is no difference discernible between the judicial magistrates of\r\nthe _municipia_ and those of the communities of Roman citizens. Elected\r\npraefects visited the _municipium_ of Capua and the Roman colony of\r\nPuteoli, while nominated praefects held their court in the colony of\r\nSaturnia and the municipal town of Anagnia.[1425]\r\n\r\nBut the praefect was far from representing the higher functions of\r\ngovernment in every _municipium_. These towns fall into two broad\r\ndivisions, not according to the rights which they receive, but according\r\nto the rights which they retain. The _civitas sine suffragio_ might\r\nbe granted _honoris causa_ to a state which maintained its complete\r\nindependence or its communal autonomy. It was thus conferred on Capua,\r\nCumae, Formiae, and Fundi,[1426] and the gift of the partial citizenship\r\nunder these conditions was a valued privilege. It enabled a Capuan to own\r\nRoman land, to settle on the _ager publicus_, to marry into the noble\r\nhouses of Rome, and to serve, not in the auxiliary cohort, but in her\r\narmy or in the legion raised from the _municipes_. But meanwhile his own\r\nmagistrate, the _meddix tuticus_, administers in the Campanian courts\r\nthe native Sabellian law,[1427] his senate deliberates, and his popular\r\nassembly decides. Sometimes, as in the case of Capua, the state is still\r\nbound by treaty relations to Rome, and the two conflicting principles of\r\narmed alliance and of absorption are for once commingled.[1428]\r\n\r\nYet, in spite of their independence, there is every reason to believe\r\nthat the inevitable praefects visited these states. We must assume, at\r\nleast in the cases where autonomy reached the grade which is visible\r\nin Capua, that a dual system of law prevailed in these communities;\r\nthe court and the procedure would follow the form of contract, whether\r\nSabellian or Roman, and the parties might appear indifferently before\r\nthe Capuan _meddix_ or the Roman praefect. In other cases, where a large\r\nmeasure of administrative autonomy is visible, but where no magistrate\r\nwith a higher rank than that of aedile is found within the state,[1429]\r\nit is possible that Roman law alone prevailed and that the Roman praefect\r\nwas the only judge.\r\n\r\nThe lower class of _municipia_ was represented by states “whose whole\r\ncommonwealth had been merged in that of Rome.”[1430] Of this class\r\nAnagnia, the degraded town of the Hernici, was a type.[1431] Stripped of\r\nall the active rights of citizenship, and under the direct government of\r\na Roman praefect, the members of such towns possessed no personality in\r\npublic law at all. Their position was that of the free Plebeians previous\r\nto their admission to the _suffragium_ and the _honores_.\r\n\r\nThe second principle in Rome’s Italian policy, first projected after the\r\nclose of the Latin war and carried to its completion after the struggle\r\nwith Pyrrhus, resulted in a great military hegemony over states, whose\r\ntreaty relations enabled them to call themselves the “allies” (_socii_)\r\nof Rome. Collective names were soon devised to indicate the closeness of\r\nthe union thus formed; at first the confederates were “wearers of the\r\ntoga” (_togati_), a name that applied equally to the Latin, Sabellian,\r\nand Etruscan. But the introduction of the Greek _pallium_ into the league\r\ndestroyed this basis of classification; and the later term _Italici_ was\r\nevolved, a word whose geographical signification emphasises the idea of a\r\nterritorial limit to certain rights—one which, as we shall see, was not\r\nrigorously preserved, but which marks the distinction, valid alike for\r\nthe Republic and the Principate, between Italy as the privileged and the\r\nprovinces as the unprivileged world.\r\n\r\nThe condition of a conquered town, whether in Italy or the provinces,\r\nbefore its alliance with Rome, is described by the word _deditio_, a term\r\nwhich implies absolute surrender to the power (_ditio_, _potestas_)[1432]\r\nor to the honour (_fides_)[1433] of the Roman people, the two latter\r\nexpressions being to the Roman mind legally equivalent.[1434] Such\r\na _dediticia civitas_ is in the negative condition of an absolute\r\nsuspension of rights, and remains in this case until some are given back\r\nby Rome with a guarantee of their permanence. _Deditio_ is, therefore,\r\na temporary _status_, although it might be occasionally prolonged as a\r\npenal measure, as it was in the case of the revolted Bruttii after the\r\nHannibalic war.[1435] In Italy, as a rule, the terms that Rome dictated\r\nwere those of a military alliance, the conditions for membership of this\r\nbeing, firstly, external sovereignty (_libertas_), as conditioned by the\r\nterms and objects of the league;[1436] secondly, internal independence—a\r\ncondition which the Greek cities called αὐτονομία, and which, in a\r\nLatin charter to a provincial town, appears in the form of the permit\r\n_suis legibus uti_;[1437] thirdly, a basis for these rights, as also\r\nfor the obligations which these states owed to Rome. In dealings, with\r\nthe extra-Italian world this basis was either a charter (_lex data_),\r\ngiven by the Roman people and revocable by them, or a treaty (_foedus_),\r\nequally sanctioned by the people but irrevocable, as being sworn to by\r\nthe two contracting parties; its revocation could only be the consequence\r\nof a genuine _casus belli_. In the first case the state is a _libera\r\ncivitas_, in the second a _libera et foederata civitas_,[1438] or, in its\r\nmore general and briefer designation, a _foederata civitas_.[1439] In\r\nItaly positive evidence furnishes us only with the _foederatae_, but the\r\nexistence of the _liberae civitates_ must be assumed, since, immediately\r\non the beginning of provincial organisation in Sicily, this _status_ is\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nIn Italy also there was doubtless the distinction between the higher and\r\nthe lower kind of _foedus_—the _foedus aequum_ and the _foedus iniquum_.\r\nIn all treaties concluded between Rome and cities in her symmachy there\r\nwas a recognition of partial dependence in the latter; but some of these\r\ntreaties contained a “suzerainty” clause to the effect that the state\r\nin question should “in a friendly spirit respect the majesty of the\r\nRoman people.” This clause did not diminish the _libertas_ of the state\r\naccepting it, but merely strengthened the position of Rome.[1440] It was\r\na characteristic of the _iniquum foedus_.[1441]\r\n\r\nThe duties of the federate cities expressed in their name (_socii_,\r\nσύμμαχοι) were primarily the furnishing of requisitions whether in men\r\nor ships. The latter were demanded from the Greek cities of the coast,\r\nbut Italy as a whole furnished the auxiliary land armies of Rome, the\r\n_togati_ liable to the levy.[1442] Every state had to keep a register\r\nof its effective strength in accordance with a principle of assessment\r\n(_formula_).[1443] The general demands of Rome were specified in the\r\ntreaties; the special levies required at any given time were dictated by\r\nthe Senate and consuls.[1444]\r\n\r\nMilitary requisitions necessarily involve pecuniary burdens. But these\r\nwere all indirect. Each city had complete control of its own finances; no\r\ntribute was imposed by Rome, and the antithesis to the _socius_ is the\r\n_stipendiarius_.[1445] This immunity was originally based on the theory\r\nof treaty relations; later, when the view had grown up that the tribute\r\npaid by the stipendiary states was the result of their precarious tenure\r\nas _possessores_, the Italians were held to be owners of their land. The\r\n_jus Italicum_ of the Principate confers on any state to which it is\r\ngranted quiritarian ownership, and, therefore, immunity from taxation on\r\nland.\r\n\r\nEnjoyment of their own laws and control of their own courts were other\r\nsymbols of the autonomy of the allies. Rome could not legislate for the\r\nItalian _socii_, and they were beyond the judicial authority of the Roman\r\nmagistrate in Italy.\r\n\r\nBut the necessities of social and commercial intercourse rendered it\r\nadvisable that the Italian allies—more especially the Latins—should be\r\nbrought into close legal relations with Rome, and the acceptance by\r\nthe latter of innumerable civil laws of the central state is attested\r\nby Cicero.[1446] The Italians are known to have been bound by a\r\n_plebiscitum_ concerning loans[1447]—this, however, only made contracts\r\nof a certain kind between them and Romans invalid, and may not have\r\ndemanded their consent; but their formal acceptance must have been\r\nrequired for the Didian law, which extended the sumptuary regulations of\r\nthe _lex Fannia_ to all the _Italici_.[1448] The “free” as well as the\r\n“federate” city has the right to accept or decline a legislative proposal\r\nput before it by the Roman government.[1449]\r\n\r\nClosest of all to Rome were the Latins. As members of federate cities\r\nthey were amongst the _socii_,[1450] and it is only as a class with\r\nspecial privileges that they are distinguished from the latter.[1451]\r\n_Latinitas_ had, through the efforts of colonisation, long lost its\r\ngeographical and ethnic significance. It was the name for a _status_\r\noften accepted by Roman citizens, which combined the anomalies of\r\nsovereignty and a partial Roman citizenship. The sovereign rights are\r\nthose possessed by the _socii_, the civic privileges were originally\r\nthose held by the _municipia_; but it is possible that on and after\r\nthe foundation of Ariminum and the last twelve Latin colonies[1452]\r\n_commercium_ alone was granted, _conubium_ refused.[1453] The\r\nmost distinctive privilege of the Latin had been the concession of\r\nfacilities for acquiring Roman political rights. A Latin who migrated\r\nfrom his town and became a domiciled immigrant (_incola_) of Rome had\r\nretained his civic rights in private law, and gained a limited power\r\nof suffrage.[1454] He could even by complete expatriation (_exilium_)\r\nsurrender his own _civitas_ and attain the full Roman citizenship.\r\nBut the conditions subsequently imposed on this right[1455] were\r\nevaded, immigration continued unchecked, and there was a danger of the\r\ndepopulation of the districts from which the exiles came. This evil\r\nsuggested the later method, which gave the Latins admission to the\r\n_civitas_. The holder of a magistracy in his native town was, by the mere\r\nfact of his position, to become a full citizen of Rome. It is improbable\r\nthat this right replaced the right of exile possessed by already\r\nexisting Latin towns, and the date of its origin is unknown; but it\r\npossibly accompanied the remodelling of Latin rights in 268 B.C., and is\r\nhenceforth the typical privilege of the Latin colony.[1456] Another mode\r\nin which the individual Latin could acquire the Roman _civitas_ was by\r\nconducting a successful prosecution under the Acilian and Servilian laws\r\nof extortion.[1457]\r\n\r\nThe freedom of the cities, whether Latin or Italian, seems to have won\r\nrigid respect from Rome and her magistrates. The burdens of military\r\nservice were, indeed, unevenly distributed between the central city and\r\nher allies,[1458] while the spoils of war were mainly for the Roman. But\r\nit was a shock and a surprise when in 173 B.C. a consul made personal\r\nrequisitions on the federate city of Praeneste.[1459] The lesson once\r\nlearnt was only too faithfully followed, and the illegal demands of Roman\r\nofficials were accompanied by acts of capricious violence.[1460] But\r\nthe burden of service and the misuse of power were not the only motives\r\nurging the allies to seek the _civitas_ of Rome; nor was it merely a\r\nsentimental desire to be invested with the Roman name. The citizenship\r\nhad a positive value both as a protection and a source of gain. The\r\nprotection against capital or corporal penalties tacitly accorded to\r\nRomans by provincial governors could not be claimed by the allies, and,\r\nalthough there is no evidence that Rome, in her final organisation\r\nof the Italian confederacy, continued her early policy of inhibiting\r\n_commercium_ between the towns, yet citizenship had a commercial value.\r\nOwnership of land in the provinces was protected by the praetor and the\r\nproconsul, but only when it was held by a Roman. To the Roman trade with\r\nthe barbarian was secure, to the Italian precarious; and everywhere\r\nhe had to face the competition of the commercial companies of Roman\r\nknights. The grounds of interest coincided with those of sentiment\r\nin producing a demand which the progressive party amongst the Romans\r\nstrove to meet. The first attempt was made through a law of the consul\r\nFlaccus in 125 B.C.,[1461] the second by one of C. Gracchus in 121, the\r\nlatter law probably offering citizen rights to the Latins and Latin\r\nrights to the other allies.[1462] The final proposal of Livius Drusus\r\nin 91 was probably an unmodified extension of the _civitas_,[1463] and\r\nit was the failure of this measure that led to the Italian revolt.\r\nA new suggestion for a solution of the problem of the relations of\r\nRome to Italy sprang from the organisation of the hostile states. A\r\nfederal capital, Corfinium, now Italica, was created, and a provisional\r\nfederation of eight states formed, one which was intended ultimately\r\nto embrace the whole of Italy. The Roman, or rather Italian, pattern\r\nwas followed in the new constitution; it possessed two consuls, twelve\r\npraetors, and a senate of five hundred;[1464] but both the magistracies\r\nand the senate were of a federal type. The issue of the war was to\r\ndetermine whether Rome should remain the leading state or become a mere\r\nmember of an Italian confederation, although the unlikelihood of the\r\ngiant city’s settling down to this position may have appealed to some\r\nof the federal leaders.[1465] Unless a redistribution of territory and\r\npopulation had been effected, Rome would have been the Thebes of the\r\nleague, and the fate of the Empire would have been in suspense, for a\r\nfederal government’s capacity for imperial rule had yet to be tested.\r\nBy timely concessions Rome saved her position as the head of the\r\nconfederacy. By the _lex Julia_ (90 B.C.) all the Italian states that\r\nhad not revolted were offered the _civitas_,[1466] and this was followed\r\nby the _lex Plautia Papiria_ (89 B.C.), which offered the _civitas_ to\r\nthe _socii_ and _incolae_ of the allied cities in revolt.[1467] These\r\nmeasures effected a considerable extension of the citizenship, but\r\nother means, of which we are ignorant, must have been adopted for the\r\ngradual incorporation of communities, many of which still remained for a\r\nconsiderable time in rebellion against Rome.[1468]\r\n\r\nThe work of incorporation immediately raised two problems. The first\r\nwas the question of the voting rights of the new citizens. These rights\r\nwere at first grudgingly accorded to prevent the new citizens swamping\r\nthe old. The _novi cives_ were enrolled in but eight of the existing\r\ntribes.[1469] But this compromise could not last long; redistribution\r\nbecame a party cry, and even the conservatives felt the damage done to\r\ntheir cause by a prolonged opposition to the Italian vote. The measure\r\nof Sulpicius (88 B.C.), which distributed the new citizens over all\r\nthe tribes, was indeed repealed with his other laws; but its principle\r\nseems to have been adopted in a decree of the Senate of 84 B.C.,[1470]\r\nand the equality of the Roman and Italian vote was henceforth never\r\nquestioned. The vote itself was not of the importance anticipated. It\r\nwas, in the first place, rendered ineffective through lack of a system\r\nof representation. Even had such a system, planned on a small scale by\r\nAugustus,[1471] been realised, it is questionable whether it could have\r\nsaved the Republic. The Empire had to be garrisoned by professional\r\narmies, and these could not be found in Italy. The military and the civil\r\npower would in any case have been opposed, and the conflict must have\r\nended in a victory for the former. But, so far as the extension of the\r\n_civitas_ did affect future politics, it was only to create a dualism\r\nbetween the Roman proletariate and the Italian country voters. They\r\nhad different ideals and different leaders. But the former were on the\r\nspot, ready for any legislative work, and in the troubled politics that\r\nushered in the monarchy it was they who supported those champions of\r\nfreedom who replaced senatorial rule by a military despotism. The ideal\r\nof the Italian was quiescence; the scattered voters with no corporate\r\norganisation were more prone to look to persons than to causes; sometimes\r\nthere was a wave of municipal enthusiasm, but many an Italian township\r\nrecognised no leader but its Roman patron, and saw in his success at the\r\npolls the highest use to which they could put their suffrage.\r\n\r\nThe second great problem was that of the future administrative relations\r\nof Rome to these incorporated townships. The growth of the municipal\r\nidea was not a new one. Even as early as the beginning of the second\r\ncentury B.C. the possibility had been demonstrated of combining active\r\ninternal independence with the possession of the full Roman _civitas_.\r\nArpinum had received the full citizenship in 188 B.C., and its citizens\r\nvote henceforward in the Cornelian tribe;[1472] but its internal autonomy\r\nwas not destroyed, for the town was still legislating for itself in 115\r\nB.C.[1473] Meanwhile there are signs that a higher type of organisation\r\nwas being given to Roman colonies; at least duovirs, who may be _duoviri\r\njuri dicundo_, are found at Puteoli in 105 B.C.[1474] This idea of some\r\npolitical and judicial independence being enjoyed by townships, which had\r\nbecome a part of Rome, was worked out on the grandest scale after the\r\nsocial war; but the turbulent times which followed were not suited to\r\ncomprehensive municipal legislation, and it is not likely that a definite\r\nsystem, which adjusted local to central powers, was developed before\r\nthe Augustan period. Something had however been done in Cicero’s time.\r\nHere and there we find a local constitution remodelled,[1475] and there\r\nis evidence that there was already some division of competence between\r\nthe local magistrate and the _praetor urbanus_ in civil jurisdiction—the\r\ndefendant being in some cases compelled to give bail (_vadimonium_) to\r\nbring his case to Rome.[1476] This principle of a limitation of the\r\npower of the local courts is found fully developed in a _lex Rubria_\r\nwhich deals with the organisation of Cisalpine Gaul. This district had\r\nheld an anomalous position from the time of the social war. Although\r\nstill a province, its towns had been given Latin rights in 89 B.C.[1477]\r\nThis was interpreted by the democratic party as a forecast of the\r\ncitizenship, for Gallia Cisalpina was certainly enrolled in Rome by the\r\nrevolutionary government of Cinna or his successors.[1478] The grant,\r\nhowever, was not approved at the Sullan restoration, and its validity\r\nwas disputed until Caesar renewed the gift in 49 or 48 B.C.[1479] Two\r\nor three years earlier he had busied himself with the creation of\r\nan Italian organisation in the Gallic towns;[1480] but, even after\r\nhis conferment of the citizenship, the incorporation of the district\r\ninto Italy was not immediately accomplished. It remained technically\r\na province until 42 B.C., when Octavianus gained the consent of the\r\nSenate to its “autonomy,”[1481] i.e. to its recognition as a group of\r\nItalian townships. It is doubtful whether the _lex Rubria_ belongs to\r\nthe epoch of the Julian or the Augustan organisation;[1482] but it\r\nis practically certain that it extends an already existing Italian\r\nsystem to the new district. The chief characteristic of the system is a\r\ndivision of power between the praetor at Rome and the magistrate in the\r\nmunicipal town. In the fragment of the law which we possess this division\r\nis manifested in two particulars. The right of declaring bankruptcy\r\n(_missio in possessionem_) is reserved for the praetor, although the\r\nprovisional arrest of the debtor (_duci jubere_) may be ordered by the\r\nlocal magistrate. Again, in the action for the recovery of a loan and in\r\nthose arising from some other obligations, all cases involving a sum\r\nover 15,000 sesterces must be remitted to Rome, the local magistrate\r\nhaving the right to enforce on the parties bail (_vadimonium_) for\r\ntheir appearance there.[1483] These fragmentary notices are an index\r\nto a principle which was doubtless fully elaborated in the Augustan\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nA tolerable degree of uniformity was also secured in the political\r\nstructure of the towns of Italy. It was but a development of the typical\r\nItalian constitution of magistrates (_magistratus potestatesve_),[1484]\r\nsenate (_senatus_, _curia_, composed of _decuriones conscriptive_), and\r\npopular assembly (_comitia conciliumve_, composed of _municipes_ and\r\nsometimes of _incolae_); and the _lex Julia municipalis_ of Caesar (45\r\nB.C.) ordains a uniform qualification for the local magistracies and\r\nsenates, and enjoins that the local census shall be taken in conjunction\r\nwith that of Rome. But, though the general lines of organisation were the\r\nsame, this uniformity was chiefly the result of growth, not of creation.\r\nNo effort was made at securing a common nomenclature either for the\r\nstates or for their officials. Caesar’s municipal law shows _municipia_,\r\n_coloniae_ and _praefecturae_ existing side by side,[1485] while\r\ninscriptions show titles for officials, such as dictator or praetor,\r\nwhich may be as old as those of Roman magistrates.[1486]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE ORGANISATION AND GOVERNMENT OF THE PROVINCES\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Rome had asserted her supremacy over the greater part of Sicily\r\nat the close of the first Punic war, a new problem in organisation was\r\npresented to her. She held, perhaps rightly, that these new dependencies,\r\nwith their transmarine position, fickle politics, and in some cases\r\nCarthaginian sympathies, could not safely be included in the military\r\nsymmachy of Italy; so she substituted tribute for military service,\r\nplaced the command of the cities of a wide district under the guidance\r\nof the personal _imperium_, and created the first permanent external\r\ndepartment of administration (_provincia_). The government which had been\r\nadopted for Hellenic cities was still more necessary for the barbarians\r\nof Spain, a country which Rome had not sought but which military\r\nexigencies alone warned her not to leave. The recognition of Empire\r\nin the West was rapid and easy, for the effective government of Italy\r\nseemed to involve the control of the Tyrrhenian Sea. The Senate showed\r\ngreater hesitancy in accepting a similar Adriatic policy, and declined\r\nto recognise that Rome had permanent interests even in eastern Europe\r\nof a magnitude that should lead to Empire. War followed war, Greece was\r\nonce and Macedon twice at her feet, but on every occasion she declined\r\nto annex. It was not until experience had proved the costliness and the\r\ndanger of a protectorate that in 146 B.C. Macedonia was recognised as\r\na province with Achaea as its annexe. The troublesome relations with\r\nCarthage had meanwhile ended in war and annexation, and what had hitherto\r\nbeen rather a distant problem—Rome’s relations with the potentates of\r\nAsia—became, as the years rolled on and as Roman trade struck deeper\r\nroots in the East, one of paramount concern. The history of eastern\r\nEurope was repeated in Asia, and although Rome had already a foothold\r\nin Anatolia through her acceptance of the kingdom of Pergamus, the\r\ndeath-blow to the protectorate system in these regions was first struck\r\nby Pompeius’ organisation of the East at the close of the Mithridatic\r\nwars (65-63). Further extensions in the West and North, which resulted in\r\nthe conquest of further Spain and of Gaul, were due to the enterprise of\r\nindividual commanders, or to the search for a frontier which should be a\r\npermanent protection against barbarian invasion; and at the close of the\r\nRepublic the list of Roman provinces had risen to fifteen.[1487]\r\n\r\nThe idea of a province was that of an aggregate of states (_civitates_);\r\nwhere Greek or Phoenician civilisation had penetrated, these states\r\nwere cities, but sometimes, as in Gaul and Spain, they were cantons\r\nor tribes. Natural political associations were usually chosen as the\r\nunits of government, although formidable combinations were broken up,\r\nand the numerical regulation of the government centres in a province\r\nwas an integral part of its organisation. Thus the number of communal\r\nunions was in Sicily 68,[1488] in Asia 44,[1489] and 64 in Transalpine\r\nGaul.[1490] Such aggregates probably include the free and federate\r\nstates, which, although geographically, were not juristically within the\r\nprovince at all. The cities which were _liberae_ and those which were\r\n_liberae et foederatae_ differed, sometimes perhaps in the degree, but\r\nalways in the basis, of their rights. The latter had the grant of their\r\nrights embodied in a sworn treaty (_foedus_), which was the product in\r\nthe earlier Republic of Senate and people, in the later of either of\r\nthese powers,[1491]—a guarantee which was meant to be perpetual, and the\r\nbreach of which was either an act of war or its result. A charter (_lex\r\ndata_), on the other hand,[1492] which made a city only “free” might be\r\nrevoked at any moment. The rights common to both groups of states are\r\npractically those of the Italian communes[1493]—a control of their own\r\nfinances, a free enjoyment of their land which exempted them from the\r\npayment of tribute, and above all a use and enjoyment of their own native\r\nlaw[1494]—and both agree in being entirely outside the sphere of the\r\ngovernor’s jurisdiction.[1495] He could enter such a privileged city only\r\nas a guest, and although for purposes of convenience great central cities\r\nwhich were free, as Antioch in Syria and Thessalonica in Macedonia, were,\r\nfrom their position as natural capitals, chosen as the residence of the\r\ngovernor, he merely exercised jurisdiction in these towns, not over their\r\ncitizens. More distant still from provincial rule were the allied kings\r\n(_reges socii_) on the frontiers. Their independence was less conditioned\r\nthan that of the free and allied cities, for they were bound to furnish\r\nless definite assistance to Rome in time of need, and their foreign\r\nactivity was not wholly destroyed. But the chief reason why in a list of\r\nRome’s friends they appear in a separate category[1496] is that a treaty\r\nwith a king was not, like one with a Republic, regarded as eternal. It\r\nwas a personal obligation, and its perpetual validity depended on its\r\nrenewal with each successive occupant of the throne.\r\n\r\nStates which belonged to neither of these categories were subject or,\r\nas the phrase ran, tributary (_stipendiariae_), the test of subjection\r\nbeing the normal one in the ancient world of the payment of a tax to\r\na superior. Yet these too had their rights and their charter. The\r\nguarantee, however, was no longer individual but collective, and was\r\ncontained in the law of the province (_lex provinciae_). This law was\r\nusually the work of the conquering general himself, assisted by ten\r\nsenatorial commissioners (_decem legati_) appointed by the Senate,\r\nand it continued to bear the name of its chief creator, as we see in\r\nthe cases of the _lex Rupilia_ of Sicily,[1497] the _lex Aemilia_ of\r\nMacedonia,[1498] and the _lex Pompeia_ of Bithynia.[1499] While it\r\nre-established the states of a conquered district, it also gave them\r\ncertain ultimate rights. It defined the burden of the tribute, specified\r\nthe particular circuit-courts which the citizens of the various towns\r\nwere to attend, and framed regulations, which the governor was expected\r\nto observe, about national and international jurisdiction. But these\r\nregulations, slight and general as they were, are no sufficient test of\r\nthe amount of autonomy, in administration and jurisdiction, actually\r\nenjoyed by the subject towns. Much of their independence was permissive\r\nand based on the will of the governor. But the ruler, whether honest or\r\ndishonest, was practically bound to grant it, for the Roman government\r\nhad provided him with no staff which could take over the minuter duties\r\nof administration; if he was an enlightened man, he cherished the fiction\r\nthat the states were free;[1500] if unenlightened, he at least knew that\r\nby permitting self-government he was saving himself trouble. In the case\r\nof the eastern cities the neglect of the governor was almost as great an\r\nevil as his exactions.[1501]\r\n\r\nThe theory of Roman taxation was in origin that it was a war indemnity.\r\nThis accounts for the fact that in the early days of Rome’s dealings\r\nwith conquered peoples a tax might be imposed even on nations which\r\nwere declared free,[1502] and for the name _stipendium_ (“payment for\r\nthe army”) which was borne by the direct taxation imposed by Roman\r\ncommissioners on provincials.[1503] This equitable theory, that the taxes\r\ncollected should merely defray the expenses of the military occupation\r\nand administration of a province, seems to have been realised in practice\r\nwhere the Roman government took the trouble to organise a system of its\r\nown. The Macedonians were made to pay but half of what they had paid to\r\ntheir kings,[1504] the Spanish provinces must have cost more than they\r\nbrought in, and in Cicero’s time it was only the Asiatic provinces,\r\nwhere taxes were imposed on quite a different system, that yielded a\r\nsurplus.[1505] It was this system, which the Romans found existing in\r\nSicily, Sardinia, and Asia, and with their characteristic negligence\r\nelected to preserve, which changed the whole theory of Roman taxation.\r\nThe principle was that of the payment by the cultivator (_arator_) of\r\na tithe (_decuma_) of the produce of his land. It was inevitable that\r\nthe Roman lawyer should associate this due with the _vectigal_ paid by\r\nthe occupants of _ager publicus_, and should evolve from the comparison\r\nthe strange theory that land in the provinces was not owned but merely\r\n“possessed” by its holders.[1506] The chief practical consequences of the\r\ntithe system were a surplus to the treasury, and the exactions of the\r\nmiddlemen (_publicani_) through the indirect system of collection which\r\nit involved.\r\n\r\nThe direct tax (_stipendium_) was collected by a tribute assessed either\r\non the land (_tributum soli_) or on the personalty of individuals\r\n(_tributum capitis_).[1507] The Romans of the Republic seem never to\r\nhave attempted to form an accurate estimate of the resources furnished\r\nby the land and personal wealth of a province; doubtless in Hellenised\r\ndistricts they employed the systems which they found existing, such as\r\nthe schedules which formed the bases of the εἰσφοραί: in Spain amongst\r\nother rough expedients they seem to have adopted a valuation tax on a\r\nproportion of the produce of the soil;[1508] while elsewhere, as in\r\nMacedonia,[1509] they fixed a total on the existing basis of collection.\r\nThe direct tax was usually collected by the communes themselves and paid\r\nto the governor’s quaestor.\r\n\r\nThe tithe (_decuma_) was collected on the contract system, and the\r\ndifference in its mode of collection in the _vectigales provinciae_\r\ndepended on whether the site of the auction was in the province itself,\r\nwhere local companies or even communities[1510] could compete for its\r\ncollection, or whether the tithes of the whole province must be put up\r\nto auction in Rome, in which case the province was likely to become the\r\nprey of a single Roman company. In Sicily the first system was adopted in\r\naccordance with the principles laid down by Hiero, its last great king\r\n(_lex Hieronica_);[1511] the second system was devised by C. Gracchus\r\nfor Asia and was doubtless extended to eastern provinces subsequently\r\norganised such as Cilicia.[1512] The pretext for the change was no doubt\r\nthe incapacity of the Asiatic cities to collect their own dues,[1513] and\r\nwas welcome to the weakness of the states, which liked to have near them\r\na body of Roman capitalists from whom they could borrow in emergency; but\r\nit created a pernicious connexion between capitalism and administration\r\nwhich made the government of the Asiatic dependencies the gloomiest scene\r\nof Roman rule. The tithe system in Asia, and perhaps in other provinces\r\nwhere it prevailed, was abolished by Caesar in 48 B.C.[1514] The harbour\r\nand frontier dues (_portoria_), the source of revenue next in value to\r\nthe direct tribute or the tithe, were collected by private companies\r\n(_portitores_) perhaps throughout the whole imperial world, as they\r\nhad been from the earliest times in Italy.[1515] Other dues demanded\r\nfrom the province were paid for by the Roman government. Such were the\r\ncorn supplied for the praetor and his retinue (_frumentum in cellam_ or\r\n_frumentum aestimatum_),[1516] and the second _decuma_ sometimes required\r\nby the state (_frumentum emptum_) and raised by command of the Senate\r\nand people.[1517] In both these cases a reasonable price was fixed by the\r\nRoman government.\r\n\r\nWe pass now to the governor and his staff. The early institution\r\nof praetors and the later use of the pro-magistracy for provincial\r\ngovernment have already been described.[1518] But we have seen that even\r\nSulla did not formally dissociate the consulship and praetorship from\r\nprovincial rule.[1519] The consequences of this continued association\r\nwere curious. By a law of C. Gracchus, which aimed at destroying one\r\nof the most valuable pieces of patronage which the Senate had at its\r\ndisposal, the consular provinces must be assigned before the election\r\nof their holders.[1520] They are strictly consular, and are technically\r\nentered on by their possessors on March 1 of their year of office,\r\nalthough no definite agreement need be come to as to their partition\r\nuntil the following December[1521]—the earliest date at which the consuls\r\nof the later Republic could quit their urban duties. March 1 was the\r\nbeginning of the military and provincial year, as since 152 B.C. January\r\n1 had been of the year of civil office at Rome. The reason why the 1st of\r\nMarch of the year of office at Rome was chosen, and not the same date in\r\nthe following year, was that the pro-magistracy was not yet recognised as\r\na separate office, and that, if this second solution had been adopted,\r\nthe interval between December 29 and March 1 would have caused a break\r\nin the _imperium_.[1522] The anomaly resulted that a provincial governor\r\nheld his command only for two months in his own right, and for ten months\r\nwhile waiting for his successor. It was harmless in practice, inasmuch as\r\nSulla’s law had ordained that the governor should retain his _imperium_\r\nuntil he returned to Rome, and need only quit his province thirty days\r\nafter the arrival of his successor,[1523] and was only accidentally\r\ndisastrous as leading to the quarrel between Caesar and the Senate, and\r\nthence to the downfall of the Roman Republic. The pro-magistracy was\r\nfirst raised into a separate office by a Pompeian law of 52 B.C., which\r\nenacted that governors should seek their provinces five years after\r\nholding office at Rome. It was a law that, by diminishing the nearness\r\nof the prize, was intended to make the consulship and praetorship less\r\nan object of illegitimate ambition at Rome. It might, therefore, have\r\nconferred a slight indirect benefit on the provincials, but the speedy\r\ncollapse of the Republican government prevented its adequacy being\r\ntested. The tenure of a provincial governorship was nominally annual,\r\nbut, even after Sulla had raised the number of praetors to eight, there\r\nwere but ten magistrates available for fifteen provinces, and we know of\r\nthree propraetors—Verres in Sicily, Q. Cicero in Asia, and Fonteius in\r\nNarbonese Gaul—who severally held their provincial commands for three\r\nyears in succession.\r\n\r\nThe chief members of the governor’s staff were one subordinate\r\nmagistrate, the quaestor, and certain senatorial commissioners\r\n(_legati_), one of whom was usually assigned to a praetorian, and three\r\nto a consular province. The magisterial position of the quaestor did\r\nnot entitle him to an independent sphere of duties. It is true that he\r\nwas, in the main, a financial official, was entrusted by the Senate\r\nwith money or a credit for meeting the expenses of the administration\r\nof his province,[1524] received the revenues from the _stipendium_, and\r\nhad at the end of the year to give an account of income and expenditure\r\nin his own name and that of his superior;[1525] but even here the\r\nreal responsibility was incurred by the governor, whose commands were\r\nirresistible, and in all other respects the quaestor is the merest\r\ndelegate, who exercises jurisdiction, or any kind of administrative\r\nwork, in obedience to a voice that was supposed to convey a paternal\r\nauthority.[1526] He might even, like the legates, be dismissed for\r\nincompetence or maladministration before the term of his office had\r\nexpired.[1527] The _legati_ had originally been representatives of\r\nthe government in Rome, but, to avoid friction, the custom grew up of\r\nallowing governors to suggest individuals for the post.[1528] Yet to\r\nthe end of the Republic their names were submitted to the Senate, and\r\nthey were supposed to be subordinate officials of the state. No special\r\ndepartments were, however, assigned them; any power which they exercised\r\nwas delegated by the governor, whether it took the form of the command\r\nof a legion or the presidency of a court. A still more independent\r\nselection was made of the unofficial members of the staff. The “comrades”\r\n(_comites_) of the governor were young men, whom he initiated in the\r\nmysteries of official and diplomatic life, and whose services he employed\r\nfor any purpose for which they seemed competent.[1529] But, however many\r\ninstruments the governor might use, there was such a complete unity of\r\nresponsibility that, in dealing with the administration of a province, we\r\nare treating of the powers of a single man.\r\n\r\nThese powers were exercised chiefly in three spheres—military,\r\nadministrative, and judicial. In a province that seethed with war the\r\nsummer months were spent in camp, the winter in more peaceful duties;\r\nbut in a settled district the governor could map out his circuits as he\r\npleased, and devote some time to the ungenial task of inspecting the\r\naffairs of the municipalities under his control. Apart from the necessary\r\ndiplomatic intercourse with neighbouring potentates or protected chiefs,\r\nthe amount of administrative work which the governor undertook was as\r\nmuch or as little as he pleased. Its quantity depended on his view as to\r\nhow far self-government was a symptom of health or of disease. That it\r\nsometimes had the latter character is shown by the startling discovery\r\nmade by Cicero when he undertook an unexpected investigation into the\r\nfinancial affairs of his subject states. He found that the native Greek\r\nmagistrates of Cilicia had been plundering their respective treasuries\r\nfor the last ten years.[1530] But the possibility of such a discovery\r\nis itself a testimony to the best aspect of provincial rule in the\r\nRepublic—its noble but sometimes misguided belief in the capacity of\r\npeople to govern themselves.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, one systematic function to which most of the\r\ngovernor’s energies were directed in time of peace, and that was\r\njurisdiction, both civil and criminal. General regulations concerning\r\njurisdiction were made in the charters of the provinces; but these could\r\nnot be the same for every country, since the judicial machinery of some\r\ngroups of states was far more perfect than that of others. Sicily, the\r\nonly province the details of whose _lex_ are known, was peculiarly\r\nfavoured, and its privileges may be taken as the best type of those\r\noffered by Rome. It was ordained that, in a suit between two citizens\r\nof the same state, the trial should be held in that state and according\r\nto its laws,[1531] a regulation which certainly guaranteed the native\r\n_judex_ and the native code, but which did not, perhaps, inhibit an\r\nappeal to the governor or take away his right of interpreting the law.\r\nThe charter then provides for cases of inter-political jurisdiction.\r\nIf a Sicilian of one state sues a Sicilian of another, the governor is\r\nto provide by lot the _judex_ or _judices_,[1532] who are perhaps in\r\nthis case to be Roman citizens.[1533] When litigation arises between\r\nan individual and a community not his own, the Senate of some third\r\nstate should be the judge, when either litigant has challenged one\r\nof three senatorial bodies proposed.[1534] In suits between Roman\r\ncitizens and Sicilians the _judex_ was to be of the nationality of the\r\ndefendant.[1535] In all other matters _judices_ chosen by the magistrate\r\n(_selecti_) were to be appointed from the Roman citizens dwelling within\r\nthe assize.[1536]\r\n\r\nIn Sicily it is clear that the _peregrinus judex_ was a standing\r\ninstitution. Elsewhere, even in the Hellenised East, his existence was\r\nmore dependent on the grace of the governor. Cicero, in his government of\r\nCilicia, following the precedent of Mucius Scaevola, the ideal governor\r\nof Asia, allowed the greatest freedom to the native laws, courts, and\r\njudges, and remarks on the quickened life which their use inspired in\r\nthe provincials.[1537] The attempt, indeed, to substitute her own for\r\nthe native law was abhorrent to the political sense of Rome, and her\r\nmost ambitious representatives never attempted to make their edicts\r\ninto codes. The importance of the edict was chiefly felt in matters of\r\nprivate international law, administrative jurisdiction, and procedure.\r\nIt stated principles which should regulate the relations between members\r\nof different states or between provincials and Romans, it issued rules\r\nfor the settlement of claims made by the _publicani_, and it supplemented\r\nthe law of the province by framing regulations for the conduct of private\r\nsuits. The edict of each province was a separate entity, and drew its\r\nname from the country to which it directly applied,[1538] and it had\r\na continuous existence, although the unity and continuity of its life\r\ndepended too much on the discretion of the individual governor.[1539] The\r\nedict might be composed at Rome,[1540] and its author might copy from\r\nmore than one original. The rulings of his predecessor would doubtless\r\nbe well known; there were the edicts of other provinces, the work of\r\nfamous administrators of the past;[1541] and, as a fruitful source of\r\ngeneral rules of procedure, there was the _edictum perpetuum_ of the\r\ncapital In Cicero’s own edict, of which he furnishes a brief description,\r\nthe principles regulating business and trading relations (especially\r\nas existing between Roman companies and provincials) were clearly and\r\nfully set forth. As much attention was devoted to the general rules of\r\ninheritance and bankruptcy, such as had been evolved by the _imperium_ at\r\nRome, and which were doubtless meant not to supersede the customs of the\r\nvarious communities, but to be a common law for the province as a whole.\r\nBut much remained that could not be formulated. A province had boundless\r\nsurprises in store, and Cicero found it wiser to leave the third part\r\nof his edict “unwritten.” The principles of the urban praetor were to\r\nbe drawn upon as occasion required.[1542] The civil jurisdiction of the\r\ngovernor, which was based on the edict, was either personal or delegated,\r\nand in both cases required the visitation of circuits (_conventus_,\r\nδιοικήσεις),[1543] into which the province had been divided at the time\r\nof its organisation. A programme of the assize was drawn up, the stay in\r\neach circuit was accurately determined,[1544] and the governor held a\r\ncourt (_forum egit_) in each of them in turn.[1545]\r\n\r\nDelegated jurisdiction was performed usually by the quaestor and the\r\nlegates; in both cases it was due to the mandate of the governor,[1546]\r\nwho could assign them lictors, if he pleased,[1547] and could always\r\ncontrol their sentences.[1548]\r\n\r\nThe governor possessed an unfettered criminal jurisdiction over the\r\nmembers of the stipendiary states; but it cannot be supposed that\r\nhe often exercised it. He might summon any case into his court, but\r\nordinary crimes he doubtless left to the judicial machinery of the states\r\nthemselves.[1549] On the other hand, it was held that an offence might\r\nbe of such import as to transcend even his competence; and although\r\nthere was no legal means of escaping his jurisdiction, it was considered\r\nadvisable that he should send cases of a grave political character—those,\r\nfor instance, connected with sedition or a popular rising—to be tried at\r\nRome.[1550] The only restraining influence on the governor’s jurisdiction\r\nwas the necessity, imposed by custom, of consulting a council of\r\nadvisers.[1551] This _consilium_, however, was purely Roman, being\r\ncomposed of Roman citizens residing in the _conventus_ and of members of\r\nthe governor’s retinue,[1552] and although a council composed wholly of\r\nthe latter was usually avoided, there was no legal hindrance to such a\r\nnarrow selection.[1553]\r\n\r\nOver Roman citizens in the provinces the governor possessed the same\r\nautocratic power; for his jurisdiction here is on a level with that of\r\nthe camp, and he gives judgment in a sphere to which the _provocatio_\r\ndoes not extend.[1554] Yet a strong customary law, which was seldom\r\ndisobeyed, directed that he should remit to Rome all cases in which\r\nRoman citizens were to be tried on a capital charge, and that, if he\r\npronounced judgment himself, he should inflict on them no degrading\r\npunishments.[1555]\r\n\r\nAlmost every item in the provincial organisation that we have sketched\r\nshows where its inherent weakness lay. It resided in the uncontrolled\r\npower of the governor. Yet it was a weakness more apparent in practice\r\nthan in theory. There were many controlling forces at work which the\r\norganiser and the government hoped would be effective. There were the\r\ncharters of cities and of provinces, and in the province a constant, if\r\nimprovised, committee of the Senate, which the governor was supposed\r\nto consult before he ventured on any important step.[1556] There was\r\nan unparalleled amount of legislation intended for the protection of\r\nprovincials and expressed in enactments dealing with the ordering of the\r\nprovinces, the rights of magistrates, and with extortion (_de provinciis\r\nordinandis_, _de jure magistratuum_, _repetundarum_); and, lastly,\r\nthere was the criminal responsibility supposed to be enforced by the\r\ncourts which carried out these laws. Some of these checks—the charters\r\nof the favoured cities, the senatorial commission—were real, but were\r\nnot far-reaching enough seriously to affect the form of provincial\r\nrule. Those of the laws were almost nugatory, for though the government\r\nthat proposed them had a collective conscience, its individual members\r\nwho were bound by them had none, and the courts that were supposed to\r\nenforce these laws became the prey of party strife and the weapon of\r\nparty fanatics. But a government that depends on protective legislation\r\nand the enforcement of criminal responsibility must be in a perilous\r\nstate. The defect must be in the principle of rule, not merely in\r\nits working. And in truth the Republican theory of provincial rule\r\nrepresents a fundamental inconsistency of idea. The theory aimed at the\r\nimpossible combination of martial law with municipal independence. Had\r\nthe rights of all the states been provided with better safeguards, their\r\nself-government might have been more real, and the autocracy of the\r\ngovernor might have been proportionately checked. But this solution would\r\nhave been an offence to the idea of the unlimited _imperium_, a clinging\r\nsuperstition which the Romans had inherited from the history of their own\r\nstate and her days of conquest. The Roman Empire had been developed from\r\na protectorate; it bears to the end of the Republican period the traces\r\nof its origin, and, in its lack of organisation, conveys the suggestion\r\nof being a merely provisional government. The merits of such system as\r\nthere was cannot be ignored. The unrestricted _imperium_ was necessary\r\nin time of war and, under a benevolent despot, might be useful even in\r\ndays of peace, while the very absence of organisation betrays the noble\r\nbelief that the aggregate of states which formed a province was rather\r\na confederated suzerainty than an integral part of an empire. But its\r\ndefects are more glaring and are to be found in the absence of some\r\ncentral authority at home, not interested in provincial misrule, which\r\nmight enforce responsibility on governors; in the existence of annual\r\ncommands, and the exaggeration of routine which rendered extraordinary\r\nappointments, such as that of Pompeius, inevitable; and in the lack of\r\nan organised civil service, which, with its mechanical routine and its\r\nself-evolved rules, is perhaps the surest of all checks on autocracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLUTION AND THE TRANSITION TO THE PRINCIPATE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe party of reform which, during the last century of the Republic,\r\ngave a new development to the elastic Roman constitution, by gradually\r\ncreating a stronger executive organ than had been known since the time\r\nof the monarchy, had two distinguishing features. One was an opposition,\r\nsometimes rational, sometimes blind, to the senatorial government; the\r\nother the exposition of a positive programme for remedying evils which\r\nall but the most callous or careless could see. The nature of their\r\nattack varied with the assailable features presented by its object. At\r\nfirst it was directed against the assumed indifference of the Senate to\r\ninternal reform and its failure to suggest hasty remedies for economic\r\ngrievances. This was the essential feature of the Gracchan movement;\r\nbut, although its example was perilous, the immediate effects of this\r\nfirst revolution were transitory in the extreme. The Senate emerged from\r\nthe attack shaken but victorious. Italy was but of little account when\r\nthe world lay at the feet of the noble families who composed the great\r\ncouncil of state, and the Senate could be made to appear the only true\r\ngovernment for an empire. Unfortunately this theory was rudely shaken. A\r\nmiserable war in a protected state, into which the government was most\r\nunwillingly dragged, was thought sufficient to show that the merits of\r\nthe senatorial administration of the empire were an illusion. The epoch\r\nof the Jugurthine war is the turning-point of the history of this period.\r\nA reforming party with an imperial policy must associate itself with\r\nthe military power. The change was rapidly effected. Tribunes, commons,\r\nassemblies still represent the nominal sovereigns, but their weapons—too\r\npowerful for the users—are the _imperator_, the army, and the camp.\r\nHenceforth we find a perpetual association of militarism with democracy\r\nwhich could have but one issue, a monarchy resting on the sword.\r\n\r\nBut to the reformers of the times the ultimate solution of the\r\nconstitutional problem was something far less present than the programme\r\nof reform, which was being handed on from leader to leader with scarcely\r\nan item altered since the time when the genius of C. Gracchus had given\r\nit birth. It contained agrarian laws, measures for corn distribution and\r\nfor colonies beyond the sea, means for relieving social distress and the\r\nplethora of the great capital, and at times it admitted—the most pressing\r\nneed of all—proposals for remedying the iniquitous relations that the\r\nlaw permitted to exist between debtor and creditor. A new and unexpected\r\ndevelopment was given to the activities of the party by the introduction\r\ninto their programme of proposals for enfranchising the Italians.\r\nThis was a measure that, like so many others in popular programmes,\r\nwas a creation of the demagogue and was profoundly distasteful to his\r\nfollowers. Its acceptance by the Liberals (_populares_) was a pure\r\naccident—one due to the desire of breaking a formidable weapon employed\r\nby the Whig opposition, who, like Scipio Aemilianus, had adopted the\r\nsomewhat dangerous policy of playing off Italian rights against those\r\nof the city proletariate. But, as belief usually follows acceptance,\r\nthere is some reason for regarding the franchise question as, at least\r\nfinally, a plank in the democratic programme. In the multiform efforts\r\nof the discontented we can also discern the spasmodic attempt to create\r\na competent central military authority for Rome, as the only means of\r\nsecuring corn, commerce, and the empire.\r\n\r\nIt was by no means a homogeneous party which developed this programme and\r\nattempted to replace a government which they deemed incompetent. Even its\r\nmore thorough-going members cannot be described by a single name. Amongst\r\nthe _populares_ were many Liberals who had nothing to gain by revolution;\r\nbut amongst them were also to be found many who were democrats by\r\nnecessity as well as by conviction, the revolutionary element which\r\nwas often a thorn in the side of the reforming constitutionalists, the\r\nclass of _improbi_ which supplied Catiline’s so-called “conspiracy”\r\nand made it a genuine democratic movement, and whose aspirations were\r\nsubsequently represented by Caelius Rufus and Dolabella. Nor must it be\r\nsupposed that there was any clear line of demarcation between _populares_\r\nand senators. Nowhere was the Senate more bitterly attacked than from\r\nwithin its own body. The leaders of the extreme party had attained the\r\nmagistracies that entitled them to a seat in the Curia, and elections, so\r\nfar as they were not gained by family influence or bribery, were fought\r\non party lines. Nor even amongst the constitutionalists was there a lack\r\nof would-be reformers of a more moderate type. The elder Cato and the\r\nScipionic circle, while eager to maintain senatorial ascendency, had\r\nbeen conscious of some of its defects; and, as the cry for innovation\r\ngathered in strength, a party was formed which, by borrowing wholesale\r\nfrom the radical programme, attempted to reconcile the privileges of\r\ntheir order with concessions to Italy, purity in imperial administration,\r\nand care for the poor of Rome. This attempt was shattered by the fate\r\nof the younger Drusus, and henceforth there is no senatorial party of\r\nreform. Even Cicero, with his wide sympathies and his acute sense of\r\nthe evils of the time, can suggest only a _concordia ordinum_, merely\r\na means of bolstering up the existing constitution by means of a union\r\nof the propertied and therefore “loyal” classes (_boni_). The municipal\r\nstatesman did, indeed, wish to see an “Italian” rather than a “Roman”\r\ngovernment, but he had no scheme by which Italy could have secured\r\nrepresentation at Rome, and before the close of his life he had accepted\r\nthe inevitable solution of personal rule. There was to be a _moderator\r\nrei publicae_, a _princeps civitatis_;[1557] but this monarchy is not to\r\ndestroy the constitution; his prince is to be a loyal coadjutor of the\r\nSenate, not the exponent of a military despotism.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that with parties so evenly balanced as the _populares_\r\nand _optimates_ no very decisive result would have been attained, had it\r\nnot been for the existence in the state of a perfectly homogeneous body\r\nof men with few ideals but very decided wants. This was that upper middle\r\nclass of large and moderate capitalists which, through an accident in\r\nnomenclature, had come to be known as _equites_.[1558] It was a class\r\nthat possessed the tradesman’s narrow honesty and complete indifference\r\nto all politics not connected with business. Like all classes, they\r\nwere quite willing to plunder the provinces while state officials did\r\nthe same; but they desired strong government more than plunder. They\r\nlonged for an administration which should secure them adequate protection\r\nin the conquered world over which they had spread the network of their\r\ntrade, and which should also ensure a freedom from revolution at home.\r\nHence their wavering and yet always decisive attitude. To secure their\r\nfirst end they join the attacking party, to secure their second they\r\nattach themselves to the government, and their adherence or disaffection\r\nalways turns the fortune of the day. It was the _equites_ who helped the\r\ndemocrats to raise Marius to power, who forced their own creature to\r\nabandon his revolutionary colleague Saturninus, who ruined the schemes\r\nof the younger Drusus and set the Varian commission on the track of\r\nhis adherents; it was their hostility that proved equally fatal to the\r\nschemes of Sulla and of Catiline, their commercial instincts which lifted\r\nPompeius into power and led them at the crisis of 60 B.C. to abandon\r\nthe Senate and give their whole support to Caesar. There is something\r\ntragic in the ruthless massacre of _equites_ which ushers in the Augustan\r\nmonarchy; for no class had done more for its existence and to none did it\r\nprove a greater boon.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate the issue of this struggle in which all parties were\r\nengaged, we must recognise its twofold aspect as a struggle for social\r\nand political renewal, and consider separately the fate of the detailed\r\nprogramme of reform and the change in the constitution to which the\r\nattacks on the Senate led. From the first point of view the efforts of\r\nthe democratic party ended in an unqualified success; for every item\r\nof its programme was carried out, with the requisite modifications, by\r\nCaesar and the Principate. The agrarian question reached as near an\r\napproach to settlement as such eternal questions can attain, especially\r\nwhen it became absorbed into the movement of transmarine colonisation\r\nwhich was employed in the Principate for poorer citizens and for\r\nveterans. The extension of the franchise was completed, so far as the\r\nterritory south of the Alps was concerned, by Caesar’s renewal of the\r\ngift of citizenship to the Transpadanes and Augustus’ incorporation\r\nof their territory as a part of Italy,[1559] while the Principate was\r\nliberal with the conferment of Latin rights on provinces, such as Sicily,\r\nthe Maritime Alps, and Spain, and the full citizenship gradually won its\r\nway in the provincial world by individual grants and recruiting for the\r\nlegions. The laws of debt were emended by the just bankruptcy laws of\r\nCaesar and Augustus, and even the _leges frumentariae_ required but a\r\nslight modification to make them a genuine scheme of poor-relief.[1560]\r\nThe _equites_, too, the class to whom C. Gracchus had given an official\r\nrecognition, became a still more recognised order under the Principate\r\nand a most useful wheel in the administrative machinery.\r\n\r\nIt is more difficult to decide whether the radical change of government\r\nto which the agitation led can be considered a genuine triumph for the\r\nreformers. Military monarchy may be regretted by those who see in it a\r\nconfession of incapacity to combine imperial government with Republican\r\ninstitutions; but, from the point of view of the reforming party, it was\r\nonly a disappointment if we conceive that their leaders thought that\r\ngovernment by _comitia_ might replace the rule of the Senate. But there\r\nis hardly a trace of this idea. No effort was made throughout the whole\r\nof this period to make the _comitia_ a workable or really democratic\r\ninstitution; and personal rule, as the only expression of democracy, had\r\nasserted itself at the beginning of the movement. The only open question\r\nwas whether it should be a Periclean _tyrannis_ of the type enjoyed by C.\r\nGracchus or a Napoleonic rule such as that of Caesar. As a matter of fact\r\nthe Principate learnt a lesson from both solutions—that of the Gracchan\r\nand that of the Marian epoch—and established itself on a joint basis of\r\nthe _tribunicia potestas_ and the _proconsulare imperium_.\r\n\r\nIf we look round for other possible solutions, we find two faintly\r\nforeshadowed, but both doomed to failure. The first was a reformed\r\nSenate, not merely the existing body artificially bolstered up, as it had\r\nbeen by Sulla, but a body really made representative of Italy through\r\nthe free inclusion of _novi homines_. The idea was held by Cicero, but\r\nno scheme was ever considered which would have made it a reality. For\r\nsuch an object to be attained, election to those magistracies from\r\nwhich the Senate was recruited must cease to be in the hands of the\r\nRoman _comitia_; but no one to our knowledge, with the exception of\r\nthe Emperor Augustus, thought of the possibility of election by the\r\nmunicipal towns.[1561] Help might also have been looked for from a\r\nreformed assembly, one that had been made representative of the whole\r\nItalian people. The allies nearly worked out this means of salvation for\r\nthemselves,[1562] but the magnitude of Rome was itself a stumbling-block\r\nto the solution of the problem on federal lines. We can hardly blame the\r\nthinkers of the day for not seeing the possibility of a representative\r\nassembly of a national kind; for the Italian, like the Greek mind, though\r\nfamiliar enough with the idea of the representation of cities, had not\r\nadvanced to the conception of the representation of individuals through\r\nelectoral districts.\r\n\r\nThe reason why the creation of an Italian senate or an Italian\r\nassembly might have warded off the monarchy is that such a body might\r\nhave commanded respect even from the army of the provinces. This\r\ncorrespondence in sentiment might, it is true, have required that the\r\narmy should remain mainly Italian; and Augustus’ attempt to give Italy\r\nsomething of a representative character may have been abandoned through\r\nfear of a conflict between an army which was becoming provincial in\r\npersonnel and an Italian proletariate, when the choice of a Princeps had\r\nto be decided. Yet, although circumstances were hostile to a fusion of\r\nItaly and the provinces, and the Principate was not to be Italian, one\r\nshould not forget that it had something of a popular character. The Roman\r\ncitizens of the legions who made the Princeps[1563] were of a better type\r\nthan the _plebs urbana_ of Rome; for not only was the freedman element\r\neliminated, but discipline had with them replaced demoralisation, their\r\nlife was lived under healthier influences, and although they were often\r\nmoved to their selection by a mere _esprit de corps_, they generally\r\nsucceeded in placing a very capable man on the throne.\r\n\r\nCaesar was the first sole ruler of Rome; and we might be inclined to\r\nimagine that the powers which he enjoyed were consciously assumed merely\r\nas those of a provisional government, were there not signs that towards\r\nthe close of his life he was satisfied with the solution which he had\r\nadopted. The early dictatorships of 49 and 48 B.C., the second and longer\r\nof which was only for the term of a year,[1564] were merely efforts\r\nfor tiding over a crisis; and the same may perhaps be said of a later\r\ntenure of this office, which was conferred on him for ten years in 46\r\nB.C.[1565] But in the last year of his life (44 B.C.) he entered on a\r\nperpetual dictatorship,[1566] a revival of the Roman monarchy both in\r\nreality and in name. It is true that the title _rex_ was not assumed,\r\nout of deference to the feelings of the masses who saw in it merely a\r\nsynonym of oriental despotism; and for the same reason the diadem was\r\ndeclined.[1567] But every educated Roman knew that the Roman monarchy\r\nhad been nothing else than the unlimited _imperium_, and many may have\r\nbelieved that dictator or “master of the people” was the most significant\r\nof the titles of the king. It was, therefore, a _regnum_ under which\r\nRome was living,[1568] and there was no concealment of its military\r\ncharacter, for the title _imperator_ was now borne by the regent within\r\nthe walls.[1569] This designation was a mere symbol of military command\r\nand the fullest jurisdiction; it was no description of a basis actual or\r\nfuture on which Caesar’s power could rest, for the unqualified _imperium_\r\nhad no existence to the Roman mind, and, if it was to be unlimited, it\r\nmust be either regal or dictatorial.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the other powers which Caesar assumed, the _praefectura\r\nmorum_, given for three years in 45 B.C.,[1570] has the appearance of a\r\nspecial conferment for a given purpose; but the _tribunicia potestas_\r\nwas granted early in his period of rule (48 B.C.) and given for life; it\r\nmust have been regarded even now as the ideal complement of a lasting\r\n_imperium_, valuable for the inviolability it conferred and for the\r\n“civil” and popular colouring which it gave its holder. To realise the\r\nnature of Caesar’s authority by an inspection of the bases of his power\r\nneeded some reflection; but none was wanted to mark the external symbols\r\nof royalty—the triumphal robe, the portrait-head on coins, the statue\r\nplaced amongst those of the seven kings in the Capitol. These were the\r\nsymbols that were taken as tests of what the future monarchy was to\r\nbe, and which reduced, not merely rigid constitutionalists, but even\r\nmoderates and men of compromise, to despair. With Caesar conciliation was\r\nnot accompanied by its requisite complement, compromise; he was tender\r\nof everything but sentiment, and did not care to estimate the force\r\nof what he must have considered mere prejudice; but, in spite of the\r\nmodifications introduced into his theory of government by Augustus, it\r\nwas he who pointed out that the necessary basis for the future Principate\r\nwas the tribunician power combined with some kind of military _imperium_.\r\n\r\nThe murder of Caesar had, in words of the time, abolished the _rex_\r\nbut not the _regnum_,[1571] and the Triumvirate of 43 B.C. was but\r\na suspension of hostilities between the rival claimants. In form it\r\nwas a provisional government, like that of the early Decemvirate,\r\nfor the reform of the constitution, and received the sanction of the\r\npeople;[1572] but so purely was it an agreement between the contending\r\npersonalities that its renewal was contrived in 38 B.C. without any\r\nreference to the _comitia_.[1573] For ten years (38-28 B.C.) Octavian’s\r\nposition was far more irregular than that of Caesar had ever been, and,\r\neven after the defeat and death of Antonius, his sole claim to power was\r\nan _imperium_, which had never been conferred, irregularly continued from\r\na usurped Triumvirate. These indefinite powers resting, as he himself\r\ndescribes them, “on universal consent,”[1574] were essential to the\r\naccomplishment of the work that had to be done before the forms of the\r\nconstitution were restored. The consulships which he held did not give\r\nthe requisite authority, and the value of the _tribunicia potestas_,\r\nwhich he had possessed from 36 B.C.,[1575] was negative rather than\r\npositive. In the course of his sixth consulship (28 B.C.) he considered\r\nthe time to be ripe for a final settlement. It assumed the form of a\r\nsurrender. He issued a solemn decree in which he cancelled the irregular\r\nordinances of the Triumvirate,[1576] and he fixed January 1, 27 B.C.\r\nas the date on which he would divest himself of his extraordinary\r\npower.[1577] On this day “he gave back the commonwealth to the\r\ndiscretionary power of Senate and people.”[1578] A return was expected,\r\nand had doubtless been arranged, but the gift made by the grateful\r\nSenate seemed small in comparison with what had been surrendered. It was\r\nenough, however, to make the abdicating monarch a very powerful head of\r\nthe executive of the state. Augustus, as he was now for the first time\r\ndesignated,[1579] was given _imperium_ for ten years with the government\r\nof certain specified provinces,[1580] while at the same time he was made\r\ncommander-in-chief for life of all the forces of the state, with the sole\r\nright of raising levies and of making war and of declaring peace.[1581]\r\nYearly consulships were still the chief basis of his dignity, if not\r\nof his authority, in the capital, while the tribunician power still\r\ncontinued but was as yet sparingly employed.\r\n\r\nSuch was the settlement that was greeted, officially and unofficially, as\r\na restoration of the Republic,[1582] but which later writers held, with\r\nequal reason, to be the commencement of the legitimate monarchy.[1583]\r\nThe weak point in the arrangement was the authority of the prince within\r\nthe capital. The consulship had admirable Republican associations, but\r\nwas hemmed in by awkward limitations. Its jurisdiction had become almost\r\nextinct, its initiative was fettered by colleagueship, it was technically\r\nnot the highest power in the state, and the constant usurpation by the\r\nPrinceps of one of the two offices of highest titular rank was a bar to\r\nthe legitimate ambition of aspiring nobles. Hence the need for the new\r\nsettlement which was attained in 23 B.C. The details of the change, which\r\ngave the Principate its final form, will be described elsewhere. Its\r\nessential features were that the constant investiture with the consulship\r\nwas dispensed with, that the _tribunicia potestas_ was shifted from the\r\nbackground to become the chief symbol of authority for the Princeps in\r\nRome and Italy, and that an _imperium_, which must now be described as\r\n_proconsulare_, was renewed and perhaps increased.[1584] Further isolated\r\ngrants were made to fill up the gaps in this heterogeneous association of\r\npowers, and to elevate the new extraordinary magistrate of the Republic\r\nto the requisite height above the ordinary officials of the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCIPATE\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. _The Powers of the Princeps_\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the powers on which Augustus based his position as\r\nPrinceps were the _proconsulare imperium_ and the _tribunicia potestas_.\r\nIn the theory of a constitution which he presented to the world the first\r\nof these prerogatives was supposed to establish his power outside Rome\r\nand Italy, the second, with its purely civic traditions, to be the basis\r\nof his influence within the central state. His object in exalting the\r\ntribunician power to the first place in Rome and her Italian dependencies\r\nnow merged in the city, was to conceal as carefully as possible the\r\nmilitary basis of his rule. The unlimited _imperium_ was to be felt only\r\nby his army and his provincial subjects.\r\n\r\nIt needed little reflection to show that this principle, although\r\nin appearance the most important that underlay the Principate, was\r\npractically unworkable. Government in Rome was inconceivable without an\r\n_imperium_, and supreme government impossible without one of such an\r\nindefinite character that it should seem to stand out of relation to the\r\nregular and limited _imperia_ of consuls and praetors. This power was\r\nsecured by an easy juristic device. By a special exemption, which had its\r\nprototypes in Republican history, the Emperor was allowed to _retain_\r\nthe full _imperium_ within the walls;[1585] and lawyers were careful not\r\nto declare explicitly what was implied in this retention. It might have\r\nmeant—as it would have meant during the Republic—that the Emperor was not\r\ndebarred by his presence in Rome from holding command abroad. It might\r\nsignify that the limitations imposed by the city walls now rendered the\r\nproconsular a quasi-consular _imperium_, and this was perhaps the ruling\r\ntheory. But a different line of interpretation would have rendered it\r\neasy to show that the _imperium_ here as elsewhere was unlimited. The\r\nnebulous atmosphere of this mockery of a magistracy was as well suited\r\nto the despot as to the constitutional ruler. In the actual position\r\nof the Princeps within Rome we find traces of all these theories. As\r\na provincial ruler he governs from the capital; as commander-in-chief\r\nhe keeps his praetorian guards in Italy and his fleets at Ravenna and\r\nMisenum; while as the wielder of an undefined but civic _imperium_ he\r\ngives justice, as a court of first instance or a court of appeal, and\r\nissues edicts to supplement the laws.\r\n\r\nBut the recognition of an _imperium_ within Rome was not alone\r\nsufficient. Even when this was joined to the tribunician power, great\r\ngaps were left in the position which should be held by a true head of\r\nthe state. To fill these up, and thus supply a solid foundation for\r\nautocracy, fresh grants of isolated powers were necessary; and these\r\ngrants, though in theory occasional, soon became permanent in practice.\r\nThe Emperor, like the tribune, possessed no distinctive official dress\r\nwhile he resided in Rome: hence the consular _insignia_ had to be\r\nconferred;[1586] he possessed in virtue of his tribunician power only\r\nthe right of making the third proposal at the Senate: hence the grant of\r\nthe _jus primae relationis_.[1587] Such grants admitted of indefinite\r\nextension, and the stage which they had reached by the date of the\r\naccession of Vespasian is partially known to us from the only official\r\ndocument which throws light on the powers of the early Principate. In\r\nthe existing fragment of this charter, which appears to be a decree\r\nof the Senate meant to be submitted to the people for their formal\r\nassent,[1588] we find the Emperor credited with the heterogeneous powers\r\nof making treaties, extending the _pomerium_, commending candidates for\r\nmagistracies, and issuing edicts as interpretations of law human and\r\ndivine. The measure further exempts him from the operation of certain\r\nenactments and gives him certain privileges, not possessed by the other\r\nmagistrates, in his relations with the Senate. These powers cannot be\r\nbrought under any single legal designation; but, as most of them are\r\nmore or less directly connected with some kind of _imperium_, the view\r\nthat they were tacked on to the bill conferring the tribunician power,\r\nwhich received the formal ratification of the Plebs, is improbable. On\r\nthe other hand, they cannot be said to have belonged originally to a\r\nlaw conferring the _imperium_; for the imperial biographies frequently\r\nspeak of the gift of the _proconsulare imperium_ (by the Senate) and\r\nof the _tribunicia potestas_ (by Senate and People) without any hint\r\nof a general law conferring _the_ “imperium.”[1589] Yet the gift of\r\nthe _imperium_ is sometimes mentioned,[1590] and if the passages of\r\njurists of the second and third centuries, which speak of _imperium_\r\nbeing conferred through a _lex_,[1591] are genuine, we must conclude\r\nthat the centre of gravity in the powers of the Princeps had shifted\r\nwith the course of years. Originally the casual collection of powers,\r\nwhich appears in the law sanctioning Vespasian’s rule, must have been a\r\nmere supplement to the two leading prerogatives—the proconsular and the\r\ntribunician powers. But it is quite possible that in the course of time\r\nthe vast development and the great importance of these added privileges\r\nmay have caused the enactment containing them, now known as the _lex de\r\nimperio_, to overshadow the other sources of the imperial authority.\r\n\r\nThere was one source, however, most distinctively expressive of the\r\ncharacter of the Principate, which found no expression in legal\r\nenactments. The military oath (_sacramentum_), which during the closing\r\nyears of the Republic was tending to become a bond of personal allegiance\r\nbetween a legion and its chief, was naturally taken in the Principate\r\nby the whole army to its sole commander.[1592] But on the very first\r\ntransference of the throne a new departure was made. At the accession\r\nof Tiberius the oath of fealty was taken voluntarily by the civil\r\norders;[1593] it was administered by provincial governors and was renewed\r\ntwice a year, on the first of January and on the anniversary of the\r\nEmperor’s accession.[1594] The fact that a soldier’s oath bound the whole\r\nRoman world was the fittest expression of the military character of the\r\nnew despotism.\r\n\r\nA classification of the Emperor’s powers in detail, with an attempt to\r\ndeduce each of them from a prerogative conferred on him at his accession,\r\nis rendered difficult by the facts that no Roman lawyer cared or dared\r\nto evolve a complete theory of the Imperial constitution, and that here,\r\nas in so many other departments of Roman history, we are dealing with an\r\noffice which, as it grew, gradually absorbed into itself fresh spheres\r\nof influence. The Principate, in fact, finally absorbed the state, and\r\nthe only adequate formula for its authority which later jurists could\r\nfind was that the people had committed its sovereign power to its\r\ndelegate. But yet, when we examine the spheres of the Emperor’s activity,\r\nit becomes clear that, while some are connected with an _imperium_,\r\nothers are attached more closely to the tribunician power, while others\r\nagain are associated with the relics of Republican offices held by the\r\nPrinceps, or flow from certain extraordinary rights conferred on him by\r\nstatute.\r\n\r\n(i.) The first rights connected with the _imperium_ that strike our\r\nattention are those exercised in the military sphere—rights which,\r\non a vast scale, reflect and extend the powers possessed by the\r\n_imperator_ of the Republic. The Princeps has the right to raise\r\nlevies,[1595] to nominate officers, and to confer military distinctions.\r\nIn declaring war he has replaced the comitia of the centuries; and the\r\nstatutory recognition of his right to conclude a treaty[1596] settled\r\na vexed question of Republican procedure.[1597] This recognition\r\nof the federative power was not earlier than the reign of the first\r\nClaudius,[1598] but had already become a permanent element in the\r\nimperial authority by the accession of Vespasian. The right to extend the\r\n_pomerium_ of the city, which dates also from the reign of Claudius, is\r\nalso found amongst the list of imperial prerogatives in 69 A.D.[1599]\r\n\r\nThe Republican general had often followed up a successful campaign by\r\nassigning lands and planting colonies. These acts had been done at\r\nthe mandate of the people; but the new commander-in-chief needed no\r\nsuch permit. The Princeps divides territories that belong to the Roman\r\npeople and establishes colonial settlements at his will. The gift\r\nof the franchise had also been entrusted at times to the Republican\r\ncommander,[1600] and now it is placed wholly in the hands of the Emperor.\r\nHe grants these gifts both to communities and to individuals. He gives\r\nLatin rights to _peregrinae civitates_,[1601] and citizenship to Latin\r\ntowns, while he may alter the nominal _status_ of a community by changing\r\na _municipium_ into a colony, or a colony into a _municipium_.[1602]\r\nHis right of conferring citizenship on individuals was equally\r\nunquestioned,[1603] and he might remedy the defect of birth by giving\r\n_ingenuitas_ to a freedman.[1604]\r\n\r\nWith the _imperium_ too is obviously connected the administration of\r\nthose provinces which were peculiarly entrusted to the care of the\r\nPrinceps. The government of these provinces, as well as the maintenance\r\nof the army, necessitated a financial administration, separate from that\r\nof the state and peculiar to himself, and this was accompanied by a right\r\nof coinage. His criminal and civil jurisdiction over citizens as well as\r\nsoldiers are also connected with some undefined idea of the _imperium_,\r\nwhile his power of legal interpretation, although specially conferred,\r\ndoes not differ essentially from that of the praetor, and is to be traced\r\nto the same source. The detailed consideration of these powers must be\r\ndeferred until we treat of that separation of authority between Caesar\r\nand the Senate which gave its formal character to the Principate.\r\n\r\n(ii.) The _tribunicia potestas_, which had been granted to Augustus\r\nin 36, reconferred in 30, and made the chief outward support of his\r\nauthority in 23 B.C.,[1605] continued to serve the Emperors as the\r\nostensible means by which all other magistracies were subject to their\r\ncontrol,[1606] and possessed an artificial prominence from its employment\r\nas a means of dating the years of their reign. Positively it conferred\r\nthe _sacrosanctitas_, which had encompassed the Republican tribune,[1607]\r\nthe right of approaching the assembly of the Plebs, which was of value as\r\nlong as the Emperors deigned to legislate through popular channels, and\r\nperhaps the only strictly constitutional power which they possessed of\r\ntransacting business with the Senate.[1608] But its negative were now,\r\nas ever, of more value than its positive powers. The _intercessio_ made\r\nits possessor the moderator of the state,[1609] and the severest means\r\nof tribunician coercion could be employed against every recalcitrant\r\nofficial; while this veto, when used in the Senate, became either\r\na means of suspending the jurisdiction of that body or a method of\r\npardoning the criminal whom it had condemned.[1610] The right of help\r\n(_auxilium_)[1611] based on the appeal (_appellatio_) becomes also, as\r\nwe shall see, one of the means of establishing the first true appellate\r\njurisdiction which the Roman world had seen.\r\n\r\n(iii.) With respect to other Republican offices in which the Princeps\r\nwas directly interested, we have only to consider the consulship and\r\nthe censorship, for they were the only two whose titles or powers were\r\nsufficient to warrant their assumption by the head of the state.\r\n\r\nThe consulship was no integral part of the imperial power after Augustus\r\nhad ceased to employ it in this way;[1612] but it was frequently assumed\r\nas an occasional office by the Princeps, who held it for a short time,\r\ngenerally at the beginning of his rule.\r\n\r\nThe censorship had disappeared as a Republican office, and we might have\r\nexpected that its vast powers combined with its Republican traditions\r\nwould have made it a valuable supplement to the authority of the Prince.\r\nBut there were reasons against its assumption. In its pure form it was an\r\noccasional office, and its permanent tenure might have shocked Republican\r\nsentiment; while the fact that the assessment of the Roman people for\r\nthe _comitia_ and the army soon ceased to be necessary made its absence\r\nscarcely felt. On the analogy of the _tribunicia potestas_, the powers of\r\nthe office without the office itself were, in the form of a _cura legum\r\net morum_, offered to Augustus, but declined by him.[1613] There was no\r\nconstitutional difficulty about exercising some of the functions of the\r\ncensorship through the _imperium_, whether consular or quasi-consular,\r\nand this was done by Augustus when he revised the list of the Senate in\r\n29 and 18 B.C.[1614] Two of the succeeding Principes, however, Claudius\r\nand Vespasian, thought fit to assume the office in its old temporary\r\nform, and Domitian carried out the design of making it an integral part\r\nof the Principate by assuming the position of censor for life (_censor\r\nperpetuus_).[1615] His precedent was not followed because it was\r\nunnecessary. The revision of the list of the Senate and _equites_—the\r\nonly meaning that the _cura morum_ now had—was established by consent\r\nas an admitted right of the Princeps,[1616] and even the power of\r\ncreating Patricians came to be recognised as one inherent in his office.\r\nThis power had been conferred on Caesar and Augustus by law; Claudius\r\nand Vespasian exercised it as censors;[1617] but, apparently without\r\nfurther enactment, this power of ennobling, extinct since the beginning\r\nof the Republic[1618] and no part of the Republican census, became an\r\nadmitted imperial prerogative. It was only when the destined Princeps was\r\nhimself a Plebeian that this honour, which was considered a necessary\r\nqualification for his office, was conferred on him by the Senate.[1619]\r\n\r\n(iv.) The chief of the extraordinary rights conferred on the Princeps by\r\nspecial enactment were those which had relation to the Senate, the right\r\nof recommendation to office (_commendatio_) and a dispensation from the\r\noperation of certain laws.\r\n\r\nThe special privileges which distinguished the Emperor from other\r\nmagistrates in transacting business with the Senate were three in\r\nnumber. First, he has not merely the power to put a motion (_referre_)\r\nwhen present in the house, but he can send a written recommendation\r\n(_relationem facere_) when the Senate meets under the presidency of\r\nanother magistrate.[1620] In such a meeting the Emperor as a rule\r\nonly claims priority for one item in a single sitting (_jus primae\r\nrelationis_); hence we sometimes find, as a special privilege, the right\r\nof priority given him for three, four, or five.[1621] The power which he\r\npossesses of dividing the house upon his motion without debate (_senatus\r\nconsultum per discessionem facere_) is not a new one, but one that\r\nmight be exercised by the consul of the later Republic. Secondly, the\r\nEmperor has the power to withdraw a _relatio_ of his own which is already\r\nbefore the house (_relationem remittere_); and thirdly, the privilege of\r\nordering the Senate to meet under the presidency of another magistrate.\r\n\r\nThe second special right has reference to the elections of magistrates,\r\nand introduces us to the question how far the Princeps could control\r\nthem. Two functions are attributed to him by our authorities, that of\r\nnomination and that of commendation; but the effects of the two are very\r\ndifferent. The _nominatio_ is merely the negative power possessed by\r\nthe Republican magistrate of receiving names and excluding unqualified\r\naspirants from candidature. With respect to most offices—the praetorship,\r\nfor instance—it was exercised by the Princeps conjointly with the\r\nconsuls, and the number of candidates whom he nominated was, at least in\r\nthe early Principate, limited.[1622] The practical effect of the Prince’s\r\nnomination on the election might be great, but its legal influence was\r\n_nil_.[1623] _Commendatio_, on the other hand, a privilege developed\r\nfrom the Republican practice by which candidates were recommended by\r\ndistinguished persons for election, is a right legally conferred, and one\r\nwhich absolutely secures the choice by the electing body of the person\r\nso commended.[1624] The extent to which it might be employed differed\r\nwith the various magistracies; thus in Tiberius’ reign, out of at least\r\ntwelve candidates for the praetorship only four were commended by the\r\nEmperor.[1625] Magistrates, who had gained their position by this act of\r\nimperial favour, were designated _candidati Caesaris_.[1626] The highest\r\noffice of all, the consulship, seems, at least in the early Principate,\r\nnever to have been awarded on a formal imperial recommendation; for the\r\ndescription of the method by which Tiberius filled up this post at his\r\npleasure shows that the Emperor effected his object by a clever use of\r\nthe nomination.[1627] This may have been a limitation of practice, not\r\nof theory, for the words of the law as we have it exempt no office from\r\nthis imperial control, and it is certain that from the time of Vespasian\r\nonwards the consulship too was subject to the _commendatio_.[1628]\r\n\r\nThe Princeps, according to the enactment which confers powers on\r\nVespasian, was dispensed from certain laws (_legibus solutus_).[1629]\r\nThere is no implication here of an exemption from the operation of the\r\nordinary civil and criminal law. The Princeps is not above the laws, nor\r\nare the courts of the community his courts; and, if he was exempt from\r\nprosecution during his year of office, this was the normal privilege of\r\nthe Republican magistrate. What is meant is the dispensation from certain\r\nprinciples of the constitution or enactments, which the Principate as\r\na magistracy necessarily violated or which were found inconvenient to\r\nthe Princeps. Such were the _leges annales_, or the rule forbidding the\r\nholding of the _imperium_ within the walls. In choosing an heir the\r\nEmperor was also exempted from following the precise formalities of\r\nadrogation;[1630] he could manumit without the _vindicta_[1631] and was\r\nnot subject to the disabilities of the Julian and Papian law.[1632]\r\n\r\n(v.) The separation of religious from political duties, which had been\r\na characteristic of the Republic, was continued theoretically under\r\nthe Principate. The Emperor was in no sense a high priest, and ritual\r\nwas still a function of the sacerdotal colleges. But he was a member\r\nof the great religious guilds which dealt with augury and with the\r\n_jus divinum_,[1633] and the law gives him the power to carry out the\r\norders of such societies if he thinks it to be in the interest of the\r\nstate.[1634] We have not, however, merely the phenomenon of the civil\r\nassisting the religious arm, for the Prince, as _pontifex maximus_,\r\nrepresents both in his own person. The chief pontificate was specially\r\nconferred on him with the other imperial powers; he may originally have\r\nbeen invested, like the pontifex of the Republic, by the assembly of\r\nthe seventeen tribes,[1635] but later the creation seems to have been\r\nwholly the work of the Senate, although a formal announcement of the\r\nresult (_renuntiatio_) was still made before the assembly.[1636] When the\r\nPrincipate came to admit the principle of colleagueship, only one of the\r\nAugusti was made chief pontiff,[1637] and the association of the highest\r\nreligious and civil power continued until the stole was rejected by the\r\npiety of Gratian.[1638]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the attempt to keep the rôles of pontiff and Princeps\r\napart, even if made, could never have been successful. Where crime was\r\nalso sin the pontiff could now utter authoritative law and exercise\r\ncoercion; the lay and the religious character are strangely mixed in the\r\nmethods adopted by Domitian for the punishment of incest,[1639] and when\r\nthe _jussio principis_ speaks on a question of burial law,[1640] it must\r\nhave been difficult to tell whether it was the Prince or the pontiff who\r\nwas giving his decision.\r\n\r\nApart from its influence on law, the chief pontificate was valuable for\r\nits powers of patronage. Few distinctions were more earnestly sought by\r\nyoung nobles than admission to the religious colleges, and the door to\r\nthem lay chiefly through the Princeps. His influence might be exercised\r\nby his right of nomination or by his commendation to the electing\r\nbody.[1641]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. _Titles, Insignia, and Honours of the Princeps_\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the titles of the Princeps, it is as well to begin with\r\nthose which were not in the list of official titles, for, impressed on\r\nthe ruler, as they were, by current usage, they were often the most\r\nsignificant. The word _Princeps_, although it described no office or\r\npeculiar authority, was yet a semi-official designation; even as employed\r\nin the later Republic it had signified a political pre-eminence over\r\nother citizens,[1642] and now it denoted not so much the “chief citizen”\r\nas the “head” or “chief man” in the state, the director of the Republic,\r\nto whom all looked for guidance, who was responsible for its failures\r\nand credited with its successes, even when these were the result of the\r\nactions of other magistrates.[1643] It was above all a title which tended\r\nto emphasise the continuance of the life of the Republican government\r\nunder the new _régime_, and suggested a mental contrast, at once to the\r\nEmperor’s position as the commander of his legions, expressed in the\r\ntitle _imperator_, and to that absolute headship which, as exercised in\r\nfamily life at Rome, was known as _dominium_.[1644] The name, indeed,\r\nof _dominus_ inspired such a horror in the mind of Augustus that he\r\ndisliked this mode of address (a familiar one from the members of a\r\nfamily to its head) to be employed even by his sons and grandsons,[1645]\r\nand Tiberius insisted that he was _dominus_ only to his slaves.[1646] But\r\nthe language of courtly life, perhaps at times of real affection, forced\r\nthe title into use, and the younger Pliny employs it constantly in his\r\ncorrespondence with Trajan. It is not, however, until the time of Severus\r\nthat it appears on the public addresses of corporations, and Aurelian is\r\nthe first emperor who is _dominus_ on his coins.[1647] It is probable\r\nthat these niceties of western nomenclature were always lost on the\r\noriental mind. To it the Principate is a monarchy, and Caesar, when he is\r\nnot a god, is either αὐτοκράτωρ or βασιλεύς.\r\n\r\nIf we turn now to the titular designation of the Princeps, we find that\r\nthis consists partly of titles of office, partly of those of honour.\r\nThe word _imperator_ occupies a doubtful place between the two; for\r\nwhile denoting no office, it signifies the possession of an active and\r\nuntrammelled _imperium_. It occupies a twofold place in the list of\r\ntitles. Augustus employed it as a _praenomen_, perhaps in accordance\r\nwith the view that he had inherited the title from his uncle, who had\r\nborne it (apparently as a _cognomen_[1648]) during the later years of his\r\nlife, and as a _praenomen_ it was used by most succeeding emperors.[1649]\r\nBut it appears a second time in the titular designation of the Princeps\r\nwith its old Republican significance—that of an appellation borne by a\r\ncommander who had been acclaimed after a victory.[1650] As so employed\r\nit was qualified by numerals to mark the number of the salutations;\r\namongst these was reckoned that which had acclaimed him Emperor, and,\r\nconsequently, after the first victory won under his auspices, he appears\r\nas _imperator II_.\r\n\r\nA more distinctive title of office is that of _proconsul_. Although\r\nit merely expresses the fact of a _proconsulate imperium_, it was a\r\ndesignation that was avoided by the early Principes, probably out of\r\ndeference to the senatorial administration of the public provinces, which\r\nwas exercised through proconsuls, and it was first employed by Trajan.\r\nIts employment hints at the practical disappearance of the dual control\r\nabroad, and suggests the all-embracing nature of the Emperor’s _imperium_.\r\n\r\nAmongst the honorary appellations of the Emperor, _Caesar_ and _Augustus_\r\ntake the foremost place. The latter, although appended to the Emperor’s\r\nname like a _cognomen_, was never looked on as a family designation. It\r\nwas the highest of all personal titles of honour, since it expressed the\r\nsanctified majesty of the Prince alone,[1651] and was not borne even by\r\nthat subordinate partner on the throne (_consors imperii_), the holder\r\nof the _proconsulate imperium_ or _tribunicia potestas_, through whose\r\nassistance the earlier emperors sometimes lightened the burden of their\r\nadministration. It was not until the collegiate principle was fully\r\nrecognised in 161 A.D. that the _duo Augusti_ appear.\r\n\r\n_Caesar_, on the other hand, was in origin purely a family designation,\r\nsince it was the hereditary _cognomen_ of that branch of the Julian\r\nhouse which had ascended the throne, and all the emperors to Caligula\r\ncould claim a legitimate right to it whether by descent or adoption.\r\nEven Claudius and Nero, connected as they were with the extinct family\r\nof Caesars, might use it with some show of family right. It is only with\r\nGalba and his successors that _Caesar_ becomes strictly an appellative;\r\nit is an assertion of a fictitious dynastic claim such as that which led\r\nthe princes of the house of Emesa to adopt the revered name of Antoninus,\r\nand may be indirectly connected with a claim to succeed to the crown\r\nproperty.[1652] The name, even when thus artificially employed, continued\r\nto be a _cognomen_; it was shared by the ruling Princeps with his sons\r\nand grandsons.\r\n\r\nWith Hadrian’s reign we find the beginning of a limitation of its use.\r\nThe Caesar is now the presumptive successor to the throne;[1653] the\r\nelective monarchy has been recognised as one that is, if not hereditary,\r\nat least capable of transmission through nomination, and the choice of\r\nthe bearer of the name is made by the reigning Emperor, although it\r\nmay be suggested by the Senate.[1654] After the beginning of the third\r\ncentury the name appears as _nobilissimus Caesar_, Geta being the first\r\nprince to bear this title. The recognition of the dual monarchy rendered\r\nit inevitable that two Caesars might be simultaneously designated for the\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\nOther honorary _cognomina_, such as _Germanicus_, _Pius_, _Felix_, were,\r\neven when transmitted, purely personal, although their adoption was now\r\nreserved for the Emperor, and such designations were no longer borne by\r\nthe other nobles in the state. The designation _pater patriae_ has more\r\ndistinct reference to the political position of the Princeps. A title\r\nonce conferred by popular acclamation on Cicero, it is now equally in\r\nthe gift of the people as represented by the Senate. As its conferment\r\nwas not necessary to the powers of the Principate, the grant of this\r\ndesignation, however much it might be the result of flattery, was always\r\nregarded as the reward of merit.[1655]\r\n\r\nThe order of the imperial titles admits of variations, but, as finally\r\nfixed, was usually _pontifex maximus_, _tribunicia potestate_ (II. III.\r\netc.), _imperator_ (II. III. etc.), _consul_ (II. III. etc.), _censor_\r\n(when this office was assumed, as it was by Claudius, Vespasian, Titus\r\nand Domitian), _proconsul_ (a title adopted by Trajan and occupying the\r\nlast place after the reign of Hadrian).[1656]\r\n\r\nThe usual _insignia_ of the Princeps are those of a Republican\r\nmagistrate. Within the walls he wears the scarlet-striped gown (_toga\r\npraetexta_); outside them he may don the scarlet _paludamentum_. But the\r\nlaurel crown, which he might wear anywhere and at any time,[1657] and\r\nthe laurel-wreathed _fasces_[1658] are peculiar to him. At festivals and\r\ngames the embroidered robe of triumph (_vestis triumphalis_) might also\r\nbe assumed. Like other magistrates he has lictors[1659] and _viatores_,\r\nbut he also boasts a special bodyguard as well, other than the praetorian\r\ncohorts. This guard was composed of mounted foreign mercenaries, usually\r\nof German horsemen.\r\n\r\nBut other peculiar honours seemed to lift the Princeps to more than\r\nmagisterial rank. Regular vows (_vota_) were offered for him, as for the\r\nstate,[1660] by the consuls and the colleges of priests; his birthday and\r\nthe days of his victories were celebrated as public festivals;[1661] his\r\nstatue and image are sacred and may not be profaned even by juxtaposition\r\nwith unclean things;[1662] his _genius_ is the most binding power by\r\nwhich a man can swear; for while perjury in the name of the gods is\r\npunished only by heaven, to swear falsely by the Emperor’s name is\r\ntreason on earth.[1663] Coins, whether struck by the Senate or the\r\nEmperor, show only his head or that of members of the imperial house.\r\n\r\nThe _domus Caesaris_ was, in fact, raised far above the position of\r\nthe other noble houses in the state. It was especially the agnatic\r\ndescendants of the founder of the dynasty that were thus honoured, and\r\nthe Roman idea of the unity of the household even led to the inclusion\r\nof the name of Caesar’s relatives in the soldier’s oath of fealty.[1664]\r\nTheir effigies, too, appear on coins—a right originally restricted\r\nto such members of the family as actually shared in the government,\r\nbut which was in later times granted as a compliment to ladies of the\r\nimperial house.[1665] Caesar’s relatives might also be distinguished by\r\ncommands which could be interpreted as a promise of the succession. We\r\nshall speak elsewhere of this meaning which might be read into the gift\r\nof the proconsular or tribunician power, and almost equally significant\r\nwas the appointment of some young member of the family to the honorary\r\ncommand of the corps of _equites_ (_princeps juventutis_).[1666] There\r\nwas, indeed, one title which seemed to signify a dignity absolutely equal\r\nto that of the Princeps himself. This was the name _Augusta_, which\r\nwas borne by certain ladies of the ruling family. It was originally\r\nreserved for a single member, such as the mother, the grandmother, or\r\nthe wife of the reigning Emperor, and may have originally implied some\r\nshare in the throne. The Principate was not a regular magistracy, and\r\nthere was no valid constitutional ground for excluding women from the\r\nthrone, although the actual influence of queen-mothers, such as Livia,\r\nAgrippina, or Mamaea, however powerful it may have been, was wholly\r\ninformal.[1667] The name _Augusta_ came, however, to be employed merely\r\nas an honorary designation, to be borne by such a woman as Marciana, the\r\nunaspiring sister of Trajan.[1668] A stranger title was developed by the\r\nambition of ladies of the second and third century. Faustina, wife of\r\nMarcus Aurelius, and Julia Domna, wife of Septimius Severus, were both\r\ndesignated “mothers of the camp” (_mater castrorum_). One important and\r\ndisastrous result of this elevation of the imperial house was that its\r\nmembers were protected, like its head, against all the attacks of _laesa\r\nmajestas_. As even the most indirect reflection on the Princeps was\r\ntreason, because he represented the state, a similar view was taken of\r\nconstructive wrongs to members of the imperial family, because they were\r\none with the Princeps. This view was too purely Roman to need time to\r\ndevelop. Even in the reign of the second Princeps we find that a poet has\r\nto expiate by death the folly of an obituary poem on the Emperor’s living\r\nson.[1669]\r\n\r\nAs the Princeps was not a king he had no court, and “Augustus or Trajan\r\nwould have blushed at employing the meanest of the Romans in those menial\r\noffices which, in the household and bedchamber of a limited monarch,\r\nare so eagerly solicited by the proudest nobles of Britain.”[1670]\r\nYet, although the _entourage_ of the early Principes was simplicity\r\nitself, the stately life of the Republican noble had already furnished\r\nprecedents for distinguishing the grades and privileges of those who\r\nsought the Emperor’s presence. The younger Gracchus and Livius Drusus\r\nhad, at the daily _salutatio_, drawn distinctions amongst their numerous\r\nadherents; at the morning audience some were received singly, others in\r\nlarger or in smaller groups;[1671] and it is not surprising that this\r\ndistinction should have been revived for the great throng of callers who\r\nfilled the hall of the imperial palace. The _amici_ of the Princeps were\r\nthose “received at court,” and were divided into friends of the first\r\nand second “audience.”[1672] From this body were selected the judicial\r\nand administrative advisers of the Emperor (_consilium_) as well as\r\nthe comrades (_comites_) whom he took with him when he quitted Italy\r\non business of state. From the latter, who consisted of senators or\r\nknights, he selected a group for a special journey,[1673] and employed\r\nthem as delegates in matters administrative, judicial, and military.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. _Creation, Transmission, and Abrogation of the Principate_\r\n\r\nThe Principate was, in the theory of the constitution, an elective\r\noffice, and one based on the principle of occasional delegation.\r\nIt was necessary for the life of the state that there should be a\r\nmagistracy,[1674] but it was not necessary that there should be a\r\nPrinceps. Hence there was no institution such as the Republican\r\n_interregnum_ to fill up the gap left by the vacancy of the throne,[1675]\r\nand the fact that such gaps did occur in the history of the Principate\r\nshows that the possibility of government by magistrates, senate, and\r\npeople was no mere fiction. The abstract idea of a Principate was indeed\r\nperfectly realised at the death of the very first Princeps, in so far\r\nas responsible men in the Roman world had a perfectly definite idea of\r\nthe precise powers that must be vested in an individual in order to save\r\nthat world from anarchy. Yet Tiberius can pretend to hesitate, not merely\r\nabout assuming the office, but about the nature of the office which he\r\nassumes;[1676] and, although on the accession of his successor, Gaius\r\nCaesar, the _soliti honores_ were conferred _en bloc_, yet the idea that\r\nthe creation of a Princeps was an act of special investiture always clung\r\nto the office. It was obvious so far as the choice of the person was\r\nconcerned, but it even affected the powers conferred, and we have seen\r\nthat the grants made to Emperors of the second and third centuries were\r\nin all probability different, both in form and in matter, from those made\r\nto Emperors of the first.[1677]\r\n\r\nThe electing body was the Roman people, chiefly represented by the Senate\r\nbut still retaining in its own hands the formal ratification of most of\r\nthe powers conferred. But the powerlessness of this sovereign is of the\r\nvery essence of the history of the Principate. As a rule, all that it\r\ncan do is to recognise an _imperium_ already established by the army,\r\nwhether this establishment be due to the tacit consent of praetorians or\r\nlegionaries or to the active use of their swords. The crucial point in\r\nthe creation of an emperor is his salutation by his army as _imperator_.\r\nSuch a salutation did not mean that the general who accepted it was\r\nPrinceps; it meant only that he was a candidate for the Principate.\r\nThe act itself was one of revolution; its legality depended upon its\r\nsuccess. Did the legions in other provinces accept the candidature, the\r\nSenate immediately fulfilled its formal task; did rival aspirants meet\r\nin battle, it was always ready to welcome the survivor. To be truly\r\na Princeps was to receive the customary honours and offices from the\r\nSenate, and Vitellius was acting in the true spirit of the constitution\r\nwhen he adopted as the formal date of his accession (_dies imperii_) the\r\nday on which his claims had been ratified by the fathers.[1678] Vespasian\r\nwas acting contrary to that spirit when he regarded as the beginning of\r\nhis the moment at which he had been saluted _imperator_ by the legions of\r\nEgypt.[1679]\r\n\r\nYet although the history of the Empire furnishes an unparalleled series\r\nof successful revolutions, it must not be supposed that the importance\r\nof the Senate’s formally transmitting the succession was ever questioned\r\nor obscured. The Senate’s authority was rendered stable by the many\r\npeaceful instances of dynastic succession; it was rendered creditable\r\nby such a stand as that made against the tyrant Maximin; it was kept\r\nalive by the fact that when, in the days of the “thirty tyrants,” the\r\nEmpire was breaking up, Italy was still the only formal centre of a world\r\npower; it was bound up with the magic name of Rome, and even in the third\r\ncentury was welcomed with relief by an army sick of its own lawless\r\nviolence.[1680]\r\n\r\nBut whether we lay more stress on the _de facto_ or the _de jure_ element\r\nin the act of election, we must admit that the elective principle was\r\nnot the sole determinant in the transmission of the Principate. It was\r\ncrossed by two others, both of which were typically Roman. These were the\r\nprinciples of nomination and of hereditary succession.\r\n\r\nNomination took the form of designation by some significant act. One\r\nof the most significant modes in which the Princeps could point to his\r\nchoice of a successor was to invest an individual with an approximation\r\nto those powers which were of the essence of the Principate, and thus\r\nto make him in a sense a colleague in the Empire (_collega_, _consors\r\nimperii_). The powers chosen were the _proconsulare imperium_, the\r\n_tribunicia potestas_, or both. It was thus that Augustus at different\r\ntimes designated Agrippa and Tiberius for the throne,[1681] that Tiberius\r\npointed to Germanicus and Drusus as his destined successors, that\r\nNerva nominated Trajan, Trajan Pius, and Pius Marcus Aurelius.[1682]\r\nAlthough such a position is described as one of colleagueship in the\r\nimperial power, yet it did not confer, as regards the _imperium_, the\r\nmost characteristic rights of the Principate. The colleague did not\r\npossess joint command over the praetorian guard or the fleet, nor joint\r\nadministration over all the Caesarian provinces,[1683] unless these\r\nrights were conferred by special mandate, as they were on Tiberius\r\nduring the closing years of Augustus’ life;[1684] nor had the colleague,\r\nalthough in possession of an independent _imperium_, any right to\r\ntriumph, except by the will of the Princeps,[1685] for his victory had\r\nbeen due to legions which had taken the _sacramentum_ to another. The\r\nname _imperator_ was not borne by this assistant to the throne unless it\r\nwas specially conferred, as it was by Vespasian on Titus and by Hadrian\r\non Antoninus Pius.[1686] It is uncertain whether the possessor of the\r\n_tribunicia potestas_ and of the _proconsulare imperium_ in its lower\r\nform had to have these powers reconferred on his accession to the throne.\r\nIn the case of the _imperium_, since it fell short of that required for\r\nthe imperial position, reconferment is probable. But yet the possession\r\nof such a power seemed to create a continuity in the Principate, and the\r\nstate seemed never to have lost its head.\r\n\r\nA second mode of nomination was effected by the Princeps designating\r\nhis intended successor as his heir. It was not merely that this was\r\nan effective way of showing one’s will, but it actually pointed to a\r\ntransmission of the crown property (_patrimonium_) which accompanied the\r\nPrincipate. Gaius attempted to employ this mode of designation in favour\r\nof his sister Drusilla,[1687] and Tiberius showed either that he had\r\nleft the succession open, or that he contemplated a joint Augustate, by\r\nmaking his great-nephew Gaius and his grandson Tiberius Gemellus joint\r\nheirs.[1688]\r\n\r\nAdoption was as effective a means of emphasising one’s intentions. Such\r\nan adoption by the Princeps might be by testament, but it need not follow\r\nthe legal forms, and required only a public announcement through a\r\n_contio_ whether in the Forum, the Senate, or the camp.[1689] It was thus\r\nthat Galba named Piso as his successor, but adoption usually accompanied\r\nthe gift of quasi-imperial power, as in the cases of Tiberius, Trajan,\r\nAntoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius.[1690]\r\n\r\nWe have already noticed the method by which the Princeps, sometimes with\r\nthe help of the Senate, could announce his wishes as to the succession\r\nby the gift of the name of Caesar.[1691] This was a constitutional\r\nrecognition of a principle of designation which had hitherto been\r\ninformal.\r\n\r\nThree of the modes of nomination which we have mentioned—those by\r\nheirship, adoption, and the gift of the name of Caesar—obviously approach\r\nvery closely to the principle of hereditary succession. Adoption\r\nespecially created to the Roman mind a tie only less strong than that of\r\nnatural birth; and, whichever of the three methods was employed, it would\r\nhave been considered almost inconceivable that a man should pass over\r\nhis own son or agnatic descendant in favour of a stranger. Just as in\r\nthe Republic son had succeeded father in office, so in the Principate it\r\nwas easy to gain recognition for a dynasty; and, as a rule, it was only\r\nwhen the last of a line had, for misgovernment or other reasons, been\r\nviolently overthrown, that the principle of selection found free play.\r\nThe magic of the name of Caesar could call even Claudius to the throne;\r\nVespasian, the _novus homo_, found it easy to transmit his power; the\r\ndynasty founded by Severus ran through four generations in spite of the\r\nmurder of Caracalla and the scandal of Elagabalus’ rule; the death of the\r\ntwo elder Gordians made the accession of the third inevitable; and Carus,\r\nthe last of the rough soldier emperors, could be succeeded by the gentle\r\nNumerian and the extravagant Carinus.\r\n\r\nThe lack of any definite principle of succession combined with the\r\nwarring forces within the Empire to make the position of a ruling Emperor\r\none of dazzling uncertainty. The possibility of election by the legions\r\ncreated a rude standard of merit, and it is questionable whether any\r\nreally incapable man ever sat on the Roman throne. But usurpation was\r\noften followed by dethronement, tyranny by death or posthumous disgrace;\r\nand although such expulsions, executions, and censures were practically\r\nthe work of the army, it is of some importance for the constitutional\r\ntheory of the Principate to determine the legal form which dethronement\r\nor condemnation assumed.\r\n\r\nAs it was the Senate, representing the people, which gave, so it was\r\nthis power which took away the Principate; and the act of deposition\r\nis attested in the cases of Nero, Didius Julianus, and Maximin.[1692]\r\nDeposition was followed by death, and then came the condemnation of the\r\nreign, one that might follow even when the death of the tyrant had not\r\nbeen directly ordered by the government.[1693] In its extremest form this\r\nwas a condemnation of the memory (_damnatio memoriae_) of the late ruler\r\non the ground that he was a traitor (_perduellis_).[1694] His _acta_ were\r\nrescinded, his name erased from the records. A milder form of censure was\r\nthe mere neglect of his _acta_ in the form that no oath to observe them\r\nwas sworn by magistrates and senators.[1695] In the latter case there was\r\nno wholesale rescission of the acts, and each special case in which the\r\nlate Emperor had decided was approved on its individual merits.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the acceptance of a reign took the twofold form of\r\nan oath to observe the _acta_ of the dead Emperor[1696] and a vote to\r\nassign him a place amongst the deified Caesars. The prospect of this\r\nposthumous recognition of the merits of a reign must often have exercised\r\na stimulating influence on the occupant of the throne,[1697] although it\r\nwas somewhat spoilt by the consciousness that the decision of the Senate\r\nwould, to a large extent, be guided by the wishes of his successor in\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4. _The other Powers in the State—the Magistracy, the Comitia, and the\r\nSenate_\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) _The Magistracy_\r\n\r\nAs the Republican constitution continued in form unimpaired, so its most\r\nessential feature, the magistracy, although subjected to modification,\r\nwas still an integral element in the administration of Rome and Italy\r\nduring the Principate. Few radical differences were introduced into the\r\nmagisterial qualifications or career; the innovations affected only the\r\nage for office, the starting point in the _cursus honorum_, and one\r\nof the steps in the _certus ordo magistratuum_. The minimum age for\r\nthe quaestorship was now twenty-five years,[1698] for the praetorship\r\nthirty,[1699] and two new qualifications were necessary before the\r\nquaestorship could be held. One was membership of the vigintivirate, the\r\naggregate of lower magistracies to which the _sex-et-vigintiviratus_\r\nof the Republic had now shrunk.[1700] The other, perhaps originally\r\na practical rather than a legal qualification, was the tenure of the\r\nmilitary tribunate,[1701] the latter being held generally after one\r\nof the magistracies in the vigintivirate had been administered. This\r\nchange, though apparently formal, meant a fundamental alteration in the\r\nspirit of the new nobility. The possibilities of culture, to be acquired\r\nin the schools of Athens and Rhodes, were now almost extinct. From the\r\nage of eighteen the aspirant to the highest honours in the State might\r\nbe serving with Caesar’s legions on the frontier. It was through the\r\nEmperor’s grace that he attained a military position which was at least\r\na practically necessary qualification for the magistracy; at the age of\r\ntwenty-five the young soldier entered on the race for higher honours;\r\nas an ex-praetor, even at times as an ex-quaestor, he might be made\r\nthe general of a brigade (_legatus legionis_), and from thence proceed\r\nto the government of a military, or the administration of a civil,\r\nprovince. Nothing shows more clearly the true military character of the\r\nnew monarchy than the fact that even its civil and Republican posts\r\nwere administered by soldiers; nothing explains more adequately the\r\nsubservience of the Senate than the fact that it was composed mainly of\r\nex-officers, trained in the habits of rigid obedience and in unwavering\r\nrespect to the _sacramentum_—of men to whom Caesar was not Princeps but\r\nImperator.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the steps in office which followed the quaestorship,\r\na further change was due to the unwillingness of candidates to burden\r\nthemselves with the aedileship, now that its powers of bribery were of no\r\navail, and with the now undistinguished tribunate of the Plebs. The rule\r\nwas laid down that between the quaestorship and praetorship a Patrician\r\nmust hold the curule aedileship, a Plebeian one of the two aedileships\r\nor the tribunate.[1702] An exemption from this lengthy course could,\r\nhowever, be given by an exercise of the imperial right of _adlectio_.\r\nThis was the conferment of an artificial magisterial rank. In form it was\r\na power exercised in the revision of the list of the Senate and elevated\r\nfrom a lower to a higher grade within that order. But the _adlectio_ also\r\nhad the effect of qualifying for the magistracy immediately above the\r\nrank thus artificially assigned. One who was _adlectus inter quaestorios_\r\nwas qualified for the tribunate, one _adlectus inter tribunicios_ for the\r\npraetorship, and one _adlectus inter praetorios_ for the consulship. The\r\nconsulship was amongst civic magistracies still the crown of a political\r\ncareer; hence the rarity of adlection _inter consulares_.[1703]\r\n\r\nA smaller honour was the conferment by the Senate, generally on\r\nthe proposal of the Princeps, of the _ornamenta_ of a magistracy\r\n(_quaestoria_, _praetoria_, _consularia_) on one who had not held the\r\nmagistracy itself. This honour gave no right of entry into the Senate,\r\nand none of holding the magistracy next in rank to that whose ornaments\r\nwere conferred,[1704] but merely the privilege of wearing the _insignia_\r\nof an office at festivals and on other public occasions;[1705] it may,\r\nhowever, have given the right of voting with the class of senators\r\nwhose _ornamenta_ were conferred, if the person honoured was already\r\nprovided with a seat at the Senate.[1706] This distinction was by no\r\nmeans reserved for persons legally qualified for the magistracy; it\r\nmight be granted to knights high up in the imperial service, such as the\r\npraefects of the guard[1707] and of the watch,[1708] or to provincial\r\nprocurators.[1709] Claudius granted it to imperial freedmen,[1710] and we\r\nfind that even senators excluded from the curia were sometimes left the\r\n_ornamenta_ of their rank.[1711]\r\n\r\nThe permission to use the ornaments of a triumph (_ornamenta\r\ntriumphalia_) was the result of the limitation of the right to the\r\nactual triumph. The application of the principle that this right was\r\ninconsistent with a subordinate _imperium_,[1712] had, when applied to\r\nthe Principate, the effect of legally confining triumphs to the Princeps\r\nalone; for the governors of his own provinces were merely his delegates,\r\nwhile those of senatorial provinces, though nominally in independent\r\nauthority, had as a rule no armies at their command.[1713] The triumphal\r\n_insignia_ might, however, be granted by the Senate on the proposal of\r\nthe Princeps.[1714]\r\n\r\nThe election to the magistracies will be more fitly treated in connexion\r\nwith the _comitia_ and the Senate. The obligations to which their holders\r\nbound themselves on their appointment were those of the Republic, with\r\nthe exception that the _jus jurandum in leges_ was amplified by the\r\ninclusion of the valid _acta_ of the Princeps—those, that is, of a living\r\nor a previous emperor whose binding character had been recognised by\r\noath.[1715]\r\n\r\nIf we turn now to the individual offices, we find that the CONSULS\r\nare still the officially recognised heads of the Republic and of the\r\nSenate. On the suspension of the Principate they are the representatives\r\nof the state,[1716] and we find them acting in accordance with this\r\ncharacter. It was the consuls who, on the deposition of Nero, sent\r\ndespatches to Galba with the news of his selection,[1717] and it was by\r\nthe surrender of his dagger to a consul that the abdication of Vitellius\r\nwas effected.[1718] The dignity of the office is shown by the fact that\r\nit was the only one in which a citizen might have the Princeps as a\r\ncolleague, and still more by the view of a gracious emperor that, when\r\nhe was performing the functions of that office, the vast dignity of\r\nthe Principate was for a moment lost in that of the consulship.[1719]\r\nAs presidents of the Senate the consuls were partners in its nominal\r\nsovereignty. They guided its jurisdiction, both in civil and in criminal\r\nmatters, and in the former may have acted as its commissioners. They also\r\npossessed in their own right high judicial functions—in matters of trust\r\n(_fidei commissa_), for instance—which were originally delegated to them\r\nby the Princeps, and of which we shall treat elsewhere.\r\n\r\nBut the very fact that the consulship was such a prize, as well\r\nas the fact that its occupation led to the filling of other high\r\noffices—the government of certain senatorial and imperial provinces\r\nand the praefecture of the city—induced a shortening of its tenure and\r\na consequent multiplication of the individuals who might enjoy its\r\nprivileges and become qualified for other duties. The expensiveness of\r\nthe office may also have contributed to this end; for the increase in\r\nthe number of occupants would lessen the pecuniary burden imposed by the\r\ncelebration of games.[1720] Even the half-yearly consulships of the early\r\nPrincipate become in course of time very infrequent, and we subsequently\r\nfind a tenure of but four or two months.[1721] Those appointed for 1st\r\nJanuary were _ordinarii_, the others _suffecti_,[1722] and the whole year\r\nwas dated by the names of the former.\r\n\r\nThe number of the PRAETORS varied under Augustus and his successors\r\nfrom ten to eighteen. Twelve, fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen are found\r\nat various times, and the final limit of eighteen was still maintaining\r\nitself in the time of Hadrian.[1723] The reason for this expansion\r\nof their numbers was their utility for the enlarged jurisdiction of\r\nthe period. The Republican functions of the _praetor urbanus_ and\r\nthe _praetor peregrinus_ continued, until those of the latter became\r\nextinct, perhaps soon after the conferment of citizenship on the whole\r\nRoman world by Caracalla (212 A.D.);[1724] while other praetors, were\r\nguides of the _quaestiones perpetuae_, until the disappearance of these\r\ncommissions towards the close of the second century.[1725] But new\r\nspheres of extraordinary jurisdiction claimed the attention of others.\r\nThus Claudius instituted two praetors for adjudication on trusts (_fidei\r\ncommissarii_),[1726] Nerva one for the decision of cases arising between\r\nthe _fiscus_ and private individuals (_fiscalis_),[1727] and Marcus\r\nAurelius another for the granting, and perhaps for the control, of\r\nguardians (_tutelaris_).[1728] For a short time the administration of the\r\n_aerarium_ was also in the hands of praetors.[1729]\r\n\r\nMost of the specific functions, which the AEDILES had exercised\r\nduring the Republic, now passed to other hands or were shorn of their\r\nimportance. The history of the later Republic had shown how incompetent\r\nthese officials were to exercise an adequate control of the market,\r\nand the _cura annonae_ passed to the Princeps and to the praefecture\r\nestablished by him. Their police functions were to a large extent\r\nabsorbed by the praefecture of the city, but they still destroyed books\r\ncondemned by the Senate,[1730] and attempted to carry out the sumptuary\r\nlaws.[1731] The _cura urbis_ still entailed on them the duty of keeping\r\nclean the streets of Rome[1732] and a supervision over places of public\r\nresort.[1733] Much of their criminal jurisdiction must have lapsed with\r\nthe disappearance of trials before the _comitia_, but they still retain\r\na power of inflicting fines and seizing pledges—one which was limited\r\nand regulated during the reign of Nero[1734]—and the special civil\r\njurisdiction of the curule aediles still continues.[1735]\r\n\r\nThe QUAESTORS still maintained their functions as financial officials and\r\ngeneral assistants to the magistrates. Their number had been raised by\r\nCaesar to forty, but was again reduced to twenty by Augustus.[1736] For\r\na time two quaestors had the guardianship of the _aerarium_,[1737] and\r\nothers were in the public provinces the financial and judicial assistants\r\nof the proconsuls.[1738] Four more were assigned to the consuls, two to\r\neach, as their agents and assistants;[1739] while the Princeps himself\r\nemployed two, commended by himself (_quaestores Augusti_, _quaestores\r\ncandidati principis_), chiefly for the purpose of reading his despatches\r\nto the Senate.[1740] During the reign of Claudius a step was taken which\r\n“put up the quaestorship for sale,”[1741] and associated it with a\r\nfunction that clung to it longer than any other. This was the exhibition\r\nof gladiatorial games at the cost of the exhibitor,[1742] a pecuniary\r\nburden which henceforth fell on every aspirant for higher office, until\r\nSeverus Alexander ordained that only the _quaestores candidati_ should\r\nthemselves defray the expenses of these spectacles, the cost of the games\r\ngiven by the others being defrayed from the _fiscus_.[1743]\r\n\r\nThe TRIBUNES OF THE PLEBS were not colleagues of the Princeps, for the\r\n_tribunica potestas_ was not the tribunate, and the actions in virtue\r\nof it were not even theoretically subject to the tribunes’ veto. But\r\ntheir great negative powers were still occasionally exercised in some\r\ndepartments of state during the first century of the Principate. Like\r\nthe office itself, however, they were but a shadow of those of the\r\nRepublic.[1744] The _intercessio_ against decrees of the Senate might\r\nbe attempted when unimportant matters, such as the right to scourge\r\nactors, were under discussion,[1745] or might be employed as a warning\r\nto the Senate that the Princeps should be consulted on the business\r\nin hand.[1746] In higher matters of state its exercise might mean\r\ndanger or death to the tribune who mistook the fictitious for the real\r\nRepublic, or who, recognising the tyranny, chose to brave the anger of\r\nthe Emperor.[1747] The right of _auxilium_ was still exercised against a\r\npraetor in 56 A.D.,[1748] and appealed to by an Emperor in 69.[1749] But\r\nthis, too, soon disappeared to leave no trace. In the early Principate\r\nthe tribunes seem to have possessed some right of summoning civil cases\r\nfrom the Italian towns to Rome,[1750] probably through an exercise of\r\nthe veto; and, although their criminal jurisdiction had disappeared with\r\nthe _comitia_, they retained some power of inflicting fines (_multae_),\r\nwhich was limited during the reign of Nero.[1751] There is also evidence\r\nthat they still possessed the right of veto in civil jurisdiction.[1752]\r\nAmongst positive powers their presidency of the Senate still survives, as\r\nwe shall see in dealing with that body.\r\n\r\nThe office of tribune, since it conferred little distinction, was by\r\nno means an object of ambition; and the difficulty of getting the ten\r\nplaces filled led to the inclusion of this magistracy, as one of the\r\nnecessary steps, in the _cursus honorum_,[1753] and sometimes to more\r\ndrastic measures such as the selection of ex-quaestors by lot under\r\nAugustus,[1754] or the reception of members of the equestrian order under\r\nClaudius.[1755] Yet, with all its disadvantages, the tribunate survived\r\nthe Principate, and tribunes are named in imperial despatches of the\r\nfourth century.[1756]\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) _The Comitia_\r\n\r\nAn element in the restoration of the Republic by Augustus, after the\r\nprovisional government of the Triumvirate was over, was a renewal of the\r\nlife of the popular assemblies.[1757] But it was impossible that their\r\npurely local character could be reconciled with the imperial interests of\r\nthe day, or that their popular character should be consistent with the\r\nrule of the Princeps and his nobility. For a moment they remained to a\r\ncertain extent a reality, and throughout the Principate they exercised\r\nthe shadow of power which was sufficient to express the still surviving\r\ntheory of popular sovereignty.\r\n\r\nFrom the first a considerable portion of the powers of the _comitia_ had\r\nbeen transferred wholly to the Princeps; for to him belonged the rights\r\nof declaring war, of making peace, and of forming alliances;[1758] while\r\nthe criminal jurisdiction which the people exercised at the end of the\r\nRepublic was no longer necessary, for while the more definite portion of\r\nit was handed over to the _quaestiones_,[1759] the more indefinite now\r\nfell under the extraordinary cognisance of the Senate. Legislative power\r\ntended to centre more and more in the Princeps and Senate, and it is\r\nonly during the first century that enactments are mentioned which have\r\nthe true forms of _leges_ and _plebiscita_.[1760] The right of election\r\nwas the most permanent of the popular prerogatives. Under Augustus the\r\npeople still chose its magistrates, although the choice was considerably\r\ninfluenced by the Princeps;[1761] and after Tiberius in the first year of\r\nhis reign had caused all the real elements of election—the profession,\r\nthe nomination, the vote—to be transferred to the Senate,[1762] the\r\nformal _renuntiatio_ of the successful candidates (an integral part of\r\nthe election)[1763] still continued to be made to the people down to\r\nthe third century.[1764] It is only in respect to the consulship that\r\nthere is a doubt whether, during the first century A.D., more than the\r\nmere announcement of the result was not effected in the _comitia_. The\r\nevidence is conflicting, but the indications of a formal popular control\r\nof these appointments are on the whole outweighed by those which refer to\r\nthe Senate the real elements of election—rendered nugatory at times by\r\nthe way in which the Princeps exercised his powers of nomination.[1765]\r\nThere can be little question, however, that in the later Principate the\r\nconsular, like all other, elections were vested in the Senate. The\r\nsurvival of the _comitia_ into the third century, whether for the purpose\r\nof the _renuntiatio_ or for that of ratifying the powers of the Princeps,\r\nwas no mere mass-meeting informally assembled. The stately forms of the\r\nRepublic were preserved, and when the centuries were assembled the red\r\nflag still flew from the Janiculum.[1766]\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) _The Senate_\r\n\r\nIt was through the Senate of the Principate that the idea of popular\r\nsovereignty was most practically and even most formally expressed;\r\nand, as the Principate claimed and even tried to be nothing more than\r\nthe extraordinary magistracy of a Republic, the most infinite pains\r\nwas taken with this body to give it dignity, stability, and weight. We\r\nshall speak elsewhere of the senatorial “order” which was created during\r\nthe Principate; it was from this order that the Senate was recruited,\r\nand the will of the Princeps could be very distinctly asserted in the\r\nselection of members of the great council. Entrance was, as in the\r\nRepublic, chiefly through the magistracy, the tenure of the quaestorship\r\nqualifying for a seat at the board. When, therefore, the Senate\r\nbecame itself the electing body, the principle of entrance was one of\r\ncooptation; and as the Princeps did not, to any great extent, influence\r\nthe selection of quaestors by his _commendatio_,[1767] the principle\r\nwas something more than a mere theory. But we shall see that he often\r\ngave the _latus clavus_ which admitted to the senatorial order; we have\r\nseen that he advanced to the military tribunate, which became one of the\r\nqualifications for the quaestorship;[1768] he might also have exercised\r\nan influence in the formal nomination of candidates for this office;\r\nwhile his right of _adlectio_,[1769] when exercised with reference to\r\npersons who had not been magistrates, gave him the power of actually\r\ncreating senators.\r\n\r\nThe qualifications for the Senate had reference to age, wealth, and\r\nbirth. As twenty-five was the minimum age for the quaestorship, a man\r\nmight be a senator at twenty-six.[1770] The _census_ required, though it\r\nvaried from time to time during the reign of Augustus, was finally fixed\r\nat a million sesterces.[1771] _Ingenuitas_ was required—Claudius even\r\ndemanded free birth through three generations[1772]—and it was counted\r\none of the abuses of tyrannical rule when the favour of Emperors admitted\r\nfreedmen into the Senate.[1773] For a time the council maintained its\r\nmainly Roman character, but “new men” from Italy and the provinces\r\ncrept in with the censorships of Claudius and Vespasian,[1774] and the\r\nformer Emperor even granted admission to the Gallic Aedui, perhaps by an\r\nemployment of his right of _adlectio_.[1775] The reception of provincials\r\nfinally became so frequent that, to give them an Italian interest, it\r\nwas decreed by Trajan that one-third of their property must be invested\r\nin land in Italy,[1776] a quota that was changed by Marcus Aurelius to\r\none-fourth.[1777]\r\n\r\nRemoval from the Senate belonged to the Emperor either as censor, when he\r\nexercised the discretionary moral judgment which had been associated with\r\nthe Republican _lectio_,[1778] or in virtue of that power of revision\r\nwhich, as we have seen, became associated with the Principate.[1779] The\r\nchief grounds of exclusion were lack of the requisite census, refusal\r\nto take the oath _in acta Caesaris_ which was demanded of senators as\r\nof magistrates,[1780] or condemnation for crime. The Senate itself, in\r\nthe exercise of its judicial power, could add to the sentence which it\r\ninflicted on a senator the penalty of expulsion from the house;[1781]\r\nit might even make this expulsion a punishment for calumnious\r\naccusation.[1782] The revised list of the Senate (_album senatorium_)\r\nwas posted up publicly every year,[1783] and the Emperor appeared at\r\nthe head of this list as _princeps senatus_.[1784] The number of the\r\nSenate was fixed by Augustus at 600,[1785] and, as there seems to have\r\nbeen little or no alteration in the number of the quaestors, the size of\r\nthe body into which they passed may have been fairly constant. Augustus\r\nalso instituted fixed days for meeting. These regular meetings (_senatus\r\nlegitimi_) took place twice a month, on the Kalends and the Ides, except\r\nduring the autumn months of September and October, and attendance on\r\nthese days was compulsory.[1786] Even to these meetings, however, there\r\nwas a summons through an edict.[1787] Extraordinary sittings (_senatus\r\nindicti_) could also be held whenever the magistrate deemed them\r\nnecessary.[1788] The presidency and summons belonged chiefly to the\r\nconsuls, but, as in the Republic, were possessed also by the praetors and\r\ntribunes.[1789] When the Senate had been summoned, the Princeps shared in\r\nthe presidency as a magistrate, and it is very questionable whether he\r\never appeared at the board in the character of a simple senator.[1790] As\r\na magistrate he might address the house at any moment, and, during the\r\nearly Principate at least, custom dictated that there should be a pause\r\nat the opening and at the close of a debate which the Princeps might fill\r\nup with an expression of opinion if he pleased.[1791] We have already\r\nnoticed the singular privileges which he possessed in the matter of\r\nbringing business before the house.[1792]\r\n\r\nAmongst the powers of the Senate, that which was formally the greatest\r\nwas the creation and deposition of the Princeps. We have already seen how\r\nthis right was limited in practice;[1793] but its nominal exercise was an\r\nexpression of the view that the sovereignty of the Roman people now found\r\nits chief exponent in the ancient council. The same idea is expressed in\r\nthe senatorial power of dispensation from laws—whether in favour of the\r\nPrinceps and members of his house,[1794] or in administrative matters\r\nsuch as the right of forming associations.[1795] The elective power which\r\nthe Senate enjoyed from the beginning of the reign of Tiberius[1796] is\r\nalso a sign of its perpetuating the powers of the people.\r\n\r\nOver foreign administration, once the great bulwark of its power, the\r\nSenate has now but little control. Although it still receives messages\r\nof the victories of the Princeps, and grants him a triumph,[1797] it has\r\nlost all independent rights of war, peace, and alliance. But it receives\r\nenvoys from the provinces which are under its control,[1798] and from\r\nthe towns of Italy,[1799] and, at least in the first century of the\r\nPrincipate, it may act as the advising body of the Princeps in spheres\r\nwhich pertain wholly to him. Tiberius consulted the Senate on military\r\nquestions;[1800] Vespasian waived an embarrassing offer of help from the\r\nParthians by urging them to send an embassy to the Senate; and Decebalus,\r\nafter his conquest by Trajan, obtained his final terms of peace by the\r\nsame means.[1801] Such concessions were doubtless acts of grace on the\r\npart of the Princeps, but they also represent a constitutional principle\r\nwhich finally disappeared—the principle of consulting the representatives\r\nof the people on questions that were of paramount interest to the state.\r\n\r\nThe other powers of the Senate, which express its sovereignty or its\r\npartnership of administration with the Princeps, we must reserve for the\r\nnext section, in which we shall attempt to illustrate the theory of a\r\ndual control which pervades the constitution of the Principate.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5. _The Chief Departments of the State; the Dual Control of Senate and\r\nPrinceps_\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that, in the most essential fact of sovereignty—the\r\ncreation of the Principate—the Senate and people, or rather the Senate as\r\nrepresenting the people, was theoretically supreme.[1802] The attribute\r\nof sovereignty that comes nearest to this is the power of legislation,\r\nfor it is one that the “determinate human superior” generally retains\r\nin his own hands. The other functions that are usually associated with\r\nthe highest authority in a community, such as the control of general\r\nadministration, jurisdiction, finance, cultus and coinage, may more\r\neasily be delegated. If the delegation is temporary, there is no division\r\nof sovereign power; if perpetual, there is such a division unless the\r\nlegislative power be thought of as capable of recalling the mandate.\r\nWe have already seen to what a large extent the people had delegated\r\nits powers to the Princeps, and we have also seen that this delegation\r\nwas, in fact though not in theory, perpetual.[1803] But, in the spheres\r\nof authority which we are now about to examine, there is neither the\r\ntheory of complete retention, nor that of complete delegation, of\r\nsovereign power. The sovereign has partly retained and has partly\r\ndelegated in perpetuity every one of the functions of government which\r\nwe have enumerated, and this singular dualism affects, not only the\r\nadministrative, but even the legislative activity of the state.\r\n\r\n(i.) _Legislation._—With respect to legislation it has already been\r\nshown how the _comitia_ still uttered their general mandates until a\r\nperiod at least as late as the reign of Nerva.[1804] But, even before\r\nthe legislative power of the people became extinct, this power had been\r\npassing to the Senate; and in the strict theory of the constitution, true\r\nlegislative authority is to be finally found only in the great council\r\nwhich represents the people.\r\n\r\nThe origin of this senatorial legislation is doubtless to be sought in\r\nthe advice on legal points which the Republican Senate had often tendered\r\nto the magistrate, and in the interpretation of customary law or of\r\nenactments which often accompanied this advice.[1805] It has, indeed,\r\nbeen noted that the _senatus consulta_ of the Principate, which prescribe\r\ngeneral commands such as in the Republic would have been the subject of\r\n_leges_, are often expressed in this advisory form;[1806] decrees of the\r\nSenate never attained the formal structure of a law;[1807] they also\r\nlack its imperative mode of utterance, and for these two reasons they\r\nwere never described as _leges_. The highest degree of validity which\r\nthe jurist could give them was “the binding force of laws”;[1808] but\r\nthis force was sufficient to make them sources of the _jus civile_,[1809]\r\nand down to the third century such general commands as tended to alter\r\nthe fundamental legal relations of Roman citizens to one another, were\r\ngenerally expressed in the form of _senatus consulta_.\r\n\r\nThe Princeps, on the other hand, is not credited directly with any\r\npower of legislation; but the faculty for making _jus_, which was\r\ninherent in the _imperium_ of every Roman magistrate, and especially\r\napparent in that of the praetor, was manifested by the Princeps in an\r\nunexampled degree. His methods of utterance are through the edict, the\r\ndecree, and the rescript. The _edictum_ is, like that of the praetor,\r\ntechnically an interpretation of law; but the creative power associated\r\nwith interpretation is here pushed to its extremest limits, and statute\r\nlaw supplemented this faculty inherent in the _imperium_ by explicitly\r\ndeclaring that whatever ordinances the Princeps might lay down should\r\n(with certain limitations fixed by precedents) be considered valid.[1810]\r\nWhether the edict of one Princeps bound his successor must have depended\r\nto some extent on the degree of formality in the utterance. Tiberius\r\nprofesses respect even for the _obiter dicta_ of Augustus;[1811] but\r\nthis reverence was exaggerated, and none but the formal edicts expressed\r\nin written form could, as a rule, have been included in the _acta_. It is\r\nby no means certain that even these were always included in the _acta_ to\r\nwhich the oath was taken;[1812] but if an edict had been recognised as\r\nvalid by several succeeding Principes and was then abandoned, some formal\r\nmethod of repudiation seems to have been necessary.[1813]\r\n\r\nThe _decretum_ was, in its strict sense, the sentence of the Princeps\r\nwhen sitting as a high court of justice;[1814] as a _res judicata_ it\r\nnecessarily possessed absolutely binding force for the case in which\r\nit was issued, and prevented any renewal of this process; but, unless\r\nformally rescinded in a succeeding reign, its validity as a precedent\r\nseems not to have been questioned, and the words _Caesar dixit_ appeal to\r\nthe jurists almost with the force of law.[1815]\r\n\r\nThe third mode of utterance is by means of the letter (_epistola_) or\r\nrescript (_rescriptum_).[1816] These letters contained instructions\r\neither on administrative or on judicial matters. In their first character\r\nthey might be addressed either to individual officials subordinate to the\r\nEmperor or to the provincial diet,[1817] the scope of their application\r\ndepending on the Emperor’s discretion at the time of the issue, and\r\non the interpretation of the rescript after his death. In matters of\r\njustice, whether addressed to the judge or to the litigant, they might\r\nsettle doubtful points of law or extend a principle to new cases. The\r\npower of interpretation is at least as great in the rescript as in the\r\nedict; but the rescript was the more powerful vehicle for law-making.\r\nIt kept the Princeps in constant touch with the provincial world, and\r\nwas the chief mode in which the uniformity of its administration and its\r\nlaw was moulded. The rescripts also had, on account of the precision and\r\npermanence of their form, a more unquestioned validity, as perpetual\r\nenactments, than either the edict or the decree. When the _acta_ of an\r\nemperor are referred to, it is chiefly these, together with the charters\r\nor privileges (_leges datae_, _beneficia_) that he may have conferred on\r\nstates, that are intended. The rescripts might be elicited either by the\r\n_consultatio_ of a doubtful official who was subordinated, either as an\r\nadministrator or as a judge, to the Emperor, or they might be written in\r\nanswer to the petition (_libellus_, _supplicatio_) of one of the parties\r\nto a suit. In the latter case they were often a convenient substitute for\r\nthe personal appearance of the appellant in the Emperor’s court.\r\n\r\nThe edicts, decrees, and rescripts came eventually to be described as\r\n“imperial constitutions” (_constitutiones principum_), and although,\r\nas we have seen, different degrees of permanence might attach to each\r\nof these methods of utterance, to a jurist of the second century they\r\nall had the force of law.[1818] From this category of enactments with\r\nbinding force one important class of imperial ordinances seems formally\r\nto have been exempted. This class consisted of the _mandata_, or\r\ngeneral instructions which the Princeps gave to officials subordinate\r\nto himself. In the early Principate they were for the most part issued\r\nto the governors of Caesar’s provinces, but the gradual encroachment of\r\nthe Emperor’s powers on senatorial administration led to the mandates\r\nbeing issued to proconsuls as well. When the mandate dealt with a precise\r\npoint of the _jus civile_ and was repeated by successive emperors, it\r\ndoubtless came to have the force of a rescript;[1819] but it was more\r\noften concerned with the general administrative duties of subordinates,\r\ndirecting them in the doubtful cases of the moment, and, therefore,\r\nnot necessarily laying down rules of perpetual validity. In one sense\r\nthe mandate stands higher than the rescript, for it is as a rule more\r\ngeneral in form, and a _mandatum_ may be the result of a series of\r\n_rescripta_ on the same point; but in another sense it stands lower,\r\nsince it was understood that it might be recalled at any moment by\r\nthe Princeps who had issued it, and that it might not be observed by\r\nhis successor. The remarkable differences of treatment to which the\r\nChristians were subjected during the Principate was due chiefly to\r\nthe fact that, so far as this treatment was a concern of the central\r\ngovernment at all, it was one directed by mandate.\r\n\r\nA review of the powers of the Princeps as exercised through his\r\n“constitutions” and his mandates shows that he was not regarded as a true\r\nlegislative authority, and that the binding force of his ordinances was\r\ntechnically inferior to that possessed by decrees of the Senate. But the\r\ntheory of legislation was never of much practical importance at Rome. The\r\nRomans had lived for centuries mainly under the rule of interpreted or\r\njudge-made law, and now the Roman world, enlarged and unified, looked for\r\nguidance, not to the _comitia_, which were in decay, or to the Senate,\r\nwhose contact with the provinces was ever becoming less, but to the one\r\ninterpreter who was known to every judge and every litigant, and whose\r\nutterances could be heard at the farthest ends of the earth. It was the\r\nforce of circumstances, not any constitutional theory, which made the\r\nPrinceps the highest of all legislative, because the greatest of all\r\ninterpreting, authorities.\r\n\r\n(ii.) _Jurisdiction._—If we turn from the legislative to the judicial\r\nsphere, we find the same theoretical assertion of a dual control. But it\r\nis complicated in this instance by the fact that the Senate is not the\r\nsole representative of the Republican side of the administration. The\r\nstate still asserts itself through old organs such as the praetors and\r\nthe _judices_, while it has acquired a new organ in the joint activity of\r\nconsuls and Senate. In a sphere parallel to theirs the Princeps works,\r\nsometimes exercising a jurisdiction that is all his own, at other times\r\ninfringing on their powers, but always occupying a position that exhibits\r\nhim to the provincial mind as the highest court in the Roman world. The\r\njurisdiction of these several courts must be treated in its separate\r\naspects of civil and criminal, of jurisdiction in the first instance\r\nand by way of appeal. The power of reversing sentences and the right to\r\npardon must also be considered.\r\n\r\nThe civil jurisdiction of the Republic, with its division into _jus_\r\nand _judicium_, continued during the greater part of the period of the\r\nPrincipate, and the praetor still gave his legal rulings in the shape of\r\na formula which he submitted to a _judex_. But these _judicia ordinaria_\r\ntended gradually to be replaced by the personal cognisance (_cognitio_)\r\nof the magistrate, which, exercised on a limited scale by the praetor\r\nduring the Republic, became a feature of the Emperor’s own jurisdiction\r\nfrom the very beginning of the Principate, and was soon extended to\r\nprovincial governors and to his great delegates, the praefects. This\r\njurisdiction was described as _extra ordinem_, and, like the other form,\r\nit admitted of a distinction between magistrate and _judex_. But the\r\nnew _judex extra ordinem datus_[1820] is wholly different in character\r\nfrom the _judex ordinarius_ of the older form of process. The new\r\nprocedure does not admit the distinction between _jus_ and _judicium_;\r\nthe _judex_ is a true delegate, is appointed without a _formula_, and\r\ndecides on the law as well as on the facts of the case. The sphere of\r\nthe _cognitio_ of the Princeps was probably unlimited in theory, and\r\nmay have been conferred on the first Emperor by statute.[1821] It was\r\na voluntary jurisdiction which any one might request and which the\r\nEmperor might refuse. In case of such refusal the case was taken by\r\nthe praetor. The early Principes, however, showed an unwillingness to\r\ninterfere with the common-law jurisdiction of the ordinary courts, and\r\nconfined their attention to cases of equity, such as those springing from\r\nmatters of trust (_fidei commissum_) and guardianship (_tutela_). But\r\nthe number even of these cases soon became too vast for the cognisance\r\nof the Emperor and his occasional delegates, and we have seen how\r\nspecial praetors were successively appointed to share in this equitable\r\njurisdiction.[1822]\r\n\r\nThe civil courts of appeal existing under the Principate are partly\r\ndue to a survival of the Republican principle of _appellatio_ to a\r\nmagistrate with the right of veto, partly to the principle (new for\r\nRome, though not for the provinces) of delegated jurisdiction, and\r\npartly to a wholly novel principle of an appeal which can completely\r\nreverse the decisions of a lower court, which has its origin mainly in\r\nan attempt at centralising the higher provincial jurisdiction in Rome.\r\nFrom the decision of a _judex_ in the _judicia ordinaria_ there is now,\r\nas formerly, no appeal to any authority, although, as we shall see, the\r\nsentences of _judices_ might, under certain conditions, be reversed by\r\nthe authority either of the praetor or the Princeps. From the decision\r\nof the praetor _in jure_ an appeal lies as before to an equal or higher\r\nauthority,[1823] and the veto in virtue of the _major potestas_ or\r\n_majus imperium_ is naturally possessed by the Princeps. When we find\r\nTiberius present in the praetor’s court, he may be there for the purpose\r\nof over-ruling that magistrate’s decisions.[1824] His presence seems to\r\nshow that the limitations of the old _auxilium_—which must be offered in\r\nperson[1825]—were preserved. Whether the veto was pronounced in virtue\r\nof the _imperium_ or in virtue of the _tribunicia potestas_ is a matter\r\nof indifference; how the veto operated is the really important point. On\r\nthe analogy of the Republican intercession its effects should have been\r\npurely cassatory, and perhaps in the early Principate this principle\r\nwas observed. But it must be remembered that the Princeps is in a very\r\ndifferent position to the vetoing consul or tribune of the Republic,\r\nor even to the Republican praetor who presides over a department other\r\nthan that which he controls by his veto. These magistrates can negative\r\na decision of a lower court, but they cannot replace this negatived\r\ndecision by a positive judgment of their own. The Princeps, on the other\r\nhand, has a theoretically unlimited power of civil jurisdiction.[1826] He\r\ncan, therefore, supplement his negative by a positive judgment, and this\r\nunique combination of the power of vetoing and the power of judging is\r\nalmost unquestionably the basis of that appeal to Caesar which leads to\r\nthe reformation of a sentence. It is not improbable that the appeal came\r\nto operate in this way even against the praetor, although, even if it\r\ndid not, the effect of Caesar’s veto would really be reformatory. Even\r\nthe tribunes of the Republic could put pressure on a praetor to induce\r\nhim to alter his formula,[1827] and we can hardly imagine the praetor\r\nwithstanding the suggestion accompanying a veto pronounced by the holder\r\nof the _tribunicia potestas_. The jurisdiction of the municipal towns\r\nof Italy was, so far as it was “ordinary” jurisdiction, still under the\r\ncontrol of consuls, praetors, and tribunes, at least as late as the reign\r\nof Nero.[1828] These municipal courts were technically those of the\r\n_praetor urbanus_, and the Princeps probably interfered (if at all) with\r\ntheir jurisdiction only through his control of the rulings of the praetor\r\nin Rome. We shall trace elsewhere the mode in which the extraordinary\r\njurisdiction of one of Caesar’s delegates, the praefect of the city, came\r\nto encroach on the ordinary jurisdiction of the Roman courts.\r\n\r\nAnother method of appeal springs from the principle of delegated\r\njurisdiction. Caesar, when he cares to exercise civil jurisdiction,\r\ncan perform it either personally or through mandataries, and there is\r\nnecessarily an appeal from the mandatary to the higher authority, unless\r\nthis authority distinctly asserts that no appeal will lie.[1829] The\r\nappeal in such a case, if it is upheld, issues not merely in the veto but\r\nin the reform of the sentence of the mandatary. Caesar may, of course,\r\nemploy such delegates as he pleases. Augustus used the _praetor urbanus_\r\nand _consulares_ for home and foreign _appellationes_,[1830] a word which\r\nin this context probably means simply “requests for cognisance” made\r\nto the Princeps. The imperial jurisdiction in matters of trust (_fidei\r\ncommissa_) was delegated to consuls or to praetors.[1831] But, apart from\r\nthis regular delegation, the Emperor might instruct any one to be his\r\n_judex extra ordinem_, when he did not care to take the case himself.\r\n\r\nThe appeal from provincial governors was, so far as the public or\r\nsenatorial provinces were concerned, the result of a conscious striving\r\nafter unity of administration, although it was not wholly unconnected\r\nwith Republican precedents; with respect to Caesar’s provinces, it was\r\na direct consequence of the fact that the governors of these provinces\r\nwere merely his legates, although the frequency with which the appeal\r\nwas allowed shows the same striving for a centralised jurisdiction.\r\nThe principle which in the early Principate regulated appeals from the\r\npublic provinces was that these should come invariably to the Senate,\r\nand this principle of the dyarchy, which tended to be disregarded, was\r\nemphatically restated by Nero at the commencement of his reign.[1832]\r\nIt was probably a development of a Republican custom in accordance with\r\nwhich certain important cases had been summoned from the provinces to\r\nRome by the consuls and Senate (_Romam revocatio_);[1833] but this\r\nprinciple seems to have been now extended to include true cases of\r\nappeal as well as cases of denial of jurisdiction. When such appeals in\r\ncivil matters came to Rome, it is probable that the Senate delegated the\r\nhearing of them to the consuls.\r\n\r\nThe fact that this principle of the appellate jurisdiction of the Senate\r\nrequired restatement in 54 A.D. prepares us for the ultimate neglect\r\ninto which it fell. It is certain that by the close of the second and\r\nbeginning of the third century, Caesar, or his great delegate the\r\npraefect of the praetorian guard, is the universal court of appeal\r\nfor the whole provincial world. This result cannot be attached to any\r\npower possessed by the Princeps over the proconsuls of the public\r\nprovinces; for the statement that he possessed _maius imperium_ over\r\nsuch governors[1834] can only mean that in any collision of authority\r\nthe Princeps is not inferior to the proconsul. The world-wide appellate\r\njurisdiction of the Princeps was a thing of very gradual growth, and\r\nit originated, not from any idea of his prerogative, but from the\r\nirresistible tendency of provincial governors, senatorial as well as\r\nimperial, to refer their difficulties to the highest interpreting\r\nauthority in the Roman world, the Princeps and his _consilium_ of\r\njudicial advisers. It is no wonder that the man who became the central\r\nsource of law should also become the universal authority for its\r\ninterpretation in detail.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to criminal jurisdiction, we find that here too there are\r\nthree sources of _jus_. The Republic is represented by the _quaestiones\r\nperpetuae_ with their praetors and equestrian _judices_, and also by the\r\nnew criminal jurisdiction which has been attached to the consuls and the\r\nSenate; the Principate is represented by the jurisdiction of the Princeps\r\nand his delegates. The jurisdiction of the _quaestiones_, so long as it\r\ncontinued,[1835] proceeded on the old lines. They judged except where the\r\ncase, through a request of the parties accepted by a higher court, was\r\nexempted from their jurisdiction. The higher courts, which might stop\r\ntheir jurisdiction by accepting a case, were those of the Senate and\r\nthe Princeps. Both of these were high courts of voluntary jurisdiction,\r\nand no appeal was permitted from one to the other.[1836] Voluntary\r\njurisdiction is by its nature difficult to define; but custom tended to\r\nlimit the Senate’s cognisance to certain classes of cases. These classes\r\nwere determined either by the position of the accused or the nature of\r\nthe offence. The Senate tried ordinary crimes, such as murder, adultery,\r\nincest, when they were committed by the members of the upper classes\r\nin society,[1837] and there was a growing feeling, which subsequently\r\nobtained something like legal recognition, that a senator should be\r\ntried by his peers.[1838] But the character of the offence was the chief\r\ndeterminant of the Senate’s jurisdiction. Any offence of a directly\r\npolitical character, even in the early Principate a breach of a treaty by\r\na foreign prince,[1839] tended to come before it. It was the usual court\r\nfor extortion or other misuse of powers by provincial governors;[1840]\r\nit judged offences against the majesty of the state;[1841] and when the\r\nmajesty of the Princeps had become identified with that of the state,\r\nit might be employed as a convenient engine of judicial tyranny.[1842]\r\nIts utility was assisted by the unlimited and arbitrary character of\r\nits jurisdiction. It interpreted while it judged; it might extend the\r\nincidence of a law and frame new penalties; it might even punish in cases\r\nwhere no penalty was fixed by law;[1843] and the principle, forbidden in\r\nthe _quaestiones_, of uniting several crimes in the same charge, was here\r\nadmitted.[1844] This jurisdiction was technically, perhaps, a _cognitio_\r\nof the consuls.[1845] But the Senate was their constant advising body,\r\nand the sentence took the form of a _senatus consultum_. We shall soon\r\nsee how the Emperor’s presence at the board enabled him to influence a\r\njurisdiction which was technically independent of his control.\r\n\r\nThe voluntary jurisdiction of the Princeps in criminal matters was\r\ntheoretically unlimited, and could be exercised at any time or in any\r\nplace. It rested with him whether he would undertake the cognisance\r\n(_cognitionem suscipere_) at the request of one of the parties,[1846]\r\nor refer the case to the ordinary courts that is, to the _quaestio_\r\ncompetent to try it. The relations of the two high courts of voluntary\r\njurisdiction to the ordinary court of necessary jurisdiction, are\r\nadmirably exemplified by the procedure adopted in the trial of Piso\r\nfor the murder of Germanicus (A.D. 19-20). It is at the outset assumed\r\nthat the case, which is one of poisoning, will come before the special\r\ncommission established by the _lex Cornelia de veneficis_. But the\r\nEmperor’s cognisance is sought by the prosecutor, and Tiberius and his\r\n_consilium_ actually listen to the preliminaries of the trial. But\r\nthe Emperor soon sees how invidious it will be to pronounce judgment\r\nin a case in which the murder of his own nephew and adopted son is\r\nthe subject of investigation, and he, therefore, sends the matter\r\nunprejudiced to the Senate with a request that they should exercise\r\ntheir voluntary jurisdiction—a request which, coming from the Princeps,\r\nit was practically, although not legally, impossible for the Senate to\r\ndecline.[1847]\r\n\r\nBut, although any request for cognisance might be listened to, the\r\nPrinceps usually confined his personal jurisdiction to certain spheres.\r\nThese included serious crimes committed by members of the upper ranks in\r\nsociety, but especially offences committed by imperial servants or by\r\nthe officers of the army.[1848] The Emperor might, of course, delegate\r\nthis jurisdiction, although the delegation of special cases seems to\r\nhave been unusual.[1849] On the other hand, the regular delegation of\r\ncertain kinds of offences is frequent enough, and is the basis of the\r\ncriminal jurisdiction of the Emperor’s servants, the various praefects\r\nwho presided over the city, the praetorian guard, the corn-supply, and\r\nthe watch.[1850]\r\n\r\nA peculiar right of the Princeps to try cases from the provinces in\r\nwhich the lives of Roman citizens were involved may, perhaps, have grown\r\nup during the Principate. It certainly does not exist during the early\r\nportion of this period. Instances of the maintenance of the Republican\r\nprinciple, that capital charges against Roman citizens should be sent\r\nto Rome, are indeed furnished by such cases as those of the Bithynian\r\nChristians in the reign of Trajan,[1851] and perhaps of St. Paul’s\r\nappeal in the reign of Nero;[1852] and perhaps such a demand for a\r\ntrial at Rome was accompanied by a request, usually accepted, to be\r\ntried before the Princeps; but there are as many instances which prove\r\nthe unlimited jurisdiction of the provincial governor, at least when\r\ndealing with ordinary crimes. Thus Marius Priscus scourged and strangled\r\na Roman knight in the province of Africa, and Galba, when governor\r\nof Tarraconensis, crucified a guardian, who was a Roman citizen, for\r\npoisoning his ward.[1853] There are, however, signs that the right to\r\nkill (_jus gladii_), if this expression refers to ordinary as well as\r\nto military jurisdiction, was specially given by the Emperor at least\r\nto the administrators of his own provinces,[1854] which shows that the\r\nfrequent requests of one who stood “before Caesar’s judgment seat” to\r\nbe tried by Caesar had issued in some standing rule. At a later time,\r\nwhen the universal criminal appeal to Caesar had grown up, certain\r\npersons—senators, officers, and decurions—are exempted from capital or\r\nsevere penalties pronounced by provincial governors,[1855] and this\r\njurisdiction, reserved for the Princeps, was exercised by the _praefectus\r\npraetorio_ without appeal.\r\n\r\nThe Princeps was (especially in the early Principate) by no means a\r\nuniversal court of criminal appeal for the whole Roman world. There was\r\nno appeal to him from the _quaestiones perpetuae_, although he may have\r\nhad some right of rescinding the inequitable judgments of such courts\r\n(_in integrum restitutio_); nor is there theoretically any appeal from\r\nthe Senate, although the Princeps possesses, through the _tribunicia\r\npotestas_, a practical power of rescinding the judgments of that\r\nbody.[1856] In the matter of jurisdiction delegated to his praefects,\r\nthe appeal lies unless he wills it away, as he does in favour of the\r\n_praefectus praetorio_. With respect to the provinces, the principle\r\nof the dual control, which we have illustrated with reference to civil\r\njurisdiction,[1857] must have originally been supposed to hold good\r\nwith reference to criminal jurisdiction as well; but the dyarchy was,\r\nin this particular, ultimately dissolved. By the end of the second\r\ncentury Caesar, represented in most cases by his inappellable praetorian\r\npraefect, was the highest court of criminal appeal for the whole Roman\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nBesides the right of appeal, there is in most political societies a\r\npower residing somewhere which is, or approximates to be, a power of\r\npardon. It is sometimes regarded as a signal attribute of sovereignty,\r\nbut somewhat improperly, since the power of rescinding sentences or of\r\nordering a new trial may reside in a mere executive authority, such\r\nas a court of cassation, which possesses none of the other attributes\r\nwhich we usually associate with a sovereign. In the constitution of the\r\nPrincipate it is certainly not regarded as a sovereign right, for the\r\npower is limited and, like most of the manifestations of public life, is\r\ntheoretically divided between the organs of the Republic and the Princeps.\r\n\r\nThe Senate possessed no general power of pardon beyond the right,\r\ninherited from the Republic, of annulling charges and thus releasing\r\npeople, who are on their trial, on certain public and festal\r\noccasions.[1858] This right of declaring _abolitiones publicae_ was one\r\nexpression of its right of amnesty.[1859] But the Senate had besides,\r\nas a high court, the right of rescinding its own former sentences (_in\r\nintegrum restitutio_).[1860] It might also be occasionally consulted by\r\nthe Princeps on the advisability of his rescinding the sentences of the\r\nimperial courts—those, as a rule, which had been pronounced by former\r\nEmperors.[1861] But such consultation was not a right of the Senate, but\r\nmerely a concession of the Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor, in his relation to the courts of Rome, possessed the full\r\npower of _restitutio_ only over his own sentences and those of his\r\npredecessors in office.[1862] He had no right of interference in the\r\nway of _restitutio_ with the judgments of the Senate, for the power\r\nwhich he possessed, of preventing the reception of the charge[1863] or\r\nthe execution of the judgment, was merely a practical and accidental\r\nconsequence of the application of the tribunician power to a decree of\r\nthe Senate.[1864] Nor is there any distinct evidence of his possessing\r\nthe power of rescinding the sentences of the _quaestiones perpetuae_,\r\nalthough interference with these on equitable grounds is not improbable,\r\nand seems, where permitted, to have taken the form of consent to a\r\nnew trial (_retratactio_).[1865] With respect to the ordinary civil\r\ncourts, the praetor possessed the power of equitable restitution,[1866]\r\nbut there is evidence that the Princeps, also as a court of equity,\r\nmight rescind inequitable sentences both of ordinary _judices_ and of\r\n_centumviri_.[1867]\r\n\r\nThe Princeps also possessed a power of quashing indictments (_abolitio_),\r\nwhich does not seem to have been confined to his own jurisdiction, but\r\nto have been extended to other criminal courts as well.[1868] Its origin\r\nmay be explained on two grounds. The first depends on the fact that it\r\nwas possible to have any case brought to the Emperor’s court, on the\r\nrequest either of the prosecutor or of the accused. The Emperor might,\r\nafter listening to the preliminaries, refuse to hear such a case without\r\n“remitting” it to another court,[1869] and it is very improbable that any\r\nother authority would listen for a moment to a prosecution to which the\r\nEmperor had declined to attend. The dismissal of the case by the Princeps\r\nwas practically a power of abolition; but the right might have been\r\nexercised even more directly. Republican history furnishes an instance\r\nof a tribune prohibiting the president of a _quaestio_ from receiving a\r\ncharge,[1870] and it is obvious that the _tribunicia potestas_ of the\r\nPrinceps might have been exercised in the same way to impede the first\r\nstep in the jurisdiction of every criminal court.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the provinces, just as the criminal appeal finally\r\npasses to the Emperor,[1871] so the revision of the sentences of the\r\nlocal courts, where revision is suggested by the judge,[1872] as well as\r\nthe infliction of punishments denied to the judge—such as the capital\r\npenalty on decurions or deportation on any one[1873]—centre finally in\r\nthe hands of the Princeps. All right of revision and restitution is not,\r\nindeed, denied to the provincial governor,[1874] but while this was\r\nfinally restricted by certain well-defined rules, the Emperor’s power of\r\nrestitution appears ultimately to have been unlimited. “This power might\r\nbe so employed by the Emperor as to take the form of a free pardon,[1875]\r\nbut theoretically it was merely an equitable assistance. As a legally\r\nunlimited power of rescinding sentences, it approaches very nearly to\r\na power of pardon; but it is an executive duty rather than a sovereign\r\nright, and we search in vain in the Principate for a power of pardon\r\nregarded as an admitted constitutional right of a sovereign.”[1876]\r\n\r\n(iii.) _Administration._—The principle of a dual control is as manifest\r\nin administrative matters as in any other. The spheres of administration\r\nare Rome, Italy, and the Provinces. With respect to the first two it\r\nis clear that one of the few justifications for the maintenance of\r\nRepublican government was that, by leaving the ordinary administrative\r\nduties connected with Rome and Italy to the Senate and ordinary\r\nmagistrates, it enabled the Princeps to concentrate his attention on his\r\nproper sphere, the foreign and provincial world. But even the provinces\r\ndid not deserve the undivided attention of the Princeps. Those whose\r\nadministration presented no special difficulties, and which required no\r\nmilitary force, might still be left to the care of the Roman people.\r\nThis division of responsibility might have continued a reality had the\r\nPrincipate continued to be what it was in origin—a provisional government\r\nby an individual who had little personal assistance at his command. But\r\nas this rule gradually assumed the form of a huge government department,\r\novershadowing all others, with an organised civil service which replaced\r\nthe assistance furnished by freedmen and slaves, it not unnaturally\r\ntended to encroach on the Republican spheres of administration. The\r\nmotive for the tendency was chiefly the fact that the Princeps was, in\r\nthe eyes of all men, not the head of a department but of the state, and\r\na responsibility, which he would gladly have disclaimed, for the acts of\r\nall officials, even those of Republican departments, was thus thrust upon\r\nhim.[1877] There is no particular ground for believing that the Princeps\r\nmanaged departments such as Rome or Italy better than the Republican\r\nofficials. The important fact was that public opinion forced him to\r\nmanage them, whether for good or ill.\r\n\r\n(iv.) _Finance._—Finance at Rome was always so intimately bound up with\r\nprovincial control, that the division of the provinces into public and\r\nimperial implied of itself the existence of two separate financial\r\ndepartments. The Senate still asserts control over the _aerarium_, and\r\ngives instructions to the guardians of the chest. The qualification of\r\nthese guardians varied from time to time. The dictator Caesar had in\r\n45 B.C. given the charge to two aediles, but quaestors seem again to\r\nhave been the presidents of the treasury[1878] until Augustus in 28\r\nB.C. instituted two _praefecti aerarii Saturni_, chosen yearly from the\r\nex-praetors by the Senate.[1879] Even this change was short-lived, and\r\nthe praefects were soon replaced by two of the praetors of the year who\r\nreceived their _provincia_ by lot.[1880] Claudius in 44 A.D. restored the\r\nRepublican method of administration through quaestors; but these were\r\nno longer to be annual officials designated by lot, but to be chosen by\r\nthe Emperor for a period of three years.[1881] Finally under Nero (56\r\nA.D.) the elements of the Augustan and the Claudian arrangements were\r\ncombined[1882] in the provision that two ex-praetors should be appointed\r\nas praefects of the treasury, but that these should be named, generally\r\nfor three years, by the Princeps.[1883] The fact that the Princeps\r\nappointed the guardians of the public chest was by no means an assertion\r\nthat he controlled its funds, and, although his indirect influence on\r\nthe _aerarium_ was unquestionably great, this treasury still remained in\r\nprinciple under the direction of the Senate alone. Even in the second\r\ncentury it voted a loan to Marcus Aurelius for carrying on a war.[1884]\r\n\r\nThe Princeps was rendered financially independent of the Senate through\r\nthe possession of his own treasury (_fiscus_ or _fiscus Caesaris_),[1885]\r\ninto which flowed the revenues from his own provinces, certain dues owed\r\nby the public provinces, and some extraordinary revenues, such as the\r\nconfiscated goods of condemned criminals or lapsed inheritances (_bona\r\ndamnatorum_, _bona vacantia_), in the claim to which the _fiscus_ finally\r\nreplaced the _aerarium_. The Princeps was the owner of the _fiscus_, but\r\nwas regarded as a trustee of the wealth which it contained. To sue the\r\n_fiscus_ was to sue the Princeps; but, although he was the sole subject\r\nof rights in relation to this treasury, he did not regard the money which\r\nit contained as though it were his own private property. Even in the\r\nearly Principate there is evidence of the existence of crown property\r\n(_patrimonium_ or _patrimonium privatum_), the use of which for private\r\npurposes was vested in the Princeps.[1886] The _patrimonium_ doubtless\r\ncommenced by being the strictly personal property of the first family\r\nof Caesars, and much of it was acquired by bequest;[1887] but, when the\r\nPrincipate had ceased to be hereditary in the Julian line, it seems to\r\nhave been looked on as crown property, which was heritable only by the\r\nsuccessor to the throne. The bequeathal of this property, which was\r\nimplied when the Princeps selected an heir, might thus be regarded as\r\na mode of designation; although, if the destined heir did not succeed,\r\nthe _patrimonium_ passed to his successful rival. It was probably due to\r\nthe uncertainty of the tenure of the _patrimonium_ that with Septimius\r\nSeverus we find the creation of a new aggregate of private property, the\r\n_res privata_,[1888] the administration of which was kept quite distinct\r\nfrom that of the _patrimonium_. All Caesar’s property, whether held in\r\ntrust for the state or for the crown, or applied to the needs of his\r\nfamily, was equally administered by his own private servants. Of these\r\nwe shall speak when we deal with the functionaries of the Princeps as a\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nAnother treasury under imperial control, which served a public purpose,\r\nwas that established for supplying pensions to discharged soldiers. The\r\nwant of it had been severely felt in the last years of the Republic,\r\nwhen the mercenary army looked for its final rewards to plunder or\r\nthe political influence of its generals; and, when Augustus created a\r\nprofessional army by the introduction of the long-service system, he\r\nfound it necessary to establish a pension fund for those who had given\r\ntwenty of the best years of their life to the practice of arms. The\r\nresult was the _aerarium militare_, which the Emperor endowed with a\r\nlarge capital,[1889] and to which, as fixed sources of revenue, the two\r\ntaxes of the _vicesima hereditatum_ and the _centesima rerum venalium_\r\nwere assigned.[1890] The administration of this chest was given to three\r\npraefects (_praefecti aerarii militaris_), who remained three years in\r\noffice, and were chosen from ex-praetors, originally by lot but later by\r\nthe Princeps.[1891]\r\n\r\n(v.) _Cultus._—In matters of religion and worship the dyarchy is again\r\napparent. So far as the state had a religious head, the Princeps, in\r\nvirtue of the chief pontificate, occupied this position, and we have\r\nseen the influence which this headship gave him.[1892] But the Senate\r\nhad not lost all its control over the cultus of the community or its\r\nright to pronounce on foreign worships, when their social merits or their\r\nlegality were in question. It is the Senate that is consulted on the\r\ngrowth of Egyptian and Jewish worship at Rome,[1893] and on the right\r\nof asylum in the provinces.[1894] Claudius questions it on the subject\r\nof the restoration of the college of _haruspices_,[1895] and Aurelian\r\nasks it for a pontifex to dedicate the great temple of the sun-god at\r\nPalmyra.[1896] So far as the appointment to the great priestly colleges\r\nwas not controlled by the Princeps, the gift of this honour was now in\r\nthe hands of the Senate.\r\n\r\n(vi.) _Coinage._—The right of coinage, although its possession by a\r\nstate may be taken as a mark of sovereign rights being enjoyed by that\r\ncommunity, is scarcely a significant mark of the sovereignty within a\r\nstate. Whether the Senate or the Princeps possessed this right would make\r\nlittle difference to the theory of the constitution. As a fact, the right\r\nwas possessed by both powers, and was an additional illustration of the\r\nprinciple of the dyarchy. From the year 15 B.C. the Princeps undertakes\r\nthe gold and silver coinage, the Senate that of copper. The possession of\r\nthe latter was a privilege in so far as the exchange value of copper was\r\nhigher than its intrinsic value, and payments of any amount could be made\r\nin what was really a token currency.[1897]\r\n\r\nWe have now exhibited the system of dual control as it existed in all the\r\nchief departments of the state. It would be easy to prove that in almost\r\nevery particular it might be made a fiction. The senatorial power of\r\nlegislation is directed to so large an extent by the imperial initiative\r\nthat the _oratio_ of the Princeps is sometimes cited in place of the\r\ndecree of the Senate to which it gave birth;[1898] the independence of\r\nsenatorial jurisdiction is often infringed by the tribunician power of\r\nthe Emperor, while his authority is directly or remotely in conflict\r\nwith that of the other courts at every turn; his praefects tend to\r\nusurp the administration of Rome and Italy, while his procurators are\r\na check on the activity of the proconsuls of the public provinces; his\r\ninfluence over the _aerarium_ can be asserted whenever he cares to take\r\nthe trouble to initiate or support in the Senate the proposal of a grant\r\nof money to himself.[1899] But such a control of departments, if wisely\r\nasserted, by no means rendered the dyarchy nugatory. Under a judicious\r\nprince the Republican constitution was sufficient for its own sphere in\r\nperhaps ninety-nine cases out of every hundred; because in the hundredth\r\nsome pressure was felt from the head of the state, we cannot pronounce\r\nthe dyarchy to be a fiction. If the control by the Princeps is brutally\r\nand unwisely, however legally, asserted, he is by common consent not a\r\nPrinceps but a tyrant. We must judge the Principate by its best names,\r\nby a Nerva, a Trajan, a Marcus Aurelius, an Alexander, a Decius. In\r\nthe reigns of all these princes the dyarchy is a living thing. If it\r\nis objected that it becomes a living thing merely through a concession\r\nof the Princeps, the answer is that this concession was certainly not\r\npictured by these Emperors to themselves as an act of grace, but was\r\nregarded as mere obedience to the constitution; and to maintain the\r\ntheory that a constitution which demands obedience from the wise is a\r\npalpable fiction because it cannot enforce obedience on the headstrong,\r\nis to wring a strange admission from political science.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 6. _The Senatorial and the Equestrian Nobility_\r\n\r\nAlthough the authority of the Princeps rested virtually on the support\r\nof the army, his position might have been unsafe, and would have been\r\nembarrassing, had he not secured for the work of administration at home\r\nand abroad an official class, that was dependent to some extent on\r\nimperial creation and, therefore, worked in harmony with himself. The old\r\nRepublican nobility, so far as it had not been extinguished, might be\r\nutilised; but it could be employed only by being kept in fetters, and by\r\npower being given to the Princeps to recruit its ranks at his will. We\r\nhave already considered his control of office, his right of _adlectio_,\r\nand his power of creating Patricians. But a wider power, cognate to\r\nthe gift of the Patriciate, was needed, to make him the patenter of a\r\nnobility from which alone senators and magistrates were to be chosen.\r\nSuch a power had been usurped by Augustus, and the recognition of a\r\n“senatorial order” was its result. Perhaps in the later Republic society\r\nhad already recognised the right of the prospective senator to wear the\r\nbroad scarlet stripe (_latus clavus_) on his tunic, but the right became\r\nmore clearly defined with the commencement of the Principate; and the\r\n_laticlavii_ are prospective senators and holders of Republican offices,\r\neither recognised as such by the Princeps or endowed by him with the\r\nsymbol of senatorial rank. The senator’s son possesses the right to wear\r\nthe _latus clavus_ and to attend the meetings of the _curia_, in which\r\nhe will one day take an active part;[1900] the eques to whom the symbol\r\nhas been given may qualify for the Senate through the vigintivirate and\r\nthe quaestorship. The first steps to office and to the Senate were, as\r\nwe have seen, usually through the army; but the young soldier who was\r\ndestined for the Senate differed, in service and in title, from his\r\npurely equestrian compeer. The _tribuni laticlavii_[1901] are a special\r\nclass of officers, who may often have started their service, as mounted\r\nofficers of the legions, with the brevet rank of tribune, and whose\r\nservice was shorter than that of the other equites in order that they\r\nmight be qualified for the quaestorship by the age of twenty-five.[1902]\r\nThe possessors of the _latus clavus_ must always have been expected to\r\npursue a senatorial career;[1903] by the time of Claudius they might be\r\ncompelled to this course, the penalty of refusal being the deprivation of\r\nthe broad stripe, but sometimes of equestrian rank as well.[1904]\r\n\r\nGreat care was taken to preserve the dignity and purity of this\r\nsenatorial order. The _latus clavus_ was granted only to those who could\r\ntrace free birth through four generations, and Claudius was forced to\r\nexcuse his conduct in giving it to a freedman’s son.[1905] The Julian\r\nmarriage laws prohibited marriage with freedwomen or actresses, not only\r\nto senators, but to their sons, grandsons, and great-grandsons.[1906]\r\n“The order” was reckoned to include the wives of senators and all\r\ndescendants in the male line,[1907] together with adoptive children,\r\nuntil they were emancipated, and even those natural children who had\r\nbeen emancipated.[1908] The commercial disabilities of senators were\r\nperpetuated and sharpened. The Republican prohibition that they should\r\nnot be purchasers of public contracts[1909] was renewed by an edict of\r\nHadrian.[1910] They were permitted to invest capital at a moderate rate\r\nof interest, but at times even this was disallowed.[1911]\r\n\r\nThese disabilities were, however, to some extent compensated by\r\nprivileges. As the senators ceased to be purely Roman, the question of\r\ntheir duties to their native states had to be considered, and the rule\r\nwas fixed that, while they were allowed to retain their domicile of\r\norigin (_origo_), they owed no public duties (_munera_) to the cities of\r\ntheir birth.[1912] We have already mentioned the growth of the principle\r\nwhich reserved criminal jurisdiction on a senator to the senatorial\r\ncourt.[1913]\r\n\r\nIn the early Principate there was no distinct title reserved for the\r\norder, but after the close of the first century the epithet _clarissimus_\r\ncame to be applied to its members, and the title _clarissima_ is even\r\ngiven to women of senatorial rank.[1914] A distinction in office and\r\ndignity but no distinction in rank separates the Princeps from the\r\nsenators. They are his “peers” (ὁμότιμοι),[1915] and this peerage is\r\nchiefly shown in their sole participation in Republican offices. They\r\nmight, indeed, be delegates of the Princeps, but not his servants in the\r\nsense in which the procurators were. Besides filling the regular offices\r\nof state, senators possessed a monopoly of provincial government, where\r\nthe country governed was a true _provincia_ and not a department assigned\r\ntemporarily or permanently to a procurator or praefect; they were the\r\nsole commanders of the legions, and, as Caesar’s nominees, they filled\r\nthe office of praefect of the city and the various commissionerships\r\n(_curationes_) for duties which he had undertaken, such as the care of\r\nthe water-supply, of the roads, of public works, and of the banks and\r\nchannel of the Tiber (_curatores aquarum, viarum, operum publicorum,\r\nalvei et riparum Tiberis_).[1916]\r\n\r\nWe have already spoken of the military training and attitude of this\r\nnobility,[1917] and also of its gradually increasing provincial\r\ncharacter.[1918] Both these characteristics were in harmony with its\r\nsphere of duties, which were mainly provincial. A successful member of\r\nthe order could have seen but little of Rome or Italy until his declining\r\nyears. If his early military service was real and not nominal,[1919] he\r\nspent most of the years between eighteen and twenty-five in the camps and\r\non the frontiers. If he had shown military ability, he might be sent back\r\nas an ex-quaestor to take command of a legion, although such a legateship\r\nwas usually reserved to men of praetorian rank.[1920] The praetorship\r\nand consulship qualified him for long terms of service in successive\r\nCaesarian provinces, and for the annual governorship of those still under\r\nthe control of the Senate.[1921] This identification with provincial life\r\nwas an identification with the Principate, for there were few Republican\r\nassociations to impress the mind when the bounds of Italy had been\r\npassed. The principles of selection, training, and habituation to which\r\nthis nobility was subject were thus directed to inspire it with a belief\r\nin, if not with an enthusiasm for, the accepted order of things.\r\n\r\nThe second order which supported the throne and did the work of the\r\nEmpire was that of the Equites. The word _eques_ has now, as in the\r\nRepublic, a dual signification. Tacitus employs it to describe the\r\ncapitalist class, presumably the possessors of a census of 400,000\r\nsesterces,[1922] and it is obvious that current terminology did not\r\naccept the restrictions which the Principate may have wished to impose on\r\nthe use of the term. It is uncertain what these restrictions were, for\r\nliterature and inscriptions mention two methods of conferring equestrian\r\nrank, and it is not known whether these methods—the gift of the rank\r\nthrough the gold ring and through the public horse—were sometimes\r\nalternative or always concurrent. But the grant of knighthood to freedmen\r\nis described as having been effected by the gift of the gold ring[1923]—a\r\ngift which, as early as the time of Hadrian, had come to confer free\r\nbirth (_ingenuitas_) merely and not equestrian rank,[1924] and it cannot\r\nbe shown that the public horse was always given to members of this class\r\nwhen they were endowed with the _insignia_ of knighthood.[1925] It is\r\nnot improbable, however, that when the gold ring had lost its earlier\r\nsignification and become merely a means of conferring free birth, only\r\none order of official equites was recognised, and that the title in its\r\nproper sense was restricted to the order whose members had, from the\r\ntime of Augustus, been pre-eminently the bearers of the name. This order\r\nwas the old one of the _equites equo publico_, which was reorganised\r\nand vastly extended in scale at the very beginning of the Principate. We\r\nare told that even under Augustus the annual parade might witness the\r\nappearance of five thousand knights,[1926] and these could have been\r\nbut a portion of the order, for many members of the corps must have\r\nbeen detained on financial, administrative, and military duties in the\r\nprovinces. This increase in numbers seems to have led to the abandonment\r\nof the old centuriate organisation, for the equites of the Principate\r\nare grouped in _turmae_ and commanded by _seviri_.[1927] Selection for\r\nthe order was entirely in the hands of the Princeps,[1928] and probably\r\nany one with the requisite qualifications—free birth, good character,\r\nand a property of 400,000 sesterces—could get this patent of nobility\r\nfrom the Emperor’s hands. At the times when the censorship was revived\r\nin the person of the Princeps,[1929] the selection and elimination of\r\nequites may have followed the rules prevailing under the Republican\r\nsystem of revision;[1930] but, as the censorship was no part of the\r\nconstitution of the Principate, some department must have existed from\r\nthe first for the purpose of registering the names of applicants. We find\r\na permanent bureau eventually established for this purpose. It bore the\r\ntitle _a censibus equitum Romanorum_, and seems to have been a branch of\r\nthe general department of petitions (_a libellis_).[1931] Although this\r\noffice was concerned primarily with the duty of admission to the order,\r\nyet its holders must have pointed out to the Princeps cases where the\r\nqualifications requisite for knighthood had ceased to exist, and they\r\nmust thus have acted as the board that really controlled the tenure of\r\nthe rank. The formal control in this particular was, however, effected,\r\nnow as in the Republic, by a solemn and public act. The act, although\r\na Republican survival, was not employed with its Republican meaning.\r\nThe parade of the knights (_transvectio equitum_) on the Ides of July\r\nhad, during the Republic, been a mere procession; it was now given the\r\nsignificance of the censorian review in the Forum,[1932] and became the\r\nmeans of testing the qualifications of members of the order (_probatio\r\nequitum_).[1933] The knights now passed on horseback, not on foot; they\r\ncould not ask for their discharge (_missio_), for the tenure of their\r\nrank was no longer conditioned by military service, although Augustus\r\nfinally permitted all members of the age of thirty-five, who were\r\nunwilling to continue in the corps, to return their public horses;[1934]\r\nbut the knights were still questioned and made to give an account of\r\ntheir conduct,[1935] and those whose answers were unsatisfactory were\r\ndismissed from the ranks.[1936] That Augustus took this duty seriously is\r\nshown by the fact that he more than once asked the Senate for committees,\r\nwhether of three or ten members, to assist him in the work.[1937] But,\r\nalthough this parade is found in the reigns of subsequent Emperors,[1938]\r\nand can be traced as late as the fourth century A.D.,[1939] the serious\r\nduty of rejection was probably exercised more and more by the permanent\r\nbureau which admitted to the order.\r\n\r\nThe eighteen centuries of Roman knights had, even at the end of the\r\nRepublic, never lost touch with the army. They had ceased to be the\r\ncitizen cavalry, but they were composed of the young nobility who\r\nfurnished the mounted officers of the legions. This secondary military\r\ncharacter was retained by the corps in the Principate; but it had an\r\nadditional significance as well. There can be no doubt that it was from\r\nthe _equites equo publico_ that the Emperors chose those members of the\r\nofficial hierarchy—procurators and praefects—who were of equestrian rank.\r\nIt is less certain whether this corps furnished all the _judices_ during\r\nthe early Principate. Jurisdiction, whether civil or criminal, was a\r\nburden (_munus_), and this may have been imposed on all who possessed\r\nthe requisite census, whether they had made profession for the order or\r\nnot.[1940]\r\n\r\nIt was natural that an order thus definitely constituted, and which\r\nbecame more rigid as time went on, should end by enjoying titles of\r\nhonour peculiar to itself. This stage had been attained by the second\r\ncentury; but the titular designations are not strictly those of the\r\nequestrian order, but of the grades of office to which it led. After the\r\nreign of Marcus Aurelius the equestrian hierarchy was divided into three\r\nclasses; the first contained only the praefect of the praetorian guard\r\nwho was called _vir eminentissimus_; the second the other equestrian\r\npraefects and higher procurators, who bore the title _perfectissimi_; the\r\nthird—the possessors of all other equestrian posts—were _egregii_.[1941]\r\nThe equestrian officers of the army were not graduated on a similar scale\r\nof rank, and the municipal knights of Italy are designated only by the\r\nold Republican and non-official epithet of _splendidi_.[1942] The more\r\ndefinite, but equally non-official, epithet of _illustris_ may have\r\nbeen applied to individuals who possessed the senatorial census and the\r\n_latus clavus_, but who were passing through the equestrian service in\r\nthe army (_equestris militia_), which was preparatory to entrance into\r\nthe Senate.[1943] But the name more particularly designated men who,\r\npossessed of a senatorial fortune, preferred to retain their equestrian\r\nrank, and even perhaps any equites of fortune and dignity such as the\r\nholders of the great praefectures.[1944]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 7. _The Functionaries of the Princeps_\r\n\r\nThe Princeps, since he is not a king, has neither magistrates nor\r\nministers subject to his will; but he possesses a number of delegates\r\nand servants who assist in the performance of his vast duties of\r\nadministration. Some of these, such as the legates, praefects, and\r\ncurators, find analogies in the Republican constitution; others, such\r\nas the procurators and secretaries of departments, are borrowed from\r\nthe organisation of a Roman household and are transferred from the life\r\nof the palace to that of the state. We may neglect for the moment the\r\nlegates and provincial praefects, who will be considered in the section\r\ndealing with the organisation of the provinces, and fix our attention on\r\nthe offices of the central government, which are either peculiar to Rome\r\nand Italy or common to them and the provincial world.\r\n\r\n(i.) _The Praefects._—The four great praefectures, which were concerned\r\noriginally with the administration of Italy and Rome, were those of\r\nthe city (_urbi_), the praetorian guard (_praetorio_), the corn-supply\r\n(_annonae_), and the watch (_vigilum_). Of these the first stands\r\nentirely out of relation to the others so far as the career and\r\nqualification of its holders were concerned; for, while the praefecture\r\nof the city was a senatorial post, all the others were, during the\r\ngreater part of the Principate, equestrian. Of the three latter offices\r\nthe praefecture of the praetorian guard was the highest in rank, next\r\ncame that of the corn-supply, and thirdly that of the watch.[1945]\r\n\r\nThe praefecture of the city was the continuation in name, and to some\r\nextent in functions, of one of the oldest offices in Rome;[1946] but\r\nthe historical continuity is rendered somewhat imperfect by the fact\r\nthat the ancient praefecture, which had originated with the kings and\r\nhad ceased to be a reality only with the appointment of the first\r\npraetor,[1947] still continued in a shadowy form during the Principate\r\nas the praefecture created when the days of the Latin festival drew the\r\nmagistrates away from Rome.[1948] But the new office of the Principate\r\nwas, in a sense, a continuation of the old one of the monarchy. Both were\r\nproducts of personal rule and were based on the theory of delegation; the\r\nlater office was suggested by the earlier, and both had much the same\r\nsphere of administration. The link between the Republican office and that\r\nof the Principate is found in the arrangements of the dictator Caesar\r\nand in the earlier procedure of Augustus. The link was broken when,\r\nunder Tiberius, the praefecture became a permanent and not an occasional\r\noffice. In 46 B.C. Caesar had left six _praefecti_ in Rome to administer\r\nthe affairs of the city during his absence;[1949] Maecenas had had a\r\nsimilar, though less definite, position given him by Augustus;[1950] and\r\nwhen the latter became Princeps, the praefecture between the years 27 and\r\n24 B.C. became a more regular, although still an occasional office, and\r\nwas renewed from time to time by Augustus during his absences from the\r\ncapital.[1951] Tiberius’ long periods of retirement made it practically\r\nperpetual,[1952] and under subsequent reigns the praefect remains in\r\noffice even when the Princeps is present in Rome.[1953] It was, perhaps,\r\ndue to its associations with the Republican magistracy that this office\r\nwas filled by a senator and a consular.[1954] The same associations may\r\naccount for the facts that the praefect of the city, although a delegate\r\nof the Princeps and nominated by him for an indefinite period,[1955] is\r\nyet accounted a magistrate, and is even credited with _imperium_.[1956]\r\n\r\nOne of the early occupants of the office[1957] sent in his resignation\r\nsix days after his appointment on the ground that he had held an\r\n_incivilis potestas_; and indeed the scope of the praefect’s duties\r\nand the extent of summary jurisdiction and coercive power which they\r\ninvolved, might easily lead a sensitive mind to shrink from such\r\nun-Republican authority. The praefect was briefly the guardian of the\r\ncity (_custos urbis_), and nothing that could be construed as a part of\r\nthat _tutela_[1958] was exempt from his control. It was his duty to keep\r\norder everywhere, at the games as in the market, and for this purpose he\r\nhad at his disposal the city cohorts (_cohortes urbanae_) established by\r\nAugustus,[1959] three divisions of which were quartered in Rome during\r\nthe reign of Tiberius.[1960] But the preservation of order implied\r\ninterference with a great many departments of civic life. The praefect\r\ncontrolled the theatre, the money-changers, the sale of meat, the\r\ntrading and religious guilds; he listened to the grievances of slaves,\r\nor to the complaints of _patroni_ about their freedmen, and finally\r\neven had cognisance of serious offences committed by guardians.[1961]\r\nThe criminal jurisdiction, which was the complement of his authority,\r\nwas so indefinite that at a very early period it crossed that of the\r\n_quaestiones perpetuae_,[1962] and, as the tendency of the Principate was\r\nto make the latter give way before the former, we are not surprised at\r\nthe unlimited criminal jurisdiction described by Dio Cassius and recorded\r\nin the _Digest_ as vested in the praefect in the third century A.D.[1963]\r\nHe might at this time inflict the severest punishments, even deportation\r\nor condemnation to the mines.[1964] His police control and criminal\r\njurisdiction extended to the limit of a hundred miles from Rome.[1965]\r\nWithin the city he might judge in person; jurisdiction in Italy he\r\nexercised through delegates.[1966] He also possessed a certain civil\r\njurisdiction connected with his functions of preserving order,[1967] and\r\nfinally became the court of appeal, in civil cases, from officials in\r\nRome.[1968] But he was not a final court, for a further appeal lay from\r\nthe praefect to the Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe _praefectus praetorio_ was in origin the commander of the Emperor’s\r\nbodyguard. This _corps d’élite_, which even in the Republic had grouped\r\nitself round a commander in the field, was given a definite existence and\r\norganisation in the year 28 B.C.,[1969] and became the police of Italy,\r\nthe selected home force composed, unlike the legions, mainly of Italian\r\ncitizens,[1970] and the protector, often the transmitter, of the throne.\r\nIts praefects at this early stage represent the military character of\r\nthe despotism perhaps more purely than any other officials, and even\r\nthe reign of the second Caesar could show in Sejanus one of the most\r\nformidable of those praefects who were almost partners of the throne.\r\nThe danger threatened by the office illustrates its power, and this was\r\nrecognised when Vespasian sought security by giving the praefecture to\r\nhis own son Titus,[1971] or Severus married his elder son to the daughter\r\nof his praefect Plautianus.[1972] A more favourite method was to increase\r\nthe number of its holders. Two were frequently appointed, and three\r\nare found on two occasions since the time of Commodus.[1973] Gradually\r\nthe military functions of the office ceased to be the most important,\r\nalthough its military history had determined its character. The praefect\r\nof the guard had always been the man who stood next the throne; he was a\r\ntruer _alter ego_ of the Princeps than the praefect of the city, for his\r\nactivity was not confined to Rome and Italy. It was he who issued rapid\r\ninjunctions for the organisation of the army or for the guidance of the\r\ncivil service throughout the Empire, and at times we find two praefects,\r\nsuch as Adventus and Macrinus in the reign of Caracalla, representing\r\nrespectively the military and civil spheres. But jurisdiction, the most\r\nconstant of the Emperor’s cares, and the framing of legal decrees, also\r\ndemanded the attention of the praefect, and hence it was necessary to\r\nentrust the office to the first jurists of the Empire. Papinian, Ulpian,\r\nand Paulus were all praefects of the guard. The change in the character\r\nof the office perhaps began with Hadrian; it was carried on during\r\nthe reigns of the Antonine Emperors, and finally achieved in that of\r\nSeptimius Severus. The judicial aspect of the office was now paramount.\r\nThe praefect has become the highest criminal judge in Italy outside the\r\nhundredth milestone;[1974] he is the court of appeal in criminal cases\r\nfrom all provincial governors,[1975] and judges in those cases which the\r\nprovincial governor was not competent to decide.[1976] He is also the\r\ncourt of appeal from provincial governors in civil cases.[1977] This\r\nextensive jurisdiction was a result of the centralisation of judicial\r\npower in the Emperor, which we have already traced.[1978] It had to be\r\ndelegated, and no fitter delegate could be found than the praefect.\r\nConvenience also dictated that the delegation should be final, and the\r\nprinciple was finally arrived at that there should be no appeal from\r\nthe praefect to the Emperor.[1979] This did not mean that the Emperor\r\nceased to judge; for at any moment he might displace his praefect and\r\nhear the case himself. As the praefect judged _vice principis_, it is\r\nnatural to suppose that he presided over the imperial _consilium_,[1980]\r\nwhich attained a definite organisation in the reign of Hadrian;[1981]\r\nand this probability is scarcely shaken by the fact that we find special\r\n_consiliarii_ nominated for the praefect,[1982] for he exercised a\r\nvaried jurisdiction and might be holding a court at the same time as the\r\nEmperor. Apart from jurisdiction, his general mandates and ordinances had\r\nlegal force, provided that they did not conflict with laws or imperial\r\nconstitutions.[1983]\r\n\r\nDuring the greater part of the Principate equestrian rank was a necessary\r\nqualification for this praefecture. Senators first began to hold this\r\noffice from the time of Severus Alexander, who gave his praefects\r\n_senatoria dignitas_ and the title _clarissimus_,[1984] for it was\r\nheld that one who pronounced judgment on a senator should himself be\r\nof senatorial rank.[1985] At the time when the praefect was a knight,\r\ndismissal from office often took the form of making him a senator or a\r\nmember of the senatorial order.[1986]\r\n\r\nThe _praefectus annonae_ was the final product of a question that had\r\nnever ceased to agitate Rome from the close of the Punic wars. Anxiety\r\nabout the supply of corn to the capital had raised Pompeius to an\r\nextraordinary position in 57 B.C.,[1987] and in 43 the Senate, alarmed\r\nat the possible designs of Antonius and Octavian, had agreed that no\r\nindividual _curator_ for corn should again be appointed.[1988] In the\r\nearly Principate the duty belonged technically to the _aediles cereales_\r\ninstituted by Caesar;[1989] but epochs of scarcity led to its being\r\ntaken over by the Princeps. Augustus accepted the task in 22 B.C.,[1990]\r\nbut whether as a permanent cura is uncertain,[1991] and in 18 B.C. and\r\n6 A.D. experiments were made to carry it through by the appointment\r\nof _curatores_ of praetorian or consular rank.[1992] Finally, as a\r\ndefinite _cura_ of the Princeps, it was given to a praefect. The _cura\r\nannonae_ as undertaken by the Princeps involved two charges; firstly,\r\nthe gratuitous distribution of corn to the poorer classes at Rome, and\r\nsecondly, the placing of corn on the Roman market for purchasers as well\r\nas recipients. It was with the latter of these duties that the praefect\r\nwas chiefly, perhaps exclusively, concerned.[1993] He had to see that\r\nthe requisite mass of grain was brought to the market, and that it was\r\nsold at a moderate and stable price.[1994] Assistance was furnished\r\nhim by subordinate officials in Rome itself, in the harbours of Italy,\r\nand in the provinces, senatorial as well as imperial; but the number\r\nof these procurators was not large, since the lower departments of the\r\ncorn-supply were managed by guilds, such as those of the _mensores_\r\nand _navicularii_,[1995] “associations that originally leased their\r\nservices to the state and finally became its instruments.”[1996] The\r\npraefect possessed a jurisdiction arising from his administrative\r\nduties. He listened to criminal informations touching the public supply\r\nof corn,[1997] and seems even to have heard certain civil actions\r\narising out of the corn trade.[1998] The appeal from his judgment went\r\nimmediately to the Emperor.[1999]\r\n\r\nThe institution of the _praefectus vigilum_ was equally the result of\r\nthe Emperor’s undertaking a special department of administration that\r\nhad formerly belonged to Republican magistrates. The guardianship of the\r\ntown against fires and nocturnal disturbances had belonged chiefly to the\r\n_triumviri capitales_,[2000] and in a more general way to the aediles.\r\nBut the Republican appliances were found insufficient, and Augustus\r\nformed an early scheme for giving the curule aediles a fire-brigade of\r\nsix hundred slaves.[2001] Even this did not prove satisfactory, and in\r\nA.D. 6 he undertook the new _cura_—an undertaking which was followed by\r\nthe establishment of seven cohorts of _vigiles_, one for every two of the\r\nfourteen regions of the city, and the creation of a praefect set over the\r\ntribunes who were commanders of these divisions.[2002] This praefecture\r\nwas, like that of the corn-supply, equestrian, and the two differ little\r\nin rank; for, although the _praefectura annonae_ was reckoned superior,\r\ndirect promotion from the command of the _vigiles_ to that of the\r\npraetorian guard is found.[2003] The praefect protected the town and\r\npatrolled the streets by night, and he exercised a jurisdiction closely\r\nconnected with his police functions, and resembling, in a lower degree,\r\nthat of the praefect of the city. He tried cases of arson, robbery,\r\nburglary, and thefts in baths;[2004] but the higher jurisdiction in such\r\ncases belonged to the _praefectus urbi_, and the praefect of the watch\r\ncould not try Roman citizens on capital charges.[2005] In the third\r\ncentury he possessed some civil jurisdiction in matters connected with\r\nleases and house-rent.[2006]\r\n\r\n(ii.) _The Curators._—There were certain _curae_ undertaken by Augustus\r\nwhich he did not give to equestrian praefects, but to senatorial\r\n_curatores_. These _curae_ of the roads of Italy, of the public works,\r\nof the public water-supply, and of the channel and banks of the Tiber\r\n(_viarum, operum publicorum, aquarum publicarum, alvei et riparum\r\nTiberis_), were filled by nomination of the Princeps, but their holders\r\nwere perhaps, like the praefects of the _aerarium_, regarded as officials\r\nof the people or of the Senate rather than of the Emperor; the reason for\r\nthis view probably being that the care of the roads, _opera publica_,\r\nand the like was concerned with _solum publicum_, and “the public soil\r\nin Rome and Italy was, even after the foundation of the Principate, not\r\nthe property of the Emperor but of the people or the Senate.”[2007] Hence\r\nin the early Principate the pecuniary means for this administration was\r\nguaranteed from the _aerarium_, the _fiscus_ merely contributing.[2008]\r\nHence too the occupation of these posts by senators and their method\r\nof appointment. In 11 B.C. Augustus nominated _curatores aquarum_\r\nwith the consent of the Senate (_ex consensu senatus, ex senatus\r\nauctoritate_);[2009] the _curatores operum publicorum_ and _viarum_ were\r\nperhaps nominated in the same way, and the _curatores_ of the Tiber were\r\nin Tiberius’ reign appointed by lot.[2010]\r\n\r\n(iii.) _The Procurators._—The quasi-magisterial position of the occupants\r\nof the higher imperial posts could not be reflected in the lower grades\r\nof office. So far as the detailed _ministeria principatus_[2011] were\r\nconcerned, the Princeps adopted the analogy of the Roman house, not of\r\nthe Roman state, and employed either general agents (_procuratores_)\r\nor assistants designated by the secretarial or other duty which they\r\nperformed (_ab epistulis_, _a rationibus_, etc.). There was always a\r\ndistinction between the two classes, which was still preserved now\r\nthat they had become official. The agent of domestic life might indeed\r\napproximate to the condition of a mere bailiff, and might be a slave; but\r\nthe necessity for representing the absent _dominus_ in courts of law had\r\nmade it convenient that the procurator should be a free man; and the idea\r\nof agency, usually of general agency (_procuratio omnium rerum_),[2012]\r\nwas closely associated with the word. On the other hand, the slaves and\r\nfreedmen of the household who copied and kept accounts, were not agents;\r\nand, in accordance with this distinction, the officials of the Principate\r\nwho bear such titles as _ab epistulis_, _a libellis_, _a rationibus_, are\r\nnot spoken of as procurators, although one of these posts might rise to\r\nthe dignity of a procuratorship, as that _a rationibus_ did.\r\n\r\nAlthough from the point of view of functions the two classes must be kept\r\ndistinct, from that of qualification they may be discussed together.\r\nIn both we observe the tendency for the household to become a bureau,\r\nfor the freedman and slave to give place to the Roman knight. Tiberius’\r\nhousehold consisted mainly of freedmen,[2013] and their influence reached\r\nits zenith in the reign of Claudius. An Emperor who sought popularity\r\nmight, like Vitellius, transfer the _ministeria_ of the Principate to\r\nRoman knights;[2014] but no comprehensive attempt seems to have been\r\nmade to reorganise the bureaucracy on this footing until the time of\r\nHadrian.[2015] Henceforth the higher grades were held as a rule by\r\nknights, only the lower being possessed indifferently by equites or\r\nfreedmen.[2016] The procuratorship was the patent of equestrian nobility\r\n(_equestris nobilitas_),[2017] and we have seen that titles were finally\r\ndevised to express the differences in procuratorial rank.[2018] The civil\r\nservice now became closely connected with the army, and the occupants of\r\ncivil posts were mainly retired officers, men who had held at least one\r\nof the three positions in the equestrian service,[2019] and who, after\r\nthe second century, had generally filled every grade before they took the\r\nprocuratorship.[2020] This militarising of the administrative service is\r\none of the most curious features of the Principate. It gave that service\r\nits precision, its rigidity, its tendency to work as a smooth machine\r\nalmost independently of personal control. This tendency was a blessing\r\nin so far as it was calculated to diminish the influence due to the\r\nidiosyncrasies of the Princeps, or of any individual holder of office;\r\nbut one cannot help suspecting that a great deal of the administrative\r\ntyranny, which darkened the closing years of the Principate and weakened\r\nthe Empire, was due to the ineradicable habits of routine inspired by a\r\nmilitary life, and that the Greek or Graeco-Asiatic freedman, although\r\na more corrupt, was, on the whole, a more capable administrator. The\r\nmilitary supply was not, however, altogether sufficient, and from the\r\ntime of Hadrian a civil career was also open, which gave a chance to the\r\naspiring lawyer.\r\n\r\nTheoretically the procurator’s duties were those of mere agency, and\r\nhe had little discretionary authority and no general official power.\r\nTiberius’ emphatic statement that his procurator’s business was merely\r\nto manage the Emperor’s slaves and personal property[2021] is echoed in\r\nthe language of the _Digest_, which tells us that the duties of these\r\nservants of the Emperor were strictly defined, that they were accountable\r\nto their master for the use made of the finances or property under their\r\ncare, that they could not give, sell, or transfer it, and that “careful\r\nmanagement” was the limit of their power.[2022] It was only when they\r\nkept within these bounds that their acts had all the authority of\r\nthose of the Princeps himself.[2023] But the extending spheres of their\r\noperations rendered it impossible for these limits to be rigorously\r\npreserved. Claudius asked and obtained that his procurators should be\r\npermitted jurisdiction within their own financial departments[2024]—an\r\nalmost necessary result of the fact that in the provinces (and especially\r\nin those under senatorial management) there was no convenient court\r\nof arbitration to decide when money was or was not owing to the\r\nPrinceps.[2025] The consent of the Princeps, also, to the procurator’s\r\nacts must eventually have meant the consent of the chief bureau at Rome;\r\nfor, in spite of the extraordinary capacity for personal government\r\npossessed by the Roman Emperors, the fiscal system was too complicated\r\nfor every detail to reach their ears.\r\n\r\nThe chief duties of the procurators were financial, and most of\r\nthese agents can be summed up under the title _procuratores fisci_.\r\nA number of titles are met with which clearly have reference to the\r\ncentral department at Rome. Such are _procurator summarum_ found in an\r\ninscription of Nero’s time and borne by a freedman,[2026] _procuratores\r\nrationum summarum_,[2027] _rationalis summae rei_,[2028] _dispensator_\r\nor _dispensator summarum_,[2029] and _vilicus summarum_.[2030] The\r\ntitles belong to different epochs, and it is difficult to establish\r\ntheir precise import. It is generally agreed that from the time of\r\nClaudius the title _a rationibus_ was reserved for the chief controller\r\nof the _fiscus_. After the reign of Hadrian this post was reserved\r\nfor equites,[2031] and the members of the central bureau had a higher\r\nstanding than the financial agents in the provinces. The title\r\n_procurator rationum summarum_, which belongs to the second century,\r\ndenotes some highly placed official connected with this central chest;\r\nbut, as it does not seem to be identical with the title _a rationibus_,\r\nit has been thought to represent a subordinate controller perhaps\r\ninstituted by Marcus Aurelius.[2032] The title _rationalis_, which was\r\noften identical with _procurator_,[2033] seems at some period within the\r\nthird century to have replaced _a rationibus_ as the designation of the\r\nchief officer of the _fiscus_.[2034]\r\n\r\nAmongst provincial procurators we may enumerate first those who were\r\nconfined to the imperial provinces. The procurator here occupied the\r\nposition which the quaestor held in the public provinces; he was the\r\nchief officer of the provincial _fiscus_, collected the taxes due\r\nto it, and managed the disbursement of its funds. There was also a\r\ntreasury connected with the military station in the province (_fiscus\r\ncastrensis_), and at the head of it a _procurator castrensis_, who\r\nsuperintended the payments made to the soldiers,[2035] and military\r\nexpenses in general. Other procurators were common to all the provinces;\r\nfor even those that were “public” paid certain dues to the Emperor.[2036]\r\nSuch were lapsed legacies and the goods of the condemned (_bona caduca_\r\nand _damnatorum_), after the _fiscus_ had asserted its claim to these\r\nrevenues,[2037] and the taxes owed by Roman citizens everywhere, such\r\nas the _vicesima hereditatum_ and the _centesima rerum venalium_. But\r\nthe public provinces owed more direct dues to the Princeps as well. Thus\r\nAfrica, a corn-supplying but not an imperial province, was brought into\r\nthe closest relation with his _cura annonae_, and even the most peaceful\r\ndistricts must have defrayed the expense of the necessary military\r\nprotection, and surrendered certain revenues to be collected by imperial\r\nofficials.\r\n\r\nCommon, too, to all the provinces were the agents who managed\r\nthe imperial estates (_procuratores patrimonii_ or _patrimonii\r\nprivati_).[2038] We have already noticed that after the time of Severus\r\na distinction was drawn between the _res privata_ and the _patrimonium_\r\nof the Emperor.[2039] From this time onward the _procurator rerum\r\nprivatarum_ is distinct from the _procurator patrimonii_.[2040]\r\n\r\nThe non-financial procurators, who were actually governors of districts,\r\nwill be discussed when we are dealing with the organisation of the\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\nThe tenure of office by a procurator was indefinite, and depended on the\r\nimperial pleasure. Technically their posts expired when the Princeps who\r\nhad appointed them died,[2041] and the renewal of their office by his\r\nsuccessor, although it must have been the rule, was treated as a new\r\nappointment. The posts were well paid and procurators bore the titles\r\n_trecenarius_, _ducenarius_, _centenarius_, and _sexagenarius_, according\r\nas their salaries varied from 300,000 to 60,000 sesterces. The salaries\r\nof the procurators at Rome were probably higher than those belonging to\r\nthe same departments in Italy and in the provinces. Thus the _procuratio\r\nrationis privatae_ was probably in Rome a _trecenaria_, in the provinces\r\na _ducenaria_, in Italy, where it would be merely a branch of the\r\ncentral office, a _centenaria procuratio_.[2042] Promotion seems to have\r\nbeen determined chiefly by merit, and one of the strong points of the\r\nsystem was that there was no mechanical system of advancement. It was\r\npossible for a secretary, who had never been a procurator proper, to be\r\nappointed to a praefecture,[2043] but, as a rule, several procuratorships\r\nwere passed through before this summit of equestrian ambition was\r\nattained.[2044]\r\n\r\n(iv.) _Personal Assistants._—The secretariate of the Principate was,\r\nas we have seen, but the business side of the organisation of a Roman\r\nhousehold, but so rapidly did the importance and official aspect of\r\nthese posts develop that already by Nero’s reign a Roman noble, who kept\r\nassistants with such titles as _ab epistulis_ and _a libellis_, might be\r\nsuspected of treasonable designs.[2045] These secretaryships became, in\r\nfact though not in law, great offices of state. They required more highly\r\ntrained ability than most of the procuratorships, and, as they brought\r\ntheir holders into close relations with the Princeps, the influence and\r\nthe power of patronage which they conferred must have been enormous.\r\n\r\nThe official _ab epistulis_ put into shape all the decisions of the\r\nPrinceps which took the form of letters, so far as these were not written\r\npersonally by the Princeps himself. The answers to the _consultationes_\r\nof officials, to the despatches of generals and provincial governors, or\r\nto deputations from foreign communities, together with the nomination of\r\nofficials and officers and the conferment of privileges, passed through\r\nhis hands.[2046]\r\n\r\nThe official _a libellis_ drew up the answers to petitions (_preces_,\r\n_libelli_)[2047] made by private individuals to the Emperor. The\r\nanswer was generally given in a short _subscriptio_ appended to the\r\ndocument.[2048] The framing of such replies required considerable legal\r\nknowledge; hence it is not surprising to find that jurists like Papinian\r\nand Ulpian held this post.\r\n\r\nThe official _a cognitionibus_ was the adviser of the Emperor on legal\r\npoints, which were settled by imperial decree. The points on which\r\nadvice was given were perhaps wholly those of civil jurisdiction,\r\nand were probably such as did not need to come before the imperial\r\n_consilium_.[2049] The office was in existence at the beginning of the\r\nthird century,[2050] but is thought to have been subsequently merged in\r\nthat _a libellis_.[2051]\r\n\r\nThe official _a memoria_ is first mentioned about the time of the Emperor\r\nCaracalla. His function was probably to put into form and reduce to\r\nwriting (often by dictation to a secretary)[2052] such speeches and\r\nverbal decisions of the Emperor as did not fall under the competence of\r\nthe other officials.\r\n\r\n(v.) _The Consilium._—The _consilium_ of the Princeps[2053] was merely\r\na renewed manifestation of that eternal principle of Roman public\r\nlife which directed that a magistrate should seek advisers. A council\r\nwas necessary for public confidence, but an imperial _consilium_ was\r\noriginally no part of the constitution of the Principate. Tiberius\r\nimitated Augustus in seeking advice before coming to a decision on\r\nimportant matters;[2054] yet when he sat as a high court of criminal\r\njurisdiction, his board of assessors could be described as consisting\r\nof a “few friends.”[2055] The board may have become more determinate in\r\nsucceeding reigns, but the first Princeps whom we hear of as giving it\r\na definite organisation was Hadrian. That Emperor, we are told, when\r\nhe held a court of justice, summoned as his advisers jurisconsults\r\napproved by the Senate.[2056] It is only a _judicial_ council that is\r\nhere described, and there is nothing to show that these legal experts\r\nwere necessarily consulted on administrative matters. The basis,\r\nhowever, was laid for a permanent council of state, and the _consiliarii\r\nAugusti_ of this period became a definite and salaried class.[2057]\r\nThey included both senators and equites,[2058] and some bore the title\r\n_jurisperiti_.[2059] Others may not have been gifted with special\r\nknowledge of the law, and may have been employed in cases where general\r\nability or experience may have been of more value than juristic training.\r\nActual jurisdiction was not, however, the only occasion on which legal\r\nknowledge was indispensable in an adviser. The help of the jurist had to\r\nbe sought in the framing of the imperial _constitutiones_,[2060] and we\r\nare told that for this purpose Severus Alexander was assisted by twenty\r\n_jurisperiti_ out of a _consilium_ numbering seventy in all.[2061] A\r\ndifference of personnel for different branches of administration is\r\neasily comprehensible, for it is improbable that the Emperor needed\r\nto summon all his councillors on every occasion on which he took\r\nadvice.[2062] The mode of consultation was wholly informal and depended\r\non the discretion of the Princeps. Augustus in the exercise of his\r\njurisdiction distributed voting tablets (_tabellae_) to his councillors,\r\non which they could inscribe acquittal or condemnation or a modified\r\nverdict.[2063] We cannot imagine that the votes were reckoned as in the\r\njury system. The _tabellae_ were for the enlightenment of the Princeps,\r\nand he may have decided according to the weight of the names of those\r\nwho handed them in. Nero, we are told, took opinions on paper, and,\r\nafter reading them, gave his own judgment as though it were that of the\r\nmajority of his advisers.[2064] Under Severus Alexander opinions were\r\ngiven verbally and taken down in short-hand.[2065]\r\n\r\nWe have already shown that it is probable that the imperial _consilium_\r\nin its developed form was employed by the praefect of the praetorian\r\nguard when he gave judgment _vice_ the Princeps.[2066]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nITALY AND THE PROVINCES UNDER THE PRINCIPATE\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. _The Organisation of Italy_\r\n\r\nThe chief feature of the organisation of Italy during the early\r\nPrincipate was the completion of the efforts made during the later\r\nRepublic at incorporating its towns with Rome. The unity aimed at was\r\nchiefly that of jurisdiction, but we have no evidence of the steps\r\nwhich Augustus took to perfect the system of judicial centralisation,\r\nwhich had been devised at the close of the Republic.[2067] At the same\r\ntime this Emperor adopted a device which, though its full details and\r\neffects are unknown, seemed to foreshadow the later principle of a close\r\nadministrative unification of Italy with the capital. He divided the\r\npeninsula, exclusive of the immediate territory of Rome, into eleven\r\nregions (_regiones_).[2068] The immediate purpose contemplated by this\r\ndivision is unknown; but it laid the basis for subsequent distributions\r\nof many branches of Italian administration. The public domains, taxes\r\npaid by Roman citizens such as the _vicesima hereditatum_, and the\r\nresults of the census, were organised or calculated by regions.[2069]\r\nThey were employed, therefore, for work which necessarily fell on the\r\ncentral government, and this organisation so far implied no infringement\r\non the communal autonomy of the towns. Such infringement came as a\r\nnecessary result of the influence of the personality of the Princeps,\r\nwhich finally dominated Italy as effectually as it controlled Rome. But\r\nits coming was very gradual· The final change may be illustrated by\r\nthe disappearance of the municipal _comitia_, the limitation of local\r\njurisdiction, the loss of an independent system of local finance, and\r\nthe control ultimately assumed by the central government of the actual\r\nadministration of many of the Italian states.\r\n\r\nOf these changes, the downfall of the _comitia_ is perhaps less\r\nremarkable than their continuance for so long a period after the\r\nassemblies had ceased to be a reality at Rome. A Latin colony in the time\r\nof Domitian still elects its magistrates at a _comitia curiata_,[2070]\r\nand the transference of this principle to Spain shows its prevalence at\r\nthe time in Italy. The paucity of inscriptions of the early Principate\r\nwhich speak of elections by the only alternative body, the local Senate,\r\nis remarkable, and there are clear indications of the survival of the\r\nprinciple of popular election until the time of Antoninus Pius.[2071] It\r\ndoubtless retained its hold on Italy as late as it did on the western\r\nprovinces; its disappearance from the whole municipal sphere was the\r\nresult of a new system of creating magistrates, the characteristics of\r\nwhich will be traced when we are dealing with the provinces of this\r\nperiod.[2072] The elective power of the assemblies no doubt survived all\r\ntheir administrative functions. The tendency even of the early Principate\r\nwas to confine these to the local Senates, which were accounted more\r\nresponsible bodies, and were far better instruments of the central\r\ncontrolling power of Rome.\r\n\r\nThe limitation of the local courts of law cannot be fully illustrated,\r\nbut it is to some extent connected with the establishment of high\r\nindividual authorities for jurisdiction in Italy, which begins with\r\nHadrian. That Emperor divided Italy into four great circuits, and placed\r\neach of them under a _consularis_.[2073] These magistrates were replaced\r\nunder Marcus Aurelius by _juridici_[2074] of praetorian rank, whose\r\npurely civil jurisdiction was finally concerned with that portion of\r\nItaly which was separated from the _urbica dioecesis_, the sphere of\r\nthe praetor’s competence.[2075] These officials are mentioned only in\r\nconnexion with extraordinary jurisdiction concerned with trusts, the\r\nnomination of guardians,[2076] or questions of administrative law, such\r\nas a controversy concerning the qualification for the decurionate.[2077]\r\nBut, as extraordinary jurisdiction was gaining the upper hand of the _jus\r\nordinarium_, and as such administrative questions would at an earlier\r\nperiod have been settled by the municipalities themselves,[2078] the\r\npowers of the _juridici_ may be regarded as a very real limitation of\r\nthose of the local magistrates and senates. We have already seen that\r\nall the higher criminal jurisdiction of these towns had disappeared.\r\nWithin the limit of a hundred miles from Rome such cognisance belonged\r\nto the praefect of the city, outside this limit to the praefect of the\r\nguard.[2079]\r\n\r\nThe financial difficulties under which many of the Italian towns\r\nlaboured, invited a further system of imperial control. This took the\r\nform of the institution of _curatores rei publicae_, of senatorial or\r\nequestrian rank, whose existence is traceable from the close of the\r\nfirst century A.D., and who were given by the Princeps as extraordinary\r\ncommissioners to reinvigorate the financial life of poverty-stricken\r\nmunicipalities.[2080]\r\n\r\nBut an even more vigorous control was impending, which was to bring Italy\r\nnearer to the condition of a province. The extraordinary commissioners\r\nknown as _correctores_ (διορθωταί), whom the Principate often gave to\r\nfree cities or districts in the provinces,[2081] were finally transferred\r\nto Italy.[2082] When its municipalities were placed under this tutelage,\r\nthere was little more than a formal difference between their condition\r\nand that of the subject towns, and nothing but a more regular system\r\nof administration and the imposition of direct taxation was wanted to\r\nchange Italy into a province. Both these changes were effected under\r\nthe rule of Diocletian. Italy was, it is true, not divided into\r\n_provinciae_, but its districts were placed under regularly-appointed\r\n_correctores_, and its lands supplied revenues to the imperial court\r\nand to Rome. This climax of centralisation was probably the inevitable\r\nresult of the imperial system and the external circumstances of the\r\ntime. To the Princeps Italian and provincial problems were the same;\r\nItaly was not always the country in which the Emperor established his\r\npermanent residence, and, as the onset of the barbarians threatened even\r\nthe Italian frontier, there was no possible reason why Italy should\r\nnot pay its quota to the general taxation. But economic and social\r\nevils may have contributed to the imperial encroachments on Italian\r\nadministration. The weaknesses which led to imperial control may have\r\nbeen those which the Emperors sought to cure. These were poverty and\r\ndepopulation, and how earnestly they were grappled with may be seen by\r\na glance at the system of state support known as the _alimentarium_.\r\nThe leading idea of this institution is the endowment of a state or\r\ndistrict with a fund which should give partial support to children, and\r\nby this means encourage production and relieve the responsibilities of\r\nparents or guardians. Such charitable efforts had, at an early period,\r\nbeen made by individuals;[2083] and from the reign of Nerva the state,\r\nas represented by the Princeps, took up the enterprise. Nerva’s example\r\nwas followed by Trajan,[2084] who extended and organised the system, and\r\nsimilar efforts were made by Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, Marcus Aurelius,\r\nand Severus Alexander.[2085] The form usually taken by the endowment was\r\nan advance by the Princeps of funds which were deposited on good landed\r\nsecurity at moderate interest, 5 or 2½ per cent. From this interest a\r\ncertain number of boys and girls were to be supported, by the gift either\r\nof a certain amount of corn or of a sum of money—twelve, sixteen, or\r\ntwenty sesterces—per month. This support was guaranteed until the boys\r\nhad attained their eighteenth and the girls their fourteenth year.[2086]\r\nThe details of this organisation were supervised in each locality by a\r\n_quaestor alimentorum_, while the general control of the funds over a\r\nlarge district was usually entrusted to the curators of the roads[2087]\r\nwhich ran through that domain, who sometimes bore the title _praefectus_,\r\nsometimes that of _curator alimentorum_.[2088] This wise method of\r\ncharitable relief, which inspired an interest in agriculture while it\r\nrelieved poverty and encouraged the growth of population, continued\r\nin force until the close of the Principate, and the _praefecti_,\r\nwho administered this department, can be traced till the time of\r\nDiocletian.[2089]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. _The Organisation of the Provinces_\r\n\r\nThe imperial problem of the later Republic—the task of finding a\r\nfrontier—occupied the unceasing energy of the early Principes, and in\r\nthis, as in similar cases in the history of the world, delimitation\r\ninvolved extension. Sometimes the views as to the proper boundary\r\naltered, and advance was at times succeeded by retrogression. Thus\r\nAugustus sought the Elbe only to fall back on the Rhine, and Trajan\r\nadopted against the great eastern power a heroic policy of annexation\r\nwhich did not commend itself to his successor. In one instance, too—that\r\nof Britain—a forward movement was made which can scarcely be explained\r\nas the search for a scientific frontier. But, on the whole, the slow and\r\nordered progress was one that sought not territories, but boundaries,\r\nand the movement necessitated expansion, whether it took the form of\r\nthe annexation of the wild districts to the south of the Danube, or the\r\ngradual absorption of the kingdoms and principalities which intervened\r\nbetween the old Asiatic provinces and the Euphrates or the African\r\ndominions and the sea. The Danube, the Rhine, and the German Ocean; the\r\nEuphrates and the Syrian Desert; the Ethiopian kingdoms, the Sahara, and\r\nthe Atlantic, were the limits within which the Principate was to strive\r\nto make the best of the means left by the victorious Republic for the\r\ngovernment of the world. The Republic had indeed laid a solid foundation\r\nfor ordered rule, and although we are accustomed to think of the Roman\r\nEmpire chiefly in connexion with the three peaceful centuries of the\r\nPrincipate, it should not be forgotten that the work of the latter was\r\nchiefly the introduction, not of original ideas, but of those slight but\r\ndecisive modifications which are sufficient to change a clumsy into a\r\nworkable machine. A more effective, although far from perfect, system of\r\nmilitary defence, a greater division of authority amongst the organs of\r\ngovernment, a more careful estimate of provincial burdens, a competent\r\nalthough perhaps over-rigid civil service,—these were the immediate gifts\r\nof the Principate to the world. The results were comfort and peace; but\r\na comfort that was too often divested of even local patriotism, and a\r\npeace that was singularly devoid of intellectual ideals. A universal\r\ncitizenship was also amongst the hidden treasures of the Empire, but it\r\nwas a gift conferred in proportion to its valuelessness, and the Princeps\r\nwhose edict was to make the world a city was a calculating spendthrift\r\nbent only on increasing the taxes of his subjects. But, since the golden\r\nmean of Empire had yet to be found, we cannot blame the Principate for\r\ndoing too much that which the Republic did too little. Every reaction is\r\nviolent, and in this instance at least over-government was intended to\r\nbe in the interest of the subject. The subject acclaimed it, at least in\r\nits initial stages,[2090] although his descendant was to find it a burden\r\nin comparison with which the yoke of the Republican proconsul would have\r\nseemed a trifle.\r\n\r\nAugustus with characteristic modesty and discretion reserved his strength\r\nfor the most difficult of the provinces—those on the frontier which\r\ndemanded military occupation and unusual vigilance in administration—and\r\nthus created the distinction between Caesar’s provinces and those which\r\nwere public (_publicae_) and were entrusted to the care of the Senate and\r\npeople.[2091] There were occasional interchanges of provinces between the\r\nco-rulers. Thus Achaea and Macedonia were relinquished by the Senate\r\nin A.D. 15, but restored to it in A.D. 44,[2092] and Marcus Aurelius\r\ntook over or surrendered districts according to the necessities of\r\nwar.[2093] But in the middle of the Principate the Senate possessed but\r\neleven,[2094] the Princeps twenty-one under regular governors,[2095] nine\r\nadministered by procurators,[2096] one, Egypt, ruled by an equestrian\r\npraefect.\r\n\r\nAs in the Republic, the only true provincial _civitates_ were those\r\nwhich were _stipendiariae_. The free or free and allied communities\r\nwere still technically exempt from the governor’s control. But the\r\nfree cities were lessened in number and restricted in privileges. The\r\nsupposed abuse of its self-governing powers by a _foederata civitas_\r\nmight cause the treaty to be rescinded and the state to be brought under\r\ndirect provincial rule;[2097] while, even when _libertas_ was retained,\r\nits merits might be suspected, and the state might be placed under the\r\nfinancial tutelage of _curatores_ (λογισταί) or the administrative care\r\nof _correctores_ (διορθωταί) appointed by the Princeps.[2098] It is also\r\ncertain that _libertas_ no longer conferred immunity from taxation. We\r\nknow that, of the cities of Asia which are described as tributary in the\r\nreign of Tiberius,[2099] two, Magnesia ad Sipylum and Apollonidea, were\r\n_liberae_,[2100] while Byzantium, which had been in alliance with Rome\r\nduring the Republic, also paid tribute in the reign of Claudius.[2101]\r\nThis change, which is specially noticeable in the East, has been with\r\ngreat probability attributed to Pompeius. While granting or renewing\r\ncharters and privileges, he reserved to Rome the right to tax,[2102]\r\nand thus dissociated the ideas of _libertas_ and _immunitas_, which had\r\nhitherto been inseparable. The new principle was so fully accepted by\r\nthe Principate that even the possession of Latin rights could not have\r\nexempted a state from taxation,[2103] and the immunity of cities became\r\nmore of an exceptional political privilege. Sometimes it took the form of\r\nexemption only from a special tax, such as the freedom from the port dues\r\nof Illyricum claimed by the state Tyras in Moesia.[2104] Less frequently\r\nit was a freedom from all external burdens, such as that enjoyed, on\r\naccount of its historical associations, by the town of Ilium.[2105]\r\nBut the favourite means of granting immunity to a state was to confer\r\nthe right known as the _jus Italicum_—a right which implied that the\r\nmembers of the city were, like the inhabitants of Italy, in quiritarian\r\nownership of their soil, and, therefore, exempt from the land-tax. This\r\nright generally accompanied the honorary designation of the town as a\r\n_colonia_, although the title might be conferred without the right,[2106]\r\nor be accompanied by only a partial immunity.[2107] Many states in\r\nLusitania, Gaul, Germany, Syria, and Phoenicia were made _coloniae_ and\r\ngranted the _jus Italicum_.[2108]\r\n\r\nThe two great problems in taxation which confronted the early Principate\r\nwere the formation of an estimate of the resources of the Empire, and\r\nthe apportionment of burdens by reference to the capacities of the\r\nvarious countries. Both tasks were undertaken vigorously by Augustus.\r\nTo both belong his budget of the resources of the Empire,[2109] the\r\ngeographical works undertaken under the auspices of Agrippa,[2110] and\r\nthe comprehensive assessments made in various provinces. The right of\r\nmaking such assessments belonged to the Princeps,[2111] and seems not\r\nto have been limited to his own provinces, although it is to these that\r\nour definite information chiefly refers. The first known census of the\r\nkind was that undertaken in the three Gauls in 27 B.C.,[2112] which we\r\nfind renewed in the years 14, 17, and 61 A.D.[2113] There is a trace of\r\nan Augustan census in Spain,[2114] and a similar task was undertaken in\r\nSyria.[2115] When these great preliminary estimates were over, provision\r\nhad to be made for a periodical revision of the assessment. This was\r\ndone under imperial control and for each province separately. A special\r\nimperial decree was issued, and under it the commissioner (_censor_,\r\n_censitor_, _ad census accipiendos_)[2116] made a renewed estimate, with\r\nthe assistance of delegates, in the shape of equestrian officers and\r\nprocurators, for the special communities or districts in the provinces\r\nsubject to the census. Originally the chief officials were of senatorial\r\nrank, but after the end of the second century equestrian procurators\r\nwere generally entrusted with the census[2117]—a circumstance which is\r\nprobably to be accounted for by the fact that in the course of years the\r\nduty of making out the returns had become more automatic and therefore\r\nsimpler.[2118] It is not known whether there were fixed dates for the\r\nregular recurrence of the census in each province;[2119] but there were\r\ntaxes, such as the _tributum capitis_ in Syria, paid only by people of an\r\nage that fitted them for labour,[2120] which would have demanded renewed\r\nregistration at somewhat short intervals; and in Egypt there was a cycle\r\nof fourteen years for the payment at least of the poll-tax, which goes\r\nback to the time of Tiberius and perhaps of Augustus.[2121] The careful\r\nnature of the estimate of the land-tax is shown by the official form of\r\nthe schedule of returns (_forma censualis_), which has been preserved.\r\nThis specified the community and _pagus_ in which the farm was situated,\r\nthe names of two neighbours, and the character of the land assessed.[2122]\r\n\r\nThe taxes were either imposts on the land (_tributum soli_) or on the\r\nperson (_tributum capitis_). The land-tax was in most provinces paid\r\neither in money or grain, more usually in the former; but in certain\r\nminor districts it was delivered wholly, or almost wholly, in kind.\r\nCyrene sent its famous silphium, the Sanni in Pontus wax, and the Frisii\r\nof Germany the skins of oxen.[2123] The personal tax might be one on\r\nprofessions, income, or movable property. It was rarely a poll-tax pure\r\nand simple, although this is found in Egypt[2124] as a relic of the\r\nPtolemaic organisation; amongst the Jews, when the δίδραχμον had been\r\ndiverted from the Jewish temple to that of Jupiter Capitolinus;[2125]\r\nin Britain,[2126] where it would have been difficult to collect any\r\nother personal tax from the mass of the people; and in the tiny island\r\nof Tenos,[2127] whose poverty probably forbade any other method of\r\nassessment. It may, however, have existed in many provinces by the side\r\nof other personal taxes as a burden imposed on those whose property fell\r\nbelow a certain rating.\r\n\r\nThe collection of the chief imperial taxes was now direct, since the\r\nsystem of _decumae_ with the accompanying tax-farmers (_decumani_) had\r\nbeen abolished.[2128] But there seem to have been different degrees of\r\ndirectness in the method. A distinction is drawn between the _stipendium_\r\nof the public and the _tributum_ of Caesar’s provinces,[2129] and as this\r\ndistinction can scarcely be one of a method of taxation, it must be one\r\nbased on the method of collection. Perhaps in the public provinces the\r\ntaxes were still collected by the states themselves and paid by them to\r\nthe quaestor, while in the imperial provinces the procurator came into\r\ndirect contact with the tax-payer. But much was still left to the efforts\r\nof private companies, and the abolition of the _decumani_ was perhaps the\r\nsole infringement made on the vast operations of the _publicani_. The\r\nextent to which the system of contracting out was still employed may be\r\nillustrated by the facts that “companies of Roman knights” are said still\r\nto have gathered in the _pecuniae vectigales_—by which the _portoria_\r\nare chiefly meant—and other _publici fructus_—the revenues from mines,\r\nsalt-works, quarries, and the like—during the reign of Tiberius,[2130]\r\nthat in the reign of Nero severe measures had to be taken to repress the\r\nexactions of the _publicani_,[2131] and that these state middlemen have\r\na title devoted to them in the _Digest_ of Justinian.[2132] Even a tax\r\nwhich fell to an imperial treasury, such as the _vicesima hereditatum_,\r\nwas collected by contractors in the reign of Trajan.[2133] The contracts\r\nwere no longer leased by a central authority in Rome, but by the official\r\nwho controlled the department with which the tax was concerned. In most\r\ncases it was an imperial procurator who leased the tax, and perhaps\r\nto some extent supervised its collection.[2134] The direct taxes were\r\npaid to the quaestor in the public provinces, and in the imperial were\r\ncollected by the procurators, of whose functions and operations we have\r\nalready spoken.[2135] In connexion with the fiscus of each province there\r\nwas a bureau (_tabularium_)[2136] in which the assessments were kept.\r\n\r\nThe method of government in the public provinces underwent considerable\r\nmodifications, but suffered little formal alteration. The tenure\r\nof office was still annual, and the regulation that a five years’\r\ninterval must elapse between home and foreign command,[2137] which had\r\nbeen neglected by Caesar,[2138] was revived by Augustus,[2139] but\r\nconsiderations of fitness and another method of determining seniority\r\nconsiderably interfered with the application of the latter principle.\r\nSome qualified candidates were set aside by the Senate either on its own\r\nmotion or by the advice of the Emperor,[2140] and the _jus liberorum_\r\nadmitted some to the _sortitio_ in preference to others.[2141] All the\r\ngovernors of public provinces were now called proconsuls, whether they\r\nhad previously held the consulship or not,[2142] in order to distinguish\r\nthem from the legates of Caesar’s provinces, who all bore the title _pro\r\npraetore_. The two greatest of the public provinces, Asia and Africa,\r\nwere always given to _consulares_, while the other governments might be\r\nheld by men of praetorian rank. A definite allowance (_salarium_) was\r\nnow given to the governor,[2143] which must have removed some of his\r\ntemptation to extortion. Each proconsul was attended by lictors and had\r\nthe other _insignia_ of his rank. But the _proconsulare imperium_ was in\r\nmany respects a mere shadow of its former self. Its possessor did not\r\nwear the sword or the military dress,[2144] to show that his command\r\nwas not a military one, and in deference to the full _proconsulare\r\nimperium_ possessed by the Princeps. It was an exception to this rule\r\nthat until the time of the Emperor Gaius the legion in Africa was under\r\nthe command of the governor of that province;[2145] but even here, where\r\nthe employment of active military power was needed, the appointment of\r\nthe proconsul was thrown practically on the Princeps.[2146] The governor\r\nwas also hampered by assessors[2147] more carefully selected than the\r\n_legati_ of Republican times. The _legati proconsulis pro praetore_,\r\nthree of whom were assigned to the higher class of provinces, such as\r\nAsia and Africa, and one to the lower, such as Sicily and Baetica,\r\nalthough nominally selected by the proconsuls themselves, had to be\r\napproved by the Princeps; and the fact that they bear a title which\r\nsuggests the _imperium_ shows, that although they were still delegates\r\nof the governor, their jurisdiction was more definite and independent\r\nin the dioceses assigned them than it had been in Republican times.\r\nEven the quaestor now bears the title _quaestor pro praetore_,[2148]\r\nand exercises, besides his financial functions, a definite judicial\r\ncharge—the kind of jurisdiction which was in the hands of the curule\r\naedile at Rome.[2149] We have already shown the possibilities of imperial\r\ninterference with the administration and jurisdiction of proconsular\r\ngovernors through the presence of procurators in their provinces, and\r\nthrough the tendencies which led to the Emperor’s becoming a court of\r\nappeal for the whole provincial world.[2150]\r\n\r\nIn his own provinces Caesar was the only possessor of the _proconsulate\r\nimperium_.[2151] Hence his governors were merely legates (_legati\r\nCaesaris pro praetore_). They were not, however, regarded as mere\r\ndelegates. They exercised an independent jurisdiction, which they\r\ncould delegate to their subordinates—a proceeding of which the mere\r\nmandatary is incapable.[2152] Their military command was delegated, but\r\nsome at least of them exercised the power of life and death over the\r\nsoldiers in their province.[2153] All the legates wore the military\r\ndress and sword,[2154] since all governed provinces in which legions\r\nwere quartered. But even their military discretion was to some extent\r\nlimited by the fact that the legions now had their own regular commanders\r\n(_legati legionum_), while their civil authority was lessened by the\r\ncircumstances that the financial affairs of the province were chiefly\r\nin the hands of a procurator responsible to the Princeps or to a\r\nbureau, and that in many provinces after the time of Hadrian and the\r\nAntonines we find a special legate appointed for jurisdiction (_legatus\r\njuridicus_),[2155] who, though inferior to the governor in rank, was a\r\ndelegate not of him but of the Princeps.\r\n\r\nOne of the secrets of the better administration of Caesar’s provinces\r\nwas the length of time during which one of these legates might be kept\r\nin a single province. Thus in Tiberius’ reign Sabinus governed Moesia\r\nfor twenty and Silius Gaul for seven years,[2156] while somewhat later\r\nGalba was in Spain for eight.[2157] In every case the tenure of such\r\ncommands depended on the Emperor’s discretion,[2158] and the holders drew\r\nfixed salaries from the imperial treasury.[2159] To the higher class of\r\nprovinces, such as Syria, _consulares_ were sent; those of a lower class,\r\nsuch as Aquitania and Galatia, might be governed by men of praetorian\r\nrank.\r\n\r\nThe sphere of imperial rule included a class of dependencies which\r\nhad not yet become, or were not thought worthy of being, organised\r\nas definite provinces and placed under senatorial legates. They were\r\ngoverned by personal agents of Caesar, who were in this case known as\r\n_procuratores Caesaris pro legato_.[2160] Some of these districts, such\r\nas the three Alpine provinces, were comparatively small: but others, such\r\nas the Mauretanias, Thrace, Judaea,[2161] were of considerable size, and\r\nthe presence of mere procurators in such countries must be accounted\r\nfor by the fact that they were not important military stations but\r\ndefended by some great command in a neighbouring province. The procurator\r\nwas, indeed, sometimes under the partial control of the neighbouring\r\nimperial legate; thus Judaea was in some way attached to the larger\r\nprovince of Syria, and Pilate was deposed from office by Vitellius its\r\ngovernor.[2162] But even in this case the procurator is the delegate,\r\nnot of the governor, but of the Princeps. Thus, when St. Paul appealed\r\nagainst the jurisdiction of Festus, the appeal was made directly to\r\nCaesar.\r\n\r\nAnomalous methods of government were adopted for the two greatest\r\nmilitary and strategic positions in the Empire—Germany, which was divided\r\ninto an upper and a lower province, and Egypt. The two strips of land\r\nwest of the Rhine, which contained the garrisons not merely of the river\r\nfrontier but of Gaul, were not placed under the ordinary provincial\r\nlegates. The two consular _legati_, not of the separate legions, but of\r\nthe armies, were themselves the governors of the districts; they bore the\r\ntitle _pro praetore_,[2163] and, except when the supreme command over\r\nGaul and the Germanies was assumed by a colleague of the Emperor,[2164]\r\nwere not under the control of any governor of the neighbouring Gallic\r\nprovinces. Egypt, in a sense a private domain of the Princeps,[2165]\r\nand, as the key of land and sea, guarded even from the approach of a\r\nman of senatorial rank,[2166] was entrusted to an equestrian praefect\r\n(_praefectus Aegypti_), who exercised the reality without the name of the\r\n_imperium_,[2167] wielded all the powers of a governor,[2168] and had an\r\narmy under his control.\r\n\r\nThe Romanisation of the provinces was still effected by the insensible\r\nchannels which had been operative during the Republic—social intercourse,\r\ncommerce, and the forms of the provincial edict. But more conscious\r\nefforts in the same direction were made in the Western world. The\r\nfoundation of municipalities of an Italian type, the encouragement given\r\nto a Latin-speaking foreigner to find a career in the imperial service,\r\nthe state support given to Roman systems of education—all tended to make\r\nportions of provinces, such as Gaul and Spain, centres of as pure a\r\nLatinity as could be found in Italy itself. Even when the full _civitas_\r\nwas not at once conceded, preparation for it was made by the grant of\r\nLatin rights which were now conferred on whole provinces, such as Sicily,\r\nthe Maritime Alps, and Spain,[2169] and made the dwellers in these\r\nregions participants in all the private rights of Roman law. The general\r\ntendency was to elevate the West at the expense of the East, or rather\r\nperhaps to decline the struggle with Hellenic civilisation, and to rest\r\ncontent with Romanising the barbarism of the lands that encircled Italy.\r\nIn spite of this, the greatest triumphs of the legal genius were to be\r\nfound in the East; the gift for theory seemed to be still peculiarly a\r\nproperty of the Greek or Oriental mind, and it was Asia, Phoenicia, and\r\nSyria that produced the names of Gaius, Ulpian, and Papinian. Such men\r\nhad the signal advantage of comparing and even practising two perfected\r\nsystems; for until the beginning of the third century, Graeco-Oriental\r\nforms were the common law of the Eastern half of the Empire, and the\r\nedict of Caracalla, which by the grant of the _civitas_ implied the\r\nfuture currency of Roman forms, must have created something like a legal\r\nrevolution in this part of Rome’s dominions.[2170]\r\n\r\nThe omnipresence of Roman law was a fitting consequence and symbol of\r\nthe even, harmonious, uneventful working of provincial life, and of the\r\nuniform machinery which was eliminating national characteristics and\r\nreducing all provinces to the same level of excellence or decadence. But,\r\nin spite of the highly organised character of provincial administration,\r\nit was the city-state (_civitas_) that was still the unit, and the\r\ncharacter of its public life remained at all times the test of the\r\neffectiveness of the Roman system.\r\n\r\nAmidst the brilliant variety of the urban life of the Empire, some\r\nuniformity had been secured even during the days of the Republic by\r\nRome’s leaning to aristocratic types of organisation. But a slight\r\nmodification of existing forms of constitution was all that was\r\nneeded to bring the local machinery into harmony with that of the\r\ncentral government, and there was no effort made to create a uniform\r\ntype of administration or to regard the provincial state as a mere\r\nmunicipality adapted only to serve the purposes of the imperial system.\r\nThe Principate ushers in this latter tendency, but at first it is very\r\ngradual. In its initial stages it manifests itself in the light of a\r\npaternal interest, whether on the part of governors or Emperors, in\r\nthe affairs of local corporations, in minute regulations as to the\r\nresponsibilities of magistrates, the use of public funds, and the care of\r\npublic property.[2171] Perhaps for a time such measures were beneficial;\r\ncertainly for nearly two centuries, in spite of the fact that there is\r\nhere and there observable a tendency to shirk municipal office as a\r\nburden,[2172] the vitality of the towns, fostered by peace and the large\r\nrevenues of commerce, was strong enough to resist the enervating effects\r\nof this interference, and hundreds of inscriptions show us a wealth,\r\na splendour, a generosity in endowment, and a thirst for municipal\r\nfame, that seem a sufficient reward for the untiring exertions of an\r\nanxious government. But this government finally came to lean on what it\r\nhad fostered. The same tendencies, still very imperfectly understood,\r\nwhich changed professions into corporations, trades into guilds, and\r\nmade even military service a hereditary burden, fastened on the towns,\r\nand the government sought to find in them a class which would be solely\r\nresponsible for local and imperial duties. This was found ultimately\r\nin the local Senate—the order of _decuriones_ or _curiales_—which had\r\nalways formed the pivot of municipal administration controlled or\r\ncreated by Rome, but which now tended to become sharply severed from the\r\nother classes in the communities, and, while solely endowed with the\r\nprivileges of office, held these privileges at a tenure which it would\r\ngladly have surrendered. The legal texts of our period do not yet show\r\nthe crushed and broken aristocracy of a later date; but they reveal the\r\nbeginning of the movement which was to lead men to regard membership of\r\nthe Senate as certain ruin, and to flee from office as though it were\r\nthe plague. In the first place, the local magistracy was ceasing to be a\r\nstepping-stone to the Senate. There is a tendency to recruit the order\r\nthrough an _adlectio_ of otherwise unqualified members,[2173] a tendency\r\nwhich reveals an anxiety to preserve the maximum numbers of the order.\r\nThis admission is effected by the board itself, and prepares us for the\r\npractice of the later Empire by which the order recruits itself from all\r\nqualified persons who are bound to serve. In another way also the earlier\r\nrelation of magistrate to senate was being reversed. The principle of the\r\nearlier law, in accordance with which the previous possession of office\r\nis a necessary qualification for the _curia_,[2174] has been changed for\r\none in accordance with which none but a decurion can be a magistrate.\r\nA definite grade of municipal nobility has been evolved, an official\r\ncaste has been created, and the decurions are sharply severed from the\r\nPlebs.[2175]\r\n\r\nEach class has its burdens, and, though the severest of these were\r\nultimately to fall on the _curiales_, the municipal law of the _Digest_\r\ncalls on all members of the communes to do their duties to their\r\nstate and to the Empire. Each class has its appropriate duties; to\r\nthe decurions belong the higher branches of administration, but every\r\ncategory of citizens has its _munera congruentia_.[2176] The legal\r\nwriters divide the burdens of public life into two categories. The\r\n_munera personalia_ are those that demand the activity of the person;\r\nthe _munera patrimonii_ those that are incumbent on wealth.[2177] To the\r\nformer belong the functions of public officials such as those concerned\r\nwith the finances of the state, with the inspection of the market,\r\nroads, buildings and aqueducts, with the maintenance of the peace or the\r\nrepresentation of the interests of the city. But municipal duties by no\r\nmeans exhausted the category of such burdens. The state finally saddled\r\nthe municipalities with the returns for the census and the raising of\r\nthe revenue in corn or money, and made the collectors responsible for\r\nany deficit.[2178] The cost of the imperial transport and post had also\r\nbecome a municipal burden.[2179] These last obligations introduce us to\r\nthe idea of the patrimonial burdens, which existed wherever by law or\r\ncustom expense was incurred by the individual undertaking them. There\r\nwere few in which such expenditure was not incurred, and the policy of\r\nthe dying Principate was to lay heavy imposts on capital, which increased\r\nin proportion to the diminution in number of the wealthier classes. When\r\nexertion was met with this reward it tended to relax, and a decaying\r\nagriculture and an enfeebled commerce were the results of the oppression\r\nof the government. Whatever the primary cause of these evils was,\r\nwhether military, social, or economic, they were doubtless aggravated\r\nby the relentless system of imperial administration, which marshalled\r\ncitizens as though they were soldiers, treated all classes as the fitting\r\ninstruments of official life, and regarded the subject as existing for\r\nthe Empire rather than the Empire for the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. _The Worship of the Emperor_\r\n\r\nOne result of the discipline which we have described was doubtless to\r\ncreate a strong, though not a warm, imperial sentiment. A gentler bond of\r\nunion amongst the provinces and of attachment to the imperial house was\r\nto be found in the carefully cultivated world-religion which expressed\r\nitself in the form of Caesar-worship.\r\n\r\nThe cult of the Emperor, although stimulated and encouraged by the\r\nimperial government, was by no means a purely artificial product. Had\r\nit offended against Roman or Italian sentiment, it would have been\r\nstrangled in its birth; and had it met with no genuine response from the\r\nsubject nations, coercion[2180] and rewards would probably have given it\r\nmerely a precarious and transitory existence. The worship assumed two\r\nforms, neither of which was a strain on the religious beliefs of the\r\nage. In its application to the living Emperor, it was merely a reverence\r\npermitted to his spiritual personality, that _numen_ or _genius_, the\r\nabstract duplicate of man, the ever-present guardian-angel to whom, as\r\nrealised in the self, the Roman had often drunk or prayed. If to the\r\nmind of the barbarian the genius and the self were still more truly\r\none, the conception of the new worship was simpler but by no means less\r\nstrong. The reverence paid to the dead Caesar was a still more natural\r\neffort of grateful piety, not unwelcome to a cultured society which\r\naccepted Euhemeristic explanations of the gods, and indigenous at least\r\namongst the Greek-speaking and oriental portions of the Empire. In the\r\nprovinces, too, all the sordid aspects of imperial humanity were removed;\r\nto the provincial mind Caesar was a potent and unseen power, a distant\r\nincarnation of wisdom and order, a being whose sway was far wider than\r\nthat of any local god, whose ordinances penetrated to the ends of the\r\nearth, and in whose hands the safety and happiness of the human race\r\nwere set.[2181] The idealism which to-day makes of a king something more\r\nthan a man, had, in a less fastidious religious environment, made of\r\nthe Roman Emperor a god, and even in the more prosaic West, in countries\r\nsuch as Gaul or Spain or Britain, where Caesar-worship required a certain\r\namount of cultivation, we must suppose an undercurrent of genuine belief.\r\n\r\nThe first step taken in the inauguration of the new worship was a\r\nhappy one. It was a graceful act to honour a predecessor, who had\r\nbeen the ruler of the Roman world, and might be regarded as a martyr\r\nin its cause, and Octavian permitted the consecration of a temple to\r\n_divus Julius_,[2182] who was regarded, from a sentimental if not from\r\na legal point of view, as the founder of the new dynasty. His own\r\nworship the Emperor prohibited in Italy, and he declined an altar in\r\nthe _curia_.[2183] But in the year 20 B.C. a temple dedicated to him\r\nunder the name of Augustus rose at Panium in Palestine,[2184] and in\r\nthe next year the form of dedication to “Roma and Augustus,” which\r\nassociated his _numen_ with that of the city, and whose modesty secured\r\nhis consent,[2185] began to spread through the provinces. A temple with\r\nthis rite sprang up at Pergamum,[2186] and in 12 B.C. a similar worship,\r\nwhich replaced that of the native sun-god Lug, was established for the\r\nGallic nobles at Lugdunum.[2187] An attempt was also made to consolidate\r\nthe infant organisation of the new province of Germany by establishing\r\nan altar at the Oppidum Ubiorum (Köln) as the centre of its religious\r\nlife.[2188] Rome itself could not wholly be deprived of a cult that\r\nwas becoming universal, and in 8 B.C. a recognition of the divinity of\r\nAugustus was permitted in the only form which he would allow during his\r\nlifetime. His _genius_ was associated with the household gods or _Lares_\r\nin the worship of the _vici_ of the capital.[2189] The movement spread\r\nthrough Italy. The old _magistri vicorum_ become the _magistri Larum_,\r\nand soon gain the title _magistri Augustales_. They are found in every\r\npart of Italy, and beyond it in Sardinia, Narbonensis, Spain, Dacia,\r\nand even Egypt.[2190] On the death of the first Princeps his complete\r\ndeification was accorded by the Senate,[2191] and the recognition was\r\nfollowed by the permission to erect temples in the provinces,[2192]\r\nwhile private as well as public initiative fostered the cult of _divus\r\nAugustus_. The precedent set in the cases of the first two emperors\r\nhad firmly established the practice of posthumous deification, and its\r\ndenial to a Princeps was almost equivalent to the condemnation of his\r\nreign.[2193] Although the merits of Claudius as a divinity might be\r\nquestioned, and Vespasian, with sceptical tolerance, regarded his own\r\ndeification as an inevitable consequence of his position,[2194] yet by\r\nthe close of the second century the virtues of the Antonines had made the\r\nworship of the deified Emperor a more genuine cult than ever, and a man\r\nwas regarded as impious who had not some image of Marcus Aurelius in his\r\nhouse.[2195] This worship of the Caesars had two lasting effects on the\r\nsocial and political life of the Roman, Italian, and provincial worlds.\r\n\r\n(1) It established a priestly aristocracy. On the death and deification\r\nof Augustus a college of _Sodales Augustales_ was created for Rome,\r\nconsisting of twenty-one nobles, and containing in its list members of\r\nthe imperial house.[2196] _Flamines Augustales_ held the same dignified\r\nposition in their provinces or in their native towns, and were drawn\r\nfrom the aristocracies of the states. The _Flamen_ of the worship of\r\nRoma and Augustus, that had its centre at Narbo, wore the _praetexta_,\r\nwas attended by a lictor, had a front seat at games, and the right of\r\ntaking part in the deliberations of the local Senate. His wife, the\r\n_Flaminica_, was clothed on festal days in white or purple, and, like the\r\n_Flaminica Dialis_ at Rome, might not be compelled to take an oath.[2197]\r\nThe lower and middle classes were not forgotten in the distribution of\r\nthese religious honours. From the _magistri Augustales_, whom we have\r\nalready mentioned, developed an _ordo Augustalium_, which existed before\r\nthe death of Augustus both in Italy and the provinces, and the cult\r\nwith which it was associated was partly of spontaneous origin, partly\r\ncultivated by the imperial government, and may in some cases have been\r\nfounded by the municipal towns themselves. The _Augustales_ were not\r\npriests, like the _Flamines_ and _Sacerdotes_, but merely an order with\r\ncertain _insignia_—the _praetexta_, the _fasces_, the _tribunal_—which\r\nthey displayed in the performance of their official duties, and they have\r\nbeen compared to magistrates without secular magisterial functions.[2198]\r\nThe form which the organisation assumed was the appointment of _sexviri_\r\nor _seviri_, probably by the senate of the municipal town; after the year\r\nof service they pass into the order of _Augustales_.[2199] The order was\r\ncomposed mainly of freedmen—of a class, that is, whose birth excluded\r\nthem from the public offices of their states, but who, forming as they\r\ndid a large portion of the trading population, contributed, perhaps more\r\nthan any other, to the economic vitality of the towns. The worship of\r\nAugustus, by giving them _insignia_ and certain proud moments in which\r\nthey appeared to dazzling effect before the public eye, compensated to\r\nsome extent for the loss of privileges which the law withheld.\r\n\r\n(2) Caesar-worship was the only force that gave a kind of representative\r\nlife to the provinces. Great provincial diets (_concilia_, _communia_,\r\nκοινά) made their appearance both in the Eastern and Western world. Asia\r\nhad already dedicated temples to kings, proconsuls, and to the city of\r\nRome;[2200] and in the Hellenic world the national assemblies which\r\nsurvived the Roman conquest may have suggested, or may even at times\r\nhave been continued in, these new amphictyonic gatherings. The favour\r\nshown by the imperial government to this proof of loyalty soon led the\r\nWest to follow the example of the East, and the establishment of the\r\nworship of Roma and Augustus at Lugdunum, by creating a _concilium_ for\r\nthe three Gauls, was the prototype of a similar organisation in other\r\nEuropean provinces. Eventually every province of the Empire seems to\r\nhave evolved a diet of some kind, and even Britain, the least organised\r\nof Roman dependencies, possessed at Colchester a temple to the deified\r\nClaudius.[2201] The high-priests of the cult (_sacerdotes provinciae_,\r\nἀρχιερεῖς) were chosen annually from the most distinguished families,\r\nand delegates (_legati_, σύνεδροι) from the various districts or states,\r\nwhich made up the province, were despatched to the yearly meetings\r\n(_concilia_, κοινά). These delegates elected the high-priests and voted\r\nthe sums required for the purposes of the cult. But they felt themselves\r\nto be representatives of the province; they voiced its nationality and\r\nrepresented its collective interests as no other power did, and it would\r\nhave been impossible except by force to limit their utterances to purely\r\nreligious questions. This compulsion the government did not attempt. It\r\npermitted, perhaps encouraged, these delegates to make representations\r\nabout the condition of the province,[2202] and even to utter complaints\r\nabout the conduct of Roman officials.[2203] It is a pity that the\r\nimperial government did not do even more to preserve the fast-waning\r\nsense of nationality; but the value of what it did is proved by the\r\nfact that these assemblies and the dignified orders which they created\r\nsurvived into the Christian Empire. Titles such as Asiarch, Syriarch,\r\nPhoenicarch, derived from the high-priesthood of Caesar’s cult, were\r\nrespected by Constantine’s legislation,[2204] and survived like ghosts of\r\nthe pagan past to haunt for a time the life of a new œcumenical church\r\nwhich, through a fuller faith and a higher allegiance, had effected its\r\ntriumph over the old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\nTHE TWO ASSEMBLIES OF THE TRIBES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe existence of a _comitia tributa populi_, as distinct from the\r\n_concilium plebis tributim_, was first demonstrated by Mommsen (_Römische\r\nForschungen, Die patricisch-plebejischen Tributcomitien der Republik_).\r\nThe chief lines of evidence on which the proof of the existence of this\r\nparliament rests are as follows:—\r\n\r\n(i.) We have a series of passages which prove the continued distinction\r\nof the Populus and the Plebs and of patrician and plebeian magistrates,\r\nand which show that these magistrates could only summon the bodies of\r\nwhich they were respectively the representatives. These passages are:—\r\n\r\nFestus p. 293 “Scita plebei appellantur ea, quae plebs suo suffragio sine\r\npatribus jussit, plebeio magistratu rogante.”\r\n\r\nib. p. 330 “Scitum populi (est, quod eum magistra)tus patricius (rogavit\r\npopulusque suis suf)fragis jussit.... Plebes autem est (populus\r\nuniversus) praeter patricios.”\r\n\r\nib. p. 233 “cum plebes sine patri(bus a suo magistratu rogatur) quod\r\nplebes scivit, plebi(scitum est: plebs enim cum) appellatur, patrum\r\ncom(munio excluditur).”\r\n\r\n(ii.) There are abundant evidences of the early existence of a _comitia_\r\nof the tribes:—\r\n\r\n(_a_) The law of the Twelve Tables (451 B.C.) ordained, with respect\r\nto jurisdiction, “de capite civis nisi per maximum comitiatum ... ne\r\nferunto” (Cic. _de Leg._ iii. 4, 11). The mention of the “greatest\r\n_comitia_” clearly implies the existence of a lesser one with judicial\r\npowers; and as this is not likely to have been the _comitia curiata_ of\r\nthe period, it can hardly be any other assembly than the _comitia_ of the\r\ntribes.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The quaestors were first elected by the people in 447 B.C. (Tac.\r\n_Ann._ xi 22), and in later times their appointment was made by a\r\n_comitia_ of the tribes (Cic. _ad Fam._ vii 30).\r\n\r\n(_c_) The first legislative act of the people gathered _tributim_ is\r\nattributed to the year 357 B.C. (Liv. vii. 16 (consul) “legem novo\r\nexemplo ad Sutrium in castris tributim de vicensima eorum, qui manu\r\nmitterentur, tulit”).\r\n\r\nThe _comitia tributa populi_ was probably created between 471 B.C., the\r\ndate at which the Plebs began to meet _tributim_, and 451, the date at\r\nwhich the existence of such an assembly is hinted at in the Twelve Tables.\r\n\r\n(iii.) In the developed Republic we find an assembly meeting by tribes—\r\n\r\n(_a_) which is presided over by magistrates of the people, e.g. by the\r\nconsuls Manlius (Liv. vii. 16) and T. Quinctius Crispinus (Frontinus _de\r\nAquaed._ 129), by the dictator Caesar (Cic. _ad Fam._ vii. 30), and by P.\r\nClodius as curule aedile (Cic. _pro Sest._ 44, 95; _ad Q. fr._ 2, 3);\r\n\r\n(_b_) which elects magistrates of the people, e.g. the quaestors (Cic.\r\n_ad Fam._ vii. 30 “comitiis quaestoriis institutis ... ille (Caesar) ...\r\nqui comitiis tributis esset auspicatus”) and the curule aediles (Gell.\r\nvii. 9 “[Cn. Flavium] pro tribu aedilem curulem renuntiaverunt”);\r\n\r\n(_c_) which legislates. This legislative power is shown by the _lex\r\nQuinctia de aquaeductibus_ of 9 B.C. (Frontinus _de Aquaed._ 129);\r\n\r\n(_d_) and exercises judicial power. This judicial power is shown in the\r\ntrial of Milo for _vis_ in 56 B.C. (Cic. _pro Sest._ 44, 95; _ad Q. fr._\r\n2, 3). The prosecutor was a curule aedile, and the trial took place in\r\nthe Forum (“ejectus de rostris Clodius,” l.c. § 2).\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most striking demonstration of the existence of this assembly\r\nis contained in the prescription to the _lex Quinctia de aquaeductibus_\r\n(Frontinus l.c.), which runs as follows:—\r\n\r\n“T. Quinctius Crispinus consul populum jure rogavit populusque jure\r\nscivit in foro pro rostris aedis divi Julii pr(idie) [k.] Julias. Tribus\r\nSergia principium fuit, pro tribu Sex.... L. f. Virro [primus scivit].”\r\n\r\nHere we find an assembly of the Populus, presided over by a magistrate of\r\nthe people, meeting in the Forum and voting by tribes. It can, therefore,\r\nbe none other than a _comitia tributa populi_.\r\n\r\nAlthough the formal difference between this assembly and the _concilium\r\nplebis tributim_ was great—the one being summoned by magistrates of the\r\npeople, the other by plebeian magistrates; the one electing to popular,\r\nthe other to plebeian offices; the one passing _leges_, the other\r\n_plebiscita_—the material difference between the two bodies was small.\r\nThis consisted in the exclusion of Patricians from plebeian gatherings.\r\nWhen the consul or praetor summoned the tribes, the members of the few\r\npatrician families could attend; when the tribune summoned the tribes,\r\nthese members were bound to keep away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II\r\n\r\nA LIMITATION OF THE TRIBUNATE IN THE REIGN OF NERO\r\n\r\n\r\nTacitus in the _Annals_ (xiii. 28, 2), in describing certain limitations\r\non the powers of tribunes and aediles which were introduced in the year\r\n56 A.D., mentions one respecting the tribunate, the nature of which has\r\nnever yet been explained. He expresses it in the words “prohibiti tribuni\r\njus praetorum et consulum praeripere, aut vocare ex Italia cum quibus\r\nlege agi posset”—“the tribunes were forbidden to usurp the authority of\r\npraetors and consuls, or to summon out of Italy persons liable to legal\r\nproceedings.” It seems generally to be agreed that the _aut_ here is\r\nconjunctive, not disjunctive, i.e. that there is the closest connexion\r\nbetween “jus praetorum et consulum praeripere” and “vocare ex Italia,”\r\nand it seems that this must be the case; for Tacitus, vague as his\r\nreferences are in this chapter, could never have referred to anything so\r\nindeterminate as a “usurpation of the authority of praetors and consuls,”\r\nwithout some specification of the sphere or extent of this usurpation.\r\nI shall, therefore, assume that the second clause is explanatory of\r\nthe first, and that the “summons from Italy” in some way defines the\r\n“usurpation”—although, as will be seen, this assumption is by no means\r\nnecessary to my main argument, which will centre round the expression\r\n“vocare ex Italia.”\r\n\r\nThe remarks of commentators on this passage have been for the most part\r\nconfined to expressions of bewilderment at the constitutional anomalies\r\nit displays. They make the inevitable comment that the tribune had\r\nproperly no right of _vocatio_, although he sometimes exercised it (Varro\r\nap. Gell. xiii. 12), and that, if even he possessed this right, it ought\r\nnot to have been exercised outside the city walls. The only positive fact\r\nto be elicited from such statements is that the _vocatio_ here referred\r\nto is some kind of personal summons; who is summoned or for what purpose\r\nare questions which they seem to regard as incapable of an answer. The\r\nopinion of an eminent writer on Roman Law, who attempts to push his\r\nanalysis deeper than this, exhibits only the desperate nature of the\r\nmeans which have to be applied to elicit a meaning from the passage.\r\nKarlowa (_Röm. Rechtsgesch._ i. p. 530) suggests that the tribunes had\r\nallowed accused persons to escape summonses in criminal trials which were\r\nto take place before the Senate—the initiation of such trials belonging\r\nproperly only to the consuls and praetors. He does not seem to feel the\r\nobstacles that beset the path to this conclusion. He has to take _lege\r\nagere_ in the unusual sense of the legal fulfilment of a penal law; he\r\ndoes not show why Tacitus should have written “vocare ex Italia” in\r\nplace of the more natural “vocare a senatu”; he fails to remember that\r\nthe tribunician intercession in a criminal trial before the Senate was,\r\neven in the reign of Tiberius, becoming a power of pardon vested in the\r\nPrinceps, and that its use by an ordinary tribune might bring death to\r\nthe rash interceder (Tac. _Ann._ vi. 47; cf. xvi 26).\r\n\r\nTo discover the true sense of the passage we must seek for some sphere in\r\nwhich the tribunician veto continued unimpaired during the Principate;\r\nbut, before doing this, we must ask whether the words used by Tacitus\r\noffer any suggestions of such a sphere. It is possible to translate\r\nthe words “vocare ex Italia” as meaning “to summon from any part of\r\nItaly,” “to summon, i.e., from Rome and Italy”; but I venture to think\r\nthat _ex Italia_ excludes the idea of Rome, and that the meaning of the\r\nwords is “to summon from a municipal town of Italy to Rome.” On what\r\ngrounds such a summons might be made is shown by the words “cum quibus\r\nlege agi posset.” The sphere of the summons is civil jurisdiction in\r\nthe _municipia_ as divided between the Roman and the local authorities\r\nby statute on the settlement which gradually followed the close of the\r\nsocial war—a settlement known to us chiefly through the _lex Rubria_.\r\nThe whole sentence, if literally though somewhat clumsily translated,\r\nwould state that “the tribunes were prohibited from summoning litigants\r\nfrom an Italian town in cases where a civil action at law would have been\r\npossible in that town.”\r\n\r\nOn this hypothesis, the sphere of the tribune’s power referred to is\r\nthe very familiar one of the veto on appeal in civil jurisdiction.\r\nHow frequent the _appellatio_ to the tribunes in matters of civil\r\njurisdiction was during the later Republic is shown by the fact that, out\r\nof the four private orations of Cicero, two—those for Quinctius and for\r\nTullius—record the use of this appeal (Cic. _pro Quinct._ 7, 29; _pro\r\nTullio_ 16, 38, 39); and that this appellate cognisance continued during\r\nthe Principate is shown by the obvious interpretation of the well-known\r\nlines of Juvenal (vii. 228)—\r\n\r\n    Rara tamen merces quae cognitione tribuni\r\n    Non egeat—\r\n\r\nwords which almost certainly mean “it is seldom that such _merces_ does\r\nnot lead to a court of appeal.”\r\n\r\nIt may seem strange that the veto of these purely city magistrates should\r\nbe thought of in connexion with municipal jurisdiction, until we remember\r\nthe anomalous nature of the settlement made after the social war. By\r\nthat settlement jurisdiction in Italy is a mere annexe to jurisdiction\r\nin Rome; technically it is jurisdiction in Rome, as is shown by Gaius\r\n(iv. 103-105), who recognises no interval between the jurisdiction of\r\nlaw _intra primum miliarium_ and the jurisdiction of the _imperium_ in\r\nthe provinces. The praetor’s formula and the praetor’s writ run through\r\nthe whole of Italy, although the praetor himself cannot quit Rome for\r\nmore than ten days during his year of office (Cic. _Phil._ ii. 13, 31);\r\nand, if the appellate power of the tribune was to be preserved, it had to\r\nbe regarded as coextensive with the _imperium_, of the magistrate whom\r\nhe vetoed. The intercession of the tribune in municipal jurisdiction\r\nrequired no creation by law; it was still the veto of one city magistrate\r\nby another within the walls of Rome. If even the tribune’s ordinances\r\nand his _coercitio_ were valid without the walls, it could be explained\r\nin accordance with the prevailing fiction; but the supposition of such\r\nan extension is not absolutely necessary, as the following pictures of\r\nwhat probably took place in a conflict between the central and the local\r\ncourts will show.\r\n\r\nSuppose Aulus Agerius brings an action against Numerius Negidius in the\r\ntown of Arpinum. The local magistrate decides to take the case. Numerius\r\nNegidius denies the competence of the court and appeals; to whom? In the\r\nfirst instance, probably to the colleague of the local magistrate, for\r\nthe _lex Rubria_ (c. xx.) forbids the intercession only in the case where\r\nthe local court is admittedly competent. This colleague pronounces the\r\nveto, the _judicium_ is quashed; all that the local magistrate can now do\r\nis to compel the parties to enter into a _vadimonium_ to appear before\r\nthe praetor, and the case moves to Rome. But supposing, when it has got\r\nthere, that the praetor decides that it was really within the competence\r\nof the municipal magistrate and issues an order that it shall go back?\r\nNow Numerius appeals to the tribune. The veto is issued and, if the case\r\nis to be tried at all, the praetor is bound to take it.\r\n\r\nWe can also imagine a case with the same preliminaries in which Numerius\r\nappeals to the colleague of the local magistrate against the competence\r\nof the local court, but in which this colleague declines to interfere.\r\nIs Numerius left stranded? Unquestionably there must have been in such\r\na case a further appeal to Rome, whether to the praetor or perhaps, in\r\nthis case, to his higher colleague the consul. But the praetor or consul\r\nnow decides against Numerius. The appeal is made to the tribune, and the\r\ndecree of the consul or praetor may be quashed. The case, if it is to be\r\ntried at all, must be tried at Rome.\r\n\r\nIn both these instances the tribune pronounces his veto within the city,\r\nand yet in both, if his decision is improper, his position is one of\r\n“vocare ex Italia cum quibus lege agi posset.” In both cases it is not\r\na true use of magisterial _vocatio_, and thus one of the difficulties\r\ndiscovered by commentators in this passage is removed; it is simply an\r\nillustration of the positive effects of a negative power. Just as the\r\ntribune can by a persistent veto force the praetor to alter his formula\r\n(Cic. _Acad. Prior._ ii. 30, 97; _pro Tullio_ 16, 38), so by a persistent\r\ndenial of the praetor’s orders to the local magistrate he can force the\r\npraetor to judge. We do not know the method by which the positive effect\r\nof the veto was in this case secured, but it is clear that some means\r\nmust have been provided for having a municipal action tried at Rome when\r\nthe municipal court had been declared incompetent.\r\n\r\nBut, apart from the procedure springing from these rigid rules of\r\ncompetence, there is some evidence of a discretionary power of what is\r\ncalled _Romam revocatio_, which was exercised and abused by magistrates\r\ntowards the close of the Republic. The _Fragmentum Atestinum_ (perhaps\r\na part of the _lex Rubria_) enacts (l. 16 sq.) with reference to\r\nmunicipal jurisdiction—“ejus rei pequn[_iaeve_] quo magis privato Romae\r\nrevocatio sit ... _ex hac lege nihilum rogatur_,” i.e. this law does\r\nnot permit (or imply) a _revocatio_ to Rome in the specified cases. We\r\ndo not know what magistrate effected this _revocatio_. With respect to\r\ncriminal jurisdiction in the provinces, it was the duty of the consuls\r\n(Cic. _in Verr._ i. 33, 84); and, if they exercised this power in civil\r\njurisdiction as well, the _jus consulum praeripere_ of our passage\r\nmay refer to tribunician interference with this consular prerogative.\r\nIt may be worth noting that Plutarch (_Caes._ 4) associates the power\r\nwith the tribunes; his narrative of this trial of P. Antonius is almost\r\nunquestionably wrong, but it may be taken to show that in his belief\r\n(i.e. in a belief current during the Principate) the tribunes had\r\nsomething to do with summoning cases to Rome.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have been dealing with the praetor and the _judicia\r\nordinaria_. Is it possible that the tribune also interfered with the\r\nextraordinary jurisdiction created daring the Principate, and thus\r\nwith the judicial powers of the consuls? The consular jurisdiction\r\nin _fideicommissa_ had been given to praetors by Claudius (_Dig._ 1,\r\n2, 2, 32), but not the whole of it. Quintilian shows that in greater\r\nmatters it still belonged to the former (_Inst. Or._ iii. 6, 70 “non\r\ndebes apud praetorem petere fideicommissum sed apud consules, major\r\nenim praetoria cognitione summa est”). If the consuls tried the case\r\nwhen the _fideicommissum_ was very large and the praetors when it was\r\nsmaller, it is not altogether impossible that the municipal magistrates\r\nmight have tried local cases when the sum, which was the subject of\r\nthe trust, was insignificant It is thus possible that questions of\r\nthe competence of local and Roman magistrates may have cropped up in\r\nreference to this question; although I should prefer to explain the _jus\r\nconsulum praeripere_ of Tacitus on the already mentioned hypotheses of\r\nsome consular right of _vocatio_ or _revocatio_ in matters of ordinary\r\njurisdiction.\r\n\r\nMuch must remain obscure; we cannot get at the details of the procedure.\r\nAll that we can do is to show that there is evidence for the tribune’s\r\ninterference with the rights of magistrates in matters of municipal\r\njurisdiction, and to suggest methods of interference. Nor can we\r\ndetermine the precise limitations of his authority introduced by the\r\nchange of A.D. 56. But it clearly took from the tribune the final\r\ndecision as to when a civil case should be summoned from a municipal\r\ntown to Rome. Either his _intercessio_ in this matter of municipal\r\njurisdiction was abolished, or his veto was made purely suspensory.\r\nIn this very chapter of Tacitus we find that the enforcement of the\r\ntribunician _multa_ is subjected to the decision of the consul.\r\nSimilarly, with reference to the power which we have discussed, the urban\r\npraetor or the consul may have been declared absolutely competent to\r\ndecide, after cognisance, when a case should be tried in the local courts\r\nand when it should be reserved for the tribunals at Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] _Pagus_ (connected etymologically with πήγνυμι, _pago_, _pango_)\r\nimplies the idea of “foundation” or “settlement.”\r\n\r\n[2] Cf. Liv. ii. 62 “Incendiis deinde non villarum modo, sed etiam\r\nvicorum, quibus frequenter habitabatur, Sabini exciti.”\r\n\r\n[3] So Servius Tullius is said, according to one account, to have divided\r\nthe territory of Rome into twenty-six _pagi_. _Pagus_ is δῆμος in Greek\r\n(Festus p. 72), but this proves little as to its origin; it is the\r\n_pagus_ as part of a state that is thus translated. The δῆμος or δᾶμος in\r\nGreece had often been (as in Elis) a self-existent community.\r\n\r\n[4] Liv. ii. 16. Yet even here the _Claudia gens_ is represented as\r\nexpelled from a _civitas_.\r\n\r\n[5] The ancients derived Palatine from the _balare_ or _palare_ of cattle\r\n(Festus p. 220) or from the shepherd’s god Pales (Solinus i. 15). It is\r\nperhaps derived from the root _pa_ (_pasco_). See O. Gilbert _Geschichte\r\nu. Topographie der Stadt Rom in Altertum_ i. p. 17.\r\n\r\n[6] Tac. _Ann._ xii. 24.\r\n\r\n[7] This tendency is best exhibited in Richter’s map showing the\r\nextension of Rome (Baumeister _Denkmäler_ art. “Rom” Karte v.).\r\n\r\n[8] Festus pp. 340, 341. See Gilbert _Topographie_ i. pp. 38, 162.\r\n\r\n[9] Varro _L.L._ v. 45 ff.\r\n\r\n[10] i.e. in the four city tribes—_Palatina_ (Palatine, Cermalus,\r\nVelia), _Esquilina_ (Oppius, Cispius, Fagutal), _Suburana_ or _Sucusana_\r\n(Coelius, Subura), _Collina_ (Quirinalis, Viminalis—a region outside the\r\nold Septimontium). See Belot _Histoire des Chevaliers Romains_ i. p. 401.\r\n\r\n[11] The Sabine origin of the Tities rested perhaps on the Sabine _sacra_\r\nof the _sodales Titii_ (Tac. _Ann._ i. 54).

Liv. x.\r\n8 (300 B.C.; from the speech of Decius Mus) § 9 “Semper ista audita sunt\r\neadem, penes vos auspicia esse, vos solos gentem habere, vos solos justum\r\nimperium et auspicium domi militiaeque”; § 10 “en unquam fando audistis,\r\npatricios primo esse factos non de coelo demissos sed qui patrem ciere\r\npossent, id est nihil ultra quam ingenuos?”\r\n\r\n[16] Mr. Strachan-Davidson remarks (Smith _Dict. of Antiq._ ii. p. 354)\r\nthat, on the evolution of the rights of the plebeians, these too should\r\nhave been _patricii_, but that the word _patricius_ survived as a “token\r\nof an arrested development.”\r\n\r\n[17] _Plebs_ is connected with the root which appears in _compleo_,\r\n_impleo_, πλῆυος.\r\n\r\n[18] Liv. i. 28 “populum omnem Albanum Romam traducere in animo est,\r\ncivitatem dare plebi, primores in patres legere.” Dionysius (ii. 35)\r\nrepresents the people of Caenina and Antemnae as being, after their\r\nsubjection, enrolled εἰς φυλὰς καὶ φράτρας.\r\n\r\n[19] Cf. Dionysius’ account of Romulus’ institution of clientship (ii.\r\n9 παρακαταθήκας δὲ ἔδωκε τοῖς πατρικίοις τοὺς δημοτικούς, ἐπίτρεψας\r\nἑκάστῳ ... ὃν αὐτὸς ἐβούλετο νέμειν προστάτην ... πατρωνείαν ὀνομάσας τὴν\r\nπροστασίαν).\r\n\r\n[20] The _jus commercii_ has been read into the relations of Rome with\r\nCarthage as depicted in Polybius’ second treaty [Polyb. iii. 24, 12 ἐν\r\nΣικελίᾳ, ἧς Καρχηδόνιοι ἐπάρχουσι, καὶ ἐν Καρχηδόνι πάντα καὶ ποιείτω καὶ\r\nπωλείτω (the Roman) ὅσα καὶ τῷ πολίτῃ (the Carthaginian) ἔξεστιν]. But\r\njurisdiction here may have been the work of some international court, and\r\nthe _jus commercii_, without the _jus exulandi_, would hardly have made a\r\nforeign immigrant a citizen of Rome.\r\n\r\n[21] Cicero shows that there was a controversy whether _applicatio_\r\nwas consistent with _exilium_ (_de Orat._ i. 39, 177), “Quid? quod\r\nitem in centumvirali judicio certatum esse accepimus, qui Romam in\r\nexilium venisset, cui Romae exulare jus esset, si se ad aliquem quasi\r\npatronum applicavisset intestatoque esset mortuus, nonne in ea causa jus\r\napplicationis, obscurum sane et ignotum, patefactum in judicio atque\r\nillustratum est a patrono?”\r\n\r\n[22] Zonaras vii. 15. P. Clodius first tried this method; when it\r\nwas opposed he resorted to the artifice of adoption. Courtly writers\r\nimagined a _transitio_ for the plebeian Octavii, Suet. _Aug._ 2 “Ea gens\r\na Tarquinio Prisco rege inter minores gentes adlecta ... mox a Servio\r\nTullio in patricias transducta, procedente tempore ad plebem se contulit.”\r\n\r\n[23] Liv. ii. 16 (504 B.C.) “Attus Clausus (driven out from Regillum)\r\nmagna clientium comitatus manu Romam transfugit.

Lege hereditas ad\r\ngentem Minuciam veniebat”; _de Leg._ ii. 22, 55 “Jam tanta religio est\r\nsepulchrorum, ut extra sacra et gentem inferri fas negent esse; idque\r\napud majores nostros A. Torquatus in gente Popilia judicavit.”\r\n\r\n[39] The theory of the artificial origin of the _gens_ is based on the\r\nsymmetrical figures given by tradition. The full numbers of the early\r\n_gentes_ are given as 300; these are symmetrically divided, ten into\r\neach of the thirty _curiae_, as the _curiae_ are divided into the three\r\noriginal tribes. Hence Niebuhr (_Hist. Rome_ i. p. 319) says, “The\r\nnumerical scale of the _gentes_ is an irrefragable proof that they were\r\nnot more ancient than the constitution, but corporations formed by a\r\nlegislator in harmony with the rest of his scheme.”\r\n\r\n[40] Niebuhr op. cit. p. 333; from Laelius Felix (ap. Gell. xv. 27) “Cum\r\nex generibus hominum suffragium feratur, curiata comitia esse” (_genus_\r\nbecause the assembly came to include Plebeians, some of whom had no\r\n_gentes_).\r\n\r\n[41] Cic. _ad Fam._ ix. 21, 2.\r\n\r\n[42] Momms. _Staatsr._ iii. p. 31.\r\n\r\n[43] Cic. _de Rep._ ii. 20, 35 “(L.

Cf. Serv. in _Aen._ ii. 156.\r\n\r\n[70] Cf. the story of Verginia in Liv. x. 23 (296 B.C.) “Verginiam Auli\r\nfiliam patriciam plebeio nuptam L. Volumnio consuli matronae, quod e\r\npatribus enupsisset, sacris arcuerant.” She then founds an altar to\r\n“Pudicitia plebeia,” in imitation of that to “Pudicitia patricia.”\r\n\r\n[71] ἀνδρὶ κοινωνὸν ἁπάντων χρημάτων τε καὶ ἱερῶν (Dionys. ii. 25).\r\n\r\n[72] Plut. _Qu. Rom._ 30 Διὰ τί τὴν νὺμφην εἰσάγοντες λέγειν κελεύουσιν·\r\nὋπου σὺ Γαΐος ἐγὼ Γαΐα;\r\n\r\n[73] e.g. a testamentary adoption by a public act in the _comitia calata_.\r\n\r\n[74] _Familia_ is etymologically a “household.” Cf. Sanskr. _dhâ_ “to\r\nsettle,” _dhâman_ “settlement.”\r\n\r\n[75] The original term was, perhaps, _manus_ signifying “power” (see p.\r\n32), but this word came in course of time to be restricted to the control\r\nover the wife who had become a member of the _familia_.\r\n\r\n[76] Plutarch (_Rom._ 22) quotes a law of Romulus allowing the divorce of\r\nthe wife ἐπὶ φαρμακείᾳ τέκνων ἢ κλειδῶν ὑποβίλῃ καὶ μοιχευθεῖσαν.\r\n\r\n[77] Dionys. ii. 15.\r\n\r\n[78] This _jus noxae dationis_ first disappears finally in the law of\r\nJustinian (_Inst._ iv. 8, 7; _Dig._ 43, 29, 3, 4). Before its abolition\r\na modification had been introduced by the rule that, when the child had\r\nacquired an equivalent for the damage he had caused (_quantum damni\r\ndedit_), the owner should be forced to manumit him.\r\n\r\n[79] Even by Constantine the sale of new-born children (_sanguinolenti_)\r\nwas permitted, but only _propter nimiam paupertatem_ (_Cod._ 4, 43, 2).\r\n\r\n[80] “Pater si filium ter venum duuit, filius a patre liber esto.” It has\r\nbeen thought, however, that by the time of the Twelve Tables the sale had\r\nbecome merely fictitious.\r\n\r\n[81] This _vindicatio filii_ was in later Roman law replaced by a writ\r\nissued by the praetor (_interdictum de liberis exhibendis_), the effects\r\nof which were like that of Habeas Corpus.\r\n\r\n[82] Dionys. ii. 26, 27.\r\n\r\n[83] Gell. v. 19, 9.\r\n\r\n[84] Hadrian punished the killing of a son with deportation (_Dig._ 48,\r\n8, 5); Constantine declared it _parricidium_.\r\n\r\n[85] Instances are given in Voigt (_Zwölf Tafeln_ ii 94). M. Fabius Buteo\r\n(223-218 B.C.) put his son to death as a punishment for theft (Oros. iv.\r\n13), and a certain Pontius Aufidianus his daughter for immorality (Val.\r\nMax. vi. 1, 3); there are also instances of banishment inflicted by the\r\nfather, presumably under the threat of inflicting the death penalty if\r\nthe children returned.\r\n\r\n[86] We may cite two instances lying at the very extremes of Republican\r\nhistory, the semi-mythical one of L. Junius Brutus in 509 (Plut. _Popl._\r\n6, 7), and the historical one of A. Fulvius Nobilior, who in 63 B.C. put\r\nhis son to death for partnership in the Catilinarian conspiracy (Sall.\r\n_Cat._ 39).\r\n\r\n[87] Modern writers are inclined to reject the appeal made to the _sexus\r\nfragilitas_ by the Roman jurists, and to believe that the original motive\r\nlay in the desire to keep the property of the family together (cf.\r\nCzyhlarz _Inst._ p. 275); but, as this motive did not operate in the case\r\nof sons, it is difficult to see why it should have done so in the case\r\nof the wife or daughters, apart from a belief in the incapability of\r\nwomen to defend their own claims. For the motive underlying the _tutela\r\nmulierum_ see p. 31.\r\n\r\n[88] p. 16.\r\n\r\n[89] Ulp. _Reg._ 12, 2 “Lex xii. Tab. prodigum, cui bonis interdictum\r\nest, in curatione jubet esse agnatorum”; cf. Ulp. in _Dig._ 27, 10, 1\r\n“Lege xii. Tab. prodigo interdicitur bonorum suorum administratio.” There\r\ncan be no doubt of the antiquity of this interdiction of the “prodigus,”\r\nproceeding as it does from the theory that the property belongs to the\r\nfamily rather than to its head; but from what authority it proceeded in\r\nthe earliest period of Roman history is uncertain.\r\n\r\n[90] See the account in Val. Max. v. 8, 2 (p. 23) “adhibito propinquoram\r\net amicoram consilio.”\r\n\r\n[91] Val. Max. ii. 9, 2 “M. Val. Maximus et C. Junius Brutus Bubulcus\r\ncensores ... L. Annium senatu moverunt, quod, quam virginem in\r\nmatrimonium duxerat, repudiasset, nullo amicorum in consilio adhibito.”\r\nSee Greenidge _Infamia in Roman Law_ p. 65.\r\n\r\n[92] Dionys. ii. 26, 27.\r\n\r\n[93] For the alleged lateness of divorce at Rome, even after the Twelve\r\nTables had freely permitted it, see Gell. iv. 3 (_Infamia in Roman Law_\r\np. 65).\r\n\r\n[94] _Dig._ i. 6, 9 (Pomponius) “filius familias in publicis causis loco\r\npatris familias habetur, veluti ut magistratum gerat, ut tutor detur.”\r\nCompare the story in Liv. xxiv. 44 (213 B.C.) “Pater filio legatus ad\r\nSuessulam in castra venit”—the consul went to meet him; and the old man\r\non horseback passed eleven lictors—“ut consul animadvertere proximum\r\nlictorem jussit et is, ut descenderet ex equo, inclamavit, tum demum\r\ndesiliens, ‘Experiri,’ inquit, ‘volui, fili, satin’ scires consulem te\r\nesse.” Cf. Gell. ii. 2.\r\n\r\n[95] Festus s.v. _Duicensus_ (p. 66) “dicebatur cum altero, id est cum\r\nfilio census.”\r\n\r\n[96] Probably by a _mancipatio fiduciae causa_, one, i.e., by which he\r\nhad formally transferred (_mancipavit_) his body on the condition that it\r\nwas not to be seized for a certain time, and that the transfer should be\r\ndissolved (_solutio nexi_) if the debt were paid within this time.\r\n\r\n[97] Ulpian Reg. 19, 1; Gaius ii. 15. _Res mancipi_ at a later period\r\nincluded lands in Italy (with their servitudes), slaves and _quadrupedes\r\nquae dorso collove domantur_. In the expression _familia pecuniaque_,\r\n“familia” probably denotes the slaves. Pierron (_Du sens des mots familia\r\npecuniaque_) has shown the theory of Ihering and Cuq, that the former\r\ndenotes _res mancipi_, the latter _res nec mancipi_, to be untenable.\r\n\r\n[98] Plut. _Cato maj._ 3.\r\n\r\n[99] Plut. _Cor._ 24.\r\n\r\n[100] See the section on the censor.\r\n\r\n[101] Paulus in _Dig._ 28, 2, 11 “in suis heredibus evidentius apparet\r\ncontinuationem dominii eo rem perducere, ut nulla videatur hereditas\r\nfuisse, quasi olim hi domini essent, qui etiam vivo patre quodammodo\r\ndomini existimantur.” What the _filius familias_ acquires by the death of\r\nhis father is merely _libera bonorum administratio_.\r\n\r\n[102] Gell. i. 9 “Tamquam illud fuit anticum consortium, quod jure atque\r\nverbo Romano appellabatur ‘ercto non cito’”; Serv. in _Aen._ viii. 642\r\n“‘citae’ divisae, ut est in jure ‘ercto non cito,’ id est patrimonis vel\r\nhereditate non divisa.”\r\n\r\n[103] Gell. xv. 27 “Isdem comitiis, quae ‘calata’ appellari diximus,\r\net sacrorum detestatio et testamenta fieri solebant. Tria enim genera\r\ntestamentorum fuisse accepimus; unum, quod calatis comitiis in populi\r\ncontione fieret, alterum in procinctu, cum viri ad proelium faciendum in\r\naciem vocabantur, tertium per familiae emancipationem, cui aes et libra\r\nadhiberetur”; Gaius ii. 101 “aut calatis comitiis faciebant, quae comitia\r\nbis in anno testamentis faciendis destinata erant; aut in procinctu, id\r\nest, cum belli causa arma sumebant.” Cf. Ulpian (_Reg._ 20, 2) on the\r\n_testamentorum genera tria_.\r\n\r\n[104] This testament is never associated with adrogation, although this\r\ntook place before the same assembly.\r\n\r\n[105] In Gell. (cited n. 1) it is associated with the _sacrorum\r\ndetestatio_ (see p. 16), and perhaps this was its main object. The\r\npontiffs and people had to be satisfied that the _sacra_ would be\r\ncontinued and the family not become extinct.\r\n\r\n[106] See the passages of Gellius, Gaius, and Ulpian, cited n. 1, and\r\ncompare Festus p. 225 “procincta classis dicebatur, cum exercitus cinctus\r\nerat Gabino cinctu confestim pugnaturus.” In the second century B.C. we\r\nfind some kind of military testament, called by this name, made by Roman\r\nsoldiers in Spain (Velleius ii. 5 “facientibus ... omnibus in procinctu\r\ntestamenta, velut ad certam mortem eundum foret”).\r\n\r\n[107] Gaius ii. 102 “Qui neque calatis comitiis, neque in procinctu\r\ntestamentum fecerat, is, si subita morte urguebatur, amico familiam suam,\r\nid est, patrimonium suum mancipio dabat, eumque rogabat, quod cuique post\r\nmortem suam dari vellet.”\r\n\r\n[108] Gaius ii. 104 “Familiam pecuniamque tuam endo mandatela tutela\r\ncustodelaque mea, quo tu jure testamentum facere possis secundum legem\r\npublicam, hoc aere esto mihi empta.” For _familia pecuniaque_ see p. 24.\r\n\r\n[109] The stipulation that it was a trust would still have taken the\r\npatrimony wholly from the testator during the remainder of his life. We\r\nhear nothing about the formal reservation of a life interest.\r\n\r\n[110] “Cum nexum faciet mancipiumque, uti lingua nuncupassit ita jus\r\nesto.”\r\n\r\n[111] Gaius ii. 104 “Haec ita, ut in his tabulis cerisque scripta sunt,\r\nita do, ita lego, ita testor, itaque vos, quirites, testimonium mihi\r\nperhibetote.”\r\n\r\n[112] Plut. _Comp. Lyc. c. Num._ 4 λέγεται γούν ποτε γυναικὸς εἰπούσης\r\nδίκην ἰδίαν ἐν ἀγορᾷ πέμψαι τὴν σύγκλητον εἰς θεοῦ, πυνθανομένην, τίνος\r\nἅρα τῇ πόλει σημεῖον εἴη τὸ γεγενημένον.\r\n\r\n[113] Such as the _lex Claudia_, which abolished the _legitima tutela\r\nagnatorum_ (Gaius i. 171).\r\n\r\n[114] A trace of the old disability survives in the prohibition of\r\nadvocacy to women; the praetors declined to grant them a formula on\r\nbehalf of others. A certain Carfania (Gaia Afrania) “inverecunde\r\npostulans et magistratum inquietans” is said to have been the occasion of\r\nthis rule (Ulp. in _Dig._ 3, 11, 5).\r\n\r\n[115] This usage was preserved in the praetor’s edict; he spoke of “qui\r\nquaeve ... capite deminuti deminutaeve esse dicentur” (_Dig._ 4, 5, 2,\r\n1), meaning what the later jurists call _cap. dem. minima_, i.e. loss of\r\n_familia_.\r\n\r\n[116] See Eisele “Zur Natur u. Geschichte der capitis deminutio” in\r\n_Beiträge zur Römischen Rechtsgeschichte_ p. 160. He combats the counter\r\nview that _capitis dem._ meant an annihilation of personality. Mommsen\r\n(_Staatsr._ iii. 8) takes this latter view—a natural result of juristic\r\nrefinement, but a conception that would have been quite unintelligible to\r\na primitive community.\r\n\r\n[117] Gaius i. 162 “Minima capitis deminutio est, cum et civitas et\r\nlibertas retinetur, sed status hominis commutator; quod accidit in his\r\nqui adoptantur, item in his quae coemptionem faciunt, et in his qui\r\nmancipio dantur, quique ex mancipatione manumittuntur.”\r\n\r\n[118] Liv. i. 32.\r\n\r\n[119] Gell. i. 12, 14; x. 24, 3.\r\n\r\n[120] Mommsen (_Staatsr._ iii. 3, n. 2) connects the word with\r\n_populari_. The _magister populi_ (i.e. the dictator) is master of the\r\ninfantry host.\r\n\r\n[121] Varro ap. Dionys. ii 48. Other views derived it from the Sabine\r\ntown Cures (Varro _L.L._ v. 51; Strabo v. 3, 1) or connected it with\r\n_Curia_ (Lange _Röm. Alt._ i. p. 89; Belot _Hist. d. Chev. Rom._ i. p.\r\n312).\r\n\r\n[122] Suet. _Jul._ 70.\r\n\r\n[123] Capito ap. Gell. i. 20 “Plebes ... in qua gentes civium patriciae\r\nnon insunt: plebiscitum ... est ... lex, quam plebes, non populus,\r\naccipit.” Cf. Festus p. 233.\r\n\r\n[124] According to the primitive conception private are dependent on\r\npublic rights; see p. 31. But the growth of the Plebs, and alliances with\r\nother states, had effected many modifications in this conception.\r\n\r\n[125] Nonius, s.v. _plebitas_, p. 101 “Hemina in annalibus, ‘Quicumque\r\npropter plebitatem agro publico ejecti sunt.’” Cf. Liv. iv. 48.\r\n\r\n[126] p. 17.\r\n\r\n[127] Cic. _de Leg._ ii. 13, 32 (on the question whether auspices were\r\nmerely directed to the _utilitas_ of the state, or formed a true method\r\nof divination) “si enim deos esse concedimus ... et eosdem hominum\r\nconsulere generi, et posse nobis signa rerum futurarum ostendere; non\r\nvideo cur esse divinationem negem.”\r\n\r\n[128] Cic. _de Div._ ii. 33, 70 (the difficulty of answering for results\r\nmay appeal to a _Marsus augur_ but not to a Roman) “non enim sumus\r\nii nos augures, qui avium reliquorumve signorum observatione futura\r\ndicamus.” Cf. i. 58, 132 “Non habeo ... nauci Marsum augurem, non vicanos\r\nharuspices, non de circo astrologos, non Isiacos conjectores, non\r\ninterpretes somniorum. Non enim sunt ii aut scientia aut arte divini.”\r\n\r\n[129] See the treatment of the auspices in the section on the magistracy\r\n(p. 163).\r\n\r\n[130] Strangely enough the Greek belief in oracular or prophetic power\r\ndid not lead to the conception of a priesthood set apart from the people.\r\nBut the Greek science of divination, though associated with oracles\r\nand prophecy, did not aim much higher than the Roman. Its object was\r\ngenerally to win approval for a contemplated course of action.\r\n\r\n[131] Cic. _de Leg._ ii. 8, 21 “Quaeque augur injusta, nefasta, vitiosa,\r\ndira defixerit, inrita infectaque sunto; quique non paruerit, capital\r\nesto.”\r\n\r\n[132] Serv. ad _Aen._ vi. 190 “auguria aut oblativa sunt, quae non\r\nposcuntur, aut impetrativa, quae optata veniunt.” For the categories of\r\nthese two kinds of auspices see the discussion of the auspices in the\r\nsection on the magistracy (p. 162).\r\n\r\n[133] Liv. vi. 41 “Auspiciis hanc urbem conditam esse, auspiciis bello ac\r\npace, domi militiaeque omnia geri, quis est qui ignoret?”\r\n\r\n[134] This view is most fully expressed in the formalities of the\r\n_interregnum_. See the section which treats of this institution (p. 147).\r\n\r\n[135] Cic. _de Div._ i. 16, 28 “Nihil fere quondam majoris rei, nisi\r\nauspicato, ne privatim quidem, gerebatur: quod etiam nunc nuptiarum\r\nauspices declarant, qui, re omissa, nomen tantum tenent.” In i. 17, 31\r\nwe have the story of Attus Navius taking auspices by _aves_ in a private\r\nmatter. Cf. Liv. vi. 41.\r\n\r\n[136] Cic. _de Div._ i. 16, 28 (see last note); Suet. _Claud._ 26; Tac.\r\n_Ann._ xi. 27.\r\n\r\n[137] Liv. iv. 2 “Quas quantasque res C. Canuleium adgressum? Conluvionem\r\ngentium, perturbationem auspiciorum publicorum privatorumque adferre.”\r\nYet this passage has only an indirect reference to the matrimonial\r\n_auspicia_. The argument is that intermarriage would cause the pure\r\nPatriciate to disappear, and with it the general right of taking\r\n_auspicia impetrativa_.\r\n\r\n[138] Cic. _de Div._ ii. 36, 76 “a populo auspicia accepta habemus.” The\r\nrelation of _auspicia habere_ to the _spectio_ is that the former denotes\r\nthe abstract right of questioning the gods, the latter its exercise in\r\na particular case (Momms. _Staatsr._ i. 89 n. 3). The specification by\r\nthe magistrate of the signs which he wished to see was known as _legum\r\ndictio_ (Serv. ad _Aen._ iii. 89; cf. p. 43 n. 2).\r\n\r\n[139] A similar confusion was at an earlier period introduced with\r\nreference to the givers of the auspices. They are said to be given by\r\nthe people (Cic. _de Div._ ii. 36, 76; p. 39), but the great bulk of the\r\npeople (i.e. the Plebs) did not possess them.\r\n\r\n[140] p. 3.\r\n\r\n[141] Dionys. iv. 14 (Servius Tullius) τὰς καταγραφὰς τῶν στρατιωτῶν καὶ\r\nτὰς εἰσπράξεις τῶν χρημάτων ... οὐκέτι κατὰ τὰς τρεῖς φυλὰς τὰς γενικάς,\r\nὡς πρότερον, κ.τ.λ.

On the other hand, in the\r\n_legum dictio_ of augury, which is the statement of the mode of the\r\nanswer of the gods to a request, in the _lex data_ given to individuals\r\nby a magistrate (e.g. the _leges censoriae_) or granted by Rome as a\r\ncharter to a subject state, there seems to be the idea of a purely\r\none-sided ordinance.\r\n\r\n[158] Dionys. iii. 62; Cic. _de Rep._ ii. 17, 31.\r\n\r\n[159] Tac. _Ann._ xi. 22; Ulp. in _Dig._ i. 13.\r\n\r\n[160] Varro _L.L._ v. 80 “Praetor dictus, qui praeiret jure et exercitu.”\r\nBut the title is, perhaps, a purely military one (_prae-itor_, “the man\r\nwho goes before the army”).\r\n\r\n[161] Festus p. 198 “in magistro populi faciendo, qui vulgo Dictator\r\nappellatur.”\r\n\r\n[162] Cic. _de Rep._ i. 26, 42. _Regnum_ denotes the position of the king\r\nas head of the state (ib. ii. 27), but not the regal power.\r\n\r\n[163] _Lictor_ is probably derived from _licere_. For other attempts\r\nat derivation see Gell. xii. 8. They summon, not only to the assembly,\r\nbut also to the courts, and are thus the chief mark of jurisdiction and\r\ncoercive power (_coercitio_). The individual _curiae_ were probably\r\nsummoned by the thirty _lictores curiatii_, who survive into the later\r\nRepublic. See Momms. _Staatsr._ i. p. 392.

But, even in the regal period, there may\r\nhave been one condition which did not vitiate such acts, i.e. death (see\r\np. 29).\r\n\r\n[185] Liv. i. 17, 22, 32, 41, 47.\r\n\r\n[186] Cic. _de Leg._ Agr. ii. 10, 26; ii. 11, 28; _ad Fam._ i. 9, 25.\r\n\r\n[187] Cic. _de Rep._ ii. 13, 25 “Numam ... qui ... quamquam populus\r\ncuriatis eum comitiis regem esse jusserat, tamen ipse de suo imperio\r\ncuriatam legem tulit.”\r\n\r\n[188] Liv. i. 41 “Servius, praesidio firmo munitus, primus injussu\r\npopuli, voluntate patrum regnavit.”\r\n\r\n[189] Cic. _de Rep._ ii. 17, 31 “Tullum Hostilium populus regem,\r\ninterrege rogante, comitiis curiatis creavit, isque de imperio suo ...\r\npopulum consuluit curiatim.”\r\n\r\n[190] The last _injustus dominus_ of Rome ruled “neque populi jussu neque\r\nauctoribus patribus” (Cic. _de Rep._ ii. 24, 45; Liv. i. 49).\r\n\r\n[191] Thus Romulus takes his own auspices on the Palatine (Liv. i. 6).\r\n\r\n[192] p. 39.\r\n\r\n[193] Liv. i. 18 “de se ... deos consuli jussit.”\r\n\r\n[194] Labeo ap.

That the\r\nking was pontiff is stated by Plutarch (_Numa_ 9), Servius (ad _Aen._\r\niii. 81), and Zosimus (iv. 36), but the evidence may be vitiated by the\r\nposition of the Princeps as _pontifex maximus_.\r\n\r\n[203] Liv. i. 20 (p. 51 n. 5); cf.

The same was the case with the Vestal (Gell. i. 12).\r\n\r\n[208] For the Flamen see Liv. xxxi. 50; Festus p. 104.

On the other hand _poena_,\r\n_multa_, _talio_ bear witness to a theory of compensation and private\r\nvengeance.

In the _lex sacrata_ which\r\nprotected the tribunes we meet with this distinction (Liv. iii. 55).\r\n\r\n[221] Festus p. 318 “At homo sacer is est, quem populus judicavit ob\r\nmaleficium; neque fas est eum immolari, sed qui occidit, parricidi non\r\ndamnatur.” This is the meaning of _sacer_ as employed in the _leges\r\nsacratae_ of the early Republic (Liv. ii. 8; iii. 55).\r\n\r\n[222] The _sacramentum_ (literally “oath”) in the _actio sacramento_\r\nis best explained as an atonement (_piaculum_) in the form of a money\r\npayment for the expiable, because involuntary, perjury of the litigant\r\nwho has maintained a false claim. When the process was secularised, the\r\n_sacramentum_ came to be considered a simple wager. See Danz _Der sacrale\r\nSchutz_ pp. 151 ff.\r\n\r\n[223] Cic. _de Rep._ ii. 17, 31 “constituitque jus, quo bella\r\nindicerentur; quod per se justissime inventum sanxit fetiali religione,\r\nut omne bellum, quod denuntiatum indictumque non esset, id injustum esse\r\natque impium judicaretur.”\r\n\r\n[224] Varro _L.L._ v. 86 “Fetiales ... fidei publicae inter populos\r\npraeerant; nam per hos fiebat ut justum conciperetur bellum et inde\r\ndesitum, ut foedere fides pacis constitueretur. Ex his mittebantur,\r\nantequam conciperetur, qui res repeterent, etc.”\r\n\r\n[225] Cic. _de Leg._ ii. 9, 21 “Foederum, pacis, belli, indutiarum\r\nratorum fetiales judices nuntii sunto; bella disceptanto.” The word\r\n_fetialis_ is probably connected with _fateri_ (and Oscan _fatium_). Thus\r\nthe “Fetiales” are speakers (_oratores_), cf. Festus p. 182. Dionysius\r\n(ii. 72) ascribes the creation of the Fetiales to Numa; Livy (i. 32)\r\nspeaks as if they were due to Ancus Martius, but in another passage (i.\r\n24) implies their earlier existence. Cicero attributes them to Tullus\r\nHostilius (Cic. _de Rep._ ii. 17, 31). The ceremonies of the college are\r\ndescribed in Dionys. ii. 72 and Liv. i. 32.\r\n\r\n[226] Sometimes, the better to secure divine assistance, the enemy, his\r\ncities, and his lands were all devoted to the gods. For the incantation\r\nsee Macrob. iii. 9, 10 “Dis pater Vejovis Manes, sive quo alio nomine\r\nfas est nominare ... uti vos eas urbes agrosque capita aetatesque eorum\r\ndevotas consecratasque habeatis ollis legibus, quibus quandoque sunt\r\nmaxime hostes devoti; eosque ego ... do devoveo.” The site of such cities\r\nwas cursed, as in Republican times that of Fregellae, Carthage, and\r\nCorinth.\r\n\r\n[227] Macrob. iii. 9, 7 “Si deus, si dea est, cui populus civitasque\r\n... est in tutela, teque maxime, ille qui urbis hujus populique tutelam\r\nrecepisti ... a vobis peto ut vos populum civitatemque ... deseratis ...\r\nproditique Romam ad me meosque veniatis, nostraque vobis loca templa\r\nsacra urbs acceptior probatiorque sit.”\r\n\r\n[228] Cincius ap. Arnob. iii. 38 “solere Romanos religiones urbium\r\nsuperatarum partim privatim per familias spargere, partim publice\r\nconsecrare.”\r\n\r\n[229] e.g. the _evocatio_ at the siege of Veii, the _devotio_ on the fall\r\nof Carthage.\r\n\r\n[230] Plut. _Ti. Gracch._ 15; Tac. _Ann._ iii. 26. See next citation.\r\n\r\n[231] Tac. _Ann._ iii. 26 “nobis Romulus, ut libitum, imperitaverat: dein\r\nNuma religionibus et divino jure populum devinxit, repertaque quaedam a\r\nTullo et Anco. Sed praecipuus Servius Tullius sanctor legum fuit, quis\r\netiam reges obtemperarent.”\r\n\r\n[232] Pomponius in _Dig._ 1, 2, 2 “et ita leges quasdam et ipse (Romulus)\r\ncuriatas ad populum tulit; tulerunt et sequentes reges. Quae omnes\r\nconscriptæ extant in libro Sexti Papirii, qui fuit illis temporibus,\r\nquibus Superbus Demarati Corinthii filius, ex principalibus viris. Is\r\nliber, ut diximus, appellatur jus civile Papirianum, non quia Papirius\r\nde suo quicquam ibi adjecit, sed quod leges sine ordine latas in unum\r\ncomposuit.” This code was commented on by Granius Flaccus (Paul. in\r\n_Dig._ 50, 16, 144), a contemporary of Julius Caesar. C. Papirius is\r\nsaid to have been _pontifex maximus_ (Dionys. iii. 36), and Mommsen\r\n(_Staatsr._ ii. p. 41) thinks that the _leges regiae_ were simply\r\npontifical ordinances, specifying amongst other things such offences as\r\nwe have mentioned as coming under _fas_ (p. 54).\r\n\r\n[233] Sall. _Cat._ 6 “imperium legitimum, nomen imperii regium habebant.”\r\n\r\n[234] “Regium consilium” (Cic. _de Rep._ ii. 8, 14). The function of the\r\nSenate was περὶ παντὸς ὃτου ἂν εἰσηγῆται βασιλεὺς διαγινὼσκειν (Dionys.\r\nii. 14).\r\n\r\n[235] Festus p. 246 “Praeteriti senatores quondam in opprobrio non\r\nerant, quod, ut reges sibi legebant sublegebantque, quos in consilio\r\npublico haberent, ita post exactos eos consules quoque et tribuni militum\r\nconsulari potestate conjunctissimos sibi quosque patriciorum et deinde\r\nplebeiorum legebant.”\r\n\r\n[236] p. 13.\r\n\r\n[237] Liv. i. 8.\r\n\r\n[238] ib. 17 and 35; ii. 1.

One of the privileges of the people was περὶ\r\nπολέμου διαγινώσκειν ὃταν ὁ βασιλεύς ἐφῇ.\r\n\r\n[243] Cic. _de Rep._ ii. 9, 15 “Cum ipse (Romulus) nihil ex praeda domum\r\nsuam reportaret, locupletare cives non destitit”; ii. 14, 26 “ac primum\r\nagros, quos bello Romulus ceperat, divisit viritim civibus.” Cf. Dionys.\r\nii. 28 and 62.\r\n\r\n[244] Liv. i. 49 “cognitiones capitalium rerum sine consiliis per se\r\nsolus exercebat.”\r\n\r\n[245] ib. 59; see p. 41.\r\n\r\n[246] Tac. _Ann._ vi. 11 “namque antea, profectis domo regibus ac mox\r\nmagistratibus, ne urbs sine imperio foret, in tempus deligebatur qui jus\r\nredderet ac subitis mederetur ... duratque simulacrum, quotiens ob ferias\r\nLatinas praeficitur qui consulare munus usurpet.” Cf. Liv. i. 59; Dionys.\r\nii. 12.\r\n\r\n[247] Yet Livy and Dionysius represent the _tribunus celerum_ as\r\nsummoning the assembly (Liv. i. 59; Dionys. iv. 71).\r\n\r\n[248] Dionys. ii. 14 (amongst the powers of the king were) τῶν τε\r\nἀδικημάτων τὰ μέγιστα μὲν αὐτὸν δικάζειν, τὰ δ’ ἐλάττονα τοῖς βουλευταῖς\r\nἐπιτρέπειν. It is difficult, however, to determine whether the reference\r\nis to civil wrongs or to crimes.\r\n\r\n[249] ib. iv. 25 ἐκεῖνος (Servius Tullius) διελὼν ἀπὸ τῶν ἰδιωτικῶν\r\n(ἐγκλημάτων) τὰ δημόσια, τῶν μὲν εἰς τὸ κοινὸν φερόντων ἀδικημάτων\r\nαὐτὸς ἐποιεῖτο τὰς διαγνώσεις, τῶν δὲ ἰδιωτικῶν ἰδιώτας ἔταξεν εἶναι\r\nδικαστάς, ὅρους καὶ κανόνας αὐτοῖς τάξας, οὓς αὐτὸς ἔγραψε νόμους. The\r\nprinciple here described perhaps refers to delegation rather than to the\r\ndistinction between _jus_ and _judicium_ in civil process.\r\n\r\n[250] For derivations of _jus_ see Clark _Pract. Jurisprudence_ pp.\r\n16-20; Bréal “Sur l’origine des mots designant le droit en Latin” in\r\n_Nouvelle Revue Historique de droit_ vol. vii.

Cf. Varro _L.L._ v. 81. Mommsen (_Staatsr._ ii. pp. 523 sq.)\r\nthinks the financial quaestors as standing officials originated with\r\nthe Republic; but he believes (p. 539) that they had their origin in\r\nthe criminal _quaestores_ (a word which bears the same relation to\r\n_quaesitores_ as _sartor_ to _sarcitor_ or _quaero_ to _quaesivi_, p.\r\n537).

Ihering _Geist des röm.

Gaius iv. 93 (of the\r\n_actio per sponsionem_) “Provocamus adversarium tali sponsione.”\r\n\r\n[260] “In this conflict of competence the position of the king was far\r\nmore favourable than that of the people, since the people could only\r\nbe summoned by the king. Hence the share of the people in criminal\r\njurisdiction was reduced to a minimum” (Ihering _Geist des röm. Rechts_\r\ni. p. 258).\r\n\r\n[261] “Judiciis regiis” (Cic. _de Rep._ v. 2, 3).\r\n\r\n[262] p. 56.\r\n\r\n[263] Savigny _System_, vi. p. 287; Bernhöft _Staat und Recht der\r\nKönigszeit_ p. 230. The idea of its being an innovation has sometimes\r\nbeen associated with Dionysius’s description (iv. 25, see p. 62) of a\r\nchange in jurisdiction introduced by Servius Tullius.\r\n\r\n[264] Cic. _pro Cluent._ 43, 120 “Neminem voluerunt majores nostri non\r\nmodo de existimatione cujusquam, sed ne pecuniaria quidem de re minima\r\nesse judicem, nisi qui inter adversarios convenisset.”\r\n\r\n[265] Ihering _Geist des röm. Rechts_ i. p. 169.\r\n\r\n[266] Dionys. iv. 22 ὁ δὲ Τύλλιος καὶ τοῖς ἐλευθερουμένοις τῶν θεραπόντων\r\n... μετέχειν τῆς ἰσοπολιτείας ἐπέτρεψε ... καὶ πάντων ἀπέδωκε τῶν κοινῶν\r\nαὐτοῖς μετέχειν, ὧν τοῖς ἄλλοις δημοτικοῖς.\r\n\r\n[267] The change, however, was not supposed (except perhaps by Tacitus\r\n_Ann._ iii. 26, see p. 58) to rest on a _rogatio_. Mommsen (_Staatsr._\r\niii. p. 161) explains this tradition by noting that the alteration was a\r\nmere administrative act, which would fall within the competence of the\r\nking.\r\n\r\n[268] It is possible that these three tribes would have been to some\r\nextent local; but locality was an accident. Membership of them was\r\ntransmitted by birth.\r\n\r\n[269] Dionysius (iv. 22) makes them at a later time members of the\r\n_curiae_.\r\n\r\n[270] Dionys. iv. 14; Gell. xv. 27.\r\n\r\n[271] Cic. _pro Flacco_ 32, 80 “sintne ista praedia censui censendo,\r\nhabeant jus civile, sint necne sint mancipi?... in qua tribu denique ista\r\npraedia censuisti?” The _ager publicus_ was not included in the tribes,\r\nnor were the Capitol and Aventine, because they were not private, but\r\npublic property (Liv. vi. 20; Dionys. x. 31 and 32).\r\n\r\n[272] Liv. i. 43 “Quadrifariam urbe divisa, regionibusque et collibus,\r\nqui habitabantur, partes eas tribus appellavit”; Dionys. iv. 14 ὁ\r\nΤύλλιος, ἐπείδη τούς ἑπτὰλόφους ἐνὶ τείχει περιέλαβεν, εἰς τέτταρας\r\nμοίρας διελὼν τὴν πόλιν ... τετράφυλον ἐποίησε τὴν πόλιν εἶναι, τρίφυλον\r\nοὖσαν τέως.. So Festus p. 368 “urbanas tribus appellabant, in quas urbs\r\nerat dispertita a Ser. Tullio rege.” Cf. Varro _L.L._ v. 56. Mommsen\r\n(_Staatsr._ iii. p. 163) now holds that the tribes were “parts of the\r\nstate-town limited by the _pomerium_.” Ostia, once thought to belong to\r\nPalatina, has been shown to belong to Voturia. But the reason for this\r\nmay be the subsequent loss of the _territorium_ of the city. See p. 68.\r\n\r\n[273] Momms. _Staatsr._ iii. p. 168. Rome was at this time a great\r\ncommercial state (cf. treaty with Carthage, 509 B.C.). That such a\r\nprimitive institution as gentile tenure could have existed at this time\r\nis inconceivable.\r\n\r\n[274] Dionys. iv. 15 διεῖλε δὲ καὶ τὴν χώραν ἅπασαν, ὡς μὲν Φάβιός\r\nφησιν, εἰς μοίρας ἕξ τε καὶ εἴκοσιν, ἃς καὶ αὐτὰς καλεῖ φυλάς. Mommsen\r\n(_Staatsr._ iii. p. 169) seems to lean to the view that those country\r\ndistricts, comprising land not in quiritarian ownership, were _pagi_.\r\n\r\n[275] _Sucusana_ (or _Suburana_), _Palatina_, _Esquilina_, and _Collina_.\r\nSee p. 3.\r\n\r\n[276] Cf. Momms. _Staatsr._ iii. p. 125 “The four tribes are probably\r\nnothing more than the three Romulian increased through the _territorium_\r\nof the town on the Quirinal”; p. 164 “Servian Rome, probably a double\r\ntown composed of the old city, Palatine and Esquiline, and the new town\r\nof the Colline.”\r\n\r\n[277] Districts like Ostia, which must have belonged to the Servian\r\ntribes, now formed parts of the new creations (see p. 67).\r\n\r\n[278] Servius is said for this reason to have prohibited transference of\r\ndomicile or allotment. Dionys. iv. 14 (Servius) τοὺς ἀνθρῶπους ἔταξε τοὺς\r\nἐν ἑκάστῃ μοίρᾳ τῶν τεττάρων οἰκοῦντας, ὥσπερ κωμήτας, μήτε μεταλαμβάνειν\r\nἑτέραν οἴκησιν μήτ’ ἄλλοθι που συντελεῖν.\r\n\r\n[279] Momms. _Staatsr._ iii. pp. 182, 184.\r\n\r\n[280] Laelius Felix ap. Gell. xv. 27 “Cum ex generibus hominum suffragium\r\nferatur, ‘curiata’ comitia esse, cum ex censu et aetate ‘centuriata,’ cum\r\nex regionibus et locis, ‘tributa.’”\r\n\r\n[281] Servius himself is credited with the introduction of _aes\r\nsignatum_—carefully adjusted copper weights stamped by authority. Plin.\r\n_H.N._ xviii. 3 “Servius rex ovum boumque effigie primus aes signavit.”\r\nMommsen (_Römisches Münzwesen_) thinks that the stamp was a guarantee\r\nnot of the weight but of the purity of the metal. In this case the metal\r\nmust have been used as a medium of exchange; as a medium of barter the\r\nweight would be sufficient. Mommsen’s opinion is (op. cit. p. 175) that\r\na regular copper coinage was not introduced at Rome until about the\r\nperiod of the _decemviri_ (450-430 _B.C._), and more recent numismatists\r\npronounce even this date to be too early.\r\n\r\n[282] Momms. _Staatsr._ iii. p. 247.\r\n\r\n[283] The existence of the guilds in regal times (Plut. _Num._ 17) rather\r\nproves than disproves the competing manufacture by slaves.\r\n\r\n[284] Cic. _pro Flacco_ 32, 80. See p. 66.\r\n\r\n[285] For this difference of armour see Liv. i. 43; Dionys. iv. 16, 17.\r\nIt survived into Polybius’ time (Polyb. vi. 23 ὁι δὲ ὑπὲρ τὰς μυρίας\r\nτιμώμενοι δραχμὰς ἀντὶ τοῦ καρδιοφύλακος σὺν τοῖς ἄλλοις ἁλυσιδωτοὺς\r\nπεριτίθενται θώρακας).\r\n\r\n[286] Gellius vi. (vii.) 13 “‘Classici’ dicebantur non omnes, qui in\r\nquinque classibus erant, sed primae tantum classis homines, qui centum et\r\nviginti quinque milia aeris ampliusve censi erant. ‘Infra classem’ autem\r\nappellabantur secundae classis ceterarumque omnium classium, qui minore\r\nsumma aeris, quod supra dixi, censebantur”; Festus p. 113 “infra classem\r\nsignificantur qui minore summa quam centum et viginti milium aeris censi\r\nsunt.”\r\n\r\nBelot (_Hist. d. Chev. Rom._ i. 204, 205) thinks that the 125,000 asses\r\nmentioned here was the figure of the lowest census—the fifth class—at\r\nthe time of the _lex Voconia_ (169 B.C.), mentioned in this connexion by\r\nFestus. The designation in asses was still kept, but the _as_ must now\r\nbe multiplied by 10 (12,500 × 10 = 125,000 asses). Belot starts from his\r\nhypothesis that the _as_ of the census is the old libral _as_. See the\r\ntables on the next page. Mommsen (_Staatsr._ iii. p. 249 n. 4), on the\r\nother hand, supposes that the law referred to the census of the first\r\nclass, and that it was through an interpretation meant to limit its\r\noperation, when the value of money had altered, expressed in terms of the\r\n_centum milia aeris_ of libral asses. That it was so interpreted is shown\r\nby the fact that the _centum milia aeris_ of the Voconian law (Gaius ii.\r\n274) became _centum milia sestertium_ (Schol. to Cic. _Verr._ ii. 1, 41,\r\n104, p. 188 Orell.), i.e. 25,000 denarii (Dio Cass. lvi. 10).\r\n\r\n[287] Plut. (_Num._ 17) mentions τέκτονες and χαλκεῖς amongst the\r\n_collegia_ (Momms. _Staatsr._ iii. p. 287 n. 1).\r\n\r\n[288] So too Polybius (vi. 23, cited p. 70).\r\n\r\n[289] Plin. _H.N._ xxxiii. 3 “Maximus census CXX assium fuit illo\r\n(Servio) rege, et ideo haec prima classis.” Festus p. 113 (cited p. 70).\r\n\r\n[290] _Staatsrecht_ iii pp. 249, 250. Böckh (_Metrologische\r\nUntersuchungen_ p. 444) also takes the view of the asses being\r\n_sextantarii_. He makes the qualifications in terms of the libral _as_\r\nand the _as_ of two ounces respectively: 20,000 = 100,000, 15,000 =\r\n75,000, 10,000 = 50,000, 5000 = 25,000, 2000 = 10,000.\r\n\r\n[291] _Histoire des Chevaliers Romains_ (Table at commencement of vol. i).\r\n\r\n[292] Festus p. 18 “accensi dicebantur qui in locum mortuorum militum\r\nsubito subrogabantur, dicti ita, quia ad censum adiciebantur”; p. 369\r\n“velati appellabantur vestiti et inermes qui exercitum sequebantur,\r\nquique in mortuorum militum loco substituebantur.” Cf. p. 14\r\n“adscripticii veluti quidam scripti dicebantur, qui supplendis legionibus\r\nadscribebantur. Hos et accensos dicebant, quod ad legionum censum essent\r\nadscripti. Quidam velatos, quia vestiti inermes sequerentur exercitum.”\r\n\r\n[293] Liv. i. 43 “hoc minor census reliquam multitudinem habuit; inde\r\nuna centuria facta est immunis militia”; Dionys. iv. 18 (the remaining\r\ncitizens with a qualification under 12½ minae Servius placed in one\r\nλόχος) στρατείας τε ἀπέλυσε καὶ πάσης εἰσφορᾶς ἐποίησεν ἀτελεῖς. Cf. vii.\r\n59 οὖτοι στρατειῶν τε ἧσαν ἐλεύθεροι τῶν ἐκ καταλόγου καὶ εἰσφορῶν τῶν\r\nκατὰ τιμήματα γενομένων ἀτελεῖς καὶ δι’ ἄμφω ταῦτ’ ἐν ταῖς ψηφοφορίαις\r\nἀτιμότατοι. Cf. Cic. _de Rep._ ii. 22, 40 “in quo etiam verbis ac\r\nnominibus ipsis fuit diligens; qui, cum locupletes assiduos appellasset\r\nab asse dando, eos, qui aut non plus mille quingentos aeris aut omnino\r\nnihil in suum censum praeter caput attulissent, proletarios nominavit;\r\nut ex iis quasi proles, id est quasi progenies civitatis, exspectari\r\nvideretur. Illarum autem sex et nonaginta centuriarum in una centuria tum\r\nquidem plures censebantur, quam paene in prima classe tota.”\r\n\r\n[294] Ulpian in _Fragm. Vat._ 138 “ii qui in centuria accensorum\r\nvelatorum sunt, habent immunitatem a tutelis et curis.”\r\n\r\n[295] The word is not technical enough to be used as an argument that the\r\n_classes_ included only landholders. The favourite ancient derivation was\r\nfrom _ab asse dando_ (Cic. _de Rep._ ii. 22, 40, see p. 72), whether for\r\nthe payment of taxation or for the furnishing of military equipment.\r\n\r\n[296] _Capite censi_, if we trust Cicero (_de Rep._ ii. 22, 40, see p.\r\n72), came to mean those below 1500 asses (the subsequent limit to the\r\nincidence of taxation). The limit of census for military service was also\r\nreduced to 4000 asses (Polyb. vi. 19), and finally to 375 (Gell. xvi. 10,\r\n10), and those below this census continued to be called _capite censi_\r\n(Gell. l.c.; Sall. _Jug._ 86). _Aerarius_, on the other hand, seems to\r\nhave preserved its old meaning of those excluded from the centuries—Ps.\r\nAsc. in _Divin._ p. 103 “(Censores) prorsus cives sic notabant ... ut,\r\nqui plebeius (esset) ... aerarius fieret, ac per hoc non esset in albo\r\ncenturiae suae, sed ad hoc [non] esset civis, tantummodo ut pro capite\r\nsuo tributi nomine aera praeberet.”\r\n\r\n[297] p. 41.\r\n\r\n[298] It is not known when they ceased to be patrician; Mommsen\r\n(_Staatsr._ iii. p. 254) thinks on the reform of the Servian\r\nconstitution, _circa_ 220 B.C.\r\n\r\n[299] Liv. i. 36.\r\n\r\n[300] Cic. _de Rep._ ii. 22, 39.\r\n\r\n[301] Festus p. 221 “paribus equis, id est duobus, Romani utebantur\r\nin proelio, ut sudante altero transirent in siccum. Pararium aes\r\nappellabatur id, quod equitibus duplex pro binis equis dabatur.”\r\n\r\n[302] Liv. i. 43 “ita pedestri exercitu ornato distributoque equitum\r\nex primoribus civitatis duodecim scripsit centurias. Sex item alias\r\ncenturias ... sub isdem, quibus inauguratae erant, nominibus fecit:\r\nad equos emendos dena millia aeris ex publico data [i.e., as Livy\r\nunderstands it, 10,000 _asses sextantarii_ = 1000 denarii], et, quibus\r\nequos alerent, viduae adtributae, quae bina milia aeris in annos singulos\r\npenderent” [2000 asses = 200 denarii]. Cf. Gaius iv. 27.\r\n\r\n[303] The number of the century was here fixed, and not, as in the case\r\nof the _classici_, expansive.\r\n\r\n[304] Cf. Liv. i. 43 “neque eae tribus ad centuriarum distributionem\r\nnumerumque quicquam pertinuere.” There is no evidence, e.g., that each\r\ntribe furnished a certain number of centuries.\r\n\r\n[305] _Tributum_, however, cannot be derived from _tribus_ (as by Varro\r\nquoted p. 40). The parallel words _attribuere_, _contribuere_, _ultro\r\ntributa_, etc., seem to show that it means something added to, conferred\r\non, or collected for another.\r\n\r\n[306] p. 48.\r\n\r\n[307] As such it was in the Republic given for the censors. Cic. _de Leg.\r\nAgr._ ii. 11, 26 “majores de singulis magistratibus bis vos sententiam\r\nferre voluerunt; nam cum centuriata lex censoribus ferebatur, cum curiata\r\nceteris patriciis magistratibus, tum iterum de eisdem judicabatur.”\r\n\r\n[308] p. 43.\r\n\r\n[309] p. 63.\r\n\r\n[310] p. 60.\r\n\r\n[311] Liv. i. 48 “id ipsum tam mite ac tam moderatum imperium tamen, quia\r\nunius esset, deponere eum in animo habuisse quidam auctores sunt, ni\r\nscelus intestinum liberandae patriae consilia agitanti intervenisset.”\r\n\r\n[312] ib. 49.\r\n\r\n[313] Cic. _de Rep._ ii. 22, 44.\r\n\r\n[314] Cic. _de Rep._ ii. 30, 52; Liv. ii. 1; App. _B.C._ ii. 119. It is\r\nsometimes represented as a law which made any one who aimed at royalty\r\n_sacer_ (Liv. ii. 8). For the dual sanction of the oath and the law\r\ncompare the means by which the _sacrosanctitas_ of the tribunes was\r\nsecured (p. 100).\r\n\r\n[315] It is strange that the _interregnum_, which would have secured a\r\ncontinuity, is not mentioned in this case. The election of the first\r\nconsuls was supposed to have been conducted by the _praefectus urbi_,\r\nwho almost certainly had not the _jus rogandi_ (p. 61). Liv. i. 60 “duo\r\nconsules inde comitiis centuriatis a praefecto urbis ex commentariis\r\nServii Tullii creati sunt, L. Junius Brutus et L. Tarquinius Collatinus.”\r\n\r\n[316] For the title _praetores_ see Cic. _de Leg._ iii. 3, 8 “regio\r\nimperio duo sunto iique a praeeundo judicando consulendo praetores\r\njudices consules appellamino”; for that of _judices_, Varro _L.L._ vi.\r\n88, who quotes from the _commentarii consulares_ the formula used in\r\nsummoning the _comitia centuriata_, “qui exercitum imperaturus erit,\r\naccenso dicito: ‘C. Calpurni, voca in licium omnes Quirites huc ad me.’\r\nAccensus dicito sic ‘Omnes Quirites in licium visite huc ad judices.’\r\n‘C. Calpurni,’ consul dicito, ‘voca ad conventionem omnes Quirites huc\r\nad me.’ Accensus dicito sic ‘Omnes Quirites ite ad conventionem huc ad\r\njudices.’”\r\n\r\n[317] See the section on the magistracy (p. 187).\r\n\r\n[318] This ratification indeed remained. Even though elections were\r\nconducted before the centuries, a _lex_ was still passed by the _curiae_\r\nratifying this election (p. 49); and the _patrum auctoritas_ was still\r\nrequired to sanction each fresh appointment.\r\n\r\n[319] If it existed before it could have been only in the priestly\r\ncolleges, but these seem rather advising bodies to the king.\r\n\r\n[320] From _con-salio_, i.e. people who leap or dance together,\r\n“partners” (in a dance). Momms. _Staatsr._ ii. p. 77 n. 3; he compares\r\n_praesul_ and _exul_.\r\n\r\n[321] Liv. ii. 8 (509 B.C.) “Latae deinde leges ... ante omnes de\r\nprovocatione adversus magistratus ad populum”; Cic. _de Rep._ i. 40, 62\r\n“Vides ... Tarquinio exacto, mira quadam exsultare populum insolentia\r\nlibertatis; tum annui consules, tum demissi populo fasces, tum\r\nprovocationes omnium rerum” (i.e. the _provocatio_ became _universal_\r\ninstead of being confined to certain _spheres_).\r\n\r\n[322] By this time the direct capital jurisdiction of the pontiffs had\r\nprobably become extinct.\r\n\r\n[323] Liv. iii. 20 “neque provocationem esse longius ab urbe mille\r\npassuum, et tribunos si eo (lake Regillus) veniant, in alia turba\r\nQuiritium subjectos fore consulari imperio.” But the question between the\r\n_pomerium_ and the first milestone was in later times still a disputed\r\none (Liv. xxiv. 9).\r\n\r\n[324] Cic. l.c.\r\n\r\n[325] p. 63.\r\n\r\n[326] The _quaestores parricidii_ and _aerarii_ are identified by Zonaras\r\n(vii. 13), following Dio. See p. 63. They were called _quaestores_,\r\nοἵ πρῶτον μὲν τὰς θανασίμους δίκας ἔδίκαζον (whence their title),\r\nὕστερον δὲ καὶ τὴν κοινῶν χρημάτων διοίκησιν ἔλαχον. So Varro (_L.L._\r\nv. 81), “quaestores a quaerendo, qui conquirerent publicas pecunias et\r\nmaleficia.” The identity of the two offices is denied by Pomponius in\r\n_Dig._ 1, 2, 2, 22 and 23.\r\n\r\n[327] _Quaestores parricidii_ were mentioned in the Twelve Tables\r\n(Pompon. in _Dig._ 1, 2, 2, 23).\r\n\r\n[328] Liv. i. 26.\r\n\r\n[329] They are mentioned in the trial of M. Volscius (459 B.C.) for an\r\nordinary criminal offence (Liv. iii. 24), but also in the public trials\r\nof Sp. Cassius in 485 B.C. (Liv. ii. 41; Cic. _de Rep._ ii. 35, 60), and\r\nof Camillus in 396 B.C. (Plin. _H.N._ xxxiv. 3, 13); but various accounts\r\nare given of the procedure in these two trials.\r\n\r\n[330] Plut. _Public._ 12 ταμιεῖον μὲν ἀπέδειξε τὸν τοῦ Κρόνου ναόν ...\r\nταμίας δὲ τῳ δήμῳ δύο τῶν νέων ἔδωκεν ἀποδεῖξαι. The first quaestors\r\nappointed were Publius Veturius and Marcus Minucius. Pomponius (p. 80)\r\nputs the creation of the financial quaestors after the first secession of\r\nthe Plebs; Lydus (_de Mag._ i. 38) attributes them to the Licinian law of\r\n367.\r\n\r\n[331] Tac. _Ann._ xi. 22 “Sed quaestores regibus etiam tum imperantibus\r\ninstituti sunt, quod lex curiata ostendit ab L. Bruto repetita. Mansitque\r\nconsulibus potestas deligendi, donec eum quoque honorem populus mandaret.\r\nCreatique primum Valerius Potitus et Aemilius Mamercus sexagesimo tertio\r\nanno post Tarquinios exactos, ut rem militarem comitarentur” (i.e. 447\r\nB.C.; hence Mommsen, _Staatsr._ ii. p. 529, thinks the change was due\r\nto the Valerio-Horatian laws of 449 B.C.). Plutarch (see note 1) thinks\r\nthey were elected from the first. The meaning of the passage of Tacitus\r\nseems to be that the king nominated his quaestors after his own election,\r\nand their appointment was then ratified by the _lex curiata_. Another\r\nexplanation is that the _lex_ recited that the kings had appointed\r\nquaestors and empowered the consuls to do so. Cf. Ulpian in _Dig._ 1, 13.\r\n\r\n[332] Festus p. 246, cited p. 59.\r\n\r\n[333] Zonaras (vii. 9) makes Servius Tullius introduce Plebeians into the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\n[334] Liv. ii. 1 “Deinde, quo plus virium in senatu frequentia etiam\r\nordinis faceret, caedibus regis diminutum patrum numerum primoribus\r\nequestris gradus lectis ad trecentorum summam explevit: traditumque inde\r\nfertur, ut in senatum vocarentur qui patres quique conscripti essent:\r\nconscriptos videlicet in novum senatum appellabant lectos”; Festus p.\r\n254 “‘Qui patres, qui conscripti’: vocati sunt in curiam, quo tempore\r\nregibus urbe expulsis P. Valerius consul propter inopiam patriciorum\r\nex plebe adlegit in numerum senatorum C. et LX. et IIII. ut expleret\r\nnumerum senatorum trecentorum” (for these numbers cf. Plut. _Public._\r\n11 τοὺς δ’ ἐγγραφέντας ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ λέγουσιν ἑκατὸν καὶ ἑξήκοντα τέσσαρας\r\nγενέσθαι). So _adlecti_, Festus p. 7 “_adlecti_ dicebantur apud Romanos,\r\nqui propter inopiam ex equestri ordine in senatorum sunt numero adsumpti:\r\nnam patres dicuntur qui sunt patricii generis, conscripti qui in senatu\r\nsunt scriptis adnotati.” Plutarch (_Qu. Rom._ 58, _Rom._ 13) makes the\r\nadded members Plebeians. Tacitus (_Ann._ xi. 25) wrongly identifies these\r\nadded members with the _minores gentes_. (Claudius creates Patricians\r\nA.D. 48—“paucis jam reliquis familiis, quas Romulus majorum et L. Brutus\r\nminorum gentium appellaverant.”)\r\n\r\n[335] Willems (_Le Sénat_ ii. 39 ff.) makes _patres conscripti_ simply\r\nequivalent to “assembled fathers.”\r\n\r\n[336] The first clear instance of a plebeian senator dates from the\r\nyear 401. Liv. v. 12. P. Licinius Calvus, created military tribune with\r\nconsular power, was “vir nullis ante honoribus usus, vetus tantum senator\r\net aetate jam gravis.” Cf. Liv. iv. 15. Of Sp. Maelius (439 B.C.) it is\r\nasked “quem senatorem concoquere civitas vix posset, regem ferret.”\r\n\r\n[337] p. 60.\r\n\r\n[338] Liv. ii. 18; Festus p. 198; Pompon. in _Dig._ 1, 2, 2, 18.\r\n\r\n[339] The title was, perhaps, originally _praetor_. This would naturally\r\nhave been the case if Mommsen’s theory is right that they were regarded\r\nas superior colleagues of the consuls (_Staatsr._ ii. p. 153). The\r\nearliest official title known to us is _magister populi_, and it was the\r\ntechnical title in the augural books. Cic. _de Leg._ iii. 3, 9 “isque\r\nave sinistra dictus populi magister esto.” Cf. _de Rep._ i. 40, 63\r\n“Gravioribus vero bellis etiam sine collega omne imperium nostri penes\r\nsingulos esse voluerunt, quorum ipsum nomen vim suae potestatis indicat.\r\nNam dictator quidem ab eo appellatur quia dicitur; sed in nostris\r\nlibris vides eum, Laeli, magistrum populi appellari.” The later title,\r\n_dictator_, was perhaps adopted in deference to Republican sentiment;\r\nMommsen (_Staatsr._ ii. p. 145) conjectures, in imitation of the Latin\r\ndictator, a constitutional survival of the monarchy. The meaning of the\r\nword is wholly uncertain. Ancient guesses say (i.) from _dicitur_ (Cic.\r\n_de Rep._ l.c.); (ii) from _dicto audiens_ (Varro _L.L._ v. 81 “quoi\r\ndicto audientes omnes essent”); (iii.) from _dictare_ (Priscian viii. 14,\r\n78), or (iv.) because they issued edicts (Dionys. v. 73).\r\n\r\n[340] Pompon. in _Dig._ 1, 2, 2, 19 “Et his dictatoribus magistri equitum\r\ninjungebantur sic, quo modo regibus tribuni celerum: quod officium\r\nfere tale erat, quale hodie praefectorum praetorio, magistratus tamen\r\nhabebantur legitimi.”\r\n\r\n[341] Cic. _de Leg._ iii. 3, 9 “Ast quando duellum gravius, discordiae\r\ncivium escunt, oenus, ne amplius sex menses, si senatus creverit, idem\r\njuris, quod duo consules, teneto”; Imp. Claudius _Oratio_ i. 28 “Quid\r\nnunc commemorem dictaturae hoc ipso consulari imperium valentius repertum\r\napud majores nostros quo in asperioribus bellis aut in civili motu\r\ndifficiliore uterentur?”\r\n\r\n[342] Cicero (_de Rep._ ii. 31, 53) gives as the tenor of the first\r\nValerian law “ne quis magistratus civem Romanum adversus provocationem\r\nnecaret neve verberaret.” Dionysius (v. 19) adds ζημιοῦν εἰς χρήματα to\r\nἀποκτείνειν ἢ μαστιγοῦν, and Plutarch (_Publ._ 11) seems to give it the\r\nsame wide scope. He also thinks that Valerius fixed the _multa suprema_\r\n(l.c.), i.e. the largest fine the magistrate could impose without appeal.\r\nThese statements may, however, be deductions from the later _provocatio_.\r\n\r\n[343] Pompon. in _Dig._ 1, 2, 2 (§ 3) “exactis deinde regibus ... omnes\r\nleges hae exoleverunt iterumque coepit populus Romanus incerto magis jure\r\net consuetudine aliqua uti quam per latam legem, idque prope quinquaginta\r\n(MSS. “viginti”) annis passus est.” After the Twelve Tables (§ 6) “ex\r\nhis legibus ... actiones compositae sunt, quibus inter se homines\r\ndisceptarent: quas actiones ne populus prout vellet institueret, certas\r\nsollemnesque esse voluerunt ... Omnium tamen harum et interpretandi\r\nscientia et actiones apud collegium pontificum erant, ex quibus\r\nconstituebatur, quis quoquo anno praeesset privatis.”\r\n\r\n[344] p. 64.\r\n\r\n[345] The later praetorian interdicts (_de locis sacris_, _de mortuo\r\ninferendo_) are really within the domain of _fas_ and must at one time\r\nhave been enforced by the pontiffs.\r\n\r\n[346] p. 78.\r\n\r\n[347] Mommsen _Staatsr._ iii. p. 93.\r\n\r\n[348] p. 35.\r\n\r\n[349] The privilege could not have been based on quiritarian ownership,\r\nsince this tenure was precarious.\r\n\r\n[350] The contract of _nexum_ was in fact a conditioned mancipation,\r\nlike a testament, the _nuncupatio_ being made by the vendor, who\r\nperhaps purchased with a single coin (_nummo uno_), as in the later\r\n_mancipationes fiduciae causa_ (Bruns _Fontes_).\r\n\r\n[351] Except as a penal measure ordained by the state. The _furem\r\nmanifestum_ according to Gellius (xx. 1), “in servitutem tradit” (lex);\r\nhe is more correctly described as _addictus_ by Gaius (iii. 189). The\r\n_incensus_ might be sold as a slave (Cic. _pro. Caecin._ 34, 99). Later a\r\nfree man who collusively allowed himself to be sold as a slave, in order\r\nto share the purchase money with the vendor, was adjudged a slave as a\r\npunishment for his fraud (_Dig._ 40, 13, 3; _Inst._ 1, 3, 4; _Cod._ 7,\r\n18, 1).\r\n\r\n[352] p. 24.\r\n\r\n[353] Gell. xx. 1 “Aeris confessi rebusque jure judicatis triginta\r\ndies justi sunto. Post deinde manus injectio esto, in jus ducito. Ni\r\njudicatum facit aut quis endo eo in jure vindicit, secum ducito, vincito\r\naut nervo aut compedibus.... Si volet suo vivito. Ni suo vivit, qui eum\r\nvinctum habebit, libras farris endo dies dato. Si volet plus dato.” The\r\n_addictus_ like the _nexus_ did not become a slave, but still retained\r\nhis position in his census and in his tribe (Quinctil. _Decl._ 311).\r\n\r\n[354] In the case of a nexal contract there could not be more creditors\r\nthan one. A man could not, by the nature of the case, mancipate himself\r\nto several people at once.\r\n\r\n[355] Liv. ii. 23 “Fremebant se, foris pro libertate et imperio\r\ndimicantes, domi a civibus captos et oppressos esse; tutioremque in bello\r\nquam in pace, et inter hostes quam inter cives, libertatem plebis esse.”\r\n\r\n[356] ib. 27.\r\n\r\n[357] Dionys. vi. 45.\r\n\r\n[358] Liv. ii. 28. The senators complain “nunc in mille curias\r\ncontionesque (cum alia in Esquiliis, alia in Aventino fiant concilia)\r\ndispersam et dissipatam esse rem publicam.”\r\n\r\n[359] Varro _L.L._ v. 81 “tribuni plebei, quod ex tribunis militum primum\r\ntribuni plebei facti, qui plebem defenderent, in secessione Crustumerina.”\r\n\r\n[360] The principle of cooptation was said to have been recognised in the\r\n_carmen rogationis_ of the tribunate, and in this case it was held that\r\nPatricians were eligible. Liv. iii. 65 (449 B.C.) “Novi tribuni plebis\r\nin cooptandis collegis patrum voluntatem foverunt. Duos etiam patricios\r\nconsularesque, Sp. Tarpeium et A. Aternium, cooptavere.” But, with the\r\ndisuse of this principle, the plebeian qualification was observed.\r\n\r\n[361] Cic. ap. Ascon. _in Cornel._ p. 76 “Tanta igitur in illis virtus\r\nfuit, ut anno xvi. post reges exactos propter nimiam dominationem\r\npotentium secederent, ... duos tribunos crearent.... Itaque auspicato\r\npostero anno tr. pl. comitiis curiatis creati sunt,” (For the number\r\ntwo Ascon. _in loc._ quotes Tuditanus and Atticus.) Cicero apparently\r\nunderstands by this the mixed assembly of the _curiae_; and so does Livy\r\n(ii. 56, on the _lex Publilia_ transferring the elections of the tribunes\r\nto the tribes), “quae patriciis omnem potestatem per clientium suffragia\r\ncreandi, quos vellent, tribunos auferret.”\r\n\r\n[362] It must have been so restricted at first. Later (as we shall see in\r\ndealing with the intercession) the _auxilium_ was extended to the whole\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n[363] Cic. _de Rep._ ii. 33, 58 “contra consulare imperium tribuni plebis\r\n... constituti.”\r\n\r\n[364] Gell. xiii. 12 “(tribunis) jus abnoctandi ademptum, quoniam, ut vim\r\nfieri vetarent, adsiduitate eorum et praesentium oculis opus erat.” Cf.\r\niii. 2. Plut. _Qu. Rom._ 81 ὅθεν οὐδ’ οἰκίας αὐτοῦ κλείεσθαι νενόμισται\r\nθύραν, ἀλλὰ καὶ νύκτωρ ἀνέῳγε καὶ μεθ’ ἡμέραν, ὤσπερ λιμὴν καὶ καταφυγὴ\r\nτοῖς δεομένοις.\r\n\r\n[365] For the increase to four see Diodor. xi. 68 (471 B.C. in connexion\r\nwith the _lex Publilia_); other accounts represent the original number as\r\nfive (Ascon. l.c. p. 93, and Livy ii. 33; two elected, three coopted; cf.\r\nnote on p. 93). The increase to ten is assigned by Livy and Dionysius to\r\n457 B.C. (Livy iii. 30; the tribunes allowed the levy “non sine pactione\r\ntamen ut ... decem deinde tribuni plebis crearentur. Expressit hoc\r\nnecessitas patribus”; cf. Dionys. x. 30).\r\n\r\n[366] Liv. ii. 35 “contemptim primo Marcius audiebat minas tribunicias;\r\nauxilii, non poenae, jus datum illi potestati; plebisque, non patrum,\r\ntribunos esse.” Coriolanus was probably impeached before the Plebs as a\r\n_hostis tribuniciae potestatis_ in consequence of his advice that the\r\ntribunate should be abrogated (Liv. ii. 34). See Rein _Criminalrecht_\r\np. 484. Cf. Liv. ii. 56 (471 B.C.; the tribune seizes some _nobiles_\r\nwho would not yield to his _viator_) “Consul Appius negare jus esse\r\ntribuno in quemquam, nisi in plebeium; non enim populi, sed plebis, eum\r\nmagistratum esse.”\r\n\r\n[367] Dionys. vii. 17 δημάρχου γνώμην ἀγορεύοντος ἐν δήμῳ μηδεὶς λεγέτω\r\nμηδὲν ἐναντίον μηδὲ μεσολαβείτω τὸν λόγον. ἐὰν δὲ τις παρὰ ταῦτα ποιὴσῃ,\r\nδιδότω τοῖς δημάρχοις ἐγγυητὰς αἰτηθεὶς εἰς ἔκτισιν ἧς ἂν ἐποθῶσιν αὐτῷ\r\nζημίας. Any one who does not give securities (ἐγγυηταί) is to be punished\r\nwith death καὶ τὰ χρήματ’ αὐτοῦ ἱερὰ ἔστω. τῶν δ’ ἀμφισβητούντων πρὸς\r\nταύτας τὰς ζημίας αἱ κρίσεις ἔστωσαν ἐπὶ τοῦ δήμου. Cf. vi. 16, and\r\nCic. _pro Sest._ 37, 79 “Fretus sanctitate tribunatus, cum se non modo\r\ncontra vim et ferrum, sed etiam contra verba atque interfationem legibus\r\nsacratis esse armatum putaret.”\r\n\r\n[368] p. 66 note 5.\r\n\r\n[369] Dionys. x. 31, 32; see Mr. Strachan-Davidson in Smith _Dict. of\r\nAntiq._ s.v. _plebiscitum_.\r\n\r\n[370] p. 39.\r\n\r\n[371] Dionys. vi. 90 ἄνδρας ἐκ τῶν δημοτικῶν δύο καθ’ ἕκαστον ἐνιαυτὸν\r\nἀποδεικνύναι τοὺς ὑπηρετήσοντας τοῖς δημάρχοις ὅσων ἂν δέωνται καὶ δίκας,\r\nἅς ἂν ἐπιτρέψωνται ἐκεῖνοι, κρινοῦντας ἱερῶν τε καὶ δημοσίων τόπων καὶ\r\nτῆς κατὰ τὴν ἀγορὰν ἐυετηρίας ἐπιμελησομένους: Gell. xvii. 21 “tribunos\r\net aediles tum primum per seditionem sibi plebes creavit”; Pompon. in\r\n_Dig._ 1, 2, 2, 21 “Itemque ut essent qui aedibus praeessent, in quibus\r\nomnia scita sua plebs deferebat, duos ex plebe constituerunt, qui etiam\r\naediles appellati sunt.”\r\n\r\n[372] Dionysius (l.c.) suggests that they originally bore another title.\r\nPomponius (l.c.) derives the name from their office in the temple of\r\nCeres; Varro from their care of the repair of _aedes_ both sacred and\r\nprivate (Varro _L.L._ v. 81 “aedilis, qui aedes sacras et privatas\r\nprocuraret”), a derivation which Mommsen (_Staatsr._ ii. p. 480) favours.\r\nTheir relation to the aediles of the Latin towns is wholly uncertain.\r\nMommsen (ib. p. 474) holds strongly to the view that the Latin aedileship\r\nwas borrowed from the Roman. For a different view cf. Ohnesseit _Ztschr.\r\nder Savigny-stiftung_ 1883, pp. 200 sq.\r\n\r\n[373] Plut. _Coriol._ 18 (the tribune Sicinnius) προσέταξε τοῖς\r\nἀγορανόμοις ἀναγαγόντας αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὴν ἄκραν εὐθὺς ὦσαι κατὰ τῆς\r\nὑποκειμένης φάραγγος. So later in the trial of P. Scipio. Liv. xxix. 20;\r\nxxxviii. 52.\r\n\r\n[374] Liv. iii. 31 (456 B.C.; the consuls sell booty taken from the\r\nAequi) “itaque ergo, ut magistratu abiere ... dies dicta est, Romilio ab\r\nC. Calvio Cicerone, tribuno plebis, Veturio ab L. Alieno, aedile plebis.”\r\n\r\n[375] Yet Livy attributes both to the fifth century; they perform\r\npolice-duties in the year 463 (Liv. iii. 6), and are entrusted with the\r\ncare of the state religion in 428 (Liv. iv. 30).\r\n\r\n[376] Livy, however (iii. 55, cited note 2), represents the\r\n_sacrosanctitas_ of the aediles as being based only on law.\r\n\r\n[377] Dionys. vi. 89. The _sacrosanctitas_ of the tribune is guaranteed\r\nνόμῳ τε καὶ ὅρκῳ. Cf. App. _B.C._ ii. 108 ἡ τῶν δημάρχων ἀρχὴ ἱερὰ\r\nκαὶ ἄσυλος ἦν ἐκ νόμου καὶ ὅρκου παλαιοῦ. For these two grounds of\r\ninviolability see Liv. iii. 55 (restoration of tribunate in 449) “et cum\r\nreligione inviolatos eos, tum lege etiam fecerunt, sanciendo ‘ut qui\r\ntribunis plebis, aedilibus, judicibus, decemviris nocuisset, ejus caput\r\nJovi sacrum esset, familia ad aedem Cereris, Liberi Liberaeque venum\r\niret.’ Hac lege juris interpretes negant quemquam sacrosanctum esse; sed\r\neum, qui eorum cuiquam nocuerit, sacrum sanciri. Itaque aedilem prendi\r\nducique a majoribus magistratibus: quod etsi non jure fiat (noceri enim\r\nei, cui hac lege non liceat) tamen argumentum esse, non haberi pro sacro\r\nsanctoque aedilem: tribunos vetere jurejurando plebis, cum primum eam\r\npotestatem creavit, sacrosanctos esse” (cf. Liv. ii. 33 “sacratam legem\r\nlatam” on the Mons Sacer).\r\n\r\n[378] Resistance to the will of a _magistratus populi_ is not\r\n_perduellio_ in later Roman law, but rather _vis_. But resistance to the\r\ntribune is always _majestas_.\r\n\r\n[379] Dionys. vii. 17. See p. 96.\r\n\r\n[380] Liv. ii 56 (Publilius Volero) “rogationem tulit ad populum, ut\r\nplebei magistratus tributis comitiis fierent” (followed by the words\r\ncited on p. 94).\r\n\r\n[381] This is Livy’s view (l.c.), “nec, quae una vis ad resistendum erat,\r\nut intercederet aliquis ex collegio ... adduci posset.”\r\n\r\n[382] The ground of objection given by Livy (ii. 56, cited p. 94) rests\r\non the belief that the tribunes had been formerly elected by the _comitia\r\ncuriata_.\r\n\r\n[383] Aemilia, [Camilia], Claudia, Cornelia, Fabia, [Galeria], Horatia,\r\n[Lemonia], Menenia, Papiria, [Pollia], [Pupinia], Romulia or Romilia,\r\nSergia, [Voltinia], Voturia or Veturia (from Momms. _Staatsr._ iii. p.\r\n168; the names he encloses in brackets are those to which there are no\r\nextant patrician _gentes_ to correspond).\r\n\r\n[384] Dionys. vii. 64.\r\n\r\n[385] Momms. _Staatsr._ iii. p. 153.\r\n\r\n[386] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[387] Livy (iii. 9) says, “ut vviri creentur legibus de imperio consulari\r\nscribendis.” Even if this expression is due to a misunderstanding of the\r\ntitle of the decemvirs, “consulari imperio legibus scribendis” (Momms.\r\n_Staatsr._ ii. p. 702), it no doubt expresses a fact. For the nature\r\nand object of the decemvirate see Pompon. in _Dig._ 1, 2, 2, 4 (of the\r\nappointment of the decemvirs) “datumque est eis jus eo anno in civitate\r\nsummum, uti leges et corrigerent, si opus esset, et interpretarentur\r\nneque provocatio ab eis sicut a reliquis magistratibus fieret”; ib. (of\r\nthe publication of the laws) “quas in tabulas eboreas perscriptas pro\r\nrostris composuerunt, ut possint leges apertius percipi.” Cf. Dionys. x.\r\n1, 60.\r\n\r\n[388] Livy (iii. 11, 26, and 29) seems to speak of the law not being\r\nallowed to pass the Plebs; but then he does not recognise the two stages\r\nof legislation. See p. 97.\r\n\r\n[389] Liv. iii. 31.\r\n\r\n[390] ib. 33; cf. Momms. _Staatsr._ ii. p. 714.\r\n\r\n[391] Liv. iii. 32 “postremo concessum patribus, modo ne lex Icilia de\r\nAventino, aliaeque sacratae leges abrogarentur.” As to the _sacratae\r\nleges_, the aedileship would have gone with the tribunate; and there was\r\nnothing more to be protected by the _leges sacratae_.\r\n\r\n[392] Their title was _Decemviri consulari imperio legibus scribendis_\r\n(Capitoline Fasti). Cf. Liv. iii. 32 (“placet creari xviros sine\r\nprovocatione, et ne quis eo anno alius magistratus esset”) and Pompon. in\r\n_Dig._ (cited p. 102).\r\n\r\n[393] Liv. iii. 34 “se ... omnibus, summis infimisque jura aequasse.”\r\n\r\n[394] Dionys. x. 58; Liv. iii. 35.\r\n\r\n[395] Liv. iii. 57. The accounts of the material of the “Tables” vary.\r\nLivy (l.c.) says “in aes incisas in publico proposuerunt”; Pomponius (in\r\n_Dig._, cited p. 102) says “in tabulas eboreas perscriptas” (perhaps\r\n_roboreas_ or _aereas_, Kipp, _Quellenkunde des R.R._ p. 8). It is\r\npossible that they were of wood.\r\n\r\n[396] Liv. iii. 34 “fons omnis publici privatique est juris”; Tac. _Ann._\r\niii. 27 “creatique decemviri et accitis quae usquam egregia compositae\r\nduodecim tabulae, finis aequi juris.”\r\n\r\n[397] Cic. _de Leg._ ii. 23, 59 “Discebamus enim pueri XII, ut carmen\r\nnecessarium; quas jam nemo discit.”\r\n\r\n[398] Liv. iii. 34.\r\n\r\n[399] p. 19.\r\n\r\n[400] Ulpian _Reg._ ii. 4.\r\n\r\n[401] p. 10.\r\n\r\n[402] p. 91.\r\n\r\n[403] Cato _R.R._ praef.\r\n\r\n[404] Plin. _H.N._ xviii. 3, 12.\r\n\r\n[405] Cic. _de Rep._ iv. 12.\r\n\r\n[406] Gell. xx. 1.\r\n\r\n[407] Marcian in _Dig._ 48, 4, 3 “Lex duodecim tabularum jubet eum, qui\r\nhostem concitaverit quive civem hosti tradiderit, capite puniri.”\r\n\r\n[408] Pompon. in _Dig._ 1, 2, 2, 23. See p. 80.\r\n\r\n[409] Cic. _de Rep._ ii. 31, 54 “ab omni judicio poenaque provocari\r\nlicere indicant XII Tabulae compluribus legibus.”\r\n\r\n[410] Cic. _de Leg._ iii. 4, 11.\r\n\r\n[411] _Decl. in Catil._ 19.\r\n\r\n[412] This rule is said to have been taken from a law of Solon’s (Gaius\r\nin _Dig._ 47, 22, 4). Other traces of Greek influence are perhaps to be\r\nfound in the sumptuary regulations, especially those about funerals, and\r\nperhaps in the prohibition of interment within the city. Gaius finds also\r\na Solonian parallel to the _actio finium regundorum_ ordained by the law\r\n(_Dig._ 10, 1, 13).\r\n\r\n[413] Liv. vii. 17 “in duodecim tabulis legem esse, ut quodcumque\r\npostremum populus jussisset, id jus ratumque esset.”\r\n\r\n[414] Liv. iii. 53.\r\n\r\n[415] ib. 54 “ibi extemplo, pontifice maximo comitia habente, tribunos\r\nplebis creaverunt.”\r\n\r\n[416] ib. “Confestim de consulibus creandis cum provocatione M. Duilius\r\nrogationem pertulit.” Such a resolution would not need confirmation by\r\nthe people, as, after the fall of the decemvirs, an _interregnum_ would\r\nnaturally ensue; and this was a matter for the Senate. But Livy also\r\nrepresents the tribune as (in accordance with a _senatus consultum_)\r\npassing the act of amnesty, iii. 54 “Tribunatu inito, L. Icilius extemplo\r\nplebem rogavit, et plebs scivit, ne cui fraudi esset secessio ab\r\ndecemviris facta.” In later Roman law amnesty resides with the Senate.\r\n\r\n[417] Liv. iii. 55 “ne quis ullum magistratum sine provocatione crearet,\r\nqui creasset, eum jus fasque esset occidi: neve ea caedes capitalis noxae\r\nhaberetur.”\r\n\r\n[418] p. 79.\r\n\r\n[419] p. 79.\r\n\r\n[420] p. 99.\r\n\r\n[421] Liv. iii. 55 “omnium primum, cum velut in controverso jure esset,\r\ntenerenturne patres plebiscitis, legem centuriatis comitiis tulere ‘ut\r\nquod,’” etc. Cf. Dionys. xi. 45.\r\n\r\n[422] Mr. Strachan-Davidson in Smith _Dict. of Antiq._ s.v.\r\n_plebiscitum_, and _English Historical Review_ Nos. 2 and 19.\r\n\r\n[423] p. 97.\r\n\r\n[424] p. 107.\r\n\r\n[425] Types of such laws between 449 and 287 B.C. are the _lex\r\nTerentilia_ (462), _Canuleia_ (445), _Licinia_ (367), _Ogulnia_ (300).\r\n\r\n[426] Liv. iii. 55 “M. Duilius deinde tribunus plebis plebem rogavit,\r\nplebesque scivit: ‘qui plebem sine tribunis reliquisset, quique\r\nmagistratum sine provocatione creasset, tergo ac capita puniretur.’”\r\n\r\n[427] Liv. iv. 1 “de conubio patrum et plebis C. Canuleius tribunus\r\nplebis rogationem promulgavit.”\r\n\r\n[428] See p. 39 and cf. Liv. iv. 6; the consuls (in a _contio_) gave\r\nas the official reason “quod nemo plebeius auspicia haberet; ideoque\r\ndecemviros conubium diremisse, ne incerta prole auspicia turbarentur.”\r\n\r\n[429] Liv. iv. 1 “et mentio, primo sensim inlata a tribunis, ut alterum\r\nex plebe consulem liceret fieri, eo processit deinde, ut rogationem novem\r\ntribuni promulgarent, ‘ut populo potestas esset, seu de plebe, seu de\r\npatribus vellet, consules faciendi.’”\r\n\r\n[430] The situation at the beginning of the year thus is described by\r\nLivy (iv. 2), “eodem tempore et consules senatum in tribunum, et tribunus\r\npopulum in consules incitabat.” At last (Liv. iv. 6) “victi tandem\r\npatres, ut de conubio ferretur, consensere.”\r\n\r\n[431] Liv. iv. 6.\r\n\r\n[432] ib. 35.\r\n\r\n[433] Claudius in _Tab. Lugd._ “quid (commemorem) in pluris distributum\r\nconsulare imperium tribunosque militum consulari imperio appellatos, qui\r\nseni et saepe octoni crearentur.”\r\n\r\n[434] Livy sometimes speaks of eight (v. 1, vi. 27); cf. _Tab. Lugd._\r\ncited note 3. It is probable that this number includes the six tribunes\r\nand the two censors (Momms. _Staatsr._ ii. p. 184); e.g. Livy gives\r\neight for the year 403, the Fasti Capitol. for the same year (351 A.U.C.\r\n_C.I.L._ i. p. 428) six and two censors.\r\n\r\n[435] Pompon. in _Dig._ 1, 2, 2, 25 “cum ... plebs contenderet cum\r\npatribus et vellet ex suo quoque corpora consules creare, et patres\r\nrecusarent, factum est ut tribuni militum crearentur partim ex plebe,\r\npartim ex patribus consulari potestate.”\r\n\r\n[436] Liv. v. 12. This is maintained to be an error by Mommsen, _Röm.\r\nForsch._ i. 66; _Staatsr._ ii. p. 188. He holds that in 445 B.C. one L.\r\nAtilius Longus was a Plebeian, and that in 400, 399, 396 the Plebeians\r\nhad a majority. Livy’s view is upheld by Willems _Le Sénat_ i. 58-60.\r\n\r\n[437] If it be taken to prove that the preponderance of voting power in\r\nthe _comitia centuriata_ was still on the side of the Patricians, it\r\nwould throw a valuable side-light on the relative economic position of\r\nthe two orders.\r\n\r\n[438] _Imperium_ (_Tab. Lugd._ quoted p. 112); _potestas_ (Liv. iv. 6);\r\n_jus_ (Tac. _Ann._ i. 1).\r\n\r\n[439] Liv. iv. 7 “et imperio et insignibus consularibus usos.”\r\n\r\n[440] ib. v. 13, 52.\r\n\r\n[441] “Proconsularis imago” (Liv. v. 2).\r\n\r\n[442] Zonar. vii. 19.\r\n\r\n[443] Liv. iv. 55 “pervincunt, ut senatus consultum fiat de tribunis\r\nmilitum creandis”; iv. 12 “cum ... obtinuisset, ut consulerentur patres,\r\nconsulum an tribunorum placeret comitia haberi.” Dionysius (xi. 60)\r\nrepresents the people as being consulted too.\r\n\r\n[444] i.e. in accordance with the law, if there was one, establishing the\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n[445] Momms. _Staatsr._ ii. p. 191.\r\n\r\n[446] Liv. iv. 8 “ortum autem initium est rei, quod in populo, per multos\r\nannos incenso, neque differri census poterat, neque consulibus, cum tot\r\npopulorum bella imminerent, operae erat id negotium agere.” Cf. Dionys.\r\nxi. 63.\r\n\r\n[447] Liv. l.c. “Idem hic annus censurae initium fuit, rei a parva\r\norigine ortae.”\r\n\r\n[448] Liv. iv. 24. Mommsen indeed thinks (_Staatsr._ ii. p. 349) that\r\nthis _lex Aemilia_ first made the censorship an independent magistracy\r\nwith a fixed tenure. It was probably an independent magistracy before,\r\nbut with no fixed tenure. Hence the belief that the censors originally\r\nheld office for five years, the period of the _lustrum_ (Liv. l.c., cf.\r\nix. 34).\r\n\r\n[449] pp. 81, 102.\r\n\r\n[450] Liv. iv. 43 (discord between the Patres and the Plebs) “exorta\r\nest, coepta ab duplicando quaestorum numero ... praeter duos urbanos\r\nquaestores duo ut consulibus ad ministeria belli praesto essent.”\r\nThe tribunes demanded “ut pars quaestorum ... ex plebe fieret.” The\r\ncompromise arrived at was that “quattuor quaestores promiscue de plebe ac\r\npatribus libero suffragio populi fierent.”\r\n\r\n[451] ib. 54. The Plebs, indignant at the election of consuls in place of\r\nmilitary tribunes, “eum dolorem quaestoriis comitiis simul ostendit, et\r\nulta est, tunc primum plebeiis quaestoribus creatis: ita ut, in quattuor\r\ncreandis, uni patricio K. Fabio Ambusto relinqueretur locus.” For the\r\nelection at the _comitia tributa_ see p. 102.\r\n\r\n[452] p. 83 note 2.\r\n\r\n[453] Liv. iv. 25. The _principes plebis_, in despair at the choice\r\nof the military tribunate always falling on Patricians, came to the\r\nconclusion that it was “ambitione artibusque” of the Patricians. Hence\r\na tribunician measure “ne cui album in vestimentum addere petitionis\r\nliceret causa.” After great resistance “vicere tribuni ut legem\r\nperferrent.”\r\n\r\n[454] “Principes plebis” (Liv. l.c.).\r\n\r\n[455] ib. vi. 31 “conditiones impositae patribus, ne quis, quoad bellatum\r\nesset, tributum daret, aut jus de pecunia credita diceret.”\r\n\r\n[456] ib. 35 “omnium igitur simul rerum, quarum immodica cupido inter\r\nmortales est, agri, pecuniae, honorum, discrimine proposito, conterriti\r\npatres, etc.”\r\n\r\n[457] Liv. vi. 37 “Novam rogationem promulgant, ut pro duumviris sacris\r\nfaciundis decemviri creentur; ita ut pars ex plebe, pars ex patribus\r\nfiat.”\r\n\r\n[458] ib. 38. His statements are inconsistent. He speaks of the college\r\nas being unanimous, and yet of _intercessio_ being used at the meeting.\r\n\r\n[459] Liv. vi. 42 “concessum ... a plebe nobilitati de praetore uno,\r\nqui jus in urbe diceret, ex patribus creando,” probably by a clause\r\nintroduced into the Licinian rogations when they were submitted by the\r\nconsul to the Populus (see p. 97). The true motive is given by Pomponius\r\nin _Dig._ 1, 2, 2, 27, “Cum consules avocarentur bellis finitimis neque\r\nesset, qui in urbe jus reddere posset, factum est ut praetor quoque\r\ncrearetur, qui urbanus appellatus est, quod in urbe jus redderet.”\r\n\r\n[460] Mommsen (_Staatsr._ ii. p. 204) doubts it, chiefly on the ground\r\nthat no law is mentioned as opening the office to Plebeians thirty\r\nyears later. Probably the same doubt hung over the praetorship as over\r\nthe second place in the consulship, i.e. whether the Licinian law, by\r\nreserving one consulship to the Plebs, had left the other posts open to\r\nboth orders or not.\r\n\r\n[461] Liv. vii. 1 “collegam consulibus atque iisdem auspiciis creatum.”\r\nCf. Gell. xiii. 15.\r\n\r\n[462] An instance of the exercise of a consular veto over a judicial\r\ndecision of a praetor in 77 B.C. is preserved by Valerius Maximus (vii.\r\n7, 6).\r\n\r\n[463] Liv. viii. 15 “eodem anno Q. Publilius Philo praetor primus\r\nde plebe, adversante Sulpicio consule, qui negabat rationem ejus se\r\nhabiturum, est factus; senatu, cum in summis imperiis id non obtinuisset,\r\nminus in praetura intendente.”\r\n\r\n[464] p. 98.\r\n\r\n[465] Liv. vi. 42 “Factum senatus consultum, ut duo viros aediles ex\r\npatribus dictator populum rogaret.”\r\n\r\n[466] ib. vii. 1 (366 B.C.) “verecundia inde imposita est senatui ex\r\npatribus jubendi aediles curules creari. primo, ut alternis annis ex\r\nplebe fierent, convenerat; [this was the rule in 213 (Polyb. x. 4)].\r\npostea promiscuum fuit” [Mommsen (_Staatsr._ ii. p. 482) thinks as late\r\nas the last century of the Republic].\r\n\r\n[467] ib. 17 “dictator C. Marcius Rutilus primus de plebe dictus”; he\r\nappointed a plebeian master of the horse.\r\n\r\n[468] ib. 22. The same C. Marcius Rutilus “professus censuram se petere”\r\nwas elected.\r\n\r\n[469] ib. viii. 12 “ut alter utique ex plebe ... censor crearetur.”\r\n\r\n[470] ib. _Ep._ 59 “Q. Pompeius et Q. Metellus, tunc primum utrique ex\r\nplebe facti, censores lustrum condiderunt.”\r\n\r\n[471] Liv. vii. 42. The law was proposed by the tribune L. Genucius. It\r\nwas not, however, until the year 172 B.C. that both consuls were plebeian\r\n(Liv. xlii. 9; Fast. Cap. _C.I.L._ i. 1 p. 25).\r\n\r\n[472] p. 52.\r\n\r\n[473] Livy (x. 6) marvels at the fact; he thinks that it must have been\r\naccidental (“morte duorum”), since the augural college should have\r\nconsisted of three or of a multiple of three. Cicero (_de Rep._ ii. 9,\r\n16) says that Romulus coopted (_cooptavit_) one from each of the three\r\ntribes; they were therefore four; that Numa added two (ib. ii. 14, 26).\r\nThis makes six, which Livy (l.c.) thinks the normal number at the time of\r\nthe passing of the Ogulnian law.\r\n\r\n[474] Liv. x. 6. These numbers remained unaltered until the time of Sulla\r\n(81 B.C.), who raised the colleges of pontiffs and augurs to fifteen\r\n(Liv. _Ep._ 89). A sixteenth was added to both colleges by Julius Caesar\r\n(Dio Cass. xlii. 51).\r\n\r\n[475] Liv. xxxiii. 42. The number was afterwards increased to seven, from\r\nwhich time the college was known as that of the _VIIviri epulones_.\r\n\r\n[476] Marquardt _Staatsverw._ iii. p. 333.\r\n\r\n[477] Liv. iii. 32 “augur (mortuus est) C. Horatius Pulvillus; in cujus\r\nlocum C. Veturium eo cupidius, quia damnatus a plebe erat, augures\r\nlegere.” The _pontifex maximus_ was early an exception to this rule; see\r\nthe _comitia sacerdotum_ in the section dealing with the people.\r\n\r\n[478] Cic. _de Leg. Agr._ ii. 7, 18; Vell. ii. 12.\r\n\r\n[479] Liv. viii. 12.\r\n\r\n[480] p. 109.\r\n\r\n[481] Mr. Strachan-Davidson conjectures that the law of Publilius Philo\r\n“may have struck out the intervening consultation of the Senate, and\r\nmay have required the consul to bring the petition of the Plebs at once\r\nbefore the Populus” (Smith _Dict. of Antiq._ s.v. _plebiscitum_, ii. p.\r\n439).\r\n\r\n[482] p. 83.\r\n\r\n[483] The only evidence that they were is furnished by Livy’s account\r\nof a _lex Manlia_ of 357 B.C. (Willems _Droit Public_ p. 183). See Liv.\r\nvii. 16 (Manlius the consul) “legem, novo exemplo ad Sutrium in castris\r\ntributim de vicesima eorum, qui manumitterentur, tulit. Patres, quia ea\r\nlege haud parvum vectigal inopi aerario additum esset, auctores fuerunt.”\r\n\r\n[484] ib. viii. 12 “ut legum, quae comitiis centuriatis ferrentur, ante\r\ninitum suffragium patres auctores fierent.”\r\n\r\n[485] Cic. _Brut._ 14, 55. Cf. Liv. i. 17 “hodie ... in legibus\r\nmagistratibusque rogandis usurpatur idem jus (the _patrum auctoritas_),\r\nvi adempta.”\r\n\r\n[486] Laelius Felix ap. Gell. 15, 27 “(plebi scitis) ante patricii non\r\ntenebantur, donec Q. Hortensius dictator legem tulit, ut eo jure quod\r\nplebs statuisset, omnes quirites tenerentur”; Plin. _H.N._ xvi. 10, 37\r\n“ut quod ea (plebs) jussisset, omnes quirites teneret.”\r\n\r\n[487] Gaius i. 3 “olim patricii dicebant plebi scitis se non teneri, quia\r\nsine auctoritate eorum facta essent; sed postea lex Hortensia lata est,\r\nqua cautum est, ut plebi scita universum populum tenerent, itaque eo\r\nmodo legibus exaequata sunt”; Pompon. in _Dig._ 1, 2, 2, 8 “pro legibus\r\nplacuit et ea (plebiscita) observari lege Hortensia: et ita factum est,\r\nut inter plebis scita et legem species constituendi interesset, potestas\r\nautem eadem esset.”\r\n\r\n[488] Pompon. l.c.\r\n\r\n[489] The _lex Agraria_ of 111 B.C. (Bruns _Fontes_) thus refers to\r\na _lex Sempronia_ of 123 B.C., “[ex] lege plebeive scito, quod C.\r\nSempronius Ti. f. tr. pl. rogavit.” Cf. _lex Rubria_ (ib.) “ex lege\r\nRubria seive id pl. sc. est.”\r\n\r\n[490] Thus Cicero, exiled by a _plebiscitum_, was restored by a _lex\r\ncenturiata_. See the section on the people.\r\n\r\n[491] Of the many instances one of the most remarkable is to be found in\r\nSall. _Jug._ 84, “Marius ... cupientissima plebe consul factus, postquam\r\nei provinciam Numidiam populus jussit.” Here _plebs_ should be _populus_\r\nand _populus_, _plebs_.\r\n\r\n[492] “Legislative” is here used in the modern sense. At Rome a judicial\r\nand elective act of the people was equally a _lex_.\r\n\r\n[493] At least in 304 B.C. they had no right of _relatio_ with the Senate\r\n(Liv. ix. 46).\r\n\r\n[494] Gaius iv. 23.\r\n\r\n[495] Varro _L.L._ viii. 105 “Hoc (the condition of _nexum_) C. Poetilio\r\nLibone Visolo dictatore (313 B.C.) sublatum ne fieret; et omnes, qui\r\nbonam copiam jurarunt, ne essent nexi dissoluti.” Livy (viii. 28), who\r\nattributes the measure to 326 B.C., makes it a universal release of\r\n_nexi_: “jussique consoles ferre ad populum, ne quis, nisi qui noxam\r\nmeruisset, donec poenam lueret, in compedibus aut in nervo teneretur:\r\npecuniae creditae bona debitoris, non corpus obnoxium esset.”\r\n\r\n[496] Liv. ix. 46 “Cn. Flavius ... patre libertino ... civile jus,\r\nrepositum in penetralibus pontificum, evulgavit, fastosque circa forum in\r\nalbo proposuit, ut quando lege agi posset, sciretur”; Pompon. in _Dig._\r\n1, 2, 2, 7 “postea cum Appius Claudius composuisset (for “proposuisset”)\r\net ad formam redegisset has actiones, Cn. Flavius scriba ejus libertini\r\nfilius subreptum librum populo tradidit ... hic liber, qui actiones\r\ncontinet, appellator jus civile Flavianum.”\r\n\r\n[497] Pompon. l.c. §§ 37, 38. Gaius Scipio Nasica was given a house\r\nfor consultations. The first professor, Ti. Coruncanius (“qui primus\r\nprofiteri coepit,” circ. 280 B.C.), was also the first plebeian _pontifex\r\nmaximus_.\r\n\r\n[498] Polyb. vi. 53.\r\n\r\n[499] Cic. _in Verr._ v. 14, 36 “togam praetextam, sellam curulem, jus\r\nimaginis ad memoriam posteritatemque prodendae.”\r\n\r\n[500] In other words, images of other than curule ancestors might be set\r\nup in the _atrium_.\r\n\r\n[501] p. 22.\r\n\r\n[502] Sallust. _Jug._ 95 (of Sulla) “gentis patriciae nobilis fuit,\r\nfamilia prope jam exstincta majorum ignavia.”\r\n\r\n[503] Cic. _pro Mur._ 7. 16; Ascon. _in Scaurian_. p. 22.\r\n\r\n[504] Dionys. vii. 71.\r\n\r\n[505] Cf. Cic. _de Off._ ii. 17, 58 “Vitanda tamen suspicio est\r\navaritiae. Mamerco, homini divitissimo, praetermissio aedilitatis\r\nconsulatus repulsam attulit.”\r\n\r\n[506] Liv. xxii. 34 (of the election of Varro, 217 B.C.) “Patres summa\r\nope obstabant, ne se insectando sibi aequari adsuescerent homines.”\r\n\r\n[507] Sallust. _Jug._ 63 “consulatum nobilitas inter se per manus\r\ntradebat; novus nemo tam clarus neque tam egregiis factis erat, quin\r\nindignus illo honore, et is quasi pollutus, haberetur.”\r\n\r\n[508] Cic. _pro Domo_ 14, 38 “Ita populus Romanus brevi tempore, neque\r\nregem sacrorum, neque flamines, neque salios habebit, nec ex parte\r\ndimidia reliquos sacerdotes, neque auctores centuriatorum et curiatorum\r\ncomitiorum: auspiciaque populi Romani, si magistratus patricii creati\r\nnon sint, intereant necesse est, cum interrex nullus sit, quod et ipsum\r\npatricium esse et a patriciis prodi necesse est.” The passage is closely\r\nfollowed by Livy vi. 41, in the speech against the Licinio-Sextian\r\nlaws, with which he credits Appius Claudius. We meet with other archaic\r\nsurvivals in connexion with the Senate—the distinction, e.g., between\r\nthe “greater and lesser _gentes_” (p. 12) was never lost, and the chief\r\nof the Senate, the first member on the list, was always chosen from the\r\n_gentes majores_ (see p. 12).\r\n\r\n[509] Ulpian _Reg._ v. 8 “conubio interveniente liberi semper patrem\r\nsequuntur; non interveniente conubio matris conditioni accedunt, excepto\r\neo qui ex peregrino et cive Romana peregrinus nascitur, quoniam lex\r\nMensia [“Minicia” has been read in the Veronese palimpsest of the\r\nparallel passage of Gaius i. 78, ed. Krueger and Studemund] ex alterutro\r\nperegrino natum deterioris parentis conditionem sequi jubet.”\r\n\r\n[510] Or, in the Principate, an administrative act. See the section on\r\nthe powers of the Princeps.\r\n\r\n[511] p. 6.\r\n\r\n[512] Beloch _Der Italische Bund_ pp. 101, 102.\r\n\r\n[513] Tac. _Ann._ xi. 25; Beloch op. cit. p. 78. According to Beloch\r\n(l.c.) a comparison between the ante-imperial and post-imperial census is\r\nvitiated by the fact that the _aerarii_ were excluded from the former,\r\nincluded in the latter. See the section on the censor.\r\n\r\n[514] _Lex Acilia Repetundarum_ 1. 76.\r\n\r\n[515] Cic. _pro Balbo_ 10, 25 “quod iis ... liceat, si populus Romanus\r\npermiserit, ut ab senatu, ab imperatoribus nostris, civitate donentur.”\r\n\r\n[516] Cic. _Brut._ 20, 79; _pro Balbo_ 21, 48.\r\n\r\n[517] See the section dealing with the _comitia_.\r\n\r\n[518] Suet. _Aug._ 40; Senec. _de Vit. Beat._ 24.\r\n\r\n[519] It implied the _imperium_. At Rome these magistrates would be\r\nconsul, praetor, dictator, or interrex; in the provinces the governors.\r\n\r\n[520] Gaius iv. 16.\r\n\r\n[521] “Praetor addicit libertatem.” See Cic. _ad Att._ vii. 2, 8.\r\n\r\n[522] For the censor as such had no power to confer freedom (Mommsen\r\n_Staatsr._ ii. p. 374). Cicero (_de Orat._ i. 40, 183) mentions the\r\njuristic controversy whether the slave was free from the moment of the\r\nannouncement or from the _lustrum_, which gave validity to the censorian\r\nordinances. _Servi publici_ were manumitted by the magistrates, but\r\nwhether by the consul only or by any magistrate is unknown (Momms.\r\n_Staatsr._ i. p. 321). The greatest instance of state emancipation is\r\nthat of the _Volones_ in 214 B.C. (Liv. xxiv. 16).\r\n\r\n[523] In the first case it is called _directa libertas_ (_Dig._ 40, 4,\r\n35), in the second _libertas fidei commissa_ (Dig. 40, 4, 11).\r\n\r\n[524] Theophilus (i. 5, 4) calls them φυσικοὶ τρόποι ἐλευθερίας.\r\n\r\n[525] Suet. _Claud._ 24 (Claudius said that App. Caecus, censor in 312\r\nB.C., had chosen the sons of _libertini_ for the Senate) “ignarus,\r\ntemporibus Appii et deinceps aliquamdiu, ‘libertinos’ dictos, non ipsos,\r\nqui manu mitterentur, sed ingenuos ex his procreatos.”\r\n\r\n[526] Justin. _Inst._ i. 4 “qui statim ut natus est liber est”; Cic.\r\n_de Nat. Deor._ iii. 18, 45 “in jure civili, qui est matre libera,\r\nliber est.” This is the sense in which Cincius (_ap. Fest._ p. 241) and\r\nLivy (x. 8) declare _patricius_ to have been originally equivalent to\r\n_ingenuus_. See p. 5.\r\n\r\n[527] The _s(ine) p(atre) filii_ of Gaius (i. 64) and Plutarch (_Qu.\r\nRom._ 103) was a conjecture of the jurists based on the abbreviated form\r\nof _sp(urii) filii_ (Momms. _Staatsr._ iii p. 72 n. 4). _Spurii filii_\r\nwas the official designation, while _liberi naturales_ denoted the\r\nnatural relationship to the father (Meyer _Der römische Concubinat_).\r\n\r\n[528] p. 35.\r\n\r\n[529] p. 131.\r\n\r\n[530] p. 45.\r\n\r\n[531] p. 98.\r\n\r\n[532] _Lex Coloniae Genetivae_ (a foundation of Caesar’s in 44 B.C. at\r\nOsuna in Spain) c. 98 “Quamcumque munitionem decuriones hujusce coloniae\r\ndecreverint ... eam munitionem fieri liceto, dum ne amplius in annos\r\nsingulos ... operas quinas ... decernant.”\r\n\r\n[533] The other chief personal burdens are guardianship (_tutela_) and\r\nserving on juries; but the consideration of both belongs rather to civil\r\nand criminal than to public law.\r\n\r\n[534] p. 69.\r\n\r\n[535] p. 74.\r\n\r\n[536] p. 73.\r\n\r\n[537] Liv. xxxiii. 42 (196 B.C.) “Pecunia opus erat, quod ultimam\r\npensionem pecuniae in bellum conlatae persolvi placuerat privatis.” Cf.\r\nv. 20 and Plin. _H.N._ xxxiv. 6.\r\n\r\n[538] Cic. _de Off._ ii. 22, 76 “Paulus tantum in aerarium pecuniae\r\ninvexit, ut unius imperatoris praeda finem attulerit tributorum”;\r\nPlutarch, _Paul._ 38.\r\n\r\n[539] _Lex Acilia Repetundarum_ c. 79; amongst the rewards granted to a\r\nLatin who prosecuted successfully under this law are “militiae munerisque\r\npoplici in sua quojusque ceivitate vocatio immunitasque.”\r\n\r\n[540] Cic. _pro Caec._ 34.\r\n\r\n[541] Cic. l.c.; _de Orat._ i. 40.\r\n\r\n[542] Cic. _pro Caec._ 34; Dionys. iv. 15\r\n\r\n[543] p. 32.\r\n\r\n[544] Eisele _Beiträge zur römischen Rechtsgeschichte_ p. 205.\r\n\r\n[545] Gaius i. 159-162; Ulp. xi. 10-13.\r\n\r\n[546] p. 31.\r\n\r\n[547] For the form of _deditio_ see Liv. ix. 10; App. _de Reb.

Plutarch, in this story of the imaginary\r\nfreedman Vindicius, represents his class as having no voting rights at\r\nthe beginning of the Republic.

Nothing is said about their division\r\ninto _classes_; according to the arrangement of the reformed _comitia\r\ncenturiata_ (see the section on the _comitia_), this restriction to four\r\ntribes would have given them the command of only forty centuries.\r\n\r\n[588] Liv. xlv. 15.\r\n\r\n[589] _Auct. de Vir.

Even in the social war they\r\nformed cohorts separate from the legions.\r\n\r\n[593] First mentioned in 217 B.C. (Liv. xxii. 11).\r\n\r\n[594] See the section on the magistracy (p. 184).\r\n\r\n[595] e.g. the institution of the censor, praetor, curule aediles,\r\nand (although they are not a part of the developed constitution), the\r\nconsular tribunes.\r\n\r\n[596] p. 121.\r\n\r\n[597] Cic. _ad Att._ ix. 9, 3 “in libris (i.e. the augural books) habemus\r\nnon modo consules a praetore, sed ne praetores quidem creari jus esse.”\r\n\r\n[598] p. 47.\r\n\r\n[599] p. 47.\r\n\r\n[600] See the section on the magistracy (p. 165).\r\n\r\n[601] Cic. _de Leg._ iii. 3, 9 “ast quando consoles magisterve populi\r\n(i.e. dictator) nec escunt, auspicia patrum sunto, ollique ex se produnto\r\nqui comitiatu creare consules rite possint”; _ad Brut._ i. 5, 4 “dum unus\r\nerit patricius magistratus, auspicia ad patres redire non possunt.”\r\n\r\n[602] In 43 B.C., on the deaths of Hirtius and Pansa, this communication\r\ncould not be made in time. Hence the extraordinary measure of appointing\r\ntwo _privati_ with _consularis potestas_ to hold the election for the\r\nconsulship (Dio Cass, xlvi. 45).\r\n\r\n[603] The _senatus consultum_ containing this suggestion might be vetoed\r\nby one of the tribunes. Ascon, _in Milon._ p. 32 “dum ... Pompeius ...\r\net T. Munatius tr. pl. referri ad senatum de patriciis convocandis qui\r\ninterregem proderent non essent passi.”\r\n\r\n[604] p. 47.\r\n\r\n[605] Liv. v. 31, 8 “interrex creatur M. Furius Camillus.”\r\n\r\n[606] The technical expression _prodere interregem_ refers in Republican\r\ntimes, not only to the appointment of the first interrex by election, but\r\nto the nomination of each of the other _interreges_ by his predecessor\r\n(Liv. vi. 41; v. 31).\r\n\r\n[607] Liv. vi. 1; viii. 23.\r\n\r\n[608] Cic. _pro Dom._ 14, 38, quoted p. 131.\r\n\r\n[609] Willems _le Sénat_ ii. pp. 14, 16.\r\n\r\n[610] p. 126.\r\n\r\n[611] See Appendix on the _comitia tributa_.\r\n\r\n[612] p. 89.\r\n\r\n[613] The power of this body was much increased by the long wars waged in\r\nWest and East; but its ascendency was assured before these wars began.\r\nSee the section on the Senate.\r\n\r\n[614] For an instance of its cumulative use see Cic. _in Verr._ act. i.\r\n13, 37 “erit tunc consul Hortensius cum summo imperio et potestate”; for\r\none of its disjunctive uses see _Dig._ 4, 6, 26, 2 “consulem praetorem\r\nceterosque qui imperium potestatemve quam habent.”\r\n\r\n[615] p. 79.\r\n\r\n[616] Mommsen (_Staatsr._ i. p. 203) denies the right of the quaestor\r\nto issue edicts; but the absence of distinct mention of quaestorian\r\nedicts is no ground for denying him what appears to have been a common\r\nmagisterial right.\r\n\r\n[617] For the pro-magistrates see the sections on the consuls and the\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\n[618] In the course of the Republic _imperium_ came to denote _par\r\nexcellence_ command abroad, as was natural, since here alone the power\r\nwas unshackled. Hence the phrase _cum imperio_ esse descriptive of a\r\nmagistrate who can assert this latent power (Cic. _ad Fam._ viii. 8, 8\r\n“qui praetores fuerunt neque in provincia cum imperio fuerunt”) and the\r\nopposition between _magistratus_ and _imperium_. _Lex Tab. Bant._ 1. 16\r\n“quibus quisque eorum mag(istratum) imperiumve inierit”; _Lex Acilia\r\nRep._ 1. 8 “dum magi(stratum) aut imperium habebunt.”\r\n\r\n[619] Liv. iii. 42; xxviii. 45.\r\n\r\n[620] Polyb. vi. 19, 21. The tenor of the oath was (c. 21) ἧ μὴν\r\nπειθαρχήσειν καὶ ποιήσειν τὸ προσταττόμενον ὑπὸ τῶν ἀρχόντων κατὰ δύναμιν.\r\n\r\n[621] The soldier is said “jurare in verba consilium” (Liv. ii. 52).\r\n\r\n[622] Liv. iii. 20.\r\n\r\n[623] ib. viii. 34 “latrocinii modo caeca et fortuita pro sollemni et\r\nsacrata militia sit.”\r\n\r\n[624] Dionys. xi. 43.\r\n\r\n[625] p. 79.\r\n\r\n[626] See the section on the _intercessio_.\r\n\r\n[627] Liv. vii. 5.\r\n\r\n[628] ib. xxvii. 36.\r\n\r\n[629] _Lex Acilia_ 1. 2.\r\n\r\n[630] They were called _Rufuli_ (Liv. vii. 5; Festus p. 260).\r\n\r\n[631] Liv. xlii. 31 (171 B.C., commencement of war with Perseus)\r\n“consoles ex senatus consulto ad populum tulerunt, ne tribuni militum eo\r\nanno suffragiis crearentur, sed consulum praetorumque in iis faciendis\r\njudicium arbitriumque esset.” Cf. xliii. 12.\r\n\r\n[632] Polyb. vi. 13.\r\n\r\n[633] p. 117.\r\n\r\n[634] See Greenidge, “The provocatio militiae and provincial\r\njurisdiction” in _Classical Review_ x. p. 225.\r\n\r\n[635] The fact that the delegates and sometimes the crimes were distinct\r\nin the two cases does not make the military jurisdiction of the\r\n_imperator_ differ from his ordinary criminal jurisdiction, as Mommsen\r\nseems to think (_Staatsr._ i. p. 123). For the proofs of unity in the\r\nconception of jurisdiction _militiae_ see the article cited in the last\r\nnote.\r\n\r\n[636] At the close of the Republic, however, custom dictated that the\r\ngovernor should send capital cases in which Romans were involved to Rome.\r\nSee the section on the provinces.\r\n\r\n[637] Tac. _Ann._ iii. 74 “Tiberius ... Blaeso tribuit, ut imperator\r\na legionibus salutaretur, prisco ergo duces honore, qui bene gesta\r\nrepublica gaudio et impetu victoris exercitus conclamabantur.” The\r\nearliest instance recorded is that of the elder Scipio Africanus (Liv.\r\nxxvii. 19). At the close of the Republic the title might be conferred by\r\nthe Senate. Cic. _Phil._ xiv. 4, 11 (to emphasise the fact that Antonius\r\nwas a public enemy Servilius had proposed _supplicationes_) “Sed hoc\r\nprimum faciam, ut imperatores appellem eos, quorum virtute ... periculis\r\n... liberati sumus.” For who, he asks, has not been called _imperator_\r\nwithin the last twenty years “aut minimis rebus gestis, aut plerumque\r\nnullis”? (cf. Cic. _ad Att._ v. 20, 3).\r\n\r\n[638] Dio Cass. xxxvii. 40.\r\n\r\n[639] For the consular tribune see p. 114.\r\n\r\n[640] An important exception is recorded in Liv. vii. 11 (360 B.C.). Here\r\nthe consul triumphs after the abdication of the dictator, and the honour\r\nis clearly a concession of the latter.\r\n\r\n[641] Liv. xxviii. 9 (207 B.C.).\r\n\r\n[642] In this case the lesser honour of an “ovation” was sometimes\r\ngranted (Liv. xxvi. 21; xxviii. 9).\r\n\r\n[643] Liv. xxxix. 29 (185 B.C.).\r\n\r\n[644] Gell. v. 6; Val. Max. ii. 8, 7. In this case, too, the ovation was\r\nsometimes granted, e.g. in the slave-wars of 99 and 71 B.C. (Cic. _de\r\nOrat._ ii. 47, 195; Gell. v. 6). For this reason Caesar’s triumph in 46\r\nwas over Gaul, Egypt, Pontus and Africa; that of Augustus in 29 over\r\nDalmatia and Egypt. In neither case was it held over the citizens whom\r\nthey had crushed.\r\n\r\n[645] Val. Max. ii. 8, 1.\r\n\r\n[646] Liv. xxxiii. 23; xlii. 21.\r\n\r\n[647] Mommsen thinks the use of it as well (_Staatsr._ i p. 132), e.g.\r\nthat it was in consequence of the absence of the _provocatio_ that the\r\n_cives Romani Campani_ were executed in 271 (Val. Max. ii. 7, 15).\r\n\r\n[648] e.g. L. Postumius Megellus in 294 B.C. (Liv. x. 37), App. Claudius\r\nin 143 B.C. (Suet. _Tib._ 2).\r\n\r\n[649] “Senatus consulto jussuque populi” (Liv. iv. 20).\r\n\r\n[650] Polyb. vi. 15 τοὺς ... θριάμβους ... οὐ δύνανται χειρίζειν\r\nὡς πρέπει, ποτὲ δὲ τὸ παράπαν οὐδὲ συντελεῖν, ἐὰν μὴ τὸ συνέδριον\r\nσυγκατάθηται καὶ δῷ τὴν εἰς ταῦτα δαπάνην.\r\n\r\n[651] Liv. xxvi. 21. Cf. Liv. xlv. 35, where the Senate’s request to the\r\ntribune is made through a praetor. One cannot say in this case that the\r\n_imperium_ is conferred for the day, since the Plebs had no power to\r\nconfer the _imperium_.\r\n\r\n[652] ib. xxviii. 38; cf. xxxi. 20.\r\n\r\n[653] e.g. the two triumphs of Pompeius in 80 and 71 B.C. See Cic. _pro\r\nLege Man._ 21, 62 “quid tam incredibile, quam ut iterum eques Romanus ex\r\nsenatus consulto triumpharet?”\r\n\r\n[654] A shortened form of _conventio_. Cf. _S. C. de Bacchanalibus_\r\n(Bruns _Fontes_) l. 23 “haice uti in conventionid exdeicatis.”\r\n\r\n[655] Gell. xiii. 16 “cum populo agere est rogare quid populum, quod\r\nsuffragiis suis aut jubeat aut vetet, contionem autem habere est verba\r\nfacere ad populum sine ulla rogatione.”\r\n\r\n[656] It was, e.g., the mode in which the people were summoned to witness\r\npublic executions outside the Pomerium (Cic. _pro Rab._ 4, 11; Tac.\r\n_Ann._ ii. 23).\r\n\r\n[657] _S. C. de Bacch._ quoted p. 158.\r\n\r\n[658] Liv. xxxix. 15 “contione advocata cum sollemne carmen precationis,\r\nquod praefari priusquam populum adloquantur magistratus solent,\r\nperegisset, consul ita coepit.”\r\n\r\n[659] Messala ap. Gell. xiii. 16 includes the _magistratus minores_.\r\nMommsen, guided by the (in this case probably false) analogy of the _jus\r\ncum populo agendi_, would exclude the aediles and quaestors (_Staatsr._\r\ni. p. 200).\r\n\r\n[660] Gell. l.c.\r\n\r\n[661] Cic. _ad Att._ iv. 1, 6 “habui contionem, omnes magistratus praeter\r\nunum praetorem et duos tribunos pl. dederunt”; i. 14, 1 “Pisonis consulis\r\nimpulsu levissimus tribunus pl. Fufius in contionem producit Pompeium”;\r\nii. 24, 3 “Caesar is qui olim, praetor cum esset, Q. Catulum ex inferiore\r\nloco jusserat dicere, Vettium in rostra produxit.”\r\n\r\n[662] Sall. _Jug._ 34 “ubi Memmius (a tribune) dicendi finem fecit et\r\nJugurtha respondere jussus est, C. Baebius tribunus plebis ... regem\r\ntacere jubet.”\r\n\r\n[663] See note 1.\r\n\r\n[664] Cic. _de Leg._ iii. 4, 10 “cum populo patribusque agendi jus esto\r\nconsuli praetori magistro populi equitumque eique quem patres produnt\r\nconsulum rogandorum ergo.” For the question whether the praefect of the\r\ncity had this right see p. 61; an argument for his possession of it in\r\nthe Republic is his right of consulting the Senate.\r\n\r\n[665] For the curule aediles see Cic. _in Verr._ i. 12, 36; Val. Max.\r\nviii. 1, 7.\r\n\r\n[666] Liv. iii. 24; Dionys. viii. 77.\r\n\r\n[667] Liv. xliii. 16 (169 B.C., P. Rutilius tr. pl.) “C. Claudio diem\r\ndixit ... et utrique censori perduellionem se judicare pronunciavit,\r\ndiemque comitiis a C. Sulpicio praetore urbano petiit ... absoluto\r\nClaudio, tribunus plebis negavit se Gracchum morari.” Antias ap. Gell.\r\nvi. 9 “Licinius tribunus plebi perduellionem ei diem dixit et comitiis\r\ndiem a M. Marcio praetore peposcit.”\r\n\r\n[668] Whether the tribune presided over this assembly is uncertain. When\r\nthe tribune in Livy (l.c.) breaks up such an assembly the act may simply\r\nrefer to his retirement as a prosecutor (see last note).\r\n\r\n[669] Liv. x. 23; xxv. 2; xxxiii. 42; Gell. x. 6.\r\n\r\n[670] _De Leg._ iii. 4, 10, cited p. 160.\r\n\r\n[671] Gell. xiv. 7 “(Varro ponit) per quos more majorum senatus haberi\r\nsoleret eosque nominat ‘dictatorem, consules, praetores, tribunos plebi,\r\ninterregem, praefectum urbi’ ... ‘deinde extraordinario jure tribunos\r\nquoque militares qui pro consulibus fuissent ... jus consulendi senatum\r\nhabuisse.’”\r\n\r\n[672] This right of the tribunes originated later than 304 B.C.; see p.\r\n127.\r\n\r\n[673] Liv. xxii. 30; xl. 52.

For their use in camp see\r\nCic. _de Div._ i. 35, 77; Val. Max. i. 4, 3. In the last passage the\r\nincident connected with P. Claudius Pulcher (249 B.C.) is described.\r\n\r\n[690] Messala ap. Gell. xiii. 15 “Patriciorum auspicia in duas sunt\r\ndivisa potestates. Maxima sunt consulum, praetorum censorum....\r\nReliquorum magistratuum minora sunt auspicia.”\r\n\r\n[691] Gell. iii. 2.\r\n\r\n[692] “Oriens de nocte silentio” (Liv. viii. 23).\r\n\r\n[693] That in the camp, by means of the sacred chickens, had naturally to\r\nbe exempted from these formalities.\r\n\r\n[694] Cic. _de Nat. Deor._ ii. 4, 11; these tents were called _minora\r\ntempla_ (Festus p. 157).\r\n\r\n[695] The manipulation of auspices at the end of the Republic had caused\r\nthe skilled assistant to be neglected (Cic. _de Div._ ii. 34, 71 “apud\r\nmajores nostros adhibebatur peritus, nunc quilibet”).\r\n\r\n[696] Liv. ix. 39, etc.\r\n\r\n[697] See the section dealing with the powers of the people. The _vitium_\r\neffected the elections even of tribunes of the Plebs—but purely as a\r\nresult of _auspicia oblativa_. See Liv. x. 47 (293 B.C.) “exacto jam anno\r\nnovi tribuni plebis magistratum inierant: hisque ipsis, quia vitio creati\r\nerant, quinque post dies alii subfecti.”\r\n\r\n[698] ib. v. 31, etc.\r\n\r\n[699] Mommsen thinks that the auspices of the consuls might have\r\nalternated, like their fasces, from month to month (_Staatsr._ i. p. 95).\r\n\r\n[700] Thus before Cannae Varro takes the field in spite of the ill-omens\r\nwhich the observation of his colleague Paulus had revealed (Liv. xxii.\r\n42).\r\n\r\n[701] Val. Max. ii. 8, 2.\r\n\r\n[702] Cic. _de Leg._ iii. 3, 6 “magistratus nec oboedientem et noxium\r\ncivem multa, vinculis, verberibus coerceto, ni par majorve potestas\r\npopulusve prohibessit, ad quos provocatio esto.” A _lex Porcia_\r\nprohibited the scourging of a Roman citizen by a _gravis poena_ (Liv.\r\nx. 9); but that technically it merely submitted the threat of such\r\n_coercitio_ to appeal is shown by the fact that the law is classed\r\namongst those regulating the _provocatio_ (Cic. _de Rep._ ii. 31, 54).\r\n\r\n[703] pp. 79, 109.\r\n\r\n[704] Liv. x. 9 “cum eum qui provocasset virgis caedi securique necari\r\nvetuisset, si quis adversus ea fecisset, nihil ultra quam improbe factum\r\nadjecit.” The meaning of this sanction has been much disputed: it may\r\nmean “incapable of making a will,” on the analogy of “improbus (i.e. qui\r\nprobare non potest) intestabilisque esto.” Mommsen (_Strafrecht_ p. 632)\r\ntakes the expression to mean that the act of the magistrate would be\r\nregarded as “unjustified,” i.e. as an ordinary criminal offence.\r\n\r\n[705] Cic. _de Rep._ ii. 31, 54.\r\n\r\n[706] p. 95.\r\n\r\n[707] Dio Cass. liii. 17.\r\n\r\n[708] Plin. _H.N._ vii 44; Liv. _Ep._ 59.\r\n\r\n[709] Liv. ii 55; vii. 4.\r\n\r\n[710] The _virgis caedi_ in the third _lex Valeria_ (note 2) probably\r\nrefers to scourging as well as to death by the rod.\r\n\r\n[711] Capito ap. Gell. iv. 10 “Caesar consul viatorem vocavit eumque\r\n(Catonem), cum finem non faceret (of speaking in the Senate) prendi\r\nloquentem et in carcerem duci jussit.” Cf. Suet. _Caes._ 17.\r\n\r\n[712] The earliest recorded case is in Liv. _Ep._ xlviii. (Momms.\r\n_Staatsr._ i. p. 154). A typical instance belonging to the year 60 B.C.\r\nis described in Cic. _ad Att._ ii. 1, 8; Dio Cass. xxxvii. 50.\r\n\r\n[713] It was thus that the imprisonment of M. Bibulus, consul in 59 (Cic.\r\n_in Vat._ 9, 21), and of M. Crassus, consul in 55 (Dio Cass. xxxix. 39),\r\nwas prevented.\r\n\r\n[714] The annals introduce bail as early as the trial of Kaeso Quinctius\r\nin 461 B.C. (Liv. iii. 13).\r\n\r\n[715] Liv. xxv. 4 (212 B.C.).\r\n\r\n[716] Mommsen (_Staatsr._ i. p. 143 n. 1) takes the view that the\r\nquaestor had no power of _coercitio_ through _multa_ and _pignus_. For an\r\nopposite opinion see Karlowa _Rechtsgesch._ i. p. 171 and Huschke _Multa_\r\np. 36.\r\n\r\n[717] Dionys. x. 50 ἐπὶ τῆς λοχίτιδος ἐκκλησίας νόμον ἐκύρωσαν (the\r\nconsuls Sp. Tarpeius and A. Aternius) ἵνα ταῖς ἀρχαῖς ἐξῇ πάσαις τοὺς\r\nἀκοσμοῦντας ἤ παρανομοῦντας εἰς τὴν ἑαυτῶν ἐξουσίαν ζημιοῦν· τέως γὰρ οὐχ\r\nἅπασιν ἐξῆν ἀλλὰ τοῖς ὑπάτοις μόνοις. Cf. Cic. _de Rep._ ii. 35, 60.\r\n\r\n[718] Dionys. l.c.; Gell. xi. 1. Dionysius (probably by an error of the\r\ncopyist) represents the fine as being two oxen or thirty sheep.\r\n\r\n[719] Cic. _de Rep._ ii. 35, 60 “levis aestimatio pecudum in multa lege\r\nC. Julii, P. Papirii consulum constituta est”; Liv. iv. 30 “legem de\r\nmultarum aestimatione pergratam populo ... ipsi (the consuls Julius and\r\nPapirius) praeoccupaverunt ferre”; Gell. xi. 1 “in oves singulas aeris\r\ndeni, in boves aeris centeni ... Suprema multa est ejus numeri, ... ultra\r\nquem multam dicere in dies singulos jus non est.” Gellius, however,\r\nattributes the pecuniary estimate to the _lex Aternia_.\r\n\r\n[720] The view has been sometimes held that the _multa suprema_ was one\r\nbeyond which the magistrate could not under any circumstances go. In this\r\ncase there is no known limit at which the appeal became possible. That\r\nthere was one, however, is shown by the _provocatio ab omni judicio_\r\nallowed by the Twelve Tables (Cic. _de Rep._ ii. 31, 54. See p. 106).\r\n\r\n[721] p. 246.\r\n\r\n[722] _Lex Tab. Bant._ 1. 12 “Sei quis mag(istratus) multam inrogare\r\nvolet [_quei volet, dum minoris_] partus familias taxsat, liceto.”\r\n\r\n[723] e.g. in case of continued resistance to the veto. See Liv. xliii.\r\n16 (169 B.C., P. Rutilius) “Ti Gracchi primum bona consecravit, quod in\r\nmulta pignoribusque ejus, qui tribunum adpellasset, intercessioni non\r\nparendo, se in ordinem coegisset”; or for a supposed stigma inflicted\r\nby a censor on a tribune (Plin. _H.N._ vii. 44). Cicero, _pro Domo_ 47,\r\n123, mentions the consecration of the goods of L. Metellus by C. Atinius\r\n(131 B.C., Plin. l.c.) as an instance of “furor tribuni plebis, ductus ex\r\nnonnullis perveterum temporum exemplis.” P. Clodius (58 B.C.) consecrated\r\nthe goods of Cicero and of Gabinius the consul (ib. § 124).\r\n\r\n[724] _Lex Quinctia de aquaeductibus_ (Bruns _Fontes_) l. 20 “tum is\r\npraetor ... multa pignoribus cogito coerceto.”\r\n\r\n[725] Cic. _de Orat._ iii. 1, 4, “pignora caedere” or “concidere”; the\r\ndestruction was performed as an example “in conspectu populi Romani.”\r\n\r\n[726] _Auct. de Vir. Illustr._ 72, 6. Cf. the procedure of the consul\r\nServilius against the revolutionary praetor Caelius Rufus in 48 B.C. Dio\r\nCass. xlii. 23 τόν τε δίφρον αὑτοῦ συνέτριψεν.\r\n\r\n[727] Varro ap. Gell. xiii. 12 “vocationem (habent), ut consoles et\r\ncaeteri, qui habent imperium; prensionem, ut tribuni plebis et alii, qui\r\nhabent viatorem; neque vocationem neque prensionem, ut quaestores et\r\nceteri, qui neque lictorem habent neque viatorem. Qui vocationem habent,\r\nidem prendere, tenere, abducere possunt.”\r\n\r\n[728] p. 94.\r\n\r\n[729] See Varro ap. Gell. l.c.\r\n\r\n[730] Aediles were used in the trial of Coriolanus (Dionys. vii. 26,\r\nsee p. 98); Gracchus sent one of his _viatores_ to drag his colleague\r\nOctavius from the Rostra (Plut. _Ti. Gracch._ 12). Cf. Liv. xxv. 4 (case\r\nof Postumius 212 B.C.) “tribuni ... ni vades daret ... prehendi a viatore\r\n... jusserunt.”\r\n\r\n[731] Varro, as an antiquarian, refused to obey such a summons on the\r\nground of its illegality (Gell. xiii. 12.)\r\n\r\n[732] Donatus _ad Ter. Ad._ iv. 2, 9 “qui malam rem nuntiat, obnuntiat,\r\nqui bonam adnuntiat; nam proprie obnuntiare dicuntur augures, qui aliquid\r\nmali ominis scaevumque viderint.” Cf. Cicero _Phil._ ii. 33, 83; _de\r\nDiv._ i. 16, 29 (_dirarum obnuntiatio_).\r\n\r\n[733] The plebeian magistrates sometimes watched for such signs, for\r\npurposes of obstruction, and were then improperly said _servare de coelo_\r\n(Cic. _ad Att._ iv. 3, 3). The words are properly used only of the\r\n_spectio_. See Greenidge, “The Repeal of the Lex Aelia Fufia” in _Class.\r\nRev._ vii. p. 158.\r\n\r\n[734] p. 163.\r\n\r\n[735] Cic. _pro Sest._ 36, 78; Dio Cass. xxxviii. 13. To discuss, as has\r\nbeen done, whether the patrician magistrates’ _obnuntiatio_ was valid\r\nagainst the tribunes is to raise rather an idle question. The _lex Aelia\r\nFufia_ could not have artificially regulated religious belief, and the\r\nPlebs was as susceptible to _auspicia_ as the Populus (see p. 39).\r\n\r\n[736] Gell. xiii. 15; _minor_ here simply means “inferior to the consul.”\r\n\r\n[737] They regulated the precedence of the _comitia_ for elections and\r\nfor laws (Cic. _ad Att._ i. 16, 13).\r\n\r\n[738] Cic. _in Pis._ 4, 9; _de Prov. Con._ 19, 46; _in Vat._ 7, 18.\r\n\r\n[739] Cic. _Phil._ ii. 32, 80 and 38, 99; _ad Att._ iv. 9, 1; 16, 7, etc.\r\nSee _Class. Rev._ vii. p. 160.\r\n\r\n[740] The exercise of the _coercitio_ might of course be vetoed, and in\r\nthis case the prohibition was of no avail. See Liv. ix. 34 (n. 7).\r\n\r\n[741] p. 159.\r\n\r\n[742] Liv. xliii. 16 (169 B.C., P. Rutilius tr. pl.) “C. Claudio diem\r\ndixit, quod contionem ab se avocasset.”\r\n\r\n[743] ib. xxvii. 5 (210 B.C.). The consul declined to question the people\r\non the nomination of a dictator, “quod suae potestatis esset,” and\r\nforbade the praetor to do so.\r\n\r\n[744] p. 172.\r\n\r\n[745] Cf. the story in Suet. _Tib._ 2, “Etiam virgo vestalis fratrem\r\n(App. Claudius, consul 143 B.C.) injussu populi triumphantem, adscenso\r\nsimul curru, usque in Capitolium prosecuta est, ne vetare aut intercedere\r\nfas cuiquam tribunorum esset.”\r\n\r\n[746] Liv. ix. 33-34. P. Sempronius, tribune, attempted to compel App.\r\nClaudius, who was trying to prolong his censorship beyond eighteen\r\nmonths, to abdicate. He tried to imprison the censor but was resisted by\r\nthe veto of three colleagues.\r\n\r\n[747] _Auct. de vir. illustr._ 72, 6 (for the occasion see p. 171); the\r\nconsul “ne quis ad eum (praetorem) in jus ire edixit.” Dio Cass. xlii.\r\n23; amongst the other penalties imposed by Servilius Isauricus on Caelius\r\nRufus (see p. 171) was the transference of his functions to another\r\npraetor, τά τε προσήκοντα τῇ ἀρχῇ αὐτοῦ ἄλλῳ τῳ τῶν στρατηγῶν προσέταξε.\r\n\r\n[748] Cic. _in Verr._ iii. 58, 134 “quaestores, legates, praefectos,\r\ntribunos suos, multi missos fecerunt et de provincia decedere jusserunt,\r\nquod illorum culpa se minus commode audire arbitrarentur, aut quod\r\npeccare ipsos aliqua in re judicarent.”\r\n\r\n[749] Liv. iii. 27; vii. 9.\r\n\r\n[750] _C.I.L._ vi. n. 895.\r\n\r\n[751] Liv. iii. 3; Cic. _Phil._ v. 12, 31.\r\n\r\n[752] Liv. iii. 5; vi. 7; Cic. l.c.\r\n\r\n[753] Mommsen conjectures that, on the occasion of every public funeral\r\nin the forum, a short _justitium_ was declared (_Staatsr._ i. p. 251 n.\r\n4).\r\n\r\n[754] Liv. x. 21.\r\n\r\n[755] Cic. _de Har. Resp._ 26, 55 “justitium edici oportere,\r\njurisdictionem intermitti, claudi aerarium, judicia tolli.” Cf. Plut.\r\n_Ti. Gracch._ 10; Cic. _pro Plancio_ 14, 33.\r\n\r\n[756] Liv. vi 7.\r\n\r\n[757] Cic. _Brut._ 89, 304 “exercebatur una lege judicium Varia, ceteris\r\npropter bellum intermissis.”\r\n\r\n[758] p. 119.\r\n\r\n[759] Plut. _Ti. Gracch._ 10.\r\n\r\n[760] “(Feriae) imperativae sunt, quas consules vel praetores pro\r\narbitrio potestatis indicunt” (Macrob. _Saturn._ i. 16, 6).\r\n\r\n[761] e.g. by Livy (x. 37).\r\n\r\n[762] No instance of such a veto being exercised at Rome is known; but it\r\nis recognised in the municipal law of Salpensa (Bruns _Fontes_) c. 27.\r\n\r\n[763] Or _decretum_. The formal difference is slight; by the end of the\r\nRepublic _edictum_ is a general, _decretum_ a more special (and generally\r\njudicial) command.\r\n\r\n[764] Liv. iv. 55.\r\n\r\n[765] Caes. _Bell. Civ._ iii. 20 (Caelius Rufus) “tribunal suum juxta C.\r\nTreboni praetoris urbani sellam collocavit, et si quis appellavisset ...\r\nfore auxilio pollicebatur.” For the consequent necessity of the presence\r\nof the tribunes in Rome see p. 94.\r\n\r\n[766] Thus Verres, who was _praetor urbanus_, had his decisions vetoed by\r\nPiso, who was probably _praetor peregrinus_, in cases where Verres had\r\ndecided contrary to his own edict. Cic. _in Verr._ i. 46, 119; cf. Caes.\r\nl.c.\r\n\r\n[767] Of the four private-law speeches of Cicero, two, those for\r\nQuinctius and Tullius, show the request for tribunician interference with\r\nthe praetor’s jurisdiction. Cf. Cic. _Acad. Prior._ ii. 30, 97 “postulant\r\nut excipiantur haec inexplicabilia. Tribunum aliquem censeo adeant (_al._\r\nvideant); a me istam exceptionem nunquam impetrabunt.”\r\n\r\n[768] Liv. xxxiii. 42.\r\n\r\n[769] The tribunes promise “cognituros se de quo appellati essent” (Liv.\r\nxlii. 32).\r\n\r\n[770] Liv. xlii. 33.\r\n\r\n[771] Ascon. _in Milon._ p. 47.\r\n\r\n[772] p. 174.\r\n\r\n[773] Liv. iv. 50; xxv. 2.\r\n\r\n[774] Cic. _de Leg.

Consular intercession against the praetor was\r\nunnecessary, since the praetor did not usually summon the Senate while\r\nthe consul was at Rome.\r\n\r\n[784] Val. Max. ii. 2, 7 “Illud quoque memoria repetendum est, quod\r\ntribunis plebis intrare curiam non licebat, ante valvas autem positis\r\nsubselliis decreta patrum attentissima cura examinabant, ut, si qua\r\nex eis improbassent, rata esse non sinerent. Itaque veteribus senatus\r\nconsultis C. litera subscribi solebat, eaque nota significabatur illa\r\ntribunos quoque censuisse.” In _S.C.C._ translated into Greek it appears\r\nas ἔδοξεν (_S.C.C. de Thisbaeis_, Bruns _Fontes_). In those given in\r\nCic. _ad Fam._ viii. 8, 6, the letters “i. n.” (sometimes interpreted\r\n“intercessit nemo”) are probably a corruption for _censuere_.\r\n\r\n[785] Momms. _Staatsr._ i. p. 282 n. 7; combated by Willems _Le Sénat_ p.\r\n200 n. 2.\r\n\r\n[786] Liv. xxvi. 26; xxx. 40; cf. xlii. 10 “Popillius ... prae se ferens\r\nsi quid decernerent, intercessurum, collegam deterruit.”\r\n\r\n[787] Val.

Con._ 8, 17; _pro Domo_ 9, 24. Intercession in\r\njurisdiction and administration is sometimes forbidden in municipal laws:\r\n_Lex Rubria_ i. 50; _Lex Ursonensis_ c. 72 (Bruns _Fontes_).\r\n\r\n[792] Varro ap. Gell. xiii. 13 “Qui potestatem neque vocationis populi\r\nviritim habent neque prensionis, eos magistratus a privato in jus quoque\r\nvocari est potestas.” The context shows that they were practically as\r\nexempt as the higher magistrates.\r\n\r\n[793] Nothing is known of the early history of _peculatus_. The word\r\nitself, “the misappropriation of cattle,” which had been collected as\r\nfines, shows the antiquity of the offence described by Varro (_L.L._\r\nv. 95) as _peculatus publicus_. For the early procedure see Mommsen\r\n_Strafrecht_ p. 768.\r\n\r\n[794] In Polybius’ time bribery was a capital offence at Rome (Polyb. vi\r\n56).\r\n\r\n[795] Polyb. vi. 14. The people are often judges of money penalties,\r\nwhen the offence can be valued in money, καὶ μάλιστα τοὺς τὰς ἐπιφανεῖς\r\nἐσχηκότας ἀρχάς, θανάτου δὲ κρίνει μόνος. Cf. c. 15. The greatest source\r\nof the power of the people is that ἀποτιθεμένους τὴν ἀρχὴν ἐν τούτῳ δεῖ\r\nτὰς εὐθύνας ὑπέχειν τῶν πεπραγμένων.\r\n\r\n[796] Liv. xxiv. 43 (214 B.C., the tribune Metellus prosecutes the\r\ncensors Furius and Atilius) “Sed novem tribunorum auxilio vetiti causam\r\nin magistratu dicere dimissique fuerant”; Suet. _Caes._ 23 (Caesar on\r\nleaving for Gaul) “a L. Antistio, tr. pl., postulatus, appellato demum\r\ncollegio, obtinuit, cum reipublicae causa abesset, reus ne fieret.” In\r\nthe case of the trial of the censors of 169 B.C. (Liv. xliii 16) the\r\naccused agree to be put on their trial during their tenure of office.\r\n\r\n[797] Liv. xxix. 22 (204 B.C.). Pleminius and his colleagues were\r\n“producti ad populum ab tribunis.”\r\n\r\n[798] ib. vi. 1 “Q. Fabio ... ab Cn.

The instance, though typical,\r\nis not historic.\r\n\r\n[803] Liv. xliii. 7, 8 (170 B.C.).\r\n\r\n[804] Tac. _Ann._ xi. 22 “apud majores ... cunctis civium, si bonis\r\nartibus fiderent, licitum petere magistratus.”\r\n\r\n[805] Festus p. 231 “plebeium magistratum neminem capere licet, nisi qui\r\nex plebe est.” Cf. Suet. _Aug._ 10.\r\n\r\n[806] This seems shown by Suet. _Claud._ 24 (see p. 135).\r\n\r\n[807] Momms. _Staatsr._ i. p. 488. Exceptional elections of the sons of\r\nfreedmen are found in 304 B.C. (Liv. ix. 46, Cn. Flavius (see p. 185) as\r\naedile) and in the year 100 B.C.

Villio tr. pl.,\r\nquot annos nati quemque magistratum peterent caperentque.” It probably\r\naccepted the age of twenty-eight for the quaestorship; the minimum age\r\nfor the consulship in the time of Cicero was forty-three (_Phil._ v. 17,\r\n48); that for the praetorship is quite unknown; thirty-five and forty\r\nhave been conjectured.\r\n\r\n[820] Cic. _ad Fam._ x. 25, 2 “non est annus hic tibi destinatus,\r\nut, si aedilis fuisses, post biennium tuus annus esset” (i.e. for\r\nelection to the praetorship). To be elected in the earliest year, when\r\none is qualified by the interval, is to attain a magistracy “anno\r\nsibi destinato” (l.c.) or “suo anno” (Cic. _pro Mil._ 9, 24). Momms.\r\n_Staatsr._ i. pp. 527, 529. The principle of at least one year’s interval\r\nseems to have applied to the transition from plebeian to patrician\r\nmagistracies in the form that candidature during the holding of any\r\noffice was forbidden (Momms. _Staatsr._ i. p. 533).\r\n\r\n[821] App. B.C. i. 100 καὶ στρατηγεῖν ἀπεῖπε πρὶν ταμιεῦσαι καὶ ὑπατεύειν\r\nπρὶν στρατηγῆσαι, καὶ τὴν ἀρχὴν τὴν αὐτὴν αὖθις ἄρχειν ἐκώλυσε πρὶν ἒτη\r\nδέκα διαγενέσθαι.\r\n\r\n[822] Cic. _ad Fam._ xvi. 12, 3 “se praesentem trinum nundinum\r\npetiturum”; Sallust, _Cat._ 18 “post paulo Catilina pecuniarum\r\nrepetundarum reus prohibitus erat consulatum petere, quod intra legitimos\r\ndies profiteri nequiverit.” The interval was probably twenty-four days.\r\nSee the section on the _comitia_.\r\n\r\n[823] Plut. _Aem. Paul._ 3; _Sull._ 5.\r\n\r\n[824] Cic. _de Leg. Agr._ ii. 9, 24 (63 B.C.) “praesentem profiteri\r\njubet, quod nulla alia in lege unquam fuit, ne in iis quidem\r\nmagistratibus quorum certus ordo est”; Suet. _Caes._ 18 (60 B.C.) “cum\r\nedictis jam comitiis ratio ejus haberi non posset ... et ambienti ut\r\nlegibus solveretur multi contradicerent, coactus est triumphum, ne\r\nconsulatu excluderetur, dimittere.” Cf. Plut. _Caes._ 13.\r\n\r\n[825] Dio Cass. xl. 56 (Pompeius) τὸν περὶ τῶν ἀρχαιρεσιῶν νόμον τὸν\r\nκελεύοντα τοὺς ἀρχήν τινα ἐπαγγέλλοντας ἐς τὴν ἐκκλησίαν πάντως ἁπαντᾷν,\r\nὥστε μηδένα ἀπόντα αἱρεῖσθαι, παρημελημένον πῶς ἀνενεώσατο.\r\n\r\n[826] Hence their association with _sequestres_—the agents in whose hands\r\nthe candidate deposited money. Cic. _pro Planc._ 18, 19; Q. Cic. _de Pet.\r\nCons._ 14, 57.\r\n\r\n[827] _Lex Jul. Munic._ l. 132 “neve quis ejus rationem comitieis\r\nconciliove [habeto, neive quis quem, sei adversus ea comitieis\r\nconciliove] creatum est, renuntiato.” In 67 B.C. the consul Piso,\r\nquestioned “Palicanum num suffragiis populi consulem creatum\r\nrenuntiaturus esset,” answered “non renuntiabo” (Val. Max. iii. 8, 3).\r\n\r\n[828] p. 47.\r\n\r\n[829] Mommsen (_Staatsr._ i. p. 599) places this change in 222 B.C. Liv.\r\nxxxi. 5, etc.\r\n\r\n[830] _Fasti Praenestini_ (_C.I.L._ i. p. 364) “[ann]us nov[us incipit],\r\nquia eo die mag[istratus] ineunt: quod coepit [p. R.] c. a.

Campana Lex (of the consul\r\nCaesar in 59 B.C.) execrationem in contione candidatorum.”\r\n\r\n[835] Liv. xxxi. 50; if we may argue from municipal law (_Lex Salpens._\r\nc. 26), omission to take it due to mere neglect was visited in the first\r\ninstance by a fine.\r\n\r\n[836] Liv. l.c.\r\n\r\n[837] Cic. _ad Fam._ v. 2, 7; _pro Sulla_ 11, 34; _in Pison._ 3, 6; _pro\r\nDomo_ 35, 94. Cicero, at the close of 63, varied the oath by swearing\r\nthat he had saved the state.\r\n\r\n[838] p. 45.\r\n\r\n[839] Liv. v. 41.\r\n\r\n[840] The dagger is mentioned more frequently than the sword (_gladius_)\r\nas the distinctive sign of military power. Momms. _Staatsr._ i. p. 434 n.\r\n1.\r\n\r\n[841] Hence such phrases as _decedere via_, _descendere equo_, _adsurgere\r\nsella_, _caput aperire_. The senators were in the habit of rising from\r\ntheir seats when the consul entered the Curia (Cic. _in Pis._ 12, 26).\r\n\r\n[842] A decree of the augurs in 426 B.C. declared the consular tribunes\r\ncapable of this nomination (Liv. iv. 31).\r\n\r\n[843] p. 165.\r\n\r\n[844] Liv. viii. 12 “Aemilius, cujus tum fasces erant, collegam\r\ndictatorem dixit”; iv. 26 “Sors, ut dictatorem diceret (nam ne id quidem\r\ninter collegas convenerat) T. Quinctio evenit”; iv. 21 “Verginius, dum\r\ncollegam consuleret, moratus, permittente eo, nocte dictatorem dixit.”\r\n\r\n[845] Liv. iv. 17 “senatus ... dictatorem dici Mam. Aemilium jussit”;\r\nvii. 12 “dictatorem dici C. Sulpicium placuit. Consul ad id adcitus C.\r\nPlautius dixit.”\r\n\r\n[846] ib. xxii. 57 (216 B.C.) “dictator ex auctoritate patrum dictus M.\r\nJunius.”\r\n\r\n[847] ib. _Ep._ 19; Suet. _Tib._ 2 (the enforced abdication of Claudius\r\nGlicia, nominated by Claudius Pulcher). In Liv. iv. 26 the _coercitio_ of\r\nthe tribune is represented as employed against the consuls who disobey.\r\n\r\n[848] Mommsen in _C.I.L._ i. p. 557.\r\n\r\n[849] Liv. xxvii 5 (210 B.C., on the proposal of the consul to nominate\r\na dictator in Sicily) “patres extra Romanum agrum (eum autem in Italia\r\nterminari) negabant dictatorem dici posse.”\r\n\r\n[850] ib. ix. 38-39.\r\n\r\n[851] Polyb. iii. 87; but, as a rule, he was preceded by only twelve\r\nwithin the walls (Liv. _Ep._ 89 “Sulla, dictator factus, quod nemo umquam\r\nfecerat, cum fascibus viginti quatuor processit”).\r\n\r\n[852] Liv. ii. 18 “Creato dictatore primum Romae, postquam praeferri\r\nsecures viderunt, magnus plebem metus incessit.”\r\n\r\n[853] p. 85.\r\n\r\n[854] e.g. the dictator named by Livy (ix. 26) as “quaestionibus\r\nexercendis” (314) is mentioned in the _Fast. Capitol._ as “rei gerundae\r\ncausa” (Momms. _Staatsr._ ii. p. 157 n. 2); a dictator “seditionis\r\nsedandae et rei gerundae causa” is found in the _Fasti_ for 368.\r\n\r\n[855] Liv. vii. 24 “qui aegris consulibus comitia haberet.” Cf. c. 26\r\n(absence of consuls in the field) and ix. 7.\r\n\r\n[856] ib. xxiii. 22. In 216 B.C. M. Fabius Buteo was appointed dictator\r\n“qui senatum legeret.”\r\n\r\n[857] ib. viii. 40.\r\n\r\n[858] ib. vii. 28 (for establishment of _feriae_ on the occasion of\r\na _prodigium_); “dictator Latinarum feriarum causa” in _Fast. Cap._\r\n(_C.I.L._ i. p. 434) for the year 257 B.C.\r\n\r\n[859] The first instance was on the occasion of the great pestilence in\r\n363 B.C. (Liv. vii. 3 “Lex vetusta est ... ut, qui praetor maximus sit,\r\nIdibus Septembribus clavum pangat”). Cf. Fest. p. 56.\r\n\r\n[860] Cic. _de Off._ iii. 31, 112 (see p. 183); cf. Liv. vii. 3. L.\r\nManlius, appointed “clavi figendi causa,” acted “perinde ac reipublicae\r\ngerendae ... gratia creatus esset,” and was forced to abdicate.\r\n\r\n[861] p. 84.\r\n\r\n[862] This is Mommsen’s interpretation (_Staatsr._ ii. p. 160 n. 4)\r\nof Liv. xxx. 39. C. Servilius Geminus had been appointed dictator\r\n_comitiorum causa_—“Saepe comitia indicta perfici tempestates\r\nprohibuerunt. Itaque, cum prid. Id. Mart. veteres magistratus abissent,\r\nnovi subfecti non essent, respublica sine curulibus magistratibus erat.”\r\n\r\n[863] Liv. iv. 41. The consul is here said “auspicio dictatoris res\r\ngerere.”\r\n\r\n[864] ib. ii. 32 “quamquam per dictatorem dilectus habitus esset, tamen,\r\nquoniam in consulum verba jurassent, sacramento teneri militem rati.”\r\n\r\n[865] This view has led to the exaggerated statement of Polybius (iii.\r\n87) that, on the establishment of a dictator, παραχρῆμα διαλύεσθαι\r\nσυμβαίνει πάσας τὰς ἀρχὰς ἐν τῇ Ῥώμῃ πλὴν τῶν δημάρχων: which has been\r\ncopied by later Greek writers.\r\n\r\n[866] This is clearly shown by the attitude of the dictator L. Papirius\r\nCursor when pursuing his disobedient master of the horse (Liv. viii.\r\n34). The dictator hopes that the veto will not be employed (“optare ne\r\npotestas tribunicia, inviolata ipsa, violet intercessione sua Romanum\r\nimperium”). Zonaras expresses the fact and not the law (vii. 13 οὔτ’\r\nἐγκαλέσαι τις αὐτῷ οὔτ’ ἐναντίον τι διαπράξασθαι ἴσχυεν οὐδὲ οἱ δήμαρχοι).\r\n\r\n[867] Zonar. vii. 13 οὔτε ἐκ τῶν δημοσίων χρημάτων ἀναλῶσαι τι ἐξῆν αὐτῷ,\r\nεἰ μὴ ἐψηφίσθη.\r\n\r\n[868] Liv. _Ep._ 19 (249 B.C.) “Atilius Calatinus primus dictator extra\r\nItaliam exercitum duxit”; Dio Cass. xxxvi. 17 (the dictatorship was\r\nlimited to Italy) καὶ οὐκ ἂν εὑρεθείη δικτάτωρ οὐδεὶς ἄλλοσε, πλὴν ἑνὸς\r\nἐς Σικελίαν, καὶ ταῦτα μηδὲν πράξαντος, αἱρεθείς.\r\n\r\n[869] Festus p. 198 “optima lex in magistro populi faciendo, qui vulgo\r\nDictator appellator, quam plenissimum posset jus ejus esse significabatur\r\n... postquam vero provocatio ab eo magistratu ad populum data est, quae\r\nante non erat, desitum est adici ‘ut optima lege,’ ut pote imminuto jure\r\npriorum magistrorum.”\r\n\r\n[870] p. 168. It could not have been a consequence of the\r\nValerio-Horatian laws of 449 B.C. (see p. 109).\r\n\r\n[871] Liv. xxii. 8.\r\n\r\n[872] Livy (xxii. 25) describes it as a _rogatio_ “de aequando magistri\r\nequitum et dictatoris jure.” Cf. c. 26 “de aequato imperio.”\r\n\r\n[873] Liv. xxii. 57, M. Junius Pera.\r\n\r\n[874] _Fast. Capitol._\r\n\r\n[875] Sulla was nominated by an interrex (though his powers were\r\nconferred by law), Caesar by a praetor. Plutarch (_Marc._ 24) says that\r\nthe praetor could nominate the dictator, a proceeding which is declared\r\nby Cicero to be wholly unconstitutional, _ad Att._ ix. 15, 2 (49 B.C.)\r\n“volet (Caesar) ... vel ut consules roget praetor vel dictatorem dicat,\r\nquorum neutrum jus est. Etsi si Sulla potuit efficere, ab interrege ut\r\ndictator diceretur, cur hic non possit?” The nomination of Caesar was\r\nregular in so far as a special _lex_ was passed which empowered the\r\npraetor to nominate (Caes. B.C. ii. 21; Dio Cass. xli. 36).\r\n\r\n[876] An exception is found in 216 B.C. M. Fab. Buteo was appointed\r\n“dictator sine mag. eq. senatus legendi causa” (see p. 193).\r\n\r\n[877] In the single case of the election of a dictator, the _magister\r\nequitum_ was also elected (Liv. xxii. 8).\r\n\r\n[878] Dio Cass. xlii. 27; Antonius, as Caesar’s _magister equitum_, had\r\nsix lictors.\r\n\r\n[879] Cic. _de Leg._ iii. 3, 9 “equitatumque qui regat, habeto pari jure\r\ncum eo, quicumque erit juris disceptator.”\r\n\r\n[880] Pompon. in _Dig._ 1, 2, 2, 19 “et his dictatoribus magistri equitum\r\ninjungebantur sic, quo modo regibus tribuni celerum: ... magistratus\r\ntamen habebantur legitimi.”\r\n\r\n[881] Liv. iv. 34 “jussoque magistro equitum abdicare se magistratu, ipse\r\ndeinde abdicat.”\r\n\r\n[882] Liv. ix. 38 “Papirius C. Junium Bubulcum magistrum equitum dixit:\r\natque ei, legem curiatam de imperio ferenti, triste omen diem diffidit.”\r\n\r\n[883] Cic. _de Leg._ iii. 4, 10; see p. 160.\r\n\r\n[884] Liv. viii. 32 sq.; cf. xxii. 27 “in ... civitate, in qua magistri\r\nequitum virgas ac secures dictatoris tremere atque horrere soliti sint.”\r\n\r\n[885] ib. iv. 27 “relictoque (at Rome) L. Julio magistro equitum ad\r\nsubita belli ministeria.”\r\n\r\n[886] ib. ii. 18; Dio Cass. xlii. 21 (Caesar τὸν Ἀντώνιον, μηδ’\r\nἐστρατηγηκότα, ἵππαρχον προσελόμενος).\r\n\r\n[887] Dionys. ii. 6 τῶν δὲ παρόντων τινὲς ὀρνιθοσκόπων μισθὸν ἐκ τοῦ\r\nδημοσίου φερόμενοι.\r\n\r\n[888] Cic. _post Red. ad Quir._ 5, 11.

Licinius praetor consuluit senatum quem quaerere ea\r\nrogatione vellet. Patres ipsum eum quaerere jusserunt.”\r\n\r\n[901] Cic. _de Rep._ iii. 18, 28 (of the year 136 B.C.) “Consul ego\r\nquaesivi, cum vos mihi essetis in consilio, de Numantino foedere.”\r\nMommsen (_Staatsr._ ii. p. 112 n. 3) thinks that the _consilium_ was\r\nformed by the Fetiales (cf. Cic. _de Leg._ ii. 9, 21).\r\n\r\n[902] For the question whether the _pomerium_ or the first milestone was\r\nthe limit of the full _imperium_ see p. 79.\r\n\r\n[903] For the rotation of the _imperium_ before Cannae (216 B.C.) see\r\nPolyb. iii. 110, Liv. xxii. 41.\r\n\r\n[904] Liv. xxii. 27 “Ita (Fabius, after the appointment of Minucius as\r\nhis colleague in 217 B.C.) obtinuit uti legiones, sicut consulibus mos\r\nesset, inter se dividerent.”\r\n\r\n[905] ib. xxx. 1 (203 B.C.) “censuerunt patres, ut consules inter se\r\ncompararent sortirenturve, uter Bruttios adversus Hannibalem, uter\r\nEtruriam ac Ligures provinciam haberet.”\r\n\r\n[906] Italy and Macedonia (ib. xxxii. 8, xlii. 31, xliii. 12), Italy and\r\nGreece (xxxvii. 1).\r\n\r\n[907] Italia and some foreign country are still consular _provinciae_ in\r\n112 and 111 B.C. (Sall. _Jug._ 27, 43). When a consul was appointed to\r\none of the old praetorian provinces, he did not supplant the praetor but\r\ncommanded with and over him.\r\n\r\n[908] Liv. xxx. 1 “ut consules inter se compararent sortirenturve.” Cf.\r\nib. xxxii. 8, xxxvii. 1, and the other passages cited in note 3.\r\n\r\n[909] ib. viii. 16; cf. Cic. _pro Domo_ 9, 24. In 205 B.C. Scipio was\r\ngiven Sicilia _extra sortem_ because his colleague was _pontifex maximus_\r\n(Liv. xxviii. 38).\r\n\r\n[910] Liv. xxi. 17 (218 B.C.) “nominatae jam antea consulibus provinciae\r\nerant; tum sortiri jussi.” Cf. ib. xxviii. 38.\r\n\r\n[911] Sall. _Jug._ 27; Cic. _pro Domo_ 9, 24.\r\n\r\n[912] Cic. _ad Att._ viii. 15, 3 “consules quibus more majorum concessum\r\nest vel omnes adire provincias.” Lucullus went as consul to Asia in 74\r\nB.C.\r\n\r\n[913] p. 153.\r\n\r\n[914] That staunch conservative Q. Catulus was wont to reflect with\r\npleasure “non saepe unum consulem improbum, duos vero nunquam, excepto\r\nillo Cinnano tempore, fuisse” (Cic. _post Red. in Sen._ 4, 9). By\r\n_improbi_ Catulus meant “radicals.”\r\n\r\n[915] The consul was the “legitimus tutor” of the state (Cic. _post Red.\r\nad Quir._ 5, 11) and “quasi parens bonus aut tutor fidelis” (_de Or._\r\niii. 1, 3).\r\n\r\n[916] p. 120.\r\n\r\n[917] Two praetors for Sicily and Sardinia (Liv. _Ep._ xx.), two more for\r\nthe Spanish provinces (Liv. xxxii. 27). For the _lex Baebia_ see Liv. xl.\r\n44. For the restoration of the number six see Vell. ii. 16. Pomponius\r\nsays that four were added by Sulla (_Dig._ 1, 2, 2, 32), but eight are\r\nfound in 47 B.C. (Dio Cass. xlii. 51).\r\n\r\n[918] The praetor had a right to six lictors (στρατηγὸς ἑξαπέλεκυς, App.\r\n_Syr._ 15; cf. Polyb. iii. 40) and appears with the full number in the\r\nprovince (Cic. _in Verr._ v. 54, 142 “sex lictores circumsistunt”); but,\r\nin the exercise of his jurisdiction within the city, he employed, or was\r\nallowed, only two (Censorinus _de Die Nat._ 24, 3; cf. Cic. _de Leg.\r\nAgr._ ii. 34, 93).\r\n\r\n[919] _Praetor urbanus_ (_S. C. de Bacch._ ll. 5, 8, 17, 21), _praetor\r\nqui inter cives jus dicet_ (_lex Agraria_ of 111 B.C.), _provincia_\r\nor _sors urbana_ (Liv. xxiv. 9, xxv. 3, xxvii. 7, xxviii. 10, xxix.\r\n13), jurisdictio urbana (ib. xxxii. 28, xlii. 31)—_praetor qui inter\r\nperegrinos jus dicet_ (_lex Acil._ ll. 12 and 89; _lex Jul.

Both these praetors, as distinct\r\nfrom those in foreign command, are said to have _urbanae provinciae_ (ib.\r\nxliii. 11), _provincia urbana_ (xxxii. 1), _jurisdictio urbana_ (xxv. 41,\r\nxxx. 1).\r\n\r\n[920] p. 197.\r\n\r\n[921] App. _B.

In 197 B.C., on the news of troubles in Spain, “decreverunt\r\npatres ut, comitiis praetorum perfectis, cui praetori provincia Hispania\r\nobvenisset, is primo quoque tempore de bello Hispaniae ad senatum\r\nreferret” (ib. xxxiii. 21).\r\n\r\n[930] The _provinciae_ assigned to the four praetors are _urbana_,\r\n_peregrina_, Sicilia, Sardinia (ib. xxviii. 10), to the six praetors the\r\nsame with the addition of the two Spains (ib. xxxii. 28, xl. 1).\r\n\r\n[931] ib. xxv. 3 (212 B.C.) “Et praetores provincias sortiti sunt; P.\r\nCornelius Sulla urbanam et peregrinam, quae duorum ante sors fuerat.” Cf.\r\nib. xxxvii. 50 (189 B.C.).\r\n\r\n[932] ib. xxix. 13 (204 B.C.) “M.

Fulvio extra ordinem urbana provincia esset.”\r\n\r\n[934] Gaius _Inst._ iv. 30 “per legem Aebutiam et duas Julias sublatae\r\nsunt istae legis actiones; effectumque est ut per concepta verba, id est,\r\nper formulas, litigaremus”; Gell. xvi. 10, 8 “cum ... omnis ... illa\r\nduodecim tabularum antiquitas nisi in legis actionibus centumviralium\r\ncausarum lege Aebutia lata consopita sit.”\r\n\r\n[935] Marcian in _Dig._ 1, 1, 8 “nam et ipsum jus honorarium viva vox est\r\njuris civilis.”\r\n\r\n[936] Cic. _de Leg._ i. 5, 17 “Non ergo a praetoris edicto, ut plerique\r\nnunc, neque a XII Tabulis, ut superiores ... hauriendam juris disciplinam\r\nputas.” Cf. _de Leg._ ii. 23, 59 “discebamus enim pueri XII, ut carmen\r\nnecessarium: quas jam nemo discit.”\r\n\r\n[937] Papinian in _Dig._ 1, 1, 7, 1 “jus praetorium est, quod praetores\r\nintroduxerunt adjuvandi vel supplendi vel corrigendi juris civilis gratia\r\npropter utilitatem publicam.”\r\n\r\n[938] For the edict as the expression of customary law see Cic. _de\r\nInvent._ ii. 22, 67 “Consuetudine autem jus esse putatur id, quod\r\nvoluntate omnium sine lege vetustas comprobarit.... Quo in genere et alia\r\nsunt multa et eorum multo maxima pars, quae praetores edicere consuerunt.”\r\n\r\n[939] Cic. _in Verr._ i. 42, 109 “qui plurimum tribuunt edicto, praetoris\r\nedictum legem annuam dicunt esse.”\r\n\r\n[940] Ascon. _in Cornel._ p. 58; Cic. _in Verr._ i. 44, 114. _Perpetuum_\r\nmeans “continuous,” _tralaticium_ “transmitted.”\r\n\r\n[941] Cic. _in Verr._ i. 46, 119. Cf. p. 178.\r\n\r\n[942] Ascon. _in Cornel._ p. 58 “Aliam deinde legem Cornelius, ... tulit,\r\nut praetores ex edictis suis perpetuis jus dicerent, quae res ... gratiam\r\nambitiosis praetoribus, qui varie jus dicere assueverant, sustulit.” Cf.\r\nDio Cass. xxxvi. 23.\r\n\r\n[943] p. 202.\r\n\r\n[944] Cic. _in Verr._ Act. i. 8, 21; _pro Mur._ 20, 42. The fullest\r\naccount that we possess of the distribution of such functions amongst the\r\nmembers of the college refers to the year 66 B.C. (ib. _pro Cluent._ 53,\r\n147; Ascon. _in Cornel._ p. 59).\r\n\r\n[945] e.g. the _lex Cornelia de sicariis et veneficis_ took cognisance\r\nof murder, poisoning, and arson, that _de falsis_ of the forgery of\r\ndocuments and of wills as well as of coining.\r\n\r\n[946] After the _sortitio_ for 62 B.C. the praetor Q. Metellus Celer was\r\ngiven the province of Cisalpine Gaul (Cic. _ad Fam._ v. 2, 3, and 4).\r\nDuring his praetorship (63 B.C.) he had been summoned to a command in\r\nnorthern Italy.\r\n\r\n[947] Cic. _de Leg._ iii. 3, 7 “Suntoque aediles, curatores urbis,\r\nannonae ludorumque sollemnium: ollisque ad honoris amplioris gradum is\r\nprimus ascensus esto.” Cf. _lex Jul.

He takes “cum tabernariis pugnarem”\r\n(Cic. _ad Fam._ viii. 6, 4, cited p. 209) in this sense.\r\n\r\n[969] _Dig._ 21, 1, 1; Gell. iv. 2.\r\n\r\n[970] Cic. _in Verr._ v. 14, 36.\r\n\r\n[971] Liv. x. 47; xxvii. 6.

Here by a decree of the Senate the\r\nMegalesia are celebrated by the plebeian aediles.\r\n\r\n[974] When during the first Punic war Clodia uttered her ill-omened wish\r\nabout the Roman people, “C. Fundanius et Ti. Sempronius, aediles plebei,\r\nmultam dixerunt ei aeris gravis viginti quinque milia” (Gell. x. 6). Cf.\r\nSuet. _Tib._ 2.\r\n\r\n[975] Cicero promises, as aedile, to prosecute those “qui aut deponere\r\naut accipere aut recipere aut pollicere aut sequestres aut interpretes\r\ncorrumpendi judicii solent esse” (_in Verr._ Act. i. 12, 36).\r\n\r\n[976] An instance is furnished by Clodius’ prosecution of Milo in 56 B.C.\r\n(Cic. _pro Sest._ 44, 95; _ad Q. fr._ 2, 3). A prosecution by the aedile\r\nin defence of his own dignity or person is an outcome of his _coercitio_.\r\nAn instance is furnished by Gell. iv. 14.\r\n\r\n[977] Liv. viii. 22; xxv. 2.\r\n\r\n[978] ib. xxxv. 41.\r\n\r\n[979] ib. xxxviii. 35.

Gracchus served as quaestor for three years; one was spent in\r\nRome and two in Sardinia (Plut. _C. Gracch._ 2).\r\n\r\n[988] Cic. _in Verr._ Act. i. 4, 11 “quaestura primus gradus honoris.”\r\n\r\n[989] ib. i. 13, 34 “quaestor ex senatus consulto provinciam sortitus es.”\r\n\r\n[990] Liv. xxx. 33 “Laelium, cujus ... eo anno quaestoris extra sortem ex\r\nsenatusconsulto opera utebatur” (Scipio in 202 B.C.); Cic. _ad Att._ vi.\r\n6, 4 “Pompeius ... Q. Cassium sine sorte delegit, Caesar Antonium; ego\r\nsorte datum offenderem?”\r\n\r\n[991] The first trace of a _quaestio de sicariis_ is in 142 B.C. (Cic.\r\n_de Fin._ ii. 16, 54).\r\n\r\n[992] Polyb. xxiv. 9_a_, 1.\r\n\r\n[993] Liv. iii. 69 “signa ... a quaestoribus ex aerario prompta delataque\r\nin campum.”\r\n\r\n[994] Cic. _de Leg._ iii. 20, 46.\r\n\r\n[995] Liv. xxxix. 4. It was the duty of the quaestors to see that they\r\nwere genuine. Cato the younger required the oath of the consuls that a\r\ncertain decree had been passed (Plut. _Cat. Min._ 17).\r\n\r\n[996] Cic. _Phil._ v. 5, 15.\r\n\r\n[997] ib. _in Verr._ iii. 79, 183 “eorum hominum (the _scribae_ of the\r\nquaestors) fidei tabulae publicae periculaque magistratuum committuntur.”\r\n\r\n[998] The security was given to the _aerarium_ (“subsignare apud\r\naerarium” Cic. _pro Flacco_ 32, 80); hence the money was probably paid\r\ninto that treasury.\r\n\r\n[999] Liv. xxxviii. 58 “Hostilius et Furius damnati (for _peculatus_ in\r\n187 B.C.) praedes eodem die quaestoribus urbanis dederunt.” In the _lex\r\nAcil. Rep._ (l. 57) it is said of the man convicted “q(uaestori) praedes\r\nfacito det.”\r\n\r\n[1000] Plaut. _Capt._ i. 2, 111; ii. 3, 453.\r\n\r\n[1001] Hygin. _de Cond. Agr._ p. 115.\r\n\r\n[1002] _Auct. ad Herenn._ i. 12, 21 “Cum L. Saturninus legem frumentariam\r\nde semissibus et trientibus laturus esset, Q. Caepio, qui per id temporis\r\nquaestor urbanus erat, docuit senatum aerarium pati non posse tantam\r\nlargitionem.”\r\n\r\n[1003] p. 117.\r\n\r\n[1004] p. 213. If the quaestor was lacking through death or any other\r\ncause, the governor appointed one of his _legati_ as _pro quaestore_\r\n(Cic. _in Verr._ i. 36, 90).\r\n\r\n[1005] Cic. _pro Planc._ 11, 28 “morem ilium majorum qui praescribit in\r\nparentum loco quaestoribus suis praetores esse oportere.”\r\n\r\n[1006] ib. _in Verr._ i. 15, 40 “Tu, cum quaestor ad exercitum missus\r\nsis, custos non solum pecuniae sed etiam consulis, particeps omnium rerum\r\nconsiliorumque fueris.”\r\n\r\n[1007] Lydus _de Mag._ i. 27 κρινάντων Ῥωμαίων πολεμεῖν τοῖς συμμαχήσασι\r\nΠύρρῳ τῷ Ἠπειρὼτῃ κατεσκευάσθη στόλος καὶ προεβλήθησαν οἱ καλοὺμενοι\r\nκλασσικοὶ (οἱονεὶ ναυάρχαι) τῷ ἀριθμῷ δυοκαίδεκα κυαίστωρες. Lydus may be\r\nright about the original number, although it has been sometimes thought a\r\nconfused reminiscence of the raising of the number from four to eight.\r\n\r\n[1008] Vell. ii. 94; cf. Cic. _pro Mur._ 8, 18 “tu illam (provinciam\r\nhabuisti), cui, cum quaestores sortiuntur, etiam acclamari solet,\r\nOstiensem non tam gratiosam et illustrem quam negotiosam et molestam.”\r\n\r\n[1009] Tac. _Ann._ iv. 27. In 24 A.D. a rising near Brundisium was\r\nrepressed by “Curtius Lupus quaestor, cui provincia vetere ex more calles\r\nevenerant.” Mommsen (_Staatsr._ ii. p. 571), following Lipsius, would\r\nread Cales, the oldest Latin colony in Campania, and therefore supposes\r\nthat this quaestor’s functions extended over the whole of South Italy.\r\nThe woods and forests was the _provincia_ which the Senate destined for\r\nCaesar as proconsul (Suet. _Caes._ 19 “opera optimatibus data est ut\r\nprovinciae futuris consulibus minimi negotii, id est, silvae callesque,\r\ndecernerentur”).\r\n\r\n[1010] Plut. _Sert._ 4.\r\n\r\n[1011] The last to remain were the Gallic and Ostian, which, as Italian\r\n_provinciae_, were abolished by the Emperor Claudius in 44 A.D. (Suet.\r\n_Claud._ 24).\r\n\r\n[1012] So Sertorius, as Gallic quaestor in the Marsic war, was instructed\r\nστρατιώτας ... καταλέγειν καὶ ὅπλα ποιεῖσθται (Plut. _Sert._ 4).\r\n\r\n[1013] Cicero speaks of Vatinius, when holding this post, being sent to\r\nPuteoli on some other business (_in Vat._ 5, 12), but this does not show\r\nthat he was holding an Italian quaestorship. See Momms. _Staatsr._ ii. p.\r\n573 n. 3.\r\n\r\n[1014] Liv. iv. 8; see p. 115.\r\n\r\n[1015] ib. vii. 22 (C. Marcius Rutilus); cf. x. 8.\r\n\r\n[1016] ib. viii. 12 “ut alter utique ex plebe, cum eo [ventum sit] ut\r\nutrumque plebeium fieri liceret, censor crearetur.” Madvig and Mommsen\r\nwould omit “ventum sit,” and so make the Publilian law open both places\r\nin the college to Plebeians.\r\n\r\n[1017] ib. _Ep._ lix. “Q. Pompeius Q. Metellus tunc primum utrique ex\r\nplebe facti censores lustrum condiderunt.”\r\n\r\n[1018] Messala ap. Gell. xiii. 15, 4.\r\n\r\n[1019] Cic. _de Leg. Agr._ ii 11, 26 “majores de singulis magistratibus\r\nbis vos sententiam ferre voluerunt: nam cum centuriata lex censoribus\r\nferebatur, cum curiata ceteris patriciis magistratibus, tum iterum de\r\neisdem judicabatur.”\r\n\r\n[1020] Messala ap. Gell. xiii. 15.\r\n\r\n[1021] Polybius (vi. 53) says that the _imago_ of the censor at a funeral\r\nwas clad in purple. As all the _insignia_ of the other magistrates that\r\nhe mentions are those of their lifetime, this should be true of the\r\ncensors. Perhaps the complete purple was worn for certain ceremonial\r\npurposes. Mommsen (_Staatsr._ i. pp. 411 and 446) thinks they were only\r\nburied in it.\r\n\r\n[1022] ἁρχὴ ἀνυπεύθυνος (Dionys. xix. 16).\r\n\r\n[1023] Liv. xxix. 37; Val. Max. vii. 2, 6.\r\n\r\n[1024] Ascon. _in Pison._ p. 9.\r\n\r\n[1025] Hence the helplessness of the tribune against censorial\r\nanimadversion. Cf. Liv. xliv. 16 “multis equi adempti, inter quos P.\r\nRutilio, qui tr. pl. eos violenter accusarat: tribu quoque is motus et\r\naerarius factus.”\r\n\r\n[1026] Cic. _ad Att._ iv. 9, 1.\r\n\r\n[1027] For the later mode of regarding this limitation see Liv. iv. 24\r\n“grave esse iisdem per tot annos magna parte vitae obnoxios vivere.” But,\r\nif the tenure was fixed by the _lex Aemilia_ (of the dictator Mamercus\r\nAemilius, 434 B.C., Liv. l.c.), it originated before the censorship had\r\nbecome a dangerous power.\r\n\r\n[1028] Liv. xxiii. 23 “nec censoriam vim uni permissam et eidem iterum.”\r\nThe prohibition is attributed to a law of Marcius Rutilus Censorinus,\r\ncensor 294 and 265 B.C. (Plut. _Cor._ 1; cf. Val. Max. iv. 1, 3); but it\r\ncould not have been his work, at least as censor, for this official had\r\nnot the _jus rogandi_. See Momms. _Staatsr._ i. p. 520.\r\n\r\n[1029] It is Cicero’s business in the _pro Cluentio_ (43, 122) to\r\nrepresent this divergence of view as a weakness in the censorship; cf.\r\nLiv. xlii. 10 (173 B.C.) “concors et e re publica censura fuit ... neque\r\nab altero notatum alter probavit.” But it was a necessary condition of\r\nthe continuance of the office in a free state.\r\n\r\n[1030] Liv. ix. 34 “cum ita comparatum a majoribus sit ut comitiis\r\ncensoriis nisi duo confecerint legitima suffragia, non renuntiato altero\r\ncomitia differantur.”\r\n\r\n[1031] Tradition attributed the origin of this role to a religions\r\nscruple, “quia eo lustro (in which a _suffectus_ was appointed) Roma est\r\ncapta: nec deinde unquam in demortui locum censor sufficitur” (Liv. v.\r\n31).\r\n\r\n[1032] Cicero mixes up the earlier and later functions in his pseudo-law,\r\nwhich expresses all the activities of the censors (_de Leg._ iii. 3,\r\n7), “Censores populi aevitates, suboles, familias pecuniasque censento:\r\nurbis, tecta, templa, vias, aquas, aerarium, vectigalia tuento:\r\npopulique partes in tribus discribunto: exin pecunias, aevitates,\r\nordines partiunto: equitum peditumque prolem discribunto: caelibes esse\r\nprohibento: mores populi regunto: probrum in senatu ne relinquunto.”\r\n\r\n[1033] Liv. ix. 30.\r\n\r\n[1034] ib. xxiii. 22; see p. 193.\r\n\r\n[1035] In the great _sublectio_ after Cannae (216 B.C.) the ex-curule\r\nmagistrates not already on the list were chosen in the order of their\r\ntenure of power; then the ex-aediles, ex-tribunes of the _plebs_ and the\r\n_quaestorii_, lastly men of distinction who had held no magistracy (Liv.\r\nxxiii. 23).\r\n\r\n[1036] Festus p. 246 “Ovinia tribunicia intervenit, qua sanctum est ut\r\ncensores ex omni ordine optimum quemque jurati (_Cod._ curiati, _Mommsen_\r\ncuriatim) in senatum legerent.” If “ex omni ordine” means “from every\r\ngrade of the magistracy,” the second interpretation is necessary.\r\n\r\n[1037] The _oratio_ of Cato as censor against L. Quinctius Flaminius was\r\ndelivered _post notam_ (Liv. xxxix. 42); but it suggests that the censors\r\nfelt themselves bound at times to give reasons for their actions.\r\n\r\n[1038] The phrases for rejection and omission are _movere_, _ejicere_,\r\n_praeterire_. The last applies both to existing and to expectant\r\nsenators, and has reference to the public reading of the list\r\n(_recitatio_) (Cic. _pro Domo_ 32, 84 “praeteriit in recitando senatu”).\r\n\r\n[1039] Liv. xli. 57 “retinuit quosdam Lepidus a collega praeteritos”; cf.\r\nCic. _pro Cluent._ 43, 122.\r\n\r\n[1040] For a type of _subscriptio_ see Ascon. _in or. in Tog. Cand._ p.\r\n84 “Antonium Gellius et Lentulus censores ... senatu moverunt causasque\r\nsubscripserunt, quod socios diripuerit, quod judicium recusarit, quod\r\npropter aeris alieni magnitudinem praedia manciparit bonaque sua in\r\npotestate non habeat.”\r\n\r\n[1041] Usually the praetorship or quaestorship. Momms. _Staatsr._ i. p.\r\n521 n. 3.\r\n\r\n[1042] See the formula of summons in Varro (_L.L._ vi. 86), “omnes\r\nQuirites pedites armatos, privatosque curatores omnium tribuum, si quis\r\npro se sive pro altero rationem dari volet, vocato in licium huc ad me.”\r\n\r\n[1043] Mommsen believes in a special summons to the _capite censi_\r\n(_Staatsr._ ii. p. 366).\r\n\r\n[1044] Liv. xliii. 14.\r\n\r\n[1045] Cato in 184 assessed articles of luxury at ten times their value\r\n(Liv. xxxix. 44; Plut. _Cat. Maj._ 18).\r\n\r\n[1046] Liv. iv. 24 “Mamercum ... tribu moverunt octuplicatoque censu\r\naerarium fecerunt”; Val. Max. ii. 9, 1 “Camillas et Postumius censores\r\naera poenae nomine eos, qui ad senectutem caelibes pervenerant, in\r\naerarium deferre jusserunt.”\r\n\r\n[1047] See p. 69.\r\n\r\n[1048] Cic. _de Leg._ iii. 3, 7 “familias pecuniasque censento”; _lex\r\nJul. Munic._ l. 147 “rationem pecuniae ... accipito.” _Pecunia_ here\r\napplies to both _res mancipi_ and _nec mancipi_.\r\n\r\n[1049] Cic. l.c. “aevitates suboles ... censento”; _lex Jul. Munic._ l.\r\n145 “eorum ... nomina, praenomina, patres ... et quot annos quisque eorum\r\nhabet ... accipito.”\r\n\r\n[1050] p. 68.\r\n\r\n[1051] Liv. ix. 46 “forensis factio App. Claudi censura vires nacta,\r\nqui ... humilibus per omnes tribus divisis forum et campum corrupit.”\r\nCf. Diod. xx. 46 (App. Claudius) ἔδωκε τοῖς πολίταις ὅποι προαιροῖντο\r\nτιμήσασθαι. Mommsen imagines that it was in this year that the landless\r\ncitizens _first_ found a place in the tribes (_Staatsr._ ii. 392 sq., 402\r\nsq.).\r\n\r\n[1052] Liv. l.c. “aliud integer populus ... aliud forensis factio\r\ntendebat.... Fabius simul concordiae causa, simul ne humilimorum in\r\nmanu comitia essent, omnem forensem turbam excretam in quattuor tribus\r\nconjecit urbanasque eas appellavit.”\r\n\r\n[1053] _Sexagenarius de ponte._ Cf. Cic. _pro Rosc. Amer._ 35, 100 “Habeo\r\netiam dicere, quem contra morem majorum, minorem annis LX de ponte\r\nin Tiberim dejecerit”; Festus p. 334 “quo tempore primum per pontem\r\ncoeperunt comitiis suffragium ferre, juniores conclamaverunt ut de ponte\r\ndejicerentur sexagenari, qui jam nullo publico munere fungerentur, ut\r\nipsi potius sibi quam illi deligerent imperatorem.” If _pons_ could\r\nbe taken literally, a curious parallel is furnished by early Slavonic\r\nprocedure. “The vechés passed whole days in debating the same subjects,\r\nthe only interruptions being free fights in the streets. At Novgorod\r\nthese fights took place on the bridge across the Volchov, and the\r\nstronger party sometimes threw their adversaries into the river beneath”\r\n(Kovalevsky _Modern Customs and Ancient Laws of Russia_, p. 138).\r\n\r\n[1054] p. 221.\r\n\r\n[1055] “Eorum qui arma ferre possent” (Liv. i. 44), τῶν ἐχόντων τὴν\r\nστρατεύσιμον ἡλικίαν (Dionys. xi. 63), τῶν ἐν ταῖς ἡλικίαις (Polyb. ii\r\n24).\r\n\r\n[1056] Momms. _Staatsr._ ii. p. 411.\r\n\r\n[1057] p. 72.\r\n\r\n[1058] Beloch _der Italische Bund_ p. 78.\r\n\r\n[1059] p. 73.\r\n\r\n[1060] The change is put by tradition at the time of the siege of Veii\r\n(403 B.C., Liv. v. 7 “quibus census equester erat, equi publici non erant\r\nadsignati ... senatum adeunt factaque dicendi potestate equis se suis\r\nstipendia facturos promittunt”). Livy here assumes a census as existing\r\nfor the _equites equo publico_, but it is questionable whether it was not\r\ntransferred from these new _equites_ (_equo privato_ as they are called\r\nby modern historians) to the old equestrian centuries.\r\n\r\n[1061] Polyb. vi. πλουτίνδην αὐτῶν γεγενημένης ὑπὸ τοῦ τιμητοῦ τῆς\r\nἐκλογῆς.\r\n\r\n[1062] There is no direct authority for this particular _census_ earlier\r\nthan the Principate. The fact that a _census_, approximating to or\r\nidentical with the equestrian, was required for _judices_ under the\r\nGracchan law, and the specification that these should not be senators\r\nor members of senatorial families, led to these judges being called\r\n“knights.” They were selected from a class practically identical with\r\nthat of the _equites equo privato_.\r\n\r\n[1063] Cic. _pro Cluent._ 48, 134.\r\n\r\n[1064] Suet. _Claud._ 16.\r\n\r\n[1065] Val.

Mommsen\r\n(_Staatsr._ ii. pp. 402 ff.) makes the expressions _tribu movere_ and\r\n_in aerarios referre_ identical after 312 B.C. and interprets both as\r\nsignifying the removal from a higher to a lower tribe.\r\n\r\n[1106] Liv. i. 44; Dionys. iv. 22.\r\n\r\n[1107] At each _lustrum vota_ were offered “quae in proximum lustrum\r\nsuscipi mos est” (Suet. _Aug._ 97). Before the censorship of Scipio\r\nAemilianus it had been the custom to pray “ut populi Romani res meliores\r\namplioresque facerent”; after it, on his initiative, “ut eas perpetuo\r\nincolumes servent” (Val. Max. iv. 1, 10).\r\n\r\n[1108] Cic. _de Leg. Agr._ ii. 19, 50 and 51; 29, 81. The leases were\r\nsometimes of considerable duration (Hyginus p. 116 Lachm. “Ex hoste\r\ncapti agri postquam divisi sunt per centurias ... qui superfuerunt agri\r\nvectigalibus subjecti sunt, alii per annos [quinos], alii per annos\r\ncentenos pluresve: finito illo tempore iterum veneunt locanturque ita ut\r\nvectigalibus est consuetudo”).\r\n\r\n[1109] e.g. a _lex censoria_ enjoined that not more than five thousand\r\nworkmen should be employed in the gold mines of Vercellae by the\r\ncontractor who worked them (Plin. _H.N._ xxxiii. 78).\r\n\r\n[1110] The jurists inform us that this is the true sense of _publicanus_;\r\nthe _conductores_ are only _publicanorum loco_ (_Dig._ 39, 4, 12, 13).\r\nIn common parlance, however, both are _publicani_, and this usage\r\nis etymologically justifiable, since they are both concerned with a\r\n_publicum_, a word which denotes state revenue and state service (_Dig._\r\n39, 4, 1; Tac. _Ann._ xiii. 51; Liv. xxiii. 49, 1).\r\n\r\n[1111] _Vectigal_ (ἀποφορά Plut. _Ti.

App. _B.C._ i. 7).\r\nIn the case of pasture land it was called _scriptura_ (Festus p. 833).\r\n\r\n[1112] _Lex agraria_ l. 85 “ex lege dicta, quam ... censores ...\r\ndeixerunt, publicano dare oportuit.”\r\n\r\n[1113] Cic. _in Verr._ ii. 26, 63; 60, 147; iii. 7, 18.\r\n\r\n[1114] ib. iii. 6, 12 and 14.\r\n\r\n[1115] Polyb. vi. 17.

In 169 and 59 B.C. we find\r\nthe people releasing from an oppressive contract (Liv. xliii. 16; App.\r\n_B.C._ ii. 13).\r\n\r\n[1116] Cic. _de Leg._ iii. 3, 7 “templa, vias, aquas ... tuento”; _ad\r\nFam._ xiii. 11, 1 “sarta tecta (i.e. the repairs of walls and roofs)\r\naedium sacrarum locorumque communium tueri.”\r\n\r\n[1117] Cf. Liv. xxxix. 44 “ultro tributa infimis (pretiis) locaverunt.”\r\n\r\n[1118] ib. xliv. 16 “ad opera publica facienda cum eis (censoribus)\r\ndimidium ex vectigalibus ejus anni attributum ex senatus consulto a\r\nquaestoribus esset”; xl. 46 “censoribus deinde postulantibus ut pecuniae\r\nsumma sibi, qua in opera publica uterentur, attribueretur, vectigal\r\nannuum decretum est.”\r\n\r\n[1119] _Lex Jul. Munic._ l. 73; Liv. xxxix. 44 (quoted n. 2).\r\n\r\n[1120] Mommsen (_Staatsr._ ii. p. 446) takes the phrase to mean something\r\n“voluntarily granted” by the Senate to the magistrate.\r\n\r\n[1121] Liv. xxxix. 44. The later tendency, however, was for such public\r\nrights to be protected by the praetor’s interdicts.\r\n\r\n[1122] ib. xl. 51 “complura sacella publica quae fuerant occupata a\r\nprivatis publica sacraque ut essent paterentque populo curarunt.”\r\n\r\n[1123] ib. xliii. 16 “censores ad pignora capienda miserunt multamque pro\r\ncontione privato dixerunt.”\r\n\r\n[1124] _Lex agraria_ ll. 35, 36.\r\n\r\n[1125] ib.\r\n\r\n[1126] p. 208.\r\n\r\n[1127] p. 93.\r\n\r\n[1128] p. 94.\r\n\r\n[1129] pp. 95 ff.\r\n\r\n[1130] p. 190.\r\n\r\n[1131] p. 162.\r\n\r\n[1132] p. 126.\r\n\r\n[1133] Cic. _de Leg.

Caesar says\r\n“Sullam nudata omnibus rebus tribunicia potestate tamen intercessionem\r\nliberam reliquisse” (_B.C._ i. 7), and Cicero “Sullam probo, qui tribunis\r\nplebis sua lege injuriae faciendae potestatem ademerit, auxilii ferendi\r\nreliquerit” (_de Leg._ iii. 9, 22). He probably formulated cases in which\r\nit could not be employed. There are instances of the tribunician veto\r\nbetween 81 B.C. and 70 B.C., the date of the restoration of the tribune’s\r\npower.

(Frontinus\r\n_de aquaeductibus_ 129). It runs: “T. Quinctius Crispinus consul populum\r\njure rogavit populusque jure scivit in foro pro rostris aedis divi Juli\r\npr(idie) [k] Julias.

Gell. xv. 27, 5 “Cum ex generibus hominum\r\nsuffragium feratur, ‘curiata’ comitia esse, cum ex censu et aetate\r\n‘centuriata,’ cum ex regionibus et locis, ‘tributa.’”\r\n\r\n[1236] How easily one _comitia_ could melt into another is shown by the\r\nwords of Cicero [_ad Fam._ vii. 30 (44 B.C.)] “Ille autem (Caesar), qui\r\ncomitiis tributis esset auspicatus, centuriata habuit.”\r\n\r\n[1237] See Appendix on the _comitia tributa_.\r\n\r\n[1238] p. 49.\r\n\r\n[1239] Messala ap. Gell. xiii. 15, 4 “Minoribus creatis magistratibus\r\ntributis comitiis magistratus, sed justus curiata datur lege.”\r\n\r\n[1240] Dio Cass. xxxix. 19.\r\n\r\n[1241] ib. xli. 43.\r\n\r\n[1242] Cic. _de Leg. Agr._ ii. 12, 30 “consuli, si legem curiatam non\r\nhabet, attingere rem militarem non licet.”\r\n\r\n[1243] Sulla’s law had said that the magistrate should retain _imperium_\r\nuntil he re-entered the city, apparently without mentioning the _lex\r\ncuriata_. App. Claudius, consul for 54 B.C., who had been prevented by\r\nthe tribunician veto from getting his _lex curiata_ passed, presumed on\r\nthis silence and said “legem curiatam consuli ferri opus esse, necesse\r\nnon esse; se, quoniam ex senatus consulto provinciam haberet, lege\r\nCornelia imperium habiturum quoad in urbem introisset” (Cic. _ad Fam._ i.\r\n9, 25).\r\n\r\n[1244] Cic. _de Leg. Agr._ ii. 12, 31.\r\n\r\n[1245] p. 26.\r\n\r\n[1246] Gell. xv. 27, 1 “‘calata’ comitia esse, quae pro conlegio\r\npontificum habentur aut regis aut flaminum inaugurandorum causa. Eorum\r\nautem alia esse ‘curiata,’ alia ‘centuriata’ ... Isdem comitiis, quae\r\n‘calata’ appellari diximus, et sacrorum detestatio et testamenta fieri\r\nsolebant.” It is not known what particular acts were reserved for the\r\n“comitia calata” assembled _centuriatim_; Mommsen thinks the inauguration\r\nof the Flamen Martialis outside the city (_Staatsr._ iii. p. 307).\r\n\r\n[1247] p. 107.\r\n\r\n[1248] pp. 107, 246.\r\n\r\n[1249] p. 244.\r\n\r\n[1250] Liv. i. 43 “Nec mirari oportet hunc ordinem, qui nunc est post\r\nexpletas quinque et triginta tribus duplicate earum numero centuriis\r\njuniorum seniorumque, ad institutam ab Servio Tullio summam non\r\nconvenire.” Cf. Dionys. iv. 21. The description of Cicero (_de Rep._\r\nii. 22, 39 and 40) probably refers to the Servian arrangement, although\r\nMommsen (_Staatsr._ iii. p. 275) holds that it refers to the reformed\r\n_comitia_. The description given in the text is in essentials that of\r\nPantagathus (died 1567) _ap. Ursinum in_ Liv. i. 43. For the different\r\nsystems that have been adopted see Willems _Le Droit Public_ p. 97.\r\nMommsen (l.c.) admits the 70 votes for the 70 centuries of the first\r\nclass, but thinks that the 280 centuries of the other classes were so\r\ncombined as to form but 100 votes; the total votes being 70 + 100 + 5 +\r\n18 = 193, as before.\r\n\r\n[1251] p. 73.\r\n\r\n[1252] Cic. _Phil._ ii. 33, 82 “Ecce Dolabellae comitiorum dies: sortitio\r\npraerogativae: quiescit. Renuntiatur, tacet. Prima classis vocatur:\r\nrenuntiatur. Deinde, ita ut assolet, suffragia; tum secunda classis.”\r\n\r\n[1253] Liv. xliii. 16 “cum ex duodecim centuriis equitum octo censorem\r\ncondemnassent, multaeque aliae primae classis.” It would seem as though\r\nthe _sex suffragia_ (p. 73) voted with or after the first class.\r\nDrakenborch would read _octodecim_ for _duodecim_, but this would seem to\r\ngive too small a number of condemnatory votes amongst the _equites_.\r\n\r\n[1254] Cic. _pro Planc._ 20, 49.\r\n\r\n[1255] Hence such expressions as _Aniensis juniorum_, _Veturia juniorum_,\r\n_Galeria juniorum_ (Liv. xxiv. 7; xxvi. 22; xxvii. 6).\r\n\r\n[1256] App. _B.C._ i. 59.\r\n\r\n[1257] See Appendix on the _comitia tributa_.\r\n\r\n[1258] p. 107.\r\n\r\n[1259] Liv. xxv. 4 (212 B.C.) “Tribuni plebem rogaverunt plebesque ita\r\nscivit, ‘Si M. Postumius ante K. Maias non prodisset citatusque eo die\r\nnon respondisset neque excusatus esset, videri eum in exilio esse,\r\nbonaque ejus venire, ipsi aqua et igni placere interdici”; ib. xxvi. 3\r\n(211 B.C.) “Cn. Fulvius exulatum Tarquinios abiit. Id ei justum exilium\r\nesse scivit plebs.”\r\n\r\n[1260] When Plutarch says (_C. Gracch._ 4) that C. Gracchus gave the\r\nright of trying such cases τῷ δήμῳ, this word may include the Plebs.\r\nGracchus at least seems to have banished the ex-consul Popilius by means\r\nof a _plebiscitum_ (Cic. _pro Domo_ 31, 82 “ubi enim tuleras ut mihi aqua\r\net igni interdiceretur? quod Gracchus de P. Popilio ... tulit”).\r\n\r\n[1261] App. _B.C._ i. 59.\r\n\r\n[1262] This conclusion has been drawn from the words of Cicero (_in\r\nVerr._ Act i. 13, 38) “judiciis ad senatorium ordinem translatis\r\nsublataque populi Romani in unum quemque vestrum potestate.”\r\n\r\n[1263] Cic. _de Leg. Agr._ ii. 7, 18 “Quod populus per religionem\r\nsacerdotia mandare non poterat, ut minor pars populi vocaretur.”\r\n\r\n[1264] For this presidency by the youngest pontifex (the one, i.e., who\r\nstood the least chance of election) see Liv. xxv. 5 (212 B.C.). From Cic.\r\n_ad Brut._ i. 5, 4 it follows that the consuls had something to do with\r\narranging the elections, but not that they were ever the presidents.\r\n\r\n[1265] Cic. _de Leg.

Cf. the prescription of the _lex Quinctia de\r\naquaeductibus_ (p. 242).\r\n\r\n[1272] Gell. xiii. 15, 1 “In edicto consulum, quo edicunt quis dies\r\ncomitiis centuriatis futurus sit.” “Comitia edicere” (Liv. xxiii. 31) and\r\n“comitia indicere” (Liv. iv. 6) are employed as descriptive of this act.\r\n\r\n[1273] Festus p. 224 “promulgari leges dicuntur cum primum in vulgus\r\neduntur, quasi provulgari.”\r\n\r\n[1274] Momms. _Staatsr._ iii. p. 370.\r\n\r\n[1275] Schol.

Cic. _de\r\nLeg._ iii. 4, 11. Clodius’ law exiling Cicero in 58 B.C. was amended\r\n(Cic. _ad Att._ iii. 2 “praesertim nondum rogatione correcta”), but\r\nwhether before or after promulgation is not clear.\r\n\r\n[1276] Dionysius, Plutarch, and Priscian explain _trinum nundinum_ as the\r\nthird market-day, an interval of _trinarum nundinarum_, i.e. seventeen\r\ndays; but Mommsen has made out a good case for its being three _nundina_,\r\ni.e. intervals of eight days (_Staatsr._ iii. p. 375).\r\n\r\n[1277] p. 164.\r\n\r\n[1278] p. 38.\r\n\r\n[1279] Varro _L.L._ vi. 91 “comitiatum praeco populum vocet ad te, et eum\r\nde muris vocet praeco.”\r\n\r\n[1280] The herald is not mentioned in connexion with the _concilium\r\nplebis_. The _comitia curiata_ were summoned by a _lictor curiatius_. See\r\nMomms. _Staatsr._ iii. p. 386.\r\n\r\n[1281] Gell. xv. 27; Dio Cass. xxxvii. 27.\r\n\r\n[1282] Varro _L.L._ vi. 92; Plut. _C.

Asc. _in Cornel._ p. 70 “discedere, quod verbum\r\n... significat ... [ut] in suam quisque tribum discedat, in qua est\r\nsuffragium laturus.”\r\n\r\n[1289] Hence the expression _ferre punctum_ (Cic. _pro Planc._ 22, 53).\r\n\r\n[1290] Liv. v. 13; iii. 21.\r\n\r\n[1291] Cic. _de Leg._ iii. cc. 15, 16.\r\n\r\n[1292] Hence the discovery of a fraud at an election through tablets\r\nbeing μιᾷ χειρὶ γεγραμμέναις (Plut. _Cat.

Gr. eg._ 7, 17.\r\n\r\n[1295] p. 253.\r\n\r\n[1296] The first curia or tribe is the _principium_. See the prescription\r\nof the _lex Quinctia_ (p. 242). Even after the ballot was introduced the\r\nname of the first voter in a division was specified (_primus scivit_,\r\nl.c.).\r\n\r\n[1297] _Tribus_ or _centurias non explere_ is said of such candidates\r\n(Liv. iii. 64; xxxvii. 47). Cf. Liv. xxii. 35.\r\n\r\n[1298] Cic. _in Pis._ 15, 36 “hoc certe video quod indicant tabulae\r\npublicae vos rogatores, vos diribitores, vos custodes fuisse tabularum.”\r\nIt is the list of votes as certified by the guardians and tellers rather\r\nthan the separate voting tablets that Cicero here speaks of. But the\r\ntablets themselves were kept for a time in _loculi_ (Varro _R.R._ iii. 5,\r\n18).\r\n\r\n[1299] Cic. _de Leg._ iii. 20, 46 “Legum custodiam nullam habemus. Itaque\r\neae leges sunt quas apparisores nostri volunt; a librariis petimus.”\r\n\r\n[1300] See the evidences collected by Mommsen (_Staatsr._ iii. pp.\r\n418-419). It is from this practice that _figere_ and _refigere_ are used\r\nof the publication and annulling of laws.\r\n\r\n[1301] p. 219.\r\n\r\n[1302] Cic. _pro Sest._ 65, 137 “senatum reipublicae custodem, praesidem,\r\npropugnatorem collocaverunt (majores); hujus ordinis auctoritate uti\r\nmagistratus et quasi ministros gravissimi consilii esse voluerunt.”\r\n\r\n[1303] Festus p. 142 “mulleos genus calceorum aiunt esse, quibus reges\r\nAlbanorum primi, deinde patricii sunt usi.”\r\n\r\n[1304] Hence the distinction between the patrician and plebeian form of\r\nshoe (Mommsen _Staatsr._ iii. p. 891). In the time of Cato the elder this\r\nfootgear was only worn by the plebeian senator “qui magistratum curulem\r\ncepisset” (Festus l.c.).\r\n\r\n[1305] For an investiture of boys with the _latus clavus_ earlier than\r\nthe rule of Augustus, see Suet. _Aug._ 94.\r\n\r\n[1306] Tac. _Ann._ xi. 22 “post lege Sullae viginti (quaestores) creati\r\nsupplendo senatui.”\r\n\r\n[1307] Gell. iv. 10, 8 “Erat ... jus senatori ut sententiam rogatus\r\ndiceret ante quicquid vellet aliae rei et quoad vellet.” For this\r\npractice of _egredi relationem_ see Tac. _Ann._ ii. 33.\r\n\r\n[1308] “Delenda est Carthago” (Florus ii. 15); cf. App. _Lib._ 69.\r\n\r\n[1309] An attempt to violate this order was made in 56 B.C., “cum Lupus\r\ntribunus pl.... intendere coepit ante se oportere discessionem facere\r\nquam consules. Ejus orationi vehementer ab omnibus reclamatum est; erat\r\nenim et iniqua et nova” (Cic. _ad Fam._ i. 2, 2).\r\n\r\n[1310] The consul Marcellus thus dismissed the Senate in 50 B.C. on its\r\nfavouring the proposal that both Pompeius and Caesar should lay down\r\ntheir commands (App. _B.C._ ii. 30).\r\n\r\n[1311] Gell. iv. 10, 8.\r\n\r\n[1312] ib. l.c.; Suet. _Caes._ 20.\r\n\r\n[1313] Gell. xiv. 7, 9 (from the _Commentarius_ of Varro) “singulos\r\nautem debere consuli gradatim incipique a consulari gradu. Ex quo gradu\r\nsemper quidem antea primum rogari solitum qui princeps in senatum lectus\r\nesset; tum autem, cum haec scriberet, novum morem institutum refert per\r\nambitionem gratiamque ut is primus rogaretur quem rogare vellet qui\r\nhaberet senatum, dum is tamen ex gradu consulari esset.” For this _novus\r\nmos_ cf. Cic. _ad Att._ i. 13, 2 (61 B.C.) “Primum igitur scito primum\r\nme non esse rogatum sententiam praepositumque esse nobis pacificatorem\r\nAllobrogum” (C. Calpurnius Piso, a relative of the presiding consul).\r\n\r\n[1314] Sall. _Cat._ 50 (in the debate on the Catilinarian conspirators)\r\n“D. Junius Silanus primus sententiam rogatus quod eo tempore consul\r\ndesignatus erat.”\r\n\r\n[1315] Festus p. 210 “(Pedarius senator) ita appellator quia tacitus\r\ntranseundo ad eum, cujus sententiam probat, quid sentiat indicat.” Cf.\r\nGell. iii. 18. The explanation cited by Festus is true only so far as it\r\nexpresses a usual circumstance of debate. The name _pedarius_ is probably\r\nderived from the absence of the curule chair (Gavius Bassus ap. Gell.\r\nl.c.).\r\n\r\n[1316] Vell. ii. 35 “Hic tribunus plebis designatus ... paene inter\r\nultimos interrogatus sententiam”; Cic. _ad Att._ xii. 21, 1 “Cur ergo in\r\nsententiam Catonis? Quia verbis luculentioribus et pluribus rem eandem\r\n(i.e. the opinion already expressed by _consulares_) comprehenderat.”\r\n\r\n[1317] See p. 270 n. 2.\r\n\r\n[1318] In a rough estimate of the house (61 B.C.) Cicero mentions 15 on\r\none side of a question, “quite 400” on the other (_ad Att._ i. 14, 5). On\r\nCurio’s proposal in 50 B.C. that both Pompeius and Caesar should lay down\r\ntheir commands, 22 dissented, 370 approved (App. _B.C._ ii. 30). In the\r\nlatter case there seems to have been no formal division (see p. 268 n.\r\n2); and in both the small numbers may be the result of exact computation,\r\nthe large either of a guess or of a deduction drawn from an already\r\ncounted quorum.\r\n\r\n[1319] “Verbo adsentiri” (Sall. _Cat._ 52); cf. Cic. _ad Fam._ v. 2, 9\r\n“sedens iis adsensi.”\r\n\r\n[1320] “In alienam sententiam pedibus ire” (Gell. iii. 18, 1).\r\n\r\n[1321] The invitation to divide on the _sententia_ was couched in the\r\nform “Qui hoc censetis, illuc transite: qui alia omnia, in hanc partem”\r\n(Festus p. 261). Hence the colloquial phrase “ire in alia omnia” for\r\nnegativing a proposal at the Senate (Cic. _ad Fam._ i. 2, 1).\r\n\r\n[1322] Cic. _ad Att._ i. 14, 3 “totum hunc locum, quem ego ... soleo\r\npingere, de flamma, de ferro—nosti illas ληκύθους.”\r\n\r\n[1323] p. 179.\r\n\r\n[1324] Cic. _ad Fam._ viii. 8, 5 ff. In § 6 we find the formula “Si quis\r\nhuic s. c. intercesserit, senatui placere auctoritatem perscribi.”\r\n\r\n[1325] ib. l.c. § 6 “Pr. Kal. Octobres in aede Apollinis scrib. adfuerunt\r\nL. Domitius Cn. f. Fab. Ahenobarbus,” etc.\r\n\r\n[1326] p. 148.\r\n\r\n[1327] Plut. _Ti. Gracch._ 10; App. _B.C._ i. 12.\r\n\r\n[1328] Polyb. xxx. 4. For the motive of the veto see Liv. xlv. 21 “M.\r\nJuventius Thalna ... praetor novo maloque exemplo rem ingressus erat,\r\nquod, ante non consulto senatu, non consulibus certioribus factis, de\r\nsua unius sententia rogationem ferret vellent juberentne Rhodiis bellum\r\nindici, cum antea semper prius senatus de bello consultus esset, deinde\r\nex auctoritate patrum ad populum latum.”\r\n\r\n[1329] Suet. _Caes._ 16 (Caesar supported Metellus in carrying)\r\n“turbulentissimas leges adversus collegarum intercessionem ... donec ambo\r\nadministratione reipublicae decreto patrum submoverentur.”\r\n\r\n[1330] In this case the prohibition was effected through the coercive\r\npower of the consul springing from his _majus imperium_ (Dio Cass. xlii.\r\n23).\r\n\r\n[1331] Tac. _Ann._ ii. 30 “vetere senatus consulto quaestio in caput\r\ndomini prohibebatur.”\r\n\r\n[1332] Cic. _ad Att._ v. 21, 13 (50 B.C.) “cum senatus consultum modo\r\nfactum sit ... in creditorum causa, ut centesimae perpetuo faenore\r\nducerentur.”\r\n\r\n[1333] Ascon. _in Cornel._ p. 58.\r\n\r\n[1334] M. Brutus had gained from the Senate the validation of a bond\r\n(_syngrapha_), by which an exorbitant rate of interest was demanded from\r\nthe government of Salamis in Cyprus. Bonds of this kind, through which\r\nobligations were incurred by provincials at Rome, had been rendered\r\nillegal by a _lex Gabinia_ of 67 B.C. (Cic. _ad Att._ v. 21, 12).\r\n\r\n[1335] Cic. _pro Domo_ 16, 41 “judicavit senatus M. Drusi legibus, quae\r\ncontra legem Caeciliam et Didiam latae essent, populum non teneri.” The\r\naccount that the Livian laws were shelved as _contra auspicia_ (Ascon.\r\n_in Cornel._ p. 68 “Philippus cos.... obtinuit a senatu, ut leges ejus\r\nomnes uno s. c. tollerentur. Decretum est enim contra auspicia esse\r\nlatas neque eis teneri populum”) may contain one of the grounds of their\r\nabrogation.\r\n\r\n[1336] Cic. _ad Att._ iii. 15, 5 “Quod te cum Culleone scribis de\r\nprivilegio locutum, est aliquid, sed multo est melius abrogari.”\r\n\r\n[1337] p. 204.\r\n\r\n[1338] Liv. xxv. 4; Sall. _Cat._ 50; Ascon. _in Milon._ p. 44. The\r\nSenate in this way sometimes interprets a criminal law and extends its\r\nincidence. See Cic. _de Har. Resp._ 8, 15 “decrevit senatus eos qui id\r\nfecissent (i.e. who had disturbed the rebuilding of Cicero’s house) lege\r\nde vi, quae est in eos qui universam rem publicam oppugnassent (i.e. vi\r\npublica) teneri.”\r\n\r\n[1339] Cic. _ad Att._ i. 13, 3 “Credo enim te audisse, cum apud Caesarem\r\npro populo fieret, venisse eo muliebri vestitu virum ... mentionem a\r\nQ. Cornificio in senatu factam ... postea rem ex senatus consulto ad\r\npontifices relatam, idque ab iis nefas esse decretum; deinde ex senatus\r\nconsulto consules rogationem promulgasse.”\r\n\r\n[1340] Liv. viii. 18.\r\n\r\n[1341] ib. xl. 43 (180 B.C.) “A. C. Maenio praetore (cui, provincia\r\nSardinia cum evenisset, additum erat ut quaereret de veneficiis longius\r\nab urbe decem millibus passuum) literae adlatae _se jam tria millia\r\nhominum damnasse_.”\r\n\r\n[1342] Liv. xxxix. 41 (184 B.C.); cf. ix. 26 (314 B.C.) and the instance\r\ncited in the next note. In such instances of _quaestiones_ extended to\r\nItaly, it is not clear whether _socii_ as well as _cives_ were executed\r\nsummarily by Roman magistrates.\r\n\r\n[1343] ib. xxxix. 18. On this point see Zumpt _Criminalrecht der Römer_\r\ni. 2 p. 212.\r\n\r\n[1344] _C.I.L._ i. n. 196 (a letter from the consuls to some unknown\r\nmagistrates of the _ager Teuranus_ in Brutii) l. 24 “eorum (i.e. the\r\nSenate) sententia ita fuit ‘sei ques esent, quei avorsum ead fecisent,\r\nquam suprad scriptum est, eeis rem caputalem faciendam censuere.’”\r\n\r\n[1345] The consul was armed against C. Gracchus, the consuls in 63; the\r\nconsuls, praetors, and tribunes in 100 B.C.; the interrex, proconsul, and\r\nall other magistrates with _imperium_ in 77 B.C.\r\n\r\n[1346] The decree proposed to meet the threatened revolution of M.\r\nLepidus in 77 B.C. ran as follows: “quoniam M. Lepidus exercitum privato\r\nconsilio paratum cum pessimis et hostibus rei publicae contra hujus\r\nordinis auctoritatem ad urbem ducit, uti Appius Claudius interrex cum\r\nQ. Catulo pro consule et ceteris, quibus imperium est, urbi praesidio\r\nsint operamque dent ne quid res publica detrimenti capiat” (from speech\r\nof Philippus in Sall. _Hist._ lib. i. frgt. 77, § 22). The historical\r\ninstances of the employment of this power are against C. Gracchus and\r\nhis adherents in 121 B.C., in the tumult of Saturninus (100), the first\r\nSullan restoration (88), by the anti-Sullans (82), at the threatened\r\nrevolution of M. Lepidus (77), in the Catilinarian conspiracy (63),\r\nduring the disturbances raised by Q. Metellus (62), and those preceding\r\nthe sole consulship of Pompeius (52), against Caesar (49), against\r\nDolabella and M. Antonius (43).\r\n\r\n[1347] Cf. Sall. _Cat._ 50 “consul ... convocato senatu refert quid de\r\neis fieri placeat, qui in custodiam traditi erant. Sed eos paulo ante\r\nfrequens senatus judivcaerat contra rem publicam fecisse.”\r\n\r\n[1348] Although the _ultimum senatus consultum_ had not been passed\r\nagainst Ti. Gracchus, the condemnation of his adherents without appeal\r\n(Vell. ii. 7; Val. Max. iv. 7, 1) was the exercise of the jurisdiction of\r\nmartial law. It was this jurisdiction which elicited the _plebiscitum_ of\r\nC. Gracchus.\r\n\r\n[1349] Cic. _pro Rab._ 4, 12 “C. Gracchus legem tulit ne de capite civium\r\nRomanorum injussu vestro judicaretur.”\r\n\r\n[1350] Schol. Ambros. p. 370 “Quia sententiam (wrongly for “legem”;\r\nsee Zumpt _Criminalrecht_ i. 2 p. 73) tulerat Gracchus ne quis in\r\ncivem Romanum capitalem sententiam diceret.” Cf. Cic. _pro Sest._ 28,\r\n61 “Consule me, (Cato), cum esset designatus tribunus plebis, obtulit\r\nin discrimen vitam suam: dixit eam sententiam, cujus invidiam capitis\r\npericulo sibi praestandam videbat.” So Dio Cassius (xxxviii 14), in\r\nspeaking of the first bill of Clodius against Cicero, says ἔφερε μὲν γὰρ\r\nκαὶ ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν βουλήν, ὅτι τοῖς τε ὑπάτοις τὴν φυλακὴν τῆς πόλεως ...\r\nπροσετετάχει.\r\n\r\n[1351] Plut. _C. Gracch._ 4 τὸν δὲ (νόμον εἰσέφερε) εἴ τις ἄρχων ἄκριτον\r\nἐκκεκηρύχοι πολίτην, κατ’ αὐτοῦ διδόντα κρίσιν τῷ δήμῳ. δῆμος here may\r\nmean either _populus_ or _plebs_; but Gracchus, as tribune, put his own\r\nlaw into force against Popilius (Cic. _pro Domo_ 31, 82).\r\n\r\n[1352] Cic. _in Cat._ iv. 5, 10 “At vero C. Caesar intelligit legem\r\nSemproniam esse de civibus Romanis constitutam; qui autem rei publicae\r\nsit hostis eum civem esse nullo modo posse.”\r\n\r\n[1353] Cic. _in Pis._ 4, 9; _pro Sest._ 25, 55; Dio Cass. xxxviii. 13.\r\n\r\n[1354] Cic. _ad Q. fr._ ii. 3, 5 (56 B.C.) “senatus consultum factum est\r\nut sodalitates decuriatique discederent lexque de iis ferretur ut, qui\r\nnon discessissent, ea poena quae est de vi tenerentur.” The _sodalitates_\r\nwere clubs of the type of the Greek ἑταιρεῖαι, the _decuriati_ probably\r\nelectioneering associations.\r\n\r\n[1355] Cic. _ad Att._ i. 16, 12 (61 B.C.) “senatus consulta duo jam facta\r\nsunt odiosa ... unum, ut apud magistratus inquiri liceret, alterum, cujus\r\ndomi divisores habitarent, adversus rem publicam.”\r\n\r\n[1356] Liv. ix. 8-12; Plut. _Ti. Gracch._ 7; Cic. _de Off._ iii. 30, 109;\r\nSall. _Jug._ 39.\r\n\r\n[1357] Sall. _Jug._ 39 “senatus ita, uti par fuerat, decernit suo atque\r\npopuli injussu nullum potuisse foedus fieri.”\r\n\r\n[1358] Polyb. vi. 14 ὑπὲρ εἰρήνης οὗτος (ὁ δῆμος) βουλεύεται καὶ πολέμου.\r\nκαὶ μὴν περὶ συμμαχίας καὶ διαλύσεως καὶ συνθηκῶν οὑτός ἐστιν ὁ βεβαιῶν\r\nἕκαστα τούτων καὶ κύρια ποιῶν ἢ τοὐναντίον.\r\n\r\n[1359] The Gaditani approach the Senate for the renovation of a treaty\r\nmade with a pro-magistrate in 78 B.C. Cicero questions its validity\r\n(_pro Balbo_ 15, 34) on the ground that the people was not consulted.\r\nThe passage illustrates both the Senate’s exercise of this power and the\r\ncontinuance of a controversy as to its right.\r\n\r\n[1360] Hence the institution of the _Graecostasis_. Varro (_L.L._ v.\r\n165) describes it as “sub dextra hujus (the Rostra) a comitio locus\r\nsubstructus ubi nationum subsisterent legati, qui ad senatum essent\r\nmissi; is Graecostasis appellatus a parte ut multa.”\r\n\r\n[1361] So the Numantian envoys in 36 B.C. are received ἔξω τοῦ τείχους\r\n(Dio _fr._ 79). As a rule the appeal was made to the nearest _imperator_,\r\nand his representations might accord such legati a reception within the\r\ncity. See Momms. _Staatsr._ iii. 2 p. 1150.\r\n\r\n[1362] Liv. _Ep._ xlvi. “in commune lex lata est ne cui regi Romam venire\r\nliceret.” Cf. Polyb. xxx. 17.\r\n\r\n[1363] Cic. _ad Q. fr._ ii. 13, 3 “Appius interpretatur ... quod Gabinia\r\nsanctum sit, etiam cogi ex Kal. Febr. usque ad Kal. Mart. legatis senatum\r\nquotidie dare.”\r\n\r\n[1364] Polyb. xxii. 24; Liv. xlv. 17.\r\n\r\n[1365] For the attempt made by the _lex Sempronia_ to obviate this power\r\nsee p. 201.\r\n\r\n[1366] Cic. _ad Fam._ v. 2, 3 (to Metellus Celer, proconsul of Cisalpine\r\nGaul, 62 B.C.) “Nihil dico de sortitione vestra: tantum te suspicari volo\r\nnihil in ea re per collegam meum me insciente esse factum.” Cf. _ad Att._\r\ni. 16, 8.\r\n\r\n[1367] Liv. xlv. 13; Dittenberger n. 240. The Senate sometimes referred\r\nquestions respecting the internal affairs of these states to Roman\r\n_patroni_, with whom they had entered into relations of clientship (Liv.\r\nix. 20; Cic. _pro Sulla_ 21, 60).\r\n\r\n[1368] _lex de Termessibus_ ii. 6 “Nei quis magistratus ... meilites ...\r\nintroducito ... nisei senatus nominatim ... decreverit.”\r\n\r\n[1369] Sall. _Jug._ 62 “Metellus propere cunctos senatorii ordinis ex\r\nhibernis accersi jubet: eorum et aliorum, quos idoneos ducebat, consilium\r\nhabet.” Cf. c. 104 “Marius ... Sullam (the quaestor) ab Utica venire\r\njubet, item L. Bellienum praetorem, praeterea omnes undique senatorii\r\nordinis, quibuscum mandata Bocchi cognoscit.”\r\n\r\n[1370] Cic. _ad Att._ ii. 16, 4 “Illud tamen, quod scribit (Q. Cicero,\r\ngovernor of Asia) animadvertas velim, de portorio circumvectionis; ait se\r\nde consilii sententia rem ad senatum rejecisse.”\r\n\r\n[1371] Cic. _de Off._ ii. 22, 76 “tantum in aerarium pecuniae invexit\r\n(Paulus) ut unius imperatoris praeda finem attulerit tributorum.” Cf.\r\nPlut. _Paul._ 38.\r\n\r\n[1372] Momms. _Staatsr._ iii. 2 pp. 1112-20.\r\n\r\n[1373] Plut. _Ti. Gracch._ 14 οὐδὲν ἔφη τῇ συγκλήτῳ βουλεύεσθαι\r\nπροσήκειν, ἀλλὰ τῳ δήμῳ γνώμην αὐτὸς προθήσειν.\r\n\r\n[1374] p. 229.\r\n\r\n[1375] The Senate invalidated the _locationes_ of the censors of 184 B.C.\r\n(Liv. xxxix. 44 “locationes cum senatus precibus et lacrimis publicanorum\r\nvictus induci et de integro locari jussisset”). A vain appeal was made\r\nby the _publicani_ of Asia to remit their contracts in 60 B.C. (Cic. _ad\r\nAtt._ i. 17, 9; cf. ii. 1, 8).\r\n\r\n[1376] The business of draining the Pomptine marshes is entrusted to\r\na consul (Liv. _Ep._ xlvi.), the building of an aqueduct to a praetor\r\n(Frontin. _de Aquaed._ 7).\r\n\r\n[1377] Cic. _ad Att._ iii. 24.\r\n\r\n[1378] This was necessary when the supplies were destined for the\r\narmy. See Sall. _Jug._ 104 “(Rufus) qui quaestor stipendium in Africam\r\nportaverat.” Compare the section on provincial government.\r\n\r\n[1379] The phrase for opening this credit is _attribuere_. See Liv.\r\nxliv. 16 “ad opera publica facienda cum eis (censoribus) dimidium ex\r\nvectigalibus ejus anni (169 B.C.) attributum ex senatus consulto a\r\nquaestoribus esset.”\r\n\r\n[1380] p. 194.\r\n\r\n[1381] Cic. _ad Fam._ i. 1 sq.\r\n\r\n[1382] Cic. _ad Q. fr._ ii. 6, 4 and 5 (56 B.C.) “consul est\r\negregius Lentulus ... Dies comitiales exemit omnes. Nam etiam\r\nLatinae instaurantur: nec tamen deerant supplicationes. Sic legibus\r\nperniciosissimis obsistitur.”\r\n\r\n[1383] In the later Republic these periods of thanksgiving had reached\r\nthe inordinate length of fifteen, twenty, and even fifty days (Caes.\r\n_Bell. Gall._ ii. 35; iv. 38; Cic. _Phil._ xiv. 11, 29). At this period\r\nthe _supplicatio_ was considered the usual preliminary of a triumph; but\r\nCato explains to Cicero that this was not always the case (_ad Fam._\r\nxv. 5, 2 “Quodsi triumphi praerogativam putas supplicationem et idcirco\r\ncasum potius quam te laudari mavis, neque supplicationem sequitur semper\r\ntriumphus,” etc.).\r\n\r\n[1384] Cic. _pro Domo_ 49, 127 “video ... esse legem veterem tribuniciam\r\nquae vetat injussu plebis aedes, terram, aram consecrari.” The _jussus\r\nplebis_ probably implies that of the _populus_ as well. See Momms.\r\n_Staatsr._ iii. 2 p. 1050.\r\n\r\n[1385] The Senate alone is mentioned as decreeing the reception of the\r\n_Magna Mater_ in 205 B.C., and as ordaining the erection of her temple\r\n(Liv. xxix. 10 and 11; xxxvi. 36).\r\n\r\n[1386] See p. 56.\r\n\r\n[1387] Dionys. ii. 72; Liv. i. 32; cf. Plin. _H.N._ xxii. 2.\r\n\r\n[1388] Polyb. iii. 25; Liv. i. 24. Yet the ceremonies they describe\r\nare different. In that related by Polybius the stone has a passive\r\nsignification; the priest hurls it from him and prays, “May I only be\r\ncast out, if I break my oath, as this stone is now.” In that described by\r\nLivy, “the pig represents the perjurer, the flint-knife the instrument\r\nof divine vengeance” (Strachan-Davidson’s Polybius, _Proleg._ viii.),\r\nand Jupiter is here to strike the _people_ that fails in the compact.\r\nPossibly the two forms of ritual were used in different kinds of\r\ntreaties; the first, perhaps, in commercial compacts, the second in\r\nagreements that closed a war.\r\n\r\n[1389] Liv. iv. 17; Middleton _Ancient Rome_ i. p. 245.\r\n\r\n[1390] Liv. v. 36.\r\n\r\n[1391] See p. 283.\r\n\r\n[1392] Liv. xxii. 61.\r\n\r\n[1393] Varro _L.L._ v. 3 “multa verba aliud nunc ostendunt, aliud ante\r\nsignificabant, ut hostis: nam tum eo verbo dicebant peregrinum qui suis\r\nlegibus uteretur, nunc dicunt eum quem tum dicebant perduellem.” Cf. Cic.\r\n_de Off._ i. 12, 37.\r\n\r\n[1394] p. 284.\r\n\r\n[1395] Polyb. iii. 22.\r\n\r\n[1396] “Aeduos, fratres consanguineosque saepe numero a senatu\r\nappellatos” (Caes. _B.G._ i. 33).\r\n\r\n[1397] Cf. p. 284 for this rule and for the exception to it made in 166\r\nB.C.\r\n\r\n[1398] In the first treaty with Carthage two kinds of legal satisfaction\r\nare given to Roman traders. In Libya and Sardinia the state guarantees\r\nthe debt; in the Sicilian cities under the Carthaginian protectorate\r\nRomans and Carthaginians are on an equal footing (Polyb. iii. 22).\r\n\r\n[1399] Hartmann (O. E.) _Der ordo judiciorum und die judicia\r\nextraordinaria der Römer_ Thl. i. pp. 229 ff.\r\n\r\n[1400] Festus p. 274 “Reciperatio est, ut ait Gallus Aelius, cum inter\r\npopulum et reges nationesque et civitates peregrinas lex convenit\r\nquomodo per reciperatores reddantur res reciperenturque resque privatas\r\ninter se persequantur.” See Keller _Civilprocess_ p. 36; Rudorff\r\n_Rechtsgeschichte_ ii. p. 34.\r\n\r\n[1401] p. 207.\r\n\r\n[1402] In the treaty supposed to be the work of Spurius Cassius and to\r\ndate from 493 B.C. the following clause was found: τῶν τ’ ἰδιωτικῶν\r\nσυμβολαίων αἱ κρίσεις ἐν ἡμέραις γιγνέσθωσαν δέκα, παρ’ οἷς ἂν γένηται τὸ\r\nσυμβόλαιον (Dionys. vi. 95).\r\n\r\n[1403] Dionys. iii. 34, 51.\r\n\r\n[1404] ib. vi. 95; Festus p. 241.\r\n\r\n[1405] Dionys. viii. 70, 74.\r\n\r\n[1406] p. 295.\r\n\r\n[1407] App. _B.C._ i. 23. Dionysius (viii. 72) speaks of the Latins and\r\nHernicans exercising voting privileges (ψηφοφορία) in Rome in the year\r\n486 B.C. But it is impossible that they could have been enrolled in the\r\ncenturies, which was a Roman army list, and no assembly of the tribes had\r\nyet received state recognition.\r\n\r\n[1408] Dionys. viii. 69, 72, 74.\r\n\r\n[1409] Livy, by attributing _civitas_ to Tusculum (vi. 26) and calling\r\nthe Tusculans _cives_ (vi. 36), seems to imply that they were full\r\ncitizens. In this case the city could not have been from the first\r\na _municipium_, the name it bears later (“municipium antiquissimum”\r\nCic. _pro Planc._ 8, 19). Festus, however (p. 127), includes Tusculum\r\namongst the states with _civitas sine suffragio_, i.e. amongst the true\r\n_municipia_, and we know that Livy (x. 1) uses _civitas_ for _civitas\r\nsine suffragio_. The Satricani are _cives Romani_ in 319 B.C. (Liv. ix.\r\n16). Satricum had formerly belonged to the thirty Latin cities (Dionys.\r\nv. 61).\r\n\r\n[1410] Liv. viii. 14 “Ceteris Latinis populis (i.e. other than those with\r\nwhom special arrangements were made) conubia commerciaque et concilia\r\ninter se ademerunt.”\r\n\r\n[1411] Liv. ix. 43 “Hernicorum tribus populis, Aletrinati, Verulano,\r\nFerentinati, quia maluerunt quam civitatem, suae leges redditae;\r\nconubiumque inter ipsos, quod aliquamdiu soli Hernicorum habuerunt,\r\npermissum. Anagninis, quique arma Romanis intulerant, civitas sine\r\nsuffragii latione data: concilia conubiaque adempta, et magistratibus,\r\npraeterquam sacrorum curatione, interdictum.”\r\n\r\n[1412] p. 299.\r\n\r\n[1413] Dionys. vii. 13; Plut. _Cor._ 13.\r\n\r\n[1414] Hyginus p. 176 “cum signis et aquila et primis ordinibus ac\r\ntribunis deducebantur”; Tac. _Ann._ xiv. 27 “non enim, ut olim, universae\r\nlegiones deducebantur cum tribunis et centurionibus et sui cujusque\r\nordinis militibus.”\r\n\r\n[1415] Varro _L.L._ v. 143; Serv. ad _Aen._ v. 755.\r\n\r\n[1416] Liv. xxvii. 38 (207 B.C.) “colonos etiam maritimos, qui\r\nsacrosanctam vacationem dicebantur habere, dare milites cogebant”;\r\nxxxvi. 3 (191 B.C.) “contentio orta cum colonis maritimis ... nam, cum\r\ncogerentur in classem, tribunos plebei appellarunt.”\r\n\r\n[1417] Cic. _pro Balbo_ 11, 28; _pro Caec._ 34, 100.\r\n\r\n[1418] p. 203.\r\n\r\n[1419] Festus p. 233 “Praefecturae eae appellabantur in Italia, in\r\nquibus et jus dicebatur et nundinae agebantur; et erat quaedam earum res\r\npublica, neque tamen magistratus suos habebant; in quas legibus praefecti\r\nmittebantur quodannis, qui jus dicerent. Quarum genera fuerunt duo:\r\nalterum, in quas solebant ire praefecti quattuor, [qui] viginti sex virum\r\nnumero populi suffragio creati erant ... alterum, in quas ibant quos\r\npraetor urbanus quodannis in quaeque loca miserat legibus.” Amongst the\r\n_praefecturae_ which he enumerates are the Roman colonies of Volturnum,\r\nLiternum, Puteoli, and Saturnia.\r\n\r\n[1420] Liv. viii. 14 “Campanis ... Fundanisque et Formianis ... civitas\r\nsine suffragio data. Cumanos Suessulanosque ejusdem juris conditionisque,\r\ncujus Capuam, esse placuit.” For Atella and Calatia see Festus pp. 131,\r\n233.\r\n\r\n[1421] Liv. x. 1.\r\n\r\n[1422] ib. ix. 43, quoted p. 299.\r\n\r\n[1423] Festus p. 131 “municipes erant qui ex aliis civitatibus Romam\r\nvenissent, quibus non licebat magistratum capere sed tantum muneris\r\npartem, ut fuerunt Cumani, Acerrani, Atellani, qui et cives Romani\r\nerant et in legione merebant, sed dignitates non capiebant”; cf. p. 127\r\n“participes ... fuerunt omnium rerum ad munus fungendum una cum Romanis\r\ncivibus praeterquam de suffragio ferendo aut magistratu capiendo.” The\r\nwords “qui ex aliis civitatibus Romam venissent” in the first definition\r\ndo not describe the _municipes_ of historical times; they suggest a\r\npossible origin for the institution. These rights were first conditioned\r\nby domicile in Rome, but the condition was subsequently removed.\r\n\r\n[1424] p. 235.\r\n\r\n[1425] Festus p. 233, quoted p. 302.\r\n\r\n[1426] Liv. viii. 14.\r\n\r\n[1427] ib. xxiv. 19; xxvi. 6.\r\n\r\n[1428] The language of Livy makes it doubtful whether he conceives the\r\n_foedus_ to have continued after the _civitas_ had been conferred. They\r\nare different stages of rights, but he may mean them to be cumulative.\r\nIn xxxi. 31 we read “cum ... ipsos (Campanos) foedere primum, deinde\r\nconubio atque cognationibus, postremo civitate nobis conjunxissemus” (cf.\r\nxxiii. 5). The _civitas_ here is probably the full citizenship conferred\r\non individual Capuans. They are spoken of as _socii_ in 216 B.C. (xxiii.\r\n5), and though the word is sometimes loosely used, it harmonises in its\r\nliteral sense with the great constitutional privileges of the town.\r\n\r\n[1429] As at Arpinum (Cic. _ad Fam._ xiii. 11, 3).\r\n\r\n[1430] Festus p. 127 “quorum civitas universa in civitatem Romanam venit.”\r\n\r\n[1431] It did not possess any magistracy for secular purposes (Liv. ix.\r\n43 “magistratibus, praeterquam sacrorum curatione, interdictum”).\r\n\r\n[1432] “in ditionem” (Liv. xxxvii. 45), “in potestatem” (xxxix. 54).\r\n\r\n[1433] “in fidem” (ib. viii. 2).\r\n\r\n[1434] Polyb. xx. 9, 12 παρὰ Ῥωμαίοις ἰσοδυναμεῖ τό τε εἰς τὴν πίστιν\r\nαὑτὸν ἐγχειρίσαι καὶ τὸ τὴν ἐπιτροπὴν δοῦναι περὶ αὑτοῦ τῷ κρατοῦντι.\r\n\r\n[1435] Gell. x. 3, 19.\r\n\r\n[1436] _Dig._ 49, 15, 7, 1 “liber populus est is qui nullius alterius\r\npopuli potestati est subjectus.”\r\n\r\n[1437] _Lex Antonia de Termessibus_ i. 8.\r\n\r\n[1438] Plin. _Ep. ad Traj._ 92 (93).\r\n\r\n[1439] Cic. _in Verr._ iii. 6, 13; cf. App. _B.C._ i. 102 (ἐπὶ συνθήκαις\r\nἔνορκοι).\r\n\r\n[1440] _Dig._ 49, 15, 7, 1 “hoc adjicitur, ut intellegatur alterum\r\npopulum superiorem esse, non ut intellegatur alterum non esse liberum.”\r\nCf. Cic. _pro Balbo_ 16, 35 “Id habet hanc vim, ut sit ille in foedere\r\ninferior.”\r\n\r\n[1441] _Dig._ l.c. “is foederatus est item sive aequo foedere in\r\namicitiam venit sive foedere comprehensum est ut is populus alterius\r\npopuli majestatem comiter conservaret.”\r\n\r\n[1442] _Lex Agraria_ 1. 21 “socii nominisve Latini, quibus ex formula\r\ntogatorum [milites in terra Italia inperare solent].”\r\n\r\n[1443] Liv. xxii. 57; xxvii. 10 “milites ex formula paratos esse.”\r\n\r\n[1444] The number of troops required was decreed every year by the Senate\r\n(Liv. xli. 5 etc.), the consuls fixing the amount which each state was to\r\nsend in proportion to its fighting strength.\r\n\r\n[1445] Cic. _pro Balbo_ 9, 24.\r\n\r\n[1446] Cic. _pro Balbo_ 8, 21 “innumerabiles aliae leges de civili jure\r\nsunt latae; quas Latini voluerunt, adsciverunt.”\r\n\r\n[1447] Liv. xxxv. 7 (193 B.C.) “M. Sempronius tribunus plebis ... plebem\r\nrogavit plebesque scivit ut cum sociis ac nomine Latino creditae pecuniae\r\njus idem quod cum civibus Romanis esset.” The enactment was produced\r\nby the discovery that Roman creditors escaped the usury laws by using\r\nItalians as their agents.\r\n\r\n[1448] Macrob. _Sat._ iii. 17, 6.\r\n\r\n[1449] Cic. _pro Balbo_ 8, 20 “foederatos populos fieri fundos oportere\r\n... non magis est proprium foederatorum quam omnium liberorum.” For the\r\nformula of acceptance (“fundi—i.e. auctores—facti sunt”) cf. Festus p. 89.\r\n\r\n[1450] Cic. _pro Balbo_ 24, 54 “Latinis, id est foederatis.”\r\n\r\n[1451] The distinction is expressed in the familiar _socii ac nominis\r\nLatini_ (Liv. xli. 8), _socii et Latium_ (Sall. _Hist._ i. 17), and\r\nperhaps in _socii Latini nominis_, if this last expression is to be\r\nregarded as an asyndeton.\r\n\r\n[1452] These twelve colonies, with the dates of their foundations,\r\nare—Ariminum (268 B.C.), Beneventum (268), Firmum (264), Aesernia (263),\r\nBrundisium (244), Spoletium (241), Cremona and Placentia (218), Copia\r\n(193), Valentia (192), Bononia (189), Aquileia (181).\r\n\r\n[1453] The later Latin colonists have of right no _conubium_ with Rome\r\n(Ulp. _Reg._ v. 4 “Conubium habent cives Romani cum civibus Romanis; cum\r\nLatinis autem et peregrinis ita si concessum sit”). The change may have\r\ncome with this last outburst of Latin colonisation in Italy; but it may\r\nbe as late as the extension of _latinitas_ to the provinces. For the\r\nright of _commercium_ possessed by these colonies see Cic. _pro Caec._\r\n35, 102 “jubet enim (Sulla Volaterranos) eodem jure esse quo fuerint\r\nAriminenses, quos quis ignorat duodecim coloniarum fuisse et a civibus\r\nRomanis hereditates capere potuisse?”\r\n\r\n[1454] Appian (_B.C._ i. 23), speaking of C. Gracchus’ proposal to\r\nextend the citizenship, suggests a Latin right ψῆφον ἐν ταῖς Ῥωμαίων\r\nχειροτονίαις φέρειν. Livy, with reference to the year 212 B.C., speaks of\r\nthe _sortitio_ as to the tribe or tribes in which the Latins should vote\r\n(xxv. 3, in the trial of Postumius “sitella ... lata est ut sortirentur\r\nubi Latini suffragium ferrent”).\r\n\r\n[1455] Liv. xli. 8 “Lex sociis ac nominis Latini, qui stirpem ex sese\r\ndomi relinquerent, dabat ut cives Romani fierent.”\r\n\r\n[1456] This was the _latinitas_ given to Cisalpine Gaul in 89 B.C. by a\r\nlaw of the consul Cn. Pompeius Strabo. Ascon. _in Pison._ p. 3 “Pompeius\r\nenim non novis colonis eas (Transpadanas colonias) constituit, sed\r\nveteribus incolis manentibus jus dedit Latii, ut possent habere jus\r\nquod ceterae Latinae coloniae, id est ut gerendo magistratus civitatem\r\nRomanam adipiscerentur.” Consequently when Caesar refounded Comum in\r\nthis district, in accordance with the _lex Vatinia_ (59 B.C.), the new\r\n_civitas_ possessed this right (App. _B.C._ ii. 26).\r\n\r\n[1457] _Lex Acilia_ l. 77; Cic. _pro Balbo_ 24, 54. The probable dates of\r\nthese laws are 122 and 111 B.C. respectively.\r\n\r\n[1458] The allies before the social war reckon as their chief grievance\r\n“per omnes annos atque omnia bella duplici numero se militum equitumque\r\nfungi” (Vell. ii. 15).\r\n\r\n[1459] Liv. xlii. 1 “(L. Postumius Albinus) ... literas Praeneste\r\nmisit, ut sibi magistratus obviam exiret, locum publice pararet, ubi\r\ndeverteretur, jumentaque, cum exiret inde, praesto essent. Ante hunc\r\nconsulem nemo unquam sociis in ulla re oneri aut sumptui fuit ... Injuria\r\nconsulis ... et silentium ... Praenestinorum jus, velut probato exemplo,\r\nmagistratibus fecit graviorum in dies talis generis imperiorum.”\r\n\r\n[1460] C. Gracchus ap. Gell. x. 3, 3.\r\n\r\n[1461] App. _B.C._ i. 21 and 34. According to Valerius Maximus (ix. 5, 1)\r\nFlaccus proposed to give the _provocatio_ to those “qui civitatem mutare\r\nnoluissent.”\r\n\r\n[1462] App. _B.C._ i. 23. Plutarch makes it a simple proposal of\r\ncitizenship for the allies (_C. Gracch._ 5). The geographical limits of\r\nthese proposed extensions are unknown. Velleius (ii. 6) remarks vaguely,\r\nwith respect to the Gracchan law, “dabat civitatem omnibus Italicis,\r\nextendebat eam paene usque Alpis.”\r\n\r\n[1463] App. _B.C._ i. 35; he promised to reintroduce the law περὶ τῆς\r\nπολιτείας. Liv. _Ep._ lxxi. “socios et Italicos populos spe civitatis\r\nRomanae sollicitavit”; Vell. ii. 14 “Tum conversus Drusi animus ... ad\r\ndandam civitatem Italiae.”\r\n\r\n[1464] Diod. xxxvii. 2.\r\n\r\n[1465] Cf. the words of Pontius Telesinus, the Samnite leader in the\r\nlater struggle at the Colline gate (Vell. ii. 27), “eruendam delendamque\r\nurbem ... nunquam de futuros raptores Italicae libertatis lupos, nisi\r\nsilva, in quam refugere solerent, esset excisa.” This, however, is an\r\nexpression of Samnite rather than of Italian feeling.\r\n\r\n[1466] App. _B.C._ i. 49; Cic. _pro Balbo_ 8, 21.\r\n\r\n[1467] Only one clause of this law is known—that by which the _civitas_\r\nwas granted to _incolae_ enrolled on the registers of federate\r\ncommunities; they were to have the citizenship, if they made profession\r\nto the praetor within sixty days (Cic. _pro Arch._ 4, 7). It is difficult\r\nto believe that this cumbrous rule applied to the citizens of the towns.\r\n\r\n[1468] The gradual nature of the incorporation is attested by the\r\nexpression of Velleius (ii. 16), “paulatim deinde recipiendo in\r\ncivitatem, qui arma aut non ceperant aut deposuerant maturius, vires\r\nrefectae sunt.”\r\n\r\n[1469] Vell. ii. 20 “Itaque cum ita civitas Italiae data esset, ut in\r\nocto tribus contribuerentur novi cives, ne potentia eorum et multitudo\r\nveterum civium dignitatem frangeret plusque possent recepti in beneficium\r\nquam auctores beneficii, Cinna in omnibus tribubus eos se distributurum\r\npollicitus est.” Appian (_B.C._ i. 49) seems to speak of the creation\r\nof ten new tribes (δεκατεύοντες ἀπέφηναν ἑτέρας ἐν αἷς ἐχειροτόνουν\r\nἔσχατοι). The attempt to reconcile these accounts by supposing that they\r\nrefer to different classes of allies or are the respective products of\r\nthe two acts of legislation (Kubitschek _Imp. Rom. trib. descr._; Beloch\r\n_der Italische Bund_) receives some epigraphic support, but rests either\r\non a correction of Appian’s text or on the assumption that his account\r\nrefers to ten of the _old_ tribes.\r\n\r\n[1470] Liv. _Ep._ 84 “Novis civibus senatus consulto suffragium datum\r\nest,” a careless phrase of the epitomiser or copyist for the distribution\r\nthrough the tribes (Drakenborch). Sulla, in spite of his rescission of\r\nthe rights of certain rebel towns, did not disturb this arrangement.\r\n\r\n[1471] Augustus formed the plan of giving to the senates (_decuriones_)\r\nof the twenty-eight colonies which he founded in Italy the right of\r\nvoting for the magistrates at Rome. They were to send their votes under\r\nseal (Suet. _Aug._ 46).\r\n\r\n[1472] Liv. xxxviii. 36.\r\n\r\n[1473] Cicero says that his grandfather, in or just before the consulship\r\nof Scaurus (115 B.C.), “restitit M. Gratidio ... ferenti legem\r\ntabellariam” (_de Leg._ iii. 16, 36).\r\n\r\n[1474] _C.I.L._ i. p. 163.\r\n\r\n[1475] A fragment of a constitution of Tarentum, dating apparently from\r\na time not long subsequent to the _lex Julia_ of 90 B.C., has been\r\npreserved (_Fragmentum Tarentinum_ in _L’Année Épigraphique_, 1896, pp.\r\n30, 31). Arpinum was undergoing reorganisation in 46 B.C. (Cic. _ad Fam._\r\nxiii. 11, 3).\r\n\r\n[1476] Cic. _in Verr._ v. 13, 34 “unum illud, quod ita fuit illustre\r\nnotumque omnibus, ut nemo tam rusticanus homo L. Lucullo et M. Cotta\r\nconsulibus (74 B.C.) Romam ex ullo municipio vadimonii causa venerit quin\r\nsciret jura omnia praetoris urbani nutu ... Chelidonis ... gubernari.”\r\n\r\n[1477] Ascon. _in Pison._ p. 8.\r\n\r\n[1478] This is proved both by the attempt of Crassus, as censor in 65\r\nB.C., to place the Transpadanes on the register of citizens (Dio Cass.\r\nxxxvii. 9), and by Cicero’s comment on Marcellus’ action in scourging a\r\ncitizen of Novum Comum in 51 B.C. (Cic. _ad Att._ v. 11, 2 “Marcellus\r\nfoede in Comensi: etsi ille magistratum non gesserit, erat tamen\r\nTranspadanus”).\r\n\r\n[1479] Dio Cass. xli. 36.\r\n\r\n[1480] Cic. _ad Att._ v. 2, 3 “eratque rumor de Transpadanis, eos jussos\r\nIIIIviros creare. Quod si ita est, magnos motus timeo.”\r\n\r\n[1481] App. _B.C._ v. 3 τήν τε γὰρ Κελτικὴν τὴν ἐντὸς Ἄλπεων ἐδόκει\r\nΚαίσαρος ἀξιοῦντος (i.e. Octavianus after Philippi) αὐτόνομον ἀφιέναι,\r\nγνώμῃ τοῦ προτέρου Καίσαρος. Cf. iii. 30 and Dio Cass. xlviii. 12.\r\n\r\n[1482] The name given to the district in the law _Gallia Cisalpeina_,\r\n_Gallia cis Alpeis_ (cc. 22 and 23) suits both epochs equally well,\r\nfor Caesar had not made it a part of Italy. The fact that the _praetor\r\nurbanus_ is the central authority in jurisdiction (cc. 21 and 22) suits\r\nthe Augustan epoch better.\r\n\r\n[1483] _Lex Rubria_ cc. 21 and 22. For the _vadimonium_ cf. Cic. _in\r\nVerr._ v. 13, 34 (quoted p. 313).\r\n\r\n[1484] Generally _quattuorviri_, this board being usually divided into\r\ntwo magistrates with higher jurisdiction (_duumviri juri dicundo_) and\r\ntwo police officials (_duumviri aediles_). Sometimes we find _IIIIviri\r\ndicundo_, perhaps a designation for the joint board, or, where the\r\nmagistrates with aedilician power alone are referred to, _IIIIviri\r\naediles_ or _aedilicia potestate_. See Wilmanns _Index_ pp. 620-622.\r\n\r\n[1485] _Lex Julia mun._ l. 84. Cf. Cic. _in Pis._ 22, 51 “neque enim\r\nregio ulla fuit, nec municipium neque praefectura aut colonia, ex qua non\r\nad me publice venerint gratulatum.”\r\n\r\n[1486] Wilmanns _Index_ p. 618.\r\n\r\n[1487] Sicily, Sardinia, Hither and Further Spain, Illyricum, Macedonia\r\nand Achaea (separated by Caesar), Africa, Asia, Gallia Narbonensis,\r\nGallia Cisalpina, Bithynia, Cyrene with Crete, Cilicia and Syria.\r\n\r\n[1488] The number is given by Pliny (_H.N._ iii. 88). In Cicero’s time\r\nthere was about this number. He speaks of the appointment of 130 censors\r\n(_in Verr._ ii. 55, 137), two for each state (ib. 53, 133).\r\n\r\n[1489] Cassiodorus _Chron._ ad A.U.C. 670 “Asiam in XLIIII. regiones\r\nSulla distribuit.”\r\n\r\n[1490] Tac. _Ann._ iii. 44. This division may be the work of Augustus.\r\n\r\n[1491] pp. 244, 283.\r\n\r\n[1492] p. 245.\r\n\r\n[1493] Except that ownership of the soil is not always, as in Italy,\r\nthe ground of exemption from taxation. On the free city of Termessus in\r\nPisidia “free possession” is alone conferred.\r\n\r\n[1494] See the _lex Antonia de Termessibus_ (71 B.C.), especially the\r\nclause which confers autonomy “so far as is consistent with this charter”\r\n(i. l. 7 “eique legibus sueis ita utunto ... quod advorsus hanc legem non\r\nfiat”).\r\n\r\n[1495] Cic. _de Prov. Cons._ 3, 6. For the weakening of this respect for\r\nαὐτονομία in the Ciceronian period and Caesar’s attempt to strengthen it\r\nby law (probably the _lex Julia repetundarum_ of 59 B.C.) see Cic. _in\r\nVerr._ iii 89, 207; _in Pis._ 16, 37 (“lege Caesaris justissima atque\r\noptima populi liberi plane et vere erant liberi”).\r\n\r\n[1496] Festus p. 218.\r\n\r\n[1497] Cic. _in Verr._ ii. 13, 32; 15, 37; 16, 39; 24, 59.\r\n\r\n[1498] Liv. xlv. 17 and 32.\r\n\r\n[1499] Plin. _ad Traj._ 79 (83), 1.\r\n\r\n[1500] As Cicero did in his government of Cilicia. See _ad Att._ vi. 2,\r\n4 “omnes (civitates), suis legibus et judiciis usae, αὐτονομίαν adeptae,\r\nrevixerunt”; vi. 1, 15 “multaque sum secutus Scaevolae (governor of\r\nAsia _circa_ 98 B.C.); in iis illud, in quo sibi libertatem censent\r\nGraeci datam, ut Graeci inter se disceptent suis legibus ... Graeci vero\r\nexsultant quod peregrinis judicibus utuntur.”\r\n\r\n[1501] This we may gather from Cicero’s account of the proceedings of\r\nthe native magistrates in Cilicia (_ad Att._ vi. 2, 5 “Mira erant in\r\ncivitatibus ipsorum furta Graecorum, quae magistratus sui fecerant:\r\nquaesivi ipse de iis, qui annis decem proximis magistratum gesserant;\r\naperte fatebantur”).\r\n\r\n[1502] On the conquest of Epirus in 167 B.C., although all the Illyrians\r\nwere declared _liberi_, only some were pronounced “non solum liberi sed\r\netiam immunes” (Liv. xlv. 26).\r\n\r\n[1503] Cf. Tac. _Hist._ iv. 74 “nam neque quies gentium sine armis neque\r\narma sine stipendiis neque stipendia sine tributis haberi queunt.”\r\n\r\n[1504] Liv. xlv. 29.\r\n\r\n[1505] Cic. _pro Leg. Man._ 6, 14 “ceterarum provinciarum vectigalia,\r\nQuirites, tanta sunt ut iis ad ipsas provincias tutandas vix contenti\r\nesse possimus, Asia vero tam opima est et fertile ut ... facile omnibus\r\nterris antecellat.”\r\n\r\n[1506] Gaius ii. 7 “in eo (provinciali) solo dominium populi Romani\r\nest vel Caesaris, nos autem possessionem tantum vel usumfructum habere\r\nvidemur.” The theory is perhaps as old as the Gracchan period. C.\r\nGracchus’ association of the Asiatic taxes with the censor (cf. p. 231)\r\nmust have done a good deal to develop it. It is no wonder that this\r\ntheory led to the view that the provinces were “quasi quaedam praedia\r\npopuli Romani” (Cic. _in Verr._ ii. 3, 7).\r\n\r\n[1507] These expressions are known only from the literature of the\r\nEmpire; it may be a mere accident that in Republican literature\r\n_tributum_ seems never to be used of imperial taxation. The form\r\n_stipendium_ is preferred. In Liv. xxiii. 32 we have the _tributum_ of\r\nSardinia mentioned with reference to Republican times. The _venditio\r\ntributorum_ and the ὠναί of Cilicia (Cic. _ad Fam._ iii. 8, 5; _ad Att._\r\nv. 16, 2) probably refer to local taxes improperly sold to _publicani_.\r\n\r\n[1508] Liv. xliii. 2 “(Hispani) impetraverunt ne frumenti aestimationem\r\nmagistratus Romanus haberet.”\r\n\r\n[1509] p. 319.\r\n\r\n[1510] Cic. _in Verr._ iii. 33, 77.\r\n\r\n[1511] ib. ii. 13, 32; 26, 63, etc.\r\n\r\n[1512] ib. iii. 6, 12 “inter Siciliam ceterasque provincias ... in\r\nagrorum vectigalium ratione hoc interest, quod ceteris aut impositum\r\nvectigal est certum ... aut censoria locatio constituta est, ut Asiae\r\nlege Sempronia.”\r\n\r\n[1513] Cf. Cic. _ad Q. fr._ i. 1, 11, 33 “nomen autem publicani aspernari\r\nnon possunt, qui pendere ipsi vectigal sine publicano non potuerint, quod\r\niis aequaliter Sulla discripserat.” The reference is to Sulla’s temporary\r\nabolition of the Gracchan principle of collection.\r\n\r\n[1514] App. _B.C._ v. 4; Dio Cass. xlii. 6.\r\n\r\n[1515] Nothing seems to be known about the conditions of sale of the\r\nprovincial _portoria_, e.g. whether those of Asia were put up at Rome\r\nlike the _decumae_.\r\n\r\n[1516] Cic. _in Verr._ iii. cc. 81-96, 188-222.\r\n\r\n[1517] Cic. _in Verr._ iii. 70, 163. Cf. Liv. xxxvi. 2 “idem L. Oppio de\r\nalteris decumis exigendis in Sardinia imperatum.” Sometimes this enforced\r\nsale of corn (_frumentum imperatum_) was required from free cities such\r\nas Halaesa, Centuripae, and Messana in Sicily (Cic. _in Verr._ iii 73,\r\n170; iv. 9, 20).\r\n\r\n[1518] pp. 201, 202.\r\n\r\n[1519] p. 201.\r\n\r\n[1520] Sall. _Jug._ 27; Cic. _de Prov. Cons._ 2, 3; _pro Domo_ 9, 24.\r\n\r\n[1521] Cic. _ad Fam._ i. 9, 25.\r\n\r\n[1522] Cf. Cic. _de Prov. Cons._ 15, 87 (if the consul of 55 B.C.\r\nsucceeds Caesar on March 1, 54 B.C.) “Fuerit toto in consulatu sine\r\nprovincia, cui fuerit, antequam designatus est, decreta provincia?\r\nSortietur, an non? Nam et non sortiri absurdum est, et quod sortitus sis\r\nnon habere. Proficiscetur paludatus? Quo? Quo pervenire ante certam diem\r\nnon licebit. Januario, Februario provinciam non habebit. Kalendis ei\r\ndenique Martiis nascetur repente provincia.”\r\n\r\n[1523] Cic. _ad Fam._ i. 9, 25; xii. 4, 2.\r\n\r\n[1524] Cic. _in Verr._ i. 13, 34 “pecunia attributa, numerata est.\r\nProfectus est quaestor in provinciam (Verres). Venit exspectatus in\r\nGalliam ad exercitum consularem cum pecunia.”\r\n\r\n[1525] _Rationes referre_ (Cic. _in Verr._ i. 13, 36). In accordance with\r\na _lex Julia_ (perhaps _repetundarum_) of Caesar’s, the accounts had\r\nto be deposited at the _aerarium_, and two copies in two cities of the\r\nprovince (Cic. _ad Fam._ v. 20, 2; Plut. _Cato Min._ 38).\r\n\r\n[1526] p. 215.\r\n\r\n[1527] Cic. _in Verr._ iii. 58, 134 “Quaestores, legatos ... multi missos\r\nfecerunt et de provincia decedere jusserunt, quod illorum culpa se\r\nminus commode audire arbitrarentur aut quod peccare ipsos aliqua in re\r\njudicarent.”\r\n\r\n[1528] The transition is marked in 169 B.C. (Liv. xliv. 18 “Senatus Cn.\r\nServilio consuli negotium dedit, ut is in Macedoniam, quos L. Aemilio\r\nvideretur, legaret”).\r\n\r\n[1529] Cicero delegates even jurisdiction to one of his _comites_,\r\nVolusius (_ad Att._ v. 21, 6). Other members of his retinue were his\r\nson Marcus and his brother Quintus. These intimates of the governor\r\nwere spoken of as _contubernales_, _cohors_ _amicorum_, even as _cohors\r\npraetoria_ (Cic. _ad Q. fr._ i. 1, 4, 12), although this title was\r\nproperly applied to the governor’s military guard.\r\n\r\n[1530] p. 319, note 2.\r\n\r\n[1531] Cic. _in Verr._ ii. 13, 32 “Siculi hoc jure sunt ut, quod civis\r\ncum cive agat, domi certet suis legibus.”\r\n\r\n[1532] ib. “quod Siculus cum Siculo non ejusdem civitatis (agat), ut de\r\neo praetor judices ex P. Rupilii decreto ... sortiatur.”\r\n\r\n[1533] It is possible, however, that the principle here adopted was that\r\nthe _judex_ should be of the nationality of the defendant.\r\n\r\n[1534] Cic. l.c. “quod privatus a populo petit aut populus a privato,\r\nsenatus ex aliqua civitate, qui judicet, datur, cum alternae civitates\r\nrejectae sunt.”\r\n\r\n[1535] ib. “quod civis Romanus a Siculo petit, Siculus judex datur, quod\r\nSiculus a civi Romano, civis Romanus datur.”\r\n\r\n[1536] ib. “ceterarum rerum selecti judices ex conventu civium Romanorum\r\nproponi solent.”\r\n\r\n[1537] Cic. _ad Att._ vi. 1, 15 “multaque sum secutus Scaevolae; in iis\r\nillud, in quo sibi libertatem censent Graeci datam, ut Graeci inter\r\nse disceptent suis legibus ... Graeci vero exsultant quod peregrinis\r\njudicibus utuntur”; _ad Att._ vi. 2, 4 “omnes (civitates), suis legibus\r\net judiciis usae, αὐτονομίαν adeptae, revixerunt.”\r\n\r\n[1538] “Edictum Siciliense” (Cic. _in Verr._ i. 45, 117).\r\n\r\n[1539] Extreme changes might be made a ground of complaint by the\r\ndeparting governor. Thus Cicero writes from Cilicia (50 B.C.) “Appius\r\nenim ad me ex itinere bis terve ... literas miserat, quod quaedam a se\r\nconstituta rescinderem” (_ad Att._ vi. 1, 2).\r\n\r\n[1540] Cic. _ad Fam._ iii. 8, 4.\r\n\r\n[1541] Thus Cicero, governor of Cilicia, followed in some respects the\r\nedict of Mucius Scaevola, the former governor of Asia (Cic. _ad Att._ vi.\r\n1, 15).\r\n\r\n[1542] Cic. _ad Att._ vi. 1, 15 “unum (genus) est provinciale, in quo\r\nest de rationibus civitatum, de aere alieno, de usura, de syngraphis;\r\nin eodem omnia de publicanis. Alterum, quod sine edicto satis commode\r\ntransigi non potest, de hereditatum possessionibus, de bonis possidendis\r\nvendendis, magistris faciendis: quae ex edicto et postulari et fieri\r\nsolent. Tertium, de reliquo jure dicundo ἄγραφον reliqui. Dixi me de eo\r\ngenere mea decreta ad edicta urbana accommodaturum.”\r\n\r\n[1543] Cic. _ad Fam._ iii. 8, 6.\r\n\r\n[1544] Cic. _ad Att._ v. 21, 9.\r\n\r\n[1545] Cic. _ad Att._ v. 20, 1; _ad Fam._ iii. 8, 4 and 5.\r\n\r\n[1546] Suet. _Caes._ 7 “Quaestori (Caesari) ulterior Hispania obvenit;\r\nubi cum, mandatu praetoris, jure dicundo conventus circumiret, etc.”\r\nQuaestorian jurisdiction was more frequent in Sicily than in other\r\nprovinces, on account of the presence of the second quaestor at Lilybaeum.\r\n\r\n[1547] Cic. _ad Fam._ xii. 30, 7 “Illud non nimium probo quod scribis ...\r\nte tuis etiam legatis lictores ademisse.”\r\n\r\n[1548] Thus Verres quashes either a decision, or the execution of a\r\ndecision, given by his quaestor (Cic. _Div. in Caec._ 17, 56 “Lilybaeum\r\nVerres venit postea: rem cognoscit: factum improbat: cogit quaestorem\r\nsuum pecuniam ... adnumerare et reddere”).\r\n\r\n[1549] Possibly certain kinds of criminal jurisdiction were guaranteed to\r\ncities by the _lex provinciae_. The Senate of Catina in Sicily tried a\r\nslave (Cic. _in Verr._ iv. 45, 100).\r\n\r\n[1550] Cic. _in Verr._ i. 33, 84 (of an _émeute_ at Lampsacus) “Non te\r\nad senatum causam deferre ... non eos homines, qui populum concitarant,\r\nconsulum literis evocandos curare oportuit?”\r\n\r\n[1551] The council was not, however, legally necessary. Cf. Cic. _in\r\nVerr._ ii. 30, 75 “Reus plorare ... ut cum consilio cognosceret.”\r\n\r\n[1552] ib. ii. 29, 70; 30, 75.\r\n\r\n[1553] ib. ii. 30, 75 “hominem innocentem de sententia scribae, medici\r\nharuspicisque condemnat.”\r\n\r\n[1554] For the threat of capital punishment on a Roman citizen see Cic.\r\n_ad Q. fr._ i. 2, 5; for its apparent execution, Diod. xxxvii. 5, 2.\r\n\r\n[1555] Cic. _in Verr._ v. 66, 170 “Facinus est vincire civem Romanum;\r\nscelus, verberare: prope parricidium, necare: quid dicam in crucem\r\ntollere?” Cf. _pro Rab._ 5, 17.\r\n\r\n[1556] See p. 285.\r\n\r\n[1557] Cic. _de Rep._ v. 6, 8 (_ad Att._ viii. 11, 1); v. 7, 9.\r\n\r\n[1558] p. 224.\r\n\r\n[1559] p. 314.\r\n\r\n[1560] Caesar reduced the number of the recipients of the corn-dole from\r\n320,000 to 150,000 (Suet. _Caes._ 41). In the Principate it stood at\r\nabout 200,000. See Marquardt _Staatsverw_. ii. p. 118.\r\n\r\n[1561] p. 312.\r\n\r\n[1562] p. 311.\r\n\r\n[1563] It is true, however, that the Princeps was often made by an army,\r\nnot by _the_ army.\r\n\r\n[1564] Dio Cass. xlii. 20. The dictatorship of 49 B.C. had been held only\r\nfor eleven days and was probably conferred merely _comitiorum habendorum\r\ncausa_. See p. 193.\r\n\r\n[1565] Dio Cass. xliii. 14 and 33. It has been interpreted as a\r\ndictatorship _rei publicae constituendae causa_.\r\n\r\n[1566] _C.I.L._ i. p. 452.\r\n\r\n[1567] Plut. _Caes._ 61; _Ant._ 12; Cic. _Phil._ ii. 34, 85.\r\n\r\n[1568] Cf. Cic. _ad Fam._ xi. 27, 8 “si Caesar rex fuerit ... quod mihi\r\nquidem videtur.”\r\n\r\n[1569] Dio Cass. xliii. 44. Caesar probably used it after his name and\r\nnot as a _praenomen_, as stated by Suetonius (_Caes._ 76). It became with\r\nhim a kind of _cognomen_, and Augustus, who inherited it, changed its\r\nposition in the order of his names.\r\n\r\n[1570] Dio Cass. xliii. 14.\r\n\r\n[1571] Cic. _ad Fam._ xii. 1, 1 “nam, ut adhuc quidem actum est, non\r\nregno, sed rege liberati videmur.”\r\n\r\n[1572] _Monumentum Ancyranum_ i. 8-9 “Populus ... me ... trium virum rei\r\npublicae constituendae creavit.”\r\n\r\n[1573] App. _B.C._ v. 95.\r\n\r\n[1574] _Mon. Anc._ vi. 13-15 “In consulatu sexto et septimo, bella ubi\r\ncivilia exstinxeram, per consensum universorum potitus rerum omnium,\r\nrem publicam ex mea potestate in senatus populique Romani arbitrium\r\ntranstuli.”\r\n\r\n[1575] Dio Cass. xlix. 15.\r\n\r\n[1576] Tac. _Ann._ iii. 28 “sexto ... consulatu ... quae triumviratu\r\njusserat abolevit.”\r\n\r\n[1577] Cf. Tac. _Ann._ i. 2 “posito triumviri nomine.”\r\n\r\n[1578] _Mon. Anc._ l.c.\r\n\r\n[1579] ib. vi. 16 (after the words on p. 338 note 4) “Quo pro merito meo\r\nsenatus consulto Aug. appellatus sum.”\r\n\r\n[1580] Dio Cass. liii. 12. Augustus uses the expression _consulare\r\nimperium_ for his position at this time (_Mon. Anc._ ii. 5, 8). It\r\nresembled a proconsular command, but was held within the city. Compare\r\nthe position of Pompeius in 52 B.C.\r\n\r\n[1581] Strabo p. 840 ἡ πατρὶς ἐπέτρεψεν αὐτῷ τὴν προστασίαν τῆς ἡγεμονίας\r\nκαὶ πολέμου καὶ εἰρήνης κατέστη κύριος διὰ βίου.\r\n\r\n[1582] In the Calendar we find for January 13 (the day of the settlement)\r\n“quod rem publicam P. R. restituit” (_C.I.L._ i. p. 312). Cf. Ovid\r\n_Fasti_ i. l. 589 “redditaque est omnis populo provincia nostro”; Vell.\r\nii. 89 “prisca illa et antiqua rei publicae forma revocata.”\r\n\r\n[1583] Dio Cass. lii. 1 ἐκ δὲ τούτου μοναρχεῖσθαι αὖθις ἀρκιβῶς ἤρξαντο.\r\nIn the _Cenotaphia Pisana_ (A.D. 2) ii. l. 12 Augustus is called “custos\r\nimperi Romani totiusque orbis terrarum praeses” (Wilmanns n. 883).\r\n\r\n[1584] Dio Cass. liii. 32.\r\n\r\n[1585] Dio Cass. liii. 32.\r\n\r\n[1586] Dio Cass. liv. 10.\r\n\r\n[1587] ib. liii 32.\r\n\r\n[1588] _C.I.L._ vi. n. 930. It describes itself as a law and is generally\r\nknown as the _lex de imperio Vespasiani_. But its wording bears more\r\nanalogy to that of a _senatus consultum_. See Mommsen _Staatsrecht_ ii.\r\np. 878.\r\n\r\n[1589] _Vitae Macrini_ 7; _Alexandri_ 8; _Probi_ 12; _Maximi et Balbini_\r\n8.\r\n\r\n[1590] “Dato imperio” (_Vita Veri_ 4), “accepit imperium” (_Vita\r\nAlexandri_ 1). It is possible, however, that these are references\r\nmerely to the reception of the title _imperator_; cf. _Vita Juliani_ 3\r\n“imperator est appellatus”; _Vita Probi_ 12 “nomen imperatorium.” For\r\nthe view that there was always a _lex de imperio_ see Karlowa _Römische\r\nRechtsgeschichte_ i. pp. 493 ff.\r\n\r\n[1591] Gaius _Inst._ i. 5 (on the imperial _constitutio_) “nec unquam\r\ndubitatum est quin id legis vicem obtineat, cum ipse imperator per legem\r\nimperium accipiat”; Ulpian in _Dig._ 1, 4, 1 “Quod principi placuit,\r\nlegis habet vigorem: utpote cum lege regia, quae de imperio ejus lata\r\nest, populus ei et in eum omne suum imperium et potestatem conferat.” The\r\nview that these passages are interpolations is possible but hazardous.\r\nA genuine expression of belief in the _lex regia_ appears in Justinian\r\n(_Cod._ i. 17, l. 7).\r\n\r\n[1592] For the monopoly of the _sacramentum_ possessed by the Princeps\r\ncompare the charge brought against Agrippina after her death (59 A.D.),\r\n“Adiciebat crimina ... quod consortium imperii juraturasque in feminae\r\nverba praetorias cohortes ... speravisset” (Tac. _Ann._ xiv. 11).\r\n\r\n[1593] “Romae ruere in servitium consules, patres, eques” (Tac. _Ann._ i.\r\n7).\r\n\r\n[1594] Tac. _Hist._ i. 55 “Inferioris tamen Germaniae legiones sollemni\r\nKalendarum Januariarum sacramento pro Galba adactae.” For the renewal of\r\nthe oath on the anniversary of accession see Plin. _ad Traj._ 52.\r\n\r\n[1595] Cf. Tac. _Hist._ iii. 58 (Vitellius) “vocari tribus jubet, dantes\r\nnomina sacramento adigit.”\r\n\r\n[1596] _Lex de imp. Vesp._ 1 “foedusve cum quibus volet facere liceat.”\r\nThese powers are summed up by Dio Cassius liii. 17 (as imperators\r\nthe Emperors have the right) καταλόγους τε ποιεῖσθαι ... πολέμους τε\r\nἀναιρεῖσθαι καὶ εἰρήνην σπένδεσθαι.\r\n\r\n[1597] p. 283.\r\n\r\n[1598] Dio Cass. lx. 23 (after Claudius’ conquest of Britain) ἐψηφίσθη\r\nτὰς συμβάσεις ἁπάσας, ὅσας ἂν ὁ Κλαύδιος ἢ καὶ οἱ ἀντιστράτηγοι αὐτοῦ\r\nπρός τινας ποιήσωνται, κυρίας, ὡς καὶ πρὸς τὴν βουλὴν τόν τε δῆμον εἶναι.\r\n\r\n[1599] _Lex de imp.

See Mr. Strachan-Davidson in Smith _Dict. of Antiq._ ii. p.\r\n237.\r\n\r\n[1624] _Lex de imp._ Vesp. l. 10 “utique quos magistratum potestatem\r\nimperium curationemve cujus rei petentes senatui populoque Romano\r\ncommendaverit, quibusque suffragationem suam dederit promiserit, eorum\r\ncomitis quibusque extra ordinem ratio habeatur.” Cf.

Pertinax, after his appointment had been\r\naccepted by the praetorian guards, laid down his power in the Senate and\r\nwas elected again (Dio Cass. lxxiii. 1).\r\n\r\n[1679] Suet. _Vesp._ 6.\r\n\r\n[1680] _Vita Taciti_ 2 (after the murder of Aurelian) “exercitus, qui\r\ncreare imperatorem raptim solebat, ad senatum literas misit ... petens\r\nut ex ordine suo principem legerent.

Agrippa received _tribunicia potestas_ for five years\r\n(Dio Cass. liv. 12). For Tiberius’ claims see Tac. _Ann._ i 3 “filius,\r\ncollega imperii, consors tribuniciae potestatis adsumitur.”\r\n\r\n[1682] Tac. _Ann._ i 14 (Tiberius on his accession, A.D. 14) “Germanico\r\nCaesari proconsulare imperium petivit”; iii 56 (A.D. 22) “Tiberius mittit\r\nliteras ad senatum quis potestatem tribuniciam Druso petebat.” For Trajan\r\nsee Plin. _Paneg._ 8 “ante pulvinar Jovis optimi maximi adoptio peracta\r\nest ... simul filius, simul Caesar, mox imperator et consors tribuniciae\r\npotestatis”; _Vita Pii_ 4 “adoptatus est (Pius) ... factusque est patri\r\net in imperio proconsulari et in tribunicia potestate collega”; _Vita\r\nMarci_ 6 (Marcus before he came to the throne) “tribunicia potestate\r\ndonatus est atque imperio extra urbem proconsulari.”\r\n\r\n[1683] Mommsen _Staatsr._ ii. p. 1158.\r\n\r\n[1684] Vell. ii. 121 “cum ... senatus populusque Romanus postulante patre\r\nejus, ut aequum ei jus in omnibus provinciis exercitibusque esset quam\r\nerat ipsi, decreto complexus esset.”\r\n\r\n[1685] Agrippa twice declined a triumph offered him by Augustus (Dio\r\nCass. liv. 11 and 24), and the Senate conferred the title of _Imperator_\r\nonly on the proposal of the Princeps (Tac. _Ann._ i. 58, Germanicus\r\nin A.D. 15, “exercitum reduxit nomenque imperatoris auctore Tiberio\r\naccepit”).\r\n\r\n[1686] Mommsen _Staatsr._ ii. p. 1154.\r\n\r\n[1687] Suet. _Gaius_ 24 “(Gaius Drusillam) heredem quoque bonorum atque\r\nimperii aeger instituit.”\r\n\r\n[1688] ib. 14. Compare Domitian’s contention after the death of Vespasian\r\n“relictum se participem imperii sed fraudem testamento adhibitam” (Suet.\r\n_Dom._ 2).\r\n\r\n[1689] Tac. _Hist._ i. 15 (see p. 350); i. 17 (of the adoption of Piso by\r\nGalba) “consultatum inde pro rostris an in senatu an in castris adoptio\r\nnuncuparetur”; Suet. _Galba_ 17 “(Galba Pisonem) perduxit in castra ac\r\npro contione adoptavit.” Nerva proclaims on the Capitol his adoption of\r\nTrajan (Dio Cass. lxviii. 8).\r\n\r\n[1690] See p. 360, n. 2.\r\n\r\n[1691] p. 354.\r\n\r\n[1692] Plut. _Galba_ 7 (a messenger announces that) ὁ δῆμος καὶ ἠ\r\nσύγκλητος αὐτοκράτορα τὸν Γάλβαν ἀναγορεύσειεν: Herodian ii. 12 (the\r\nSenate) ψηφίζεται τὸν μὲν (Ἰουλιανὸν) ἀναιρεθῆναι, ἀποδειχθῆναι δὲ μόνον\r\nαὐτοκράτορα τὸν Σεουῆρον: _Vita_ _Maximini_ 15 “Ubi haec gesta sunt (i.e.\r\nafter the recognition of the Gordians) senatus magis timens Maximinum\r\naperte ac libere hostes appellat Maximinum et ejus filium.”\r\n\r\n[1693] This was the case with Caligula, although the _damnatio_ was\r\nincomplete. See Suet. _Claud._ 11 “Gaii quoque etsi acta omnia rescidit,\r\ndiem tamen necis, quamvis exordium principatus sui, vetuit inter festos\r\nreferri.”\r\n\r\n[1694] The deposed Nero was thus treated as a traitor (Suet. _Ner._ 49\r\n“codicillos praeripuit legitque se hostem a senatu judicatum et quaeri ut\r\npuniatur more majorum”).\r\n\r\n[1695] The _acta_ of Tiberius were not sworn to (Dio Cass. lix. 9),\r\nalthough his memory was not condemned. His reign appears amongst the\r\nlegitimate precedents for the authority of Vespasian in the _lex de\r\nimperio_, those of Gaius, Nero, Galba, Otho, and Vitellius being omitted.\r\n\r\n[1696] Dio Cass. lvii. 8 (Tiberius) ἐπὶ ταῖς τοῦ Αὐγούστου πράξεσι τούς\r\nτε ἄλλους πάντας ὥρκου καὶ αὐτὸς ὤμνυε.\r\n\r\n[1697] Tiberius characteristically enough would not have his _acta_ sworn\r\nto during his lifetime (Tac. _Ann._ i. 72; Suet. _Tib._ 67), and some\r\nthought the motive was “ne mox majore dedecore impar tantis honoribus\r\ninveniretur” (Suet. l.c.). His objection to his own deification was\r\ninterpreted by some as a sign “degeneris animi” (Tac. _Ann._ iv. 38).\r\n\r\n[1698] Dio Cass. iii. 20. Here it is made the age for entrance into\r\nthe Senate; but the completion of the twenty-fifth year is meant. Cf.\r\nQuintil. _Inst. Or._ xii. 6, 1 “quaestoria aetas.”\r\n\r\n[1699] Dio Cass. l.c. Dispensations from these rules might be given by\r\nthe Senate, in accordance with the _jus liberorum_ (“ut singuli anni\r\nper singulos liberos remittantur” _Dig._ 4, 4, 2), or to members of the\r\nimperial house (Tac. _Ann._ iii. 29 “Per idem tempus (A.D. 20) Neronem e\r\nliberis Germanici jam ingressum juventam (Tiberius) commendavit patribus,\r\nutque munere capessendi vigintiviratus solveretur et quinquennio maturius\r\nquam per leges quaesturam peteret ... postulavit”).\r\n\r\n[1700] Dio Cass. liv. 26; cf. Tac. _Ann._ iii. 29, quoted in the last\r\nnote.\r\n\r\n[1701] In inscriptions of the early Principate the vigintivirate is\r\nsometimes not found in the list of _honores_. But it is more probable\r\nthat it is omitted than that it was an alternative to the military\r\ntribunate. See Mommsen _Staatsr._ i. p. 544 n. 4.\r\n\r\n[1702] Dio Cass. lii. 20.\r\n\r\n[1703] Its use by Macrinus in the third century excited opposition (Dio\r\nCass. lxxviii. 13). See Mommsen _Staatsr._ ii. p. 942.\r\n\r\n[1704] Dio Cass. liv. 19 (of Tiberius in 16 B.C.) ἐστρατήγησε γάρ,\r\nκαίπερ τὰς στρατηγικὰς τιμὰς ἔχων (Tiberius had received the _ornamenta\r\npraetoria_ in 19 B.C., see c. 10); c. 32 Drusus ἀγορανόμος ... καίπερ τὰς\r\nστρατηγικὰς τιμὰς ἔχων ἀπεδείχθη: cf. c. 22.\r\n\r\n[1705] Suet. _Aug._ 35; Dio Cass. lviii. 12.\r\n\r\n[1706] Mommsen _Staatsr._ i. p. 458.\r\n\r\n[1707] The consular _insignia_ were granted to Nymphidius and to\r\nCrispinus under Nero (Tac. _Ann._ xv. 72; xvi. 17); the praetorian\r\n_insignia_ to Sejanus and to Macro under Tiberius (Dio Cass. lvii. 19;\r\nlviii. 12).\r\n\r\n[1708] Quaestorian _insignia_ were granted to Laco under Tiberius (Dio\r\nCass. lviii. 12).\r\n\r\n[1709] Tac. _Ann._ xii. 21 “consularia insignia Ciloni (procurator of\r\nPontus) ... decernuntur”; Suet. _Claud._ 24 “ornamenta consularia etiam\r\nprocuratoribus ducenariis indulsit.”\r\n\r\n[1710] As the praetorian _insignia_ to Pallas, the quaestorian to\r\nNarcissus (Tac. _Ann._ xii. 53; xi. 38).

But this incident, dating from A.D. 22, was the last of its\r\nkind on record.\r\n\r\n[1714] Suet. _Aug._ 38 “super triginta ducibus justos triumphos et\r\naliquanto pluribus triumphalia ornamenta decernenda curavit”; Wilmanns n.\r\n1145 l. 19 “senatus ... triumphalibus ornamentis honoravit auctore imp.\r\nCaesare Augusto Vespasiano”; _Index_ p. 609.\r\n\r\n[1715] Dio Cass. lix. 9. The obligation to swear _in acta Caesaris_ had,\r\nwith reference to the acts of the first Caesar, begun in 45 B.C. (App.\r\n_B.C._ ii. 106), and had been renewed during the triumvirate (Dio Cass.\r\nxlvii. 18), the formula running _se nihil contra acta Caesaris facturum_.\r\nFor the obligation as continued in the Principate cf. p. 363.\r\n\r\n[1716] Herodian (ii. 12), with reference to the downfall of Didius\r\nJulianus, speaks of the consuls οἷ τὰ τῆς Ῥώμης διοικεῖν εἰώθασιν ὁπηνίκα\r\nἂν τὰ τῆς βασιλείας μετέωρα ᾗ.\r\n\r\n[1717] Plut. _Galba 8._\r\n\r\n[1718] Tac. _Hist._ iii. 68.\r\n\r\n[1719] Plin. _Paneg._ 77 “comitia consulum obibat ipse (Trajanus);\r\ntantum ex renuntiatione eorum voluptatis quantum prius ex destinatione\r\ncapiebat....

The climax was reached with\r\ntwenty-five consulships in a single year (189 A.D.) under Commodus (Dio\r\nCass. lxxii. 12; _Vita Commodi_ 6).\r\n\r\n[1722] _Vita Alexandri_ 43.\r\n\r\n[1723] Pompon. in _Dig._ 1, 2, 2, 32.\r\n\r\n[1724] Marini _Atti Arvali_ p. 784.\r\n\r\n[1725] Dio Cassius, lii. cc. 20, 21 (speech of Maecenas), may mean to\r\nimply their existence in his own time.

(Dio Cass. xlviii. 43). Cf.\r\nTac. _Ann._ xvi. 34 “Tum ad Thraseam in hortis agentem quaestor consulis\r\nmissus.” They were selected by the consuls themselves (Plin. _Ep._ iv.\r\n15, 8).\r\n\r\n[1740] _Dig._ 1, 13, 1, 2 and 4 “sane non omnes quaestores provincias\r\nsortiebantur, verum excepti erant candidati principis ... qui ...\r\nepistulas ejus in senatu legunt.”\r\n\r\n[1741] Tac. _Ann._ xi. 22 (A.D. 47) “quaestura ... velut venundaretur.”\r\n\r\n[1742] The obligation imposed in 47 was modified in 54 A.D. (Tac. _Ann._\r\nxi. 22; xiii. 5), but was renewed under Domitian (Suet. _Dom._ 4).\r\n\r\n[1743] _Vita Alexandri_ 43 “quaestores candidatos ex sua pecunia jussit\r\nmunera populo dare ... arcarios vero instituit, qui de arca fisci ederent\r\nmunera eademque parciora.”\r\n\r\n[1744] The tribunate is to the younger Pliny “inanis umbra et sine honore\r\nnomen” (_Ep._ i 23).\r\n\r\n[1745] Tac. _Ann._ i. 77 (A.D. 15, on the proposal of _jus virgarum in\r\nhistriones_) “intercessit Haterius Agrippa tribunus plebei increpitusque\r\nest Asinii Galli oratione, silente Tiberio, qui ea simulacra libertatis\r\nsenatui praebebat.”\r\n\r\n[1746] Tac. _Hist._ iv. 9 (A.D. 69, on the praetors of the _aerarium_\r\nannouncing a deficit) “cum perrogarent sententias consules, Volcatius\r\nTertullinus tribunus plebis intercessit, ne quid super tanta re principe\r\nabsente statueretur.” This is the last recorded instance of the\r\n_intercessio_ (Momms. _Staatsr._ ii. p. 309 n. 1).\r\n\r\n[1747] Tac. _Ann._ vi. 47 [53] (in A.D. 37 a woman was accused of\r\n_majestas_) “qua damnata cum praemium accusatori decerneretur, Junius\r\nOtho tribunus plebei intercessit, unde ... mox Othoni exitium.” Rusticus\r\nArulenus, a _flagrans juvenis_, offered to veto the decree of the Senate\r\nwhich condemned Thrasea Paetus in A.D. 66 (xvi. 26).\r\n\r\n[1748] ib. xiii. 28 “inter Vibullium praetorem et plebei tribunum\r\nAntistium ortum certamen, quod immodestos fautores histrionum et a\r\npraetore in vincla ductos tribunos omitti jussisset.”\r\n\r\n[1749] Tac. _Hist._ ii. 91 (Vitellius, when Emperor, attacked by\r\nHelvidius Priscus in the Senate) “commotus ... non tamen ultra quam\r\ntribunos plebis in auxilium spretae potestatis advocavit.”\r\n\r\n[1750] In A.D. 56 they were forbidden “vocare ex Italia cum quibus lege\r\nagi posset” (Tac. _Ann._ xiii. 28). See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[1751] Tac. l.c.\r\n\r\n[1752] Juvenal vii. 228 “Rara tamen merces, quae cognitione tribuni\r\nNon egeat.” The words doubtless mean “which does not lead to the\r\n_appellatio_.” In such a case even the Republican tribunes took\r\n“cognisance” of the merits of the appeal. The explanation that the\r\ntribunes were now given some extraordinary jurisdiction in civil cases is\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\n[1753] p. 365.\r\n\r\n[1754] Dio Cass. liv. 26.\r\n\r\n[1755] ib. lx. 11.\r\n\r\n[1756] e.g. _Cod._ 6, 60, 1 (A.D. 319) “Imp. Constantinus A. consulibus,\r\npraetoribus tribunis plebis senatui salutem.”\r\n\r\n[1757] Suet. _Aug._ 40 “Comitiorum quoque pristinum jus reduxit.”\r\n\r\n[1758] p. 344.\r\n\r\n[1759] Dio Cass. lvi. 40 (Augustus) ἐκ ... τοῦ δήμου τὸ δύσκριτον ἐν ταῖς\r\nδιαγνώσεσιν ἐς τὴν τῶν δικαστηρίων ἀκρίβειαν μεταστήσας.\r\n\r\n[1760] e.g. the Julian laws passed by Augustus in the _concilium plebis_,\r\nthe _lex Junia Norbana_ of the reign of Tiberius, _plebiscita_ of\r\nClaudius. The last known _lex_ is an agrarian law of Nerva (_Dig._ 47,\r\n21, 3, 1).\r\n\r\n[1761] Dio Cass. liii. 21 (when the election was entrusted to the people,\r\nAugustus) ἐπεμελεῖτο ὅπως μήτ’ ἀνεπιτήδειοι μήτ’ ἐκ παρακελεύσεως ἤ\r\nκαὶ δεκασμοῦ ἀποδεικνύωνται. Cf. Tac. _Ann._ i. 15 “potissima arbitrio\r\nprincipis, quaedam tamen studiis tribuum fiebant.”\r\n\r\n[1762] Tac. _Ann._ i. 15. The change was, we are told by Velleius (ii.\r\n124), in accordance with the instructions of Augustus.\r\n\r\n[1763] p. 188.\r\n\r\n[1764] Dio Cass. lviii. 20.\r\n\r\n[1765] p. 349. In _C.I.L._ vi. 10213 we find a notice of “improbae\r\ncomitiae in Aventino, ubi (Sej)anus cos. factus est.” We find Vitellius\r\ncanvassing for his candidates in the circus (Tac. _Hist._ ii. 91 “comitia\r\nconsulum cum candidatis civiliter celebrans omnem infimae plebis rumorem\r\nin theatro ut spectator, in circo ut fautor adfectavit”). On the other\r\nhand, we have _ab senatu destinatus_ in the inscription quoted on p. 349\r\nn. 6. Dio Cassius (lix. 20), in speaking of the temporary restoration\r\nof popular elections by Caligula, mentions them in connexion with the\r\nconsulship.\r\n\r\n[1766] Dio Cass. xxxvii. 28.\r\n\r\n[1767] p. 369.\r\n\r\n[1768] p. 364.\r\n\r\n[1769] p. 365.\r\n\r\n[1770] p. 364. Hence the expression “nondum senatoria aetate” (Tac.\r\n_Ann._ xv. 28; _Hist._ iv. 42).\r\n\r\n[1771] Dio Cass. liv. 17, 30; Tac. _Ann._ i. 75, ii. 37.\r\n\r\n[1772] He declared “non lecturum se senatorem nisi civis Romani\r\nabnepotem” (Suet. _Claud._ 24).\r\n\r\n[1773] _Vita Commodi_ 6 “ad cujus (Cleandri) nutum etiam libertini in\r\nsenatum atque in patricios lecti sunt”; _Vita Elagabali_ 11 “Fecit\r\nlibertos praesides, legatos, consules, duces.”\r\n\r\n[1774] Tac. _Ann._ iii. 4 “simul novi homines e municipiis et coloniis\r\natque etiam provinciis in senatum crebro adsumpti”; Suet. _Vesp._ 9\r\n“Amplissimos ordines ... purgavit supplevitque, recenso senatu et equite\r\n... honestissimo quoque Italicorum ac provincialium adlecto.”\r\n\r\n[1775] Tac. _Ann._ xi 25; Prof. Pelham in _Classical Review_ ix. p. 441.\r\n\r\n[1776] Plin. _Ep._ vi. 19.\r\n\r\n[1777] _Vita Marci_ 11.\r\n\r\n[1778] For the infliction of such a _nota_ by Domitian see Suet. _Dom._\r\n8, “quaestorium virum, quod gesticulandi saltandique studio teneretur,\r\nmovit senatu.”\r\n\r\n[1779] p. 347.\r\n\r\n[1780] Tac. _Ann._ iv. 42 (Tiberius) “Apidium ...

Vesp._ l. 9 “ac si e lege senatus edictus esset\r\nhabereturque.”\r\n\r\n[1788] _Vita Gordianorum_, 11; _Vita Hadriani_, 7; Dio Cass. liv. 3.\r\n\r\n[1789] For the summons by a praetor see Tac. _Hist._ iv. 39; by tribunes,\r\nDio Cass. lvi. 47, lx. 16, lxxviii. 37; by tribunes and praetors, ib.\r\nlix. 24.\r\n\r\n[1790] The doubt is raised by Piso’s address to Tiberius during a trial\r\nfor _majestas_, “quo ... loco censebis, Caesar? Si primus, habebo quod\r\nsequar: si post omnes, vereor ne imprudens dissentiam” (Tac. _Ann._ i\r\n74). Dio Cassius also says of Tiberius (lvii. 7) καὶ γὰρ αὐτὸς ψῆφον\r\nπολλάκις ἐδίδου. But neither writer may be using strictly technical\r\nlanguage; and it is not certain that the Princeps could be _asked_ his\r\nopinion. On the other hand, when Caesar put the question, the other\r\nmagistrates gave _sententiae_ (Tac. _Ann._ iii. 17). The question is not\r\nof much importance for the Principate as a whole, as in its later period\r\nthe Emperor usually consulted the Senate by letter. See p. 369.\r\n\r\n[1791] See Tac. _Ann._ i. 74, quoted in the last note.\r\n\r\n[1792] p. 348.\r\n\r\n[1793] p. 359.\r\n\r\n[1794] p. 350.\r\n\r\n[1795] The formula for the formation of a _collegium legitimum_ runs\r\n“quibus senatus c(oire) c(onvocari) c(ogi) permisit e lege Julia ex\r\nauctoritate Augusti” (_C.I.L._ vi n. 4416).\r\n\r\n[1796] p. 372.\r\n\r\n[1797] Dio Cass. lxviii. 29.\r\n\r\n[1798] Tac. _Ann._ iii. 60; xii. 62.\r\n\r\n[1799] ib. xiii 48.\r\n\r\n[1800] “de legendo vel exauctorando milite, ac legionum et auxiliorum\r\ndescriptione” (Suet. _Tib._ 30).\r\n\r\n[1801] Tac. _Hist._ iv. 61; Dio Cass. lxviii. 9, 10. In 49 A.D. during\r\nthe reign of Claudius we also read of a reception of Parthian envoys in\r\nthe Senate (Tac. _Ann._ xii. 10).\r\n\r\n[1802] p. 358.\r\n\r\n[1803] p. 358.\r\n\r\n[1804] p. 372.\r\n\r\n[1805] p. 275.\r\n\r\n[1806] Thus the _S. C. Velleianum_, which limited the obligations which\r\nwomen might incur, begins, “Quod Marcus Silanus et Velleus Tutor consules\r\nverba fecerunt ... quid de ea re fieri oportet, de ea re ita censuere”\r\n(_Dig_. 16, 1, 2, 1); cf. _Dig._ 36, 1, 1, 2 (_S. C. Trebellianum_), 14,\r\n6, 1 (_S. C. Macedonianum_), and see Kipp _Quellenkunde des röm. Rechts_\r\np. 27.\r\n\r\n[1807] The jurists refer to them by the names of their proposers; hence\r\nsuch designations as _Velleianum_, _Trebellianum_ (see last note). But\r\nsuch designations are not official. The _S. C. Macedonianum_ is called\r\nafter the offender who had been the occasion of the decree.\r\n\r\n[1808] Gaius i. 4 “Senatus consultum est, quod senatus jubet atque\r\nconstituit: idque legis vicem obtinet, quamvis fuerit quaesitum.”\r\n\r\n[1809] _Dig._ 1, 1, 7; 1, 3, 9.\r\n\r\n[1810] _Lex de imp. Vesp._ 1. 17 “utique quaecunque ex usu rei publicae\r\nmajestateque divinarum humanarum publicarum privatarumque rerum esse\r\ncensebit, ei agere facere jus potestasque sit, ita uti divo Augusto ...\r\nfuit.”\r\n\r\n[1811] Tac. _Ann._ i. 77 “divus Augustus immunes verberum histriones\r\nquondam responderat, neque fas Tiberio infringere dicta ejus.”\r\n\r\n[1812] p. 363.\r\n\r\n[1813] Paulus in _Dig._ 28. 2, 26 “Filius familias, si militet ... aut\r\nheres scribi aut exheredari debet, jam sublato edicto divi Augusti, quo\r\ncautum fuerat ne pater filium militem exheredet.”\r\n\r\n[1814] It was sometimes used in a more general sense for _constitutio\r\nprincipis_, as when Papinian says “Jus ... civile est quod ex legibus,\r\nplebis scitis, senatus consultis, decretis principum, auctoritate\r\nprudentium venit” (_Dig._ 1, 1, 7).\r\n\r\n[1815] _Dig._ 4, 2, 13 “Exstat enim decretum divi Marci in haec verba,\r\netc.... Caesar dixit, etc.”\r\n\r\n[1816] “Rescript” is properly an _answer_ to a letter, but it soon came\r\nto be used as exquivalent to _epistola_. See Kipp _op. cit._ p. 37.\r\n\r\n[1817] Cf. _Dig._ 1, 16, 4, 5 “imperator noster Antoninus Augustus ad\r\ndesideria Asianorum rescripsit” (on the mode in which the proconsul\r\nshould arrive at the province of Asia).\r\n\r\n[1818] Gaius i. 5 “Constitutio principis est, quod imperator decreto\r\nvel edicto vel epistola constituit; nec unquam dubitatum est quin id\r\nlegis vicem obtineat.” Cf. Ulpian in _Dig._ 1, 4, 1, 1 “Quodcumque ...\r\nimperator per epistulam et subscriptionem statuit vel cognoscens decrevit\r\n... vel edicto praecepit, legem esse constat. Haec sunt quas vulgo\r\nconstitutiones appellamus.”\r\n\r\n[1819] Thus the soldier’s testament was created by a series of\r\nmandates: “divus Julius Caesar concessit ... divus Titus dedit: post\r\nhoc Domitianus: postea divus Nerva plenissimam indulgentiam in milites\r\ncontulit: eamque et Trajanus secutus est et exinde mandatis inseri coepit\r\ncaput tale. Caput ex mandatis, etc.” (Ulpian in _Dig._ 29, 1, 1).\r\n\r\n[1820] Gell. xii. 13, 1 “Cum Romae a consulibus judex extra ordinem datus\r\npronuntiare ... jussus essem.”\r\n\r\n[1821] Dio Cass. li. 19 (in 30 B.C. it was decreed) τὸν Καίσαρα τήν τε\r\nἐξουσίαν τὴν τῶν δημάρχων διὰ βίου ἔχειν ... ἔκκλητόν τε δικάζειν. It\r\nis probable that the last words only describe the establishment of the\r\nPrinceps as a high court of voluntary jurisdiction. See Greenidge in\r\n_Classical Review_ viii. p. 144.\r\n\r\n[1822] p. 368.\r\n\r\n[1823] Paulus in _Dig._ 5, 1, 58 “Judicium solvitur vetante eo qui\r\njudicare jusserat vel etiam eo qui majus imperium in eadem jurisdictione\r\nhabet.” The veto in virtue of _par potestas_ is here omitted on account\r\nof its disappearance in the time of Paulus (_circa_ 200 A.D.). See Merkel\r\n_Gesch. der klassischen Appellation_ ii. p. 19.\r\n\r\n[1824] Tac. _Ann._ i. 75 “judiciis adsidebat in cornu tribunalis, ne\r\npraetorem curuli depelleret; multaque eo coram adversus ambitum et\r\npotentium preces constituta”; Dio Cass. lvii. 7 ἐπεφοίτα δὲ καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ\r\nτῶν ἀρχόντων δικαστήρια, καὶ παρακαλούμενος ὑπ’ αὐτῶν καὶ ἀπαράκλητος,\r\nκαὶ ... ἔλεγεν ὅσα ἐδόκει αὐτῷ, ὡς πάρεδρος. The civil courts are here\r\nmeant, or at least included; but it is possible that Tiberius may often\r\nhave appeared in them as a self-constituted adviser, not as an authority\r\nto be appealed to; cf. Suet. _Tib._ 33 “magistratibus pro tribunali\r\ncognoscentibus plerumque se offerebat consiliarium; adsidebatque juxtim\r\nvel exadversum in parte primori.” According to Suetonius (l.c.) he\r\nexercised a similar influence over the jurisdiction of the _quaestiones_.\r\n\r\n[1825] p. 178.\r\n\r\n[1826] p. 382.\r\n\r\n[1827] Cic. _pro Tullio_ 16, 38 “quid attinuit te tam multis verbis\r\na praetore postulare ut adderet in judicium ‘INJURIA,’ et, quia non\r\nimpetrasses, tribunos plebis appellare et hic in judicio queri praetoris\r\niniquitatem quod de injuria non addiderit?” So the tribunician veto\r\nmight be employed to elicit an exception. Cic. _Acad. Prior._ ii. 30, 97\r\n“Tribunum aliquem censeo adeant [_al._ videant]: a me istam exceptionem\r\nnunquam impetrabunt.”\r\n\r\n[1828] Tac. _Ann._ xiii. 28 (A.D. 56). See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[1829] Dio Cass. lix. 8 ὁ μὲν γὰρ Τιβέριος οὕτως αὐτὸν (Silanus)\r\nἐτίμησεν, ὥστε μήτ’ ἔκκλητόν ποτε ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ δικάσαι ἐθελῆσαι, ἀλλ’ ἐκείνῳ\r\nπάντα αὖθις τὰ τοιαῦτα ἐγχειρίσαι. We do not know what position Silanus\r\nheld. If, as is generally supposed, he was consul, the reference may\r\nbe to appeals from jurisdiction in _fidei commissa_ delegated by the\r\nPrinceps to the consul.\r\n\r\n[1830] Suet. _Aug._ 33 “Appellationes quotannis urbanorum quidem\r\nlitigatorum praetori delegabat urbano: at provincialium consularibus\r\nviris, quos singulos cujusque provinciae negotiis praeposuisset.” That\r\nthe conjecture _praefecto delegabat urbis_ is untenable has been pointed\r\nout by Mommsen (_Staatsr._ ii. p. 985 note 1).\r\n\r\n[1831] For the delegation to praetors see p. 368; for that to consuls\r\ncf. Quint. _Inst. Or._ iii. 6, 70 “Non debes apud praetorem petere fidei\r\ncommissum sed apud consules, major enim praetoria cognitione summa est.”\r\n\r\n[1832] Tac. _Ann._ xiii. 4 “teneret antiqua munia senatus, consulum\r\ntribunalibus Italia et publicae provinciae adsisterent.”\r\n\r\n[1833] Cic. _in Verr._ iii. 60, 138; _ad Fam._ xiii. 26, 3; _Fragmentum\r\nAtestinum_ (Bruns _Fontes_) l. 10.\r\n\r\n[1834] When the Senate granted the _proconsulare imperium_ to Augustus in\r\n23 B.C. ἐν τῷ ὑπηκόῳ τὸ πλεῖον τῶν ἑκασταχόθι ἀρχόντων ἰσχύειν ἐπέτρεψεν\r\n(Dio Cass. liii. 32). Cf. Ulpian in _Dig._ 1, 16, 8 [“(proconsul) majus\r\nimperium in ea provincia habet omnibus post principem”] and in 1, 18,\r\n4. It is a passive rather than an active _majus imperium_ that is here\r\ncontemplated. The whole scheme of the provincial dyarchy rested on the\r\nassumption that there should be no relations between the proconsul and\r\nthe Princeps.\r\n\r\n[1835] p. 368.\r\n\r\n[1836] Ulpian in _Dig._ 49, 2, 1, 2 “sciendum est appellari a senatu non\r\nposse principem, idque oratione divi Hadriani effectum.” It was doubtless\r\nthe original principle, confirmed and not created by Hadrian.\r\n\r\n[1837] Tac. _Ann._ iii. 14, xvi. 8; Suet. _Aug._ 5.\r\n\r\n[1838] There was no legal principle of the kind. According to Dio Cassius\r\n(liii. 17) the monarchical power extended so far ὥστε καὶ ἐντὸς τοῦ\r\nπωμηρίου καὶ τοὺς ἰππέας καὶ τοὺς βουλευτὰς θανατοῦ δύνασθαι, and a\r\nsenator, like Calpurnius Piso in 20 A.D., might be brought before the\r\nEmperor (Tac. _Ann._ iii. 10). But Septimius Severus permitted a _senatus\r\nconsultum_ to be passed that the Emperor should not be allowed to put\r\na senator to death without the will of the Senate (Dio Cass. lxxiv. 2;\r\n_Vita Severi_ 7). The principle had been stated earlier by Hadrian (_Vita\r\nHadriani_ 7 “juravit se nunquam senatorem nisi ex senatus sententia\r\npuniturum”).\r\n\r\n[1839] Augustus in 29 B.C. brought Antiochus of Commagene, Tiberius in\r\nA.D. 17 Archelaus of Cappadocia before the Senate (Dio Cass. lii. 43,\r\nlvii. 17; Tac. _Ann._ ii. 42). In A.D. 19 Rhescuporis of Thrace was\r\naccused there (Tac. _Ann._ ii. 67).\r\n\r\n[1840] Cases of extortion are to be found in Tac. _Ann._ iii. 66,\r\nxii. 59; _Hist._ iv. 45. In A.D. 23 we find the imperial _procurator_\r\n(_patrimonii_) of Asia brought before the Senate for exceeding his powers\r\n(Tac. _Ann._ iv. 15).\r\n\r\n[1841] Tac. _Ann._ iv. 13 (A.D. 23) “Carsidius Sacerdos, reus tamquam\r\nfrumento hostem Tacfarinatem juvisset, absolvitur, ejusdemque criminis C.\r\nGracchus.”\r\n\r\n[1842] Amongst the prosecutions for treason against the Princeps which\r\ndisfigure the reign of Tiberius we may mention those against Libo Drusus\r\n(Tac. _Ann._ ii. 27 ff.), against Cremutius Cordus (ib. iv. 34, 35), and\r\nagainst Sejanus (Dio Cass. lviii. 9, 10).\r\n\r\n[1843] In A.D. 37 we find that a mother, who had caused her son to commit\r\nsuicide, “accusata in senatu ... urbe ... in decem annos prohibita\r\nest” (Tac. _Ann._ vi. 49). In A.D. 61 we find interdiction from Italy\r\npronounced against a man for a kind of _praevaricatio_, “quod reos, ne\r\napud praefectum urbis arguerentur, ad praetorem detulisset” (ib. xiv. 41).\r\n\r\n[1844] Quintil. _Inst. Or._ iii. 10, 1; vii. 2, 20. For instances see\r\nTac. _Ann._ ii. 50, iv. 21; Plin. _Ep._ ii. 11, 3 ff. In the last\r\npassage we find the question of the legality of this procedure raised\r\n(“Respondit Fronto Catius deprecatusque est ne quid ultra repetundarum\r\nlegem quaereretur.... Magna contentio, magni utrimque clamores, aliis\r\ncognitionem senatus lege conclusam, aliis liberam solutamque dicentibus”).\r\n\r\n[1845] It is possible, however, that the Senate was held to continue the\r\nextraordinary criminal jurisdiction of the _comitia_. Tacitus certainly\r\nregards the _cognitio_ as belonging to the Senate (_Ann._ ii. 28 “Statim\r\ncorripit reum, adit consules, cognitionem senatus poscit”).\r\n\r\n[1846] Plin. _Ep._ vi. 31, 8 (in a case of a forgery of a will) “Heredes,\r\ncum Caesar (Trajanus) esset in Dacia, communiter epistula scripta,\r\npetierant ut susciperet cognitionem.”\r\n\r\n[1847] Tac. _Ann._ ii. 79 “Marsus ... Vibius nuntiavit Pisoni Romam ad\r\ndicendam causam veniret. Ille eludens respondit adfuturum, ubi praetor,\r\nqui de veneficiis quaereret, reo atque accusatoribus diem prodixisset”;\r\nib. iii 10 “petitum ... est a principe cognitionem exciperet; quod ne\r\nreus quidem abnuebat, studia populi et patrum metuens ... haud fallebat\r\nTiberium moles cognitionis quaque ipse fama distraheretur. Igitur paucis\r\nfamiliarium adhibitis minas accusantium et hinc preces audit integramque\r\ncausam ad senatum remittit.” “Remittit” does not imply that the Senate\r\nwas bound to take the case. For the technically voluntary nature of its\r\njurisdiction cf. ib. iv. 21, xiii. 10, where we find the expressions\r\n“receptus est reus,” “recepti sunt inter reos.”\r\n\r\n[1848] Dio Cass. lii. 22, 33. A case of adultery of a centurion with\r\na tribune’s wife comes before the Emperor. Trajan stated the ground\r\non which he tried this case (Plin. _Ep._ vi. 31, 6 “Caesar et nomen\r\ncenturionis et commemorationem disciplinae militaris sententiae adjecit,\r\nne omnes ejusmodi causas revocare ad se videretur”).\r\n\r\n[1849] An instance is mentioned by Pliny (_Ep._ vii. 6, 8 “mater, amisso\r\nfilio ... libertos ejus eosdemque coheredes suos falsi et veneficii reos\r\ndetulerat ad principem judicemque impetraverat Julium Servianum”).\r\n\r\n[1850] See the section on the functionaries of the Princeps (p. 406 sq.).\r\n\r\n[1851] Plin. _ad Traj._ 96, 4 “quia cives Romani erant, adnotavi in urbem\r\nremittendos.”\r\n\r\n[1852] It is not properly an appeal but a denial of jurisdiction. But on\r\nwhat ground the jurisdiction of the procurator was denied is not clear.\r\nThe Roman citizenship, in virtue of which St. Paul claimed exemption from\r\nscourging at Philippi and Jerusalem, is not mentioned here. See _Class.\r\nRev._ x. p. 231.\r\n\r\n[1853] Plin. _Ep._ ii. 11; Suet. _Galba_ 9.\r\n\r\n[1854] For its attachment to procurators and to persons with\r\nextraordinary commands see the instances given by Mommsen (_Staatsr._\r\nii p. 270). So the praefectures of the guard, the _vigiles_ and the\r\nfleet, are _honores juris gladii_ (_Vita Alex._ 49). In the case of\r\nordinary provincial governors it is, perhaps, safer to say that the _jus\r\ngladii_ is possessed by them, or permitted to them, rather than that it\r\nwas attached to them by the Princeps (Ulp. in _Dig._ 1, 18, 6, 8 “qui\r\nuniversas provincias regunt, jus gladii habent et in metallum dandi\r\npotestas iis permissa est”).\r\n\r\n[1855] Dio Cass. lii. 22, 33; _Dig._ 48, 19, 27, 1 and 2.\r\n\r\n[1856] Even by Tiberius’ reign this procedure had become so formal that\r\na rule was framed for its exercise. A definite interval was prescribed\r\nwithin which the Princeps might consider the request for the intercession\r\n(Tac. _Ann._ iii. 51 [A.D. 21] “factum senatus consultum, ne decreta\r\npatrum ante diem _decimum_ ad aerarium deferrentur idque vitae spatium\r\ndamnatis prorogaretur”; cf. Dio Cass. lvii. 20; Suet. _Tib._ 75).\r\n\r\n[1857] p. 385.\r\n\r\n[1858] “Ob laetitiam aliquam vel honorem domus divinae vel ex aliqua\r\ncausa, ex qua senatus censuit abolitionem reorum fieri” (Ulp. in _Dig._\r\n48, 16, 12; cf. 48, 3, 2, 1). Domitian by an edict declared that such\r\n_abolitiones_ did not extend to slaves who were in custody awaiting trial\r\n(_Dig._ 48, 16, 16; cf. 48, 3, 2, 1).\r\n\r\n[1859] p. 249.\r\n\r\n[1860] Ulp. in _Dig._ 3, 1, 1, 10 “De qua autem restitutione praetor\r\nloquitur? Utrum de ea quae a principe vel a senatu? Pomponius quaerit: et\r\nputat de ea restitutione sensum, quam princeps vel senatus indulsit.”\r\n\r\n[1861] It is said of Claudius (Suet. _Claud._ 12) “neminem exulum nisi\r\nex senatus auctoritate restituit”; and of Antoninus Pius (_Vita_ 6) “His\r\nquos Hadrianus damnaverat in senatu indulgentias petit, dicens etiam\r\nipsum Hadrianum hoc fuisse facturum.”\r\n\r\n[1862] Such acts are mentioned under Claudius (Dio Cass. lx. 4), Otho\r\n(Tac. _Hist._ i. 90; Plut. _Otho_ 1), Vitellius (Tac. _Hist._ ii. 92),\r\nVespasian (Dio Cass. lxvi. 9), Nerva (Plin. _Ep._ iv. 9, 2), Antoninus\r\nCaracalla (_Vita_ 3), and Gordian (Herodian vii. 6, 4).\r\n\r\n[1863] Tac. _Ann._ ii. 50 “(Tiberius) liberavit ... Appuleiam lege\r\nmajestatis, adulterii graviorem poenam deprecatus.”\r\n\r\n[1864] p. 390.\r\n\r\n[1865] Gordian is spoken of as παλινδικίαν διδοὺς τοῦς ἀδίκως\r\nκατακριθεῖσι (Herodian vii. 6, 4).\r\n\r\n[1866] Ulp. in _Dig._ 3, 1, 1, 10.\r\n\r\n[1867] Suet. _Claud._ 14 “(Claudius) iis, qui apud privatos judices pius\r\npetendo formula excidissent, restituit actiones”; _Dom._ 8 “(Domitianus)\r\nambitiosas centumvirorum sententias rescidit.”\r\n\r\n[1868] This power was employed by Augustus (Suet. _Aug._ 32 “Diuturnorum\r\nreorum ... nomina abolevit”), Gaius (Suet. _Calig._ 15 “criminum ... si\r\nquae residua ex priore tempore manebant, omnium gratiam fecit”; cf. Dio\r\nCass. lix. 6), Vespasian (Dio Cass. lxvi. 9), and Domitian (Suet. _Dom._\r\n9).\r\n\r\n[1869] p. 388.\r\n\r\n[1870] Cic. _in Vat._ 14, 33.\r\n\r\n[1871] p. 390.\r\n\r\n[1872] _Dig._ 48, 19, 9, 11 “referre ad principem debet, ut ex\r\nauctoritate ejus poena aut permutetur aut liberaretur.”\r\n\r\n[1873] The capital punishment of decurions was prohibited by Hadrian\r\n(_Dig._ 48, 19, 15), and the earliest _mandata_, directing the procedure\r\nof governors in such cases, proceed from the _divi fratres_ (ib. 48, 19,\r\n27, 1 and 2). The punishment of deportation had been confined to the\r\nPrinceps and the praefects of the praetorian guard and the city by the\r\ntime of Septimius Severus (ib. 48, 19, 2, 1 and 48, 22, 6, 1; cf. § 7).\r\n\r\n[1874] Pliny often raises this question in his correspondence with Trajan\r\n(31 [40], 4; 56 [64], 3; 57 [65], 1). The passages seem to show (i.) that\r\nthere was at the time no fixed rule defining the governor’s power of\r\n_restitutio_, at least in public provinces; (ii.) that _restitutio_ by a\r\ngovernor was felt to be permissible in certain cases.\r\n\r\n[1875] A passage in Justinian’s _Code_ (9, 51, 1) shows us Antoninus\r\n(Caracalla) saying to a man, who had been deported to an island,\r\n“Restituo te in integrum provinciae tuae.”\r\n\r\n[1876] Greenidge in _Classical Review_ viii. p. 437.\r\n\r\n[1877] Cf. Tac. _Ann._ iii. 53 (quoted p. 352).\r\n\r\n[1878] Dio Cass. xliii. 48; Momms. _Staatsr._ ii. p. 557.\r\n\r\n[1879] Tac. _Ann._ xiii. 29; Dio Cass. liii. 2; Suet. _Aug._ 36.\r\n\r\n[1880] Tac. l.c.; Dio Cass. liii. 32.\r\n\r\n[1881] Tac. l.c.; Dio Cass. lx. 24; Suet. _Claud._ 24. For the election\r\nby the Princeps see the inscription to Ti. Domitius Decidius “electo\r\n(Mommsen, “adlecto” Wilmanns) a T. Claudio Caesare ... qui primus\r\nquaestor per triennium citra ordinem praeesset aerario Saturni” (Wilmanns\r\nn. 1135).\r\n\r\n[1882] Momms. _Staatsr._ ii. p. 559.\r\n\r\n[1883] Tac. l.c.; Mommsen l.c.\r\n\r\n[1884] Dio Cass. lxxi. 33 καὶ χρήματα ἐκ τοῦ δημοσίου ᾔτησε τὴν βουλήν.\r\n\r\n[1885] For the meaning of the word—the great basket in which money was\r\nkept in the state treasuries—see Mommsen _Staatsr._ ii. p. 998 n. 1. At\r\nthe beginning of the Principate there were, perhaps, fisci rather than a\r\n_fiscus_ (cf. Suet. _Aug._ 101), although there must always have been a\r\ncentral controlling department.\r\n\r\n[1886] Tiberius in 23 B.C. says of Lucilius Capito, procurator of Asia,\r\n“non se jus nisi in servitia et pecunias familiares dedisse” (Tac. _Ann._\r\niv. 15). He was doubtless a “procurator patrimonii.” Cf. Tac. _Ann._\r\nxii. 60 (“cum Claudius libertos, quos rei familiari praefecerat, sibique\r\net legibus adaequaverit”); xiii. 1 “P. Celer eques Romanus et Helius\r\nlibertus, rei familiari principis in Asia inpositi.”\r\n\r\n[1887] Marquardt _Staatsverwaltung_ ii. p. 256.\r\n\r\n[1888] _Vita Severi_ 12 “interfectis innumeris Abani partium viris ...\r\nomnium bona publicata sunt.... Tuncque primum privatarum rerum procuratio\r\nconstituta est.” The ordinarily accepted view of the relations of these\r\ntwo departments to one another is that of Hirschfeld and Marquardt,\r\nviz. that the _patrimonium_ was the inalienable crown property, the\r\n_res privata_ the strictly personal property of the Princeps. Karlowa\r\n(_Rechtsgeschichte_ i. p. 505) takes an exactly oppositive view of\r\ntheir relations, based partly on the fact that extant inscriptions show\r\nthe _procurator rationis privatae_ to have had a higher rank than the\r\n_procurator patrimonii_.\r\n\r\n[1889] _Mon.

He shows that the\r\ntransitory usurpation of the copper coinage by Nero was due to the same\r\ndesire of making a profit as his reduction of the value of silver.\r\n\r\n[1898] _Dig._ 2, 15, 8 “divus Marcus oratione in senatu recitata effecit\r\nne, etc.” Cf. 24, 1, 23; 27, 9, 1.\r\n\r\n[1899] Tacitus (_Ann._ vi. 2 [8]) remarks, with reference to proposals\r\ncarried in the Senate in 32 A.D., “et bona Sejani ablata aerario ut in\r\nfiscum cogerentur, tanquam referret.”\r\n\r\n[1900] Suet. _Aug._ 38 “Liberis senatorum, quo celerius rei publicae\r\nassuescerent, protinus ... latum clavum induere et curiae interesse\r\npermisit.”\r\n\r\n[1901] Wilmanns _Index_ p. 602; cf. Suet. _Dom._ 10.\r\n\r\n[1902] Augustus had given the post of _praefectus alae_ as well as that\r\nof _tribunus militum_ to senators’ sons (Suet. _Aug._ 38). Mommsen\r\n(_Staatsr._ i. p. 548) thinks that after Tiberius these _laticlavii_, as\r\na rule, filled the office of tribune alone. They could scarcely have been\r\ngiven a real command when they first joined the standards.\r\n\r\n[1903] The poet Ovid, who assumed the _latus clavus_ by right of birth,\r\ntook the first steps towards a senatorial career by filling two posts in\r\nthe vigintivirate, but he went no further and subsided into equestrian\r\nrank (Ovid _Trist._ iv. 10, 29; _Fasti_ iv. 383).\r\n\r\n[1904] Suet. _Claud._ 24 “Senatoriam dignitatem recusantibus equestrem\r\nquoque ademit.”\r\n\r\n[1905] Suet. _Claud._ 24 “Latum clavum (quamvis initio affirmasset non\r\nlecturum se senatorem nisi civis Romani abnepotem) etiam libertini filio\r\ntribuit, sed sub conditione si prius ab equite Romano adoptatus esset.”\r\nClaudius then appealed to the famous precedent set by his ancestor Appius\r\nCaecus.\r\n\r\n[1906] _Dig._ 23, 2, 44.\r\n\r\n[1907] ib. 1, 9, 8; 50, 1, 22, 5.\r\n\r\n[1908] ib. 1, 9, §§ 5, 6, 7, 10.\r\n\r\n[1909] Asc. _in or._ _in Tog._ _Cand._ p. 94.\r\n\r\n[1910] Dio Cass. lxix. 16 ἐνομοθέτησε δὲ ... ἵνα μηδεὶς βουλευτὴς μητ’\r\nαὐτὸς μήτε δι’ ἑτέρου τέλος τι μισθῶται.\r\n\r\n[1911] Severus Alexander at first forbade the taking of interest, but\r\nsubsequently allowed 6 per cent (_Vita_ 26). For investment by a senator\r\nat an earlier period cf. Plin. _Ep._ iii. 19, 8 “sum quidem prope totus\r\nin praediis, aliquid tamen fenero.”\r\n\r\n[1912] _Dig._ 50, 1, 23 “municeps esse desinit senatoriam adeptus\r\ndignitatem, quantum ad munera; quantum vero ad honorem, retinere creditur\r\noriginem.” Cf. ib. 1, 9, 11; 50, 1, 22, 5; _Cod._ 10, 40 [39], 8.\r\n\r\n[1913] p. 387.\r\n\r\n[1914] Friedländer _Sittengesch._ i. 3.\r\n\r\n[1915] Dio Cass. lii. cc. 7, 15, 31; lxvii. 2.\r\n\r\n[1916] See p. 413.\r\n\r\n[1917] p. 364.\r\n\r\n[1918] p. 374.\r\n\r\n[1919] Suet. _Claud._ 25 “stipendiaque instituit (Claudius) et\r\nimaginariae militiae genus, quod vocatur ‘supra numerum,’ quo absentes et\r\ntitulo tenus fungerentur.”\r\n\r\n[1920] In A.D. 16 a proposal was made in the Senate “ut ... legionum\r\nlegati, qui ante praeturam ea militia fungebantur, jam tum praetores\r\ndestinarentur” (Tac. _Ann._ ii. 36).\r\n\r\n[1921] Galba’s is a good instance of a distinguished senatorial career.\r\nHe obtained office _ante legitimum tempus_; after the praetorship he\r\ngoverned Aquitania, after the consulship Upper Germany; he was then\r\nproconsul of Africa, and finally for eight years legate of Tarraconensis.\r\nSee Suet. _Galba_ 6, 7, 8.\r\n\r\n[1922] Tac. _Ann._ iv. 6 “(the state contracts) societatibus equitum\r\nRomanorum agitabantur.”\r\n\r\n[1923] Dio Cass. liii. 30. On Antonius Musa, who had saved Augustus’\r\nlife, was conferred τὸ χρυσοῖς δακτυλίοις (ἀπελεύθερος γὰρ ἦν) χρῆσθαι:\r\nib. xlviii. 45 (Augustus, on the reception of Menas the former freedman\r\nof Sex. Pompeius) δακτυλίοις τε χρυσοῖς ἐκόσμησε καὶ ἐς τὸ τῶν ἱππέων\r\nτέλος ἐσέγραψε. These words _may_ mean that Menas was made an _eques equo\r\npublico_ as well.\r\n\r\n[1924] A rescript of Hadrian is quoted with reference to the _ingenuitas_\r\nconferred by the gold ring (Ulp. in _Dig._ 40, 10, 6). For other\r\nreferences to this right see _Dig._ 38, 2, 3; Justin. _Nov._ 78.\r\n\r\n[1925] The usurpation of the gold ring by freedmen, which was repressed\r\nby Claudius (Suet. _Claud._ 25) and Domitian, and the inspection in\r\nthe theatre instituted by the latter (Martial v. 8) seem to refer to\r\na civil class; at least there is no evidence that such people claimed\r\nto be _equites equo publico_. When Dio Cassius (lvi. 42) speaks of οἵ\r\nτε ἱππεῖς, οἵ τε ἐκ τοῦ τέλους καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι, it is not clear who “the\r\nothers” are, but the passage shows that persons other than those in the\r\ncorps were called “equites.”\r\n\r\n[1926] Dionys. vi. 13.\r\n\r\n[1927] The _seviri_ would seem to show that there were six _turmae_. See\r\nHirschfeld _Verwaltungsgesch._ p. 243 n. 1.\r\n\r\n[1928] Hence such expressions as _a divo Hadriano equo publico honoratus_\r\n(Wilmanns 1825), _equo publico exornatus ab Impp. Severo et Antonino\r\nAugg._ (ib. 1595).\r\n\r\n[1929] p. 347.\r\n\r\n[1930] p. 225. It is probable that the revision of the knights described\r\nin Suet. _Claud._ 16, _Vesp._ 9 refers to the censorship of these\r\nemperors.\r\n\r\n[1931] _a censibus equitum Romanorum_ (Wilmanns 1275), _a censibus a\r\nlibellis Aug._ (ib. 1249 b), _a libellis et censibus_ (ib. 1257).\r\n\r\n[1932] p. 225.\r\n\r\n[1933] Suet. _Aug._ 38 “equitum turmas frequenter recognovit, post longam\r\nintercapedinem reducto more transvectionis.”\r\n\r\n[1934] ib. 38 “mox reddendi equi gratiam fecit eis, qui majores annorum\r\nquinque et triginta retinere eum nollent.”\r\n\r\n[1935] ib. 39 “Unum quemque equitum rationem vitae reddere coegit.”\r\n\r\n[1936] Suet. _Calig._ 16 “palam adempto equo, quibus aut probri aliquid\r\naut ignominiae inesset.”\r\n\r\n[1937] Suet. _Aug._ 37, 39.\r\n\r\n[1938] In those of Caligula (Suet. _Calig._ 16) and Nero (Dio Cass.\r\nlxiii. 13), and perhaps in those of Vitellius (Tac. _Hist._ ii. 62) and\r\nSeverus Alexander (_Vita_ 15).\r\n\r\n[1939] Zosimus ii. 29.\r\n\r\n[1940] By the side of such titles as _equo publico judex selectus ex\r\nV decuriis_ (Wilmanns 2110) and _equum publicum habens adlectus in V\r\ndecurias_ (ib. 2203) we find the title _quin. decur. judi(cum) (inter)\r\nquatringenarios_ (Henzen 6469), in which a purely monetary qualification\r\nis expressed.\r\n\r\n[1941] Wilmanns nn. 1639, 2841, _Index_ p. 564; Mommsen _Staatsr._ iii.\r\np. 565.\r\n\r\n[1942] Wilmanns n. 2858; Mommsen ib. n. 3.\r\n\r\n[1943] These might have been included in the _equites illustres_ whom\r\nAugustus forbade to set foot in Egypt (Tac. _Ann._ ii. 59 “vetitis nisi\r\npermissu ingredi senatoribus aut equitibus Romanis illustribus”), but the\r\nknights chiefly referred to here are doubtless distinguished permanent\r\nmembers of the order.\r\n\r\n[1944] The variants used by Tacitus would apply to both of these classes.\r\nHe uses _insignis_ (_Ann._ xi. 5) and speaks of _primores equitum_\r\n(_Hist._ i. 4). Two ex-praefects of the praetorian guard are described as\r\n_equites Romani dignitate senatoria_ (_Ann._ xvi. 17).

Cf. Plin. _ad Traj._ 112 (113) “ii quos\r\nindulgentia tua quibusdam civitatibus super legitimum numerum adicere\r\npermisit.” Contrast with this the principle of admission to local senates\r\nrecognised by the _lex Julia Munic._ l. 85 “nei quis eorum quem ...\r\nlegito neve sublegito ... nisi in demortuei damnateive locum.”\r\n\r\n[2174] _Lex Julia Munic._ l. 135 “II vir(atum) IIII vir(atum) aliamve\r\nquam potestatem, ex quo honore in eum ordinem perveniat.”\r\n\r\n[2175] Paulus in _Dig._ 50, 2, 7, 2 “Is, qui non sit decurio, duumviratu\r\nvel aliis honoribus fungi non potest, quia decurionum honoribus plebeii\r\nfungi prohibentur.”\r\n\r\n[2176] _Dig._ 50, 2, 1.\r\n\r\n[2177] ib. 50, 4, 1, 3 “Illud tenendum est generaliter personale quidem\r\nmunus esse, quod corporibus labore cum sollicitudine animi ac vigilantia\r\nsollemniter extitit, patrimonii vero, in quo sumptus maxime postulatur.”\r\nBut the two ideas were often inseparable. Hence the recognition of _mixta\r\nmunera_ by Arcadius (50, 4, 18). For a complete enumeration of _munera_\r\nsee Kuhn _Verfassung_ i. pp. 35 ff.\r\n\r\n[2178] _Dig._ 50, 4, 1, 2; 50, 4, 18, 8, 16 and 26.\r\n\r\n[2179] ib. 50, 4, 1, 1.\r\n\r\n[2180] That coercion was sometimes employed is shown by Tacitus _Ann._\r\niv. 36 “objecta publice Cyzicenis incuria caerimoniarum divi Augusti,\r\nadditis violentiae criminibus adversum cives Romanos. Et amisere\r\nlibertatem.”\r\n\r\n[2181] Cf. Plin. _Paneg._ 80 “velocissimi sideris more omnia invisere,\r\nomnia audire, et undecumque invocatum statim, velut numen, adesse et\r\nadsistere.

In Cisalpine\r\nGaul we have _seviri et Augustales_, where the ex-sevir retains his\r\ntitle. In southern Italy _Augustalis_ is used for _sevir_.
