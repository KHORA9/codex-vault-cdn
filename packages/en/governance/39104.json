BENEDICT,\r\n  Stereo. and Print., 16 Spruce St.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Book aims to give a summary view of the most important general\r\nReforms, which have been effected or attempted in Great Britain and\r\nIreland, from the period of the French revolution down to the present\r\ntime. Neither history nor biography has been attempted, but the work\r\naspires to be only what its title indicates--_Sketches_. Large parts of\r\nit have recently appeared, from time to time, in the _National Era_, of\r\nWashington; no expectation being then entertained that it would assume\r\nany other form of publication. The present occasion has been embraced to\r\nrevise and reaerrange the whole, and by condensation and pruning off\r\nrepetitions, to make room for considerable additions to the list of\r\nsubjects discussed, and individuals noticed. It is even now incomplete,\r\nmany men and things, which deserve a place here, being left out--some\r\nbecause I may underrate their relative importance--others because the\r\nlimits of this work will allow only of selections. Still, it is believed\r\nthat no important subject has been wholly omitted; though, on account of\r\nthe vast number of those worthy to be called Reformers, it has been\r\nfound impossible to make special mention of many able and excellent\r\nindividuals. Though it may contain errors of fact and opinion, yet, as\r\nit is confined to those phases of events, and incidents in the lives of\r\npersons, which history too seldom dwells upon, it may be found not\r\nwholly valueless to those who would examine the most interesting and\r\ninstructive period in the recent annals of England.\r\n\r\nThe chronological plan of the work is, generally, to notice prominent\r\npopular movements in their order of time, and, in connection with each,\r\nto give sketches, more or less full, of persons who bore a leading part\r\nin it. But such slight regard has been paid to chronological\r\narrangement, that each subject stands by itself, having only a general\r\nconnection with what precedes or follows it.\r\n\r\nAs to my statistics, I have occasionally been compelled to reach\r\nconclusions much in the same manner as juries agree upon\r\nverdicts--consult a dozen authorities, each one differing with all the\r\nothers--get the sum total of the whole, divide it by twelve, and adopt\r\nthe result.\r\n\r\nThis Book is submitted to the reader as an humble attempt to make some\r\nof the Reformers of America better acquainted with some of the Reformers\r\nof the Old World--to show that the Anglo-Saxon love of liberty, which\r\ninspires so many hearts on both sides of the Atlantic, flows from the\r\nsame kindred fountain--to prove that, though when measured by her own\r\nvaunted standards, Great Britain is one of the most oppressive and\r\ndespicable Governments on earth, her radical reformers constitute as\r\nnoble a band of democratic philanthropists as the world has ever\r\nseen--to induce candid Americans to make just discriminations in their\r\nestimate of \"England and the English,\" and to draw distinctions between\r\nthe privileged orders of that country and a small, but increasing, and\r\neven now powerful body of its people, who admire the free institutions\r\nof the United States, and are laboring with heroic constancy, and a zeal\r\ntempered with discretion, to secure for themselves and their\r\nfellow-subjects the rights and privileges enjoyed by trans-Atlantic\r\nrepublicans,--and, finally, to record my admiration of those rare and\r\ntrue men, who, during the past half century, and while struggling\r\nagainst difficulties and enduring persecutions, of which we have but the\r\nfaintest conceptions, have achieved so much for the cause of Humanity\r\nand Freedom.\r\n\r\n                                                           H.

We have a common origin, and an identity of language;\r\nwe hold similar religious opinions, and draw the leading principles of\r\nour civil institutions from the same sources. Reading the same historic\r\npages, and while recounting the words and deeds of orators and statesmen\r\nwho have dignified human nature, or the achievements of warriors who\r\nhave filled the world with their fame, we say, \"these were _our_\r\nforefathers.\" The sages and scholars of both nations teach the youth to\r\ncherish the wisdom of Alfred, the deductions of Bacon, the discoveries\r\nof Newton, the philosophy of Locke, the drama of Shakspeare, and the\r\nsong of Milton, as the heir-looms of the whole Anglo-Saxon family. The\r\nties of blood and lineage are strengthened by those of monetary interest\r\nand reciprocal trade; while the channels of social intercourse are kept\r\nopen by the tides of emigration which flow unceasingly between us. And\r\nsuch are the resources of each in arts, in arms, in literature, in\r\ncommerce, in manufactures, in the productions of the soil, and such\r\ntheir advanced position in the science of government, and such the\r\nability and genius of their great men, that they must, for an indefinite\r\nperiod, exert a controlling influence on the destiny of mankind.\r\n\r\nNor when viewed in less attractive aspects, can America be indifferent\r\nto the condition and policy of her trans-Atlantic rival. She is\r\nenterprising, ambitious, intriguing. Whitening the ocean with the sails\r\nof her commerce, she sends her tradesmen wherever the marts of men teem\r\nwith traffic. Belting the earth with her colonies, dotting its surface\r\nwith her forts, anchoring her navies in all its harbors, she rules one\r\nhundred and sixty millions of men, giving law, not only to cultivated\r\nand refined States, but to dwarfed and hardy clans that shrivel and\r\nfreeze among the ices of the polar regions, and to swarthy and languid\r\nmyriads that repose in the orange groves or pant on the shrubless sands\r\nof the tropics. With retained spies in half the courts and cabinets of\r\nChristendom, she has for a century and a half caused or participated in\r\nnearly all the wars of Europe, Asia, and Africa, while by her arrogance,\r\ndiplomacy, or gold, she has shaped the policy of the combatants to the\r\npromotion of her own ends. Ancient Rome, whose name is the synonym of\r\nresistless power and boundless conquest, could not, in the palmy days of\r\nher Caesars, vie with Great Britain in the extent of her possessions and\r\nthe strength of her resources. Half a century ago, her great statesman,\r\nsketching the resources of her territory, said, \"The King of England, on\r\nwhose dominions the sun never sets.\" An American orator, of kindred\r\ngenius, unfolded the same idea in language which sparkles with the very\r\neffervescence of poetic beauty, when he spoke of her as \"that Power,\r\nwhose morning drum-beat, following the sun, and keeping company with the\r\nhours, encircles the earth daily with one continuous and unbroken strain\r\nof the martial airs of England.\" In a word, she embodies, in her history\r\nand policy, in large measure, all the virtues and vices of that\r\nalternate blessing and scourge of mankind, THE ANGLO-SAXON RACE.\r\n\r\nBritain, once a land of savage pagans, was, long after the Norman\r\nConquest, the abode of ignorance, superstition, and despotism. And\r\nthough for centuries past she has witnessed a steady advance in\r\nknowledge, and civil and religious liberty--though her men of letters\r\nhave sent down to their posterity works that shall live till science,\r\nphilosophy and poetry are known no more--though her lawyers have\r\ngradually worn off the rugged features of the feudal system, till the\r\ncommon law of England has been adopted as the basis of our republican\r\ncode--though her spiritual Bastile, the State Church, long since yielded\r\nto the attacks of non-conformity, and opened its gates to a qualified\r\ntoleration--though all that was vital and dangerous in the maxim, \"the\r\nKing can do no wrong,\" fell with the head of Charles I, in 1649--yet it\r\nis only within the last fifty years that she has discovered at work on\r\nher institutions a class of innovators, designated as \"REFORMERS.\"\r\n\r\nHumanity will find ample materials for despair, when contemplating the\r\ncondition of the depressed classes in Great Britain and Ireland. But\r\nphilanthropy will find abundant sources of hope in studying the\r\ncharacter and deeds of their radical reformers. The past half century\r\nhas seen an uprising, not of \"the middle class\" only, but of the very\r\nsubstratum of society, in a peaceful struggle for inherent rights. No\r\nforce has been employed, except the force of circumstances; and the\r\nresult has been eminently successful. This \"middle class\" (and the term\r\nhas great significance in England) discovered its strength during the\r\nrevolution under Hampden and Cromwell, and received an impulse then\r\nwhich it has never lost. The nobility and gentry have too often silenced\r\nthe popular clamor by admitting its leaders to the rank and privileges\r\nof \"the higher orders.\" Still, concessions were made to the mass of\r\nmiddle men, which stimulated them to demand, and strengthened them to\r\nobtain more. But a truth, destined to be all-potent in the nineteenth\r\ncentury, remained to be discovered, viz: the identity in interest of the\r\nmiddle and lower classes. The lines which custom and prejudice had drawn\r\nbetween them grew fainter and fainter as the day approached for the full\r\ndiscovery of this truth. The earthquake shock of the French Revolution\r\noverthrew a throne rooted to the soil by the growth of a thousand years.\r\nBritain felt the crash. Scales fell from all eyes, and the people of the\r\nrealm discovered that subjects were clothed with Divine rights as well\r\nas kings. Englishmen said so, in public addresses and resolutions, not\r\nalways expressed in courtly phrase, nor rounded off in the style of\r\nrhetorical adulation so grateful to regal ears. The king, not having\r\nduly profited by the lesson the American rebels had taught him, indicted\r\nHardy, Thelwall, Tooke, and their compatriots, for sedition and treason.\r\nThese men were the representatives of both the middle and lower classes.\r\nTheir constituents--THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND--combined for their mutual\r\nsafety against the common oppressor. The wall of partition was partially\r\nbroken down, and, from that hour to this, the struggle between Right and\r\nPrivilege, between the Subject and the Crown, has gone on, distinguished\r\nby alternate defeat and victory, by heroic constancy and dastardly\r\ntreachery--noble martyrs dying, valiant combatants living to continue\r\nthe good fight.\r\n\r\n_\"The Condition of England\" question_ (as the Parliamentary phrase runs)\r\nwas, a century ago, a matter of indifference to the masses. Lord\r\nCastlereagh but uttered the adage of a hundred years when he said, \"the\r\npeople have nothing to do with the laws, except to obey them.\"\r\nParliament was opened with a dull King's speech, to be followed by the\r\nopening of the annual budget of the Chancellor of the Exchequer,\r\nproposing to raise a loan for foreign wars, or a fund to sink the\r\ninterest of the public debt. An oracular response was given by the\r\nMinister now and then to some query touching the relations of the\r\nkingdom to continental Powers, or the resources of some newly-acquired\r\ncolony. An occasional bill was introduced to pamper the landlord\r\naristocracy, or to increase the resources of the clergy, and enforce the\r\ncollection of tithes in the manufacturing districts. Untitled manhood\r\nwas held \"dog cheap;\" and all legislation (excepting the throwing of a\r\nbone now and then to the Cerberus of \"vulgar clamor\") looked to the\r\nconservation of the privileged classes, the dignity of the nobility, the\r\nwealth of the church, and the prerogatives of the Crown. How different\r\nnow! The representatives of THE PEOPLE have broken into the sacred\r\ninclosure of \"the Government,\" and new men, with new opinions, have\r\nusurped the places of an ancient aristocracy, and its antiquated\r\nprinciples. Now, \"the Condition of England\" question takes cognizance of\r\nthe rights and the wrongs of all, and involves searching examinations,\r\nand hot and irreverent discussions, in and out of Parliament, of poor\r\nlaws, pension laws, game laws, corn laws, free trade, universal\r\neducation, unrestricted religious toleration, standing armies, floating\r\nnavies, Irish repeal, East and West India emancipation, colonial\r\nindependence, complete suffrage, the ballot, annual Parliaments, law\r\nreform, land reform, entails, primogeniture, the life-tenure of judges,\r\nan hereditary peerage, the House of Lords, the Bench of Bishops, the\r\nMonarchy itself, with other matters of like import, about which the\r\ntrader and the farmer of Queen Anne's time knew but little, and never\r\ndared to question above his breath, but which, in the days of Victoria,\r\nare the common talk of the artisan and yeoman. Ay, more than this:\r\nreforms not dreamed of in 1805, by Fox, the liberal, are proposed and\r\ncarried in 1845 by Peel, the conservative. \"Oh, for the golden days of\r\ngood Queen Bess,\" when the common people paid their tithes and ate what\r\nbread they could get, and left law-making to the Knights of the Shire\r\nand the Peers of the Realm!\r\n\r\nBut he must superficially read history who supposes that the fruitful\r\nReforms, which now strike their roots so deep into British soil, and\r\nthrow their branches so high and wide over the land, were planted by\r\nthis century. Their seeds were sown long since, and watered with the\r\ntears and fertilized by the blood of men as pure and brave as God ever\r\nsent to bless and elevate our race. From the conquest of William the\r\nNorman, down to the coronation of Victoria the Saxon, one fact stands\r\nprominently on the page of English history, viz: that there has been a\r\ngradual circumscribing of the powers of the nobles and the prerogatives\r\nof the Crown, accompanied with a corresponding enlargement of the\r\nliberties of the people. Omitting many, I will glance at some of the\r\nmore conspicuous landmarks in this highway of reform.\r\n\r\nThe mitigation of the rigors of the feudal system by William Rufus, the\r\nson of the Conqueror, who established it.--The general institution of\r\ntrial by jury, in the succeeding reign of Henry II, and the granting of\r\nfreedom to the towns of the realm by royal charters.--Old King John, at\r\nRunnymede, affixing his sign manual to MAGNA CHARTA, with trembling\r\nhand, at the dictation of his haughty barons and their retainers. The\r\nestablishment of the House of Commons, about the middle of the\r\nthirteenth century, thus giving the commercial men of the middle class a\r\nvoice in the Government.--Edward I, \"the English Justinian,\" encouraging\r\nthe courts in those decisions which tended to restrain the feudal lords\r\nand protect their vassals; and approving a statute which declared that\r\nno tax or impost should be laid without the consent of the Lords and\r\nCommons.--The introduction into England, in the latter part of the\r\nfifteenth century, of the art of printing, and the consequent cheapness\r\nof the price of books, and the diffusion of that knowledge which is\r\npower.--The discovery of America, giving an impulse to British commerce,\r\nand increasing the importance of the trading classes, by placing in\r\ntheir hands those sinews of war which kings must have, or cease to make\r\nconquests. The Reformation, introduced into England in 1534, unfettering\r\nthe conscience, and giving to the laity the Heaven-descended charter of\r\nhuman rights--the Bible.--The Petition of Right--the British Declaration\r\nof Independence--signed by Charles I, in 1628, by command of his\r\nParliament, which materially curbed the royal prerogative.--His headless\r\ntrunk on the scaffold at Whitehall, in 1649, when the aspiring blood of\r\na Stuart sank into the ground, to appease the republican wrath of\r\nDeacon Praise-God Barebones and Captain Smite-them-hip-and-thigh Clapp,\r\nand their brother Roundheads--teaching anointed tyrants that, though\r\nkings can do no wrong, they can die like common felons.--The succeeding\r\nCommonwealth, when a Huntingdonshire farmer swayed with more than regal\r\nmajesty the scepter which had so often dropped from the feebler hands of\r\nthe Plantagenets and Tudors. The passage of the _Habeas Corpus_ act, in\r\n1678, in the reign of Charles II, who saved his head by surrendering his\r\nveto. The Revolution of 1688, which deposed one line of kings and chose\r\nanother, prescribing to the elected monarch his coronation oath, and\r\nexacting his ratification of the new Declaration of Rights.--The\r\nAmerican Revolution, with its Declaration of Independence, teaching the\r\nHouse of Hanover the salutary truth, not only that \"resistance to\r\ntyrants is obedience to God,\" but it can be successful. These, and\r\ncognate epochs in English history, which preceded those Modern Reforms\r\nof which I am more particularly to speak, are links in that long chain\r\nof events which gradually circumscribed the power of the princes and\r\nnobles. Each was a concession to that old Anglo-Saxon spirit of liberty,\r\nwhich demanded independence for the American Colonies, and is now\r\nworking out the freedom of the subjects of the Queen of Great Britain\r\nand Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe object of the following chapters will be, to briefly sketch some of\r\nthese MODERN REFORMS, interspersed with notices of some of the prominent\r\nactors in each.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n     British Cabinets from 1770 to 1830--Summary of the Efforts of the\r\n     Reformers, from the War of 1793 to the Formation of the Grey\r\n     Ministry in 1830.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore specially considering any one prominent Reform in English\r\nhistory, a general summary of events may be profitable. It will be _but_\r\na summary, preliminary to a more general discussion, and will be mainly\r\nconfined to the period between the French Revolution and the formation\r\nof the Grey Ministry in 1830.\r\n\r\nFrom 1770 to 1830, the Government of Great Britain was, with the\r\nexception of a few months, swayed by the enemies of Reform. In the\r\nformer year, Lord North, a name odious to Americans, who had previously\r\nled the Tories in the House of Commons, assumed the premiership. He\r\nretained his place, his principles, and his power, twelve years. In\r\n1782, a _quasi_ liberal ministry supplanted him, headed by Rockingham,\r\nFox, and Burke, which was dissolved in three months, by the death of the\r\nformer, when Fox, Burke, and their friends, refused to unite under\r\nShelburne, the succeeding Tory Premier, who sought new supporters,\r\ngiving young Pitt the seals of the Exchequer and the lead in the\r\nCommons. Stung by mortification at their exclusion from office, Fox and\r\nBurke united with North in forming the famous \"Coalition,\" and in April,\r\n1783, prostrated Shelburne. Thereupon, a new ministry was made up of\r\nthose disaffected Whig and Tory chiefs, Fox, Burke, the Duke of Portland\r\nand Lord North being its leading spirits. This Coalition, which for\r\nyears damaged the fame of Fox, struggled for its unnatural existence\r\ntill the following December, when, failing to carry Mr. Fox's India\r\nbill, it expired, dishonored and unregretted. Pitt, \"the pilot that\r\nweathered the storm,\" then took the helm of State, which he held\r\neighteen tempestuous years, and was succeeded, not supplanted, in 1801,\r\nby the weak but amiable Mr. Addington. Lord Hawkesbury (the subsequent\r\nLord Liverpool) took the pen of Foreign Secretary; Eldon (Sir John\r\nScott) clutched the great seal of Chancery; and Perceval put on the gown\r\nof Solicitor General. This ministry leaned on Pitt for support, and was\r\nhis puppet, having taken office to do what he was too proud to\r\nperform--make peace with France. The war demon smoothed his wrinkled\r\nfront only for a short period, when his visage suddenly became grim, and\r\nthe ship of State was, in 1803, again plunged in the waves of a European\r\ncontest. The helm soon slipped from the feeble hands of Addington, and\r\n\"the pilot\" was recalled to his old station, where he remained till\r\n1806, when his lofty spirit sinking under the shock of the overthrow at\r\nAusterlitz of the Continental Coalition against Napoleon, of which he\r\nwas the animating soul, he hid his mortified heart in a premature grave.\r\n\r\nA liberal ministry, clustering around Lord Grenville and Mr. Fox, took\r\nup the reins of power which had dropped from the relaxed hands of Pitt,\r\nabolished the slave trade, attempted to ameliorate the condition of the\r\nCatholics, encountered the bigotry of George III, failed, resigned, and\r\nwere succeeded by an ultra Tory administration, of which Perceval,\r\nLiverpool, Eldon, Castlereagh, and Canning were the chief members. For\r\nsix years they followed in the footsteps of Pitt, fighting Napoleon\r\nabroad and Reformers at home, propping up the thrones of continental\r\ndespots, and fortifying the prerogatives of the English crown, till, in\r\n1812, Perceval, who was then Premier, fell before the pistol of a madman\r\nin the lobby of the House of Commons. Simultaneously with putting the\r\ncrazy assassin to death, almost without the forms of a trial,\r\nLiverpool, as Premier, and Castlereagh, as Foreign Secretary, came into\r\npower, and, pursuing the policy of Pitt and Perceval, the same ministry,\r\nwith occasional modifications, retained its place until the death of\r\nLiverpool, in 1827. Castlereagh, its life and soul, and the evil genius\r\nof England, and the truckling tool of the Holy Alliance, perished by his\r\nown hand in 1823, and was succeeded in the Foreign Department by\r\nCanning, who infused a more liberal spirit into the Cabinet, especially\r\nin the attitude of England towards the Alliance.\r\n\r\nSuch had been the advance of free principles amongst the body of the\r\npeople during the fifteen years of Liverpool's administration, that\r\nGeorge IV had great difficulty in forming a new ministry. Wellington and\r\nPeel refused to become members if the friends of Catholic Emancipation\r\nwere admitted, and Canning refused to join if they were excluded. After\r\na long train of negotiations, the anger of the King exploded at the\r\nstubbornness of the Iron Duke, and he gave Canning his royal hand to\r\nkiss, with a _carte blanche_ for the enrolment of a ministry. He formed\r\na mixed Government, whose average quality was mollified Toryism. He\r\nbrought into the compound Robinson and Huskisson, his recent associates\r\nin the Liverpool cabinet, whose liberal course on trade and finance,\r\nduring the last four years, foreshadowed the repeal of the corn laws and\r\nthe dawning of better days. Wellington and Peel spurned the\r\namalgamation, whilst Eldon, with the shedding of many tears and the\r\ntearing of much hair, surrendered the great seal, which his strong hand\r\nhad grasped for twenty-six years, to the great detriment of suitors with\r\nshort purses, and the great profit of barristers with long wind. The\r\ncountry expected much from the new administration. But whether well or\r\nill founded, its anticipations were extinguished in a few brief months\r\nby the death of the brilliant genius who had inspired its hopes. When\r\nthe grave closed over Canning, Lord Gooderich (Mr. Robinson) organized\r\na piebald ministry, of such incongruous materials that it broke in\r\npieces almost in the very act of being set up. Wellington was then\r\nsummoned to the King's closet, and in January, 1828, became Premier,\r\ngiving the lead of the Commons to his favorite, Peel, he himself\r\nundertaking to control the House of Peers, much according to the tactics\r\nof the field of Waterloo. The Iron Duke, who was always adroit at a\r\nretreat, and the supple commoner, both of whom had refused to join\r\nCanning because he favored Catholic amelioration, now reluctantly\r\ngranted, because they dared not withhold, the repeal of the Corporation\r\nand Test Acts, and the emancipation of the Catholics! The\r\nWellington-Peel Government struggled bravely till late in 1830, when the\r\ntide of Parliamentary Reform, rising to a resistless hight, overwhelmed\r\nthem, and the first liberal ministry (excepting a few distracted months)\r\nwhich England had witnessed for sixty-five years, was organized by Earl\r\nGrey. Fortunate man! He now saw the seeds of that reform, which, forty\r\nyears before, in the fervor of youth, he sowed in Parliament, and had\r\nsteadily cultivated under contumely and reproach from that day till\r\nthis, about to yield an abundance which his matured and ennobled hand\r\nwas to garner in, whilst the people \"shouted the Harvest Home.\"\r\n\r\nBegging the reader's pardon for introducing this dry detail of names and\r\ndates, it may be further noted, that in glancing over the dreary wastes\r\nwhich stretch between the elevation of North and the downfall of\r\nWellington, but few verdant spots rise to relieve the reformer's eye.\r\nFrom the commencement of the French war, in 1793, till the repeal of the\r\nCorporation and Test Acts, in 1828, not a solitary important reform was\r\ncarried, except the abolition of the slave trade, and the British empire\r\nexhibited a broad sea of rank Conservatism. But, though nothing was\r\n_perfected_ in these thirty-five years, no period of British history\r\nteems with events more gratifying to a hopeful and progressive humanity.\r\nFoul and fetid as were the waters of the Dead Sea, they were constantly\r\nlashed by a healthful and purifying agitation. These fruitless years\r\nwere the seed-time of a harvest to be reaped in better days; and all the\r\nreforms which from 1828 till now have blessed and are blessing England\r\nwere never forgotten, but continually pressed upon the attention of\r\nParliament and the country, by a resolute band of men illustrious for\r\ntheir talents and their services. In proof of this, a few rude\r\nlandmarks, before entering upon a more minute survey of this period, may\r\nbe worth the erecting.\r\n\r\nThe trials, at the Old Bailey, in 1794, of Tooke, Hardy, and their\r\nassociates, prosecuted for high treason for their words and acts as\r\nmembers of a Society for Parliamentary Reform, were the first outbreak\r\nof the wide-spread alarm at the prevalence of the political opinions\r\nintroduced into the kingdom by the French Revolution. The Government was\r\nfoiled; the prisoners were acquitted; Erskine, their advocate, won\r\nunfading laurels; and the doctrine of \"constructive treason\" was forever\r\nexploded in England.\r\n\r\nThe foreign policy of Pitt and his successors, which sent England on a\r\ntwenty-five years' crusade to fight the battles of Absolutism on the\r\ncontinent, encountered the fiery logic of Fox, the dazzling declamation\r\nof Sheridan, the analytical reasoning of Tierney, the dignified rebukes\r\nof Grey, the sturdy sense of Whitbread, the scholastic arguments of\r\nHorner, and the bold assaults of Burdett. And at a later period, when\r\nCastlereagh humbled the power of England at the footstool of the Holy\r\nAlliance, Brougham made the land echo with appeals to the Anglo-Saxon\r\nlove of liberty, till Canning, in 1823, protested against the acts of\r\nthe Allied Sovereigns, and in the following year declared in the House\r\nof Commons, while the old chamber rung with plaudits, that ministers had\r\nrefused to become a party to a new Congress of the Allies.\r\n\r\nIn 1806-7, the slave trade fell under the united attacks of Wilberforce,\r\nFox, and Pitt; Clarkson, Sharpe, and other worthies, supplying the\r\nammunition for the assault. And the West India slave, long forgotten,\r\nwas remembered when Canning, in 1823, introduced resolutions that\r\nimmediate measures ought to be adopted by the planters to secure such a\r\ngradual improvement in the slave's condition as might render safe his\r\nultimate admission to participation in the civil rights and privileges\r\nof other classes of His Majesty's subjects; and addressed a\r\ncorresponding ministerial circular to the colonies.\r\n\r\nIn 1809, Romilly brought his eminent legal knowledge and graceful\r\neloquence to bear against the sanguinary criminal code which a dark age\r\nhad obtruded on the noonday of civilization. He subsequently exposed the\r\nabuses of the Court of Chancery, which, under the tardy administration\r\nof \"that everlasting doubter,\" Lord Eldon, pressed heavily on the\r\ncountry. He laid bare the absurd technicalities and verbosities which\r\nblocked the avenues to the common law courts. Having removed some of\r\nthis rubbish, and softened a few of the asperities of the criminal code,\r\nhis benevolent heart sunk in the grave, when the philosophic and\r\nclassical Mackintosh resumed the work, and carrying a radical motion for\r\ninquiry over the heads of ministers in 1819, pressed it nearer that\r\ntolerable consummation which Brougham, Williams, and Denman reached at a\r\nlater day. The cause of law reform was powerfully aided by the closet\r\nlabors of that singular person, Jeremy Bentham, whose world-wide\r\nresearches and world-filling books, written in a style as consecutive\r\nand tedious as the story of The House that Jack Built, discussed\r\neverything pertaining to government, from the constitution of a kingdom\r\nto the construction of a work-house.\r\n\r\nThe condition of Ireland and the relief of the Catholics occupied much\r\nof the public attention during the period under review. The rebellion of\r\n1798 turned all eyes towards that devoted island. The next year, Pitt\r\nproposed the Legislative Union. It encountered the fierce epigrams of\r\nSheridan; and though it passed both Houses, it met with such vehement\r\nopposition from the Irish Parliament, that it was abandoned till the\r\nnext year, when Pitt renewed the proposal. Grattan, the very soul of\r\nIrish chivalry, rained down upon it a shower of invective from the West\r\nside of the channel, and was seconded by the glittering oratory of\r\nSheridan and the calmer reasoning of Grey and Lord Holland on the East.\r\nBut Britain extended to Ireland the right hand of a Judas fellowship,\r\nwhilst with the left she bribed her to accept the proffered alliance. In\r\n1807, Lord Grenville, who was ever a firm friend of religious liberty\r\nand of Ireland, and Grey, in behalf of the Cabinet, proposed an\r\namelioration of the bigoted code which made the worship of God by the\r\nCatholic a crime. They failed, and ministers resigned. The question of\r\nCatholic relief was pressed to a division, in various forms, fourteen\r\ntimes, without success, from 1805 to 1819. In the latter year, Grattan\r\nmoved that the House take into consideration the matter of Catholic\r\nEmancipation, and failed by only two majority. In 1821, Plunkett,\r\ndistinguished for his attainments and virtues, and a model of eloquence,\r\nwhether standing at the Irish bar or in the British Senate, carried the\r\nmotion which Grattan lost, Peel strenuously resisting, by a majority of\r\nsix. He followed up his victory by pushing the Consolidation Bill (a\r\nmeasure of amelioration only) through the Commons; but it was thrown out\r\nby the Lords. Sparing further details for the present, suffice it to\r\nsay, that at intervals during this period, Sydney Smith, with his Peter\r\nPlymley Letters, laughed to scorn the fears of high churchmen; a host of\r\npamphleteers of all sizes sifted the question to its very chaff, and\r\nO'Connell and his \"Associations\" and \"Unions,\" in spite of the\r\nsuspension of the _habeas corpus_ and the enactment of coercion bills,\r\nagitated from the Giant's Causeway to Cape Clear, and ultimately wrung\r\nfrom the fears of the oppressor what his sense of justice would not\r\ngive.\r\n\r\nThe Protestant dissenters, with a less rude hand, knocked at the doors\r\nof Parliament, demanding the purification of the Established Church, and\r\nthe opening of its gates to Toleration. The rich clergy were compelled\r\nby law to pay higher salaries to their poor curates--Hume's clumsy\r\nabuse fell on the heads of the lazy prelates who made godliness\r\ngain--and the \"pickings and stealings,\" which the Establishment\r\ntolerated in a long train of sanctimonious supernumeraries, were exposed\r\nto the gaze of the uninitiated when Brougham carried his bill against\r\nministers, in 1819, for a board of commissioners to investigate the\r\nabuses of public charities. The Corporation and Test Acts, which\r\nenslaved the consciences of dissenters, were denounced by Fox and\r\nBurdett, preparatory to their ultimate repeal (of which more anon) by\r\nLord John Russell's bill in 1828.\r\n\r\nNor was the importance of educating the masses forgotten. Not content\r\nwith aiding Romilly, Smith, Horner, Mackintosh, and Jeffrey, in\r\ninstructing the higher circles by frequent contributions to the\r\nEdinburgh Review on domestic and European politics, Brougham wrote\r\nrudimental tracts for the lower orders--lectured to Mechanics'\r\nInstitutes--contributed to Penny Magazines--and in 1820, after a speech\r\nwhich exhibited perfect familiarity with the educational condition of\r\nthe unlettered masses, launched in Parliament his comprehensive scheme\r\nfor the instruction of the poor in England and Wales; thus proving that\r\n_he_ was entitled to the eulogy he bestowed on another, as \"the patron\r\nof all the arts that humanize and elevate mankind.\"\r\n\r\nHaving seen this favorite scheme fairly afloat, this wonderful man\r\nturned to far different employments. The misguided but injured Queen\r\nCaroline landed in England in 1820, amidst the shoutings of the\r\npopulace. Ministers immediately brought in their bill of pains and\r\npenalties; _i. e._, a bill to degrade and divorce the Queen, without\r\ngiving her the benefit of those ordinary forms of law which protect even\r\nthe confessed adulteress. She appointed Brougham her Attorney General.\r\nIn the midst of such a popular ferment as England has rarely seen, he\r\npromptly seized the royal libertine in his harem, and while giving one\r\nhand to the regulation of his new educational machine, with the other\r\ndragged him into the open field of shame, and concentrated upon him the\r\nscorn of Virtue and Humanity.\r\n\r\nThe corn laws were the subject of frequent debates and divisions.\r\nWaiving till another occasion their more particular consideration, it\r\nmay here be stated, that the frequent recurrence of extreme agricultural\r\nand commercial distress always brought with it into Parliament the\r\nsubject of the corn trade, provoking a discussion of the antagonistic\r\ntheories of protection and free trade, and challenging to the arena the\r\nlearning and experience of Burdett, Horner, Ricardo, Baring, Hume,\r\nHuskisson, and Brougham. It was on these occasions that the latter used\r\nto exhibit that close familiarity with the statistics of political\r\neconomy and of domestic and foreign trade, and of the laws of demand and\r\nsupply, which surprised even those acquainted with his exhaustless\r\nversatility. His only match in this department was Huskisson, to whose\r\nenlightened and steady advocacy of unrestricted commerce its friends are\r\ngreatly indebted. As early as 1823, this generally conservative\r\ngentleman moved a set of resolutions providing for an annual and rapid\r\nreduction of the duties on foreign corn, till the point of free trade\r\nwas attained.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to this subject was that of budgets, sinking funds,\r\nloans, civil lists, and army and navy expenditures, all summed up in the\r\nword _taxes_. The means of paying the interest on the L600,000,000 debt\r\nPitt had run up in reenthroning the pauper Bourbons (not to speak of the\r\n240 000,000 pounds before existing) was to be provided for. The current,\r\nexpenses of the Government clamored for large sums. Under this annual\r\nload of taxation, a nation of Astors might have staggered. The liberal\r\nparty plead for economy and retrenchment in the army and the navy, in\r\nthe church and the state. Brougham, Ricardo, and other smaller\r\ncipherers, applied the pruning knife to the prolific tree of taxation\r\nand expenditure. But the chief annoyance of Ministers was Mr. Hume.\r\nAfter he entered Parliament, all schemes for raising or appropriating\r\nmoney encountered his scrutinizing eye and merciless _figurings_. With\r\nno more eloquence than the multiplication table, he as rarely made\r\nmistakes in his calculations. And whenever Mr. Vansittart, the\r\nfoggy-headed Chancellor of the Exchequer, appeared on the floor with his\r\nmoney bills, his tormentor was sure to pin him to the wall by his\r\nskillful use of the nine digits, which he followed up by crushing that\r\nunfortunate gentleman between huge columns of statistics.\r\n\r\nParliamentary Reform, the enginery by which the people of England must\r\nwork out a bloodless revolution, was repeatedly agitated, and with\r\nvarious results. Stormy debates, followed by divisions and defeats, did\r\nnot discourage Grey, Mackintosh, Brougham, Lambton, and Russell, within\r\ndoors, nor Tooke, Cartwright, Cobbett, Hunt, and a host of other good,\r\nbad, and indifferent men without, from seeking enlarged suffrage and\r\nequal representation. Nor did laws enacted to stop the circulation\r\namongst the working classes of cheap publications, by laying a tax on\r\nthem; and to put down reformatory societies, under the pretext of\r\nprohibiting seditious meetings; and to seize arms found in the hands of\r\nthe lower orders, so that their assemblies might be dispersed at the\r\nbayonet's point without fear of retaliation; nor the occasional\r\nsearching of a library and demolishing a press, and sending a writer or\r\nlecturer to Botany Bay, deter the masses from demanding that \"the\r\nPeople's _House_ should be open to the People's _Representatives_.\"\r\nPassing by many noteworthy occurrences, we find Birmingham, in 1819,\r\nwithout a representative for its teeming thousands, while rotten\r\nGrampound, with scarce an inhabitant, had two, adopting the bold measure\r\nof electing \"a Legislatorial Attorney\" to represent it in the House of\r\nCommons! The next year, a large and peaceable meeting of reformers at\r\nManchester is dispersed by cavalry, with loss of much precious blood.\r\nThe common people throughout the kingdom are deeply moved at this\r\nspectacle--riots follow--troops shed more blood--Ministers denounce the\r\nagitators--Burdett defends them--Brougham defies Ministers, and Lord\r\nJohn Russell numbers the days of Grampound. The next session he moves to\r\ndisfranchise that rotten borough, which had been convicted of bribery,\r\nand transfer its members to Leeds. He fails. The next session, Lambton\r\n(Earl Durham) brings in a bill for a radical reform, and is defeated by\r\na scurvy trick of Ministers. Lord John renews the conflict with another\r\nbill--the People's petitions press the tables of the House--Ministers\r\nbegin to give way--Grampound is disfranchised, and its members\r\ntransferred to York county, and the first nail is driven! In 1823, Lord\r\nJohn leads on the attack by explaining a well-digested scheme of reform\r\nin a luminous speech. Canning makes a conciliatory reply, and, in his\r\nbrilliant peroration, tells Russell he will yet succeed, but on his head\r\nbe the responsibility. Russell is beaten, but the minority is swelled by\r\nthe accession for the first time of several young members of the ancient\r\nnobility. The same year, Castlereagh cuts his throat, and falls into a\r\ngrave which Englishmen will execrate till the crack of doom. The\r\n\"radicals\" (a name which the reformers received when Birmingham elected\r\nher attorney) take courage--Lord John beats ministers on an incidental\r\nquestion--Old Sarum trembles for her ancient privileges--the French\r\nmonarchy is temporarily overthrown, and Earl Grey rises to power.\r\n\r\nIn this summary, which sets chronological order and historical symmetry\r\nat defiance, I have only aimed to show that, from 1793 to 1830, the\r\nfires on Freedom's Altar were kept burning by a band of worshipers, many\r\nof whose names find few parallels in English history, whether we\r\nconsider the vigor of their understandings, the extent of their\r\nknowledge, the splendor of their genius, the luster of their services,\r\nand the fidelity and courage with which they followed the fortunes of\r\nthe liberal cause through thirty-seven years of opposition to Court\r\nfavor and Ministerial patronage.\r\n\r\nA more particular notice of these events and persons will be pursued in\r\nfuture chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n     Treason Trials of 1794--Societies for Reform--Constructive\r\n     Treason--Horne Tooke--Mr. Erskine.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first conflict between Englishmen and their rulers, to which I will\r\nnow more particularly refer, is the sedition and treason trials, near\r\nthe close of the last century; more especially alluding to the trials of\r\nJOHN HORNE TOOKE, HARDY, THELWALL, and their associates, in 1794, for\r\nhigh treason. The victories then achieved heralded those subsequent\r\nreforms in Church and State which have so blessed the common people of\r\nEngland. It was the crisis of British freedom. Though failure then would\r\nnot have uprooted the goodly tree, it would have blasted much of its\r\nsweet fruit, and retarded its luxuriant growth. Maj. Cartwright, (\"that\r\nold heart of sedition,\" as Canning called him,) one of England's early\r\nreformers, in a letter written at the time, said: \"Had these trials\r\nended otherwise than they have, the system of proscription and terror,\r\nwhich has for some time been growing in this country, would have been\r\ncompleted and written in blood.\" The verdicts of \"not guilty\" not only\r\npronounced the acquittal of the prisoners, but proclaimed the right of\r\nindividuals and associations to examine and reprobate the acts of their\r\nKing and Parliament; to discuss the foundations of government, and\r\ndeclare the rights of man and the wrongs of princes; and to arouse\r\npublic opinion to demand such changes in the laws as would secure the\r\nliberties of the people. The crime charged against Tooke and his\r\nassociates was, endeavoring to excite a rebellion, overthrow the\r\nmonarchy, wage war on the king, and compass his death. Their real\r\noffense was, belonging to \"the London Corresponding Society\" and \"the\r\nSociety for Constitutional Information,\" better known as societies for\r\nParliamentary reform, in which they canvassed the nature of government,\r\nthe rights of the people, and the acts of their rulers, and specially\r\nadvocated a reform in the Parliamentary representation and the electoral\r\nsuffrage.\r\n\r\nThis was no new movement. Similar associations had existed for twenty\r\nyears. The Society of \"the Friends of the People\" numbered among its\r\nmembers the imposing names of the Duke of Richmond, Pitt, Sheridan,\r\nWhitbread, Grey, and other men of rank. They had held meetings,\r\npublished pamphlets, and petitioned Parliament. Discussions had taken\r\nplace in both Houses. In 1770, the great Chatham advocated a moderate\r\nreform in the representation in the lower House. In 1776, Wilkes, the\r\nfavorite of the London populace, made an able speech on moving for leave\r\nto bring in a radical bill to the same end. In 1783, Pitt, yielding to\r\nthe generous impulses of his youth, moved for a committee to inquire\r\ninto the same subject, and supported his motion in two eloquent\r\nspeeches. In 1790, Flood, the celebrated Irishman, spoke with fervor on\r\nmoving for a more equal representation in the Commons, and was replied\r\nto by Wyndham and Pitt, (who had become frightened by the French\r\nrevolution,) and powerfully supported by Fox, then in the zenith of his\r\nfame, and by Grey, just giving earnest of those talents which, forty\r\nyears after, carried the reform bill through the Lords. The discussion\r\nof kindred topics in Parliament during the same periods stimulated the\r\npopular party. The expulsion of Wilkes, the idol of the London mob, from\r\nthe Commons; the seizure of his papers and the imprisonment of his\r\nperson in the Tower for a seditious libel against the Tory Government;\r\nhis repeated reelection by his Middlesex constituency, and the votes of\r\nthe House declaring his seat still vacant; the consequent debates in\r\nboth Houses during the years 1768-'70 excited the populace to the verge\r\nof rebellion, and challenged inquiry into the relative rights of the\r\npeople and their Parliament. The debates on the stamp act, the taxation\r\nof the colonies, and the American war, covering fifteen years, enlisted\r\nthe best powers of Chatham, Burke, Fox, and Barre, and elicited from\r\nthose high sources radical declarations of the rights of man. The\r\ndenunciations of the test acts and of the Catholic penal code by Fox and\r\nhis followers, from 1786 to 1790, as subversive of the rights of\r\nconscience, added fuel to the popular flame. All these agitations within\r\nthe walls of Parliament were but the remoter pulsations of the great\r\nheart beating without--the faint shadows of that genius of reform,\r\nwhich, till recently, has numbered its representatives by units and its\r\nconstituency by hundreds of thousands.\r\n\r\nThe political sea, ruffled by these winds, was soon to be tossed by\r\nviolent storms. The French revolution produced a profound sensation in\r\nall classes of Englishmen. The fulminations of its _third estate_\r\nagainst monarchy, and the democratic doctrines of Paine's Rights of Man,\r\n(republished in England from the Parisian edition, and scattered far and\r\nwide,) found a response in thousands of British hearts. The people felt\r\ntheir grievances to be more intolerable than ever, and the example of\r\nFrance emboldened them to demand redress in firmer tones. The London\r\nSociety for Constitutional Information, which had grown languid,\r\nsuddenly felt a revival of more than its original spirit, and kindred\r\nassociations sprang into existence all over the kingdom. Their orators\r\ndeclaimed upon the rights of man, painted his wrongs, extolled the\r\nmerits of the people, and denounced the vices of bishops and nobles. The\r\noppressions of the middle and lower classes, (of both which the\r\nsocieties were mainly composed,) by the privileged orders, afforded\r\nample materials for these appeals to the best and worst passions of\r\nhuman nature.\r\n\r\nThe Government was alarmed. The events of France in 1792 had determined\r\nthe English Ministry to crush in the bud the revolution they pretended\r\nthey saw springing up at home. Their real object was to prostrate the\r\nreformatory associations. Louis was deposed, and the Republic had\r\ndecreed fraternity and aid to the people of all nations in recovering\r\ntheir liberties. Riots occurred in a few English manufacturing towns.\r\nThe King suddenly convened Parliament, and declared in his speech, that\r\nconspiracies existed for overthrowing the Government, and that the\r\nkingdom was on the eve of a revolution. In the debate on the King's\r\nspeech, the Minister said that seditious societies had been instituted,\r\nunder the plausible pretext of discussing constitutional questions, but\r\nreally to promote an insurrection of the people. Mr. Fox met the\r\nassertions of King and Minister with a denial, whose language borders on\r\ntemerity. He declared, \"there was not one fact stated in His Majesty's\r\nspeech which was not false--not one assertion or insinuation which was\r\nnot unfounded. The prominent feature in it was, that it was an\r\nintolerable calumny on the people of Great Britain; an insinuation of so\r\ngross and black a nature that it demanded the most rigorous inquiry and\r\nthe most severe punishment!\" Bold words, these; not unlike those of\r\nCromwell, who declared \"he would as soon put his sword through the heart\r\nof the King as that of any other man.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Government was not to be arrested in its course by the bold\r\nwords of the Opposition leader. It continued to prosecute printers and\r\nlecturers for seditious libels and speeches, fining, imprisoning,\r\ncropping, branding, and transporting, at will. The progress of events in\r\nFrance was precipitating the crisis. In 1793, Louis and his Queen were\r\nguillotined, and the next year saw the Princess Elizabeth's head fall,\r\nwhile the bloody star of Robespierre loomed in the ascendant. At these\r\nscenes, the cheek of monarchical Europe turned pale. Pitt was alarmed.\r\nProsecutions for sedition did not reach the seat of the disease. Royal\r\nproclamations did not silence the reformers. The constitutional\r\nsocieties still met and debated. Early in the session of 1794, he\r\nbrought in bills to clothe the Government with extraordinary powers to\r\ndetect suspicious persons, (_i. e._ reformers,) and to suspend the\r\n_habeas corpus_ act. After a furious contest, in which Fox, Grey, and\r\nSheridan, stood by the popular cause, the bills passed. The _habeas\r\ncorpus_ was suspended in May, 1794. The safeguard of English liberty\r\nbeing prostrated, a fell blow was aimed at the societies, through the\r\npersons of some of their leading members. Informations for high treason\r\nwere filed in May by the Attorney General (Sir John Scott--Lord Eldon)\r\nagainst Tooke, Hardy, Thelwall, and nine others, and they were sent to\r\nthe Tower to await their trials. Both parties now prepared for a\r\ndeath-struggle. The Ministers trusted for success to the power of the\r\nCrown, the subserviency of the judges, and the wide-spread panic among\r\nthe higher classes. The common people, though alarmed at the strength of\r\nthis combination, relied upon the innocence of the accused persons; but,\r\nat all events, (though the more timid erased their names from the roll\r\nof the societies,) the mass resolved to make a stand for the freedom of\r\nspeech and the press, and the right of associating for a redress of\r\ngrievances, worthy of the exigency. From the papers of the London\r\nSociety, which had been seized, it appeared that the members\r\ncontemplated holding a National Convention to promote Parliamentary\r\nreform; and this was regarded as a conspiracy to subvert the monarchy\r\nand establish a republic!\r\n\r\nI have stated the crime with which these men were charged. Indicted for\r\nconspiring to subvert the monarchy, depose the King, and compass his\r\ndeath, it was only pretended that they had uttered and published\r\nseditious words with the intent to alter his Government; when, in fact,\r\nthey had only advocated radical reforms in the two Houses of Parliament.\r\nThe _existence_ of the constitutional societies and their _doings_ were\r\nclearly legal. No doubt, many unguarded and some unwarranted expressions\r\nabout the King and Parliament had been used. But nothing had been said\r\nor done which, on a fair construction, exposed the parties to a just\r\nconviction of any crime. Most assuredly they were not guilty of high\r\ntreason; and as surely their words and deeds were tame and puerile,\r\ncompared with what the English press and people have since said and done\r\nin the ear of Ministers and under the eye of Majesty. In short, they\r\nwere to be immolated on the judicial guillotine of \"CONSTRUCTIVE\r\nTREASON.\"\r\n\r\nThe character and station of the prisoners excited the interest of\r\ndifferent ranks of society. They had been shut up in the Tower six\r\nmonths, closely confined, and all access to them by their friends\r\ndenied. Hardy was a shoemaker, and, with two or three others, was from\r\nthe upper strata of the lower orders. Kyd was a barrister; Holcroft, a\r\ndramatic writer; Joyce, a minister; and Thelwall, a political lecturer.\r\nThese belonged to the middle class. JOHN HORNE TOOKE, the most\r\nconsiderable person among them, held a debatable position in the higher\r\ncircles. He was a gentleman of limited aristocratic connections, and a\r\nscholar of rare and varied learning. He had taken holy orders in his\r\nyouth, but had long ago left the altars of the church for the closet of\r\nthe student and the forum of the politician. He was the author of the\r\nprofound philosophical treatise on the English language, called \"_The\r\nDiversions of Purley_.\" Many then supposed him to be the author of\r\nJunius. He had had a violent newspaper controversy, feigned or real,\r\nwith that writer, and had worsted him. He was the ablest pamphleteer and\r\ndebater among the ultra-liberals, and was ever ready, with his keen pen\r\nand bold tongue, to contend with the scribes of the Government through\r\nthe press, or its orators on the rostrum, and he never gave cause to\r\neither to congratulate themselves on the results of the encounter.\r\nNearly twenty years ago he had stood before the same tribunal, and\r\ndefended himself with consummate skill, and a courage bordering on\r\naudacity, against a prosecution for publishing a defense of \"the\r\nAmerican rebels\" at the battle of Lexington. He and his associates were\r\nnow to make a stand for their lives.\r\n\r\nThe trials took place at the Old Bailey, in October and November, 1794,\r\nand extended through several weeks. The prisoners were defended by\r\nErskine, whose name was a tower of strength, and Gibbs, the very\r\nembodiment of legal knowledge, (Tooke aiding in his own case,) whilst\r\nScott, long-headed, learned, and unscrupulous, assisted by the Solicitor\r\nGeneral, prosecuted for the Crown. The hall and the passages leading to\r\nit were densely thronged with persons of all ranks and conditions, eager\r\nspectators of or participants in, the most memorable struggle which the\r\ncourts of the common law have witnessed. No overt _acts_ of any moment\r\ncould be proved against either of the accused, and the prosecution had\r\nto rely mainly on ambiguous words and writings of doubtful import. The\r\nwhole power of the Court of the King, and the Judges of the King's\r\nCourt, was brought to bear upon the doomed prisoners, aided by the\r\nmultifarious lore and subtle reasoning of the Attorney General. Every\r\ndoubtful word was distorted, every ambiguous look transformed into\r\nlurking treason. The rules of evidence were put to the rack, to admit\r\nbits of letters and conversations, written and uttered by others than\r\nthe accused, and to hold them responsible for all that had been said and\r\ndone by every man who, at any time and anywhere, had belonged to the\r\nsocieties, or taken part in their discussions. The friends of the\r\nprisoners spoke with bated breath, as the trials proceeded; for they\r\nknew, if the prosecution succeeded, a reign of terror had begun, in\r\nwhich the King was to enact the Robespierre, and they were to be his\r\nvictims. But neither the ravings of the Court at Windsor, nor the\r\npartialities of the Court at London, could suffice against the learning,\r\nthe logic, the skill, the vigilance, the eloquence, the courage, the\r\nsoul, which Erskine threw into his cause. He battled as if his own life\r\nhad been at hazard. He knew that twelve \"good and true men\" stood\r\nbetween the lion and his prey. The Court ruled that if the jury\r\nbelieved the discussions and writings of the prisoners, or of the\r\nsocieties to which they belonged, tended to subvert the monarchy and\r\ndepose the King, or change the Constitution, they must find them guilty.\r\nBut Erskine maintained, with a power of argument which, for the moment,\r\nshook the faith of the Court, that _for British subjects to utter their\r\nsentiments, in_ ANY FORM, _concerning the Government of their country,\r\nwas not_ TREASON. So thought the jurors, (though the Court leaned\r\nheavily to the side of the Crown,) and one after another these hunted\r\nplebeians passed the terrible ordeal. The King lost; the People won.\r\nThey shouted their triumph so loud, that he heard it within his palace,\r\nand the crowned lion growled, gnashed his royal teeth, and beat the bars\r\nof his constitutional cage, till his anointed head throbbed with\r\nanguish.\r\n\r\nHardy, whose case was extremely perilous, was first set to the bar. His\r\ntrial lasted nine days. Tooke's came next, and Thelwall's next; when the\r\nprosecutors, frantic with rage and mortification at their signal\r\noverthrow, abandoned the contest. When Tooke was acquitted, the joy of\r\nthe people knew no bounds. He was an old reformer, had ever been the\r\nsteady advocate of popular rights, and was the idol of the Radicals. He\r\nhad suffered much before in the common cause. His library had been\r\nrepeatedly ransacked for treasonable papers, his family insulted, and\r\nhis person again and again thrust into prison. And now they had seen him\r\nstand for six days, battling with the Court which lowered upon him, and\r\nbearing unruffled the taunts with which the Government witnesses had\r\npoorly withstood his searching cross-examination, contending for a life\r\nwhose every pulsation had been given to the service of the people. When\r\nthe foreman pronounced the words, \"Not Guilty,\" the arches of Old Bailey\r\nrang with plaudits. After addressing a few words to the Court, he turned\r\nto Scott, and said: \"I hope, Mr. Attorney General, that this verdict\r\nwill be a warning to you not to attempt again to shed men's blood on\r\nlame suspicions and doubtful inferences.\" He then thanked the jury with\r\nmuch emotion for the life they had spared to him. The entire panel shed\r\ntears--the very men who had been so obviously packed to convict him,\r\nthat at the opening of the trial Erskine said, \"Mr. Tooke, they are\r\nmurdering you!\" The populace bore the old patriot through the passages\r\nto the street, where they sent up shout upon shout. It was a great day\r\nfor Reformers, and its anniversary is still celebrated by the Radicals\r\nof England.\r\n\r\nErskine's speech for Hardy (whose case was very critical, and the first\r\none tried,) is one of the most splendid specimens of popular juridical\r\neloquence on record. Owing to the running contests on points of law and\r\nevidence, constantly kept up while the trial went on, he lost his voice\r\nthe night before he was to address the jury. It returned to him in the\r\nmorning, and he was able to crowd seven hours full of such oratory as is\r\nrarely heard in our day. He regarded Hardy's acquittal or conviction not\r\nonly as the turning point in the fate of his eleven associates, but as\r\nsettling the question whether constructive treason should for long years\r\ntrack blood through the land, or its murderous steps be now brought to a\r\nfinal stand. He made a superhuman effort for victory, and achieved it.\r\nProfound as was his legal learning, eminent as were his reasoning\r\nfaculties, classical as was his taste, transcendent as were his\r\noratorical powers, all conspiring to place him not only at the head of\r\nthe English bar, but to rank him as the first advocate of modern times;\r\nyet all were overshadowed by the inflexible courage and hearty zeal with\r\nwhich he met this crisis of British freedom. With the combined power of\r\nthe King, his ministers, and his judges, arrayed against his clients and\r\nagainst him as their representative, seeking their blood and his\r\ndegradation, he cowered not, but maintained the home-born rights of his\r\nproscribed fellow-subjects with arguments so matchless, with eloquence\r\nso glowing, with courage so heroic, with constancy so generous, that his\r\nname will ever find a place in the hearts of all who prefer the rights\r\nof man to the prerogatives of power. But more than all; he exploded the\r\ndoctrines of constructive treason, and established the law on the true\r\nfoundation, that there must be some overt _act_ to constitute guilt; and\r\nhe reinscribed upon the Constitution of England the obliterated\r\nprinciple, that Englishmen may freely speak and publish their opinions\r\nconcerning the Government of their country without being guilty of\r\ntreason--a principle, under whose protecting shield they now utter their\r\ncomplaints, their denunciations even, in the very ear of Majesty\r\nitself.[1]\r\n\r\n  [1] The text states only a _legal_ truth. Practically there yet remain\r\n  great obstacles in the way of the free utterance of opinions hostile to\r\n  the Government--as witness the recent prosecutions of O'Connell, Jones,\r\n  &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n     Constructive Treason--The Law of Libel and Sedition--The Dean of\r\n     St. Asaph--The Rights of Juries--Erskine--Fox--Pitt.\r\n\r\n\r\nI took occasion in the last chapter to speak at some length of the\r\ntrials of Tooke, Hardy, and others, for high treason, in 1794, and of\r\nthe successful attack then made by Mr. ERSKINE on the doctrine of\r\nconstructive treason. Down to the period of these trials, the English\r\nlaw of treason was infamous. Among other things, treason was defined to\r\nbe waging war against the King, or compassing and imagining his death,\r\nor the overthrow of his Government. The law evidently contemplated the\r\ndoing of some _act_, designed and adapted to accomplish these ends. But\r\nthe construction of the courts had subverted this principle, and\r\ndeclared the mere utterance of _words_ high treason. In the reign of\r\nEdward IV, a citizen was executed for saying \"he would make his son heir\r\nof _the crown_;\" meaning, as was supposed, that he would make him the\r\nheir of his _inn_, called \"the Crown.\" Another, whose favorite buck the\r\nKing had wantonly killed, was executed for saying, \"he wished the buck,\r\nhorns and all, in the bowels of the man who counseled the King to kill\r\nit.\" The court gravely held, that as the King had killed it of his own\r\naccord, and so was his own counselor, this declaration was imagining the\r\nKing's death, and therefore treason! So it had been held, that using\r\nwords tending to overawe Parliament, and procure the repeal of a law,\r\nwas levying war on the King, and therefore treasonable. At length the\r\ncourts yielded to the doctrine that there must be some overt act to\r\nconstitute the crime. But they also held that, reducing words to\r\n_writing_ was an overt act, even though they were never read or printed!\r\nPeachum, a clergyman, was convicted of high treason for passages found\r\nin a sermon which had never been preached. The immortal Algernon Sidney\r\nwas executed, and his blood attainted, for some unpublished papers found\r\nin his closet, containing merely speculative opinions in favor of a\r\nrepublican form of government. It was in allusion to this judicial\r\nmurder by the infamous Jeffries, and to the fact that the record of the\r\nconviction had been destroyed, that Erskine, on the trial of Hardy,\r\nuttered the splendid anathema against \"those who took from the files the\r\nsentence against Sidney, which should have been left on record to all\r\nages, that it might arise and blacken in the sight, like the handwriting\r\non the wall before the Eastern tyrant, to deter from outrages upon\r\njustice.\" It has already been said that this peerless lawyer exploded\r\nthese dangerous doctrines, and made it safe for Englishmen to speak and\r\nwrite freely against the King and Government, without exposure to a\r\nconviction for treason.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the only salutary legal reform for which England is\r\nindebted to his exertions. Pernicious as is the existing law of CRIMINAL\r\nPROSECUTIONS FOR LIBELS AND SEDITIOUS WRITINGS in that country, it was\r\nvastly worse till his strong arguments and scathing appeals had shaken\r\nit to its foundations. A glance at the law. Any publication imputing bad\r\nmotives to King or Minister; or charging any branch of Government with\r\ncorruption, or a wish to infringe the liberties of the People; or which\r\ncast ridicule upon the Established Church; and any writing, printing, or\r\nspeaking, which tended to excite the People to hatred or contempt of the\r\nGovernment, or to change the laws in an improper manner, &c., were\r\nseditious libels, for which fine, imprisonment, the pillory, &c., might\r\nbe imposed. Nor was the truth of the libel any defense. Admirable\r\nsnares, these, to entangle unwary reformers, and catch game for the\r\nroyal household! And these bad laws were worse administered. _The\r\njuries had no power in their administration_--the only check in the\r\nhands of the People. The court withheld from the jury the question\r\nwhether a writing was libelous or seditious, and permitted them only to\r\ndecide whether the prisoner had published it. In a word, if the jury\r\nfound that he _published_, they must convict; and then the judge growled\r\nout the sentence. These trials were ready weapons for State prosecution\r\nin the hands of a tyrannical King and Ministry, with pliant judges at\r\ntheir beck; and in the latter half of the last century they were used\r\nwithout stint or mercy. They struck down Wilkes, Tooke, Woodfall, Muir,\r\nPalmer, Holt, Cartwright, and other liberals, for publications and\r\nspeeches in vindication of the People, which, at this day, would be held\r\nharmless even in England. Some were heavily fined, others imprisoned or\r\ntransported, others set on the pillory, or cropped and branded, their\r\nhouses broken open and searched, their wives and daughters insulted,\r\ntheir private papers rifled, their printing presses seized, their goods\r\nconfiscated, their names cast out as evil, and they might regard their\r\nlot as fortunate if their prospects for life were not utterly ruined.\r\nThe treatment of Muir and Palmer, in 1793, was barbarous. Muir was a\r\nrespectable barrister, and Palmer a clergyman of eminent literary\r\nattainments. They had merely addressed meetings and associations for\r\nParliamentary reform in Glasgow and Edinburgh, and reports of one or two\r\nof their speeches had been printed. Muir was sentenced to transportation\r\nfor fourteen years, and Palmer for seven. They were shipped off to\r\nBotany Bay with a cargo of common felons! Several other persons, for\r\nattending a Reform Convention in Edinburgh the same year, shared a like\r\nfate. These are trials which sunshine politicians of the liberal school\r\nnever contemplate, except to draw from them materials for rounding off\r\nfine periods about freedom and the rights of man. But they endear the\r\nsufferers to the struggling masses of their own time; and, in after\r\nyears, when the sons of the persecutors garnish their tombs, those who\r\nthen endure like trials swear by their memories and conjure with their\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nThe times of which I write were prolific of these State prosecutions.\r\nMr. Erskine was the ready counsel of the proscribed reformers then, as\r\nMr. Brougham was at a later period. His great effort on these trials was\r\nto convince the court that the juries had the right to decide upon the\r\ncharacter of the publication in making up their verdicts; or, in legal\r\nphrase, that they were \"judges both of law and fact.\" In this effort, he\r\nhad many a fierce conflict with the judges, when, with his usual\r\ncourage, he braved their rebukes and challenged the execution of their\r\nhinted threats to commit him for contempt. He always argued this point\r\nfully to the court, in the presence of the jury; and such was his\r\nmastery over the reason and the feelings, that he sometimes prevented a\r\nconviction when he could not obtain an acquittal. It was in an affair of\r\nthis sort that he had a quarrel with Mr. Justice Buller, a judge who\r\ncoupled double the imperiousness of Mansfield with half his talents, and\r\nwhose frown, glowering out from under his huge wig, has silenced many a\r\nbarrister of more than common nerve. The respectable DEAN OF ST. ASAPH,\r\nwho breathed the mountain air of Wales, published a clever political\r\ntract, under the guise of a dialogue between King George and a farmer.\r\nErskine went down to defend him. Buller presided at the trial. Erskine\r\nargued his favorite topic with more than his accustomed ability. The\r\njury listened with absorbing attention; the judge with impatient\r\ninterruptions. He charged furiously against the Dean, and told the jury,\r\nif they believed he published the tract, they must render a general\r\nverdict of guilty. The words of reason and power of the great barrister,\r\nand his piercing eyes, which riveted everything within their gaze, went\r\nwith them to their room. They returned a verdict in these words: \"Guilty\r\nof publishing only.\" The astonished judge ordered them out again, with\r\ndirections to render a general verdict of guilty. Erskine interposed,\r\nand insisted upon their right to render such a verdict as they had. The\r\njudge replied tartly, and the jury retired. Again they came in with the\r\nsame verdict. The judge reprimanded them, while Erskine insisted that\r\ntheir verdict should be recorded. Buller retorted, explained his law to\r\nthe refractory panel, and sent them out. The third time they appeared\r\nwith the same verdict. The judge grew furious, and said, unless they\r\nrendered a general verdict, he should order the clerk to enter it\r\n\"guilty.\" Erskine protested in strong terms. Buller ordered him to sit\r\ndown. Erskine said he would not sit down, nor would he allow the court\r\nto record a verdict of guilty against his client, when the jury had\r\nrendered no such verdict. Buller hinted at commitment. Erskine defied\r\nhim. The jury were frightened, and, in their panic, assented to a\r\ngeneral verdict of guilty.[2] Erskine excepted, and carried the case to\r\nthe full bench. But the day of triumph was at hand. So clearly had he in\r\nhis great arguments exposed the iniquity of the rule, (if, indeed, it\r\nwas law at all,) and so pertinaciously had he contested it on the trial\r\nof the Dean, that Parliament passed a declaratory act soon after, (thus\r\nadmitting that Erskine was right,) giving jurors, in these prosecutions,\r\nthe power to render a verdict upon the whole offense charged, _i. e._,\r\nmaking them \"judges of the law as well as the fact.\"[3] I need not say\r\nthat, after this, prosecutions for seditious libels became less potent\r\nand frequent weapons in the hands of royal and ministerial persecutors,\r\nand reformers breathed freer.\r\n\r\n  [2] This scene is given from memory--the report not being at hand.\r\n\r\n  [3] A like contest early arose in this country. Congress passed an act\r\n  similar to that of the English, in 1798. In the State of New York, the\r\n  case of _People vs. Croswell_, for a libel on Jefferson, attracted great\r\n  attention. It was tried in 1803. The judge charged the jury according to\r\n  the old English law, and the defendant was convicted. It was carried\r\n  before the full bench, and argued in 1804. The speech of Alexander\r\n  Hamilton, for the defendant, was one of the ablest ever delivered in\r\n  America. The court being equally divided in opinion, the Legislature,\r\n  the next year, passed a declaratory act, giving to juries the right to\r\n  determine the law and the fact. This is now the prevailing law of the\r\n  country. Croswell's case is reported in 3d Johnson's Cases.\r\n\r\nIt does the heart good to contemplate talents like Erskine's devoted to\r\nsuch purposes. To see the foremost lawyer of his time, in the midst of\r\nwide-spread aristocratic clamor, and despite the fulminations of kings\r\nand ministers and judges, take the side of humble men, who are denounced\r\nas incendiaries, agrarians, levelers, French Jacobins, traitors, and\r\ninfidels, plotting to murder their sovereign, upheave his throne, and\r\nprostrate the altars of the church, (and these are but a tithe of the\r\ncatalogue,) and for years perform prodigies of labor for poor clients\r\nand poorer pay, thus blocking up the avenues to preferment in his\r\ncherished profession, and all for the love he bears the common cause!\r\nSuch a spectacle should go somewhat to blunt the edge of those taunts so\r\nconstantly aimed at a profession which he adored and adorned, and which,\r\nin every struggle for human rights, has furnished leaders to the popular\r\nparty among the bravest of the brave. The law, like every other\r\nprofession, has its scum and its vermin, and yields its share of\r\ndishonest men. But they are dishonest not because they are lawyers, but\r\nbecause they are scoundrels, and would have been so had they chosen to\r\nbe merchants, physicians, or horse-jockies. When reproaching the whole\r\nlegal fraternity as a \"pack of licensed swindlers,\" it might be well to\r\nremember that the most conspicuous rebels and martyrs of English\r\nfreedom, in the olden times, were lawyers--that Erskine, Emmet, Romilly,\r\nMackintosh, O'Connell, and Brougham, of later and milder days, were\r\nlawyers; and that Jefferson, Adams, Otis, Sherman, Henry, and Hamilton,\r\nwith many other bold spirits who thundered and lightened during the\r\nstorm of the American revolution, were lawyers.\r\n\r\nBut we must leave Mr. Erskine by saying, that he possessed ability and\r\nlearning to maintain the boldest positions; eloquence for the most\r\nthrilling appeals; imagination to sustain the loftiest flights. He was\r\ngraceful in action, melodious in elocution, and had an eye of whose\r\nfascinating power jurors were often heard to speak. He was a wit and a\r\nlogician--a lawyer and a reformer--a man, cast in the noblest mold of\r\nhis species.\r\n\r\nMr. Erskine was powerfully sustained in his efforts for law reform by\r\nthe great liberal leader in the House of Commons. CHARLES JAMES FOX\r\ndeserves a conspicuous place among the early Reformers of England.\r\nEntering Parliament in 1768, when just turned twenty-one, he rallied\r\nunder the banner of Mr. Burke, then the chief debater on the Whig side,\r\nwhose lead he followed through the doubtful contest on American\r\nquestions; and when victory, and peace, and independence, crowned their\r\nefforts, the chief resigned the standard of opposition to the hands of\r\nhis younger and more robust lieutenant. Fox is called \"the disciple of\r\nBurke,\" and, after their unnatural estrangement, he gratefully said, \"I\r\nhave learnt more from Burke alone than from all other men and authors.\"\r\nHe remained in the Commons till his death, in 1806; and though hampered\r\nby aristocratic connections and the leadership of his party, his\r\ngenerous nature and warm heart, through nearly forty years of\r\nParliamentary life carried his great talents to the liberal side. He\r\nheaded the forlorn hope of English freedom during the panic immediately\r\nfollowing the French revolution, and in the darkest and stormiest nights\r\nof that gloomy period, his voice sounded clear and firm above the\r\ntempest, hurling defiance at his foes, and bidding the few friends of\r\nman and constitutional liberty who stood around him to be of good cheer,\r\nfor the day of their redemption was drawing on. His speech against the\r\nstamp act, the taxation of the colonies, the American war, the test act,\r\nthe suspension of the _habeas corpus_, the treason and sedition bills,\r\nthe slave trade; and in favor of Parliamentary reform, religious\r\ntoleration, Catholic emancipation, the rights of juries, and of peace,\r\ncontain volumes of liberal principles which endear his name to the\r\nfriends of humanity in both hemispheres. As Erskine was the first\r\nadvocate that ever stood at the English bar, so Fox was the first\r\ndebater that ever appeared in its Commons. Burke wrote of him, after\r\ntheir separation: \"I knew him when he was nineteen; since which, he has\r\nrisen to be the most brilliant and accomplished debater the world ever\r\nsaw.\" His argumentative powers were of the highest order, and his wit,\r\nhis invective, and his appeals to the judgment and feelings unrivaled.\r\nIn the partisan warfare of extemporaneous debate, he bore down on his\r\nantagonists with an energy which, when fully roused, bordered on\r\nferocity. But it was the ferocity of impassioned logic and intense\r\nreasoning. Not content with once going over the ground in controversy,\r\nhe traveled it again and again, unfolding new arguments and adding\r\nadditional facts, till his searching and vigorous eloquence had\r\ndiscovered and demolished every objection that lay in his track. The\r\nvery embodiment of the reasoning element in man, he saw through his\r\nsubject with rapid glances, grappled sturdily with all its strong\r\npoints, despised mere ornaments, rejected all bewildering flights of the\r\nimagination, and shunned excursions into collateral fields which skirted\r\nhis line of argument. In these latter respects he was totally unlike his\r\ngreat master. As his reasoning powers were cast in the most colossal\r\nmold, so his heart was of the finest and noblest quality. Mackintosh has\r\njustly said, that \"he united in a most remarkable degree the seemingly\r\nrepugnant characters of the mildest of men and the most vehement of\r\norators.\" His appeals to magnanimity, to generosity, to integrity, to\r\njustice, to mercy, thrilled the soul of Freedom, while the tide of\r\nconsuming lava which he poured on hypocrisy, meanness, dissimulation,\r\ncruelty, and oppression, made the grovelers at the footstool of power\r\nhide with fear and shame. He was a statesman of the broadest and most\r\nliberal views. His capacious mind was stored with political knowledge;\r\nhe had deeply studied the institutions of ancient and modern States; and\r\nno man better understood the general and constitutional history of his\r\nown country, nor the delicate machinery which regulated its complicated\r\nforeign and domestic affairs. As bold as a lion, he never cowered before\r\nthe King, his ministers, or his minions; but gloried in being the\r\nmouthpiece of out-door Reformers, whose radical principles and humble\r\nconnections prevented their admission within the Parliamentary walls. He\r\nrepeated the coarse opinions of Cartwright and his companions, in a\r\nplace whose doors they were forbidden to darken, but in language worthy\r\nof the classic scion of Holland House. He was of invaluable service to\r\nthe radical party, in gaining them favor with the aristocratic and\r\nlearned Whigs, because he could throw over their principles the shield\r\nof argument, adorn them with the grace of scholarship, and dignify them\r\nwith the luster of birth and station. In this regard his conduct might\r\nbe profitably studied by his professed admirers on this side of the\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\nMr. Fox was totally unlike his great rival. Pitt was stately, taciturn,\r\nand of an austere temper. Fox was easy, social, and of a kindly\r\ndisposition. Pitt was tall and grave, and, entering the House carefully\r\ndressed, walked proudly to the head of the Treasury bench, and took his\r\nseat as dignified and dumb as a statue. Fox was burly and jovial,\r\nentered the House in a slouched hat and with a careless air, and, as he\r\napproached the Opposition benches, had a nod for this learned city\r\nmember, and a joke for that wealthy knight of the shire, and sat down,\r\nas much at ease as if he were lounging in the back parlor of a country\r\ninn. Pitt, as the adage runs, could \"speak a King's speech off-hand,\" so\r\nconsecutive were his sentences; and his round, smooth periods delighted\r\nthe aristocracy of all parties. Fox made the Lords of the Treasury quail\r\nas he declaimed in piercing tones against ministerial corruption, while\r\nhis friends shouted \"hear! hear!\" and applauded till the House shook.\r\nPitt's sentences were pompous and sonorous, and often \"their sound\r\nrevealed their own hollowness.\" Fox uttered sturdy Anglo-Saxon sense;\r\nevery word pregnant with meaning. Pitt was a thorough business man, and\r\nrelied for success in debate upon careful preparation. Fox despised the\r\ndrudgery of the office, and relied upon his intuitive perceptions and\r\nhis robust strength. Pitt was the greater Secretary--Fox the greater\r\nCommoner. Pitt's oratory was like the frozen stalactites and pyramids\r\nwhich glitter around Niagara in mid-winter, stately, clear, and cold.\r\nFox's like the vehement waters which sweep over its brink, and roar and\r\nboil in the abyss below. Pitt, in his great efforts, only erected\r\nhimself the more proudly, and uttered more full Johnsonian sentences,\r\nsprinkling his dignified but monotonous \"state-paper style\" with pungent\r\nsarcasms, speaking as one having authority, and commanding that it might\r\nstand fast. Fox on such occasions reasoned from first principles,\r\ndenouncing where he could not persuade, and reeling under his great\r\nthoughts, until his excited feelings rocked him, like the ocean in a\r\nstorm. Pitt displayed the most rhetoric, and his mellow voice charmed,\r\nlike the notes of an organ. Fox displayed the most argument, and his\r\nshrill tones pierced like arrows. Pitt had an icy taste; Fox a fiery\r\nlogic. Pitt had art; Fox nature. Pitt was dignified, cool, cautious; Fox\r\nmanly, generous, brave. Pitt had a mind; Fox a soul. Pitt was a majestic\r\nautomaton; Fox a living man. Pitt was the Minister of the King; Fox the\r\nChampion of the People. Both were the early advocates of Parliamentary\r\nreform; but Pitt retreated, while Fox advanced; and both joined in\r\ndenouncing and abolishing the horrors of the middle passage. Both died\r\nthe same year, and they sleep side by side in Westminster Abbey, their\r\ndust mingling with that of their mutual friend Wilberforce; while over\r\ntheir tombs watches with eagle eye and extended arm the molded form of\r\nChatham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n     The French Revolution--The Continental Policy of Mr. Pitt--The\r\n     Policy of Mr. Fox and his Followers--The Continental Wars--Mr.\r\n     Sheridan--Mr. Burke--Mr. Perceval.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn determining whether the policy which Pitt and his successors pursued\r\ntowards France, from 1792 to 1815, was wise for England and beneficial\r\nto Europe, an American republican will remember that it was sustained by\r\nthe party which ever resisted all social and political improvement among\r\nthe people--that the enemies of change warred on the Directory, the\r\nConsulate, the Empire--that the patrons of existing abuses restored the\r\nBourbons. Nor will he forget that this policy was steadily opposed by\r\nthe friends of enlightened progress and useful reform--the champions of\r\ncivil and religious freedom. The specious reasoning and showy\r\ndeclamations of a score of Alisons will never destroy these facts.\r\n\r\nFrance, equally with Great Britain, had the right to enjoy the\r\nGovernment of its choice. But the latter, early in 1793, declined to\r\nnegotiate or correspond with the former, because it was a republic; and\r\nrefusing to receive the credentials of its minister, ordered him to quit\r\nthe kingdom. France, sustained by the law of nations, declared war\r\nagainst the Power which had insulted her. Pitt asserted that the French\r\nrevolution had no sufficient cause in the nature of the Government or\r\nthe condition of the people, and was the offspring of a reckless spirit\r\nof innovation. He avowed his determination to put down the republic,\r\nrestore the monarchy, and maintain the cause of legitimacy in Europe.\r\nThis avowal was met by the declaration of the liberal party, that the\r\ntrue cause of the revolution was the undue restriction and limitation of\r\nthe rights and privileges of the people; and that, however it might be\r\nperverted, its real object was to wrest from the Government what had\r\nbeen unjustly withheld from its subjects. They demanded, therefore, that\r\nthe diplomatic representative of France should be received by the\r\nministry; and they resisted all interference with its internal affairs,\r\nall attempts to suppress liberal movements in Europe, all efforts to\r\nuphold its crumbling thrones. They plead for peace and an armed\r\nneutrality. And, after Napoleon's schemes of conquest were disclosed,\r\nthey contended that England ought not to unite in a coalition for his\r\noverthrow, so long as it was a battle among kings, but should wait till\r\n_the people_ of the continent requested assistance; and even then, that\r\nit ought not to be given till the rulers of the endangered States were\r\npledged to grant reasonable privileges to their subjects. On this\r\nelevated ground did the liberal party take its stand. But Pitt,\r\nrepresenting only the monarchical and privileged orders, at the outset\r\nof the conflict pledged the power and resources of England to the\r\naccomplishment of his ends; and his policy was steadily followed, with\r\nruinous and mortifying results, until the European combination of\r\n1814-15 finally crushed Napoleon at Waterloo, and restored the Bourbon\r\nto his throne.\r\n\r\nAnd what did England gain by her armies and fleets, her intrigues in\r\nforeign cabinets and subsidies of men and money? True, Napoleon was\r\nprostrated, But she had spent L600 000,000 in doing it. At the\r\ncommencement of the war, her debt was less than L240,000,000. At its\r\nclose, it had swelled to more than L840,000,000! Centuries of taxation\r\nto restore the Bourbons to a throne which they cannot retain, and to\r\npostpone for fifty years the general overthrow of monarchy in Europe!\r\nThe seventh descending son of the youngest Englishman alive will curse\r\nthe day that Pitt entered on this crusade against Destiny. When the\r\nunnatural fever of the contest abated, the reaction, the retribution,\r\ncame. Peace had returned, but she was not accompanied by her\r\ntwin-sister, Plenty. English trade, commerce, manufactures, agriculture,\r\nlanguished--laborers wandered through the provinces in search of\r\nemployment--the country sunk exhausted into the arms of bankruptcy. The\r\nsmoke of battle no longer blinding the eye, the people began to look\r\nabout and inquire, \"What have we gained by all this outgush of blood and\r\ntreasure?\" The wealthy saw before them ages of remorseless taxation--the\r\npoor clamored in the streets for bread--all but the extreme privileged\r\nclasses regarded the result of the war as a triumph over themselves. At\r\npeace with all the world, (almost the first time for three-fourths of a\r\ncentury), the nation was the scene of internal discords more threatening\r\nthan foreign levy. Nothing but general lassitude, and the pressure of\r\nmisfortunes common to all, prevented a revolution.\r\n\r\nThis contest was injurious to England in another way. It so _possessed_\r\nthe public mind that there was little room left for domestic\r\nimprovement. Meanwhile, the cause of reform was turned out of doors. The\r\nFrench Revolution was a God-send to Pitt and the Tories. Seizing upon\r\nits early excesses, they conjured with them thirty years, frightening\r\nthe middling men from their propriety, and terrifying even the giant\r\nsoul of Burke. The \"horrors of the French revolution\" were thrown in the\r\nface of every man who demanded reform. The clamors of the tired and\r\nfleeced suitors in Lord Eldon's court were silenced by \"the horrors of\r\nthe French revolution.\" Old Sarum and Grampound lengthened out their\r\n\"rotten\" existence by supping on \"the horrors of the French revolution.\"\r\nPoint to the festering corruption of the Church Establishment, and it\r\nlifted up its holy hands at \"the horrors of the French revolution.\" The\r\nCatholics were persecuted, the Irish gibbeted, and printers transported,\r\nto atone for \"the horrors of the French revolution.\" The poor starved\r\nin damp cellars, whilst the landlord fattened his protected soil with\r\n\"the horrors of the French revolution.\" In a word, these \"horrors\"\r\nconstituted the chief staple of Tory argument and declamation, and were\r\na conclusive answer to all who asked for cheap bread, religious\r\ntoleration, law reform, reduced taxes, and an enlarged suffrage.\r\n\r\nThe lessons of wisdom, so dearly purchased by this scheme of Continental\r\ninterference, have not been thrown away on a nation which spent so much\r\nto gain so little. The second French revolution was followed by England\r\ngranting Parliamentary Reform, to prevent a revolution at home. The\r\nthird revolution, which prostrated a monarchy, and reared a republic in\r\na day, was promptly recognized and respected by England, whose Premier\r\ndeclared that she heartily accorded to the people of France the right to\r\nordain for themselves such a system of Government as they might choose!\r\nMen may prate eternally about the virtues of Louis XVI, the grasping\r\nambition of Napoleon, the far-seeing sagacity of Burke, and the wisdom\r\nand firmness of Pitt, and it will still remain true, that the principles\r\nthrown up with the fire and blood of the great French eruption will yet\r\nwork out the regeneration of Europe.\r\n\r\nMR. SHERIDAN was as steady a supporter of freedom, and as inflexible an\r\nopponent of Pitt, as a man of so volatile a temperament could well be.\r\nThis gentleman is best known on our side of the Atlantic as the author\r\nof the comedy the \"School for Scandal,\" and of a speech on the trial of\r\nWarren Hastings. The comedy still holds a deservedly high place on the\r\nstage. The speech, which once claimed a position at the head of English\r\nforensic oratory, is no doubt much overrated. The intense interest\r\npervading the public mind in respect to the impeachment of the conqueror\r\nand ruler of a hundred millions of the people of India--the august\r\ncharacter of the tribunal, the peers and judges of the realm--the\r\nimposing talents of the committee by whom the Commons sent up the\r\narticles of impeachment, consisting of Burke, Fox, North, Grey, Wyndham,\r\nSheridan, with other lights worthy to shine in such a constellation--the\r\nromantic branch of Hastings's administration, the opening of which was\r\nassigned to Sheridan--the gorgeous colors which he spread upon the\r\noriental canvas--the theatrical style in which he pronounced his oration\r\nbefore a learned, fashionable, and sympathizing audience, all conspired\r\nto give to his effort a temporary fame alike extraordinary and undeserved.\r\nNor was the immediate effect of his two days' coruscation diminished by\r\nthe tragical manner in which he contrived, at its close, to sink backward\r\ninto the arms of Burke, who, transported beyond measure, hugged him as\r\nunaffectedly as if his generous and unsuspecting nature had not been duped\r\nby a mere stage trick.\r\n\r\nBut though he occasionally used the clap-traps of the theater, Sheridan\r\nwas a debater to be shunned rather than encountered. Pitt dreaded him.\r\nLying in wait till the Minister had addressed the House, the Drury Lane\r\nmanager used to let fly at him such a cloud of stinging arrows, pointed\r\nwith sarcasm and poisoned with invective, that the stately Premier could\r\nnot conceal his mortification, nor hardly retain his seat till the storm\r\nhad passed away. No Parliamentarian ever inspired so much dread in his\r\nopponents, and won so much applause from his friends, with so scanty a\r\nstock of statesmanlike acquirements. His political knowledge was\r\ngathered from the columns of the current newspapers and the discussions\r\nin the club-rooms, and his literary stores were made up from the modern\r\npoetry and drama of England. True, he was educated at Harrow, but he\r\nthrew aside Demosthenes and Cicero for Congreve and Vanburgh, and wrote\r\ncomedies when he should have studied mathematics. He never claimed to be\r\na statesman, and only aspired to be an orator. To shine as a dazzling\r\ndeclaimer, he bent all the powers of his intense and elastic mind. He\r\nattended debating clubs, and caught up the best sayings--practiced\r\nattitudes and tones in the green-room--set down every keen thought which\r\noccurred to him in a note-book--conned his lesson--then entered the\r\nHouse, and rushing into the arena of debate with the bound and air of a\r\ngladiator, won the reputation of being the readiest wit, the most\r\nskillful off-hand disputant, and the most gorgeous orator of the day.\r\nAnd it was the day of Burke, Pitt, Fox, Erskine, Grattan, and Wyndham!\r\nLord Chesterfield was not so very wrong when he told his son that, even\r\nin Parliament, more depended upon the manner of saying a thing, than\r\nupon the matter of which it was composed. Though his taste was formed on\r\nthe flashy model of the modern drama, and in the composition of his\r\nnumerous tropes and metaphors he did not always distinguish between\r\ntinsel and gold, between painted glass and pure diamonds, yet he\r\ngenerally succeeded in doing what he intended--producing a tremendous\r\nsensation. His rockets set the hemisphere in a blaze; nor was he always\r\ncareful on whose head the sticks fell; for he spared neither friends nor\r\nfoes, if he must thereby lose a good hit.\r\n\r\nThough Sheridan regarded the color of the husk more than the character\r\nof the kernel, he uttered much that will perish only with the English\r\ntongue. In an attack on Ministers, who were attempting to carry a bill\r\nagainst the freedom of the press, he exclaimed, \"Give them a corrupt\r\nHouse of Lords; give them a venal House of Commons; give them a\r\ntyrannical Prince; give them a truckling Court--and let me but have an\r\nunfettered press, and I will defy them to encroach a hair's breadth upon\r\nthe liberties of England\"--a passage worthy of Chatham. During the\r\ntreason trials, in 1794, he poured a torrent of ridicule upon the\r\nproceedings, which did not a little toward restoring a panic-stricken\r\npublic to its senses. An extract will give an idea of his sarcasm. In\r\nreplying to Pitt, he said, \"I own there was something in the case; quite\r\nenough to disturb the virtuous sensibilities and loyal terrors of the\r\nright honorable gentleman. But, so hardened is this side of the House,\r\nthat our fears did not much disturb us. On the first trial, one pike was\r\nproduced. This was, however, withdrawn. Then a terrific instrument was\r\ntalked of, for the annihilation of his Majesty's cavalry, which, upon\r\nevidence, appeared to be a _te-totum_ in a window at Sheffield. But I\r\nhad forgot--there was also a camp in a back shop; an arsenal provided\r\nwith nine muskets; and an exchequer, containing exactly the same number\r\nof pounds--no, let me be accurate, it was nine pounds and one bad\r\nshilling. * * * * The alarm had been brought in with great pomp and\r\ncircumstance on a Saturday morning. At night, the Duke of Richmond\r\nstationed himself, among other curiosities, at the Tower, and a great\r\nmunicipal officer, the Lord Mayor, made an appalling discovery in the\r\nEast. He found out that there was in Cornhill a debating society, where\r\npeople went to buy treason at sixpence a head; where it was retailed to\r\nthem by inch of candle; and five minutes, measured by the glass, were\r\nallowed to each traitor, to perform his part in overturning the State.\r\nIn Edinburgh an insurrection was planned; the soldiers were to be\r\ncorrupted: and this turned out to be--by giving each man sixpence for\r\nporter. Now, what the scarcity of money and rations may be in that part\r\nof the country, I cannot tell; but it does strike me that the system of\r\ncorruption has not been carried to any great extent. Then, too, numbers\r\nwere kept in pay; they were drilled in a dark room, by a sergeant in a\r\nbrown coat; and on a given signal they were to sally from a back\r\nkitchen, and overturn the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nThough this celebrated orator was wayward in his pursuits, and\r\nhabitually intemperate, yet, from the time he entered Parliament in 1780\r\ntill his sun began to decline, he ever sustained the liberal cause, and\r\nhis rare talents bore with striking effect against the Continental\r\npolicy of Pitt, and in favor of Irish Regeneration, Parliamentary\r\nReform, the freedom of the press, and the rights of the people.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of EDMUND BURKE, than whom, no man could afford a stronger\r\ncontrast to Sheridan. He had an original, daring genius, but it was\r\nsustained by a broad and comprehensive judgment. His imagination was as\r\ngorgeous as ever plumed the wing of eloquence, but it was enriched and\r\ninvigorated by learning vast and varied. Until his mind became\r\nengrossed, not to say _possessed_ with the subject which occupied the\r\nlatter years of his great life, (the French revolution,) he was the\r\nadvocate and ornament of progressive freedom. He first led and then\r\nfollowed Fox in all the lines of policy which the liberal party pursued\r\nfrom 1765 to 1790, when they separated, and Burke became not so much the\r\nadvocate of Pitt and his Tories, as the opponent of France and its\r\nRepublicans; choosing thereafter, as he expressed it, to be a Whig,\r\n\"without coining to himself Whig principles from a French die, unknown\r\nto the impress of our fathers in the Constitution.\" He left Parliament\r\nin 1794, and died in 1797. During the last six years of his life he\r\nseemed almost diseased by the excesses of the French revolution; and\r\nwhatever subject he surveyed, on whatever ground he looked, he appeared\r\nto see naught but the convulsions of that tragedy. The vivid impressions\r\nwhich he received he transferred to publications which glowed with his\r\nfervid soul, and produced a prodigious sensation amongst the higher\r\norders of his countrymen. But take him all in all, his was the most\r\nmagnificent mind of modern England. If called to designate the most\r\nremarkable name which adorns its later annals, to whose would we so\r\nunhesitatingly point as to his? Is he not entitled to a place among the\r\nfive most extraordinary men which that kingdom has produced--Bacon,\r\nShakspeare, Newton, Milton, Burke? He possessed the multifarious\r\nlearning of our Adams, the intellectual grasp of our Marshall, the\r\nmetaphysical subtlety of our Edwards, the logical energy of our Webster,\r\nthe soaring imagination of our Wirt, the fervid glow of our Clay; and he\r\nwas the equal of each in his most cultivated field. As a Parliamentary\r\nleader, he was inferior to Fox and Pitt. His essay-like style was not\r\nadapted to so popular a body as the House of Commons. His speeches wore\r\nthe air of the academy rather than the forum; and much of his discourse\r\nwas too elaborate, too learned, too philosophical, too ornate, to be\r\nappreciated by the general run of commonplace sort of men that drift\r\ninto the halls of legislation. During the thirty years he participated\r\nin affairs, there fell from his lips and pen an amount of political\r\nsagacity, far-seeing statesmanship, philosophical disquisition, and\r\noratorical display, all set off and adorned by an amplitude of learning,\r\na majesty of diction, and a brilliancy of imagery, the fourth of which\r\nwould have carried their author's name to posterity as one of the\r\nremarkable men of his time. He who thinks this eulogium extravagant has\r\nonly to find its confirmation in the mines of intellectual wealth which\r\nlie embedded in the sixteen volumes of the works he has given to his\r\ncountry and the world, to his cotemporaries and to posterity. True,\r\nthere will be found, mingled with these strata of pure gold, veins of\r\nimpracticability, sophistry, prejudice, extravagance, and violence. His\r\nlater writings, and in many respects his most grand and beautiful, are\r\ndisfigured by a morbid dread of change, and obscured by a gloomy\r\ndistrust of the capacities of man for self-government; proving, that\r\nthough gifted with genius beyond most mortals, he was not endowed with\r\nthe Divine spirit of prophecy. But it is equally true, that while the\r\nEnglish language is read, the speeches and writings of Edmund Burke will\r\nbe classed with the richest treasures of the statesman, the philosopher,\r\nand the scholar.\r\n\r\nNext to the curse of a military chieftain attempting to adapt the\r\ntactics of the camp to the regulations of the cabinet, is the nuisance\r\nof a narrow-minded lawyer carrying the prim rules of the bar into the\r\ncouncils of the State, and aiming to be a statesman when he is only\r\ncapable of being a pettifogger. On the downfall of the Grenville-Fox\r\nministry, MR. PERCEVAL took the leading place in his Majesty's\r\nGovernment. He was a lawyer with a keen intellect, and a soul shriveled\r\nby the most limited views and bigoted prejudices. When ruling England,\r\nhe looked upon her position in reference to Continental affairs, and\r\nthe part she was to perform in the drama of nations, much as he was wont\r\nto regard the ten-pound case of a plaintiff whose brief and retainer he\r\nheld. He argued the great questions which nightly agitated the House of\r\nCommons, and whose decisions were to affect not only his own time, but\r\ncoming ages, like a mere lawyer struggling for a verdict. His weapon was\r\nsharp, and he applied its edge in the same way, whether analyzing the\r\ntitle of James Jackson to a ten-acre lot in Kent, or of Louis XVIII to\r\nthe throne of France. He discussed a financial scheme in Parliament to\r\nraise twenty millions sterling to carry on the war, just as he argued\r\nthe consideration of a twenty-pound note before a jury of Yorkshire\r\nplowmen. Yet he was a good tactician; saw a _point_ readily and clearly,\r\nthough he saw nothing but a point; knew how to touch the prejudices of\r\nbigots; was great at beating his opponents on small divisions; rarely\r\nlost his temper under the severest provocations; was quick at a turn and\r\nkeen at a retort; and spoke in a lively, colloquial, straight-forward\r\nstyle, which pleased the fat country gentlemen much better than the\r\nclassical allusions and ornate periods of Mr. Canning. He kept on the\r\neven tenor of his way till assassinated by a madman in the lobby of the\r\nHouse, in 1812.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the man who shaped the financial policy of England during\r\nsix of the most eventful years of her existence, and whom she permitted\r\nto plunge her into debt to the amount of L150,000,000! \"How could this\r\nbe?\" The answer is plain. Mr. Perceval stood firmly by the King and the\r\nBishops, flattering the prejudices of the one and the bigotry of the\r\nother; and never flinched from eulogizing royalty, when the rude hand of\r\npopular clamor drew the vail from the immoralities of the Prince Regent\r\nand his brother of York. Then he was a thorough business man; never\r\nalarmed \"Church and State\" by wandering, like Canning and Peel, out of\r\nthe beaten Tory track; and, so far from giving up a bad cause in the\r\nworst of times, he raised his voice the more sternly as the storm of\r\npublic discontent whistled louder, and cheered his flagging comrades to\r\ntheir daily round of degrading toil. Such a minister was fit to be\r\nbeloved by a bigoted king and his profligate heir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n     Pitt's Continental Policy--Mr. Tierney--Mr. Whitbread--Lord\r\n     Castlereagh--Lord Liverpool--Mr. Canning.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn examining a little further among the statesmen who opposed the\r\ncontinental policy of Mr. Pitt and his successors--though by no means\r\nintending to notice all who thus distinguished themselves--a less\r\nnotorious person than Mr. Sheridan attracts the eye; but one who, when\r\nwe regard the solid, every-day qualities of the mind, greatly surpassed\r\nthe showy blandishments of that celebrated orator. I allude to Mr.\r\nTierney. Like Mr. Perceval, he was bred to the bar; but unlike him, he\r\nwas not a mere lawyer, nor was his comprehension hemmed in by narrow\r\nprejudices, nor his soul shriveled by bigotry. Though his reputation in\r\nthis country is dim when compared with other luminaries that shone in\r\nthat Whig constellation in the dawn of the present century, yet it would\r\nbe difficult to name one who shed a more steady and useful light along\r\nthe path of the liberal party, during the first ten years of that\r\ncentury--always excepting Mr. Fox. Mr. Tierney was foremost among the\r\nreformers in the perilous times of the treason trials, in 1794--was a\r\nprominent member of the society of \"Friends of the People\"--penned the\r\nadmirable petition to Parliament, in which that association demonstrated\r\nthe necessity and safety of an enlarged suffrage, and an equal\r\nrepresentation--and, having attained a highly respectable standing at\r\nthe bar, entered Parliament in 1796, the year before Fox and the heads\r\nof the Opposition unwisely abandoned their attendance upon the House,\r\nbecause they despaired of arresting the course of Pitt. Mr. T. was at\r\nonce brought into a prominent position. He took up the gauntlet, and\r\nduring two or three sessions was the main leader of the remnant of the\r\nWhigs, who stood to their posts; and he showed himself competent to fill\r\nthe occasion thus opened to him. Night after night he headed the\r\ndiminished band, arraying the rigid reasoning powers and tireless\r\nbusiness habits which he brought from the bar, against the haughty\r\neloquence of Pitt and the dry arguments of Dundas, blunting the cold\r\nsarcasms of the former with his inimitable humor, and thrusting his keen\r\nanalytical weapon between the loose joints of the latter's logical\r\nharness. He was solicitor general of Mr. Addington's mixed\r\nadministration; but the dissolution of that compound soon relieved him\r\nfrom a cramped position, whence he gladly escaped to the broader field\r\nof untrammeled opposition. Here he did manful service in the popular\r\ncause, effectually blocking up all avenues to advancement, both in the\r\ncomparatively secluded walks of the profession which he ornamented, and\r\nthe more rugged and conspicuous paths of politics, which he delighted to\r\ntread. During a part of the dark night of the Continental Coalition, he\r\nguided the helm of his party with a skill and vigilance which its more\r\nrenowned chiefs might have profitably imitated. His ability to master\r\nthe details, as well as trace the outlines, of a complicated subject,\r\n(so essential to success at the bar,) induced his colleagues to devolve\r\nupon him the labor of exposing those exhausting schemes of finance by\r\nwhich Pitt and his successors drained the life-blood of England's\r\nprosperity, and swelled a debt which the sale of its every rood of soil\r\ncould hardly discharge. Thus he acquired a knowledge of trade and\r\nfinance, second only to that of the later Mr. Huskisson. It is meet that\r\nthe unassuming talents and services of such a man, \"faithful among the\r\nfaithless,\" should not be overlooked when naming the modern reformers of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of Mr. WHITBREAD. Some who have not looked into the\r\nParliamentary history of the times we are now glancing over, suppose him\r\nto have been merely a great brewer, purchasing an obscure seat in the\r\nHouse of Commons by his ill-gotten wealth, who held his tongue during\r\nthe session, and sold beer in vacation. But he possessed an intellect of\r\nthe most vigorous frame, which had been garnished by a complete\r\neducation, and liberalized by extensive foreign travel. He was the\r\ncompanion and counselor of Fox, Erskine, Sheridan, Grey, Mackintosh,\r\nRomilly, and Brougham--a frequent visitor at Holland House--a ready and\r\nstrong debater, always foremost in the conflicts of those violent\r\ntimes--for a short period the trusted leader of his party in the\r\nHouse--and in 1814, when the quarrel between the imprudent Caroline and\r\nher lewd husband came to an open rupture, he was selected, with\r\nBrougham, to be her confidential adviser and friend. Generous in the\r\ndiffusion of his vast wealth--gentle and kindly in his affections--the\r\nwarm friend of human freedom, and the sworn foe of oppression in all its\r\nforms--he gave his entire powers to the cause of progress and reform,\r\nand resisted, in all places, at all seasons, and when others quailed,\r\nthe foreign policy of Pitt, Perceval, and Castlereagh. The return of\r\nNapoleon from Elba alarmed all classes of Englishmen, and for the moment\r\nswept all parties from their moorings. An Address to the Throne for an\r\nenlargement of the forces was immediately moved by Grenville in the\r\nLords, and Grattan in the Commons, (both Whigs,) and supported by a\r\nlarge majority of the panic-struck Opposition. Whitbread stood firm;\r\nand, though denounced as a traitor and a French Jacobin, made an able\r\nspeech in favor of his motion that England ought not to interfere for\r\nthe restoration of the Bourbons. Such a fact illustrates the inflexible\r\nmetal of the man, more than a column of panegyric. His political\r\nprinciples approached the standard of democracy; and this, with his\r\nplebeian extraction and rather blunt manners, gave him less favor with\r\nsome of the full-blooded patricians of his party than with their common\r\nconstituency. He died in 1815, and like Romilly and Castlereagh, fell by\r\nhis own hand.\r\n\r\nMany worthy and not a few illustrious names might find a place here.\r\nGrey, the dignified and uncompromising--Romilly, the sagacious and\r\nhumane--Mackintosh, the classical and ornate--Grattan, the chivalrous\r\nand daring--Burdett, the manly and bold--Horner, the learned and\r\nmodest--Holland, the polished and generous--Brougham, the versatile and\r\nstrong--all of whom, with others scarcely less notable, sustained the\r\ndrooping cause of freedom against the policy of Pitt and his followers,\r\nand kept alive the sacred fires, to break out brightly in happier times.\r\nBut, each may be noticed in other connections. We will now speak of\r\nthree statesmen of a different school.\r\n\r\nLORD CASTLEREAGH was the life and soul of Pitt's continental policy\r\nduring the six years before Napoleon fell. Like Sheridan, he was an\r\nIrishman. But, unlike him, he resisted every measure which promised to\r\nbless his native country, with the skill of a magician and the venom of\r\na fiend. Ever ready to bribe, bully, or butcher, he plunged England\r\ndeeper and deeper into debt and into blood, and seemed to regret when\r\nthere was no more money to be squandered, and no more fighting to be\r\ndone. As the best atonement he could make for permitting her to come out\r\nof the conflict with a free Government, and without being utterly\r\nruined, he went to the Congress of Vienna, and humbly begged leave to\r\nlay her constitution and her honor at the feet of the allied despots\r\nwhom she had impoverished herself in sustaining against the arms of\r\nFrance. It has been contended that Perceval was an honest bigot; at\r\nleast as honest as any man could be who performed so many bad deeds.\r\nBut, beyond all question, Castlereagh is one of the most atrocious and\r\ndespicable Englishmen of the nineteenth century. The name of no other\r\nmodern statesman is so cordially and so justly detested by the mass of\r\nthe people. With no more eloquence than a last year's almanac--utterly\r\nincapable of cutting even a second-rate figure as a Parliamentary\r\ndebater--yet, because of his intimate acquaintance with the affairs of\r\nthat vast kingdom, his blunt sense, promptness in council, unflinching\r\ncourage, and his unfaltering attachment to the Throne, and his\r\nunscrupulous execution of its decrees, he led the Tory party in the\r\nCommons, and controlled the counsels of the King through eleven of the\r\nmost turbulent years in England's recent history. Though not the nominal\r\nPremier, he was the real head of its ministry during the war with this\r\ncountry, and in the times which preceded and followed the overthrow of\r\nBonaparte, and bore a leading share in the subsequent despotic\r\ntransactions which assumed the soft name of \"the pacification of\r\nEurope.\" At the Congress of Vienna he represented the Power which had\r\nstaked all, and nearly lost all, in restoring the Bourbons. This gave\r\nhim the right to demand, in her name, that the victories she had bought\r\nor won should redound to the advancement of constitutional liberty. But\r\nthis cringing tool of anointed tyranny, so far from bearing himself in a\r\nmanner worthy of his great constituency, succumbed to the dictation of\r\nRussia and Austria--aided them in forming the diabolical Holy Alliance,\r\nthat politico-military Inquisition for \"the settlement of Europe\"--and,\r\ndecked out in his blazing star and azure ribbon, seemed to take as\r\nvulgar a satisfaction in being permitted to sit at the council-board of\r\nthese monarchs, as did Mr. Tittlebat Titmouse, when admitted to the\r\ntable of the Earl of Dreddlington. His subsequent course in endorsing\r\nthe military _surveillance_ which this Holy Inquisition exercised over\r\nthe people of Europe, encountered the tireless hostility of the liberal\r\nparty of England, whose leaders made the island ring with their\r\nprotests. At length, this bold, bad man, this \"_ice-hearted dog_,\" as\r\nEbenezer Elliott called him, having opposed the abolition of the slave\r\ntrade, the amelioration of the criminal code, the modification of the\r\ncorn laws, Catholic emancipation, Parliamentary reform, and every other\r\nsocial and political improvement, during twenty-five years, suddenly\r\nfinished a career which had been marked at every step by infamous deeds.\r\nImmediately thereupon, Mr. Canning, who succeeded to his place as\r\nForeign Secretary, filed his protest against certain proceedings of the\r\nHoly Alliance, and England withdrew from that conspiracy of royal\r\nrogues.\r\n\r\nThroughout the period just mentioned, LORD LIVERPOOL was the nominal\r\nhead of the Ministry. He was a very respectable nobleman, with a large\r\npurse and few talents; an easy, good-for-nothing, James-Monroe sort of a\r\nbody, whom every Whig and Tory made a low bow to, but whom nobody feared\r\nor cared for; a pilot that could steer the ship of state tolerably well\r\nin quiet waters, but who quit the helm for the cabin the instant the sky\r\nwas overcast, or the waves raged. He was in office so long that he\r\nbecame a sort of ministerial fixture--a kind of nucleus around which\r\nmore ambitious, showy, and potent materials gathered. People had become\r\nso accustomed to see him at the head of affairs, where he did so little\r\nas to offend no one, that they looked upon him as almost as necessary to\r\nthe working of the governmental machine as the King himself. This\r\ncommonplace man, under the successive names of Mr. Jenkinson, Lord\r\nHawkesbury, and Lord Liverpool, held important stations in the Cabinet\r\nmore than thirty years, nearly half of which he was Premier.\r\n\r\nAs has been remarked, MR. CANNING succeeded Lord Castlereagh as Foreign\r\nSecretary in 1823, and Lord Liverpool as Premier in 1827. Like\r\nCastlereagh, Canning was of Irish descent; but, unlike him, he had some\r\nIrish blood in his veins. Like him, he sustained the continental policy\r\nof Pitt; but, unlike him, he did not desire to degrade England, after\r\nshe had destroyed Napoleon. Like him, he exercised great sway in the\r\ncouncils of the country; but, unlike him, it was not so much the\r\ninfluence of mere official station, as the voluntary tribute paid to a\r\nsplendid and captivating genius. For thirty-five years, this remarkable\r\nman participated in public affairs; and whatever opinion may be formed\r\nof his statesmenship, he was undoubtedly the most brilliant orator (I\r\nuse the term in its best and in its restricted sense) which has appeared\r\nin the House of Commons the present century.\r\n\r\nCanning's father was a broken-down Irish barrister, who, having little\r\nknowledge of law, and less practice, quit Ireland for London, where he\r\neked out a scanty existence by writing bad rhymes for the magazines, and\r\ntolerable pamphlets for the politicians. He died the day George was a\r\nyear old--April 11, 1771. The mother, left penniless, listened to the\r\nflatteries of Garrick, went upon the stage, tried to sustain first-rate\r\ncharacters, failed, sunk silently into a secondary position, married a\r\ndrunken actor, who then had two or three wives, and who, after strolling\r\nabout the provinces a few years, died in a mad-house, when she married a\r\nstage-smitten silk mercer, who had a little more money than her late\r\nhusband, and a rather better character. Failing in business soon after,\r\nhe tried the stage in company with his wife, where he speedily broke\r\ndown, and she continued for some years to figure in third-rate\r\ncharacters at the minor theaters. In such company as would naturally\r\nsurround such guardians, the future Prime Minister of England spent the\r\nfirst nine or ten years of his life. He had a respectable paternal uncle\r\nin London--a merchant of some wealth. An old actor, by the name of\r\nMoody, detected the glittering gem of genius in the unpromising lad,\r\nwent to this uncle, and urged him to take his nephew (whom he had never\r\nseen) under his care. He complied, sent him to a grammar school, then to\r\nEton, and, dying, left the means of educating his ward at Oxford. Young\r\nCanning shone conspicuously at the University, as a wit, an\r\nelocutionist, and a poet, and contracted some aristocratic friendships\r\nwhich served his turn in subsequent life, especially that with Mr.\r\nJenkinson, afterwards Lord Liverpool.\r\n\r\nAfter he left the University, he became intimate with Sheridan, who knew\r\nsomething of his mother and his own history, and by him was introduced\r\nto Fox and other leading Whigs. Though impregnated with liberal\r\nprinciples, his ambitious eye saw that Whigism was an obscured luminary,\r\nand so he turned and worshiped the ascendant star of Pitt. Entering\r\nParliament in 1793, just at the bursting of the continental storm, he at\r\nonce took his seat on the Treasury benches, and soon became a polished\r\nshaft in the quiver of the great anti-Gallican archer. In or out of\r\noffice, he followed the fortunes of Pitt and his successors, till he\r\nquarreled and fought a duel with Castlereagh, in 1809, when they both\r\nleft the Cabinet, and Canning remained under a cloud till 1814, when he\r\nwas banished as minister to the Court of Lisbon. From this time, he\r\nnever had the full confidence of the old school Tories, though he was\r\ntheir most brilliant advocate in Parliament, and generally shared office\r\nwith them, and sustained their measures. After Castlereagh died, Mr.\r\nCanning drew closely around him the more liberal Tories--such as Lords\r\nMelbourne, Palmerston, Glenelg--and made up, in conjunction with Mr.\r\nHuskisson, a \"third party,\" called \"Canningites,\" who, through the\r\nauspices of Brougham, in 1827, formed a _quasi_ coalition with the\r\nWhigs. After the death of their chief, many of his followers went\r\ncompletely over to the Whigs, aided Earl Grey in carrying the reform\r\nbill, took office under him, and subsequently, in an evil hour, became\r\nthe leaders of that party.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of giving a hearty support to the abolition of the\r\nslave trade, and advocating the cause of Catholic emancipation, Mr.\r\nCanning sustained the worst Tory measures from his entrance into\r\nParliament to the death of Castlereagh--a period of thirty\r\nyears--bringing to bear against the People's cause all the resources of\r\nhis classical learning, vivid wit, vigorous reasoning, captivating\r\nmanners, and unrivaled oratory. Undoubtedly, he despised the truckling\r\ncourse of Castlereagh towards the Holy Alliance; and, either because he\r\nwished to escape from \"a false position,\" or because his colleagues\r\ndesired to cripple his influence, he was just about to go out to India\r\nas Governor General, when the suicide of Castlereagh altered his\r\ndestination, and he exchanged a subordinate foreign station for the\r\nchief control of that department of affairs. Immediately, England took a\r\nnobler position toward the continental alliance in which she had been\r\nentangled by his wily predecessor. The new Secretary protested against\r\nthe interference of the Allied Sovereigns with the popular movements in\r\nSpain, and early the next year (1824) stated in his place that Ministers\r\nhad refused to become parties to another Congress. This was the longest\r\nstride toward progress for thirty years, and well might the House of\r\nCommons ring with enthusiastic plaudits. This was promptly followed by\r\nthe virtual recognition of the independence of the new South American\r\nRepublics--another blow at the Holy Military Inquisition. Calling Mr.\r\nRobinson to his aid as Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Mr. Huskisson as\r\nPresident of the Board of Trade, the reoerganized ministry (good, easy\r\nLord Liverpool being its nominal head) adopted a more liberal policy in\r\ncommerce and finance, which, coupled with its course in foreign affairs,\r\ndrew to it a large share of confidence in the middle classes, and\r\nsoftened the asperities of the Opposition. During the four years that\r\nCanning controlled Liverpool's ministry, taxes were reduced, several\r\nrestrictions removed from trade, the endless delays in chancery inquired\r\ninto, the death penalty curtailed, resolutions passed looking toward\r\nslave emancipation, the corn laws slightly modified, and a bill for the\r\nrelief of the Catholics was carried in the Commons, but thrown out by\r\nthe Lords. Liverpool died early in 1827. After a quarrel with Wellington\r\nand Peel, Canning, in May of that year, reached the culminating point of\r\nhis ambition, the Premiership of England. But, at the end of four months\r\nof vexed and troublesome rule, he died, much lamented by the people, who\r\nwere expecting good things from his administration.\r\n\r\nViewed from one point of observation, Mr. Canning's later policy was\r\nfavorable to the cause of reform; but, in another aspect, it may be\r\ndoubted whether his half-way measures were not, in the long run,\r\ndetrimental to that cause. He was raised up to save the Tory party, if\r\nthey would have consented to be saved by him; for, had he lived, he\r\nwould have continued gradually to yield to the advancing spirit of the\r\nage, and kept them in power many years. But their distrust of him after\r\nthe peace of 1815 crippled his genius, mortified his pride, and\r\ndetermined him in due time to rend the party which would not permit him\r\nto rule. Through the aid of his personal adherents, his \"third party,\"\r\nhe did for the Tories in 1826-7, what Peel did for them twenty years\r\nlater--yielded to liberal opinions--split the party in twain--and formed\r\na _quasi_ coalition with his ancient opponents. Though by this means\r\nsome measures, such as Catholic emancipation and Parliamentary reform,\r\nwere sooner carried (though only to a partial extent) than they\r\notherwise might have been, yet it is hardly to be doubted that the\r\nliberal cause is now more depressed than it would have been, had no such\r\ncoalition been formed and no such resulting concessions made. Though the\r\nsecession of the Canningites weakened the Tories, the accession diluted\r\nthe Whigs. It ultimately gave them such leaders as Melbourne and\r\nPalmerston--men who, down to 1828, had been among the most strenuous\r\nopponents of reform--men who have made Whigism popular at Court, by\r\narraying it in purple and fine linen, and other soft clothing--who have\r\nstripped it of its rugged aspect, and decked it in the high-bred airs\r\nwhich it wore in the days of the elder Georges and the Walpoles, when a\r\nfew noble families controlled its affairs. But, on the other hand, Mr.\r\nCanning broke the power of old-fashioned John Bull Toryism--the\r\nremorseless, insolent, _statu-quo_ Toryism of French revolutionary\r\ntimes--and introduced the more complying, civil, progressive Toryism,\r\nwhich emancipates Catholics and repeals corn laws.\r\n\r\nMr. Canning was like Mr. Fox in one respect. Each introduced a new era\r\nin his party. The aristocratic Whigism of the last century, to which I\r\nhave alluded, is graphically hit off by Brougham, when he says the heads\r\nof the few great families who controlled the party \"never could be made\r\nto understand how a feeble motion, prefaced by a feeble speech, if made\r\nby an elderly lord and seconded by a younger one, could fail to satisfy\r\nthe country and shake the Ministry!\" Fox, the Jefferson of English\r\nliberalism, opened the door for men without ancestry or wealth to enter\r\nthe party, and find the place to which their talents assigned them,\r\nwhether at its head or its foot. He introduced the Whigism of the type\r\nof Grey, Brougham, Romilly, Russell, and the Edinburgh Review. It has\r\nserved its day and generation, and has become so like modified,\r\n_Canningized_ Toryism, that the chief distinction between them is in the\r\ndifferent modes of spelling their names. Within the last twenty years,\r\nthe people of England have advanced a century, while the Whig leaders\r\nhave not kept pace even with the calendar. English liberalism looks with\r\nlonging eye for \"the coming man;\" and when he appears, he will be as far\r\nin advance of the Palmerstons and Russells of to-day, as they are before\r\nthe Pitts and the Percevals of past times.\r\n\r\nTo return to Mr. Canning. During the last five years of his life, he\r\noccupied a sort of middle-ground between the ancient and the modern\r\n_regime_; or, rather, was the connecting-link between the old and the\r\nnew order of things. Having served under Pitt in his youth, he formed an\r\nalliance with the disciples of Fox in his maturity. Having advocated the\r\ncomplete destruction of the Irish Parliament in 1799 and 1800, he\r\nproposed a qualified emancipation of its Catholics in 1823 and 1827.\r\nHaving sustained the European coalition for the overthrow of Napoleon,\r\nhe repudiated its legitimate offspring, the Holy Alliance. Having\r\ndrained England of her wealth to nourish and maintain absolutism on the\r\ncontinent, he shrunk from permitting her to pluck the fruit of her own\r\nculture. In these latter years, he might have been properly called\r\neither a liberal Tory or a Conservative Whig. He was the friend of\r\nCatholic emancipation; but though public sentiment was not ripe enough\r\nduring his administration to accomplish this reform, his efforts tended\r\nto bring it to that maturity which, soon after his death, enabled this\r\nproscribed sect to gather the fruit from that tree of religious\r\ntoleration which his hand had aided to plant in the breast of English\r\nProtestantism. But, on the vital subject of Parliamentary reform, he\r\nwould yield nothing. It was in reference to this that he had his famous\r\nquarrel with Brougham, who, by the bye, was for many years the pitted\r\nantagonist of Canning. The point in controversy was the disfranchisement\r\nof a rotten borough, which had been convicted of bribery. Both girded\r\nthemselves for the contest. Never was the rugged intensity of the one,\r\nnor the polished strength of the other, more conspicuous than on that\r\noccasion. Brougham's attack was compared to the concave _speculum_, in\r\nwhich every ray was concentrated with focal intensity, and poured in a\r\nburning stream upon his shrinking victim. Canning's, to the convex\r\nmirror, which scattered the rays, and showered them down upon his foe\r\nwith blinding fervor.\r\n\r\nTurning from the statesman to the orator, we find him occupying a place\r\nequaled by few of his cotemporaries; surpassed by none. He was the\r\nCicero of the British Senate; and, using the term _oratory_ in its\r\nprecise sense, he shines unrivaled among the English statesmen of our\r\nday. He is an admirable refutation of the somewhat popular error, that a\r\n_reasoner_ must necessarily be as dull and uninteresting as the Rev. Dr.\r\nDryasdust--that wit, raillery, vivid illustration, and suggestive\r\nallusions, are incompatible with sound argument--that to be convincing,\r\none must be stupid--that logic consists in a lifeless skeleton of\r\nconsecutive syllogisms, divested of the flesh, blood, and marrow of\r\neloquence--and that the profundity of a speech is to be measured by the\r\ndepth of the slumbers into which it precipitates the auditory. It is\r\nthus that many a man has gained the reputation of being a great\r\nreasoner, when he was only a great bore; or been accounted wiser than\r\nhis more vivacious associates, because he wore a stolid visage and held\r\nhis tongue--completely putting to rout the venerable maxim of \"nothing\r\nventure, nothing have.\"\r\n\r\nThough few public speakers of his time dealt more with the lighter\r\ngraces of oratory--wit, fancy, epigram, anecdote, historical\r\nillustration, and classical allusion--so, few excelled him in the\r\nclearness of his statements, the solidity of his arguments, and the\r\nskill with which he brought all his resources to bear upon the point to\r\nbe reached, and the power with which he pressed it home to the\r\nconviction of his hearers. A burst of laughter from all sides, excited\r\nby his infectious wit, or a round of applause from his friends when some\r\ngalling sarcasm pierced the mailed harness of the Opposition, relieved\r\nthe tedium of a currency debate, intolerably dull in most hands, but\r\nwhich he, by mingling figures of speech with the figures of the budget,\r\nalways made interesting, and thus kept his party in good humor while he\r\ndrove these wearisome topics through the thick skulls of knights of the\r\nshire and country squires, of which material the Tories were largely\r\nmade up. Throwing around the path where he led his auditors a profusion\r\nof flowers, gathered in all climes and refreshing to all tastes, he was\r\never carrying forward the heavy chain of argument, delighting while he\r\nconvinced, and amusing that he might convert.\r\n\r\nBut these rare qualities produced their drawbacks. So skillful a master\r\nof so bewitching an art could not be sparing in the exhibition of his\r\npeculiar powers. His pleasantry and by-play, when handling momentous\r\nquestions, offended graver men, who could not believe that so much\r\nlevity was consistent with sincerity. He excited the jealousy of plainer\r\nunderstandings, who saw things as clearly as he, but could not set them\r\nin so transparent a light. His coruscations were not only glittering,\r\nbut they often dazzled and confounded less ornate minds. His sarcasms\r\nstung his enemies to madness; and, not content merely to drive his\r\nopponents to the wall, he hurled them there with such force, that they\r\nrebounded into the arena, to become in turn the assailants; and his\r\nfriends found that a brilliant attack led on by him often resulted in a\r\ncounter assault, which summoned to the rescue all the forces of his\r\nparty. And more than this, his port and bearing left the impression upon\r\nmost minds that a consummate artist was acting a part, and not a sincere\r\nman speaking from the heart. His obscure origin, (obscure for one who\r\naspired to be a Tory Premier,) and his early coquetry with the Whigs,\r\naffixed to him the epithet of \"an adventurer;\" and he never shook off\r\nthe epithet, nor effaced the impression that it was fitly bestowed. The\r\npeople of England, whether he was Treasurer of the Navy, Foreign\r\nSecretary, Prime Minister, or Parliamentary orator, never wholly escaped\r\nfrom the suspicion that the son was following the profession of the\r\nmother, but had chosen the chapel of St. Stephen's rather than the\r\ntheater of Drury Lane, for the display of his genius.\r\n\r\nTurning from the orator to the man, we find much to delight the eye.\r\nGeorge Canning never forgot the humble mother that bore him. So soon as\r\nhis resources would permit, he made ample provision for her support; and\r\nfor years after he entered Parliament, and even when a foreign\r\nambassador, he wrote her a weekly epistle, breathing the kindliest\r\naffection. Though he could never elevate her tastes and associations\r\nabove the connections of her youth, he used to throw aside the cares of\r\noffice, that he might visit her, and the humble cousins with whom she\r\ndwelt, at Bath; and there, when in the zenith of his fame, would walk\r\nout with his plebeian relatives, and receive the homage of the lordly\r\nvisitants at that fashionable resort, in their company. This marks him a\r\nnoble man. He delighted in literary pursuits--would drop the pen when\r\npreparing a diplomatic dispatch, to talk over the classics with his\r\nuniversity acquaintances--was a brilliant essayist, and wrote Latin and\r\nEnglish verses with grace and beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n     Abolition of the African Slave Trade--Granville\r\n     Sharpe--Wilberforce--Pitt--Stephen--Macaulay--Brougham.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn tracing the foreign policy of Pitt, we have been led beyond the\r\nperiod of the great philanthropic achievement of 1806-7--the Abolition\r\nof the African Slave Trade. I shall not trace the origin and growth of\r\nthis traffic, nor describe its horrors, nor detail the measures, in and\r\nout of Parliament, which led to its legal prohibition. They are familiar\r\nto those who will be likely to read this chapter.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS CLARKSON was the father of the movement for the abolition of the\r\nslave trade, and, consequently, for the destruction of negro slavery\r\nitself, of which it is but an incident. The circumstances which turned\r\nhis attention to it are novel. In 1785, he was a senior bachelor of arts\r\nof St. John's College, Cambridge. The vice chancellor, impressed with\r\nthe iniquity of the slave trade, announced to the seniors as a subject\r\nfor a Latin dissertation, (I translate it,) \"Is it right to make slaves\r\nof others against their will?\" He little thought of the far-reaching\r\nconsequences of this proposal. Young Clarkson, having secured the Latin\r\nprize the previous year, was anxious to obtain it again. He went to\r\nLondon, and procured all the books relating to the subject he could\r\nfind. His sensitive mind was shocked beyond measure at the horrors of\r\n\"the middle passage,\" which they disclosed. Sleep often left his pillow,\r\nwhile digesting the materials for his essay; and during its preparation\r\nhe resolved to devote his life to the destruction of so appalling an\r\nevil. Noble resolution! Little did the young philanthropist then imagine\r\nthat he should live, not only to see this trade abolished by Great\r\nBritain, and declared piracy by all Christian Powers, but to witness the\r\nabolition of slavery itself in those islands of the West, around which\r\nhis warm sympathies clustered; that he should see the humanity of the\r\nworld roused in arms to put down the crime of chattelizing mankind; and\r\nshould himself, after a lapse of fifty-five years, preside, \"the\r\nobserved of all observers,\" in the metropolis of England, at a large\r\nConvention assembled from the four quarters of the globe, to devise\r\nmeans to achieve a final victory in this war upon the \"wild and guilty\r\nphantasy, that man can hold property in man.\" But, I anticipate.\r\nClarkson finished his essay, won the prize, and, true to his vow,\r\ncommenced, friendless and without resources, the work of abolition. He\r\ntranslated and enlarged his essay, and committing it to press, started\r\non a pilgrimage through the kingdom, in search of facts to illustrate\r\nthe character of the traffic, and friends to aid him in its destruction.\r\nA singular instance of his patient zeal may be stated. He was anxious to\r\nascertain whether slaves were _kidnapped_ by the traders in the interior\r\nof Africa. He was told by a gentleman, that about a year before, he had\r\nconversed with a common sailor, who had made several excursions up the\r\nAfrican rivers, in pursuit of slaves, and presumed he could inform him\r\non this subject. He knew not the sailor's name, nor his residence, nor\r\nwhere he sailed from, and could only say, that when he saw him he\r\nbelonged on board some man-of-war in ordinary. Clarkson started on the\r\nforlorn hope of finding this sailor. He successively visited Deptford,\r\nWoolwich, Chatham, Sheerness, Portsmouth, and Plymouth--boarding, during\r\nthe tour, which occupied several weeks, 317 ships, and examining several\r\nthousand persons. I give the result in his own words: \"At length, I\r\narrived at the place of my last hope, (Plymouth.) On my first day's\r\nexpedition I boarded forty vessels, but found no one who had been on the\r\ncoast of Africa in the slave trade. One or two had been there in King's\r\nships, but they had never been on shore. Things wore now drawing to a\r\nclose; and my heart began to beat. I was restless and uneasy during the\r\nnight. The next morning I felt agitated between the alternate pressure\r\nof hope and fear; and in this state I entered my boat. The fifty-seventh\r\nvessel I boarded was the Melampus frigate. One person belonging to it,\r\non examining him in the captain's cabin, said he had been two voyages to\r\nAfrica; and I had not long conversed with him before I found, to my\r\ninexpressible joy, that he was the man.\" This long-sought witness\r\nconfirmed his suspicions in regard to kidnapping. In 1786, Clarkson\r\npublished a tract, embodying a summary of the various information he had\r\nobtained, and in June 1787, organized, in London, the first committee\r\nfor the abolition of the slave trade, and was appointed its secretary\r\nand agent. When visiting this patriarch of humanity, at Playford Hall,\r\nin 1840, he showed me the records of this committee. There were the\r\noriginal entries, in his own handwriting, made more than fifty-three\r\nyears before; and he was alive to read them to me, accompanied by many\r\nlively anecdotes of the early friends whose names and deeds were there\r\nrecorded. In 1787, he had his first interview with Mr. Wilberforce, and\r\nfound a ready access to the heart of that great and good man. In 1788,\r\nhe published his important work, \"The Impolicy of the Slave Trade.\" The\r\nnext year he visited France, to enlist the friends of liberty in that\r\ncountry in favor of his scheme. He had interviews with Mirabeau, Neckar,\r\nand others. He was denounced as a spy, and came near being seized. Owing\r\nto the revolutionary storm then rising over the kingdom, he accomplished\r\nlittle by this tour, except to present copies of his printed works to\r\nthe King, and obtain promises from Mirabeau and Neckar to call public\r\nattention to the subject when the agitations of the period had subsided.\r\nThese promises were soon engulfed in the earthquake which shook, not\r\nonly France, but Europe to its center.\r\n\r\nPrevious to 1788, such progress had been made in public sentiment and\r\nfeeling in England, through the indefatigable labors of Clarkson and the\r\ncommittee he had founded, that it was determined to bring the subject of\r\nAbolition before Parliament. Mr. Wilberforce was selected to open the\r\nquestion; but, owing to his ill health, Mr. Pitt, on the 9th of May,\r\n1788, moved that the House do resolve to take into consideration the\r\nstate of the slave trade early in the next session. In 1790, Wilberforce\r\nintroduced a proposition for the total abolition of the traffic, and\r\nsustained it with eminent ability, Pitt, Fox, and Burke giving him their\r\nsupport. The West India interest took fire, insisting that the trade was\r\nsanctioned by the Bible, and its abolition would ruin the commerce of\r\nLondon, Bristol, Liverpool, and other large marts. The session of 1792\r\nsaw the tables of both Houses loaded with influential petitions.\r\nWilberforce led off, as usual, followed closely by Fox and Pitt. Dundas,\r\n\"the right hand of Pitt,\" opposed the measure, and was scathed by Fox in\r\nreply. In the Lords, the Duke of Clarence denounced Wilberforce as a\r\n\"meddling fanatic,\" who ought to be expelled from Parliament. But the\r\nobject of his censure lived to see his royal traducer, as King William\r\nIV, sign a bill appropriating L20,000,000 for the abolition of slavery\r\nin the West India islands! Omitting details, suffice it to say, that the\r\nfriends of Abolition pressed its consideration upon the public attention\r\nfrom year to year, with increasing fervor, Clarkson being the out-door\r\nmanager, and Wilberforce the Parliamentary, (always sustained by Pitt\r\nand Fox,) till, on the downfall of Pitt, and the coming in of a liberal\r\nadministration, with Fox for its leader, in 1806, a condemnatory vote\r\nwas obtained, which, in the next year, was followed by the total\r\nabolition of the trade.\r\n\r\nI will not stop to state why this measure, since adopted from time to\r\ntime by all Christian nations, has not fulfilled the expectations of its\r\nfriends; nor why the number of victims of the slave trade in our day is\r\ndouble that of the time when Clarkson commenced his labors. In a word,\r\nso long as the existence of slavery makes a demand for fresh \"cargoes of\r\nhuman agony,\" so long wretches will be found to brave heaven, earth, and\r\nhell, to furnish the supply. But the failure to attain complete success\r\nshould not lessen our admiration of those early toils, which, like an\r\noasis in the wide desert of human selfishness, refresh the eye of all\r\nwho recognize the common brotherhood of man.\r\n\r\nMr. Clarkson was greatly aided in his labors by GRANVILLE SHARPE. This\r\nsingular person had already become known for his advocacy of the rights\r\nof negro slaves when Clarkson commenced his work. He was born of humble\r\nparents, in 1735. He had a mind peculiarly fond of probing everything to\r\nthe bottom. While an apprentice, a controversy with a Socinian led him\r\nto study Greek, that he might read the New Testament in the original. A\r\ndispute with a Jew induced him to obtain a knowledge of Hebrew. In 1767,\r\nhis interference in behalf of a West India slave, whose master, then in\r\nLondon, had whipped him nearly to death, cost him a lawsuit. He must be\r\nbeaten, if the master could hold his slave in England. Eminent counsel\r\ntold him he must fail, for the right of the master was not invalidated\r\nby bringing his slave to England. Repudiating this advice, Sharpe, with\r\nhis usual diligence and bent of mind, devoted himself to the study of\r\nthe law, preparatory to his own defense. The \"law's delay\" gave him\r\nample time to explore the subject to its foundations. He published a\r\ntract \"On the injustice and dangerous tendency of tolerating slavery, or\r\neven of admitting the least claim to property in the persons of men, in\r\nEngland.\" His rare authorities and profound reasoning converted to his\r\nviews many leading members of the bar. After a delay of two years, the\r\nplaintiff abandoned the case, paying Sharpe heavy costs. While further\r\nprosecuting his legal researches, he had another affair of a similar\r\nkind, in which he was partially successful. By this time, though\r\ncomparatively an obscure man, he was better read in the law of slavery,\r\nand the restrictions upon the system in England, than any barrister or\r\njurist in Westminster Hall. In 1772 came on the hearing, before Lord\r\nMansfield, in the matter of the negro Somersett, a West India slave, who\r\nclaimed his freedom on the ground that his master had brought him into\r\nEngland. The ablest counsel were employed on both sides; the case was\r\nargued twice or thrice, and was under consideration several months.\r\nSharpe took deep interest in the issue, frequently conferred with\r\nSomersett's counsel, and wrote in his behalf for the newspapers. At\r\nlength, on the 22d of June, 1772, Mansfield, with great reluctance, (for\r\nhe leaned to the side of the slaveholder,) pronounced the celebrated\r\njudgment, that slavery, being contrary to natural law, was of so odious\r\na nature that nothing but positive law could support it, and that every\r\nslave, on touching English soil, became free, and \"therefore the man\r\nmust be discharged!\" This rule has ever since been recognized as law in\r\nall climes where England bears sway, and is so regarded in America and\r\nmost of the civilized States of the world. For three-fourths of a\r\ncentury it has pursued the Evil Spirit of slavery with uplifted weapon,\r\nready to cleave it to the earth the moment it passed the boundaries of\r\nits own odious and unnatural law; and in our day it stands like the\r\nflaming sword of Paradise, turning every way, to guard the tree of\r\nLiberty. For the early announcement of this far-reaching and\r\ndeep-sounding principle, the world is indebted to the labors of one who\r\ncommenced his career as a humble London apprentice. Having fought the\r\ngood fight of Abolition with Clarkson and Wilberforce, and gained\r\nconsiderable distinction by his philanthropic deeds and writings,\r\nnumbering Sir William Jones among his intimate friends, he died in 1813.\r\nA monument, with suitable devices and inscriptions, was erected to his\r\nmemory in the Poet's Corner of Westminster Abbey, to mark the public\r\nsense of his merits.\r\n\r\nMR. WILBERFORCE has not been over-estimated, but, in my judgment, he\r\nhas been mis-estimated. Entitled to less relative praise for his\r\nAbolition services than is generally bestowed, he is worthy of a higher\r\nposition as a statesman and orator than is usually assigned to him. This\r\ncommon error is readily accounted for. The commanding place he so long\r\noccupied, as the Parliamentary leader in this Reform, rendered him more\r\nconspicuous at home, and especially abroad, than any of his coadjutors,\r\nthough no man was more ready than he to acknowledge that his services\r\nwere meager, compared with those of some of his less noted colaborers.\r\nSo, on the other hand, such is the luster of Mr. Wilberforce's undoubted\r\nachievements in the Abolition cause, that to the public eye they have\r\nthrown into the shade his very superior talents in other and more\r\ngeneral aspects. He would have stood in the front rank of Parliamentary\r\norators, (and those were the days of Burke, Fox, Pitt, Erskine, Wyndham,\r\nand Sheridan,) had he never thrown a halo round his name by consecrating\r\nhis powers to humanity. Thoroughly educated, and furnished with general\r\ninformation, his eloquence was of a high order--fervid, instructive,\r\npersuasive; his diction classical and elegant; his voice musical and\r\nbland; and though his figure was diminutive, and not graceful, his\r\ncountenance was remarkably expressive. He possessed a lively\r\nimagination, a keen sense of the ludicrous, a ready wit, and powers of\r\nsarcasm which Pitt might envy. These latter, however, he kept in\r\nsubjection, mainly from his strong religious susceptibilities and kindly\r\nspirit, which impelled him to avoid giving pain, choosing to disarm\r\npersonal assailants by winning appeals to their calmer judgments. On one\r\noccasion, after being repeatedly and coarsely alluded to, as \"the\r\nhonorable and very religious member,\" he turned upon his antagonist, and\r\npoured upon him a torrent of contempt, sarcasm, and rebuke, which\r\nastonished the House, not more for the ability it displayed, than that\r\nso great a master of indignant declamation should so rarely resort to\r\nits use. These intellectual elements combined with the spotless purity\r\nand winning beauty of his character, to give him great weight in the\r\nHouse, and contributed not a little to sustain the general policy of Mr.\r\nPitt, whose supporter he usually was, though he ever maintained a\r\nposition of comparative political independence. He had much personal\r\ninfluence over that minister, whose repeated offers to take office under\r\nhis Administration he steadily declined. He retired from Parliament in\r\n1824. His last public appearance was in 1830, when, on motion of his old\r\nfriend Clarkson, he took the chair at a large meeting of delegates, in\r\nLondon, assembled to promote the abolition of slavery in the West\r\nIndies.\r\n\r\nMR. PITT'S advocacy of Abolition is now believed to have been\r\nhollow-hearted--a mere trick to gain popular applause in unwonted\r\nquarters, and retain his hold upon Wilberforce. During the twenty years\r\nwhich this question agitated Parliament and the country, Pitt, with the\r\nexception of two or three, reigned supreme, and never failed to carry\r\nany scheme he set his heart upon. At the wave of his hand, he could have\r\ndriven from the House half the members, who steadily voted against\r\nAbolition, whilst with a dash of his pen he could have swept from the\r\noffices of the kingdom every occupant who dared oppose his will on this\r\nmeasure. By his personal advocacy of it, he lost nothing, and gained\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nWe turn with more pleasure to contemplate for a moment the services of\r\ntwo very different coadjutors of Wilberforce and Clarkson--James Stephen\r\nand Zachary Macaulay. It has already been said that the more imposing\r\ncharacter of Mr. Wilberforce's services threw into the shade those of\r\nmany not less worthy colaborers. Of these, Messrs. Stephen and Macaulay\r\nwere among the most eminent.\r\n\r\nMR. STEPHEN was a barrister. On being called to the bar, he emigrated to\r\nSt. Kitts, and attained such distinction in the colonial courts as to be\r\ncalled \"the Erskine of the West Indies.\" Impaired health induced his\r\nreturn to England in 1794, where he urged his way to a respectable\r\nstanding in Westminster Hall. Soon after his return, he procured an\r\nintroduction to Wilberforce, and immediately entered, with\r\ncharacteristic zeal, into the great work to which the former had devoted\r\nhis powers. He was prepared for this from the fact, that such was his\r\nabhorrence of slavery, that he never owned a slave during his protracted\r\nresidence in the West Indies. He subsequently married the sister of Mr.\r\nWilberforce. He consecrated his vigorous pen to the cause of Abolition,\r\nand contributed much to create that public sentiment which demanded the\r\nabrogation of the traffic. At the solicitation of Mr. Perceval, he\r\nentered Parliament in 1808, where he remained seven or eight years.\r\nAlways conscientious in the discharge of his political duties, he\r\nrefused to support the administration which followed that of Perceval,\r\nin consequence of their neglect to promote a measure, which he had\r\nanxiously pressed upon them, for the registration of slaves in the West\r\nIndies. He soon after resigned his seat, and devoted himself more\r\nexclusively to the duties of a master in chancery, to which office he\r\nhad been appointed in 1811, and which he held twenty years. He was the\r\nmeans of introducing several reforms in the practice of the court of\r\nchancery, though by so doing he essentially lessened his own emoluments.\r\nAs an instance of his disinterestedness, it may be mentioned that he\r\nforbade his clerk to take the ordinary gratuities, and remunerated him\r\nfor his loss out of his own pocket to the amount of about L800 a year.\r\nWhat time he could spare from his official duties was devoted to the\r\nabolition of the slave trade by foreign States, and of slavery in the\r\nWest Indies. Besides numerous pamphlets, occasional speeches, and an\r\nextensive correspondence on these subjects, he published an admirable\r\nlegal work, entitled, \"Slavery of the British West India Colonies\r\nDelineated,\" the plan of which has apparently been followed by Judge\r\nStroud, of Philadelphia, in a work of equal ability, on American\r\nslavery. Mr. Stephen descended to his honored grave in 1832, at the\r\nadvanced age of 75.\r\n\r\nMR. MACAULAY is the father of the brilliant essayist and historian whose\r\nwritings are so well known in this country. And it is high praise to say\r\nthat, as a writer, he is the worthy progenitor of such a descendant;\r\nfor, though his publications fall short in beauty and splendor of those\r\nof his celebrated son, they are equal to his in logical acumen and\r\nargumentative power. Though younger in years than Stephen, Macaulay's\r\nservices in the abolition of the slave trade were equal to his, while\r\nthose in the cause of West India emancipation far transcended his.\r\n\r\nThe Life of Wilberforce, published by his sons, in 1838, was thought to\r\nhave done injustice to the early labors of Clarkson in the abolition of\r\nthe slave trade. An unpleasant controversy at once arose, as to the\r\nrelative merits of these philanthropists, and especially in reference to\r\ntheir agency in promoting the abolition. An anecdote was told to me in\r\nLondon respecting the matter, which illustrates one of the\r\nidiosyncrasies in the mental constitution of another early and steadfast\r\nAbolitionist--HENRY BROUGHAM--who, though young at the period of the\r\nabolition, had, while traveling on the continent, assisted Wilberforce\r\nby pursuing various inquiries in Holland, Germany, Poland, and other\r\ncountries, in regard to the traffic. Some of the particulars of the\r\nstory are forgotten, but enough are remembered for the present purpose.\r\nSoon after the appearance of the Life, the friends of Clarkson caused a\r\nbook to be prepared, vindicating his services and claims, to which\r\nBrougham agreed to furnish an introduction. The body of the work was in\r\npress before the ex-chancellor, pressed with multifarious labors, had\r\nprepared his paper. The committee having the matter in charge waited\r\nupon him, and stated that the publication was delayed for want of his\r\nintroduction; that country booksellers and anti-slavery societies were\r\nimpatient to have their orders filled, &c. Brougham told them he had not\r\nwritten a line of it, but would have it completed by a given day of the\r\nsame week. At the appointed time the committee called, and he read the\r\npaper. What was their mortification to find incorporated into the middle\r\nof it a ferocious attack on Daniel O'Connell, the very man upon whom\r\nthey were relying to help carry through the Commons the bill then\r\npending for the abolition of the apprenticeship in the West Indies, and\r\nwith whom they had had an interview on the subject that very morning.\r\nHere was a dilemma! They expostulated with Brougham; explained the\r\nruinous consequences to the cause, of their sanctioning such an attack\r\non O'Connell; and while they did not wish to interfere with the\r\ncontroversy between him and O'Connell, assured him that for them to\r\nissue such a publication at that crisis might seal the fate of the\r\napprenticeship bill--nor could they send out the work without his\r\nintroduction, without disappointing the public. After rather an exciting\r\ninterview, Brougham dismissed them by peremptorily declaring, \"they must\r\ntake it as it was, or not at all.\" They left in despair. The next day,\r\none of the committee called, to see if something could not be done to\r\nget over the difficulty, when lo, his lordship handed him the paper with\r\nthe offensive passage omitted. The secret of the alteration was this:\r\nThe night after the first interview, Brougham went down to the House of\r\nPeers, and \"pitching into\" the debate, castigated some half dozen of the\r\nlords spiritual and temporal to his heart's content, and, having thus\r\nworked off \"the slough of his passion,\" returned home in a calmer mood,\r\nand blotted the obnoxious paragraph from his Introduction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n     Law Reform--Jeremy Bentham--His Opinion of the Common Law--His\r\n     \"Felicity\" Principle--His Universal Code--His Works--The Fruits of\r\n     his Labors--His Talents and Character.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe father of Modern Law Reform was JEREMY BENTHAM. This singular person\r\nhas been often sneered at by Americans, who knew nothing of him or his\r\nwritings, except that he lived somewhere in Europe, and was called \"a\r\nvisionary foreign philosopher\" by the North American Review. He was the\r\nconstant theme of ridicule for a large class of Englishmen, who only\r\ncared to know that he was said to be an eccentric old man, who shunned\r\nthe world, admitted his guests to dine one at a time, wore an uncouth\r\ngarb, was an abominable sloven, turned wooden bowls on a lathe and run\r\nin his garden for exercise, relieved the tedium of study by playing now\r\non a fiddle and then on an organ, heated his house by steam, slept in a\r\nsack, looked very much like Ben. Franklin, did not believe in rotten\r\nboroughs or rotten creeds, did believe in free trade in corn and money,\r\nthought the common law the perfection of absurdity, Lord Eldon's court a\r\nlibel on equity, and wrote codes for all creation to use in the\r\ntwenty-ninth century.\r\n\r\nMr. Bentham was one of the most remarkable men that has appeared in our\r\nage. He was born in 1747, and was descended from a race of attorneys. At\r\nthe age of five, the family called him \"the philosopher;\" at eight he\r\nplayed well on the violin, on which he afterwards became a proficient;\r\nand at thirteen went to Oxford, where he excited admiration and wonder\r\nby his acute observations, logical skill, and precision of language.\r\nWhen he took his degree, he was esteemed the first reasoner and\r\nphilosophical critic in the University. He was at Oxford when Wesley and\r\nthe \"Methodists\" were expelled, and his generous soul took up arms\r\nagainst this tyranny. This induced him to examine the thirty-nine\r\narticles of the Church, one by one; and when it became necessary for him\r\nto subscribe them, long was the struggle before Bentham could bring his\r\nhand to do it. He has left on record a rebuke of this test, which ought\r\nto consign it to universal condemnation. At Oxford, he attended the law\r\nlectures of Blackstone, (being the substance of his Commentaries,) and\r\nhis clear mind detected the fallacies in his reasoning, and his humane\r\nand honest spirit revolted at many of his eulogiums on the Common Law of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe Bar, to which he was admitted in 1772, opened a brilliant prospect\r\nbefore him. His precise and acute method of drafting equity and law\r\npleadings was much extolled, and his refusal to receive the usual fees\r\nexcited no less attention. A sharp solicitor swelled a swindling bill of\r\ncosts in a case in which Bentham had succeeded--he protested--\"Quirk\"\r\ntold him it was made up according to the rules, and he would lose caste\r\nif he altered it. Bentham was disgusted, resolved to quit the\r\nprofession, and spend his life in \"endeavoring,\" as he expressed it, \"to\r\nput an end to the system, rather than profit by it.\" To the grasping\r\npertinacity of this solicitor, the world is indebted for the sixty\r\nyears' labor of Jeremy Bentham in the cause of law reform. Soon after\r\nthis, he published his first work, \"A Fragment on Government; being an\r\nexamination of what is delivered on that subject in Blackstone's\r\nCommentaries.\" He then visited Paris, where he became intimate with\r\nBrissot, through whose agency, and without his knowledge, he was\r\nsubsequently made a citizen of the French Republic, and elected a member\r\nof the second National Assembly.\r\n\r\nHis father died in 1792, leaving him a moderate fortune, which enabled\r\nhim entirely to abandon his profession, and devote himself to the\r\npreparation of those works on Law and Government which have celebrated\r\nhis name in the Four Quarters of the Globe. During the truce of Amiens,\r\nhe again visited Paris, accompanied by Sir Samuel Romilly, where he\r\nfound himself famous. M. Dumont was then publishing his works in French.\r\nOf his \"_Traites de Legislation Civile et Penale_,\" in 3 vols., about\r\n4,000 copies were sold in Paris. At this time, there happened to be\r\nthree vacancies in the French Institute, one of which was reserved for\r\nBonaparte. Bentham was chosen to fill one of the vacancies. From\r\nelective affinity, no less than through the agency of Romilly, he soon\r\nafter became intimate with the young men, known as \"the Edinburgh\r\nReviewers,\" Brougham, Jeffrey, Smith, Horner, Mackintosh, and their\r\nassociates, and from that time was the Mentor of that galaxy of talent\r\non the subject of Law Reform.\r\n\r\nWhen Bentham was admitted to the bar, he found the English law, its\r\nprinciples and its practice, entrenched behind the interests of powerful\r\nclasses, and embedded in the prejudices of all. Though called the\r\nperfection of reason, to his penetrating eye it was the offspring of a\r\nbarbarous age, and, though a noble production for the times that gave it\r\nbirth, had obtruded into the light of an infinitely milder and more\r\nliberal civilization the harsh features which stamped its origin. To him\r\nit was the patchwork of fifteen centuries--a chaos of good and evil--an\r\nedifice exhibiting the architecture of the ancient Briton, the Gaul, the\r\nGoth, the Dane, the Saxon, and the Norman, all jumbled together, and to\r\nwhich, in order to render it tenantable, modern hands had made numerous\r\nadditions and improvements, till the whole had become a huge, shapeless,\r\nand bewildering pile. He saw that it contained masses of material to aid\r\nin the erection of a new edifice, adapted to the enlarged wants and\r\ncultivated tastes of the present age. And he entered upon the\r\nelucidation of his plans for a judicial structure worthy of the noon of\r\nthe nineteenth century. He was the first man who sat down to the task of\r\nexposing the defects of the English law. Heretofore, its students and\r\nministers had been content to sift its principles from a chaotic mass of\r\nstatutes and decisions, and collect and arrange the perplexing details\r\nof its form of procedure. Commencing at the bottom, he worked up through\r\nall its ramifications, bringing everything to the test of expediency,\r\nand inquiring whether the parts were homogeneous with the whole, and\r\nwhether the whole was suited to the wants of existing society, and the\r\npromotion of human well-being. Probably not intending, when he started,\r\nto do more than improve the system by amending it, he soon aimed at its\r\ncomplete reconstruction, branching out into an exhausting discussion of\r\nthe principles on which all human laws should be based, nor stopping\r\ntill he had surveyed the nature of Government in its widest relations.\r\n\r\nThe test-principle of his system may be explained briefly thus: The only\r\nproper end of the social union is, the attainment of the maximum of the\r\naggregate of happiness; and the attainment of this maximum of the\r\naggregate of happiness is by the attainment of the maximum of individual\r\nhappiness. The standard for determining whether a law is right or wrong,\r\nis its conduciveness to the maximum of the aggregate of happiness, by\r\nconducing to the maximum of individual happiness. This was known in his\r\nday, and in ours, as \"the greatest-happiness principle,\" or \"the\r\nprinciple of felicity\"--which latter term he much preferred to that by\r\nwhich it is more commonly known, \"the doctrine of utility.\" This was the\r\nkeystone of Bentham's system. With this principle in his hand, he\r\ntraversed the entire field of legislation, dividing it into two great\r\nparts--internal law, and international law. Internal law included the\r\nlegislation which concerns a single State or community; international,\r\nthat which regulates the intercourse of different States with each\r\nother. His chief attention was devoted to preparing a code of internal\r\nlaw under the Greek name of _Pannomion_, (the whole law.) This he\r\ndivided into four parts--the constitutional, the civil, the penal, and\r\nthe administrative. The _constitutional_ defined the supreme authority,\r\nand the mode of executing its will. The _civil_ defined the rights of\r\npersons and of property, and was termed the \"right-conferring code.\" The\r\n_penal_ defined offenses and their punishments, and was termed \"the\r\nwrong-repressing code.\" The _administrative_ defined the mode of\r\nexecuting the whole body of the laws, and was termed \"the code of\r\nprocedure.\" Some of these codes he run out into details. Others he left\r\nunfinished. They all bore the stamp of great research, learning, and\r\nsymmetry, and were supported by vigorous reasoning, and elucidated by a\r\ncomprehensive genius. Many a _codifier_ of our day has been indebted,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, to these labors of Jeremy Bentham, to an extent\r\nof which he was perhaps not aware.\r\n\r\nHis system struck at the very root of the English law. Of course, such a\r\n\"wild enthusiast,\" such a \"reckless innovator,\" was laughed at,\r\nmisrepresented, and abused. Not a single tile or crumbling pillar of\r\n\"the perfection of reason\" must be touched. The rubbish that blocked up\r\nthe avenues leading to it, the dust which choked its passages, must not\r\nbe removed. Venerable for its age, hallowed as the legacy of our\r\nancestors, the work of wise men and dead men, it must be worshiped at a\r\ndistance and let alone. All classes deified it, and denounced such as\r\nwould sneeze at its consecrated dust. The king as he placed the golden\r\nround on his anointed head, and the noble as he gazed on his stars and\r\nribbons--the fat bishop as he pocketed his tithes, and the lean\r\ndissenter as he paid them--the judge in his scarlet robes, and the\r\nbarrister in his wig of horsehair--the merchant as he paid his onerous\r\nduties to the government, and the yeoman as he liquidated the ruinous\r\nrents of his landlord--the clodhopper as he took his shilling for twelve\r\nhours of exhausting toil, and the culprit as he hung on a cross-tree for\r\nkilling the hare which poached on his beans--all, high-born and\r\nlow-born, patrician and plebeian, rich and poor, wise and foolish, were\r\nready to make oath that the common law of England was the perfection of\r\nreason, and to swear at Jeremy Bentham for doubting it. If Bentham had\r\ndone nothing more than dispel this delusion, he would deserve the thanks\r\nof the millions in both hemispheres who submit to the sway of the common\r\nlaw; and this he did most effectually.\r\n\r\nBentham brought to his work reasoning faculties which did not so much\r\nprobe subjects to the bottom as begin there, and work upwards to their\r\nsurface--a patience which no amount of drudgery could weary--a taste\r\nwhose light reading was Bacon and Beccaria--a memory retentive as\r\ntablets of brass--a boldness which shrunk from looking no institution in\r\nthe face, and questioning its pretensions to utility and its claims to\r\nhomage--an honesty which never averted the eye from conclusions\r\nlegitimately born of sound premises--a conscience which followed truth\r\nwherever it led. Lord Brougham, who knew him intimately, has happily\r\nsaid: \"In him were blended, to a degree perhaps unequaled in any other\r\nphilosopher, the love and appreciation of general principles, with the\r\navidity for minute details; the power of embracing and following out\r\ngeneral views, with the capacity for pursuing each one of numberless\r\nparticular facts.\" He was an adept in numerous modern languages, as\r\nFrench, Italian, Spanish, and German, and he extended his linguistical\r\nknowledge into the Swedish, Russian, and other northern tongues. These\r\nacquisitions facilitated his study of the history of all countries and\r\ntimes, with whose philosophy, legislation and jurisprudence he was\r\nacquainted beyond most men.\r\n\r\nHis numerous writings all bore some relation to his \"Felicity\"\r\nprinciple, and the topics discussed were almost as multifarious as human\r\nexigency and action. Including his larger pamphlets, they must number\r\nsome fifty volumes. They chiefly relate to Government, law, and\r\njurisprudence; but he also wrote extensively on morals, politics, and\r\necclesiastical establishments. Nor did science wholly escape his\r\nsearching pen, for he treated of chemistry and anatomy. He wrote against\r\nBlackstone's Commentaries, and attacked Burke's plan for economical\r\nreform. He wrote on prison discipline and penal colonies, and\r\nillustrated the anti-Christian tendency of oaths. He advocated free\r\nschools, and denounced church establishments. He attacked rotten\r\nboroughs, and drafted plans for work-houses. He vindicated free trade,\r\nand showed the impolicy of the usury laws. He prepared a constitutional\r\ncode to be used by any State, and drew up a reform bill for the House of\r\nCommons. He wrote separate volumes or pamphlets on bankruptcy, poor\r\nlaws, primogeniture, escheats, taxation, jails, Scotch reform, the\r\nFrench judiciary, the criminal code of Spain, juries, evidence, rewards\r\nand punishments, oaths, parliamentary law, English reform, education,\r\nChurch-of-Englandism, &c., &c., &c. He wrote for or offered codes to\r\nFrance, Spain, Greece, Russia, and the South American States--sent a\r\nletter to each Governor of the United States, proposing to prepare for\r\nthem an entire code of laws--was intimate personally or by\r\ncorrespondence with Howard, Lafayette, Wilberforce, the Emperor\r\nAlexander, Napoleon, Brissot, Mirabeau, Neckar, Benezet, Franklin,\r\nJefferson, Bolivar, Jean Baptiste Say, Toussaint L'Ouverture, and in\r\nfact with most of the men of his times, who were celebrated in any part\r\nof the world for their services in the cause of liberty, humanity and\r\nreform.\r\n\r\nOf course no man, unless endowed with all the wisdom of the ancients and\r\nthe moderns, could write so much on such a variety of subjects, without\r\ncommitting to paper a good deal of nonsense. Yet he wrote no page but\r\ncontains some profound thoughts, whilst many of his volumes are replete\r\nwith wisdom. And if any one mortal man could have written codes for all\r\nthe nations on earth, that man was Jeremy Bentham.\r\n\r\nHis defects were partly the result of his peculiar mind, and partly of\r\nthose idiosyncrasies which germinate in all speculators who mingle\r\nlittle with men and things. Bold and original to a fault, he rather\r\nsuspected that an old thing was necessarily a bad thing. His exhaustless\r\npatience, and fondness for abstractions and theorizing, which grew by\r\nwhat they fed on, led him to carry everything out, out, out, till he\r\nsometimes trenched on absurdity or sunk in obscurity. In vulgar phrase,\r\nhe was prone to \"run a thing into the ground.\" He mixed so little with\r\nthe world, and had such limited experience in the every-day business of\r\nlife, that he often forgot that his codes must be executed by and upon\r\nmortal men. He lived fifty years in the house immortalized as the\r\ndwelling-place of Milton, in the very heart of London; and yet\r\nnine-tenths of the inhabitants, about whom he was thinking, and writing,\r\nand printing for half a century, never knew that he lived at all. Habits\r\ninduced by this recluse life, were not improved by his being the head\r\nand oracle of a school, whose immoderate puffings, which he must hear,\r\nwere not counterbalanced by denunciations from without, to which he\r\nnever listened. He tried to reduce everything to a system, and wrote as\r\nif the human mind were a curious little wheel, to be put into a vast\r\nengine, which, when regulated according to his system, would run without\r\njarring or friction. He made too little allowance for the\r\nindividualities, eccentricities, _crooked-stickednesses_ of mankind. But\r\nin this he did not differ from many other philosophers--men wiser and\r\nbetter than their generation--men so far beyond and above their times,\r\nthat they look like dwarfs to their cotemporaries.\r\n\r\nThen, he undertook so much that he left a great deal incomplete; so\r\nthat, in many of his works, while he has finished one side of a subject,\r\nhe seems not to have touched or seen the other side. His style,\r\nespecially in his latter years, was rough, involved, uncongenial; often\r\nobscure from its very verbosity; and, when clear, fatiguing the reader\r\nby so thoroughly exhausting the subject as to leave nothing for him to\r\ndo but read. He called his style of reasoning \"the _exhaustive_ mode,\"\r\nand he crowded it full of crabbed words of his own invention. He wrote\r\nmany of his works in French, and they were given to the world by Dumont,\r\na Genevan. Hazlitt has wittily said: \"His works have been translated\r\ninto French; they ought to be translated into English.\" Sydney Smith,\r\nwhen reviewing his \"Book of Fallacies,\" remarks, in his quaint way,\r\n\"Whether it is necessary there should be a middleman between the\r\ncultivator and the possessor, learned economists have doubted; but\r\nneither gods, men, nor booksellers, can doubt the necessity of a\r\nmiddleman between Mr. Bentham and the public.* * The mass of readers\r\nwill choose to become acquainted with him through the medium of Reviews,\r\nafter that eminent philosopher has been washed, trimmed, shaved, and\r\nforced into clean linen.\"\r\n\r\nBentham invented the words _Codify_ and _Codification_, now in such\r\ngeneral use. But let it not be supposed that he was guilty of the\r\nabsurdity of imagining that the entire laws of a Commonwealth could be\r\ncompressed into a single volume; nor of that other absurdity, that the\r\nlaws can be written so plain that the meanest capacity can understand\r\nthem fully, and apply them, without mistakes, to all the varieties of\r\nhuman rights and wrongs, and the ever-shifting vagaries and exigencies\r\nof society. He never had wit enough to see how it was, that what never\r\ncould be true in regard to any other science or species of writing, must\r\nbe true in regard to jurisprudence and legislation. He left that\r\ndiscovery for penny-a-liners, who believe all the law the world needs\r\ncan be printed between the yellow covers of a twenty-page pamphlet.\r\n\r\nBentham labored without any apparent success at home for years. He was\r\nfamous in France, and appreciated in Russia, before he was known in\r\nEngland. At length, his reiterated blows made an impression. He won\r\nconverts in high places, and they became his \"middlemen\" with the\r\npublic. Brougham and Smith spread out his great ideas in attractive\r\ncolors on the pages of the Edinburgh, and they sparkled in brilliant\r\nspeeches from Romilly and Mackintosh on the floor of Parliament. One\r\nafter another, the champions for the inviolability of the ancient system\r\nwere prostrated, till reasonable men admitted that, whether or not\r\nJeremy Bentham was right, the common law was certainly wrong, and must\r\nbe materially altered. Though he took no part in actual legislation, his\r\nwas the master mind that set other minds in motion; his genius, the\r\nsecret spring that operated a vast reformatory machine. He did not live\r\nto see his whole system adopted, (and would not, had he lived till the\r\nmillennium,) but he saw parts of it incorporated into the jurisprudence\r\nof his country, whilst other parts were postponed rather than rejected.\r\nHe saw the fruits of his labors in the amelioration of a sanguinary\r\ncriminal code, and especially in the abridgment of the death penalty--in\r\nthe improvement of the poor laws and penitentiaries, and the kindlier\r\ntreatment of prisoners--in the softening of the harsher features of\r\nimprisonment for debt, of the bankrupt laws, and the general law of\r\ndebtor and creditor--in lopping off some excrescences in chancery, and\r\ncutting down costs and simplifying the modes of procedure in other\r\ncourts--in the abolition of tests, and the emancipation of the\r\nCatholics--in the greater freedom of trade, the enlargement of the\r\nsuffrage, and the partial equalization of representation in\r\nParliament--in the appointment of commissioners to revise the whole mass\r\nof statute law, and reduce it to a uniform code--and, more than all, in\r\nthe conviction, penetrating a multitude of intelligent minds, that a\r\nlarge portion of the English law, as administered, so far from being the\r\nperfection of reason, was a disgrace to the human understanding, and the\r\nhomage paid to it a degrading idolatry.\r\n\r\nNor did he see these fruits in England alone. As he labored for the\r\nworld, so he saw the products of his toil in both hemispheres. France\r\nand Russia published his writings, and they were read in Germany and\r\nSwitzerland. His works were circulated at Calcutta and the Cape of Good\r\nHope; at New York, and New South Wales; in the Canadas, and the\r\nRepublics of South America. This country profits by his culture in the\r\nsimplification of its laws, and their revision and codification in many\r\nof its States--in the comparative humanity of its criminal codes and\r\nprison discipline--and especially in the recent sweeping reforms in the\r\npractice of its courts in three or four States, and the abolition of the\r\nmonopoly of the legal profession--a monopoly worthless to those whom it\r\nprotected, and galling to those whom it excluded. By no means do I\r\nintend to say, that to him we are solely indebted for these reforms. But\r\nhis hand planted the tree whose fruit is now being gathered. His chief\r\nglory is the emancipation of the Anglo-Saxon mind from a blind idolatry\r\nof the English common law; and for this he deserves unmeasured praise.\r\n\r\nMr. Bentham was kind, cheerful, simple-hearted, witty, and greatly\r\nbeloved by his friends. Frank, so frank that he was bluff, he refused a\r\ncostly present from the Emperor of Russia, lest he should be tempted to\r\npraise when he ought to blame. A great husbander of moments, he took air\r\nand exercise while entertaining ordinary visitors; and, when conversing\r\non his favorite themes with such as Romilly and Brougham, kept his\r\nsecretaries busy in noting down their remarks. The ridicule and abuse of\r\nwhich he was the subject rarely reached its aim, for he avoided personal\r\ncontroversies, discussing principles, and not men. He died in 1832, in\r\nthe 85th year of his age; and gave a singular evidence of his attachment\r\nto his principles, by bequeathing his body to the surgeon's knife, for\r\nthe advancement of medical science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n     Law Reform--The Penal Code of England--Its Barbarity--The\r\n     Death-Penalty--Sir Samuel Romilly--His Efforts to Abolish Capital\r\n     Punishment--His Talents and Character.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest mouth piece of Jeremy Bentham in Parliament, and his\r\n\"middleman\" with the public, was Sir SAMUEL ROMILLY. This accomplished\r\nlawyer, from the period he entered Parliament, in 1806, till his death,\r\nin 1818, directed his main efforts to Law Reform; especially the\r\namelioration of the Penal Code, and the diminution of the number of\r\ncapital offenses.\r\n\r\nThe present criminal code of England is a disgrace to civilization. When\r\nRomilly commenced his labors, it would have disgraced barbarism.\r\nBlackstone had said in his Commentaries, (and it was substantially true\r\nin 1806,) \"Among the variety of actions which men are liable daily to\r\ncommit, no less than one hundred and sixty are declared by act of\r\nParliament to be felonies, without benefit of clergy; or, in other\r\nwords, to be worthy of instant death.\" I will specify a few items in\r\nthis bloody catalogue. Treason, murder, arson, and rape, were of course\r\ncapital crimes. So was counterfeiting coin; refusing to take the oath of\r\nallegiance under various circumstances; falsifying judicial records;\r\ntaking a reward for restoring stolen goods, when accessory with the\r\nthief; obstructing the service of legal process; hunting in the night\r\ndisguised; writing threatening letters, to extort money; pulling down\r\nturnpike gates; assembling to produce riots, and not dispersing at the\r\norder of a magistrate; transporting wool or sheep twice out of the\r\nkingdom; smuggling; fraudulent bankruptcies; marrying a couple except in\r\n\"a church,\" without the license of the Archbishop of Canterbury, and\r\nmaking false entries in relation thereto in a marriage register;\r\nwandering as gipsies thirty days; burglary, in the night; stealing, from\r\nthe person, property above the value of twelve pence, or, from a\r\ndwelling-house, above five shillings, or a vessel above forty shillings;\r\nstealing fish, hares, and conies; robbing on the highway to the value of\r\na farthing; forgery in all its multiplied forms; sundry mere trespasses\r\nto personal property, such as tearing down fences, opening fish-ponds,\r\ndestroying trees in parks and gardens, maiming cattle--and the list\r\nmight be swelled through a chapter.\r\n\r\nThe legal mode of inflicting punishment, in many of these cases, was\r\nequally barbarous with the penalties. Not content with killing the\r\nwretch, he might be dragged to the place of execution at the heels of\r\nhorses; or emboweled while alive; or burnt to death; or beheaded,\r\nquartered, and the parts nailed up in conspicuous places; or his\r\nskeleton left to rot on the gallows; or his hands and ears cut off, and\r\nhis nostrils slit; or be branded on the cheek or hand, before execution.\r\nAnd down to the reign of William III, counsel were not allowed to\r\nprisoners, even in cases of high treason, when the whole power of the\r\nGovernment was brought to crush them; and it was not till the recent\r\nreign of William IV, that, in other capital cases, counsel for the\r\naccused were allowed to do more than state points of law to the court.\r\n\r\nSuch a Penal Code would disgrace the Fejee Islands. Yet, it was, in its\r\nmain features, the law of England in 1806; and, notwithstanding the\r\nlucubrations of Bentham, the dashing essays of Brougham, and the lucid\r\nspeeches of Romilly and Mackintosh, sustained by the protests and the\r\npetitions of churchmen and dissenters, Catholics and Quakers, it\r\nremained the law, with slight modifications, till the reign of George\r\nIV; and much of it is law to this day! And this code could be eulogized\r\nby the classical Blackstone; whilst Paley, the archdeacon, could\r\ncongratulate the readers of his Moral Philosophy on the fact, that\r\ntorture to extort confessions had been excluded \"from the mild and\r\ncautious system of penal jurisprudence established in this country!\"\r\nSuch mildness _is_ a \"caution!\" The same author, alluding to those who\r\nmight happen to be convicted and hung through mistake, counsels their\r\nsurviving friends not to repine, but \"rather to reflect that he who\r\nfalls by a mistaken sentence, may be considered as falling for his\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nNo one will suppose that such laws, the offspring of the dark ages,\r\ncould be enforced against all offenders after the sunrise of the\r\nnineteenth century. Still, capital convictions under them were\r\nfrightfully numerous. The statistics of English criminal jurisprudence\r\nafford abundant illustrations of the doctrines, that the severity of the\r\nlaw does not diminish crime, and that the certainty rather than the\r\nseverity of punishment is the surest preventive. These doctrines had\r\nbeen maintained with great power by Lord Bacon, by Stiernhook, the\r\nSwedish Blackstone, by Blackstone himself, by the Marquis of Beccaria,\r\nby Voltaire, by Montesquieu, by Bentham; and even Paley had admitted\r\ntheir truth. Romilly enforced them in Parliament; and it may be safely\r\naffirmed, that the history of crime proves nothing if it does not\r\nestablish their truth. Larcenies, burglaries, robberies, and forgeries,\r\nhad increased in England during the eighteenth century, much beyond the\r\nadvance of population and commerce, notwithstanding the severity of the\r\nlaw and its frequent execution. But these obvious facts were assigned to\r\nother causes than defects in the penal code, and these doctrines were\r\nscouted as the dogmas of visionary enthusiasts, by nearly the whole of\r\nthe bench, the bar, and the leading influences in Church and State, at\r\nthe dawn of the present century. They admitted that the unvarying\r\nexecution of the law would be barbarous; but insisted that its\r\nfrightful penalties ought to be suspended over the heads of offenders,\r\nto deter from crime; whilst they trusted to indirect modes of softening\r\nits rigors. So, judges undertook to bend the law to suit the merits of\r\nparticular cases; and the humanity of juries, outrunning the injunctions\r\nof their oaths, opened the door of escape in cases of peculiar severity.\r\nThe latter would frequently find that the value of the property stolen\r\ndid not reach the capital point; as, that a shilling piece was worth but\r\neleven pence farthing; or a crown, but four shillings and sixpence; or\r\ngoods for which the thief had asked L8, and refused L6, were worth but\r\nthirty-nine shillings; thus stultifying their senses to save a life\r\nwhich the law clamored to sacrifice.\r\n\r\nAnother evil resulting from the severity of the English code, was felt,\r\nnot only in that country, but has reached us and our times, and will\r\nafflict us so long as we are governed by the common law. Merciful\r\njudges, during the trial of offenders for minor crimes punishable with\r\ndeath, would lend a greedy ear to the ingenious cavils and absurd quirks\r\nof counsel, and quash the indictment--or refine away the plain words of\r\na statute, so as to exclude the offense from its operation--anything to\r\nsave the life of a fellow-creature whose crime deserved a ten days'\r\ncommitment to the House of Correction. And we are now reaping the fruits\r\nof this; for, be it known to the uninitiated, that all these cavils,\r\nrefinings, quibbles, quirks, and quiddities, are recorded in books, and\r\nhave come down to us as authoritative parts of \"the perfection of human\r\nreason,\" making convenient holes for sturdy rogues, with the help of\r\nsharp-pointed lawyers, to creep through the meshes of our comparatively\r\nmild criminal code.\r\n\r\nSir SAMUEL ROMILLY found the penal law of England thus sanguinary on the\r\nstatute book; thus abused in its administration by the courts; thus\r\nentrenched behind the authority of judges, lawyers, statesmen, and\r\ndivines, when he commenced the humane but apparently hopeless task of\r\nsoftening its penalties to the milder civilization of the present age.\r\nHe brought to this work professional eminence the most exalted, talents\r\nof the rarest order, learning varied and accurate, eloquence captivating\r\nand powerful, and a zeal and courage surpassed only by the benevolent\r\nwarmth of his heart. Having previously secured some reforms in the civil\r\nlaw, he carried a bill, in 1808, repealing the capital part of the act\r\nagainst stealing property of above twelve-pence value. This horrid law\r\nhad existed more than a thousand years, and probably in a thousand cases\r\nin which it had been executed, the hangman's rope cost more than the\r\nstolen property for which a life was forfeited. Even then Romilly could\r\ninduce the legislature to fix the death-limit no higher than L15. This\r\nand another repealing act had slipped through Parliament in a very quiet\r\nway, without exciting the attention of the country. In 1809, Romilly\r\nproposed two bills, repealing the laws making it capital to steal to the\r\nvalue of above five shillings from a shop, or forty from a\r\ndwelling-house. He sustained them by a speech, which exhibited great\r\nresearch into the statistics of crime, comprehensive views of the\r\nphilosophy of rewards and punishments, lofty appeals to humanity, and a\r\njust appreciation of the benevolent and liberal tendencies of the times.\r\nBoth bills failed. But the friends of the halter had become alarmed at\r\nthese reiterated attempts to restrict the death-penalty. The\r\ngallows-toad, touched by the spear of Ithuriel, started up a devil. It\r\nwas the first time the mask had been torn from the penal code of\r\nEngland, and its visage, grim and bloody, exposed to the public eye. The\r\nexcitement caused by this attempt to narrow the scaffold is at this day\r\nincredible. The chancellor in his robes, and the bishop in his lawn; the\r\nbarrister in his silk gown, and the attorney in his threadbare coat; the\r\nreviewer in the aristocratic quarterly, and the obscure pamphleteer in\r\nGrub street; all entered the lists to crush the disciple of Jeremy\r\nBentham, and demolish his dangerous heresies. If Romilly had attacked\r\nthe monarchy itself, or declared that the horse-hair wig of the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury was not a part of the British Constitution, he\r\ncould hardly have produced more indignation among judges and hangmen;\r\nmore consternation among the old women of both sexes. Jack Ketch was no\r\nlonger to hang men for stealing a cast-off coat or petticoat worth five\r\nshillings and six pence, and what would become of England! Sir Samuel\r\npublished a pamphlet containing the substance of his great speech, with\r\nadditional statistics, which Brougham made the basis of an able essay in\r\nthe Edinburgh. The pamphlet and the essay produced a profound impression\r\nupon liberal and humane minds throughout the country.\r\n\r\nBut, for two years, he was able to accomplish nothing in Parliament. In\r\n1811, he took advantage of some favoring circumstances to carry a law\r\nabolishing capital punishment in the cases of soldiers and sailors found\r\nbegging, without having testimonials of their discharge from the\r\nservice. Grateful country; to consent not to hang a sailor, who lost his\r\narm at Trafalgar, or a wooden-legged soldier who stormed Badajos, for\r\nbegging a loaf of bread! Through the seven following years, though\r\nRomilly and his coadjutors thundered on the floor of the Commons, and\r\nlightened from the pages of the Edinburgh, and rained down pamphlets\r\nupon the country, charged with appalling facts, unanswerable arguments,\r\nand glowing appeals to the heart of the nation, they fell on the\r\niron-mail of the Tory party only to rebound in their own faces; and this\r\ngreat man having bequeathed the prosecution of the work to Mackintosh,\r\nsunk into his grave, in 1818, without seeing one lineament of relenting\r\nin the grim visage of the Penal Code.\r\n\r\nBut, not alone to reforms in the criminal code did this excellent man\r\ngive his hand. He probed the Court of Chancery, and hove up to the sun\r\nsome of the abuses which festered under the stagnant administration of\r\nEldon--exposed the huge masses of rubbish which so blocked up the common\r\nlaw courts, that the difficulty of suitors to get in was only surpassed\r\nby the impossibility of their getting out; and though the reforms which\r\nhe proposed were very moderate, and aimed only at glaring defects, they\r\nencountered the same bigoted attachment to ancient abuses which assailed\r\nhim in the other field of his exertions. Lord Eldon especially construed\r\nevery insinuation that the system of Equity was not perfect, into a\r\npersonal attack on its head. He regarded a peep into his court as Jack\r\nKetch did a side-glance at the gallows, and repelled every insinuation\r\nthat he was not competent to do for men's property what Jack did for\r\ntheir lives--suspend animation by stopping the circulation.\r\n\r\nNor was it law reform alone which enlisted the sympathies of Romilly. As\r\nSolicitor General he brought in the bill for the abolition of the slave\r\ntrade, in 1806-7; and in 1814, when the European treaty of Peace,\r\nnegotiated by Castlereagh on the part of England, and which provided for\r\nthe revival of the traffic by France, came before Parliament, he led the\r\nfriends of humanity to the attack upon that article of it in a speech of\r\nthe loftiest rebuke, breathing the purest philanthropy and attired in\r\nthe richest garb of eloquence. His eulogium on Wilberforce and Clarkson\r\nwas beautiful, and his appeal to the former, as he turned and addressed\r\nhim personally, thrilling.\r\n\r\nRomilly's mind was cast in the rarest mold, and his heart was attuned to\r\nthe liveliest emotions. He could master the understanding with his\r\nreason, and sway the will by his persuasion. He frowned down meanness\r\nwith the dignity of a judge sentencing a culprit, and his sarcasm was\r\ntoo keen to be often provoked. Standing at the head of the Equity bar,\r\nhis professional attainments covered the widest field, and were only\r\nequaled by the extensive practice to which they were applied. His\r\ncharacter was beautifully pure, and he was the delight, almost the idol,\r\nof his intimate friends. Yet, his modesty always held him back from\r\nassuming in the courts and the Commons the place that was assigned to\r\nhim by the universal homage of his party, and the all but unanimous\r\nverdict of his opponents.\r\n\r\nRomilly was the grandson of a French mechanic, who, with his wife, fled\r\nto England, on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. His father married\r\nthe daughter of a refugee, and Samuel was, therefore, of pure French\r\nblood. He was born in 1757. His father, who was a watchmaker, articled\r\nhim to a commercial house, the death of whose head soon threw him back\r\ninto his father's shop, where he kept the books for two or three years.\r\nDuring this time, he marked out for himself, and pursued with avidity\r\nand success, a course of classical study. Leaving the shop, he entered\r\nas an apprentice the office of one of the clerks in chancery, and for\r\nseveral years devoted all the leisure hours he could snatch from the\r\ndrudgery of business, to the cultivation of general literature. Arriving\r\nat his majority, he studied law, and was called to the bar at the age of\r\ntwenty-five--an admirable specimen of \"a self-made man\"--the only sort\r\nof MAN, by the bye, that is made. The following anecdote shows how his\r\nsensitive mind was, in mere childhood, bent toward the work which\r\nengrossed his mature years. He says: \"A dreadful impression was made on\r\nme by relations of murders and acts of cruelty. The prints which I found\r\nin the Lives of the Martyrs, and the Newgate Calendar, have cost me many\r\nsleepless nights. My dreams, too, were disturbed by the hideous images\r\nwhich haunted my imagination by day. I thought myself present at\r\nexecutions, murders, and scenes of blood; and I have often lain in bed,\r\nagitated by my terrors, equally afraid of remaining awake in the dark,\r\nand of falling asleep to encounter the horrors of my dreams. Often have\r\nI, in my evening prayers to God, besought him, with the utmost fervor,\r\nto suffer me to pass the night undisturbed by horrid dreams.\" And it may\r\nbe that these childish terrors had something to do with his painfully\r\ntragic fall. The death of a wife to whom he was fondly attached, and\r\nover whose bed he had watched with agonizing solicitude, threw him into\r\na paroxysm of insanity, and he terminated with his own hand a life which\r\nEngland could not afford to lose. He was proud to acknowledge himself\r\nthe disciple, in law reform, of Jeremy Bentham, and the friendship\r\nbetween him and Henry Brougham was as strong as the cords of a brotherly\r\naffection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n     Law Reform--The Penal Code--Restriction of the Penalty of Death in\r\n     1823-4--Appointment of Commissioners to reform the Civil Law in\r\n     1828-9--Sir James Mackintosh--Brougham--Robert Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the death of Romilly, the leadership in the reformation of the\r\ncriminal code devolved on Sir JAMES MACKINTOSH. At the election just\r\nbefore his decease, the liberal party largely increased its members of\r\nParliament. Early in the session of 1819, Sir James carried a motion\r\nagainst Ministers for a committee to revise the penal code. He was\r\nappointed its chairman; and in 1820-1, in pursuance of its doings,\r\nintroduced six bills for the abrogation of capital punishment in certain\r\ncases of forgery, larceny, and robbery, and amending the law in other\r\nimportant particulars. The bills were defeated. A partial effort at\r\nreform was made the next session, and one or two feeble triumphs\r\nachieved. But the day was dawning. In 1823, Sir James proposed nine\r\nresolutions, providing for radical reforms in the penal code. Mr. Peel,\r\nthe Home Secretary, caused these propositions to be rejected, only that\r\nMinisters might introduce bills of their own, which largely restricted\r\nthe death-penalty, and prepared the way for other repealing acts, till\r\ncapital punishment was abrogated in some fifty cases. Thus the dark and\r\nsanguinary system which had so long reared its front over the\r\njurisprudence of England, received a fell blow.\r\n\r\nIn 1828, Mr. Brougham made his celebrated speech in favor of remodeling\r\nthe whole civil branch of the common law. Near the close he said: \"It\r\nwas the boast of Augustus--it formed part of the glare in which the\r\nperfidies of his earlier years were lost--that he found Rome of brick,\r\nand left it of marble--a praise not unworthy a great prince. But how\r\nmuch nobler will be the sovereign's boast, when he shall have it to say,\r\nthat he found law dear, and left it cheap--found it a sealed book, left\r\nit a living letter--found it the patrimony of the rich, left it the\r\ninheritance of the poor--found it the two-edged sword of craft and\r\noppression, left it the staff of honesty and the shield of innocence!\"\r\nThis speech, one of the greatest Mr. Brougham ever delivered, was\r\nfollowed by an address to the throne for the appointment of\r\ncommissioners to inquire into the origin, progress, and termination of\r\nactions in the courts, and into the state of the law regarding real\r\nproperty. Two commissions were immediately instituted; one of general\r\ncommon law inquiry; the other, of inquiry into the law of real estate.\r\nAfterwards, the subjects of codification, consolidation of the statutes,\r\nand reform of the criminal law, were referred to other commissions. The\r\ncommission to inquire into abuses in courts of equity had previously\r\nbeen appointed. Some twenty or thirty of the ablest lawyers in the\r\nkingdom were placed on these commissions, several of whom have since\r\nbeen elevated to the bench. Their elaborate reports, presented during\r\nthe past twenty years, have displayed vast research and learning, and\r\nthe numerous reforms recommended by them, exhibiting a cautious but\r\nsteady advance in the path of improvement, have generally been adopted\r\nby the legislature. Though the prevailing law of England still continues\r\na chaos of absurdities and excellences, the reforms introduced by these\r\ncommissioners will be appreciated by all who have occasion to explore\r\nthe intricate windings and gloomy chambers of the huge structure. The\r\nreports alluded to have been the textbooks of revisers and codifiers in\r\nother countries where the common law prevails, and were frequently\r\ncited, and their recommendations often adopted, by the able revisers of\r\nthe New York Statutes--which last have served as the model for revisers\r\nin other States of the American Union.\r\n\r\nI am now to speak more particularly of Sir James Mackintosh, one of the\r\nbrightest ornaments of the liberal party of Great Britain. This eminent\r\nScotsman was born of humble parentage, in 1765. At the University of\r\nAberdeen he met Robert Hall, the celebrated Baptist divine, to whom he\r\nbecame warmly attached, \"because,\" as Sir James says, \"I could not help\r\nit.\" He adds, that he \"was fascinated by his brilliancy and acumen, in\r\nlove with his cordiality and ardor, and awe-struck by the transparency\r\nof his conduct and the purity of his principles.\" Their class-mates\r\ncalled them Plato and Herodotus. They traveled the whole field of\r\nancient and modern metaphysics and philosophy hand in hand, debating\r\nevery point as they went, till in Plato and Edwards, in Aristotle and\r\nBerkley, in Cicero and Butler, in Socrates and Bacon, there was scarcely\r\na principle they had not examined, and about which they had not enjoyed\r\na keen encounter of their wits. The heat engendered by these friendly\r\ncontroversies fused more completely into one their congenial natures.\r\nSuch an attachment, formed in the springtime of youth, was sure to\r\nendure; and though, in subsequent life, they moved in widely different\r\nspheres, their intimacy continued throughout their long career.\r\n\r\nBeing destined for the medical profession, Mackintosh took his degree at\r\nEdinburgh, and went up to London to practice. George III, then\r\nexhibiting symptoms of insanity, the subject of his illness and of\r\nmaking his son Regent was agitating Parliament when Mackintosh arrived\r\nin the metropolis. _Doctor_ Mackintosh, instead of prescribing for the\r\ndiseases of the king, wrote a pamphlet in favor of the claims of the\r\nprince; leaving the constitution of the monarch to take care of itself,\r\nwhile he attended to the constitution of the monarchy. The king suddenly\r\nrecovered, when, it being no longer necessary to administer medicine\r\neither to the Crown or the Constitution, the Prince of Wales returned\r\nto his mistresses, and Mackintosh went to Leyden to complete his\r\nstudies, where he lounged away a few months, reading Homer and\r\nHerodotus, to the great neglect of Galen and Hippocrates. Returning to\r\nEngland, he plunged into matrimony before he had sufficient practice to\r\nbuy an anatomical skeleton for his office. Happily, his wife sympathized\r\nin his literary tastes, and, at once detecting the defects of his\r\ncharacter, \"urged him to overcome his almost constitutional indolence.\"\r\n\r\nThe French revolution, which ruined so many fortunes, made his. In 1791,\r\nhe published a volume entitled \"_Vindiciae Gallicae_, or, a Defense of the\r\nFrench Revolution and its English Admirers against the Accusations of\r\nthe Rt. Hon. Edmund Burke.\" The very title-page immediately carried off\r\nthe first edition, and the acute reasoning, brilliant declamation, and\r\nclassic style of this vigorous but immature production gave currency to\r\nthree editions at the end of four months. There was a great deal of\r\n_heady_ strength in both these essays. Mackintosh's was like a river\r\nsweeping to the ocean, covered with sparkling foam. Burke's like the\r\nlong, heavy swells of that ocean, whose crests are pelted by the winds\r\nand dance in the sun. Both authors set up for prophets; and, like other\r\ninspired and less famous men, they mistook the illusions of their fancy\r\nand the suggestions of their imagination for the visions of the seer and\r\nthe teachings of the divine _inflatus_. Burke was nearer right as to the\r\nresult of the then pending revolution; but Europe would now account\r\nMackintosh the best prophet. This volume gave Mackintosh an introduction\r\nto Fox and the other Whig chiefs, and he became their warm friend. Soon\r\nafter, falling into the captivating society of Burke, his teachings\r\ncombined with the sanguinary turn of French affairs to considerably\r\nmodify the views put forth in his _Vindiciae_.\r\n\r\nThrowing physic to the dogs, Mackintosh entered Lincoln's Inn, and was\r\ncalled to the bar in 1795. But, though the study of the law was more\r\ncongenial to his tastes than medicine, his practice in his new\r\nprofession was scarcely more extensive than in the old. In truth, he was\r\ntoo indolent, too desultory in his efforts, too fond of literature and\r\nabstract speculation, to excel in any pursuit requiring close\r\napplication and orderly habits, rendering his whole life a series of\r\nbrilliant but mere inchoate performances. In 1798, he proposed to\r\ndeliver a series of lectures in Lincoln's Inn, on the Law of Nature and\r\nof Nations. The doors were closed against him, because of his supposed\r\nJacobinical principles--the Benchers of that conservative corporation\r\nnot wishing to have the doctrines of the _Vindiciae Gallicae_ promulgated\r\nin their halls. Mackintosh published his introductory lecture to refute\r\nthe charge of Jacobinism, and it was so tinctured with Burkeism, and so\r\nphilosophical and eloquent, that it captivated Pitt, who persuaded the\r\nChancellor to recommend the opening of the Inn. It was done, and\r\nMackintosh entranced a learned audience throughout his gorgeous course.\r\n\r\nHis next attractive performance was the defense of Peltier, a French\r\nrefugee, the editor of the _Ambigu_, for an alleged libel on Napoleon,\r\nthe First Consul. His oration (for it partook little of the character of\r\na speech at the bar) in vindication of the liberty of the press was\r\npronounced by Lord Ellenborough, the chief justice, to be the most\r\neloquent address ever delivered in Westminster Hall. Madame de Stael\r\nsent it through Europe in a French translation, and it secured for its\r\nauthor a continental reputation. And in our day and country it is read\r\nby thousands who have hardly heard of any other production of his tongue\r\nor pen. His lectures and his oration not only gave him celebrity, but,\r\nwhat he needed quite as much, a little money; and they brought him an\r\noffer of a judicial station at Bombay. Still pressed by pecuniary\r\nembarrassments, after much reluctance, he consented to be banished, with\r\nhis wife and children, from his native land, to an inhospitable clime\r\namongst a strange people. For nearly eight years he discharged his\r\njudicial duties with fidelity, but through every month of those years\r\nhe sighed for his country and its healthy breezes, his associates and\r\ntheir brilliant society. He relieved the tedium of his expatriation by\r\nmaking some researches into Oriental institutions, by founding a\r\nliterary club at Bombay, and by indulging, in his desultory way, in\r\nclassical and philosophical pursuits. His study and administration of\r\nthe criminal laws of India turned his attention to the subject which\r\noccupied so large a share of his subsequent Parliamentary life--the\r\npenal code of England.\r\n\r\nThe generous and philanthropic mind which had prompted the extension of\r\nthe right-hand of fellowship to the emancipated masses of France, in\r\n1791, and which, forty years later, was stretched forth to break the\r\nchains from the limbs of the West India bondmen, was not slow to see\r\nthat the criminal code of his own country was the legitimate offspring\r\nof a black and bloody age. Returning to England in 1811, he entered\r\nParliament in 1813, where he remained until his death, in 1832. He\r\npromptly took his seat by the side of his friends, Brougham and Romilly,\r\nand threw his great soul into the contest of the People with the Crown.\r\nThe important questions growing out of the European and American wars,\r\nin regard to the rights of neutrals, were then pending, and he joined\r\nBrougham in advocating liberal measures. And, to the end of his\r\nlegislative career, on all questions of foreign policy and continental\r\ncombinations, on the alien bill and the liberty of the press, on\r\nCatholic emancipation and the abolition of slavery, on the recognition\r\nof South American independence and the settlement of Greece, on the\r\neducation of the poor and the freedom of trade, on the relief of the\r\nDissenters and Parliamentary reform, he was ever found on the side of\r\njustice and humanity. For a short period he was the leader of the\r\nliberal party in the Commons, but he soon relinquished the post to the\r\nmore daring and robust Brougham. Indeed, Sir James had not the capacity\r\nfor leading a popular body like the House of Commons. He was too\r\nindolent in mastering dry details, too little of a business man, and\r\nhis style of oratory was too philosophical, classical, and refined, to\r\nproduce the best effect on such an assembly. He spoke over the heads of\r\ncountry squires and men of the 'change, who could not translate his\r\nGreek and Latin quotations, nor catch the point of his learned\r\nallusions, nor see precisely what these had to do with the traffic in\r\ncorn or negroes, or the overthrow of the Holy Alliance abroad, or the\r\nuprooting of rotten boroughs at home. When Hume figured before the\r\nHouse, with his bales of statistics, these plain men could arrive at the\r\nsum total of what he was at. When Canning's arrows whirled about the\r\nheads of the Opposition, they could see them quivering in the flesh of\r\nhis antagonists. When Romilly's eloquence wafted gently over them, they\r\nwere refreshed and delighted. And even when Brougham shook the walls\r\nlike an earthquake, they understood why they held so fast to their\r\nseats. But Mackintosh's Plato and Priam, his Homer and his Helicon, were\r\n\"Greek\" to them. His speeches were better adapted to be read in the\r\nlibrary of the scholar than to be heard in the Commons House of\r\nParliament. It was these defects in his oratory, and his utter want of\r\nall taste for business, and his indolent and immethodical habits, which\r\nkept him behind men of inferior talents and acquirements while his party\r\nwas in opposition, and gave him no prominent place in its counsels when\r\nit assumed the reins of Government. Sydney Smith, in a characteristic\r\nletter to Sir James's son, writes thus: \"Curran, the Master of the\r\nRolls, said to Grattan, 'You would be the greatest man of your age,\r\nGrattan, if you would buy a few yards of red tape, and tie up your bills\r\nand papers.' This was the fault or misfortune of your excellent father.\r\nHe never knew the use of red tape, and was utterly unfit for the common\r\nbusiness of life.\"\r\n\r\nMackintosh was a man of the purest benevolence and the liveliest\r\nphilanthropy. He held all his vast literary and philosophical\r\nattainments cheap in comparison with his labors in the cause of\r\nhumanity. The friendless criminal, shuddering in the dock under the\r\nfrown of some heartless judge--the imbruted slave, writhing under the\r\nlash of a task-master in the islands of the West--the yeoman at his\r\nplow, deprived of the electoral rights which the very sods he tilled\r\ncould enjoy--the educated Dissenter and Catholic, shut out from stations\r\nof honor and trust for refusing a test which stained their consciences,\r\nwere all advanced to a higher civilization and a broader field of civil\r\nand religious freedom, by his aid. He was the zealous co-worker of\r\nWilberforce and Clarkson, of Brougham and Buxton, of Sturge and\r\nLushington, in the work of negro emancipation. His last, greatest,\r\nspeech in Parliament was on the Reform Bill. Bulwer says of it: \"I shall\r\nnever forget the extensive range of ideas, the energetic grasp of\r\nthought, the sublime and soaring strain of legislative philosophy, with\r\nwhich he charmed and transported me.\" Before such services as he\r\nrendered to the cause of man, how all the acquisitions and displays of\r\nthe scholar and the metaphysician grow pale!\r\n\r\nI have spoken of his intimacy with ROBERT HALL. There was a striking\r\nsimilarity in the structure of their minds and in their literary tastes.\r\nThe politician was a classical, philosophical lawyer and\r\nParliamentarian. The divine was a classical, philosophical theologian\r\nand preacher. Each was fond of abstract speculation--each was a profound\r\nand original reasoner and thinker--each reveled in the literature of the\r\nancients--each was a writer of whom any nation or age might be proud.\r\nHall much excelled his friend in the high walks of oratory, and the\r\npower of riveting, of transfixing an auditory, and holding them\r\nspell-bound while he played with their passions and emotions with\r\nmasterly skill. The first pulpit orator of his day, in the zenith of his\r\nfame he could attract a greater crowd of rare men than any other\r\npreacher in the metropolis or the country. The same cannot be affirmed\r\nof Mackintosh in the theater where he displayed his forensic powers. The\r\nspeech which so transported Bulwer _in_ the House of Commons, because\r\nof defects in the delivery transported half the members _out_ of it.\r\nEach shone no less in the social circle than in the forum. While\r\nMackintosh was the more ornate and classical talker, Hall surpassed him\r\nin keen sarcasm and solid argument. The conversational talents of Hall\r\nwere more appreciable by ordinary capacities, his style being racy,\r\noff-hand, bold. Mackintosh was fitted to be the companion of polite\r\nscholars and learned critics, and his conversation was more showy,\r\ndazzling, and prepared. The wit of Hall, when in full play, approached\r\nto drollery, and his sarcasm cut to the bone. The wit of Mackintosh was\r\nAttic, and his sarcasm refined and delicate. Hall crushed a pedantic\r\nfool with a single blow of his truncheon. Mackintosh tossed him on the\r\nend of his lance. Hall made no effort to shine in society, and all his\r\ngood things seemed to bubble up naturally from a full fountain, whilst\r\nhis strength was reserved for public exhibitions, where he shone in\r\nsplendor. Mackintosh elaborated his social effusions, (and it was his\r\nweakness,) and his best things gushed like _jet d'eaus_ from prepared\r\nreservoirs; and if he failed to win applause at St. Stephen's, he was\r\nsure to be the center of attraction at Holland House. Hall put down\r\nupstartism like a judge at _nisi prius_ rebuking a shallow barrister for\r\ncontempt of court. Mackintosh pricked the gas-bag with the delicate\r\ninstrument of his irony. Hall was loved by his friends. Mackintosh was\r\nadmired by his associates. Each was a philanthropist and reformer, and\r\neach in his sphere was in advance of his times in catholicity of spirit,\r\nboldness of speculation, and freedom from the cant of party and sect.\r\n\r\nThe works of Mackintosh are numerous--though some of his best writings\r\nhardly deserve to be called _works_, in the incomplete state in which he\r\nleft them. Besides those already mentioned, there may be noted many rich\r\ncontributions to the Edinburgh Review and other periodicals--some\r\nParliamentary and anniversary speeches--a beautiful life of Sir Thomas\r\nMore--an acute and eloquent dissertation in the Encyclopedia Britannica\r\non the General View of the Progress of Ethical Philosophy--and a\r\nFragment of English History concerning the Revolution of 1688.\r\n\r\nDuring his lifetime, Sir James was abused by the Tories; nor did the\r\ntirade cease at his death. Somewhat covetous of fame, and utterly\r\nreckless of gold, he left little to his children, except a brilliant\r\nreputation and principles that can never die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n     Religious Toleration--Eminent Nonconformists--The Puritans--Oliver\r\n     Cromwell--The Pilgrims--The Corporation and Test Acts--Their\r\n     Origin--Their Effects upon Dissenters and others--Their virtual\r\n     Abandonment and final Repeal--The first Triumph of the Reformers.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor centuries it was a settled maxim in England, that the only sure way\r\nto convert a heretic was to put him to death. All dominant sects have\r\nbeen persecutors in their turn. The Papists burnt the Episcopalians, the\r\nEpiscopalians decapitated the Puritans, and the Puritans hung the\r\nQuakers. With the advancing light of civilization, the dungeon and the\r\npillory were substituted for the scaffold and the stake. Then, as each\r\nsect had the power, it imprisoned, scourged, and cropped the others. At\r\nlength, bigotry was satisfied with imposing pecuniary fines and civil\r\ndisabilities on schismatics. Though it is long since the nostrils of a\r\ndominant sect in England have been regaled with the incense of a\r\nroasting heretic, it is only twenty years since the Established Church\r\nof that country erased from the statute book the grosser penalties\r\nagainst the exercise of the rights of conscience, leaving a sufficient\r\nnumber unrepealed to operate as a terror to evil doers, and a praise and\r\na profit to them that do not \"dissent.\"\r\n\r\nThe struggle between Right and Prerogative, which has agitated the\r\nkingdom for the past half century, has not been confined to civil\r\ninstitutions. The miter of the archbishop has not been deemed more\r\nsacred from scrutiny than the crown of the monarch. The Church as well\r\nas the State has been shaken by the earthquake tread of Reform.\r\nProminent among the divines of our time, who have materially contributed\r\nto these results, stand Robert Hall, John Angell James, Ralph Wardlaw,\r\nThomas Chalmers, and Baptist W. Noel. But the tree of Toleration, whose\r\nfruits the people of England are now gathering, was planted long ago by\r\nhallowed hands. Distinguished among those who, in the expressive phrase\r\nof Burke, early preached and practiced \"the dissidence of Dissent, and\r\nthe protestantism of the Protestant religion,\" are Baxter, Owen, Calamy,\r\nHowe, Flavel, Henry, Bunyan, Bates, Doddridge, Law, Watts, and Fuller;\r\nnames illustrious in the annals of Nonconformity, whose writings exerted\r\na wide influence among their cotemporaries, and in our day are the text\r\nbooks of the profoundest theologians, and the solace and guide of the\r\nmost humble and devout of the unlearned classes.\r\n\r\nIn tracing the origin of recent reforms in the ecclesiastical\r\ninstitutions of England, due credit should be given to the Puritans of\r\nthe times of Cromwell. In the convulsions of 1642-9, the English Church\r\nestablishment, the power which had held the national conscience in awe\r\nfor more than a century, was overthrown, and Puritanism became the\r\nprevailing religion of the Commonwealth. The professors of the new faith\r\nwere distinguished for a strange mixture of austere piety and wild\r\nfanaticism--the natural product of the times in which they lived. No\r\nwonder they were guilty of excesses. The tightest band breaks with the\r\nwildest power. Their extravagances were the spontaneous out-gush of the\r\nsoul, when freedom of opinion, suddenly let loose from the thraldom of\r\nages, found itself in a large place. Our Puritan fathers of the\r\nseventeenth century, by the recoil of the revolutionary wave, found\r\nthemselves standing on the _terra firma_ of the rights of conscience,\r\nhigh above the reach of the returning surge. They must have been more\r\nthan mortal, had they not roamed far and wide over the fair country\r\nwhich spread its tempting landscape around them. No wonder they\r\nindulged in wild speculations, and made extravagant investments, in\r\nthose then unexplored regions. They were like captives suddenly released\r\nfrom the galling chains and stifling atmosphere of the slave ship, who\r\ntread Elysian fields and inhale the intoxicating air of God's unfettered\r\nwinds. It is an evidence of their sincerity that they carried their\r\nreligion into everything, even their fighting and their politics. Bodies\r\nof their troops, often dispensing with what they denominated the carnal\r\ndrum and fife, marched to the harmony of David's Psalms, sung to the\r\ntunes of Mear and Old Hundred. Sermons, extending in length to six and\r\neight mortal hours, were preached to the regiments, by chaplains mounted\r\non artillery carriages. The camp of the revolutionists was not more the\r\nscene of rigid military drilling, than of warm discussions on the five\r\ncardinal points of their faith. The Roundheads in Parliament engaged in\r\ndebates on original sin, and the scriptural mode of baptism, as well as\r\nupon laws concerning the civil and military affairs of the State. The\r\nvery names which figure in the transactions of those times indicate the\r\nspirit of the age. There was Praise-God Barebones, Kill-sin Pimple,\r\nSmite-them-hip-and-thigh Smith, Through-much-tribulation-we-enter-into-\r\nthe-kingdom-of-heaven Jones--names as familiar as those of John Hampden\r\nand Harry Vane. What happier illustration of Cromwell's intuitive\r\nknowledge of the men he commanded, than his brief bulletin, pronounced\r\nat the head of his army, on the eve of one of the decisive battles of\r\nthe revolution, fought under a drizzling rain, \"_Soldiers trust in God;\r\nand keep your powder dry!_\" Faith and works.\r\n\r\nOLIVER CROMWELL, _the_ man of his age, and whose impartial biography is\r\nyet unwritten, was the soul of old Puritanism, and the warrior-apostle\r\nof religious toleration. He maintained this priceless principle in\r\nstormy debate, on the floor of Parliament, against the passive obedience\r\nof the Churchman, and the uniformity of the Presbyterian, and defended\r\nit amid the blaze and roar of battle against the brilliant gallantry of\r\nRupert and the fiery assaults of Lesley. The \"Ironsides\" of the\r\nrevolutionary forces, composed of the Independents of Huntingdonshire,\r\nconstituting the \"Imperial guard\" of the republican army, were raised\r\nand disciplined by Cromwell. Through long training, in the camp and the\r\nconventicle, he had fired them with a hatred of kingly and priestly\r\ntyranny, which, in after years, on many a field, under his leadership,\r\nswept to ruin the legions of an arrogant court and hierarchy. The\r\nhistoric pen of England has done injustice to him and to them. The\r\nreason is obvious. That pen has not been held by their friends, but\r\ntheir enemies. For a hundred years succeeding Cromwell's time, the\r\nEnglish scholar and historian was dependent on the rich and noble, in\r\nChurch and State, for patronage and bread. He must have been a rare man\r\nwho coveted opprobrium and penury, by writing against civil and\r\necclesiastical institutions, hoary with age and venerated by the great\r\nmass of his countrymen. And these very institutions Cromwell and his\r\nfollowers had temporarily overthrown. He assisted at the death of the\r\nmonarch--they aided to prostrate the church--bringing kings and\r\nsubjects, bishops and curates, to a common level. Can we expect the\r\nleveled to do justice to the leveler? English historians have written of\r\nhim and them as the beaten always write of the beaters--as the scattered\r\nof the scatterers--the vanquished of the victors. Admitting their\r\nextravagances and their austere sectarianism, the impartial pen will\r\nrecord of the Puritans of 1645, that they exhibited many of the fruits\r\nof a sincere piety, and fostered the germ of that toleration which\r\nblends the dignity of free thought with the humility of Christian\r\ncharity. Their descendants have exhibited all the heroic virtues of\r\ntheir fathers, tempered with the liberalizing influences of succeeding\r\ngenerations. Eminent for learning and piety, they have been the patrons\r\nof all the arts which adorn and purify mankind, and, in the darkest\r\nhours of the party of progress and reform, have been true to the good\r\ncause. The scion from the parent stock, planted by the Pilgrims at\r\nPlymouth, in 1620, struck its roots deep into our American soil, and\r\nmyriads of master minds in all the States of the Confederacy now repose\r\nunder its overshadowing foliage, and pluck the fruits of civil and\r\nreligious freedom from its spreading branches.\r\n\r\nThe power of the Established Church received a blow in the civil wars,\r\nfrom which it never fully recovered. At the Restoration, under Charles\r\nII, it took advantage of a real or fancied dread of the increase of\r\nPopery in the kingdom, to seduce Dissenters into an acquiescence in the\r\nadoption of laws favoring Episcopal supremacy, and which were\r\nsubsequently employed to oppress Protestant Nonconformists. The chief of\r\nthese were the _Corporation_ and _Test Acts_, to the enactment,\r\noperation, and final repeal of which, the reader's attention is invited.\r\n\r\nSays the complacent Blackstone, \"In order the better to secure the\r\nEstablished Church against perils from Nonconformists of all\r\ndenominations, Infidels, Turks, Jews, Heretics, Papists, and\r\nSectaries--there are two bulwarks erected, called the Corporation and\r\nTests Acts. By the former, (enacted in 1661,) no person can be legally\r\nelected to any office relating to the government of any city or\r\ncorporation, unless, within a twelvemonth before he has received the\r\nsacrament of the Lord's Supper according to the rites of the Church of\r\nEngland; and he is also enjoined to take the oaths of allegiance and\r\nsupremacy at the same time that he takes the oath of office; or, in\r\ndefault of either of these requisites, such election shall be void. The\r\nother, called the Test Act, (enacted in 1683,) directs all officers,\r\ncivil and military, to take the oaths and make the declaration against\r\ntransubstantiation, in any of the King's courts at Westminster, or at\r\nthe quarter sessions, within six months after their admission; and,\r\nalso, within three months to receive the sacrament of the Lord's Supper,\r\naccording to the usage of the Church of England, in some public church,\r\nimmediately after divine service and sermon, and to deliver into court a\r\ncertificate thereof, signed by the minister and churchwardens, and also\r\nto prove the same by two credible witnesses, upon forfeiture of L500,\r\nand disability to hold the same office.\" The disabilities operated still\r\nfurther. By subsequent enactments, if any person held office without\r\nsubmitting to the tests, he was not only fined L500, but was forever\r\nincapacitated from prosecuting any action in the courts of law or\r\nequity, from being the guardian of a child, or the executor or\r\nadministrator of a deceased person, or receiving a legacy. By subsequent\r\nlegislation, the same tests, except the sacrament, were exacted of\r\nvarious classes of persons not holding civil or military offices, such\r\nas dissenting ministers, practitioners of the law, teachers of schools\r\nor pupils, members of colleges who had attained the age of eighteen, &c.\r\n\r\nAs has been stated, the Corporation and Test Acts were passed when\r\nEngland was alarmed at a threatened invasion of Popery, and their\r\npenalties were intended to be aimed chiefly at Papists, though their\r\nsweeping provisions included all classes of Nonconformists. The\r\nProtestant dissenters, through fear or hatred of the Catholics,\r\nconsented to be placed under the general anathema, with a sort of\r\nunderstanding that, when the danger was over, they should be relieved\r\nfrom its pressure. They lived long enough to repent of their folly.\r\n\r\nThese acts were not only a gross violation of the rights of conscience,\r\nbut were injurious to the public weal in many respects, and beneficial\r\nin none. Whilst they never made one Christian, they deprived the State\r\nof the services of many of its best and bravest citizens, drove much of\r\nlearning and piety from the pulpit, and genius and promise from the\r\nuniversity. By making the profession of a particular creed a necessary\r\nqualification for office, and the reception of the Lord's Supper\r\naccording to a prescribed ritual the passport to civil and\r\necclesiastical advancement, they degraded the holiest rites of religion,\r\nbrought annually to the communion-table of the Establishment thousands\r\nof hypocrites, and placed constantly at its altars hundreds of\r\nhorse-racing and fox-hunting clergymen. They were a perpetual source of\r\nannoyance to dissenters who would not barter their faith for place and\r\npelf, by subjecting them to prosecutions for refusing to qualify\r\nthemselves for offices to which they had been maliciously elected, to be\r\nfollowed by ruinous fines or long imprisonments. In a single year (1736)\r\nL20,700 were raised from fines imposed on dissenters, who\r\nconscientiously refused to serve in the office of sheriff; and for a\r\nlong time it was the custom of municipal corporations to elect\r\ndissenters to office, and then enrich their coffers from fines levied\r\nupon them for refusing to receive the qualifying tests. At length, the\r\ncommon oppression drove Protestant and Catholic dissenters into a\r\nformidable union for the restoration of their common rights, and\r\nengendered a hatred of the Established Church, its clergy, its creed,\r\nand its ordinances, which twenty years of qualified toleration have not\r\nbeen able to abate or scarcely to mitigate.\r\n\r\nRepeated efforts were made for the repeal of these acts. Protestant\r\ndissenters, having suffered their penalties for nearly a century, grew\r\nnumerous and influential, when Parliament, instead of boldly meeting the\r\nquestion of repeal, began to exercise that temporizing cunning so\r\ncharacteristic of British legislation, and grudgingly ameliorated a\r\ngrievance which it had not the grace to wholly abrogate. It commenced\r\nthe practice of passing, at the close of each session, amnesty bills,\r\nexempting dissenters, who had violated the acts, from the operation of\r\ntheir penalties; and so framing the bills as to cover not only past\r\noffenses, but all which might be committed before the close of the next\r\nsession, when another bill would be enacted. This relieved dissenters\r\nfrom practical oppression under these acts, for some eighty years\r\nprevious to their final repeal.\r\n\r\nBut, so intelligent and high-minded a portion of the State were not\r\ncontent to receive rights inherent and immutable, as an annual boon from\r\nthe legislature. The struggle for unqualified repeal never ceased till\r\nthe disgraceful acts were blotted from the statute book. On the 26th of\r\nFebruary, 1828, was struck the first successful blow against the\r\nsupremacy of the Church of England since the Restoration. Lord John\r\nRussell moved that the House resolve itself into a Committee to take\r\ninto consideration the regulations of the Corporation and Test Acts. A\r\nstormy debate followed, in which Bigotry and Power made a desperate\r\nstand for victory. A division showed 237 for the motion, and 193 against\r\nit. In committee, Ministers entreated earnestly for delay, but a\r\nresolution was adopted for the instant repeal of the acts. A bill, based\r\non this resolution, was introduced, and passed its second reading. The\r\nBishop of Oxford rent his robes, and Lord Eldon shed many tears--but all\r\nin vain. After witnessing the temper of the House, Mr. Peel declared\r\nthat he was prepared to dismiss from his mind every idea of adhering to\r\nthe existing laws, and only asked for some slight modifications in the\r\npending bill. His request being complied with, Ministers withdrew from\r\nthe contest, and speedily the Corporation and Test Acts, the offspring\r\nof a grim and bigoted age, ceased to be the law of the realm.\r\n\r\nThis was the first cardinal measure which the modern reformers had\r\ncarried through Parliament (the abolition of the slave trade and the\r\nmelioration of the criminal code were advocated by the chiefs of both\r\nparties) during a conflict of nearly half a century. It was hailed as an\r\nera in the contests of the People with the Crown; the harbinger of\r\nbetter days to come; and was the first in a series of still more\r\nglorious achievements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n     Ireland--The Causes of its Debasement--Dublin--Mementoes of the\r\n     Captivity of the Country--Movements toward Catholic\r\n     Emancipation--Its Early Champions--Mr. Grattan--Mr.\r\n     Plunkett--Reverend Sydney Smith.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore specially considering Catholic Emancipation, I will notice two or\r\nthree persons who participated in the long struggle which prepared the\r\nway for this great measure of religious toleration. The act of\r\nEmancipation extended to Catholics alike in all parts of the United\r\nKingdom. But, as the large majority of the professors of that faith\r\ndwelt in Ireland, and as they composed nearly seven-eighths of its\r\npeople, and as it was there that the long and fierce conflict was waged\r\nwhich ultimately compelled English Protestants to yield to their\r\nCatholic fellow-subjects the rights of toleration which they themselves\r\nenjoyed, this was regarded as emphatically an Irish reform.\r\n\r\nIreland! What a throng of associated ideas start to life at the mention\r\nof that name! How varied their aspect--how contradictory their\r\ncharacter--how antagonistic the emotions they kindle, the sentiments\r\nthey inspire. Ireland, the land of genius and degradation, of vast\r\nresources and pinching poverty, of noble deeds and revolting crimes, of\r\nvaliant resistance to tyranny and obsequious submission to usurpation.\r\nIreland, the land of splendid orators, charming poets, and brave\r\nsoldiers; the land of ignorance, abjectness, and beggary; measureless in\r\nits capacities, stinted in its products, a strange anomaly, a\r\ncomplication of contradictions.\r\n\r\nThough this portraiture, sketched by no unfriendly hand, be but a rude\r\noutline, does it not shadow forth the original? Why are its darker\r\ncolors no less faithful delineations of the prominent features than the\r\nbrighter? The very problem which a whole century has not been able to\r\nsolve! The British Tory will point to what he calls \"the malign\r\ncharacter of the Irish,\" as the prime cause of the debasement and\r\nwretchedness which exist among them. The British Whig, whose zeal for\r\nProtestantism, as a mere _ism_, has clouded his judgment, will assign\r\nthe general prevalence of the Catholic religion in the island, as the\r\nsource of most of the evils which afflict it. The genuine Irishman, who\r\nregards his native isle as the greenest and fairest the sun ever smiled\r\nto shine upon, will tell you that, giving due weight to many obvious but\r\nsecondary influences, the degradation and misery which debase and crush\r\nsuch masses of his countrymen must be ascribed to the fact that Ireland,\r\nwhich could once boast of national independence, a regal sovereign, and\r\na royal Parliament, is now a mere appendage to the English Crown,\r\nwithout a name, a flag, or a Senate; an oppressed colony crouching under\r\na hated yoke of vassalage; a captive province paying tribute to a\r\nconqueror, who, having robbed it of nationality, appoints its rulers,\r\ndictates its laws, prescribes its ritual, plunders its wealth, tarnishes\r\nits reputation, and scoffs at its complainings.\r\n\r\nWaiving till another occasion the question whether the prime cause of\r\nIreland's miseries does not lie deeper than her compulsory and unnatural\r\nunion with Great Britain, let us enter a little further into the\r\nfeelings of the struggling Irishman. Go with him to Dublin. A beautiful\r\ncity--one of the fairest in the United Kingdom. But, its beauty is that\r\nof the fading flower nipped by the untimely frost--the beauty of the\r\nchiseled marble, rather than of the living, acting, speaking man.\r\nConsumptive, pale, listless, it lacks the bloom, the freshness, the\r\nvivacity of conscious health. Its manufactures, its domestic trade, its\r\nforeign commerce, since the union with England, have dwindled under the\r\nshadow of its towering rival beyond the channel, until its market days\r\nare as somber as a London Sabbath. Its dull streets and slumbering\r\nwharves, yea, the very gait and air of its populace, give token that its\r\nprosperity is arrested by the hand of decay, whilst its magnificent\r\npublic edifices seem to stand only as tame and melancholy monuments of\r\nits departed greatness and glory. From the proud capital of an\r\nindependent nation, Dublin has degenerated to the chief mart of a\r\ndependent province, whose owners are \"absentee proprietors,\" whose\r\nhusbandmen pay their rents to foreign landlords, whose merchants are the\r\nmere agents of distant capitalists, and whose nobles are proud to hide\r\ntheir Irish stars under English ribbons.\r\n\r\nEverything in Dublin reminds the Irishman of the captivity of his\r\ncountry. He feels a blighting shame when he conducts a stranger through\r\nthe stately halls of the Bank of Ireland; for there the Lords and\r\nCommons of the Emerald Isle once legislated. He is pained when you extol\r\nthe grandeur of this noble building; for, to his eye, its glory has\r\nfaded and fled. Walk with him through that broad and beautiful avenue,\r\nSackville street, and your praise of its elegant mansions only reminds\r\nhim that the Irish nobility that once resided there have gone to swell\r\nthe brilliant pageant of the conqueror at Hyde Park and St. James's\r\nPalace. Wander with him amidst the filth and squalor of the lanes of the\r\ncity, and he points to wretchedness and want as the fruits of English\r\nlegislation. Go with him to the Castle, and, as the soldiery file\r\nthrough its turreted gate, clad in the uniform of the Saxon, he regards\r\nthem not as the troops of a legitimate ruler, but as the trained\r\nassassins of an alien despot.\r\n\r\nWith such mementoes of the departed power and present captivity of\r\nIreland, meeting his eye at every turn, was it not natural that the\r\ngenuine Irishman, who submitted to the rule of England for the same\r\nreason that the slave wears the chain of his master, should, with the\r\nfree blood which his Creator gave him boiling in his veins, twenty\r\nyears ago present to his oppressor the alternative of civil war or\r\nunqualified toleration in the exercise of his hereditary religious\r\nfaith--that nine years ago he should rush to Conciliation Hall, and\r\nagitate for his civil rights under the motto, \"No People, strong enough\r\nto be a Nation, should consent to be a Province\"--and that in the past\r\nyear, when the last hope of civil emancipation by peaceful means had\r\ndied out, and all Europe was in arms, casting away the chains of ages,\r\nhe should light the fires of revolution on the hights of Tipperary,\r\nresolved to strike one despairing blow for the deliverance of a\r\nlong-oppressed country? He who would brand Washington a traitor, may\r\nsink the iron into the foreheads of Mitchel, O'Brien, and Meagher.\r\n\r\nProminent among the early champions of Catholic Emancipation, stood MR.\r\nGRATTAN. To prove that, for nearly a century past, Ireland has\r\nconstantly exhibited on the floor of the British Commons some of the\r\nmost eloquent men who have swayed the councils of the United Kingdom, I\r\nonly need mention the names of Burke, Flood, Sheridan, Grattan,\r\nPlunkett, O'Connell, and Shiel. Perhaps Canning may be included in the\r\nlist. Both his parents were pure Irish, and he was, as it were,\r\naccidentally born in England. In this galaxy, Grattan shone unrivaled,\r\nexcept by Burke and Canning. He was the equal of the latter in many\r\nrespects--his superior in some. As a practical Parliamentarian, he ranks\r\nscarcely below the former. And he stands at the head of all of his\r\ncountrymen who have been strictly _Irish_ members, representing Irish\r\nconstituencies.\r\n\r\nGraduating at Dublin, and entering the Middle Temple, London, in 1767,\r\nwhen just turned 21, Grattan was an eager observer, from the galleries\r\nof the Lords and Commons, of the fierce struggles of North, Grenville,\r\nChatham, and Burke, then in the zenith of their fame. Throwing Coke and\r\nPlowden on the dusty shelf, he employed his leisure hours in writing\r\nsketches of these \"Battles of the Giants,\" for the perusal of his Irish\r\nfriends. He became enamored of politics, and resolved to shine in the\r\nParliament of his native island. Some of his sketches found their way\r\ninto the Dublin newspapers, and their point and power gave plausibility\r\nto the charge at one time made, that he was the author of Junius. In\r\nanswer to a direct application to him, in 1805, to know if he were the\r\nfamous author, he laconically replied:\r\n\r\n  \"SIR: I am not 'Junius,' but your good wisher and obedient\r\n  servant, HENRY GRATTAN.\"\r\n\r\nOn his permanent return to Ireland, he immediately connected himself\r\nwith the opposition to the Vice-Regal Government, opening the attack by\r\na series of newspaper articles in vindication of Irish rights, which\r\nattracted much attention, and came near subjecting him to a royal\r\nprosecution. From that moment, he gave his whole mind and soul to public\r\naffairs, and, during the subsequent fifty years, every page of Irish\r\nhistory records his name, associated with some measure for the\r\namelioration of Irish wrongs. He is the author of what is miscalled\r\n\"Irish Independence.\" On the accession of George III to the throne, the\r\ngovernment of Ireland was then, as it is now, the chief difficulty of\r\nMinisters. During the American Revolutionary war, intestine commotions,\r\nfrom the incendiary proceedings of the \"Whiteboys,\" (a rabble band which\r\nfired the houses of the landlords, and now and then put to death a\r\nnon-complying tenant,) and the danger of invasion from France, impelled\r\nthe middle classes to petition Government for succor and protection.\r\nThey were frankly told that no aid could be afforded them, and they must\r\ntake care of themselves. Acting on this license, a volunteer militia was\r\nenrolled in all parts of the island, the Government furnishing arms,\r\nwhich swelled till it numbered 100,000 men, of the bone and sinew of\r\nIreland. The \"Whiteboys\" shrunk into the caves, the threatened invasion\r\nwas abandoned, and the popular leaders, who had been active in mustering\r\nthe volunteers, took advantage of their strong position to demand the\r\nremoval of onerous restrictions on Irish commerce, and the amelioration\r\nof the Catholic penal code. The British Government essentially modified\r\nthe commercial regulations between the two countries, and though some of\r\nthe darker features of the code were relaxed, it still remained a\r\ndisgrace to civilization. The greatest burden yet existed--_the\r\nsupremacy of the British Parliament over Irish affairs_. Emboldened by\r\nsuccess, an attempt was made to procure its repeal. Flood, the rival of\r\nGrattan, demanded a distinct disavowal, by the British Parliament, of\r\nthe right to govern Ireland. Grattan, who had the hearts of his\r\ncountrymen in his hand, avowed that he would be satisfied if Britain\r\nwould repeal all existing laws interfering with Irish rights. The\r\nmeasure was adopted, and the Irish Parliament became the supreme\r\nlegislature of Ireland, subject to the supervision of the King in\r\nCouncil. Hibernia was intoxicated with joy, and, in the fervor of their\r\ngratitude, the countrymen of Grattan voted him L50,000. Thus, in 1782,\r\nwas _quasi_ legislative independence granted to Ireland. But British\r\ngold and intrigue were ever able to seduce the integrity and distract\r\nthe counsels of its legislators, till, eighteen years afterward, all was\r\nobliterated in the Act of Union. It was in allusion to the rise and fall\r\nof legislative independence that Grattan, years subsequently, so\r\nbeautifully said, \"I watched its cradle; I followed its bier.\" During\r\nthese eighteen years, he did all that great talents and vigilant\r\npatriotism could to secure the prosperity and save the honor of his\r\nnative land. The leader of the liberals in the Irish Parliament, he\r\nresisted the oppressions of the Saxon, and spurned his bribes, and\r\nappealed to Hibernia to be true to herself, and to maintain her national\r\nidentity. Exasperated beyond endurance, Irish patriotism fomented the\r\nrebellion of 1798-9, which precipitated upon the heads of the \"United\r\nIrishmen\" the whole weight of British hatred and revenge. The scaffold\r\nran blood, and the cheek of Ireland turned pale. In 1799, Pitt proposed\r\nthe Union. Undaunted by the defection around him, Grattan, in the Irish\r\nCommons, resisted it with such vehement eloquence, that it was postponed\r\ntill the next year. In the mean time, British gold proved more potent\r\nthan its bayonets. Half the Irish Parliament was bribed into compliance\r\nwith England's base proposals, and in 1800, after a last effort to rally\r\nthe drooping spirits of his countrymen, Grattan followed the bier of\r\nHibernian Independence to its resting place in St. Stephen's Chapel.\r\nSaid his compatriot, young Emmet, the martyr, about to perish upon the\r\nscaffold, \"When Ireland becomes a nation, let my epitaph be written!\"\r\nForty years afterward, in the midst of an excited throng, in the Dublin\r\nCorn Exchange, I heard O'Connell say, \"Men of Ireland! I swear by your\r\nwrongs that Ireland shall yet become a nation!\" Those wrongs are yet\r\nunavenged, the vow is yet unredeemed, the epitaph unwritten. BUT THEY\r\nWILL BE!\r\n\r\nGrattan entered the British Parliament in 1805, where he remained till\r\nhis death, in 1820. Ever in the front rank of Reformers, he was the\r\nspecial champion of Catholic emancipation, divided the House almost\r\nevery year, and frequently two or three times in a session, on various\r\npropositions looking to ultimate emancipation, but without success; and\r\nin his last effort was defeated by only two majority--an earnest that\r\nthe \"good time\" was coming. He met with the common misfortune of\r\ndispleasing the ultras of both parties. He asked too little to please\r\nthe extreme Catholics--too much to win the favor of the extreme\r\nProtestants. He asked for a part, and got nothing. At a later day,\r\nO'Connell demanded the whole, and got the greater part. History is\r\nphilosophy teaching by examples.\r\n\r\nGrattan was a model orator. His style had the genius, the enthusiasm,\r\nthe brilliancy, the pathos, which mark Hibernian eloquence, and was\r\ndivested of many of those peculiarities which often mar the forensic\r\ndisplays of a country where, as an accomplished Irishman says, \"you may\r\nkick an orator out of every bush.\" If he was fertile in illustrations,\r\nhe was redundant in principles--if his speech was replete with epigram,\r\nit abounded in terse reasoning--if it sparkled with wit, it was luminous\r\nin its calmer statements--if it blighted with its sarcasm, it mellowed\r\nwith its pathos--if it was charged with the lightning of invective, it\r\nwas freighted with the most ponderous argument--if it could wither a\r\ngroveling enemy with its scorn, it could persuade a manly opponent with\r\nits logic. Nor did he overlay the solid parts of his oratory with the\r\nlighter graces of declamation, nor smother them under a redundancy of\r\npoetical illustration. He was a master of the compressed, nervous,\r\nrapid, racy style of argumentation--the very perfection of the art.\r\n\r\nOn the death of this great man, the cause of Catholic emancipation fell\r\nunder the guidance of MR. PLUNKETT, who, next to him, was the ablest\r\nIrish representative in the Commons. Sir James Mackintosh sketches him,\r\nin one of his dashing conversational profiles, thus: \"If Plunkett had\r\ncome earlier into Parliament, so as to have learned the trade, he would\r\nprobably have excelled all our orators. He and Counselor Phillips (or\r\nO'Garish, as he is nicknamed here) are at the opposite points of the\r\nscale. O'Garish's style is pitiful to the last degree. He ought, by\r\ncommon consent, to be driven from the bar.\" Plunkett brought to his work\r\na true Irish heart, talents of the first class, eloquence cast in a rare\r\nmold, and a reputation unsurpassed at the Dublin bar. He bore a\r\nconspicuous part in all those violent throes, in and out of Parliament,\r\nin regard to Catholic emancipation, which convulsed the country from\r\n1820 to 1829, and drove Ireland to the borders of rebellion. He won\r\nseveral partial triumphs over Ministers, preliminary to the granting of\r\nthe great boon in the latter year, when the kingdom held its breath\r\nwhile O'Connell, the dreaded \"Agitator,\" appeared at the bar of the\r\nCommons, to demand his seat for the county of Clare. When the Whigs rose\r\nto power, in 1830, Mr. Plunkett was made Lord Chancellor of Ireland.\r\n\r\nEven this meager notice of the early friends of Catholic emancipation\r\nwould be incomplete without the name of SYDNEY SMITH, the founder of the\r\nEdinburgh Review. Of all English Protestants, out of Parliament, he\r\nrendered the most effective aid to that cause. In six or eight articles\r\nin that influential periodical, in an equal number of speeches and\r\nsermons, and as many pamphlets, he pressed the Catholic claims upon\r\npublic attention during twenty-five years, in a style which no mortal\r\nman but Sydney Smith could do. He did not so much argue the claims of\r\nthe Catholics as ridicule the fears of their opponents. And never were\r\nwit, drollery, humor, irony, and sarcasm, rained down upon a bad cause\r\nin greater variety or rarer quality. He fairly drowned the High Church\r\nparty in their own absurdities. His ten letters, signed Peter Plymley,\r\naddressed to \"My Brother Abraham, who lives in the country,\" are the\r\nvery effervescence of ridicule. They will be read when test acts are\r\nremembered only to be execrated. They will preserve them from the\r\nrottenness of oblivion. They are inimitable--capable of driving the\r\nblues from the cloister of an Archbishop. In the preface to his works,\r\nMr. Smith says: \"I have printed in this collection the letters of Peter\r\nPlymley. The Government of that day took great pains to find out the\r\nauthor. All that they _could_ find was, that they were brought to Mr.\r\nBudd, the publisher, by the Earl of Lauderdale. Somehow or other it came\r\nto be conjectured that I was that author. I have always denied it. But\r\nfinding that I deny it in vain, I have thought it might be as well to\r\ninclude the letters in this collection. They had an immense circulation\r\nat the time, and I think above 20,000 copies were sold.\" This is cool.\r\nBut the letters were _cooler_. They gibbeted the absurd opposition which\r\nhis Episcopal brethren made to emancipation, \"without benefit of\r\nclergy.\" The services of Mersrs O'Connell and Shiel will be noticed in\r\nthe next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n     Catholic Emancipation--Antiquity and Power of the Papal\r\n     Church--Treaty of Limerick--Catholic Penal Code of\r\n     Ireland--Opinions of Penn, Montesquieu, Burke, and Blackstone,\r\n     concerning it--Its Amelioration--Catholic Association of 1823--The\r\n     Hour and the Man--Daniel O'Connell elected for Clare--Alarm in\r\n     Downing Street--Duke of Wellington's Decision--Passage of the\r\n     Emancipation Bill--Services of O'Connell and Shiel--The latter as\r\n     an Orator.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject-matter of this chapter will be, the Catholic Penal Code, and\r\nits repeal by act of Parliament, in 1829.\r\n\r\nThe antiquity and power of the Roman Hierarchy, and the sway it now\r\nholds over 150,000,000 of people, diffused through all quarters of the\r\nglobe, is one of the most extraordinary facts in the history of the\r\nChristian era. Whether the combined efforts of Protestanism to overthrow\r\nit, during the next three centuries, will be more successful than during\r\nthe three since the Reformation, time only can show. In his review of\r\nRanke's History of the Popes, speaking of the Catholic Church, Macaulay\r\nsays: \"She saw the commencement of all the governments, and of all the\r\necclesiastical establishments, that now exist in the world; and we feel\r\nno assurance that she is not destined to see the end of them all. She\r\nwas great and respected before the Saxon had set foot on Britain--before\r\nthe Frank had passed the Rhine--when Grecian eloquence still flourished\r\nat Antioch--when idols were still worshiped in the temple of Mecca. And\r\nshe may still exist in undiminished vigor when some traveler from New\r\nEngland shall, in the midst of a vast solitude, take his stand on a\r\nbroken arch of London Bridge, to sketch the ruins of St. Paul's.\"\r\n\r\nAmongst the adherents to the Papal faith, none have shown a steadier\r\nattachment to it, through all vicissitudes, than the Catholics of\r\nIreland. For centuries it has been the dominant, and at times almost\r\nexclusive, religion of that country. Persecutions the most bigoted and\r\nbloody have not abated the zeal and tenacity with which the Irish have\r\npracticed and clung to their hereditary creed. The battle of the Boyne,\r\nin 1690, was followed by the Treaty of Limerick, by which William of\r\nOrange guaranteed in the most solemn terms religious toleration to his\r\nIrish Catholic subjects. The treaty was to be binding upon him, his\r\nheirs, and successors. But, a fear of the return of the banished\r\nCatholic princes of the house of Stuart, mingled with a propagandist\r\nzeal to convert Ireland to the doctrines of the Reformation, induced\r\nEngland to disregard the stipulations of the Treaty of Limerick. Partly\r\nby the direct legislation of the British Parliament, and partly through\r\nthe medium of the Pale, a _quasi_ Legislature of Ireland, the Catholic\r\nPenal Code was introduced into that country. Like other branches of\r\nBritish law, it was a piece of patchwork, the contribution of many\r\nreigns. It received its worst features within twenty years after the\r\nTreaty of Limerick. I will give a summary of its main provisions.\r\n\r\nFIRST, _as to persons professing the Catholic religion_. No Papist could\r\ntake the real estate of his ancestor, either by descent or purchase; nor\r\npurchase any real estate, nor take a lease for more than thirty-one\r\nyears; and if the profits of such lease exceeded a certain rate, the\r\nland went to any Protestant informer. The conveyance of real estate in\r\ntrust for a Papist was void; nor could he inherit any, nor be in a line\r\nof entail, but the estate descended to the next Protestant heir, as if\r\nthe Papist were dead. A Papist who turned Protestant succeeded to the\r\nfamily estate; and an increase of jointure was allowed to Papist wives\r\non their turning Protestant; whilst, on the other hand, a Protestant\r\nwho turned Papist, or procured another to turn, was guilty of high\r\ntreason. Papist fathers were debarred, on a penalty of L500, from being\r\nguardians of their children; and a Papist minor, who avowed himself a\r\nProtestant, was immediately delivered to a Protestant guardian. No\r\nPapist could marry a Protestant, and the priest celebrating the marriage\r\nwas to be hanged. Papists could not be barristers; and being\r\nProtestants, if they married Papists they were to be treated as Papists.\r\nIt was a felony for a Papist to teach a school; to say or hear mass\r\nsubjected him to fine and a year's imprisonment; to aid in sending\r\nanother abroad, to be educated in the Popish religion, subjected the\r\nparties to a fine, and disabled them to sue in law or equity, to be\r\nexecutors and administrators, to take any legacy or gift, to hold any\r\noffice, and to a forfeiture of all their chattels, and all real estate\r\nfor life. No Papist could hold office, civil or military, sit in\r\nParliament, or vote at elections. Protestants, robbed by privateers in a\r\nwar with a Popish prince were to be indemnified by levies on the\r\nproperty of Catholics alone.\r\n\r\nSECOND, _as to Popish recusants_, i. e., persons not attending the\r\nEstablished Church. Such Papists could hold no office, nor keep arms,\r\nnor come within ten miles of London, on pain of L100, nor travel above\r\nfive miles from home without license, on pain of forfeiting all goods,\r\nnor come to court on pain of L100, nor bring any action at law or\r\nequity; and to marry, baptize, or bury such an one subjected the\r\noffending priest to heavy penalties. A recusant married woman forfeited\r\ntwo-thirds of her dower or jointure, nor could she be the executrix of\r\nher deceased husband, nor have any part of his goods; and during\r\ncoverture she might be imprisoned, unless her husband redeemed her at\r\nthe rate of L10 per month. All other recusant females must renounce\r\nPopery or quit the realm; and if they did not leave in a reasonable\r\ntime, or afterwards returned, they could be put to death.\r\n\r\nTHIRD _as to Popish priests_. Severe penalties were inflicted on them\r\nfor discharging their ecclesiastical functions anywhere, and if done in\r\nEngland they were liable to perpetual imprisonment. Any such priest who\r\nwas born in England, and, having left, should come in from abroad, was\r\nguilty of treason, and all who harbored him might be punished with\r\ndeath. Rewards were given for discovering Popish clergy, and any person\r\nrefusing to disclose what he knew of their saying mass, or teaching\r\npupils, might be imprisoned a year. A Popish priest who turned\r\nProtestant was entitled to L30 per annum. Besides this, they were\r\nsubject to all the penalties and disabilities of lay Papists.\r\n\r\nFOURTH. Papists were excluded from grand juries; in all trials growing\r\nout of the Penal Code, the juries were to be Protestants; and in any\r\ntrial on statutes for strengthening the Protestant interest, a Papist\r\nmight be peremptorily challenged.\r\n\r\nIn surveying the lineaments of such a Code, the blood of a statue might\r\nglow with indignation, or chill with horror. It was inflicted on\r\nCatholic Ireland by Protestant England, in the name of that Church which\r\nclaims to be the pillar and ground of the Christian faith. Well might\r\nthe mild William Penn be aroused to denounce it as inhuman, when\r\npleading before the House of Commons for toleration to the Quakers. Well\r\nmight the sagacious Montesquieu characterize it as cold-blooded tyranny.\r\nWell might the philosophic Burke describe it \"as a machine of wise and\r\nelaborate contrivance, noted for its vicious perfection; and as\r\nadmirably fitted for the oppression, impoverishment, and degradation of\r\na people, and the debasement in them of human nature itself, as ever\r\nproceeded from the perverted ingenuity of man.\" Even Blackstone, who\r\nusually selected his choicest eulogies for the darkest features of the\r\nEnglish law, was forced to say of this Code: \"These laws are seldom\r\nexerted to their utmost rigor; and, indeed, if they were, it would be\r\nvery difficult to excuse them.\" Yes, though in the times when the\r\n\"No-Popery\" cry was at its hight, these laws were rigorously enforced,\r\nyet, as the mellowing light of civilization increased, the more cruel\r\nlay a dead letter on the statute book. But the whole hung over the head\r\nof the Catholic, like the sword of Damocles, ready to drop at the breath\r\nof any persecuting zealot or malicious informer.\r\n\r\nThis Code was essentially ameliorated in 1779, and again in 1793. Among\r\nother concessions, the elective franchise was extended to Catholics,\r\nthough they were still excluded from Parliament. But, he who would bring\r\nhimself within the pale of these ameliorations, must submit to many\r\ndegrading and annoying requisitions, in the form of registrations,\r\noaths, subscriptions, declarations, &c. In a word, down to 1829, when it\r\nwas finally repealed, many of the worst features of the Code remained,\r\nmaking it an offense for seven-eighths of the people of Ireland to\r\nworship God according to the dictates of their consciences; subjecting\r\nthem to degrading tests or heavy penalties for exercising precious civil\r\nand social rights; goading them with a thousand petty and provoking\r\nannoyances, till they had come to be regarded as heathens while bowing\r\nat Christian altars, and aliens to a Government under which they were\r\nborn, and to whose support they were compelled to contribute their blood\r\nin war, and their money in peace. To all this, one may enter his\r\nprotest, while holding at arm's length the Catholic ritual. To worship\r\nGod according to the dictates of his own conscience, without human\r\nmolestation or earthly fear, is the divine right of every man, whether\r\nhe be Irish Catholic or English Protestant, Massachusetts freeman or\r\nLouisiana slave.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the important amendments made in the Catholic Code, in\r\n1779 and 1793, its remaining disabilities and penalties hung over\r\nIreland like a dark cloud, shutting out the sun of civil and religious\r\nfreedom. In the latter year, an association was organized in Dublin, to\r\nagitate and petition for Repeal. Though ultimately rent in pieces by\r\ninternal commotions, it was the germ of all subsequent organizations for\r\nthe same objects. During the succeeding thirty years, this question\r\nfrequently convulsed Parliament and the country. The remedies which the\r\nBritish Government usually prescribed for the political and religious\r\ndiseases of Ireland were insurrection acts, coercion acts, suspensions\r\nof the _habeas corpus_, capital trials, hangings, and transportation,\r\nadministered by the batons of the police and the bayonets of the\r\nsoldiery.\r\n\r\nThe year 1823 saw a bright star of promise arise on the dark and\r\ntroubled horizon of Hibernia. The exigencies of the times had healed the\r\nfeuds of hostile factions among the Emancipationists, and they closed\r\nhands in defense of their common liberties. In May, of that year, Daniel\r\nO'Connell and Richard Lalor Shiel, who had long been estranged from each\r\nother, accidentally met among the mountains of Wicklow, at the house of\r\na friend. A reconciliation took place, and they resolved to form a\r\nleague for the deliverance of their enslaved Catholic countrymen. The\r\nsame month they organized the \"Catholic Association,\" in Dublin, on the\r\nplan of admitting all persons, of whatever sect or party, who approved\r\nits objects. It early enrolled some of the first minds in the island,\r\nwho commenced an agitation which was soon felt in the fartherest corner\r\nof the kingdom, nor stopped till it brought back responses from France,\r\nGermany, the United States, Canada, the East Indies, and other distant\r\ncountries. It made the realm vocal with its orators, crowded Parliament\r\nwith its petitions, and scattered its tracts over the Continent.\r\nO'Connell and Shiel were the life and soul of the Association; the\r\nformer being its chief manager, the latter its most brilliant advocate.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly some of the transactions of this almost omnipotent body were\r\nof an inflammatory character. But it gave concentration and rational aim\r\nto the efforts of the oppressed Irish, and, by exciting the hope of\r\nrelief, withdrew from them the temptation to illegal acts of violence.\r\nThe justice of its object, and the contempt which its petitions received\r\nfrom Parliament, ultimately rallied to its standard the whole of the\r\nCatholics and an influential portion of the dissenting Protestants of\r\nIreland. Alarmed at its power, the session of March, 1825, after a\r\nstormy debate, passed an act terminating its existence. Immediately\r\nafter the adjournment of Parliament, the Association was reoerganized,\r\nwith a constitution which did not come within the law. At the session of\r\n1826, finding that the agitation could not be silenced, various efforts\r\nwere made to ameliorate the condition of Ireland. After spending five\r\nmonths in vehement discussion, Parliament abandoned the country to the\r\nrage of party spirit, and it was left for the well-directed labors of\r\nthe Association to prevent it from plunging into anarchy and revolution.\r\n\r\nAt the general election in the summer of 1826, the friends of\r\nEmancipation took the field and achieved some signal triumphs in\r\nreturning members to Parliament. The Irish tenantry, the \"forty-shilling\r\nfreeholders,\" who had generally been supple instruments in the hands of\r\nthe Protestant landlord, to perpetuate his domination and their chains,\r\nhad, by the labors of the Association, been converted into an engine to\r\noverthrow the oppressors. They now voted with the Emancipators.\r\n\r\nCanning rose to power in 1827. His professed regard for Catholic relief\r\ninduced Ireland to wait and see what would come from his ministry. His\r\nearly death quenched all hope of succor from his administration. After\r\nthe repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts the next year, a struggle\r\nfor partial relief to the Catholics, which resulted successfully in the\r\nCommons, but was defeated in the Lords, only stimulated the friends of\r\nEmancipation to take a bolder step. The hour to strike the decisive blow\r\nhad come, and it brought with it the man.\r\n\r\nIn 1828, Mr. Fitzgerald, the member for Clare, received a place in the\r\ncabinet, thus vacating his seat in the Commons. He was a candidate for\r\nreelection. The Catholic Association requested Mr. O'Connell to become a\r\ncandidate for the vacancy, and in his own person seek to establish the\r\nright of Catholics to sit in Parliament. He immediately issued an\r\naddress to the electors of Clare, in which, among other things, he said:\r\n\"Fellow-countrymen, your county wants a representative. I respectfully\r\nsolicit your suffrages, to raise me to that station. * * * * You will be\r\ntold I am not qualified to be elected. The assertion is untrue. I am\r\nqualified to be elected, and to be your representative. It is true that,\r\nas a Catholic, I cannot, and of course never will, take the oaths at\r\npresent prescribed to members of Parliament. But the authority which\r\ncreated those oaths can abrogate them. And I entertain a confident hope\r\nthat, if you elect me, the most bigoted of our enemies will see the\r\nnecessity of removing from the chosen representative of the people an\r\nobstacle which would prevent him from doing his duty to his king and to\r\nhis country.\"\r\n\r\nThe address fell like a thunderbolt upon the enemies of Emancipation.\r\nThe friends of Fitzgerald would not believe it was the intention of\r\nO'Connell to seriously contest the canvass. The speedy arrival of two of\r\nhis agents in Clare dispelled their doubts. The county was in a boil of\r\nexcitement. The day of election approaches. Shiel addresses a concourse\r\nof electors. His eloquence inspires a wild enthusiasm in their hearts.\r\nThe time for the arrival of the great agitator himself is fixed. An\r\nimmense throng hails him, with banners, music, and shoutings. The trial\r\nday comes, and the candidates appear before assembled thousands of the\r\nelectors. Fitzgerald delivers an able speech. O'Connell rises and\r\npronounces a magnificent harangue, which sways the passions of the\r\npeasantry as forests wave when swept by the wing of the tempest. A\r\nviolent contest ensues, and at its close the high-sheriff declares that\r\n\"Daniel O'Connell, Esq., is duly elected a member of the Commons House\r\nof Parliament for the county of Clare.\"\r\n\r\nThis unexpected result carried dismay into the councils of Downing\r\nstreet; for they knew that O'Connell was soon to appear in London and\r\ndemand his seat in Parliament. His fame was no stranger to the place\r\nwhere his person was unknown. His reputation had long ago penetrated\r\nevery mansion and cabin in the realm. The agitation of the past five\r\nyears, whose tread had shaken Ireland from Cape Clear to the Giant's\r\nCauseway, had ever and anon caused the walls of St. Stephen's to\r\ntremble. And now, what seemed so terrible in the distance, was to be\r\nbrought to its very doors. Parliament was not in session; but it had\r\nbeen announced that ministers would oppose Mr. O'Connell's entrance into\r\nthe Commons. The declaration drove Ireland to the brink of civil war.\r\nThe commander of the forces conveyed to the ministry the alarming\r\nintelligence, that the troops were fraternizing with the people, and\r\ntheir loyalty could not be relied on in the event of an outbreak. All\r\nminds not besotted with bigotry felt that the great right for which the\r\nAssociation had contended must be conceded. The Duke of Wellington, then\r\nat the head of the government, saw that the hour had come when either\r\nhis prejudices or his place must be surrendered. He decided that the\r\nformer must yield. Parliament was convened on the 5th of March, 1829. On\r\nthe first day of the session, Mr. Peel moved that the House go into\r\ncommittee, \"to take into consideration the civil disabilities of his\r\nMajesty's Roman Catholic subjects.\" After two days' debate, it\r\nprevailed. A bill of Emancipation was introduced. Ancient hatred was\r\naroused, and in five days sent in a thousand petitions against its\r\npassage. The bill passed, after a severe struggle, and Mr. Peel carried\r\nit to the Lords. A fierce contest ensued, but it was forced through by\r\nthe Iron Duke. On the 13th of April it received the royal assent, and\r\nwas hailed with joy by the friends of religious freedom, whilst bigotry\r\nwent growling to its den.\r\n\r\nMr. O'Connell appeared in the House to claim his seat. Having been\r\nelected before the act of Emancipation, the ancient oaths were tendered\r\nto him. He declined to take them. After tedious hearings before the\r\nCommittee of Elections, extending through several weeks, and a powerful\r\naddress at the bar of the House in support of his own right, his seat\r\nwas declared vacant. He returned to Ireland, and was everywhere hailed\r\nas \"the Liberator of his country.\" After walking over the course of\r\nClare, he repaired to Westminster, and \"the member for all Ireland\" took\r\nhis seat in the British House of Commons.\r\n\r\nFor this great concession to the Genius of Toleration, the age is\r\nindebted to the Catholic Association, organized and sustained by\r\nO'Connell and Shiel, the Castor and Pollux of Emancipation. No two men\r\nwere more perfect antagonisms in the prime elements of their characters,\r\nand no two more harmoniously blended in the accomplishment of a common\r\nobject. Each supplied what was wanting in the other. O'Connell was\r\nunsurpassed in planning, organizing, and executing, and his unique and\r\nvigorous eloquence could stir to its bottom the ground tier of Irish\r\nsociety. Shiel was rich in the highest gifts of oratory, ornate,\r\nclassical, impassioned, and could rouse the enthusiasm and intoxicate\r\nthe imaginations of the refined classes of his countrymen. The one\r\ncontributed to the work, the learning and skill of an acute lawyer, the\r\nknowledge of a well-read historian of his country, an intimate\r\nacquaintance with all the details of the great question at issue, and\r\nbusiness capacities of the first order. The other gave to it a\r\ntranscendent intellect, adorned with the genius of a poet, the graces of\r\na rhetorician, and the embellishments of a polite scholar. Both\r\nconsecrated to it intense nationality of feeling, quenchless\r\nperseverance, and indomitable courage. Each yielded to the other the\r\nexclusive occupancy of the peculiar field of labor to which his talents\r\nwere best adapted.\r\n\r\nMr. SHIEL was born in 1791. In his youth, he won a high literary\r\nreputation as the author of two tragedies, _Evadne_ and _The Apostate_,\r\nand some beautiful essays in the periodicals. He early acquired an\r\nenviable reputation at the Dublin bar as an advocate. But \"the guage and\r\nmeasure of the man\" were known to a comparatively small circle till his\r\nsplendid oratorical displays in defense of the principles and objects of\r\nthe Catholic Association made his fame coextensive with the empire. The\r\nresult of his services has been recorded. To apply to himself what he so\r\ngraphically said of Grattan, \"The people of Ireland saw the pinnacles of\r\nthe Establishment shattered by the lightning of his eloquence.\" The\r\nEmancipation bill opened to him the doors of Parliament. He entered its\r\nhall in 1831, heralded by a reputation surpassing that with which most\r\norators have been content to leave that field of their triumphs. It is\r\nthe highest proof of the solidity of his reputation, that in this new\r\narena he increased the brilliancy of his fame, being a marked exception\r\nto the rule, that orators who have become famous at the bar, or the\r\nhustings, or on the platform, have failed to meet the public expectation\r\non encountering the severer tests of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago I heard Mr. Shiel deliver a speech in Parliament, and\r\nI retain a vivid impression of his powers. He seemed the very embodiment\r\nof all that was gorgeous and beautiful in the arts of rhetoric and\r\noratory. His sentences rushed forth with the velocity of a mountain\r\ntorrent, while for an hour and a half he poured down upon the House a\r\nceaseless shower of metaphor, simile, declamation, and appeal, lighted\r\nwith the brilliant flashes of wit, and mingled with the glittering hail\r\nof sarcasm. He belongs not to the best school of oratory, but is master\r\nof that in which he was trained. There is no rant or fustian in his\r\nspeeches, for they are eminently intellectual. Though polished in the\r\nextreme, they are pure ore, and sparkle with real gems. His ornaments\r\nare lavishly put on, but are never selected from the tinsel and mock\r\ndiamond mine. His defect is, that he too much discards logic, and revels\r\nin rhetoric. In discussing even an appropriation bill, his figures are\r\ndrawn less from the annual budget of the Chancellor of the Exchequer\r\nthan from the perennial springs of Helicon. He aims to reach the heart,\r\nnot through the reason, but the reason and the heart through the\r\nimagination. While his oratory lacks the logical power and majestic\r\nstrength which bear aloft the poetic imagery and affluent illustration\r\nof Choate, it partakes largely of those embellishments that give\r\nbrilliancy and grace to the eloquence of our distinguished countryman.\r\nHe is no more like Brougham or Webster, than a dashing charge of Murat\r\nat the head of his cavalry is like a steady fire from a park of\r\nartillery.\r\n\r\nAs a specimen of his oratory, I subjoin an extract from one of his\r\nspeeches. In 1837, Lord Lyndhurst declared, in the Upper House, that the\r\nIrish were \"aliens in blood and religion.\" Shortly after, Mr. Shiel thus\r\nrepelled the charge in the Commons. Lord L. was a listener.\r\n\r\n\"Where was Arthur, Duke of Wellington, when those words were uttered?\r\nMethinks he should have started up to disclaim them.\r\n\r\n  \"'The battles, sieges, fortunes that he passed'\r\n\r\nought to have come back upon him. He ought to have remembered that, from\r\nthe earliest achievement in which he displayed that military genius\r\nwhich has placed him foremost in the annals of modern warfare, down to\r\nthat last and surpassing combat which has made his name\r\nimperishable--from Assaye to Waterloo--the Irish soldiers, with whom\r\nyour armies were filled, were the inseparable auxiliaries to the glory\r\nwith which his unparalleled successes have been crowned. Whose were the\r\nathletic arms that drove your bayonets at Vimiera through the phalanxes\r\nthat never reeled in the shock of war before? What desperate valor\r\nclimbed the steeps and filled the moats of Badajos? All, all his\r\nvictories should have rushed and crowded back upon his memory: Vimiera,\r\nBadajos, Salamanca, Abuera, Toulouse--and, last of all, the greatest.\r\nTell me, for you were there--I appeal to the gallant soldier before me,\r\n(pointing to Sir Henry Hardinge,) who bears, I know, a generous heart in\r\nan intrepid breast--tell me, for you must needs remember, on that day\r\nwhen the destinies of mankind were trembling in the balance; while death\r\nfell in showers upon them; when the artillery of France, leveled with\r\nthe precision of the most deadly science, played upon them; when her\r\nlegions, incited by the voice, inspired by the example of their mighty\r\nleader, rushed again and again to the contest; tell me if for an\r\ninstant, when to hesitate for an instant was to be lost, the 'aliens'\r\nblanched? And when, at length, the moment for the last decisive movement\r\nhad arrived; when the valor, so long wisely checked, was at last let\r\nloose; when, with words familiar but immortal, the great captain\r\nexclaimed, 'Up, lads, and at them!'--tell me if Catholic Ireland with\r\nless heroic valor than the natives of your own glorious isle\r\nprecipitated herself upon the foe! The blood of England, Scotland,\r\nIreland, flowed in the same stream, on the same field. When the chill\r\nmorning dawned, their dead lay cold and stark together. In the same deep\r\npit their bodies were deposited. The green spring is now breaking on\r\ntheir commingled dust. The dew falls from heaven upon their union in the\r\ngrave. Partakers in every peril, in the glory shall we not participate?\r\nAnd shall we be told, as a requital, that we are estranged from the\r\nnoble country for whose salvation our life-blood was poured out?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThough approaching the verge of good taste, conceive of the present\r\neffect of such an outburst gushing from the lips of Shiel, the\r\nperspiration standing in drops on his knotted locks, his eye kindled\r\nwith Milesian fire, every feature of his expressive countenance instinct\r\nwith passion, every limb of his small but symmetrical frame trembling\r\nwith emotion, his shrill but musical voice barbing every emphatic word!\r\n\r\nSince he entered Parliament, Mr. Shiel has acted with the liberal Whigs,\r\nhas held office under Lord John Russell, and generally declined the lead\r\nof Mr. O'Connell. He stood aloof from the Repeal agitation, though he\r\ndefended O'Connell, when on trial for Conspiracy some four years ago,\r\nwith the ability and eloquence of his brightest days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n     Movements toward Parliamentary Reform--John Cartwright--The Father\r\n     of Parliamentary Reform--His Account of the Trials of Hardy and\r\n     Tooke--Lord Byron's Eulogium of him--His Opinions of the Slave\r\n     Trade--The First English Advocate of the Ballot--His Conviction for\r\n     Conspiracy--His Labors for Grecian and Mexican\r\n     Independence--William Cobbett--His Character, Opinions, and\r\n     Services--His Style of Writing--His Great Influence with the\r\n     Middling and Lower Orders of England--Sir Francis Burdett--His\r\n     Labors for Reform--His Recantation.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrant to the people of England universal suffrage and equal\r\nParliamentary representation, and all other reforms will ultimately\r\nfollow. The present century has taught the masses and the statesmen of\r\nthat country, that, to wield influence over its Government, it is not\r\nnecessary to occupy official stations. I am about to note some\r\noccurrences in the life of one who taught and illustrated the truth,\r\nthat power and place are not synonymous terms--one who exerted much sway\r\nover public affairs for fifty years, one whose services were wholly of a\r\npopular character, he never having held office. I allude to JOHN\r\nCARTWRIGHT. His name is appropriately introduced previous to noticing\r\nthe passage of the Reform Bill, for, no man did more than he to create a\r\npublic opinion which demanded that great measure. By universal consent\r\nhe was called \"THE FATHER OF PARLIAMENTARY REFORM.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cartwright was born in 1740. He entered the navy as a midshipman,\r\nsaw a great deal of hard fighting, reached the post of first lieutenant,\r\nbecame distinguished for his science and skill in the service, and at\r\nthe age of thirty-four abandoned the seas, and turned his mind to\r\npolitics. In 1774, he published _Letters on American Independence_,\r\naddressed to the House of Commons, in which he took radical ground in\r\nfavor of the rights of the Colonies. \"It is a capital error,\" says he,\r\n\"in the reasonings of most writers on this subject, (the rights of man,)\r\nthat they consider the liberty of mankind in the same light as an estate\r\nor chattel, and go about to prove or disapprove the right to it, by\r\ngrants, usage, or municipal statutes. It is not among moldy parchments\r\nthat we are to look for it; it is the immediate gift of God; it is not\r\nderived from any one, but it is original in every one.\" Here we have the\r\npioneer idea of our own Declaration of Independence, uttered by an\r\nunknown Englishman two years before that immortal paper saw the light.\r\nIn 1776, an event occurred which put Major Cartwright's principles (he\r\nhad been appointed major in the Nottinghamshire militia) to a severe\r\ntest. He was always proud of the navy, and ambitious of promotion in the\r\nservice. Lord Howe, who had witnessed his courage and skill, having\r\ntaken command of the fleet to act against the American Colonies, urged\r\nCartwright to take a captaincy of a line-of-battle ship. He was then\r\npaying his addresses to a lady of high family, whose friends would\r\nconsent to her accepting his hand if he would accede to the proposal of\r\nLord Howe. He declined, thereby losing the favor both of Mars and Hymen.\r\nThis led to an acquaintance with the gallant Lord Effingham, an officer\r\nof the army, who proved himself a genuine nobleman by resigning his\r\ncommission rather than act against \"the rebels.\"\r\n\r\nCartwright now (1776) commenced the work to which he devoted the\r\nremaining years of his laborious and useful life--_Parliamentary\r\nReform_. At the outset, he took the ground now occupied by the\r\nChartists. In his first two pamphlets--and they were the earliest\r\nEnglish productions on reform in the House of Commons--he maintained\r\nthat equal representation, universal suffrage, and annual elections,\r\nwere rights inherent in the body of the people. His system closely\r\nresembled that engrafted upon the United States Constitution twelve\r\nyears later. This shows him a man of rare sagacity for the times, far in\r\nadvance of his cotemporaries, and not a whit behind the most radical\r\nAmerican patriots. The next year he presented an address to the King,\r\nurging peace with his Colonies, and a union with them on the basis of\r\nindependent States. He organized, the same year, England's first\r\nassociation for promoting Parliamentary reform, called the \"Society for\r\nPolitical Inquiry.\" Soon after, Cartwright stood twice for Parliament,\r\nbut was unsuccessful, partly on account of his radical principles, and\r\npartly because he would not stoop to any form of bribery, not even\r\n\"treating,\" declaring that \"he would not spend a single shilling to\r\ninfluence the electors.\"\r\n\r\nHe continued to agitate for reform, by pamphlets, speeches, and\r\ncorrespondence, till, in 1781, he organized the celebrated \"Society for\r\nConstitutional Information,\" which enrolled many of the first names in\r\nthe kingdom, and to which Tooke belonged when tried for treason in 1794.\r\nCartwright wrote the first address of the Society. It received the high\r\nencomiums of Sir William Jones, who said it ought to be engraven upon\r\ngold. The ship of Parliamentary Reform now glided smoothly, Cartwright\r\nbeing the chief pilot, when the French revolution burst upon the world.\r\nHe hailed it as the dawn of a political millennium, and, filled with\r\njoy, he addressed a congratulatory and advisory letter to the French\r\nNational Assembly. But, the skies of France, so bright at the rising of\r\nthe revolutionary sun, soon became darkened, and the clouds poured down\r\nblood and fire upon the land, covering the friends of liberty in England\r\nwith sorrow and dismay. The Reign of Terror in France was followed by a\r\nReign of Terror in England. In the former, the victims were royalists.\r\nIn the latter, radicals. In the former, Robespierre and the guillotine\r\nexecuted vengeance. In the latter, George III and the Court of King's\r\nBench. Large numbers erased their names from the proscribed roll of the\r\nSociety. Cartwright, Tooke, and a resolute band, resolved to stand by\r\ntheir principles and pledges, and brave the royal anger, come life, come\r\ndeath. The particulars of the treason trials which followed, I have\r\nalready given.\r\n\r\nSome of Cartwright's friends besought him to stand aloof from Tooke and\r\nhis \"brother traitors.\" He was too brave and true a man to desert his\r\nassociates in the ordeal hour. He addressed a letter to the Secretary of\r\nState, asking permission to visit Tooke in the Tower, avowing that it\r\nhad been the greatest pleasure of his life to cooperate with him for\r\nParliamentary reform; and if his friend was a felon, and worthy of\r\ndeath, so was he. He has left interesting memoranda of the trials at the\r\nOld Bailey. He says, \"Gibbs spoke like an angel\" in Hardy's case, and\r\nthat Erskine became so exhausted, toward the close of the trial, that,\r\nin arguing incidental points to the court, an intermediate person had to\r\nrepeat what he said to the judges. He conveyed intelligence of the\r\nresult of Hardy's case to his family in the country, in terms as terse\r\nas Caesar's celebrated military dispatch: \"_Hardy is acquitted.--J. C._\"\r\nHe was a witness in Tooke's case. On the cross-examination of the\r\nAttorney General, though cautioned by the court not to criminate\r\nhimself, he scorned all concealment, avowing that the objects of the\r\nConstitutional Society were to obtain equal representation, universal\r\nsuffrage, and annual Parliaments, and replying to the caution of the\r\njudges, that \"he came there not to state what was prudent, but what was\r\ntrue.\" When questioned about some expressions of his, as to \"strangling\r\nthe vipers aristocracy and monarchy,\" he said he had no recollection of\r\nusing the terms, but, if he had, and they were applied to aristocracies\r\nand monarchies hostile to liberty, he thought them well deserved. He\r\nsays Tooke grappled with the prosecuting counsel with the strength and\r\ncourage of a lion. When a paper was produced, and Tooke was asked to\r\nadmit his handwriting, the Chief Justice cautioned him not to do so\r\nhastily. Turning to his Lordship, he said, \"I protest, before God, that\r\nI have never done an action, never written a sentence, in public or\r\nprivate, never entertained a thought on any political subject, which,\r\ntaken fairly, with all the circumstances of time, occasion, and place, I\r\nhave the smallest hesitation to admit.\" How the stout-hearted integrity\r\nof such men, in such a trying hour, puts to eternal shame the servile\r\ntricks and fawning arts of the common scum of office-hunting\r\npoliticians.\r\n\r\nThe treason trials of 1794 being over, Cartwright resumed his work, and\r\nfor some eight years seems to have been the only active man of character\r\nand standing in the enterprise--the others having cowered before the\r\npersecuting spirit of the times. In 1802, a ludicrous occurrence showed\r\nthe suspicious state of the Governmental mind. The Major had a brother,\r\nDr. George Cartwright, who was celebrated as a mechanician, being the\r\ninventor of the power-loom, and other valuable machines. He had taken\r\nout patents for them--these had been extensively infringed--and he had\r\ncommenced suits against the violators. The Major was assisting him in\r\nprocuring evidence; and for that purpose he had dispatched an agent to\r\nYorkshire, with a letter of instructions, which had a good deal to say\r\nabout _levers_, _cranks_, _rollers_, and _screws_. The messenger was\r\narrested as a joint conspirator with the Major for the overthrow of his\r\nMajesty's Government, by means of some \"infernal machine\"--the phrases\r\nin the letter being interpreted to cover a dark design to \"put the\r\nscrews\" on the King. Ascertaining that his agent was in _limbo_,\r\nCartwright wrote to the Attorney General, offering to explain the\r\nmatter. The Crown officer was not to be caught so. Indict and hang the\r\nconspirator he would, in spite of power-looms and militia majors. At\r\nlength the facts became known, and the astute Attorney was glad to back\r\nout of the ridiculous scrape by an apologetic letter to the parties.\r\n\r\nIt would require a volume to record all that our patriot did for\r\nParliamentary reform from 1804, when it had a limited revival, till\r\n1824, when he died. Though he was sixty-four years old at the\r\ncommencement of this period, and eighty-four at its close, he did more\r\nduring these twenty years to procure for Englishmen their electoral\r\nrights, than any other ten persons in the kingdom. He published scores\r\nof pamphlets, written in a style, bold, lucid, and going to the roots of\r\nthe controversy; convened hundreds of meetings in all parts of the\r\ncountry, to which he addressed able speeches; sent thousands of\r\npetitions to Parliament; formed numerous societies; and conducted a\r\nnever flagging correspondence with the leading friends of liberty and\r\nreform. In 1810, he sold his farm and removed to London, that \"he might\r\nbe near his work.\" Brave old heart of oak, of threescore years and ten!\r\nThe next year, thirty-eight persons were seized at Manchester while\r\nattending a reform meeting, and sent fifty miles to prison, on a charge\r\nof sedition. Cartwright went down to aid in preparing their defense and\r\nattend the examination. Having procured their release, he took a\r\ncircuitous route home, getting up meetings and petitions on the tour. He\r\nwas arrested, taken before a magistrate, his papers and person searched,\r\nwhen, finding nothing worthy of death or bonds upon him, he was\r\ndischarged. Vainly endeavoring to obtain a copy of the warrant on which\r\nhe was arrested, he subsequently presented the case by petition to the\r\nHouse of Peers. Lord Byron, the poet, in supporting the petition, said\r\nof him: \"He is a man, my lords, whose long life has been spent in one\r\nunceasing struggle for the liberty of the subject, against that undue\r\ninfluence of the Crown which has increased, is increasing, and ought to\r\nbe diminished; and, whatever difference of opinion may exist as to his\r\npolitical tenets, few will be found to question the integrity of his\r\nintentions. Even now, oppressed with years, and not exempt from the\r\ninfirmities attendant on age, but unimpaired in talent, and unshaken in\r\nspirit, _frangas_, _non flectes_, he has received many a wound in the\r\ncombat against corruption; and the new grievance, the fresh insult, of\r\nwhich he now complains, may inflict another scar, but no dishonor.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1814, he addressed a series of letters to Clarkson on the slave\r\ntrade--he having taken an active part in the contest for its\r\nabolition--in which he argued that it should be punished as piracy, a\r\ndoctrine which he was the first to broach. He also wrote against bribery\r\nat elections, and in favor of voting by ballot, being the first English\r\nadvocate of that measure. A year or two after this, a mercenary widow of\r\none of his old Scotch correspondents wrote to him that the Government\r\nhad offered her a large sum if she would give up his letters--adding,\r\nsignificantly, that the circumstances of her family were such, that she\r\nthought she should comply with the offer. He extinguished her hopes of\r\nextorting money from him by informing her, that \"it gave him great\r\nsatisfaction to find that any of his letters were esteemed so valuable,\r\nand begged her to make the best bargain she could of their contents.\" In\r\n1816, the great number and imposing character of the demonstrations in\r\nfavor of Parliamentary reform alarmed the Government. Canning, in the\r\nHouse of Commons, denounced Cartwright as \"that old heart in London,\r\nfrom which the veins of sedition in the country are supplied.\" The\r\nkingdom was in a flame--the _habeas corpus_ act was suspended--and the\r\n\"Six Acts,\" aimed at the Irish Catholic associations, and the English\r\nreform meetings, were adopted. Cobbett, the editor of the Register, fled\r\nto America. Others left their ears on the pillory at home, or carried\r\nthem at the request of the Government to Botany Bay. Cartwright, who\r\nnever flinched from friend or foe, stood his ground, and contrived new\r\nmodes to keep up the agitation, evading the recent law against\r\n\"tumultuous petitioning,\" by getting up _petitions of twenties_, and in\r\nvarious ways avoiding the prohibitions of the \"Six Acts.\"\r\n\r\nSo far, he had kept out of the fangs of the law, excepting in the affair\r\nof searching his person. But, the Attorney General had his eye upon him.\r\nIn 1819, he participated in the famous Birmingham proceedings, which\r\nresulted in the appointment, on his suggestion, of a \"Legislatorial\r\nAttorney\" for the town, who was to present a letter to the Speaker of\r\nthe Commons, as its representative. This measure of \"sending a petition\r\nin the form of a living man, instead of one on parchment,\" as he called\r\nit, precipitated the long-expected crisis. He was indicted for\r\nconspiracy and sedition, in Warwickshire. So soon as he heard of it, he\r\nset off by post to meet the charge, traveling one hundred miles in a\r\nsingle day, though then bowed down with the weight of fourscore years.\r\nPutting in bail, he returned to London, and resumed his work. Soon\r\nafter, he presided at a reform meeting, drew up a petition, couched in\r\nthe most energetic terms, signed it, sent it to the Commons, and then\r\nset about exposing the attempts of the Crown officers to pack the jury\r\nwhich was to try him. The trial took place in August, 1820. He called no\r\nwitnesses; addressed the jury mainly in defense of his principles; was\r\nconvicted; was not called up for sentence till the next May; when the\r\njudge, after eulogizing his general character, condemned him to pay a\r\nfine of L100, and stand committed till it was paid. He immediately\r\npulled out a canvass bag, counted down the money in gold, slily\r\nremarking to the sheriff, that they were all \"_good sovereigns_.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the heroic struggles of Greece, South America, and Mexico,\r\nresounded through Europe, they had no more attentive listener than Major\r\nCartwright. Seizing his never-idle pen, he wrote \"Hints to the\r\nGreeks\"--a letter to the President of the Greek Congress--and another to\r\nthe Greek Deputies. About the same time, he opened his doors to two of\r\nthe liberal leaders in the Spanish Revolution, who had sought refuge in\r\nEngland. His sun was now declining. He had attended his last reform\r\nmeeting in 1823; he wrote his last political pamphlet in 1824. In July\r\nof this year, he received a letter from Mr. Jefferson, who said, \"Your\r\nage of eighty-four and mine of eighty-one years, insure us a speedy\r\nmeeting; we may then commune at leisure on the good and evil which, in\r\nthe course of our long lives, we have both witnessed.\" He had taken a\r\ndeep interest in the Mexican struggles for liberty, and frequently\r\nconferred with General Michelena, its envoy then in London, upon its\r\naffairs. On the 21st of September, 1824, the General sent to inform him\r\nthat the scheme of Iturbide had failed, and that the liberty of Mexico\r\nmight be considered as established. Two days afterward, \"the father of\r\nParliamentary reform\" died, retaining his faculties and his fervent love\r\nof freedom to the last. He cheerfully resigned himself into the hands of\r\nhis Maker, exclaiming, \"God's will be done!\"\r\n\r\nAmong the remarkable men who, like Cartwright, helped to prepare the\r\npublic mind for the Reform Bill, and like him illustrated the truth,\r\nthat power and place are not necessarily synonymous terms, is WILLIAM\r\nCOBBETT, whom the \"Corn-law Rhymer\" calls England's\r\n\r\n  \"Mightiest peasant-born.\"\r\n\r\nHis name is familiar on both sides of the Atlantic, and is much mixed up\r\nwith good and evil report. He was no negation or neutral, but a man of\r\nmark, that left his impress on the age. He was not only one of the most\r\nvoluminous, but one of the boldest and most powerful writers of the\r\npresent century. Ever in the thickest of the strife, his \"peasant arm\"\r\ndealt goodly blows in the contests of the People with the Crown, during\r\nthe last thirty years of his turbulent life. Cobbett was born in 1762.\r\nHis father was a poor yeoman, who brought his son up to hard work and\r\nTory principles. He never went to school, but was literally self-taught,\r\nlearning even the alphabet without a teacher. He says: \"I learned\r\ngrammar when I was a private soldier on the pay of sixpence per day.\"\r\nHaving committed Lowth's Grammar to heart, he used to make it a rule to\r\nrecite it through from memory every time he stood sentry. He enlisted in\r\nthe army when he was twenty-one, and served eight years in the British\r\nAmerican colonies. He was discharged, returned to England, married, made\r\na short tour in France, whence he embarked for the United States,\r\narriving in New York in 1792. He was a violent Tory--joined the\r\nanti-French party--commenced publishing--attacked with ferocity\r\nPriestley, Franklin, Rush, Jefferson, Dallas, Monroe, Gallatin, Fox,\r\nSheridan, Bonaparte, Talleyrand, and a score of other great men--was\r\narrested, and compelled to give bail in a heavy sum for his good\r\nbehavior--was sued for a libel by Dr. Rush, who recovered five thousand\r\ndollars damages--fled from Philadelphia to New York, where the execution\r\novertook him--was thrown into prison--the judgment was paid by his\r\nadmirers--he left the country, and arrived in England in 1801. While in\r\nAmerica, he wrote under the name of \"Peter Porcupine,\" and on his return\r\nto England published his writings in twelve volumes. They had a large\r\ncirculation among the Anti-Jacobins, who received him with open arms. He\r\nhad previously sent an account of his trans-Atlantic \"persecutions\" to\r\nthe \"Loyal Society\" of London, \"to be used as a panacea for the\r\nreformists, and the whole gang of liberty-men in England.\"\r\n\r\nHe started a paper in London in 1801, called \"The Porcupine,\" which\r\nsupported Pitt and the Tories, and attacked Fox and the Whigs, much\r\nafter the style of his Philadelphia writings. He suspended the\r\npublication of \"The Porcupine,\" and commenced his celebrated \"Weekly\r\nPolitical Register\" in 1802, which he continued till his death, a period\r\nof thirty-three years. This journal has given him an enduring name among\r\nthe political writers of his times. For two or three years, it advocated\r\nHigh Toryism. Wyndham was enamored of it, and stated in the House of\r\nCommons, that its editor deserved a statue of gold. Wyndham promised to\r\nintroduce Cobbett to Pitt. The latter declined to see him. The editor\r\nwas deeply mortified at this rebuff of the aristocratic minister.\r\nImmediately thereafter, and probably _therefore_, Cobbett changed his\r\npolitics, and from a high Church and King man, turned to be a radical\r\nreformer and champion of the people. The first public demonstration of\r\nthe somerset was a violent philippic against the Irish Tory\r\nadministration. He was prosecuted for libels, both at London and Dublin,\r\non the Lord Lieutenant, Chancellor, Chief Justice, and Under Secretary\r\nfor Ireland, and was fined a thousand pounds. This prosecution only\r\nstimulated his new-born zeal for liberalism. He sharpened his weapons,\r\nand plunged them into the bowels of his old friends as vigorously as he\r\nhad before done into those of their enemies, sparing neither Church nor\r\nState, Ministry nor King. The Register soon became the terror of\r\nevil-doers. Its denunciations of profligate statesmen and rotten\r\ninstitutions were so bold and hearty, and its columns breathed such an\r\nair of defiant independence, that it was sought for with avidity by the\r\nradicals of the middling and lower orders, and the income as well as the\r\nfame of its editor became largely increased.\r\n\r\nBut Cobbett never could sail long in smooth water. Like the petrel, he\r\nloved the storm. In 1810, he was prosecuted for a libel on the\r\nGovernment, contained in an article reflecting in indignant terms on the\r\nbrutal flogging of a company of the local militia, under the\r\n_surveillance_ of a regiment of German mercenaries. He defended himself,\r\nwas convicted, and sentenced to pay a fine of one thousand pounds, be\r\nimprisoned two years, and give sureties for his good behavior for seven\r\nyears in five thousand pounds. He never forgot or forgave this injury.\r\nTwo other prosecutions of editors grew out of the same transaction. They\r\nwere defended by Brougham in two splendid speeches, which introduced the\r\nrising barrister to a first place among the forensic orators of the\r\nkingdom. The circulation of the Register had increased steadily from\r\nyear to year; and soon after this trial, Cobbett continuing to edit it\r\nwhile in prison, it reached an unprecedented sale, some weeks numbering\r\none hundred thousand copies. Its vigorous assaults on the Government\r\nconspired with the other reform movements of the times to cause the\r\nrepeal of the _habeas corpus_, and the passage of the infamous \"six\r\nacts,\" by which the ministry hoped to crush the agitators. To avoid the\r\nblow aimed at him, Cobbett fled to America early in 1817, where he\r\nremained nearly three years. He regularly remitted \"copy\" across the\r\nAtlantic for the Register, which continued a pungent thorn in the side\r\nof Castlereagh and his friends, though the hand which wielded it was\r\nthree thousand miles away.\r\n\r\nReturning to England in 1820, he established a daily paper, which\r\nfailed--tried to introduce the cultivation of Indian corn into the\r\ncountry, which failed--stood a candidate for Parliament for Coventry,\r\nand failed--defended himself against two prosecutions for libel, and\r\nfailed, paying fines to the amount of nearly two thousand\r\npounds--plunged into the Queen Caroline controversy with his brother\r\nliberals, and did _not_ fail--advocated Catholic emancipation, and saw\r\nit succeed--made an attempt to enter Parliament for Preston, and was\r\ndefeated--took an active part in all the agitations for Parliamentary\r\nreform--defended himself in a speech of six hours against a prosecution\r\nfor sedition, growing out of an article in the Register in favor of the\r\nReform Bill, the jury being discharged because they could not agree--and\r\nfinally was reprimanded by the Speaker, for giving three cheers in the\r\ngallery of the Commons, when the bill passed the House. In 1832, he\r\nreached the acme of his ambition, by being returned to the first\r\nreformed Parliament for the borough of Oldham. But it is a rare tree\r\nthat will bear transplanting in the sere and yellow leaf of advanced\r\nage. Cobbett was threescore years and ten when he took his seat in the\r\nHouse of Commons. Though he made a few vigorous speeches, he did not\r\nfulfill the expectations of his friends, nor exhibit the power and\r\noriginality in debate which the public anticipated from the editor of\r\nthe Political Register. He closed his stormy life in 1835.\r\n\r\nCobbett has been called \"a bold, bad man.\" Bold he was; but, he was not\r\nas bad as the times in which he lived, nor the institutions he\r\nassailed. He was a man to be feared rather than loved--to be admired\r\nrather than trusted. But he was a MAN, \"for a' that.\" He never croaked\r\nor _canted_--never whined or repined--was proud, self-willed,\r\nself-reliant--knew his strength, and asked no favors and showed no\r\nquarter. His idiosyncrasies, his egotism, his self-dependence, rendered\r\nit next to impossible for anybody to work with him even to attain a\r\ncommon end. He was the victim of prejudice, conceit, passion, and seemed\r\nnot to advocate a cause so much from love of it, as from hatred of its\r\nopposite. He bent his great energies to tear down existing institutions,\r\nwhilst he lent but feeble aid in building up others in their place. He\r\nhated all that was above him in birth and station, and his appeals\r\nusually being to the prejudices and passions of the class from which he\r\nsprang, he wielded a vast influence over the common people of England.\r\nThey were proud of his attainments, because they regarded him as one of\r\nthemselves, who had risen, by his own strength, to a commanding position\r\namong the leaders of public opinion, and they witnessed with pride his\r\nability to grapple with and hurl to the earth, the titled champions of\r\nthe privileged orders. Thus, more than any other writer, he was, for\r\nthirty years, looked up to as the representative, the oracle, of the\r\n\"base born\" of his countrymen. It contributed not a little to his\r\ninfluence with the ground tier of British society, that he was a\r\npractical farmer, in a moderate way--the great sale of his writings\r\naffording him the means of gratifying his cultivated tastes for\r\nagricultural pursuits. Taking it for granted that established systems,\r\nopinions, and institutions, were necessarily wrong, he attacked\r\neverything that was old, and everybody that was popular. He avowed that\r\nhe attacked Dr. Rush's system of medical practice, because it originated\r\nwith a republican--he called Washington \"a notorious rebel and\r\ntraitor\"--nicknamed Franklin \"Old Lightning-rod\"--denounced Lafayette as\r\n\"a citizen-miscreant\"--and abused Jefferson because he was a popular\r\ndemocrat. But this was in the days of his toryism. However, when a\r\nradical, he showered ridicule on Shakspeare, Milton, and Scott, because\r\nall the _literati_ praised them, and eulogized O'Connell, because all\r\nEnglishmen anathematized him.\r\n\r\nBut, the objects of his assaults were not always so undeserving of it,\r\nnor so ill assorted. He exposed the land monopoly of England, and\r\nvindicated the rights and dignity of labor--he laid bare the rapacity of\r\nthe Established Church, and maintained the rights of Catholics and\r\ndissenters--he denounced the game laws, the corn laws, and the penal\r\ncode--he advocated the abolition of the House of Lords, and the\r\nbestowment of universal suffrage upon the people. It was impossible for\r\na man of such giant powers and rooted prejudices, who had received the\r\niron of persecution so often in his own person, and who was always in\r\nthe thickest of the fray, to speak calmly or with measured words.\r\nConsequently, his writings abound in malevolent epithets, unmitigated\r\nvituperation, and coarse ridicule of men and measures. So do they abound\r\nin right good sense, cogent reasonings, elevated appeals to justice and\r\nhumanity, interspersed with racy humor, graphic descriptions, happy\r\nillustrations, and lively anecdotes. The basis of his style was the old\r\nSaxon tongue, and it was as idiomatic and lucid as that of Franklin or\r\nPaley. He wrote on numerous subjects besides politics; and, in addition\r\nto the eighty-eight volumes of the Register, and the twelve of his Peter\r\nPorcupine, he put to press nearly fifty volumes. He was kind to his\r\nfamily, hospitable to the poor, and had a great deal of sunshine in his\r\nsoul. He will be gratefully remembered by enfranchised Englishmen, when\r\nmilder and meaner men, who affected to look down upon him with contempt,\r\nare forgotten, or are recollected only to be despised.\r\n\r\nI close this notice of the great English peasant, by quoting the closing\r\nstanza of a beautiful tribute to his memory, by Ebenezer Elliott, the\r\nauthor of \"Corn Law Rhymes.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Dead Oak, thou liv'st. Thy smitten hands.\r\n    The thunder of thy brow,\r\n  Speak with strange tongues in many lands,\r\n    And tyrants hear thee now!\"\r\n\r\nSir FRANCIS BURDETT has been mentioned as a friend of Parliamentary\r\nReform. Few Englishmen did more for the cause than this bold advocate of\r\nliberal principles. Few titled Reformers have suffered more for\r\nopinion's sake than he. It was his good or bad fortune to be frequently\r\ncaught in the net of legal prosecution. In 1809, Sir Francis then being\r\na member of Parliament, a Mr. John Gale Jones, whose name would never\r\nhave got beyond his shop had it not become associated with that of\r\nBurdett, published a handbill animadverting, in terms of clumsy abuse,\r\nupon some proceedings of the House of Commons; whereupon, that body of\r\nhonorables committed him to Newgate. Sir Francis brought forward a\r\nmotion for his liberation, based on the ground that the House had no\r\nright to imprison him for such an offense. Being defeated, he published\r\nan address to his constituents, in which he applied some contemptuous\r\nepithets to this contemptible proceeding. A furious debate sprang up,\r\nwhich terminated in a resolution to commit Burdett to the Tower. The\r\nSergeant-at-Arms went to his house with the warrant of committal, but\r\nSir Francis refused to accompany him to his new abode. The next day he\r\nrepeated his visit; but by this time the populace had assembled in great\r\nnumbers around the dwelling of the Baronet, and drove away the officer.\r\nEarly the following morning, he broke into his apartments, seized\r\nBurdett, put him into a carriage, and bore him to the Tower, accompanied\r\nby several regiments of dragoons, where he remained in close confinement\r\ntill the end of the session. The day of his release, all London was out\r\nof doors, and he was welcomed home with shoutings, flags, and salutes of\r\ncannon. In 1819, Sir Francis having continued to fight the good fight\r\nduring the intervening ten years, a great reform meeting was held at\r\nManchester, in the open air. All was orderly till a regiment of cavalry\r\nrode in upon the multitude, and, with drawn swords, cut down men, women,\r\nand children, leaving many dead and wounded on the field. Sir Francis\r\npublished a manly letter to the electors of Westminster, (he being the\r\nrepresentative of that great constituency,) commenting in eloquent terms\r\non this infamous transaction. He was indicted for a seditious libel; and\r\nafter contesting the prosecution, inch by inch, through all the\r\ncourts--not so much for his own sake as for that of the great cause with\r\nwhich he was identified--he was fined L2,000 and imprisoned three\r\nmonths. To read the case, as reported in the English law books, will\r\nmake the cheek of a republican lawyer tingle with indignation. These,\r\nand some other like occurrences in his life, have led candid observers\r\nto regard Sir Francis Burdett as something of a demagogue. He had a\r\nspice of that element in his composition. He was a bold,\r\nstraight-forward man, who told plain truths in a plain way, whether\r\naddressing letters to his constituents, or speeches to the Commons House\r\nof Parliament. He often stood alone among his colleagues, cheered by the\r\nconviction that, though no member voted with him, he was supported by\r\nthe voices of hundreds of thousands of the people. He was a great\r\nreader, a sound thinker, an able debater, and always exerted a\r\ncontrolling influence over the more radical portions of the House. His\r\nfrequent letters to his constituents were dignified and pungent, cost\r\nhim a good deal of persecution and money, and were worth all they cost.\r\nIn 1818, he was chosen, with his friend Romilly, to represent the\r\nimportant borough of Westminster, after one of the bitterest contests\r\nmodern England has known. He retained the seat through many years. In\r\nall the onsets upon corruption and prerogative, down to the era of the\r\nReform bill, he was with the head of the liberal column, and stood where\r\nthe blows fell thickest and heaviest, the idol of the people, the target\r\nof the crown. He was a Wilkes, without so large a measure of cowardice,\r\nmeanness, turbulence, or rottenness of character and principle.\r\n\r\nOne regrets to be compelled to record of such a man, that in his old age\r\nhe grew timid and conservative. After the passage of the Reform bill, he\r\nceased to act with the radicals, and on the occasion of the attempt to\r\ndeprive the Irish Church of a portion of its temporalities, he went\r\nwholly over to the Tories, since which he has sunk into comparative\r\nobscurity. Some years ago, in reply to a speech of Lord John Russell, he\r\nspoke of \"the cant of reform!\" Lord John electrified the House when he\r\nretorted with cutting emphasis, that \"there was such a thing as the\r\n_re_-cant of reform!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n     Parliamentary Reform--Old House of Commons--Rotten Boroughs--Old\r\n     Sarum--French Revolution of 1830--Rally for Reform--Wellington\r\n     Resigns--Grey in Power--Ministerial Bill Defeated--New Parliament\r\n     Summoned--Commons Pass the Bill--Brougham's Speech in Lords--Peers\r\n     Throw out the Bill--Mrs. Partington--Riots--Again Bill Passed by\r\n     Commons, and again Defeated by Peers--Ministers Resign--Are\r\n     Recalled--The Bill becomes a Law.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons was instituted in the thirteenth century, when\r\nHenry III summoned the counties of the realm to send knights, and the\r\nprincipal cities and boroughs to send citizens and burgesses, to\r\nParliament. This was done rather to afford him a check upon his arrogant\r\nbarons, and to procure the sanction of \"_the Commons_,\" (as the untitled\r\nproperty-holders were called,) to certain subsidies, than to vest in\r\nthem any independent functions. But, this \"third estate\" continuing to\r\nbe summoned in subsequent reigns, its influence increased with the\r\nwealth and intelligence of the middle classes, whom it represented, till\r\nwhat was long regarded by them as a burden came to be cherished as a\r\nright and a privilege; and a supple instrument, originally used by the\r\nmonarch to strengthen his prerogative, gradually became the weapon of\r\nthe democracy, to cripple its powers and limit its boundaries.\r\n\r\nAt first, all the counties, and the largest cities and boroughs, were\r\nsummoned. Subsequently, as other towns rose to importance, they were\r\nadded to the list. In process of time, as trade fluctuated, drying up\r\nold channels and opening new, many of the ancient cities and burghs fell\r\ninto decay. Still, they sent representatives to Parliament. In 1509,\r\nthe House consisted of 298 members, many of them even then representing\r\nvery small constituencies. From that period, down to the passage of the\r\nReform bill, no place was disfranchised, (except two or three for\r\nbribery,) while 255 members were added (including Scotland and excluding\r\nIreland,) by the creation of new and the revival of old burghs. During\r\nthe six centuries which the House had existed, what changes had passed\r\nover the kingdom, sweeping away the foundations of once populous marts,\r\nand causing others to rise on barren wastes!\r\n\r\nHere we have the origin of \"_rotten boroughs_;\" i. e., towns which,\r\ncenturies ago, had a flourishing existence, continuing to send\r\nrepresentatives to Parliament long after any human being had made his\r\nlocal habitation therein, and whose very names would have perished from\r\nthe land, but that they were annually recorded on the Parliamentary\r\nrolls. One of these has been immortalized by the discussions on the\r\nReform bill--Old Sarum. Not a soul had dwelt there since the Tudors\r\nascended the English throne--not a tenement had been seen there since\r\nColumbus discovered America--nor could the vestiges of its ruins be\r\ntraced by the antiquarian eye of a Champollion or a Stephens. This\r\nsand-hill, in 1832, sent as many members to Parliament as Lancashire,\r\nwith a population of a million and a half. Other represented boroughs\r\nwere nearly in like condition; others could display their half score or\r\nmore of decayed hovels. In the case of these rotten boroughs, the owner\r\nof the land, or of the old franchises, who was generally a wealthy Peer,\r\nsometimes an aspiring London attorney, occasionally an avaricious\r\nstock-jobbing Jew, by virtue of his single vote designated the\r\nrepresentatives. Subject to the mutations of other real estate and\r\nfranchises, they were transferable by private bargain, or auction, or\r\nsheriff's sale, or will, or assignment of a bankrupt's effects, or as\r\nsecurity for a gambling debt. Not only were they instruments of\r\ncorruption, but ludicrous libels on the claim of the House of Commons\r\nto represent the people, and striking illustrations of extreme\r\ninequality in the distribution of political power.\r\n\r\nAn East India Prince, the Nabob of Arcot, once owned burghs entitled to\r\ntwenty members of Parliament; and through his English agent, who held\r\nthe parchment titles, he sent that number to the Commons. A waiter at a\r\ncelebrated gaming-house sat for years in Parliament in this wise. He\r\nloaned money to a \"noble\" gambler, who gave him security for the loan on\r\na rotten borough, which sent a member. The waiter elected himself to the\r\nseat. In the debates on the Reform bill, it was stated that certain\r\nplaces, with an aggregate population of less than 5,000, returned one\r\nhundred members. Old Sarum, Gatton, Newtown, and other decayed boroughs,\r\nexerted a controlling influence on British legislation, long after some\r\nof them had ceased to be the abodes of humanity; whilst Manchester,\r\nBirmingham, Leeds, and other important towns, swarming with life, and\r\nrich in arts and manufactures, had not a single representative. The\r\nelective franchise was very restricted, and generally based on absurd\r\nqualifications. Scores of members were chosen by close corporations,\r\nwhile others were designated by single individuals. The essence of the\r\nsystem is concentrated in the general fact, that, in 1832, less than two\r\nhundred persons, mostly of the \"privileged orders,\" actually returned a\r\nmajority of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nSo enormous an evil was not without an occasional mite of good. Though\r\nthese coroneted traffickers in Parliamentary seats usually bestowed them\r\non favorites of their own class, there were some notable exceptions to\r\nthis rule. John Horne Tooke, the most radical of all reformers, sat for\r\nOld Sarum, the rottenest of all rotten boroughs. Brougham entered the\r\nCommons through the narrow door of a \"nomination borough,\" though he\r\nleft it with the plaudits of the largest constituency in the kingdom.\r\nBurke, Romilly, Mackintosh, and other illustrious and liberal names,\r\nwere indebted to close corporations for their introduction to Senatorial\r\nfame.\r\n\r\nThis system, the slow growth of centuries, was in full play at the\r\nascension of William IV. It was destined to a speedy overthrow. Early in\r\n1830, a simultaneous movement towards the long-deferred reform was made\r\nthroughout Great Britain and Ireland. George IV died, and William IV\r\nascended the throne, on the 26th of June, 1830. In the following month,\r\nthe people of France rose and drove the Bourbons from their kingdom. The\r\nnews descended upon the already excited mind of England like an\r\nanimating spirit. The mass heaved with the throes of new life. The\r\nreformers held meetings in every important town, to congratulate their\r\nbrethren of France on the expulsion of the elder Bourbons. Drawn\r\ntogether by the bonds of a common sympathy, they realized how numerous\r\nand powerful a body they were. The election for a new Parliament\r\noccurred in September. Liberal candidates sailed with the popular\r\ncurrent. The result showed a great diminution of the supporters of\r\nWellington and Peel. Parliament met in November. The cry of \"Reform!\"\r\nwas ringing from the \"unions\" and \"associations,\" which the last four\r\nmonths had seen established in every considerable town and village in\r\nthe country. The king's speech made no allusion to the subject that\r\nabsorbed all minds. In the exciting debate on the address to the throne,\r\nEarl Grey came out boldly for a radical reform in Parliament.\r\nWellington, in reply, assumed the most hostile ground, declaring that,\r\n\"so long as he held any station in the Government, he should resist to\r\nthe utmost any such measure.\" The announcement that ministers were\r\ndetermined to cling to a system whose rotting props had been for years\r\nfalling away, astonished and inflamed the Opposition. Fifteen days\r\nafterwards, ministers were brought to their senses, by being placed in a\r\nminority in the lower House, on a financial question. The next day, the\r\nIron Duke in the Peers, and the supple Peel in the Commons, announced\r\nthat they had relinquished the helm of affairs!\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington resigned on the 16th of November, 1830. The King\r\nimmediately authorized Lord Grey to form an administration, upon the\r\nbasis of Parliamentary reform--the first liberal ministry, with the\r\nexception of a few turbulent months, for sixty-five years! Lords Grey,\r\nDurham, John Russell, Althorp, Lansdowne, Holland, and Mr. Brougham,\r\nwere its leading spirits; its subordinates being made up of the\r\nMelbournes, the Palmerstons, and other converted Canningites. Parliament\r\nadjourned till February, to afford the new Cabinet time to perfect its\r\nplan. While Downing Street was anxiously cogitating the details of the\r\ngreat measure, its friends stimulated public sentiment in every part of\r\nthe empire. On the 1st of March, 1831, Lord John Russell brought\r\nforward, in the House of Commons, the ministerial plan for a reform in\r\nParliament. A summary of its leading provisions, as finally adopted, is\r\nsubjoined.\r\n\r\nIt was a compromise between representation and prescription, on the\r\nthree principles of disfranchisement, enfranchisement, and extension of\r\nthe suffrage. The number of members, 658, was not altered, but their\r\ndistribution was changed. The ultra rotten borough system was exploded.\r\nIn England, 56 burghs were wholly disfranchised, 31 others partially,\r\nwhilst 41 new towns were enfranchised, part receiving two members,\r\nothers one. The large cities and counties received an increase of\r\nmembers. The same principles were less extensively applied to Scotland\r\nand Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe qualifications of electors were essentially modified, and the\r\naggregate more than doubled. Property, in most cases, still continued to\r\nbe the basis of the right of suffrage. The greatest change was in the\r\ncities and burghs. In those, throughout the United Kingdom, the occupier\r\nof a building of the yearly value of L10, whether he owned or rented it,\r\ncould vote for the local members. The ancient rights of voters, in\r\nburghs not disfranchised, were partially preserved, but provision was\r\nmade for their gradual extinction. It was supposed that the bill added\r\nmore than half a million to the number of Parliamentary electors. In\r\n1838, the number of electors registered was 978,816. It has since\r\nexceeded a million.\r\n\r\nThe sweeping character of the bill surpassed public expectation, and\r\nproduced an electric effect upon the country; the reformers hailing it\r\nwith enthusiasm, whilst the champions of old abuses were stricken with\r\nhorror. Mr. Hume, the leader of the radicals, declared that \"it far\r\nexceeded his highest hopes.\" Sir Charles Wetherell, the oracle of the\r\nlegal formalists, denounced it as \"a corporation robbery.\" Mr. Macaulay,\r\nthe organ of the philosophic reformers, pronounced it \"a great, noble,\r\nand comprehensive plan.\" Sir R. H. Inglis, the representative of the\r\nbigotry of Oxford University, said, \"the plan of ministers meant\r\nrevolution, not reformation.\"\r\n\r\nAll parties girded themselves for such a conflict as England had not\r\nwitnessed for a century. After an inveterate contest of three weeks, the\r\nEnglish bill (one for each kingdom was introduced) passed its second\r\nreading in the House by a majority of only one. A day or two afterwards,\r\nan amendment was carried against ministers, by a majority of eight.\r\nImmediately thereupon ministers announced that they should dissolve\r\nParliament, and appeal to the people. At this suggestion, the Opposition\r\nbroke through all restraint, and denounced them as revolutionists and\r\ntraitors. They dreaded the appeal, for they knew the country was with\r\nthe ministry. The Tory Peers resolved on the desperate measure of\r\npreventing the dissolution, by arresting the reading of the king's\r\nspeech. The day came, and brought with it a scene of uproar in both\r\nHouses, which baffles description. A cotemporary writer says:\r\n\r\n     \"A hope had remained, that the project of stopping the king's\r\n     speech, and interposing an address, might succeed. That hope rested\r\n     entirely upon the speech being read by the Chancellor, (Brougham,)\r\n     and not by the king in person. Suddenly the thunder of the guns was\r\n     heard to roar, breaking the silence of the anxious crowds without,\r\n     and drowning even the noise that filled the walls of Parliament. In\r\n     the fullness of his royal state, and attended by all his\r\n     magnificent Court, the monarch approached the House of Lords.\r\n     Preceded by the great officers of state and of the household, he\r\n     moved through the vast halls, which were filled with troops in iron\r\n     mail, as the outside courts were with horse, while the guns boomed,\r\n     and martial music filled the air. Having stopped in the robing\r\n     chamber in order to put on his crown, he entered the House and\r\n     ascended the throne, while his officers and ministers crowded\r\n     around him. As soon as he was seated, he ordered the usher of the\r\n     black rod to summon the Commons; and his Majesty, after passing\r\n     some bills, addressed them. By those who were present, the effect\r\n     will not soon be forgotten, of the first words he pronounced, or\r\n     the firmness with which they were uttered, when he said that 'he\r\n     had come to meet his Parliament in order to prorogue it, with a\r\n     view to its immediate dissolution, for the purpose of ascertaining\r\n     the sense of his people in regard to such changes in the\r\n     representation as circumstances might appear to require.' He then,\r\n     with an audible voice, commanded the Lord Chancellor to prorogue;\r\n     which being done, the Houses dispersed, and the royal procession\r\n     returned amidst the hearty and enthusiastic shouts of thousands of\r\n     the people.\"\r\n\r\nGreat praise is due to the \"Sailor King\" for the firmness with which he\r\nstood by his reform ministers in this crisis, despite the clamors of\r\nalarmists in Church and State.\r\n\r\nAt the elections, the friends of the bill swept the country. They\r\ncarried nearly all the counties, and all the cities and large towns. Its\r\nopponents obtained their recruits chiefly from close corporations and\r\nrotten boroughs. The English bill was proposed in the New House on the\r\n24th of June, and, after a running fight of three months, passed the\r\nCommons by 109 majority, and was sent to the Lords. The greatest anxiety\r\nwas felt for its fate in that refuge of ancient conservatism. The debate\r\non the second reading continued four nights. On the last evening,\r\nOctober 7th, Lord Brougham spoke five hours in its support, making the\r\ngreat effort of his remarkable life. His speech was an era in the\r\nhistory of that House.\r\n\r\nHe replied _seriatim_ to the opponents of the measure, dissecting this\r\nlord with keen logic, scathing that marquis with impassioned rebuke,\r\nholding this duke's ignorance up to ridicule, putting down the\r\neffrontery of that viscount, basting this earl with the oil of flattery\r\nwhile he roasted him with intense reasoning, and bringing to the defense\r\nand elucidation of the bill those rich stores of learning, argument,\r\neloquence, wit, sarcasm, denunciation, and appeal, which have given him\r\nan undying name. The radical boldness of his doctrines, and the\r\n_abandon_ with which he demolished \"illustrious dukes,\" or tore the\r\ndrapery from \"noble lords,\" were no less remarkable features of this\r\nspeech, than its transcendent ability. Lord Dudley, probably the first\r\nscholar and the most polished orator in the House, had sneered at \"the\r\nstatesmen of Birmingham, and the philosophers of Manchester.\" Brougham\r\nrepelled the sneer, and, in a passage of keen severity, contrasted Lord\r\nDudley's accomplishments with the practical sense of the men he had\r\ntraduced, closing it by saying, \"To affirm that I could ever dream of\r\nputting the noble earl's opinions, aye, or his knowledge, in any\r\ncomparison with the bold, rational, judicious, reflecting, natural, and,\r\nbecause natural, the trustworthy opinions of those honest men, who\r\nalways give their strong sense fair play, having no affectations to warp\r\ntheir judgment--to dream of any such comparison as this, would be, on my\r\npart, a flattery far too gross for any courtesy, or a blindness which no\r\nhabits of friendship could excuse.\"\r\n\r\nHe brought his great speech to a close, by uttering this solemn warning:\r\n\r\n     \"My lords, I do not disguise the intense solicitude I feel for the\r\n     event of this debate, because I know full well that the peace of\r\n     the country is involved in the issue. I cannot look without dismay\r\n     at the rejection of this measure. But, grievous as may be the\r\n     consequences of a temporary defeat--temporary it can only be--for\r\n     its ultimate, and even speedy success, is certain. Nothing can now\r\n     stop it. Do not suffer yourselves to be persuaded that, even if the\r\n     present ministers were driven from the helm, any one could steer\r\n     you through the troubles which surround you, without reform. But\r\n     our successors would take up the task in circumstances far less\r\n     auspicious. Under them, you would be fain to grant a bill, compared\r\n     with which, the one we now proffer you is moderate indeed. Hear the\r\n     parable of the Sybil; for it conveys a wise and wholesome moral.\r\n     She now appears at your gate, and offers you mildly the volumes,\r\n     the precious volumes of wisdom and peace. The price she asks is\r\n     reasonable; to restore the franchise which, without any bargain,\r\n     you ought voluntarily to give. You refuse her terms, her moderate\r\n     terms. She darkens the porch no longer. But soon, for you cannot do\r\n     without her wares, you call her back. Again she comes, but with\r\n     diminished treasures. The leaves of the book are in part torn away\r\n     by lawless hands; in part defaced with characters of blood. But the\r\n     prophetic maid has risen in her demands--it is Parliaments by the\r\n     Year--it is Vote by the Ballot--it is Suffrage by the Million! From\r\n     this, you turn away indignant, and for a second time she departs.\r\n     Beware of her third coming; for the treasure you must have; and\r\n     what price she may next demand, who shall tell? It may be even the\r\n     mace which rests upon that woolsack. What may follow your course of\r\n     obstinacy, if persisted in, I cannot take upon me to predict, nor\r\n     do I wish to conjecture. But this I well know--that, as sure as man\r\n     is mortal, and to err is human, justice deferred enhances the price\r\n     at which you must purchase safety and peace; nor can you expect to\r\n     gather in another crop than they did who went before you, if you\r\n     persevere in their utterly abominable husbandry, of sowing\r\n     injustice and reaping rebellion.... You are the highest judicature\r\n     in the realm. It is a judge's first duty never to pronounce\r\n     sentence, in the most trifling case, without hearing. Will you make\r\n     this the exception? Are you really prepared to determine, but not\r\n     to hear, the mighty cause upon which a nation's hopes and fears\r\n     hang? You are! Then beware of your decision! Rouse not a\r\n     peace-loving but resolute people. Alienate not from your body the\r\n     affections of a whole empire. I counsel you to assist with your\r\n     uttermost efforts in preserving the peace, and upholding and\r\n     perpetuating the Constitution. Therefore I pray and exhort you not\r\n     to reject this measure. By all you hold dear--by all the ties that\r\n     bind every one of us to our common order and our common country, I\r\n     solemnly adjure you, I warn you, I implore you, yea, on my bended\r\n     knees, I supplicate you, reject not this bill!\"\r\n\r\nThe warning and the appeal were in vain. The bill was thrown out on the\r\nsecond reading by 41 majority. The struggle for the mastery between the\r\npeople and the nobility had now come. The Commons adopted a strong vote\r\nof confidence in ministers, and ministers resolved to stand by the bill.\r\nParliament was prorogued till December. In the vacation, reform meetings\r\nassembled in unprecedented numbers. On one of these occasions, at\r\nTaunton, Sydney Smith first brought to notice a venerable matron whose\r\nname is likely to be immortal in both hemispheres. In the course of his\r\nspeech, the witty divine said:\r\n\r\n     \"I do not mean to be disrespectful, but the attempt of the Lords to\r\n     stop the progress of reform reminds me very forcibly of the great\r\n     storm of Sidmouth, and of the conduct of the excellent Mrs.\r\n     Partington on the occasion. In the winter of 1824, there set in a\r\n     great flood upon that town--the tide rose to an incredible\r\n     hight--the waves rushed in upon the houses, and everything was\r\n     threatened with destruction. In the midst of this sublime and\r\n     terrible storm, Dame Partington, who lived upon the beach, was seen\r\n     at the door of her house with mop and pattens, trundling her mop\r\n     and squeezing out the sea-water, and vigorously pushing away the\r\n     Atlantic Ocean. The Atlantic was roused. Mrs. Partington's spirit\r\n     was up; but I need not tell you that the contest was unequal. The\r\n     Atlantic Ocean beat Mrs. Partington. She was excellent at a slop,\r\n     or a puddle, but she should not have meddled with a tempest.\r\n     Gentlemen, be at your ease--be quiet and steady. You will beat Mrs.\r\n     Partington.\"\r\n\r\nA few riots gave diversity to the scene. At Derby, the mob demolished\r\nthe property of some anti-reformers--they terribly frightened Sir\r\nCharles Wetherell, at Bristol--they burnt the Duke of Newcastle's\r\nturreted seat, at Nottingham--they smashed the windows of Apsley House,\r\nthe town residence of the Duke of Wellington. The country was profoundly\r\nagitated, and the firmness of ministers averted a revolution.\r\n\r\nParliament met in December. The king's speech urged reform. Lord John\r\nintroduced the English bill, slightly improved. A factious opposition,\r\nand an adjournment for the holidays, kept it suspended till the 22d of\r\nMarch, 1832, when it passed the Commons, and was sent to the Lords.\r\nAfter a hot debate, it passed the second reading, when a hostile\r\namendment, which destroyed its utility, was sprung upon the House and\r\nadopted, on the 7th of May. The next day, Lord Grey asked, according to\r\na previous understanding, for the creation of a sufficient number of\r\nPeers to carry the bill. The King declined. Ministers instantly\r\nresigned. The Commons addressed the King in behalf of ministers, with\r\nrare boldness. The people assembled _en masse_, and petitioned the\r\nCommons to stop the supplies. Many meetings resolved to pay no more\r\ntaxes till the bill became a law. The King requested Wellington to form\r\na compromise administration. At this proposal, the popular indignation\r\nwas kindled afresh. Things were approaching a fearful crisis. The Duke\r\ntried to execute the royal wish--the ultras of both parties were not\r\ninvited to seats in the Cabinet--the half-and-half reformers would not\r\ncome through fear--and he gave up the task in despair. The King recalled\r\nGrey, with a pledge to create new Peers, if necessary. This brought the\r\nrefractory Lords to terms. Dreading the introduction of so large a body\r\nof liberals into their ancient hall, whose votes would avail the\r\nreformers in future contests, a sufficient number of Tories absented\r\nthemselves from the Peers to insure the passage of the bill. Those who\r\nremained concentrated, in their dying denunciations, the venom of the\r\nentire opposition. The English bill received the royal assent on the 7th\r\nof June, 1832. The Scotch and Irish bills speedily followed, and the\r\nmonth of July, after a two years' contest, which had shaken the empire\r\nto its center, saw the new Constitution of the House of Commons\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nThough the Reform bill has not proved to be so large a concession to the\r\npopular demands as was intended, nor as beneficial to the country as was\r\nanticipated, it was the greatest tribute to the democratic principle\r\nwhich the nation had paid since the Commonwealth. Its defects will be\r\ndiscussed when we examine the Chartist movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nHenry Lord Brougham--His Life, Services, and Character.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn connection with the passage of the Reform bill, it is proper to\r\nnotice one of the foremost Englishmen of this century--HENRY BROUGHAM.\r\nNothing strikes one more forcibly in the life of this extraordinary\r\nperson than the number and variety of the subjects upon which he has\r\nexerted his powers. His published speeches and writings on either one of\r\nseveral of the political measures he has advocated, if viewed merely as\r\nintellectual efforts, might satisfy the ambition of an honorable\r\naspirant after forensic or literary fame. The aggregate constitutes\r\nhardly a tithe of his achievements in the cognate departments of public\r\naffairs. From his entrance into the House of Commons down to the present\r\ntime, his name glows on every page of England's parliamentary history;\r\nand his posterity will permit but few of the myriad rays that encircle\r\nit to be effaced or obscured. As an advocate and a jurist, many of his\r\nspeeches at the bar and opinions on the bench will live long after the\r\nlaw of libel and the court of chancery cease to oppress and vex mankind.\r\nHis services in the cause of popular education, whether we regard the\r\ntime expended, the ability displayed, or the results attained, surpass\r\nthe labors of many persons who have been assigned to a foremost place\r\namong the eminent benefactors of their age. His contributions to the\r\nEdinburgh Review, covering its whole existence, and a large circle of\r\nliterary, scientific, political, social, legal, and historical subjects,\r\nwould class him with the highest rank of periodical essayists. His more\r\nsubstantial works, as Sketches of Eminent Statesmen, History of the\r\nFrench Revolution, Lives of Men of Letters and Science, Discourse on\r\nNatural Theology, Political Philosophy, composed amidst the cares of\r\npublic official station, would suffice to give him an enduring name in\r\nthe republic of letters.\r\n\r\nGreat as are his mental achievements, it is as the early advocate of\r\nsocial progress and political reform--the champion of liberty and peace,\r\nthe friend of man--that he is worthy of all his cotemporaneous fame, and\r\nall the applause which coming generations will bestow on his memory.\r\nInconsistency, the common infirmity of mortals, has checkered his\r\ncourse--eccentricity, \"the twin brother of genius,\" has been his\r\nfrequent companion--independence, whose adjacent province is obstinacy,\r\nhe has largely exhibited; but, while the history of England, during the\r\nfirst third of the nineteenth century, remains, it will display to the\r\nimpartial eye few names to excite more grateful admiration in every\r\nlover of his race than that which, from the abolition of the slave trade\r\nin 1806, to the abolition of slavery in 1834, was synonymous with\r\nintelligent progress and useful reform.\r\n\r\nI believe Brougham was born about the year 1779. We first hear of him,\r\nwhen twenty years old, in Edinburgh, communicating some papers on\r\ngeometry to the Royal Society in London, which were highly applauded,\r\nand translated into foreign tongues. In 1808, he appeared as counsel at\r\nthe bar of Parliament, in behalf of the commercial and manufacturing\r\ninterests, against the celebrated _Orders in Council_, which followed\r\nthe Berlin Decree of Napoleon, and preceded the American Embargo. His\r\nexamination of witnesses, extending through several weeks, and his\r\nclosing argument, gave him a high reputation in England, and a name both\r\nin Europe and the United States. In 1809-10, he entered the theater\r\nwhere, for forty years, he has displayed his extraordinary gifts. His\r\nfirst published speech in Parliament, delivered in 1810, was a powerful\r\nappeal in favor of addressing the Throne for more effectual measures to\r\nsuppress the slave trade. His next great effort was in 1812, when,\r\nassisted by Mr. Baring, (Lord Ashburton,) he examined witnesses for\r\nseveral weeks before the House of Commons, to prove that the still\r\nunrescinded Orders were ruining the trade and manufactures of the\r\ncountry, and provoking a war with the United States. At the close, he\r\nsupported an address to the Throne for their repeal, in a speech replete\r\nwith information, ably defending the policy of unrestricted commerce,\r\nand eloquently vindicating the superiority of the arts of peace over the\r\nglories of war. The motion prevailed--but too late to avert hostilities.\r\nCongress declared war the very day the speech was delivered.\r\n\r\nHis services in the cause of the people from this time downward, have\r\nbeen referred to in these chapters, as various subjects have passed\r\nunder consideration. During the long and almost hopeless struggle of\r\nLiberty with Power, from 1810 to 1830, when he was removed from the\r\ntheater of his greatest fame, he led the forlorn hope in the House of\r\nCommons. Unlike his great prototype, Fox, he never for a moment retired\r\nfrom the field in disgust and despair, but was ever at his post,\r\nstimulating the drooping spirits of his friends, hurling defiance at his\r\nfoes, and rising from every defeat with renewed courage and strength.\r\nThough classified among the heads of the Opposition in the House, he\r\nnever was--he never would be, in the strict sense, a party \"leader.\"\r\nNor, on the contrary, did he surround himself with a \"clique\" or\r\n\"interest,\" whose oracle he was. Supporting the measures of the Whigs,\r\nhe was ever in advance of them, cheering on the masses, as the Tribune\r\nof the people, and fighting the partisan battles of Reform as the\r\nguerrilla chief of Liberty.\r\n\r\nIn an evil hour, he was transplanted from his \"native heath\" to the\r\nconservatory of the aristocracy. Though surrounded by uncongenial\r\nspirits, and haunted with the nightmare of conservatism, the soul of\r\nMcGregor retained for years much of its original fire in a place whose\r\nchilling atmosphere made the lion blood of a Chatham to stagnate and\r\ncurdle. Some of his mightiest efforts in the good cause were put forth\r\nafter he _descended_ to the upper House of Parliament.\r\n\r\nHad Brougham coveted and obtained \"leadership\" in its party sense, in\r\neither House, he must have failed. Too original, independent, wayward,\r\nand dogmatical, to be implicitly trusted and obeyed by his equals; too\r\nincautious and pushing; too impatient of dullness; too much of a genius,\r\nto be always appreciated and confided in by his inferiors, though he\r\nwould have been applauded by the masses; yet his premiership, had he\r\naccepted the offer of King William, could not have long survived the\r\npassage of the Reform bill. With the exception of taking the great seal,\r\nhe has chosen to be what he is--a rare comet, created to move in no\r\norbit but its own--beautiful and lustrous in the distance, but grand and\r\nterrible in proximity.\r\n\r\nThe public measures with which he is most closely identified are--the\r\nadvocacy of the manufacturing and commercial interests, as opposed to\r\nOrders in Council and other restrictions on trade; hostility to the\r\ncontinental combinations of the successors of Pitt, and their legitimate\r\noffspring, exhausting wars and the Holy Alliance; the vindication of\r\nQueen Caroline, in the struggle with her libertine husband; the freedom\r\nof the press, attempted to be overawed by prosecutions for libels on the\r\nGovernment and the church; the education of the middle and lower orders;\r\nreligious toleration for dissenters and Catholics; reform in the civil\r\nand criminal law; parliamentary reform; municipal reform; poor laws\r\nreform; the abolition of the slave trade and slavery; retrenchment in\r\nGovernment expenditures; the independence of the Canadian Legislature,\r\nand the repeal of the corn laws. What a catalogue have we here! Upon all\r\nthese measures, each of which was an era in British history, Brougham\r\nhas acted a leading, and upon many, a controlling part. His speeches\r\nupon most of them surpassed those of any other of their advocates,\r\nwhether we consider the extent of the information displayed, the depth\r\nand energy of the reasoning, the scope and vigor of the style, the\r\neloquence of the appeals to justice and humanity, or the majesty and\r\nsplendor of the higher passages.\r\n\r\nLord Brougham's fame, as an orator, has filled two hemispheres. We will\r\nlook at him in the two aspects of matter and manner.\r\n\r\nThe four volumes of his speeches, with others gleaned from the\r\nParliamentary reports, prove that his reputation is well founded. Their\r\nleading characteristic is power--crushing power--as distinguished from\r\nbeauty and grace. They are not so gorgeous as Burke's, nor so compact as\r\nWebster's. But they contain more information and argument, and less\r\nphilosophy and fancy, than the former's--more versatility and vigor, and\r\nless staid grandeur and studied method, than the latter's. As\r\n_speeches_, rather than _orations_, addressed to a deliberative body of\r\nfriends and foes, who are to _act_ upon the subject under discussion,\r\nthey are more practical and to the matter in hand than Burke's; more\r\nhearty and soul-stirring than Webster's. Their style is a mixture of\r\nBurke and Webster--less extravagant anywhere than some passages of the\r\nformer; frequently more slovenly than any passage of the latter; with\r\nmore of bitter personal taunt and lofty rebuke of fraud, meanness, and\r\noppression, than either. Viewed as literary productions, regardless of\r\nthe immediate fruits they produced, they will hardly stand the test of\r\nposthumous fame like Burke's. Less universal in their application, less\r\npenetrated with principles adapted alike to all times, they often betray\r\nthe advocate instead of the statesman, the partisan rather than the\r\nphilosopher, the leader and champion of cotemporaries rather than the\r\ninstructor and mentor of posterity. But it still remains a question,\r\nwhether they were not the more valuable on that very account. Their\r\nimmediate effect in moving masses of men, and molding public measures,\r\nfar surpassed that of Burke's. And though the _words_ of the latter may\r\noutlive those of the former, we have the highest authority for saying,\r\nblessed are those whose _works_ survive them.\r\n\r\nLord Brougham's speeches deal little in mere declamation, even of the\r\nhighest order, but are pregnant with apposite facts and arguments,\r\ngiving the reader or hearer an unusual amount of information upon the\r\nmatters under discussion. He excels, when he tries, in a plain, lucid\r\nstatement of his subject; as witness, his speech on law reform, in 1828,\r\nwhen, for seven hours, he held the close attention of the unprofessional\r\nHouse of Commons, while he sketched the absurdities and abuses of every\r\nbranch of the common law, and detailed the amendments he proposed in its\r\nprinciples and administration. But this is not his _forte_, and for that\r\nvery reason his dexterity and self-control excite our admiration the\r\nmore. If you would see him in his greatest moods, you must give him a\r\nperson or a party to attack, which shall arouse his combative\r\npropensities, and bring his invective and sarcasm into full play; or\r\nsome giant abuse to anathematize and demolish, which shall inflame his\r\nindignation and abhorrence.\r\n\r\nWe gather from his own statements that the garb and colors in which he\r\nattires the main body of a speech--the mere style and diction--are the\r\nimpulse of the occasion; as most of the sarcasms and rebukes are flung\r\nout in the heat of delivery. But, where time for preparation is\r\nafforded, no speaker is more careful in arranging the general drift of\r\nthe argument, and digesting the facts to illustrate and sustain it;\r\nwhilst certain passages, such as the exordium or peroration, are the\r\nresult of the most pains-taking labors of the closet. He has recorded\r\nthat the peroration of his speech in the Queen's case was written no\r\nless than ten times before he thought it fit for so august an occasion.\r\nThe same is probably true of similar passages in Webster's speeches; it\r\nis known to be so of Burke's.\r\n\r\nNo orator of our times is more successful in embalming phrases, full of\r\nmeaning, in the popular memory. The well-known talismanic sentiment,\r\n\"_The schoolmaster is abroad_,\" is an instance. In a speech on the\r\nelevation of Wellington, a mere \"military chieftain,\" to the\r\npremiership, after the death of Canning, Brougham said: \"Field Marshal\r\nthe Duke of Wellington may take the army--he may take the navy--he may\r\ntake the great seal--he may take the miter. I make him a present of them\r\nall. Let him come on with his whole force, sword in hand, against the\r\nConstitution, and the English people will not only beat him back, but\r\nlaugh at his assaults. In other times, the country may have heard with\r\ndismay that 'the soldier was abroad.' It will not be so now. Let the\r\nsoldier be abroad if he will; he can do nothing in this age. There is\r\nanother personage abroad--a personage less imposing--in the eyes of\r\nsome, perhaps, insignificant. The schoolmaster is abroad; and I trust to\r\nhim, armed with his primer, against the soldier in full military array.\"\r\n\r\nTurning from the matter to the manner of the orator, (if we have not\r\nalready passed the boundary,) Brougham stood unrivaled as a debater in\r\nthe House of Commons. For twenty years he swayed the intellect and\r\npassions of the House, by his muscular and courageous eloquence, whilst\r\nCastlereagh, Canning, and Peel controlled its majorities and dictated\r\nits measures, by the wave of their official wand. Castlereagh was more\r\nself-possessed and matter-of-fact than he; Canning more brilliant and\r\nclassical; Peel more dexterous and plausible. But, in weight of metal,\r\nhe surpassed them all. His oratory was not the brawl and foam of a\r\ndashing mountain torrent, but the steady roar of the deep, broad\r\ncataract. In ability to inflame friends and foes, and shake the House\r\ntill it quaked, he equaled either Chatham or Fox. When thoroughly\r\nroused, with all his elements in full play, he thundered and lightened\r\ntill the knights of the shire clung to the Benches for support, the\r\nMinisters cowered behind the Speaker's chair for shelter, and the voting\r\nmembers started from their slumbers in the side galleries, as if the\r\nlast trump were ringing in their ears.\r\n\r\nChatham introduced the style of the House of Commons into the debates of\r\nthe House of Lords. Brougham's appearance there constituted almost as\r\nnew an era in its oratory as the advent of Chatham. It was my good\r\nfortune to hear him two or three times in the Lords, several years\r\nago--once when his best powers were put in action for a brief hour.\r\n\r\nWe enter the House of Peers. The lions--Brougham, Grey, Wellington,\r\nLyndhurst, Melbourne--are in their places. An exciting debate is going\r\nforward, which has taken rather a personal turn. Yonder is Brougham,\r\nstretched out half his length on one of the Ministerial benches; now\r\nlistening to a clumsy Earl on the floor, whom he eyes with a portentous\r\nscowl; anon whispering a hurried word to the Peer at his elbow. What an\r\nungainly figure! Those long legs and arms, loosely hung in their\r\nsockets, give him a slouching air. Human face could hardly look more\r\nugly or intellectual. His iron-gray hair bristles over his forehead like\r\nthe quills of the fretful porcupine. His restless eye peers through\r\neyebrows that seem alive with nerves. He must be agitated with the\r\ndebate, for he writhes as though his red cushion were a sheet of hot\r\niron. He suddenly starts up, (who ever knew him to sit still five\r\nminutes?) walks with long strides toward the door, and while chatting\r\nwith the ladies, his tormentor stops, and the ex-Chancellor cries, with\r\nstartling emphasis, (lest some one get the floor before him,) \"My\r\nLords!\" and slowly advances to the table in front of the woolsack. An\r\naudible _hush_ runs round the chamber; for they had been anticipating a\r\nreply from the mercurial lord. Every whisper ceases, and all eyes are\r\nfixed on the towering intellect before them. The Peeresses leave their\r\ndamask chairs, and approach the bar, to get a better view of the orator.\r\nMembers of the House of Commons, till now chatting round the bar, lean\r\nforward in silence. The loungers in the lobbies enter the Hall, the word\r\nhaving passed out, \"Brougham is up!\" The untitled spectators rise from\r\ntheir seats on the carpet, where fatigue had sunk them, and stand on\r\ntiptoe, to catch every glance of the eye and wave of the hand of the\r\nscholar and statesman, whilst the crowded galleries forget their\r\nlassitude in listening to one whose name and fame are the property of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nBut to the speech. Listen to that first sentence! How it plunges into\r\nthe very center of the subject. Every word is an argument--every period\r\na demonstration. The first blow knocks the keystone from his last\r\nantagonist's speech, and tumbles the whole structure on his affrighted\r\nhead and shoulders. And the dandy young Lord, over in the corner, who,\r\nin the puny oration he recited so prettily an hour ago, went out of his\r\nway to sneer at Brougham--see the blood fly from his cheeks when his\r\nnice little piece of rhetoric comes rattling in bits round his ears. As\r\nthe lion fixes his eye on him, he would give his coronet and his curls\r\nif he could slink into a nutshell. A fiery glance or two having withered\r\nhim, the monarch of the debate grapples with worthier antagonists. What\r\na sweep does he give to the argument--what redundancy of facts--what\r\nfertility of illustration. How large the field of his comprehension--how\r\nexhaustless and varied its resources. What execution is done by those\r\nlong-drawn sentences, with parenthesis within parenthesis, each a\r\nlogical syllogism, or a home-thrust fact, or a blighting sarcasm, wound\r\nround and round his victims, till they are crushed in their folds! Great\r\nin matter, his speech is equally powerful in manner; violating every law\r\nof rhetoric and oratory promulgated by the schools, he is a law unto\r\nhimself--original, commanding, majestic.\r\n\r\nBrougham, having demolished his antagonists, took a seat at the clerk's\r\ntable, and began to write a letter, when the Chancellor (Cottenham) rose\r\nand commenced a conciliatory speech. His calm, slow, cool manner\r\ncontrasted strongly with the tempest which had just passed over our\r\nheads, reminding us of those dewy showers which follow smilingly in the\r\ntrail of a dark cloud, after its thunder and lightning and torrent have\r\nraged and blazed and poured, and passed away.\r\n\r\nThis great man has been described so often, that not only his public\r\nhistory and mental character, but his personal peculiarities--yea, the\r\nnervous twitching of his eyebrows--are as familiar to Americans as to\r\nthe reporters in the gallery of the House of Lords. As an orator or\r\ndebater, he is sometimes compared to Webster. The very attempt is unjust\r\nto both. You might as well compare the repose of Lake Erie to the\r\nthunder of Niagara. Each has his own sphere of greatness. The Bostonian\r\nrarely enters the arena of debate, unless clad in mail to his fingers'\r\nends--a safe and strong debater. Not so the Londoner. He sometimes\r\nrushes, sword in hand, without scabbard or shield, into the thickest of\r\nthe fight, and gets sorely galled. Little arrows do not pierce Webster,\r\nnor do ordinary occasions summon forth his heaviest weapons. But\r\nBrougham, why, he will fight with anybody, and on any terms. The\r\nsmallest Lilliput in the House can sting him into paroxysms with his\r\nneedle-spear. But wo to the assailant! The bolt which annihilates the\r\nEarl of Musketo is equally heavy with that which strikes down the Duke\r\nof Wellington. As a whole, Brougham is unlike any of our public men.\r\nCould we mix into one compound the several qualities of Webster, Clay,\r\nChoate, Benton, and the late John Quincy Adams, and divide the mass into\r\nfour or five parts, we might, by adding a strong tincture of John C.\r\nCalhoun, make four or five very good Henry Broughams.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the versatility of Brougham's talents and acquirements.\r\nSir E. B. Sugden was arguing a cause before him in chancery. The\r\nChancellor was not very attentive to the argument, employing part of the\r\ntime in writing letters. This greatly piqued Sugden; and on retiring\r\nfrom the court, he drily said to a friend, \"If Brougham only knew a\r\nlittle of Chancery law, he would know a little of everything.\"\r\nUndoubtedly he knows something about everything, and much about most\r\nthings. Somebody has compared him to a Scotch Encyclopedia, without\r\nalphabetical arrangement. If he has not reached the highest place in any\r\ndepartment of knowledge, it is because, in traversing so vast a field,\r\nhe must here and there be necessarily only a gleaner. His success in so\r\nmany departments proves that had he cultivated but one or two, he might\r\nhave surpassed all cotemporary competition. Looking to the variety and\r\nextent of his acquisitions and labors, posterity will regard him as one\r\nof the most extraordinary men of his time. He reached his eminent\r\nposition by no royal road. He is among the most laborious and diligent\r\nof men. Well known facts attest his wonderful activity.\r\n\r\nHis able work, \"Practical Observations upon the Education of the\r\nPeople,\" published in 1825, was composed, he says, during hours stolen\r\nfrom sleep. Combe states of him, that he was once engaged in a court of\r\nlaw all day, from which he went to the House of Commons, and mingled in\r\nthe debate till two o'clock in the morning; he then retired to his\r\nhouse, and wrote upon an article for the Edinburgh Review till it was\r\ntime to go to the court, where he was actively employed till the hour\r\nfor the assembling of the Commons; thither he went, and participated in\r\nthe discussion as vigorously as usual till long after midnight--taking\r\nno rest till the morning of the third day! The witty Hazlitt, alluding,\r\nat the time, to his speeches on commercial and manufacturing distress,\r\nsaid, \"He is apprised of the exact state of our exports and imports, and\r\nscarce a ship clears out its cargo from Liverpool or Hull, but he has a\r\ncopy of the bill of lading.\" It will be remembered, that while\r\nperforming his political and miscellaneous labors, he was surrounded by\r\na large circle of professional clients. His inaugural discourse, as Lord\r\nRector of the University of Glasgow, thickly strown with Greek and Latin\r\nquotations, was, as the preface informs us, written during the business\r\nof the Northern Circuit. Sydney Smith says, in one of his graphic Reform\r\nspeeches, \"See the gigantic Brougham, sworn in at twelve o'clock, [as\r\nChancellor,] and before six, has a bill on the table abolishing the\r\nabuses of a Court which has been the curse of the people of England for\r\ncenturies.\"\r\n\r\nA full share of the preparation and defense of the measures of Earl\r\nGrey's Administration devolved on him; while at the same time he did the\r\nwork of an ordinary man in writing rudimental articles for the Penny\r\nMagazine, and scientific tracts for the Society for the Diffusion of\r\nUseful Knowledge, lecturing to Mechanics' Institutes, and contributing\r\nessays to the Edinburgh Review. An English friend informed me that\r\nduring one of the busiest periods of his official life, a fatal accident\r\nhappened to some laborers in excavating a deep well. Forthwith, out came\r\na tract from the Lord Chancellor, on the best and safest mode of digging\r\nwells! Though his numerous publications and addresses on learned\r\nsubjects, and his participation in the proceedings of the Royal Society\r\nand French Institute showed their author to be a scientific man, his\r\nlater Lives of Men of Letters and Science exhibited an acquaintance with\r\nthe sciences in his old age, for which his friends were hardly prepared.\r\nIn the particulars here mentioned, no public man of our country can be\r\ncompared with him, except the late John Quincy Adams, for whose\r\nwonderful exploits in his declining years Lord Brougham expressed the\r\nhighest admiration.\r\n\r\nThe great political error of his life was his acceptance of the\r\nChancellorship, and consequent removal from the House of Commons. It may\r\nbe remarked, in passing, that it is a mistake to suppose he diminished\r\nhis reputation as a lawyer by his judicial administration. He was never\r\na first-rate technical lawyer. His mind was too broad, his ambition too\r\nhigh, to be a _mere_ lawyer, tied down with red tape to _nisi prius_\r\nprecedents and the _dicta_ of cases. The profession to him was not an\r\nend, as it was to Scarlett and his school, but a subsidiary means to\r\nattain political eminence and influence. A great cause, like that of\r\nQueen Caroline, or of Williams, indicted for a libel on the Durham\r\nclergy, showed what he could accomplish when he bent his powers to\r\nprofessional work. His speeches on Law Reform prove his minute\r\nacquaintance with and utter contempt for the great body of the common\r\nlaw, as administered by the courts; and when presiding in a tribunal\r\nwhose currents had been brought to a dead stand by the \"everlasting\r\ndoubts\" of Lord Eldon, the best service he could render suitors and the\r\ncountry was to clear out the channels, and set the streams flowing, even\r\nthough he might make mistakes in acting on the expedient maxim, that \"it\r\nis better to have a case decided wrong, than not at all.\"\r\n\r\nNo man laments his removal to the upper House more keenly than himself.\r\nSpeaking of Chatham's removal, he says, \"No one ever did it voluntarily\r\nwithout bitterly rueing the step, when he found the price paid to be the\r\nloss of all real power.\" Grey first offered him the gown of Attorney\r\nGeneral. Feeling it to be beneath his position in the Reform party, he\r\ncontemptuously rejected it. The great seal was then placed in his hand.\r\nHe should rather have taken the pen of one of the Secretaries of State,\r\nand remained on his \"native heath.\" There he would have been at home,\r\nand there he would have been now. By superiority of intellect, or his\r\n\"managing\" or \"pushing\" propensity, the chief defense of the ministry in\r\nthe Peers devolved on him instead of the Premier. He was in a false\r\nposition. His native element was opposition. He was unequaled at tearing\r\ndown--he had no skill for building up. The Reformers expected much from\r\nthe new Administration, and everything from Brougham. All went smoothly\r\ntill the Reform bill passed. Large quantities of ripe fruit were\r\nexpected thereupon to be immediately gathered. Sydney Smith foreshadowed\r\nthis, in his droll way. Said he, in a speech during the struggle, \"All\r\nyoung ladies will imagine, as soon as this bill is carried, that they\r\nwill be instantly married. Schoolboys believe that gerunds and supines\r\nwill be abolished, and that currant tarts must ultimately come down in\r\nprice; the corporal and sergeant are sure of double pay; bad poets will\r\nexpect a demand for their epics; fools will be disappointed, as they\r\nalways are; reasonable men, who know what to expect, will find that a\r\nvery serious good has been obtained.\"\r\n\r\nMuch was done for Reform by the Grey ministry, after the passage of the\r\nbill. In less than two years, West India slavery was abolished--the East\r\nIndia Company's monopoly destroyed--the poor laws amended--the criminal\r\ncode softened--the administration of the Courts essentially\r\nimproved--the Scotch municipal corporations totally reformed--and many\r\nabuses corrected in the Irish Church Establishment. But young ladies,\r\nbad poets, and fools of all sorts, clamored for more; and many\r\nreasonable men were disappointed. The dead weights on advance movements\r\nwere the Melbournes, the Palmerstons, the Grants, who, having bitterly\r\nopposed Reform all their days, were converted at the eleventh hour of\r\nthe recent struggle, and brought into the Cabinet. The fatal measure of\r\nthe Administration was an attempt to suppress agitation in Ireland, by a\r\nCoercion bill, which excited a quarrel with O'Connell, and divisions in\r\nthe Cabinet, and finally led to the resignation of Grey. Glad to escape\r\nfrom an uneasy position, Brougham soon followed. Would that he could\r\nhave got rid of his title, like Mirabeau, by opening a shop, and gone\r\nback to the Commons! But it stuck to him like the tunic of Nessus.\r\nThough consigned to perpetual membership in a body possessing no\r\noriginal influence in the State, and hemmed in by the usages of a mere\r\nrevisional council, he has now and then shown himself \"Harry Brougham\"\r\nstill. His speeches in the Lords on Parliamentary, legal, municipal, and\r\npoor laws Reform; on popular education; abolishing subscription in the\r\nuniversities; retrenchment; abolition of negro apprenticeship, and the\r\nAfrican and Eastern slave trade; Canadian independence; repeal of the\r\ncorn laws; and other topics, exhibit no abatement of intellectual power,\r\nor, so far as concerns those subjects, of regard for popular rights and\r\nsocial improvement. Indeed, some of them rank among his greatest and\r\nbest forensic displays. The speech on the education of the people in\r\n1835 contains as much valuable information, and that on negro\r\napprenticeship in 1838, as many eloquent passages, as any he ever\r\ndelivered.\r\n\r\nThe conflict with Melbourne in 1837-8, which threw him out of Court and\r\nWhig favor, was a matter of course, if not premeditated. In a speech at\r\nLiverpool, just after his resignation in 1835, he declared that \"his\r\nposition of absolute political independence\" would not be abandoned to\r\njoin or sustain any Ministry that did not stand by the people, and go\r\nfor large measures of reform. In 1837-8, on the Canada question, he\r\nfirst assailed the Melbourne Cabinet; he being for restoring peace to\r\nthe colony, by granting the petition of its Legislature for an elective\r\ncouncil, they for crushing disaffection by a dictator and the sword. His\r\ndefense of the Canadian reformers was generous, bold, radical, and\r\neloquent; worthy of the times when the young Commoner shook the Tory\r\nchiefs from the point of his lance, and fulminated living thunders at\r\nthe crowned despots of the Holy Alliance. Pointing his long finger at\r\nthe quailing Melbourne, he said, \"Do the Ministers desire to know what\r\nwill restore me to their support, and make me once more fight zealously\r\nin their ranks, as I once fought with them against the majority of your\r\nlordships? I will tell them here! Let them retract their declaration\r\nagainst Reform, delivered the first night of this session; and their\r\nsecond declaration, by which, to use the noble Viscount's phrase, they\r\n_exacerbated_ the first; or let them, without any retraction, only bring\r\nforward liberal and constitutional measures, and they will have no more\r\nzealous supporter than myself. But, in the mean time, I now hurl my\r\ndefiance at their heads!\"\r\n\r\nBut, the truth of history requires that another view be taken of these\r\ntransactions of 1835-8, and a far less eulogistic strain be employed in\r\nnoticing the course of Lord Brougham for the last ten or twelve years.\r\nEarly taught to admire him as the gallant leader of English reformers,\r\nit is painful to say, that during this period his conduct has been\r\nfrequently such as to forfeit the esteem and confidence of his friends\r\non both sides of the Atlantic, and to give currency to the charge that\r\nhis line of action has been caused by chagrin at being left out of the\r\nMelbourne ministry, and to strengthen the suspicion that his\r\ndenunciations of that Administration for faltering in the work of reform\r\nwere dictated by mortified pride and thwarted ambition. For five or six\r\nyears subsequent to 1835, he frequently attacked men and principles\r\nwhich he had won all his fame by previously advocating. But, it must not\r\nbe forgotten, that, though supported by neither party and assailed by\r\nboth, and set upon by Tory terriers and Whig whipsters, which betrayed\r\nhim into losses of temper and dignity, it was in these years that he\r\ncarried through Parliament several valuable reforms; whilst his\r\nwritings--those records for the perusal of posterity--exhibited no\r\nmarked change in his regard for liberal institutions.\r\n\r\nOn the return of the Tories to power, in 1841, he made a still wider\r\ndeparture from his early path. He has since shown much acerbity of\r\ntemper, given his vote quite as often to the opponents as to the friends\r\nof reform, and has succeeded in alienating the affections of many of\r\nthose who adhered to him during the Melbourne Administration. He has\r\nbeen alternately wayward, sour, vindictive, bold, brilliant, noble;\r\nexciting the contempt and fears of his enemies, and the disgust and\r\nadmiration of his friends; now cracking a joke on the Duke of\r\nWellington, that set the House in a roar, and then pounding the head of\r\nMelbourne till its chambers rang again; playing off eccentricities on\r\nsome railway bill for the amusement of Punch, while sending to press a\r\nwork on Voltaire and Rousseau that astonished Paris; giving his cheering\r\nvoice to the repeal of the corn laws, and his growling \"non-content\"\r\nagainst the repeal of the navigation laws; making himself ridiculous by\r\ntrying to force his way into the French National Convention, and being\r\nreceived with loud plaudits as he entered the hall of the French\r\nNational Institute; now losing and then winning the favor of the people;\r\nand ever and anon silencing the cry that \"his powers were failing,\" by\r\npronouncing a speech that startled the walls of St. Stephen's, and made\r\nevery hilltop and valley in the land echo back the shout, \"Brougham is\r\nhimself again!\"\r\n\r\nIt was a remark of Madame de Stael, that \"Foreigners are a kind of\r\ncotemporaneous posterity.\" Americans may therefore pass an unbiased\r\njudgment upon the character of Lord Brougham. When his imperfections are\r\nforgotten in the grave, and the mists of prejudice and of party are\r\ncleared away, Posterity, which generously throws a vail over the follies\r\nand frailties of genius, will not willingly withhold from his tomb the\r\nepitaph he coveted in one of his earliest speeches--\"HERE LIES THE\r\nDEFENDER OF LIBERTY, THE ADVOCATE OF PEACE, THE FRIEND OF THE PEOPLE!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n     Charles, Earl Grey--Advocates Abolition of the Slave Trade--His\r\n     Rise to Power--His Aid in Carrying the Reform Bill--Sydney Smith's\r\n     Eulogy--His Two Great Measures, Parliamentary Reform and Abolition\r\n     of Slavery--The Old and New Whigs--The \"Coming Man.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA sketch of Modern English Reformers, which should omit special mention\r\nof CHARLES, EARL GREY, would be defective. For fifty eventful years, he\r\ntook an active part in public affairs, and, with scarcely an exception,\r\nwas found on the liberal side. With a mind cast in a highly polished,\r\nbut not extraordinarily capacious mold, and in the attributes of\r\noriginality and genius dwindling by the side of Fox and Brougham, he\r\nfully equaled either of these great men in calm sagacity and firmness of\r\npurpose. And if his oratory was not of the bold and vigorous type which\r\nmarked theirs, it was of a high order; graceful, flowing, and classical,\r\nand set off by a manner always dignified, and in his younger days\r\npeculiarly fascinating.\r\n\r\nEntering Parliament in 1786, when he had just reached majority, he\r\nimmediately distinguished himself by a speech in opposition to the\r\npolicy of Mr. Pitt. His rapid rise in the House is attested by the fact,\r\nthat two years after his entrance, he was thought fit to occupy a place\r\non the committee for the impeachment of Warren Hastings, by the side of\r\nBurke, Fox, Wyndham, and Sheridan. The year before, he had given a\r\nremarkable exhibition of the firmness and integrity which formed so\r\nstriking a feature in his future life. In the debate on the Prince of\r\nWales' (George IV) debts, Mr. Fox, by direction of the Prince, had\r\ndenied, in his place, the marriage of the Prince with Mrs. Fitzherbert.\r\nThe lady was sorely offended. She must be appeased by a public\r\nexplanation. Wales applied to Grey to make some ambiguous statement in\r\nthe House, which, without contradicting Fox, might seem to her to do so.\r\nGrey contemptuously refused to be the instrument of the royal debauchee,\r\nwhich ever after made him his enemy.\r\n\r\nIn 1792, he joined with Whitbread, Erskine, Francis, Sheridan, and\r\nCartwright, in organizing the society for Parliamentary reform, called\r\n\"The Friends of the People,\" and the same year sustained their petition\r\nin the House by a radical speech, in which he declared, rather than\r\nsubmit to the existing system of representation, he would adopt\r\nuniversal suffrage.\r\n\r\nHe was a member of the Grenville-Fox ministry--ably advocated its great\r\nmeasure of the abolition of the slave trade--and, on the death of Fox,\r\nassumed his post as Foreign Secretary, with the lead of the Commons. An\r\nattempt to carry a bill to open the army and navy to Roman Catholics\r\nprovoked a quarrel with the bigoted old King, which threw out the\r\nministry, and brought forth Sydney Smith's immortal Peter Plymley\r\nLetters. The death of his father the next year (1807) removed him to the\r\nHouse of Lords, where, during the following twenty-three years of royal\r\nproscription, his voice was ever heard defending the drooping cause of\r\nhuman freedom.\r\n\r\nHis rise to power, and the circumstances under which his ministry\r\ncarried the Reform bill, have been detailed. The calm courage of the\r\nPremier steered the Government safely through this unprecedented\r\ntempest. Nerves less firm would have relinquished the helm in\r\ntrepidation--an eye less steady would, by some precipitous movement,\r\nhave whelmed all in destruction. On that memorable night, when the\r\ngalleries, and lobbies, and every passage leading to \"the tapestried\r\nchamber,\" were crowded with anxious spectators, and the venerable\r\nbuilding itself was besieged with excited throngs, representing all\r\nstations in society and all shades in politics, who had come up to the\r\nmetropolis from every part of the kingdom, to witness the decision of\r\nthe long-pending struggle between the people and the patricians, Earl\r\nGrey, with a dignity and solemn earnestness befitting the august\r\noccasion, told the ancient nobility of Britain, that \"though he was\r\nproud of the rank to which they in common belonged, and would peril much\r\nto save it from ruin, yet if they were determined to reject that bill,\r\nand throw it scornfully back in the faces of an aroused and determined\r\npeople, he warned them to set their houses speedily in order, for their\r\nhour had come!\" History has recorded the result of that appeal. The\r\nvassal rose up a man--the man stood forth an elector. The majesty of the\r\nsubject was asserted, and the hereditary rulers of England swore\r\nallegiance to the principle, \"the People are the legitimate source of\r\nPower.\" Never did popular agitation, wielding the peaceful weapons of\r\ntruth, more brilliantly display its superiority over physical force, and\r\nthe enginery of war, in accomplishing a great and salutary revolution.\r\n\r\nSydney Smith, speaking of Earl Grey, at a Reform meeting, while the bill\r\nwas pending, said: \"You are directed by a minister who prefers character\r\nto place, and who has given such unequivocal proofs of honesty and\r\npatriotism, that his image ought to be amongst your household gods, and\r\nhis name to be lisped by your children. Two thousand years hence it will\r\nbe a legend like the fable of Perseus and Andromeda; Britannia chained\r\nto a mountain--two hundred rotten animals[4] menacing her destruction,\r\ntill a tall Earl, armed with Schedule A,[5] and followed by his page,\r\nRussell, drives them into the deep, and delivers over Britannia in\r\nsafety to crowds of ten-pound renters, who deafen the air with their\r\nacclamations. Forthwith, Latin verses upon this--school exercises--boys\r\nwhipt, and all the usual absurdities of education.\"\r\n\r\n  [4] Rotten Boroughs.\r\n\r\n  [5] The List of disfranchised boroughs.\r\n\r\nThis is rather rapturous; but it is only Smith's way of expressing the\r\nunquestionable fact, that Earl Grey was the very man who could, if\r\nmortal man could, carry such a measure in the face of the aristocracy of\r\nEngland. The people trusted him, and the sane portion of the hostile\r\nfactions opposed him less obstinately than they would some more\r\nboisterous member of the liberal party, whom they could stigmatize as a\r\n\"fanatic,\" or a \"revolutionist.\" And even \"the radicals\" well knew, that\r\nto make a brilliant onslaught upon a strong Tory ministry, while the\r\nReform party was weak, and it mattered little _what_ was said and done,\r\nif _something_ was only said and done, was a very different mission from\r\nattempting to lead that party when its swelled ranks required to be\r\nconsolidated under a graver chieftain, with experience ripened by once\r\nhaving been a leading minister of the Crown, who might plant the\r\nconquering flag on the walls of the citadel. Such a chieftain was Earl\r\nGrey.\r\n\r\nThe two measures of Earl Grey's administration, which made it honorably\r\nconspicuous through the world, and will give it an enduring name with\r\nposterity, are Parliamentary reform, and the abolition of negro slavery.\r\nThe defects in the former will be hereafter alluded to. The latter was\r\nclogged by the ill-contrived apprenticeship system. But, defective\r\nthough they were, had his administration done nothing more for reform,\r\nthe glory of those would atone for all its errors of omission and\r\ncommission. The measure by whose magic touch eight hundred thousand\r\nslaves leaped to freedom, and bestowed the munificent gift of twenty\r\nmillions sterling upon their masters, gave his Government greater renown\r\nabroad than the reform in Parliament. But the latter was much the more\r\nimportant event to the British nation. It was an era in its politics,\r\nbig with present and future consequences. By bestowing the elective\r\nfranchise on half a million of small traders and artisans in the cities\r\nand towns, it struck a blow at the landed monopoly from which it can\r\nnever recover--subjected the Government more directly to the influence\r\nof public opinion--and opened the doors of Parliament to a new class of\r\nmen, like Cobden, Bright, and Thompson, springing from and sympathizing\r\nwith the people, who, by their services within and beyond the walls of\r\nthe legislature, have left their enduring mark on the policy of the\r\ncountry. By recognizing the principle of representation, as opposed to\r\nprescription, it took the first step toward complete suffrage for the\r\npeople, uniform representation in the House of Commons, and the election\r\nof the House of Peers. It was as worthy to be called a _revolution_ as\r\nthe event that deposed the Stuarts and enthroned William of Orange.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact in political and personal history, that the man,\r\nwho, in the freshness of youth and in the face of popular clamor,\r\nbroached the measure of Parliamentary reform, should, forty years\r\nafterwards, in the maturity of age, be selected to lead the people in\r\nits consummation. The fitting counterpart is the no less striking fact,\r\nthat the very Prince by whose choice he completed this work, and who,\r\nabout the period of its commencement, denounced Wilberforce as worthy of\r\nexpulsion from Parliament for proposing the abolition of the slave\r\ntrade, lived long enough to give his royal assent, in the presence of\r\nthat Wilberforce, to a bill for the abolition of slavery itself.\r\n\r\nEarl Grey may be regarded as the last of his political school. He was a\r\nsingular compound of the aristocracy of the old Whigs, with the\r\nliberality of the new. The trusted leader of the popular party, in the\r\nhour of its first triumph, cherished an exalted opinion of what he\r\ntermed \"his order,\" and though he never shrank from any duty or peril in\r\nsupport of the common cause, and voluntarily shared in the long\r\nexclusion of all grades of reformers from office and court favor, his\r\npride and austerity were so habitual as to cool his friends while they\r\nexasperated his foes. In exclusiveness and aristocratic bearing, he\r\nseemed to belong to the Whigs of the times of the first two Georges. On\r\nthe other hand, he exhibited, in his political sympathies, associations,\r\nand conduct all the democratic tendencies of the Whigs of the Fox and\r\nRussell school.\r\n\r\nThe old Whigs, of whom Walpole and Grafton were the type, were\r\ndistinguished by large possessions, long titles, and \"a landed air.\" By\r\narrogance, gold, and skill, they ruled England from the death of Queen\r\nAnne to the ascension of Lord North. Then arose the new Whigs, whose\r\ntype was Fox and Grenville. Their chief supporters came from bustling\r\nmanufacturing towns and flourishing seaports, as those of the old came\r\nfrom rural districts and rotten boroughs; the sign of the one being the\r\nbroadcloth of the stock exchange; of the other, the broad acres of the\r\nagricultural counties. Indeed, on the coming in of the younger Pitt,\r\nparties might be said to have changed places without changing names; the\r\nTories assuming the power of the old Whigs, and like them ruling _over_\r\nthe people; whilst the old disappeared, and the new arose in the place\r\nof the ascendant Tories, and assuming the Tory attitude of opposition,\r\nand basing it on _quasi_ democratic principles, struggled for power\r\n_with_ the people.\r\n\r\nGrey's administration was the reign of the new Whigs. It was continued\r\nby Melbourne; but the species is now almost extinct. Another party has\r\ngradually arisen, from seeds sown long ago by liberal hands. It knew not\r\nthe ancient Whigs; it regards not the modern. Its type is Cobden and\r\nHume, with symptoms of affinity in such noblemen as the present Carlisle\r\nand Grey. It once looked forward to the day when its leader and Premier\r\nwould be Earl Durham. What remained of this hope after his unlucky\r\nCanadian administration, was soon quenched in his grave. It had now\r\nbetter select its chief man from the ranks of the people, and put him in\r\ntraining; for, after a lapse of time, and John Russell, it must rule\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n     Abolition of Negro Slavery--Canning's Resolutions of\r\n     1823--Insurrection in Demerara--\"Missionary Smith's\r\n     Case\"--Immediate Abolition--Elizabeth\r\n     Heyrick--O'Connell--Brougham's Celebrated Speech of\r\n     1830--Insurrection and Anarchy in Jamaica, in 1832--William\r\n     Knibb--Parliamentary Inquiry--Buxton--The Apprenticeship Adopted,\r\n     August, 1833--Result of Complete Emancipation in Antigua--The\r\n     Apprenticeship Doomed--The Colonies themselves Terminate it, August\r\n     1, 1838.\r\n\r\n\r\nDickens, in his Martin Chuzzlewit, records, that Miss Charity Pecksniff,\r\nbeing told her side face was much better-looking than the front view,\r\never after, when visited by her not very numerous suitors, presented her\r\nprofile to their admiring gaze. The tribute which Great Britain has paid\r\nto the genius of Humanity, by her efforts and sacrifices for the\r\nabolition of the African Slave Trade and Negro Slavery, is the aspect in\r\nwhich she delights to be contemplated by other nations. The humblest\r\nEnglishman is proud to reiterate the sentiment, uttered half a century\r\nago by Curran: \"I speak in the spirit of our Constitution, which makes\r\nLiberty commensurate with and inseparable from our soil; which\r\nproclaims, even to the stranger and the sojourner, the moment he sets\r\nhis foot upon our native earth, that the ground he treads is holy, and\r\nconsecrated by the genius of Universal Emancipation. No matter in what\r\nlanguage his doom may have been pronounced; no matter what complexion,\r\nincompatible with freedom, an Indian or an African sun may have burnt\r\nupon him; no matter in what disastrous battle his liberty may have been\r\ncloven down; no matter with what solemnities he may have been devoted\r\non the altar of slavery: the first moment he touches our sacred soil,\r\nthe altar and the god sink together in the dust; his soul walks abroad\r\nin her own majesty; his body swells beyond the measure of his chains,\r\nthat burst around him; and he stands redeemed, regenerated, and\r\ndisenthralled, by the irresistible genius of Universal Emancipation.\"\r\nThe services and victories of Sharpe, Clarkson, Wilberforce, Stephen,\r\nBrougham, Macaulay, Buxton, Cropper, Lushington, Gurney, Sturge,\r\nO'Connell, Mackintosh, Thompson, Wardlaw, Scoble, and their\r\nfellow-laborers, in this department of philanthropy, mitigate the\r\nabhorrence with which Christendom views the continued oppressions of\r\nmillions of British subjects in both hemispheres.\r\n\r\nAfter the abolition of the slave trade, the attention of a few\r\nthoughtful and humane persons was turned toward slavery itself, of which\r\nthe trade was only an incident. Public sentiment was gradually enlisted,\r\ntill, in 1823, it had become sufficiently aroused to cause the passage,\r\nin Parliament, of Mr. Canning's celebrated resolutions, declaring the\r\nexpediency of adopting decisive measures for meliorating the condition\r\nof the slave population in the Colonies, preparatory to their complete\r\nemancipation. A ministerial circular was sent to the Colonies, directing\r\nthe authorities to act upon those resolutions in the future treatment of\r\nthe slave population. But, as was predicted by those who had studied the\r\ngenius of Slavery, the resolutions and circular were either\r\ncontemptuously defied, coolly disregarded, or courteously evaded by the\r\nColonies.\r\n\r\nThe latter part of the same year, an insurrection broke out in Demerara.\r\nThe infuriated planters undertook to trace its origin to the religious\r\nteachings of a venerable English missionary of most pure and exemplary\r\ncharacter, Rev. John Smith. He was seized, and, after resisting some\r\nattempts to extort confessions, and going through a trial in which the\r\nvery semblance of justice was outraged, was convicted, and sentenced to\r\ndeath. In feeble health, he was thrown into a small and loathsome\r\ndungeon, where, after several weeks of intense suffering, he died. This\r\nattempt to\r\n\r\n              \"----bring back\r\n  The Hall of Horrors, and the assessor's pen\r\n  Recording answers shrieked upon the rack,\"\r\n\r\nproduced a tremendous sensation in England. Early in June, Mr. Brougham\r\nintroduced into Parliament a motion to censure the Government and Court\r\nof Demerara. A debate of surpassing interest followed, in which he\r\nsupported his motion by two powerful speeches. It was on this occasion\r\nthat Mr. Wilberforce made his last speech in Parliament. The motion was\r\nlost by a small majority.\r\n\r\nThese proceedings, touching a case of individual outrage, are worthy of\r\nspecial note, because they aroused a spirit in England that would never\r\n\"down,\" till the last chain was stricken from the last slave. \"The\r\nMissionary Smith's Case\" became a rallying cry with all the friends of\r\nreligious freedom, and all the enemies of West India slavery. The\r\nmeasures of the Abolitionists became more bold--their principles\r\ncommanded a more general concurrence--those who voted against the motion\r\nof Mr. Brougham were either excluded from the next Parliament, or\r\nobtained their seats with extreme difficulty; and, to quote from the\r\npreface to Mr. B.'s speeches, \"All men now saw that the warning given in\r\nthe peroration of the latter, though sounded in vain across the Atlantic\r\nOcean, was echoing with a loudness redoubled with each repetition\r\nthrough the British isles; that it had rung the knell of the system; and\r\nthat at the fetters of the slave a blow was at length struck, which\r\nmust, if followed up, make them fall off his limbs forever.\"\r\n\r\nThe year 1830 was memorable for a great advance in the principles of the\r\nAbolitionists, and the influence they exerted on public opinion. The\r\ndoctrine of _immediate_ as opposed to _gradual_ abolition, had been set\r\nforth in a well-reasoned pamphlet, published anonymously, in 1824,\r\nwhich was afterward found to have been written by Elizabeth Heyrick, of\r\nLeicester. It now became the watchword of the Anti-Slavery Societies,\r\ntheir publications and orators. The anniversary meeting of the\r\nmetropolitan association in this year was addressed by some of the most\r\ndistinguished men in the kingdom. It was on this occasion that Daniel\r\nO'Connell uttered the noble and comprehensive sentiment--\"I am for\r\nspeedy, immediate abolition. I care not what caste, creed, or color,\r\nSlavery may assume. I am for its total, its instant abolition. Whether\r\nit be personal or political, mental or corporeal, intellectual or\r\nspiritual, I am for its immediate abolition. I enter into no compromise\r\nwith Slavery; I am for justice, in the name of humanity, and according\r\nto the law of the living God.\"\r\n\r\nIn July of the same year, Mr. Brougham introduced his motion in the\r\nCommons, just before the dissolution, pledging the House to take the\r\nsubject of Abolition into consideration early the next session. His\r\nspeech in its support, and which essentially contributed to his election\r\nfor Yorkshire a few weeks afterward, as the successor of Wilberforce,\r\ncontains the oft-cited passage: \"I trust that at length the time is come\r\nwhen Parliament will no longer bear to be told that slave-owners are the\r\nbest lawgivers on Slavery; no longer allow an appeal from the British\r\npublic to such communities as those in which the Smiths and the\r\nGrimsdalls are persecuted to death for teaching the gospel to the\r\nnegroes; and the Mosses holden in affectionate respect for torture and\r\nmurder: no longer suffer our voice to roll across the Atlantic in empty\r\nwarnings and fruitless orders. Tell me not of rights--talk not of the\r\nproperty of the planter in his slaves. I deny the right--I acknowledge\r\nnot the property. The principles, the feelings of our common nature rise\r\nin rebellion against it. Be the appeal made to the understanding, or to\r\nthe heart, the sentence is the same that rejects it. In vain you tell me\r\nof laws that sanction such a crime! There is a law above all the\r\nenactments of human codes--the same throughout the world--the same in\r\nall times--such as it was before the daring genius of Columbus pierced\r\nthe night of ages, and opened to one world the sources of power, wealth,\r\nand knowledge; to another, all unutterable woes: such as it is at this\r\nday. It is the law written by the finger of God on the heart of man; and\r\nby that law unchangeable and eternal, while men despise fraud, and\r\nloathe rapine, and abhor blood, they will reject with indignation the\r\nwild and guilty fantasy, that man can hold property in man! In vain you\r\nappeal to treaties, to covenants between nations: the Covenants of the\r\nAlmighty, whether the Old Covenant or the New, denounce such unholy\r\npretensions. To those laws did they of old refer, who maintained the\r\nAfrican trade. Such treaties did they cite, and not untruly; for by one\r\nshameful compact you bartered the glories of Blenheim for the traffic in\r\nblood. Yet, despite of law and of treaty, that infernal traffic is now\r\ndestroyed, and its votaries put to death like other pirates. How came\r\nthis change to pass? Not, assuredly, by Parliament leading the way; but\r\nthe country at length awoke; the indignation of the people was kindled;\r\nit descended in thunder, and smote the traffic, and scattered its guilty\r\nprofits to the winds. Now, then, let the planters beware--let their\r\nAssemblies beware--let the Government at home beware--let the Parliament\r\nbeware! The same country is once more awake--awake to the condition of\r\nnegro slavery; the same indignation kindles in the bosom of the same\r\npeople; the same cloud is gathering that annihilated the slave trade;\r\nand, if it shall descend again, they on whom its crash may fall, will\r\nnot be destroyed before I have warned them; but I pray that their\r\ndestruction may turn away from us the more terrible judgments of God!\"\r\n\r\nThe French revolution of 1830, the turning out of the Wellington and the\r\ncoming in of the Grey Ministry, and the protracted contest for\r\nParliamentary reform, absorbed a large share of the public attention for\r\nthe next eighteen months. Meanwhile, the Abolitionists, taking\r\nadvantage of the liberal tendencies of the times, gathered strength by\r\nagitating the country through numerous publications and addresses, from\r\nsome of the most able pens and eloquent tongues in the kingdom.\r\n\r\nIn 1831-2, an outbreak in Jamaica inflamed the already excited mind of\r\nEngland to an unusual pitch. An attempt to deprive some of the negroes\r\nof their wonted Christmas holidays, conspired with a report that\r\nParliament had abolished slavery, to provoke a revolt. The masters fled,\r\nthe troops interfered and slaughtered a large number of the insurgents,\r\nleaving the courts to put to death a few hundred in a more leisurely\r\nway. Not content with this, the planters glutted their vengeance by\r\npulling down several chapels of the Baptist and Independent\r\nmissionaries--forbidding meetings for religious worship in which slaves\r\nparticipated--driving some of the ministers to the mountains, and\r\nhunting them like beasts of prey--throwing others into prison--whilst a\r\nmore fortunate few escaped to England. Among the latter was the Rev.\r\nWilliam Knibb, a Baptist preacher of heroic courage, commanding person\r\nand vigorous eloquence. Arriving in the mother country in June, 1832, he\r\nperambulated the island, and in conjunction with the more learned and\r\nbrilliant George Thompson, now member of Parliament, who was then\r\nemployed as an Anti-Slavery lecturer, stirred the national heart to its\r\ncore.\r\n\r\nParliament was not idle. In May, of this year, the West Indian interest\r\nin the House of Lords procured the appointment of a committee of inquiry\r\ninto the state of the islands. It was mainly composed of opponents of\r\nAbolition. The friends of liberty in the Commons, alarmed at this\r\nhostile proceeding, obtained, through their leader, Mr. T. Fowell\r\nBuxton, a committee to consider the expediency of abolishing slavery in\r\nthe islands. Mr. Buxton was chairman of the committee. These two\r\ncommittees were in session when the exiled Jamaica missionaries\r\narrived. They were examined as witnesses, with some sixty others,\r\nrepresenting both sides of the question--the inquiry extending through\r\nnearly three months. The result was, an overwhelming case against\r\nslavery. Both parties now girded themselves for the contest. The\r\nMinistry of Earl Grey had recently carried the Reform bill. It was a\r\nfavorable moment for the friends of freedom to strike. Early in the\r\nsession of 1833, Mr. Buxton was about to bring forward a motion for the\r\nimmediate abolition of slavery, when Mr. Stanley, the Colonial\r\nSecretary, superseded him, by pledging ministers to introduce a measure,\r\nwithout delay, which \"should be safe and satisfactory to all parties.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stanley brought out the Government plan of abolition, on the 14th of\r\nMay, 1833. Good, genial, and unsuspecting Mr. Buxton now wished he had\r\nkept the work in his own hands. Stanley's bill bore the stereotyped\r\nministerial stamp. It was a compromise between what justice demanded and\r\nwhat oppression would grant. It immediately emancipated all slaves under\r\nsix years of age; and subjected house servants to an apprenticeship of\r\nfour years, and agricultural servants of six years, to their former\r\nmasters; and gave to the latter a compensation of L20,000,000. At the\r\nend of the apprenticeship, the negroes were to be completely free.\r\n\r\nLeading Abolitionists denounced the scheme, compelled ministers to\r\nreduce the period of apprenticeship from twelve (as first proposed) to\r\nfour and six years, protested against compensation; but, fearful of\r\nlosing the boon, the majority finally yielded their opposition. In\r\nParliament, the measure was discussed to its dregs; the friends of\r\nimmediate Abolition striving to remedy its defects--the West India\r\ninterest contesting every clause and comma with heroic pertinacity.\r\nAfter vast rhetorical displays on all sides, with much patience and\r\nphilanthropy on one, and a good deal of bad temper and bad ethics,\r\nmingled with prophecies of bankruptcy and bloodshed on the other, the\r\nbill became a law on the 28th day of August, 1833. Mr. O'Connell voted\r\nagainst it, on the two grounds, that it did not give immediate freedom\r\nto the slaves, whilst it gave compensation to the masters.\r\n\r\nIn its actual workings, the apprenticeship realized most of the\r\nobjections made to it by the Abolitionists, and few of the horrible\r\nforebodings of their opponents. The instant transition of 800,000 slaves\r\ninto _quasi_ freemen was not attended by any disorder whatever. And\r\nduring the four years which the ill-contrived scheme lasted, not a drop\r\nof blood was shed; crimes of all grades diminished; vagrancy seldom\r\nshowed its head; property was respected; the adults banished many of\r\nthose domestic vices incident to a state of slavery; the children filled\r\nthe schools; and this class of West India society rose in the scale of\r\ncivilization and morals. And even after the forts were dismantled, and\r\nthe troops sent away to prevent an insurrection among the whites of\r\nCanada, the Anglo-Saxons in the Caribbean Isles slept on quiet pillows.\r\n\r\nBut, though a heaven-wide remove from slavery, the apprenticeship was\r\nnot a paradise to the parties. The dissonance was inherent in the nature\r\nof the plan. Looking to harmonious results, it gave the planters too\r\nmuch power, or too little; the negroes too much liberty, or too little.\r\nThe consequence was, interminable disputes between masters and\r\napprentices; between planters and special justices; between the Home\r\nGovernment and the Colonial authorities. The majority of the justices,\r\nwho had the chief agency in executing the Abolition act, endeavored to\r\ndo it in its humane spirit. But too many of them could not withstand the\r\nseductive wit and wine of a class, whose chivalry and hospitality are\r\nproverbial wherever unpaid labor has shed its liberalizing influences.\r\n\r\nAntigua and the Bermudas discarded the apprenticeship, and adopted\r\ncomplete abolition, the Act giving to the Colonies the alternative.\r\nExperience justified the wisdom of their choice. They reaped all the\r\ngood fruits of the apprenticeship, and none of the bad. Messrs. Thome\r\nand Kimball, of this country, visited Antigua, Barbadoes, and Jamaica,\r\nin 1837. From their admirable \"Six Months Tour,\" I quote the following\r\ndescription of the \"immediate\" conversion to men, of 30,000 slaves of\r\nAntigua, on the 1st of August, 1834:\r\n\r\n     \"For some time previous to the 1st of August, forebodings of\r\n     disaster lowered over the island. The day was fixed! Thirty\r\n     thousand degraded human beings were to be brought forth from the\r\n     dungeon of slavery, and 'turned loose on the community,' and this\r\n     was to be done 'in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye!' Gloomy\r\n     apprehensions were entertained by many of the planters. Some\r\n     timorous families did not go to bed on the night of the 31st of\r\n     July; fear drove sleep from their eyes, and they awaited with\r\n     fluttering pulse the hour of midnight, fearing lest the same bell\r\n     which sounded the jubilee of the slaves might toll the death-knell\r\n     of the masters. Several American vessels which had lain for weeks\r\n     in the harbor weighed anchor on the 31st of July, and made their\r\n     escape, through actual fear that the island would be destroyed on\r\n     the following day. * * * The Wesleyans kept 'watch night' in all\r\n     their chapels on the night of the 31st. At St. John's, the spacious\r\n     building was filled with the candidates for liberty. All was\r\n     animation and eagerness. A mighty chorus of voices swelled the song\r\n     of expectation and joy, and, as they united in prayer, the voice of\r\n     the leader was drowned in universal acclamations of thanksgiving,\r\n     and praise, and blessing, and honor, and glory to God, who had come\r\n     down for their deliverance. In such exercises the evening was spent\r\n     until the hour of twelve approached. The missionary then proposed\r\n     that, when the clock on the cathedral should begin to strike, the\r\n     whole congregation should fall upon their knees, and receive the\r\n     boon of freedom in silence. Accordingly, as the loud bell tolled\r\n     its first note, the immense assembly fell prostrate on their knees.\r\n     All was silence, save the quivering half-stifled breath of the\r\n     struggling spirit. The slow notes of the clock fell upon the\r\n     multitude; peal on peal, peal on peal, rolled over the prostrate\r\n     throng, in tones of angels' voices, thrilling among the desolate\r\n     chords and weary heart-strings. Scarce had the clock sounded its\r\n     last note, when the lightning flashed vividly around, and a loud\r\n     peal of thunder roared along the sky--God's pillar of fire and\r\n     trump of jubilee! A moment of profoundest silence passed--then\r\n     came the _burst_--they broke forth in prayer; they shouted, they\r\n     sung, 'Glory,' 'alleluia;' they clapped their hands, leaped up,\r\n     fell down, clasped each other in their free arms, cried, laughed,\r\n     went to and fro, tossing upward their unfettered hands; but high\r\n     above the whole there was a mighty sound, which ever and anon\r\n     swelled up; it was the utterings in broken negro dialect of\r\n     gratitude to God.\"\r\n\r\nThe experiment of immediate abolition in Antigua and the Bermudas, and\r\nof the apprenticeship in the other Colonies, has established the\r\nfollowing facts: That, while melioration is a great improvement on\r\nchattel slavery, yet immediate and complete emancipation is far\r\npreferable: That either change is safe to the person and property of the\r\nmaster: That, for either, it is rather the master than the slave who\r\nneeds preparation.\r\n\r\nConsiderations of principle, uniting with a mass of facts showing the\r\nsuperiority of immediate emancipation over the apprenticeship, induced\r\nthe Abolitionists of England, in 1836-7, to take a final stand for the\r\ncomplete disenthralment of the negro. A numerous Convention of delegates\r\nmet in London, in November, 1837; resolved that the apprenticeship\r\nshould cease on or before the first of August, 1838; memorialized the\r\nGovernment against its continuance; and, through a deputation, waited on\r\nthe Colonial Secretary, to enforce their appeal. They were coldly, not\r\nto say contemptuously, treated by Lord Glenelg. After selecting a\r\nCentral Committee, to watch the Ministry and Parliament, the delegates\r\nwent home to agitate the country. Thompson, Wardlaw, Smeal, and their\r\ncoadjutors, aroused Scotland; whilst Sturge, Buxton, Scoble, and their\r\nfriends, shook England. In the course of the fall and winter, petitions\r\npoured into Parliament in unprecedented numbers, whilst seven hundred\r\nthousand women presented their prayer to the Queen in behalf of her\r\noppressed female subjects in the Western isles.\r\n\r\nParliament began to move. On the 20th of February, 1838, Lord Brougham,\r\nin presenting a petition from Glasgow and vicinity, signed by upwards\r\nof 100,000 persons, moved a series of resolutions for the speedy\r\ntermination of the apprenticeship, supporting them by a speech worthy of\r\nhis brightest fame, and whose immediate publication produced a deep\r\nimpression upon the country. I cannot forbear quoting the closing\r\nparagraph of the peroration.\r\n\r\nSaid Lord Brougham:\r\n\r\n     \"So now the fullness of time is come for at length discharging our\r\n     duty to the African captive. I have demonstrated to you that\r\n     everything is ordered--every previous step taken--all safe, by\r\n     experience shown to be all safe, for the long-desired consummation.\r\n     The time has come, the trial has been made, the hour is striking:\r\n     you have no longer a pretext for hesitation, or faltering, or\r\n     delay. The slave has shown, by four years' blameless behavior and\r\n     devotion to the pursuits of peaceful industry, that he is as fit\r\n     for his freedom as any English peasant--aye, or any lord whom I now\r\n     address. I demand his rights; I demand his liberty without stint.\r\n     In the name of justice and of law, in the name of reason, in the\r\n     name of God, who has given you no right to work injustice, I demand\r\n     that your brother be no longer trampled upon as your slave! I make\r\n     my appeal to the Commons, who represent the free people of England,\r\n     and I require at their hands the performance of that condition for\r\n     which they paid so enormous a price--that condition which all their\r\n     constituents are in breathless anxiety to see fulfilled! I appeal\r\n     to this House. Hereditary judges of the first tribunal in the\r\n     world, to you I appeal for justice! Patrons of all the arts that\r\n     humanize mankind, under your protection I place humanity herself!\r\n     To the merciful Sovereign of a free people, I call aloud for mercy\r\n     to the hundreds of thousands for whom half a million of her\r\n     Christian sisters have cried aloud; I ask that their cry may not\r\n     have risen in vain. But first I turn my eye to the Throne of all\r\n     Justice, and devoutly humbling myself before Him who is of purer\r\n     eyes than to behold such vast iniquities, I implore that the curse\r\n     hovering over the head of the unjust and oppressor be averted from\r\n     us--that your hearts may be turned to mercy--and that over all the\r\n     earth His will may at length be done.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of March, Sir George Strickland brought forward a motion in\r\nthe Commons, for the termination of the apprenticeship on the 1st of\r\nAugust following. Ministers resisted, and it was lost. While the motion\r\nwas pending, two large anti-slavery conventions met in London, and soon\r\nafterwards five thronged meetings were held in Exeter Hall, in whose\r\nproceedings Brougham, Buxton, O'Connell, and other distinguished men,\r\nplayed a prominent part. The obstinate course of the Cabinet had not\r\nonly exasperated public opinion at home, but had produced a feverish\r\nexcitement amongst the apprentices in the Colonies.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this furious contest, whose issue was shrouded in\r\ndarkness, light suddenly broke in from an unexpected quarter. Lo! a\r\nministerial dispatch, dated the very day after the November convention\r\nmet, appeared in the West India newspapers, addressed to the Colonial\r\nGovernors, in which Lord Glenelg informed them that agitation had again\r\ncommenced, and would no doubt go on as before, and urging them to\r\nimpress on the Legislatures the necessity of doing for themselves, and\r\nin season, what the people of England were seeking to compel the\r\nParliament to do for them. Thus the Cabinet, while presenting a bold\r\nfront at home, was saving its life by indirectly and secretly doing the\r\nwork Abolitionists were forcing it to perform.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the arrival in England of the journals containing\r\ncopies of the dispatch, came the news, that the two small islands of\r\nMontserrat and Nevis had yielded to the ministerial solicitation, and\r\nresolved to emancipate their apprentices on the 1st of August. Other\r\nsmall islands soon copied their example. Barbadoes, with her 83,000\r\napprentices, followed in the train. Then came Jamaica, with her 330,000.\r\nThis settled the question. Other Colonies now gave way, and ministers\r\npledged themselves that all should be completed by the appointed day. It\r\nwas done--the Cabinet averted an inglorious defeat--the planters escaped\r\na hurricane of violence in a dark night of negro insurrection--and, on\r\nthe first day of August, 1838, the friends of emancipation assembled in\r\nall parts of the Empire, to render thanksgiving to God for the final\r\noverthrow of British negro slavery.\r\n\r\nThe great work of 1834 and 1838, which we have hastily scanned, was\r\naccomplished by the People, and not by the Government; by the Democracy,\r\nas distinguished from the Aristocracy--the latter moving only when\r\nimpelled by the former. Of political parties, the large share of\r\nAbolitionists came from the liberals. Of religious sects, the most\r\nactive were the Friends, the Baptists, and the Independents. The cry\r\noccasionally heard in this country, that the abolition of West India\r\nSlavery was intended to be an indirect blow at American republicanism,\r\nis the shallow cant of owlish ignorance or demagogical hypocrisy. The\r\nEnglishmen who bore a prominent part in the Abolition cause, generally\r\nadmire our free institutions, and are now efficient laborers in those\r\nreforms which aim to cripple the power of the privileged orders, to\r\nprevent class legislation, and to secure the equal rights of the masses\r\nof their countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the emancipated negroes during the last ten years has\r\njustified the eulogium pronounced upon them by Lord Brougham, in the\r\nlast of the two quotations from him. The magistrate has driven out the\r\noverseer; the school has taken the place of the whipping-post; the press\r\nhas supplanted the tread-mill. It is said that the large landed estates\r\nare diminishing in value; that the quantity of sugar, coffee, and rum,\r\nannually produced, decreases; that the negroes are reluctant to labor\r\nupon these large properties, preferring to set up little shops, or work\r\nat trades, or cultivate small grounds on their own account. In the mass\r\nof conflicting testimony, it is difficult to get at the precise facts. I\r\npresume that, to a large extent, these reports are true. Monopolies in\r\nthe flesh of man, and in the soil he tills, are at war with Nature and\r\nwith God. If they have been long continued, a change will produce some\r\nbitter fruits. But they will be the growth of the evil rather than the\r\nremedy. The tropics belong to the colored race. The Saxon must abandon\r\nthe West Indies. His huge landed estates must inevitably continue to\r\ndiminish in value till they are broken up into small freeholds, each\r\nbeing cultivated by its individual owner. Such a consummation will be\r\ndeprecated only by those who believe that the chief end of poor men, in\r\nhot climates, is to work as day-laborers, on small wages, for bloated\r\ncapitalists, in the production of large quantities of cotton, coffee,\r\nsugar, and rum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n     Notices of some Prominent Abolitionists--T. Fowell Buxton--Zachary\r\n     Macaulay--Joseph Sturge--William Allen--James Cropper--Joseph and\r\n     Samuel Gurney--George William Alexander--Thomas Pringle--Charles\r\n     Stuart--John Scoble--George Thompson--Rev. Dr. Thomson--Rev. Dr.\r\n     Wardlaw--Rev. Dr. Ritchie--Rev. Mr. James--Rev. Messrs. Hinton,\r\n     Brock, Bevan, and Burnet.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Fowell Buxton was the Abolition leader in the House of\r\nCommons during the Anti-Slavery conflicts of 1832 and 1833. His life is\r\na beautiful illustration of Solomon's saying, \"Train up a child in the\r\nway he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.\" At six\r\nyears of age, Thomas lost his father; but there was left to him that\r\nmost valuable of blessings, a vigorous-minded, well-educated, virtuous\r\nmother, who watched his young days with pains-taking solicitude. He was\r\nnaturally of a sportive, roving disposition, and, when at school or\r\ncollege, made rather greater proficiency in the practice of hunting and\r\nfishing than in the study of mathematics and the languages. Though his\r\njuvenile tastes led him to scatter large quantities of that erratic\r\ngrain called \"wild oats,\" the teachings of his mother inclined his\r\nmaturer years to the cultivation of the more profitable fields of\r\nHumanity and Philanthropy. The training of the child was shown in the\r\nactions of the man. Mr. Buxton's public life was devoted to meliorating\r\nthe condition of the unfortunate classes of society. Especially was he\r\nthe friend of prisoners, criminals and slaves. While a young man, he\r\ntook a lively interest in Prison Discipline--published a work on that\r\nsubject in 1816, being the result of observations in the prisons of\r\nFrance and Belgium--and having taken his seat in the Commons in 1819,\r\njoined Mackintosh in his efforts to limit the death-penalty, and soften\r\nother severe features of the criminal code.\r\n\r\nSurrounded by a strong Quaker influence from his youth, his mother being\r\na Friend, which was subsequently increased by his marriage with a sister\r\nof the Gurneys and Mrs. Elizabeth Fry, (he had been accompanied by J. J.\r\nGurney and Mrs. F. in his continental tour,) Mr. Buxton's mind was early\r\nturned toward the state of slavery in the Colonies. In 1821, (I think,)\r\nimmediately after he had delivered an able speech in the House on Prison\r\nDiscipline, Mr. Wilberforce wrote him an earnest letter, alluding to his\r\nown services in abolishing the slave trade, and requesting Buxton to\r\njoin him in \"a truly holy alliance\" for meliorating the condition of the\r\nnegro slaves, and ultimately advancing them to the rank of a free\r\npeasantry; and, in view of his advancing years, solicited Buxton to\r\nbecome his successor in \"the blessed service,\" when increasing\r\ninfirmities should compel him to relinquish the lead to younger hands.\r\nMr. Buxton at once threw his mind and heart into the work, and his\r\nsubsequent ability and devotion to it justified the compliment of\r\nWilberforce, a few years afterward, when he called him his\r\n\"Parliamentary Executor.\"\r\n\r\nThe resolutions of 1823, which have already been mentioned, were moved\r\nby Mr. Canning, as an amendment to a more radical proposition introduced\r\nby Mr. Buxton. To him, therefore, humanity is indebted for the first\r\nimportant ministerial step towards Abolition, which was the precursor of\r\nall that followed till the end was attained. It is with reference to the\r\ndebate on this occasion, I believe, that the anecdote is told of\r\n\"Brougham helping Buxton, and Buxton helping Brougham.\" Buxton was to\r\nmove the proposition, and Brougham was to second him. Due notice had\r\nbeen given, and the West India interest was in commotion. Buxton\r\nanticipated that an attempt would be made to cough and scrape him\r\ndown--not an unusual practice in this \"assembly of the first gentlemen\r\nin the world.\" Just as Buxton was rising, Brougham whispered to him, \"I\r\nwill cheer _you_ with all my might, and then you must cheer _me_.\"\r\n\"Agreed!\" responded the agitated brewer, who, in the suppressed\r\nmutterings and growlings, saw a storm was brewing. But he went on,\r\nBrougham crying \"Hear! hear! hear!\" so vigorously, and stamping and\r\ncheering so lustily, that the West Indians were dumb with wonder, and\r\npermitted Buxton to finish his speech without much interruption. Mr.\r\nCanning replied in his adroit and elegant style, moved his amendment,\r\nand resumed his seat under cheers from all sides. Brougham sprang to his\r\nfeet, full of excitement with the great theme. Members cried, \"Divide!\r\ndivide!\" in deafening tones. But Harry stood firm, lifted his voice\r\nabove the tempest, and began to roll out long sentences crowded with big\r\nthoughts, while Buxton's shouts of \"Hear! hear! hear!\" finally silenced\r\nthe clamor, when, his cheers of the matchless eloquence of his colleague\r\nbecoming contagious, Brougham wound up a great speech amid \"thunders of\r\napplause.\"\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated, that in May, 1832, on motion of Mr. Buxton,\r\na committee was appointed in the Commons, to inquire and report upon the\r\nmost expedient measures for the extinction of slavery throughout the\r\nBritish dominions. His labors as chairman of this committee, of which\r\nLord John Russell, Sir Robert Peel, and other distinguished statesmen,\r\nwere members, whose sittings did not terminate till August, were\r\nindefatigable, and worthy of the highest praise. His permitting the\r\nreins of leadership in this measure to slip into the hands of the\r\ncompromising Colonial Secretary, the next spring, was censured by some\r\nAbolitionists. But no man strove more earnestly than he to remedy the\r\ndefects in the ministerial plan. He repeatedly divided the House on\r\namendments, and succeeded in reducing the period of apprenticeship\r\none-half. And any ground which he might have lost by the transactions of\r\n1833, was nobly redeemed by his subsequent services in bringing to an\r\nend a system, which, at the outset, he had denounced as \"unjust in\r\nprinciple, indefensible in policy, and anomalous, unnatural, and\r\nunnecessary.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the abolition of the apprenticeship, Mr. Buxton turned his\r\nattention to the slave trade. In June, 1839, he instituted the \"Society\r\nfor the Extinction of the Slave Trade and the Civilization of Africa,\"\r\nand was appointed its chairman. The same year, he brought out an\r\nelaborate work on \"The Slave Trade and its Remedy,\" which was followed\r\nthe next year by an enlarged edition, extending to some 600 pages. It is\r\nthe most valuable and authentic publication extant on that subject. The\r\nfacts it detailed, as to the extent of the traffic, astonished all who\r\npaid any attention to what Mr. Pitt had denominated \"the greatest\r\npractical evil that ever afflicted mankind.\" While for a quarter of a\r\ncentury \"the triumphs of humanity in the abolition of the African slave\r\ntrade\" had rounded the periods of orators in the British Senate and on\r\nthe rock of Plymouth, Mr. Buxton proves that in 1840, and for a long\r\nperiod before, the victims of the traffic were more numerous, and its\r\nfeatures more grim and gory than when Clarkson entered upon his\r\nphilanthropic work in 1786. If Mr. Buxton had done nothing more, during\r\nhis life, than to open the eyes of deluded Christendom to the present\r\nextent of this atrocious piracy, he would be entitled to the thanks of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nThe publication of his volume stimulated the British Government to\r\ngreater efforts for bringing the traffic to an end. Though his main\r\nremedy, the civilization of Africa, showed a comprehensive and\r\nbenevolent mind, the African expeditions undertaken in accordance with\r\nhis plan were less successful than he fondly anticipated; and many of\r\nthe best-informed persons became firmly fixed in the opinion, that the\r\nonly effectual remedy for the slave trade is the complete abolition of\r\nslavery itself, and that anything short of this is amelioration, and not\r\nextermination. While it is believed that Mr. Buxton never abandoned his\r\nfavorite plan, yet, till the close of his laborious and philanthropic\r\nlife, he was the steady friend of all efforts for the overthrow of\r\nslavery and the slave trade throughout the world.\r\n\r\nMr. Buxton possessed large wealth, which he liberally devoted to the\r\npromotion of benevolent enterprises--had a clear and capacious mind,\r\nwell stocked with useful knowledge--was ever under the influence of a\r\nliberal heart and catholic spirit--and his majestic form, he being about\r\nsix feet and a half in hight, gave impressive dignity to the lucid style\r\nin which he presented his subject, whether pleading for justice and\r\nmercy before an adverse House of Commons, or surrounded by applauding\r\nthousands in Exeter Hall.\r\n\r\nNext to Mr. Buxton, if indeed he was not in advance of him, Mr. ZACHARY\r\nMACAULAY exerted as wide an influence in marshaling public sentiment for\r\nthe victory of 1833-4, as any other person in the kingdom. His services\r\nwere not of an ostentatious kind, being confined chiefly to the\r\ncommittee room and the editorial chair. Having resided both in Africa\r\nand the West Indies, his practical acquaintance with the matters in\r\ncontroversy imparted rare value to his counsels, while his acute and\r\npowerful pen was in constant requisition, to prepare reports of\r\ncommittees, memorials to Parliament, pamphlets for general distribution,\r\nand articles for the periodical press. The self-sacrificing spirit in\r\nwhich he wore out his life in the cause received additional luster from\r\nthe rare fact that he coveted none of the glory of his good works.\r\n\r\nMr. JOSEPH STURGE deserves a high place, not only among the\r\nAbolitionists, but among the reformers of Great Britain. Having taken an\r\nactive part in preparing public opinion for negro emancipation, he\r\nrecorded his protest against the apprenticeship. When contradictory\r\nstatements as to its operation were confusing the English mind, he\r\ndetermined to investigate the matter for himself. Accordingly, in 1836\r\nand 1837 he made a tour of the West Indies. Satisfied of the pernicious\r\ncharacter of the scheme, he wrote home, advising an earnest movement for\r\nits abolition. On his return, he published the results of his\r\nobservations--the demand for repeal reverberated through the British\r\nIsles--the days of the apprenticeship were numbered. To him, more than\r\nto any other man, this consummation is attributable. Soon afterward, he\r\nconceived the plan of a General Convention to promote the universal\r\nabolition of slavery and the slave trade. The result was, \"the World's\r\nConvention\" of 1840, composed of delegates from many nations and both\r\nhemispheres, over whose deliberations the patriot Clarkson presided, and\r\nwhich contributed to the overthrow of East Indian slavery, and gave an\r\nimpulse to the cause throughout the world.\r\n\r\nMr. Sturge has been an assiduous laborer in other fields of reform.\r\nAmong the first to embark in the movement for the total repeal of the\r\ncorn laws, he participated in it till victory crowned the exertions of\r\nits friends. During this controversy, he became thoroughly convinced\r\nthat a more radical and comprehensive reform was requisite to break up\r\nthe system of class legislation, which bore so heavily on the working\r\nmasses of the country. The Chartist enterprise had arrested his\r\nattention and enlisted his sympathies from its beginning. A firm\r\nbeliever in the second, if not the first line of Mackay--\r\n\r\n  \"Cannon balls may aid the Truth,\r\n  But Thought's a weapon stronger\"--\r\n\r\nhe could not countenance the violent measures of some leading Chartists,\r\nand would fain infuse into their counsels a more pacific spirit.\r\nAdvocating their cardinal doctrines, but wishing to base his opinions on\r\nactual observation and experiment, he visited the United States in 1841,\r\nto inquire into the working of universal suffrage, voting by ballot,\r\nequal representation, and frequent elections. Returning to England, he\r\npublished the results of his investigations, which had convinced him of\r\nthe practicability of applying the main features of our Congressional\r\nsystem of representation and election to the House of Commons. At a\r\nmeeting of anti-corn law deputies, held at Manchester, in November,\r\nafter the business for which they had assembled was finished, Mr. S.\r\nbrought forward the subject of \"complete suffrage.\" His lucid and\r\npractical views begat a general desire among the deputies for the\r\ncommencement of a movement for a thorough reform in Parliament. In\r\nDecember following he issued a \"Declaration,\" embracing the outlines of\r\nhis plan, which ultimately drew to his views a portion of the Chartists,\r\nwho, throwing off the old name, united with others in adopting that of\r\nComplete Suffragists.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1842, a meeting of delegates was held in London, on the\r\ncall of Mr. Sturge, cotemporaneously with an immense anti-corn law\r\nconvention, which had assembled to protest against Mr. Peel's proposed\r\nnew law. After a full discussion, in which many members of the latter\r\nconvention participated, the basis was laid for a union between the\r\nCorn-Law Repealers and the Complete Suffragists. In April following, a\r\nconference was held in Birmingham, mainly through his influence,\r\ncomposed of delegates from England, Scotland, and Ireland. The\r\nproceedings of this important body, over which Mr. Sturge presided, gave\r\nnew energy to the movement commenced at the previous meeting in London.\r\n\"_The National Complete Suffrage Union_\" was formed by this conference,\r\nand Mr. Sturge was chosen its first President. In the course of this\r\nyear a vacancy happened in the representation of Nottingham, a town\r\ncontaining some four thousand electors. Mr. Sturge was requested to\r\nstand as the Radical candidate, merely as an experiment, no one\r\nexpecting him to succeed. In his address to the electors, he avowed\r\nhimself in favor of universal suffrage, the severance of the Church from\r\nthe State, and the total repeal of the corn laws; declared he would not\r\nspend a farthing in electioneering purposes, (i. e., bribing and\r\ntreating,) nor countenance any efforts in his behalf, not sanctioned by\r\nthe precepts of morality; and urged his friends to employ only such\r\nmeasures, during the canvass, as would make defeat honorable, and add\r\nluster to victory. His opponent, Mr. Walter, the proprietor of the\r\nLondon Times, stimulated the exertions of his supporters with a purse of\r\nL15,000. At the close of the poll, Mr. Sturge lacked but seventy-four\r\nvotes of an election. He would have succeeded, but for the extensive\r\nbribery and intimidation of his opponent, who, on this account, was\r\nunseated on the reaessembling of Parliament.\r\n\r\nDuring the last six years, Mr. Sturge has devoted himself, with his\r\ncharacteristic ability, zeal, and munificence, to the promotion of\r\ngeneral education, complete suffrage, church reform, corn-law repeal,\r\nslave-trade extermination, universal peace, and cognate reforms.\r\n\r\nOn the summoning of a new Parliament, in 1847, he reluctantly consented\r\nto contest Leeds. In the course of his speech at the hustings, his\r\nproposer, the venerable Edward Baines, who had long represented the\r\ntown, said: \"I have to propose for your choice, as one of your\r\nrepresentatives in Parliament, my friend and your friend, the friend of\r\nhis country and of the human race, Joseph Sturge. With his principles\r\nyou are well acquainted. They are the principles of liberty, of\r\nhumanity, of economy, of equal rights, of freedom of trade and of\r\nthought, of voluntary education, of universal peace, and of justice to\r\nall mankind, of whatever color and of whatever clime. There are in\r\nParliament an abundance of merchants, of manufacturers, of bankers, of\r\nlawyers, of soldiers, of sailors, of ecclesiastical patrons, of peers,\r\nand of bishops; but there is a deplorable deficiency of such men as\r\nJoseph Sturge.\" In his address to the electors, Mr. Sturge gave a\r\nthorough exposition of his political views, in the face of frowning\r\nWhigs and hissing Tories, both of whom brought forward candidates, and\r\nmade him the object of their common hostility. After a hot contest, he\r\nwas barely defeated by the concentration of a part of the Tory votes\r\nupon one of the Whig candidates; but the result was a moral triumph for\r\nMr. Sturge and his cause.\r\n\r\nMr. Sturge is a member of the Society of Friends, and his beneficent\r\nlife and amiable deportment are a beautiful embodiment of the principles\r\nof that sect. Till within a few years, he was extensively engaged in the\r\ncorn trade, and has long been one of the most wealthy and influential\r\ncitizens of Birmingham. Not satisfied with devoting liberal sums and\r\nremnants of time to philanthropic objects, he withdrew from a profitable\r\nmercantile connection, that he might consecrate all his energies to the\r\nadvancement of civil and religious liberty. With no pretensions to\r\nliterary or oratorical excellence, he is able to express his clear and\r\nvigorous ideas with terseness and point, both with pen and tongue. His\r\nplans, like his mind, are eminently practical; and he goes straight to\r\nthe subject-matter, stripping off the husk, somewhat regardless of its\r\ntexture and hue, and piercing at once to the kernel. His mercantile\r\ntraining has given him business habits of the first order, making him as\r\nefficient in executing plans as he is shrewd in their formation. A\r\nlittle apt to push aside, not to say push over, obtuseness and\r\nsluggishness, yet he mingles his unostentatious activity with such\r\npurity of intention and suavity of manner, as not to offend colder and\r\nmore timid natures, while doing in a day what would occupy a month in\r\ntheir hands. Should he ever enter the House of Commons, he would be\r\nfound, not among its brilliant, but certainly among its most useful\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter it would be impossible to name all who bore a prominent\r\npart in the cause now under review. The Society of Friends alone kept an\r\narmy in the field during the war. And no soldiers did better service\r\nthan the household troops of George Fox. I may name William Allen, to\r\nwhose many virtues the Duke of Kent gave the highest evidence, by\r\nappointing him one of the guardians of his daughter Victoria--and James\r\nCropper, the munificent Liverpool merchant--and Joseph and Samuel\r\nGurney, the London bankers, the former of whom traveled over the\r\nContinent to investigate the state of its prisons, and made the tour of\r\nthe West Indies, to examine into the condition of the emancipated\r\nnegroes--and George William Alexander, who has visited France, Denmark,\r\nHolland, and Spain, to arouse them to the duty of abolishing slavery.\r\n\r\nI can only allude to Thomas Pringle, one of England's sweetest and most\r\ngraceful poets, who officiated as Secretary of the London Anti-Slavery\r\nSociety in its infancy, its vigor, and its victory--and Captain Charles\r\nStuart, one of the purest and bravest of mankind, whose voice and pen\r\nwere sacred to Freedom--and John Scoble, who twice visited the West\r\nIndies, and whose chaste oratory on the platform, and terse productions\r\nas Secretary of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society were of\r\nsignal service to the cause. Of George Thompson, whom Lord Brougham\r\npronounced one of the most eloquent men either in or out of Parliament,\r\nI shall speak at greater length, in connection with the abolition of\r\nEast Indian Slavery.\r\n\r\nI will close this chapter by briefly noticing a few of the many\r\nclergymen who rendered important services to the Anti-Slavery cause.\r\n\r\nNorth of the Tweed, was Rev. ANDREW THOMSON, D.D., of Edinburgh, a\r\nleading minister of the Kirk of Scotland. He has been dead several\r\nyears. Posthumous fame tells wondrous tales of his overpowering\r\neloquence. The reports of his speeches, which I have read, show him to\r\nhave been a son of thunder. He did not polish the angles of his\r\nsentences so much as Dr. Chalmers, but he possessed in large measure the\r\ncomprehensive views, argumentative power, and splendid imagination,\r\nwhich distinguished that great divine; while, in directness and point,\r\nand ability to arouse and sway the passions of men, he undoubtedly\r\nexcelled him. Robert Hall never said of Andrew Thomson, that he was a\r\nmassive door, always turning on its hinges, but never moving onward. A\r\nspeech of three hours length, delivered by him, in 1830, before the\r\nEdinburgh Anti-Slavery Society, in vindication of the principle of\r\nimmediate as opposed to gradual abolition, and which was widely\r\npublished, brought over the great body of Scottish Abolitionists to the\r\nnew doctrine, chiefly through its intrinsic merits, partly, no doubt,\r\nbecause of the high standing of the orator. Its influence crossed the\r\nBorder, and among its English converts was the celebrated Mr. George\r\nThompson, who soon afterward became a lecturing agent of the London\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\nThe perfect opposite of Dr. Thomson, was the eminent dissenting\r\nminister, Rev. RALPH WARDLAW, D.D., of Glasgow. His tall person is the\r\nfitting embodiment of his large mind; and his benignant countenance is\r\nthe index of the purity of his heart. No one ever attended his chapel\r\nwithout pronouncing him a model for the pulpit. One of the best readers\r\nthat ever opened the sacred Volume, his mellow voice, musical cadence,\r\nand chaste delivery, give to the precept or parable he has selected for\r\nthe exercise a force and reality that never appeared to the hearer\r\nbefore. And his sermon--how harmoniously do strength and simplicity\r\nblend, to give vigor and transparency to the argument; and how his\r\nfelicitous similes and pointed tropes illustrate and adorn it, without\r\nconfusing the reason or sending off the fancy in a chase after mere\r\nimagery.\r\n\r\nBut, though justly celebrated as a preacher and a divine, he is more\r\nwidely known for his able advocacy of Voluntaryism, in opposition to\r\nChurch Establishments, his early and steady services in behalf of negro\r\nemancipation, and his devotion to the general cause of civil and\r\nreligious liberty. Probably no chapel in Scotland has opened its doors\r\nto so many secular meetings for the improvement of the human race as\r\nhis; and usually the venerable pastor is present to give his countenance\r\nand voice to the work.\r\n\r\nWe cannot linger longer on Scottish ground; though if we did, we should\r\ncertainly be attracted by the erect form and elastic step of Rev. JOHN\r\nRITCHIE, D.D., of Edinburgh, whose Quaker-cut coat, ample white cravat,\r\njaunty hat, and dangling cluster of watch-seals, would make you assign\r\nhim now to membership in the Society of Friends, and then to membership\r\nin some sporting club, but never to his proper place, at the head of the\r\nSecession Church of Scotland. He is an old soldier in the ranks of\r\nFreedom; has fought many a hard battle with Negro Slavery and the State\r\nChurch: is an ardent free trader, universal suffragist, and, in a word,\r\na thorough radical reformer, who can instruct the reason or arouse the\r\nfeelings of an auditory with capital effect.\r\n\r\nWe will hasten to English ground, and spend a few moments with a\r\nclergyman who, in mental characteristics and oratorical peculiarities,\r\nis a cross of the thunder of Dr. Thomson, and the sunshine of Dr.\r\nWardlaw--Rev. JOHN ANGELL JAMES, of Birmingham. Of Mr. James' course in\r\nthe early stages of the anti-slavery movement, I cannot speak with\r\ncertainty. But, during the controversy growing out of the\r\napprenticeship, and in the later efforts for the overthrow of slavery\r\nand the slave trade throughout the world, the contributions of his pen\r\nand voice to the cause received additional influence from his position\r\nas one of the most conspicuous leaders of the Congregational body of\r\nGreat Britain. He has also been among the foremost of the dissenting\r\nclergy in advocating the principle of Voluntaryism, in its application\r\nto ecclesiastical affairs and the education of the people. Perhaps, at\r\nthe present time, he stands at the head of the denomination which he\r\nadorns by his talents and virtues. Mr. James has a high reputation as a\r\nwriter and preacher on both sides of the Atlantic. It was not my fortune\r\nto hear him in the pulpit, but I can bear testimony to his power over\r\naudiences on the platform. He has the external qualities, the physical\r\nembellishments, of an orator: a well-proportioned person--a voice of\r\ngreat compass, and as flexible and rich as a flute--a singularly\r\nexpressive countenance, polished manners, and a graceful gesticulation.\r\nThese are the frame and border of that grand and beautiful picture which\r\nhis strong mind and glowing imagination paint before admiring\r\nassemblies. He captivates and converts more by winning grace than\r\nconquering power; more by the charms of his rhetoric than the severity\r\nof his logic. Let it not be inferred from this that his speeches are\r\ndevoid of argument. Far from it. They abound in that ingredient, without\r\nwhich all public addresses become the mere sounding brass and tinkling\r\ncymbal of an unbridled imagination, or the sound and fury of hollow\r\ndeclamation, signifying nothing but the emptiness of the mere\r\nword-spouter. I only mean to say, that his reasoning is not sent into\r\nthe world bald, but is embellished with artistic skill, and that his\r\nspeeches bear the hearer onward to conviction in a mixed current of\r\nstrong argument, elevated sentiment, witty allusions, and happy hits.\r\nHis appeals to the nobler feelings of the supporters of the cause he is\r\nadvocating, are fully equaled by his adroitness in sweeping away the\r\nobjections its opponents have strewed in his path, leaving prostrate\r\nantagonists to admire the skill and courtesy with which the victor waved\r\nrather than hurled them to the ground. In the select social circle he is\r\nas attractive as when eliciting public plaudits on the rostrum; and\r\nthough an ecclesiastical leader, and ready to defend his religious\r\ntenets on suitable occasions, his liberal sentiments and courteous\r\nbearing toward all sects, have won him troops of friends in every\r\ndenomination and class of Christians, from Bishops in lawn to Quakers in\r\ndrab.\r\n\r\nEven an incomplete list of clergymen who bore conspicuous parts in the\r\ncontests detailed in the last chapter, would be unpardonably defective\r\nif it omitted to name Rev. JAMES HOWARD HINTON, an able Baptist\r\npreacher, and the author of a history of this country--and Rev. WILLIAM\r\nBROCK, an eloquent divine of the same denomination--and Rev. WILLIAM\r\nBEVAN, of the Congregational church, whose pamphlet on the\r\nApprenticeship did much toward terminating that system--and Rev. JOHN\r\nBURNET, of the same church, one of the keenest debaters the English\r\npulpit affords.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n     British India--Clive and Hastings--East India Company--Its\r\n     Oppressions and Extortions--Land Tax--Monopolies--Forced Labor and\r\n     Purveyance--Taxes on Idolatry--Amount of Revenue Extorted--Slavery\r\n     in India--Famine and Pestilence--The Courts--Rajah of\r\n     Sattara--Abolition of Indian Slavery--British India\r\n     Society--General Briggs--William Howitt--George Thompson as an\r\n     Orator--Lord Brougham's Opinion--Mr. Thompson's Anti-Slavery\r\n     Career--His Visit to India--His Defense of the Rajah--Advocates\r\n     Corn-Law Repeal--Is Elected to Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\nNear the close of the seventeenth century, English ships occasionally\r\nskirted the coast of Hindostan, anxious to exchange a roll of flannel or\r\na pack of cutlery for a case of muslins or a bag of spices. A surgeon\r\nfrom one of these vessels was called to attend upon the daughter of the\r\nreigning Prince, and succeeded in curing her of a dangerous disease.\r\nBeing asked what reward he would have for his services, he refused to\r\nreceive any gift for himself, but solicited commercial privileges for\r\nhis countrymen. They were granted; and English trading factories were\r\nestablished at Madras and Calcutta. These purely trading posts became\r\nthe germs of a power which, shooting out its gigantic branches,\r\nultimately spread over the largest and most fertile portion of the\r\npeninsula of Hindostan. Robert Clive, a clerk in the Madras factory,\r\nlaid the foundation of British empire in India. Warren Hastings, a clerk\r\nin the factory at Calcutta, erected upon this foundation a towering\r\nsuperstructure, whose blighting shadow now covers a million square miles\r\nof territory, inspiring awe in the breasts of a hundred millions of\r\npeople. The dominion of Britain over this immense area and population is\r\njustifiable neither by the mode in which it was obtained, nor the manner\r\nin which it has been exercised. Obtained by force, fraud, and cunning,\r\nit has been exercised in a spirit of avarice which might tingle the\r\ncheek of a Shylock with shame, and of oppression which gives verity to\r\nthe fabulous tales of Oriental despotisms in the olden time.\r\n\r\nThe whole of Anglo-India is ruled primarily by the Government of Great\r\nBritain, but a large portion of it is governed practically by the\r\nEnglish East India Company. These sovereigns in Leadenhall street\r\nexecute their mandates through a small body of Directors, who\r\nacknowledge a slight allegiance to a Board of Control in Downing street.\r\nThey derive their authority from the Charter of the British Crown, and\r\nrule India by permission of the British people. The fundamental\r\nprinciple of their government is, to make India subservient to their\r\npecuniary interests, regardless of its own. Proceeding on the plan of\r\nrealizing as large a profit as possible on the capital invested, they\r\nhave taxed the land to the utmost limits of its capacity to pay, making\r\nevery successive province as it fell into their hands a pretext and a\r\nfield for higher exactions, and boasting that they have raised the\r\namount of revenue beyond what native rulers were able to extort. They\r\nhave monopolized every branch of trade that could be made productive,\r\nemploying in the prosecution the smallest number of laborers, at the\r\nlowest rate of wages. The instructions of the Company to their Indian\r\nagents have been to make as large remittances as possible. This done,\r\nlittle concern has been felt as to the means employed by the thousand or\r\ntwelve hundred Englishmen sent thither to enrich their employers and\r\namass private fortunes by plundering the country. The periodical\r\ninvasion of these hordes of needy adventurers has been like the march of\r\nthe locusts of Egypt--before them was fertility and beauty; behind them\r\nwas barrenness and desolation. For the Company to listen to the\r\ncomplaints of the natives, was a sickly sentimentality unbecoming a\r\ngreat mercantile association; to demand inquiry, was an impertinence; to\r\nredress grievances, no part of the obligations imposed by the charter.\r\nThe Hon. F. J. Shore, who spent fifteen years in India, part of the time\r\nas a judge of one of the higher courts, says: \"The British Indian\r\nGovernment has been practically one of the most extortionate and\r\noppressive that ever existed in India; one under which injustice has\r\nbeen and may be committed, both by the authorities and by individuals,\r\n(provided the latter be rich,) to an almost unlimited extent, and under\r\nwhich redress for injuries is almost unattainable.\" All unprejudiced\r\nauthorities agree that Anglo-Indian rule has been worse than that of\r\neither of its predecessors, the Hindoos and Mahometans.\r\n\r\nFrom a mass of documents before me, I will select a few items in support\r\nand illustration of these general statements.\r\n\r\nThe great curse of India is the _Land Tax_. The principle on which the\r\nGovernment acts is, that it is the owner of the soil, and that the\r\noccupiers are only tenants at sufferance, though their titles can be\r\ntraced backward till lost in the haze of antiquity. While under Hindoo\r\nrule, the people paid to the Government an annual tax equal to one-sixth\r\nof the produce of the soil. The Mahometans, having partially subdued the\r\nHindoo Princes, increased the tax to one-fourth of the produce. Then\r\ncame the civilized and Christianized English. Asking as a boon the\r\npermission to erect two or three warehouses on the coast, they pursued\r\nfor many years the humble occupation of factors, dealing in silks,\r\nmuslins, rice, spices, and precious stones. Growing rich, insolent,\r\nstrong, and rapacious, they overrun the finest provinces, bribing,\r\nswindling, butchering the native Princes. Well secured in their regal\r\nseats, trading became a secondary occupation, subservient to the arts of\r\ndiplomacy and the strategy of arms. Having conquered, they resolved to\r\nplunder. They apportioned the soil among surveyors and collectors, whose\r\nduty it was to levy and collect the land tax. The cupidity of the\r\nconquerors increasing by what it fed upon, they ultimately directed the\r\ntax to be fixed at a money value, before the crops were ripe, and to be\r\nrated at the highest capacity of the soil in the most fruitful seasons.\r\nThe result is, that in the most favorable years it absorbs one-third of\r\nthe produce; in medium years, two-thirds; in years of scarcity, and in\r\nunproductive localities, the whole, and more than the whole--the\r\ndeficiency in the latter case being made up from neighboring farms or\r\ndistricts, or by selling personal property. The average of this tax is\r\nvariously estimated at from two-thirds to three-fourths of the annual\r\nproduce. The Company instructs the collectors, that \"if the crop be even\r\nless than the seed sown, the full tax shall still be demanded. If the\r\noccupier be unable to pay, the deficiency is to be made up by assessing\r\nit on the entire village or neighborhood. If these be unable to pay it,\r\nthen on an adjoining village or district--limiting, in such cases, the\r\nassessment to ten or twelve per cent. of the value of the land, lest it\r\ninjure the next year's revenue!\" The immediate consequences of this\r\nextortion are appalling. Thousands of all classes, ages, and sexes, are\r\nturned out of their homes, and wander about in nakedness and want,\r\nbegging and plundering, selling their children into slavery or giving\r\nthem to those who will feed and keep them as servants, while other\r\nthousands perish of hunger in the jungles and the highways, or are swept\r\noff by diseases incident to such squalor. In a single year, famine alone\r\nhas carried away a million of the population of a land fertilized by a\r\nthousand rivers, and fecund of vegetation under the warm blushes of a\r\ntropical sun.\r\n\r\nNext to the land tax, the most noxious fruit of British rule is a system\r\nof Government _Monopolies_, covering not merely the luxuries, but the\r\nnecessaries of life. The chief of these are in corn, rice, salt, indigo,\r\nand opium. The district washed by the mouths of the Ganges produces\r\nimmense stores of corn and rice. The sea, in the contiguous district of\r\nMadras, throws up large quantities of the most beautiful salt. But,\r\nthough the one district furnishes a surplus of what the other is\r\ndestitute of, they cannot interchange commodities without paying a\r\nmonopoly tax to the Government, which amounts to a positive prohibition.\r\nEven the owner of a plantation bordering on the ocean, whose liberal\r\nwaves line it with salt, cannot gather in the product without subjecting\r\nhimself to heavy fines and imprisonment. It is all seized by the\r\nGovernment, and doled out at such prices as to create an annual revenue\r\nof from L2,000,000 to L3,000,000. The opium monopoly is still more\r\nodious. On the finest corn-lands of Benares, Behar, and part of Bengal,\r\nthe inhabitants are compelled to grow this pernicious drug, and this\r\nalone. The poppy is planted amid curses, its produce is purchased by\r\nextortion, carried forth by violence, and sold to work the ruin of\r\nmillions. The opium being manufactured, the East India Company takes it\r\nall, giving the growers such prices as it pleases. Not long ago, while\r\nselling it at Calcutta at sixty shillings per pound, it allowed but two\r\nshillings per pound to the miserable cultivators. In 1839, it exported\r\nto China alone L2,700,926 in value; and for many years past its annual\r\nprofit from the opium monopoly has been estimated to exceed a million\r\nsterling. Other monopolies might be mentioned; but these will suffice as\r\na specimen.\r\n\r\nAnother branch of British extortion is what is termed _Forced Labor and\r\nPurveyance_. In procuring supplies for camps; cattle, sheep, and other\r\nfood for European soldiers; carriage for troops or civil functionaries;\r\nprovisions for jails and implements for convict laborers; trains of\r\nworkmen for the Government and for privileged persons--in short, in any\r\nlevy for civil or military exigencies, whether in peace or war, the most\r\ncruel exactions are practiced. Out rush the myrmidons of Government, or\r\nprivileged Europeans, and seize cattle, camels, sheep, carts, corn,\r\nfruits, and whatever is needed, and wherever found. On highways, at\r\nfairs, on farms, they seize on men, horses, and carriages, to transport\r\ntheir loads, throwing the effects of the owners into the roads; and\r\nentering shops and dwellings, they carry off what pleases their fancy,\r\ngratifies their appetites, or supplies their necessities. When one of\r\nthese military or civic cavalcades is passing over the country, it\r\nscatters terror far and wide. An eye-witness says: \"As soon as the\r\npeople perceive the _cortege_ approaching, accompanied by a police\r\nofficer, they run and hide themselves. You may see, sometimes, half a\r\nvillage scampering over the fields, pursued by one or more officers in\r\nfull hue and cry.\" As long ago as when Hastings traveled in state from\r\nCalcutta to Benares, to plunder Cheyte Sing of his treasures and his\r\nterritories, he expressed his astonishment to see the inhabitants flying\r\nat his approach, shutting up their shops, and escaping to the woods.\r\nSeventy years have scarcely modified the rigors of the conquering\r\nBriton, or abated the terrors of the subdued Indian.\r\n\r\nThe rapacity of the English rulers cannot be better exemplified than in\r\nthe fact, that while British societies have sent missionaries to convert\r\nthe natives to Christianity, and on the first Monday of every month tens\r\nof thousands in two hemispheres invoke Divine blessings on \"India's\r\ncoral strand,\" the East India Company has levied taxes on travelers who\r\nwould visit the Temple of Juggernaut or bathe in the waters of the\r\nGanges, taxing the devotee before he threw himself under the wheels of\r\nthe idol, taxing the widow before she leaped on the funeral pile of her\r\nhusband, taxing the mother before she offered her offspring to the\r\ncrocodile on the banks of the sacred river, and taxing Hindoos for\r\nbecoming Christians, and on their refusal to pay, torturing them with\r\nthumb-screws, and with standing in the burning sun, bearing heavy stones\r\non their shoulders.\r\n\r\nBy these and like means, England wrings from this wretched people an\r\nannual revenue of more than twenty millions sterling. Besides this\r\namount, there are numerous incidental drains upon the resources of the\r\ncountry, of which no account is rendered or kept, and untold sums\r\nextracted by the unlicensed extortion of individuals and squads, making\r\nthe naturally fertile and beautiful peninsula that stretches from the\r\nsnows of the Himalaya mountains to the sands of Cape Comorin, the\r\nplundering-ground of England.\r\n\r\nAnd more than this: during ten years of English boasting, immediately\r\nfollowing the abolition of slavery in her West India Colonies, that in\r\nwhatever part of the world her flag floated in dominion, there the air\r\nwas too pure to be inhaled by a slave, the chattel bondmen of British\r\nIndia were to be counted by millions, held in servitude by permission of\r\nBritish laws, which British power could have revoked at any moment by a\r\ndash of the pen.\r\n\r\nThe calamitous consequences of this long-continued system of oppression\r\nand extortion can hardly be overrated. The ancient public works have\r\nfallen into decay. Public improvement has languished. The roads,\r\nbridges, and canals, are in the most deplorable state. Education and the\r\narts are neglected. Native property-holders are ruined by taxation. The\r\nlaboring poor sink into the arms of beggary, while surrounded by\r\nforeigners who riot in plenty. The earth refuses to yield her natural\r\nincrease in return for niggardly culture. And the country has been wont\r\nto relieve itself of its redundant squalor by famines which sweep its\r\ntable lands, and by pestilences, which, having depopulated its towns,\r\ntake to themselves wings, invade distant nations, cross wide oceans, and\r\nscourge every part of the world.\r\n\r\nIn return for all these inflictions, and for a trade which crowds her\r\nports with the richest products of Asia, one would suppose that Great\r\nBritain, which boasts of its judicial and municipal institutions, might\r\ngive to India a tolerable internal government. Not so. It could hardly\r\nbe more wretched. Its internal affairs are conducted for the same ends\r\nfor which its taxes are collected--enriching and aggrandizing the\r\nrulers. Indians are excluded from every honor, dignity, and station,\r\nwhich the meanest Englishman can be induced to accept. A writer of\r\nprobity and experience informs us, that the public offices are sinks of\r\nevery species of villainy, fraud, chicane, favoritism, and injustice.\r\nThe courts are a libel on the very semblance of justice. Practically,\r\nthere is no law for the multitude. Often but a single magistrate can be\r\nfound in a district as large as the State of Connecticut. He cannot hear\r\na tenth of the causes demanding his attention. The distance, the\r\nexpenses, the hopelessness of getting a hearing, deter thousands from\r\nseeking it. Those hardy enough to attempt it, on arriving at many of\r\nthese tribunals, find them conducted, not in the Hindostanee language,\r\nwhich the suitor understands, nor in the English, which the judge\r\nspeaks, but in the Persian, which neither suitor nor judge knows a word\r\nof. Justice, or rather _judgment_, is sold to the wealthy, and denied to\r\nthe poor. If an influential native, in the pay of the Company, or an\r\nEnglishman, is prosecuted, the prosecutor may deem himself fortunate if\r\nhe and his witnesses are not seized and imprisoned by order of the\r\nCourt. If the Government prosecutes for a fine or a tax, torture is\r\nsometimes applied to extort confession and payment. Judge Shore\r\ndenounces the inferior courts as sinks of villainy. As to the Supreme\r\nCourt, sitting at Calcutta, it has been regarded with an undefined and\r\nunintelligible horror since the day when Impey, at the instigation of\r\nHastings, sentenced to death Nuncomar, the head of the Hindoo race and\r\nreligion, on a trumped-up charge of forgery--a venial offense in the\r\ncode of Indian morals.\r\n\r\nAnd this is a feeble picture of England's government of India, a picture\r\nthat all the plausible and brilliant extenuations of Macaulay, in his\r\nsketches of Clive and Hastings, do not obscure.\r\n\r\nI will give an illustration of the mode by which England has extended\r\nher territory in India.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of the holy city of Benares, on the banks of the sacred\r\nGanges, resides Purtaub Sing, an illustrious Hindoo prince, better known\r\nas the RAJAH OF SATTARA. He once sat on the throne of Sattara, but for\r\nten years has been the captive of the British Government, subsisting on\r\nits charity. He is descended from the renowned Sivajee, whose skill and\r\ncourage, in the seventeenth century, delivered the Mahrattas from the\r\nMahometan yoke of the successors of Tamerlane, and founded the mighty\r\nMahratta empire. This warlike people, so long the terror of the English\r\nin India, made their home in the fastnesses of those mountains whose\r\nblue summits watch the distant coast of Malabar, and on the rich table\r\nlands stretching eastward from their tops, and the alluvial valleys\r\nwhich slide westward from their base, into the sea of Arabia. In 1817,\r\nafter a checkered contest of thirty years, during which the cavalry of\r\nthe Mahrattas often carried dismay and havoc among the white villas\r\nsprinkled around Madras, and the rice fields clustering among the mouths\r\nof the Ganges, their empire fell before the superior military skill and\r\npolitical intrigues of the British. At that time, Purtaub Sing, a youth\r\nof eighteen, was the rightful possessor of the Mahratta throne. By\r\ntreaty with his conquerors, a small portion of the territory he had lost\r\nwas allotted to him; he was placed on the throne of Sattara, and made\r\ntributary to the Government of Bombay. The mind of the prince was\r\nliberal and acute; his habits frugal and temperate; his character humane\r\nand noble; and for twenty years his just and beneficent rule rendered\r\nhis dominions among the happiest and most flourishing in India. For his\r\nmany virtues and wise administration, the Directors of the East India\r\nCompany, in 1835, presented him a rich gift and a eulogistic vote of\r\nthanks. The neighboring Government of Bombay had long had its greedy eye\r\non this prosperous principality. Having exhausted the arts of flattery\r\nand chicane to induce the Rajah to relinquish his throne in favor of a\r\nfawning creature of its own, it fastened a quarrel upon him in respect\r\nto certain revenues arising under the treaty of 1817. He appealed to\r\nthe Board of Directors at London. They decided in his favor, and sent\r\ntheir decision to the Governor of Bombay. This was in 1835. The decision\r\nwas withheld from the Rajah, and he was kept in profound ignorance of\r\nthe result. The Governor now had recourse to the blackest crimes, to\r\nconvict him of treasonable designs against the British power in India.\r\nCharges were preferred, and he was brought to trial before Commissioners\r\nappointed to determine his case. It was in vain that he denied the\r\njurisdiction of the tribunal, and offered to submit the matter to the\r\nBoard of Directors. He was pronounced guilty by a majority of the\r\nCommissioners, on evidence since proved to have been perjured and\r\nforged. General Lodwick, the English Resident at his Court, who sat on\r\nthe Commission, denounced the testimony, as a mass of perjury and\r\nforgery. The honest soldier was removed from his post, and Colonel\r\nOvans, an unscrupulous agent of the Bombay Government, appointed in his\r\nplace. Not daring to punish the Rajah on the strength of such a trial,\r\nthe new Resident was instructed to spare no pains to entrap the unwary\r\nPrince. After two years of vexatious dispute, and fruitless efforts to\r\ninveigle him, desperate measures were employed to accomplish the\r\nrapacious purposes of the Bombay Government. The Prince was dragged from\r\nhis bed at midnight, torn from the palace of his ancestors, carried nine\r\nhundred miles across the country, and imprisoned in Benares. His estates\r\nwere confiscated, his private treasure seized, his entire territory\r\nsecured to the East India Company, and one of its creatures placed on\r\nthe vacant throne. Twelve hundred of the Rajah's subjects, with tears\r\nand lamentations, followed their Prince into exile, leaving their wealth\r\nto their persecutors, and bestowing on them their blistering curses.\r\nThis black crime was perpetrated in 1839. The principal witnesses\r\nagainst the Rajah have since confessed their guilt, disclosed the names\r\nof their suborners, and the sums paid for their villainy. In vain has\r\nthe deposed Prince appealed for justice to the authorities of the\r\nCompany, both in England and India. And this is the way that England\r\nextends her dominions in India--the England that lifts her red hands in\r\nholy horror at Texan annexation and Mexican invasion.\r\n\r\nBut it would be unjust to suppose that all Englishmen have looked with\r\nindifference, much more with approval, on the administration of Indian\r\naffairs. From the day when Edmund Burke made the old oaken arches of\r\nWestminster Hall ring with his thundering philippics against Warren\r\nHastings, whose splendid administrative qualities for a time dazzled and\r\ndrew the public eye from his gigantic crimes, down to the day when\r\nGeorge Thompson shook the India House by his lightning eloquence in\r\ndefense of the deposed Rajah of Sattara, a few jealous eyes have watched\r\nthe rulers of India. It is only within the past ten or twelve years that\r\nany considerable portion of the British people has uttered a hearty\r\nprotest against English oppression in the East, and demanded justice for\r\nits Oriental brethren. Some palliation for half a century's indifference\r\nmay be found in the profound ignorance in which the mass of the English\r\npeople were steeped in relation to their Indian empire. Till a late\r\nperiod, even men of intelligence supposed the functions of the East\r\nIndia Company were chiefly commercial, and never dreamed that it\r\nmarshaled an army in the field three times as numerous as that which\r\nconquered at Waterloo; that its agents reigned over a population\r\nseven-fold that of England, with a power and splendor equaling Roman\r\nproconsuls in the days of Caesar; that it deposed and crowned princes at\r\npleasure, giving away thrones erected by the successors of Tamerlane;\r\nthat the Great Mogul himself, reposing under the mere shadow of his\r\nancestral greatness, was in reality but the titled pensioner of a\r\nCompany, whose arms, intrigues, and extortions had scattered terror,\r\nstrife, and poverty from the pine forests of Afghanistan to the cinnamon\r\ngroves of Ceylon. But a better day has dawned for India. A people which,\r\nin the stormy times of Clive and Surajah Dowlah, of Hastings and\r\nMaharajah Nuncomar, hardly knew the locality of the island that sent out\r\ntheir oppressors, and which, in milder days, found it impossible to waft\r\ntheir complaints across 15,000 miles of ocean, now breathe their\r\npetitions in the ears of a listening Parliament, and through generous\r\nchampions make even the great court of the India House echo the\r\nutterance of their wrongs. Many improvements in Indian affairs have\r\nalready been secured. The eye of an influential party in England is\r\nfixed upon Hindostan, never to be withdrawn, till British rule ceases to\r\nvex the peninsula, or ceases wholly to exist. Tens of thousands of the\r\nbest minds in the kingdom would prefer to see that rule instantly\r\nshivered in atoms, and the army, with the cowardly plunderers that\r\nthrong in its train and hide behind its bayonets, driven in defeat and\r\ndisgrace from India, than that it should exist for a single day, except\r\nto make atonement for past offenses. And to no man is this change in\r\npublic opinion so justly attributable as to GEORGE THOMPSON.\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that a better day has dawned on British\r\nIndia. The first purple streaks of the morning were seen when Earl\r\nGrey's administration abolished the last remnants of the maritime\r\nmonopoly of the East India Company, and opened the Indian trade to the\r\nwhole commercial marine of the kingdom--an important step in a line of\r\npolicy, which, for many years, had been gradually circumscribing the\r\nancient powers and privileges of the company.[6] The full-orbed sun\r\narose when, ten years later, chattel-slavery ceased in all the vast\r\nregions stretching from the highlands whence spring the sources of the\r\nIndus and the Ganges, southward to where \"the spicy breezes blow soft\r\no'er Ceylon's isle,\" elevating millions of serfs to the condition of\r\nmen, and verifying the words of our Whittier, that\r\n\r\n  ----\"Every flap of England's flag\r\n    Proclaims that all around are free,\r\n  From farthest Ind to each blue crag\r\n    That beetles o'er the western sea.\"\r\n\r\n  [6] Since 1813 all British subjects have been permitted to trade to the\r\n  East Indies under certain restrictions, which were wholly removed in\r\n  1833-4.\r\n\r\nThis great boon, out of which the slaves of India were defrauded six\r\nyears by a political trick, in which the Duke of Wellington bore a\r\ndishonorable part, was a consequence rather than the cause of a broad\r\nand comprehensive movement among the Abolitionists of Great Britain, set\r\non foot by the benevolence of Joseph Pease, and the eloquence of George\r\nThompson, for redressing the wrongs of India. In July, 1839, \"The\r\nBritish India Society\" was formed, in the presence of a large audience,\r\nin Freemason's Hall, Lord Brougham in the chair. Soon after, auxiliary\r\nsocieties were organized in Manchester and Glasgow. Lord Brougham, and\r\nMessrs. Clarkson, O'Connell, Cobden, Bright, William Howitt, Joseph\r\nPease, Gen. Briggs, Dr. Bowring, and George Thompson, were among the\r\nofficers of these associations.\r\n\r\nThe main objects of the British India Society were declared to be, to\r\ninform the public of the history of the British acquisitions in India,\r\nand the character of the British rule therein; to make known the\r\ncondition of the natives; to introduce more extensively the cultivation\r\nof cotton, and to develop the resources of the country; to abolish\r\nslavery, and put an end to injurious monopolies; to stay the march of\r\nfamine, and quench the lust of conquest; to mitigate the land tax, and\r\nsecure for the inhabitants a practical recognition of their claims to\r\nthe soil; and to awaken in behalf of that distant people the sentiments\r\nof a genuine sympathy, and a proper sense of national responsibility in\r\nthe empire which claims to govern them.\r\n\r\nThese noble objects have been kept steadily in view during the past ten\r\nyears. The soul of the enterprise has been Mr. Thompson. He has been\r\ngreatly aided by Major General John Briggs, a generous and gallant\r\nsoldier, who spent thirty years in India, traveled over most of the\r\nPeninsula, administered the Government in several provinces, and has\r\npublished two able works on the Land Tax, and on the Cotton Trade of\r\nIndia. Mr. William Howitt, so favorably known in our country as a writer\r\nof taste and research, has given many of the best productions of his pen\r\nto the same cause. Numerous public meetings have been addressed by\r\nBrougham, O'Connell, Bowring, Thompson, Briggs, and others; valuable\r\npamphlets issued; and a great amount of startling information spread\r\nbefore the public eye. A radical change in the administration of Indian\r\naffairs is demanded by a body daily increasing in numbers and influence,\r\nwhose advocates have found their way into the Board of Directors, the\r\nCourt of Proprietors, and the Halls of Parliament.\r\n\r\nI will now speak more particularly of Mr. Thompson. At the close of his\r\nspeech on the occasion of the formation of the British India Society,\r\nLord Brougham said: \"I have always great pleasure in listening to Mr.\r\nThompson, who is the most eloquent man and the most accomplished orator\r\nwhom I know; and as I have no opportunity of hearing him where he ought\r\nto speak, inside the walls of Parliament, I am anxious never to lose an\r\nopportunity of hearing him, where alone I can hear him, in a public\r\nmeeting like the present.\" This is high eulogy, but it will not be\r\ndeemed extravagant by those who have listened to its subject in his\r\nhappiest moods.\r\n\r\nMr. T. was bred in a mercantile house in London. While a clerk, business\r\ncould not prevent the gratification of his fondness for books, nor the\r\ncultivation of his remarkable native powers of elocution. He devoured\r\nlibraries, and mingled in the debating clubs of the metropolis. In 1830,\r\nhaving read the great speech of Rev. Dr. Thomson, of Edinburgh, in favor\r\nof immediate emancipation, he embraced the doctrine, and soon after was\r\ninvited by the London Anti-Slavery Society to traverse the country, and\r\nbring its objects before the people. His addresses in Liverpool,\r\nManchester, Glasgow, and other large towns, drew throngs of hearers; and\r\nso great was their influence, that the West India body, taking the\r\nalarm, employed Mr. Peter Borthwick (afterward, like Mr. T., elected to\r\nParliament) to meet him, and present the slaveholding view of the\r\nquestion. This was the very stimulus needed to bring out all the powers\r\nof Thompson; for Borthwick was an able, ardent, and accomplished\r\nadvocate. They measured swords on many a field in the presence of\r\nthousands, their encounters often extending through several successive\r\nevenings. Most unflinchingly and right gallantly did Borthwick bear\r\nhimself in these conflicts. He was a foeman worthy of the glittering\r\nblade of his antagonist, and many a time did he feel its piercing point\r\nand excoriating edge. But the advocate of Slavery was not an equal match\r\nfor the champion of Freedom; and he could hardly have been, had their\r\nrelative positions been reversed. As it was, he was invariably\r\noverthrown. Thompson shook him from the point of his weapon, quivering\r\nand bleeding, at every crossing of swords. Many of Mr. Thompson's\r\nspeeches were reported. They are crowded with passages of power and\r\nbeauty. Master of the facts of his case; skilled in its logic; expert in\r\nthe arts of attack and defense; apt in quotations and allusions; fertile\r\nin illustrations; singularly perfect in the command of language, still\r\nhis _forte_ lay in the power of his appeals to the humanity, the sense\r\nof justice, the hatred of oppression, the innate love of liberty, of his\r\nhearers. When rapt with his theme, his frame throbbing with emotion, the\r\nperspiration dripping from his forehead and hands, his voice pealing\r\nlike a trumpet, his action as graceful and impetuous as that of a\r\nblood-horse on the course, the hearer who, for the moment, could stifle\r\nthe sentiment that Slavery was the most atrocious system under heaven,\r\nmight be trusted to sleep quietly on his knapsack in the breach, when it\r\nspouted a torrent of fire.\r\n\r\nThe next year after the passage of the West India abolition act, Mr.\r\nThompson visited this country, where he remained till driven from our\r\nshores for advocating the natural equality of man, and his inalienable\r\nright to liberty. We would not permit a foreigner to interfere with our\r\ninstitutions--it was offensive, indelicate, impertinent. Probably\r\nNicholas, the Sultan, Ferdinand, Victoria, Louis Philippe, and\r\nMetternich, thought just so when we interfered with Poland, Greece,\r\nSouth America, Ireland, France, and Germany. Not knowing the\r\nparticulars, I shall not go into the details.\r\n\r\nReturning to England, Mr. T. joined his old associates for the overthrow\r\nof the West India apprenticeship. When victory crowned their exertions,\r\nhis brilliant services, with those of the more sober but not less\r\nefficient Joseph Sturge, were specially commended by Lord Brougham in\r\none of his great speeches in the House of Peers.\r\n\r\nMr. Thompson now turned his attention to the affairs of British India.\r\nHaving formed the British India Society, and established auxiliary\r\nassociations in various parts of England, he, in 1842-3, visited India.\r\nHis fame as the advocate of the rights of the natives had preceded him.\r\nIn several parts of the country, he was greeted with long processions of\r\nrichly-caparisoned elephants and camels, with cymbals and trumpets, and\r\nthe gorgeous pomp customary in the festivities of orient climes. But he\r\nvisited India for business, and not for show. He traveled through the\r\nupper provinces, held conferences with the people, gathered a store of\r\nimportant information, and, having been personally solicited by the\r\nRajah of Sattara and the Emperor of Delhi, to present their claims\r\nbefore the British Parliament, he returned to England.\r\n\r\nOn a murky afternoon, in the dingy hall of the Court of Proprietors, in\r\nLeadenhall street, which was filled by merchants and speculators in\r\nIndia stocks, eager to pocket the spoils wrung from a people whom they\r\nhad first conquered and then plundered, a tall man, personally unknown\r\nto but few present, rose from one of the back benches, and, with a pile\r\nof dog-eared documents before him, proposed to bring the case of the\r\ndeposed Rajah of Sattara to the consideration of the Court. At this\r\nannouncement, a few members, not so dozy as the majority, turned their\r\nheads to see who this intruder could be. It was not long before he had\r\nthoroughly roused these free and easy gentlemen to a full sense of\r\nconsciousness. Mr. George Thompson (for he was the man) began to spread\r\nout the unmitigated rascality of the transactions I have detailed. He\r\nwas soon interrupted. His right to be there was questioned. But he was\r\nthe proprietor of a sufficient amount of stock to entitle him to be\r\nheard. He went on. He was called to order. He would not come, but still\r\nwent on. They proposed to take down his offensive words. He begged them\r\nto be patient, and he would soon give them something worth taking down.\r\nHe was declared impertinent. He insisted that his speech was decidedly\r\npertinent. Clamor was tried. His voice pierced the din, with the\r\ndefiance that \"he _would_ be heard.\" He was denounced as the feed agent\r\nof the Rajah. He repelled the charge in a passage of cutting power. He\r\nwas threatened. But he rode on the surges of too many mobs, in the\r\nturbulent days of the West India discussion, to be frightened at a\r\ntempest in the East India House. He still held his ground, and kept up a\r\nheavy and well-directed fire. The excitement was intense, the turmoil\r\ncontinuing till three o'clock in the morning. It was one of the\r\nstormiest sessions which had ever taken place in that stormy hall. It\r\nrevived the recollection of the days when Lord Clive, the founder of the\r\nAnglo-Indian empire, encountered Sullivan, the prince of London\r\nmerchants, and the chairman of the Company, who had tabled infamous\r\ncharges against him; or the days when Warren Hastings, laden with rupees\r\nand flushed with triumphs, measured powers with his deadly foe, Sir\r\nPhilip Francis, the author of Junius. Above the war of this tempestuous\r\nnight, the trumpet-voice of the gallant Thompson was heard, cheering on\r\nthe band that rallied to the defense of the dethroned Rajah. It was an\r\nera in the history of the Indian Court of Proprietors. Justice,\r\nhumanity, right, honor, were strange words to be echoed from arches\r\nwhich had so long looked down on fraud, cruelty, oppression, and\r\navarice. Thanks to George Thompson, these words are becoming more and\r\nmore familiar in that temple of Mammon.\r\n\r\nWhen the Corn-Law struggle was approaching its crisis, Mr. T. yielded to\r\nthe solicitations of the League to again advocate its cause before the\r\ncountry. He had been an agent of the League previous to going to India,\r\nand his peculiar eloquence contributed essentially to the rapid change\r\nof public opinion during the years 1841-2. In the last year of the\r\nCorn-Law contest, he fought shoulder to shoulder with Cobden, Villiers,\r\nBright, and Wilson, and no Free Trade chief carried over that triumphant\r\nfield a brighter blade or a stouter shield than he.\r\n\r\nAs a testimonial of their regard for his many services in the cause of\r\ncivil and religious liberty, the Lord Provost and Magistrates of\r\nEdinburgh presented him, in June, 1846, with the freedom of their\r\nvenerable city. A higher honor awaited him. At the general election in\r\n1847, Mr. Thompson was returned to the House of Commons for the Tower\r\nHamlets, by the largest majority, over a popular opponent, obtained by\r\nany member of the new House.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the reforms already mentioned, he is the advocate of\r\nUniversal Suffrage, of a dissolution of the union of Church and State,\r\nof Free Education, of Retrenchment in all departments of the Government.\r\nIn a word, he is a radical democrat.\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of his powers as an orator. His logic is not of\r\nthe firstly, secondly, thirdly sort--a didactic, pulpit sort of\r\nlogic--but a sort in which all the numerals are combined, and\r\nconfounded, and sent home with the accelerated momentum of geometrical\r\nprogression. His rhetoric is not so systematic as Campbell's, nor so\r\nstiff as Blair's, but leaps spontaneously from a fruitful mind, from an\r\nobservation of men and things active and broad, from a sympathy with the\r\ngrand in nature, and the beautiful in art. He attacks an opponent with a\r\ngeneral pell-mell of argument, fact, appeal, sarcasm, and wit, not the\r\nmore easily repelled because this onset of \"all arms\" is not arrayed\r\naccording to the precise rules of art, but comes from unexpected\r\nquarters, and in unanticipated forms. He deals seriously with the great\r\nfacts of his subject, and specially addresses himself to the higher\r\nparts of man's nature--the reason, the conscience, the affections. Yet\r\ncan he gambol in playful humor, throwing the galling arrow of sarcasm,\r\nscattering the _jet d'eau_ of wit, or with a stroke of his crayon,\r\ndrawing the ludicrous caricature, imitating to the life any peculiarity\r\nin the tone or manner of his antagonist--gliding from grave to gay, from\r\nlively to severe, with charming grace. His speeches might be set down\r\nmerely as rare specimens of elocution or declamation, but for one\r\npeculiarity. They deal largely with the facts, the details of the case\r\nin hand. He _reads up_ on every topic he discusses. His stores of facts\r\nare relieved of all dryness or repulsion in the presentation, by the\r\npanoramic style in which he marshals them before the eye, all clad in\r\nthe garb furnished forth by a rich elocution and lively fancy. Here lies\r\nhis strength; for a single apposite fact outweighs, with the mass of\r\nmen, a whole volume of abstract reasoning or florid declamation. His\r\nstory charms like a well-acted tragedy or well-written novel.\r\n\r\nIf India shall ever enjoy a Government which protects its rights and\r\npromotes its prosperity, its happy millions will pronounce no name with\r\nmore grateful accents than that of their early friend and advocate,\r\nGeorge Thompson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n     Cheap Postage--Rowland Hill--His Plan Proposed in 1837--Comparison\r\n     of the Old and New Systems--Joshua Leavitt--Money-Orders, Stamps,\r\n     and Envelopes--The Free Delivery--London District Post--Mr.\r\n     Hume--Unjust Treatment of Mr. Hill by the Government--The National\r\n     Testimonial.\r\n\r\n\r\nA sketch of recent British Reforms, even as imperfect as that I am\r\nattempting, would be defective without some notice of one of the\r\ngreatest blessings of the age--CHEAP POSTAGE. Not only Britain, but\r\nEurope and America, (for they have in some degree partaken of its\r\nbenefits,) are indebted to Mr. ROWLAND HILL for this measure of human\r\nimprovement and enjoyment. There are two aspects for contemplating this\r\nreform. The one, to go into heroics on its vast social, political,\r\ncommercial, and moral advantages; the other, to go into tables of\r\nfigures. The former may be called the poetic, the latter, the\r\nmathematical, view. I shall avoid both of these extremes.\r\n\r\nThe high rates of British postage, down to 1840, and which were adjusted\r\nmuch on the same scale as ours, were a dead weight on correspondence.\r\nFor thirty years previous to that time, the gross receipts of the\r\npost-office had remained nearly stationary. Thus, the amount of\r\ncorrespondence by mail continued about the same during a period in which\r\nthe population of the country increased fifty per cent., commerce and\r\nwealth in a nearly equal proportion, and knowledge among the masses, and\r\nthe facilities of transmission, to even a larger degree. These facts\r\narrested the attention of many minds. But the sagacious Rowland Hill\r\nprobed to causes and devised remedies. He published his scheme for\r\npostal reform in 1837. Its outlines were these. The controlling idea of\r\nthe post-office establishment should be, the convenience of the people,\r\nand not Governmental revenue. It was extortionate for the Government to\r\ntax as much for carrying a letter from London to Edinburgh, as a\r\nmerchant charged for transporting a barrel of flour. The chief labor\r\nbeing expended in making up, opening, and delivering mails, therefore\r\nthe fact, whether a letter was carried one mile or one hundred miles\r\nmade comparatively little difference in the expenditures of the\r\ndepartment. The number of pieces of which a letter was composed should\r\nnot regulate the rate of postage, but weight should control. As much\r\npostage was lost on letters which were never called for, therefore there\r\nshould be a distinction between prepaid letters and others; and in large\r\ntowns there should be a free distribution of prepaid letters, by\r\npostmen. There should be no privileged class, with permission to use the\r\npost-office free of charge. Guided by these principles, Mr. Hill\r\nrecommended a uniform rate of postage for all distances--a postage of a\r\npenny per half ounce, on letters, if prepaid, irrespective of the number\r\nof pieces, and two pence if not paid till delivered, the rate increasing\r\nas the weight advanced--a free delivery of prepaid letters in large\r\ntowns--total abolition of the franking privilege. His scheme embraced\r\ngreat improvements in other respects, such as envelopes, stamps,\r\npost-office money-orders, &c. He also insisted, that the increase in the\r\nnumber of letters under his scheme would be sufficient in a few years to\r\ncarry the net income as high as under the old system.\r\n\r\nNow, all this seems very simple and plain--so simple and plain, that\r\nthose who hourly enjoy its benefits never think of the times when it\r\nabsorbed a day's wages of a poor Irish laborer in London to send a\r\nletter to his wife in Cork, informing her that he was well, and hoped\r\nthese few lines would find her enjoying the same blessing--when a\r\ncommercial house in Liverpool paid a yearly tax to the post-office\r\nsufficient to discharge the salaries of its clerks--when an editor,\r\nhappening to be absent from the metropolis, wrote his leaders, to avoid\r\ntriple postage, on very thin folio post, with very close lines, to the\r\ngreat disgust and vexation of compositors and proof readers--when love\r\nletters and money letters were peered into by gossiping and rascally\r\npostmasters, to see whether they were double--when a manufacturer, who\r\ncould send a ream of paper a hundred miles for six pence if it went in\r\nthe coach box, must pay a shilling per sheet if it went in the coach\r\nbag--when a luckless neighbor, about to take a journey of business or\r\npleasure, must conceal his departure to the last moment, or be laden\r\nwith a portmanteau full of letters, to \"save postage\"--when--but there\r\nis no end to the absurdities, annoyances, and extortions of the old\r\nsystem. And who thanks the genius and perseverance of Rowland Hill for\r\nexposing and exploding this relic of the times of the Stuarts, and\r\nintroducing a reform worthy of the noon of steamers, railways, and\r\nelectric telegraphs? It is so simple! Columbus is almost as sure of\r\nimmortality for teaching a bevy of courtly buffoons how to make an egg\r\nstand on end, as for giving a new world to Ferdinand and Isabella. It\r\nlooked very simple--especially _after it was done_. So did the discovery\r\nof the magnetic needle and the new world. It is the capacity which\r\nconceives how simple things, which produce great results, can be _done_,\r\nthat is entitled to be called genius. He is both a genius and a\r\npractical man who can first conceive and then execute. And such a man is\r\nRowland Hill.\r\n\r\nHis pamphlet, of 1837, soon attracted the attention of the nation. The\r\nnext year, several hundred petitions in favor of his plan were presented\r\nto Parliament--a select committee was appointed to collect facts--a\r\nhundred witnesses were examined--and a report, embodying a great variety\r\nof important information, was published, filling three volumes of the\r\nParliamentary papers. After much deliberation, his scheme, having\r\nsuffered considerable mutilation, was adopted in 1839, to take effect\r\nearly in 1840. In its actual workings, though crippled by half-hearted\r\nofficials, it has exceeded the expectations of almost everybody except\r\nits sagacious originator, working out, during nine years, before\r\nmillions of eyes, the problems he solved twelve years ago in his closet.\r\n\r\nIn 1839, the last year of the old system, the letters passing through\r\nthe British post-office numbered about eighty millions. The average\r\npostage was seven pence per letter. The first year of the new system,\r\nthe number reached one hundred and seventy millions. It steadily\r\nadvanced, till, in 1848, it had risen to three hundred and fifty\r\nmillions. The gross receipts of the department in the latter year about\r\nequaled those of 1839. The net income of 1839 was about a million and a\r\nhalf sterling; that of 1848, about three-fourths of a million. The\r\nincreased expense, and consequent diminution of net revenue, under the\r\nnew system, are owing to the increase of business on old post routes,\r\nthe opening of new routes, and great improvement on both. The net\r\nrevenue increased from 1840 to 1848, a period of eight years, one-fourth\r\nof a million. Hence, it is safe to presume, that in a few years more, it\r\nwill equal that of 1839. What a demonstration have we here of the much\r\ncontroverted proposition, that a great diminution in the cost of that\r\nwhich the public needs will so increase consumption, that revenue will\r\nnot be the loser, while convenience will vastly gain? But, discard the\r\nprinciple of revenue, and make the post-office simply support itself,\r\nand England might probably in a few years reduce the rate of postage\r\none-half, while transmitting a mass of letters which would almost defy\r\nenumeration. This more than realizes the brightest visions of Mr. Hill.\r\n\r\nBut, the money view of this great reform is a paltry view. It is well\r\nsaid by Mr. Joshua Leavitt, in his admirable American pamphlet on Cheap\r\nPostage: \"The people of England expend now as much money for postage, as\r\nthey did under the old system; but the advantage is, that they get a\r\ngreat deal more service for their money, and it gives a spring to\r\nbusiness, trade, science, literature, philanthropy, social affection,\r\nand all plans of public utility.\"[7] Probably the corn laws were\r\nrepealed two years sooner, because of cheap postage.\r\n\r\n  [7] Mr. Leavitt is probably better acquainted with this subject than any\r\n  other man in America, and his valuable writings are doing much to\r\n  prepare the public sentiment to demand the full measure of this reform.\r\n\r\nNothing can exceed the convenience of the money-order, the stamp, and\r\nthe envelope branches of the system. The money-orders are drafts by one\r\npost-office upon another, for sums not exceeding L5. They are a sort of\r\npost-office bill of exchange, and are largely employed in the\r\ntransmission of small sums by mail. In 1847, the number issued in\r\nEngland alone was 810,000, amounting to L1,654,000. The department\r\ncharges a trifling commission for the order--say 3_d_ for L2. In a\r\ncountry where the brokers are Jews, and the smallest Bank of England\r\nnotes are L5, this arrangement is very beneficial to the poor. The label\r\nstamps, which prepay letters, are convenient to all classes. They are of\r\nall rates, and, being first prepared by the department, are kept on\r\nsale, not only at all the post-offices, but by shop-keepers of all\r\nsorts. They are used, not only to pay postage, but as small change.\r\nIndeed, they are used as a kind of circulating medium. The number sold\r\nin a year is counted by millions. The envelopes, stamped by the\r\ndepartment, and sold like simple stamps, are used not only to enclose\r\nletters, but by all sorts of persons and associations, for circulars,\r\nadvertisements, &c., these being printed on the inside of the envelopes\r\nafter they are stamped. The great majority of letters are prepaid,\r\nbecause of the diminution in the rate of postage. _Gentlemen_ everywhere\r\nalways pay their own postage, when writing on their own business. In\r\nEngland, they also enclose a stamp to prepay the answer. Large\r\ncommercial houses cause their address to be printed on stamped\r\nenvelopes, and then send packages of these to their correspondents, to\r\nbe used when needed.\r\n\r\nThe free delivery of prepaid letters in the large towns is astonishingly\r\nperfect. Almost a stranger among the two millions of London, I once\r\nreceived a letter at my lodgings, from a correspondent to whom my city\r\naddress was unknown, in three hours after its arrival at the\r\npost-office. The postman, when I was in London three months before, had\r\ndelivered letters to my address, and he now recollected the name and\r\nnumber. Besides the \"General Post,\" which delivers letters coming from\r\nthe country and foreign parts, there is connected with the department in\r\nLondon, a machine of curious contrivance, and great exploits, called the\r\n\"District Post.\" It covers a circle of some twelve miles, from the\r\ncenter, and delivers letters which originate and end within the circle,\r\nten times a day, at dwellings, shops, and offices. In 1848, the number\r\ndelivered by this post was nearly fifty millions. To these must be added\r\nat least a hundred and twenty millions for the General Post, making an\r\naggregate of a hundred and seventy millions of letters delivered in\r\nLondon annually, by the post-office department, a large proportion of\r\nwhich, being prepaid, are delivered free! But there is no end to those\r\nstatistics, and I leave them.[8]\r\n\r\n  [8] I have not attempted in this chapter to do more than give\r\n  _statistics_ in \"round numbers,\" nearly approximating to precision.\r\n\r\nThe committee, when presenting to Mr. Hill, in 1846, the National\r\nTestimonial, had ample grounds for pronouncing his reform \"a measure\r\nwhich has opened the blessings of a free correspondence to the teacher\r\nof religion, the man of science and literature, the merchant and trader,\r\nand the whole British nation, especially the poorest and most\r\ndefenseless portion of it--a measure which is the greatest boon\r\nconferred in modern times on all the social interests of the civilized\r\nworld.\" The veteran reformer, Joseph Hume, in a letter to Mr. Bancroft,\r\nthen our minister at St. James, dated in 1848, says: \"I am not aware of\r\nany reform, amongst the many reforms I have promoted during the last\r\nforty years, that has had, and will have, better results toward the\r\nimprovement of this country, morally, socially, and commercially.\"\r\n\r\nAnd how has the benefactor of a great and powerful nation been treated\r\nby the British Government? He has shared the general fate of useful\r\ninventors and reformers. At the outset he was ridiculed as a dreamer, an\r\nenthusiast. After a conviction of the utility of his plan had penetrated\r\nthe masses of the people, Parliament mutilated it, supplying the\r\nexscinded parts with uncongenial inventions of its own. When even thus\r\nmuch of his plan was adopted, he was permitted to have but slight\r\ninfluence in working it out in practice. He should have been appointed\r\nPostmaster General; but that station belonged, by prescription, to the\r\nnobility--to some Lord Fitztoady or Earl Muttonhead, who could hardly\r\ntell a mail bag from a handsaw. Liberal Whig though he was, the great\r\nreformer was placed, by a Whig administration, in a minor place, where\r\nhe could exert only a subordinate influence over postal affairs. And\r\nafter six years of incessant labor and anxiety, which had impaired his\r\nhealth and wasted his fortune, the Peel government turned him out,\r\nthough he entreated the Premier to allow him, at any pecuniary sacrifice\r\nto himself, to remain and aid in working out his plan. Being now\r\nembarrassed in his circumstances, a national subscription in his behalf\r\nwas started, the net proceeds of which amounted to L13,360. It was\r\npresented to him, in 1846, at a public dinner, accompanied by many\r\nhoneyed words. The reply of Mr. Hill was modest. He gave ample credit\r\nfor the aid he had received from others in carrying his plan through\r\nParliament, and specially named Messrs. Wallace and Warburton, members\r\nof the committee of 1838, Mr. Baring, the then Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer, and Lords Ashburton and Brougham. He delicately alluded to\r\nhis proscription by the Peel administration, and pointed out the\r\nimprovements necessary to give complete efficiency to his reform.\r\n\r\nThirteen thousand pounds, for devising and introducing a measure which\r\nhas carried blessings to every princely mansion and peasant cabin in\r\nthree kingdoms! Why, if Rowland Hill had patented a first class washing\r\nmachine, he could hardly have made less money out of it. Thirteen thousand\r\npounds from a people that smothered the \"Divine-Fanny-show-her-legs,\" as\r\nGeorge Thompson called her, with bouquets and bank notes. But if his\r\ncotemporaries do not requite his services, posterity will do justice to\r\nhis memory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n     Disruption of the State Church of Scotland--Its Causes--The Veto\r\n     Act of the Assembly of 1834--Mr. Young Presented to the Church of\r\n     Auchterarder--Is Vetoed by the Communicants and Rejected by the\r\n     Presbytery--Resort to the Civil Courts--The Decision--Intrusionists\r\n     and Non-Intrusionists--The Final Secession of 1843--The Free\r\n     Church--Dr. Chalmers--Dr. Hill.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most important ecclesiastical occurrences of our times is the\r\ndisruption of the State Church of Scotland. We see a venerable\r\nestablishment, founded in the religious affections of a great people,\r\nsustained by the arm of secular power, rent in twain, and five hundred\r\nof its ministers, possessing a moiety of its talents and piety, and\r\ndrawing in their train a proportional share of their congregations,\r\nsecede in obedience to the dictates of conscience, and, under the\r\nleadership of one of the most learned, eloquent, and celebrated divines\r\nof the age, assume the position of Voluntaries. The difficulties which\r\ncaused this result arose somewhat in this wise:\r\n\r\nIn consequence of some controversy as to the right of \"patrons\" to\r\n\"present\" pastors to churches, a majority of whose members were\r\nunwilling to receive them, Lord Moncrieff, in the General Assembly of\r\nthe Church, in May, 1834, moved a resolution declaring that the\r\ndisapproval of a majority of the male heads of families, being\r\ncommunicants, should be deemed sufficient ground for a Presbytery\r\nrejecting any person presented as a clergyman to a parish in Scotland.\r\nAfter a warm debate, it was carried, 184 to 138. It was sent down to\r\nthe Presbyteries, and, being sanctioned by a large majority of them,\r\nwas confirmed by the General Assembly of 1835. This was known as the\r\n_Veto Act_. It was intended to declare the existing law. Whether legal\r\nor not, (for on this point, when the trouble arose, lawyers and judges\r\nof course differed, and the books, as usual, furnished precedents on\r\nboth sides,) the veto had generally been acquiesced in for a long\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1834, Lord Kinnoul presented Mr. Young, a licensed\r\nprobationer, to the Church of Auchterarder. Of the heads of families,\r\nbeing communicants, 287 out of 330 protested against the admission of\r\nMr. Young to be their pastor. The Presbytery of Auchterarder, in\r\nobedience to the resolution of the Assembly of 1834, rejected him. A\r\nsuit was commenced in the civil courts, by Lord Kinnoul and Mr. Young,\r\nagainst the Presbytery. After great displays of learning and acrimony,\r\nthe Court of Session, in 1838, by a majority of 8 judges to 5, decided\r\nthat the rejection of the presentee was illegal, and that the Presbytery\r\nwas bound to take Mr. Young \"on trials.\"\r\n\r\nPresbyterian Scotland, from John O'Groat's to Gretna Green, was\r\nviolently agitated with the question. It divided into parties known as\r\nIntrusionists and Non-Intrusionists--Doctors Macfarlane, Cook, and Hill,\r\nbeing conspicuous among the former, and Doctors Chalmers, Welsh, and\r\nCandlish, among the latter. Every Presbytery was rent with discussion,\r\nwhile the debates in the venerable General Assembly were hardly less\r\nviolent than in the East India Company Court of Proprietors, when Mammon\r\nstrives with Mercy for the rule of Hindostan, or when political chiefs\r\nin the House of Commons struggle for mastery in the councils of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the Assembly having sustained the Presbytery of\r\nAuchterarder, the Presbytery appealed from the decision of the Court of\r\nSession to the House of Lords. In 1841, I believe, the Lords dismissed\r\nthe appeal--thus, in effect, affirming the judgment of the Court below,\r\nand pronouncing the Veto Act illegal. Upon this, the Court of Session\r\nmade a further order, directing the Presbytery to take Mr. Young on\r\ntrials. Whereupon, the Assembly, after a violent debate, in which the\r\nVeto was sustained by a power of Caledonian eloquence that John Knox\r\nwould have gloried to hear, resolved, by a majority of 49, that the\r\nprinciple of Non-Intrusion could not be abandoned, and that no presentee\r\nshould be forced upon a parish contrary to the will of the congregation.\r\nActing under this vote of the Assembly, the Presbytery still refused to\r\nreceive Mr. Young; and, thereupon, the Court of Session gave damages to\r\nLord Kinnoul and Mr. Young in the sum of L10,000, and prohibited the\r\nPresbytery from settling any minister over the Church of Auchterarder,\r\nthough he were to be maintained by the Non-Intrusion portion of the\r\ncongregation.\r\n\r\nMatters had now reached a point from which there seemed to be no retreat\r\nfor either party. The Non-Intrusionists, though they had prevailed in\r\nthe assembly of the saints, had altogether failed in the court of the\r\nunbelievers. In the mean time, other similar cases had arisen,\r\nespecially those of Strathbogie, Culsalmond, and Glass, where obnoxious\r\npastors, who had been obtruded upon churches, were marched into the\r\npulpits on the Sabbath, guarded by police and soldiery, and the people\r\ncompelled to receive the gospel with batons over their heads and\r\nbayonets at their hearts. These spectacles aroused the spirit that fired\r\nthe same people a century before, when, in the piquant language of\r\nSydney Smith, the persecuted Scotchman, \"with a little oatmeal for food,\r\nand a little sulphur for friction, allaying cutaneous irritation with\r\nthe one hand, and holding his Calvinistic creed in the other, ran away\r\nto his flinty hills, sung his psalm out of tune his own way, and\r\nlistened to his sermon of two hours long, amid the rough and imposing\r\nmelancholy of the tallest thistles.\" The same spirit, in 1842-3, refined\r\nby a higher civilization, and tempered by a more liberal learning, made\r\nthe same people prompt in deciding, that when the decrees of the Lord\r\nJesus Christ and the Lord Chancellor of England came in conflict, the\r\nlatter must be repudiated and the former obeyed. The interdicts of the\r\nCourts were not merely disobeyed--they were literally torn in pieces and\r\ntrampled under foot by incensed assemblies, amidst the applause of\r\nmultitudes.\r\n\r\nBut, though other instances of intrusion had arisen, that of\r\nAuchterarder was the case on which the question turned. That question,\r\nstated in its simple form, was, whether the will of the patron or the\r\nwill of the communicants should prevail, in making the presentee the\r\npastor of the parish; and whether the members of a Presbytery were\r\nliable to damages to the patron for rejecting his presentee on the veto\r\nof the people. But the points involved penetrated far deeper. They\r\ntouched not only the right of the Church of Scotland to be supreme in\r\nher ecclesiastical affairs, but they involved the whole subject of a\r\nunion of the Church with the State. They reached beyond this. They\r\nraised the question of the right of the people to be supreme in\r\nreligious affairs. They stopped not here. They leaped the boundary that\r\ndivides spiritual and civil authority, and mooted the question of the\r\nsupremacy of the popular will--the question, whether the people are the\r\nlegitimate source of all power--an inquiry which stops not in its\r\nresearches till it has explored the foundations of human government in\r\ntheir broadest aspect. Not only, then, were the rights of the\r\ncommunicants of Auchterarder, of the Presbytery of Auchterarder, of the\r\nChurch of Scotland at issue, but the decision of this case involved\r\nprinciples which might shake the minarets of the Metropolitan Cathedral,\r\nthe towers of Parliament House, the walls of the Throne Room of St.\r\nJames.\r\n\r\nLooking to the possibility of such consequences, it is no wonder that\r\nthe \"Moderates\" attempted to soothe the irritation by that dernier\r\npanacea of conservatives and cowards--a compromise. The Scotch Church\r\nquestion had already found its way into Parliament. In 1840, Lord\r\nAberdeen had introduced a bill to settle the difficulties. It slept in\r\nthe archives of the Peers till the Tories came into power. Dr. Chalmers\r\nwas now consulted by the Government. He gave his opinion as to what\r\nwould satisfy the Non-Intrusionists. He was promised a bill that would\r\njustify a Presbytery in rejecting a presentee on even the most frivolous\r\nobjection--as red hair or a black skin, for instance. But, instead of\r\nthis, a bill was introduced which did not allow the Church judicatories\r\nto reject unless on grounds satisfactory to the civil court. The\r\ntergiversation of the Government wrung from Dr. Chalmers the\r\nexclamation, that \"the morality of politicians was the morality of\r\nhorse-jockies.\"\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly of May, 1842, met. It was opened by the Lord High\r\nCommissioner of Her Majesty, with unusual pomp, blandness, and\r\nhypocrisy. All hope of reconciliation had not fled. The friends of the\r\nVeto cherished the delusion that purity and peace, that non-intrusion\r\nand non-resistance might yet walk hand in hand; and, not being prepared\r\nto break with the Government, they suffered the Assembly to adjourn\r\nwithout taking any decisive action. During the ensuing summer and\r\nautumn, Sir James Graham, the Home Secretary, endeavored to cajole the\r\nNon-Intrusionists, and succeeded in inducing 40 or 50 conservative\r\nclergymen of that party to express their approval of a settlement of the\r\nquestion on the basis of a compromise, which should give a great deal of\r\npower to the people and the Kirk, and a little more to the Court of\r\nSession. The battle was fought, on popular grounds, in the House of\r\nCommons, in the winter and spring of 1843. A deputation of Non-Intrusion\r\nclergymen was present. Remaining in London till hope had abandoned them,\r\nthey returned to Scotland, and prepared for the final disruption of the\r\nChurch. An act was subsequently passed--such an one as would have been\r\ngladly accepted in 1840--but it came too late.\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly of 1843 met on the eighteenth of May. An immense\r\nthrong crowded the floor, the galleries, the aisles of the edifice,\r\neager with expectation. The Lord High Commissioner went through the\r\nceremony of opening the Assembly, in a style of chilling pomp. Dr.\r\nWelsh, the Moderator of the last Assembly, rose, read the solemn protest\r\nof his brethren, and the disciples of John Knox quietly left their\r\nseats, and shook the dust from their feet on the threshold of the church\r\nof their fathers. When the crowd outside saw the venerable forms of\r\nChalmers, Welsh, and their followers, emerging from the ancient edifice,\r\nthey lifted their hats and bowed their heads, with bosoms too full for\r\nthe utterance of a cheer. But, as the ejected presbyters wended their\r\nway toward the high rock in the vicinity of the Castle where glittered\r\nthe spires of the New Assembly Hall, thousands of acclamations rent the\r\nair, mingled with the waving of hats and handkerchiefs, from streets,\r\nwindows, roofs, and balconies. They entered the house, followed by a\r\nthrong, in which emotions of enthusiasm and solemnity struggled for the\r\nmastery. The Assembly immediately organized, by placing its great\r\nfounder, Dr. Chalmers, in the chair. Having uttered a sublime prayer, he\r\ngave out the psalm, \"God is our refuge in distress,\" so often sung in\r\nthe bloody days, in the glens of Scotland, by the hunted Covenanters,\r\nwhen\r\n\r\n              \"Leaning on his spear,\r\n  The liart veteran heard the word of God\r\n  By Cameron thundered, or by Renwick poured\r\n  In gentle stream.\"\r\n\r\nThe Free Kirk was now launched. The crew was zealous, but untried; the\r\npilot, though skillful, was about to explore an unknown and tempestuous\r\nsea. But a voice was heard above the raging of the elements, saying,\r\n\"Peace! be still!\" The Assembly vigorously entered on the work of\r\nbringing order out of confusion, symmetry out of chaos. The five hundred\r\nclergymen who soon rallied round its altars, made noble sacrifices for\r\nconscience' sake. They had to leave the greater part of their churches,\r\ntheir glebes, their manses; many, literally, abandoning their\r\n_livings_. Their flocks followed them to their cost; for new church\r\nedifices were to be erected, and salaries to be raised, not from tithes,\r\nstipends, and ecclesiastical funds--for these had been left behind in\r\nthe Exodus--but out of the pockets of those who, for the first time,\r\nfound themselves Seceders in fact, and Voluntaries in position. They\r\nwere prepared for this. Congregations met in groves, in barns, in lofts,\r\nin halls, and heard the Word. They raised funds, and built churches.\r\nThey appealed for aid to their brethren in England and America. They\r\nsoon amassed a fund of L300,000, for the support of poor pastors and\r\nparishes. They encountered great difficulties in obtaining sites for\r\nchurches. Many of the Intrusion landlords would neither give nor sell\r\nthem building spots. They would lease or sell lands for cockpits,\r\nhorse-races, gambling-houses, dram-shops, and even for Methodist or\r\nBaptist places of worship; but they would not permit a chapel of the\r\nFree Kirk of Scotland to pollute the soil. In process of time,\r\nParliament and public opinion brought these refractory landlords to\r\ntheir senses. Excluded in a great measure from the current public\r\nnewspapers, they established journals of their own. Denounced by\r\nBlackwood, looked coldly upon by the Edinburgh, though the Westminster\r\ngave them two or three able and hearty articles, they set up the North\r\nBritish Review, which at once took rank with the first quarterlies in\r\nthe kingdom. Shut out from the theological schools of the old Kirk, they\r\nfounded a seminary of their own, placing Dr. Chalmers at its head, as\r\nprofessor of divinity. During the six years of the existence of the Free\r\nChurch, it has drawn to itself a large share of the numbers and vitality\r\nof the Presbyterian body of Scotland. The Old Kirk has a great deal of\r\nwealth, a great many churches, and a great deal of pomp. It also enjoys\r\na great deal of languor, a great deal of vacancy, and a great deal of\r\nchagrin.\r\n\r\nYet it must be confessed that this secession, so extraordinary in its\r\nimmediate results, so congenial to the liberal tendencies of the times,\r\nso far-reaching and powerful in its remote and collateral consequences,\r\nhas never excited that enthusiasm in the mass of ecclesiastical\r\nreformers in Great Britain, which might have been anticipated. The\r\nreasons given for this apathy are, that a body which had so long wielded\r\necclesiastical power over others, by virtue of State laws, ought in its\r\nturn to yield obedience to those laws--that the Seceders had held on\r\nupon their power so long as they could exert it in their own way--that,\r\nin the exercise of spiritual authority, they had been far from tolerant\r\nof Dissenters--and that, at the very moment of their egress from the\r\nKirk, they repudiated Voluntaryism as a principle, and offered incense\r\nto State-church establishments.\r\n\r\nThere was, no doubt, solid ground for some of these charges. As to the\r\ncourse of the Seceders, while members of the State Kirk, many of their\r\nacts were no doubt oppressive. The deeds of May, 1843, are broad enough\r\nto cover a multitude of such sins. As to the repudiation of\r\nVoluntaryism, while in the very act of Secession, it was a concession to\r\nthat tempting expediency which, in a crisis when principle and numbers\r\nare both important, yields some of the former to gain more of the\r\nlatter. The Free Church has outgrown this folly of its infancy, and in\r\nriper years has repudiated the repudiation. It is now, both in position\r\nand profession, a Voluntary body. Learning wisdom from experience, and\r\nacting on the maxim, alike pure and profitable, that honesty is the best\r\npolicy, long may it bless the land of Knox, Renwick, and Chalmers!\r\n\r\nTo attempt a sketch of the talents, genius, and virtues of DR. CHALMERS,\r\nwould be a work of supererogation. It is ample eulogy to say, that he\r\nwas the Moses of the Exodus, the Luther of the Reformation, I have\r\nfaintly described. The sublimity of that position dims even the splendor\r\nof those productions of his pen and tongue which have made his name\r\nfamiliar in two hemispheres. His memory lives on memorials more\r\nenduring than monumental brass or marble--the hearts of a whole people.\r\n\r\nI have somewhere seen a portrait of REV. DR. HILL, Professor of Moral\r\nPhilosophy in Glasgow University, and a leader of the Intrusion party,\r\nsketched in the General Assembly of 1840, which I transcribe from\r\nmemory, bearing witness to its faithfulness to the subject. Dr. Chalmers\r\nhad just resumed his seat, after a powerful speech, when a tall, thin\r\ngentleman, on the other side of the house, distinguished for an uncommon\r\nlength of neck and face, with a complexion inclining to sallow, and an\r\nimperturbable gravity of countenance, caught the eye. Never before had\r\nthere been seen so prodigious an extent of white neckcloth, a figure so\r\nimmovably rigid, an expression so inveterately grave. He sat so bolt\r\nupright, that the spectator was curious to know whether he ever shifted\r\nhis position or moved a feature. He rose to address the assembly. He\r\nopened his mouth, and his words came marching out, dressed in the somber\r\nhues and with the melancholy tread of a funeral procession. It was\r\nevident that great truths were for the first time to be communicated to\r\nmankind. He laid down his premises. They reminded one of the lawyer in\r\nthe farce, who, when pressed for a definition, thundered out, \"Law\r\nis--law!\" \"Judgment,\" exclaimed Rev. Dr. Hill, \"judgment is an act of\r\nthe mind.\" There was a suppressed laugh from the Non-Intrusion side of\r\nthe house. The Doctor drew himself up more stiffly, and looked across\r\nthe house in dignified astonishment, as if desirous to single out the\r\nmen who disputed first principles. \"I am in the right,\" he solemnly\r\nreiterated--\"judgment, Moderator, is an act of the mind!\" He went on\r\nwith his speech. It was a dead skeleton of logical phraseology, divested\r\nof the muscle, flesh, and blood of living argument; the speech of a man\r\nwhose father, perhaps, could argue, and who, without a particle of\r\ncausality, tried to argue too, sheerly through the exercise of filial\r\nimitation. As he spoke, a nervous torpor crept over the Assembly--the\r\nspectators began to nod--the reporters dropped their pens--the older\r\ndivines, sinking under the weight of their dinners, rested their heads\r\non the front boards--the very gas seemed to burn with a rounder and a\r\ndimmer flame--and when, after a long infliction, the last sentence of\r\nthe peroration died away in the far galleries, and the spell was broken,\r\nthere was a stretching of limbs and jaws, and a raising of hands over\r\nthe benches, and a straining to collect and concentrate scattered\r\nthoughts, till by and by the members seemed to realize that they were\r\nactually sitting in a General Assembly; whereupon, a gentleman moved an\r\nadjournment, and all retired with the conviction, that whoever might\r\ndoubt whether Dr. Hill was a profound philosopher and ecclesiastical\r\nhistorian, he possessed most astonishing _mesmeric_ qualities and\r\npowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n     The Established Church of England--Its Revenues--Its Ecclesiastical\r\n     Abuses--Its Sway over Political Parties--Rev. Dr. Phillpotts--Rev.\r\n     Dr. Pusey--Rev. Mr. Noel--Anti-State Church Movement.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Established Church of England is one of the foulest sores on the\r\nbody politic of the kingdom. I shall examine it mainly in its political\r\nbearings.\r\n\r\nThe King is the \"Supreme Head of the Church,\" and appoints, through the\r\nchapters, the bishops, besides a great number of lesser dignitaries. The\r\nbishops license and ordain the inferior clergy. The owners of estates\r\ncharged with the payment of the salaries of pastors, have the right to\r\nnominate or \"present\" them to the parishes. There are some 12,000\r\nparochial churches under the control of the Establishment. Of these the\r\ncrown presents to 952; the bishops to 1248; the deans and chapters to\r\n787; other ecclesiastical dignitaries to 1851; the Universities of\r\nOxford and Cambridge to 721; the nobility and gentry to 5096; and the\r\nresidue are disposed of by others.\r\n\r\nThe annual revenue of the whole body of the clergy is more than\r\n$42,000,000; a sum greater than is received by the Established Clergy of\r\nall the world besides. The income of the twenty-eight bishops amounts to\r\nabout $800,000. The Archbishop of Canterbury receives $75,000, and of\r\nYork $50,000. The Bishop of London $50,000, of Durham $40,000, of\r\nWinchester $35,000, and so on. Previous to the act of 1837, the income\r\nof the sees mentioned was much larger. Said the late Rowland Hill,\r\nhimself a clergyman of the Establishment, at a missionary meeting in\r\nExeter Hall, a few years ago: \"Would, my lord, that I had the bishops of\r\nthis realm tied up by the heels to that chandelier, and could direct the\r\nstewards to hold the plates under their pockets and catch the falling\r\nguineas; what a collection we should raise!\" One of the worst features\r\nof this institution is the gross inequality in the distribution of its\r\nfavors. Of its clergy, fifteen hundred receive an average annual income\r\nof about $5000 each; while another fifteen hundred (and they are the\r\nworking and valuable portion) receive only an average of about $400; and\r\nmany of these last do not get $200. Sydney Smith has aptly asked, \"Why\r\nis the Church of England nothing but a collection of beggars and\r\nbishops? the right reverend Dives in the palace, and Lazarus in orders\r\nat the gate, doctored by dogs and comforted by crumbs?\"\r\n\r\nThe revenues of the Establishment are mostly drawn from tithes. But\r\nlarge sums are realized from other sources. And in addition to these,\r\nthe clergy (whose numbers far exceed those of the parochial churches)\r\nhold all the professorships, tutorships, masterships, and fellowships,\r\nof the universities and public state schools; all the chaplainships in\r\nthe embassies, army and navy, and corporate and commercial companies;\r\nworm their way into nearly all the profitable offices in educational and\r\ncharitable institutions, as librarians, secretaries, treasurers, and\r\ntrustees; are constant waiters upon Divine Providence and the Public\r\nTreasury; standing candidates for all places of light work and heavy\r\npay; and show their zeal for the Crown and the Miter by promptly\r\nfurnishing recruits for the great army of sinecurists in the realm.[9]\r\n\r\n  [9] A commission instituted some years ago by the House of Commons, to\r\n  inquire into the abuses of charitable trusts, found a clergyman at the\r\n  head of a school, with a salary of L900 a year, and _one_ pupil. Another\r\n  received L500, had not a single scholar, and rented the school-room for\r\n  a saw-pit.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose to speak particularly of the religious character\r\nand influence of the Establishment. But, a few facts in this department\r\nmay be given to show that Paul the tent-maker, and Peter the fisherman,\r\nare not very closely copied by some of their English successors. It is a\r\nnotorious fact that a large body of the clergy do not compose their own\r\nsermons, but purchase them in manuscript at depots in London, and other\r\nlarge towns, as they do their stationery and wines. There is no very\r\nserious objection to this, provided the sermons are better than they\r\ncould write themselves. A good purchased sermon is preferable to a bad\r\nhome-made one. But, it is equally notorious that they are often written\r\nas marketable commodities by grossly irreligious men. Here is an\r\nadvertisement from a newspaper, which will serve as a specimen of its\r\nclass. \"MANUSCRIPT SERMONS. To clergymen who, from ill health, or other\r\ncauses, are prevented from composing their own sermons, the advertiser\r\noffers his services on moderate terms. Original sermons composed on any\r\ngiven texts or subjects. N. B. A specimen sent if required. Address L.\r\nS. W., Post-Office, Winchester.\"\r\n\r\nThe Church \"livings\" being property, they are, of course, marketable\r\narticles. English newspapers frequently contain advertisements offering\r\nthem for sale. In describing their desirable qualities it is often\r\nstated that \"the income is large and the duties light,\" or, that \"the\r\npresent incumbent is very aged,\" or, \"in very feeble health;\" and I have\r\nseen them represented as being in the midst of a fine sporting country,\r\nsurrounded by a most agreeable society of nobility and gentry, &c. I\r\nselect an advertisement from a number lying before me. \"ADVOWSON.\r\nPerpetual Patronage and Right of Presentation to be disposed of, subject\r\nto the life of an incumbent, now sixty-eight years old. The benefice\r\nconsists of an excellent rectory-house, lately built at a considerable\r\nexpense; abounding with conveniencies, and capitally fitted, good\r\nout-offices, pleasure-grounds, garden, &c., farm-yard, and forty acres\r\nof glebe. The tithes are commuted. Annual value upward of 600_l._ per\r\nannum, independent of surplice fees, and is well situated in a pleasant\r\nand luxuriant country, four miles from a large town, to which there is\r\nrailway conveyance.\"\r\n\r\nNow, all this simply means, that Lord John Broadacres, being hard pushed\r\nby his gambling debts, will sell to anybody, Turk or Mormon, and his\r\nheirs forever, the right to quarter a dapper young student from Oxford\r\non this parish, to occupy this comfortable and elegant house and\r\ngrounds, and collect L600 per annum out of Episcopalians, Baptists,\r\nMethodists, Independents, and Quakers, in return for reading to a\r\nhandful of people fifty or sixty sermons a year, purchased at a\r\nbook-stall in London.\r\n\r\nIt needs no \"Black Book\" to tell us, that $40,000,000, extorted annually\r\nfrom the people by such an institution, and to a large extent from those\r\nwho dissent from its ritual, and never listen to its clergy, is a\r\nprolific source of vexation and oppression, and tends powerfully to\r\ndebauch the morals and corrupt the politics of the kingdom. The\r\nEstablished Church exercises unbounded sway over the politics of the\r\ncountry, holding in vassalage great masses of the Tory and Whig parties.\r\nThe nobility and gentry find the Establishment a profitable and\r\ndignified retreat for such younger branches of their families, as are\r\ntoo dull for the learned secular professions, and too cowardly and puny\r\nfor cutting their way to promotion in the army and navy. They send to\r\nthis snug asylum their indolent and imbecile offspring, where they may\r\nreceive emoluments and pensions without burning the barrister's midnight\r\nlamp, or treading the thorny road of politics, or encountering malignant\r\nfevers while filling civic stations in tropical colonies, or braving\r\ndeath on the deck of a line-of-battle ship in the Mediterranean, or in\r\nthe spouting breach of a fortress in Hindostan. The owners of advowsons\r\nand livings, wielding a capital whose yearly income is $40,000,000, keep\r\nconstantly under pay, all over the kingdom, 16 000 clergy, who, with\r\nmany noble exceptions, are the ordained and licensed enemies of\r\npolitical progress and ecclesiastical reform.\r\n\r\nI by no means intend to say, that there are not a large number of most\r\nworthy, pious, and faithful ministers, in the English Establishment, and\r\nespecially among the poorer clergy. Nor, that its doctrines are not\r\nBiblical, and its service beautifully impressive. But, in its political\r\ntendencies, the institution stands arrayed against progress and reform.\r\n\r\nAmong the most conspicuous champions of the Established Church, and who\r\nhas recently distinguished himself as the persecutor of Rev. Mr. Shore,\r\nis DR. PHILLPOTTS, THE BISHOP OF EXETER. Entering the House of Lords,\r\nthe eye of a stranger is instantly arrested by the bench of bishops,\r\nwhose white robes and flowing wigs give them such an old-womanish\r\nappearance, that he conjectures they must be \"peeresses in their own\r\nright,\" and by some one of the convenient fictions of the common law are\r\nentitled to seats with the male barons. Sitting gravely among them, with\r\nrigid muscle, compressed lip, and knit brow, is Dr. Phillpotts, who\r\nconceals under his ample lawn an amount of intellectual acumen and power\r\nwhich are able and ready to grapple with the pamphlet of any schismatic\r\nin the diocese of Exeter, or the speech of any lord in the House of\r\nPeers. A spectator can hardly believe that those pale, icy features,\r\ncover a mental volcano. The tones of his voice give point to words that\r\npierce to the marrow of the subject under discussion, while his cool,\r\ncrafty, and dexterous style of argument shows that a trained master of\r\ndebate is on the floor. Delighting equally in exposing the fallacies of\r\nhis opponent, and placing him in a false position, his assaults are to\r\nbe shunned rather than provoked. One of the most adroit and keen\r\nlogicians in the House, he is skillful in making nice distinctions, and\r\nin setting the arguments of his adversary to devouring each other. The\r\ncold suavity with which he flays his victim, and the sweet malignity\r\nwith which he sugars over his bitterest denunciations, and the apparent\r\ncandor and sincerity which sit serenely on his visage when uttering the\r\nmost repulsive opinions, only make him the more provokingly intolerable.\r\nThis crafty prelate countenanced the Oxford Tractarians, till their open\r\nadvocacy of Popish doctrines and rites alarmed his more timid brethren,\r\nwhen he veered off in a graceful curve, and has since made haste to\r\ndivert suspicion as to his orthodoxy, by persecuting the evangelical\r\nclergymen of his diocese.\r\n\r\nSpite the efforts of the bench of bishops, a violent intestine war has\r\nbeen waged within the walls of the venerable Establishment for many\r\nyears. Two parties have sprung up, one of which would make the Church\r\nessentially Roman Catholic, while the other would make it more\r\nthoroughly Protestant and Evangelical. DR. PUSEY may be regarded as the\r\nhead of the Catholic, MR. NOEL of the Evangelical party. Both are the\r\nimmediate descendants of noble families, both possess superior\r\nattainments, are accomplished preachers, and able controversialists. The\r\nstyle of each in the pulpit is calm, logical, persuasive, and one cannot\r\nlisten to either without imbibing the conviction that he is uttering the\r\nhonest impulses of his understanding and heart. Dr. Pusey is one of the\r\nfounders of the association at Oxford which issued the celebrated\r\n\"Tracts for the Times.\" Mr. Noel has recently published a volume on \"the\r\nUnion of Church and State,\" remarkable for its research, meditative\r\ntone, and Christian spirit. It must exert a powerful influence upon the\r\nultimate overthrow of this institution. Dr. Pusey's writings have driven\r\nseveral of his disciples over to Romanism; among the most distinguished\r\nof whom was Mr. Newman; and he himself came very near accompanying his\r\nassociate. He still remains in the Establishment. Mr. Noel, having\r\nthrown his able testimonial into the bosom of the Church, has withdrawn\r\nfrom it, and united with the Baptist denomination.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the union of the Church with the State, and its influence\r\nupon the religious and political interests of the country, have been\r\nfrequent topics of discussion ever since the Commonwealth of Cromwell.\r\nThe repeal of the corporation and test acts, the emancipation of the\r\nCatholics, and the disruption of the Church of Scotland, have given\r\nincreased intensity to these discussions in our own times. The\r\npersecution of the amiable and heroic Mr. Shore, by the Bishop of\r\nExeter, the publication of Mr. Noel's work, his rigorous treatment by\r\nthe Bishop of London, the acknowledged purity of his motives, and the\r\ndignity and excellence of his character, have kindled into a flame the\r\nagitation for the separation of the Church from the State. At no period\r\nwithin a century has the anti-state-church party been as strong in\r\nEngland as now. It counts in its ranks some of the ablest debaters, and\r\nkeenest controversialists in the kingdom. Mr. Burnet leads the\r\nIndependents, Dr. Cox the Baptists, Mr. Sturge the Quakers, Dr. Wardlaw\r\nthe Scotch Congregationalists, Dr. Ritchie the Secession Church of\r\nScotland, and Dr. Candlish the Free Church of Scotland. Behind them\r\nrally the whole body of the Dissenters, the great majority of the Irish\r\nCatholics, the main strength of the radical reformers, while no\r\ninconsiderable portion of the liberal laity of the Establishment\r\nsympathizes with them. These elements will continue to increase in\r\nvolume and power, till they sever a union offensive to God and\r\noppressive to man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n     The Corn Laws--Their Character and Policy--Origin of the\r\n     Anti-Corn-Law Movement--Adam Smith--Mr. Cobden--\"Anti-Corn-Law\r\n     Parliament\"--Mr. Villier's Motion in the House of Commons in\r\n     1839--Formation of the League--Power of the Landlords--Lord John\r\n     Russell's Motion in 1841--General Election of that Year--Mr. Cobden\r\n     Returned to Parliament--Peel in Power--His Modification of the Corn\r\n     Laws--Great Activity and Steady Progress of the League during the\r\n     Years 1842, '3, '4, and '5--Session of 1846--Sir Robert Peel and\r\n     the Duke of Wellington--Repeal of the Corn Laws.\r\n\r\n\r\nA pleasant little story is told of Queen Victoria and the corn laws.\r\nDuring the second year of her sovereignty, and while yet a maiden, she\r\nwas one day skipping the rope as a relaxation from the pressure of\r\nofficial duties. Lord Melbourne, the Premier, was superintending the\r\nroyal amusement. She suddenly stopped, and, turning to him with a\r\nthoughtful look, (the cares of State no doubt clouding her brow,) said,\r\n\"My Lord, what are these corn laws, which my people are making so much\r\nnoise about?\" Said the courtly Premier, in reply, \"Please your Majesty,\r\nthey are the laws that regulate the consumption of the staff of life in\r\nyour Majesty's dominions.\" \"Indeed,\" rejoined the Queen, \"have any of\r\nthe staff officers of my Life Guards got the consumption? Poor fellows!\"\r\nHer Majesty then resumed the skipping of the rope.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some American maidens are as ignorant of what the British corn\r\nlaws were as Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\nLord Stanley came within a few hundred years of the truth, when he said\r\nthat the principle of landlord protection had existed in England for\r\neight centuries. In 1774, the corn laws received the impress which they\r\nretained till their repeal in 1846. They were revised in 1791, in 1804,\r\nin 1815, and in 1828. The revisions of 1815 and 1828 produced the system\r\nmore generally known as _the_ corn laws. The object of the system was to\r\nafford as complete a monopoly in breadstuffs to the home agriculturists\r\nas possible, and yet allow the introduction of foreign grain whenever a\r\nbad harvest, or other causes, produced a scarcity of food. At every\r\nrevision, down to that of 1828, the duties were made more and more\r\nprotective. The price to which wheat (for instance) must rise ere it\r\ncould come in from abroad, at a nominal duty, was fixed in 1774 at\r\n48_s._ per quarter; in 1791, at 54_s._; in 1804, at 66_s._; and in 1815,\r\nat 80_s._--the quarter being 8 bushels. The liberal policy of Mr.\r\nHuskisson slightly prevailed in 1828, and the maximum price was fixed at\r\n73_s._\r\n\r\nThe system was a compromise between protection and starvation, the\r\numpire being a \"_sliding scale_\" of duties. By this scale, the duties\r\nfell as the prices rose, and rose as the prices fell. The act of 1828\r\nhad 20 or 30 degrees in its scale, three or four of which are given as\r\nillustrations. When the average price of wheat in the kingdom was 52_s._\r\nper quarter, the duty on foreign wheat was 34_s._ 8_d._ When the price\r\nreached 60_s._, the duty fell to 26_s._ 8_d._ When the price rose to\r\n70_s._, the duty sunk to 10_s._ 8_d._ When the price attained 73_s._ and\r\nupward, the duty went down to 1_s._ The price which regulated the duty\r\nwas ascertained as follows: The prices of grain (wheat, for instance) on\r\nSaturday of each week, at 150 of the principal markets in the kingdom,\r\nwere ascertained by returns to the Exchequer, and these were averaged.\r\nTo this average were added the averages of the five preceding weeks, and\r\nthen \"the general average\" of the whole six was struck, and this, on\r\neach Thursday, was proclaimed by the Government as the price for the\r\nregulation of the duty for one week. Wheat, flour, &c., from abroad,\r\nmight be stored or \"bonded,\" without paying duties, to await a favorable\r\nturn of the market, then to be entered or reexported at pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe act of 1828, after being modified in 1842, was totally repealed in\r\n1846--the totality to take effect in February, 1849. During the seven\r\nyears immediately preceding the repeal, matter sufficient to fill a\r\nthousand quarto volumes was printed in Great Britain on the Corn Laws. I\r\nshall not touch this mass, but confine myself to a notice of the\r\nmovement typified by the name of Richard Cobden.\r\n\r\nThe history of Voluntary Associations does not furnish a triumph so\r\nsignal as that achieved by the Anti-Corn-Law League. In seven years it\r\nrevolutionized the mind of the most intelligent nation of Europe, bent\r\nto its will the proudest legislative assembly in the world, prostrated\r\nan aristocracy more powerful than the oligarchies of antiquity, and\r\noverthrew a system rooted to the earth by the steady growth and\r\nfostering culture of centuries. It may not be uninteresting to trace the\r\nrise and progress of such an Association.\r\n\r\nFrom the days of Adam Smith downward, a school of political economists\r\nhave contended that free trade is the high commercial road to national\r\nwealth. This was a favorite doctrine with the brilliant _coterie_, whose\r\nopinions were reflected by the Edinburgh Review, and it mingled in the\r\ndiscussions upon \"national distress,\" with which Parliament so\r\nfrequently resounded from the breaking out of the French revolution to\r\nthe passage of the Reform bill. But the landlords proved too strong for\r\nthe schoolmen. The beginning of 1837 saw a fearful commercial collapse\r\nin England, which was aggravated by a deficient harvest in the ensuing\r\nsummer. The summer of 1838 brought in its train another deficient\r\nharvest, which plunged the country deeper into suffering and gloom. Many\r\nsagacious minds regarded the corn laws as a fruitful source of these\r\ndisasters. In September, Dr. Bowring and Colonel Thompson, two\r\ndistinguished Benthamites, started the Anti-Corn-Law crusade, by\r\nforming, in a small meeting at Manchester, an Anti-Corn-Law Association.\r\nShortly after, a large assembly of the merchants and manufacturers of\r\nthat town, in which Mr. Cobden bore a leading part, resolved to aid the\r\nAssociation with L3,000. In December, the Manchester Chamber of Commerce\r\nadopted a petition to Parliament, praying for an immediate and total\r\nrepeal of the laws. Thus encouraged, the Association convened a meeting\r\nof delegates from all parts of the kingdom, at Manchester, in January,\r\n1839. This body empowered the Association to assemble a meeting of\r\ndeputies in London at the opening of the approaching session of\r\nParliament. They met in February, and petitioned the House of Commons\r\nfor leave to present evidence at its bar in regard to the injurious\r\neffects of the corn laws, and selected Mr. Villiers to bring forward a\r\nmotion to that end. It was negatived with contempt, and the delegates\r\nseparated. A month elapsed, and they again met at Brown's Hotel, in\r\nPalace Yard--the Protectionists, in derision, giving them the name of\r\n\"The Anti-Corn-Law Parliament\"--a name which they at once adopted, and\r\nwhich they ultimately taught the landlords to fear, if not respect.\r\nTheir organ, Mr. Villiers, moved that the Commons take into\r\nconsideration the act regulating the importation of foreign corn. He\r\nspoke in defense of his motion amidst coughings and hootings, when a\r\nlarge majority of members, shouting, \"Divide! divide!\" rushed into the\r\nlobbies, silencing for the moment the demand for cheap bread. They had\r\nyet to learn the character of the men they were dealing with.\r\n\r\nOn motion of Mr. Cobden, the Palace-Yard Convention now organized \"THE\r\nNATIONAL ANTI-CORN-LAW LEAGUE,\" with a Central Council, to be located at\r\nManchester. In that hour, the landlords of Great Britain insolently\r\nboasted of their ability to cope with all the other property-holders of\r\nthe kingdom combined. There was cause for their boasting. Their\r\npossessions were vast, their union was perfect, their power hitherto\r\nirresistible. During a period of fifty-five years, the number of\r\nland-owners in the realm had fearfully diminished. In 1774, when Mr.\r\nBurke's corn law was enacted, the estimated number was 240,000 in\r\nEngland proper. In 1839, 40,000[10] persons, acting together, with the\r\nunity and efficiency of a close corporation, owned the agricultural soil\r\nof England. With this monopoly, the League joined issue. Richard Cobden,\r\nin the name of Free Trade, threw his gauntlet in the face of Protection,\r\nand challenged the feudalists to trial by battle before the people of\r\nthe three kingdoms. The struggle was one of the severest, the victory\r\none of the completest, of the present century.\r\n\r\n  [10] Our lamented countryman, Mr. Colman, estimated the number at\r\n  30,000. I think the text is quite low enough. And an enterprise is now\r\n  started for the purchase of small freeholds by landless men, which, if\r\n  vigorously prosecuted, will do much to break up the land-monopoly of\r\n  England.\r\n\r\nThe leading principles maintained by the League were, that the corn laws\r\nwere not beneficial to the whole body of agriculturists, but only to a\r\nprivileged few; that they depressed other branches of industry; caused\r\nfrequent and ruinous fluctuations in the market value of breadstuffs,\r\ngreatly enhanced the price at all times, and, therefore, were injurious\r\nto the community generally, and especially to the laboring poor. The\r\npromulgation of these principles excited a discussion of the broader\r\nquestion of the relative merits of Protection and Free Trade in their\r\nwidest aspects.\r\n\r\nThe League entered so vigorously into the contest, that, by the close of\r\nthe year 1839, upward of one hundred important towns had formed kindred\r\nassociations. In 1840, Manchester, which bore so conspicuous a part in\r\noriginating the movement, commenced the series of large Free-Trade\r\nmeetings, which made that town so famous in the corn-law struggle. In\r\nJanuary, a public dinner was spread for the friends of the League, under\r\na huge pavilion, at which 4,000 persons sat down. The next day, 5,000\r\noperatives were feasted. In February, at the opening of the Royal\r\nParliament, the \"Anti-Corn Law Parliament\" met in London. Mr. Villiers\r\nrenewed the motion of the previous year, and was defeated. In March, the\r\nPalace-Yard Parliament again assembled; Mr. Villiers again brought\r\nforward his motion, and was again defeated. The delegates returned home\r\nto arouse their constituents. The cry for \"cheap bread\" reverberated\r\nthrough the summer from Pentland Frith to Eddystone Light--from the\r\nGiant's Causeway to the Cove of Cork. Palace Yard again swarmed with\r\ndelegates in November, and the persevering Villiers again moved, spoke,\r\nand was defeated. But the warm agitations of the League were gradually\r\nripening public opinion. Whigism was tottering to its fall. It cast\r\nabout for a crutch. Early in the session of 1841, Lord John Russell,\r\nforeseeing the necessity of a dissolution of Parliament or a dissolution\r\nof the Ministry, resolved on the former; and, wishing for \"a cry\" with\r\nwhich to rally the country, gave notice of his motion for the\r\nabandonment of the sliding scale, and for a fixed duty of 8_s._ per\r\nquarter on imported wheat. He made an able speech, closed the doors of\r\nSt. Stephen's, and opened the campaign for a new House of Commons.\r\n\r\nThe Tories swept the kingdom, the Whigs falling between the \"totality\"\r\nof the Leaguers and the \"finality\" of the Protectionists. Lord John\r\nfaced the New Parliament, his motion was defeated, and Sir Robert Peel,\r\nafter an exclusion of eleven years, returned to power. But, though the\r\nlandlords gave the Queen a sliding-scale House of Commons, the\r\noperatives of Stockport gave the People \"a fixed fact\" in the person of\r\nRichard Cobden. And now, said the feudalists, Cobden will find his\r\nlevel. He may sway a turbulent mob of unwashed Manchester artisans, but\r\nhe will not dare to brave the starred and gartered aristocracy of\r\nEngland. Little did they dream, in this hour of their exultation, that\r\nin four years and a half the Manchester calico-printer would convert the\r\nPremier to his views, who, carrying over half the Tories to the League,\r\nwould give victory to its standard, generously saying, as he retired\r\nwith grace and dignity from the field, \"Not to the Tory party nor to the\r\nWhig party, not to myself nor to the noble Lord at the head of the\r\nOpposition, is this change to be attributed; but the People of this\r\ncountry are indebted for this great measure of relief to the rare\r\ncombination of elements which center in the mind and heart of Richard\r\nCobden.\"\r\n\r\nTo return from this digression. The session of 1842 was opened at a\r\nperiod of unexampled distress in the manufacturing districts. Sir Robert\r\nPeel proposed a modification of the corn laws, which considerably\r\nreduced the duties. Mr. Villiers met the Government with a motion that\r\nthe laws ought immediately to cease and determine. During the debate,\r\nSir Robert announced that he would not pledge himself to a permanent\r\nmaintenance of the sliding scale, and he distinctly abandoned the\r\nprinciple of protection as mere protection. This foreshadowed the events\r\nof 1846. Cobden's lucid speeches in defense of the motion won him a high\r\nplace in the House. Villiers was defeated by a large majority, and the\r\nGovernment measure adopted.\r\n\r\nNear the close of the year, the League proposed to raise L50,000, and\r\ndeputed Messrs. Cobden, Bright, Col. Thompson, and others, to traverse\r\nthe country and address the people. The great Free-Trade Hall was built\r\nat Manchester, and at its consecration, in January, 1843, it was\r\nannounced that L44,000 had been raised. An attack was next made on\r\nLondon. After filling first the Crown and Anchor, and then Freemasons'\r\nHall, the League was invited by Mr. Macready to occupy Drury-Lane\r\nTheater. Night after night, that spacious building was more densely\r\npacked, and rung with louder cheers, than in the days when Edmund Kean\r\nburst upon the metropolis, and carried it with a whirlwind of\r\nexcitement, Thus far, the meetings of the League had been held in towns\r\nand cities. Mr. Cobden now challenged the Monopolists to meet the Free\r\nTraders on their chosen ground. He attended open meetings of\r\nagriculturists in thirty-two counties, encountered the advocates of\r\nprotection, and with the aid of his associates, defeated them on a show\r\nof hands in every case but one.\r\n\r\nThe year 1844 was opened with a proposal to raise L100,000, and to\r\ndistribute ten millions of anti-corn-law tracts. Free Trade Hall gave a\r\nlead to the country, by subscribing L20,000 at a single meeting. In\r\nMarch, Mr. Cobden attacked the landlords in their farmyards. He moved\r\nthe Commons for a committee to inquire into the effects of protective\r\nduties upon tenant farmers and agricultural laborers. His speech on that\r\noccasion, one of the ablest he ever delivered, gave a new aspect to the\r\ncontroversy, and a fresh impulse to the national intellect. And more\r\nthan all, as was afterward acknowledged, that speech sunk into the soul\r\nof Sir Robert Peel, and prepared the _finale_ of the corn laws. During\r\nthe session, Sir Robert carried through a bill reducing the duties on\r\nseveral important articles; but he did not touch corn. The \"pressure\r\nfrom without\" was becoming, month by month, more difficult to be\r\nresisted. As fast as vacancies in Parliament occurred, they were filled\r\nby the candidates of the League. Early in 1845, Sir Robert proposed\r\nsweeping financial reforms, repealing the duties on four hundred and\r\nfifty articles, reducing the duty on the important article of sugar, and\r\notherwise modifying the tariff. The corn laws still remained inviolate,\r\nbut the landlords began to be alarmed. The panic was not diminished when\r\nthe League placed its choicest orators on the stage of Covent Garden.\r\nFor weeks, that theater was crowded from pit to dome, with audiences\r\nmore earnest and enthusiastic than the muse of Shakspeare or the wit of\r\nSheridan could command. Distinguished Parliamentarians, and even Earls\r\nand Barons, were swept into the throng, and mingled their voices in the\r\nchorus for \"cheap bread,\" with Cobden, Bright, Fox, and Thompson. The\r\nladies crowned the _fete_ by opening a splendid Free-Trade bazaar in\r\nthe theater, crowding its doors for three weeks with wealth and beauty,\r\nand adding L15,000 to the treasury of the League. Ere the autumnal\r\nmonths had passed away, it became evident that Sir Robert Peel's\r\nGovernment must soon grant repeal or yield the ghost. A new election was\r\nanticipated. \"Registration\" almost silenced the shout for \"Repeal.\"\r\nEffective measures were taken to place the name of every Free-Trade\r\nvoter on the lists. The close of the year 1845 saw the League busy in\r\nraising a fund of L250,000, and marshalling one hundred thousand new\r\nelectors for the contest.\r\n\r\nThe session of 1846 opened. The result is known. Sir Robert Peel and the\r\nDuke of Wellington--the same men who, seventeen years before,\r\nemancipated the Catholics--repealed the corn laws. There could be no\r\nhigher evidence of the ability and tact of Sir Robert, than that on both\r\nthese memorable occasions he won the support of the most inflexible of\r\nmen, without whose aid neither of those measures could have passed the\r\nHouse of Peers. Such acts pour a flood of redeeming sunshine upon the\r\ncharacters of both these men.\r\n\r\nThe corn laws are dead. The principle of protection has received its\r\ndeath-blow in England. By mingling the question of corn-law repeal with\r\nthat of protection generally, the discussions of seven years carried the\r\nmind of Britain forward a quarter of a century in the direction of Free\r\nTrade in all its departments. Nobody hopes for a permanent revival of\r\nthe old order of things, except two or three superannuated ladies in the\r\nHouse of Peers, and half a dozen young Hotspurs in the House of Commons.\r\nIf the good effected by this great measure has not realized all the\r\npromises of its advocates, it has falsified most of the evil predicted\r\nby its opponents--being but another proof that public sagacity, warned\r\nby the preliminary agitation, foresees changes in existing systems, and\r\ngradually prepares to meet them, so that their actual advent heralds\r\nneither all the blessings anticipated by their friends, nor all the\r\ndisasters prophesied by their enemies.[11]\r\n\r\n  [11] It is undoubtedly true that this corn-law contest had its origin in\r\n  the conflicting interests of two classes of monopolists, the\r\n  manufacturers and the landlords. But, the turn which the conflict\r\n  finally took made it a battle between Free Trade and Protection, and the\r\n  victory redounded to the advantage of the former. The monopoly of the\r\n  manufacturers will no doubt be overthrown in its turn. A great maritime\r\n  monopoly has already shared the fate of the landlord monopoly in the\r\n  recent repeal of the Navigation Laws.\r\n\r\nA more particular notice of Mr. Cobden, and some other anti-corn-law\r\nadvocates, will be given in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n     Notice of Corn-Law Repealers--Mr. Cobden--Mr. Bright--Colonel\r\n     Thompson--Mr. Villiers--Dr. Bowring--William J. Fox--Ebenezer\r\n     Elliott--James Montgomery--Mr. Paulton--George Wilson--The Last\r\n     Meeting of the League.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe seasonable organization, steady progress, and signal triumph of The\r\nNational Anti-Corn-Law League are attributable in a very large degree to\r\nthe sagacity, ability, and courage of RICHARD COBDEN. The early career\r\nof one who so suddenly acquired a European reputation is not so familiar\r\nas to render uninteresting a few incidents of that part of his life.\r\n\r\nThe leader of the Commercial Revolution of England is the son of a poor\r\nyeoman of Sussex. Commencing active life as a clerk in a London\r\ncounting-house, he afterward removed to Manchester, where he became the\r\ntraveling agent of a house largely engaged in the cotton trade. His\r\nintelligence, industry, and sound judgment won him the confidence of his\r\nemployers, and the respect of all with whom he had intercourse. His rise\r\nwas rapid, and we soon find him associated with an elder brother in a\r\nmanufacturing enterprise of his own. He was highly successful. He\r\nstudied public taste then as shrewdly as he afterward studied public\r\nopinion. An anecdote will illustrate this. In 1837, a gentleman visited\r\nMr. Cobden's warehouse in Manchester, where he was shown some printed\r\nmuslins of a peculiarly beautiful pattern, which Mr. C. was just sending\r\ninto the market. A few days afterward, this gentleman was walking in\r\nthe vicinity of Goodwood, and met some ladies of the family of the Duke\r\nof Richmond wearing these identical prints; and shortly after, while\r\nstrolling through Windsor Park, he saw the young Queen going down the\r\nslopes sporting a new dress of the same pattern. Of course, this set all\r\nthe ladies of the kingdom in a rage after \"Cobden's prints,\" which\r\nimmediately became as celebrated in the market as did Cobden's speeches\r\na few years afterward.\r\n\r\nBut Cobden was never a mere calico-printer. In his manufacturing days,\r\nhis capacious mind embraced large views of finance and trade. In 1835,\r\nhe published, under the signature of \"A Manchester Manufacturer,\" an\r\nable pamphlet on \"England, Ireland, and America,\" and, soon after,\r\nanother on \"Russia,\" in which he advocated a repeal of the corn laws,\r\nfree trade, peace, and non-intervention in the politics of other\r\nnations; strongly urging that England's true policy was to abolish the\r\nagricultural monopoly, open her ports to the world, stick to trade and\r\nmanufactures, and not meddle with foreign controversies. The information\r\nwhich these pamphlets displayed was rare and valuable; the reasonings\r\ncogent; the style forcible; and the sentiments eulogistic of \"those free\r\ninstitutions which are favorable to the peace, wealth, education, and\r\nhappiness of mankind.\" As an illustration of his thorough mode of\r\nsifting a question, it may be stated that, before writing his pamphlet\r\non Russia, he made a tour to the East expressly to gain information on\r\nthat subject.\r\n\r\nMr. Cobden had now secured a reputation in Manchester and the\r\nsurrounding district, and became a leading man in all public movements,\r\nespecially such as related to business and trade. In 1837, he was\r\ninvited to contest Stockport for a seat in Parliament. He failed of an\r\nelection by fifty-five votes. In 1840, he was requested to stand for\r\nManchester; but he declined, because he was expected to support, in all\r\nthings, the Whig Administration; and, being far in advance of it on the\r\nsubject of Free Trade, he was not the man to put on a chain to win a\r\nseat on the Treasury benches of the House of Commons. He was returned\r\nfor Stockport at the general election the next year, and his biography\r\nhas since become a part of English history. Of his services in the cause\r\nof Free Trade, I have already spoken at some length.\r\n\r\nOn the second of July, 1846, the act repealing the Corn Laws having\r\nreceived the royal assent, the League held its final meeting at\r\nManchester. All the _elite_ of that victorious body had assembled from\r\nthree kingdoms. George Wilson, who had presided as chairman of the\r\ncouncil during the entire struggle, called to order. Having given a\r\nrapid sketch of the rise, progress, and triumph of the Association, he\r\nrequested Mr. Cobden to address the Assembly. As he rose, the multitude\r\nsprang to its feet as one man, and greeted him with cheer on cheer,\r\ncheer on cheer, cheer on cheer. There stood the brave leader, the modest\r\nman, the victor in a field more glorious than ever Wellington won,\r\nunable to utter a word for several minutes, for the rapturous shouts of\r\nhis companions in arms. His speech was characteristic. He bestowed warm\r\neulogies upon his co-workers in the League, generously complimented Sir\r\nRobert Peel and Lord John Russell for their services in the crisis of\r\nthe conflict, and delicately alluding to his own labors, insisted, in\r\nspite of the thundering \"noes\" which greeted the statement, that far too\r\nlarge a share of credit had been bestowed on him. He closed by moving\r\nthat the operations of the League be suspended, and the Executive\r\nCouncil requested to wind up its affairs with as little delay as\r\npossible. The next day, a modest letter appeared in the public prints,\r\naddressed by him to the electors of Stockport, heartily thanking them\r\nfor the confidence and kindness with which they had honored him, and\r\nannouncing that the state of his health induced him to seek a temporary\r\nwithdrawal from public life. Then followed the European tour; the\r\nfeastings and toastings at Genoa, Paris, and other Continental cities;\r\nthe munificent National Testimonial of nearly $100,000; the reelection\r\nto Parliament; the plans for financial reform; the motion and speech on\r\nthat subject during the late session; the defeat; the girding up of the\r\narmor for another struggle.\r\n\r\nThose who associate in their fancy great physical endowments with great\r\npolitical achievements, would be disappointed in the person of Mr.\r\nCobden. His name is announced. Forward steps a pale, slender man, with\r\ngrave features stamped with few of the lineaments usually coupled with\r\ngreatness and energy, and with rather a weak voice, and a gesticulation\r\nno wise striking, begins to unfold his subject. But, lucid arrangement;\r\nwell selected words; arguments that penetrate to the marrow; facts new\r\nand old, clearly presented and felicitously applied; illustrations that\r\nshed light without bewildering; an occasional apothegmatic expression,\r\nembodying the whole subject in a phrase that enslaves the memory;\r\nearnestness and sincerity which first enlist sympathy and soon beget\r\nconviction--these are the elements of his power as a public speaker. The\r\nLeague furnished half a score of more brilliant orators than he; it\r\nproduced not another such advocate. But, effective as were his forensic\r\nabilities, these did not place him at the head of the Anti-Corn-Law\r\nmovement. He was as wise in council as he was resolute in action; and\r\nhis well-balanced mind, his sturdy common sense, made him proof against\r\nthe importunities of short-sighted coadjutors, and the snares of\r\nlong-headed antagonists. A radical without rashness, a leader without\r\narrogance, he carried straight forward to victory a constantly\r\nincreasing host, never committing a blunder, nor sustaining an\r\nunnecessary reverse during a long conflict of peculiar excitement and\r\ntemptation.\r\n\r\nNext to Mr. Cobden, in popular estimation, among the League champions,\r\nstood the enthusiastic, eloquent Quaker, JOHN BRIGHT. He entered\r\nParliament in 1843, and, like Cobden, was from the manufacturing class.\r\nFor some years, he had been distinguished among the anti-rate paying\r\ndissenters of Central and Northern England, for his vigorous support of\r\nreligious freedom. He had resisted the extortions of some persecuting\r\ndignitaries of the Establishment, and subjected them, on two or three\r\noccasions, to most mortifying defeats. He brought into Parliament a high\r\nreputation as an advocate of the League before popular assemblies, and\r\nan intimate knowledge of the subject of protection and free trade. His\r\nready, bold, inspiring style of oratory partook more of the fervor of\r\nthe platform than the calmness of the forum. But shrewdness and tact\r\nsoon enabled him to catch the key-note of the House, where he displayed\r\nskill and courage as first lieutenant of the League, and won as much\r\npopularity from the aristocratic sections as so radical a democrat could\r\nreasonably expect.\r\n\r\nColonel PERRONET THOMPSON, a liberal of the old school, was an efficient\r\nmember of the League. The incidents of his life would furnish materials\r\nfor a dozen novels. He had served and commanded, both in the navy and\r\narmy, in two hemispheres, going through storm and flame in contests with\r\nFrenchmen in the Peninsula, South Americans at Buenos Ayres,\r\nslave-traders on the coast of Africa, Arabs around the Persian Gulf, and\r\nHindoos among the sources of the Ganges. In the midst of moving\r\naccidents by flood and field, he mastered the French, Spanish, and\r\nArabic languages, wrote pamphlets on Law and Morals, read the works of\r\nJeremy Bentham, and negotiated commercial treaties, one of which is\r\nremarkable for being the first public act that declared the slave-trade\r\npiracy. Retiring on half pay in 1824, he turned his attention\r\nexclusively to politics and literature. He gave full scope to his\r\ndemocratic tendencies, and became a leader among the radicals. For ten\r\nyears he wrote many of the ablest papers on current public questions\r\nthat appeared in the Westminster Review, of which journal he was for\r\nsome time the joint editor and proprietor with Dr. Bowring. His style is\r\nremarkable for its originality and vigor, combining the pith of Lacon,\r\nthe raciness of Franklin, and the liberality of Jefferson. His speeches\r\nare distinguished for the same sententious and suggestive qualities that\r\nmark his writings. I am tempted to quote, though I spoil it by\r\nmutilation, his definition of a radical. \"What,\" asks the Colonel, \"_is_\r\na radical? One that has got the root of the matter in him. One that\r\nknows his ills, and goes to work the right way to remove them. Every man\r\nis a radical that shuts his mouth to keep out flies. Does any man go to\r\na doctor, and ask for a cure that is not radical? All men have been\r\nradicals who ever did any good since the world began. Adam was a radical\r\nwhen he cleared the first place from rubbish, for Eve to spin in. Noah\r\nwas a radical, when, hearing the world was to be drowned, he went about\r\nsuch a common-sense proceeding as making himself a ship to swim in. An\r\nantediluvian Whig would have laid half a dozen sticks together for an\r\nark, and called it a virtual representation.\" Colonel T. had high\r\nclaims--a preemption title--to the position he occupied in the corn\r\nlaw-struggle; for, twelve years before that controversy begun, he wrote\r\n\"The Catechism of the Corn Laws,\" which contained the substance of all\r\nthat was subsequently elaborated by Cobden and his coadjutors.\r\n\r\nMR. VILLIERS was the Free-Trade leader in Parliament till Cobden\r\nappeared; and, indeed, on account of his early services, he was called\r\nby courtesy the leader until the victory was won. His annual motion for\r\nrepeal was a thermometer to measure the rise of public opinion; and his\r\nannual speech, laden with facts and arguments, converted thousands\r\nbeyond the walls, if it failed to win majorities within. The\r\nmultifarious learning and diligent pen of DR. BOWRING were often in\r\nrequisition. A disciple of Bentham, an early advocate of Free Trade,\r\nacquainted with the commercial systems of foreign countries beyond most\r\nmen, with a mind ripened by study and enlarged by extensive travel, he\r\nrendered important aid throughout the controversy. WILLIAM J. FOX, a\r\nUnitarian minister in London, a refined gentleman, a classic scholar, an\r\noriginal thinker, an enlightened philanthropist, added eclat to the\r\nDrury-Lane and Covent-Garden meetings. He now represents Finsbury in\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nIn this summary, I must not omit the iron poet of Sheffield. Like the\r\nAyrshire plowman, he sprung from the working class. Like him, his songs\r\nare the lays of labor. But, unlike him, his muse did not draw her\r\ninspiration from the breath of the open fields, perfumed with daisies\r\nand adorned with hawthorn, but from the hot atmosphere of furnaces,\r\nringing with the clang of anvils and the hoarse grating of machinery.\r\nBurns was the bard of yeomen. ELLIOTT is the bard of artisans. Both have\r\ntouched the deepest chords of human feeling, and waked echoes that shall\r\nvibrate till human hearts cease to pulsate. Wandering a few years ago in\r\nthe suburbs of Sheffield, my eye fell upon a building, blackened with\r\nthe blackest smoke of that most somber town, whose front showed a sign\r\nrunning, I think, thus: \"_Elliott & Co.'s Iron and Steel Warehouse._\" I\r\ninquired of a young man, dressed in a frock, besmeared with iron and\r\ncoal, for the head of the establishment. \"My father,\" said he, \"is just\r\ngone. You will find him at his house yonder.\" I repaired thither. The\r\n\"Corn-Law Rhymer\" stood on the threshold in his stocking feet, holding a\r\npair of coarse shoes in his hand. His frank \"walk in\" assured me I was\r\nwelcome. I had just left the residence of MONTGOMERY. The transition\r\ncould hardly be greater than from James Montgomery to Ebenezer Elliott.\r\nThe former was polished in his manners, exquisitely neat in his personal\r\nappearance, and his bland conversation never rose above a calm level\r\nexcept once, when he spoke with an indignation that years had not abated\r\nof his repeated imprisonment in York Castle, for the publication, first\r\nin verse and then in prose, of liberal and humane sentiments, which\r\noffended the Government. And now I was confronted with a burly\r\niron-monger, rapid in speech, glowing with enthusiasm, putting and\r\nanswering a dozen questions at a breath, eulogizing American\r\nrepublicanism and denouncing British aristocracy, throwing sarcasms at\r\nthe Duke of Wellington, and anointing General Jackson with the oil of\r\nflattery, pouring out a flood of racy talk about Church Establishments,\r\nBiddle and the Bank, poetry, politics, the price of iron and the price\r\nof corn, while ever and anon he thrust his damp feet into the embers,\r\nand hung his wet shoes on the grate to dry. A much shorter interview\r\nthan I enjoyed would be sufficient to prove, even if their works were\r\nforgotten, that of the two Sheffield poets, Elliott's grasp of intellect\r\nwas much the stronger, his genius far the more buoyant and elastic. Yet\r\nhas the milder bard done and suffered much for civil and religious\r\nliberty. But the stronger! Not corn-law repealers only, but all Britons\r\nwho moisten their scanty bread with the sweat of the brow, are largely\r\nindebted to his inspiring lays for the mighty bound which the laboring\r\nmind of England has taken in our day. Some of his poems are among the\r\nrarest and purest gems that shine on the sacred mount. Others are as\r\nrugged, aye, and as strong, as the iron bars in his own warehouse. They\r\nbreak out in denunciations of privileged tyrants and titled\r\nextortioners, with sounds like the echoes of a Hebrew prophet. The\r\ngenius that animates and the humanity that warms every line, carry them\r\nwhere more fastidious and frigid productions would never find their way.\r\nElliott has been called harsh and vindictive. He may be pardoned for\r\nhating institutions which reduce every fourth man to beggary, while a\r\ngreat heart beats in his bosom. Against meanness and oppression, his\r\nmuse has rung out battle-songs, charged with indignation, defiance,\r\nsarcasm, and contempt; but into the ears of the lowly and wan sons of\r\ntoil, it has breathed the sweetest murmurs of sympathy, consolation, and\r\nhope. The key which unlocks his harmony he has furnished in these angry\r\nlines:\r\n\r\n  \"For thee, my country, thee, do I perform,\r\n    Sternly, the duty of a man born free,\r\n  Heedless, though ass, and wolf, and venom'd worm,\r\n    Shake ears and fangs, with brandished bray, at me.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to even name a tithe of the men of might and genius\r\nwhose public services gave energy to this conflict, and splendor to this\r\nvictory. Behind these stood a host whose less conspicuous, but not less\r\nefficient labors, gave aim to that conflict and certainty to that\r\nvictory. Only two will be mentioned--MR. PAULTON, the able editor of\r\n\"_The League_\" newspaper, who was one of the earliest actors in the\r\nenterprise, and weekly sent forth from his closet arguments which, when\r\nreiterated by eloquent tongues on the rostrum, made the land echo the\r\ncry of \"Cheap Bread;\" and MR. GEORGE WILSON, who officiated as Chairman\r\nof the League from its creation to its extinction. Some estimate may be\r\nformed of the extent of his services by a fact stated by Mr. Cobden in\r\nhis speech at the dissolution. It appeared from the official records of\r\nthe League, that, during the seven years of its existence, Mr. Wilson\r\nhad attended its meetings one thousand three hundred and sixty-one\r\ntimes, and had never received one penny for his labor. Such devotion\r\nbankrupts all eulogy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n     National Debt of Great Britain--Lavish Expenditures of the\r\n     Government--Its Enormous Taxes--Will the Debt be Repudiated?--Will\r\n     it Occasion a Revolution?--Plan of Mr. Ricardo to pay the Debt--Mr.\r\n     Hume's Efforts at Retrenchment.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat Britain is the richest and poorest nation of modern times. Her\r\nsea-sweeping commerce, her varied and vast manufactures, her fertile\r\nagriculture, the millions which flow into her coffers from her colonial\r\npossessions, are sufficient, were she free from debt, and her Government\r\neconomically administered, to make her every son and daughter\r\nprosperous. But her huge national debt, and her immense annual\r\nexpenditures, crush her laboring masses between the upper and nether\r\nmillstones of remorseless taxation and hopeless poverty. Her debt sits\r\nupon the body politic like the nightmare of Erebus, almost stopping the\r\ncirculation of the vital fluids. Like other high-born bankrupts, she is\r\nproud, as well as poor. She maintains the most lavish and expensive\r\nGovernment in the world. Though the interest of her public debt eats out\r\nthe substance of her people, and the army, the navy, and the church,\r\ncling like leeches to her monetary arteries, she annually throws away\r\nimmense sums in the shape of pensions and sinecures to worn-out heroes\r\nand civilians, to generals, admirals, ex-chancellors, judges, and\r\ndiplomatists, to decayed nobles and knights, and every kind of titled\r\nnondescript noodle and nonentity.[12] She lavishes munificent gifts on\r\ndilapidated hospitals, schools, and charitable institutions, whose sole\r\nrecipients of the bounty are the dryer branches of noble families, with\r\nlong titles and short purses, whose control over the empty\r\nestablishments is a sheer sinecure. She heaps bounties on numerous\r\nsquads of imbeciles, whose blood is of that pale, watery kind supposed\r\nto indicate royalty, spending, in a recent year, more than L100,000 upon\r\nthe nurseries, stables, and kennels of her Majesty's babies, horses, and\r\npuppies.[13] She pays large annual tribute to her universities, that\r\nthe sons of her nobility and gentry may riot on good living and bad\r\nLatin. She quarters at death's door a myriad army of starving paupers,\r\nthat her landlords may maintain monopolies in the soil, the grain, and\r\nthe game of the kingdom. Fond of fight and feathers, she hires the sons\r\nof her poor at thirteen shillings a month, to sail and march round the\r\nworld, and bully and kill all who oppose their progress, while she keeps\r\ntheir fathers at home to work out the expenses at a shilling a day. She\r\nlays open the whole kingdom as foraging grounds for a ravenous Church\r\nEstablishment, whose wardens tithe not only mint, anise, and cummin, but\r\nall \"weightier matters;\" and whose \"wolves,\" clad in broadcloth, hunt\r\nfoxes at L5,000 per year, and hire curates to look after the sheep, at\r\nL50. In a word, the pockets and patience of the larger share of British\r\nsubjects are so heavily taxed by these imposts and impositions, that\r\nloyalty itself cries out in tones of vexation and agony, \"Though kings\r\ncan do no wrong, they have a very expensive way of doing right.\"\r\n\r\n  [12] A writer in a recent number of the _London Times_, says: \"There are\r\n  various classes of pensions, but they all agree in this,--namely, that\r\n  they are for the most part undeserved, and that the recipients do\r\n  nothing for their money. There are pensions given under the pretense of\r\n  supporting the peerage, in consideration of parties' circumstances, and\r\n  to compensate for abolished sinecures. Others there are that may be\r\n  called 'mysterious pensions,' that no man knoweth the origin of. Of the\r\n  first sort, Lord Bexley's pension of 3,000_l._ is an example. This man\r\n  was found unfit for the office of Chancellor of the Exchequer some years\r\n  ago, and therefore was hoisted into the house of incurables. Lord Allen\r\n  receives a good fat pension in consideration of his pecuniary condition.\r\n  The Honorable Jane Carr receives 1000_l._, nobody knows for what. But\r\n  the pensions for abolished sinecures are the most flagrant. Thus Lord\r\n  Ellenborough receives 7700_l._ a year as compensation for the abolished\r\n  nominal office of chief clerk in the Queen's Bench!--nearly as much as\r\n  the Lord Chief Justice's salary!! There are even worse than this,\r\n  however. J. C. Beresford receives between 4000_l._ and 5000_l._ as\r\n  compensation for the abolished sinecure of storekeeper of the Customs,\r\n  Dublin! The Reverend J. Burrard receives as compensation for the\r\n  abolished sinecure of searcher of the Customs, Dublin, 1100_l._ a year!\"\r\n\r\n  [13] The writer in the _Times_ gives this \"royal\" list:--\r\n\r\n                                                                  Per ann.\r\n    The Queen eats and drinks                                      L63,000\r\n    Ditto pocket money                                              60,000\r\n    Prince Albert                                                   38,000\r\n    Queen Dowager                                                  100,000\r\n    Natural children of William IV., about                           3,000\r\n    King of Hanover                                                 21,000\r\n    Leopold, King of the Belgians                                   50,000\r\n    Prince of Mecklenburgh Strelitz                                  2,000\r\n    His wife, the Duke of Cambridge's daughter, Augusta Caroline     3,000\r\n    The Royal Dukes and Duchesses, about      100,000\r\n\r\n  The following are a few miscellaneous items:\r\n\r\n    The repairs to the Pimlico Palace, _estimated_ at              150,000\r\n    The Royal Yacht                                                 20,000\r\n    Windsor Castle has cost within the present century           3,000,000\r\n    The repairs to St. James' Palace were about                     30,000\r\n    Buckingham Palace, before the present repairs                   34,000\r\n    The Kitchen Garden at Frogmore                                  23,000\r\n    George IVth's natural children have cost the country           100,000\r\n\r\nAt the accession of William and Mary, in 1689, the national debt of\r\nGreat Britain was L664,000.

The population of the United Kingdom is 26 or 27,000,000.\r\nConsequently, the average debt of each man, woman, and child, is upwards\r\nof L30, or $150. The adult male population, with such females as are\r\nindependent property-holders, does not probably exceed 7,000,000. To\r\ndischarge the debt, it would be necessary that these persons should pay,\r\non an average, nearly $600. This debt may be repudiated; but can it\r\never be paid?\r\n\r\nLooking only to the records, the debt is owing to some 300,000 persons.\r\nIt would seem, then, that 27,000,000 of people are enormously taxed to\r\npay the interest on this vast debt to this small number of creditors.\r\nThe British Government is always laying anchors to windward. Forty years\r\nago, when this debt was rapidly accumulating, it saw that if a\r\nrevolution should occur, and the issue be made up between the tax-payers\r\nand the tax-receivers, the former could easily trample down a class with\r\nwhom they had no sympathy, and repudiate the debt. Accordingly, it has\r\nbeen the policy of the Government during these forty years to induce the\r\nmiddling and poorer classes to invest money in the public funds, through\r\nthe medium of savings banks, charitable institutions, and friendly\r\nsocieties. Not long since, there was found to be standing in the names\r\nof the commissioners of those associations some L25,000,000 of the\r\npublic debt, belonging to about 800,000 individual depositors and 16,000\r\nassociations--the latter representing probably 1,000,000 of people. Thus\r\nthe debt is actually owing to 2,000,000 of people, three-fourths of whom\r\nare of the middling and lower orders of society--the very class that\r\nwould be likely, if any, to foment a revolution of the Government. So\r\nlong as this state of things exists, it is safe to presume that the\r\npublic debt of Great Britain will never be repudiated, even by\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nThe taxes upon the people of that kingdom equal those of any other\r\nnation on earth. The annual average of direct tax paid to the Government\r\nby each man, woman, and child, exceeds L3. It is paid by less than\r\none-fifth of the population, making about $100, on an average, for each\r\ntax-payer, rich and poor. Nearly the whole, ultimately, comes directly\r\nand indirectly from the poorer classes, not in money solely, but in hard\r\nwork, high rents, mean fare, and low wages. These taxes are levied on\r\nland, meats, drinks, glass, malt, soap, spirits, windows, servants,\r\nhorses, carriages, dogs, newspapers, stamps, &c., to the last syllable\r\nof the record of human wants and uses.\r\n\r\nSydney Smith, in the Edinburgh Review, gives a graphic sketch of this\r\nall-pervading system of taxation. He says it involves \"taxes upon every\r\narticle which enters into the mouth, or covers the back, or is placed\r\nunder the foot. Taxes upon everything which is pleasant to see, hear,\r\nfeel, smell or taste. Taxes upon warmth, light, and locomotion. Taxes on\r\neverything on earth, and the waters under the earth; on everything which\r\ncomes from abroad or is grown at home. Taxes on the raw material; taxes\r\non every fresh value that is added to it by the industry of man. Taxes\r\non the sauce which pampers a man's appetite, and the drug that restores\r\nhim to health; on the ermine which decorates the judge, and the rope\r\nwhich hangs the criminal; on the poor man's salt, and the rich man's\r\nspice; on the brass nails of the coffin, and the ribbons of the bride.\r\nAt bed or board, couchant or levant, we must pay. The schoolboy whips\r\nhis taxed top; the beardless youth manages his taxed horse with a taxed\r\nbridle on a taxed road. The dying Englishman pours his medicine which\r\nhas paid 7 per cent., into a spoon which has paid 15 per cent.; flings\r\nhimself back upon his chintz bed which has paid 22 per cent.; makes his\r\nwill on an eight pound stamp, and expires in the arms of an apothecary\r\nwho has paid a license of a hundred pounds for the privilege of putting\r\nhim to death. His whole property is, then, immediately taxed from 2 to\r\n10 per cent. Besides the probate, large fees are demanded for burying\r\nhim in the chancel; his virtues are handed down to posterity on taxed\r\nmarble, and he is then gathered to his fathers, to be taxed no more.\"\r\n\r\nThe annual Government expenditures of Great Britain are nearly\r\n$400,000,000. The heaviest appropriation goes to pay the interest on the\r\npublic debt, which requires $150,000,000. The army and navy absorb\r\n$75,000,000. There are 2,000 pensioners, who receive annually\r\n$5,000,000 or $8,000,000. The Queen and royal family get some $5,500,000\r\nto supply the royal tables and stables, the royal babies and lap-dogs.\r\nFull $2,000,000 go to sinecures, such as the lord groom of the stole,\r\nthe lord keeper of her Majesty's buck-hounds, the lady sweeper of the\r\nMall, the lords wine-tasters, store-keepers, and packers, not omitting\r\nthe chief justices in Eyre, who have done nothing for a century, and the\r\nDuke of Wellington, who seems likely to live forever. To these\r\ngovernmental expenditures must be added the income of the Established\r\nChurch, whose Archbishop of Canterbury, pocketing, until recently, his\r\n$100,000 per year, mourns over the modern degeneracy which gives her\r\nclergy only 42,000,000 dollars annually.[14]\r\n\r\n  [14] I have often been obliged, in this chapter, to get my statistics by\r\n  striking _the average_ of a mass of contradictory authorities.\r\n\r\nWith these facts before us, we may form some estimate of the condition\r\nand prospects of the poor of a country where labor is abundant at twenty\r\ncents per day. Out on the inhuman policy which would prevent these\r\nhungry millions from emigrating to our broad American acres, which\r\nstretch westward almost to sundown, and on that remorseless policy which\r\nwould exclude them from these acres, by blasting the soil with the\r\nsirocco of chattel slavery!\r\n\r\nShould the number of public creditors in England become limited to two\r\nor three hundred thousand, its enormous debt, its immense annual\r\nexpenditures, and its consequent excessive taxation, might become the\r\noccasion of a revolution of its Government. Three of the most important\r\npolitical revolutions of modern times are, that of England in 1644, that\r\nof America in 1775, and that of France in 1789. Each happened when an\r\nattempt was made to levy taxes upon the people, to relieve the burdens\r\nupon the national treasury. That subject is so mixed up with the first\r\ndemonstrations of revolt, that, from being the mere _occasion_ of the\r\noutbreak, it has been often, if not generally, regarded as its _cause_.\r\nBut, to assign the resistance to the levying of poundage and ship-money\r\nby Charles I, without authority of Parliament--to assign the refusal to\r\npay a tax on tea and paper by the American Colonies, because imposed by\r\na legislature in which they were not represented--to assign the\r\nextraordinary assembling of the States General, by Louis XVI, to supply\r\na treasury exhausted by the foreign wars and domestic profligacies of\r\nprevious monarchs--to assign these as the causes of the mighty\r\nconvulsions which immediately followed, is assigning as _causes_ those\r\n_events_ which proved that the revolutions had already begun. It is\r\nreferring the terrible explosion solely to the spark which ignited the\r\ntrain which a century had been accumulating--is mistaking the cataracts\r\nover which the popular currents fell, for the remote fountains from\r\nwhich they rose. The people were discontented with their\r\nGovernments--they refused to contribute to their support--coercion drove\r\nthem to revolt. A people ripe for revolution are apt at making up an\r\nissue with their oppressors, and seizing an occasion to smite off their\r\nchains, and are quite as likely to avail themselves of an odious tax,\r\nwhich reaches all classes, as of greater outrages, which press only upon\r\nsingle individuals or a limited portion of the community. If England is\r\nconvulsed with a revolution, it is quite as probable to be occasioned by\r\nexcessive taxation as any other event.\r\n\r\nAnxious to avert dangers, as well as to relieve burdens, the great\r\nproblem which British financiers have set themselves to solve, since the\r\npeace of 1815, has been to devise some means of paying off the public\r\ndebt and reducing taxation. The boldest proposition to this end was\r\nbrought forward by Mr. Ricardo, a gentleman of the liberal school of\r\npolitics, an Edinburgh reviewer, celebrated for his controversy with Mr.\r\nMalthus, the writer on the laws of population and national wealth. For\r\nthe ten years subsequent to the peace of 1815, the financial\r\nembarrassments of England more than once drove her to the borders of\r\nnational bankruptcy. Mr. Ricardo, then being a member of the Commons,\r\nproposed, as the best mode of extricating the kingdom from those\r\nembarrassments, to tax its capital and property to the amount of, say\r\nL800,000,000, and pay the public debt off at once! He defended this\r\nscheme on the two-fold ground of justice and economy, contending that\r\nwhat a debtor owes ought always to be deducted from his property, and\r\nregarded as belonging to his creditors, and therefore should be given to\r\nthem--that all estimates of the wealth of the debtor, till such\r\ndeduction and payment are made, are false and delusive--that the then\r\npresent generation had contracted nearly the whole of the debt, and\r\ntherefore ought not to entail its payment upon posterity--and that, by\r\nimmediately discharging the debt, the expense of managing it, and\r\nraising the revenue to pay the interest upon it, would be a large saving\r\nto the nation. These propositions he maintained with that vigor of\r\nreasoning, fullness of detail, and clearness of illustration, for which\r\nhe was remarkable, and which won him a high place among the\r\npolitico-economical philosophers of his time. But his scheme fell of its\r\nown weight, having few supporters except himself. It was in advance of\r\nan age which never thought of paying, but only of borrowing. Though its\r\nauthor did not convince the Commons of its practicability or expediency,\r\nhe pretty thoroughly alarmed the capitalists and property-holders of the\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nAfter many years of labor on the part of Mr. Vansittart, Mr. Robinson,\r\nMr. Peel, Mr. Huskisson, and others, to _cipher_ the public debt into\r\nnon-existence, the hope of ever seeing it paid off seems to have given\r\nplace to despair, to be followed by apathy. No sane Englishman now looks\r\nto see it discharged till huge monopolies which oppress the industry of\r\nthe country are abolished, the system of Government entirely remodeled,\r\nand its expenses cut down to the lowest point of republican simplicity\r\nand economy. To talk of paying a debt of $4,000,000,000, whose annual\r\ninterest is $150,000,000, whilst $117,000,000 is annually wasted on\r\nthree blotches of the body politic, the Army, the Navy, and the Church,\r\nand 40,000 men own all the land of the kingdom, and every sixth man is a\r\npauper or a beggar, is simply an absurdity.[15]\r\n\r\n  [15] The author of the \"Comic Blackstone,\" first published in \"Punch,\"\r\n  says:--\"The only method of getting rid of the debt would be for the\r\n  sovereign to file a petition at the Insolvent Court in the name of the\r\n  nation, and solemnly take the benefit of the act, in the presence of the\r\n  fund-holders.\" About eighteen months since, Professor Newman, of the\r\n  London University, published an able pamphlet, proposing that the\r\n  interest on the debt should be paid for sixty years longer, after which\r\n  it should cease. There is a growing disposition in England to get rid of\r\n  the debt by some other mode than payment.\r\n\r\nTaking this view of the subject, the radical reformers of England have\r\nstruck at the root of the evil--a remodeling of the institutions of the\r\nState; and, in the departments of finance and taxation, have confined\r\ntheir efforts chiefly to the work of retrenching the Government\r\nexpenditures. Foremost among these, and especially in the latter field,\r\nhas stood the robust JOSEPH HUME. According to the forms of the British\r\nConstitution, the annual appropriations for the supply of the bottomless\r\ngulf of expenditure must take their rise in the House of Commons. And\r\nthere, before they commence their line of march to that bourne whence no\r\nshilling returns, they have to encounter the severe scrutiny and\r\ndetermined opposition of clear-headed, honest-hearted, open-mouthed\r\nJoseph Hume. He contests all money-bills item by item, fastening upon\r\nthem like a mastiff upon a gorged bullock.\r\n\r\nI was listening, a few years ago, to a debate in the House of Commons on\r\nthe civil list. Lord Stanley (then a member) had just closed an\r\nimpetuous speech, when a broad-shouldered, rather rough-looking man,\r\nrose, and deliberately taking off his hat, which seemed to be filled\r\nwith papers, commenced marshaling lazy sentences, under the command of\r\nbad rhetoric, to the music of a harsh voice. A pile of parliamentary\r\ndocuments lay on the seat by his side, and he held a bit of paper in\r\nhis hand, covered with figures. My friend informed me it was Mr. Hume.\r\nHe realized the portrait my mind's eye had drawn of the man who, by dint\r\nof tireless ciphering, had convinced the masses of England that they\r\nwere the mere working animals of the privileged orders. His brief, plain\r\nspeech was aimed at some measure supported by Stanley, by which the\r\npeople were to be cheated out of a few thousand pounds, to pamper some\r\ntitled feeder at the public crib. Stanley was racy and flowery. Hume's\r\nspeech resembled his lordship's as little as Euclid's problems do\r\nMilton's Paradise Lost. He explained the figures on his paper, and drove\r\nthe digits into Stanley by a few well-directed blows at \"treasury\r\nleeches,\" and sat down. Mr. Hume is a walking bundle of political\r\nstatistics. No other man will so patiently pursue a falsehood or a false\r\nestimate or account, through a wide waste of Parliamentary documents,\r\ntill he drives it into the sunlight of open exposure, as he. But as to\r\neloquence, he knows no more about it than a table of logarithms. He\r\nrarely makes a speech that does not contain a good deal of bad rhetoric,\r\nand an equal amount of arithmetical calculations. Entering Parliament\r\nthirty years ago, he immediately placed himself at the door of the\r\nnational treasury, which he has ever since watched with the dogged\r\nvigilance of a Cerberus. He has been the evil genius of Chancellors of\r\nthe Exchequer, worrying them more than the national debt or the public\r\ncreditors; whilst sinecurists, pensioners, and fat bishops, have\r\nreceived an annual Parliamentary roasting at his hands. Delving among\r\nthe corruptions of Church and State, he has laid bare the slimy\r\ncreatures that fatten on the roots of those institutions, and suck out\r\ntheir healthful nourishment. Bringing every proposed expenditure of\r\nmoney to the test of utility and the multiplication table, he has opened\r\nhis budget of statistics, night after night, and measured off columns of\r\ndamning figures by the yard and the hour, contesting the sum totals and\r\nthe details of the appropriation bills, backed sometimes by the whole\r\nforce of the liberal party, often sustained by only a few radical\r\nfollowers, and not infrequently left wholly alone. Of course, he is\r\noccasionally felt to be a bore. But nothing deters him from pursuing the\r\nline he has marked out. Sarcasm is lost upon him. Wit he despises.\r\nThreats have no terrors for him. Abuse only rebounds in the face of his\r\nassailant. The House may try to scrape or cough him down--Lord John\r\nRussell's reproaches may salute his ears--Sibthorpe's clumsy abuse may\r\nfall on his head--Stanley's fiery shafts may quiver in his flesh--Peel\r\nmay shower contempt upon him--but there stands clear-headed,\r\nhonest-hearted, unawed Joseph Hume, entrenched behind a pile of\r\nParliamentary papers, gathering up the fragments of his last night's\r\nspeech, and displaying fresh columns of figures, for a renewed attack on\r\nsome civil or ecclesiastical abuse, which has been hidden from\r\neverybody's sight but his, by the accumulated dust of a century. Under\r\nany other Government than one scandalously extravagant, and whose people\r\nare taxed to the last point of human endurance, such obstinacy as he has\r\nsometimes displayed, in obstructing the passage of financial measures,\r\nwould be wholly inexcusable. But every expedient which the wit or\r\npertinacity of man can devise, to defeat or diminish such plundering of\r\nthe masses as he witnesses every session of Parliament, is not only\r\ntolerable, but a sacred duty. The objects of his guardian vigilance\r\ngratefully appreciate his services, knowing that no other man has done\r\nso much to expose monetary abuses, and pull gorged leeches from the\r\nnational treasury, and turn them out to get their living from their\r\nnative earth.\r\n\r\nLet it not be supposed that Mr. Hume has devoted himself exclusively to\r\nexchequer budgets and appropriation bills. He has taken a leading share\r\nin all liberal measures, advocating Catholic emancipation, Parliamentary\r\nreform, West India abolition, and has long been an able champion of Free\r\nTrade. Nor do I mean it to be inferred from the \"free and easy\" style in\r\nwhich I have spoken of him, that he is not highly respectable, both as\r\nto talents and character. He is one of the best \"working-members\" of\r\nParliament, and by constant practice and perseverance he has obtained a\r\nposition amongst its able debaters. He was chosen Chairman of the Reform\r\nLeague, which was organized by Cobden and others, in the present House\r\nof Commons, to obtain equal representation and an enlarged suffrage, and\r\nhe is the nominal if not the real leader of the present movement for\r\nParliamentary reform.[16]\r\n\r\n  [16] Intimately associated with the subject of this chapter, is the\r\n  recent unsuccessful, but by no means abandoned movement of Mr. Cobden,\r\n  to reduce the government expenditures L10,000,000 per annum. His speech\r\n  on that occasion was worthy of the anti-corn-law leader. Those who know\r\n  him will need no assurance, that he will not give over till he has\r\n  carried a far more radical measure of retrenchment. He bides his time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n     Defects of the Reform Bill--Origin of Chartism--The \"People's\r\n     Charter\" Promulgated in 1838--The Riots of 1839 and 1842--The\r\n     Vengeance of the Government falls on O'Connor, Lovett, Collins,\r\n     Vincent, J. B. O'Brien, and Cooper--The Nonconformist Newspaper\r\n     Established by Mr. Miall--Mr. Sturge--Organization of the Complete\r\n     Suffrage Union--Character of the Chartists.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old-fashioned Tories declare that the Reform Bill inscribed\r\n\"Ichabod\" on the British Constitution. Though it ushered in a better\r\nera, an experience of seventeen years has proved that power has not yet\r\ndeparted from the privileged few.\r\n\r\nA few examples of its defects are given. For instance, Glasgow, with a\r\npopulation of 270,000, Manchester of 200,000, Birmingham of 160,000,\r\nLeeds of 130,000, were allowed two members of Parliament each; while\r\nCricklade, with a population of 1,600, Shoreham of 1,500, Retford of\r\n2,400, Wenlock of 2,400, were also allowed two members each. Finsbury,\r\nLambeth, Mary-le-bone, and Tower Hamlets, with an aggregate population\r\nof 1,100,000, had two members each, whose eight votes were balanced by\r\nthe members from Huntingdon, Marlborough, Dorchester, and Truro, with an\r\naggregate population of 12,500. The entire metropolis, with more than\r\n2,000,000 of inhabitants, received sixteen members, whose power in the\r\nHouse was nullified by the sixteen members of eight boroughs, with a\r\ntotal population of less than 24,000. Fifteen of the principal cities\r\nand towns in the kingdom, containing 3,500,000 people and 160,000\r\nelectors, were allowed thirty-two representatives, while the same number\r\nwas assigned to twenty-seven boroughs, containing 170,000 inhabitants\r\nand 6,900 electors.\r\n\r\nThe inequalities in the distribution of the suffrage are not less\r\nstriking. The number of males in the United Kingdom, of the age of\r\ntwenty-one years and upward, is about 7,000,000. The number of\r\nregistered electors is a little over 1,000,000. Thus, but about\r\none-seventh of the adult males is entitled to vote. The suffrage is most\r\nunequally distributed amongst this one-seventh. The House of Commons\r\nconsists of 658 members, which gives an average of full 1,500 electors\r\nto each member. But, 15 members are returned by less than 200 electors\r\neach--50 by less than 300 each--100 by less than 500 each--and so on,\r\ntill careful calculations make it apparent that a clear majority of the\r\nHouse is returned by 200,000 electors, or one-fifth of the entire body,\r\nwhich body consists of only one-seventh of the adult male population.\r\n\r\nIn the distribution of members, reference was had to the supremacy of\r\nthe landlord interest. Thus, South Lancashire, which swarms with a\r\nmanufacturing population of more than 1,000,000, and has 25,000\r\nelectors, was balanced by aristocratic Lymington, with 3,300\r\ninhabitants, and 150 electors, whom any lord can buy. West Yorkshire,\r\nthe seat of the woolen interest, with 1,200,000 people and 40,000\r\nelectors, was given the same weight in the House as any two of numerous\r\nboroughs, with a joint population of 6,000, whose 400 or 500 electors\r\nwere the cowering vassals of some great landed proprietor. In Lancashire\r\nand Yorkshire, whose skies are blackened with the smoke of their\r\nmanufactories, there is one member for every 55,000 inhabitants, while\r\nrural Rutland has one for every 9,000, and corn-growing Dorset one for\r\nevery 13,000. Manchester and Salford, the center of the cotton interest,\r\nwith 300,000 people, send three members, and agricultural\r\nBuckinghamshire, with less than half that amount of population, sends\r\neleven.[17]\r\n\r\n  [17] Entire precision has not been aimed at in the foregoing statistics,\r\n  \"round numbers\" being sufficiently accurate for my purpose.\r\n\r\nThe usual complexion of the House is alike caused by and aggravates the\r\nevils that spring from unequal representation and partially distributed\r\nsuffrage. In the House previous to the present, there were 205 members\r\nclosely related to the peers of the realm; 153 officers of the army and\r\nnavy; 63 placemen; and 247 patrons of church livings. Of the 658\r\nmembers, there were only about 200 who had not either title, office,\r\nplace, pension, or patronage. And the same is substantially true of the\r\npresent House.\r\n\r\nThese details, which might be multiplied indefinitely, will enable a\r\nvery ordinary arithmetician to answer the question, which the CHARTISTS\r\nhave rung in the public ear of England: \"Does the Reformed House of\r\nCommons represent the people of Great Britain, and Ireland?\"\r\n\r\nThe meager fruits brought forth by the Parliament elected under the\r\nreform bill, convinced a large mass of the enlightened working men, that\r\nLabor must look for relief to a radical change in the constitution of\r\nthe popular branch of the legislature. They agreed upon a fundamental\r\nlaw for Parliamentary reform, to which they gave the name of \"The\r\nPeople's Charter.\" Hence their name, \"Chartists.\" The Charter, having\r\nbeen adopted by large numbers of Workingmen's Associations throughout\r\nthe country, was ratified and promulgated in August, 1838, by 200,000\r\npersons of the laboring classes, assembled from all parts of the\r\nkingdom, at Birmingham.\r\n\r\nThe outline of the Charter was mainly the work of Mr. William Lovett, a\r\nLondon cabinet-maker, one of God's nobility. It was perfected by Messrs.\r\nD. O'Connell, Hume, Bowring, Roebuck, Wakely, P. Thompson, and Crawford,\r\nthen members of the Commons, who prepared the draft of an act of\r\nParliament embodying its provisions. The leading points in the Charter\r\nare six, viz: Universal Suffrage, Voting by Ballot, Annual Parliaments,\r\nEqual Electoral Districts, No Property Qualification of Representatives,\r\nand Payment of Members for their Services. It is remarkable that these\r\nidentical reforms were proposed forty years before, in an elaborate\r\nreport by a committee of the \"Friends of the People,\" of which the\r\nillustrious Charles James Fox was chairman.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the essence of Chartism. Its principles, which fall like\r\nhousehold words on the American ear, filled the heart of British\r\naristocracy with dismay and wrath. Nor were the terror and indignation\r\nabated when their promulgation was followed by laying the \"Great\r\nPetition,\" in favor of the People's Charter, bearing one million two\r\nhundred thousand names, on the tables of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nThe Chartists were chiefly laboring men, dwelling in cities and towns.\r\nThey justly expected countenance and aid from liberal Whigs who had\r\nprotested against the aristocratic features of the Reform bill. They\r\nreceived neither. The cause of national representation was regarded as\r\nonly the poor man's question, and as such it was left exclusively to the\r\npoor. The poor, thus abandoned to fight the battle single-handed and\r\nalone, nourished a fatal resentment against all above them. Far-sighted\r\nand pure-minded men among them urged the superiority of intellectual and\r\nmoral means over brute force, in promoting their objects. Keen-eyed\r\ndemagogues were not wanting to fan their resentment, and remind them\r\nthat in their swart arms dwelt the physical strength of the country.\r\nDeprived of political power, (for the great majority were non-voters,)\r\nthe mass lent a greedy ear to these wily counselors. Chartism being a\r\nknife-and-fork question to the laboring poor, starving men were easily\r\ninduced to seize the pike and the torch under a promise of bread.\r\nPreparations for a rising were made. It was attempted in 1839. A few\r\nriots occurred, a few houses were gutted, a few wheat-ricks fired, a few\r\ncart-mares shot, and some human blood shed. The vengeance of the\r\nGovernment descended upon the deluded men--the military crushed the\r\nembryo insurrection--the courts imprisoned and transported the\r\nleaders--the noble principles of the Charter were involved in the stigma\r\nwhich fastened upon a portion of its advocates--the middle classes, who\r\nmight have averted the disaster, were, for a season, frightened into a\r\nrenunciation of the principles they had maintained during the\r\ndiscussions on the Reform Bill. A similar outbreak, stimulated by\r\nsimilar causes, and followed by similar consequences, occurred in 1842.\r\n\r\nGovernmental vengeance fell alike on the men of peace and the men of\r\nviolence. Feargus O'Connor, a hot-headed bully and coward, who had\r\nstigmatized the pacific doctrines as \"moral-force humbuggery,\" was sent\r\nto York Castle. William Lovett and John Collins, two noble specimens of\r\nthe working classes, spent a year in Warwick jail. The young and\r\nbrilliant Henry Vincent was lodged in a dungeon two years, for making\r\nthe Welsh mountaineers \"discontented with the Government.\" J. Bronterre\r\nO'Brien, a legitimate son of the land of Emmett, suffered twelve months\r\nin Lancaster Castle. Thomas Cooper, who dropped the awl, took up the\r\npen, and wrote the celebrated poem, \"The Purgatory of Suicides,\" was\r\nimprisoned two years and a quarter in Stafford jail. Other less\r\nconspicuous persons were incarcerated at home, or banished beyond the\r\nseas.\r\n\r\nThe election of 1841 returned a large Tory majority to Parliament,\r\ndissolved old party connections, and drove the radical reformers of the\r\nmiddle and working classes once more together in opposition to the\r\ncommon foe. _The Nonconformist_, a weekly newspaper, just then\r\nestablished in London, and conducted with marked ability by Mr. Edward\r\nMiall, took up the subject of a reform in Parliament, in a series of\r\narticles which powerfully argued the right of the working men to the\r\nfranchise, and the necessity of an equalization of the representation.\r\nThese essays were subsequently printed in a pamphlet and widely\r\ncirculated. Their calm and cogent reasonings, their hearty and fervid\r\nappeals, arrested general attention. Mr. Miall gave to his scheme the\r\nname of \"Complete Suffrage.\" It only remained for a practical man like\r\nJoseph Sturge to give to what was so far but a happy theory, the form\r\nand vitality of an organized movement.\r\n\r\nAfter some preliminary meetings, Mr. Sturge, who had recently returned\r\nto England from an investigation of the electoral system of the United\r\nStates, assembled a National Convention, or Conference, at Birmingham,\r\nin April, 1842, composed of delegates favorable to the main points of\r\nthe \"People's Charter,\" but opposed on principle and policy to all\r\nresort to intimidation or force in the accomplishment of their objects.\r\nMany of the best and brightest minds of the kingdom were present. During\r\nits four days' session, the debates were animated; the feeling earnest\r\nand warm; but the excitement glowed rather than flamed. The Chartists\r\nwere represented by Lovett, O'Connor, Collins, Vincent, and O'Brien,\r\nwhile Sturge, Miall, Rev. Thomas Spencer, and Rev. Dr. Ritchie,\r\nrepresented the Complete Suffragists. After full discussion, the six\r\npoints of the Charter were adopted, and an association, called \"The\r\nNational Complete Suffrage Union,\" was formed.\r\n\r\nThe cause was now on a good foundation, and under wise control. The same\r\nmonth of the Conference, Mr. Sharman Crawford, a judicious friend of the\r\nnon-voting millions, divided the House of Commons on a motion in favor\r\nof complete suffrage. Among the sixty-nine members who voted with him\r\nwere Messrs. Bowring, Cobden, Duncombe, Gibson, Napier, O'Connell,\r\nRoebuck, Strickland, Villiers, Wakely, and Ward, all of whom held\r\nprominent positions in the House.\r\n\r\nIt would transcend my limits to detail the progress of the Complete\r\nSuffrage movement since its organization in 1842. During these seven\r\nyears of Corn-Law and Irish agitation, so unfavorable for fixing the\r\npublic mind upon the question of an organic reform in Parliament, the\r\nComplete Suffragists have discussed their great proposition before the\r\npeople, have returned several able advocates to the House, deepened the\r\nconviction that a thorough reoerganization of the Legislature is a _sine\r\nqua non_ to future radical reforms, and aroused a determination to place\r\nthat subject on the Parliamentary \"cards\" so soon as matters that now\r\noccupy them are disposed of.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the Chartists proper have increased their numbers, as\r\ntheir Monster Petition of many millions, presented to Parliament during\r\nthe last year, proves; and with the increase of numbers has come an\r\nabatement of their belligerent spirit, as their law-abiding conduct on\r\nthat occasion shows; thus inspiring the hope of all good men, that when\r\nthe great battle between the laboring many and the governing few shall\r\nbe fought, Chartists and Suffragists will unite in a common struggle to\r\nmake the Commons House of Parliament the representative of the common\r\npeople of the realm.[18]\r\n\r\n  [18] One or two recent divisions in the House of Commons are no\r\n  criterion for determining the strength of the Free Suffragists and\r\n  Chartists. That subject is not now on the \"cards.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be doing injustice to some of the clearest-headed men in\r\nEngland to suppose that they for one moment regard the most radical\r\nreform in Parliament as the final remedy for the enormous evils that\r\nmake one-eighth of the people of the realm absolute paupers, and\r\none-fourth of the entire population paupers in all but the name. They\r\nlook to the establishment of such a reform only as affording to the\r\ndepressed classes an essential means for remodeling, on a basis of\r\nequality, the whole Governmental structure. They seek it, not as an end,\r\nbut as an instrument to attain an end--a John the Baptist to herald the\r\ntimes and the men that shall make the crooked straight, the rough\r\nsmooth, the inequalities level.\r\n\r\nScarcely any body of men have been regarded with more unintelligent\r\nhorror, or subjected to more unreasonable denunciation, by the higher\r\nclasses of England, than the Chartists. And yet, no section of British\r\nreformers are more worthy of admiration for the principles they avow, or\r\nof sympathy for the persecutions they have endured. It has been my good\r\nfortune to make the acquaintance of several of these men, to attend some\r\nof their meetings, and read many of their publications. I have never\r\ntaken by the hand nobler members of the human family, nor listened to\r\nspeeches that glowed with more eloquent devotion to the rights of man,\r\nnor perused papers more thoroughly imbued with the democratic sentiment,\r\nand which inculcated lofty principles in a style of more calm and lucid\r\nreasoning. Their publications dwell with emphasis upon the blessings of\r\npeace, the superiority of moral over physical means in the attainment of\r\nends, the importance of education, of industry and economy, of\r\nself-reliance without arrogance, and of an independent and manly bearing\r\nin their intercourse with the world. Bad men are among them, who have\r\noften imposed upon their ignorance or inflamed their passions, goading\r\nthem to violence and crime. But the mass are as far removed from the\r\nstate of barbarism and brutality, which their traducers have assigned to\r\nthem, as _they_ are from the utterance of truth or the practice of\r\ncharity.\r\n\r\nIt stirs the blood not a little to see such men as Lovett, Collins,\r\nVincent, O'Brien, and Cooper, suffer through long years, in dark and\r\nfilthy cells, for teaching the people to be \"discontented\" with a\r\nGovernment that first denies them any voice in its administration, and\r\nthen taxes them down to the starvation point, that it may pamper a\r\nbloated priesthood and an overbearing aristocracy at home, and build\r\nnavies and equip armies to scour the seas and scourge unoffending tribes\r\nin the uttermost parts of the earth. However, those who know John Bull\r\nbest say the only way to manage him is to mingle a little threatening\r\nwith a good deal of blarney, when the conceited old bully, after a\r\nfearful amount of bluster, will yield a point--as witness Catholic\r\nEmancipation, Parliamentary Reform, and Corn-Law Repeal. Perhaps these\r\npacific counselors are right; though a James Otis, or a Patrick Henry,\r\nwith the cry of \"No taxation without representation!\" on their lips,\r\nwould recommend that the towers of Windsor, and the minarets of Lambeth,\r\nbe pitched instantly into the Thames.\r\n\r\nA more particular notice of some of the persons who have acted prominent\r\nparts in the transactions above detailed, will be given in the next\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n     Chartists and Complete Suffragists--Feargus O'Connor--William\r\n     Lovett--John Collins--Henry Vincent--Thomas Cooper--Edward\r\n     Miall--Reverend Thomas Spencer.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this chapter, I will give brief notices of some of the more prominent\r\nChartists and Free-Suffragists.\r\n\r\nFEARGUS O'CONNOR has been styled \"The Great Chartist Leader.\" In\r\nadvocating the cause, he has suffered for his imprudences, if not for\r\nhis principles. He is made up in about equal degrees of the braggart and\r\nthe coward, the demagogue and the democrat--a legitimate product of the\r\nrotten institutions and turbulent times in which he was born and has\r\nflourished. With many good qualities and many bad ones, he had not the\r\nmoral bravery to lead a reformation, nor the physical courage to head a\r\nrevolution. Aspiring to do both, and wanting capacity for either, he\r\nfailed in each. Respect for an impulsive man who has proclaimed good\r\nprinciples in bad times, and sympathy for a weak man who has felt the\r\nthorn of persecution from worse hands than his own, induce me to forbear\r\nfurther remark on the foibles and follies of one who is shorn of his\r\ninfluence to do much future good or evil. Better for Chartism if he had\r\nlived and died a Tory; though, with all his sins, he will be kindly\r\nremembered when Toryism rots in contempt.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM LOVETT'S manly virtues and vigorous sense adorn a noble\r\nenterprise. Born in extremest poverty, he has struggled upward against\r\nthe crushing weight of factious systems, to an influential position in\r\nsociety. While a young man, he was drafted into the militia--refused to\r\nbe degraded into a machine to kill men at the word of command--was\r\narraigned before a magistrate for the offense--terrified the justice by\r\nthe boldness and ability of his defense--and was discharged from the\r\nservice after seeing his little property confiscated and his family\r\nreduced almost to beggary. This petty tyranny fixed him in the purpose\r\nof preparing himself to aid in remodeling institutions that taxed him to\r\nthe marrow, without allowing him any voice in the selection of his\r\nrulers. He worked at his trade of cabinet-making by day, and cultivated\r\nhis mind by night. Throwing himself into all movements for the\r\nimprovement of the laboring classes, he first attracted general notice\r\nby his connection with the London Working Men's Association, established\r\nin 1836. The many able addresses which this central body issued to the\r\nworking men of the kingdom, and to the laboring classes in Belgium,\r\nPoland, and Canada, were prepared by him. These led the way for the\r\nChartist movement. In 1838, he assisted Messrs. O'Connell, Roebuck, and\r\nother members of Parliament, in preparing \"The People's Charter;\" his\r\npart of the work consisting in drafting, theirs in revising, this noble\r\nand painfully celebrated document.\r\n\r\nOne of the main originators of the Chartist enterprise, he now gave to\r\nit his whole energies; and well would it have been had his pacific\r\ndisposition controlled its direction. The National Convention of\r\nChartists was in session in Birmingham in 1839. The people of that town,\r\nas was their wont, were holding a meeting in \"The Bull-ring,\" to discuss\r\nquestions of reform. The police, part of whom had been specially sent\r\nfrom London, were ordered to break up the meeting. They rushed upon the\r\nassemblage, and, with their bludgeons, knocked down men, women, and\r\nchildren, and dispersed the meeting. Mr. Lovett, who was secretary to\r\nthe Convention, drew up and presented to that body a manly protest\r\nagainst these outrages. It was printed and circulated through the town.\r\nFor writing that paper, he and John Collins (who had carried the\r\nmanuscript to the printer) were arrested for sedition, thrust into a\r\ndungeon, indicted, tried, convicted, and sentenced to a year's\r\nimprisonment in Warwick jail. On the trial, Lovett defended himself with\r\nskill, and his address to the jury commanded general admiration. While\r\nin prison, Lovett and Collins published a pamphlet of 130 pages,\r\nentitled \"Chartism: A Plan for the Education and Improvement of the\r\nPeople.\" It is able and eloquent, filled with the noblest sentiments,\r\nand contains suggestions for the instruction and elevation of the\r\nmasses, which would, if acted upon by the government, place England a\r\ncentury in advance of her present position. Near the close of their\r\nconfinement, they wrote another paper, which I transcribe entire. The\r\nMelbourne Administration, \"which meant but little, nor meant that little\r\nwell,\" became ashamed of its treatment of Lovett and Collins, and\r\noffered to release them on their entering into bonds to keep the peace.\r\nHere is their reply. Read it, and see how contemptible a nobleman looks\r\nin the hands of a cabinet-maker and a tool-maker:\r\n\r\n                                         \"WARWICK JAIL, May 6, 1840.\r\n\r\n     \"_To the Right Honorable the Marquis of Normanby, Her Majesty's\r\n     Secretary of State for the Home Department:_\r\n\r\n     \"MY LORD: The visiting magistrate of the county jail of Warwick\r\n     having read to us a communication, dated Whitehall, May 5, and\r\n     signed S. M. Phillips, in which it is stated that your Lordship\r\n     will recommend us to Her Majesty for a remission of the remaining\r\n     part of our sentence, provided we are willing to enter into our\r\n     recognizance in L50 each for our good behavior for one year, we beg\r\n     respectfully to submit the following as our answer. To enter into\r\n     any bond for our future good conduct would be an admission of past\r\n     guilt; and however a prejudicial jury may have determined that the\r\n     resolutions we caused to be published, condemnatory of the attack\r\n     of the police, were a violation of the law of libel, we cannot\r\n     bring ourselves to believe that any criminality attaches to our\r\n     past conduct. We have, however, suffered the penalty of nearly ten\r\n     months' imprisonment for having, in common with a large portion of\r\n     the public press, and a large majority of our countrymen,\r\n     expressed that condemnatory opinion. We have been about the first\r\n     political victims who have been classed and punished as\r\n     misdemeanants and felons, because we happen to be of the working\r\n     class. Our healths have been injured, and our constitutions\r\n     seriously undermined by the treatment we have already experienced;\r\n     but we are disposed to suffer whatever future punishment may be\r\n     inflicted upon us, rather than enter into any such terms as those\r\n     proposed by your Lordship.\r\n\r\n     \"We remain your Lordship's most obedient servants,\r\n\r\n                                                \"WILLIAM LOVETT,\r\n                                                \"JOHN COLLINS.\"\r\n\r\nHaving been confined to a narrow, filthy cell, and fed on the meanest\r\nfare, Mr. Lovett's health was so seriously impaired, that he did not\r\nrecover his wonted vigor till nearly two years after his release from\r\nprison.\r\n\r\nMr. Lovett was a member of the Birmingham Complete Suffrage Conference\r\nin 1842, and his well-balanced mind and lucid speeches gave him a\r\nleading position in that body. For a few years past, he has been engaged\r\nin publishing works adapted to the wants of the laboring classes, and\r\nhis pen has been active in their cause. He was the publisher of\r\n\"Howitt's Journal,\" and contributed some of the best papers that\r\nappeared on its pages. In person he is tall and gentlemanly, has an\r\nintellectual countenance, and, take him all in all, is a rare specimen\r\nof the rich ore that lies embedded under the crust of British\r\naristocracy.\r\n\r\nJOHN COLLINS, like William Lovett, came up from the ground tier of\r\nBritish society, and has brought along with him more of the marks of his\r\n\"order\" than Mr. L. He has rode out a good deal of rough weather in\r\ndefense of Chartist principles. On his release from Warwick jail, he was\r\nreceived with the warmest enthusiasm by congregated thousands of his\r\nBirmingham neighbors. He afterward made a tour of Scotland, addressing\r\naudiences in the principal towns. I listened to one of his speeches. My\r\nmind having been filled with prejudices against him, I was prepared to\r\nsee a monster. But there stood before me a stout, bold man, uttering\r\nthe loftiest truths in a practical and pointed style, and with a tone\r\nand bearing conciliatory but firm--a man earnest in vindicating the\r\ndepressed classes, who had shown courage in peril, endured persecution\r\nwithout repining, and now received applause without vanity--a nobleman\r\nby nature, a tool-maker by trade, but who never tried to make a tool of\r\nothers, and was the last person who would submit to be made one himself.\r\n\r\nThe name of the young and eloquent HENRY VINCENT thrills the hearts of\r\nmillions of Britain's laboring poor. While an apprentice in a London\r\nprinting-office, he aided by extra work during the day in supporting a\r\ndestitute mother and her children, while midnight generally found him\r\nabsorbed in some book adapted to expand his mind. His intellect outran\r\nhis years, and he became a radical reformer when yet a boy. At the age\r\nof 14, he made a speech to his juvenile companions on the then\r\nengrossing subject of Catholic Emancipation. The French Revolution next\r\npossessed his enthusiastic soul. He stood dumb with emotion when he\r\nfirst saw the handbill at the door of the newspaper office, headed\r\n\"Revolution in France!\" He rushed home, got his sixpence, bought the\r\npaper, and run through the streets announcing the event to all whom he\r\nmet. Soon followed the Reform Bill excitement, which absorbed his\r\nenergies. Although but 16 or 17 years old, he was chosen a member of a\r\nPolitical Union, and participated in its proceedings. Arriving at his\r\nmajority in 1836, he resolved to consecrate his powers to the elevation\r\nof the laboring and disfranchised classes of the people. He joined with\r\nMr. Lovett in the Chartist movements of 1837-8, traveled the country as\r\na lecturer, and was immediately ranked among the most vigorous and\r\nbrilliant advocates of The Charter. Such was his success among the hardy\r\nmountaineers of Wales, that the Government became alarmed, marked him\r\nfor its victim, and, on his coming to London to visit his widowed\r\nmother, dragged him from her dwelling at dead of night, on a charge of\r\nsedition, thrust him into a dungeon, tried him, convicted him, and sent\r\nhim a year to Monmouth jail. The crime proved upon him was, using\r\nviolent language and making the people discontented with the Government!\r\nJust before the close of his term of imprisonment, he was again\r\narraigned on a similar charge, and doomed to another twelve months'\r\nincarceration. While in prison, he was treated with such barbarity that\r\nfears were entertained of a rescue by the Welsh, with whom he was highly\r\npopular, and he was removed to London. His journey thither was a\r\ntriumphant procession, crowds gathering and cheering him at several of\r\nthe principal towns on the route. While confined in a solitary cell in\r\nthe London penitentiary, Mr. Sergeant Talfourd brought his case before\r\nParliament, eulogized his character and talents, and arraigned the\r\nGovernment for the harsh treatment inflicted upon him. This woke up Lord\r\nNormanby, the Home Secretary, who visited Vincent, heard some very plain\r\ntalk, had him removed to Oakham jail, and furnished with decent\r\nlodgings, and pen, ink, and paper. After suffering twenty-two months,\r\n(the Government having remitted two,) this pure-hearted young\r\nphilanthropist was released, and the same day partook of a complimentary\r\ndinner, when he made a speech in defense of his principles and conduct,\r\nworthy of the theme and the man.\r\n\r\nSoon afterward, at the general election in 1841, Mr. Vincent was invited\r\nto contest the borough of Banbury for a seat in Parliament, the whole\r\nbody of non-electors, and a large minority of the electors, being in his\r\nfavor. On the morning of the election, (the result being very doubtful\r\nbetween the Whigs and Tories,) a committee of the former offered him a\r\nlarge sum of money to withdraw from the contest. He had scarcely spurned\r\nthe proposal, when a Tory deputation offered him L1,000 to abandon the\r\nfield. He refused the bribe with scorn. He was defeated, but he retired\r\nwith honor, leaving hundreds of converts to his principles behind him.\r\nHe subsequently, on special request stood for Ipswich and Tavistock,\r\nhaving failed of carrying the latter borough by only 44 votes, against\r\nthe combined power of the House of Bedford. At the general election of\r\n1847, he polled a very large vote in Plymouth. His chief object in\r\nyielding to the solicitation of his friends to mingle in these contests\r\nwas, to improve the opportunity they afforded him for bringing thorough\r\ndemocratic principles before the people.\r\n\r\nMr. Vincent united with the Free Suffragists in 1842, and during the\r\npast seven years he has traversed England and Scotland, addressing\r\nmultitudes in favor of Peace, Temperance, Education, Free Trade, and\r\nParliamentary Reform, winning a high place among the advocates of\r\nradical reform. His speeches are a continuous flow of rapid, fervid\r\neloquence, that illuminates the reason, kindles the imagination, and\r\nfires the heart. In person, he is below the middle size, symmetrically\r\nformed, with very handsome features, graceful and elastic in his action\r\nas a deer, and his voice thrills the blood like a war-trumpet.[19]\r\n\r\n  [19] The trials of Lovett, Collins, Vincent, and others, are reported\r\n  briefly in the 9th volume of Carrington & Payne's reports. The legal\r\n  points raised on the trials chiefly make up the reports.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS COOPER is another original genius, who has forced his way into\r\nsunlight through the thick shell of British caste. Eating the bitter\r\nbread of poverty during childhood, he contrived, by means that throw\r\nfiction into the shade, to gratify a native taste for reading, drawing,\r\nand music. Laboring on a shoemaker's bench from the age of fifteen to\r\ntwenty-three, he snatched from toil the opportunity to acquire a\r\nrespectable knowledge of the Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and French languages,\r\nand of Algebra and Geometry--to commit to memory considerable portions\r\nof Shakspeare and Milton--to peruse the works of Hooker, Cudworth,\r\nStillingfleet, Warburton, and Paley--and to compose some poetry and\r\nessays of his own. This he did by robbing sleep of its wonted hours, and\r\nwhile his miserable wages afforded a pittance barely sufficient to keep\r\nhim and his mother from starving.\r\n\r\nAt the age of twenty-three, he dropped his awl and hammer, and emerged\r\ninto the world. For ten years he buffeted a sea of troubles, dividing\r\nhis time between teaching country schools and writing for newspapers;\r\nnow accumulating a choice library of 500 volumes, and then parting with\r\nit, volume by volume, for bread. In 1841, while engaged as a reporter\r\nfor the _Leicestershire Mercury_, he was directed to report a Chartist\r\nlecture. It was the first he had heard, and its principles found an echo\r\nin his bosom. He commenced a lecturing tour in support of the Charter,\r\nvisiting, among other places, the Staffordshire potteries. While in that\r\nregion, in 1842, occurred those serious disturbances which for weeks\r\ntossed the Midland counties on a wild tempest of riots. At first, the\r\nobject was to raise the wages of the operatives by a general \"strike.\"\r\nDemagogues fanned the flame, till it broke loose in arson, pillage, and\r\nother violent acts, resulting in a few instances in loss of life. Cooper\r\nwas arrested, and finally arraigned on four indictments for riot,\r\nsedition, and arson. He was tried, and, though acquitted on the more\r\nserious charge, was convicted of the minor offenses, against every\r\nprinciple of law or reason. He was sentenced to two years and three\r\nmonths' imprisonment. One of the trials lasted ten days. Cooper defended\r\nhimself with great ability, proving no unworthy antagonist for Sir\r\nWilliam Follett. The barbarous treatment he received in prison gave him\r\nrheumatism, neuralgia, and other diseases; but it gave to the world \"The\r\nPurgatory of Suicides.\" This poem appeared soon after his liberation, in\r\n1845, having been composed in Stafford jail. It was highly eulogized in\r\nthe Eclectic, Britannia, and other literary periodicals, and met with\r\nimmediate success. In the preface, the author proudly says:\r\n\r\n     \"I am poor, and have been plunged into debt by the persecution of\r\n     my enemies; but I have a consolation to know, that my course was\r\n     dictated by heart-felt zeal to relieve the sufferings and\r\n     oppressions of my fellow-men. Sir William Follett was entombed with\r\n     pomp, and a host of titled great ones, of every shade of party,\r\n     attended the laying of his clay in the grave. They propose now to\r\n     erect a monument to his memory. Let them build it; the\r\n     self-educated shoemaker has also reared his, and, despite its\r\n     imperfections, he has a calm confidence that, though the product of\r\n     poverty, and suffering, and misery, it will outlast the posthumous\r\n     stone block that may be erected to perpetuate the memory of the\r\n     titled lawyer.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cooper subsequently published other works, assisted in editing\r\nDouglas Jerrold's Magazine, contributed to Howitt's Journal, and\r\ndelivered courses of lectures before various literary and scientific\r\ninstitutions in London; but, under all circumstances, giving his heart\r\nand his hand to all efforts to elevate the class of society in which he\r\nis proud to have had his origin.\r\n\r\nThe bare names of those who have borne a prominent part in the Chartist\r\nmovement would fill pages. I must leave them, and have time to notice\r\ntwo men only who may be classed as Complete Suffragists proper, they\r\nnever having acted with the Chartists.\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARD MIALL has been for several years the editor of _The\r\nNonconformist_. He formerly officiated as a dissenting minister.\r\nCompetent judges have pronounced this newspaper one of the ablest of the\r\nEnglish journals; its conductor one of the ablest of English editors.\r\nUndoubtedly it stands in the front rank of _religious_ newspapers. It\r\nhas a clear comprehension of the mission of a religious journal in the\r\ncurrent crisis of English affairs, and fulfills it with courage,\r\nintegrity, and ability. It is the organ of no sect, but reflects the\r\nviews of radical reformers of all denominations. It is the organ of no\r\nparty, but utters the sentiments of the friends of progress. While it\r\ngives much attention to ecclesiastical affairs, it discusses all\r\npolitical matters that occupy the public mind, probing subjects to the\r\ncore, laying bare corruption, and excoriating evil-doers in Church and\r\nState, without fear or favor, ranting or cant. The leading\r\ncharacteristic of its editorials is their searching and philosophical\r\nstyle of argument; while the hue of the rhetoric, the texture of the\r\ncomposition, are lustrous and compact, equaling in beauty and grandeur\r\nthe essays of the first class of periodicals. It occasionally indulges\r\nin the most pungent sarcasm and lively wit, all the more biting and\r\ninspiring for being exceptions to the general rule. Every line breathes\r\na deep earnestness for truth, and a warm sympathy with humanity. The\r\nwritings of Mr. Miall are models of English composition.\r\n\r\nAt the last general election, Mr. Miall contested Halifax as the radical\r\ncandidate; and his speeches during the canvass were only surpassed in\r\nstrength and acuteness by the emanations of his own pen. In the outward\r\nsemblances of the orator--the mere frame and gilding--he falls below the\r\nexpectations of those familiar with his writings. An attenuated frame, a\r\nthin voice, a stiff demeanor, a monotonous gesticulation, seem too\r\nslight a frame-work to sustain the operations of so mighty a mental\r\nmachine as his. Glorious dawn of England's better day, when the seats of\r\nher Parliament are thickly sprinkled with such men as Miall, Cobden,\r\nSturge, Thompson, and Vincent.\r\n\r\nHaving stopped a moment to look at the plain garb of a Nonconformist\r\nminister, we will glance at a hardly less radical reformer, arrayed in\r\nthe canonicals of the Church of England, \"as by law established\"--Rev.\r\nTHOMAS SPENCER. As this gentleman has traveled and spoken extensively in\r\nour country, it will not surprise Americans to be told that, though a\r\nclergyman of the Establishment, he is also a thorough teetotaler, the\r\nenemy of commercial monopolies, a complete suffragist, and almost a\r\ndemocrat. Possessing superior talents, a rich flow of eloquence, a\r\ncommanding and graceful person, Mr. Spencer has been eminently\r\nsuccessful in instructing and delighting large audiences of his\r\ncountrymen, and commending to their judgments and tastes themes that\r\nwould have been repulsive in the hands of men of less aristocratic\r\nassociations. He took a prominent part in the Birmingham Conference of\r\n1842, which organized the National Complete Suffrage Union, and was\r\nelected a member of the General Council of that association. He has\r\nmingled much with the poor of England, feels deeply for their wrongs,\r\nand boldly advocates their rights. How beautiful and cheering is the\r\nlight reflected upon the wide-weltering chaos of surrounding darkness,\r\nby such clergymen as Thomas Spencer and Baptist Noel. They, as well as\r\nmany kindred spirits of the Establishment, and the great mass of\r\ndissenting ministers, do not esteem it incompatible with their dignity,\r\nnor unbecoming their sacred calling, to take an active part in all\r\nquestions, whether political or ecclesiastical, which vitally affect the\r\ninterests of their fellow-subjects. I have never heard that their labors\r\nfor the people in the forum diminished their influence over the people\r\nin the pulpit. Nay, it rather increases that influence by convincing the\r\npeople that, in becoming ministers, they did not lose their interest in\r\nanything which concerns the well-being of their fellow men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\n     Ireland, her Condition and Prospects--The Causes of her Misery--The\r\n     Remedies for the Evils which afflict her.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Irish Question\" is environed with peculiar difficulties. An\r\nAmerican might shrink from discussing what has puzzled and baffled\r\nIrishmen on both sides of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThe poetic, fancy view of Ireland is a mountain nymph, with flowing\r\ngarments, wavy ringlets, glowing countenance, enrapt eye, and Venus-like\r\nfingers, thrilling the strings of a harp. The prosaic, real view is more\r\nlike a mother, seated on the mud floor of a bog cabin, clad in rags,\r\nwith disheveled hair, pinched features, eyes too hot and dry for tears,\r\nand skinny fingers, dividing a rotten potato amongst a brood of\r\nfamishing children. Thanks to some of her orators, they have ceased to\r\nrave in fine frenzy about \"the first flower of the earth, and the first\r\ngem of the sea.\" All friends of Ireland, native and alien, should stop\r\nranting about \"flowers,\" \"gems,\" \"Emerald Isles,\" \"Tara's Halls,\" \"St.\r\nPatrick,\" and such rhapsodies, and come down to the things of time and\r\nsense. Potatoes, as a standing dish, may grow stale; but to a starving\r\npeople they are \"roast beef and two dollars a day,\" compared with a\r\nsurfeit of antiquated heroics. And yet, take up the report of a meeting\r\nfor the relief of Ireland, whether held in Dublin or Washington, and\r\nhalf of it will be filled with such shining scum. Orators and writers\r\naddicted to such whims should be indicted for murdering the Queen's\r\nIrish.\r\n\r\nThe prime cause of Ireland's misery is the oppressive rule of England.\r\nFor centuries she has been governed by and for the alien few, and not by\r\nand for the native many. England first wantonly subdued Ireland; then\r\nplanted there an alien race and a rival church, to hate, worry, and\r\nplunder her; then, by the Catholic Penal Code, steeped her in ignorance\r\nand debasement; and finally, by bribery, and against the national will,\r\nabolished her Parliament, destroyed her nationality, and reduced her to\r\nthe condition of a dependent province. Since the days of Cromwell, the\r\nruling English have absorbed the wealth of the country, and carried it\r\naway to be expended in other lands. They have annually eaten out the\r\nsubstance of the people, and fled, leaving misery and poverty behind,\r\nand casting reproach upon the national character, and offering insult to\r\nthe national spirit.\r\n\r\nSince the Union, the legislation of the British Parliament, in respect\r\nto Ireland, has been an almost unbroken series of insults and injuries.\r\nI will mention two instances; and they are the very two that England\r\nalways cites as proofs of her liberality. In 1828-9, the people of\r\nIreland demanded Catholic Emancipation. The boon was granted; but it was\r\naccompanied by the disfranchisement of the whole body of forty-shilling\r\nfreeholders; thus, in revenge, striking from the electoral body two\r\nhundred thousand names, which had aided in wringing the gift from the\r\noppressor. Emancipation, granted on such ungracious terms, exasperated\r\nrather than appeased the Irish people. And in that other day, when\r\nEngland felt peculiarly liberal, and was ready to \"give everything to\r\neverybody,\" she made Ireland an exception. The Reform bill made an\r\nodious distinction in the case of Ireland. England and Wales, with a\r\npopulation of about fourteen millions, were allowed 500 members of the\r\nHouse of Commons. Ireland, with a population of about eight millions,\r\nwas allowed but 105. Bearing the same ratio as England, Ireland should\r\nhave had 290. Scotland has two millions four hundred thousand\r\ninhabitants, and 53 members. In the same proportion, Ireland would have\r\nbeen entitled to 177. Thus, of the two most benign instances of English\r\nlegislation over Ireland, during this century, one was accompanied by a\r\npositive outrage; the other by a most unjust disparagement.\r\n\r\nThe Established Church of England, planted by force in Ireland, has done\r\nlittle for it, except to unjustly tax and cruelly treat those who\r\ndissent from its ritual, and to foment and aggravate religious feuds. Of\r\nthe eight millions of Ireland, six and a half are Catholics. Of the\r\nremaining one and a half million, not half a million belong to the\r\nEstablishment. And yet, to take care of this half million, the\r\nEstablishment has had 4 archbishops, 18 bishops, and 2,000\r\nclergy--drawing annually from this potato-eating people L1,500,000;\r\nwhile the income of the clergy of the seven and a half millions of all\r\ndenominations has not exceeded L500,000. The whole income of the Irish\r\nEstablishment, from all sources of revenue, is nearly L2,000,000\r\nannually. An attempt was once made to modify this enormous abuse. After\r\nfour years of contention in Parliament, during which two ministries were\r\nturned out, the bill was shorn of its effective features, in order to\r\npacify the Tory peers, and passed, still leaving the revenues to the\r\nChurch of England, and the people to the Church of Rome.\r\n\r\nBut the English Church is only a blotch. The great sore is the Irish\r\nlandlord system. The misgovernment of the country has conspired with\r\nlandlordism to drive out capital, and destroy commerce, trade, mining,\r\nfishing, and manufacturing, thus throwing the mass of the population\r\nupon the land for subsistence. This has increased competition for the\r\nhire of the soil to an extent unknown in any other country, and has\r\nstimulated a grinding scale of rents, which has descended from the\r\nlandlords to the middlemen, and from them to the small farmers, and from\r\nthem to the poor laborers, growing more extortionate as it goes down,\r\ntill the soil has been cut into minute pieces, which are held by short\r\nand uncertain tenures, precluding permanent improvements, driving the\r\nmass of the people to the raising of potatoes, because they are cheap in\r\nthe cultivation, and prolific in the crop, and yearly turning thousands\r\nout to beg, starve, rob, die of disease, or shoot their lessors at the\r\nexpiration of their terms. One-third of the people of Ireland live (if\r\nthey live at all) on potatoes, and the addition of a sprinkling of salt\r\nis a rare luxury. Two and a half millions are beggars, and Mr. O'Connell\r\nestimated the paupers in 1846-7 (the years of famine) at four millions.\r\nThe main reliance of nearly half the nation, for food, is potatoes. God\r\nhave mercy on them when that source fails!\r\n\r\nWith many noble exceptions, the large landed proprietors of Ireland are\r\nheartless, reckless, thriftless men. Nearly one-third of the country is\r\na bog, three-fourths of which might be drained. Nearly five millions of\r\nacres, capable of cultivation, lie waste. An acre of potato land rents\r\nfor from L5 to L10 per annum. Labor is abundant at the lowest rates. Yet\r\nthese landlords have done little toward draining these bogs, enclosing\r\nthese wastes, and improving their estates. Grant that for the four or\r\nfive past years of pinching famine, attended with loss of rents, they\r\nhave been unable to make improvements. It was just so before these years\r\ncame, and has been so time out of mind. These landlords are generally\r\n_absentee_ proprietors, who feel no abiding interest in the prosperity\r\nof a soil which they forage but do not inhabit, which they own but do\r\nnot occupy. Half of the very money voted to them in 1846-7, by\r\nParliament, for the improvement of Ireland, they spent the next season\r\nat Paris, Florence, and Baden-Baden, there to swell the pomp of British\r\naristocracy, while millions at home, whom it was intended to assist, ate\r\ngarbage that an English pig would hardly nose over, or starved in hovels\r\nthat the royal stag-hounds would not skulk into from a pelting storm.\r\n\r\nThe energies of the masses in Ireland being absorbed in a hand-to-mouth\r\nstruggle for existence, they have neither time nor means to stimulate\r\nthe industry of the country by establishing manufactories, opening\r\nmines, carrying on fisheries, increasing trade, laying out roads, &c.,\r\nnor to elevate and expand the national mind by founding common schools\r\nand seminaries of learning. The wealthy landlords and capitalists--the\r\nBesboroughs, the Lansdownes, the Devons, the Fitzwilliams, the\r\nHertfords--who might do all this, will not; but, looking on from afar,\r\ncry to their stewards and agents, \"Give! Give! Give!\"\r\n\r\nThe result of this complicated system of bad government and bad\r\nmanagement is painfully obvious. Ireland is nigh unto death of a chronic\r\ndisease of famine, pestilence, agitation, despair, and insurrection.\r\n\r\nAnd what is England's remedial process for this disease in one of her\r\nmembers? As a panacea for the miseries that she herself has to a great\r\nextent inflicted, England, at stated periods, administers to her\r\nvictim-patient coercion bills and cold steel, blotching her surface with\r\npolice stations and military camps. Sending her tax-gatherers instead of\r\nschoolmasters, dotting her soil with cathedrals instead of workshops,\r\nsowing her fields with gunpowder instead of grain, England affects to\r\nwonder that the crop should be famine and faction, misery and murder,\r\nimprovidence and insurrection; and when the harvest is dead ripe, she\r\nsends over police and soldiery, armed with coercion bills and cannon\r\nballs, to cut and gather it in.\r\n\r\nSometimes England varies the prescription, or makes different\r\napplications to various parts of the body politic. Sir Robert Peel, for\r\ninstance, prescribes bullets for Repealers, and guineas to a cloister of\r\npriests at Maynooth, to stop the mouths of the latter and the wind of\r\nthe former, and the clamor of both. Then comes Lord John Russell with\r\nthe Whig nostrum--money to carry the landlords to Baden, and a steamer\r\nto transport Mitchell to Bermuda--projects of railways to furnish hard\r\nwork for laborers and fat jobs for contractors--a patch or two on a\r\nworn-out and inefficient poor-law, and packed juries for O'Brien and\r\nMeagher. So these Tory and Whig quacks administer--inflicting wounds\r\nand doling out palliatives--never probing the ulcer, but striving to\r\nskim over its surface--while there stands John Bull, robbing the naked\r\nand half-dead patient, at the same time affecting to do penance, by\r\npaying the doctors, and giving alms to the victim.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the remedy for these evils? Having been very imperfect in\r\ndetailing their causes, I must be equally imperfect in pointing out\r\nremedies. Looking on from afar, it seems to me that some of the things\r\nthat Ireland needs are these:\r\n\r\nAnd first, as to a few temporary measures. Ireland needs a just and\r\nbeneficent poor law. The present law is a mockery and a shame. The\r\nprinciple of the law should be, that every man who wishes for work shall\r\nhave it, or be fed by the poor rates. Government owes bread or work to\r\nall its subjects. The rates should be mainly laid on the land, where\r\n_it_ is able to pay them, even if it be by sale under the hammer. This\r\ndone, those landlords who apply to Parliament for money on which to live\r\nin improvidence, and in many instances in extravagance, would feel the\r\npressure, awake to a consciousness of their condition, and, knowing that\r\nif they did not provide the laboring poor with work, they must furnish\r\nthem with food, would either abandon their estates, or commence draining\r\nand planting the bogs and wastes. In either case, the laborer, for whose\r\nuse God said, \"Let the dry land appear!\" would be restored to his\r\ninheritance.\r\n\r\nThe mass cannot wait for the meager relief of poor laws. Tens of\r\nthousands must emigrate by their own means or Government aid. The\r\ncountry is too densely populated for the present state of things.\r\nAmerica should open wide her gates, to welcome the sons and brothers of\r\nthose who have fought our battles, dug our canals, and built our\r\nrailways, and, pointing to the unoccupied plains that stretch from the\r\ngreat lakes to Astoria, from the Rocky Mountains to San Francisco, say,\r\n\"Go in and possess the land.\"\r\n\r\nAssociations should be formed, of true-hearted Irishmen, to reclaim the\r\nwastes, develop the resources, and revive the industry of the\r\ncountry--thus giving scope to capital and employment to labor.\r\n\r\nThe middle and lower classes should be more provident and careful, less\r\nwasteful and indolent, using thriftily the little they have, and adding\r\nto the stock by economy and enterprise. After traveling through half the\r\nisland, I never was able to understand why a middling-man should waste\r\nhis substance in riotous living, or a poor man should live in a hovel\r\ndirtier than a pig-sty, when pure water was abundant; or year after year\r\nlet the rain drive through his thatched roof, when straw was rotting\r\naround him, merely because England would not grant a repeal of the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nThe ignorant should, of course, be educated. But general education, it\r\nis to be feared, is a long way off. In the mean time, the better\r\ninformed should instruct the people in their social duties, as well as\r\ntheir political rights, while such as are not utterly debased should\r\nexhibit more personal independence in opinion and action, do less of\r\ntheir thinking by proxy, show less subserviency to priests of all sorts,\r\nand less tolerance of demagogues of every shade of party.\r\n\r\nBut these things are only provisional remedies--mere clippings of the\r\nbranches. The axe should be hurled at the root of the evil.\r\n\r\nThe Established Church should be driven out, and, if need be, by a whip\r\nof small cords, such as was applied to those money-changers in the\r\nTemple, who had set up their _desks_ where they had no business to be.\r\nThis done, complete ecclesiastical independence, both of England and of\r\nRome, both of the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Pope of St. Peter's,\r\nshould be declared, bringing with it less servility among the clergy,\r\nless abjectness among the people, less gathering in of parochial tithes,\r\nand a more liberal diffusion of Christian charity. In a word, less\r\n\"religion,\" and more Christianity.\r\n\r\nThe landlord system should be broken up; all taints of feudalism\r\nabolished; primogeniture and entail destroyed; and traffic in the soil\r\nbe made as free as in the potatoes it yields. \"Ireland for the Irish,\"\r\nwas the watchword of Daniel O'Connell; and when translated \"The Land of\r\nIreland for the People of Ireland,\" it is just and equitable.\r\n\"Absenteeism\" should be no longer tolerated. To strip foreign landlords\r\nof soil that they will neither cultivate nor sell, is justifiable on\r\nevery principle of property and Christianity. Every farm in America is\r\nheld by a title based on the doctrine that land is given to man to be\r\noccupied and cultivated, not wandered over and made a waste. We\r\ndisplaced the aboriginal hunters on this principle, and inclosed farms\r\nand built cities. The means used to effect this were often nefarious;\r\nthe object sought was righteous. The landlords of Ireland, in regard to\r\none-third of the soil, neither cultivate nor occupy it; and such is the\r\ndire necessity of the case, that the Government would be justified in\r\ntaking the land from every such owner, and giving it to the people, so\r\nthat it might bring forth its natural increase of bread to the sower.\r\nEvery man owning land in Ireland, who prefers to live in England, and\r\nhabitually lets the soil lie waste, or, being cultivated, draws the\r\nsubstance from it to be expended abroad in extravagance, should be\r\ncompelled to restore it to the people of Ireland, to be used, not for\r\npurposes of luxury, but to save the dwellers thereon from starvation.\r\nThis is not confiscation, but restoration. Famine-stricken Ireland, and\r\nnot full-fed English aristocracy, is the owner of the soil of Ireland.\r\nThe great mass of these alien proprietors hold their lands by titles\r\nderived from wholesale confiscation. Cromwell and other English rulers\r\ntook them by force from the native, and gave them to the foreigner.\r\nForce, if need be, should compel their restoration. Property in the soil\r\nhas its duties to discharge, as well as its rights to enjoy; and if it\r\nwillfully refuse to discharge the former, then it should not be allowed\r\nto enjoy the latter. The people of Ireland have a God-given right to\r\nlive upon and by the soil on which His Providence has planted their\r\nfeet. Coercion bills _may_ be necessary for Ireland. If they be, they\r\nshould be impartially enforced on both landlords and tenants, compelling\r\neach to discharge their respective duties. If the owners of Irish\r\nestates are incapable of learning that property has its obligations as\r\nwell as its immunities, they should be made to give place to more\r\ntractable scholars.\r\n\r\nAnd finally: more than all this, and including it all, IRELAND SHOULD\r\nGOVERN IRELAND. This is the tender point in this much vexed and most\r\nvexatious \"Irish Question.\" England has never brought her unbiased\r\njudgment to its investigation. The truth simply is, John Bull dare not\r\nlook it steadily in the face. He knows he has no more right to govern\r\nIreland than he has to govern Pennsylvania--no more right to govern it\r\nin the way he has since the Union, than to put its every man, woman, and\r\nchild, to the sword. Conceived in sin and brought forth in iniquity, his\r\ngovernment of that people has been one series of crimes and blunders. It\r\nwas sheer usurpation in the beginning, and neither time nor the mode of\r\nits administration has changed its character. Three-fourths of the\r\ngenuine, unadulterated Irish desire a separation from England. But\r\nEngland refuses to relinquish its grasp. It pleads in extenuation of its\r\nhold on the national throat, that Ireland is incapable of governing\r\nitself. This may be. But it is evident that England is incompetent to\r\nthe task. Ireland could hardly do worse for itself than England has done\r\nfor it. It should be permitted to try an experiment which, in England's\r\nhands, has proved a sad failure. Let England give Ireland the rope, and,\r\nif she hang herself, it will at least be suicide, and not murder. If\r\nfree Ireland continued to shiver in bog cabins, and feed on saltless\r\npotatoes, she would at least gratify that inherent principle in human\r\nnature, which makes the beggar prefer to freeze and starve in his own\r\nchosen way, rather than on compulsion. But no such doom awaits\r\nemancipated Ireland. A government, based on democratic foundations,\r\nspringing from and responsible to the people, would be a government for\r\nthe people. Cast off British rule, drive out the Church Establishment,\r\nextirpate the landlord system, give Ireland to the Irish, throw them\r\nupon their own ample physical and mental resources--thus creating for\r\nthem a new world, and a new race to people it--and who can estimate the\r\nupward spring of the national energies?\r\n\r\nBut, will Ireland ever obtain independence? Will she ever become a\r\nnation? Will Emmett's epitaph ever be written? Did England ever\r\nrelinquish her hold upon a rod of bog or an acre of sand, except at the\r\npoint of the bayonet? By voluntarily restoring independence to Ireland,\r\ndare she set an example that would bring Canada, Hindostan, and all her\r\ncolonies and \"Keys\" in the uttermost parts of the earth to her doors,\r\nasking, yea, demanding, like restitution? And must Ireland draw the\r\nsword, or submit? Ah! must she draw the sword _and_ submit? England will\r\nnever dare to give freedom to Ireland, till she dare not refuse.\r\nCommotions in her own bosom, that shall blanch her cheek, and make her\r\nknees smite together, may bring Ireland's \"opportunity.\" If she should,\r\nin that hour, smite her chains, would not the blow quicken the pulses of\r\nevery free heart in the world? \"There is no sufficient cause to justify\r\na revolution,\" says some coward or conservative. The case of George\r\nWashington _vs._ George Guelph, decided that question, wherein it was\r\nruled by the whole Court, that \"Resistance to tyrants is obedience to\r\nGod.\" The stamp act? It was the little finger to the loins. England, by\r\na thousand acts, has stamped the life out of eight millions of people.\r\nBut, unless light beams from unexpected quarters, there is not a shadow\r\nof hope of successful resistance to British oppression for years to\r\ncome. If Ireland were three thousand miles away, she could break her\r\nchains with one united blow. But the shadow of her towering conqueror\r\ncrosses the narrow channel, and fills her with awe. And worse than all,\r\nher councils, which should breathe only the spirit of harmony, are rent\r\nwith domestic feuds. No true son of the land of Hancock and of Henry\r\nblames O'Brien, Meagher, and the \"rebels\" of Forty-Eight, for striking a\r\nblow for their country's independence. The hour was unpropitious. The\r\npreparation was defective. The means were wholly inadequate to the end.\r\nBut, the motive which inspired the deed was noble. Whether the graves of\r\nthese patriotic men be made at the foot of an Irish scaffold, or on the\r\nsoil of a penal colony, regenerated Ireland will seek out their\r\nresting-places, and her grateful tears\r\n\r\n  \"Shall sprinkle the cold dust in which they sleep\r\n  Pompless, and from a scornful world withdrawn;\r\n  The laurel which its malice rent shall shoot,\r\n  So watered, into life, and mantling shower\r\n  Its verdant honors o'er their grassy tombs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\n     Life, Services, and Character of Daniel O'Connell.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery page of Ireland's history during the present century bears the\r\nname of DANIEL O'CONNELL. In many important respects he is the greatest\r\nof Irishmen. He occupied a first place among the persons who have\r\nrecently figured in European affairs, and was one of the most celebrated\r\norators of our times. For the last twenty years, few men exerted so\r\npowerful an influence on the politics of Great Britain, while his sway\r\nover his immediate countrymen has probably never been equaled. His death\r\nproduced a profound sensation in two hemispheres. Though his character,\r\nlike that of all men who leave a deep impress on their age, has been\r\nvariously estimated by those who, on the one hand, received his warm\r\nsympathy and powerful support, or, on the other, encountered his fierce\r\nreprobation and vigorous opposition, yet all classes of friends and foes\r\nconcurred in the sentiment that a master spirit had ceased to influence\r\nhuman affairs.\r\n\r\nMr. O'Connell was admitted to the Dublin bar at a time when Curran, one\r\nof the most witty, graceful, and brilliant advocates that ever swayed a\r\njury, and Plunkett, one of the most eloquent lawyers that ever addressed\r\na bench, were in the zenith of their fame. It is sufficient proof of the\r\nability and skill of young O'Connell to say, that he had been at the bar\r\nbut a year or two before he was surrounded by a large circle of clients,\r\nand had won victories over each of the eminent barristers I have named.\r\nBut it was not possible for a mind composed of such fervid elements as\r\nhis, to be confined within the purlieus of the courts, looking after the\r\nminor interests of John Doe and Richard Roe; and it soon became evident\r\nthat he was to mingle with the sober duties of the lawyer the more\r\nexciting and less profitable toils of the politician. He came to the bar\r\nat one of the most memorable periods of Irish history--the year\r\nNinety-Eight--when the \"United Irishmen\" struck an unsuccessful blow for\r\nthe independence of their country. The leaders of the rebellion were\r\narrested for high treason. The life-blood of the chivalrous Robert Emmet\r\nwas poured out on the scaffold. Several of his compatriots, after\r\nsuffering cruel imprisonments, and wandering, as exiles, through Europe,\r\nreached America, where they were received with open arms by the friends\r\nof freedom. Among these, were Thomas Addis Emmet, the eloquent Attorney\r\nGeneral of New York; Counselor Sampson, one of the acutest lawyers and\r\nkeenest wits that ever excoriated a brother advocate at the bar of New\r\nYork, and whose father, a dissenting minister, was hanged as a rebel;\r\nand Dr. Macneven, who rose to eminence in the medical profession in that\r\ncity. The rebellion of Ninety-Eight resulted in the legislative union\r\nbetween Great Britain and Ireland. Against this measure Mr. O'Connell,\r\nin company with a majority of his countrymen, uttered a solemn protest.\r\nHis first political speech was made in opposition to the proposed act,\r\nthe repeal of which occupied so prominent a place in the efforts of his\r\ndeclining years. This speech, pronounced before the congregated\r\nthousands of Dublin, is said not to have been surpassed for power of\r\nargument, severity of invective, and splendor of declamation, by any of\r\nhis later displays on the same subject. His young soul welled up from\r\nfull fountains as he portrayed this final degradation which England was\r\nabout to inflict upon Ireland; and when the deed was done, and he saw\r\nthe emblems of national independence borne away by the conqueror,\r\nHannibal-like, he swore eternal hostility to the oppressor. And most\r\nreligiously did he perform his vow!\r\n\r\nMr. O'Connell now turned his attention to the civil and ecclesiastical\r\ndisabilities of the Roman Catholics of the kingdom. Of the extent of his\r\nservices in procuring their removal, I have spoken in another place. To\r\nthis work he gave up twenty-five of the prime years of his life. To him,\r\nnot the Catholics only, but the Dissenters of every name in Great\r\nBritain, are much indebted for the enlargement of their privileges\r\nduring the last thirty years. This endeared him to large bodies of\r\nChristian men, who widely differed from him in religious opinion, giving\r\nhim a strong hold, Catholic and agitator though he was, upon liberal\r\nBaptists, Congregationalists, and Quakers, who, while repudiating his\r\ncreed, cherished the principle of toleration for which he contended. Mr.\r\nO'Connell regarded Catholic Emancipation as the great achievement of his\r\nlife; and it was that which won for him the title of \"The Liberator of\r\nIreland.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the Catholic controversy, of the bitterness of which Americans\r\ncan scarcely conceive, Mr. O'Connell for once departed from the pacific\r\npolicy which was the guiding principle of his excited life. Dublin was\r\nthe central heart whence he sent out agitating pulsations through every\r\nartery of the Irish body. The corporation of that city was a high Tory\r\nmunicipality, of the most bigoted and vindictive class. The leader of\r\nthe Emancipationists was often in collision with its members, many of\r\nwhom encountered his severest attacks. In 1815, Mr. D'Esterre, a member\r\nof the corporation, at the instigation of its leading officers,\r\nchallenged Mr. O'Connell to personal combat. The parties met, and at the\r\nfirst fire D'Esterre fell, mortally wounded. The successful duelist saw\r\nhis antagonist stretched on the grass at his feet, gasping in death. The\r\nawful spectacle left an abiding abhorrence of blood on the sensitive\r\nmind of O'Connell. Twenty-five years later he inscribed on the Repeal\r\nbanner his memorable saying, \"No political change is worth the shedding\r\nof one drop of human blood.\" His remorse for the D'Esterre tragedy\r\nbrought forth fruits meet for repentance. During their lives he\r\ncontributed liberally to the support of the widow and children of the\r\nman whom he had slain.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Grattan, Ireland had no champion in the British\r\nSenate, to give utterance to the emotions that swelled her full heart.\r\nThe Emancipation Act of 1829 opened the doors of the House of Commons to\r\nMr. O'Connell. Born and cradled in Ireland, he had grown up with her\r\npeople, an Irishman of the Irishmen. He landed on the eastern shore of\r\nSt. George's Channel the same man as when the spires of Dublin faded\r\nfrom his eye in the western horizon. He carried with him a name endeared\r\nin every cabin from Coleraine to Cork, and familiar to statesmen in\r\nEngland and throughout Europe. Widely as he was known, he was known only\r\nas an Irishman; and his reputation was, in its kind, purely Irish. To\r\nhis dying day, he gloried in the epithet early bestowed upon him in\r\nParliament, and which, though intended as a reproach, he converted into\r\na talisman--\"The member for all Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nA new field was now opened before him. Grattan, alluding to Flood's\r\nfailure in the English Parliament, said: \"An oak of the forest is too\r\nold to be transplanted at fifty.\" Though O'Connell was fifty-four when\r\nhe entered that body, his parliamentary career, covering eighteen years,\r\nwas of the most sturdy growth. His speeches in support of the Reform\r\nBill rank with the ablest which that controversy called forth. He threw\r\nhis soul into the cause of Negro Emancipation, fighting side by side, in\r\nand out of Parliament, with Wilberforce, Clarkson, Buxton, Brougham,\r\nLushington, till the slave became a man. He early embraced the doctrine\r\nof immediate and unconditional emancipation, and was among the few\r\nmembers who voted against the delusive scheme of apprenticeship. He\r\nunited with Sturge, Wardlaw, and Scoble, in the subsequent movement that\r\nrestored to the apprentices the full rights of British subjects. At the\r\noutset of the enterprise, he gave his voice and vote in favor of the\r\nleading principles of the Chartists, and was among the earliest\r\nadvocates of Rowland Hill's plan of cheap postage. He joined George\r\nThompson in portraying the wrongs of British India and denouncing the\r\ncrimes of its oppressors, and was an able supporter of the doctrines and\r\nmeasures of the Anti-Corn-Law League.\r\n\r\nThe member for all Ireland gave a large share of his thoughts to\r\nIrish affairs. Regarding the abolition of the Irish Parliament as one of\r\nthe chief sources of the national suffering, he consecrated the last\r\nten years of his life to efforts for the Repeal of the Union. The\r\nmeans employed were the same as those by which he obtained\r\nEmancipation--Popular Agitation. The Repeal excitement, which was\r\nsoothed for a time by the conciliatory course of the Melbourne\r\nGovernment, broke out with increased intensity when Sir Robert Peel rose\r\nto power in 1841-2. In the latter year, \"Repeal!\" resounded from every\r\nparish in the island. The next year saw the \"Monster Meetings,\" when the\r\nassembled populace, which swayed to the inspiring eloquence of the\r\nLiberator, was measured by acres. The Government was alarmed. Just\r\nprevious to a grand demonstration at Clontarf, O'Connell, and five\r\nothers, were arrested for conspiring to change the laws of the realm by\r\nintimidation. The trials, which consumed nearly the whole of January,\r\n1844, resulted in the conviction of most of the defendants. O'Connell,\r\nwhen brought up for sentence, pronounced an able and dignified protest\r\nagainst the proceedings. He was adjudged to pay a fine of L2,000, be\r\nimprisoned one year, and give sureties to keep the peace for seven. He\r\nbrought a writ of error to the House of Lords. In the mean time he was\r\nsent to the Richmond Penitentiary. The Lords reversed the judgment.\r\nAfter spending three months in a prison, where his \"cell\" was fitted up\r\nand filled like the presence-chamber of a king, and his \"confinement\"\r\nconsisted in walking among arbors and parterres that \"a Shenstone might\r\nhave envied,\" he was released, and, mounted on a triumphal car, rode in\r\nstate to his residence in Dublin, attended by uncounted thousands of his\r\nshouting countrymen. In the frenzy of its joy, Conciliation Hall\r\ndeclared that \"The Liberator had driven the car of Repeal through the\r\nMonster Indictment.\"\r\n\r\nDarker skies were gathering over O'Connell. The pacific tenor of his\r\nagitations had thwarted the government. The magic of his name had\r\nprevented any overt act of violence by vast assemblies of his excited\r\ncountrymen. The sub-leaders became impatient of delay, assumed a defiant\r\ntone, and demanded that the non-resistant doctrines of O'Connell be\r\nrepudiated by the National Repeal Association. Then arose \"Young\r\nIreland.\" Then came strife and division, one party clinging to, the\r\nother separating from, the great leader. The alienation of large numbers\r\nof his friends overtaking him when his powers were impaired by years of\r\nexhausting toil, broke the spirit of the old man, undermined his\r\nconstitution, and compelled him to repair to the Continent to\r\nresuscitate his waning health and drooping heart. But he left the field\r\nof exertion too late. His energies rapidly declined; death overtook him\r\nwhile on his weary pilgrimage; his eye saw the sun for the last time in\r\na foreign sky; and he slept his final sleep far from the land which gave\r\nhim birth, and from that ocean by whose side his cradle was rocked. The\r\nstroke that felled him to the earth sent a pang through many a heart in\r\nevery country where humanity has a dwelling-place; for his sympathies,\r\nlike his reputation, were world-wide. He had delivered his own\r\ncountrymen from the bonds of ecclesiastical tyranny, and had plead for\r\nthe victims of a hellish traffic on the shores of Africa, for the\r\nswarthy serfs of British cupidity on the banks of the Ganges, for the\r\npersecuted Jews of ancient Damascus, and for the stricken slaves in the\r\nisles of the Caribbean Sea and in the distant States of America.\r\n\r\nNo impartial and well-informed mind doubts the sincerity of Mr.\r\nO'Connell in demanding a Repeal of the Union. But it is equally\r\nunquestionable that, in his estimate of the benefits to flow from that\r\nmeasure, he either was deceived himself, or misled his followers.\r\nProbably long contemplation of that object, as the one remedy for the\r\nills of Ireland, betrayed him into the errors of all disciples of\r\n\"one-ideaism,\" while he was not exempt from the common infirmity of\r\npolitical leaders, in unduly magnifying before the eye of their\r\npartisans _the_ measure of the party. Ineffectual as Repeal must have\r\nproved in producing a radical cure for Ireland, it would have been a\r\npreliminary stage in her restoration to complete independence, and\r\ntherefore was important.\r\n\r\nIn respect to Mr. O'Connell's general course as a public man, it may be\r\nsaid that he did not belong to the ascetic school of politicians. He was\r\nnot exempt from trick and artifice in attaining his ends, and was lavish\r\nin promising to do for his followers what he must have known he could\r\nnot perform. Indeed, he was something of a demagogue. In honesty of\r\npurpose, he ranks with the better class of great public leaders; and if\r\nthis be not saying much, it is saying more than can be uttered of the\r\nbody. He is a rare man who is worthy to be ranked among the exceptions\r\nto bad general rules. The objects to which he devoted his political life\r\nwere the noblest that can move the hearts of men. He that has never\r\nemployed questionable means to secure even such ends may cast the first\r\nstone at Daniel O'Connell.\r\n\r\nIt only remains that I refer to his personal, social, and mental\r\ncharacteristics. Mr. O'Connell had a massive frame, capable of enduring\r\ngreat fatigue, and he was one of the most industrious and laborious of\r\nmen. His manners were cordial and frank; his social qualities genial and\r\nwinning; and he was singularly affectionate as a husband and a father.\r\nIt was only in the fierce conflicts of partisan strife, when challenged\r\nby some strong provocation, that the unlovely and almost vindictive\r\ntraits of his nature were displayed. Then, the man who, an hour before,\r\nhad been all gentleness and good humor--caressing his grandchildren with\r\nwomanly fervor, or, in his seat in the Commons, affectionately holding\r\nthe hand of his son for a half hour together--now opened that terrible\r\nbattery of invective which he so well knew how to employ, and covered\r\nhis foe with a storm of fire.\r\n\r\nHe possessed a mind of uncommon native vigor, trained by a complete\r\neducation, and enlarged with a knowledge of men and things varied and\r\nample. The versatility of his genius, his extensive information, and his\r\ncapacity to adapt himself to the matter under discussion or the audience\r\nbefore him, were surprising. I have heard him exhaust topics that\r\nrequired for their elucidation an intimate acquaintance with the\r\nConstitution of the United States, with the condition of barbarous\r\ntribes in the interior of Africa, with the wrongs inflicted by the East\r\nIndia Company upon the dwellers in Hindostan, with the commercial\r\ntariffs of European nations, with the persecution of the Jews in Asia,\r\nwith the causes of the opium war in China, with the relative rights of\r\nplanters and laborers in the Western Archipelago--and he was at home in\r\neach. I have seen him hold the House of Commons spell-bound, call shouts\r\nfrom the _elite_ of British intelligence and philanthropy in Exeter\r\nHall, lash into fury or hush into repose acres of wild peasantry\r\ngathered on the moors of Ireland--and he was at home with each.\r\n\r\nAs a popular orator, before mixed assemblies, our age has rarely seen\r\nhis equal. So good a judge as John Randolph pronounced him the first\r\norator in Europe. Every chord of the human bosom lay open to his touch,\r\nand he played upon its passions and emotions with a master's hand. He\r\ncould subdue his hearers to tears by his pathos, or toss them with\r\nlaughter by his humor. His imagination could bear them to a giddy hight\r\non its elastic wing, or he could enchain their judgment by the strong\r\nlinks of his logic. He could blanch their cheek as he painted before\r\ntheir eye some atrocity red with blood, or he could make them hold their\r\nsides as he related some broad Irish anecdote fresh from Cork. He used\r\nto say he was the bes-tabused man in Europe. But he was able to\r\nliquidate all such scores with most usurious interest. He could\r\nexcoriate an antagonist with invective, or roast him alive before a slow\r\nfire of sarcasm. When his indignation was fully roused, he boiled like a\r\nvolcano; yet there was no excess of action or noise, but an eruption\r\nwhose lava consumed all before it. His recital of facts charmed like a\r\nromance, and his appeals to the sympathies, uttered in a musical voice\r\nand the richest brogue of his native island, were tender and subduing.\r\n\r\nNo actor ever excelled him in reflecting the workings of the mind\r\nthrough the windows of the countenance. He _looked_ every sentiment as\r\nit fell from his lips. I have seen a deputation of Hindoo chiefs, while\r\nlistening to his detail, before an assembly, of the wrongs of India,\r\nnever take their eyes off of him for an hour and a half, though not one\r\nword in ten was intelligible to their ears. His gesticulation was\r\nredundant, never commonplace, strictly _sui generis_, far from being\r\nawkward, not precisely graceful, and yet it could hardly have been more\r\nforcible, and, so to speak, illustrative. He threw himself into a great\r\nvariety of attitudes, all evidently unpremeditated. Now he stands bolt\r\nupright like a grenadier. Then he assumes the port and bearing of a\r\npugilist. Now he folds his arms upon his breast, utters some beautiful\r\nsentiment, relaxes them, recedes a step, and gives wing to the\r\ncoruscations of his fancy, while a winning smile plays over his\r\ncountenance. Then he \"stands at ease,\" and relates an anecdote with the\r\nrollicking air of a horse-jockey at Donnybrook Fair. Quick as thought,\r\nhis indignation is kindled; and, before speaking a word, he makes a\r\nviolent sweep with his arm, seizes his wig as if he would tear it in\r\npieces, adjusts it to its place, advances to the front of the rostrum,\r\nthrows his body into the attitude of a gladiator, and pours out a flood\r\nof rebuke and denunciation.\r\n\r\nLike most other rare men who have acted conspicuous parts in turbulent\r\ntimes, he had great faults, eminent virtues, crowds of enemies, troops\r\nof friends. His flatterers have rarely called him a statesman. In truth,\r\nhe was neither a good statesman, nor a bad statesman, but simply a bold\r\nand generally successful political agitator. He grappled with questions\r\nthat shook empires; led the van in many a contest against despotism; was\r\nindebted in no small degree for his victories to the rottenness of the\r\ninstitutions he assailed. All right-minded and liberal-hearted men will\r\nascribe his defects partly to the evil times in which he lived, partly\r\nto a hasty temper and an indomitable pride of opinion, while to a large\r\nextent they will be attributed to a generous and impulsive nature,\r\nimpatient of unmeasured abuse and unreasonable opposition. Impartial\r\nhistory will record that his fury was usually poured out on the heads of\r\nmeanness, fraud, injustice, and oppression; that he was the friend, the\r\nchampion, the brother, of depressed and outraged manhood, irrespective\r\nof clime, color, or creed; and that wherever Humanity writhed under the\r\nheel of Tyranny, there were found the glowing heart and trumpet voice of\r\nDaniel O'Connell, sympathizing with the victim and rebuking the tyrant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n     The Temperance Reformation--Father Mathew.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Temperance Reformation in Ireland, one of the most surprising moral\r\nphenomena of this century, is attributable, under Providence, to the\r\nzealous and discreet labors of one man.\r\n\r\nThe 10th of April, 1838, begun a new era in this philanthropic\r\nenterprise. On that day, Rev. THEOBALD MATHEW signed the pledge, took\r\nthe lead of the Cork Temperance Society, and entered upon those labors\r\nwhich have sent his fame over the earth like sunshine. For a year\r\nafterward he held semi-weekly meetings in Cork, for administering the\r\npledge to the people. Feeble in its beginnings, the popular feeling\r\ngradually rose in favor of the movement, his meetings were crowded to\r\noverflowing, his house was besieged night and day, the roads leading to\r\nCork were, on \"pledge days,\" thronged with multitudes, eager to take the\r\nvow from the lips of \"the good Father;\" and at the close of the year,\r\nthe number of names enrolled exceeded 150,000.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the reverential element, which constitutes so prominent a trait\r\nin the Irish character, contributed to the early success of Father\r\nMathew. A priest and a friar, respected for his purity of life,\r\nremarkable for the winning simplicity and kindness of his manners,\r\nsolemnly pronouncing the pledge to a convert, kneeling devoutly at his\r\nfeet, and he, in the presence of listening thousands, repeating the vow\r\nas it fell from the lips of his spiritual teacher, and receiving a medal\r\nas a token of his plighted faith, and rising from the ground while the\r\nFather pronounced the benediction, \"May God bless you, my son, and help\r\nyou to keep your promise,\" was adapted to sink into the soul of even a\r\nless susceptible people than the Irish.\r\n\r\nNear the close of the year 1839, Mr. Mathew visited Limerick, and was\r\ngreeted by such an outburst of popular feeling as has not been equaled\r\nexcept by some of the Monster Repeal Meetings of O'Connell. Every street\r\nand lane of the city exhibited a dense mass of human beings. When the\r\n\"Apostle of Temperance\" arrived, a shout went up that was heard for\r\nmiles around. Provisions rose on that day three-fold, and at night,\r\nthough every house, hall, and cellar even, was filled, thousands upon\r\nthousands were unable to find a lodging or a shelter, and were compelled\r\nto shiver in the open streets till morning. He remained four or five\r\ndays in Limerick. At one time, and in one street, 20,000 persons might\r\nbe seen kneeling to receive the pledge, after which they arose and\r\nretired in order, and made room for other thousands. The thrilling\r\nshouts, as Father Mathew moved from place to place, the serried ranks of\r\nkneeling recipients, the solemn stillness that prevailed while the\r\npledge was given, the press of eager thousands to fill the places of\r\nthose who withdrew, were scenes that bankrupt description. The number of\r\npersons who took the pledge at this time in Limerick was upwards of\r\n150,000. Leaving Limerick, he visited Waterford, and administered it to\r\n60,000. In the spring of 1840, he repaired to Dublin, which rose _en\r\nmasse_ to receive him, while the neighboring counties sent their\r\nthousands to the city to take the pledge and obtain his blessing.\r\n\r\nDuring the succeeding three years, he visited all parts of Ireland,\r\ngrateful shouts everywhere heralding his approach, thanksgivings\r\nattending on his steps, and successes which a Howard might have envied,\r\nand triumphs which a Caesar could not have won, following in his train.\r\nIn five years from the commencement of his services, he had obtained the\r\npledge of five millions of persons in Ireland alone, to the practice of\r\ntotal abstinence. The fame of his good deeds having long before crossed\r\nthe Channel, he yielded to invitations, and visited Scotland and England\r\nin 1842-3, administering the pledge to half a million of people. During\r\nthe following six years, this remarkable man has prosecuted his work\r\nwith all the constancy which the famine-stricken condition of his\r\nfellow-subjects would permit. He has raised up a myriad throng of\r\nemancipated men to call him blessed.\r\n\r\nThis great Irish reform, mildly winning its way through all the avenues\r\nof society, has done wonders in elevating the social condition of that\r\nunfortunate people. Even if this truly good man had not visited America\r\non his errand of mercy, but merely as a traveler on a tour of\r\nobservation and pleasure, the rich blessings he has showered upon his\r\ncountry and mankind would entitle him to the warm greeting, alike\r\nhonorable to us and to him, which a generous nation tenders to a devoted\r\nphilanthropist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n     International Peace--European Military Establishments--British\r\n     Establishment--Mr. Cobden--Peace Party in England--Peace Congress\r\n     in Paris--Elihu Burritt--Charles Sumner.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy limits forbid such an extended notice of the sublime enterprise of\r\nInternational Peace as its importance demands, and my own feelings\r\ndictate.\r\n\r\nAt the present hour, about two millions of Europeans, in the prime of\r\nmanhood, are withdrawn from the arts of peace, to bear the sword and the\r\nmusket, and hold themselves ready, at the beck of diplomatic chicane and\r\nthe tap of the drum, to slaughter other millions, in defense of\r\narbitrary or aristocratic governments. To maintain these two millions,\r\non ship and on shore, costs directly and indirectly two hundred millions\r\nsterling per annum.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain has been a severe sufferer for naval and military \"glory.\"\r\nFrom 1793 to 1815, her public debt increased L600,000,000, the greater\r\npart of this sum being expended in contests with Napoleon and his\r\nallies. Since the peace of 1815, she has spent an average of full\r\nL15,000,000 per year for warlike objects. Paying her sailors and\r\nsoldiers at the meanest rates, she gives large salaries to their\r\nofficers, lavishing incredible sums on many of them for doing literally\r\nnothing. There are in the army sinecure colonelcies alone to the amount\r\nof L200,000 per annum, and Prince Albert, who never saw and never will\r\nsee a shot fired in anger, pockets yearly L8000 for sporting a Field\r\nMarshal's uniform, on court days, in the drawing-room of St. James'.\r\nThe pay of the soldiers and marines is plucked from the pockets and\r\nstomachs of the laboring poor. No wonder that Cobden, Sturge, Gurney,\r\nLee, Hindley, Ewart, Conder, Miall, Burnet, Vincent, and their\r\nassociates, think this anti-christian system should come to an end. The\r\nPeace party in England is rapidly becoming so influential that it will\r\nsoon make itself felt in the National Councils. MR. COBDEN'S motion\r\n(which is postponed rather than defeated) to reduce the national\r\nexpenditures L10,000,000 per annum is aimed at the army and navy. It\r\nwill ultimately triumph, and with usurious interest for all delays. A\r\nlarge share of the Complete Suffragists, of the Free Traders, of the\r\nFinancial Reformers, and, indeed, of the radicals generally, if not\r\ntechnically \"Peace-men,\" are hostile to the existing military and naval\r\nestablishments. Mr. Cobden, from his eminent talents, his distinguished\r\nservices, and his firm hold on the popular mind, may be regarded as the\r\nleader of the Peace movement in England.\r\n\r\nThe Peace Congress, held in Paris, during the past summer, in whose\r\nproceedings so many eminent philanthropists of various countries\r\nparticipated, has given an impulse to the pacific enterprise in Europe.\r\n\r\nFrom the list of American names that have aided this cause, it will not\r\nbe invidious to select two, as worthy of special commendation: the\r\nphilanthropic and indefatigable ELIHU BURRITT, who has done so much\r\nduring the last three years to arouse the attention of England to the\r\nhorrors of war and the blessings of peace; and CHARLES SUMNER, the\r\naccomplished lawyer, classical scholar, and eloquent orator, whose\r\nwritings and speeches, alike instructive and brilliant, have greatly\r\nassisted in commending this noble reform to public favor both in our own\r\nand foreign States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Elizabeth Fry--Mrs. Amelia Opie--Lady Noel Byron--Miss Harriet\r\n     Martineau--Mrs. Mary Howitt.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would do injustice to my own feelings and the facts of history, to\r\nleave it to be inferred, from my silence, that the Women of England have\r\nnot furnished some of the brightest names in the galaxy of Modern\r\nReformers.\r\n\r\nLooking ever so casually in this direction, what figure so promptly\r\nmeets the eye as that of ELIZABETH FRY--the friend of the prisoner, the\r\nbondman, the lunatic, the beggar--who has been aptly named \"the female\r\nHoward\"? Mrs. Fry hardly deserved more credit for the benevolent\r\nimpulses of her heart, than for the dignity and urbanity of her manners.\r\nThey were natural, for they were born with her. The daughter of John,\r\nand the sister of Joseph and Samuel Gurney, could hardly be else than\r\nthe embodiment of that charity which never faileth, that philanthropy\r\nwhich embraces every form of human misery, and that amenity which\r\nproffers the cup of kindness with an angel's grace. In youth, her\r\npersonal attractions, and the vivacity of her conversation, made her the\r\nidol of the social circle, and severe was her struggle in deciding\r\nwhether to become the reigning belle of the neighborhood, or devote her\r\nlife to assuaging the sorrows of a world of suffering and crime.\r\nHappily, she resolved that Humanity had higher claims upon her than\r\nFashion. Her resolution once formed, she immediately entered upon the\r\nholy mission to which, for nearly half a century, she consecrated that\r\nabounding benevolence and winning grace, which, in her girlhood, were\r\nthe pride of her parents and the delight of her companions.\r\n\r\nThough her eye was ever open to discover, and her hand to relieve, all\r\nforms of sorrow, it was to the inmates of the mad-house and the\r\npenitentiary that she mainly devoted her exertions. Wonderful was her\r\npower over the insane. The keenest magnetic eye of the most experienced\r\nkeeper paled and grew feeble in its sway over the raving maniac,\r\ncompared with the tones of her magic voice. Equally fascinating was her\r\ninfluence over prisoners and felons. Many a time, in spite of the sneers\r\nof vulgar turnkeys, and the positive assurances of respectable keepers,\r\nthat her purse and even her life would be at stake if she entered the\r\nwards of the prison, she boldly went in amongst the swearing, quarreling\r\nwretches, and, with the doors bolted behind her, encountered them with\r\ndignified demeanor and kindly words, that soon produced a state of order\r\nand repose which whips and chains had vainly endeavored to enforce.\r\nPossessing peculiar powers of eloquence, (why may not a woman be an\r\n\"orator?\") she used to assemble the prisoners, address them in a style\r\nof charming tenderness all her own, win their assent to regulations for\r\ntheir conduct which she proposed, shake hands with them, give and\r\nreceive a blessing, return to the keeper's room, and be received by him\r\nwith almost as much astonishment and awe as Darius exhibited toward\r\nDaniel, when he emerged from the den of lions.\r\n\r\nIn this way, Mrs. Fry made frequent examinations of the prisons of\r\nEngland. She pursued her holy work on the Continent, visiting prisons in\r\nFrance, Holland, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, and Prussia. In the early\r\npart of her career, she encountered both at home and abroad some\r\nrudeness, and many rebuffs. But her ever-present dignity, tact, and\r\nkindness, at length won the confidence and plaudits of the great\r\nmajority of her own countrymen, and of many philanthropists and titled\r\npersonages in other lands. She was a favorite of the Kings of Prussia\r\nand Denmark--the former, when in England, paying her a complimentary\r\nvisit at her own house. She sought frequent occasions to press, in\r\nperson, the subject of her mission upon the attention of crowned heads\r\nand ministers of state. She accomplished a great work in the cause of\r\nPrison Reform, in ameliorating the Penal Code, and improving the\r\ncondition of convict ships and penal colonies. Her special mouthpiece in\r\nParliament was her brother-in-law, Mr. Buxton--her measures were\r\nsupported by Mackintosh and other illustrious Senators--and it is the\r\nhighest tribute to the dignity which her rare excellences threw over her\r\nenterprises, that they got the better of Sydney Smith's love of\r\nridicule, and drew from him two or three articles in their favor in the\r\nEdinburgh Review. This greatly useful and greatly beloved woman died in\r\n1845, at the age of sixty-six. To her may be applied with equal\r\npropriety Burke's beautiful tribute to Howard:\r\n\r\n     \"She visited all Europe, not to survey the sumptuousness of\r\n     palaces, or the stateliness of temples; not to make accurate\r\n     measurements of the remains of ancient grandeur, nor to form a\r\n     scale of the curiosities of modern art; not to collect medals, nor\r\n     collate manuscripts; but to dive into the depths of dungeons, to\r\n     plunge into the infection of hospitals, to survey the mansions of\r\n     sorrow and pain; to take the guage and dimensions of misery,\r\n     depression, and contempt; to remember the forgotten, to attend to\r\n     the neglected, to visit the forsaken, and compare and collate the\r\n     miseries of all men in all countries. Her plan was original: it was\r\n     as full of genius as of humanity. It was a voyage of discovery; a\r\n     circumnavigation of charity. Already, the benefit of her labor is\r\n     felt more or less in every country.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Fry having been a member of the Society of Friends, we easily turn\r\nto Mrs. AMELIA OPIE, also belonging to that venerable body. As Mrs. Opie\r\nwrote the celebrated work on _Lying_, we must tell the truth if we say\r\nanything of this excellent lady. When I saw her, though the sun and\r\nshade of more than sixty years had flitted across her path, her\r\nconversation and manners retained much of the sprightliness of youth,\r\nand would have been _very_ agreeable, had she not affected more\r\njuvenility than she really possessed. Nearly half a century before, she\r\nhad sent to press a volume of poems, marked by graceful versification,\r\nsweetness, and pathos; and a domestic tale, \"The Father and Daughter,\"\r\nwhich was distinguished, amongst the mass of sentimental nonsense which\r\nfloated all around, by lively narrative, and a high moral tone. This\r\nnovel run through several editions, and still holds its place in\r\nlibraries. Since then, numerous works of fiction have flowed from her\r\npen, which bear the same literary impress, are elevated in their moral\r\naim, and tend to soften the heart, and make us love mankind better than\r\nbefore. Some of Mrs. Opie's best gifts have been laid on the altar of\r\nhumanity. She has been the warm friend, both in youth and in old age, of\r\nenterprises for the improvement of man, without respect to clime, creed,\r\nor color.\r\n\r\nI have said that Mrs. Opie was a Quakeress. In doctrine, she belongs to\r\nthe straitest of the sect, while she talks of Barclay's Apology and\r\nByron's Childe Harold, of George Fox's preaching and Walter Scott's\r\nnovels, in the same sentence, and with equal delight. Suppose her _thee_\r\nand _thou_ did sound oddly in such company, and her tongue trip\r\noccasionally when repeating some of Tom Moore's champagne jokes at Lord\r\nHolland's dinners; and suppose her dress is juvenile in style, and\r\nfastidious in arrangement, dazzling the eyes as it throws back in\r\ndisdain the envious brilliancy of the blazing chandelier, showing that\r\nno belle in the room has toiled more hours at her toilet this evening,\r\nthan she; still she is good Mrs. Opie, is not \"a birth-right member\" of\r\nthe plain-speaking and plain-dressing sect, but joined them \"on\r\nconvincement,\" while far advanced in life, with habits firmly fixed, and\r\nafter passing the line when it is easier to change one's creed than\r\none's manners. Under that glossy satin dress, there beats a heart whose\r\nevery avenue is open to truth, and whose sympathies gush out in streams\r\nthat return not to their fountain, till they have swept the entire\r\ncircle of human want and woe. Suppose this worthy Christian\r\nphilanthropist is rather fond of telling her auditors (and are they not\r\nfond of hearing?) the fine things Sir Walter Scott said to her in\r\nMelrose Abbey, or the flat joke that some flatter earl cracked in her\r\near when leading her into the drawing-room of Lord Fitzfoozle, or what\r\nCampbell said to her at her own house, when she was participating in a\r\ndiscussion with Wordsworth and Sir Thomas Lawrence, about the relative\r\nmerits of poetry and painting, or how she used up all her stock of\r\nFrench the day she dined with Lafayette--she is only one of a great\r\ncrowd of book writers and book readers on both sides of the Atlantic,\r\nwho are fond of insinuating that they have shone as conspicuous spangles\r\nin more than one comet's luminous tail.\r\n\r\nIn her declining years, Mrs. Opie has occasionally sent into the world\r\nsome effusion of her benevolent pen, on religious and charitable\r\nsubjects--lives in a neat style at Norwich--shows her visitors rooms\r\nlined with rare paintings, partly the product of her husband's lively\r\npencil--is active in all works of love and mercy--was on familiar terms\r\nwith the late warm-hearted Bishop of Norwich--and delights to guide her\r\nfriends through the long aisles of the aged cathedral, when the organ\r\nsounds its sweetest notes.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances under which I first saw Mrs. Opie remind me to say a\r\nfew words of Lady NOEL BYRON, the widow of the poet. She appeared as\r\nmild as the blue sky of an Italian summer evening. Edified by her\r\nintelligent conversation, and charmed with the softened grace of her\r\nmanners, one could not but say to himself--Can it be that that mild blue\r\neye, that mellow voice, that bland mien belonged to _the_ Lady Byron,\r\nthe wife of the wild genius, whose erratic fire, while it startled the\r\nround world with its glare, withered all that was sweet and lovely\r\nwithin its own domestic circle, nor paled till it had consumed its\r\nowner by the intensity of its own volcanic hell? Hidden under that pale\r\ncheek and quiet countenance, there _may_ lie the smoldering embers of\r\npassions that once shot their flames through the very veins of the bard,\r\nand made him the mad suicide he was. But they now slumber so profoundly,\r\nthat one must disbelieve they ever existed. The mystery must die with\r\nthe parties.\r\n\r\nThere is a sprightliness in the conversation of Lady Byron that wins the\r\nlistener, and a common sense that edifies him, while the tinge of\r\nsadness which flows through it gives a serious and sincere hue to the\r\nvein of pure morality that pervades much of this unfortunate woman's\r\ndiscourse. Decidedly plain-looking--for, even in the bloom of youth, she\r\ncould not have been handsome--her countenance when in repose is rather\r\ndull and uninteresting, but it kindles up when excited by the contact of\r\nkindred minds, and is set off by an address and manners familiar and\r\neasy.\r\n\r\nLady Byron has found occasional relief from the cloud which memory hangs\r\nover her, by participating in enterprises of charity and philanthropy.\r\nIndeed, she seemed to be quite a reformer, apparently holding firmly,\r\nwhile uttering cautiously, the liberal political sentiments which\r\nconstituted the redeeming feature in her husband's character. As might\r\nbe expected, she is sensitive to all allusions in her presence to him,\r\nseeming desirous that the thick veil of oblivion should hide all traces\r\nof their lamentable union and separation. It is not so with her\r\ndaughter, Ada Augusta--the \"gentle Ada\"--since Lady Lovelace, who loves\r\nto talk of her father, and glows with delight when you tell her that his\r\nworks are universally read, not only in the seaboard cities of America,\r\nbut among the far-away woods and prairies of the New World.\r\n\r\nWho that can appreciate a happy blending of philosophical acumen with\r\nphilanthropic devotion, illustrated in writings profound and poetic, and\r\nconversation rational and racy, could fail to be pleased with Miss\r\nHARRIET MARTINEAU--in spite of her tin trumpet? And well would it be\r\nfor their own reputation and the comfort of society, if many authors and\r\ntalkers used a trumpet to gather up the responses of their readers and\r\nauditors, rather than to blow private griefs or fancied merits in the\r\naverted face of the public. Descended from one of the families exiled\r\nfrom France on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, Miss Martineau\r\ninherits the fondness for philosophical speculation and the vivacity of\r\nspirit of the people whence she traces her lineage, mingled with the\r\nhatred of tyranny and love of toleration which the event that drove her\r\nforefathers to England was calculated to inspire. These French Puritans,\r\nwherever scattered up and down the world by the bigotry of Louis XIV, if\r\nthey have had less of iron in their character and marble in their aspect\r\nthan the Huguenots of Plymouth, they have displayed, under persecutions\r\nequally severe, as heroic a defense of their own civil and religious\r\nfreedom, while exhibiting in their treatment of others a larger measure\r\nof that charity which suffereth long and is kind.\r\n\r\nMiss Martineau became a student in extreme youth. While a girl, delicate\r\nhealth prevented her mingling in pastimes usual to her sex and years,\r\nand she sought society in books. Subsequently, an embarrassing deafness\r\nthrew her upon her own mental resources for amusement and instruction.\r\nGifted with ready powers of writing, and the needed motive for \"trying\r\nher hand\" being found in pecuniary necessity, she naturally turned from\r\nreading books to making them, and became an author at the age of twenty.\r\nDuring the next twenty-five years, she sent to press numerous works,\r\nranging over a wide field of topics, from verses and stories adapted to\r\nthe nursery and the school, to volumes on political economy and\r\npoor-laws, after the order of Bentham and Malthus. She has written\r\ntales, novels, prayers, hymns, illustrations of political economy and\r\npauperism and taxation, sketches of travels in Europe, Asia, Africa and\r\nAmerica, and numberless papers for reviews and magazines, exhibiting\r\nhigh powers of reflection and rare graces of composition, and aiming at\r\nthe great and good end of instructing, amusing, and elevating mankind.\r\nTwo of her most interesting publications, and they are among the most\r\nrecent, are \"Life in a Sick Room\" and \"The Holy Land\"--the former, a\r\nbeautiful record of her own experience and reflections while suffering\r\nunder deep-seated disease; the latter, a vivid and graphic picture of\r\nher lingerings around the sacred scenes of Palestine.\r\n\r\nThe works of Miss Martineau that produced the greatest sensation, and\r\nmost widely extended her reputation, are those on political subjects. In\r\npolitics, for she is a politician, she must be classed with the radicals\r\nof the school of Bentham, Cobden, and Hume. This fact, uniting with the\r\nclass of topics she handled, have not vouchsafed to her exemption from\r\nthe canons and hot shot of criticism to which the writings of the other\r\nsex are exposed. And she is too much of a woman to plead her sex in bar\r\nof the operation of any legitimate rule of literary warfare. She is able\r\nto give as well as take in the arena of authorship. Her works, or rather\r\ntales, (for she dressed her disquisitions in the drapery of fiction,) on\r\npolitical economy, poor-laws, and cognate subjects, drew down upon her\r\nthe sneers and maledictions of the High Tory Quarterly Review--the\r\nformer being aimed at her sex, the latter at her doctrines--which only\r\nresulted in proving that the critics had very slender claims to be\r\nregarded either as gentlemen, philosophers or statesmen. So novel was\r\nher undertaking, that she encountered great difficulty in getting a\r\npublisher for her \"Illustrations.\" She first offered them to the\r\ngenerally astute and always liberal Society for the Diffusion of Useful\r\nKnowledge. The managers declined to issue them, prophesying that the\r\nproject would prove a dead failure. At length a bookseller was found,\r\nhardy enough, or wise enough, to send into the world essays on political\r\neconomy, poor-laws, and taxation, dressed up in fiction by the hand of a\r\nwoman. The success of the experiment was immediate and complete. The\r\nnumbers were eagerly bought as they came out, the advent of each link\r\nin the series being looked for with as much interest as Dickens'\r\nNickleby or Dombey; new editions followed new editions; Germany and\r\nFrance translated and sent them over Europe; till the most driveling\r\nspecimen of Britain's old-womanish legislation received a shock from\r\nwhich it has never recovered, and looked at one time as if it might fall\r\na sudden victim to the exposures of a comparatively young damsel.\r\n\r\nMrs. MARY HOWITT has walked gracefully over a portion of the same field\r\nof literature as Miss Martineau, gathering flowers not seen by or not\r\ncongenial to the eye of the more matter-of-fact disciple of the great\r\nUtilitarian. She has more poetry and less philosophy in her temperament\r\nthan Miss Martineau, is more domestic and rural in her tastes, grapples\r\nless with themes that agitate senates, and has a heart more susceptible\r\nto the _individual_ joys and sorrows of mankind. She is equally\r\nbountiful in her contributions to the every-day reading of the times;\r\ngives her writings a high moral aim; makes her readers good-humored, and\r\noverflowing with _bonhommie_; and if she does not set them to thinking\r\nso hard about the causes of human misery, stimulates them to as much\r\nactivity in alleviating the effects.\r\n\r\nIn 1823, soon after her marriage with Mr. Howitt--and two more congenial\r\nspirits never closed hands at the altar--they jointly published \"The\r\nForest Minstrel,\" a volume abounding in lively pictures of rural\r\nscenery, and filial reverence for the poetry of the olden time. They\r\nmade a tour of Scotland, traveling more than a thousand miles over\r\nhighland and moorland, half of which they performed on foot, drinking at\r\nthe storied fountains, and holding familiar converse with the spirits\r\nthat haunt the old castles and battle-fields of a country whose\r\nnovelists and bards have associated\r\n\r\n  \"With every glen and every stream,\r\n  The romance of some warrior dream.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tour, taken when their minds were alive to the sublimities and\r\nbeauties of the scenery, and when their poetic eye threw its young\r\nglance upon each filament of the drapery that song and story have spread\r\nover every spot between Tweed-dale and Loch Ness, gave form and color to\r\nall the subsequent writings of the Howitts. Returning home, they\r\npublished another volume of poetry, which, like the first, was warmly\r\neulogized by the public press. They were now fairly launched on the\r\nstream of English literature. For several years Mrs. Howitt gave much\r\ntime to the preparation of works for the young. Being first enlisted in\r\nthis department by the wants of her own rising household, she\r\nsubsequently wrote for the public, throwing off scores of stories, which\r\nwere bought, read, and admired by \"the million\" of her own country, are\r\nfound in \"morocco and gilt\" on marble tables in American cities, and in\r\nyellow covers in the log huts beyond the mountains, while some, through\r\nthe medium of translations, have found their way into the nurseries of\r\nGermany and the forest-homes of Poland.\r\n\r\nAfter a variety of literary adventures in England, Mr. and Mrs. Howitt\r\nvisited Germany, about 1840, where they resided some three years. Here\r\nthey acquired a knowledge, among others, of the Swedish tongue. The\r\nresult of their continental sojourn was the translation into English by\r\nhim of the celebrated \"Student Life in Germany,\" and the publication of\r\nhis \"Social and Rural Life in Germany,\" and her translation and\r\nintroduction to British and American readers of the now widely known\r\nSwedish novels of Frederika Bremer. Deeply sympathizing with all efforts\r\nto elevate the mind and condition of their countrymen, and feeling the\r\nneed of a weekly periodical that should combine high literary qualities\r\nwith radical political doctrines, they started, in 1846, \"The People's\r\nJournal.\" Mrs. Howitt was a large contributor to its pages, both under\r\nits original name and that of Howitt's Journal. Some numbers of the\r\nlatter for the closing part of the year 1847 are now under my eye, and I\r\nam struck with the great amount, varied character, and benevolent aim\r\nof her contributions. Stories for children; translations from Hans\r\nChristian Andersen; poetic gems; a sketch of Laura Bridgman;\r\ntranslations of Swedish and Hungarian tales; a sketch of \"the Deserter\r\nin London,\" which kindles indignation against war; \"Love passages in the\r\nlives of every-day people;\" a most eloquent petition to the Queen, for\r\ncommuting the sentence of a woman then lying in Newgate, whose execution\r\nhad been postponed that she might give birth to a child--these, and such\r\npapers, scattered through the Journal, exhibit the mode in which Mrs.\r\nHowitt has spent her life of late years. And, her husband being witness,\r\nshe is not only an industrious authoress, but a model wife and mother.\r\n\r\nWhile the Journal gave an impulse to the cause of freedom, it was most\r\ndisastrous to the pecuniary interests of the Howitts. They have had\r\ntheir full share of the joys and sorrows, honors and perplexities,\r\nprofits and losses of literary life. They have encountered their\r\ncheckered lot with as hopeful a brow as anybody can be expected to\r\nexhibit, that attempts to get a living by writing \"books which _are_\r\nbooks,\" in this age of \"_cheap_ literature.\" In prosperity and\r\nadversity, they have given hand, heart and pen to progress and reform.\r\nShould they ever accomplish their purpose of visiting America, the\r\nfriends of pure and pleasing literature would unite with the friends of\r\nsocial and political reform, to give them welcome hands with hearts in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\n     The Literature of Freedom--The Liberal Literature of\r\n     England--Periodicals--Edinburgh Review--Its Founders--Its\r\n     Contributors--Its Standard and Style of Criticism--Its\r\n     Influence--London Quarterly Review Started--Political Services of\r\n     the Edinburgh--Its Ecclesiastical Tone--Sydney Smith--Decline of\r\n     the Political Influence of the Edinburgh--Blackwood's\r\n     Magazine--Tait's Magazine--Westminster Review--The Eclectic--The\r\n     New Monthly--The Weekly Press--Cobbett's Register--Hunt's\r\n     Examiner--Mr. Fonblanque--Mr. Landor--The Spectator--Douglas\r\n     Jerrold--Punch--People's and Howitt's Journals--Mr.\r\n     Howitt--Chambers's Journal--Penny Magazine and Cyclopedia.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the times of the Commonwealth, when the mind of England was set free,\r\nMilton was the center of a constellation of intellects that exemplified\r\nin their writings the value of his own saying--\"Give me the liberty to\r\nknow and to argue freely, above all other liberties.\" After his sun set,\r\nliberty without licentiousness hid behind a cloud, which was not fully\r\ncleared away till the storm of the American and French revolutions.\r\nWhile the literature of England depended for sustenance upon the\r\npatronage of the great, it was marked, with occasional exceptions, by\r\nthe brand of servility; and so long as authors looked for remuneration\r\nto the munificence of the lord or lady to whom they dedicated their\r\nworks, they laid their choicest gifts at the footstool of power and\r\ntitle. As education became diffused, enlarging the circle of readers,\r\nwriters began to look to the public for patronage, and adapted their\r\nworks to the popular taste. Then the publishers and booksellers became\r\nthe agents, the middle-men, between the author and the reader. Long\r\nafter this change, however, it was hazardous for a writer to lift his\r\npen against existing institutions in Church and State; and he who run a\r\ntilt against these, were he able to make sale of his works, might deem\r\nhimself fortunate if he escaped a prosecution for libel or sedition,\r\nthat emptied his purse of its guineas, or planted his feet in the\r\nstocks. Even so late as the beginning of this century, the instances\r\nwere not a few where writers, who doubted the divinity of the royal\r\nGuelphs, and questioned whether all the religion in the kingdom emanated\r\nfrom Lambeth Palace, were fined, cropped, branded, and shipped beyond\r\nseas. The impulse given to European intellect by the first French\r\nrevolution, was not confined to statesmen and warriors. It stimulated\r\nthought in all classes. As in politics, so in letters, fetters fell from\r\nmen's minds, and reason, imagination, and utterance were emancipated.\r\nThe Fox school of politicians encouraged the growth of a literature in\r\nEngland favorable to freedom. It immediately started up, rank and\r\nluxuriant; and though bearing every variety of fruit that could delight\r\nthe eye, or regale the appetite, or poison the taste, the decided\r\npreponderance of the product has been congenial to rational liberty,\r\nhealthy morals, and sound learning.\r\n\r\nIn estimating the literary influences which have contributed to the\r\ncause of Progress and Reform in Great Britain, during the present\r\ncentury, a high place should be assigned to the EDINBURGH REVIEW.\r\n\r\nThis celebrated periodical appeared at an era when independence of\r\nthought and manliness of utterance had almost ceased from the public\r\njournals and councils of the kingdom. The terrors of the French\r\nrevolution had arrested the march of liberal opinions. The declamation\r\nof Burke and the ambition of Napoleon had frightened the isle from its\r\npropriety. Tooke had barely escaped the gallows through the courageous\r\neloquence of Erskine. Fox had withdrawn from the contest in despair,\r\nand cherished in secret the fires of freedom, to burst forth in happier\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nPrevious to 1802, the literary periodicals of Great Britain were mere\r\nrepositories of miscellanies, relating to art, poetry, letters, and\r\ngossip, partly original and partly selected, huddled together without\r\nsystem, and making up a medley as varied and respectable as a first\r\nclass weekly newspaper of the present day. The criticisms of books were\r\njejune in the extreme, consisting chiefly of a few smart witticisms, and\r\nmeager connecting remarks stringing together ample quotations from the\r\nwork under review. They rarely ventured into deep water on philosophical\r\nsubjects, and as seldom pushed out upon the tempestuous sea of political\r\ndiscussion. Perhaps one or two journals might plead a feeble exception\r\nto the general rule; but the mass was weary, stale, flat, and\r\nunprofitable.\r\n\r\nThe Edinburgh appeared. It bounded into the arena without the\r\ncountenance of birth or station, without the imprimatur of the\r\nuniversities or literary clubs. Its avowed mission was to erect a higher\r\nstandard of merit, and secure a bolder style and a purer taste in\r\nliterature, and to apply philosophical principles and the maxims of\r\ntruth and humanity to politics, aiming to be the manual of the scholar,\r\nthe monitor of the statesman. As in its advent it had asked permission\r\nof no one _to be_, so as to its future course it asked no advice as to\r\nwhat it should _do_. Soliciting no quarter, promising no favors, its\r\nindependent bearing and defiant tone broke the spell which held the mind\r\nof a nation in fetters. Its first number revived the discussion of great\r\npolitical principles. The splendid diction and searching philosophy of\r\nan essay on the causes and consequences of the French revolution at once\r\narrested the public eye, and stamped the character of the journal.\r\nPedants in the pulpit, and scribblers of Rosa-Matilda verses in printed\r\nalbums, saw, from other articles in the manifesto, that exterminating\r\nwar was declared on their inanities and sentimentalities. The new\r\njournal was perused with avidity, and produced a sensation in all\r\nclasses of readers, exciting admiration and envy, love and hatred,\r\ndefiance and fear. It rapidly obtained a large circulation, steadily\r\nrose to the highest position ever attained by any similar publication,\r\nreigned supreme in an empire of its own creation for a third of a\r\ncentury, accomplishing vast good mingled with no inconsiderable evil.\r\n\r\nThe honor of founding this Review belongs to Sydney Smith. He suggested\r\nthe idea to Messrs. Jeffrey, Brougham, and Murray--he, a poor young\r\ncurate of Salisbury Plain, \"driven in stress of politics\" into\r\nEdinburgh, while on a voyage to Germany--they, briefless young advocates\r\nof the northern capital. They all subsequently rose to eminence; all\r\nbecoming lords except Smith, who might have been made a lord bishop if\r\nhe had not been created the prince of wits. The four adventurers, who\r\nmet in the eighth or ninth story of Buccleugh Place, and agreed to start\r\na Review, provided they could get the first number published on trust,\r\nthey not having money enough to pay the printer, could not have dreamed\r\nthat the journal would be eagerly read for half a century, from London\r\nto Calcutta, from the Cape of Good Hope to the sources of the\r\nMississippi, and that Brougham would become Lord Chancellor of Great\r\nBritain, Jeffrey Lord Justice of the highest court of Scotland, Murray\r\nalso Lord Justice of Scotland, and Smith Canon of St. Paul's Cathedral,\r\nfiring hot shot at Pennsylvanians for not paying interest on a small\r\nloan from his surplus of L70,000.\r\n\r\nDid space permit, it might be interesting to attempt to trace the causes\r\nof the great power which this periodical exerted over public opinion.\r\nThe temper of the times when it appeared in respect to politics, and the\r\nDead Sea of dullness in literary criticism that spread all around, gave\r\nnovelty to an enterprise which proposed to combine the highest literary\r\nand scientific excellences with the boldest discussion of public men and\r\naffairs. The execution of the plan came up to the lofty tone of the\r\nmanifesto. In its infancy, and onward to its maturity, the Edinburgh\r\nsurrounded itself with a host of contributors whose names have given and\r\nreceived celebrity from its pages. Smith, Jeffrey, Brougham, Murray,\r\nScott, Playfair, Leslie, Brewster, Stewart, Horner, Romilly, Stephen,\r\nMackintosh, Brown, Malthus, Ricardo, Hallam, Hamilton, Hazlitt, Forster,\r\nMcCulloch, Macaulay, Carlyle, Talfourd--and these are but a tithe--have\r\ngiven it their choicest productions, ranging through the fields of\r\npolitics, finance, jurisprudence, ethics, science, poetry, art, and\r\nletters, in all their multiform departments. The contributions of many\r\nof these writers have been extracted and published in separate volumes,\r\nwhich, in their turn, have challenged the criticism of celebrated\r\nreviewers on both sides of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nNor was less zest imparted to its earlier pages because ability was not\r\nalways accompanied with candor, and attacks upon distinguished authors\r\nand statesmen were no less fierce than assaults upon popular works and\r\nvenerable institutions. Persons and principles were alike mixed in the\r\nmelee. Nobody, nothing was spared that opposed the march of the literary\r\nTamerlane. In the department of literary criticism, its standard was\r\njust, lofty, or capricious, according to its mood; its style, by turns\r\nand by authors, grave or sarcastic, eulogistic or saucy, argumentative\r\nor sentimental, chaste or slashing, classical or savage. A man-of-war of\r\nthe first class, and of the regular service, when civil and\r\necclesiastical abuses were to be discovered and destroyed, in literary\r\ncontests it often run up the flag and used the weapons of the buccaneer.\r\nNot only did it exterminate the small craft of penny-a-line novelists\r\nand poetasters, but it pursued Wordsworth, Southey, Coleridge, Byron,\r\nMontgomery, Lamb, and all with whom they treated or sympathized, with a\r\nspirit akin to that of the \"Red Corsair of the Mozambique,\" when chasing\r\n\r\n  ----\"Argosies with portly sail,\r\n  Flying by him with their woven wings,\r\n  Rich with Barbaric pearl and gold.\"\r\n\r\nThe very temerity of the Review, sustained by such rare learning,\r\nability, and brilliancy, gave it currency with friends and foes. It was\r\nadmitted by its enemies that no similar publication displayed so many\r\nrich veins of thought, uttered so many acute observations, or arrayed\r\nits offspring in such graceful drapery; and they found fault, not so\r\nmuch with the standards set up, or the principles inculcated, as with\r\ntheir alleged unjust application to their favorite books and authors.\r\nThe answer of the reviewers was short and characteristic. If they used\r\nthe stiletto or the scalping-knife when they ought to use the scimitar\r\nor the broad-sword, why, that was according to the canons of criticism\r\nthey had in such cases made and provided, and the friends of the slain\r\nmight resort to reprisals.\r\n\r\nA specimen of the mode in which it drowned in ridicule pedantry and\r\nstupidity, is found in the first number, in a review, by Sydney Smith,\r\nof Rev. Dr. Langford's \"Anniversary Sermon of the Royal Humane Society.\"\r\nAfter giving the title of the publication in the usual form, the\r\nreviewer says: \"An accident which happened to the gentleman engaged in\r\nreviewing this sermon proves, in the most striking manner, the\r\nimportance of this charity for restoring to life persons in whom the\r\nvital power is suspended. He was discovered with Dr. Langford's\r\ndiscourse lying open before him, in a state of the most profound sleep,\r\nfrom which he could not, by any means, be awakened for a great length of\r\ntime. By attending, however, to the rules prescribed by the Humane\r\nSociety, flinging in the smoke of tobacco, applying hot flannels, and\r\ncarefully removing the discourse itself to a great distance, the critic\r\nwas restored to his disconsolate brothers. The only account he could\r\ngive of himself was, that he remembers reading on regularly, till he\r\ncame to the following pathetic description of a drowned tradesman;\r\nbeyond which he recollects nothing.\" Then follows a paragraph from the\r\nsermon, dropsical with dullness; and here the article ends.\r\n\r\nA specimen of the style in which it pronounced sentence of contempt on\r\nan author is found at a later date, and is perfect of its kind. It is\r\nthe introductory paragraph of Macaulay's review of Gleig's Life of\r\nWarren Hastings. \"This book,\" says Macaulay, \"seems to have been\r\nmanufactured in pursuance of a contract, by which the representatives of\r\nWarren Hastings, on the one part, bound themselves to furnish papers,\r\nand Mr. Gleig, on the other part, bound himself to furnish praise. It is\r\nbut just to say, that the covenants on both sides have been most\r\nfaithfully kept; and the result is before us in the form of three big\r\nbad volumes, full of undigested correspondence and undiscerning\r\npanegyric.\" Macaulay then goes on through seventy pages, giving his own\r\nbrilliant portrait of Hastings, never noticing the author except at long\r\nintervals, when he turns aside for a moment to give him a blow in the\r\nface with his brush.\r\n\r\nThe Review gave an impulse to periodical literature, and elevated the\r\ntone of literary criticism and political disquisition. Grub street made\r\na stand against the invader, worthy of its ancient garrets. It issued\r\nfifty pamphlets in a single year, explaining, extenuating, defending,\r\ndefying. But dullness and insipidity at length gave way, and retreated\r\nrapidly to the trunk-makers and green grocers. Much evil was mingled\r\nwith the good. The excellences of the new journal were not alone\r\nimitated. Ferocity and fire blazed out from the pages of cotemporaneous\r\npublications. But, they were the rush-light to Vesuvius. At length,\r\nsoldiers of higher mettle and brighter armor than Grub street could\r\nmuster took the field. Byron had shivered a lance with the Edinburgh.\r\nSouthey, whose scalp it had mangled, was stung to madness, and vowed\r\nvengeance. Scott denounced its politics as rash, radical, and\r\nrevolutionary. The great Whig rhinoceros from beyond the Tweed had\r\nravaged the softer landscape of England, and tossed Tory politicians and\r\npoets on its horn for six years, when Brougham's celebrated article on\r\nDon Pedro de Cevallos and Spanish affairs appeared, avowing\r\nultra-democratic doctrines. Scott, who had some time before ceased to\r\nbe a contributor, now ordered his subscription stopped, and entered into\r\ncorrespondence with Ellis, Southey, Gifford, and others, in regard to\r\nstarting a rival periodical, that should encounter the spoiler in his\r\nown field, and with weapons of like temper and force. The result was the\r\nestablishment, in 1809, of the Quarterly Review, in London. Its editor\r\nwas William Gifford; and in boldness, bitterness, dogmatism, and\r\nferocity, he was a full match for any writer in the Edinburgh; though,\r\nin comprehension of broad principles and appreciation of the beautiful,\r\nin acuteness and originality, he fell below the journal he was set up to\r\noverthrow.\r\n\r\nBut, dazzling as has been the meteoric career of the Edinburgh in the\r\nfirmament of letters, it is in the department of governmental reform\r\nthat its greatest and best services have been rendered. Its founder has\r\nwell said, that at its advent \"it was always considered a piece of\r\nimpertinence in England if a man of less than L2,000 or L3,000 a year\r\nhad any opinion at all on important subjects.\" The Edinburgh Review has\r\ntaught a Manchester calico-printer how to take the Government by the\r\nbeard. In the forty-six years of its existence, it has seen the British\r\nslave trade abolished--a devastating European war terminated--the Holy\r\nAlliance broken up, and its anointed conspirators brought into\r\ncontempt--the corporation and test acts repealed--the Catholics\r\nemancipated--the criminal code humanized--the death-penalty\r\ncircumscribed--the reform bill carried, extending the suffrage to half a\r\nmillion of people--West India and East India slavery abolished--the\r\ncommercial monopoly of the East India Company overthrown--municipal\r\ncorporations reformed--the court of chancery opened, and sunlight let in\r\nupon its doings--the common law courts made more accessible to the\r\nmasses--the law of libel made endurable--the poor-laws made more\r\ncharitable--the game-laws brought nearer the verge of modern\r\ncivilization--the corn-laws repealed--the post-office made subservient\r\nto all who can raise a penny--the means of educating the poor\r\nincreased--the privileges of the Established Church curtailed in three\r\nkingdoms--and a long catalogue of minor reforms effected, and dignity\r\nand intensity imparted to the popular demand for still larger\r\nconcessions to the progressive genius of the age. And this journal may\r\nproudly say, that all these measures have received the support, and most\r\nof them the early, zealous, and powerful support of the Edinburgh\r\nReview. These measures gained advantages from the advocacy of the\r\nReview, far beyond the intrinsic force of the arguments with which it\r\nsupported them; as, indeed, did the party of progress whose oracle it\r\nwas. Its brilliant literary reputation shed a luster around the most\r\nradical political opinions, clothing them in bright raiment, and giving\r\nthem an introduction into the halls of the learned and the saloons of\r\nthe noble. Its numerous articles on liberal and general education,\r\nespecially those written by Sydney Smith, are above all praise. And\r\nwhile it impaled bores and charlatans in literature, and scourged quacks\r\nand villains in the State, it was no less a terror to hypocrites and\r\noppressors in the Church. But candor must admit, that if it was\r\ngenerally a terror to evil doers in the name of religion, it was not\r\nalways a praise to them that did well.\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiastical and religious tone of the Review, during the first\r\ntwenty years of its existence, was imparted to it mainly by Sydney\r\nSmith. He had a good deal more wit than charity; was not ashamed to\r\nsteal his sermons from Taylor, Hooker and Barrow, that he might save\r\ntime to shoot sarcasms at Wesley and \"the nasty Methodists,\" and shower\r\nridicule upon Wilberforce and \"the patent Christians at Clapham;\" and\r\nseemed to have little reverence for any part of the Establishment which\r\nhe defended, except its tithes and its titles. He pleaded for toleration\r\nand emancipation, not so much because Dissenters and Catholics deserved\r\nthem, but because to grant them would silence clamor, and more firmly\r\nsecure the power and patronage, and exalt the dignity of \"the Church.\"\r\nBut, though it breathed a good deal of this spirit, the Review always\r\ncontended for religious freedom, and, when need be, was as hearty in its\r\nassaults upon the miter of the primate, and its ridicule of the starched\r\nrobes of the bench of bishops, as of ranters and patent Christians.\r\nSydney Smith hated tyranny, but he loved money; he was a humane man, and\r\nno ascetic or bigot; and it was his superabundant wit, and the ludicrous\r\nlight in which almost everything struck his mind, that gave edge to his\r\nsarcasms, and made him seem more uncharitable than he really was. Two of\r\nhis articles in the Edinburgh carried through Parliament a bill\r\nextending to all grades of felons the full benefit of counsel when on\r\ntrial. Previous to this, counsel, even in capital cases, were not\r\nallowed to address juries in favor of prisoners, and before a poor\r\nwretch could get half through a stammering speech in his own behalf, he\r\nwas generally choked off by the judge, that he might be the more\r\nspeedily strangled by the hangman. Ah! old Dean Swift humanized; few men\r\nhave done more to explode error, shame bigotry, and expose abuses, than\r\nthou!\r\n\r\nAs a political journal, the influence of the Edinburgh Review has, to a\r\ngreat extent, passed away. Its power and glory culminated during the\r\nadministration of Earl Grey. Till then, it shone in unrivaled splendor,\r\npouring its beams in the path of progress, and shedding more light\r\naround the footsteps of reform than all other like sources combined.\r\nOther luminaries, fresher in their rising, and reflecting the opinions\r\nof the awakened mind of England, have dimmed its fires. It has grown\r\nwayward, timid, conservative, and aristocratic, touching gingerly, and\r\nwith gloved fingers, topics which it once handled without mittens. From\r\nthe hour it became the organ of power, it ceased to be the herald of the\r\npeople. In its decline, it has occasionally roused itself, and struck a\r\nblow for freedom, which revived the memory of the glorious days before\r\nthe blight of Conservatism came upon it. It has shared the fate of the\r\nWhigs, and of all Quarterlies, as the organs of political opinion.\r\nPeriodical literature has seen a revolution in the public taste.\r\nQuarterlies and Monthlies hardly survived the advent of railways. The\r\nelectric telegraph, which can barely keep pace with the revolutions of\r\nparties and states, has made even Weeklies seem stale. The Penny\r\nMagazine defies the Quarterly, and the Daily Press rules the hour. But,\r\nten thousand thanks to the Edinburgh Review, for ushering in an era\r\nwhich has made its own existence no longer necessary to the politician\r\nand the statesman.\r\n\r\nA brief notice of a few other liberal periodicals will close this\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nThe London Quarterly having failed to destroy the influence of the\r\nEdinburgh, a less stately and more lively periodical was planted on the\r\nspot where the great Whig champion bore sway, to encounter its politics\r\nwith the lighter weapons of wit and satire, and dispute its mastery in\r\nthe field of polite letters and criticism. Blackwood's Edinburgh\r\nMagazine entered the lists in 1817. Reckoning among its contributors\r\nsome of the ripest scholars and rarest wits of the times, it occupies a\r\nfirst place among literary journals, while able partisans sprinkle its\r\npages with the spiciest vindications of ultra Tory politics. During the\r\nreform-bill excitement, Tait's Edinburgh Magazine was sent forth as an\r\nantidote to Blackwood. A corps of rare essayists and critics have given\r\nit a highly respectable position in the literary world, and its\r\npolitical articles, written with vigor and eloquence, have kept pace\r\nwith the advancing step of the age.\r\n\r\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts had been made to establish a\r\npermanent Quarterly journal in London, to support the liberal side in\r\npolitics, Mr. Bentham and his disciples started the Westminster Review,\r\nin 1824. Leaping into the arena far ahead of the Edinburgh, it drew its\r\nblade in defense of the radicals, and proposed fundamental reforms in\r\nthe Constitution of the country. Reflecting the views of its celebrated\r\nfounder, it has advocated, with great ability, unqualified suffrage,\r\nfreedom of trade, the dissolution of the union of Church and State, the\r\nabolition of the hereditary feature of the House of Peers, the\r\nabrogation of the court of chancery, and a complete remodeling and\r\ncodification of the laws of the realm. Bentham, Bowring, Col. Thompson,\r\nand Roebuck have been among its political contributors, and many of its\r\nliterary articles have been of a high order. Carlyle has published in it\r\nseveral characteristic essays. It exhibits more courage and soul than\r\nany of its cotemporaries, and is the most democratic Quarterly in the\r\nkingdom. The Eclectic Review, a periodical devoted rather to\r\necclesiastical reforms, though it indulges in literature and politics,\r\nhas, under the control of Dr. Price, a distinguished Baptist clergyman,\r\nrendered good service in the cause of philanthropy. Robert Hall and John\r\nFoster, names familiar to scholars and divines in both hemispheres, used\r\nto contribute to its pages. The New Monthly Magazine, under the\r\neditorship of Campbell, and afterward of Bulwer, though chiefly devoted\r\nto literature, espoused the liberal side in politics. For a time it\r\nreceived the contributions of our accomplished countryman, Mr. Willis.\r\n\r\nBut, it is not the Quarterly and the Monthly that originate and guide\r\npublic opinion. At best, they but follow in its wake. The Weekly and the\r\nDaily trace the channels in which its currents flow. And here we are\r\nlaunched upon an ocean of periodical literature. From the days of\r\nWilkes' \"North Briton,\" down to those of Punch's \"Charivari,\" a\r\nconstantly swelling mass of newspapers has borne the cause of the People\r\nforward from triumph to triumph. Confining our view to those standing\r\nout of the mass, on peculiar and independent ground, the eye is at once\r\nattracted by the Register and the Examiner--the greatest of their class.\r\nThe former was founded by William Cobbett, the latter by Leigh Hunt; the\r\none uttering the discontents of the lower class of radicals, the other\r\nreflecting the opinions of the higher. Of Cobbett's writings I have\r\nalready spoken at considerable length. He was the best exponent of the\r\nwrongs, prejudices and hates of the subterranean strata of English\r\nsociety, that has ever appeared. The Examiner was established in 1809.\r\nIt displayed a much higher order of literary talent than the Register,\r\nbut was equally radical in politics, and scarcely less violent in its\r\nattacks on public men and institutions. Hunt was repeatedly prosecuted\r\nby the Government, and lay two years in prison for a libel on that\r\ndecoction of treachery and lechery, the Prince of Wales. While in jail,\r\nhe composed some of his best poems. The Examiner has always displayed\r\nmarked ability and brilliancy, both in its political and literary\r\ndepartments. While under the editorship of Mr. Fonblanque, a writer of\r\nextraordinary vigor and taste, it ordinarily produced political articles\r\nexecuted in a style that would have adorned the Edinburgh Review, while\r\ntheir doctrines were congenial to the progressive genius of the times.\r\nAmong its frequent contributors is the intrepid, proud, humane,\r\neccentric Walter Savage Landor, a poet of keen sensibilities, an ardent\r\nlover of truth and freedom--a man, \"take him all in all.\" Latterly, the\r\nreformatory tone of The Examiner is somewhat modified, but it maintains\r\nits place in the front rank of the weekly literary and political press.\r\nThe Spectator deservedly holds a high position in this department of\r\nnewspapers. At first it was strongly radical in its politics; but, like\r\nthe Examiner, it has latterly abated its tone without diminishing its\r\nability.\r\n\r\nBelonging to the same general class as the Examiner and Spectator, are\r\nthe various periodicals that have borne the name of Douglas Jerrold. Mr.\r\nJerrold has written successful melodramas, comedies, and farces for the\r\ntheaters; sparkling essays for the classic Blackwood; humorous and\r\nserious tales for the New Monthly; stories and squibs for Punch;\r\npolitical \"leaders\" for first-class newspapers; besides sketches,\r\ncriticisms, and \"articles\" without number for the million. Abounding in\r\nwit, sarcasm, humor, pathos, philosophy and fun, there runs through his\r\nwritings a large vein of unadulterated humanity, which gives life and\r\nheart to the whole. He wages holy war against fustian literature, sham\r\nstatesmanship, sectarian cant, legalized injustice, and titled tyranny.\r\nIf England's periodical writers were of his temper and metal, the good\r\ntime foreshadowed by Mackay, would soon come, when\r\n\r\n  \"The pen shall supersede the sword,\r\n  And right, not might, shall be the lord.\"\r\n\r\nHaving unexpectedly fallen upon Punch, in connection with Mr. Jerrold, I\r\nwill say that that eccentric person deserves honorable mention among\r\nEnglish Reformers. His unparalleled wit is tempered with love to\r\nmankind; his sympathies are with the million; and he displays in his\r\nweekly walk and conversation a great deal more humanity, quite as much\r\nChristian charity, (though far less \"religion,\") as \"The Church of\r\nEngland Quarterly Review,\" the organ of High Church Toryism. Punch is\r\ntoo much of a man to send Mr. Shore to prison, or to excommunicate Mr.\r\nNoel.\r\n\r\nThe People's Journal and Howitt's Journal are successful attempts to\r\nmingle tasteful literary essays with radical political disquisitions,\r\nand bring them within the reach of every-day men of business and toil.\r\nThough many accomplished writers contributed to their pages, the\r\nHowitts, who originated the enterprise, were for some time its animating\r\nsoul. The educated radicalism of England found an organ in these\r\njournals, whose tone harmonized with their sympathies. High as is Mr.\r\nHowitt's literary reputation, it is as a political and social reformer\r\nthat his name will be the most widely known. His \"History of\r\nPriestcraft,\" published in 1834, while he lived in Nottingham, and which\r\nmet a sale of some 20,000 copies, gave him eclat in a new field, brought\r\nhim some money, which he needed, and an election as alderman of that\r\ntown, which he did not want at all. Four years afterward, he published\r\n\"Colonization and Christianity,\" which led to the formation of the\r\nBritish India Society, to the abolition of slavery in the peninsula of\r\nHindostan, and to efforts to relieve from oppression and stimulate to\r\nenterprise the myriads that swarm in that long-neglected portion of the\r\nempire. Mr. Howitt's writings in behalf of Complete Suffrage, Religious\r\nToleration, and Irish Relief, are as honorable to the benevolence of his\r\nheart as are his numerous literary works to the fertility of his genius.\r\n\r\nStill confining myself to _quasi_ literary productions, I may mention in\r\nthis connection a series of publications, adapted to the means and\r\ncapacities of the common people, which, though not specially intended to\r\npromote social and political reform, exerted a powerful influence in\r\nthat direction. Chambers' Edinburgh Journal was commenced in 1832; it\r\nconsists of papers on literature, science, history and biography, and,\r\nbeing sold at a cheap rate, reached at one period a circulation of\r\nnearly 100,000 copies. The Society for the Diffusion of Useful\r\nKnowledge, founded in 1825, caused to be prepared, and placed at cheap\r\nprices in the hands of the working classes, numerous publications of the\r\nsame general character, but of a higher order, as those of the Chambers;\r\nand it subsequently issued two weekly periodicals, the Penny Magazine\r\nand the Penny Cyclopedia, filled with entertaining knowledge, which\r\ncirculated by thousands through all the workshops of the kingdom, and\r\nhave found their way to the learned rich and the laboring poor on this\r\nside of the ocean. These publications imparted to the common mind of\r\nEngland that knowledge which is power, and, in conjunction with the\r\npolitical press, taught the people the nature and value of their rights,\r\nand inspired them with courage to demand and defend them.\r\n\r\nSo much for periodical literature. Another department of English\r\nletters, more strictly deserving the name of \"Literature,\" which has\r\nrendered powerful aid to the cause of political reform during the\r\npresent century, will be noticed in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\n     The Liberal Literature of\r\n     England--Poetry--Southey--Coleridge--Wordsworth--Burns--Rogers--\r\n     Montgomery--Moore--Campbell--Herbert--Byron--Shelley--Keats--Hunt--\r\n     Pringle--Nicoll--Peter--Barton--Hood--Procter--Tennyson--Milnes--\r\n     Elliott--Horne--Mary Howitt--Eliza Cook--Mackay--Novels--Godwin--\r\n     Holcraft--The Drama--Bage--Scott--Miss Edgeworth--Mrs. Opie--Miss\r\n     Mitford--Mrs. Hall--Miss Martineau--Banim--Lever--Lover--Bulwer--\r\n     Dickens--Essays--Jeffrey--Smith--Brougham--Mackintosh--Macaulay--\r\n     Lamb--Hazlitt--Carlyle--Talfourd--Pamphlets--Holland House--French\r\n     Literature and Louis Philippe.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther notice will now be taken of the liberal literature of England,\r\nafter the French revolution. We can enter only on the borders of this\r\nlarge field. Since the modern \"revival of letters,\" the _Poets_ of\r\nEngland have furnished their quota of friends of Progress and Reform.\r\n\r\nAmong the strange theories concerning the regeneration of mankind, to\r\nwhich the great French convulsion gave birth, was a day-dream of\r\nSouthey, Coleridge, and Lloyd, three young geniuses, then sojourning at\r\nBristol. Having vainly endeavored to make England a republic, by writing\r\na drama on the fall of Robespierre, delivering a course of lectures on\r\nthe French revolution, and publishing two or three seditious pamphlets,\r\nthey proposed to leave the kingdom in disgust, bury themselves in the\r\naboriginal forests on the banks of the Susquehanna, and there erect a\r\n\"Pantisocracy,\" in which property should be held in common, every man be\r\na legislator, and a model democracy be wrought out, that should\r\nconsummate the happiness of its founders, while its reflex influence\r\ncured all the ills of European institutions. Unfortunately for the human\r\nrace, the three poets happened just then to fall in with and fall in\r\nlove with three tempting young Eves of Bristol, the Misses Fricker, one\r\nan actress, one a mantua-maker, and one a school-teacher; and giving up\r\ntheir scheme of regenerating the world, they wisely concluded, with\r\nBenedick, that it was better to people it, and so all got married. Thus\r\nended _their_ \"Much Ado about Nothing.\"\r\n\r\nLloyd sunk into obscurity, Southey atoned for his Susquehanna sins by\r\nspending a long life in hostility to civil and religious freedom, and\r\nColeridge lived and died a moderate friend of liberty and reform.\r\nWordsworth early became acquainted with Coleridge and Southey,\r\nparticipated in their French enthusiasm, and, like them, his first\r\npoetic dreams were of freedom. In one of his earliest productions he\r\nproposes to invoke the restorative aid of the Royal Humane Society in\r\nbehalf of crowned heads, as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"Oh give, great God! to Freedom's waves to ride\r\n  Sublime o'er conquest, avarice, and pride;\r\n  And grant that every sceptered child of clay\r\n  Who cries, presumptuous, 'Here their tides shall stay,'\r\n  Swept in their anger from the affrighted shore,\r\n  With all his creatures sink to rise no more\"\r\n\r\nThrough his long career, the productions of the greatest of the \"Lake\r\nPoets\" have exerted a calm but steady influence in favor of humanity.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Burns appeared, \"whistling at his plouw,\" and teaching\r\nthe world that\r\n\r\n  \"The rank is but the guinea's stamp,\r\n  The man's the gowd for a' that.\"\r\n\r\nHe, too, caught some of his inspiration from France. By force of his\r\ngenius, the Scotch yeoman opened his way to the highest rank of\r\ncotemporary poets, carrying with him the sympathies of the class from\r\nwhich he sprung. No writer is oftener quoted to round a period in a\r\nReform speech. I have seen a meeting of Scotch Chartists go wild with\r\nenthusiasm under the inspiration of one of his songs. The same year that\r\nBurns became an author, Rogers sent his first volume of poems to press,\r\nof whom Lord Brougham, in his Sketch of Grattan, says: \"He is one of the\r\ngreatest poets whom this country has produced, as well as one of its\r\nfinest prose-writers; who to this unstable fame adds the more\r\nimperishable renown of being also one of the most uncompromising friends\r\nof civil and religious liberty who have appeared in any age.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1794, James Montgomery, a name honorably associated with the cause of\r\nhumanity, published in the _Sheffield Iris_, a newspaper edited by him,\r\na ballad on the overthrow of the Bastile, which the Pitt Government saw\r\nfit to regard as a seditious libel. He was prosecuted, convicted,\r\namerced in a fine, and imprisoned three months in York Castle. The next\r\nyear the Government again prosecuted the amiable poet for an analogous\r\noffense, upon which he was again fined and shut up six months at York.\r\nThese persecutions did not quench his zeal for human freedom; and\r\ndespite a most offensive critique in the Edinburgh Review of his first\r\nvolume of poems, he published another in 1807, celebrating the abolition\r\nof the slave trade, which was distinguished for vigor of expression and\r\nrichness of coloring. These, and subsequent publications of kindred\r\ncharacter, have given Montgomery an enduring place in the affections of\r\nChristian philanthropists.\r\n\r\nAt a later period, two poets appeared, who have exerted a wide sway over\r\nthe mind, not of Britain only, but of every land where the English\r\nlanguage is spoken--Moore and Campbell. The political tendency of their\r\nwritings (and it has been considerable) is on the side of freedom.\r\nMoore's father was of the proscribed sect of Irish Catholics, who, in\r\nthe language of the son, \"hailed the first dazzling outbreak of the\r\nFrench revolution as a signal to the slave, wherever suffering, that\r\nthe day of his deliverance was near at hand.\" When Moore was a boy of\r\ntwelve, he sat on the chairman's knee at a celebration in honor of the\r\nrevolution, when this toast was drank, with three times three: \"May the\r\nbreezes of France fan our Irish oak into verdure!\" The poet has lived to\r\nsee the foliage of the oak grow more sere and yellow, though another\r\nbreeze from France has swept its branches. But, in all seasons, and when\r\nmixing in the brilliant revelries of London society, the idol of a\r\ndevoted band of worshipers, he never ceased to love his native island.\r\nHis \"Irish Melodies\" have inspired a strange sympathy in many climes for\r\nhis blighted country, while they have taught Irishmen, in whatever\r\ncorner of the earth they wander, to say--\r\n\r\n  \"Wert thou all that I wish thee--great, glorious, and free--\r\n  First flower of the earth and first gem of the sea\r\n  I might hail thee with prouder, with happier brow,\r\n  But, oh! could I love thee more deeply than now?\"\r\n\r\nCampbell's poetic offerings to the cause of Polish liberty are in the\r\nschool-books of two continents, and have fired the indignation of two\r\ngenerations of youthful orators at that great European felony, the\r\npartition of Poland, when\r\n\r\n  \"Sarmatia fell, unwept, without a crime.\"\r\n\r\nThe heroic struggle for Grecian independence animated the classic soul\r\nof Campbell, and he took an active part in rousing European sentiment in\r\nher behalf. And down to the last moment of his life he was proud to give\r\nhis cordial support to the cause of liberty and humanity in every part\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nWilliam Herbert, a scion of the ancient houses of Pembroke and Percy, is\r\nstill more illustrious as a scholar of rare attainments, and as the\r\nauthor of \"Attila,\" which the Edinburgh Review has declared the most\r\nMiltonic poem since Paradise Lost. Some of his poetic effusions were\r\noffered at the shrine of freedom; and while a member of Parliament, he\r\ncooperated with Wilberforce in the abolition of the slave trade; and\r\nafter withdrawing from politics, and taking holy orders, and reaching\r\nstations of dignity in the Established Church, he gave his influence to\r\nliberal measures, advocating Catholic emancipation and the Reform bill.\r\n\r\nThe wayward genius of Byron, though it uttered much that good morals\r\ncondemn, recorded nothing hostile to political liberty, but, on the\r\ncontrary, something in its favor. On the few occasions that he addressed\r\nthe House of Lords, he advocated the liberal cause, once vindicating in\r\nmanly tones the character and life of Major Cartwright, the father of\r\nParliamentary Reform. The conflict for Grecian independence, in which\r\nByron's last days were spent, throws a broad ray of sunshine across the\r\ndark horizon of his career.\r\n\r\nBut we must dismiss a galaxy of bright names more summarily--some\r\nwithout mentioning them, others by the briefest allusions. Shelley, the\r\nunfortunate, calumniated, generous, and supereminent son of\r\ngenius--Keats, an evanescent being, whose transparent soul was clad too\r\nthin for this prosaic world--Leigh Hunt, the founder of the London\r\n\"Examiner,\" which ought to live forever, and the Italian \"Liberal,\"\r\nwhich ought never to have lived at all, a true son of the Nine, whom\r\nGifford could not kill, though Blackwood Wilson helped him try--Pringle,\r\nwho died at the desk of the Anti-Slavery Society, and whose \"Afar in the\r\nDesert\" Coleridge ranked among the two or three most perfect lyrics in\r\nthe language--Robert Nicoll, a Scotch plowman, an ardent and sincere\r\nradical, who, dying at twenty-three, lived long enough to write \"The Ha'\r\nBible,\" \"We are brethren a',\" and other poems, not unworthy of that\r\nother Scotch Robert who has canonized plowmen-bards--William Peter, now\r\nBritish consul for Pennsylvania, a graceful poet, but better known as a\r\npolitical pupil of the Fox school, a commoner advocating liberal\r\nmeasures, and the biographer of Romilly--Bernard Barton, the friend and\r\ncorrespondent of Lamb, a \"Quaker poet,\" whose effusions show calm\r\nreflection and refined feeling, but have none of the strangely pleasing\r\nblending of the war song of the knight templar with the pastoral ballad\r\nof the mountain shepherd, of Peter the Hermit's crusade-preaching with\r\nVirgil the heathen's classic singing, which give life and beauty to the\r\nlays of _our_ Quaker poet--Hood, the prince of punsters, whose \"Song of\r\nthe Shirt,\" sung in all climes, and imitated on all themes, dignified\r\nsympathy with seamstresses, who toil twenty-four hours for twelve\r\npence--Procter, the Harrow chum of Byron, whose \"Rising of the North,\"\r\n\"The Open Sea,\" and \"Touch us Gently, Time,\" show that Barry Cornwall's\r\nharp can sound at will the highest and deepest, the wildest and the\r\ntenderest notes, and while giving volumes of \"morocco and gilt\" to the\r\nnobility and gentry, sends \"poetry for the people\" through Howitt's\r\nJournal--Tennyson, an inspired singer, whose \"Princess\" is a\r\nreformer--Milnes, who, though a Tory in the House of Commons, always\r\nappeared as a liberal when he entered the Temple of the Muses--Elliott,\r\nwhose Corn-Law Rhymes roused a nation to arms against landlord monopoly,\r\nby kindling sympathy with the poor man's lot, and firing indignation\r\nagainst taxes on his bread--R. H. Horne, a true poet and sterling\r\nreformer, the author of \"Orion,\" the editor of the \"New Spirit of the\r\nAge,\" and a contributor to the People's and Howitt's Journals--Mary\r\nHowitt, whose sex never was permitted to prevent her doing valiant\r\nservice for the right in the battles of freedom with tyranny--Eliza\r\nCook, not unworthy, as a poetess and a reformer, to be associated with\r\nMary Howitt--Mackay, whose prophecy of the \"good time coming\" has been\r\napplauded to the echo by voices that would have smothered in hisses the\r\nsame sentiments if uttered in prose:--these, and a glorious company\r\nbesides, have laid some of the richest gifts, where all genuine poetry\r\nis welcomed, on Freedom's altar.\r\n\r\nIn this summary, only here and there a star has been pointed out in the\r\nbrilliant constellation which has shone in the firmament of freedom,\r\nduring the period we are now glancing over. The catalogue of slavery's\r\npoets is not yet published. It must be rather meager. If the poetry of\r\nliberty is inspired by airs from heaven, the poetry of despotism must\r\nrage in blasts from hell. Dante and Milton have given glowing\r\ndescriptions of Pandemonium, and put splendid diction into the mouths of\r\ndevils; but neither the descriptions nor the diction have won admirers\r\nfor the domicil or its denizens, among the inhabitants of high\r\nlatitudes.\r\n\r\nSome of the _Novelists_ of this period have contributed not a little to\r\nthe cause of political reform.\r\n\r\nWilliam Godwin, one of the remarkable men of the times, is known not\r\nonly as the writer of that extraordinary tale, \"Caleb Williams,\" but of\r\nthe \"Inquiry concerning Political Justice,\" a production whose style is\r\nas vigorous as its doctrines are radical, displaying rare originality\r\nand boldness of conception, and breathing the loftiest aspirations for\r\nthe well-being of man. \"Caleb Williams,\" which appeared soon after the\r\n\"Inquiry,\" was intended to give wider currency to the author's views of\r\nsocial and political reform, by clothing them in the attractive colors\r\nof romance. Had Godwin been an ambitious politician, he might have\r\nplaced himself at the head of a school of reformers. He chose to be a\r\nphilosophical recluse; and in the storm of the French revolution, he\r\nsent out from his retreat breathing thoughts and burning words, that\r\ngave increased life and vigor to the heaving mass of mind around him.\r\nThe friend and counselor of Tooke and Holcroft, he was obnoxious to the\r\nGovernment, but his retired habits saved him from the prosecutions that\r\nperiled the lives of his more active associates. His numerous writings,\r\nlike those of Jeremy Bentham, whom he in some respects strongly\r\nresembled, while in others no two men could be more dissimilar, have\r\nleft abiding impressions on many of the noblest minds of England.\r\n\r\nHolcroft imbibed liberal principles during the time of the French\r\nconvulsions. He was the writer of several successful plays, among which\r\nwas the highly popular \"Road to Ruin.\" He published various novels,\r\nwhich, on account of their political sentiments, attracted much notice.\r\nAs mere romances they belong not to the first rank, the plots and\r\ncharacters being mere frame-work to hold aristocratic doctrines up to\r\nridicule, and democratic principles to admiration. The dialogue is often\r\nlively and piquant, and many of the portraits are skillfully drawn. And\r\nin this connection, it may be said that the dramatists of this period\r\npoured some of their rills of philosophy, wit and satire into the\r\npopular channels. Even Rolla's fustian address to the Peruvians, which\r\nsounds like Sheridan's speeches against Napoleon, always stimulated the\r\ngalleries to a higher pitch of hatred to tyranny. Colman's comedies made\r\nupstart noblemen and pedantic doctors of laws shade their faces, while\r\nthe pit shook its sides with laughter. William Tell launched his arrow\r\nnot in vain at Gesler, for George IV came near being shot in the royal\r\nbox on an occasion when it was played; and Talfourd and Bulwer, in Ion\r\nand the Lady of Lyons, having disguised democracy in classic robes,\r\nintroduced it to the admiration and applause of the dress circle. To\r\nreturn to novelists. Coeval with Holcroft, Robert Bage, a Tamworth\r\nQuaker, not having the fear of George Fox nor the Attorney General\r\nbefore his eyes, published some good political novels. He, like the\r\ndramatist, had caught some of the fire of liberty at the general\r\nconflagration of the old order of things in Europe, and he bore his\r\n\"testimony\" against the bigotry of Guelph and the arrogance of Pitt, in\r\nthe form of romances, which, though they fell below Holcroft's, received\r\nthe imprimatur of Walter Scott, when he included them in his \"Novelist's\r\nLibrary.\"\r\n\r\nThe works of the Godwin, Holcroft and Bage school not only introduced a\r\nnew era in novel writing, by making fiction the medium of communicating\r\nradical opinions, but they aided in evaporating the rose-water style of\r\nromance, which had so diluted the public taste that \"novel\" and\r\n\"insipidity\" had come to be synonymous terms. By and by, the public\r\nappetite was prepared for a more racy and invigorating regimen. Then\r\nappeared the gorgeous but manly and natural historical novels of Scott,\r\ntoo prone to flatter \"blood,\" wealth, and noble lineage, but wearing an\r\nair of the most genial _bonhommie_, and looking with a brotherly eye\r\nupon humanity in its humblest forms. About the time that Scott was\r\nbeginning his Waverley, came the piquant and beautiful stories of Miss\r\nEdgeworth and Mrs. Opie, to be followed by those of Miss Mitford and\r\nMrs. Hall, who, whether painting life and manners in the cottages of the\r\nlowly or the drawing-rooms of the great, place virtue and philanthropy\r\nin the foreground of the picture. At a later period, the philosophic and\r\nbenevolent Miss Martineau, despite the maledictions of the London\r\nQuarterly, admirably succeeded in the till then doubtful experiment of\r\nconveying the principles of politico-economical science to the masses\r\nthrough the medium of tales and sketches. The English Miss Sedgwick\r\ndeserves the thanks of humanity for putting Benthamism into clean purple\r\nand fine linen. Ireland has been prolific in delineators of her\r\nsuffering and crimes, jocularities and bulls, both in poetry and prose.\r\nBanim, the author of the _O'Hara Tales_, and other stories, is the\r\ngreatest of his class. He paints the times of Ninety-Eight in colors so\r\nvivid that the tragedy leaps living from the canvas. In the\r\n_Nonconformist_ he depicts the evils and cruelties of the Catholic penal\r\ncode in figures so graphic and truthful that the veriest bigot can\r\nhardly restrain his indignation at the Protestant oppressors. Lever\r\nplaces in a strong light the blarney and blunders of the Irish, and his\r\nstories generally begin in farce and end in caricature. Lover puts you\r\nat once into good humor; and, whether you read him, or hear him tell his\r\nstories or sing his songs, he makes you love the genuine Irish\r\ncharacter, and you alternately cry and laugh at its miseries and\r\ndrolleries to the end of the volume or ballad. Bulwer's world-read\r\nnovels, attractive to the scholastic mind by their acute analysis of\r\ncharacter, and to the poetic temperament by their deep coloring,\r\nthough, like Byron's poems, they enunciate a good deal of doubtful\r\nethics, drawing no very broad line between the morals of plowmen and\r\nhighwaymen, yet their political tendencies are decidedly towards\r\nliberalism. But the writer of fiction who has done the most in our day\r\nfor his race, is Charles Dickens. He is not merely a novelist, but a\r\nphilanthropist, whose overflowing humanity surpasses even his abounding\r\nhumor. No right-hearted man ever rose from the perusal of Dickens\r\nwithout feeling a deeper affection for human nature, a more cordial\r\ncontempt for cant and hypocrisy, and a holier hatred of cruelty and\r\nmeanness. His Nicholas Nickleby and Oliver Twist have done more to drown\r\nin ridicule and smother in abhorrence the absurd private schools and the\r\ndiabolical parish work-houses of England, than the \"works\" of all the\r\ndidactic authors of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nAnother class of writers have, during the present century, secured a\r\nfirm footing within the pale of English literature--the _Essayists_.\r\nIndeed, at one time, it looked as if the new comers would succeed in\r\nexcluding everybody from it but themselves. At the head of this class\r\nstand the leading contributors of the Edinburgh Review, of whom Mr.\r\nWhipple has aptly said, \"they made reviewing more respectable than\r\nauthorship.\" Jeffrey, for twenty-six years its editor, shed over its\r\npages a strong, steady, and beautiful light, which tempered and\r\nirradiated the whole. His papers are a rare compend of literary\r\ncriticism. Though sometimes more sophistical than philosophical, more\r\nbrilliant than profound, and betraying prejudices when he should\r\nelucidate principles, he was, upon the whole, not unworthy to be called\r\n\"The Prince of Critics.\" For a quarter of a century his fiat was law in\r\nfar the larger portion of the republic of English letters. Since he left\r\nthe throne, many of his canons have been disputed, and some have been\r\ntotally annulled. His contributions to the Review, when published in a\r\nseparate form, appear more homogeneous, more like a \"work,\" than those\r\nof his brethren who have put theirs to press. Sydney Smith bore\r\nundisputed sway in the realm of wit and sarcasm. Papists, prisoners,\r\npoachers, paupers, school-boys, and chimney-sweepers, owe him a monument\r\neach, for he was their very friend; and if the Pennsylvanians repudiate,\r\nnonconformists might purchase a pension for his heirs with the lawn he\r\ntore from the shoulders of \"persecuting bishops.\" Brougham glared from\r\nthe pages of the Review a baleful meteor, striking terror into dunces in\r\nGrub street and charlatans in Downing street, now scorching a poetaster\r\nand then roasting a prime minister, nor quenching his fires till they\r\nhad penetrated and lit up the royal harem of Carlton House and Windsor\r\nCastle. Mackintosh made the Edinburgh the medium for exhibiting to the\r\npublic eye some of those philosophical disquisitions, laden with the\r\nlore of the school-men, and embellished with the graces of the poets,\r\nwhich justified the assertion of Robert Hall, that if he had been less\r\nindolent and discursive, he might have attained the first place amongst\r\nmodern metaphysicians. Macaulay has been one of the chief literary\r\nattractions of the Review for the last eighteen years. His contributions\r\nare no more _criticisms_ than are his descriptions of the state of\r\nEngland in 1685, or his sketch of the death-bed of Charles II, in his\r\nrecent history. True, he places the title of a book at the head of a\r\npage. But his papers have men for their subjects rather than books, are\r\nessays rather than articles, panoramas of events instead of histories,\r\nliving portraits of individuals rather than biographies of the dead.\r\nAccording to the old standards, they would have been more appropriate in\r\nthe history of England than in the Edinburgh Review. But the old\r\nstandards have decayed. They are read and imitated in two hemispheres.\r\nThe scholar admires their learning, the philosopher their penetration,\r\nthe rhetorician their art, the poet their imagery, the million their\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nAnd these five are the greatest of the \"Edinburgh Reviewers.\" Freedom\r\nin every part of the world owes them a heavy debt of gratitude.\r\n\r\nPassing through a brilliant throng of essayists, each man of whom is\r\nworthy of special note, and stopping barely long enough to say of Lamb\r\nthat he is one of the most quaint, humorous, witty, genial, and humane\r\nwriters in the language, and of Hazlitt, that he is a mine of diamonds,\r\nall rich and disorderly, brilliant and cutting, but of the first water,\r\nwe approach with no little awe and diffidence the strange but not\r\nstranger Thomas Carlyle, \"a writer of books.\" He has done yoeman service\r\nin the conflict with \"shams,\" and has made the bankrupt institutions of\r\nEngland echo their own hollowness, under the heavy blows of his German\r\ntruncheon. The obscurity of his style is often alleged against him. In\r\nmany passages, an interlined translation, or a glossary, would be\r\nconvenient. But, he is readily understood by those familiar with his\r\nfanciful mode of backing up to a question, rather than going straight\r\nforward to it. His defects seem to lie deeper than the obscurities of\r\nhis rhetoric. They pierce through words to things. A vein of profound\r\nreflection pervades much of his writing. But no inconsiderable portion\r\nof it is indebted to his style for its seeming profundity. Straighten\r\nsome of his crooked sentences, which, _prima facie_, seem to embrace in\r\ntheir sinuosities some great idea too awful to be uttered in plain\r\nSaxon, and thus, as it were, having thrown out the meaning, lo, the\r\nmatter turns out to be rather commonplace. This is not his worst fault;\r\nfor no author is bound to be always saying original or profound things,\r\nand he may be excused sometimes for wrapping up a common idea in\r\nsuperfine clothing. As a writer on social and political evils--his\r\nchosen field--Carlyle whelms the reader deeper and deeper in the abyss\r\nof wide-weltering wrong--_and there leaves him_. He points out no way of\r\nescape; suggests no remedies. Read his \"Chartism,\" his \"Past and\r\nPresent,\" his article in a recent Spectator on \"Ireland and Sir Robert\r\nPeel\"--and what then? He gives you clearly to understand that the\r\ngovernmental machine is sadly out of gear--that Poor-Laws are a \"sham,\"\r\nand Emigration a delusion--that the \"_sans-potato_ Irish\" are rotting\r\nunder bad rule--but what then? Why, so far as Mr. Carlyle tells you,\r\n_Nothing!_ Rot to all eternity, for aught he proposes by way of remedy.\r\nHis writings abound in hearty expressions of dissatisfaction with\r\nexisting things; in vivid pictures of human suffering, more graphic than\r\nlimner ever drew, more startling than poet ever painted; but, trusting\r\nto him, you look in vain for any relief, either for your own excited\r\nfeelings, or for the pitiable objects in whose behalf he has aroused\r\nyour sympathies. He leads you into a foul morass, tells you it is a\r\n\"sham,\" and as you sink out of sight, surrounded by a mass of smothering\r\nhumanity, he cries, \"God help you,\" mounts some transcendental crotchet,\r\nand soars into the clouds. It is suspected that Carlyle has a theoretic\r\nremedy for bad government, but dislikes to disclose it. He has no faith\r\nin Toryism, Whigism, Liberalism, or Radicalism. To him, they are \"shams\r\nall.\" If he belongs to any school, it would seem to be the absolute. He\r\ndon't believe in the divine right of kings, though he holds that some\r\nmen are born to command. Nor would he give the governed the right of\r\nselecting their commander. He recognizes a sort of intellectual and\r\nmoral \"might,\" the possession of which confers the \"right\" to govern.\r\nThe abstract theory may be good; the difficulty is in reducing it to the\r\nconcrete. Who is to decide as to the possession of the \"might?\"\r\nJefferson would refer the decision to the governed; Nichols would leave\r\nit to the accidents of royal procreation; Carlyle says it belongs\r\nto----who knows what he says? He is a great \"Hero\"-worshiper, and a good\r\nmany of his \"Heroes\" have been splendid tyrants. He despises imbecility,\r\nbut idolizes power. His rather obscure chapter in \"Chartism\" on \"Rights\r\nand Mights\" can, with little effort, be turned into a special plea for\r\nabsolutism. His eulogistic essay, in the Foreign Quarterly, on Dr.\r\nFrancia, \"the Perpetual Dictator of the Republic of Paraguay,\" seems to\r\ndisclose the kind of government and governor he glories in. Francia was\r\na man of intellect and decision, and he was a despot. He erected a\r\n\"workman's gallows,\" to terrify and hang laborers who failed to do their\r\nwork well--a \"not unbeneficial institution,\" says Carlyle. A poor\r\nshoemaker made some belts for the Dictator's grenadiers. He did not like\r\nthe sample shown to him, though the shoemaker \"had done his best.\"\r\nFrancia ordered a rope about the neck of the trembling wretch, calling\r\nhim \"a most impertinent scoundrel,\" (a \"very favorite word of the\r\nDictator's,\" says Carlyle,) and had him marched back and forth under the\r\ngallows, in the momentary expectation of being hung. He was at length\r\nreleased, half dead with terror. Carlyle remarks upon this, in plain\r\nEnglish, (his admiration for the scene is too intense for a crooked\r\nsentence,) that the shoemaker worked with such alacrity all night, that\r\nhis belts on the morrow were without a parallel in South America. The\r\nwhole story, drawn out through a page, shows that Francia was a brute;\r\nas, indeed, does the whole article in the Quarterly. Carlyle gloats over\r\nhim with wild enthusiasm. But, it is often neither just nor generous to\r\nmeasure others by our own standards. Every man has his _forte_, his\r\nmission. Carlyle's may be to point out existing evils, while leaving it\r\nto time and plain men to suggest remedies. His gigantic soul sits\r\nenshrouded, to common eyes, in clouds. To his own, it may bask in\r\nsunshine. Honest, humane, mystic, magnificent, the world cannot spare\r\nthe great mind of the age, whose calling seems to be to set smaller\r\nminds in motion. Long live this \"Writer of Books.\"\r\n\r\nTo relieve the picture, let us glance at the anti-counterpart of\r\nCarlyle--Thomas Noon Talfourd. He is one of the brightest and purest\r\nspecimens of the _literati_ of England. A lawyer, a poet, a dramatist,\r\nan orator, a statesman, an essayist, he has succeeded in each of these\r\nvaried departments. The instances are not unfrequent in which persons\r\nhave attained a high place both in politics and literature. Instances\r\nof marked success both in law and literature are extremely rare. The\r\nmost striking English examples of the attainment of eminence by the same\r\nindividual in the profession of law and the cultivation of literature,\r\nare Jeffrey, Brougham, and Talfourd. The latter has achieved this by the\r\nversatility and elasticity of his genius, unaided by the accidents of\r\nbirth, family, or wealth. There is a magnetic philosophy, a classical\r\nwitchery, an intoxicating enthusiasm, about his literary productions,\r\nthat make him one of the most attractive and delightful of authors. As a\r\nlawyer, he is at home in the grave and studied discussions at _banc_,\r\nand in the showy and extemporaneous contests at _nisi prius_. His\r\ndefense of Moxon, the poet bookseller, so foolishly and scandalously\r\nprosecuted, a few years ago, for publishing the works of Shelley, was a\r\nsplendid vindication of the right of genius to conceive, and enterprise\r\nto print, some of the rarest productions of the century. His rhetoric,\r\nin the quiet retreat of letters, and his eloquence in the bustling road\r\nof politics, have been employed to instruct, delight and elevate his\r\nfellow-men.\r\n\r\nThere is a department of writing, not yet dignified with the title of\r\n\"Literature,\" which exerts an influence over popular sentiment, second\r\nonly to that of the weekly and daily press. It is peculiarly the\r\noffspring of this age, and bears the strong lineaments of its parent. I\r\nwill call it the _Literature of Occasional Pamphlets_. In England, the\r\nCatholic Controversy, Parliamentary Reform, Negro Slavery, Chartism, the\r\nCorn Laws, Church and State, General Education, and all those questions\r\nwhich have moved and do move the nation, have called out a mass of such\r\nliterature, which, in intrinsic ability and artistic excellence, will\r\nbear comparison with any cotemporaneous branch of writing. In that\r\ncountry, and more especially in this, he who does not stock his library\r\nwith volumes of selected pamphlets excludes from it some of the most\r\nvaluable literature of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nI cannot close this imperfect view of the liberal literature of\r\nEngland, without a brief allusion to the peculiar but powerful aid\r\nrendered to it by the late Lord Holland. The nephew of Fox inherited\r\nmuch of the eloquence, all the democracy, and more than all the love for\r\nlearning and the fine arts, of his illustrious uncle. For a third of a\r\ncentury, which carried England forward a hundred years in the path of\r\nimprovement, \"Holland House\" was the center of attraction for liberal\r\nstatesmen, orators, poets, painters, wits, and scholars. Mingling in the\r\nbrilliant throngs that so often filled its gorgeous drawing-rooms,\r\nelegant picture-galleries, and ample libraries, were to be seen\r\nstatesmen who guided Cabinets, and orators who swayed Senates; men of\r\nletters who had reached the hights of human knowledge, and modest genius\r\njust struggling into notice; poets reposing under the shadow of their\r\nfame, and poets just plucking their first laurel-leaf; sculptors who had\r\nengraven life in the marble, and painters who had impressed beauty on\r\nthe canvas; the writer of the first article in the last Edinburgh, and\r\nthe author of the best comedy then acting at Drury-Lane; here a Whig\r\nDuke with a long title and a landed air, and there a Radical Editor\r\nunder indictment for a seditious libel on the Government; the Duchess of\r\nSutherland shedding grace around this circle, and Mrs. Opie diffusing\r\nbenevolence around that; Buxton, the brewer, discoursing on Prison\r\nDiscipline with Bentham, the philosopher; Brougham explaining to a\r\nPolish refugee his plan for educating the people, while Moore delighted\r\na bevy of belles by singing his last Irish melody; Sydney Smith\r\nenlivening this alcove with his humor, and Mackintosh enlightening that\r\nwith his learning--all these varied and diverse elements meeting on\r\nterms of social equality, and impressing upon the literary mind of the\r\ncountry the all-influential lesson, that, so far from losing caste by\r\nembracing liberal political opinions, the man of letters, of science,\r\nand of art, might find the profession of that faith a passport to\r\ncircles where fashion displayed its smiles and power dispensed its\r\nfavors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\n     Conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing chapters, I have endeavored to trace the rise and\r\nprogress of the GREAT BRITISH PARTY OF REFORM, which, adopting such\r\nchanges in principle and policy as experience may suggest, will live and\r\ngrow till every man has a voice in the election of both branches of the\r\nLegislature that governs him--till the burdens of taxation are\r\nimpartially distributed among the people--till the sinecure and pension\r\nrolls are destroyed--till the public debt is paid or repudiated--till\r\nthe main reliance for home defense rests with an organized militia--till\r\nthe marine of a free commerce has chased the \"wooden walls\" from the\r\nocean--till traffic in the land is as free as in the wheat it\r\ngrows--till labor, fairly paid, becomes labor duly respected--till every\r\nsect supports its own church and clergy, and none other--till common\r\nschools, drawing nourishment from the bosom of the State, nestle in\r\nevery valley--till the precepts of the law are made plain, and its\r\nadmistration cheap--till Ireland becomes independent, or is allowed her\r\njust share in the national councils--till the dogma that a favored few\r\nare born booted and spurred, to ride the masses \"by the grace of God,\"\r\nhas had its last day, and the England of the times \"when George the\r\nThird was King\" exists only in the chronicles of History.\r\n\r\nSince these Sketches were commenced, Europe has been the theater of a\r\nseries of revolutions and counter-revolutions. France rose, overthrew\r\nthe Monarchy, and expelled Louis Philippe. In an evil hour, she thrust\r\naside Lamartine, to make room for Louis Napoleon. Ireland, having made\r\nan attempt to break her chains, has fallen into the arms of despair.\r\nAustria and Prussia kindled a flame which, for a time, gladdened the eye\r\nof Liberty. The expiring embers have been trodden out by the hoof of the\r\nCossack. Rome expelled her Dictator, and founded a Republic more\r\nglorious and free than that of antiquity. She died under assassin blows\r\ndealt across the Alps by a professedly fraternal hand. Hungary made a\r\nstand for Freedom which electrified the world. Her immortal Kossuth and\r\nBem have been compelled to flee to the mountains, while the hordes of\r\nRussia lay waste her plains, and Austria, the meanest of despots, rivets\r\nchains on the limbs of her sons. From this dark and dreary prospect, the\r\neye turns to the Radical Reformers of Great Britain and Ireland. Acting\r\nthrough institutions comparatively free, they will by slow but sure\r\nadvances yet work out for themselves, and, by the aid of kindred spirits\r\nin other countries, for Europe, the great problem of Constitutional\r\nliberty. In the present aspect of Continental affairs, they, with the\r\nRadical Republicans of France, must be regarded as the rallying point,\r\nthe forlorn hope of the struggling masses from the Gulf of Finland to\r\nthe Straits of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note: Obvious punctuation and printer errors have been\r\nsilently normalized.
