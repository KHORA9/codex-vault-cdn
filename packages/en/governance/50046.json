As he was entitled to a part of the money he had received, and it\r\nwas reasonable to suppose he must have been living here on that resource,\r\nso that he could not be expected to pay the whole sum received, I desired\r\nhim to state his account against that fund as he thought just himself, to\r\npay me the balance on account, reserving to you a full right to discuss\r\nthe propriety of his charges, and to allow or disallow them as you\r\npleased, so that nothing that passed between us, should either strengthen\r\nor weaken his claims. He accordingly rendered me the account which I\r\nnow enclose, balance 112, 172_l._ 2-4. He desired me at the same time to\r\nforward to you the papers, No. 1-12, which will show the objections and\r\ndifficulties he had to encounter, and which could have been obviated by\r\nnobody else. There certainly was no other person whose knowledge of the\r\ntransactions so well qualified them to negotiate this business, and I do\r\nsuppose that this fund would have lost some of its capital articles in any\r\nother hands. This circumstance, with the real value of this officer, will,\r\nI doubt not, have their just influence in settling his claims. There is\r\nno doubt but that he has actually expended the money charged to have been\r\nexpended. Without this supply, Mr. Grand would have been in advance for\r\nthe United States, according to a rough estimate which I made, 42, 281_l._\r\n61_s._, besides 24, 437_l._ 11_s._, which, on the failure of the federal\r\nfunds here, and being apprised of Mr. Grand's advances, I had ventured to\r\norder him to take from a sum of money lodged in his hands for the State\r\nof Virginia for the purchase of arms. This liberty was taken in order\r\nthat he might honor the draughts of Mr. Carmichael and Mr. Dumas, pay\r\ncertain foreign officers who had not yet been paid _pari passu_ with their\r\nbrother officers, and answer my demand also. These two sums amounting to\r\n66, 719_l._ 7_s._, were first to be replaced, and left a balance of 45,\r\n452_l._ 15, 8_s._ Though you had proposed to leave this in my hands for\r\nthe calls of diplomatic establishments in Europe, I ventured to have it\r\npaid with the residue of the mass into Mr. Grand's hands, to avoid giving\r\nhim umbrage and lessening his dispositions to advance hereafter, and also\r\nbecause it would have been very insecure in my house which stands on the\r\noutline of the city, separated from all others by a considerable interval,\r\nand therefore exposed to robbery. The insurance in this situation would\r\nhave been worth much more than Mr. Grand's commission on it. From this\r\ndetail, you will perceive that there remains on hand about enough to\r\nanswer the demands of the diplomatic establishments in France, Spain,\r\nEngland and Holland for a quarter of a year from this date, which I have\r\ninstructed Mr. Grand to apply solely to that purpose.\r\n\r\nCommodore Jones will set out shortly for Copenhagen to settle the demand\r\nagainst that Court, which done, he will return to America to close the\r\nmatters which have been confided to him.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the highest esteem and respect, gentlemen,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAWKINS.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, August 13, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of June the 14th, is come to hand, and I am to thank\r\nyou for your attention to my queries on the subject of the Indians. I have\r\nsent many copies to other correspondents, but as yet have heard nothing\r\nfrom them. I shall proceed, however, in my endeavors, particularly with\r\nrespect to their language, and shall take care so to dispose of what I\r\ncollect thereon, as that it shall not be lost. The attention which you\r\npay to their rights, also, does you great honor, as the want of that is a\r\nprincipal source of dishonor to the American character. The two principles\r\non which our conduct towards the Indians should be founded, are justice\r\nand fear. After the injuries we have done them, they cannot love us, which\r\nleaves us no alternative but that of fear to keep them from attacking\r\nus. But justice is what we should never lose sight of, and in time it\r\nmay recover their esteem. Your attention to one burthen I laid on you,\r\nencourages me to remind you of another, which is the sending me some of\r\nthe seeds of the Dionæa Muscipula, or Venus fly-trap, called also with\r\nyou, I believe, the Sensitive Plant. This can come folded in a letter.\r\nEurope is in a profound calm. The Venetians, Russians and Austrians,\r\nindeed, are pecking at the Turks, but I suppose it is only to keep alive\r\npretensions which may authorize the commencement of hostilities when it\r\nshall suit them. Whether this will be immediately on the death of the King\r\nof Prussia, or some time after, cannot be said. That event may be daily\r\nexpected. It seems as if this Court did not fear a land war, and they are\r\npossessed of the best materials of judging. My reason for thinking they\r\ndo not expect a disturbance of their tranquillity on this Continent is,\r\nthat their whole attention is bestowed on marine preparations. Their navy\r\nis growing, and the practicability of building a seaport is no longer\r\nproblematical. Cherbourg will certainly be completed; it will be one of\r\nthe safest and most commodious ports in the world, and will contain the\r\nwhole navy of France. It will have the advantage over the English ports\r\non the opposite shore, because they leave two openings, which will admit\r\nvessels to come in or go out with any wind. This port will enable them in\r\ncase of a war with England, to invade that country, or to annihilate its\r\ncommerce, and of course its marine. Probably, too, it will oblige them to\r\nkeep a standing army of considerable magnitude. We are tolerably certain\r\nof establishing peace with the Emperor of Morocco, but Algiers, Tunis and\r\nTripoli will still be hostile. Morocco, however, lying on the Atlantic,\r\nwas the most important. The Algerines rarely come far into that, and Tunis\r\nand Tripoli never. We must consider the Mediterranean as absolutely shut\r\nto us till we can open it with money. Whether this will be best expended\r\nin buying or forcing a peace is for Congress to determine. I shall be glad\r\noften to hear from you, and am, with much esteem, dear Sir, your friend\r\nand servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, August 13, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The enclosed letter from Mr. Barclay, and one from Mr. Carmichael,\r\nof which I send you extracts, are come to hand this morning, which is in\r\ntime for them to go by the same gentleman who carries my letter of the\r\n11th. I observe what Mr. Carmichael says on the subject of the Portuguese\r\ntreaty, and am sorry it meets with difficulties. I doubt, however, whether\r\nhe ascribes them to their true cause, when he supposes they are occasioned\r\nby M. del Pinto's being of a party opposed to that of their minister at\r\nMadrid. The cause is not proportioned to the effect. The treaty between\r\nFrance and England has lately been thought to have become stationary.\r\nThis is conjectured from the rigor of the custom-houses, much increased\r\nby late orders, as also from some other circumstances. The overtures\r\nbetween England and Portugal are animated in proportion, and in the same\r\ndegree, I suspect that the latter lessens her care about us. If her wines\r\nwere to become superfluous at the English market, she wished and hoped to\r\nfind a great one with us open, to receive them. M. del Pinto's courier,\r\nwhich carried the treaty to Falmouth, arrived a few hours too late for the\r\nLisbon packet-boat. This lost a month in the conveyance, and that month,\r\nby producing new prospects, has been critical. There is not a want of\r\nprobability that del Pinto himself will succeed the deceased minister in\r\nPortugal. This would be favorable to our treaty, and fortunate for us in\r\nproportion to the value of a connection with that nation. He is sensible,\r\ncandid, and has just ideas as to us, and favorable dispositions toward\r\nus. I expect that Mr. Adams is at this moment at the Hague, as he intended\r\nthere to take leave of that Court, and, at the same time, to exchange the\r\nratification of the Prussian treaty. But I send on to London copies of\r\nthe enclosed, in hopes he will speedily be returned there. I shall propose\r\nto him that we consider whether the conduct of the Dey of Algiers leaves\r\nany hope that any negotiator whatever could obtain his peace without a\r\nprodigious addition to the price we had thought of? If we conclude on\r\nthe negative, still it will remain to decide whether the expense of Mr.\r\nBarclay's going there may not be compensated by additional information,\r\nby the possibility that he might find their ultimatum, and the advantage\r\nof relieving the mind of Congress from all suspense by possessing them of\r\nthis ultimatum. The peace of Spain, too, being concluded, it is to be seen\r\nwhether their interference can weigh as money. It has done so at Morocco.\r\nBut Algiers is a fiercer power.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest respect and esteem,\r\nSir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. WYTHE.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, August 13, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR.--Your favors of January the 10th and February the 10th, came to\r\nhand on the 20th and 23d of May. I availed myself of the first opportunity\r\nwhich occurred, by a gentleman going to England, of sending to Mr. Joddrel\r\na copy of the Notes on our country, with a line informing him, that it\r\nwas you who had emboldened me to take that liberty. Madison, no doubt,\r\ninformed you of the reason why I had sent only a single copy to Virginia.\r\nBeing assured by him, that they will not do the harm I had apprehended,\r\nbut on the contrary, may do some good, I propose to send thither the\r\ncopies remaining on hand, which are fewer than I had intended. But, of the\r\nnumerous corrections they need, there are one or two so essential, that I\r\nmust have them made, by printing a few new leaves, and substituting them\r\nfor the old. This will be done while they are engraving a map which I have\r\nconstructed, of the country from Albemarle sound to Lake Erie, and which\r\nwill be inserted in the book. A bad French translation which is getting\r\nout here, will probably oblige me to publish the original more freely;\r\nwhich it did not deserve, nor did I intend. Your wishes, which are laws to\r\nme, will justify my destining a copy for you, otherwise I should as soon\r\nhave thought of sending you a horn-book; for there is no truth in it which\r\nis not familiar to you, and its errors I should hardly have proposed to\r\ntreat you with.\r\n\r\nImmediately on the receipt of your letter, I wrote to a correspondent\r\nat Florence to inquire after the family of Tagliaferro, as you desired.\r\nI received his answer two days ago, a copy of which I now enclose.\r\nThe original shall be sent by some other occasion. I will have the\r\ncopper-plate immediately engraved. This may be ready within a few days,\r\nbut the probability is, that I shall be long getting an opportunity of\r\nsending it to you, as these rarely occur. You do not mention the size\r\nof the plate, but presuming it is intended for labels for the inside of\r\nbooks, I shall have it made of a proper size for that. I shall omit the\r\nword _agisos_, according to the license you allow me, because I think the\r\nbeauty of a motto is, to condense such matter in as few words as possible.\r\nThe word omitted will be supplied by every reader.\r\n\r\nThe European papers have announced, that the Assembly of Virginia were\r\noccupied on the revisal of their code of laws. This, with some other\r\nsimilar intelligence, has contributed much to convince the people of\r\nEurope, that what the English papers are constantly publishing of our\r\nanarchy, is false; as they are sensible that such a work is that of a\r\npeople only, who are in perfect tranquillity. Our act for freedom of\r\nreligion is extremely applauded. The ambassadors and ministers of the\r\nseveral nations of Europe, resident at this court, have asked of me copies\r\nof it, to send to their sovereigns, and it is inserted at full length in\r\nseveral books now in the press; among others, in the new Encyclopedie. I\r\nthink it will produce considerable good even in these countries, where\r\nignorance, superstition, poverty, and oppression of body and mind, in\r\nevery form, are so firmly settled on the mass of the people, that their\r\nredemption from them can never be hoped. If all the sovereigns of Europe\r\nwere to set themselves to work, to emancipate the minds of their subjects\r\nfrom their present ignorance and prejudices, and that, as zealously as\r\nthey now endeavor the contrary, a thousand years would not place them on\r\nthat high ground, on which our common people are now setting out. Ours\r\ncould not have been so fairly placed under the control of the common sense\r\nof the people, had they not been separated from their parent stock, and\r\nkept from contamination, either from them, or the other people of the\r\nold world, by the intervention of so wide an ocean. To know the worth of\r\nthis, one must see the want of it here. I think by far the most important\r\nbill in our whole code, is that for the diffusion of knowledge among the\r\npeople. No other sure foundation can be devised, for the preservation\r\nof freedom and happiness. If anybody thinks that kings, nobles, or\r\npriests are good conservators of the public happiness, send him here.\r\nIt is the best school in the universe to cure him of that folly. He\r\nwill see here, with his own eyes, that these descriptions of men are an\r\nabandoned confederacy against the happiness of the mass of the people.\r\nThe omnipotence of their effect cannot be better proved, than in this\r\ncountry particularly, where, notwithstanding the finest soil upon earth,\r\nthe finest climate under heaven, and a people of the most benevolent, the\r\nmost gay and amiable character of which the human form is susceptible;\r\nwhere such a people, I say, surrounded by so many blessings from nature,\r\nare loaded with misery, by kings, nobles, and priests, and by them alone.\r\nPreach, my dear Sir, a crusade against ignorance; establish and improve\r\nthe law for educating the common people. Let our countrymen know, that\r\nthe people alone can protect us against these evils, and that the tax\r\nwhich will be paid for this purpose, is not more than the thousandth\r\npart of what will be paid to kings, priests and nobles, who will rise\r\nup among us if we leave the people in ignorance. The people of England,\r\nI think, are less oppressed than here. But it needs but half an eye to\r\nsee, when among them, that the foundation is laid in their dispositions\r\nfor the establishment of a despotism. Nobility, wealth, and pomp, are the\r\nobjects of their admiration. They are by no means the free-minded people\r\nwe suppose them in America. Their learned men, too, are few in number,\r\nand are less learned, and infinitely less emancipated from prejudice,\r\nthan those of this country. An event, too, seems to be preparing, in the\r\norder of things, which will probably decide the fate of that country. It\r\nis no longer doubtful, that the harbor of Cherbourg will be complete,\r\nthat it will be a most excellent one, and capacious enough to hold the\r\nwhole navy of France. Nothing has ever been wanting to enable this country\r\nto invade that, but a naval force conveniently stationed to protect the\r\ntransports. This change of situation must oblige the English to keep up a\r\ngreat standing army, and there is no King, who, with sufficient force, is\r\nnot always ready to make himself absolute. My paper warns me it is time to\r\nrecommend myself to the friendly recollection of Mrs. Wythe, of Colonel\r\nTagliaferro and his family, and particularly of Mr. R. T.; and to assure\r\nyou of the affectionate esteem with which I am, dear Sir, your friend and\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. FRANKLIN.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, August 14, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received your favor of March 20th, and much satisfaction\r\nfrom it. I had been alarmed with the general cry that our commerce was in\r\ndistress, and feared it might be for the want of markets. But the high\r\nprice of commodities shows that markets are not wanting. Is it not yet\r\npossible, however, that these high prices may proceed from the smallness\r\nof the quantity made, and that from the want of laborers? It would really\r\nseem as if we did not make produce enough for home consumption, and, of\r\ncourse, had none superfluous to exchange for foreign articles. The price\r\nof wheat, for instance, shows it is not exported, because it could not, at\r\nsuch a price, enter into competition at a foreign market with the wheat of\r\nany other nation.\r\n\r\nI send you some packets which have been put into my hands to be forwarded\r\nto you. I cannot send your Encyclopedie by the same conveyance, because it\r\nis by the way of England. Nothing worth reading has come from the press,\r\nI think, since you left us. There are one or two things to be published\r\nsoon, which being on the subject of America, may be grateful to you, and\r\nshall be sent.\r\n\r\nEurope enjoys a perfect repose at present. Venice and the two empires seem\r\nto be pecking at the Turks, but only in such a degree as may keep alive\r\ncertain pretensions for commencing war when they shall see the occasion\r\nfit. Whether this will be immediately on the death of the King of Prussia\r\nremains to be seen. That event must happen soon. By the little attention\r\npaid by this country to their land army, it would seem as if they did not\r\napprehend a war on that element. But to the increase and arrangement of\r\ntheir navy, they are very attentive. There is no longer a doubt but that\r\nthe harbor of Cherbourg will be completed, will be a most excellent one,\r\nand capable of containing the whole navy of France. By having two outlets,\r\nvessels may enter and sally with every wind, while in the opposite ports\r\nof England particular winds are necessary. Our peace with Morocco is\r\nprobably signed by this time. We are indebted for it to the court of\r\nSpain. Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli, will continue hostile according to\r\npresent appearances.\r\n\r\nYour friends here, within the circle of my acquaintance, are well, and\r\noften enquire after you. No interesting change that I recollect has taken\r\nplace among them. Houdon has just received the block of marble for General\r\nWashington's statue. He is married since his return. Trumbul, our young\r\nAmerican painter, is come here to have his Death of Montgomery and Battle\r\nof Bunker's Hill engraved. I will beg leave to place here my friendly\r\nrespects to young Mr. Franklin, and assurances of the esteem and regard\r\nwith which I have the honor to be, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL HUMPHREYS.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, August 14, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you on the 7th of May, being immediately on my\r\nreturn from England, and have lately received your favor of June 5th,\r\nand thank you for the intelligence it contains. Every circumstance we\r\nhear induces us to believe that it is the want of will, rather than of\r\nability, to furnish contributions which keeps the public treasury so poor.\r\nThe Algerines will probably do us the favor to produce a sense of the\r\nnecessity of a public treasury and a public force on that element where\r\nit can never be dangerous. They refused even to speak on the subject of\r\npeace. That with Morocco I expect is signed before this time; for which we\r\nare much indebted to Spain.\r\n\r\nYour friend, Mr. Trumbul, is here at present. He brought his Bunker's\r\nHill and Death of Montgomery to have them engraved here. He was yesterday\r\nto see the King's collection of painting at Versailles, and confesses\r\nit surpasses everything of which he even had an idea. I persuaded him to\r\nstay and study here, and then proceed to Rome. Europe is yet quiet, and\r\nso will remain probably till the death of the King of Prussia, which is\r\nconstantly expected. Whether this will be the signal for war or not, is\r\nyet to be seen. The two empires and Venice keep alive certain pretensions\r\nwhich may give color to the commencement of hostilities when they shall\r\nthink the occasion good. This country is much more intent on sea, than\r\non land preparations. Their harbor of Cherbourg will be completed and\r\nwill hold their whole navy. This is putting the bridle into the mouth of\r\nEngland. The affairs of the United Netherlands have so long threatened\r\ncivil war, that one ceases almost to believe any appearances. It must\r\nbe confessed they cannot be stronger. Your friends here are well. La\r\nComtesse d'Houditot asks kindly after you. The public papers continue\r\nto say favorable and just things of your poem. A violent criticism of\r\nChastellux's voyages is just appearing. It is not yet to be bought. I am\r\nlaboring hard with the assistance of M. de La Fayette to get the general\r\ncommerce of the United States with this country put on a favorable\r\nfooting, and am not without hopes. The Marquis is gone into Auvergne for\r\nthe summer. The rest of the beau monde are also vanished for the season.\r\nWe give and receive them you know in exchange for the swallows. I shall be\r\nhappy to hear from you often, and to hear that you are engaged usefully to\r\nyour country and agreeably to yourself, being with the most real esteem,\r\ndear Sir, your sincere friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE WARVILLE.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, August 15, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have read with very great satisfaction the sheets of your work on\r\nthe commerce of France and the United States, which you were so good as to\r\nput into my hands. I think you treat the subject, as far as these sheets\r\ngo, in an excellent manner. Were I to select any particular passages as\r\ngiving me particular satisfaction, it would be those wherein you prove\r\nto the United States that they will be more virtuous, more free and more\r\nhappy, employed in agriculture, than as carriers or manufacturers. It\r\nis a truth, and a precious one for them, if they could be persuaded of\r\nit. I am also particularly pleased with your introductions. You have\r\nproperly observed that we can no longer be called Anglo-Americans. That\r\nappellation now describes only the inhabitants of Nova Scotia, Canada,\r\n&c. I had applied that of Federo Americans to our citizens, as it would\r\nnot be so decent for us to assume to ourselves the flattering appellation\r\nof free Americans. There are two passages in this work on which I am\r\nable to give information. The first is in page 62; \"ils auront le caton\r\nquand ils voudront se leiver à cegenre de culturé,\" and the note \"l'on\r\nvoit dans la Eaie de Massachusetts.\" The four southernmost States make\r\na great deal of cotton. Their poor are almost entirely clothed in it in\r\nwinter and summer. In winter they wear shirts of it, and outer clothing\r\nof cotton and wool mixed. In summer their shirts are linen, but the outer\r\nclothing cotton. The dress of the women is almost entirely of cotton\r\nmanufactured by themselves, except the richer class, and even many of\r\nthese wear a good deal of home-spun cotton. It is as well manufactured\r\nas the calicoes of Europe. Those four States furnish a great deal of\r\ncotton to the States north of them, who cannot make it, as being too\r\ncold. There is no neighborhood in any part of the United States without\r\na water-grist mill for grinding the corn of the neighborhood. Virginia,\r\nMaryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, New York, abound with large\r\nmanufacturing mills for the exportation of flour. There are abundance\r\nof saw-mills in all the States. Furnaces and forges of iron, I believe,\r\nin every State, I know they are in the nine northernmost. There are\r\nmany mills for plating and slitting iron. And I think there are many\r\ndistilleries of rum from Norfolk, in Virginia, to Portsmouth, in New\r\nHampshire. I mention these circumstances because your note seems to imply\r\nthat these things are only in the particular States you mention.\r\n\r\nThe second passage is pages 101 and 102, where you speak of the \"ravages\r\ncausés par l'abus des eaux de vie,\" which seems, by the note in page 101,\r\nto be taken on authority of Smith. Nothing can be less true than what that\r\nauthor says on this subject; and we may say in general that there are as\r\nmany falsehoods as facts in his work. I think drunkenness is much more\r\ncommon in all the American States than in France. But it is less common\r\nthere than in England. You may form an idea from this of the state of it\r\nin America. Smith saw everything through the medium of strong prejudice.\r\nBesides this, he does not hesitate to write palpable lies, which he was\r\nconscious were such. When you proceed to form your table of American\r\nexports and imports, I make no doubt you will consult the American\r\nTraveller, the estimates in which are nearer the truth than those of Lord\r\nSheffield and Deane, as far as my knowledge of the facts enables me to\r\njudge. I must beg your pardon for having so long detained these sheets. I\r\ndid not finish my American despatches till the night before last, and was\r\nobliged yesterday to go to Versailles. I have the honor to be, with very\r\ngreat respect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BARON BLOME.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, August 18, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Dr. Franklin, during his residence at this court, was instructed by\r\nCongress to apply to the court of Denmark for a compensation for certain\r\nvessels and cargoes taken from the English during the late war by the\r\nAmerican squadron under the command of Commodore Paul Jones, carried into\r\na port of Denmark, and by order of the court of Denmark, re-delivered\r\nto the English. Dr. Franklin made the application through the Baron de\r\nWaltersdorff, at that time charged with other matters relative to the\r\ntwo countries of Denmark and the United States of America. Baron de\r\nWaltersdorff, after having written to his court, informed Dr. Franklin\r\nthat he was authorized to offer a compensation of ten thousand guineas.\r\nThis was declined, because it was thought that the value of the prizes\r\nwas the true measure of compensation, and that that ought to be inquired\r\ninto. Baron de Waltersdorff left this court sometime after, on a visit\r\nonly, as he expected, to Copenhagen, and the matter was suffered to rest\r\ntill his return. This was constantly expected till you did me the honor\r\nof informing me that he had received another destination. It being now,\r\ntherefore, necessary to renew our application, it is thought better\r\nthat Commodore Paul Jones should repair in person to Copenhagen. His\r\nknowledge of the whole transaction will best enable him to represent it\r\nto that court, and the world has had too many proofs of the justice and\r\nmagnanimity of his Danish majesty to leave a doubt that he will order full\r\njustice to be done to those brave men who saw themselves deprived of the\r\nspoils, won by their gallantry, and at the hazard of their lives, and on\r\nwhose behalf the justice and generosity of his majesty is now reclaimed.\r\n\r\nI am now, Sir, to ask the favor of you to communicate this application to\r\nyour court, to inform them that Commodore Paul Jones, who will present\r\nhimself to them, is authorized to solicit and arrange this matter, and\r\nto ask your good offices with his majesty and his ministers, so that the\r\nrepresentations of Mr. Jones may find their way to them, which we are\r\nassured is all that is necessary to obtain justice.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. MCCARLEY.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, August 19, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--On the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, I called on\r\none of the Farmers General, who is of my acquaintance, and asked of\r\nhim explanations of the reasons for the low prices offered for tobacco.\r\nHe said they considered themselves as bound to purchase the quantities\r\nas directed by the order of Berny, and at the prices therein ordered,\r\nwhich quantities they apportioned among the ports according their wants,\r\nallotting certain quantities to be bought weekly or monthly. That when\r\ngreater quantities offered, they thought themselves at liberty to buy them\r\nat a lower price, if the holder would take it--that this was done by a\r\nprevious contract. I gave him an extract of the letter, and he promised to\r\ninquire into it, and to use his influence that justice should be done you.\r\n\r\nIf you made an express contract for the prices you mention, without doubt\r\nyou will be held to them. If you did not make a contract, I think it is as\r\ncertain you will be entitled to the prices fixed by the government. Should\r\nthey refuse justice, I am told you may have redress by application to a\r\ncourt on the spot, or to a tribunal at Paris, which takes cognizance of\r\nwhatever relates to the farmers. But I believe, also, that the committee\r\nwho proposed this regulation, are authorized to take cognizance of all\r\ninfractions of it. As soon as I obtain an answer from the Farmers General,\r\nI will do myself the pleasure of communicating it to you. I am, with much\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, August 22, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favors of June 16th, July 15th, 18th and 31st, I have the honor\r\nnow to acknowledge. I have been for a month past so closely employed, that\r\nit has been out of my power to do myself the pleasure sooner of writing\r\nto you on the several subjects they contain. I formerly wrote you the\r\nreason why Mr. Grand has not paid your bills; that is to say, the want\r\nof a letter of advice. As to the notary's calling on me as inserted in\r\nthe protest, I do not remember that he did. Persons calling on me with\r\ndemands on account of the United States, I generally refer to Mr. Grand,\r\nwith information that I have nothing to do with the moneys of the United\r\nStates. Mr. Grand, by refusing to make payments without my order in many\r\ncases, has obliged me to interfere till I could obtain instructions to\r\nhim from the treasury as to the manner in which he should govern himself.\r\nWith respect to your bill, I am thoroughly satisfied he had no reason for\r\nnot paying it but the want of a letter of advice. Had there been one, I\r\nwould have ordered the payment; but this being a caution required between\r\nprivate individuals, it was less to be dispensed with in the case of the\r\npublic. I believe I may venture to assure you, that if you will always\r\nwrite a letter of advice with your bills, they will always be honored.\r\nIf the mode of doing business at Madrid would admit their being drawn at\r\nso many days' sight, it would be better, because it would allow time to\r\nconsult you, if the letter of advice is miscarried.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first notice of them has been the demand of payment. However, this\r\nis not essential, nor anything else except the letter of advice--not even\r\nthe having money in our funds here, for this sometimes happens. I had your\r\nlast bills, those of Mr. Dumas, and some other federal demands, paid out\r\nof a sum of money lodged here by the State of Virginia for the purchase\r\nof arms. However, we have at present three months' supplies on hand. I am\r\nto thank you for the map which I received of Mr. Randall. Mr. Barclay has\r\nsent from Cadiz some of the books purchased there. Should you at any time\r\nmeet with any of the others named in my catalogue, at reasonable prices,\r\nI will thank you to think of me. I paid Mr. Barclay's draught for those\r\ncoming from Cadiz, and will answer yours, or find means of remitting the\r\nmoney to you for the map and such other books as you may be so good as to\r\npurchase for me. I return you, according to your desire, O'Bryan's letter,\r\nhaving sent copies of that and other papers you have forwarded me from\r\ntime to time, as also an extract from your own letters on the Barclay\r\naffairs to Congress, and to Mr. Adams. Mr. Adams left London about the\r\n3d or 4th instant, for the Hague, to exchange ratifications of our treaty\r\nwith Prussia with the Baron de Thulemeyer, and also to take leave of their\r\nhigh-mightinesses, which he had not done before. I suppose that by this\r\ntime he is returned to London. It is inconceivable to me what difficulties\r\ncan have arisen on our treaty with Portugal. However, the delay of the\r\nsignature indicates that there are such. You intimate the expediency\r\nof the mutual appointment of consuls between Denmark and us. But our\r\nparticular constitution occasions a difficulty. You know that a consul\r\nis the creature of a convention altogether,--that without this he must be\r\nunknown, and his jurisdiction unacknowledged by the laws of the country in\r\nwhich he is placed. The will of the Sovereign in most countries can give\r\na jurisdiction by a simple order. With us, the confederation admitting\r\nCongress to make treaties with foreign powers, they can by treaty or\r\nconvention provide for the admission and jurisdiction of consuls and the\r\nconfederation, and whatever is done under it, being paramount to the laws\r\nof the States, this establishes the power of the consuls. But without a\r\nconvention, the laws of the States cannot take any notice of a consul,\r\nnor permit him to exercise any jurisdiction. In the case of Temple, the\r\nconsul from England, therefore, Congress could only say he should have\r\nsuch power as the law of nations, and the laws of the States admitted. But\r\nnone of the States having passed laws but for nations in alliance with\r\nus, Temple can exercise no jurisdiction nor authority. You ask in what\r\nstate is our treaty with Naples? Congress gave powers to Mr. A., Dr. F.\r\nand myself, to form treaties of alliance and commerce with every nation in\r\nEurope with whom it could be supposed we should have an intercourse of any\r\nsort. These powers were to continue two years. We offered to treat with\r\nall nations. Prussia made a treaty with us. Portugal we expect does the\r\nsame. Tuscany exchanged propositions backwards and forwards with us, but\r\nbefore they could be completed, our powers expired. The Emperor somewhat\r\nthe same. But all other nations made professions of friendship, and said\r\nthey supposed a commerce could be carried on without a treaty. Spain, you\r\nknow, treats at New York. At present, therefore, we stand thus: France,\r\nthe United Netherlands, Sweden and Prussia, are connected by treaty. Spain\r\nand Portugal will probably be so. Perhaps the powers may be renewed for\r\nthe Emperor and Tuscany. But as to every other nation of Europe, I am\r\npersuaded Congress will never offer a treaty. If any of them should desire\r\none hereafter, I suppose they will make the first overtures. In fact, the\r\nexclusion of our vessels from the English and Spanish American possessions\r\nin America, and the modified reception of them in the French islands, may\r\nrender regulations on our part necessary, which might be embarrassed by\r\na multiplication of treaties with other nations. I think, therefore, that\r\nat present Congress would not wish to make any other treaties than those\r\nactually in agitation with Spain and Portugal. A Commercial Congress is to\r\nmeet to prepare an article defining the extent of the powers over commerce\r\nwhich it may be expedient to give to the United States in Congress\r\nassembled. Every State has appointed deputies to meet for this purpose,\r\nexcept Maryland, which declined it because they thought the established\r\nCongress might propose an article. It is thought they will still appoint,\r\nbut that at any rate they will accede to what shall be done. Congress\r\nbeing once invested with these powers will be the less embarrassed in\r\nthe system in proportion as their hands are less tied up by engagements\r\nwith other powers. While Mr. A., Dr. F. and myself were here together, it\r\nwas made a question whether we should send agents to the Barbary powers,\r\nor receive their agents here. As these would expect to be supported, we\r\nthought the former the more economical plan. An agent from Algiers to\r\nMadrid must have great presents, and be pompously supported. This induced\r\nus to send Mr. Lambe to Algiers. The possibility that mal-adroitness\r\nin him may leave something yet practicable by Mr. Barclay, may perhaps\r\noccasion a mission of this latter gentleman to Algiers. On this, I expect\r\nto hear from Mr. Adams as soon as he returns from the Hague. As to myself,\r\nI confess I expect nothing from Algiers, were we to send an angel, without\r\nmore money than we are authorized to give them. We desired Mr. Lambe to\r\nrepair to Congress, that he might, by his information, aid them in their\r\ndecisions. He answers us by resigning his commission, saying that his\r\nhealth will not permit him either to go to Congress or to come to us;\r\nyet he desires we will settle his accounts. It would seem, then, as if\r\nhe meant to live at Alicant, Carthagena, or somewhere there. Certainly we\r\ncannot go to him. If he has still money in your banker's hands belonging\r\nto the United States, and you judge from any circumstances that it ought\r\nto be stopped, be so good as to write us on the subject, and in the\r\nmeantime to stop it. You observe, that I do not write to you on foreign\r\nsubjects. My reason has been, that our letters are often opened; and I do\r\nnot know that you have yet received the cypher Mr. Barclay was to leave\r\nwith you. If you have not, be so good as to ask a copy of his, which being\r\nalready in the hands of Mr. Jay, Mr. Adams, and myself, will enable you to\r\nwrite in cypher to any of us. Indeed, I wish you could get the one from\r\nMr. Lambe, which is a copy. I have seen the Chevalier de Burgoyne two or\r\nthree times, and was much pleased with him. He expressed great friendship\r\nfor you. I have not yet seen Mr. Calver, but shall surely pay all the\r\nattention I can to him, as well as to any other person you may be so kind\r\nas to recommend. My letters and papers from America come down to the last\r\nweek in June. They inform me that treaties are concluded with most of the\r\nIndian nations within our boundaries, that lands are purchased of them,\r\nand Hutchins, the surveyor for the United States, gone out to lay them\r\noff. Straggling Indians, however, still molest our settlements. But it is\r\nneither in the general disposition, nor in the power of those tribes to do\r\nus any serious ill. All the States have agreed to the impost. But New York\r\nhas annexed such conditions as that it cannot be accepted. It is thought,\r\ntherefore, they will grant it unconditionally. But a new difficulty has\r\nstarted up. Three or four States had coupled the grant of the impost with\r\nthe grant of the supplementary funds, asked by Congress at the same time,\r\ndeclaring that they should come into force only when all the States had\r\ngranted both. One of these, Pennsylvania, refuses to let the impost come\r\ninto being alone. We are still to see whether they will persist in this.\r\nI enclose you a copy of an act of the Virginia Assembly for religious\r\nfreedom, which I had translated here into French and Italian. It is one\r\nchapter only of the revised code of the laws of that State, which their\r\nAssembly began to pass at their last session, and will finish at their\r\nnext. Pennsylvania is proposing a reformation of their criminal laws;\r\nNew York of their whole code. I send you also the article \"Etats Unis\" of\r\nthe Encyclopedie Methodique, which came out two or three days ago only.\r\nThey have printed some copies of this article by itself. The two first\r\nsections you will find bad: in the others are several errors; but there\r\nare a great number of details made on authentic materials, and to be\r\nrelied on. Remarkable deaths in America are General Cadwallader, Colonel\r\nTilghman (Tench), General McDougal, and Mrs. Wilson, wife of the member of\r\nCongress. Mr. Telfair is Governor of Georgia, Collins of Rhode Island, and\r\nS. Huntington of Massachusetts. I observe that S. Adams is not re-elected\r\npresident of the Senate of Massachusetts. I know not the reason of this.\r\nRecollecting nothing else material, and having sufficiently fatigued you\r\nalready, I shall conclude with assurances of the esteem and respect with\r\nwhich I have the honor to be, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, August 24, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your other friends here being so much better qualified to\r\ngive you the transactions of the metropolis during your absence, it\r\nwould be presumption in me to touch on them. I assume, therefore, the\r\noffice of your correspondent for American affairs, in the discharge\r\nof which, I may stand a chance to communicate to you details which you\r\ncannot get in the ordinary course of your correspondence, and which the\r\ninterest you are so good as to take in our affairs will sometimes render\r\nagreeable to you. My letters and papers from America came down to the\r\n16th of July. The impost then wanted the accession of New York only,\r\nbut another difficulty had started up. Three or four of the States had\r\ncoupled together the impost and the supplementary funds, so that neither\r\ncould take place till all the States had granted both. Pennsylvania was\r\nof this number, and though desired by Congress to suffer the impost to be\r\nestablished unconnected with the supplementary funds, they have refused,\r\nsaying, that should the interest of the foreign debt get into a course\r\nof regular payment, separately from that of the domestic one, the other\r\nStates will be the less ready to provide for the latter. Some of the\r\nother States have hereupon provided the supplementary funds. It remains\r\nto see whether it will be easiest to get all the States to do this, or\r\nto prevail on Pennsylvania to recede. All the States have come into the\r\nVirginia proposition for a commercial convention, the deputies of which\r\nare to agree on the form of an article giving to Congress the regulation\r\nof their commerce. Maryland alone has not named deputies, conceiving\r\nthat Congress might as well propose the article. They are, however, for\r\ngiving the power, and will, therefore, either nominate deputies to the\r\nconvention, or accede to their measures. Massachusetts and New Hampshire\r\nhave suspended their navigation acts. The English encroachments on the\r\nprovince of Maine become serious. They have seized vessels, too, on our\r\ncoast of Passimaquaddy, thereby displaying a pretension to the exclusive\r\njurisdiction to the Bay of Fundi, which separates Nova Scotia and Le\r\nMaine, and belongs as much to us as them. The Spaniards have not yet\r\nrelinquished the fort of the Natches, and our arrangements with them hang\r\non a great obstacle, indispensable with us, and of which they are unjustly\r\nand unwisely tenacious. The Indians, both Northern and Southern, have made\r\npeace, except the Creeks, who have made a formidable attack on Georgia.\r\nScattering parties of the Northern Indians, too, have killed some persons\r\nin Kentucky. They are unacknowledged, however, by their nations. I observe\r\nthat Samuel Adams is not re-elected President of the Senate. I cannot\r\nconjecture the reason of this. General Sullivan is made President of New\r\nHampshire, Generals Green, McDougal, and Williamson are dead. There have\r\nbeen, for some time, twelve States present in Congress. By a letter from\r\nMr. Barclay, of July 16, I expect our peace with Morocco is signed. For\r\nthis we are indebted to the honest offices of Spain. Your letter to some\r\nfriend in Boston, enclosing M. de Calonne's of November 19, 1785, on the\r\nsubject of whale oils, is printed at length in our papers. Your name is\r\nto it, but not that of the person to whom addressed, nor any date. It will\r\ndo you just service there: the only question is whether it may not disarm\r\nyou here. I have as yet not heard a tittle from M. de Calonnes on the\r\nsubject of our commerce. I have received from you, from London, Andrew's\r\nhistory of the war, and Cooper's travels. McIntosh's is not to be bought,\r\nthe whole edition being exhausted. Our Madeira will be in Paris to-day\r\nor to-morrow. I shall be able to have a small copying press completed for\r\nyou here in about three weeks. Must it wait your return, or will you have\r\nit sent to you? Adhering to my promise of saying nothing to you of what I\r\nknow so imperfectly as the affairs of this country, I shall conclude with\r\nassurances of the sincere esteem with which I have the honor to be, dear\r\nSir, your most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. VAN HOGENDORP.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, August 25, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of the 2d instant has been duly received, and I employ\r\nthe first moment which has been at my disposal to answer it. The author\r\nof the part of the new Encyclopedie which relates to political economy,\r\nhaving asked of me materials for the article \"Etat Unis,\" stating a number\r\nof questions relative to them, I answered them as minutely and exactly\r\nas was in my power. He has from these compiled the greater part of that\r\narticle. I take the liberty of enclosing you one of them, which will give\r\nyou all the details to which your letter refers. I can even refer you to\r\nthe pages which answer your several questions.\r\n\r\nWhat is the extent of the Congress power in managing the affairs of the\r\nUnited States?\r\n\r\nThe 6th and 9th articles of the confederation will explain these. Those\r\nwhich it is thought they still need, you will find indicated in this\r\npamphlet, pages 29, 30, and in 31-6, their powers of coercion.\r\n\r\n_Ques._--What are the expenses of Congress?\r\n\r\n_Ans._--Page 31-6, and 43-6.\r\n\r\n_Ques._--Which the revenue?\r\n\r\n_Ans._--As yet they have no standing revenue; they have asked standing\r\nrevenues as they shall be noted under a subsequent question. In the\r\nmeantime they call annually for the sums necessary for the federal\r\ngovernment. See pages 43, 44.\r\n\r\n_Ques._--In which way does the particular State contribute to the general\r\nexpenses?\r\n\r\n_Ans._--Congress, once a year, calculate the sum necessary the succeeding\r\nyear to pay the interest of their debt and to defray the expenses of the\r\nfederal government. This sum they then apportion on the several States\r\naccording to the table page 44. And the States then raise each its part by\r\nsuch taxes as they think proper.\r\n\r\n_Ques._--Are general duties, to be levied by Congress, still expected to\r\nbe acquiesced to by the States?\r\n\r\n_Ans._--See page 30, a. New York, the only State which had not granted the\r\nimpost of 5 per cent., has done it at a late session, but has reserved\r\nto herself the appointment of collectors. Congress will not receive\r\nit upon that condition. It is believed that New York will recede from\r\nthis condition. Still, a difficulty will remain; the impost of 5 per\r\ncent. not being deemed sufficient to pay the interest of our whole debt,\r\nforeign and domestic. Congress asked at the same time (that is in 1783)\r\nsupplementary funds to make good the deficiency. Several of the States\r\nhave not yet provided those supplementary funds. Some of those which have\r\nprovided them, have declared that the impost and the supplementary fund\r\nshall commence only when all the States have granted both. Congress have\r\ndesired those States to uncouple the grants, so that each may come into\r\nforce separately as soon as it is given by all the States. Pennsylvania\r\nhas declared this way, that if the impost be granted alone, as that will\r\ndo little more than pay the interest of the foreign debt, the other States\r\nwill be less urgent to provide for the interest of the domestic debt.\r\nShe wishes, therefore, to avail herself of the general desire to provide\r\nfor the foreign creditors in order to enforce a just attention to the\r\ndomestic ones. The question is whether it will be more easy to prevail on\r\nPennsylvania to recede from this condition, or the other States to comply\r\nwith it. The treaties with the Indians have experienced greater delay than\r\nwas expected. They are, however, completed, and the surveyors are gone\r\ninto that country to lay out the land in lots. As soon as some progress\r\nis made in this, the sale of lands will commence, and I have a firm faith\r\nthat they will, in a short time absorb the whole of the certificates of\r\nthe domestic debt.\r\n\r\nThe Philadelphia Bank was incorporated by Congress. This is, perhaps,\r\nthe only instance of their having done that which they had no power to\r\ndo. Necessity obliged them to give this institution the appearance of\r\ntheir countenance, because in that moment they were without any other\r\nresource for money. The Legislature of Pennsylvania, however, passed an\r\nact of incorporation for the bank, and declared that the holders of stock\r\nshould be responsible only to the amount of their stock. Lately that\r\nLegislature has repealed their act. The consequence is, that the bank is\r\nnow altogether a private institution, and every holder is liable for its\r\nengagements in his whole property. This has had a curious effect. It has\r\ngiven those who deposit money in the bank a greater faith in it, while\r\nit has rendered the holders very discontented, as being more exposed to\r\nrisk, and has induced many to sell out, so that I have heard (I know not\r\nhow truly) that bank stock sells somewhat below par; it has been said\r\n7 1-2 per cent.; but as the publication was from the enemies of the bank,\r\nI do not give implicit faith to it. With respect to the article, \"Etats\r\nUnis\" of the Encyclopedie now enclosed, I am far from making myself\r\nresponsible for the whole of the article. The two first sections are\r\ntaken chiefly from the Abbé Raynal, and they are therefore wrong exactly\r\nin the same proportion the other sections are generally right. Even in\r\nthem, however, there is here and there an error. But, on the whole, it\r\nis good, and the only thing as yet printed which gives a just idea of the\r\nAmerican constitutions. There will be another good work, a very good one,\r\npublished here soon, by a Mr. Mazzei, who has been many years a resident\r\nof Virginia, is well informed and possessed of a masculine understanding.\r\nI should rather have said it will be published in Holland, for I believe\r\nit cannot be printed here. I should be happy indeed in an opportunity of\r\nvisiting Holland, but I know not when it will occur. In the meantime, it\r\nwould give me great pleasure to see you here. I think you would find both\r\npleasure and use in such a trip. I feel a sincere interest in the fall\r\nof your country, and am disposed to wish well to either party only as I\r\ncan see in their measures a tendency to bring on an amelioration of the\r\ncondition of the people; an increase in the mass of happiness. But this\r\nis a subject for conversation. My paper warns me that it is time to assure\r\nyou of the esteem and respect with which I have the honor to be, dear Sir,\r\nyour most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BARCLAY.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, September 22, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I was honored a few days ago with the receipt of your letter of\r\nAugust 11th. In my last to you, I informed you that I had proposed to\r\nMr. Adams to avail ourselves of your service at Algiers. I acknowledge\r\nthat I had no expectation, with our small means, you could effect a\r\ntreaty there; but I thought their ultimatum might be discovered, and\r\nother intelligence obtained which might repay us the trouble and expense\r\nof the journey. I wished, also, to know what might be the effect of the\r\ninterposition of the court of Madrid, now that it is likely to interpose.\r\nA letter recently received from Mr. Carmichael informs me, that it is the\r\nopinion of the Counts de Florida Blanca and D'Expilly, that nothing can\r\nbe effected at Algiers till there be a previous treaty with the Ottoman\r\nPorte. Independently of that information, Mr. Adams is of opinion, that no\r\ngood can result at present from a further attempt at Algiers. The Porte,\r\nAlgiers, Tunis and Tripoli must remain for the further deliberation of\r\nCongress. Of course, we have no occasion to trouble you with any further\r\nvisits to those powers, and leave you at liberty to return here, to\r\nLondon, or to America, as you shall think proper. We are happy that your\r\nsuccessful efforts with the Emperor of Morocco have left the Atlantic open\r\nto our commerce, and little dangerous.\r\n\r\nI have the pleasure to inform you that Mrs. Barclay and family are well,\r\nand am, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and respect, your very\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, September 26, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My last letter to you was dated the 27th of August, since\r\nwhich I have received yours of September 11th. The letter to Mr. Lambe\r\ntherein enclosed, I immediately signed and forwarded. In mine, wherein I\r\nhad the honor of proposing to you the mission of Mr. Barclay to Algiers,\r\nI mentioned that my expectations from it were of a subordinate nature\r\nonly. I very readily, therefore, recede from it in compliance with your\r\njudgment--that his mission might do more harm than good. I accordingly\r\nwrote to Mr. Barclay, that he was at liberty to return to this place, to\r\nLondon, or to America, as he should think best. I now enclose you copies\r\nof such letters from him, Mr. Lambe and Mr. Carmichael, as have come to\r\nhand since my last to you. I have had opportunities of making further\r\ninquiry as to the premium of insurance at L'Orient for vessels bound to\r\nor from America, and I find that no additional premium is there required\r\non account of the risk of capture by the Barbary States. This fact may be\r\nworth mentioning to American merchants in London.\r\n\r\nWe have been continually endeavoring to obtain a deduction of the duties\r\non American whale oil. The prospect was not flattering. I shall avail\r\nmyself of the information contained in your letter to press this matter\r\nfurther. Mr. Barrett has arrived here, and the first object for his\r\nrelief, is to obtain a dissolution of his former contract. I will thank\r\nyou for some copies of the Prussian treaty by the first opportunity, and\r\ntake the liberty of troubling you to forward the packet of letters which\r\nMr. Smith, the bearer of this, will have the honor of delivering to you.\r\nI beg the favor of you to present my most respectful compliments to Mrs.\r\nAdams, and to be assured yourself of the sentiments of sincere esteem and\r\nrespect with which I have the honor to be, dear Sir, your most obedient,\r\nand humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, September 26, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The last letters I had the honor of writing you were of the 11th\r\nand 13th of August. Since that, I have been favored with yours of July\r\n14th and August the 13th. I now enclose you such letters on the Barclay\r\nnegotiations as have come to hand since my last. With these, is the\r\ncopy of a joint letter from Mr. Adams and myself to Mr. Lambe. In mine\r\nof August 13th, I mentioned that I had proposed it as a subject of\r\nconsideration to Mr. Adams, whether the mission of Mr. Barclay to Algiers\r\nmight answer any good purpose. He is of opinion that it could not. I have,\r\ntherefore, informed Mr. Barclay, who by this time, is probably in Spain,\r\nthat he is at liberty to return to this place, to London or America, as he\r\nshall think proper. You will perceive by the letter from Mr. Carmichael,\r\nthat it is the opinion of the Counts de Florida Blanca and D'Expilly, that\r\na treaty with the Ottoman Porte is necessary before one can be made with\r\nAlgiers. Such a treaty will require presents, not indeed as the price of\r\nthe peace, but such as are usually made in compliment to their ministers.\r\nBut as it would be ineffectual towards opening to us the Mediterranean\r\nuntil a peace with Algiers can be obtained, there seems to be no reason\r\nfor pressing it till there is a prospect of settlement with the Algerines.\r\n\r\nSince the death of the King of Prussia, the symptoms of war between the\r\nPorte and the Russians and Venetians have become stronger. I think it is\r\nthe opinion of this court, however, that there will be no war shortly on\r\nthe Continent. I judge this as well from other information as from the\r\ncircumstance of a late reduction of their land force. All their military\r\npreparations seems to be against a naval war. Nevertheless, their treaty\r\nwith England has lately taken a sudden start. Declarations have been\r\nexchanged between the negotiators in the nature of preliminaries to a\r\ndefinitive treaty. The particulars of these declarations are not yet\r\ncertainly known.\r\n\r\nI was lately asked by the Imperial ambassador whether I had received an\r\nanswer on the subject of the proposition to our powers to treat with his\r\nsovereign. A discrimination which they understand to have been made in\r\nAmerica between the subjects of powers having treaties with us and those\r\nhaving none, seems to be the motive of their pressing this matter.\r\n\r\nIt being known that M. de Calonne, the Minister of Finance, is at his\r\nwits' end to raise supplies for the ensuing year, a proposition has been\r\nmade him by a Dutch company to purchase the debt of the United States\r\nto this country for seventy millions of livres in hand. His necessities\r\ndispose him to accede to the proposition; but a hesitation is produced by\r\nthe apprehension, that it might lessen our credit in Europe, and perhaps\r\nbe disagreeable to Congress. I have been consulted here only by the agent\r\nfor that company. I informed him that I could not judge what effect it\r\nmight have on our credit, and was not authorized either to approve or\r\ndisapprove of the transaction. I have since reflected on this subject.\r\nIf there be a danger that our payments may not be punctual, it might be\r\nbetter that the discontents which would thence arise should be transferred\r\nfrom a court, of whose good will we have so much need, to the breasts\r\nof a private company. But it has occurred to me, that we might find\r\noccasion to do what would be grateful to this court, and establish with\r\nthem a confidence in our honor. I am informed that our credit in Holland\r\nis sound. Might it not be possible, then, to borrow the four-and-twenty\r\nmillions due to this country, and thus pay them their whole debt at\r\nonce? This would save them from any loss on our account. Is it liable to\r\nthe objection of impropriety in creating new debts before we have more\r\ncertain means of paying them? It is only transferring from one creditor\r\nto another, and removing the causes of discontent to persons with whom\r\nthey would do us less injury. Thinking that this matter is worthy of\r\nthe attention of Congress, I will endeavor that the negotiation shall be\r\nretarded till it may be possible for me to know their decision, which,\r\ntherefore, I will take the liberty of praying immediately.\r\n\r\nYou will have heard, before this comes to hand, that the parties in the\r\nUnited Netherlands have come to an open rupture. How far it will proceed,\r\ncannot now be foreseen. I send you herewith the gazettes of France and\r\nLeyden to this date, and have the honor of being, with sentiments of the\r\nmost perfect esteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PREVOT DES MARCHANDS ET ECHEVINS DE PARIS.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, September 27, 1786.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--The commonwealth of Virginia, in gratitude for the services\r\nof Major General the Marquis de La Fayette, have determined to erect his\r\nbust in their capital. Desirous to place a like monument of his worth,\r\nand of their sense of it, in the country to which they are indebted for\r\nhis birth, they have hoped that the city of Paris will consent to become\r\nthe depository of this second testimony of their gratitude. Being charged\r\nby them with the execution of their wishes, I have the honor to solicit\r\nof Messieurs le Prevot des Marchands et Echevins, on behalf of the city,\r\ntheir acceptance of a bust of this gallant officer, and that they will be\r\npleased to place it where, doing most honor to him, it will most gratify\r\nthe feelings of an allied nation.\r\n\r\nIt is with true pleasure that I obey the call of that commonwealth, to\r\nrender just homage to a character so great in its first developments, that\r\nthey would honor the close of any other. Their country, covered by a small\r\narmy against a great one, their exhausted means supplied by his talents,\r\ntheir enemies finally forced to that spot whither their allies and\r\nconfederates were collecting to receive them, and a war which had spread\r\nits miseries into the four quarters of the earth, thus reduced to a single\r\npoint, where one blow should terminate it, and through the whole, an\r\nimplicit respect paid to the laws of the land; these are facts which would\r\nillustrate any character, and which fully justify the warmth of those\r\nfeelings, of which I have the honor on this occasion to be the organ.\r\n\r\nIt would have been more pleasing to me to have executed this office in\r\nperson, to have mingled the tribute of private gratitude with that of my\r\ncountry, and, at the same time, to have had an opportunity of presenting\r\nto your honorable body, the homage of that profound respect which I have\r\nthe honor to bear them. But I am withheld from these grateful duties\r\nby the consequences of a fall, which confine me to my room. Mr. Short,\r\ntherefore, a citizen of the State of Virginia, and heretofore a member of\r\nits Council of State, will have the honor of delivering you this letter,\r\ntogether with the resolution of the General Assembly of Virginia. He will\r\nhave that, also, of presenting the bust at such time and place, as you\r\nwill be so good as to signify your pleasure to receive it. Through him,\r\nI beg to be allowed the honor of presenting those sentiments of profound\r\nrespect and veneration, with which I am, Gentlemen, your most obedient,\r\nand most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BARON DE STAEL.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have the honor of communicating to your Excellency the copy of\r\na treaty of amity and commerce concluded between the United States of\r\nAmerica and his late Majesty the King of Prussia, in the two languages in\r\nwhich it was written, each of which was agreed to be equally original.\r\nThe exchange of ratifications we made but little before the death of\r\nthe King. This circumstance, with the delays which have attended the\r\nprinting and transmitting the copies of the treaty to me, have prevented\r\nmy making an earlier communication of it to your Excellency, as a mark of\r\nthe confidence and the respect we bear to the nation whom you so worthily\r\nrepresent here, and with which we have the honor of being allied.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect respect and\r\nesteem, your Excellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. COSWAY.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, October 26, 1786.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MADAM,--Having performed the last sad office of handing you\r\ninto your carriage, at the pavillon de St. Denis, and seen the wheels\r\nget actually into motion, I turned on my heel and walked, more dead\r\nthan alive, to the opposite door, where my own was awaiting me. Mr.\r\nDanquerville was missing. He was sought for, found, and dragged down\r\nstairs. We were crammed into the carriage, like recruits for the Bastille,\r\nand not having soul enough to give orders to the coachman, he presumed\r\nParis our destination, and drove off. After a considerable interval,\r\nsilence was broke, with a \"_Je suis vraiment afflige du depart de ces\r\nbons gens_.\" This was a signal for a mutual confession of distress. We\r\nbegan immediately to talk of Mr. and Mrs. Cosway, of their goodness, their\r\ntalents, their amiability; and, though we spoke of nothing else, we seemed\r\nhardly to have entered into the matter, when the coachman announced the\r\nrue St. Denis, and that we were opposite Mr. Danquerville's. He insisted\r\non descending there, and traversing a short passage to his lodgings. I\r\nwas carried home. Seated by my fireside, solitary and sad, the following\r\ndialogue took place between my Head and my Heart.\r\n\r\n_Head._ Well, friend, you seem to be in a pretty trim.\r\n\r\n_Heart._ I am indeed the most wretched of all earthly beings. Overwhelmed\r\nwith grief, every fibre of my frame distended beyond its natural powers to\r\nbear, I would willingly meet whatever catastrophe should leave me no more\r\nto feel, or to fear.\r\n\r\n_Head._ These are the eternal consequences of your warmth and\r\nprecipitation. This is one of the scrapes into which you are ever leading\r\nus. You confess your follies, indeed; but still you hug and cherish them;\r\nand no reformation can be hoped where there is no repentance.\r\n\r\n_Heart._ Oh, my friend! this is no moment to upbraid my foibles. I am\r\nrent into fragments by the force of my grief! If you have any balm, pour\r\nit into my wounds; if none, do not harrow them by new torments. Spare me\r\nin this awful moment! At any other, I will attend with patience to your\r\nadmonitions.\r\n\r\n_Head._ On the contrary, I never found that the moment of triumph, with\r\nyou, was the moment of attention to my admonitions. While suffering under\r\nyour follies, you may perhaps be made sensible of them, but the paroxysm\r\nover, you fancy it can never return. Harsh, therefore, as the medicine may\r\nbe, it is my office to administer it. You will be pleased to remember,\r\nthat when our friend Trumbull used to be telling us of the merits and\r\ntalents of these good people, I never ceased whispering to you that we\r\nhad no occasion for new acquaintances; that the greater their merits and\r\ntalents, the more dangerous their friendship to our tranquillity, because\r\nthe regret at parting would be greater.\r\n\r\n_Heart._ Accordingly, Sir, this acquaintance was not the consequence of\r\nmy doings. It was one of your projects, which threw us in the way of it.\r\nIt was you, remember, and not I, who desired the meeting at Legrand and\r\nMotinos. I never trouble myself with domes nor arches. The Halle aux bleds\r\nmight have rotted down, before I should have gone to see it. But you,\r\nforsooth, who are eternally getting us to sleep with your diagrams and\r\ncrotchets, must go and examine this wonderful piece of architecture; and\r\nwhen you had seen it, oh! it was the most superb thing on earth! What you\r\nhad seen there was worth all you had yet seen in Paris! I thought so too.\r\nBut I meant it of the lady and gentleman to whom we had been presented;\r\nand not of a parcel of sticks and chips put together in pens. You, then,\r\nSir, and not I, have been the cause of the present distress.\r\n\r\n_Head._ It would have been happy for you if my diagrams and crotchets\r\nhad gotten you to sleep on that day, as you are pleased to say they\r\neternally do. My visit to Legrand and Motinos had public utility for its\r\nobject. A market is to be built in Richmond. What a commodious plan is\r\nthat of Legrand and Motinos; especially, if we put on it the noble dome\r\nof the Halle aux bleds. If such a bridge as they showed us can be thrown\r\nacross the Schuylkill, at Philadelphia, the floating bridges taken up,\r\nand the navigation of that river opened, what a copious resource will be\r\nadded, of wood and provisions, to warm and feed the poor of that city?\r\nWhile I was occupied with these objects, you were dilating with your\r\nnew acquaintances, and contriving how to prevent a separation from them.\r\nEvery soul of you had an engagement for the day. Yet all these were to\r\nbe sacrificed, that you might dine together. Lying messengers were to be\r\ndespatched into every quarter of the city, with apologies for your breach\r\nof engagement. You, particularly, had the effrontery to send word to the\r\nDutchess Danville, that on the moment we were setting out to dine with her,\r\ndespatches came to hand, which required immediate attention. You wanted\r\nme to invent a more ingenious excuse; but I knew you were getting into a\r\nscrape, and I would have nothing to do with it. Well; after dinner to St.\r\nCloud, from St. Cloud to Ruggieri's, from Ruggieri's to Krumfoltz; and\r\nif the day had been as long as a Lapland summer day, you would still have\r\ncontrived means among you to have filled it.\r\n\r\n_Heart._ Oh! my dear friend, how you have revived me by recalling to my\r\nmind the transactions of that day! How well I remember them all, and that,\r\nwhen I came home at night, and looked back to the morning, it seemed to\r\nhave been a month agone. Go on, then, like a kind comforter, and paint to\r\nme the day we went to St. Germains. How beautiful was every object! the\r\nPort de Reuilly, the hills along the Seine, the rainbows of the machine of\r\nMarly, the terrace of St. Germains, the chateaux, the gardens, the statues\r\nof Marly, the pavillon of Lucienne. Recollect, too, Madrid, Bagatelle,\r\nthe King's garden, the Dessert. How grand the idea excited by the remains\r\nof such a column. The spiral staircase, too, was beautiful. Every moment\r\nwas filled with something agreeable. The wheels of time moved on with a\r\nrapidity, of which those of our carriage gave but a faint idea. And yet,\r\nin the evening, when one took a retrospect of the day, what a mass of\r\nhappiness had we travelled over! Retrace all those scenes to me, my good\r\ncompanion, and I will forgive the unkindness with which you were chiding\r\nme. The day we went to St. Germains was a little too warm, I think; was it\r\nnot?\r\n\r\n_Head._ Thou art the most incorrigible of all the beings that ever sinned!\r\nI reminded you of the follies of the first day, intending to deduce from\r\nthence some useful lessons for you; but instead of listening to them, you\r\nkindle at the recollection, you retrace the whole series with a fondness,\r\nwhich shows you want nothing, but the opportunity, to act it over again.\r\nI often told you, during its course, that you were imprudently engaging\r\nyour affections, under circumstances that must have cost you a great deal\r\nof pain; that the persons, indeed, were of the greatest merit, possessing\r\ngood sense, good humor, honest hearts, honest manners, and eminence in\r\na lovely art; that the lady had, moreover, qualities and accomplishments\r\nbelonging to her sex, which might form a chapter apart for her; such as\r\nmusic, modesty, beauty, and that softness of disposition, which is the\r\nornament of her sex and charm of ours; but that all these considerations\r\nwould increase the pang of separation; that their stay here was to be\r\nshort; that you rack our whole system when you are parted from those you\r\nlove, complaining that such a separation is worse than death, inasmuch\r\nas this ends our sufferings, whereas that only begins them; and that\r\nthe separation would, in this instance, be the more severe, as you would\r\nprobably never see them again.\r\n\r\n_Heart._ But they told me they would come back again, the next year.\r\n\r\n_Head._ But, in the meantime, see what you suffer; and their return, too,\r\ndepends on so many circumstances, that if you had a grain of prudence, you\r\nwould not count upon it. Upon the whole, it is improbable, and therefore\r\nyou should abandon the idea of ever seeing them again.\r\n\r\n_Heart._ May heaven abandon me if I do!\r\n\r\n_Head._ Very well. Suppose, then, they come back. They are to stay two\r\nmonths, and, when these are expired, what is to follow? Perhaps you\r\nflatter yourself they may come to America?\r\n\r\n_Heart._ God only knows what is to happen. I see nothing impossible in\r\nthat supposition; and I see things wonderfully contrived sometimes, to\r\nmake us happy. Where could they find such objects as in America, for\r\nthe exercise of their enchanting art? especially the lady, who paints\r\nlandscapes so inimitably. She wants only subjects worthy of immortality,\r\nto render her pencil immortal. The Falling Spring, the Cascade of Niagara,\r\nthe passage of the Potomac through the Blue Mountains, the Natural Bridge;\r\nit is worth a voyage across the Atlantic to see these objects; much more\r\nto paint, and make them, and thereby ourselves, known to all ages. And\r\nour own dear Monticello; where has nature spread so rich a mantle under\r\nthe eye? mountains, forests, rocks, rivers. With what majesty do we there\r\nride above the storms! How sublime to look down into the workhouse of\r\nnature, to see her clouds, hail, snow, rain, thunder, all fabricated at\r\nour feet! and the glorious sun when rising as if out of a distant water,\r\njust gilding the tops of the mountains, and giving life to all nature!\r\nI hope in God, no circumstance may ever make either seek an asylum\r\nfrom grief! With what sincere sympathy I would open every cell of my\r\ncomposition, to receive the effusion of their woes! I would pour my tears\r\ninto their wounds; and if a drop of balm could be found on the top of\r\nthe Cordilleras, or at the remotest sources of the Missouri, I would go\r\nthither myself to seek and to bring it. Deeply practised in the school of\r\naffliction, the human heart knows no joy which I have not lost, no sorrow\r\nof which I have not drunk! Fortune can present no grief of unknown form\r\nto me! Who, then, can so softly bind up the wound of another, as he who\r\nhas felt the same wound himself? But heaven forbid they should ever know a\r\nsorrow! Let us turn over another leaf, for this has distracted me.\r\n\r\n_Head._ Well. Let us put this possibility to trial then, on another\r\npoint. When you consider the character which is given of our country,\r\nby the lying newspapers of London, and their credulous copiers in other\r\ncountries; when you reflect that all Europe is made to believe we are a\r\nlawless banditti, in a state of absolute anarchy, cutting one another's\r\nthroats, and plundering without distinction, how could you expect that any\r\nreasonable creature would venture among us?\r\n\r\n_Heart._ But you and I know that all this is false: that there is not a\r\ncountry on earth, where there is greater tranquillity; where the laws are\r\nmilder, or better obeyed; where every one is more attentive to his own\r\nbusiness, or meddles less with that of others; where strangers are better\r\nreceived, more hospitably treated, and with a more sacred respect.\r\n\r\n_Head._ True, you and I know this, but your friends do not know it.\r\n\r\n_Heart._ But they are sensible people, who think for themselves. They\r\nwill ask of impartial foreigners, who have been among us, whether they\r\nsaw or heard on the spot, any instance of anarchy. They will judge, too,\r\nthat a people, occupied as we are, in opening rivers, digging navigable\r\ncanals, making roads, building public schools, establishing academies,\r\nerecting busts and statues to our great men, protecting religious freedom,\r\nabolishing sanguinary punishments, reforming and improving our laws in\r\ngeneral; they will judge, I say, for themselves, whether these are not the\r\noccupations of a people at their ease; whether this is not better evidence\r\nof our true state, than a London newspaper, hired to lie, and from which\r\nno truth can ever be extracted but by reversing everything it says.\r\n\r\n_Head._ I did not begin this lecture, my friend, with a view to learn from\r\nyou what America is doing. Let us return, then, to our point. I wish to\r\nmake you sensible how imprudent it is to place your affections, without\r\nreserve, on objects you must so soon lose, and whose loss, when it comes,\r\nmust cost you such severe pangs. Remember the last night. You knew your\r\nfriends were to leave Paris to-day. This was enough to throw you into\r\nagonies. All night you tossed us from one side of the bed to the other;\r\nno sleep, no rest. The poor crippled wrist, too, never left one moment\r\nin the same position; now up, now down, now here, now there; was it to be\r\nwondered at, if its pains returned? The surgeon then was to be called, and\r\nto be rated as an ignoramus, because he could not divine the cause of this\r\nextraordinary change. In fine, my friend, you must mend your manners. This\r\nis not a world to live at random in, as you do. To avoid those eternal\r\ndistresses, to which you are forever exposing us, you must learn to look\r\nforward, before you take a step which may interest our peace. Everything\r\nin this world is matter of calculation. Advance then with caution, the\r\nbalance in your hand. Put into one scale the pleasures which any object\r\nmay offer; but put fairly into the other, the pains which are to follow,\r\nand see which preponderates. The making an acquaintance, is not a matter\r\nof indifference. When a new one is proposed to you, view it all round.\r\nConsider what advantages it presents, and to what inconveniences it may\r\nexpose you. Do not bite at the bait of pleasure, till you know there is\r\nno hook beneath it. The art of life is the art of avoiding pain; and he\r\nis the best pilot, who steers clearest of the rocks and shoals with which\r\nit is beset. Pleasure is always before us; but misfortune is at our side:\r\nwhile running after that, this arrests us. The most effectual means of\r\nbeing secure against pain, is to retire within ourselves, and to suffice\r\nfor our own happiness. Those which depend on ourselves, are the only\r\npleasures a wise man will count on: for nothing is ours, which another may\r\ndeprive us of. Hence the inestimable value of intellectual pleasures. Ever\r\nin our power, always leading us to something new, never cloying, we ride\r\nserene and sublime above the concerns of this mortal world, contemplating\r\ntruth and nature, matter and motion, the laws which bind up their\r\nexistence, and that Eternal Being who made and bound them up by those\r\nlaws. Let this be our employ. Leave the bustle and tumult of society to\r\nthose who have not talents to occupy themselves without them. Friendship\r\nis but another name for an alliance with the follies and the misfortunes\r\nof others. Our own share of miseries is sufficient: why enter then as\r\nvolunteers into those of another? Is there so little gall poured into our\r\ncup, that we must need help to drink that of our neighbor? A friend dies,\r\nor leaves us: we feel as if a limb was cut off. He is sick: we must watch\r\nover him, and participate of his pains. His fortune is shipwrecked: ours\r\nmust be laid under contribution. He loses a child, a parent, or a partner:\r\nwe must mourn the loss as if it were our own.\r\n\r\n_Heart._ And what more sublime delight than to mingle tears with one whom\r\nthe hand of heaven hath smitten! to watch over the bed of sickness, and\r\nto beguile its tedious and its painful moments! to share our bread with\r\none to whom misfortune has left none! This world abounds indeed with\r\nmisery; to lighten its burthen, we must divide it with one another. But\r\nlet us now try the virtue of your mathematical balance, and as you have\r\nput into one scale the burthens of friendship, let me put its comforts\r\ninto the other. When languishing then under disease, how grateful is the\r\nsolace of our friends! how are we penetrated with their assiduities and\r\nattentions! how much are we supported by their encouragements and kind\r\noffices! When heaven has taken from us some object of our love, how sweet\r\nis it to have a bosom whereon to recline our heads, and into which we may\r\npour the torrent of our tears! Grief, with such a comfort, is almost a\r\nluxury! In a life, where we are perpetually exposed to want and accident,\r\nyours is a wonderful proposition, to insulate ourselves, to retire from\r\nall aid, and to wrap ourselves in the mantle of self-sufficiency! For,\r\nassuredly, nobody will care for him who cares for nobody. But friendship\r\nis precious, not only in the shade, but in the sunshine of life; and\r\nthanks to a benevolent arrangement of things, the greater part of life\r\nis sunshine. I will recur for proof to the days we have lately passed.\r\nOn these, indeed, the sun shone brightly. How gay did the face of nature\r\nappear! Hills, valleys, chateaux, gardens, rivers, every object wore\r\nits liveliest hue! Whence did they borrow it? From the presence of our\r\ncharming companion. They were pleasing, because she seemed pleased. Alone,\r\nthe scene would have been dull and insipid: the participation of it with\r\nher gave it relish. Let the gloomy monk, sequestered from the world,\r\nseek unsocial pleasures in the bottom of his cell! Let the sublimated\r\nphilosopher grasp visionary happiness, while pursuing phantoms dressed\r\nin the garb of truth! Their supreme wisdom is supreme folly; and they\r\nmistake for happiness the mere absence of pain. Had they ever felt the\r\nsolid pleasure of one generous spasm of the heart, they would exchange\r\nfor it all the frigid speculations of their lives, which you have been\r\nvaunting in such elevated terms. Believe me, then, my friend, that that\r\nis a miserable arithmetic which could estimate friendship at nothing, or\r\nat less than nothing. Respect for you has induced me to enter into this\r\ndiscussion, and to hear principles uttered which I detest and abjure.\r\nRespect for myself now obliges me to recall you into the proper limits\r\nof your office. When nature assigned us the same habitation, she gave us\r\nover it a divided empire. To you, she allotted the field of science; to\r\nme, that of morals. When the circle is to be squared, or the orbit of a\r\ncomet to be traced; when the arch of greatest strength, or the solid of\r\nleast resistance, is to be investigated, take up the problem; it is yours;\r\nnature has given me no cognizance of it. In like manner, in denying to you\r\nthe feelings of sympathy, of benevolence, of gratitude, of justice, of\r\nlove, of friendship, she has excluded you from their control. To these,\r\nshe has adapted the mechanism of the heart. Morals were too essential\r\nto the happiness of man, to be risked on the uncertain combinations of\r\nthe head. She laid their foundation, therefore, in sentiment, not in\r\nscience. That she gave to all, as necessary to all; this to a few only,\r\nas sufficing with a few. I know, indeed, that you pretend authority to\r\nthe sovereign control of our conduct, in all its parts; and a respect for\r\nyour grave saws and maxims, a desire to do what is right, has sometimes\r\ninduced me to conform to your counsels. A few facts, however, which I can\r\nreadily recall to your memory, will suffice to prove to you, that nature\r\nhas not organized you for our moral direction. When the poor, wearied\r\nsoldier whom we overtook at Chickahomony, with his pack on his back,\r\nbegged us to let him get up behind our chariot, you began to calculate\r\nthat the road was full of soldiers, and that if all should be taken\r\nup, our horses would fail in their journey. We drove on therefore. But,\r\nsoon becoming sensible you had made me do wrong, that, though we cannot\r\nrelieve all the distressed, we should relieve as many as we can, I turned\r\nabout to take up the soldier; but he had entered a bye-path, and was no\r\nmore to be found; and from that moment to this, I could never find him\r\nout, to ask his forgiveness. Again, when the poor woman came to ask a\r\ncharity in Philadelphia, you whispered that she looked like a drunkard,\r\nand that half a dollar was enough to give her for the ale-house. Those\r\nwho want the dispositions to give, easily find reasons why they ought\r\nnot to give. When I sought her out afterwards, and did what I should have\r\ndone at first, you know that she employed the money immediately towards\r\nplacing her child at school. If our country, when pressed with wrongs at\r\nthe point of the bayonet, had been governed by its heads instead of its\r\nhearts, where should we have been now? Hanging on a gallows as high as\r\nHaman's. You began to calculate, and to compare wealth and numbers: we\r\nthrew up a few pulsations of our blood; we supplied enthusiasm against\r\nwealth and numbers; we put our existence to the hazard, when the hazard\r\nseemed against us, and we saved our country: justifying, at the same time,\r\nthe ways of Providence, whose precept is, to do always what is right, and\r\nleave the issue to him. In short, my friend, as far as my recollection\r\nserves me, I do not know that I ever did a good thing on your suggestion,\r\nor a dirty one without it. I do forever, then, disclaim your interference\r\nin my province. Fill paper as you please with triangles and squares: try\r\nhow many ways you can hang and combine them together. I shall never envy\r\nnor control your sublime delights. But leave me to decide, when and where\r\nfriendships are to be contracted. You say, I contract them at random. So\r\nyou said the woman at Philadelphia was a drunkard. I receive none into my\r\nesteem, till I know they are worthy of it. Wealth, title, office, are no\r\nrecommendations to my friendship. On the contrary, great good qualities\r\nare requisite to make amends for their having wealth, title, and office.\r\nYou confess, that, in the present case, I could not have made a worthier\r\nchoice. You only object, that I was so soon to lose them. We are not\r\nimmortal ourselves, my friend; how can we expect our enjoyments to be so?\r\nWe have no rose without its thorn; no pleasure without alloy. It is the\r\nlaw of our existence; and we must acquiesce. It is the condition annexed\r\nto all our pleasures, not by us who receive, but by him who gives them.\r\nTrue, this condition is pressing cruelly on me at this moment. I feel\r\nmore fit for death than life. But, when I look back on the pleasures of\r\nwhich it is the consequence, I am conscious they were worth the price I am\r\npaying. Notwithstanding your endeavors, too, to damp my hopes, I comfort\r\nmyself with expectations of their promised return. Hope is sweeter than\r\ndespair; and they were too good to mean to deceive me. \"In the summer,\"\r\nsaid the gentleman; but \"in the spring,\" said the lady; and I should love\r\nher forever, were it only for that! Know, then, my friend, that I have\r\ntaken these good people into my bosom; that I have lodged them in the\r\nwarmest cell I could find; that I love them, and will continue to love\r\nthem through life; that if fortune should dispose them on one side the\r\nglobe, and me on the other, my affections shall pervade its whole mass\r\nto reach them. Knowing then my determination, attempt not to disturb it.\r\nIf you can, at any time, furnish matter for their amusement, it will be\r\nthe office of a good neighbor to do it. I will, in like manner, seize any\r\noccasion which may offer, to do the like good turn for you with Condorcet,\r\nRittenhouse, Madison, La Cretelle, or any other of those worthy sons of\r\nscience, whom you so justly prize.\r\n\r\nI thought this a favorable proposition whereon to rest the issue of the\r\ndialogue. So I put an end to it by calling for my nightcap. Methinks, I\r\nhear you wish to heaven I had called a little sooner, and so spared you\r\nthe ennui of such a sermon. I did not interrupt them sooner, because I\r\nwas in a mood for hearing sermons. You too were the subject; and on such\r\na thesis, I never think the theme long; not even if I am to write it,\r\nand that slowly and awkwardly, as now, with the left hand. But, that you\r\nmay not be discouraged from a correspondence which begins so formidably,\r\nI will promise you, on my honor, that my future letters shall be of a\r\nreasonable length. I will even agree to express but half my esteem for\r\nyou, for fear of cloying you with too full a dose. But, on your part, no\r\ncurtailing. If your letters are as long as the Bible, they will appear\r\nshort to me. Only let them be brimful of affection. I shall read them with\r\nthe dispositions with which Arlequin, in _Les deux billets_, spelt the\r\nwords \"_je t'aime_,\" and wished that the whole alphabet had entered into\r\ntheir composition.\r\n\r\nWe have had incessant rains since your departure. These make me fear for\r\nyour health, as well as that you had an uncomfortable journey. The same\r\ncause has prevented me from being able to give you any account of your\r\nfriends here. This voyage to Fontainebleau will probably send the Count\r\nde Moutier and the Marquis de Brehan, to America. Danquerville promised\r\nto visit me, but has not done it as yet. De la Tude comes sometimes to\r\ntake family soup with me, and entertains me with anecdotes of his five\r\nand thirty years' imprisonment. How fertile is the mind of man, which can\r\nmake the Bastile and dungeon of Vincennes yield interesting anecdotes!\r\nYou know this was for making four verses on Madame de Pompadour. But I\r\nthink you told me you did not know the verses. They were these: \"_Sans\r\nesprit, sans sentiment, Sans etre belle, ni neuve, En France on peut avoir\r\nle premier amant: Pompadour en est l'epreuve._\" I have read the memoir of\r\nhis three escapes. As to myself, my health is good, except my wrist which\r\nmends slowly, and my mind which mends not at all, but broods constantly\r\nover your departure. The lateness of the season obliges me to decline my\r\njourney into the south of France. Present me in the most friendly terms to\r\nMr. Cosway, and receive me into your own recollection with a partiality\r\nand warmth, proportioned not to my own poor merit, but to the sentiments\r\nof sincere affection and esteem, with which I have the honor to be, my\r\ndear Madam, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. COSWAY.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, October 13, 1786.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MADAM,--Just as I had sealed the enclosed, I received a letter of\r\na good length, dated Antwerp, with your name at the bottom. I prepared\r\nmyself for a feast. I read two or three sentences; looked again at the\r\nsignature to see if I had not mistaken it. It was visibly yours. Read\r\na sentence or two more. Diable! Spelt your name distinctly. There was\r\nnot a letter of it omitted. Began to read again. In fine, after reading\r\na little and examining the signature, alternately, half a dozen times,\r\nI found that your name was to four lines only, instead of four pages. I\r\nthank you for the four lines, however, because they prove you think of\r\nme; little, indeed, but better little than none. To show how much I think\r\nof you, I send you the enclosed letter of three sheets of paper, being\r\na history of the evening I parted with you. But how expect you should\r\nread a letter of three mortal sheets of paper? I will tell you. Divide\r\nit into six doses of half a sheet each, and every day, when the toilette\r\nbegins, take a dose, that is to say, read half a sheet. By this means,\r\nit will have the only merit its length and dulness can aspire to, that\r\nof assisting your _coeffeuse_ to procure you six good naps of sleep. I\r\nwill even allow you twelve days to get through it, holding you rigorously\r\nto one condition only, that is, that at whatever hour you receive this,\r\nyou do not break the seal of the enclosed till the next toilette. Of this\r\ninjunction I require a sacred execution. I rest it on your friendship, and\r\nthat, in your first letter, you tell me honestly whether you have honestly\r\nperformed it. I send you the song I promised. Bring me in return the\r\nsubject, _Jours heureux!_ Were I a songster, I should sing it all to these\r\nwords: \"_Dans ces lieux qu'elle tarde a se rendre!_\" Learn it, I pray you,\r\nand sing it with feeling. My right hand presents its devoirs to you, and\r\nsees, with great indignation, the left supplanting it in a correspondence\r\nso much valued. You will know the first moment it can resume its rights.\r\nThe first exercise of them shall be addressed to you, as you had the first\r\nessay of its rival. It will yet, however, be many a day. Present my esteem\r\nto Mr. Cosway, and believe me to be yours very affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE CORNY.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, October 20, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--By the first conveyance which shall offer, I propose to report\r\nto the Governor of Virginia the manner in which the wish of the State,\r\nrelative to the bust of the Marquis de La Fayette, has been carried\r\ninto execution, and the very friendly and flattering attentions paid by\r\nMessieurs de Prevot des Marchands, et Echevins de Paris to them and to\r\nthe character to which they desired to show their gratitude. It would\r\nenable us to do this with more exactness could I obtain copies of the\r\nproceedings which attended the inauguration of the bust. Your goodness,\r\nalready so often manifested in this business, encourages me to endeavor to\r\nobtain these through your intervention. I do it the rather as it furnishes\r\nme an occasion very grateful to my feelings, of returning to you at the\r\nsame time my sincere thanks for the zeal with which you have seconded the\r\nviews of the State, the readiness with which you have condescended to give\r\nme information in the course of the proceedings, and to secure by your\r\ninfluence the success of these proceedings. This friendly assistance in\r\nthe discharge of a public duty has added to the many motives of private\r\nesteem and attachment with which I have honor to be, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, October 22, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In a letter of Jan. 2d, I had the honor of communicating to you the\r\nmeasures which had been pursued here for the improvement of the commerce\r\nbetween the United States and France, the general view of that commerce\r\nwhich I had presented to the Chevalier de Vergennes. The circumstance\r\nof the renewal of the forms which had obliged me to press separately\r\nand in the first place the article of tobacco, and that which had also\r\nbrought forward that of whale oil; and, in my letters of May 27th and\r\n31st, I informed you of the result on the first of these articles. During\r\nthe course of the proceedings, a committee had been established for\r\nconsidering the means of promoting the general commerce with America,\r\nand the M. de La Fayette was named of that committee. His influence\r\nin obtaining that establishment was valuable, but his labors and his\r\nperseverance as a member of it became infinitely more so. Immediately\r\nafter the committee of Berni, of which my letter of May 27th gave an\r\naccount, we thought it expedient to bring the general subject of the\r\nAmerican commerce before the committee; and as the members were much\r\nunacquainted with the nature and value of our commercial productions, the\r\nMarquis proposed that, in a letter to him as a member, I should give as\r\nparticular details of them as I could, as a ground for the committee to\r\nproceed on. I did so in the letter, a copy of which I have now the honor\r\nto enclose. The committee were well disposed, and agreed to report, not\r\nonly the general measures which they thought expedient to be adopted, but\r\nthe form of the letter to be written by the minister of finance to me,\r\nfor the communication of those measures. I have received this letter this\r\nmorning and have now the honor to enclose it. I accompany it with the one\r\nproposed by the committee, of which you will perceive that it is almost a\r\nverbal copy; it furnished a proof of the disposition of the King and his\r\nministers to produce a more intimate intercourse between the two nations.\r\nIndeed, I must say that, as far as I am able to see, the friendship of the\r\npeople of this country towards us is cordial and general, and that it is a\r\nkind of security for the friendship of ministers who cannot in any country\r\nbe uninfluenced by the voice of the people. To this we may add, that it\r\nis their interest, as well as ours, to multiply the bans of friendship\r\nbetween us. As the regulations stated in the minister's letter are\r\nimmediately interesting to those concerned in our commerce, I send printed\r\ncopies of it to the sea-port towns in France. We may consider them as an\r\nultimate settlement of the conditions of our commerce with this country;\r\nfor, though the consolidation of the ship duties, and the encouragements\r\nfor the importation of rice are not finally decided, yet the letter\r\ncontains a promise of them so soon as necessary facts shall be known.\r\nWith a view to come at the facts relative to the two last subjects, I had\r\nproposed, whenever I should receive the final decision now enclosed, to\r\navail myself of the pause which that would produce, in order to visit the\r\nsea-port towns with which we trade chiefly, and to collect that kind of\r\nknowledge of our commerce, and of what may be further useful to it, which\r\ncan only be gathered on the spot, and suggested by one's own inspection.\r\nBut the delay which has attended the obtaining the final determination has\r\nbrought us to the entrance of winter, and will oblige me to postpone my\r\njourney to the spring. Besides the objects of public utility which induce\r\nme to make a tour of this land, that of health will oblige me to pay more\r\nattention to exercise and change of air than I have hitherto done since\r\nmy residence in Europe; and I am willing to hope that I may be permitted\r\nat times to absent myself from this place, taking occasions when there\r\nis nothing important on hand, nor likely to arise. The assistance of\r\nthe M. de La Fayette in the whole of this business, has been so earnest\r\nand so efficacious, that I am in duty bound to place it under the eye\r\nof Congress, as worthy their notice on this occasion. Their thanks, or\r\nsuch other notice as they think proper, would be grateful to him without\r\ndoubt. He has richly deserved and will continue to deserve it, whenever\r\noccasions shall arise of rendering service to the United States. These\r\noccasions will continually occur. Though the abolition of the monopoly\r\nof our tobacco cannot be hoped under the present circumstances, changes\r\nare possible which may open that hope again. However jealous, too, this\r\ncountry is of foreign intercourse with their colonies, that intercourse is\r\ntoo essential to us to be abandoned as desperate. At this moment, indeed,\r\nit cannot be proposed; but, by watching circumstances, occasion may arise\r\nhereafter; and I hope will arise. I know from experience what would, in\r\nthat case, be the value of such an auxiliary.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO H. E. J. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, October 27, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I formerly had the honor of mentioning to you the measures I\r\nhad taken to have our commerce with this country put on a better footing,\r\nand you know the circumstances which had occasioned the articles of\r\nwhale oil and tobacco to be first brought forward. Latterly we got the\r\ncommittee, which had been established for this purpose, to take up the\r\nother article, and on their report, the King and council have come to the\r\ndecisions explained in the enclosed letter from M. de Calonnes[A] to me.\r\nThe abandonment of revenue raised on articles of _importation_ shows a\r\nfriendly disposition. I have had, through this business, a most zealous\r\nand powerful auxiliary in the Marquis de La Fayette, by whose activity\r\nit has been sooner and better done than I could otherwise have possibly\r\nexpected. Though you are free to show the enclosed letter as you please,\r\nI would wish it kept out of the public papers two or three months. I am,\r\ndear Sir, your affectionate friend and servant.\r\n\r\n    [A] [French Minister of Finance.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. RAMSAY.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, October 27, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I mentioned to you in a former letter that as the booksellers\r\nin London were afraid to sell your book there, I would have some copies\r\nbrought here, advertising in the London papers that they could be\r\nfurnished weekly from hence by the Diligence. Fifty copies are just\r\narrived, and fifty more are on the way. The translation will come from the\r\npress in a few days.\r\n\r\nHaving observed the immense consumption of rice in this country, it\r\nbecame matter of wonder to me why so few ships come here with that article\r\nfrom South Carolina and Georgia. The information I received on my first\r\nenquiries was, that little Carolina rice came here, because it was less\r\nclean and less good than what is brought from the Levant. Further enquiry,\r\nhowever, has satisfied me of the inexactitude of this information. The\r\ncase is as follows. About one-half the rice consumed in France is from\r\nCarolina, the other half is chiefly from Piedmont. The Piedmont rice\r\nis thought by connoisseurs to be the best _au gras_; the Carolina rice\r\nbest _au lait_. Yet the superior whiteness of the latter is so much more\r\npleasing to the eye as to compensate with many purchasers its deficiency\r\nin quality. Carolina rice sells at Havre by wholesale at 22, 23, 24\r\nlivres the French quintal; the livre being 10_d._ sterling, and the French\r\nquintal 109 lbs. English. At the approach of Lent, it rises to 27 livres.\r\nIt is retailed in Paris at from 6 to 10 sous the French pound, according\r\nto its quality, being sorted. Piedmont rice sells always at 10 sous (5_d._\r\nsterling) the pound. In the wholesale it is 3 or 4 livres the quintal\r\ndearer than Carolina rice. This would supplant that of Piedmont, if\r\nbrought in sufficient quantities, and to France directly. But it is first\r\ncarried and deposited in England, and it is the merchant of that country\r\nwho sends it here, drawing a great profit himself, while the commodity is,\r\nmoreover, subjected to the expenses of a double voyage. You will perceive\r\nby the enclosed letter that the government here is disposed to encourage\r\nits importation. I think they will receive it duty free, or under very\r\nslight duty, barely sufficient to indicate the quantity imported. When\r\nI compared the price of this article here with what it is in London or\r\nCharleston, I cannot help hoping the difference will be sufficient to draw\r\nto this country immediately what its consumption would call for. It must\r\ncome to Havre or Rouen, and must arrive there in time to reach Paris by\r\nthe 1st of February, that is to say a month before the Careme, as most\r\npersons lay in their provision of rice during that period. This condition\r\nis so indispensable that it certainly loses its sale if it arrives later.\r\nI send you some specimens of the different kinds of rice as sold here.\r\nIf, by making known these details, you think the intercourse between our\r\ncountry and this may be improved, I am sure you will take on yourself\r\nthe trouble of doing it; nobody being more sensible than you are of the\r\nmotives both moral and political which should induce us to bind the two\r\ncountries together by as many ties as possible of interest and affection.\r\nI cannot pretend to affirm that this country will stand by us on every\r\njust occasion, but I am sure, if this will not, there is no other that\r\nwill. I am, with very great esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n[A CIRCULAR LETTER.]\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, October 29, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I enclose to you the copy of a letter which I have had the honor\r\nto receive from his Excellency, M. de Calonne, one of his majesty's\r\nministers, wherein he is pleased to communicate to me sundry regulations\r\nlately made for the encouragement of the commerce between France and\r\nthe United States of America. The favorable footing on which American\r\nproductions will now be received in the ports of this country will, I\r\nhope, occasion a more general introduction of them, when brought hither.\r\nI equally hope that motives both of interest and gratitude will combine to\r\ninduce the importers to take in exchange the productions of this country.\r\nA commerce carried on by exchange of productions is the most likely\r\nto be lasting and to meet mutual encouragement. You will be pleased to\r\ncommunicate the contents of the enclosed letter to the persons at your\r\nport concerned in the American trade, but so that it may not get into the\r\npublic papers. You will observe that the article of rice and ship duties\r\nare still to be provided for. I shall be obliged to you if you will inform\r\nme what duties are paid on American rice on its importation into your\r\nport, and to give me a distinct detail of the several port duties and ship\r\nduties paid by American vessels thither, noting on what or by what name\r\nthey are payable, the amount, for whose profit they are, by what title\r\nthey are received, and the laws which authorized them; in order that we\r\nmay be enabled to get these articles settled also. I have the honor to be,\r\nwith great esteem, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE CALONNE.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, November 2, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have been honored with your Excellency's letter of October the\r\n22d, wherein you communicate to me the regulations which his majesty,\r\nthe King, has been pleased lately to establish in favor of the commerce\r\nbetween his subjects and the citizens of the United States. I avail myself\r\nof the first occasion of conveying this information to Congress, who\r\nwill receive with singular satisfaction this new proof of his majesty's\r\nfriendship and of his willingness to multiply the ties of interest and\r\nintercourse between the two nations. Favors are doubly precious which,\r\npromoting the present purposes of interest and of friendship, enlarge\r\nthe foundations for their continuance and increase. The part which\r\nyour Excellency has been pleased to take in the establishment of these\r\nregulations, merits and meets my sincere thanks, and adds a little the\r\nmore to those sentiments of profound esteem and respect with which I have\r\nthe honor to be, your Excellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE CREVECŒUR.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, November 6, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Congress have as yet come to no resolution as to the general\r\nredemption of paper money. That it is to be redeemed is a principle of\r\nwhich there is no doubt in the mind of any member of Congress, nor of\r\nany citizen of the United States. A resolution of Congress taken in a\r\nparticular case, which stood on the same ground on which the general one\r\nwill stand, founds a presumption amounting nearly to a certainty that\r\nthey will pay to the holder of every bill what it cost him, or the person\r\nwhom he represents at the time of receiving it, with an interest from\r\nthat time, of six per cent. They have of course established no rule of\r\nevidence as to the time of receiving the money. I think, however, that it\r\nwould be advisable for M. de Lisle, or the representatives of Pileerf, to\r\nestablish the time at which their money was received by the affidavits of\r\nsuch persons as know it. Those of disinterested persons would be best;\r\nbut if there is no disinterested person acquainted with the fact, they\r\nwill do well to take the affidavits of persons interested. It is probable\r\nthis kind of testimony will be admitted; at any rate it can do no harm,\r\nno particular form nor no terms of art are required for these affidavits.\r\nIt will suffice if they state facts substantially, and that the oath be\r\nadministered by some person who, by the laws of the country in which it is\r\nadministered, is authorized to administer an oath. I have the honor to be,\r\nSir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DU RIVAL.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, November 7, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am honored with your letter of the 1st instant, enclosing\r\ninquiries on the subject of the coins of the United States. Some time\r\nduring the last year, Congress decided that the Spanish milled dollar\r\nshould be their money unit, and that their coins should be in a decimal\r\nprogression above or below that. Some intermediate coins will also be\r\ndoubtless made for convenience, and indeed they determined that their\r\nsmallest copper coin should be the two-hundredth part of a dollar. They\r\ndid not determine how much pure silver their money unit should contain,\r\nnor establish the proportion between their silver and gold coins. No other\r\nresolutions were entered into, nor had anything been done to effectuate\r\nthese. What is said, therefore, on this subject in the Courier d'Europe is\r\nentirely fable, unless the compiler of that paper has received information\r\nof a later date than the middle of August. I do expect that Congress will\r\nsometime soon complete their system or resolutions on this subject, and\r\ncarry them into effect.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiment of the highest respect, Sir, your\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. I omitted to observe that most of the gold and silver coins of\r\nEurope pass in the several States of America according to the quantity of\r\npure metal they contain.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. FAMIN.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, November 11, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--This will be handed you by Colonel Blackden, heretofore an officer\r\nin the American army--at present engaged in trade. He goes to Honfleur\r\nwith a view to examine the commercial relations which may be established\r\nbetween that port and the United States. He wishes particularly to see the\r\nnature of its harbor, the conveniences already established for commerce,\r\nand to know something of the productions which can be taken and given\r\nthere in exchange. Knowing your desire to assist in drawing the American\r\ncommerce to that port, I take the liberty of recommending this gentleman\r\nto your acquaintance, and of praying you to procure him the information he\r\ndesires.\r\n\r\nSome late regulations of the King and Council in favor of the commerce\r\nof the United States having given us room to hope that our endeavors may\r\nbe successful to remove a good part of it from Great Britain to France,\r\nHonfleur presents itself as a more important instrument for this purpose\r\nthan it had heretofore appeared. We are, therefore, now pressing more\r\nearnestly its establishment as a free port, and such other regulations in\r\nits favor as may invite the commerce to it.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE MR. JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, November 12, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In a letter which I had the honor of writing you on the 26th of\r\nSeptember, I informed you that a Dutch company were making propositions\r\nto the Minister of Finance here to purchase at a discount, the debt due\r\nfrom the United States to this country. I have lately procured a copy\r\nof their memoir which I now enclose. Should Congress think this subject\r\nworthy their attention, they have no time to lose, as the necessities\r\nof the minister, which alone has made him listen to this proposition,\r\nmay force him to a speedy conclusion. The effect which a payment of the\r\nwhole sum would have here, would be very valuable. The only question\r\nis, whether we can borrow it in Holland, a question which cannot be\r\nresolved but in Holland. The trouble of the trial, and the expense of\r\nthe transaction, would be well repaid by the dispositions which would be\r\nexcited in our favor in the King and his ministers. I have the honor to\r\nbe, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. LE ROY DE L'ACADEMIE DES SCIENCES.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, November 13, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I received the honor of yours of September the 18th, a day or two\r\nafter the accident of a dislocated wrist had disabled me from writing. I\r\nhave waited thus long in constant hope of recovering its use. But finding\r\nthat this hope walks before me like my shadow, I can no longer oppose the\r\ndesire and duty of answering your polite and learned letter. I therefore\r\nemploy my left hand in the office of scribe, which it performs indeed\r\nslowly, awkwardly and badly.\r\n\r\nThe information given by me to the Marquis de Chastellux, and alluded to\r\nin his book and in your letter was, that the sea breezes which prevail\r\nin the lower parts of Virginia during the summer months, and in the warm\r\nparts of day, had made a sensible progress into the interior country:\r\nthat formerly, within the memory of persons living, they extended but\r\nlittle above Williamsburg; that afterwards they became sensible as high\r\nas Richmond; and that, at present, they penetrate sometimes as far as the\r\nfirst mountains, which are above an hundred miles further from the sea\r\ncoast than Williamsburg is. It is very rare, indeed, that they reach those\r\nmountains, and not till the afternoon is considerably advanced. A light\r\nnorth-westerly breeze is, for the most part, felt there, while an easterly\r\nor north-easterly wind is blowing strongly in the lower country. How far\r\nnorthward and southward of Virginia this easterly breeze takes place, I am\r\nnot informed. I must, therefore, be understood as speaking of that State\r\nonly, which extends on the sea coast from 36½ to 38 of latitude.\r\n\r\nThis is the fact. We know too little of the operations of nature in the\r\nphysical world to assign causes with any degree of confidence. Willing\r\nalways, however, to guess at what we do not know, I have sometimes\r\nindulged myself with conjectures on the causes of the phenomena above\r\nstated. I will hazard them on paper for your amusement, premising for\r\ntheir foundation some principles believed to be true.\r\n\r\nAir resting on a heated and reflecting surface, becomes warmer, rarer and\r\nlighter? it ascends therefore, and the circumjacent air, which is colder\r\nand heavier, flows into its place, becomes warmed and, lightened in its\r\nturn, ascends, and is succeeded as that which went before. If the heated\r\nsurface be circular, the air flows to it from every quarter, like the\r\nrays of a circle to its centre. If it be a zone of determinate breadth and\r\nindefinite length, the air will flow from each side perpendicularly on it.\r\nIf the currents of air flowing from opposite sides, be of equal force,\r\nthey will meet in equilibrio, at a line drawn longitudinally through\r\nthe middle of the zone. If one current be stronger than the other, the\r\nstronger one will force back the line of equilibrium towards the further\r\nedge of the zone, or even beyond it: the motion it has acquired causing it\r\nto overshoot the zone, as the motion acquired by a pendulum in its descent\r\ncauses it to vibrate beyond the point of its lowest descent.\r\n\r\nEarth, exposed naked to the sun's rays, absorbs a good portion of them;\r\nbut, being an opaque body, those rays penetrate to a small depth only.\r\nIts surface, by this accumulation of absorbed rays, becomes considerably\r\nheated. The residue of the rays are reflected into the air resting on that\r\nsurface. This air, then, is warmed, 1, by the _direct_ rays of the sun; 2,\r\nby its _reflected_ rays; 3, by _contact_ with the heated surface. A forest\r\nreceiving the sun's rays, a part of them enters the intervals between\r\nthe trees, and their reflection upwards is intercepted by the leaves and\r\nboughs. The rest fall on the trees, the leaves of which being generally\r\ninclined towards the horizon, reflect the rays downwards. The atmosphere\r\nhere, then, receives little or no heat by reflection. Again, these leaves\r\nhaving a power of keeping themselves cool by their own transpiration, they\r\nimpart no heat to the air by contact. Reflection and contact, then, two of\r\nthe three modes before-mentioned of communicating heat, are wanting here;\r\nand of course, the air over a country covered by forest must be colder\r\nthan that over cultivated grounds.\r\n\r\nThe sea being pellucid, the sun's rays penetrate it to a considerable\r\ndepth. Being also fluid, and in perpetual agitation, its parts are\r\nconstantly mixed together; so that, instead of its heat being all\r\naccumulated in its surface, as in the case of a solid opaque body, it is\r\ndiffused through its whole mass. Its surface, therefore, is comparatively\r\ncool, for these reasons, to which may be added that of evaporation. The\r\nsmall degree of reflection which might otherwise take place, is generally\r\nprevented by the rippled state of its surface. The air resting on the\r\nsea, then, like that resting on a forest, receives little or no heat by\r\nreflection or contact, and is therefore colder than that which lies over a\r\ncultivated country.\r\n\r\nTo apply these observations to the phenomena under consideration. The\r\nfirst settlements of Virginia were made along the sea coast, bearing from\r\nthe south towards the north, a little eastwardly. These settlements formed\r\na zone, in which, though every point was not cleared of its forest, yet\r\na good proportion was cleared and cultivated. The cultivated earth, as\r\nthe sun advances above the horizon in the morning, acquires from it an\r\nintense heat, which is retained and increased through the warm parts of\r\nthe day. The air, resting on it, becomes warm in proportion, and rises.\r\nOn one side is a country still covered with forest, on the other is the\r\nocean. The colder air from both of these then rushes towards the heated\r\nzone to supply the place left vacant there by the ascent of the warm\r\nair. The breeze from the west is light and feeble, because it traverses\r\na country covered with mountains and forests, which retard its current.\r\nThat from the east is strong, as passing over the ocean, wherein there is\r\nno obstacle to its motion. It is probable, therefore, that this easterly\r\nbreeze forces itself far into or perhaps beyond the zone which produces\r\nit. This zone is, by the increase of population, continually widening into\r\nthe interior country. The line of equilibrium between the easterly and\r\nwesterly breezes is, therefore, progressive.\r\n\r\nDid no foreign causes intervene, the sea breeze would be a little\r\nsouthwardly of the east, that direction being perpendicular to our\r\ncoast. But within the tropics, there are winds which blow continually\r\nand strongly from the east. This current affects the course of the air,\r\neven without the tropics. The same cause, too, which produces a strong\r\nmotion of the air from east to west, between the tropics, to wit, the\r\nsun, exercises its influence without those limits, but more freely, in\r\nproportion as the surface of the globe is there more obliquely presented\r\nto its rays. This effect, though not great, is not to be neglected when\r\nthe sun is in, or near our summer solstice, which is the season of these\r\neasterly breezes. The northern air, too, flowing towards the equatorial\r\nparts, to supply the vacuum made there by the ascent of their heated\r\nair, has only the small rotatory motion of the polar latitudes from\r\nwhich it comes. Nor does it suddenly acquire the swifter rotation of\r\nthe parts into which it enters. This gives it the effect of a motion\r\nopposed to that of the earth, that is to say, of an easterly one. And\r\nall these causes together, are known to produce currents of air in the\r\nAtlantic, varying from east to north-east, as far as the fortieth degree\r\nof latitude. It is this current which presses our sea breeze out of its\r\nnatural south-easterly direction, to an easterly, and sometimes almost a\r\nnorth-easterly one.\r\n\r\nWe are led naturally to ask, where the progress of our sea breezes will\r\nultimately be stopped? No confidence can be placed in any answer to\r\nthis question. If they should ever pass the mountainous country which\r\nseparates the waters of the ocean from those of the Mississippi, there\r\nmay be circumstances which might aid their further progress, as far as\r\nthe Mississippi. That mountainous country commences about two hundred\r\nmiles from the sea coast, and consists of successive ranges passing\r\nfrom north-east to south-west, and rising the one above the other to the\r\nAlleghany Ridge, which is the highest of all. From that, lower and lower\r\nridges succeed one another again, till having covered in the whole, a\r\nbreadth of two hundred miles from southeast to northwest, they subside\r\ninto a plain, fertile country, extending four hundred miles to the\r\nMississippi, and probably much further on the other side, towards the\r\nheads of the western waters. When this country shall become cultivated,\r\nit will, for the reasons before explained, draw to it winds from the east\r\nand west. In this case, should the sea breezes pass the intermediate\r\nmountains, they will rather be aided than opposed in their further\r\nprogress to the Mississippi. There are circumstances, however, which\r\nrender it possible that they may not be able to pass those intermediate\r\nmountains. 1. These mountains constitute the highest lands within the\r\nUnited States. The air on them must consequently be very cold and heavy,\r\nand have a tendency to flow both to the east and west. 2. Ranging across\r\nthe current of the sea breezes, they are in themselves so many successive\r\nbarriers opposed to their progress. 3. The country they occupy is covered\r\nwith trees, which assist to weaken and spend the force of the breezes. 4.\r\nIt will remain so covered; a very small proportion of it being capable of\r\nculture. 5. The temperature of the air, then, will never be softened by\r\nculture.\r\n\r\nWhether in the plain country between the Mississippi and Alleghany\r\nmountains, easterly or westerly winds prevail at present, I am not\r\ninformed. I conjecture, however, that they must be westerly; and I think\r\nwith you, Sir, that if those mountains were to subside into plain country,\r\nas their opposition to the westerly winds would then be removed, they\r\nwould repress more powerfully those from the east, and of course would\r\nremove the line of equilibrium nearer to the sea coast for the present.\r\n\r\nHaving had occasion to mention the course of the tropical winds from east\r\nto west, I will add some observations connected with them. They are known\r\nto occasion a strong current in the ocean, in the same direction. This\r\ncurrent breaks on that wedge of land of which Saint Roque is the point;\r\nthe southern column of it _probably_ turning off and washing the coast\r\nof Brazil. I say _probably_, because I have never heard of the fact, and\r\nconjecture it from reason only. The northern column having its western\r\nmotion diverted towards the north, and reinforced by the currents of\r\nthe great rivers Orinoko, Amazons and Tocantin, has probably been the\r\nagent which formed the Gulf of Mexico, cutting the American continent\r\nnearly in two, in that part. It re-issues into the ocean at the northern\r\nend of the Gulf, and passes by the name of the Gulf Stream, all along\r\nthe coast of the United States, to its northern extremity. There it\r\nturns off eastwardly, having formed by its eddy at this turn the Banks\r\nof Newfoundland. Through the whole of its course, from the Gulf to the\r\nBanks, it retains a very sensible warmth. The Spaniards are, at this time,\r\ndesirous of trading to the Philippine islands, by the way of the Cape of\r\nGood Hope; but opposed in it by the Dutch, under authority of the treaty\r\nof Munster, they are examining the practicability of a common passage\r\nthrough the Straights of Magellan or round Cape Horn. Were they to make\r\nan opening through the Isthmus of Panama, a work much less difficult than\r\nsome even of the inferior canals of France, however small this opening\r\nshould be in the beginning, the tropical current, entering it with all\r\nits force, would soon widen it sufficiently for its own passage, and thus\r\ncomplete, in a short time, that work which otherwise will still employ it\r\nfor ages. Less country, too, would be destroyed by it in this way. These\r\nconsequences would follow: 1. Vessels from Europe or the western coast\r\nof Africa, by entering the tropics, would have a steady wind and tide to\r\ncarry them through the Atlantic, through America and the Pacific ocean, to\r\nevery part of the Asiatic coast, and of the eastern coast of Africa; thus\r\nperforming with speed and safety the tour of the whole globe, to within\r\nabout twenty-four degrees of longitude, or one fifteenth part of its\r\ncircumference; the African continent, under the line, occupying about that\r\nspace. 2. The Gulf of Mexico, now the most dangerous navigation in the\r\nworld on account of its currents and movable sands, would become stagnant\r\nand safe. 3. The Gulf Stream on the coast of the United States would\r\ncease, and with that those derangements of course and reckoning, which now\r\nimpede and endanger the intercourse with those States. 4. The fogs on the\r\nBanks of Newfoundland,[B] supposed to be the vapors of the Gulf Stream,\r\nrendered turbid by cold air, would disappear. 5. Those Banks ceasing to\r\nreceive supplies of sand, weeds, and warm water, by the Gulf Stream, it\r\nmight become problematical what effect changes of pasture and temperature\r\nwould have on the fisheries. However, it is time to relieve you from this\r\nlong lecture. I wish its subject may have been sufficiently interesting,\r\nto make amends for its details. These are submitted with entire deference\r\nto your better judgment. I will only add to them, by assuring you of the\r\nsentiments of perfect esteem and respect with which I have the honor to\r\nbe, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n    [B] This ingenious and probable conjecture, I found in a letter\r\n    from Dr. Franklin to yourself, published in the late volume of the\r\n    American Philosophical Transactions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, November 14, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The house of Le Coulteux, which for some centuries has been the\r\nwealthiest of this place, has it in contemplation to establish a great\r\ncompany for the fur trade. They propose that partners interested one half\r\nin the establishment, should be American citizens, born and residing in\r\nthe United States. Yet if I understood them rightly, they expect that\r\nthat half of the company which resides here, should make the greatest\r\npart, or perhaps the whole of the advances, while those on our side the\r\nwater should superintend the details. They had, at first, thought of\r\nBaltimore as the centre of their American transactions. I have pointed\r\nout to them the advantages of Alexandria for this purpose. They have\r\nconcluded to take information as to Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New\r\nYork, for a principal deposit, and having no correspondent at Alexandria,\r\nhave asked me to procure a state of the advantages of that place, as\r\nalso to get a recommendation of the best merchant there, to be adopted as\r\npartner and head of the business there. Skill, punctuality and integrity\r\nare the requisites in such a character. They will decide on their whole\r\ninformation, as to the place for their principal factory. Being unwilling\r\nthat Alexandria should lose its pretensions, I have undertaken to procure\r\nthem information as to that place. If they undertake this trade at all, it\r\nwill be on so great a scale as to decide the current of the Indian trade\r\nto the place they adopt. I have no acquaintance at Alexandria or in its\r\nneighborhood; but, believing you would feel an interest in the matter,\r\nfrom the same motives which I do, I venture to ask the favor of you to\r\nrecommend to me a proper merchant for their purpose, and to engage some\r\nwell-informed person to send me a representation of the advantages of\r\nAlexandria, as the principal deposit of the fur trade.\r\n\r\nThe author of the political part of the Encyclopedie Methodique desired\r\nme to examine his article, \"Etats Unis.\" I did so. I found it a tissue\r\nof errors; for, in truth, they know nothing about us here. Particularly,\r\nhowever, the article \"Cincinnati\" was a mere philippic against that\r\ninstitution; in which it appeared that there was an utter ignorance\r\nof facts and motives. I gave him notes on it. He reformed it, as he\r\nsupposed, and sent it again to me to revise. In this reformed state,\r\nColonel Humphreys saw it. I found it necessary to write that article for\r\nhim. Before I gave it to him, I showed it to the Marquis de La Fayette,\r\nwho made a correction or two. I then sent it to the author. He used the\r\nmaterials, mixing a great deal of his own with them. In a work, which\r\nis sure of going down to the latest posterity, I thought it material to\r\nset facts to rights as much as possible. The author was well disposed;\r\nbut could not entirely get the better of his original bias. I send you\r\nthe article as ultimately published. If you find any material errors in\r\nit, and will be so good as to inform me of them, I shall probably have\r\nopportunities of setting this author to rights. What has heretofore passed\r\nbetween us on this institution, makes it my duty to mention to you, that\r\nI have never heard a person in Europe, learned or unlearned, express his\r\nthoughts on this institution, who did not consider it as dishonorable\r\nand destructive to our governments; and that every writing which has come\r\nout since my arrival here, in which it is mentioned, considers it, even\r\nas now reformed, as the germ whose development is one day to destroy the\r\nfabric we have reared. I did not apprehend this, while I had American\r\nideas only. But I confess that what I have seen in Europe has brought me\r\nover to that opinion; and that though the day may be at some distance,\r\nbeyond the reach of our lives perhaps, yet it will certainly come,\r\nwhen a single fibre left of this institution will produce an hereditary\r\naristocracy, which will change the form of our governments from the best\r\nto the worst in the world. To know the mass of evil which flows from this\r\nfatal source, a person must be in France; he must see the finest soil, the\r\nfinest climate, the most compact State, the most benevolent character of\r\npeople, and every earthly advantage combined, insufficient to prevent this\r\nscourge from rendering existence a curse to twenty-four out of twenty-five\r\nparts of the inhabitants of this country. With us, the branches of this\r\ninstitution cover all the States. The southern ones, at this time, are\r\naristocratical in their dispositions; and, that that spirit should grow\r\nand extend itself, is within the natural order of things. I do not flatter\r\nmyself with the immortality of our governments; but I shall think little\r\nalso of their longevity, unless this germ of destruction be taken out.\r\nWhen the society themselves shall weigh the possibility of evil, against\r\nthe impossibility of any good to proceed from this institution, I cannot\r\nhelp hoping they will eradicate it. I know they wish the permanence of our\r\ngovernments, as much as any individuals composing them.\r\n\r\nAn interruption here, and the departure of the gentleman by whom I send\r\nthis, oblige me to conclude it, with assurances of the sincere respect and\r\nesteem with which I have the honor to be, dear Sir, your most obedient,\r\nand most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR CHAS.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, December 7, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I should with great pleasure have perused your manuscript of the\r\nhistory of the American Revolution, but that it comes to me in the moment\r\nof my setting out on a journey into the south of France, where I am to\r\npass the winter. In the few moments of leisure which my preparations for\r\nthat journey admitted, I have read some detached parts, and find that\r\nit would have been very interesting to me. In one of these (page 60), I\r\nhave taken the liberty of noting a circumstance which is not true, and to\r\nwhich I believe M. d'Aubertueil first gave a place in history. In page\r\n75, I observe it says that Congress removed to Hartford, but this is a\r\nmisinformation. They never sat there. In general, I would observe to you,\r\nthat where there is no other authority for a fact than the history of\r\nD'Aubertueil, it will not be safe to hazard it. These authors have been\r\nled into an infinitude of errors, probably by trusting to the English\r\npapers, or to the European ones, copied from them. It is impossible to\r\nresort to a more impure source. I am much pleased to find, that you concur\r\nin the justice of the principles which produced our revolution, and have\r\nonly to wish that I could have been able to go through the whole work. I\r\nhave the honor to be, with much respect, Sir, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DULER.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, December 8, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The circumstance escaped me of my having had the honor of being\r\nmade known to you by Mr. Walker at Charlottesville. However, I should\r\nnot have been the less ready, had it been in my power, to have aided\r\nyou in procuring employment in some bureau here. But a stranger as I am,\r\nunconnected and unacquainted, my solicitations on your behalf would be\r\nas ineffectual as improper. I should have been happy to have been able to\r\nrender you this service, as I am sincerely concerned at the circumstance\r\nwhich has placed you in need of it.\r\n\r\nAs to the paper money in your hands, the States have not yet been able to\r\ntake final arrangements for its redemption. But, as soon as they shall get\r\ntheir finances into some order, they will surely pay for it what it was\r\nworth in silver at the time you received it, with interest. The interest\r\non loan-office certificates is, I think, paid annually in all the States;\r\nand, in some of them, they have begun to make payments of the principal.\r\nThese matters are managed for foreigners by the consul of their nation\r\nin America, where they have not a private friend to attend for them. I\r\nhave the honor to be, Sir, with much respect, your most obedient humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. WILT, DELMESTRE AND CO.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, December 11, 1786.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--Your favor of the 6th instant is duly come to hand, as had\r\ndone that also of the 8th of November. I was much obliged to you for your\r\nobservations and information on the late regulations. I have received and\r\nam still receiving from other quarters, other hints for its improvement.\r\nI cannot propose these to the minister as they arrive, because, besides\r\nthe perpetual fatigue to him, the business would not be so well done\r\nin the end. As soon as all the defects of the new arrangement shall be\r\ndiscovered by a little experience, as well as by their being submitted\r\nto the gentlemen concerned in the commerce, I shall be able, by bringing\r\nall the amendments necessary into a single proposition, to submit them at\r\nonce to the consideration of the minister. It will probably be yet some\r\nmonths before this can be done. In the meantime, we must be contented to\r\nsubmit a little longer to those remnants of burthen which still rest on\r\nour commerce. In this view, I will still thank you for any new hints of\r\namendment which may occur to you in experience, assuring you they shall\r\nbe put to good use, when the occasion shall serve. I have the honor to be,\r\nwith much respect, Gentlemen, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, December 16, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--After a very long silence, I am at length able to write to you.\r\nAn unlucky dislocation of my right wrist, has disabled me from using that\r\nhand, three months. I now begin to use it a little, but with great pain;\r\nso that this letter must be taken up at such intervals as the state of my\r\nhand will permit, and will probably be the work of some days. Though the\r\njoint seems to be well set, the swelling does not abate, nor the use of\r\nit return. I am now, therefore, on the point of setting out to the south\r\nof France, to try the use of some mineral waters there, by immersion. This\r\njourney will be of two or three months.\r\n\r\nI enclose you herein a copy of the letter from the minister of finance\r\nto me, making several advantageous regulations for our commerce. The\r\nobtaining this has occupied us a twelve month. I say us, because I find\r\nthe Marquis de La Fayette so useful an auxiliary, that acknowledgments for\r\nhis co-operation are always due. There remains still something to do for\r\nthe articles of rice, turpentine, and ship duties. What can be done for\r\ntobacco, when the late regulation expires, is very uncertain. The commerce\r\nbetween the United States and this country being put on a good footing,\r\nwe may afterwards proceed to try if anything can be done, to favor our\r\nintercourse with her colonies. Admission into them for our fish and flour,\r\nis very desirable; but, unfortunately, both those articles would raise a\r\ncompetition against their own.\r\n\r\nI find by the public papers, that your commercial convention failed in\r\npoint of representation. If it should produce a full meeting in May, and\r\na broader reformation, it will still be well. To make us one nation as to\r\nforeign concerns, and keep us distinct in domestic ones, gives the outline\r\nof the proper division of powers between the general and particular\r\ngovernments. But, to enable the federal head to exercise the powers\r\ngiven it to best advantage, it should be organized as the particular ones\r\nare, into legislative, executive, and judiciary. The first and last are\r\nalready separated. The second should be. When last with Congress, I often\r\nproposed to members to do this, by making of the committee of the States,\r\nan executive committee during the recess of Congress, and, during its\r\nsessions, to appoint a committee to receive and despatch all executive\r\nbusiness, so that Congress itself should meddle only with what should be\r\nlegislative. But I question if any Congress (much less all successively)\r\ncan have self-denial enough to go through with this distribution. The\r\ndistribution, then, should be imposed on them. I find Congress have\r\nreversed their division of the western States, and proposed to make\r\nthem fewer and larger. This is reversing the natural order of things.\r\nA tractable people may be governed in large bodies; but, in proportion\r\nas they depart from this character, the extent of their government must\r\nbe less. We see into what small divisions the Indians are obliged to\r\nreduce their societies. This measure, with the disposition to shut up\r\nthe Mississippi, gives me serious apprehensions of the severance of the\r\neastern and western parts of our confederacy. It might have been made the\r\ninterest of the western States to remain united with us, by managing their\r\ninterests honestly, and for their own good. But, the moment we sacrifice\r\ntheir interests to our own, they will see it better to govern themselves.\r\nThe moment they resolve to do this, the point is settled. A forced\r\nconnection is neither our interest, nor within our power.\r\n\r\nThe Virginia act for religious freedom has been received with infinite\r\napprobation in Europe, and propagated with enthusiasm. I do not mean by\r\nthe governments, but by the individuals who compose them. It has been\r\ntranslated into French and Italian, has been sent to most of the courts of\r\nEurope, and has been the best evidence of the falsehood of those reports\r\nwhich stated us to be in anarchy. It is inserted in the new Encyclopedie,\r\nand is appearing in most of the publications respecting America. In fact,\r\nit is comfortable to see the standard of reason at length erected, after\r\nso many ages, during which the human mind has been held in vassalage by\r\nkings, priests, and nobles; and it is honorable for us, to have produced\r\nthe first legislature who had the courage to declare, that the reason of\r\nman may be trusted with the formation of his own opinions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI thank you for your communications in Natural History. The several\r\ninstances of trees, &c., found far below the surface of the earth, as in\r\nthe case of Mr. Hay's well, seem to set the reason of man at defiance.\r\n\r\nI am, dear Sir, with sincere esteem, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES THOMPSON.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, December 17, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--A dislocation of my right wrist has for three months past,\r\ndisabled me from writing except with my left hand, which was too slow\r\nand awkward to be employed often. I begin to have so much use of my\r\nwrist, as to be able to write, but it is slowly, and in pain. I take the\r\nfirst moment I can, however, to acknowledge the receipt of your letters\r\nof April the 6th, July the 8th and 30th. In one of these, you say, you\r\nhave not been able to learn, whether, in the new mills in London, steam\r\nis the immediate mover of the machinery, or raises water to move it? It\r\nis the immediate mover. The power of this agent, though long known, is\r\nbut now beginning to be applied to the various purposes of which it is\r\nsusceptible. You observe that Whitehurst supposes it to have been the\r\nagent, which bursting the earth, threw it up into mountains and valleys.\r\nYou ask me what I think of his book? I find in it many interesting facts\r\nbrought together, and many ingenious commentaries on them. But there are\r\ngreat chasms in his facts, and consequently in his reasoning. These he\r\nfills up by suppositions, which may be as reasonably denied as granted.\r\nA sceptical reader therefore, like myself, is left in the lurch. I\r\nacknowledge, however, he makes more use of fact, than any other writer\r\non a theory of the earth. But I give one answer to all these theorists.\r\nThat is as follows. They all suppose the earth a created existence. They\r\nmust suppose a creator then; and that he possessed power and wisdom to a\r\ngreat degree. As he intended the earth for the habitation of animals and\r\nvegetables, is it reasonable to suppose, he made two jobs of his creation,\r\nthat he first made a chaotic lump and set it into rotatory motion, and\r\nthen waited the millions of ages necessary to form itself? That when it\r\nhad done this, he stepped in a second time, to create the animals and\r\nplants which were to inhabit it? As the hand of a creator is to be called\r\nin, it may as well be called in at one stage of the process as another. We\r\nmay as well suppose he created the earth at once, nearly in the state in\r\nwhich we see it, fit for the preservation of the beings he placed on it.\r\nBut it is said, we have a proof that he did not create it in its present\r\nsolid form, but in a state of fluidity; because its present shape of an\r\noblate spheroid is precisely that which a fluid mass revolving on its axis\r\nwould assume.\r\n\r\nI suppose that the same equilibrium between gravity and centrifugal force,\r\nwhich would determine a fluid mass into the form of an oblate spheroid,\r\nwould determine the wise creator of that mass, if he made it in a solid\r\nstate, to give it the same spheroidical form. A revolving fluid will\r\ncontinue to change its shape, till it attains that in which its principles\r\nof contrary motion are balanced. For if you suppose them not balanced,\r\nit will change its form. Now, the same balanced form is necessary for the\r\npreservation of a revolving solid. The creator, therefore, of a revolving\r\nsolid, would make it an oblate spheroid, that figure alone admitting a\r\nperfect equilibrium. He would make it in that form, for another reason;\r\nthat is, to prevent a shifting of the axis of rotation. Had he created the\r\nearth perfectly spherical its axis might have been perpetually shifting,\r\nby the influence of the other bodies of the system; and by placing the\r\ninhabitants of the earth successively under its poles, it might have\r\nbeen depopulated; whereas, being spheroidical, it has but one axis on\r\nwhich it can revolve in equilibrio. Suppose the axis of the earth to\r\nshift forty-five degrees; then cut it into one hundred and eighty slices,\r\nmaking every section in the plane of a circle of latitude, perpendicular\r\nto the axis: every one of these slices, except the equatorial one, would\r\nbe unbalanced, as there would be more matter on one side of its axis\r\nthan on the other. There could be but one diameter drawn through such a\r\nslice, which would divide it into two equal parts. On every other possible\r\ndiameter, the parts would hang unequal. This would produce an irregularity\r\nin the diurnal rotation. We may, therefore, conclude it impossible for\r\nthe poles of the earth to shift, if it was made spheroidically; and that\r\nit would be made spheroidical, though solid, to obtain this end. I use\r\nthis reasoning only on the supposition that the earth has had a beginning.\r\nI am sure I shall read your conjectures on this subject with great\r\npleasure, though I bespeak, beforehand, a right to indulge my natural\r\nincredulity and scepticism. The pain in which I write awakens me here from\r\nmy reverie, and obliges me to conclude with compliments to Mrs. Thompson,\r\nand assurances to yourself of the esteem and affection with which I am\r\nsincerely, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. Since writing the preceding, I have had a conversation on the\r\nsubject of the steam mills, with the famous Boulton, to whom those of\r\nLondon belong, and who is here at this time. He compares the effect of\r\nsteam with that of horses, in the following manner: Six horses, aided with\r\nthe most advantageous combination of the mechanical powers hitherto tried,\r\nwill grind six bushels of flour in an hour; at the end of which time they\r\nare all in a foam, and must rest. They can work thus, six hours in the\r\ntwenty-four, grinding thirty-six bushels of flour, which is six to each\r\nhorse, for the twenty-four hours. His steam mill in London consumes one\r\nhundred and twenty bushels of coal in twenty-four hours, turns ten pair of\r\nstones, which grind eight bushels of flour an hour each, which is nineteen\r\nhundred and twenty bushels in the twenty-four hours. This makes a peck\r\nand a half of coal perform exactly as much as a horse, in one day, can\r\nperform.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, December 18, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your letters of August the 19th and October the 12th, have come\r\nduly to hand. My last to you was of the 11th of August. Soon after that\r\ndate I got my right wrist dislocated, which has, till now, deprived me\r\nof the use of that hand; and even now, I can use it but slowly, and with\r\npain. The revisal of the Congressional intelligence contained in your\r\nletters, makes me regret the loss of it on your departure. I feel, too,\r\nthe want of a person there, to whose discretion I can trust confidential\r\ncommunications, and on whose friendship I can rely against the unjust\r\ndesigns of malevolence. I have no reason to suppose I have enemies in\r\nCongress; yet it is too possible to be without that fear. Some symptoms\r\nmake me suspect, that my proceedings to redress the abusive administration\r\nof tobacco by the Farmers General have indisposed towards me a powerful\r\nperson in Philadelphia, who was profiting from that abuse. An expression\r\nin the enclosed letter of M. de Calonnes, would seem to imply, that I\r\nhad asked the abolition of Mr. Morris's contract. I never did. On the\r\ncontrary, I always observed to them, that it would be unjust to annul that\r\ncontract. I was led to this, by principles both of justice and interest.\r\nOf interest, because that contract would keep up the price of tobacco\r\nhere, to thirty-four, thirty-six, and thirty-eight livres, from which it\r\nwill fall when it shall no longer have that support. However, I have done\r\nwhat was right, and I will not so far wound my privilege of doing that,\r\nwithout regard to any man's interest, as to enter into any explanations\r\nof this paragraph with him. Yet I esteem him highly, and suppose that\r\nhitherto he had esteemed me. You will see by Calonnes' letter, that we\r\nare doing what we can, to get the trade of the United States put on a\r\ngood footing. I am now about setting out on a journey to the south of\r\nFrance, one object of which is to try the mineral waters there, for the\r\nrestoration of my hand; but another is, to visit all the seaports where we\r\nhave trade, and to hunt up all the inconveniences under which it labors,\r\nin order to get them rectified. I shall visit, and carefully examine too,\r\nthe canal of Languedoc. On my return, which will be early in the spring,\r\nI shall send you several livraisons of the Encyclopedie, and the plan of\r\nyour house. I wish to heaven, you may continue in the disposition to fix\r\nit in Albemarle. Short will establish himself there, and perhaps Madison\r\nmay be tempted to do so. This will be society enough, and it will be the\r\ngreat sweetener of our lives. Without society, and a society to our taste,\r\nmen are never contented. The one here supposed, we can regulate to our\r\nminds, and we may extend our regulations to the sumptuary department,\r\nso as to set a good example to a country which needs it, and to preserve\r\nour own happiness clear of embarrassment. You wish not to engage in the\r\ndrudgery of the bar. You have two asylums from that. Either to accept a\r\nseat in the Council, or in the judiciary department. The latter, however,\r\nwould require a little previous drudgery at the bar, to qualify you to\r\ndischarge your duty with satisfaction to yourself. Neither of these would\r\nbe inconsistent with a continued residence in Albemarle. It is but twelve\r\nhours' drive in a sulky from Charlottesville to Richmond, keeping a fresh\r\nhorse always at the half-way, which would be a small annual expense. I\r\nam in hopes that Mrs. M. will have in her domestic cares, occupation and\r\npleasure, sufficient to fill her time, and insure her against the _tedium\r\nvitæ_: that she will find, that the distractions of a town, and the waste\r\nof life under these, can bear no comparison with the tranquil happiness\r\nof domestic life. If her own experience has not yet taught her this truth,\r\nshe has in its favor the testimony of one who has gone through the various\r\nscenes of business, of bustle, of office, of rambling, and of quiet\r\nretirement, and who can assure her, that the latter is the only point\r\nupon which the mind can settle at rest. Though not clear of inquietudes,\r\nbecause no earthly situation is so, they are fewer in number, and mixed\r\nwith more objects of contentment, than in any other mode of life. But\r\nI must not philosophise too much with her, lest I give her too serious\r\napprehensions of a friendship I shall impose on her. I am with very great\r\nesteem, dear Sir, your sincere friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY MR. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, December 20, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Colonel Franks will have the honor of delivering you the treaty\r\nwith the Emperor of Morocco, and all its appendages. You will perceive,\r\nby Mr. Barclay's letter, that it is not necessary that any body should\r\ngo back to Morocco to exchange ratifications. He says, however, that it\r\nwill be necessary that Fennish receive some testimony that we approve\r\nthe treaty; and as, by the acts of Congress, our signature is necessary\r\nto give validity to it, I have had duplicates of ratifications prepared,\r\nwhich I have signed, and now send you. If you approve and sign them, send\r\none back to me to be forwarded to Fennish, through Mr. Carmichael. Perhaps\r\na joint letter should be written to Fennish; if you think so, be so good\r\nas to write and sign one and send it with the ratification, and I will\r\nsign and forward it. The other ratification is to go to Congress. Colonel\r\nFranks wishes to proceed with the papers to that body. He should do it,\r\nI think, immediately, as Mr. Jay, in a letter to me of October 26th, says\r\nthat Congress have heard through the French Chargé des Affaires, that the\r\ntreaty was signed, and they wonder they have not heard it from us.\r\n\r\nI enclose you a copy of a letter from Mr. Lambe, by which you will\r\nperceive he does not propose to quit Alicant. I will forward the\r\nresolution of Congress to Mr. Carmichael, which was enclosed in yours\r\nof November 30th, to see if that will move him. As the turn of this\r\nresolution admits a construction that Congress may think our original\r\nappointment of him censurable, I have, as in justice I ought, in a letter\r\nto Mr. Jay, taken on myself the blame of having proposed him to you, if\r\nany blame were due. I have enclosed him a copy of my letter to you of\r\nSeptember 24, 1785. Mr. Barclay has proposed to go to Alicant to settle\r\nLambe's accounts, and asked to be strengthened with our authority. If\r\nLambe will obey the resolve of Congress, it will be better to let him go\r\nand settle his account there. But if he will not go back, perhaps it might\r\nnot be amiss for Mr. Barclay to have instructions from us to require a\r\nsettlement, those instructions to be used in that case only. If you think\r\nso, be so good as to write a joint letter and send it to me. But this,\r\nif done at all, should be done immediately. How much money has Lambe\r\ndrawn? I have suggested to Mr. Jay the expediency of putting the Barbary\r\nbusiness into Carmichael's hands, or sending somebody from America, in\r\nconsideration of our separate residence and our distance from the scene of\r\nnegotiation.\r\n\r\nI had seen, without alarm, accounts of the disturbances in the East. But\r\nMr. Jay's letter on the subject had really affected me. However, yours\r\nsets me to rights. I can never fear that things will go far wrong where\r\ncommon sense has fair play. I but just begin to use my pen a little with\r\nmy right hand, but with pain. Recommending myself, therefore, to the\r\nfriendship of Mrs. Adams, I must conclude here with assurances of the\r\nsincere esteem of, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. Should a Mr. Maury, of Virginia, but now a merchant of Liverpool,\r\npresent himself to you, I recommend him to your notice, as my old\r\nschool-fellow, and a man of the most solid integrity.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HOPKINSON.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, December 23, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My last letter to you was dated August 14th. Yours of May 27th\r\nand June 28th, were not then received, but have been since. I take the\r\nliberty of putting under your cover another letter to Mrs. Champis, as\r\nalso an inquiry after a Dr. Griffiths. A letter to M. le Vieillard, from\r\nthe person he had consulted about the essence L'Orient, will convey to\r\nyou the result of my researches into that article. Your spring-block for\r\nassisting a vessel in sailing cannot be tried here, because the Seine,\r\nbeing not more than about forty toises wide, and running swiftly, there\r\nis no such thing on it as a vessel with sails. I thank you for the volume\r\nof the Philadelphia transactions, which came safely to hand, and is, in\r\nmy opinion, a very valuable volume, and contains many precious papers.\r\nThe paccan-nut is, as you conjecture, the Illinois nut. The former is the\r\nvulgar name south of the Potomac, as also with the Indians and Spaniards,\r\nand enters also into the Botanical name which is Juglano Paccan. I have\r\nmany volumes of the Encyclopedie for yourself and Dr. Franklin; but, as\r\na winter passage is bad for books, and before the spring the packets will\r\nbegin to sail from Havre to New York, I shall detain them till then. You\r\nmust not presume too strongly that your comb-footed bird is known to M.\r\nde Buffon. He did not know our panther. I gave him the stripped skin of\r\none I bought in Philadelphia, and it presents him a new species, which\r\nwill appear in his next volumes. I have convinced him that our deer is\r\nnot a Chevreuil, and would you believe that many letters to different\r\nacquaintances in Virginia, where this animal is so common, have never\r\nenabled me to present him with a large pair of their horns, a blue and red\r\nskin stuffed, to show him their colors, at different seasons. He has never\r\nseen the horns of what we call the elk. This would decide whether it be an\r\nelk or a deer. I am very much pleased with your project on the Harmonica,\r\nand the prospect of your succeeding in the application of keys to it.\r\nIt will be the greatest present which has been made to the musical world\r\nthis century, not excepting the Piano-forte. If its tone approaches that\r\ngiven by the finger as nearly only as the harpsichord does that of the\r\nharp, it will be very valuable. I have lately examined a foot-bass newly\r\ninvented here, by the celebrated Krumfoltz. It is precisely a piano-forte,\r\nabout ten feet long, eighteen inches broad, and nine inches deep. It is\r\nof one octave only, from fa to fa. The part where the keys are, projects\r\nat the side in order to lengthen the levers of the keys. It is placed on\r\nthe floor, and the harpsichord or other piano-forte is set over it, the\r\nfoot acting in concert on that, while the fingers play on this. There\r\nare three unison chords to every note, of strong brass wire, and the\r\nlowest have wire wrapped on them as the lowest in the piano-forte. The\r\nchords give a fine, clear, deep tone, almost like the pipe of an organ.\r\nHave they connected you with our mint? My friend Monroe promised me he\r\nwould take care for you in that, or perhaps the establishment of that at\r\nNew York may have been incompatible with your residence in Philadelphia.\r\nA person here has invented a method of coining the French ecu of six\r\nlivres, so as to strike both faces and the edge at one stroke, and makes\r\na coin as beautiful as a medal. No country has ever yet produced such a\r\ncoin. They are made cheaper too. As yet, he has only made a few to show\r\nthe perfection of his manner. I am endeavoring to procure one to send\r\nto Congress as a model for their coinage. They will consider whether, on\r\nestablishing a new mint, it will be worth while to buy his machines, if\r\nhe will furnish them. A dislocation of my right wrist, which happened to\r\nme about a month after the date of my last letter to you, has disabled\r\nme from writing three months. I do it now in pain, and only in cases of\r\nnecessity, or of strong inclination, having as yet no other use of my\r\nhand. I put under your cover a letter from my daughter to her friend. She\r\njoins me in respects to your good mother, to Mrs. Hopkinson and yourself,\r\nto whom I proffer assurances of the esteem with which I am, dear Sir, your\r\nsincere friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY DR. FRANKLIN.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, December 23, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have received your favor of October 8, but the volume of\r\ntransactions mentioned to come with it, did not; but I had received\r\none from Mr. Hopkinson. You also mention the diplomas it covered for\r\nother persons, and some order of the society relative to myself, which I\r\nsupposed were omitted by accident, and will come by some other conveyance.\r\nSo far as relates to myself, whatever the order was, I beg leave to\r\nexpress to you my sense of their favor, and wish to merit it. I have\r\nseveral livraisons of the Encyclopædie for yourself and Mr. Hopkinson,\r\nwhich shall be sent in the spring, when they will be less liable to\r\ninjury. Some books also which I received from Baron Blome must await that\r\nconveyance. I receive some discouraging accounts of the temper of the\r\npeople in our new government, yet were I to judge only from the accounts\r\ngiven in the public papers, I should not fear their passing over without\r\ninjury. I wish you may have given your opinion of them to some of your\r\nfriends here, as your experience and knowledge of men would give us\r\nmore confidence in your opinion. Russia and the Porte have patched up an\r\naccommodation through the mediation of this court. The coolness between\r\nSpain and Naples will remain, and will occasion the former to cease\r\nintermeddling with the affairs of the latter. The Dutch affairs are still\r\nto be settled. The new King of Prussia is more earnest in supporting the\r\ncause of the slaveholder than his uncle was, and in general an affectation\r\nbegins to show itself of differing from his uncle. There is some fear of\r\nhis throwing himself into the Austrian scale in the European division\r\nof power. Our treaty with Morocco is favorably concluded through the\r\ninfluence of Spain. That with Algiers affords no expectation. We have\r\nbeen rendered anxious here about your health, by hearing you have had a\r\nsevere attack of your gout. Remarkable deaths are the Dutchess of Chabot,\r\nof the House of Rochefoucault, Beaujon, and Peyronet, the architect who\r\nbuilt the bridge of Neuilly, and was to have begun one the next spring\r\nfrom the place Louis XV. to the Palais Bourbon. A dislocated wrist not yet\r\nre-established, obliges me to conclude here with assurances of the perfect\r\nesteem and respect with which I have the honor to be, your Excellency's\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. Will you permit my respects to your grandson, Mr. Franklin, to find\r\ntheir place here?\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. STILES.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, December 24, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I feel myself very much honored by the degree which has been\r\nconferred on me by the Senatus Academicus of Yale College, and I beg\r\nleave, through you, Sir, to express to them how sensible I am of this\r\nhonor, and that it is to their and your indulgence, and not to any merit\r\nof my own, that I am indebted for it.\r\n\r\nThe commotions that have taken place in America, as far as they are yet\r\nknown to me, offer nothing threatening. They are a proof that the people\r\nhave liberty enough, and I could not wish them less than they have. If\r\nthe happiness of the mass of the people can be secured at the expense of\r\na little tempest now and then, or even of a little blood, it will be a\r\nprecious purchase. \"Malo libertatem periculosam quam quietem servitutem.\"\r\nLet common sense and common honesty have fair play, and they will soon set\r\nthings to rights.\r\n\r\nThe bickerings between Russia and the Porte are quieted for the moment.\r\nThe coolness between the Kings of Spain and Naples will remain, but\r\nwill have no other consequence than that of the former withdrawing from\r\ninterference with the affairs of the latter. The present King of Prussia\r\npushes the interest of the Stadtholder more zealously than his uncle did.\r\nThere have been fears that he might throw himself into the Austrian scale,\r\nwhich would greatly derange the European balance. This country is firm in\r\nsupport of the patriotic party in the United Netherlands.\r\n\r\nWe have made an advantageous treaty with Morocco, but with Algiers nothing\r\nis done. From what I learn from the temper of my countrymen and their\r\ntenaciousness of money, it will be more easy to raise ships and men to\r\nfight these pirates into reason than money to bribe them. I wish that\r\nsomething could be done in some form or another to open the Mediterranean\r\nto us. You will have seen that France is endeavoring to relieve and\r\nencourage our commerce with her.\r\n\r\nThe arts and sciences offering nothing new at this moment worth\r\ncommunicating to you, I shall only add assurances of the respect and\r\nesteem with which I have the honor to be, dear Sir, your most obedient,\r\nand most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DUMAS.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, December 25, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--A dislocation of my right wrist has for upwards of three months\r\nprevented my writing to you. I begin to use it a little for the pen; but\r\nit is with great pain. To this cause alone I hope you will ascribe that\r\nI have acknowledged at one time the receipt of so many of your letters.\r\nTheir dates are September 12, 26, October 6, 17, 19, 23, November 3, 17,\r\nDecember 1, and there is one without date. They were communicated to the\r\nMarquis de La Fayette according to your desire, and those to Mr. Jay have\r\nbeen forwarded from time to time as private conveyances occurred, except\r\nsome of the last for which no such conveyance has occurred till now. A\r\ngentleman is setting out for London, and from thence for New York.\r\n\r\nWe receive news from America of collections of the people in three or\r\nfour instances in the Eastern States, demanding delays in the proceedings\r\nof the courts of justice. Those States, as you know, depended before\r\nthe war chiefly on their whale oil and fish. The former was consumed in\r\nLondon, but, being now loaded with heavy duties, cannot go there. Much\r\nof their fish went up the Mediterranean, now shut to us by the piratical\r\nStates. Their debts, therefore, press them, while the means of payment\r\nhave lessened. The mobs, however, separated without a single injury having\r\nbeen offered to the person or property of any one, nor did they continue\r\ntwenty-four hours in any one place. This country has opened a market for\r\ntheir whale oil, and we have made a good treaty of peace with Morocco. But\r\nwith Algiers we can do nothing. An American paper has published a letter,\r\nas from me to the Count de Vergennes, on the subject of our productions of\r\ntobacco and rice. It is surreptitious and falsified; and both the true and\r\nuntrue parts very improper for the public eye. How a newswriter of America\r\ngot at it, is astonishing, and with what views it had been altered. I will\r\nbe much obliged to you if you will endeavor to prevent its publication in\r\nthe Leyden Gazette.\r\n\r\nThe following question I take the liberty of proposing to you\r\nconfidentially. This country wants money in its treasury. Some individuals\r\nhave proposed to buy our debt of twenty-four millions at a considerable\r\ndiscount. I have informed Congress of it, and suggested to them the\r\nexpediency of borrowing this sum in Holland, if possible, as well to\r\nprevent loss to this country as to draw all their money transactions\r\nto one point. But could they borrow the money in Holland? I would be\r\nobliged to you for your opinion on this question, as it would decide me\r\nin pressing this matter further on Congress, or letting it drop. It will\r\nreadily occur to you that the answer should come through the hands of your\r\nambassador here alone. The pain in which I write obliges me, after many\r\nthanks for the interesting details of transactions in your country, to\r\nassure you of the esteem and respect with which I have the honor to be,\r\nSir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, December 26, 1786.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--A note from me of the 22d of September, apprised you it would\r\nbe some time before I should be able to answer your letters. I did not\r\nthen expect it would have been so long.\r\n\r\nI enclose herein a resolution of Congress, recalling Mr. Lambe, which I\r\nwill beg the favor of you to have delivered him. I have written to Mr.\r\nAdams on the subject of directing him to settle with Mr. Barclay, and\r\nattend his answer. In the meantime, I am not without hopes Mr. Barclay has\r\ndone the business. I send also a note desiring Mr. Lambe to deliver you\r\nhis cypher; and a copy of a letter from the minister of finance here, to\r\nme, announcing several regulations in favor of our commerce.\r\n\r\nMy Notes on Virginia, having been hastily written, need abundance of\r\ncorrections. Two or three of these are so material, that I am reprinting\r\na few leaves to substitute for the old. As soon as these shall be ready,\r\nI will beg your acceptance of a copy. I shall be proud to be permitted to\r\nsend a copy, also, to the Count de Campomanes, as a tribute to his science\r\nand his virtues. You will find in them that the Natural Bridge has found\r\nan admirer in me also. I should be happy to make with you the tour of\r\nthe curiosities you will find therein mentioned. That kind of pleasure\r\nsurpasses much, in my estimation, whatever I find on this side the\r\nAtlantic. I sometimes think of building a little hermitage at the Natural\r\nBridge (for it is my property) and of passing there a part of the year at\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nI have received American papers to the 1st of November. Some tumultuous\r\nmeetings of the people have taken place in the eastern States; i.e. one\r\nin Massachusetts, one in Connecticut, and one in New Hampshire. Their\r\nprincipal demand was, a respite in the judiciary proceedings. No injury\r\nwas done, however, in a single instance, to the person or property of any\r\none, nor did the tumult continue twenty-four hours in any one instance.\r\nIn Massachusetts, this was owing to the discretion which the malcontents\r\nstill preserved; in Connecticut and New Hampshire, the body of the people\r\nrose in support of government, and obliged the malcontents to go to\r\ntheir homes. In the last-mentioned State, they seized about forty, who\r\nwere in jail for trial. It is believed this incident will strengthen our\r\ngovernment. Those people are not entirely without excuse. Before the war,\r\nthese States depended on their whale oil and fish. The former was consumed\r\nin England, and much of the latter in the Mediterranean. The heavy duties\r\non American whale oil, now required in England, exclude it from that\r\nmarket; and the Algerines exclude them from bringing their fish into\r\nthe Mediterranean. France is opening her ports for their oil, but in the\r\nmeanwhile, their ancient debts are pressing them, and they have nothing to\r\npay with. The Massachusetts Assembly, too, in their zeal for paying their\r\npublic debt, had laid a tax too heavy to be paid in the circumstances of\r\ntheir State. The Indians seem disposed, too, to make war on us. These\r\ncomplicated causes, determined Congress to increase their forces to\r\ntwo thousand men. The latter was the sole object avowed, yet the former\r\nentered for something into the measure. However, I am satisfied the good\r\nsense of the people is the strongest army our government can ever have,\r\nand that it will not fail them. The commercial convention at Annapolis,\r\nwas not full enough to do business. They found, too, their appointments\r\ntoo narrow, being confined to the article of commerce. They have proposed\r\na meeting in Philadelphia in May, and that it may be authorized to propose\r\namendments of whatever is defective in the federal constitution.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in England, I formed a portable copying press, on the\r\nprinciples of the large one they make here, for copying letters. I had a\r\nmodel made there, and it has answered perfectly. A workman here has made\r\nseveral from that model. The itinerent temper of your court will, I think,\r\nrender one of these useful to you. You must, therefore, do me the favor\r\nto accept of one. I have it now in readiness, and shall send it by the\r\nway of Bayonne, to the care of Mr. Alexander there, unless Don Miguel de\r\nLardizabal can carry it with him.\r\n\r\nMy hand admonishes me it is time to stop, and that I must defer writing to\r\nMr. Barclay till to-morrow.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the highest esteem and respect,\r\ndear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. VAUGHAN.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, December 29, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--When I had the honor of seeing you in London, you were so kind as\r\nto permit me to trouble you sometimes with my letters, and particularly\r\non the subject of mathematical or philosophical instruments. Such a\r\ncorrespondence will be too agreeable to me, and at the same time, too\r\nuseful, not to avail myself of your permission. It has been an opinion\r\npretty generally received among philosophers, that the atmosphere of\r\nAmerica is more humid than that of Europe. Monsieur de Buffon makes this\r\nhypothesis one of the two pillars whereon he builds his system of the\r\ndegeneracy of animals in America. Having had occasion to controvert this\r\nopinion of his, as to the degeneracy of animals there, I expressed a doubt\r\nof the fact assumed, that our climates are more moist. I did not know of\r\nany experiments which might authorize a denial of it. Speaking afterwards\r\non the subject with Dr. Franklin, he mentioned to me the observations\r\nhe had made on a case of magnets, made for him by Mr. Nairne in London.\r\nOf these you will see a detail, in the second volume of the American\r\nPhilosophical Transactions, in a letter from Dr. Franklin to Mr. Nairne,\r\nwherein he recommends to him to take up the principle therein explained,\r\nand endeavor to make an hygrometer, which, taking slowly the temperature\r\nof the atmosphere, shall give its mean degree of moisture, and enable us\r\nthus to make with more certainty, a comparison between the humidities of\r\ndifferent climates. May I presume to trouble you with an inquiry of Mr.\r\nNairne, whether he has executed the Doctor's idea? and if he has, to get\r\nhim to make for me a couple of the instruments he may have contrived.\r\nThey should be made of the same piece, and under like circumstances, that\r\nsending one to America, I may rely on its indications there, compared with\r\nthose of the one I shall retain here. Being in want of a set of magnets\r\nalso, I would be glad if he would at the same time send me a set, the case\r\nof which should be made as Dr. Franklin describes his to have been, so\r\nthat I may repeat his experiment. Colonel Smith will do me the favor to\r\nreceive these things from Mr. Nairne, and to pay him for them.\r\n\r\nI think Mr. Rittenhouse never published an invention of his in this way,\r\nwhich was a very good one. It was of an hygrometer which, like the common\r\nones, was to give the actual moisture of the air. He has two slips of\r\nmahogany about five inches long, three-fourths of an inch broad, and\r\none-tenth of an inch thick, the one having the grain running lengthwise,\r\nand the other crosswise. These are glued together by their faces, so as\r\nto form a piece five inches long, three-fourths of an inch broad, and\r\none third of an inch thick, which is stuck by its lower end into a little\r\nplinth of wood, presenting their edge to the view. The fibres of the wood\r\nyou know are dilated, but not lengthened by moisture. The slip, therefore,\r\nwhose grain is lengthwise, becomes a standard, retaining always the same\r\nprecise length. That which has its grain crosswise, dilates with moisture,\r\nand contracts for the want of it. If the right hand piece be the cross\r\ngrained one, when the air is very moist, it lengthens, and forces its\r\ncompanion to form a kind of interior annulus of a circle on the left.\r\nWhen the air is dry, it contracts, draws its companion to the right, and\r\nbecomes itself the interior annulus. In order to show this dilatation\r\nand contraction, an index is fixed on the upper end of two of the slips;\r\na plate of metal or wood is fastened to the front of the plinth, so as\r\nto cover the two slips from the eye. A slit, being nearly the portion of\r\na circle, is cut in this plate, so that the shank of the index may play\r\nfreely through its whole range. On the edge of the slit is a graduation.\r\nThe objection to this instrument is, that it is not fit for comparative\r\nobservations, because no two pieces of wood being of the same texture\r\nexactly, no two will yield exactly alike to the same agent. However, it\r\nis less objectionable on this account, than most of the substances used.\r\nMr. Rittenhouse had a thought of trying ivory; but I do not know whether\r\nhe executed it. All these substances not only vary from one another at the\r\nsame time, but from themselves at different times. All of them, however,\r\nhave some peculiar advantages, and I think this, on the whole, appeared\r\npreferable to any other I had ever seen. Not knowing whether you had heard\r\nof this instrument, and supposing it would amuse you, I have taken the\r\nliberty of detailing it to you.\r\n\r\nI beg you to be assured of the sentiments of perfect esteem and respect\r\nwith which I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, December 31, 1786.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I had the honor of addressing you on the 12th of the last month;\r\nsince which, your favor of October the 12th has been received, enclosing\r\na copy of the resolution of Congress for recalling Mr. Lambe. My letter\r\nby Mr. Randall informed you that we had put an end to his powers, and\r\nrequired him to repair to Congress. I lately received a letter from him,\r\ndated Alicant, October the 10th, of which I have the honor to enclose\r\nyou a copy; by which, you will perceive that the circumstance of ill\r\nhealth, either true or false, is urged for his not obeying our call. I\r\nshall immediately forward the order of Congress. I am not without fear,\r\nthat some misapplication of the public money may enter into the causes\r\nof his declining to return. The moment that I saw a symptom of this in\r\nhis conduct, as it was a circumstance which did not admit the delay of\r\nconsulting Mr. Adams, I wrote to Mr. Carmichael, to stop any moneys which\r\nhe might have in the hands of his banker. I am still unable to judge\r\nwhether he is guilty of this or not, as by the arrangements with Mr.\r\nAdams, who alone had done business with the bankers of the United States,\r\nin Holland, Mr. Lambe's drafts were to be made on him, and I know not\r\nwhat their amount has been. His drafts could not have been negotiated,\r\nif made on us both, at places so distant. Perhaps it may be thought, that\r\nthe appointment of Mr. Lambe was censurable in the moment in which it was\r\nmade. It is a piece of justice, therefore, which I owe to Mr. Adams, to\r\ndeclare that the proposition went first from me to him. I take the liberty\r\nof enclosing you a copy of my letter to Mr. Adams, of September the\r\n24th, 1785, in which that proposition was made. It expresses the motives\r\noperating on my mind in that moment, as well as the cautions I thought it\r\nnecessary to take. To these must be added, the difficulty of finding an\r\nAmerican in Europe fit for the business, and willing to undertake it. I\r\nknew afterwards, that Dr. Bancroft (who is named in the letter) could not,\r\non account of his own affairs, have accepted even a primary appointment. I\r\nthink it evident, that no appointment could have succeeded without a much\r\ngreater sum of money.\r\n\r\nI am happy to find that Mr. Barclay's mission has been attended with\r\ncomplete success. For this we are indebted, unquestionably, to the\r\ninfluence and good offices of the court of Madrid. Colonel Franks, the\r\nbearer of this, will have the honor to put into your hands the original of\r\nthe treaty, with other papers accompanying it. It will appear by these,\r\nthat Mr. Barclay has conducted himself with a degree of intelligence and\r\nof good faith, which reflects the highest honor on him.\r\n\r\nA copy of a letter from Captain O'Bryan to Mr. Carmichael, is also\r\nherewith enclosed. The information it contains will throw farther light\r\non the affairs of Algiers. His observations on the difficulties which\r\narise from the distance of Mr. Adams and myself from that place, and\r\nfrom one another, and the delays occasioned by this circumstance, are\r\ncertainly just. If Congress should propose to revive the negotiations,\r\nthey will judge whether it will not be more expedient to send a person to\r\nAlgiers, who can be trusted with full powers; and also whether a mission\r\nto Constantinople may not be previously necessary. Before I quit this\r\nsubject, I must correct an error in the letter of Captain O'Bryan. Mr.\r\nLambe was not limited, as he says, to one hundred, but to two hundred\r\ndollars apiece for our prisoners. This was the price which has been just\r\npaid for a large number of French prisoners, and this was our guide.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL OSGOOD.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, January 5, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am desired to forward to you the enclosed queries, and to ask\r\nthe favor of you to give such an answer to them, as may not give you too\r\nmuch trouble. Those which stand foremost on the paper, can be addressed\r\nonly to your complaisance; but the last may possibly be interesting to\r\nyour department, and to the United States. I mean those which suggest the\r\npossibility of borrowing money in Europe, the principal of which shall\r\nbe ultimately payable in land, and in the meantime a good interest. You\r\nknow best whether the suggestion can be turned to any profit, and whether\r\nit will be worth while to introduce any proposition to Congress thereon.\r\nAmong the possible shapes into which a matter of this kind may be formed,\r\nthe following is one: Let us suppose the public lands to be worth a\r\ndollar, hard money, the acre. If we should ask of a moneyed man a loan of\r\none hundred dollars, payable with one hundred acres of land at the end of\r\nten years, and in the meantime carrying an interest of five per cent.,\r\nthis would be more disadvantageous to the lender than a common loan,\r\npayable ultimately in cash. But if we should say, we will deliver you\r\nthe one hundred acres of land immediately, which is in fact an immediate\r\npayment of the principal, and will nevertheless pay your interest of five\r\nper cent., for ten years, this offers a superior advantage, and might\r\ntempt money holders. But what should we in fact receive, in this way,\r\nfor our lands? Thirty-seven dollars and one-fourth, being left in Europe,\r\non an interest of five per cent., would pay annually the interest of the\r\none hundred dollars for ten years. There would remain then only sixty-two\r\ndollars and three-quarters, for the one hundred acres of land, that is to\r\nsay, about two thirds of its price. Congress can best determine, whether\r\nany circumstance in our situation, should induce us to get rid of any of\r\nour debts in that way. I beg you to understand, that I have named rates\r\nof interest, term of payment, and price of land, merely to state the\r\ncase, and without the least knowledge that a loan could be obtained on\r\nthese terms. It remains to inform you from whom this suggestion comes.\r\nThe person from whom I receive it, is a Monsieur Claviere, connected\r\nwith the moneyed men of Amsterdam. He is, on behalf of a company there,\r\nactually treating with the Comptroller General here, for the purchase of\r\nour debt to this country, at a considerable discount. Whether he has an\r\nidea of offering a loan to us, on terms such as I have above spoken of,\r\nI know not; nor do I know that he is authorized to make the suggestion he\r\nhas made. If the thing should be deemed worthy the attention of Congress,\r\nthey can only consider it as a possibility, and take measures to avail\r\nthemselves of it, if the possibility turns out in their favor, and not to\r\nbe disappointed if it does not. Claviere's proposition not being formal\r\nenough for me to make an official communication of it, you will make what\r\nuse of it you see best. I am, with very sincere esteem and attachment,\r\ndear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE CALONNES.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, January 7, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I had the honor, on the 2d of November last, to acknowledge the\r\nreceipt of your Excellency's letter of October the 22d, wherein you are\r\nso good as to communicate to me the arrangements which the King had been\r\npleased to make for the encouragement of the commerce of the United States\r\nof America with his subjects. I immediately made known the same to the\r\nagents of the United States in the several seaports of this kingdom,\r\nthat they might give information thereof to the persons concerned in\r\nthat commerce. Unacquainted with the forms in which his Majesty usually\r\ndeclares his will in cases of this kind, and the manner in which it\r\nis communicated to the officers of the customs at the seaports, I am\r\nunable to answer those agents who inform me that the officers of the\r\ncustoms and farms do not as yet consider themselves bound to conform\r\nto the new regulations. I take the liberty, therefore, of soliciting\r\nyour Excellency's interposition for the issuing such orders as may be\r\nnecessary for carrying into effect the gracious intentions of the King,\r\nand of repeating the assurances of those sentiments of perfect respect and\r\nesteem, with which I have the honor to be your Excellency's most obedient,\r\nand most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, January 9, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--My last of December the 31st, acknowledged the receipt of yours of\r\nOctober the 12th, as the present does those of October the 3d, 9th, and\r\n27th, together with the resolution of Congress of October the 16th, on the\r\nclaim of Shweighauser. I will proceed in this business on the return of\r\nMr. Barclay, who, being fully acquainted with all the circumstances, will\r\nbe enabled to give me that information, the want of which might lead me to\r\ndo wrong on the one side or the other.\r\n\r\nInformation of the signature of the treaty with Morocco has been long on\r\nits passage to you. I will beg leave to recur to dates, that you may see\r\nthat no part of it has been derived from me. The first notice I had of\r\nit, was in a letter from Mr. Barclay, dated Daralbeyda, August the 11th.\r\nI received this on the 13th of September. No secure conveyance offered\r\ntill the 26th of the same month, being thirteen days after my receipt of\r\nit. In my letter of that date, which went by the way of London, I had the\r\nhonor to enclose you a copy of Mr. Barclay's letter. The conveyance of the\r\ntreaty itself is suffering a delay here at present, which all my anxiety\r\ncannot prevent. Colonel Franks' baggage, which came by water from Cadiz to\r\nRouen, has been long and hourly expected. The moment it arrives, he will\r\nset out to London, to have duplicates of the treaty signed by Mr. Adams,\r\nand from thence he will proceed to New York.\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier del Pinto, who treated with us on behalf of Portugal, being\r\nresident at London, I have presumed that causes of the delay of that\r\ntreaty had been made known to Mr. Adams, and by him communicated to you. I\r\nwill write to him by Colonel Franks, in order that you may be answered on\r\nthat subject.\r\n\r\nThe publication of the enclosed extract from my letter of May the 27th,\r\n1786, will, I fear, have very mischievous effects. It will tend to\r\ndraw on the Count de Vergennes the formidable phalanx of the Farms; to\r\nprevent his committing himself to me in any conversation which he does\r\nnot mean for the public papers; to inspire the same diffidence into all\r\nother ministers, with whom I might have to transact business; to defeat\r\nthe little hope, if any hope existed, of getting rid of the Farm on the\r\narticle of tobacco; and to damp that freedom of communication which the\r\nresolution of Congress of May the 3d, 1784, was intended to re-establish.\r\n\r\nObserving by the proceedings of Congress, that they are about to establish\r\na coinage, I think it my duty to inform them, that a Swiss, of the name of\r\nDrost, established here, has invented a method of striking the two faces\r\nand the edge of a coin, at one stroke. By this, and other simplifications\r\nof the process of coinage, he is enabled to coin from twenty-five thousand\r\nto thirty thousand pieces a day, with the assistance of only two persons,\r\nthe pieces of metal being first prepared. I send you by Colonel Franks\r\nthree coins of gold, silver and copper, which you will perceive to be\r\nperfect medals; and I can assure you, from having seen him coin many,\r\nthat every piece is as perfect as these. There has certainly never yet\r\nbeen seen any coin, in any country, comparable to this. The best workmen\r\nin this way, acknowledge that his is like a new art. Coin should always\r\nbe made in the highest perfection possible, because it is a great guard\r\nagainst the danger of false coinage. This man would be willing to furnish\r\nhis implements to Congress, and if they please, he will go over and\r\ninstruct a person to carry on the work: nor do I believe he would ask\r\nanything unreasonable. It would be very desirable, that in the institution\r\nof a new coinage, we could set out on so perfect a plan as this, and the\r\nmore so, as while the work is so exquisitely done, it is done cheaper.\r\n\r\nI will certainly do the best I can for the reformation of the consular\r\nconvention, being persuaded that our States would be very unwilling to\r\nconform their laws either to the convention, or to the scheme. But it\r\nis too difficult and too delicate, to form sanguine hopes. However, that\r\nthere may be room to reduce the convention, as much as circumstances will\r\nadmit, will it not be expedient for Congress to give me powers, in which\r\nthere shall be no reference to the scheme? The powers sent me, oblige me\r\nto produce that scheme, and certainly, the moment it is produced, they\r\nwill not abate a tittle from it. If they recollect the scheme, and insist\r\non it, we can but conclude it; but if they have forgotten it (which may\r\nbe), and are willing to reconsider the whole subject, perhaps we may get\r\nrid of something the more of it. As the delay is not injurious to us,\r\nbecause the convention, whenever and however made, is to put us in a worse\r\nstate than we are in now, I shall venture to defer saying a word on the\r\nsubject, till I can hear from you in answer to this. The full powers may\r\nbe sufficiently guarded, by private instructions to me, not to go beyond\r\nthe former scheme. This delay may be well enough ascribed (whenever I\r\nshall have received new powers) to a journey I had before apprised the\r\nminister that I should be obliged to take, to some mineral waters in the\r\nsouth of France, to see if, by their aid, I may recover the use of my\r\nright hand, of which a dislocation, about four months ago, threatens to\r\ndeprive me in a great measure. The surgeons have long insisted on this\r\nmeasure. I shall return by Bourdeaux, Nantes and L'Orient, to get the\r\nnecessary information for finishing our commercial regulations here.\r\nPermit me, however, to ask as immediately as possible, an answer, either\r\naffirmative or negative, as Congress shall think best, and to ascribe the\r\ndelay on which I venture, to my desire to do what is for the best.\r\n\r\nI send you a copy of the late marine regulations of this country. There\r\nare things in it, which may become interesting to us. Particularly,\r\nwhat relates to the establishment of a marine militia, and their\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\nYou will have seen in the public papers, that the King has called an\r\nassembly of the Notables of this country. This has not been done for one\r\nhundred and sixty years past. Of course, it calls up all the attention\r\nof the people. The objects of this assembly are not named: several are\r\nconjectured. The tolerating the Protestant religion; removing all the\r\ninternal Custom houses to the frontier; equalizing the gabelles on salt\r\nthrough the kingdom; the sale of the King's domains, to raise money; or,\r\nfinally, the effecting this necessary end by some other means, are talked\r\nof. But in truth, nothing is known about it. This government practises\r\nsecrecy so systematically, that it never publishes its purposes or its\r\nproceedings, sooner or more extensively than necessary. I send you a\r\npamphlet, which, giving an account of the last Assemblée des Notables, may\r\ngive an idea of what the present will be.\r\n\r\nA great desire prevails here of encouraging manufactures. The famous\r\nBoulton and Watts, who are at the head of the plated manufactures\r\nof Birmingham, the steam mills of London, copying presses and other\r\nmechanical works, have been here. It is said also, that Wedgewood has\r\nbeen here, who is famous for his steel manufactories, and an earthen\r\nware in the antique style; but as to this last person, I am not certain.\r\nIt cannot, I believe, be doubted, but that they came at the request\r\nof government, and that they will be induced to establish similar\r\nmanufactures here.\r\n\r\nThe transferring hither those manufactures, which contribute so much to\r\ndraw our commerce to England, will have a great tendency to strengthen our\r\nconnections with this country, and loosen them with that.\r\n\r\nThe enfranchising the port of Honfleur at the mouth of the Seine, for\r\nmultiplying the connections with us, is at present an object. It meets\r\nwith opposition in the ministry; but I am in hopes it will prevail.\r\nIf natural causes operate, uninfluenced by accidental circumstances,\r\nBourdeaux and Honfleur, or Havre, must ultimately take the greatest part\r\nof our commerce. The former by the Garonne and canal of Languedoc, opens\r\nthe southern provinces to us; the latter, the northern ones and Paris.\r\nHonfleur will be peculiarly advantageous for our rice and whale oil,\r\nof which the principal consumption is at Paris. Being free, they can be\r\nre-exported when the market here shall happen to be overstocked.\r\n\r\nThe labors of the ensuing summer will close the eastern half of the harbor\r\nof Cherbourg, which will contain and protect forty sail of the line. It\r\nhas from fifty to thirty-five feet of water next to the cones, shallowing\r\ngradually to the shore. Between this and Dunkirk, the navigation of the\r\nchannel will be rendered much safer in the event of a war with England,\r\nand invasions on that country become more practicable.\r\n\r\nThe gazettes of France and Leyden, to the present date, accompany this.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect respect, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, January 11, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Mr. Jay, in his last letter to me, observes they hear nothing\r\nfurther of the treaty with Portugal. I have taken the liberty of telling\r\nhim that I will write to you on the subject, and that he may expect to\r\nhear from you on it, by the present conveyance. The Chevalier del Pinto\r\nbeing at London, I presume he has, or can inform you why it is delayed on\r\ntheir part. I will thank you also for the information he shall give you.\r\n\r\nThere is here an order of priests called the Mathurins, the object of\r\nwhose institution is, the begging of alms for the redemption of captives.\r\nAbout eighteen months ago, they redeemed three hundred, which cost them\r\nabout fifteen hundred livres a piece. They have agents residing in the\r\nBarbary States, who are constantly employed in searching and contracting\r\nfor the captives of their nation, and they redeem at a lower price than\r\nany other people can. It occurred to me, that their agency might be\r\nengaged for our prisoners at Algiers. I have had interviews with them,\r\nand the last night, a long one with the General of the order. They offer\r\ntheir services with all the benignity and cordiality possible. The General\r\ntold me, he could not expect to redeem our prisoners as cheap as their\r\nown, but that he would use all the means in his power to do it on the\r\nbest terms possible, which will be the better, as there shall be the less\r\nsuspicion that he acts for our public. I told him I would write to you\r\non the subject, and speak to him again. What do you think of employing\r\nthem, limiting them to a certain price, as three hundred dollars for\r\ninstance, or any other sum you think proper? He will write immediately to\r\nhis instruments there, and in two or three months we can know the event.\r\nHe will deliver them at Marseilles, Cadiz, or where we please, at our\r\nexpense. The money remaining of the fund destined to the Barbary business,\r\nmay, I suppose, be drawn on for this object. Write me your opinion,\r\nif you please, on this subject, finally, fully and immediately, that,\r\nif you approve the proposition, I may enter into arrangements with the\r\nGeneral, before my departure to the waters of Aix, which will be about the\r\nbeginning of February.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with very sincere esteem and respect, dear Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL FRANKS.\r\n\r\n                                                          January 11, 1787.\r\n\r\nMy anxiety, my dear Sir, on the detention of the Morocco treaty is\r\ninexpressible. However cogent and necessary the motives which detain you,\r\nI should be deemed inexcusable were I to let such a safe opportunity as\r\nthat by Colonel Blackden pass without sending the papers on to London. Mr.\r\nJay complained that a treaty signed in June was not ratified in October.\r\nWhat will they say when they shall observe that the same treaty does not\r\nreach them till March, nine months? In the meantime, our whole commerce\r\nis paying a heavy tax for insurance till its publication. Can you fix\r\na day as early as Monday or Tuesday for your departure, whether your\r\nbaggage arrives or not? or would you rather decline the going with the\r\npapers? In the former case, if your baggage does not arrive before your\r\ndeparture, any orders you may think proper to leave respecting it, shall\r\nbe punctually executed. I can send it to Mr. Simonson at Havre, so that it\r\nmay go to America in the February packet. I shall see you at the Marquis's\r\nto-day, and we will speak about this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR OTTO.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, January 14, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have been honored with your letter of October 15, and thank you\r\nfor the intelligence it contained. I am able to make you but an unequal\r\nreturn for it, your friends here being so much more in condition to\r\ncommunicate to you interesting intelligence. With respect to the affairs\r\nof Holland, they do not promise arrangement. The interest which the King\r\nof Prussia takes in the affairs of the Stadtholder, seem to threaten an\r\ninterruption of his cordiality with the country. The misunderstanding\r\nbetween the Kings of Spain and Naples, and a projected visit of the latter\r\nto Vienna, with the known influence of his Queen over him, are matter for\r\nsome jealousy.\r\n\r\nAs to domestic news, the Assembly des Notables occupies all conversation.\r\nWhat will be the subjects of their deliberation is not yet declared.\r\nThe establishment of provincial assemblies, tolerating the Protestant\r\nreligion, removing the internal barriers to the frontiers, equalizing the\r\nGabelles, sale of the King's domains, and, in short, every other possible\r\nreformation, are conjectured by different persons. I send you a pamphlet\r\non the last Assembly of Notables, from which ideas are formed as to what\r\nthis will be. Possibly you may receive the same from some of your friends.\r\nI send you, also, what it is less likely you should get from them, because\r\nit is next to impossible to get it at all--that is, a late memoire by\r\nLinquet, which has produced his perpetual exile from this country.\r\nTo these I add a report written by M. Bailly, on the subject of the\r\nHotel-Dieu of Paris, which has met a very general approbation. These are\r\nthings for the day only. I recollect no work of any dignity which has been\r\nlately published. We shall very soon receive another volume on Mineralogy\r\nfrom M. de Buffon; and a third volume of the Cultivator Americaine is in\r\nthe press. So is a History of the American War, by a Monsieur Soulés, the\r\ntwo first volumes of which, coming down to the capture of Burgoyne, I have\r\nseen, and think better than any I have seen. Mazzei will print soon two or\r\nthree volumes 8vo, of Recherches Historiques and Politiques sur les Etats\r\nUnis d'Amerique, which are sensible. We are flattered with the hopes that\r\nthe packet boats will hereafter sail monthly from Havre, the first being\r\nto sail on the 10th of the next month. This is very desirable indeed, as\r\nit will furnish more frequent opportunities of correspondence between the\r\ntwo countries. If I can be made useful to you in any line whatever here,\r\nit will make me very happy. Being with sincere esteem and respect, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR LE DUC D'HARCOURT, GOVERNEUR DU DAUPHIN.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, January 14, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In the conversation with which you were pleased to honor me, a few\r\ndays ago, on the enfranchisement of the port of Honfleur, I took the\r\nliberty of observing, that I was not instructed by my constituents to\r\nmake any proposition on that subject. That it would be agreeable to them,\r\nhowever, I must suppose, because it will offer the following advantages:\r\n\r\n1. It is a convenient entrepôt for furnishing us with the manufactures of\r\nthe northern parts of France, and particularly of Paris, and for receiving\r\nand distributing the productions of our country in exchange.\r\n\r\n2. Cowes, on the opposite side of the channel, has heretofore been the\r\ndeposit for a considerable part of our productions, landed in Great\r\nBritain in the first instance, but intended for re-exportation. From\r\nthence, our rice, particularly, has been distributed to France and other\r\nparts of Europe. I am not certain whether our tobaccos were deposited\r\nthere, or carried to London to be sorted for the different markets.\r\nTo draw this business from Cowes, no place is so favorably situated as\r\nHonfleur.\r\n\r\n3. It would be a convenient deposit for our whale oil, of which, after the\r\nsupply of Paris, there will be a surplus for re-exportation.\r\n\r\n4. Should our fur trade be recovered out of the hands of the English, it\r\nwill naturally come to Honfleur, as the port of Paris.\r\n\r\n5. Salt is an important article in all our return cargoes; because, being\r\ncarried as ballast, its freight costs nothing. But, on account of some\r\nregulations, with which I am not well acquainted, it cannot, at present,\r\nbe shipped to advantage from any port on the Seine.\r\n\r\n6. Our vessels being built sharp, for swift sailing, suffer extremely in\r\nmost of the western ports of France, in which they are left on dry ground\r\nat every ebb of the tide. But at Honfleur, I am told, they can ride in\r\nbold water, on a good bottom and near the shore at all times.\r\n\r\nThese facts may, perhaps, throw some light on the question in which,\r\nfor the good of both countries, you are pleased to interest yourself.\r\nI take the liberty, therefore, of barely mentioning them, and with the\r\nmore pleasure, as it furnishes me an occasion of assuring you of those\r\nsentiments of respect and esteem with which I have the honor to be, your\r\nmost obedient, humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR DE CREVE-COEUR.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, January 15, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I see by the Journal of this morning, that they are robbing\r\nus of another of our inventions to give it to the English. The writer,\r\nindeed, only admits them to have revived what he thinks was known to the\r\nGreeks, that is, the making the circumference of a wheel of one single\r\npiece. The farmers in New Jersey were the first who practised it, and\r\nthey practised it commonly. Dr. Franklin, in one of his trips to London,\r\nmentioned this practice to the man now in London, who has the patent\r\nfor making those wheels. The idea struck him. The Doctor promised to go\r\nto his shop, and assist him in trying to make the wheel of one piece.\r\nThe Jersey farmers do it by cutting a young sapling, and bending it,\r\nwhile green and juicy, into a circle; and leaving it so until it becomes\r\nperfectly seasoned. But in London there are no saplings. The difficulty\r\nwas, then, to give to old wood the pliancy of young. The Doctor and the\r\nworkman labored together some weeks, and succeeded; and the man obtained\r\na patent for it, which has made his fortune. I was in his shop in London,\r\nhe told me the whole story himself, and acknowledged, not only the origin\r\nof the idea, but how much the assistance of Dr. Franklin had contributed\r\nto perform the operation on dry wood. He spoke of him with love and\r\ngratitude. I think I have had a similar account from Dr. Franklin, but\r\ncannot be quite certain. I know, that being in Philadelphia when the\r\nfirst set of patent wheels arrived from London, and were spoken of by the\r\ngentleman (an Englishman) who brought them, as a wonderful discovery, the\r\nidea of its being a new discovery was laughed at by the Philadelphians,\r\nwho, in their Sunday parties across the Delaware, had seen every farmer's\r\ncart mounted on such wheels. The writer in the paper, supposes the English\r\nworkman got his idea from Homer. But it is more likely the Jersey farmer\r\ngot his idea from thence, because ours are the only farmers who can read\r\nHomer; because, too, the Jersey practice is precisely that stated by\r\nHomer: the English practice very different. Homer's words are (comparing a\r\nyoung hero killed by Ajax to a poplar felled by a workman) literally thus:\r\n\"He fell on the ground, like a poplar, which has grown smooth, in the west\r\npart of a great meadow; with its branches shooting from its summit. But\r\nthe chariot maker, with the sharp axe, has felled it, that he may bend a\r\nwheel for a beautiful chariot. It lies drying on the banks of the river.\"\r\nObserve the circumstances which coincide with the Jersey practice. 1. It\r\nis a tree growing in a moist place, full of juices and easily bent. 2. It\r\nis cut while green. 3. It is bent into the circumference of a wheel. 4.\r\nIt is left to dry in that form. You, who write French well and readily,\r\nshould write a line for the Journal, to reclaim the honor of our farmers.\r\nAdieu. Yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL EDWARD CARRINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, January 16, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Uncertain whether you might be at New York at the moment of\r\nColonel Franks' arrival, I have enclosed my private letters for Virginia\r\nunder cover to our delegation in general, which otherwise I would have\r\ntaken the liberty to enclose particularly to you, as best acquainted with\r\nthe situation of the persons to whom they are addressed. Should this find\r\nyou at New York, I will still ask your attention to them.\r\n\r\nIn my letter to Mr. Jay, I have mentioned the meeting of the Notables,\r\nappointed for the 29th instant. It is now put off to the 7th or 8th of\r\nnext month. This event, which will hardly excite any attention in America,\r\nis deemed here the most important one which has taken place in their civil\r\nline during the present century. Some promise their country great things\r\nfrom it, some nothing. Our friend de La Fayette was placed on the list\r\noriginally. Afterwards his name disappeared, but finally was reinstated.\r\nThis shows that his character here is not considered as an indifferent\r\none, and that it excites agitation. His education in our school has drawn\r\non him a very jealous eye from a court whose principles are the most\r\nabsolute despotism. But I hope he has nearly passed his crisis. The King,\r\nwho is a good man, is favorably disposed towards him, and he is supported\r\nby powerful family connections and by the public good will. He is the\r\nyoungest man of the Notables except one whose office placed him on the\r\nlist.\r\n\r\nThe Count de Vergennes has within these ten days had a very severe attack\r\nof what is deemed an unfixed gout. He has been well enough, however, to do\r\nbusiness to-day. But anxieties for him are not yet quieted. He is a great\r\nand good minister, and an accident to him might endanger the peace of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe tumults in America I expected would have produced in Europe an\r\nunfavorable opinion of our political state. But it has not. On the\r\ncontrary, the small effect of these tumults seems to have given more\r\nconfidence in the firmness of our governments. The interposition of the\r\npeople themselves on the side of government has had a great effect on the\r\nopinion here. I am persuaded myself that the good sense of the people\r\nwill always be found to be the best army. They may be led astray for a\r\nmoment, but will soon correct themselves. The people are the only censors\r\nof their governors; and even their errors will tend to keep these to the\r\ntrue principles of their institution. To punish these errors too severely\r\nwould be to suppress the only safeguard of the public liberty. The way to\r\nprevent these irregular interpositions of the people, is to give them full\r\ninformation of their affairs through the channel of the public papers,\r\nand to contrive that those papers should penetrate the whole mass of the\r\npeople. The basis of our governments being the opinion of the people,\r\nthe very first object should be to keep that right; and were it left to\r\nme to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or\r\nnewspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer\r\nthe latter. But I should mean that every man should receive those papers,\r\nand be capable of reading them. I am convinced that those societies (as\r\nthe Indians) which live without government, enjoy in their general mass\r\nan infinitely greater degree of happiness than those who live under the\r\nEuropean governments. Among the former, public opinion is in the place of\r\nlaw, and restrains morals as powerfully as laws ever did anywhere. Among\r\nthe latter, under pretence of governing, they have divided their nations\r\ninto two classes, wolves and sheep. I do not exaggerate. This is a true\r\npicture of Europe. Cherish, therefore, the spirit of our people, and keep\r\nalive their attention. Do not be too severe upon their errors, but reclaim\r\nthem by enlightening them. If once they become inattentive to the public\r\naffairs, you and I, and Congress and Assemblies, Judges and Governors,\r\nshall all become wolves. It seems to be the law of our general nature, in\r\nspite of individual exceptions; and experience declares that man is the\r\nonly animal which devours his own kind; for I can apply no milder term\r\nto the governments of Europe, and to the general prey of the rich on the\r\npoor. The want of news has led me into disquisition instead of narration,\r\nforgetting you have every day enough of that. I shall be happy to hear\r\nfrom you sometimes, only observing that whatever passes through the post\r\nis read, and that when you write what should be read by myself only, you\r\nmust be so good as to confide your letter to some passenger, or officer of\r\nthe packet. I will ask your permission to write to you sometimes, and to\r\nassure you of the esteem and respect with which I have honor to be, dear\r\nSir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DU RIVAL.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, January 17, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--You were pleased, in behalf of a friend, to ask information of me\r\non the subject of the money of the United States of America, and I had\r\nthe honor of informing you, by letter of November 7, that no regulations\r\nof their coin had then been made by Congress, as far as I knew. They\r\nhad, however, entered into resolutions on that subject, which have since\r\ncome to hand. A translation of these will be found in the Leyden Gazette\r\nof some few weeks ago. But it will be necessary to make the following\r\ncorrections in the Gazette:\r\n\r\nThe Gazette dates the resolutions October 10; but they were of August 8.\r\nIt gives only 365.64 grains of pure silver to the dollar; it should be\r\n375.64. It states the pound of silver, with its alloy, to be worth 9.99\r\ndollars only, whereas it is fixed at 13.777 dollars; and the pound of\r\ngold, with its alloy, being worth 209.77 dollars, gives the proportion\r\nof silver to gold as 1 to 15.225. These corrections being made, the\r\nresolutions as stated in the Leyden Gazette may be confided in.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with much respect, Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. S. AND J. H. DELAP.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, January 17, 1787.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--I am honored this day by the receipt of your letter of the\r\n6th instant. Having nothing to do with the matters of account of the\r\nUnited States in Europe, it is out of my power to say anything to you as\r\nto the payment of the balance due to you. Yet I think it would be proper\r\nfor you to write to the \"Commissioners of the Treasury,\" at New York, on\r\nthis subject. They are the persons who are to pay it; and as their Board\r\nhas been created since the debt was contracted, they may possibly need\r\ninformation on the subject.\r\n\r\nAs to your loan office certificates, you would do well to commit them\r\nto some correspondent in America. They will be settled by the table\r\nof depreciation at their true worth in gold or silver at the time the\r\npaper dollars were lent. On that true value the interest has been paid,\r\nand continues to be paid to the creditors annually in America. That the\r\nprincipal will also be paid, is as sure as any future fact can be. The\r\nepoch is not fixed. It is expected that the State of New York will shortly\r\naccede to the impost which has been proposed. When that shall be done,\r\nthat impost will suffice to pay the interest, and sink the principal in a\r\nvery few years. I have the honor to be, with much respect. Gentlemen, your\r\nmost obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. SOULÉS.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, January 19, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have the honor of enclosing to you the sheets on the subject of\r\nWyoming. I have had a long conversation with M. Creve-coeur on them. He\r\nknows well that canton. He was in the neighborhood of the place when it\r\nwas destroyed, saw great numbers of the fugitives, aided them with his\r\nwagons, and had the story from all their mouths. He committed notes to\r\nwriting at the moment, which are now in Normandy, at his father's. He\r\nhas written for them, and they will be here in five or six days, when he\r\npromises to put them into my hands. He says there will be a great deal to\r\nalter in your narration, and that it must assume a different face, more\r\nfavorable both to the British and Indians. His veracity may be relied on,\r\nand I told him I was sure your object was truth; and, to render your work\r\nestimable by that character, that I thought you would wait, and readily\r\nmake any changes upon evidence which should be satisfactory to you. The\r\nmoment I receive his notes I will communicate them to you, and have the\r\nhonor to be, with much respect, Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. HILLIARD D'AUBERTEUIL.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, January 27, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I duly received the letter you did me the honor to write, and the\r\nverses therein enclosed on the subject of M. de La Fayette. I have taken\r\nmeasures to present the public with this acceptable present; but the\r\nnewspapers here are slow in complying with the applications addressed\r\nto them. It is not for a stranger to decide on the merits of poetry in a\r\nlanguage foreign to him. Were I to presume to do it in this instance, I\r\nshould certainly assign to this composition a high degree of approbation.\r\n\r\nI wish it were in my power to furnish you with any materials for the\r\nhistory on which you are engaged, but I brought no papers of that kind\r\nwith me from America. In a letter you did me the honor of writing me\r\nsometime ago, you seemed to suppose you might go to America in quest of\r\nmaterials. Should you execute this idea, I should with great pleasure\r\ngive any assistance in my power to obtain access for you to the several\r\ndeposits of materials which are in that country. I have the honor to be,\r\nwith great respect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHEVALIER DE SEGOND.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, January 27, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received the letter with which you have been pleased\r\nto honor me, complaining of the non-payment of interest on the sum due\r\nto you from the United States. I feel with great sensibility the weight\r\nof these complaints; but it is neither in my province, nor in my power,\r\nto remedy them. I am noways authorized to interfere with the money\r\nmatters of the United States in Europe. These rest altogether between\r\nthe Commissioners of the Treasury of the United States at New York and\r\ntheir bankers in Europe. Being informed, however, from Mr. Grand, that the\r\nfunds appropriated to the payment of the foreign officers were exhausted,\r\nI took the liberty of representing strongly to the Commissioners the\r\nmotives which should urge them to furnish new supplies. They assured me,\r\nin answer, that they would do it at the first moment it should be in their\r\npower. I am perfectly persuaded they will; however, I shall immediately\r\nforward to them the letter you have been pleased to address to me; and\r\nwill observe to you, that it is to them alone, or to Congress, to whom you\r\ncan make any future applications with effect.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with much respect, Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.[C]\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, January 30, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My last to you was of the 16th of December; since which, I have\r\nreceived yours of November the 25th, and December the 4th, which afforded\r\nme, as your letters always do, a treat on matters public, individual and\r\neconomical. I am impatient to learn your sentiments on the late troubles\r\nin the eastern States. So far as I have yet seen, they do not appear to\r\nthreaten serious consequences. Those States have suffered by the stoppage\r\nof the channels of their commerce, which have not yet found other issues.\r\nThis must render money scarce, and make the people uneasy. This uneasiness\r\nhas produced acts absolutely unjustifiable; but I hope they will provoke\r\nno severities from their governments. A consciousness of those in power\r\nthat their administration of the public affairs has been honest, may,\r\nperhaps, produce too great a degree of indignation; and those characters,\r\nwherein fear predominates over hope, may apprehend too much from these\r\ninstances of irregularity. They may conclude too hastily, that nature\r\nhas formed man insusceptible of any other government than that of force,\r\na conclusion not founded in truth nor experience. Societies exist under\r\nthree forms, sufficiently distinguishable. 1. Without government, as\r\namong our Indians. 2. Under governments, wherein the will of every one\r\nhas a just influence; as is the case in England, in a slight degree,\r\nand in our States, in a great one. 3. Under governments of force; as is\r\nthe case in all other monarchies, and in most of the other republics.\r\nTo have an idea of the curse of existence under these last, they must\r\nbe seen. It is a government of wolves over sheep. It is a problem, not\r\nclear in my mind, that the first condition is not the best. But I believe\r\nit to be inconsistent with any great degree of population. The second\r\nstate has a great deal of good in it. The mass of mankind under that,\r\nenjoys a precious degree of liberty and happiness. It has its evils,\r\ntoo; the principal of which is the turbulence to which it is subject. But\r\nweigh this against the oppressions of monarchy, and it becomes nothing.\r\n_Malo periculosam libertatem quam quietam servitutem._ Even this evil\r\nis productive of good. It prevents the degeneracy of government, and\r\nnourishes a general attention to the public affairs. I hold it, that\r\na little rebellion, now and then, is a good thing, and as necessary in\r\nthe political world as storms in the physical. Unsuccessful rebellions,\r\nindeed, generally establish the encroachments on the rights of the people,\r\nwhich have produced them. An observation of this truth should render\r\nhonest republican governors so mild in their punishment of rebellions, as\r\nnot to discourage them too much. It is a medicine necessary for the sound\r\nhealth of government.\r\n\r\nIf these transactions give me no uneasiness, I feel very differently at\r\nanother piece of intelligence, to wit, the possibility that the navigation\r\nof the Mississippi may be abandoned to Spain. I never had any interest\r\nwestward of the Alleghany; and I never will have any. But I have had\r\ngreat opportunities of knowing the character of the people who inhabit\r\nthat country; and I will venture to say, that the act which abandons the\r\nnavigation of the Mississippi is an act of separation between the eastern\r\nand western country. It is a relinquishment of five parts out of eight,\r\nof the territory of the United States; an abandonment of the fairest\r\nsubject for the payment of our public debts, and the chaining those debts\r\non our own necks, _in perpetuum_. I have the utmost confidence in the\r\nhonest intentions of those who concur in this measure; but I lament their\r\nwant of acquaintance with the character and physical advantages of the\r\npeople, who, right or wrong, will suppose their interests sacrificed on\r\nthis occasion, to the contrary interests of that part of the confederacy\r\nin possession of present power. If they declare themselves a separate\r\npeople, we are incapable of a single effort to retain them. Our citizens\r\ncan never be induced, either as militia or as soldiers, to go there to cut\r\nthe throats of their own brothers and sons, or rather, to be themselves\r\nthe subjects, instead of the perpetrators of the parricide. Nor would\r\nthat country quit the cost of being retained against the will of its\r\ninhabitants, could it be done. But it cannot be done. They are able\r\nalready to rescue the navigation of the Mississippi out of the hands of\r\nSpain, and to add New Orleans to their own territory. They will be joined\r\nby the inhabitants of Louisiana. This will bring on a war between them\r\nand Spain; and that will produce the question with us, whether it will\r\nnot be worth our while to become parties with them in the war, in order to\r\nre-unite them with us, and thus correct our error? And were I to permit my\r\nforebodings to go one step further, I should predict that the inhabitants\r\nof the United States would force their rulers to take the affirmative of\r\nthat question. I wish I may be mistaken in all these opinions.\r\n\r\nWe have, for some time, expected that the Chevalier de La Luzerne would\r\nobtain a promotion in the diplomatic line, by being appointed to some\r\nof the courts where this country keeps an ambassador. But none of the\r\nvacancies taking place, which had been counted on, I think the present\r\ndisposition is, to require his return to his station in America. He told\r\nme himself, lately, that he should return in the spring. I have never\r\npressed this matter on the court, though I knew it to be desirable and\r\ndesired on our part; because, if the compulsion on him to return had been\r\nthe work of Congress, he would have returned in such ill temper with them,\r\nas to disappoint them in the good they expected from it. He would forever\r\nhave laid at their door his failure of promotion. I did not press it for\r\nanother reason, which is, that I have great reason to believe that the\r\ncharacter of the Count de Moutier, who would go, were the Chevalier to\r\nbe otherwise provided for, would give the most perfect satisfaction in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nAs you have now returned into Congress, it will become of importance\r\nthat you should form a just estimate of certain public characters: on\r\nwhich, therefore, I will give you such notes, as my knowledge of them\r\nhas furnished me with. You will compare them with the materials you are\r\notherwise possessed of, and decide on a view of the whole.\r\n\r\nYou know the opinion I formerly entertained of my friend, Mr. Adams. * * *\r\nand the Governor were the first who shook that opinion. I afterwards saw\r\nproofs which convicted him of a degree of vanity, and of a blindness to\r\nit, of which no germ appeared in Congress. A seven months' intimacy with\r\nhim here, and as many weeks' in London, have given me opportunities of\r\nstudying him closely. He is vain, irritable, and a bad calculator of the\r\nforce and probable effect of the motives which govern men. This is all the\r\nill which can possibly be said of him. He is as disinterested as the being\r\nwho made him: he is profound in his views; and accurate in his judgment,\r\nexcept where knowledge of the world is necessary to form a judgment. He\r\nis so amiable, that I pronounce you will love him, if ever you become\r\nacquainted with him. He would be, as he was, a great man in Congress.\r\n\r\nMr. Carmichael, is, I think, very little known in America. I never saw\r\nhim, and while I was in Congress I formed rather a disadvantageous idea\r\nof him. His letters, received then, showed him vain, and more attentive to\r\nceremony and etiquette, than we suppose men of sense should be. I have now\r\na constant correspondence with him, and find him a little hypochondriac\r\nand discontented. He possesses a very good understanding, though not of\r\nthe first order. I have had great opportunities of searching into his\r\ncharacter, and have availed myself of them. Many persons of different\r\nnations, coming from Madrid to Paris, all speak of him as in high esteem,\r\nand I think it certain that he has more of the Count de Florida Blanca's\r\nfriendship, than any diplomatic character at that court. As long as this\r\nminister is in office, Carmichael can do more than any other person who\r\ncould be sent there.\r\n\r\nYou will see Franks, and doubtless he will be asking some appointment. I\r\nwish there may be any one for which he is fit. He is light, indiscreet,\r\nactive, honest, affectionate. Though Bingham is not in diplomatic office,\r\nyet as he wishes to be so, I will mention such circumstances of him, as\r\nyou might otherwise be deceived in. He will make you believe he was on the\r\nmost intimate footing with the first characters in Europe, and versed in\r\nthe secrets of every cabinet. Not a word of this is true. He had a rage\r\nfor being presented to great men, and had no * * * in the methods by which\r\nhe could effect it. * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de La Fayette is a most valuable auxiliary to me. His zeal\r\nis unbounded, and his weight with those in power, great. His education\r\nhaving been merely military, commerce was an unknown field to him. But his\r\ngood sense enabling him to comprehend perfectly whatever is explained to\r\nhim, his agency has been very efficacious. He has a great deal of sound\r\ngenius, is well remarked by the King, and rising in popularity. He has\r\nnothing against him, but the suspicion of republican principles. I think\r\nhe will one day be of the ministry. His foible is, a canine appetite for\r\npopularity and fame; but he will get above this. _The Count de Vergennes_\r\nis _ill_. The possibility of his _recovery_, renders it dangerous for us\r\nto express a doubt of it; but he is in danger. He is a great minister in\r\nEuropean affairs, but has very imperfect ideas of our _institutions_, and\r\nno confidence in them. His devotion to the principles of pure despotism,\r\nrenders him unaffectionate to our governments. But his fear of England\r\nmakes him value us as a make weight. He is cool, reserved in political\r\nconversations, but free and familiar on other subjects, and a very\r\nattentive, agreeable person to do business with. It is impossible to have\r\na clearer, better organized head; but age has chilled his heart.\r\n\r\nNothing should be spared, on our part, to attach this country to us.\r\nIt is the only one on which we can rely for support, under every event.\r\nIts inhabitants love us more, I think, than they do any other nation on\r\nearth. This is very much the effect of the good dispositions with which\r\nthe French officers returned. In a former letter, I mentioned to you the\r\ndislocation of my wrist. I can make not the least use of it, except for\r\nthe single article of writing, though it is going on five months since the\r\naccident happened. I have great anxieties, lest I should never recover\r\nany considerable use of it. I shall, by the advice of my surgeons, set\r\nout in a fortnight for the waters of Aix, in Provence. I chose these out\r\nof several they proposed to me, because if they fail to be effectual, my\r\njourney will not be useless altogether. It will give me an opportunity\r\nof examining the canal of Languedoc, and of acquiring knowledge of\r\nthat species of navigation, which may be useful hereafter; but more\r\nimmediately, it will enable me to make the tour of the ports concerned\r\nin commerce with us, to examine, on the spot, the defects of the late\r\nregulations respecting our commerce, to learn the further improvements\r\nwhich may be made in it, and on my return, to get this business finished.\r\nI shall be absent between two and three months, unless anything happens\r\nto recall me here sooner, which may always be effected in ten days, in\r\nwhatever part of my route I may be.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of characters, I omitted those of Reyneval and Hennin, the two\r\neyes of Count de Vergennes. The former is the most important character,\r\nbecause possessing the most of the confidence of the Count. He is rather\r\ncunning than wise, his views of things being neither great nor liberal.\r\nHe governs himself by principles which he has learned by rote, and is fit\r\nonly for the details of execution. His heart is susceptible of little\r\npassions, but not of good ones. He is brother-in-law to M. Gerard,\r\nfrom whom he received disadvantageous impressions of us, which cannot\r\nbe effaced. He has much duplicity. Hennin is a philosopher, sincere,\r\nfriendly, liberal, learned, beloved by everybody; the other by nobody. I\r\nthink it a great misfortune that the United States are in the department\r\nof the former. As particulars of this kind may be useful to you, in your\r\npresent situation, I may hereafter continue the chapter. I know it will be\r\nsafely lodged in your discretion.\r\n\r\nFeb. 5. Since writing thus far, Franks has returned from England. I\r\nlearn that Mr. Adams desires to be recalled, and that Smith should be\r\nappointed chargé des affaires there. It is not for me to decide whether\r\nany diplomatic character should be kept at a court, which keeps none with\r\nus. You can judge of Smith's abilities by his letters. They are not of\r\nthe first order, but they are good. For his honesty, he is like our friend\r\nMonroe; turn his soul wrong side outwards, and there is not a speck on it.\r\nHe has one foible, an excessive inflammability of temper, but he feels it\r\nwhen it comes on, and has resolution enough to suppress it, and to remain\r\nsilent till it passes over.\r\n\r\nI send you, by Colonel Franks, your pocket telescope, walking stick and\r\nchemical box. The two former could not be combined together. The latter\r\ncould not be had in the form you referred to. Having a great desire\r\nto have a portable copying machine, and being satisfied, from some\r\nexperiments, that the principle of the large machine might be applied in\r\na small one, I planned one when in England, and had it made. It answers\r\nperfectly. I have since set a workman to making them here, and they are\r\nin such demand that he has his hands full. Being assured that you will be\r\npleased to have one, when you shall have tried its convenience, I send you\r\none by Colonel Franks. The machine costs ninety-six livres, the appendages\r\ntwenty-four livres, and I send you paper and ink for twelve livres;\r\nin all, one hundred and thirty-two livres. There is a printed paper of\r\ndirections; but you must expect to make many essays before you succeed\r\nperfectly. A soft brush, like a shaving brush, is more convenient than\r\nthe sponge. You can get as much ink and paper as you please from London.\r\nThe paper costs a guinea a ream. I am, dear Sir, with sincere esteem and\r\naffection, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n    [C] [The latter part of this letter is in cypher; but appended to\r\n    the copy preserved, are explanatory notes, which have enabled us\r\n    to publish it entire, except a few words, to which they afford no\r\n    key. These are either marked thus * * *, or the words which the\r\n    context seemed to require, inserted in italics.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, February 1, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--My last letters were of the 31st of December, and 9th of January;\r\nsince which last date, I have been honored with yours of December the 13th\r\nand 14th. I shall pay immediate attention to your instructions relative\r\nto the South Carolina frigate. I had the honor of informing you of an\r\nimprovement in the art of coining, made here by one Drost, and of sending\r\nyou, by Colonel Franks, a specimen of his execution in gold and silver. I\r\nexpected to have sent also a coin of copper. The enclosed note from Drost\r\nwill explain the reason why this was not sent. It will let you see also,\r\nthat he may be employed; as I suppose he is not so certain as he was of\r\nbeing engaged here. Mr. Grand, who knows him, gives me reason to believe\r\nhe may be engaged reasonably. Congress will decide whether it be worth\r\ntheir attention.\r\n\r\nIn some of my former letters, I suggested an opportunity of obliging this\r\ncourt, by borrowing as much money in Holland as would pay the debt due\r\nhere, if such a loan could be obtained; as to which, I was altogether\r\nignorant. To save time, I wrote to Mr. Dumas, to know whether he thought\r\nit probable a loan could be obtained, enjoining on him the strictest\r\nsecrecy, and informing him I was making the inquiry merely of my own\r\nmotion, and without instruction. I enclose you his answer. He thinks\r\npurchasers of the debt could be found, with a sacrifice of a small part\r\nof the capital, and a postponement be obtained of some of the first\r\nreimbursements. The proposition by him, for an immediate adoption of this\r\nmeasure by me, was probably urged on his mind by a desire to serve our\r\ncountry, more than a strict attention to my duty, and the magnitude of\r\nthe object. I hope, on the contrary, that if it should be thought worth\r\na trial, it may be put into the hands of Mr. Adams, who knows the ground,\r\nand is known there, and whose former successful negotiations in this line,\r\nwould give better-founded hopes of success on this occasion.\r\n\r\nI formerly mentioned to you the hopes of preferment, entertained by the\r\nChevalier de La Luzerne. They have been baffled by events; none of the\r\nvacancies taking place which had been expected. Had I pressed his being\r\nordered back, I have reason to believe the order would have been given.\r\nBut he would have gone back in ill humor with Congress, he would have laid\r\nforever at their door the failure of a promotion then viewed as certain;\r\nand this might have excited dispositions that would have disappointed us\r\nof the good we hoped from his return. The line I have observed with him\r\nhas been, to make him sensible that nothing was more desired by Congress\r\nthan his return, but that they would not willingly press it, so as to\r\ndefeat him of a personal advantage. He sees his prospects fail, and will\r\nreturn in the approaching spring, unless something unexpected should turn\r\nup in his favor. In this case, the Count de Moutier has the promise of\r\nsucceeding to him, and, if I do not mistake his character, he would give\r\ngreat satisfaction. So that I think you may calculate on seeing one or the\r\nother, by midsummer.\r\n\r\nIt had been suspected that France and England might adopt those concerted\r\nregulations of commerce for their West Indies, of which your letter\r\nexpresses some apprehensions. But the expressions in the 4th, 5th, 7th,\r\n11th, 18th, and other articles of their treaty, which communicate to the\r\nEnglish the privileges of the most favored _European_ nation only, has\r\nlessened, if not removed those fears. They have clearly reserved a right\r\nof favoring, specially, any nation not European; and there is no nation\r\nout of Europe, who could so probably have been in their eye at that\r\ntime, as ours. They are wise. They must see it probable, at least, that\r\nany concert with England, will be but of short duration; and they could\r\nhardly propose to sacrifice for that, a connection with us, which may be\r\nperpetual.\r\n\r\nWe have been for some days in much inquietude for the Count de Vergennes.\r\nHe is very seriously ill. Nature seems struggling to decide his disease\r\ninto a gout. A swelled foot, at present, gives us a hope of this issue.\r\nHis loss would at all times have been great; but it would be immense\r\nduring the critical poise of European affairs existing at this moment. I\r\nenclose you a letter from one of the foreign officers, complaining of the\r\nnonpayment of their interest. It is only one out of many I have received.\r\nThis is accompanied by a second copy of the Moorish declaration sent me\r\nby Mr. Barclay. He went to Alicant to settle with Mr. Lambe; but on his\r\narrival there, found he was gone to Minorca. A copy of his letter will\r\ninform you of this circumstance, and of some others relative to Algiers,\r\nwith his opinion on them. Whatever the States may enable Congress to do\r\nfor obtaining the peace of that country, it is a separate question whether\r\nthey will redeem our captives, how, and at what price. If they decide to\r\nredeem them, I will beg leave to observe, that it is of great importance\r\nthat the first redemption be made at as low a price as possible, because\r\nit will form the future tariff. If these pirates find that they can have\r\na very great price for Americans, they will abandon proportionably their\r\npursuits against other nations, to direct them towards ours. That the\r\nchoice of Congress may be enlarged, as to the instruments they may use\r\nfor effecting the redemption, I think it my duty to inform them, that\r\nthere is here an order of priests called the Mathurins, the object of\r\nwhose institution is to beg alms for the redemption of captives. They keep\r\nmembers always in Barbary, searching out the captives of their country,\r\nand redeem, I believe, on better terms than any other body, public or\r\nprivate. It occurred to me, that their agency might be obtained for the\r\nredemption of our prisoners at Algiers. I obtained conference with the\r\nGeneral, and with some members of the order. The General, with all the\r\nbenevolence and cordiality possible, undertook to act for us, if we should\r\ndesire it. He told me that their last considerable redemption was of\r\nabout three hundred prisoners, who cost them somewhat upwards of fifteen\r\nhundred livres apiece; but that they should not be able to redeem ours\r\nas cheap as they do their own; and that it must be absolutely unknown\r\nthat the public concern themselves in the operation, or the price would\r\nbe greatly enhanced. The difference of religion was not once mentioned,\r\nnor did it appear to me to be thought of. It was a silent reclamation and\r\nacknowledgment of fraternity, between two religions of the same family,\r\nwhich historical events of ancient date had rendered more hostile to one\r\nanother, than to their common adversaries. I informed the General, that\r\nI should communicate the good dispositions of his order to those who\r\nalone had the authority to decide whatever related to our captives. Mr.\r\nCarmichael informs me, that moneys have been advanced for the support of\r\nour prisoners at Algiers, which ought to be replaced. I infer from the\r\ncontext of his letter, that these advances have been made by the court of\r\nMadrid. I submit the information to Congress.\r\n\r\nA treaty of commerce is certainly concluded between France and Russia. The\r\nparticulars of it are yet secret.\r\n\r\nI enclose the gazettes of France and Leyden to this time, and have the\r\nhonor of assuring you of those sentiments of perfect esteem and respect\r\nwith which I am, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. SOULÉS.\r\n\r\n                                                          February 2, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I send you the papers M. de Creve-coeur sent to Normandy for.\r\nThe account of the destruction of Wyoming begins page 40. You may rely\r\ncertainly on the author's facts, and you will be easily able to separate\r\nfrom them his reflections. You can best judge whether an account of that\r\ninteresting settlement, condensed into a few lines, might not form an\r\nagreeable episode in your history, and prepare the mind more awfully for\r\nits final catastrophe. I will thank you to return these papers as soon\r\nas you are done with them that I may restore them to the hands of M. de\r\nCreve-coeur before my departure, which will now be in a few days. I have\r\nthe honor to be, Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY MR. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, February 6, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favors by Colonel Franks have come safely to hand. He will\r\nset out from thence the 8th instant. The packet being to sail from Havre\r\nthe 10th, I enclose you the copy of a letter lately received from Mr.\r\nBarclay, and of the paper it enclosed. In a letter from Mr. Carmichael, is\r\na postscript, dated December 25, in the following words: \"Since writing\r\nthe preceding, the Portuguese ambassador has pressed me to hint, that\r\nthe present moment is favorable to push our treaty with the court.\" In\r\nthe body of the letter he says: \"The Count de Expilly has promised me to\r\ncontinue his attention to our prisoners during his stay at Algiers; and I\r\nhave also engaged the Consul of Spain, who remains there on his return,\r\nto take care of them. Advances have been made for their support which\r\nought to be refunded.\" I suppose these advances have been made by order of\r\nMr. Lambe, and that his powers being at an end, it will be incumbent on\r\nus to take measures on that subject. The Count de Vergennes is extremely\r\nill. His disease is gouty. We have for some days had hopes it would fix\r\nitself decidedly in the foot. It shows itself there at times, as also in\r\nthe shoulder, the stomach, &c. Monsieur de Calonnes is likewise ill, but\r\nhis complaints are of a rheumatic kind, which he has often had before.\r\nThe illness of these two ministers occasioned the postponement of the\r\nAssembly of the Notables to the 14th, and probably will yet postpone it.\r\nNothing is yet known of the objects of that meeting. I send you a pamphlet\r\ngiving a summary account of all the meetings of a general nature which\r\nhave taken place heretofore. The treaty between Prussia and this country\r\nis certainly concluded, but its contents are not yet known. I shall set\r\nout for the waters of Aix on the 13th instant, so that I am unable to say\r\nwhen and whence I shall have the honor of addressing you again. But I take\r\nmeasures for the conveying to me on my road all letters, so that should\r\nanything extraordinary require it, I can at all times be recalled to Paris\r\nin a fortnight. I shall hope to hear from you at times, as if I were in\r\nParis. I thank you much for the valuable present of your book. The subject\r\nof it is interesting, and I am sure it is well treated. I shall take it\r\non my journey, that I may have time to study it. You told me once, you\r\nhad thought of writing on hereditary aristocracy. I wish you would carry\r\nit into execution. It would make a proper sequel to the present work. I\r\nwish you all possible happiness, and have the honor to be, with sentiments\r\nof sincere esteem and affection, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. BINGHAM.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, February 7, 1787.\r\n\r\nI know, Madam, that the twelve month is not yet expired; but it will be,\r\nnearly, before this will have the honor of being put into your hands.\r\nYou are then engaged to tell me, truly and honestly, whether you do not\r\nfind the tranquil pleasures of America, preferable to the empty bustle of\r\nParis. For, to what does that bustle tend? At eleven o'clock, it is day,\r\n_chez madame_. The curtains are drawn. Propped on bolsters and pillows,\r\nand her head scratched into a little order, the bulletins of the sick are\r\nread, and the billets of the well. She writes to some of her acquaintance,\r\nand receives the visits of others. If the morning is not very thronged,\r\nshe is able to get out and hobble round the cage of the Palais Royal;\r\nbut she must hobble quickly, for the _coeffeur's_ turn is come; and a\r\ntremendous turn it is! Happy, if he does not make her arrive when dinner\r\nis half over! The torpitude of digestion a little passed, she flutters\r\nhalf an hour through the streets, by way of paying visits, and then to\r\nthe spectacles. These finished, another half hour is devoted to dodging\r\nin and out of the doors of her very sincere friends, and away to supper.\r\nAfter supper, cards; and after cards, bed; to rise at noon the next day,\r\nand to tread, like a mill horse, the same trodden circle over again. Thus\r\nthe days of life are consumed, one by one, without an object beyond the\r\npresent moment; ever flying from the ennui of that, yet carrying it with\r\nus; eternally in pursuit of happiness, which keeps eternally before us. If\r\ndeath or bankruptcy happen to trip us out of the circle, it is matter for\r\nthe buzz of the evening, and is completely forgotten by the next morning.\r\nIn America, on the other hand, the society of your husband, the fond\r\ncares for the children, the arrangements of the house, the improvements\r\nof the grounds, fill every moment with a healthy and an useful activity.\r\nEvery exertion is encouraging, because, to present amusement, it joins the\r\npromise of some future good. The intervals of leisure are filled by the\r\nsociety of real friends, whose affections are not thinned to cob-web, by\r\nbeing spread over a thousand objects. This is the picture, in the light it\r\nis presented to my mind; now let me have it in yours. If we do not concur\r\nthis year, we shall the next; or if not then, in a year or two more. You\r\nsee I am determined not to suppose myself mistaken.\r\n\r\nTo let you see that Paris is not changed in its pursuits, since it was\r\nhonored with your presence, I send you its monthly history. But this\r\nrelating only to the embellishments of their persons, I must add, that\r\nthose of the city go on well also. A new bridge, for example, is begun at\r\nthe Place Louis Quinze; the old ones are clearing off the rubbish which\r\nencumbered them in the form of houses; new hospitals erecting; magnificent\r\nwalls of inclosure, and Custom-houses at their entrances, &c., &c., &c.\r\nI know of no interesting change among those whom you honored with your\r\nacquaintance, unless Monsieur de Saint James was of that number. His\r\nbankruptcy, and taking asylum in the Bastile, have furnished matter of\r\nastonishment. His garden, at the Pont de Neuilly, where, on seventeen\r\nacres of ground, he had laid out fifty thousand louis, will probably sell\r\nfor somewhat less money. The workmen of Paris are making rapid strides\r\ntowards English perfection. Would you believe, that in the course of the\r\nlast two years, they have learned even to surpass their London rivals in\r\nsome articles? Commission me to have you a phaeton made, and, if it is not\r\nas much handsomer than a London one, as that is than a Fiacre, send it\r\nback to me. Shall I fill the box with caps, bonnets, &c.? Not of my own\r\nchoosing, but--I was going to say, of Mademoiselle Bertin's, forgetting,\r\nfor the moment, that she too is a bankrupt. They shall be chosen then by\r\nwhom you please; or, if you are altogether nonplused by her eclipse, we\r\nwill call an Assembleé des Notables to help you out of the difficulty, as\r\nis now the fashion. In short, honor me with your commands of any kind, and\r\nthey shall be faithfully executed. The packets now established from Havre\r\nto New York, furnish good opportunities of sending whatever you wish.\r\n\r\nI shall end where I began, like a Paris day, reminding you of your\r\nengagement to write me a letter of respectable length, an engagement the\r\nmore precious to me, as it has furnished the occasion, after presenting\r\nmy respects to Mr. Bingham, of assuring you of the sincerity of those\r\nsentiments of esteem and respect with which I have the honor to be, dear\r\nMadam, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, February 7, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have the honor of enclosing to your Excellency, a report of\r\nthe proceedings on the inauguration of the bust of the Marquis de La\r\nFayette in this city. This has been attended with a considerable, but\r\na necessary delay. The principle that the King is the sole fountain of\r\nhonor in this country opposed a barrier to our desires, which threatened\r\nto be insurmountable. No instance of a similar proposition from a foreign\r\npower, had occurred in their history. The admitting it in this case, is\r\na singular proof of the King's friendly disposition towards the States of\r\nAmerica, and of his personal esteem for the Marquis de La Fayette.\r\n\r\nI take this, the earliest occasion, of congratulating my country on your\r\nExcellency's appointment to the chair of government, and of assuring you\r\nwith great sincerity, of those sentiments of perfect esteem and respect,\r\nwith which I have the honor to be, your Excellency's most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, February 8, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The packet being to sail the day after tomorrow, I have awaited\r\nthe last possible moment of writing by her, in hopes I might be able to\r\nannounce some favorable change in the situation of the Count de Vergennes.\r\nBut none has occurred, and in the meantime he has become weaker by the\r\ncontinuance of his illness. Though not desperately ill, he is dangerously\r\nso. The Comptroller General, M. de Calonnes, has been very ill also, but\r\nhe is getting well. These circumstances have occasioned the postponement\r\nof the Assemblée des Notables to the 14th instant, and will probably\r\noccasion a further postponement. As I shall set out this day se'nnight\r\nfor the waters of Aix, you will probably hear the issue of the Count de\r\nVergennes' illness through some other channel, before I shall have the\r\nhonor of addressing you again. I may observe the same, as to the final\r\ndecision for the _effranchisement_ of Honfleur, which is in a fair way\r\nof being speedily concluded. The exertions of Monsieur de Creve-coeur,\r\nand particularly his influence with the Duke d'Harcourt, the principal\r\ninstrument in effecting it, have been of chief consequence in this matter.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DUMAS.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, February 9, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--My last to you was dated December 25th; since which I have been\r\nhonored with your several favors of December the 29th, January the 5th,\r\n9th and 23d. I thought that your affairs could not be more interesting\r\nthan they have been for a considerable time. Yet in the present moment\r\nthey are become more so, by the apparent withdrawing of so considerable a\r\npersonage in the drama, as the King of Prussia. To increase this interest,\r\nanother person, whose importance scarcely admits calculation, is in a\r\nsituation which fills us with alarm. Nature is struggling to relieve\r\nhim by a decided gout; she has my sincere prayers to aid her, as I am\r\npersuaded she has yours. I have letters and papers from America, as late\r\nas the 15th of December. The government of Massachusetts had imprisoned\r\nthree of the leaders of their insurgents. The insurgents, being collected\r\nto the number of three or four hundred, had sent in their petition to\r\nthe government, praying another act of pardon for their leaders and\r\nthemselves, and, on this condition, offering to go every man home, and\r\nconduct himself dutifully afterwards. This is the latest intelligence.\r\n\r\nI thank you for your attention to the question I had taken the liberty of\r\nproposing to you. I think with you, that it would be advisable to have our\r\ndebt transferred to individuals of your country. There could, and would be\r\nno objection to the guarantee remaining as you propose; and a postponement\r\nof the first payments of capital, would surely be a convenience to us.\r\nFor though the resources of the United States are great and growing, and\r\ntheir dispositions good, yet their machine is new, and they have not got\r\nit to go well. It is the object of their general wish at present, and they\r\nare all in movement, to set it in a good train; but their movements are\r\nnecessarily slow. They will surely effect it in the end, because all have\r\nthe same end in view; the difficulty being only to get all the thirteen\r\nStates to agree on the same means. Divesting myself of every partiality,\r\nand speaking from that thorough knowledge which I have of the country,\r\ntheir resources and their principles, I had rather trust money in their\r\nhands, than in that of any government on earth; because, though for\r\nawhile the payments of the interest might be less regular, yet the final\r\nreimbursement of the capital would be more sure.\r\n\r\nI set out next week for the south of France, to try whether some mineral\r\nwaters in that quarter, much recommended, will restore the use of my hand.\r\nI shall be absent from Paris two or three months; but I take arrangements\r\nfor the regular receipt of your favors, as if I were here. It will be\r\nbetter, however, for you to put your letters to Mr. Jay, under cover to\r\nMr. Short, who remains here, and will forward them.\r\n\r\nI have thought it my duty to submit to Congress the proposition about the\r\nFrench debt, and may expect their answer in four months.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sincere esteem and respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. BORGNIS DESBORDES FRERES.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, February 12, 1787.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--Mr. Barclay, the American Consul General for France, being at\r\npresent out of the kingdom, I have given orders to Mr. Grand, banker at\r\nParis, to pay your draught for one hundred and eighty-six livres, advanced\r\nby you for the relief of the shipwrecked Americans. I thank you for your\r\nattention to these unfortunate people. It will rest with Mr. Barclay to\r\ngive such future directions as he shall think proper for cases of this\r\nkind, which properly fall within the consular department. A certainty\r\nthat your kindness will meet his thanks, and that my interference in his\r\nabsence will be approved, has engaged me to do it without any hesitation.\r\nI am just setting out on a journey of two or three months, but Mr. Grand,\r\nas I have before mentioned, will pay your draught for the 168 livres\r\nwhenever you shall be pleased to make it. I have the honor to be, with\r\nsentiments of the most perfect esteem and respect, Gentlemen, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY MR. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, February 14, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--As I propose to write you on business by Mr. Cairnes, who will\r\nset out in a few days for London, the object of the present letter is only\r\nto inform you that the Count de Vergennes died yesterday morning, and that\r\nthe Count de Montmorin is appointed his successor, and further to beg the\r\nfavor of you to forward the enclosed by the first vessel from London. I\r\nset out on my journey on Sunday the 18th. I have the honor to be, with\r\nsentiments of very sincere affection and respect, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, February 14, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In the letter of the 8th instant, which I had the honor of writing\r\nyou, I informed you that the Count de Vergennes was dangerously ill.\r\nHe died yesterday morning, and the Count de Montmorin is appointed\r\nhis successor. Your personal knowledge of this gentleman, renders it\r\nunnecessary for me to say anything of him.\r\n\r\nMr. Morris, during his office, being authorized to have the medals and\r\nswords executed, which had been ordered by Congress, he authorized Colonel\r\nHumphreys to take measures here for the execution. Colonel Humpreys did\r\nso; and the swords were finished in time for him to carry them. The medals\r\nnot being finished, he desired me to attend to them. The workman who was\r\nto make that of General Greene, brought me yesterday, the medal in gold,\r\ntwenty-three in copper, and the dye. Mr. Short, during my absence, will\r\navail himself of the first occasion which shall offer, of forwarding\r\nthe medals to you. I must beg leave, through you, to ask the pleasure of\r\nCongress as to the number they would choose to have struck. Perhaps they\r\nmight be willing to deposit one of each person, in every college of the\r\nUnited States. Perhaps they might choose to give a series of them, to each\r\nof the crowned heads of Europe, which would be an acceptable present to\r\nthem. They will be pleased to decide. In the meantime, I have sealed up\r\nthe dye, and shall retain it till I am honored with their orders as to\r\nthis medal, and the others also, when they shall be finished.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. LE PREVOT DES MARCHANDS ET ECHEVINS DE PARIS.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, February 18, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am now to acknowledge the receipt of the letter with which\r\nyou have been pleased to honor me, together with the report on the\r\ninauguration of the bust of the Major General the Marquis de La Fayette.\r\nI availed myself of an opportunity which offered in the moment, of\r\ntransmitting them to the State of Virginia, with a faithful representation\r\nof the favor with which the Prevot des Marchands et Echevins de Paris\r\nreceived their proposition, the zeal with which it was pursued, and the\r\ndignity of its ultimate execution. Knowing the attachment of my country\r\nto the character which was the subject of that transaction, and the price\r\nthey will set on the attentions of the magistracy of Paris, I am safe in\r\nassuring you that they will feel themselves infinitely obliged on this\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nThe interest you are pleased to take in the happiness of our infant\r\nStates, your judicious admonitions as to the means of preserving it, and\r\nthe terms in which you particularly honor some of their members, require\r\nmy personal thanks, which I humbly offer, with all those sentiments of\r\nhomage and respect with which I have the honor to be, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, February 18, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My last to you was dated December 26, since which I have been\r\nhonored with yours of December 17. I now enclose you a duplicate of the\r\nvote for the recall of Mr. Lambe. I take the liberty, also, of putting\r\nunder cover to you our confirmation of the Morocco treaty, together with a\r\njoint letter to Fennish. The fear that Mr. Barclay might not be at Madrid\r\nhas occasioned my giving you this trouble, as well as that of addressing\r\nthe letter properly, and of having it transmitted.\r\n\r\nI have received from Mr. Jay sundry despatches relative to the frigate the\r\nSouth Carolina, and to a claim against the Court of Madrid founded on the\r\naid of that vessel in taking the Bahama and Providence islands, with an\r\ninstruction from Congress to confer with the Prince of Luxembourg, and get\r\nhim to interest the Duke de La Vauguyon to join you in your solicitations\r\nof this matter. This is accordingly done, and you will have the aid of\r\nthe Duke. The despatches relative to this subject, I have sealed up and\r\naddressed to you, but they will be delivered to the Duke de La Vauguyon,\r\nto find a safe occasion of forwarding them. My last news from America\r\nwas of the 15th of December. The insurgents of Massachusetts had sent in\r\na petition to their government, praying the release of their leaders in\r\njail, and an act of pardon for themselves, and offering thereon to retire\r\nevery man to his home and to live submissively. You will have heard of the\r\ndeath of the Count de Vergennes, and appointment of Mons. de Montmorin.\r\nI was unlucky enough five months ago to dislocate my right wrist, and\r\nthough well set, I have as yet no use of it, except that I can write,\r\nbut in pain. I am advised to try the use of mineral waters, and those of\r\nAix in Provence being as much recommended as any others, I combine with\r\nthis object a design of making the tour of those seaports with which\r\nwe trade, Marseilles, Bordeaux, Nantes, &c., and shall set out the day\r\nafter to-morrow, and expect to be absent three months. This may probably\r\nprevent my having the honor of writing to you during that interval, unless\r\nanything extraordinary should arise. I take measures for the receipt of\r\nall letters addressed to me as regularly as were I here. I have the honor\r\nto be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir, your\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BARCLAY.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, February 18, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am now to acknowledge your separate favors of December 4th\r\nand January 6th, and the joint one to Mr. Adams and myself of January 6th;\r\nthis last has been communicated to Congress, and to Mr. Adams. You have\r\nmy full and hearty approbation of the treaty you obtained from Morocco,\r\nwhich is better and on better terms than I expected. Mr. Adams and myself\r\nhave annexed our confirmation to two of the copies, one of which is gone\r\nto Congress; the other, with a joint letter to Fennish, I now enclose to\r\nMr. Carmichael, apprehending you are not in Madrid. I concur clearly with\r\nyou in opinion that, for many reasons, Mr. Carmichael would be a proper\r\nperson to negotiate our business with Algiers, if it be negotiable with\r\nsuch means as we possess. I have expressed this opinion in my letters to\r\nAmerica, but I am sure we cannot raise the money necessary. Colonel Franks\r\nwas gone to London before I received your letter. He returned and embarked\r\nin the packet for Havre, but nothing was done on the subject of accounts\r\nor money. I was unlucky enough to dislocate my right wrist five months\r\nago, and though it was well set, I can yet make no use of it but to write.\r\nI am advised to try mineral waters, and those of Aix in Provence, being as\r\nmuch recommended as any others, I am induced to go to them by the desire\r\nof making the tour of the ports with which we trade, Marseilles, Bordeaux,\r\nNantes, &c. I set out in two days and shall be absent three months. The\r\npackets are finally fixed at Havre. They sail every six weeks. Honfleur\r\nwill, I think, certainly be made a free port; and I flatter myself will\r\nbecome the centre for much of our trade, and particularly that of rice.\r\nThe death of Count de Vergennes, and appointment of Monsieur de Montmorin,\r\nwill reach you before this letter does. I have letters, &c., from America\r\nas late as the 15th of December. The insurgents of Massachusetts had\r\nprayed pardon for themselves and their leaders in jail, and on these terms\r\nhad offered to retire and live peaceably at home. Mrs. Barclay and your\r\nfamily are well, except they are somewhat apprehensive of a film growing\r\nover the eye of your youngest daughter; but should it do so, it will be\r\neasily removed. I have the honor to be, with much esteem and respect, dear\r\nSir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, February 20, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am now to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of January\r\n25th. Colonel Franks sailed in the packet of this month from Havre for New\r\nYork. The arrangement of the packets opens a direct communication between\r\nParis and America, and if we succeed, as I expect we will, in getting\r\nHonfleur made a free port, I hope to see that place become the deposit for\r\nour whale oil, rice, tobacco and furs, and that, from thence, what is not\r\nwanted in the country may be distributed to others. You remember giving\r\nme a letter of credit on Messrs. Willinck and Staphorst for one thousand\r\nguineas to pay for the swords and medals. When the swords were finished, I\r\ndrew on the Vandemjers, with whom the money was deposited, for sixty-five\r\nthousand livres, to pay for the swords. They paid it. A medal is now\r\nfinished, and others will very soon be. But these gentlemen say they must\r\nhave fresh orders. In the meantime, the workmen complain. Will you be so\r\ngood as to draw in favor of Mr. Grand on Willinck, &c., for the balance of\r\nthe thousand guineas (which is about the sum that will be necessary), and\r\nsend the bill to Mr. Grand, who, in my absence, will negotiate it and pay\r\nthe workmen. I enclose you Vandemjer's answer. The meeting of the Notables\r\non Thursday, and the necessity of paying my court to our new minister,\r\nwill detain me till Friday, and perhaps till Tuesday next. Nothing is\r\nknown yet of the objects of this Assembly. I enclose you two new pamphlets\r\nrelative to it, and will inform you of whatever I can discover relative to\r\nit during my stay. I learn with real pain the resolution you have taken\r\nof quitting Europe. Your presence on this side the Atlantic gave me a\r\nconfidence that, if any difficulties should arise within my department,\r\nI should always have one to advise with, on whose counsels I could rely.\r\nI shall now feel bewidowed. I do not wonder at your being tired out by\r\nthe conduct of the court you are at. But is there not room to do a great\r\ndeal of good for us in Holland in the department of money? No one can\r\ndo it as well as yourself. But you have taken your resolution on mature\r\nconsideration, and I have nothing to offer, therefore, but my regrets.\r\nIf anything transpires from the Notables before my departure worth\r\ncommunication, you shall yet hear from me. In the meantime, believe me\r\nto be, with sincere esteem and respect, dear Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY MR. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, February 23, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The Notables met yesterday; the King opened the Assembly with\r\na short speech, wherein he expressed his inclination to consult with them\r\non the affairs of his kingdom, to receive their opinions on the plans he\r\nhad digested, and to endeavor to imitate the head of his family, Henry\r\nIV., whose name is so dear to the nation. The speech was affectionate.\r\nThe Garde des Sceaux spoke about twenty minutes, complimented the clergy,\r\nthe noblesse, the magistrates and tiers etats. The Comptroller General\r\nspoke about an hour. He enumerated the expenses necessary to arrange his\r\ndepartment when he came into it; he said his returns had been minutely\r\nlaid before the King; he took a review of the preceding administrations,\r\nand more particularly of Mr. Neckar's; he detailed the improvement\r\nwhich had been made; he portrayed the present state of the finances, and\r\nsketched the several schemes proposed for their improvement; he spoke on a\r\nchange in the form of the taxes, the removal of the interior custom-houses\r\nto the frontiers, provincial administrations and some other objects.\r\nThe Assembly was then divided into committees. To-day, there was to be\r\nanother grand Assembly, the plans more fully explained and referred to the\r\ndiscussion of the committees. The grand Assembly will meet once a week and\r\nvote individually. The propriety of my attending the first audience day\r\nof Count Montmorin, which will not be till the 27th, retards my departure\r\ntill then.\r\n\r\nI have read your book with infinite satisfaction and improvement. It will\r\ndo great good in America. Its learning and its good sense will, I hope,\r\nmake it an institute for our politicians, old as well as young. There is\r\none opinion in it, however, which I will ask you to reconsider, because it\r\nappears to me not entirely accurate, and not likely to do good. Page 362,\r\n\"Congress is not a legislative, but a diplomatic assembly.\" Separating\r\ninto parts the whole sovereignty of our States, some of these parts are\r\nyielded to Congress. Upon these I should think them both legislative\r\nand executive, and that would have been judiciary also, had not the\r\nconfederation required them for certain purposes to appoint a judiciary.\r\nIt has accordingly been the decision of our courts that the confederation\r\nis a part of the law of the land, and superior in authority to the\r\nordinary laws, because it cannot be altered by the legislature of any one\r\nState. I doubt whether they are at all a diplomatic assembly. On the first\r\nnews of this work there were proposals to translate it. Fearing it might\r\nbe murdered in that operation, I endeavored to secure a good translator.\r\nThis is done, and I lend him my copy to translate from. It will be\r\nimmediately announced to keep others from attempting it. I am, with\r\nsincere esteem and respect, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, February 23, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The Assemblée des Notables being an event in the history of this\r\ncountry which excites notice, I have supposed it would not be disagreeable\r\nto you to learn its immediate objects, though no way connected with\r\nour interests. The Assembly met yesterday; the King, in a short but\r\naffectionate speech, informed them of his wish to consult with them on\r\nthe plans he had digested, and on the general good of his people, and\r\nhis desire to imitate the head of his family, Henry IV., whose memory\r\nis so dear to the nation. The Garde des Sceaux then spoke about twenty\r\nminutes, chiefly in compliment to the orders present. The Comptroller\r\nGeneral, in a speech of about an hour, opened the budget, and enlarged on\r\nthe several subjects which will be under their deliberation. He explained\r\nthe situation of the finances at his accession to office, the expenses\r\nwhich their arrangement had rendered necessary, their present state, with\r\nthe improvements made in them, the several plans which had been proposed\r\nfor their future improvement, a change in the form of some of their\r\ntaxes, the removal of the interior custom-houses to the frontiers, and\r\nthe institution of Provincial Assemblies. The Assembly was then divided\r\ninto committees, with a prince of the blood at the head of each. In this\r\nform, they are to discuss separately the subjects which will be submitted\r\nto them. Their decision will be reported by two members to the minister,\r\nwho, on view of the separate decisions of all the committees, will make\r\nsuch changes in his plans as will best accommodate them to their views,\r\nwithout too much departing from his own, and will then submit them to the\r\nvote (but I believe not to the debate) of the General Assembly, which\r\nwill be convened for this purpose one day in every week, and will vote\r\nindividually.\r\n\r\nThe event of the Count de Vergennes' death, of which I had the honor to\r\ninform you in a letter of the 14th instant, the appointment of the Count\r\nMontmorin, and the propriety of my attending at his first audience, which\r\nwill be on the 27th, have retarded the journey I had proposed, a few days.\r\n\r\nI shall hope, on my return, to meet here new powers for the consular\r\nconvention, as under those I have, it will be impossible to make the\r\nchanges in the convention which may be wished for.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO RICHARD PETERS.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, February 26, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of October 1, covering the letter and bill to\r\nCaptain Capitaine, did not come to my hands till yesterday. I wrote to\r\nhim immediately, to inform him it should be delivered here at any moment.\r\nWe talk and think of nothing here but the Assemblée des Notables. Were\r\nall the puns collected, to which this Assembly has given rise, I think\r\nthey would make a larger volume than the Encyclopedie. The government is\r\nsaid to want eighty millions of livres revenue more than they have. They\r\npropose to give to the people provincial administrations, and to make\r\nother improvements. It is a pity they had not more of the virtue called\r\neconomy, of which we have something to spare. I hope the company of Mrs.\r\nPeters and your little ones have cured all your aches and pains both of\r\nbody and mind. That you and they may continue forever clear of them, is\r\nthe sincere prayer of, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, February 28, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am just now in the moment of my departure. Monsieur de\r\nMontmorin having given us audience at Paris yesterday, I missed the\r\nopportunity of seeing you once more. I am extremely pleased with his\r\nmodesty, the simplicity of his manners, and his dispositions toward us. I\r\npromise myself a great deal of satisfaction in doing business with him.\r\nI hope he will not give ear to any unfriendly suggestions. I flatter\r\nmyself I shall hear from you sometimes. Send your letters to my hotel,\r\nas usual, and they will be forwarded to me. I wish you success in your\r\nmeeting. I should form better hopes of it, if it were divided into two\r\nHouses, instead of seven. Keeping the good model of your neighboring\r\ncountry before your eyes, you may get on, step by step, towards a good\r\nconstitution. Though that model is not perfect, yet, as it would unite\r\nmore suffrages than any new one which could be proposed, it is better to\r\nmake that the object. If every advance is to be purchased by filling the\r\nroyal coffers with gold, it will be gold well employed. The King, who\r\nmeans so well, should be encouraged to repeat these Assemblies. You see\r\nhow we republicans are apt to preach, when we get on politics. Adieu, my\r\ndear friend. Yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MADAME LA COMTESSE DE TESSE.\r\n\r\n                                                    NISMES, March 20, 1787.\r\n\r\nHere I am, Madam, gazing whole hours at the Maison quarrée like a lover at\r\nhis mistress. The stocking weavers and silk spinners around it consider\r\nme a hypochondriac Englishman, about to write with a pistol the last\r\nchapter of his history. This is the second time I have been in love since\r\nI left Paris. The first was with a Diana at the Chateau de Laye-Epinaye\r\nin Beaujolois, a delicious morsel of sculpture, by M. A. Slodtz. This,\r\nyou will say, was in rule, to fall in love with a female beauty; but\r\nwith a house! it is out of all precedent. No, Madam, it is not without a\r\nprecedent in my own history. While in Paris, I was violently smitten with\r\nthe Hotel de Salm, and used to go to the Tuileries almost daily, to look\r\nat it. The _loueuse des chaises_, inattentive to my passion, never had\r\nthe complaisance to place a chair there, so that, sitting on the parapet,\r\nand twisting my neck round to see the object of my admiration, I generally\r\nleft it with a _torti-colli_.\r\n\r\nFrom Lyons to Nismes I have been nourished with the remains of Roman\r\ngrandeur. They have always brought you to my mind, because I know your\r\naffection for whatever is Roman and noble. At Vienne I thought of you.\r\nBut I am glad you were not there; for you would have seen me more angry\r\nthan, I hope, you will ever see me. The Prætorian Palace, as it is called,\r\ncomparable, for its fine proportions, to the Maison quarrée, defaced by\r\nthe barbarians who have converted it to its present purpose, its beautiful\r\nfluted Corinthian columns cut out, in part, to make space for Gothic\r\nwindows, and hewed down, in the residue, to the plane of the building, was\r\nenough, you must admit, to disturb my composure. At Orange, too, I thought\r\nof you. I was sure you had seen with pleasure the sublime triumphal arch\r\nof Marius at the entrance of the city. I went then to the Arenæ. Would\r\nyou believe, Madam, that in this eighteenth century, in France, under the\r\nreign of Louis XVI., they are at this moment pulling down the circular\r\nwall of this superb remain, to pave a road? And that, too, from a hill\r\nwhich is itself an entire mass of stone, just as fit, and more accessible?\r\nA former intendant, a M. de Basville, has rendered his memory dear to\r\nthe traveller and amateur, by the pains he took to preserve and restore\r\nthese monuments of antiquity. The present one (I do not know who he is)\r\nis demolishing the object, to make a good road to it. I thought of you\r\nagain, and I was then in great good humor, at the Pont du Gard, a sublime\r\nantiquity, and well preserved. But most of all here, where Roman taste,\r\ngenius, and magnificence, excite ideas analogous to yours at every step. I\r\ncould no longer oppose the inclination to avail myself of your permission\r\nto write to you, a permission given with too much complaisance by you,\r\nand used by me with too much indiscretion. Madame de Tott did me the same\r\nhonor. But she, being only the descendant of some of those puny heroes who\r\nboiled their own kettles before the walls of Troy, I shall write to her\r\nfrom a Grecian, rather than a Roman canton; when I shall find myself, for\r\nexample, among her Phocæan relations at Marseilles.\r\n\r\nLoving, as you do madam, the precious remains of antiquity, loving\r\narchitecture, gardening, a warm sun and a clear sky, I wonder you have\r\nnever thought of moving Chaville to Nismes. This, as you know, has\r\nnot always been deemed impracticable; and, therefore, the next time a\r\n_Sur-intendant des batiments du roi_, after the example of M. Colbert,\r\nsends persons to Nismes to move the Maison quarrée to Paris, that they\r\nmay not come empty handed, desire them to bring Chaville with them, to\r\nreplace it. Apropos of Paris. I have now been three weeks from there,\r\nwithout knowing anything of what has passed. I suppose I shall meet it all\r\nat Aix, where I have directed my letters to be lodged, _poste restante_.\r\nMy journey has given me leisure to reflect on this Assemblée des Notables.\r\nUnder a good and a young King, as the present, I think good may be made of\r\nit. I would have the deputies then, by all means, so conduct themselves as\r\nto encourage him to repeat the calls of this Assembly. Their first step\r\nshould be, to get themselves divided into two chambers instead of seven;\r\nthe Noblesse and the Commons separately. The second, to persuade the King,\r\ninstead of choosing the deputies of the Commons himself, to summon those\r\nchosen by the people for the Provincial administrations. The third, as the\r\nNoblesse is too numerous to be all of the Assemblée, to obtain permission\r\nfor that body to choose its own deputies. Two Houses, so elected, would\r\ncontain a mass of wisdom which would make the people happy, and the King\r\ngreat; would place him in history where no other act can possibly place\r\nhim. They would thus put themselves in the track of the best guide they\r\ncan follow; they would soon overtake it, become its guide in turn, and\r\nlead to the wholesome modifications wanting in that model, and necessary\r\nto constitute a rational government. Should they attempt more than the\r\nestablished habits of the people are ripe for, they may lose all, and\r\nretard indefinitely the ultimate object of their aim. These, Madam, are my\r\nopinions; but I wish to know yours, which, I am sure, will be better.\r\n\r\nFrom a correspondent at Nismes, you will not expect news. Were I to\r\nattempt to give you news, I should tell you stories one thousand years\r\nold. I should detail to you the intrigues of the courts of the Cæsars, how\r\nthey affect us here, the oppressions of their prætors, prefects, &c. I am\r\nimmersed in antiquities from morning to night. For me, the city of Rome\r\nis actually existing in all the splendor of its empire. I am filled with\r\nalarms for the event of the irruptions daily making on us, by the Goths,\r\nthe Visigoths, Ostrogoths, and Vandals, lest they should re-conquer us to\r\nour original barbarism. If I am sometimes induced to look forward to the\r\neighteenth century, it is only when recalled to it by the recollection of\r\nyour goodness and friendship, and by those sentiments of sincere esteem\r\nand respect with which I have the honor to be Madam, your most obedient,\r\nand most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\n                                                      NICE, April 11, 1787.\r\n\r\nYour head, my dear friend, is full of notable things; and being better\r\nemployed, therefore, I do not expect letters from you. I am constantly\r\nroving about, to see what I have never seen before, and shall never see\r\nagain. In the great cities, I go to see what travellers think alone worthy\r\nof being seen; but I make a job of it, and generally gulp it all down in\r\na day. On the other hand, I am never satiated with rambling through the\r\nfields and farms, examining the culture and cultivators, with a degree of\r\ncuriosity which makes some take me to be a fool, and others to be much\r\nwiser than I am. I have been pleased to find among the people a less\r\ndegree of physical misery than I had expected. They are generally well\r\nclothed, and have a plenty of food, not animal indeed, but vegetable,\r\nwhich is as wholesome. Perhaps they are over-worked, the excess of the\r\nrent required by the landlord obliging them to too many hours of labor in\r\norder to produce that, and wherewith to feed and clothe themselves. The\r\nsoil of Champagne and Burgundy I have found more universally good than I\r\nhad expected, and as I could not help making a comparison with England,\r\nI found that comparison more unfavorable to the latter than is generally\r\nadmitted. The soil, the climate, and the productions are superior to\r\nthose of England, and the husbandry as good, except in one point; that of\r\nmanure. In England, long leases for twenty-one years, or three lives, to\r\nwit, that of the farmer, his wife, and son, renewed by the son as soon\r\nas he comes to the possession, for his own life, his wife's and eldest\r\nchild's, and so on, render the farms there almost hereditary, make it\r\nworth the farmer's while to manure the lands highly, and give the landlord\r\nan opportunity of occasionally making his rent keep pace with the improved\r\nstate of the lands. Here the leases are either during pleasure, or for\r\nthree, six, or nine years, which does not give the farmer time to repay\r\nhimself for the expensive operation of well manuring, and, therefore, he\r\nmanures ill, or not at all. I suppose, that could the practice of leasing\r\nfor three lives be introduced in the whole kingdom, it would, within the\r\nterm of your life, increase agricultural productions fifty per cent.; or\r\nwere any one proprietor to do it with his own lands, it would increase\r\nhis rents fifty per cent. in the course of twenty-five years. But I am\r\ntold the laws do not permit it. The laws then, in this particular, are\r\nunwise and unjust, and ought to give that permission. In the southern\r\nprovinces, where the soil is poor, the climate hot and dry, and there are\r\nfew animals, they would learn the art, found so precious in England, of\r\nmaking vegetable manure, and thus improving these provinces in the article\r\nin which nature has been least kind to them. Indeed, these provinces\r\nafford a singular spectacle. Calculating on the poverty of their soil,\r\nand their climate by its latitude only, they should have been the poorest\r\nin France. On the contrary, they are the richest, from one fortuitous\r\ncircumstance. Spurs or ramifications of high mountains, making down from\r\nthe Alps, and, as it were, reticulating these provinces, give to the\r\nvalleys the protection of a particular inclosure to each, and the benefit\r\nof a general stagnation of the northern winds produced by the whole of\r\nthem, and thus countervail the advantage of several degrees of latitude.\r\nFrom the first olive fields of Pierrelatte, to the orangeries of Hieres,\r\nhas been continued rapture to me. I have often wished for you. I think\r\nyou have not made this journey. It is a pleasure you have to come, and\r\nan improvement to be added to the many you have already made. It will be\r\na great comfort to you, to know, from your own inspection, the condition\r\nof all the provinces of your own country, and it will be interesting to\r\nthem at some future day, to be known to you. This is, perhaps, the only\r\nmoment of your life in which you can acquire that knowledge. And to do it\r\nmost effectually, you must be absolutely incognito, you must ferret the\r\npeople out of their hovels as I have done, look into their kettles, eat\r\ntheir bread, loll on their beds under pretence of resting yourself, but\r\nin fact, to find if they are soft. You will feel a sublime pleasure in the\r\ncourse of this investigation, and a sublimer one hereafter, when you shall\r\nbe able to apply your knowledge to the softening of their beds, or the\r\nthrowing a morsel of meat into their kettle of vegetables.\r\n\r\nYou will not wonder at the subjects of my letters; they are the only ones\r\nwhich have been presented to my mind for some time past; and the waters\r\nmust always be what are the fountains from which they flow. According\r\nto this, indeed, I should have intermixed, from beginning to end, warm\r\nexpressions of friendship to you. But according to the ideas of our\r\ncountry, we do not permit ourselves to speak even truths, when they may\r\nhave the air of flattery. I content myself, therefore, with saying once\r\nfor all, that I love you, your wife and children. Tell them so, and adieu.\r\nYours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                                      NICE, April 12, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--At Marseilles, they told me I should encounter the rice fields\r\nof Piedmont soon after crossing the Alps. Here they tell me there are none\r\nnearer than Vercelli and Novarra, which is carrying me almost to Milan.\r\nI fear that this circumstance will occasion me a greater delay than I had\r\ncalculated on. However I am embarked in the project, and shall go through\r\nwith it. To-morrow, I set out on my passage over the Alps, being to\r\npursue it ninety-three miles to Coni, on mules, as the snows are not yet\r\nenough melted to admit carriages to pass. I leave mine here, therefore,\r\nproposing to return by water from Genoa. I think it will be three weeks\r\nbefore I get back to Nice. I find this climate quite as delightful as it\r\nhas been represented. Hieres is the only place in France, which may be\r\ncompared with it. The climates are equal. In favor of this place, are\r\nthe circumstances of gay and dissipated society, a handsome city, good\r\naccommodations, and some commerce. In favor of Hieres, are environs of\r\ndelicious and extensive plains, a society more contracted, and therefore\r\nmore capable of esteem, and the neighborhood of Toulon, Marseilles and\r\nother places, to which excursions may be made. Placing Marseilles in\r\ncomparison with Hieres, it has extensive society, a good theatre, freedom\r\nfrom military control, and the most animated commerce. But its winter\r\nclimate is far inferior. I am now in the act of putting my baggage into\r\nportable form for my bat-mule; after praying you therefore, to let my\r\ndaughter know I am well, and that I shall not be heard of again in three\r\nweeks, I take my leave of you for that time, with assurances of the\r\nsincere esteem with which I am, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                   MARSEILLES, May 4, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I had the honor of receiving at Aix your letter of February the 9th,\r\nand immediately wrote to the Count de Montmorin, explaining the delay\r\nof the answer of Congress to the King's letter, and desired Mr. Short\r\nto deliver that answer with my letter to Monsieur de Montmorin, which he\r\ninforms me he has accordingly done.\r\n\r\nMy absence prevented my noting to you, in the first moment, the revolution\r\nwhich has taken place at Paris, in the department of finance, by the\r\nsubstitution of Monsieur de Fourqueux in the place of Monsieur de\r\nCalonnes, so that you will have heard of it through other channels before\r\nthis will have the honor of reaching you.\r\n\r\nHaving staid at Aix long enough to prove the inefficacy of the waters,\r\nI came on to this place for the purpose of informing myself here, as I\r\nmean to do at the other sea-port towns, of whatever may be interesting to\r\nour commerce. So far as carried on in our own bottoms, I find it almost\r\nnothing, and so it must probably remain till something can be done with\r\nthe Algerines. Though severely afflicted with the plague, they have come\r\nout within these few days, and showed themselves in force along the coast\r\nof Genoa, cannonading a little town and taking several vessels.\r\n\r\nAmong other objects of inquiry, this was the place to learn something more\r\ncertain on the subject of rice, as it is a great emporium for that of the\r\nLevant and of Italy. I wished particularly to know whether it was the use\r\nof a different machine for cleaning, which brought European rice to market\r\nless broken than ours, as had been represented to me by those who deal\r\nin that article in Paris. I found several persons who had passed through\r\nthe rice country of Italy, but not one who could explain to me the nature\r\nof the machine. But I was given to believe that I might see it myself\r\nimmediately on entering Piedmont. As this would require but about three\r\nweeks, I determined to go and ascertain this point, as the chance only of\r\nplacing our rice above all rivalship in quality, as it is in color, by the\r\nintroduction of a better machine, if a better existed, seemed to justify\r\nthe application of that much time to it. I found the rice country to be in\r\ntruth Lombardy, one hundred miles further than had been represented, and\r\nthat though called Piedmont rice, not a grain is made in the country of\r\nPiedmont. I passed through the rice fields of the Venellese and Milanese,\r\nabout sixty miles, and returned from thence last night, having found that\r\nthe machine is absolutely the same as ours, and of course, that we need\r\nnot listen more to that suggestion. It is a difference in the species of\r\ngrain, of which the government of Turin is so sensible, that, as I was\r\ninformed, they prohibit the exportation of rough rice on pain of death. I\r\nhave taken measures, however, which I think will not fail for obtaining a\r\nquantity of it, and I bought on the spot a small parcel, which I have with\r\nme. As further details on this subject to Congress would be misplaced, I\r\npropose, on my return to Paris, to communicate them, and send the rice\r\nto the society at Charleston for promoting agriculture, supposing that\r\nthey will be best able to try the experiment of cultivating the rice of\r\nthis quality, and to communicate the species to the two States of South\r\nCarolina and Georgia, if they find it answer. I thought the staple of\r\nthese two States was entitled to this attention, and that it must be\r\ndesirable to them to be able to furnish rice of the two qualities demanded\r\nin Europe, especially, as the greater consumption is in the forms for\r\nwhich the Lombardy quality is preferred. The mass of our countrymen being\r\ninterested in agriculture, I hope I do not err in supposing that in a\r\ntime of profound peace, as the present, to enable them to adapt their\r\nproductions to the market, to point out markets for them, and endeavor to\r\nobtain favorable terms of reception, is within the line of my duty.\r\n\r\nMy journey into this part of the country has procured me information which\r\nI will take the liberty of communicating to Congress. In October last\r\nI received a letter dated Montpelier, October the 2d, 1786, announcing\r\nto me that the writer was a foreigner, who had a matter of very great\r\nconsequence to communicate to me, and desired I would indicate the channel\r\nthrough which it might pass safely. I did so.\r\n\r\nI received soon after a letter in the following words, omitting only the\r\nformal parts. [_A translation of it is here given._]\r\n\r\n\"I am a native of Brazil. You are not ignorant of the frightful slavery\r\nunder which my country groans. This continually becomes more insupportable\r\nsince the epoch of your glorious independence, for the cruel Portuguese\r\nomit nothing which can render our condition more wretched, from an\r\napprehension that we may follow your example. The conviction, that\r\nthese usurpers against the laws of nature and humanity only meditate\r\nnew oppressions, has decided us to follow the guiding light which you\r\nhave held out to us, to break our chains, to revive our almost expiring\r\nliberty, which is nearly overwhelmed by that force, which is the sole\r\nfoundation of the authority that Europeans exercise over America. But it\r\nis necessary that some power should extend assistance to the Brazilians,\r\nsince Spain would certainly unite herself with Portugal; and in spite of\r\nour advantages for defence, we could not make it effectual, or, at least,\r\nit would be imprudent to hazard the attempt without some assurance of\r\nsuccess. In this state of affairs, Sir, we can with propriety look only\r\nto the United States, not only because we are following her example, but,\r\nmoreover, because nature, in making us inhabitants of the same continent,\r\nhas in some sort united us in the bonds of a common patriotism. On our\r\npart, we are prepared to furnish the necessary supplies of money, and at\r\nall times to acknowledge the debt of gratitude due to our benefactors. I\r\nhave thus, Sir, laid before you a summary of my views. It is in discharge\r\nof this commission that I have come to France, since I could not effect\r\nit in America without exciting suspicion. It now remains for you to decide\r\nwhether those views can be accomplished. Should you desire to consult your\r\nnation on them, it is in my power to give you all the information you may\r\nrequire.\"\r\n\r\nAs, by this time, I had been advised to try the waters of Aix, I wrote\r\nto the gentleman my design, and that I would go off my road as far as\r\nNismes, under the pretext of seeing the antiquities of that place, if\r\nhe would meet me there. He met me, and the following is the sum of the\r\ninformation I received from him: \"Brazil contains as many inhabitants as\r\nPortugal. They are, 1. Portuguese. 2. Native whites. 3. Black and mulatto\r\nslaves. 4. Indians, civilized and savage. 1. The Portuguese are few in\r\nnumber, mostly married there, have lost sight of their native country,\r\nas well as the prospect of returning to it, and are disposed to become\r\nindependent. 2. The native whites form the body of their nation. 3. The\r\nslaves are as numerous as the free. 4. The civilized Indians have no\r\nenergy, and the savage would not meddle. There are twenty thousand regular\r\ntroops. Originally these were Portuguese. But as they died off, they\r\nwere replaced by natives, so that these compose at present the mass of\r\nthe troops, and may be counted on by their native country. The officers\r\nare partly Portuguese, partly Brazilians; their bravery is not doubted,\r\nand they understand the parade, but not the science of their profession.\r\nThey have no bias for Portugal, but no energy either for anything. The\r\npriests are partly Portuguese, partly Brazilians, and will not interest\r\nthemselves much. The Noblesse are scarcely known as such. They will,\r\nin no manner, be distinguished from the people. The men of letters are\r\nthose most desirous of a revolution. The people are not much under the\r\ninfluence of their priests, most of them read and write, possess arms,\r\nand are in the habit of using them for hunting. The slaves will take the\r\nside of their masters. In short, as to the question of revolution, there\r\nis but one mind in that country. But there appears no person capable\r\nof conducting a revolution, or willing to venture himself at its head,\r\nwithout the aid of some powerful nation, as the people of their own might\r\nfail them. There is no printing press in Brazil. They consider the North\r\nAmerican revolution as a precedent for theirs. They look to the United\r\nStates as most likely to give them honest support, and, from a variety of\r\nconsiderations, have the strongest prejudices in our favor. This informant\r\nis a native and inhabitant of Rio Janeiro, the present metropolis, which\r\ncontains fifty thousand inhabitants, knows well St. Salvador, the former\r\none, and the mines d'or, which are in the centre of the country. These are\r\nall for a revolution; and, constituting the body of the nation, the other\r\nparts will follow them. The King's fifth of the mines yields annually\r\nthirteen millions of crusadoes or half dollars. He has the sole right of\r\nsearching for diamonds and other precious stones, which yield him about\r\nhalf as much. His income from those two resources alone, then, is about\r\nten millions of dollars annually; but the remaining part of the produce of\r\nthe mines, being twenty-six millions, might be counted on for effecting a\r\nrevolution. Besides the arms in the hands of the people, there are public\r\nmagazines. They have abundance of horses, but only a part of their country\r\nwould admit the service of horses. They would want cannon, ammunition,\r\nships, sailors, soldiers and officers, for which they are disposed to\r\nlook to the United States, it being always understood that every service\r\nand furniture will be well paid. Corn costs about twenty livres the one\r\nhundred pounds. They have flesh in the greatest abundance, insomuch, that\r\nin some parts they kill beeves for the skin only. The whale fishery is\r\ncarried on by Brazilians altogether, and not by Portuguese; but in very\r\nsmall vessels, so that the fishermen know nothing of managing a large\r\nship. They would want of us, at all times, shipping, corn and salt fish.\r\nThe latter is a great article, and they are at present supplied with it\r\nfrom Portugal. Portugal, being without either army or navy, could not\r\nattempt an invasion under a twelvemonth. Considering of what it would\r\nbe composed, it would not be much to be feared, and, if it failed, they\r\nwould probably never attempt a second. Indeed, this source of their\r\nwealth being intercepted, they are scarcely capable of a first effort. The\r\nthinking part of the nation are so sensible of this, that they consider\r\nan early separation inevitable. There is an implacable hatred between the\r\nBrazilians and Portuguese; to reconcile which, a former minister adopted\r\nthe policy of letting the Brazilians into a participation of public\r\noffices, but subsequent administrations have reverted to the ancient\r\npolicy of keeping the administration in the hands of native Portuguese.\r\nThere is a mixture of natives of the old appointments still remaining in\r\noffice. If Spain should invade them on their southern extremities, these\r\nare so distant from the body of their settlements, that they could not\r\npenetrate thence; and Spanish enterprise is not formidable. The mines\r\nd'or are among mountains inaccessible to any army, and Rio Janeiro is\r\nconsidered the strongest port in the world after Gibraltar. In case of\r\na successful revolution, a republican government in a single body would\r\nprobably be established.\"\r\n\r\nI took care to impress on him, through the whole of our conversation,\r\nthat I had neither instructions nor authority to say a word to anybody on\r\nthis subject, and that I could only give him my own ideas, as a single\r\nindividual; which were, that we were not in a condition at present to\r\nmeddle nationally in any war; that we wished particularly to cultivate\r\nthe friendship of Portugal, with whom we have an advantageous commerce.\r\nThat yet a successful revolution in Brazil could not be uninteresting to\r\nus. That prospects of lucre might possibly draw numbers of individuals to\r\ntheir aid, and purer motives our officers, among whom are many excellent.\r\nThat our citizens being free to leave their own country individually,\r\nwithout the consent of their governments, are equally free to go to any\r\nother.\r\n\r\nA little before I received the first letter of the Brazilian, a\r\ngentleman informed me there was a Mexican in Paris, who wished to have\r\nsome conversation with me. He accordingly called on me. The substance\r\nof the information I drew from him was as follows. He is himself a\r\nnative of Mexico, where his relations are, principally. He left it at\r\nabout seventeen years of age, and seems now to be about thirty-three or\r\nthirty-four. He classes and characterizes the inhabitants of that country,\r\nas follows: 1. The natives of Old Spain, possessed of most of the offices\r\nof government, and firmly attached to it. 2. The clergy, equally attached\r\nto the government. 3. The natives of Mexico, generally disposed to revolt,\r\nbut without instruction, without energy, and much under the dominion of\r\ntheir priests. 4. The slaves, mulatto and black; the former enterprising\r\nand intelligent, the latter brave, and of very important weight, into\r\nwhatever scale they throw themselves; but he thinks they will side with\r\ntheir masters. 5. The conquered Indians, cowardly, not likely to take\r\nany side, nor important which they take. 6. The free Indians, brave and\r\nformidable, should they interfere, but not likely to do so, as being\r\nat a great distance. I asked him the numbers of these several classes,\r\nbut he could not give them. The first, he thought very inconsiderable;\r\nthat the second formed the body of the freemen; the third equal to the\r\ntwo first; the fourth, to all the preceding; and, as to the fifth, he\r\ncould form no idea of their proportion. Indeed, it appeared to me, that\r\nhis conjectures as to the others, were on loose grounds. He said he knew\r\nfrom good information, there were three hundred thousand inhabitants in\r\nthe city of Mexico. I was still more cautious with him than with the\r\nBrazilian, mentioning it as my private opinion (unauthorized to say a\r\nword on the subject otherwise) that a successful revolution was still at\r\na distance with them; that I feared they must begin by enlightening and\r\nemancipating the minds of their people; that, as to us, if Spain should\r\ngive us advantageous terms of commerce, and remove other difficulties, it\r\nwas not probable that we should relinquish certain and present advantages,\r\nthough smaller, for uncertain and future ones, however great. I was led\r\ninto this caution by observing that this gentleman was intimate at the\r\nSpanish ambassador's, and that he was then at Paris, employed by Spain to\r\nsettle her boundaries with France, on the Pyrenees. He had much the air of\r\ncandor, but that can be borrowed; so that I was not able to decide about\r\nhim in my own mind.\r\n\r\nLed by a unity of subject, and a desire to give Congress as general a view\r\nof the disposition of our southern countrymen, as my information enables\r\nme, I will add an article which, old and insulated, I did not think\r\nimportant enough to mention at the time I received it. You will remember,\r\nSir, that during the late war, the British papers often gave details\r\nof a rebellion in Peru. The character of those papers discredited the\r\ninformation. But the truth was, that the insurrections were so general,\r\nthat the event was long on the poise. Had Commodore Johnson, then expected\r\non that coast, touched and landed there two thousand men, the dominion\r\nof Spain in that country would have been at an end. They only wanted a\r\npoint of union, which this body would have constituted. Not having this,\r\nthey acted without concert, and were at length subdued separately. This\r\nconflagration was quenched in blood; two hundred thousand souls, on\r\nboth sides, having perished; but the remaining matter is very capable of\r\ncombustion. I have this information from a person who was on the spot at\r\nthe time, and whose good faith, understanding, and means of information,\r\nleave no doubt of the facts. He observed, however, that the numbers above\r\nsupposed to have perished, were on such conjectures only as he could\r\ncollect.\r\n\r\nI trouble Congress with these details, because, however distant, we may\r\nbe, both in condition and dispositions, from taking an active part in any\r\ncommotions in that country, nature has placed it too near us, to make its\r\nmovements altogether indifferent to our interests, or to our curiosity.\r\n\r\nI hear of another _Arret_ of this court, increasing the duties on foreign\r\nstock-fish, and the premium on their own, imported into their islands; but\r\nnot having yet seen it, I can say nothing certain on it. I hope the effect\r\nof this policy will be defeated by the practice which, I am told, takes\r\nplace on the Banks of Newfoundland, of putting our fish into the French\r\nfishing-boats, and the parties sharing the premium, instead of ours paying\r\nthe duty.\r\n\r\nI am in hopes Mr. Short will be able to send you the medals of General\r\nGates, by this packet. I await a general instruction as to these medals.\r\nThe academies of Europe will be much pleased to receive each a set.\r\n\r\nI propose to set out the day after to-morrow for Bordeaux, (by the canal\r\nof Languedoc,) Nantes, L'Orient and Paris.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. GUIDE.\r\n\r\n                                                   MARSEILLES, May 6, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--A desire of seeing a commerce commenced between the dominions of\r\nhis Majesty, the King of Sardinia, and the United States of America, and a\r\ndirect exchange of their respective productions, without passing through a\r\nthird nation, led me into the conversation which I had the honor of having\r\nwith you on that subject, and afterwards with Monsieur Tallon, at Turin,\r\nto whom I promised that I would explain to you, in writing, the substance\r\nof what passed between us. The articles of your produce wanted with us,\r\nare brandies, wines, oil, fruits, and manufactured silks: those with\r\nwhich we can furnish you, are indigo, potash, tobacco, flour, salt fish,\r\nfurs and peltries, ships and materials for building them. The supply of\r\ntobacco, particularly, being in the hands of government solely, appeared\r\nto me to offer an article for beginning immediately the experiment of\r\ndirect commerce. That of the first quality can be had, at first hand,\r\nonly from James river, in Virginia; those of the second and third, from\r\nthe same place and from Baltimore, in Maryland. The first quality is\r\ndelivered in the ports of France at thirty-eight livres the quintal,\r\nthe second at thirty-six livres, the third at thirty-four livres, weight\r\nand money of France, by individuals generally. I send you the copy of a\r\nlarge contract, wherein the three qualities are averaged at thirty-six\r\nlivres. They may be delivered at Nice for those prices. Indeed, it is my\r\nopinion, that by making shipments of your own produce to those places,\r\nand buying the tobaccos on the spot, they may be had more advantageously.\r\nIn this case, it would be expedient that merchants of Nice, Turin, and\r\nAmerica, should form a joint concern for conducting the business in the\r\ntwo countries. Monsieur Tallon desired me to point out proper persons in\r\nAmerica, who might be addressed for this purpose. The house of the most\r\nextensive reputation, concerned in the tobacco trade, and on the firmest\r\nfunds, is that of Messrs. Ross and Pleasants, at Richmond, in Virginia. If\r\nit should be concluded, on your part, to make any attempt of this kind,\r\nand to address yourselves to these gentlemen, or any others, it would be\r\nthe best to write them your ideas, and receive theirs, before you make\r\neither purchases or shipments. A more hasty conduct might occasion loss,\r\nand retard, instead of encouraging the establishment of this commerce.\r\nI would undertake to write, at the same time, to these, or any other\r\nmerchants whom you should prefer, in order to dispose them favorably,\r\nand as disinterestedly as possible, for the encouragement of this essay.\r\nI must observe to you, that our vessels are fearful of coming into\r\nthe Mediterranean on account of the Algerines; and that, if you should\r\nfreight vessels, those of the French will be most advantageous for you,\r\nbecause received into our ports without paying any duties on some of those\r\narticles, and lighter than others on all of them. English vessels, on\r\nthe other hand, are distinguished by paying heavier duties than those of\r\nany other nation. Should you desire any further information, or to pass\r\nletters with certainty to any mercantile house in America, do me the favor\r\nto address yourselves to me, at Paris, and I shall do whatever depends on\r\nme, for this object.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of high esteem and respect, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, June 14, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Having got back to Paris three days ago, I resume immediately\r\nthe correspondence with which you have been pleased to honor me. I wish\r\nI could have begun it with more agreeable information than that furnished\r\nme by Mr. Grand, that the funds of the United States here are exhausted,\r\nand himself considerably in advance; and by the board of treasury at New\r\nYork, that they have no immediate prospect of furnishing us supplies. We\r\nare thus left to shift for ourselves, without previous warning. As soon as\r\nthey shall replenish Mr. Grand's hands, I will give you notice, that you\r\nmay recommence your usual drafts on him; unless the board should provide a\r\nseparate fund for you, dependent on yourself alone, which I have strongly\r\nand repeatedly pressed on them, in order to remove the indecency of\r\nsuffering your drafts to pass through any intermediate hand for payment.\r\n\r\nMy letters from America came down to the 24th of April. The disturbances\r\nin the Eastern States were entirely settled. I do not learn that\r\nthe government had made any examples. Mr. Hancock's health being\r\nre-established, the want of which had occasioned him to resign the\r\ngovernment of Massachusetts, he has been re-elected to the exclusion of\r\nGovernor Bowdoin. New York still refuses to pass the impost in any form,\r\nand, were she to pass it, Pennsylvania will not uncouple it from the\r\nsupplementary funds. These two States and Virginia are the only ones, my\r\nletters say, which have paid anything into the Continental treasury, for\r\na twelve month past. I send you a copy of a circular letter from Congress\r\nto the several States, insisting on their removing all obstructions to the\r\nrecovery of British debts. This was hurried, that it might be delivered\r\nto the Assembly of New York before they rose. It was delivered, but\r\nthey did nothing in consequence of it. The convention to be assembled at\r\nPhiladelphia will be an able one. Ten States were known to have appointed\r\ndelegates. Maryland was about to appoint; Connecticut was doubtful; and\r\nRhode Island had refused. We are sure, however, of eleven States. South\r\nCarolina has prohibited the importation of slaves for three years; which\r\nis a step towards a perpetual prohibition. Between six and seven hundred\r\nthousand acres of land are actually surveyed into townships, and the sales\r\nare to begin immediately. They are not to be sold for less than a dollar\r\nthe acre, in public certificates. I wrote you from Bordeaux on the subject\r\nof Colonel Smith. I was sorry I missed him there, for other reasons as\r\nwell as from a curiosity to know his errand. The Notables have laid the\r\nfoundation of much good here; you have seen it detailed in the public\r\npapers. The Prince of Wales is likely to recover from his illness, which\r\nwas very threatening. It is feared that three powers have combined to lift\r\nthe Prince of Orange out of his difficulties. Have you yet the cypher of\r\nwhich I formerly wrote to you, or any copy of it?\r\n\r\nI am, with sincere esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DUMAS.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, June 14, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I arrived at this place three days ago, and avail myself of the\r\nfirst possible moment of acknowledging the receipt of your favors of the\r\n5th and 7th of June. The letters they accompanied for Mr. Jay shall be\r\nsent by the packet, which sails the 25th instant, and by a passenger.\r\nMy letters from America are none later than the 24th of April. The\r\ndisturbances in the Eastern States were entirely settled. I do not learn\r\nthat the government required any capital punishments. We promise ourselves\r\ngood from the Convention holding at Philadelphia. It consists of the\r\nablest men in America. It will surely be the instrument of referring to\r\nCongress the regulation of our trade. This may enable them to carry into\r\neffect a general impost which one or two obstinate States have so long\r\nprevented. Between six and seven hundred thousand acres of land are now\r\nsurveyed into townships, and will be immediately sold. The backwardness\r\nof the States to bring money into the public treasury has increased rather\r\nthan diminished. This has prevented the treasury board from remitting any\r\nmoney to this place for some time past, and Mr. Grand has given me notice\r\nthat their funds in his hands are exhausted, and himself considerably in\r\nadvance. This renders it necessary for us to suspend all draughts on him\r\nuntil he shall have received supplies from the Board of Treasury, to whom\r\nI write to press remittances. The moment we shall have wherewithal to\r\nanswer your accustomary draughts, I will exercise the pleasing office of\r\ngiving you notice of it. Indeed, I perceive by the papers that Mr. Adams\r\nis gone over to Holland. I am not without hopes that his object may be\r\nto procure supplies of money, and that your exertions joined with his may\r\ngive relief to us all. I have no answer from Congress on the subject which\r\nhas been thought of between us. I am afraid we may consider the refusal\r\nof the impost as an answer. I am exceedingly anxious to see the turn the\r\naffairs of your country may take. It will surely be seen soon whether\r\nfor the better or worse. I wish nothing may be gathering in the horizon\r\nto obscure the prospects of the patriotic party. My prayers for their\r\nprosperity are warm, as are the sentiments of personal esteem and respect\r\nwith which I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. BANNISTER, JUNIOR.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, June 19, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have received your favor of April the 23d, from New York, and\r\nam sorry to find you have had a relapse. Time and temperance, however,\r\nwill cure you; to which add exercise. I hope you have long ago had a\r\nhappy meeting with your friends, with whom a few hours would be to me an\r\nineffable feast. The face of Europe appears a little turbid, but all will\r\nsubside. The Empress endeavored to bully the Turk, who laughed at her,\r\nand she is going back. The Emperor's reformations have occasioned the\r\nappearance of insurrection in Flanders, and he, according to character,\r\nwill probably tread back his steps. A change of system here, with respect\r\nto the Dutch, is suspected; because the Kings of Prussia and England\r\nopenly espouse the cause of the Stadtholder, and that of the Patriots is\r\nlikely to fall. The American acquaintances whom you left here, not being\r\nstationary, you will hardly expect news of them. Mrs. Barrett, lately\r\ndead, was, I think, known to you. I had a letter from Ledyard lately,\r\ndated at St. Petersburg. He had but two shirts, and yet more shirts than\r\nshillings. Still he was determined to obtain the palm of being the first\r\ncircumambulator of the earth. He says, that having no money, they kick him\r\nfrom place to place, and thus he expects to be kicked round the globe. Are\r\nyou become a great walker? You know I preach up that kind of exercise.\r\nShall I send you a conte-pas? It will cost you a dozen louis, but be a\r\ngreat stimulus to walking, as it will record your steps. I finished my\r\ntour a week or ten days ago. I went as far as Turin, Milan, Genoa; and\r\nnever passed three months and a half more delightfully. I returned through\r\nthe canal of Languedoc, by Bordeaux, Nantes, L'Orient, and Rennes; then\r\nreturned to Nantes and came up the Loire to Orleans. I was alone through\r\nthe whole, and think one travels more usefully when alone, because he\r\nreflects more.\r\n\r\nPresent me in the most friendly terms to Mrs. Bannister, and to your\r\nfather, and be assured of the sincere esteem of, dear Sir, your friend and\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.[D]\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, June 20, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you last on the 30th of January, with a postscript of\r\nFebruary the 5th. Having set out the last day of that month to try the\r\nwaters of Aix, and been journeying since, till the 10th instant, I have\r\nbeen unable to continue my correspondence with you. In the meantime, I\r\nhave received your several favors of February the 16th, March the 18th\r\nand 19th, and April the 23d. The last arrived here about the 25th of May,\r\nwhile those of March the 18th and 19th, though written five weeks earlier,\r\narrived three weeks later. I mention this to show you how uncertain is the\r\nconveyance through England.\r\n\r\nThe idea of separating the executive business of the confederacy from\r\nCongress, as the judiciary is already, in some degree, is just and\r\nnecessary. I had frequently pressed on the members individually, while\r\nin Congress, the doing this by a resolution of Congress for appointing\r\nan executive committee, to act during the sessions of Congress, as\r\nthe committee of the States was to act during their vacations. But the\r\nreferring to this committee all executive business, as it should present\r\nitself, would require a more persevering self-denial than I suppose\r\nCongress to possess. It will be much better to make that separation by\r\na federal act. The negative, proposed to be given them on all the acts\r\nof the several legislatures, is now, for the first time, suggested to my\r\nmind. _Prima facie_, I do not like it. It fails in an essential character;\r\nthat the hole and the patch should be commensurate. But this proposes to\r\nmend a small hole by covering the whole garment. Not more than one out of\r\none hundred State acts concern the confederacy. This proposition, then, in\r\norder to give them one degree of power, which they ought to have, gives\r\nthem ninety-nine more, which they ought not to have, upon a presumption\r\nthat they will not exercise the ninety-nine. But upon every act, there\r\nwill be a preliminary question, Does this act concern the confederacy?\r\nAnd was there ever a proposition so plain, as to pass Congress without a\r\ndebate? Their decisions are almost always wise; they are like pure metal.\r\nBut you know of how much dross this is the result. Would not an appeal\r\nfrom the State judicature to a federal court, in all cases where the\r\nact of Confederation controlled the question, be as effectual a remedy,\r\nand exactly commensurate to the defect? A British creditor, for example,\r\nsues for his debt in Virginia; the defendant pleads an act of the State,\r\nexcluding him from their courts; the plaintiff urges the Confederation,\r\nand the treaty made under that, as controlling the State law; the judges\r\nare weak enough to decide according to the views of their legislature. An\r\nappeal to a federal court sets all to rights. It will be said, that this\r\ncourt may encroach on the jurisdiction of the State courts. It may. But\r\nthere will be a power, to wit, Congress, to watch and restrain them. But\r\nplace the same authority in Congress itself, and there will be no power\r\nabove them, to perform the same office. They will restrain within due\r\nbounds, a jurisdiction exercised by others, much more rigorously than if\r\nexercised by themselves.\r\n\r\nI am uneasy at seeing that the sale of our western lands is not yet\r\ncommenced. That valuable fund for the immediate extinction of our debt\r\nwill, I fear, be suffered to slip through our fingers. Every delay exposes\r\nit to events which no human foresight can guard against. When we consider\r\nthe temper of the people of that country, derived from the circumstances\r\nwhich surround them, we must suppose their separation possible, at every\r\nmoment. If they can be retained till their governments become settled\r\nand wise, they will remain with us always, and be a precious part of\r\nour strength and our virtue. But this affair of the Mississippi, by\r\nshowing that Congress is capable of hesitating on a question, which\r\nproposes a clear sacrifice of the western, to the maritime States, will\r\nwith difficulty be obliterated. The proposition of my going to Madrid,\r\nto try to recover there the ground which has been lost at New York, by\r\nthe concession of the vote of seven States, I should think desperate.\r\nWith respect to myself, weighing the pleasure of the journey and bare\r\npossibility of success, in one scale, and the strong probability of\r\nfailure and the public disappointment directed on me, in the other, the\r\nlatter preponderates. Add to this, that jealousy might be excited in the\r\nbreast of a person, who could find occasions of making me uneasy.\r\n\r\nThe late changes in the ministry here excite considerable hopes. I\r\nthink we gain in them all. I am particularly happy at the re-entry of\r\nMalesherbes into the Council. His knowledge and integrity render his value\r\ninappreciable, and the greater to me, because, while he had no views of\r\noffice, we had established together the most unreserved intimacy. So far,\r\ntoo, I am pleased with Montmorin. His honesty proceeds from the heart\r\nas well as the head, and therefore may be more surely counted on. The\r\nKing loves business, economy, order, and justice, and wishes sincerely\r\nthe good of his people; but he is irascible, rude, very limited in his\r\nunderstanding, and religious, bordering on bigotry. He has no mistress,\r\nloves his queen, and is too much governed by her. She is capricious like\r\nher brother, and governed by him; devoted to pleasure and expense; and\r\nnot remarkable for any other vices or virtues. Unhappily the King shows\r\na propensity for the pleasures of the table. That for drink has increased\r\nlately, or, at least, it has become more known.\r\n\r\nFor European news in general, I will refer you to my letter to Mr. Jay. Is\r\nit not possible, that the occurrences in Holland may excite a desire in\r\nmany, of leaving that country and transferring their effects out of it,\r\nand thus make an opening for shifting into their hands, the debts due to\r\nthis country, to its officers, and Farmers? It would be surely eligible.\r\nI believe Dumas, if put on the watch, might alone suffice; but he surely\r\nmight, if Mr. Adams should go when the moment offers. Dumas has been\r\nin the habit of sending his letters open to me, to be forwarded to Mr.\r\nJay. During my absence, they passed through Mr. Short's hands, who made\r\nextracts from them, by which I see he has been recommending himself and\r\nme for the money negotiations in Holland. It might be thought, perhaps,\r\nthat I have encouraged him in this. Be assured, my dear Sir, that no such\r\nidea ever entered my head. On the contrary, it is a business which would\r\nbe the most disagreeable to me of all others, and for which I am the\r\nmost unfit person living. I do not understand bargaining, nor possess the\r\ndexterity requisite for the purpose. On the other hand, Mr. Adams, whom\r\nI expressly and sincerely recommend, stands already on ground for that\r\nbusiness, which I could not gain in years. Pray set me to rights in the\r\nminds of those who may have supposed me privy to this proposition. _En\r\npassant_, I will observe with respect to Mr. Dumas, that the death of the\r\nCount de Vergennes places Congress more at their ease, how to dispose of\r\nhim. Our credit has been ill treated here in public debate, and our debt\r\nhere deemed apocryphal. We should try to transfer this debt elsewhere,\r\nand leave nothing capable of exciting ill thoughts between us. I shall\r\nmention in my letter to Mr. Jay, a disagreeable affair which Mr. Barclay\r\nhas been thrown into, at Bordeaux. An honester man cannot be found, nor a\r\nslower, nor more indecisive one. His affairs, too, are so embarrassed and\r\ndesperate, that the public reputation is, every moment, in danger of being\r\ncompromitted with him. He is perfectly amiable and honest, with all his\r\nembarassments.\r\n\r\nBy the next packet, I shall be able to send you some books, as also your\r\nwatch and pedometer. The two last are not yet done. To search for books,\r\nand forward them to Havre, will require more time than I had between\r\nmy return and the departure of this packet. Having been a witness,\r\nheretofore, to the divisions in Congress on the subject of their foreign\r\nministers, it would be a weakness in me to suppose none with respect to\r\nmyself, or to count with any confidence on the renewal of my commission,\r\nwhich expires on the 10th day of March next; and the more so, as instead\r\nof requiring the disapprobation of seven States, as formerly, that of\r\none suffices for a recall, when Congress consists of only seven States,\r\ntwo, when of eight, &c., which I suppose to be habitually their numbers\r\nat present. Whenever I leave this place, it will be necessary to begin\r\nmy arrangements six months before my departure; and these, once fairly\r\nbegun and under way, and my mind set homewards, a change of purpose could\r\nhardly take place. If it should be the desire of Congress that I should\r\ncontinue still longer, I could wish to know it, at farthest, by the packet\r\nwhich will sail from New York in September. Because, were I to put off\r\nlonger the quitting my house, selling my furniture, &c., I should not have\r\ntime left to wind up my affairs; and having once quitted, and sold off\r\nmy furniture, I could not think of establishing myself here again. I take\r\nthe liberty of mentioning this matter to you, not with a desire to change\r\nthe purpose of Congress, but to know it in time. I have never fixed in\r\nmy mind, the epoch of my return, so far as shall depend on myself, but I\r\nnever supposed it very distant. Probably I shall not risk a second vote on\r\nthis subject. Such trifling things may draw on me the displeasure of one\r\nor two States, and thus submit me to the disgrace of a recall.\r\n\r\nI thank you for the paccan nuts, which accompanied your letter of March.\r\nCould you procure me a copy of the bill for proportioning crimes and\r\npunishments, in the form in which it was ultimately rejected by the House\r\nof Delegates? Young Mr. Bannister desired me to send him regularly the\r\n_Mercure de France_. I will ask leave to do this through you, and that\r\nyou will adopt such method of forwarding them to him, as will save him\r\nfrom being submitted to postage, which they would not be worth. As a\r\ncompensation for your trouble, you will be free to keep them till you\r\nshall have read them. I am, with sentiments of the most sincere esteem,\r\ndear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n    [D] [Much of this letter is in cypher, but the notes annexed to it\r\n    have enabled the Editor to decipher and publish it.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, June 21, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I had the honor of addressing you in a letter of May the 4th, from\r\nMarseilles, which was to have gone by the last packet. But it arrived\r\na few hours too late for that conveyance, and has been committed to a\r\nprivate one, passing through England, with a promise that it should go\r\nthrough no post office.\r\n\r\nI was desirous, while at the seaports, to obtain a list of the American\r\nvessels which have come to them since the peace, in order to estimate\r\ntheir comparative importance to us, as well as the general amount of our\r\ncommerce with this country, so far as carried on in our own bottoms. At\r\nMarseilles, I found there had been thirty-two, since that period; at\r\nCette, not a single one; at Bayonne, one of our free ports, only one.\r\nThis last fact I learned from other information, not having visited that\r\nplace; as it would have been a deviation from my route, too considerable\r\nfor the importance of the object. At Bordeaux, Nantes, and L'Orient, I\r\ncould not obtain lists in the moment; but am in hopes I shall be able to\r\nget them ere long. Though more important to us, they will probably be more\r\nimperfect than that of Marseilles. At Nantes, I began with Monsieur Dobrée\r\nan arrangement of his claims. I visited the military stores, which have\r\nbeen detained there so long, opened some boxes of each kind, and found the\r\nstate of their contents much better than had been represented. An exact\r\nlist of the articles is to be sent me.\r\n\r\nThe importations into L'Orient of other fish oils, besides those of the\r\nwhale, brought to my notice there a defect in the letter of Monsieur de\r\nCalonnes, of October the 22d, which letter was formerly communicated to\r\nyou. In that, _whale_ oil only was named. The other fish oils, therefore,\r\nhave continued to pay the old duties. In a conference with Monsieur de\r\nVilledeuil, the present Comptroller General, since my return, I proposed\r\nthe extending the exemption to all _fish oils_, according to the letter\r\nof the Hanseatic treaty, which had formed the basis of the regulations\r\nrespecting us. I think this will be agreed to. The delays of office\r\nfirst, then the illness of Monsieur de Calonnes, and lastly, his removal\r\nand the throng of business occasioned by the Assemblée des Notables,\r\nhave prevented the reducing the substance of the letter into the form\r\nof an _Arret_, as yet; though I have continued soliciting it as much\r\nas circumstances would bear. I am now promised that it shall be done\r\nimmediately, and that it shall be so far retrospective to the date of the\r\nletter, as that all duties paid since that, shall be refunded.\r\n\r\nThe new accessions to the ministry are valued here. Good is hoped from the\r\nArchbishop of Toulouse, who succeeds the Count de Vergennes as _Chef du\r\nConseil de finance_. Monsieur de Villedeuil, the Comptroller General, has\r\nbeen approved by the public, in the offices he has heretofore exercised.\r\nThe Duke de Nivernois, called to the Council, is reckoned a good and\r\nable man; and Monsieur de Malesherbes, called also to the Council,\r\nis unquestionably the first character in the kingdom, for integrity,\r\npatriotism, knowledge, and experience in business. There is a fear that\r\nthe Marechal de Castries is disposed to retire.\r\n\r\nThe face of things in Europe is a little turbid at present; but probably\r\nall will subside. The Empress of Russia, it is supposed, will not push her\r\npretensions against the Turks to actual war. Weighing the fondness of the\r\nEmperor for innovation, against his want of perseverance, it is difficult\r\nto calculate what he will do with his discontented subjects in Brabant\r\nand Flanders. If those provinces alone were concerned, he would probably\r\ngive back; but this would induce an opposition to his plan, in all his\r\nother dominions. Perhaps he may be able to find a compromise. The cause\r\nof the Patriots in Holland is a little clouded at present. England and\r\nPrussia seem disposed to interpose effectually. The former has actually\r\nordered a fleet of six sail of the line, northwardly, under Gore; and the\r\nlatter threatens to put her troops into motion. The danger of losing such\r\na weight in their scale, as that of Prussia, would occasion this court to\r\nprefer conciliation to war. Add to this the distress of their finances,\r\nand perhaps not so warm a zeal in the new ministry for the innovations\r\nin Holland. I hardly believe they will think it worth while to purchase\r\nthe change of constitution proposed there, at the expense of a war. But\r\nof these things you will receive more particular and more certain details\r\nfrom Mr. Dumas, to whom they belong.\r\n\r\nMr. Eden is appointed Ambassador from England to Madrid. To the hatred\r\nborne us by his court and country, is added a recollection of the\r\ncircumstances of the unsuccessful embassy to America, of which he made a\r\npart. So that I think he will carry to Madrid dispositions to do us all\r\nthe ill he can.\r\n\r\nThe late change in the ministry is very favorable to the prospects of the\r\nChevalier de La Luzerne. The Count de Montmorin, Monsieur de Malesherbes,\r\nand Monsieur de Lamoignon, the Garde des Sceaux, are his near relations.\r\nProbably something will be done for him, and without delay. The promise\r\nof the former administration to the Count de Moutier, to succeed to this\r\nvacancy, should it take place, will perhaps be performed by the present\r\none.\r\n\r\nMr. Barclay has probably informed you of his having been arrested in\r\nBordeaux, for a debt contracted in the way of his commerce. He immediately\r\napplied to the parliament of that place, who ordered his discharge. This\r\ntook place after five days' actual imprisonment. I arrived at Bordeaux\r\na few days after his liberation. As the Procureur General of the King\r\nhad interested himself to obtain it, with uncommon zeal, and that too on\r\npublic principles, I thought it my duty to wait on him and return him my\r\nthanks. I did the same to the president of the parliament, for the body\r\nover which he presided; what would have been an insult in America, being\r\nan indispensable duty here. You will see by the enclosed printed paper, on\r\nwhat grounds the Procureur insisted on Mr. Barclay's liberation. Those on\r\nwhich the parliament ordered it, are not expressed. On my arrival here, I\r\nspoke with the minister on that subject. He observed, that the character\r\nof consul is no protection in this country against process for debt;\r\nthat as to the character with which Mr. Barclay had been invested at the\r\ncourt of Morocco, it was questionable whether it would be placed on the\r\ndiplomatic line, as it had not been derived immediately from Congress;\r\nthat, if it were, it would have covered him to Paris only, where he had\r\nreceived his commission, had he proceeded directly thither, but that\r\nhis long stay at Bordeaux must be considered as terminating it there. I\r\nobserved to him, that Mr. Barclay had been arrested almost immediately\r\non his arrival at Bordeaux. But, says he, the arrest was made void by\r\nthe parliament, and still he has continued there several weeks. True, I\r\nreplied, but his adversaries declared they would arrest him again, the\r\nmoment he should go out of the jurisdiction of the parliament of Bordeaux,\r\nand have actually engaged the Maréechaussée on the road, to do it. This\r\nseemed to impress him. He said he could obtain a letter of safe conduct\r\nwhich would protect him to Paris, but that, immediately on his arrival\r\nhere, he would be liable to arrest. I asked him if such a letter could not\r\nbe obtained to protect him to Paris, and back to Bordeaux, and even to\r\nAmerica? He said, that for that, the consent of the greater part of his\r\ncreditors would be necessary; and even with this, it was very doubtful\r\nwhether it could be obtained; still if I would furnish him with that\r\nconsent, he would do what should depend on him. I am persuaded he will,\r\nand have written to Mr. Barclay to obtain the consent of his creditors.\r\nThis is the footing on which this matter stands at present. I have stated\r\nit thus particularly, that you may know the truth, which will probably\r\nbe misrepresented in the English papers, to the prejudice of Mr. Barclay.\r\nThis matter has been a great affliction to him, but no dishonor where its\r\ntrue state is known. Indeed he is incapable of doing anything not strictly\r\nhonorable.\r\n\r\nIn a letter of August the 30th, 1785, I had the honor of mentioning to you\r\nwhat had passed here, on the subject of a convention for the regulation\r\nof the two post offices. I now enclose you a letter from the Baron\r\nD'Ogny, who is at the head of that department, which shows that he still\r\nexpects some arrangement. I have heard it said, that M. de Creve-coeur\r\nis authorized to treat on this subject. You doubtless know if this be\r\ntrue. The articles may certainly be better adjusted there, than here. This\r\nletter from the Baron D'Ogny was in consequence of an application from a\r\nservant of mine, during my absence, which would not have been made had I\r\nbeen here. Nor will it be repeated; it being my opinion and practice to\r\npay small sums of money, rather than to risk favors.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to enclose you also, copies of a letter and papers from\r\nthe Marechal de Castries, on the claim of an individual against the State\r\nof South Carolina, for services performed on board the Indian; and the\r\npetition of another, on a like claim; also copies of letters received\r\nfrom O'Bryan at Algiers, and from Mr. Lambe. A letter of the 26th of May,\r\nfrom Mr. Montgomery, at Alicant, informs me, that by a vessel arrived\r\nat Carthagena from Algiers, they learn the death of the Dey of that\r\nrepublic. Yet, as we hear nothing of it through any other channel, it\r\nmay be doubted. It escaped me at the time of my departure to Aix, to make\r\narrangements for sending you the gazettes regularly, by the packets. The\r\nwhole are now sent, though a great part of them are so old as to be not\r\nworth perusal. Your favor of April the 24th has been duly received. I have\r\nthe honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and respect,\r\nSir, your most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MADAME DE CORNY.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, June 30, 1787.\r\n\r\nOn my return to Paris, it was among my first intentions to go to the\r\nrue Chaussée d'Antin, No. 17, and inquire after my friends whom I\r\nhad left there. I was told they were in England. And how do you like\r\nEngland, Madam? I know your taste for the works of art gives you a little\r\ndisposition to Anglomania. Their mechanics certainly exceed all others\r\nin some lines. But be just to your own nation. They have not patience,\r\nit is true, to set rubbing a piece of steel from morning till night, as a\r\nlethargic Englishman will do, full charged with porter. But do not their\r\nbenevolence, their cheerfulness, their amiability, when compared with the\r\ngrowling temper and manners of the people among whom you are, compensate\r\ntheir want of patience? I am in hopes that when the splendor of their\r\nshops, which is all that is worth looking at in London, shall have lost\r\ntheir charm of novelty, you will turn a wistful eye to the people of\r\nParis, and find that you cannot be so happy with any others. The Bois de\r\nBoulogne invites you earnestly to come and survey its beautiful verdure,\r\nto retire to its umbrage from the heats of the season. I was through it\r\nto-day, as I am every day. Every tree charged me with this invitation\r\nto you. Passing by la Muette, it wished for you as a mistress. You want\r\na country house. This is for sale; and in the Bois de Boulogne, which\r\nI have always insisted to be most worthy of your preference. Come then,\r\nand buy it. If I had had confidence in your speedy return, I should have\r\nembarrassed you in earnest with my little daughter. But an impatience\r\nto have her with me, after her separation from her friends, added to a\r\nrespect for your ease, has induced me to send a servant for her.\r\n\r\nI tell you no news, because you have correspondents infinitely more _au\r\nfait_ of the details of Paris than I am. And I offer you no services,\r\nbecause I hope you will come as soon as the letter could, which should\r\ncommand them. Be assured, however, that nobody is more disposed to render\r\nthem, nor entertains for you a more sincere and respectful attachment,\r\nthan him who, after charging you with his compliments to Monsieur de\r\nCorny, has the honor of offering you the homage of those sentiments of\r\ndistinguished esteem and regard, with which he is, dear Madam, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                       PARIS, July 1, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I returned about three weeks ago from a very useless voyage;\r\nuseless, I mean, as to the object which first suggested it, that of\r\ntrying the effect of the mineral waters of Aix, in Provence, on my hand.\r\nI tried these, because recommended among six or eight others as equally\r\nbeneficial, and because they would place me at the beginning of a tour\r\nto the seaports of Marseilles, Bordeaux, Nantes and L'Orient, which I\r\nhad long meditated, in hopes that a knowledge of the places and persons\r\nconcerned in our commerce, and the information to be got from them, might\r\nenable me sometimes to be useful. I had expected to satisfy myself, at\r\nMarseilles, of the causes of the difference of quality between the rice\r\nof Carolina, and that of Piedmont, which is brought in quantities to\r\nMarseilles. Not being able to do it, I made an excursion of three weeks\r\ninto the rice country beyond the Alps, going through it from Vercelli\r\nto Pavia, about sixty miles. I found the difference to be, not in the\r\nmanagement, as had been supposed both here and in Carolina, but in the\r\nspecies of rice; and I hope to enable them in Carolina, to begin the\r\ncultivation of the Piedmont rice, and carry it on, hand in hand, with\r\ntheir own, that they may supply both qualities; which is absolutely\r\nnecessary at this market. I had before endeavored to lead the depôt of\r\nrice from Cowes to Honfleur, and hope to get it received there on such\r\nterms, as may draw that branch of commerce from England to this country.\r\nIt is an object of two hundred and fifty thousand guineas a year. While\r\npassing through the towns of Turin, Milan and Genoa, I satisfied myself\r\nof the practicability of introducing our whale oil for their consumption,\r\nand suppose it would be equally so, in the other great cities of that\r\ncountry. I was sorry that I was not authorized to set the matter on foot.\r\nThe merchants with whom I chose to ask conferences, met me freely, and\r\ncommunicated fully, knowing I was in a public character. I could, however,\r\nonly prepare a disposition to meet our oil merchants. On the article of\r\ntobacco, I was more in possession of my ground; and put matters into a\r\ntrain for inducing their government to draw their tobaccos directly from\r\nthe United States, and not, as heretofore, from Great Britain. I am now\r\noccupied with the new ministry here, to put the concluding hand to the new\r\nregulations for our commerce with this country, announced in the letter\r\nof Monsieur de Calonnes, which I sent you last fall. I am in hopes, in\r\naddition to those, to obtain a suppression of the duties on tar, pitch\r\nand turpentine, and an extension of the privileges of American _whale_\r\noil, to their _fish_ oils in general. I find that the quantity of cod-fish\r\noil brought to L'Orient, is considerable. This being got off hand (which\r\nwill be in a few days) the chicaneries and vexations of the Farmers on\r\nthe article of tobacco, and their elusions of the order of Bernis, call\r\nfor the next attention. I have reasons to hope good dispositions in the\r\nnew ministry towards our commerce with this country. Besides endeavoring,\r\non all occasions, to multiply the points of contact and connection with\r\nthis country, which I consider as our surest mainstay under every event,\r\nI have had it much at heart to remove from between us every subject of\r\nmisunderstanding or irritation. Our debts to the King, to the Officers,\r\nand the Farmers, are of this description. The having complied with no\r\npart of our engagements in these, draws on us a great deal of censure,\r\nand occasioned a language in the Assemblée des Notables, very likely to\r\nproduce dissatisfaction between us. Dumas being on the spot in Holland,\r\nI had asked of him sometime ago, in confidence, his opinion of the\r\npracticability of transferring these debts from France to Holland, and\r\ncommunicated his answer to Congress, pressing them to get you to go\r\nover to Holland, and try to effect this business. Your knowledge of the\r\nground, and former successes, occasioned me to take this liberty without\r\nconsulting you because I was sure you would not weigh your personal\r\ntrouble against public good. I have had no answer from Congress; but\r\nhearing of your journey to Holland, have hoped that some money operations\r\nhad led you there. If it related to the debts of this country, I would\r\nask a communication of what you think yourself at liberty to communicate,\r\nas it might change the form of my answers to the eternal applications I\r\nreceive. The debt to the officers of France carries an interest of about\r\ntwo thousand guineas, so we may suppose its principal is between thirty\r\nand forty thousand. This makes more noise against us, than all our other\r\ndebts put together.\r\n\r\nI send you the _Arrets_ which begin the reformation here, and some\r\nother publications respecting America; together with copies of letters\r\nreceived from O'Bryan and Lambe. It is believed that a naval armament has\r\nbeen ordered at Brest, in correspondence with that of England. We know,\r\ncertainly, that orders are given to form a camp in the neighborhood of\r\nBrabant, and that Count Rochambeau has the command of it. Its amount, I\r\ncannot assert. Report says fifteen thousand men. This will derange the\r\nplans of economy. I take the liberty of putting under your cover, a letter\r\nfor Mrs. Kinloch, of South Carolina, with a packet, and will trouble\r\nyou to inquire for her, and have them delivered. The packet is of great\r\nconsequence, and therefore referred to her care, as she will know the safe\r\nopportunities of conveying it. Should you not be able to find her, and can\r\nforward the packet to its address, by any very safe conveyance, I will beg\r\nyou to do it. I have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect\r\nfriendship and esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DAVID HARTLEY.\r\n\r\n                                                       PARIS, July 2, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received lately your favor of April the 23d, on my return\r\nfrom a journey of three or four months; and am always happy in an occasion\r\nof recalling myself to your memory. The most interesting intelligence from\r\nAmerica, is that respecting the late insurrection in Massachusetts. The\r\ncause of this has not been developed to me, to my perfect satisfaction.\r\nThe most probable is, that those individuals were of the imprudent number\r\nof those, who have involved themselves in debt beyond their abilities\r\nto pay, and that a vigorous effort in that government to compel the\r\npayment of private debts, and raise money for public ones, produced\r\nthe resistance. I believe you may be assured, that an idea or desire\r\nof returning to anything like their ancient government, never entered\r\ninto their heads. I am not discouraged by this. For thus I calculate.\r\nAn insurrection in one of thirteen States, in the course of eleven years\r\nthat they have subsisted, amounts to one in any particular State, in one\r\nhundred and forty-three years, say a century and a half. This would not\r\nbe near as many, as have happened in every other government that has ever\r\nexisted. So that we shall have the difference between a light and a heavy\r\ngovernment, as clear gain. I have no fear, but that the result of our\r\nexperiment will be, that men may be trusted to govern themselves without\r\na master. Could the contrary of this be proved, I should conclude, either\r\nthat there is no God, or that he is a malevolent being. You have heard\r\nof the federal convention, now sitting at Philadelphia, for the amendment\r\nof the Confederation. Eleven States appointed delegates certainly; it was\r\nexpected that Connecticut would also appoint, the moment its Assembly met.\r\nRhode Island had refused. I expect they will propose several amendments;\r\nthat that relative to our commerce will probably be adopted immediately,\r\nbut that the others must wait to be adopted one after another, in\r\nproportion as the minds of the States ripen for them. Dr. Franklin\r\nenjoys good health. I shall always be happy to hear from you, being\r\nwith sentiments of very sincere esteem and respect, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO B. VAUGHAN.\r\n\r\n                                                       PARIS, July 2, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of February the 16th, came to my hands in the moment\r\nI was setting out on a tour through the southern parts of France and\r\nnorthern of Italy, from which I am but just now returned. I avail myself\r\nof the earliest moment to acknowledge its receipt, and to thank you for\r\nthe box of magnets which I found here. Though I do not know certainly,\r\nby, or from whom they come, I presume they came by Colonel Smith, who\r\nwas here in my absence, and from Messrs. Nairne and Blunt, through your\r\ngood offices. I think your letter of February the 16th, flatters me\r\nwith the expectation of another, with observations, on the hygrometers\r\nI had proposed. I value what comes from you too much, not to remind\r\nyou of it. Your favor by Mr. Garnett also, came during my absence. I\r\npresume he has left Paris, as I can hear nothing of him. I have lost the\r\nopportunity, therefore, of seeing his method of resisting friction, as\r\nwell as of showing, by attentions to him, respect for yourself and your\r\nrecommendations. Mr. Paine (Common Sense) is here on his way to England.\r\nHe has brought the model of an iron bridge, with which he supposes a\r\nsingle arch of four hundred feet, may be made. It has not yet arrived in\r\nParis. Among other projects, with which we begin to abound in America,\r\nis one for finding the latitude by the variation of the magnetic needle.\r\nThe author supposes two points, one near each pole, through the northern\r\nof which, pass all the magnetic meridians of the northern hemisphere, and\r\nthrough the southern, those of the southern hemisphere. He determines\r\ntheir present position and periodical revolution. It is said, his\r\npublication is plausible. I have not seen it.\r\n\r\nWhat are you going to do with your naval armament on your side the\r\nchannel? Perhaps you will ask me, what they are about to do here? A\r\nBritish navy and Prussian army hanging over Holland on one side, a French\r\nnavy and army hanging over it on the other, looks as if they thought of\r\nfighting. Yet I think both parties too wise for that, too laudably intent\r\non economizing, rather than on further embarrassing their finances. May\r\nthey not propose to have a force on the spot, to establish some neutral\r\nform of a constitution, which these powers will cook up among themselves,\r\nwithout consulting the parties for whom it is intended? The affair of\r\nGeneva shows such combinations possible. Wretched, indeed, is the nation\r\nin whose affairs foreign powers are once permitted to intermeddle. Lord\r\nWycombe is with us at present. His good sense, information and discretion,\r\nare much beyond his years, and promise good things for your country.\r\n\r\nI beg you to accept assurances of the esteem and respect with which I have\r\nthe honor to be, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. GORDON.\r\n\r\n                                                       PARIS, July 2, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Being just returned from a tour through the southern parts of\r\nFrance and northern of Italy, I could not till this moment, acknowledge\r\nthe receipt of your obliging letter with the papers accompanying it.\r\nIt happened unluckily also that those addressed to the Marquis de La\r\nFayette, were under my cover. I put them into his hands the moment of my\r\nreturn. From the opportunities you have had of coming at facts known as\r\nyet to no other historian, from your dispositions to relate them fairly,\r\nand from your known talents, I have sanguine expectations that your work\r\nwill be a valuable addition to historical science; and the more so, as\r\nwe have little yet on the subject of our war, which merits respect. I\r\nfear, however, that this is not the field from which you are to expect\r\nprofit. The translation will sell here; but few read English. Be assured,\r\nthat nothing shall be wanting on my part to encourage a preference of\r\nthe original to a translation; but it will not be till the fall that\r\neither will be called for, because, during summer, the readers are in the\r\ncountry. I got from a bookseller here about forty guineas for a first copy\r\nof Dr. Ramsay's work, which he had translated. If this would be an object\r\nwith you, I offer you my service. I have the honor to be, with sentiments\r\nof great esteem, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO T. B. HOLLIS, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                       PARIS, July 2, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--On my return from a tour through the southern parts of France and\r\nnorthern of Italy, I found here the present of books you had been so kind\r\nas to send me. I should value them highly for their intrinsic merit, but\r\nmuch more as coming from you. You will have seen that one of our republics\r\nhas experienced those commotions which the newspapers have been always\r\nascribing to all of them. I am not satisfied what has been the cause of\r\nthis, but the most probable account is, that these individuals were of\r\nthose who have so imprudently involved themselves in debt; and that a\r\nvigorous exertion in their government to enforce the payment of private\r\ndebts, and raise money for the public ones, occasioned the insurrection.\r\nOne insurrection in thirteen States in the course of eleven years\r\nthat they have existed, amounts to one in any individual State in one\r\nhundred and forty-three years, say a century and a half. This will not\r\nweigh against the inconveniences of a government of force, such as are\r\nmonarchies and aristocracies. You see I am not discouraged by this little\r\ndifficulty; nor have I any doubt that the result of our experiment will\r\nbe, that men are capable of governing themselves without a master. I have\r\nthe honor to be, with sentiments of the highest esteem and respect, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BONDFIELD.\r\n\r\n                                                       PARIS, July 2, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Revising the letters and notes in my possession on the subject\r\nof our commerce, I observe you say in your letter of December 12, that\r\nwe pay alien duties in the ports of France, supposed the double of what\r\nwe ought to pay. If by this you mean that we are not on as favorable a\r\nfooting as Spain, it would be vain to remonstrate on that subject. The\r\nfamily compact expressly excluded all other nations from the advantages\r\nthe two parties ceded to each other; but if there be any other nation\r\nwhich enjoys any greater advantages in the ports of France than we do,\r\nI should wish to know it, because, if it be not in consequence of a\r\nparticular compensation, I should hope to remove it. Will you be so good\r\nas to explain the matter? and shall I ask the further favor of you to\r\nforward the enclosed letter by the first vessel going from your port to\r\nVirginia. I wish to hear from Mr. Barclay, who, I suppose, is still with\r\nyou, and whose service and comfort I have sincerely at heart. I am, with\r\nmuch esteem and respect, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. JAMES MANNY.\r\n\r\n                                                       PARIS, July 2, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The reason why the receipt of your favor of May 21, has been\r\nthus unacknowledged, was my absence on a tour round the sea-port towns,\r\nfrom which I am just returned. In the meantime, the occasion of your\r\ninquiry relative to Mr. Morris' bills has passed; nor could I now explain\r\nthe reason of their protest. I understand, however, that they are since\r\nhonored. The effect, therefore, will only be to show that there is a limit\r\neven to his credit.\r\n\r\nRecent appearances in Europe would seem to threaten war. On one side,\r\nEngland sending a navy of observation to hover over Holland, and Prussia\r\nan army; this country sending a navy and army to hover over the other side\r\nof the same country; yet it is morally sure that all these powers desire\r\npeace most ardently. It remains to see, then, whether they mean any more\r\nthan to arrange a kind of constitution which shall be merely neutral, and\r\nto force it on the United Netherlands, as done in the case of Geneva. I\r\nneed not write you American news. You have it of later date than I have. I\r\nshall, therefore, only add assurances of the esteem and respect with which\r\nI am, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. L'ABBE MORELLET.\r\n\r\n                                                       PARIS, July 2, 1787.\r\n\r\nI am sorry, my dear Sir, that your interest should be affected by the\r\nill behavior of Barrois; but when you consider the facts, you will be\r\nsensible that I could not have indulged his indolence further without\r\nincreasing the injury to a more punctual workman. Stockdale, of London,\r\nhad asked leave to print my Notes. I agreed to it, and promised he should\r\nhave the plate of the map as soon as it should be corrected, and the\r\ncopies struck off for you and myself. He thereupon printed his edition\r\ncompletely in three weeks. The printer, who was to strike off two hundred\r\nand fifty maps for me, kept the plate but five days. It was then delivered\r\nto Barrois, with notice that it could not be left longer with him than\r\nshould suffice to strike off his number. Repeated applications for it\r\nby Mr. Short and my servant were only answered by repeated promises and\r\ntimes of delivery fixed, no one of which was performed. When I returned,\r\nhe had been possessed of the plate upwards of two months. I was astonished\r\nand confounded to be told it had not been sent to Stockdale, and that his\r\nedition had been lying dead on his hands three months. I sent to Barrois\r\nthe very day of my return, to let him know, that justice to Stockdale\r\ndid not permit me to defer sending him the plate any longer, yet I would\r\nwait five days, at the end of which he must deliver me the plate, whether\r\nhis maps were done or not. I received no answer, but waited ten days. I\r\nthen sent for the plate. The answer was, he was not at home. I sent again\r\nthe next day. Answer, he was not at home. I sent the third day. Not at\r\nhome. I then ordered the messenger to go back, and wait till he should\r\ncome home. This produced an answer of two lines, _qu'il alloit soigner\r\nson ouvrier_? I wrote him word in return to deliver the plate instantly.\r\nThis I think was on Saturday or Sunday. He told the messenger he would\r\nlet me have it the Thursday following. I took patience, and sent on the\r\nFriday, but telling the messenger if he refused to deliver it, to inform\r\nhim I would be plagued no more with sending messages, but apply to the\r\npolice. He then delivered it, and I sent it off immediately to London.\r\nHe had kept it three months, of which three weeks were after my return.\r\nI think, Sir, you will be satisfied that justice to Stockdale, justice to\r\nmyself who had passed my word for sending on the plate, and sensibility to\r\nthe shuffling conduct of Barrois, permitted me to act no otherwise. But\r\nno matter. Let his ill behavior make no odds between you and me. It will\r\naffect your interest, and that suffices to determine me to order back the\r\nplate as soon as Stockdale has done with it. He will not require more days\r\nthan Barrois months, so that it will be here before you can want it. But\r\nit must never go into Barrois' hands again, nor of any person depending\r\non him, or under his orders. The workman who struck off the two hundred\r\nand fifty for me seems to have been diligent enough. Either he, or any\r\nother workman you please of that description, shall have it to strike\r\nwhat number you wish. I forgot to observe, in its proper place, that when\r\nI was in the midst of my difficulties, I did myself the honor of calling\r\non you, as well to have that of asking after your health on my return as\r\nof asking your assistance to obtain the plate. Unluckily you were gone\r\nto Versailles, so I was obliged to proceed as well as I could. It is no\r\nexcuse for Barrois to say he could not get his Imprimeur to proceed. He\r\nshould have applied to another. But as to you, it shall be set to rights\r\nin the manner I have before stated. Accept my regret that you were in\r\nthe hands of so undeserving a workman, and one who placed me under the\r\nnecessity of interrupting a work which interested you. Be assured, at\r\nthe same time, of the sincerity of those sentiments of esteem and respect\r\nwith which I have the honor to be, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_The following observations appear to have been addressed to the\r\n          Count de Montmorin, about the 6th of July, 1787._]\r\n\r\nObservations on the letter of Monsieur de Calonnes to Monsieur Jefferson,\r\ndated Fontainebleau, October 22, 1786.\r\n\r\nA committee was appointed, in the course of the last year, to take a\r\nview of the subjects of commerce which might be brought from the United\r\nStates of America, in exchange for those of France, and to consider what\r\nadvantages and facilities might be offered to encourage that commerce.\r\nThe letter of Monsieur de Calonnes was founded on their report. It was\r\nconclusive as to the articles on which satisfactory information had been\r\nthen obtained, and reserved, for future consideration, certain others,\r\nneeding further inquiry. It is proposed now to review those unfinished\r\narticles, that they may also be comprehended in the _Arret_, and the\r\nregulations on this branch of commerce, be rendered complete.\r\n\r\n1. The letter promised to diminish the \"Droits du Roi et d'amirauté,\"\r\npayable by an American vessel entering into a port of France, and to\r\nreduce what should remain into a single duty, which shall be regulated by\r\nthe draught of the vessel, or her number of masts. It is doubted whether\r\nit will be expedient to regulate the duty in either of these ways. If by\r\nthe draught of water, it will fall unequally on us as a nation; because\r\nwe build our vessels sharp-bottomed, for swift sailing, so that they draw\r\nmore water than those of other nations, of the same burthen. If by the\r\nnumber of masts, it will fall unequally on individuals; because we often\r\nsee ships of one hundred and eighty tons, and brigs of three hundred\r\nand sixty. This, then, would produce an inequality among individuals, of\r\nsix to one. The present principle is the most just, to regulate by the\r\nburthen. It is certainly desirable, that these duties should be reduced to\r\na single one. Their names and numbers perplex and harass the merchant more\r\nthan their amount; subject him to imposition, and to the suspicion of it\r\nwhen there is none. An intention of general reformation in this article,\r\nhas been accordingly announced, with augmentation as to foreigners. We\r\nare in hopes, that this augmentation is not to respect us; because it is\r\nproposed as a measure of reciprocity, whereas, in some of our States, no\r\nsuch duties exist, and in the others, they are extremely light; because\r\nwe have been made to hope a diminution, instead of augmentation; and\r\nbecause this distinction cannot draw on France any just claims from other\r\nnations; the _Jura gentis amicissimæ_, conferred by her late treaties,\r\nhaving reference expressly to the nations of Europe only; and those\r\nconferred by the more ancient ones, not being susceptible of any other\r\ninterpretation, nor admitting a pretension of reference to a nation which\r\ndid not then exist, and which has come into existence under circumstances,\r\ndistinguishing its commerce from that of all other nations. Merchandize\r\nreceived from them, takes employment from the poor of France; ours gives\r\nit; theirs is brought in the last stage of manufacture; ours in the first;\r\nwe bring our tobaccos to be manufactured into snuff, our flax and hemp\r\ninto linen and cordage, our furs into hats, skins into saddlery, shoes and\r\nclothing; we take nothing till it has received the last hand.\r\n\r\n2. Fish oils. The Hanseatic treaty was the basis on which the diminution\r\nof duty on this article was asked and granted. It is expressly referred to\r\nas such, in the letter of Monsieur de Calonnes. Instead, however, of the\r\nexpression, \"huile et graisse de baleine et d'autres poissons,\" used in\r\nthat treaty, the letter uses the terms, \"huiles de baleine, spermaceti,\r\net tout ce qui est compris sous ces denominations.\" And the Farmers have\r\navailed themselves of this variation, to refuse the diminution of duty on\r\nthe oils of the _vache marine_, _chein de mer_, _esturgeon_, and other\r\nfish. It is proposed, therefore, to re-establish in the _Arret_, the\r\nexpression of the Hanseatic treaty, and to add, from the same treaty, the\r\narticles \"baleine coupée et fanon de baleine.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter states these regulations as finally made by the King. The\r\nmerchants, on this supposition, entered into speculations. But they found\r\nthemselves called on for the old duties, not only on other fish oils, but\r\non the whale oil. Monsieur de Calonnes always promised that the _Arret_\r\nshould be retrospective to the date of the letter, so as to refund to\r\nthem the duties they had thus been obliged to pay. To this, attention\r\nis prayed in forming the _Arret_. His majesty having been pleased, as an\r\nencouragement to the importation of our fish oils, to abolish the _Droits\r\nde fabrication_, it is presumed that the purpose announced, of continuing\r\nthose duties on foreign oils, will not be extended to us.\r\n\r\n3. Rice. The duty on this is only seven and a half deniers the quintal,\r\nor about one-quarter per cent. on its first cost. While this serves to\r\ninform a government of the quantities imported, it cannot discourage that\r\nimportation. Nothing further, therefore, is necessary on this article.\r\n\r\n4. Pot-asse. This article is of principal utility to France, in her\r\nbleacheries of linen, glass works, and soap works; and the potash of\r\nAmerica, being made of green wood, is known to be the best in the world.\r\nAll duty on it was therefore abolished by the King. But the city of Rouen\r\nlevies on it a duty of twenty sols the quintal, which is very sensible\r\nin its price, brings it dearer to the bleacheries near Paris, to those\r\nof Beauvais, Laval, &c., and to the glass works, and encourages them\r\nto give a preference to the potash or soude of other nations. This is a\r\ncounteraction of the views of the King, expressed in the letter, which it\r\nis hoped will be prevented.\r\n\r\n5. Turpentine, tar and pitch, were not decided on, on the former occasion.\r\nTurpentine (_terebenthine_) pays ten sols the quintal, and ten sols the\r\nlivre, making fifteen sols the quintal; which is ten per cent. on its\r\nprime cost. Tar (_goudron brai gras_) pays eight livres the _leth_ of\r\ntwelve barrels, and ten sols the livre, amounting to twenty sols the\r\nbarrel; which is twelve and a half per cent. on its prime cost. Pitch\r\n(_brai sec_) pays ten sols the quintal, and ten sols the livre, making\r\nfifteen sols the quintal; which is twenty per cent. on its prime cost.\r\nDuties of from ten to twenty per cent. on articles of heavy carriage,\r\nprevent their importation. They eat up all the profits of the merchant,\r\nand often subject him to loss. This has been much the case with respect to\r\nturpentine, tar and pitch, which are principal articles of remittance for\r\nthe State of North Carolina. It is hoped, that it will coincide with the\r\nviews of government, in making the present regulations, to suppress the\r\nduties on these articles, which, of all others, can bear them best.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO T. M. RANDOLPH, JUNIOR.\r\n\r\n                                                       PARIS, July 6, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of April the 14th, came here during my absence on\r\na journey through the southern parts of France and northern of Italy,\r\nfrom which I am but lately returned. This cause alone has prevented your\r\nreceiving a more early answer to it. I am glad to find, that among the\r\nvarious branches of science presenting themselves to your mind, you have\r\nfixed on that of politics as your principal pursuit. Your country will\r\nderive from this a more immediate and sensible benefit. She has much\r\nfor you to do. For, though we may say with confidence, that the worst\r\nof the American constitutions is better than the best which ever existed\r\nbefore, in any other country, and that they are wonderfully perfect for\r\na first essay, yet every human essay must have defects. It will remain,\r\ntherefore, to those now coming on the stage of public affairs, to perfect\r\nwhat has been so well begun by those going off it. Mathematics, Natural\r\nPhilosophy, Natural History, Anatomy, Chemistry, Botany, will become\r\namusements for your hours of relaxation, and auxiliaries to your principal\r\nstudies. Precious and delightful ones they will be. As soon as such a\r\nfoundation is laid in them, as you may build on as you please, hereafter,\r\nI suppose you will proceed to your main objects, Politics, Law, Rhetoric,\r\nand History. As to these, the place where you study them is absolutely\r\nindifferent. I should except Rhetoric, a very essential member of them,\r\nand which I suppose must be taught to advantage where you are. You would\r\ndo well, therefore, to attend the public exercises in this branch also,\r\nand to do it with very particular diligence. This being done, the question\r\narises, where you shall fix yourself for studying Politics, Law, and\r\nHistory? I should not hesitate to decide in favor of France, because\r\nyou will, at the same time, be learning to speak the language of that\r\ncountry, become absolutely essential under our present circumstances. The\r\nbest method of doing this, would be to fix yourself in some family where\r\nthere are women and children, in Passey, Auteuil, or some other of the\r\nlittle towns in reach of Paris. The principal hours of the day, you will\r\nattend to your studies, and in those of relaxation, associate with the\r\nfamily. You will learn to speak better from women and children in three\r\nmonths, than from men in a year. Such a situation, too, will render more\r\neasy a due attention to economy of time and money. Having pursued your\r\nmain studies here, about two years, and acquired a facility in speaking\r\nFrench, take a tour of four or five months through this country and Italy,\r\nreturn then to Virginia, and pass a year in Williamsburg, under the care\r\nof Mr. Wythe; and you will be ready to enter on the public stage, with\r\nsuperior advantages. I have proposed to you, to carry on the study of\r\nthe law with that of politics and history. Every political measure will,\r\nforever, have an intimate connection with the laws of the land; and he,\r\nwho knows nothing of these, will always be perplexed, and often foiled\r\nby adversaries having the advantage of that knowledge over him. Besides,\r\nit is a source of infinite comfort to reflect, that under every chance\r\nof fortune, we have a resource in ourselves from which we may be able to\r\nderive an honorable subsistence. I would, therefore, propose not only the\r\nstudy, but the practice of the law for some time, to possess yourself of\r\nthe habit of public speaking. With respect to modern languages, French,\r\nas I have before observed, is indispensable. Next to this, the Spanish\r\nis most important to an American. Our connection with Spain is already\r\nimportant, and will become daily more so. Besides this, the ancient\r\npart of American history is written chiefly in Spanish. To a person who\r\nwould make a point of reading and speaking French and Spanish, I should\r\ndoubt the utility of learning Italian. These three languages, being all\r\ndegeneracies from the Latin, resemble one another so much, that I doubt\r\nthe probability of keeping in the head a distinct knowledge of them\r\nall. I suppose that he who learns them all, will speak a compound of the\r\nthree, and neither perfectly. The journey which I propose to you need not\r\nbe expensive, and would be very useful. With your talents and industry,\r\nwith science, and that steadfast honesty which eternally pursues right,\r\nregardless of consequences, you may promise yourself everything--but\r\nhealth, without which there is no happiness. An attention to health, then,\r\nshould take place of every other object. The time necessary to secure this\r\nby active exercises, should be devoted to it, in preference to every other\r\npursuit. I know the difficulty with which a studious man tears himself\r\nfrom his studies, at any given moment of the day. But his happiness, and\r\nthat of his family, depend on it. The most uninformed mind, with a healthy\r\nbody, is happier than the wisest valetudinarian. I need not tell you, that\r\nif I can be useful to you in any part of this, or any other plan you shall\r\nadopt, you will make me happy by commanding my services.\r\n\r\nWill you be so good, Sir, as to return my most respectful thanks for\r\nthe diploma with which I am honored by the society instituted with you,\r\nfor the encouragement of the study of Natural History? I am afraid it\r\nwill never be in my power to contribute anything to the object of the\r\ninstitution. Circumstances have thrown me into a very different line of\r\nlife, and not choice, as I am happy to find in your case. In the year\r\n1781, while confined to my room by a fall from my horse, I wrote some\r\nNotes, in answer to the inquiries of M. de Marbois, as to the natural and\r\npolitical state of Virginia. They were hasty and undigested; yet as some\r\nof these touch slightly on some objects of its natural history, I will\r\ntake the liberty of asking the society to accept a copy of them. For the\r\nsame reason, and because too, they touch on the political condition of our\r\ncountry, I will beg leave to present you with a copy, and ask the favor\r\nof you to find a conveyance for them from London to Edinburgh. They are\r\nprinted by Stockdale, bookseller, Piccadilly, and will be ready in three\r\nor four weeks from this time. I will direct him to deliver two copies to\r\nyour order.\r\n\r\nRepeating, constantly, the proffer of my services, I shall only add\r\nassurances of the esteem and attachment with which I am, dear Sir, your\r\nfriend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. RUTLEDGE, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, July 14, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received your favor of the 14th of October in the moment\r\nI was setting out on a tour of the sea-port towns of this country, from\r\nwhich I have been not long returned. I received it, too, with that kind\r\nof heartfelt pleasure which always attends the recollection of ancient\r\naffections. I was glad to find that the adaptation of your rice to this\r\nmarket was considered worth attention, as I had supposed it. I set out\r\nfrom hence impressed with the idea the rice-dealers here had given me,\r\nthat the difference between your rice and that of Piedmont proceeded\r\nfrom a difference in the machine for cleaning it. At Marseilles I hoped\r\nto know what the Piedmont machine was; but I could find nobody who\r\nknew anything of it. I determined, therefore, to sift the matter to the\r\nbottom, by crossing the Alps into the rice country. I found their machine\r\nexactly such a one as you had described to me in Congress in the year\r\n1783. There was but one conclusion then to be drawn, to wit, that the\r\nrice was of a different species, and I determined to take enough to put\r\nyou in seed; they informed me, however, that its exportation in the husk\r\nwas prohibited, so I could only bring off as much as my coat and surtout\r\npockets would hold. I took measures with a muleteer to run a couple of\r\nsacks across the Apennines to Genoa, but have not great dependence on its\r\nsuccess. The little, therefore, which I brought myself, must be relied\r\non for fear we should get no more; and because, also, it is genuine from\r\nVercilli, where the best is made of all the Sardinian Lombardy, the whole\r\nof which is considered as producing a better rice than the Milanese. This\r\nis assigned as the reason for the strict prohibition. Piedmont rice sold\r\nat Nice, (the port of its exportation,) when I was there, at seventeen\r\nlivres French, the French hundred weight. It varies from time to time as\r\nthe price of wheat does with us. The price of Carolina rice at Bordeaux,\r\nNantes, L'Orient and Havre, varies from sixteen florins to twenty-four\r\nflorins the French quintal, which is equal to one hundred and nine pounds\r\nour weight. The best ports to send it to are Bordeaux and Havre, (or\r\nRouen, which is the same thing as Havre,) but it is essential that it\r\narrive here a month before the commencement of Lent, when the principal\r\ndemand is made for it. Carolina rice, after being sorted here into several\r\nqualities, sells from six sols to ten sols the French pound, retail,\r\naccording to the quality. Unsorted and wholesale about thirty florins\r\nthe French quintal. Piedmont rice is of but one quality, which sells at\r\nretail at ten sous the French pound, and wholesale is about three or four\r\nlivres dearer than yours. In order to induce your countrymen to ship their\r\nrice here directly, I have proposed to some merchants here to receive\r\nconsignments, allowing the consigner to draw in the moment of shipping\r\nfor as much as he could sell on the spot, and the balance when it should\r\nbe sold. But they say this is impossible. They are to consider and inform\r\nme what are the most favorable terms on which they can receive it. I am\r\ntold that freight, insurance, and commission are about four livres the\r\nFrench quintal to a sea-port town. I have written so long a letter on the\r\nsubject of rice to Mr. Drayton for the Society of Agriculture, that I will\r\ntrouble you with no further particulars, but refer you to that. Indeed,\r\nI am sensible I have written too much on the subject. Being absolutely\r\nignorant of it myself, it was impossible for me to know what particulars\r\nmerited communication. I thought it best, therefore, to communicate\r\neverything. After writing that letter, I received one from Mr. Izard,\r\nby which I found that he had examined the rice-process in Lombardy. He\r\nwas so much more capable than myself of giving the details, that I had\r\nat one moment determined to suppress my letter. However, observing that\r\nhe considered the rice at Piedmont to be of the same species with yours,\r\nand suspecting myself certainly that it is not, I determined to hazard my\r\nletter and all those criticisms which fall justly on an ignorant person\r\nwriting on a subject to those much more learned in it than himself. A part\r\nof my letter, too, related to the olive tree and caper, the first of which\r\nwould surely succeed in your country, and would be an infinite blessing\r\nafter some fifteen or twenty years. The caper would also probably succeed,\r\nand would offer a very great and immediate profit. I thank you for your\r\nobliging mention of my worthless notes on Virginia. Worthless and bad as\r\nthey are, they have been rendered more so, as I am told, by a translation\r\ninto French. That I may have neither merit or demerit not my own, I have\r\nconsented to their publication in England. I advised the bookseller to\r\nsend two hundred copies to Philadelphia, and two hundred to Richmond,\r\nsupposing that number might be sold in the United States; but I do not\r\nknow whether he will do it. If you will give me leave, I will send you a\r\ncopy of the original impression. I congratulate you, my dear friend, on\r\nthe law of your State, for suspending the importation of slaves, and for\r\nthe glory you have justly acquired by endeavoring to prevent it forever.\r\nThis abomination must have an end. And there is a superior bench reserved\r\nin heaven for those who hasten it. The distractions of Holland thicken\r\napace. They begin to cut one another's throats heartily. I apprehend the\r\nneighboring powers will interfere; but it is not yet clear whether in\r\nconcert or by taking opposite sides. It is a poor contest, whether they\r\nshall have one, or many masters. Your nephew is arrived here in good\r\nhealth. My first interview with him has impressed me much in his favor.\r\nPresent me very respectfully to Mrs. Rutledge, as well as to your brother\r\nand his house. Accept yourself assurances of the sincere esteem and\r\nrespect with which I am, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY MR. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, July 17, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have been duly honored with yours of the 10th instant, and\r\nam happy to hear of the success of your journey to Amsterdam. There can\r\nbe no doubt of its ratification by Congress. Would to heaven they would\r\nauthorize you to take measures for transferring the debt of this country\r\nto Holland, before you leave Europe. Most especially is it necessary to\r\nget rid of the debt to the officers. Their connections at Court are such\r\nas to excite very unfavorable feelings there against us, and some very\r\nhard things have been said (particularly in the Assemblée des Notables)\r\non the prospect relative to our debts. The payment of the interest to\r\nthe officers would have kept them quiet; but there are two years now\r\ndue to them. I dare not draw for it without instructions, because in\r\nthe instances in which I have hitherto ventured to act uninstructed,\r\nI have never been able to know whether they have been approved in the\r\nprivate sentiments of the members of Congress, much less by any vote.\r\nI have pressed on them the expediency of transferring the French debts\r\nto Holland, in order to remove everything which may excite irritations\r\nbetween us and this nation. I wish it may be done before this ministry may\r\nreceive ill impressions of us. They are at present very well disposed. I\r\nsend you by Mr. Appleton some pamphlets, and have the honor to be, with\r\nsentiments of very cordial esteem, your affectionate and humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. JOSEPH FENWICK.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, July 21, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am this moment honored with your letter of the 16th, and wish\r\nit was in my power to give you the information desired on the subject of\r\ntobaccos. The complaint has been universal that the Farmers General have\r\nnot complied with the order of government. I have, therefore, desired\r\nthat they may be called on to report precisely what tobacco they have\r\npurchased on the terms prescribed by the order, that if it shall appear\r\nthey have not bought the whole quantity, they may be compelled to do it\r\nimmediately. It is impossible to foresee whether any new regulations will\r\nbe made to take place on the expiration of the contract of Mr. Morris.\r\nI shall certainly press for something to be done by way of antidote to\r\nthe monopoly under which this article is placed in France. The moment\r\nanything is decided which may be interesting to our commerce, I shall take\r\ngreat care to communicate it to them through Mr. Bondfield; though I do\r\nnot expect anything interesting to take place very soon. I am, with much\r\nregard, Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO STEPHEN CATHALAN, JUNIOR.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, July 21, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I received your favor of May the 9th just as I was stepping into the\r\nbarge on my departure from Cette; which prevented my answering it from\r\nthat place. On my arrival here, I thought I would avail myself of the\r\nopportunity of paying your balance, to make a little acquaintance with\r\nSir John Lambert. One or two unsuccessful attempts to find him at home,\r\nwith the intermediate procrastinations well known to men of business,\r\nprevented my seeing him till yesterday, and have led me on to this moment,\r\nthrough a perpetual remorse of conscience for not writing to you, and to\r\nthe constant belief that it would be to-morrow and to-morrow. At length, I\r\nhave seen him, paid him the eighty-five livres which you have been so kind\r\nas to advance for me, and am actually at my writing-table, returning you\r\nthanks for this kindness, and to yourself and the family for the thousand\r\nothers I received at their hands, at Marseilles. My journey, after leaving\r\nyou, wanted nothing but the company of Madame Cathalan and yourself, to\r\nrender it perfectly agreeable. I felt the want of it peculiarly on the\r\nCanal de Languedoc, where, with society, the mode of travelling would have\r\nbeen charming. I was much indebted to M. Minaudier for a good equipment\r\nfrom Agde, and unceasing attentions to that place; for which I was\r\nindebted to your recommendations as well as to his goodness.\r\n\r\nI am honored with your father's letter of June the 30th; and, as he does\r\nnot read English, and I cannot write French, I must beg leave to answer\r\nhim through you. I thank him for his hints on the subject of tobacco. I\r\nam now pressing for arrangements as to that article, to take place on the\r\nexpiration of Mr. Morris' contract, and the order of Bernis. What form\r\nthis business will take, or what will be the nature of the arrangements,\r\nor whether there will be any, I am as yet unable to say. I will take care\r\nto inform you the moment there is a decision.\r\n\r\nThe public business with which Mr. Barclay has been charged rendering\r\nit necessary for him to repair to Congress, and the interest of his\r\ncreditors, his family and himself requiring his return to America, he\r\nhas departed for that country. I know nothing of Mr. Barclay's affairs in\r\nthis country. He has good possessions in America, which, he assured me,\r\nwere much more than sufficient to satisfy all the demands against him. He\r\nwent, determined to convert those immediately into money, and to collect\r\nthe debts due to him there, that he might be enabled to pay his debts. My\r\nopinion of his integrity is such, as to leave no doubt in my mind, that he\r\nwill do everything in his power to render justice to his creditors, and I\r\nknow so well his attachment to M. Cathalan, as to be satisfied, that if\r\nhe makes any difference among his creditors, he will be among the most\r\nfavored. Mr. Barclay is an honest and honorable man, and is more goaded\r\ntowards the payment of his debts by his own feelings, than by all the\r\nprocesses of law which could be set on foot against him.\r\n\r\nNo arrangements having ever been made as yet, for cases like that of\r\nthe carpenter of the American ship Sally, I am unable to answer on that\r\nsubject. I am in hopes, his money will last till he recovers his senses,\r\nor till we can receive instructions what to do in that and similar cases.\r\n\r\nMr. Cathalan wishes a copy of my Notes on Virginia. If you will be so good\r\nas to advise me by what channel they will go safely, I will do myself the\r\nhonor of sending a copy, either of the original or of the translation.\r\nPresent me affectionately to Mrs. Cathalan, the mother and daughter; tell\r\nthe latter I feed on the hopes of seeing her one day at Paris. My friendly\r\nrespects wait also on your father; and on yourself, assurances of the\r\nesteem and consideration with which I have the honor to be, dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE DELEGATES OF RHODE ISLAND.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, July 22, 1787.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--I was honored, in the month of January last, with a letter\r\nfrom the honorable the Delegates of Rhode Island in Congress, enclosing a\r\nletter from the corporation of Rhode Island College to his most Christian\r\nMajesty, and some other papers. I was then in the hurry of preparation for\r\na journey into the South of France, and therefore unable, at that moment,\r\nto make the inquiries which the object of the letter rendered necessary.\r\nAs soon as I returned, which was in the last month, I turned my attention\r\nto that object, which was the establishment of a professorship of the\r\nFrench language in the College, and the obtaining a collection of the\r\nbest French authors, with the aid of the King. That neither the College\r\nnor myself might be compromitted uselessly, I thought it necessary to\r\nsound, previously, those who were able to inform me what would be the\r\nsuccess of the application. I was assured, so as to leave no doubt, that\r\nit would not be complied with; that there had never been an instance of\r\nthe King's granting such a demand in a foreign country, and that they\r\nwould be cautious of setting the precedent: that, in this moment, too,\r\nthey were embarrassed with the difficult operation of putting down all\r\nestablishments of their own, which could possibly be dispensed with, in\r\norder to bring their expenditures down to the level of their receipts.\r\nUpon such information I was satisfied, that it was most prudent not\r\nto deliver the letter, and spare to both parties the disagreeableness\r\nof giving and receiving a denial. The King did give to two colleges in\r\nAmerica copies of the works printing in the public press. But were this\r\nto be obtained for the College of Rhode Island, it would extend only\r\nto a volume or two of Buffon's works, still to be printed, Manilius'\r\nAstronomicon, and one or two other works in the press, which are of no\r\nconsequence. I did not think this an object for the College, worth being\r\npressed. I beg the favor of you, gentlemen, to assure the corporation,\r\nthat no endeavors of mine should have been spared, could they have\r\neffected their wish; and that they have been faithfully used in making the\r\npreliminary enquiries which are necessary, and which ended in an assurance\r\nthat nothing could be done. These papers having been transmitted to me\r\nthrough your delegation, will, I hope, be an apology for my availing\r\nmyself of the same channel, for communicating the result.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Gentlemen, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE MONTMORIN.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, July 23, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I had the honor, a few days ago, of putting into the hands of your\r\nExcellency, some observations on the other articles of American produce,\r\nbrought into the ports of this country. That of our tobaccos, from the\r\nparticular form of their administration here, and their importance to\r\nthe King's revenues, has been placed on a separate line, and considered\r\nseparately. I will now ask permission to bring that subject under your\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe mutual extension of their commerce was among the fairest advantages\r\nto be derived to France and the United States, from the independence of\r\nthe latter. An exportation of eighty millions, chiefly in raw materials,\r\nis supposed to constitute the present limits of the commerce of the United\r\nStates with the nations of Europe; limits, however, which extend as their\r\npopulation increases. To draw the best proportion of this into the ports\r\nof France, rather than of any other nation, is believed to be the wish\r\nand interest of both. Of these eighty millions, thirty are constituted by\r\nthe single article of tobacco. Could the whole of this be brought into\r\nthe ports of France, to satisfy its own demands, and the residue to be\r\nre-vended to other nations, it would be a powerful link of commercial\r\nconnection. But we are far from this. Even her own consumption, supposed\r\nto be nine millions, under the administration of the monopoly to which it\r\nis farmed, enters little, as an article of exchange, into the commerce of\r\nthe two nations. When this article was first put into Farm, perhaps it did\r\nnot injure the commercial interests of the kingdom; because nothing but\r\nBritish manufactures were then allowed to be given in return for American\r\ntobaccos. The laying the trade open, then, to all the subjects of France,\r\ncould not have relieved her from a payment in money. Circumstances are\r\nchanged; yet the old institution remains. The body to which this monopoly\r\nwas given, was not mercantile. Their object is to simplify as much as\r\npossible, the administration of their affairs. They sell for cash; they\r\npurchase, therefore, with cash. Their interest, their principles and\r\ntheir practice, seem opposed to the general interest of the kingdom,\r\nwhich would require, that this capital article should be laid open to a\r\nfree exchange for the productions of this country. So far does the spirit\r\nof simplifying their operations govern this body, that relinquishing the\r\nadvantages to be derived from a competition of sellers, they contracted\r\nsome time ago with a single person (Mr. Morris), for three years' supplies\r\nof American tobacco, to be paid for in cash. They obliged themselves too,\r\nexpressly, to employ no other person to purchase in America, during that\r\nterm. In consequence of this, the mercantile houses of France, concerned\r\nin sending her productions to be exchanged for tobacco, cut off, for\r\nthree years, from the hope of selling these tobaccos in France, were of\r\nnecessity to abandon that commerce. In consequence of this, too, a single\r\nindividual, constituted sole purchaser of so great a proportion of the\r\ntobaccos made, had the price in his own power. A great reduction in it\r\ntook place, and that, not only on the quantity he bought, but on the\r\nwhole quantity made. The loss to the States producing the article, did\r\nnot go to cheapen it for their friends here. Their price was fixed. What\r\nwas gained on their consumption, was to enrich the person purchasing it;\r\nthe rest, the monopolists and merchants of other countries. The effect\r\nof this operation was vitally felt by every farmer in America, concerned\r\nin the culture of this plant. At the end of the year, he found he had\r\nlost a fourth or a third of his revenue; the State, the same proportion\r\nof its subjects of exchange with other nations: the manufactures of\r\nthis country, too, were either not to go there at all, or go through the\r\nchannel of a new monopoly, which, freed from the control of competition\r\nin prices and qualities, was not likely to extend their consumption. It\r\nbecame necessary to relieve the two countries from the fatal effects of\r\nthis double monopoly. I had the honor of addressing a letter, on the 15th\r\nday of August, 1785, to his late excellency, the Count de Vergennes, upon\r\nthis subject, a copy of which I do myself the honor herein to enclose.\r\nThe effectual mode of relief was to lay the commerce open. But the King's\r\ninterest was also to be guarded. A committee was appointed to take this\r\nmatter into consideration; and the result was, an order to the Farmers\r\nGeneral, that no such contract should be made again. And to furnish such\r\naliment as might keep that branch of commerce alive, till the expiration\r\nof the present contract, they were required to put the merchants in\r\ngeneral, on a level with Mr. Morris, for the quantity of twelve or\r\nfifteen thousand hogsheads a year. That this relief, too, might not be\r\nintercepted from the merchants of the two suffering nations by those of a\r\nneighboring one, and that the transportation of so bulky an article might\r\ngo to nourish their own shipping, no tobaccos were to be counted of this\r\npurchase, but those brought in French or American vessels. Of this order,\r\nmade at Bernis, his Excellency, Count de Vergennes, was pleased to honor\r\nme with a communication, by a letter of the 30th of May, 1786, desiring\r\nthat I would publish it as well in America, as to the American merchants\r\nin France. I did so; communicating it to Congress at the same time. This\r\norder, thus viewed with the transactions which produced it, will be seen\r\nto have been necessary; and its punctual and candid execution has been\r\nrendered still more so, by the speculations of the merchants, entered into\r\non the faith of it. Otherwise, it would become the instrument of their\r\nruin instead of their relief. A twelve month has elapsed some time since;\r\nand it is questioned whether the Farmers General have purchased, within\r\nthat time, the quantity prescribed, and on the conditions prescribed.\r\nIt would be impossible for the merchants to prove the negative; it will\r\nbe easy for the Farmers General to show the affirmative, if it exists. I\r\nhope that a branch of commerce of this extent will be thought interesting\r\nenough to both nations, to render it the desire of your Excellency to\r\nrequire, as I deem it my duty to ask, a report of the purchases they have\r\nmade, according to the conditions of the order of Bernis, specifying, in\r\nthat report, 1, the quantities purchased; 2, the prices paid; 3, the dates\r\nof the purchase and payment; 4, the flag of the vessel in which imported;\r\n5, her name; 6, her port of delivery; and 7, the name of the seller. The\r\nfour first articles make part of the conditions required by the order of\r\nBernis; the three last may be necessary for the correction of any errors\r\nwhich should happen to arise in the report.\r\n\r\nBut the order of Bernis was never considered but as a temporary relief.\r\nThe radical evil will still remain. There will be but one purchaser in\r\nthe kingdom, and the hazard of his refusal will damp every mercantile\r\nspeculation. It is very much to be desired, that before the expiration\r\nof this order, some measure may be devised, which may bring this great\r\narticle into free commerce between the two nations. Had this been\r\npracticable at the time it was put into Farm, that mode of collecting\r\nthe revenue would probably never have been adopted; now that it has\r\nbecome practicable, it seems reasonable to discontinue this mode, and to\r\nsubstitute some of those practised on other imported articles, on which\r\na revenue is levied, without absolutely suppressing them in commerce.\r\nIf the revenue can be secured, the interests of a few individuals will\r\nhardly be permitted to weigh against those of as many millions, equally\r\nsubjects of his Majesty, and against those, too, of a nation allied to him\r\nby all the ties of treaty, of interest and of affection. The privileges\r\nof the most favored nation, have been mutually exchanged by treaty. But\r\nthe productions of other nations, which do not rival those of France, are\r\nsuffered to be bought and sold freely within the kingdom. By prohibiting\r\nall his Majesty's subjects from dealing in tobacco, except with a single\r\ncompany, one third of the exports of the United States are rendered\r\nuncommerciable here. This production is so peculiarly theirs, that its\r\nshackles affect no other nation. A relief from these shackles, will form a\r\nmemorable epoch in the commerce of the two nations. It will establish at\r\nonce a great basis of exchange, serving like a point of union to draw to\r\nit other members of our commerce. Nature too, has conveniently assorted\r\nour wants and our superfluities, to each other. Each nation has exactly\r\nto spare, the articles which the other wants. We have a surplus of rice,\r\ntobacco, furs, peltry, potash, lamp oils, timber, which France wants; she\r\nhas a surplus of wines, brandies, esculent oils, fruits and manufactures\r\nof all kinds, which we want. The governments have nothing to do, but _not\r\nto hinder_ their merchants from making the exchange. The difference of\r\nlanguage, laws and customs, will be some obstacle for a time; but the\r\ninterest of the merchants will surmount them. A more serious obstacle is\r\nour debt to Great Britain. Yet, since the treaty between this country\r\nand that, I should not despair of seeing that debt paid, in part, with\r\nthe productions of France, if our produce can obtain here, a free course\r\nof exchange for them. The distant prospect is still more promising. A\r\ncentury's experience has shown, that we double our numbers every twenty\r\nor twenty-five years. No circumstance can be foreseen, at this moment,\r\nwhich will lessen our rate of multiplication for centuries to come. For\r\nevery article of the productions and manufactures of this country, then,\r\nwhich can be introduced into the habit there, the demand will double every\r\ntwenty or twenty-five years. And to introduce the habit, we have only to\r\nlet the merchants alone. Whether we may descend, by a single step, from\r\nthe present state, to that of perfect freedom of commerce in this article,\r\nwhether any, and what, intermediate operation may be necessary to prepare\r\nthe way to this, what cautions must be observed for the security of his\r\nMajesty's revenue, which we do not wish to impair, will rest with the\r\nwisdom of his ministers, whose knowledge of the subject will enable them\r\nto devise the best plans, and whose patriotism and justice will dispose\r\nthem to pursue them. To the friendly dispositions of your Excellency, of\r\nwhich we have had such early and multiplied proofs, I take the liberty of\r\ncommitting this subject, particularly trusting that some method may be\r\ndevised, of reconciling the collection of his Majesty's revenues, with\r\nthe interests of the two nations; and have the honor of assuring you,\r\nof those sincere sentiments of esteem and respect, with which I am your\r\nExcellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SKIPWITH.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, July 28, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--A long journey has prevented me from writing to any of my\r\nfriends, for some time past. This was undertaken with a view to benefit a\r\ndislocated and ill-set wrist, by the mineral waters of Aix, in Provence.\r\nFinding this hope vain, I was led from other views to cross the Alps as\r\nfar as Turin, Milan, Genoa; to follow the Mediterranean as far as Cette,\r\nthe canal of Languedoc, the Garonne, &c., to Paris. A most pleasing\r\njourney it proved; arts and agriculture offering something new at every\r\nstep, and often things worth our imitation. But the accounts from our\r\ncountry give me to believe that we are not in a condition to hope for the\r\nimitation of anything good. All my letters are filled with details of our\r\nextravagance. From these accounts, I look back to the time of the war as a\r\ntime of happiness and enjoyment, when amidst the privation of many things\r\nnot essential to happiness, we could not run in debt, because nobody would\r\ntrust us; when we practised by necessity the maxim of buying nothing but\r\nwhat we had money in our pockets to pay for; a maxim which, of all others,\r\nlays the broadest foundation for happiness. I see no remedy to our evils,\r\nbut an open course of law. Harsh as it may seem, it would relieve the\r\nvery patients who dread it, by stopping the course of their extravagance,\r\nbefore it renders their affairs entirely desperate. The eternal and bitter\r\nstrictures on our conduct which teem in every London paper, and are copied\r\nfrom them into others, fill me with anxiety on this subject. The state\r\nof things in Europe is rather threatening at this moment. The innovations\r\nof the Emperor in his dominions have excited a spirit of resistance. His\r\nsubjects in Brabant and Flanders are arming, and he has put forty-five\r\nthousand troops in motion towards that country. I believe they will come\r\nto blows. The parties in Holland have already spilt too much blood to be\r\neasily stopped. If left to themselves, I apprehend the Stadtholderians\r\nwill be too strong; and if foreign powers interfere, the weight is still\r\non their side. England and Prussia will be too much for France. As it is\r\ncertain that neither of these powers wish for war, and that England and\r\nFrance are particularly averse to it, perhaps the matter may end in an\r\narmed mediation. If the mediators should not agree, they will draw their\r\nnegotiations into length, and trust to the chapter of accidents for their\r\nfinal solution. With respect to our country, it stands well with the\r\npresent ministry here. The non-payment of our debt is against us. We are\r\noccupied in procuring favorable terms of reception for our produce.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear Sir, and be assured of the sentiments of sincere esteem of\r\nyour affectionate friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. W. EPPES.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, July 28, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR JACK,--The letter which you were so kind as to write to me the 22d of\r\nMay, 1786, was not delivered to me till the 3d of May, 1787, when it found\r\nme in the neighborhood of Marseilles. Before that time, you must have\r\ntaken your degree, as mentioned in your letter. Those public testimonies\r\nwhich are earned by merit, and not by solicitation, may always be accepted\r\nwithout the imputation of vanity. Of this nature is the degree which your\r\nmasters proposed to confer on you. I congratulate you sincerely on it. It\r\nwill be a pleasing event to yourself; it will be the same to your parents\r\nand friends, and to none more than myself. Go on deserving applause, and\r\nyou will be sure to meet with it; and the way to deserve it is, to be\r\ngood, and to be industrious. I am sure you will be good, and hope you\r\nwill be industrious. As to your future plan, I am too distant from you to\r\nadvise you on sure grounds. In general, I am of opinion, that till the age\r\nof about sixteen, we are best employed on languages; Latin, Greek, French,\r\nand Spanish, or such of them as we can. After this, I think the College of\r\nWilliam and Mary the best place to go through the courses of Mathematics,\r\nNatural Philosophy in its different branches, and Law. Of the languages I\r\nhave mentioned, I think Greek the least useful. Write me word, from time\r\nto time, how you go on. I shall always be glad to assist you with any\r\nbooks you may have occasion for, and you may count with certainty on every\r\nservice I can ever render you, as well as on the sincere esteem of, dear\r\nJack, yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A. DONALD.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, July 28, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received with infinite satisfaction your letter of the 1st\r\nof March; it was the first information I had of your being in America.\r\nThere is no person whom I shall see again with more cordial joy, whenever\r\nit shall be my lot to return to my native country; nor any one whose\r\nprosperity in the mean-time will be more interesting to me. I find, as\r\nI grow older, that I set a higher value on the intimacies of my youth,\r\nand am more afflicted by whatever loses one of them to me. Should it be\r\nin my power to render any service in your shipment of tobacco to Havre\r\nde Grace, I shall do it with great pleasure. The order of Bernis has,\r\nI believe, been evaded by the Farmers General as much as possible. At\r\nthis moment, I receive information from most of the seaports, that they\r\nrefuse taking any tobacco, under the pretext that they have purchased\r\ntheir whole quantity. From Havre I have heard nothing, and believe you\r\nwill stand a better chance there than anywhere else. Being one of the\r\nports of manufacture, too, it is entitled to a higher price. I have now\r\ndesired, that the Farmers may make a distinct return of their purchases,\r\nwhich are conformable to the order of Bernis. If they have really bought\r\ntheir quantity, _on those terms_, we must be satisfied; if they have not,\r\nI shall propose their being obliged to make it up instantly. There is a\r\nconsiderable accumulation of tobacco in the ports.\r\n\r\nAmong many good qualities which my countrymen possess, some of a different\r\ncharacter unhappily mix themselves. The most remarkable are, indolence,\r\nextravagance, and infidelity to their engagements. Cure the two first, and\r\nthe last would disappear, because it is a consequence of them, and not\r\nproceeding from a want of morals. I know of no remedy against indolence\r\nand extravagance, but a free course of justice. Everything else is merely\r\npalliative; but unhappily, the evil has gained too generally the mass\r\nof the nation, to leave the course of justice unobstructed. The maxim\r\nof buying nothing without the money in our pockets to pay for it, would\r\nmake of our country one of the happiest upon earth. Experience during\r\nthe war proved this; as I think every man will remember, that under all\r\nthe privations it obliged him to submit to, during that period, he slept\r\nsounder, and awaked happier than he can do now. Desperate of finding\r\nrelief from a free course of justice, I look forward to the abolition\r\nof all credit, as the only other remedy which can take place. I have\r\nseen, therefore, with pleasure, the exaggerations of our want of faith,\r\nwith which the London papers teem. It is, indeed, a strong medicine for\r\nsensible minds, but it is a medicine. It will prevent their crediting\r\nus abroad, in which case we cannot be credited at home. I have been much\r\nconcerned at the losses produced by the fire of Richmond. I hope you have\r\nescaped them. It will give me much pleasure to hear from you, as often as\r\nyou can spare a moment to write. Be assured that nobody entertains for you\r\nsentiments of more perfect and sincere esteem than, dear Sir, your friend\r\nand servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM DRAYTON.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, July 30, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Having observed that the consumption of rice in this country,\r\nand particularly in this capital, was very great, I thought it my duty\r\nto inform myself from what markets they draw their supplies, in what\r\nproportion from ours, and whether it might not be practicable to increase\r\nthat proportion. This city being little concerned in foreign commerce,\r\nit is difficult to obtain information on particular branches of it in\r\nthe detail. I addressed myself to the retailers of rice, and from them\r\nreceived a mixture of truth and error, which I was unable to sift apart\r\nin the first moment. Continuing, however, my inquiries, they produced at\r\nlength this result: that the dealers here were in the habit of selling\r\ntwo qualities of rice, that of Carolina, with which they were supplied\r\nchiefly from England, and that of Piedmont; that the Carolina rice was\r\nlong, slender, white and transparent, answers well when prepared with\r\nmilk, sugar, &c., but not so well when prepared _au gras_; that that of\r\nPiedmont was shorter, thicker, and less white, but that it presented its\r\nform better when dressed _au gras_, was better tasted, and therefore\r\npreferred by good judges for those purposes; that the consumption of\r\nrice, in this form, was much the most considerable, but that the superior\r\nbeauty of the Carolina rice, seducing the eye of those purchasers who\r\nare attached to appearances, the demand for it was upon the whole as\r\ngreat as for that of Piedmont. They supposed this difference of quality\r\nto proceed from a difference of management; that the Carolina rice was\r\nhusked with an instrument that broke it more, and that less pains were\r\ntaken to separate the broken from the unbroken grains, imagining that\r\nit was the broken grains which dissolved in oily preparations; that the\r\nCarolina rice costs somewhat less than that of Piedmont; but that being\r\nobliged to sort the whole grains from the broken, in order to satisfy\r\nthe taste of their customers, they ask and receive as much for the first\r\nquality of Carolina, when sorted, as for the rice of Piedmont; but the\r\nsecond and third qualities, obtained by sorting, are sold much cheaper.\r\nThe objection to the Carolina rice then, being, that it crumbles in\r\ncertain forms of preparation, and this supposed to be the effect of a\r\nless perfect machine for husking, I flattered myself I should be able\r\nto learn what might be the machine of Piedmont, when I should arrive at\r\nMarseilles, to which place I was to go in the course of a tour through\r\nthe seaport towns of this country. At Marseilles, however, they differed\r\nas much in account of the machines, as at Paris they had differed about\r\nother circumstances. Some said it was husked between mill-stones, others\r\nbetween rubbers of wood in the form of mill-stones, others of cork. They\r\nconcurred in one fact, however, that the machine might be seen by me,\r\nimmediately on crossing the Alps. This would be an affair of three weeks.\r\nI crossed them and went through the rice country from Vercelli to Pavia,\r\nabout sixty miles. I found the machine to be absolutely the same with that\r\nused in Carolina, as well as I could recollect a description which Mr. E.\r\nRutledge had given me of it. It is on the plan of a powder mill. In some\r\nof them, indeed, they arm each pestle with an iron tooth, consisting of\r\nnine spikes hooked together, which I do not remember in the description\r\nof Mr. Rutledge. I therefore had a tooth made, which I have the honor\r\nof forwarding you with this letter; observing, at the same time, that\r\nas many of their machines are without teeth as with them, and of course,\r\nthat the advantage is not very palpable. It seems to follow, then, that\r\nthe rice of Lombardy (for though called Piedmont rice, it does not grow\r\nin that county but in Lombardy) is of a different species from that of\r\nCarolina; different in form, in color and in quality. We know that in\r\nAsia they have several distinct species of this grain. Monsieur Poivre,\r\na former Governor of the Isle of France, in travelling through several\r\ncountries of Asia, observed with particular attention the objects of\r\ntheir agriculture, and he tells us, that in Cochin-China they cultivate\r\nsix several kinds of rice, which he describes, three of them requiring\r\nwater, and three growing on highlands. The rice of Carolina is said to\r\nhave come from Madagascar, and De Poivre tells us, it is the white rice\r\nwhich is cultivated there. This favors the probability of its being of a\r\ndifferent species originally, from that of Piedmont; and time, culture\r\nand climate may have made it still more different. Under this idea, I\r\nthought it would be well to furnish you with some of the Piedmont rice,\r\nunhusked, but was told it was contrary to the laws to export it in that\r\nform. I took such measures as I could, however, to have a quantity brought\r\nout, and lest these should fail, I brought, myself, a few pounds. A part\r\nof this I have addressed to you by the way of London; a part comes with\r\nthis letter; and I shall send another parcel by some other conveyance,\r\nto prevent the danger of miscarriage. Any one of them arriving safe, may\r\nserve to put in seed, should the society think it an object. This seed\r\ntoo, coming from Vercelli, where the best rice is supposed to grow, is\r\nmore to be depended on than what may be sent me hereafter. There is a rice\r\nfrom the Levant, which is considered as of a quality still different,\r\nand some think it superior to that of Piedmont. The troubles which have\r\nexisted in that country for several years back, have intercepted it from\r\nthe European market, so that it is become almost unknown. I procured\r\na bag of it, however, at Marseilles, and another of the best rice of\r\nLombardy, which are on their way to this place, and when arrived, I will\r\nforward you a quantity of each, sufficient to enable you to judge of their\r\nqualities when prepared for the table. I have also taken measures to have\r\na quantity of it brought from the Levant, unhusked. If I succeed, it shall\r\nbe forwarded in like manner. I should think it certainly advantageous to\r\ncultivate, in Carolina and Georgia, the two qualities demanded at market,\r\nbecause the progress of culture, with us, may soon get beyond the demand\r\nfor the white rice; and because too, there is often a brisk demand for\r\nthe one quality, when the market is glutted with the other. I should\r\nhope there would be no danger of losing the species of white rice, by a\r\nconfusion with the other. This would be a real misfortune, as I should not\r\nhesitate to pronounce the white, upon the whole, the most precious of the\r\ntwo, for us.\r\n\r\nThe dry rice of Cochin-China has the reputation of being the whitest to\r\nthe eye, best flavored to the taste, and most productive. It seems then\r\nto unite the good qualities of both the others known to us. Could it\r\nsupplant them, it would be a great happiness, as it would enable us to get\r\nrid of those ponds of stagnant water, so fatal to human health and life.\r\nBut such is the force of habit, and caprice of taste, that we could not\r\nbe sure beforehand it would produce this effect. The experiment, however,\r\nis worth trying, should it only end in producing a third quality, and\r\nincreasing the demand. I will endeavor to procure some to be brought from\r\nCochin-China. The event, however, will be uncertain and distant.\r\n\r\nI was induced, in the course of my journey through the south of France,\r\nto pay very particular attention to the objects of their culture,\r\nbecause the resemblance of their climate to that of the southern parts\r\nof the United States, authorizes us to presume we may adopt any of their\r\narticles of culture, which we would wish for. We should not wish for their\r\nwines, though they are good and abundant. The culture of the vine is not\r\ndesirable in lands capable of producing anything else. It is a species\r\nof gambling, and of desperate gambling too, wherein, whether you make\r\nmuch or nothing, you are equally ruined. The middling crop alone is the\r\nsaving point, and that the seasons seldom hit. Accordingly, we see much\r\nwretchedness among this class of cultivators. Wine, too, is so cheap in\r\nthese countries, that a laborer with us, employed in the culture of any\r\nother article, may exchange it for wine, more and better than he could\r\nraise himself. It is a resource for a country, the whole of whose good\r\nsoil is otherwise employed, and which still has some barren spots, and\r\nsurplus of population to employ on them. There the vine is good, because\r\nit is something in the place of nothing. It may become a resource to us\r\nat a still earlier period; when the increase of population shall increase\r\nour productions beyond the demand for them, both at home and abroad.\r\nInstead of going on to make an useless surplus of them, we may employ our\r\nsupernumerary hands on the vine. But that period is not yet arrived.\r\n\r\nThe almond tree is also so precarious, that none can depend for\r\nsubsistence on its produce, but persons of capital.\r\n\r\nThe caper, though a more tender plant, is more certain in its produce,\r\nbecause a mound of earth of the size of a cucumber hill, thrown over the\r\nplant in the fall, protects it effectually against the cold of winter.\r\nWhen the danger of frost is over in the spring, they uncover it, and\r\nbegin its culture. There is a great deal of this in the neighborhood of\r\nToulon. The plants are set about eight feet apart, and yield, one year\r\nwith another, about two pounds of caper each, worth on the spot sixpence\r\nsterling per pound. They require little culture, and this may be performed\r\neither with the plough or hoe. The principal work is the gathering of the\r\nfruit as it forms. Every plant must be picked every other day, from the\r\nlast of June till the middle of October. But this is the work of women\r\nand children. This plant does well in any kind of soil which is dry, or\r\neven in walls where there is no soil, and it lasts the life of a man.\r\nToulon would be the proper port to apply for them. I must observe, that\r\nthe preceding details cannot be relied on with the fullest certainty,\r\nbecause, in the canton where this plant is cultivated, the inhabitants\r\nspeak no written language, but a medley, which I could understand but very\r\nimperfectly.\r\n\r\nThe fig and mulberry are so well known in America, that nothing need be\r\nsaid of them. Their culture, too, is by women and children, and therefore\r\nearnestly to be desired in countries where there are slaves. In these, the\r\nwomen and children are often employed in labors disproportioned to their\r\nsex and age. By presenting to the master objects of culture, easier and\r\nequally beneficial, all temptation to misemploy them would be removed,\r\nand the lot of this tender part of our species be much softened. By\r\nvarying, too, the articles of culture, we multiply the chances for making\r\nsomething, and disarm the seasons in a proportionable degree, of their\r\ncalamitous effects.\r\n\r\nThe olive is a tree the least known in America, and yet the most worthy\r\nof being known. Of all the gifts of heaven to man, it is next to the\r\nmost precious, if it be not the most precious. Perhaps it may claim\r\na preference even to bread, because there is such an infinitude of\r\nvegetables, which it renders a proper and comfortable nourishment. In\r\npassing the Alps at the Col de Tende, where they are mere masses of rock,\r\nwherever there happens to be a little soil, there are a number of olive\r\ntrees, and a village supported by them. Take away these trees, and the\r\nsame ground in corn would not support a single family. A pound of oil,\r\nwhich can be bought for three or four pence sterling, is equivalent to\r\nmany pounds of flesh, by the quantity of vegetables it will prepare,\r\nand render fit and comfortable food. Without this tree, the country\r\nof Provence and territory of Genoa would not support one-half, perhaps\r\nnot one-third, their present inhabitants. The nature of the soil is of\r\nlittle consequence if it be dry. The trees are planted from fifteen to\r\ntwenty feet apart, and when tolerably good, will yield fifteen or twenty\r\npounds of oil yearly, one with another. There are trees which yield much\r\nmore. They begin to render good crops at twenty years old, and last till\r\nkilled by cold, which happens at some time or other, even in their best\r\npositions in France. But they put out again from their roots. In Italy,\r\nI am told, they have trees two hundred years old. They afford an easy but\r\nconstant employment through the year, and require so little nourishment,\r\nthat if the soil be fit for any other production, it may be cultivated\r\namong the olive trees without injuring them. The northern limits of\r\nthis tree are the mountains of the Cevennes, from about the meridian of\r\nCarcassonne to the Rhone, and from thence, the Alps and Apennines as far\r\nas Genoa, I know, and how much farther I am not informed. The shelter of\r\nthese mountains may be considered as equivalent to a degree and a-half of\r\nlatitude, at least, because westward of the commencement of the Cevennes,\r\nthere are no olive trees in 43½˚ or even 43˚ of latitude, whereas, we\r\nfind them _now_ on the Rhone at Pierrelatte, in 44½˚, and _formerly_\r\nthey were at Tains, above the mouth of the Isere, in 45˚, sheltered by\r\nthe near approach of the Cevennes and Alps, which only leave there a\r\npassage for the Rhone. Whether such a shelter exists or not in the States\r\nof South Carolina and Georgia, I know not. But this we may say, either\r\nthat it exists or that it is not necessary there, because we know that\r\nthey produce the orange in open air; and wherever the orange will stand\r\nat all, experience shows that the olive will stand well, being a hardier\r\ntree. Notwithstanding the great quantities of oil made in France, they\r\nhave not enough for their own consumption, and therefore import from\r\nother countries. This is an article, the consumption of which will always\r\nkeep pace with its production. Raise it, and it begets it own demand.\r\nLittle is carried to America, because Europe has it not to spare. We,\r\ntherefore, have not learned the use of it. But cover the southern States\r\nwith it, and every man will become a consumer of oil, within whose reach\r\nit can be brought in point of price. If the memory of those persons is\r\nheld in great respect in South Carolina who introduced there the culture\r\nof rice, a plant which sows life and death with almost equal hand, what\r\nobligations would be due to him who should introduce the olive tree, and\r\nset the example of its culture! Were the owner of slaves to view it only\r\nas the means of bettering their condition, how much would he better that\r\nby planting one of those trees for every slave he possessed! Having been\r\nmyself an eye witness to the blessings which this tree sheds on the poor,\r\nI never had my wishes so kindled for the introduction of any article\r\nof new culture into our own country. South Carolina and Georgia appear\r\nto me to be the States, wherein its success, in favorable positions at\r\nleast, could not be doubted, and I flattered myself it would come within\r\nthe views of the society for agriculture to begin the experiments which\r\nare to prove its practicability. Carcassonne is the place from which the\r\nplants may be most certainly and cheaply obtained. They can be sent from\r\nthence by water to Bordeaux, where they may be embarked on vessels bound\r\nfor Charleston. There is too little intercourse between Charleston and\r\nMarseilles to propose this as the port of exportation. I offer my services\r\nto the society for the obtaining and forwarding any number of plants which\r\nmay be desired.\r\n\r\nBefore I quit the subject of climates, and the plants adapted to them,\r\nI will add, as a matter of curiosity, and of some utility too, that my\r\njourney through the southern parts of France, and the territory of Genoa,\r\nbut still more the crossing of the Alps, enabled me to form a scale of\r\nthe tenderer plants, and to arrange them according to their different\r\npowers of resisting cold. In passing the Alps at the Col de Tende, we\r\ncross three very high mountains successively. In ascending, we lose these\r\nplants, one after another, as we rise, and find them again in the contrary\r\norder as we descend on the other side; and this is repeated three times.\r\nTheir order, proceeding from the tenderest to the hardiest, is as follows:\r\ncaper, orange, palm, aloe, olive, pomegranate, walnut, fig, almond. But\r\nthis must be understood of the plant only; for as to the fruit, the order\r\nis somewhat different. The caper, for example, is the tenderest plant,\r\nyet, being so easily protected, it is among the most certain in its fruit.\r\nThe almond, the hardiest, loses its fruit the oftenest, on account of its\r\nforwardness. The palm, hardier than the caper and orange, never produces\r\nperfect fruit here.\r\n\r\nI had the honor of sending you, the last year, some seeds of the sulla of\r\nMalta, or Spanish St. Foin. Lest they should have miscarried, I now pack\r\nwith the rice a cannister of the same kind of seed, raised by myself. By\r\nColonel Franks, in the month of February last, I sent a parcel of acorns\r\nof the cork oak, which I desired him to ask the favor of the Delegates of\r\nSouth Carolina in Congress to forward to you.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO F. HOPKINSON, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, August 1, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--A journey into the southern parts of France and northern of\r\nItaly must apologize to you for the length of time elapsed since my last,\r\nand for the delay of acknowledging the receipt of your favors of November\r\n8 and December 9, 1786, and April 14, 1787. Your two phials of essence\r\nde l'Orient arrived during that interval, and got separated from the\r\nletters which accompanied them, so that I could not be sure which was your\r\nfirst preparation, and which was your second. But I suppose, from some\r\ncircumstances, that the small phial was the first, and the larger one the\r\nsecond. This was entirely spoiled, so that nothing was distinguishable\r\nfrom it. The matter in the small phial was also too much spoiled for\r\nuse; but the pearl merchant, from whom I got my details, said he could\r\njudge, from what remained, that it had been very good; that you had a\r\nvery considerable knowledge in the manner of preparing, but that there\r\nwas still one thing wanting which made the secret of the art; that this is\r\nnot only a secret of the art, but of every individual workman who will not\r\ncommunicate to his fellows, believing his own method the best; that of ten\r\ndifferent workmen, all will practice different operations, and only one\r\nof the ten be the right one; that the secret consists only in preparing\r\nthe fish, all the other parts of the process in the pearl manufactory\r\nbeing known. That experience has proved it to be absolutely impossible\r\nfor the matter to cross the sea without being spoiled; but that if you\r\nwill send some in the best state you can, he will make pearls of it, and\r\nsend to you that you may judge of them yourself. He says the only possible\r\nmethod of making anything of it would be for a workman to go over. He\r\nwould not engage in this, nor would he buy, because he says it is their\r\ncustom to have contracts for nine years' supply from the fishermen, and\r\nthat his contract furnishes him with as much as he can sell in the present\r\ndeclining state of the pearl trade; that they have been long getting out\r\nof fashion, polite people not wearing them at all, and the poor not able\r\nto give a price; that their calling is, in fact, annihilating; that when\r\nhe renews his contract he shall be obliged to reduce the price he pays\r\ntwenty-five per cent.; that the matter sells from five to eight livres the\r\nFrench pound, but most generally at six livres. He showed me a necklace\r\nof twelve strands, which used to sell at ten livres, and now sells for\r\ntwo and a half. He observed that the length of time the matter will keep\r\ndepends on the strength of the spirit of wine. The result is, then, that\r\nyou must send me a sample of your very best, and write what you would\r\npropose after weighing these circumstances. The leg and feathers of the\r\nbird are also arrived; but the comb, which you mention as annexed to the\r\nfoot, has totally disappeared. I suppose this is the effect of its drying.\r\nI have not yet had an opportunity of giving it to Monsieur de Buffon,\r\nbut expect to do it soon. I thank you for the trouble you have taken with\r\nMadame Champne's letters, and must give you another, that of enquiring for\r\nJames Lillie, belonging to the privateer General Mercer, of Philadelphia,\r\nthe property of Iroon, Carsons and Semple. Richard Graham & Co., merchants\r\nof Philadelphia, seem to have been also interested; and Isaac Robinson,\r\nGraham's son-in-law, to have commanded her. For the details I refer you\r\nto the enclosed paper I received from a Madame Ferrier, sister to James\r\nLillie, from which you will perceive he has not been heard of since\r\n1779. I receive many of these applications which humanity cannot refuse,\r\nand I have no means of complying with them but by troubling gentlemen\r\non the spot. This, I hope, will be my apology. I am obliged to you for\r\nsubscribing to the Columbian Magazine for me. I find it a good thing, and\r\nam sure it will be better from the time you have undertaken it. I wish\r\nyou had commenced before the month of December, for then the abominable\r\nforgery inserted in my name in the last page, would never have appeared.\r\nThis, I suppose, the compilers took from English papers, those infamous\r\nfountains of falsehood. Is it not surprising that our newswriters continue\r\nto copy from those papers, though every one who knows anything of them,\r\nknows they are written by persons who never go out of their garret nor\r\nread a paper? The real letter alluded to was never meant to have been\r\npublic, and therefore was hastily and carelessly dictated while I was\r\nobliged to use the pen of another. It became public, however. I send you a\r\ngenuine copy to justify myself in your eyes against the absurd thing they\r\nhave fathered upon me in the Magazine. Mr. Payne is here with his bridge,\r\nwhich is well thought of. The Academy, to whom it is submitted, have not\r\nyet made their report. I have shipped on board the Mary, Captain Howland,\r\nbound from Havre to New York, a box containing the subsequent livraisons\r\nof the Encyclopedie for yourself and Doctor Franklin from those formerly\r\nsent you to the twenty-two inclusive. I think there are also in it some\r\nnew volumes of the Bibliotheque physico-economique for you. I had received\r\nduplicates of some books (in sheets) for the colleges of Philadelphia and\r\nWilliamsburg. Whether I packed one copy in your box, and one in Madison's,\r\nor both in his, I do not remember. You will see and be so good as to\r\ndeliver the one to the College of Philadelphia, if in your box. The box\r\nis directed to Doctor Franklin, and will be delivered to Mr. Madison at\r\nNew York. I will send you either by this occasion or the next, the cost,\r\nexpenses, &c., &c. Present me in the most respectful and friendly terms\r\nto Dr. Franklin and his grandson, to Mr. Rittenhouse and family, Mrs.\r\nHopkinson the elder and younger. My daughter (my elder one I mean, for\r\nboth are here now) presents her respects also to your mother. I am, with\r\nsentiments of sincere affection, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO R. IZARD, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, August 1, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am to thank you for the laws and newspapers sent me by the\r\nM. de Chateaufort. Your favor of April 4th, has also been duly received.\r\nI am happy to find that the idea of diverting the rice trade from England\r\nto France is thought to be impracticable. A journey which I made from\r\nMarseilles lately, in Lombardy, in order to acquire information relative\r\nto their rice, has corrected the misinformation which the retailers\r\nof rice in this capital had given me. I am satisfied that the rice of\r\nLombardy is of a different species from yours. The exportation of it in\r\nthe husk being prohibited, I could not bring with me but as much as my\r\npockets would hold, which I have sent to your society of agriculture. It\r\nmay serve to raise seed from. I have taken measures for a couple of sacks,\r\nbut I do not make sure of them, nor rely so much on their quality as on\r\nthe parcel I brought myself. I have written so fully on this subject to\r\nMr. Drayton, that, without repeating it here, I will take the liberty\r\nof referring you to that letter. I have endeavored to prevail upon the\r\nmerchants in this country to engage in the rice trade. I enclose you\r\nthe proposals of Messrs. Berard & Co., for that effect. They are a very\r\nsolid house. One of them resides here. Their principal establishment is\r\nat L'Orient, where they would prefer receiving consignments of rice; but\r\nthey will receive them anywhere else, and should suppose Honfleur the best\r\nport, and next to that Bordeaux. You observe they will answer bills to the\r\namount of twelve or fifteen livres the French quintal, if accompanying\r\nthe bill of lading, and will pay the surplus of the proceeds as soon as\r\nreceived. If they sell at Havre or Rouen, they may receive ready money,\r\nand of course pay the balance soon; if they sell at Paris, it must be\r\non a year's credit (because this will be to the retailers). The money,\r\ntherefore, will be received later, but it will be at least six livres the\r\nquintal more; a difference well worth waiting for. I know of no mercantile\r\nhouse in France of surer bottom.\r\n\r\nAffairs in Europe seem to threaten war. Yet I think all may be settled\r\nwithout it. The Emperor disapproves of the concessions made to the\r\nNetherlands by their governors, but called for deputies to consult on\r\nthe matter. They have sent deputies without power to yield a jot, and go\r\non arming. From the character of their Sovereign, it is probable he will\r\navail himself of this deputation to concede their demands. The affairs of\r\nHolland are so thoroughly embroiled, that they would certainly produce a\r\nwar if France and England were in a condition for it. But they are not,\r\nand they will therefore find out some arrangement either perpetual or\r\ntemporary to stop the progress of the civil war begun in that country.\r\nA spirit of distrust in the government here, and confidence in their own\r\nforce and rights, is pervading all ranks. It will be well if it awaits the\r\ngood which will be worked by the provincial assemblies, and will content\r\nitself with that. The parliament demand an assembly of the States; they\r\nare supported by the ministers of the nation, and the object of asking\r\nthat assembly is to fix a constitution, and to limit expenses. They refuse\r\nto register any edict for a new tax. This has so far lessened the credit\r\nof government, that the purse of the money lender is shut. They speak\r\nhere as freely as Junius wrote. Yet it is possible that in the event\r\nof war, the spirit of the nation would rise to support a cause which is\r\napproved--I mean that of Holland.\r\n\r\nI have had the Messrs. Le Coulteux sounded on the subject of lending\r\nmoney. I had before tried the same thing with others. But nothing is to be\r\nobtained for persons on our side the water. They have no confidence in our\r\nlaws. Besides, all the money men are playing deeply in the stocks of the\r\ncountry. The spirit of \"_agiotage_\" (as they call it) was never so high\r\nin any country before. It will probably produce as total deprivation of\r\nmorals as the system of law did. All the money of France is now employed\r\nin this, none being free even for the purposes of commerce, which suffers\r\nimmensely from this cause.\r\n\r\nBefore I conclude, I must add, on the subject of rice, that, what cannot\r\narrive here a month before the careme, would miss its sale, and must\r\ntherefore go to another market. The merchant, however, to whom it is\r\nconsigned, will be competent to this measure whenever he finds it a\r\nnecessary one. I beg leave to be presented very respectfully to Mrs. Izard\r\nand your family, and to assure you of the sincere sentiments of esteem and\r\nattachment with which I am, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, August 2, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My last was of June the 20th. Yours, received since that date,\r\nare of May the 15th, and June the 6th. In mine I acknowledged the receipt\r\nof the paccan nuts which came sealed up. I have reason to believe those\r\nin the box have arrived at L'Orient. By the Mary, Captain Howland, lately\r\nsailed from Havre to New York, I shipped three boxes of books, one marked\r\nJ. M. for yourself, one marked B. F. for Dr. Franklin, and one marked W.\r\nH. for William Hay in Richmond. I have taken the liberty of addressing\r\nthem all to you, as you will see by the enclosed bill of lading, in\r\nhopes you would be so good as to forward the other two. You will have\r\nopportunities of calling on the gentlemen for the freight, &c. In yours\r\nyou will find the books noted in the account, inclosed herewith. You have\r\nnow Mabby's works complete, except that on Poland, which I have never\r\nbeen able to get, but shall not cease to search for. Some other volumes\r\nare wanting too, to complete your collection of Chronologies. The fourth\r\nvolume of D'Albon was lost by the bookbinder, and I have not yet been\r\nable to get one to replace it. I shall continue to try. The Memoires sur\r\nles droits et impositions en Europe, (cited by Smith,) was a scarce and\r\nexcessively dear book. They are now reprinting it. I think it will be in\r\nthree or four quartos, of from nine to twelve livres a volume. When it is\r\nfinished, I shall take a copy for you. Amelot's travels into China, I can\r\nlearn nothing of. I put among the books sent you two somewhat voluminous,\r\nand the object of which will need explanation; these are the Tableau\r\nde Paris and L'espion Anglois. The former is truly a picture of private\r\nmanners in Paris, but presented on the dark side, and a little darkened\r\nmoreover. But there is so much truth in its ground-work, that it will\r\nbe well worth your reading. You will then know Paris (and probably the\r\nother large cities of Europe) as well as if you had been there for years.\r\nL'espion Anglois is no caricature. It will give you a just idea of the\r\nwheels by which the machine of government is worked here. There are in\r\nit also many interesting details of the last war, which, in general, may\r\nbe relied on. It may be considered as the small history of great events.\r\nI am in hopes, when you shall have read them, you will not think I have\r\nmisspent your money for them. My method for making out this assortment\r\nwas, to revise the list of my own purchases since the invoice of 1785,\r\nand to select such as I had found worth your having. Besides this, I have\r\ncasually met with and purchased some few curious and cheap things.\r\n\r\nI must trouble you on behalf of a Mr. Thomas Burke, at Loughburke, near\r\nLoughrea, in Ireland, whose brother, James Burke, is supposed to have\r\ndied in 1785, on his passage from Jamaica, or St. Eustatius to New York.\r\nHis property on board the vessel is understood to have come to the hands\r\nof alderman Groom at New York. The enclosed copy of a letter to him, will\r\nmore fully explain it. A particular friend of mine here applies to me for\r\ninformation, which I must ask the favor of you to procure, and forward to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nWriting news to others, much pressed in time, and making this letter\r\none of private business, I did not intend to have said anything to you\r\non political subjects. But I must press one subject. Mr. Adams informs\r\nme he has borrowed money in Holland, which, if confirmed by Congress,\r\nwill enable them to pay, not only the interest due here to the foreign\r\nofficers, but the principal. Let me beseech you to reflect on the\r\nexpediency of transferring this debt to Holland. All our other debts in\r\nEurope do not injure our reputation so much as this. These gentlemen have\r\nconnections both in and out of office, and these again their connections,\r\nso that our default on this article is further known, more blamed, and\r\nexcites worst dispositions against us, than you can conceive. If you\r\nthink as I do, pray try to procure an order for paying off their capital.\r\nMr. Adams adds, that if any certain tax is provided for the payment of\r\ninterest, Congress may borrow enough in Holland to pay off their whole\r\ndebts in France, both public and private, to the crown, to the Farmers,\r\nand to Beaumarchais. Surely it will be better to transfer these debts\r\nto Holland. So critical is the state of that country, that I imagine the\r\nmoneyed men of it would be glad to place their money in foreign countries,\r\nand that Mr. Adams could borrow there for us, without a certain tax for\r\nthe interest, and saving our faith too, by previous explanations on that\r\nsubject. This country is really supposed on the eve of a * * * * Such\r\na spirit has risen within a few weeks, as could not have been believed.\r\nThey see the great deficit in their revenues, and the hopes of economy\r\nlessen daily. The parliament refuse to register any act for a new tax,\r\nand require an Assembly of the States. The object of this Assembly\r\nis evidently to give law to the King, to fix a constitution, to limit\r\nexpenses. These views are said to gain upon the nation.[E]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA final decision of some sort should be made on Beaumarchais' affairs.\r\n\r\nI am, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem, dear Sir, your friend\r\nand servant.\r\n\r\n    [E] [The parts of this letter marked by asterisks, are in cypher,\r\n    and unintelligible.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS BARCLAY.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, August 3, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am now to acknowledge the receipt of your several favors of\r\nJune the 29th, and July the 6th and 8th.\r\n\r\nI am of opinion that the affair of Geraud and Roland in Holland had\r\nbetter be committed to Mr. Dumas in Holland, as lawsuits must be always\r\nattended to by some person on the spot. For the same reason, I think that\r\nof La Vayse and Puchilberg should be managed by the agent at L'Orient,\r\nand Gruel's by the agent at Nantes. I shall always be ready to assist\r\nthe agents of L'Orient and Nantes in any way in my power; but were the\r\ndetails to be left to me, they would languish necessarily, on account of\r\nmy distance from the place, and perhaps suffer too, for want of verbal\r\nconsultations with the lawyers entrusted with them. You are now with\r\nCongress, and can take their orders on the subject. I shall, therefore,\r\ndo nothing in these matters, in reliance that you will put them into\r\nsuch channel as they direct, furnishing the necessary documents and\r\nexplanations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith respect to the French affair, being perfectly satisfied myself, I\r\nhave not ceased, nor shall I cease, endeavoring to satisfy others, that\r\nyour conduct has been that of an honest and honorable debtor, and theirs\r\nthe counterpart of Shylock in the play. I enclose you a letter containing\r\nmy testimony on your general conduct, which I have written to relieve a\r\ndebt of justice pressing on my mind, well knowing, at the same time, you\r\nwill not stand in need of it in America. Your conduct is too well known to\r\nCongress, your character to all the world, to need any testimonials.\r\n\r\nThe moment I close my despatches for the packet, which will be the\r\n9th instant, I shall, with great pleasure, go to pay my respects to\r\nMrs. Barclay at St. Germains, to satisfy her on the subject of your\r\ntransactions, and to assure her that my resources shall be hers, as long\r\nas I have any. A multitude of letters to write, prevents my entering into\r\nthe field of public news, further than to observe, that it is extremely\r\ndoubtful whether the affairs of Holland will, or will not produce a war\r\nbetween France, on one side, and England and Prussia, on the other.\r\n\r\nI beg you to accept assurances of the sincere esteem and respect with\r\nwhich I have the honor to be, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BARCLAY.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, August 3, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--As you have acted since my arrival in France, in the characters\r\nof Consul-General for that country, and Minister to the Court of Morocco,\r\nand also as agent in some particular transactions for the State of\r\nVirginia, I think it is a duty to yourself, to truth, and to justice,\r\non your departure for America, to declare that, in all these characters,\r\nas far as has come within my notice, you have acted with judgment, with\r\nattention, with integrity and honor. I beg you to accept this feeble\r\ntribute to truth, and assurances of sincere attachment and friendship\r\nfrom, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY EDWARD RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, August 3, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--A journey into the southern parts of France, and northern of\r\nItaly, has prevented my sooner acknowledging the receipt of your private\r\nfavors of July 12th, 1786, and January 28 and May 3, 1787. I am anxious\r\nto hear what you have done in your federal convention. I am in hopes at\r\nleast you will persuade the States to commit their commercial arrangements\r\nto Congress, and to enable them to pay their debts, interest and capital.\r\nThe coercive powers supposed to be wanting in the federal head, I am of\r\nopinion they possess by the law of nature, which authorizes one party to\r\nan agreement to compel the other to performance. A delinquent State makes\r\nitself a party against the rest of the confederacy.\r\n\r\nWe have at present two fires kindled in Europe; 1, in Brabant. The\r\nEmperor, the moment of his return to Vienna, disavowed the concessions\r\nwhich had been made by his governors to quiet the Brabantines. They\r\nprepared, therefore, for regular resistance. But as the emperor had,\r\nat the same time, called for deputies to be sent to Vienna to consult\r\non their affairs, they have sent them, but without power to conclude\r\nanything, and in the meantime they go on arming. The enterprising,\r\nunpersevering, capricious, Thrasonic character of their Sovereign renders\r\nit probable he will avail himself of this little condescendence in the\r\nBrabantines to recede from all his innovations. 2. The Dutch are every now\r\nand then cutting one another's throats. The party of the Stadtholder is\r\nstrongest within the confederacy, and is gaining ground. He has a majority\r\nin the States General, and a strong party in the States of Holland. His\r\nwant of money is supplied by his cousin George. England and Prussia abet\r\nhis usurpations, and France the patriotic party. Were England and France\r\nin a condition to go to war, there is no question but they would have been\r\nat it before now. But their insuperable poverty renders it probable they\r\nwill compel a suspension of hostilities, and either arrange and force a\r\nsettlement on the Dutch, or if they cannot agree themselves on this, they\r\nwill try to protract things by negotiation. Can I be useful to you here in\r\nanything in the purchase of books, of wines, of fruits, of modes for Mrs.\r\nRandolph, or anything else? As to books, they are cheaper here than in\r\nEngland, excepting those in Latin, Greek, or English. As to wines, I have\r\nthe best Vignerons of Bordeaux, Burgundy and Frontignan. Genuine wines can\r\nnever be had but of the Vigneron. The best of Bordeaux cost three livres\r\nthe bottle, but good may be bought for two. Command me freely, assured\r\nthat I shall serve you cheerfully, and that I am with respects to Mrs.\r\nRandolph and attachment to yourself, dear Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, August 3, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am to acknowledge the receipt of your Excellency's letters of\r\nJanuary 28th, and May 4th, which have come to hand since the date of mine\r\nof February 7th. Immediately on the receipt of the former I caused enquiry\r\nto be made relative to the bayonets, and found that they had certainly\r\nbeen packed with the muskets. Your Excellency's favor of May 4th renders\r\nunnecessary the sending the proofs. There have been shipped in the whole\r\nfrom Bordeaux 3,400 stand of arms, and from Havre 3,406 cartouch boxes,\r\nwhich I hope have come safely to hand. Besides these there has been a\r\nshipment from Bordeaux of powder, &c., made by Mr. Barclay. This was but\r\nthe half of what was intended, and of what Mr. Barclay had contracted\r\nfor. But his bill on Mr. Grand was protested on a misconception of Mr.\r\nGrand's, who, by a mixture of your account with that of the United States,\r\nhad supposed he had but about 12,000 livres of your money in his hands. I\r\nwas absent on a journey, and happened in the course of that to meet with\r\nMr. Barclay at Bordeaux, and we concluded to send you half the quantity.\r\nSince my return, I have not been able to have your account exactly settled\r\nso as to render it now; but am able to say in general and with certainty,\r\nthat everything sent you has been paid, and that after paying Houdon 3,000\r\nlivres for the second bust of the Marquis de La Fayette now nearly ready\r\nto be sent off for you, and 10,000 livres the second payment due towards\r\nGeneral Washington's statue, there will remain enough in Mr. Grand's\r\nhands to pay for a quantity of powder, &c., equal to that sent you by Mr.\r\nBarclay from Bordeaux, which shall accordingly be done. This balance on\r\nhand includes 5,300 livres paid by Mr. Littlepage, which, though he has\r\nsent us a bill for, six or eight months ago, we had refused to receive\r\ntill the arrival of your Excellency's letter informing me it had not been\r\npaid in America; it was therefore applied for and received by Mr. Grand\r\na few days ago. Mr. Barclay drew on me for the balance of his account\r\nwith the State of Virginia, 2,370 livres, which I paid; besides these\r\nhe afterwards discovered an omission of 108l. 8s. in his account, which\r\nI pay also, so as to leave your account with him balanced. There is,\r\nhowever, the articles of expenses for young Mercier, which he has neither\r\nentered in your account, nor charged to me in my private account. It yet\r\nremains due to him, therefore, and I shall pay it to him if he applies\r\nto me. I should have called for it, but that he was gone to America\r\nbefore I discovered the omission. Should the State have further occasion\r\nfor arms, your Excellency will be able to judge, combining quality and\r\nprice, whether those of Liege or of France are to be preferred. I shall\r\nwith cheerfulness obey your future orders on this or any other account,\r\nand have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, your Excellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. The original of the report on the inauguration of the bust of the\r\nMarquis de La Fayette accompanies this.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM HAY.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, August 4, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am now to acknowledge the receipt of your two favors of April 26,\r\nand May 3. I have forwarded, by a vessel lately sailed from Havre to New\r\nYork, a box marked W. H., containing the livraisons of the Encyclopedie\r\nsubsequent to those Dr. Currie has delivered you, to the 22d inclusive.\r\nThey are sent to the care of Mr. Madison at Congress, who will forward the\r\nbox to you. There is in it, also, the same livraisons to Colonel Monroe.\r\nI will continue to forward them once or twice a year, as they come out. I\r\nhave stated in a letter to Dr. Currie the cost and expenses of the first\r\ntwenty-two livraisons, to enable yourself and himself to settle. The\r\nfuture shall be charged to you or him, as your agreement shall be. It is\r\nreally a most valuable work, and almost supplies the place of a library.\r\n\r\nI receive from too many quarters the account of the distresses of my\r\ncountrymen to doubt their truth--distresses brought on themselves by\r\na feebleness of mind which calculates very illy its own happiness. It\r\nis a miserable arithmetic which makes any single privation whatever so\r\npainful as a total privation of everything which must necessarily follow\r\nthe living so far beyond our income. What is to extricate us I know\r\nnot, whether law, or loss of credit. If the sources of the former are\r\ncorrupted, so as to prevent justice, the latter must supply its place,\r\nleave us possessed of our infamous gains, but prevent all future ones of\r\nthe same character.\r\n\r\nEurope is in a moment of crisis. The innovations by their sovereign in\r\nthe Austrian Netherlands have produced in the people a determination to\r\nresist. The Emperor, by disavowing the concessions made by his governors\r\nto quiet the people, seemed to take up the gauntlet which they had thrown.\r\nYet it is rather probable he will recede, and all be hushed up there. The\r\nDutch parties are in a course of hostilities which it will be difficult to\r\nsuspend. A war would have been begun before this, between this country on\r\none side, and England and Prussia on the other, had the parties been in\r\na condition for war. Perhaps England might have raised supplies, but it\r\nwould be on a certainty of being crushed under them. This country would\r\nfind greater difficulty. There is, however, a difference in her favor\r\nwhich might reduce her on a level with England: that is, that it would be\r\na popular war here, and an unpopular one in England. Probably the weakness\r\nof the two countries will induce them to join in compelling a suspension\r\nof hostilities, and to make an arrangement for them, or if they cannot\r\nagree in that, they will spin the matter into length by negotiation.\r\nIn fact, though both parties are arming, I do not expect any speedy\r\ncommencement of hostilities. I am, with very great respect and esteem,\r\nSir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. RAMSAY.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, August 4, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of November\r\n8 and April 7, and the pleasure to inform you that the translation of\r\nyour book sells well, and is universally approved. Froulle will send\r\nyou some copies of it, by the first opportunity. I am happy to hear you\r\nare occupied on the general history. It is a subject worthy your pen.\r\nI observe Stockdale in London has printed your work and advertised it\r\nfor sale. Since I wrote to you on the subject of rice, I have had an\r\nopportunity of examining the rice-fields of Lombardy, and having committed\r\nmy observations to writing, in a letter to Mr. Drayton, as President of\r\nthe Agricultural Society, I will take the liberty of referring you to that\r\nletter, in which probably there is little new to your countrymen, though\r\nall was new to me. However, if there be a little new and useful, it will\r\nbe my reward. I have been pressing on the merchants here the expediency\r\nof enticing the rice-trade to Bordeaux and Honfleur. At length, I have\r\nreceived the enclosed propositions. They are a firm and very solid house.\r\nI wish they may produce the effect desired. I have enclosed a copy to\r\nMr. Izard, but forgot to mention to him, on the subject of white plains\r\nand hoes (particularly named in his letter to me), that this house will\r\nbegin by furnishing them from England, which they think they can do as\r\ncheap as you can receive them directly from England. The allowance made\r\nto wholesale purchasers will countervail the double voyage. They hope\r\nthat after a while they can have them imitated here. Will you be so good\r\nas to mention this to Mr. Izard? I fear that my zeal will make me expose\r\nmyself to ridicule in this business, for I am no merchant, and still less\r\nknowing in the culture of rice. But this risk becomes a duty by the bare\r\npossibility of doing good. You mention in your letter, your instalment\r\nlaw as needing apology. I have never heard the payment by instalment\r\ncomplained of in Europe. On the contrary, in the conferences Mr. Adams\r\nand myself had with merchants in London, they admitted the necessity of\r\nthem. It is only necessary that the terms be faithfully observed, and the\r\npayments be in real money. I am sensible that there are defects in our\r\nfederal government, yet they are so much lighter than those of monarchies,\r\nthat I view them with much indulgence. I rely, too, on the good sense of\r\nthe people for remedy, whereas the evils of monarchical government are\r\nbeyond remedy. If any of our countrymen wish for a King, give them Æsop's\r\nfable of the frogs who asked a King; if this does not cure them, send them\r\nto Europe. They will go back good republicans. Whether we shall have war\r\nor not, is still doubtful. I conclude we shall not, from the inability\r\nof both France and England to undertake a war. But our friend George\r\nis rather remarkable for doing exactly what he ought not to do. He may,\r\ntherefore, force on a war in favor of his cousin of Holland. I am, with\r\nvery great esteem, Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. CARRINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, August 4, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Since mine of the 16th of January, I have been honored by your\r\nfavors of April the 24th and June the 9th. I am happy to find that the\r\nStates have come so generally into the schemes of the federal convention,\r\nfrom which, I am sure, we shall see wise propositions. I confess, I do not\r\ngo as far in the reforms thought necessary, as some of my correspondents\r\nin America; but if the convention should adopt such propositions, I shall\r\nsuppose them necessary. My general plan would be, to make the States\r\none as to everything connected with foreign nations, and several as to\r\neverything purely domestic. But with all the imperfections of our present\r\ngovernment, it is without comparison the best existing, or that ever\r\ndid exist. Its greatest defect is the imperfect manner in which matters\r\nof commerce have been provided for. It has been so often said, as to be\r\ngenerally believed, that Congress have no power by the Confederation\r\nto enforce anything; for example, contributions of money. It was not\r\nnecessary to give them that power expressly; they have it by the law of\r\nnature. When two parties make a compact, there results to each a power of\r\ncompelling the other to execute it. Compulsion was never so easy as in our\r\ncase, where a single frigate would soon levy on the commerce of any State\r\nthe deficiency of its contributions; nor more safe than in the hands of\r\nCongress, which has always shown that it would wait, as it ought to do,\r\nto the last extremities, before it would execute any of its powers which\r\nare disagreeable. I think it very material, to separate, in the hands of\r\nCongress, the executive and legislative powers, as the judiciary already\r\nare, in some degree. This, I hope, will be done. The want of it has been\r\nthe source of more evil than we have experienced from any other cause.\r\nNothing is so embarrassing nor so mischievous, in a great assembly, as the\r\ndetails of execution. The smallest trifle of that kind occupies as long\r\nas the most important act of legislation, and takes place of everything\r\nelse. Let any man recollect, or look over, the files of Congress; he will\r\nobserve the most important propositions hanging over, from week to week,\r\nand month to month, till the occasions have passed them, and the things\r\nnever done. I have ever viewed the executive details as the greatest cause\r\nof evil to us, because they in fact place us as if we had no federal head,\r\nby diverting the attention of that head from great to small objects; and\r\nshould this division of power not be recommended by the convention, it is\r\nmy opinion Congress should make it itself, by establishing an executive\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sincere esteem and respect, dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient, most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. CURRIE.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, August 4, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am favored with your letter of May the 2d, and most cordially\r\nsympathise in your late immediate losses. It is a situation in which a\r\nman needs the aid of all his wisdom and philosophy. But as it is better\r\nto turn from the contemplation of our misfortunes to the resources we\r\npossess of extricating ourselves, you will, of course, have found solace\r\nin your vigor of mind, health of body, talents, habits of business, in\r\nthe consideration that you have time yet to retrieve everything, and a\r\nknowledge that the very activity necessary for this, is a state of greater\r\nhappiness than the unoccupied one, to which you had a thought of retiring.\r\nI wish the bulk of my extravagant countrymen had as good prospects and\r\nresources as you. But with many of them, a feebleness of mind makes them\r\nafraid to probe the true state of their affairs, and procrastinate the\r\nreformation which alone can save something, to those who may yet be saved.\r\nHow happy a people were we during the war, from the single circumstance\r\nthat we could not run in debt! This counteracted all the inconveniences\r\nwe felt, as the present facility of ruining ourselves overweighs all the\r\nblessings of peace. I know no condition happier than that of a Virginia\r\nfarmer might be, conducting himself as he did during the war. His estate\r\nsupplies a good table, clothes himself and his family with their ordinary\r\napparel, furnishes a small surplus to buy salt, sugar, coffee, and a\r\nlittle finery for his wife and daughters, enables him to receive and to\r\nvisit his friends, and furnishes him pleasing and healthy occupation. To\r\nsecure all this, he needs but one act of self-denial, to put off buying\r\nanything till he has the money to pay for it. Mr. Ammonett did not come.\r\nHe wrote to me, however, and I am making inquiry for the town and family\r\nhe indicated. As yet, neither can be heard of, and were they to be found,\r\nthe length of time would probably bar all claims against them. I have seen\r\nno object present so many desperate faces. However, if inquiry can lighten\r\nour way, that shall not be wanting, and I will write to him as soon as\r\nwe discover anything, or despair of discovering. Littlepage has succeeded\r\nwell in Poland. He has some office, it is said, worth five hundred guineas\r\na year. The box of seeds you were so kind as to forward me came safe to\r\nhand. The arrival of my daughter, in good health, has been a source of\r\nimmense comfort to me. The injury of which you had heard, was a dislocated\r\nwrist, and though it happened eleven months ago, was a simple dislocation,\r\nand immediately aided by the best surgeon in Paris, it is neither well,\r\nnor ever will be, so as to render me much service. The fingers remain\r\nswelled and crooked, the hand withered, and the joint having a very\r\nconfined motion. You ask me when I shall return? My commission expires\r\nnext spring, and if not renewed, I shall return then. If renewed, I shall\r\nstay somewhat longer; how much, will not depend on me altogether. So far\r\nas it does, I cannot fix the epoch of my return, though I always flatter\r\nmyself it is not very distant. My habits are formed to those of my own\r\ncountry. I am past the time of changing them, and am, therefore, less\r\nhappy anywhere else than there.\r\n\r\nI shall always be happy to hear from you, being with very sincere esteem,\r\ndear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAWKINS.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, August 4, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of March the\r\n8th and June the 9th, and to give you many thanks for the trouble you have\r\ntaken with the dionæa muscipula. I have not yet heard anything of them,\r\nwhich makes me fear they have perished by the way. I believe the most\r\neffectual means of conveying them hither, will be by the seed. I must add\r\nmy thanks, too, for the vocabularies. This is an object I mean to pursue,\r\nas I am persuaded that the only method of investigating the filiation of\r\nthe Indian nations is by that of their languages.\r\n\r\nI look up with you to the federal convention for an amendment of our\r\nfederal affairs. Yet I do not view them in so disadvantageous a light\r\nat present, as some do. And above all things, I am astonished at some\r\npeople's considering a kingly government as a refuge. Advise such to read\r\nthe fable of the frogs who solicited Jupiter for a king. If that does not\r\nput them to rights, send them to Europe, to see something of the trappings\r\nof monarchy, and I will undertake that every man shall go back thoroughly\r\ncured. If all the evils which can arise among us, from the republican form\r\nof government, from this day to the day of judgment, could be put into\r\na scale against what this country suffers from its monarchical form in a\r\nweek, or England in a month, the latter would preponderate. Consider the\r\ncontents of the Red book in England, or the Almanac royale of France, and\r\nsay what a people gain by monarchy. No race of kings has ever presented\r\nabove one man of common sense in twenty generations. The best they can\r\ndo is, to leave things to their ministers; and what are their ministers,\r\nbut a committee, badly chosen? If the king ever meddles, it is to do\r\nharm. Adieu, my dear Sir, and be assured of the esteem of your friend and\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, August 5, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--A journey of between three and four months, into the southern\r\nparts of France and northern of Italy, has prevented my writing to you.\r\nIn the meantime, you have changed your ground, and engaged in different\r\noccupations, so that I know not whether the news of this side the water\r\nwill even amuse you. However, it is all I have for you. The storm which\r\nseemed to be raised suddenly in Brabant, will probably blow over. The\r\nEmperor, on his return to Vienna, pretended to revoke all the concessions\r\nwhich had been made by his Governors General, to his Brabantine subjects;\r\nbut he, at the same time, called for deputies from among them to consult\r\nwith. He will use their agency to draw himself out of the scrape, and\r\nall there, I think, will be quieted. Hostilities go on occasionally in\r\nHolland. France espouses the cause of the Patriots, as you know, and\r\nEngland and Prussia that of the Stadtholder. France and England are both\r\nunwilling to bring on a war, but a hasty move of the King of Prussia will\r\nperplex them. He has thought the stopping his sister sufficient cause\r\nfor sacrificing a hundred or two thousand of his subjects, and as many\r\nHollanders and French. He has therefore ordered twenty thousand men to\r\nmarch, without consulting England, or even his own ministers. He may thus\r\ndrag England into a war, and of course this country, against their will.\r\nBut it is certain they will do everything they can to prevent it; and that\r\nin this at least they agree. Though such a war might be gainful to us,\r\nyet it is much to be deprecated by us at this time. In all probability,\r\nFrance would be unequal to such a war by sea and by land, and it is\r\nnot our interest, or even safe for us, that she should be weakened. The\r\ngreat improvements in their constitution, effected by the Assemblée des\r\nNotables, you are apprized of. That of partitioning the country into a\r\nnumber of subordinate governments, under the administration of Provincial\r\nAssemblies, chosen by the people, is a capital one. But to the delirium of\r\njoy which these improvements gave the nation, a strange reverse of temper\r\nhas suddenly succeeded. The deficiencies of their revenue were exposed,\r\nand they were frightful. Yet there was an appearance of intention to\r\neconomise, and reduce the expenses of government. But expenses are still\r\nvery inconsiderately incurred, and all reformation in that point despaired\r\nof. The public credit is affected; and such a spirit of discontent has\r\narisen, as has never been seen. The parliament refused to register the\r\nedict for a stamp tax, or any other tax, and call for the States General,\r\nwho alone, they say, can impose a new tax. They speak with a boldness\r\nunexampled. The King has called them to Versailles to-morrow, where\r\nhe will hold a _lit de justice_, and compel them to register the tax.\r\nHow the chapter will finish, we must wait to see. By a vessel lately\r\nsailed from Havre to New York, I have sent you some more livraisons of\r\nthe Encyclopedie, down to the 22d inclusive. They were in a box with\r\nDr. Currie's, and addressed to Mr. Madison, who will forward them to\r\nRichmond. I have heard you are in the Assembly. I will beg the favor of\r\nyou, therefore, to give me, at the close of the session, a history of the\r\nmost remarkable acts passed, the parties and views of the House, &c. This,\r\nwith the small news of my country, crops and prices, will furnish you\r\nabundant matter to treat me, while I have nothing to give you in return,\r\nbut the history of the follies of nations in their dotage. Present me\r\nin respectful and friendly terms to Mrs. Monroe, and be assured of the\r\nsincere sentiments of esteem and attachment with which I am, dear Sir,\r\nyour friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE COMMISSIONERS OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, August 5, 1787.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--In my last of June 17, 1787, I had the honor of communicating\r\nto you the information I had received from Mr. Grand, that your funds\r\nhere were out, and he considerably in advance. I took occasion to mention\r\nto him the paragraph in your letter of February 17, wherein you were so\r\nkind as to say your attention should be immediately turned to the making\r\na remittance. However, I understood soon after that he had protested a\r\ndraught of Mr. Carmichael's, as also a smaller one of five hundred livres.\r\nHe called upon me, and explaining to me the extent of his advances,\r\nobserved that he should not be willing to add to them, except so far as\r\nshould be necessary for the private expenses of myself and secretary,\r\nwhich he wished to be reduced as much below the ordinary allowance as\r\nwe could, until remittances should be received. He will send you by this\r\npacket a state of his accounts, by which he informs me that your account\r\nis in arrear about thirty-two thousand livres, advanced by him, and about\r\nfifteen thousand livres from a fund of the State of Virginia, placed\r\nhere for the purchase of arms, making General Washington's statue, &c.\r\nIn examining his accounts, I found by the one he had sent you formerly,\r\nthat you were debited two articles of ten thousand livres and two thousand\r\nseven hundred and twenty-four livres and sixty-six sous, which belonged\r\nto the account of the State of Virginia. This I must explain to you.\r\nThat State had directed me to have the statue of General Washington\r\nmade, and given me assurances such as I could rely on, that I should\r\nreceive funds immediately. Doctor Franklin was setting out to America,\r\nand Houdon, the statuary, expressed a willingness to go with him. But\r\nit was necessary to advance him a sum of money for that purpose. Rather\r\nthan lose the opportunity, I ventured to borrow from the fund of the\r\nUnited States those two sums for the State of Virginia, which I knew\r\nwould be immediately replaced. The funds of the State arrived, (being\r\nnearly two hundred thousand livres,) and enabled me not only to replace\r\nthose sums immediately, but to furnish much larger supplies to the wants\r\nof the United States, when their funds failed. Insomuch that the State\r\nof Virginia is now in advance here for the United States about fifteen\r\nthousand livres, as before mentioned. As yet it has not suffered by any of\r\nthese advances, but having no money left here but this balance, I shall\r\nbe censurable by that State if it be not replaced in time to answer the\r\ndemands on them, which will now be made within a few weeks. Mr. Grand has,\r\nby my direction, credited you in the account he now sends for the two sums\r\nof ten thousand livres and two thousand, seven hundred and twenty-four\r\nlivres and sixty-six sous, improperly charged in your former account. He\r\nhad also debited you in his account for the whole sums paid by the United\r\nStates, as well as those paid by Virginia, as by himself. The purpose of\r\nthis was to keep the accounts unmixed, though in fact the funds have been\r\napplied occasionally in aid of each other.\r\n\r\nI had proposed to Mr. Barclay the settlement of my account before his\r\ndeparture for Morocco, but we concluded it would be better to do it on\r\nhis return, as that would enable me to bring it down to a later day.\r\nIt was not then expected he would be so long detained by that business.\r\nUnfortunately for me, when at L'Orient, on his return to Paris, he found\r\nit more advisable to proceed directly to America, so that I have lost this\r\nopportunity of having my account settled. I shall either do it with him\r\non his return, if he returns soon, or with such other person here as you\r\nwill point out, or I will transmit it with copies of my vouchers, to be\r\nsettled by you, or do whatever else with it you shall please to direct.\r\nThe articles which, from their minuteness, have not admitted the taking\r\nvouchers, I shall be ready to prove by my own oath. In this account I\r\nhave presumed to charge the United States with an outfit. The necessity\r\nof this in the case of a minister, resident, and of course obliged to\r\nestablish a house, is obvious on reflection. There cannot be a surer proof\r\nof its necessity than the experience and consent of all nations, as I\r\nbelieve there is no instance of any nation sending a minister to reside\r\nanywhere without an outfit. A year's salary is the least I have been able\r\nto hear of, and I should be able to show that the articles of clothes,\r\ncarriage and horses, and household furniture, in a very plain style,\r\nhave cost me more than that. When I send you my account, either settled\r\nhere, or to be settled there, I shall take the liberty of referring this\r\narticle to the consideration of Congress. Its reasonableness has appeared\r\nto me so palpable, that I have presumed it would appear so to Congress,\r\nand have therefore kept up the expenses of my house at the current rate\r\nof nine thousand dollars a year. If my expectations should be thought\r\nunreasonable, I shall submit and immediately reduce my establishment, with\r\nsuch rigor, as to make up this article in the shortest time possible. I\r\nenclose you a letter from Fisseaux & Co. on the subject of their loan.\r\nI wish the loan lately obtained by Mr. Adams, may enable you to get rid\r\nof the debt to the Foreign Officers, principal and interest. Indeed,\r\nif Mr. Adams could be charged with the transfer of our whole debt from\r\nthis country to Holland, it would be a most salutary operation. The\r\nconfusions of that country might perhaps facilitate that measure at\r\npresent, though no regular tax could be obtained in the moment for payment\r\nof the interest. I have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most\r\nperfect esteem and respect, gentlemen, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, August 6, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The last letter I had the honor of addressing you, was dated June\r\nthe 21st. I have now that of enclosing you a letter from the Swedish\r\nambassador, praying that inquiry may be made for a vessel of his nation,\r\npiratically carried off, and measures taken relative to the vessel,\r\ncargo and crew. Also a letter from William Russell and others, citizens\r\nof America, concerned in trade to the island of Guadaloupe, addressed to\r\nthe Marechal de Castries, and complaining of the shutting to them the\r\nport of Point à Pitre, and receiving them only at Basse-tern. This was\r\nenclosed to me by the subscribers, to be delivered to the Marechal de\r\nCastries. But the present is not the moment to move in that business;\r\nand moreover, I suppose, that whenever parties are within the reach of\r\nCongress, they should apply to them, and my instructions come through\r\nthat channel. Matters arising within the kingdom of France, to which\r\nmy commission is limited, and not admitting time to take the orders of\r\nCongress, I suppose I may move in originally. I also enclose you the copy\r\nof a letter from Mr. Barclay, closing his proceedings in our affairs with\r\nMorocco. Before this reaches you, he will have had the honor of presenting\r\nhimself to you in person. After his departure, the parliament of Bordeaux\r\ndecided that he was liable to arrest. This was done on a letter from the\r\nminister, informing them that Mr. Barclay was invested with no character\r\nwhich privileged him from arrest. His constant character of consul was\r\nno protection, and they did not explain whether his character to Morocco\r\nwas not originally diplomatic, or was expired. Mr. Barclay's proceedings\r\nunder this commission being now closed, it would be incumbent on me to\r\ndeclare with respect to them, as well as his consular transactions, my\r\nopinion of the judgment, zeal and disinterestedness with which he has\r\nconducted himself; were it not that Congress has been so possessed of\r\nthose transactions from time to time, as to judge for themselves. I\r\ncannot but be uneasy, lest my delay of entering on the subject of the\r\nconsular convention, may be disapproved. My hope was and is, that more\r\npracticable terms might be obtained; in this hope, I do nothing till\r\nfurther orders, observing by an extract from the journals you were pleased\r\nto send me, that Congress have referred the matter to your consideration,\r\nand conscious that we are not suffering in the meantime, as we have not a\r\nsingle consul in France, since the departure of Mr. Barclay. I mentioned\r\nto you in my last, the revival of the hopes of the Chevalier de La\r\nLuzerne. I thought it my duty to remind the Count de Montmorin, the other\r\nday, of the long absence of their minister from Congress. He told me, the\r\nChevalier de La Luzerne would not be sent back, but that we might rely\r\nthat, in the month of October, a person would be sent, with whom we should\r\nbe content. He did not name the person, though there is no doubt that it\r\nis the Count de Mourtier. It is an appointment, which, according to the\r\nopinion I have formed of him, bids as fair to give content, as any one\r\nwhich could be made.\r\n\r\nI also mentioned in my last letter, that I had proposed the reducing the\r\nsubstance of Monsieur de Calonnes' letter into the form of an _Arret_,\r\nwith some alterations, which, on consultation with the merchants at the\r\ndifferent ports I visited, I had found to be necessary. I received, soon\r\nafter, a letter from the Comptroller General, informing me, that the\r\nletter of Monsieur de Calonnes was in a course of execution. Of this, I\r\nenclose you a copy. I was, in that moment, enclosing to him my general\r\nobservations on that letter, a copy of which are also enclosed. In these,\r\nI stated all the alterations I wished to have made. It became expedient,\r\nsoon after, to bring on the article of tobacco; first, to know whether\r\nthe Farmers had executed the order of Bernis, and also to prepare some\r\narrangements to succeed the expiration of this order. So that I am\r\nnow pursuing the whole subject of our commerce, 1, to have necessary\r\namendments made in Monsieur de Calonnes' letter; 2, to put it into a\r\nmore stable form; 3, to have full execution of the order of Bernis; 4, to\r\nprovide arrangements for the article of tobacco, after that order shall\r\nbe expired. By the copy of my letter on the two last points, you will\r\nperceive that I again press the abolition of the Farm of this article.\r\nThe conferences on that subject give no hope of effecting that. Some poor\r\npalliative is probably all we shall obtain. The Marquis de La Fayette\r\ngoes hand in hand with me in all these transactions, and is an invaluable\r\nauxiliary to me. I hope it will not be imputed either to partiality or\r\naffectation, my naming this gentleman so often in my despatches. Were I\r\nnot to do it, it would be a suppression of truth, and the taking to myself\r\nthe whole merit where he has the greatest share.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor, on his return to Vienna, disavowed the concessions of his\r\nGovernors General to his subjects of Brabant. He, at the same time,\r\nproposed their sending deputies to him, to consult on their affairs. They\r\nrefused in the first moment; but afterwards nominated deputies; without\r\ngiving them any power, however, to concede anything. In the meantime,\r\nthey are arming and training themselves. Probably the Emperor will avail\r\nhimself of the aid of these deputies to tread back his steps. He will be\r\nthe more prompt to do this, that he may be in readiness to act freely, if\r\nhe finds occasion, in the new scenes preparing in Holland. What these will\r\nbe cannot be foreseen. You well know, that the original party-divisions\r\nof that country were, into Stadtholderians, Aristocrats, and Democrats.\r\nThere was a subdivision of the Aristocrats, into violent and moderate,\r\nwhich was important. The violent Aristocrats would have wished to preserve\r\nall the powers of government in the hands of the Regents, and that these\r\nshould remain self-elective; but choosing to receive a modification of\r\nthese powers from the Stadtholder, rather than from the people, they\r\nthrew themselves into his scale. The moderate Aristocrats would have\r\nconsented to a temperate mixture of democracy, and particularly, that the\r\nRegents should be elected by the people. They were the declared enemies\r\nof the Stadtholder, and acted in concert with the Democrats, forming with\r\nthem what was called the Patriots. It is the opinion of dispassionate\r\npeople on the spot, that their views might have been effected. But the\r\ndemocratic party aimed at more. They talked of establishing tribunes of\r\nthe people, of annual accounts, of depriving the magistrates at the will\r\nof the people, &c.; of enforcing all this with the arms in the hands\r\nof the _corps francs_; and in some places, as at Heusden, Sprang, &c.,\r\nbegan the execution of these projects. The moderate Aristocrats found it\r\ndifficult to strain their principles to this pitch. A schism took place\r\nbetween them and the Democrats, and the former have for some time, been\r\ndropping off from the latter, into the scale of the Stadtholder. This is\r\nthe fatal coalition which governs without obstacle in Zealand, Friesland,\r\nand Guelderland, which constitutes the States of Utrecht, at Amersfort,\r\nand, with their aid, the plurality in the States General. The States of\r\nHolland, Groningen and Overyssel vote, as yet, in the opposition. But the\r\ncoalition gains ground in the States of Holland, and has been prevalent\r\nin the Council of Amsterdam. If its progress be not stopped by a little\r\nmoderation in the Democrats, it will turn the scale decidedly in favor of\r\nthe Stadtholder, in the event of their being left to themselves without\r\nforeign interference. If foreign powers interfere, their prospect does\r\nnot brighten. I see no sure friends to the Patriots but France, while\r\nPrussia and England are their assured enemies. Nor is it probable that\r\ncharacters so greedy, so enterprising, as the Emperor and Empress, will\r\nbe idle during such a struggle. Their views have long shown which side\r\nthey would take. That France has engaged to interfere, and to support the\r\nPatriots, is beyond doubt. This engagement was entered into during the\r\nlife of the late King of Prussia, whose eye was principally directed on\r\nthe Emperor, and whose dispositions towards the Prince of Orange would\r\nhave permitted him to be clipped a little close. But the present King\r\ncomes in with warmer dispositions towards the Princess his sister. He\r\nhas shown decidedly, that he will support her, even to the destruction\r\nof the balance of Europe, and the disturbance of its peace. The King of\r\nEngland has equally decided to support that house, at the risk of plunging\r\nhis nation into another war. He supplies the Prince with money at this\r\nmoment. A particular remittance of one hundred and twenty thousand guineas\r\nis known of. But his ministry is divided. Pitt is against the King's\r\nopinion, the Duke of Richmond and the rest of the ministers, for it. Or\r\nat least, such is the belief here. Mr. Adams will have informed you more\r\ncertainly. This division in the English ministry, with the ill condition\r\nof their finances for war, produces a disposition, even in the King, to\r\ntry first every pacific measure; and that country and this were laboring\r\njointly to stop the course of hostilities in Holland, to endeavor to\r\neffect an accommodation, and were scarcely executing at all, the armaments\r\nordered in their ports; when all of a sudden, an inflammatory letter\r\nwritten by the Princess of Orange to the King of Prussia, induces him,\r\nwithout consulting England, without consulting even his own Council, to\r\nissue orders by himself to his Generals, to march twenty thousand men, to\r\nrevenge the insult supposed to be offered to his sister. With a pride and\r\negotism planted in the heart of every King, he considers her being stopped\r\nin the road, as a sufficient cause to sacrifice a hundred or two thousand\r\nof his own subjects, and as many of his enemies, and to spread fire,\r\nsword and desolation, over the half of Europe. This hasty measure has\r\nembarrassed England, undesirous of war if it can be avoided, yet unwilling\r\nto separate from the power who is to render its success probable. Still\r\nyou may be assured, that that court is going on in concurrence with this,\r\nto prevent extremities, if possible; always understood, that if the war\r\ncannot be prevented, they will enter into it as parties, and in opposition\r\nto one another. This event is, in my opinion, to be deprecated by the\r\nfriends of France. She never was equal to such a war by land, and such a\r\none by sea; and less so now, than in any moment of the present reign. You\r\nremember that the nation was in a delirium of joy on the convocation of\r\nthe Notables, and on the various reformations agreed on between them and\r\nthe government. The picture of the distress of their finances was indeed\r\nfrightful, but the intentions to reduce them to order seemed serious.\r\nThe constitutional reformations have gone on well, but those of expenses\r\nmake little progress. Some of the most obviously useless have indeed been\r\nlopped off, but the remainder is a heavy mass, difficult to be reduced.\r\nDespair has seized every mind, and they have passed from an extreme of joy\r\nto one of discontent. The parliament, therefore, oppose the registering\r\nany new tax, and insist on an Assembly of the States General. The object\r\nof this is to limit expenses, and dictate a constitution. The edict for\r\nthe stamp tax has been the subject of reiterated orders and refusals to\r\nregister. At length, the King has summoned the parliament to Versailles to\r\nhold a bed of justice, in which he will order them, in person, to register\r\nthe edict. At the moment of my writing, they are gone to Versailles\r\nfor this purpose. There will yet remain to them, to protest against the\r\nregister, as forced, and to issue orders against its execution on pain of\r\ndeath. But as the King would have no peaceable mode of opposition left, it\r\nremains to be seen whether they will push the matter to this extremity. It\r\nis evident, I think, that a spirit of this country is advancing towards\r\na revolution in their constitution. There are not wanting persons at the\r\nhelm, friends to the progress of this spirit. The Provincial Assemblies\r\nwill be the most probable instrument of effecting it.\r\n\r\nSince writing thus far, I have received an intimation, that it will be\r\nagreeable, not to press our commercial regulations at this moment the\r\nministry being too much occupied with the difficulties surrounding them,\r\nto spare a moment on any subject which will admit of delay. Our business\r\nmust, therefore, be suspended for awhile. To press it out of season\r\nwould be to defeat it. It would be felt as a vital benefit here, could\r\nwe relieve their finances, by paying what we owe. Congress will judge\r\nby Mr. Adams' letters, how far the transferring all our debts in this\r\ncountry, to Holland, is practicable. On the replenishing their treasury\r\nwith our principal and interest, I should not be afraid to ask concessions\r\nin favor of our West India trade. It would produce a great change of\r\nopinion as to us and our affairs. In the Assemblée des Notables, hard\r\nthings were said of us. They were induced, however, in committing us to\r\nwriting, to smother their ideas a little. In the votes, now gone to be\r\nprinted, our debt is described in these words. \"The twenty-first article\r\nof the account, formed of the interest of the claims of his majesty on\r\nthe United States of America, cannot be drawn out for the present, except\r\nas a document. The recovery of these claims, as well principal as perhaps\r\neven interest, although they appear to rest on the most solid security,\r\nmay, nevertheless, be long delayed, and should not, consequently, be\r\ntaken into account in estimating the annual revenue. This article amounts\r\nto one million and six hundred thousand livres.\" Above all things, it is\r\ndesirable to hush the foreign officers by payment. Their wants, the nature\r\nof their services, their access to high characters, and connections with\r\nthem, bespeak the reasons for this. I hear also that Mr. Beaumarchais\r\nmeans to make himself heard, if a memorial which he sends by an agent in\r\nthe present packet is not attended to, as he thinks it ought to be. He\r\ncalled on me with it, and desired me to recommend his case to a decision,\r\nand to note in my despatch, that it was the first time he had spoken to me\r\non the subject. This is true, it being the first time I ever saw him; but\r\nmy recommendations would be as displaced as unnecessary. I assured him,\r\nCongress would do in that business, what justice should require, and their\r\nmeans enable them. The information sent me by Mr. Montgomery from Alicant,\r\nof the death of the Dey of Algiers, was not true. I had expressed my doubt\r\nof it in my last, when I communicated it. I send herewith the newspapers\r\nto this date, and a remonstrance of the parliament, to show you in what\r\nlanguage the King can be addressed at this day. I have received no journal\r\nof Congress since the beginning of November last, and will thank you for\r\nthem if printed.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. August 7. The parliament were received yesterday very harshly by the\r\nKing. He obliged them to register the two edicts for the impot-territorial\r\nand stamp tax. When speaking in my letter of the reiterated orders and\r\nrefusals to register, which passed between the King and parliament, I\r\nomitted to insert the King's answer to a deputation of parliament, which\r\nattended him at Versailles. It may serve to show the spirit which exists\r\nbetween them. It was in these words, and these only. \"Je vous ferai savoir\r\nmes intentions. Allez-vous-en. Qu'on ferme la porte.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR RUTLEDGE.\r\n\r\n                                                       PARIS, Aug. 6, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am honored with your letter by your son, and shall be happy\r\nto render him every assistance in my power of whatever nature. The objects\r\nof his stay in this country, and of his visit to London, are perfectly\r\nwell judged. So of that to Amsterdam. Perhaps it is questionable, whether\r\nthe time you propose he should spend at some of the German courts might\r\nnot be better employed at Madrid or Lisbon, and in Italy. At the former\r\nthere could be no object for him but politics, the system of which there\r\nis intricate, and can never be connected with us; nor will our commercial\r\nconnections be considerable. With Madrid and Lisbon our connections, both\r\npolitical and commercial, are great and will be increasing daily. Italy is\r\na field where the inhabitants of the Southern States may see much to copy\r\nin agriculture, and a country with which we shall carry on considerable\r\ntrade. Pardon my submitting these thoughts to you. We shall pursue your\r\nown plan unless you notify a change in it.\r\n\r\nThe present question in Europe is war or not war? I think there will be\r\nnone between the Emperor and his Brabantine subjects. But as to Holland,\r\nit is more doubtful, for we do not as yet consider the little partisan\r\naffairs which are taking place every day. France and England, conscious\r\nthat their exhausted means would poorly feed a war, have been strenuously\r\nexerting themselves to procure an accommodation. But the King of Prussia,\r\nin a moment of passion, has taken a measure which may defeat their wishes.\r\nOn receiving from the Princess of Orange, a letter informing him of her\r\nhaving been stopped on the road, without consulting the court of London,\r\nwithout saying a word to his own ministers, he issued orders himself to\r\nhis Generals to march twenty thousand men to be at her orders. England,\r\nunwilling to bring on a war, may yet fear to separate from him who is\r\nto be her main ally. Still, she is endeavoring, in concurrence with this\r\ncourt, to stop the effects of this hasty movement, and to bring about a\r\nsuspension of hostilities and settlement of difficulties, always meaning\r\nif they fail in this, to take the field in opposition to one another.\r\nBlessed effect of a kingly government, where a pretended insult to the\r\nsister of a king, is to produce the wanton sacrifice of a hundred or two\r\nthousand of the people who have entrusted themselves to his government,\r\nand as many of his enemies! and we think ours a bad government. The only\r\ncondition on earth to be compared with ours, in my opinion, is that of\r\nthe Indian, where they have still less law than we. The European, are\r\ngovernments of kites over pigeons. The best schools for republicanism are\r\nLondon, Versailles, Madrid, Vienna, Berlin, &c. Adieu, my dear Sir, and be\r\nassured of the sincere esteem of your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE CREVE-COEUR.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, August 6, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I was not a little disappointed to find on my return that you\r\nhad gone punctually in the packet as you had proposed. Great is the change\r\nin the dispositions of this country in the short time since you left it.\r\nA continuation of inconsiderate expense seemed to have raised the nation\r\nto the highest pitch of discontent. The parliament refused to register\r\nthe new taxes. After much and warm altercation, a _lit de justice_ has\r\nbeen held this day at Versailles; it was opened by the reading a severe\r\nremonstrance from the parliament, to which the King made a hard reply,\r\nand finished by ordering the stamp tax, and impot-territorial to be\r\nregistered. Your nation is advancing to a change of constitution; the\r\nyoung desire it, the middle aged are not averse, the old alone opposed to\r\nit. They will die, the provincial assemblies will chalk out the plan, and\r\nthe nation, ripening fast, will execute it. All your friends are in the\r\ncountry, so I can give you no news of them; but no news are always good\r\nnews. The Dutchess Danville is with some of her friends; the Duke and\r\nDutchess de La Rochefoucault gone to the waters; the Countess d'Houdelot\r\nwith Madame de La Britu. Your sons are well, and go on well, and we are\r\nlaboring here to improve on M. de Calonne's letter on our commerce. Adieu,\r\nmy dear Sir, and be assured of the sentiments of sincere esteem with which\r\nI am your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL RICHARD CLAIBORNE.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, August 8, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am of opinion that American tenants for western lands could not\r\nbe procured, and if they could, they would be very unsure. The best,\r\nas far as I have been able to judge, are foreigners, who do not speak\r\nthe language. Unable to communicate with the people of the country,\r\nthey confine themselves to their farms and their families, compare\r\ntheir present state to what it was in Europe, and find great reason to\r\nbe contented. Of all foreigners, I should prefer Germans. They are the\r\neasiest got, the best for their landlords, and do best for themselves. The\r\ndeed in which you were interested, having been sent to me the other day to\r\nbe authenticated, I took the enclosed note of its particulars for you. I\r\nam, with much esteem, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN CHURCHMAN.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, August 8, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your favor of June the 6th, and immediately\r\ncommunicated its contents to a member of the Academy. He told me that\r\nthey had received the other copy of your memorial, which you mention to\r\nhave sent through another channel; that your ideas were not conveyed so\r\nexplicitly, as to enable them to decide finally on their merit, but that\r\nthey had made an entry in their journals, to preserve to you the claim\r\nof the original idea. As far as we can conjecture it here, we imagine you\r\nmake a table of variations of the needle, for all the different meridians\r\nwhatever. To apply this table to use, in the voyage between America and\r\nEurope, suppose the variation to increase a degree in every one hundred\r\nand sixty miles. Two difficulties occur: 1, a ready and accurate method of\r\nfinding the variation of the place; 2, an instrument so perfect, as that\r\n(though the degree on it shall represent one hundred and sixty miles) it\r\nshall give the parts of the degree so minutely, as to answer the purpose\r\nof the navigator. The variation of the needle at Paris, actually, is 21\r\nwest. I make no question you have provided against the doubts entertained\r\nhere, and I shall be happy that our country may have the honor of\r\nfurnishing the old world what it has so long sought in vain. I am, with\r\nmuch respect, Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR L'HOMMANDE.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, August 9, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--At the time you honored me with your letter of May the 31st, I was\r\nnot returned from a journey I had taken into Italy. This circumstance,\r\nwith the mass of business which had accumulated during my absence, must\r\napologise for the delay of my answer. Every discovery which multiplies the\r\nsubsistence of man, must be a matter of joy to every friend to humanity.\r\nAs such, I learn with great satisfaction, that you have found the means\r\nof preserving flour more perfectly than has been done hitherto. But I am\r\nnot authorized to avail my country of it, by making any offer for its\r\ncommunication. Their policy is, to leave their citizens free, neither\r\nrestraining nor aiding them in their pursuits. Though the interposition of\r\ngovernment, in matters of invention, has its use, yet it is in practice\r\nso inseparable from abuse, that they think it better not to meddle with\r\nit. We are only to hope, therefore, that those governments who are in the\r\nhabit of directing all the actions of their subjects, by particular law,\r\nmay be so far sensible of the duty they are under of cultivating useful\r\ndiscoveries, as to reward you amply for yours, which is among the most\r\ninteresting to humanity. I have the honor to be, with great consideration\r\nand respect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PETER CARR.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, August 10, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR PETER,--I have received your two letters of December the 30th and\r\nApril the 18th, and am very happy to find by them, as well as by letters\r\nfrom Mr. Wythe, that you have been so fortunate as to attract his notice\r\nand good will; I am sure you will find this to have been one of the most\r\nfortunate events of your life, as I have ever been sensible it was of\r\nmine. I enclose you a sketch of the sciences to which I would wish you\r\nto apply, in such order as Mr. Wythe shall advise; I mention, also, the\r\nbooks in them worth your reading, which submit to his correction. Many\r\nof these are among your father's books, which you should have brought to\r\nyou. As I do not recollect those of them not in his library, you must\r\nwrite to me for them, making out a catalogue of such as you think you\r\nshall have occasion for, in eighteen months from the date of your letter,\r\nand consulting Mr. Wythe on the subject. To this sketch, I will add a few\r\nparticular observations:\r\n\r\n1. Italian. I fear the learning this language will confound your French\r\nand Spanish. Being all of them degenerated dialects of the Latin, they are\r\napt to mix in conversation. I have never seen a person speaking the three\r\nlanguages, who did not mix them. It is a delightful language, but late\r\nevents having rendered the Spanish more useful, lay it aside to prosecute\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n2. Spanish. Bestow great attention on this, and endeavor to acquire an\r\naccurate knowledge of it. Our future connections with Spain and Spanish\r\nAmerica, will render that language a valuable acquisition. The ancient\r\nhistory of that part of America, too, is written in that language. I send\r\nyou a dictionary.\r\n\r\n3. Moral Philosophy. I think it lost time to attend lectures on this\r\nbranch. He who made us would have been a pitiful bungler, if he had\r\nmade the rules of our moral conduct a matter of science. For one man of\r\nscience, there are thousands who are not. What would have become of them?\r\nMan was destined for society. His morality, therefore, was to be formed\r\nto this object. He was endowed with a sense of right and wrong, merely\r\nrelative to this. This sense is as much a part of his nature, as the sense\r\nof hearing, seeing, feeling; it is the true foundation of morality, and\r\nnot the το χαλον, truth, &c., as fanciful writers have imagined. The\r\nmoral sense, or conscience, is as much a part of man as his leg or arm. It\r\nis given to all human beings in a stronger or weaker degree, as force of\r\nmembers is given them in a greater or less degree. It may be strengthened\r\nby exercise, as may any particular limb of the body. This sense is\r\nsubmitted, indeed, in some degree, to the guidance of reason; but it is\r\na small stock which is required for this: even a less one than what we\r\ncall common sense. State a moral case to a ploughman and a professor. The\r\nformer will decide it as well, and often better than the latter, because\r\nhe has not been led astray by artificial rules. In this branch, therefore,\r\nread good books, because they will encourage, as well as direct your\r\nfeelings. The writings of Sterne, particularly, form the best course of\r\nmorality that ever was written. Besides these, read the books mentioned in\r\nthe enclosed paper; and, above all things, lose no occasion of exercising\r\nyour dispositions to be grateful, to be generous, to be charitable, to\r\nbe humane, to be true, just, firm, orderly, courageous, &c. Consider\r\nevery act of this kind, as an exercise which will strengthen your moral\r\nfaculties and increase your worth.\r\n\r\n4. Religion. Your reason is now mature enough to examine this object.\r\nIn the first place, divest yourself of all bias in favor of novelty and\r\nsingularity of opinion. Indulge them in any other subject rather than\r\nthat of religion. It is too important, and the consequences of error may\r\nbe too serious. On the other hand, shake off all the fears and servile\r\nprejudices, under which weak minds are servilely crouched. Fix reason\r\nfirmly in her seat, and call to her tribunal every fact, every opinion.\r\nQuestion with boldness even the existence of a God; because, if there\r\nbe one, he must more approve of the homage of reason, than that of\r\nblindfolded fear. You will naturally examine first, the religion of your\r\nown country. Read the Bible, then, as you would read Livy or Tacitus. The\r\nfacts which are within the ordinary course of nature, you will believe on\r\nthe authority of the writer, as you do those of the same kind in Livy and\r\nTacitus. The testimony of the writer weighs in their favor, in one scale,\r\nand their not being against the laws of nature, does not weigh against\r\nthem. But those facts in the Bible which contradict the laws of nature,\r\nmust be examined with more care, and under a variety of faces. Here you\r\nmust recur to the pretensions of the writer to inspiration from God.\r\nExamine upon what evidence his pretensions are founded, and whether that\r\nevidence is so strong, as that its falsehood would be more improbable than\r\na change in the laws of nature, in the case he relates. For example, in\r\nthe book of Joshua, we are told, the sun stood still several hours. Were\r\nwe to read that fact in Livy or Tacitus, we should class it with their\r\nshowers of blood, speaking of statues, beasts, &c. But it is said, that\r\nthe writer of that book was inspired. Examine, therefore, candidly, what\r\nevidence there is of his having been inspired. The pretension is entitled\r\nto your inquiry, because millions believe it. On the other hand, you are\r\nastronomer enough to know how contrary it is to the law of nature that\r\na body revolving on its axis, as the earth does, should have stopped,\r\nshould not, by that sudden stoppage, have prostrated animals, trees,\r\nbuildings, and should after a certain time have resumed its revolution,\r\nand that without a second general prostration. Is this arrest of the\r\nearth's motion, or the evidence which affirms it, most within the law of\r\nprobabilities? You will next read the New Testament. It is the history of\r\na personage called Jesus. Keep in your eye the opposite pretensions: 1,\r\nof those who say he was begotten by God, born of a virgin, suspended and\r\nreversed the laws of nature at will, and ascended bodily into heaven; and\r\n2, of those who say he was a man of illegitimate birth, of a benevolent\r\nheart, enthusiastic mind, who set out without pretensions to divinity,\r\nended in believing them, and was punished capitally for sedition, by being\r\ngibbeted, according to the Roman law, which punished the first commission\r\nof that offence by whipping, and the second by exile, or death _in furea_.\r\nSee this law in the Digest, Lib. 48. tit. 19. §. 28. 3. and Lipsius Lib.\r\n2. de cruce. cap. 2. These questions are examined in the books I have\r\nmentioned, under the head of Religion, and several others. They will\r\nassist you in your inquiries; but keep your reason firmly on the watch in\r\nreading them all. Do not be frightened from this inquiry by any fear of\r\nits consequences. If it ends in a belief that there is no God, you will\r\nfind incitements to virtue in the comfort and pleasantness you feel in its\r\nexercise, and the love of others which it will procure you. If you find\r\nreason to believe there is a God a consciousness that you are acting under\r\nhis eye, and that he approves you, will be a vast additional incitement;\r\nif that there be a future state, the hope of a happy existence in that\r\nincreases the appetite to deserve it; if that Jesus was also a God, you\r\nwill be comforted by a belief of his aid and love. In fine, I repeat,\r\nyou must lay aside all prejudice on both sides, and neither believe nor\r\nreject anything, because any other persons, or description of persons,\r\nhave rejected or believed it. Your own reason is the only oracle given you\r\nby heaven, and you are answerable, not for the rightness, but uprightness\r\nof the decision. I forgot to observe, when speaking of the New Testament,\r\nthat you should read all the histories of Christ, as well of those whom a\r\ncouncil of ecclesiastics have decided for us, to be Pseudo-evangelists,\r\nas those they named Evangelists. Because these Pseudo-evangelists\r\npretended to inspiration, as much as the others, and you are to judge\r\ntheir pretensions by your own reason, and not by the reason of those\r\necclesiastics. Most of these are lost. There are some, however, still\r\nextant, collected by Fabricius, which I will endeavor to get and send you.\r\n\r\n5. Travelling. This makes men wiser, but less happy. When men of sober\r\nage travel, they gather knowledge, which they may apply usefully for\r\ntheir country; but they are subject ever after to recollections mixed with\r\nregret; their affections are weakened by being extended over more objects;\r\nand they learn new habits which cannot be gratified when they return\r\nhome. Young men, who travel, are exposed to all these inconveniences in\r\na higher degree, to others still more serious, and do not acquire that\r\nwisdom for which a previous foundation is requisite, by repeated and just\r\nobservations at home. The glare of pomp and pleasure is analogous to\r\nthe motion of the blood; it absorbs all their affection and attention,\r\nthey are torn from it as from the only good in this world, and return\r\nto their home as to a place of exile and condemnation. Their eyes are\r\nforever turned back to the object they have lost, and its recollection\r\npoisons the residue of their lives. Their first and most delicate passions\r\nare hackneyed on unworthy objects here, and they carry home the dregs,\r\ninsufficient to make themselves or anybody else happy. Add to this, that\r\na habit of idleness, an inability to apply themselves to business is\r\nacquired, and renders them useless to themselves and their country. These\r\nobservations are founded in experience. There is no place where your\r\npursuit of knowledge will be so little obstructed by foreign objects, as\r\nin your own country, nor any, wherein the virtues of the heart will be\r\nless exposed to be weakened. Be good, be learned, and be industrious,\r\nand you will not want the aid of travelling, to render you precious to\r\nyour country, dear to your friends, happy within yourself. I repeat my\r\nadvice, to take a great deal of exercise, and on foot. Health is the\r\nfirst requisite after morality. Write to me often, and be assured of the\r\ninterest I take in your success, as well as the warmth of those sentiments\r\nof attachment with which I am, dear Peter, your affectionate friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. GILMER.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, August 11, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR DOCTOR,--Your letter of January the 9th, 1787, came safely to\r\nhand in the month of June last. Unluckily you forgot to sign it, and\r\nyour handwriting is so Protean, that one cannot be sure it is yours.\r\nTo increase the causes of incertitude, it was dated _Pen-park_, a name\r\nwhich I only know, as the seat of John Harmer. The hand-writing, too,\r\nbeing somewhat in his style, made me ascribe it hastily to him, indorse\r\nit with his name, and let it lie in my bundle to be answered at leisure.\r\nThat moment of leisure arriving, I set down to answer it to John Harmer,\r\nand now, for the first time, discover marks of its being yours, and\r\nparticularly those expressions of friendship to myself and family, which\r\nyou have ever been so good as to entertain, and which are to me among\r\nthe most precious possessions. I wish my sense of this, and my desires\r\nof seeing you rich and happy, may not prevent my seeing any difficulty in\r\nthe case you state of George Harmer's wills; which as you state them, are\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n1. A will, dated December the 26th, 1779, written in his own hand, and\r\ndevising to his brother the estates he had received from him.\r\n\r\n2. Another will, dated June the 25th, 1782, written also in his own hand,\r\ndevising his estate to trustees, to be conveyed to such of his relations.\r\nI. H. I. L. or H. L. as should become capable of acquiring property, or,\r\non failure of that, to be sold and the money remitted them.\r\n\r\n3. A third will, dated September the 12th, 1786, devising all his estate\r\nat Marrowbone, and his tracts at Horse-pasture and Poison-field to you;\r\nwhich will is admitted to record, and of course, has been duly executed.\r\n\r\nYou say the learned are divided on these wills. Yet I see no cause of\r\ndivision, as it requires little learning to decide, that \"the first deed\r\nand last will must always prevail.\" I am afraid, therefore, the difficulty\r\nmay arise on the want of words of inheritance in the devise to you; for\r\nyou state it as a devise to \"George Gilmer\" (without adding \"and to his\r\nheirs,\") of \"all the _estate_ called Marrowbone,\" \"the _tract_ called\r\nHorse-pasture,\" and \"the _tract_ called Poison-field.\" If the question\r\nis on this point, and you have copied the words of the will exactly, I\r\nsuppose you take an estate in fee simple in Marrowbone, and for life only\r\nin Horse-pasture and Poison-field; the want of words of inheritance in\r\nthe two last cases, being supplied as to the first, by the word \"estate,\"\r\nwhich has been repeatedly decided to be descriptive of the quantum of\r\ninterest devised, as well as of its locality. I am in hopes, however, you\r\nhave not copied the words exactly, that there are words of inheritance\r\nto all the devises, as the testator certainly knew their necessity, and\r\nthat the conflict only will be between the different wills, in which\r\ncase I see nothing which can be opposed to the last. I shall be very\r\nhappy to eat at Pen-park, some of the good mutton and beef of Marrowbone,\r\nHorse-pasture and Poison-field, with yourself and Mrs. Gilmer, and my\r\ngood old neighbors. I am as happy nowhere else, and in no other society,\r\nand all my wishes end, where I hope my days will end, at Monticello. Too\r\nmany scenes of happiness mingle themselves with all the recollections\r\nof my native woods and fields, to suffer them to be supplanted in my\r\naffection by any other. I consider myself here as a traveller only, and\r\nnot a resident. My commission expires next spring, and if not renewed, I\r\nshall, of course, return then. If renewed, I shall remain here some time\r\nlonger. How much, I cannot say; yet my wishes shorten the period. Among\r\nthe strongest inducements will be, that of your society and Mrs. Gilmer's,\r\nwhich I am glad to find brought more within reach, by your return to\r\nPen-park. My daughters are importunate to return also. Patsy enjoys good\r\nhealth, and is growing to my stature. Maria arrived here about a month\r\nago, after a favorable voyage, and in perfect health. My own health has\r\nbeen as good as ever, after the first year's probation. If you knew how\r\nagreeable to me are the details of the small news of my neighborhood, your\r\ncharity would induce you to write frequently. Your letters lodged in the\r\npost office at Richmond (to be forwarded to New York) come with certainty.\r\nWe are doubtful yet, whether there will be war or not. Present me with\r\nwarm affection to Mrs. Gilmer, and be assured yourself of the unvarying\r\nsentiments of esteem and attachment, with which I am, dear Doctor, your\r\nsincere friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL T. M. RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, August 11, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Mr. Ammonett sent me your favor of May 7, which you expected he\r\nwould have brought. He furnished me with the name of the family to whose\r\nproperty he supposes himself entitled, and the name of the town where it\r\nlies. I have endeavored to have them searched out, but as yet neither\r\nfamily nor town is discovered. If they can be found, the estate will\r\nthen be to be searched for; the laws for limitation of actions will form\r\nthe next opposition to him, and probably the laws of forfeiture against\r\nthe Protestants, who were the subject of the revocation of the edict of\r\nNantes, which laws have never been repealed, nor probably ever will be,\r\neven should the future condition of Protestants here be mitigated. I shall\r\nproceed in the enquiry for him, and let him know the result.\r\n\r\nYour son Thomas, at Edinburgh, has done me the favor to open a little\r\ncorrespondence with me. He has sometimes asked my advice as to the course\r\nof his studies, which I have given to him the more freely as he informed\r\nme he was not tied down to any particular plan by your instructions. He\r\ninformed me in his last letter that you proposed he should come to Paris\r\nthis fall, stay here the winter, and return to Virginia in the spring.\r\nI understand him as proposing to study the law, so that probably, on his\r\nreturn, you will place him at Williamsburg for that purpose. On this view\r\nof his destination I venture to propose to you another plan. The law may\r\nbe studied as well in one place as another; because it is a study of books\r\nalone, at least till near the close of it. Books can be read equally well\r\nat Williamsburg, at London, or Paris. The study of the law is an affair of\r\nthree years, the last of which should be spent in attending Mr. Wythe's\r\nlectures. Upon the plan he has now in expectation, his residence here\r\nsix months as a traveller, must cost him two hundred guineas, and three\r\nyears' study at Williamsburg, four hundred and fifty guineas more, making\r\nfive hundred and fifty guineas in the whole. My proposition is that he\r\nshall pass his two first years of legal study in some one of the villages\r\nwithin an hour's walk of Paris, boarded with some good family, wherein he\r\nmay learn to speak the language, which is not to be learned in any other\r\nway. By this means he will avoid the loss of time and money which would\r\nbe the consequence of a residence in the town, and he will be nigh enough\r\nto come to dine, to make acquaintances, see good company, and examine the\r\nuseful details of the city. With very great economy he may do this on one\r\nhundred guineas a year, but at his ease for one hundred and fifty guineas.\r\nAt the end of two years I would propose him a journey through the southern\r\nparts of France, thence to Genoa, Leghorn, Florence, Rome, Naples, Venice,\r\nMilan, Turin, Geneva, Lyons and Paris. This will employ him seven months,\r\nand cost him three hundred and thirty guineas, if he goes alone, or\r\ntwo hundred and thirty guineas if he finds a companion. Then he should\r\nreturn to Virginia, and pass his third year of legal study in attending\r\nMr. Wythe's lectures. This whole plan would take three years and seven\r\nmonths, and cost from seven hundred to seven hundred and fifty guineas,\r\nwhich would be one month longer, and one hundred and fifty or two hundred\r\nguineas dearer than the one proposed. The advantages of this would be his\r\nlearning to speak French well, his acquiring a better acquaintance here\r\nwith men and things, and his having travelled through the most interesting\r\nparts of Europe, advantages which he will forever think cheaply purchased\r\nfor one hundred and fifty or two hundred guineas, even were a deduction\r\nof that sum to be made from the establishment you mean to give him. But in\r\nevery case, whether you decide that he shall return to study in Virginia,\r\nor remain here for that purpose, I would recommend that he should not be\r\ntied down to quit Edinburgh this fall precisely, but only when he shall\r\nhave finished his courses of lectures in those sciences with which he\r\nshould not be unacquainted. I have taken the liberty of noting these to\r\nhim. I perceive by his letters that he has a good genius, and everybody\r\nbears witness to his application, which is almost too great. It would be\r\na pity, therefore, he should miss of giving them full encouragement. I\r\nmust beg your pardon for thus intruding myself into a business belonging\r\nto yourself alone, and hope you will find its excuse in the motives from\r\nwhich it proceeds, friendship for yourself, Mrs. Randolph and your son.\r\nI wish to see you gratified, and to be gratified myself in seeing him\r\nact the advantageous part, which will naturally result from his talents,\r\nhis merit, and the favorable ground from which he will start; a fear of\r\nseeing this endangered by a too early return to our own country where the\r\nexample of his cotemporaries may soon possibly lead him from the regular\r\npursuits his friends may chalk out for him, all these considerations have\r\nimpelled me to take this liberty, and to rely for pardon on the assurance\r\nof the sincere attachment and respect with which I am, dear Sir, your\r\naffectionate friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE REVEREND J. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, August 13, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have been long, very long, without answering your favor of\r\nMarch 27, 1786, and since that I have received those of December 28, and\r\nby Mrs. Oster. The reason of this has been that the genius of invention\r\nand improvement in Europe seems to be absolutely taking a nap. We have\r\nnothing to communicate to you but of the small kind, such as making the\r\naxletree turn with the wheel, which has been proposed here, adopted\r\nby some, and thought to be proved best by experiment, though theory\r\nhas nothing to urge in its favor. A hydrostatic waistcoat is lately\r\nannounced, which a person puts on either above or below his clothes in a\r\nminute, and fills with air by blowing with the mouth in twelve seconds.\r\nIt is not yet shown, however, so I cannot tell you either the manner or\r\nmatter of its construction. It may be useful when the loss of a vessel is\r\nforeseen. Herschell's discovery of two satellites to his planet, you have\r\nheard of ere this. He first saw them in January last. One revolves round\r\nits principal in about a week; the other in about a fortnight. I think\r\nyour conjecture that the periodical variation of light in certain fixed\r\nstars proceeds from Maculæ, is more probable than that of Maupertius,\r\nwho supposes those bodies may be flat, and more probable also than that\r\nwhich supposes the star to have an orbit of revolution so large as to\r\nvary sensibly its degree of light. The latter is rendered more difficult\r\nof belief from the shortness of the period of variation. I thank you\r\nfor the shells you sent me. Their identity with marine shells and their\r\nvicinity to the sea, argue an identity of cause. But still the shells\r\nfound in the mountains are very imperfectly accounted for. I have lately\r\nbecome acquainted with a memoire on a petrification mixed with shells by\r\na Monsieur de La Sauvagere, giving an exact account of what Voltaire had\r\nerroneously stated in his questions Encyclopediques, article Coquilles,\r\nfrom whence I had transferred it into my notes. Having been lately at\r\nTours, I had an opportunity of enquiring into de La Sauvagere's character,\r\nand the facts he states. The result was entirely in his and their favor.\r\nThis fact is so curious, so circumstantially detailed, and yet so little\r\nlike any known operation of nature, that it throws the mind under absolute\r\nsuspense. The memoir is out of print. But my bookseller is now in search\r\nof it, and if he can find it I will put a copy of it into a box of books\r\nI shall send by the September packet, addressed to Mr. Wythe. In the same\r\nbox I will put for you the Bibliotheque Physico-economique, for 1786,\r\n1787, the connoissance des tems, Fourcroy's Chemistry, wherein all the\r\nlater discoveries are digested, and a number of my notes on Virginia, of\r\na copy of which you will be pleased to accept. It is a poor crayon, which\r\nyourself and the gentlemen which issue from your school must fill up.\r\nWe are doubtful here whether we are to have peace or war. The movements\r\nof Prussia and England indicate war; the finances of England and France\r\nindicate peace. I think the two last will endeavor to accommodate the\r\nDutch differences. Be pleased to present me respectfully to Mrs. Madison,\r\nand after repeating the recommendation of my nephew to you, I take the\r\nliberty of assuring you of that esteem with which I am, dear Sir, your\r\nfriend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE J. BLAIR.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, August 13, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received the letter with which you were pleased to honor me,\r\nby Mrs. Oster, and immediately waited on her with a tender of my services.\r\nShe had, however, so far got her matters arranged as to be no longer in\r\nfear of any disagreeable measure, and is since gone to establish herself\r\nwith her friends in Lorraine. I wish she may not there have alarms of a\r\ndifferent nature. We have hitherto been in hopes that the desperate state\r\nof the finances of France and England would indispose those powers to war,\r\nand induce them, by an armed mediation, to quiet the affairs of Holland.\r\nThe actual march, however, of the Prussian troops, the departure of the\r\nBritish squadron somewhere westwardly, and the preparations for a naval\r\narmament at Brest, and a land one in the neighborhood of the Netherlands,\r\nrender war at present more expected than it has been. Still we look to\r\nthe necessities of the two principal powers as promising efficacy to\r\nthe negotiations not yet broken off. Though we shall be neutrals, and\r\nas such shall derive considerable pecuniary advantages, yet I think we\r\nshall lose in happiness and morals by being launched again into the\r\nocean of speculation, led to overtrade ourselves, tempted to become\r\nsea-robbers under French colors, and to quit the pursuits of agriculture,\r\nthe surest road to affluence and best preservative of morals. Perhaps,\r\ntoo, it may divert the attention of the States from those great political\r\nimprovements, which the honorable body, of which you are a member, will,\r\nI hope, propose to them. What these may be, I know not, but I am sure they\r\nwill be what they should be. My idea is that we should be made one nation\r\nin every case concerning foreign affairs, and separate ones in whatever\r\nis merely domestic; that the Federal government should be organized into\r\nLegislative, Executive and Judiciary, as are the State governments, and\r\nsome peaceable means of enforcement devised for the Federal head over the\r\nStates. But of all these things you are a better judge. I have delivered\r\nyour message to Mr. Mazzei, who is still here. Be so good as to present me\r\nrespectfully to Mrs. Blair, and to be assured yourself of the sentiments\r\nof esteem and respect with which I have the honor to be, dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH JONES.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, August 14, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have never yet thanked you, but with the heart, for the\r\nact of Assembly confirming the agreement with Maryland, the pamphlet\r\nand papers I received from you a twelve month ago. Very soon after their\r\nreceipt, I got my right wrist dislocated, which prevented me long from\r\nwriting, and as soon as that was able to bear it, I took a long journey,\r\nfrom which I am but lately returned. I am anxious to hear what our federal\r\nconvention recommends, and what the States will do in consequence of their\r\nrecommendation. * * * * With all the defects of our constitution, whether\r\ngeneral or particular, the comparison of our governments with those of\r\nEurope, is like a comparison of heaven and hell. England, like the earth,\r\nmay be allowed to take the intermediate station. And yet, I hear there are\r\npeople among you, who think the experience of our governments has already\r\nproved, that republican governments will not answer. Send those gentry\r\nhere, to count the blessings of monarchy. A king's sister, for instance,\r\nstopped on the road, and on a hostile journey, is sufficient cause for him\r\nto march immediately twenty thousand men to revenge this insult, when he\r\nhad shown himself little moved by the matter of right then in question.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom all these broils we are happily free, and that God may keep us long\r\nso, and yourself in health and happiness, is the prayer of, dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, August 14, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am happy to find, by the letter of August the 1st, 1786,\r\nwhich you did me the honor to write to me, that the modern dress for your\r\nstatue would meet your approbation. I found it strongly the sentiment\r\nof West, Copley, Trumbull, and Brown, in London: after which, it would\r\nbe ridiculous to add, that it was my own. I think a modern in an antique\r\ndress as just an object of ridicule as a Hercules or Marius with a periwig\r\nand a chapeau bras.\r\n\r\nI remember having written to you, while Congress sat at Annapolis, on\r\nthe water communication between ours and the western country, and to have\r\nmentioned particularly the information I had received of the plain face\r\nof the country between the sources of Big Beaver and Cayohoga, which made\r\nme hope that a canal of no great expense might unite the navigation of\r\nLake Erie and the Ohio. You must since have had occasion of getting better\r\ninformation on this subject, and if you have, you would oblige me by a\r\ncommunication of it. I consider this canal, if practicable, as a very\r\nimportant work.\r\n\r\nI remain in hopes of great and good effects from the decision of the\r\nAssembly over which you are presiding. To make our States one as to all\r\nforeign concerns, preserve them several as to all merely domestic, to give\r\nto the federal head some peaceable mode of enforcing its just authority,\r\nto organize that head into legislative, executive, and judiciary\r\napartments, are great desiderata in our federal constitution. Yet with\r\nall its defects, and with all those of our particular governments, the\r\ninconveniences resulting from them, are so light in comparison with\r\nthose existing in every other government on earth, that our citizens\r\nmay certainly be considered as in the happiest political situation which\r\nexists.\r\n\r\nThe Assemblée des Notables has been productive of much good in this\r\ncountry. The reformation of some of the most oppressive laws has taken\r\nplace, and is taking place. The allotment of the State into subordinate\r\ngovernments, the administration of which is committed to persons\r\nchosen by the people, will work in time a very beneficial change in\r\ntheir constitution. The expense of the trappings of monarchy, too, is\r\nlightening. Many of the useless officers, high and low, of the King,\r\nQueen, and Princes, are struck off. Notwithstanding all this, the\r\ndiscovery of the abominable abuses of public money by the late Comptroller\r\nGeneral, some new expenses of the court, not of a piece with the projects\r\nof reformation, and the imposition of new taxes, have, in the course\r\nof a few weeks, raised a spirit of discontent in this nation, so great\r\nand so general, as to threaten serious consequences. The parliaments\r\nin general, and particularly that of Paris, put themselves at the head\r\nof this effervescence, and direct its object to the calling the States\r\nGeneral, who have not been assembled since 1614. The object is to fix a\r\nconstitution, and to limit expenses. The King has been obliged to hold a\r\nbed of justice, to enforce the registering the new taxes; the parliament,\r\non their side, propose to issue a prohibition against their execution.\r\nVery possibly this may bring on their exile. The mild and patriotic\r\ncharacter of the new ministry, is the principal dependence against this\r\nextremity.\r\n\r\nThe turn which the affairs of Europe will take, is not yet decided.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA war, wherein France, Holland, and England should be parties, seems,\r\n_prima facie_, to promise much advantage to us. But in the first place,\r\nno war can be safe for us which threatens France with an unfavorable\r\nissue; and in the next, it will probably embark us again into the ocean\r\nof speculation, engage us to over-trade ourselves, convert us into\r\nsea-rovers, under French and Dutch colors, divert us from agriculture,\r\nwhich is our wisest pursuit, because it will in the end contribute\r\nmost to real wealth, good morals, and happiness. The wealth acquired by\r\nspeculation and plunder, is fugacious in its nature, and fills society\r\nwith the spirit of gambling. The moderate and sure income of husbandry\r\nbegets permanent improvement, quiet life, and orderly conduct, both\r\npublic and private. We have no occasion for more commerce than to take off\r\nour superfluous produce, and the people complain that some restrictions\r\nprevent this; yet the price of articles with us, in general, shows the\r\ncontrary. Tobacco, indeed, is low, not because we cannot carry it where\r\nwe please, but because we make more than the consumption requires. Upon\r\nthe whole, I think peace advantageous to us, necessary for Europe, and\r\ndesirable for humanity. A few days will decide, probably, whether all\r\nthese considerations are to give way to the bad passions of Kings, and\r\nthose who would be Kings.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with very sincere esteem and respect, dear Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. August 15. The parliament is exiled to Troyes this morning.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL HUMPHREYS.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, August 14, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I remember when you left us, it was with a promise to\r\nsupply all the defects of correspondence with our friends, of which we\r\ncomplained, and which you had felt in common with us. Yet I have received\r\nbut one letter from you, which was dated June the 5th, 1786, and I\r\nanswered it, August the 14th, 1786. Dropping that, however, and beginning\r\na new account, I will observe to you, that wonderful improvements are\r\nmaking here in various lines. In architecture, the wall of circumvallation\r\nround Paris, and the palaces by which we are to be let out and in, are\r\nnearly completed; four hospitals are to be built instead of the old\r\nHotel-Dieu; one of the old bridges has all its houses demolished, and\r\na second nearly so; a new bridge is begun at the Place Louis XV.; the\r\nPalais Royale is gutted, a considerable part in the centre of the garden\r\nbeing dug out, and a subterranean circus begun, wherein will be equestrian\r\nexhibitions, &c. In society, the habit habillé is almost banished, and\r\nthey begin to go even to great suppers in frock: the court and diplomatic\r\ncorps, however, must always be excepted. They are too high to be reached\r\nby any improvement. They are the last refuge from which etiquette,\r\nformality, and folly will be driven. Take away these, and they would be on\r\na level with other people.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[After describing the unsettled state of Europe, as in some of the\r\npreceding letters, the writer proceeds:]\r\n\r\nSo much for the blessings of having Kings, and magistrates who would be\r\nKings. From these events, our young Republic may learn useful lessons,\r\nnever to call on foreign powers to settle their differences, to guard\r\nagainst hereditary magistrates, to prevent their citizens from becoming\r\nso established in wealth and power, as to be thought worthy of alliance\r\nby marriage with the nieces, sisters, &c., of Kings, and, in short, to\r\nbesiege the throne of heaven with eternal prayers, to extirpate from\r\ncreation this class of human lions, tigers, and mammoths called Kings;\r\nfrom whom, let him perish who does not say, \"good Lord deliver us;\" and\r\nthat so we may say, one and all, or perish, is the fervent prayer of\r\nhim who has the honor to mix with it, sincere wishes for your health and\r\nhappiness, and to be, with real attachment and respect, dear Sir, your\r\naffectionate friend and humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, August 15, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--An American gentleman leaving Paris this afternoon to go by the way\r\nof L'Orient to Boston, furnishes me the rare occasion of a conveyance,\r\nother than the packet, sure and quick. My letter by the packet informed\r\nyou of the bed of justice, for enregistering the stamp tax and land tax.\r\nThe parliament, on their return, came to an _Arretee_ (a resolution)\r\nwhich, besides protesting against the enregistering, as done by force,\r\nlaid the foundation for an _Arret de defence_ (an act) against the\r\nexecution of the two new laws. The question on the final _Arret_ was\r\nadjourned to the day before yesterday. It is believed they did not\r\nconclude on this _Arret_, as it has not appeared. However, there was a\r\nconcourse of about ten thousand people at the parliament house, who, on\r\ntheir adjournment, received them with acclamations of joy, loosened the\r\nhorses of the most eminent speakers against the tax from their carriages,\r\nand drew them home. This morning, the parliament is exiled to Troyes. It\r\nis believed to proceed, principally, from the fear of a popular commotion\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nThe officer, charged by this court to watch the English squadron, which\r\nwas under sailing orders, returned about a week ago, with information\r\nthat it had sailed, having shaped its course westwardly. This is another\r\nstep towards war. It is the more suspicious, as their minister here denies\r\nthe fact. Count Adhemar is here from London, by leave from his court. The\r\nDuke of Dorset, the British ambassador here, has lately gone to London\r\non leave. Neither of these ambassadors has the confidence of his court,\r\non the point of abilities. The latter merits it for his honesty. The\r\nminister of the British court, resident here, remains; but Mr. Eden, their\r\nambassador to Spain, under pretence of taking this in his route, is in\r\ntruth their _factotum_ in the present emergency. Nothing worth noting has\r\noccurred since my last, either in the Dutch or Austrian Netherlands.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, August 15, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--A gentleman going from hence by L'Orient to Boston, furnishes\r\nme an opportunity of recommending to your care the enclosed letters,\r\nwhich I could not get ready for the last packet. Pray inform me in your\r\nnext whether letters directed to your foreign ministers, or franked by\r\nthem, are free of postage; that they ought to be so is acknowledged\r\nsubstantially by the resolution of Congress, allowing us to charge\r\npostages. I have sometimes suspected that my letters stagnate in the\r\npost-offices. My letters by the last packet brought down the domestic\r\nnews of this country to the day in which the bed of justice was held. The\r\nday before yesterday the parliament house was surrounded by ten thousand\r\npeople, who received them on their adjournment with acclamations of joy,\r\ntook out the horses of the principal speakers and drew their chariots\r\nthemselves to their hotels. The parliament not having taken the desperate\r\nstep (as far as is yet known) of forbidding the execution of the new tax\r\nlaws by an _Arret de defence sur peine de mort_, we presume it is the fear\r\nof a popular commotion which has occasioned the King to exile them to\r\nTroyes. This is known only this morning. The ministry here have certain\r\ninformation that the English squadron has sailed and took its course\r\nwestwardly. This is another move towards war. No other important fact has\r\ntaken place since my letter by the packet. Adieu. Yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DEL VERMI.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, August 15, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In consequence of the permission you were so kind as to give me,\r\nwhen I had the honor of seeing you at Milan, I shall sometimes take\r\nthe liberty of troubling you with a line. I cannot begin with an act of\r\ngreater justice than that of expressing to you all my gratitude for your\r\nattentions and services while in your capital, and to which I am indebted\r\nfor the best informations I received there. I then mentioned some late\r\npublications on the subject of America, of which I would do myself the\r\nhonor of sending you one, because it was my own, and two others because\r\nworth reading. Mine are some notes only on the State of Virginia. The\r\nothers are Ramsay's history of the war and Soulé's history. The first\r\nis very authentic, there being no fact in it which may not be relied\r\non; but it is confined to the war in the southern States. The last is a\r\ngeneral history, of which we can only say it is the best of those written\r\nin Europe. There is a history of the same period now printing in London,\r\nthough written in America by an English clergyman of the name of Gordon.\r\nHe had access to some collections of papers not known to any other writer.\r\nBut I am unable to say as yet what may be the merit of his work. You must\r\nhave observed when in America, that time and trial had discovered defects\r\nin our federal constitution. A new essay, made in the midst of the flames\r\nof war, could not be perfect. The States have appointed deputies, who\r\nare now sitting at Philadelphia, to consider what are the defects, and\r\nto propose new articles to be added to the instrument of confederation\r\nfor amending them. The articles to be proposed by them will have to be\r\nconfirmed by Congress and by the Legislature of every State before they\r\nwill be in force. As yet their proceedings are not known. Probably they\r\ngo to the following points: 1. To invest Congress with the exclusive\r\nsovereignty in every matter relative to foreign nations and the general\r\nmass of our Union, retaining to the States their individual sovereignty in\r\nmatters merely domestic. 2. To devise some peaceable mode whereby Congress\r\nmay enforce their decisions. 3. To organize Congress into three branches,\r\nLegislative, Executive and Judiciary. I had the honor of informing you of\r\nthe commotions which had taken place in Massachusetts, the only ones which\r\nhad ever taken place since the declaration of Independence. I have now\r\nthat of informing you that those commotions have been entirely quieted.\r\nGeneral Washington is well, and is president of the federal convention\r\nsitting at Philadelphia, as before mentioned. Dr. Franklin and others,\r\nthe greatest characters of America, are members of it. I do not give you\r\nEuropean news; you have that from other quarters; after adding therefore,\r\nthat the books before mentioned, are delivered to Messieurs Cathalan,\r\nof Marseilles, who will send them to their correspondent at Genoa, with\r\ninstructions to forward them to you at Milan. I shall only repeat very\r\nsincere assurances of the esteem and respect with which I have the honor\r\nto be, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, August 30, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Since your favor of July the 10th, mine have been of July the\r\n17th, 23d and 28th. The last enclosed a bill of exchange from Mr. Grand,\r\non Tessier, for £46, 17s. 10d. sterling, to answer General Sullivan's bill\r\nfor that sum. I hope it got safe to hand, though I have been anxious about\r\nit, as it went by post, and my letters through that channel sometimes\r\nmiscarry.\r\n\r\nFrom the separation of the Notables to the present moment, has been\r\nperhaps the most interesting interval ever known in this country. The\r\npropositions of the government, approved by the Notables, were precious\r\nto the nation, and have been in an honest course of execution, some of\r\nthem being carried into effect, and others preparing. Above all, the\r\nestablishment of the Provincial Assemblies, some of which have begun their\r\nsessions, bid fair to be the instrument for circumscribing the power of\r\nthe crown, and raising the people into consideration. The election given\r\nto them, is what will do this. Though the minister, who proposed these\r\nimprovements, seems to have meant them as the price of the new supplies,\r\nthe game has been so played, as to secure the improvements to the nation,\r\nwithout securing the price. The Notables spoke softly on the subject\r\nof the additional supplies. But the parliament took them up roundly,\r\nrefused to register the edicts for the new taxes, till compelled in a\r\nbed of justice, and suffered themselves to be transferred to Troyes,\r\nrather than withdraw their opposition. It is urged principally against\r\nthe King, that his revenue is one hundred and thirty millions more than\r\nthat of his predecessor was, and yet he demands one hundred and twenty\r\nmillions further. You will see this well explained in the \"Conference\r\nentre un ministre d'etat et un Conseiller au parliment,\" which I send you,\r\nwith some small pamphlets. In the meantime, all tongues in Paris (and\r\nin France as it is said) have been let loose, and never was a license\r\nof speaking against the government exercised in London more freely or\r\nmore universally. Caricatures, placards, bons mots, have been indulged\r\nin by all ranks of people, and I know of no well-attested instance of a\r\nsingle punishment. For sometime mobs of ten, twenty and thirty thousand\r\npeople collected daily, surrounded the parliament house, huzzaed the\r\nmembers, even entered the doors and examined into their conduct, took the\r\nhorses out of the carriages of those who did well, and drew them home.\r\nThe government thought it prudent to prevent these, drew some regiments\r\ninto the neighborhood, multiplied the guards, had the streets constantly\r\npatrolled by strong parties, suspended privileged places, forbade all\r\nclubs, &c. The mobs have ceased; perhaps this may be partly owing to\r\nthe absence of parliament. The Count d'Artois, sent to hold a bed of\r\njustice in the Cour des Aides, was hissed and hooted without reserve,\r\nby the populace; the carriage of Madame de (I forget the name) in the\r\nQueen's livery was stopped by the populace, under a belief that it was\r\nMadame de Polignac, whom they would have insulted; the Queen, going to\r\nthe theatre at Versailles with Madame de Polignac, was received with\r\na general hiss. The King, long in the habit of drowning his cares in\r\nwine, plunges deeper and deeper. The Queen cries, but sins on. The Count\r\nd'Artois is detested, and Monsieur, the general favorite. The Archbishop\r\nof Thoulouse is made minister principal, a virtuous, patriotic, and able\r\ncharacter. The Marechal de Castries retired yesterday, notwithstanding\r\nstrong solicitations to remain in office. The Marechal de Segur retired\r\nat the same time, prompted to it by the court. Their successors are not\r\nyet known. Monsieur de St. Priest goes ambassador to Holland, in the room\r\nof Verac, transferred to Switzerland, and the Count de Moustier goes to\r\nAmerica, in the room of the Chevalier de La Luzerne, who has a promise\r\nof the first vacancy. These nominations are not yet made formally, but\r\nthey are decided on, and the parties are ordered to prepare for their\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\nAs it has been long since I have had a confidential conveyance to you,\r\nI have brought together the principal facts from the adjournment of the\r\nNotables to the present moment, which, as you will perceive from their\r\nnature, required a confidential conveyance. I have done it the rather,\r\nbecause, though you will have heard many of them, and seen them in the\r\npublic papers, yet, floating in the mass of lies which constitute the\r\natmosphere of London and Paris, you may not have been sure of their truth;\r\nand I have mentioned every truth of any consequence, to enable you to\r\nstamp as false, the facts pretermitted. I think that in the course of\r\nthree months, the royal authority has lost, and the rights of the nation\r\ngained, as much ground by a revolution of public opinion only, as England\r\ngained in all her civil wars under the Stuarts. I rather believe, too,\r\nthey will retain the ground gained, because it is defended by the young\r\nand the middle aged, in opposition to the old only. The first party\r\nincreases, and the latter diminishes daily, from the course of nature. You\r\nmay suppose, that in this situation, war would be unwelcome to France. She\r\nwill surely avoid it, if not forced into it by the courts of London and\r\nBerlin. If forced, it is probable she will change the system of Europe\r\ntotally, by an alliance with the two empires, to whom nothing would be\r\nmore desirable. In the event of such a coalition, not only Prussia, but\r\nthe whole European world must receive from them their laws. But France\r\nwill probably endeavor to preserve the present system, if it can be done,\r\nby sacrificing to a certain degree, the pretensions of the Patriotic party\r\nin Holland. But of all these matters, you can judge, in your position,\r\nwhere less secrecy is observed, better than I can.\r\n\r\nI have news from America as late as July the 19th. Nothing had transpired\r\nfrom the federal convention. I am sorry they began their deliberations\r\nby so abominable a precedent as that of tying up the tongues of their\r\nmembers. Nothing can justify this example but the innocence of their\r\nintentions, and ignorance of the value of public discussions. I have no\r\ndoubt that all their other measures will be good and wise. It is really an\r\nassembly of demigods. General Washington was of opinion, that they should\r\nnot separate till October.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with every sentiment of friendship and respect,\r\ndear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. LE COMTE DE MONTMORIN.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, September 8, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I had the honor of addressing your Excellency on the 3d of July,\r\nsome observations on the letter of Monsieur de Calonnes, of October\r\n22d, 1786, relative to the commerce of France with the United States of\r\nAmerica; of proposing to it some small amendments, and of expressing a\r\nwish that it might be put into such a form as would secure its execution.\r\nMonsieur de Villedeuil, then Comptroller general was pleased to inform\r\nme that the Farmers General had received orders on the first of April,\r\n1787, to conform themselves to the decisions notified in that letter, and\r\nthat on the 5th of the same month they had given orders not to levy \"sur\r\nles _huiles_ et autres produits de la _peche Americane_ que les droits\r\nmentionnes dans la lettre.\" This expression, restrained to the produce\r\nof the _fisheries_, with recent information received from the American\r\nagent at Havre, make me apprehensive that the ancient duties are still\r\ndemanded on all other objects, and induce me to repeat to your Excellency\r\nmy request that the letter of M. de Calonnes may be put into such form\r\nas will insure its execution and stability. In my letter of July 25th,\r\nI took the liberty of proposing that timely measures might be adopted\r\nfor encouraging the direct importation of the tobacco of the United\r\nStates into this Kingdom when the order of Bernis should be expired,\r\nand that in the meantime that order might be strictly executed. A great\r\naccumulation of tobaccos in the seaports of France, and a refusal of\r\nthe Farmers General to purchase any more, on the pretence that they have\r\npurchased the whole quantity required by government, excites discontent\r\namong the merchants. It is their opinion that the Farms have not complied\r\nwith the order of Bernis. As the government was pleased to desire the\r\npublication of that order to induce the merchants to bring tobaccos here,\r\nit would be very satisfactory to make known also the execution of that\r\norder. If the Farms can verify that they have strictly executed it, all\r\ndiscontent will cease and the merchants become sensible that the present\r\nglut is occasioned by their importing too much. On the other hand, if\r\nit shall appear, from the list of purchases made by the Farms, or from\r\nother evidence, that they have not purchased the whole quantity on the\r\nconditions prescribed by government, they will doubtless be instructed to\r\ndo it, and that too without delay, as the duration of the contract with\r\nMr. Morris, and of the order of Bernis, formed on that, will soon expire.\r\n\r\nA parcel of gazettes and magazines sent to me from America, for my own\r\nuse, and detained in the syndic chamber, obliges me to trouble your\r\nExcellency for an order for their delivery.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, your Excellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. LIMOSIN.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, Sept. 9, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Immediately on the receipt of your favor of the 31st of August,\r\nI waited on the person who is charged with the superintendence of the\r\nconduct of the Farms, and informed him that the custom-house officers had\r\nrequired the ancient duties on a cargo of pearlash, arrived at Havre.\r\nHe observed to me that the duties promised to be abolished by the King\r\nwere only those due to himself or the Farms; but that there were _droits\r\nloceaux_, which he could not abolish; that the officers of the customs\r\nmight have demanded the droits loceaux, but that it was impossible they\r\nshould have demanded any other duties. If they have done so, I will beg\r\nthe favor of you to send me such evidence of the demand as will enable\r\nme to press for a proper notice of the Farms, if they have failed to give\r\norders, or a punishment of the officer, if he has failed to obey them.\r\n\r\nNo further changes in the government since my last. The office of\r\nDirecteur du tresor royal was offered to M. de La Borde and refused by\r\nhim. Had no accident intervened, I think the affairs of the Dutch would\r\nhave been arranged without producing any war immediately. They are even\r\nat this moment in a train of negotiation. But, in the meantime, a war\r\nhas broke out between the Russians and Turks. We have no news yet of\r\nany action, but the Turks have imprisoned the Russian Ambassador at\r\nConstantinople, and no hope is entertained of preventing hostilities.\r\nConsidering the situation of things in Europe, it seems inevitable that\r\nthis fire must spread over the whole of it. The utmost that can be hoped,\r\nin my opinion, is that the season is so far advanced as that the other\r\npowers of Europe may not be drawn into the vortex of hostilities till\r\nthe ensuing spring. The desire of government to prevent a war, might make\r\nit disagreeable to them to see this opinion published. I will pray you,\r\ntherefore, to make use of it only for your own government, and that of\r\nthe Americans concerned in commerce with your port. I shall make the same\r\ncommunication to our agents at Nantes and Bordeaux. I have the honor to\r\nbe, with much esteem, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. T. BLAKE.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, Sept. 9, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Congress do not grant their sea-letters for the East Indies,\r\nbut to ships belonging to citizens of the United States, and navigated\r\nby officers and seamen of the United States. Even the cargo must also\r\nbelong to their own citizens. Nor can these letters be obtained but on an\r\napplication to Congress themselves, whereupon they appoint a committee of\r\ntheir own body to enquire into the circumstances relative to the vessel,\r\ncargo and crew, and on their report of the fact, they grant or refuse the\r\npassport.\r\n\r\nI am, with much respect, Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BONDFIELD.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, September 9, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The affairs of Holland, though at one moment they had threatened a\r\nwar, had got into a hopeful train of accommodation, when all of a sudden a\r\nwar is kindled between the Russians and Turks. The latter have imprisoned\r\nthe Russian Ambassador resident with them, which you know is their manner\r\nof declaring war; and though no news of actual hostilities is yet arrived,\r\nevery body considers them as inevitable. In the present state of Europe,\r\na spark dropped anywhere must kindle the whole. The only thing to be\r\nhoped is that the advance of the season may prevent the other powers from\r\nbeing drawn into the vortex of hostilities, till the next spring. But this\r\ncannot be depended on. Government here would still wish for peace, and may\r\nsee disagreeably the publication of any opinion unfriendly to their wish.\r\nI will beg of you, therefore to make use of this for your own information\r\nonly, and that of the persons concerned in our commerce from your port. My\r\nduty leads me to care of them, and my desire to give no offence makes me\r\nwish to give no further alarm. I make the same communication to the ports\r\nof Nantes, L'Orient, and Havre. I am, with much esteem, Sir, your most\r\nobedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DUMAS.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, September 10, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am honored with your favor of the 5th instant, and will forward\r\nthe letter to Mr. Jay by the packet-boat which sails the 25th of this\r\nmonth. I am sorry for the situation in which Mr. Grand's refusal to make\r\nfurther advances has placed you. I know its pain, because I participate of\r\nit. The aspect of your affairs has also been discouraging. Perhaps the war\r\nkindled between Russia and Turkey may engage your friends, of necessity in\r\nmeasures they wished to avoid, and may ultimately relieve you. Our Federal\r\nConvention is likely to sit till October; there is a general disposition\r\nthrough the States to adopt what they shall propose, and we may be assured\r\ntheir propositions will be wise, as a more able assembly never sat in\r\nAmerica. Happily for us, that when we find our constitutions defective and\r\ninsufficient to secure the happiness of our people, we can assemble with\r\nall the coolness of philosophers, and set it to rights, while every other\r\nnation on earth must have recourse to arms to amend or to restore their\r\nconstitutions. The sale of our western lands begins this month. I hope\r\nfrom this measure a very speedy reduction of our national debt. It can\r\nonly be applied to pay off the principal, being irrevocably made a sinking\r\nfund for that purpose. I have the honor to be, with much esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DON FRANCISCO CHIAPPI.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, September 15, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have lately received from Mr. Jay, Secretary for foreign affairs\r\nto the United States of America, the enclosed letter from Congress to\r\nhis Majesty the Emperor (whom God preserve), and their ratification of\r\nthe treaty between his Majesty (whom God preserve) and the United States,\r\ntogether with an instruction to forward them to you, to be delivered into\r\nthe hands of his Majesty (whom God preserve). I am at the same time to\r\nask the favor of you to deliver the inclosed letter to Taher Ben Abdelkack\r\nFennish.\r\n\r\nMr. Jay also informs me that Congress had confirmed Mr. Barclay's\r\nappointment of yourself to be their agent at Morocco, of Don Joseph\r\nChiappi to be their agent at Mogador, and Don Girolamo Chiappi to be\r\ntheir agent at Tangier, with which agents it was their desire that their\r\nministers at Versailles and London should regularly correspond; that want\r\nof time prevented his having and sending to me the certified copies of\r\nthese acts by that opportunity, but that he would do it by the next. It\r\nwill be with singular pleasure that I shall be instrumental in forwarding\r\nto you these testimonies of the sense which Congress entertains of your\r\npersonal merit, and of your dispositions to be useful to the citizens of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I shall be very happy to receive from you such\r\ncommunications, from time to time, as may be interesting to either nation,\r\nand will avail myself of every occasion of making communications of the\r\nsame nature to you, and of assuring you of those sentiments of esteem and\r\nrespect with which I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. WYTHE.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, Sept. 16, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am now to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of Dec.\r\nthe 13th and 22d, 1786, and of Jan., 1787. These should not have been so\r\nlong unanswered, but that they arrived during my absence on a journey\r\nof between three and four months through the southern parts of France,\r\nand northern of Italy. In the latter country, my time allowed me to go\r\nno farther than Turin, Milan, and Genoa: consequently, I scarcely got\r\ninto classical ground. I took with me some of the writings, in which\r\nendeavors have been made to investigate the passage of Annibal over the\r\nAlps, and was just able to satisfy myself, from a view of the country,\r\nthat the descriptions given of his march are not sufficiently particular\r\nto enable us, at this day, even to guess at his track across the Alps.\r\nIn architecture, painting, sculpture, I found much amusement; but more\r\nthan all, in their agriculture, many objects of which might be adopted\r\nwith us to great advantage. I am persuaded, there are many parts of our\r\nlower country where the olive tree might be raised, which is assuredly\r\nthe richest gift of heaven. I can scarcely except bread. I see this tree\r\nsupporting thousands among the Alps, where there is not soil enough to\r\nmake bread for a single family. The caper too, might be cultivated with\r\nus. The fig we do raise. I do not speak of the vine, because it is the\r\nparent of misery. Those who cultivate it are always poor, and he who would\r\nemploy himself with us in the culture of corn, cotton, &c., can procure,\r\nin exchange for them, much more wine, and better, than he could raise by\r\nits direct culture.\r\n\r\nI sent you formerly copies of the documents on the Tagliaferro family,\r\nwhich I had received from Mr. Febroni. I now send the originals. I have\r\nprocured for you a copy of Polybius, the best edition; but the best\r\nedition of Vitruvius, which is with the commentaries of Ticinus, is not to\r\nbe got here. I have sent to Holland for it. In the meantime, the Polybius\r\ncomes in a box containing books for Peter Carr, and for some of my friends\r\nin Williamsburg and its vicinities. I have taken the liberty of addressing\r\nthe box to you. It goes to New York in the packet boat which carries this\r\nletter, and will be forwarded to you by water, by Mr. Madison. Its freight\r\nto New York is paid here. The transportation from thence to Williamsburg\r\nwill be demanded of you, and shall stand as the equivalent to the cost\r\nof Polybius and Vitruvius, if you please. The difference either way will\r\nnot be worth the trouble of raising and transmitting accounts. I send you\r\nherewith, a state of the contents of the box, and for whom each article\r\nis. Among these are some, as you will perceive, of which I ask your\r\nacceptance. It is a great comfort to me, that while here, I am able to\r\nfurnish some amusement to my friends, by sending them such productions\r\nof genius, ancient and modern, as might otherwise escape them; and I hope\r\nthey will permit me to avail myself of the occasion while it lasts.\r\n\r\nThis world is going all to war. I hope ours will remain clear of it. It\r\nis already declared between the Turks and Russians, and considering the\r\npresent situation of Holland, it cannot fail to spread itself all over\r\nEurope. Perhaps it may not be till next spring, that the other powers will\r\nbe engaged in it: nor is it as yet clear how they will arrange themselves.\r\nI think it not impossible that France and the two empires may join against\r\nall the rest. The Patriotic party in Holland will be saved by this, and\r\nthe Turks sacrificed. The only thing which can prevent the union of France\r\nand the two empires, is the difficulty of agreeing about the partition\r\nof the spoils. Constantinople is the key of Asia. Who shall have it? is\r\nthe question. I cannot help looking forward to the re-establishment of\r\nthe Greeks as a people, and the language of Homer becoming again a living\r\nlanguage, as among possible events. You have now with you Mr. Paradise,\r\nwho can tell you how easily the modern may be improved into the ancient\r\nGreek.\r\n\r\nYou ask me in your letter, what ameliorations I think necessary in our\r\nfederal constitution. It is now too late to answer the question, and it\r\nwould always have been presumption in me to have done it. Your own ideas,\r\nand those of the great characters who were to be concerned with you in\r\nthese discussions, will give the law, as they ought to do, to us all.\r\nMy own general idea was, that the States should severally preserve their\r\nsovereignty in whatever concerns themselves alone, and that whatever may\r\nconcern another State, or any foreign nation, should be made a part of\r\nthe federal sovereignty; that the exercise of the federal sovereignty\r\nshould be divided among three several bodies, legislative, executive,\r\nand judiciary, as the State sovereignities are; and that some peaceable\r\nmeans should be contrived, for the federal head to force compliance\r\non the part of the States. I have reflected on your idea of wooden, or\r\nivory diagrams, for the geometrical demonstrations. I should think wood\r\nas good as ivory; and that in this case, it might add to the improvement\r\nof the young gentlemen, that they should make the figures themselves.\r\nBeing furnished by a workman with a piece of veneer, no other tool than a\r\npenknife and a wooden rule, would be necessary. Perhaps pasteboards, or\r\ncommon cards, might be still more convenient. The difficulty is, how to\r\nreconcile figures which must have a very sensible breadth to our ideas of\r\na mathematical line, which, as it has neither breadth nor thickness, will\r\nrevolt more at these than at simple lines drawn on paper or slate. If,\r\nafter reflecting on this proposition, you would prefer having them made\r\nhere, lay your commands on me, and they shall be executed.\r\n\r\nI return you a thousand thanks for your goodness to my nephew. After\r\nmy debt to you for whatever I am myself, it is increasing it too much\r\nto interest yourself for his future fortune. But I know, that to you, a\r\nconsciousness of doing good is a luxury ineffable. You have enjoyed it\r\nalready, beyond all human measure, and that you may long live to enjoy it,\r\nand to bless your country and friends, is the sincere prayer of him who\r\nis, with every possible sentiment of esteem and respect, dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. RITTENHOUSE.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, September 18, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am now to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of April the\r\n14th, and June the 26th, as also of the second volume of the transactions\r\nyou were so kind as to send me. It would have been a grateful present\r\nindeed, could you have accompanied them with a copy of your observations\r\non our western country. Besides the interest I feel in that country in\r\ncommon with others, I have a particular one, as having ventured so many\r\ncrudities on that subject. A copy of these, with some late corrections,\r\nI have put into a box of books sent to Mr. Madison, and another for Mr.\r\nHopkinson. I hope he will forward them to you from New York. I have also\r\nput into the same box for you a dissertation, by De la Sauvagere, on the\r\nspontaneous growth of shells. When I was at Tours this summer, I inquired\r\ninto the character of De la Sauvagere, from a gentleman who had known him\r\nwell. He told me he was a person of talents, but of a heated imagination;\r\nhowever, that he might be depended on for any facts advanced on his own\r\nknowledge. This gentleman added, that he had seen such proofs of this\r\ngrowth of shells in many parts of the country round Tours, as to convince\r\nhim of the truth of the fact; and that he has never seen any person, even\r\nthe most incredulous, quit those Falunieres but under the same conviction.\r\nAfter all, I cannot say I give faith to it. It is so unlike the processes\r\nof nature, to produce the same effect in two different ways, that I can\r\nonly bring myself to agree it is not impossible. I have added for you\r\nthe Connoissance des Temps for '88 and '89, and a copy of Fourcroi's\r\nChemistry, which is the best and most complete publication in that line,\r\nwhich we have had for some time past. I shall be happy to receive an\r\naccount of your improvement in time-pieces, as well as the third volume of\r\nthe transactions, when published. There are abundance of good things in\r\nthe second volume. But I must say there are several which have not merit\r\nenough to be placed in such company. I think we should be a little rigid\r\nin our admission of papers. It is the peculiar privilege derived from\r\nour not being obliged to publish a volume in any fixed period of time. A\r\nperson here pretends to have discovered the method of rendering sea-water\r\npotable, and has some respectable certificates of its success. He has\r\ncontrived a varnish, also, for lining biscuit barrels, which preserves\r\nthe biscuit good, and keeps it free from insects. He asks money for his\r\nsecrets, so we are not to know them soon.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of Holland had got so far entangled as to leave little hope\r\nthat war could be avoided. In this situation, the Turks have declared war\r\nagainst the Russians. This, I think, renders a general war inevitable.\r\nPerhaps the European powers may take this winter to determine which side\r\neach shall take. There is a possibility that an alliance between France\r\nand the two empires may induce England and Prussia to tread back their\r\nsteps. In that case, the Patriotic party in Holland will be peaceably\r\nplaced at the head of their government. The Turks will be driven out\r\nof Europe, their continental possessions divided between Russia and the\r\nEmperor, and perhaps their islands and Egypt allotted to France. These\r\nevents seem possible at present. * * * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE THE COMMISSIONERS OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, September 18, 1787.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--Congress having thought proper, by their vote of July the\r\n18th, to entrust me to take measures for the redemption of our captives at\r\nAlgiers, and to desire you to furnish the money necessary, it is proper to\r\nstate to you some data whereby you may judge what sum is necessary. The\r\nFrench prisoners, last redeemed by the order of Mathurins, cost somewhat\r\nless than four hundred dollars: but the General of the order told me,\r\nthat they had always been made to pay more for foreign prisoners than\r\ntheir own. The smallest sum then, at which we can expect ours, including\r\nredemption, clothing, feeding, and transportation, will be five hundred\r\ndollars each. There are twenty of them. Of course, ten thousand dollars\r\nis the smallest sum which can be requisite. I think a larger sum should\r\nbe set apart, as so much of it as shall not be wanting for the prisoners,\r\nwill remain for other uses. As soon as you shall have notified me that\r\nthe money is ready, I will proceed to execute the order of Congress.\r\nI must add the injunctions of the General of the Mathurins, that it be\r\nnot made known that the public interest themselves in the redemption of\r\nthese prisoners, as that would induce the Algerians to demand the most\r\nextravagant price. I have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most\r\nprofound respect, Gentlemen, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, September 19, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--My last letters to you were of the 6th and 15th of August; since\r\nwhich, I have been honored with yours of July the 24th, acknowledging\r\nthe receipt of mine of the 14th and 23d of February. I am anxious to\r\nhear you have received that also of May the 4th, written from Marseilles.\r\nAccording to the desires of Congress, expressed in their vote confirming\r\nthe appointments of Francisco, Giuseppa and Girolamo Chiappi, their\r\nagents in Morocco, I have written letters to these gentlemen, to begin a\r\ncorrespondence with them. To the first, I have inclosed the ratification\r\nof the treaty with the Emperor of Morocco, and shall send it either by\r\nour agent at Marseilles, who is now here, or by the Count Daranda, who\r\nsets out for Madrid in a few days, having relinquished his embassy here.\r\nI shall proceed on the redemption of our captives at Algiers, as soon as\r\nthe commissioners of the treasury shall enable me, by placing the money\r\nnecessary, under my orders. The prisoners redeemed by the religious order\r\nof Mathurins, cost about four hundred dollars each, and the General of\r\nthe order told me, that they had never been able to redeem foreigners on\r\nso good terms as their own countrymen. Supposing that their redemption,\r\nclothing, feeding and transportation, should amount to five hundred\r\ndollars each, there must be, at least, a sum of ten thousand dollars set\r\napart for this purpose. Till this is done, I shall take no other step than\r\nthe preparatory one, of destroying at Algiers all idea of our intending\r\nto redeem the prisoners. This, the General of the Mathurins told me, was\r\nindispensably necessary, and that it must not, on any account, transpire,\r\nthat the public would interest themselves for their redemption. This was\r\nrendered the more necessary, by the declaration of the Dey to the Spanish\r\nconsul, that he should hold him responsible, at the Spanish price, for our\r\nprisoners, even for such as should die. Three of them have died of the\r\nplague. By authorizing me to redeem at the prices _usually_ paid by the\r\nEuropean nations, Congress, I suppose, could not mean the Spanish price,\r\nwhich is not only unusual, but unprecedented, and would make our vessels\r\nthe first object with those pirates. I shall pay no attention, therefore,\r\nto the Spanish price, unless further instructed. Hard as it may seem, I\r\nshould think it necessary not to let it be known even to the relations of\r\nthe captives, that we mean to redeem them.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to enclose you a paper from the admiralty of Guadaloupe,\r\nsent to me as a matter of form, and to be lodged, I suppose, with our\r\nmarine records. I enclose, also, a copy of a letter from the Count de\r\nFlorida Blanca to Mr. Carmichael, by which you will perceive, they have\r\nreferred the settlement of the claim of South Carolina for the use of\r\ntheir frigate, to Mr. Gardoqui, and to the Delegates of South Carolina in\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nI had the honor to inform you, in my last letter, of the parliament's\r\nbeing transferred to Troyes. To put an end to the tumults in Paris,\r\nsome regiments were brought nearer, the patroles were strengthened and\r\nmultiplied, some mutineers punished by imprisonment: it produced the\r\ndesired effect. It is confidently believed, however, that the parliament\r\nwill be immediately recalled, the stamp tax and land tax repealed, and\r\nother means devised of accommodating their receipts and expenditures.\r\nThose supposed to be in contemplation, are a rigorous levy of the old\r\ntax of the _deux vingtièmes_, on the rich, who had, in a great measure,\r\nwithdrawn their property from it, as well as on the poor, on whom it had\r\nprincipally fallen. This will greatly increase the receipts; while they\r\nare proceeding on the other hand, to reform their expenses far beyond what\r\nthey had promised. It is said these reformations will amount to eighty\r\nmillions. Circumstances render these measures more and more pressing.\r\nI mentioned to you in my last letter, that the officer charged by the\r\nministry to watch the motion of the British squadron, had returned with\r\ninformation that it had sailed westwardly. The fact was not true. He had\r\nformed his conclusion too hastily, and thus led the ministry into error.\r\nThe King of Prussia, urged on by England, has pressed more and more the\r\naffairs of Holland, and lately has given to the States General of Holland,\r\nfour days only to comply with his demand. This measure would, of itself,\r\nhave rendered it impossible for France to proceed longer in the line of\r\naccommodation with Prussia. In the same moment, an event takes place,\r\nwhich seems to render all attempt at accommodation idle. The Turks have\r\ndeclared war against the Russians, and that under circumstances which\r\nexclude all prospect of preventing its taking place. The King of Prussia\r\nhaving deserted his ancient friends, there remains only France and Turkey,\r\nperhaps Spain also, to oppose the two empires, Russia and England. By such\r\na piece of Quixotism, France might plunge herself into ruin with the Turks\r\nand Dutch, but would save neither. But there is certainly a confederacy\r\nsecretly in contemplation, of which the public have not yet the smallest\r\nsuspicion; that is, between France and the two empires. I think it sure\r\nthat Russia has desired this, and that the Emperor, after some hesitation,\r\nhas acceded. It rests on this country to close. Her indignation against\r\nthe King of Prussia will be some spur. She will thereby save her party in\r\nHolland, and only abandon the Turks to that fate she cannot ward off, and\r\nwhich their precipitation has brought on themselves, by the instigations\r\nof the English ambassador at the Porte, and against the remonstrances of\r\nthe French ambassador. Perhaps this formidable combination, should it take\r\nplace, may prevent the war of the western powers, as it would seem that\r\nneither England nor Prussia would carry their false calculations so far,\r\nas, with the aid of the Turks only, to oppose themselves to such a force.\r\nIn that case, the Patriots of Holland would be peaceably established in\r\nthe powers of their government, and the war go on against the Turks only,\r\nwho would probably be driven from Europe. This new arrangement would be a\r\ntotal change of the European system, and a favorable one for our friends.\r\nThe probability of a general war, in which this country will be engaged\r\non one side, and England on the other, has appeared to me sufficient to\r\njustify my writing to our agents in the different ports of France, to put\r\nour merchants on their guard, against risking their property in French\r\nor English bottoms. The Emperor, instead of tracing back his steps in\r\nBrabant, as was expected, has pursued the less honorable plan of decoying\r\nhis subjects thence by false pretences, to let themselves be invested by\r\nhis troops, and this done, he dictates to them his own terms. Yet it is\r\nnot certain the matter will end with that.\r\n\r\nThe Count de Moustier is nominated Minister Plenipotentiary to America;\r\nand a frigate is ordered to Cherbourg, to carry him over. He will endeavor\r\nto sail by the middle of the next month, but if any delay should make him\r\npass over the whole of October, he will defer his voyage to the spring,\r\nbeing unwilling to take a winter passage. Monsieur de St. Priest is\r\nsent ambassador to Holland, in the room of Monsieur de Verac, appointed\r\nto Switzerland. The Chevalier de Luzerne might, I believe, have gone\r\nto Holland, but he preferred a general promise of promotion, and the\r\npossibility that it might be to the court of London. His prospects are\r\nvery fair. His brother, the Count de la Luzerne, (now Governor in the West\r\nIndies,) is appointed minister of the marine, in the place of Monsieur\r\nde Castries, who has resigned. The Archbishop of Thoulouse is appointed\r\n_ministre principale_, and his brother, Monsieur de Brienne, minister of\r\nwar, in the place of Monsieur de Segur. The department of the Comptroller\r\nhas had a very rapid succession of tenants. From Monsieur de Calonnes it\r\npassed to Monsieur de Forqueux, from him to Villedeuil, and from him to\r\nLambert, who holds it at present, but divided with a Monsieur Cabarrus,\r\n(whom I believe you knew in Spain,) who is named _Directeur du tresor\r\nroyal_, the office into which M. Neckar came at first. I had the honor\r\nto inform you, that before the departure of the Count de Luzerne to his\r\ngovernment in the West Indies, I had pressed on him the patronage of\r\nour trade with the French islands; that he appeared well disposed, and\r\nassured me he would favor us as much as his instructions, and the laws\r\nof the colonies, would permit. I am in hopes these dispositions will be\r\nstrengthened by his residence in the islands, and that his acquaintance\r\namong the people there, will be an additional motive to favor them.\r\nProbably they will take advantage of his appointment, to press indulgences\r\nin commerce with us. The ministry is of a liberal complexion, and well\r\ndisposed to us. The war may add to the motives for opening their islands\r\nto other resources for their subsistence, and for doing what may be\r\nagreeable to us. It seems to me, at present, then, that the moment of\r\nthe arrival of the Count de La Luzerne, will be the moment for trying to\r\nobtain a freer access to their islands. It would be very material to do\r\nthis, if possible, in a permanent way, that is to say, by treaty. But\r\nI know of nothing we have to offer in equivalent. Perhaps the payment\r\nof our debt to them might be made use of as some inducement, while they\r\nare so distressed for money. Yet the borrowing the money in Holland will\r\nbe rendered more difficult by the same event, in proportion as it will\r\nincrease the demand for money by other powers.\r\n\r\nThe gazettes of Leyden and France to this date are enclosed, together with\r\nsome pamphlets on the internal affairs of this country.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES THOMPSON.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, Sept. 20, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of April the 28th did not come to my hands till the\r\nfirst instant. Unfortunately, the box of plants, which were a day too late\r\nto come by the April packet, missed the packet of June the 10th also, and\r\nonly came by that of July the 25th. They are not yet arrived at Paris,\r\nbut I expect them daily. I am sensible of your kind attention to them,\r\nand that as you were leaving New York, you took the course which bade\r\nfair to be the best. That they were forgotten in the hands in which you\r\nplaced them, was probably owing to too much business, and more important.\r\nI have desired Mr. Madison to refund to you the money you were so kind as\r\nto advance for me. The delay of your letter will apologize for this delay\r\nof the repayment. I thank you also for the extract of the letter you were\r\nso kind as to communicate to me, on the antiquities found in the western\r\ncountry. I wish that the persons who go thither would make very exact\r\ndescriptions of what they see of that kind, without forming any theories.\r\nThe moment a person forms a theory, his imagination sees, in every object,\r\nonly the traits which favor that theory. But it is too early to form\r\ntheories on those antiquities. We must wait with patience till more facts\r\nare collected. I wish your Philosophical Society would collect exact\r\ndescriptions of the several monuments as yet known, and insert them naked\r\nin their Transactions, and continue their attention to those hereafter to\r\nbe discovered. Patience and observation may enable us in time, to solve\r\nthe problem, whether those who formed the scattering monuments in our\r\nwestern country, were colonies sent off from Mexico, or the founders of\r\nMexico itself? Whether both were the descendants or the progenitors of\r\nthe Asiatic red men? The Mexican tradition, mentioned by Dr. Robertson,\r\nis an evidence, but a feeble one, in favor of the one opinion. The number\r\nof languages radically different, is a strong evidence in favor of the\r\ncontrary one. There is an American by the name of Ledyard, he who was with\r\nCaptain Cook on his last voyage, and wrote an account of that voyage,\r\nwho has gone to St. Petersburg; from thence he was to go to Kamschatka;\r\nto cross over thence to the northwest coast of America, and to penetrate\r\nthrough the main continent, to our side of it. He is a person of ingenuity\r\nand information. Unfortunately, he has too much imagination. However, if\r\nhe escapes safely, he will give us new, curious and useful information.\r\nI had a letter from him, dated last March, when he was about to leave St.\r\nPetersburg on his way to Kamschatka.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the inclination of the strata of rocks, I had observed\r\nthem between the Blue Ridge and North Mountains in Virginia, to be\r\nparallel with the pole of the earth. I observed the same thing in most\r\ninstances in the Alps, between Cette and Turin; but in returning along\r\nthe precipices of the Apennines, where they hang over the Mediterranean,\r\ntheir direction was totally different and various; and you mention that\r\nin our western country they are horizontal. This variety proves they have\r\nnot been formed by subsidence, as some writers of theories of the earth\r\nhave pretended; for then they should always have been in circular strata,\r\nand concentric. It proves, too, that they have not been formed by the\r\nrotation of the earth on its axis, as might have been suspected, had all\r\nthese strata been parallel with that axis. They may, indeed, have been\r\nthrown up by explosions, as Whitehurst supposes, or have been the effect\r\nof convulsions. But there can be no proof of the explosion, nor is it\r\nprobable that convulsions have deformed every spot of the earth. It is now\r\ngenerally agreed that rock grows, and it seems that it grows in layers in\r\nevery direction, as the branches of trees grow in all directions. Why seek\r\nfarther the solution of this phenomenon? Everything in nature decays. If\r\nit were not reproduced then by growth, there would be a chasm.\r\n\r\nI remember you asked me, in a former letter, whether the steam mill in\r\nLondon was turned by the steam immediately, or by the intermediate agency\r\nof water raised by the steam. When I was in London, Boulton made a secret\r\nof his mill. Therefore, I was permitted to see it only superficially.\r\nI saw no water wheels, and therefore supposed none. I answered you,\r\naccordingly, that there were none. But when I was at Nismes, I went to\r\nsee the steam mill there, and they showed it to me in all the parts. I\r\nsaw that their steam raised water, and that this water turned a wheel.\r\nI expressed my doubts of the necessity of the inter-agency of water,\r\nand that the London mill was without it. But they supposed me mistaken;\r\nperhaps I was so; I have had no opportunity since of clearing up the\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI had a letter from Mr. Churchman, but not developing his plan of knowing\r\nthe longitude, fully. I wrote him what was doubted about it, so far as we\r\ncould conjecture what it was.\r\n\r\nI am, with very great and sincere esteem, dear Sir, your friend and\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, Sept. 22, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The letters of which the enclosed are copies, are this moment\r\nreceived, and as there is a possibility that they may reach Havre before\r\nthe packet sails, I have the honor of enclosing them to you. They contain\r\na promise of reducing the duties on tar, pitch and turpentine, and that\r\nthe government will interest itself with the city of Rouen, to reduce the\r\nlocal duty on potash. By this you will perceive that we are getting on a\r\nlittle in this business, though under their present embarrassments, it is\r\ndifficult to procure the attention of the ministers to it. The parliament\r\nhas enregistered the edict of a rigorous levy of the _deux vingtiemes_.\r\nAs this was proposed by the King in lieu of the impost territorial, there\r\nis no doubt now that the latter, with the stamp tax, will be immediately\r\nrepealed. There can be no better proof of the revolution in the public\r\nopinion, as to the powers of the monarch, and of the force, too, of that\r\nopinion. Six weeks ago, we saw the King displaying the plentitude of his\r\nomnipotence, as hitherto conceived, to enforce these two acts. At this\r\nday, he is forced to retract them by the public voice; for as to the\r\nopposition of the parliament, that body is too little esteemed to produce\r\nthis effect in any case where the public do not throw themselves into the\r\nsame scale.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, Sept. 22, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--When I had the honor of addressing you this morning, intelligence\r\nwas handing about, which I did not think well enough authenticated to\r\ncommunicate to you. As it is now ascertained, I avail myself of the chance\r\nthat another post may yet reach Havre before the departure of the packet.\r\nThis will depend on the wind, which has for some days been unfavorable.\r\nI must premise, that this court, about ten days ago, declared, by their\r\nchargé des affaires in Holland, that if the Prussian troops continued to\r\nmenace Holland with an invasion, his Majesty was determined, in quality\r\nof ally, to succor that province. An _official_ letter from the Hague, of\r\nthe 18th instant, assures that the Prussian army entered the territory of\r\nHolland on the 15th, that most of the principal towns had submitted, some\r\nafter firing a gun or two, others without resistance; that the Rhingrave\r\nde Salm had evacuated Utretcht, with part of the troops under his command,\r\nleaving behind him one hundred and forty-four pieces of cannon, with great\r\nwarlike stores; that the standard of Orange was hoisted everywhere; that\r\nno other cockade could be worn at the Hague; that the States General were\r\nto assemble that night for reinstating the Stadtholder in all his rights.\r\nThe letter concludes, \"we have this moment intelligence that Woerden\r\nhas capitulated; so that Amsterdam remains without defence.\" So far the\r\nletter. We know, otherwise, that Monsieur de St. Priest, who had set\r\nout on his embassy to the Hague, has stopped at Antwerp, not choosing to\r\nproceed further till new orders. This court has been completely deceived,\r\nfirst by its own great desire to avoid a war, and secondly by calculating\r\nthat the King of Prussia would have acted on principles of common sense,\r\nwhich would surely have dictated, that a power, lying between the jaws\r\nof Russia and Austria, should not separate itself from France, unless,\r\nindeed, he had assurances of dispositions in those two powers, which\r\nare not supposed to exist. On the contrary, I am persuaded that they ask\r\nthe alliance of France, whom we suppose to be under hesitations between\r\nher reluctance to abandon the Turks, her jealousy of increasing by their\r\nspoils, the power of the two empires, and the inability to oppose them.\r\nIf they cannot obtain her alliance, they will surely join themselves to\r\nEngland and Prussia.\r\n\r\nOfficial advices are received, that the first division of the Russian\r\narmy has passed the Borysthenes into the Polish Ukraine, and is marching\r\ntowards the frontiers of Turkey. Thus, we may consider the flames of war\r\nas completely kindled in two distinct parts of this quarter of the globe,\r\nand that though France and England have not yet engaged themselves in it,\r\nthe probabilities are, that they will do it.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CARNES.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, September 22, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am honored by your favor of the 17th instant. A war between France\r\nand England does not necessarily engage America in it; and I think she\r\nwill be disposed rather to avail herself of the advantages of a neutral\r\npower. By the former usage of nations, the goods of a friend were safe,\r\nthough taken in an enemy bottom, and those of an enemy were lawful prize,\r\nthough found in a free bottom. But in our treaties with France, &c., we\r\nhave established the simpler rule, that a free bottom makes free goods,\r\nand an enemy bottom, enemy goods. The same rule has been adopted by the\r\ntreaty of armed neutrality between Russia, Sweden, Denmark, Holland and\r\nPortugal, and assented to by France and Spain. Contraband goods, however,\r\nare always excepted, so that they may still be seized; but the same powers\r\nhave established that naval stores are not contraband; and this may be\r\nconsidered now as the law of nations. Though England acquiesced under this\r\nduring the late war, rather than draw on herself the neutral powers, yet\r\nshe never acceded to the new principle, and her obstinacy on this point,\r\nis what has prevented the late renewal of her treaty with Russia. On the\r\ncommencement of a new war, this principle will probably be insisted on by\r\nthe neutral powers, whom we may suppose to be Sweden, Denmark, Portugal,\r\nAmerica, and perhaps Spain. Quere; if England will again acquiesce.\r\nSupposing these details might be useful to you, I have taken the liberty\r\nof giving them, and of assuring you of the esteem with which I am, Sir,\r\nyour very humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. LIMOZIN.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, September 22, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I must trouble you with another letter to Mr. Jay, to be delivered\r\nto Monsieur Bourgoin on board the packet, which I hope will not be sailed\r\nbefore it gets to your hands, as the letter is of extreme importance. It\r\nis to inform Congress that official advice is just received here that the\r\nPrussian troops entered the territory of Holland on the 15th instant; that\r\nmost of the principal towns had submitted, that Utrecht was evacuated by\r\nthe Rhingrave de Salm, and Woerden capitulated, so that Amsterdam remained\r\nwithout defence. M. de St. Priest had stopped at Antwerp and waited\r\nfurther orders. We know also, that the first division of the Russian\r\narmy has passed the Borysthenes into the Polish Ukraine, and is marching\r\ntowards the frontiers of Turkey. War then is well kindled in those two\r\nquarters. Monsieur Cabarus is arrived at Paris, but will not accept the\r\nappointment offered him unless they will adopt his plans. On this there is\r\nhesitation; so that it is not certain he will come in.\r\n\r\nI have received your favor of the 20th, and shall make proper use of its\r\ncontents. Should the packet be sailed, I will pray you to send my letter\r\nby the first of the vessels which you mention bound for Philadelphia. I\r\nam, with great esteem, Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, September 24, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The times are now so critical, that every day brings something\r\nnew and important, not known the day before. Observing the wind still\r\nunfavorable, I am in hopes the packet may not sail to-morrow, and that\r\nthis letter may be at Havre in time for that conveyance. Mr. Eden has\r\nwaited on Count Montmorin to inform him, officially, that England must\r\nconsider its convention with France, relative to the giving notice of its\r\nnaval armament, as at an end, and that they are arming generally. This\r\nis considered here as a declaration of war. The Dutch ambassador told me\r\nyesterday, that he supposed the Prussian troops probably in possession\r\nof the Hague. I asked him if it would interrupt the course of business,\r\ncommercial or banking, in Amsterdam; and particularly, whether our depot\r\nof money there was safe. He said, the people of Amsterdam would be surely\r\nso wise as to submit, when they should see that they could not oppose the\r\nStadtholder; therefore he supposed our depot safe, and that there would be\r\nno interruption of business. It is the hour of the departure of the post;\r\nso I have only time to add assurances of the respect and esteem with which\r\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, September 28, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received your favor by Mr. Cutting, and thank you sincerely\r\nfor the copy of your book. The departure of a packet boat, which always\r\ngives me full employment for sometime before, has only permitted me\r\nto look into it a little. I judge of it from the first volume, which I\r\nthought formed to do a great deal of good. The first principle of a good\r\ngovernment, is certainly, a distribution of its powers into executive,\r\njudiciary and legislative, and a subdivision of the latter into two or\r\nthree branches. It is a good step gained, when it is proved that the\r\nEnglish constitution, acknowledged to be better than all which have\r\npreceded it, is only better in proportion as it has approached nearer to\r\nthis distribution of powers. From this, the last step is easy, to show\r\nby a comparison of our constitutions with that of England, how much more\r\nperfect they are. The article of Confederations is certainly worthy of\r\nyour pen. It would form a most interesting addition, to show, what have\r\nbeen the nature of the Confederations which have existed hitherto, what\r\nwere their excellences, and what their defects. A comparison of ours with\r\nthem would be to the advantage of ours, and would increase the veneration\r\nof our countrymen for it. It is a misfortune that they do not sufficiently\r\nknow the value of their constitutions, and how much happier they are\r\nrendered by them, than any other people on earth, by the governments under\r\nwhich they live.\r\n\r\nYou know all that has happened in the United Netherlands. You know\r\nalso that our friends, Van Staphorsts, will be among the most likely to\r\nbecome objects of severity, if any severities should be exercised. Is\r\nthe money in their hands entirely safe? If it is not, I am sure you have\r\nalready thought of it. Are we to suppose the game already up, and that\r\nthe Stadtholder is to be re-established, perhaps erected into a monarch,\r\nwithout the country lifting a finger in opposition to it. If so, it is a\r\nlesson the more for us. In fact, what a crowd of lessons do the present\r\nmiseries of Holland teach us? Never to have an hereditary officer of any\r\nsort: never to let a citizen ally himself with kings: never to call in\r\nforeign nations to settle domestic differences: never to suppose that\r\nany nation will expose itself to war for us, &c. Still I am not without\r\nhopes that a good rod is in soak for Prussia, and that England will feel\r\nthe end of it. It is known to some, that Russia made propositions to the\r\nEmperor and France, for acting in concert; that the Emperor consents,\r\nand has disposed four camps of one hundred and eighty thousand men, from\r\nthe limits of Turkey to those of Prussia. This court hesitates, or rather\r\nits Premier hesitates; for the Queen, Montmorin and Breteuil, are for the\r\nmeasure. Should it take place, all may yet come to rights, except for the\r\nTurks, who must retire from Europe, and this they must do, were France\r\nQuixotic enough to undertake to support them. We, I hope, shall be left\r\nfree to avail ourselves of the advantages of neutrality; and yet, much\r\nI fear, the English, or rather their stupid King, will force us out of\r\nit. For thus I reason. By forcing us into the war against them, they will\r\nbe engaged in an expensive land war, as well as a sea war. Common sense\r\ndictates, therefore, that they should let us remain neuter: _ergo_ they\r\nwill not let us remain neuter. I never yet found any other general rule\r\nfor foretelling what they will do, but that of examining what they ought\r\nnot to do.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with my best respects to Mrs. Adams, and\r\nsentiments of perfect esteem and regard to yourself, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL SMITH.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, September 28, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have duly received your favor by Mr. Cutting. I had before\r\nhad a transient acquaintance with him, and knew him to be sensible. Your\r\nrecommendation is always a new merit. I really think, and had taken the\r\nliberty some time ago of hinting to Congress, that they would do well\r\nto have a diplomatic character at Lisbon. There is no country whose\r\ncommerce is more interesting to us. I wish Congress would correspond\r\nto the wishes of that court, in sending a person there, and to mine,\r\nin sending yourself. For I confess, I had rather see you there than at\r\nLondon, because I doubt whether it be honorable for us to keep anybody\r\nat London, unless they keep some person at New York. Of all nations on\r\nearth, they require to be treated with the most hauteur. They require to\r\nbe kicked into common good manners. You ask, if you shall say anything\r\nto Sullivan about the bill. No. Only that it is paid. I have within these\r\ntwo or three days, received letters from him explaining the matter. It was\r\nreally for the skin and bones of the moose, as I had conjectured. It was\r\nmy fault, that I had not given him a rough idea of the expense I would\r\nbe willing to incur for them. He had made the acquisition an object of\r\na regular campaign, and that too of a winter one. The troops he employed\r\nsallied forth, as he writes me, in the month of March--much snow--a herd\r\nattacked--one killed--in the wilderness--a road to cut twenty miles--to be\r\ndrawn by hand from the frontiers to his house--bones to be cleaned, &c.,\r\n&c., &c. In fine, he puts himself to an infinitude of trouble, more than\r\nI meant: he did it cheerfully, and I feel myself really under obligations\r\nto him. That the tragedy might not want a proper catastrophe, the box,\r\nbones, and all, are lost, so that this chapter of Natural History will\r\nstill remain a blank. But I have written to him not to send me another.\r\nI will leave it for my successor to fill up, whenever I shall make my bow\r\nhere. The purchase for Mrs. Adams shall be made, and sent by Mr. Cutting.\r\nI shall always be happy to receive her commands. Petit shall be made\r\nhappy by her praises of his last purchase for her. I must refer you to Mr.\r\nAdams for the news. Those respecting the Dutch you know as well as I. Nor\r\nshould they be written but with the pen of Jeremiah. Adieu mon ami! Yours\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR LE COMTE DE BUFFON.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, October 3, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I had the honor of informing you, some time ago, that I had written\r\nto some of my friends in America, desiring they would send me such of the\r\nspoils of the moose, caribou, elk and deer, as might throw light on that\r\nclass of animals; but more particularly, to send me the complete skeleton,\r\nskin and horns of the moose, in such condition as that the skin might\r\nbe sewed up and stuffed, on its arrival here. I am happy to be able to\r\npresent to you at this moment, the bones and skin of a moose, the horns\r\nof another individual of the same species, the horns of the caribou, the\r\nelk, the deer, the spiked horned buck, and the roebuck of America. They\r\nall come from New Hampshire and Massachusetts, and were received by me\r\nyesterday. I give you their popular names, as it rests with yourself to\r\ndecide their real names. The skin of the moose was dressed with the hair\r\non, but a great deal of it has come off, and the rest is ready to drop\r\noff. The horns of the elk are remarkably small. I have certainly seen some\r\nof them which would have weighed five or six times as much. This is the\r\nanimal which we call elk in the southern parts of America, and of which I\r\nhave given some description in the Notes on Virginia, of which I had the\r\nhonor of presenting you a copy. I really doubt whether the flat-horned\r\nelk exists in America; and I think this may be properly classed with\r\nthe elk, the principal difference being in the horns. I have seen the\r\ndaim, the cerf, the chevreuil of Europe. But the animal we call elk, and\r\nwhich may be distinguished as the round-horned elk, is very different\r\nfrom them. I have never seen the brand-hirtz or cerf d'Ardennes, nor the\r\nEuropean elk. Could I get a sight of them, I think I should be able to\r\nsay which of them the American elk resembles most, as I am tolerably well\r\nacquainted with that animal. I must observe also, that the horns of the\r\ndeer, which accompany these spoils, are not of the fifth or sixth part\r\nof the weight of some that I have seen. This individual has been of three\r\nyears of age, according to our method of judging. I have taken measures,\r\nparticularly, to be furnished with large horns of our elk and our deer,\r\nand therefore beg of you not to consider those now sent, as furnishing\r\na specimen of their ordinary size. I really suspect you will find that\r\nthe moose, the round-horned elk, and the American deer, are species not\r\nexisting in Europe. The moose is, perhaps, of a new class. I wish these\r\nspoils, Sir, may have the merit of adding anything new to the treasures\r\nof nature, which have so fortunately come under your observation, and\r\nof which she seems to have given you the key: they will in that case be\r\nsome gratification to you, which it will always be pleasing to me to have\r\nprocured; having the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect\r\nesteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DUMAS.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, October 4, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I received your favor of the 23d of September, two days ago. That of\r\nthe 28th and 29th, was put in my hands this morning. I immediately waited\r\non the ambassadors, ordinary and extraordinary, of the United Netherlands,\r\nand also on the envoy of Prussia, and asked their good offices to have\r\nan efficacious protection extended to your person, your family, and your\r\neffects, observing that the United States know no party, but are the\r\nfriends and allies of the United Netherlands as a nation, and would expect\r\nfrom their friendship, that the person who is charged with their affairs\r\nuntil the arrival of a minister, should be covered from all insult and\r\ninjury which might be offered him by a lawless mob; well assured that\r\ntheir minister residing with Congress, would, on all occasions, receive\r\nthe same. They have been so good as to promise me, each, that he will\r\nin his first despatches press this matter on the proper power, and give\r\nme reason to hope that it will be efficacious for your safety. I will\r\ntransmit your letter to Mr. Jay by the Count de Moustier, who sets out\r\nwithin a week for New York, as Minister Plenipotentiary for France, in\r\nthat country. I sincerely sympathize in your sufferings, and wish that\r\nwhat I have done may effect an end to them, being with much respect and\r\nesteem, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY PRESIDENT SULLIVAN.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, October 5, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have now before me your several favors of April the 16th, 26th,\r\nand 30th, and of May the 9th and 29th, and received also a few days ago\r\nthe box containing the skin, bones, and horns of the moose, and other\r\nanimals, which your Excellency has been so kind as to take so much trouble\r\nto obtain and forward. They were all in good enough condition, except\r\nthat a good deal of the hair of the moose had fallen off. However, there\r\nremained still enough to give a good idea of the animal, and I am in hopes\r\nMonsieur de Buffon will be able to have him stuffed, and placed on his\r\nlegs in the King's Cabinet. He was in the country when I sent the box to\r\nthe Cabinet, so that I have as yet no answer from him. I am persuaded he\r\nwill find the moose to be a different animal from any he had described\r\nin his work. I am equally persuaded that our elk and deer are animals of\r\na different species from any existing in Europe. Unluckily, the horns of\r\nthem now received are remarkably small. However, I have taken measures to\r\nprocure some from Virginia. The moose is really a valuable acquisition;\r\nbut the skeletons of the other animals would not be worth the expense\r\nthey would occasion to me, and still less the trouble to you. Of this, you\r\nhave been already so kind as to take a great deal more than I intended to\r\nhave given you, and I beg you to accept my sincere thanks. Should a pair\r\nof large horns of the elk or deer fall into your way by accident, I would\r\nthank you to keep them till some vessel should be coming directly from\r\nyour nearest port to Havre. So also of very large horns of the moose, for\r\nI understand they are sometimes enormously large indeed. But I would ask\r\nthese things only on condition they should occasion you no trouble, and me\r\nlittle expense.\r\n\r\nYou will have known that war is commenced between the Turks and Russians,\r\nand that the Prussian troops have entered Holland, and reinstated the\r\nStadtholder. It is said that even Amsterdam has capitulated. Yet it\r\nis possible, and rather probable, this country will engage in a war to\r\nrestore the Patriots. If they do, it will be the most general one long\r\nknown in Europe. We, I hope, shall enjoy the blessings of a neutrality,\r\nand probably see England once more humbled. I am, with great esteem and\r\nrespect, your Excellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, October 8, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I had the honor of writing you on the 19th of September, twice on\r\nthe 22d, and again on the 24th. The two first went by the packet, the\r\nthird by a vessel bound to Philadelphia. I have not yet learned by what\r\noccasion the last went. In these several letters, I communicated to you\r\nthe occurrences of Europe, as far as they were then known. Notwithstanding\r\nthe advantage which the Emperor seemed to have gained over his subjects\r\nof Brabant, by the military arrangements he had been permitted to make\r\nunder false pretexts, he has not obtained his ends. He certainly wished\r\nto enforce his new regulations; but he wished more to be cleared of all\r\ndomestic difficulties, that he might be free to act in the great scenes\r\nwhich are preparing for the theatre of Europe. He seems, therefore to\r\nhave instructed his Governor General of the Netherlands to insist on\r\ncompliance as far as could be insisted, without producing resistance by\r\narms; but, at the same time, to have furnished him with a sufficiently\r\ncomplete recantation, to prevent the effects of insurrection. The Governor\r\npressed; the people were firm; a small act of force was then attempted,\r\nwhich produced a decided resistance, in which the people killed several\r\nof the military: the last resource was then used, which was the act of\r\nrecantation; this produced immediate tranquillity, and everything there is\r\nnow finally settled, by the Emperor's relinquishment of his plans.\r\n\r\nMy letter of the evening of September the 22d, informed you that the\r\nPrussian troops had entered Holland, and that of the 24th that England had\r\nannounced to this court that she was arming generally. These two events\r\nbeing simultaneous, proved that the two sovereigns acted in concert.\r\nImmediately after, the court of London announced to the other courts\r\nof Europe, that if France entered Holland with armed force, she would\r\nconsider it as an act of hostility, and declare war against her; sending\r\nMr. Granville here at the same, to make what she called a conciliatory\r\nproposition. This proposition was received as a new insult, Mr. Granville\r\nvery coolly treated, and he has now gone back. It is said, he has carried\r\nthe ultimatum of France. What it is, particularly, has not transpired; it\r\nis only supposed, in general, to be very firm. You will see, in one of the\r\nLeyden gazettes, one of the letters written by the ministers of England\r\nto the courts of their respective residence, communicating the declaration\r\nbefore mentioned. In the meantime, Holland has been sooner reduced by the\r\nPrussian troops than could have been expected. The abandonment of Utrecht\r\nby the Rhingrave of Salm, seems to have thrown the people under a general\r\npanic, during which every place submitted, except Amsterdam. That had\r\nopened conferences with the Duke of Brunswick; but as late as the second\r\ninstant, no capitulation was yet concluded. The King of Prussia, on his\r\nfirst move, demanded categorically of the King of Poland, what part he\r\nintended to act in the event of war. The latter answered, he should act as\r\nevents should dictate; and is, in consequence of this species of menace\r\nfrom Prussia, arming himself. He can bring into the field almost seventy\r\nthousand good cavalry. In the meantime, though nothing transpires publicly\r\nof the confederation between France and the two empires, mentioned in my\r\nletter of September the 19th, it is not the less sure that it is on the\r\ncarpet, and will take place. To the circumstances before mentioned may\r\nbe added, as further indications of war, the naming as Generalissimo of\r\ntheir marine on the Atlantic, Monsieur de Suffrein, on the Mediterranean,\r\nMonsieur Albert de Rioms, the recalling Monsieur de St. Priest, their\r\nambassador, from Antwerp, before he had reached the Hague, and the\r\nactivity of their armies by sea. On the other hand, the little movement by\r\nland would make one suppose they expected to put the King of Prussia into\r\nother hands. They, too, like the Emperor, are arranging matters at home.\r\nThe rigorous levy of the _deux vingtiemes_ is enregistered, the stamp act\r\nand impost territorial are revoked, the parliament recalled, the nation\r\nsoothed by these acts, and inspired by the insults of the British court.\r\nThe part of the Council still leaning towards peace, are become unpopular,\r\nand perhaps may feel the effects of it. No change in the administration\r\nhas taken place since my last, unless we may consider as such, Monsieur\r\nCabarrus's refusal to stand in the lines. Thinking he should be forced to\r\nfollow, too seriously, plans formed by others, he has declined serving.\r\n\r\nShould this war take place, as is quite probable, and should it be as\r\ngeneral as it threatens to be, our neutrality must be attended with great\r\nadvantages. Whether of a nature to improve our morals or our happiness,\r\nis another question. But is it sure, that Great Britain, by her searches,\r\nher seizures, and other measures for harassing us, will permit us to\r\npreserve our neutrality? I know it may be argued, that the land war which\r\nshe would superadd to her sea war, by provoking us to join her enemies,\r\nshould rationally hold her to her good behavior with us. But since the\r\naccession of the present monarch, has it not been passion, and not reason\r\nwhich, nine times out of ten, has dictated her measures? Has there been a\r\nbetter rule of prognosticating what he would do, than to examine what he\r\nought not to do? When I review his dispositions, and review his conduct, I\r\nhave little hope of his permitting our neutrality. He will find subjects\r\nof provocation in various articles of our treaty with France, which will\r\nnow come into view, in all their consequences, and in consequences very\r\nadvantageous to the one, and injurious to the other country. I suggest\r\nthese doubts, on a supposition that our magazines are not prepared for\r\nwar, and in the opinion that provisions for that event should be thought\r\nof.\r\n\r\nThe enclosed letter from Mr. Dumas came to me open, though directed to\r\nyou. I immediately waited on the ambassadors, ordinary and extraordinary,\r\nof Holland, and the envoy of Prussia, and prayed them to interest\r\nthemselves to have his person, his family and his goods protected. They\r\npromised me readily to do it, and have written accordingly; I trust it\r\nwill be with effect. I could not avoid enclosing you the letter from\r\nMonsieur Bouebé, though I have satisfied him he is to expect nothing from\r\nCongress for his inventions. These are better certified than most of those\r\nthings are; but if time stamps their worth, time will give them to us.\r\nHe expects no further answer. The gazettes of Leyden and France to this\r\ndate accompany this, which will be delivered you by the Count de Moustier,\r\nPlenipotentiary from this country.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, October 8, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The bearer hereof, the Count de Moustier, successor to Monsieur\r\nde La Luzerne, would, from his office, need no letter of introduction\r\nto you or to anybody. Yet I take the liberty of recommending him to\r\nyou, to shorten those formal approaches, which the same office would\r\notherwise expose him to, in making your acquaintance. He is a great\r\nenemy to formality, etiquette, ostentation and luxury. He goes with\r\nthe best dispositions to cultivate society, without poisoning it by ill\r\nexample. He is sensible, disposed to view things favorably, and being well\r\nacquainted with the constitution of England, her manners and language, is\r\nthe better prepared for his station with us. But I should have performed\r\nonly the lesser, and least pleasing half of my task, were I not to add\r\nmy recommendations of Madame de Brehan. She is goodness itself. You must\r\nbe well acquainted with her. You will find her well disposed to meet\r\nyour acquaintance, and well worthy of it. The way to please her, is to\r\nreceive her as an acquaintance of a thousand years standing. She speaks\r\nlittle English. You must teach her more, and learn French from her. She\r\nhopes, by accompanying Monsieur de Moustier, to improve her health, which\r\nis very feeble, and still more, to improve her son in his education,\r\nand to remove him to a distance from the seductions of this country. You\r\nwill wonder to be told, that there are no schools in this country to be\r\ncompared to ours, in the sciences. The husband of Madame de Brehan is\r\nan officer, and obliged by the times to remain with the army. Monsieur\r\nde Moustier brings your watch. I have worn it two months, and really\r\nfind it a most incomparable one. It will not want the little re-dressing\r\nwhich new watches generally do, after going about a year. It costs six\r\nhundred livres. To open it in all its parts, press the little pin on the\r\nedge, with the point of your nail; that opens the crystal; then open the\r\ndial-plate in the usual way; then press the stem, at the end within the\r\nloop, and it opens the back for winding up or regulating.\r\n\r\nDe Moustier is remarkably communicative. With adroitness he may be pumped\r\nof anything. His openness is from character, not from affectation. An\r\nintimacy with him may, on this account, be politically valuable. I am,\r\ndear Sir, your affectionate friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                        (Private.)  PARIS, October 8, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The Count de Moustier, Minister Plenipotentiary from the Court\r\nof Versailles to the United States, will have the honor of delivering\r\nyou this. The connection of your offices will necessarily connect you\r\nin acquaintance; but I beg leave to present him to you, on account of\r\nhis personal as well as his public character. You will find him open,\r\ncommunicative, candid, simple in his manners, and a declared enemy to\r\nostentation and luxury. He goes with a resolution to add no aliment to it\r\nby his example, unless he finds that the dispositions of our countrymen\r\nrequire it indispensably. Permit me, at the same time, to solicit your\r\nfriendly notice, and through you, that also of Mrs. Jay, to Madame la\r\nMarquise de Brehan, sister-in-law to Monsieur de Moustier. She accompanies\r\nhim, in hopes that a change of climate may assist her feeble health, and\r\nalso, that she may procure a more valuable education for her son, and\r\nsafer from seduction, in America than in France. I think it impossible\r\nto find a better woman, more amiable, more modest, more simple in her\r\nmanners, dress, and way of thinking. She will deserve the friendship of\r\nMrs. Jay, and the way to obtain hers, is to receive her and treat her\r\nwithout the shadow of etiquette.\r\n\r\nThe Count d'Aranda leaves us in a day or two. He desired me to recall him\r\nto your recollection, and to assure you of his friendship. In a letter\r\nwhich I mean as a private one, I may venture details too minute for a\r\npublic one, yet not unamusing, or unsatisfactory. I may venture names,\r\ntoo, without the danger of their getting into a newspaper. There has long\r\nbeen a division in the Council here, on the question of war and peace.\r\nMonsieur de Montmorin and Monsieur de Breteuil have been constantly for\r\nwar. They are supported in this by the Queen. The King goes for nothing.\r\nHe hunts one half the day, is drunk the other, and signs whatever he\r\nis bid. The Archbishop of Thoulouse desires peace. Though brought in\r\nby the Queen, he is opposed to her in this capital object, which would\r\nproduce an alliance with her brother. Whether the Archbishop will yield\r\nor not, I know not. But an intrigue is already begun for ousting him\r\nfrom his place, and it is rather probable it will succeed. He is a good\r\nand patriotic minister for peace, and very capable in the department\r\nof finance. At least, he is so in theory. I have heard his talents for\r\nexecution censured. Can I be useful here to Mrs. Jay or yourself, in\r\nexecuting any commissions, great or small? I offer you my services with\r\ngreat cordiality. You know whether any of the wines in this country may\r\nattract your wishes. In my tour, last spring, I visited the best vineyards\r\nof Burgundy, Cote-rotie, Hermitage, Lunelle, Frontignan, and white and red\r\nBordeaux, got acquainted with the proprietors, and can procure for you the\r\nbest crops from the vigneron himself. Mrs. Jay knows if there is anything\r\nelse here, in which I could be useful to her. Command me without ceremony,\r\nas it will give me real pleasure to serve you, and be assured of the\r\nsincere attachment and friendship, with which I am, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR LE COMTE DE MOUSTIER.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, October 9, 1787.\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson has the honor of presenting his respects to Monsieur le\r\nComte de Moustier, and of taking leave of him by letter, which he is\r\nprevented doing in person, by an unexpected visit to Versailles to-day.\r\nHe will hope to have the pleasure of sometimes hearing from him, and\r\nwill take the liberty occasionally, of troubling him with a letter. He\r\nconsiders the Count de Moustier as forming, with himself, the two end\r\nlinks of that chain which holds the two nations together, and is happy\r\nto have observed in him dispositions to strengthen rather than to weaken\r\nit. It is a station of importance, as on the cherishing good dispositions\r\nand quieting bad ones, will depend, in some degree, the happiness and\r\nprosperity of the two countries. The Count de Moustier will find the\r\naffections of the Americans with France, but their habits with England.\r\nChained to that country by circumstances, embracing what they loathe, they\r\nrealize the fable of the living and the dead bound together. Mr. Jefferson\r\ntroubles the Count de Moustier with two letters, to gentlemen whom he\r\nwishes to recommend to his particular acquaintance, and to that of Madame\r\nde Brehan. He bids Monsieur de Moustier a most friendly adieu, and wishes\r\nhim everything which may render agreeable his passage across the water,\r\nand his residence beyond it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MADAME DE BREHAN.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, October 9, 1787.\r\n\r\nPersuaded, Madam, that visits at this moment must be troublesome, I beg\r\nyou to accept my adieus in this form. Be assured, that no one mingles\r\nwith them more regret at separating from you. I will ask your permission\r\nto enquire of you by letter sometimes, how our country agrees with your\r\nhealth and your expectations, and will hope to hear it from yourself. The\r\nimitation of European manners, which you will find in our towns, will, I\r\nfear, be little pleasing. I beseech you to practice still your own, which\r\nwill furnish them a model of what is perfect. Should you be singular, it\r\nwill be by excellence, and after awhile you will see the effect of your\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nHeaven bless you, Madam, and guard you under all circumstances; give you\r\nsmooth waters, gentle breezes, and clear skies, hushing all its elements\r\ninto peace, and leading with its own hand the favored bark, till it shall\r\nhave safely landed its precious charge on the shores of our new world.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. LIMOZIN.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, October 9, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your favor with my account balance 160_l._\r\n7_s._, which shall be paid to your order. I observe it is supposed with\r\nyou that the differences between the courts of London and St. Cloud are\r\nnearly settled. But be assured on the contrary, that no accommodation is\r\nexpected, and that war is as certain as it can be, without being actually\r\ncommenced or declared. There remains indeed, a possibility of preventing\r\nit, but it is very feeble. This court would be disposed to do it, but they\r\nbelieve that of London decided on war. We cannot foresee the moment it\r\nwill commence, but it is not distant, according to present appearances. M.\r\nde Suffrein is appointed to command on the Ocean, and M. Albert de Rion on\r\nthe Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with much respect, Sir, your most obedient humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DUMAS.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, October 14, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your favors of October the 23d and 26th. With\r\nrespect to the mission you suggest in the former, no powers are lodged in\r\nthe hands of Mr. Adams and myself. Congress commissioned Mr. Adams, Dr.\r\nFranklin and myself, to treat with the Emperor on the subject of amity\r\nand commerce; at the same time, they gave us the commission to Prussia,\r\nwith which you are acquainted. We proposed treating through the imperial\r\nambassador here. It was declined on their part, and our powers expired,\r\nhaving been given but for two years. Afterwards, the same ambassador here\r\nwas instructed to offer to treat with us. I informed him our powers were\r\nexpired, but that I would write to Congress on the subject. I did so, but\r\nhave never yet received an answer. Whether this proceeds from a change\r\nof opinion in them, or from the multiplicity of their occupations, I am\r\nunable to say; but this state of facts will enable you to see that we\r\nhave no powers in this instance, to take the measures you had thought of.\r\nI sincerely sympathise with you in your sufferings. Though forbidden by\r\nmy character, to meddle in the internal affairs of an allied State, it is\r\nthe wish of my heart that their troubles may have such an issue, as will\r\nsecure the greatest degree of happiness to the body of the people; for it\r\nis with the mass of the nation we are allied, and not merely with their\r\ngovernors. To inform the minds of the people, and to follow their will,\r\nis the chief duty of those placed at their head. What party in your late\r\nstruggles was most likely to do this, you are more competent to judge than\r\nI am. Under every event, that you may be safe and happy, is the sincere\r\nwish of him, who has the honor to be, with sentiments of great esteem,\r\nSir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MADAME DE CORNY.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, October 18, 1787.\r\n\r\nI now have the honor, Madam, to send you the Memoire of M. de Calonnes.\r\nDo not injure yourself by hurrying its perusal. Only, when you shall\r\nhave read it at your ease, be so good as to send it back, that it may\r\nbe returned to the Duke of Dorset. You will read it with pleasure. It\r\nhas carried comfort to my heart, because it must do the same to the\r\nKing and the nation. Though it does not prove M. de Calonnes to be more\r\ninnocent than his predecessors, it shows him not to have been that\r\nexaggerated scoundrel, which the calculations and the clamors of the\r\npublic have supposed. It shows that the public treasures have not been so\r\ninconceivably squandered, as the parliaments of Grenoble, Thoulouse, &c.,\r\nhad affirmed. In fine, it shows him less wicked, and France less badly\r\ngoverned, than I had feared. In examining my little collection of books,\r\nto see what it could furnish you on the subject of Poland, I find a small\r\npiece which may serve as a supplement to the history I had sent you. It\r\ncontains a mixture of history and politics, which I think you will like.\r\n\r\nHow do you do this morning? I have feared you exerted and exposed yourself\r\ntoo much yesterday. I ask you the question, though I shall not await its\r\nanswer. The sky is clearing, and I shall away to my hermitage. God bless\r\nyou, my dear Madam, now and always. Adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE MONTMORIN.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, October 23, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I take the liberty of troubling your Excellency on the subject of\r\nthe _Arret_ which has lately appeared, for prohibiting the importation\r\nof whale oils and spermaceti, the produce of foreign fisheries. This\r\nprohibition being expressed in general terms, seems to exclude the whale\r\noils of the United States of America, as well as of the nations of Europe.\r\nThe uniform disposition, however, which his Majesty and his ministers have\r\nshown to promote the commerce between France and the United States, by\r\nencouraging our productions to come hither, and particularly those of our\r\nfisheries, induces me to hope, that these were not within their view, at\r\nthe passing of this _Arret_. I am led the more into this opinion, when I\r\nrecollect the assiduity exercised for several months, in the year 1785,\r\nby the committee appointed by government to investigate the objects of\r\ncommerce of the two countries, and to report the encouragements of which\r\nit was susceptible; the result of that investigation, which his Majesty's\r\nComptroller General did me the honor to communicate, in a letter of the\r\n22d of October, 1786, stating therein the principles which should be\r\nestablished for the future regulations of that commerce, and particularly\r\ndistinguishing the articles of whale oils by an abatement of the duties\r\non them for the present, and a promise of further abatement after the year\r\n1790; the thorough re-investigation with which Monsieur de Lambert honored\r\nthis subject, when the letter of 1786 was to be put into the form of an\r\n_Arret_; that _Arret_ itself, bearing date the 29th of December last,\r\nwhich ultimately confirmed the abatements of duty present and future,\r\nand declared that his Majesty reserved to himself to grant other favors\r\nto that production, if on further information, he should find it for the\r\ninterest of the two nations; and finally, the letter in which Monsieur\r\nde Lambert did me the honor to enclose the _Arret_, and to assure me,\r\nthat the duties which had been levied on our whale oils, contrary to\r\nthe intention of the letter of 1786, should be restored. On a review,\r\nthen, of all these circumstances, I cannot but presume, that it has not\r\nbeen intended to reverse, in a moment, views so maturely digested, and\r\nuniformly pursued; and that the general expressions of the _Arret_ of\r\nSeptember the 28th had within their contemplation the nations of Europe\r\nonly. This presumption is further strengthened by having observed, that\r\nin the treaties of commerce, made since the epoch of our independence,\r\nthe _jura gentis amicissimæ_ conceded to other nations, are expressly\r\nrestrained to those of the \"most favored _European_ nation;\" his Majesty\r\nwisely foreseeing, that it would be expedient to regulate the commerce of\r\na nation, which brings nothing but raw materials to employ the industry\r\nof his subjects, very differently from that of the European nations,\r\nwho bring mostly what has already passed through all the stages of\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\nOn these circumstances, I take the liberty of asking information from\r\nyour Excellency, as to the extent of the late _Arret_; and if I have\r\nnot been mistaken in supposing it did not mean to abridge that of\r\nDecember the 29th, I would solicit an explanatory _Arret_, to prevent the\r\nmisconstructions of it, which will otherwise take place. It is much to be\r\ndesired, too, that this explanation could be given as soon as possible, in\r\norder that it may be handed out with the _Arret_ of September the 28th.\r\nGreat alarm may otherwise spread among the merchants and adventurers\r\nin the fisheries, who, confiding in the stability of regulations, which\r\nhis Majesty's wisdom had so long and well matured, have embarked their\r\nfortunes in speculations in this branch of business.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the subject to one of the principal members of our\r\nUnion induces me to attend with great anxiety, the re-assurance from your\r\nExcellency, that no change has taken place in his Majesty's views on this\r\nsubject; and that his dispositions to multiply, rather than diminish the\r\ncombinations of interest between the two people, continue unaltered.\r\n\r\nCommerce is slow in changing its channel. That between this country\r\nand the United States, is as yet but beginning; and this beginning has\r\nreceived some checks. The _Arret_ in question would be a considerable one,\r\nwithout the explanation I have the honor to ask. I am persuaded, that\r\na continuation of the dispositions which have been hitherto manifested\r\ntowards us, will insure effects, political and commercial, of value to\r\nboth nations.\r\n\r\nI have had too many proofs of the friendly interest your Excellency\r\nis pleased to take, in whatever may strengthen the bands and connect\r\nthe views of the two countries, to doubt your patronage of the present\r\napplication; or to pretermit any occasion of repeating assurances of those\r\nsentiments of high respect and esteem with which I have the honor to be,\r\nyour Excellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR L'ABBE DE MORELLET.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, Oct. 24, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I wish it were in my power to announce to the Count de Cambrai that\r\nthe Treasury Board of the United States had enabled their banker here\r\nto answer the demands of the foreign officers. But it is not. As soon as\r\nI knew that there was a deficiency of money to pay the interest of this\r\ndemand, I informed the Treasury Board of it. They answered me they would\r\nsupply the necessary fund as soon as it should be in their power; and I\r\nam persuaded they have not failed in inclination to do it. Of this I had\r\nthe honor to notify the Count de Cambrai the last year. It is not unknown\r\nto you that the part of our new machine of government which works the\r\nworst, is that which respects the raising money; and it is that which\r\nhas occasioned the late attempts to amend our confederation. Foreseeing\r\nthat our Treasury Board might not be able to remit money from America, I\r\nsuggested to Congress the expediency of borrowing money in Holland to pay\r\noff the foreign officers. And in the month of July last, being assured\r\nthey could command the money in Holland, I pressed a more particular\r\nproposition to this purpose. As I do not foresee any possible objection\r\nto the proposition I made them, I think myself sure of their acceding to\r\nit, and that I may receive news of it in the month of December. I may\r\nbe disappointed as to the time of receiving their answer, because the\r\ncourse of their business is slow; but I do not apprehend it will be much\r\nretarded, and still less that they will refuse it altogether. The moment\r\nI receive an answer, the Count de Cambrai may be assured it shall be\r\ncommunicated to him. In doing this I shall gratify not only my personal\r\nfriendship for him, but also those sentiments of particular esteem\r\nand attachment with which I have the honor to be, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE J. JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, Oct. 27, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--When I had the honor of addressing you on the 8th instant, the\r\nappearances of war were such, that no one would have been surprised to\r\nhear that hostilities were actually commenced at sea. The preparations\r\nwere pushed with such vivacity on the part of England, that it was\r\nbelieved she had other objects in view than those she spoke out. However,\r\nhaving protected by her countenance the establishment of the Stadtholder\r\nby the Prussian troops, and completely detached the Court of Berlin from\r\nthat of Versailles, she made a proposition to the latter to disarm, which\r\nwas agreed to. Mutual declarations for this purpose were signed last night\r\nat Versailles, of which I have now the honor to enclose you copies.\r\n\r\nCommissaries are to be appointed on each side to see that the disarming\r\ntakes place. The Count de Moustier having been detained at Brest a\r\nfortnight by contrary wind, and this continuing obstinately in the same\r\npoint, admits a possibility that this letter may yet reach Brest before\r\nhis departure. It passes through the post office and will be opened and\r\nread of course. I shall have the honor of addressing you more fully a week\r\nhence by a private hand. I have now that of assuring you of the sincerity\r\nof that esteem and respect with which I have honor to be, Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, November 3, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--My last letters to you were of the 8th and 27th of October. In the\r\nformer, I mentioned to you the declaration of this country, that they\r\nwould interpose with force, if the Prussian troops entered Holland; the\r\nentry of those troops into Holland; the declaration of England, that if\r\nFrance did oppose force, they would consider it as an act of war; the\r\nnaval armaments on both sides; the nomination of the Bailli de Suffrein\r\nas Generalissimo on the ocean; and the cold reception of Mr. Granville\r\nhere, with his conciliatory propositions, as so many symptoms which seemed\r\nto indicate a certain and immediate rupture. It was indeed universally\r\nand hourly expected. But the King of Prussia, a little before these last\r\nevents, got wind of the alliance on the carpet between France and the two\r\nempires; he awaked to the situation in which that would place him; he made\r\nsome applications to the court of St. Petersburg, to divert the Empress\r\nfrom the proposed alliance, and supplicated the court of London not to\r\nabandon him. That court had also received a hint of the same project;\r\nboth seemed to suspect, for the first time, that it would be possible for\r\nFrance to abandon the Turks, and that they were likely to get more than\r\nthey had played for at Constantinople; for they had meant nothing more\r\nthere, than to divert the Empress and Emperor from the affairs of the\r\nwest, by employing them in the east, and at the same time, to embroil them\r\nwith France as the patroness of the Turks. The court of London engaged not\r\nto abandon Prussia: but both of them relaxed a little the tone of their\r\nproceedings. The King of Prussia sent a Mr. Alvensleben here expressly\r\nto explain and soothe: the King of England, notwithstanding the cold\r\nreception of his propositions by Grenville, renewed conferences here\r\nthrough Eden and the Duke of Dorset. The minister, in the affection of\r\nhis heart for peace, readily joined in conference, and a declaration and\r\ncounter-declaration were cooked up at Versailles, and sent to London for\r\napprobation. They were approved, arrived here at one o'clock the 27th,\r\nwere signed that night at Versailles, and on the next day, I had the honor\r\nof enclosing them to you, under cover to the Count de Moustier, whom\r\nI supposed still at Brest, dating my letter as of the 27th, by mistake\r\nfor the 28th. Lest, however, these papers should not have got to Brest\r\nbefore the departure of the Count de Moustier, I now enclose you other\r\ncopies. The English declaration states a notification of this court, in\r\nSeptember, by Barthelemy, their minister at London, \"that they would send\r\nsuccours into Holland,\" as the first cause of England's arming; desires\r\nan explanation of the intentions of this court, as to the affairs of\r\nHolland, and proposes to disarm; on condition, however, that the King of\r\nFrance shall not retain any hostile views in any quarter, for what has\r\nbeen done in Holland. This last phrase was to secure Prussia, according to\r\npromise. The King of France acknowledges the notification by his minister\r\nat London, promises he will do nothing in consequence of it, declares he\r\nhas no intention to intermeddle with force in the affairs of Holland, and\r\nthat he will entertain hostile views in no quarter, for what has been done\r\nthere. He disavows having ever had any intention to interpose with force\r\nin the affairs of that republic. This disavowal begins the sentence, which\r\nacknowledges he had notified the contrary to the court of London, and it\r\nincludes no apology to soothe the feelings which may be excited in the\r\nbreasts of the Patriots of Holland, at hearing the King declare he never\r\ndid intend to aid them with force, when promises to do this were the basis\r\nof those very attempts to better their constitution, which have ended in\r\nits ruin, as well as their own.\r\n\r\nI have analyzed these declarations, because, being somewhat wrapped up in\r\ntheir expressions, their full import might escape, on a transient reading;\r\nand it is necessary it should not escape. It conveys to us the important\r\nlesson, that no circumstances of morality, honor, interest, or engagement,\r\nare sufficient to authorize a secure reliance on any nation, at all times,\r\nand in all positions. A moment of difficulty, or a moment of error, may\r\nrender forever useless the most friendly dispositions in the King, in\r\nthe major part of his ministers, and the whole of his nation. The present\r\npacification is considered by most as only a short truce. They calculate\r\non the spirit of the nation, and not on the agued hand which guides its\r\nmovements. It is certain, that from this moment the whole system of Europe\r\nchanges. Instead of counting together England, Austria, and Russia, as\r\nheretofore, against France, Spain, Holland, Prussia, and Turkey, the\r\ndivision will probably be, England, Holland, and Prussia, against France,\r\nAustria, Russia, and perhaps Spain. This last power is not sure, because\r\nthe dispositions of its heir apparent are not sure. But whether the\r\npresent be truce or peace, it will allow time to mature the conditions of\r\nthe alliance between France and the two empires, always supposed to be on\r\nthe carpet. It is thought to be obstructed by the avidity of the Emperor,\r\nwho would swallow a good part of Turkey, Silesia, Bavaria, and the rights\r\nof the Germanic body. To the two or three first articles, France might\r\nconsent, receiving in gratification a well-rounded portion of the Austrian\r\nNetherlands, with the islands of Candia, Cyprus, Rhodes, and perhaps lower\r\nEgypt. But all this is in embryo, uncertainly known, and counterworked by\r\nthe machinations of the courts of London and Berlin.\r\n\r\nThe following solution of the British armaments is supposed in a letter of\r\nthe 25th ultimo, from Colonel Blachden of Connecticut, now at Dunkirk, to\r\nthe Marquis de La Fayette. I will cite it in his own words:--\"A gentleman\r\nwho left London two days ago, and came to this place to-day, informs me\r\nthat it is now generally supposed that Mr. Pitt's great secret, which\r\nhas puzzled the whole nation so long, and to accomplish which design the\r\nwhole force of the nation is armed, is to make a vigorous effort for\r\nthe recovery of America. When I recollect the delay they have made in\r\ndelivering the forts in America, and that little more than a year ago, one\r\nof the British ministry wrote to the King a letter, in which were these\r\nremarkable words, 'if your Majesty pleases, America may yet be yours;' add\r\nto this, if it were possible for the present ministry in England to effect\r\nsuch a matter, they would secure their places and their power for a long\r\ntime, and should they fail in the end, they would be certain of holding\r\nthem during the attempt, which it is in their power to prolong as much\r\nas they please, and, at all events, they would boast of having endeavored\r\nthe recovery of what a former ministry had abandoned--it is possible.\" A\r\nsimilar surmise has come in a letter from a person in Rotterdam to one at\r\nthis place. I am satisfied that the King of England believes the mass of\r\nour people to be tired of their independence, and desirous of returning\r\nunder his government; and that the same opinion prevails in the ministry\r\nand nation. They have hired their newswriters to repeat this lie in their\r\ngazettes so long, that they have become the dupes of it themselves. But\r\nthere is no occasion to recur to this, in order to account for their\r\narming. A more rational purpose avowed, that purpose executed, and when\r\nexecuted, a solemn agreement to disarm, seem to leave no doubt that the\r\nre-establishment of the Stadtholder was their object. Yet it is possible,\r\nthat having found that this court will not make war in this moment for any\r\nally, new views may arise, and they may think the moment favorable for\r\nexecuting any purposes they may have, in our quarter. Add to this, that\r\nreason is of no aid in calculating their movements. We are, therefore,\r\nnever safe till our magazines are filled with arms. The present season\r\nof truce or peace, should, in my opinion, be improved without a moment's\r\nrespite, to effect this essential object, and no means be omitted, by\r\nwhich money may be obtained for the purpose. I say this, however, with\r\ndue deference to the opinion of Congress, who are better judges of the\r\nnecessity and practicability of the measure.\r\n\r\nI mentioned to you, in a former letter, the application I had made to the\r\nDutch ambassadors and Prussian envoy, for the protection of Mr. Dumas.\r\nThe latter soon after received an assurance, that he was put under the\r\nprotection of the States of Holland; and the Dutch ambassador called on\r\nme a few days ago, to inform me, by instruction from his constituents,\r\n\"that the States General had received a written application from Mr.\r\nAdams, praying their protection of Dumas; that they had instructed their\r\n_greffier_, Fagel, to assure Mr. Adams, by letter, that he was under\r\nthe protection of the States of Holland; but to inform him, at the same\r\ntime, that Mr. Dumas' conduct, out of the line of his office, had been so\r\nextraordinary, that they would expect de l'honnêteté de Mr. Adams, that\r\nhe would charge some other person with the affairs of the United States,\r\nduring his absence.\"\r\n\r\nYour letter of September the 8th, has been duly received. I shall pay\r\ndue attention to the instructions relative to the medals, and give any\r\naid I can in the case of Boss' vessel. As yet, however, my endeavors to\r\nfind Monsieur Pauly, _avocat au conseil d'etat_, _rue Coquilliere_, have\r\nbeen ineffectual. There is no such person living in that street. I found\r\na Monsieur Pauly, _avocat au parlement_, in another part of the town; he\r\nopened the letter, but said it could not mean him. I shall advertise in\r\nthe public papers. If that fails, there will be no other chance of finding\r\nhim. Mr. Warnum will do well, therefore, to send some other description by\r\nwhich the person may be found. Indeed, some friend of the party interested\r\nshould be engaged to follow up this business, as it will require constant\r\nattention, and probably a much larger sum of money than that named in the\r\nbill enclosed in Mr. Warnum's letter.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to enclose you a letter from O'Bryan to me, containing\r\ninformation from Algiers, and one from Mr. Montgomery, at Alicant. The\r\npurpose of sending you this last, is to show you how much the difficulties\r\nof ransom are increased since the Spanish negotiations. The Russian\r\ncaptives have cost about eight thousand livres apiece, on an average. I\r\ncertainly have no idea that we should give any such sum; and, therefore,\r\nif it should be the sense of Congress to give such a price, I would be\r\nglad to know it by instruction. My idea is, that we should not ransom, but\r\non the footing of the nation which pays least, that it may be as little\r\nworth their while to go in pursuit of us, as any nation. This is cruelty\r\nto the individuals now in captivity, but kindness to the hundreds that\r\nwould soon be so, were we to make it worth the while of those pirates\r\nto go out of the Straits in quest of us. As soon as money is provided,\r\nI shall put this business into train. I have taken measures to damp at\r\nAlgiers all expectations of our proposing to ransom, at any price. I feel\r\nthe distress which this must occasion to our countrymen there, and their\r\nconnections; but the object of it is their ultimate good, by bringing down\r\ntheir holders to such a price as we ought to pay, instead of letting them\r\nremain in such expectations as cannot be gratified. The gazettes of France\r\nand Leyden accompany this.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_The annexed are translations of the declaration and counter-\r\n       declaration, referred to in the preceding letter._]\r\n\r\nDECLARATION.\r\n\r\nThe events which have taken place in the republic of the United provinces,\r\nappearing no longer to leave any subject of discussion, and still less of\r\ndispute, between the two courts, the undersigned are authorized to ask,\r\nif it be the intention of his most Christian Majesty to act in pursuance\r\nof the notification given, on the 16th of last month, by the Minister\r\nPlenipotentiary of his most Christian Majesty, which, announcing his\r\npurpose of aiding Holland, has occasioned maritime armaments on the part\r\nof his Majesty, which armaments have become reciprocal.\r\n\r\nIf the court of Versailles is disposed to explain itself on this subject,\r\nand on the conduct adopted towards the republic, in a manner conformably\r\nto the desire evinced by each party, to preserve a good understanding\r\nbetween the two courts, it being also understood, at the same time, that\r\nno hostile view is entertained in any quarter, in consequence of the past;\r\nhis Majesty, always eager to manifest his concurrence in the friendly\r\nsentiments of his most Christian Majesty, agrees forthwith that the\r\narmaments, and, in general, all preparations for war, shall be mutually\r\ndiscontinued, and that the marines of the two nations shall be placed\r\non the footing of a peace establishment, such as existed on the first of\r\nJanuary of the present year.\r\n\r\n                                                       Signed.{DORSET.\r\n                                                              {WM.

Barthelemy, having had\r\nno other object than to announce to that court an intention, the motives\r\nof which no longer exist, _especially since the King of Prussia has made\r\nknown his resolution_, his Majesty makes no difficulty in declaring, that\r\nhe has no wish to act in pursuance of the communication aforesaid, and\r\nthat he entertains no hostile view in any quarter, relative to what has\r\npassed in Holland.\r\n\r\nConsequently, his Majesty, desiring to concur in the sentiments of his\r\nBritannic Majesty, for the preservation of a good understanding between\r\nthe two courts, consents with pleasure to the proposition of his Britannic\r\nMajesty, that the armaments, and, in general, all preparations for war,\r\nshall be mutually discontinued, and that the marines of the two nations\r\nshall be replaced upon the footing of the peace establishment, as it\r\nexisted on the first day of January of the present year.\r\n\r\n                                                         Signed. MONTMORIN.\r\n\r\n     At Versailles, the 27th of October, 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                       (Private.)  PARIS, November 3, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I shall take the liberty of confiding sometimes to a private\r\nletter such details of the small history of the court or cabinet, as may\r\nbe worthy of being known, and yet not proper to be publicly communicated.\r\nI doubt whether the administration is yet in a permanent form. The\r\nCount de Montmorin and Baron de Breteuil are, I believe, firm enough in\r\ntheir places. It was doubted whether they would wait for the Count de La\r\nLuzerne, if the war had taken place; but at present, I suppose they will.\r\nI wish it also, because M. de Hector, his only competitor, has on some\r\noccasions shown little value for the connection with us. Lambert, the\r\nComptroller General, is thought to be very insecure. I should be sorry\r\nalso to lose him. I have worked several days with him, the Marquis de\r\nLa Fayette, and Monsieur du Pont, (father of the young gentleman gone to\r\nAmerica with the Count de Moustier) to reduce into one _Arret_, whatever\r\nconcerned our commerce. I have found him a man of great judgment and\r\napplication, possessing good general principles on subjects of commerce,\r\nand friendly dispositions towards us. He passed the _Arret_ in a very\r\nfavorable form, but it has been opposed in the Council, and will, I fear,\r\nsuffer some alteration in the article of whale oil. That of tobacco,\r\nwhich was put into a separate instrument, experiences difficulties also,\r\nwhich do not come from him. M. du Pont has rendered us essential service\r\non these occasions. I wish his son could be so well noticed, as to make\r\na favorable report to his father; he would, I think, be gratified by it,\r\nand his good dispositions be strengthened, and rendered further useful to\r\nus. Whether I shall be able to send you these regulations by the present\r\npacket, will depend on their getting through the Council in time. The\r\nArchbishop continues well with his patroness. Her object is, a close\r\nconnection with her brother. I suppose he convinces her, that peace will\r\nfurnish the best occasion of cementing that connection.\r\n\r\nIt may not be uninstructive, to give you the origin and nature of\r\nhis influence with the Queen. When the Duke de Choiseul proposed the\r\nmarriage of the Dauphin with this lady, he thought it proper to send a\r\nperson to Vienna, to perfect her in the language. He asked his friend,\r\nthe Archbishop of Thoulouse, to recommend to him a proper person. He\r\nrecommended a certain Abbé. The Abbé, from his first arrival at Vienna,\r\neither tutored by his patron, or prompted by gratitude, impressed on\r\nthe Queen's mind, the exalted talents and merit of the Archbishop, and\r\ncontinually represented him as the only man fit to be placed at the helm\r\nof affairs. On his return to Paris, being retained near the person of\r\nthe Queen, he kept him constantly in her view. The Archbishop was named\r\nof the Assembly des Notables, had occasion enough there to prove his\r\ntalents, and Count de Vergennes, his great enemy, dying opportunely, the\r\nQueen got him into place. He uses the Abbé even yet, for instilling all\r\nhis notions into her mind. That he has imposing talents and patriotic\r\ndispositions, I think is certain. Good judges think him a theorist only,\r\nlittle acquainted with the details of business, and spoiling all his\r\nplans by a bungled execution. He may perhaps undergo a severe trial. His\r\nbest actions are exciting against him a host of enemies, particularly\r\nthe reduction of the pensions, and reforms in other branches of economy.\r\nSome think the other ministers are willing he should stay in, till he has\r\neffected this odious, yet necessary work, and that they will then make him\r\nthe scape-goat of the transaction. The declarations too, which I send you\r\nin my public letter, if they should become public, will probably raise an\r\nuniversal cry. It will all fall on him, because Montmorin and Breteuil\r\nsay, without reserve, that the sacrifice of the Dutch has been against\r\ntheir advice. He will, perhaps, not permit these declarations to appear\r\nin this country. They are absolutely unknown; they were communicated to\r\nme by the Duke of Dorset, and I believe no other copy has been given here.\r\nThey will be published doubtless in England, as a proof of their triumph,\r\nand may thence make their way into this country. If the Premier can stem\r\na few months, he may remain long in office, and will never make war if he\r\ncan help it. If he should be removed, the peace will probably be short.\r\nHe is solely chargeable with the loss of Holland. True, they could not\r\nhave raised money by taxes, to supply the necessities of war; but could\r\nthey do it were their finances ever so well arranged? No nation makes war\r\nnow-a-days, but by the aid of loans; and it is probable, that in a war\r\nfor the liberties of Holland, all the treasures of that country would have\r\nbeen at their service. They have now lost the cow which furnishes the milk\r\nof war. She will be on the side of their enemies, whenever a rupture shall\r\ntake place; and no arrangement of their finances can countervail this\r\ncircumstance.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt, you permit access to the letters of your foreign\r\nministers, by persons only of the most perfect trust. It is in the\r\nEuropean system, to bribe the clerks high, in order to obtain copies of\r\ninteresting papers. I am sure you are equally attentive to the conveyance\r\nof your letters to us, as you know that all are opened that pass through\r\nany post-office of Europe. Your letters which come by the packet, if put\r\ninto the mail at New York, or into the post-office at Havre, wear proofs\r\nthat they have been opened. The passenger to whom they are confided,\r\nshould be cautioned always to keep them in his own hands, till he can\r\ndeliver them personally in Paris.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with very sincere esteem and respect, dear Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE MONTMORIN.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, November 6, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I take the liberty of asking your Excellency's perusal of the\r\nenclosed case of an American hostage, confined in the prisons of Dunkirk.\r\nHis continuance there seems to be useless, and yet endless. Not knowing\r\nhow far the government can interfere for his relief, as it is a case\r\nwherein private property is concerned, I do not presume to ask his\r\nliberation absolutely; but I will solicit from your Excellency such\r\nmeasures in his behalf, as the laws and usages of the country may permit.\r\n\r\nThe Comptroller General having been so good as to explain to me in a\r\nconversation that he wished to know what duties were levied in England on\r\nAmerican whale oil, I have had the honor of informing him by letter, that\r\nthe ancient duties on that article are seventeen pounds, six shillings and\r\nsix pence, sterling, the ton, and that some late additional duties make\r\nthem amount to about eighteen pounds sterling. That the common whale oil\r\nsells there but for about twenty pounds sterling, the ton, and of course\r\nthe duty amounts to a prohibition. This duty was originally laid on all\r\nforeign fish oil, with a view to favor the British and American fisheries.\r\nWhen we became independent, and, of course, foreign to great Britain,\r\nwe became subject to the foreign duty. No duty, therefore, which France\r\nmay think proper to lay on this article, can drive it to the English\r\nmarket. It could only oblige the inhabitants of Nantucket to abandon\r\ntheir fishery. But the poverty of their soil offering them no other\r\nresource, they must quit their country, and either establish themselves\r\nin Nova Scotia, where, as British fishermen, they may participate of the\r\nBritish premium, in addition to the ordinary price of their whale oil,\r\nor they must accept the conditions which this government offers, for the\r\nestablishment they have proposed at Dunkirk. Your Excellency will judge,\r\nwhat conditions may counterbalance, in their minds, the circumstances of\r\nthe vicinity of Nova Scotia, sameness of language, laws, religion, customs\r\nand kindred. Remaining in their native country, to which they are most\r\nsingularly attached, excluded from commerce with England, taught to look\r\nto France as the only country from which they can derive sustenance, they\r\nwill, in case of war, become useful rovers against its enemies. Their\r\nposition, their poverty, their courage, their address and their hatred,\r\nwill render them formidable scourges on the British commerce. It is to be\r\nconsidered then, on the one hand, that the duty which M. de Calonnes had\r\nproposed to retain on their oil, may endanger the shifting this useful\r\nbody of seamen out of our joint scale into that of the British; and also\r\nmay suppress a considerable subject of exchange for the productions\r\nof France: on the other hand, that it may produce an addition to his\r\nmajesty's revenue. What I have thus far said, is on the supposition, that\r\nthe duty may operate a diminution of the price received by the fishermen.\r\nIf it act in the contrary direction, and produce an augmentation of price\r\nto the consumer, it immediately brings into competition a variety of other\r\noils, vegetable and animal, a good part of which France receives from\r\nabroad, and the fisherman thus losing his market, is compelled equally to\r\nchange either his calling or country. When M. de Calonnes first agreed\r\nto reduce the duties to what he has declared, I had great hopes the\r\ncommodity could bear them, and that it would become a medium of commerce\r\nbetween France and the United States. I must confess, however, that my\r\nexpectations have not been fulfilled, and that but little has come here\r\nas yet. This induces me to fear, that it is so poor an article, that any\r\nduty whatever will suppress it. Should this take place, and the spirit of\r\nemigration once seize those people, perhaps an abolition of all duty might\r\nthen come too late to stop, what it would now easily prevent. I fear there\r\nis danger in the experiment; and it remains for the wisdom of his Majesty\r\nand his ministers to decide, whether the prospect of gain to the revenue,\r\nor establishing a national fishery, may compensate this danger. If the\r\ngovernment should decide to retain the duty, I shall acquiesce in it\r\ncheerfully, and do everything in my power to encourage my countrymen still\r\nto continue their occupation.\r\n\r\nThe actual session of our several legislatures would render it interesting\r\nto forward immediately the regulations proposed on our commerce; and the\r\nexpiration of the order of Bernis, at the close of this month, endangers a\r\nsuspension and derangement in the commerce of tobacco, very embarrassing\r\nto the merchants of the two countries. Pardon me therefore, Sir, if I\r\nappear solicitous to obtain the ultimate decision of his Majesty's Council\r\non these subjects, and to ask as early a communication of that decision,\r\nas shall be convenient.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most profound esteem and\r\nrespect, your Excellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, November 7, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--By a letter of the 2d instant, from the Count de Moustier, I\r\nperceive he is still at Brest. The wind has been now near a month in\r\nthe south-western quarter, and if it remains there a few days longer, my\r\ndespatches by the packet may reach you as soon as those by Monsieur de\r\nMoustier. This being the last post which can reach the packet, should\r\nshe sail on the 10th, I avail myself of it to inform you of the only\r\ncircumstance, since the date of my letters delivered to Mr. Stuari,\r\nworth your knowledge; that is the appointment of the Chevalier de La\r\nLuzerne, Ambassador to the Court of London. This fortunate issue of those\r\nexpectations which made him unwilling to return to America, together\r\nwith the character of his successor, will, I hope, render it pleasing to\r\nCongress that his return was not too much pressed. He would have gone back\r\nwith dispositions toward us very different from those he will carry for\r\nus to the Court of London. He has been constantly sensible that we wished\r\nhis return, and that we could have procured it, but that we did not wish\r\nto stand in the way of his promotion. He will view this as in some measure\r\nthe effect of our indulgence, and I think we may count on his patronage\r\nand assistance wherever they may be useful to us. I have the honor to be,\r\nwith sentiments of the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, November 13, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--This will be delivered you by young Mr. Rutledge. Your\r\nknowledge of his father will introduce him to your notice. He merits it\r\nmoreover, on his own account.\r\n\r\nI am now to acknowledge your favors of Oct. the 8th and 26th. That of\r\nAug. 25th was duly received, nor can I recollect by what accident I was\r\nprevented from acknowledging it in mine of Sept. the 28th. It has been\r\nthe source of my subsistence hitherto, and must continue to be so, till I\r\nreceive letters on the affairs of money from America. Van Staphorsts and\r\nWillinks have answered my drafts. Your books for the Marquis de La Fayette\r\nare received here. I will notify it to him, who is at present with his\r\nProvincial Assembly in Auvergne.\r\n\r\nLittle is said lately of the progress of the negotiations between the\r\ncourts of Petersburg, Vienna and Versailles. The distance of the former,\r\nand the cautious, unassuming character of its minister here, is one cause\r\nof delays: a greater one is, the greediness and unstable character of the\r\nEmperor. Nor do I think that the Principal here will be easily induced\r\nto lend himself to any connection, which shall threaten a war within a\r\nconsiderable number of years. His own reign will be that of peace only,\r\nin all probability; and were any accident to tumble him down, this country\r\nwould immediately gird on its sword and buckler, and trust to occurrences\r\nfor supplies of money. The wound their honor has sustained festers in\r\ntheir hearts; and it may be said with truth, that the Archbishop, and\r\na few priests determined to support his measures, because, proud to see\r\ntheir order come again into power, are the only advocates for the line\r\nof conduct which has been pursued. It is said and believed through Paris\r\nliterally, that the Count de Montmorin, \"_pleuroit comme un enfant_,\"\r\nwhen obliged to sign the counter-declaration. Considering the phrase as\r\nfigurative, I believe it expresses the distress of his heart. Indeed,\r\nhe has made no secret of his individual opinion. In the meantime, the\r\nPrincipal goes on with a firm and patriotic spirit, in reforming the\r\ncruel abuses of the government, and preparing a new constitution, which\r\nwill give to this people as much liberty as they are capable of managing.\r\nThis, I think, will be the glory of his administration, because, though\r\na good theorist in finance, he is thought to execute badly. They are\r\nabout to open a loan of one hundred millions, to supply present wants,\r\nand it is said, the preface of the _Arret_ will contain a promise of the\r\nconvocation of the States General, during the ensuing year. Twelve or\r\nfifteen Provincial Assemblies are already in action, and are going on\r\nwell; and I think, that though the nation suffers in reputation, it will\r\ngain infinitely in happiness, under the present administration. I enclose\r\nto Mr. Jay, a pamphlet which I will beg of you to forward. I leave it open\r\nfor your perusal. When you shall have read it, be so good as to stick a\r\nwafer in it. It is not yet published, nor will be for some days. This copy\r\nhas been ceded to me as a favor.\r\n\r\nHow do you like our new constitution? I confess there are things in it\r\nwhich stagger all my dispositions to subscribe to what such an Assembly\r\nhas proposed. The house of federal representatives will not be adequate\r\nto the management of affairs, either foreign or federal. Their President\r\nseems a bad edition of a Polish King. He may be elected from four years\r\nto four years, for life. Reason and experience prove to us, that a\r\nchief magistrate, so continuable, is an office for life. When one or\r\ntwo generations shall have proved that this is an office for life, it\r\nbecomes, on every occasion, worthy of intrigue, of bribery, of force, and\r\neven of foreign interference. It will be of great consequence to France\r\nand England, to have America governed by a Galloman or Angloman. Once\r\nin office, and possessing the military force of the Union, without the\r\naid or check of a council, he would not be easily dethroned, even if the\r\npeople could be induced to withdraw their votes from him. I wish that at\r\nthe end of the four years, they had made him forever ineligible a second\r\ntime. Indeed, I think all the good of this new constitution might have\r\nbeen couched in three or four new articles, to be added to the good, old\r\nand venerable fabric, which should have been preserved even as a religious\r\nrelique. Present me and my daughters affectionately to Mrs. Adams. The\r\nyounger one continues to speak of her warmly. Accept yourself, assurances\r\nof the sincere esteem and respect with which I have the honor to be, dear\r\nSir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. I am in negotiation with de La Blancharie. You shall hear from me\r\nwhen arranged.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL SMITH.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, November 13, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am now to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of October\r\nthe 4th, 8th, and 26th. In the last, you apologise for your letters\r\nof introduction to Americans coming here. It is so far from needing\r\napology on your part, that it calls for thanks on mine. I endeavor to\r\nshow civilities to all the Americans who come here, and who will give me\r\nopportunities of doing it; and it is a matter of comfort to know, from\r\na good quarter, what they are, and how far I may go in my attentions to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nCan you send me Woodmason's bills for the two copying presses for the\r\nMarquis de La Fayette and the Marquis de Chastellux? The latter makes\r\none article in a considerable account, of old standing, and which I\r\ncannot present for want of this article. I do not know whether it is\r\nto yourself or Mr. Adams, I am to give my thanks for the copy of the\r\nnew constitution. I beg leave through you to place them where due.\r\nIt will yet be three weeks before I shall receive them from America.\r\nThere are very good articles in it, and very bad. I do not know which\r\npreponderate. What we have lately read, in the history of Holland, in\r\nthe chapter on the Stadtholder, would have sufficed to set me against\r\na chief magistrate, eligible for a long duration, if I had ever been\r\ndisposed towards one; and what we have always read of the elections of\r\nPolish Kings should have forever excluded the idea of one continuable\r\nfor life. Wonderful is the effect of impudent and persevering lying. The\r\nBritish ministry have so long hired their gazetteers to repeat, and model\r\ninto every form, lies about our being in anarchy, that the world has at\r\nlength believed them, the English nation has believed them, the ministers\r\nthemselves have come to believe them, and what is more wonderful, we have\r\nbelieved them ourselves. Yet where does this anarchy exist? Where did\r\nit ever exist, except in the single instance of Massachusetts? And can\r\nhistory produce an instance of rebellion so honorably conducted? I say\r\nnothing of its motives. They were founded in ignorance, not wickedness.\r\nGod forbid we should ever be twenty years without such a rebellion.\r\nThe people cannot be all, and always, well informed. The part which\r\nis wrong will be discontented, in proportion to the importance of the\r\nfacts they misconceive. If they remain quiet under such misconceptions,\r\nit is a lethargy, the forerunner of death to the public liberty. We\r\nhave had thirteen States independent for eleven years. There has been\r\none rebellion. That comes to one rebellion in a century and a half,\r\nfor each State. What country before, ever existed a century and a half\r\nwithout a rebellion? And what country can preserve its liberties, if\r\nits rulers are not warned from time to time, that this people preserve\r\nthe spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. The remedy is to set them\r\nright as to facts, pardon and pacify them. What signify a few lives\r\nlost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from\r\ntime to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural\r\nmanure. Our convention has been too much impressed by the insurrection\r\nof Massachusetts; and on the spur of the moment, they are setting up a\r\nkite to keep the hen yard in order. I hope in God, this article will be\r\nrectified before the new constitution is accepted. You ask me if anything\r\ntranspires here on the subject of South America? Not a word. I know that\r\nthere are combustible materials there, and that they wait the torch only.\r\nBut this country probably will join the extinguishers. The want of facts\r\nworth communicating to you, has occasioned me to give a little loose to\r\ndissertation. We must be contented to amuse, when we cannot inform.\r\n\r\nPresent my respects to Mrs. Smith, and be assured of the sincere esteem\r\nof, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. JAMES MAURY.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, November 13, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received your favor of October 25, the day before yesterday\r\nonly. It would be needless for me, therefore, to add to what you already\r\nknow on the subject of peace and war. The principal minister here is\r\nso intent on domestic improvements, and on peace, as necessary to give\r\nleisure for them, that it will not be his fault, if it be disturbed again.\r\nIt will be equally unnecessary for me to give you a formal attestation\r\nof your being a citizen of the United States. Should any occasion for it\r\narise hereafter, I shall be always ready to certify it. With respect to\r\ntobacco, the contract with Mr. Morris and the order of Berni cease with\r\nthis year. I am obtaining an arrangement for the five years which yet\r\nremain of the present lease to the Farmers General, by which they will\r\nbe obliged to take all the tobacco for which they shall have occasion\r\nfrom America, except about one-fifth northern, which they represent\r\nas necessary. They will be obliged to take only such as comes directly\r\nfrom America, without having touched at any European port in _French_\r\nor _American_ bottoms, and to make the purchase in _France_. It will be\r\nparticularly watched that they purchase not a single hogshead in England.\r\nBy this I hope to have completely effected the diverting so much of the\r\ntobacco trade as amounts to their own consumption from England to France.\r\nI am glad to find, also, by your letter, that this operation will have\r\nthe effect to raise the price of this commodity at the English market.\r\n24,000 hogheads of tobacco a year, less at that market than heretofore,\r\nmust produce some change, and it could not be for the worse. The order to\r\nthe farmers will name only 14,000 hogheads a year, but it is certain they\r\nmust extend it themselves nearly or quite to 24,000, as their consumption\r\nis near 30,000. I am endeavoring to bring hither also, directly, the\r\nrice of America, consumed in this country. At present they buy it from\r\nLondon. I am of opinion they could consume the whole of what is made in\r\nAmerica, especially if the rice States will introduce the culture of the\r\nPiedmont and Egyptian rices also, both of which qualities are demanded\r\nhere in concurrence with that of Carolina. I have procured for them the\r\nseed from Egypt and Piedmont. The indulgences given to American whale oil\r\nwill ensure its coming here directly. In general, I am in hopes to ensure\r\nhere the transportation of all our commodities which come to this country\r\nin American and French bottoms exclusively, which will countervail the\r\neffect of the British navigation act on our carrying business. The returns\r\nin French instead of English manufactures, will take place by degrees.\r\nSupposing that these details cannot but be agreeable to you as a merchant\r\nand as an American, I trouble you with them; being with much sincerity,\r\nand on all occasions, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR DUMAS.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, December 9, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your letter of November 27, showing that mine of November 14, had\r\nnot then got to hand, had given me alarm for its fate, and I had sat down\r\nto write you a second acknowledgment of the receipt of your two favors of\r\nOctober 23 and 26, and to add the receipt, also, of those of November 14,\r\n22 and 27. A copy of my answer of November 14 was prepared to be enclosed\r\nto you, but in that moment came your favors of November 30, December 2d\r\nand 4th, by which I perceived that the original had at length got safe to\r\nhand. By that you have seen all that interference, direct or indirect,\r\non the part of Mr. Adams and myself in the business you had done me the\r\nhonor to suggest, would be improper. Your despatches for Mr. Jay shall go\r\nwith mine in the packet of this month. These will bring the matter into\r\nthe view of Congress. In the meantime I think it would be well to avoid\r\nexciting at Brussels or anywhere else the least expectation thereon,\r\nbecause it is impossible for us to know what that body may, in its wisdom\r\nand with all circumstances under its eye, decide should be done. They\r\nhad, in the year 1784, made up their minds as to the system of commercial\r\nprinciples they wished to pursue. These were very free. They proposed them\r\nto all the powers of Europe. All declined except Prussia. To this general\r\nopposition they may now find it necessary to present a very different\r\ngeneral system to which their treaties will form cases of exception, and\r\nthey may wish to lessen rather than multiply those cases of exception.\r\nAdd to this, that it is in contemplation to change the organization of\r\nthe federal government, and they may think it better to leave the system\r\nof foreign connection to be formed by those who are to pursue it. I only\r\nmention these as possible considerations, without pretending to know\r\nthe sentiments of that honorable body, or any one of its members on the\r\nsubject; and to show that no expectations should be raised which might\r\nembarrass them or embroil ourselves. The proposed change of government\r\nseems to be the proper topic to urge as the reason why Congress may not at\r\nthis moment choose to be forming new treaties. Should they choose it, on\r\nthe other hand, the reserve of those who act for them, while uninstructed,\r\ncannot do injury.\r\n\r\nI find the expectation very general that the present peace will be of\r\nshort duration. There are circumstances in favor of this opinion, there\r\nare others against it. Certain it is that this country is in a state so\r\nunprepared as to excite astonishment. After the last war, she seems to\r\nhave reposed on her laurels, in confidence that no power would venture to\r\ndisturb that repose.\r\n\r\nIt is presumable her present ministry will prepare to vindicate their\r\nnation and their friends. The late events have kindled a fire, which,\r\nthough smothered of necessity for the present moment, will probably never\r\nbe quenched but by signal revenge. Individuals will, in the meantime, have\r\nincurred sufferings which that may not repair. That yours may be lessened\r\nfor the present, and relieved in future, is the sincere wish of him who\r\nhas the honor to be, with sentiments of great esteem and regard, Sir, your\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, December 11, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am later in acknowledging the receipt of your favors of\r\nOctober the 15th, and November the 5th and 15th, because we have been\r\nlong expecting a packet, which I hoped would bring communications worth\r\ndetailing to you; and she arrived only a few days ago, after a very long\r\npassage indeed. I am very sorry you have not been able to make out the\r\ncypher of my letter of September the 25th, because it contained things\r\nwhich I wished you to know at that time. They have lost now a part of\r\ntheir merit; but still, I wish you could decipher them, as there remains\r\na part, which it might yet be agreeable to you to understand. I have\r\nexamined the cypher from which it was written. It is precisely a copy of\r\nthose given to Messrs. Barclay and Lambe. In order that you may examine\r\nwhether yours corresponds, I will now translate into cypher the three\r\nfirst lines of my letter of June the 14th.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis will serve to show whether your cypher corresponds with mine, as well\r\nas my manner of using it. But I shall not use it in future, till I know\r\nfrom you the result of your re-examination of it. I have the honor now, to\r\nreturn you the letter you had been so good as to enclose to me. About the\r\nsame time of Liston's conversation with you, similar ones were held with\r\nme by Mr. Eden. He particularly questioned me on the effect of our treaty\r\nwith France, in the case of a war, and what might be our dispositions.\r\nI told him without hesitation, that our treaty obliged us to receive\r\nthe armed vessels of France, with their prizes, into our ports, and to\r\nrefuse the admission of prizes made on her by her enemies; that there\r\nwas a clause by which we guaranteed to France her American possessions,\r\nand which might, perhaps, force us into the war, if these were attacked.\r\n\"Then it will be war,\" said he, \"for they will assuredly be attacked.\" I\r\nadded, that our dispositions would be to be neutral, and that I thought\r\nit the interest of both those powers that we should be so, because it\r\nwould relieve both from all anxiety as to the feeding their West India\r\nislands, and England would, moreover, avoid a heavy land war on our\r\ncontinent, which would cripple all her proceedings elsewhere. He expected\r\nthese sentiments from me personally, and he knew them to be analogous to\r\nthose of our country. We had often before had occasions of knowing each\r\nother: his peculiar bitterness towards us had sufficiently appeared,\r\nand I had never concealed from him, that I considered the British as our\r\nnatural enemies, and as the only nation on earth who wished us ill from\r\nthe bottom of their souls. And I am satisfied, that were our continent\r\nto be swallowed up by the ocean, Great Britain would be in a bonfire from\r\none end to the other. Mr. Adams, as you know, has asked his recall. This\r\nhas been granted, and Colonel Smith is to return too; Congress having\r\ndetermined to put an end to their commission at that court. I suspect and\r\nhope they will make no new appointment.\r\n\r\nOur new constitution is powerfully attacked in the American newspapers.\r\nThe objections are, that its effect would be to form the thirteen States\r\ninto one; that, proposing to melt all down into one general government,\r\nthey have fenced the people by no declaration of rights; they have not\r\nrenounced the power of keeping a standing army; they have not secured\r\nthe liberty of the press; they have reserved the power of abolishing\r\ntrials by jury in civil cases; they have proposed that the laws of the\r\nfederal legislatures, shall be paramount to the laws and constitutions\r\nof the States; they have abandoned rotation in office; and particularly,\r\ntheir President may be re-elected from four years to four years, for\r\nlife, so as to render him a King for life, like a King of Poland; and\r\nthey have not given him either the check or aid of a council. To these\r\nthey add calculations of expense, &c., &c., to frighten the people. You\r\nwill perceive that these objections are serious, and some of them not\r\nwithout foundation. The constitution, however, has been received with\r\na very general enthusiasm, and as far as can be judged from external\r\ndemonstrations, the bulk of the people are eager to adopt it. In the\r\neastern States, the printers will print nothing against it, unless the\r\nwriter subscribes his name. Massachusetts and Connecticut have called\r\nconventions in January, to consider of it. In New York, there is a\r\ndivision. The Governor (Clinton) is known to be hostile to it. Jersey,\r\nit is thought, will certainly accept it. Pennsylvania is divided; and\r\nall the bitterness of her factions has been kindled anew on it. But the\r\nparty in favor of it is strongest, both in and out of the legislature.\r\nThis is the party anciently of Morris, Wilson, &c. Delaware will do\r\nwhat Pennsylvania shall do. Maryland is thought favorable to it; yet it\r\nis supposed Chase and Paca will oppose it. As to Virginia, two of her\r\nDelegates, in the first place, refused to sign it. These were Randolph,\r\nthe Governor, and George Mason. Besides these, Henry, Harrison, Nelson,\r\nand the Lees, are against it. General Washington will be for it, but it\r\nis not in his character to exert himself much in the case. Madison will be\r\nits main pillar; but though an immensely powerful one, it is questionable\r\nwhether he can bear the weight of such a host. So that the presumption\r\nis, that Virginia will reject it. We know nothing of the dispositions\r\nof the States south of this. Should it fall through, as is possible,\r\nnotwithstanding the enthusiasm with which it was received in the first\r\nmoment, it is probable that Congress will propose, that the objections\r\nwhich the people shall make to it being once known, another convention\r\nshall be assembled, to adopt the improvements generally acceptable, and\r\nomit those found disagreeable. In this way, union may be produced under a\r\nhappy constitution, and one which shall not be too energetic, as are the\r\nconstitutions of Europe. I give you these details, because, possibly, you\r\nmay not have received them all. The sale of our western lands is immensely\r\nsuccessful. Five millions of acres have been sold at private sale, for\r\na dollar an acre, in certificates, and at the public sales, some of them\r\nhad sold as high as two dollars and forty cents the acre. The sales had\r\nnot been begun two months. By these means, taxes, &c., our domestic debt,\r\noriginally twenty-eight millions of dollars, was reduced, by the 1st day\r\nof last October, to twelve millions, and they were then in treaty for two\r\nmillions of acres more, at a dollar, private sale. Our domestic debt will\r\nthus be soon paid off, and that done, the sales will go on for money,\r\nat a cheaper rate, no doubt, for the payment of our foreign debt. The\r\n_petite guerre_ always waged by the Indians, seems not to abate the ardor\r\nof purchase or emigration. Kentucky is now counted at sixty thousand.\r\nFrankland is also growing fast.\r\n\r\nI have been told, that the cutting through the Isthmus of Panama, which\r\nthe world has so often wished, and supposed practicable, has at times been\r\nthought of by the government of Spain, and that they once proceeded so\r\nfar, as to have a survey and examination made of the ground; but that the\r\nresult was, either impracticability or too great difficulty. Probably the\r\nCount de Campomanes, or Don Ulloa, can give you information on this head.\r\nI should be exceedingly pleased to get as minute details as possible on\r\nit, and even copies of the survey, report, &c., if they could be obtained\r\nat a moderate expense. I take the liberty of asking your assistance in\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with very great respect and esteem, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, December 12, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--In the month of July, I received from Fiseaux & Co. of\r\nAmsterdam, a letter notifying me that the principal of their loan to\r\nthe United States would become due the first day of January. I answered\r\nthem, that I had neither powers nor information on the subject, but\r\nwould transmit their letter to the board of treasury. I did so, by the\r\npacket which sailed from Havre, August the 10th. The earliest answer\r\npossible, would have been by the packet which arrived at Havre three\r\nor four days ago. But by her I do not receive the scrip of a pen from\r\nanybody. This makes me suppose, that my letters are committed to Paul\r\nJones, who was to sail a week after the departure of the packet; and\r\nthat possibly, he may be the bearer of orders from the treasury, to repay\r\nFiseaux's loan with the money you borrowed. But it is also possible, he\r\nmay bring no order on the subject. The slowness with which measures are\r\nadopted on our side the water, does not permit us to count on punctual\r\nanswers; but, on the contrary, renders it necessary for us to suppose,\r\nin the present case, that no orders will arrive in time, and to consider\r\nwhether anything, and what, should be done? As it may be found expedient\r\nto transfer all our foreign debts to Holland, by borrowing there, and\r\nas it may always be prudent to preserve a good credit in that country,\r\nbecause we may be forced into wars, whether we will or not, I should\r\nsuppose it very imprudent to suffer our credit to be annihilated, for so\r\nsmall a sum as fifty-one thousand guilders. The injury will be greater,\r\ntoo, in proportion to the smallness of the sum; for they will ask, \"How\r\ncan a people be trusted for large sums, who break their faith for such\r\nsmall ones?\" You know best what effect it will have on the minds of\r\nthe money lenders of that country, should we fail in this payment. You\r\nknow best, also, whether it is practicable and prudent for us, to have\r\nthis debt paid without orders. I refer the matter, therefore, wholly to\r\nyour consideration, willing to participate with you in any risk and any\r\nresponsibility which may arise. I think it one of those cases, where\r\nit is a duty to risk one's self. You will perceive, by the enclosed,\r\nthe necessity of an immediate answer, and that, if you think anything\r\ncan and should be done, all the necessary authorities from you should\r\naccompany your letter. In the meantime, should I receive any orders from\r\nthe treasury by Paul Jones, I will pursue them, and consider whatever you\r\nshall have proposed or done, as _non avenue_.\r\n\r\nI am, with much affection, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, December 20, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My last to you was of October the 8th, by the Count de\r\nMoustier. Yours of July the 18th, September the 6th and October the 24th,\r\nwere successively received, yesterday, the day before, and three or four\r\ndays before that. I have only had time to read the letters; the printed\r\npapers communicated with them, however interesting, being obliged to lie\r\nover till I finish my despatches for the packet, which despatches must\r\ngo from hence the day after to-morrow. I have much to thank you for;\r\nfirst and most for the cyphered paragraph respecting myself. These little\r\ninformations are very material towards forming my own decisions. I would\r\nbe glad even to know, when any individual member thinks I have gone wrong\r\nin any instance. If I know myself, it would not excite ill blood in me,\r\nwhile it would assist to guide my conduct, perhaps to justify it, and to\r\nkeep me to my duty, alert. I must thank you too, for the information in\r\nThomas Burke's case; though you will have found by a subsequent letter,\r\nthat I have asked of you a further investigation of that matter. It is to\r\ngratify the lady who is at the head of the convent wherein my daughters\r\nare, and who, by her attachment and attention to them, lays me under great\r\nobligations. I shall hope, therefore, still to receive from you the result\r\nof all the further inquiries my second letter had asked. The parcel of\r\nrice which you informed me had miscarried, accompanied my letter to the\r\nDelegates of South Carolina. Mr. Bourgoin was to be the bearer of both,\r\nand both were delivered together into the hands of his relation here,\r\nwho introduced him to me, and who, at a subsequent moment, undertook to\r\nconvey them to Mr. Bourgoin. This person was an engraver, particularly\r\nrecommended to Dr. Franklin and Mr. Hopkinson. Perhaps he may have mislaid\r\nthe little parcel of rice among his baggage. I am much pleased that the\r\nsale of western lands is so successful. I hope they will absorb all the\r\ncertificates of our domestic debt speedily, in the first place, and that\r\nthen, offered for cash, they will do the same by our foreign ones.\r\n\r\nThe season admitting only of operations in the cabinet, and these being in\r\na great measure secret, I have little to fill a letter. I will therefore\r\nmake up the deficiency, by adding a few words on the constitution proposed\r\nby our convention.\r\n\r\nI like much the general idea of framing a government, which should go on\r\nof itself, peaceably, without needing continual recurrence to the State\r\nlegislatures. I like the organization of the government into legislative,\r\njudiciary and executive. I like the power given the legislature to levy\r\ntaxes, and for that reason solely, I approve of the greater House being\r\nchosen by the people directly. For though I think a House so chosen, will\r\nbe very far inferior to the present Congress, will be very illy qualified\r\nto legislate for the Union, for foreign nations, &c., yet this evil does\r\nnot weigh against the good, of preserving inviolate the fundamental\r\nprinciple, that the people are not to be taxed but by representatives\r\nchosen immediately by themselves. I am captivated by the compromise of the\r\nopposite claims of the great and little States, of the latter to equal,\r\nand the former to proportional influence. I am much pleased too, with the\r\nsubstitution of the method of voting by person, instead of that of voting\r\nby States; and I like the negative given to the Executive, conjointly\r\nwith a third of either House; though I should have liked it better, had\r\nthe judiciary been associated for that purpose, or invested separately\r\nwith a similar power. There are other good things of less moment. I\r\nwill now tell you what I do not like. First, the omission of a bill of\r\nrights, providing clearly, and without the aid of sophism, for freedom\r\nof religion, freedom of the press, protection against standing armies,\r\nrestriction of monopolies, the eternal and unremitting force of the habeas\r\ncorpus laws, and trials by jury in all matters of fact triable by the laws\r\nof the land, and not by the laws of nations. To say, as Mr. Wilson does,\r\nthat a bill of rights was not necessary, because all is reserved in the\r\ncase of the general government which is not given, while in the particular\r\nones, all is given which is not reserved, might do for the audience to\r\nwhich it was addressed; but it is surely a _gratis dictum_, the reverse of\r\nwhich might just as well be said; and it is opposed by strong inferences\r\nfrom the body of the instrument, as well as from the omission of the\r\ncause of our present Confederation, which had made the reservation in\r\nexpress terms. It was hard to conclude, because there has been a want\r\nof uniformity among the States as to the cases triable by jury, because\r\nsome have been so incautious as to dispense with this mode of trial in\r\ncertain cases, therefore, the more prudent States shall be reduced to the\r\nsame level of calamity. It would have been much more just and wise to\r\nhave concluded the other way, that as most of the States had preserved\r\nwith jealousy this sacred palladium of liberty, those who had wandered,\r\nshould be brought back to it; and to have established general right rather\r\nthan general wrong. For I consider all the ill as established, which may\r\nbe established. I have a right to nothing, which another has a right to\r\ntake away; and Congress will have a right to take away trials by jury in\r\nall civil cases. Let me add, that a bill of rights is what the people are\r\nentitled to against every government on earth, general or particular; and\r\nwhat no just government should refuse, or rest on inference.\r\n\r\nThe second feature I dislike, and strongly dislike, is the abandonment,\r\nin every instance, of the principle of rotation in office, and most\r\nparticularly in the case of the President. Reason and experience tell\r\nus, that the first magistrate will always be re-elected if he may be\r\nre-elected. He is then an officer for life. This once observed, it\r\nbecomes of so much consequence to certain nations, to have a friend or\r\na foe at the head of our affairs, that they will interfere with money\r\nand with arms. A Galloman, or an Angloman, will be supported by the\r\nnation he befriends. If once elected, and at a second or third election\r\noutvoted by one or two votes, he will pretend false votes, foul play, hold\r\npossession of the reigns of government, be supported by the States voting\r\nfor him, especially if they be the central ones, lying in a compact body\r\nthemselves, and separating their opponents; and they will be aided by one\r\nnation in Europe, while the majority are aided by another. The election of\r\na President of America, some years hence, will be much more interesting to\r\ncertain nations of Europe, than ever the election of a King of Poland was.\r\nReflect on all the instances in history, ancient and modern, of elective\r\nmonarchies, and say if they do not give foundation for my fears; the Roman\r\nEmperors, the Popes while they were of any importance, the German Emperors\r\ntill they became hereditary in practice, the Kings of Poland, the Deys\r\nof the Ottoman dependencies. It may be said, that if elections are to be\r\nattended with these disorders, the less frequently they are repeated the\r\nbetter. But experience says, that to free them from disorder, they must\r\nbe rendered less interesting by a necessity of change. No foreign power,\r\nnor domestic party, will waste their blood and money to elect a person,\r\nwho must go out at the end of a short period. The power of removing every\r\nfourth year by the vote of the people, is a power which they will not\r\nexercise, and if they were disposed to exercise it, they would not be\r\npermitted. The King of Poland is removable every day by the diet. But\r\nthey never remove him. Nor would Russia, the Emperor, &c., permit them to\r\ndo it. Smaller objections are, the appeals on matters of fact as well as\r\nlaws; and the binding all persons, legislative, executive and judiciary\r\nby oath, to maintain that constitution. I do not pretend to decide, what\r\nwould be the best method of procuring the establishment of the manifold\r\ngood things in this constitution, and of getting rid of the bad. Whether\r\nby adopting it, in hopes of future amendment; or after it shall have been\r\nduly weighed and canvassed by the people, after seeing the parts they\r\ngenerally dislike, and those they generally approve, to say to them, \"We\r\nsee now what you wish. You are willing to give to your federal government\r\nsuch and such powers; but you wish, at the same time, to have such and\r\nsuch fundamental rights secured to you, and certain sources of convulsion\r\ntaken away. Be it so. Send together deputies again. Let them establish\r\nyour fundamental rights by a sacrosanct declaration, and let them pass\r\nthe parts of the constitution you have approved. These will give powers to\r\nyour federal government sufficient for your happiness.\"\r\n\r\nThis is what might be said, and would probable produce a speedy, more\r\nperfect and more permanent form of government. At all events, I hope you\r\nwill not be discouraged from making other trials, if the present one\r\nshould fail. We are never permitted to despair of the commonwealth. I\r\nhave thus told you freely what I like, and what I dislike, merely as a\r\nmatter of curiosity; for I know it is not in my power to offer matter\r\nof information to your judgment, which has been formed after hearing\r\nand weighing everything which the wisdom of man could offer on these\r\nsubjects. I own, I am not a friend to a very energetic government. It is\r\nalways oppressive. It places the governors indeed more at their ease,\r\nat the expense of the people. The late rebellion in Massachusetts has\r\ngiven more alarm, than I think it should have done. Calculate that one\r\nrebellion in thirteen States in the course of eleven years, is but one\r\nfor each State in a century and a half. No country should be so long\r\nwithout one. Nor will any degree of power in the hands of government,\r\nprevent insurrections. In England, where the hand of power is heavier than\r\nwith us, there are seldom half a dozen years without an insurrection.\r\nIn France, where it is still heavier, but less despotic, as Montesquieu\r\nsupposes, than in some other countries, and where there are always two\r\nor three hundred thousand men ready to crush insurrections, there have\r\nbeen three in the course of the three years I have been here, in every\r\none of which greater numbers were engaged than in Massachusetts, and a\r\ngreat deal more blood was spilt. In Turkey, where the sole nod of the\r\ndespot is death, insurrections are the events of every day. Compare\r\nagain the ferocious depredations of their insurgents, with the order, the\r\nmoderation and the almost self-extinguishment of ours. And say, finally,\r\nwhether peace is best preserved by giving energy to the government, or\r\ninformation to the people. This last is the most certain, and the most\r\nlegitimate engine of government. Educate and inform the whole mass of the\r\npeople. Enable them to see that it is their interest to preserve peace and\r\norder, and they will preserve them. And it requires no very high degree\r\nof education to convince them of this. They are the only sure reliance\r\nfor the preservation of our liberty. After all, it is my principle that\r\nthe will of the majority should prevail. If they approve the proposed\r\nconstitution in all its parts, I shall concur in it cheerfully, in hopes\r\nthey will amend it, whenever they shall find it works wrong. This reliance\r\ncannot deceive us, as long as we remain virtuous; and I think we shall\r\nbe so, as long as agriculture is our principal object, which will be the\r\ncase, while there remains vacant lands in any part of America. When we\r\nget piled upon one another in large cities, as in Europe, we shall become\r\ncorrupt as in Europe, and go to eating one another as they do there. I\r\nhave tired you by this time with disquisitions which you have already\r\nheard repeated by others, a thousand and a thousand times; and therefore,\r\nshall only add assurances of the esteem and attachment with which I have\r\nthe honor to be, dear Sir, your affectionate friend and servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. The instability of our laws is really an immense evil. I think it\r\nwould be well to provide in our constitutions, that there shall always\r\nbe a twelvemonth between the engrossing a bill and passing it; that it\r\nshould then be offered to its passage without changing a word; and that if\r\ncircumstances should be thought to require a speedier passage, it should\r\ntake two-thirds of both Houses, instead of a bare majority.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. CARRINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, Dec. 21, 1787.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have just received your two favors of October the 23d and\r\nNovember the 10th. I am much obliged to you for your hints in the Danish\r\nbusiness. They are the only information I have on that subject, except\r\nthe resolution of Congress, and warn me of a rock on which I should most\r\ncertainly have split. The vote plainly points out an agent, only leaving\r\nit to my discretion to substitute another. My judgment concurs with that\r\nof Congress as to his fitness. But I shall inquire for the surest banker\r\nat Copenhagen to receive the money, not because I should have had any\r\ndoubts, but because I am informed others have them. Against the failure of\r\na banker, were such an accident, or any similar one to happen, I cannot\r\nbe held accountable in a case where I act without particular interest.\r\nMy principal idea in proposing the transfer of the French debt, was, to\r\nobtain on the new loans a much longer day for the reimbursement of the\r\nprincipal, hoping that the resources of the United States could have been\r\nequal to the article of interest alone. But I shall endeavor to quiet, as\r\nwell as I can, those interested. A part of them will probably sell out at\r\nany rate; and one great claimant may be expected to make a bitter attack\r\non our honor. I am very much pleased to hear, that our western lands sell\r\nso successfully. I turn to this precious resource, as that which will, in\r\nevery event, liberate us from our domestic debt, and perhaps too, from our\r\nforeign one; and this, much sooner than I had expected. I do not think any\r\nthing could have been done with them in Europe. Individual speculators and\r\nsharpers had duped so many with their unlocated land-warrants, that every\r\noffer would have been suspected.\r\n\r\nAs to the new constitution, I find myself nearly a neutral. There is a\r\ngreat mass of good in it, in a very desirable form; but there is also, to\r\nme, a bitter pill or two. I have written somewhat lengthily to Mr. Madison\r\non this subject, and will take the liberty to refer you to that part of my\r\nletter to him. I will add one question to what I have said there. Would\r\nit not have been better to assign to Congress exclusively the article of\r\nimposts for federal purposes, and to have left direct taxation exclusively\r\nto the States? I should suppose the former fund sufficient for all\r\nprobable events, aided by the land office.\r\n\r\nThe form which the affairs of Europe may assume, is not yet decipherable\r\nby those out of the cabinet. The Emperor gives himself, at present, the\r\nair of a mediator. This is necessary to justify a breach with the Porte.\r\nHe has his eye at the same time on Germany, and particularly on Bavaria,\r\nthe Elector of which has, for a long time, been hanging over the grave.\r\nProbably, France would now consent to the exchange of the Austrian\r\nNetherlands, to be created into a kingdom for the Duke de Deuxports,\r\nagainst the electorate of Bavaria. This will require a war. The Empress\r\nlongs for Turkey, and viewing France as her principal obstacle, would\r\ngladly negotiate her acquiescence. To spur on this, she is coqueting it\r\nwith England. The King of Prussia, too, is playing a double game between\r\nFrance and England. But I suppose the former incapable of forgiving him,\r\nor of ever reposing confidence in him. Perhaps the spring may unfold to\r\nus the final arrangement which will take place among the powers of this\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nI often doubt whether I should trouble Congress or my friends with these\r\ndetails of European politics. I know they do not excite that interest\r\nin America, of which it is impossible for one to divest himself here. I\r\nknow too, that it is a maxim with us, and I think it a wise one, not to\r\nentangle ourselves with the affairs of Europe. Still, I think, we should\r\nknow them. The Turks have practiced the same maxim of not meddling in the\r\ncomplicated wrangles of this continent. But they have unwisely chosen to\r\nbe ignorant of them also, and it is this total ignorance of Europe, its\r\ncombinations and its movements, which exposes them to that annihilation\r\npossibly about taking place. While there are powers in Europe which fear\r\nour views, or have views on us, we should keep an eye on them, their\r\nconnections and oppositions, that in a moment of need, we may avail\r\nourselves of their weakness with respect to others as well as ourselves,\r\nand calculate their designs and movements, on all the circumstances under\r\nwhich they exist. Though I am persuaded, therefore, that these details\r\nare read by many with great indifference, yet I think it my duty to enter\r\ninto them, and to run the risk of giving too much, rather than too little\r\ninformation. I have the honor to be, with perfect esteem and respect, dear\r\nSir, your most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. The resolution of Congress, relative to the prize money received\r\nhere, speaks of that money as paid to me. I hope this matter is properly\r\nunderstood. The treasury board desired me to receive it, and apply it\r\nto such and such federal purposes; and they would pay the dividends of\r\nthe claimants in America. This would save the expense of remittance. I\r\ndeclined, however, receiving the money, and ordered it into the hands of\r\ntheir banker, who paid it away for the purposes to which they had destined\r\nit. I should be sorry, an idea should get abroad, that I had received the\r\nmoney of these poor fellows, and applied it to other purposes. I shall, in\r\nlike manner, order the Danish and Barbary money into the hands of bankers,\r\ncarefully avoiding ever to touch a sou of it, or having any other account\r\nto make out than what the banker will furnish.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. MR. JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, Dec. 21, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The last letters I had the honor of addressing you were of the 3d\r\nand 7th of November. Your several favors, to wit, two of July 27, two of\r\nOct. 24, and one of Nov. 3, have all been delivered within the course\r\nof a week past; and I embrace the earliest occasion of returning to\r\nCongress my sincere thanks for the new proofs I receive therein of their\r\nconfidence in me, and of assuring them of my best endeavors to merit\r\nit. The several matters on which I receive instruction shall all be duly\r\nattended to. The Commissioners of the Treasury inform me they will settle\r\nthe balance appropriated to the Barbary business, apprise me of it, and\r\nplace it under my power. The moment this is done, I will take the measures\r\nnecessary to effect the instructions of Congress. The letter to you from\r\nthe Governor of Rhode Island desires my attention to the application of\r\nthe claimants of the brig Apollonia, which shall surely be complied with.\r\nI trust that an application will be made by the claimants. It will be\r\nthe more important, as the letter in this case, as in that of the sloop\r\nSally, formerly recommended to me, is directed to an advocate whom all my\r\nendeavors have not enabled me to find. I fear, therefore, that the papers\r\nin both cases must remain in my hands till called for by the person whom\r\nthe parties shall employ for the ordinary solicitation and management\r\nof their appeals. I suppose they will engage some person to answer from\r\ntime to time the pecuniary demands of lawyers, clerks, and other officers\r\nof the courts, to wait upon the judges and explain their cases to them,\r\nwhich is the usage here, to instruct their lawyers and confer with them\r\nwhenever necessary, and in general to give all those attentions which the\r\nsolicitation of private causes constantly require here. Their management\r\nindeed is very much a matter of intrigue and of money.\r\n\r\nThe public affairs of Europe are quiet at present, except as between the\r\nTurks and Russians; and, even these, some people suppose may be quieted.\r\nIt is thought that Russia would accommodate easily. The peace between\r\nFrance and England is very generally considered as insecure. It is said\r\nthe latter is not honestly disarming; she is certainly augmenting her land\r\nforces, and the speech of the King, and debates of the court members,\r\nprove their diffidence in the late accommodation. Yet it is believed\r\ntheir premier is a friend to peace, and there can be no doubt of the same\r\ndispositions in the chief minister here. The divisions continue between\r\nthe King and his parliament. A promise has been obtained for convoking the\r\nStates general, as early as 1791, at farthest. The embarrassments in the\r\ndepartment of finance are not yet so cleared up as that the public can see\r\ntheir way through them. The arrival of the Count de La Luzerne, just now\r\nannounced, will probably put their marine operations into new activity.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to enclose you three letters from Mr. Dumas. By one of\r\nthe 23d of October, he proposed to me that Mr. Adams and myself should\r\nauthorize him to go to Brussels on the subject he explains to you. I wrote\r\nhim the answer of Nov. 14th. by which I expected he would see that nothing\r\ncould be done, and think no more of it. His subsequent letters, however,\r\ngiving me reason to apprehend that, making too sure of the expediency of\r\nthe treaty he proposed, he might excite expectations from that government,\r\nI wrote him the letter of Dec. 9 to suggest to him that this proposition\r\nmight not be so certainly eligible as he seemed to expect, and to advise\r\nhim to avoid doing anything which might commit or embarrass Congress. The\r\nuneasiness of his present situation, and the desire of a refuge from it,\r\nhad probably suggested to him this idea, and occasioned him to view it\r\nwith partiality.\r\n\r\nThis will be accompanied with the gazettes of France and Leyden. There\r\nbeing no passenger to go by the packet, within my knowledge, this letter\r\nwill go through the post-office. I shall, therefore, only add assurances\r\nof the esteem and respect with which I have the honor to be, Sir, your\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR LIMOZIN.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, December 22, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have the honor now, to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of\r\nthe 18th and 19th of November, and two of the 18th of the present month. I\r\ndid not write to you immediately on the receipt of the two first, because\r\nthe observations they contained were to be acted on here. I was much\r\nobliged to you for them, as I have been frequently before for others, and\r\nyou will find that I have profited by them in the _Arret_ which is to come\r\nout for the regulation of our commerce, wherein most of the things are\r\nprovided for, which you have from time to time recommended. With respect\r\nto the article of yellow wax, I think there is a general clause in the\r\n_Arret_, which will take it in; but I am not sure of it. If there be\r\nnot, it is now too late to get any alteration made. You shall receive the\r\n_Arret_ the moment it is communicated to me.\r\n\r\nI have examined the case of Captain Thomas, with all the dispositions\r\npossible to interpose for him. But on mature reflection, I find it is\r\none of those cases wherein my solicitation would be ill received. The\r\ngovernment of France, to secure to its subjects the carrying trade between\r\nher colonies and the mother country, have made a law, forbidding any\r\nforeign vessels to undertake to carry between them. Notwithstanding this,\r\nan American vessel has undertaken, and has brought a cargo. For me to\r\nask that this vessel shall be received, would be to ask a repeal of the\r\nlaw, because there is no more reason for receiving her, than there will\r\nbe for receiving the second, third, &c., which shall act against the same\r\nlaw, nor for receiving an American vessel, more than the vessels of any\r\nother nations. Captain Thomas has probably engaged in this business, not\r\nknowing the law; but ignorance of the law is no excuse, in any country.\r\nIf it were, the laws would lose their effect, because it can be always\r\npretended. Were I to make this application to the Comptroller General,\r\nhe might possibly ask me, whether, in a like case, of a French vessel in\r\nAmerica acting through ignorance, against law, we would suspend the law\r\nas to her? I should be obliged honestly to answer, that with us, there is\r\nno power which can suspend the law for a moment; and Captain Thomas knows\r\nthat this answer would be the truth. The Senegal company seems to be as\r\nmuch engaged in it as he is. I should suppose his most probable means of\r\nextrication would be with their assistance, and availing himself of their\r\nprivileges, and the apparent authority he has received from the officers\r\nof government there. I am sorry his case is such a one as I cannot present\r\nto the minister. A jealousy of our taking away their carrying trade, is\r\nthe principal reason which obstructs our admission into their West India\r\nislands. It would not be right for me to strengthen that jealousy.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with much esteem, Sir, your most obedient humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE BOARD OF TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, Dec. 30, 1787.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--In my letter of Aug. 5, I had the honor of enclosing to\r\nyou a letter written me by Messrs. Fiseaux & Co., reminding us that the\r\nprincipal of the loan of 51,000 florins obtained by them, would become\r\ndue on the first day of the ensuing year. A few days ago, I received\r\nanother from them calling for the money. At first I was disposed to\r\nanswer them that I was in nowise authorized to do anything in it, and\r\nthat it rested with you altogether. But, on consulting with some persons\r\nbetter acquainted with the delicacy of credit in Holland, I found there\r\nwas reason to fear that a failure to pay that money might not only do\r\nessential injury to our credit in general, but even hinder the progress of\r\nthe loan going on in the hands of Willincks and Van Staphorsts; and that\r\nit would be for the interest of that loan itself, to pay this demand out\r\nof it, if possible. I wrote, therefore, to Mr. Adams, to consult him about\r\nit, and to know, if he was of the same opinion, whether he would venture\r\nto join me in directing such an application of the money. I wrote at the\r\nsame to Willincks and Van Staphorsts, to know whether they could have as\r\nmuch in their hands to spare, and whether they would venture to pay it on\r\nour order. Mr. Adams approved of the proposition, and was willing to join\r\nin ordering the payment. Willincks and Van Staphorsts answered that they\r\nhad in their hands money enough to pay the February interest of the former\r\nloan, and to answer, for some time yet, Mr. Adams' and my draughts for\r\nour subsistence; but that if they should pay the principal of Fiseaux's\r\nloan, it would be an advance of their own: they likewise observed, that\r\nto pay such a sum without your orders, placed them under an unnecessary\r\nresponsibility. Upon this, I concluded to ask them only to pay this year's\r\ninterest, now becoming due, to desire Fiseaux to receive this, and with it\r\nto endeavor to quiet the creditors till your orders could be received. I\r\nhave this day written to Fiseaux, and to Willincks and Van Staphorsts to\r\nthis purpose, and avail myself of a vessel about to sail from Havre, to\r\ncommunicate the whole transaction to you, and to express my wish that you\r\nwill be pleased to give an answer to Fiseaux. I enclose to you his letters\r\nto me on the subject. From what I can learn, I suspect that if there were\r\na cordial understanding between the Willincks and Van Staphorsts, if the\r\nformer had been as well disposed as the latter, the matter would have\r\nbeen settled with Fiseaux. I have the honor to be, with much respect,\r\nGentlemen, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, December 31, 1787.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Since the receipt of the letter of Monsieur de Calonnes, of October\r\nthe 22d, 1786, I have several times had the honor of mentioning to you,\r\nthat I was endeavoring to get the substance of that letter reduced into\r\nan _Arret_, which, instead of being revocable by a single letter of a\r\nComptroller General, would require an _Arret_ to repeal or alter it, and\r\nof course must be discussed in full Council, and so give time to prevent\r\nit. This has been pressed as much as it could be with prudence. One cause\r\nof delay has been the frequent changes of the Comptroller General; as we\r\nhad always our whole work to begin again with every new one. Monsieur\r\nLambert's continuance in office for some months, has enabled us, at\r\nlength, to get through the business; and I have just received from him\r\na letter, and the _Arret_ duly authenticated; of which I have the honor\r\nto send you a number of printed copies. You will find that the several\r\nalterations and additions are made, which, on my visit to the sea-ports,\r\nI had found to be necessary, and which my letters of June the 21st and\r\nAugust the 6th, particularly mentioned to you. Besides these, we have\r\nobtained some new articles of value, for which openings arose in the\r\ncourse of the negotiation. I say _we_ have done it, because the Marquis\r\nde La Fayette has gone hand in hand with me through this business, and has\r\nbeen a most invaluable aid. I take the liberty of making some observations\r\non the articles of the _Arret_, severally, for their explanation, as well\r\nas for the information of Congress.\r\n\r\nArticle 1. In the course of our conferences with the Comptroller General,\r\nwe had prevailed on him to pass this article with a suppression of\r\nall duty. When he reported the _Arret_, however, to the Council, this\r\nsuppression was objected to, and it was insisted to re-establish the\r\nduties of seven livres and ten sous, and of ten sous the livre, reserved\r\nin the letter of M. de Calonnes. The passage of the _Arret_ was stopped,\r\nand the difficulty communicated to me. I urged everything I could, in\r\nletters and in conferences, to convince them that whale oil was an article\r\nwhich could bear no duty at all. That if the duty fell on the consumer,\r\nhe would choose to buy vegetable oils; if on the fisherman, he could no\r\nlonger live by his calling, remaining in his own country; and that if\r\nhe quitted his own country, the circumstances of vicinity, sameness of\r\nlanguage, laws, religion and manners, and perhaps the ties of kindred,\r\nwould draw him to Nova Scotia, in spite of every encouragement which\r\ncould be given at Dunkirk; and that thus those fishermen would be shifted\r\nout of a scale friendly to France, into one always hostile. Nothing,\r\nhowever, could prevail. It hung on this article alone, for two months,\r\nduring which we risked the total loss of the _Arret_, on the stability in\r\noffice of Monsieur Lambert; for if he had gone out, his successor might\r\nbe less favorable; and if Monsieur Neckar were the successor, we might\r\nlose the whole, as he never set any store by us, or the connection with\r\nus. About ten days ago, it became universally believed that Monsieur\r\nLambert was to go out immediately. I therefore declined further insisting\r\non the total suppression, and desired the _Arret_ might pass, leaving the\r\nduties on whale oil as Monsieur de Calonnes had promised them; but with a\r\nreservation, which may countenance our bringing on this matter again, at a\r\nmore favorable moment.\r\n\r\nArticle 2. The other fish oils are placed in a separate article; because\r\nwhatever encouragements we may hereafter obtain for whale oils, they will\r\nnot be extended to those which their own fisheries produce.\r\n\r\nArticle 3. A company had silently, and by unfair means, obtained a\r\nmonopoly for the making and selling spermaceti candles: as soon as we\r\ndiscovered it, we solicited its suppression, which is effected by this\r\nclause.\r\n\r\nArticle 4. The duty of an eighth per cent. is merely to oblige the masters\r\nof vessels to enter their cargoes, for the information of government;\r\nwithout inducing them to attempt to smuggle.\r\n\r\nArticle 6. Tar, pitch and turpentine of America, coming in competition\r\nwith the same articles produced in the south western parts of France,\r\nwe could obtain no greater reduction, than two and a-half per cent. The\r\nduties before, were from four to six times that amount.\r\n\r\nArticle 10. The right of entrepôt given by this article, is almost the\r\nsame thing, as the making all their ports, free ports for us. The ships\r\nare indeed subject to be visited, and the cargoes must be reported in\r\nports of entrepôt, which need not be done in the free ports. But the\r\ncommunication between the entrepôt and the country, is not interrupted\r\nby continual search of all persons passing into the country, which has\r\nproved so troublesome to the inhabitants of our free ports, as that a\r\nconsiderable proportion of them have wished to give back the privilege of\r\ntheir freedom.\r\n\r\nArticle 13. This article gives us the privileges and advantages of\r\nnative subjects, in all their possessions in Asia, and in the _scales\r\nleading thereto_. This expression means at present the isles of France\r\nand Bourbon, and will include the Cape of Good Hope, should any future\r\nevent put it into the hands of France. It was with a view to this, that\r\nI proposed the expression, because we were then in hourly expectation\r\nof a war, and it was suspected that France would take possession of that\r\nplace. It will, in no case, be considered as including anything westward\r\nof the Cape of Good Hope. I must observe further, on this article, that it\r\nwill only become valuable on the suppression of their East India Company;\r\nbecause, as long as their monopoly continues, even native subjects cannot\r\nenter their Asiatic ports for the purposes of commerce. It is considered,\r\nhowever, as certain, that this Company will be immediately suppressed.\r\n\r\nThe article of tobacco could not be introduced into the _Arret_; because\r\nit was necessary to consider the Farmers General as parties to that\r\narrangement. It rests, therefore, of necessity, on the basis of a letter\r\nonly. You will perceive that this is nothing more than a continuation\r\nof the order of Berni, only leaving the prices unfixed; and like that,\r\nit will require a constant and vexatious attention to have its execution\r\nenforced.\r\n\r\nThe States who have much to carry, and few carriers, will observe,\r\nperhaps, that the benefits of these regulations are somewhat narrowed by\r\nconfining them to articles brought hither in French or American bottoms.\r\nBut they will consider that nothing in these instruments moves from us.\r\nThe advantages they hold out are all given by this country to us, and\r\nthe givers will modify their gifts as they please. I suppose it to be a\r\ndetermined principle of this court not to suffer our carrying business, so\r\nfar as their consumption of our commodities extends, to become a nursery\r\nfor British seamen. Nor would this, perhaps, be advantageous to us,\r\nconsidering the dispositions of the two nations towards us. The preference\r\nwhich our shipping will obtain on this account, may counterpoise the\r\ndiscouragements it experiences from the aggravated dangers of the Barbary\r\nStates. Nor is the idea unpleasing which shows itself in various parts of\r\nthese papers, of naturalizing American bottoms, and American citizens in\r\nFrance and in its foreign possessions. Once established here, and in their\r\neastern settlements, they may revolt less at the proposition to extend it\r\nto those westward. They are not yet, however, at that point; we must be\r\ncontented to go towards it a step at a time, and trust to future events\r\nfor hastening our progress.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the alliance between this and the two imperial courts,\r\nnothing certain transpires. We are enabled to conjecture its progress\r\nonly from facts which now and then show themselves. The following may be\r\nconsidered as indications of it. 1. The Emperor has made an attempt to\r\nsurprise Belgrade. The attempt failed, but will serve to plunge him into\r\nthe war, and to show that he had assumed the character of mediator, only\r\nto enable himself to gain some advantage by surprise. 2. The mediation of\r\nFrance is probably at an end, and their abandonment of the Turks agreed\r\non; because they have secretly ordered their officers to quit the Turkish\r\nservice. This fact is known to but few, and not intended to be known; but\r\nI think it certain. 3. To the offer of mediation lately made by England\r\nand Prussia, the court of Petersburg answered, that having declined the\r\nmediation of a friendly power, (France,) she could not accept that of\r\ntwo courts, with whose dispositions she had reason to be dissatisfied.\r\n4. The States General are said to have instructed their ambassador here,\r\nlately, to ask of M. de Montmorin, whether the inquiry had been made,\r\nwhich they had formerly desired; \"By what authority the French engineers\r\nhad been placed in the service of Holland?\" And that he answered that\r\nthe inquiry had not been made, nor should be made. Though I do not\r\nconsider the channel through which I get this fact, as absolutely sure,\r\nyet it is so respectable that I give credit to it myself. 5. The King\r\nof Prussia is withdrawing his troops from Holland. Should this alliance\r\nshow itself, it would seem that France thus strengthened might dictate\r\nthe re-establishment of the affairs of Holland in her own form. For it is\r\nnot conceivable that Prussia would dare to move, nor that England would\r\nalone undertake such a war, and for such a purpose. She appears, indeed,\r\ntriumphant at present, but the question is who will triumph last?\r\n\r\nI enclose you a letter from Mr. Dumas. I received one from him myself,\r\nwherein he assures me that no difficulties shall be produced, by what he\r\nhad suggested relative to his mission to Brussels. The gazettes of France\r\nand Leyden to this date accompany this letter, which, with the several\r\npapers put under your cover, I shall send to M. Limozin, our agent at\r\nHavre, to be forwarded by the Juno, Captain Jenkins, which sails from that\r\nport for New York, on the 3d of January.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR LAMBERT.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, January 3, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am honored with your Excellency's letter of the 29th of December,\r\nenclosing the _Arret_ on the commerce between France and the United\r\nStates. I availed myself of the occasion of a vessel sailing this day\r\nfrom Havre for New York, to forward it to Congress. They will receive with\r\nsingular satisfaction this new testimony of his Majesty's friendship for\r\nthe United States, of his dispositions to promote their interest, and to\r\nstrengthen the bands which connect the two nations.\r\n\r\nPermit me, Sir, to return you, personally, my sincere thanks for the\r\ngreat attention you have paid to this subject, for the sacrifices you\r\nhave kindly made, of time so precious as yours, every moment of which\r\nis demanded and is occupied by objects interesting to the happiness of\r\nmillions; and to proffer you the homage of those sincere sentiments\r\nof attachment and respect with which I have the honour to be, your\r\nExcellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE QUESNAY.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, January 6, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have never expressed an objection to the part of your plan\r\nrelative to the theatre. The utility of this in America is a great\r\nquestion on which I may be allowed to have an opinion; but it is not for\r\nme to decide on it, nor to object to the proposal of establishing one\r\nat Richmond. The only objection to your plan which I have ever made, is\r\nthat contained in my letter to you. I feared it was too extensive for the\r\npoverty of the country. You remove the objection by observing, it is to\r\nextend to several States. Whether professors itinerant from one State to\r\nanother may succeed, I am unable to say, having never known an experiment\r\nof it. The fear that these professors may be disappointed in their\r\nexpectations, has determined me not to meddle in the business at all.\r\nKnowing how much people going to America overrate the resources of living\r\nthere, I have made a point never to encourage any person to go there, that\r\nI may not partake of the censure which may follow their disappointment.\r\nI beg you, therefore, not to alter your plan in any part of it on my\r\naccount, but permit me to pursue mine of being absolutely neutral.\r\nMonsieur de La Luzerne and the Marquis de La Fayette, know too much of\r\nthe country themselves to need any information from me, or any reference\r\nto my opinion; and the friendly dispositions which they have towards\r\nyou, will insure you their good offices. Convinced of the honesty of your\r\nintentions and of your zeal, I wish you every possible success, and shall\r\nbe really happy to see your plan answer your expectations. You have more\r\ncourage than I have, to take upon yourself the risk of transplanting and\r\ncontenting so many persons. I beg you to be assured of the sincerity of\r\nthe esteem with which I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DRAYTON.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, January 13, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--By Captain Shewell, who is sailing about this time from Marseilles\r\nto Charleston, I directed to be forwarded to you one of two couffes of\r\nrough rice, which I had brought from Egypt. The other came on to me here,\r\nand will be carried from Havre to New York, addressed to you, to the care\r\nof the Delegates of South Carolina in Congress. I wish both may arrive\r\nin time for the approaching seed time, and that the trials with this and\r\nthe Piedmont rice may furnish new advantages to your agriculture. I have\r\nconsiderable hopes of receiving some dry rice from Cochin-China, the young\r\nPrince of that country, lately gone from hence, having undertaken that\r\nit shall come to me. But it will be some time first. These are all but\r\nexperiments; the precept, however, is wise which directs us to try all\r\nthings, and hold fast that which is good.\r\n\r\nYour letter of May the 22d, 1787, informs me that mine of May the 6th,\r\n1786, had never got to hand. I now have the honor to enclose you a copy\r\nof it, of no other consequence than to show you that I was incapable of\r\nso insensible an inattention as the miscarriage of that letter exposed me\r\nto the charge of in your mind. I shall take opportunities of forwarding\r\nto you more of the seed of the Spanish Saintfoine, some of which I have\r\nreceived directly from Malta. I have the honor to be, with sentiments of\r\nthe most perfect esteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LE COMTE BERNSTORFF, MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, COPENHAGEN.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, January 21, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am instructed by the United States of America, in Congress\r\nassembled, to bring again under the consideration of his Majesty, the King\r\nof Denmark, and of his ministers, the case of the three prizes taken from\r\nthe English during the late war, by an American squadron under the command\r\nof Commodore Paul Jones, put into Bergen in distress, there rescued from\r\nour possession by orders from the court of Denmark, and delivered back to\r\nthe English. Dr. Franklin, then Minister Plenipotentiary from the United\r\nStates at the court of Versailles, had the honor of making applications\r\nto the court of Denmark, for a just indemnification to the persons\r\ninterested, and particularly by a letter of the 22d of December, 1779,\r\na copy of which I have now the honor of enclosing to your Excellency.\r\nIn consequence of this, a sum of ten thousand pounds was proposed to\r\nhim, as an indemnification, through the Baron de Waltersdorff, then at\r\nParis. The departure of both those gentlemen from this place, soon after,\r\noccasioned an intermission in the correspondence on this subject. But\r\nthe United States continue to be very sensibly affected by this delivery\r\nof their prizes to Great Britain, and the more so, as no part of their\r\nconduct had forfeited their claim to those rights of hospitality which\r\ncivilized nations extend to each other. Not only a sense of justice due\r\nto the individuals interested in those prizes, but also an earnest desire\r\nthat no subject of discontent may check the cultivation and progress\r\nof that friendship which they wish may subsist and increase between the\r\ntwo countries, prompt them to remind his Majesty of the transaction in\r\nquestion; and they flatter themselves that his Majesty will concur with\r\nthem in thinking, that as restitution of the prizes is not practicable, it\r\nis reasonable and just that he should render, and that they should accept,\r\na compensation equivalent to the value of them. And the same principles\r\nof justice towards the parties, and of amity to the United States,\r\nwhich influenced the breast of his Majesty to make, through the Baron de\r\nWaltersdorff, the proposition of a particular sum, will surely lead him\r\nto restore their full value, if that were greater, as is believed, than\r\nthe sum proposed. In order to obtain, therefore, a final arrangement of\r\nthis demand, Congress have authorized me to depute a special agent to\r\nCopenhagen, to attend the pleasure of his Majesty. No agent could be so\r\nadequate to this business, as the Commodore Paul Jones, who commanded\r\nthe squadron which took the prizes. He will, therefore, have the honor\r\nof delivering this letter to your Excellency, in person; of giving such\r\ninformation as may be material, relative to the whole transaction; of\r\nentering into conferences for its final adjustment, and, being himself\r\nprincipally interested, not only in his own right, but as the natural\r\npatron of those who fought under him, whatever shall be satisfactory to\r\nhim, will have a great right to that ultimate approbation, which Congress\r\nhave been pleased to confide to me.\r\n\r\nI beg your Excellency to accept the homage of that respect which your\r\nexalted station, talents, and merit impress, as well as those sentiments\r\nof esteem and regard with which I have the honor to be, your Excellency's\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM RUTLEDGE.\r\n\r\n                                                       PARIS, Feb. 2. 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I should sooner have answered your favor of Jan. the 2d, but\r\nthat we have expected for some time to see you here. I beg you not to\r\nthink of the trifle I furnished you with, nor to propose to return it,\r\ntill you shall have that sum more than you know what to do with. And on\r\nevery other occasion of difficulty, I hope you will make use of me freely.\r\nI presume you will now remain at London, to see the trial of Hastings.\r\nWithout suffering yourself to be imposed on by the pomp in which it will\r\nbe enveloped, I would recommend to you to consider and decide for yourself\r\nthese questions. If his offence is to be decided by the law of the land,\r\nwhy is he not tried in that court in which his fellow-citizens are tried,\r\nthat is, the King's bench? If he is cited before another court, that he\r\nmay be judged, not according to the law of the land, but by the discretion\r\nof his judges, is he not disfranchised of his most precious right, the\r\nbenefit of the laws of his country, in common with his fellow-citizens?\r\nI think you will find, in investigating this subject, that every solid\r\nargument is against the extraordinary court, and that every one in its\r\nfavor is specious only. It is a transfer from a judicature of learning\r\nand integrity, to one, the greatness of which is both illiterate and\r\nunprincipled. Yet such is the force of prejudice with some, and of the\r\nwant of reflection in others, that many of our constitutions have copied\r\nthis absurdity, without suspecting it to be one. I am glad to hear that\r\nour new constitution is pretty sure of being accepted by States enough\r\nto secure the good it contains, and to meet with such opposition in\r\nsome others, as to give us hopes it will be accommodated to them, by\r\nthe amendment of its most glaring faults, particularly the want of a\r\ndeclaration of rights.\r\n\r\nThe long expected edict of the protestants, at length appears here.\r\nIts analysis is this. It is an acknowledgment (hitherto withheld by the\r\nlaws) that protestants can beget children, and that they can die, and\r\nbe offensive unless buried. It does not give them permission to think,\r\nto speak, or to worship. It enumerates the humiliations to which they\r\nshall remain subject, and the burthens to which they shall continue to\r\nbe unjustly exposed. What are we to think of the condition of the human\r\nmind in a country, where such a wretched thing as this has thrown the\r\nState into convulsions, and how must we bless our own situation in a\r\ncountry, the most illiterate peasant of which is a Solon, compared with\r\nthe authors of this law. There is modesty often, which does itself injury;\r\nour countrymen possess this. They do not know their own superiority. You\r\nsee it; you are young, you have time and talents to correct them. Study\r\nthe subject while in Europe, in all the instances which will present\r\nthemselves to you, and profit your countrymen of them, by making them to\r\nknow and value themselves.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear Sir, and be assured of the esteem with which I am your\r\nfriend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY MR. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                       PARIS, Feb. 6, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The Commissioners of the Treasury have given notice to\r\nWillincks and Van Staphorsts, that they shall not be able to remit them\r\none shilling till the New Government gets into action, and that therefore\r\nthe sole resource for the payment of the Dutch interest till that period\r\nis in the progress of the last loan. Willinck and Van Staphorst reply that\r\nthere is not the least probability of raising as much on that loan as will\r\npay the next June interest, and that, if that payment fails one day, it\r\nwill do an injury to our credit, which a very long time will not wipe off.\r\nA Mr. Stanetshi, one of our brokers, who holds $4,340,000 of our domestic\r\ndebt, offers, if we will pay him one year's interest of that debt, he\r\nwill have the whole of the loan immediately filled up, that is to say, he\r\nwill procure the sum of six hundred and twenty-two thousand eight hundred\r\nand forty florins still unsubscribed. His year's interest (deducting\r\nfrom it ten per cent. which he will allow for payment in Europe instead\r\nof America) will require one hundred and eighty thousand florins of this\r\nmoney. Messrs. Willinck and Van Staphorsts say that, by this means, they\r\ncan pay Fiseaux debt, and all the Dutch interest, and our current expenses\r\nhere, till June 1789, by which time the New Government may be in action.\r\nThey have proposed this to the Commissioners of the Treasury. But it\r\nis possible that the delay of letters going and coming, with the time\r\nnecessary between the receiving their answer and procuring the money, may\r\nforce the decision of this proposition on me at the eleventh hour. I wish,\r\ntherefore, to avail myself of your counsel before your departure, on this\r\nproposition. Your knowledge of the subject enables you to give the best\r\nopinion, and your zeal for the public interest, and I trust your friendly\r\ndisposition towards me will prompt you to assist me with your advice on\r\nthis question, to wit, if the answer of the Commissioners does not come in\r\ntime, and there shall appear no other means of raising the June interest,\r\nwill it be worse to fail in that payment, or to accept of about seven\r\nhundred thousand florins, on the condition of letting one hundred and\r\neighty thousand be applied to the payment of a year's interest of a part\r\nof our domestic debt? Do me the friendship to give me an answer to this as\r\nsoon as possible, and be assured of the sentiments of esteem and respect\r\nwith which I have the honor to be, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COMMISSIONERS OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                                       PARIS, Feb. 7, 1788.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--Your favors of November the 10th and 13th, and December\r\nthe 5th, have been duly received. Commodore Jones left this place for\r\nCopenhagen, the 5th instant, to carry into execution the resolution of\r\nCongress of October the 25th. Whatever moneys that court shall be willing\r\nto allow, shall be remitted to your bankers, either in Amsterdam or Paris,\r\nas shall be found most beneficial, allowing previously to be withdrawn\r\nCommodore Jones' proportion, which will be necessary for his subsistence.\r\nI desired him to endeavor to prevail on the Danish minister to have the\r\nmoney paid in Amsterdam or Paris, by their banker in either of those\r\ncities, if they have one.\r\n\r\nM. Ast (secretary to the consulate) is at L'Orient. Whether he comes up\r\nwith the papers, or sends them, they shall be received, sealed up and\r\ntaken care of. I will only ask the favor of you, that I may never be\r\ndesired to break the seals, unless very important cause for it should\r\narise.\r\n\r\nI have just received from Messrs. Willincks and Van Staphorsts, a letter\r\nof January the 31st, in which are these words. \"The official communication\r\nwe have of the actual situation and prospect of the finances of the United\r\nStates, would render such a partial payment as that to Fiseaux' house\r\nof no avail towards the support of the public credit, unless effectual\r\nmeasures shall be adopted, to provide funds for the two hundred and\r\nseventy thousand florins, interest, that will be due the 1st of June\r\nnext; a single day's retard in which would ground a prejudice of long\r\nduration.\" They informed me, at the same time, that they had made to you\r\nthe following communication; that Mr. Stanitski, our principal broker, and\r\nholder of thirteen hundred and forty thousand dollars, of certificates\r\nof our domestic debt, offers to have our loan of a million of guilders\r\n(of which six hundred and twenty-two thousand eight hundred and forty\r\nare still unfilled) immediately made up, on condition that he may retain\r\nthereout, one hundred and eighty thousand guilders, being one year's\r\ninterest on his certificates, allowing a deduction of ten per cent. from\r\nhis said interest, as a compensation for his receiving it in Amsterdam\r\ninstead of America, and not pretending that this shall give him any title\r\nto ask for any payment of future interest in Europe. They observe, that\r\nthis will enable them to face the demands of Dutch interest, till the\r\n1st of June, 1789, pay the principal of Fiseaux' debt, and supply the\r\ncurrent expenses of your legation in Europe. On these points, it is for\r\nyou to decide. I will only take the liberty to observe, that if they shall\r\nreceive your acceptance of the proposition, some day's credit will still\r\nbe to be given for producing the cash, and that this must be produced\r\nfifteen days before it is wanting, because that much previous notice is\r\nalways given to the creditors that their money is ready. It is, therefore,\r\nbut three months from this day, before your answer should be in Amsterdam.\r\nIt might answer a useful purpose also, could I receive a communication of\r\nthat answer, ten days earlier than they. The same stagnation attending\r\nour passage from the old to the new form of government, which stops\r\nthe feeble channel of money hitherto flowing towards our treasury, has\r\nsuspended also what foreign credit we had. So that, at this moment, we may\r\nconsider the progress of our loan as stopped. Though much an enemy to the\r\nsystem of borrowing, yet I feel strongly the necessity of preserving the\r\npower to borrow. Without this, we might be overwhelmed by another nation,\r\nmerely by the force of its credit. However, you can best judge whether\r\nthe payment of a single year's interest on Stanitski's certificates, in\r\nEurope, instead of America, may be more injurious to us than the shock\r\nof our credit in Amsterdam, which may be produced by a failure to pay our\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nI have only to offer any services which I can render in this business,\r\neither here or by going to Holland, at a moment's warning, if that should\r\nbe necessary.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Gentlemen, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR PRICE.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, February 7, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--It is rendering mutual service to men of virtue and\r\nunderstanding to make them acquainted with one another. I need no other\r\napology for presenting to your notice the bearer hereof, Mr. Barlow. I\r\nknow you were among the first who read the Visions of Columbus, while yet\r\nin manuscript; and think the sentiments I heard you express of that poem\r\nwill induce you to be pleased with the acquaintance of their author. He\r\ncomes to pass a few days only at London, merely to know something of it.\r\nAs I have little acquaintance there, I cannot do better for him than to\r\nask you to be so good as to make him known to such persons, as his turn\r\nand his time might render desirable to him.\r\n\r\nI thank you for the volume you were so kind as to send me some time ago.\r\nEverything you write is precious, and this volume is on the most precious\r\nof all our concerns. We may well admit morality to be the child of the\r\nunderstanding rather than of the senses, when we observe that it becomes\r\ndearer to us as the latter weaken, and as the former grows stronger by\r\ntime and experience, till the hour arrives in which all other objects\r\nlose all their value. That that hour may be distant with you, my friend,\r\nand that the intermediate space may be filled with health and happiness,\r\nis the sincere prayer of him who is, with sentiments of great respect and\r\nfriendship, dear Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A. DONALD.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, February 7, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received duly your friendly letter of November the 12th. By\r\nthis time, you will have seen published by Congress the new regulations\r\nobtained from this court, in favor of our commerce. You will observe,\r\nthat the arrangement relative to tobacco is a continuation of the order\r\nof Berni for five years, only leaving the price to be settled between the\r\nbuyer and seller. You will see, too, that all contracts for tobacco are\r\nforbidden, till it arrives in France. Of course, your proposition for a\r\ncontract is precluded. I fear the prices here will be low, especially\r\nif the market be crowded. You should be particularly attentive to the\r\narticle, which requires that the tobacco should come in French or American\r\nbottoms, as this article will, in no instance, be departed from.\r\n\r\nI wish with all my soul, that the nine first conventions may accept the\r\nnew constitution, because this will secure to us the good it contains,\r\nwhich I think great and important. But I equally wish, that the four\r\nlatest conventions, whichever they be, may refuse to accede to it, till\r\na declaration of rights be annexed. This would probably command the offer\r\nof such a declaration, and thus give to the whole fabric, perhaps, as much\r\nperfection as any one of that kind ever had. By a declaration of rights, I\r\nmean one which shall stipulate freedom of religion, freedom of the press,\r\nfreedom of commerce against monopolies, trial by juries in all cases, no\r\nsuspensions of the habeas corpus, no standing armies. These are fetters\r\nagainst doing evil, which no honest government should decline. There\r\nis another strong feature in the new constitution, which I as strongly\r\ndislike. That is, the perpetual re-eligibility of the President. Of this\r\nI expect no amendment at present, because I do not see that anybody has\r\nobjected to it on your side the water. But it will be productive of cruel\r\ndistress to our country, even in your day and mine. The importance to\r\nFrance and England, to have our government in the hands of a friend or\r\na foe, will occasion their interference by money, and even by arms. Our\r\nPresident will be of much more consequence to them than a King of Poland.\r\nWe must take care, however, that neither this, nor any other objection to\r\nthe new form, produces a schism in our Union. That would be an incurable\r\nevil, because near friends falling out, never re-unite cordially; whereas,\r\nall of us going together, we shall be sure to cure the evils of our new\r\nConstitution, before they do great harm. The box of books I had taken\r\nthe liberty to address to you, is but just gone from Havre for New York.\r\nI do not see, at present, any symptoms strongly indicating war. It is\r\ntrue, that the distrust existing between the two courts of Versailles and\r\nLondon, is so great, that they can scarcely do business together. However,\r\nthe difficulty and doubt of obtaining money make both afraid to enter\r\ninto war. The little preparations for war, which we see, are the effect\r\nof distrust, rather than of a design to commence hostilities. And in such\r\na state of mind, you know, small things may produce a rupture; so that\r\nthough peace is rather probable, war is very possible.\r\n\r\nYour letter has kindled all the fond recollections of ancient times;\r\nrecollections much dearer to me than anything I have known since. There\r\nare minds which can be pleased by honors and preferments; but I see\r\nnothing in them but envy and enmity. It is only necessary to possess them,\r\nto know how little they contribute to happiness, or rather how hostile\r\nthey are to it. No attachments soothe the mind so much as those contracted\r\nin early life; nor do I recollect any societies which have given me more\r\npleasure, than those of which you have partaken with me. I had rather\r\nbe shut up in a very modest cottage, with my books, my family and a few\r\nold friends, dining on simple bacon, and letting the world roll on as it\r\nliked, than to occupy the most splendid post, which any human power can\r\ngive. I shall be glad to hear from you often. Give me the small news as\r\nwell as the great. Tell Dr. Currie, that I believe I am indebted to him\r\na letter, but that like the mass of our countrymen, I am not, at this\r\nmoment, able to pay all my debts; the post being to depart in an hour, and\r\nthe last stroke of a pen I am able to send by it, being that which assures\r\nyou of the sentiments of esteem and attachment, with which I am, dear Sir,\r\nyour affectionate friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. WARVILLE.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, February 12, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am very sensible of the honor you propose to me, of becoming a\r\nmember of the society for the abolition of the slave trade. You know that\r\nnobody wishes more ardently to see an abolition, not only of the trade,\r\nbut of the condition of slavery; and certainly, nobody will be more\r\nwilling to encounter every sacrifice for that object. But the influence\r\nand information of the friends to this proposition in France will be far\r\nabove the need of my association. I am here as a public servant, and those\r\nwhom I serve, having never yet been able to give their voice against the\r\npractice, it is decent for me to avoid too public a demonstration of my\r\nwishes to see it abolished. Without serving the cause here, it might\r\nrender me less able to serve it beyond the water. I trust you will be\r\nsensible of the prudence of those motives, therefore, which govern my\r\nconduct on this occasion, and be assured of my wishes for the success of\r\nyour undertaking, and the sentiments of esteem and respect, with which I\r\nhave the honor to be. Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DUMAS.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, Feb. 12, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your favor of the 5th inst. enclosing that for\r\nMr. Jay. The packet was gone, as I presume, but I have another occasion\r\nof forwarding it securely. Your attentions to the Leyden gazette are, in\r\nmy opinion, very useful. The paper is much read and respected. It is the\r\nonly one I know in Europe which merits respect. Your publications in it\r\nwill tend to re-establish that credit which the solidity of our affairs\r\ndeserve. With respect to the sale of lands, we know that two sales of\r\nfive millions and two millions of acres have been made. Another was begun\r\nfor four millions, which, in the course of the negotiation, may have been\r\nreduced to three millions, as you mention. I have not heard that this\r\nsale is absolutely concluded, but there is reason to presume it. Stating\r\nthese sales at two-thirds of a dollar the acre, and allowing for 3 or\r\n400,000 acres sold at public sale, and a very high price, we may say they\r\nhave absorbed seven millions of dollars of the domestic federal debt. The\r\nStates, by taxation and otherwise, have absorbed eleven millions more: so\r\nthat debt stands now at about ten millions of dollars, and will probably\r\nbe all absorbed in the course of the next year. There will remain then\r\nour foreign debt, between ten and twelve millions, including interest.\r\nThe sale of lands will then go on for the payment of this. But, as this\r\npayment must be in cash, not in public effects, the lands must be sold\r\ncheaper. The demand will probably be less brisk. So we may suppose this\r\nwill be longer paying off than the domestic debt. With respect to the new\r\nGovernment, nine or ten States will probably have accepted by the end\r\nof this month. The others may oppose it. Virginia, I think, will be of\r\nthis number. Besides other objections of less moment, she will insist on\r\nannexing a bill of rights to the new Constitution, _i. e._ a bill wherein\r\nthe government shall declare that, 1. Religion shall be free; 2. Printing\r\npresses free; 3. Trials by jury preserved in all cases; 4. No monopolies\r\nin commerce; 5. No standing army. Upon receiving this bill of rights, she\r\nwill probably depart from her other objections; and this bill is so much\r\nto the interest of all the States, that I presume they will offer it, and\r\nthus our constitution be amended, and our Union closed by the end of the\r\npresent year. In this way, there will have been opposition enough to do\r\ngood, and not enough to do harm. I have such reliance on the good sense\r\nof the body of the people, and the honesty of their leaders, that I am\r\nnot afraid of their letting things go wrong to any length in any cause.\r\nWishing your better health, and much happiness, I have the honor to be,\r\nwith sentiments of the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR DE BERTROUS.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, Feb. 21, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am now to acknowledge the receipt of the letter you did me the\r\nhonor to write me on the 21st of January, together with the book on the\r\nculture of the olive tree. This is a precious present to me, and I pray\r\nyou to accept my thanks for it. I am just gratified by letters from\r\nS. Carolina, which inform me that in consequence of the information I\r\nhad given them on the subject of the olive tree, and the probability\r\nof its succeeding with them, several rich individuals propose to begin\r\nits culture there. This will not interfere with the commerce of France,\r\nbecause she imports much more oil than she exports, and because the\r\nconsumption of oil in the United States at present, is so inconsiderable,\r\nthat should their demand be totally withdrawn at the European market, and\r\nsupplied at home, it will produce no sensible effect in Europe. We can\r\nnever produce that article in very great quantity, because it happens that\r\nin our two southernmost States, where only the climate is adapted to the\r\nolive, the soil is so generally rich as to be unfit for that tree, and\r\nproper for other productions of more immediate profit. I am to thank you,\r\nalso, for the raisins of Smyrna, without seed, which I received from you\r\nthrough Mr. Grand. * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR TRONCHIN.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, February 26, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I should with great cheerfulness have done anything I could for the\r\nmanufacturers of Bourges, had anything been in my power. To this I should\r\nhave been induced by justice to them, and a desire to serve whomsoever\r\nyou befriend. This company is part of a great mass of creditors to whom\r\nthe United States contracted debts during the late war. Those States,\r\nlike others, are not able to pay immediately all the debts which the\r\nwar brought on them; but they are proceeding rapidly in that payment,\r\nand will, perhaps, get through it more speedily than any nation ever did\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nYou will have seen in the public papers the progress they are making in\r\nthis matter. They proceed in this by fixed rules, from which it is their\r\nprinciple never to depart in any instance, nor to do on any account for\r\nany one person what they will not be able to do for all others claiming\r\non the same grounds. This company should engage the French Consul,\r\nor some other person on the spot, to be always ready to present their\r\nclaim whenever anything can be received on it, according to the order of\r\npayment established by Congress. I suppose that the interest might have\r\nbeen annually received. With respect to what they call the reduction\r\nof the debt from its nominal sum, it is not a reduction of it, but an\r\nappreciation at its true value. The public effects of the United States,\r\nsuch as their paper bills of credit, loan office bills, &c., were a\r\ncommodity which varied its value from time to time. A scale of their\r\nvalue for every month has been settled according to what they sold for at\r\nmarket, in silver or gold. This value in gold or silver, with an interest\r\nof six per cent. annually till payment, is what the United States pay.\r\nThis they are able to pay; but were they to propose to pay off all their\r\npaper, not according to what it cost the holder, in gold or silver, but\r\naccording to the sum named in it, their whole country, if sold, and all\r\ntheir persons into the bargain, might not suffice. They would, in this\r\ncase, make a bankruptcy where none exists, as an individual would, who\r\nbeing very able to pay the real debts he has contracted, would undertake\r\nto give to every man fifty times as much as he had received from him. The\r\ncompany will receive the market value of the public effects they have on\r\ntheir hands, and six per cent. per annum on that; and I can only repeat\r\nmy advice to them, to appoint some friend on the spot to act for them\r\nwhenever anything can be received. I have the honor to be, with sentiments\r\nof the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                             PARIS, March 2, 1788.--Sunday.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received this day, a letter from Mrs. Adams, of the 26th\r\nultimo, informing me you would set out on the 29th, for the Hague.\r\nOur affairs at Amsterdam press on my mind like a mountain. I have no\r\ninformation to go on, but that of Willincks and Van Staphorsts, and\r\naccording to that, something seems necessary to be done. I am so anxious\r\nto confer with you on this subject, and to see you and them together,\r\nand get some effectual arrangement made in time, that I determine to meet\r\nyou at the Hague. I will set out the moment some repairs are made to my\r\ncarriage; it is promised me at three o'clock to-morrow; but probably they\r\nwill make it night, and that I may not set out till Tuesday morning. In\r\nthat case, I shall be at the Hague on Friday night; in the meantime, you\r\nwill perhaps have made all your bows there. I am sensible how irksome\r\nthis must be to you, in the moment of your departure. But it is a great\r\ninterest of the United States which is at stake, and I am sure you will\r\nsacrifice to that, your feelings and your interest. I hope to shake you\r\nby the hand, within twenty-four hours after you receive this; and in the\r\nmeantime, I am, with much esteem and respect, dear Sir, your affectionate\r\nfriend and humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                 AMSTERDAM, March 13, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Mr. Adams having announced to our bankers here his approaching\r\ndeparture from Europe, and referred them to me for counsel on our affairs\r\nin their hands, they sent me a state of them, and of the difficulties\r\nwhich were pressing at the moment, and impending more seriously for the\r\nmonth of June. They were urging me by almost every post on this subject.\r\nIn this situation, information of Mr. Adams' journey of leave to the Hague\r\nreached me on the day of his arrival there. I was sensible how important\r\nit was to have the benefit of his interference in a department which had\r\nbeen his peculiarly from the beginning, and with all the details of which\r\nhe was as intimately acquainted as I was little so. I set out therefore\r\nin the instant, joined him at the Hague, and he readily concurred with\r\nme in the necessity of our coming here to confer with our bankers on the\r\nmeasures which might be proper and practicable. We are now engaged on\r\nthis subject, and the result, together with a full explanation of the\r\ndifficulties which commanded our attention, shall be the subject of a\r\nletter which I shall do myself the honor of writing you by Mr. Adams,\r\nto be forwarded by Colonel Smith, who will go in the English packet. I\r\navoid further particulars in the present letter, because it is to pass\r\nthrough the different post-offices to Paris. It will be forwarded thence\r\nby Mr. Short, whom I have desired to do himself the honor of writing\r\nto you any occurrences since my departure, which may be worthy of being\r\ncommunicated, by the French packet of this month. I have the honor to be,\r\nwith sentiments of the most perfect respect and esteem, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                 AMSTERDAM, March 16, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In a letter of the 13th instant, which I had the honor of addressing\r\nyou from this place, I mentioned in general terms, the object of my\r\njourney hither, and that I should enter into more particular details,\r\nby the confidential conveyance which would occur through Mr. Adams and\r\nColonel Smith.\r\n\r\nThe board of treasury had, in the month of December, informed me and our\r\nbankers here, that it would be impossible for them to make any remittances\r\nto Europe for the then ensuing year, and that they must, therefore, rely\r\naltogether on the progress of the late loan. But this, in the meantime,\r\nafter being about one-third filled, had ceased to get forward. The\r\nbankers who had been referred to me for advice by Mr. Adams, stated those\r\ncircumstances, and pressed their apprehension for the ensuing month of\r\nJune, when two hundred and seventy thousand florins would be wanting\r\nfor interest. In fine, they urged an offer of the holders of the former\r\nbonds to take all those remaining on hand, provided they might receive\r\nout of them the interest on a part of our domestic debt, of which they\r\nhad also become the holders. This would have been one hundred and eighty\r\nthousand florins. To this proposition I could not presume any authority to\r\nlisten. Thus pressed between the danger of failure on one hand, and this\r\nproposition on the other, I heard of Mr. Adams being gone to the Hague, to\r\ntake leave. His knowledge of the subject was too valuable to be neglected\r\nunder the present difficulty, and it was the last moment in which we could\r\nbe availed of it. I set out immediately, therefore, for the Hague, and\r\nwe came on to this place together, in order to see what could be done.\r\nIt was easier to discover, than to remove, the causes which obstructed\r\nthe progress of the loan. Our affairs here, like those of other nations,\r\nare in the hands of particular bankers. These employ particular, and they\r\nhave their particular circle of money lenders. These money lenders, as I\r\nhave before mentioned, while placing a part of their money in our foreign\r\nloans, had at the same time employed another part in a joint speculation,\r\nto the amount of eight hundred and forty thousand dollars, in our domestic\r\ndebt. A year's interest was becoming due on this, and they wished to\r\navail themselves of our want of money for the foreign interest, to obtain\r\npayment of the domestic. Our first object was to convince our bankers,\r\nthat there was no power on this side the Atlantic which could accede to\r\nthis proposition, or give it any countenance. They at length, therefore,\r\nbut with difficulty, receded from this ground, and agreed to enter into\r\nconferences with the brokers and lenders, and to use every exertion to\r\nclear the loan from the embarrassment in which this speculation had\r\nengaged it. What will be the result of these conferences, is not yet\r\nknown. We have hopes, however, that it is not desperate, because the\r\nbankers consented yesterday to pay off the capital of fifty-one thousand\r\nflorins, which had become due on the first day of January, and which had\r\nnot yet been paid. We have gone still further. The treasury-board gives\r\nno hope of remittances, till the new government can procure them. For\r\nthat government to be adopted, its legislature assembled, its system of\r\ntaxation and collection arranged, the money gathered from the people into\r\nthe treasury, and then remitted to Europe, must extend considerably into\r\nthe year 1790. To secure our credit then, for the present year only, is\r\nbut to put off the evil day to the next. What remains of the last loan,\r\nwhen it shall be filled up, will little more than clear us of present\r\ndemands, as may be seen by the estimate enclosed. We thought it better,\r\ntherefore, to provide at once for the years 1789 and 1790, also; and\r\nthus to place the government at its ease, and her credit in security,\r\nduring that trying interval. The same estimate will show, that another\r\nmillion of florins will be necessary to effect this. We stated this to\r\nour bankers, who concurred in our views, and that to ask the whole sum at\r\nonce, would be better than to make demands from time to time so small,\r\nas that they betray to the money holders the extreme feebleness of our\r\nresources. Mr. Adams, therefore, has executed bonds for another million of\r\nflorins; which, however, are to remain unissued till Congress shall have\r\nratified the measure; so that this transaction is something or nothing,\r\nat their pleasure. We suppose its expediency so apparent, as to leave\r\nlittle doubt of its ratification. In this case, much time will have been\r\nsaved by the execution of the bonds at this moment, and the proposition\r\nwill be presented under a more favorable appearance, according to the\r\nopinion of the bankers. Mr. Adams is under a necessity of setting out\r\nto-morrow morning, but I shall stay two or three days longer, to attend\r\nto and encourage the efforts of the bankers; though it is yet doubtful\r\nwhether they will ensure us a safe passage over the month of June. Not\r\nhaving my letters here to turn to, I am unable to say whether the last I\r\nwrote mentioned the declaration of the Emperor that he should take part\r\nin the war against the Turks. This declaration appeared a little before,\r\nor a little after that letter, I do not recollect which. Some little\r\nhostilities have taken place between them. The court of Versailles seems\r\nto pursue immovably its pacific system, and from every appearance in the\r\ncountry from which I write, we must conclude that its tragedy is wound up.\r\nThe triumph appears complete, and tranquillity perfectly established. The\r\nnumbers who have emigrated are differently estimated, from twenty to forty\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\nA little before I left Paris, I received a piece of intelligence, which\r\nshould be communicated, leaving you to lay what stress on it, it may\r\nseem to deserve. Its authenticity may be surely relied on. At the time of\r\nthe late pacification, Spain had about fifteen ships of the line nearly\r\nready for sea. The convention for disarming did not extend to her, nor\r\ndid she disarm. This gave inquietude to the court of London, and they\r\ndemanded an explanation. One was given, they say, which is perfectly\r\nsatisfactory. The Russian minister at Versailles, getting knowledge of\r\nthis, became suspicious on his part. He recollected that Spain, during\r\nthe late war, had been opposed to the entrance of a Russian fleet into\r\nthe Mediterranean, and concluded if England was not the object of this\r\narmament, Russia might be. It is known that that power means to send\r\na fleet of about twenty-four ships into the Mediterranean this summer.\r\nHe sent to the Count de Montmorin, and expressed his apprehensions. The\r\nCount de Montmorin declared that the object of Spain in that armament, was\r\ntotally different; that he was not sure she would succeed; but that France\r\nand Spain were to be considered as one, and that the former would become\r\nguarantee for the latter; that she would make no opposition to the Russian\r\nfleet. If neither England nor Russia be the object, the question recurs,\r\nwho is it for? You know best if our affairs with Spain are in a situation\r\nto give jealousy to either of us. I think it very possible that the\r\nsatisfaction of the court of London may have been pretended, or premature.\r\nIt is possible, also, that the affairs of Spain in South America, may\r\nrequire them to assume a threatening appearance. I give you the facts,\r\nhowever, and you will judge whether they are objects of attention or of\r\nmere curiosity.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of sincere esteem and respect,\r\nSir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. I enclose herewith an extract of a letter from the Count de\r\nVergennes to the French ambassador at the Hague, which will make a\r\nremarkable chapter in the history of the late revolution here. It is not\r\npublic, nor should be made so by us. Probably those who have been the\r\nvictims of it, will some day publish it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DUMAS.\r\n\r\n                                                 AMSTERDAM, March 29, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have now to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of the 14th,\r\n18th and 23d instant. I would have preferred doing it in person, but the\r\nseason, and the desire of seeing what I have not yet seen, invite me to\r\ntake the route of the Rhine. I shall leave this place to-morrow morning,\r\nand probably not reach Paris till the latter end of April. In the moment\r\nwe were to have conferred on the subject of paying the arrears due to\r\nyou, a letter of the 20th of February from the Board of Treasury was\r\nreceived, forbidding the application of money to any purpose, (except our\r\ncurrent claims,) till the June interest should be actually in hand. Being\r\nby the letter tied up from giving an order in your favor, I return you\r\nthe letter you had written to Mr. Jay, on the supposition that the order\r\nfor your arrears was given. It has been suggested, however, that if you\r\ncould receive bonds of the loan, you could make them answer your purpose,\r\nand the commissioners say this would in nowise interfere with the views\r\nof the treasury board, nor the provision for the June interest. I have,\r\ntherefore, recommended to them in writing, to give you bonds to the amount\r\nof your balance, if you choose to take them, rather than to wait. I wish\r\nthis may answer your purpose. I remember that in the conversation which I\r\nhad the honor of having with you, on the evening I was at the Hague, you\r\nsaid that your enemies had endeavored to have it believed that Congress\r\nwould abandon you, and withdraw your appointments. An enemy generally\r\nsays and believes what he wishes, and your enemies particularly, are not\r\nthose who are most in the councils of Congress, nor the best qualified\r\nto tell what Congress will do. From the evidences you have received of\r\ntheir approbation, and from their well-known steadiness and justice, you\r\nmust be assured of a continuance of their favor, were they to continue\r\nunder the present form. Nor do I see anything in the new government which\r\nthreatens us with less firmness. The Senate, who will make and remove\r\ntheir foreign officers, must, from its constitution, be a wise and steady\r\nbody. Nor would a new government begin its administration by discarding\r\nold servants; servants who have put all to the risk, and when the risk\r\nwas great, to obtain that freedom and security under which themselves will\r\nbe what they shall be. Upon the whole, my dear Sir, tranquillize yourself\r\nand your family upon this subject. All the evidence which exists as yet,\r\nauthorizes you to do this, nor can I foresee any cause of disquiet in\r\nfuture. That none may arise, that yourself and family may enjoy health,\r\nhappiness, and the continued approbation of those by whom you wish most\r\nto be approved, is the sincere wish of him, who has the honor to be, with\r\nsentiments of sincere esteem and attachment, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COMMISSIONERS OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                                 AMSTERDAM, March 29, 1788.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN, * * * * * * * * I cannot close my letter without some\r\nobservations on the transfer of our domestic debt to foreigners. This\r\ncircumstance and the failure to pay off Fiseaux' loan, were the sole\r\ncauses of the stagnation of our late loan. For otherwise, our credit\r\nwould have stood on more hopeful grounds than heretofore. There was a\r\ncondition in the last loan, that the lenders furnished one-third of the\r\nmoney, the remaining two-thirds of the bonds should remain eighteen months\r\nunsold, and at their option to take or not, and that in the meantime\r\nthe same bankers should open no other loan for us. These same lenders\r\nbecame purchasers of our domestic debt, and they were disposed to avail\r\nthemselves of the power they had thus acquired over us as to our foreign\r\ndemands, to make us pay the domestic one. Should the present necessities\r\nhave obliged you to comply with their proposition for the present year, I\r\nshould be of opinion it ought to be the last instance. If the transfer of\r\nthese debts to Europe, meet with any encouragement from us, we can no more\r\nborrow money here, let our necessities be what they will. For who will\r\ngive ninety-six per cent. for the foreign obligations of the same nation,\r\nwhose domestic ones can be bought at the same market for fifty-five per\r\ncent.; the former, too, bearing an interest of only five per cent., while\r\nthe latter yields six. If any discouragements can be honestly thrown on\r\nthis transfer, it would seem advisable, in order to keep the domestic\r\ndebt at home. It would be a very effectual one, if, instead of the title\r\nexisting in our treasury books alone, it was made to exist in loose\r\npapers, as our loan office debts do. The European holder would then be\r\nobliged to risk the title paper of his capital, as well as his interest,\r\nin the hands of his agents in America, whenever the interest was to be\r\ndemanded; whereas, at present, he trusts him with the interest only. This\r\nsingle circumstance would put a total stop to all future sales of domestic\r\ndebt at this market. Whether this, or any other obstruction, can or should\r\nbe thrown in the way of these operations, is not for me to decide; but I\r\nhave thought the subject worthy your consideration.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Gentlemen, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                                 AMSTERDAM, March 29, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have received from you three letters of March the 9th,\r\n14th, and 17th, and written you two of the 10th and 13th. In the last, I\r\nmentioned to you that I should leave this place the 13th, but I have been\r\ndrawn on from day to day by the hope of seeing the business on which I\r\ncame settled, on the basis of positive engagement, and the great object\r\nof the month of June appeared so sure, that we were about proceeding to\r\nimmediate payment of Mr. Grand, the State of Virginia, and all smaller\r\nclaims, when a letter of the 20th February, from the Commissioners of\r\nthe Treasury, arrived, forbidding the application of money to any object\r\nexcept the diplomatic expenses, till the cash for the June interest was\r\nactually in hand. No room was left for the bankers to execute their\r\ndiscretion. The consequence is a delay of all other objects for some\r\nweeks, which probably might have been effected instantly, without danger\r\nto the great one. Indeed, I had obtained a positive engagement on that\r\nground. Be so good as to communicate this much to Mr. Grand.\r\n\r\nA letter from Mr. Van Berkel, at New York, confirms the arrival of the\r\nCount de Moustier there on the 18th of January, and removes all suspense\r\nand anxiety on that subject. You know we received a similar account the\r\nday before I left Paris, which I communicated to M. de Montmorin. It is\r\nwith infinite affliction that I recollect, in the hurry of my departure,\r\nto have omitted to have notified the same to M. Dupont, who had a son\r\nembarked in the same bottom. I am haunted with this recollection, and\r\nwould beg either yourself or Mr. Grand, whichever sees M. Dupont first,\r\nto let him know that it was neither want of attention nor attachment to\r\nhim which occasioned it to escape me, but the confusion which attended the\r\nsetting out on such a journey on so short notice.\r\n\r\nI set out to-morrow for Utrecht, Nimeguen, &c., and shall pursue the\r\ncourse of the Rhine as far as the roads will permit me, not exceeding\r\nStrasburg. Whenever they become impassable, or too difficult, if they do\r\nbecome so, I shall turn off to Paris. So also if anything of importance\r\nshould call for me at Paris sooner, you will be so good as to address to\r\nme at Frankfort and Strasburg. I will call at the post office there, and\r\nbe happy to find news from you relative to yourself, my daughters, and\r\nAmerica. I shall be at Frankfort about the 8th of April, and at Strasburg\r\nabout the 15th. You shall hear from me on the road. * * * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                                        PARIS, May 2, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am honored with your Excellency's letter by the last packet,\r\nand thank you for the information it contains on the communication between\r\nthe Cayahoga and Big Beaver. I have ever considered the opening a canal\r\nbetween those two water courses as the most important work in that line\r\nwhich the State of Virginia could undertake. It will infallibly turn\r\nthrough the Potomac all the commerce of Lake Erie, and the country west\r\nof that, except what may pass down the Mississippi; and it is important\r\nthat it be soon done, lest that commerce should, in the meantime, get\r\nestablished in another channel. Having, in the spring of the last year,\r\ntaken a journey through the southern parts of France, and particularly\r\nexamined the canal of Languedoc, through its whole course, I take the\r\nliberty of sending you the notes I made on the spot, as you may find in\r\nthem something, perhaps, which may be turned to account, some time or\r\nother, in the prosecution of the Potomac canal. Being merely a copy from\r\nmy travelling notes, they are undigested and imperfect, but may still\r\nperhaps give hints capable of improvement in your mind.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of Europe are in such a state still, that it is impossible\r\nto say what form they will take ultimately. France and Prussia, viewing\r\nthe Emperor as their most dangerous and common enemy, had heretofore\r\nseen their common safety as depending on a strict connection with one\r\nanother. This had naturally inclined the Emperor to the scale of England,\r\nand the Empress also, as having views in common with the Emperor, against\r\nthe Turks. But these two powers would, at any time, have gladly quitted\r\nEngland, to coalesce with France, as being the power which they met\r\neverywhere, opposed as a barrier to all their schemes of aggrandisement.\r\nWhen, therefore, the present King of Prussia took the eccentric measure\r\nof bidding defiance to France, by placing his brother in law on the throne\r\nof Holland, the two empires immediately seized the occasion of soliciting\r\nan alliance with France. The motives for this appeared so plausible, that\r\nit was believed the latter would have entered into this alliance, and\r\nthat thus, the whole political system of Europe would have taken a new\r\nform. What has prevented this court from coming into it, we know not.\r\nThe unmeasurable ambition of the Emperor, and his total want of moral\r\nprinciple and honor, are suspected. A great share of Turkey, the recovery\r\nof Silesia, the consolidation of his dominions by the Bavarian exchange,\r\nthe liberties of the Germanic body, all occupy his mind together, and his\r\nhead is not well enough organized, to pursue so much only of all this\r\nas is practicable. Still, it was thought that France might safely have\r\ncoalesced with these powers, because Russia and herself holding close\r\ntogether, as their interests would naturally dictate, the Emperor could\r\nnever stir but with their permission. France seems, however, to have taken\r\nthe worst of all parties, that is, none at all. She folds her arms, lets\r\nthe two empires go to work to cut up Turkey as they can, and holds Prussia\r\naloof, neither as a friend nor foe. This is withdrawing her opposition\r\nfrom the two empires, without the benefit of any condition whatever. In\r\nthe meantime, England has clearly overreached herself. She excited the\r\nwar between the Russians and Turks, in hopes that France, still supporting\r\nthe Turks, would be embarrassed with the two empires. She did not foresee\r\nthe event which has taken place, of France abandoning the Turks, and\r\nthat which may take place, of her union with the two empires. She allied\r\nherself with Holland, but cannot obtain the alliance of Prussia. This\r\nlatter power would be very glad to close again the breach with France,\r\nand, therefore, while there remains an opening for this, holds off from\r\nEngland, whose fleets could not enter into Silesia, to protect that\r\nfrom the Emperor. Thus, you see, that the old system is unhinged, and\r\nno new one hung in its place. Probabilities are rather in favor of a\r\nconnection between the two empires, France and Spain. Several symptoms\r\nshow themselves, of friendly dispositions between Russia and France,\r\nunfriendly ones between Russia and England, and such as are barely short\r\nof hostility between England and France. But into real hostilities, this\r\ncountry would with difficulty be drawn. Her finances are too deranged, her\r\ninternal union too much dissolved, to hazard a war. The nation is pressing\r\non fast to a fixed constitution. Such a revolution in the public opinion\r\nhas taken place, that the crown already feels its powers bounded, and is\r\nobliged, by its measures, to acknowledge limits. A States General will\r\nbe called at some epoch not distant; they will probably establish a civil\r\nlist, and leave the government to temporary provisions of money, so as to\r\nrender frequent assemblies of the national representative necessary. How\r\nthat representative will be organized is yet uncertain. Among a thousand\r\nprojects, the best seems to me, that of dividing them into two Houses, of\r\nCommons and Nobles; the Commons to be chosen by the Provincial Assemblies,\r\nwho are chosen themselves by the people, and the Nobles by the body of\r\nNoblesse, as in Scotland. But there is no reason to conjecture that this\r\nis the particular scheme which will be preferred.\r\n\r\nThe war between the Russians and Turks, has made an opening for our\r\nCommodore Paul Jones. The Empress has invited him into her service.\r\nShe insures to him the rank of rear admiral; will give him a separate\r\ncommand, and, it is understood, that he is never to be commanded. I think\r\nshe means to oppose him to the Captain Pacha, on the Black Sea. He is by\r\nthis time, probably, at St. Petersburg. The circumstances did not permit\r\nhis awaiting the permission of Congress, because the season was close at\r\nhand for opening the campaign. But he has made it a condition, that he\r\nshall be free at all times to return to the orders of Congress, whenever\r\nthey shall please to call for him; and also, that he shall not in any\r\ncase be expected to bear arms against France. I believe Congress had it\r\nin contemplation, to give him the grade of admiral, from the date of his\r\ntaking the Serapis. Such a measure now would greatly gratify him, second\r\nthe efforts of fortune in his favor, and better the opportunities of\r\nimproving him for our service, whenever the moment shall come in which we\r\nmay want him.\r\n\r\nThe danger of our incurring something like a bankruptcy in Holland, which\r\nmight have been long, and even fatally felt in a moment of crisis, induced\r\nme to take advantage of Mr. Adams' journey to take leave at the Hague\r\nto meet him there, get him to go on to Amsterdam, and try to avert the\r\nimpending danger. The moment of paying a great sum of annual interest\r\nwas approaching. There was no money on hand; the board of treasury had\r\nnotified that they could not remit any; and the progress of the loan which\r\nhad been opened there, had absolutely stopped. Our bankers there gave\r\nme notice of all this; and that a single day's failure in the payment\r\nof interest would have the most fatal effect on our credit. I am happy\r\nto inform you we were able to set the loan a going again, and that the\r\nevil is at least postponed. Indeed, I am tolerably satisfied, that if\r\nthe measures we proposed are ratified by Congress, all European calls for\r\nmoney (except the French debt) are secure enough, till the end of the year\r\n1790; by which time, we calculated that the new government might be able\r\nto get money into their treasury. Much conversation with the bankers,\r\nbrokers and money holders, gave me insight into the state of national\r\ncredit there, which I had never before been able satisfactorily to get.\r\nThe English credit is the first, because they never open a loan, without\r\nlaying and appropriating taxes for the payment of the interest, and there\r\nhas never been an instance of their failing one day, in that payment. The\r\nEmperor and Empress have good credit, because they use it little, and have\r\nhitherto been very punctual. This country is among the lowest, in point of\r\ncredit. Ours stands in hope only. They consider us as the surest nation\r\non earth for the repayment of the capital; but as the punctual payment\r\nof interest is of absolute necessity in their arrangements, we cannot\r\nborrow but with difficulty and disadvantage. The monied men, however,\r\nlook towards our new government with a great degree of partiality, and\r\neven anxiety. If they see that set out on the English plan, the first\r\ndegree of credit will be transferred to us. A favorable occasion will\r\narise to our new government of asserting this ground to themselves.\r\nThe transfer of the French debt, public and private, to Amsterdam, is\r\ncertainly desirable. An act of the new government, therefore, for opening\r\na loan in Holland for the purpose, laying taxes at the same time, for\r\npaying annually the interest and a part of the principal, will answer the\r\ntwo valuable purposes, of ascertaining the degree of our credit, and of\r\nremoving those causes of bickering and irritation, which should never be\r\npermitted to subsist with a nation, with which it is so much our interest\r\nto be on cordial terms as with France. A very small portion of this debt,\r\nI mean that part due to the French officers, has done us an injury, of\r\nwhich, those in office in America, cannot have an idea. The interest is\r\nunpaid for the last three years; and these creditors, highly connected,\r\nand at the same time needy, have felt and communicated hard thoughts of\r\nus. Borrowing, as we have done, three hundred thousand florins a year,\r\nto pay our interest in Holland, it would have been worth while to have\r\nadded twenty thousand more to suppress those clamors. I am anxious about\r\neverything which may affect our credit. My wish would be, to possess it in\r\nthe highest degree, but to use it little. Were we without credit, we might\r\nbe crushed by a nation of much inferior resources, but possessing higher\r\ncredit. The present system of war renders it necessary to make exertions\r\nfar beyond the annual resources of the State, and to consume in one year\r\nthe efforts of many. And this system we cannot change. It remains then,\r\nthat we cultivate our credit with the utmost attention.\r\n\r\nI had intended to have written a word to your Excellency on the subject\r\nof the new constitution, but I have already spun out my letter to an\r\nimmoderate length. I will just observe, therefore, that according to my\r\nideas, there is a great deal of good in it. There are two things, however,\r\nwhich I dislike strongly. 1. The want of a declaration of rights. I am\r\nin hopes the opposition of Virginia will remedy this, and produce such\r\na declaration. 2. The perpetual re-eligibility of the President. This, I\r\nfear, will make that an office for life, first, and then hereditary. I was\r\nmuch an enemy to monarchies before I came to Europe. I am ten thousand\r\ntimes more so, since I have seen what they are. There is scarcely an\r\nevil known in these countries, which may not be traced to their king,\r\nas its source, nor a good, which is not derived from the small fibres of\r\nrepublicanism existing among them. I can further say, with safety, there\r\nis not a crowned head in Europe, whose talents or merits would entitle\r\nhim to be elected a vestryman, by the people of any parish in America.\r\nHowever, I shall hope, that before there is danger of this change taking\r\nplace in the office of President, the good sense and free spirit of our\r\ncountrymen, will make the changes necessary to prevent it. Under this\r\nhope, I look forward to the general adoption of the new constitution with\r\nanxiety, as necessary for us under our present circumstances. I have so\r\nmuch trespassed on your patience already, by the length of this letter,\r\nthat I will add nothing further, than those assurances of sincere esteem\r\nand attachment with which I have the honor to be, your Excellency's most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                        PARIS, May 3, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Mine of February the 6th, acknowledged the receipt of yours of\r\nDecember the 9th and 20th; since that, those of February the 19th and 20th\r\nhave come to hand. The present will be delivered to you by Mr. Warville,\r\nwhom you will find truly estimable, and a great enthusiast for liberty.\r\nHis writings will have shown you this.\r\n\r\nFor public news, I must refer you to my letters to Mr. Jay. Those I\r\nwrote to him from Amsterdam will have informed you of my journey thither.\r\nWhile there, I endeavored to get, as well as I could, into the state of\r\nnational credit there; for though I am an enemy to the using our credit\r\nbut under absolute necessity, yet the possessing a good credit I consider\r\nas indispensable, in the present system of carrying on war. The existence\r\nof a nation having no credit is always precarious. The credit of England\r\nis the best. Their paper sells at par on the exchange of Amsterdam the\r\nmoment any of it is offered, and they can command there any sum they\r\nplease. The reason is, that they never borrow, without establishing taxes\r\nfor the payment of the interest, and they never yet failed one day in\r\nthat payment. The Emperor and Empress have good credit enough. They use\r\nit little and have been ever punctual. This country cannot borrow at all\r\nthere; for though they always pay their interest within the year, yet it\r\nis often some months behind. It is difficult to assign to our credit its\r\nexact station in this scale. They consider us as the most certain nation\r\non earth for the principal; but they see that we borrow of themselves\r\nto pay the interest, so that this is only a conversion of their interest\r\ninto principal. Our paper, for this reason, sells for from four to eight\r\nper cent. below par, on the exchange, and our loans are negotiated with\r\nthe Patriots only. But the whole body of money dealers, Patriot and\r\nStadtholderian, look forward to our new government with a great degree\r\nof partiality and interest. They are disposed to have much confidence in\r\nit, and it was the prospect of its establishment, which enabled us to set\r\nthe loan of last year into motion again. They will attend steadfastly to\r\nits first money operations. If these are injudiciously begun, correction,\r\nwhenever they shall be corrected, will come too late. Our borrowings\r\nwill always be difficult and disadvantageous. If they begin well, our\r\ncredit will immediately take the first station. Equal provision for the\r\ninterest, adding to it a certain prospect for the principal, will give us\r\na preference to all nations, the English not excepted. The first act of\r\nthe new government should be some operation, whereby they may assume to\r\nthemselves this station. Their European debts form a proper subject for\r\nthis. Digest the whole, public and private, Dutch, French and Spanish,\r\ninto a table, showing the sum of interest due every year, and the portions\r\nof principal payable the same year. Take the most certain branch of\r\nrevenue, and one which shall suffice to pay the interest, and leave such\r\na surplus as may accomplish all the payments of the capital, at terms\r\nsomewhat short of those at which they will become due. Let the surplusses\r\nof those years in which no reimbursement of principal falls, be applied\r\nto buy up our paper on the exchange of Amsterdam, and thus anticipate\r\nthe demands of principal. In this way, our paper will be kept up at par;\r\nand this alone will enable us to command in four and twenty hours, at any\r\ntime, on the exchange of Amsterdam, as many millions as that capital can\r\nproduce. The same act which makes this provision for the existing debts,\r\nshould go on to open a loan to their whole amount; the produce of that\r\nloan to be applied, as fast as received, to the payment of such parts of\r\nthe existing debts as admit of payment. The rate of interest to be as the\r\ngovernment should privately instruct their agent, because it must depend\r\non the effect these measures would have on the exchange. Probably it\r\ncould be lowered from time to time. Honest and annual publications of the\r\npayments made will inspire confidence, while silence would conceal nothing\r\nfrom those interested to know.\r\n\r\nYou will perceive by the _compte rendu_ which I send you, that this\r\ncountry now calls seriously for its interest at least. The non-payment of\r\nthis, hitherto, has done our credit little injury, because the government\r\nhere, saying nothing about it, the public have supposed they wished to\r\nleave us at our ease as to the payment. It is now seen that they call for\r\nit, and they will publish annually the effect of that call. A failure\r\nhere, therefore, will have the same effect on our credit hereafter, as\r\na failure at Amsterdam. I consider it then, as of a necessity not to be\r\ndispensed with, that these calls be effectually provided for. If it shall\r\nbe seen that the general provision, before hinted at, cannot be in time,\r\nthen it is the present government which should take on itself to borrow in\r\nAmsterdam, what may be necessary. The new government should by no means be\r\nleft by the old, to the necessity of borrowing a stiver, before it can tax\r\nfor its interest. This will be to destroy the credit of the new government\r\nin its birth. And I am of opinion, that if the present Congress will add\r\nto the loan of a million (which Mr. Adams and myself have proposed this\r\nyear) what may be necessary for the French calls to the year 1790, the\r\nmoney can be obtained at the usual disadvantage. Though I have not, at\r\nthis moment, received such authentic information from our bankers as I\r\nmay communicate to Congress, yet I know privately from one of them, (Mr.\r\nJacob Van Staphorst, who is here,) that they had on hand a fortnight ago,\r\nfour hundred thousand florins, and the sale going on well. So that the\r\nJune interest, which had been in so critical a predicament, was already\r\nsecured. If the loan of a million on Mr. Adams' bonds of this year, be\r\nratified by Congress, the applications of the money on hand may go on\r\nimmediately, according to the statement I sent to Mr. Jay. One article in\r\nthis, I must beg you to press on the treasury board; that is, an immediate\r\norder for the payment of the three years' arrearages to the French\r\nofficers. They were about holding a meeting to take desperate measures\r\non this subject, when I was called to Holland. I desired them to be quiet\r\ntill my return, and since my return, I have pressed a further tranquillity\r\ntill July, by which time, I have given them reason to hope I may have an\r\nanswer from the treasury board, to my letters of March. Their ill humor\r\ncan be contained no longer, and as I know no reason why they may not be\r\npaid at that time, I shall have nothing to urge in our defence after that.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYou remember the report, drawn by Governor Randolph, on the navigation\r\nof the Mississippi. When I came to Europe, Mr. Thompson was so kind as to\r\nhave me a copy of it made out. I lent it to Dr. Franklin, and he mislaid\r\nit, so that it could never be found. Could you make interest with him to\r\nhave me another copy made, and send it to me? By Mr. Warville I send your\r\npedometer. To the loop at the bottom of it, you must sew a tape, and at\r\nthe other end of the tape, a small hook, (such as we use under the name of\r\nhooks and eyes) cut a little hole in the bottom of your left watch pocket,\r\npass the hook and tape through it, and down between the breeches and\r\ndrawers, and fix the hook on the edge of your knee band, an inch from the\r\nknee buckle; then hook the instrument itself by its swivel hook, on the\r\nupper edge of the watch pocket. Your tape being well adjusted in length,\r\nyour double steps will be exactly counted by the instrument, the shortest\r\nhand pointing out the thousands, the flat hand the hundreds, and the long\r\nhand the tens and units. Never turn the hands backward; indeed, it is best\r\nnot to set them to any given place, but to note the number they stand at\r\nwhen you begin to walk. The adjusting the tape to its exact length is a\r\ncritical business, and will cost you many trials. But once done, it is\r\ndone for ever. The best way is, to have a small buckle fixed on the middle\r\nof the tape, by which you can take it up, and let it out at pleasure. When\r\nyou choose it should cease to count, unhook it from the top of the watch\r\npocket, and let it fall down to the bottom of the pocket.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am, with sentiments of the most sincere esteem and attachment, dear Sir,\r\nyour affectionate friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                        PARIS, May 4, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I had the honor of addressing you in two letters of the 13th and\r\n16th of March, from Amsterdam, and have since received Mr. Ramson's of\r\nFebruary the 20th. I staid at Amsterdam about ten or twelve days after\r\nthe departure of Mr. Adams, in hopes of seeing the million of the last\r\nyear filled up. This, however, could not be accomplished on the spot. But\r\nthe prospect was so good as to have dissipated all fears; and since my\r\nreturn here, I learn (not officially from our bankers but) through a good\r\nchannel, that they have received near four hundred thousand florins, since\r\nthe date of the statement I sent you, in my letter of March the 16th; and\r\nI presume we need not fear the completion of that loan, which will provide\r\nfor all our purposes of the year 1788, as stated in that paper. I hope,\r\ntherefore, to receive from the treasury orders in conformity thereto, that\r\nI may be able to proceed to the redemption of our captives. A provision\r\nfor the purposes of the years, 1789 and 1790, as stated in the same paper,\r\nwill depend on the ratification by Congress of Mr. Adams' bonds of this\r\nyear, for another million of florins. But there arises a new call from\r\nthis government, for its interest at least. Their silence, hitherto, has\r\nmade it be believed in general, that they consented to the non-payment of\r\nour interest to them, in order to accommodate us. You will perceive in the\r\nseventy-fifth and seventy-sixth pages of the _compte rendu_, which I have\r\nthe honor to send you, that they call for this interest, and will publish\r\nwhether it be paid or not; and by No. 25, page eighty-one, that they count\r\non its regular receipt, for the purposes of the year. These calls, for the\r\nfirst days of January, 1789 and 1790, will amount to about a million and\r\na half of florins more; and if to be raised by loan, it must be for two\r\nmillions, as well to cover the expenses of the loan, as that loans are\r\nnot opened for fractions of millions. This publication seems to render a\r\nprovision for this interest as necessary, as for that of Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nI had taken measures to have it believed at Algiers, that our government\r\nwithdrew its attention from our captives there. This was to prepare their\r\ncaptors for the ransoming them at a reasonable price. I find, however,\r\nthat Captain O'Bryan is apprized that I have received some authority on\r\nthis subject. He writes me a cruel letter, supposing me the obstacle to\r\ntheir redemption. Their own interest requires that I should leave them\r\nto think thus hardly of me. Were the views of government communicated\r\nto them, they could not keep their own secret, and such a price would\r\nbe demanded for them, as Congress, probably, would think ought not to\r\nbe given, lest it should be the cause of involving thousands of others\r\nof their citizens in the same condition. The moment I have money, the\r\nbusiness shall be set in motion.\r\n\r\nBy a letter from Joseph Chiappe, our agent at Mogadore, I am notified\r\nof a declaration of the Emperor of Morocco, that if the States General\r\nof the United Netherlands do not, before the month of May, send him an\r\nambassador, to let him know whether it is war or peace between them, he\r\nwill send one to them with five frigates; and that if their dispositions\r\nbe unfavorable, their frigates shall proceed to America to make prizes\r\non the Dutch, and to sell them there. It seems to depend on the Dutch,\r\ntherefore, whether the Barbary powers shall learn the way to our coasts,\r\nand whether we shall have to decide the question of the legality of\r\nselling in our ports, vessels taken from them. I informed you in a former\r\nletter, of the declaration made by the court of Spain to that of London,\r\nrelative to its naval armament, and also of the declaration of the Count\r\nde Montmorin to the Russian minister here, on the same subject. I have\r\ngood information, that the court of Spain has itself made a similar and\r\nformal declaration to the minister of Russia, at Madrid. So that Russia\r\nis satisfied she is not the object. I doubt whether the English are\r\nequally satisfied as to themselves. The season has hitherto prevented\r\nany remarkable operation between the Turks and the two empires. The war,\r\nhowever, will probably go on, and the season now admits of more important\r\nevents. The Empress has engaged Commodore Paul Jones in her service. He\r\nis to have the rank of rear admiral, with a separate command, and it is\r\nunderstood that he is in no case to be commanded. He will probably be\r\nopposed to the Captain Pacha on the Black Sea. He received this invitation\r\nat Copenhagen, and as the season for commencing the campaign was too\r\nnear to admit time for him to ask and await the permission of Congress,\r\nhe accepted the offer, only stipulating, that he should be always free\r\nto return to the orders of Congress whenever called for, and that he\r\nshould not be expected to bear arms against France. He conceived that\r\nthe experience he should gain, would enable him to be more useful to\r\nthe United States, should they ever have occasion for him. It has been\r\nunderstood, that Congress had had it in contemplation to give him the\r\ngrade of rear admiral, from the date of the action of the Serapis, and it\r\nis supposed, that such a mark of their approbation, would have a favorable\r\ninfluence on his fortune in the north. Copies of the letters which passed\r\nbetween him and the Danish minister are herewith transmitted. I shall\r\nimmediately represent to Count Bernstorff, that the demand for our prizes\r\ncan have no connection with a treaty of commerce; that there is no reason\r\nwhy the claims of our seamen should await so distant and uncertain an\r\nevent; and press the settlement of this claim.\r\n\r\nThis country still pursues its line of peace. The ministry seem now all\r\nunited in it; some from a belief of their inability to carry on a war;\r\nothers from a desire to arrange their internal affairs, and improve\r\ntheir constitution. The differences between the King and parliaments,\r\nthreaten a serious issue. Many symptoms indicate that the government has\r\nin contemplation some act of high-handed authority. An extra number of\r\nprinters have, for several days, been employed, the apartment wherein they\r\nare at work being surrounded by a body of guards, who permit nobody either\r\nto come out or go in. The commanders of the provinces, civil and military,\r\nhave been ordered to be at their stations on a certain day of the ensuing\r\nweek. They are accordingly gone; so that the will of the King is probably\r\nto be announced through the whole kingdom, on the same day. The parliament\r\nof Paris, apprehending that some innovation is to be attempted, which may\r\ntake from them the opportunity of deciding on it after it shall be made\r\nknown, came last night to the resolution, of which I have the honor to\r\nenclose you a manuscript copy. This you will perceive to be, in effect,\r\na declaration of rights. I am obliged to close here the present letter,\r\nlest I should miss the opportunity of conveying it by a passenger who is\r\nto call for it. Should the delay of the packet admit any continuation\r\nof these details, they shall be the subject of another letter, to be\r\nforwarded by post. The gazettes of Leyden and France accompany this.\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. TERRASSON.\r\n\r\n                                                        PARIS, May 7, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have read with attention the papers on the subject of the canal\r\nof the Santee and Cooper rivers, and shall be glad to do anything I can\r\nto promote it. But I confess I have small expectations for the following\r\nreason: General Washington sent me a copy of the Virginia act for opening\r\nthe Potomac. As that canal was to unite the commerce of the whole western\r\ncountry almost, with the eastern, it presented a great view. The General\r\ndetailed the advantages of it, and it had the weight of his name, and\r\nwas known to be under his immediate direction. It was pushed here among\r\nthe monied men to obtain subscriptions, but not a single one could be\r\nobtained. The stockjobbing in this city offered greater advantages than\r\nto buy shares in the canal. I tried whether they would lend money on\r\nthe security of the canal, but they answered they could get as good an\r\ninterest by lending to their own government, with a douceur in the outset,\r\nand would have their money under their own eye, more at their command, and\r\nmore sure as to the payment of interest. However, if you find any opening,\r\nand can point out to me how I may be useful in promoting it, I shall do\r\nit with infinite pleasure. I have the honor to be, with sentiments of the\r\nmost perfect esteem, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DUMAS.\r\n\r\n                                                       PARIS, May 15, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--My first moments after my return having been necessarily occupied\r\nby letters which had come during my absence, and which required immediate\r\nanswers, I have not till now been able to resume my correspondence with\r\nyou, and to inform you of my safe arrival here after a very agreeable tour\r\nthrough Germany. Our news from America comes down to the 14th of March. At\r\nthat time the state of the new constitution was thus: It had been accepted\r\nin Massachusetts by\r\n\r\n                      187 ayes, against 168 noes.\r\n  Connecticut         148  \"      \"      40  \"\r\n  Pennsylvania         46  \"      \"      23  \"\r\n  Delaware             22  \"      \"      00  \"\r\n  New Jersey           39  \"      \"      00  \"\r\n  Georgia              33  \"      \"      00  \"\r\n                      ---               ---\r\n                      475               231\r\n\r\nThe Conventions of the other States were to meet as follows:\r\n\r\n  Maryland                                April 21.\r\n  South Carolina                          May 12.\r\n  Virginia                                May 26.\r\n  New York                                June 17.\r\n  North Carolina                          July --\r\n  New Hampshire                           June --\r\n\r\nRhode Island had not called a Convention.\r\n\r\nI have received a letter from General Washington, wherein he gives it as\r\nhis opinion, that Virginia will accede to it. Mr. Madison inclines to the\r\nsame opinion. In fact, if Maryland and South Carolina should have adopted\r\nit, as there is great reason to believe, the motives will become very\r\ncogent on Virginia for accepting also. She will see that eight States have\r\nalready concurred, that New Hampshire and North Carolina will probably\r\nconcur, that the opposition to be made by Virginia and New York would have\r\nlittle effect, and joined with Rhode Island would even be opprobrious.\r\nSo that probably she will follow the example set by Massachusetts of\r\naccepting the constitution unconditionally, and instructing her delegates\r\nto join with those of Massachusetts in urging future amendment. In this\r\ncase the matter will be fixed by nine States at the close of this month,\r\nor beginning of the next, and we may have the news by the last of June.\r\nIt is very possible that the President and new Congress may be setting\r\nat New York in the month of September. I have no other material news from\r\nAmerica. Here all seems peace without and war within. A great deal of good\r\nis offered to the nation, but some think there is more evil in the form\r\nof the offer. I have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect\r\nesteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE THE BOARD OF TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                                       PARIS, May 16, 1788.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--In a letter of March 29th, which I had the honor of addressing\r\nyou from Amsterdam, I stated to you what had passed till that date\r\nrelative to our money affairs in England, and I enclosed you an estimate\r\nof these, which looks forward to the end of the year 1790. I mentioned to\r\nyou also, that the prospect of filling up the loan of the last million\r\nwas at that moment good, so that I thought you might be at ease as to\r\nthe payment of the June interest. I have now the pleasure to enclose\r\nyou a letter from our bankers of the 8th instant, wherein they inform me\r\nthey have sold bonds enough to pay the June interest and have a surplus\r\nsufficient to replace the moneys lent from the Virginia fund, and by Mr.\r\nGrand. These advances were but momentary accommodations, made under the\r\nmistaken idea that the money was in Amsterdam ready to replace them,\r\nand it was not in idea to inscribe them on the roll of the debts of\r\nthe United States, to take their turn of payment. You will therefore, I\r\nhope, think me justifiable in having them replaced immediately, as there\r\nis money enough now for that purpose, over and above the June interest.\r\nThe balance due to Gateau is for one of the medals I had your orders to\r\nhave made, and has been due upwards of a twelvemonth. Mr. Short's salary\r\nI suppose included under your general order that the diplomatic calls\r\nshall be regularly paid by our bankers. So far then, I shall venture to\r\ndraw immediately, perhaps also for the little balance due to Ast, whose\r\ndistresses call loudly for assistance. He has been obliged to carry his\r\nclothes to the pawnbrokers' to raise money for his subsistence. All the\r\nother articles of the estimate will await your orders, which you will\r\ntherefore be pleased to give as you think proper. The foreign officers\r\nhad proposed a meeting, the object of which was, as I heard, to address\r\nCongress in terms which would have been very disagreeable, and at the same\r\ntime to present a petition to the King, claiming his interposition. This\r\nwould have made a great deal of noise, and produced very disagreeable\r\neffects. This was a few days before I went to Amsterdam. I saw Colonel\r\nGouvion the day before I set out, and desired him to quiet them till my\r\nreturn, explaining to him that one of the objects of my journey would\r\nbe to enable you to pay them. I have since my return, informed them of\r\nthe prospect of payment, and that your orders for that purpose may be\r\nhoped by the month of June. A letter from O'Brian, at Algiers, shows me\r\nthat he has had an intimation of my being authorized to redeem them, and\r\nimputes the delay to me. I have endeavored, on the contrary, to have it\r\nbelieved at Algiers, that the public will not interest itself in their\r\nredemption, having been assured by the General of the religious order who\r\nis to act for us, that if the Dey has the least expectations that the\r\npublic will interfere, he will hold them at such prices as this order\r\nhas never given, and cannot consent to give, because of the precedent,\r\nand that in this case we shall lose the benefit of their agency. Under\r\nthese circumstances it would be cruelty to the captives to let them know\r\nwe are proceeding to their redemption. They could not keep their own\r\nsecret, and the indiscretion of any one of them might forever blast the\r\nprospect of their redemption. For I suppose it to be uncontrovertible that\r\na regard to the safety and liberty of our seamen and citizens in general\r\nforbids us to give such prices for those in captivity as will draw on our\r\nvessels peculiarly the pursuit of those sea-dogs. It is for the good of\r\nthe captives themselves, therefore, that we submit to be thought hardly\r\nof by them; but no time should be lost unnecessarily in proceeding to\r\ntheir redemption; nor shall a moment be lost after I shall be authorized\r\nby your order to receive the money. You perceive that by the extract from\r\nthe letter of the bankers which I have the honor to enclose you, they\r\nexpect to place speedily the rest of the bonds. I think I may venture to\r\nassure you they can do it at any moment if they are pushed. You know the\r\nmisunderstandings which exist between these two houses. These are the\r\ncause of their not always saying as much as they might venture to say\r\nwith truth. There is an error in the estimate I sent you, which must be\r\nexplained. I omitted, when I set out from Paris, to ask Mr. Short for a\r\nstate of the balance due him, and had always been ignorant of it, as the\r\naccount remained between him and Mr. Grand. When making the estimate at\r\nAmsterdam, therefore, I was obliged to conjecture what that balance was,\r\nwhich I did from a very slight and mistaken circumstance as I now find.\r\nThe balance due him, instead of being about 5000_l._, as I had guessed, is\r\n13,146_l._ 6, as you will see by his account now enclosed.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Gentlemen, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE MOUSTIER.\r\n\r\n                                                       PARIS, May 17, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have at length an opportunity of acknowledging the receipt\r\nof your favors of February, and March the 14th, and congratulating you\r\non your resurrection from the dead, among whom you had been confidently\r\nentombed by the newsdealers of Paris. I am sorry that your first\r\nimpressions have been disturbed by matters of etiquette, where surely\r\nthey should least have been expected to occur. These disputes are the most\r\ninsusceptible of determination, because they have no foundation in reason.\r\nArbitrary and senseless in their nature, they are arbitrarily decided by\r\nevery nation for itself. These decisions are meant to prevent disputes,\r\nbut they produce ten where they prevent one. It would have been better,\r\ntherefore, in a new country, to have excluded etiquette altogether; or if\r\nit must be admitted in some form or other, to have made it depend on some\r\ncircumstance founded in nature, such as the age or station of the parties.\r\nHowever, you have got over all this, and, I am in hopes, have been able\r\nto make up a society suited to your own dispositions. Your situation will\r\ndoubtless be improved by the adoption of the new constitution, which\r\nI hope will have taken place before you receive this. I see in this\r\ninstrument, a great deal of good. The consolidation of our government,\r\na just representation, an administration of some permanence, and other\r\nfeatures of great value, will be gained by it. There are, indeed, some\r\nfaults, which revolted me a good deal in the first moment; but we must\r\nbe contented to travel on towards perfection, step by step. We must\r\nbe contented with the ground which this constitution will gain for us,\r\nand hope that a favorable moment will come for correcting what is amiss\r\nin it. I view in the same light, the innovations making here. The new\r\norganization of the judiciary department is undoubtedly for the better.\r\nThe reformation of the criminal code, is an immense step taken towards\r\ngood. The composition of the Plenary court is, indeed, vicious in the\r\nextreme; but the basis of that court may be retained, and its composition\r\nchanged. Make of it a representative of the people, by composing it of\r\nmembers sent from the Provincial Assemblies, and it becomes a valuable\r\nmember of the constitution. But it is said, the court will not consent to\r\ndo this; the court, however, has consented to call the States General, who\r\nwill consider the Plenary court but as a canvas for them to work on. The\r\npublic mind is manifestly advancing on the abusive prerogatives of their\r\ngovernors, and bearing them down. No force in the government can withstand\r\nthis, in the long run. Courtiers had rather give up power than pleasures;\r\nthey will barter, therefore, the usurped prerogatives of the King, for\r\nthe money of the people. This is the agent by which modern nations will\r\nrecover their rights. I sincerely wish that in this country, they may\r\nbe contented with a peaceable and passive opposition. At this moment,\r\nwe are not sure of this, though as yet it is difficult to say what form\r\nthe opposition will take. It is a comfortable circumstance, that their\r\nneighboring enemy is under the administration of a minister disposed to\r\nkeep the peace. Engage in war who will, may my country long continue your\r\npeaceful residence, and merit your good offices with that nation, whose\r\naffections it is their duty and interest to cultivate. Accept these and\r\nall other the good wishes of him, who has the honor to be, with sincere\r\nesteem and respect, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                       PARIS, May 23, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--When I wrote my letter of the 4th instant, I had no reason to doubt\r\nthat a packet would have sailed on the 10th, according to the established\r\norder. The passengers had all, except one, gone down to Havre in this\r\nexpectation. However, none have sailed, and perhaps none will sail,\r\nas I think the suppression of the packets is one of the economies in\r\ncontemplation. An American merchant, concerned in the commerce of the\r\nwhale oil, proposed to government to despatch his ships from Havre and\r\nBoston at stated periods, and to take on board the French courier and\r\nmail, and the proposition has been well enough received. I avail myself of\r\na merchant vessel going from Havre, to write the present.\r\n\r\nIn my letter of the 4th, I stated to you the symptoms which indicated\r\nthat government had some great stroke of authority in contemplation.\r\nThat night, they sent guards to seize Monsieur d'Epremenil and Monsieur\r\nGoisland, two members of parliament, in their houses. They escaped,\r\nand took sanctuary in the Palais (or parliament house). The parliament\r\nassembled itself extraordinarily, summoned the Dukes and Peers specially,\r\nand came to the resolution of the 5th, which they sent to Versailles by\r\ndeputies, determined not to leave the palace till they received an answer.\r\nIn the course of that night, a battalion of guards surrounded the house.\r\nThe two members were taken by the officers from among their fellows,\r\nand sent off to prison, the one to Lyons, the other (d'Epremenil), the\r\nmost obnoxious, to an island in the Mediterranean. The parliament then\r\nseparated. On the 8th, a bed of justice was held at Versailles, wherein\r\nwere enregistered the six ordinances which had been passed in Council,\r\non the 1st of May, and which I now send you. They were in like manner\r\nenregistered in beds of justice, on the same day, in nearly all the\r\nparliaments of the kingdom. By these ordinances, 1. the criminal law is\r\nreformed, by abolishing examination on the _sellette_, which, like our\r\nholding up the hand at the bar, remained a stigma on the party, though\r\ninnocent; by substituting an oath, instead of torture, on the _question\r\nprealable_, which is used after condemnation, to make the prisoner\r\ndiscover his accomplices; (the torture abolished in 1789, was on the\r\n_question preparatoire_, previous to judgment, in order to make the\r\nprisoner accuse himself;) by allowing counsel to the prisoner for his\r\ndefence; obliging the judges to specify in their judgments the offence\r\nfor which he is condemned; and respiting execution a month, except in the\r\ncase of sedition. This reformation is unquestionably good, and within\r\nthe ordinary legislative powers of the crown. That it should remain to\r\nbe made at this day, proves that the monarch is the last person in his\r\nkingdom, who yields to the progress of philanthropy and civilization.\r\n2. The organization of the whole judiciary department is changed, by the\r\ninstitution of subordinate jurisdictions, the taking from the parliaments\r\nthe cognizance of all causes of less value than twenty thousand livres,\r\nreducing their numbers to about a fourth, and suppressing a number of\r\nspecial courts. Even this would be a great improvement, if it did not\r\nimply that the King is the only person in this nation who has any rights\r\nor any power. 3. The right of registering the laws is taken from the\r\nparliaments, and transferred to a Plenary court, created by the King.\r\nThis last is the measure most obnoxious to all persons. Though the members\r\nare to be for life, yet a great proportion of them are from descriptions\r\nof men always candidates for the royal favor in other lines. As yet, the\r\ngeneral consternation has not sufficiently passed over, to say whether\r\nthe matter will end here. I send you some papers, which indicate symptoms\r\nof resistance. These are, the resolution of the Noblesse of Brittany, the\r\ndeclaration of the Advocate General of Provence, which is said to express\r\nthe spirit of that province; and the _Arret_ of the Chatelet, which is the\r\nhustings court of the city of Paris. Their refusal to act under the new\r\ncharacter assigned them, and the suspension of their principal functions,\r\nare very embarrassing. The clamors this will excite, and the disorders\r\nit may admit, will be loud, and near to the royal ear and person. The\r\nparliamentary fragments permitted to remain, have already, some of\r\nthem, refused, and probably all will refuse, to act under that form.\r\nThe Assembly of the clergy, which happens to be sitting, have addressed\r\nthe King to call the States General immediately. Of the Dukes and Peers\r\n(thirty-eight in number), nearly half are either minors or superannuated;\r\ntwo-thirds of the acting part seem disposed to avoid taking a part; the\r\nrest, about eight or nine, have refused, by letters to the King, to act\r\nin the new courts. A proposition excited among the Dukes and Peers, to\r\nassemble and address the King for a modification of the Plenary court,\r\nseems to show that the government would be willing to compromise on that\r\nhead. It has been prevented by the Dukes and Peers in opposition, because\r\nthey suppose that no modification to be made by the government will give\r\nto that body the form they desire, which is that of a representative of\r\nthe nation. They foresee that if the government is forced to this, they\r\nwill call them, as nearly as they can, in the ancient forms; in which\r\ncase, less good will be to be expected from them. But they hope they\r\nmay be got to concur in a declaration of rights, at least, so that the\r\nnation may be acknowledged to have some fundamental rights, not alterable\r\nby their ordinary legislature, and that this may form a ground work for\r\nfuture improvements. These seem to be the views of the most enlightened\r\nand disinterested characters of the opposition. But they may be frustrated\r\nby the nation's making no cry at all, or by a hasty and premature appeal\r\nto arms. There is neither head nor body in the nation to promise a\r\nsuccessful opposition to two hundred thousand regular troops. Some think\r\nthe army could not be depended on by the government; but the breaking\r\nmen to military discipline, is breaking their spirits to principles of\r\npassive obedience. A firm, but quiet opposition will be the most likely\r\nto succeed. Whatever turn this crisis takes, a revolution in their\r\nconstitution seems inevitable, unless foreign war supervene, to suspend\r\nthe present contest. And a foreign war they will avoid, if possible, from\r\nan inability to get money. The loan of one hundred and twenty millions, of\r\nthe present year, is filled up by such subscriptions as may be relied on.\r\nBut that of eighty millions, proposed for the next year, cannot be filled\r\nup in the actual situation of things.\r\n\r\nThe Austrians have been successful in an attack upon Schabatz, intended as\r\na preliminary to that of Belgrade. In that on Dubitza, another town in the\r\nneighborhood of Belgrade, they have been repulsed, and, as is suspected,\r\nwith considerable loss. It is still supposed the Russian fleet will go\r\ninto the Mediterranean, though it will be much retarded by the refusal of\r\nthe English government, to permit its sailors to engage in the voyage.\r\nSweden and Denmark are arming from eight to twelve ships of the line\r\neach. The English and Dutch treaties you will find in the Leyden gazettes\r\nof May the 9th and 13th. That between England and Prussia is supposed to\r\nbe stationary. Monsieur de St. Priest, the ambassador from this court to\r\nthe Hague, has either gone, or is on the point of going. The Emperor of\r\nMorocco has declared war against England. I enclose you his orders in our\r\nfavor on that occasion. England sends a squadron to the Mediterranean for\r\nthe protection of her commerce, and she is reinforcing her possessions\r\nin the two Indies. France is expecting the arrival of an embassy from\r\nTippoo Saib, is sending some regiments to the West Indies, and a fleet of\r\nevolution into the Atlantic. Seven ships of the line and several frigates\r\nsailed from Cadiz on the 22d of April, destined to perform evolutions off\r\nthe western islands, as the Spaniards say, but really to their American\r\npossessions, as is suspected. Thus the several powers are, by little and\r\nlittle, taking the position of war, without an immediate intention of\r\nwaging it. But that the present ill humor will finally end in war, is\r\ndoubted by nobody.\r\n\r\nIn my letter of February the 5th, I had the honor of informing you of\r\nthe discontent produced by our _Arret_ of December the 29th, among the\r\nmerchants of this country, and of the deputations from the chambers of\r\ncommerce to the minister on that subject. The articles attacked were\r\nthe privileges on the sale of our ships, and the entrepôt for codfish.\r\nThe former I knew to be valuable; the latter I supposed not so; because\r\nduring the whole of the time we have had our free ports in this kingdom,\r\nwe have never used them for the smuggling of fish. I concluded, therefore,\r\nthe ports of entrepôt would not be used for that purpose. I saw that\r\nthe ministers would sacrifice something to quiet the merchants, and was\r\nglad to save the valuable article relative to our ships, by abandoning\r\nthe useless one for our codfish. It was settled, therefore, in our\r\nconferences, that an _Arret_ should be passed, abridging the former one\r\nonly as to the entrepôt of codfish. I was in Holland when the _Arret_ came\r\nout; and did not get a copy of it till yesterday. Surprised to find that\r\nfish oil was thereby also excluded from the entrepôt, I have been to-day\r\nto make some inquiry into the cause; and from what I can learn, I conclude\r\nit must have been a mere error in the clerk who formed the _Arret_, and\r\nthat it escaped attention on its passage. The entrepôt of whale oil was\r\nnot objected to by a single deputy at the conferences, and the excluding\r\nit is contrary to the spirit of encouragement the ministers have shown a\r\ndisposition to give. I trust, therefore, I may get it altered on the first\r\noccasion which occurs, and I believe one will soon occur. In the meantime\r\nwe do not store a single drop for re-exportation, as all which comes here\r\nis needed for the consumption of this country: which will alone, according\r\nto appearances, become so considerable as to require all we can produce.\r\n\r\nBy a letter of the 8th instant, from our bankers, I learn that they had\r\ndisposed of bonds enough to pay our June interest, and to replace the\r\ntemporary advances made by Mr. Grand, and from a fund placed here by the\r\nState of Virginia. I have desired them, accordingly, to replace these\r\nmoneys, which had been lent for the moment only, and in confidence of\r\nimmediate repayment. They add that the payment of the June interest and\r\nthe news from America, will, as they trust, enable them to place the\r\nremaining bonds of the last year's million. I suppose, indeed, that there\r\nis no doubt of it, and that none would have been expressed, if those two\r\nhouses could draw better together than they do. In the meantime, I hope\r\nthe treasury board will send an order for so much as may be necessary for\r\nexecuting the purposes of Congress, as to our captives at Algiers.\r\n\r\nI send you herewith a Memoire of Monsieur Caseaux, whose name is familiar\r\non the journals of Congress. He prepared it to be delivered to the King,\r\nbut I believe he will think better, and not deliver it. The gazettes of\r\nFrance and Leyden accompany this. I have the honor to be, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. _May 27, 1788._ I have kept my letter open to the moment of Mr.\r\nWarville's departure, (he being the bearer of it,) that I might add any\r\nnew incidents that should occur. The refusal of the Chatelet and Grande\r\nChambre of Paris to act in the new character assigned them, continues.\r\nMany of the _grandes bailliages_ accept, some conditionally, some fully.\r\nThis will facilitate greatly the measures of government, and may possibly\r\ngive them a favorable issue. The parliament of Thoulouse, considering the\r\nedicts as nullities, went on with their business They have been exiled\r\nin consequence. Monsieur de St. Priest left Paris for the Hague, on the\r\n23d. I mention this fact, because it denotes the acquiescence of this\r\ngovernment in the late revolution there. A second division of a Spanish\r\nfleet will put to sea soon. Its destination not declared. Sweden is arming\r\nto a greater extent than was at first supposed. From twelve to sixteen\r\nsail of the line are spoken of, on good grounds. Denmark, for her own\r\nsecurity, must arm in proportion to this.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN BROWN.\r\n\r\n                                                       PARIS, May 26, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--It was with great pleasure I saw your name on the roll of\r\nDelegates, but I did not know you had actually come on to New York, till\r\nMr. Paradise informed me of it. Your removal from Carolina to Kentucky,\r\nwas not an indifferent event to me. I wish to see that country in the\r\nhands of people well disposed, who know the value of the connection\r\nbetween that and the maritime States, and who wish to cultivate it. I\r\nconsider their happiness as bound up together, and that every measure\r\nshould be taken, which may draw the bands of union tighter. It will be\r\nan efficacious one to receive them into Congress, as I perceive they are\r\nabout to desire. If to this be added an honest and disinterested conduct\r\nin Congress, as to everything relating to them, we may hope for a perfect\r\nharmony. The navigation of the Mississippi was, perhaps, the strongest\r\ntrial to which the justice of the federal government could be put. If ever\r\nthey thought wrong about it, I trust they have got to rights. I should\r\nthink it proper for the western country to defer pushing their right to\r\nthat navigation to extremity, as long as they can do without it tolerably;\r\nbut that the moment it becomes absolutely necessary for them, it will\r\nbecome the duty of the maritime States to push it to every extremity,\r\nto which they would their own right of navigating the Chesapeake, the\r\nDelaware, the Hudson, or any other water. A time of peace will not be the\r\nsurest for obtaining this object. Those, therefore, who have influence\r\nin the new country, would act wisely to endeavor to keep things quiet\r\ntill the western parts of Europe shall be engaged in war. Notwithstanding\r\nthe aversion of the courts of London and Versailles to war, it is not\r\ncertain that some incident may not engage them in it. England, France,\r\nSpain, Russia, Sweden and Denmark will all have fleets at sea, or ready\r\nto put to sea immediately. Who can answer for the prudence of all their\r\nofficers? War is their interest. Even their courts are pacific from\r\nimpotence only, not from disposition. I wish to heaven that our new\r\ngovernment may see the importance of putting themselves immediately into\r\na respectable position. To make provision for the speedy payment of their\r\nforeign debts, will be the first operation necessary. This will give\r\nthem credit. A concomitant one should be magazines and manufactures of\r\narms. This country is at present in a crisis of very uncertain issue.\r\nI am in hopes it will be a favorable one to the rights and happiness of\r\nthe people; and that this will take place quietly. Small changes in the\r\nlate regulations will render them wholly good. The campaign opens between\r\nthe Turks and the two empires, with an aspect rather favorable to the\r\nformer. The Russians seem not yet thawed from the winter's torpitude.\r\nThey have no army yet in motion; and the Emperor has been worsted in\r\ntwo-thirds of the small actions which they have had as yet. He is said\r\nto be rather retiring. I do not think, however, that the success of the\r\nTurks in the partisan affairs which have taken place, can authorize us to\r\npresume that they will be superior also in great decisions. Their want\r\nof discipline and skill in military manœuvres, is of little consequence\r\nin small engagements, and of great in larger ones. Their grand army was\r\nat Adrianople by the last accounts, and to get from thence to Belgrade,\r\nwill require a month. It will be that time at least, then, before we can\r\nhave any very interesting news from them. In the meantime the plague rages\r\nat Constantinople to a terrible degree. I cannot think but that it would\r\nbe desirable to all commercial nations, to have that nation and all its\r\ndependencies driven from the sea-coast into the interior parts of Asia and\r\nAfrica. What a field would thus be restored to commerce! The finest parts\r\nof the old world are now dead, in a great degree, to commerce, to arts,\r\nto science and to society. Greece, Syria, Egypt and the northern coast\r\nof Africa, constituted the whole world almost, for the Romans, and to us\r\nthey are scarcely known, scarcely accessible at all. The present summer\r\nwill enable us to judge what turn this contest will take. I am greatly\r\nanxious to hear that nine States accept our new constitution. We must be\r\ncontented to accept of its good, and to cure what is evil in it hereafter.\r\nIt seems necessary for our happiness at home; I am sure it is so for our\r\nrespectability abroad. I shall, at all times, be glad to hear from you,\r\nfrom New York, from Kentucky, or whatever region of the earth you inhabit;\r\nbeing with sentiments of very sincere esteem and attachment, dear Sir,\r\nyour friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\n                                                       PARIS, May 27, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favors of April the 14th and 29th, and May the 8th, have\r\nlately come to hand. That of January the 29th, by M. de Molinedo, had been\r\nleft here during my absence on a journey to Amsterdam. That gentleman\r\nhad gone, as I presume, before my return, from my being unable to learn\r\nanything of him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Isthmus of Panama, I am assured by Burgoine, (who\r\nwould not choose to be named, however,) that a survey was made, that a\r\ncanal appeared very practicable, and that the idea was suppressed for\r\npolitical reasons altogether. He has seen and minutely examined the\r\nreport. This report is to me a vast desideratum, for reasons political\r\nand philosophical. I cannot help suspecting the Spanish squadron to be\r\ngone to South America, and that some disturbances have been excited there\r\nby the British. The court of Madrid may suppose we would not see this\r\nwith an unwilling eye. This may be true as to the uninformed part of our\r\npeople; but those who look into futurity farther than the present moment\r\nor age, and who combine well what is, with what is to be, must see that\r\nour interests, well understood, and our wishes are, that Spain shall\r\n(not forever, but) very long retain her possessions in that quarter;\r\nand that her views and ours must, in a good degree, and for a long time,\r\nconcur. It is said in our gazettes, that the Spaniards have sunk one of\r\nour boats on the Mississippi, and that our people retaliated on one of\r\ntheirs. But my letters not mentioning this fact, has made me hope it\r\nis not true, in which hope your letter confirms me. There are now one\r\nhundred thousand inhabitants in Kentucky. They have accepted the offer\r\nof independence, on the terms proposed by Virginia, and they have decided\r\nthat their independent government shall begin on the first day of the next\r\nyear. In the meantime, they claim admittance into Congress. Georgia has\r\nceded her western territory to the United States, to take place with the\r\ncommencement of the new federal government. I do not know the boundaries.\r\nThere has been some dispute of etiquette with the new French minister,\r\nwhich has disgusted him.\r\n\r\nThe following is a state of the progress and prospects of the new plan of\r\ngovernment. * * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe conduct of Massachusetts has been noble. She accepted the\r\nconstitution, but voted that it should stand as a perpetual instruction\r\nto her Delegates, to endeavor to obtain such and such reformations; and\r\nthe minority, though very strong both in numbers and abilities, declared\r\n_viritim_ and _seriatim_, that acknowledging the principle that the\r\nmajority must give the law, they would now support the new constitution\r\nwith their tongues, and with their blood, if necessary. I was much pleased\r\nwith many and essential parts of this instrument, from the beginning. But\r\nI thought I saw in it many faults, great and small. What I have read and\r\nreflected has brought me over from several of my objections of the first\r\nmoment, and to acquiesce under some others. Two only remain, of essential\r\nconsideration, to wit, the want of a bill of rights, and the expunging\r\nthe principle of necessary rotation in the offices of President and\r\nSenator. At first, I wished that when nine States should have accepted the\r\nconstitution, so as to insure us what is good in it, the other four might\r\nhold off till the want of the bill of rights, at least, might be supplied.\r\nBut I am now convinced that the plan of Massachusetts is the best, that\r\nis, to accept, and to amend afterwards. If the States which were to decide\r\nafter her, should all do the same, it is impossible but they must obtain\r\nthe essential amendments. It will be more difficult, if we lose this\r\ninstrument, to recover what is good in it, than to correct what is bad,\r\nafter we shall have adopted it. It has, therefore, my hearty prayers, and\r\nI wait with anxiety for news of the votes of Maryland, South Carolina,\r\nand Virginia. There is no doubt that General Washington will accept the\r\npresidentship; though he is silent on the subject. He would not be chosen\r\nto the Virginia convention. A riot has taken place in New York, which I\r\nwill state to you from an eye witness. It has long been a practice with\r\nthe surgeons of that city, to steal from the grave bodies recently buried.\r\nA citizen had lost his wife: he went the first or second evening after her\r\nburial, to pay a visit to her grave. He found that it had been disturbed,\r\nand suspected from what quarter. He found means to be admitted to the\r\nanatomical lecture of that day, and on his entering the room, saw the body\r\nof his wife, naked and under dissection. He raised the people immediately.\r\nThe body, in the meantime, was secreted. They entered into, and searched\r\nthe houses of the physicians whom they most suspected, but found nothing.\r\nOne of them, however, more guilty or more timid than the rest, took asylum\r\nin the prison. The mob considered this an acknowledgment of guilt. They\r\nattacked the prison. The Governor ordered militia to protect the culprit,\r\nand suppress the mob. The militia, thinking the mob had just provocation,\r\nrefused to turn out. Hereupon the people of more reflection, thinking it\r\nmore dangerous that even a guilty person should be punished without the\r\nforms of law, than that he should escape, armed themselves, and went to\r\nprotect the physician. They were received by the mob with a volley of\r\nstones, which wounded several of them. They hereupon fired on the mob, and\r\nkilled four. By this time, they received a reinforcement of other citizens\r\nof the militia horse, the appearance of which, in the critical moment,\r\ndispersed the mob. So ended this chapter of history, which I have detailed\r\nto you, because it may be represented as a political riot, when politics\r\nhad nothing to do with it. Mr. Jay and Baron Steuben were both grievously\r\nwounded in the head by stones. The former still kept his bed, and the\r\nlatter his room, when the packet sailed, which was the 24th of April.\r\nI am, with sentiments of great esteem and respect, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                           (Private.)  PARIS, May 27, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The change which is likely to take place in the form of our\r\ngovernment, seems to render it proper that during the existence of the\r\npresent government, an article should be mentioned which concerns me\r\npersonally. Uncertain, however, how far Congress may have decided to do\r\nbusiness when so near the close of their administration; less capable\r\nthan those on the spot of foreseeing the character of the new government;\r\nand not fully confiding in my own judgment, where it is so liable to be\r\nseduced by feeling, I take the liberty of asking your friendly counsel,\r\nand that of my friend Mr. Madison, and of referring the matter to your\r\njudgments and discretion.\r\n\r\nMr. Barclay, when in Europe, was authorized to settle all the European\r\naccounts of the United States: he settled those of Dr. Franklin and\r\nMr. Adams, and it was intended between us, that he should settle mine.\r\nBut as what may be done at any time is often put off to the last, this\r\nsettlement had been made to give way to others, and that of Beaumarchais\r\nbeing pressed on Mr. Barclay before his departure to Morocco, and having\r\nlong retarded his departure, it was agreed that my affair should await his\r\nreturn from that mission; you know the circumstances which prevented his\r\nreturn to Paris after that mission was finished. My account is therefore\r\nunsettled, but I have no anxiety on any article of it, except one, that\r\nis, the outfit. This consists of 1, clothes; 2, carriage and horses;\r\n3, household furniture. When Congress made their first appointments of\r\nministers to be resident in Europe, I have understood (for I was not\r\nthen in Congress) that they allowed them all their expenses, and a fixed\r\nsum over and above for their time. Among their expenses, was necessarily\r\nunderstood their outfit. Afterwards, they thought proper to give them\r\nfixed salaries of eleven thousand one hundred and eleven dollars and one\r\nninth, a year; and again, by a resolution of May the 6th and 8th, 1784,\r\nthe \"_salaries_\" of their ministers at foreign courts were reduced to\r\nnine thousand dollars, to take place on the 1st of August ensuing. On the\r\n7th of May, I was appointed, in addition to Mr. Adams and Dr. Franklin,\r\nfor the negotiation of treaties of commerce; but this appointment being\r\ntemporary, for two years only, and not as of a resident minister, the\r\narticle of outfit did not come into question. I asked an advance of six\r\nmonths' salary, that I might be in cash to meet the first expenses; which\r\nwas ordered. The year following, I was appointed to succeed Dr. Franklin\r\nat this court. This was the first appointment of a minister resident,\r\nsince the original ones, under which all expenses were to be paid. So\r\nmuch of the ancient regulation, as respected _annual expenses_ had been\r\naltered to a sum certain; so much of it, as respected _first expenses_,\r\nor _outfit_, remained unaltered; and I might therefore expect, that the\r\nactual expenses for outfit were to be paid. When I prepared my account\r\nfor settlement with Mr. Barclay, I began a detail of the articles of\r\nclothing, carriage, horses, and household furniture. I found that they\r\nwere numerous, minute, and incapable, from their nature, of being vouched;\r\nand often entered in my memorandum book under a general head only, so\r\nthat I could not specify them. I found they would exceed a year's salary.\r\nSupposing, therefore, that mine being the first case, Congress would make\r\na precedent of it, and prefer a sum fixed for the outfit as well as the\r\nsalary, I have charged it in my account at a year's salary; presuming\r\nthere can be no question that an outfit is a reasonable charge. It is the\r\nusage here (and I suppose at all courts), that a minister resident, shall\r\nestablish his house in the first instant. If this is to be done out of\r\nhis salary, he will be a twelvemonth, at least, without a copper to live\r\non. It is the universal practice, therefore, of all nations, to allow the\r\noutfit as a separate article from the salary. I have inquired here into\r\nthe usual amount of it. I find that, sometimes, the sovereign pays the\r\nactual cost. This is particularly the case of the Sardinian ambassador now\r\ncoming here, who is to provide a service of plate, and every article of\r\nfurniture and other matters of first expense, to be paid for by his court.\r\nIn other instances, they give a service of plate, and a fixed sum for all\r\nother articles, which fixed sum is in no case lower than a year's salary.\r\n\r\nI desire no service of plate, having no ambition for splendor. My\r\nfurniture, carriage and apparel, are all plain, yet they have cost me\r\nmore than a year's salary. I suppose that in every country and in every\r\ncondition of life, a year's expense would be found a moderate measure for\r\nthe furniture of a man's house. It is not more certain to me, that the sun\r\nwill rise to-morrow, than that our government must allow the outfit, on\r\ntheir future appointment of foreign ministers; and it would be hard on me,\r\nso to stand between the discontinuance of a former rule, and institution\r\nof a future one, as to have the benefit of neither. I know, I have so long\r\nknown the character of our federal head, in its present form, that I have\r\nthe most unlimited confidence in the justice of its decisions. I think I\r\nam so far known to many of the present Congress, as that I may be cleared\r\nof all views of making money out of any public employment, or desiring\r\nanything beyond actual and decent expenses, proportioned to the station in\r\nwhich they have been pleased to place me, and to the respect they would\r\nwish to see attached to it. It would seem right, that they should decide\r\nthe claims of those who have acted under their administration, and their\r\npretermission of any article, might amount to a disallowance of it, in\r\nthe opinion of the new government. It would be painful to me, to meet that\r\ngovernment with a claim under this kind of cloud, and to pass it in review\r\nbefore their several Houses of legislation, and boards of administration,\r\nto whom I shall be unknown; and, being for money actually expended, it\r\nwould be too inconvenient to me to relinquish it in silence. I anxiously\r\nask it, therefore, to be decided on by Congress before they go out of\r\noffice, if it be not out of the line of proceeding they may have chalked\r\nout for themselves. If it be against their inclination to determine it,\r\nwould it be agreeable to them to refer it to the new government, by some\r\nresolution, which should show they have not meant to disallow it, by\r\npassing it over? Not knowing the circumstances under which Congress may\r\nexist and act at the moment you shall receive this, I am unable to judge\r\nwhat should be done on this subject. It is therefore that I ask the aid of\r\nyour friendship and that of Mr. Madison, that you will do for me in this\r\nregard, what you think it is right should be done, and what it would be\r\nright for me to do, were I on the spot, or were I apprised of all existing\r\ncircumstances. Indeed, were you two to think my claim an improper one,\r\nI would wish it to be suppressed, as I have so much confidence in your\r\njudgment, that I should suspect my own in any case, where it varied from\r\nyours, and more especially, in one where it is liable to be warped by\r\nfeeling. Give me leave, then, to ask your consultation with Mr. Madison\r\non this subject; and to assure you that whatever you are so good as to do\r\nherein, will be perfectly approved, and considered as a great obligation\r\nconferred on him, who has the honor to be, with sentiments of the most\r\nperfect esteem and attachment, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL CARRINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                                       PARIS, May 27, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have received with great pleasure your friendly letter\r\nof April 24th. It has come to hand after I had written my letters for\r\nthe present conveyance, and just in time to add this to them. I learn\r\nwith great pleasure the progress of the new Constitution. Indeed I have\r\npresumed it would gain on the public mind, as I confess it has on my own.\r\nAt first, though I saw that the great mass and groundwork was good, I\r\ndisliked many appendages. Reflection and discussion have cleared off most\r\nof these. You have satisfied me as to the query I had put to you about\r\nthe right of direct taxation. My first wish was that nine States would\r\nadopt it in order to ensure what was good in it, and that the others\r\nmight, by holding off, produce the necessary amendments. But the plan of\r\nMassachusetts is far preferable, and will, I hope, be followed by those\r\nwho are yet to decide. There are two amendments only which I am anxious\r\nfor: 1. A bill of rights, which it is so much the interest of all to\r\nhave, that I conceive it must be yielded. The 1st amendment proposed by\r\nMassachusetts will in some degree answer this end, but not so well. It\r\nwill do too much in some instances, and too little in others. It will\r\ncripple the Federal Government in some cases where it ought to be free,\r\nand not restrain in some others where restraint would be right. The 2d\r\namendment which appears to me essential is the restoring the principle of\r\nnecessary rotation, particularly to the Senate and Presidency: but most\r\nof all to the last. Re-eligibility makes him an officer for life, and the\r\ndisasters inseparable from an elective monarchy, render it preferable\r\nif we cannot tread back that step, that we should go forward and take\r\nrefuge in an hereditary one. Of the correction of this article, however,\r\nI entertain no present hope, because I find it has scarcely excited an\r\nobjection in America. And if it does not take place erelong, it assuredly\r\nnever will. The natural progress of things is for liberty to yield and\r\ngovernment to gain ground. As yet our spirits are free. Our jealousy is\r\nonly put to sleep by the unlimited confidence we all repose in the person\r\nto whom we all look as our president. After him inferior characters may\r\nperhaps succeed, and awaken us to the danger which his merit has led\r\nus into. For the present, however, the general adoption is to be prayed\r\nfor, and I wait with great anxiety for the news from Maryland and South\r\nCarolina, which have decided before this, and with that Virginia, now\r\nin session, may give the ninth vote of approbation. There could then be\r\nno doubt of North Carolina, New York, and New Hampshire. But what do you\r\npropose to do with Rhode Island? as long as there is hope we should give\r\nher time. I cannot conceive but that she will come to rights in the long\r\nrun. Force, in whatever form, would be a dangerous precedent.\r\n\r\nThere are rumors that the Austrian army is obliged to retire a little;\r\nthat the Spanish squadron is gone to South America; that the English\r\nhave excited a rebellion there; and some others equally unauthenticated.\r\nI do not mention them in my letter to Mr. Jay, because they are\r\nunauthenticated. The bankruptcies in London have re-commenced with new\r\nforce. There is no saying where this fire will end, perhaps in the general\r\nconflagration of all their paper. If not now, it must erelong. With only\r\ntwenty millions of coin, and three or four hundred millions of circulating\r\npaper, public and private, nothing is necessary but a general panic,\r\nproduced either by failures, invasion, or any other cause, and the whole\r\nvisionary fabric vanishes into air, and shows that paper is poverty,\r\nthat it is only the ghost of money, and not money itself. One hundred\r\nyears ago, they had twenty odd millions of coin. Since that they have\r\nbrought in from Holland by borrowing forty millions more, yet they have\r\nbut twenty millions left, and they talk of being rich, and of having the\r\nbalance of trade in their favor. Paul Jones is invited into the Empress'\r\nservice, with the rank of rear Admiral, and to have a separate command.\r\nI wish it corresponded with the views of Congress to give him that rank\r\nfrom the taking of the Serapis. I look to this officer as our great future\r\ndependence on the sea, where alone we should think of ever having a force.\r\nHe is young enough to see the day when we shall be more populous than the\r\nwhole British dominions, and able to fight them ship to ship. We should\r\nprocure him, then, every possible opportunity of acquiring experience.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem, dear\r\nSir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.[F]\r\n\r\n                                                       PARIS, May 28, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The enclosed letter for Mr. Jay, being of a private nature, I\r\nhave thought it better to put it under your cover, lest it might be opened\r\nby some of his clerks, in the case of his absence. But I enclose a press\r\ncopy of it for yourself, as you will perceive the subject of it referred\r\nto you, as well as to him. I ask your aid in it so far as you think right,\r\nand to have done what you think right. If you will now be so good as to\r\ncast your eye over the copy enclosed, what follows the present sentence,\r\nwill be some details, supplementary to that only, necessary for your\r\ninformation, but not proper for me to state to Mr. Jay.\r\n\r\n378,227,1247. though appointed a minister resident at the court of 514. he\r\nnever was 663. in that character. He was continually passing from 1042. to\r\n514. and 514. to 1042. so that he had no occasion to establish a household\r\nat either. Accordingly, he stayed principally in furnished lodgings. Of\r\nall our ministers, he had the least occasion for an outfit, and I suppose,\r\nspent almost nothing on that article. He was of a disposition, too, to\r\nrestrain himself within any limits of expense whatever, and it suited his\r\nrecluse turn, which is, to avoid society. Should he judge of what others\r\nshould do, by what he did, it would be an improper criterion. He was in\r\nEurope as a _voyageur_ only, and it was while the salary was five hundred\r\nguineas more than at present.\r\n\r\n145.1267.1046.7. he came over when, instead of outfit and salary, all\r\nexpenses were paid. Of rigorous honesty, and careless of appearances, he\r\nlived for a considerable time, as an economical private individual. After\r\nhe was fixed at 812.141. and the salary at a sum certain, he continued his\r\neconomical style, till out of the difference between his expenses and his\r\nsalary, he could purchase furniture for his house. This was the easier, as\r\nthe salary was at two thousand five hundred guineas then. He was obliged\r\ntoo, to be passing between 1042. and 812.141. so as to avoid any regular\r\ncurrent of expenses. When he established himself, his pecuniary affairs\r\nwere under the direction of 964. 814.7.101.994. one of the most estimable\r\ncharacters on earth, and the most attentive and honorable economists.\r\nNeither had a wish to lay up a copper, but both wished to make both ends\r\nmeet. I suspected, however, from an expression dropped in conversation,\r\nthat they were not able to do this, and that a deficit in their accounts\r\nappeared in their winding up. If this conjecture be true, it is a proof\r\nthat the salary, so far from admitting savings, is unequal to a very plain\r\nstyle of life; for such was theirs. I presume Congress will be asked to\r\nallow it, and it is evident to me, from what I saw while in 1093. that it\r\nought to be done, as they did not expend a shilling which should have been\r\navoided. Would it be more eligible to set the example of making good a\r\ndeficit, or to give him an outfit, which will cover it? The impossibility\r\nof living on the sum allowed, respectably, was the true cause of his\r\ninsisting on his recall.\r\n\r\n821.267.1292. He came over while all expenses were paid. He rented a house\r\nwith standing furniture, such as tables, chairs, presses, &c., and bought\r\nall other necessaries. The latter were charged in his account, the former\r\nwas included in the article of house-rent, and paid during the whole time\r\nof his stay here; and as the established rate of hire for furniture, is\r\nfrom thirty to forty per cent. per annum, the standing furniture must have\r\nbeen paid for three times over, during the eight years he stayed here. His\r\nsalary was two thousand five hundred guineas. When Congress reduced it to\r\nless than two thousand, he refused to accede to it, asked his recall, and\r\ninsisted that whenever they chose to alter the conditions on which he came\r\nout, if he did not approve of it, they ought to replace him in America on\r\nthe old conditions. He lived plainly, but as decently as his salary would\r\nallow. He saved nothing, but avoided debt. He knew he could not do this on\r\nthe reduced salary, and therefore asked his recall with decision.\r\n\r\nTo 935.145. succeeded. He had established a certain style of living.\r\nThe same was expected from 1214. and there were five hundred guineas\r\na year less, to do it on. It has been aimed at, however, as far as was\r\npracticable. This rendered it constantly necessary to step neither to\r\nthe right nor to the left, to incur any expense which could possibly be\r\navoided, and it called for an almost womanly attention to the details\r\nof the household, equally perplexing, disgusting, and inconsistent with\r\nbusiness. You will be sensible, that in this situation, no savings could\r\nbe made for reimbursing the half year's salary, ordered to be advanced\r\nunder the former commission, and more than as much again, which was\r\nunavoidably so applied without order, for the purchase of the outfit. The\r\nreason of the thing, the usage of all nations, the usage of our own, by\r\npaying all expenses of preceding ministers, which gave them the outfit, as\r\nfar as their circumstances appeared to them to render it necessary, have\r\nmade me take for granted all along, that it would not be refused to me;\r\nnor should I have mentioned it now, but that the administration is passing\r\ninto other hands, and more complicated forms. It would be disagreeable to\r\nme, to be presented to them in the first instance, as a suitor. Men come\r\ninto business at first, with visionary principles. It is practice alone,\r\nwhich can correct and conform them to the actual current of affairs. In\r\nthe meantime, those to whom their errors were first applied, have been\r\ntheir victims. The government may take up the project of appointing\r\nforeign ministers without outfits, and they may ruin two or three\r\nindividuals, before they find that that article is just as indispensable\r\nas the salary. They must then fall into the current of general usage,\r\nwhich has become general, only because experience has established its\r\nnecessity. Upon the whole, be so good as to reflect on it, and to do,\r\nnot what your friendship to me, but your opinion of what is right shall\r\ndictate. Accept, in all cases, assurances of the sincere esteem and\r\nrespect with which I am, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n    [F] [It will be seen that a few words of this letter are in\r\n    cypher.

Still, I supposed it\r\non its way to you, when a few days ago, having occasion to look among\r\nsome papers in the drawer, where my letters are usually put away, till an\r\nopportunity of sending them occurs, I found that this letter had slipped\r\namong them, so that it had never been forwarded. I am sorry for it, on\r\naccount of the remarks relative to the Spanish language only. Apply to\r\nthat, with all the assiduity you can. That language and the English\r\ncovering nearly the whole face of America, they should be well known\r\nto every inhabitant, who means to look beyond the limits of his farm.\r\nI like well the distribution of your time, mentioned in your letter of\r\nMarch the 18th; and the counsels of Mr. Wythe, so kindly extended to you,\r\nleave it necessary for me to add nothing of that kind. Be assiduous in\r\nlearning, take much exercise for your health, and practice much virtue.\r\nHealth, learning and virtue, will insure your happiness; they will give\r\nyou a quiet conscience, private esteem and public honor. Beyond these, we\r\nwant nothing but physical necessaries, and they are easily obtained. My\r\ndaughters are well, and join me in love to yourself, your mother, brothers\r\nand sisters. I am, with very sincere esteem, dear Peter, your affectionate\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n    [G] [For the letter referred to, see ante, p. 237.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COMTE DE BERNSTORFF.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, June 19, 1788.\r\n\r\nI had the honor of addressing your Excellency, by Admiral Paul Jones, on\r\nthe 21st of January, on the subject of the prizes taken under his command\r\nduring the late war, and sent into Bergen. I communicated, at the same\r\ntime, a copy of the powers which the Congress of the United States of\r\nAmerica had been pleased to confide to me therein, having previously shown\r\nthe original to the Baron Blome, envoy extraordinary of his Majesty, the\r\nKing of Denmark, at this court; and I furnished, at the same time, to\r\nAdmiral Paul Jones, such authority as I was empowered to delegate, for\r\nthe arrangement of this affair. That officer has transmitted me a copy\r\nof your Excellency's letter to him, of the 4th of April, wherein you\r\nare pleased to observe, that the want of full powers on his part was an\r\ninvincible obstacle to the definitive discussion of this claim with him,\r\nand to express your dispositions to institute a settlement at this place.\r\nAlways assured of the justice and honor of the court of Denmark, and\r\nencouraged by the particular readiness of your Excellency to settle and\r\nremove this difficulty from between the two nations, I take the liberty of\r\nrecalling your attention to it. The place of negotiation proposed by your\r\nExcellency, meets no objection from us, and it removes, at the same time,\r\nthat which the want of full powers in Admiral Paul Jones, had produced\r\nin your mind. These full powers, Congress have been pleased to honor me\r\nwith. The arrangement taken between the person to be charged with your\r\nfull powers, and myself, will be final and conclusive. You are pleased to\r\nexpress a willingness to treat at the same time, on the subjects of amity\r\nand commerce. The powers formerly communicated on our part, were given to\r\nMr. Adams, Dr. Franklin and myself, for a limited term only. That term\r\nhas expired, and the other two gentlemen returned to America: so that\r\nno person is commissioned at this moment, to renew those conferences.\r\nI may safely, however, assure your Excellency, that the same friendly\r\ndispositions still continue, and the same desire of facilitating and\r\nencouraging a commerce between the two nations, which produced the former\r\nappointment. But our nation is, at this time, proposing a change in the\r\norganization of its government. For this change to be agreed to by all\r\nthe members of the Union, the new administration chosen and brought into\r\nactivity, their domestic matters arranged, which will require their first\r\nattention, their foreign system afterwards decided on and carried into\r\nfull execution, will require very considerable length of time. To place\r\nunder the same delay, the private claims which I have the honor to present\r\nto your Excellency, would be hard on the persons interested; because\r\nthese claims have no connection with the system of commercial connection,\r\nwhich may be established between the two nations, nor with the particular\r\nform of our administration. The justice due to them is complete, and the\r\npresent administration as competent to final settlement as any future one\r\nwill be, should a future change take place. These individuals have already\r\nlingered nine years, in expectation of their hard and perilous earnings.\r\nTime lessens their numbers continually, disperses their representatives,\r\nweakens the evidence of their right, and renders more and more\r\nimpracticable, his majesty's dispositions to repair the private injury, to\r\nwhich public circumstances constrained him. These considerations, the just\r\nand honorable intentions of your Excellency, and the assurances you give\r\nus in your letter, that no delay is wished on your part, give me strong\r\nhopes that we may speedily obtain that final arrangement, which express\r\ninstructions render it my duty to urge. I have the honor, therefore,\r\nof agreeing with your Excellency, that the settlement of this matter,\r\nformerly begun at Paris, shall be continued there: and to ask that you\r\nwill be pleased to give powers and instructions for this purpose, to such\r\npersons as you shall think proper, and in such full form as may prevent\r\nthose delays, to which the distance between Copenhagen and Paris might\r\notherwise expose us.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most profound respect, your\r\nExcellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. THOMAS DIGGES.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, June 19, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your favor of May 12, as well as that of the\r\nperson who desires information on the state of cotton manufactures in\r\nAmerica, and for his interest and safety I beg leave to address to you the\r\nanswer to his queries.\r\n\r\nIn general, it is impossible that manufactures should succeed in America,\r\nfrom the high price of labor. This is occasioned by the great demand\r\nof labor for agriculture. A manufacturer going from Europe will turn to\r\nlabor of other kinds if he finds more to be got by it, and he finds some\r\nemployment so profitable, that he can soon lay up money enough to buy\r\nfifty acres of land, to the culture of which he is irresistibly tempted\r\nby the independence in which that places him, and the desire of having\r\na wife and family around him. If any manufactures can succeed there, it\r\nwill be that of cotton. I must observe for his information that this plant\r\ngrows nowhere in the United States northward of the Potomac, and not in\r\nquantity till you get southward as far as York and James Rivers. I know\r\nnothing of the manufacture which is said to be set up at Richmond. It must\r\nhave taken place since 1783, when I left Virginia. In that State (for\r\nit is the only one I am enabled to speak of with certainty) there is no\r\nmanufacture of wire or of cotton cards; or if any, it is not worth notice.\r\nNo manufacture of stocking-weaving, consequently none for making the\r\nmachine; none of cotton clothing of any kind whatever for sale; though in\r\nalmost every family some is manufactured for the use of the family, which\r\nis always good in quality, and often tolerably fine. In the same way they\r\nmake excellent stockings of cotton, weaving it in like manner, carried on\r\nprincipally in the family way: among the poor, the wife weaves generally;\r\nand the rich either have a weaver among their servants or employ their\r\npoor neighbors. Cotton cost in Virginia from 12_d._ to 18_d._ sterling the\r\npound before the war, probably it is a little raised since. Richmond is as\r\ngood a place for a manufactory as any in that State, and perhaps the best\r\nas to its resources for this business. Cotton clothing is very much the\r\ntaste of the country. A manufacturer, on his landing, should apply to the\r\nwell-informed farmers and gentlemen of the country. Their information will\r\nbe more disinterested than that of merchants, and they can better put\r\nhim into the way of disposing of his workmen in the cheapest manner till\r\nhe has time to look about him and decide how and where he will establish\r\nhimself. Such is the hospitality in that country, and their disposition\r\nto assist strangers, that he may boldly go to any good house he sees,\r\nand make the inquiry he needs. He will be sure to be kindly received,\r\nhonestly informed, and accommodated in an hospitable way, without any\r\nother introduction than an information who he is and what are his views.\r\nIt is not the policy of the government in that country to give any aid\r\nto works of any kind. They let things take their natural course without\r\nhelp or impediment, which is generally the best policy. More particularly\r\nas to myself, I must say that I have not the authority nor the means of\r\nassisting any persons in their passage to that country. I have the honor\r\nto be, with sentiments of perfect esteem, Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. RUTLEDGE.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, January 19, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Having omitted to ask you how I should address letters to you,\r\nI am obliged to put the present under cover to Mr. Shippen, to the care\r\nof his banker at Amsterdam. Enclosed you will receive a letter lately\r\ncome to my hands, as also such notes as I have been able to scribble very\r\nhastily and undigested. I am ashamed of them; but I will pay willingly\r\nthat price, if they may, on a single occasion, be useful to you. I will at\r\nsome future moment find time to write the letters for Frankfort, Florence,\r\nMilan, Nice and Marseilles, which those notes will point out, and lodge\r\nthem on your route, if you will be so good as to keep me always informed\r\nhow and where I must send letters to you. I would suggest an alteration\r\nin the route I had proposed to you; that is, to descend the Danube from\r\nVienna, so as to go to Constantinople, and from thence to Naples and\r\nup Italy. This must depend on your time, and the information you may be\r\nable to get as to the safety with which you may pass through the Ottoman\r\nterritories. It is believed the Emperor is making overtures for peace.\r\nShould this take place it would lessen the difficulties of such a tour.\r\nIn the meantime, this gleam of peace is counterbalanced by the warlike\r\npreparations of Sweden and Denmark, known to be made under the suggestions\r\nof the Court of London. In this country there is great internal ferment.\r\nI am of opinion the new regulations will be maintained. Perhaps the\r\nCour pleniere may be amended in its composition, and the States General\r\ncalled at an earlier period than was intended. We have no accounts yet of\r\nthe decision of Maryland, South Carolina, or Virginia on the subject of\r\nthe new Constitution. Yet it seems probable they will accept it in the\r\nsame manner Massachusetts has done; and I see nothing improbable in the\r\nsupposition that our new government may be in motion by the beginning of\r\nNovember. I must press on you, my dear Sir, a very particular attention\r\nto the climate and culture of the olive tree. This is the most interesting\r\nplant in existence for South Carolina and Georgia. You will see in various\r\nplaces that it gives being to whole villages in places where there is\r\nnot soil enough to subsist a family by the means of any other culture.\r\nBut consider it as the means of bettering the condition of your slaves in\r\nSouth Carolina. See in the poorer parts of France and Italy what a number\r\nof vegetables are rendered eatable by the aid of a little oil, which would\r\notherwise be useless. Remark very particularly the northern limits of this\r\ntree, and whether it exists by the help of shelter from the mountains,\r\n&c. I know this is the case in France. I wish to know where the northern\r\nlimit of this plant crosses the Apennines; where it crosses the Adriatic\r\nand the Archipelago, and if possible what course it takes through Asia.\r\nThe fig, the dried raisin, the pistache, the date, the caper, are all very\r\ninteresting objects for your study. Should you not in your passage through\r\ncountries where they are cultivated inform yourself of their hardiness,\r\ntheir culture, the manner of transporting, &c., you might hereafter much\r\nrepent it. Both then and now I hope you will excuse me for suggesting them\r\nto your attention; not omitting the article of rice also, of which you\r\nwill see species different from your own. I beg you to make use of me on\r\nall possible occasions and in all the ways in which I can serve you, not\r\nomitting that of money, should any disappointment take place in your own\r\narrangements. Mr. Berard's money was paid to Bayoker & Co. as you desired.\r\nI have the honor to be, with very great esteem, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO T. LEE SHIPPEN, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, June 19, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have been honored with your favor of May 20, and take the\r\nfirst possible moment of acknowledging it, and of enclosing such notes\r\nas my recollection has suggested to me might be of service to you on\r\nyour route. They have been scribbled so hastily and so informally that I\r\nwould not send them, did not a desire of accommodating yourself and Mr.\r\nRutledge get the better of my self-love. You will have seen in the Leyden\r\ngazette the principal articles of intelligence received from America\r\nsince you left us, and which I have furnished to Mr. Dumas for that\r\npaper. The account of the riot in New York was given me by Mr. Paradise,\r\nwho was there at the time, and who with his lady is now here. You may,\r\nperhaps, meet them at Venice. Mr. Jay and Baron Steuben were wounded with\r\nstones in that riot. General Washington writes me word he thinks Virginia\r\nwill accept of the new Constitution. It appears to me, in fact, from\r\nall information, that its rejection would drive the States to despair\r\nand bring on events which cannot be foreseen; and that its adoption\r\nis become absolutely necessary. It will be easier to get the assent\r\nof nine States to correct what is wrong in the way pointed out by the\r\nConstitution itself, than to get thirteen to concur in a new convention\r\nand another plan of confederation. I therefore sincerely pray that the\r\nremaining States may accept it, as Massachusetts has done, with standing\r\ninstructions to their delegates to press for amendments till they are\r\nobtained. They cannot fail of being obtained when the delegates of eight\r\nStates shall be under such perpetual instructions. The American newspapers\r\nsay that the Spaniards have sunk one of our boats on the Mississippi, and\r\nwe one of theirs, by way of reprisal. The silence of my letters on the\r\nsubject makes me hope it is not true. Be so good as to keep me constantly\r\nfurnished with your address. I will take the first moment I can to write\r\nletters for you to Baron Leimer for Frankfort, Febroni at Florence,\r\nthe Count del Verme and Clerici at Milan, Sasserns at Nice, Cathalan at\r\nMarseilles, which at this time it is impossible for me to do. I beg you\r\nto make on all occasions all the use of me of which I am susceptible, and\r\nin any way in which your occasions may require, and to be assured of the\r\nsentiments of sincere esteem and attachment with which I have the honor to\r\nbe, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE MONTMORIN.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, June 20, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Having had the honor of mentioning to your Excellency the wish\r\nof Congress that certain changes should be made in the articles for\r\na consular convention, which had been sent to them, I have now that,\r\nconformably to the desire you expressed, of giving a general idea of the\r\nalterations to be proposed.\r\n\r\nThe fourth article gives to the consuls the immunities of the law of\r\nnations. It has been understood, however, that the laws of France do not\r\nadmit of this; and that it might be desirable to expunge this article.\r\nIn this we are ready to concur, as in every other case where an article\r\nmight call for changes in the established laws, either inconvenient or\r\ndisagreeable.\r\n\r\nAfter establishing in favor of consuls, the general immunities of the law\r\nof nations, one consequence of which would have been, that they could not\r\nhave been called upon to give testimony in courts of justice, the fifth\r\narticle requires that after the observance of certain formalities, which\r\nimply very high respect, they shall make a declaration; but _in their\r\nown houses_ [chez eux] as may be pretended, if not justly inferred, from\r\nthe expressions in the article. But our laws require, indispensably, a\r\npersonal examination of witnesses in the presence of the parties, of their\r\ncounsel, the jury and judges, each of whom has a right to ask of them all\r\nquestions pertinent to the fact. The first and highest officers of our\r\ngovernment are obliged to appear personally to the order of a court to\r\ngive evidence. The court takes care that they are treated with respect. It\r\nis proposed, therefore, to omit this article for these particular reasons,\r\nas well as for the general one, that the fourth being expunged, this,\r\nwhich was but an exception to that, falls of course.\r\n\r\nThe seventh, eighth, tenth and fourteenth articles extend their\r\npre-eminences far beyond those which the laws of nations would have\r\ngiven. These articles require that the declarations made in the presence\r\nof consuls, and certified by them, shall be received in evidence in\r\nall courts whatever; and in some instances give to their certificates\r\na credibility which excludes all other testimony. The cases are rare\r\nin which our laws admit written evidence of facts; and such evidence,\r\nwhen admitted, must have been given in the presence of both parties,\r\nand must contain the answers to all the pertinent questions which they\r\nmay have desired to ask of the witness; and to no evidence, of whatever\r\nnature, written or oral, do our laws give so high credit, as to exclude\r\nall counter-proof. These principles are of such ancient foundation in\r\nour system of jurisprudence, and are so much valued and venerated by our\r\ncitizens, that perhaps it would be impossible to execute articles which\r\nshould contravene them, nor is it imagined that these stipulations can\r\nbe so interesting to this country, as to balance the inconvenience and\r\nhazard of such an innovation with us. Perhaps it might be found, that the\r\nlaws of both countries require a modification of this article; as it is\r\ninconceivable that the certificate of an American consul in France could\r\nbe permitted by one of its courts to establish a fact, the falsehood of\r\nwhich should be notorious to the court itself.\r\n\r\nThe eighth article gives to the consuls of either nation a jurisdiction,\r\nin certain cases, over foreigners of any other. On a dispute arising in\r\nFrance, between an American and a Spaniard or an Englishman, it would not\r\nbe fair to abandon the Spaniard or Englishman to an American consul. On\r\nthe contrary, the territorial judge, as neutral, would seem to be the most\r\nimpartial. Probably, therefore, it will be thought convenient for both\r\nparties to correct this stipulation.\r\n\r\nA dispute arising between two subjects of France, the one being in France,\r\nand the other in the United States, the regular tribunals of France would\r\nseem entitled to a preference of jurisdiction. Yet the twelfth article\r\ngives it to their consul in America; and to the consul of the United\r\nStates in France, in a like case between their citizens.\r\n\r\nThe power given by the tenth article, of arresting and sending back a\r\nvessel, its captain, and crew, is a very great one indeed, and, in our\r\nopinion, more safely lodged with the territorial judge. We would ourselves\r\ntrust the tribunals of France to decide when there is just cause for\r\nso high-handed an act of authority over the persons and property of so\r\nmany of our citizens, to all of whom these tribunals will stand in a\r\nneutral and impartial relation, rather than any single person whom we\r\nmay appoint as consul, who will seldom be learned in the laws, and often\r\nsusceptible of influence from private interest and personal pique. With\r\nus, applications for the arrest of vessels, and of their masters, are\r\nmade to the admiralty courts. These are composed of the most learned and\r\nvirtuous characters of the several States, and the maritime law common\r\nto all nations, is the rule of their proceedings. The exercise of foreign\r\njurisdiction, within the pale of their own laws, in a very high case, and\r\nwherein those laws have made honorable provisions, would be a phenomenon\r\nnever yet seen in our country, and which would be seen with great jealousy\r\nand uneasiness. On the contrary, to leave this power with the territorial\r\njudge, will inspire confidence and friendship, and be really, at the same\r\ntime, more secure against abuse. The power of arresting deserted seamen\r\nseems necessary for the purposes of navigation and commerce, and will\r\nbe more attentively and effectually exercised by the consul, than by the\r\nterritorial judge. To this part of the tenth article, therefore, as well\r\nas to that which requires the territorial judge to assist the consul in\r\nthe exercise of this function, we can accede. But the extension of the\r\nlike power to passengers, seems not necessary for the purposes either of\r\nnavigation or commerce. It does not come, therefore, within the functions\r\nof the consul, whose institution is for those two objects only, nor\r\nwithin the powers of a commissioner, authorized to treat and conclude a\r\nconvention, solely for regulating the powers, privileges, and duties of\r\nconsuls. The arrest and detention of passengers, moreover, would often be\r\nin contradiction to our bills of rights, which being fundamental, cannot\r\nbe obstructed in their operation by any law or convention whatever.\r\n\r\nConsular institutions being entirely new with us, Congress think it wise\r\nto make their first convention probationary, and not perpetual. They\r\npropose, therefore, a clause for limiting its duration to a certain term\r\nof years. If after the experience of a few years, it should be found to\r\nanswer the purposes intended by it, both parties will have sufficient\r\ninducements to renew it, either in its present form, or with such\r\nalterations and amendments as time, experience, and other circumstances\r\nmay indicate.\r\n\r\nThe convention, as expressed in the French language, will fully answer\r\nour purposes in France, because it will there be understood. But it\r\nwill not equally answer the purposes of France in America, because it\r\nwill not there be understood. In very few of the courts wherein it may\r\nbe presented, will there be found a single judge or advocate capable\r\nof translating it at all, much less of giving to all its terms, legal\r\nand technical, their exact equivalent in the laws and language of that\r\ncountry. Should any translation which Congress would undertake to publish,\r\nfor the use of our courts, be conceived on any occasion not to render\r\nfully the idea of the French original, it might be imputed as an indirect\r\nattempt to abridge or extend the terms of a contract, at the will of one\r\nparty only. At no place are there better helps than here, for establishing\r\nan English text equivalent to the French, in all its phrases; no person\r\ncan be supposed to know what is meant by these phrases better than those\r\nwho form them; and no time more proper to ascertain their meaning in both\r\nlanguages, than that at which they are formed. I have, therefore, the\r\nhonor to propose, that the convention shall be faithfully expressed in\r\nEnglish as well as in French, in two columns, side by side, that these\r\ncolumns be declared each of them to be text, and to be equally original\r\nand authentic in all courts of justice.\r\n\r\nThis, Sir, is a general sketch of the alterations which our laws and\r\nour manner of thinking render necessary in this convention, before the\r\nfaith of our country is engaged for its execution. Some of its articles,\r\nin their present form, could not be executed at all, and others would\r\nproduce embarrassments and ill humor, to which it would not be prudent\r\nfor our government to commit itself. Inexact execution on the one part,\r\nwould naturally beget dissatisfaction and complaints on the other, and\r\nan instrument intended to strengthen our connection, might thus become\r\nthe means of loosening it. Fewer articles, better observed, will better\r\npromote our common interests. As to ourselves, we do not find the\r\ninstitution of consuls very necessary. Its history commences in times of\r\nbarbarism, and might well have ended with them. During these, they were\r\nperhaps useful, and may still be so, in countries, not yet emerged from\r\nthat condition. But all civilized nations at this day, understand so well\r\nthe advantages of commerce, that they provide protection and encouragement\r\nfor merchant strangers and vessels coming among them. So extensive, too,\r\nhave commercial connections now become, that every mercantile house has\r\ncorrespondents in almost every port. They address their vessels to these\r\ncorrespondents, who are found to take better care of their interests, and\r\nto obtain more effectually the protection of the laws of the country for\r\nthem, than the consul of their nation can. He is generally a foreigner,\r\nunpossessed of the little details of knowledge of greatest use to them.\r\nHe makes national questions of all the difficulties which arise; the\r\ncorrespondent prevents them. We carry on commerce with good success in\r\nall parts of the world; yet we have not a consul in a single port, nor\r\na complaint for the want of one, except from the persons who wish to be\r\nconsuls themselves. Though these considerations may not be strong enough\r\nto establish the absolute inutility of consuls, they may make us less\r\nanxious to extend their privileges and jurisdictions, so as to render them\r\nobjects of jealousy and irritation in the places of their residence. That\r\nthis government thinks them useful, is sufficient reason for us to give\r\nthem all the functions and facilities which our circumstances will admit.\r\nInstead, therefore, of declining every article which will be useless to\r\nus, we accede to every one which will not be inconvenient. Had this nation\r\nbeen alone concerned, our desire to gratify them, might have tempted us\r\nto press still harder on the laws and opinions of our country. But your\r\nExcellency knows, that we stand engaged in treaties with some nations,\r\nwhich will give them occasion to claim whatever privileges we yield to\r\nany other. This renders circumspection more necessary. Permit me to add\r\none other observation. The English allow to foreign consuls scarcely any\r\nfunctions within their ports. This proceeds, in a great measure, from the\r\ncharacter of their laws, which eye with peculiar jealousy every exemption\r\nfrom their control. Ours are the same in their general character, and\r\nrendered still more unpliant, by our having thirteen parliaments to relax,\r\ninstead of one. Upon the whole, I hope your Excellency will see the causes\r\nof the delay which this convention has met with, in the difficulties it\r\npresents, and our desire to surmount them; and will be sensible that\r\nthe alterations proposed, are dictated to us by the necessity of our\r\ncircumstances, and by a caution, which cannot be disapproved, to commit\r\nourselves to no engagements which we foresee we might not be able to\r\nfulfil.\r\n\r\nThese alterations, with some other smaller ones, which may be offered on\r\nthe sole principle of joint convenience, shall be the subject of more\r\nparticular explanation, whenever your Excellency shall honor me with a\r\nconference thereon. I shall then also point out the verbal changes which\r\nappear to me necessary, to accommodate the instrument to the views before\r\nexpressed. In the meantime, I have the honor to be, with sentiments of the\r\nmost perfect respect and esteem, your Excellency's most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ---- ----.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, June 28, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,-- * * * * * * * * A treaty of alliance between England and Prussia\r\nwas signed on the 13th instant. Sweden is believed to have given out a\r\ndeclaration of the reasons of her arming, which has very much the air\r\nof a declaration of war against Russia. We have not yet seen it here. It\r\nwould not be unexpected to hear that she has commenced hostilities. She\r\nis subsidized by England, and if she does begin a war, we must believe\r\nit to be on the instigation of England, with a view to bring on a general\r\nwar. This power, with Denmark and Holland, ranging themselves on the side\r\nof England, destroys the equilibrium of power at sea, which we had hoped\r\nwas established. I am, with great esteem, Sir, your most obedient humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR DIRIEKS.\r\n\r\n                                                       PARIS, July 2, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--As a private individual and citizen of America, I can with propriety\r\nand truth deliver it to you as my firm belief, that the loan office\r\ncertificate you showed me, and all others of the same kind, will be paid,\r\nprincipal and interest, as soon as the circumstances of the United States\r\nwill permit: that I do not consider this as a distant epoch, nor suppose\r\nthere is a public debt on earth less doubtful. This I speak as my private\r\nopinion. But it does not belong to me to say that it will be paid in\r\ntwo years, or that it will be paid at all, so as by the authority of my\r\naffirmation to give it any new sanction or credit. The board of treasury\r\nor Congress can alone do this. You will be sensible, therefore, Sir, of\r\nthe impropriety, and even the hazard, of my going out of the line of my\r\noffice so far as to undertake, or to aver, that these certificates will\r\nbe paid within one or two years. On every occasion where I can do it of\r\nright, I shall be happy to render you every possible service, being with\r\nsentiments of the most perfect esteem, Sir, your most obedient humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO T. L. SHIPPEN, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, July 13, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--In a former letter to Mr. Rutledge, I suggested to him the idea\r\nof extending his tour to Constantinople, and in one of to-day, I mention\r\nit again. I do not know how far that extension may accord with your plan,\r\nnor indeed how far it may be safe for either of you; for, though it has\r\nbeen thought there has been a relaxation in the warlike dispositions\r\nof the belligerent powers, yet we have no symptoms of a suspension of\r\nhostilities. The Ottoman dominions are generally represented as unsafe\r\nfor travellers, even when in peace. They must be much more so during\r\nwar. This article, therefore, merits exact inquiry before that journey is\r\nundertaken.\r\n\r\nWe have letters from America to June 11. Maryland has acceded to the\r\nConstitution by a vote of 63 to 11, and South Carolina by 149 to 72. Mr.\r\nHenry had disseminated propositions there for a Southern confederacy.\r\nIt is now thought that Virginia will not hesitate to accede. Governor\r\nRandolph has come over to the Federalists. No doubt is entertained of New\r\nHampshire and North Carolina, and it is thought that even New York will\r\nagree when she sees she will be left with Rhode Island alone. Two-thirds\r\nof their Convention are decidedly anti-federal. The die is now thrown, and\r\nit cannot be many days before we know what has finally turned up. Congress\r\nhas granted the prayer of Kentucky to be made independent, and a committee\r\nwas occupied in preparing an act for that purpose. Mr. Barlow, the\r\nAmerican poet, is arrived in Paris.\r\n\r\nWe expect daily to hear that the Swedes have commenced hostilities.\r\nWhether this will draw in the other nations of Europe immediately,\r\ncannot be foreseen; probably it will in the long run. I sincerely wish\r\nthis country may be able previously to arrange its internal affairs. To\r\nspare the trouble of repetition, I am obliged to ask of yourself and Mr.\r\nRutledge, to consider the letter of each as a supplement to the other.\r\nUnder the possibility, however, of your going different routes, I enclose\r\nduplicates of my letters of introduction. After acknowledging the receipt\r\nof your favor of the 6th inst., from Spa, I shall only beg a continuance\r\nof them, and that you will both keep me constantly informed how to convey\r\nletters to you; and to assure you of those sentiments of sincere esteem\r\nwith which I have the honor to be, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR GORDON.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, July 16, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In your favor of the 8th instant, you mentioned that you had written\r\nto me in February last. This letter never came to hand. That of April the\r\n24th came here during my absence on a journey through Holland and Germany;\r\nand my having been obliged to devote the first moments after my return,\r\nto some very pressing matters, must be my apology for not having been able\r\nto write to you till now. As soon as I knew that it would be agreeable to\r\nyou, to have such a disposal of your work for translation, as I had made\r\nfor Dr. Ramsay, I applied to the same bookseller with propositions on your\r\nbehalf. He told me, that he had lost so much by that work, that he could\r\nhardly think of undertaking another, and at any rate, not without first\r\nseeing and examining it. As he was the only bookseller I could induce to\r\ngive anything on the former occasion, I went to no other with my proposal,\r\nmeaning to ask you to send me immediately as much of the work as is\r\nprinted. This you can do by the Diligence, which comes three times a week\r\nfrom London to Paris. Furnished with this, I will renew my proposition,\r\nand do the best for you I can; though I fear that the ill success of the\r\ntranslation of Dr. Ramsay's work, and of another work on the subject of\r\nAmerica, will permit less to be done for you than I had hoped. I think Dr.\r\nRamsay failed from the inelegance of the translation, and the translator's\r\nhaving departed entirely from the Doctor's instructions. I will be obliged\r\nto you, to set me down as a subscriber for half a dozen copies, and to ask\r\nMr. Trumbull (No. 2, North street, Rathbone Place) to pay you the whole\r\nsubscription price for me, which he will do on showing him this letter.\r\nThese copies can be sent by the Diligence. I have not yet received the\r\npictures Mr. Trumbull was to send me, nor consequently that of M. de La\r\nFayette. I will take care of it when it arrives. His title is simply, _le\r\nMarquis de La Fayette_.\r\n\r\nYou ask, in your letter of April the 24th, details of my sufferings by\r\nColonel Tarleton. I did not suffer by him. On the contrary, he behaved\r\nvery genteelly with me. On his approach to Charlottesville, which is\r\nwithin three miles of my house at Monticello, he despatched a troop of his\r\nhorse, under Captain McLeod, with the double object of taking me prisoner,\r\nwith the two Speakers of the Senate and Delegates, who then lodged with\r\nme, and of remaining there in _vidette_, my house commanding a view of ten\r\nor twelve miles round about. He gave strict orders to Captain McLeod to\r\nsuffer nothing to be injured. The troop failed in one of their objects,\r\nas we had notice of their coming, so that the two Speakers had gone off\r\nabout two hours before their arrival at Monticello, and myself, with\r\nmy family, about five minutes. But Captain McLeod preserved everything\r\nwith sacred care, during about eighteen hours that he remained there.\r\nColonel Tarleton was just so long at Charlottesville, being hurried from\r\nthence by the news of the rising of the militia, and by a sudden fall\r\nof rain, which threatened to swell the river, and intercept his return.\r\nIn general, he did little injury to the inhabitants, on that short and\r\nhasty excursion, which was of about sixty miles from their main army,\r\nthen in Spotsylvania, and ours in Orange. It was early in June, 1781. Lord\r\nCornwallis then proceeded to the Point of Fork, and encamped his army from\r\nthence all along the main James River, to a seat of mine called Elk-hill,\r\nopposite to Elk Island, and a little below the mouth of the Byrd Creek.\r\n(You will see all these places exactly laid down in the map annexed to my\r\nnotes on Virginia, printed by Stockdale.) He remained in this position\r\nten days, his own head quarters being in my house, at that place. I had\r\ntime to remove most of the effects out of the house. He destroyed all my\r\ngrowing crops of corn and tobacco; he burned all my barns, containing the\r\nsame articles of the last year, having first taken what corn he wanted;\r\nhe used, as was to be expected, all my stock of cattle, sheep and hogs,\r\nfor the sustenance of his army, and carried off all the horses capable of\r\nservice; of those too young for service he cut the throats; and he burned\r\nall the fences on the plantation, so as to leave it an absolute waste. He\r\ncarried off also about thirty slaves. Had this been to give them freedom,\r\nhe would have done right; but it was to consign them to inevitable death\r\nfrom the small pox and putrid fever, then raging in his camp. This I knew\r\nafterwards to be the fate of twenty-seven of them. I never had news of\r\nthe remaining three, but presume they shared the same fate. When I say\r\nthat Lord Cornwallis did all this, I do not mean that he carried about\r\nthe torch in his own hands, but that it was all done under his eye; the\r\nsituation of the house in which he was, commanding a view of every part\r\nof the plantation, so that he must have seen every fire. I relate these\r\nthings on my own knowledge, in a great degree, as I was on the ground soon\r\nafter he left it. He treated the rest of the neighborhood somewhat in the\r\nsame style, but not with that spirit of total extermination with which\r\nhe seemed to rage over my possessions. Wherever he went, the dwelling\r\nhouses were plundered of everything which could be carried off. Lord\r\nCornwallis' character in England, would forbid the belief that he shared\r\nin the plunder; but that his table was served with the plate thus pillaged\r\nfrom private houses, can be proved by many hundred eye-witnesses. From an\r\nestimate I made at that time, on the best information I could collect, I\r\nsupposed the State of Virginia lost, under Lord Cornwallis' hands, that\r\nyear, about thirty thousand slaves; and that of these, about twenty-seven\r\nthousand died of the small pox and camp fever, and the rest were partly\r\nsent to the West Indies, and exchanged for rum, sugar, coffee and fruit,\r\nand partly sent to New York, from whence they went, at the peace, either\r\nto Nova Scotia or England. From this last place, I believe they have been\r\nlately sent to Africa. History will never relate the horrors committed\r\nby the British army in the _southern_ States of America. They raged\r\nin Virginia six months only, from the middle of April to the middle\r\nof October, 1781, when they were all taken prisoners; and I give you a\r\nfaithful specimen of their transactions for ten days of that time, and\r\non one spot only. _Ex pede Herculem._ I suppose their whole devastations\r\nduring those six months, amounted to about three millions sterling. The\r\ncopiousness of this subject has only left me space to assure you of the\r\nsentiments of esteem and respect, with which I am, Sir, your most obedient\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. IZARD.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, July 17, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR, * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nI cannot but approve your idea of sending your eldest son, destined\r\nfor the law, to Williamsburg. The professor of Mathematics and Natural\r\nPhilosophy there, (Mr. Madison, cousin of him whom you know,) is a man\r\nof great abilities, and their apparatus is a very fine one. Mr. Ballini,\r\nprofessor of Modern Language, is also an excellent one. But the pride of\r\nthe Institution is Mr. Wythe, one of the Chancellors of the State, and\r\nprofessor of law in the College. He is one of the greatest men of the age,\r\nhaving held without competition the first place at the bar of our general\r\ncourt for twenty-five years, and always distinguished by the most spotless\r\nvirtue. He gives lectures regularly, and holds moot courts and parliaments\r\nwherein he presides, and the young men debate regularly in law and\r\nlegislation, learn the rules of parliamentary proceeding, and acquire the\r\nhabit of public speaking. Williamsburg is a remarkably healthy situation,\r\nreasonably cheap, and affords very genteel society. I know no place _in\r\nthe world_, while the _present professors remain_, where I would so soon\r\nplace a son.\r\n\r\nI have made the necessary inquiries relative to a school for your second\r\nson. There are only two here for the line of engineering. I send the\r\nprospectus of the best, which is so particular in its details as to enable\r\nyou to judge for yourself on every point. I will add some observations. I\r\nhave never thought a boy should undertake abstruse or difficult sciences,\r\nsuch as Mathematics in general, till fifteen years of age at soonest.\r\nBefore that time they are best employed in learning the languages which\r\nis merely a matter of memory. The languages are badly taught here.\r\nIf you propose he should learn the Latin, perhaps you will prefer the\r\nhaving him taught it in America, and of course, to retain him there two\r\nor three years more. At that age, he will be less liable to lose his\r\nnative language, and be more able to resist the attempts to change his\r\nreligion. Probably three or four years here would suffice for the theory\r\nof engineering, which would leave him still time enough to see something\r\nof the practice either by land or sea, as he should choose, and to return\r\nhome at a ripe age. Decide on all these points as you think best, and make\r\nwhat use of me in it you please. Whenever you choose to send him, if I am\r\nhere, and you think proper to accept my services towards him, they shall\r\nbe bestowed with the same zeal as if he were my own son.\r\n\r\nThe war in Europe threatens to spread. Sweden, we suppose, has commenced\r\nhostilities against Russia, though we do not yet certainly know it. I\r\nhave hoped this country would settle her internal disputes advantageously\r\nand without bloodshed. As yet none has been spilt, though the British\r\nnewspapers give the idea of a general civil war. Hitherto, I had supposed\r\nboth the King and parliament would lose authority, and the nation gain\r\nit, through the medium of its States General and provincial Assemblies,\r\nbut the arrest of the deputies of Bretagne two days ago, may kindle a\r\ncivil war. Its issue will depend on two questions. 1. Will other provinces\r\nrise? 2. How will the army conduct itself? A stranger cannot predetermine\r\nthese questions. Happy for us that abuses have not yet become patrimonies,\r\nand that every description of interest is in favor of national and\r\nmoderate government. That we are yet able to send our wise and good men\r\ntogether to talk over our form of government, discuss its weaknesses and\r\nestablish its remedies with the same _sang-froid_ as they would a subject\r\nof agriculture. The example we have given to the world is single, that\r\nof changing our form of government under the authority of reason only,\r\nwithout bloodshed.\r\n\r\nI enclose herein a letter from Count Sarsfield to Mrs. Izard, to whom I\r\nbeg to present my respects. I am, with great sincerity, dear Sir, your\r\nfriend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON, OF WILLIAM AND MARY COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, July 19, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My last letter to you was of the 13th of August last. As\r\nyou seem willing to accept of the crumbs of science on which we are\r\nsubsisting here, it is with pleasure I continue to hand them on to you,\r\nin proportion as they are dealt out. Herschel's volcano in the moon\r\nyou have doubtless heard of, and placed among the other vagaries of a\r\nhead, which seems not organized for sound induction. The wildness of\r\nthe theories hitherto proposed by him, on his own discoveries, seems\r\nto authorize us to consider his merit as that of a good optician only.\r\nYou know also, that Dr. Ingenhouse had discovered, as he supposed, from\r\nexperiment, that vegetation might be promoted by occasioning streams of\r\nthe electrical fluid to pass through a plant, and that other physicians\r\nhad received and confirmed this theory. He now, however, retracts it,\r\nand finds by more decisive experiments, that the electrical fluid can\r\nneither forward nor retard vegetation. Uncorrected still of the rage of\r\ndrawing general conclusions from partial and equivocal observations, he\r\nhazards the opinion that _light_ promotes vegetation. I have heretofore\r\nsupposed from observation, that light effects the color of living bodies,\r\nwhether vegetable or animal; but that either the one or the other receives\r\n_nutriment_ from that fluid, must be permitted to be doubted of, till\r\nbetter confirmed by observation. It is always better to have no ideas,\r\nthan false ones; to believe nothing, than to believe what is wrong. In my\r\nmind, theories are more easily demolished than rebuilt.\r\n\r\nAn Abbé here has shaken, if not destroyed, the theory of de Dominis,\r\nDescartes and Newton, for explaining the phenomenon of the rainbow.\r\nAccording to that theory, you know, a cone of rays issuing from the sun,\r\nand falling on a cloud in the opposite part of the heavens, is reflected\r\nback in the form of a smaller cone, the apex of which is the eye of the\r\nobserver; so that the eye of the observer must be in the axis of both\r\ncones, and equally distant from every part of the bow. But he observes,\r\nthat he has repeatedly seen bows, the one end of which has been very near\r\nto him, and the other at a very great distance. I have often seen the\r\nsame thing myself. I recollect well to have seen the end of a rainbow\r\nbetween myself and a house, or between myself and a bank, not twenty yards\r\ndistant; and this repeatedly. But I never saw, what he says he has seen,\r\ndifferent rainbows at the same time intersecting each other. I never saw\r\ncoexistent bows, which were not concentric also. Again, according to the\r\ntheory, if the sun is in the horizon, the horizon intercepts the lower\r\nhalf of the bow, if above the horizon, that intercepts more than the half,\r\nin proportion. So that generally, the bow is less than a semi-circle, and\r\nnever more. He says he has seen it more than a semi-circle. I have often\r\nseen the leg of the bow below my level. My situation at Monticello admits\r\nthis, because there is a mountain there in the opposite direction of the\r\nafternoon's sun, the valley between which and Monticello, is five hundred\r\nfeet deep. I have seen a leg of a rainbow plunge down on the river running\r\nthrough the valley. But I do not recollect to have remarked at any time,\r\nthat the bow was more than half a circle. It appears to me, that these\r\nfacts demolish the Newtonian hypothesis, but they do not support that\r\nerected in its stead by the Abbé. He supposes a cloud between the sun\r\nand the observer, and that through some opening in that cloud, the rays\r\npass, and form an iris on the opposite part of the heavens, just as a ray\r\npassing through a hole in the shutter of a darkened room, and falling on a\r\nprism there, forms the prismatic colors on the opposite wall. According to\r\nthis, we might see bows of more than the half circle, as often as of less.\r\nA thousand other objections occur to this hypothesis, which need not be\r\nsuggested to you. The result is, that we are wiser than we were, by having\r\nan error the less in our catalogue; but the blank occasioned by it, must\r\nremain for some happier hypothesist to fill up.\r\n\r\nThe dispute about the conversion and re-conversion of water and air, is\r\nstill stoutly kept up. The contradictory experiments of chemists, leave\r\nus at liberty to conclude what we please. My conclusion is, that art has\r\nnot yet invented sufficient aids, to enable such subtle bodies to make a\r\nwell-defined impression on organs as blunt as ours; that it is laudable\r\nto encourage investigation, but to hold back conclusion. Speaking one\r\nday with Monsieur de Buffon, on the present ardor of chemical inquiry,\r\nhe affected to consider chemistry but as cookery, and to place the toils\r\nof the laboratory on a footing with those of the kitchen. I think it,\r\non the contrary, among the most useful of sciences, and big with future\r\ndiscoveries for the utility and safety of the human race. It is yet,\r\nindeed, a mere embryon. Its principles are contested; experiments seem\r\ncontradictory; their subjects are so minute as to escape our senses; and\r\ntheir result too fallacious to satisfy the mind. It is probably an age too\r\nsoon, to propose the establishment of a system. The attempt, therefore,\r\nof Lavoisier to reform the chemical nomenclature, is premature. One single\r\nexperiment may destroy the whole filiation of his terms, and his string of\r\nsulphates, sulphites, and sulphures, may have served no other end, than to\r\nhave retarded the progress of the science, by a jargon, from the confusion\r\nof which, time will be requisite to extricate us. Accordingly, it is not\r\nlikely to be admitted generally.\r\n\r\nYou are acquainted with the properties of the composition of nitre, salt\r\nof tartar and sulphur, called pulvis fulminans. Of this, the explosion\r\nis produced by heat alone. Monsieur Bertholet, by dissolving silver\r\nin the nitrous acid, precipitating it with lime water, and drying the\r\nprecipitate on ammoniac, has discovered a powder which fulminates most\r\npowerfully, on coming into contact with any substance however. Once made,\r\nit cannot be touched. It cannot be put into a bottle, but must remain in\r\nthe capsule, where dried. The property of the spathic acid, to corrode\r\nflinty substances, has been lately applied by a Mr. Puymaurin, to engrave\r\non glass, as artists engrave on copper, with aquafortis. M. de La Place\r\nhas discovered, that the secular acceleration and retardation of the\r\nmoon's motion, is occasioned by the action of the sun, in proportion as\r\nhis eccentricity changes, or, in other words, as the orbit of the earth\r\nincreases or diminishes. So that this irregularity is now perfectly\r\ncalculable.\r\n\r\nHaving seen announced in a gazette, that some person had found in a\r\nlibrary of Sicily, an Arabic translation of Livy, which was thought to\r\nbe complete, I got the chargé des affaires of Naples here, to write to\r\nNaples to inquire into the fact. He obtained in answer, that an Arabic\r\ntranslation was found, and that it would restore to us seventeen of the\r\nbooks lost, to wit, from the sixtieth to the seventy-seventh, inclusive:\r\nthat it was in possession of an Abbé Vella, who, as soon as he shall have\r\nfinished a work he has on hand, will give us an Italian, and perhaps a\r\nLatin translation of this Livy. There are persons, however, who doubt\r\nthe truth of this discovery, founding their doubts on some personal\r\ncircumstances relating to the person who says he has this translation.\r\nI find, nevertheless, that the chargé des affaires believes in the\r\ndiscovery, which makes me hope it may be true.\r\n\r\nA countryman of ours, a Mr. Ledyard of Connecticut, set out from hence\r\nsome time ago for St. Petersburg, to go thence to Kamtschatka, thence\r\nto cross over to the western coast of America, and penetrate through the\r\ncontinent, to the other side of it. He had got within a few days' journey\r\nof Kamtschatka, when he was arrested by order of the Empress of Russia,\r\nsent back, and turned adrift in Poland. He went to London; engaged under\r\nthe auspices of a private society, formed there for pushing discoveries\r\ninto Africa; passed by this place, which he left a few days ago for\r\nMarseilles, where he will embark for Alexandria and Grand Cairo; thence\r\nexplore the Nile to its source; cross the head of the Niger, and descend\r\nthat to its mouth. He promises me, if he escapes through his journey, he\r\nwill go to Kentucky, and endeavor to penetrate westwardly to the South\r\nSea.\r\n\r\nThe death of M. de Buffon you have heard long ago. I do not know whether\r\nwe shall have anything posthumous of his. As to political news, this\r\ncountry is making its way to a good constitution. The only danger is, they\r\nmay press so fast as to produce an appeal to arms, which might have an\r\nunfavorable issue for them. As yet, the appeal is not made. Perhaps the\r\nwar which seems to be spreading from nation to nation, may reach them;\r\nthis would ensure the calling of the States General, and this, as is\r\nsupposed, the establishment of a constitution.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of sincere esteem and respect,\r\ndear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. RUTLEDGE.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, July 18, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Messrs. Berard were to have given me particular accounts of the\r\nproceeds of the shipments of rice made to them. But they have failed. I\r\nfear, from what they mention, that the price has been less advantageous\r\nthan usual; which is unlucky, as it falls on the first essay. If on the\r\nwhole, however, you get as much as you would have done by a sale on the\r\nspot, it should encourage other adventures, because the price at Havre or\r\nRouen is commonly higher, and because I think you may, by trials, find out\r\nthe way to avail yourselves of the Paris retail price. The Carolina rice\r\nsold at Paris, is separated into three kinds: 1, the whole grains; 2, the\r\nbroken grains; 3, the small stuff; and sell at ten, eight, and six livres\r\nthe French pound, retail. The whole grains, which constitute the first\r\nquality, are picked out by hand. I would not recommend this operation to\r\nbe done with you, because labor is dearer there than here. But I mention\r\nthese prices, to show, that after making a reasonable deduction for\r\nsorting, and leaving a reasonable profit to the retailer, there should\r\nstill remain a great wholesale price. I shall wish to know from you, how\r\nmuch your cargo of rice shipped to Berard netts you, and how much it would\r\nhave netted in _hard money_, if you had sold it at home.\r\n\r\nYou promise, in your letter of October the 23d, 1787, to give me in your\r\nnext, at large, the conjectures of your philosopher on the descent of the\r\nCreek Indians from the Carthaginians, supposed to have been separated from\r\nHanno's fleet, during his periplus. I shall be very glad to receive them,\r\nand see nothing impossible in his conjecture. I am glad he means to appeal\r\nto similarity of language, which I consider as the strongest kind of proof\r\nit is possible to adduce. I have somewhere read, that the language of the\r\nancient Carthaginians is still spoken by their descendants, inhabiting\r\nthe mountainous interior parts of Barbary, to which they were obliged to\r\nretire by the conquering Arabs. If so, a vocabulary of their tongue can\r\nstill be got, and if your friend will get one of the Creek languages,\r\nthe comparison will decide. He probably may have made progress in this\r\nbusiness; but if he wishes any enquiries to be made on this side the\r\nAtlantic, I offer him my services cheerfully; my wish being like his, to\r\nascertain the history of the American aborigines.\r\n\r\nI congratulate you on the accession of your State to the new federal\r\nconstitution. This is the last I have yet heard of, but I expect daily\r\nto hear that my own has followed the good example, and suppose it to be\r\nalready established. Our government wanted bracing. Still, we must take\r\ncare not to run from one extreme to another; not to brace too high. I\r\nown, I join those in opinion, who think a bill of rights necessary. I\r\napprehend too, that the total abandonment of the principle of rotation in\r\nthe offices of President and Senator, will end in abuse. But my confidence\r\nis, that there will, for a long time, be virtue and good sense enough\r\nin our countrymen, to correct abuses. We can surely boast of having set\r\nthe world a beautiful example of a government reformed by reason alone,\r\nwithout bloodshed. But the world is too far oppressed, to profit by\r\nthe example. On this side of the Atlantic, the blood of the people is\r\nbecome an inheritance, and those who fatten on it, will not relinquish it\r\neasily. The struggle in this country is, as yet, of doubtful issue. It\r\nis, in fact, between the monarchy and the parliaments. The nation is no\r\notherwise concerned, but as both parties may be induced to let go some of\r\nits abuses, to court the public favor. The danger is, that the people,\r\ndeceived by a false cry of liberty, may be led to take side with one\r\nparty, and thus give the other a pretext for crushing them still more. If\r\nthey can avoid the appeal to arms, the nation will be sure to gain much\r\nby this controversy. But if that appeal is made, it will depend entirely\r\non the disposition of the army, whether it issue in liberty or despotism.\r\nThose dispositions are not as yet known. In the meantime, there is great\r\nprobability that the war kindled in the east, will spread from nation to\r\nnation, and in the long run, become general.\r\n\r\nI am, with the most sincere esteem and attachment, my dear Sir, your\r\nfriend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CUTTING.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, July 24, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am indebted to your favor of the 11th instant for many\r\ndetails which I have not received otherwise. Not-withstanding a most\r\nextensive and laborious correspondence which I keep up with my friends\r\non the other side the water, my information is slow, precarious and\r\nimperfect. The New York papers, which I receive regularly, and one or two\r\ncorrespondents in Congress, are my best sources. As you are desirous of\r\nhaving, before your departure for South Carolina, a sketch of European\r\naffairs, as they are seen from this position, I will give you the best I\r\ncan, taking no notice of the \"_bruit de Paris_,\" which, like the English\r\nnewspapers, are but guesses, and made generally by persons who do not give\r\nthemselves the trouble of trying to guess right. I will confine myself\r\nto facts, or well-founded probabilities, and among these must necessarily\r\nrepeat a great deal of what you know already. Perhaps all may be of that\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nThe war undertaken by the Turks, unadvisedly, as was conjectured, has\r\nbeen attended with successes which are now hastening the public opinion to\r\nthe other extreme; but it should be considered that they have been small\r\nsuccesses only, in the partizan way. The probable event of the war can\r\nonly be calculated after a great general action, because it is in that\r\nwe shall see whether the European discipline has been overrated, and the\r\nwant of it in the Turks exaggerated. Russia certainly undertook the war\r\nunwillingly, and the Emperor, it is thought, would now be glad to get out\r\nof it, but the Turks, who demanded a restitution of the Crimea, before\r\nthey began the war, are not likely to recede from that demand, after the\r\nsuccesses they have obtained, nor can Russia yield to it without some\r\nmore decisive event than has yet taken place. A small affair on the Black\r\nSea, which is believed, though not on grounds absolutely authentic, is\r\ncalculated to revive her spirits. Twenty-seven gun boats, Russian, have\r\nobliged fifty-seven, commanded by the Captain Pacha himself, to retire\r\nafter an obstinate action. The Russians were commanded by the Prince of\r\nNassau, with whom our Paul Jones acted as volunteer, and probably directed\r\nthe whole business. I suppose he must have been just arrived, and that his\r\ncommand has not yet been made up. He is to be rear-admiral, and always to\r\nhave a separate command. What the English newspapers said of remonstrances\r\nagainst his being received into the service, as far as I can learn from\r\nthose who would have known it, and would have told it to me, was false,\r\nas is everything those papers say, ever did say, and ever will say. The\r\nprobability, and almost certainty, that Sweden will take a part in the\r\nwar, adds immensely to the embarrassments of Russia, and will almost\r\ncertainly prevent her fleet going to the Mediterranean. It is tolerably\r\ncertain that she has been excited to this by the Court of London, and\r\nthat she has received, through their negotiations, a large subsidy from\r\nthe Turks (about three millions of thalers), yet the meeting of the two\r\nfleets, and their saluting, instead of fighting each other, induces a\r\nsuspicion that if he can hinder the Russian expedition by hectoring only,\r\nhe may not mean to do more. Should this power really engage in the war,\r\nand should it at length spread to France and England, I shall view the\r\nSwedish separation from France as the event which alone decides that\r\nthe late subversion of the European system will be ultimately serious to\r\nFrance. This power, with the two empires, and Spain, was more than a match\r\nfor England, Prussia and Holland by land, and balanced them by sea. For on\r\nthis element France and Spain are equal to England, and Russia to Holland.\r\nSweden was always supposed on the side of France, and to balance Denmark,\r\non the side of England, by land and sea; but if she goes over decidedly\r\ninto the English scale, the balance at sea will be destroyed by the amount\r\nof the whole force of these two powers, who can equip upwards of sixty\r\nsail of the line. There is a report, credited by judicious persons, that\r\nthe Dutch patriots, before their suppression, foreseeing that event, sent\r\norders to the East Indies to deliver Trincomale to the French, and that it\r\nhas been done. My opinion is, either that this is not true, or that they\r\nwill re-deliver it, and disavow their officer who accepted it. If they\r\ndid not think Holland, and all its possessions, worth a war, they cannot\r\nthink a single one of those possessions worth it. M. de St. Priest has\r\nleave to go to the waters. Probably he will then ask and have leave to\r\ncome to Paris, and await events. The English papers have said the works of\r\nCherbourg were destroyed irreparably. This is a mathematical demonstration\r\nthat they are not. The truth is, that the head of one cone has been very\r\nmuch beaten off by the waters. But the happiness of that undertaking is,\r\nthat all its injuries improve it. What is beaten from the head widens the\r\nbase, and fixes the cone much more solidly. That work will be steadily\r\npursued, and, in all human probability, be finally successful. They\r\ncalculate on half a million of livres, say £20,000 sterling, for every\r\ncone, and that there will be from seventy to eighty cones. Probably they\r\nmust make more cones, suppose one hundred, this will be two millions of\r\npounds sterling. Versailles has cost fifty millions of pounds sterling.\r\nOught we to doubt then that they will persevere to the end in a work small\r\nand useful, in proportion as the other was great and foolish?\r\n\r\nThe internal affairs here do not yet clear up. Most of the late\r\ninnovations have been much for the better. Two only must be fundamentally\r\ncondemned; the abolishing, in so great a degree, of the parliaments,\r\nand the substitution of so ill-composed a body as the _cour pleniere_.\r\nIf the King has power to do this, the government of this country is a\r\npure despotism. I think it a pure despotism in theory, but moderated in\r\npractice by the respect which the public opinion commands. But the nation\r\nrepeats, after Montesquieu, that the different bodies of magistracy, of\r\npriests and nobles, are barriers between the King and the people. It would\r\nbe easy to prove that these barriers can only appeal to public opinion,\r\nand that neither these bodies, nor the people, can oppose any legal check\r\nto the will of the monarch. But they are manifestly advancing fast to a\r\nconstitution. Great progress is already made. The provincial assemblies,\r\nwhich will be a very perfect representative of the people, will secure\r\nthem a great deal against the power of the crown. The confession lately\r\nmade by the government, that it cannot impose a new tax, is a great\r\nthing: the convocation of the States General, which cannot be avoided,\r\nwill produce a national assembly, meeting at certain epochs, possessing\r\nat first probably only a negative on the laws, but which will grow into\r\nthe right of original legislation, and prescribing limits to the expenses\r\nof the King. These are improvements which will assuredly take place, and\r\nwhich will give an energy to this country they have never yet had. Much\r\nmay be hoped from the States General, because the King's dispositions are\r\nsolidly good; he is capable of great sacrifices; all he wants to induce\r\nhim to do a thing, is to be assured it will be for the good of the nation.\r\nHe will probably believe what the States General shall tell him, and will\r\ndo it. It is supposed they will reduce the parliament to a mere judiciary.\r\nI am in hopes all this will be effected without convulsions. The English\r\npapers have told the world, with their usual truth, that all here is civil\r\nwar and confusion. There have been some riots, but as yet not a single\r\nlife has been lost, according to the best evidence I have been able to\r\ncollect. One officer was wounded at Grenoble. The arrest of the twelve\r\ndeputies of Bretagne a fortnight ago, I apprehended would have produced\r\nan insurrection; but it seems as if it would not. They have sent eighteen\r\ndeputies more, who will probably be heard. General Armand was one of the\r\ntwelve, and is now in the Bastille. The Marquis de La Fayette, for signing\r\nthe prayer which these deputies were to present, and which was signed\r\nby all the other nobles of Bretagne resident in Paris (about sixty in\r\nnumber), has been disgraced, in the old-fashioned language of the country;\r\nthat is to say, the command in the south of France this summer, which\r\nthey had given him, is taken away. They took all they could from such\r\nothers of the subscribers as held anything from the Court. This dishonors\r\nthem at Court, and in the eyes and conversation of their competitors for\r\npreferment. But it will probably honor them in the eyes of the nation.\r\nThis is as full a detail as I am able to give you of the affairs of\r\nEurope. I have nothing to add to them but my wishes for your health and\r\nhappiness, and assurances of the esteem with which I have the honor to be,\r\ndear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BELLINI.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, July 25, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Though I have written to you seldom, you are often the object\r\nof my thoughts, and always of my affection. The truth is, that the\r\ncircumstances with which I am surrounded, offer little worth detailing to\r\nyou. You are too wise to feel an interest in the squabbles, in which the\r\npride, the dissipations, and the tyranny of kings, keep this hemisphere\r\nconstantly embroiled. Science indeed, finds some aliment here, and you\r\nare one of her sons. But this I have pretty regularly communicated to Mr.\r\nMadison, with whom, I am sure, you participate of it. It is with sincere\r\npleasure I congratulate you on the good fortune of our friend Mazzei, who\r\nis appointed here, to correspond with the King of Poland. The particular\r\ncharacter given him is not well defined, but the salary is, which is more\r\nimportant. It is eight thousand livres a year, which will enable him to\r\nlive comfortably, while his duties will find him that occupation, without\r\nwhich he cannot exist. Whilst this appointment places him at his ease,\r\nit affords him a hope of permanence also. It suspends, if not entirely\r\nprevents, the visit he had intended to his native country, and the return\r\nto his adoptive one, which the death of his wife had rendered possible.\r\nThis last event has given him three quarters of the globe elbow-room,\r\nwhich he had ceded to her, on condition she would leave him quiet in\r\nthe fourth. Their partition of the next world will be more difficult,\r\nif it be divided only into two parts, according to the protestant faith.\r\nHaving seen by a letter you wrote him, that you were in want of a pair of\r\nspectacles, I undertook to procure you some, which I packed in a box of\r\nbooks addressed to Mr. Wythe, and of which I beg your acceptance. This box\r\nlay forgotten at Havre the whole of the last winter, but was at length\r\nshipped, and I trust has come to hand. I packed with the spectacles,\r\nthree or four pair of glasses, adapted to the different periods of life,\r\ndistinguished from each other by numbers, and easily changed. You see\r\nI am looking forward in hope of a long life for you; and that it may\r\nbe long enough to carry you through the whole succession of glasses, is\r\nmy sincere prayer. Present me respectfully to Mrs. Bellini, assure her\r\nof my affectionate remembrance of her, and my wishes for her health and\r\nhappiness; and accept yourself, very sincere professions of the esteem\r\nand attachment with which I am, dear Sir, your affectionate friend and\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CUTTING.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, July 28, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--When I had the honor of writing you on the 24th instant, the\r\ntransactions on the Black Sea were but vaguely known; I am now able to\r\ngive them to you on better foundation. The Captain Pacha was proceeding\r\nwith succors to Ocrakoff, as is said by some (for this fact does not come\r\non the same authority with the others), the authentic account placing the\r\ntwo fleets in the neighborhood of each other at the mouth of the Liman,\r\nwithout saying how they came there. The Captain Pacha, with fifty-seven\r\ngun-boats, attacked the Russian vessels of the same kind, twenty-seven in\r\nnumber, the right wing of which was commanded by Admiral Paul Jones, the\r\nleft by the Prince of Nassau. After an obstinate engagement of five hours,\r\nduring which the Captain Pacha flew incessantly wherever there was danger\r\nor distress, he was obliged to retire, having lost three of his vessels,\r\nand killed only eight men of the Russians. I take this account from the\r\nreport of the action by the Prince of Nassau, which the Russian minister\r\nhere showed me. It is said in other accounts, that all the balls of the\r\nTurks passed overhead, which was the reason they did so little execution.\r\nThis was on the 10th of June, and was the forerunner of the great and\r\ndecisive action between the two main fleets, which took place on the 26th,\r\nthe Russian fleet, commanded by Admiral Paul Jones, the Turkish by Captain\r\nPacha, of which the result only, and not the details, are given us. This\r\nwas, that the vessels of the Turkish Admiral and Vice-Admiral, and four\r\nothers, were burnt, that is to say, six in all, two others were taken, and\r\nbetween three and four thousand prisoners. The Captain Pacha's flag was\r\ntaken, and himself obliged to fly in a small vessel, his whole fleet being\r\ndispersed. The Prince Potemkin immediately got under march for Ocrakoff,\r\nto take advantage of the consternation into which that place was thrown.\r\nThese facts are written by Prince Potemkin, from his head-quarters, to\r\nPrince Gallitzin, the Russian Ambassador at Vienna, who writes them to\r\ntheir minister here, who showed me the letter. The number of prisoners\r\ntaken, renders it probable that the Captain Pacha was on his way to the\r\nrelief of Ocrakoff with transports, as a less authentic report said he\r\nwas. We are not told authentically what was the force on each side in the\r\nmain action of the 26th, but it is supposed to have been about fifteen\r\nships of the line on each side, besides their smaller vessels; but the\r\nevidence of this is vague, and the less to be relied on, as we have known\r\nthat the Russians were much inferior in numbers to the Turks on that sea.\r\nA war of a less bloody kind is begun between the Pope and the King of\r\nNaples, who has refused this year to pay the annual tribute of the hackney\r\nas an acknowledgment that he holds his kingdom as feudatory of the Pope.\r\nThe latter has declared him to stand deprived of his kingdom, but gives\r\nhim three months to consider of it. We shall see what will be made of\r\nthis farce. I have written this supplement to my other letter, in hopes it\r\nmay still find you at London. I am, with much esteem, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. LIMOZIN.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, July 30, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I know nothing myself of the person who was the subject of your\r\nletter of the 27th, except a mere slight personal acquaintance. But I\r\nhave been told that he has been very unsuccessful in commerce, and that\r\nhis affairs are very much deranged. I own I wish to see the beef-trade\r\nwith America taken up by solid hands, because it will give new life to\r\nour Northern States. In general, they do not know how to cure it. But some\r\npersons of Massachusetts have not very long ago brought over packers and\r\npicklers from Ireland, and the beef cured and packed by them has been sent\r\nto the East Indies and brought back again, and perfectly sound. We may\r\nexpect the art will spread. Is the Irish beef as good as that of Hamburg?\r\nIf I had supposed Irish beef could have been got at Havre, I would not\r\nhave sent to Hamburg for beef. I suppose that which came for me cannot be\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\nYou have heard of the great naval victory obtained by the Russians under\r\ncommand of Admiral Paul Jones, over the Turks commanded by the Captain\r\nPacha. We cannot see as yet, whether this will hasten peace. The Swedish\r\nfleet having saluted instead of attacking the Russian, makes us suspect\r\nthese movements of the King of Sweden may be a mere piece of hectoring to\r\nfrighten Russia from the purpose of sending her fleet round, if he can\r\ndo it without actually entering into the war. He is paid by the Turks.\r\nNothing else new. I am, Sir, with great esteem, your most obedient, humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, July 31, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My last letters to you were of the 3d and the 25th of May.\r\nYours from Orange, of April the 22d, came to hand on the 10th instant.\r\n\r\nMy letter to Mr. Jay, containing all the public news that is well\r\nauthenticated, I will not repeat it here, but add some details in the\r\nsmaller way, which you may be glad to know. The disgrace of the Marquis\r\nde la Fayette, which at any other period of their history would have had\r\nthe worst consequences for him, will, on the contrary, mark him favorably\r\nto the nation, at present. During the present administration, he can\r\nexpect nothing; but perhaps it may serve him with their successors,\r\nwhenever a change shall take place. No change of the Principal will\r\nprobably take place before the meeting of the States General; though a\r\nchange is to be wished, for his operations do not answer the expectations\r\nformed of him. These had been calculated on his brilliancy in society.\r\nHe is very feebly aided, too. Montmorin is weak, though a most worthy\r\ncharacter. He is indolent and inattentive, too, in the extreme. Luzerne is\r\nconsiderably inferior in abilities to his brother, whom you know. He is\r\na good man, too, but so much out of his element, that he has the air of\r\none _huskanoyed_. The Garde des sceaux is considered as the Principal's\r\nbull dog, braving danger like the animal. His talents do not pass\r\nmediocrity. The Archbishop's brother, and the new minister Villedeuil, and\r\nLambert, have no will of their own. They cannot raise money for the peace\r\nestablishment the next year, without the States General; much less if\r\nthere be war; and their administration will probably end with the States\r\nGeneral.\r\n\r\nLittlepage, who was here as a secret agent for the King of Poland,\r\nrather overreached himself. He wanted more money. The King furnished it,\r\nmore than once. Still he wanted more, and thought to obtain a high bid\r\nby saying he was called for in America, and asking leave to go there.\r\nContrary to his expectation, he received leave; but he went to Warsaw\r\ninstead of America, and from thence to join the[H] * * * * I do not know\r\nthese facts certainly, but recollect them, by putting several things\r\ntogether. The King then sent an ancient secretary here, in whom he had\r\nmuch confidence, to look out for a correspondent, a mere letter writer for\r\nhim. A happy hazard threw Mazzei in his way. He recommended him, and he\r\nis appointed. He has no diplomatic character whatever, but is to receive\r\neight thousand livres a year, as an intelligencer. I hope this employment\r\nmay have some permanence. The danger is, that he will overact his part.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de la Luzerne had been for many years married to his brother's\r\nwife's sister, secretly. She was ugly and deformed, but sensible, amiable,\r\nand rather rich. When he was ambassador to London, with ten thousand\r\nguineas a year, the marriage was avowed, and he relinquished his cross\r\nof Malta, from which he derived a handsome revenue for life, and which\r\nwas very open to advancement. Not long ago, she died. His real affection\r\nfor her, which was great and unfeigned, and perhaps the loss of his order\r\nfor so short-lived a satisfaction, has thrown him almost into a state of\r\ndespondency. He is now here.\r\n\r\nI send you a book of Dupont's, on the subject of the commercial treaty\r\nwith England. Though its general matter may not be interesting, yet\r\nyou will pick up in various parts of it, such excellent principles and\r\nobservations, as will richly repay the trouble of reading it. I send you\r\nalso, two little pamphlets of the Marquis de Condorcet, wherein is the\r\nmost judicious statement I have seen, of the great questions which agitate\r\nthis nation at present. The new regulations present a preponderance\r\nof good over their evil; but they suppose that the King can model the\r\nconstitution at will, or, in other words, that his government is a pure\r\ndespotism. The question then arising is, whether a pure despotism in a\r\nsingle head, or one which is divided among a king, nobles, priesthood, and\r\nnumerous magistracy, is the least bad. I should be puzzled to decide; but\r\nI hope they will have neither, and that they are advancing to a limited,\r\nmoderate government, in which the people will have a good share.\r\n\r\nI sincerely rejoice at the acceptance of our new constitution by nine\r\nStates. It is a good canvass, on which some strokes only want retouching.\r\nWhat these are, I think are sufficiently manifested by the general voice\r\nfrom north to south, which calls for a bill of rights. It seems pretty\r\ngenerally understood, that this should go to juries, habeas corpus,\r\nstanding armies, printing, religion and monopolies. I conceive there may\r\nbe difficulty in finding general modifications of these, suited to the\r\nhabits of all the States. But if such cannot be found, then it is better\r\nto establish trials by jury, the right of habeas corpus, freedom of the\r\npress and freedom of religion, in all cases, and to abolish standing\r\narmies in time of peace, and monopolies in all cases, than not to do it\r\nin any. The few cases wherein these things may do evil, cannot be weighed\r\nagainst the multitude wherein the want of them will do evil. In disputes\r\nbetween a foreigner and a native, a trial by jury may be improper. But if\r\nthis exception cannot be agreed to, the remedy will be to model the jury,\r\nby giving the _mediatas linguæ_, in civil as well as criminal cases. Why\r\nsuspend the habeas corpus in insurrections and rebellions? The parties\r\nwho may be arrested, may be charged instantly with a well defined crime;\r\nof course, the judge will remand them. If the public safety requires that\r\nthe government should have a man imprisoned on less probable testimony, in\r\nthose than in other emergencies, let him be taken and tried, retaken and\r\nretried, while the necessity continues, only giving him redress against\r\nthe government, for damages. Examine the history of England. See how\r\nfew of the cases of the suspension of the habeas corpus law, have been\r\nworthy of that suspension. They have been either real treason, wherein\r\nthe parties might as well have been charged at once, or sham plots, where\r\nit was shameful they should ever have been suspected. Yet for the few\r\ncases wherein the suspension of the habeas corpus has done real good,\r\nthat operation is now become habitual, and the minds of the nation almost\r\nprepared to live under its constant suspension. A declaration, that the\r\nfederal government will never restrain the presses from printing anything\r\nthey please, will not take away the liability of the printers for false\r\nfacts printed. The declaration, that religious faith shall be unpunished,\r\ndoes not give impunity to criminal acts, dictated by religious error. The\r\nsaying there shall be no monopolies, lessens the incitements to ingenuity,\r\nwhich is spurred on by the hope of a monopoly for a limited time, as\r\nof fourteen years; but the benefit of even limited monopolies is too\r\ndoubtful, to be opposed to that of their general suppression. If no check\r\ncan be found to keep the number of standing troops within safe bounds,\r\nwhile they are tolerated as far as necessary abandon them altogether,\r\ndiscipline well the militia, and guard the magazines with them. More\r\nthan magazine guards will be useless, if few, and dangerous, if many. No\r\nEuropean nation can ever send against us such a regular army as we need\r\nfear, and it is hard, if our militia are not equal to those of Canada or\r\nFlorida. My idea then, is, that though proper exceptions to these general\r\nrules are desirable, and probably practicable, yet if the exceptions\r\ncannot be agreed on, the establishment of the rules, in all cases, will\r\ndo ill in very few. I hope, therefore, a bill of rights will be formed,\r\nto guard the people against the federal government, as they are already\r\nguarded against their State governments, in most instances. The abandoning\r\nthe principle of necessary rotation in the Senate, has, I see, been\r\ndisapproved by many; in the case of the President, by none. I readily,\r\ntherefore, suppose my opinion wrong, when opposed by the majority, as in\r\nthe former instance, and the totality, as in the latter. In this, however,\r\nI should have done it with more complete satisfaction, had we all judged\r\nfrom the same position.\r\n\r\nSolicitations, which cannot be directly refused, oblige me to trouble you\r\noften, with letters recommending and introducing to you, persons who go\r\nfrom hence to America. I will beg the favor of you, to distinguish the\r\nletters wherein I appeal to recommendations from other persons, from those\r\nwhich I write on my own knowledge. In the former, it is never my intention\r\nto compromit myself or you. In both instances, I must beg you to ascribe\r\nthe trouble I give you, to circumstances which do not leave me at liberty\r\nto decline it. I am, with very sincere esteem, dear Sir, your affectionate\r\nfriend and servant.\r\n\r\n    [H] [Several paragraphs of this letter are in cipher. A few words\r\n    here could not be deciphered.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL W. S. SMITH.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, August 2, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR, * * * * *\r\n\r\nYou arrived just in time to see the commencement of a new order of things.\r\nOur political machine is now pretty well wound up; but are the spirits\r\nof our people sufficiently wound down to let it work glibly? I trust it\r\nis too soon for that, and that we have many centuries to come yet before\r\nmy countrymen cease to bear their government hard in hand. This nation\r\nis rising from the dust. They have obtained as you know, provincial\r\nassemblies, in which there will be a more perfect representation of the\r\npeople than in our State assemblies; they have obtained from the King a\r\ndeclaration that he cannot impose a new tax without the consent of the\r\nStates General, and a promise to call the States General. When these meet,\r\nthey will endeavor to establish a declaration of rights, a periodical\r\nnational assembly, and a civil list. I am in hopes that even a war will\r\nnot interrupt this work. Whether, or rather when, this will come upon\r\nthem, is still uncertain. I do not think the present ill humor between\r\nthem and England can be cleared up but by a war, and that it is not very\r\ndistant. England, Holland and Prussia, have now settled their alliance.\r\nSweden has shown dispositions to take side with the Turks, and both, in\r\nthe event of a general war, would be in the English scale. The contrary\r\none would be formed by France, Spain, and the two empires. It even seems\r\npossible that Denmark will attach itself to France instead of England,\r\nrather than not be opposed to Russia. The symptoms of this as yet,\r\nhowever, are slight. The victory lately obtained by our Admiral Paul Jones\r\nover the Captain Pacha, will produce a great effect on the Turkish war. He\r\nburnt six of his vessels, among which was that of the Captain Pacha, and\r\nthat also of his vice-Admiral, took two, and made between three and four\r\nthousand prisoners, and this with a much inferior force. It was the effect\r\nof a gross error in the Captain Pacha, instantaneously and dexterously\r\ntaken advantage of by Paul Jones, who hemmed them up in the swash at\r\nthe mouth of the Boristhenes, so that their vessels buried themselves\r\nin the mud, where they were burnt. The Captain Pacha escaped in a small\r\nvessel. His flag fell into the hands of the Russians. Let me hear from you\r\nsometimes, assured I shall always be interested in your success. Present\r\nme in the most friendly terms to Mrs. Smith, and accept the best affection\r\nof, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. August 6th. Later accounts of the actions between the Russians and\r\nTurks, informs us that Paul Jones commanded the right wing of the little\r\nfleet of gallies, &c., in the first action, which was not at all decisive,\r\nbut that when the second and decisive action took place, which was still\r\nby the gallies, &c., the Prince of Nassau alone commanded, Paul Jones\r\nbeing absent with the ships of war which he commands.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. ADAMS, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, August 2, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have received with a great deal of pleasure the account\r\nof your safe arrival and joyful reception at Boston. Mr. Cutting was\r\nso kind as to send me a copy of the address of the Assembly to you and\r\nyour answer, which, with the other circumstances, I have sent to have\r\npublished in the gazettes of Leyden, and in a gazette here. It will serve\r\nto show the people of Europe that those of America are content with their\r\nservants, and particularly content with you.\r\n\r\nThe war with the Turks, Russians, and Austrians, goes on. A great victory\r\nobtained on the Black Sea over the Turks, as commanded by the Captain\r\nPacha, by the Russians, commanded by Admiral Paul Jones, will serve to\r\nraise the spirits of the two empires. He burnt six ships, among which was\r\nthe admiral's and vice-admiral's, took two, and made between three and\r\nfour thousand prisoners. The Swedes having hastily armed a fleet of about\r\nsixteen sail of the line, and marched an army into Finland, the King at\r\nthe head of it, made us believe they were going to attack the Russians.\r\nBut when their fleet met with three Russian ships of one hundred guns\r\neach, they saluted and passed them. It is pretty well understood that the\r\nexpenses of this armament are paid by the Turks, through the negotiations\r\nof England. And it would seem as if the King had hired himself to\r\nstrut only; but not to fight, expecting probably that the former would\r\nsuffice to divert the Russians from sending their fleet round to the\r\nMediterranean. There are some late symptoms which would indicate that\r\nDenmark would still be opposed to Sweden, though she should shift herself\r\ninto the opposite scale. The alliance between England, Holland and Russia,\r\nis now settled. In the meantime, this country is losing all its allies one\r\nby one, without assuring to herself new ones. Prussia, Holland, Turkey,\r\nSweden, are pretty certainly got, or getting into the English interest,\r\nand the alliance of France with the two empires is not yet secured. I am\r\nin hopes her internal affairs will be arranged without blood. None has\r\nbeen shed as yet. The nation presses on sufficiently upon the government\r\nto force reformations, without forcing them to draw the sword. If they\r\ncan keep the opposition always exactly at this point all will end well.\r\nPeace or war, they cannot fail now to have the States General, and I\r\nthink in the course of the following year. They have already obtained\r\nthe provincial Assemblies as you know. The King has solemnly confessed\r\nhe cannot lay a new tax without consent of the States General, and when\r\nthese assemble they will try to have themselves moulded into a periodical\r\nassembly, to form a declaration of rights, and a civil list for the\r\ngovernment. The Baron de Breteuil has lately retired from the ministry,\r\nand has been succeeded by M. de Villedeuil. Monsieur de Malesherbes will\r\nprobably retire. The Marquis de La Fayette, with several others, have\r\nlately received a fillip for having assembled to sign a memorial to the\r\nKing, which had been sent up from Brittany. They took from the Marquis\r\na particular command which he was to have exercised during the months of\r\nAugust and September this year in the south of France. Your friends the\r\nAbbés are well, and always inquire after you. I shall be happy to hear\r\nfrom you from time to time, to learn State news and State politics, for\r\nwhich I will give you in return those of this quarter of the earth. I hope\r\nMrs. Adams is well; I am sure she is happier in her own country than any\r\nother. Assure her of my constant friendship, and accept assurances of the\r\nsame from, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. Make freely any use of me here which may be convenient either for\r\nyourself or Mrs. Adams.\r\n\r\nP. S. August 6. Later accounts inform us that there have been two actions\r\nbetween the Russians and Turks. The first was of the gallies on both\r\nsides. In this, Paul Jones being accidentally present, commanded the\r\nright wing. The Russians repulsed the Turks. The second action was of the\r\nRussian gallies against the Turkish ships of war. The effect was what is\r\nstated in the preceding letter. But the command was solely in the Prince\r\nof Nassau. Paul Jones with his fleet of ships of war being absent, Prince\r\nPotemkin immediately got under march for Oczakow, to take advantage of the\r\nconsternation it was thrown into. The Swedes have commenced hostilities\r\nagainst the Russians, and war against them is consequently declared by the\r\nEmpress.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, August 3, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--My last letters to you were of the 4th and 23d of May, with a\r\npostscript of the 27th. Since that, I have been honored with yours of\r\nApril the 24th, May the 16th and June the 9th.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable internal occurrences since my last, are these. The\r\nNoblesse of Bretagne, who had received with so much warmth the late\r\ninnovations in the government, assembled, and drew up a memorial to the\r\nKing, and chose twelve members of their body to come and present it.\r\nAmong these was the Marquis de La Rouerie, (Colonel Armand.) The King,\r\nconsidering the Noblesse as having no legal right to assemble, declined\r\nreceiving the memorial. The deputies, to give greater weight to it, called\r\na meeting of the landed proprietors of Bretagne, resident at Paris, and\r\nproposed to them to add their signatures. They did so, to the number\r\nof about sixty, of whom the Marquis de La Fayette was one. The twelve\r\ndeputies, for having called this meeting, were immediately sent to the\r\nBastile, where they now are, and the Parisian signers were deprived of\r\nsuch favors as they held of the court. There were only four of them,\r\nhowever, who held anything of that kind. The Marquis de La Fayette was\r\none of these. They had given him a military command, to be exercised in\r\nthe south of France, during the months of August and September, of the\r\npresent year. This they took from him; so that he is disgraced, in the\r\nancient language of the court, but in truth honorably marked in the eyes\r\nof the nation. The ministers are so sensible of this, that they have had,\r\nseparately, private conferences with him, to endeavor, through him, to\r\nkeep things quiet. From the character of the province of Bretagne, it was\r\nmuch apprehended, for some days, that the imprisonment of their deputies\r\nwould have produced an insurrection. But it took another turn. The _Cours\r\nintermediare_ of the province, acknowledged to be a legal body, deputed\r\neighteen members of their body to the King. To these he gave an audience,\r\nand the answer, of which I send you a copy. This is hard enough. Yet I am\r\nin hopes the appeal to the sword will be avoided, and great modifications\r\nin the government be obtained, without bloodshed. As yet, none has\r\nbeen spilt, according to the best evidence I have been able to obtain,\r\nnotwithstanding what the foreign newspapers have said to the contrary.\r\nThe convocation of the States General has now become inevitable. Whenever\r\nthe time shall be announced certainly, it will keep the nation quiet till\r\nthey meet. According to present probabilities, this must be in the course\r\nof the next summer; but to what movements their meeting and measures may\r\ngive occasion, cannot be foreseen. Should a foreign war take place, still\r\nthey must assemble the States General, because they cannot, but by their\r\naid, obtain money to carry it on. Monsieur de Malesherbes will, I believe,\r\nretire from the King's Council. He has been much opposed to the late\r\nacts of authority. The Baron de Breteuil has resigned his secretaryship\r\nof the domestic department; certainly not for the same reasons, as he is\r\nknown to have been of opinion, that the King had compromitted too much of\r\nhis authority. The real reason has probably been an impatience of acting\r\nunder a principal minister. His successor is M. de Villedeuil, lately\r\nComptroller General.\r\n\r\nThe Ambassadors of Tippoo Saib have arrived here. If their mission has\r\nany other object than that of pomp and ceremony, it is not yet made\r\nknown. Though this court has not avowed that they are in possession of\r\nTrincomale, yet the report is believed, and that possession was taken by\r\nGeneral Conway, in consequence of orders given in the moment that they\r\nthought a war certain. The dispute with the States General of the United\r\nNetherlands, on account of the insult to M. de St. Priest, does not tend,\r\nas yet, towards a settlement. He has obtained leave to go to the waters,\r\nand perhaps, from thence he may come to Paris, to await events. Sweden\r\nhas commenced hostilities against Russia, by the taking a little fortress\r\nby land. This having been their intention, it is wonderful that when\r\ntheir fleet lately met three Russian ships of one hundred guns each, they\r\nsaluted instead of taking them. The Empress has declared war against them\r\nin her turn. It is well understood that Sweden is set on by England, and\r\npaid by the Turks. The prospect of Russia has much brightened by some late\r\nsuccesses. Their fleet of galleys and gunboats, twenty-seven in number,\r\nhaving been attacked by fifty-seven Turkish vessels of the same kind,\r\ncommanded by the Captain Pacha, these were repulsed, with the loss of\r\nthree vessels. In the action, which was on the 18th of June, Admiral Paul\r\nJones commanded the right wing of the Russians, and the Prince of Nassau,\r\nthe left. On the 26th of the same month, the Turkish principal fleet, that\r\nis to say, their ships of the line, frigates, &c., having got themselves\r\nnear the swash, at the mouth of the Boristhenes, the Prince of Nassau took\r\nadvantage of their position, attacked them while so engaged in the mud\r\nthat they could not manœuvre, burnt six, among which were the admiral's,\r\nand vice-admiral's, took two, and made between three and four thousand\r\nprisoners. The first reports gave this success to Admiral Paul Jones; but\r\nit is now rendered rather probable that he was not there, as he commands\r\nthe vessels of war which are said not to have been there. It is supposed\r\nthat his presence in the affair of the 18th, was accidental. But if this\r\nsuccess has been so complete as it is represented, the Black Sea must be\r\ntolerably open to the Russians: in which case, we may expect, from what we\r\nknow of that officer, that he will improve to the greatest advantage the\r\nsituation of things on that sea. The Captain Pacha's standard was taken in\r\nthe last action, and himself obliged to make his escape in a small vessel.\r\nPrince Potemkin immediately got under march for Oczakow, to take advantage\r\nof the consternation into which that place was thrown.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish squadron, after cruising off the western isles and Cape St.\r\nVincent, has returned into port.\r\n\r\nA dispute has arisen between the Papal See and the King of Naples, which\r\nmay, in its progress, enable us to estimate what degree of influence that\r\nSee retains at the present day. The kingdom of Naples, at an early period\r\nof its history, became feudatory to the See of Rome, and in acknowledgment\r\nthereof, has annually paid a hackney to the Pope in Rome, to which place\r\nit has always been sent by a splendid embassy. The hackney has been\r\nrefused by the King this year, and the Pope giving him three months to\r\nreturn to obedience, threatens, if he does not, to proceed seriously\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nAbout three weeks ago, a person called on me and informed me that Silas\r\nDeane had taken him in for a sum of one hundred and twenty guineas, and\r\nthat being unable to obtain any other satisfaction, he had laid hands on\r\nhis account book and letter book, and had brought them off to Paris, to\r\noffer them first to the United States, if they would repay him his money,\r\nand if not, that he should return to London, and offer them to the British\r\nminister. I desired him to leave them with me four-and-twenty hours, that\r\nI might judge whether they were worth our notice. He did so. They were\r\ntwo volumes. One contained all his accounts with the United States, from\r\nhis first coming to Europe, to January the 10th, 1781. Presuming that\r\nthe treasury board was in possession of this account till his arrival in\r\nPhiladelphia, August, 1778, and that he had never given in the subsequent\r\npart, I had that subsequent part copied from the book, and now enclose it,\r\nas it may, on some occasion or other, perhaps be useful in the treasury\r\noffice. The other volume contained all his correspondences from March\r\nthe 30th to August the 23d, 1777. I had a list of the letters taken, by\r\ntheir dates and addresses, which will enable you to form a general idea\r\nof the collection. On perusal of many of them, I thought it desirable\r\nthat they should not come to the hands of the British minister, and from\r\nan expression dropped by the possessor of them, I believe he would have\r\nfallen to fifty or sixty guineas. I did not think them important enough,\r\nhowever, to justify my purchasing them without authority; though, with\r\nauthority, I should have done it. Indeed, I would have given that sum\r\nto cut out a single sentence, which contained evidence of a fact, not\r\nproper to be committed to the hands of enemies. I told him I would state\r\nhis proposition to you, and await orders. I gave him back the books, and\r\nhe returned to London without making any promise that he would await the\r\nevent of the orders you might think proper to give.\r\n\r\nNews of the accession of nine States to the new form of federal\r\ngovernment, has been received here about a week. I have the honor to\r\ncongratulate you sincerely on this event. Of its effect at home, you are\r\nin the best situation to judge. On this side the Atlantic it is considered\r\nas a very wise reformation. In consequence of this, speculations are\r\nalready begun here, to purchase up our domestic liquidated debt. Indeed,\r\nI suspect that orders may have been previously lodged in America to do\r\nthis, as soon as the new Constitution was accepted effectually. If it is\r\nthought that this debt should be retained at home, there is not a moment\r\nto lose; and I know of no means of retaining it, but those I suggested to\r\nthe treasury board, in my letter to them of March the 29th. The transfer\r\nof these debts to Europe, will exclusively embarrass, and perhaps totally\r\nprevent the borrowing any money in Europe, till these shall be paid off.\r\nThis is a momentous object, and in my opinion should receive instantaneous\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThe gazettes of France, to the departure of my letter, will accompany it,\r\nand those of Leyden to the 22d of July, at which time their distribution\r\nin this country was prohibited. How long the prohibition may continue, I\r\ncannot tell. As far as I can judge, it is the only paper in Europe worth\r\nreading. Since the suppression of the packet boats, I have never been\r\nable to find a safe conveyance for a letter to you, till the present by\r\nMrs. Barclay. Whenever a confidential person shall be going from hence\r\nto London, I shall send my letters for you to the care of Mr. Trumbull,\r\nwho will look out for safe conveyances. This will render the epochs of my\r\nwriting very irregular. There is a proposition under consideration, for\r\nestablishing packet boats on a more economical plan, from Havre to Boston;\r\nbut its success is uncertain, and still more, its duration. I have the\r\nhonor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir,\r\nyour most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, August 9, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Since my last to you, I have to thank you for your favors\r\nof July the 27th, 1787, and April the 10th, 1788, and the details they\r\ncontained; and in return, will give you now the leading circumstances of\r\nthis continent. * * *\r\n\r\nThis nation is, at present, under great internal agitation. The authority\r\nof the crown on one part, and that of the parliaments on the other,\r\nare fairly at issue. Good men take part with neither, but have raised\r\nan opposition, the object of which is, to obtain a fixed and temperate\r\nconstitution. There was a moment, when this opposition ran so high, as to\r\nendanger an appeal to arms, in which case, perhaps, it would have been\r\ncrushed. The moderation of government has avoided this, and they are\r\nyielding daily, one right after another, to the nation. They have given\r\nthem Provincial Assemblies, which will be very perfect representations\r\nof the nation, and stand somewhat in the place of our State Assemblies;\r\nthey have reformed the criminal law; acknowledged the King cannot lay a\r\nnew tax, without the consent of the States General; and they will call\r\nthe States General the next year. The object of this body, when met, will\r\nbe a bill of rights, a civil list, a national assembly meeting at certain\r\nepochs, and some other matters of that kind. So that I think it probable,\r\nthis country will, within two or three years, be in the enjoyment of a\r\ntolerably free constitution, and that without its having cost them a drop\r\nof blood; for none has yet been spilt, though the English papers have set\r\nthe whole nation to cutting throats.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBe assured of those sentiments of esteem and attachment with which I am,\r\ndear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR DE CREVE-COEUR.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, August 9, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--While our second revolution is just brought to a happy end\r\nwith you, yours here is but cleverly under way. For some days, I was\r\nreally melancholy with the apprehension, that arms would be appealed to,\r\nand the opposition crushed in its first efforts. But things seem now to\r\nwear a better aspect. While the opposition keeps at its highest wholesome\r\npoint, government, unwilling to draw the sword, is not forced to do it.\r\nThe contest here is exactly what it was in Holland: a contest between the\r\nmonarchical and aristocratical parts of the government, for a monopoly of\r\ndespotism over the people. The aristocracy in Holland, seeing that their\r\ncommon prey was likely to escape out of their clutches, chose rather to\r\nretain its former portion, and therefore coalesced with the single head.\r\nThe people remained victims. Here, I think, it will take a happier turn.\r\nThe parliamentary part of the aristocracy is alone firmly united. The\r\nNoblesse and Clergy, but especially the former, are divided partly between\r\nthe parliamentary and the despotic party, and partly united with the real\r\npatriots, who are endeavoring to gain for the nation what they can, both\r\nfrom the parliamentary and the single despotism. I think I am not mistaken\r\nin believing that the King and some of his ministers are well affected to\r\nthis band; and surely, that they will make great cessions to the people,\r\nrather than small ones to the parliament. They are, accordingly, yielding\r\ndaily to the national reclamations, and will probably end, in according a\r\nwell-tempered constitution. They promise the States General for the next\r\nyear, and I have good information that an _Arret_ will appear the day\r\nafter to-morrow, announcing them for May, 1789. How they will be composed,\r\nand what they will do, cannot be foreseen. Their convocation, however,\r\nwill tranquillize the public mind, in a great degree, till their meeting.\r\nThere are, however, two intervening difficulties: 1. Justice cannot till\r\nthen continue completely suspended, as it now is. The parliament will not\r\nresume their functions, but in their entire body. The baillages are afraid\r\nto accept of them. What will be done? 2. There are well-founded fears of a\r\nbankruptcy before the month of May. In the meantime, the war is spreading\r\nfrom nation to nation. Sweden has commenced hostilities against Russia;\r\nDenmark is showing its teeth against Sweden; Prussia against Denmark;\r\nand England too deeply engaged in playing the back game, to avoid coming\r\nforward, and dragging this country and Spain in with her. But even war\r\nwill not prevent the assembly of the States General, because it cannot be\r\ncarried on without them. War, however, is not the most favorable moment\r\nfor divesting the monarchy of power. On the contrary, it is the moment\r\nwhen the energy of a single hand shows itself in the most seducing form.\r\n\r\nA very considerable portion of this country has been desolated by a hail.\r\nI considered the newspaper accounts, of hailstones of ten pounds weight,\r\nas exaggerations. But in a conversation with the Duke de La Rochefoucault,\r\nthe other day, he assured me, that though he could not say he had seen\r\nsuch himself, yet he considered the fact as perfectly established. Great\r\ncontributions, public and private, are making for the sufferers. But\r\nthey will be like the drop of water from the finger of Lazarus. There is\r\nno remedy for the present evil, nor way to prevent future ones, but to\r\nbring the people to such a state of ease, as not to be ruined by the loss\r\nof a single crop. This hail may be considered as the _coup de grace_ to\r\nan expiring victim. In the arts, there is nothing new discovered since\r\nyou left us, which is worth communicating. Mr. Payne's iron bridge was\r\nexhibited here, with great approbation. An idea has been encouraged, of\r\nexecuting it in three arches, at the King's garden. But it will probably\r\nnot be done.\r\n\r\nI am, with sentiments of perfect esteem and attachment, dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. BANNISTER, JR., ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, August 9, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,-- * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nThis country at present is extremely agitated by the disputes between the\r\nKing and his parliaments. Between these two parties there is a middle\r\npatriotic one, proceeding with a steady step to recover from both what\r\nthey can for the nation, and I think they will obtain a pretty good\r\nconstitution. It is now pretty certain they will call the States General\r\nthe next year, and probably in the month of May. It is expected that\r\nAssembly will endeavor to fix some certain limits to the royal authority.\r\nThe Swedes have commenced hostilities against the Russians, and obtained\r\na small advantage in an engagement on the Baltic. The Russians have had\r\ntwo considerable actions on the Black Sea with the Turks. The first was\r\nin their favor, the second a complete victory. In the first, Admiral\r\nPaul Jones commanded the right wing. He was not at the second action. He\r\ncommands the ships of war on that sea. Both actions were by the Russian\r\ngallies, commanded by the Prince of Nassau, and Paul Jones seems to have\r\nbeen accidentally present in the first. These victories will probably have\r\na great effect. This country wishes to keep out of the war, but I doubt\r\nthe possibility of it. Your affectionate friend and humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY THE COUNT DE MOUSTIER.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, August 9, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Though your numerous and well-informed correspondents here must\r\nkeep you constantly _au courant_ of what passes in Europe, yet I cannot\r\nrelinquish the privilege of writing to you altogether, merely because\r\nI can tell you nothing but what you learn better from other hands. You\r\nwill have heard of the astonishing revolution in the politics of Sweden,\r\nwhich has lately carried her into the scale favored by England and opposed\r\nto France. Hostilities were commenced by the Swedes, by the attack of a\r\nsmall Russian post. They pretend the Russians had previously entered on\r\ntheir territory and burnt a village or two, but it is believed that this\r\npretended aggression was by Swedes themselves in Cossack dress, to give a\r\ncolor for hostilities where none existed before. It is said, and believed,\r\nthere has been a naval action on the Baltic, wherein the Russians were\r\nobliged to retire, with the loss of two ships. But the latter have been\r\nmore fortunate in two actions against the Turks, on the Black Sea. In the\r\nfirst, they but barely repulsed the Turks, with the loss of three vessels\r\nof the latter. In the second, they obtained a complete and decisive\r\nvictory. I think there is a hope that Denmark will still oppose itself\r\nto Sweden. If so, the balance of naval power will still be preserved in\r\nsome degree; for though Sweden may return to France on a future occasion\r\nif the latter should not be obliged to enter into the present war,\r\nif she does enter into it, I apprehend Sweden will ultimately arrange\r\nherself with the adverse party. And that she must enter into, in the\r\nlong run, I think extremely probable. I sincerely wish this may not be,\r\ntill she shall have arranged her internal affairs. These, in my opinion,\r\nare going on in the fairest way possible to produce good to the body of\r\nthe nation. The progress already made is great, and the cry for further\r\nimprovement, without being strong enough to induce government to draw the\r\nsword and crush the opposition, is strong enough to goad them on towards\r\nthe establishment of a constitution. I think that among the ministers\r\nthemselves there are some good patriots who are not entirely displeased at\r\nthis degree of violence. It is already announced that the States General\r\nwill be called in 1789, and I have tolerably good information that an\r\n_Arret_ will appear the day after to-morrow announcing them for May, 1789;\r\nbut my letters must go off to-morrow, so that this intelligence cannot\r\nbe confirmed in them. You will have heard that the Baron de Breteuil\r\nis retired, and Monsieur de Villedeuil in his place. M. de Malesherbes\r\nhas endeavored to retire, but as yet he is over-powered by strong\r\nintercession. The Marechal de Richelieu died yesterday. The Marechal de\r\nVaux is at the point of death in Dauphine. The Ambassadors of Tippoo Saib\r\nare to be received to-morrow at Versailles in great pomp. I go to see this\r\n_jeu d'enfants_. I wish Madame de Brehan could be there to paint it. By\r\nthis time, I am afraid she is ready to do justice to my information on\r\nthe subject of my own country, that the Cultivateur Americaine had been\r\ntoo much disposed to see the fair side; that it had too sides as well\r\nas all other countries, &c. I beg her indulgence for our foibles, and a\r\ncontinuance particularly of her partiality to me. Be so good as to present\r\nme very affectionately to her, and to be assured of the sincerity of the\r\nesteem and attachment with which I have the honor to be, dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, August 10, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have waited till the last moment of Mrs. Barclay's departure,\r\nto write you the occurrences since my letter of the 3d instant. We have\r\nreceived the Swedish account of an engagement between their fleet and the\r\nRussian, on the Baltic, wherein they say they took one, and burned another\r\nRussian vessel, with the loss of one on their side, and that the victory\r\nremained with them. They say, at the same time, that their fleet returned\r\ninto port, and the Russians kept the sea; we must, therefore, suspend\r\nour opinion, till we get the Russian version of this engagement. The\r\nSwedish manifesto was handed about to-day at Versailles, by the Swedish\r\nambassador, in manuscript. The King complains that Russia has been ever\r\nendeavoring to sow divisions in his kingdom, in order to re-establish the\r\nancient constitution; that he has long borne it, through a love of peace,\r\nbut finds it no longer bearable; that still, however, he will make peace\r\non these conditions: 1, that the Empress punishes her minister for the\r\nnote he gave in to the court of Stockholm; 2, that she restore Crimea to\r\nthe Turks; and 3, that she repay to him all the expenses of his armament.\r\nThe Russian force in vessels of war, on the Black Sea, are five frigates\r\nand three ships of the line; but those of the line are shut up in port,\r\nand cannot come out, till Oczakow shall be taken. This fleet is commanded\r\nby Paul Jones, with the rank of rear-admiral. The Prince of Nassau\r\ncommands the gallies and gun-boats. It is now ascertained that the States\r\nGeneral will assemble the next year, and probably in the month of May.\r\nTippoo Saib's ambassadors had their reception to-day at Versailles, with\r\nunusual pomp. The presence was so numerous, that little could be caught of\r\nwhat they said to the King, and he answered to them; from what little I\r\ncould hear, nothing more passed than mutual assurances of good will. The\r\nname of the Marechal de Richelieu is sufficiently remarkable in history,\r\nto justify my mentioning his death, which happened two days ago: he was\r\naged ninety-two years.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, August 11, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In my letter of the last night, written in the moment of Mrs.\r\nBarclay's departure, I had the honor of mentioning to you, that it was\r\nnow pretty certain that the States General would be assembled in the\r\nnext year, and probably in the month of May. This morning an _Arret_ is\r\npublished, announcing that their meeting is fixed on the first day of\r\nMay next, of which I enclose you a copy by post, in hopes it will get\r\nto Bordeaux in time for Mrs. Barclay. This _Arret_ ought to have a great\r\neffect towards tranquillizing the nation. There are still, however, two\r\ncircumstances which must continue to perplex the administration. The\r\nfirst is, the want of money, occasioned not only by the difficulty of\r\nfilling up the loan of the next year, but by the withholding the ordinary\r\nsupplies of taxes, which is said to have taken place in some instances:\r\nthis gives apprehension of a bankruptcy under some form or other, and\r\nhas occasioned the stocks to fall in the most alarming manner. The\r\nsecond circumstance is, that justice, both civil and criminal, continues\r\nsuspended. The parliament will not resume their functions, but with their\r\nwhole body and the greater part of the baillages declined acting; the\r\npresent _Arret_ announces a perseverance in this plan. I have information\r\nfrom Algiers, of the 5th of June, that the plague is raging there with\r\ngreat violence; that one of our captives was dead of it, and another\r\nill, so that we have there, in all, now, only fifteen or sixteen; that\r\nthe captives are more exposed to its ravages than others; that the great\r\nredemptions by the Spaniards, Portuguese and Neapolitans, and the havoc\r\nmade by the plague, had now left not more than four hundred slaves in\r\nAlgiers; so that their redemption was become not only exorbitant, but\r\nalmost inadmissible; that common sailors were held at four hundred pounds\r\nsterling, and that our fifteen or sixteen could probably not be redeemed\r\nfor less than from twenty-five to thirty thousand dollars. An Algerine\r\ncruiser, having twenty-eight captives of Genoa aboard, was lately chased\r\nashore by two Neapolitan vessels; the crew and captives got safe ashore,\r\nand the latter, of course, recovered their freedom. The Algerine crew was\r\nwell treated, and would be sent back by the French. But the government\r\nof Algiers demands of France sixty thousand sequins, or twenty-seven\r\nthousand pounds sterling, for the captives escaped; that is, nearly\r\none thousand pounds each. The greater part of the regency were for an\r\nimmediate declaration of war against France; but the Dey urged the heavy\r\nwar the Turks were at present engaged in; that it would be better not to\r\ndraw another power on them, at present; that they would decline renewing\r\nthe treaty of one hundred years, which expired two years ago, so as to be\r\nfree to act hereafter; but for the present, they ought to accept payment\r\nfor the captives as a satisfaction. They accordingly declared to the\r\nFrench consul that they would put him and all his countrymen there into\r\nirons, unless the sixty thousand sequins were paid; the consul told them,\r\nhis instructions were, positively, that they should not be paid. In this\r\nsituation stood matters between that pettifogging nest of robbers, and\r\nthis great kingdom, which will finish, probably, by crouching under them,\r\nand paying the sixty thousand sequins. From the personal characters of the\r\npresent administration, I should have hoped, under any other situation\r\nthan the present, they might have ventured to quit the beaten track of\r\npolitics hitherto pursued, in which the honor of their nation has been\r\ncalculated at nought, and to join in a league for keeping up a perpetual\r\ncruise against these pirates, which, though a slow operation, would be\r\na sure one for destroying all their vessels and seamen, and turning the\r\nrest of them to agriculture. But a desire of not bringing upon themselves\r\nanother difficulty, will _probably_ induce the ministers to do as their\r\npredecessors have done.\r\n\r\nAugust 12. The enclosed paper of this morning, gives some particulars of\r\nthe action between the Russians and Swedes, the manifesto of the Empress,\r\nand the declaration of the court of Versailles, as to the affair of\r\nTrincomcale.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of perfect esteem and respect,\r\nSir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, August 12, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Since my last to you, I have been honored with yours of the\r\n18th and 29th of May, and 8th of June. My latest American intelligence is\r\nof the 24th of June, when nine certainly, and probably ten States, had\r\naccepted the new Constitution, and there was no doubt of the eleventh\r\n(North Carolina), because there was no opposition there. In New York,\r\ntwo-thirds of the State were against it, and certainly, if they had been\r\ncalled to the decision in any other stage of the business, they would have\r\nrejected it; but before they put it to the vote, they would certainly\r\nhave heard that eleven States had joined in it, and they would find it\r\nsafer to go with those eleven, than put themselves into opposition, with\r\nRhode Island only. Though I am much pleased with this successful issue of\r\nthe new Constitution, yet I am more so, to find that one of its principal\r\ndefects (the want of a declaration of rights) will pretty certainly be\r\nremedied. I suppose this, because I see that both people and conventions,\r\nin almost every State, have concurred in demanding it. Another defect,\r\nthe perpetual re-eligibility of the same President, will probably not be\r\ncured during the life of General Washington. His merit has blinded our\r\ncountrymen to the danger of making so important an officer re-eligible.\r\nI presume there will not be a vote against him in the United States. It\r\nis more doubtful who will be Vice President. The age of Dr. Franklin,\r\nand the doubt whether he would accept it, are the only circumstances that\r\nadmit a question, but that he would be the man. After these two characters\r\nof first magnitude, there are so many which present themselves equally,\r\non the second line, that we cannot see which of them will be singled\r\nout. John Adams, Hancock, Jay, Madison, Rutledge, will all be voted for.\r\nCongress has acceded to the prayer of Kentucky, to become an independent\r\nmember of the Union. A committee was occupied in settling the plan of\r\nreceiving them, and their government is to commence on the 1st day of\r\nJanuary next.\r\n\r\nYou are, I dare say, pleased, as I am, with the promotion of our\r\ncountryman, Paul Jones. He commanded the right wing, in the first\r\nengagement between the Russian and Turkish gallies; his absence from the\r\nsecond proves his superiority over the Captain Pacha, as he did not choose\r\nto bring his ships into the shoals in which the Pacha ventured, and lost\r\nthose entrusted to him. I consider this officer as the principal hope of\r\nour future efforts on the ocean. You will have heard of the action between\r\nthe Swedes and Russians, on the Baltic; as yet, we have only the Swedish\r\nversion of it. I apprehend this war must catch from nation to nation, till\r\nit becomes general.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the internal affairs of this country, I hope they will be\r\nfinally well arranged, and without having cost a drop of blood. Looking\r\non as a by-stander, no otherwise interested, than as entertaining a\r\nsincere love for the nation in general, and a wish to see their happiness\r\npromoted, keeping myself clear of the particular views and passions of\r\nindividuals, I applaud extremely the patriotic proceedings of the present\r\nministry. Provincial Assemblies established, the States General called,\r\nthe right of taxing the nation without their consent abandoned, corvées\r\nabolished, torture abolished, the criminal code reformed, are facts which\r\nwill do eternal honor to their administration, in history. But were I\r\ntheir historian, I should not equally applaud their total abandonment\r\nof their foreign affairs. A bolder front in the beginning would have\r\nprevented the first loss, and, consequently, all the others. Holland,\r\nPrussia, Turkey and Sweden, lost without the acquisition of a single new\r\nally, are painful reflections for the friends of France. They may, indeed,\r\nhave in their places, the two empires, and perhaps Denmark; in which case,\r\nphysically speaking, they will stand on as good ground as before, but\r\nnot on as good moral ground. Perhaps, seeing more of the internal working\r\nof the machine, they saw, more than we do, the physical impossibility of\r\nhaving money to carry on a war. Their justification must depend on this,\r\nand their atonement, on the internal good they are doing to their country;\r\nthis makes me completely their friend.\r\n\r\nI am, with great esteem and attachment, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. J. RUTLEDGE, JUNIOR.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, August 12, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Obliged to make one letter serve for yourself and Mr. Shippen,\r\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of August the\r\n1st, and his of July the 12th and 31st. By news from Virginia of the 12th\r\nof June, when their convention had been eleven days in session, there was\r\nno doubt but that she, soon after that date, would give the ninth vote\r\nin favor of the new Constitution. New Hampshire acceded to it on the 24th\r\nof June. Of North Carolina no doubt is entertained. Congress have agreed\r\nto the independence of Kentucky. An _Arret_ was published here yesterday\r\nannouncing that the convocation of the States General should be for the\r\n1st of May next, and in the meantime suspending the _cours pleniere_,\r\nbut persevering in the parliamentary reform. This, I think, secures the\r\nreformation of their constitution without bloodshed. You will already have\r\nheard of the commencement of hostilities between Sweden and Russia. This\r\nwar, I think, will catch from nation to nation till it becomes general. I\r\nimagine you will find it unsafe to proceed from Vienna to Constantinople.\r\nI do not think the object will justify any personal risk. Mr. Short is not\r\nyet decided as to his route, or the time of his beginning it. I am, with\r\nvery great esteem, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, August 20, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I had the honor to write to you on the 3d, 10th, and 11th instant,\r\nwith a postscript of the 12th; all of which went by Mrs. Barclay. Since\r\nthat date, we have received an account of a third victory obtained by the\r\nRussians over the Turks, on the Black Sea, in which the Prince of Nassau,\r\nwith his gallies, destroyed two frigates, three smaller vessels, and six\r\ngallies. The Turkish power on that sea, is represented by their enemies\r\nas now annihilated. There is reason to believe, however, that this is not\r\nliterally true, and, that aided by the supplies furnished by the English,\r\nthey are making extraordinary efforts to re-establish their marine. The\r\nRussian minister here has shown the official report of Admiral Greigh, on\r\nthe combat of July the 17th, in which he claims the victory, and urges in\r\nproof of it, that he kept the field of battle. This report is said to have\r\nbeen written on it. As this paper, together with the report of the Swedish\r\nadmiral, is printed in the Leyden gazette of the 15th instant, I enclose\r\nit to you. The court of Denmark has declared, it will furnish Russia the\r\naid stipulated in their treaty; and it is not doubted they will go beyond\r\nthis, and become principals in the war. The next probable moves are,\r\nthat the King of Prussia will succor Sweden; and Poland, Russia, by land;\r\nand a possible consequence is, that England may send a squadron into the\r\nBaltic, to restore equilibrium in that sea. In my letter of the 11th, I\r\nobserved to you, that this country would have two difficulties to struggle\r\nwith, till the meeting of their States General, and that one of these\r\nwas the want of money: this has, in fact, overborne all their resources,\r\nand the day before yesterday they published an _Arret_, suspending all\r\nreimbursements of capital, and reducing the payments of the principal mass\r\nof demands for interest, to twelve sous in the livre; the remaining eight\r\nsous to be paid with certificates. I enclose you a newspaper with the\r\n_Arret_. In this paper, you will see the exchange of yesterday, and I have\r\ninserted that of the day before, to show you the fall. The consternation\r\nis, as yet, too great to let us judge of the issue. It will probably\r\nripen the public mind to the necessity of a change in their constitution,\r\nand to the substituting the collected wisdom of the whole, in place of a\r\nsingle will, by which they have been hitherto governed. It is a remarkable\r\nproof of the total incompetency of a single head to govern a nation well,\r\nwhen, with a revenue of six hundred millions, they are led to a declared\r\nbankruptcy, and to stop the wheels of government, even in its most\r\nessential movements, for want of money.\r\n\r\nI send the present letter by a private conveyance to a sea port, in hopes\r\na conveyance may be found by some merchant vessel.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CUTTING.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, August 23, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have duly received your favors of the 3d, 8th, 14th and 15th\r\ninstant, and have now the honor of enclosing you a letter of introduction\r\nto Doctor Ramsay.\r\n\r\nI think a certainty that England and France must enter into the war,\r\nwas a great inducement to the ministry here, to suspend the portion of\r\npublic payments which they have lately suspended. By this operation,\r\nthey secure two hundred and three millions of livres, or eight millions\r\nand a half of guineas, in the course of this and the ensuing year, which\r\nwill be sufficient for the campaign of the first year: for what is to\r\nfollow, the States General must provide. The interesting question now\r\nis, how the States General shall be composed? There are three opinions.\r\n1. To place the three estates, Clergy, Noblesse, and Commons, in three\r\ndifferent Houses. The Clergy would, probably, like this, and some of the\r\nNobility; but it has no partisans out of those orders. 2. To put the\r\nClergy and Noblesse into one House, and the Commons into another. The\r\nNoblesse will be generally for this. 3. To put the three orders into one\r\nHouse, and make the Commons the majority of that House. This re-unites\r\nthe greatest number of partisans, and I suspect it is well patronised in\r\nthe ministry, who, I am persuaded, are proceeding _bonâ fide_, to improve\r\nthe constitution of their country. As to the opposition which the English\r\nexpect from the personal character of the King, it proves they do not know\r\nwhat his personal character is. He is the honestest man in his kingdom,\r\nand the most regular and economical. He has no foible which will enlist\r\nhim against the good of his people; and whatever constitution will promote\r\nthis, he will befriend. But he will not befriend it obstinately: he has\r\ngiven repeated proofs of a readiness to sacrifice his opinion to the\r\nwish of the nation. I believe he will consider the opinion of the States\r\nGeneral, as the best evidence of what will please and profit the nation,\r\nand will conform to it. All the characters at court may not be of this\r\ndisposition, and from thence may, possibly, arise representations, capable\r\nof leading the King astray; but upon a full view of all circumstances, I\r\nhave sanguine hopes, that such a constitution will be established here, as\r\nwill regenerate the energy of the nation, cover its friends, and make its\r\nenemies tremble. I am, with very great esteem, dear Sir, your friend and\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, September 3, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--By Mrs. Barclay I had the honor of sending you letters of the 3d,\r\n10th and 11th of August: since which, I wrote you of the 20th of the same\r\nmonth, by a casual conveyance, as is the present.\r\n\r\nIn my letter of the 20th, I informed you of the act of public bankruptcy\r\nwhich had taken place here. The effect of this would have been a forced\r\nloan of about one hundred and eighty millions of livres, in the course\r\nof the present and ensuing year. But it did not yield a sufficient\r\nimmediate relief. The treasury became literally moneyless, and all\r\npurposes depending on this mover, came to a stand. The Archbishop was\r\nhereupon removed, with Monsieur Lambert, the Comptroller General; and Mr.\r\nNeckar was called in, as Director General of the finance. To soften the\r\nArchbishop's dismission, a cardinal's hat is asked for him from Rome,\r\nand his nephew promised the succession to the Archbishopric of Sens.\r\nThe public joy, on this change of administration, was very great indeed.\r\nThe people of Paris were amusing themselves with trying and burning the\r\nArchbishop in effigy, and rejoicing on the appointment of Mr. Neckar.\r\nThe commanding officer of the city guards undertook to forbid this, and\r\nnot being obeyed, he charged the mob with fixed bayonets, killed two or\r\nthree, and wounded many: this stopped their rejoicings for that day; but\r\nenraged at being thus obstructed in amusements wherein they had committed\r\nno disorder whatever, they collected in great numbers the next day,\r\nattacked the guards in various places, burnt ten or twelve guard houses,\r\nkilled two or three of the guards, and had about six or eight of their own\r\nnumber killed. The city was hereupon put under martial law, and after a\r\nwhile, the tumult subsided, and peace was restored. The public stocks rose\r\nten per cent. on the day of Mr. Neckar's appointment: he was immediately\r\noffered considerable sums of money, and has been able so far to wave the\r\nbenefit of the act of bankruptcy, as to pay in cash all demands, except\r\nthe _remboursements des capitaux_. For these, and for a sure supply of\r\nother wants, he will depend on the States General, and will hasten their\r\nmeetings, as is thought. No other change has yet taken place in the\r\nadministration. The minister of war, however, must certainly follow his\r\nbrother, and some think, and all wish, that Monsieur de Lamoignon, the\r\nGarde des Sceaux, may go out also. The administration of justice is still\r\nsuspended. The whole kingdom seems tranquil at this moment.\r\n\r\nAbroad, no event worth noting has taken place, since my last. The court\r\nof Denmark has not declared it will do anything more than furnish the\r\nstipulated aid to Russia. The King of Prussia has, as yet, made no move\r\nwhich may decide whether he will engage in the war, nor has England sent\r\nany squadron into the Baltic. As the season for action is considerably\r\npassed over, it is become more doubtful, whether any other power will\r\nenter the lists till the next campaign: this will give time for stopping\r\nthe further progress of the war, if they really wish to stop it. Two\r\ncamps, of twenty-five thousand men each, are forming in this country, on\r\nits northern limits. The Prince of Condé has the command of one, and the\r\nDuke de Broglio of the other.\r\n\r\nI trouble you with the enclosed letter from a Henry Watson, claiming\r\nprize moneys, as having served under Admiral Paul Jones, which, I\r\nsuppose, should go to the treasury, or war office. I have the honor to\r\nbe, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COMMISSIONERS OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, September 6, 1788.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--Your favor of July the 3d, came to hand some days ago, and\r\nthat of July the 22d, in the afternoon of yesterday. Knowing that a Mr.\r\nVannet was to leave Paris this morning, to go to Virginia in a vessel\r\nbound from Havre to Potomac, I have engaged him to receive the papers\r\nwhich are the subject of those letters; to take care of them from thence\r\nto Havre, and on the voyage; and when he shall have arrived in the\r\nPotomac, instead of going directly to Richmond, as he intended, he will\r\nproceed with them himself, to New York. I shall pay here, all expenses to\r\ntheir delivery at the ship's side in America, freight included: unless,\r\nperhaps, he may find it necessary to put another covering over them, if he\r\nshould not be able to get them into the cabin; in this case, you will have\r\nto reimburse him for that. I engage to him, that you shall pay him their\r\ntransportation from the ship's side to New York, and his own reasonable\r\nexpenses from the place of his landing to New York, and back to the place\r\nof landing. As he takes that journey for this object only, it would be\r\nreasonable that you give him some gratuity for his time and trouble, and\r\nI suppose it would be accepted by him; but I have made no agreement for\r\nthis. The papers are contained in a large box, and a trunk. They were\r\nsent here by Mr. Ast during my absence in Holland. When they arrived\r\nat the gates of Paris, the officers of the customs opened the trunk, to\r\nsee whether it contained dutiable articles; but finding only books and\r\npapers, they concluded the contents of the box to be of the same nature,\r\nand did not open that. You receive it, therefore, as it came from the\r\nhands of Mr. Ast. A small trunk, which came as a third package from Mr.\r\nAst, and which has never been opened, I have put into the great trunk,\r\nwithout displacing, or ever having touched a single paper, except as far\r\nas was necessary, to make room for that. I shall have the whole corded and\r\nplumbed by the Custom house here, not only to prevent their being opened\r\nat the Custom houses on the road, and at the port of exportation, but to\r\nprove to you, whether they shall have been opened by anybody else, after\r\ngoing out of my hands. If the stamped leads are entire, and the cords\r\nuncut, when you receive them, you will be sure they have not been opened;\r\nthey will be wrapt in oil cloth here, to guard them against the damps of\r\nthe sea, and as I mentioned before, Mr. Vannet will put them under another\r\ncovering, if he finds it necessary, at Havre.\r\n\r\nAt the same time with your last letter, I received from the office of\r\nForeign Affairs, the ratification by Congress of the loan of 1788, for\r\nanother million of guilders. As the necessity of this loan resulted from\r\nthe estimate made by Mr. Adams and myself, which estimate was laid before\r\nCongress, I suppose their ratification of the loan, implies that of the\r\nestimate. One article of this was for the redemption of our captives at\r\nAlgiers. Though your letter says nothing on this subject, I am in hopes\r\nyou have sent orders to the commissioners of the loans at Amsterdam, to\r\nfurnish, as soon as they shall have it, what may be necessary for this\r\npressing call. So also for the foreign officers. If the ratification of\r\nthe loan has been made by Congress, with a view to fulfil the objects\r\nof the estimate, a general order from you to the commissioners of the\r\nloans at Amsterdam, to pay the moneys from time to time, according to\r\nthat estimate, or to such other as you shall furnish them with, might\r\nsave the trouble of particular orders on every single occasion, and the\r\ndisappointments arising from the delay or miscarriage of such orders; but\r\nit is for you to decide on this.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect respect,\r\nGentlemen, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. RUTLEDGE.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, September 9, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have duly received your favors of August 30th and September\r\n4th. The animal, whose skin you saw here, is called the Moose. Monsieur\r\nde Buffon had well known it by name; but he has supposed it to be the\r\nsame as the Rennedeer of Lapland, in his history. Being satisfied myself\r\nthat it was a different animal, I asked the favor of General Sullivan\r\nto have one killed for me, and to send me the skin and skeleton. This is\r\nwhat you saw, it is found only eastward of the Hudson river. M. de Buffon\r\ndescribes the Renne to be about three feet high, and truly, the Moose you\r\nsaw here was seven feet high, and there are some of them ten feet high.\r\nThe experiment was expensive to me, having cost me hunting, curing, and\r\ntransporting, sixty guineas. The animal whose enormous bones are found\r\non the Ohio, is supposed by M. de Buffon and M. Daubenton to have been an\r\nElephant. Dr. Hunter demonstrated it not to have been an Elephant. Similar\r\nbones are found in Siberia, where it is called the Mammoth. The Indians\r\nof America say it still exists very far north in our continent. I suppose\r\nthere is no such thing at Geneva as a copy of my notes on Virginia, or\r\nyou might see the subject treated there somewhat at length, as also some\r\nshort notice of the Moose. I am glad to hear you have been so happy as\r\nto become acquainted with M. de Saussure. He is certainly one of the\r\nbest philosophers of the present age. Cautious in not letting his assent\r\nrun before his evidence, he possesses the wisdom which so few possess of\r\npreferring ignorance to error. The contrary disposition in those who call\r\nthemselves philosophers in this country classes them in fact with the\r\nwriters of romance. You have heard that Virginia has acceded to the new\r\nConstitution. New York has done the same by a majority of five. No news\r\nfrom North Carolina. Congress were proceeding early in July to put the new\r\ngovernment into motion, probably it will be December or January before the\r\nnew Legislature is assembled. Were I to trouble Mr. Shippen with a letter,\r\nI could only repeat the same things over again. Be so good as to say this\r\nto him, to deliver him the enclosed letter with my friendly compliments,\r\nand to accept yourself assurances of the esteem with which I am, dear Sir,\r\nyour most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CUTTING.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, September 9, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 6th instant is just come to hand. To answer\r\nyour quotations from the English papers by reversing every proposition,\r\nwould be to give you the literal truth, but it would be tedious. To lump\r\nit by saying every tittle is false, would be just but unsatisfactory.\r\nI will take the middle course, and give you a summary of political\r\ninformation as far as possessed here on tolerably sure grounds. On the\r\nBaltic nothing of note since the first great action. That was pretty equal\r\nin loss, but rather favorable to the Russians in appearance, because\r\nthey kept the field while the Swedes retired into port. Since that the\r\nSwedes have had a sixty-four gun ship, the Gustavus Adolphus, run ashore\r\nand burnt, and the crew captured by the Russians. Their fleet is rather\r\nconfined within port, I believe we may say blocked up, by Admiral Greigh.\r\nOn land there has been nothing but a petite guerre. The Swedes have failed\r\nin every enterprise. There is considerable discontent in the Swedish\r\nSenate and nation, because the King, contrary to their constitution, has\r\ncommenced an _offensive war_ without consulting the Senate. On the Black\r\nSea nothing has happened since the first victory obtained by the Prince of\r\nNassau and Paul Jones, and the second and third by the Prince of Nassau.\r\nThe Captain Pacha has thrown himself into Oczakow, made a sortie, and\r\nconsiderably discomfitted the Russians. The particulars not known; but\r\nthe siege continues. The Emperor's army has suffered much by sickness\r\nand desertion, but more by imbecility. He has certainly let a campaign\r\npass over without doing anything. Denmark has notified Sweden and the\r\nother courts that she will furnish the stipulated aid to Russia. England\r\nand Prussia have offered their mediation, and Denmark is endeavoring to\r\ncounterpoise their interference by getting this court to offer to join in\r\nthe mediation. The ministerial revolution here is the Archbishop of Sens,\r\nand Mr. Lambert, gone out, and Mr. Neckar come in, in lieu of the last;\r\nnobody will succeed the former, that is to say there will be no premier.\r\nProbably M. de Brienne, minister of war, will go out, as his brother is\r\nout; and it may be doubted whether M. de Lamorignon will not also go.\r\nHe is Garde de Sceaux, as you know; there is no present appearance of\r\nany other change. A bed of justice will be held within a few days to\r\nrevoke all that was done in that of the 8th of May, and to recall the\r\nparliaments. The States General will be called in January, probably.\r\nThe two camps of twenty-five thousand men each, in the north of France,\r\nare now assembling. They are commanded by the Prince of Condé and Duke\r\nde Broglio. This is the sum of affairs as far as can be affirmed with\r\ncertainty. If anything remarkable still turns up before your departure,\r\nI will do myself the pleasure of writing to you. I am, with great esteem,\r\ndear Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COUNT DE MONTMORIN.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, September 11, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In the course of the last war, the house of Schweighauser and\r\nDobrée, of Nantes, and Puchilberg of L'Orient, presented to Dr. Franklin\r\na demand against the United States of America. He, being acquainted with\r\nthe circumstances of the demand, and knowing it to be unfounded, refused\r\nto pay it. They thereupon procured seizure, by judiciary authority,\r\nof certain arms and other military stores which we had purchased in\r\nthis country, and had deposited for embarkation at Nantes; and these\r\nstores have remained in that position ever since. Congress have lately\r\ninstructed me to put an end to this matter. Unwilling to trouble your\r\nExcellency, whenever it can be avoided, I proposed to the parties to\r\nhave the question decided by abitrators, to be chosen by us jointly. They\r\nhave refused it, as you will see by their answers to my letters, copies\r\nof both which I have the honor to enclose you. I presume it to be well\r\nsettled in practice, that the property of one sovereign is not permitted\r\nto be seized within the dominions of another; and that this practice is\r\nfounded not only in mutual respect, but in mutual utility. To what the\r\ncontrary practice would lead, is evident in the present case, wherein\r\nmilitary stores have been stopped, in the course of a war, in which our\r\ngreatest difficulties proceeded from the want of military stores. In their\r\nletter too, they make a merit of not having seized one of our ships of\r\nwar, and certainly, the principle which admits the seizure of arms, would\r\nadmit that of a whole fleet, and would often furnish an enemy the easiest\r\nmeans of defeating an expedition. The parties obliging me, then, to have\r\nrecourse to your Excellency on this occasion, I am under the necessity\r\nof asking an order from you, for the immediate delivery of the stores and\r\nother property of the United States, at Nantes, detained by the house of\r\nSchweighauser and Dobrée, and that of Puchilberg, or by either of them,\r\nunder a pretence of a judicial seizure.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect respect and\r\nesteem, your Excellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE REYNEVAL.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, September 16, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have the honor now to enclose you my observations on the\r\nalteration proposed in the consular convention. There remain only three\r\narticles of those heretofore in question between us, to which I am\r\nunable to agree; that is to say, the second, proposing still to retain\r\npersonal immunities for the consuls, and others attached to their office;\r\nthe eighth, proposing that the navigation code of each nation, shall be\r\nestablished in the territories of the other; and the ninth, insisting that\r\nthe ship's roll shall be conclusive evidence, that a person belongs to the\r\nship.\r\n\r\nThere are several new matters introduced into the draught; some of\r\nthese are agreed to; others cannot be admitted, as being contrary to the\r\nsame principles which had obliged me to disagree to some of the former\r\narticles. The greatest part of the eleventh, and the whole of the twelfth\r\nnew articles, are in this predicament. They propose, that no person shall\r\nbe arrested on board a merchant vessel, for any cause, but in presence of\r\nthe consul; that no such vessel shall be visited, but in his presence; and\r\nthat when the officers of justice have reason to believe that a criminal\r\nhas taken refuge on board a vessel of war, the captain's word shall be\r\nconclusive evidence that he is not there.\r\n\r\nTo the objections which I had the honor of stating in my letter to his\r\nExcellency, the Count de Montmorin, I have now that of adding some other\r\nobservations, of which I request your perusal. I enclose with them a\r\ndraught, on the basis of the one you were pleased to give me, altered so\r\nas to reconcile it to the spirit of our laws.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MARQUIS DE LA ROUERIE.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, September 16, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--On receiving the first letters which you did me the honor to write\r\nto me, on the arrears due to you from the United States, I informed you\r\nthat I had nothing to do in the money department; that the subject of\r\nyour letters belonged altogether to the treasury board, and to Mr. Grand,\r\ntheir banker here, to the former of whom I forwarded your letters. As\r\nI felt an anxiety, however, that the foreign officers should be paid, I\r\ntook the liberty of pressing the treasury board, from time to time, to\r\nexert themselves for that effect; and I availed myself of an opportunity\r\nwhich occurred last spring, of setting on foot measures, which, with their\r\napprobation, might furnish the means of effecting this payment. So far\r\nmy information to you went, and I added a supposition, that the treasury\r\nboard would probably give orders on the subject, in the course of the\r\nmonth of July. But I made you no promise; it would have been strange if I\r\nhad; nor does my office, nor anything I have ever said or done, subject me\r\nto the demand of immediate payment, which you are pleased to make on me,\r\nnor call on me for any declaration or answer, positive or negative.\r\n\r\nFinding that my interference, which was friendly only, and avowed to\r\nbe inofficial, has given occasion to your letter of yesterday, in a\r\nstyle which I did not expect, and to which I can have no motive for\r\nfurther exposing myself, I must take the liberty of desiring that the\r\ncorrespondence between us on this subject, may cease. I presume that the\r\ncertificate given you, points out the person, here or elsewhere, to whom\r\nyour applications are to be made, and that he will inform you when he\r\nreceives orders on your subject. I am, Sir, your humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, September 20, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The evening of your departure, a letter came by the way of\r\nLondon and New York, addressed to you, and probably from Virginia. I think\r\nyou wished your American letters to remain here; I shall therefore keep\r\nit. The passport now enclosed, came the day after your departure; so also\r\ndid a mass of American letters for me, as low down as August the 10th.\r\nI shall give you their substance. The convention of Virginia annexed to\r\ntheir ratification of the new Constitution a copy of the State declaration\r\nof rights, not by way of condition, but to announce their attachment\r\nto them. They added, also, propositions for specific alterations of the\r\nConstitution. Among these was one for rendering the President incapable\r\nof serving more than eight years, in any term of sixteen. New York has\r\nfollowed the example of Virginia, expressing the substance of her bill of\r\nrights, (that is Virginia's,) and proposing amendments: these last differ\r\nmuch from those of Virginia; but they concur as to the President, only\r\nproposing that he shall be incapable of being elected more than twice. But\r\nI own I should like better than either of these what Luther Martin tells\r\nus was repeatedly voted and adhered to by the federal convention, and only\r\naltered about twelve days before their rising, when some members had gone\r\noff; to wit, that he should be elected for seven years, and incapable for\r\never after. But New York has taken another step, which gives uneasiness;\r\nshe has written a circular letter to all the legislatures, asking their\r\nconcurrence in an immediate convention for making amendments. No news\r\nyet from North Carolina. Electors are to be chosen the first Wednesday\r\nin January; the President to be elected the first Wednesday in February;\r\nthe new legislature to meet the first week in March: the place is not yet\r\ndecided on. Philadelphia was first proposed, and had six and a half votes;\r\nthe half vote was Delaware, one of whose members wanted to take a vote\r\non Wilmington; then Baltimore was proposed and carried, and afterwards\r\nrescinded, so that the matter stood open as ever on the 10th of August;\r\nbut it was allowed the dispute lay only between New York and Philadelphia,\r\nand rather thought in favor of the last. The Rhode Island delegates had\r\nretired from Congress. Dr. Franklin was dangerously ill of the gout and\r\nstone on the 21st of July. My letters of August the 10th not mentioning\r\nhim, I hope he was recovered. Warville, &c. were arrived. Congress had\r\nreferred the decision, as to the independence of Kentucky, to the new\r\ngovernment. Brown ascribes this to the jealousy of the northern States,\r\nwho want Vermont to be received at the same time, in order to preserve a\r\nbalance of interests in Congress. He was just setting out for Kentucky,\r\ndisgusted, yet disposed to persuade to an acquiescence, though doubting\r\nthey would immediately separate from the Union. The principal obstacle to\r\nthis, he thought, would be the Indian war.\r\n\r\nThe following is a quotation from a letter from Virginia, dated July the\r\n12th. \"P----n, though much impaired in health, and in every respect in\r\nthe decline of life, showed as much zeal to carry the new Constitution\r\nas if he had been a young man; perhaps more than he discovered, in the\r\ncommencement of the late revolution, in his opposition to Great Britain.\r\nW----e acted as chairman to the committee of the whole, and, of course,\r\ntook but little part in the debate; but was for the adoption, relying on\r\nsubsequent amendments. B----r said nothing, but was for it. The G----r\r\nexhibited a curious spectacle to view. Having refused to sign the paper,\r\neverybody supposed him against it; but he afterwards had written a letter,\r\nand having taken a part, which might be called rather vehement than\r\nactive, he was constantly laboring to show that his present conduct was\r\nconsistent with that letter, and that letter with his refusal to sign.\r\nM--d--n took the principal share in the debate for it; in which, together\r\nwith the aid I have already mentioned, he was somewhat assisted by\r\nI--nn--s, Lee, M----l, C----n and G. N----s. M--s--n. H----y and Gr----n,\r\nwere the principal supporters of the opposition. The discussion, as might\r\nbe expected, where the parties were so nearly on a balance, was conducted\r\ngenerally with great order, propriety and respect of either party to the\r\nother.\"\r\n\r\nThe assembly of Virginia, hurried to their harvests, would not enter into\r\na discussion of the district bill, but suspended it to the next session.\r\nE. Winston is appointed a judge, vice Gabriel Jones resigned. R. Goode\r\nand Andrew Moore, Counsellors, vice B. Starke dead, and Joseph Egglestone\r\nresigned. It is said Wilson, of Philadelphia, is talked of, to succeed Mr.\r\nA. in London. _Quære?_\r\n\r\nThe dispute about Virgil's tomb and the laurel, seems to be at length\r\nsettled by the testimony of two travellers, given separately, and without\r\na communication with each other. These both say, that attempting to\r\npluck off a branch of the laurel, it followed their hand, being, in\r\nfact, nothing more than a plant or bough, recently cut and stuck in the\r\nground for the occasion. The Cicerone acknowledged the roguery, and said\r\nthey practised it with almost every traveller to get money. You will, of\r\ncourse, tug well at the laurel which shall be shown you, to see if this be\r\nthe true solution.\r\n\r\nThe President Dupaty is dead. Monsieur de Barentin, _premier president de\r\nla cour des aides_, is appointed Garde des Sceaux. The stocks are rather\r\nlower than when you left this. Present me in the most friendly terms to\r\nMessrs. Shippen and Rutledge. I rely on your communicating to them the\r\nnews, and therefore on their pardoning me for not repeating it in separate\r\nletters to them. You can satisfy them how necessary this economy of my\r\ntime and labor is. This goes to Geneva, _poste restante_. I shall not\r\nwrite again till you tell me where to write to.\r\n\r\nAccept very sincere assurances of the affection with which I am, dear Sir,\r\nyour friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, September 24, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Understanding that the vessel is not yet sailed from Havre, which\r\nis to carry my letters of the 3d and 5th instant, I am in hopes you will\r\nreceive the present with them. The Russian accounts of their victories on\r\nthe Black Sea, must have been greatly exaggerated. According to these,\r\nthe Captain Pacha's fleet was annihilated; yet themselves have lately\r\nbrought him on the stage again, with fifteen ships of the line, in order\r\nto obtain another victory over him. I believe the truth to be that he\r\nhas suffered some checks, of what magnitude it is impossible to say where\r\none side alone is heard, and that he is still master of that sea. He has\r\nrelieved Oczakow, which still holds out; Choczim also is still untaken,\r\nand the Emperor's situation is apprehended to be bad. He spun his army\r\ninto a long cord, to cover several hundred miles of frontier, which put\r\nit in the power of the Turks to attack with their whole force wherever\r\nthey pleased. Laudon, now called to head the imperial army, is endeavoring\r\nto collect it; but in the meantime the campaign is drawing to a close,\r\nand has been worse than fruitless. The resistance of Russia to Sweden,\r\nhas been successful in every point, by sea and land. This, with the\r\ninterference of Denmark, and the discontent of the Swedish nation, at the\r\nbreach of their constitution, by the King's undertaking an offensive war,\r\nwithout the consent of the Senate, has obliged him to withdraw his attacks\r\nby land, and to express a willingness for peace; one-third of his officers\r\nhave refused to serve. England and Prussia have offered their mediation\r\nbetween Sweden and Russia, in such equivocal terms, as to leave themselves\r\nat liberty to say it was an offer, or was not, just as it shall suit\r\nthem. Denmark is asking the counter-offer of mediation from this court. If\r\nEngland and Prussia make a peace effectually in the north, (which it is\r\nabsolutely in their power to do,) it will be a proof they do not intend\r\nto enter into the war; if they do not impose a peace, I should suspect\r\nthey mean to engage themselves; as one can hardly suppose they would let\r\nthe war go on in its present form, wherein Sweden must be crushed between\r\nRussia and Denmark.\r\n\r\nThe Garde des Sceaux, M. de Lamoignon, was dismissed the 14th instant,\r\nand M. de Barentin is appointed in his room. The deputies of Bretagne are\r\nreleased from the Bastile, and M. d'Epermesnil and M. Sabatier recalled\r\nfrom their confinement. The parliament is not yet reinstated; but it is\r\nconfidently said it will be this week. The stocks continue low, and the\r\ntreasury under a hard struggle to keep the government in motion. It is\r\nbelieved the meeting of the States General will be as early as January,\r\nperhaps December. I have received a duplicate of the ratification of the\r\nloan of 1788, by Congress, and a duplicate of a letter of July the 22d,\r\nfrom the treasury board, on another subject, but none on that of the\r\ncaptives or foreign officers. I suppose some cause of delay must have\r\nintervened between the ratification of Congress, and the consequent orders\r\nof the Treasury Board. I have the honor to be, with sentiments of the\r\nmost perfect esteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SHIPPEN.\r\n\r\n                                                 PARIS, September 29, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 22d is just received. My occupations obliging\r\nme to economize my time and labor, where it can be done, I have, since\r\nyour departure, addressed either yourself or Mr. Rutledge singly, hoping\r\nyour goodness would excuse my writing to either for both. In like manner,\r\nI have lately written to Mr. Short for all three. I now take the liberty\r\nof addressing you for the triumvirate. No news yet from North Carolina;\r\nbut in such a case no news is good news, as an unfavorable decision of the\r\n12th State would have flown like an electrical shock through America and\r\nEurope. A letter from Governor Rutledge of August 10th, says nothing of\r\nNorth Carolina; this silence is a proof that all was well. That convention\r\nwas to meet July 23d, and not July 4th, as we had been told. A dispute\r\nis excited in Philadelphia which is likely to make a noise. Oswald, the\r\nprinter, being sued, published something in his own paper relative to the\r\ncause. It was construed by the judges a contempt of the court. They made a\r\nrule against him to show cause why he should not be attached. He appeared,\r\nthe attachment was awarded, and he called on to answer interrogatories.\r\nHe refused to answer interrogatories. The court gave him till next\r\nmorning to consider. He appeared then, and still refused. By that time,\r\nhowever, it would seem as if the court themselves had considered better\r\nof it, for their counsel (I suspect it was W----n), declared it was never\r\nthe intention of the court to compel him to answer interrogatories,\r\nand accordingly, without proposing any, or hearing his counsel, they\r\ncommitted him to prison for one month, and fined him ten pounds. Hereupon\r\npetitions were signed, one to the Executive to pardon Oswald, the other\r\nto the Legislature to punish the judges. The news of this country since\r\nmy letter to Mr. Short, is that the Bretagne deputies are recalled from\r\nthe Bastile, and d'Epermesnil and Sabatier from their prisons; the etats\r\ngenereaux are to meet in the course of January, the court keeping the\r\nday of the month still in reserve; the parliament has returned to its\r\nfunctions by permission. Their first arreté has been to demand the etats\r\ngenereaux in the form of 1614. Here the cloven hoof begins to appear.\r\nWhile the existence of parliament itself was endangered by the royal\r\nauthority, they were calling for the etats genereaux; now they obtained\r\na kind of victory, they see danger to themselves from those very etats\r\ngenereaux, and determine to have them in a form which will neither merit\r\nnor command the confidence of the nation, or to prepare a ground for\r\ncombatting their authority if they should be well-composed, and should\r\npropose a reformation of the parliaments. I will, immediately, according\r\nto the desire you are pleased to express, send a French copy of the notes\r\non Virginia to the Syndic Cayla. M. Tronchin goes there himself this week.\r\nI am very sorry you are obliged to abridge your tour. With respect to your\r\nroute from Milan to London, on which you were pleased to consult me, I\r\nwould certainly prefer Genoa, thence along the coast to Nice, (absolutely\r\nby land, in defiance of all the persuasions you will be exposed to go\r\nby water,) thence to Toulon and Marseilles. There it will depend on your\r\ntime, whether you will go by Nismes, the canal of Languedoc (in the post\r\nboat), Bordeaux, Paris and Calais, or whether you must come on directly\r\nfrom Marseilles to Paris and Calais. But even in the latter case, make the\r\nsmall deviation to Nismes, to see the most perfect remains of antiquity\r\nwhich exist on earth. My absence from Paris becomes more doubtful than it\r\nwas. I had hoped to go to Champagne to see the vintage. I am not certain\r\nnow that my business will permit it in every case; letters sent to me here\r\nwill be properly forwarded. Present my affectionate regards to your two\r\ntravelling companions, and be assured of the esteem and attachment with\r\nwhich I am sincerely, dear Sir, your affectionate friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE REYNEVAL.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, October 1, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have now the honor of enclosing to you a copy of the letter of\r\nSeptember the 16th, which I had that of writing to his Excellency the\r\nCount de Montmorin, with the papers therein referred to, and of soliciting\r\nthe order I have asked for. The originals were sent at the date before\r\nmentioned. Notwithstanding the refusal of the houses of Schweighauser\r\nand Dobrée, and of Puchilberg, to settle their claim against the United\r\nStates by arbitration, as I proposed to them, the United States will still\r\nbe ready to do them justice. But those houses must first retire from the\r\nonly two propositions they have ever yet made, to wit, either a payment of\r\ntheir demand without discussion, or a discussion before the tribunals of\r\nthe country. In the meantime, I shall hope an acknowledgment with respect\r\nto us, of the principle which holds as to other nations; that our public\r\nproperty here, cannot be seized by the territorial judge. It is the more\r\ninteresting to us, as we shall be more and longer exposed than other\r\nnations, to draw arms and military stores from Europe. Our preference\r\nof this country, has occasioned us to draw them from hence alone, since\r\nthe peace; and the friendship we have constantly experienced from the\r\ngovernment, will, we doubt not, on this and every other occasion, insure\r\nto us the protection of what we purchase. I have the honor to be, Sir,\r\nyour friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CUTTING.\r\n\r\n                                                       PARIS, Oct. 2, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am now to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of the 16th\r\nand 23d ultimo, and to thank you for the intelligence they conveyed. That\r\nrespecting the case of the interrogatories in Pennsylvania, ought to make\r\na noise. So evident a heresy in the common law, ought not to be tolerated\r\non the authority of two or three civilians, who happened, unfortunately,\r\nto make authority in the courts of England. I hold it essential, in\r\nAmerica, to forbid that any English decision which has happened since the\r\naccession of Lord Mansfield to the bench, should ever be cited in a court;\r\nbecause, though there have come many good ones from him, yet there is so\r\nmuch sly poison instilled into a great part of them, that it is better to\r\nproscribe the whole. Can you inform me what has been done by England, on\r\nthe subject of our wheat and flour? The papers say it is prohibited, even\r\nin Hanover. How do their whale fisheries turn out this year? I hope a deep\r\nwound will be given them in that article, soon, and such as will leave us\r\nin no danger from their competition.\r\n\r\nI am, with very great esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY THE COUNT DE MONTMORIN.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, October 23, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I take the liberty of troubling your Excellency on the subject of\r\nthe _Arret_ which has lately appeared for prohibiting the importation\r\nof whale oil and spermaceti, the produce of foreign fisheries. This\r\nprohibition being expressed in general terms, seems to exclude the whale\r\noils of the United States of America, as well as of the nations of Europe.\r\nThe uniform disposition, however, which his majesty and his ministers\r\nhave shown to promote the commerce between France and the United States,\r\nby encouraging our productions to come hither, and particularly those of\r\nour fisheries, induces me to hope that these were not within their view\r\nat the passing of this _Arret_. I am led the more into this opinion, when\r\nI recollect the assiduity employed for several months, in the year 1785,\r\nby the committee appointed by government to investigate the objects of\r\ncommerce of the two countries, and to report the encouragement of which\r\nit was susceptible. The result of that investigation, which his Majesty's\r\nComptroller General did me the honor to communicate in a letter of the\r\n22d of October, 1786, stating therein the principles which should be\r\nestablished for the future regulation of that commerce, and particularly\r\ndistinguishing the article of whale oils by an abatement of the duties on\r\nthem for the present, and a promise of farther abatement after the year\r\n1790. The thorough re-investigation with which Monsieur de Lambert honored\r\nthis subject, when the letter of 1786 was to be put into the form of an\r\n_Arret_, that _Arret_ itself bearing date the 29th of December last, which\r\nultimately confirmed the abatement of duty, present and future, and Hord\r\ndeclared that his Majesty reserved himself to grant other favors to that\r\nproduction, if, on further information, he shall find it for the interest\r\nof the two nations;--and finally, the letter in which M. Lambert did me\r\nthe honor to enclose the _Arret_, and to assure me that the duties which\r\nhad been levied on our whale oils contrary to the intention of our letter\r\nof 1786, should be restored. On a review of all these circumstances, I\r\ncannot but presume that it has not been intended to reverse in a moment\r\nviews so maturely digested and uniformly pursued; and that the general\r\nexpressions of the _Arret_ of September the 28th, had within their\r\ncontemplation the nations of Europe only. This presumption is further\r\nstrengthened by having observed that in the treaties of commerce, made\r\nsince the epoch of our independence, the _jura gentis amici_ form conceded\r\nto other nations, are expressly restrained to those of the most favored\r\nEuropean nations: his Majesty wisely foreseeing that it would be expedient\r\nto regulate the commerce of a nation, which brings nothing but raw\r\nmaterials to employ the industry of his subjects, very differently from\r\nthat of the European nations, who bring mostly what has already passed\r\nthrough all the stages of manufacture. On these considerations, I take the\r\nliberty of asking information from your Excellency as to the intent of the\r\nlate _Arret_; and if I have not been mistaken in supposing it did not mean\r\nto abridge that of December 29th, I would solicit an explanatory _Arret_,\r\nto prevent the misconstructions of it which will otherwise take place.\r\nIt is much to be desired, too, that this explanation could be given as\r\nsoon as possible, in order that it may be handed out with the _Arret_ of\r\nSeptember 28th. Great alarm will otherwise be spread among the merchants\r\nand adventurers in the fisheries; who, confiding in the stability of\r\nregulations, which his Majesty's wisdom had so long and well matured,\r\nhave embarked their fortunes in speculations in this branch of business.\r\nThe importance of the subject to one of the principal members of our\r\nUnion, induces me to attend with great anxiety a re-assurance from your\r\nExcellency that no change has taken place in his Majesty's views on this\r\nsubject; and that his dispositions to multiply, rather than diminish the\r\ncombinations of interest between the two people, continue unaltered.\r\n\r\nCommerce is slow in changing its channel. That between this country\r\nand the United States is as yet but beginning, and this beginning has\r\nreceived some checks. The _Arret_ in question would be a considerable one,\r\nwithout the explanations I have the honor to ask. I am persuaded that\r\na continuation of the dispositions which have been hitherto manifested\r\ntowards us, will ensure effects, political and commercial, of value to\r\nboth nations.\r\n\r\nI have had too many proofs of the friendly interest your Excellency is\r\npleased to take in whatever may strengthen the bands and connect the views\r\nof the two countries, to doubt your patronage of the present application,\r\nor to pretermit any occasion of repeating assurances of those sentiments\r\nof high respect and esteem with which I have the honor to be, your\r\nExcellency's most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, November 2, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,-- * * * * *\r\n\r\nOur news from America is to the beginning of October. Pennsylvania\r\nhad elected its two Senators for the new government, Robert Morris\r\nand a Mr. McCay. Morris had an arrival from China worth £150,000. An\r\nill-understanding between Mr. Adams and Mr. Hancock, both proposed as\r\nVice-Presidents, and every State likely to bring forward a candidate of\r\ntheir own, in which case, you know, the Senate will choose from among\r\nthose possessing the greatest number of votes, if there be an equality\r\nof votes. A general hail storm about the 26th of August has done great\r\nmischief from New Hampshire to Virginia. It occasioned the price of\r\ntobacco there immediately to rise to 30s. The King of England has for\r\nsome time been at death's door. His disease is dropsical, tending to\r\nthe head. A perpetual delirium, with rare and doubtful lucid intervals,\r\nmakes it strongly believed to be a regular hydrocephalus, in which case\r\nthe skilful pronounce either his death or insanity. The parliament was\r\nto meet yesterday on its prorogation, and it was under contemplation\r\nthat they should establish a regency. Here, the Notables are in session,\r\nbut they have deservedly lost their popularity. It is evident that the\r\ncourt wishes to give to the _tiers etat_ a double number of votes. The\r\nbureau of Monsieur voted this by a majority of one voice only. The other\r\nbureau rejected it almost unanimously. There is a great outcry against\r\nthis, and the friends of the people and of justice will try the question\r\nover again in an assembly of all the bureaux--but there seem no hopes\r\nof success. This is the first event which has shown that there will be\r\na combination of the nobles and clergy, and consequently it will throw\r\nthe people decidedly into the scale of the King. This may end in liberty\r\nor despotism, at his will. I think that both he and his ministry are in\r\nfavor of liberty, and that having twenty-three millions and a half of the\r\npeople on their side, they will call the other half million to order, and\r\nshow them that instead of being two thirds of the nation, they are but the\r\nforty-eighth.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CUTTING.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, November 3, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have now the honor to acknowledge your favors of the 30th of\r\nSeptember, 5th, 6th, 7th and 17th of October, which I should have done\r\nsooner, but that there was no new occurrence well ascertained and worth\r\ncommunicating. I think it now pretty certain that an alliance is entered\r\ninto between England, Prussia, and Sweden, to which Holland is to accede,\r\nso as to make it quadruple. The Prussian army is on its march towards\r\nHolstein, under the command of Prince Frederick of Brunswick; a poor head.\r\nThere is also said to be an army of 60,000 Prussians in Silesia, ready\r\nto overawe Poland, should it take side with Russia. Of this last fact,\r\nhowever, I am not sure. It would seem, then, as if Prussia meant to enter\r\ninto the war, or is it only to induce Denmark to withdraw and leave Russia\r\nand Sweden to fight their own battles? If it does not produce this effect,\r\nwill England lie by, and only engage in case France should move? These\r\nare points uncertain as yet. One thing is certain: that this country will\r\nmake no move which may engage her in war, till after her _Etats Genereux_.\r\nThe Notables meet on Thursday next, to decide on the form of composing\r\nand calling the _Etats Genereux_. What will be their form, cannot yet\r\nbe foreseen; much less what they will do. They will undoubtedly give\r\nmoney to the government, but probably for a short time, and make it the\r\nprice of some concessions from the King for limiting his own rights, and\r\nenlarging those of the nation. They will surely provide for the regular\r\nconvocation of the States General in future. Other things talked of, are\r\na bill of rights, habeas corpus civil list, and a negative at least on\r\nlegislative acts. The kingdom has been in the most perfect tranquillity\r\nsince the announcing the States General for January. I doubt, however, the\r\npossibility of convoking them so soon.\r\n\r\nPrince Henry of Russia arrived here the day before yesterday. Remarkable\r\ndeaths are the Marshal de Biron and Marquis de Chastellux.\r\n\r\nNobody wishes more sincerely than I do to see the States, individually\r\nas well as collectively, extricate themselves from their debts. But\r\nhaving, in the letters I formerly gave you for South Carolina, said as\r\nmuch on that subject as prudence would permit me, I am afraid to add\r\nanything more. I thank you for your information on the subject of the\r\nwhale fishery. After the hint I gave you, you would not expect to see the\r\n_Arret_ of September 26th. I cannot now explain it to you, nor tell you\r\nwith certainty in what form it will finally rest as to us. I am, with very\r\ngreat esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DUMAS.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, November 3, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have duly received your favors of the 10th and 23d of\r\nOctober, and sincerely sympathize with you in your sufferings, without\r\nbeing able to relieve them. Nor can I even conjecture what Congress will\r\ndecide as to the Brussels proposition. I should be puzzled myself to\r\nsuggest anything better at this moment.\r\n\r\nYou have doubtless heard that North Carolina has thought it best to\r\npropose amendments to the new Constitution before acceding to it. She has\r\nno disposition to separate from the Union, even if no amendments be made,\r\nas she has not come to a negative decision, but left the matter open. So\r\nmany States have desired alterations, that I suppose those will be made\r\nin which almost all have agreed. A bill of rights will comprehend most of\r\nthem. In the meantime, the new government will go on.\r\n\r\nThe Notables meet at Versailles the day after to-morrow, to decide on\r\nthe composition and convocation of the States General. Till the States\r\nshall meet, this country will probably not take any measure which may\r\nengage it in a war. In the meantime, the King of Prussia seems itching\r\nto be engaged. He calculates only on the torpitude of the present moment\r\nin which France is: he does not seem to take into account the difference\r\nbetween his head and the late King's. This may be equal, perhaps, to half\r\nhis army. I have the honor to be, with great esteem and attachment, dear\r\nSir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, November 14, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In my letter of December the 21st, 1787, I had the honor of\r\nacknowledging the receipt of your two favors of July the 27th, 1787,\r\nwhich had come to my hands December the 19th, and brought with them\r\nmy full powers for treating on the subject of the consular convention.\r\nBeing then much engaged in getting forward the _Arret_ which came out\r\non the 29th of December, and willing to leave some interval between\r\nthat act and the solicitation of a reconsideration of our consular\r\nconvention, I had declined mentioning it, for some time, and was just\r\nabout to bring it on the carpet, when it became necessary for me to\r\ngo to Amsterdam. Immediately after my return, which was about the last\r\nof April, I introduced the subject to the Count de Montmorin, and have\r\nfollowed it unremittingly, from that time. The office of Marine, as well\r\nas that of Foreign Affairs, being to be consulted in all the stages of\r\nthe negotiation, has protracted its conclusion till this time; it is at\r\nlength signed this day, and I have now the honor to enclose the original,\r\nfor the ratification of Congress. The principal changes effected are the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\nThe clauses of the Convention of 1784, clothing consuls with privileges of\r\nthe law of nations, are struck out, and they are expressly subjected, in\r\ntheir persons and property, to the laws of the land.\r\n\r\nThat giving the right of sanctuary to their houses, is reduced to a\r\nprotection of their chancery room and its papers.\r\n\r\nTheir coercive powers over passengers are taken away; and over those,\r\nwhom they might have termed deserters of their nation, are restrained to\r\ndeserted seamen only.\r\n\r\nThe clause, allowing them to arrest and send back vessels, is struck out,\r\nand instead of it, they are allowed to exercise a police over the ships of\r\ntheir nation generally.\r\n\r\nSo is that, which declared the indelibility of the character of the\r\nsubject, and the explanation and extension of the eleventh article of the\r\ntreaty of amity.\r\n\r\nThe innovations in the laws of evidence are done away; and the convention\r\nis limited to twelve years' duration. Convinced that the fewer examples,\r\nthe better, of either persons or causes unamenable to the laws of the\r\nland, I could have wished still more had been done; but more could not be\r\ndone, with good humor. The extensions of authority given by the convention\r\nof 1784, were so homogeneous with the spirit of this government, that they\r\nwere prized here. Monsieur de Reyneval has had the principal charge of\r\narranging this instrument with me; and, in justice to him, I must say, I\r\ncould not have desired more reasonable and friendly dispositions, than he\r\ndemonstrated through the whole of it.\r\n\r\nI enclose herewith, the several schemes successively proposed between us,\r\ntogether with the copies of the written observations given in with them,\r\nand which served as texts of discussion, in our personal conferences. They\r\nmay serve as a commentary on any passage which may need it, either now\r\nor hereafter, and as a history how any particular passage comes to stand\r\nas it does. No. 1, is the convention of 1784. No. 2, is my first scheme.\r\nNo. 3, theirs in answer to it. No. 4, my next, which brought us so near\r\ntogether, that, in a conference on that, we arranged it in the form in\r\nwhich it has been signed. I add No. 5, the copy of a translation which I\r\nhave put into their hands, with a request, that if they find any passages\r\nin which the sense of the original is not faithfully rendered, they\r\nwill point them out to me; otherwise, we may consider it as having their\r\napprobation. This, and the convention of 1784 (marked No. 1), are placed\r\nside by side, so as to present to the eye, with less trouble, the changes\r\nmade; and I enclose a number of printed copies of them, for the use of the\r\nmembers, who will have to decide on the ratification. It is desirable that\r\nthe ratification should be sent here for exchange, as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the consular appointments, it is a duty on me to add\r\nsome observations, which my situation here has enabled me to make. I\r\nthink it was in the spring of 1784, that Congress (harassed by multiplied\r\napplications from foreigners, of whom nothing was known but on their\r\nown information, or on that of others as unknown as themselves) came to\r\na resolution, that the interest of America would not permit the naming\r\nany person not a citizen, to the office of consul, vice-consul, agent or\r\ncommissary. This was intended as a general answer to that swarm of foreign\r\npretenders. It appears to me, that it will be best, still to preserve a\r\npart of this regulation. _Native_ citizens, on several valuable accounts,\r\nare preferable to aliens, and to citizens alien-born. They possess\r\nour language, know our laws, customs, and commerce; have, generally,\r\nacquaintance in the United States; give better satisfaction, and are\r\nmore to be relied on, in point of fidelity. Their disadvantages are, an\r\nimperfect acquaintance with the language of this country, and an ignorance\r\nof the organization of its judicial and executive powers, and consequent\r\nawkwardness, whenever application to either of these is necessary, as\r\nit frequently is. But it happens, that in some of the principal ports\r\nof France, there is not a single American (as in Marseilles, L'Orient,\r\nand Havre), in others but one (as in Nantes and Rouen), and in Bordeaux\r\nonly, are there two or three. Fortunately for the present moment, most\r\nof these are worthy of appointments. But we should look forward to future\r\ntimes, when there may happen to be no native citizens in a port, but such\r\nas, being bankrupt, have taken asylum in France from their creditors, or\r\nyoung ephemeral adventurers in commerce, without substance or conduct,\r\nor other descriptions, which might disgrace the consular office, without\r\nprotecting our commerce. To avail ourselves of our good _native citizens_,\r\nwhen we have one in a port, and when there are none, to have yet some\r\nperson to attend to our affairs, it appears to me advisable, to declare,\r\nby a standing law, that no person but a native citizen shall be capable\r\nof the office of _consul_, and that the consul's presence in his port\r\nshould suspend, for the time, the functions of the vice-consul. This is\r\nthe rule of 1784, restrained to the office of _consul_, and to _native_\r\ncitizens. The establishing this, by a standing law, will guard against\r\nthe effect of particular applications, and will shut the door against such\r\napplications, which will otherwise be numerous. This done, the office of\r\nvice-consul may be given to the best subject in the port, whether citizen\r\nor alien, and that of consul be kept open for any native citizen of\r\nsuperior qualifications, who might come afterwards to establish himself\r\nin the port. The functions of the vice-consul would become dormant during\r\nthe presence of his principal, come into activity again on his departure,\r\nand thus spare us and them, the painful operation of revoking and reviving\r\ntheir commissions perpetually. Add to this, that during the presence of\r\nthe consul, the vice-consul would not be merely useless, but would be a\r\nvaluable counsellor to his principal, new in the office, the language,\r\nlaws and customs of the country. Every consul and vice-consul should be\r\nrestrained in his jurisdiction, to the port for which he is named, and the\r\nterritory nearer to that than to any other consular or vice consular port,\r\nand no idea be permitted to arise, that the grade of consul gives a right\r\nto any authority whatever over a vice-consul, or draws on any dependence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is now proper I should give some account of the state of our dispute\r\nwith Schweighauser and Dobrée. In the conversation I had with Dobrée\r\nat Nantes, he appeared to think so rationally on the subject, that I\r\nthought there would be no difficulty in accommodating it with him, and\r\nI wished rather to settle it by accommodation, than to apply to the\r\nminister. I afterwards had it intimated to him, through the medium of Mr.\r\nCarnes, that I had it in idea, to propose a reference to arbitrators. He\r\nexpressed a cheerful concurrence in it. I thereupon made the proposition\r\nto him formally, by letter, mentioning particularly, that we would\r\nchoose our arbitrators of some neutral nation, and, of preference, from\r\namong the Dutch refugees here. I was surprised to receive an answer\r\nfrom him, wherein, after expressing his own readiness to accede to this\r\nproposition, he added, that on consulting Mr. Puchilberg, he had declined\r\nit; nevertheless, he wished a fuller explanation from me, as to the\r\nsubjects to be submitted to arbitration. I gave him that explanation,\r\nand he answered finally, that Mr. Puchilberg refused all accommodation,\r\nand insisted that the matter should be decided by the tribunals of the\r\ncountry. Accommodation being at an end, I wrote to Monsieur de Montmorin,\r\nand insisted on the usage of nations, which does not permit the effects of\r\none sovereign to be seized in the territories of another, and subjected\r\nto judiciary decision there. I am promised that the stores shall be\r\ndelivered; but the necessary formalities will occasion some delay. The\r\nKing being authorized to call all causes before himself, ours will be\r\nevoked from the tribunal where it is, and will be ended by an order to\r\ndeliver up the stores arrested, leaving it to the justice of Congress, to\r\ndo afterwards what is right, as to the demand of Schweighauser and Dobrée.\r\nI wish I could receive instructions what to do with the stores, when\r\ndelivered. The arms had certainly better be sent to America, as they are\r\ngood, and yet will sell here for little or nothing. The gun stocks and old\r\niron had better be sold here; but what should be done with the anchors?\r\nBeing thoroughly persuaded that Congress wish that substantial justice\r\nshould be done to Schweighauser and Dobrée, I shall, after the stores are\r\nsecured, repeat my proposition of arbitration to them. If they then refuse\r\nit, I shall return all the papers to America, and consider my powers for\r\nsettling this matter as at an end.\r\n\r\nI have received no answer yet from Denmark, on the subject of the prizes;\r\nnor do I know whether to ascribe this silence to an intention to evade\r\nthe demand, or to the multitude of affairs they have had on their hands\r\nlately. Patience seems to be prudence in this case; to indispose them,\r\nwould do no good, and might do harm. I shall write again soon, if no\r\nanswer be received in the meantime.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following is the translation of the convention referred to as No. 5,\r\nin the preceding letter.]\r\n\r\n    _Convention between his most Christian Majesty and the United\r\n    States of America, for the purpose of defining and establishing\r\n    the functions and privileges of their respective Consuls and\r\n    vice-Consuls._\r\n\r\nHis Majesty the most Christian King, and the United States of America,\r\nhaving, by the twenty-ninth article of the treaty of amity and commerce\r\nconcluded between them, mutually granted the liberty of having, in\r\ntheir respective States and ports, Consuls, vice-Consuls, Agents and\r\nCommissaries, and being willing, in consequence thereof, to define\r\nand establish in a reciprocal and permanent manner, the functions\r\nand privileges of Consuls and vice-Consuls, which they have judged it\r\nconvenient to establish of preference, his M. C. Majesty has nominated\r\nthe Sieur Count of Montmorin of St. Herent, Marechal of his Camps and\r\nArmies, Knight of his Orders and of the Golden Fleece, his Counsellor in\r\nall his Councils, Minister and Secretary of State, and of his Commandments\r\nand Finances, having the department of foreign affairs, and the United\r\nStates have nominated Thomas Jefferson, of the United States of America,\r\nand their Minister Plenipotentiary near the King, who after having\r\ncommunicated to each other their respective full powers, have agreed on\r\nwhat follows:\r\n\r\nArticle I. The Consuls and vice-Consuls named by the M. C. K. and the\r\nUnited States, shall be bound to present their commissions according to\r\nthe forms which shall be established respectively by the M. C. K. within\r\nhis dominions, and by the Congress within the United States, there shall\r\nbe delivered to them, without any charges, the Exequatur necessary for\r\nthe exercise of their functions; and on exhibiting the said Exequatur,\r\nthe governors, commanders, heads of justice, bodies corporate, tribunals\r\nand other officers having authority in the ports and places of their\r\nconsulates, shall cause them to enjoy immediately, and without difficulty,\r\nthe pre-eminences, authority and privileges, reciprocally granted, without\r\nexacting from the said Consuls and vice-Consuls any fee under any pretext\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nArticle II. The Consuls and vice-Consuls, and persons attached to their\r\nfunctions, that is to say, their chancellors and secretaries, shall\r\nenjoy a full and entire immunity for their chancery and the papers which\r\nshall be therein contained; they shall be exempt from all personal\r\nservice, from soldiers' billets, militia, watch, guard, guardianship,\r\ntrusteeship, as well as from all duties, taxes, impositions, and charges\r\nwhatsoever, except on the estate real and personal of which they may be\r\nthe proprietors or possessors, which shall be subject to the taxes imposed\r\non the estates of all other individuals; and in all other instances, they\r\nshall be subject to the laws of the land, as the natives are.\r\n\r\nThose of the said Consuls and vice-Consuls who shall exercise commerce,\r\nshall be respectively subject to all taxes, charges and impositions\r\nestablished on other merchants.\r\n\r\nThey shall place over the outward door of their house the arms of their\r\nsovereign; but this mark of indication shall not give to the said house,\r\nany privilege of asylum for any person or property whatsoever.\r\n\r\nArticle III. The respective Consuls and vice-Consuls may establish agents\r\nin the different ports and places of their departments, where necessity\r\nshall require. These agents may be chosen among the merchants, either\r\nnational or foreign, and furnished with a commission from one of the said\r\nConsuls; they shall confine themselves respectively to the rendering to\r\ntheir respective merchants, navigators, and vessels all possible service,\r\nand to inform the nearest Consul of the wants of the said merchants,\r\nnavigators and vessels, without the said agents otherwise participating\r\nin the immunities, rights and privileges attributed to Consuls and\r\nvice-Consuls, and without power under any pretext whatever, to exact from\r\nthe said merchants any duty or emolument whatsoever.\r\n\r\nArticle IV. The Consuls and vice-Consuls respectively, may establish\r\na chancery, where shall be deposited the consular determinations, acts\r\nand proceedings, as also testaments, obligations, contracts, and other\r\nacts done by or between persons of their nation, and effects left by\r\ndescendents, or saved from shipwreck.\r\n\r\nThey may, consequently, appoint fit persons to act in the said chancery,\r\nqualify and swear them in, commit to them the custody of the seal, and\r\nauthority to seal commissions, sentences and other consular acts, and also\r\nto discharge the functions of notaries and registers of the consulate.\r\n\r\nArticle V. The Consuls and vice-Consuls respectively, shall have the\r\nexclusive right of receiving in their chancery, or on board their vessels,\r\nthe declarations and all other the acts which the captains, masters,\r\ncrews, passengers and merchants of their nation may choose to make there,\r\neven their testaments and other disposals by last will; and the copies\r\nof the said acts, duly authenticated by the said Consuls or vice-Consuls,\r\nunder the seal of their consulate, shall receive faith in law, equally as\r\ntheir originals would, in all the tribunals of the dominions of the M. C.\r\nKing and the United States.\r\n\r\nThey shall also have, and exclusively, in case of the absence of the\r\ntestamentary executor, guardian or lawful representative, the right to\r\ninventory, liquidate, and proceed to the sale of the personal estate\r\nleft by subjects or citizens of their nation, who shall die within\r\nthe extent of their consulate; they shall proceed therein with the\r\nassistance of two merchants of their said nation, or, for want of them,\r\nof any other at their choice, and shall cause to be deposited in their\r\nchancery, the effects and papers of the said estates; and no officer,\r\nmilitary, judiciary, or of the police of the country, shall disturb them\r\nor interfere therein in any manner whatsoever; but the said Consuls and\r\nvice-Consuls shall not deliver up the said effects, nor the proceeds\r\nthereof, to the lawful representatives, or to their order, till they\r\nshall have caused to be paid all debts which the deceased shall have\r\ncontracted in the country; for which purpose, the creditor shall have a\r\nright to attach the said effects in their hands, as they might in those\r\nof any other individual whatever, and proceed to obtain sale of them,\r\ntill payment of what shall be lawfully due to them. When the debts shall\r\nnot have been contracted by judgment, deed or note, the signature whereof\r\nshall be known, payment shall not be ordered, but on the creditor's\r\ngiving sufficient surety resident in that country, to refund the sums he\r\nshall have unduly received, principal, interest and costs; which surety,\r\nnevertheless, shall stand duly discharged after the term of one year,\r\nin time of peace, and of two, in time of war, if the discharge cannot be\r\nformed before the end of this term, against the representatives who shall\r\npresent themselves.\r\n\r\nAnd in order that the representatives may not be unjustly kept out of the\r\neffects of the deceased, the Consuls and vice-Consuls shall notify his\r\ndeath in some one of the gazettes published within their consulate, and\r\nthat they shall retain the said effects in their hands four months, to\r\nanswer all just demands which shall be presented; and they shall be bound,\r\nafter this delay, to deliver to the persons succeeding thereto, what shall\r\nbe more than sufficient for the demands which shall have been formed.\r\n\r\nArticle VI. The Consuls and vice-Consuls respectively, shall receive the\r\ndeclarations, protests and reports, of all captains and masters of their\r\nrespective nations, on account of average losses sustained at sea; and\r\nthese captains and masters shall lodge in the chancery of the said Consuls\r\nand vice-Consuls, the acts which they may have made in other ports, on\r\naccount of the accidents which may have happened to them on their voyage.\r\nIf a subject of the M. C. K. and a citizen of the United States, or a\r\nforeigner, are interested in the said cargo, the average shall be settled\r\nby the tribunals of the country, and not by the Consuls or vice-Consuls;\r\nbut when only the subjects or citizens of their own nation shall be\r\ninterested, the respective Consuls or vice-Consuls shall appoint skilful\r\npersons to settle the damages and average.\r\n\r\nArticle VII. In cases where by tempest, or other accident, French ships\r\nor vessels shall be stranded on the coasts of the United States, and\r\nships or vessels of the United States shall be stranded on the coasts of\r\nthe dominions of the M. C. K., the Consul or vice-Consul nearest to the\r\nplace of shipwreck shall do whatever he may judge proper, as well for the\r\npurpose of saving the said ship or vessel, its cargo and appurtenances, as\r\nfor the storing and the security of the effects and merchandise saved. He\r\nmay take an inventory of them, without the intermeddling of any officers\r\nof the military, of the customs, of justice, or of the police of the\r\ncountry, otherwise than to give the Consuls, vice-Consuls, captain and\r\ncrew of the vessels shipwrecked or stranded, all the succor and favor\r\nwhich they shall ask of them, either for the expedition and security of\r\nthe saving and of the effects saved, as to prevent all disturbance.\r\n\r\nAnd in order to prevent all kind of dispute and discussion in the said\r\ncases of shipwreck, it is agreed that when there shall be no Consul or\r\nvice-Consul to attend to the saving of the wreck, or that the residence of\r\nthe said Consul or vice-Consul (he not being at the place of the wreck)\r\nshall be more distant from the said place than that of the competent\r\njudge of the country, the latter shall immediately proceed therein, with\r\nall the despatch, certainty and precautions, prescribed by the respective\r\nlaws; but the said territorial judge shall retire, on the arrival of the\r\nConsul or vice-Consul, and shall deliver over to him the report of his\r\nproceedings, the expenses of which, the Consul or vice-Consul shall cause\r\nto be reimbursed to him, as well as those of saving the wreck.\r\n\r\nThe merchandise and effects saved, shall be deposited in the nearest\r\nCustom-house, or other place of safety, with the inventory thereof,\r\nwhich shall have been made by the Consul or vice-Consul, or by the judge\r\nwho shall have proceeded in their absence, that the said effects and\r\nmerchandise may be afterwards delivered (after levying therefrom the\r\ncosts), and without form of process, to the owners, who, being furnished\r\nwith an order for their delivery, from the nearest Consul or vice-Consul,\r\nshall reclaim them by themselves, or by their order, either for the\r\npurpose of re-exporting such merchandise, in which case they shall\r\npay no kind of duty of exportation, or for that of selling them in the\r\ncountry, if they be not prohibited there; and in this last case, the said\r\nmerchandise, if they be damaged, shall be allowed an abatement of entrance\r\nduties, proportioned to the damage they have sustained, which shall be\r\nascertained by the affidavits taken at the time the vessel was wrecked or\r\nstruck.\r\n\r\nArticle VIII. The Consuls and vice-Consuls shall exercise police over all\r\nthe vessels of their respective nations, and shall have on board the said\r\nvessels, all power and jurisdiction in civil matters, in all the disputes\r\nwhich may there arise; they shall have an entire inspection over the said\r\nvessels, their crew and the changes and substitutions there to be made.\r\nFor which purpose, they may go on board the said vessels wherever they\r\nmay judge it necessary; well understood, that the functions hereby allowed\r\nshall be confined to the interior of the vessels, and that they shall not\r\ntake place in any case, which shall have any interference with the police\r\nof the ports where the said vessels shall be.\r\n\r\nArticle IX. The Consuls and vice-Consuls may cause to be arrested,\r\nthe captains officers, mariners, sailors, and all other persons, being\r\npart of the crews of the vessels of their respective nations, who shall\r\nhave deserted from the said vessels, in order to send them back, and\r\ntransport them out of the country. For which purpose, the said Consuls and\r\nvice-Consuls shall address themselves to the courts, judges and officers\r\ncompetent, and shall demand the said deserters in writing, proving by\r\nan exhibition of the registers of the vessel or ship's roll, that those\r\nmen were part of the said crews; and on this demand, so proved (saving,\r\nhowever, where the contrary is proved), the delivery shall not be refused;\r\nand there shall be given all aid and assistance to the said Consuls and\r\nvice-Consuls, for the search, seizure and arrest of the said deserters,\r\nwho shall even be detained and kept in the prisons of the country, at\r\ntheir request and expense, until they shall have found an opportunity of\r\nsending them back. But if they be not sent back within three months, to\r\nbe counted from the day of their arrest, they shall be set at liberty, and\r\nshall be no more arrested for the same cause.\r\n\r\nArticle X. In cases where the respective subjects or citizens shall have\r\ncommitted any crime, or breach of the peace, they shall be amenable to the\r\njudges of the country.\r\n\r\nArticle XI. When the said offenders shall be a part of the crew of a\r\nvessel of their nation, and shall have withdrawn themselves on board\r\nthe said vessel, they may be there seized and arrested by order of the\r\njudges of the country; these shall give notice thereof to the Consul\r\nor vice-Consul, who may repair on board, if he thinks proper; but this\r\nnotification shall not, in any case, delay execution of the order in\r\nquestion. The persons arrested, shall not afterwards be set at liberty,\r\nuntil the Consul or vice-Consul shall have been notified thereof; and they\r\nshall be delivered to him, if he requires it, to be put again on board of\r\nthe vessels on which they were arrested, or of others of their nation, and\r\nto be sent out of the country.\r\n\r\nArticle XII. All differences and suits between the subjects of the M. C.\r\nK. in the U. S. or between the citizens of the United States within the\r\ndominions of the M. C. K. and particularly all disputes relative to the\r\nwages and terms of engagement of the crews of the respective vessels, and\r\nall differences of whatever nature they be, which may arise between the\r\nprivates of the said crews, or between any of them and their captains,\r\nor between the captains of different vessels of their nation, shall\r\nbe determined by the respective Consuls and vice-Consuls, either by a\r\nreference to arbitrators, or by a summary judgment, and without costs.\r\n\r\nNo officer of the country, civil or military, shall interfere therein,\r\nor take any part whatever in the matter; and the appeals from the said\r\nconsular sentences, shall be carried before the tribunals of France or of\r\nthe United States, to whom it may appertain to take cognizance thereof.\r\n\r\nArticle XIII. The general utility of commerce, having caused to be\r\nestablished within the dominions of the M. C. K. particular tribunals and\r\nforms, for expediting the decision of commercial affairs, the merchants\r\nof the U. S. shall enjoy the benefit of these establishments; and the\r\nCongress of the U. S. will provide in the manner the most conformable to\r\nits laws, equivalent advantages in favor of the French merchants, for the\r\nprompt despatch and decision of affairs of the same nature.\r\n\r\nArticle XIV. The subjects of the M. C. K. and citizens of the U. S.\r\nwho shall prove by legal evidence, that they are of the said nations\r\nrespectively, shall, in consequence, enjoy an exemption from all personal\r\nservice in the place of their settlement.\r\n\r\nArticle XV. If any other nation acquires, by virtue of any convention\r\nwhatever, a treatment more favorable with respect to the consular\r\npre-eminences, powers, authority and privileges, the Consuls and\r\nvice-Consuls of the M. C. K., or of the U. S. reciprocally, shall\r\nparticipate therein, agreeably to the terms stipulated by the second,\r\nthird, and fourth articles of the treaty of amity and commerce, concluded\r\nbetween the M. C. K. and the U. S.\r\n\r\nArticle XVI. The present convention shall be in full force during the\r\nterm of twelve years, to be counted from the day of the exchange of\r\nratifications, which shall be given in proper form, and exchanged on both\r\nsides, within the space of one year, or sooner, if possible.\r\n\r\nIn faith whereof, we, Ministers Plenipotentiary, have signed the present\r\nconvention, and have thereto set the seal of our arms.\r\n\r\nDone at Versailles the 14th of November, one thousand seven hundred and\r\neighty-eight.\r\n\r\n     L.

S.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, November 18, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My last to you was of the 31st July; since which, I have\r\nreceived yours of July the 24th, August the 10th and 23d. The first part\r\nof this long silence in me, was occasioned by a knowledge that you were\r\nabsent from New York; the latter part, by a want of opportunity, which has\r\nbeen longer than usual. Mr. Shippen being just arrived here, and to set\r\nout to-morrow for London, I avail myself of that channel of conveyance.\r\nMr. Carrington was so kind as to send me the second volume of the American\r\nPhilosophical Transactions, the Federalist, and some other interesting\r\npamphlets; and I am to thank you for another copy of the Federalist, and\r\nthe report of the instructions to the ministers, for negotiating peace.\r\nThe latter, unluckily, omitted exactly the passage I wanted, which was\r\nwhat related to the navigation of the Mississippi. With respect to the\r\nFederalist, the three authors had been named to me. I read it with care,\r\npleasure and improvement, and was satisfied there was nothing in it by\r\none of those hands, and not a great deal by a second. It does the highest\r\nhonor to the third, as being, in my opinion, the best commentary on the\r\nprinciples of government, which ever was written. In some parts, it is\r\ndiscoverable that the author means only to say what may be best said\r\nin defence of opinions, in which he did not concur. But in general, it\r\nestablishes firmly the plan of government. I confess, it has rectified\r\nme on several points. As to the bill of rights, however, I still think\r\nit should be added; and I am glad to see, that three States have at\r\nlength considered the perpetual re-eligibility of the President, as an\r\narticle which should be amended. I should deprecate with you, indeed, the\r\nmeeting of a new convention. I hope they will adopt the mode of amendment\r\nby Congress and the Assemblies, in which case, I should not fear any\r\ndangerous innovation in the plan. But the minorities are too respectable,\r\nnot to be entitled to some sacrifice of opinion, in the majority;\r\nespecially, when a great proportion of them would be contented with a bill\r\nof rights.\r\n\r\nHere, things internally are going on well. The Notables now in session,\r\nhave, indeed, passed one vote, which augurs ill to the rights of the\r\npeople; but if they do not obtain now so much as they have a right to,\r\nthey will in the long run. The misfortune is, that they are not yet ripe\r\nfor receiving the blessings to which they are entitled. I doubt, for\r\ninstance, whether the body of the nation, if they could be consulted,\r\nwould accept of a habeas corpus law, if offered them by the King. If\r\nthe _Etats Genereux_, when they assemble, do not aim at too much, they\r\nmay begin a good constitution. There are three articles which they may\r\neasily obtain; 1, their own meeting, periodically; 2, the exclusive right\r\nof taxation; 3, the right of registering laws and proposing amendments\r\nto them, as exercised now by the parliaments. This last, would be\r\nreadily approved by the court, on account of their hostility against\r\nthe parliaments, and would lead immediately to the origination of laws;\r\nthe second has been already solemnly avowed by the King; and it is well\r\nunderstood, there would be no opposition to the first. If they push at\r\nmuch more, all may fail. I shall not enter further into public details,\r\nbecause my letter to Mr. Jay will give them. That contains a request of\r\npermission to return to America, the next spring, for the summer only. The\r\nreasons therein urged, drawn from my private affairs, are very cogent.\r\nBut there is another, more cogent on my mind, though of a nature not\r\nto be explained in a public letter. It is the necessity of attending my\r\ndaughters, myself, to their own country, and depositing them safely in the\r\nhands of those with whom I can safely leave them. I have deferred this\r\nrequest as long as circumstances would permit, and am in hopes it will\r\nmeet with no difficulty. I have had too many proofs of your friendship,\r\nnot to rely on your patronage of it, as, in all probability, nothing can\r\nsuffer by a short absence. But the _immediate_ permission is what I am\r\nanxious about; as by going in April and returning in October, I shall\r\nbe sure of pleasant and short passages, out and in. I must entreat your\r\nattention, my friend, to this matter, and that the answers may be sent me\r\nthrough several channels.\r\n\r\nMr. Limozin, at Havre, sent you, by mistake, a package belonging to\r\nsomebody else. I do not know what it contained, but he has written to you\r\non the subject, and prayed me to do the same; he is likely to suffer if it\r\nbe not returned.\r\n\r\nSupposing that the funding their foreign debt will be among the first\r\noperations of the new government, I send you two estimates; the one by\r\nmyself, the other by a gentleman infinitely better acquainted with the\r\nsubject, showing what fund will suffice to discharge the principal and\r\ninterest, as it shall become due, aided by occasional loans, which the\r\nsame fund will repay. I enclose them to you, because collating them\r\ntogether, and with your own ideas, you will be able to devise something\r\nbetter than either; but something must be done. This government will\r\nexpect, I fancy, a very satisfactory provision for the payment of their\r\ndebt, from the first session of the new Congress. Perhaps, in this matter,\r\nas well as the arrangement of your foreign affairs, I may be able, when\r\non the spot with you, to give some information and suggest some hints,\r\nwhich may render my visit to my native country not altogether useless.\r\nI consider as no small advantage the resuming the tone of mind of my\r\nconstituents, which is lost by long absence, and can only be recovered\r\nby mixing with them; and shall particularly hope for much profit and\r\npleasure, by contriving to pass as much time as possible with you. Should\r\nyou have a trip to Virginia in contemplation, for that year, I hope you\r\nwill time it so as that we may be there together. I will camp you at\r\nMonticello, where, if illy entertained otherwise, you shall not want\r\nbooks. In firm hope of a happy meeting with you in the spring, or early\r\nin summer, I conclude with assurances of the sincere esteem and attachment\r\nwith which I am, dear Sir, your affectionate friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A. DONALD.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, November 18, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Often solicited by persons on this side the water, to inquire\r\nfor their friends in America, about whose fate they are uncertain, I can\r\nonly hand on their requests to my friends in America. The enclosed letter\r\nfrom the Chevalier de Sigougne, desires some inquiry after his brother,\r\nwhom he supposes to have settled at Todd's Bridge. As this is within your\r\nreach, I must refer the request to your humanity, and beg of you, if you\r\ncan hear of him, you will be so good as to give me an account of him,\r\nreturning me the enclosed letter at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe campaign between the Turks and Russians has been tolerably equal. The\r\nAustrians have suffered through the whole of it. By the interposition\r\nof Prussia and England, peace is likely to be made between Russia,\r\nDenmark, and Sweden. This is a proof that England does not meant to\r\nengage in the war herself. This country will certainly engage herself in\r\nno manner, externally, before the meeting of her States General. This\r\nassembly has been so long disused, that the forms of its convocation\r\noccasion difficulty. The Notables have been convened to prescribe them,\r\nand they are now in session. I am in hopes this will end in giving a\r\ngood degree of liberty to this country. They enjoy, at present, the most\r\nperfect tranquillity within; their stocks, however, continue low, and\r\nmoney difficult to be got for current expenses. It is hoped that Mr.\r\nNeckar's talents and popularity, with the aid of a National Assembly,\r\nwill extricate them from their difficulties. We have been daily expecting\r\nto hear of the death of the King of England: our last news is of the\r\n11th, when he was thought in the utmost danger. This event might produce\r\na great change in the situation of things: it is supposed Mr. Fox would\r\ncome into place, and he has been generally understood to be disposed\r\nfor war. Should the King survive, I think the continuance of peace more\r\nprobable at present, than it has been for some time past. Be so good as to\r\ncontrive the enclosed letter by a very safe conveyance. Remember me in the\r\nmost friendly terms to Dr. Currie, and be assured yourself of the esteem\r\nand attachment with which I am, dear Sir, your affectionate friend and\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, November 19, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Since my letter of September the 5th, wherein I acknowledged Mr.\r\nRemsen's favor of July the 25th, I have written those of September the\r\n24th, and of the 14th instant. This last will accompany the present, both\r\ngoing by the way of London, for want of a direct opportunity; but they go\r\nby a private hand.\r\n\r\nNo late event worth notice has taken place between the Turks and\r\nAustrians. The former continue in the territories of the latter, with all\r\nthe appearances of superiority. On the side of Russia, the war wears an\r\nequal force, except that the Turks are still masters of the Black Sea.\r\nOczakow is not yet taken. Denmark furnished to Russia its stipulated\r\nquota of troops, with so much alacrity, and was making such other warlike\r\npreparations, that it was believed they meant to become principals in the\r\nwar against Sweden. Russia and England hereupon interposed efficaciously.\r\nTheir ministers appointed to mediate, gave notice to the court of\r\nCopenhagen, that they would declare war against them in the name of their\r\ntwo sovereigns, if they did not immediately withdraw their troops from\r\nthe Swedish territories. The court of London has since said, that their\r\nminister (Elliot) went further in this than he was authorized. However,\r\nthe Danish troops are retiring. Poland is augmenting its army from twenty\r\nto an hundred thousand men. Nevertheless, it seems as if England and\r\nPrussia meant, in earnest, to stop the war in that quarter, contented\r\nto leave the two empires in the hands of the Turks. France, desired by\r\nSweden to join the courts of London and Berlin in their mediation between\r\nSweden and Russia, has declined it. We may be assured she will meddle in\r\nnothing external, before the meeting of the States General. Her temporary\r\nannihilation in the political scale of Europe, leaves to England and\r\nPrussia the splendid roll of giving the law without meeting the shadow\r\nof opposition. The internal tranquillity of this country is perfect;\r\ntheir stocks, however, continue low, and the difficulty of getting money\r\nto face current expenses, very great. In the contest between the King\r\nand parliament, the latter, fearing the power of the former, passed the\r\nconvoking the States General. The government found itself obliged by\r\nother difficulties, also to recur to the same expedient. The parliament,\r\nafter its recall, showed that it was now become apprehensive of the States\r\nGeneral, and discovered a determination to cavil at their form, so as to\r\nhave a right to deny their legality, if that body should undertake to\r\nabridge their powers. The court, hereupon, very adroitly determined to\r\ncall the same Notables who had been approved by the nation the last year,\r\nto decide on the form of convoking the Etats Genereux: thus withdrawing\r\nitself from the disputes which the parliament might excite, and committing\r\nthem with the nation. The Notables are now in session. The government\r\nhad manifestly discovered a disposition that the Tiers etat, or Commons,\r\nshould have as many representatives in the States General as the Nobility\r\nand Clergy together; but five _bureaux_ of the Notables have voted by very\r\ngreat majorities, that they should have only an equal number with each of\r\nthe other orders, singly. One _bureau_, by a majority of a single voice,\r\nhad agreed to give the Commons the double number of representatives.\r\nThis is the first symptom of a decided combination between the Nobility\r\nand Clergy, and will necessarily throw the people into the scale of the\r\nKing. It is doubted whether the States can be called so early as January,\r\nthough the government, urged by the want of money, is for pressing the\r\nconvocation. It is still more uncertain, what the States will do when they\r\nmeet: there are three objects which they may attain, probably without\r\nopposition, from the court: 1, a periodical meeting of the States; 2,\r\ntheir exclusive rights of taxation; 3, the right of enregistering laws\r\nand proposing amendments to them, as now exercised by the parliaments.\r\nThis would lead, as it did in England, to the right of originating laws.\r\nThe parliament would, by the last measure, be reduced to a mere judiciary\r\nbody, and would probably oppose it. But against the King and nation, their\r\nopposition could not succeed. If the States stop here, for the present\r\nmoment, all will probably end well, and they may, in future sessions,\r\nobtain a suppression of _lettres de cachet_, a free press, a civil list,\r\nand other valuable modifications of their government. But it is to be\r\nfeared, that an impatience to rectify everything at once, which prevails\r\nin some minds, may terrify the court, and lead them to appeal to force,\r\nand to depend on that alone.\r\n\r\nBefore this can reach you, you will probably have heard of an _Arret_,\r\npassed the 28th of September, for prohibiting the introduction of foreign\r\nwhale oils, without exception. The English had glutted the markets of\r\nthis country with their oils: it was proposed to exclude them, and an\r\n_Arret_ was drawn, with an exception for us: in the last stage of the\r\n_Arret_, the exception was struck out, without my having any warning, or\r\neven suspicion of this. I suspect this stroke came from the Count de La\r\nLuzerne, minister of marine; but I cannot affirm it positively. As soon as\r\nI was apprized of this, which was several days after it passed (because it\r\nwas kept secret till published in their seaports), I wrote to the Count de\r\nMontmorin a letter, of which the enclosed is a copy, and had conference\r\non the subject, from time to time, with him and the other ministers.\r\nI found them prepossessed by the partial information of their Dunkirk\r\nfishermen; and therefore thought it necessary to give them a view of the\r\nwhole subject in writing, which I did: in the place of which, I enclose\r\nyou a printed copy. I therein entered into more details, than the question\r\nbetween us seemed rigorously to require. I was led to them by other\r\nobjects. The most important was, to disgust Mr. Neckar, as an economist,\r\nagainst their new fishery, by letting him foresee its expense. The\r\nparticular manufactures suggested to them, were in consequence of repeated\r\napplications from the shippers of rice and tobacco; other details which\r\ndo not appear immediately pertinent, were occasioned by circumstances\r\nwhich had arisen in conversation, or an apparent necessity of giving\r\ninformation on the whole matter. At a conference, in the presence of M.\r\nLambert, on the 16th (where I was ably aided by the Marquis de La Fayette,\r\nas I have been through the whole business), it was agreed to except us\r\nfrom the prohibition. But they will require rigorous assurance, that\r\nthe oils coming under our name, are really of our fishery. They fear\r\nwe shall cover the introduction of the English oils from Halifax. The\r\n_Arret_ for excepting us was communicated to me, but the formalities of\r\nproving the oils to be American, were not yet inserted. I suppose they\r\nwill require every vessel to bring a certificate from their consul or\r\nvice-consul, residing in the State from which it comes. More difficult\r\nproofs were sometimes talked of. I supposed I might surely affirm to them,\r\nthat our government would do whatever it could to prevent this fraud,\r\nbecause it is as much our interest as theirs, to keep the market for the\r\nFrench and American oils only. I am told Massachusetts has prohibited\r\nthe introduction of foreign fish oils into her ports. This law, if well\r\nexecuted, will be an effectual guard against fraud; and a similar one in\r\nthe other States interested in this fishery, would much encourage this\r\ngovernment to continue her indulgence to us. Though the _Arret_, then, for\r\nthe re-admission of our oils, is not yet passed, I think I may assure you\r\nit will be so in a few days, and of course, that this branch of commerce,\r\nafter so threatening an appearance, will be on a better footing than ever,\r\nas enjoying, jointly with the French oil, a monopoly of their markets.\r\nThe continuance of this will depend on the growth of their fishery.\r\nWhenever they become able to supply their own wants, it is very possible\r\nthey may refuse to take our oils; but I do not believe it possible for\r\nthem to raise their fishery to that, unless they can continue to draw off\r\nour fishermen from us. Their seventeen ships, this year, had one hundred\r\nand fifty of our sailors on board. I do not know what number the English\r\nhave got into their service. You will readily perceive, that there are\r\nparticulars in these printed observations, which it would not be proper\r\nto suffer to become public. They were printed merely that a copy might be\r\ngiven to each minister, and care has been taken to let them go in no other\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nI must now trouble Congress with a petition on my own behalf. When I left\r\nmy own house in October, 1783, it was to attend Congress as a member,\r\nand in expectation of returning in five or six months. In the month of\r\nMay following, however, I was desired to come to Europe, as member of a\r\ncommission, which was to continue two years only. I came off immediately,\r\nwithout going home to make any other arrangements in my affairs, thinking\r\nthey would not suffer greatly before I should return to them. Before\r\nthe close of the two years, Doctor Franklin retiring from his charge\r\nhere, Congress were pleased to name me to it; so that I have been led on\r\nby events, to an absence of five years, instead of five months. In the\r\nmeantime matters of great moment to others as well as myself, and which\r\ncan be arranged by nobody but myself, will await no longer. Another motive\r\nof still more powerful cogency on my mind, is the necessity of carrying\r\nmy family back to their friends and country. I must, therefore, ask of\r\nCongress a leave of short absence. Allowing three months on the sea,\r\ngoing and coming, and two months at my own house, which will suffice for\r\nmy affairs, I need not be from Paris but between five and six months. I\r\ndo not foresee anything which can suffer during my absence. The consular\r\nconvention is finished, except as to the exchange of ratification, which\r\nwill be the affair of a day only. The difference with Schweighauser and\r\nDobrée, relative to our arms, will be finished. That of Denmark, if ever\r\nfinished, will probably be long spun out. The ransom of the Algerine\r\ncaptives, is the only matter likely to be on hand. That cannot be set\r\non foot till the money is raised in Holland, and an order received for\r\nits application; probably these will take place, so that I may set it\r\nin motion before my departure; if not, I can still leave it on such a\r\nfooting as to be put into motion the moment the money can be paid. And\r\neven when the leave of Congress shall be received, I will not make use\r\nof it, if there is anything of consequence which may suffer; but would\r\npostpone my departure till circumstances will admit it. But should these\r\nbe as I expect they will, it will be vastly desirable to me, to receive\r\nthe permission immediately, so that I may go out as soon as the vernal\r\nequinox is over, and be sure of my return in good time and season in\r\nthe fall. Mr. Short, who had had thoughts of returning to America, will\r\npostpone that return till I come back. His talents and character allow\r\nme to say, with confidence, that nothing will suffer in his hands. The\r\nfriendly dispositions of Monsieur de Montmorin would induce him readily\r\nto communicate with Mr. Short in his present character; but should any of\r\nhis applications be necessary to be laid before the Council, they might\r\nsuffer difficulty; nor could he attend the diplomatic societies, which\r\nare the most certain sources of good intelligence. Would Congress think it\r\nexpedient to remove the difficulties, by naming him secretary of legation,\r\nso that he would act, of course, as chargé des affaires during my absence?\r\nIt would be just that the difference between the salary of a secretary\r\nand a secretary of legation should cease, as soon as he should cease to\r\nbe charged with the affairs of the United States; that is to say, on my\r\nreturn; and he would expect that. So that this difference for five or six\r\nmonths, would be an affair of about one hundred and seventy guineas only,\r\nwhich would be not more than equal to the additional expense that would\r\nbe brought on him necessarily by the change of character. I mention these\r\nparticulars, that Congress may see the end as well as the beginning of\r\nthe proposition, and have only to add, \"their will be done.\" Leave for me\r\nbeing obtained, I will ask it, Sir, of your friendship, to avail yourself\r\nof various occasions to the ports of France and England, to convey me\r\nimmediate notice of it, and relieve me as soon as possible from the\r\nanxiety of expectation, and the uncertainty in which I shall be. We have\r\nbeen in daily expectation of hearing of the death of the King of England.\r\nOur latest news are of the 11th. He had then been despaired of, for three\r\nor four days; but as my letter is to pass through England, you will have\r\nlater accounts of him than that can give you. I send you the newspapers to\r\nthis date, and have the honor to be, with the greatest esteem and respect,\r\nSir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. The last crop of corn in France has been so short, that they\r\napprehend want. Mr. Neckar desires me to make known this scarcity to our\r\nmerchants, in hopes they would send supplies. I promised him I would. If\r\nit could be done without naming him, it would be agreeable to him, and\r\nprobably advantageous to the adventurers.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [_The annexed are the observations on the subject of admitting our\r\n    whale oil in the markets of France, referred to in the preceding\r\n    letter._]\r\n\r\nWhale oil enters, as a raw material, into several branches of manufacture,\r\nas of wool, leather, soap: it is used also, in painting, architecture and\r\nnavigation. But its great consumption is in lighting houses and cities.\r\nFor this last purpose, however, it has a powerful competitor in the\r\nvegetable oils. These do well in warm, still weather, but they fix with\r\ncold, they extinguish easily with the wind, their crop is precarious,\r\ndepending on the seasons, and to yield the same light, a larger wick\r\nmust be used, and greater quantity of oil consumed. Estimating all these\r\narticles of difference together, those employed in lighting cities find\r\ntheir account in giving about twenty-five per cent. more for whale, than\r\nfor vegetable oils. But higher than this, the whale oil, in its present\r\nform, cannot rise; because it then becomes more advantageous to the city\r\nlighters to use others. This competition, then, limits its price, higher\r\nthan which no encouragement can raise it; and it becomes, as it were,\r\na law of its nature. But, at this low price, the whale fishery is the\r\npoorest business into which a merchant or sailor can enter. If the sailor,\r\ninstead of wages, has a part of what is taken, he finds that this, one\r\nyear with another, yields him less than he could have got as wages in any\r\nother business. It is attended, too, with great risk, singular hardships,\r\nand long absence from his family. If the voyage is made solely at the\r\nexpense of the merchant, he finds that, one year with another, it does\r\nnot reimburse him his expense. As for example, an English ship of three\r\nhundred tons and forty-two hands, brings home, _communibus annis_, after\r\nfour months' voyage, twenty-five tons of oil, worth four hundred and\r\nthirty-seven pounds ten shillings sterling. But the wages of the officers\r\nand seamen, will be four hundred pounds; the outfit, then, and the\r\nmerchant's profit, must be paid by the government; and it is accordingly\r\non this idea that the British bounty is calculated. From the poverty of\r\nthis business, then, it has happened that the nations who have taken it\r\nup, have successively abandoned it. The Basques began it; but though the\r\nmost economical and enterprising of the inhabitants of France, they could\r\nnot continue it; and it is said they never employed more than thirty ships\r\na year. The Dutch and Hanse towns succeeded them. The latter gave it up\r\nlong ago. The English carried it on in competition with the Dutch, during\r\nthe last and beginning of the present century; but it was too little\r\nprofitable for them, in comparison with other branches of commerce open to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the inhabitants of the barren island of Nantucket had\r\ntaken up this fishery, invited to it, by the whales presenting themselves\r\non their own shore. To them, therefore, the English relinquished it,\r\ncontinuing to them, as British subjects, the importation of their oils\r\ninto England, duty free, while foreigners were subject to a duty of\r\neighteen pounds five shillings sterling, a ton. The Dutch were enabled\r\nto continue it long, because, 1st. They are so near the northern fishing\r\ngrounds, that a vessel begins her fishing very soon after she is out\r\nof port. 2d. They navigate with more economy than the other nations of\r\nEurope. 3d. Their seamen are content with lower wages: and 4th, their\r\nmerchants, with a lower profit on their capital. Under all these favorable\r\ncircumstances, however, this branch of business, after long languishing,\r\nis, at length, nearly extinct with them. It is said, they did not send\r\nabove half a dozen ships in pursuit of the whale, this present year.\r\nThe Nantuckois, then, were the only people who exercised this fishery to\r\nany extent, at the commencement of the late war. Their country, from its\r\nbarrenness yielding no subsistence, they were obliged to seek it in the\r\nsea which surrounded them. Their economy was more rigorous than that of\r\nthe Dutch. Their seamen, instead of wages, had a share in what was taken:\r\nthis induced them to fish with fewer hands, so that each had a greater\r\ndividend in the profit; it made them more vigilant in seeking game, bolder\r\nin pursuing it, and parsimonious in all their expenses. London was their\r\nonly market. When, therefore, by the late Revolution, they became aliens\r\nin Great Britain, they became subject to the alien duty of eighteen\r\npounds five shillings, the ton of oil, which being more than equal to the\r\nprice of the common whale oil, they are obliged to abandon that fishery.\r\nSo that this people, who, before the war, had employed upwards of three\r\nhundred vessels a year, in the whale fishery, (while Great Britain had\r\nherself, never employed one hundred,) have now almost ceased to exercise\r\nit. But they still had the seamen, the most important material for this\r\nfishery; and they still retained the spirit for fishing: so that, at\r\nthe re-establishment of peace, they were capable, in a very short time,\r\nof reviving their fishery, in all its splendor. The British government\r\nsaw that the moment was critical. They knew that their own share in that\r\nfishery, was as nothing; that the great mass of fishermen was left with\r\na nation now separated from them; that these fishermen, however, had lost\r\ntheir ancient market; had no other resource within their country, to which\r\nthey could turn; and they hoped, therefore, they might, in the present\r\nmoment of distress, be decoyed over to their establishments, and be added\r\nto the mass of their seamen. To effect this, they offered extravagant\r\nadvantages to all persons who should exercise the whale fishery from\r\nBritish establishments. But not counting with much confidence, on a long\r\nconnection with their remaining possessions on the continent of America,\r\nforeseeing that the Nantuckois would settle in them, preferably, if put\r\non an equal footing with those of Great Britain, and that thus they might\r\nhave to purchase them the second time, they confined their high offers to\r\nsettlers in Great Britain. The Nantuckois, left without resource by the\r\nloss of their market, began to think of removing to the British dominions;\r\nsome to Nova Scotia, preferring smaller advantages, in the neighborhood\r\nof their ancient country and friends; others to Great Britain, postponing\r\ncountry and friends to high premiums. A vessel was already arrived from\r\nHalifax to Nantucket, to take off some of those who proposed to remove;\r\ntwo families had gone on board, and others were going, when a letter\r\nwas received there, which had been written by Monsieur le Marquis de La\r\nFayette, to a gentleman in Boston, and transmitted by him to Nantucket.\r\nThe purport of the letter was, to dissuade their accepting the British\r\nproposals, and to assure them, that their friends in France would endeavor\r\nto do something for them. This instantly suspended their design: not\r\nanother went on board, and the vessel returned to Halifax, with only the\r\ntwo families.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the French government had not been inattentive to the views\r\nof the British, nor insensible to the crisis. They saw the danger of\r\npermitting five or six thousand of the best seamen existing, to be\r\ntransferred by a single stroke to the marine strength of their enemy, and\r\nto carry over with them an art, which they possessed almost exclusively.\r\nThe counterplan which they set on foot, was, to tempt the Nantuckois, by\r\nhigh offers, to come and settle in France. This was in the year 1785. The\r\nBritish, however, had in their favor a sameness of language, religion,\r\nlaws, habits, and kindred. Nine families only, of thirty-three persons in\r\nthe whole, came to Dunkirk; so that this project was not likely to prevent\r\ntheir emigration to the English establishments, if nothing else had\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nFrance had effectually aided in detaching the United States of America\r\nfrom the _force_ of Great Britain; but, as yet, they seemed to have\r\nindulged only a silent wish, to detach them from her _commerce_. They had\r\ndone nothing to induce that event. In the same year, 1785, while M. de\r\nCalonnes was in treaty with the Nantuckois, an estimate of the commerce\r\nof the United States was submitted to the Count de Vergennes, and it was\r\nshown, that of three millions of pounds sterling, to which their exports\r\namounted, one third might be brought to France, and exchanged against her\r\nproductions and manufactures, advantageously for both nations; provided\r\nthe obstacles of prohibition, monopoly and duty, were either done away\r\nor moderated, as far as circumstances would admit. A committee, which\r\nhad been appointed to investigate a particular one of these objects,\r\nwas thereupon instructed to extend its researches to the whole, and\r\nsee what advantages and facilities the government could offer, for the\r\nencouragement of a general commerce with the United States. The committee\r\nwas composed of persons well skilled in commerce; and after laboring\r\nassiduously for several months, they made their report: the result of\r\nwhich was given in the letter of his Majesty's Comptroller General, of\r\nthe 22d of October, 1786, wherein he stated the principles which should\r\nbe established, for the future regulation of the commerce between France\r\nand the United States. It was become tolerably evident at the date of\r\nthis letter, that the terms offered to the Nantuckois, would not produce\r\ntheir emigration to Dunkirk; and that it would be safest, in every event,\r\nto offer some other alternative, which might prevent their acceptance of\r\nthe British offers. The obvious one was, to open the ports of France to\r\ntheir oils, so that they might still exercise their fishery, remaining\r\nin their native country, and find a new market for its produce, instead\r\nof that which they had lost. The article of whale oil was, accordingly,\r\ndistinguished in the letter of M. de Calonnes, by an immediate abatement\r\nof duty, and promise of further abatement, after the year 1790. This\r\nletter was instantly sent to America, and bid fair to produce there\r\nthe effect intended, by determining the fishermen to carry on their\r\ntrade from their own homes, with the advantage only of a free market\r\nin France, rather than remove to Great Britain, where a free market and\r\ngreat bounty were offered them. An _Arret_ was still to be prepared, to\r\ngive legal sanction to the letter of M. de Calonnes. Monsieur Lambert,\r\nwith a patience and assiduity almost unexampled, went through all the\r\ninvestigations necessary to assure himself, that the conclusion of the\r\ncommittee had been just. Frequent conferences on this subject were held\r\nin his presence; the deputies of the chambers of commerce were heard, and\r\nthe result was, the _Arret_ of December the 29th, 1787, confirming the\r\nabatements of duty, present and future, which the letter of October, 1786,\r\nhad promised, and reserving to his Majesty, to grant still further favors\r\nto that production, if, on further information, he should find it for the\r\ninterest of the two nations.\r\n\r\nThe English had now begun to deluge the markets of France, with their\r\nwhale oils; and they were enabled by the great premiums given by their\r\ngovernment, to undersell the French fisherman, aided by feebler premiums,\r\nand the American, aided by his poverty alone. Nor is it certain, that\r\nthese speculations were not made at the risk of the British government,\r\nto suppress the French and American fishermen in their only market. Some\r\nremedy seemed necessary. Perhaps it would not have been a bad one, to\r\nsubject, by a general law, the merchandise of every nation, and of every\r\nnature, to pay additional duties in the ports of France, exactly equal\r\nto the premiums and drawbacks given on the same merchandise, by their\r\nown government. This might not only counteract the effect of premiums\r\nin the instance of whale oils, but attack the whole British system of\r\nbounties and drawbacks, by the aid of which, they make London the centre\r\nof commerce for the whole earth. A less general remedy, but an effectual\r\none, was, to prohibit the oils of all _European_ nations; the treaty with\r\nEngland requiring only, that she should be treated as well as the most\r\nfavored _European_ nation. But the remedy adopted was, to prohibit all\r\noils, without exception.\r\n\r\nTo know how this remedy will operate, we must consider the quantity of\r\nwhale oil which France consumes annually, the quantity which she obtains\r\nfrom her own fishery; and, if she obtains less than she consumes, we are\r\nto consider what will follow the prohibition.\r\n\r\nThe annual consumption of France, as stated by a person who has good\r\nopportunities of knowing it, is as follows:\r\n\r\n                                     lbs. pesant.   quinteaux.   tons.\r\n  Paris, according to the registers of\r\n    1786                               2,800,000      28,000    1,750\r\n  Twenty-seven other cities, lighted\r\n    by M. Sangrain                       800,000       8,000      500\r\n  Rouen                                  500,000       5,000      312½\r\n  Bordeaux                               600,000       6,000      375\r\n  Lyons                                  300,000       3,000      187½\r\n  Other cities, leather and light      3,000,000      30,000    1,875\r\n                                       ---------      ------    -----\r\n                                       8,000,000      80,000    5,000\r\n\r\nOther calculations, or say rather, conjectures, reduce the consumption\r\nto about half this. It is treating these conjectures with great respect,\r\nto place them on an equal footing with the estimate of the person before\r\nalluded to, and to suppose the truth half way between them. But we will\r\ndo it, and call the present consumption of France only sixty thousand\r\nquintals, or three thousand seven hundred and fifty tons a year. This\r\nconsumption is increasing fast, as the practice of lighting cities is\r\nbecoming more general, and the superior advantages of lighting them with\r\nwhale oil, are but now beginning to be known.\r\n\r\nWhat do the fisheries of France furnish? She has employed, this year,\r\nfifteen vessels in the southern, and two in the northern fishery, carrying\r\nforty-five hundred tons in the whole, or two hundred and sixty-five each,\r\non an average. The English ships, led by Nantuckois as well as the French,\r\nhave never averaged in the southern fishery, more than one-fifth of their\r\nburthen, in the best year. The fifteen ships of France, according to\r\nthis ground of calculation, and supposing the present to have been one\r\nof the best years, should have brought, one with another, one-fifth of\r\ntwo hundred and sixty-five tons, or fifty-three tons each. But we are\r\ntold, they have brought near the double of that, to wit, one hundred tons\r\neach, and fifteen hundred tons in the whole. Supposing the two northern\r\nvessels to have brought home the cargo which is common from the northern\r\nfishery, to wit, twenty-five tons each, the whole produce this year, will\r\nthen be fifteen hundred and fifty tons. This is five and a half months'\r\nprovision, or two-fifths of the annual consumption. To furnish for the\r\nwhole year, would require forty ships of the same size, in years as\r\nfortunate as the present, and eighty-five, _communibus annis_; forty-four\r\ntons, or one-sixth of the burthen, being as high an average as should\r\nbe counted on, one year with another; and the number must be increased,\r\nwith the increasing consumption. France, then, is evidently not yet in\r\na condition to supply her own wants. It is said, indeed, she has a large\r\nstock on hand unsold, occasioned by the English competition. Thirty-three\r\nthousand quintals, including this year's produce, are spoken of: this is\r\nbetween six and seven months' provision; and supposing by the time this is\r\nexhausted that the next year's supply comes in, that will enable her to go\r\non five or six months longer; say a twelvemonth in the whole. But at the\r\nend of the twelve month, what is to be done? The manufactures depending\r\non this article, cannot maintain their competition against those of other\r\ncountries, if deprived of their equal means. When the alternative, then,\r\nshall be presented, of letting them drop, or opening the ports to foreign\r\nwhale oil, it is presumable the latter will be adopted as the lesser evil.\r\nBut it will be too late for America. Her fishery, annihilated during the\r\nlate war, only began to raise its head on the prospect of a market held\r\nout by this country. Crushed by the _Arret_ of September the 28th, in its\r\nfirst feeble effort to revive, it will rise no more. Expeditions, which\r\nrequire the expense of the outfit of vessels, and from nine to twelve\r\nmonths' navigation, as the southern fishery does, most frequented by the\r\nAmericans, cannot be undertaken in sole reliance on a market, which is\r\nopened and shut from one day to another, with little or no warning. The\r\nEnglish alone, then, will remain to furnish these supplies, and they must\r\nbe received even from them. We must accept bread from our enemies, if our\r\nfriends cannot furnish it. This comes exactly to the point, to which that\r\ngovernment has been looking. She fears no rivals in the whale fishery but\r\nAmerica: or rather, it is the whale fishery of America, of which she is\r\nendeavoring to possess herself. It is for this object, she is making the\r\npresent extraordinary efforts, by bounties and other encouragements; and\r\nher success, so far, is very flattering. Before the war, she had not one\r\nhundred vessels in the whale trade, while America employed three hundred\r\nand nine. In 1786, Great Britain employed one hundred and fifty-one\r\nvessels; in 1787, two hundred and eighty-six; in 1788, three hundred and\r\nfourteen, nearly the ancient American number; while the latter has fallen\r\nto about eighty. They have just changed places then; England having gained\r\nexactly what America has lost. France, by her ports and markets, holds\r\nthe balance between the two contending parties, and gives the victory, by\r\nopening and shutting them, to which she pleases. We have still precious\r\nremains of seamen educated in this fishery, and capable, by their poverty,\r\ntheir boldness and address, of recovering it from the English in spite\r\nof their bounties. But this _Arret_ endangers the transferring to Great\r\nBritain every man of them, who is not invincibly attached to his native\r\nsoil. There is no other nation, in present condition, to maintain a\r\ncompetition with Great Britain in the whale fishery. The expense at which\r\nit is supported on her part, seems enormous. Two hundred and fifty-five\r\nvessels, of seventy-five thousand four hundred and thirty-six tons,\r\nemployed by her this year, in the northern fishery, at forty-two men\r\neach; and fifty-nine in the southern, at eighteen men each, make eleven\r\nthousand seven hundred and seventy-two men. These are known to have\r\ncost the government fifteen pounds each, or one hundred and seventy-six\r\nthousand five hundred and eighty pounds, in the whole, and that, to employ\r\nthe principal part of them, from three to four months only. The northern\r\nships have brought home twenty, and the southern sixty tons of oil, on an\r\naverage; making eighty-six hundred and forty tons. Every ton of oil, then,\r\nhas cost the government twenty pounds in bounty. Still, if they can beat\r\nus out of the field and have it to themselves, they will think their money\r\nwell employed. If France undertakes, solely, the competition against them,\r\nshe must do it at equal expense. The trade is too poor to support itself.\r\nThe eighty-five ships, necessary to supply even her present consumption,\r\nbountied, as the English are, will require a sacrifice of twelve hundred\r\nand eighty-five thousand two hundred livres a year, to maintain three\r\nthousand five hundred and seventy seamen, and that a part of the year\r\nonly; and if she will put it to twelve thousand men, in competition with\r\nEngland, she must sacrifice, as they do, four or five millions a year.\r\nThe same number of men might, with the same bounty, be kept in as constant\r\nemploy, carrying stone from Bayonne to Cherbourg, or coal from Newcastle\r\nto Havre, in which navigations they would be always at hand, and become\r\ngood seamen. The English consider among their best sailors, those employed\r\nin carrying coal from Newcastle to London. France cannot expect to raise\r\nher fishery, even to the supply of her own consumption in one year, or in\r\nseveral years. Is it not better, then, by keeping her ports open to the\r\nUnited States, to enable them to aid in maintaining the field against the\r\ncommon adversary, till she shall be in condition to take it herself, and\r\nto supply her own wants? Otherwise, her supplies must aliment that very\r\nforce which is keeping her under. On our part, we can never be dangerous\r\ncompetitors to France. The extent to which we can exercise this fishery,\r\nis limited to that of the barren island of Nantucket, and a few similar\r\nbarren spots; its duration, to the pleasure of this government, as we\r\nhave no other market. A material observation must be added here: sudden\r\nvicissitudes of opening and shutting ports, do little injury to merchants\r\nsettled on the opposite coast, watching for the opening, like the return\r\nof a tide, and ready to enter with it. But they ruin the adventurer,\r\nwhose distance requires six months' notice. Those who are now arriving\r\nfrom America, in consequence of the _Arret_ of December the 29th, will\r\nconsider it as the false light which has led them to their ruin. They\r\nwill be apt to say, that they come to the ports of France by invitation of\r\nthat _Arret_, that the subsequent one of September the 28th, which drives\r\nthem from those ports, founds itself on a single principle, viz. \"that the\r\nprohibition of foreign oils, is the most useful encouragement which can be\r\ngiven to that branch of industry.\" They will say, that, if this be a true\r\nprinciple, it was as true on the 29th of December, 1787, as on the 20th of\r\nSeptember, 1788; it was then weighed against other motives, judged weaker\r\nand overruled, and it is hard it should be now revived, to ruin them.\r\n\r\nThe refinery for whale oil, lately established at Rouen, seems to\r\nbe an object worthy of national attention. In order to judge of its\r\nimportance, the different qualities of whale oil must be noted. Three\r\nqualities are known in the American and English markets. 1st. That of the\r\nspermaceti whale. 2d. Of the Greenland whale. 3d. Of the Brazil whale.\r\n1. The spermaceti whale found by the Nantuckois in the neighborhood of\r\nthe western islands, to which they had gone in pursuit of other whales,\r\nretired thence to the coast of Guinea, afterwards to that of Brazil, and\r\nbegins now to be best found in the latitude of the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nand even of Cape Horn. He is an active, fierce animal, and requires vast\r\naddress and boldness in the fisherman. The inhabitants of Brazil make\r\nlittle expeditions from their coast, and take some of these fish. But\r\nthe Americans are the only distant people who have been in the habit of\r\nseeking and attacking him, in numbers. The British, however, led by the\r\nNantuckois, whom they have decoyed into their service, have begun this\r\nfishery. In 1785, they had eighteen ships in it, in 1787, thirty-eight;\r\nin 1788, fifty-four, or, as some say, sixty-four. I have calculated on the\r\nmiddle number, fifty-nine. Still they take but a very small proportion of\r\ntheir own demand; we furnish the rest. Theirs is the only market to which\r\nwe carry that oil, because it is the only one where its properties are\r\nknown. It is luminous, resists coagulation by cold, to the forty-first\r\ndegree of Fahrenheit's thermometer, and fourth of Reaumur's, and yields no\r\nsmell at all; it is used, therefore, within doors, to lighten shops, and\r\neven in the richest houses, for antichambers, stairs, galleries, &c. It\r\nsells at the London market for treble the price of common whale oil. This\r\nenables the adventurer to pay the duty of eighteen pounds five shillings\r\nsterling the ton, and still to have a living profit. Besides the mass of\r\noil produced from the whole body of the whale, his head yields three or\r\nfour barrels of what is called head matter, from which is made the solid\r\nspermaceti, used for medicine and candles. This sells by the pound, at\r\ndouble the price of the oil. The disadvantage of this fishery is, that the\r\nsailors are from nine to twelve months absent on the voyage; of course,\r\nthey are not at hand on any sudden emergency, and are even liable to be\r\ntaken before they know that war is begun. It must be added, on the subject\r\nof this whale, that he is rare and shy, soon abandoning the grounds\r\nwhere he is hunted. This fishery, less losing than the other, and often\r\nprofitable, will occasion it to be so thronged, soon, as to bring it on a\r\nlevel with the other. It will then require the same extensive support, or\r\nto be abandoned.\r\n\r\n2. The Greenland whale oil is next in quality. It resists coagulation by\r\ncold, to thirty-six degrees of Fahrenheit, and two of Reaumur; but it\r\nhas a smell insupportable within doors, and is not luminous. It sells,\r\ntherefore, in London, at about sixteen pounds the ton. This whale is\r\nclumsy and timid; he dives when struck, and comes up to breathe by the\r\nfirst cake of ice, where the fisherman needs little address or courage\r\nto find and take him. This is the fishery mostly frequented by European\r\nnations; it is this fish which yields the fin in quantity, and the voyages\r\nlast about three or four months.\r\n\r\nThe third quality is that of the small Brazil whale. He was originally\r\nfound on the coast of Nantucket, and first led that people to this\r\npursuit; he retired, first to the Banks of Newfoundland, then to the\r\nwestern islands, and is now found within soundings on the coast of Brazil,\r\nduring the months of December, January, February and March. His oil\r\nchills at fifty degrees of Fahrenheit, and eight of Reaumur, is black and\r\noffensive; worth, therefore, but thirteen pounds the ton, in London. In\r\nwarm summer nights, however, it burns better than the Greenland oil.\r\n\r\nTo the qualities of the oils thus described, it is to be added, that an\r\nindividual has discovered methods, 1, of converting a great part of the\r\noils of the spermaceti whale into the solid substance called spermaceti,\r\nheretofore produced from his head alone; 2, of refining the Greenland\r\nwhale oil, so as to take from it all smell, and render it limpid and\r\nluminous as that of the spermaceti whale; 3, of curdling the oil of the\r\nBrazil whale into tallow, resembling that of beef, and answering all its\r\npurposes. This person is engaged by the company, which has established the\r\nrefinery at Rouen; their works will cost them half a million of livres;\r\nwill be able to refine all the oil which can be used in the kingdom,\r\nand even to supply foreign markets. The effect of this refinery, then,\r\nwould be, 1, to supplant the solid spermaceti of all other nations, by\r\ntheirs, of equal quality, and lower price; 2, to substitute instead of\r\nspermaceti oil, their black whale oil refined, of equal quality, and lower\r\nprice; 3, to render the worthless oil of the Brazil, equal in value to\r\ntallow; and 4, by accommodating these oils to uses, to which they could\r\nnever otherwise have been applied, they will extend the demand beyond its\r\npresent narrow limits, to any supply which can be furnished, and thus give\r\nthe most effectual encouragement and extension to the whale fishery. But\r\nthese works were calculated on the _Arret_ of December the 29th, which\r\nadmitted here, freely and fully, the produce of the American fishery. If\r\nconfined to that of the French fishery alone, the enterprise may fail, for\r\nwant of matter to work on.\r\n\r\nAfter this review of the whale fishery as a political institution, a few\r\nconsiderations shall be added on its produce, as a basis of commercial\r\nexchange between France and the United States. The discussion it has\r\nundergone, on former occasions, in this point of view, leaves little new\r\nto be now urged.\r\n\r\nThe United States, not possessing mines of the precious metals, can\r\npurchase necessaries from other nations, so far only as their produce is\r\nreceived in exchange. Without enumerating our smaller articles, we have\r\nthree of principal importance, proper for the French market; to wit,\r\ntobacco, whale oil and rice. The first and most important, is tobacco.\r\nThis might furnish an exchange for eight millions of the productions of\r\nthis country; but it is under a monopoly, and that not of a mercantile,\r\nbut of a financiering company, whose interest is, to pay in money, and not\r\nin merchandise, and who are so much governed by the spirit of simplifying\r\ntheir purchases and proceedings, that they find means to elude every\r\nendeavor on the part of government, to make them diffuse their purchases\r\namong the merchants in general. Little profit is derived from this, then,\r\nas an article of exchange for the produce and manufactures of France.\r\nWhale oil might be next in importance; but that is now prohibited.\r\nAmerican rice is not yet of great, but it is of growing consumption in\r\nFrance, and being the only article of the three which is free, it may\r\nbecome a principal basis of exchange. Time and trial may add a fourth,\r\nthat is, timber. But some essays, rendered unsuccessful by unfortunate\r\ncircumstances, place that, at present, under a discredit, which it will\r\nbe found hereafter not to have merited. The English know its value, and\r\nwere supplied with it before the war. A spirit of hostility, since that\r\nevent, led them to seek Russian rather than American supplies; a new\r\nspirit of hostility has driven them back from Russia, and they are now\r\nmaking contracts for American timber. But of the three articles before\r\nmentioned, proved by experience to be suitable for the French market,\r\none is prohibited, one under monopoly, and one alone free, and that the\r\nsmallest and of very limited consumption. The way to encourage purchasers,\r\nis, to multiply their means of payment. Whale oil might be an important\r\none. In one scale, are the interests of the millions who are lighted,\r\nshod, or clothed with the help of it, and the thousands of laborers and\r\nmanufacturers, who would be employed in producing the articles which might\r\nbe given in exchange for it, if received from America; in the other scale,\r\nare the interests of the adventurers in the whale fishery; each of whom,\r\nindeed, politically considered, may be of more importance to the State,\r\nthan a simple laborer or manufacturer; but to make the estimate with the\r\naccuracy it merits, we should multiply the numbers in each scale into\r\ntheir individual importance, and see which preponderates.\r\n\r\nBoth governments have seen with concern that their commercial intercourse\r\ndoes not grow as rapidly as they would wish. The system of the United\r\nStates is, to use neither prohibitions nor premiums. Commerce there,\r\nregulates itself freely, and asks nothing better. Where a government\r\nfinds itself under the necessity of undertaking that regulation, it would\r\nseem, that it should conduct it as an intelligent merchant would; that\r\nis to say, invite customers to purchase, by facilitating their means of\r\npayment, and by adapting goods to their taste. If this idea be just,\r\ngovernment here has two operations to attend to, with respect to the\r\ncommerce of the United States; 1, to do away, or to moderate, as much as\r\npossible, the prohibitions and monopolies of their materials for payment;\r\n2, to encourage the institution of the principal manufactures, which the\r\nnecessities or the habits of their new customers call for. Under this\r\nlatter head, a hint shall be suggested, which must find its apology in\r\nthe motive for which it flows; that is, a desire of promoting mutual\r\ninterests and close friendship. Six hundred thousand of the laboring poor\r\nof America, comprehending slaves under that denomination, are clothed in\r\nthree of the simplest manufactures possible; to wit, oznaburgs, plains and\r\nduffel blankets. The first is a linen; the two last, woollens. It happens,\r\ntoo, that they are used exactly by those who cultivate the tobacco and\r\nrice, and in a good degree by those employed in the whale fishery. To\r\nthese manufactures they are so habituated, that no substitute will be\r\nreceived. If the vessels which bring tobacco, rice and whale oil, do not\r\nfind them in the ports of delivery, they must be sought where they can be\r\nfound; that is, in England, at present. If they were made in France, they\r\nwould be gladly taken in exchange there. The quantities annually used by\r\nthis description of people, and their value, are as follows:\r\n\r\n                                                      livres.\r\n  Oznaburgs       2,700,000 aunes,\r\n                    at sixteen sous the aune, worth  2,160,000\r\n  Plains          1,350,000 aunes,\r\n                    at two livres the aune,          2,700,000\r\n  Duffel blankets   300,000 aunes,\r\n                    at seven and four-fifths livres each,\r\n                                                     2,160,000\r\n                                                     ---------\r\n                                                     7,020,000\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to say how much should be added, for the consumption\r\nof inhabitants of other descriptions; a great deal surely. But the present\r\nview shall be confined to the one description named. Seven millions\r\nof livres, are nine millions of day's work, of those who raise, spin\r\nand weave the wool and flax; and, at three hundred working days to the\r\nyear, would maintain thirty thousand people. To introduce these simple\r\nmanufactures, suppose government to give five per cent. on the value of\r\nwhat should be exported of them, for ten years to come; if none should\r\nbe exported, nothing would be to be paid; but on the other hand, if the\r\nmanufactures, with this encouragement, should raise to the full demand,\r\nit will be a sacrifice of three hundred and fifty-one thousand livres a\r\nyear, for ten years only, to produce a perpetual subsistence for more than\r\nthirty thousand people, (for the demand will grow with our population,)\r\nwhile she must expend perpetually one million two hundred and eighty-five\r\nthousand livres a year, to maintain the three thousand five hundred and\r\nseventy seamen, who would supply her with whale oil. That is to say, for\r\neach seaman, as much as for thirty laborers and manufacturers.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our subject, and to conclude.\r\n\r\nWhether, then, we consider the _Arret_ of September the 28th, in a\r\npolitical or a commercial light, it would seem, that the United States\r\nshould be excepted from its operation. Still more so, when they invoke\r\nagainst it the amity subsisting between the two nations, the desire of\r\nbinding them together by every possible interest and connection, the\r\nseveral acts in favor of this exception, the dignity of legislation, which\r\nadmits not of changes backwards and forwards, the interests of commerce,\r\nwhich requires steady regulations, the assurances of the friendly motives\r\nwhich have led the King to pass these acts, and the hope, that no cause\r\nwill arise to change either his motives or his measures towards us.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, November 29, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In the hurry of making up my letter of the 19th inst., I omitted\r\nthe enclosed printed paper, on the subject of whale oil. That omission is\r\nnow supplied by another conveyance, by the way of London. The explanatory\r\n_Arret_ is not yet come out. I still take for granted, it will pass,\r\nthough there be an opposition to it in the Council. In the meantime,\r\norders are given to receive our oils which may arrive. The apprehension of\r\na want of corn, has induced them to turn their eyes to foreign supplies;\r\nand to show their preference of receiving them from us, they have passed\r\nthe enclosed _Arret_, giving a premium on wheat and flour from the United\r\nStates, for a limited time. This, you will doubtless think proper to have\r\ntranslated and published. The Notables are still in session; the votes\r\nof the separate _bureaux_, have not yet been reduced to a joint act, in\r\nan assembly of the whole. I see no reason to suppose they will change\r\nthe separate votes relative to the representation of the Tiers Etat, in\r\nthe States General. In the meantime, the stream of public indignation,\r\nheretofore directed against the court, sets strongly against the Notables.\r\nIt is not yet decided when the States will meet; but certainly they cannot\r\ntill February or March. The Turks have retired across the Danube. This\r\nmovement indicates their going into winter quarters, and the severity of\r\nthe weather must hasten it. The thermometer was yesterday at eight degrees\r\nof Fahrenheit, that is, twenty-four degrees below freezing; a degree of\r\ncold equal to that of the year 1740, which they count here among their\r\ncoldest winters. This having continued many days, and being still likely\r\nto continue, and the wind from northeast, render it probable, that all\r\nenterprize must be suspended between the three great belligerent powers.\r\nPoland is likely to be thrown into great convulsions. The Empress of\r\nRussia has peremptorily demanded such aids from Poland as might engage\r\nin the war. The King of Prussia, on the other hand, threatens to march an\r\narmy on their borders. The vote of the Polish confederacy for one hundred\r\nthousand men, was a coalition of the two parties, in that single act only.\r\nThe party opposed to the King, have obtained a majority, and have voted\r\nthat this army shall be independent of him. They are supported by Prussia,\r\nwhile the King depends on Russia. Authentic information from England,\r\nleaves not a doubt, that the King is lunatic; and that, instead of the\r\neffect, is the cause of the illness, under which he has been so near\r\ndying. I mention this, because the English newspapers, speaking by guess\r\non that as they do on all other subjects, might mislead you as to his true\r\nsituation; or rather, might mislead others, who know less than they do,\r\nthat a thing is not rendered the more probable by being mentioned in those\r\npapers.\r\n\r\nI enclose those of Leyden to the present date with the gazettes of France,\r\nand have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, December 4, 1788.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of August the 31st came to hand yesterday; and a\r\nconfidential conveyance offering, by the way of London, I avail myself of\r\nit, to acknowledge the receipt.\r\n\r\nI have seen, with infinite pleasure, our new Constitution accepted by\r\neleven States, not rejected by the twelfth; and that the thirteenth\r\nhappens to be a State of the least importance. It is true, that the\r\nminorities in most of the accepting States have been very respectable; so\r\nmuch so as to render it prudent, were it not otherwise reasonable, to make\r\nsome sacrifice to them. I am in hopes, that the annexation of a bill of\r\nrights to the Constitution will alone draw over so great a proportion of\r\nthe minorities as to leave little danger in the opposition of the residue;\r\nand that this annexation may be made by Congress and the Assemblies,\r\nwithout calling a convention, which might endanger the most valuable\r\nparts of the system. Calculation has convinced me that circumstances may\r\narise, and probably will arise, wherein all the resources of taxation will\r\nbe necessary for the safety of the State. For though I am decidedly of\r\nopinion we should take no part in European quarrels, but cultivate peace\r\nand commerce with all, yet who can avoid seeing the source of war, in the\r\ntyranny of those nations, who deprive us of the natural right of trading\r\nwith our neighbors? The produce of the United States will soon exceed the\r\nEuropean demand; what is to be done with the surplus, when there shall be\r\none? It will be employed, without question, to open, by force, a market\r\nfor itself, with those placed on the same continent with us, and who wish\r\nnothing better. Other causes, too, are obvious, which may involve us in\r\nwar; and war requires every resource of taxation and credit. The power\r\nof making war often prevents it, and in our case would give efficacy to\r\nour desire of peace. If the new government wears the front which I hope\r\nit will, I see no impossibility in the availing ourselves of the wars of\r\nothers, to open the other parts of America to our commerce, as the price\r\nof our neutrality.\r\n\r\nThe campaign between the Turks and the two empires, has been clearly\r\nin favor of the former. The Emperor is secretly trying to bring about\r\na peace. The alliance between England, Prussia, and Holland (and some\r\nsuspect Sweden also), renders their mediation decisive wherever it is\r\nproposed. They seemed to interpose it so magisterially between Denmark\r\nand Sweden, that the former submitted to its dictates, and there was all\r\nreason to believe that the war in the north-western parts of Europe would\r\nbe quieted. All of a sudden, a new flame bursts out in Poland. The King\r\nand his party are devoted to Russia. The opposition rely on the protection\r\nof Prussia. They have lately become the majority in the confederated\r\ndiet, and have passed a vote for subjecting their army to a commission\r\nindependent of the King, and propose a perpetual diet, in which case he\r\nwill be a perpetual cipher. Russia declares against such a change in their\r\nconstitution, and Prussia has put an army into readiness for marching,\r\nat a moment's warning, on the frontiers of Poland. These events are too\r\nrecent to see, as yet, what turn they will take, or what effect they will\r\nhave on the peace of Europe. So is that also of the lunacy of the King\r\nof England, which is a decided fact, notwithstanding all the stuff the\r\nEnglish papers publish about his fevers, his deliriums, &c. The truth\r\nis, that the lunacy declared itself almost at once, and with as few\r\nconcomitant complaints as usually attend the first development of that\r\ndisorder. I suppose a regency will be established, and if it consists of\r\na plurality of members, it will probably be peaceable. In this event, it\r\nwill much favor the present wishes of this country, which are so decidedly\r\nfor peace, that they refused to enter into the mediation between Sweden\r\nand Russia, lest it should commit them. As soon as the convocation of the\r\nStates General was announced, a tranquillity took place through the whole\r\nkingdom; happily, no open rupture has taken place in any part of it. The\r\nparliaments were reinstated in their functions at the same time. This was\r\nall they desired; and they had called for the States General only through\r\nfear that the crown could not otherwise be forced to reinstate them. Their\r\nend obtained, they began to foresee danger to themselves in the States\r\nGeneral. They began to lay the foundation for cavilling at the legality\r\nof that body, if its measures should be hostile to them. The court, to\r\nclear itself of the dispute, convened the Notables, who had acted with\r\ngeneral approbation on the former occasion, and referred to them the\r\nforms of calling and organizing the States General. These Notables consist\r\nprincipally of Nobility and Clergy; the few of the Tiers Etat among them\r\nbeing either parliament men, or other privileged persons. The court wished\r\nthat, in the future States General, the members of the Tiers Etat should\r\nequal those of both the other orders, and that they should form but one\r\nHouse, all together, and vote by persons, not by orders. But the Notables,\r\nin the true spirit of Priests and Nobles, combining together against the\r\npeople, have voted, by five _bureaux_ out of six, that the people, or\r\nTiers Etat, shall have no greater number of deputies than each of the\r\nother orders separately, and that they shall vote by orders: so that two\r\norders concurring in a vote, the third will be overruled; for it is not\r\nhere as in England, where each of the three branches has a negative on the\r\nother two. If this project of theirs succeeds, a combination between the\r\ntwo Houses of Clergy and Nobles, will render the representation of the\r\nTiers Etat merely nugatory. The _bureaux_ are to assemble together, to\r\nconsolidate their separate votes; but I see no reasonable hope of their\r\nchanging this. Perhaps the King, knowing that he may count on the support\r\nof the nation, and attach it more closely to him, may take on himself to\r\ndisregard the opinion of the Notables in this instance, and may call an\r\nequal representation of the people, in which, precedents will support him.\r\nIn every event, I think the present disquiet will end well. The nation\r\nhas been awaked by our Revolution, they feel their strength, they are\r\nenlightened, their lights are spreading, and they will not retrograde.\r\nThe first States General may establish three important points, without\r\nopposition from the court: 1, their own periodical convocation; 2, their\r\nexclusive right of taxation (which has been confessed by the King); 3,\r\nthe right of registering laws, and of previously proposing amendments to\r\nthem, as the parliaments have, by usurpation, been in the habit of doing.\r\nThe court will consent to this, from its hatred to the parliaments, and\r\nfrom the desire of having to do with one, rather than many legislatures.\r\nIf the States are prudent, they will not aim at more than this at first,\r\nlest they should shock the dispositions of the court, and even alarm the\r\npublic mind, which must be left to open itself by degrees to successive\r\nimprovements. These will follow, from the nature of things; how far\r\nthey can proceed, in the end, towards a thorough reformation of abuse,\r\ncannot be foreseen. In my opinion, a kind of influence which none of\r\ntheir plans of reform take into account, will elude them all; I mean the\r\ninfluence of women, in the government. The manners of the nation allow\r\nthem to visit, alone, all persons in office, to solicit the affairs of\r\nthe husband, family, or friends, and their solicitations bid defiance to\r\nlaws and regulations. This obstacle may seem less to those who, like our\r\ncountrymen, are in the precious habit of considering right, as a barrier\r\nagainst all solicitation. Nor can such an one, without the evidence of his\r\nown eyes, believe in the desperate state to which things are reduced in\r\nthis country from the omnipotence of an influence which, fortunately for\r\nthe happiness of the sex itself, does not endeavor to extend itself in our\r\ncountry beyond the domestic line.\r\n\r\nYour communications to the Count de Moustier, whatever they may have\r\nbeen, cannot have done injury to my endeavors here, to open the West\r\nIndies to us. On this head, the ministers are invincibly mute, though I\r\nhave often tried to draw them into the subject. I have, therefore, found\r\nit necessary to let it lie, till war, or other circumstances, may force\r\nit on. Whenever they are in war with England, they must open the islands\r\nto us, and perhaps, during that war, they may see some price which might\r\nmake them agree to keep them always open. In the meantime, I have laid my\r\nshoulder to the opening the markets of this country to our produce, and\r\nrendering its transportation a nursery for our seamen. A maritime force\r\nis the only one, by which we can act on Europe. Our navigation law (if\r\nit be wise to have any) should be the reverse of that of England. Instead\r\nof confining _importations_ to home-bottoms, or those of the _producing_\r\nnation, I think we should confine _exportations_ to home-bottoms, or to\r\nthose of nations _having treaties with us_. Our exportations are heavy,\r\nand would nourish a great force of our own, or be a tempting price to the\r\nnation to whom we should offer a participation of it, in exchange for free\r\naccess to all their possessions. This is an object to which our government\r\nalone is adequate, in the gross; but I have ventured to pursue it here, so\r\nfar as the consumption of our productions by this country extends. Thus,\r\nin our arrangements relative to tobacco, none can be received here, but\r\nin French or American bottoms. This is employment for near two thousand\r\nseamen, and puts nearly that number of British out of employ. By the\r\n_Arret_ of December, 1787, it was provided, that our whale oils should\r\nnot be received here, but in French or American bottoms; and by later\r\nregulations, all oils, but those of France and America, are excluded. This\r\nwill put one hundred English whale vessels immediately out of employ, and\r\none hundred and fifty ere long; and call so many of French and American\r\ninto service. We have had six thousand seamen formerly in this business,\r\nthe whole of whom we have been likely to lose. The consumption of rice\r\nis growing fast in this country, and that of Carolina gaining ground on\r\nevery other kind. I am of opinion, the whole of the Carolina rice can\r\nbe consumed here. Its transportation employs two thousand five hundred\r\nsailors, almost all of them English at present; the rice being deposited\r\nat Cowes, and brought from thence here. It would be dangerous to confine\r\nthis transportation to French and American bottoms, the ensuing year,\r\nbecause they will be much engrossed by the transportation of wheat and\r\nflour hither, and the crop of rice might lie on hand for want of vessels;\r\nbut I see no objections to the extensions of our principle to this article\r\nalso, beginning with the year 1790. However, before there is a necessity\r\nof deciding on this, I hope to be able to consult our new government in\r\nperson, as I have asked of Congress a leave of absence for six months,\r\nthat is to say, from April to November next. It is necessary for me to\r\npay a short visit to my native country, first, to reconduct my family\r\nthither, and place them in the hands of their friends, and secondly, to\r\nplace my private affairs under certain arrangements. When I left my own\r\nhouse, I expected to be absent but five months, and I have been led by\r\nevents to an absence of five years. I shall hope, therefore, for the\r\npleasure of personal conferences with your Excellency, on the subject\r\nof this letter, and others interesting to our country; of getting my own\r\nideas set to rights by a communication of yours, and of taking again the\r\ntone of sentiment of my own country, which we lose, in some degree, after\r\na certain absence. You know, doubtless, of the death of the Marquis de\r\nChastellux. The Marquis de La Fayette is out of favor with the court, but\r\nhigh in favor with the nation. I once feared for his personal liberty, but\r\nI hope he is on safe ground at present.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of the whale fishery, I enclose you some observations\r\nI drew up for the ministry here, in order to obtain a correction of\r\ntheir _Arret_ of September last, whereby they had involved our oils\r\nwith the English, in a general exclusion from their ports. They will\r\naccordingly correct this, so that our oils will participate with theirs,\r\nin the monopoly of their markets. There are several things incidentally\r\nintroduced, which do not seem pertinent to the general question; they\r\nwere rendered necessary by particular circumstances, the explanation of\r\nwhich, would add to a letter already too long. I will trespass no further,\r\nthan to assure you of the sentiments of sincere attachment and respect\r\nwith which I have the honor to be, your Excellency's most obedient humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\nP. S. The observations enclosed, though printed, have been put into\r\nconfidential hands only.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, December 5, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I had the pleasure of writing to you on the 2d of August, and\r\nof adding a postscript of August the 6th.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYou recollect well the _Arret_ of December the 29th, 1787, in favor of our\r\ncommerce, and which, among other things, gave free admission to our whale\r\noil, under a duty of about two louis a ton. In consequence of the English\r\ntreaty, their oils flowed in, and overstocked the market. The light duty\r\nthey were liable to under the treaty, still lessened by false estimates\r\nand aided by the high premiums of the British government, enabled them\r\nto undersell the French and American oils. This produced an outcry\r\nof the Dunkirk fishery. It was proposed to exclude all European oils,\r\nwhich would not infringe the British treaty. I could not but encourage\r\nthis idea, because it would give to the French and American fisheries a\r\nmonopoly of the French market. The _Arret_ was so drawn up; but, in the\r\nvery moment of passing it, they struck out the word _European_, so that\r\nour oils became involved. This, I believe, was the effect of a single\r\nperson in the ministry. As soon as it was known to me, I wrote to Monsieur\r\nde Montmorin, and had conferences with him and the other ministers. I\r\nfound it necessary to give them information on the subject of the whale\r\nfishery, of which they knew little but from the partial information of\r\ntheir Dunkirk adventurers. I therefore wrote the observations (of which\r\nI enclose you a printed copy), had them printed to entice them to read\r\nthem, and particularly developed the expense at which they are carrying\r\non that fishery, and at which they must continue it, if they do continue\r\nit. This part was more particularly intended for Mr. Neckar, who was quite\r\na stranger to the subject, who has principles of economy, and will enter\r\ninto calculations. Other subjects are incidentally introduced; though\r\nlittle connected with the main question, they had been called for by other\r\ncircumstances. An immediate order was given for the present admission\r\nof our oils, till they could form an _Arret_; and, at a conference, the\r\ndraught of an _Arret_ was communicated to me, which re-established that\r\nof December 29th. They expressed fears, that, under cover of our name, the\r\nNova Scotia oils would be introduced; and a blank was left in the draught,\r\nfor the means of preventing that. They have since proposed, that the\r\ncertificate of their consul shall accompany the oils, to authorize their\r\nadmission, and this is what they will probably adopt. It was observed,\r\nthat if our States would prohibit all foreign oils from being imported\r\ninto them, it would be a great safeguard, and an encouragement to them to\r\ncontinue the admission. Still there remains an expression in the _Arret_,\r\nthat it is provisory only. However, we must be contented with it as it is,\r\nmy hope being, that the legislature will be transferred to the National\r\nAssembly, in whose hands it will be more stable, and with whom it will be\r\nmore difficult to obtain a repeal, should the ministry hereafter desire\r\nit. If they could succeed in drawing over as many of our Nantucket men as\r\nwould supply their demands of oil, we might then fear an exclusion; but\r\nthe present _Arret_, as soon as it shall be passed, will, I hope, place us\r\nin safety till that event, and that event may never happen. I have entered\r\ninto all these details, that you may be enabled to quiet the alarm which\r\nmust have been raised by the _Arret_ of September the 28th, and assure the\r\nadventurers that they may pursue their enterprises as safely as if that\r\nhad never been passed, and more profitably, because we participate now\r\nof a monopolized, instead of an open market. The enclosed observations,\r\nthough printed, have only been given to the ministers, and one or two\r\nother confidential persons. You will see that they contain matter which\r\nshould be kept from the English, and will, therefore, trust them to\r\nthe perusal only of such persons as you can confide in. We are greatly\r\nindebted to the Marquis de La Fayette for his aid on this, as on every\r\nother occasion. He has paid the closest attention to it, and combated for\r\nus, with the zeal of a native.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of reconducting my family to America, and of placing\r\nmy affairs there under permanent arrangements, has obliged me to ask\r\nof Congress a six months' absence, to wit, from April to November\r\nnext. I hope, therefore, to have the pleasure of seeing you there, and\r\nparticularly, that it will be at New York that I shall find you. Be so\r\ngood as to present my sincere esteem to Mrs. Adams, and believe me to be,\r\nwith very affectionate attachment, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, December 8, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My last to you was of the 21st of November, addressed to\r\nMilan, _poste restante_, according to the desire expressed through Mrs.\r\nParadise. I have lately received yours of the 19th of November, and\r\nsincerely felicitate you on your recovery. I wish you may have suffered\r\nthis to be sufficiently established before you set out on your journey.\r\nThe present letter will probably reach you amidst the classical enjoyments\r\nof Rome. I feel myself kindle at the reflection, to make that journey;\r\nbut circumstances will oblige me to postpone it, at least. We are here\r\nunder a most extraordinary degree of cold. The thermometer has been ten\r\ndegrees of Reaumur below freezing; this is eight degrees of Fahrenheit\r\nabove zero, and was the degree of cold here in the year 1740. The long\r\ncontinuance of this severity, and the snow now on the ground, give\r\nphysical prognostications of a hard winter. You will be in a privileged\r\nclimate, and will have had an enviable escape from this. The Notables are\r\nnot yet separated, nor is their treasonable vote against the people yet\r\nconsolidated; but it will be. The parliament have taken up the subject,\r\nand passed a very laudable vote in opposition. They have made it the\r\noccasion of giving sketches of what should be a bill of rights. Perhaps\r\nthis opposition of authority may give the court an option between the two.\r\nStocks are rising slowly, but steadily. The loan of 1784, is at thirteen\r\nloss; the _caisse d'escompte_, four thousand and seventy-five. The Count\r\nde Bryenne has retired, and M. de Puy-segur succeeded to his place. Madame\r\nde Chambonois (sister of M. de Langear) is dead of the small-pox. Pio is\r\nlikely to receive a good appointment in his own country, which will take\r\nhim from us. Corn is likely to become extremely scarce in France, Spain\r\nand England. This country has offered a premium of forty sous the quintal\r\non flour of the United States, and thirty sous the quintal on our wheat,\r\nto be brought here between February and June.\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington writes me that industry and economy begin to take\r\nplace of that idleness and extravagance which had succeeded to the close\r\nof the war. The Potomac canal is in great forwardness. J. M. writes me\r\nword that Mr. Jay and General Knox are talked of in the middle States\r\nfor Vice Presidents, but he queries whether both will not prefer their\r\npresent berths. It seems agreed that some amendments will be made to the\r\nnew Constitution. All are willing to add a bill of rights; but they fear\r\nthe power of internal taxation will be abridged. The friends of the new\r\ngovernment will oppose the method of amendment by a federal convention,\r\nwhich would subject the whole instrument to change, and they will support\r\nthe other method, which admits Congress, by a vote of two-thirds, to\r\nsubmit specific changes to the Assemblies, three-fourths of whom must\r\nconcur to establish them.\r\n\r\nThe enclosed letter is from Pallegrino, one of the Italian laborers\r\nestablished in our neighborhood. I fancy it contains one for his father.\r\nI have supposed it would not be unpleasant to you to have the delivery\r\nof it, as it may give you a good opportunity of conferring with one of\r\nthat class as much as you please. I obey at the same time my own wishes\r\nto oblige the writer. Mazzei is at this time ill, but not in danger. I am\r\nimpatient to receive further letters from you, which may assure me of the\r\nsolidity of your recovery, being with great anxiety for your health and\r\nhappiness, dear Sir, your affectionate friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n   [_The annexed is here inserted in the Author's MS. To whom addressed,\r\n                            does not appear._]\r\n\r\nThe Minister Plenipotentiary for the United States of America, finds\r\nhimself under the necessity of declining to authenticate writings\r\ndestined to be sent to the United States, for this main reason, that such\r\nauthentication is not legal evidence there. After a reason so sufficient,\r\nit seems superfluous to add, that, were his authentication admissible in\r\nthe courts of the United States, he could never give it to any seal or\r\nsignature, which had not been put in his presence; that he could never\r\ncertify a copy, unless both that and the original were in a hand-writing\r\nlegible to him, and had been compared together by him, word by word: that\r\nso numerous are the writings presented, that their authentication alone,\r\nwould occupy the greater part of his time, and withdrawing him from his\r\nproper duties, would change the nature of his office to that of a Notary.\r\nHe observes to those who do him the honor of addressing themselves to\r\nhim on this subject, that the laws for the authentication of foreign\r\nwritings, are not the same through all the United States, some requiring\r\nan authentication under the seal of the Prevoté of a city, and others\r\nadmitting that of a Notary; but that writings authenticated in both these\r\nmanners, will, under the one or the other, be admitted in most, if not\r\nall, of the United States. It would seem advisable, then, to furnish them\r\nwith this double authentication.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR CURRIE.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, December 20, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR DOCTOR,--\"Procrastination is the thief of time,\" so says Young, and\r\nso I find it. It is the only apology, and it is the true one for my having\r\nbeen so long without writing to you. In the meantime I shall overtake\r\nthe present epistle if it be as long getting to you as my letters are\r\nsometimes coming to me from America. I have asked of Congress a leave of\r\nfive or six months' absence this year to carry my family back to America,\r\nand hope to obtain it in time to sail in April from Havre for James river\r\ndirectly. In this case I shall have the pleasure of seeing you at Richmond\r\nand Eppington a few days. This country is seriously meditating the\r\nestablishment of a constitution, and the distress of the court for money\r\nwith the real good intentions of the King, will produce their concurrence\r\nin it. All the world is occupied at present in framing, every one his own\r\nplan, of a bill of rights. The States General will meet probably in March,\r\n(the day not being yet known.) They will probably establish their own\r\nperiodical meetings, their right to participate of the legislation, their\r\nsole right to tax. So far the court will not oppose. Some will endeavor\r\nto procure, at the same time, a habeas corpus law and free press. I doubt\r\nif the latter can be obtained yet, and as for the former, I hardly think\r\nthe nation itself ripe to accept it. Though they see the evil of _lettres\r\nde cachet_, they believe they do more good on the whole. They will think\r\nbetter in time. The right of taxation includes the idea of fixing a civil\r\nlist for the King, and of equalizing the taxes on the clergy and nobility\r\nas well as the commons. The two former orders do not pay one-third of\r\nthe proportion _ad valorum_, which the last pay. This will be a great\r\naddition to their revenue. While engaged so much internally, you may be\r\nassured they wish for external peace. The insanity of the King of England\r\nwill much befriend their desires in this respect. Regencies are generally\r\npeaceable. The war in the north appeared at one time likely to be quieted,\r\nbut new dissensions in Poland threaten to embroil Russia and Prussia.\r\nIn this case Prussia will previously make her peace with the Turks by\r\nceding the Crimea to them. So much for political news. In the literary\r\nway we are like, after a very long dearth of good publications, to have\r\nsomething worth reading. The works of the late King of Prussia in sixteen\r\nvolumes 8vo, appear now. They contain new and curious historical matter.\r\nA work on Grecian Antiquities, by the Abbé Barthelemi, of great classical\r\nlearning, the produce of twenty years' labor, is now in the press, about\r\neight volumes 8vo. A single small volume on government, by the Marquis\r\nde Condorcet, is struggling to get abroad in spite of the prohibition it\r\nis under. You have heard of the new chemical nomenclature endeavored to\r\nbe introduced by Lavoisier, Fourcroy, &c. Other chemists of this country,\r\nof equal note, reject it, and prove, in my opinion, that it is premature,\r\ninsufficient and false. These latter are joined by the British chemists;\r\nand upon the whole, I think the new nomenclature will be rejected,\r\nafter doing more harm than good. There are some good publications in it,\r\nwhich must be translated into the ordinary chemical language before they\r\nwill be useful. A person lately discovered here a very simple method of\r\nbleaching yellow paper, or stained paper, (provided there be no grease\r\non the stain,) by the fumes of the muriatic acid poured on magnesia. He\r\nshowed it to me two or three days after the discovery. On mentioning it\r\nto M. Bertholet, we found that a process on the same principles had, for\r\na year or two past, been adopted successfully for the bleaching linen.\r\nThis is now effected in from eight hours to two or three days, without\r\nrequiring the great bleaching fields which the ancient method does; and\r\nthey say that the linen is less injured. There are two large bleacheries\r\nestablished in this country on this principle, and I believe they are\r\nbeginning to try it in England. There is a vast improvement in the\r\ncomposition of gunpowder, not yet communicated to the public. We are now\r\nat the twenty-ninth livraison of the Encyclopedia. I shall bring to Mr.\r\nHay what he has not yet received, and have then the pleasure of assuring\r\nyou in person of the sentiments of sincere esteem with which I am, dear\r\nSir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS PAINE.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, December 23, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--It is true that I received, very long ago, your favors of\r\nSeptember the 9th and 15th, and that I have been in daily intention\r\nof answering them, fully and confidentially; but you know, such a\r\ncorrespondence between you and me cannot pass through the post, nor\r\neven by the couriers of ambassadors. The French packet boats being\r\ndiscontinued, I am now obliged to watch opportunities by Americans going\r\nto London, to write my letters to America. Hence it has happened, that\r\nthese, the sole opportunities by which I can write to you without fear,\r\nhave been lost, by the multitude of American letters I had to write. I\r\nnow determine, without foreseeing any such conveyance, to begin my letter\r\nto you, so that when a conveyance occurs, I shall only have to add recent\r\noccurrences. Notwithstanding the interval of my answer which has taken\r\nplace, I must beg a continuance of your correspondence; because I have\r\ngreat confidence in your communications, and since Mr. Adams' departure, I\r\nam in need of authentic information from that country.\r\n\r\nI will begin with the subject of your bridge, in which I feel myself\r\ninterested; and it is with great pleasure that I learn, by your favor\r\nof the 16th, that the execution of the arch of experiment exceeds\r\nyour expectations. In your former letter, you mention, that instead of\r\narranging your tubes and bolts as ordinates to the cord of the arch, you\r\nhad reverted to your first idea, of arranging them in the direction of\r\nthe radii. I am sure it will gain, both in beauty and strength. It is true\r\nthat the divergence of those radii recurs as a difficulty, in getting the\r\nrails on upon the bolts; but I thought this fully removed by the answer\r\nyou first gave me, when I suggested that difficulty, to wit, that you\r\nshould place the rails first, and drive the bolts through them, and not,\r\nas I had imagined, place the bolts first, and put the rails on them. I\r\nmust doubt whether what you now suggest, will be as good as your first\r\nidea; to wit, to have every rail split into two pieces longitudinally,\r\nso that there shall be but the halves of the holes in each, and then\r\nto clamp the two halves together. The solidity of this method cannot be\r\nequal to that of the solid rail, and it increases the suspicious part of\r\nthe whole machine, which, in a first experiment, ought to be rendered\r\nas few as possible. But of all this, the practical iron men are much\r\nbetter judges than we theorists. You hesitate between the catenary and\r\nportion of a circle. I have lately received from Italy, a treatise on the\r\nequilibrium of arches, by the Abbé Mascheroni. It appears to be a very\r\nscientific work. I have not yet had time to engage in it; but I find that\r\nthe conclusions of his demonstrations are, that every part of the catenary\r\nis in perfect equilibrium. It is a great point, then, in a new experiment,\r\nto adopt the sole arch, where the pressure will be equally borne by every\r\npoint of it. If any one point is pushed with accumulated pressure, it\r\nwill introduce a danger foreign to the essential part of the plan. The\r\ndifficulty you suggest, is, that the rails being all in catenaries, the\r\ntubes must be of different lengths, as these approach nearer or recede\r\nfarther from each other, and therefore, you recur to the portions of\r\nconcentric circles, which are equi-distant in all their parts. But I would\r\nrather propose, that you make your middle rail an exact catenary, and the\r\ninterior and exterior rails parallels to that. It is true they will not\r\nbe exact catenaries, but they will depart very little from it; much less\r\nthan portions of circles will. Nothing has been done here on the subject\r\nsince you went away. There is an Abbé D'Arnal at Nismes, who has obtained\r\nan exclusive privilege for navigating the rivers of this country, by the\r\naid of the steam engine. This interests Mr. Rumsey, who had hoped the\r\nsame thing. D'Arnal's privilege was published in a paper of the 10th of\r\nNovember. Probably, therefore, his application for it was previous to\r\nthe delivery of Mr. Rumsey's papers to the Secretary of the Academy of\r\nSciences, which was in the latter part of the month of August. However,\r\nD'Arnal is not a formidable competitor. He is not in circumstances to make\r\nany use, himself, of his privilege, and he has so illy succeeded with a\r\nsteam mill he erected at Nismes, that he is not likely to engage others\r\nto venture in his projects. To say another word of the catenarian arch,\r\nwithout caring about mathematical demonstrations, its nature proves it to\r\nbe in equilibrio in every point. It is the arch formed by a string fixed\r\nat both ends, and swaying loose in all the intermediate points. Thus at\r\nliberty, they must finally take that position, wherein every one will be\r\nequally pressed; for if any one was more pressed than the neighboring\r\npoint, it would give way, from the flexibility of the matter of the\r\nstring.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am, with sentiments of sincere esteem and attachment, dear Sir, your\r\nfriend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. THOMAS PAINE.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, December 23, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--As to the affairs of this country, they have hitherto gone on\r\nwell. The Court being decided to call the States General, know that the\r\nform of calling and constituting them would admit of cavil. They asked\r\nthe advice of the Notables. These advised that the form of the last States\r\nGeneral of 1614 be observed. In that, the commons had but about one-third\r\nof the whole number of members, and they voted by orders. The Court wished\r\nnow that they should have one-half of the whole number of members, and\r\nthat they should form but one house, not three. The parliament have taken\r\nup the subject, and given the opinion which the Court would have wished.\r\nWe are, therefore, in hopes that, availing themselves of these contrary\r\nopinions, they will follow that which they wished. The priests and nobles\r\nthreaten schism; and we do not know yet what form will ultimately be\r\nadopted. If no schism of this kind prevents it, the States will meet\r\nabout March or April, and will obtain, without opposition from the Court,\r\n1. Their own periodical convocation; 2. A share in the legislation; 3.\r\nThe exclusive right to tax and appropriate the public money. They will\r\nattempt also to obtain a habeas corpus law and free press; but it does\r\nnot appear to me that the nation is ripe to accept of these, if offered.\r\nThey may try to modify them to their present ideas in their first session,\r\nand at some future day adopt them in all their latitude. Upon the whole,\r\nif the dispute between the privileged and unprivileged orders does not\r\nprevent it, there is no doubt in my mind that they will obtain a fixed,\r\nfree and wholesome Constitution. I should add, also, if external war does\r\nnot call them from this pursuit. But against this they are secured by the\r\ninsanity of the King of England, and they will not suffer themselves to\r\nbe drawn into war by any other nation. There is reason to believe that the\r\ndisturbances lately arisen in Poland, will induce the Empress to make her\r\npeace with the Turks, by parting with the Crimea, that she may be able to\r\nturn herself this way and preserve Poland, of more consequence to her. In\r\nthis event, there is no doubt the Emperor makes peace with the Turks also,\r\nand it would not surprise if he and the Empress should attack the King of\r\nPrussia. I think it is not apprehended here that the death of the King of\r\nSpain will make any change in the politics of that Court. You ask about\r\nMr. Littlepage. We heard that he joined the Prince of Nassau on the Black\r\nSea, but know nothing of him since, nor have we any information about\r\nPaul Jones since the first action on that sea, wherein he was present. You\r\nalso ask when I shall go to America, and whether by the way of England. I\r\nhope to receive my permission in time to sail immediately after the vernal\r\nequinox, because this will give me time to arrange my affairs in America,\r\nand to return here between the autumnal equinox and setting in of the\r\nwinter. I shall certainly not go by the way of England. The encumbrance\r\nof a family and baggage will prevent this. I hope you will find some\r\nconveyance sufficiently confidential to communicate to me by letter what\r\nyou say you wish to communicate in person. While in America, I shall\r\nattend on our President and Senate in order to possess them of such views\r\nof European affairs as I shall have been able to obtain. I shall suppose\r\nthis the more my duty, as they will be forming their plan of foreign\r\naffairs. You have heard of the _Arret_ of September 28th, excluding\r\nforeign whale oils from the ports of this country. I have obtained the\r\npromise of an explanatory _Arret_ to declare that that of September 28th\r\nwas not meant to extend to us. Orders are accordingly given in the ports\r\nto receive ours, and the _Arret_ will soon be published. This places us\r\non a better footing than ever, as it gives us a monopoly of this market in\r\nconjunction with the French fishermen.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CARMICHAEL.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, December 25, 1788.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--A sick family has prevented me, for upwards of a month, from\r\nputting pen to paper but in indispensable cases, and for some time before\r\nthat, I had been waiting to receive American news worth communicating to\r\nyou. These causes have occasioned my silence since my last, which was of\r\nthe 12th of August, and my leaving unacknowledged, till now, your several\r\nfavors of July 24th, Aug. 14th, Sept. 9th and Nov. 3d. That of the 14th\r\ninstant also came to hand the day before yesterday.\r\n\r\nYou have long ago known that eleven States have ratified our new\r\nConstitution, and that North Carolina, contrary to all expectation, had\r\ndeclined either accepting or refusing, but has proposed amendments copied\r\nverbatim from those of Virginia. Virginia and Massachusetts had preferred\r\nthis method of management, that is to say, desiring Congress to propose\r\nspecific amendments to the several legislatures, which is one of the modes\r\nof amendment provided in the new Constitution; in this way nothing can\r\nbe touched but the parts specifically pointed out. New York has written\r\ncircular letters to the legislatures to adopt the other mode of amendment,\r\nprovided also by the Constitution, that is to say, to assemble another\r\nfederal convention. In this way the whole fabric would be submitted to\r\nalteration. Its friends, therefore, unite in endeavoring to have the first\r\nmethod adopted, and they seem agreed to concur in adding a bill of rights\r\nto the Constitution. This measure will bring over so great a part of the\r\nopposition, that what will remain after that will have no other than the\r\ngood effect of watching, as sentinels, the conduct of government, and\r\nlaying it before the public. Many of the opposition wish to take from\r\nCongress the power of internal taxation. Calculation has convinced me\r\nthis would be very mischievous. The Electors are to be chosen the first\r\nWednesday of January; President the first Wednesday in February, and the\r\nnew government is to meet at New York the first Wednesday in March. The\r\nelection of Senators has already begun. Pennsylvania has chosen Mr. R.\r\nMorrison and McClay; Connecticut, Dr. Johnson and Elsworth. I have heard\r\nof no others. I hope there is no doubt of General Washington's acceptance\r\nof the Presidentship. Mr. J. Adams, Mr. Hancock, Mr. Jay and General Knox,\r\nare talked of in the Northern and Middle States for Vice-President. Yet it\r\nis suggested to me that the two latter will probably prefer their present\r\noffices, and the two former divide each other's interest so that neither\r\nmay be chosen. Remarkable deaths are Colonel Bannister of Virginia, and\r\nJohn Penn of North Carolina. General Washington writes me word that the\r\ngreat rains had prevented the continuance of their labors on the Potomac,\r\nso that they should not be able to bring the navigation this winter to\r\nthe great falls as he had hoped. It will want little of it, and no doubt\r\nremains of their completing the whole. That of James River has some time\r\nsince been so far completed as to let vessels pass down to Richmond.\r\nThe crop of wheat in America the last year has been a fine one both for\r\nquantity and quality. This country is likely to want. They have offered\r\na premium of forty sous the quintal on flour of the United States, and\r\nthirty sous on their wheat imported here. They have also opened their\r\nislands for our supplies. Much will come here. Views which bid defiance to\r\nmy calculations had induced this court in an _Arret_ of September 28th,\r\nto comprehend us with the English, in the exclusion of whale oil from\r\ntheir ports, in flat contradiction to their _Arret_ of December last.\r\nThis you know would be a sentence of banishment to the inhabitants of\r\nNantucket, and there is no doubt they would have removed to Nova Scotia\r\nor England, in preference to any other part of the world. A temporary\r\norder, however, is now given for our admittance, and a more prominent one\r\nunder preparation. The internal affairs of this country will, I hope, go\r\non well. Neither the time, place, nor form of the States General are yet\r\nannounced. But they will certainly meet in March or April. The clergy\r\nand nobility, as clergy and nobility eternally will, are opposed to the\r\ngiving to the Tiers Etat so effectual a representation as may dismount\r\nthem from their backs. The court wishes to give to the unprivileged order\r\nan equal number of votes with the privileged, and that they should sit in\r\none house, but the court is timid. Some are of opinion that a majority of\r\nthe nobles are also on the side of the people. I doubt it when so great\r\na proportion of the Notables, indeed almost an unanimity, were against\r\nthem, and five princes of the blood out of seven. If no schism prevents\r\nthe proceedings of the States General, I suppose they will obtain in\r\ntheir first session, 1. The periodical convocation of the States. 2. Their\r\nparticipation in the legislature; and 3. Their exclusive right to levy and\r\nappropriate money; and that at some future day, not very far distant, they\r\nwill obtain a habeas corpus law and free press. They have great need of\r\nexternal peace to let them go on quietly with these internal improvements.\r\nThis seems to be secured to them by the insanity of the King of England.\r\nRegents are generally peaceable, and I think this country will not let\r\nitself be diverted from its object by any other power. There are symptoms\r\nwhich render it suspicious that the two empires may make their peace\r\nwith the Turks. It seems more eligible to Russia to do this by ceding the\r\nCrimea to them, that she may turn to the other side and save Poland, which\r\nthe King of Prussia is endeavoring to wrest from her. Probably the loss\r\nof his principal ally will induce him to adopt a language and a conduct\r\nless Thrasonic.

PRICE.\r\n\r\n                                                    PARIS, January 8, 1789.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I was favored with your letter of October 26th, and far from\r\nfinding any of its subjects uninteresting as you apprehend, they were to\r\nme, as everything which comes from you, pleasing and instructive. I concur\r\nwith you strictly in your opinion of the comparative merits of atheism and\r\ndemonism, and really see nothing but the latter in the being worshipped by\r\nmany who think themselves Christians. Your opinions and writings will have\r\neffect in bringing others to reason on this subject. Our new Constitution,\r\nof which you speak also, has succeeded beyond what I apprehended it would\r\nhave done. I did not at first believe that eleven States out of thirteen\r\nwould have consented to a plan consolidating them as much into one. A\r\nchange in their dispositions, which had taken place since I left them,\r\nhad rendered this consolidation necessary, that is to say, had called\r\nfor a federal government which could walk upon its own legs, without\r\nleaning for support on the State legislatures. A sense of necessity, and a\r\nsubmission to it, is to me a new and consolatory proof that, whenever the\r\npeople are well-informed, they can be trusted with their own government;\r\nthat, whenever things get so far wrong as to attract their notice, they\r\nmay be relied on to set them to rights. You say you are not sufficiently\r\ninformed about the nature and circumstances of the present struggle\r\nhere. Having been on the spot from its first origin, and watched its\r\nmovements as an uninterested spectator, with no other bias than a love\r\nof mankind, I will give you my ideas of it. Though celebrated writers\r\nof this and other countries had already sketched good principles on the\r\nsubject of government, yet the American war seems first to have awakened\r\nthe thinking part of this nation in general from the sleep of despotism\r\nin which they were sunk. The officers too who had been to America, were\r\nmostly young men, less shackled by habit and prejudice, and more ready to\r\nassent to the dictates of common sense and common right. They came back\r\nimpressed with these. The press, notwithstanding its shackles, began to\r\ndisseminate them; conversation, too, assumed new freedom; politics became\r\nthe theme of all societies, male and female, and a very extensive and\r\nzealous party was formed, which may be called the Patriotic party, who,\r\nsensible of the abusive government under which they lived, longed for\r\noccasions of reforming it. This party comprehended all the honesty of the\r\nkingdom, sufficiently at its leisure to think; the men of letters, the\r\neasy bourgeois, the young nobility, partly from re-reflection, partly from\r\nmode; for those sentiments became a matter of mode, and as such united\r\nmost of the young women to the party. Happily for the nation, it happened\r\nthat, at the same moment, the dissipations of the court had exhausted the\r\nmoney and credit of the State, and M. de Calonnes found himself obliged\r\nto appeal to the nation, and to develop to it the ruin of their finances.\r\nHe had no idea of supplying the deficit by economies, he saw no means but\r\nnew taxes. To tempt the nation to consent to these some douceurs were\r\nnecessary. The Notables were called in 1787. The leading vices of the\r\nconstitution and administration were ably sketched out, good remedies\r\nproposed, and under the splendor of the propositions, a demand for\r\nmore money was couched. The Notables concurred with the minister in the\r\nnecessity of reformation, adroitly avoided the demand of money, got him\r\ndisplaced, and one of their leading men placed in his room. The archbishop\r\nof Thoulouse, by the aid of the hopes formed of him, was able to borrow\r\nsome money, and he reformed considerably the expenses of the court.\r\nNotwithstanding the prejudices since formed against him, he appeared to\r\nme to pursue the reformation of the laws and constitution as steadily as\r\na man could do who had to drag the court after him, and even to conceal\r\nfrom them the consequences of the measures he was leading them into. In\r\nhis time the criminal laws were reformed, provincial assemblies and States\r\nestablished in most of the provinces, the States General promised, and a\r\nsolemn acknowledgment made by the King that he could not impose a new tax\r\nwithout the consent of the nation. It is true he was continually goaded\r\nforward by the public clamors, excited by the writings and workings of\r\nthe Patriots, who were able to keep up the public fermentation at the\r\nexact point which borders on resistance, without entering on it. They had\r\ntaken into their alliance the Parliaments also, who were led, by very\r\nsingular circumstances, to espouse, for the first time, the rights of\r\nthe nation. They had from old causes had personal hostility against M.\r\nde Calonnes. They refused to register his laws or his taxes, and went so\r\nfar as to acknowledge they had no power to do it. They persisted in this\r\nwith his successor, who therefore exiled them. Seeing that the nation\r\ndid not interest themselves much for their recall, they began to fear\r\nthat the new judicatures proposed in their place would be established\r\nand that their own suppression would be perpetual. In short, they found\r\ntheir own strength insufficient to oppose that of the King. They therefore\r\ninsisted that the States General should be called. Here they became\r\nunited with and supported by the Patriots, and their joint influence was\r\nsufficient to produce the promise of that assembly. I always suspected\r\nthat the archbishops had no objections to this force under which they\r\nlaid him. But the Patriots and Parliament insisted it was their efforts\r\nwhich extorted the promise against his will. The re-establishment of the\r\nParliament was the effect of the same coalition between the Patriots and\r\nParliament; but, once re-established, the latter began to see danger in\r\nthat very power, the States General, which they had called for in a moment\r\nof despair, but which they now foresaw might very possibly abridge their\r\npowers. They began to prepare grounds for questioning their legality, as\r\na rod over the head of the States, and as a refuge if they should really\r\nextend their reformations to them. Mr. Neckar came in at this period\r\nand very dexterously disembarrassed the administration of these disputes\r\nby calling the notables to advise the form of calling and constituting\r\nthe States. The court was well disposed towards the people, not from\r\nprinciples of justice or love to them; but they want money. No more can\r\nbe had from the people. They are squeezed to the last drop. The clergy\r\nand nobles, by their privileges and influence, have kept their property\r\nin a great measure untaxed hitherto. They then remain to be squeezed, and\r\nno agent is powerful enough for this but the people. The court therefore\r\nmust ally itself with the people. But the Notables, consisting mostly\r\nof privileged characters, had proposed a method of composing the States,\r\nwhich would have rendered the voice of the people, or Tiers Etats, in the\r\nStates General, inefficient for the purpose of the court. It concurred\r\nthen with the Patriots in intriguing with the Parliament to get them to\r\npass a vote in favor of the rights of the people. This vote, balancing\r\nthat of the Notables, has placed the court at liberty to follow its own\r\nviews, and they have determined that the Tiers Etat shall have in the\r\nStates General as many votes as the clergy and nobles put together. Still\r\na great question remains to be decided, that is, shall the States General\r\nvote by orders, or by persons? precedents are both ways. The clergy will\r\nmove heaven and earth to obtain the suffrage by orders, because that\r\nparries the effect of all hitherto done for the people. The people will\r\nprobably send their deputies expressly instructed to consent to no tax,\r\nto no adoption of the public debts, unless the unprivileged part of the\r\nnation has a voice equal to that of the privileged; that is to say, unless\r\nthe voice of the Tiers Etat be equalled to that of the clergy and nobles.\r\nThey will have the young noblesse in general on their side, and the King\r\nand court. Against them will be the ancient nobles and the clergy. So\r\nthat I hope, upon the whole, that by the time they meet, there will be\r\na majority of the nobles themselves in favor of the Tiers Etat. So far\r\nhistory. We are now to come to prophecy; for you will ask, to what will\r\nall this lead? I answer, if the States General do not stumble at the\r\nthreshold on the question before stated, and which must be decided before\r\nthey can proceed to business, then they will in their first session easily\r\nobtain, 1. Their future periodical convocation of the States. 2. Their\r\nexclusive right to raise and appropriate money which includes that of\r\nestablishing a civil list. 3. A participation in legislation; probably\r\nat first, it will only be a transfer to them of the portion of it now\r\nexercised by parliament, that is to say, a right to propose amendments\r\nand a negative. But it must infallibly end in a right of origination. 4.\r\nPerhaps they may make a declaration of rights. It will be attempted at\r\nleast. Two other objects will be attempted, viz., a habeas corpus law\r\nand a free press. But probably they may not obtain these in the first\r\nsession, or with modifications only, and the nation must be left to ripen\r\nitself more for their unlimited adoption. Upon the whole, it has appeared\r\nto me that the basis of the present struggle is an illumination of the\r\npublic mind as to the rights of the nation, aided by fortunate incidents;\r\nthat they can never retrograde, but from the natural progress of things,\r\nmust press forward to the establishment of a constitution which shall\r\nassure to them a good degree of liberty. They flatter themselves they\r\nshall form a better constitution than the English. I think it will be\r\nbetter in some points--worse in others. It will be better in the article\r\nof representation, which will be more equal. It will be worse, as their\r\nsituation obliges them to keep up the dangerous machine of a standing\r\narmy. I doubt, too, whether they will obtain the trial by jury, because\r\nthey are not sensible of its value.\r\n\r\nI am sure I have by this time heartily tired you with this long epistle,\r\nand that you will be glad to see it brought to an end, with assurances of\r\nthe sentiments of esteem and respect with which I have the honor to be,\r\ndear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, January 11, 1789.\r\n\r\nSIR,--My last letters were of the 14th, 19th and 29th of November, by\r\nthe way of London. The present will go the same way, through a private\r\nchannel.\r\n\r\nAll military operations in Europe seem to have been stopped, by the\r\nexcessive severity of the weather. In this country, it is unparalleled in\r\nso early a part of the winter, and in duration, having continued since\r\nthe middle of November, during which time, it has been as low as nine\r\ndegrees below nought, that is to say, forty degrees below freezing, by\r\nFahrenheit's thermometer; and it has increased the difficulties of the\r\nadministration here. They had, before, to struggle with the want of money,\r\nand want of bread for the people, and now, the want of fuel for them, and\r\nwant of employment. The siege of Oczakow is still continued, the soldiers\r\nsheltering themselves in the Russian manner, in subterraneous barracks;\r\nand the Captain Pacha has retired with his fleet. The death of the King\r\nof Spain has contributed, with the insanity of the English King, to render\r\nproblematical, the form which the affairs of Europe will ultimately take.\r\nSome think a peace possible between the Turks and the two Empires, with\r\nthe cession of Crimea to the former, as less important to Russia than\r\nPoland, which she is in danger of losing. In this case, the two Empires\r\nmight attack the King of Prussia, and the scene of war be only changed. He\r\nis certainly uneasy at the accident happened to his principal ally. There\r\nseems no doubt, but that the Prince of Wales will be sole regent; but it\r\nis also supposed, they will not give him the whole executive power, and\r\nparticularly, that of declaring war without the consent of the parliament.\r\nShould his personal dispositions, therefore, and that of a new ministry,\r\nbe the same which the King had, of co-operating with Prussia, yet the\r\nlatter cannot count on their effect. Probably, the parliament will not\r\nconsent to war, so that I think we may consider the two great powers of\r\nFrance and England as absolutely at rest for some time.\r\n\r\nAs the character of the Prince of Wales is becoming interesting, I have\r\nendeavored to learn what it truly is. This is less difficult in his case,\r\nthan in that of other persons of his rank, because he has taken no pains\r\nto hide himself from the world. The information I most rely on, is from\r\na person here with whom I am intimate, who divides his time between Paris\r\nand London, an Englishman by birth, of truth, sagacity and science. He is\r\nof a circle, when in London, which has had good opportunities of knowing\r\nthe Prince; but he has also, himself, had special occasions of verifying\r\ntheir information, by his own personal observation. He happened, when\r\nlast in London, to be invited to a dinner of three persons. The Prince\r\ncame by chance, and made the fourth. He ate half a leg of mutton; did\r\nnot taste of small dishes, because small; drank Champagne and Burgundy,\r\nas small beer during dinner, and Bourdeaux after dinner, as the rest\r\nof the company. Upon the whole, he ate as much as the other three, and\r\ndrank about two bottles of wine without seeming to feel it. My informant\r\nsat next him, and being till then unknown to the Prince, personally,\r\n(though not by character,) and lately from France, the Prince confined\r\nhis conversation almost entirely to him. Observing to the Prince that he\r\nspoke French without the least foreign accent, the Prince told him, that\r\nwhen very young, his father had put only French servants about him, and\r\nthat it was to that circumstance he owed his pronunciation. He led him\r\nfrom this to give an account of his education, the total of which was the\r\nlearning a little Latin. He has not a single element of Mathematics, of\r\nNatural or Moral Philosophy, or of any other science on earth, nor has the\r\nsociety he has kept been such as to supply the void of education. It has\r\nbeen that of the lowest, the most illiterate and profligate persons of\r\nthe kingdom, without choice of rank or mind, and with whom the subjects\r\nof conversation are only horses, drinking-matches, bawdy houses, and\r\nin terms the most vulgar. The young nobility, who begin by associating\r\nwith him, soon leave him, disgusted with the insupportable profligacy\r\nof his society; and Mr. Fox, who has been supposed his favorite, and\r\nnot over-nice in the choice of company, would never keep his company\r\nhabitually. In fact, he never associated with a man of sense. He has not\r\na single idea of justice, morality, religion, or of the rights of men, or\r\nany anxiety for the opinion of the world. He carries that indifference\r\nfor fame so far, that he would probably not be hurt were he to lose\r\nhis throne, provided he could be assured of having always meat, drink,\r\nhorses, and women. In the article of women, nevertheless, he is become\r\nmore correct, since his connection with Mrs. Fitzherbert, who is an honest\r\nand worthy woman: he is even less crapulous than he was. He had a fine\r\nperson, but it is becoming coarse. He possesses good native common sense;\r\nis affable, polite, and very good humored. Saying to my informant, on\r\nanother occasion, \"your friend, such a one, dined with me yesterday, and\r\nI made him damned drunk;\" he replied, \"I am sorry for it; I had heard that\r\nyour royal highness had left off drinking:\" the Prince laughed, tapped him\r\non the shoulder very good naturedly, without saying a word, or ever after\r\nshowing any displeasure. The Duke of York, who was for some time cried up\r\nas the prodigy of the family, is as profligate, and of less understanding.\r\nTo these particular traits, from a man of sense and truth, it would be\r\nsuperfluous to add the general terms of praise or blame, in which he is\r\nspoken of by other persons, in whose impartiality and penetration I have\r\nless confidence. A sample is better than a description. For the peace of\r\nEurope, it is best that the King should give such gleamings of recovery,\r\nas would prevent the regent or his ministry from thinking themselves firm,\r\nand yet, that he should not recover.\r\n\r\nThis country advances with a steady pace towards the establishment of\r\na constitution, whereby the people will resume the great mass of those\r\npowers, so fatally lodged in the hands of the King. During the session of\r\nthe Notables, and after their votes against the rights of the people, the\r\nparliament of Paris took up the subject, and passed a vote in opposition\r\nto theirs (which I send you). This was not their genuine sentiment; it\r\nwas a manœuvre of the young members, who are truly well disposed, taking\r\nadvantage of the accidental absence of many old members, and bringing\r\nothers over by the clause, which, while it admits the negative of the\r\nStates General in legislation, reserves still to the parliament the\r\nright of enregistering, that is to say, another negative. The Notables\r\npersevered in their opinion. The Princes of the blood, (Monsieur and the\r\nDuke d'Orleans excepted,) presented and published a memoir, threatening a\r\nscission. The parliament were proposing to approve of that memoir, (by way\r\nof rescinding their former vote,) and were prevented from it by the threat\r\nof a young member to impeach (_denoncer_) the memoir and the Princes who\r\nsigned it. The vote of the Notables, therefore, remaining balanced by\r\nthat of the Parliament, the voice of the nation becoming loud and general\r\nfor the rights of the Tiers Etat, a strong probability that if they were\r\nnot allowed one half the representation, they would send up their members\r\nwith express instructions to agree to no tax and to no adoption of the\r\npublic debts, and the court really wishing to give them a moiety of the\r\nrepresentation, this was decided on ultimately. You are not to suppose\r\nthat these dispositions of the court proceed from any love of the people,\r\nor justice towards their rights. Courts love the people always, as wolves\r\ndo the sheep. The fact is this. The court wants money. From the Tiers\r\nEtat they cannot get it, because they are already squeezed to the last\r\ndrop. The clergy and the nobles, by their privileges and their influence,\r\nhave hitherto screened their property in a great degree, from public\r\ncontribution. That half of the orange then, remains yet to be squeezed,\r\nand for this operation there is no agent powerful enough, but the people.\r\nThey are, therefore, brought forward as the favorites of the court, and\r\nwill be supported by them. The moment of crisis will be the meeting of\r\nthe States; because their first act will be, to decide whether they shall\r\nvote by persons or by orders. The clergy will leave nothing unattempted to\r\nobtain the latter; for they see that the spirit of reformation will not\r\nconfine itself to the political, but will extend to the ecclesiastical\r\nestablishment also. With respect to the nobles, the younger members are\r\ngenerally for the people, and the middle aged are daily coming over to the\r\nsame side; so that by the time the States meet, we may hope there will be\r\na majority of that body also in favor of the people, and consequently for\r\nvoting by persons, and not by orders.\r\n\r\nYou will perceive, by the report of Mr. Neckar, (in the gazette of\r\nFrance,) 1, a renewal of the renunciation of the power of imposing a\r\nnew tax by the King, and a like renunciation of the power of continuing\r\nany old one; 2, an acknowledgment that the States are to appropriate the\r\npublic moneys, which will go to the binding the court to a civil list;\r\n3, a consent to the periodical meeting of the States; 4, to consider of\r\nthe restrictions of which _lettres de cachet_ are susceptible; 5, the\r\ndegree of liberty to be given to the press; 6, a bill of rights; and 7,\r\nthere is a passage which looks towards the responsibility of ministers.\r\nNothing is said of communicating to them a share in the legislation. The\r\nministry, perhaps, may be unwilling to part with this, but it will be\r\ninsisted on in the States. The letters of convocation will not appear\r\ntill towards the latter end of the month: neither time nor place are yet\r\ndeclared, but Versailles is talked of, and we may well presume that some\r\ntime in April will be fixed on. In the meantime, Mr. Neckar gets money to\r\nkeep the machine in motion. Their funds rose slowly, but steadily, till\r\nwithin these few days, when there was a small check. However, they stand\r\nvery well, and will rise. The _caisse d'escompte_ lent the government\r\ntwenty-five millions, two days ago. The navy of this country sustained\r\na heavy loss lately, by the death of the Bailli de Suffrein. He was\r\nappointed Generalissimo of the Atlantic, when war was hourly expected\r\nwith England, and is certainly the officer on whom the nation would have\r\nreposed its principal hopes, in such a case. We just now hear of the death\r\nof the Speaker of the House of Commons, before the nomination of a regent,\r\nwhich adds a new embarrassment to the re-establishment of government in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nSince writing mine of November the 29th, yours of the 23d of September\r\nhas come to hand. As the General of the Mathurins was to be employed\r\nin the final redemption of our captives, I thought that their previous\r\nsupport had better be put into his hands, and conducted by himself in\r\nsuch a way as not to counterwork his plan of redemption, whenever we can\r\nenable him to begin on it. I gave him full powers as to the amount and\r\nmanner of subsisting them. He has undertaken it, informing me, at the\r\nsame time, that it will be on a very low scale, to avoid suspicion of\r\nits coming from the public. He spoke of but three sous a day per man,\r\nas being sufficient for their physical necessaries, more than which, he\r\nthinks it not advisable to give. I have no definitive answer yet from\r\nour bankers, whether we may count on the whole million last agreed to\r\nbe borrowed, but I have no doubt of it, from other information, though I\r\nhave not their formal affirmative. The gazettes of Leyden and France to\r\nthis date, accompany this. I have the honor to be, with sentiments of the\r\nmost perfect esteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, January 12, 1789.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My last to you was of the 18th of November; since which, I\r\nhave received yours of the 21st of September and October the 8th, with the\r\npamphlet on the Mohicon language, for which, receive my thanks. I endeavor\r\nto collect all the vocabularies I can, of the American Indians, as of\r\nthose of Asia, persuaded, that if they ever had a common parentage, it\r\nwill appear in their languages.\r\n\r\nI was pleased to see the vote of Congress, of September the 16th, on the\r\nsubject of the Mississippi, as I had before seen, with great uneasiness,\r\nthe pursuits of other principles, which I could never reconcile to my\r\nown ideas of probity or wisdom, and from which, and my knowledge of the\r\ncharacter of our western settlers, I saw that the loss of that country\r\nwas a necessary consequence. I wish this return to true policy, may\r\nbe in time to prevent evil. There has been a little foundation for the\r\nreports and fears relative to the Marquis de La Fayette. He has, from the\r\nbeginning, taken openly part with those who demand a constitution; and\r\nthere was a moment that we apprehended the Bastile; but they ventured on\r\nnothing more, than to take from him a temporary service, on which he had\r\nbeen ordered; and this, more to save appearances for their own authority,\r\nthan anything else; for at the very time they pretended that they had put\r\nhim into disgrace, they were constantly conferring and communicating with\r\nhim. Since this, he has stood on safe ground, and is viewed as among the\r\nforemost of the patriots. Everybody here is trying their hand at forming\r\ndeclarations of rights. As something of that kind is going on with you\r\nalso, I send you two specimens from hence. The one is by our friend of\r\nwhom I have just spoken. You will see that it contains the essential\r\nprinciples of ours, accommodated as much as could be, to the actual state\r\nof things here. The other is from a very sensible man, a pure theorist,\r\nof the sect called the economists, of which Turgot was considered as the\r\nhead. The former is adapted to the existing abuses, the latter goes to\r\nthose possible, as well as to those existing.\r\n\r\nWith respect to Dr. Spence, supposed to have been taken by the Algerines,\r\nI think the report extremely improbable. O'Bryan, one of our captives\r\nthere, has constantly written to me, and given me information on every\r\nsubject he thought interesting. He could not have failed to know if such\r\na capture had been made, though before his time, nor to inform me of it.\r\nI am under perpetual anxiety for our captives there. The money, indeed, is\r\nnot yet ready at Amsterdam; but when it shall be, there are no orders from\r\nthe board of treasury to the bankers, to furnish what may be necessary for\r\nthe redemption of the captives; and it is so long since Congress approved\r\nthe loan, that the orders of the treasury for the application of the money\r\nwould have come, if they had intended to send any. I wrote to them early\r\non the subject, and pointedly. I mentioned it to Mr. Jay also, merely that\r\nhe might suggest it to them. The payments to the foreign officers, will\r\nawait the same formality.\r\n\r\nI thank you for your attention to the case of Mrs. Burke. We have no\r\nnews of Dr. Franklin since July last, when he was very ill. Though the\r\nsilence of our letters on that subject is a proof that he is well, yet\r\nthere is an anxiety here among his friends. We have lately had three books\r\npublished, which are of great merit, in different lines. The one is in\r\nseven volumes, octavo, by an Abbé Barthelemy, wherein he has collected\r\nevery subject of Grecian literature, after a labor of thirty years. It is\r\ncalled \"_Les voyages d'Anacharsis_.\" I have taken a copy for you, because\r\nthe whole impression was likely to be run off at once. The second is a\r\nwork on government, by the Marquis de Condorcet, two volumes, octavo. I\r\nshall secure you a copy. The third are the works of the King of Prussia,\r\nin sixteen volumes, octavo. These were a little garbled at Berlin, before\r\nprinted. The government lays its hands on all which come here, and change\r\nsome leaves. There is a genuine edition published at Balse, where even the\r\ngarblings of Berlin are re-established. I doubt the possibility of getting\r\na copy, so vigilant is the government as to this work. I shall obtain\r\nyou one, if it be possible. As I write all the public news to Mr. Jay, I\r\nwill not repeat it to you. I have just received the Flora Caroliniana of\r\nWalter, a very learned and good work. I am, with very sincere esteem and\r\nrespect, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, January 14, 1789.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In my letter of the 11th, I have said nothing of the _Arret_\r\nexplanatory of that of September the 28th, on the subject of whale oils,\r\nwhich my letter of November the 19th gave you reason to expect. Though\r\nthis explanatory _Arret_ has been passed so long ago as the 7th of\r\nDecember, it has not been possible for me to obtain an authentic copy of\r\nit, till last night. I now enclose that to you, with a copy of a letter\r\nto me from Mr. Neckar, on the subject. The reception of our oils, in the\r\nmeantime, is provided for by an intermediate order. You will observe,\r\nthat in the _Arret_ it is said to be passed \"provisoirement,\" and that\r\nMr. Neckar expressly holds up to us in his letter, a repeal, whenever\r\nthe national fishery supplies their wants. The _Arret_, however, is not\r\nlimited in its duration, and we have several chances against its repeal.\r\nIt may be questioned, whether Mr. Neckar thinks the fishery worth the\r\nexpense. It may be well questioned, whether, either with or without\r\nencouragement, the nation whose navigation is the least economical of\r\nall in Europe, can ever succeed in the whale fishery, which calls for the\r\nmost rigorous economy. It is hoped that a share in the legislation will\r\npass immediately into the hands of the States General, so as to be no\r\nlonger in the power of the _commis_ of a bureau, or even of his minister\r\nto smuggle a law through, unquestioned; and we may even hope that the\r\nnational demand for this oil will increase faster than both their and our\r\nfisheries together will supply. But in spite of all these hopes, if the\r\nEnglish should find means to cover their oils under our name, there will\r\nbe great danger of a repeal. It is essential, then, that our government\r\ntake effectual measures to prevent the English from obtaining genuine sea\r\npapers, that they enable their consuls in the ports of France (as soon as\r\nthey shall be named) to detect counterfeit papers, and that we convince\r\nthis government that we use our best endeavors with good faith, as it is\r\nclearly our interest to do; for the rivalship of the English, is the only\r\none we have to fear. It had already begun to render our oils invendible in\r\nthe ports of France. You will observe that Mr. Neckar renews the promise\r\nof taking off the ten sous _pour_ livre, at the end of the next year.\r\n\r\nOczakow is at length taken by assault. The assailants were fourteen\r\nthousand, and the garrison twelve thousand, of whom seven thousand were\r\ncut to pieces before they surrendered. The Russians lost three thousand\r\nmen. This is the Russian version, of which it is safe to believe no part,\r\nbut that Oczakow is taken. The speaker of the English House of Commons,\r\nhaving died suddenly, they have chosen Mr. Grenville, a young man of\r\ntwenty-seven years of age. This proves that Mr. Pitt is firm with the\r\npresent parliament.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, January 14, 1789.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I now do myself the pleasure to enclose to you a copy of\r\nthe _Arret_ explanatory of that of September 28th, on the subject of\r\nour whale oils. Mr. Neckar in a letter to me has reserved the promise\r\nof taking off the ten sous per livre at the end of the next year. But,\r\nat the same time, he observes that whenever the national fishery shall\r\nbe able to supply their demand for whale oil, we must expect a repeal\r\nof this _Arret_, which therefore expresses itself to be _provisory_.\r\nHowever, their navigation being the most expensive in Europe, they are\r\nthe least likely to succeed in a whale fishery, without encouragements\r\nmore extravagant than even those they now give; and it remains to be seen\r\nwhether Mr. Neckar will continue to give even the present. I am informed\r\nthere will be fewer French adventurers the next year than there has\r\nbeen this; so that if there be an apparent increase of their fishery, it\r\nwill be by drawing over more of our fishermen. It is probable the States\r\nGeneral will obtain a participation in the legislation, which will render\r\ntheir laws more stable, and more to be relied on. Mr. Neckar has also\r\npromised that if the present _Arret_ should at any time be repealed,\r\nthere shall be a sufficient space of time allowed for the reception of\r\nthe oils which shall have been previously embarked. But our principal,\r\nif not our only danger, of a repeal being brought on, will come from the\r\nendeavors of the English to introduce their oils under color of ours,\r\nperhaps even with the assistance of our own merchants. Some effectual\r\nmeans must be adopted to prevent them from getting our real ship papers,\r\nand our Consuls in the ports of France must be enabled to detect forged\r\npapers; and we must moreover convince this government that we use our\r\nutmost endeavors, and with good faith, to prevent the entry of English\r\noils under the license given to us. I would advise our shippers of oil\r\nalways to get the certificate of the French consul in their State, if\r\nit be practicable, because those will admit of the least doubt here.\r\nWhen this cannot be had, they may have recourse to the magistrates of\r\nthe country, and in this case there should be a certificate under the\r\nseal of the State, that the magistrate who has certified their oil to be\r\nthe produce of the American fishery, is a magistrate duly appointed and\r\nqualified by law, all the States for the Governors' signature to accompany\r\nthe great seal. Oczakow is at length taken. The Russians say they gave\r\nthe assault with fourteen thousand men, against twelve thousand within\r\nthe walls, that seven thousand of these suffered themselves to be cut to\r\npieces before they surrendered, and that themselves lost three thousand.\r\nThe only circumstance to be believed in all this, is that Oczakow is\r\ntaken. Everything else in Europe is quiet, except the internal affairs\r\nof Poland. The Prussian party there gains greater superiority daily. The\r\nKing of Prussia, however, will feel less bold on the probability that\r\nEngland will remain inactive in all things external. This secures to this\r\ncountry leisure for their internal improvements. These go on well. The\r\nreport of Mr. Neckar to the King, which has been published, renews the\r\nrenunciation of the power of laying a new tax or continuing an old one\r\nwithout consent of the States General; admits they are to appropriate the\r\npublic moneys (and of course how much of it the King may spend), that\r\nministers must be responsible, that the King will concur in fixing the\r\nperiodical meeting of the States, that he will be ready to consider with\r\nthem what modifications, _lettres de cachet_ should be put under, and of\r\nthe decree of liberty which may be given to the press; and further, that\r\nall this shall be fixed by a convention so solemn as that his successor\r\nshall not be free to infringe it; that is to say, that he will concur in\r\na declaration of rights. Nothing is said, however, of the States sharing\r\nin the legislation, but they will surely be passed. They have given to the\r\nTiers Etat a representation in the States equal to both the other orders,\r\nand it is probably they will form but one house and vote by persons; but\r\nthat is not decided. Be so good as to present me affectionately to Mrs.\r\nAdams, and to be assured yourself, of the sincere esteem of, dear Sir,\r\nyour friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MADAME NECKAR.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, January 24, 1789.\r\n\r\nI have received, Madam, with a great deal of sensibility, the letter of\r\nthe 22d instant, with which you were pleased to honor me, on the claims\r\nof Monsieur Klein against the United States; and immediately endeavored\r\nto inform myself of their foundation, by an examination of the journals\r\nof Congress. Congress, consisting of many persons, can only speak by the\r\norgan of their records. If they have any engagements, they are to be found\r\nthere. If not found there, they can never have existed. I proceeded to\r\nthis examination, with all the partialities which were naturally inspired\r\nby the interest you are so good as to take in his behalf, the desire of\r\ndoing what will be agreeable to you, and a disposition to obtain for him\r\nthe justice which might be his due. I have extracted, literally, from\r\nthose journals, everything I find in them on his subject, and I take the\r\nliberty of enclosing you those extracts. From them, as well as from what I\r\nrecollect of the ordinary train of business about the years 1778 and 1779,\r\nI presume the following to be very nearly the history of Monsieur Klein's\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nCongress were generally desirous of adding to their army during the war.\r\nAmong other methods attempted, it was usual for foreigners (multitudes\r\nof whom went to ask command), when they found there was no vacancy,\r\nto propose to raise troops themselves, on condition they should have\r\ncommissions to command them. I suppose that Messrs. Klein, Fearer and\r\nKleinsmit (named in the resolution of Congress of 1788, and whom, from\r\ntheir names, I conjecture to be Germans), offered to enlist a body of men\r\nfrom among the German prisoners taken with General Burgoyne at Saratoga,\r\non condition that Fearer and Kleinsmit should be captains over them, and\r\nKlein, lieutenant colonel. Three months seem to have been allowed them\r\nfor raising their corps. However, at the end of ten months it seems they\r\nhad engaged but twenty-four men, and that all of these, except five, had\r\ndeserted. Congress, therefore, put an end to the project, June the 21st,\r\n1779 (and not in July, 1780, as Monsieur Klein says), by informing him\r\nthey had no farther use for his services, and giving him a year's pay\r\nand subsistence to bring him to Europe. He chose to stay there three\r\nand a half longer, as he says, to solicit what was due to him. Nothing\r\ncould ever have been due to him, but pay and subsistence for the ten\r\nmonths he was trying to enlist men, and the donation of a year's pay and\r\nsubsistence; and it is not probable he would wait three years and a half\r\nto receive these. I suppose he has staid in hopes of finding some other\r\nopening for employment. If these articles of pay and subsistence have not\r\nbeen paid to him, he has the certificates of the paymaster and commissary\r\nto prove it; because it was an invariable rule, when demands could not be\r\npaid, to give the party a certificate, to establish the sum due to him. If\r\nhe has not such a certificate, it is a proof he has been paid. If he has\r\nit, he can produce it, and, in that case, I will undertake to represent\r\nhis claim to our government, and will answer for their justice.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to correct several inaccuracies in the letter of Monsieur\r\nKlein, such as that Congress _engaged_ to give him a regiment; that he\r\npaid the recruiting money _out of his own pocket_; that his soldiers had\r\n_nothing but bread and water_; that Congress had promised him they would\r\npay his soldiers in _specie_, &c.; some of which are impossible, and\r\nothers very improbable; but these would be details too lengthy, Madam,\r\nfor you to be troubled with. Klein's object is to be received at the\r\nhospital of invalids. I presume he is not of the description of persons\r\nentitled to be received there, and that his American commission and\r\nAmerican grievances, are the only ground he has whereon to raise a claim\r\nto reception. He has, therefore, tried to make the most of them. Few think\r\nthere is any immorality in scandalizing governments or ministers; and M.\r\nKlein's distresses render this resource more innocent in him than it is in\r\nmost others.\r\n\r\nYour commands, Madam, to give what information I could, have drawn thus\r\nmuch from me. I would not wish to weaken the hopes he so justly rests\r\non your known goodness and benevolence. On the contrary, the weaker his\r\nclaim elsewhere, the stronger they will plead in your bosom to procure him\r\nrelief; and whatever may be done for him here, I repeat it, that if he has\r\nany just demand against the United States, and will furnish me with proofs\r\nof it, I will solicit it with zeal, and, I trust, with effect. To procure\r\nhim justice will be one gratification, and a great additional one will\r\nbe, that he has procured me the occasion of offering you my portion of the\r\ngeneral tribute so justly due for all the good you have done, and all you\r\nare perpetually endeavoring to do. Accept then, Madam, I pray you, this\r\nhomage from one whose motives are pure truth and justice, when he assures\r\nyou of the sincerity of those sentiments of esteem and respect with\r\nwhich he has the honor to be, Madam, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, February 4, 1789.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of November the 25th, by Gouverneur Morris, is duly\r\nreceived. I must beg you to take the trouble of deciphering yourself what\r\nfollows, and to communicate it to nobody but the President, at least for\r\nthe present.\r\n\r\nWe had before understood, through different channels, that the conduct\r\nof the Count de Moustier was politically and morally offensive. It\r\nwas delicate for me to speak on the subject to the Count de Montmorin.\r\nThe invaluable mediation of our friend, the Marquis de La Fayette, was\r\ntherefore resorted to, and the subject explained, though not pressed.\r\nLater intelligence showing the necessity of pressing it, it was yesterday\r\nresumed, and represented through the same medium to the Count de\r\nMontmorin, that recent information proved to us, that his minister's\r\nconduct had rendered him personally odious in America, and might even\r\ninfluence the dispositions of the two nations; that his recall was become\r\na matter of mutual concern; that we had understood he was instructed\r\nto remind the new government of their debt to this country, and that\r\nhe was in the purpose of doing it in very harsh terms; that this could\r\nnot increase their desire of hastening payment, and might wound their\r\naffections; that, therefore, it was much to be desired that his discretion\r\nshould not be trusted to, as to the form in which the demand should be\r\nmade, but that the letter should be written here, and he instructed to\r\nadd nothing but his signature; nor was his private conduct omitted. The\r\nCount de Montmorin was sensibly impressed. He very readily determined\r\nthat the letter should be formed here, but said that the recall was a\r\nmore difficult business; that as they had no particular fact to allege\r\nagainst the Count de Moustier, they could not recall him from that\r\nministry without giving him another, and there was no vacancy at present.\r\nHowever, he would hazard his first thoughts on the subject, saving the\r\nright of correcting them by further consideration. They were these: that\r\nthere was a loose expression in one of de Moustier's letters, which might\r\nbe construed into a petition for leave of absence; that he would give\r\nhim permission to return to France; that it had been before decided, on\r\nthe request of the Marquis de La Luzerne, that Otto should go to him to\r\nLondon; that they would send a person to America as chargé des affaires\r\nin place of Otto, and that if the President (General Washington) approved\r\nof him, he should be afterwards made minister. He had cast his eye on\r\nColonel Ternant, and desired the Marquis to consult me whether he would\r\nbe agreeable. At first I hesitated, recollecting to have heard Ternant\r\nrepresented in America as an hypochondriac, discontented man, and paused\r\nfor a moment between him and Barthelemy, at London, of whom I have heard\r\na great deal of good. However, I concluded it safer to take one whom\r\nwe knew, and who knew us. The Marquis was decidedly of this opinion.\r\nTernant will see that his predecessor is recalled for unconciliatory\r\ndeportment, and that he will owe his own promotion to the approbation of\r\nthe President. He established a solid reputation in Europe, by his conduct\r\nwhen Generalissimo of one of the United Provinces, during their late\r\ndisturbances; and it is generally thought, that if he had been put at the\r\nhead of the principal province, instead of the Rhingrave de Salm, he would\r\nhave saved that cause. Upon the whole, I believe you may expect that the\r\nCount de Moustier will have an immediate leave of absence, which will soon\r\nafter become a recall in effect. I will try, also, to have the consuls\r\nadmonished as to the line of conduct they should observe. I shall have the\r\nhonor of writing you a general letter within a few days. I have now that\r\nof assuring you of the sentiment of sincere esteem and respect, with which\r\nI am, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                                   PARIS, February 9, 1789.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you last on the 22d of January, on which day I\r\nreceived yours of December the 31st, and since that, the other of January\r\nthe 14th. We have now received news from America down to the middle\r\nof December. They had then had no cold weather. All things relative\r\nto our new Constitution were going on well. Federal senators are; New\r\nHampshire, President Langdon and Bartlett. Massachusetts, Strong and\r\nDalton. Connecticut, Dr. Johnson and Ellsworth. New Jersey, Patterson\r\nand Ellmer. Pennsylvania, Robert Morris and McClay. Delaware, Reed and\r\nBassett. Virginia, Richard Henry Lee and Grayson. Maryland, Charles\r\nCarroll of Carrolton, and John Henry. All of these are federalists except\r\nthose of Virginia; so that a majority of federalists are secured in the\r\nSenate, and expected in the House of Representatives. General Washington\r\nwill be President, and probably Mr. Adams Vice President. So that the\r\nConstitution will be put under way by those who will give it a fair trial.\r\nIt does not seem probable that the attempt of New York to have another\r\nconvention to make amendments, will succeed, though Virginia concurs in\r\nit. It is tolerably certain that Congress will propose amendments to the\r\nAssemblies, as even the friends of the Constitution are willing to make\r\namendments; some from a conviction they are necessary, others, from a\r\nspirit of conciliation. The addition of a bill of rights, will, probably,\r\nbe the most essential change. A vast majority of anti-federalists have got\r\ninto the Assembly of Virginia, so that Mr. Henry is omnipotent there. Mr.\r\nMadison was left out as a senator by eight or nine votes; and Henry has so\r\nmodelled the districts for representatives, as to tack Orange to counties\r\nwhere himself has great influence, that Madison may not be elected into\r\nthe lower federal House, which was the place he had wished to serve in,\r\nand not the Senate. Henry pronounced a philippic against Madison in open\r\nAssembly, Madison being then at Philadelphia. Mifflin is President of\r\nPennsylvania, and Peters, Speaker. Colonel Howard is Governor of Maryland.\r\nBeverly Randolph, Governor of Virginia; (this last is said by a passenger\r\nonly, and he seems not very sure,) Colonel Humphreys is attacked in the\r\npapers for his French airs, for bad poetry, bad prose, vanity, &c. It is\r\nsaid his dress, in so gay a style, gives general disgust against him. I\r\nhave received a letter from him. He seems fixed with General Washington.\r\nMayo's bridge, at Richmond, was completed, and carried away in a few\r\nweeks. While up, it was so profitable that he had great offers for it.\r\nA turnpike is established at Alexandria, and succeeds. Rhode Island\r\nhas again refused to call a convention. Spain has granted to Colonel\r\nMorgan, of New Jersey, a vast tract of land on the western side of the\r\nMississippi, with the monopoly of the navigation of that river. He is\r\ninviting settlers, and they swarm to him. Even the settlement of Kentucky\r\nis likely to be much weakened by emigrations to Morgan's grant. Warville\r\nhas returned, charmed with our country. He is going to carry his wife\r\nand children to settle there. Gouverneur Morris has just arrived here;\r\ndeputed, as is supposed, to settle Robert Morris' affairs, which continue\r\nstill deranged. Doctor Franklin was well when he left America, which was\r\nabout the middle of December.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI send Mr. Rutledge two letters by the post. Be so good as to present him\r\nmy esteem, and to be assured yourself of the sincere esteem and attachment\r\nwith which I am, and shall ever be, dear Sir, your affectionate friend and\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE VILLEDEUIL.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, February 10, 1789.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I take the liberty of troubling your Excellency with the following\r\ncase, which I understand to be within your department. Mr. Jay, Secretary\r\nfor Foreign Affairs to the United States of America, having occasion to\r\nsend me despatches of great importance, and by a courier express, confided\r\nthem to a Mr. Nesbitt, who offered himself in that character. He has\r\ndelivered them safely; but, in the moment of delivering them, explained\r\nto me his situation, which is as follows. He was established in commerce\r\nat L'Orient during the war. Losses by shipwreck, by capture, and by the\r\nconclusion of the peace at a moment when he did not expect it, reduced\r\nhim to bankruptcy, and he returned to America, without the consent of his\r\ncreditors, to make the most of his affairs there. He has been employed\r\nin this ever since, and now wishing to see his creditors, and to consult\r\nthem on their mutual interests, he availed himself of Mr. Jay's demand\r\nfor a courier, to come under the safe conduct of that character to Paris,\r\nwhere he flattered himself he might obtain that of your Excellency, for\r\nthe purpose of seeing his creditors, settling and arranging with them.\r\nHe thinks a twelve-month will be necessary for this. Understanding that\r\nit is not unusual to grant safe conducts in such cases, and persuaded it\r\nwill be for the benefit of his creditors, I take the liberty of enclosing\r\nhis memoir to your Excellency, and of soliciting your favorable attention\r\nto it, assured that it will not be denied him, if it be consistent with\r\nthe established usage; and if inadmissible, praying that your Excellency\r\nwill have the goodness to give me as early an answer as the other\r\narduous occupations in which you are engaged will admit, in order that\r\nhe may know whether he may see his creditors, or must return without. I\r\nam encouraged to trouble your Excellency with this application, by the\r\ngoodness with which you have been pleased to attend to our interests on\r\nformer occasions, and by the desire of availing myself of every occasion\r\nof proffering to you the homage of those sentiments of attachment and\r\nrespect, with which I have the honor to be, your Excellency's most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                                  PARIS, February 28, 1789.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you last on the 9th instant. Yours of the 11th,\r\ncame to hand yesterday evening. Some of its enquiries will have already\r\nbeen answered to you. We have no information from America down to the\r\nmiddle of January. Things were going on so well that our letters afford\r\nnothing interesting scarcely. The opposition to the new Constitution\r\ngrows feebler. Everywhere the elections are federal. In New York they\r\nhad not yet been able to agree in the choice of senators, nor even in\r\nthe manner of choosing. The new government begins on Wednesday next.\r\nIts friends consent to some changes, and particularly to the annexation\r\nof a declaration of rights. This will probably be proposed by Congress\r\nto the several assemblies, and thus a new convention be avoided. The\r\nVirginia Assembly met October 23. They choose for their speaker, Thomas\r\nMathews, (who is this?) They are furiously anti-federal. They have passed\r\na bill rendering every person holding any federal office incapable of\r\nholding at the same time any State office. This is a declaration of war\r\nagainst the new Constitution. Mr. Adams is generally expected to be the\r\nVice-President. Hancock is his only competitor. Others are sometimes\r\ntalked of, but not with their own consent. I see in a Virginia paper of\r\nlast summer, that George Nicholas advertised his departure to settle\r\nin Kentucky this present month of February. Great numbers of American\r\nvessels are now arriving in the ports of France with flour and wheat, in\r\nconsequence of the demand of this country and of the bounty it gives. I\r\nhave received a letter from Ladian, dated Grand Cairo, September 10. He\r\nwas just then about to plunge into the terræ incognitæ of Africa. This\r\nmorning, I received one from Admiral Paul Jones, dated St. Petersburg,\r\nJanuary 30, he was just arrived there at the desire of the Empress. He has\r\ncommanded hitherto on the Black Sea, but does not know whether the Empress\r\ndestines him to return there or to take any other command.\r\n\r\nThere has been an affray in Britanny between the Noblesse and people, in\r\nwhich some few were killed. Things there are now quiet, and all the rest\r\nof the kingdom is going on well towards its object. In some places, as\r\nin Burgundy and Franche-compte, there is an opposition by the Noblesse\r\nindeed against the manifest sense of the nation, but I do not apprehend\r\nany serious evil from it. The States General are likely to meet under\r\nhappy auspices. It would seem that the government thinks they will end\r\nwell, because I observe in their communications with certain unfriendly\r\ncourts they assume a tone which had been laid aside for some time. Their\r\neffects stand well. * * * * The King of England seems to be in a state\r\nof convalescence. The symptoms of a return of reason are such that on\r\nthe 19th instant the House of Lords put off the reading of the Regency\r\nbill, and it is even thought there will be no regency, nor any change of\r\nministry. There are not yet sufficient data to ground a judgment whether\r\nthere will be peace or not between the Turks and the two empires, nor what\r\npart Russia will take in the affairs of Poland. The preparations of Sweden\r\nand Denmark so far announce a continuation of the war. You have heard,\r\ndoubtless, of the revolution which took place in Geneva about the last\r\nof January. It was the work of three or four days only, and with little\r\nbloodshed their ancient constitution is almost completely re-established.\r\nTheir exiles are to be recalled, the foreign garrison sent off, the\r\nBourgeois guard the city, and the nomination of the Syndics is restored\r\nto the council of two hundred. I see no reason to doubt the permanence\r\nof this reformation. Here all your acquaintances are well. I continue to\r\nkeep my house and on such terms as will induce me to keep it as long as\r\nI remain in Europe. I fear my departure in the spring may be retarded,\r\nas Governeur Morris tells me there would be no probability that the old\r\nCongress would re-assemble. In this case I cannot receive my leave of\r\nabsence from the new government. I have proposed to them the naming you\r\n_Chargé des Affaires_ to take care of their business during my absence.\r\nYou know that we must not be too sanguine on these occasions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. BANCROFT.\r\n\r\n                                                      PARIS, March 2, 1789.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have just received a letter of January 31st from Admiral Paul\r\nJones, at Petersburg, in which, charging me with the execution of some\r\ncommissions, and these requiring money, he tells me you will answer my\r\ndrafts to the amount of four or five thousand livres, on his account. Be\r\nso good as to inform me whether you will pay such drafts.\r\n\r\nA Monsieur Foulloy, who has been connected with Deane, lately offered me\r\nfor sale two volumes of Deane's letter books and account books, that he\r\nhad taken instead of money, which Deane owed him. I have purchased them\r\non public account. He tells me Deane has still six or eight volumes more,\r\nand being to return soon to London, he will try to get them also, in\r\norder to make us pay high for them. You are sensible of the impropriety\r\nof letting such books get into hands which might make an unfriendly use\r\nof them. You are sensible of the immorality of an ex-minister's selling\r\nhis secrets for money; and consequently that there can be no immorality\r\nin tempting him with money to part with them; so that they may be restored\r\nto that government to whom they properly belong. Your former acquaintance\r\nwith Deane may, perhaps, put it in your power to render our country\r\nthe service of recovering those books. It would not do to propose it\r\nto him as for Congress. What other way would best bring it about, you\r\nknow best. I suppose his distresses and his crapulous habits, will not\r\nrender him difficult on this head. On the supposition that there are six\r\nor eight volumes, I think you might venture as far as fifty guineas,\r\nand proportionably for fewer. I will answer your draft to this amount\r\nand purpose, or you may retain it out of any moneys you may propose to\r\npay me for Admiral Jones. There is no time to lose in this negotiation,\r\nas, should Foulloy arrive there before it is closed, he will spoil the\r\nbargain. If you should be able to recover these books, I would ask the\r\nfavor of you to send them to me by the Diligence, that I may carry them\r\nback with me to America. I make no apology for giving you this trouble. It\r\nis for our common country, and common interest.\r\n\r\nI am, with sincere and great esteem and attachment, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SHIPPEN.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, March 11, 1789.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I had wished to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of\r\nJanuary the 19th, and February the 3d, by a private conveyance, but none\r\nsuch having occurred, nor being likely to occur, I must write you such a\r\nletter as may go through the inspection of both post offices.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of this country are still going on well. There are loud\r\ncontestations indeed in one or two of the provinces, and in Brittany\r\nthese have come to blows, and some three or four or five people have\r\nbeen killed. Still the opposition to the revolution which is working has\r\nbeen miraculously small, and he who would predict of its failure from the\r\nlittle obstacles which have happened, would be about as good a prophet as\r\nhe who, from the loss of two or three skirmishes on our part, would have\r\nforetold our final failure in the American revolution. All the world here\r\nis occupied in electioneering, in choosing or being chosen; and, as far as\r\nParis may be considered as affording a specimen of the public mind, we may\r\nsay it is almost thoroughly ripe for a just decision of the great question\r\nof voting by orders or by persons. The difficulties which now appear\r\nthreatening to my mind, are those which will result from the size of the\r\nAssembly. Twelve hundred persons of any rank and of any nation assembled\r\ntogether, would with difficulty be prevented from tumult and confusion.\r\nBut when they are to compose an assembly for which no rules of debate\r\nor proceeding have been yet formed, in whom no habits of order have been\r\nyet established, and to consist moreover of Frenchmen, among whom there\r\nare always more speakers than listeners, I confess to you I apprehend\r\nsome danger. However, I still hope that the goodness of the body, and the\r\ncoolness and collectedness of some of their leaders, will keep them in the\r\nright way, and that this great Assembly will end happily.\r\n\r\nThe war in the north will, I think, continue, and perhaps spread as far as\r\nPrussia. The present and probable situation of the Executive in England,\r\nwill, I presume, prevent their engaging otherwise than by giving money.\r\nIf so, this country will certainly not engage herself the present year,\r\nand after the present year, if her States General pass over well, she will\r\nbe in a condition to do what she pleases. I have lately received a letter\r\nfrom Admiral Paul Jones, dated at Petersburg, about the last of January.\r\nHe was just arrived there on the call of the Empress, and uninformed where\r\nhe was to act the ensuing campaign. We have no news from America later\r\nthan the 10th of January, when things were going on well. I find that\r\nthe friends of the new Constitution are generally disposed to make such\r\nchanges as may be requisite to guard liberty. This will probably reconcile\r\nthe bulk of the opposition. Nothing would be more agreeable to me than\r\nyour company on our voyage to Virginia, and I am sorry I am unable to give\r\nsuch an idea of the epoch of it, as might enable you to decide whether it\r\nsuited you. Governeur Morris, who is here, informs me that not only there\r\nwas no Congress when he came away, but that none was expected till the\r\nnew government. My letters asking leave of absence were not then arrived,\r\nand consequently I cannot have that leave but from the new government,\r\nnor expect that even they will take it up among their first subjects.\r\nThis renders the time of my receiving permission uncertain, and should it\r\nbe so late as that I cannot go, do my business there, and return in the\r\nfall, I shall prefer postponing my departure hence to the fall, so that\r\nI may return in the spring, being quite decided against a winter passage.\r\nYou see, therefore, my dear Sir, the impossibility of my fixing the epoch\r\nof my departure. Pray continue to me during your stay your interesting\r\npolitical information, and accept assurances of the esteem and respect\r\nwith which I am, dear Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, March 12, 1789.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I had the honor of addressing you on the 1st instant, through the\r\npost. I write the present, uncertain whether Mr. Nesbitt, the bearer of\r\nyour last, will be the bearer of this, or whether it may not have to wait\r\nsome other private occasion. They have re-established their packet-boats\r\nhere indeed; but they are to go from Bourdeaux, which, being between four\r\nand five hundred miles from hence, is too far to send a courier with any\r\nletters but on the most extraordinary occasions; and without a courier,\r\nthey must pass through the post office. I shall, therefore, not make use\r\nof this mode of conveyance, but prefer sending my letters by a private\r\nhand, by the way of London. The uncertainty of finding private conveyances\r\nto London, is the principal objection to this.\r\n\r\nOn the receipt of your letter, advising me to purchase the two volumes\r\nof Deane's letters and accounts, I wrote to the person who had them, and\r\nafter some offers and refusals, he let me have them for twenty-five louis,\r\ninstead of twenty louis asked at first. He told me that Deane had still\r\nsix or eight volumes more, and that when he should return to London, he\r\nwould try to get them, in order to make himself whole for the money he had\r\nlent Deane. As I knew he would endeavor to make us pay dear for them, and\r\nit appeared to be your opinion and that of the members you had consulted,\r\nthat it was an object worthy attention, I wrote immediately to a friend in\r\nLondon, to endeavor to purchase them from Deane himself, whose distresses\r\nand crapulous habits will probably render him more easy to deal with. I\r\nauthorized him to go as far as fifty guineas. I have as yet no answer from\r\nhim. I enclose you a letter which I wrote last month to our bankers in\r\nHolland. As it will itself explain the cause of its being written, I shall\r\nnot repeat its substance here. In answer to my proposition, to pay bills\r\nfor the medals and the redemption of our captives, they quote a resolution\r\nof Congress (which, however, I did not find in the printed journals)\r\nappropriating the loans of 1787 and 1788 to the payment of interest on\r\nthe Dutch loans till 1790, inclusive, and the _residue_ to salaries and\r\ncontingencies in Europe, and they argue that, according to this, they\r\nare not to pay anything in Europe, till they shall first have enough to\r\npay all the interest which will become due to the end of the year 1790;\r\nand that it is out of personal regard, that they relax from this so far\r\nas to pay diplomatic salaries. So that here is a clear declaration they\r\nwill answer no other demands, till they have in hand money enough for all\r\nthe interest to the end of the year 1790. It is but a twelvemonth since I\r\nhave had occasion to pay attention to the proceedings of those gentlemen;\r\nbut during that time, I have observed, that as soon as a sum of interest\r\nis becoming due, they are able to borrow just that, and no more; or, at\r\nleast, only so much more as may pay our salaries and keep us quiet. Were\r\nthey not to borrow for the interest, the failure to pay that would sink\r\nthe value of the capital, of which they are considerable sharers. So far,\r\ntheir interests and ours concur. But there, perhaps, they may separate.\r\nI think it possible, they may choose to support our credit to a certain\r\npoint, and let it go no further, but at their will; to keep it so poised,\r\nas that it may be at their mercy. By this, they may be sure to keep us\r\nin their own hands. They write word to the treasury, that in order to\r\nraise money for the February interest, they were obliged to agree with\r\nthe subscribers, that Congress should open no other loan at Amsterdam\r\nthis year, till this one be filled up, and that this shall not be filled\r\nbut by the present subscribers, and they not obliged to fill it. This\r\nis delivering us, bound hand and foot, to the subscribers, that is, to\r\nthemselves. Finding that they would not raise money for any other purpose,\r\nwithout being pushed, I wrote the letter I enclose you. They answer, as I\r\nhave stated, by refusing to pay, alleging the appropriation of Congress.\r\nI have written again, to press them further, and to propose to them the\r\npayment of thirty thousand florins only, for the case of our captives,\r\nas I am in hopes this may do. In the close of my letter to them, you will\r\nobserve I refer them, as to the article of foreign officers, to the board\r\nof treasury. I had, in truth, received the printed journals a few days\r\nbefore, but had not yet had time to read them carefully, and particularly\r\nhad not then noted the vote of Congress of August the 20th, directing me\r\nto attend to that article. I shall not fail to do what I can in it; but I\r\nam afraid they will consider this also as standing on the same ground with\r\nthe other contingent articles.\r\n\r\nThis country, being generally engaged in its elections, affords nothing\r\nnew and worthy of communication. The hopes of accommodation between Turkey\r\nand the two empires, do not gain strength. The war between Russia and\r\nDenmark on the one hand, and Sweden on the other, is likely also to go on,\r\nthe mediation of England being rendered of little force by the accident\r\nto its Executive. The progress of this war, and also of the broils in\r\nPoland, may possibly draw the King of Prussia into it, during the ensuing\r\ncampaign; and it must, before it be finished, take in this country,\r\nand perhaps England. The ill humor on account of the Dutch revolution\r\ncontinues to rankle here. They have recalled their ambassador from the\r\nHague, and manifestly to show their dissatisfaction with that court, and\r\nsome very dry memorials have lately been exchanged, on the subject of the\r\nmoney this country assumed to pay the Emperor, for the Dutch. I send you\r\nvery full extracts of these, which will show you the dispositions of the\r\ntwo courts towards each other. Whether, and when this country will be able\r\nto take an active part, will depend on the issue of the States General. If\r\nthey fund their public debts judiciously, and will provide further funds\r\nfor a war, on the English plan, I believe they will be able to borrow any\r\nsums they please. In the meantime, the situation of England will leave\r\nthem at leisure to settle their internal affairs well. That ministry,\r\nindeed, pretend their King is perfectly re-established. No doubt they will\r\nmake the most of his amendment, which is real, to a certain degree. But\r\nas, under pretence of this, they have got rid of the daily certificates of\r\nthe physicians, and they are possessed of the King's person, the public\r\nmust judge hereafter from such facts only as they can catch. There are\r\nseveral at present which, put together, induce a presumption that the King\r\nis only better, not well. And should he be well, time will be necessary to\r\ngive a confidence, that it is not merely a lucid interval. On the whole,\r\nI think we may conclude, that that country will not take a part in the war\r\nthis year, which was by no means certain before.\r\n\r\nM. del Pinto, formerly minister of Portugal at London, and the same who\r\nnegotiated the treaty with us, being now put at the head of the ministry\r\nof that country, I presume that negotiation may be renewed successfully,\r\nif it be the desire of our government. Perhaps an admission of our flour\r\ninto their ports may be obtained now, as M. del Pinto seemed impressed\r\nwith our reasoning on that subject, and promised to press it on his court,\r\nthough he could not then venture to put it into the treaty. There is not\r\nthe same reason to hope any relaxation as to our reception in Brazil,\r\nbecause he would scarcely let us mention that at all. I think, myself,\r\nthat it is their interest to take away all temptations to our co-operation\r\nin the emancipation of their colonies: and I know no means of doing this,\r\nbut the making it our interest that they should continue dependent, nor\r\nany other way of making this our interest, but by allowing us a commerce\r\nwith them. However, this is a mode of reasoning which their ministry,\r\nprobably, could not bear to listen to.\r\n\r\nI send herewith the gazettes of France and Leyden, and have the honor to\r\nbe, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO F. HOPKINSON.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, March 13, 1789.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Since my last, which was of December the 21st, yours of\r\nDecember the 9th and 21st are received. Accept my thanks for the papers\r\nand pamphlets which accompanied them, and mine and my daughter's, for\r\nthe book of songs. I will not tell you how much they have pleased us,\r\nnor how well the last of them merits praise for its pathos, but relate a\r\nfact only, which is, that while my elder daughter was playing it on the\r\nharpsichord, I happened to look towards the fire, and saw the younger one\r\nall in tears. I asked her if she was sick? She said \"no; but the tune was\r\nso mournful.\"\r\n\r\nThe Editor of the Encyclopedie has published something as to an advanced\r\nprice on his future volumes, which, I understand, alarms the subscribers.\r\nIt was in a paper which I do not take, and therefore I have not yet seen\r\nit, nor can I say what it is. I hope that by this time you have ceased to\r\nmake wry faces about your vinegar, and that you have received it safe and\r\ngood. You say that I have been dished up to you as an anti-federalist,\r\nand ask me if it be just. My opinion was never worthy enough of notice\r\nto merit citing; but since you ask it, I will tell it to you. I am not a\r\nfederalist, because I never submitted the whole system of my opinions to\r\nthe creed of any party of men whatever, in religion, in philosophy, in\r\npolitics or in anything else, where I was capable of thinking for myself.\r\nSuch an addiction, is the last degradation of a free and moral agent. If\r\nI could not go to heaven but with a party, I would not go there at all.\r\nTherefore, I am not of the party of federalists. But I am much farther\r\nfrom that of the anti-federalists. I approved, from the first moment,\r\nof the great mass of what is in the new Constitution; the consolidation\r\nof the government; the organization into executive, legislative, and\r\njudiciary; the subdivision of the legislative; the happy compromise of\r\ninterests between the great and little States, by the different manner of\r\nvoting in the different Houses; the voting by persons instead of States;\r\nthe qualified negative on laws given to the executive, which, however,\r\nI should have liked better if associated with the judiciary also, as in\r\nNew York; and the power of taxation. I thought at first that the latter\r\nmight have been limited. A little reflection soon convinced me it ought\r\nnot to be. What I disapproved from the first moment also, was the want\r\nof a bill of rights, to guard liberty against the legislative as well\r\nas the executive branches of the government; that is to say, to secure\r\nfreedom in religion, freedom of the press, freedom from monopolies,\r\nfreedom from unlawful imprisonment, freedom from a permanent military,\r\nand a trial by jury, in all cases determinable by the laws of the land.\r\nI disapproved, also, the perpetual re-eligibility of the President. To\r\nthese points of disapprobation I adhere. My first wish was, that the nine\r\nfirst conventions might accept the constitution, as the means of securing\r\nto us the great mass of good it contained, and that the four last might\r\nreject it, as the means of obtaining amendments. But I was corrected in\r\nthis wish, the moment I saw the much better plan of Massachusetts, and\r\nwhich had never occurred to me. With respect to the declaration of rights,\r\nI suppose the majority of the United States are of my opinion; for I\r\napprehend, all the anti-federalists and a very respectable proportion of\r\nthe federalists, think that such a declaration should now be annexed. The\r\nenlightened part of Europe have given us the greatest credit for inventing\r\nthe instrument of security for the rights of the people, and have been\r\nnot a little surprised to see us so soon give it up. With respect to the\r\nre-eligibility of the President, I find myself differing from the majority\r\nof my countrymen; for I think there are but three States out of the eleven\r\nwhich have desired an alteration of this. And indeed, since the thing\r\nis established, I would wish it not to be altered during the life of our\r\ngreat leader, whose executive talents are superior to those, I believe,\r\nof any man in the world, and who, alone, by the authority of his name and\r\nthe confidence reposed in his perfect integrity, is fully qualified to put\r\nthe new government so under way, as to secure it against the efforts of\r\nopposition. But, having derived from our error all the good there was in\r\nit, I hope we shall correct it, the moment we can no longer have the same\r\nname at the helm.\r\n\r\nThese, my dear friend, are my sentiments, by which you will see I was\r\nright in saying I am neither federalist nor anti-federalist; that I am\r\nof neither party, nor yet a trimmer between parties. These, my opinions,\r\nI wrote within a few hours after I had read the Constitution, to one or\r\ntwo friends in America. I had not then read one single word printed on\r\nthe subject. I never had an opinion in politics or religion, which I was\r\nafraid to own. A costive reserve on these subjects might have procured me\r\nmore esteem from some people, but less from myself. My great wish is, to\r\ngo on in a strict but silent performance of my duty; to avoid attracting\r\nnotice, and to keep my name out of newspapers, because I find the pain\r\nof a little censure, even when it is unfounded, is more acute than the\r\npleasure of much praise. The attaching circumstance of my present office,\r\nis, that I can do its duties unseen by those for whom they are done.\r\nYou did not think, by so short a phrase in your letter, to have drawn on\r\nyourself such an egotistical dissertation. I beg your pardon for it, and\r\nwill endeavor to merit that pardon by the constant sentiments of esteem\r\nand attachment with which I am, dear Sir, your sincere friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY COUNT DE MOUSTIER.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, March 13, 1789.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have now to acknowledge the honor of your several letters\r\nof Aug. 12th, Oct. 17th, and Nov. 27th, and your postscript to Madame\r\nde Brehan's of Dec. 29th. I have been discouraged from writing to\r\nyou by the idea that your friends here must give you infinitely more\r\nexact information of what is passing, than I could do, who see things\r\nimperfectly only, as a stranger. But your complaints of the inexactitude\r\nof your friends in this point, will induce me hereafter to hazard more\r\nfreely my communications, however imperfect. The affairs of this country\r\ngo on more auspiciously than the most sanguine could have expected.\r\nThe difficulties of procuring money, and of preventing a bankruptcy,\r\ncontinue always at such a point as to leave the administration no\r\nresource but that of an appeal to the nation, and the nation, availing\r\nitself of their advantageous position, presses on sufficiently to obtain\r\nreasonable concessions, and yet not so much as to endanger an appeal to\r\narms. In fact, the King is altogether out of the dispute. He has said he\r\nis ready to agree to such and such articles, and the dispute is between\r\nthe privileged and unprivileged orders, how they shall divide these\r\nconcessions between them. An equal taxation is agreed to by everybody;\r\nthe only question is on the mode of voting; and even in this I think\r\nthere is already a majority of the nobles in favor of voting by persons.\r\nShould this be the case, and should it be found practicable to organize so\r\nnumerous a body as twelve hundred, so as to avoid tumult, we may hope a\r\nhappy issue from the approaching convocation. One of their great objects\r\nwill be to fund the public debts, and if this operation be judiciously\r\nexecuted, and their expenses reduced within the limits of their revenue,\r\nI see nothing to prevent their possessing the first credit in Europe,\r\nand being, of course, in a condition to enter on the stage again more\r\nrespectably than they ever yet did. But they must be left in quiet this\r\nyear at least. Longer still would be still better. The present situation\r\nof the antagonist nation is favorable to the necessary repose of this\r\ncountry. It is impossible that England can venture to engage itself in\r\na war this year. Were the King as well as his ministry untruly pretend\r\nhim to be, time is necessary to give a confidence in his recovery, and\r\nto show that it is not merely a lucid interval. In the meanwhile, the\r\nglimmerings of accommodation between the Turks and two empires do not grow\r\nstronger. On the other hand, the war in the western parts of Europe will\r\nvery possibly spread farther. The accident in England has benumbed her\r\nmediation between the Swedes and Danes, so that their war will probably go\r\non, and, with the disturbances in Poland, may draw in the King of Prussia.\r\nThis will so embroil matters, that it is impossible they should clear\r\nup but by a general war, in which France, if not England, must sooner or\r\nlater take a part. Your ambassador at the Hague is recalled, and certainly\r\non account of the ill-humor between this Court and that. Some very dry and\r\nunfriendly memorials have passed between them on the subject of the money\r\nwhich was to have been paid by this country for the late peace with the\r\nEmperor. These things suffice to show that France nourishes a resentment\r\nstill of the treatment she has received, and to keep alive well-grounded\r\napprehensions at the Hague that all is not done yet. Should there be a\r\npossibility of detaching the Turks from the war, so as to leave the two\r\nempires free to turn this way, or should England remain inactive, the\r\ncontest in which this country may be engaged will not be difficult; but\r\nif the Turks, English, Dutch, Prussians, Poles and Swedes are all in\r\nactivity, they will give warm employment to the two empires, France, Spain\r\nand Denmark, in the event of the war becoming general.\r\n\r\nAll the world here is electioneering. Paris is a desert, at least as to\r\nthat description of persons who think they may be chosen themselves, or\r\naid the choice of their friends. I hope to see this great meeting before\r\nmy departure. Several elections are already over, but I am not able to\r\ngive you a list of them. Mirabeau has been declared in his province not\r\nto be a noble, whereupon he offered himself for the people, and it is said\r\nhe is elected. The D. de Orleans has lately rendered himself very popular\r\nby decided declarations in favor of the Tiers Etat in all their points. He\r\nhas particularly declared he will pay taxes in proportion to his property,\r\nand he has relinquished all his Capitaineries. His daughter is to be\r\nmarried to the D. de Angouleme. The Dauphin is at the last extremity.\r\nHe is lately removed from Versailles to Meudon. This is considered as\r\npreparatory to a removal to St. Dennis. We have had such a winter here\r\nas is not on record. The mercury was 18½ below freezing on Reaumur's\r\nscale, and I think it was nearly two months varying between that point and\r\nzero. It gave occasion for a display of the benevolent character of this\r\nnation, which, great as I had thought it, went beyond my expectations.\r\nThere seems to be a very general apprehension of the want of bread this\r\nspring. Supplies are hoped from our country, and indeed they have already\r\nreduced the price of flour at Bordeaux from 36_l._ to 33_l._ the barrel.\r\nThe funds, at a low ebb when Mr. Necker came in, recovered their ground\r\nby degrees, and have ever since remained stationary. The Court has had\r\nthoughts of coming to St. Cloud during the session of the States, but it\r\nis not yet decided. As I shall write to Madame de Brehan, I shall tender\r\nmy respects to her myself. The next details I give you will be in New\r\nYork, where I hope to have the pleasure of seeing you in the summer, and\r\nof taking your orders for France. In the meantime, I am, with very sincere\r\nesteem and respect, dear Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MADAME DE BREHAN.\r\n\r\n                                                     PARIS, March 14, 1789.\r\n\r\nDEAR MADAM,--I had the honor of writing to you on the 15th of February;\r\nsoon after which, I had the honor of receiving your favor of December the\r\n29th. I have a thousand questions to ask you about your journey to the\r\nIndian treaty, how you like their persons, their manners, their costumes,\r\n_cuisine_, &c. But this I must defer till I can do it personally in New\r\nYork, where I hope to see you for a moment in the summer, and to take\r\nyour commands for France. I have little to communicate to you from this\r\nplace. It is deserted; everybody being gone into the country to choose\r\nor be chosen deputies to the States General. I hope to see that great\r\nmeeting before my departure. It is to be on the 27th of next month. A\r\ngreat political revolution will take place in your country, and that\r\nwithout bloodshed. A King with two hundred thousand men at his orders,\r\nis disarmed by the force of the public opinion and the want of money.\r\nAmong the economies becoming necessary, perhaps one may be the opera.\r\nThey say it has cost the public treasury an hundred thousand crowns the\r\nlast year. A new theatre is established since your departure; that of the\r\nOpera Buffons, where Italian operas are given, and good music. It is in\r\nthe Chateau des Tuilleries. Paris is every day enlarging and beautifying.\r\nI do not count among its beauties, however, the wall with which they\r\nhave enclosed us. They have made some amends for this, by making fine\r\nboulevards within and without the walls. These are in considerable\r\nforwardness, and will afford beautiful rides round the city, of between\r\nfifteen and twenty miles in circuit. We have had such a winter, Madam, as\r\nmakes me shiver yet, whenever I think of it. All communications, almost,\r\nwere cut off. Dinners and suppers were suppressed, and the money laid\r\nout in feeding and warming the poor, whose labors were suspended by the\r\nrigor of the season. Loaded carriages passed the Seine on the ice, and\r\nit was covered with thousands of people from morning to night, skating\r\nand sliding. Such sights were never seen before, and they continued\r\ntwo months. We have nothing new and excellent in your charming art of\r\npainting. In fact, I do not feel an interest in any pencil but that\r\nof David. But I must not hazard details on a subject wherein I am so\r\nignorant, and you such a connoisseur. Adieu, my dear Madam; permit me\r\nalways the honor of esteeming and being esteemed by you, and of tendering\r\nyou the homage of that respectful attachment with which I am, and shall\r\never be, dear Madam, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX TO VOL.
