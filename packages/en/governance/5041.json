Kennedy\r\nJanuary 30, 1961\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of the Congress:\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasure to return from whence I came. You are among my oldest\r\nfriends in Washington--and this House is my oldest home. It was here, more\r\nthan 14 years ago, that I first took the oath of Federal office. It was\r\nhere, for 14 years, that I gained both knowledge and inspiration from\r\nmembers of both parties in both Houses--from your wise and generous\r\nleaders--and from the pronouncements which I can vividly recall, sitting\r\nwhere you now sit--including the programs of two great Presidents, the\r\nundimmed eloquence of Churchill, the soaring idealism of Nehru, the\r\nsteadfast words of General de Gaulle. To speak from this same historic\r\nrostrum is a sobering experience. To be back among so many friends is a\r\nhappy one.\r\n\r\nI am confident that that friendship will continue. Our Constitution wisely\r\nassigns both joint and separate roles to each branch of the government; and\r\na President and a Congress who hold each other in mutual respect will\r\nneither permit nor attempt any trespass. For my part, I shall withhold from\r\nneither the Congress nor the people any fact or report, past, present, or\r\nfuture, which is necessary for an informed judgment of our conduct and\r\nhazards. I shall neither shift the burden of executive decisions to the\r\nCongress, nor avoid responsibility for the outcome of those decisions.\r\n\r\nI speak today in an hour of national peril and national opportunity. Before\r\nmy term has ended, we shall have to test anew whether a nation organized\r\nand governed such as ours can endure. The outcome is by no means certain.\r\nThe answers are by no means clear. All of us together--this Administration,\r\nthis Congress, this nation--must forge those answers.\r\n\r\nBut today, were I to offer--after little more than a week in\r\noffice--detailed legislation to remedy every national ill, the Congress\r\nwould rightly wonder whether the desire for speed had replaced the duty of\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nMy remarks, therefore, will be limited. But they will also be candid. To\r\nstate the facts frankly is not to despair the future nor indict the past.\r\nThe prudent heir takes careful inventory of his legacies, and gives a\r\nfaithful accounting to those whom he owes an obligation of trust. And,\r\nwhile the occasion does not call for another recital of our blessings and\r\nassets, we do have no greater asset than the willingness of a free and\r\ndetermined people, through its elected officials, to face all problems\r\nfrankly and meet all dangers free from panic or fear.\r\n\r\n                                   I.\r\n\r\nThe present state of our economy is disturbing. We take office in the wake\r\nof seven months of recession, three and one-half years of slack, seven\r\nyears of diminished economic growth, and nine years of falling farm\r\nincome.\r\n\r\nBusiness bankruptcies have reached their highest level since the Great\r\nDepression. Since 1951 farm income has been squeezed down by 25 percent.\r\nSave for a brief period in 1958, insured unemployment is at the highest\r\npeak in our history. Of some five and one-half million Americans who are\r\nwithout jobs, more than one million have been searching for work for more\r\nthan four months. And during each month some 150,000 workers are exhausting\r\ntheir already meager jobless benefit rights.\r\n\r\nNearly one-eighth of those who are without jobs live almost without hope\r\nin nearly one hundred especially depressed and troubled areas. The rest\r\ninclude new school graduates unable to use their talents, farmers forced to\r\ngive up their part-time jobs which helped balance their family budgets,\r\nskilled and unskilled workers laid off in such important industries as\r\nmetals, machinery, automobiles and apparel.\r\n\r\nOur recovery from the 1958 recession, moreover, was anemic and incomplete.\r\nOur Gross National Product never regained its full potential. Unemployment\r\nnever returned to normal levels. Maximum use of our national industrial\r\ncapacity was never restored.\r\n\r\nIn short, the American economy is in trouble. The most resourceful\r\nindustrialized country on earth ranks among the last in the rate of\r\neconomic growth. Since last spring our economic growth rate has actually\r\nreceded. Business investment is in a decline. Profits have fallen below\r\npredicted levels. Construction is off. A million unsold automobiles are in\r\ninventory. Fewer people are working--and the average work week has shrunk\r\nwell below 40 hours. Yet prices have continued to rise--so that now too\r\nmany Americans have less to spend for items that cost more to buy.\r\n\r\nEconomic prophecy is at best an uncertain art--as demonstrated by the\r\nprediction one year ago from this same podium that 1960 would be, and I\r\nquote, \"the most prosperous year in our history.\" Nevertheless, forecasts\r\nof continued slack and only slightly reduced unemployment through 1961 and\r\n1962 have been made with alarming unanimity--and this Administration does\r\nnot intend to stand helplessly by.\r\n\r\nWe cannot afford to waste idle hours and empty plants while awaiting the\r\nend of the recession. We must show the world what a free economy can do--to\r\nreduce unemployment, to put unused capacity to work, to spur new\r\nproductivity, and to foster higher economic growth within a range of sound\r\nfiscal policies and relative price stability.\r\n\r\nI will propose to the Congress within the next 14 days measures to improve\r\nunemployment compensation through temporary increases in duration on a\r\nself-supporting basis--to provide more food for the families of the\r\nunemployed, and to aid their needy children--to redevelop our areas of\r\nchronic labor surplus--to expand the services of the U.S. Employment\r\nOffices--to stimulate housing and construction--to secure more purchasing\r\npower for our lowest paid workers by raising and expanding the minimum\r\nwage--to offer tax incentives for sound plant investment--to increase the\r\ndevelopment of our natural resources--to encourage price stability--and to\r\ntake other steps aimed at insuring a prompt recovery and paving the way for\r\nincreased long-range growth. This is not a partisan program concentrating\r\non our weaknesses--it is, I hope, a national program to realize our\r\nnational strength.\r\n\r\n                                  II.\r\n\r\nEfficient expansion at home, stimulating the new plant and technology that\r\ncan make our goods more competitive, is also the key to the international\r\nbalance of payments problem. Laying aside all alarmist talk and panicky\r\nsolutions, let us put that knotty problem in its proper perspective.\r\n\r\nIt is true that, since 1958, the gap between the dollars we spend or\r\ninvest abroad and the dollars returned to us has substantially widened.\r\nThis overall deficit in our balance of payments increased by nearly $11\r\nbillion in the 3 years--and holders of dollars abroad converted them\r\nto gold in such a quantity as to cause a total outflow of nearly $5\r\nbillion of gold from our reserve. The 1959 deficit was caused in large\r\npart by the failure of our exports to penetrate foreign markets--the\r\nresult both of restrictions on our goods and our own uncompetitive\r\nprices. The 1960 deficit, on the other hand, was more the result of an\r\nincrease in private capital outflow seeking new opportunity, higher\r\nreturn or speculative advantage abroad.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile this country has continued to bear more than its share of the\r\nWest's military and foreign aid obligations. Under existing policies,\r\nanother deficit of $2 billion is predicted for 1961--and individuals in\r\nthose countries whose dollar position once depended on these deficits for\r\nimprovement now wonder aloud whether our gold reserves will remain\r\nsufficient to meet our own obligations.\r\n\r\nAll this is cause for concern--but it is not cause for panic. For our\r\nmonetary and financial position remains exceedingly strong. Including our\r\ndrawing rights in the International Monetary Fund and the gold reserve held\r\nas backing for our currency and Federal Reserve deposits, we have some $22\r\nbillion in total gold stocks and other international monetary reserves\r\navailable--and I now pledge that their full strength stands behind the\r\nvalue of the dollar for use if needed.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we hold large assets abroad--the total owed this nation far\r\nexceeds the claims upon our reserves--and our exports once again\r\nsubstantially exceed our imports.\r\n\r\nIn short, we need not--and we shall not--take any action to increase the\r\ndollar price of gold from $35 an ounce--to impose exchange controls--to\r\nreduce our anti-recession efforts--to fall back on restrictive trade\r\npolicies--or to weaken our commitments around the world.\r\n\r\nThis Administration will not distort the value of the dollar in any\r\nfashion. And this is a commitment.\r\n\r\nPrudence and good sense do require, however, that new steps be taken to\r\nease the payments deficit and prevent any gold crisis. Our success in world\r\naffairs has long depended in part upon foreign confidence in our ability to\r\npay. A series of executive orders, legislative remedies and cooperative\r\nefforts with our allies will get underway immediately--aimed at attracting\r\nforeign investment and travel to this country--promoting American exports,\r\nat stable prices and with more liberal government guarantees and\r\nfinancing--curbing tax and customs loopholes that encourage undue spending\r\nof private dollars abroad--and (through OECD, NATO and otherwise) sharing\r\nwith our allies all efforts to provide for the common defense of the free\r\nworld and the hopes for growth of the less developed lands. While the\r\ncurrent deficit lasts, ways will be found to ease our dollar outlays abroad\r\nwithout placing the full burden on the families of men whom we have asked\r\nto serve our Flag overseas.\r\n\r\nIn short, whatever is required will be done to back up all our efforts\r\nabroad, and to make certain that, in the future as in the past, the dollar\r\nis as \"sound as a dollar.\"\r\n\r\n                                 III.\r\n\r\nBut more than our exchange of international payments is out of balance.\r\nThe current Federal budget for fiscal 1961 is almost certain to show a\r\nnet deficit. The budget already submitted for fiscal 1962 will remain in\r\nbalance only if the Congress enacts all the revenue measures requested--and\r\nonly if an earlier and sharper up-turn in the economy than my economic\r\nadvisers now think likely produces the tax revenues estimated.\r\nNevertheless, a new Administration must of necessity build on the spending\r\nand revenue estimates already submitted. Within that framework, barring the\r\ndevelopment of urgent national defense needs or a worsening of the economy,\r\nit is my current intention to advocate a program of expenditures which,\r\nincluding revenues from a stimulation of the economy, will not of and by\r\nthemselves unbalance the earlier Budget.\r\n\r\nHowever, we will do what must be done. For our national household is\r\ncluttered with unfinished and neglected tasks. Our cities are being\r\nengulfed in squalor. Twelve long years after Congress declared our goal to\r\nbe \"a decent home and a suitable environment for every American family,\" we\r\nstill have 25 million Americans living in substandard homes. A new housing\r\nprogram under a new Housing and Urban Affairs Department will be needed\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\nOur classrooms contain 2 million more children than they can properly have\r\nroom for, taught by 90,000 teachers not properly qualified to teach. One\r\nthird of our most promising high school graduates are financially unable to\r\ncontinue the development of their talents. The war babies of the 1940's,\r\nwho overcrowded our schools in the 1950's, are now descending in 1960 upon\r\nour colleges--with two college students for every one, ten years from\r\nnow--and our colleges are ill prepared. We lack the scientists, the\r\nengineers and the teachers our world obligations require. We have neglected\r\noceanography, saline water conversion, and the basic research that lies at\r\nthe root of all progress. Federal grants for both higher and public school\r\neducation can no longer be delayed.\r\n\r\nMedical research has achieved new wonders--but these wonders are too often\r\nbeyond the reach of too many people, owing to a lack of income\r\n(particularly among the aged), a lack of hospital beds, a lack of nursing\r\nhomes and a lack of doctors and dentists. Measures to provide health care\r\nfor the aged under Social Security, and to increase the supply of both\r\nfacilities and personnel, must be undertaken this year.\r\n\r\nOur supply of clean water is dwindling. Organized and juvenile crimes cost\r\nthe taxpayers millions of dollars each year, making it essential that we\r\nhave improved enforcement and new legislative safeguards. The denial of\r\nconstitutional rights to some of our fellow Americans on account of\r\nrace--at the ballot box and elsewhere--disturbs the national conscience,\r\nand subjects us to the charge of world opinion that our democracy is not\r\nequal to the high promise of our heritage. Morality in private business\r\nhas not been sufficiently spurred by morality in public business. A host\r\nof problems and projects in all 50 States, though not possible to include\r\nin this Message, deserves--and will receive--the attention of both the\r\nCongress and the Executive Branch. On most of these matters, Messages will\r\nbe sent to the Congress within the next two weeks.\r\n\r\n                                  IV.\r\n\r\nBut all these problems pale when placed beside those which confront us\r\naround the world. No man entering upon this office, regardless of his\r\nparty, regardless of his previous service in Washington, could fail to be\r\nstaggered upon learning--even in this brief 10 day period--the harsh\r\nenormity of the trials through which we must pass in the next four years.\r\nEach day the crises multiply. Each day their solution grows more difficult.\r\nEach day we draw nearer the hour of maximum danger, as weapons spread and\r\nhostile forces grow stronger. I feel I must inform the Congress that our\r\nanalyses over the last ten days make it clear that--in each of the\r\nprincipal areas of crisis--the tide of events has been running out and time\r\nhas not been our friend.\r\n\r\nIn Asia, the relentless pressures of the Chinese Communists menace the\r\nsecurity of the entire area--from the borders of India and South Viet Nam\r\nto the jungles of Laos, struggling to protect its newly-won independence.\r\nWe seek in Laos what we seek in all Asia, and, indeed, in all of the\r\nworld--freedom for the people and independence for the government. And this\r\nNation shall persevere in our pursuit of these objectives.\r\n\r\nIn Africa, the Congo has been brutally torn by civil strife, political\r\nunrest and public disorder. We shall continue to support the heroic\r\nefforts of the United Nations to restore peace and order--efforts which\r\nare now endangered by mounting tensions, unsolved problems, and decreasing\r\nsupport from many member states.\r\n\r\nIn Latin America, Communist agents seeking to exploit that region's\r\npeaceful revolution of hope have established a base on Cuba, only 90 miles\r\nfrom our shores. Our objection with Cuba is not over the people's drive for\r\na better life. Our objection is to their domination by foreign and domestic\r\ntyrannies. Cuban social and economic reform should be encouraged. Questions\r\nof economic and trade policy can always be negotiated. But Communist\r\ndomination in this Hemisphere can never be negotiated.\r\n\r\nWe are pledged to work with our sister Republics to free the Americas of\r\nall such foreign domination and all tyranny, working toward the goal of a\r\nfree hemisphere of free governments, extending from Cape Horn to the Arctic\r\nCircle.\r\n\r\nIn Europe our alliances are unfulfilled and in some disarray. The unity of\r\nNATO has been weakened by economic rivalry and partially eroded by national\r\ninterest. It has not yet fully mobilized its resources nor fully achieved a\r\ncommon outlook. Yet no Atlantic power can meet on its own the mutual\r\nproblems now facing us in defense, foreign aid, monetary reserves, and a\r\nhost of other areas; and our close ties with those whose hopes and\r\ninterests we share are among this Nation's most powerful assets.\r\n\r\nOur greatest challenge is still the world that lies beyond the Cold\r\nWar--but the first great obstacle is still our relations with the Soviet\r\nUnion and Communist China. We must never be lulled into believing that\r\neither power has yielded its ambitions for world domination--ambitions\r\nwhich they forcefully restated only a short time ago. On the contrary, our\r\ntask is to convince them that aggression and subversion will not be\r\nprofitable routes to pursue these ends. Open and peaceful competition--for\r\nprestige, for markets, for scientific achievement, even for men's minds--is\r\nsomething else again. For if Freedom and Communism were to compete for\r\nman's allegiance in a world at peace, I would look to the future with ever\r\nincreasing confidence.\r\n\r\nTo meet this array of challenges--to fulfill the role we cannot avoid on\r\nthe world scene--we must reexamine and revise our whole arsenal of tools:\r\nmilitary, economic and political.\r\n\r\nOne must not overshadow the other. On the Presidential Coat of Arms, the\r\nAmerican eagle holds in his right talon the olive branch, while in his left\r\nhe holds a bundle of arrows. We intend to give equal attention to both.\r\n\r\nFirst, we must strengthen our military tools. We are moving into a period\r\nof uncertain risk and great commitment in which both the military and\r\ndiplomatic possibilities require a Free World force so powerful as to make\r\nany aggression clearly futile. Yet in the past, lack of a consistent,\r\ncoherent military strategy, the absence of basic assumptions about our\r\nnational requirements and the faulty estimates and duplication arising from\r\ninter-service rivalries have all made it difficult to assess accurately how\r\nadequate--or inadequate--our defenses really are.\r\n\r\nI have, therefore, instructed the Secretary of Defense to reappraise our\r\nentire defense strategy--our ability to fulfill our commitments--the\r\neffectiveness, vulnerability, and dispersal of our strategic bases, forces\r\nand warning systems--the efficiency and economy of our operation and\r\norganization--the elimination of obsolete bases and installations--and the\r\nadequacy, modernization and mobility of our present conventional and\r\nnuclear forces and weapons systems in the light of present and future\r\ndangers. I have asked for preliminary conclusions by the end of\r\nFebruary--and I then shall recommend whatever legislative, budgetary or\r\nexecutive action is needed in the light of these conclusions.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I have asked the Defense Secretary to initiate immediately\r\nthree new steps most clearly needed now:\r\n\r\nFirst, I have directed prompt attention to increase our air-lift capacity.\r\nObtaining additional air transport mobility--and obtaining it now--will\r\nbetter assure the ability of our conventional forces to respond, with\r\ndiscrimination and speed, to any problem at any spot on the globe at any\r\nmoment's notice. In particular it will enable us to meet any deliberate\r\neffort to avoid or divert our forces by starting limited wars in widely\r\nscattered parts of the globe.\r\n\r\n(b) I have directed prompt action to step up our Polaris submarine program.\r\nUsing unobligated ship-building funds now (to let contracts originally\r\nscheduled for the next fiscal year) will build and place on station--at\r\nleast nine months earlier than planned--substantially more units of a\r\ncrucial deterrent--a fleet that will never attack first, but possess\r\nsufficient powers of retaliation, concealed beneath the seas, to discourage\r\nany aggressor from launching an attack upon our security.\r\n\r\n(c) I have directed prompt action to accelerate our entire missile program.\r\nUntil the Secretary of Defense's reappraisal is completed, the emphasis\r\nhere will be largely on improved organization and decision-making--on\r\ncutting down the wasteful duplications and the time-lag that have\r\nhandicapped our whole family of missiles. If we are to keep the peace, we\r\nneed an invulnerable missile force powerful enough to deter any aggressor\r\nfrom even threatening an attack that he would know could not destroy enough\r\nof our force to prevent his own destruction. For as I said upon taking the\r\noath of office: \"Only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be\r\ncertain beyond doubt that they will never be employed.\"\r\n\r\nSecondly, we must improve our economic tools. Our role is essential and\r\nunavoidable in the construction of a sound and expanding economy for the\r\nentire non-communist world, helping other nations build the strength to\r\nmeet their own problems, to satisfy their own aspirations--to surmount\r\ntheir own dangers. The problems in achieving this goal are towering and\r\nunprecedented--the response must be towering and unprecedented as well,\r\nmuch as Lend-Lease and the Marshall Plan were in earlier years, which\r\nbrought such fruitful results.\r\n\r\n(a) I intend to ask the Congress for authority to establish a new and more\r\neffective program for assisting the economic, educational and social\r\ndevelopment of other countries and continents. That program must stimulate\r\nand take more effectively into account the contributions of our allies, and\r\nprovide central policy direction for all our own programs that now so often\r\noverlap, conflict or diffuse our energies and resources. Such a program,\r\ncompared to past programs, will require\r\n\r\n--more flexibility for short run emergencies\r\n\r\n--more commitment to long term development--new attention to education at\r\nall levels--greater emphasis on the recipient nation's role, their effort,\r\ntheir purpose, with greater social justice for their people, broader\r\ndistribution and participation by their people and more efficient public\r\nadministration and more efficient tax systems of their own\r\n\r\n--and orderly planning for national and regional development instead of a\r\npiecemeal approach.\r\n\r\nI hope the Senate will take early action approving the Convention\r\nestablishing the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\r\nThis will be an important instrument in sharing with our allies this\r\ndevelopment effort--working toward the time when each nation will\r\ncontribute in proportion to its ability to pay. For, while we are prepared\r\nto assume our full share of these huge burdens, we cannot and must not be\r\nexpected to bear them alone.\r\n\r\nTo our sister republics to the south, we have pledged a new alliance for\r\nprogress--alianza para progreso. Our goal is a free and prosperous Latin\r\nAmerica, realizing for all its states and all its citizens a degree of\r\neconomic and social progress that matches their historic contributions of\r\nculture, intellect and liberty. To start this nation's role at this time in\r\nthat alliance of neighbors, I am recommending the following:\r\n\r\n--That the Congress appropriate in full the $500 million fund pledged by\r\nthe Act of Bogota, to be used not as an instrument of the Cold War, but as\r\na first step in the sound development of the Americas.\r\n\r\n--That a new Inter-Departmental Task Force be established under the\r\nleadership of the Department of State, to coordinate at the highest level\r\nall policies and programs of concern to the Americas.\r\n\r\n--That our delegates to the OAS, working with those of other members,\r\nstrengthen that body as an instrument to preserve the peace and to prevent\r\nforeign domination anywhere in the Hemisphere.\r\n\r\n--That, in cooperation with other nations, we launch a new hemispheric\r\nattack on illiteracy and inadequate educational opportunities to all\r\nlevels; and, finally,\r\n\r\n--That a Food-for-Peace mission be sent immediately to Latin America to\r\nexplore ways in which our vast food abundance can be used to help end\r\nhunger and malnutrition in certain areas of suffering in our own\r\nhemisphere.\r\n\r\nThis Administration is expanding its Food-for-Peace Program in every\r\npossible way. The product of our abundance must be used more effectively to\r\nrelieve hunger and help economic growth in all corners of the globe. And I\r\nhave asked the Director of this Program to recommend additional ways in\r\nwhich these surpluses can advance the interests of world peace--including\r\nthe establishment of world food reserves.\r\n\r\nAn even more valuable national asset is our reservoir of dedicated men and\r\nwomen--not only on our college campuses but in every age group--who have\r\nindicated their desire to contribute their skills, their efforts, and a\r\npart of their lives to the fight for world order. We can mobilize this\r\ntalent through the formation of a National Peace Corps, enlisting the\r\nservices of all those with the desire and capacity to help foreign lands\r\nmeet their urgent needs for trained personnel.\r\n\r\nFinally, while our attention is centered on the development of the non-\r\ncommunist world, we must never forget our hopes for the ultimate freedom\r\nand welfare of the Eastern European peoples. In order to be prepared to\r\nhelp re-establish historic ties of friendship, I am asking the Congress\r\nfor increased discretion to use economic tools in this area whenever\r\nthis is found to be clearly in the national interest. This will require\r\namendment of the Mutual Defense Assistance Control Act along the lines I\r\nproposed as a member of the Senate, and upon which the Senate voted last\r\nsummer. Meanwhile, I hope to explore with the Polish government the\r\npossibility of using our frozen Polish funds on projects of peace that\r\nwill demonstrate our abiding friendship for and interest in the people\r\nof Poland.\r\n\r\nThird, we must sharpen our political and diplomatic tools--the means of\r\ncooperation and agreement on which an enforceable world order must\r\nultimately rest.\r\n\r\nI have already taken steps to coordinate and expand our disarmament\r\neffort--to increase our programs of research and study--and to make arms\r\ncontrol a central goal of our national policy under my direction. The\r\ndeadly arms race, and the huge resources it absorbs, have too long\r\novershadowed all else we must do. We must prevent that arms race from\r\nspreading to new nations, to new nuclear powers and to the reaches of outer\r\nspace. We must make certain that our negotiators are better informed and\r\nbetter prepared--to formulate workable proposals of our own and to make\r\nsound judgments about the proposals of others.\r\n\r\nI have asked the other governments concerned to agree to a reasonable delay\r\nin the talks on a nuclear test ban--and it is our intention to resume\r\nnegotiations prepared to reach a final agreement with any nation that is\r\nequally willing to agree to an effective and enforceable treaty.\r\n\r\nWe must increase our support of the United Nations as an instrument to end\r\nthe Cold War instead of an arena in which to fight it. In recognition of\r\nits increasing importance and the doubling of its membership\r\n\r\n--we are enlarging and strengthening our own mission to the U.N.\r\n\r\n--we shall help insure that it is properly financed.\r\n\r\n--we shall work to see that the integrity of the office of the\r\nSecretary-General is maintained.\r\n\r\n--And I would address a special plea to the smaller nations of the\r\nworld--to join with us in strengthening this organization, which is far\r\nmore essential to their security than it is to ours--the only body in the\r\nworld where no nation need be powerful to be secure, where every nation has\r\nan equal voice, and where any nation can exert influence not according to\r\nthe strength of its armies but according to the strength of its ideas. It\r\ndeserves the support of all.\r\n\r\nFinally, this Administration intends to explore promptly all possible areas\r\nof cooperation with the Soviet Union and other nations \"to invoke the\r\nwonders of science instead of its terrors.\" Specifically, I now invite all\r\nnations--including the Soviet Union--to join with us in developing a\r\nweather prediction program, in a new communications satellite program and\r\nin preparation for probing the distant planets of Mars and Venus, probes\r\nwhich may someday unlock the deepest secrets of the universe.\r\n\r\nToday this country is ahead in the science and technology of space, while\r\nthe Soviet Union is ahead in the capacity to lift large vehicles into\r\norbit. Both nations would help themselves as well as other nations by\r\nremoving these endeavors from the bitter and wasteful competition of the\r\nCold War. The United States would be willing to join with the Soviet Union\r\nand the scientists of all nations in a greater effort to make the fruits\r\nof this new knowledge available to all--and, beyond that, in an effort to\r\nextend farm technology to hungry nations--to wipe out disease--to increase\r\nthe exchanges of scientists and their knowledge--and to make our own\r\nlaboratories available to technicians of other lands who lack the\r\nfacilities to pursue their own work. Where nature makes natural allies of\r\nus all, we can demonstrate that beneficial relations are possible even\r\nwith those with whom we most deeply disagree--and this must someday be the\r\nbasis of world peace and world law.\r\n\r\n                                   V.\r\n\r\nI have commented on the state of the domestic economy, our balance of\r\npayments, our Federal and social budget and the state of the world. I would\r\nlike to conclude with a few remarks about the state of the Executive\r\nbranch. We have found it full of honest and useful public servants--but\r\ntheir capacity to act decisively at the exact time action is needed has too\r\noften been muffled in the morass of committees, timidities and fictitious\r\ntheories which have created a growing gap between decision and execution,\r\nbetween planning and reality. In a time of rapidly deteriorating situations\r\nat home and abroad, this is bad for the public service and particularly bad\r\nfor the country; and we mean to make a change.\r\n\r\nI have pledged myself and my colleagues in the cabinet to a continuous\r\nencouragement of initiative, responsibility and energy in serving the\r\npublic interest. Let every public servant know, whether his post is high or\r\nlow, that a man's rank and reputation in this Administration will be\r\ndetermined by the size of the job he does, and not by the size of his\r\nstaff, his office or his budget. Let it be clear that this Administration\r\nrecognizes the value of dissent and daring--that we greet healthy\r\ncontroversy as the hallmark of healthy change. Let the public service be a\r\nproud and lively career. And let every man and woman who works in any area\r\nof our national government, in any branch, at any level, be able to say\r\nwith pride and with honor in future years: \"I served the United States\r\ngovernment in that hour of our nation's need.\"\r\n\r\nFor only with complete dedication by us all to the national interest can we\r\nbring our country through the troubled years that lie ahead. Our problems\r\nare critical. The tide is unfavorable. The news will be worse before it is\r\nbetter. And while hoping and working for the best, we should prepare\r\nourselves now for the worst.\r\n\r\nWe cannot escape our dangers--neither must we let them drive us into panic\r\nor narrow isolation. In many areas of the world where the balance of power\r\nalready rests with our adversaries, the forces of freedom are sharply\r\ndivided. It is one of the ironies of our time that the techniques of a\r\nharsh and repressive system should be able to instill discipline and ardor\r\nin its servants--while the blessings of liberty have too often stood for\r\nprivilege, materialism and a life of ease.\r\n\r\nBut I have a different view of liberty.\r\n\r\nLife in 1961 will not be easy. Wishing it, predicting it, even asking for\r\nit, will not make it so. There will be further setbacks before the tide is\r\nturned. But turn it we must. The hopes of all mankind rest upon us--not\r\nsimply upon those of us in this chamber, but upon the peasant in Laos, the\r\nfisherman in Nigeria, the exile from Cuba, the spirit that moves every man\r\nand Nation who shares our hopes for freedom and the future. And in the\r\nfinal analysis, they rest most of all upon the pride and perseverance of\r\nour fellow citizens of the great Republic.\r\n\r\nIn the words of a great President, whose birthday we honor today, closing\r\nhis final State of the Union Message sixteen years ago, \"We pray that we\r\nmay be worthy of the unlimited opportunities that God has given us.\"\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nJohn F. Kennedy\r\nJanuary 11, 1962\r\n\r\nMr. Vice President, my old colleague from Massachusetts and your new\r\nSpeaker, John McCormack, Members of the 87th Congress, ladies and\r\ngentlemen:\r\n\r\nThis week we begin anew our joint and separate efforts to build the\r\nAmerican future. But, sadly, we build without a man who linked a long past\r\nwith the present and looked strongly to the future. \"Mister Sam\" Rayburn is\r\ngone. Neither this House nor the Nation is the same without him.\r\n\r\nMembers of the Congress, the Constitution makes us not rivals for power but\r\npartners for progress. We are all trustees for the American people,\r\ncustodians of the American heritage. It is my task to report the State of\r\nthe Union--to improve it is the task of us all.\r\n\r\nIn the past year, I have traveled not only across our own land but to\r\nother lands--to the North and the South, and across the seas. And I have\r\nfound--as I am sure you have, in your travels--that people everywhere,\r\nin spite of occasional disappointments, look to us--not to our wealth or\r\npower, but to the splendor of our ideals. For our Nation is commissioned\r\nby history to be either an observer of freedom's failure or the cause of\r\nits success. Our overriding obligation in the months ahead is to fulfill\r\nthe world's hopes by fulfilling our own faith.\r\n\r\nI. STRENGTHENING THE ECONOMY\r\n\r\nThat task must begin at home. For if we cannot fulfill our own ideals here,\r\nwe cannot expect others to accept them. And when the youngest child alive\r\ntoday has grown to the cares of manhood, our position in the world will\r\nbe determined first of all by what provisions we make today--for his\r\neducation, his health, and his opportunities for a good home and a good\r\njob and a good life.\r\n\r\nAt home, we began the year in the valley of recession--we completed it on\r\nthe high road of recovery and growth. With the help of new Congressionally\r\napproved or Administratively increased stimulants to our economy, the\r\nnumber of major surplus labor areas has declined from 101 to 60;\r\nnon-agricultural employment has increased by more than a million jobs; and\r\nthe average factory work-week has risen to well over 40 hours. At year's\r\nend the economy which Mr. Khrushchev once called a \"stumbling horse\" was\r\nracing to new records in consumer spending, labor income, and industrial\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nWe are gratified--but we are not satisfied. Too many unemployed are still\r\nlooking for the blessings of prosperity. As those who leave our schools and\r\nfarms demand new jobs, automation takes old jobs away. To expand our growth\r\nand job opportunities, I urge on the Congress three measures:\r\n\r\n(1) First, the Manpower Training and Development Act, to stop the waste of\r\nable-bodied men and women who want to work, but whose only skill has been\r\nreplaced by a machine, or moved with a mill, or shut down with a mine;\r\n\r\n(2) Second, the Youth Employment Opportunities Act, to help train and place\r\nnot only the one million young Americans who are both out of school and out\r\nof work, but the twenty-six million young Americans entering the labor\r\nmarket in this decade; and\r\n\r\n(3) Third, the 8 percent tax credit for investment in machinery and\r\nequipment, which, combined with planned revisions of depreciation\r\nallowances, will spur our modernization, our growth, and our ability to\r\ncompete abroad.\r\n\r\nMoreover--pleasant as it may be to bask in the warmth of recovery--let us\r\nnot forget that we have suffered three recessions in the last 7 years. The\r\ntime to repair the roof is when the sun is shining--by filling three basic\r\ngaps in our anti-recession protection. We need:\r\n\r\n(1) First, Presidential stand-by authority, subject to Congressional veto,\r\nto adjust personal income tax rates downward within a specified range and\r\ntime, to slow down an economic decline before it has dragged us all down;\r\n\r\n(2) Second, Presidential stand-by authority, upon a given rise in the rate\r\nof unemployment, to accelerate Federal and federally-aided capital\r\nimprovement programs; and\r\n\r\n(3) Third, a permanent strengthening of our unemployment compensation\r\nsystem--to maintain for our fellow citizens searching for a job who cannot\r\nfind it, their purchasing power and their living standards without constant\r\nresort--as we have seen in recent years by the Congress and the\r\nAdministrations--to temporary supplements.\r\n\r\nIf we enact this six-part program, we can show the whole world that a free\r\neconomy need not be an unstable economy--that a free system need not leave\r\nmen unemployed--and that a free society is not only the most productive but\r\nthe most stable form of organization yet fashioned by man.\r\n\r\nII. FIGHTING INFLATION\r\n\r\nBut recession is only one enemy of a free economy--inflation is another.\r\nLast year, 1961, despite rising production and demand, consumer prices held\r\nalmost steady--and wholesale prices declined. This is the best record of\r\noverall price stability of any comparable period of recovery since the end\r\nof World War II.\r\n\r\nInflation too often follows in the shadow of growth--while price stability\r\nis made easy by stagnation or controls. But we mean to maintain both\r\nstability and growth in a climate of freedom.\r\n\r\nOur first line of defense against inflation is the good sense and public\r\nspirit of business and labor--keeping their total increases in wages and\r\nprofits in step with productivity. There is no single statistical test to\r\nguide each company and each union. But I strongly urge them--for their\r\ncountry's interest, and for their own--to apply the test of the public\r\ninterest to these transactions.\r\n\r\nWithin this same framework of growth and wage-price stability:\r\n\r\n--This administration has helped keep our economy competitive by widening\r\nthe access of small business to credit and Government contracts, and by\r\nstepping up the drive against monopoly, price-fixing, and racketeering;\r\n\r\n--We will submit a Federal Pay Reform bill aimed at giving our classified,\r\npostal, and other employees new pay scales more comparable to those of\r\nprivate industry;\r\n\r\n--We are holding the fiscal 1962 budget deficit far below the level\r\nincurred after the last recession in 1958; and, finally,\r\n\r\n--I am submitting for fiscal 1963 a balanced Federal Budget.\r\n\r\nThis is a joint responsibility, requiring Congressional cooperation on\r\nappropriations, and on three sources of income in particular:\r\n\r\n(1) First, an increase in postal rates, to end the postal deficit;\r\n\r\n(2) Second, passage of the tax reforms previously urged, to remove\r\nunwarranted tax preferences, and to apply to dividends and to interest the\r\nsame withholding requirements we have long applied to wages; and\r\n\r\n(3) Third, extension of the present excise and corporation tax rates,\r\nexcept for those changes--which will be recommended in a message--affecting\r\ntransportation.\r\n\r\nIII. GETTING AMERICA MOVING\r\n\r\nBut a stronger nation and economy require more than a balanced Budget. They\r\nrequire progress in those programs that spur our growth and fortify our\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nCITIES\r\n\r\nA strong America depends on its cities--America's glory, and sometimes\r\nAmerica's shame. To substitute sunlight for congestion and progress for\r\ndecay, we have stepped up existing urban renewal and housing programs, and\r\nlaunched new ones--redoubled the attack on water pollution--speeded aid to\r\nairports, hospitals, highways, and our declining mass transit systems--and\r\nsecured new weapons to combat organized crime, racketeering, and youth\r\ndelinquency, assisted by the coordinated and hard-hitting efforts of our\r\ninvestigative services: the FBI, the Internal Revenue, the Bureau of\r\nNarcotics, and many others. We shall need further anti-crime, mass transit,\r\nand transportation legislation--and new tools to fight air pollution. And\r\nwith all this effort under way, both equity and common sense require that\r\nour nation's urban areas--containing three-fourths of our population--sit\r\nas equals at the Cabinet table. I urge a new Department of Urban Affairs\r\nand Housing.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE AND RESOURCES\r\n\r\nA strong America also depends on its farms and natural resources. American\r\nfarmers took heart in 1961--from a billion dollar rise in farm income--and\r\nfrom a hopeful start on reducing the farm surpluses. But we are still\r\noperating under a patchwork accumulation of old laws, which cost us $1\r\nbillion a year in CCC carrying charges alone, yet fail to halt rural\r\npoverty or boost farm earnings.\r\n\r\nOur task is to master and turn to fully fruitful ends the magnificent\r\nproductivity of our farms and farmers. The revolution on our own\r\ncountryside stands in the sharpest contrast to the repeated farm failures\r\nof the Communist nations and is a source of pride to us all. Since 1950 our\r\nagricultural output per man-hour has actually doubled! Without new,\r\nrealistic measures, it will someday swamp our farmers and our taxpayers in\r\na national scandal or a farm depression.\r\n\r\nI will, therefore, submit to the Congress a new comprehensive farm\r\nprogram--tailored to fit the use of our land and the supplies of each crop\r\nto the long-range needs of the sixties--and designed to prevent chaos in\r\nthe sixties with a program of common sense.\r\n\r\nWe also need for the sixties--if we are to bequeath our full national\r\nestate to our heirs--a new long-range conservation and recreation\r\nprogram--expansion of our superb national parks and forests--preservation\r\nof our authentic wilderness areas--new starts on water and power projects\r\nas our population steadily increases--and expanded REA generation and\r\ntransmission loans.\r\n\r\nCIVIL RIGHTS\r\n\r\nBut America stands for progress in human rights as well as economic\r\naffairs, and a strong America requires the assurance of full and equal\r\nrights to all its citizens, of any race or of any color. This\r\nAdministration has shown as never before how much could be done through the\r\nfull use of Executive powers--through the enforcement of laws already\r\npassed by the Congress--through persuasion, negotiation, and litigation, to\r\nsecure the constitutional rights of all: the right to vote, the right to\r\ntravel without hindrance across State lines, and the right to free public\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nI issued last March a comprehensive order to guarantee the right to equal\r\nemployment opportunity in all Federal agencies and contractors. The Vice\r\nPresident's Committee thus created has done much, including the voluntary\r\n\"Plans for Progress\" which, in all sections of the country, are achieving a\r\nquiet but striking success in opening up to all races new professional,\r\nsupervisory, and other job opportunities.\r\n\r\nBut there is much more to be done--by the Executive, by the courts, and by\r\nthe Congress. Among the bills now pending before you, on which the\r\nexecutive departments will comment in detail, are appropriate methods of\r\nstrengthening these basic rights which have our full support. The right to\r\nvote, for example, should no longer be denied through such arbitrary\r\ndevices on a local level, sometimes abused, such as literacy tests and poll\r\ntaxes. As we approach the 100th anniversary, next January, of the\r\nEmancipation Proclamation, let the acts of every branch of the\r\nGovernment--and every citizen--portray that \"righteousness does exalt a\r\nnation.\"\r\n\r\nHEALTH AND WELFARE\r\n\r\nFinally, a strong America cannot neglect the aspirations of its\r\ncitizens--the welfare of the needy, the health care of the elderly, the\r\neducation of the young. For we are not developing the Nation's wealth for\r\nits own sake. Wealth is the means--and people are the ends. All our\r\nmaterial riches will avail us little if we do not use them to expand the\r\nopportunities of our people.\r\n\r\nLast year, we improved the diet of needy people--provided more hot lunches\r\nand fresh milk to school children--built more college dormitories--and, for\r\nthe elderly, expanded private housing, nursing homes, health services, and\r\nsocial security. But we have just begun.\r\n\r\nTo help those least fortunate of all, I am recommending a new public\r\nwelfare program, stressing services instead of support, rehabilitation\r\ninstead of relief, and training for useful work instead of prolonged\r\ndependency.\r\n\r\nTo relieve the critical shortage of doctors and dentists--and this is a\r\nmatter which should concern us all--and expand research, I urge action to\r\naid medical and dental colleges and scholarships and to establish new\r\nNational Institutes of Health.\r\n\r\nTo take advantage of modern vaccination achievements, I am proposing a mass\r\nimmunization program, aimed at the virtual elimination of such ancient\r\nenemies of our children as polio, diphtheria, whooping cough, and tetanus.\r\n\r\nTo protect our consumers from the careless and the unscrupulous, I shall\r\nrecommend improvements in the Food and Drug laws--strengthening inspection\r\nand standards, halting unsafe and worthless products, preventing misleading\r\nlabels, and cracking down on the illicit sale of habit-forming drugs.\r\n\r\nBut in matters of health, no piece of unfinished business is more important\r\nor more urgent than the enactment under the social security system of\r\nhealth insurance for the aged.\r\n\r\nFor our older citizens have longer and more frequent illnesses, higher\r\nhospital and medical bills and too little income to pay them. Private\r\nhealth insurance helps very few--for its cost is high and its coverage\r\nlimited. Public welfare cannot help those too proud to seek relief but\r\nhard-pressed to pay their own bills. Nor can their children or\r\ngrandchildren always sacrifice their own health budgets to meet this\r\nconstant drain.\r\n\r\nSocial security has long helped to meet the hardships of retirement, death,\r\nand disability. I now urge that its coverage be extended without further\r\ndelay to provide health insurance for the elderly.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION\r\n\r\nEqually important to our strength is the quality of our education. Eight\r\nmillion adult Americans are classified as functionally illiterate. This is\r\na disturbing figure--reflected in Selective Service rejection\r\nrates--reflected in welfare rolls and crime rates. And I shall recommend\r\nplans for a massive attack to end this adult illiteracy.\r\n\r\nI shall also recommend bills to improve educational quality, to stimulate\r\nthe arts, and, at the college level, to provide Federal loans for the\r\nconstruction of academic facilities and Federally financed scholarships.\r\n\r\nIf this Nation is to grow in wisdom and strength, then every able high\r\nschool graduate should have the opportunity to develop his talents. Yet\r\nnearly half lack either the funds or the facilities to attend college.\r\nEnrollments are going to double in our colleges in the short space of 10\r\nyears. The annual cost per student is skyrocketing to astronomical\r\nlevels--now averaging $1,650 a year, although almost half of our families\r\nearn less than $5,000. They cannot afford such costs--but this Nation\r\ncannot afford to maintain its military power and neglect its brainpower.\r\n\r\nBut excellence in education must begin at the elementary level. I sent to\r\nthe Congress last year a proposal for Federal aid to public school\r\nconstruction and teachers' salaries. I believe that bill, which passed the\r\nSenate and received House Committee approval, offered the minimum amount\r\nrequired by our needs and--in terms of across-the-board aid--the maximum\r\nscope permitted by our Constitution. I therefore see no reason to weaken or\r\nwithdraw that bill: and I urge its passage at this session.\r\n\r\n\"Civilization,\" said H. G. Wells, \"is a race between education and\r\ncatastrophe.\" It is up to you in this Congress to determine the winner of\r\nthat race.\r\n\r\nThese are not unrelated measures addressed to specific gaps or grievances\r\nin our national life. They are the pattern of our intentions and the\r\nfoundation of our hopes. \"I believe in democracy,\" said Woodrow Wilson,\r\n\"because it releases the energy of every human being.\" The dynamic of\r\ndemocracy is the power and the purpose of the individual, and the policy of\r\nthis administration is to give to the individual the opportunity to realize\r\nhis own highest possibilities.\r\n\r\nOur program is to open to all the opportunity for steady and productive\r\nemployment, to remove from all the handicap of arbitrary or irrational\r\nexclusion, to offer to all the facilities for education and health and\r\nwelfare, to make society the servant of the individual and the individual\r\nthe source of progress, and thus to realize for all the full promise of\r\nAmerican life.\r\n\r\nIV. OUR GOALS ABROAD\r\n\r\nAll of these efforts at home give meaning to our efforts abroad. Since the\r\nclose of the Second World War, a global civil war has divided and tormented\r\nmankind. But it is not our military might, or our higher standard of\r\nliving, that has most distinguished us from our adversaries. It is our\r\nbelief that the state is the servant of the citizen and not his master.\r\n\r\nThis basic clash of ideas and wills is but one of the forces reshaping our\r\nglobe--swept as it is by the tides of hope and fear, by crises in the\r\nheadlines today that become mere footnotes tomorrow. Both the successes and\r\nthe setbacks of the past year remain on our agenda of unfinished business.\r\nFor every apparent blessing contains the seeds of danger--every area of\r\ntrouble gives out a ray of hope--and the one unchangeable certainty is that\r\nnothing is certain or unchangeable.\r\n\r\nYet our basic goal remains the same: a peaceful world community of free and\r\nindependent states--free to choose their own future and their own system,\r\nso long as it does not threaten the freedom of others.\r\n\r\nSome may choose forms and ways that we would not choose for ourselves--but\r\nit is not for us that they are choosing. We can welcome diversity--the\r\nCommunists cannot. For we offer a world of choice--they offer the world of\r\ncoercion. And the way of the past shows clearly that freedom, not coercion,\r\nis the wave of the future. At times our goal has been obscured by crisis or\r\nendangered by conflict--but it draws sustenance from five basic sources of\r\nstrength:\r\n\r\n--the moral and physical strength of the United States;\r\n\r\n--the united strength of the Atlantic Community;\r\n\r\n--the regional strength of our Hemispheric relations;\r\n\r\n--the creative strength of our efforts in the new and developing nations;\r\nand\r\n\r\n--the peace-keeping strength of the United Nations.\r\n\r\nV. OUR MILITARY STRENGTH\r\n\r\nOur moral and physical strength begins at home as already discussed. But it\r\nincludes our military strength as well. So long as fanaticism and fear\r\nbrood over the affairs of men, we must arm to deter others from\r\naggression.\r\n\r\nIn the past 12 months our military posture has steadily improved. We\r\nincreased the previous defense budget by 15 percent--not in the expectation\r\nof war but for the preservation of peace. We more than doubled our\r\nacquisition rate of Polaris submarines--we doubled the production capacity\r\nfor Minuteman missiles--and increased by 50 percent the number of manned\r\nbombers standing ready on a 15 minute alert. This year the combined force\r\nlevels planned under our new Defense budget--including nearly three hundred\r\nadditional Polaris and Minuteman missiles--have been precisely calculated\r\nto insure the continuing strength of our nuclear deterrent.\r\n\r\nBut our strength may be tested at many levels. We intend to have at all\r\ntimes the capacity to resist non-nuclear or limited attacks--as a\r\ncomplement to our nuclear capacity, not as a substitute. We have rejected\r\nany all-or-nothing posture which would leave no choice but inglorious\r\nretreat or unlimited retaliation.\r\n\r\nThus we have doubled the number of ready combat divisions in the Army's\r\nstrategic reserve--increased our troops in Europe--built up the\r\nMarines--added new sealift and airlift capacity--modernized our weapons and\r\nammunition--expanded our anti-guerrilla forces--and increased the active\r\nfleet by more than 70 vessels and our tactical air forces by nearly a dozen\r\nwings.\r\n\r\nBecause we needed to reach this higher long-term level of readiness more\r\nquickly, 155,000 members of the Reserve and National Guard were activated\r\nunder the Act of this Congress. Some disruptions and distress were\r\ninevitable. But the overwhelming majority bear their burdens--and their\r\nNation's burdens--with admirable and traditional devotion.\r\n\r\nIn the coming year, our reserve programs will be revised--two Army\r\nDivisions will, I hope, replace those Guard Divisions on duty--and\r\nsubstantial other increases will boost our Air Force fighter units, the\r\nprocurement of equipment, and our continental defense and warning efforts.\r\nThe Nation's first serious civil defense shelter program is under way,\r\nidentifying, marking, and stocking 50 million spaces; and I urge your\r\napproval of Federal incentives for the construction of public fall-out\r\nshelters in schools and hospitals and similar centers.\r\n\r\nVI. THE UNITED NATIONS\r\n\r\nBut arms alone are not enough to keep the peace--it must be kept by men.\r\nOur instrument and our hope is the United Nations--and I see little merit\r\nin the impatience of those who would abandon this imperfect world\r\ninstrument because they dislike our imperfect world. For the troubles of\r\na world organization merely reflect the troubles of the world itself. And\r\nif the organization is weakened, these troubles can only increase. We may\r\nnot always agree with every detailed action taken by every officer of the\r\nUnited Nations, or with every voting majority. But as an institution, it\r\nshould have in the future, as it has had in the past since its inception,\r\nno stronger or more faithful member than the United States of America.\r\n\r\nIn 1961 the peace-keeping strength of the United Nations was reinforced.\r\nAnd those who preferred or predicted its demise, envisioning a troika in\r\nthe seat of Hammarskjold--or Red China inside the Assembly--have seen\r\ninstead a new vigor, under a new Secretary General and a fully independent\r\nSecretariat. In making plans for a new forum and principles on disarmament\r\n--for peace-keeping in outer space--for a decade of development effort--the\r\nUN fulfilled its Charter's lofty aim.\r\n\r\nEighteen months ago the tangled and turbulent Congo presented the UN with\r\nits gravest challenge. The prospect was one of chaos--or certain big-power\r\nconfrontation, with all of its hazards and all of its risks, to us and to\r\nothers. Today the hopes have improved for peaceful conciliation within a\r\nunited Congo. This is the objective of our policy in this important area.\r\n\r\nNo policeman is universally popular--particularly when he uses his stick to\r\nrestore law and order on his beat. Those members who are willing to\r\ncontribute their votes and their views--but very little else--have created\r\na serious deficit by refusing to pay their share of special UN assessments.\r\nYet they do pay their annual assessments to retain their votes--and a new\r\nUN Bond issue, financing special operations for the next 18 months, is to\r\nbe repaid with interest from these regular assessments. This is clearly in\r\nour interest. It will not only keep the UN solvent, but require all voting\r\nmembers to pay their fair share of its activities. Our share of special\r\noperations has long been much higher than our share of the annual\r\nassessment--and the bond issue will in effect reduce our disproportionate\r\nobligation, and for these reasons, I am urging Congress to approve our\r\nparticipation.\r\n\r\nWith the approval of this Congress, we have undertaken in the past year a\r\ngreat new effort in outer space. Our aim is not simply to be first on the\r\nmoon, any more than Charles Lindbergh's real aim was to be the first to\r\nParis. His aim was to develop the techniques of our own country and other\r\ncountries in the field of air and the atmosphere, and our objective in\r\nmaking this effort, which we hope will place one of our citizens on the\r\nmoon, is to develop in a new frontier of science, commerce and cooperation,\r\nthe position of the United States and the Free World.\r\n\r\nThis Nation belongs among the first to explore it, and among the first--if\r\nnot the first--we shall be. We are offering our know-how and our\r\ncooperation to the United Nations. Our satellites will soon be providing\r\nother nations with improved weather observations. And I shall soon send to\r\nthe Congress a measure to govern the financing and operation of an\r\nInternational Communications Satellite system, in a manner consistent with\r\nthe public interest and our foreign policy.\r\n\r\nBut peace in space will help us naught once peace on earth is gone. World\r\norder will be secured only when the whole world has laid down these weapons\r\nwhich seem to offer us present security but threaten the future survival of\r\nthe human race. That armistice day seems very far away. The vast resources\r\nof this planet are being devoted more and more to the means of destroying,\r\ninstead of enriching, human life.\r\n\r\nBut the world was not meant to be a prison in which man awaits his\r\nexecution. Nor has mankind survived the tests and trials of thousands of\r\nyears to surrender everything--including its existence--now. This Nation\r\nhas the will and the faith to make a supreme effort to break the log jam\r\non disarmament and nuclear tests--and we will persist until we prevail,\r\nuntil the rule of law has replaced the ever dangerous use of force.\r\n\r\nVII. LATIN AMERICA\r\n\r\nI turn now to a prospect of great promise: our Hemispheric relations. The\r\nAlliance for Progress is being rapidly transformed from proposal to\r\nprogram. Last month in Latin America I saw for myself the quickening of\r\nhope, the revival of confidence, the new trust in our country--among\r\nworkers and farmers as well as diplomats. We have pledged our help in\r\nspeeding their economic, educational, and social progress. The Latin\r\nAmerican Republics have in turn pledged a new and strenuous effort of\r\nself-help and self-reform.\r\n\r\nTo support this historic undertaking, I am proposing--under the authority\r\ncontained in the bills of the last session of the Congress--a special\r\nlong-term Alliance for Progress fund of $3 billion. Combined with our Food\r\nfor Peace, Export-Import Bank, and other resources, this will provide more\r\nthan $1 billion a year in new support for the Alliance. In addition, we\r\nhave increased twelve-fold our Spanish and Portuguese language broadcasting\r\nin Latin America, and improved Hemispheric trade and defense. And while\r\nthe blight of communism has been increasingly exposed and isolated in the\r\nAmericas, liberty has scored a gain. The people of the Dominican Republic,\r\nwith our firm encouragement and help, and those of our sister Republics of\r\nthis Hemisphere, are safely passing through the treacherous course from\r\ndictatorship through disorder towards democracy.\r\n\r\nVIII. THE NEW AND DEVELOPING NATIONS\r\n\r\nOur efforts to help other new or developing nations, and to strengthen\r\ntheir stand for freedom, have also made progress. A newly unified Agency\r\nfor International Development is reorienting our foreign assistance to\r\nemphasize long-term development loans instead of grants, more economic aid\r\ninstead of military, individual plans to meet the individual needs of the\r\nnations, and new standards on what they must do to marshal their own\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nA newly conceived Peace Corps is winning friends and helping people in\r\nfourteen countries--supplying trained and dedicated young men and women, to\r\ngive these new nations a hand in building a society, and a glimpse of the\r\nbest that is in our country. If there is a problem here, it is that we\r\ncannot supply the spontaneous and mounting demand.\r\n\r\nA newly-expanded Food for Peace Program is feeding the hungry of many\r\nlands with the abundance of our productive farms--providing lunches for\r\nchildren in school, wages for economic development, relief for the victims\r\nof flood and famine, and a better diet for millions whose daily bread is\r\ntheir chief concern.\r\n\r\nThese programs help people; and, by helping people, they help freedom. The\r\nviews of their governments may sometimes be very different from ours--but\r\nevents in Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe teach us never to\r\nwrite off any nation as lost to the Communists. That is the lesson of our\r\ntime. We support the independence of those newer or weaker states whose\r\nhistory, geography, economy or lack of power impels them to remain outside\r\n\"entangling alliances\"--as we did for more than a century. For the\r\nindependence of nations is a bar to the Communists' \"grand design\"--it is\r\nthe basis of our own.\r\n\r\nIn the past year, for example, we have urged a neutral and independent\r\nLaos--regained there a common policy with our major allies--and insisted\r\nthat a cease-fire precede negotiations. While a workable formula for\r\nsupervising its independence is still to be achieved, both the spread\r\nof war--which might have involved this country also--and a Communist\r\noccupation have thus far been prevented.\r\n\r\nA satisfactory settlement in Laos would also help to achieve and safeguard\r\nthe peace in Viet-Nam--where the foe is increasing his tactics of\r\nterror--where our own efforts have been stepped up--and where the local\r\ngovernment has initiated new programs and reforms to broaden the base of\r\nresistance. The systematic aggression now bleeding that country is not a\r\n\"war of liberation\"--for Viet-Nam is already free. It is a war of attempted\r\nsubjugation--and it will be resisted.\r\n\r\nIX. THE ATLANTIC COMMUNITY\r\n\r\nFinally, the united strength of the Atlantic Community has flourished in\r\nthe last year under severe tests. NATO has increased both the number and\r\nthe readiness of its air, ground, and naval units--both its nuclear and\r\nnon-nuclear capabilities. Even greater efforts by all its members are still\r\nrequired. Nevertheless our unity of purpose and will has been, I believe,\r\nimmeasurably strengthened.\r\n\r\nThe threat to the brave city of Berlin remains. In these last 6 months the\r\nAllies have made it unmistakably clear that our presence in Berlin, our\r\nfree access thereto, and the freedom of two million West Berliners would\r\nnot be surrendered either to force or through appeasement--and to maintain\r\nthose rights and obligations, we are prepared to talk, when appropriate,\r\nand to fight, if necessary. Every member of NATO stands with us in a common\r\ncommitment to preserve this symbol of free man's will to remain free.\r\n\r\nI cannot now predict the course of future negotiations over Berlin. I can\r\nonly say that we are sparing no honorable effort to find a peaceful and\r\nmutually acceptable resolution of this problem. I believe such a resolution\r\ncan be found, and with it an improvement in our relations with the Soviet\r\nUnion, if only the leaders in the Kremlin will recognize the basic rights\r\nand interests involved, and the interest of all mankind in peace.\r\n\r\nBut the Atlantic Community is no longer concerned with purely military\r\naims. As its common undertakings grow at an ever-increasing pace, we are,\r\nand increasingly will be, partners in aid, trade, defense, diplomacy, and\r\nmonetary affairs.\r\n\r\nThe emergence of the new Europe is being matched by the emergence of new\r\nties across the Atlantic. It is a matter of undramatic daily cooperation in\r\nhundreds of workaday tasks: of currencies kept in effective relation, of\r\ndevelopment loans meshed together, of standardized weapons, and concerted\r\ndiplomatic positions. The Atlantic Community grows, not like a volcanic\r\nmountain, by one mighty explosion, but like a coral reef, from the\r\naccumulating activity of all.\r\n\r\nThus, we in the free world are moving steadily toward unity and\r\ncooperation, in the teeth of that old Bolshevik prophecy, and at the very\r\ntime when extraordinary rumbles of discord can be heard across the Iron\r\nCurtain. It is not free societies which bear within them the seeds of\r\ninevitable disunity.\r\n\r\nX. OUR BALANCE OF PAYMENTS\r\n\r\nOn one special problem, of great concern to our friends, and to us, I am\r\nproud to give the Congress an encouraging report. Our efforts to safeguard\r\nthe dollar are progressing. In the 11 months preceding last February 1, we\r\nsuffered a net loss of nearly $2 billion in gold. In the 11 months that\r\nfollowed, the loss was just over half a billion dollars. And our deficit in\r\nour basic transactions with the rest of the world--trade, defense, foreign\r\naid, and capital, excluding volatile short-term flows--has been reduced\r\nfrom $2 billion for 1960 to about one-third that amount for 1961.\r\nSpeculative fever against the dollar is ending--and confidence in the\r\ndollar has been restored.\r\n\r\nWe did not--and could not--achieve these gains through import restrictions,\r\ntroop withdrawals, exchange controls, dollar devaluation or choking off\r\ndomestic recovery. We acted not in panic but in perspective. But the\r\nproblem is not yet solved. Persistently large deficits would endanger our\r\neconomic growth and our military and defense commitments abroad. Our goal\r\nmust be a reasonable equilibrium in our balance of payments. With the\r\ncooperation of the Congress, business, labor, and our major allies, that\r\ngoal can be reached.\r\n\r\nWe shall continue to attract foreign tourists and investments to our\r\nshores, to seek increased military purchases here by our allies, to\r\nmaximize foreign aid procurement from American firms, to urge increased aid\r\nfrom other fortunate nations to the less fortunate, to seek tax laws which\r\ndo not favor investment in other industrialized nations or tax havens, and\r\nto urge coordination of allied fiscal and monetary policies so as to\r\ndiscourage large and disturbing capital movements.\r\n\r\nTRADE\r\n\r\nAbove all, if we are to pay for our commitments abroad, we must expand our\r\nexports. Our businessmen must be export conscious and export competitive.\r\nOur tax policies must spur modernization of our plants--our wage and price\r\ngains must be consistent with productivity to hold the line on prices--our\r\nexport credit and promotion campaigns for American industries must continue\r\nto expand.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest challenge of all is posed by the growth of the European\r\nCommon Market. Assuming the accession of the United Kingdom, there will\r\narise across the Atlantic a trading partner behind a single external tariff\r\nsimilar to ours with an economy which nearly equals our own. Will we in\r\nthis country adapt our thinking to these new prospects and patterns--or\r\nwill we wait until events have passed us by?\r\n\r\nThis is the year to decide. The Reciprocal Trade Act is expiring. We need a\r\nnew law--a wholly new approach--a bold new instrument of American trade\r\npolicy. Our decision could well affect the unity of the West, the course of\r\nthe Cold War, and the economic growth of our Nation for a generation to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nIf we move decisively, our factories and farms can increase their sales to\r\ntheir richest, fastest-growing market. Our exports will increase. Our\r\nbalance of payments position will improve. And we will have forged across\r\nthe Atlantic a trading partnership with vast resources for freedom.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, we hang back in deference to local economic\r\npressures, we will find ourselves cut off from our major allies.\r\nIndustries--and I believe this is most vital--industries will move their\r\nplants and jobs and capital inside the walls of the Common Market, and\r\njobs, therefore, will be lost here in the United States if they cannot\r\notherwise compete for its consumers. Our farm surpluses--our balance of\r\ntrade, as you all know, to Europe, the Common Market, in farm products, is\r\nnearly three or four to one in our favor, amounting to one of the best\r\nearners of dollars in our balance of payments structure, and without\r\nentrance to this Market, without the ability to enter it, our farm\r\nsurpluses will pile up in the Middle West, tobacco in the South, and other\r\ncommodities, which have gone through Western Europe for 15 years. Our\r\nbalance of payments position will worsen. Our consumers will lack a wider\r\nchoice of goods at lower prices. And millions of American workers--whose\r\njobs depend on the sale or the transportation or the distribution of\r\nexports or imports, or whose jobs will be endangered by the movement of our\r\ncapital to Europe, or whose jobs can be maintained only in an expanding\r\neconomy--these millions of workers in your home States and mine will see\r\ntheir real interests sacrificed.\r\n\r\nMembers of the Congress: The United States did not rise to greatness by\r\nwaiting for others to lead. This Nation is the world's foremost\r\nmanufacturer, farmer, banker, consumer, and exporter. The Common Market is\r\nmoving ahead at an economic growth rate twice ours. The Communist economic\r\noffensive is under way. The opportunity is ours--the initiative is up to\r\nus--and I believe that 1962 is the time.\r\n\r\nTo seize that initiative, I shall shortly send to the Congress a new\r\nfive-year Trade Expansion Action, far-reaching in scope but designed with\r\ngreat care to make certain that its benefits to our people far outweigh any\r\nrisks. The bill will permit the gradual elimination of tariffs here in the\r\nUnited States and in the Common Market on those items in which we together\r\nsupply 80 percent of the world's trade--mostly items in which our own\r\nability to compete is demonstrated by the fact that we sell abroad, in\r\nthese items, substantially more than we import. This step will make it\r\npossible for our major industries to compete with their counterparts in\r\nWestern Europe for access to European consumers.\r\n\r\nOn other goods the bill will permit a gradual reduction of duties up to 50\r\npercent--permitting bargaining by major categories--and provide for\r\nappropriate and tested forms of assistance to firms and employees adjusting\r\nto import competition. We are not neglecting the safeguards provided by\r\nperil points, an escape clause, or the National Security Amendment. Nor are\r\nwe abandoning our non-European friends or our traditional \"most-favored\r\nnation\" principle. On the contrary, the bill will provide new encouragement\r\nfor their sale of tropical agricultural products, so important to our\r\nfriends in Latin America, who have long depended upon the European market,\r\nwho now find themselves faced with new challenges which we must join with\r\nthem in overcoming.\r\n\r\nConcessions, in this bargaining, must of course be reciprocal, not\r\nunilateral. The Common Market will not fulfill its own high promise unless\r\nits outside tariff walls are low. The dangers of restriction or timidity in\r\nour own policy have counterparts for our friends in Europe. For together we\r\nface a common challenge: to enlarge the prosperity of free men\r\neverywhere--to build in partnership a new trading community in which all\r\nfree nations may gain from the productive energy of free competitive\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nThese various elements in our foreign policy lead, as I have said, to a\r\nsingle goal--the goal of a peaceful world of free and independent states.\r\nThis is our guide for the present and our vision for the future--a free\r\ncommunity of nations, independent but interdependent, uniting north and\r\nsouth, east and west, in one great family of man, outgrowing and\r\ntranscending the hates and fears that rend our age.\r\n\r\nWe will not reach that goal today, or tomorrow. We may not reach it in our\r\nown lifetime. But the quest is the greatest adventure of our century. We\r\nsometimes chafe at the burden of our obligations, the complexity of our\r\ndecisions, the agony of our choices. But there is no comfort or security\r\nfor us in evasion, no solution in abdication, no relief in\r\nirresponsibility.\r\n\r\nA year ago, in assuming the tasks of the Presidency, I said that few\r\ngenerations, in all history, had been granted the role of being the great\r\ndefender of freedom in its hour of maximum danger. This is our good\r\nfortune; and I welcome it now as I did a year ago. For it is the fate of\r\nthis generation--of you in the Congress and of me as President--to live\r\nwith a struggle we did not start, in a world we did not make. But the\r\npressures of life are not always distributed by choice. And while no\r\nnation has ever faced such a challenge, no nation has ever been so ready\r\nto seize the burden and the glory of freedom.\r\n\r\nAnd in this high endeavor, may God watch over the United States of America.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nJohn F. Kennedy\r\nJanuary 14, 1963\r\n\r\nMr. Vice President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the 88th Congress:\r\n\r\nI congratulate you all--not merely on your electoral victory but on your\r\nselected role in history. For you and I are privileged to serve the great\r\nRepublic in what could be the most decisive decade in its long history. The\r\nchoices we make, for good or ill, may well shape the state of the Union for\r\ngenerations yet to come.\r\n\r\nLittle more than 100 weeks ago I assumed the office of President of the\r\nUnited States. In seeking the help of the Congress and our countrymen, I\r\npledged no easy answers. I pledged--and asked--only toil and dedication.\r\nThese the Congress and the people have given in good measure. And today,\r\nhaving witnessed in recent months a heightened respect for our national\r\npurpose and power--having seen the courageous calm of a united people in\r\na perilous hour--and having observed a steady improvement in the\r\nopportunities and well-being of our citizens--I can report to you that\r\nthe state of this old but youthful Union, in the 175th year of its life,\r\nis good.\r\n\r\nIn the world beyond our borders, steady progress has been made in building\r\na world of order. The people of West Berlin remain both free and secure. A\r\nsettlement, though still precarious, has been reached in Laos. The\r\nspearpoint of aggression has been blunted in Viet-Nam. The end of agony may\r\nbe in sight in the Congo. The doctrine of troika is dead. And, while danger\r\ncontinues, a deadly threat has been removed in Cuba.\r\n\r\nAt home, the recession is behind us. Well over a million more men and women\r\nare working today than were working 2 years ago. The average factory\r\nwork week is once again more than 40 hours; our industries are turning out\r\nmore goods than ever before; and more than half of the manufacturing\r\ncapacity that lay silent and wasted 100 weeks ago is humming with\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nIn short, both at home and abroad, there may now be a temptation to relax.\r\nFor the road has been long, the burden heavy, and the pace consistently\r\nurgent.\r\n\r\nBut we cannot be satisfied to rest here. This is the side of the hill, not\r\nthe top. The mere absence of war is not peace. The mere absence of\r\nrecession is not growth. We have made a beginning--but we have only begun.\r\n\r\nNow the time has come to make the most of our gains--to translate the\r\nrenewal of our national strength into the achievement of our national\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n                                   I.\r\n\r\nAmerica has enjoyed 22 months of uninterrupted economic recovery. But\r\nrecovery is not enough. If we are to prevail in the long run, we must\r\nexpand the long-run strength of our economy. We must move along the path to\r\na higher rate of growth and full employment.\r\n\r\nFor this would mean tens of billions of dollars more each year in\r\nproduction, profits, wages, and public revenues. It would mean an end to\r\nthe persistent slack which has kept our unemployment at or above 5 percent\r\nfor 61 out of the past 62 months--and an end to the growing pressures for\r\nsuch restrictive measures as the 35-hour week, which alone could increase\r\nhourly labor costs by as much as 14 percent, start a new wage-price spiral\r\nof inflation, and undercut our efforts to compete with other nations.\r\n\r\nTo achieve these greater gains, one step, above all, is essential--the\r\nenactment this year of a substantial reduction and revision in Federal\r\nincome taxes.\r\n\r\nFor it is increasingly clear--to those in Government, business, and labor\r\nwho are responsible for our economy's success--that our obsolete tax system\r\nexerts too heavy a drag on private purchasing power, profits, and\r\nemployment. Designed to check inflation in earlier years, it now checks\r\ngrowth instead. It discourages extra effort and risk. It distorts the use\r\nof resources. It invites recurrent recessions, depresses our Federal\r\nrevenues, and causes chronic budget deficits.\r\n\r\nNow, when the inflationary pressures of the war and the post-war years no\r\nlonger threaten, and the dollar commands new respect--now, when no military\r\ncrisis strains our resources--now is the time to act. We cannot afford to\r\nbe timid or slow. For this is the most urgent task confronting the Congress\r\nin 1963.\r\n\r\nIn an early message, I shall propose a permanent reduction in tax rates\r\nwhich will lower liabilities by $13.5 billion. Of this, $11 billion results\r\nfrom reducing individual tax rates, which now range between 20 and 91\r\npercent, to a more sensible range of 14 to 65 percent, with a split in the\r\npresent first bracket. Two and one-half billion dollars results from\r\nreducing corporate tax rates, from 52 percent--which gives the Government\r\ntoday a majority interest in profits--to the permanent pre-Korean level of\r\n47 percent. This is in addition to the more than $2 billion cut in\r\ncorporate tax liabilities resulting from last year's investment credit and\r\ndepreciation reform.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this reduction within the limits of a manageable budgetary\r\ndeficit, I urge: first, that these cuts be phased over 3 calendar years,\r\nbeginning in 1963 with a cut of some $6 billion at annual rates; second,\r\nthat these reductions be coupled with selected structural changes,\r\nbeginning in 1964, which will broaden the tax base, end unfair or\r\nunnecessary preferences, remove or lighten certain hardships, and in the\r\nnet offset some $3.5 billion of the revenue loss; and third, that budgetary\r\nreceipts at the outset be increased by $1.5 billion a year, without any\r\nchange in tax liabilities, by gradually shifting the tax payments of large\r\ncorporations to a more current time schedule. This combined program, by\r\nincreasing the amount of our national income, will in time result in still\r\nhigher Federal revenues. It is a fiscally responsible program--the surest\r\nand the soundest way of achieving in time a balanced budget in a balanced\r\nfull employment economy.\r\n\r\nThis net reduction in tax liabilities of $10 billion will increase the\r\npurchasing power of American families and business enterprises in every tax\r\nbracket, with greatest increase going to our low-income consumers. It will,\r\nin addition, encourage the initiative and risk-taking on which our free\r\nsystem depends--induce more investment, production, and capacity use--help\r\nprovide the 2 million new jobs we need every year--and reinforce the\r\nAmerican principle of additional reward for additional effort.\r\n\r\nI do not say that a measure for tax reduction and reform is the only way to\r\nachieve these goals.\r\n\r\nNo doubt a massive increase in Federal spending could also create jobs\r\nand growth, but in today's setting, private consumers, employers, and\r\ninvestors should be given a full opportunity first.\r\n\r\nNo doubt a temporary tax cut could provide a spur to our economy--but a\r\nlong-run problem compels a long-run solution.\r\n\r\nNo doubt a reduction in either individual or corporation taxes alone\r\nwould be of great help--but corporations need customers and job seekers\r\nneed jobs.\r\n\r\nNo doubt tax reduction without reform would sound simpler and more\r\nattractive to many--but our growth is also hampered by a host of tax\r\ninequities and special preferences which have distorted the flow of\r\ninvestment.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, there are no doubt some who would prefer to put off a tax\r\ncut in the hope that ultimately an end to the cold war would make possible\r\nan equivalent cut in expenditures--but that end is not in view and to wait\r\nfor it would be costly and self-defeating.\r\n\r\nIn submitting a tax program which will, of course, temporarily increase the\r\ndeficit but can ultimately end it--and in recognition of the need to\r\ncontrol expenditures--I will shortly submit a fiscal 1964 administrative\r\nbudget which, while allowing for needed rises in defense, space, and fixed\r\ninterest charges, holds total expenditures for all other purposes below\r\nthis year's level.\r\n\r\nThis requires the reduction or postponement of many desirable programs, the\r\nabsorption of a large part of last year's Federal pay raise through\r\npersonnel and other economies, the termination of certain installations and\r\nprojects, and the substitution in several programs of private for public\r\ncredit. But I am convinced that the enactment this year of tax reduction\r\nand tax reform overshadows all other domestic problems in this Congress.\r\nFor we cannot for long lead the cause of peace and freedom, if we ever\r\ncease to set the pace here at home.\r\n\r\n                                  II.\r\n\r\nTax reduction alone, however, is not enough to strengthen our society, to\r\nprovide opportunities for the four million Americans who are born every\r\nyear, to improve the lives of 32 million Americans who live on the\r\noutskirts of poverty.\r\n\r\nThe quality of American life must keep pace with the quantity of American\r\ngoods.\r\n\r\nThis country cannot afford to be materially rich and spiritually poor.\r\n\r\nTherefore, by holding down the budgetary cost of existing programs to keep\r\nwithin the limitations I have set, it is both possible and imperative to\r\nadopt other new measures that we cannot afford to postpone.\r\n\r\nThese measures are based on a series of fundamental premises, grouped under\r\nfour related headings:\r\n\r\nFirst, we need to strengthen our Nation by investing in our youth.\r\n\r\nThe future of any country which is dependent upon the will and wisdom of\r\nits citizens is damaged, and irreparably damaged, whenever any of its\r\nchildren is not educated to the full extent of his talent, from grade\r\nschool through graduate school. Today, an estimated 4 out of every 10\r\nstudents in the 5th grade will not even finish high school--and that is a\r\nwaste we cannot afford.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there is no reason why one million young Americans, out of\r\nschool and out of work, should all remain unwanted and often untrained on\r\nour city streets when their energies can be put to good use.\r\n\r\nFinally, the overseas success of our Peace Corps volunteers, most of them\r\nyoung men and women carrying skills and ideas to needy people, suggests the\r\nmerit of a similar corps serving our own community needs: in mental\r\nhospitals, on Indian reservations, in centers for the aged or for young\r\ndelinquents, in schools for the illiterate or the handicapped. As the\r\nidealism of our youth has served world peace, so can it serve the domestic\r\ntranquility.\r\n\r\nSecond, we need to strengthen our Nation by safeguarding its health.\r\n\r\nOur working men and women, instead of being forced to beg for help from\r\npublic charity once they are old and ill, should start contributing now to\r\ntheir own retirement health program through the Social Security System.\r\n\r\nMoreover, all our miracles of medical research will count for little if\r\nwe cannot reverse the growing nationwide shortage of doctors, dentists, and\r\nnurses, and the widespread shortages of nursing homes and modern urban\r\nhospital facilities. Merely to keep the present ratio of doctors and\r\ndentists from declining any further, we must over the next 10 years\r\nincrease the capacity of our medical schools by 50 percent and our dental\r\nschools by 100 percent.\r\n\r\nFinally, and of deep concern, I believe that the abandonment of the\r\nmentally ill and the mentally retarded to the grim mercy of custodial\r\ninstitutions too often inflicts on them and on their families a needless\r\ncruelty which this Nation should not endure. The incidence of mental\r\nretardation in this country is three times as high as that of Sweden, for\r\nexample--and that figure can and must be reduced.\r\n\r\nThird, we need to strengthen our Nation by protecting the basic rights of\r\nits citizens.\r\n\r\nThe right to competent counsel must be assured to every man accused of\r\ncrime in Federal court, regardless of his means.\r\n\r\nAnd the most precious and powerful right in the world, the right to vote\r\nin a free American election, must not be denied to any citizen on grounds\r\nof his race or color. I wish that all qualified Americans permitted to vote\r\nwere willing to vote, but surely in this centennial year of Emancipation\r\nall those who are willing to vote should always be permitted.\r\n\r\nFourth, we need to strengthen our Nation by making the best and the most\r\neconomical use of its resources and facilities.\r\n\r\nOur economic health depends on healthy transportation arteries; and I\r\nbelieve the way to a more modern, economical choice of national\r\ntransportation service is through increased competition and decreased\r\nregulation. Local mass transit, faring even worse, is as essential a\r\ncommunity service as hospitals and highways. Nearly three-fourths of our\r\ncitizens live in urban areas, which occupy only 2 percent of our land--and\r\nif local transit is to survive and relieve the congestion of these cities,\r\nit needs Federal stimulation and assistance.\r\n\r\nNext, this Government is in the storage and stockpile business to the\r\nmelancholy tune of more than $16 billion. We must continue to support farm\r\nincome, but we should not pile more farm surpluses on top of the $7.5\r\nbillion we already own. We must maintain a stockpile of strategic\r\nmaterials, but the $8.5 billion we have acquired--for reasons both good and\r\nbad--is much more than we need; and we should be empowered to dispose of\r\nthe excess in ways which will not cause market disruption.\r\n\r\nFinally, our already overcrowded national parks and recreation areas will\r\nhave twice as many visitors 10 years from now as they do today. If we do\r\nnot plan today for the future growth of these and other great natural\r\nassets--not only parks and forests but wildlife and wilderness preserves,\r\nand water projects of all kinds--our children and their children will be\r\npoorer in every sense of the word.\r\n\r\nThese are not domestic concerns alone. For upon our achievement of greater\r\nvitality and strength here at home hang our fate and future in the world:\r\nour ability to sustain and supply the security of free men and nations, our\r\nability to command their respect for our leadership, our ability to expand\r\nour trade without threat to our balance of payments, and our ability to\r\nadjust to the changing demands of cold war competition and challenge.\r\n\r\nWe shall be judged more by what we do at home than by what we preach\r\nabroad. Nothing we could do to help the developing countries would help\r\nthem half as much as a booming U.S. economy. And nothing our opponents\r\ncould do to encourage their own ambitions would encourage them half as much\r\nas a chronic, lagging U.S. economy. These domestic tasks do not divert\r\nenergy from our security--they provide the very foundation for freedom's\r\nsurvival and success.\r\n\r\n                                 III.\r\n\r\nTurning to the world outside, it was only a few years ago--in Southeast\r\nAsia, Africa, Eastern Europe, Latin America, even outer space--that\r\ncommunism sought to convey the image of a unified, confident, and expanding\r\nempire, closing in on a sluggish America and a free world in disarray. But\r\nfew people would hold to that picture today.\r\n\r\nIn these past months we have reaffirmed the scientific and military\r\nsuperiority of freedom. We have doubled our efforts in space, to assure us\r\nof being first in the future. We have undertaken the most far-reaching\r\ndefense improvements in the peacetime history of this country. And we have\r\nmaintained the frontiers of freedom from Viet-Nam to West Berlin.\r\n\r\nBut complacency or self-congratulation can imperil our security as much as\r\nthe weapons of tyranny. A moment of pause is not a promise of peace.\r\nDangerous problems remain from Cuba to the South China Sea. The world's\r\nprognosis prescribes, in short, not a year's vacation for us, but a year of\r\nobligation and opportunity.\r\n\r\nFour special avenues of opportunity stand out: the Atlantic Alliance, the\r\ndeveloping nations, the new Sino-Soviet difficulties, and the search for\r\nworldwide peace.\r\n\r\n                                 IV.\r\n\r\nFirst, how fares the grand alliance? Free Europe is entering into a new\r\nphase of its long and brilliant history. The era of colonial expansion has\r\npassed; the era of national rivalries is fading; and a new era of\r\ninterdependence and unity is taking shape. Defying the old prophecies of\r\nMarx, consenting to what no conqueror could ever compel, the free nations\r\nof Europe are moving toward a unity of purpose and power and policy in\r\nevery sphere of activity.\r\n\r\nFor 17 years this movement has had our consistent support, both political\r\nand economic. Far from resenting the new Europe, we regard her as a welcome\r\npartner, not a rival. For the road to world peace and freedom is still\r\nlong, and there are burdens which only full partners can share--in\r\nsupporting the common defense, in expanding world trade, in aligning our\r\nbalance of payments, in aiding the emergent nations, in concerting\r\npolitical and economic policies, and in welcoming to our common effort\r\nother industrialized nations, notably Japan, whose remarkable economic and\r\npolitical development of the 1950's permits it now to play on the world\r\nscene a major constructive role.\r\n\r\nNo doubt differences of opinion will continue to get more attention than\r\nagreements on action, as Europe moves from independence to more formal\r\ninterdependence. But these are honest differences among honorable\r\nassociates--more real and frequent, in fact, among our Western European\r\nallies than between them and the United States. For the unity of freedom\r\nhas never relied on uniformity of opinion. But the basic agreement of this\r\nalliance on fundamental issues continues.\r\n\r\nThe first task of the alliance remains the common defense. Last month Prime\r\nMinister Macmillan and I laid plans for a new stage in our long cooperative\r\neffort, one which aims to assist in the wider task of framing a common\r\nnuclear defense for the whole alliance.\r\n\r\nThe Nassau agreement recognizes that the security of the West is\r\nindivisible, and so must be our defense. But it also recognizes that this\r\nis an alliance of proud and sovereign nations, and works best when we do\r\nnot forget it. It recognizes further that the nuclear defense of the West\r\nis not a matter for the present nuclear powers alone--that France will be\r\nsuch a power in the future--and that ways must be found without increasing\r\nthe hazards of nuclear diffusion, to increase the role of our other\r\npartners in planning, manning, and directing a truly multilateral nuclear\r\nforce within an increasingly intimate NATO alliance. Finally, the Nassau\r\nagreement recognizes that nuclear defense is not enough, that the agreed\r\nNATO levels of conventional strength must be met, and that the alliance\r\ncannot afford to be in a position of having to answer every threat with\r\nnuclear weapons or nothing.\r\n\r\nWe remain too near the Nassau decisions, and too far from their full\r\nrealization, to know their place in history. But I believe that, for the\r\nfirst time, the door is open for the nuclear defense of the alliance to\r\nbecome a source of confidence, instead of a cause of contention.\r\n\r\nThe next most pressing concern of the alliance is our common economic goals\r\nof trade and growth. This Nation continues to be concerned about its\r\nbalance-of-payments deficit, which, despite its decline, remains a stubborn\r\nand troublesome problem. We believe, moreover, that closer economic ties\r\namong all free nations are essential to prosperity and peace. And neither\r\nwe nor the members of the European Common Market are so affluent that we\r\ncan long afford to shelter high cost farms or factories from the winds of\r\nforeign competition, or to restrict the channels of trade with other\r\nnations of the free world. If the Common Market should move toward\r\nprotectionism and restrictionism, it would undermine its own basic\r\nprinciples. This Government means to use the authority conferred on it last\r\nyear by the Congress to encourage trade expansion on both sides of the\r\nAtlantic and around the world.\r\n\r\n                                   V.\r\n\r\nSecond, what of the developing and non-aligned nations? They were shocked\r\nby the Soviets' sudden and secret attempt to transform Cuba into a nuclear\r\nstriking base--and by Communist China's arrogant invasion of India. They\r\nhave been reassured by our prompt assistance to India, by our support\r\nthrough the United Nations of the Congo's unification, by our patient\r\nsearch for disarmament, and by the improvement in our treatment of citizens\r\nand visitors whose skins do not happen to be white. And as the older\r\ncolonialism recedes, and the neo-colonialism of the Communist powers stands\r\nout more starkly than ever, they realize more clearly that the issue in the\r\nworld struggle is not communism versus capitalism, but coercion versus free\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\nThey are beginning to realize that the longing for independence is the same\r\nthe world over, whether it is the independence of West Berlin or Viet-Nam.\r\nThey are beginning to realize that such independence runs athwart all\r\nCommunist ambitions but is in keeping with our own--and that our approach\r\nto their diverse needs is resilient and resourceful, while the Communists\r\nare still relying on ancient doctrines and dogmas.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it is hard for any nation to focus on an external or\r\nsubversive threat to its independence when its energies are drained in\r\ndaily combat with the forces of poverty and despair. It makes little sense\r\nfor us to assail, in speeches and resolutions, the horrors of communism, to\r\nspend $50 billion a year to prevent its military advance--and then to\r\nbegrudge spending, largely on American products, less than one-tenth of\r\nthat amount to help other nations strengthen their independence and cure\r\nthe social chaos in which communism has always thrived.\r\n\r\nI am proud--and I think most Americans are proud--of a mutual defense and\r\nassistance program, evolved with bipartisan support in three\r\nadministrations, which has, with all its recognized problems, contributed\r\nto the fact that not a single one of the nearly fifty U.N. members to gain\r\nindependence since the Second World War has succumbed to Communist\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nI am proud of a program that has helped to arm and feed and clothe millions\r\nof people who live on the front lines of freedom.\r\n\r\nI am especially proud that this country has put forward for the 60's a vast\r\ncooperative effort to achieve economic growth and social progress\r\nthroughout the Americas--the Alliance for Progress.\r\n\r\nI do not underestimate the difficulties that we face in this mutual effort\r\namong our close neighbors, but the free states of this hemisphere, working\r\nin close collaboration, have begun to make this alliance a living reality.\r\nToday it is feeding one out of every four school age children in Latin\r\nAmerica an extra food ration from our farm surplus. It has distributed 1.5\r\nmillion school books and is building 17,000 classrooms. It has helped\r\nresettle tens of thousands of farm families on land they can call their\r\nown. It is stimulating our good neighbors to more self-help and\r\nself-reform--fiscal, social, institutional, and land reforms. It is\r\nbringing new housing and hope, new health and dignity, to millions who were\r\nforgotten. The men and women of this hemisphere know that the alliance\r\ncannot succeed if it is only another name for United States handouts--that\r\nit can succeed only as the Latin American nations themselves devote their\r\nbest effort to fulfilling its goals.\r\n\r\nThis story is the same in Africa, in the Middle East, and in Asia. Wherever\r\nnations are willing to help themselves, we stand ready to help them build\r\nnew bulwarks of freedom. We are not purchasing votes for the cold war; we\r\nhave gone to the aid of imperiled nations, neutrals and allies alike. What\r\nwe do ask--and all that we ask--is that our help be used to best advantage,\r\nand that their own efforts not be diverted by needless quarrels with other\r\nindependent nations.\r\n\r\nDespite all its past achievements, the continued progress of the Mutual\r\nAssistance Program requires a persistent discontent with present\r\nperformance. We have been reorganizing this program to make it a more\r\neffective, efficient instrument--and that process will continue this year.\r\n\r\nBut free world development will still be an uphill struggle. Government aid\r\ncan only supplement the role of private investment, trade expansion,\r\ncommodity stabilization, and, above all, internal self-improvement. The\r\nprocesses of growth are gradual--bearing fruit in a decade, not a day. Our\r\nsuccesses will be neither quick nor dramatic. But if these programs were\r\never to be ended, our failures in a dozen countries would be sudden and\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\nNeither money nor technical assistance, however, can be our only weapon\r\nagainst poverty. In the end, the crucial effort is one of purpose,\r\nrequiring the fuel of finance but also a torch of idealism. And nothing\r\ncarries the spirit of this American idealism more effectively to the far\r\ncorners of the earth than the American Peace Corps.\r\n\r\nA year ago, less than 900 Peace Corps volunteers were on the job. A year\r\nfrom now they will number more than 9,000--men and women, aged 18 to 79,\r\nwilling to give 2 years of their lives to helping people in other lands.\r\n\r\nThere are, in fact, nearly a million Americans serving their country and\r\nthe cause of freedom in overseas posts, a record no other people can match.\r\nSurely those of us who stay at home should be glad to help indirectly; by\r\nsupporting our aid programs; .by opening our doors to foreign visitors and\r\ndiplomats and students; and by proving, day by day, by deed as well as\r\nword, that we are a just and generous people.\r\n\r\n                                  VI.\r\n\r\nThird, what comfort can we take from the increasing strains and tensions\r\nwithin the Communist bloc? Here hope must be tempered with caution. For the\r\nSoviet-Chinese disagreement is over means, not ends. A dispute over how\r\nbest to bury the free world is no grounds for Western rejoicing.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, while a strain is not a fracture, it is clear that the forces\r\nof diversity are at work inside the Communist camp, despite all the iron\r\ndisciplines of regimentation and all the iron dogmatisms of ideology. Marx\r\nis proven wrong once again: for it is the closed Communist societies, not\r\nthe free and open societies which carry within themselves the seeds of\r\ninternal disintegration.\r\n\r\nThe disarray of the Communist empire has been heightened by two other\r\nformidable forces. One is the historical force of nationalism--and the\r\nyearning of all men to be free. The other is the gross inefficiency of\r\ntheir economies. For a closed society is not open to ideas of progress--and\r\na police state finds that it cannot command the grain to grow.\r\n\r\nNew nations asked to choose between two competing systems need only compare\r\nconditions in East and West Germany, Eastern and Western Europe, North and\r\nSouth Viet-Nam. They need only compare the disillusionment of Communist\r\nCuba with the promise of the Alliance for Progress. And all the world knows\r\nthat no successful system builds a wall to keep its people in and freedom\r\nout--and the wall of shame dividing Berlin is a symbol of Communist\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\n                                 VII.\r\n\r\nFinally, what can we do to move from the present pause toward enduring\r\npeace? Again I would counsel caution. I foresee no spectacular reversal in\r\nCommunist methods or goals. But if all these trends and developments can\r\npersuade the Soviet Union to walk the path of peace, then let her know that\r\nall free nations will journey with her. But until that choice is made, and\r\nuntil the world can develop a reliable system of international security,\r\nthe free peoples have no choice but to keep their arms nearby.\r\n\r\nThis country, therefore, continues to require the best defense in the\r\nworld--a defense which is suited to the sixties. This means, unfortunately,\r\na rising defense budget--for there is no substitute for adequate defense,\r\nand no \"bargain basement\" way of achieving it. It means the expenditure of\r\nmore than $15 billion this year on nuclear weapons systems alone, a sum\r\nwhich is about equal to the combined defense budgets of our European\r\nAllies.\r\n\r\nBut it also means improved air and missile defenses, improved civil\r\ndefense, a strengthened anti-guerrilla capacity and, of prime importance,\r\nmore powerful and flexible non-nuclear forces. For threats of massive\r\nretaliation may not deter piecemeal aggression--and a line of destroyers in\r\na quarantine, or a division of well-equipped men on a border, may be more\r\nuseful to our real security than the multiplication of awesome weapons\r\nbeyond all rational need.\r\n\r\nBut our commitment to national safety is not a commitment to expand our\r\nmilitary establishment indefinitely. We do not dismiss disarmament as\r\nmerely an idle dream. For we believe that, in the end, it is the only way\r\nto assure the security of all without impairing the interests of any. Nor\r\ndo we mistake honorable negotiation for appeasement. While we shall never\r\nweary in the defense of freedom, neither shall we ever abandon the pursuit\r\nof peace.\r\n\r\nIn this quest, the United Nations requires our full and continued support.\r\nIts value in serving the cause of peace has been shown anew in its role in\r\nthe West New Guinea settlement, in its use as a forum for the Cuban crisis,\r\nand in its task of unification in the Congo. Today the United Nations is\r\nprimarily the protector of the small and the weak, and a safety valve for\r\nthe strong. Tomorrow it can form the framework for a world of law--a world\r\nin which no nation dictates the destiny of another, and in which the vast\r\nresources now devoted to destructive means will serve constructive ends.\r\n\r\nIn short, let our adversaries choose. If they choose peaceful competition,\r\nthey shall have it. If they come to realize that their ambitions cannot\r\nsucceed--if they see their \"wars of liberation\" and subversion will\r\nultimately fail--if they recognize that there is more security in accepting\r\ninspection than in permitting new nations to master the black arts of\r\nnuclear war--and if they are willing to turn their energies, as we are, to\r\nthe great unfinished tasks of our own peoples--then, surely, the areas of\r\nagreement can be very wide indeed: a clear understanding about Berlin,\r\nstability in Southeast Asia, an end to nuclear testing, new checks on\r\nsurprise or accidental attack, and, ultimately, general and complete\r\ndisarmament.\r\n\r\n                                 VIII.\r\n\r\nFor we seek not the worldwide victory of one nation or system but a\r\nworldwide victory of man. The modern globe is too small, its weapons are\r\ntoo destructive, and its disorders are too contagious to permit any other\r\nkind of victory.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this end, the United States will continue to spend a greater\r\nportion of its national production than any other people in the free world.\r\nFor 15 years no other free nation has demanded so much of itself. Through\r\nhot wars and cold, through recession and prosperity, through the ages of\r\nthe atom and outer space, the American people have never faltered and their\r\nfaith has never flagged. If at times our actions seem to make life\r\ndifficult for others, it is only because history has made life difficult\r\nfor us all.\r\n\r\nBut difficult days need not be dark. I think these are proud and memorable\r\ndays in the cause of peace and freedom. We are proud, for example, of Major\r\nRudolf Anderson who gave his life over the island of Cuba. We salute\r\nSpecialist James Allen Johnson who died on the border of South Korea. We\r\npay honor to Sergeant Gerald Pendell who was killed in Viet-Nam. They are\r\namong the many who in this century, far from home, have died for our\r\ncountry. Our task now, and the task of all Americans is to live up to their\r\ncommitment.\r\n\r\nMy friends: I close on a note of hope. We are not lulled by the momentary\r\ncalm of the sea or the somewhat clearer skies above. We know the turbulence\r\nthat lies below, and the storms that are beyond the horizon this year. But\r\nnow the winds of change appear to be blowing more strongly than ever, in\r\nthe world of communism as well as our own. For 175 years we have sailed\r\nwith those winds at our back, and with the tides of human freedom in our\r\nfavor. We steer our ship with hope, as Thomas Jefferson said, \"leaving Fear\r\nastern.\"\r\n\r\nToday we still welcome those winds of change--and we have every reason to\r\nbelieve that our tide is running strong. With thanks to Almighty God for\r\nseeing us through a perilous passage, we ask His help anew in guiding the\r\n\"Good Ship Union.\"",
