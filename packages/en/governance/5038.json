Roosevelt\r\nJanuary 3, 1934\r\n\r\nMr. President, Mr. Speaker, Senators and Representatives in Congress:\r\n\r\nI come before you at the opening of the Regular Session of the 73d\r\nCongress, not to make requests for special or detailed items of\r\nlegislation; I come, rather, to counsel with you, who, like myself, have\r\nbeen selected to carry out a mandate of the whole people, in order that\r\nwithout partisanship you and I may cooperate to continue the restoration of\r\nour national wellbeing and, equally important, to build on the ruins of the\r\npast a new structure designed better to meet the present problems of modern\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nSuch a structure includes not only the relations of industry and\r\nagriculture and finance to each other but also the effect which all of\r\nthese three have on our individual citizens and on the whole people as a\r\nNation.\r\n\r\nNow that we are definitely in the process of recovery, lines have been\r\nrightly drawn between those to whom this recovery means a return to old\r\nmethods--and the number of these people is small--and those for whom\r\nrecovery means a reform of many old methods, a permanent readjustment of\r\nmany of our ways of thinking and therefore of many of our social and\r\neconomic arrangements. . . . .\r\n\r\nCivilization cannot go back; civilization must not stand still. We have\r\nundertaken new methods. It is our task to perfect, to improve, to alter\r\nwhen necessary, but in all cases to go forward. To consolidate what we are\r\ndoing, to make our economic and social structure capable of dealing with\r\nmodern life is the joint task of the legislative, the judicial, and the\r\nexecutive branches of the national Government.\r\n\r\nWithout regard to party, the overwhelming majority of our people seek a\r\ngreater opportunity for humanity to prosper and find happiness. They\r\nrecognize that human welfare has not increased and does not increase\r\nthrough mere materialism and luxury, but that it does progress through\r\nintegrity, unselfishness, responsibility and justice.\r\n\r\nIn the past few months, as a result of our action, we have demanded of many\r\ncitizens that they surrender certain licenses to do as they please in\r\ntheir business relationships; but we have asked this in exchange for the\r\nprotection which the State can give against exploitation by their fellow\r\nmen or by combinations of their fellow men.\r\n\r\nI congratulate this Congress upon the courage, the earnestness and the\r\nefficiency with which you met the crisis at the Special Session. It was\r\nyour fine understanding of the national problem that furnished the example\r\nwhich the country has so splendidly followed. I venture to say that the\r\ntask confronting the First Congress of 1789 was no greater than your own.\r\n\r\nI shall not attempt to set forth either the many phases of the crisis which\r\nwe experienced last March, or the many measures which you and I undertook\r\nduring the Special Session that we might initiate recovery and reform.\r\n\r\nIt is sufficient that I should speak in broad terms of the results of our\r\ncommon counsel. The credit of the Government has been fortified by drastic\r\nreduction in the cost of its permanent agencies through the Economy Act.\r\n\r\nWith the twofold purpose of strengthening the whole financial structure and\r\nof arriving eventually at a medium of exchange which over the years will\r\nhave less variable purchasing and debt paying power for our people than\r\nthat of the past, I have used the authority granted me to purchase all\r\nAmerican-produced gold and silver and to buy additional gold in the world\r\nmarkets. Careful investigation and constant study prove that in the matter\r\nof foreign exchange rates certain of our sister Nations find themselves so\r\nhandicapped by internal and other conditions that they feel unable at this\r\ntime to enter into stabilization discussion based on permanent and\r\nworld-wide objectives.\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming majority of the banks, both national and State, which\r\nreopened last spring, are in sound condition and have been brought within\r\nthe protection of Federal insurance. In the case of those banks which were\r\nnot permitted to reopen, nearly six hundred million dollars of frozen\r\ndeposits are being restored to the depositors through the assistance of the\r\nnational Government.\r\n\r\nWe have made great strides toward the objectives of the National Industrial\r\nRecovery Act, for not only have several millions of our unemployed been\r\nrestored to work, but industry is organizing itself with a greater\r\nunderstanding that reasonable profits can be earned while at the same time\r\nprotection can be assured to guarantee to labor adequate pay and proper\r\nconditions of work. Child labor is abolished. Uniform standards of hours\r\nand wages apply today to 95 percent of industrial employment within the\r\nfield of the National Industrial Recovery Act. We seek the definite end of\r\npreventing combinations in furtherance of monopoly and in restraint of\r\ntrade, while at the same time we seek to prevent ruinous rivalries within\r\nindustrial groups which in many cases resemble the gang wars of the\r\nunderworld and in which the real victim in every case is the public\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nUnder the authority of this Congress, we have brought the component parts\r\nof each industry together around a common table, just as we have brought\r\nproblems affecting labor to a common meeting ground. Though the machinery,\r\nhurriedly devised, may need readjustment from time to time, nevertheless I\r\nthink you will agree with me that we have created a permanent feature of\r\nour modernized industrial structure and that it will continue under the\r\nsupervision but not the arbitrary dictation of Government itself.\r\n\r\nYou recognized last spring that the most serious part of the debt burden\r\naffected those who stood in danger of losing their farms and their homes. I\r\nam glad to tell you that refinancing in both of these cases is proceeding\r\nwith good success and in all probability within the financial limits set by\r\nthe Congress.\r\n\r\nBut agriculture had suffered from more than its debts. Actual experience\r\nwith the operation of the Agricultural Adjustment Act leads to my belief\r\nthat thus far the experiment of seeking a balance between production and\r\nconsumption is succeeding and has made progress entirely in line with\r\nreasonable expectations toward the restoration of farm prices to parity. I\r\ncontinue in my conviction that industrial progress and prosperity can only\r\nbe attained by bringing the purchasing power of that portion of our\r\npopulation which in one form or another is dependent upon agriculture up to\r\na level which will restore a proper balance between every section of the\r\ncountry and between every form of work.\r\n\r\nIn this field, through carefully planned flood control, power development\r\nand land-use policies in the Tennessee Valley and in other, great\r\nwatersheds, we are seeking the elimination of waste, the removal of poor\r\nlands from agriculture and the encouragement of small local industries,\r\nthus furthering this principle of a better balanced national life. We\r\nrecognize the great ultimate cost of the application of this rounded policy\r\nto every part off the Union. Today we are creating heavy obligations to\r\nstart the work because of the great unemployment needs of the moment. I\r\nlook forward, however, to the time in the not distant future, when annual\r\nappropriations, wholly covered by current revenue, will enable the work to\r\nproceed under a national plan. Such a national plan will, in a generation\r\nor two, return many times the money spent on it; more important, it will\r\neliminate the use of inefficient tools, conserve and increase natural\r\nresources, prevent waste, and enable millions of our people to take better\r\nadvantage of the opportunities which God has given our country.\r\n\r\nI cannot, unfortunately, present to you a picture of complete optimism\r\nregarding world affairs.\r\n\r\nThe delegation representing the United States has worked in close\r\ncooperation with the other American Republics assembled at Montevideo to\r\nmake that conference an outstanding success. We have, I hope, made it clear\r\nto our neighbors that we seek with them future avoidance of territorial\r\nexpansion and of interference by one Nation in the internal affairs of\r\nanother. Furthermore, all of us are seeking the restoration of commerce in\r\nways which will preclude the building up of large favorable trade balances\r\nby any one Nation at the expense of trade debits on the part of other\r\nNations.\r\n\r\nIn other parts of the world, however, fear of immediate or future\r\naggression and with it the spending of vast sums on armament and the\r\ncontinued building up of defensive trade barriers prevent any great\r\nprogress in peace or trade agreements. I have made it clear that the United\r\nStates cannot take part in political arrangements in Europe but that we\r\nstand ready to cooperate at any time in practicable measures on a world\r\nbasis looking to immediate reduction of armaments and the lowering of the\r\nbarriers against commerce.\r\n\r\nI expect to report to you later in regard to debts owed the Government and\r\npeople of this country by the Governments and peoples of other countries.\r\nSeveral Nations, acknowledging the debt, have paid in small part; other\r\nNations have failed to pay. One Nation--Finland--has paid the installments\r\ndue this country in full.\r\n\r\nReturning to home problems, we have been shocked by many notorious examples\r\nof injuries done our citizens by persons or groups who have been living off\r\ntheir neighbors by the use of methods either unethical or criminal.\r\n\r\nIn the first category--a field which does not involve violations of the\r\nletter of our laws--practices have been brought to light which have shocked\r\nthose who believed that we were in the past generation raising the ethical\r\nstandards of business. They call for stringent preventive or regulatory\r\nmeasures. I am speaking of those individuals who have evaded the spirit and\r\npurpose of our tax laws, of those high officials of banks or corporations\r\nwho have grown rich at the expense of their stockholders or the public, of\r\nthose reckless speculators with their own or other people's money whose\r\noperations have injured the values of the farmers' crops and the savings\r\nof the poor.\r\n\r\nIn the other category, crimes of organized banditry, coldblooded shooting,\r\nlynching and kidnapping have threatened our security.\r\n\r\nThese violations of ethics and these violations of law call on the strong\r\narm of Government for their immediate suppression; they call also on the\r\ncountry for an aroused public opinion.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of the Twenty-first Amendment should give material aid to the\r\nelimination of those new forms of crime which came from the illegal traffic\r\nin liquor.\r\n\r\nI shall continue to regard it as my duty to use whatever means may be\r\nnecessary to supplement State, local and private agencies for the relief of\r\nsuffering caused by unemployment. With respect to this question, I have\r\nrecognized the dangers inherent in the direct giving of relief and have\r\nsought the means to provide not mere relief, but the opportunity for useful\r\nand remunerative work. We shall, in the process of recovery, seek to move\r\nas rapidly as possible from direct relief to publicly supported work and\r\nfrom that to the rapid restoration of private employment.\r\n\r\nIt is to the eternal credit of the American people that this tremendous\r\nreadjustment of our national life is being accomplished peacefully, without\r\nserious dislocation, with only a minimum of injustice and with a great,\r\nwilling spirit of cooperation throughout the country.\r\n\r\nDisorder is not an American habit. Self-help and self-control are the\r\nessence of the American tradition--not of necessity the form of that\r\ntradition, but its spirit. The program itself comes from the American\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIt is an integrated program, national in scope. Viewed in the large, it is\r\ndesigned to save from destruction and to keep for the future the genuinely\r\nimportant values created by modern society. The vicious and wasteful parts\r\nof that society we could not save if we wished; they have chosen the way of\r\nself-destruction. We would save useful mechanical invention, machine\r\nproduction, industrial efficiency, modern means of communication, broad\r\neducation. We would save and encourage the slowly growing impulse among\r\nconsumers to enter the industrial market place equipped with sufficient\r\norganization to insist upon fair prices and honest sales.\r\n\r\nBut the unnecessary expansion of industrial plants, the waste of natural\r\nresources, the exploitation of the consumers of natural monopolies, the\r\naccumulation of stagnant surpluses, child labor, and the ruthless\r\nexploitation of all labor, the encouragement of speculation with other\r\npeople's money, these were consumed in the fires that they themselves\r\nkindled; we must make sure that as we reconstruct our life there be no soil\r\nin which such weeds can grow again.\r\n\r\nWe have plowed the furrow and planted the good seed; the hard beginning is\r\nover. If we would reap the full harvest, we must cultivate the soil where\r\nthis good seed is sprouting and the plant is reaching up to mature growth.\r\n\r\nA final personal word. I know that each of you will appreciate that. I am\r\nspeaking no mere politeness when I assure you how much I value the fine\r\nrelationship that we have shared during these months of hard and incessant\r\nwork. Out of these friendly contacts we are, fortunately, building a strong\r\nand permanent tie between the legislative and executive branches of the\r\nGovernment. The letter of the Constitution wisely declared a separation,\r\nbut the impulse of common purpose declares a union. In this spirit we join\r\nonce more in serving the American people.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\r\nJanuary 4, 1935\r\n\r\nMr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Senate and of the House of\r\nRepresentatives:\r\n\r\nThe Constitution wisely provides that the Chief Executive shall report to\r\nthe Congress on the state of the Union, for through you, the chosen\r\nlegislative representatives, our citizens everywhere may fairly judge the\r\nprogress of our governing. I am confident that today, in the light of the\r\nevents of the past two years, you do not consider it merely a trite phrase\r\nwhen I tell you that I am truly glad to greet you and that I look forward\r\nto common counsel, to useful cooperation, and to genuine friendships\r\nbetween us.\r\n\r\nWe have undertaken a new order of things; yet we progress to it under the\r\nframework and in the spirit and intent of the American Constitution. We\r\nhave proceeded throughout the Nation a measurable distance on the road\r\ntoward this new order. Materially, I can report to you substantial benefits\r\nto our agricultural population, increased industrial activity, and profits\r\nto our merchants. Of equal moment, there is evident a restoration of that\r\nspirit of confidence and faith which marks the American character. Let him,\r\nwho, for speculative profit or partisan purpose, without just warrant would\r\nseek to disturb or dispel this assurance, take heed before he assumes\r\nresponsibility for any act which slows our onward steps.\r\n\r\nThroughout the world, change is the order of the day. In every Nation\r\neconomic problems, long in the making, have brought crises of many kinds\r\nfor which the masters of old practice and theory were unprepared. In most\r\nNations social justice, no longer a distant ideal, has become a definite\r\ngoal, and ancient Governments are beginning to heed the call.\r\n\r\nThus, the American people do not stand alone in the world in their desire\r\nfor change. We seek it through tested liberal traditions, through processes\r\nwhich retain all of the deep essentials of that republican form of\r\nrepresentative government first given to a troubled world by the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nAs the various parts in the program begun in the Extraordinary Session of\r\nthe 73rd Congress shape themselves in practical administration, the unity\r\nof our program reveals itself to the Nation. The outlines of the new\r\neconomic order, rising from the disintegration of the old, are apparent. We\r\ntest what we have done as our measures take root in the living texture of\r\nlife. We see where we have built wisely and where we can do still better.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to make a distinction between recovery and reform is a narrowly\r\nconceived effort to substitute the appearance of reality for reality\r\nitself. When a man is convalescing from illness, wisdom dictates not only\r\ncure of the symptoms, but also removal of their cause.\r\n\r\nIt is important to recognize that while we seek to outlaw specific abuses,\r\nthe American objective of today has an infinitely deeper, finer and more\r\nlasting purpose than mere repression. Thinking people in almost every\r\ncountry of the world have come to realize certain fundamental difficulties\r\nwith which civilization must reckon. Rapid changes--the machine age, the\r\nadvent of universal and rapid communication and many other new factors--have\r\nbrought new problems. Succeeding generations have attempted to keep pace by\r\nreforming in piecemeal fashion this or that attendant abuse. As a result,\r\nevils overlap and reform becomes confused and frustrated. We lose sight,\r\nfrom time to time, of our ultimate human objectives.\r\n\r\nLet us, for a moment, strip from our simple purpose the confusion that\r\nresults from a multiplicity of detail and from millions of written and\r\nspoken words.\r\n\r\nWe find our population suffering from old inequalities, little changed by\r\nvast sporadic remedies. In spite of our efforts and in spite of our talk,\r\nwe have not weeded out the over privileged and we have not effectively\r\nlifted up the underprivileged. Both of these manifestations of injustice\r\nhave retarded happiness. No wise man has any intention of destroying what\r\nis known as the profit motive; because by the profit motive we mean the\r\nright by work to earn a decent livelihood for ourselves and for our\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nWe have, however, a clear mandate from the people, that Americans must\r\nforswear that conception of the acquisition of wealth which, through\r\nexcessive profits, creates undue private power over private affairs and, to\r\nour misfortune, over public affairs as well. In building toward this end we\r\ndo not destroy ambition, nor do we seek to divide our wealth into equal\r\nshares on stated occasions. We continue to recognize the greater ability of\r\nsome to earn more than others. But we do assert that the ambition of the\r\nindividual to obtain for him and his a proper security, a reasonable\r\nleisure, and a decent living throughout life, is an ambition to be\r\npreferred to the appetite for great wealth and great power.\r\n\r\nI recall to your attention my message to the Congress last June in which I\r\nsaid: \"among our objectives I place the security of the men, women and\r\nchildren of the Nation first.\" That remains our first and continuing task;\r\nand in a very real sense every major legislative enactment of this Congress\r\nshould be a component part of it.\r\n\r\nIn defining immediate factors which enter into our quest, I have spoken to\r\nthe Congress and the people of three great divisions:\r\n\r\n1. The security of a livelihood through the better use of the national\r\nresources of the land in which we live.\r\n\r\n2. The security against the major hazards and vicissitudes of life.\r\n\r\n3. The security of decent homes.\r\n\r\nI am now ready to submit to the Congress a broad program designed\r\nultimately to establish all three of these factors of security--a program\r\nwhich because of many lost years will take many future years to fulfill.\r\n\r\nA study of our national resources, more comprehensive than any previously\r\nmade, shows the vast amount of necessary and practicable work which needs\r\nto be done for the development and preservation of our natural wealth for\r\nthe enjoyment and advantage of our people in generations to come. The sound\r\nuse of land and water is far more comprehensive than the mere planting of\r\ntrees, building of dams, distributing of electricity or retirement of\r\nsub-marginal land. It recognizes that stranded populations, either in the\r\ncountry or the city, cannot have security under the conditions that now\r\nsurround them.\r\n\r\nTo this end we are ready to begin to meet this problem--the intelligent care\r\nof population throughout our Nation, in accordance with an intelligent\r\ndistribution of the means of livelihood for that population. A definite\r\nprogram for putting people to work, of which I shall speak in a moment, is\r\na component part of this greater program of security of livelihood through\r\nthe better use of our national resources.\r\n\r\nClosely related to the broad problem of livelihood is that of security\r\nagainst the major hazards of life. Here also, a comprehensive survey of\r\nwhat has been attempted or accomplished in many Nations and in many States\r\nproves to me that the time has come for action by the national Government.\r\nI shall send to you, in a few days, definite recommendations based on these\r\nstudies. These recommendations will cover the broad subjects of\r\nunemployment insurance and old age insurance, of benefits for children,\r\nform others, for the handicapped, for maternity care and for other aspects\r\nof dependency and illness where a beginning can now be made.\r\n\r\nThe third factor--better homes for our people--has also been the subject of\r\nexperimentation and study. Here, too, the first practical steps can be made\r\nthrough the proposals which I shall suggest in relation to giving work to\r\nthe unemployed.\r\n\r\nWhatever we plan and whatever we do should be in the light of these three\r\nclear objectives of security. We cannot afford to lose valuable time in\r\nhaphazard public policies which cannot find a place in the broad outlines\r\nof these major purposes. In that spirit I come to an immediate issue made\r\nfor us by hard and inescapable circumstance--the task of putting people to\r\nwork. In the spring of 1933 the issue of destitution seemed to stand apart;\r\ntoday, in the light of our experience and our new national policy, we find\r\nwe can put people to work in ways which conform to, initiate and carry\r\nforward the broad principles of that policy.\r\n\r\nThe first objectives of emergency legislation of 1933 were to relieve\r\ndestitution, to make it possible for industry to operate in a more rational\r\nand orderly fashion, and to put behind industrial recovery the impulse of\r\nlarge expenditures in Government undertakings. The purpose of the National\r\nIndustrial Recovery Act to provide work for more people succeeded in a\r\nsubstantial manner within the first few months of its life, and the Act has\r\ncontinued to maintain employment gains and greatly improved working\r\nconditions in industry.\r\n\r\nThe program of public works provided for in the Recovery Act launched the\r\nFederal Government into a task for which there was little time to make\r\npreparation and little American experience to follow. Great employment has\r\nbeen given and is being given by these works.\r\n\r\nMore than two billions of dollars have also been expended in direct relief\r\nto the destitute. Local agencies of necessity determined the recipients of\r\nthis form of relief. With inevitable exceptions the funds were spent by\r\nthem with reasonable efficiency and as a result actual want of food and\r\nclothing in the great majority of cases has been overcome.\r\n\r\nBut the stark fact before us is that great numbers still remain\r\nunemployed.\r\n\r\nA large proportion of these unemployed and their dependents have been\r\nforced on the relief rolls. The burden on the Federal Government has grown\r\nwith great rapidity. We have here a human as well as an economic problem.\r\nWhen humane considerations are concerned, Americans give them precedence.\r\nThe lessons of history, confirmed by the evidence immediately before me,\r\nshow conclusively that continued dependence upon relief induces a spiritual\r\nand moral disintegration fundamentally destructive to the national fibre.\r\nTo dole out relief in this way is to administer a narcotic, a subtle\r\ndestroyer of the human spirit. It is inimical to the dictates of sound\r\npolicy. It is in violation of the traditions of America. Work must be found\r\nfor able-bodied but destitute workers.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Government must and shall quit this business of relief.\r\n\r\nI am not willing that the vitality of our people be further sapped by the\r\ngiving of cash, of market baskets, of a few hours of weekly work cutting\r\ngrass, raking leaves or picking up .papers in the public parks. We must\r\npreserve not only the bodies of the unemployed from destitution but also\r\ntheir self-respect, their self-reliance and courage and determination. This\r\ndecision brings me to the problem of what the Government should do with\r\napproximately five million unemployed now on the relief rolls.\r\n\r\nAbout one million and a half of these belong to the group which in the past\r\nwas dependent upon local welfare efforts. Most of them are unable for one\r\nreason or another to maintain themselves independently--for the most part,\r\nthrough no fault of their own. Such people, in the days before the great\r\ndepression, were cared for by local efforts--by States, by counties, by\r\ntowns, by cities, by churches and by private welfare agencies. It is my\r\nthought that in the future they must be cared for as they were before. I\r\nstand ready through my own personal efforts, and through the public\r\ninfluence of the office that I hold, to help these local agencies to get\r\nthe means necessary to assume this burden.\r\n\r\nThe security legislation which I shall propose to the Congress will, I am\r\nconfident, be of assistance to local effort in the care of this type of\r\ncases. Local responsibility can and will be resumed, for, after all, common\r\nsense tells us that the wealth necessary for this task existed and still\r\nexists in the local community, and the dictates of sound administration\r\nrequire that this responsibility be in the first instance a local one.\r\nThere are, however, an additional three and one half million employable\r\npeople who are on relief. With them the problem is different and the\r\nresponsibility is different. This group was the victim of a nation-wide\r\ndepression caused by conditions which were not local but national. The\r\nFederal Government is the only governmental agency with sufficient power\r\nand credit to meet this situation. We have assumed this task and we shall\r\nnot shrink from it in the future. It is a duty dictated by every\r\nintelligent consideration of national policy to ask you to make it possible\r\nfor the United States to give employment to all of these three and one half\r\nmillion employable people now on relief, pending their absorption in a\r\nrising tide of private employment.\r\n\r\nIt is my thought that with the exception of certain of the normal public\r\nbuilding operations of the Government, all emergency public works shall be\r\nunited in a single new and greatly enlarged plan.\r\n\r\nWith the establishment of this new system we can supersede the Federal\r\nEmergency Relief Administration with a coordinated authority which will be\r\ncharged with the orderly liquidation of our present relief activities and\r\nthe substitution of a national chart for the giving of work.\r\n\r\nThis new program of emergency public employment should be governed by a\r\nnumber of practical principles.\r\n\r\n(1) All work undertaken should be useful--not just for a day, or a year,\r\nbut useful in the sense that it affords permanent improvement in living\r\nconditions or that it creates future new wealth for the Nation.\r\n\r\n(2) Compensation on emergency public projects should be in the form of\r\nsecurity payments which should be larger than the amount now received as a\r\nrelief dole, but at the same time not so large as to encourage the\r\nrejection of opportunities for private employment or the leaving of private\r\nemployment to engage in Government work.\r\n\r\n(3) Projects should be undertaken on which a large percentage of direct\r\nlabor can be used.\r\n\r\n(4) Preference should be given to those projects which will be\r\nself-liquidating in the sense that there is a reasonable expectation that\r\nthe Government will get its money back at some future time.\r\n\r\n(5) The projects undertaken should be selected and planned so as to compete\r\nas little as possible with private enterprises. This suggests that if it\r\nwere not for the necessity of giving useful work to the unemployed now on\r\nrelief, these projects in most instances would not now be undertaken.\r\n\r\n(6) The planning of projects would seek to assure work during the coming\r\nfiscal year to the individuals now on relief, or until such time as private\r\nemployment is available. In order to make adjustment to increasing private\r\nemployment, work should be planned with a view to tapering it off in\r\nproportion to the speed with which the emergency workers are offered\r\npositions with private employers.\r\n\r\n(7) Effort should be made to locate projects where they will serve the\r\ngreatest unemployment needs as shown by present relief rolls, and the broad\r\nprogram of the National Resources Board should be freely used for guidance\r\nin selection. Our ultimate objective being the enrichment of human lives,\r\nthe Government has the primary duty to use its emergency expenditures as\r\nmuch as possible to serve those who cannot secure the advantages of private\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nEver since the adjournment of the 73d Congress, the Administration has been\r\nstudying from every angle the possibility and the practicability of new\r\nforms of employment. As a result of these studies I have arrived at certain\r\nvery definite convictions as to the amount of money that will be necessary\r\nfor the sort of public projects that I have described. I shall submit these\r\nfigures in my budget message. I assure you now they will be within the\r\nsound credit of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe work itself will cover a wide field including clearance of slums, which\r\nfor adequate reasons cannot be undertaken by private capital; in rural\r\nhousing of several kinds, where, again, private capital is unable to\r\nfunction; in rural electrification; in the reforestation of the great\r\nwatersheds of the Nation; in an intensified program to prevent soil erosion\r\nand to reclaim blighted areas; in improving existing road systems and in\r\nconstructing national highways designed to handle modern traffic; in the\r\nelimination of grade crossings; in the extension and enlargement of the\r\nsuccessful work of the Civilian Conservation Corps; in non-Federal works,\r\nmostly self-liquidating and highly useful to local divisions of Government;\r\nand on many other projects which the Nation needs and cannot afford to\r\nneglect.\r\n\r\nThis is the method which I propose to you in order that we may better meet\r\nthis present-day problem of unemployment. Its greatest advantage is that it\r\nfits logically and usefully into the long-range permanent policy of\r\nproviding the three types of security which constitute as a whole an\r\nAmerican plan for the betterment of the future of the American people.\r\n\r\nI shall consult with you from time to time concerning other measures of\r\nnational importance. Among the subjects that lie immediately before us are\r\nthe consolidation of Federal regulatory administration over all forms of\r\ntransportation, the renewal and clarification of the general purposes of\r\nthe National Industrial Recovery Act, the strengthening of our facilities\r\nfor the prevention, detection and treatment of crime and criminals, the\r\nrestoration of sound conditions in the public utilities field through\r\nabolition of the evil features of holding companies, the gradual tapering\r\noff of the emergency credit activities of Government, and improvement in\r\nour taxation forms and methods.\r\n\r\nWe have already begun to feel the bracing effect upon our economic system\r\nof a restored agriculture. The hundreds of millions of additional income\r\nthat farmers are receiving are finding their way into the channels of\r\ntrade. The farmers' share of the national income is slowly rising. The\r\neconomic facts justify the widespread opinion of those engaged in\r\nagriculture that our provisions for maintaining a balanced production give\r\nat this time the most adequate remedy for an old and vexing problem. For\r\nthe present, and especially in view of abnormal world conditions,\r\nagricultural adjustment with certain necessary improvements in methods\r\nshould continue.\r\n\r\nIt seems appropriate to call attention at this time to the fine spirit\r\nshown during the past year by our public servants. I cannot praise too\r\nhighly the cheerful work of the Civil Service employees, and of those\r\ntemporarily working for the Government. As for those thousands in our\r\nvarious public agencies spread throughout the country who, without\r\ncompensation, agreed to take over heavy responsibilities in connection with\r\nour various loan agencies and particularly in direct relief work, I cannot\r\nsay too much. I do not think any country could show a higher average of\r\ncheerful and even enthusiastic team-work than has been shown by these men\r\nand women.\r\n\r\nI cannot with candor tell you that general international relationships\r\noutside the borders of the United States are improved. On the surface of\r\nthings many old jealousies are resurrected, old passions aroused; new\r\nstrivings for armament and power, in more than one land, rear their ugly\r\nheads. I hope that calm counsel and constructive leadership will provide\r\nthe steadying influence and the time necessary for the coming of new and\r\nmore practical forms of representative government throughout the world\r\nwherein privilege and power will occupy a lesser place and world welfare a\r\ngreater.\r\n\r\nI believe, however, that our own peaceful and neighborly attitude toward\r\nother Nations is coming to be understood and appreciated. The maintenance\r\nof international peace is a matter in which we are deeply and unselfishly\r\nconcerned. Evidence of our persistent and undeniable desire to prevent\r\narmed conflict has recently been more than once afforded.\r\n\r\nThere is no ground for apprehension that our relations with any Nation will\r\nbe otherwise than peaceful. Nor is there ground for doubt that the people\r\nof most Nations seek relief from the threat and burden attaching to the\r\nfalse theory that extravagant armament cannot be reduced and limited by\r\ninternational accord.\r\n\r\nThe ledger of the past year shows many more gains than losses. Let us not\r\nforget that, in addition to saving millions from utter destitution, child\r\nlabor has been for the moment outlawed, thousands of homes saved to their\r\nowners and most important of all, the morale of the Nation has been\r\nrestored. Viewing the year 1934 as a whole, you and I can agree that we\r\nhave a generous measure of reasons for giving thanks.\r\n\r\nIt is not empty optimism that moves me to a strong hope in the coming year.\r\nWe can, if we will, make 1935 a genuine period of good feeling, sustained\r\nby a sense of purposeful progress. Beyond the material recovery, I sense a\r\nspiritual recovery as well. The people of America are turning as never\r\nbefore to those permanent values that are not limited to the physical\r\nobjectives of life. There are growing signs of this on every hand. In the\r\nface of these spiritual impulses we are sensible of the Divine Providence\r\nto which Nations turn now, as always, for guidance and fostering care.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\r\nJanuary 3, 1936\r\n\r\nMr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Senate and of the House of\r\nRepresentatives:\r\n\r\nWe are about to enter upon another year of the responsibility which the\r\nelectorate of the United States has placed in our hands. Having come so\r\nfar, it is fitting that we should pause to survey the ground which we have\r\ncovered and the path which lies ahead.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day of March, 1933, on the occasion of taking the oath of\r\noffice as President of the United States, I addressed the people of our\r\ncountry. Need I recall either the scene or the national circumstances\r\nattending the occasion? The crisis of that moment was almost exclusively a\r\nnational one. In recognition of that fact, so obvious to the millions in\r\nthe streets and in the homes of America, I devoted by far the greater part\r\nof that address to what I called, and the Nation called, critical days\r\nwithin our own borders.\r\n\r\nYou will remember that on that fourth of March, 1933, the world picture was\r\nan image of substantial peace. International consultation and widespread\r\nhope for the bettering of relations between the Nations gave to all of us a\r\nreasonable expectation that the barriers to mutual confidence, to increased\r\ntrade, and to the peaceful settlement of disputes could be progressively\r\nremoved. In fact, my only reference to the field of world policy in that\r\naddress was in these words: \"I would dedicate this Nation to the policy of\r\nthe good neighbor--the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and, because\r\nhe does so, respects the rights of others--a neighbor who respects his\r\nobligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements in and with a world\r\nof neighbors.\"\r\n\r\nIn the years that have followed, that sentiment has remained the dedication\r\nof this Nation. Among the Nations of the great Western Hemisphere the\r\npolicy of the good neighbor has happily prevailed. At no time in the four\r\nand a half centuries of modern civilization in the Americas has there\r\nexisted--in any year, in any decade, in any generation in all that time--a\r\ngreater spirit of mutual understanding, of common helpfulness, and of\r\ndevotion to the ideals of serf-government than exists today in the\r\ntwenty-one American Republics and their neighbor, the Dominion of Canada.\r\nThis policy of the good neighbor among the Americas is no longer a hope, no\r\nlonger an objective remaining to be accomplished. It is a fact, active,\r\npresent, pertinent and effective. In this achievement, every American\r\nNation takes an understanding part. There is neither war, nor rumor of war,\r\nnor desire for war. The inhabitants of this vast area, two hundred and\r\nfifty million strong, spreading more than eight thousand miles from the\r\nArctic to the Antarctic, believe in, and propose to follow, the policy of\r\nthe good neighbor. They wish with all their heart that the rest of the\r\nworld might do likewise.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the world--Ah! there is the rub.\r\n\r\nWere I today to deliver an Inaugural Address to the people of the United\r\nStates, I could not limit my comments on world affairs to one paragraph.\r\nWith much regret I should be compelled to devote the greater part to world\r\naffairs. Since the summer of that same year of 1933, the temper and the\r\npurposes of the rulers of many of the great populations in Europe and in\r\nAsia have not pointed the way either to peace or to good-will among men.\r\nNot only have peace and good-will among men grown more remote in those\r\nareas of the earth during this period, but a point has been reached where\r\nthe people of the Americas must take cognizance of growing ill-will, of\r\nmarked trends toward aggression, of increasing armaments, of shortening\r\ntempers--a situation which has in it many of the elements that lead to the\r\ntragedy of general war.\r\n\r\nOn those other continents many Nations, principally the smaller peoples, if\r\nleft to themselves, would be content with their boundaries and willing to\r\nsolve within themselves and in cooperation with their neighbors their\r\nindividual problems, both economic and social. The rulers of those Nations,\r\ndeep in their hearts, follow these peaceful and reasonable aspirations of\r\ntheir peoples. These rulers must remain ever vigilant against the\r\npossibility today or tomorrow of invasion or attack by the rulers of other\r\npeoples who fail to subscribe to the principles of bettering the human race\r\nby peaceful means.\r\n\r\nWithin those other Nations--those which today must bear the primary,\r\ndefinite responsibility for jeopardizing world peace--what hope lies? To\r\nsay the least, there are grounds for pessimism. It is idle for us or for\r\nothers to preach that the masses of the people who constitute those Nations\r\nwhich are dominated by the twin spirits of autocracy and aggression, are\r\nout of sympathy with their rulers, that they are allowed no opportunity to\r\nexpress themselves, that they would change things if they could.\r\n\r\nThat, unfortunately, is not so clear. It might be true that the masses of\r\nthe people in those Nations would change the policies of their Governments\r\nif they could be allowed full freedom and full access to the processes of\r\ndemocratic government as we understand them. But they do not have that\r\naccess; lacking it they follow blindly and fervently the lead of those who\r\nseek autocratic power.\r\n\r\nNations seeking expansion, seeking the rectification of injustices\r\nspringing from former wars, or seeking outlets for trade, for population or\r\neven for their own peaceful contributions to the progress of civilization,\r\nfail to demonstrate that patience necessary to attain reasonable and\r\nlegitimate objectives by peaceful negotiation or by an appeal to the finer\r\ninstincts of world justice.\r\n\r\nThey have therefore impatiently reverted to the old belief in the law of\r\nthe sword, or to the fantastic conception that they, and they alone, are\r\nchosen to fulfill a mission and that all the others among the billion and a\r\nhalf of human beings in the world must and shall learn from and be subject\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nI recognize and you will recognize that these words which I have chosen\r\nwith deliberation will not prove popular in any Nation that chooses to fit\r\nthis shoe to its foot. Such sentiments, however, will find sympathy and\r\nunderstanding in those Nations where the people themselves are honestly\r\ndesirous of peace but must constantly align themselves on one side or the\r\nother in the kaleidoscopic jockeying for position which is characteristic\r\nof European and Asiatic relations today. For the peace-loving Nations, and\r\nthere are many of them, find that their very identity depends on their\r\nmoving and moving again on the chess board of international politics.\r\n\r\nI suggested in the spring of 1933 that 85 or 90 percent of all the people\r\nin the world were content with the territorial limits of their respective\r\nNations and were willing further to reduce their armed forces if every\r\nother Nation in the world would agree to do likewise.\r\n\r\nThat is equally true today, and it is even more true today that world peace\r\nand world good-will are blocked by only 10 or 15 percent of the world's\r\npopulation. That is why efforts to reduce armies have thus far not only\r\nfailed, but have been met by vastly increased armaments on land and in the\r\nair. That is why even efforts to continue the existing limits on naval\r\narmaments into the years to come show such little current success.\r\n\r\nBut the policy of the United States has been clear and consistent. We have\r\nsought with earnestness in every possible way to limit world armaments and\r\nto attain the peaceful solution of disputes among all Nations.\r\n\r\nWe have sought by every legitimate means to exert our moral influence\r\nagainst repression, against intolerance, against autocracy and in favor of\r\nfreedom of expression, equality before the law, religious tolerance and\r\npopular rule.\r\n\r\nIn the field of commerce we have undertaken to encourage a more reasonable\r\ninterchange of the world's goods. In the field of international finance we\r\nhave, so far as we are concerned, put an end to dollar diplomacy, to money\r\ngrabbing, to speculation for the benefit of the powerful and the rich, at\r\nthe expense of the small and the poor.\r\n\r\nAs a consistent part of a clear policy, the United States is following a\r\ntwofold neutrality toward any and all Nations which engage in wars that are\r\nnot of immediate concern to the Americas. First, we decline to encourage\r\nthe prosecution of war by permitting belligerents to obtain arms,\r\nammunition or implements of war from the United States. Second, we seek to\r\ndiscourage the use by belligerent Nations of any and all American products\r\ncalculated to facilitate the prosecution of a war in quantities over and\r\nabove our normal exports of them in time of peace.\r\n\r\nI trust that these objectives thus clearly and unequivocally stated will be\r\ncarried forward by cooperation between this Congress and the President.\r\n\r\nI realize that I have emphasized to you the gravity of the situation which\r\nconfronts the people of the world. This emphasis is justified because of\r\nits importance to civilization and therefore to the United States. Peace is\r\njeopardized by the few and not by the many. Peace is threatened by those\r\nwho seek selfish power. The world has witnessed similar eras--as in the\r\ndays when petty kings and feudal barons were changing the map of Europe\r\nevery fortnight, or when great emperors and great kings were engaged in a\r\nmad scramble for colonial empire. We hope that we are not again at the\r\nthreshold of such an era. But if face it we must, then the United States\r\nand the rest of the Americas can play but one role: through a well-ordered\r\nneutrality to do naught to encourage the contest, through adequate defense\r\nto save ourselves from embroilment and attack, and through example and all\r\nlegitimate encouragement and assistance to persuade other Nations to return\r\nto the ways of peace and good-will.\r\n\r\nThe evidence before us clearly proves that autocracy in world affairs\r\nendangers peace and that such threats do not spring from those Nations\r\ndevoted to the democratic ideal. If this be true in world affairs, it\r\nshould have the greatest weight in the determination of domestic policies.\r\n\r\nWithin democratic Nations the chief concern of the people is to prevent the\r\ncontinuance or the rise of autocratic institutions that beget slavery at\r\nhome and aggression abroad. Within our borders, as in the world at large,\r\npopular opinion is at war with a power-seeking minority.\r\n\r\nThat is no new thing. It was fought out in the Constitutional Convention of\r\n1787. From time to time since then, the battle has been continued, under\r\nThomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson.\r\n\r\nIn these latter years we have witnessed the domination of government by\r\nfinancial and industrial groups, numerically small but politically dominant\r\nin the twelve years that succeeded the World War. The present group of\r\nwhich I speak is indeed numerically small and, while it exercises a large\r\ninfluence and has much to say in the world of business, it does not, I am\r\nconfident, speak the true sentiments of the less articulate but more\r\nimportant elements that constitute real American business.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1933, I appealed to the Congress of the United States and to the\r\npeople of the United States in a new effort to restore power to those to\r\nwhom it rightfully belonged. The response to that appeal resulted in the\r\nwriting of a new chapter in the history of popular government. You, the\r\nmembers of the Legislative branch, and I, the Executive, contended for and\r\nestablished a new relationship between Government and people.\r\n\r\nWhat were the terms of that new relationship? They were an appeal from the\r\nclamor of many private and selfish interests, yes, an appeal from the\r\nclamor of partisan interest, to the ideal of the public interest.\r\nGovernment became the representative and the trustee of the public\r\ninterest. Our aim was to build upon essentially democratic institutions,\r\nseeking all the while the adjustment of burdens, the help of the needy, the\r\nprotection of the weak, the liberation of the exploited and the genuine\r\nprotection of the people's property.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that to create such an economic constitutional\r\norder, more than a single legislative enactment was called for. We, you in\r\nthe Congress and I as the Executive, had to build upon a broad base. Now,\r\nafter thirty-four months of work, we contemplate a fairly rounded whole. We\r\nhave returned the control of the Federal Government to the City of\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, in so doing, we have invited battle. We have earned the hatred\r\nof entrenched greed. The very nature of the problem that we faced made it\r\nnecessary to drive some people from power and strictly to regulate others.\r\nI made that plain when I took the oath of office in March, 1933. I spoke of\r\nthe practices of the unscrupulous money-changers who stood indicted in the\r\ncourt of public opinion. I spoke of the rulers of the exchanges of\r\nmankind's goods, who failed through their own stubbornness and their own\r\nincompetence. I said that they had admitted their failure and had\r\nabdicated.\r\n\r\nAbdicated? Yes, in 1933, but now with the passing of danger they forget\r\ntheir damaging admissions and withdraw their abdication.\r\n\r\nThey seek the restoration of their selfish power. They offer to lead us\r\nback round the same old corner into the same old dreary street.\r\n\r\nYes, there are still determined groups that are intent upon that very\r\nthing. Rigorously held up to popular examination, their true character\r\npresents itself. They steal the livery of great national constitutional\r\nideals to serve discredited special interests. As guardians and trustees\r\nfor great groups of individual stockholders they wrongfully seek to carry\r\nthe property and the interests entrusted to them into the arena of partisan\r\npolitics. They seek--this minority in business and industry--to control and\r\noften do control and use for their own purposes legitimate and highly\r\nhonored business associations; they engage in vast propaganda to spread\r\nfear and discord among the people--they would \"gang up\" against the people's\r\nliberties.\r\n\r\nThe principle that they would instill into government if they succeed in\r\nseizing power is well shown by the principles which many of them have\r\ninstilled into their own affairs: autocracy toward labor, toward\r\nstockholders, toward consumers, toward public sentiment. Autocrats in\r\nsmaller things, they seek autocracy in bigger things. \"By their fruits ye\r\nshall know them.\"\r\n\r\nIf these gentlemen believe, as they say they believe, that the measures\r\nadopted by this Congress and its predecessor, and carried out by this\r\nAdministration, have hindered rather than promoted recovery, let them be\r\nconsistent. Let them propose to this Congress the complete repeal of these\r\nmeasures. The way is open to such a proposal.\r\n\r\nLet action be positive and not negative. The way is open in the Congress of\r\nthe United States for an expression of opinion by yeas and nays. Shall we\r\nsay that values are restored and that the Congress will, therefore, repeal\r\nthe laws under which we have been bringing them back? Shall we say that\r\nbecause national income has grown with rising prosperity, we shall repeal\r\nexisting taxes and thereby put off the day of approaching a balanced budget\r\nand of starting to reduce the national debt? Shall we abandon the\r\nreasonable support and regulation of banking? Shall we restore the dollar\r\nto its former gold content?\r\n\r\nShall we say to the farmer, \"The prices for your products are in part\r\nrestored. Now go and hoe your own row?\"\r\n\r\nShall we say to the home owners, \"We have reduced your rates of interest.\r\nWe have no further concern with how you keep your home or what you pay for\r\nyour money. That is your affair?\"\r\n\r\nShall we say to the several millions of unemployed citizens who face the\r\nvery problem of existence, of getting enough to eat, \"We will withdraw from\r\ngiving you work. We will turn you back to the charity of your communities\r\nand those men of selfish power who tell you that perhaps they will employ\r\nyou if the Government leaves them strictly alone?\"\r\n\r\nShall we say to the needy unemployed, \"Your problem is a local one except\r\nthat perhaps the Federal Government, as an act of mere generosity, will be\r\nwilling to pay to your city or to your county a few grudging dollars to\r\nhelp maintain your soup kitchens?\"\r\n\r\nShall we say to the children who have worked all day in the factories,\r\n\"Child labor is a local issue and so are your starvation wages; something\r\nto be solved or left unsolved by the jurisdiction of forty-eight States?\"\r\n\r\nShall we say to the laborer, \"Your right to organize, your relations with\r\nyour employer have nothing to do with the public interest; if your employer\r\nwill not even meet with you to discuss your problems and his, that is none\r\nof our affair?\"\r\n\r\nShall we say to the unemployed and the aged, \"Social security lies not\r\nwithin the province of the Federal Government; you must seek relief\r\nelsewhere?\"\r\n\r\nShall we say to the men and women who live in conditions of squalor in\r\ncountry and in city, \"The health and the happiness of you and your children\r\nare no concern of ours?\"\r\n\r\nShall we expose our population once more by the repeal of laws which\r\nprotect them against the loss of their honest investments and against the\r\nmanipulations of dishonest speculators? Shall we abandon the splendid\r\nefforts of the Federal Government to raise the health standards of the\r\nNation and to give youth a decent opportunity through such means as the\r\nCivilian Conservation Corps?\r\n\r\nMembers of the Congress, let these challenges be met. If this is what these\r\ngentlemen want, let them say so to the Congress of the United States. Let\r\nthem no longer hide their dissent in a cowardly cloak of generality. Let\r\nthem define the issue. We have been specific in our affirmative action. Let\r\nthem be specific in their negative attack.\r\n\r\nBut the challenge faced by this Congress is more menacing than merely a\r\nreturn to the past--bad as that would be. Our resplendent economic autocracy\r\ndoes not want to return to that individualism of which they prate, even\r\nthough the advantages under that system went to the ruthless and the\r\nstrong. They realize that in thirty-four months we have built up new\r\ninstruments of public power. In the hands of a people's Government this\r\npower is wholesome and proper. But in the hands of political puppets of an\r\neconomic autocracy such power would provide shackles for the liberties of\r\nthe people. Give them their way and they will take the course of every\r\nautocracy of the past--power for themselves, enslavement for the public.\r\n\r\nTheir weapon is the weapon of fear. I have said, \"The only thing we have to\r\nfear is fear itself.\" That is as true today as it was in 1933. But such\r\nfear as they instill today is not a natural fear, a normal fear; it is a\r\nsynthetic, manufactured, poisonous fear that is being spread subtly,\r\nexpensively and cleverly by the same people who cried in those other days,\r\n\"Save us, save us, lest we perish.\"\r\n\r\nI am confident that the Congress of the United States well understands the\r\nfacts and is ready to wage unceasing warfare against those who seek a\r\ncontinuation of that spirit of fear. The carrying out of the laws of the\r\nland as enacted by the Congress requires protection until final\r\nadjudication by the highest tribunal of the land. The Congress has the\r\nright and can find the means to protect its own prerogatives.\r\n\r\nWe are justified in our present confidence. Restoration of national income,\r\nwhich shows continuing gains for the third successive year, supports the\r\nnormal and logical policies under which agriculture and industry are\r\nreturning to full activity. Under these policies we approach a balance of\r\nthe national budget. National income increases; tax receipts, based on that\r\nincome, increase without the levying of new taxes. That is why I am able to\r\nsay to this, the Second Session of the 74th Congress, that it is my belief\r\nbased on existing laws that no new taxes, over and above the present taxes,\r\nare either advisable or necessary.\r\n\r\nNational income increases; employment increases. Therefore, we can look\r\nforward to a reduction in the number of those citizens who are in need.\r\nTherefore, also, we can anticipate a reduction in our appropriations for\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nIn the light of our substantial material progress, in the light of the\r\nincreasing effectiveness of the restoration of popular rule, I recommend to\r\nthe Congress that we advance; that we do not retreat. I have confidence\r\nthat you will not fail the people of the Nation whose mandate you have\r\nalready so faithfully fulfilled.\r\n\r\nI repeat, with the same faith and the same determination, my words of March\r\n4, 1933: \"We face the arduous days that lie before us in the warm courage\r\nof national unity; with a clear consciousness of seeking old and precious\r\nmoral values; with a clean satisfaction that comes from the stern\r\nperformance of duty by old and young alike. We aim at the assurance of a\r\nrounded and permanent national life. We do not distrust the future of\r\nessential democracy.\"\r\n\r\nI cannot better end this message on the state of the Union than by\r\nrepeating the words of a wise philosopher at whose feet I sat many, many\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\n\"What great crises teach all men whom the example and counsel of the brave\r\ninspire is the lesson: Fear not, view all the tasks of life as sacred, have\r\nfaith in the triumph of the ideal, give daily all that you have to give, be\r\nloyal and rejoice whenever you find yourselves part of a great ideal\r\nenterprise. You, at this moment, have the honor to belong to a generation\r\nwhose lips are touched by fire. You live in a land that now enjoys the\r\nblessings of peace. But let nothing human be wholly alien to you. The human\r\nrace now passes through one of its great crises. New ideas, new issues--a\r\nnew call for men to carry on the work of righteousness, of charity, of\r\ncourage, of patience, and of loyalty. . . . However memory bring back this\r\nmoment to your minds, let it be able to say to you: That was a great\r\nmoment. It was the beginning of a new era. . . . This world in its crisis\r\ncalled for volunteers, for men of faith in life, of patience in service, of\r\ncharity and of insight. I responded to the call however I could. I\r\nvolunteered to give myself to my Master--the cause of humane and brave\r\nliving. I studied, I loved, I labored, unsparingly and hopefully, to be\r\nworthy of my generation.\"\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\r\nJanuary 6, 1937\r\n\r\nMr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Congress of the United States:\r\n\r\nFor the first time in our national history a President delivers his Annual\r\nMessage to a new Congress within a fortnight of the expiration of his term\r\nof office. While there is no change in the Presidency this year, change\r\nwill occur in future years. It is my belief that under this new\r\nconstitutional practice, the President should in every fourth year, in so\r\nfar as seems reasonable, review the existing state of our national affairs\r\nand outline broad future problems, leaving specific recommendations for\r\nfuture legislation to be made by the President about to be inaugurated.\r\n\r\nAt this time, however, circumstances of the moment compel me to ask your\r\nimmediate consideration of: First, measures extending the life of certain\r\nauthorizations and powers which, under present statutes, expire within a\r\nfew weeks; second, an addition to the existing Neutrality Act to cover\r\nspecific points raised by the unfortunate civil strife in Spain; and,\r\nthird, a deficiency appropriation bill for which I shall submit estimates\r\nthis week.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1933, the problems which faced our Nation and which only our\r\nnational Government had the resources to meet were more serious even than\r\nappeared on the surface.\r\n\r\nIt was not only that the visible mechanism of economic life had broken\r\ndown. More disturbing was the fact that long neglect of the needs of the\r\nunderprivileged had brought too many of our people to the verge of doubt as\r\nto the successful adaptation of our historic traditions to the complex\r\nmodern world. In that lay a challenge to our democratic form of Government\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nOurs was the task to prove that democracy could be made to function in the\r\nworld of today as effectively as in the simpler world of a hundred years\r\nago. Ours was the task to do more than to argue a theory. The times\r\nrequired the confident answer of performance to those whose instinctive\r\nfaith in humanity made them want to believe that in the long run democracy\r\nwould prove superior to more extreme forms of Government as a process of\r\ngetting action when action was wisdom, without the spiritual sacrifices\r\nwhich those other forms of Government exact.\r\n\r\nThat challenge we met. To meet it required unprecedented activities under\r\nFederal leadership to end abuses, to restore a large measure of material\r\nprosperity, to give new faith to millions of our citizens who had been\r\ntraditionally taught to expect that democracy would provide continuously\r\nwider opportunity and continuously greater security in a world where\r\nscience was continuously making material riches more available to man.\r\n\r\nIn the many methods of attack with which we met these problems, you and I,\r\nby mutual understanding and by determination to cooperate, helped to make\r\ndemocracy succeed by refusing to permit unnecessary disagreement to arise\r\nbetween two of our branches of Government. That spirit of cooperation was\r\nable to solve difficulties of extraordinary magnitude and ramification with\r\nfew important errors, and at a cost cheap when measured by the immediate\r\nnecessities and the eventual results.\r\n\r\nI look forward to a continuance of that cooperation in the next four years.\r\nI look forward also to a continuance of the basis of that cooperation--\r\nmutual respect for each other's proper sphere of functioning in a democracy\r\nwhich is working well, and a common-sense realization of the need for play\r\nin the joints of the machine.\r\n\r\nOn that basis, it is within the right of the Congress to determine which of\r\nthe many new activities shall be continued or abandoned, increased or\r\ncurtailed.\r\n\r\nOn that same basis, the President alone has the responsibility for their\r\nadministration. I find that this task of Executive management has reached\r\nthe point where our administrative machinery needs comprehensive\r\noverhauling. I shall, therefore, shortly address the Congress more fully in\r\nregard to modernizing and improving the Executive branch of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThat cooperation of the past four years between the Congress and the\r\nPresident has aimed at the fulfillment of a twofold policy: first, economic\r\nrecovery through many kinds of assistance to agriculture, industry and\r\nbanking; and, second, deliberate improvement in the personal security and\r\nopportunity of the great mass of our people.\r\n\r\nThe recovery we sought was not to be merely temporary. It was to be a\r\nrecovery protected from the causes of previous disasters. With that aim in\r\nview--to prevent a future similar crisis--you and I joined in a series of\r\nenactments--safe banking and sound currency, the guarantee of bank deposits,\r\nprotection for the investor in securities, the removal of the threat of\r\nagricultural surpluses, insistence on collective bargaining, the outlawing\r\nof sweat shops, child labor and unfair trade practices, and the beginnings\r\nof security for the aged and the worker.\r\n\r\nNor was the recovery we sought merely a purposeless whirring of machinery.\r\nIt is important, of course, that every man and woman in the country be able\r\nto find work, that every factory run, that business and farming as a whole\r\nearn profits. But Government in a democratic Nation does not exist solely,\r\nor even primarily, for that purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is not enough that the wheels turn. They must carry us in the direction\r\nof a greater satisfaction in life for the average man. The deeper purpose\r\nof democratic government is to assist as many of its citizens as possible,\r\nespecially those who need it most, to improve their conditions of life, to\r\nretain all personal liberty which does not adversely affect their\r\nneighbors, and to pursue the happiness which comes with security and an\r\nopportunity for recreation and culture.\r\n\r\nEven with our present recovery we are far from the goal of that deeper\r\npurpose. There are far-reaching problems still with us for which democracy\r\nmust find solutions if it is to consider itself successful.\r\n\r\nFor example, many millions of Americans still live in habitations which not\r\nonly fail to provide the physical benefits of modern civilization but breed\r\ndisease and impair the health of future generations. The menace exists not\r\nonly in the slum areas of the very large cities, but in many smaller cities\r\nas well. It exists on tens of thousands of farms, in varying degrees, in\r\nevery part of the country.\r\n\r\nAnother example is the prevalence of an un-American type of tenant farming.\r\nI do not suggest that every farm family has the capacity to earn a\r\nsatisfactory living on its own farm. But many thousands of tenant farmers,\r\nindeed most of them, with some financial assistance and with some advice\r\nand training, can be made self-supporting on land which can eventually\r\nbelong to them. The Nation would be wise to offer them that chance instead\r\nof permitting them to go along as they do now, year after year, with\r\nneither future security as tenants nor hope of ownership of their homes nor\r\nexpectation of bettering the lot of their children.\r\n\r\nAnother national problem is the intelligent development of our social\r\nsecurity system, the broadening of the services it renders, and practical\r\nimprovement in its operation. In many Nations where such laws are in\r\neffect, success in meeting the expectations of the community has come\r\nthrough frequent amendment of the original statute.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, the most far-reaching and the most inclusive problem of all\r\nis that of unemployment and the lack of economic balance of which\r\nunemployment is at once the result and the symptom. The immediate question\r\nof adequate relief for the needy unemployed who are capable of performing\r\nuseful work, I shall discuss with the Congress during the coming months.\r\nThe broader task of preventing unemployment is a matter of long-range\r\nevolutionary policy. To that we must continue to give our best thought and\r\neffort. We cannot assume that immediate industrial and commercial activity\r\nwhich mitigates present pressures justifies the national Government at this\r\ntime in placing the unemployment problem in a filing cabinet of finished\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nFluctuations in employment are tied to all other wasteful fluctuations in\r\nour mechanism of production and distribution. One of these wastes is\r\nspeculation. In securities or commodities, the larger the volume of\r\nspeculation, the wider become the upward and downward swings and the more\r\ncertain the result that in the long run there will be more losses than\r\ngains in the underlying wealth of the community.\r\n\r\nAnd, as is now well known to all of us, the same net loss to society comes\r\nfrom reckless overproduction and monopolistic underproduction of natural\r\nand manufactured commodities.\r\n\r\nOverproduction, underproduction and speculation are three evil sisters who\r\ndistill the troubles of unsound inflation and disastrous deflation. It is\r\nto the interest of the Nation to have Government help private enterprise to\r\ngain sound general price levels and to protect those levels from wide\r\nperilous fluctuations. We know now that if early in 1931 Government had\r\ntaken the steps which were taken two and three years later, the depression\r\nwould never have reached the depths of the beginning of 1933.\r\n\r\nSober second thought confirms most of us in the belief that the broad\r\nobjectives of the National Recovery Act were sound. We know now that its\r\ndifficulties arose from the fact that it tried to do too much. For example,\r\nit was unwise to expect the same agency to regulate the length of working\r\nhours, minimum wages, child labor and collective bargaining on the one hand\r\nand the complicated questions of unfair trade practices and business\r\ncontrols on the other.\r\n\r\nThe statute of N.R.A. has been outlawed. The problems have not. They are\r\nstill with us.\r\n\r\nThat decent conditions and adequate pay for labor, and just return for\r\nagriculture, can be secured through parallel and simultaneous action by\r\nforty-eight States is a proven impossibility. It is equally impossible to\r\nobtain curbs on monopoly, unfair trade practices and speculation by State\r\naction alone. There are those who, sincerely or insincerely, still cling to\r\nState action as a theoretical hope. But experience with actualities makes\r\nit clear that Federal laws supplementing State laws are needed to help\r\nsolve the problems which result from modern invention applied in an\r\nindustrialized Nation which conducts its business with scant regard to\r\nState lines.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year there has been a growing belief that there is little\r\nfault to be found with the Constitution of the United States as it stands\r\ntoday. The vital need is not an alteration of our fundamental law, but an\r\nincreasingly enlightened view with reference to it. Difficulties have grown\r\nout of its interpretation; but rightly considered, it can be used as an\r\ninstrument of progress, and not as a device for prevention of action.\r\n\r\nIt is worth our while to read and reread the preamble of the Constitution,\r\nand Article I thereof which confers the legislative powers upon the\r\nCongress of the United States. It is also worth our while to read again the\r\ndebates in the Constitutional Convention of one hundred and fifty years\r\nago. From such reading, I obtain the very definite thought that the members\r\nof that Convention were fully aware that civilization would raise problems\r\nfor the proposed new Federal Government, which they themselves could not\r\neven surmise; and that it was their definite intent and expectation that a\r\nliberal interpretation in the years to come would give to the Congress the\r\nsame relative powers over new national problems as they themselves gave to\r\nthe Congress over the national problems of their day.\r\n\r\nIn presenting to the Convention the first basic draft of the Constitution,\r\nEdmund Randolph explained that it was the purpose \"to insert essential\r\nprinciples only, lest the operation of government should be clogged by\r\nrendering those provisions permanent and unalterable which ought to be\r\naccommodated to times and events.\"\r\n\r\nWith a better understanding of our purposes, and a more intelligent\r\nrecognition of our needs as a Nation, it is not to be assumed that there\r\nwill be prolonged failure to bring legislative and judicial action into\r\ncloser harmony. Means must be found to adapt our legal forms and our\r\njudicial interpretation to the actual present national needs of the largest\r\nprogressive democracy in the modern world.\r\n\r\nThat thought leads to a consideration of world problems. To go no further\r\nback than the beginning of this century, men and women everywhere were\r\nseeking conditions of life very different from those which were customary\r\nbefore modern invention and modern industry and modern communications had\r\ncome into being. The World war, for all of its tragedy, encouraged these\r\ndemands, and stimulated action to fulfill these new desires.\r\n\r\nMany national Governments seemed unable adequately to respond; and, often\r\nwith the improvident assent of the masses of the people themselves, new\r\nforms of government were set up with oligarchy taking the place of\r\ndemocracy. In oligarchies, militarism has leapt forward, while in those\r\nNations which have retained democracy, militarism has waned.\r\n\r\nI have recently visited three of our sister Republics in South America. The\r\nvery cordial receptions with which I was greeted were in tribute to\r\ndemocracy. To me the outstanding observation of that visit was that the\r\nmasses of the peoples of all the Americas are convinced that the democratic\r\nform of government can be made to succeed and do not wish to substitute for\r\nit any other form of government. They believe that democracies are best\r\nable to cope with the changing problems of modern civilization within\r\nthemselves, and that democracies are best able to maintain peace among\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe Inter-American Conference, operating on these fundamental principles of\r\ndemocracy, did much to assure peace in this Hemisphere. Existing peace\r\nmachinery was improved. New instruments to maintain peace and eliminate\r\ncauses of war were adopted. Wider protection of the interests of the\r\nAmerican Republics in the event of war outside the Western Hemisphere was\r\nprovided. Respect for, and observance of, international treaties and\r\ninternational law were strengthened. Principles of liberal trade policies,\r\nas effective aids to the maintenance of peace, were reaffirmed. The\r\nintellectual and cultural relationships among American Republics were\r\nbroadened as a part of the general peace program.\r\n\r\nIn a world unhappily thinking in terms of war, the representatives of\r\ntwenty-one Nations sat around a table, in an atmosphere of complete\r\nconfidence and understanding, sincerely discussing measures for maintaining\r\npeace. Here was a great and a permanent achievement directly affecting the\r\nlives and security of the two hundred and fifty million human beings who\r\ndwell in this Western Hemisphere. Here was an example which must have a\r\nwholesome effect upon the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nIn a very real sense, the Conference in Buenos Aires sent forth a message\r\non behalf of all the democracies of the world to those Nations which live\r\notherwise. Because such other Governments are perhaps more spectacular, it\r\nwas high time for democracy to assert itself.\r\n\r\nBecause all of us believe that our democratic form of government can cope\r\nadequately with modern problems as they arise, it is patriotic as well as\r\nlogical for us to prove that we can meet new national needs with new laws\r\nconsistent with an historic constitutional framework clearly intended to\r\nreceive liberal and not narrow interpretation.\r\n\r\nThe United States of America, within itself, must continue the task of\r\nmaking democracy succeed.\r\n\r\nIn that task the Legislative branch of our Government will, I am confident,\r\ncontinue to meet the demands of democracy whether they relate to the\r\ncurbing of abuses, the extension of help to those who need help, or the\r\nbetter balancing of our interdependent economies.\r\n\r\nSo, too, the Executive branch of the Government must move forward in this\r\ntask, and, at the same time, provide better management for administrative\r\naction of all kinds.\r\n\r\nThe Judicial branch also is asked by the people to do its part in making\r\ndemocracy successful. We do not ask the Courts to call non-existent powers\r\ninto being, but we have a right to expect that conceded powers or those\r\nlegitimately implied shall be made effective instruments for the common\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nThe process of our democracy must not be imperiled by the denial of\r\nessential powers of free government.\r\n\r\nYour task and mine is not ending with the end of the depression. The people\r\nof the United States have made it clear that they expect us to continue our\r\nactive efforts in behalf of their peaceful advancement.\r\n\r\nIn that spirit of endeavor and service I greet the 75th Congress at the\r\nbeginning of this auspicious New Year.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\r\nJanuary 3, 1938\r\n\r\nMr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Senate and of the House of\r\nRepresentatives:\r\n\r\nIn addressing the Congress on the state of the Union present facts and\r\nfuture hazards demand that I speak clearly and earnestly of the causes\r\nwhich underlie events of profound concern to all.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the determination of this Nation for peace, it has become clear\r\nthat acts and policies of nations in other parts of the world have\r\nfar-reaching effects not only upon their immediate neighbors but also on\r\nus.\r\n\r\nI am thankful that I can tell you that our Nation is at peace. It has been\r\nkept at peace despite provocations which in other days, because of their\r\nseriousness, could well have engendered war. The people of the United\r\nStates and the Government of the United States have shown capacity for\r\nrestraint and a civilized approach to the purposes of peace, while at the\r\nsame time we maintain the integrity inherent in the sovereignty of\r\n130,000,000 people, lest we weaken or destroy our influence for peace and\r\njeopardize the sovereignty itself.\r\n\r\nIt is our traditional policy to live at peace with other nations. More than\r\nthat, we have been among the leaders in advocating the use of pacific\r\nmethods of discussion and conciliation in international differences. We\r\nhave striven for the reduction of military forces.\r\n\r\nBut in a world of high tension and disorder, in a world where stable\r\ncivilization is actually threatened, it becomes the responsibility of each\r\nnation which strives for peace at home and peace with and among others to\r\nbe strong enough to assure the observance of those fundamentals of peaceful\r\nsolution of conflicts which are the only ultimate basis for orderly\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nResolute in our determination to respect the rights of others, and to\r\ncommand respect for the rights of ourselves, we must keep ourselves\r\nadequately strong in self-defense.\r\n\r\nThere is a trend in the world away from the observance both of the letter\r\nand the spirit of treaties. We propose to observe, as we have in the past,\r\nour own treaty obligations to the limit; but we cannot be certain of\r\nreciprocity on the part of others.\r\n\r\nDisregard for treaty obligations seems to have followed the surface trend\r\naway from the democratic representative form of government. It would seem,\r\ntherefore, that world peace through international agreements is most safe\r\nin the hands of democratic representative governments--or, in other words,\r\npeace is most greatly jeopardized in and by those nations where democracy\r\nhas been discarded or has never developed.\r\n\r\nI have used the words \"surface trend,\" for I still believe that civilized\r\nman increasingly insists and in the long run will insist on genuine\r\nparticipation in his own government. Our people believe that over the years\r\ndemocracies of the world will survive, and that democracy will be restored\r\nor established in those nations which today know it not. In that faith lies\r\nthe future peace of mankind.\r\n\r\nAt home, conditions call for my equal candor. Events of recent months are\r\nnew proof that we cannot conduct a national government after the practice\r\nof 1787, or 1837 or 1887, for the obvious reason that human needs and human\r\ndesires are infinitely greater, infinitely more difficult to meet than in\r\nany previous period in the life of our Republic. Hitherto it has been an\r\nacknowledged duty of government to meet these desires and needs: nothing\r\nhas occurred of late to absolve the Congress, the Courts or the President\r\nfrom that task. It faces us as squarely, as insistently, as in March,\r\n1933.\r\n\r\nMuch of trouble in our own lifetime has sprung from a long period of\r\ninaction--from ignoring what fundamentally was happening to us, and from a\r\ntime-serving unwillingness to face facts as they forced themselves upon\r\nus.\r\n\r\nOur national life rests on two nearly equal producing forces, agriculture\r\nand industry, each employing about one-third of our citizens. The other\r\nthird transports and distributes the products of the first two, or performs\r\nspecial services for the whole.\r\n\r\nThe first great force, agriculture--and with it the production of timber,\r\nminerals and other natural resources--went forward feverishly and\r\nthoughtlessly until nature rebelled and we saw deserts encroach, floods\r\ndestroy, trees disappear and soil exhausted.\r\n\r\nAt the same time we have been discovering that vast numbers of our farming\r\npopulation live in a poverty more abject than that of many of the farmers\r\nof Europe whom we are wont to call peasants; that the prices of our\r\nproducts of agriculture are too often dependent on speculation by\r\nnon-farming groups; and that foreign nations, eager to become\r\nself-sustaining or ready to put virgin land under the plough are no longer\r\nbuying our surpluses of cotton and wheat and lard and tobacco and fruit as\r\nthey had before.\r\n\r\nSince 1933 we have knowingly faced a choice of three remedies. First, to\r\ncut our cost of farm production below that of other nations--an obvious\r\nimpossibility in many crops today unless we revert to human slavery or its\r\nequivalent.\r\n\r\nSecond, to make the government the guarantor of farm prices and the\r\nunderwriter of excess farm production without limit--a course which would\r\nbankrupt the strongest government in the world in a decade.\r\n\r\nThird, to place the primary responsibility directly on the farmers\r\nthemselves, under the principle of majority rule, so that they may decide,\r\nwith full knowledge of the facts of surpluses, scarcities, world markets\r\nand domestic needs, what the planting of each crop should be in order to\r\nmaintain a reasonably adequate supply which will assure a minimum adequate\r\nprice under the normal processes of the law of supply and demand.\r\n\r\nThat means adequacy of supply but not glut. It means adequate reserves\r\nagainst the day of drought. It is shameless misrepresentation to call this\r\na policy of scarcity. It is in truth insurance before the fact, instead of\r\ngovernment subsidy after the fact.\r\n\r\nAny such plan for the control of excessive surpluses and the speculation\r\nthey bring has two enemies. There are those well meaning theorists who harp\r\non the inherent right of every free born American to do with his land what\r\nhe wants--to cultivate it well--or badly; to conserve his timber by cutting\r\nonly the annual increment thereof--or to strip it clean, let fire burn the\r\nslash, and erosion complete the ruin; to raise only one crop--and if that\r\ncrop fails, to look for food and support from his neighbors or his\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThat, I assert is not an inherent right of citizenship. For if a man farms\r\nhis land to the waste of the soil or the trees, he destroys not only his\r\nown assets but the Nation's assets as well. Or if by his methods he makes\r\nhimself, year after year, a financial hazard of the community and the\r\ngovernment, he becomes not only a social problem but an economic menace.\r\nThe day has gone by when it could be claimed that government has no\r\ninterest in such ill-considered practices and no right through\r\nrepresentative methods to stop them.\r\n\r\nThe other group of enemies is perhaps less well-meaning. It includes those\r\nwho for partisan purposes oppose each and every practical effort to help\r\nthe situation, and also those who make money from undue fluctuations in\r\ncrop prices.\r\n\r\nI gladly note that measures which seek to initiate a government program for\r\na balanced agriculture are now in conference between the two Houses of the\r\nCongress. In their final consideration, I hope for a sound consistent\r\nmeasure which will keep the cost of its administration within the figure of\r\ncurrent government expenditures in aid of agriculture. The farmers of this\r\nNation know that a balanced output can be put into effect without excessive\r\ncost and with the cooperation of the great majority of them.\r\n\r\nIf this balance can be created by an all-weather farm program, our farm\r\npopulation will soon be assured of relatively constant purchasing power.\r\nFrom this will flow two other practical results: the consuming public will\r\nbe protected against excessive food and textile prices, and the industries\r\nof the Nation and their workers will find a steadier demand for wares sold\r\nto the agricultural third of our people.\r\n\r\nTo raise the purchasing power of the farmer is, however, not enough. It\r\nwill not stay raised if we do not also raise the purchasing power of that\r\nthird of the Nation which receives its income from industrial employment.\r\nMillions of industrial workers receive pay so low that they have little\r\nbuying power. Aside from the undoubted fact that they thereby suffer great\r\nhuman hardship, they are unable to buy adequate food and shelter, to\r\nmaintain health or to buy their share of manufactured goods.\r\n\r\nWe have not only seen minimum wage and maximum hour provisions prove their\r\nworth economically and socially under government auspices in 1933, 1934 and\r\n1935, but the people of this country, by an overwhelming vote, are in favor\r\nof having the Congress--this Congress--put a floor below which industrial\r\nwages shall not fall, and a ceiling beyond which the hours of industrial\r\nlabor shall not rise.\r\n\r\nHere again let us analyze the opposition. A part of it is sincere in\r\nbelieving that an effort thus to raise the purchasing power of lowest paid\r\nindustrial workers is not the business of the Federal Government. Others\r\ngive \"lip service\" to a general objective, but do not like any specific\r\nmeasure that is proposed. In both cases it is worth our while to wonder\r\nwhether some of these opponents are not at heart opposed to any program for\r\nraising the wages of the underpaid or reducing the hours of the\r\noverworked.\r\n\r\nAnother group opposes legislation of this type on the ground that cheap\r\nlabor will help their locality to acquire industries and outside capital,\r\nor to retain industries which today are surviving only because of existing\r\nlow wages and long hours. It has been my thought that, especially during\r\nthese past five years, this Nation has grown away from local or sectional\r\nselfishness and toward national patriotism and unity. I am disappointed by\r\nsome recent actions and by some recent utterances which sound like the\r\nphilosophy of half a century ago.\r\n\r\nThere are many communities in the United States where the average family\r\nincome is pitifully low. It is in those communities that we find the\r\npoorest educational facilities and the worst conditions of health. Why? It\r\nis not because they are satisfied to live as they do. It is because those\r\ncommunities have the lowest per capita wealth and income; therefore, the\r\nlowest ability to pay taxes; and, therefore, inadequate functioning of\r\nlocal government.\r\n\r\nSuch communities exist in the East, in the Middle West, in the Far West,\r\nand in the South. Those who represent such areas in every part of the\r\ncountry do their constituents ill service by blocking efforts to raise\r\ntheir incomes, their property values and, therefore, their whole scale of\r\nliving. In the long run, the profits from Child labor, low pay and overwork\r\nenure not to the locality or region where they exist but to the absentee\r\nowners who have sent their capital into these exploited communities to\r\ngather larger profits for themselves. Indeed, new enterprises and new\r\nindustries which bring permanent wealth will come more readily to those\r\ncommunities which insist on good pay and reasonable hours, for the simple\r\nreason that there they will find a greater industrial efficiency and\r\nhappier workers.\r\n\r\nNo reasonable person seeks a complete uniformity in wages in every part of\r\nthe United States; nor does any reasonable person seek an immediate and\r\ndrastic change from the lowest pay to the highest pay. We are seeking, of\r\ncourse, only legislation to end starvation wages and intolerable hours;\r\nmore desirable wages are and should continue to be the product of\r\ncollective bargaining.\r\n\r\nMany of those who represent great cities have shown their understanding of\r\nthe necessity of helping the agricultural third of the Nation. I hope that\r\nthose who represent constituencies primarily agricultural will not\r\nunderestimate the importance of extending like aid to the industrial\r\nthird.\r\n\r\nWage and hour legislation, therefore, is a problem which is definitely\r\nbefore this Congress for action. It is an essential part of economic\r\nrecovery. It has the support of an overwhelming majority of our people in\r\nevery walk of life. They have expressed themselves through the ballot box.\r\n\r\nAgain I revert to the increase of national purchasing power as an\r\nunderlying necessity of the day. If you increase that purchasing power for\r\nthe farmers and for the industrial workers, especially for those in both\r\ngroups who have least of it today, you will increase the purchasing power\r\nof the final third of our population--those who transport and distribute the\r\nproducts of farm and factory, and those of the professions who serve all\r\ngroups. I have tried to make clear to you, and through you to the people of\r\nthe United States, that this is an urgency which must be met by complete\r\nand not by partial action.\r\n\r\nIf it is met, if the purchasing power of the Nation as a whole--in other\r\nwords, the total of the Nation's income--can be still further increased,\r\nother happy results will flow from such increase.\r\n\r\nWe have raised the Nation's income from thirty-eight billion dollars in the\r\nyear 1932 to about sixty-eight billion dollars in the year 1937. Our goal,\r\nour objective is to raise it to ninety or one hundred billion dollars.\r\n\r\nWe have heard much about a balanced budget, and it is interesting to note\r\nthat many of those who have pleaded for a balanced budget as the sole need\r\nnow come to me to plead for additional government expenditures at the\r\nexpense of unbalancing the budget. As the Congress is fully aware, the\r\nannual deficit, large for several years, has been declining the last fiscal\r\nyear and this. The proposed budget for 1939, which I shall shortly send to\r\nthe Congress, will exhibit a further decrease in the deficit, though not a\r\nbalance between income and outgo.\r\n\r\nTo many who have pleaded with me for an immediate balancing of the budget,\r\nby a sharp curtailment or even elimination of government functions, I have\r\nasked the question: \"What present expenditures would you reduce or\r\neliminate?\" And the invariable answer has been \"that is not my business--I\r\nknow nothing of the details, but I am sure that it could be done.\" That is\r\nnot what you or I would call helpful citizenship.\r\n\r\nOn only one point do most of them have a suggestion. They think that relief\r\nfor the unemployed by the giving of work is wasteful, and when I pin them\r\ndown I discover that at heart they are actually in favor of substituting a\r\ndole in place of useful work. To that neither I nor, I am confident, the\r\nSenators and Representatives in the Congress will ever consent.\r\n\r\nI am as anxious as any banker or industrialist or business man or investor\r\nor economist that the budget of the United States Government be brought\r\ninto balance as quickly as possible. But I lay down certain conditions\r\nwhich seem reasonable and which I believe all should accept.\r\n\r\nThe first condition is that we continue the policy of not permitting any\r\nneedy American who can and is willing to work to starve because the Federal\r\nGovernment does not provide the work.\r\n\r\nThe second is that the Congress and the Executive join hands in eliminating\r\nor curtailing any Federal activity which can be eliminated or curtailed or\r\neven postponed without harming necessary government functions or the safety\r\nof the Nation from a national point of view.\r\n\r\nThe third is to raise the purchasing power of the Nation to the point that\r\nthe taxes on this purchasing power--or, in other words, on the Nation's\r\nincome--will be sufficient to meet the necessary expenditures of the\r\nnational government.\r\n\r\nI have hitherto stated that, in my judgment, the expenditures of the\r\nnational government cannot be cut much below seven billion dollars a year\r\nwithout destroying essential functions or letting people starve. That sum\r\ncan be raised and will be cheerfully provided by the American people, if we\r\ncan increase the Nation's income to a point well beyond the present level.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that as the Nation's income goes up the Federal\r\nexpenditures should rise in proportion. On the contrary, the Congress and\r\nthe Executive should use every effort to hold the normal Federal\r\nexpenditures to approximately the present level, thus making it possible,\r\nwith an increase in the Nation's income and the resulting increase in tax\r\nreceipts, not only to balance future budgets but to reduce the debt.\r\n\r\nIn line with this policy fall my former recommendations for the\r\nreorganization and improvement of the administrative structure of the\r\ngovernment, both for immediate Executive needs and for the planning of\r\nfuture national needs. I renew those recommendations.\r\n\r\nIn relation to tax changes, three things should be kept in mind. First, the\r\ntotal sum to be derived by the Federal Treasury must not be decreased as a\r\nresult of any changes in schedules. Second, abuses by individuals or\r\ncorporations designed to escape tax-paying by using various methods of\r\ndoing business, corporate and otherwise--abuses which we have sought, with\r\ngreat success, to end--must not be restored. Third, we should rightly change\r\ncertain provisions where they are proven to work definite hardship,\r\nespecially on the small business men of the Nation. But, speculative income\r\nshould not be favored over earned income.\r\n\r\nIt is human nature to argue that this or that tax is responsible for every\r\nill. It is human nature on the part of those who pay graduated taxes to\r\nattack all taxes based on the principle of ability to pay. These are the\r\nsame complainants who for a generation blocked the imposition of a\r\ngraduated income tax. They are the same complainants who would impose the\r\ntype of flat sales tax which places the burden of government more on those\r\nleast able to pay and less on those most able to pay.\r\n\r\nOur conclusion must be that while proven hardships should be corrected,\r\nthey should not be corrected in such a way as to restore abuses already\r\nterminated or to shift a greater burden to the less fortunate.\r\n\r\nThis subject leads naturally into the wider field of the public attitude\r\ntoward business. The objective of increasing the purchasing power of the\r\nfarming third, the industrial third and the service third of our population\r\npresupposes the cooperation of what we call capital and labor.\r\n\r\nCapital is essential; reasonable earnings on capital are essential; but\r\nmisuse of the powers of capital or selfish suspension of the employment of\r\ncapital must be ended, or the capitalistic system will destroy itself\r\nthrough its own abuses.\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming majority of business men and bankers intend to be good\r\ncitizens. Only a small minority have displayed poor citizenship by engaging\r\nin practices which are dishonest or definitely harmful to society. This\r\nstatement is straightforward and true. No person in any responsible place\r\nin the Government of the United States today has ever taken any position\r\ncontrary to it.\r\n\r\nBut, unfortunately for the country, when attention is called to, or attack\r\nis made on specific misuses of capital, there has been a deliberate purpose\r\non the part of the condemned minority to distort the criticism into an\r\nattack on all capital. That is wilful deception but it does not long\r\ndeceive.\r\n\r\nIf attention is called to, or attack made on, certain wrongful business\r\npractices, there are those who are eager to call it \"an attack on all\r\nbusiness.\" That, too, is wilful deception that will not long deceive. Let\r\nus consider certain facts:\r\n\r\nThere are practices today which most people believe should be ended. They\r\ninclude tax avoidance through corporate and other methods, which I have\r\npreviously mentioned; excessive capitalization, investment write-ups and\r\nsecurity manipulations; price rigging and collusive bidding in defiance of\r\nthe spirit of the antitrust laws by methods which baffle prosecution under\r\nthe present statutes. They include high-pressure salesmanship which creates\r\ncycles of overproduction within given industries and consequent recessions\r\nin production until such time as the surplus is consumed; the use of patent\r\nlaws to enable larger corporations to maintain high prices and withhold\r\nfrom the public the advantages of the progress of science; unfair\r\ncompetition which drives the smaller producer out of business locally,\r\nregionally or even on a national scale; intimidation of local or state\r\ngovernment to prevent the enactment of laws for the protection of labor by\r\nthreatening to move elsewhere; the shifting of actual production from one\r\nlocality or region to another in pursuit of the cheapest wage scale.\r\n\r\nThe enumeration of these abuses does not mean that business as a whole is\r\nguilty of them. Again, it is deception that will not long deceive to tell\r\nthe country that an attack on these abuses is an attack on business.\r\n\r\nAnother group of problems affecting business, which cannot be termed\r\nspecific abuses, gives us food for grave thought about the future.\r\nGenerically such problems arise out of the concentration of economic\r\ncontrol to the detriment of the body politic--control of other people's\r\nmoney, other people's labor, other people's lives.\r\n\r\nIn many instances such concentrations cannot be justified on the ground of\r\noperating efficiency, but have been created for the sake of securities\r\nprofits, financial control, the suppression of competition and the ambition\r\nfor power over others. In some lines of industry a very small numerical\r\ngroup is in such a position of influence that its actions are of necessity\r\nfollowed by the other units operating in the same field.\r\n\r\nThat such influences operate to control banking and finance is equally\r\ntrue, in spite of the many efforts, through Federal legislation, to take\r\nsuch control out of the hands of a small group. We have but to talk with\r\nhundreds of small bankers throughout the United States to realize that\r\nirrespective of local conditions, they are compelled in practice to accept\r\nthe policies laid down by a small number of the larger banks in the Nation.\r\nThe work undertaken by Andrew Jackson and Woodrow Wilson is not finished\r\nyet.\r\n\r\nThe ownership of vast properties or the organization of thousands of\r\nworkers creates a heavy obligation of public service. The power should not\r\nbe sought or sanctioned unless the responsibility is accepted as well. The\r\nman who seeks freedom from such responsibility in the name of individual\r\nliberty is either fooling himself or trying to cheat his fellow men. He\r\nwants to eat the fruits of orderly society without paying for them.\r\n\r\nAs a Nation we have rejected any radical revolutionary program. For a\r\npermanent correction of grave weaknesses in our economic system we have\r\nrelied on new applications of old democratic processes. It is not necessary\r\nto recount what has been accomplished in preserving the homes and\r\nlivelihood of millions of workers on farms and in cities, in reconstructing\r\na sound banking and credit system, in reviving trade and industry, in\r\nreestablishing security of life and property. All we need today is to look\r\nupon the fundamental, sound economic conditions to know that this business\r\nrecession causes more perplexity than fear on the part of most people and\r\nto contrast our prevailing mental attitude with the terror and despair of\r\nfive years ago.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we have a new moral climate in America. That means that we ask\r\nbusiness and finance to recognize that fact, to cure such inequalities as\r\nthey can cure without legislation but to join their government in the\r\nenactment of legislation where the ending of abuses and the steady\r\nfunctioning of our economic system calls for government assistance. The\r\nNation has no obligation to make America safe either for incompetent\r\nbusiness men or for business men who fail to note the trend of the times\r\nand continue the use of machinery of economics and practices of finance as\r\noutworn as the cotton spindle of 1870.\r\n\r\nGovernment can be expected to cooperate in every way with the business of\r\nthe Nation provided the component parts of business abandon practices which\r\ndo not belong to this day and age, and adopt price and production policies\r\nappropriate to the times.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the relationship of government to certain processes of\r\nbusiness, to which I have referred, it seems clear to me that existing laws\r\nundoubtedly require reconstruction. I expect, therefore, to address the\r\nCongress in a special message on this subject, and I hope to have the help\r\nof business in the efforts of government to help business.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of labor as another essential in the three great groups of\r\nthe population in raising the Nation's income. Definite strides in\r\ncollective bargaining have been made and the right of labor to organize has\r\nbeen nationally accepted. Nevertheless in the evolution of the process\r\ndifficult situations have arisen in localities and among groups.\r\nUnfortunate divisions relating to jurisdiction among the workers themselves\r\nhave retarded production within given industries and have, therefore,\r\naffected related industries. The construction of homes and other buildings\r\nhas been hindered in some localities not only by unnecessarily high prices\r\nfor materials but also by certain hourly wage scales.\r\n\r\nFor economic and social reasons our principal interest for the near future\r\nlies along two lines: first, the immediate desirability of increasing the\r\nwages of the lowest paid groups in all industry; and, second, in thinking\r\nin terms of regularizing the work of the individual worker more greatly\r\nthrough the year--in other words, in thinking more in terms of the worker's\r\ntotal pay for a period of a whole year rather than in terms of his\r\nremuneration by the hour or by the day.\r\n\r\nIn the case of labor as in the case of capital, misrepresentation of the\r\npolicy of the government of the United States is deception which will not\r\nlong deceive. In both cases we seek cooperation. In every case power and\r\nresponsibility must go hand in hand.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of economic causes which throw the Nation's income out of\r\nbalance; I have spoken of practices and abuses which demand correction\r\nthrough the cooperation of capital and labor with the government. But no\r\ngovernment can help the destinies of people who insist in putting sectional\r\nand class consciousness ahead of general weal. There must be proof that\r\nsectional and class interests are prepared more greatly than they are today\r\nto be national in outlook.\r\n\r\nA government can punish specific acts of spoliation; but no government can\r\nconscript cooperation. We have improved some matters by way of remedial\r\nlegislation. But where in some particulars that legislation has failed we\r\ncannot be sure whether it fails because some of its details are unwise or\r\nbecause it is being sabotaged. At any rate, we hold our objectives and our\r\nprinciples to be sound. We will never go back on them.\r\n\r\nGovernment has a final responsibility for the well-being of its\r\ncitizenship. If private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for\r\nwilling hands and relief for the unfortunate, those suffering hardship from\r\nno fault of their own have a right to call upon the Government for aid; and\r\na government worthy of its name must make fitting response.\r\n\r\nIt is the opportunity and the duty of all those who have faith in\r\ndemocratic methods as applied in industry, in agriculture and in business,\r\nas well as in the field of politics, to do their utmost to cooperate with\r\ngovernment--without regard to political affiliation, special interests or\r\neconomic prejudices--in whatever program may be sanctioned by the chosen\r\nrepresentatives of the people.\r\n\r\nThat presupposes on the part of the representatives of the people, a\r\nprogram, its enactment and its administration.\r\n\r\nNot because of the pledges of party programs alone, not because of the\r\nclear policies of the past five years, but chiefly because of the need of\r\nnational unity in ending mistakes of the past and meeting the necessities\r\nof today, we must carry on. I do not propose to let the people down.\r\n\r\nI am sure the Congress of the United States will not let the people down.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\r\nJanuary 4, 1939\r\n\r\nMr. Vice President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Senate and the Congress:\r\n\r\nIn Reporting on the state of the nation, I have felt it necessary on\r\nprevious occasions to advise the Congress of disturbance abroad and of the\r\nneed of putting our own house in order in the face of storm signals from\r\nacross the seas. As this Seventy-sixth Congress opens there is need for\r\nfurther warning.\r\n\r\nA war which threatened to envelop the world in flames has been averted; but\r\nit has become increasingly clear that world peace is not assured.\r\n\r\nAll about us rage undeclared wars--military and economic. All about us grow\r\nmore deadly armaments--military and economic. All about us are threats of\r\nnew aggression military and economic.\r\n\r\nStorms from abroad directly challenge three institutions indispensable to\r\nAmericans, now as always. The first is religion. It is the source of the\r\nother two--democracy and international good faith.\r\n\r\nReligion, by teaching man his relationship to God, gives the individual a\r\nsense of his own dignity and teaches him to respect himself by respecting\r\nhis neighbors.\r\n\r\nDemocracy, the practice of self-government, is a covenant among free men to\r\nrespect the rights and liberties of their fellows.\r\n\r\nInternational good faith, a sister of democracy, springs from the will of\r\ncivilized nations of men to respect the rights and liberties of other\r\nnations of men.\r\n\r\nIn a modern civilization, all three--religion, democracy and international\r\ngood faith--complement and support each other.\r\n\r\nWhere freedom of religion has been attacked, the attack has come from\r\nsources opposed to democracy. Where democracy has been overthrown, the\r\nspirit of free worship has disappeared. And where religion and democracy\r\nhave vanished, good faith and reason in international affairs have given\r\nway to strident ambition and brute force.\r\n\r\nAn ordering of society which relegates religion, democracy and good faith\r\namong nations to the background can find no place within it for the ideals\r\nof the Prince of Peace. The United States rejects such an ordering, and\r\nretains its ancient faith.\r\n\r\nThere comes a time in the affairs of men when they must prepare to defend,\r\nnot their homes alone, but the tenets of faith and humanity on which their\r\nchurches, their governments and their very civilization are founded. The\r\ndefense of religion, of democracy and of good faith among nations is all\r\nthe same fight. To save one we must now make up our minds to save all.\r\n\r\nWe know what might happen to us of the United States if the new\r\nphilosophies of force were to encompass the other continents and invade our\r\nown. We, no more than other nations, can afford to be surrounded by the\r\nenemies of our faith and our humanity. Fortunate it is, therefore, that in\r\nthis Western Hemisphere we have, under a common ideal of democratic\r\ngovernment, a rich diversity of resources and of peoples functioning\r\ntogether in mutual respect and peace.\r\n\r\nThat Hemisphere, that peace, and that ideal we propose to do our share in\r\nprotecting against storms from any quarter. Our people and our resources\r\nare pledged to secure that protection. From that determination no American\r\nflinches.\r\n\r\nThis by no means implies that the American Republics disassociate\r\nthemselves from the nations of other continents. It does not mean the\r\nAmericas against the rest of the world. We as one of the Republics\r\nreiterate our willingness to help the cause of world peace. We stand on our\r\nhistoric offer to take counsel with all other nations of the world to the\r\nend that aggression among them be terminated, that the race of armaments\r\ncease and that commerce be renewed.\r\n\r\nBut the world has grown so small and weapons of attack so swift that no\r\nnation can be safe in its will to peace so long as any other powerful\r\nnation refuses to settle its grievances at the council table.\r\n\r\nFor if any government bristling with implements of war insists on policies\r\nof force, weapons of defense give the only safety.\r\n\r\nIn our foreign relations we have learned from the past what not to do. From\r\nnew wars we have learned what we must do.\r\n\r\nWe have learned that effective timing of defense, and the distant points\r\nfrom which attacks may be launched are completely different from what they\r\nwere twenty years ago.\r\n\r\nWe have learned that survival cannot be guaranteed by arming after the\r\nattack begins--for there is new range and speed to offense.\r\n\r\nWe have learned that long before any overt military act, aggression begins\r\nwith preliminaries of propaganda, subsidized penetration, the loosening of\r\nties of good will, the stirring of prejudice and the incitement to\r\ndisunion.\r\n\r\nWe have learned that God-fearing democracies of the world which observe the\r\nsanctity of treaties and good faith in their dealings with other nations\r\ncannot safely be indifferent to international lawlessness anywhere. They\r\ncannot forever let pass, without effective protest, acts of aggression\r\nagainst sister nations--acts which automatically undermine all of us.\r\n\r\nObviously they must proceed along practical, peaceful lines. But the mere\r\nfact that we rightly decline to intervene with arms to prevent acts of\r\naggression does not mean that we must act as if there were no aggression at\r\nall. Words may be futile, but war is not the only means of commanding a\r\ndecent respect for the opinions of mankind. There are many methods short of\r\nwar, but stronger and more effective than mere words, of bringing home to\r\naggressor governments the aggregate sentiments of our own people.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, we can and should avoid any action, or any lack of\r\naction, which will encourage, assist or build up an aggressor. We have\r\nlearned that when we deliberately try to legislate neutrality, our\r\nneutrality laws may operate unevenly and unfairly--may actually give aid to\r\nan aggressor and deny it to the victim. The instinct of self-preservation\r\nshould warn us that we ought not to let that happen any more.\r\n\r\nAnd we have learned something else--the old, old lesson that probability of\r\nattack is mightily decreased by the assurance of an ever ready defense.\r\nSince 1931, nearly eight years ago, world events of thunderous import have\r\nmoved with lightning speed. During these eight years many of our people\r\nclung to the hope that the innate decency of mankind would protect the\r\nunprepared who showed their innate trust in mankind. Today we are all\r\nwiser--and sadder.\r\n\r\nUnder modern conditions what we mean by \"adequate defense\"--a policy\r\nsubscribed to by all of us--must be divided into three elements. First, we\r\nmust have armed forces and defenses strong enough to ward off sudden attack\r\nagainst strategic positions and key facilities essential to ensure\r\nsustained resistance and ultimate victory. Secondly, we must have the\r\norganization and location of those key facilities so that they may be\r\nimmediately utilized and rapidly expanded to meet all needs without danger\r\nof serious interruption by enemy attack.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a few days I shall send you a special message making\r\nrecommendations for those two essentials of defense against danger which we\r\ncannot safely assume will not come.\r\n\r\nIf these first two essentials are reasonably provided for, we must be able\r\nconfidently to invoke the third element, the underlying strength of\r\ncitizenship--the self-confidence, the ability, the imagination and the\r\ndevotion that give the staying power to see things through.\r\n\r\nA strong and united nation may be destroyed if it is unprepared against\r\nsudden attack. But even a nation well armed and well organized from a\r\nstrictly military standpoint may, after a period of time, meet defeat if it\r\nis unnerved by self-distrust, endangered by class prejudice, by dissension\r\nbetween capital and labor, by false economy and by other unsolved social\r\nproblems at home.\r\n\r\nIn meeting the troubles of the world we must meet them as one people--with a\r\nunity born of the fact that for generations those who have come to our\r\nshores, representing many kindreds and tongues, have been welded by common\r\nopportunity into a united patriotism. If another form of government can\r\npresent a united front in its attack on a democracy, the attack must and\r\nwill be met by a united democracy. Such a democracy can and must exist in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nA dictatorship may command the full strength of a regimented nation. But\r\nthe united strength of a democratic nation can be mustered only when its\r\npeople, educated by modern standards to know what is going on and where\r\nthey are going, have conviction that they are receiving as large a share of\r\nopportunity for development, as large a share of material success and of\r\nhuman dignity, as they have a right to receive.\r\n\r\nOur nation's program of social and economic reform is therefore a part of\r\ndefense, as basic as armaments themselves.\r\n\r\nAgainst the background of events in Europe, in Africa and in Asia during\r\nthese recent years, the pattern of what we have accomplished since 1933\r\nappears in even clearer focus.\r\n\r\nFor the first time we have moved upon deep-seated problems affecting our\r\nnational strength and have forged national instruments adequate to meet\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nConsider what the seemingly piecemeal struggles of these six years add up\r\nto in terms of realistic national preparedness.\r\n\r\nWe are conserving and developing natural resources--land, water power,\r\nforests.\r\n\r\nWe are trying to provide necessary food, shelter and medical care for the\r\nhealth of our population.\r\n\r\nWe are putting agriculture--our system of food and fibre supply--on a\r\nsounder basis.\r\n\r\nWe are strengthening the weakest spot in our system of industrial supply--\r\nits long smouldering labor difficulties.\r\n\r\nWe have cleaned up our credit system so that depositor and investor alike\r\nmay more readily and willingly make their capital available for peace or\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nWe are giving to our youth new opportunities for work and education.\r\n\r\nWe have sustained the morale of all the population by the dignified\r\nrecognition of our obligations to the aged, the helpless and the needy.\r\n\r\nAbove all, we have made the American people conscious of their\r\ninterrelationship and their interdependence. They sense a common destiny\r\nand a common need of each other. Differences of occupation, geography, race\r\nand religion no longer obscure the nation's fundamental unity in thought\r\nand in action.\r\n\r\nWe have our difficulties, true--but we are a wiser and a tougher nation than\r\nwe were in 1929, or in 1932.\r\n\r\nNever have there been six years of such far-flung internal preparedness in\r\nour history. And this has been done without any dictator's power to\r\ncommand, without conscription of labor or confiscation of capital, without\r\nconcentration camps and without a scratch on freedom of speech, freedom of\r\nthe press or the rest of the Bill of Rights.\r\n\r\nWe see things now that we could not see along the way. The tools of\r\ngovernment which we had in 1933 are outmoded. We have had to forge new\r\ntools for a new role of government operating in a democracy--a role of new\r\nresponsibility for new needs and increased responsibility for old needs,\r\nlong neglected.\r\n\r\nSome of these tools had to be roughly shaped and still need some machining\r\ndown. Many of those who fought bitterly against the forging of these new\r\ntools welcome their use today. The American people, as a whole, have\r\naccepted them. The Nation looks to the Congress to improve the new\r\nmachinery which we have permanently installed, provided that in the process\r\nthe social usefulness of the machinery is not destroyed or impaired.\r\n\r\nAll of us agree that we should simplify and improve laws if experience and\r\noperation clearly demonstrate the need. For instance, all of us want better\r\nprovision for our older people under our social security legislation. For\r\nthe medically needy we must provide better care.\r\n\r\nMost of us agree that for the sake of employer and employee alike we must\r\nfind ways to end factional labor strife and employer-employee disputes.\r\n\r\nMost of us recognize that none of these tools can be put to maximum\r\neffectiveness unless the executive processes of government are\r\nrevamped--reorganized, if you will--into more effective combination. And\r\neven after such reorganization it will take time to develop administrative\r\npersonnel and experience in order to use our new tools with a minimum of\r\nmistakes. The Congress, of course, needs no further information on this.\r\n\r\nWith this exception of legislation to provide greater government\r\nefficiency, and with the exception of legislation to ameliorate our\r\nrailroad and other transportation problems, the past three Congresses have\r\nmet in part or in whole the pressing needs of the new order of things.\r\n\r\nWe have now passed the period of internal conflict in the launching of our\r\nprogram of social reform. Our full energies may now be released to\r\ninvigorate the processes of recovery in order to preserve our reforms, and\r\nto give every man and woman who wants to work a real job at a living wage.\r\n\r\nBut time is of paramount importance. The deadline of danger from within and\r\nfrom without is not within our control. The hour-glass may be in the hands\r\nof other nations. Our own hour-glass tells us that we are off on a race to\r\nmake democracy work, so that we may be efficient in peace and therefore\r\nsecure in national defense.\r\n\r\nThis time element forces us to still greater efforts to attain the full\r\nemployment of our labor and our capital.\r\n\r\nThe first duty of our statesmanship is to bring capital and man-power\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nDictatorships do this by main force. By using main force they apparently\r\nsucceed at it--for the moment. However we abhor their methods, we are\r\ncompelled to admit that they have obtained substantial utilization of all\r\ntheir material and human resources. Like it or not, they have solved, for a\r\ntime at least, the problem of idle men and idle capital. Can we compete\r\nwith them by boldly seeking methods of putting idle men and idle capital\r\ntogether and, at the same time, remain within our American way of life,\r\nwithin the Bill of Rights, and within the bounds of what is, from our point\r\nof view, civilization itself?\r\n\r\nWe suffer from a great unemployment of capital. Many people have the idea\r\nthat as a nation we are overburdened with debt and are spending more than\r\nwe can afford. That is not so. Despite our Federal Government expenditures\r\nthe entire debt of our national economic system, public and private\r\ntogether, is no larger today than it was in 1929, and the interest thereon\r\nis far less than it was in 1929.\r\n\r\nThe object is to put capital--private as well as public--to work.\r\n\r\nWe want to get enough capital and labor at work to give us a total turnover\r\nof business, a total national income, of at least eighty billion dollars a\r\nyear. At that figure we shall have a substantial reduction of unemployment;\r\nand the Federal Revenues will be sufficient to balance the current level of\r\ncash expenditures on the basis of the existing tax structure. That figure\r\ncan be attained, working within the framework of our traditional profit\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe factors in attaining and maintaining that amount of national income are\r\nmany and complicated.\r\n\r\nThey include more widespread understanding among business men of many\r\nchanges which world conditions and technological improvements have brought\r\nto our economy over the last twenty years--changes in the interrelationship\r\nof price and volume and employment, for example--changes of the kind in\r\nwhich business men are now educating themselves through excellent\r\nopportunities like the so-called \"monopoly investigation.\"\r\n\r\nThey include a perfecting of our farm program to protect farmers' income\r\nand consumers' purchasing power from alternate risks of crop gluts and crop\r\nshortages.\r\n\r\nThey include wholehearted acceptance of new standards of honesty in our\r\nfinancial markets.\r\n\r\nThey include reconcilement of enormous, antagonistic interests--some of them\r\nlong in litigation--in the railroad and general transportation field.\r\n\r\nThey include the working out of new techniques--private, state and\r\nfederal--to protect the public interest in and to develop wider markets for\r\nelectric power.\r\n\r\nThey include a revamping of the tax relationships between federal, state\r\nand local units of government, and consideration of relatively small tax\r\nincreases to adjust inequalities without interfering with the aggregate\r\nincome of the American people.\r\n\r\nThey include the perfecting of labor organization and a universal\r\nungrudging attitude by employers toward the labor movement, until there is\r\na minimum of interruption of production and employment because of disputes,\r\nand acceptance by labor of the truth that the welfare of labor itself\r\ndepends on increased balanced out-put of goods.\r\n\r\nTo be immediately practical, while proceeding with a steady evolution in\r\nthe solving of these and like problems, we must wisely use\r\ninstrumentalities, like Federal investment, which are immediately available\r\nto us.\r\n\r\nHere, as elsewhere, time is the deciding factor in our choice of remedies.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it does not seem logical to me, at the moment we seek to\r\nincrease production and consumption, for the Federal Government to consider\r\na drastic curtailment of its own investments.\r\n\r\nThe whole subject of government investing and government income is one\r\nwhich may be approached in two different ways.\r\n\r\nThe first calls for the elimination of enough activities of government to\r\nbring the expenses of government immediately into balance with income of\r\ngovernment. This school of thought maintains that because our national\r\nincome this year is only sixty billion dollars, ours is only a sixty\r\nbillion dollar country; that government must treat it as such; and that\r\nwithout the help of government, it may some day, somehow, happen to become\r\nan eighty billion dollar country.\r\n\r\nIf the Congress decides to accept this point of view, it will logically\r\nhave to reduce the present functions or activities of government by\r\none-third. Not only will the Congress have to accept the responsibility for\r\nsuch reduction; but the Congress will have to determine which activities\r\nare to be reduced.\r\n\r\nCertain expenditures we cannot possibly reduce at this session, such as the\r\ninterest on the public debt. A few million dollars saved here or there in\r\nthe normal or in curtailed work of the old departments and commissions will\r\nmake no great saving in the Federal budget. Therefore, the Congress would\r\nhave to reduce drastically some of certain large items, very large items,\r\nsuch as aids to agriculture and soil conservation, veterans' pensions,\r\nflood control, highways, waterways and other public works, grants for\r\nsocial and health security, Civilian Conservation Corps activities, relief\r\nfor the unemployed, or national defense itself.\r\n\r\nThe Congress alone has the power to do all this, as it is the appropriating\r\nbranch of the government.\r\n\r\nThe other approach to the question of government spending takes the\r\nposition that this Nation ought not to be and need not be only a sixty\r\nbillion dollar nation; that at this moment it has the men and the resources\r\nsufficient to make it at least an eighty billion dollar nation. This school\r\nof thought does not believe that it can become an eighty billion dollar\r\nnation in the near future if government cuts its operations by one-third.\r\nIt is convinced that if we were to try it, we would invite disaster--and\r\nthat we would not long remain even a sixty billion dollar nation. There are\r\nmany complicated factors with which we have to deal, but we have learned\r\nthat it is unsafe to make abrupt reductions at any time in our net\r\nexpenditure program.\r\n\r\nBy our common sense action of resuming government activities last spring,\r\nwe have reversed a recession and started the new rising tide of prosperity\r\nand national income which we are now just beginning to enjoy.\r\n\r\nIf government activities are fully maintained, there is a good prospect of\r\nour becoming an eighty billion dollar country in a very short time. With\r\nsuch a national income, present tax laws will yield enough each year to\r\nbalance each year's expenses.\r\n\r\nIt is my conviction that down in their hearts the American public--industry,\r\nagriculture, finance--want this Congress to do whatever needs to be done to\r\nraise our national income to eighty billion dollars a year.\r\n\r\nInvesting soundly must preclude spending wastefully. To guard against\r\nopportunist appropriations, I have on several occasions addressed the\r\nCongress on the importance of permanent long-range planning. I hope,\r\ntherefore, that following my recommendation of last year, a permanent\r\nagency will be set up and authorized to report on the urgency and\r\ndesirability of the various types of government investment.\r\n\r\nInvestment for prosperity can be made in a democracy.\r\n\r\nI hear some people say, \"This is all so complicated. There are certain\r\nadvantages in a dictatorship. It gets rid of labor trouble, of\r\nunemployment, of wasted motion and of having to do your own thinking.\"\r\n\r\nMy answer is, \"Yes, but it also gets rid of some other things which we\r\nAmericans intend very definitely to keep--and we still intend to do our own\r\nthinking.\"\r\n\r\nIt will cost us taxes and the voluntary risk of capital to attain some of\r\nthe practical advantages which other forms of government have acquired.\r\n\r\nDictatorship, however, involves costs which the American people will never\r\npay: The cost of our spiritual values. The cost of the blessed right of\r\nbeing able to say what we please. The cost of freedom of religion. The cost\r\nof seeing our capital confiscated. The cost of being cast into a\r\nconcentration camp. The cost of being afraid to walk down the street with\r\nthe wrong neighbor. The cost of having our children brought up, not as free\r\nand dignified human beings, but as pawns molded and enslaved by a machine.\r\n\r\nIf the avoidance of these costs means taxes on my income; if avoiding these\r\ncosts means taxes on my estate at death, I would bear those taxes willingly\r\nas the price of my breathing and my children breathing the free air of a\r\nfree country, as the price of a living and not a dead world.\r\n\r\nEvents abroad have made it increasingly clear to the American people that\r\ndangers within are less to be feared than dangers from without. If,\r\ntherefore, a solution of this problem of idle men and idle capital is the\r\nprice of preserving our liberty, no formless selfish fears can stand in the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nOnce I prophesied that this generation of Americans had a rendezvous with\r\ndestiny. That prophecy comes true. To us much is given; more is expected.\r\n\r\nThis generation will \"nobly save or meanly lose the last best hope of\r\nearth. . . . The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just--a way which if\r\nfollowed the world will forever applaud and God must forever bless.\"\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\r\nJanuary 3, 1940\r\n\r\nMr. Vice President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Senate and the House of\r\nRepresentatives:\r\n\r\nI wish each and every one of you a very happy New Year.\r\n\r\nAs the Congress reassembles, the impact of war abroad makes it natural to\r\napproach \"the state of the union\" through a discussion of foreign affairs.\r\n\r\nBut it is important that those who hear and read this message should in no\r\nway confuse that approach with any thought that our Government is\r\nabandoning, or even overlooking, the great significance of its domestic\r\npolicies.\r\n\r\nThe social and economic forces which have been mismanaged abroad until they\r\nhave resulted in revolution, dictatorship and war are the same as those\r\nwhich we here are struggling to adjust peacefully at home.\r\n\r\nYou are well aware that dictatorships--and the philosophy of force that\r\njustifies and accompanies dictatorships--have originated in almost every\r\ncase in the necessity for drastic action to improve internal conditions in\r\nplaces where democratic action for one reason or another has failed to\r\nrespond to modern needs and modern demands.\r\n\r\nIt was with far-sighted wisdom that the framers of our Constitution brought\r\ntogether in one magnificent phrase three great concepts--\"common defense,\"\r\n\"general welfare\" and \"domestic tranquility.\"\r\n\r\nMore than a century and a half later we, who are here today, still believe\r\nwith them that our best defense is the promotion of our general welfare and\r\ndomestic tranquillity.\r\n\r\nIn previous messages to the Congress I have repeatedly warned that, whether\r\nwe like it or not, the daily lives of American citizens will, of necessity,\r\nfeel the shock of events on other continents. This is no longer mere\r\ntheory; because it has been definitely proved to us by the facts of\r\nyesterday and today.\r\n\r\nTo say that the domestic well-being of one hundred and thirty million\r\nAmericans is deeply affected by the well-being or the ill-being of the\r\npopulations of other nations is only to recognize in world affairs the\r\ntruth that we all accept in home affairs.\r\n\r\nIf in any local unit--a city, county, State or region--low standards of\r\nliving are permitted to continue, the level of the civilization of the\r\nentire nation will be pulled downward.\r\n\r\nThe identical principle extends to the rest of the civilized world. But\r\nthere are those who wishfully insist, in innocence or ignorance or both,\r\nthat the United States of America as a self-contained unit can live happily\r\nand prosperously, its future secure, inside a high wall of isolation while,\r\noutside, the rest of Civilization and the commerce and culture of mankind\r\nare shattered.\r\n\r\nI can understand the feelings of those who warn the nation that they will\r\nnever again consent to the sending of American youth to fight on the soil\r\nof Europe. But, as I remember, nobody has asked them to consent--for nobody\r\nexpects such an undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming majority of our fellow citizens do not abandon in the\r\nslightest their hope and their expectation that the United States will not\r\nbecome involved in military participation in these wars.\r\n\r\nI can also understand the wishfulness of those who oversimplify the whole\r\nsituation by repeating that all we have to do is to mind our own business\r\nand keep the nation out of war. But there is a vast difference between\r\nkeeping out of war and pretending that this war is none of our business.\r\n\r\nWe do not have to go to war with other nations, but at least we can strive\r\nwith other nations to encourage the kind of peace that will lighten the\r\ntroubles of the world, and by so doing help our own nation as well.\r\n\r\nI ask that all of us everywhere think things through with the single aim of\r\nhow best to serve the future of our own nation. I do not mean merely its\r\nfuture relationship with the outside world. I mean its domestic future as\r\nwell--the work, the security, the prosperity, the happiness, the life of all\r\nthe boys and girls in the United States, as they are inevitably affected by\r\nsuch world relationships. For it becomes clearer and clearer that the\r\nfuture world will be a shabby and dangerous place to live in--yes, even for\r\nAmericans to live in--if it is ruled by force in the hands of a few.\r\n\r\nAlready the crash of swiftly moving events over the earth has made us all\r\nthink with a longer view. Fortunately, that thinking cannot be controlled\r\nby partisanship. The time is long past when any political party or any\r\nparticular group can curry or capture public favor by labeling itself the\r\n\"peace party\" or the \"peace bloc.\" That label belongs to the whole United\r\nStates and to every right thinking man, woman and child within it.\r\n\r\nFor out of all the military and diplomatic turmoil, out of all the\r\npropaganda, and counter-propaganda of the present conflicts, there are two\r\nfacts which stand out, and which the whole world acknowledges.\r\n\r\nThe first is that never before has the Government of the United States of\r\nAmerica done so much as in our recent past to establish and maintain the\r\npolicy of the Good Neighbor with its sister nations.\r\n\r\nThe second is that in almost every nation in the world today there is a\r\ntrue public belief that the United States has been, and will continue to\r\nbe, a potent and active factor in seeking the reestablishment of world\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nIn these recent years we have had a clean record of peace and good-will. It\r\nis an open book that cannot be twisted or defamed. It is a record that must\r\nbe continued and enlarged.\r\n\r\nSo I hope that Americans everywhere will work out for themselves the\r\nseveral alternatives which lie before world civilization, which necessarily\r\nincludes our own.\r\n\r\nWe must look ahead and see the possibilities for our children if the rest\r\nof the world comes to be dominated by concentrated force alone--even though\r\ntoday we are a very great and a very powerful nation.\r\n\r\nWe must look ahead and see the effect on our own future if all the small\r\nnations of the world have their independence snatched from them or become\r\nmere appendages to relatively vast and powerful military systems.\r\n\r\nWe must look ahead and see the kind of lives our children would have to\r\nlead if a large part of the rest of the world were compelled to worship a\r\ngod imposed by a military ruler, or were forbidden to worship God at all;\r\nif the rest of the world were forbidden to read and hear the facts--the\r\ndaily news of their own and other nations--if they were deprived of the\r\ntruth that makes men free.\r\n\r\nWe must look ahead and see the effect on our future generations if world\r\ntrade is controlled by any nation or group of nations which sets up that\r\ncontrol through military force.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, true that the record of past centuries includes\r\ndestruction of many small nations, the enslavement of peoples, and the\r\nbuilding of empires on the foundation of force. But wholly apart from the\r\ngreater international morality which we seek today, we recognize the\r\npractical fact that with modern weapons and modern conditions, modern man\r\ncan no longer lead a civilized life if we are to go back to the practice of\r\nwars and conquests of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nSumming up this need of looking ahead, and in words of common sense and\r\ngood American citizenship. I hope that we shall have fewer American\r\nostriches in our midst. It is not good for the ultimate health of ostriches\r\nto bury their heads in the sand.\r\n\r\nOnly an ostrich would look upon these wars through the eyes of cynicism or\r\nridicule.\r\n\r\nOf course, the peoples of other nations have the right to choose their own\r\nform of Government. But we in this nation still believe that such choice\r\nshould be predicated on certain freedoms which we think are essential\r\neverywhere. We know that we ourselves shall never be wholly safe at home\r\nunless other governments recognize such freedoms.\r\n\r\nTwenty-one American Republics, expressing the will of two hundred and fifty\r\nmillion people to preserve peace and freedom in this Hemisphere, are\r\ndisplaying a unanimity of ideals and practical relationships which gives\r\nhope that what is being done here can be done on other continents. We in\r\nall the Americas are coming to the realization that we can retain our\r\nrespective nationalities without, at the same time, threatening the\r\nnational existence of our neighbors.\r\n\r\nSuch truly friendly relationships, for example, permit us to follow our own\r\ndomestic policies with reference to our agricultural products, while at the\r\nsame time we have the privilege of trying to work out mutual assistance\r\narrangements for a world distribution of world agricultural surpluses.\r\n\r\nAnd we have been able to apply the same simple principle to many\r\nmanufactured products--surpluses of which must be sold in the world export\r\nmarkets if we intend to continue a high level of production and\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\nFor many years after the World War blind economic selfishness in most\r\ncountries, including our own, resulted in a destructive mine-field of trade\r\nrestrictions which blocked the channels of commerce among nations. Indeed,\r\nthis policy was one of the contributing causes of existing wars. It dammed\r\nup vast unsalable surpluses, helping to bring about unemployment and\r\nsuffering in the United States and everywhere else.\r\n\r\nTo point the way to break up that log-jam our Trade Agreements Act was\r\npassed--based upon a policy of equality of treatment among nations and of\r\nmutually profitable arrangements of trade.\r\n\r\nIt is not correct to infer that legislative powers have been transferred\r\nfrom the Congress to the Executive Branch of the Government. Everyone\r\nrecognizes that general tariff legislation is a Congressional function; but\r\nwe know that, because of the stupendous task involved in the fashioning and\r\nthe passing of a general tariff law, it is advisable to provide at times of\r\nemergency some flexibility to make the general law adjustable to quickly\r\nchanging conditions.\r\n\r\nWe are in such a time today. Our present trade agreement method provides a\r\ntemporary flexibility and is, therefore, practical in the best sense. It\r\nshould be kept alive to serve our trade interests--agricultural and\r\nindustrial--in many valuable ways during the existing wars.\r\n\r\nBut what is more important, the Trade Agreements Act should be extended as\r\nan indispensable part of the foundation of any stable and enduring peace.\r\n\r\nThe old conditions of world trade made for no enduring peace; and when the\r\ntime comes, the United States must use its influence to open up the trade\r\nchannels of the world, in all nations, in order that no one nation need\r\nfeel compelled in later days to seek by force of arms what it can well gain\r\nby peaceful conference. For that purpose, too, we need the Trade Agreements\r\nAct even more today than when it was passed.\r\n\r\nI emphasize the leadership which this nation can take when the time comes\r\nfor a renewal of world peace. Such an influence will be greatly weakened if\r\nthis Government becomes a dog in the manger of trade selfishness.\r\n\r\nThe first President of the United States warned us against entangling\r\nforeign alliances. The present President of the United States subscribes to\r\nand follows that precept.\r\n\r\nI hope that most of you will agree that trade cooperation with the rest of\r\nthe world does not violate that precept in any way.\r\n\r\nEven as through these trade agreements we prepare to cooperate in a world\r\nthat wants peace, we must likewise be prepared to take care of ourselves if\r\nthe world cannot attain peace.\r\n\r\nFor several years past we have been compelled to strengthen our own\r\nnational defense. That has created a very large portion of our Treasury\r\ndeficits. This year in the light of continuing world uncertainty, I am\r\nasking the Congress for Army and Navy increases which are based not on\r\npanic but on common sense. They are not as great as enthusiastic alarmists\r\nseek. They are not as small as unrealistic persons claiming superior\r\nprivate information would demand.\r\n\r\nAs will appear in the annual budget tomorrow, the only important increase\r\nin any part of the budget is the estimate for national defense. Practically\r\nall other important items show a reduction. But you know, you can't eat\r\nyour cake and have it too. Therefore, in the hope that we can continue in\r\nthese days of increasing economic prosperity to reduce the Federal deficit,\r\nI am asking the Congress to levy sufficient additional taxes to meet the\r\nemergency spending for national defense.\r\n\r\nBehind the Army and Navy, of course, lies our ultimate line of defense--\"the\r\ngeneral welfare\" of our people. We cannot report, despite all the progress\r\nthat we have made in our domestic problems--despite the fact that production\r\nis back to 1929 levels--that all our problems are solved. The fact of\r\nunemployment of millions of men and women remains a symptom of a number of\r\ndifficulties in our economic system not yet adjusted.\r\n\r\nWhile the number of the unemployed has decreased very greatly, while their\r\nimmediate needs for food and clothing--as far as the Federal Government is\r\nconcerned--have been largely met, while their morale has been kept alive by\r\ngiving them useful public work, we have not yet found a way to employ the\r\nsurplus of our labor which the efficiency of our industrial processes has\r\ncreated.\r\n\r\nWe refuse the European solution of using the unemployed to build up\r\nexcessive armaments which eventually result in dictatorships and war. We\r\nencourage an American way--through an increase of national income which is\r\nthe only way we can be sure will take up the slack. Much progress has been\r\nmade; much remains to be done.\r\n\r\nWe recognize that we must find an answer in terms of work and opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe unemployment problem today has become very definitely a problem of\r\nyouth as well as of age. As each year has gone by hundreds of thousands of\r\nboys and girls have come of working age. They now form an army of unused\r\nyouth. They must be an especial concern of democratic Government.\r\n\r\nWe must continue, above all things, to look for a solution of their special\r\nproblem. For they, looking ahead to life, are entitled to action on our\r\npart and not merely to admonitions of optimism or lectures on economic\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nSome in our midst have sought to instill a feeling of fear and defeatism in\r\nthe minds of the American people about this problem.\r\n\r\nTo face the task of finding jobs faster than invention can take them\r\naway--is not defeatism. To warble easy platitudes that if we would only go\r\nback to ways that have failed, everything would be all right--is not\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\nIn 1933 we met a problem of real fear and real defeatism. We faced the\r\nfacts--with action and not with words alone.\r\n\r\nThe American people will reject the doctrine of fear, confident that in the\r\n'thirties we have been building soundly a new order of things, different\r\nfrom the order of the 'twenties. In this dawn of the decade of the\r\n'forties, with our program of social improvement started, we will continue\r\nto carry on the processes of recovery, so as to preserve our gains and\r\nprovide jobs at living wages.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, many other items of great public interest which could\r\nbe enumerated in this message--the continued conservation of our natural\r\nresources, the improvement of health and of education, the extension of\r\nsocial security to larger groups, the freeing of large areas from\r\nrestricted transportation discriminations, the extension of the merit\r\nsystem and many others.\r\n\r\nOur continued progress in the social and economic field is important not\r\nonly for the significance of each part of it but for the total effect which\r\nour program of domestic betterment has upon that most valuable asset of a\r\nnation in dangerous times--its national unity.\r\n\r\nThe permanent security of America in the present crisis does not lie in\r\narmed force alone. What we face is a set of world-wide forces of\r\ndisintegration--vicious, ruthless, destructive of all the moral, religious\r\nand political standards which mankind, after centuries of struggle, has\r\ncome to cherish most.\r\n\r\nIn these moral values, in these forces which have made our nation great, we\r\nmust actively and practically reassert our faith.\r\n\r\nThese words--\"national unity\"--must not be allowed to be come merely a\r\nhigh-sounding phrase, a vague generality, a pious hope, to which everyone\r\ncan give lip-service. They must be made to have real meaning in terms of\r\nthe daily thoughts and acts of every man, woman and child in our land\r\nduring the coming year and during the years that lie ahead.\r\n\r\nFor national unity is, in a very real and a very deep sense, the\r\nfundamental safeguard of all democracy.\r\n\r\nDoctrines that set group against group, faith against faith, race against\r\nrace, class against class, fanning the fires of hatred in men too\r\ndespondent, too desperate to think for themselves, were used as\r\nrabble-rousing slogans on which dictators could ride to power. And once in\r\npower they could saddle their tyrannies on whole nations and on their\r\nweaker neighbors.\r\n\r\nThis is the danger to which we in America must begin to be more alert. For\r\nthe apologists for foreign aggressors, and equally those selfish and\r\npartisan groups at home who wrap themselves in a false mantle of\r\nAmericanism to promote their own economic, financial or political\r\nadvantage, are now trying European tricks upon us, seeking to muddy the\r\nstream of our national thinking, weakening us in the face of danger, by\r\ntrying to set our own people to fighting among themselves. Such tactics are\r\nwhat have helped to plunge Europe into war. We must combat them, as we\r\nwould the plague, if American integrity and American security are to be\r\npreserved. We cannot afford to face the future as a disunited people.\r\n\r\nWe must as a united people keep ablaze on this continent the flames of\r\nhuman liberty, of reason, of democracy and of fair play as living things to\r\nbe preserved for the better world that is to come.\r\n\r\nOverstatement, bitterness, vituperation, and the beating of drums have\r\ncontributed mightily to ill-feeling and wars between nations. If these\r\nunnecessary and unpleasant actions are harmful in the international field,\r\nif they have hurt in other parts of the world, they are also harmful in the\r\ndomestic scene. Peace among ourselves would seem to have some of the\r\nadvantage of peace between us and other nations. In the long run history\r\namply demonstrates that angry controversy surely wins less than calm\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit, therefore, of a greater unselfishness, recognizing that the\r\nworld--including the United States of America--passes through perilous\r\ntimes, I am very hopeful that the closing session of the Seventy-sixth\r\nCongress will consider the needs of the nation and of humanity with\r\ncalmness, with tolerance and with cooperative wisdom.\r\n\r\nMay the year 1940 be pointed to by our children as another period when\r\ndemocracy justified its existence as the best instrument of government yet\r\ndevised by mankind.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\r\nJanuary 6, 1941\r\n\r\nMr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Seventy-seventh Congress:\r\n\r\nI address you, the Members of the Seventy-seventh Congress, at a moment\r\nunprecedented in the history of the Union. I use the word \"unprecedented,\"\r\nbecause at no previous time has American security been as seriously\r\nthreatened from without as it is today.\r\n\r\nSince the permanent formation of our Government under the Constitution, in\r\n1789, most of the periods of crisis in our history have related to our\r\ndomestic affairs. Fortunately, only one of these--the four-year War Between\r\nthe States--ever threatened our national unity. Today, thank God, one\r\nhundred and thirty million Americans, in forty-eight States, have forgotten\r\npoints of the compass in our national unity.\r\n\r\nIt is true that prior to 1914 the United States often had been disturbed by\r\nevents in other Continents. We had even engaged in two wars with European\r\nnations and in a number of undeclared wars in the West Indies, in the\r\nMediterranean and in the Pacific for the maintenance of American rights and\r\nfor the principles of peaceful commerce. But in no case had a serious\r\nthreat been raised against our national safety or our continued\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nWhat I seek to convey is the historic truth that the United States as a\r\nnation has at all times maintained clear, definite opposition, to any\r\nattempt to lock us in behind an ancient Chinese wall while the procession\r\nof civilization went past. Today, thinking of our children and of their\r\nchildren, we oppose enforced isolation for ourselves or for any other part\r\nof the Americas.\r\n\r\nThat determination of ours, extending over all these years, was proved, for\r\nexample, during the quarter century of wars following the French\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nWhile the Napoleonic struggles did threaten interests of the United States\r\nbecause of the French foothold in the West Indies and in Louisiana, and\r\nwhile we engaged in the War of 1812 to vindicate our right to peaceful\r\ntrade, it is nevertheless clear that neither France nor Great Britain, nor\r\nany other nation, was aiming at domination of the whole world.\r\n\r\nIn like fashion from 1815 to 1914--ninety-nine years--no single war in\r\nEurope or in Asia constituted a real threat against our future or against\r\nthe future of any other American nation.\r\n\r\nExcept in the Maximilian interlude in Mexico, no foreign power sought to\r\nestablish itself in this Hemisphere; and the strength of the British fleet\r\nin the Atlantic has been a friendly strength. It is still a friendly\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nEven when the World War broke out in 1914, it seemed to contain only small\r\nthreat of danger to our own American future. But, as time went on, the\r\nAmerican people began to visualize what the downfall of democratic nations\r\nmight mean to our own democracy.\r\n\r\nWe need not overemphasize imperfections in the Peace of Versailles. We need\r\nnot harp on failure of the democracies to deal with problems of world\r\nreconstruction. We should remember that the Peace of 1919 was far less\r\nunjust than the kind of \"pacification\" which began even before Munich, and\r\nwhich is being carried on under the new order of tyranny that seeks to\r\nspread over every continent today. The American people have unalterably set\r\ntheir faces against that tyranny.\r\n\r\nEvery realist knows that the democratic way of life is at this moment\r\nbeing directly assailed in every part of the world--assailed either by\r\narms, or by secret spreading of poisonous propaganda by those who seek to\r\ndestroy unity and promote discord in nations that are still at peace.\r\n\r\nDuring sixteen long months this assault has blotted out the whole pattern\r\nof democratic life in an appalling number of independent nations, great and\r\nsmall. The assailants are still on the march, threatening other nations,\r\ngreat and small.\r\n\r\nTherefore, as your President, performing my constitutional duty to \"give to\r\nthe Congress information of the state of the Union,\" I find it, unhappily,\r\nnecessary to report that the future and the safety of our country and of\r\nour democracy are overwhelmingly involved in events far beyond our\r\nborders.\r\n\r\nArmed defense of democratic existence is now being gallantly waged in four\r\ncontinents. If that defense fails, all the population and all the resources\r\nof Europe, Asia, Africa and Australasia will be dominated by the\r\nconquerors. Let us remember that the total of those populations and their\r\nresources in those four continents greatly exceeds the sum total of the\r\npopulation and the resources of the whole of the Western Hemisphere--many\r\ntimes over.\r\n\r\nIn times like these it is immature--and incidentally, untrue--for anybody to\r\nbrag that an unprepared America, single-handed, and with one hand tied\r\nbehind its back, can hold off the whole world.\r\n\r\nNo realistic American can expect from a dictator's peace international\r\ngenerosity, or return of true independence, or world disarmament, or\r\nfreedom of expression, or freedom of religion--or even good business.\r\n\r\nSuch a peace would bring no security for us or for our neighbors. \"Those,\r\nwho would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety,\r\ndeserve neither liberty nor safety.\"\r\n\r\nAs a nation, we may take pride in the fact that we are softhearted; but we\r\ncannot afford to be soft-headed.\r\n\r\nWe must always be wary of those who with sounding brass and a tinkling\r\ncymbal preach the \"ism\" of appeasement.\r\n\r\nWe must especially beware of that small group of selfish men who would clip\r\nthe wings of the American eagle in order to feather their own nests.\r\n\r\nI have recently pointed out how quickly the tempo of modern warfare could\r\nbring into our very midst the physical attack which we must eventually\r\nexpect if the dictator nations win this war.\r\n\r\nThere is much loose talk of our immunity from immediate and direct invasion\r\nfrom across the seas. Obviously, as long as the British Navy retains its\r\npower, no such danger exists. Even if there were no British Navy, it is not\r\nprobable that any enemy would be stupid enough to attack us by landing\r\ntroops in the United States from across thousands of miles of ocean, until\r\nit had acquired strategic bases from which to operate.\r\n\r\nBut we learn much from the lessons of the past years in Europe--particularly\r\nthe lesson of Norway, whose essential seaports were captured by treachery\r\nand surprise built up over a series of years.\r\n\r\nThe first phase of the invasion of this Hemisphere would not be the landing\r\nof regular troops. The necessary strategic points would be occupied by\r\nsecret agents and their dupes--and great numbers of them are already here,\r\nand in Latin America.\r\n\r\nAs long as the aggressor nations maintain the offensive, they--not we--will\r\nchoose the time and the place and the method of their attack.\r\n\r\nThat is why the future of all the American Republics is today in serious\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nThat is why this Annual Message to the Congress is unique in our history.\r\n\r\nThat is why every member of the Executive Branch of the Government and\r\nevery member of the Congress faces great responsibility and great\r\naccountability.\r\n\r\nThe need of the moment is that our actions and our policy should be devoted\r\nprimarily--almost exclusively--to meeting this foreign peril. For all our\r\ndomestic problems are now a part of the great emergency.\r\n\r\nJust as our national policy in internal affairs has been based upon a\r\ndecent respect for the rights and the dignity of all our fellow men within\r\nour gates, so our national policy in foreign affairs has been based on a\r\ndecent respect for the rights and dignity of all nations, large and small.\r\nAnd the justice of morality must and will win in the end.\r\n\r\nOur national policy is this:\r\n\r\nFirst, by an impressive expression of the public will and without regard to\r\npartisanship, we are committed to all-inclusive national defense.\r\n\r\nSecond, by an impressive expression of the public will and without regard\r\nto partisanship, we are committed to full support of all those resolute\r\npeoples, everywhere, who are resisting aggression and are thereby keeping\r\nwar away from our Hemisphere. By this support, we express our determination\r\nthat the democratic cause shall prevail; and we strengthen the defense and\r\nthe security of our own nation.\r\n\r\nThird, by an impressive expression of the public will and without regard to\r\npartisanship, we are committed to the proposition that principles of\r\nmorality and considerations for our own security will never permit us to\r\nacquiesce in a peace dictated by aggressors and sponsored by appeasers. We\r\nknow that enduring peace cannot be bought at the cost of other people's\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nIn the recent national election there was no substantial difference between\r\nthe two great parties in respect to that national policy. No issue was\r\nfought out on this line before the American electorate. Today it is\r\nabundantly evident that American citizens everywhere are demanding and\r\nsupporting speedy and complete action in recognition of obvious danger.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the immediate need is a swift and driving increase in our\r\narmament production.\r\n\r\nLeaders of industry and labor have responded to our summons. Goals of speed\r\nhave been set. In some cases these goals are being reached ahead of time;\r\nin some cases we are on schedule; in other cases there are slight but not\r\nserious delays; and in some cases--and I am sorry to say very important\r\ncases--we are all concerned by the slowness of the accomplishment of our\r\nplans.\r\n\r\nThe Army and Navy, however, have made substantial progress during the past\r\nyear. Actual experience is improving and speeding up our methods of\r\nproduction with every passing day. And today's best is not good enough for\r\ntomorrow.\r\n\r\nI am not satisfied with the progress thus far made. The men in charge of\r\nthe program represent the best in training, in ability, and in patriotism.\r\nThey are not satisfied with the progress thus far made. None of us will be\r\nsatisfied until the job is done.\r\n\r\nNo matter whether the original goal was set too high or too low, our\r\nobjective is quicker and better results. To give you two illustrations:\r\n\r\nWe are behind schedule in turning out finished airplanes; we are working\r\nday and night to solve the innumerable problems and to catch up.\r\n\r\nWe are ahead of schedule in building warships but we are working to get\r\neven further ahead of that schedule.\r\n\r\nTo change a whole nation from a basis of peacetime production of implements\r\nof peace to a basis of wartime production of implements of war is no small\r\ntask. And the greatest difficulty comes at the beginning of the program,\r\nwhen new tools, new plant facilities, new assembly lines, and new ship ways\r\nmust first be constructed before the actual materiel begins to flow\r\nsteadily and speedily from them.\r\n\r\nThe Congress, of course, must rightly keep itself informed at all times of\r\nthe progress of the program. However, there is certain information, as the\r\nCongress itself will readily recognize, which, in the interests of our own\r\nsecurity and those of the nations that we are supporting, must of needs be\r\nkept in confidence.\r\n\r\nNew circumstances are constantly begetting new needs for our safety. I\r\nshall ask this Congress for greatly increased new appropriations and\r\nauthorizations to carry on what we have begun.\r\n\r\nI also ask this Congress for authority and for funds sufficient to\r\nmanufacture additional munitions and war supplies of many kinds, to be\r\nturned over to those nations which are now in actual war with aggressor\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nOur most useful and immediate role is to act as an arsenal for them as well\r\nas for ourselves. They do not need man power, but they do need billions of\r\ndollars worth of the weapons of defense.\r\n\r\nThe time is near when they will not be able to pay for them all in ready\r\ncash. We cannot, and we will not, tell them that they must surrender,\r\nmerely because of present inability to pay for the weapons which we know\r\nthey must have.\r\n\r\nI do not recommend that we make them a loan of dollars with which to pay\r\nfor these weapons--a loan to be repaid in dollars.\r\n\r\nI recommend that we make it possible for those nations to continue to\r\nobtain war materials in the United States, fitting their orders into our\r\nown program. Nearly all their materiel would, if the time ever came, be\r\nuseful for our own defense.\r\n\r\nTaking counsel of expert military and naval authorities, considering what\r\nis best for our own security, we are free to decide how much should be kept\r\nhere and how much should be sent abroad to our friends who by their\r\ndetermined and heroic resistance are giving us time in which to make ready\r\nour own defense.\r\n\r\nFor what we send abroad, we shall be repaid within a reasonable time\r\nfollowing the close of hostilities, in similar materials, or, at our\r\noption, in other goods of many kinds, which they can produce and which we\r\nneed.\r\n\r\nLet us say to the democracies: \"We Americans are vitally concerned in your\r\ndefense of freedom. We are putting forth our energies, our resources and\r\nour organizing powers to give you the strength to regain and maintain a\r\nfree world. We shall send you, in ever-increasing numbers, ships, planes,\r\ntanks, guns. This is our purpose and our pledge.\"\r\n\r\nIn fulfillment of this purpose we will not be intimidated by the threats of\r\ndictators that they will regard as a breach of international law or as an\r\nact of war our aid to the democracies which dare to resist their\r\naggression. Such aid is not an act of war, even if a dictator should\r\nunilaterally proclaim it so to be.\r\n\r\nWhen the dictators, if the dictators, are ready to make war upon us, they\r\nwill not wait for an act of war on our part. They did not wait for Norway\r\nor Belgium or the Netherlands to commit an act of war.\r\n\r\nTheir only interest is in a new one-way international law, which lacks\r\nmutuality in its observance, and, therefore, becomes an instrument of\r\noppression.\r\n\r\nThe happiness of future generations of Americans may well depend upon how\r\neffective and how immediate we can make our aid felt. No one can tell the\r\nexact character of the emergency situations that we may be called upon to\r\nmeet. The Nation's hands must not be tied when the Nation's life is in\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nWe must all prepare to make the sacrifices that the emergency--almost as\r\nserious as war itself--demands. Whatever stands in the way of speed and\r\nefficiency in defense preparations must give way to the national need.\r\n\r\nA free nation has the right to expect full cooperation from all groups. A\r\nfree nation has the right to look to the leaders of business, of labor, and\r\nof agriculture to take the lead in stimulating effort, not among other\r\ngroups but within their own groups.\r\n\r\nThe best way of dealing with the few slackers or trouble makers in our\r\nmidst is, first, to shame them by patriotic example, and, if that fails, to\r\nuse the sovereignty of Government to save Government.\r\n\r\nAs men do not live by bread alone, they do not fight by armaments alone.\r\nThose who man our defenses, and those behind them who build our defenses,\r\nmust have the stamina and the courage which come from unshakable belief in\r\nthe manner of life which they are defending. The mighty action that we are\r\ncalling for cannot be based on a disregard of all things worth fighting\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nThe Nation takes great satisfaction and much strength from the things which\r\nhave been done to make its people conscious of their individual stake in\r\nthe preservation of democratic life in America. Those things have toughened\r\nthe fibre of our people, have renewed their faith and strengthened their\r\ndevotion to the institutions we make ready to protect.\r\n\r\nCertainly this is no time for any of us to stop thinking about the social\r\nand economic problems which are the root cause of the social revolution\r\nwhich is today a supreme factor in the world.\r\n\r\nFor there is nothing mysterious about the foundations of a healthy and\r\nstrong democracy. The basic things expected by our people of their\r\npolitical and economic systems are simple. They are:\r\n\r\nEquality of opportunity for youth and for others.\r\n\r\nJobs for those who can work.\r\n\r\nSecurity for those who need it.\r\n\r\nThe ending of special privilege for the few.\r\n\r\nThe preservation of civil liberties for all.\r\n\r\nThe enjoyment of the fruits of scientific progress in a wider and\r\nconstantly rising standard of living.\r\n\r\nThese are the simple, basic things that must never be lost sight of in the\r\nturmoil and unbelievable complexity of our modern world. The inner and\r\nabiding strength of our economic and political systems is dependent upon\r\nthe degree to which they fulfill these expectations.\r\n\r\nMany subjects connected with our social economy call for immediate\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nAs examples:\r\n\r\nWe should bring more citizens under the coverage of old-age pensions and\r\nunemployment insurance.\r\n\r\nWe should widen the opportunities for adequate medical care.\r\n\r\nWe should plan a better system by which persons deserving or needing\r\ngainful employment may obtain it.\r\n\r\nI have called for personal sacrifice. I am assured of the willingness of\r\nalmost all Americans to respond to that call.\r\n\r\nA part of the sacrifice means the payment of more money in taxes. In my\r\nBudget Message I shall recommend that a greater portion of this great\r\ndefense program be paid for from taxation than we are paying today. No\r\nperson should try, or be allowed, to get rich out of this program; and the\r\nprinciple of tax payments in accordance with ability to pay should be\r\nconstantly before our eyes to guide our legislation.\r\n\r\nIf the Congress maintains these principles, the voters, putting patriotism\r\nahead of pocketbooks, will give you their applause.\r\n\r\nIn the future days, which we seek to make secure, we look forward to a\r\nworld founded upon four essential human freedoms.\r\n\r\nThe first is freedom of speech and expression--everywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nThe second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own\r\nway--everywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nThe third is freedom from want--which, translated into world terms, means\r\neconomic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy\r\npeacetime life for its inhabitants--everywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nThe fourth is freedom from fear--which, translated into world terms, means a\r\nworld-wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough\r\nfashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical\r\naggression against any neighbor--anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nThat is no vision of a distant millennium. It is a definite basis for a\r\nkind of world attainable in our own time and generation. That kind of world\r\nis the very antithesis of the so-called new order of tyranny which the\r\ndictators seek to create with the crash of a bomb.\r\n\r\nTo that new order we oppose the greater conception--the moral order. A good\r\nsociety is able to face schemes of world domination and foreign revolutions\r\nalike without fear.\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of our American history, we have been engaged in\r\nchange--in a perpetual peaceful revolution--a revolution which goes on\r\nsteadily, quietly adjusting itself to changing conditions--without the\r\nconcentration camp or the quick-lime in the ditch. The world order which we\r\nseek is the cooperation of free countries, working together in a friendly,\r\ncivilized society.\r\n\r\nThis nation has placed its destiny in the hands and heads and hearts of its\r\nmillions of free men and women; and its faith in freedom under the guidance\r\nof God. Freedom means the supremacy of human rights everywhere. Our support\r\ngoes to those who struggle to gain those rights or keep them. Our strength\r\nis our unity of purpose. To that high concept there can be no end save\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\r\nJanuary 6, 1942\r\n\r\nIn fulfilling my duty to report upon the State of the Union, I am proud to\r\nsay to you that the spirit of the American people was never higher than it\r\nis today--the Union was never more closely knit together--this country was\r\nnever more deeply determined to face the solemn tasks before it.\r\n\r\nThe response of the American people has been instantaneous, and it will be\r\nsustained until our security is assured.\r\n\r\nExactly one year ago today I said to this Congress: \"When the dictators. . .\r\nare ready to make war upon us, they will not wait for an act of war on\r\nour part. . . . They--not we--will choose the time and the place and the\r\nmethod of their attack.\"\r\n\r\nWe now know their choice of the time: a peaceful Sunday morning--December\r\n7, 1941.\r\n\r\nWe know their choice of the place: an American outpost in the Pacific.\r\n\r\nWe know their choice of the method: the method of Hitler himself.\r\n\r\nJapan's scheme of conquest goes back half a century. It was not merely a\r\npolicy of seeking living room: it was a plan which included the subjugation\r\nof all the peoples in the Far East and in the islands of the Pacific, and\r\nthe domination of that ocean by Japanese military and naval control of the\r\nwestern coasts of North, Central, and South America.\r\n\r\nThe development of this ambitious conspiracy was marked by the war against\r\nChina in 1894; the subsequent occupation of Korea; the war against Russia\r\nin 1904; the illegal fortification of the mandated Pacific islands\r\nfollowing 1920; the seizure of Manchuria in 1931; and the invasion of China\r\nin 1937.\r\n\r\nA similar policy of criminal conquest was adopted by Italy. The Fascists\r\nfirst revealed their imperial designs in Libya and Tripoli. In 1935 they\r\nseized Abyssinia. Their goal was the domination of all North Africa, Egypt,\r\nparts of France, and the entire Mediterranean world.\r\n\r\nBut the dreams of empire of the Japanese and Fascist leaders were modest in\r\ncomparison with the gargantuan aspirations of Hitler and his Nazis. Even\r\nbefore they came to power in 1933, their plans for that conquest had been\r\ndrawn. Those plans provided for ultimate domination, not of any one section\r\nof the world, but of the whole earth and all the oceans on it.\r\n\r\nWhen Hitler organized his Berlin-Rome-Tokyo alliance, all these plans of\r\nconquest became a single plan. Under this, in addition to her own schemes\r\nof conquest, Japan's role was obviously to cut off our supply of weapons of\r\nwar to Britain, and Russia and China--weapons which increasingly were\r\nspeeding the day of Hitler's doom. The act of Japan at Pearl Harbor was\r\nintended to stun us--to terrify us to such an extent that we would divert\r\nour industrial and military strength to the Pacific area, or even to our\r\nown continental defense.\r\n\r\nThe plan has failed in its purpose. We have not been stunned. We have not\r\nbeen terrified or confused. This very reassembling of the Seventy-seventh\r\nCongress today is proof of that; for the mood of quiet, grim resolution\r\nwhich here prevails bodes ill for those who conspired and collaborated to\r\nmurder world peace.\r\n\r\nThat mood is stronger than any mere desire for revenge. It expresses the\r\nwill of the American people to make very certain that the world will never\r\nso suffer again.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, we have been faced with hard choices. It was bitter, for\r\nexample, not to be able to relieve the heroic and historic defenders of\r\nWake Island. It was bitter for us not to be able to land a million men in a\r\nthousand ships in the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\nBut this adds only to our determination to see to it that the Stars and\r\nStripes will fly again over Wake and Guam. Yes, see to it that the brave\r\npeople of the Philippines will be rid of Japanese imperialism; and will\r\nlive in freedom, security, and independence.\r\n\r\nPowerful and offensive actions must and will be taken in proper time. The\r\nconsolidation of the United Nations' total war effort against our common\r\nenemies is being achieved.\r\n\r\nThat was and is the purpose of conferences which have been held during the\r\npast two weeks in Washington, and Moscow and Chungking. That is the primary\r\nobjective of the declaration of solidarity signed in Washington on January\r\n1, 1942, by 26 Nations united against the Axis powers.\r\n\r\nDifficult choices may have to be made in the months to come. We do not\r\nshrink from such decisions. We and those united with us will make those\r\ndecisions with courage and determination.\r\n\r\nPlans have been laid here and in the other capitals for coordinated and\r\ncooperative action by all the United Nations--military action and economic\r\naction. Already we have established, as you know, unified command of land,\r\nsea, and air forces in the southwestern Pacific theater of war. There will\r\nbe a continuation of conferences and consultations among military staffs,\r\nso that the plans and operations of each will fit into the general strategy\r\ndesigned to crush the enemy. We shall not fight isolated wars--each Nation\r\ngoing its own way. These 26 Nations are united--not in spirit and\r\ndetermination alone, but in the broad conduct of the war in all its\r\nphases.\r\n\r\nFor the first time since the Japanese and the Fascists and the Nazis\r\nstarted along their blood-stained course of conquest they now face the fact\r\nthat superior forces are assembling against them. Gone forever are the days\r\nwhen the aggressors could attack and destroy their victims one by one\r\nwithout unity of resistance. We of the United Nations will so dispose our\r\nforces that we can strike at the common enemy wherever the greatest damage\r\ncan be done him.\r\n\r\nThe militarists of Berlin and Tokyo started this war. But the massed,\r\nangered forces of common humanity will finish it.\r\n\r\nDestruction of the material and spiritual centers of civilization--this has\r\nbeen and still is the purpose of Hitler and his Italian and Japanese\r\nchessmen. They would wreck the power of the British Commonwealth and Russia\r\nand China and the Netherlands--and then combine all their forces to achieve\r\ntheir ultimate goal, the conquest of the United States.\r\n\r\nThey know that victory for us means victory for freedom.\r\n\r\nThey know that victory for us means victory for the institution of\r\ndemocracy--the ideal of the family, the simple principles of common decency\r\nand humanity.\r\n\r\nThey know that victory for us means victory for religion. And they could\r\nnot tolerate that. The world is too small to provide adequate \"living room\"\r\nfor both Hitler and God. In proof of that, the Nazis have now announced\r\ntheir plan for enforcing their new German, pagan religion all over the\r\nworld--a plan by which the Holy Bible and the Cross of Mercy would be\r\ndisplaced by Mein Kampf and the swastika and the naked sword.\r\n\r\nOur own objectives are clear; the objective of smashing the militarism\r\nimposed by war lords upon their enslaved peoples the objective of\r\nliberating the subjugated Nations--the objective of establishing and\r\nsecuring freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from want, and\r\nfreedom from fear everywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nWe shall not stop short of these objectives--nor shall we be satisfied\r\nmerely to gain them and then call it a day. I know that I speak for the\r\nAmerican people--and I have good reason to believe that I speak also for\r\nall the other peoples who fight with us--when I say that this time we are\r\ndetermined not only to win the war, but also to maintain the security of\r\nthe peace that will follow.\r\n\r\nBut we know that modern methods of warfare make it a task, not only of\r\nshooting and fighting, but an even more urgent one of working and\r\nproducing.\r\n\r\nVictory requires the actual weapons of war and the means of transporting\r\nthem to a dozen points of combat.\r\n\r\nIt will not be sufficient for us and the other United Nations to produce a\r\nslightly superior supply of munitions to that of Germany, Japan, Italy, and\r\nthe stolen industries in the countries which they have overrun.\r\n\r\nThe superiority of the United Nations in munitions and ships must be\r\noverwhelming--so overwhelming that the Axis Nations can never hope to catch\r\nup with it. And so, in order to attain this overwhelming superiority the\r\nUnited States must build planes and tanks and guns and ships to the utmost\r\nlimit of our national capacity. We have the ability and capacity to produce\r\narms not only for our own forces, but also for the armies, navies, and air\r\nforces fighting on our side.\r\n\r\nAnd our overwhelming superiority of armament must be adequate to put\r\nweapons of war at the proper time into the hands of those men in the\r\nconquered Nations who stand ready to seize the first opportunity to revolt\r\nagainst their German and Japanese oppressors, and against the traitors in\r\ntheir own ranks, known by the already infamous name of \"Quislings.\" And I\r\nthink that it is a fair prophecy to say that, as we get guns to the\r\npatriots in those lands, they too will fire shots heard 'round the world.\r\n\r\nThis production of ours in the United States must be raised far above\r\npresent levels, even though it will mean the dislocation of the lives and\r\noccupations of millions of our own people. We must raise our sights all\r\nalong the production line. Let no man say it cannot be done. It must be\r\ndone--and we have undertaken to do it.\r\n\r\nI have just sent a letter of directive to the appropriate departments and\r\nagencies of our Government, ordering that immediate steps be taken:\r\n\r\nFirst, to increase our production rate of airplanes so rapidly that in this\r\nyear, 1942, we shall produce 60,000 planes, 10,000 more than the goal that\r\nwe set a year and a half ago. This includes 45,000 combat planes--bombers,\r\ndive bombers, pursuit planes. The rate of increase will be maintained and\r\ncontinued so that next year, 1943, we shall produce 125,000 airplanes,\r\nincluding 100,000 combat planes.\r\n\r\nSecond, to increase our production rate of tanks so rapidly that in this\r\nyear, 1942, we shall produce 45,000 tanks; and to continue that increase so\r\nthat next year, 1943, we shall produce 75,000 tanks.\r\n\r\nThird, to increase our production rate of anti-aircraft guns so rapidly\r\nthat in this year, 1942, we shall produce 20,000 of them; and to continue\r\nthat increase so that next year, 1943, we shall produce 35,000\r\nanti-aircraft guns.\r\n\r\nAnd fourth, to increase our production rate of merchant ships so rapidly\r\nthat in this year, 1942, we shall build 6,000,000 deadweight tons as\r\ncompared with a 1941 completed production of 1,100,000. And finally, we\r\nshall continue that increase so that next year, 1943, we shall build\r\n10,000,000 tons of shipping.\r\n\r\nThese figures and similar figures for a multitude of other implements of\r\nwar will give the Japanese and the Nazis a little idea of just what they\r\naccomplished in the attack at Pearl Harbor.\r\n\r\nAnd I rather hope that all these figures which I have given will become\r\ncommon knowledge in Germany and Japan.\r\n\r\nOur task is hard--our task is unprecedented--and the time is short. We must\r\nstrain every existing armament-producing facility to the utmost. We must\r\nconvert every available plant and tool to war production. That goes all the\r\nway from the greatest plants to the smallest--from the huge automobile\r\nindustry to the village machine shop.\r\n\r\nProduction for war is based on men and women--the human hands and brains\r\nwhich collectively we call Labor. Our workers stand ready to work long\r\nhours; to turn out more in a day's work; to keep the wheels turning and the\r\nfires burning twenty-four hours a day, and seven days a week. They realize\r\nwell that on the speed and efficiency of their work depend the lives of\r\ntheir sons and their brothers on the fighting fronts.\r\n\r\nProduction for war is based on metals and raw materials--steel, copper,\r\nrubber, aluminum, zinc, tin. Greater and greater quantities of them will\r\nhave to be diverted to war purposes. Civilian use of them will have to be\r\ncut further and still further--and, in many cases, completely eliminated.\r\n\r\nWar costs money. So far, we have hardly even begun to pay for it. We have\r\ndevoted only 15 percent of our national income to national defense. As will\r\nappear in my Budget Message tomorrow, our war program for the coming fiscal\r\nyear will cost 56 billion dollars or, in other words, more than half of the\r\nestimated annual national income. That means taxes and bonds and bonds and\r\ntaxes. It means cutting luxuries and other non-essentials. In a word, it\r\nmeans an \"all-out\" war by individual effort and family effort in a united\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nOnly this all-out scale of production will hasten the ultimate all-out\r\nvictory. Speed will count. Lost ground can always be regained--lost time\r\nnever. Speed will save lives; speed will save this Nation which is in\r\nperil; speed will save our freedom and our civilization--and slowness has\r\nnever been an American characteristic.\r\n\r\nAs the United States goes into its full stride, we must always be on guard\r\nagainst misconceptions which will arise, some of them naturally, or which\r\nwill be planted among us by our enemies.\r\n\r\nWe must guard against complacency. We must not underrate the enemy. He is\r\npowerful and cunning--and cruel and ruthless. He will stop at nothing that\r\ngives him a chance to kill and to destroy. He has trained his people to\r\nbelieve that their highest perfection is achieved by waging war. For many\r\nyears he has prepared for this very conflict--planning, and plotting, and\r\ntraining, arming, and fighting. We have already tasted defeat. We may\r\nsuffer further setbacks. We must face the fact of a hard war, a long war, a\r\nbloody war, a costly war.\r\n\r\nWe must, on the other hand, guard against defeatism. That has been one of\r\nthe chief weapons of Hitler's propaganda machine--used time and again with\r\ndeadly results. It will not be used successfully on the American people.\r\n\r\nWe must guard against divisions among ourselves and among all the other\r\nUnited Nations. We must be particularly vigilant against racial\r\ndiscrimination in any of its ugly forms. Hitler will try again to breed\r\nmistrust and suspicion between one individual and another, one group and\r\nanother, one race and another, one Government and another. He will try to\r\nuse the same technique of falsehood and rumor-mongering with which he\r\ndivided France from Britain. He is trying to do this with us even now. But\r\nhe will find a unity of will and purpose against him, which will persevere\r\nuntil the destruction of all his black designs upon the freedom and safety\r\nof the people of the world.\r\n\r\nWe cannot wage this war in a defensive spirit. As our power and our\r\nresources are fully mobilized, we shall carry the attack against the\r\nenemy--we shall hit him and hit him again wherever and whenever we can reach\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWe must keep him far from our shores, for we intend to bring this battle to\r\nhim on his own home grounds.\r\n\r\nAmerican armed forces must be used at any place in all the world where it\r\nseems advisable to engage the forces of the enemy. In some cases these\r\noperations will be defensive, in order to protect key positions. In other\r\ncases, these operations will be offensive, in order to strike at the common\r\nenemy, with a view to his complete encirclement and eventual total defeat.\r\n\r\nAmerican armed forces will operate at many points in the Far East.\r\n\r\nAmerican armed forces will be on all the oceans--helping to guard the\r\nessential communications which are vital to the United Nations.\r\n\r\nAmerican land and air and sea forces will take stations in the British\r\nIsles--which constitute an essential fortress in this great world\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\nAmerican armed forces will help to protect this hemisphere--and also help to\r\nprotect bases outside this hemisphere, which could be used for an attack on\r\nthe Americas.\r\n\r\nIf any of our enemies, from Europe or from Asia, attempt long-range raids\r\nby \"suicide\" squadrons of bombing planes, they will do so only in the hope\r\nof terrorizing our people and disrupting our morale. Our people are not\r\nafraid of that. We know that we may have to pay a heavy price for freedom.\r\nWe will pay this price with a will. Whatever the price, it is a thousand\r\ntimes worth it. No matter what our enemies, in their desperation, may\r\nattempt to do to us--we will say, as the people of London have said, \"We\r\ncan take it.\" And what's more we can give it back and we will give it\r\nback--with compound interest.\r\n\r\nWhen our enemies challenged our country to stand up and fight, they\r\nchallenged each and every one of us. And each and every one of us has\r\naccepted the challenge--for himself and for his Nation.\r\n\r\nThere were only some 400 United States Marines who in the heroic and\r\nhistoric defense of Wake Island inflicted such great losses on the enemy.\r\nSome of those men were killed in action; and others are now prisoners of\r\nwar. When the survivors of that great fight are liberated and restored to\r\ntheir homes, they will learn that a hundred and thirty million of their\r\nfellow citizens have been inspired to render their own full share of\r\nservice and sacrifice.\r\n\r\nWe can well say that our men on the fighting fronts have already proved\r\nthat Americans today are just as rugged and just as tough as any of the\r\nheroes whose exploits we celebrate on the Fourth of July.\r\n\r\nMany people ask, \"When will this war end?\" There is only one answer to\r\nthat. It will end just as soon as we make it end, by our combined efforts,\r\nour combined strength, our combined determination to fight through and work\r\nthrough until the end--the end of militarism in Germany and Italy and\r\nJapan. Most certainly we shall not settle for less.\r\n\r\nThat is the spirit in which discussions have been conducted during the\r\nvisit of the British Prime Minister to Washington. Mr. Churchill and I\r\nunderstand each other, our motives and our purposes. Together, during the\r\npast two weeks, we have faced squarely the major military and economic\r\nproblems of this greatest world war.\r\n\r\nAll in our Nation have been cheered by Mr. Churchill's visit. We have been\r\ndeeply stirred by his great message to us. He is welcome in our midst, and\r\nwe unite in wishing him a safe return to his home.\r\n\r\nFor we are fighting on the same side with the British people, who fought\r\nalone for long, terrible months, and withstood the enemy with fortitude and\r\ntenacity and skill.\r\n\r\nWe are fighting on the same side with the Russian people who have seen the\r\nNazi hordes swarm up to the very gates of Moscow, and who with almost\r\nsuperhuman will and courage have forced the invaders back into retreat.\r\n\r\nWe are fighting on the same side as the brave people of China--those\r\nmillions who for four and a half long years have withstood bombs and\r\nstarvation and have whipped the invaders time and again in spite of the\r\nsuperior Japanese equipment and arms. Yes, we are fighting on the same side\r\nas the indomitable Dutch. We are fighting on the same side as all the other\r\nGovernments in exile, whom Hitler and all his armies and all his Gestapo\r\nhave not been able to conquer.\r\n\r\nBut we of the United Nations are not making all this sacrifice of human\r\neffort and human lives to return to the kind of world we had after the last\r\nworld war.\r\n\r\nWe are fighting today for security, for progress, and for peace, not only\r\nfor ourselves but for all men, not only for one generation but for all\r\ngenerations. We are fighting to cleanse the world of ancient evils, ancient\r\nills.\r\n\r\nOur enemies are guided by brutal cynicism, by unholy contempt for the human\r\nrace. We are inspired by a faith that goes back through all the years to\r\nthe first chapter of the Book of Genesis: \"God created man in His own\r\nimage.\"\r\n\r\nWe on our side are striving to be true to that divine heritage. We are\r\nfighting, as our fathers have fought, to uphold the doctrine that all men\r\nare equal in the sight of God. Those on the other side are striving to\r\ndestroy this deep belief and to create a world in their own image--a world\r\nof tyranny and cruelty and serfdom.\r\n\r\nThat is the conflict that day and night now pervades our lives.\r\n\r\nNo compromise can end that conflict. There never has been--there never can\r\nbe--successful compromise between good and evil. Only total victory can\r\nreward the champions of tolerance, and decency, and freedom, and faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\r\nJanuary 7, 1943\r\n\r\nMr. Vice President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Seventy-eighth Congress:\r\n\r\nThis Seventy-eighth Congress assembles in one of the great moments in the\r\nhistory of the Nation. The past year was perhaps the most crucial for\r\nmodern civilization; the coming year will be filled with violent conflicts--\r\nyet with high promise of better things.\r\n\r\nWe must appraise the events of 1942 according to their relative importance;\r\nwe must exercise a sense of proportion.\r\n\r\nFirst in importance in the American scene has been the inspiring proof of\r\nthe great qualities of our fighting men. They have demonstrated these\r\nqualities in adversity as well as in victory. As long as our flag flies\r\nover this Capitol, Americans will honor the soldiers, sailors, and marines\r\nwho fought our first battles of this war against overwhelming odds the\r\nheroes, living and dead, of Wake and Bataan and Guadalcanal, of the Java\r\nSea and Midway and the North Atlantic convoys. Their unconquerable spirit\r\nwill live forever.\r\n\r\nBy far the largest and most important developments in the whole world-wide\r\nstrategic picture of 1942 were the events of the long fronts in Russia:\r\nfirst, the implacable defense of Stalingrad; and, second, the offensives by\r\nthe Russian armies at various points that started in the latter part of\r\nNovember and which still roll on with great force and effectiveness.\r\n\r\nThe other major events of the year were: the series of Japanese advances in\r\nthe Philippines, the East Indies, Malaya, and Burma; the stopping of that\r\nJapanese advance in the mid-Pacific, the South Pacific, and the Indian\r\nOceans; the successful defense of the Near East by the British\r\ncounterattack through Egypt and Libya; the American-British occupation of\r\nNorth Africa. Of continuing importance in the year 1942 were the unending\r\nand bitterly contested battles of the convoy routes, and the gradual\r\npassing of air superiority from the Axis to the United Nations.\r\n\r\nThe Axis powers knew that they must win the war in 1942--or eventually lose\r\neverything. I do not need to tell you that our enemies did not win the war\r\nin 1942.\r\n\r\nIn the Pacific area, our most important victory in 1942 was the air and\r\nnaval battle off Midway Island. That action is historically important\r\nbecause it secured for our use communication lines stretching thousands of\r\nmiles in every direction. In placing this emphasis on the Battle of Midway,\r\nI am not unmindful of other successful actions in the Pacific, in the air\r\nand on land and afloat--especially those on the Coral Sea and New Guinea\r\nand in the Solomon Islands. But these actions were essentially defensive.\r\nThey were part of the delaying strategy that characterized this phase of\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\nDuring this period we inflicted steady losses upon the enemy--great losses\r\nof Japanese planes and naval vessels, transports and cargo ships. As early\r\nas one year ago, we set as a primary task in the war of the Pacific a\r\nday-by-day and week-by-week and month-by-month destruction of more Japanese\r\nwar materials than Japanese industry could replace. Most certainly, that\r\ntask has been and is being performed by our fighting ships and planes. And\r\na large part of this task has been accomplished by the gallant crews of our\r\nAmerican submarines who strike on the other side of the Pacific at Japanese\r\nships--right up at the very mouth of the harbor of Yokohama.\r\n\r\nWe know that as each day goes by, Japanese strength in ships and planes is\r\ngoing down and down, and American strength in ships and planes is going up\r\nand up. And so I sometimes feel that the eventual outcome can now be put on\r\na mathematical basis. That will become evident to the Japanese people\r\nthemselves when we strike at their own home islands, and bomb them\r\nconstantly from the air.\r\n\r\nAnd in the attacks against Japan, we shall be joined with the heroic people\r\nof China--that great people whose ideals of peace are so closely akin to our\r\nown. Even today we are flying as much lend-lease material into China as\r\never traversed the Burma Road, flying it over mountains 17,000 feet high,\r\nflying blind through sleet and snow. We shall overcome all the formidable\r\nobstacles, and get the battle equipment into China to shatter the power of\r\nour common enemy. From this war, China will realize the security, the\r\nprosperity and the dignity, which Japan has sought so ruthlessly to\r\ndestroy.\r\n\r\nThe period of our defensive attrition in the Pacific is drawing to a close.\r\nNow our aim is to force the Japanese to fight. Last year, we stopped them.\r\nThis year, we intend to advance.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the European theater of war, during this past year it was\r\nclear that our first task was to lessen the concentrated pressure on the\r\nRussian front by compelling Germany to divert part of her manpower and\r\nequipment to another theater of war. After months of secret planning and\r\npreparation in the utmost detail, an enormous amphibious expedition was\r\nembarked for French North Africa from the United States and the United\r\nKingdom in literally hundreds of ships. It reached its objectives with very\r\nsmall losses, and has already produced an important effect upon the whole\r\nsituation of the war. It has opened to attack what Mr. Churchill well\r\ndescribed as \"the under-belly of the Axis,\" and it has removed the always\r\ndangerous threat of an Axis attack through West Africa against the South\r\nAtlantic Ocean and the continent of South America itself.\r\n\r\nThe well-timed and splendidly executed offensive from Egypt by the British\r\nEighth Army was a part of the same major strategy of the United Nations.\r\n\r\nGreat rains and appalling mud and very limited communications have delayed\r\nthe final battles of Tunisia. The Axis is reinforcing its strong positions.\r\nBut I am confident that though the fighting will be tough, when the final\r\nAllied assault is made, the last vestige of Axis power will be driven from\r\nthe whole of the south shores of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nAny review of the year 1942 must emphasize the magnitude and the diversity\r\nof the military activities in which this Nation has become engaged. As I\r\nspeak to you, approximately one and a half million of our soldiers,\r\nsailors, marines, and fliers are in service outside of our continental\r\nlimits, all through the world. Our merchant seamen, in addition, are\r\ncarrying supplies to them and to our allies over every sea lane.\r\n\r\nFew Americans realize the amazing growth of our air strength, though I am\r\nsure our enemy does. Day in and day out our forces are bombing the enemy\r\nand meeting him in combat on many different fronts in every part of the\r\nworld. And for those who question the quality of our aircraft and the\r\nability of our fliers, I point to the fact that, in Africa, we are shooting\r\ndown two enemy planes to every one we lose, and in the Pacific and the\r\nSouthwest Pacific we are shooting them down four to one.\r\n\r\nWe pay great tribute--the tribute of the United States of America--to the\r\nfighting men of Russia and China and Britain and the various members of the\r\nBritish Commonwealth--the millions of men who through the years of this war\r\nhave fought our common enemies, and have denied to them the world conquest\r\nwhich they sought.\r\n\r\nWe pay tribute to the soldiers and fliers and seamen of others of the\r\nUnited Nations whose countries have been overrun by Axis hordes.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the Allied occupation of North Africa, powerful units of the\r\nFrench Army and Navy are going into action. They are in action with the\r\nUnited Nations forces. We welcome them as allies and as friends. They join\r\nwith those Frenchmen who, since the dark days of June, 1940, have been\r\nfighting valiantly for the liberation of their stricken country.\r\n\r\nWe pay tribute to the fighting leaders of our allies, to Winston Churchill,\r\nto Joseph Stalin, and to the Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. Yes, there is a\r\nvery great unanimity between the leaders of the United Nations. This unity\r\nis effective in planning and carrying out the major strategy of this war\r\nand in building up and in maintaining the lines of supplies.\r\n\r\nI cannot prophesy. I cannot tell you when or where the United Nations are\r\ngoing to strike next in Europe. But we are going to strike--and strike\r\nhard. I cannot tell you whether we are going to hit them in Norway, or\r\nthrough the Low Countries, or in France, or through Sardinia or Sicily, or\r\nthrough the Balkans, or through Poland--or at several points\r\nsimultaneously. But I can tell you that no matter where and when we strike\r\nby land, we and the British and the Russians will hit them from the air\r\nheavily and relentlessly. Day in and day out we shall heap tons upon tons\r\nof high explosives on their war factories and utilities and seaports.\r\n\r\nHitler and Mussolini will understand now the enormity of their\r\nmiscalculations--that the Nazis would always have the advantage of superior\r\nair power as they did when they bombed Warsaw, and Rotterdam, and London\r\nand Coventry. That superiority has gone--forever.\r\n\r\nYes, the Nazis and the Fascists have asked for it--and they are going to get\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOur forward progress in this war has depended upon our progress on the\r\nproduction front.\r\n\r\nThere has been criticism of the management and conduct of our war\r\nproduction. Much of this self-criticism has had a healthy effect. It has\r\nspurred us on. It has reflected a normal American impatience to get on with\r\nthe job. We are the kind of people who are never quite satisfied with\r\nanything short of miracles.\r\n\r\nBut there has been some criticism based on guesswork and even on malicious\r\nfalsification of fact. Such criticism creates doubts and creates fears, and\r\nweakens our total effort.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to suggest that we should be completely satisfied with our\r\nproduction progress today, or next month, or ever. But I can report to you\r\nwith genuine pride on what has been accomplished in 1942.\r\n\r\nA year ago we set certain production goals for 1942 and for 1943. Some\r\npeople, including some experts, thought that we had pulled some big figures\r\nout of a hat just to frighten the Axis. But we had confidence in the\r\nability of our people to establish new records. And that confidence has\r\nbeen justified.\r\n\r\nOf course, we realized that some production objectives would have to be\r\nchanged--some of them adjusted upward, and others downward; some items\r\nwould be taken out of the program altogether, and others added. This was\r\ninevitable as we gained battle experience, and as technological\r\nimprovements were made.\r\n\r\nOur 1942 airplane production and tank production fell short,\r\nnumerically--stress the word numerically of the goals set a year ago.\r\nNevertheless, we have plenty of reason to be proud of our record for 1942.\r\nWe produced 48,000 military planes--more than the airplane production of\r\nGermany, Italy, and Japan put together. Last month, in December, we\r\nproduced 5,500 military planes and the rate is rapidly rising. Furthermore,\r\nwe must remember that as each month passes by, the averages of our types\r\nweigh more, take more man-hours to make, and have more striking power.\r\n\r\nIn tank production, we revised our schedule--and for good and sufficient\r\nreasons. As a result of hard experience in battle, we have diverted a\r\nportion of our tank-producing capacity to a stepped-up production of new,\r\ndeadly field weapons, especially self-propelled artillery.\r\n\r\nHere are some other production figures:\r\n\r\nIn 1942, we produced 56,000 combat vehicles, such as tanks and\r\nself-propelled artillery.\r\n\r\nIn 1942, we produced 670,000 machine guns, six times greater than our\r\nproduction in 1941 and three times greater than our total production during\r\nthe year and a half of our participation in the first World War.\r\n\r\nWe produced 21,000 anti-tank guns, six times greater than our 1941\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nWe produced ten and a quarter billion rounds of small-arms ammunition, five\r\ntimes greater than our 1941 production and three times greater than our\r\ntotal production in the first World War.\r\n\r\nWe produced 181 million rounds of artillery ammunition, twelve times\r\ngreater than our 1941 production and ten times greater than our total\r\nproduction in the first World War.\r\n\r\nI think the arsenal of democracy is making good.\r\n\r\nThese facts and figures that I have given will give no great aid and\r\ncomfort to the enemy. On the contrary, I can imagine that they will give\r\nhim considerable discomfort. I suspect that Hitler and Tojo will find it\r\ndifficult to explain to the German and Japanese people just why it is that\r\n\"decadent, inefficient democracy\" can produce such phenomenal quantities of\r\nweapons and munitions--and fighting men.\r\n\r\nWe have given the lie to certain misconceptions--which is an extremely\r\npolite word--especially the one which holds that the various blocs or\r\ngroups within a free country cannot forego their political and economic\r\ndifferences in time of crisis and work together toward a common goal.\r\n\r\nWhile we have been achieving this miracle of production, during the past\r\nyear our armed forces have grown from a little over 2,000,000 to 7,000,000.\r\nIn other words, we have withdrawn from the labor force and the farms some\r\n5,000,000 of our younger workers. And in spite of this, our farmers have\r\ncontributed their share to the common effort by producing the greatest\r\nquantity of food ever made available during a single year in all our\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nI wonder is there any person among us so simple as to believe that all this\r\ncould have been done without creating some dislocations in our normal\r\nnational life, some inconveniences, and even some hardships?\r\n\r\nWho can have hoped to have done this without burdensome Government\r\nregulations which are a nuisance to everyone--including those who have the\r\nthankless task of administering them?\r\n\r\nWe all know that there have been mistakes--mistakes due to the inevitable\r\nprocess of trial and error inherent in doing big things for the first time.\r\nWe all know that there have been too many complicated forms and\r\nquestionnaires. I know about that. I have had to fill some of them out\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nBut we are determined to see to it that our supplies of food and other\r\nessential civilian goods are distributed on a fair and just basis--to rich\r\nand poor, management and labor, farmer and city dweller alike. We are\r\ndetermined to keep the cost of living at a stable level. All this has\r\nrequired much information. These forms and questionnaires represent an\r\nhonest and sincere attempt by honest and sincere officials to obtain this\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nWe have learned by the mistakes that we have made.\r\n\r\nOur experience will enable us during the coming year to improve the\r\nnecessary mechanisms of wartime economic controls, and to simplify\r\nadministrative procedures. But we do not intend to leave things so lax that\r\nloopholes will be left for cheaters, for chiselers, or for the manipulators\r\nof the black market.\r\n\r\nOf course, there have been disturbances and inconveniences--and even\r\nhardships. And there will be many, many more before we finally win. Yes,\r\n1943 will not be an easy year for us on the home front. We shall feel in\r\nmany ways in our daily lives the sharp pinch of total war.\r\n\r\nFortunately, there are only a few Americans who place appetite above\r\npatriotism. The overwhelming majority realize that the food we send abroad\r\nis for essential military purposes, for our own and Allied fighting forces,\r\nand for necessary help in areas that we occupy.\r\n\r\nWe Americans intend to do this great job together. In our common labors we\r\nmust build and fortify the very foundation of national unity--confidence in\r\none another.\r\n\r\nIt is often amusing, and it is sometimes politically profitable, to picture\r\nthe City of Washington as a madhouse, with the Congress and the\r\nAdministration disrupted with confusion and indecision and general\r\nincompetence.\r\n\r\nHowever--what matters most in war is results. And the one pertinent fact is\r\nthat after only a few years of preparation and only one year of warfare, we\r\nare able to engage, spiritually as well as physically, in the total waging\r\nof a total war.\r\n\r\nWashington may be a madhouse--but only in the sense that it is the Capital\r\nCity of a Nation which is fighting mad. And I think that Berlin and Rome\r\nand Tokyo, which had such contempt for the obsolete methods of democracy,\r\nwould now gladly use all they could get of that same brand of madness.\r\n\r\nAnd we must not forget that our achievements in production have been\r\nrelatively no greater than those of the Russians and the British and the\r\nChinese who have developed their own war industries under the incredible\r\ndifficulties of battle conditions. They have had to continue work through\r\nbombings and blackouts. And they have never quit.\r\n\r\nWe Americans are in good, brave company in this war, and we are playing our\r\nown, honorable part in the vast common effort.\r\n\r\nAs spokesmen for the United States Government, you and I take off our hats\r\nto those responsible for our American production--to the owners, managers,\r\nand supervisors, to the draftsmen and the engineers, and to the workers--\r\nmen and women--in factories and arsenals and shipyards and mines and mills\r\nand forests--and railroads and on highways.\r\n\r\nWe take off our hats to the farmers who have faced an unprecedented task of\r\nfeeding not only a great Nation but a great part of the world.\r\n\r\nWe take off our hats to all the loyal, anonymous, untiring men and women\r\nwho have worked in private employment and in Government and who have\r\nendured rationing and other stringencies with good humor and good will.\r\n\r\nYes, we take off our hats to all Americans who have contributed so\r\nmagnificently to our common cause.\r\n\r\nI have sought to emphasize a sense of proportion in this review of the\r\nevents of the war and the needs of the war.\r\n\r\nWe should never forget the things we are fighting for. But, at this\r\ncritical period of the war, we should confine ourselves to the larger\r\nobjectives and not get bogged down in argument over methods and details.\r\n\r\nWe, and all the United Nations, want a decent peace and a durable peace. In\r\nthe years between the end of the first World War and the beginning of the\r\nsecond World War, we were not living under a decent or a durable peace.\r\n\r\nI have reason to know that our boys at the front are concerned with two\r\nbroad aims beyond the winning of the war; and their thinking and their\r\nopinion coincide with what most Americans here back home are mulling over.\r\nThey know, and we know, that it would be inconceivable--it would, indeed, be\r\nsacrilegious--if this Nation and the world did not attain some real,\r\nlasting good out of all these efforts and sufferings and bloodshed and\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe men in our armed forces want a lasting peace, and, equally, they want\r\npermanent employment for themselves, their families, and their neighbors\r\nwhen they are mustered out at the end of the war.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago I spoke in my Annual Message of four freedoms. The blessings\r\nof two of them--freedom of speech and freedom of religion--are an essential\r\npart of the very life of this Nation; and we hope that these blessings will\r\nbe granted to all men everywhere.\r\n\r\n'The people at home, and the people at the front, are wondering a little\r\nabout the third freedom--freedom from want. To them it means that when they\r\nare mustered out, when war production is converted to the economy of peace,\r\nthey will have the right to expect full employment--full employment for\r\nthemselves and for all able-bodied men and women in America who want to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThey expect the opportunity to work, to run their farms, their stores, to\r\nearn decent wages. They are eager to face the risks inherent in our system\r\nof free enterprise.\r\n\r\nThey do not want a postwar America which suffers from undernourishment or\r\nslums--or the dole. They want no get-rich-quick era of bogus \"prosperity\"\r\nwhich will end for them in selling apples on a street corner, as happened\r\nafter the bursting of the boom in 1929.\r\n\r\nWhen you talk with our young men and our young women, you will find they\r\nwant to work for themselves and for their families; they consider that they\r\nhave the right to work; and they know that after the last war their fathers\r\ndid not gain that right.\r\n\r\nWhen you talk with our young men and women, you will find that with the\r\nopportunity for employment they want assurance against the evils of all\r\nmajor economic hazards--assurance that will extend from the cradle to the\r\ngrave. And this great Government can and must provide this assurance.\r\n\r\nI have been told that this is no time to speak of a better America after\r\nthe war. I am told it is a grave error on my part.\r\n\r\nI dissent.\r\n\r\nAnd if the security of the individual citizen, or the family, should become\r\na subject of national debate, the country knows where I stand.\r\n\r\nI say this now to this Seventy-eighth Congress, because it is wholly\r\npossible that freedom from want--the right of employment, the right of\r\nassurance against life's hazards--will loom very large as a task of America\r\nduring the coming two years.\r\n\r\nI trust it will not be regarded as an issue--but rather as a task for all of\r\nus to study sympathetically, to work out with a constant regard for the\r\nattainment of the objective, with fairness to all and with injustice to\r\nnone.\r\n\r\nIn this war of survival we must keep before our minds not only the evil\r\nthings we fight against but the good things we are fighting for. We fight\r\nto retain a great past--and we fight to gain a greater future.\r\n\r\nLet us remember, too, that economic safety for the America of the future is\r\nthreatened unless a greater economic stability comes to the rest of the\r\nworld. We cannot make America an island in either a military or an economic\r\nsense. Hitlerism, like any other form of crime or disease, can grow from\r\nthe evil seeds of economic as well as military feudalism.\r\n\r\nVictory in this war is the first and greatest goal before us. Victory in\r\nthe peace is the next. That means striving toward the enlargement of the\r\nsecurity of man here and throughout the world--and, finally, striving for\r\nthe fourth freedom--freedom from fear.\r\n\r\nIt is of little account for any of us to talk of essential human needs, of\r\nattaining security, if we run the risk of another World War in ten or\r\ntwenty or fifty years. That is just plain common sense. Wars grow in size,\r\nin death and destruction, and in the inevitability of engulfing all\r\nNations, in inverse ratio to the shrinking size of the world as a result of\r\nthe conquest of the air. I shudder to think of what will happen to\r\nhumanity, including ourselves, if this war ends in an inconclusive peace,\r\nand another war breaks out when the babies of today have grown to fighting\r\nage.\r\n\r\nEvery normal American prays that neither he nor his sons nor his grandsons\r\nwill be compelled to go through this horror again.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly a few Americans, even now, think that this Nation can end this\r\nwar comfortably and then climb back into an American hole and pull the hole\r\nin after them.\r\n\r\nBut we have learned that we can never dig a hole so deep that it would be\r\nsafe against predatory animals. We have also learned that if we do not pull\r\nthe fangs of the predatory animals of this world, they will multiply and\r\ngrow in strength--and they will be at our throats again once more in a\r\nshort generation.\r\n\r\nMost Americans realize more clearly than ever before that modern war\r\nequipment in the hands of aggressor Nations can bring danger overnight to\r\nour own national existence or to that of any other Nation--or island--or\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nIt is clear to us that if Germany and Italy and Japan--or any one of them--\r\nremain armed at the end of this war, or are permitted to rearm, they will\r\nagain, and inevitably, embark upon an ambitious career of world conquest.\r\nThey must be disarmed and kept disarmed, and they must abandon the\r\nphilosophy, and the teaching of that philosophy, which has brought so much\r\nsuffering to the world.\r\n\r\nAfter the first World War we tried to achieve a formula for permanent\r\npeace, based on a magnificent idealism. We failed. But, by our failure, we\r\nhave learned that we cannot maintain peace at this stage of human\r\ndevelopment by good intentions alone.\r\n\r\nToday the United Nations are the mightiest military coalition in all\r\nhistory. They represent an overwhelming majority of the population of the\r\nworld. Bound together in solemn agreement that they themselves will not\r\ncommit acts of aggression or conquest against any of their neighbors, the\r\nUnited Nations can and must remain united for the maintenance of peace by\r\npreventing any attempt to rearm in Germany, in Japan, in Italy, or in any\r\nother Nation which seeks to violate the Tenth Commandment--\"Thou shalt not\r\ncovet.\"\r\n\r\nThere are cynics, there are skeptics who say it cannot be done. The\r\nAmerican people and all the freedom-loving peoples of this earth are now\r\ndemanding that it must be done. And the will of these people shall\r\nprevail.\r\n\r\nThe very philosophy of the Axis powers is based on a profound contempt for\r\nthe human race. If, in the formation of our future policy, we were guided\r\nby the same cynical contempt, then we should be surrendering to the\r\nphilosophy of our enemies, and our victory would turn to defeat.\r\n\r\nThe issue of this war is the basic issue between those who believe in\r\nmankind and those who do not--the ancient issue between those who put their\r\nfaith in the people and those who put their faith in dictators and tyrants.\r\nThere have always been those who did not believe in the people, who\r\nattempted to block their forward movement across history, to force them\r\nback to servility and suffering and silence.\r\n\r\nThe people have now gathered their strength. They are moving forward in\r\ntheir might and power--and no force, no combination of forces, no trickery,\r\ndeceit, or violence, can stop them now. They see before them the hope of\r\nthe world--a decent, secure, peaceful life for men everywhere.\r\n\r\nI do not prophesy when this war will end.\r\n\r\nBut I do believe that this year of 1943 will give to the United Nations a\r\nvery substantial advance along the roads that lead to Berlin and Rome and\r\nTokyo.\r\n\r\nI tell you it is within the realm of possibility that this Seventy-eighth\r\nCongress may have the historic privilege of helping greatly to save the\r\nworld from future fear.\r\n\r\nTherefore, let us all have confidence, let us redouble our efforts.\r\n\r\nA tremendous, costly, long-enduring task in peace as well as in war is\r\nstill ahead of us.\r\n\r\nBut, as we face that continuing task, we may know that the state of this\r\nNation is good--the heart of this Nation is sound--the spirit of this Nation\r\nis strong--the faith of this Nation is eternal.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\r\nJanuary 11, 1944\r\n\r\nTo the Congress:\r\n\r\nThis Nation in the past two years has become an active partner in the\r\nworld's greatest war against human slavery.\r\n\r\nWe have joined with like-minded people in order to defend ourselves in a\r\nworld that has been gravely threatened with gangster rule.\r\n\r\nBut I do not think that any of us Americans can be content with mere\r\nsurvival. Sacrifices that we and our allies are making impose upon us all a\r\nsacred obligation to see to it that out of this war we and our children\r\nwill gain something better than mere survival.\r\n\r\nWe are united in determination that this war shall not be followed by\r\nanother interim which leads to new disaster--that we shall not repeat the\r\ntragic errors of ostrich isolationism--that we shall not repeat the excesses\r\nof the wild twenties when this Nation went for a joy ride on a roller\r\ncoaster which ended in a tragic crash.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Hull went to Moscow in October, and when I went to Cairo and\r\nTeheran in November, we knew that we were in agreement with our allies in\r\nour common determination to fight and win this war. But there were many\r\nvital questions concerning the future peace, and they were discussed in an\r\natmosphere of complete candor and harmony.\r\n\r\nIn the last war such discussions, such meetings, did not even begin until\r\nthe shooting had stopped and the delegates began to assemble at the peace\r\ntable. There had been no previous opportunities for man-to-man discussions\r\nwhich lead to meetings of minds. The result was a peace which was not a\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nThat was a mistake which we are not repeating in this war.\r\n\r\nAnd right here I want to address a word or two to some suspicious souls who\r\nare fearful that Mr. Hull or I have made \"commitments\" for the future which\r\nmight pledge this Nation to secret treaties, or to enacting the role of\r\nSanta Claus.\r\n\r\nTo such suspicious souls--using a polite terminology--I wish to say that Mr.\r\nChurchill, and Marshal Stalin, and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek are all\r\nthoroughly conversant with the provisions of our Constitution. And so is\r\nMr. Hull. And so am I.\r\n\r\nOf course we made some commitments. We most certainly committed ourselves\r\nto very large and very specific military plans which require the use of all\r\nAllied forces to bring about the defeat of our enemies at the earliest\r\npossible time.\r\n\r\nBut there were no secret treaties or political or financial commitments.\r\n\r\nThe one supreme objective for the future, which we discussed for each\r\nNation individually, and for all the United Nations, can be summed up in\r\none word: Security.\r\n\r\nAnd that means not only physical security which provides safety from\r\nattacks by aggressors. It means also economic security, social security,\r\nmoral security--in a family of Nations.\r\n\r\nIn the plain down-to-earth talks that I had with the Generalissimo and\r\nMarshal Stalin and Prime Minister Churchill, it was abundantly clear that\r\nthey are all most deeply interested in the resumption of peaceful progress\r\nby their own peoples--progress toward a better life. All our allies want\r\nfreedom to develop their lands and resources, to build up industry, to\r\nincrease education and individual opportunity, and to raise standards of\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nAll our allies have learned by bitter experience that real development will\r\nnot be possible if they are to be diverted from their purpose by repeated\r\nwars--or even threats of war.\r\n\r\nChina and Russia are truly united with Britain and America in recognition\r\nof this essential fact:\r\n\r\nThe best interests of each Nation, large and small, demand that all\r\nfreedom-loving Nations shall join together in a just and durable system of\r\npeace. In the present world situation, evidenced by the actions of Germany,\r\nItaly, and Japan, unquestioned military control over disturbers of the\r\npeace is as necessary among Nations as it is among citizens in a community.\r\nAnd an equally basic essential to peace is a decent standard of living for\r\nall individual men and women and children in all Nations. Freedom from fear\r\nis eternally linked with freedom from want.\r\n\r\nThere are people who burrow through our Nation like unseeing moles, and\r\nattempt to spread the suspicion that if other Nations are encouraged to\r\nraise their standards of living, our own American standard of living must\r\nof necessity be depressed.\r\n\r\nThe fact is the very contrary. It has been shown time and again that if the\r\nstandard of living of any country goes up, so does its purchasing power--\r\nand that such a rise encourages a better standard of living in neighboring\r\ncountries with whom it trades. That is just plain common sense--and it is\r\nthe kind of plain common sense that provided the basis for our discussions\r\nat Moscow, Cairo, and Teheran.\r\n\r\nReturning from my journeyings, I must confess to a sense of \"let-down\" when\r\nI found many evidences of faulty perspective here in Washington. The faulty\r\nperspective consists in overemphasizing lesser problems and thereby\r\nunderemphasizing the first and greatest problem.\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming majority of our people have met the demands of this war\r\nwith magnificent courage and understanding. They have accepted\r\ninconveniences; they have accepted hardships; they have accepted tragic\r\nsacrifices. And they are ready and eager to make whatever further\r\ncontributions are needed to win the war as quickly as possible--if only\r\nthey are given the chance to know what is required of them.\r\n\r\nHowever, while the majority goes on about its great work without complaint,\r\na noisy minority maintains an uproar of demands for special favors for\r\nspecial groups. There are pests who swarm through the lobbies of the\r\nCongress and the cocktail bars of Washington, representing these special\r\ngroups as opposed to the basic interests of the Nation as a whole. They\r\nhave come to look upon the war primarily as a chance to make profits for\r\nthemselves at the expense of their neighbors--profits in money or in terms\r\nof political or social preferment.\r\n\r\nSuch selfish agitation can be highly dangerous in wartime. It creates\r\nconfusion. It damages morale. It hampers our national effort. It muddies\r\nthe waters and therefore prolongs the war.\r\n\r\nIf we analyze American history impartially, we cannot escape the fact that\r\nin our past we have not always forgotten individual and selfish and\r\npartisan interests in time of war--we have not always been united in purpose\r\nand direction. We cannot overlook the serious dissensions and the lack of\r\nunity in our war of the Revolution, in our War of 1812, or in our War\r\nBetween the States, when the survival of the Union itself was at stake.\r\n\r\nIn the first World War we came closer to national unity than in any\r\nprevious war. But that war lasted only a year and a half, and increasing\r\nsigns of disunity began to appear during the final months of the conflict.\r\n\r\nIn this war, we have been compelled to learn how interdependent upon each\r\nother are all groups and sections of the population of America.\r\n\r\nIncreased food costs, for example, will bring new demands for wage\r\nincreases from all war workers, which will in turn raise all prices of all\r\nthings including those things which the farmers themselves have to buy.\r\nIncreased wages or prices will each in turn produce the same results. They\r\nall have a particularly disastrous result on all fixed income groups.\r\n\r\nAnd I hope you will remember that all of us in this Government represent\r\nthe fixed income group just as much as we represent business owners,\r\nworkers, and farmers. This group of fixed income people includes: teachers,\r\nclergy, policemen, firemen, widows and minors on fixed incomes, wives and\r\ndependents of our soldiers and sailors, and old-age pensioners. They and\r\ntheir families add up to one-quarter of our one hundred and thirty million\r\npeople. They have few or no high pressure representatives at the Capitol.\r\nIn a period of gross inflation they would be the worst sufferers.\r\n\r\nIf ever there was a time to subordinate individual or group selfishness to\r\nthe national good, that time is now. Disunity at home--bickerings,\r\nself-seeking partisanship, stoppages of work, inflation, business as usual,\r\npolitics as usual, luxury as usual these are the influences which can\r\nundermine the morale of the brave men ready to die at the front for us\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nThose who are doing most of the complaining are not deliberately striving\r\nto sabotage the national war effort. They are laboring under the delusion\r\nthat the time is past when we must make prodigious sacrifices--that the war\r\nis already won and we can begin to slacken off. But the dangerous folly of\r\nthat point of view can be measured by the distance that separates our\r\ntroops from their ultimate objectives in Berlin and Tokyo--and by the sum of\r\nall the perils that lie along the way.\r\n\r\nOverconfidence and complacency are among our deadliest enemies. Last\r\nspring--after notable victories at Stalingrad and in Tunisia and against the\r\nU-boats on the high seas--overconfidence became so pronounced that war\r\nproduction fell off. In two months, June and July, 1943, more than a\r\nthousand airplanes that could have been made and should have been made were\r\nnot made. Those who failed to make them were not on strike. They were\r\nmerely saying, \"The war's in the bag--so let's relax.\"\r\n\r\nThat attitude on the part of anyone--Government or management or labor--can\r\nlengthen this war. It can kill American boys.\r\n\r\nLet us remember the lessons of 1918. In the summer of that year the tide\r\nturned in favor of the allies. But this Government did not relax. In fact,\r\nour national effort was stepped up. In August, 1918, the draft age limits\r\nwere broadened from 21-31 to 18-45. The President called for \"force to the\r\nutmost,\" and his call was heeded. And in November, only three months later,\r\nGermany surrendered.\r\n\r\nThat is the way to fight and win a war--all out--and not with half-an-eye on\r\nthe battlefronts abroad and the other eye-and-a-half on personal, selfish,\r\nor political interests here at home.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in order to concentrate all our energies and resources on\r\nwinning the war, and to maintain a fair and stable economy at home, I\r\nrecommend that the Congress adopt:\r\n\r\n(1) A realistic tax law--which will tax all unreasonable profits, both\r\nindividual and corporate, and reduce the ultimate cost of the war to our\r\nsons and daughters. The tax bill now under consideration by the Congress\r\ndoes not begin to meet this test.\r\n\r\n(2) A continuation of the law for the renegotiation of war contracts--which\r\nwill prevent exorbitant profits and assure fair prices to the Government.\r\nFor two long years I have pleaded with the Congress to take undue profits\r\nout of war.\r\n\r\n(3) A cost of food law--which will enable the Government (a) to place a\r\nreasonable floor under the prices the farmer may expect for his production;\r\nand (b) to place a ceiling on the prices a consumer will have to pay for\r\nthe food he buys. This should apply to necessities only; and will require\r\npublic funds to carry out. It will cost in appropriations about one percent\r\nof the present annual cost of the war.\r\n\r\n(4) Early reenactment of the stabilization statute of October, 1942. This\r\nexpires June 30, 1944, and if it is not extended well in advance, the\r\ncountry might just as well expect price chaos by summer.\r\n\r\nWe cannot have stabilization by wishful thinking. We must take positive\r\naction to maintain the integrity of the American dollar.\r\n\r\n(5) A national service law--which, for the duration of the war, will\r\nprevent strikes, and, with certain appropriate exceptions, will make\r\navailable for war production or for any other essential services every\r\nable-bodied adult in this Nation.\r\n\r\nThese five measures together form a just and equitable whole. I would not\r\nrecommend a national service law unless the other laws were passed to keep\r\ndown the cost of living, to share equitably the burdens of taxation, to\r\nhold the stabilization line, and to prevent undue profits.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Government already has the basic power to draft capital and\r\nproperty of all kinds for war purposes on a basis of just compensation.\r\n\r\nAs you know, I have for three years hesitated to recommend a national\r\nservice act. Today, however, I am convinced of its necessity. Although I\r\nbelieve that we and our allies can win the war without such a measure, I am\r\ncertain that nothing less than total mobilization of all our resources of\r\nmanpower and capital will guarantee an earlier victory, and reduce the toll\r\nof suffering and sorrow and blood.\r\n\r\nI have received a joint recommendation for this law from the heads of the\r\nWar Department, the Navy Department, and the Maritime Commission. These are\r\nthe men who bear responsibility for the procurement of the necessary arms\r\nand equipment, and for the successful prosecution of the war in the field.\r\nThey say:\r\n\r\n\"When the very life of the Nation is in peril the responsibility for\r\nservice is common to all men and women. In such a time there can be no\r\ndiscrimination between the men and women who are assigned by the Government\r\nto its defense at the battlefront and the men and women assigned to\r\nproducing the vital materials essential to successful military operations.\r\nA prompt enactment of a National Service Law would be merely an expression\r\nof the universality of this responsibility.\"\r\n\r\nI believe the country will agree that those statements are the solemn\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nNational service is the most democratic way to wage a war. Like selective\r\nservice for the armed forces, it rests on the obligation of each citizen to\r\nserve his Nation to his utmost where he is best qualified.\r\n\r\nIt does not mean reduction in wages. It does not mean loss of retirement\r\nand seniority rights and benefits. It does not mean that any substantial\r\nnumbers of war workers will be disturbed in their present jobs. Let these\r\nfacts be wholly clear.\r\n\r\nExperience in other democratic Nations at war--Britain, Canada, Australia,\r\nand New Zealand--has shown that the very existence of national service\r\nmakes unnecessary the widespread use of compulsory power. National service\r\nhas proven to be a unifying moral force based on an equal and comprehensive\r\nlegal obligation of all people in a Nation at war.\r\n\r\nThere are millions of American men and women who are not in this war at\r\nall. It is not because they do not want to be in it. But they want to know\r\nwhere they can best do their share. National service provides that\r\ndirection. It will be a means by which every man and woman can find that\r\ninner satisfaction which comes from making the fullest possible\r\ncontribution to victory.\r\n\r\nI know that all civilian war workers will be glad to be able to say many\r\nyears hence to their grandchildren: \"Yes, I, too, was in service in the\r\ngreat war. I was on duty in an airplane factory, and I helped make hundreds\r\nof fighting planes. The Government told me that in doing that I was\r\nperforming my most useful work in the service of my country.\"\r\n\r\nIt is argued that we have passed the stage in the war where national\r\nservice is necessary. But our soldiers and sailors know that this is not\r\ntrue. We are going forward on a long, rough road--and, in all journeys, the\r\nlast miles are the hardest. And it is for that final effort--for the total\r\ndefeat of our enemies--that we must mobilize our total resources. The\r\nnational war program calls for the employment of more people in 1944 than\r\nin 1943.\r\n\r\nIt is my conviction that the American people will welcome this win-the-war\r\nmeasure which is based on the eternally just principle of \"fair for one,\r\nfair for all.\"\r\n\r\nIt will give our people at home the assurance that they are standing\r\nfour-square behind our soldiers and sailors. And it will give our enemies\r\ndemoralizing assurance that we mean business--that we, 130,000,000\r\nAmericans, are on the march to Rome, Berlin, and Tokyo.\r\n\r\nI hope that the Congress will recognize that, although this is a political\r\nyear, national service is an issue which transcends politics. Great power\r\nmust be used for great purposes.\r\n\r\nAs to the machinery for this measure, the Congress itself should determine\r\nits nature--but it should be wholly nonpartisan in its make-up.\r\n\r\nOur armed forces are valiantly fulfilling their responsibilities to our\r\ncountry and our people. Now the Congress faces the responsibility for\r\ntaking those measures which are essential to national security in this the\r\nmost decisive phase of the Nation's greatest war.\r\n\r\nSeveral alleged reasons have prevented the enactment of legislation which\r\nwould preserve for our soldiers and sailors and marines the fundamental\r\nprerogative of citizenship--the right to vote. No amount of legalistic\r\nargument can becloud this issue in the eyes of these ten million American\r\ncitizens. Surely the signers of the Constitution did not intend a document\r\nwhich, even in wartime, would be construed to take away the franchise of\r\nany of those who are fighting to preserve the Constitution itself.\r\n\r\nOur soldiers and sailors and marines know that the overwhelming majority of\r\nthem will be deprived of the opportunity to vote, if the voting machinery\r\nis left exclusively to the States under existing State laws--and that there\r\nis no likelihood of these laws being changed in time to enable them to vote\r\nat the next election. The Army and Navy have reported that it will be\r\nimpossible effectively to administer forty-eight different soldier voting\r\nlaws. It is the duty of the Congress to remove this unjustifiable\r\ndiscrimination against the men and women in our armed forces--and to do it\r\nas quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nIt is our duty now to begin to lay the plans and determine the strategy for\r\nthe winning of a lasting peace and the establishment of an American\r\nstandard of living higher than ever before known. We cannot be content, no\r\nmatter how high that general standard of living may be, if some fraction of\r\nour people--whether it be one-third or one-fifth or one-tenth--is ill-fed,\r\nill-clothed, ill housed, and insecure.\r\n\r\nThis Republic had its beginning, and grew to its present strength, under\r\nthe protection of certain inalienable political rights--among them the right\r\nof free speech, free press, free worship, trial by jury, freedom from\r\nunreasonable searches and seizures. They were our rights to life and\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nAs our Nation has grown in size and stature, however--as our industrial\r\neconomy expanded--these political rights proved inadequate to assure us\r\nequality in the pursuit of happiness.\r\n\r\nWe have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual\r\nfreedom cannot exist without economic security and independence.\r\n\"Necessitous men are not free men.\" People who are hungry and out of a job\r\nare the stuff of which dictatorships are made.\r\n\r\nIn our day these economic truths have become accepted as self-evident. We\r\nhave accepted, so to speak, a second Bill of Rights under which a new basis\r\nof security and prosperity can be established for all regardless of\r\nstation, race, or creed.\r\n\r\nAmong these are:\r\n\r\nThe right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or\r\nfarms or mines of the Nation;\r\n\r\nThe right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and\r\nrecreation;\r\n\r\nThe right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which\r\nwill give him and his family a decent living;\r\n\r\nThe right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere\r\nof freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or\r\nabroad;\r\n\r\nThe right of every family to a decent home;\r\n\r\nThe right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy\r\ngood health;\r\n\r\nThe right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age,\r\nsickness, accident, and unemployment;\r\n\r\nThe right to a good education.\r\n\r\nAll of these rights spell security. And after this war is won we must be\r\nprepared to move forward, in the implementation of these rights, to new\r\ngoals of human happiness and well-being.\r\n\r\nAmerica's own rightful place in the world depends in large part upon how\r\nfully these and similar rights have been carried into practice for our\r\ncitizens. For unless there is security here at home there cannot be lasting\r\npeace in the world.\r\n\r\nOne of the great American industrialists of our day--a man who has rendered\r\nyeoman service to his country in this crisis--recently emphasized the grave\r\ndangers of \"rightist reaction\" in this Nation. All clear-thinking\r\nbusinessmen share his concern. Indeed, if such reaction should develop--if\r\nhistory were to repeat itself and we were to return to the so-called\r\n\"normalcy\" of the 1920's--then it is certain that even though we shall have\r\nconquered our enemies on the battlefields abroad, we shall have yielded to\r\nthe spirit of Fascism here at home.\r\n\r\nI ask the Congress to explore the means for implementing this economic bill\r\nof rights--for it is definitely the responsibility of the Congress so to\r\ndo. Many of these problems are already before committees of the Congress in\r\nthe form of proposed legislation. I shall from time to time communicate\r\nwith the Congress with respect to these and further proposals. In the event\r\nthat no adequate program of progress is evolved, I am certain that the\r\nNation will be conscious of the fact.\r\n\r\nOur fighting men abroad--and their families at home--expect such a program\r\nand have the right to insist upon it. It is to their demands that this\r\nGovernment should pay heed rather than to the whining demands of selfish\r\npressure groups who seek to feather their nests while young Americans are\r\ndying.\r\n\r\nThe foreign policy that we have been following--the policy that guided us at\r\nMoscow, Cairo, and Teheran--is based on the common sense principle which was\r\nbest expressed by Benjamin Franklin on July 4, 1776: \"We must all hang\r\ntogether, or assuredly we shall all hang separately.\"\r\n\r\nI have often said that there are no two fronts for America in this war.\r\nThere is only one front. There is one line of unity which extends from the\r\nhearts of the people at home to the men of our attacking forces in our\r\nfarthest outposts. When we speak of our total effort, we speak of the\r\nfactory and the field, and the mine as well as of the battleground--we\r\nspeak of the soldier and the civilian, the citizen and his Government.\r\n\r\nEach and every one of us has a solemn obligation under God to serve this\r\nNation in its most critical hour--to keep this Nation great--to make this\r\nNation greater in a better world.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\r\nJanuary 6, 1945\r\n\r\nTo the Congress:\r\n\r\nIn considering the State of the Union, the war and the peace that is to\r\nfollow are naturally uppermost in the minds of all of us.\r\n\r\nThis war must be waged--it is being waged--with the greatest and most\r\npersistent intensity. Everything we are and have is at stake. Everything we\r\nare and have will be given. American men, fighting far from home, have\r\nalready won victories which the world will never forget.\r\n\r\nWe have no question of the ultimate victory. We have no question of the\r\ncost. Our losses will be heavy.\r\n\r\nWe and our allies will go on fighting together to ultimate total victory.\r\n\r\nWe have seen a year marked, on the whole, by substantial progress toward\r\nvictory, even though the year ended with a setback for our arms, when the\r\nGermans launched a ferocious counter-attack into Luxembourg and Belgium\r\nwith the obvious objective of cutting our line in the center.\r\n\r\nOur men have fought with indescribable and unforgettable gallantry under\r\nmost difficult conditions, and our German enemies have sustained\r\nconsiderable losses while failing to obtain their objectives.\r\n\r\nThe high tide of this German effort was reached two days after Christmas.\r\nSince then we have reassumed the offensive, rescued the isolated garrison\r\nat Bastogne, and forced a German withdrawal along the whole line of the\r\nsalient. The speed with which we recovered from this savage attack was\r\nlargely possible because we have one supreme commander in complete control\r\nof all the Allied armies in France. General Eisenhower has faced this\r\nperiod of trial with admirable calm and resolution and with steadily\r\nincreasing success. He has my complete confidence.\r\n\r\nFurther desperate attempts may well be made to break our lines, to slow our\r\nprogress. We must never make the mistake of assuming that the Germans are\r\nbeaten until the last Nazi has surrendered.\r\n\r\nAnd I would express another most serious warning against the poisonous\r\neffects of enemy propaganda.\r\n\r\nThe wedge that the Germans attempted to drive in western Europe was less\r\ndangerous in actual terms of winning the war than the wedges which they are\r\ncontinually attempting to drive between ourselves and our allies.\r\n\r\nEvery little rumor which is intended to weaken our faith in our allies is\r\nlike an actual enemy agent in our midst--seeking to sabotage our war\r\neffort. There are, here and there, evil and baseless rumors against the\r\nRussians--rumors against the British--rumors against our own American\r\ncommanders in the field.\r\n\r\nWhen you examine these rumors closely, you will observe that every one of\r\nthem bears the same trade-mark--\"Made in Germany.\"\r\n\r\nWe must resist this divisive propaganda--we must destroy it--with the same\r\nstrength and the same determination that our fighting men are displaying as\r\nthey resist and destroy the panzer divisions.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, we shall resume the attack and--despite temporary setbacks here\r\nor there--we shall continue the attack relentlessly until Germany is\r\ncompletely defeated.\r\n\r\nIt is appropriate at this time to review the basic strategy which has\r\nguided us through three years of war, and which will lead, eventually, to\r\ntotal victory.\r\n\r\nThe tremendous effort of the first years of this war was directed toward\r\nthe concentration of men and supplies in the various theaters of action at\r\nthe points where they could hurt our enemies most.\r\n\r\nIt was an effort--in the language of the military men--of deployment of our\r\nforces. Many battles--essential battles--were fought; many victories--vital\r\nvictories--were won. But these battles and these victories were fought and\r\nwon to hold back the attacking enemy, and to put us in positions from which\r\nwe and our allies could deliver the final, decisive blows.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning our most important military task was to prevent our\r\nenemies--the strongest and most violently aggressive powers that ever have\r\nthreatened civilization--from winning decisive victories. But even while we\r\nwere conducting defensive, delaying actions, we were looking forward to the\r\ntime when we could wrest the initiative from our enemies and place our\r\nsuperior resources of men and materials into direct competition with them.\r\n\r\nIt was plain then that the defeat of either enemy would require the massing\r\nof overwhelming forces--ground, sea, and air--in positions from which we\r\nand our allies could strike directly against the enemy homelands and\r\ndestroy the Nazi and Japanese war machines.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Japan, we had to await the completion of extensive\r\npreliminary operations--operations designed to establish secure supply lines\r\nthrough the Japanese outer-zone defenses. This called for overwhelming sea\r\npower and air power--supported by ground forces strategically employed\r\nagainst isolated outpost garrisons.\r\n\r\nAlways--from the very day we were attacked--it was right militarily as well\r\nas morally to reject the arguments of those shortsighted people who would\r\nhave had us throw Britain and Russia to the Nazi wolves and concentrate\r\nagainst the Japanese. Such people urged that we fight a purely defensive\r\nwar against Japan while allowing the domination of all the rest of the\r\nworld by Nazism and Fascism.\r\n\r\nIn the European theater the necessary bases for the massing of ground and\r\nair power against Germany were already available in Great Britain. In the\r\nMediterranean area we could begin ground operations against major elements\r\nof the German Army as rapidly as we could put troops in the field, first in\r\nNorth Africa and then in Italy.\r\n\r\nTherefore, our decision was made to concentrate the bulk of our ground and\r\nair forces against Germany until her utter defeat. That decision was based\r\non all these factors; and it was also based on the realization that, of our\r\ntwo enemies, Germany would be more able to digest quickly her conquests,\r\nthe more able quickly to convert the manpower and resources of her\r\nconquered territory into a war potential.\r\n\r\nWe had in Europe two active and indomitable allies--Britain and the Soviet\r\nUnion--and there were also the heroic resistance movements in the occupied\r\ncountries, constantly engaging and harassing the Germans. We cannot forget\r\nhow Britain held the line, alone, in 1940 and 1941; and at the same time,\r\ndespite ferocious bombardment from the air, built up a tremendous armaments\r\nindustry which enabled her to take the offensive at El Alamein in 1942.\r\n\r\nWe cannot forget the heroic defense of Moscow and Leningrad and Stalingrad,\r\nor the tremendous Russian offensives of 1943 and 1944 which destroyed\r\nformidable German armies.\r\n\r\nNor can we forget how, for more than seven long years, the Chinese people\r\nhave been sustaining the barbarous attacks of the Japanese and containing\r\nlarge enemy forces on the vast areas of the Asiatic mainland.\r\n\r\nIn the future we must never forget the lesson that we have learned--that we\r\nmust have friends who will work with us in peace as they have fought at our\r\nside in war.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the combined effort of the Allied forces, great military\r\nvictories were achieved in 1944: The liberation of France, Belgium, Greece,\r\nand parts of The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Yugoslavia, and\r\nCzechoslovakia; the surrender of Rumania and Bulgaria; the invasion of\r\nGermany itself and Hungary; the steady march through the Pacific islands to\r\nthe Philippines, Guam, and Saipan; and the beginnings of a mighty air\r\noffensive against the Japanese islands.\r\n\r\nNow, as this Seventy-ninth Congress meets, we have reached the most\r\ncritical phase of the war.\r\n\r\nThe greatest victory of the last year was, of course, the successful breach\r\non June 6, 1944, of the German \"impregnable\" seawall of Europe and the\r\nvictorious sweep of the Allied forces through France and Belgium and\r\nLuxembourg--almost to the Rhine itself.\r\n\r\nThe cross-channel invasion of the Allied armies was the greatest amphibious\r\noperation in the history of the world. It overshadowed all other operations\r\nin this or any other war in its immensity. Its success is a tribute to the\r\nfighting courage of the soldiers who stormed the beaches--to the sailors\r\nand merchant seamen who put the soldiers ashore and kept them supplied--and\r\nto the military and naval leaders who achieved a real miracle of planning\r\nand execution. And it is also a tribute to the ability of two Nations,\r\nBritain and America, to plan together, and work together, and fight\r\ntogether in perfect cooperation and perfect harmony.\r\n\r\nThis cross-channel invasion was followed in August by a second great\r\namphibious operation, landing troops in southern France. In this, the same\r\ncooperation and the same harmony existed between the American, French, and\r\nother Allied forces based in North Africa and Italy.\r\n\r\nThe success of the two invasions is a tribute also to the ability of many\r\nmen and women to maintain silence, when a few careless words would have\r\nimperiled the lives of hundreds of thousands, and would have jeopardized\r\nthe whole vast undertakings.\r\n\r\nThese two great operations were made possible by success in the Battle of\r\nthe Atlantic.\r\n\r\nWithout this success over German submarines, we could not have built up our\r\ninvasion forces or air forces in Great Britain, nor could we have kept a\r\nsteady stream of supplies flowing to them after they had landed in France.\r\n\r\nThe Nazis, however, may succeed in improving their submarines and their\r\ncrews. They have recently increased their U-boat activity. The Battle of\r\nthe Atlantic--like all campaigns in this war--demands eternal vigilance. But\r\nthe British, Canadian, and other Allied navies, together with our own, are\r\nconstantly on the alert.\r\n\r\nThe tremendous operations in western Europe have overshadowed in the public\r\nmind the less spectacular but vitally important Italian front. Its place in\r\nthe strategic conduct of the war in Europe has been obscured, and--by some\r\npeople unfortunately--underrated.\r\n\r\nIt is important that any misconception on that score be corrected--now.\r\n\r\nWhat the Allied forces in Italy are doing is a well-considered part in our\r\nstrategy in Europe, now aimed at only one objective--the total defeat of\r\nthe Germans. These valiant forces in Italy are continuing to keep a\r\nsubstantial portion of the German Army under constant pressure--including\r\nsome 20 first-line German divisions and the necessary supply and transport\r\nand replacement troops--all of which our enemies need so badly elsewhere.\r\n\r\nOver very difficult terrain and through adverse weather conditions, our\r\nFifth Army and the British Eighth Army--reinforced by units from other\r\nUnited Nations, including a brave and well equipped unit of the Brazilian\r\nArmy--have, in the past year, pushed north through bloody Cassino and the\r\nAnzio beachhead, and through Rome until now they occupy heights overlooking\r\nthe valley of the Po.\r\n\r\nThe greatest tribute which can be paid to the courage and fighting ability\r\nof these splendid soldiers in Italy is to point out that although their\r\nstrength is about equal to that of the Germans they oppose, the Allies have\r\nbeen continuously on the offensive.\r\n\r\nThat pressure, that offensive, by our troops in Italy will continue.\r\n\r\nThe American people--and every soldier now fighting in the Apennines--should\r\nremember that the Italian front has not lost any of the importance which it\r\nhad in the days when it was the only Allied front in Europe.\r\n\r\nIn the Pacific during the past year, we have conducted the fastest-moving\r\noffensive in the history of modern warfare. We have driven the enemy back\r\nmore than 3,000 miles across the Central Pacific. A year ago, our conquest\r\nof Tarawa was a little more than a month old.\r\n\r\nA year ago, we were preparing for our invasion of Kwajalein, the second of\r\nour great strides across the Central Pacific to the Philippines.\r\n\r\nA year ago, General MacArthur was still fighting in New Guinea almost 1,500\r\nmiles from his present position in the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\nWe now have firmly established bases in the Mariana Islands, from which our\r\nSuper fortresses bomb Tokyo itself--and will continue to blast Japan in\r\never-increasing numbers.\r\n\r\nJapanese forces in the Philippines have been cut in two. There is still\r\nhard fighting ahead--costly fighting. But the liberation of the Philippines\r\nwill mean that Japan has been largely cut off from her conquests in the\r\nEast Indies.\r\n\r\nThe landing of our troops on Leyte was the largest amphibious operation\r\nthus far conducted in the Pacific.\r\n\r\nMoreover, these landings drew the Japanese Fleet into the first great sea\r\nbattle which Japan has risked in almost two years. Not since the night\r\nengagements around Guadalcanal in November-December, 1942, had our Navy\r\nbeen able to come to grips with major units of the Japanese Fleet. We had\r\nbrushed against their fleet in the first battle of the Philippine Sea in\r\nJune, 1944, but not until last October were we able really to engage a\r\nmajor portion of the Japanese Navy in actual combat. The naval engagement\r\nwhich raged for three days was the heaviest blow ever struck against\r\nJapanese sea power.\r\n\r\nAs a result of that battle, much of what is left of the Japanese Fleet has\r\nbeen driven behind the screen of islands that separates the Yellow Sea, the\r\nChina Sea, and the Sea of Japan from the Pacific.\r\n\r\nOur Navy looks forward to any opportunity which the lords of the Japanese\r\nNavy will give us to fight them again.\r\n\r\nThe people of this Nation have a right to be proud of the courage and\r\nfighting ability of the men in the armed forces--on all fronts. They also\r\nhave a right to be proud of American leadership which has guided their sons\r\ninto battle.\r\n\r\nThe history of the generalship of this war has been a history of teamwork\r\nand cooperation, of skill and daring. Let me give you one example out of\r\nlast year's operations in the Pacific.\r\n\r\nLast September Admiral Halsey led American naval task forces into\r\nPhilippine waters and north to the East China Sea, and struck heavy blows\r\nat Japanese air and sea power.\r\n\r\nAt that time it was our plan to approach the Philippines by further stages,\r\ntaking islands which we may call A, C, and E. However, Admiral Halsey\r\nreported that a direct attack on Leyte appeared feasible. When General\r\nMacArthur received the reports from Admiral Halsey's task forces, he also\r\nconcluded that it might be possible to attack the Japanese in the\r\nPhilippines directly--bypassing islands A, C, and E.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Nimitz thereupon offered to make available to General MacArthur\r\nseveral divisions which had been scheduled to take the intermediate\r\nobjectives. These discussions, conducted at great distances, all took place\r\nin one day.\r\n\r\nGeneral MacArthur immediately informed the Joint Chiefs of Staff here in\r\nWashington that he was prepared to initiate plans for an attack on Leyte in\r\nOctober. Approval of the change in plan was given on the same day.\r\n\r\nThus, within the space of 24 hours, a major change of plans was\r\naccomplished which involved Army and Navy forces from two different\r\ntheaters of operations--a change which hastened the liberation of the\r\nPhilippines and the final day of victory--a change which saved lives which\r\nwould have been expended in the capture of islands which are now\r\nneutralized far behind our lines.\r\n\r\nOur over-all strategy has not neglected the important task of rendering all\r\npossible aid to China. Despite almost insuperable difficulties, we\r\nincreased this aid during 1944. At present our aid to China must be\r\naccomplished by air transport--there is no other way. By the end of 1944,\r\nthe Air Transport Command was carrying into China a tonnage of supplies\r\nthree times as great as that delivered a year ago, and much more, each\r\nmonth, than the Burma Road ever delivered at its peak.\r\n\r\nDespite the loss of important bases in China, the tonnage delivered by air\r\ntransport has enabled General Chennault's Fourteenth Air Force, which\r\nincludes many Chinese flyers, to wage an effective and aggressive campaign\r\nagainst the Japanese. In 1944 aircraft of the Fourteenth Air Force flew\r\nmore than 35,000 sorties against the Japanese and sank enormous tonnage of\r\nenemy shipping, greatly diminishing the usefulness of the China Sea lanes.\r\n\r\nBritish, Dominion, and Chinese forces together with our own have not only\r\nheld the line in Burma against determined Japanese attacks but have gained\r\nbases of considerable importance to the supply line into China.\r\n\r\nThe Burma campaigns have involved incredible hardship, and have demanded\r\nexceptional fortitude and determination. The officers and men who have\r\nserved with so much devotion in these far distant jungles and mountains\r\ndeserve high honor from their countrymen.\r\n\r\nIn all of the far-flung operations of our own armed forces--on land, and sea\r\nand in the air--the final job, the toughest job, has been performed by the\r\naverage, easy-going, hard-fighting young American, who carries the weight\r\nof battle on his own shoulders.\r\n\r\nIt is to him that we and all future generations of Americans must pay\r\ngrateful tribute.\r\n\r\nBut--it is of small satisfaction to him to know that monuments will be\r\nraised to him in the future. He wants, he needs, and he is entitled to\r\ninsist upon, our full and active support--now.\r\n\r\nAlthough unprecedented production figures have made possible our victories,\r\nwe shall have to increase our goals even more in certain items.\r\n\r\nPeak deliveries of supplies were made to the War Department in December,\r\n1943. Due in part to cutbacks, we have not produced as much since then.\r\nDeliveries of Army supplies were down by 15 percent by July, 1944, before\r\nthe upward trend was once more resumed.\r\n\r\nBecause of increased demands from overseas, the Army Service Forces in the\r\nmonth of October, 1944, had to increase its estimate of required production\r\nby 10 percent. But in November, one month later, the requirements for 1945\r\nhad to be increased another 10 percent, sending the production goal well\r\nabove anything we have yet attained. Our armed forces in combat have\r\nsteadily increased their expenditure of medium and heavy artillery\r\nammunition. As we continue the decisive phases of this war, the munitions\r\nthat we expend will mount day by day.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1944, while some were saying the war in Europe was over, the\r\nArmy was shipping more men to Europe than in any previous month of the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nOne of the most urgent immediate requirements of the armed forces is more\r\nnurses. Last April the Army requirement for nurses was set at 50,000.\r\nActual strength in nurses was then 40,000. Since that time the Army has\r\ntried to raise the additional 10,000. Active recruiting has been carried\r\non, but the net gain in eight months has been only 2,000. There are now\r\n42,000 nurses in the Army.\r\n\r\nRecent estimates have increased the total number needed to 60,000. That\r\nmeans that 18,000 more nurses must be obtained for the Army alone and the\r\nNavy now requires 2,000 additional nurses.\r\n\r\nThe present shortage of Army nurses is reflected in undue strain on the\r\nexisting force. More than a thousand nurses are now hospitalized, and part\r\nof this is due to overwork. The shortage is also indicated by the fact that\r\n11 Army hospital units have been sent overseas without their complement of\r\nnurses. At Army hospitals in the United States there is only 1 nurse to 26\r\nbeds, instead of the recommended 1 to 15 beds.\r\n\r\nIt is tragic that the gallant women who have volunteered for service as\r\nnurses should be so overworked. It is tragic that our wounded men should\r\never want for the best possible nursing care.\r\n\r\nThe inability to get the needed nurses for the Army is not due to any\r\nshortage of nurses; 280,000 registered nurses are now practicing in this\r\ncountry. It has been estimated by the War Manpower Commission that 27,000\r\nadditional nurses could be made available to the armed forces without\r\ninterfering too seriously with the needs of the civilian population for\r\nnurses.\r\n\r\nSince volunteering has not produced the number of nurses required, I urge\r\nthat the Selective Service Act be amended to provide for the induction of\r\nnurses into the armed forces. The need is too pressing to await the outcome\r\nof further efforts at recruiting.\r\n\r\nThe care and treatment given to our wounded and sick soldiers have been the\r\nbest known to medical science. Those standards must be maintained at all\r\ncosts. We cannot tolerate a lowering of them by failure to provide adequate\r\nnursing for the brave men who stand desperately in need of it.\r\n\r\nIn the continuing progress of this war we have constant need for new types\r\nof weapons, for we cannot afford to fight the war of today or tomorrow with\r\nthe weapons of yesterday. For example, the American Army now has developed\r\na new tank with a gun more powerful than any yet mounted on a fast-moving\r\nvehicle. The Army will need many thousands of these new tanks in 1945.\r\n\r\nAlmost every month finds some new development in electronics which must be\r\nput into production in order to maintain our technical superiority--and in\r\norder to save lives. We have to work every day to keep ahead of the enemy\r\nin radar. On D-Day, in France, with our superior new equipment, we located\r\nand then put out of operation every warning set which the Germans had along\r\nthe French coast.\r\n\r\nIf we do not keep constantly ahead of our enemies in the development of new\r\nweapons, we pay for our backwardness with the life's blood of our sons.\r\n\r\nThe only way to meet these increased needs for new weapons and more of them\r\nis for every American engaged in war work to stay on his war job--for\r\nadditional American civilians, men and women, not engaged in essential\r\nwork, to go out and get a war job. Workers who are released because their\r\nproduction is cut back should get another job where production is being\r\nincreased. This is no time to quit or change to less essential jobs.\r\n\r\nThere is an old and true saying that the Lord hates a quitter. And this\r\nNation must pay for all those who leave their essential jobs--or all those\r\nwho lay down on their essential jobs for nonessential reasons.\r\nAnd--again--that payment must be made with the life's blood of our sons.\r\n\r\nMany critical production programs with sharply rising needs are now\r\nseriously hampered by manpower shortages. The most important Army needs are\r\nartillery ammunition, cotton duck, bombs, tires, tanks, heavy trucks, and\r\neven B-29's. In each of these vital programs, present production is behind\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\nNavy production of bombardment ammunition is hampered by manpower\r\nshortages; so is production for its huge rocket program. Labor shortages\r\nhave also delayed its cruiser and carrier programs, and production of\r\ncertain types of aircraft.\r\n\r\nThere is critical need for more repair workers and repair parts; this Jack\r\ndelays the return of damaged fighting ships to their places in the fleet,\r\nand prevents ships now in the fighting line from getting needed\r\noverhauling.\r\n\r\nThe pool of young men under 26 classified as I-A is almost depleted.\r\nIncreased replacements for the armed forces will take men now deferred who\r\nare at work in war industry. The armed forces must have an assurance of a\r\nsteady flow of young men for replacements. Meeting this paramount need will\r\nbe difficult, and will also make it progressively more difficult to attain\r\nthe 1945 production goals.\r\n\r\nLast year, after much consideration, I recommended that the Congress adopt\r\na national service act as the most efficient and democratic way of insuring\r\nfull production for our war requirements. This recommendation was not\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nI now again call upon the Congress to enact this measure for the total\r\nmobilization of all our human resources for the prosecution of the war. I\r\nurge that this be done at the earliest possible moment.\r\n\r\nIt is not too late in the war. In fact, bitter experience has shown that in\r\nthis kind of mechanized warfare where new weapons are constantly being\r\ncreated by our enemies and by ourselves, the closer we come to the end of\r\nthe war, the more pressing becomes the need for sustained war production\r\nwith which to deliver the final blow to the enemy.\r\n\r\nThere are three basic arguments for a national service law:\r\n\r\nFirst, it would assure that we have the right numbers of workers in the\r\nright places at the right times.\r\n\r\nSecond, it would provide supreme proof to all our fighting men that we are\r\ngiving them what they are entitled to, which is nothing less than our total\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nAnd, third, it would be the final, unequivocal answer to the hopes of the\r\nNazis and the Japanese that we may become halfhearted about this war and\r\nthat they can get from us a negotiated peace.\r\n\r\nNational service legislation would make it possible to put ourselves in a\r\nposition to assure certain and speedy action in meeting our manpower\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\nIt would be used only to the extent absolutely required by military\r\nnecessities. In fact, experience in Great Britain and in other Nations at\r\nwar indicates that use of the compulsory powers of national service is\r\nnecessary only in rare instances.\r\n\r\nThis proposed legislation would provide against loss of retirement and\r\nseniority rights and benefits. It would not mean reduction in wages.\r\n\r\nIn adopting such legislation, it is not necessary to discard the voluntary\r\nand cooperative processes which have prevailed up to this time. This\r\ncooperation has already produced great results. The contribution of our\r\nworkers to the war effort has been beyond measure. We must build on the\r\nfoundations that have already been laid and supplement the measures now in\r\noperation, in order to guarantee the production that may be necessary in\r\nthe critical period that lies ahead.\r\n\r\nAt the present time we are using the inadequate tools at hand to do the\r\nbest we can by such expedients as manpower ceilings, and the use of\r\npriority and other powers, to induce men and women to shift from\r\nnon-essential to essential war jobs.\r\n\r\nI am in receipt of a joint letter from the Secretary of War and the\r\nSecretary of the Navy, dated January 3, 1945, which says:\r\n\r\n\"With the experience of three years of war and after the most thorough\r\nconsideration, we are convinced that it is now necessary to carry out the\r\nstatement made by the Congress in the joint resolutions declaring that a\r\nstate of war existed with Japan and Germany: That 'to bring the conflict to\r\na successful conclusion, all of the resources of the country are hereby\r\npledged by the Congress of the United States.'\r\n\r\n\"In our considered judgment, which is supported by General Marshall and\r\nAdmiral King, this requires total mobilization of our manpower by the\r\npassage of a national war service law. The armed forces need this\r\nlegislation to hasten the day of final victory, and to keep to a minimum\r\nthe cost in lives.\r\n\r\n\"National war service, the recognition by law of the duty of every citizen\r\nto do his or her part in winning the war, will give complete assurance that\r\nthe need for war equipment will be filled. In the coming year we must\r\nincrease the output of many weapons and supplies on short notice. Otherwise\r\nwe shall not keep our production abreast of the swiftly changing needs of\r\nwar. At the same time it will be necessary to draw progressively many men\r\nnow engaged in war production to serve with the armed forces, and their\r\nplaces in war production must be filled promptly. These developments will\r\nrequire the addition of hundreds of thousands to those already working in\r\nwar industry. We do not believe that these needs can be met effectively\r\nunder present methods.\r\n\r\n\"The record made by management and labor in war industry has been a notable\r\ntestimony to the resourcefulness and power of America. The needs are so\r\ngreat, nevertheless, that in many instances we have been forced to recall\r\nsoldiers and sailors from military duty to do work of a civilian character\r\nin war production, because of the urgency of the need for equipment and\r\nbecause of inability to recruit civilian labor.\"\r\n\r\nPending action by the Congress on the broader aspects of national service,\r\nI recommend that the Congress immediately enact legislation which will be\r\neffective in using the services of the 4,000,000 men now classified as IV-F\r\nin whatever capacity is best for the war effort.\r\n\r\nIn the field of foreign policy, we propose to stand together with the\r\nUnited Nations not for the war alone but for the victory for which the war\r\nis fought.\r\n\r\nIt is not only a common danger which unites us but a common hope. Ours is\r\nan association not of Governments but of peoples--and the peoples' hope is\r\npeace. Here, as in England; in England, as in Russia; in Russia, as in\r\nChina; in France, and through the continent of Europe, and throughout the\r\nworld; wherever men love freedom, the hope and purpose of the people are\r\nfor peace--a peace that is durable and secure.\r\n\r\nIt will not be easy to create this peoples' peace. We delude ourselves if\r\nwe believe that the surrender of the armies of our enemies will make the\r\npeace we long for. The unconditional surrender of the armies of our enemies\r\nis the first and necessary step--but the first step only.\r\n\r\nWe have seen already, in areas liberated from the Nazi and the Fascist\r\ntyranny, what problems peace will bring. And we delude ourselves if we\r\nattempt to believe wishfully that all these problems can be solved\r\novernight.\r\n\r\nThe firm foundation can be built--and it will be built. But the continuance\r\nand assurance of a living peace must, in the long run, be the work of the\r\npeople themselves.\r\n\r\nWe ourselves, like all peoples who have gone through the difficult\r\nprocesses of liberation and adjustment, know of our own experience how\r\ngreat the difficulties can be. We know that they are not difficulties\r\npeculiar to any continent or any Nation. Our own Revolutionary War left\r\nbehind it, in the words of one American historian, \"an eddy of lawlessness\r\nand disregard of human life.\" There were separatist movements of one kind\r\nor another in Vermont, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, and\r\nMaine. There were insurrections, open or threatened, in Massachusetts and\r\nNew Hampshire. These difficulties we worked out for ourselves as the\r\npeoples of the liberated areas of Europe, faced with complex problems of\r\nadjustment, will work out their difficulties for themselves.\r\n\r\nPeace can be made and kept only by the united determination of free and\r\npeace-loving peoples who are willing to work together--willing to help one\r\nanother--willing to respect and tolerate and try to understand one another's\r\nopinions and feelings.\r\n\r\nThe nearer we come to vanquishing our enemies the more we inevitably become\r\nconscious of differences among the victors.\r\n\r\nWe must not let those differences divide us and blind us to our more\r\nimportant common and continuing interests in winning the war and building\r\nthe peace.\r\n\r\nInternational cooperation on which enduring peace must be based is not a\r\none-way street.\r\n\r\nNations like individuals do not always see alike or think alike, and\r\ninternational cooperation and progress are not helped by any Nation\r\nassuming that it has a monopoly of wisdom or of virtue.\r\n\r\nIn the future world the misuse of power, as implied in the term \"power\r\npolitics,\" must not be a controlling factor in international relations.\r\nThat is the heart of the principles to which we have subscribed. We cannot\r\ndeny that power is a factor in world politics any more than we can deny its\r\nexistence as a factor in national politics. But in a democratic world, as\r\nin a democratic Nation, power must be linked with responsibility, and\r\nobliged to defend and justify itself within the framework of the general\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nPerfectionism, no less than isolationism or imperialism or power politics,\r\nmay obstruct the paths to international peace. Let us not forget that the\r\nretreat to isolationism a quarter of a century ago was started not by a\r\ndirect attack against international cooperation but against the alleged\r\nimperfections of the peace.\r\n\r\nIn our disillusionment after the last war we preferred international\r\nanarchy to international cooperation with Nations which did not see and\r\nthink exactly as we did. We gave up the hope of gradually achieving a\r\nbetter peace because we had not the courage to fulfill our responsibilities\r\nin an admittedly imperfect world.\r\n\r\nWe must not let that happen again, or we shall follow the same tragic road\r\nagain--the road to a third world war.\r\n\r\nWe can fulfill our responsibilities for maintaining the security of our own\r\ncountry only by exercising our power and our influence to achieve the\r\nprinciples in which we believe and for which we have fought.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1941, Prime Minister Churchill and I agreed to the principles of\r\nthe Atlantic Charter, these being later incorporated into the Declaration\r\nby United Nations of January 1, 1942. At that time certain isolationists\r\nprotested vigorously against our right to proclaim the principles--and\r\nagainst the very principles themselves. Today, many of the same people are\r\nprotesting against the possibility of violation of the same principles.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the statement of principles in the Atlantic Charter does\r\nnot provide rules of easy application to each and every one of this\r\nwar-torn world's tangled situations. But it is a good and a useful thing--\r\nit is an essential thing--to have principles toward which we can aim.\r\n\r\nAnd we shall not hesitate to use our influence--and to use it now--to secure\r\nso far as is humanly possible the fulfillment of the principles of the\r\nAtlantic Charter. We have not shrunk from the military responsibilities\r\nbrought on by this war. We cannot and will not shrink from the political\r\nresponsibilities which follow in the wake of battle.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to give the impression that all mistakes can be avoided and\r\nthat many disappointments are not inevitable in the making of peace. But we\r\nmust not this time lose the hope of establishing an international order\r\nwhich will be capable of maintaining peace and realizing through the years\r\nmore perfect justice between Nations.\r\n\r\nTo do this we must be on our guard not to exploit and exaggerate the\r\ndifferences between us and our allies, particularly with reference to the\r\npeoples who have been liberated from Fascist tyranny. That is not the way\r\nto secure a better settlement of those differences or to secure\r\ninternational machinery which can rectify mistakes which may be made.\r\n\r\nI should not be frank if I did not admit concern about many situations--the\r\nGreek and Polish for example. But those situations are not as easy or as\r\nsimple to deal with as some spokesmen, whose sincerity I do not question,\r\nwould have us believe. We have obligations, not necessarily legal, to the\r\nexiled Governments, to the underground leaders, and to our major allies who\r\ncame much nearer the shadows than we did.\r\n\r\nWe and our allies have declared that it is our purpose to respect the right\r\nof all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live\r\nand to see sovereign rights and self-government restored to those who have\r\nbeen forcibly deprived of them. But with internal dissension, with many\r\ncitizens of liberated countries still prisoners of war or forced to labor\r\nin Germany, it is difficult to guess the kind of self-government the people\r\nreally want.\r\n\r\nDuring the interim period, until conditions permit a genuine expression of\r\nthe people's will, we and our allies have a duty, which we cannot ignore,\r\nto use our influence to the end that no temporary or provisional\r\nauthorities in the liberated countries block the eventual exercise of the\r\npeoples' right freely to choose the government and institutions under\r\nwhich, as freemen, they are to live.\r\n\r\nIt is only too easy for all of us to rationalize what we want to believe,\r\nand to consider those leaders we like responsible and those we dislike\r\nirresponsible. And our task is not helped by stubborn partisanship, however\r\nunderstandable on the part of opposed internal factions.\r\n\r\nIt is our purpose to help the peace-loving peoples of Europe to live\r\ntogether as good neighbors, to recognize their common interests and not to\r\nnurse their traditional grievances against one another.\r\n\r\nBut we must not permit the many specific and immediate problems of\r\nadjustment connected with the liberation of Europe to delay the\r\nestablishment of permanent machinery for the maintenance of peace. Under\r\nthe threat of a common danger, the United Nations joined together in war to\r\npreserve their independence and their freedom. They must now join together\r\nto make secure the independence and freedom of all peace-loving states, so\r\nthat never again shall tyranny be able to divide and conquer.\r\n\r\nInternational peace and well-being, like national peace and well-being,\r\nrequire constant alertness, continuing cooperation, and organized effort.\r\n\r\nInternational peace and well-being, like national peace and well-being, can\r\nbe secured only through institutions capable of life and growth.\r\n\r\nMany of the problems of the peace are upon us even now while the conclusion\r\nof the war is still before us. The atmosphere of friendship and mutual\r\nunderstanding and determination to find a common ground of common\r\nunderstanding, which surrounded the conversations at Dumbarton Oaks, gives\r\nus reason to hope that future discussions will succeed in developing the\r\ndemocratic and fully integrated world security system toward which these\r\npreparatory conversations were directed.\r\n\r\nWe and the other United Nations are going forward, with vigor and\r\nresolution, in our efforts to create such a system by providing for it\r\nstrong and flexible institutions of joint and cooperative action.\r\n\r\nThe aroused conscience of humanity will not permit failure in this supreme\r\nendeavor.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the extraordinary advances in the means of\r\nintercommunication between peoples over the past generation offer a\r\npractical method of advancing the mutual understanding upon which peace and\r\nthe institutions of peace must rest, and it is our policy and purpose to\r\nuse these great technological achievements for the common advantage of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nWe support the greatest possible freedom of trade and commerce.\r\n\r\nWe Americans have always believed in freedom of opportunity, and equality\r\nof opportunity remains one of the principal objectives of our national\r\nlife. What we believe in for individuals, we believe in also for Nations.\r\nWe are opposed to restrictions, whether by public act or private\r\narrangement, which distort and impair commerce, transit, and trade.\r\n\r\nWe have house-cleaning of our own to do in this regard. But it is our hope,\r\nnot only in the interest of our own prosperity but in the interest of the\r\nprosperity of the world, that trade and commerce and access to materials\r\nand markets may be freer after this war than ever before in the history of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nOne of the most heartening events of the year in the international field\r\nhas been the renaissance of the French people and the return of the French\r\nNation to the ranks of the United Nations. Far from having been crushed by\r\nthe terror of Nazi domination, the French people have emerged with stronger\r\nfaith than ever in the destiny of their country and in the soundness of the\r\ndemocratic ideals to which the French Nation has traditionally contributed\r\nso greatly.\r\n\r\nDuring her liberation, France has given proof of her unceasing\r\ndetermination to fight the Germans, continuing the heroic efforts of the\r\nresistance groups under the occupation and of all those Frenchmen\r\nthroughout the world who refused to surrender after the disaster of 1940.\r\n\r\nToday, French armies are again on the German frontier, and are again\r\nfighting shoulder to shoulder with our sons.\r\n\r\nSince our landings in Africa, we have placed in French hands all the arms\r\nand material of war which our resources and the military situation\r\npermitted. And I am glad to say that we are now about to equip large new\r\nFrench forces with the most modern weapons for combat duty.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the contribution which France can make to our common\r\nvictory, her liberation likewise means that her great influence will again\r\nbe available in meeting the problems of peace.\r\n\r\nWe fully recognize France's vital interest in a lasting solution of the\r\nGerman problem and the contribution which she can make in achieving\r\ninternational security. Her formal adherence to the declaration by United\r\nNations a few days ago and the proposal at the Dumbarton Oaks discussions,\r\nwhereby France would receive one of the five permanent seats in the\r\nproposed Security Council, demonstrate the extent to which France has\r\nresumed her proper position of strength and leadership.\r\n\r\nI am clear in my own mind that, as an essential factor in the maintenance\r\nof peace in the future, we must have universal military training after this\r\nwar, and I shall send a special message to the Congress on this subject.\r\n\r\nAn enduring peace cannot be achieved without a strong America--strong in\r\nthe social and economic sense as well as in the military sense.\r\n\r\nIn the State of the Union message last year I set forth what I considered\r\nto be an American economic bill of rights.\r\n\r\nI said then, and I say now, that these economic truths represent a second\r\nbill of rights under which a new basis of security and prosperity can be\r\nestablished for all--regardless of station, race, or creed.\r\n\r\nOf these rights the most fundamental, and one on which the fulfillment of\r\nthe others in large degree depends, is the \"right to a useful and\r\nremunerative job in the industries or shops or farms or mines of the\r\nNation.\" In turn, others of the economic rights of American citizenship,\r\nsuch as the right to a decent home, to a good education, to good medical\r\ncare, to social security, to reasonable farm income, will, if fulfilled,\r\nmake major contributions to achieving adequate levels of employment.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Government must see to it that these rights become\r\nrealities--with the help of States, municipalities, business, labor, and\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nWe have had full employment during the war. We have had it because the\r\nGovernment has been ready to buy all the materials of war which the country\r\ncould produce--and this has amounted to approximately half our present\r\nproductive capacity.\r\n\r\nAfter the war we must maintain full employment with Government performing\r\nits peacetime functions. This means that we must achieve a level of demand\r\nand purchasing power by private consumers--farmers, businessmen, workers,\r\nprofessional men, housewives--which is sufficiently high to replace wartime\r\nGovernment demands; and it means also that we must greatly increase our\r\nexport trade above the prewar level.\r\n\r\nOur policy is, of course, to rely as much as possible on private enterprise\r\nto provide jobs. But the American people will not accept mass unemployment\r\nor mere makeshift work. There will be need for the work of everyone willing\r\nand able to work--and that means close to 60,000,000 jobs.\r\n\r\nFull employment means not only jobs--but productive jobs. Americans do not\r\nregard jobs that pay substandard wages as productive jobs.\r\n\r\nWe must make sure that private enterprise works as it is supposed to work--\r\non the basis of initiative and vigorous competition, without the stifling\r\npresence of monopolies and cartels.\r\n\r\nDuring the war we have guaranteed investment in enterprise essential to the\r\nwar effort. We should also take appropriate measures in peacetime to secure\r\nopportunities for new small enterprises and for productive business\r\nexpansion for which finance would otherwise be unavailable.\r\n\r\nThis necessary expansion of our peacetime productive capacity will require\r\nnew facilities, new plants, and new equipment.\r\n\r\nIt will require large outlays of money which should be raised through\r\nnormal investment channels. But while private capital should finance this\r\nexpansion program, the Government should recognize its responsibility for\r\nsharing part of any special or abnormal risk of loss attached to such\r\nfinancing.\r\n\r\nOur full-employment program requires the extensive development of our\r\nnatural resources and other useful public works. The undeveloped resources\r\nof this continent are still vast. Our river-watershed projects will add new\r\nand fertile territories to the United States. The Tennessee Valley\r\nAuthority, which was constructed at a cost of $750,000,000--the cost of\r\nwaging this war for less than 4 days--was a bargain. We have similar\r\nopportunities in our other great river basins. By harnessing the resources\r\nof these river basins, as we have in the Tennessee Valley, we shall provide\r\nthe same kind of stimulus to enterprise as was provided by the Louisiana\r\nPurchase and the new discoveries in the West during the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nIf we are to avail ourselves fully of the benefits of civil aviation, and\r\nif we are to use the automobiles we can produce, it will be necessary to\r\nconstruct thousands of airports and to overhaul our entire national highway\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe provision of a decent home for every family is a national necessity, if\r\nthis country is to be worthy of its greatness--and that task will itself\r\ncreate great employment opportunities. Most of our cities need extensive\r\nrebuilding. Much of our farm plant is in a state of disrepair. To make a\r\nfrontal attack on the problems of housing and urban reconstruction will\r\nrequire thoroughgoing cooperation between industry and labor, and the\r\nFederal, State, and local Governments.\r\n\r\nAn expanded social security program, and adequate health and education\r\nprograms, must play essential roles in a program designed to support\r\nindividual productivity and mass purchasing power. I shall communicate\r\nfurther with the Congress on these subjects at a later date.\r\n\r\nThe millions of productive jobs that a program of this nature could bring\r\nare jobs in private enterprise. They are jobs based on the expanded demand\r\nfor the output of our economy for consumption and investment. Through a\r\nprogram of this character we can maintain a national income high enough to\r\nprovide for an orderly retirement of the public debt along with reasonable\r\ntax reduction.\r\n\r\nOur present tax system geared primarily to war requirements must be revised\r\nfor peacetime so as to encourage private demand.\r\n\r\nWhile no general revision of the tax structure can be made until the war\r\nends on all fronts, the Congress should be prepared to provide tax\r\nmodifications at the end of the war in Europe, designed to encourage\r\ncapital to invest in new enterprises and to provide jobs. As an integral\r\npart of this program to maintain high employment, we must, after the war is\r\nover, reduce or eliminate taxes which bear too heavily on consumption.\r\n\r\nThe war will leave deep disturbances in the world economy, in our national\r\neconomy, in many communities, in many families, and in many individuals. It\r\nwill require determined effort and responsible action of all of us to find\r\nour way back to peacetime, and to help others to find their way back to\r\npeacetime--a peacetime that holds the values of the past and the promise of\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nIf we attack our problems with determination we shall succeed. And we must\r\nsucceed. For freedom and peace cannot exist without security.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year the American people, in a national election,\r\nreasserted their democratic faith.\r\n\r\nIn the course of that campaign various references were made to \"strife\"\r\nbetween this Administration and the Congress, with the implication, if not\r\nthe direct assertion, that this Administration and the Congress could never\r\nwork together harmoniously in the service of the Nation.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that there have been disagreements between the\r\nlegislative and executive branches--as there have been disagreements during\r\nthe past century and a half.\r\n\r\nI think we all realize too that there are some people in this Capital City\r\nwhose task is in large part to stir up dissension, and to magnify normal\r\nhealthy disagreements so that they appear to be irreconcilable conflicts.\r\n\r\nBut--I think that the over-all record in this respect is eloquent: The\r\nGovernment of the United States of America--all branches of it--has a good\r\nrecord of achievement in this war.\r\n\r\nThe Congress, the Executive, and the Judiciary have worked together for the\r\ncommon good.\r\n\r\nI myself want to tell you, the Members of the Senate and of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, how happy I am in our relationships and friendships. I\r\nhave not yet had the pleasure of meeting some of the new Members in each\r\nHouse, but I hope that opportunity will offer itself in the near future.\r\n\r\nWe have a great many problems ahead of us and we must approach them with\r\nrealism and courage.\r\n\r\nThis new year of 1945 can be the greatest year of achievement in human\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nNineteen forty-five can see the final ending of the Nazi-Fascist reign of\r\nterror in Europe.\r\n\r\nNineteen forty-five can see the closing in of the forces of retribution\r\nabout the center of the malignant power of imperialistic Japan.\r\n\r\nMost important of all--1945 can and must see the substantial beginning of\r\nthe organization of world peace. This organization must be the fulfillment\r\nof the promise for which men have fought and died in this war. It must be\r\nthe justification of all the sacrifices that have been made--of all the\r\ndreadful misery that this world has endured.\r\n\r\nWe Americans of today, together with our allies, are making history--and I\r\nhope it will be better history than ever has been made before.\r\n\r\nWe pray that we may be worthy of the unlimited opportunities that God has\r\ngiven us.",
