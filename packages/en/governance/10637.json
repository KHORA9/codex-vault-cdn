The author has corrected several errors\r\nof fact, which were noted by American reviewers on the appearance of the\r\ntranslation, and has also made sundry changes in the work, designed to\r\nbring it down to the present time, and to adapt its counsels to the new\r\nlight that is breaking in upon us in the progress of events. These\r\nchanges, however, have been few, and relate chiefly to the policy of\r\nemancipation, for so truly has this remarkable book proved a prophecy,\r\nthat the author, on reviewing it after a lapse of several eventful\r\nmonths, can find nothing to strike out as having proved untrue. We are\r\nindebted to the kindness of Count de Gasparin for one or two corrections\r\nof trifling biographical misstatements in the translator's preface.\r\n\r\nThe pamphlet concerning the Trent affair, and the surrender of Messrs.\r\nMason and Slidell, which we append to this edition, will be read with\r\ninterest at the present crisis, as an able exposition of the views of\r\nEuropean statesmen on the international difficulty which has sprung so\r\nunexpectedly upon us. While it justifies the surrender on the ground of\r\ntechnical error, it utters a solemn warning in the name of Europe, that,\r\nif the demand were a mere pretext to force us into a ruinous war, such a\r\nproceeding will not again be tolerated. This pamphlet, entitled _Une\r\nParole de Paix_, is the article which appeared in the _Journal des\r\nDébats_, December 11, 12, and 13, since published as a _brochure_, with\r\nsome additions.\r\n\r\nThis new edition is especially valuable, inasmuch as it seals the faith\r\nof our noble friend and sympathizer. \"A few months ago,\" says Count de\r\nGasparin, in his preface, \"I believed in the uprising of a great people;\r\nnow I am sure of it.\" Let not the issue shame us by disappointing his\r\ntrust!\r\n\r\nMARY L. BOOTH.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, _February_, 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nTO THE SECOND EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have nothing to change in these pages. When I wrote them before the\r\nbreaking out of the American crisis, I foreboded, which was not\r\ndifficult, that the crisis would be long and grievous, that there would\r\nbe mistakes and reverses; but I foreboded, also, that through these\r\nmistakes and reverses, an immense progress was about to come to light.\r\nSome have undertaken to doubt it: at the sight of civil war, and the\r\nevils which it necessarily entails, at the recital of one or two\r\ndefeats, they have hastened to raise their hands to Heaven, and to\r\nproclaim in every key the ruin of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to discuss judgments, sometimes superficial,\r\nsometimes malevolent, which too often pass current among us; to examine\r\nwhat has been, what should be the attitude of our Europe, what is our\r\nresponsibility, what are our interests and our duties. We alone, I am\r\nashamed to admit it, we alone run the risk of rendering doubtful the\r\nfinal triumph of the good cause; we have not ceased to be, in spite of\r\nourselves, the only chance and the only hope of the champions of\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I shall enter ere long, in a new study, upon the important\r\nsubject which I confine myself to indicating here, and which\r\npre-occupies the government at Washington to such a degree that it seems\r\ninclined to order defensive preparations in view of an unnatural\r\nconflict between liberal America and ourselves. Everything may\r\nhappen--alas! the seemingly impossible like all else. It is not enough,\r\ntherefore, to declare this impossible and monstrous, it is not enough to\r\nprove that the present state of feeling in Europe is far from giving\r\nreason to foresee an intervention in favor of the South; it is necessary\r\nto sap at the base these deplorable sophisms, more fully credited than\r\nis imagined, which may, in due time, under the pressure of certain\r\nindustrial needs or of certain political combinations, urge France and\r\nEngland into a course which is not their own.\r\n\r\nFor the present, I have only wished to repeat, with a strengthened\r\nconviction, what I said a few months ago. I believed then in the\r\nuprising of a great people; now I am sure of it.\r\n\r\nVALLEYRES, _November_ 2, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this moment, when we are anxiously scrutinizing every indication of\r\nEuropean feeling with respect to the American question, the advent of a\r\nbook, bearing the stamp of a close philosophical, political, and\r\npractical study of the subject, and written, withal, in so hopeful a\r\nspirit as to make us feel with the writer that whatever may result from\r\nthe present crisis must be for good, cannot fail to be of public\r\ninterest and utility. So truly prophetic is this work in its essence,\r\nthat we can hardly believe that it was written in great part amid the\r\nmists that preceded the inauguration of Mr. Lincoln. All probabilities\r\nappear to have been foreseen, and the unerring exactness with which\r\nevents have taken place hitherto precisely in the direction indicated by\r\nthe author, encourages us to believe that this will continue until his\r\npredictions will have been fulfilled to the end. Clear-sighted,\r\nphilosophical, appreciative of American genius and accomplishment,\r\ncritical, yet charitable to tenderness, stigmatizing the fault, yet\r\nforgiving the offender, cheering our nation onward by words of\r\nencouragement, bravely spoken at the needed-moment, menacing Europe with\r\nthe scorn of posterity, if, forgetting her oft-repeated professions, she\r\ndare forsake the side of liberty to traffic in principles; such is the\r\nscope of what a late reviewer calls \"the wisest book which has been\r\nwritten upon America since De Tocqueville.\"\r\n\r\nFew men are better qualified to judge American affairs than Count de\r\nGasparin. A many-sided man, combining the scholar, the statesman, the\r\npolitician, the man of letters, and the finished gentleman, possessed of\r\nevery advantage of culture, wealth, and position, he has devoted a long\r\nlife to the advocacy of liberty in all its forms, whether religious or\r\npolitical, and has ended by making a profound study of American history\r\nand politics, the accuracy of which is truly remarkable. A few facts\r\nwith respect to his career, kindly furnished by his personal friend,\r\nRev. Dr. Robert Baird, of New York, will be here in place.\r\n\r\nCount Agénor Étiénne de Gasparin was born at Orange, July 4, 1810. His\r\nfamily is Protestant, and of Corsican origin; his father was a man of\r\ntalent and position, who served for many years as Prefect of the\r\nDistrict of the Rhone, and afterwards as Minister of the Interior under\r\nLouis Philippe, by whom he was highly esteemed. He received a liberal\r\neducation, and devoted himself especially to literature, till 1842, when\r\nhe was elected by the people of the island of Corsica to represent them\r\nin the Chamber of Deputies. Here began his political career. At that\r\ntime, religious liberty was in danger of perishing in France, assailed\r\nby the powerful opposition of the tribunals and the administration. De\r\nGasparin declared himself its champion, and, in an eloquent speech in\r\nthe Chamber of Deputies, which moved the audience to tears, he boldly\r\naccused the courts of perverting the civil code in favor of religious\r\nintolerance, and claimed unlimited freedom for evangelical preaching and\r\ncolportage. He also made strenuous efforts to effect the immediate\r\nemancipation of slaves in the French colonies, and published several\r\nessays on the subject. He devoted himself especially to the protection\r\nof Protestantism, and founded in France the Society for the Protection\r\nof Protestant interests, and the Free Protestant Church, yet, detesting\r\nreligious intolerance everywhere, he did not hesitate to denounce the\r\nProtestant persecutions of Sweden as bitterly as he had done the\r\nCatholic bigotry of France. He was head of the Cabinet in the Ministry\r\nof the Interior while his father was Minister, and was in the Ministry\r\nof Public Instruction under M. Guizot. In 1848, while travelling in the\r\nEast with his wife, a talented Swiss lady, the author of several works,\r\nhe received intelligence of the downfall of the government of Louis\r\nPhilippe. This event closed his public career. He addressed a letter of\r\ncondolence to the dethroned monarch, to whom he was warmly attached,\r\nthen retired to Switzerland to devote himself to literature and\r\nphilanthropy, being too warm an adherent of the Orleans dynasty to take\r\npart in the new administration. Politically, he is, like Guizot, an\r\nadvocate of constitutional monarchy. Since the Revolution, he has\r\ncontinued to reside in Switzerland. He has published numerous works on\r\nphilosophical and social questions, among which may be instanced:\r\n_Esclavage et Traite; De l'Affranchissement des Esclaves; Intérêts\r\ngénéraux du Protestantisme Français, Paganismet Christianisme, Des\r\ntables tournantes, du surnaturel en général, et des esprits_, etc.\r\n\r\nHis present work, so hopeful and sympathizing, recommends itself to the\r\nattention of the American public; and even those who may dissent from\r\nsome of his positions or conclusions, cannot but admire his vigorous\r\ncomprehension of the outlines of the subject, and be cheered by his\r\npredictions of the future. As the expression of the opinion of an\r\nintelligent, clear-sighted European, in a position to comprehend men and\r\nthings, concerning the storm which is now agitating the whole country,\r\nit can scarcely fail of a hearty welcome. I commend the following\r\ninterpretation, which I have sought to make as conscientiously literal\r\nas due regard to idioms of language would permit, to all true lovers of\r\nliberty and of the Union, of whatever State, section, or nation.\r\n\r\nMARY L. BOOTH.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, _June_ 15, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn publishing this study at the present time, I expose myself to the\r\nblame of prudent men. I shall be told that I ought to have waited.\r\n\r\nTo have waited for what? Until there shall be no more great questions in\r\nEurope to dispute our attention with the American question? Or until the\r\nAmerican question has shaped itself, and we are able to know clearly\r\nwhat interests it will serve, in what consequences it will end?\r\n\r\nI am not sorry, I confess, to applaud duty before it is recommended by\r\nsuccess. When success shall have come, men eager to celebrate it will\r\nnot be wanting, and I shall leave to them the care of demonstrating then\r\nthat the North has been in the right, that it has saved the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nTo construct the philosophy of events after they have passed is very\r\ninteresting, without doubt, but the work to be accomplished to-day is\r\nfar more serious. The point in question is to sustain our friends when\r\nthey are in need of us; when their battle, far from being won, is\r\nscarcely begun; the point in question is to give our support--the very\r\nconsiderable support of European opinion--at the time when it can be of\r\nservice; the point in question is to assume our small share of\r\nresponsibility in one of the gravest conflicts of this age.\r\n\r\nLet us enlist; for the Slave States, on their part, are losing no time.\r\nThey have profited well, I must admit, by the advantages assured to them\r\nby the complicity of the ministers of Mr. Buchanan. In the face of the\r\ninevitable indecision of a new government, around which care had been\r\ntaken to accumulate in advance every impossibility of acting, the\r\ndecided bearing of the extreme South, its airs of audacity and defiance\r\nhave had a certain éclat and a certain success. Already its partisans\r\nraise their heads; they dare speak in its favor among us; they insult\r\nfree trade, by transforming it into an argument destined to serve the\r\ninterests of slavery. And shall we remain mute? Shall we listen to the\r\ncounsels of that false wisdom that always comes too late, so much does\r\nit fear to declare itself too early? Shall we not feel impelled to show\r\nin all its true light the sacred cause of liberty? Ah! I declare that\r\nthe blood boils in my veins; I have hastened and would gladly have\r\nhastened still more. Circumstances independent of my will alone have\r\nretarded a publication prepared more than a month ago.\r\n\r\nORANGE, _March_ 19, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n        INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n    I.--AMERICAN SLAVERY\r\n\r\n   II.--WHERE THE NATION WAS DRIFTING BEFORE THE ELECTION OF MR.

The general\r\nopinion is that the United States continued to pursue an upward course\r\nuntil the election of Mr. Lincoln, and that since then they have been\r\ndeclining. It is not difficult, and it is very necessary, to show that\r\nthis opinion is absolutely false. Before the recent victory of the\r\nadversaries of slavery, the American Confederation, in spite of its\r\nexternal progress and its apparent prosperity, was suffering from a\r\nfearful malady which had well-nigh proved mortal; now, an operation has\r\ntaken place, the sufferings have increased, the gravity of the situation\r\nis revealed for the first time, perhaps, to inattentive eyes. Does this\r\nmean that the situation was not grave when it did not appear so? Does\r\nthis mean that we must deplore a violent crisis which alone can bring\r\nthe cure?\r\n\r\nI do not deplore it--I admire it. I recognize in this energetic\r\nreaction against the disease, the moral vigor of a people habituated to\r\nthe laborious struggles of liberty. The rising of a people is one of the\r\nrarest and most marvellous prodigies presented by the annals of\r\nhumanity. Ordinarily, nations that begin to decline, decline constantly\r\nmore and more; a rare power of life is needed to retrieve their\r\nposition, and stop in its course a decay once begun.\r\n\r\nWe have a strange way of seconding the generous enterprise into which\r\nthe United States have entered with so much courage! We prophesy to them\r\nnothing but misfortunes; we almost tell them that they have ceased to\r\nexist; we give them to understand, that in electing Mr. Lincoln they\r\nhave renounced their greatness; that they have precipitated themselves\r\nhead foremost into an abyss; that they have ruined their prosperity,\r\nsacrificed their future, rendered henceforth impossible the magnificent\r\ncharacter which was reserved to them. Mr. Buchanan, we seem to say, is\r\nthe last President of the Union.\r\n\r\nThis, thank God, is the reverse of the truth. But lately, indeed, the\r\nUnited States were advancing to their ruin; but lately there was reason\r\nto mourn in thinking of them; the steps might have been counted which\r\nit remained for them to take to complete the union of their destiny with\r\nthat of an accursed and perishable institution--an institution which\r\ncorrupts and destroys every thing with which it comes in contact.\r\nTo-day, new prospects are opening to them; they will have to combat, to\r\nlabor, to suffer; the crime of a century is not repaired in a day; the\r\nright path when long forsaken is not found again without effort; guilty\r\ntraditions and old complicities are not broken through without\r\nsacrifices. It is none the less true, notwithstanding, that the hour of\r\neffort and of sacrifice, grievous as it may be, is the very hour of\r\ndeliverance. The election of Mr. Lincoln will be one of the great dates\r\nof American history; it closes the past, but it opens the future. With\r\nit is about to commence, if the same spirit be maintained, and if\r\nexcessive concessions do not succeed in undoing all that has been done,\r\na new era, at once purer and greater than that which has just ended.\r\n\r\nLet others accuse me of optimism; I willingly agree to it. I believe\r\nthat optimism is often right here below. We need hope; we need sometimes\r\nto receive good news; we need to see sometimes the bright side of\r\nthings. The bright side is often the true side; if Love is blindfolded,\r\nI see a triple bandage on the eyes of Hate. Kindliness has its\r\nprivileges; and I do not think myself in a worse position than another\r\nto judge the United States because they inspire me with an earnest\r\nsympathy; because, after having mourned their faults and trembled at\r\ntheir perils, I have joyfully saluted the noble and manly policy of\r\nwhich the election of Mr. Lincoln is the symptom. Is it not true, that\r\nat the first news we all seemed to breathe a whiff of pure and free air\r\nfrom the other side of the ocean?\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasure, in times like ours, to feel that certain principles\r\nstill live; that they will be obeyed, cost what it may; that questions\r\nof conscience can yet sometimes weigh down questions of profit. The\r\nabolition of slavery will be, I have always thought, the principal\r\nconquest of the nineteenth century. This will be its recommendation in\r\nthe eyes of posterity, and the chief compensation for many of its\r\nweaknesses. As for us old soldiers of emancipation, who have not ceased\r\nto combat for it for twenty years and more, at the tribunal and\r\nelsewhere, we shall be excused without doubt for seeing in the triumph\r\nof our American friends something else than a subject of lamentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN SLAVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf they had not triumphed, do you know who would have gained the\r\nvictory? Slavery is only a word--a vile word, doubtless, but to which we\r\nin time become habituated. To what do we not become habituated? We have\r\nstores of indulgence and indifference for the social iniquities which\r\nhave found their way into the current of cotemporary civilization, and\r\nwhich can invoke prescription. So we have come to speak of American\r\nslavery with perfect sang froid. We are not, therefore, to stop at the\r\nword, but to go straight to the thing; and the thing is this:\r\n\r\nEvery day, in all the Southern States, families are sold at retail: the\r\nfather to one, the mother to another, the son to a third, the young\r\ndaughter to a fourth; and the father, the mother, the children, are\r\nscattered to the four winds of heaven; these hearts are broken, these\r\npoor beings are given a prey to infamy and sorrow, these marriages are\r\nruptured, and adulterous unions are formed twenty leagues, a hundred\r\nleagues away, in the bosom and with the assent of a Christian community.\r\nEvery day, too, the domestic slave-trade carries on its work; merchants\r\nin human flesh ascend the Mississippi, to seek in the _producing_ States\r\nwherewith to fill up the vacuum caused unceasingly by slavery in the\r\n_consuming_ States; their ascent made, they scour the farms of Virginia\r\nor of Kentucky, buying here a boy, there a girl; and other hearts are\r\ntorn, other families are dispersed, other nameless crimes are\r\naccomplished coolly, simply, legally: it is the necessary revenue of the\r\none, it is the indispensable supply of the others. Must not the South\r\nlive, and how dares any one travesty a fact so simple? by what right was\r\npenned that eloquent calumny called \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\"?\r\n\r\nA calumny! I ask how any one would set to work to calumniate the customs\r\nwhich I have just described. Say, then, that the laws of the South are a\r\ncalumny, that the official acts of the South are a calumny; for I affirm\r\nthat the simple reading of these acts and these laws, a glance at the\r\nadvertisements of a Southern journal, saddens the heart more, and\r\nwounds the conscience deeper, than the most poignant pages of Mrs.\r\nHarriet Beecher Stowe. I admit willingly that there are many masters who\r\nare very kind and very good. I admit that there are some slaves who are\r\nrelatively happy. I cast aside unhesitatingly the stories of exceptional\r\ncruelty; it is enough for me to see that these _happy_ slaves expose\r\nthemselves to a thousand deaths to escape a situation declared\r\n\"preferable to that of our workmen.\" It is enough for me to hear the\r\nheart-rending cries of those women and young girls who, adjudged to the\r\nhighest and last bidder, become, by the law and in a Christian country,\r\nthe property, yes, the property (excuse the word, it is the true one) of\r\nthe debauchees, their purchasers. And remark here that the virtues of\r\nthe master are a weak guarantee: he may die, he may become bankrupt, and\r\nnothing then can hinder his slaves from being sold into the hands of the\r\nbuyer who scours the country and makes his choice.\r\n\r\nWe should calumniate the South if we amused ourselves by making a\r\ncollection of atrocious deeds, in the same manner that we should\r\ncalumniate France by seeking in the _Police Gazette_ for the description\r\nof her social state. There is, notwithstanding, this difference between\r\nthe iniquities of slavery and our own: the first are almost always\r\nunpunished, while the second are repressed by the courts. An institution\r\nwhich permits evil, creates it in a great measure: in saying that men\r\nare things, it necessarily engenders more crimes, more acts of violence,\r\nmore cowardly deeds, than the imagination of romancers will ever invent.\r\nWhen a class has neither the right to complain, nor to defend itself,\r\nnor to testify in law; when it cannot make its voice heard in any\r\nmanner, we may be excused for not taking in earnest the idyls chanted on\r\nits felicity. We must be ignorant at once of the heart of man and of\r\nhistory to preserve the slightest doubt on this point. I add that those\r\nwho, like me, have had in their hands the documents of our colonial\r\nslavery, have become terribly suspicious, and are likely to look with a\r\nskeptical eye on these Arcadian descriptions, the worth of which they\r\ncan appreciate.\r\n\r\nOnce more, I do not contest the humanity of many masters, but I remember\r\nthat there were humane masters too in Martinique, Guadeloupe, and\r\nBourbon; yet this did not prevent the discovery, on a rigid scrutiny,\r\nsometimes of excesses, as fearful as inevitable, of the discretionary\r\npower; at others, of a systematic depravation, and this to such a point\r\nthat in one of our colonies the custom of regular unions had become\r\nabsolutely unknown to the slaves.\r\n\r\nI cannot help believing that man is the same everywhere. Never, in any\r\ntime or in any latitude, has it been given him to possess his fellow,\r\nwithout fearful misfortunes having resulted to both. Have we not heard\r\ncelebrated the delightful mildness of Spanish slavery in Cuba?\r\nTravellers entertained by the Creoles usually return enchanted with it.\r\nYet, notwithstanding, it is found that on quitting the cities and\r\npenetrating into the plantations, the most barbarous system of labor is\r\ndiscovered that exists in the entire world. Cuba devours her black\r\npopulation so rapidly that she is unceasingly obliged to purchase\r\nnegroes from abroad; and these, being once on the island, have not\r\nbefore them an average life exceeding ten years! In the United States,\r\nthe planters of the extreme South are also obliged to renew their supply\r\nof negroes; but, as they have recourse to the domestic instead of the\r\nAfrican trade, and as the domestic trade furnishes slaves at an\r\nexcessively high price, it follows that motives of interest oppose the\r\nadoption of the destructive system of Cuba. Other higher motives also\r\noppose it, I am certain; and I am far from comparing the system of\r\nLouisiana or the Carolinas to that which prevails in the Spanish island.\r\nWe exaggerate nothing, however; and whatever may be the points of\r\ndifference, we may hold it as certain that those of resemblance are\r\nstill more numerous: the tree is the same, it cannot but bear the same\r\nfruits.\r\n\r\nIt must be affirmed, besides, that slavery is peculiarly odious on that\r\nsoil where the equality of mankind has been inscribed with so much eclat\r\nat the head of a celebrated constitution. Liberty imposes obligations;\r\nthere is at the bottom of the human conscience something which will\r\nalways cause slavery to be more scandalous at Washington than at Havana.\r\nWhat happens in the United States will be denounced more violently, more\r\nloudly, than what happens in Brazil; and this is right.\r\n\r\nThis said, I pause: I have not the slightest wish to introduce here a\r\nperfectly superfluous discussion on the principle and the consequences\r\nof slavery. I know all with which Americans reproach us Europeans. It\r\nwas we, Frenchmen, Englishmen, Spaniards, Hollanders, who imposed on\r\nthem this institution which we take delight in combating--this\r\ninheritance which we anathematize! Before attacking slavery, we would\r\ndo well to turn our attention to our own crimes--to the oppression of\r\nthe weak in our manufactories, for instance! But these retaliatory\r\narguments have the fault of proving nothing at all. We will leave them;\r\nwe have said enough on the nature of American slavery; let us proceed to\r\nthe special subject of our work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nWHERE THE UNITED STATES WERE DRIFTING BEFORE THE ELECTION OF MR. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the great perils which the United States encountered\r\nbefore the election of Mr. Lincoln. The time has come to enter into some\r\ndetails in justification of this proposition, which must have appeared\r\nstrange at first sight, but the terms of which I have weighed well: if\r\nthe slavery party had again achieved a victory, the United States would\r\nhave gone to ruin. Here are the facts:\r\n\r\nFormerly, there was but one opinion among Americans on the subject of\r\nslavery. The Southerners may have considered it as a necessary evil; in\r\nany case, they considered it as an evil. Carolina herself nobly resisted\r\nits introduction upon her soil; other colonies did the same. Washington\r\ninscribed the wish in his will that so baleful an institution might be\r\npromptly suppressed. To pen up slavery, to prevent its extension, to\r\nreduce it to the _rôle_ of a local and temporary fact, which it was\r\ndetermined to restrain still more--such was the sentiment which\r\nprevailed in the South, as in the North. And, in fact, slavery was ere\r\nlong abolished in the majority of the States composing the Union.\r\nTo-day, slavery has become a beneficent, evangelical institution, the\r\ncorner-stone of republics, the foundation of all liberties; it has\r\nbecome a source of blessings for the blacks as for the whites. We not\r\nonly are not to think of reducing the number of slave States, but it\r\nbecomes important to increase them unceasingly: to interdict to slavery\r\nthe entrance into a new territory is almost iniquitous. Such are the\r\ntheories proclaimed by the governors, by the legislators of the cotton\r\nStates; they propose them openly, without scruple and without\r\ncircumlocution, under the name of political--what do I say? of moral and\r\nChristian axioms. For these theories they take fire, they become\r\nexcited; they feel that enthusiasm which was inspired in other times by\r\nthe love of liberty. See entire populations, who, under the eye of God,\r\nand invoking his support, devote themselves, body, soul, and goods, to\r\nthe _holy_ cause of slavery, its conquests, its indefinite extension,\r\nits inter-State and African trade.\r\n\r\nAnd the conquests of slavery do not figure only in platforms; they are\r\npursued and accomplished effectively on the soil of America. In the face\r\nof the nineteenth century, free Texas has been transformed into a slave\r\nState. To create other slave countries is the aim proposed; and slave\r\ncountries multiply, and the South does not tolerate the slightest\r\nobstacle to conquests of this kind, and it goes forward, and nothing\r\nstops it--I am wrong, the election of Mr. Lincoln has stopped it, and\r\nthis is why its fury breaks out to-day.\r\n\r\nOne would he furious for less cause! Every thing had gone so well till\r\nthen! The South spoke as a master, and the North humbly bowed its head\r\nbefore its imperious commands. Its exactions increased from day to day,\r\nand it was not difficult to see to what abysses it was leading the\r\nentire American Union. Shall we give our readers an idea of this\r\ncrescendo of pretensions?\r\n\r\nWe will content ourselves with going back to the last Mexican war and to\r\nthe Wilmot proviso. This was, as is known, a measure, or _proviso_,\r\nstipulating that slavery could not be introduced into conquered\r\nprovinces. Such was the starting point. It was sought then, in 1847, to\r\nprevent the territorial extension of slavery. This seems to me\r\nreasonable enough; and I am not astonished that the Lincoln platform\r\ntends simply to return to this primitive policy. The measure passes the\r\nHouse of Representatives, but is defeated in the Senate.\r\nNotwithstanding, the American people hold firm to the principle that\r\nslavery shall henceforth no longer be extended; it elects, in 1848, the\r\nupright Administration of Gen. Taylor. The cause of justice seems about\r\nto triumph, when the death of the whig President, succeeded by the\r\nfeeble Mr. Fillmore, comes to restore good fortune to the Southerners,\r\nthe _proviso_ is forgotten, and the nation, weary of resistance, ends by\r\nadopting a series of deplorable compromises.\r\n\r\nBeginning from this moment, the progress of the evil is rapid. Among the\r\ncompromises, the oldest and most respected, dating back to 1820, was\r\nthat which bore the name of the _Missouri Compromise_. On admitting\r\nMissouri as a Slave State, it had been stipulated that slavery should be\r\nno longer introduced north of the 36th degree of latitude. Of this\r\nlimit, so long accepted, the South now complains; it is no longer\r\nwilling that the development of its \"peculiar institution\" shall be\r\nobstructed in any thing. Other combats, another victory. A bill\r\nproposed by Mr. Douglas annuls the Missouri Compromise, and, based on\r\nthe principle of local sovereignties, withdraws from Congress the right\r\nto interfere in the question of slavery.\r\n\r\nThe Wilmot proviso could not subsist in the presence of these absolute\r\npretensions. The liberty of slavery (pardon me this mournful and\r\ninvoluntary conjunction) finds an application on the spot. At this\r\njuncture, Texas, a province detached from Mexico, is admitted in the\r\nquality of a slave State.\r\n\r\nWhat happens then? The partisans of slavery, hampered by nothing any\r\nlonger, either by limits at the North, or limits at the South, or\r\nprovisos, or compromises, encounter, to their great horror, an obstacle\r\nof quite a different nature. The local sovereignty which they have\r\ninvoked turns against them; in the Territory of Kansas, the majority\r\nvotes the exclusion of slavery. At once the Southerners change theory;\r\nagainst local sovereignty they invoke the central power; they demand,\r\nthey exact that the decisions of the majority in Kansas shall be trodden\r\nunder foot; they put forward the natural right of slavery. Why shall\r\nthey be prevented from settling in a Territory with the slaves, their\r\nproperty? When this Territory shall be by and by transformed into a\r\nState, there will doubtless be a right to determine the question; but to\r\nabolish slavery is quite a different thing from excluding it.\r\n\r\nIf the South did not win the cause this time, it was not the fault of\r\nthe government of the United States, but of the inhabitants of Kansas.\r\nAs for Mr. Buchanan, he showed himself what he has constantly been, the\r\nmost humble servant of the slavery party. They came together into\r\ncollision with _squatter sovereignty:_ they found for the first time in\r\ntheir path that solid resistance of the West which was manifested in the\r\nlast election, and which, I firmly hope, is about to save America. But\r\nin the mean time, they had taken a new step forward--a formidable step,\r\nand one which introduced them into the very bosom of the free States:\r\nthey had obtained a decision from the Supreme Court--the Dred Scott\r\ndecree. In the preamble of this too celebrated decision, the highest\r\njudicial power of the Confederation did not fear to proclaim two\r\nprinciples: first, that there is no difference between a slave and any\r\nother kind of property; secondly, that all American citizens may settle\r\neverywhere with their property.\r\n\r\nWhat a menace for the free-soilers! How easy to see to what lengths the\r\nSouth would shortly go! Since slavery constituted property like any\r\nother, it was necessary to prohibit the majority from proscribing it in\r\nStates as well as in Territories. Who knew whether we should not some\r\nday see slaves and even slave-markets (the right of property carries\r\nwith it that of sale) in the streets even of Philadelphia or Boston!\r\n\r\nLet no one cry out against this: those who demanded and those who framed\r\nthe Dred Scott decision knew probably what they wished to do. With the\r\nright of property understood in this wise, no State has the power either\r\nto vote the real abolition of slavery, or to forbid the introduction of\r\nslaves, or to refuse their extradition. And, effectively, horrible laws,\r\nordering fugitive slaves to be given up, were accorded to the violent\r\ndemands of the South. Liberty by contact with the soil, that great maxim\r\nof our Europe, was interdicted America; the very States that most\r\ndetested slavery were condemned to assist, indignant and shuddering, in\r\nthe federal invasion of a sheriff entering their homes to lay hands on a\r\npoor negro, who had believed in their hospitality, and who was about to\r\nbe delivered up to the whip of the planter.\r\n\r\nIt was asking much of the patience of the North; yet, notwithstanding,\r\nthis patience was not yet at an end. The Administration was given up a\r\nprey to the will of the Southerners. On their prohibition, the mails\r\nceased to carry books, journals, letters, which excited their suspicion.\r\nThey had seized upon the policy of the Union, and they ruled it\r\naccording to their liking. No one has forgotten those enterprises,\r\nfavored underhand, then disavowed after failure, those filibustering\r\nexpeditions in Central America and in the islands of Cuba. They were the\r\npolicy of the South, executed by Mr. Buchanan with his accustomed\r\ndocility. The point in question was to make conquests, and conquests for\r\nslavery. By any means, and at any price, the South was to procure new\r\nStates. Cuba would furnish some, several would be carved out of Mexico\r\nand Central America; for otherwise the slavery majorities would be\r\ncompromised in Congress, and slavery would be forced to renounce forever\r\nthe election of the Presidents of free America. To avoid such a\r\nmisfortune, there is nothing that they would not have been ready to\r\nundertake.\r\n\r\nThus, step after step, and exaction after exaction, overthrowing, one\r\nafter the other, all barriers, the Wilmot proviso, the Missouri\r\nCompromise, the right of majorities in the Territories, the very\r\nsovereignty of the States annulled by the Dred Scott decision, the South\r\nhad succeeded in drawing the United States into those violent and\r\ndishonest political practices which filled the administration of Mr.\r\nBuchanan. The barriers of public probity, and the right of men, yielded\r\nin turn; the administration dared write officially that Cuba was\r\nnecessary to the United States, and that the affranchisement of slaves\r\nin Cuba would be a legitimate cause of war. The United States were yoked\r\nto the car of slavery: to make slave States, to conquer Territories for\r\nslavery, to prevent the terrible misfortune of an abolition of slavery,\r\nsuch was the programme. In negotiations, in elections, nothing else was\r\nperceived than this. If the liberty of the seas and the independence of\r\nthe flag were proudly claimed, it was by the order of the South, and\r\nthere resulted thence, whether desired or not, a progressive\r\nresurrection of the African slave-trade; if candidates in favor of the\r\nmaintenance of the Union were recommended, it was to assure the\r\nconquests of slavery within and without, the invasion of neighboring\r\ncountries, the extradition of fugitive slaves, the subjugation of\r\nmajorities rebellious to the South, the suppression of laws disagreeable\r\nto the South, the overthrow of the last obstacles which fettered the\r\nprogress of the South.\r\n\r\nAnd it was thus far, to this degree of disorder and abasement, that a\r\nnoble people had been dragged downwards in the course of years, sinking\r\nconstantly deeper, abandoning, one by one, its guarantees, losing its\r\ntitles to the esteem of other nations, approaching the abyss, seeing the\r\nhour draw nigh in which to rise would be impossible, bringing down\r\nmaledictions upon itself, forcing those who love it to reflect on the\r\nwords of one of its most illustrious leaders: \"I tremble for my country,\r\nwhen I remember that God is just!\"\r\n\r\nAll this under the tyrannical and pitiless influence of a minority\r\nconstantly transformed into a majority! Picture to yourself a man on a\r\nvessel standing by the gun-room with a lighted match, in his hand; he is\r\nalone, but the rest obey him, for at the first disobedience he will blow\r\nup himself with all the crew. This is precisely what has been going on\r\nin America since she went adrift. The working of the ship was commanded\r\nby the man who held the match. \"At the first disobedience, we will quit\r\nyou.\" Such has always been the language of the Southern States. They\r\nwere known to be capable of keeping their word; therefore, there ceased\r\nto be but one argument in America: secession. \"Revoke the compromise, or\r\nelse secession; modify the legislation of the free States, or else\r\nsecession; risk adventures, and undertake conquests with us for slavery,\r\nor else secession; lastly and above all, never suffer yourselves to\r\nelect a president who is not our candidate, or else secession.\"\r\n\r\nThus spoke the South, and the North submitted. Let us not be unduly\r\nsurprised at it, there was patriotism in this weakness; many citizens,\r\ninimical to slavery, forbore to combat its progress, in order to avoid\r\nwhat appeared to them a greater evil. Declivities like these are\r\ndescended quickly, and the deplorable presidency of Mr. Buchanan stands\r\nto testify to this. The policy of the United States had become doubtful;\r\ntheir good renown was dwindling away even with their warmest friends;\r\ntheir cause was becoming blended more and more with that of servitude;\r\ntheir liberties were compromised, and the Federal institutions were\r\nbending before the \"institution\" of the South; no more rights of the\r\nmajority before the \"institution;\" no more sovereignty of the States\r\nbefore the \"institution.\" The ultra policy of Mr. Buchanan had coveted\r\nCuba, essayed violence in Kansas, given up the government of America in\r\nfine to a cabinet of such a stamp, that a majority was nearly found in\r\nit, ready to disavow Major Anderson, and to order the evacuation of\r\nforts of the Confederation, menaced by Carolinian forces.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, an incredible fact had come to light. It was one of\r\nthe glories of America to have abolished the African slave trade before\r\nany other nation, and even to have put it on the same footing with the\r\ncrime of piracy. The South had openly demanded the re-establishment of a\r\ncommerce which alone could furnish it at some day with the number of\r\nnegroes proportioned to its vast designs. What had Mr. Buchanan done? He\r\ndoubtless had not consented officially to an enormity which Congress, on\r\nits part, would not have tolerated; but repression had become so lax\r\nunder his administration, that the number of slave ships fitted out in\r\nthe ports of the United States had at length become very considerable.\r\nThe port of New York alone, which participates but too much in the\r\nmisdeeds and tendencies of the South, fitted out eighty-five slavers\r\nbetween the months of February, 1859, and July, 1860. These slavers\r\nproudly bore the United States' flag over the seas, and defied the\r\nEnglish cruisers. As for the American cruisers, Mr. Buchanan had taken\r\ncare to remove them all from Cuba, where every one knows that the living\r\ncargoes are landed. The slave trade is therefore in the height of\r\nprosperity, whatever the last presidential message may say of it, and as\r\nto the application of the laws concerning piracy, I do not see that they\r\nhave had many victims.\r\n\r\nWe can now measure the perils which menaced the United States. It was\r\nnot such or such a measure in particular, but a collection of measures,\r\nall directed towards the same end, and tending mutually to complete each\r\nother: conquests, the domestic and the foreign slave trade, the\r\noverthrow of the few barriers opposed to the extension of slavery, the\r\ndebasement of institutions, the definitive enthroning of an adventurous\r\npolicy, a policy without principles and without scruples; to this the\r\ncountry was advancing with rapid strides. Do they who raise their hands\r\nand eyes to heaven, because the election of Mr. Lincoln has caused the\r\nbreaking forth of an inevitable crisis, fancy then that the crisis would\r\nhave been less serious if it had broken forth four years later, when the\r\nevil would have been without remedy? Already, the five hundred thousand\r\nslaves of the last century have given place to four millions; was it\r\nadvisable to wait until there were twenty millions, and until vast\r\nterritories, absorbed by American power, had been peopled by blacks torn\r\nfrom Africa? Was it advisable to await the time when the South should\r\nhave become decidedly the most important part of the Confederation, and\r\nwhen the North, forced to secede, should have left to others the name,\r\nthe prestige, the flag of the United States? Do they fancy that, by\r\nchance, with the supremacy of the South, with its conquests, with the\r\nmonstrous development of its slavery, secession would have been avoided?\r\nNo! it would have appeared some day as a necessary fact; only it would\r\nhave been accomplished under different auspices and in different\r\nconditions. Such a secession would have been death, a shameful death.\r\n\r\nAnd slavery itself, who imagines, then, that it can be immortal? It is\r\nin vain to extend it; it will perish amidst its conquests and through\r\nits conquests: one can predict this without being a prophet. But,\r\nbetween the suppression of slavery such as we hope will some time take\r\nplace, and that which we should have been forced to fear, in case the\r\nSouth had carried it still further, is the distance which separates a\r\nhard crisis from a terrible catastrophe. The South knows not what\r\nnameless misfortunes it has perhaps just escaped. If it had been so\r\nunfortunate as to conquer, if it had been so unfortunate as to carry out\r\nits plans, to create slave States, to recruit with negroes from Africa,\r\nit would have certainly paved the way, with its own hands, for one of\r\nthose bloody disasters before which the imagination recoils: it would\r\nhave shut itself out from all chance of salvation.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible, in truth, to put an end to certain crimes, and\r\nwholly avoid their chastisement; there will always be some suffering in\r\ndelivering the American Confederation from slavery, and it depends\r\nto-day again upon the South to aggravate, in a fearful measure, the pain\r\nof the transition. However, what would not have been possible with the\r\nelection of Mr. Douglas or Mr. Breckenridge, has become possible now\r\nwith the election of Mr. Lincoln; we are at liberty to hope henceforth\r\nfor the rising of a great people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nWHAT THE ELECTION OF MR. LINCOLN SIGNIFIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think that I have justified the fundamental idea of this work, and the\r\ntitle which I have given it. If the slavery policy had achieved a new\r\ntriumph; if the North had not elected its President, the first that has\r\nbelonged to it in full since the existence of the Confederation; if\r\nsupremacy had not ranged itself in fine on the side with force and\r\njustice, this unstable balance would have had its hour of downfall: and\r\nwhat a downfall! Of so much true liberty, of so much progress, of so\r\nmany noble examples, what would have been left standing? The secession\r\nof the South is not the secession of the North; affranchisement with\r\nfour millions of slaves is not affranchisement with twenty millions; the\r\ncrisis of 1861 is not that of 1865 or of 1869. The United States, I\r\nrepeat, with a profound and studied conviction,--the United States have\r\njust been saved.\r\n\r\nThere are those who ask gravely whether the electors of Mr. Lincoln have\r\na plan all ready to effect the abolition of slavery. We answer that this\r\nis not in question. Among the influential and earnest men of the\r\nvictorious party, not one could be cited who would think of proposing\r\nany plan whatever of emancipation. One thing alone is proposed: to check\r\nthe conquests of slavery. That it shall not be extended, that it shall\r\nbe confined within its present limits, is all that is sought to-day. The\r\npolicy of the founders of the Confederation has become that of their\r\nsuccessors in turn; and to this policy, what can be objected? Is not the\r\nsovereignty of the States respected? do they not remain free to regulate\r\nwhat concerns them? do they not preserve the right of postponing, so\r\nlong as they deem proper, the solution of a dreaded problem? could not\r\nthis solution be thought over and prepared by those who best know its\r\nelements?\r\n\r\nThe matter is, indeed, more complicated and difficult than is generally\r\nimagined. Should we be imprudent enough to meddle with it, we might\r\nrightfully be blamed. Here, summary proceedings are evidently not\r\nadmissible. Time and the spirit of Christianity must do their work by\r\ndegrees; they will do it, be sure, provided the evil be circumscribed,\r\nprovided the seat of the conflagration be hemmed in and prevented\r\nhenceforth from spreading further.\r\n\r\nNow, such is the great result acquired by the election of Mr. Lincoln;\r\nit is nothing more than this, but it is all this: it is prudence in the\r\npresent, and it is also the certainty of success in the future.\r\nEmancipation is by no means decreed; it will not be for a long time,\r\nperhaps: yet the principle of emancipation is established, irrevocably\r\nestablished in the sight of all. Irrevocability has prodigious power\r\nover our minds: without being conscious of it, we make way for it; we\r\narrange in view of it our conduct, our plans, and even our doctrines.\r\nOnce fully convinced that its propagandism is checked, that the future\r\nof which it dreamed has no longer any chances of success, the South\r\nitself will become accustomed to consider its destiny under a wholly new\r\naspect. The border States, in which emancipation is easy, will range\r\nthemselves one after another on the side of liberty. Thus the extent of\r\nthe evil will become reduced of itself, and instead of advancing, as\r\nduring some years past, towards a colossal development of servitude, it\r\nwill proceed in the direction of its gradual attenuation.\r\n\r\nI reason on the hypothesis of a final maintenance of the Union, whatever\r\nmay be the incidents of temporary secession. I am not ignorant that\r\nthere are other hypotheses, which may possibly be realized, and which I\r\nshall examine in the course of this treatise; but whatever may happen, I\r\nhave a full right to call to mind the true scope of the vote which has\r\njust been taken. It does not involve the slightest idea of present\r\nemancipation; it contents itself with checking the progress of slavery;\r\nand to check its progress is, doubtless, to diminish the perils of its\r\nfuture abolition.\r\n\r\nIt was important to present this observation, for nothing perverts our\r\njudgment of the American crisis more than the inexact definitions which\r\nare given of abolitionism. We willingly picture abolitionists to\r\nourselves as madmen, seeking to attain their end on the spot, regardless\r\nof all else, through blood and ruin! That there may be such is possible,\r\nis even inevitable; but the men who exercise any political influence\r\nover the North have not for a moment adopted such theories. This is so\r\ntrue, that the other day, at Boston, the people themselves (the people\r\nwho nominated Mr. Lincoln) dispersed a meeting intended to discuss\r\nplans of immediate emancipation.\r\n\r\nWhat if abolitionism, moreover, be a party? what if it make use of the\r\nmeans employed by parties? what if it have its journals, its publicists,\r\nits orators? what if it seek allies? what if it be based on interests\r\nwhich may be given it by the majority? what if it appeal to the passions\r\nof the North, as the slavery party appeals to those of the South? I do\r\nnot see, in truth, why this should astonish us. I am far from believing\r\nthat all the acts of abolitionism are worthy of approbation; I say only\r\nthat it would be puerile to repudiate a great party for the sole reason\r\nthat it has the bearing of a party. The duty of citizens in a free\r\ncountry is to choose between parties, and to unite with that whose cause\r\nis just and holy. Let them protest against wrong measures, let them\r\nrefuse to participate in them--nothing can be better; but to withdraw\r\ninto a sort of political Thebais because the noblest parties have stains\r\non their banner, is, in truth, to turn their back on the civil\r\nobligations of real life.\r\n\r\nThe abolition party is a noble one. Several of its champions have given\r\ntheir lives to propagate their faith. But lately, indeed, the Texan\r\njournals took pains to tell us that a number of them had just been hung\r\nin that State; and, without even speaking of these noble victims, whose\r\ndeath completes the dishonor of the Southern cause, are there any bolder\r\ndeeds in the history of mankind than those of the citizens of New\r\nEngland who, to wrest Kansas from slavery, went thither to build their\r\ncabins, thus braving a fearful struggle, not only with the slaveholders,\r\nbut with the President, his illegal measures, and the troops charged\r\nwith maintaining them?\r\n\r\nWe must fight to conquer. This seems little understood by those who\r\nreproach abolitionism with having been a party militant; to hear them,\r\nthe true way of bringing about the abolition of slavery was to let it\r\nalone: to attack was to exasperate it.\r\n\r\nThis argument is so unfortunate as to be employed in all bad causes. I\r\nremember that when measures were taken against the slave trade, we were\r\ntold that the sufferings of the slaves would be thus increased, and that\r\nthe slavers would be _exasperated_. Later, when we held up to the\r\nindignation of the whole world the Protestant intolerance of Sweden, we\r\nwere assured that these public denunciations would put back the question\r\ninstead of accelerating it. We persevered, and we did rightly. Sweden\r\nis advancing, though at too slow a pace, towards religious liberty. It\r\nwould be difficult to cite any social iniquities that have reformed of\r\nthemselves; and, since the existence of the world, the method which\r\nconsists in attacking evil has been the one sanctioned by success. In\r\nAmerica itself, the progress made by the border States does not seem to\r\nconfirm what is told us of the reaction caused by the aggressions of\r\nabolitionism. In Virginia, in Kentucky, in Missouri, in Delaware, etc.,\r\nthe liberty party has been continually gaining ground; and the votes\r\nreceived in the slave States by Mr. Lincoln prove it a very great\r\nmistake to suppose letting alone to be the condition of progress. Would\r\nto God that slavery had not been let alone when the republic of the\r\nUnited States was founded! Then, abolition was easy, the slaves were few\r\nin number, and no really formidable antagonism was in play. Unhappily,\r\nfalse prudence made itself heard: it was resolved to keep silence, and\r\nnot to deprive the South of the honor of a voluntary emancipation--in\r\nfine, to reserve the question for the future. The future has bent under\r\nthe weight of a task which has continued to increase with years, thanks\r\nto letting it alone.\r\n\r\nA little more letting alone, and the weight would have crushed America;\r\nit was time to act. The Abolition party, or rather the party opposed to\r\nthe extension of slavery, has acted with a resolution which should\r\nexcite our sympathies. The future of the United States was at stake; it\r\nknew it, and it struggled in consequence. Remember the efforts essayed\r\nfour years ago for the election of Mr. Fremont, efforts which would have\r\nsucceeded perhaps, if Mr. Fremont had not been a Catholic. Remember\r\nthose three months of balloting, by which the North succeeded in\r\ncarrying the election of speaker of the House of Representatives.\r\nRemember the conduct of the North, in the sad affair of John Brown, its\r\nrefusal to approve an illegal act, its admiration of the heroic farmer\r\nwho died after having witnessed the death of his sons. On seeing the\r\npublic mourning of the Free States, on hearing the minute gun discharged\r\nin the capital of the State of New York on the day of execution, one\r\nmight have foreseen the irresistible impulse which has just ended in the\r\ntriumph of Mr. Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThe indignation against slavery, the love of country and of its\r\ncompromised honor, the just susceptibilities of the North, the liberal\r\ninstincts so long repressed, the desire of elevating the debased and\r\ncorrupt institutions of the land, the need of escaping insane projects,\r\nthe powerful impulse of the Christian faith, all these sentiments\r\ncontributed, without doubt, to swell the resistance against which the\r\nsupremacy of the South has just been broken. This, then, is a legal\r\nvictory, one of the most glorious spectacles that the friends of liberty\r\ncan contemplate on earth. It was the more glorious, the more efforts and\r\nsacrifices it demanded. The Lincoln party had opposed to it, the\r\nPuseyistic and financial aristocracy of New York; the manoeuvres of\r\nPresident Buchanan were united against it with those of the Southern\r\nStates. Many of the Northern journals accused it of treading under foot\r\nthe interests of the seaports, and of compromising the sacred cause of\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\nTo succeed in electing Mr. Lincoln, we must not forget that it was\r\nnecessary to put the question of principle above the questions of\r\nimmediate interests, which usually make themselves heard so distinctly.\r\nThe unity, the greatness of the country, the gigantic future towards\r\nwhich it was advancing, were so many obstacles arising in the way. Then\r\ncame the reckoning of profits and losses, the inevitable crisis, the\r\nSouthern orders already withdrawn, the certain loss of money; it seems\r\nto me that men who have braved such chances, have nobly accomplished\r\ntheir duty.\r\n\r\nAmerica, it is said, is the country of the dollar; the Americans think\r\nonly of making money, all other considerations are subordinate to this.\r\nIf the reproach is sometimes well-founded, we must admit, at least, that\r\nit is not always so. Those who wish to persuade us that the\r\nAbolitionists in this again have simply sought their own interests, by\r\nseeking to break down the competition of servile labor, forget two or\r\nthree things: first, that the slaves produce tobacco or cotton, while\r\nthe North produces wheat, so that there is not a race in the world that\r\ncompetes less with it: next, that the cotton of the South is very useful\r\nto the North, useful to its manufactures, useful to its trade, both\r\ntransit and commission. The people of the North are not reputed to lack\r\nforesight; they were not ignorant that in electing Mr. Lincoln, they\r\nhad, for the time at least, every thing to lose and nothing to gain;\r\nthey were not ignorant that Mr. Lincoln occasioned the immediate threat\r\nof secession; that the threat of secession was a commercial crisis, was\r\nthe political weakening of the country, and the unsettling of many\r\nfortunes. But neither were they ignorant that above the fleeting\r\ninterests of individuals and of the nation, arose those permanent\r\ninterests which must rest only on justice; they decided, cost what it\r\nmight, to wrest themselves from the detestable, and ere long fatal\r\nallurements of the slavery policy.\r\n\r\nLet us beware how we calumniate, without intending it, the few generous\r\nimpulses which break out here and there among mankind. I know that there\r\nis a would-be prudent skepticism which attacks all moral greatness that\r\nit may depreciate it, all enthusiasm that it may translate it into\r\ncalculation. To admire nothing is most deplorable, and, I hasten to add,\r\nmost absurd. Without wandering from the subject of slavery, I can cite\r\nthe great Emancipation Act, wrested from Parliament by Christian public\r\nopinion in England. Have not means been found to prove, or at least to\r\ninsinuate, that this act, the most glorious of our century, was at the\r\nbottom nothing but a Machiavellian combination of interests? Doubtless,\r\nthose who have taken the trouble to look over the debates of the times\r\nknow what we are to think of this fine explanation; they know what\r\nresistance was opposed by _interests_ to the emancipation, both in the\r\ncolonies and in the heart of the metropolis; they know with how much\r\nobstinacy the Tories, representing the traditions of English politics,\r\ncombated the proposed plans; they know in what terms the certain ruin of\r\nthe planters, the manufactures, and the seaports, was described; they\r\nknow by how many petitions the churches, the religious societies, the\r\nwomen, and even the children, succeeded in wresting from Parliament a\r\nmeasure refused by so many statesmen. But the mass of the people do not\r\ngo back to the beginning; they take for granted the summary judgment\r\nthat English emancipation was a master-piece of perfidy.\r\n\r\nWe hear very nearly the same thing said of that glorious movement which\r\nhas just taken place in America. We would gladly detect all motives in\r\nit except one that is generous and Christian. As if a vulgar calculation\r\nof interest would not have dictated a contrary course! And it is\r\nprecisely this that makes the greatness of the resolution adopted by the\r\nNorth. It knew all the consequences; they had been announced by the\r\nSouth, recapitulated by prudent men, stated in detail by the newspapers\r\nof great commercial cities; it chose to be just. Despite the inevitable\r\nmingling of base and selfish impulses, which always become complicated\r\nin such manifestations, the ruling motive in this was a protest of\r\nconscience, and of the spirit of liberty.\r\n\r\nThe accounts that have come to us from America demonstrate the lofty\r\ncharacter of the joy which was manifested after the election. Men shook\r\nhands with each other in the streets; they congratulated each other on\r\nhaving at last escaped from the yoke of an ignoble policy; they felt as\r\nthough relieved from a weight; they breathed more freely; the true, the\r\nnoble destinies of the United States reappeared on the horizon, they\r\nsaluted a future that should be better than the present, a future worthy\r\nof their sires, those early pilgrims who, carrying nothing with them but\r\ntheir Bibles, had laid the foundation of a free country with poor but\r\nvaliant hands.\r\n\r\nI should like to quote here the sermon in which the Rev. Mr. Beecher\r\npoured out his Christian joy at that time. He spoke of the strength of\r\nthe weak; he showed that principles, however despised they may be, end\r\nby revenging themselves on interests; he recalled the fact that the\r\nGospel is a power in America. To rise up, to attack its enemy manfully,\r\nto arraign the causes of the national decline, to approach boldly the\r\nsolution of the most formidable problem which could be propounded here\r\non earth, such is not the act of a nation of calculators. Something\r\nelse is implied in it than tactics, something else than combinations of\r\nvotes or sectional rivalries. To vote as they did, they had to overcome\r\nalmost as many obstacles in the North as in the South; for, in\r\nconsequence of the vote, the North had to suffer like the South, and\r\nthey knew it.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to be just to the United States, compare them with other\r\ncountries in which slavery exists. In the United States there is a\r\nstruggle; the question is a living one; men do not turn aside from it\r\nwith lax indifference. I love the noise of free nations; I find in the\r\nvery violence of their debates a proof of the earnestness of\r\nconvictions. Men must become excited about great social problems; if\r\nabuses exist, they must, at least, be pointed out, attacked, and\r\nstigmatized; the prescription of silence must never be accorded them;\r\ndevoted voices must exclaim against them, unceasingly, in the name of\r\njustice and of humanity. Such a spectacle does good to the soul; it\r\nsolaces the sorrows of the present, it carries within itself guarantees\r\nfor the future.\r\n\r\nThe sad, profoundly sad, spectacle, is that of nations where crimes make\r\nno noise. Look at Brazil. Like the United States, it has slavery, but it\r\nis an honorable, discreet slavery, of which nothing is said. Whatever\r\nmay happen there, no one inquires about it; there are no discussions,\r\neither through the press or in the courts. No party would dare insert\r\nsuch a question into its platform. One thing, very properly, has been\r\nfound to disturb it, and the public sale of slaves has just been\r\nforbidden.\r\n\r\nLook, above all, at Spain and its island of Cuba. There, too, is perfect\r\nsilence. Nothing, in truth, opposes the belief that Cuba is the abode of\r\nfelicity, and that the atrocities of slavery are the monopoly of the\r\nUnited States. But inquisitive people, who like to search to the bottom\r\nof things, discover that if the masters are very gentle at Havana, the\r\noverseers are scarcely so on their account on the plantations; I have\r\nalready given the proof of it. Out of ten slavers that are seized on the\r\nhigh seas, nine are always destined to Cuba. Spain has forbidden the\r\nslave trade; she has even been compensated for it by the English; but\r\nthis does not prevent her from suffering it to be carried on before her\r\neyes with almost absolute impunity. Her high-sounding phrases change\r\nnothing; the smallest fact is of more value. At Cuba, the landing of\r\nslaves is continual, and the places of disembarkation are known. Now,\r\nthe American flag protects no one at the time of disembarking. Why is no\r\nopposition made to this? Why has the importation of negroes tripled in\r\nCuba? Why does no slaver, American or any other, steer towards Brazil,\r\nsince Brazil has _desired_ to put an end to the slave trade? The answer\r\nto these questions will be given us on the day when Spain shall\r\n_desire_, in turn, to suppress it. In the mean time she prefers to keep\r\nsilence, unless when a word from London strikes out a concert of\r\nprotestations more patriotic than convincing; save in this case, the\r\ngovernment is silent, public opinion is silent, no colonial sheet is\r\nfound ready to hazard an objection, nor even a metropolitan journal that\r\nis willing to disturb so touching an equanimity. The court of Madrid, in\r\nwhich many questions are agitated, prudently stands aloof in the matter\r\nof slavery and the slave trade; among the numerous parties disputing for\r\npower, not one dares venture on a ground where it would meet nothing but\r\nunpopularity. Ah! after this death-like silence, how the soul is\r\nrefreshed by the fiery contests of the United States, the great\r\nword-combats carried on in every village of the Union, the appeals\r\naddressed to the conscience, the battle in broad daylight! How\r\nrefreshing to see by the side of these nations, who sleep so tranquilly,\r\nwhile regarding the inroads of slavery, a people whom, it disquiets,\r\nwhom it irritates, who refuse to take part in it, and who, rather than\r\nconform to the evil, agitate, become divided, and rend themselves\r\nperchance with their own hands!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nWHAT WE ARE TO THINK OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are not just towards the United States. Their civilization, so\r\ndifferent from ours, wounds us in various ways, and we turn from them in\r\nthe ill-humor excited by their real defects, without taking note enough\r\nof their eminent qualities. This country, which possesses neither\r\nchurch, nor State, nor army, nor governmental protection; this country,\r\nborn yesterday, and born under a Puritanic influence; this country,\r\nwithout past history, without monuments, separated from the Middle Ages\r\nby the double interval of centuries and beliefs; this rude country of\r\nfarmers and pioneers, has nothing fitted to please us. It has the\r\nexuberant life and the eccentricities of youth; that is, it affords to\r\nour mature experience inexhaustible subjects of blame and raillery.\r\n\r\nWe are so little inclined to admire it, that we seek in its territorial\r\nconfiguration for the essential explanation of its success. Is it so\r\ndifficult to maintain good order and liberty at home when one has\r\nimmense deserts to people, when land offers itself without stint to the\r\nlabor of man?--I do not see, for my part, that land is lacking at Buenos\r\nAyres, at Montevideo, in Mexico, or in any of the pronunciamento\r\nrepublics that cover South America. It seems to me that the Turks have\r\nroom before them, and that the Middle Ages were not suffering precisely\r\nfrom an excess of population when they presented everywhere the\r\nspectacle of anarchy and oppression.\r\n\r\nBe sure that the United States, which have something to learn of us,\r\nhave also something to teach us. Theirs is a great community, which it\r\ndoes not become us to pass by in disdain. The more it differs from our\r\nown Europe, the more necessary is impartial attention to comprehend and\r\nappreciate it. Especially is it impossible for us to form an enlightened\r\nopinion of the present crisis, unless we begin by taking into\r\nconsideration the surroundings in which it has broken out. The nature of\r\nthe struggle and its probable issue, the difficulties of the present,\r\nand the chances of the future, will be clear to us only on condition of\r\nour making a study of the United States. A few details will, therefore,\r\nbe permitted me.\r\n\r\nAmong the Yankees, the faults are on the surface. I am not one to\r\njustify Lynch law, whatever may be the necessities which exist in the\r\nFar West. Riots in the United States are cited which have performed\r\ntheir work of fire and devastation, and which no one has dared treat\r\nrigorously afterwards, for fear of incurring disgrace from the sovereign\r\npeople; but I remember, I fancy, that similar things have been seen in\r\nParis itself. We will not, therefore, lay too great stress on them.\r\n\r\nOne thing that is not seen in Paris, is, unhappily, remarked in America:\r\nthe general tendency among women to substitute masculine qualities which\r\nscarcely befit them, for the feminine qualities which constitute their\r\ngrace, their strength, and their dignity; thence results a certain\r\nsomething unpleasant and rude which does no credit to the New World. I\r\nby no means admire coarseness, and I do not admit that it is the\r\nnecessary companion of energy; the tone of the journals and of the\r\ndebates in Congress is often calculated to excite a just reprobation.\r\nThere is in the United States a levelling spirit, a jealousy of acquired\r\nsuperiority, and, above all, of inherited distinctions, which proceeds\r\nfrom the worst sentiments of the heart. What is graver still, the\r\ntender and gentle side of the human soul, such as shines forth in the\r\nGospel, appears too rarely among this people, where the Gospel,\r\nnotwithstanding, is in honor, but where the labor of a gigantic growth\r\nhas developed the active instead of the loving virtues; the Americans\r\nare cold even when good, charitable and devout.\r\n\r\nThey may love money, and often concentrate their thoughts on the means\r\nof making it; I will not contest this, although I doubt, on seeing what\r\npasses among ourselves, whether we have the right to cast the stone at\r\nthem; especially as American liberality, as I shall presently show, is\r\nof a nature to put our parsimony to shame. As to the bankrupt acts, of\r\nwhich American creditors have many times complained, nothing can justify\r\nthem; yet here again the rôle of pedagogue scarcely becomes us. If more\r\nthan one American railroad company have taken advantage of a crisis to\r\ndeclare without much dishonor, a suspension of payment, it is not proved\r\nthat these suspensions of payment must be converted into bankruptcy. If\r\nmore than one town or more than one county make the half yearly payments\r\nof their debts with reluctance, the courts always do fair justice on\r\nthis ill will; there are some countries, Russia, for instance, where\r\nthe courts do not do as much. If, in fine, at one time, a number of\r\nStates failed to keep their engagements, and a single one dared proclaim\r\nthe infamous doctrine of repudiation, all have since paid, except one\r\nState of the extreme South, Mississippi. Once more, are we sure of being\r\nin a position to reprove such misdeeds; we, whose governments, anterior\r\nto '89, made use, without much scruple, of the fall of stocks, and\r\nbankruptcies; we, whose debt, on emerging from the Revolution, took the\r\nsignificant name of _tiers consolidé?_\r\n\r\nLet us not forget that the population of the United States has increased\r\ntenfold since the close of the last century; they have received\r\nimmigrants annually, by hundreds of thousands, who have not always been\r\nthe elite of the Old World. Must not this perpetual invasion of\r\nstrangers promptly transformed into citizens, have necessarily\r\nintroduced into the decision of public affairs some elements of\r\nimmorality? I admire the honorable and religious spirit of the Americans\r\nwhich has been able to assimilate and rule to such a degree these great\r\nmasses of Irish and Germans. Few countries would have endured a like\r\nordeal as well.\r\n\r\nRemark that, in spite of all, public order is maintained without paid\r\ntroops, (Continental Europe will find it hard to credit this.)\r\nTranquillity reigns in the largest cities of the United States; respect\r\nfor the law is in every heart; great ballotings take place, millions of\r\nexcited men await the result with trembling; yet, notwithstanding, not\r\nan act of violence is committed. American riots--for some there are--are\r\ncertainly less numerous than ours; and they have the merit of not being\r\ntransformed into revolutions.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the immigrants remain, of course, in the large\r\ncities; here they come almost to make the laws, and here, too, noble\r\ncauses encounter the most opponents. Mr. Lincoln, to cite an example,\r\nreceived only a minority of suffrages in the city of New York, whilst\r\nthe unanimity of the country suffrages secured him the vote of the\r\nState. Contempt of the colored class, that crime of the North, breaks\r\nout most of all in the large cities, and particularly among\r\nagglomerations of immigrants; none are harsher to free negroes, it must\r\nbe admitted, than newly-landed Europeans who have come to seek a fortune\r\nin America.\r\n\r\nAs to crimes, they are numerous only in cities; still the criminal\r\nrecords of the United States appear somewhat full when compared with\r\nours. I know how great a part of this must be assigned to the\r\ninsufficiency of repression; in America, criminals doubtless escape\r\npunishment much oftener than among us. Notwithstanding, there is real\r\nsecurity; and a child might travel over the entire West without being\r\nexposed to the slightest danger.\r\n\r\nM. de Tocqueville has said that morals are infinitely more rigid in\r\nNorth America than elsewhere. This is not, it seems to me, a trifling\r\nadvantage. Whatever may be the depravity of the seaports, where the\r\nwhole world holds rendezvous, it remains certain that it does not\r\npenetrate into the interior of the country. Open the journals and novels\r\nof the United States; you will not find a corrupt page in them. You\r\nmight leave them all on the drawing-room table, without fearing to call\r\na blush to the brow of a woman, or to sully the imagination of a child.\r\n\r\nIn the heart of the manufacturing States, model villages are found, in\r\nwhich every thing is combined to protect the artisans of both sexes from\r\nthe perils that await them in other countries. Who has not heard of the\r\ntown of Lowell, where farmers' daughters go to earn their dowry, where\r\nthe labor of the factories brings no dissipation in its train, where the\r\nworkwomen read, write, teach Sunday-schools, where their morality\r\ndetracts nothing from their liberty and progress? When I have added\r\nthat the United States have not a single foundling asylum, it seems to\r\nme that I have indicated what we are to think at once of their good\r\nmorals and good sense.\r\n\r\nAnd let not the Americans he represented as a people at once honest and\r\nnarrow-minded. If they are still far from our level--and this must\r\nnecessarily be true, in an artistic and literary point of view--we are\r\nnot, however, at liberty to despise a country which counts such names as\r\nHawthorne, Longfellow, Emerson, Cooper, Poe, Washington Irving,\r\nChanning, Prescott, Motley, and Bancroft. Note that among these names,\r\nmen of imagination hold a prominent place, which proves, we may say in\r\npassing, that the country where we oftenest hear the exclamation, \"Of\r\nwhat use is it?\" agrees in finding poetry of some use. And I speak here\r\nneither of orators, like Mr. Seward or Mr. Douglas, nor of scholars,\r\nlike Lieutenant Maury, nor of those who, like Fulton or Morse, have\r\napplied science to art: judgment has been passed on all these points.\r\n\r\nBut the true superiority of Americans is in the universality of common\r\ninstruction. The Puritans, who came hither with their Bibles, were of\r\nnecessity zealous founders of schools; the Bible and the school go\r\ntogether. See, therefore, what the schools are in the United States! The\r\nState of Massachusetts alone, which does not number a million of souls,\r\ndevotes five millions yearly to its public instruction. If other States\r\nare far from equalling it in academies and higher institutions, all are\r\non a level with it as regards primary schools; a man or woman,\r\ntherefore, is rarely found outside the class of immigrants, who does not\r\npossess a solid knowledge of the elementary sciences, the extent of\r\nwhich would excite our surprise. By the side of the primary school, and\r\nto complete its instruction in the religious point of view, the\r\nAmericans have everywhere opened Sunday-schools, kept gratuitously by\r\nvolunteer teachers, among whom have figured many men of the highest\r\nstanding, several of whom have been Presidents of the Confederation.\r\nThese Sunday-schools, not less than twenty thousand in number, and\r\nsuperintended by one hundred and fifty thousand teachers, count more\r\nthan a million of pupils, of which ten thousand at least are adults.\r\nCalculate the power of such an instrument!\r\n\r\nPeople read enormously in America. There is a library in the meanest\r\ncabin of roughly-hewn logs, constructed by the pioneers of the West.\r\nThese poor log-houses almost always contain a Bible, often journals,\r\ninstructive books, sometimes even poetry. We in Europe, who fancy\r\nourselves fine amateurs of good verses, would scarcely imagine that\r\ncopies of Longfellow are scattered among American husbandmen. The\r\npolitical journals have many subscribers; those of the religious papers\r\nare no less numerous. I know of a monthly journal designed for children,\r\n(the _Child's Paper_,) of which three hundred thousand copies are\r\nprinted. This is the intellectual aliment of the country. In the towns,\r\nlectures are added to books, journals, and reviews: in all imaginable\r\nsubjects, this community, which the Government does not charge itself\r\nwith instructing, (at least, beyond the primary education,) educates and\r\ndevelops itself with indefatigable ardor. Ideas are agitated in the\r\nsmallest market-town; life is everywhere.\r\n\r\nAccustomed to act for themselves, knowing that they cannot count on the\r\nadministrative patronage of the State, the Americans excel in bringing\r\nindividual energies into action. There are few functionaries, few\r\nsoldiers, and few taxes among them. They know nothing, like us, of that\r\nmalady of public functions, the violence of which increases in\r\nproportion as we advance. They know nothing of those enormous imposts\r\nunder which Europe is bending by degrees--those taxes which almost\r\nsuppress property by overburdening its transmission; they have not come\r\nto the point of finding it very natural to devote one or two millions\r\nevery year to the expenses of the State, and no theory has been formed\r\nto prove to them that of all the expenses of the citizens, this is\r\napplied to the best purpose. They have not entered with the Old World\r\ninto that rivalry of armaments in which each nation, though it become\r\nexhausted in the effort, is bound to keep on a level with its neighbors,\r\nand in which no one will be stronger in the end when the whole world\r\nshall be subjugated. Their ten thousand regulars suffice, and they have\r\ntheir militia for extraordinary occasions. Lastly, their Federal debt is\r\ninsignificant; and, if the private debts of a few States reach a high\r\nfigure, they are nowhere of a nature to impose on the tax-payers a large\r\nsurplus of charges.\r\n\r\nAll of the great liberties exist in the United States: liberty of the\r\npress, liberty of speech, right of assemblage, right of association.\r\nExcept in the slave States, where the national institutions have been\r\nsubjected to deplorable mutilations in fact, every citizen can express\r\nhis opinion and maintain it openly, without meeting any other obstacle\r\nthan the contrary opinion, which is expressed with equal freedom.\r\n\r\nBut there is one ground above all where we should acknowledge the\r\nsuperiority of America: I mean, religious liberty. We are still in the\r\nbeginning of doubts upon the point as to where the interference of the\r\nState should cease; in what measure it should govern the belief of the\r\ncitizens, and its manifestation. These questions, alas, are still\r\npropounded among us. And there are countries at our doors, where men\r\nshudder at the mere idea that the law may some day cease to decide for\r\neach in what manner he is bound to worship God, that the courts may\r\ncease to punish those whose conscience turns aside from the path of the\r\nnation. Protestant Sweden but lately condemned dissenters to fine and\r\nimprisonment; Catholic Spain daily inflicts the severest penalties on\r\nthose who suffer themselves to profess or to propagate beliefs which are\r\nnot those of the country--those who sell the Scriptures, and those who\r\nread them.\r\n\r\nThe United States have not only proclaimed and loyally carried out the\r\nglorious principle of religious liberty, but have adopted as a corollary\r\nanother principle, much more contested among us, but which I believe\r\ndestined also to make the tout of the world: the principle of separation\r\nof Church and State. That believers should support their own worship,\r\nthat religious and political questions should never be blended, that the\r\ntwo provinces should remain distinct, is a simple idea which seems most\r\nstrange to us to-day. It will make its way like all other true ideas,\r\nwhich begin as paradoxes and end by becoming axioms. Meanwhile, the\r\nAmerican Confederation enjoys an advantage which more than one European\r\ngovernment, I suspect, would at some moments purchase at a high price:\r\nit has not to trouble itself about religious interests, either in its\r\naction without or its administration within. If there are conflicts\r\neverywhere in the spiritual order, it leaves them to struggle and become\r\nresolved in the spiritual order, without needing to trouble itself in\r\nthe matter. Hence arises for the State a freedom of bearing, a\r\nsimplicity of conduct, which we, who have to steer adroitly through so\r\nmany dangers, can hardly comprehend. The American government is sure of\r\nnever offending any church--it knows none; it does not interfere either\r\nto combat or to aid them; it has renounced, once for all, intervention,\r\nin the domain of conscience.\r\n\r\nThe result, doubtless, is, that this domain is not so well ordered as in\r\nEurope; the administrative ecclesiastical state has by no means\r\nsubmitted to such regulation. Is that to say that this inconvenience (if\r\nit be one) is not largely compensated for by its advantages? Is it\r\nnothing to suppress inheritance in religious matters, and to force each\r\nsoul to question itself as to what it believes? In the United States,\r\nadhesion to a church is an individual, spontaneous act, resulting from a\r\nvoluntary determination. This is so true that four-fifths of the\r\ninhabitants of the country do not bear, the title of church members.\r\nAlthough attending worship, although manifesting an interest and zeal in\r\nthe subject to which we are little accustomed, although assiduous\r\nchurch-goers, and liberal givers, they have not yet felt within\r\nthemselves a conviction strong and clear enough to make a public\r\nprofession of faith. Think what we may of such a system, we must avow,\r\nat least, that it implies a profound respect for sacred things; nothing\r\ncan less resemble that indolent and formal assent which we give, in\r\nconformity with custom, and without binding ourselves, in earnest, to\r\nthe religion that prevails among us.\r\n\r\nHence arises something valiant in American convictions. Hence arises\r\nalso, it may be said, that dispersion of sects, the picture of which is\r\nso often drawn for us. I am far from loving the spirit of sectarianism,\r\nand I am careful not to present the American churches as the beau ideal\r\nin religious matters. The sectarian spirit, the fundamental trait of\r\nwhich is to confound unity with uniformity, to transform divergencies\r\ninto separations, to refuse to admit into the bosom of the church the\r\nelement of diversity and of liberty; to exact the signing of a\r\ntheological formula, and the formal adhesion as a whole to a collection\r\nof dogmas and practices, without tolerating the slightest shade of\r\ndifference--the sectarian spirit, with its narrowness, with its\r\ntraditions of men, with its exaggeration of little things, with its\r\nseparate denominations, is certainly not worthy of admiration. I reject\r\nit in America as elsewhere, but I think it well to state that the\r\nreligious disruption produced by it has been much exaggerated. We must\r\ngreatly abbreviate the formidable list of churches furnished us by\r\ntravellers. Putting aside those which have no value, either as to\r\ninfluence or numbers, we reduce the numbers of denominations existing in\r\nthe United States, outside the Roman Catholic church, to five, (and\r\nthese are too many;) namely: Methodist, Baptist, Congregational,\r\nEpiscopal, and Presbyterian. The remainder is composed of small\r\neccentric congregations which spring up and die, and of which no one\r\ntakes heed, except a few tourists, who are always willing to note down\r\nextraordinary facts.\r\n\r\nWe will add that the sectarian spirit is now attacked in America, and\r\nthat the essential unity which binds the members of the five\r\ndenominations together, in spite of some external differences, is\r\nmanifesting itself forcibly. Not only does the evangelical alliance\r\nprove to the most sceptical that this unity is real, but a fact peculiar\r\nto the United States, the great awakening produced by the crisis of\r\n1857, has given evidence of the perfect harmony of convictions. In the\r\ninnumerable meetings caused to spring up by this awakening from one end\r\nof the country to the other, it has been impossible to distinguish\r\nBaptists, Presbyterians, or Congregationalists from each other. All have\r\nbeen there, and no one has betrayed by the least shade of dogmatism\r\nthose self-styled profound divisions about which so much noise is made.\r\nI invite those still in doubt to look at the manner in which public\r\nworship is established in the West: as soon as a few men have formed a\r\nsettlement, a missionary comes to visit them; no one inquires about his\r\ndenomination, for the Bible that he brings is the Bible of all, and the\r\nsalvation, through Christ, which he proclaims, is the faith of all. It\r\nsuffices, besides, to see this entire people, so restless, so laborious,\r\nleaving its business on Sunday to occupy itself with the thoughts of\r\nanother life; it suffices to observe the unanimous uprising of the\r\npublic conscience at the rumor of an attack directed against the Gospel,\r\nto perceive that unity subsists beneath lamentable divisions, and that\r\nindividual conviction creates the most active of all cohesive powers in\r\nthe heart of human communities; I know of no cement that equals it.\r\n\r\nIf individual convictions are a strong bond, they are also an\r\ninexhaustible source of life. It is easy to assure ourselves of this by\r\na brief survey of the proofs of Christian liberality which are displayed\r\nin the United States. Here, there is no legal charity, no aid to be\r\nexpected from the government, either for the support of churches, or for\r\nthat of the sick and poor; the _voluntary system_ must suffice for all.\r\nAnd, in fact, it does suffice for all.\r\n\r\nWhat is the first thing in question? To collect thirty million francs\r\nannually for the payment of the clergy. The thirty millions are\r\nfurnished: poor and rich, all give eagerly, and without compulsion. The\r\nnext thing in question is to provide for the construction of new\r\nchurches; now, it is necessary to finish not less than three of these\r\ndaily, for the clearing of the forests advances with rapid strides, and\r\na thousand churches, at least, are built every year. The majority of\r\nthese churches are doubtless composed of beams laid one upon another,\r\nthen painted white, or left of the natural color, and surmounted by a\r\nbell; they are simple and inexpensive, and, in the infant villages, the\r\nstreets of which are still blocked up by trees left standing, the place,\r\nserving at once for a church and a school, where the people gather round\r\nan itinerant preacher, is not decorated with much sumptuousness; yet\r\nthese new edifices demand annually from twelve to fifteen millions.\r\n\r\nNext come the religious societies. In the West, preachers are needed,\r\nhardy laborers, who live in privations, traversing vast solitudes on\r\nhorseback, and journeying continually, without repose, until their\r\nstrength is exhausted. Eight hundred missionaries or agents are required\r\nfor the American Board of Missions, for the Presbyterians, the Baptists,\r\nand all the other churches. Now, they cannot send them to the four\r\nquarters of the globe without providing for their wants. The Bible\r\nSociety, which prints three hundred thousand Bibles annually, the\r\nReligious Tract Society, which publishes every year five millions of\r\ntracts, and which, in New York alone, employs a thousand visitors or\r\ndistributors; the various works, in a word, expend from nine to ten\r\nmillion francs.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, is the budget of voluntary charity in the United States.[A]\r\nIt amounts to fifty or sixty million francs, without counting the very\r\nconsiderable donations destined to public instruction; without counting\r\n(and this is immense) the relief of the sick and the poor. You will\r\nscarcely find a village in the whole United States that has not its\r\nbenevolent society, and private benevolence, which is the best, also\r\ncarries on its work, independently of societies. I know of no country\r\nwhere acts of profuse liberality are more frequent; one man founds a\r\nhospital, another an observatory. Asylums are opened for all human\r\nunfortunates, for lunatics, the blind, the deaf, orphans, abandoned\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nWas I not right in saying that this is a great people? Whatever may be\r\nits vices, we are not at liberty to speak of it with disdain. If the\r\nAmericans know how to make a fortune, they know, also, how to make a\r\nnoble use of their fortune; accused with reason, as they are, of being\r\ntoo often preoccupied with questions of profit, we have seen them\r\nretrenching much of their luxury since the commercial crisis, yet\r\neconomizing very little in their charities. The budget of the churches\r\nand religious societies remained intact at the very time that\r\nembarrassment was everywhere prevailing. I cannot help believing that\r\nthere are peculiar blessings attached to so many voluntary sacrifices\r\nwhich carry back the mind to the early ages of Christianity. We may be\r\nsure that the religion that costs something, brings something also in\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: It seems that I have understated the truth; but I prefer to\r\ndo so; I wish, above all, to avoid exaggeration.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE CHURCHES AND SLAVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis leads me to examine a side of the American question upon which,\r\nattention is, naturally fixed at the present time; how is it that the\r\niniquities of slavery are maintained among this charitable and liberal\r\npeople? how is it that such iniquities have subsisted under the\r\ninfluence of so powerful a Christian sentiment? Can it be true that\r\nChristians have deserted the cause of justice? Has the Gospel had the\r\nplace which belongs to it, in the great struggle that is going on\r\nbetween the North and the South? yes; or no. This is perhaps the point\r\nof all others most important to clear up; first, because it is the one\r\non which the most errors have accumulated; next, because it is the one\r\nmost closely connected with the final solution; for this solution will\r\nnot be happy, if the Gospel has no hand in it.\r\n\r\nTo judge rightly, let us approach and endeavor to comprehend the true\r\nposition of those whose conduct we seek to appreciate. See the South,\r\nfor example, where the almost universal opinion is favorable to slavery,\r\nwhere governors write dithyrambics on its benefits, where many\r\nChristians have succeeded in discovering that it is sanctioned by the\r\nGospel, where men of sincerity are now placing their impious crusades in\r\nbehalf of its extension under the protection of God, where numerous\r\npreachers expound in their own way the celebrated text \"Cursed be\r\nCanaan!\" Do not these sentiments of the South, detestable as they are,\r\nfind, to a certain point, their explanation and excuse in the\r\ncircumstances in which the South is placed?\r\n\r\nThe power of surroundings is incalculable. If we ourselves, who condemn\r\nslavery, and are right in so doing, had been reared in Charleston; if we\r\nhad led a planter's life from our earliest infancy; if we had nourished\r\nour minds with their ideas; if we considered our monetary interests\r\nmenaced by Abolitionism; if the image of more fearful perils, of violent\r\ndestructions and massacres, appeared to haunt our thoughts; if the\r\npolitical antagonism between the North and the South came to add its\r\nvenom to the passions already excited within us, is it certain that we\r\nourselves should no be figuring at the present time among the\r\ndesperadoes who are firing upon the ships of the Union, and attempting\r\nthe foundation of a Southern Confederacy?\r\n\r\nIt is well to ask this of ourselves, in order to learn to respect, to\r\nlove, and consequently to aid those whose conduct we blame the most\r\nstrongly. For my part, whenever I am tempted to set myself up as a judge\r\nor an accuser of the South, I ask myself what I should do if I belonged\r\nto the South, and this brings me back to the true position. I remember,\r\ntoo, what I saw, with my own eyes, at the time when the discussion on\r\nslavery was carried on in France; the colonial passions, the blindest\r\nand most violent of all, broke out in Martinique and the isle of\r\nBourbon, as they had broken out before in Jamaica, where the circulars\r\nof Mr. Canning, the proposition, for example, to suppress the\r\nflagellation of women, had excited a veritable explosion. There were\r\nsome very honorable men among those who were indignant at this measure;\r\nand, among us, likewise, the planters who determined to combat all\r\nmodification of the negro system, were good men. Severity is almost\r\nalways a defect of memory; we blame others without pity, only when we\r\nbegin by forgetting our own history. We Frenchmen, who had so much\r\ndifficulty in emancipating our own slaves, and who would not, perhaps,\r\nhave succeeded in it, had it not been for the bold decision of M.\r\nSchoelcher; we, who have sought to take back, in part, through our\r\ncolonial regulations, the liberty accorded the blacks; we, who suffered\r\nrecruitals by purchase to be made on the African coast; who formerly\r\norganized the expedition charged with re-establishing slavery and the\r\nslave trade at St. Domingo; who suppressed the slave trade at the\r\nCongress of Vienna only in stipulating its continuance for some years;\r\nwho carried into our discussions on the right of search, a very meagre\r\ninterest for the victims of the slavers; we, whose consciences are\r\nburdened with these misdeeds, are bound to use indulgence towards the\r\nStates of the South.\r\n\r\nThis remark was necessary: it is from the South that the Biblical\r\ntheories in favor of slavery proceed; it is on account of the South that\r\nthese theories have been adopted by certain Christians of the North,\r\ndesirous, above every thing, of avoiding both the dismemberment of the\r\nUnited States, and that of the churches and religious societies. Take\r\naway the South, and no one in America, any more than in Europe, will\r\ndream of discovering in the Gospel the divine approbation of the\r\natrocities of slavery.\r\n\r\nI comprehend better than most, the sentiment of indignation that is\r\ncaused by these deplorable teachings, in which slavery is sometimes\r\nexcused, sometimes exalted; I comprehend, that, under the impulse of a\r\nsentiment so justifiable, one may be led on to anathematize preachers\r\nand churches in a mass, that he may even come to the point of\r\nrepresenting to himself the Christian faith as the true obstacle to the\r\nprogress of liberty. This is a great perversion of the truth, but we can\r\neasily understand how it has succeeded in gaining the assent of generous\r\nand sincere minds. I myself have read a sermon which was listened to\r\nwith sympathy in a certain Presbyterian church in New York, in which\r\nslavery, declares right until the return of Jesus Christ, ceases to be\r\nso, I know not why, during the millennium? I know the nature of that\r\ntheology, too truly styled _cottony_, which is displayed in the clerical\r\ncolumns of the _New York Observer_. Notwithstanding, I hasten to say\r\nthat these revolting excesses seldom appear except in seaports, and\r\nespecially in New York. The interests of this great city are bound up to\r\nsuch a degree with those of the cotton States, that, until very lately,\r\nNew York might have been considered as a prolongation of the South. We\r\nneed not be surprised, therefore, to find some congregations there which\r\nare ruled by the prejudices of the South. Besides, even in New York,\r\nother churches protest with holy zeal, and other journals, among which I\r\nwill cite the _Independent_, the organ of the Congregationalists, combat\r\nslavery unceasingly in the name of the Gospel.\r\n\r\nThen people persist in seeing only New York, in taking notice only of\r\nwhat passes in New York; but they forget that New York is ordinarily an\r\nexception in the North, as much by its commercial position as by its\r\nopinions and votes. Let us go ever so short a distance from the city\r\ninto the surrounding country, and we will encounter a different\r\nspirit--a spirit thoroughly impregnated with Christian faith, and little\r\ndisposed to covenant with slavery. There we begin to see that race of\r\nPuritan farmers, but lately represented by John Brown. Has not the\r\nattempt been made to transform him also into a free thinker, a\r\nphilosophic enemy of the Bible, and, from this very cause, an enemy to\r\nslavery? We need nothing more than his last letter to his wife, to show\r\nfrom what source he had drawn that courage, so misdirected but so\r\nindomitable, which he displayed at Harper's Ferry; the Christian, the\r\nBiblical and orthodox Christian, comes to explain the liberal and the\r\nhero.\r\n\r\nThat Christians in general condemned the enterprise of John Brown, while\r\nsympathizing with him, I hasten to acknowledge; and I am far from\r\nblaming them. That many have committed the real wrong of recoiling\r\nbefore the consequences of an open and decided conduct, I am forced to\r\nadmit. Yes, without even mentioning the South, where, as every one\r\nknows, the reign of terror prevails, there are numerous Protestant and\r\nCatholic churches in the remainder of the Confederation, which have\r\nrefused to declare themselves, as they should have done, in opposition\r\nto the crime of slavery. Let us not hasten, however, to cry out against\r\nfalsehood and hypocrisy; most honorable and sincere men have believed\r\nthat they would do more harm than good by bringing on a rupture with the\r\nSouth. Let us not forget that political rupture is complicated here with\r\nreligious rupture. Now, all the churches extend over both North and\r\nSouth; all the charitable societies number committees and subscribers in\r\nboth North and South. The point in question then, (let us weigh the\r\nimmensity of the sacrifice,) the point in question is to rend in twain\r\nall the churches, to break in pieces all the societies, to expose to\r\nperilous risks all the great works that do honor to the United States.\r\n\r\nDoubtless, to have gone their way, to have done their duty, and not to\r\nhave troubled themselves about the consequences, was the great rule of\r\naction. I grant it; yet, notwithstanding, I refuse to stigmatize, as\r\nmany have done, those men who have committed the fault of hesitating; I\r\nfeel that to rank them among the champions of slavery is to pervert\r\nfacts, and to fall into a blamable exaggeration. Again, to-day, after\r\nthe election of Mr. Lincoln, cannot citizens be cited in the North who\r\nare devoted to the cause of the negroes, but who refuse to participate\r\nin abolitionist demonstrations, because they fear (and the sentiments\r\ndoes them honor) to encourage the impending insurrections?\r\n\r\nThis said, I wish to prove by some too well-known facts, what has been\r\nthis forbearance, or even this pretended hesitation of orthodox\r\nChristianity. On regarding the churches, I see two, and the most\r\nconsiderable, which have openly declared themselves: the\r\nCongregationalists and the Methodists. About six months since, the\r\nGeneral Conference of Methodists resolutely plunged into the current\r\nwithout suffering itself to be trammelled by the protests which came to\r\nit from the South. I read in a report presented to one of the great\r\ndivisions of this church: \"We believe that to sell or to hold in bondage\r\nhuman beings under the name of chattels, is in contradiction to the\r\ndivine laws and to humanity; and that it conflicts with the golden rule\r\nand with the rule of our discipline.\" Last year, a numerous assemblage\r\nof delegates of the Congregational churches adopted the following\r\nresolution: \"Slaveholding is immoral, and slaveholders should not be\r\nadmitted as members of Christian churches. We ought to protest against\r\nit without ceasing, in the name of the Gospel, until it shall have\r\nentirely disappeared.\" And this resolution has not remained a dead\r\nletter: a Congregational church of Ohio has expelled from its bosom one\r\nof its deacons, who had contributed in the capacity of magistrate to the\r\nextradition of a fugitive slave.\r\n\r\nOther churches, without taking so decided a position, have at least\r\nmanifested by their internal convulsions the profound interest excited\r\namong them by the question of slavery. In this manner a secession has\r\njust rent the Presbyterian church in twain, because the declared\r\nadversaries of slavery were unwilling to remain responsible for a\r\nforbearance which appeared to them criminal. These things are signs of\r\nlife, and these signs are beginning to show themselves even in the midst\r\nof ecclesiastical bodies which have acted, until now, in the most\r\nunchristian manner. A warm discussion has been thus called forth, and\r\nthis signifies a great deal, among the members of the Episcopal church\r\nin New York. The majority stifled the debate; will it be able to do this\r\nalways?\r\n\r\nIf from the churches we proceed to the religious societies, we find the\r\nsame symptoms among them; here, they declare themselves openly against\r\nslavery, in spite of the menaces of the South; there, they succeed in\r\nstaving off the question, yet at the price of excited debates, which\r\ncontinually spring up again, of a great scandal, and of protests which\r\nare heard by Christians through the whole world. The course of conduct\r\nadopted by the great American Board of Missions is the more significant,\r\ninasmuch as its committee is composed of members belonging to various\r\nevangelical denominations; it stands, therefore, as their permanent\r\nrepresentative, yet this has not prevented its adoption, after long\r\nhesitation, of resolutions indicating in what course it will henceforth\r\nproceed: it has broken off its relations with the missionaries employed\r\namong the Choctaws, for the sole reason that they obstinately refused\r\nopenly to attack Indian slavery, and the abominable practices which it\r\nengenders. The Society, which long, too long, contented itself with a\r\ntimid and inconsistent censure, has been obliged, therefore, to resort\r\nto more decisive measures.\r\n\r\nAnother great body, the Tract Society, unfortunately, has not followed\r\nthis example; the general assemblies held at New York, and ruled by the\r\nspirit of that city, have given a majority to the party opposed to the\r\ndiscussion of the subject; but, be it said to the honor of American\r\nChristians, the very large minority resisted to the end; the latter was\r\nsustained by outside opinion, and many friends of the Gospel joined with\r\nit in deploring the pusillanimity which yielded to the menaces of the\r\nSouth. A crisis thence arose, which has not yet reached its height, and\r\nthe first fruits of which have been the foundation of a rival society in\r\nBoston, to which adherents are gathering from all sides.\r\n\r\nThese are grave events, for they manifest the inmost revolutions of the\r\nhuman soul. Would you know what will take place in political societies?\r\nBegin by informing yourself about what is taking place in the\r\nconsciences of the public. Now it is evident that the public conscience\r\nis in motion in the United States. The vast obstacles by which this\r\nmovement was trammelled have been surmounted on every side. I wish no\r\nother proof of this than the deplorable fact of which I have just made\r\nmention: the conduct of the Tract Society, the internal crisis which it\r\nhas experienced, the reprobation which it encounters, in Europe as in\r\nAmerica. Are not these palpable proofs of the too little known truth\r\nthat the great moral force which is struggling with American slavery is\r\nthe Gospel?\r\n\r\nAnd how could it be otherwise? If we had not positive facts before our\r\neyes, if we did not know that one entire sect of Christians, the\r\nQuakers, have devoted themselves, body and goods, to the service of poor\r\nfugitive slaves, if we did not recognize the deep Puritan imprint in the\r\nmovement which has colonized Kansas, and in that which has borne Mr.\r\nLincoln to the presidency, should we not be forced to ask ourselves\r\nwhether it is possible that the Gospel remains a stranger to a struggle\r\nundertaken for liberty? There exist, thank God, between liberty and the\r\nGospel, close, eternal, and indestructible relations. I know of one\r\nspecies of freedom which contains the germ of all the rest--freedom of\r\nsoul; now what was it, if not the Gospel, that introduced this freedom\r\ninto the world? Remember ancient Paganism: neither liberty of\r\nconscience, nor liberty of individuals, nor liberty of families--such\r\nwas its definition. The State laid its hand upon all the inmost part of\r\nexistence, the creeds of the fathers, and the education of the children;\r\nmoral slavery also existed everywhere, and if slavery, properly called,\r\nhad been anywhere wanting, it would have given cause for astonishment.\r\nThe Gospel came, and with it these new phenomena: individual belief,\r\ntrue independence makes its advent here on earth, a liberty worthy of\r\nthe name appears finally among men. From this time we see men lifting up\r\ntheir heads, despotism finding its limits, the humblest, the weakest\r\nopposing to it insurmountable barriers.\r\n\r\nThey act without reflection, who attempt to place in opposition these\r\ntwo things: the Gospel and liberty. And remark that in the United\r\nStates, in particular, the Gospel and liberty are accustomed to go\r\ntogether; they first landed together at New Plymouth with the passengers\r\nof the Mayflower. Why had these poor pilgrims torn themselves from all\r\nthe habits of home and country, to seek in the dead of winter an asylum\r\non an unknown soil? Because they loved the Gospel, and because they\r\ndesired liberty; the chief of liberties--that of the conscience. From\r\nthe 21st of December, 1620, there existed on the shores of the New World\r\nthe beginning of a free people--free through the powerful influence of\r\nthe Gospel. All who have studied the United States with sincerity, will\r\nratify the opinion of M. de Tocqueville: \"America is the place, of all\r\nothers, where the Christian religion has preserved the most power over\r\nsouls.\" This power is such, that we find it at the base of all lasting\r\nreforms. In this country, in which the idea of authority has little\r\nforce, there is one authority, that of the Bible, before which the\r\nmajority bow, and which is of the more importance inasmuch as it alone\r\ncommands respect and obedience.\r\n\r\nIf you doubt the decisive part which the Gospel fills in American\r\ndebates, look at the pains taken by parties to render public homage to\r\nit, the Democrats as the Republicans, Mr. Buchanan as Mr. Lincoln. Then\r\nlook more closely at the Republican party, do you not find in it again\r\nthe visible traces of Puritanism? It is the ancient States, it is old\r\nAmerica, it is also the Young America of the farmers, of the pioneers of\r\nthe Western solitudes, the America of the clearers of the forests, the\r\nAmerica of the Bible and the schools. This America long since abolished\r\nslavery, and prevented its introduction into the territories that\r\nacknowledged its influence. In the meanest of its cabins, you will find\r\nthe Scriptures, hymn books, reports of religious societies; in the\r\nmajority of its families, domestic worship is celebrated; in its\r\nprayer-meetings, it is not rare to see physicians, lawyers, magistrates,\r\nmarine officers, taking part publicly; its statesmen do not think\r\nthemselves dishonored by keeping a Sunday-school; the Gospel, in a word,\r\nis a power to which no other can compare, and outside of which it would\r\nbe puerile to expect to succeed in accomplishing any thing of\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nHere the action of the Gospel can be plainly detected; an important\r\nreligious event preceded and paved the way for the political event which\r\nwe have witnessed: before the election of Mr. Lincoln, an awakening took\r\nplace. The American awakening, which must not be confounded with those\r\n_revivals_, the description and sometimes the caricature of which have\r\nbeen transmitted us by travellers, the awakening, which had neither\r\necstasies nor convulsive sobs, and the distinctive feature of which was\r\na tone of simplicity and conviction, produced one of those profound\r\nagitations of the conscience, which give rise to generous resolutions.\r\nThe financial crisis had just overthrown the fortunes of the people;\r\nthey turned towards God and began to pray. On a route of three thousand\r\nmiles, wherever one might stop, he found a meeting, a simple,\r\nspontaneous meeting, at which the pastors did not take the initiative,\r\nwhere they were present instead of presiding. Ere long, public attention\r\nbecame fixed on this movement, the greatness of which could not be\r\ncontested; the most hostile journals ended by rendering it homage. And\r\nit lasted, it still subsists, it has produced something else than\r\nmeetings and prayers, it has induced extensive moral reforms, it has\r\nclosed places of debauchery and taverns by hundreds. The military and\r\ncommercial marine of the United States has been especially subjected to\r\nits influence; captains, officers, and sailors in great numbers, have\r\nshown by their lives that their habits of piety are more than a vain\r\nform; American vessels are perhaps the only ones at the present day in\r\nwhich groups of sailors assemble to converse on the interests of their\r\nsoul, and to make the praises of God resound over the ocean.\r\n\r\nIn strengthening the religious element, in exciting the Puritan fibre of\r\nAmerica, the awakening certainly contributed a great share to the\r\nsuccess of the party opposed to slavery. South Carolina acknowledged\r\nthis herself lately, when she inserted the following phrase in her\r\ndeclaration of independence: \"The public opinion of the North has given\r\nto a great political error the sanction of a still more erroneous\r\nreligious sentiment.\" Is this religious sentiment, assailed by the\r\nslaveholders, that of free thinkers, or of Christians? The South is not\r\nmistaken; it knows that the truly difficult acts of emancipation are\r\naccomplished on earth only by the power of the Gospel; it saw the great\r\nabolition impulse rise in England, and spread over the United States;\r\njournals, committees, correspondence, all indicated that the English had\r\nbecome the American movement, and was continued under the same banner.\r\nUnder this banner, and this alone, it has conquered. A colossal work in\r\nfact is here in question, before which all purely human forces fall to\r\nthe ground. If such prodigious Christian efforts were needed to give the\r\nvictory to Wilberforce, what will be required in the heart of a country\r\nwhere slavery is not exiled to distant colonies, and where it has\r\nacquired formidable proportions with years. There are easy abolitions,\r\nwhich are wrought in some sort of themselves, and which seem the natural\r\ncorollary of a political revolution; as, for instance, that which\r\noccurred forty years ago in the Spanish republics. Bolivar, Quiroga, and\r\nthe other leaders, needed the support of all classes of the population\r\nin their struggle against Spain; they adopted the expedient of\r\nsuppressing slavery. In taking this resolution, they accomplished a\r\nmost honorable deed, but they made little change in the condition of the\r\ncountry, for large planting was rare, and both the blacks and the whites\r\nwere few in numbers, less numerous, indeed, than the Indians and the\r\nhalf breeds.\r\n\r\nIf political reasons then sufficed, it is evident that they are far from\r\nsufficing to-day: we must seek elsewhere for the explanation of the\r\nmovement which, a long time wavering and suppressed, has just manifested\r\nits irresistible power in the United States. We have recognized in it\r\nthe hand of the Gospel; and this is no indifferent matter, for if the\r\nGospel had no part in it, such a movement would end in destruction.\r\n\r\nThe responsibility of Christians will be great in America; they can do\r\nmuch for the favorable solution of a problem which menaces the future of\r\ntheir country, and overshadows that of humanity. The mode of\r\npacification here is, to declare themselves; the pretensions of the\r\nSouth, its fatal progress, the extreme peril to which but lately it\r\nexposed the Confederation, are due much more than is imagined to the\r\ndeplorable hesitation of the religious societies and the churches. If it\r\nhad long since been brought face to face with a determined evangelical\r\ndoctrine, the South, which knows also, though in a less degree, the\r\ninfluence of the Gospel, would have avoided falling into the excesses to\r\nwhich it is now abandoned. The faults of the past are irreparable, but\r\nit is possible to ward off their return. Let all Northern churches, let\r\nall societies, let all eminent Christians take henceforth with firmness\r\nthe position which they ought to have taken from the first; let them\r\npresent to their Southern brethren a solid rallying point, and the\r\neffects of this faithful conduct will not be slow in making themselves\r\nfelt. There is, in the slave States, especially in those occupying an\r\nintermediate position, more disturbance of thought, and more conflicts\r\nof feeling, than we generally suppose. Let the banner of the Christian\r\nfaith be openly displayed, and many good men will rally round it: this\r\nis certain.\r\n\r\nAnd let no one put forward the shameful pretext: there are sceptics,\r\nrationalists, free thinkers in the ranks of Abolitionism! Why not?\r\nQuestions of this sort, thanks to the Gospel, have entered in the domain\r\nof common morality; shall I desert these questions in order to avoid\r\ncontact with men who reject the essential doctrines of Christianity? I\r\nconfess that the orthodoxy which should draw such conclusions would\r\nappear suspicious to me. Voltaire pleading for the Calas will not make\r\nme turn my back on religious liberty; Channing writing pages against\r\nslavery, revealing a heart more Christian than his doctrine; Parker,\r\nblending his noble efforts in favor of the negroes with his assaults\r\nagainst the Bible, will not alienate me from a cause which was mine\r\nbefore it was theirs.\r\n\r\nI say, besides, that the objections of these men against Christianity\r\nforce me to ask whether our conduct as Christians be not one of the\r\nprincipal causes of their scepticism. Is it quite certain that Voltaire\r\nhimself would have been the adversary that we know him, if he had not\r\nseen that thought was stifled, that liberty was crushed, that conscience\r\nwas violated in the name of the Gospel? Would not this same Gospel have\r\npresented itself under a different aspect to Parker, Channing, and the\r\nother Unitarians of Boston, if they had seen it at its post, the post of\r\nhonor, at the head of all generous ideas and true liberties? Yes; there\r\nare Abolitionists who reject the Bible because they have heard certain\r\northodox Christians maintain that the Bible is in favor of slavery.\r\nWhoever preaches this, is of a school of impiety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE GOSPEL AND SLAVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow did they set to work to preach this? I will answer this question by\r\ntwo others: How did Bossuet set to work to write his _Politique tirée de\r\nl'Ecriture,_ to proclaim in the name of the Bible obligatory monarchy,\r\ndivine right, the absolute authority of kings, the duty of destroying\r\nfalse religion by force, the duty of officially sustaining the truth,\r\nthe duty of having a budget of modes of worship, the duty of uniting\r\nChurch and State, without speaking of his Biblical apology for war, for\r\nthe use of Louis XIV.? How did certain doctors among the Roundheads, in\r\ntheir turn, set to work to proclaim the divine right of republics, and\r\nto ordain the massacre of the new Amalekites? The method is very simple:\r\nit consists only in confounding the law with the Gospel. This confusion\r\nonce wrought, the political and civil institutions of the Old Testament\r\nlose their temporary and local character, and we go to the New\r\nTestament in search of what is not there: namely, political and civil\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nThough the Gospel is not the law, it is a truth which has been making\r\nits way since the seventeenth century, and which seems to be no longer\r\ncontested to-day, except in the camp of the champions of slavery. The\r\nGospel, which addresses itself to all nations and all ages, does not\r\npretend to force them into the strait vestments of the ancient Jewish\r\nnation; no more does it pretend to \"sew a piece of new cloth on an old\r\ngarment, else the new cloth taketh away from the old, and the rent is\r\nmade worse.\" I speak here with a view to those who, in the law as in the\r\nGospel, in the New Testament as in the Old, venerate the infallible word\r\nof God. A revelation, to be divine, does not cease to be progressive,\r\nand nothing exacts that all truths should be promulgated in a single\r\nday. If God deemed proper to give to his people, so long as they needed\r\nit, a legislation adapted to their social condition, this legislation,\r\ndivinely given at that time, may be also divinely abrogated afterward.\r\nAnd this is what has taken place. Those who quote to us texts from the\r\nOld Testament concerning slavery, appear to have forgotten the saying of\r\nJesus Christ in reference to another institution, divorce: \"It was on\r\naccount of the hardness of your hearts.\" Yes, on account of the hardness\r\nof their hearts, God established among the Israelites, incapable, at\r\nthat time, of rising higher, provisory regulations,[B] perfect as\r\nregards his condescension, but most imperfect, as he declares himself,\r\nas regards the absolute truth. He who makes no account of this great\r\nfact will find in the books of Moses, and in the Prophets, pretexts\r\neither for practising to-day what was tolerated only for a time, or for\r\nattacking the Scriptures, indignant at what they contain.\r\n\r\nIt was Jesus Christ himself, therefore, who drew the line of demarcation\r\nbetween the law and the Gospel--who announced the end of local and\r\ntemporary institutions. Has he revealed other institutions, this time\r\ndefinitive? To form such an idea of the Gospel, we must never have\r\nopened it. The Gospel is not a Koran. In the Koran, we doubtless find\r\nboth civil and criminal laws, and the principles of government; the\r\nApostles did not once tread on this ground. Fancy what their work would\r\nhave been, had they substituted a social for a spiritual revolution--had\r\nthey touched, above all, the question of slavery, which formed part of\r\nthe fundamental law of the ancient world. And here I wish my thought to\r\nbe clearly comprehended: I do not pretend that the Apostles were\r\nconscious of the unlawfulness of slavery, and that they avoided pointing\r\nit out through policy, for fear of compromising their work. No, indeed,\r\nthis happened unconsciously. According to all appearances, they held the\r\nopinions of their times, and God revealed nothing to them on the\r\nsubject, wishing that the abolition of slavery, like all the social\r\nresults of the Gospel, should be produced by moral agency, which works\r\nfrom within outward, which changes the heart before changing the\r\nactions.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Apostles, there were many other abuses than slavery;\r\nthey never wrote a word in their condemnation. They make allusions to\r\nwar, yet say nothing of the nameless horrors which then attended it;\r\nthey speak of the sword placed in the king's hands to punish crime, yet\r\nsay nothing of those atrocious tortures, in the first rank of which must\r\nbe cited crucifixion; they make use of figures borrowed from the public\r\ngames, yet say nothing either of the combats of the gladiators, or of\r\nthe abominations which sullied other spectacles; they unceasingly call\r\nto mind the reciprocal relations of husbands and wives, of parents and\r\nchildren, yet say nothing of the despotic authority which the Roman law\r\nconferred upon the father, or of the debasement to which it condemned\r\nthe wife. The evangelical method is this: it has not occupied itself\r\nwith communities, yet has wrought the profoundest of the social\r\nrevolutions; it has not demanded any reform, yet has accomplished all of\r\nthem; the atrocities of war and of torture, the gladiatorial combats and\r\nimmodest spectacles, the despotism of fathers and the debasement of\r\nwomen, all have disappeared before a profound, internal action, which\r\nattacks the very roots of the evil.\r\n\r\nNot only does the Gospel forbear to touch on social and religious\r\nproblems, but, even on questions of morals, it refuses to furnish\r\ndetailed solutions. Its system of morality is very short; and in this\r\nlies its greatness, through this it becomes morality instead of\r\ncasuistry. Cases of conscience, special directions, a moral code,\r\npromulgated article by article--you will find in it nothing of this\r\nsort. What you will find there, and there alone, is a growing morality,\r\nwhich passes my expression. Two or three sayings were written eighteen\r\ncenturies ago, and these sayings contain in the germ a series of\r\ncommandments, of transformation, of progression, which we have not\r\nnearly exhausted. I spoke a moment since of the progress of revelations;\r\nI must speak now of the progress which is being wrought in virtue of a\r\nrevelation constantly the same, but constantly becoming better\r\nunderstood, which multiplies our duties in proportion as it enlightens\r\nour conscience. With the one saying: \"What ye would that men should do\r\nunto you, do ye also to them,\" the Gospel has opened before us infinite\r\nvistas of moral development.\r\n\r\nBefore this one saying, the cruelties and infamous customs of ancient\r\nsociety, not mentioned by the Apostles, have successively succumbed;\r\nbefore this one saying, the modern family has been formed; before this\r\none saying, American slavery will disappear as European slavery has\r\ndisappeared already. With this saying, we are all advancing, we are\r\nlearning, and we shall continue to learn. Yes, the time will come, I am\r\nconvinced, when we shall see new duties rise up before us, when we\r\ncannot with a clear conscience maintain customs, what, I know not, which\r\nwe maintain conscientiously to-day.\r\n\r\nThis carries us somewhat further, it must be granted, than a list of\r\nfixed duties _ne varietur_; it opposes slavery in a different manner\r\nthan a sentence pronounced once for all. The Gospel took the surest\r\nmeans of overthrowing it when, letting alone the reform of institutions,\r\nit contented itself with pursuing that of sentiments; when it thus\r\nprepared the time when the slaveholder himself would be forced to ask\r\nwhat is contained in the inexhaustible saying: \"What ye would that men\r\nshould do unto you, do ye also unto them.\" Even in the heart of the\r\nSouthern States, despite the triple covering of habits, prejudices, and\r\ninterests, this saying is making its way, and is disturbing the\r\nconsciences of the people much more than is generally believed. And the\r\nwork that it has begun it will finish; it will force the planters to\r\n_translate_ the word SLAVERY, to consider one by one the abominable\r\npractices which constitute it. Is it to do to others as we would that\r\nthey should do to us, to sell a family at retail? To maintain laws which\r\ngive over every slave, whether wife or maiden, to her owner, whatever he\r\nmay be, and which take away from this maiden, from this wife, the\r\n_right_ of remembering her modesty and her duties--what do Christians\r\ncall this? To produce marketable negroes, to dissolve marriages, to\r\nordain adulteries, to inflict ignoble punishment, to interdict\r\ninstruction--is this doing to others what we would that they should do\r\nto us?\r\n\r\nThe Christian sense of right is relentless, thank God; it does not\r\nsuffer itself to be deceived by appearances; where we dispute about\r\nwords, it forces us to go to facts. Now, look at the facts which are\r\nreally in question in America, when the great subject of slavery is\r\ndiscussed there theoretically. Against the great evangelical system of\r\nmorality, the Judaical interpretations of such or such a text have\r\nlittle chance. The epistle of Paul, sending back to Philemon his\r\nfugitive slave Onesimus, is quoted to us. Assuredly, the Apostle\r\npronounces in it no anathema against slavery, nor does he exact\r\nenfranchisement; these ideas were unknown to him; but he says: \"I\r\nbeseech thee for my son whom I have begotten in my bonds, whom I have\r\nsent again: thou therefore receive him, that is my own bowels. Without\r\nthy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were\r\nof necessity, but willingly. For perhaps he therefore departed for a\r\nseason, that thou shouldest receive him forever; not now as a servant,\r\nbut above a servant, a brother beloved. Having confidence in thy\r\nobedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt do also more than I\r\nsay.\"\r\n\r\nDoes any one fancy Philemon treating Onesimus, after this epistle, as\r\nfugitive slaves are treated in America, putting up his wife and children\r\ndirectly after for sale, or delivering him, over to the first slave\r\nmerchant that was willing to take charge of him, and carry him a hundred\r\nleagues away? It is so certain that Philemon did more than had been told\r\nhim, that the Epistle to the Colossians shows us the \"faithful and\r\nwell-beloved brother Onesimus\" honorably mentioned among those concerned\r\nabout the spiritual interests of the church.\r\n\r\nDo what one will, there is an implied abolition of slavery (implied but\r\npositive) at the bottom of that close fraternity created by the faith in\r\nthe Saviour. Between _brethren_, the relation of master and slave, of\r\nmerchant and merchandise, cannot long subsist. To sell on an\r\nauction-block or deliver over to a slave-driver an immortal soul, for\r\nwhich Christ has died, is an enormity before which the Christian sense\r\nof right will always recoil in the end. \"In this,\" it is written, \"there\r\nis neither Greek nor Jew, nor circumcision nor uncircumcision, nor\r\nbarbarian nor Seythian, nor bond nor free, but Christ is all and in\r\nall.\" Let slaveholders put to themselves the question what they would\r\nsay to-day if the epistle to Philemon were addressed to them; and it is\r\naddressed to them; the Onesimuses of the South--and such there are--are\r\nthus thrown upon the conscience of their masters, their brothers.\r\n\r\nI have said enough on the subject to dispense with examining very\r\nnumerous passages in which slavery is _supposed_ by the writers of the\r\nNew Testament. The duties of masters and of slaves are laid down by them\r\nwithout doubt, and the existence of the institution is not contested for\r\na moment; only, it is brought face to face with that which will slay it:\r\nthe doctrine of salvation through Christ, of pardon, of humility, of\r\nlove, is, in itself, and without the necessity of expressing it, the\r\nabsolute negation of slavery.\r\n\r\nIt has fully proved so, and the early ages of Christianity leave no\r\ndoubt as to the interpretation given by Christians to the teachings of\r\nthe Apostles. Despite the rapid corruptions introduced into the\r\nchurches, we see one brilliant fact shining forth in them: emancipations\r\nbecoming more frequent, slaves, as well as free men, succeeding to\r\necclesiastical offices, spiritual equality producing the fruit which it\r\ncannot help producing, namely, legal equality. Observe, too, how the\r\nedicts of the emperors multiplied as soon as the influence of\r\nChristianity was exerted in the Roman world. And all these edicts had\r\nbut one aim: to sweeten servitude, to increase affranchisement by law,\r\nto facilitate voluntary emancipation.\r\n\r\nWhat the Gospel did then against European slavery, it is doing now\r\nagainst American slavery. Its end is the same; its weapons are the same;\r\nthey have not rusted during eighteen centuries. Those planters of the\r\nEnglish islands were not mistaken, who, instinctively divining where lay\r\ntheir great enemy, had recourse to every measure to expel missionaries\r\nfrom among them. Neither were those Texan executioners mistaken, who\r\nlately put to death the missionary Bewley, a touching martyr to the\r\ncause of the slaves. I ask, in the face of the gallows of Bewley, what\r\nwe are to think of that prodigious paradox according to which the Gospel\r\nis the patron of slavery. To those who mistake its meaning on this\r\npoint, the Gospel replies by its acts; it replies also by the unanimous\r\ntestimony of its servants. What is more striking, in fact, than to see\r\nthat, apart from the country in which the action of interests and habits\r\ndisturbs the judgment of Christians, there is but one way of\r\ncomprehending and interpreting the Scripture on this point? Consult\r\nEngland, France, Germany; Christians everywhere will tell you that the\r\nGospel abolished slavery, although it does not say a single word which\r\nwould proclaim this abolition. Why, if the doubt were possible, would\r\nnot diversity of opinions be also possible among disinterested judges?\r\nTo speak only of France, see the synods of our free churches, which\r\ncontinually stigmatize both Swedish intolerance and American slavery;\r\nsee an address signed three years ago by the pastors and the elders of\r\nfive hundred and seventy-one French churches, which has gone to carry to\r\nthe United States the undoubted testimony of a conviction which in truth\r\nis that of all.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that our demonstration is complete. What would it be if I\r\nshould add that American slavery, which its friends so strangely claim\r\nto place under the protection of the Apostles, has nothing in common\r\nwith that of which the Apostles had cognizance. The thing, however, is\r\ncertain. Slavery, in the United States, is founded on color, it is\r\n_negro_ slavery. Now, this is a fact wholly new in the history of\r\nmankind, a monstrous fact, which profoundly modifies the nature of\r\nslavery. Before Las Casas, that virtuous creator of the slave trade, the\r\nname of which comprises to him alone a whole commentary on the maxim \"Do\r\nevil that good may come,\" before Las Casas, no one had thought of\r\nconnecting slavery with race. Now, the slavery connected with race is\r\nthat of all others most difficult to uproot, for it bears an indelible\r\nsign of inequality, a sign which the law did not create, and which it\r\ncannot destroy.\r\n\r\nSuch was not the slavery that offered itself to the eyes of the Prophets\r\nand Apostles; a normal servitude, of right, based upon a native and\r\nindestructible inferiority was not then in question, but an accidental\r\nservitude among equals, to which the chances of war had given birth, and\r\nwhich emancipation suppressed entire. Quite different is the slavery\r\nwhich depends on race, and which, it may be said, supposes a\r\nmalediction; do what one will, this latter will subsist, it will, in a\r\nmanner, survive itself; it will find, besides, in the idea of a\r\nprovidential dispensation, the natural excuse for its excesses. This\r\nslavery the Bible condemns in the most explicit manner. If its champions\r\ndare suppose two species, the book of Genesis shows them all mankind\r\nspringing from one man, and the Gospel recounts to them the redemption\r\nwrought in behalf of all the descendants of Adam; if they argue from the\r\ncurse pronounced against Canaan, the Old Testament presents to them the\r\ndetailed enumeration of the Canaanites, a vast family, in which the\r\nwhites figure as well as the blacks.\r\n\r\nIn short, there is a deadly struggle between the Gospel and slavery\r\nunder all its forms, and particularly under the odious form which the\r\nAfrican slave trade has given it in modern times. The Gospel has been,\r\nis, and will be, at the head of every earnest movement directed against\r\nslavery. It is important that it should be so; it is the only means of\r\navoiding the acts of violence, the revolts, the extreme calamities from\r\nwhich the whites and the blacks would equally suffer. The Gospel is\r\nadmirable, inasmuch as by the side of the duties of masters, it\r\nproclaims those of slaves; as in the time of the Apostles, it does not\r\nhesitate to recommend to them gentleness, submission, scrupulous\r\nfidelity, love for those who maltreat them, the practice of difficult\r\nvirtues; it makes them free within, in order to render them capable of\r\nbecoming free without.\r\n\r\nTo judge of this method, we have only to compare the miserable\r\npopulation of St. Domingo with the beautiful free villages which cover\r\nthe English islands. How true the saying: \"The wrath of man never\r\naccomplishes the justice of God.\" Wherever the wrath of man has had full\r\nsway, even to chastise abominable abuses, it has remained a curse. I\r\ntremble when I think of the revolts which may break out at any moment in\r\nthe Southern States. Bloodshed, let us not forget, would sully our\r\nbanner; to the right of the slaves, such a crisis would be forever\r\nopposed, and who knows whether a terrible return might not burst upon\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nThe mind becomes troubled at the mere image of the horrors that would\r\nensue from civil war. May the Christians of America comprehend, at\r\nlength, in a more perfect manner, the greatness of the part that God\r\nreserves for them, and the extent of the responsibilities that are\r\nweighing upon them. To take a stand frankly against slavery; to remove\r\ntheir last pretexts from sincere men who seek to reconcile it with the\r\nGospel; to organize in the North the action of a vast moral power; to\r\naddress to the South words breathing forth truth and charity; to appeal\r\nwithout wearying to the hearts of masters and slaves; to prepare for\r\ntrying moments that guarantee which nothing can replace, the common\r\nfaith of the blacks and the whites; to keep courage even when all seems\r\nlost; to practise the Christian vocation, which consists in pursuing and\r\nrealizing the impossible; to show once more to the world the power that\r\nresides in justice--this is to accomplish a noble task.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: These provisory and imperfect regulations appear none the\r\nless admirable when compared, not only with the systems of legislation\r\nof other nations of antiquity, but with those which prevail to-day even\r\nin the Southern States. According to the law of Moses, the Jewish slave\r\nalways becomes free in seven years; the foreign slave also becomes free\r\nwhen his master wounds him in chastising him; he has the right to\r\ntestify in law; he has the right to acquire and to possess.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESENT CRISIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now possess the principal elements of our solution; we can approach\r\nthe problem just propounded by the present crisis, and, confining\r\nourselves no longer to the appreciation of the past, can glance at the\r\nfuture. Not, indeed, that I make any pretensions to prophecy; political\r\npredictions, suspected with reason in all times, should be still more so\r\nat our epoch, which is that of the unforeseen. But I have a right to\r\nprove that the work which is being pursued in America is, as I have\r\naffirmed, a work of elevation, not of destruction. The dangers which the\r\nnation is advancing to meet are nothing, compared with those towards\r\nwhich it was lately progressing; the election of Mr. Lincoln, and the\r\nsecession of the cotton States have introduced a new position which at\r\nlast affords a glimpse of real chances of salvation.\r\n\r\nI have named secession: what are we to think of the principle on which\r\nit rests? For this question another may be substituted: what is a\r\nConfederation? If we reduce it, which is inadmissible, to a simple\r\nleague of States, it still remains none the less binding on each of\r\nthem, so long as the end of the league remains intact. Never yet existed\r\non earth, a federal compact conceived in this wise: \"The States which\r\nform a part of this league will remain in it only till it pleases them\r\nto leave it.\" Such, notwithstanding, is the formula on which the\r\nSouthern theorists make a stand. Among the anarchical doctrines that our\r\nage has seen hatched, (and they are numerous,) this seems to me worthy\r\nof occupying the place of honor. This right of separation is simply the\r\n_liberum veto_ resuscitated for the benefit of federal institutions. As\r\nin the horseback diets of Poland, a single opposing vote could put a\r\nstop to every thing, so that it only remained to vote by sabre-strokes,\r\nso Confederations, recognizing the right of separation, would have no\r\nother resort than brute force, for no great nation can allow itself to\r\nbe killed without defending itself.\r\n\r\nPicture to yourselves, I intreat you, the progress that political\r\ndemoralization would make under such a system. As there is never a law\r\nor a measure that is not displeasing to some one, it would be necessary\r\nto live in the presence of the continually repeated threat: \"If the law\r\npasses, if the measure is adopted, if the election takes place, if you\r\ndo not do all I want, if you do not yield to all my caprices, I leave\r\nyou, I constitute myself an independent State, I provoke the formation\r\nof a rival Confederacy.\" The worst causes are the readiest to threaten\r\nin this style; having nothing reasonable to say in their own favor, they\r\nwillingly proceed to violence, and the saying of Themistocles would find\r\nhere a legitimate application: \"You are angry, therefore, you are\r\nwrong.\"\r\n\r\nWhat the result of this would be, we can imagine. No question would be\r\nlonger judged by its own merits; the despotism of bad men would be\r\nestablished; expedients would take the place of principles; fear would\r\nput justice to flight; national resolutions would be nothing more than\r\ncompromises and bargains. This, we must admit, is something like what\r\nhas been passing in the United States since the South proclaimed its\r\nultra policy, and placed its pretensions under the protection of its\r\nthreats. If they had once more bowed the head, all would have been lost;\r\nthe dignity, the mental liberty of America, would have suffered complete\r\nshipwreck; of all this noble system of government, there would have\r\nremained standing but a single maxim: Accord always and everywhere\r\nwhatever is necessary to prevent the separation of the South.\r\nUnconstitutional in all places, the theory of separation is doubly so in\r\nthe United States, where the federal system is more concentrated than\r\nelsewhere. It is without doubt a federal system; the separate States\r\npreserve the right in it of regulating their special legislation, of\r\ngoverning themselves as they choose, and even of holding and practising\r\nprinciples which are profoundly repugnant to other parts of the\r\nConfederation; the central power is, however, endowed with an extended\r\nsphere.\r\n\r\nIt has its taxes, its officers, its army, its courts; it possesses in\r\nthe Territory of the different States federal property depending upon it\r\nalone; in fine, its general government and general legislation apply to\r\nthe effective handling of all the essential interests of the nation. I\r\nam not surprised that the American Confederation is so strongly cemented\r\ntogether, excluding the pretended right of separation better than any\r\nother; the States that united towards the close of the last century were\r\nalready in the habit of acting in concert; they were of the same blood,\r\nand had lived under the same rule; their history, their interests,\r\ntheir customs, their tongue, their religion, all contributed to bind\r\nthem closely to each other.\r\n\r\nBesides, the question is unanimously resolved in the United States.\r\nApart from the _fire-eaters_, not a person is found who has the\r\nslightest doubt as to the impossibility of modifying, by the violent\r\ndecision of a few, the common Constitution which contains the\r\nenumeration of the States, and which can only be amended by a solemn\r\nact, voted in the special form prescribed by the compact. Mr. Lincoln\r\nmerely expressed the general opinion when he said the other day: \"The\r\nUnion is a regular marriage, not a sort of free relation which can be\r\nmaintained only by passion.\" _Secession is Revolution_ is a political\r\naxiom which has been current at all times in the United States. It is\r\nbecause they are something else than a juxtaposition of States, that\r\nthey comprise, by the side of a Senate in which all the States are\r\nequal, a House of Representatives, in which the number of deputies is in\r\nproportion to the population. \"Our Constitution,\" wrote Madison, \"is\r\nneither a centralized State nor a Federal Government, but a blending of\r\nthe two.\" The experience which they had had from 1776 to 1789 had taught\r\nthe different States the necessity of giving a more concentrated\r\ncharacter to their federation. Let us not forget that they are bound by\r\noath to remain faithful to _perpetual union_, and that there is not a\r\nfederal officer in America who has not sworn to maintain this Union.\r\n\r\nI shall not dwell on the fact that the Confederation purchased with its\r\nmoney two of the States that now pretend to secede from it; that it gave\r\nseventy-five millions to France for Louisiana, and twenty-five millions\r\nto Spain for Florida; no, I choose to appeal from this to precedents,\r\nthe authority of which is not contested, and which form, in some sort,\r\nthe interpreting commentary of the Constitution. In the last century,\r\nthe State of New York, on giving in its adhesion to the Constitution,\r\ndesired to reserve to itself this same power of seceding some day if it\r\npleased; but such a reservation was rejected. At the epoch of the war of\r\n1812 and the embargo laws, a convention of the New England States\r\nassembled at Hartford, and talked of eventual separation, whereupon the\r\nSouthern party likened all separation without consent to treason, and\r\nthis doctrine was sustained by the _Richmond Inquirer_, the organ of\r\nJefferson. When, afterwards, South Carolina, accustomed to the fact,\r\ndared proclaim that act of nullification which was the prelude to a\r\ncomplete renunciation of federal obligations, it was plainly signified\r\nto her that a revolt would be suppressed by force of arms, and she\r\nyielded on the spot. When, the other day, this same South Carolina\r\nlowered the colors of the United States, and unfurled the Palmetto flag,\r\nMr. Buchanan himself proclaimed (how could he do otherwise?) the\r\nflagrant illegality of such an act; it is true, that, after having\r\ndeclared it illegal, he took care to disavow all intention of putting\r\nthe law in force.\r\n\r\nAnd this same conduct of Mr. Buchanan is the precise explanation of the\r\nprodigious haste which the South Carolinians have used in their\r\nproceedings. They knew that the President in power could not, if he\r\nwould, act with vigor against his own party. His inaction was assured;\r\nthere were two months of interregnum, of which it was important to make\r\nthe most; so that Mr. Lincoln, on coming into office, might find himself\r\nchecked, or at least harassed, by the power of a deed accomplished.\r\n\r\nIt seems as though Mr. Buchanan was anxious himself to give the signal\r\nof revolt. The message that was issued by him, after the election of Mr.\r\nLincoln, is really the most extraordinary document ever written by the\r\nhead of a great State; he doubtless declares in it that a regular\r\nelection cannot of itself alone furnish sufficient cause for the\r\nviolence of the South; he takes care, however, to add that the South has\r\nreason to complain, that reparation and guarantees are due it, and that\r\nif these are refused, (that is, if the North refuses to replace its head\r\nunder the yoke, and to decree at once the ruin and the shame of\r\nAmerica,) it will then he time for action.\r\n\r\nThe Carolinians thought that they might be excused for being a little\r\nless prudent than the first magistrate of the United States, since,\r\nmoreover, they saw their pretensions sanctioned by him. Why not attack\r\nthe Confederation while it had a chief who was determined to make as\r\nlittle defence as possible? The weakness of Mr. Buchanan justified the\r\nconfidence of Carolina. He refrained to place in the Federal fortresses\r\ntroops destined to protect them against an expected assault; when a\r\nbrave man, Major Anderson, took measures to defend the post that had\r\nbeen confided him, this unexpected resistance by which the programme was\r\nderanged, appeared as ill-timed to Mr. Buchanan as insolent to the\r\npeople of Charleston; and the despatch of the 30th of December,\r\naddressed to their commissioners, exculpates him from the crime of\r\nhaving sent the reinforcements, and makes excuses in pitiful terms for\r\nthe conduct of Major Anderson, whom they ought to hear before\r\ncondemning. In fact, Anderson acted on his own responsibility, and\r\nincurred the blame of the Minister of War, who advised in full council\r\nthe surrender of the forts.\r\n\r\nThe American Government is as timid as the seceded States are resolute.\r\nOur generation, which has witnessed sad spectacles, has never yet,\r\nperhaps, contemplated any more humiliating. Ministers, one of whom,\r\nhardly out of the Cabinet, has gone to preside over the secession\r\nconvention at Montgomery, and another of whom has taken care to pave the\r\nway in advance for the revolt of the South, and to secure for it the\r\nresources of money, arms, and munitions, which it was about to need;\r\nministers who vote openly for the insurgents, whose financial intrigues\r\nhave been proved by investigation, and whose electoral manoeuvres,\r\nduplicated by embezzlement of public money, have ended in a sort of\r\npolitical treason, disavowed only by General Cass; a Cabinet, in the\r\nlast extremity, still essaying to continue its former course by killing\r\nwith its veto the bill adopted by the Legislature of Nebraska to\r\nprohibit slavery in its Territory; a Government falling apart by\r\npiecemeal, for fear of compromising itself by resisting some part of the\r\nSouth: do you know of any thing so shameful? Mr. Buchanan will end as he\r\nbegan: for four years, he has been struggling to obtain an extension of\r\nslavery; for a month, he has been favoring the plans of separation, by\r\nopposing his force of inertia to the growing indignation of the North.\r\n\r\nBeing unable to prevent every thing, he does at least what he can:\r\nforced to send some reinforcements, he speedily withdraws them in a\r\nmanner seemingly designed to render easy the attack on Fort Sumter and\r\nto discourage Major Anderson. In the hands of a President who understood\r\nhis duties, things would have gone on very differently. In the first\r\nplace, the South would have known on what to rely, and would have been\r\nreminded of the message of General Jackson in 1833, exacting the\r\n_immediate_ disbanding of its troops; next, preliminary measures of\r\nprecaution would not have been systematically neglected; lastly, at the\r\nfirst symptom of revolt, a sufficient number of ships of war would have\r\nbeen sent to Charleston to insure the regular collection of taxes and\r\nrespect for the Federal property. Nothing is so pacific as resolution:\r\nface to face with a strong Government, we look twice before launching\r\ninto adventures; but, with Mr. Buchanan, it was almost impossible for\r\nthe cotton States to refrain from precipitating themselves headlong into\r\nthem. The repression that will come by and by will not repair the evil\r\nthat has been done. Explanations will also follow too late; it was for\r\nthe President to reply on the spot, and categorically, to the manifestos\r\nissued by the South. To let the violent States know that their\r\nunconstitutional plans would meet a prompt chastisement; to let the\r\nneighboring States know that their sovereignty was by no means menaced,\r\nand that they would continue to regulate their internal institutions as\r\nthey pleased; to say to all that the discussion of plans of abolition\r\nwas not in question; to say too to all that the majorities of\r\nfree-soilers would be protected in the Territories, and that the\r\nconquests of slavery were ended: what language would have been better\r\nfitted than this to isolate the Gulf States--perhaps to check them?\r\n\r\nI say _perhaps_, because I know that passions had reached such a pitch\r\nof exasperation that a rupture seemed inevitable. In South Carolina, for\r\nexample, the Governor had recommended both Houses in advance to take\r\nmeasures for seceding if Mr. Lincoln should be elected; a special\r\ncommission was nominated, and held permanent session. In Texas, Senator\r\nWigfall did not fear to say, in supporting Mr. Breckenridge: \"If any\r\nother candidate is elected, look for stormy weather. There may be a\r\nConfederation, indeed, but it will not number more than thirty-three\r\nStates.\" Mr. Jefferson Davis, of Mississippi, and Mr. Benjamin, of\r\nLouisiana, held no less explicit language, announcing that at the first\r\nelectoral defeat of the South, it would set about forming a separate\r\nConfederation, long since demanded by its true interests.\r\n\r\nWhat the South called its \"interests,\" what it ended by adopting as a\r\npolitical platform, outside of which there was no safety, was, as we\r\nhave seen, the subjugation of majorities in the Territories, the\r\nrestriction of sovereignty in the Northern States, the reform of the\r\nliberty bills, which refused the prisons of these States and the\r\nco-operation of their officers, to the Federal agents charged with\r\narresting fugitive slaves, the power of transporting slavery over the\r\nwhole Confederation, the duty of extending indefinitely the domain of\r\nslavery. Who paid Walker? Who continually recruited bands of adventurers\r\nto launch on Cuba or Central America? Who prepared the well-known lists\r\nof slave States with which the South counted on enriching itself: four\r\nStates some day to be carved out of Texas, (the South had caused this to\r\nbe authorized in advance,) three States to be created in the Island of\r\nCuba, an indefinite number of States to be detached one after another\r\nfrom Central America and Mexico? Who clamorously demanded the\r\nreëstablishment of the African slave trade, alone capable of peopling\r\nthis vast extent, and of lowering the excessive price of the negroes\r\nsupplied by the producing States? The extreme South, which alone was\r\nconcerned in this, saw gigantic vistas opening before it on which it\r\nfastened with ecstasy. Now, already, in spite of the more or less avowed\r\nsupport of Mr. Buchanan, its success was already checked, it felt itself\r\nprovoked and thwarted. Henceforth, all its hopes were concentrated on\r\nthe election of 1860: we may judge, therefore, of its disappointment,\r\nand of the furious ardor with which it must have seized upon its last\r\nresource, namely, secession, which might prove in its hands either a\r\nmeans of terrifying the North, and of bringing it again under the yoke,\r\nor of entering alone into a new destiny, of having elbow-room, and of\r\ndevoting itself entirely to the propagation of slavery!\r\n\r\nThe facts are known; I do not think of recounting them. I content\r\nmyself with remarking the enthusiasm, which prevails in the majority of\r\nthe cotton States. One could not commit suicide with a better grace. It\r\nis easy to recognize a country hermetically sealed to contradiction,\r\nwhich is enchanted with itself, and which ends by accomplishing the most\r\nhorrible deeds with a sort of conscientious rejoicing. The enthusiasm\r\nwhich is displayed in proclaiming secession, or in firing on the\r\nAmerican flag, is displayed in freeing the captain of a slaver, a noble\r\nmartyr to the popular cause. There is something terrifying in the\r\nenthusiasm of evil passions. When I consider the folly of the South,\r\nwhich so heedlessly touches the match to the first cannon pointed\r\nagainst its confederates; when I see it without hesitation give the\r\nsignal for a war in which it runs the risk of perishing; when I read its\r\nlaws, decreeing the penalty of death against any one who shall attack\r\nthe Palmetto State, and its dispatches, in which the removal of Major\r\nAnderson is exacted, in the tone which a master employs toward a\r\ndisobedient servant, I ask myself whether the present crisis could\r\nreally have been evaded, and whether any thing less than a rude lesson\r\ncould have opened eyes so obstinately closed to the light.\r\n\r\nPeople have taken in earnest the plans of the Southern Confederacy.\r\nNothing could be more imposing, in fact, if they had the least chance of\r\nsuccess. The fifteen Southern States, already immense, joined to Mexico,\r\nCuba, and Central America--what a power this would be! And, doubtless,\r\nthis power would not stop at the Isthmus of Panama: it would be no more\r\ndifficult to reëstablish slavery in Bolivia, on the Equator, and in\r\nPeru, than in Mexico. Thus the \"patriarchal institution\" would advance\r\nto rejoin Brazil, and the dismayed eye would not find a single free spot\r\nupon which to rest between Delaware Bay and the banks of the Uruguay.\r\nFurthermore, this colossal negro jail would be stocked by a no less\r\ncolossal slave trade: barracoons would be refilled in Africa, slave\r\nexpeditions would be organized on a scale hitherto unknown, and whole\r\nsquadrons of slave ships (those \"floating hells\") would transport their\r\ncargoes under the Southern colors, proudly unfurled; patriotic\r\nindignation would be aroused at the mere name of the right of search,\r\nand the whole world would be challenged to defend the liberty of the\r\nseas.\r\n\r\nSuch is the project in its majestic unity. Such is the glorious ideal\r\nwhich the extreme South hoped to attain by its union with the North, and\r\nwhich it now seeks to attain by its separation. The hearts of men beat\r\nhigh at the thought, and many are ready to give their lives heroically\r\nin order to secure its realization. Alas! we are thus made; passion\r\nexcuses every thing, transfigures every thing.\r\n\r\nEach one feels instinctively, moreover, that no part of the plan can be\r\nseparated from the whole; that it must be great to be respected; that to\r\npeople this vast extent with slaves, the African slave trade is\r\nindispensable; of course, they took care not to avow all this at the\r\nfirst moment; it was necessary, in the beginning, to delude others, and\r\nperhaps themselves; it was necessary to obtain recognition. On this\r\naccount, the prudent politicians who have just drawn up the programme of\r\nthe South, have been careful to record in it the prohibition of the\r\nAfrican slave trade, and the disavowal of plans of conquest. But this\r\ndoes not prevent the necessities of the position from becoming known by\r\nand by. True programmes, adapted to the position of affairs, are not\r\nchanged from day to day. I defy the slave States, provided their\r\nConfederation succeeds in existing, to do otherwise than seek to extend\r\ntowards the South; hemmed in on all sides by liberty, incessantly\r\nprovoked by the impossibility of preventing the flight of their negroes,\r\nthey will fall on those of their neighbors who are the least capable of\r\nresistance, and whose territory is most to their convenience. This fact\r\nis obvious, as it is also obvious that they will have recourse to the\r\nAfrican slave trade to people these new possessions. It is in vain to\r\ndeny it, on account of Europe, or of the border States; the necessities\r\nwill subsist, and, sooner or later, they will be obeyed. If the border\r\nStates persist in deluding themselves on this point, and fancy that they\r\nwill always keep the monopoly of this infamous supply of negroes sold at\r\nenormous prices, this concerns them. In any case, the illusion will\r\nfinally become dispelled. It is not in the nomination of Jefferson Davis\r\nas President of the Confederate States, that we are to look for the\r\nfinal repudiation of those projects of which this politic man is in some\r\nsort the living representative.\r\n\r\nAnd when they are renewed, we shall see an invincible obstacle rise up\r\nin the way of the realization of a plan so monstrous. As soon as the\r\nAfrican slave trade is established, the domestic slave trade will cease,\r\nthe revenues of the producing States will be suppressed, the price of\r\nnegroes will fall everywhere, and the fortunes of all the planters will\r\nfall in like proportion. Can it be possible that they will accept the\r\nchances of civil war, of insurrections, and of massacres, in order to\r\nensure to themselves the risk of ruin in case of success? Can it be\r\npossible, above all, that Europe will lend a hand, as we seem to\r\nimagine, to the most audacious attack ever directed against Christian\r\ncivilization?\r\n\r\nI know that we must always make allowance for probable perfidy, and I am\r\nfar from dreaming, as times go, that chivalric Europe will refuse to\r\nserve her own interests because these interests would cost her\r\nprinciples something. No, indeed, I imagine nothing of the sort; yet I\r\nthink that I should wrong the nineteenth century if I supposed it\r\ncapable of certain things. There are sentiments which cannot be provoked\r\nbeyond measure with impunity.\r\n\r\nRemember the shudder that ran through the world when Texas, a free\r\ncountry, was transformed into slave territory as the result of the\r\nvictory of the United States; multiply the crime of Texas by ten, by\r\ntwenty, and you will have a faint image of the impression of disgust\r\nthat the Southern republic is about to call forth among us.\r\n\r\nIt is important that they should know this in advance at Charleston, and\r\nnot delude themselves as to the kind of welcome for which the Palmetto\r\nState and its accomplices have to hope. Not only will no one recognize\r\ntheir pretended independence at this time, for to recognize it would be\r\nto tread under foot the evident rights of the United States, but they\r\nwill excite one of those moral repulsions which the least scrupulous\r\npolicy is forced to take into account. It is one thing to hold slaves;\r\nit is another to be founded expressly to serve the cause of slavery on\r\nearth; this is a new fact in the history of mankind. If a Southern\r\nConfederacy should ever take rank among nations, it will represent\r\nslavery, and nothing else. I am wrong; it will also represent the\r\nAfrican slave trade, and the fillibustering system. In any case, the\r\nSouthern Confederacy will be so far identified with slavery, with its\r\nprogress, with the measures designed to propagate and perpetuate it here\r\nbelow, that a chain and whip seem the only devices to be embroidered on\r\nits flag.\r\n\r\nWill this flag cover the human merchandise which it is designed to\r\nprotect against the interference of cruisers? Will there be a country,\r\nwill there be a heart, forgetful enough of its dignity to tolerate this\r\ninsolent challenge flung at our best sympathies? I doubt it, and I\r\ncounsel the Carolinians to doubt it also. The representative of England\r\nat Washington is said to have already declared that in presence of the\r\nslave trade thus practised, his government will not hesitate to pursue\r\nslavers into the very ports of the South. France will hold no less firm\r\na tone; whatever may be the dissent as to the right of search, the\r\n_right of slave ships_, be sure, will be admitted by none; a sea-police\r\nwill soon be found to put an end to them; if need be, the punishment\r\nwill be inflicted on their crews that is in store for a much less crime,\r\nthat of piracy; these wretches will be hung with short shrift at the\r\nyard-arm, without form or figure of law.\r\n\r\nThe Carolinians deceive themselves strangely. They fancy that they will\r\nbe treated with consideration, that they will even be protected, because\r\nthey maintain the principle of free trade, and because they hold the\r\ngreat cotton market. Free trade, cotton, these are the two\r\nrecommendations upon which they count to gain a welcome in Europe. Let\r\nus see what we are to think of this.\r\n\r\nI shall not be suspected in what I am about to say of free trade--I, who\r\nhave always been its declared partisan; I, who sustained it twenty years\r\nago as candidate in the bosom of one of the electoral colleges of Paris,\r\nand who applauded unreservedly our recent commercial treaty with\r\nEngland; but man does not live by bread alone, and if ever a school of\r\ncommercial liberty should anywhere be found that should carry the\r\nadoration of its principle so far as to sacrifice to it other and\r\nnobler liberties, a school disposed to set the question of cheapness\r\nabove that of justice, and to extend a hand to whoever should offer it a\r\nchannel of exportation, maledictions enough would not be found for it.\r\nLet England take care; those who have no love for her, take delight in\r\nforetelling that her sympathies will be weighed in the balance with her\r\ninterests, and that the protection of the North risks offending her much\r\nmore than the slavery of the South. I am convinced that it will amount\r\nto nothing, and that we shall once more see how great is the influence\r\nof Christian sentiment among Englishmen. Should the reverse be true, we\r\nmust veil our faces, and give over this vile bargaining, adorned with\r\nthe name of free trade, to the full severity of public opinion.\r\n\r\nI repeat that it will amount to nothing. Moreover, do not let us\r\nexaggerate either the protective instincts of the North or the free\r\ntrade of the South. The new tariff just adopted at Washington (a grave\r\nerror, assuredly, which I do not seek to palliate) may be amended in\r\nsuch a manner as to lose the character of prohibition with which certain\r\nStates have sought to invest it. Let us not forget, that by the side of\r\nPennsylvania, which urges the excessive increase of taxes, the North\r\ncounts a considerable number of agricultural States, the interests of\r\nwhich are very different. Now, these are the States which elected Mr.\r\nLincoln, and which will henceforth have the most decisive weight on the\r\ndestinies of the Union. We may be tranquil, the protective reaction\r\nwhich has just triumphed in part will not long be victorious. All\r\nliberties cling together: the liberty of commerce will have its day in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nBut if all liberties cling together, all slaveries cling together also,\r\nand cannot be liberal at will, even in commercial matters. The Southern\r\nStates plume themselves on being thus liberal, and it is sought to give\r\nthem this reputation. However, the facts are little in harmony with\r\ntheir brilliant programme. Far from, proclaiming free trade, the\r\n\"Confederate\" States, by a formal act adopted on the 18th of February,\r\nhave maintained the tariff of 1857. They have gone further: their\r\nCongress has just established a new and relatively heavy tax, which must\r\nburden the exportation of cotton. This is not commercial liberty as I\r\nunderstand it.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, the watchword has been given, the champions of slavery\r\nhave skilfully organized their system of manoeuvre in Europe, and it is\r\ndeveloping according to their wishes. To be indignant at the new\r\ntariff, to speak only of the new tariff, to create by means of the new\r\ntariff a sort of popularity for the Southern republic--such is the end\r\nwhich they sought to attain. I doubt whether they have fully obtained\r\nit, although the South, I say it to our shame, has already succeeded in\r\nprocuring friends and praisers among us. The factitious indignation will\r\nfall without doubt; but cotton remains: at the bottom, the South counts\r\nmuch more upon cotton than free trade to bring the Old World into her\r\ninterests. On rushing into a mad enterprise, all the perils of which,\r\nenraged as it was, it could not disguise, it said to itself that its\r\ncotton would protect it. Is it not the principal and almost the only\r\nproducer of a raw material, without which the manufactures of the whole\r\nworld would stand still? Are there not millions of workmen in England\r\n(one-sixth of the whole population!) who live by the manufacture of\r\ncotton? Is not the wealth of Great Britain founded on cotton, which\r\nalone furnishes four-fifths of its exported manufactures? All this is\r\ntrue, and they are not ignorant of it at Manchester. Notwithstanding,\r\nwhat happened there the other day? An immense meeting was convoked for\r\nthe purpose of carefully examining the great cotton business, and the\r\nperils created by the present crisis. I do not know that among these\r\nmanufacturers, knowing that their interests were menaced, that among\r\nthese workmen, knowing that their means of livelihood were at stake,\r\nthat from the heart of this country, knowing that want, famine, and\r\ninsurrections might come to her door, there arose a voice, a single one,\r\nto address a word of sympathy to the Southern States, and to promise\r\nthem the slightest support. It was because there was something\r\ntranscending manufacturing supplies, and even the bread of families: the\r\nneed, I am glad to state, of protesting against certain crimes. Instead\r\nof extending a hand to the secessionists of Charleston, the English\r\nmanufacturers resolutely laid the foundation of a vast society, destined\r\nto develop on the spot the production of cotton by free labor in India,\r\nthe Antilles, and Africa. Such was their answer; and if you knew their\r\nmost secret thoughts, you would have no difficulty in discovering that\r\nthe ambition of the South, its turbulent policy, and its aggressions\r\nwithout pretext, are far from exciting the gratitude of English\r\ncommerce, or of inspiring its confidence.\r\n\r\nEvery one in England comprehends that, from the standpoint of interest,\r\nthe separation of the South is a mortal blow dealt to the cotton\r\nproduction, which will henceforth have the aid neither of credit nor\r\nentrepôts, and which is advancing towards catastrophes which may involve\r\na conflict of arms. From another and higher standpoint, the public\r\nopinion of England has not made us wait for its verdict: already its\r\nabolition societies have regained life and begun their movements;\r\nalready, under the pressure of the universal feeling, the Court of\r\nQueen's Bench has revised the affair of the negro Anderson, to deliver\r\ninto the strong hands of the metropolis a question before which the\r\njudicial authority of Canada hesitated, and to pronounce at length a\r\nverdict of acquittal.\r\n\r\nThe South has taken account in its calculations neither of man nor God.\r\nGod especially seems to have been forgotten, though it placed itself\r\nformally under his protection. Who does not shudder at the enunciation\r\nof these unheard-of plans: we will do this, then we will do that; we\r\nwill hold England through cotton, we will entice France through\r\ninfluence--we will have many negroes, much produce, and much money! And\r\nwhat will God think of it? Everywhere else but in South Carolina, this\r\nquestion would appear formidable beyond expression.\r\n\r\nIf the South has taken its wishes for realities in Europe, it has\r\ncommitted the same error in America. Its secession has some chance (and\r\nwhat a chance!) only on condition of drawing in all the glare States\r\nwithout exception; now it seems by no means probable that such a\r\nunanimity, supposing it to be gained by surprise, could ever be\r\nmaintained successfully. The negro-raising States could not possibly\r\nregard the future in the same light as the consuming States. Their\r\nrevenues are based on the value of the domestic slave trade, which bears\r\nno resemblance to that of the African slave trade. Ask Virginia or\r\nMaryland long to sustain a policy, the result of which would be to lower\r\nthe price of her slaves in one day from a thousand dollars to two cents!\r\nThis is so clearly felt in the extreme South, that the provisional\r\nconstitution, adopted at Montgomery, is drawn up with an express view to\r\nreassuring the producing States on this point. They are afraid of the\r\nAfrican slave trade! It shall not be reopened. They are anxious to sell\r\ntheir negroes! They shall be bought only of those States forming part of\r\nthe Southern Confederacy. It belongs to them to ask now whether this\r\nMontgomery constitution, adopted for a year, really guarantees any thing\r\nto them, and whether it is possible that an attempt will not be made to\r\nrevive the African slave trade, provided the Southern Confederacy\r\nsucceeds in enduring. However this may be, they are held apart by so\r\nmany causes, that they would only unite to-day to separate to-morrow. I\r\nknow well that the passions of slavery rule in many of the border\r\nStates, especially in Virginia, as violently as in the extreme South. I\r\ndo not disguise from myself that the habit of sustaining a deplorable\r\ncause in common has created between the border and the cotton States a\r\nbond of long standing and difficult to break. But I say this: the\r\nimpulses of the first hour will have their morrow; when the frontier\r\nStates witness the commencement of those territorial invasions which\r\nmust necessarily bring the African slave trade in their train; when they\r\nknow what reliance to place on the fine promises made to-day to attract\r\nthem; when they perceive that in separating from the North, they\r\nthemselves have removed the sole obstacle in the way of the flight of\r\nall their slaves; when, in fine, they feel weighing upon them, and them\r\nfirst, the perils of an armed struggle and a negro insurrection, they\r\nwill listen perhaps to those of their citizens who, even now, are urging\r\nthem to turn to the side of justice--of justice and of safety. By the\r\nfewness of their slaves, by the nature of their climate, which resembles\r\nthat of Marseilles and Montpellier, by the kind of cultivation to which\r\ntheir country is adapted, by the number of manufactures which are\r\nbeginning to be established among them, it seems as if they must be led,\r\nor, at least, some day led back, to the policy of union. This is no\r\ndiscovery: the _seceded States_ know it already; they form a separate\r\nband. America has not forgotten the retreat of the seven, which, a few\r\nmonths ago, dismembered the Democratic Convention assembled at\r\nCharleston. These seven were South Carolina, Florida, Alabama,\r\nMississippi, Arkansas, Texas, and Louisiana; in other words, all those\r\nStates which were the first to vote for secession. The same list, with\r\nthe addition of Georgia and North Carolina, appeared again on the day of\r\nthe Presidential election: these nine States alone adopted Mr.\r\nBreckenridge as their candidate.\r\n\r\nHere, then, is a profound distinction, which attaches to interests and\r\ntendencies, which has manifested itself already, which will manifest\r\nitself more and more, and which will work, sooner or later, the\r\nsalvation of the United States. The border States cannot unite with the\r\ncotton States definitively. They gave proofs of this in the last\r\nelection. Five among them, Tennessee, Kentucky, Delaware, Virginia, and\r\nMaryland, at that time took an intermediate position by making an\r\nintermediate choice: Mr. Bell. Without going so far, Missouri protested\r\nat least against the nomination of Mr. Breckenridge by casting its vote\r\nfor Mr. Douglas. Better than this, a declared adversary of slavery, Mr.\r\nBlair, was elected representative by this same slave State, Missouri, on\r\nthe day before the balloting for the presidency; and on the next day his\r\nfriends voted openly for Mr. Lincoln, while no one dared-annul their\r\nvotes, as had been done four years before. Mr. Lincoln thus obtained\r\nfifteen thousand votes in Missouri, four thousand in Delaware, fifteen\r\nhundred in Maryland, a thousand in Kentucky, and as many in Virginia.\r\nThe figures are nothing; the symptom is significant. The slave States of\r\nthis intermediate region contain in their bosom, therefore, men who do\r\nnot fear to attack the \"patriarchal institution.\" Have we not just seen\r\na Republican committee acting at Baltimore, in the midst of Maryland?\r\nHas not this same Maryland just rejected, by the popular vote, the\r\ninfamous law which its legislature had adopted, and by virtue of which\r\nfree negroes who should not quit the State would be reduced by right to\r\nslavery? When I remember these facts, so important and so recent, I\r\ncomprehend how it is that a Kentuckian holds the South at bay behind the\r\nmenaced walls of Fort Sumter, and how the cabinet of Mr. Lincoln has\r\nministers in its midst, who belong to the border States.\r\n\r\nPeople take the peculiar situation, of the border States too little into\r\naccount in looking into the future which is preparing for America. They\r\npersist in presenting to us two great confederacies, and, in some sort,\r\ntwo United States, called to divide the continent. If any thing like\r\nthis could occur, it could not endure. Doubtless, there are hours of\r\nvertigo from which we may look for every thing, even the impossible;\r\nand, who knows? perhaps the impossible most of all; nevertheless, the\r\nborder States cannot attach themselves forever to a cause which is not\r\ntheir own. By the side of the manifestations which have taken place in\r\nVirginia and South Carolina, we have already a right to cite\r\ndemonstrations of a different kind. Has not Missouri just decided\r\nprudently, that, in the matter of separation, the decisions of her\r\nlegislature shall not be valid until ratified by the whole people? This\r\nlittle resembles the eagerness with which States elsewhere rush into\r\nsecession. It is therefore probable that the United States will keep or\r\nsoon bring back into their bosom a considerable number of the border\r\nStates. By their side, the gulf States will attempt to form a rival\r\nnation, aspiring to grow towards the South. Such is the true extent of\r\nthe separation that is preparing.\r\n\r\nSuppose these projects to become, some day, realities, we may ask\r\nwhether a real weakening of the United States would be the result.\r\nSuppose even that another secession, based on different motives, which\r\nnothing foretells at present, should take place beyond the Rocky\r\nMountains; suppose that a Pacific republic should some day be founded,\r\nwould the American Confederation have reason to be greatly troubled at\r\nwitnessing the formation on her sides of the association of the gulf\r\nStates, California, and Oregon? Look at a map, and you will see that the\r\nvalley of the Mississippi, and of the lakes, and the shores of the\r\nAtlantic, are not necessarily connected either with the Gulf of Mexico,\r\n(save the indispensable outlet at New Orleans,) or the regions beyond\r\nthe great desert and the Rocky Mountains, the land of the Mormons and\r\nthe gold-diggers. Unity is not always the absolute good, and it may be\r\nthat progress must come through disruption. Who knows whether\r\ninstantaneous secession would not perform the mission of resolving\r\ncertain problems otherwise insoluble? Who knows whether slavery must\r\nnot disappear in this wise in the very effort that it makes to\r\nstrengthen itself through isolation? Who knows whether it is not\r\nimportant to the prosperity and real power of the United States to\r\nescape from theories of territorial monopoly, those evil counsellors but\r\ntoo much heeded? Who knows, in fine, whether the day will not come,\r\nwhen, the questions of slavery once settled, new federal ties will again\r\nbind to the centre the parts that stray from it to-day?\r\n\r\nI put these questions; I make no pretensions to resolve them. In any\r\ncase, the imagination has had full scope for some time past. People have\r\nnot been satisfied with the Southern Confederacy; have they not invented\r\nboth the pretended Pacific Confederacy which I have just mentioned, and\r\nthe central Confederacy, in which the border States will take shelter in\r\ncommon with two or three free States, as Pennsylvania and Indiana? Have\r\nthey not supposed, in the bargain, (for they seem to find it necessary\r\nto discover the dissolution of the Union every where at all costs,) that\r\nthe agricultural population of the West, discontented with the tariff\r\nrecently adopted, and putting in practice the new maxim, according to\r\nwhich they are to have recourse to separation, instead of pursuing\r\nreforms, will seek an asylum in Canada? I need not discuss such fables.\r\nI am convinced, for my part, that the principle of American unity is\r\nmuch more solid than people affirm; I see in the United States a single\r\nrace, and almost a single family: they may divide, they will not cease\r\nto be related. The relationship will take back its rights. For the time,\r\nhowever, secession seems to have a providential part to enact. It\r\nfacilitates, in certain respects, the first steps of Mr. Lincoln; thanks\r\nto it, the hostile majority in the Senate is blotted out, the\r\nuncertainty of the House of Representatives is decided, the Government\r\nbecomes possible. In the face of the senators and representatives of the\r\ngulf States, I do not see how Mr. Lincoln could have succeeded in\r\nacting. Did not the Senate, last year, adopt the proposition of Mr.\r\nJefferson Davis in opposition to the liberty of the Territories?\r\nCongress would have trammelled, one after another, all the measures of\r\nthe new administration. Now, on the contrary, the rôle of the victorious\r\nparty will be easy; its preponderance is assured in both Houses; the\r\nSupreme Court will cease, ere long, to represent the doctrines of the\r\nextreme South, and to issue Dred Scott decrees. This is a vast change.\r\nGeneral Cass, in truth, comprehended the interests of slavery better\r\nthan Mr. Buchanan, when he demanded that the Government should arrest\r\nwith vigor from the beginning the faintest wish of separation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nPROBABLE CONSEQUENCES OF THE CRISIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Cass was nearer right than he himself imagined. In arresting\r\nfrom the beginning the development of the plans of the South, by a\r\nvigorous attitude, and by the blockade, then easy, of Charleston, the\r\nGovernment would not only have rendered it the trifling service of\r\nmaintaining its means of opposition in Congress, but also the\r\ninappreciable boon of averting the dangers of war. What has happened, on\r\nthe contrary? Precisely what must have happened, the human heart being\r\nsuch as it is. When on one side is found all the ardor, all the\r\nactivity, all the resolution, and, into the bargain, all the apparent\r\nsuccess, while on the other is found languor, hesitation, inaction, and\r\ndisgraceful delays, it happens almost infallibly that the undecided are\r\nhurried away by the fanatics.\r\n\r\nLet the United States take care! the chances of the future incur the\r\nrisk, at this moment, of becoming more grave. To-day, the border States\r\nare on the point of declaring themselves; to-day, in consequence, it is\r\nimportant to offer to their natural irresolution the support of a policy\r\nas firm as moderate. Given over without defence to the ardent\r\nsolicitations of the extreme South, they are only too likely to yield,\r\nparticularly if the Federal Government give them reason to believe that\r\nthe separation will encounter no serious obstacle.\r\n\r\nWe must remember that ignorant communities are here in question, who are\r\nruled by their prejudices, and who have never tolerated the slightest\r\nshow of discussion upon questions connected with the subject of slavery.\r\nSuch communities are capable of committing the most egregious follies;\r\npanics, sudden resolutions, mistaken unanimities, are common among them.\r\nFormerly, kings were pitied who lived surrounded by flatterers, it was\r\nsaid (we have provided against that) that the truth never reached them;\r\nthe, planters are the only men I see to-day that can be likened to these\r\nmonarchs of olden time; neither books, nor journals, nor preachers, are\r\npermitted to point out to them their duties or their interests in the\r\nmatter of slavery.\r\n\r\nThe slightest symptom of inertia or of feebleness in the Federal\r\nGovernment at this time, will, therefore, expose the border States to\r\ngreat perils, and, through them, the whole Confederation. As easy as it\r\nwould have been, with a little energy, to prevent the evil, to confine\r\nsecession within its natural limits, and to weaken the chances of civil\r\nwar, so difficult has it become, at present, to attain the same end.\r\nPainful duties, perhaps, will be imposed on Mr. Lincoln. I wonder, in\r\ntruth, at the politicians who advise him to a \"masterly inactivity,\"\r\nthat is, who urge him to continue Mr. Buchanan! Doubtless he does right\r\nto leave to the insurgents all the odium of acting on the offensive, but\r\nhis moderation should detract nothing from his firmness, and it is even\r\nof importance that the means of action which he is about to prepare,\r\nshould manifest so clearly the overwhelming superiority of the North,\r\nthat the resistance of the South will be thereby discouraged.\r\n\r\nAdversaries of slavery are not wanting, who are almost indignant at the\r\nadoption of such measures by the new President. Did they fancy then that\r\na formidable question could be resolved without risking the repression\r\nof the assaults of force by force? Away with childishness! In electing\r\nMr. Lincoln, it was known that the cotton States were ready to protest\r\nwith arms in their hands; he was not elected to receive orders from the\r\ncotton States, or to sign the dissolution of the United States on the\r\nfirst requisition. Who wills the end, wills the means. No one,\r\ncertainly, desires, more than myself, the peaceful repression of the\r\nrebellion. May the success of the blockade render the employment of the\r\narmy useless! May the resolute attitude of the Confederation arrest the\r\nmajority of the intermediate States on the dangerous declivity upon\r\nwhich they are standing! Once let them be drawn into the circle of\r\ninfluence of the extreme South, and little chance will remain of\r\nconfining the civil war within the limits beyond which it is so\r\nimportant that it should not spread.\r\n\r\nThen will appear the _irrepressible conflict_ of Mr. Seward. Whether\r\ndesired or not, if the two Confederations are placed side by side, the\r\none representing all the slavery, the other representing all the\r\nliberty, the conflict will take place. It will take place perhaps now,\r\nperhaps a little later; however this may be, no one will have the power\r\nto hinder it. Suppose the South, thus completed, relinquish (and nothing\r\nis less certain) the opening by itself of a war in which it must perish,\r\nand its great plans of attack, against Washington, for instance, be\r\nabandoned; suppose the United States, on their side, avoid a direct\r\nattack, which might give the signal for insurrections; suppose they\r\nlimit themselves to purely maritime repression of the revolt; that,\r\nafter striking off the Southern harbors from the list of seaports, and\r\ndeclaring that custom-house duties cannot be legally paid there, they\r\nmaintain this blockade, which Europe ought to applaud; would they have\r\naverted all chances of conflict? No; alas! However temporary such a\r\nsituation might be, complaints, recriminations, and, ere long, violent\r\nreprisals, would be seen everywhere arising. Rivalries of principles,\r\nrivalries of interests, bitter memories of past injuries, such are the\r\nrocks on which peaceful policy would be in continual danger of\r\nshipwreck.\r\n\r\nWe must not cherish illusions; the chances, of civil war have been\r\nincreasing for a few weeks past with fearful rapidity. If Mr. Lincoln\r\nhas confined himself scrupulously to conservative and defensive\r\nmeasures, there has been, on the contrary, in the actions of the South,\r\na violent precipitation which has surpassed all expectancy. It is the\r\nhaste of skilful men, who attempt by a bold stroke to carry off the\r\nadvantages of a deed accomplished; it is at the same time, and chiefly,\r\nperhaps, the haste of men who have nothing to lose, the ringleaders of\r\nthe present hour. At the end of resources, the insurgent South has\r\nalready increased its taxes inordinately; it has killed public and\r\nprivate credit; it has created a disturbed revolutionary condition,\r\nintolerable in the end, which no longer permits deliberation, or even\r\nreflection. Will the South pause on such a road? It is difficult to hope\r\nit. As to the North, its plan of action is very simple, and easily\r\nmaintained: suppose even that through impossibility it should give over\r\nforcing the rebels back to their duty, who can ever imagine that it\r\nwould suffer itself to be deprived of the mouths of the Mississippi, or\r\nthat it would abandon to the rival Confederacy the capital itself of the\r\nUnion, inclosed within the slave States? Let us see things as they are:\r\nthe maintenance and development of slavery in the South will render the\r\nabolitionist proceedings of its neighbor intolerable in its eyes; if it\r\nhas not been able to endure a contradiction accompanied with infinite\r\ncircumspection, and tempered by many prudent disclaimers, how will it\r\nsupport this daily torture, a unanimous and well-founded censure, a\r\nperpetual denunciation of the infamies which accompany and constitute\r\nthe \"patriarchal institution\"? The North, on its side, will be unable\r\nto forget that, by the act of the South, without reason or pretext, the\r\nglorious unity of the nation has been broken; that the star-spangled\r\nbanner has been rent in twain; that the commercial prosperity of America\r\nhas been shaken at the same time with its greatness. Let one of those\r\nincidents then occur, that are constantly arising, a Southern slave ship\r\nstopped on the high seas by the North, a negotiation of the South\r\nthreatening to introduce Europe into the affairs of the New World, and\r\ndirectly hostilities will break out.\r\n\r\nWhat they will be in the end, I scarcely dare imagine. If the planters\r\nare forced, at present, to mount guard day and night, to prevent the\r\ninsurrectionary movements that are constantly ready to break out on\r\ntheir estates; if many families are already sending their women and\r\nchildren into safer countries; what will it be when the arrival of the\r\nforces of the North shall announce to the slaves that the hour of\r\ndeliverance has sounded? It will be in vain to deny it; their arrival\r\nwill always signify this in the sight of the South. There are certain\r\nfacts, the popular interpretation of which ends by being the true\r\ninterpretation. I have no doubt that the generals of the United States,\r\nbefore attacking the Southern Confederacy, will recommend to the\r\nnegroes to remain at peace, and will disavow and condemn acts of\r\nviolence; but what is a manifesto against the reality of things and the\r\nnecessity of situations? There is a word that I see written in large\r\nletters everywhere in the projects of the South--yes, the word\r\n_catastrophe_ is to be read there in every line. The first successes of\r\nthe South are a catastrophe; the greatness of the South will be a\r\ncatastrophe; and, if the South ever realize in part the iniquitous hopes\r\ntowards which it is rushing, the catastrophe will acquire unheard-of\r\nproportions; it will be a St. Domingo carried to the tenth power.\r\n\r\nOne cannot, with impunity, give full scope to his imagination, and, in\r\nthe year of our Lord 1861, set to work to contrive the plan of a\r\nConfederacy designed to protect and to propagate slavery. These things\r\nwill be avenged sooner or later. Ah! if the South knew how important it\r\nis that it should not succeed, if it comprehended that the North has\r\nbeen hitherto its great, its only guarantee! This is literally true; a\r\nslave country, above all, to-day, needs to be backed up by a free\r\ncountry to ensure the subsistence of an institution contrary to nature;\r\notherwise the first accident, the first war, gives it over to perils\r\nthat make us shudder. Thanks to their metropolises, our colonies were\r\nable first to keep, and afterwards to enfranchise their slaves, without\r\nsuccumbing to the task. But let a Southern Confederacy come, in which\r\nthe immigration of the whites will be naught, while the increase of the\r\nblacks will be pursued in all ways, and, in case of success, the moment\r\nwill soon arrive when many States will see themselves placed, as is the\r\ncase already with South Carolina, in presence of a number of slaves\r\nexceeding that of free men. Such a social monstrosity never existed\r\nunder the sun; even in Greece, even in Rome, even among the Mussulmans,\r\nthe total number of free men remained superior; the colonies alone,\r\nthrough the effect of the slave trade, presented an inverse phenomenon,\r\nand the colonies were consolidated with their metropolises in the same\r\nmanner that the States of the South are consolidated with those of the\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\nIn this will be found, I repeat, a most important guarantee. The South\r\nin rejecting it, and imagining itself able alone to maintain a situation\r\nwhich will become graver day by day, deludes itself most strangely. At\r\nthe hour of peril, when servile insurrection perhaps shall ravage its\r\nterritory, it will be astonished to find itself left alone in the\r\npresence of its enemy.\r\n\r\nAnd this enemy is not one that can be conquered once for all. Even\r\nafter the victory, even in times of peace, the threat of servile\r\ninsurrection will ever remain suspended over the head of the Southern\r\nConfederacy; it will be necessary always to watch, always to be on the\r\nguard, always to repress, and, to tell the truth, always to tremble. The\r\nplanters, whether they know it or not, are not preparing to sleep on a\r\nbed of roses. To labor to accomplish an iniquitous work amidst the\r\nmaledictions of the universe, to increase their estates and their slaves\r\nunder penalty of death, and to feel instinctively that they will die for\r\nhaving increased them, to tremble because of European hostility, to\r\ntremble because of American hostility, to tremble because of hostility\r\nfrom without and within--what a life! That one might accept it in the\r\nservice of a noble cause, I can comprehend; but the cause of the South!\r\nIn truth, this would be taking great pains for small wages.\r\n\r\nThe South inspires me with profound compassion. We have told it, much\r\ntoo often, that its Confederacy was easy to found. To found, yes; to\r\nmake lasting, no. Here, it is not the first step that costs--it is the\r\nsecond, it is the third. The Southern Confederacy is not viable. Let us\r\nsuppose that, to its misfortune, it has succeeded in all that it has\r\njust undertaken: Charleston is free, the border States are drawn in,\r\nthere is a new federal compact and a new President, the Northern States\r\nhave of necessity abandoned the suppression of the insurrection by\r\nforce, Europe has surmounted its repugnance and received the envoys of\r\nthe great Slave republic. All questions seem resolved; but no, not a\r\nsingle one has attained its solution.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the South must have its application. Its first article,\r\nwhether it declares it or not, exacts conquests, the absorption of\r\nMexico, for example. The fillibusters of Walker are still ready to set\r\nout, and the first moment past, when the question is to appear discreet,\r\nit is scarcely probable that they will meet with much restraint, now\r\nthat the prudence of the North is no longer at hand to counterbalance\r\nthe passions of Slavery.\r\n\r\nAdmit that this enterprise bring no difficult complications. For these\r\nnew territories, the question will be to procure negroes. The second\r\narticle of the Southern policy will find then _nolens volens,_ its\r\ninevitable application: the African slave trade will be re-established.\r\nThe richest planter of Georgia, Mr. Goulden, has taken care to set forth\r\nits necessity; mark the language which he held lately: \"You have hardly\r\nnegroes enough for the existing States; obtain the opening of the slave\r\ntrade, then you can undertake to increase the number of slave States.\"\r\n\r\nWill the official re-opening of the slave trade be some day effected\r\nwithout bringing on a storm which will destroy the new Confederacy? I\r\ncannot say. In any case, I know one thing: that the value of the slaves,\r\nand consequently that of Southern property, will experience a decline\r\ngreatly exceeding that by which it is now threatened, as it is said, by\r\nthe abolition tendencies of the North. Already, through the mere fact of\r\nsecession, the price of negroes has diminished one-half; and more than\r\none intelligent planter foresees the time when this price shall have\r\ndiminished three-fourths, perhaps nine-tenths. Southern fortunes are\r\nfalling off, therefore, with extreme rapidity, and this arises not only\r\nfrom the anticipated effects of the slave trade, but also from the\r\ncertainty of being unable henceforth to put a stop to the escape of the\r\nslaves. These escapes, taken all in all, remained insignificant, so long\r\nas the Union was maintained; there are not more than fifty thousand free\r\nnegroes in Canada. But henceforth the Southern Confederacy will have a\r\nCanada everywhere on its frontiers. How retain that slavery that will\r\nescape simultaneously on the North, and the South? The Southern republic\r\nwill be as it were the common enemy, and no one assuredly will aid it to\r\nkeep its slaves.\r\n\r\nIt must not be believed, moreover, that it will succeed long in\r\npreserving itself from intestine divisions--divisions among the whites.\r\nIf, at the first moment, when every thing is easy, unanimity is far from\r\nappearing as complete as had been foretold, it will, later, be much\r\nworse. We shall then perceive how prophetic, if I may dare say so, were\r\nthe often-quoted words of Washington's farewell address: \"It is\r\nnecessary that you should accustom yourselves to regard the Union as the\r\npalladium of your happiness and your security; that you should watch\r\nover it with a jealous eye; that you should impose silence on any who\r\nshall ever dare counsel you to renounce it; that you should give vent to\r\nall your indignation on the first effort that shall be attempted to\r\ndetach from the whole any part of the Confederation.\"\r\n\r\nA very different voice, that of Jefferson, spoke the same language. A\r\nSouthern man, addressing himself to the South, which talked already of\r\nseceding he described in thrilling words the inevitable consequences of\r\nsuch an act: \"If, to rid ourselves of the present supremacy of\r\nMassachusetts and Connecticut, we were to break up the Union, would the\r\ntrouble stop there?... We should soon see a Pennsylvanian party and a\r\nVirginian party forming, in what remained of the Confederation, and the\r\nsame party spirit would agitate public opinion. By what new weapons\r\nwould these parties be armed, if they had power to threaten each other\r\ncontinually with joining their Northern neighbors, in case things did\r\nnot go on in such or such a manner! If we were to reduce our Union to\r\nNorth Carolina and Virginia, the conflict would break out again directly\r\nbetween the representatives of these two States; we should end by being\r\nreduced to simple unities.\"\r\n\r\nIs not this the anticipated history of what is about to happen in the\r\nSouthern Confederacy, supposing it to succeed in uniting with a part of\r\nthe border States? The opening programme will last as long as programmes\r\nusually do. When the true plan of the South, veiled for a moment, shall\r\nreappear, (and it must indeed reappear, unless it perishes before it has\r\nbegun to exist;) when the question shall be to increase and be peopled,\r\nto make conquests and to reëstablish the African slave trade; when the\r\nserious purpose, in a word, shall have replaced the purpose of\r\ncircumstance, what will take place between the border States and the\r\ncotton States? The profound distinction which exists between them will\r\nthen manifest itself, even if it does not break forth before. A new\r\nSouth and a new North will be formed, as hostile perhaps as the old, and\r\nless forgiving towards each other of their mutual faults, inasmuch as\r\nthey will be embittered by misfortune. Nothing divides people like a bad\r\ncause that turns out badly. They think themselves united, they call\r\nthemselves united, until the moment when they discover that they have\r\nneither the same end nor the same mind. I do not see why the victory of\r\nMr. Lincoln will have transformed the South, and suppressed the\r\ndivergencies which separated it into two groups: that of the Gulf States\r\nvoting for Mr. Breckenridge, that of the border States voting for Mr.\r\nDouglas or Mr. Bell, and even casting ballots for Mr. Lincoln.\r\n\r\nNot only will the Gulf States, the only true secessionists, never act in\r\nconcert with the border States, but they will not be long in seeing\r\nparties spring up in their own bosom, which will be little disposed to\r\ncome to terms. A sort of feudal question, as is well known, is near\r\nobtaining a position in the South; the _poor whites_ there are two or\r\nthree times as numerous as the planters. The struggle of classes may,\r\ntherefore, break out as soon as the effected secession shall have\r\nbanished to the second rank the struggle against the adversaries of\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nThe impoverishment of the South will not aid in calming its intestine\r\nquarrels. European immigration, already so meagre in the slave States,\r\n(Charleston is the only large American city whose population has\r\ndecreased, according to the last census,) European immigration, I say,\r\nwill evidently diminish still more when the South shall have taken an\r\nindependent and hostile position opposite the Northern States. Who will\r\ngo then to expose himself lightly to the fearful chances which the first\r\nwar with any country, American or European, may bring in its train? And\r\ncredit will go the same way as immigration: to lend money to planters,\r\nwhose entire property is continually menaced with destruction, is one of\r\nthose hazardous operations from which commerce is accustomed to recoil.\r\nDeprived of the capital furnished it by New York, obtaining only with\r\ngreat difficulty a few onerous and precarious advances in Europe, the\r\nSouth will see itself smitten at once in all its means of production;\r\nand, after the harvest of 1860, which secures our supplies for a year,\r\nafter that of 1861, which it will succeed, probably, in gathering, but\r\nwhich it will be more difficult to sell, it is not easy to divine how it\r\nwill set to work to continue its crops. While the South produces less\r\ncotton, and we lose the habit of buying of it, the cotton culture will\r\nbecome acclimated elsewhere; the future will thus be destroyed like the\r\npresent; final ruin will approach with hasty strides.\r\n\r\nThey tell us of a loan that the new Confederacy designs to contract!\r\nUnless it be transformed into a forced loan, I have little faith in its\r\nchance. They add that it will be only necessary to establish on exported\r\ncotton a duty of a few cents per pound, and the coffers of the South\r\nwill be filled. But, in the first place, to export cotton, they must\r\nproduce it--they must have money; it is almost impossible that the State\r\nshould be rich when all its citizens are in distress; then the\r\nexportation itself will be exposed to some difficulties if the United\r\nStates organize a blockade. And I say nothing of the bad effect that\r\nwill be produced by this tax _à la Turque_--this tax on exportation in\r\nthe very midst of plans of commercial freedom. Neither do I speak of the\r\neffect which this extra charge, which is termed trifling, but which is,\r\nin fact, considerable, will have on the sale of American cotton,\r\nalready so defective, when compared with the average price of other\r\ncottons.\r\n\r\nPoor country, which blind passion, and, above all, indomitable pride,\r\nprecipitates into the path of crime and misery! Poor, excommunicated\r\nnation, whose touch will be dreaded, whose flag will be suspected, whose\r\ncontinually increasing humiliations will not even be compensated by a\r\nfew meagre profits! The heart is oppressed at the thought of the clear,\r\ncertain, inevitable future, which awaits so many men, less guilty than\r\nerring. Between them and the rest of the world there will be nothing\r\nlonger in common; they will establish on their frontier a police over\r\nbooks and journals, essaying to prevent the fatal introduction of an\r\nidea of liberty: the rest of the world will have for them neither\r\npolitical sympathies, nor moral sympathies, nor religious sympathies.\r\n\r\nWill they at least have the consolation of having killed the United\r\nStates? Will a glorious confederation have perished by their retreat?\r\nNo, a thousand times no. Even though they should succeed in drawing the\r\nborder States into the Southern Confederacy, the United States, thank\r\nGod! will keep their rank among nations. Where will the United States\r\nbe after secession? Where they were before; for a long time the\r\ngravitation of their power has been tending towards the Northwest. The\r\ntrue America is there, that of ancient traditions, and that of present\r\nreality. If any serious fears might have been conceived as to its\r\nduration, they disappeared on the day of the election of Mr. Lincoln. On\r\nthat day, we all learned that the United States would subsist, and that\r\ntheir malady was not mortal.\r\n\r\nGreat news was this! Did you ever ask yourself how much would be missing\r\nhere on earth if such a people should disappear? It lives and it will\r\nlive. Look at the calm and confident air of the North, and compare it\r\nwith the noisy violence of the South. The North is so sure of itself\r\nthat it does not deign either to become angered, or to hasten; it even\r\ncarries this last to extremes. It has the air of knowing that, in spite\r\nof the apparent successes which may mark the first efforts of the South,\r\nthe final success must be elsewhere. Let the South take care! to have\r\nagainst it both right and might is twice as much as is needed to be\r\nbeaten. The North supported Mr. Buchanan because it was awaiting Mr.\r\nLincoln. Mr. Lincoln came, the North still has patience, but will end\r\nby falling into line, and the serious struggle will begin, in case of\r\nneed.\r\n\r\nThe final issue of this struggle can scarcely be doubtful. On one side,\r\nI see a confederacy divided, impoverished, bending under the weight of a\r\ncrushing social problem, seeing constantly on its horizon the menace of\r\ninsurrections and of massacres, unable either to negotiate, or to draw\r\nthe sword, or to resolve any of the difficulties from without, without\r\nthinking of the still more formidable difficulties from within; on the\r\nother side, I see the United States, masters of themselves, unanimous,\r\nknowing what they want, and placing at the service of a noble cause, a\r\npower which is continually increasing.\r\n\r\nThe match will not be equal. I cannot help believing, therefore, that\r\nthe triumph of the North will be even much more complete than we imagine\r\nto-day. I do not know what is to happen, but this I know: the North is\r\nmore populous, richer, more united; European immigration goes only to\r\nthe North, European capital goes only to the North. Of what elements is\r\nthe population of the South composed? The first six States that\r\nproclaimed their separation number exactly as many slaves as freemen.\r\nWhat a position! Is it probable indeed that this confederation contrary\r\nto nature, in which each white will be charged with guarding a black,\r\ncan afford a long career? The South, divided, weakened, bearing in its\r\nside the continually bleeding wound of slavery, reduced to choose in the\r\nend between the direful plans which must destroy after having dishonored\r\nit, and the Union which consolidates its interests while thwarting its\r\npassions--is it possible that the South will not return to the Union?\r\n\r\nSomething tells me that if the Union be dissolved, it will be formed\r\nagain. A lasting separation is more difficult than is imagined. Face to\r\nface with Europe, face to face with the United States, the great\r\nrepublic of the South would find it too difficult to live. To live at\r\npeace is impossible; to live without peace is not to be thought of. The\r\ngreat Southern republic must perish surely by its failure, and still\r\nmore surely by its success, for this monstrous success will draw down\r\nits destruction. There is in America a necessity, as it were, of union.\r\nUnity is at the foundation, diversity is only on the surface; unity is\r\nbound up with the national life itself, with race, origin, belief,\r\ncommon destiny, a like degree of civilization, in a word, with profound\r\nand permanent causes; diversity proceeds from the accidents of\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nLooking only at the province of interests, is it easy to imagine an\r\nirremediable rupture between New York and Charleston, between the valley\r\nof the Mississippi and New Orleans? What would the valley of the\r\nMississippi be without New Orleans, and New Orleans, isolated from the\r\nvast country of which it is the natural market? Can you fancy New York\r\nrenouncing half her commerce, ceasing to be the broker of cotton, the\r\nnecessary medium between the South and Europe? Can you fancy the South\r\ndeprived of the intervention and credit which New York assures her? The\r\ndependence of the North and the South is reciprocal; if the South\r\nproduces the cotton, it is the North which furnishes the advances, then\r\npurchases on its own account or on commission, and expedites the traffic\r\nwith Europe. In the United States, every part has need of the whole;\r\nagricultural States, manufacturing States, commercial States, they form\r\ntogether one of the most homogeneous countries of which I know. I should\r\nbe surprised if such a country were destined to become forever\r\ndismembered, and that, too, at an epoch less favorable to the\r\ndismemberment of great nations than to the absorption of small ones.\r\n\r\nShall I say all that I think? When Anglo-Saxons are in question, we\r\nLatins are apt to deceive ourselves terribly; one would not risk much,\r\nperhaps, in supposing that events would take place precisely in the\r\nreverse of our hypothesis. We have loudly predicted in Europe the end of\r\nthe United States, the birth and progress of a rival Confederacy, an\r\nirremediable separation: is not this a reason for supposing that there\r\nwill be ultimately neither a prolonged separation, nor a rival\r\nConfederacy worthy of consideration? Free countries, especially those of\r\nthe English race, have a habit of which we know little: their words are\r\nexceedingly violent, and their actions exceedingly circumspect. They\r\nmake a great noise: one would say that every thing was going to\r\ndestruction; but it is prudent to look at them more closely, for these\r\ncountries of discussion are also countries of compromise, the victors\r\nare accustomed to terminate political crises by yielding something of\r\ntheir victory; in appearance, it is true, rather than in reality. Fully\r\ndecided at heart, they consent willingly to appear less positive in\r\nform.\r\n\r\nHere, I know that the extreme violence of the South renders a compromise\r\nvery difficult, at least a present compromise. As it is accustomed to\r\nrule, and will be content with no less, as it knows that the North,\r\ndecidedly emancipated, will not replace its head beneath the yoke, it\r\nseems resolved to incur all risks rather than renounce its fixed idea.\r\nFor two months, the probabilities of compromise have been becoming\r\nconstantly weaker. But if we have scarcely a right to count on them now,\r\nso far as the Gulf States are concerned, we must remember that the\r\nborder States are at hand, that they are hesitating between the North\r\nand the South, and that certain concessions may be made to them, to\r\nprevent their separation.\r\n\r\nSuch is the true character of the discussions relating to compromise.\r\nConfined to these limits, they nevertheless possess a vast interest, for\r\nthe party which the border States are about to choose, and that to which\r\nthey will perhaps attach themselves afterwards, will have a great\r\ninfluence over the general course of the crisis. The point in question\r\nis no longer, doubtless, to retain Virginia, whose well-known passions\r\nimpel her to the side of Charleston, but to induce the other States to\r\ntake an attitude in conformity with their interests and their duties. It\r\nwill not, therefore, be useless to give an account of the disposition\r\nthat prevails among many Americans with respect to compromise.\r\n\r\nWhat was produced by that Peace Conference, convoked with so much noise\r\nby Virginia, the ancient political State, the country of Washington,\r\nJefferson, Madison, and Monroe? Nothing worth the trouble of mentioning.\r\nA considerable number of States refused to be present at this\r\nconference, which, had it been general, would have become transformed\r\ninto a convention, and have annulled Congress, in point of fact, then in\r\nsession in the same city? Its plan, accepted with great difficulty by a\r\nfactitious majority, never appeared to have much chance of adoption. The\r\npoint in question, above all, was to decide that, below a fixed\r\nlatitude, the majority of the inhabitants of a Territory could not\r\nprohibit the introduction of slavery, (disguised, it is true, under the\r\neuphuistic expression, \"involuntary servitude;\") this measure was to be\r\ndeclared irrevocable, unless by the unanimous consent of the States.\r\nDespite the support of Mr. Buchanan, and that of the higher branches of\r\ntrade in New York, seconded, as usual, by some fashionable circles of\r\nBoston, the almost unanimous public opinion of the North forbade all\r\nbelief in the success of such an amendment to the Constitution, which,\r\nin accordance with the Constitution itself, could be adopted only on\r\ncondition of uniting two-thirds of the votes of Congress to the\r\naffirmative votes of three-fourths of the States composing the\r\nConfederation.\r\n\r\nAnother project was put forward: all the members of Congress were to\r\ntender their resignation, and the new elections were to manifest the\r\ndefinitive will of the country on the question of slavery. That is, from\r\nthe intense excitement of the country, were to be demanded some final\r\nelements of reaction, some means of disavowing the election of Mr.\r\nLincoln. In either case, it would have been thus proved by an\r\nexceptional act that an election which is not ratified by the South may\r\nrightfully demand extraordinary measures. Now, there is nothing but what\r\nis customary, simple, and right, in the conduct of the North; it knows\r\nit, and will not, I think, permit such an advantage to be gained over\r\nit. To allow talking, to allow propositions, and to go its own way, this\r\nis the programme to which it is bound to remain faithful. What makes its\r\nhonor makes also its strength: this is the privilege of good causes.\r\n\r\nThe North has not to seek bases for a compromise. They are all laid\r\ndown, and I dare affirm, whatever may happen, that to these bases,\r\nconstantly the same, it will not fail to return, provided, at least,\r\nthat the era of compromises shall not be closed, and that the South\r\nshall not have succeeded in imposing on the North a decidedly abolition\r\npolicy. To speak truly, it has but one declaration to make: to proclaim\r\nanew the constitutional law, by virtue of which each State sovereignly\r\ndecides its own affairs, and consequently excludes all interference of\r\nCongress in the matter of slavery. Perhaps, alas! it will join, if need\r\nbe, to this declaration, which it has never refused, the promise to\r\nrespect to the utmost of its power, the principle of the restitution of\r\nfugitive slaves, which, unhappily, is also based upon the Constitution.\r\nBut, on this point, promises are worth what they will fetch, for\r\ndoubtless no one will imagine that it is easier to constrain the free\r\nStates to accomplish an odious deed which is revolting to their\r\nconscience since they have verified their strength by electing Mr.\r\nLincoln. Lastly, upon the ruling question, that of the Territories, the\r\ntheory of the North evinces justice and clearness; between the ultra\r\nabolitionists, who wish Congress to interfere to close by force all the\r\nTerritories to slavery, and the South, which wishes Congress to\r\ninterfere to open by force all the Territories to slavery, it adopts\r\nthis middle position: all the inhabitants of the Territories shall open\r\nor close them to slavery, according to their will. It is the right of\r\nthe majority, recognized there as elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI am not ignorant that Mr. Seward has gone much farther in the path of\r\nconcession, and it is not absolutely impossible that these counsels of\r\nweakness may prevail. We must be prepared for any thing in this respect.\r\nNevertheless, the President has by no means continued the imprudent\r\nwords of his future prime minister. The language of Mr. Lincoln was\r\nremarkably clear in his inaugural speech, to go no further back,\r\nindicating on the spot the true, the great concession which, till new\r\norders, may be made to the South: \"Those who elected me placed in the\r\nplatform presented for my acceptance, as a law for them and for me, the\r\nclear and explicit resolution which I am about to read to you: 'The\r\nmaintenance intact of the right of the States, and especially of the\r\nright which each State possesses to regulate and exclusively control its\r\ninstitutions according to its own views, is essential to that balance of\r\npower, on which depend the perfection and duration of our political\r\nstructure; and we denounce the invasion in contempt of the law by an\r\narmed force of the soil of any State or Territory, upon whatever pretext\r\nit may be, as the greatest of crimes.'\" Mr. Lincoln adds further:\r\n\"Congress has adopted an amendment to the Constitution, which, however,\r\nI have not seen, the purpose of which is to provide that the Federal\r\nGovernment shall never interfere in the domestic institutions of the\r\nStates, including those which relate to persons held in service. In\r\norder to avoid all misunderstanding concerning what I have said, I\r\ndepart from my intention of not speaking of any amendment in particular,\r\nto say that, considering this clause henceforth as a constitutional law,\r\nI have no objection that it be rendered explicit and irrevocable.\"\r\n\r\nConcerning fugitive slaves, the inaugural discourse cites the text of\r\nthe federal Constitution, which decides the question for the present;\r\nbut he does not ignore the fact that this constitutional decision is as\r\nwell executed as it can be, \"the moral sense of the people lending only\r\nan imperfect support to the law.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the Territories, Mr. Lincoln declares clearly that the minority\r\nmust submit to the majority, under penalty of falling into complete\r\nanarchy. Neither does he hesitate on the subject of the decisions of the\r\nSupreme Court; these decrees, in his eyes, are merely special decisions\r\nrendered in particular cases, and detracting nothing from the right\r\nwhich the Confederation possesses to regulate its institutions and its\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nAll this is very firm, without being provoking. The limit of\r\nconcessions is marked out, and a conciliatory spirit is maintained. It\r\nis above all in disclosing his line of conduct towards the rebellious\r\nStates, that Mr. Lincoln happily resolves the problem of abandoning none\r\nof the rights of the Confederation, while manifesting the most pacific\r\ndisposition, and leaving to others the odium of aggression. His doctrine\r\non this point may be summed up in this wise: in the first place, the\r\nseparation is unconstitutional, it should be, it will be combated,\r\nnothing on earth can bring the President to accede to the destruction of\r\nthe Union; in the second place, he will not be the aggressor, he will\r\nendeavor to shun a war which exposes the South to fearful perils; in the\r\nthird place, he will fulfill the duty of preserving federal property and\r\ncollecting federal taxes in the South. In other terms, he will employ\r\nthe means which should have been employed on the first day, and which\r\nwould have then been more efficacious. He will attempt the establishment\r\nof a maritime blockade, in order to reduce the rebellion of the whites\r\nwithout provoking the insurrection of the negroes. Already, the vessels\r\nof war have been recalled from distant stations. Alas! I have little\r\nhope that the precautions dictated to Mr. Lincoln by prudence and\r\nhumanity will bear their fruits. The South raises an army and is about\r\nto attack Fort Sumter, knowing that it will thus expose itself to a\r\nformidable retribution. Mr. Lincoln, in fact, has not left it in\r\nignorance of this: \"In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow-citizens, in\r\nyours and not mine, is found the terrible question of civil war. The\r\nGovernment will not attack you; you will have no conflict, if you are\r\nnot the aggressors. You have not, on your part, an oath registered in\r\nheaven to destroy the Government; whilst I, on my side, am about to take\r\nthe most solemn oath to maintain, to protect and defend it.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the respective position. Men will agitate, are agitating\r\nalready, about the new President, to take away from his thoughts and\r\ndesigns this resolute character which makes their force. They attempt to\r\ndemonstrate to him, not only that Fort Sumter, so easy to revictual\r\nunder Mr. Buchanan, has now become inaccessible to aid, and that no\r\nother course remains than to authorize its surrender; but that Fort\r\nPickens itself should be surrendered to the South, in order to reserve\r\nevery chance of reconciliation and in no degree to assume the\r\nresponsibility of civil war! I hope that Mr. Lincoln will know how to\r\nresist these enfeebling influences. After having demonstrated to him\r\nthat it is necessary to deliver up the forts, they will demonstrate to\r\nhim that it is necessary to renounce the blockade, which is not tenable\r\nwithout the forts; then, who knows? they will demonstrate to him finally\r\nthat it is necessary to sign some disgraceful compromise, and submit\r\nalmost to the law of the rebels.\r\n\r\nOnce more, it is prudent to foresee every thing, and it is for this that\r\nI mention such things. I count, moreover, on their not being realized.\r\nIn electing Mr. Lincoln, the United States decided thus: Slavery will\r\nmake no more conquests. What they have decided, they will ultimately\r\nmaintain, even though they should have the air of abandoning it. They\r\nhave respected and they will respect the sovereignty of the States; upon\r\nthis point they will give all the guarantees that may be desired, and\r\nCongress, we have seen, has already voted an amendment to the\r\nConstitution, designed to offer this basis of compromise. But they will\r\ngo no further than this; the North must feel that, of all ways of\r\nterminating the present crisis, the most fatal would be the disavowal of\r\nprinciples and the desertion of the flag.\r\n\r\nThe compromises that promise any thing more than respect for the\r\nsovereignty of the States in the matter of slavery, promise more than\r\nthey could perform; every one feels this, in the South as in the North.\r\nThe policy of the South forms a whole of which nothing subsists if any\r\nthing be retrenched, and above all if the complicity of the Government\r\nceases to be assured to it. On the day that the South accepts any\r\ncompromise whatever, it will have renounced, not the maintenance\r\ndoubtless, but the propagation of slavery; it will have renounced its\r\nrule. Compromises, (there will be such, perhaps, let us swear to\r\nnothing; before or after the war, with the entire South, or with a part\r\nof it,) compromises will be signed henceforth without any delusion. The\r\nSouth knows, marvellously well, that these compromises will bear little\r\nresemblance to those signed in former times. Those marked, by their\r\nconstantly increasing pretension, the upward march of the South; these\r\nwill mark the phases of its decline. How many changes which can never be\r\nretraced! No more conquests to promote slavery, no more reopening of the\r\nAfrican slave trade, no more impunity secured to those numerous\r\nslave-ships which daily, to the knowledge and in the sight of all, for\r\nyears past, have quitted the ports of the Confederation; no more chance\r\nof equalling, by the creation and population of new States, the rapid\r\ndevelopment of the North; henceforth the question is ended, the South\r\nmust be resigned to it: the majority of the free States will become such\r\nthat it can be contested neither in the House of Representatives, nor in\r\nthe Senate, nor in the presidential election; the supremacy resides at\r\nthe North, the programme of the South is rent in a thousand pieces.\r\n\r\nAgainst this, all the compromises in the world can do nothing. If Mr.\r\nLincoln is the first President opposed to slavery, Mr. Buchanan is the\r\nlast President favorable to slavery; the American policy is henceforth\r\nfixed. Reflect, in fact, on what these four years of government will\r\nproduce. The result is so enormous, that, unhappily, one might be\r\ntempted to say at Washington: \"We will do all that is wished, provided\r\nwe preserve the handling of affairs.\"\r\n\r\nThe power of a President is doubtless inconsiderable, but his advent is\r\nthat of a party. This party is about to renew all administrations, great\r\nand small; the same majority which has elected him will modify before\r\nlong the tendencies of the courts; in fine, the general affairs of the\r\nUnion will be managed in a new spirit. It was advancing in one\r\ndirection, it is about to move in the opposite. Mr. Lincoln is not one\r\nto shut his eyes on filibustering attempts to strive to take Cuba for\r\nthe slavery party, to permit States to be carved out of Mexico, and\r\nothers to be made ready by subdividing Texas. The process which is about\r\nto be accomplished reminds me of the measures taken to combat a vast\r\nconflagration: the first thing done is to circumscribe its locality.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the four years of Mr. Lincoln's administration, the flames\r\nwhich threatened to devour the Union will be completely hemmed in.\r\nConsidering the United States as a whole, and independently of the\r\nincidents of separation, we are justified in believing that the\r\nrespective number of free and of slave States will leave no chance for\r\nthe ulterior extension of a great scourge. Do we delude ourselves by\r\nthinking that the progress already begun in the border States will have\r\nbeen accelerated in its course, and that many of them will have freely\r\npassed over to the side of liberty? Is it certain, moreover, that the\r\nhesitation of some of the churches will have ceased, and that the\r\ninfluence of the Gospel, so decisive in America, will have finally\r\nplaced itself entire at the service of the good cause?\r\n\r\nLet there be a compromise or not, let the great secession of the South\r\nbe prevented or not, let civil war break forth or not, let it give or\r\nnot give to the South the fleeting eclat of first successes, one fact\r\nremains settled henceforth: the United States were tottering on their\r\nbase, they have regained their equilibrium; the deadly perils which they\r\nlately incurred from the plans of conquest of the South and the\r\nindefinite extension of slavery, are at length conjured down; they have\r\nno longer to ask whether, some day, the South having grown beyond\r\nmeasure, secession must not be effected by the North, leaving in the\r\nhands of the slaveholders the glorious name and the starry banner of the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nI think that I have gone over the whole series of hypotheses which offer\r\nany probability. I have been careful to adopt none of them, for I make\r\nno pretension, thank God, to read the future. It would be puerile to\r\nprognosticate what will happen, and not less puerile, perhaps, to\r\ndescribe it from what has happened. In the face of the accidents in\r\ndifferent directions which are attracting public attention and filling\r\nthe columns of newspapers, I have attempted to make a distinction\r\nbetween what may happen and what must endure. The lasting consequences\r\nof the present crisis are what I proposed to investigate faithfully. The\r\nreader knows what are my conclusions. It may be that it will end in the\r\nadoption of some blamable compromise; but whatever may be inscribed in\r\nit, the election of Mr. Lincoln has just written in the margin a note\r\nthat will annul the text. The time for certain concessions is past, and\r\nthe South has no more doubts of it than the North. It may be that the\r\nslave States will succeed in founding their deplorable Confederacy, but\r\nit is impossible that they should succeed in making it live; they will\r\nperceive that it is easier to adopt a compact or to elect a President,\r\nthan to create, in truth, in the face of the nineteenth century, the\r\nnationality of slavery.\r\n\r\nI have, therefore, the right to affirm that, whatever may be the\r\nappearances and incidents of the moment, one fact has been accomplished\r\nand will subsist: the United States were perishing, and are saved. Yes,\r\nwhatever may be the hypothesis on which we pause, three new and decisive\r\nfacts appear to our eyes: we know that the North henceforth has the\r\nmastery; we know that the perils which threaten the Union came from the\r\nSouth and not from the North; we know that the days of the \"patriarchal\r\ninstitution\" are numbered. Beneath these three facts, it is not\r\ndifficult to perceive the uprising of a great people.\r\n\r\nThe victory of the North, the consciousness which it has of its\r\nstrength and of its fixed resolution, whatever may be the appearances to\r\nthe contrary, to circumscribe an evil which was ready to overflow on\r\nevery side, is the first fact; there is no need to return to it.\r\n\r\nAs to the second, Carolina and Georgia have charged themselves with\r\nbringing it to light. They have proved by their acts that abolitionism\r\nhad been calumniated in accusing it of menacing the unity of the United\r\nStates. The secessionist passions have shown themselves in the other\r\ncamp; there, upon the mere news of a regular election, have been\r\nsacrificed unhesitatingly the greatness, and, it would seem, the very\r\nexistence of the country. The proclamations from Charleston, and the\r\nshots fired on the Federal flag, have apprised us of what intelligent\r\nobservers suspected already: that the States for which slavery had\r\nbecome a passion and almost a mission, must some day experience the need\r\nof procuring to such a cause the security of isolation.\r\n\r\nAnd in acting in this wise, these States, strange to say, have\r\nthemselves stated the problem of abolition. No one thought of it, it may\r\nbe said; every one respected the constitutional limits of their\r\nsovereignty. They would not have it thus; they carried the question\r\ninto the territory of Federal right and Federal relations; they\r\nexclaimed: \"Secure the extension of slavery, and perish the United\r\nStates!\" If the United States had perished, there would not have been\r\nmaledictions deep enough for those who had committed such a crime. The\r\nUnited States will not perish; but they will long remember with\r\ngratitude what they owe to the secessionists of 1860. When the hour of\r\nemancipation shall have struck, and it will strike some day, the\r\nsecessionists of 1860 will not probably speak of their rights to\r\nindemnity; they have just given a quittance of it in cannon balls.\r\n\r\nThe third fact remains: Is it true that, in all the hypotheses, the\r\ncause of the negroes has just realized such progress that the ultimate\r\nissue of the contention can no longer be doubtful? This is most obvious.\r\nLet there be separation or not, slavery has just entered upon the road\r\nwhich leads to abolition, more or less rapid, but infallible. If there\r\nbe no separation, this immense progress will he effected with more\r\nwisdom and slowness; violent means will be averted, the benevolent\r\ninfluence of the Gospel will pave the way for progressive and peaceful\r\ntransformation by preaching, to the slaves as to the masters, more of\r\ntheir duties than of their rights. If there be separation, emancipation\r\nwill be accomplished much more quickly and more calamitously. Servile\r\nwar will break out; ultra abolitionism, to which hitherto the prudence\r\nof the North has refused all real credit, will be no longer restrained\r\nby the prudence of a people desirous of shunning bloody catastrophes;\r\nsustained by the increasing animosity which will inflame the two\r\nConfederacies against each other, it will find means of introducing into\r\nthe South appeals to revolt, and will multiply expeditions like that of\r\nJohn Brown.\r\n\r\nBut let us leave these generalities, and examine nearer by, from the\r\nstand-point of emancipation, the four or five hypotheses which we have\r\nsignalled out most plainly, and between which seem to lie the chances of\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nI shall examine first of all the one whose realization is evidently\r\npursued by the able men of the extreme South. The question is, after\r\nhaving speedily gained over the North, thanks to Mr. Buchanan, to arrive\r\nas quickly as possible at something which shall have the appearance and\r\nauthority of a fact accomplished. Audacity, and again audacity; upon\r\nthis point, the politic and the violent meet in unison to-day. It has\r\nseceded, it has invaded the Federal property, it has trumped up a\r\ngovernment, it has given itself a President, it is about to have an\r\narmy, it is already attempting to represent itself officially at the\r\ncourts of the great powers.\r\n\r\nBy the side of audacity, prudence has played its part. It has taken good\r\ncare not to unfurl its flag, it has made itself small, modest, moderate,\r\nas much so, at least, as the passions of the mob would permit; it asked\r\nnothing, in truth, but to live honestly in a corner of the globe. Who\r\nspeaks, then, of conquests? Who would wish to re-establish the African\r\nslave trade on a large scale? Far from being retrogrades, the men of the\r\nSouth are champions of progress; witness their programme of commercial\r\nfreedom! Are there no honest men to be found in the North, to restrain\r\nMr. Lincoln, and to prevent him from oppressing them? Are there no\r\ngovernments in Europe that can interpose, and recommend the maintenance\r\nof peace? Is not this peace, which prevents the insurrections of\r\nnegroes, and the destruction of cotton, for the interest of all? Why\r\nshould there not be two Confederacies, living side by side, as good\r\nfriends?\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the able party tend to this, and that the violent\r\nhave allowed them to give, for the common interest, this subdued tone to\r\nthe insurrectionary movement. The able party know too well what a\r\nprolonged war would be to desire it. They prepare for it in the hope, if\r\nnot to avoid it entirely, at least to prevent its duration, and to\r\nobtain at once, in behalf of Southern secession, that species of\r\nsecurity which is conferred in our times by the deed accomplished.\r\nPerhaps the United States, yielding to a sentiment which certainly has\r\nsomething honourable in it, will allow the Confederacy of the Gulf\r\nStates to subsist, rather than crush it, which would be but too easy, by\r\nbringing upon it a war which would be accompanied by slave\r\ninsurrections. Let us not be in haste to blame such a course; let us\r\nremember that the whole world is prompting in this direction, that all\r\nthe counsels given to Mr. Lincoln, in the Old World as in the New, begin\r\ninvariably with the words: \"Strive to avoid civil war;\" let us remember\r\nalso that, to solve the American problem, much more time will be needed\r\nthan we imagine in Europe; let us endeavor to put ourselves in the place\r\nof those who see things as they are, and who find themselves in a\r\nstruggle with the difficulties.\r\n\r\nPatience will doubtless have here its great inconveniencies; the\r\nConfederacy of the cotton States, if combated without vigor, will seem\r\nthe living proof of the right of separation; it will be an asylum all\r\nprepared, in which the discontented border States can take refuge at\r\nneed. Nevertheless the question is to tolerate this Confederacy, but by\r\nno means to recognize the legitimacy of the act which gave it birth; the\r\nquestion is to make use of a generous forbearance, to which new threats\r\nof secession will necessarily put an end. Then, is it nothing to\r\nmanifest a spirit of peace fitted to touch the most prejudiced, to bind\r\nthe majority of the border States to the destinies of the Union, to give\r\nevidence of the distinction which exists between them and the extreme\r\nSouth, to force them, in fine, to declare themselves? If they surmount\r\nthe present temptation, (and they will never encounter a stronger one,)\r\nif they consent to sacrifice their immediate interests, and to renounce\r\nthe traffic in slaves, which is in danger of ceasing from day to day in\r\ncase they do not join the \"Confederate States;\" is such a resolution\r\nnothing? does it contain no guarantees for the future? We do not set\r\nfoot in the right path with impunity; honorable resolves always carry us\r\nfurther, thank God! than we counted on going. Suppose even that the\r\nborder States which refuse to unite with the South design to impose on\r\nthe North certain vexatious conditions, they will be none the less\r\nturned from their former alliances, they will have none the less begun\r\nto move in a new direction. We should do wrong if we did not recognize\r\nhow honorable is the conduct of several among them; in watching over\r\ntheir legislatures, in enacting that the vote of secession shall be\r\nsubmitted to the ratification of the whole people, certain frontier\r\nStates seem to have already shown themselves resolved to foil the\r\nintrigues at Charleston.\r\n\r\nThe cause of emancipation takes, therefore, a very important step in\r\nadvance, in the hypothesis of a Southern Confederacy reduced, or nearly\r\nso, to the Gulf States alone. Limited secession is perhaps of all\r\ncombinations, the one most favorable to the suppression of slavery.\r\nPicture to yourself, in fact, what this Southern Confederacy will he. It\r\nwill be an impossible, short-lived republic, the separation of which\r\nwill one day cease, and which, meanwhile, will be incapable of realizing\r\nany of its favorite projects. From the first hour, the extreme South\r\nfound itself brought to face a dilemma: either to draw in all the slave\r\nStates, and then to await the moment favorable to the execution of its\r\ngrandiloquent plans, to hasten towards its destiny, its ideal, to\r\nconquer territories, to people them with negroes, and to perish through\r\nthe accomplishment of an impious work; or, to remain alone and undertake\r\nnothing, and still perish, but this time through impotence to exist.\r\nWhat is to be done when there is only the miserable Confederacy of some\r\nthousand whites, the owners and keepers of some hundred thousand blacks?\r\nMake conquests? They dare not. Open the slave trade? It would draw down\r\ndestruction upon them.\r\n\r\nNow, mark that, in the bosom of a Confederacy morally isolated from the\r\nentire world, receiving aid neither from immigrants nor capital,\r\ndeprived, in a large part at least, of the fresh supply of negroes which\r\nit formerly drew from the North, unable even to incur the risk of\r\nimitating Spain, which buys _free_ negroes from the slave-hunters of the\r\nAfrican continent, not in a condition to stop the escapes which will\r\ntake place on all her frontiers, the question of slavery will proceed\r\nnecessarily towards its solution. The extreme South, strange to say,\r\nwill find itself placed providentially as an obstacle between the United\r\nStates and the countries of which it lately meditated the acquisition.\r\nThe United States will have the advantage of being unable even to think\r\nof Cuba, or Central America, or Mexico; they will be delivered for a\r\ntime from these baleful temptations, and from the States in which they\r\nmet the warmest support. And, during this time, the extreme South will\r\nbe forced, in some sort, to look at the problem of slavery under an\r\naspect before unknown to it.\r\n\r\nLater will come the shock, the postponed but inevitable conflict.\r\nBlockaded at the South, blockaded at the North, blockaded on the African\r\nside, undermined and torn by its intestine divisions, the extreme South\r\nwill have to face, at one time or another, the irresistible power of the\r\nUnited States. Does any one imagine by chance that the latter will\r\nforever relinquish New Orleans and the Gulf of Mexico? The more they\r\nbecome elevated and strengthened, the more they will be led, say rather,\r\nforced, to absorb again the portions of their former domain which have\r\nattempted to exist without them.\r\n\r\nFrom this time, the discussion relative to slavery will assume in the\r\nUnited States a simple and decided bearing. The extreme South, in\r\nquitting them, will have given them every facility; it will have endowed\r\nthem with political homogeneousness and liberal majorities. By the mere\r\neffect of the departure of the senators and representatives of the\r\nextreme South, the party opposed to slavery will have acquired, at the\r\noutset, the numerical majority which it lacked in Congress; it will be\r\nin a position to ensure the passage of its bills, to form its\r\nadministration, to constitute by degrees courts in every respect\r\nfavorable to its principles. Next, the border States who shall not have\r\nfollowed the fortunes of the extreme South will find themselves bound to\r\nthose of the North, associated with its interests, open to its ideas;\r\nand it is a fixed fact that several will not be long in completing the\r\nwork of liberty already begun among them, and thus becoming, with their\r\nrich and extensive Territories, of the number of those fortunate States\r\nin which the suppression of slavery gives the signal for the fruitful\r\ninvasion of immigrants, for agricultural progress, for wealth, and for\r\ncredit. In this manner the \"patriarchal institution\" will disappear\r\npeaceably from the intermediate region, while it will be threatened by\r\nmore terrible shocks in the tropical region.\r\n\r\nThis is a chance which is common to limited and to total secession, but\r\nwhich is still more unavoidable in the last. Face to face with the\r\nmiserable Confederacy of the extreme South, the United States can afford\r\nto be patient; face to face with the Confederacy comprising all the\r\nslave States, (or, which means the same, face to face with two distinct\r\nConfederacies, comprising, the one the cotton States, the other the\r\nborder States, yet united against the North through an old instinct of\r\ncomplicity,) the attitude of the United States, as every one foresees,\r\nwill inevitably be more hostile. Total secession itself can be born only\r\nfrom a sentiment of declared hostility; it amounts to a declaration of\r\nwar. Suppose that Mr. Lincoln rejects the advice of those of his cabinet\r\nwho would incline to accept the fact of separation; suppose that, while\r\ntreating the South with gentleness, and striving to spare it the horrors\r\nof an armed strife, he persists in protecting the rights of the\r\nConfederation, and securing to it, by a maritime blockade, the\r\ncollection of taxes; suppose that the blockade is organized from South\r\nCarolina to the Rio Grande, supported by Forts Pickens, Jefferson, and\r\nTaylor, which will have been revictualled at all costs after the forced\r\nevacuation of Fort Sumter; suppose that, in this manner, watch is kept\r\nover the ports of Charleston, Savannah, Mobile, and New Orleans, may it\r\nnot happen that the insurrectional government at Montgomery will decide\r\nto effect a march on Washington? Is it not probable that North Carolina,\r\nVirginia, and Maryland will allow themselves to be crossed without\r\nsaying a word? More than this, are we not justified in believing that\r\nthese States, and with them a considerable number of the central ones,\r\nrallied around their ancient banner by the very approach of peril, will\r\nmake common cause with the slave Confederacy? In such a case, how avert\r\nthe chances of a direful conflict? Will the United States carry patience\r\nwith respect to the aggressors, the fear of giving a signal of ruin,\r\ndeference to the counsels lavished on them perhaps, so far as to refuse\r\nto return a violent attack, and to consent to the ravishment of their\r\ncapital? It is hard to believe. If the South make the attack, the war\r\nwill break out, and the border States will be exposed to the first blow.\r\n\r\nBut admit that they succeed in preventing an immediate explosion, the\r\nmere fact of a total secession, and of the formation of two\r\nConfederacies, almost equal, (in appearance at least,) will permit no\r\none to count on the prolonged preservation of peace. What repulsion,\r\nwhat grievances will be found in all relations, in all questions! And\r\nfrom a grievance to war, from war to negro insurrections, what will be\r\nthe distance, I ask? The South will be then an immense powder magazine,\r\nto which the first spark will set fire. And the South will not lose its\r\nhabits of arrogance, it will be quarrelsome as always. Has it not\r\nalready announced in its journals that, on the first encouragement\r\ngiven to its fugitive slaves, it will draw the sword? Now, such\r\nencouragement certainly will not be wanting. The South does not know at\r\nthe present time how much the North, of which it complains, contributes\r\nto prevent the escapes which it fears. The Federal Government is at hand\r\nto oppose them, in some measure at least. When the preventive obstacle\r\nshall have disappeared, the South will see with what rapidity its\r\nslavery will glide away on every point of its frontier; it will see its\r\n_happy_ negroes ready to brave a thousand perils rather than remain\r\nunder its law. Alas! it will see many other proofs of their devotion to\r\nservitude. I do not like to bring bloody images, at which I shudder, too\r\noften before the eyes of the reader; it must be said, notwithstanding,\r\nwhile it is yet time, that the general Confederacy of the South,\r\nintoxicated with its projects, resolved to increase its possessions,\r\nforced to demand from the African slave trade the means of repeopling\r\nits States, depopulated by escape, and to install slavery into new\r\nterritories, will draw upon it, not only the wrath of the United States,\r\nbut the indignation of the entire world. And what misery, what ruin will\r\nensue from the first conflict!\r\n\r\nI like better to fix my thoughts on the third hypothesis--that of a\r\nreturn to the now broken Union. Taught by experience, recognizing how\r\nlittle weight it has in the world since its separation from the United\r\nStates, poor, weak, divided, comprehending the impossibility of\r\nrealizing its true plans without exposing itself to calamities, losing\r\nits resources, one after another, even to the cultivation of cotton,\r\nwhich also demands credit and security, incapable of preventing the\r\nflight of its slaves, and not daring to brave that great power of public\r\nopinion which will interdict it the African trade, the Southern\r\nConfederacy, exhausted and dismayed, will perhaps one day prefer\r\nreturning to the bosom of the Union, to plunging into the extremity of\r\nmisfortune. In this case, again, the question of affranchisement will\r\nhave made vast strides. The United States will have taken a decided\r\nposition in the absence of the South, which its return cannot destroy;\r\nconvictions will be fixed, the final impulse will have been given, and\r\nto this impulse, the South, come to repentance, will know that nothing\r\nis left it but to submit.\r\n\r\nFinally comes a last hypothesis, which I mention because it is necessary\r\nto foresee every possibility. Under the combined influence of the border\r\nStates and the States of the North, equally desirous of maintaining the\r\nUnion, the attempts of the extreme South will have failed, its secession\r\nwill have lasted only a few months, and a compromise will have served to\r\ncover its retreat. But what compromise could compensate for a fact so\r\nimportant as the election of Mr. Lincoln? It has a deep significance\r\nwhich no compromise will remove; it signifies that the conquests of\r\nslavery are ended. This proven, the future is easy to foresee:\r\nincreasing majorities in the North, increasing disproportion of the two\r\nparts of the Confederation. At the end of the four years of a Lincoln\r\nadministration, the slave States will have lost all hope of struggling,\r\nwith their eight thousand whites charged with keeping four millions of\r\nblacks, against the twenty millions of citizens that inhabit the free\r\nStates. Let us add that, the future once fixed and the question of\r\npreponderance once resolved, many passions will moderate by degrees. The\r\nnumber of free States will increase, not only by the settling of new\r\nterritories, but also by the affranchisement of the thinly scattered\r\nslaves, becoming continually more thinly scattered, of Maryland, of\r\nDelaware, or of Missouri. We can even now describe this affranchisement,\r\nso well is the _American method_ known. It consists, as every one knows,\r\nin emancipating the children that are to be born. This is the method\r\nwhich has been uniformly applied in the Northern States, and which will\r\nbe doubtless applied some day in the border States, provided, however,\r\ncivil war does not come to accomplish a very different emancipation\r\n--emancipation by the rising of the slaves. There will be nothing\r\nof this, I hope; pacific progress will have its way. We shall\r\nthen see these intermediate States, one after the other, regaining life\r\nin the same time as liberty: they will become transformed as if touched\r\nby the wand of a fairy.\r\n\r\nSuch are the future prospects which offer themselves to us. If we\r\nremember, besides, the movement which is beginning to be wrought in the\r\nreligious societies and the churches--a movement which cannot fail to be\r\nsoon complete, we shall know on what to rely concerning the fate which\r\nawaits a social iniquity against which are at once conspiring the\r\nfollies of its friends; and the indignation of its foes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nCOEXISTENCE OF THE TWO RACES AFTER EMANCIPATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomething more difficult to foresee than the suppression, henceforth\r\ncertain, of slavery, is the consequence of this suppression. The problem\r\nof the coexistence of the two races rests at the present hour with a\r\ncrushing weight on the thoughts of all; it mingles poignant doubts with\r\nthe hopes of some, it exasperates the resistance of others. Is it true\r\nthat emancipation would be the signal of a struggle for extermination?\r\nIs there not room upon American soil for free blacks by the side of free\r\nwhites? I do not conceal from myself that there is here an accredited\r\nprejudice, an admitted opinion which, perhaps more than any thing else,\r\ntrammels the progress of the United States. Let us attempt to estimate\r\nit.\r\n\r\nM. de Tocqueville, who has judged America with so sure an eye, has been,\r\nnotwithstanding, mistaken upon some points; his warmest admirers must\r\nadmit it. Writing at an epoch when the great results of English\r\nemancipation had not yet been produced, he was led to frame that\r\nformidable judgment of which so much advantage has been taken:\r\n\"Hitherto, wherever the whites have been the more powerful, they have\r\nheld the negroes in degradation and slavery; wherever the negroes have\r\nbeen the more powerful, they have destroyed the whites. This is the only\r\naccount which can ever be opened between the two races.\"\r\n\r\nAnother account is opened, thank God, and no one will rejoice at it more\r\nsincerely than M. de Tocqueville--he who is so generous, and whose\r\nabolition sentiments are certainly no mystery to any of his colleagues\r\nof the Chamber. But his opinion remains in his book, and every one\r\nrepeats after him, that the blacks and the whites cannot live together\r\non the same soil, unless the latter be subject to the former.\r\n\r\nI repeat, that at the time at which he wrote, he had reason, or at least\r\nknown facts gave him reason, to say this; the liberty of the blacks had\r\nthen but one name--St. Domingo. To-day, the victories of Christian\r\nemancipation have come, to contrast with the catastrophes provoked by\r\nimpenitent despotism.\r\n\r\nThe English Colonies bear a striking analogy to the Southern States of\r\nthe Union. The blacks there are numerous, more numerous even in\r\nproportion to the whites than in the Carolinas or Florida. The climate\r\nis even more scorching, and the cultures demand still more imperiously\r\nthe labor of the blacks. As to the prejudices of the masters, I dare\r\naffirm that the planters of the Continent and those of the Antilles have\r\nnot long had any thing with which to reproach each other.\r\nNotwithstanding, what has happened in the Antilles? Not only has liberty\r\nbeen proclaimed--this was the act of the metropolis--but the coexistence\r\nof races has subsisted. It is to this point that I claim attention.\r\nThey, the whites and the blacks, alike free, invested with the same\r\nprivileges, exercising the same rights, encountering each other in the\r\nranks of the militia, in the magistracy, and even in the seats of the\r\ncolonial assemblies, admirably accept this life in common. And the\r\nwhites there, observe, are Anglo-Saxons; that is, they belong to that\r\nrace which is declared incapable of enduring free blacks in its\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to appeal sometimes from those axioms so boldly laid\r\ndown, which serve us to make inflexible laws for that which must be\r\nsubject in an infinite measure to the mobility of circumstances and\r\ninfluences. The influence of the Gospel, especially, is a fact, the\r\nscope of which is never sufficiently measured. It has created in the\r\nAntilles a negro population which maintains its equality face to face\r\nwith the whites, yet which does not entirely reject their patronage; a\r\ndependent population which is also a free population, free in the most\r\nabsolute sense of the word. The blacks of the Antilles labor on the\r\nplantations, and secure the success of large plantations; but, at the\r\nsame time, they themselves become landholders, forming by degrees one of\r\nthe happiest and most remarkable classes of peasants that ever existed.\r\nTheir little fields, their pretty villages, manifest real prosperity;\r\nand there is something among them that is worth more than prosperity,\r\nthere is moral progress, the development of intellect, and the elevation\r\nof souls.\r\n\r\nIt will be demanded of us if, in the midst of so much progress, the\r\nproduction of sugar has not suffered. I answer that, on the contrary, it\r\nhas increased. It had been predicted that emancipation would be a\r\ndeath-blow to the British colonies. I suspect that many people are even\r\nyet persuaded of it; now, in spite of the faults committed by the\r\nplanters, who have neglected nothing to disgust the negroes with labor\r\nand to drive them from their old mills, they are found to return to\r\nthem, contenting themselves with wages that scarcely rise above an\r\naverage of a shilling a day. If we compare the two last censuses of\r\nliberty with the two last years of slavery, we shall discover that the\r\ntotal production of sugar has increased in the colonies in which\r\nemancipation was effected in 1834. And they have not only had to endure\r\nthis crisis of emancipation, but also another crisis still more\r\nformidable, that of the sudden introduction of free trade in 1834. The\r\ncolonial sugars, exposed to competition with the sugar produced at\r\nHavana and elsewhere by slave labor, experienced a prodigious decline.\r\nThere was cause to believe that the production was about to be\r\ndestroyed; it has risen again, notwithstanding, and the English\r\nAntilles, with their free negroes and their unprotected sugar, forced to\r\nface entire liberty in all its forms, import to-day into the metropolis\r\nnearly a million more hogsheads than at the moment when the crisis of\r\nfree trade broke forth.\r\n\r\nLiberty works miracles. We always distrust her, and she replies to our\r\nsuspicions by benefits. The English Antilles, which, during the last\r\nthirty years, have had to surmount, besides the two crises of\r\nemancipation and free trade, the earthquake of 1840 and six consecutive\r\nyears of drought; the English Antilles, which have had to liquidate\r\ntheir old debts, and to repair the ruin accruing from the failure of the\r\nbank of Jamaica, are now in an attitude which proves that they have no\r\nfears for the future and scarcely regret the past.\r\n\r\nUnder slavery, the Antilles were hastening to their ruin; with liberty,\r\nthey have become one of the richest channels of exportation which\r\nEngland possesses; under slavery, they could not have supported the\r\nshock of free trade; with liberty, they have gained this new battle:\r\nsuch are the net proceeds of experience. If we still have doubts, let us\r\ncompare Dutch Guiana, which holds slaves, to English Guiana, which has\r\nemancipated them. The resources of these two countries are almost equal;\r\nEnglish Guiana is progressing, while the cultures of Surinam are\r\nforsaken; three-fourths of its plantations are already abandoned, and\r\nthe rest will follow.\r\n\r\nBut the question of profits and losses is not the only one here, I\r\nthink, and after having computed the proceeds of sugar, after having\r\nshown that in this respect English emancipation is in rule, it is\r\nallowable to mention also another kind of result. Look at these pretty\r\ncottages, this neat and almost elegant furniture, these gardens, this\r\ngeneral air of comfort and civilization; question these blacks, whose\r\nphysical appearance has become modified already under the influence of\r\nliberty, these blacks, who decreased rapidly in numbers during the epoch\r\nof slavery, and who have begun to increase, on the contrary, since their\r\naffranchisement; they will tell us that they are happy. Some have become\r\nlandowners, and labor on their own account, (this is not a crime, I\r\nimagine;) others unite to strengthen large plantations, or perhaps to\r\ncarry to the works of rich planters the canes gathered by them on their\r\nown grounds; some are merchants, many hire themselves out as farmers.\r\nWhatever may be the faults of some individuals, the ensemble of free\r\nnegroes has merited the testimony rendered in 1857 by the Governor of\r\nTobago: \"I deny that our blacks of the country are of indolent habits.\r\nSo industrious a class of inhabitants does not exist in the world.\"\r\n\r\nAn admirable spectacle, and one which the history of mankind presents to\r\nus too rarely, is that of a degraded population elevating itself more\r\nand more, and placing itself on a level with those who before despised\r\nit. Concubinage, so general in times of servitude as to give rise to\r\nthe famous axiom, \"Negroes abhor marriage,\" is now replaced by regular\r\nunions. In becoming free, the negroes have learned to respect\r\nthemselves: the unanimous reports of the governors mark the progress of\r\ntheir habits of sobriety. Crimes have greatly diminished among them.\r\nThey are polite and well brought up, falling even into the excess of\r\nexaggerated courtesy. They respect the aged: if an old man passes\r\nthrough the streets, the children rise and cease their play.\r\n\r\nThese children are assiduously sent to schools, the support of which\r\ndepends, in a great part, upon the voluntary gifts of the negroes.\r\nGrateful to the Gospel which has set them free, the former slaves have\r\nbecome passionately attached to their pastors; their first resources are\r\nconsecrated to churches, to schools, and sometimes, also, to distant\r\nmissions, to the evangelization of that Africa which they remember to do\r\nit good. We should be at once surprised and humiliated, were we to\r\ncompare the much-vaunted gifts of our charity with those of these poor\r\npeople, these freed men of yesterday, whom we think that we may\r\nrightfully treat with disdain.\r\n\r\nThanks to the Gospel, and it is to this that I return, the problem of\r\nthe coexistence of races is resolved in the most pacific manner in the\r\nAntilles. Among freemen, however little these freemen may be\r\nChristianized, specific inequalities become speedily effaced, and the\r\nprejudice of skin is not found to be ultimately as insurmountable as we\r\nhave been told. In these English colonies, which are true republics,\r\ngoverning themselves, and which also remind us, through this feature, of\r\nthe Southern States, the blacks have come to be accepted as\r\nfellow-citizens. They practise the liberal professions; they are\r\nelectors and often elected, for they form of themselves alone one-fifth\r\nof the Colonial Assembly at Jamaica; they are officers of the police and\r\nthe militia, and their authority never fails to be recognized by all. I\r\nnamed Jamaica just now. Some may seek to bring it as an argument against\r\nme. The fact is, that this great island has seemed to form an exception\r\nto the general prosperity; considerable fortunes have been sunk there,\r\nand the transformation has been slower and more painful there than\r\nelsewhere. But, when they arm themselves with these circumstances, they\r\nforget two things: first, that the causes of the malady were anterior to\r\nemancipation; next, that the cure has come from emancipation itself.\r\nBefore emancipation, Jamaica was insolvent, her plantations were\r\nmortgaged beyond their value, and its planting was threatened in other\r\nways far more than now. Do you know what has since happened?\r\nDifficulties which appeared insoluble have been resolved; to-day, the\r\ncape is doubled, and men navigate in peace. At the present time, Jamaica\r\ncomprises two or three hundred villages, inhabited by free negroes; the\r\nlatter are willing to work; for, according to the latest information,\r\n(February, 1861,) the price of daily labor decreases instead of rising.\r\nAmong these free negroes, there are not less than ten thousand\r\nlandholders, and three-eighths of the cultivated soil is in their hands.\r\nThey have established sugar-mills everywhere, imperfect, rude, yet\r\nworking in a passable manner; and mills of this sort are numbered by\r\nthousands. The middle class of color thus grows richer day by day; the\r\nfamilies that compose it all own a horse or a mule; they have their\r\nbank-books and their accounts with the savings banks. Lastly, which is\r\nof more value than all else, the free negroes of Jamaica have built more\r\nthan two hundred chapels, and as many schools. At the very moment when I\r\nwrite these lines, an enthusiastic religious movement is prevailing\r\namong them; the rum-shops are abandoned, the most degraded classes\r\nenter in their turn the path of reformation.\r\n\r\nI should have been glad to cite our own colonies instead of confining\r\nmyself to the English islands. I have been prevented from this, not only\r\nby the memory of the conflagrations of 1859 at Martinique, and of the\r\nstate of siege which it became necessary to proclaim there, but, above\r\nall, by the circumstance that the liberty of our former slaves has been\r\ntoo often restrained by means of the vagabond regulations, that labor\r\nhas continued to be imposed on them to a certain point; that the\r\nparcelling out of property has been trammelled by fiscal measures; that,\r\nmoreover, it is less the labor of our former slaves than of the Coolies\r\nand others employed, which has secured the success of our experiment;\r\nwhence it follows that this success is far from being as conclusive as\r\nthat which has been obtained elsewhere under the system of full liberty.\r\nNevertheless, our success, which is no less real, signifies something\r\nalso. If we have not yet those little free villages, that class of small\r\nnegro landholders of which I just spoke, we have, like the English, free\r\nnegroes in our militia and in our marine; like them, we have had our\r\nelections, and all classes of the population have taken part in them;\r\nlike them, and perhaps in a greater degree, we have increased our sugar\r\nproduction since emancipation. It is true that the crisis of free trade\r\nhas not yet passed among us, and that we cannot know how this would be\r\nsupported by our colonial sugars. But it will not be long before we\r\nshall be informed on this point: by an act which we cannot but applaud,\r\nand which continues the work it has undertaken, the French government\r\nhas just suppressed the protection continued hitherto to our planters.\r\nIf, ere long, as it is justifiable to hope, they are delivered from the\r\ncharges of the colonial system, whose advantages they have lost, we\r\nshall see them struggle, and successfully, I am convinced, against the\r\nSpanish sugars produced by slave labor.\r\n\r\nIt will be, perhaps, maintained, that the antipathy of race is stronger\r\nin the United States than elsewhere, and that the Americans, in this\r\nrespect, are inferior to the English. I am as conscious as any one else\r\nof those infamous proceedings towards free negroes which are the crime\r\nof the North, a crime no less odious than that of the South. What\r\nconscience is not aroused at the thought of those prejudices of skin\r\nwhich do not permit blacks to sit by the side of whites, in schools,\r\nchurches, or public vehicles? Only the other day, nothing less than a\r\ndenunciation in open parliament was needed to begin the destruction, by\r\na public rebuke, of the classification which is being made on the\r\nEnglish steamers themselves between Liverpool and New York. There are\r\nsome new States which purely and simply exclude free negroes from their\r\nTerritory; those which do not exclude them from the Territory, repulse\r\nthem from the ballot-box. The injustice, in fine, is as gross, as\r\ncrying, as it is possible to imagine.\r\n\r\nMust we conclude from this that the coexistence of races, possible\r\nelsewhere, is impossible in the United States? I distrust those sweeping\r\nassertions which resolve problems at one stroke; I refuse, above all, to\r\nadmit so easily that iniquity must be maintained for the sole reason\r\nthat it exists, and that it suffices to say: \"I am thus made; what would\r\nyou have? I cannot change myself,\" to abstract one's self from the\r\naccomplishment of the most elementary duty. To endure negroes at one's\r\nside, to respect their independence, to abstain from wrongs towards\r\nthem, to consent to the full exercise of their rights, is an elementary\r\nduty; Christian duty, I need not say, demands something better.\r\n\r\nDoes this mean that we are to set ourselves up as judges, and brand as\r\nwretches all those who thus mistake the laws of charity and justice? I\r\nfear much that, in their place, we would do precisely as they. Living in\r\nthe South, we would have slaves, and would defend slavery to the last;\r\nliving in the North, we would tread under foot the free colored class.\r\nIs there then neither the true, nor the false, nor justice, nor\r\ninjustice? God forbid! The just and the true remain; iniquity should be\r\ncondemned without pity; but we are bound to be more indulgent towards\r\nmen than, towards things. We are bound to remember that the influence of\r\nsurroundings is enormous, and that, if crimes are always without excuse,\r\nthere are many excusable criminals. When we examine men by the prejudice\r\nof skin, such as prevails in the United States, we are not long in\r\ndiscovering that it rests in great part on a misunderstanding: men\r\nmistake coexistence for amalgamation. I do not fear to affirm that the\r\nsecond would be as undesirable as the first would be desirable. Why\r\ndream of blending or of assimilating the two races? Why pursue as an\r\nideal frequent marriages between them, and the formation of a third\r\nrace: that of mulattoes? America does right to resist such ideas, and to\r\ninscribe her testimony against such a future, evidently very little in\r\nconformity with the designs of God.\r\n\r\nBut coexistence by no means draws amalgamation in its train. On this\r\npoint, also, experience has spoken. In the English colonies, the liberty\r\nof the blacks is entire, the legal equality of the two races is not\r\ncontested, public manners have shaped themselves to that mutual\r\nconsideration without which they could not live together; yet neither\r\namalgamation nor assimilation is in question, and the aristocracy of\r\nskin remains what it should be, a lasting distinction, accepted on both\r\nsides, between races which are not designed to mingle together. I do not\r\nknow that many marriages are contracted between the whites and the\r\nnegresses of Jamaica, and I believe that the class of mulattoes\r\nincreases much more rapidly under slavery than with liberty. Look in\r\nthis respect at what takes place even now in the United States: as\r\nquadroons sell better than blacks, mixtures, of white or almost white\r\nslaves abound there, and the unhappy women who refuse to lend themselves\r\nto certain combinations are often whipped in punishment.\r\n\r\nWith liberty, each race can at least remain by itself; with it, there\r\ncan be coexistence without amalgamation; both mingling and hostility can\r\nbe prevented. This is the more easy, inasmuch as the negroes, with the\r\ngentleness of their race, willingly accept the second place, and by no\r\nmeans demand what we insist on refusing them. Let their liberty be\r\ncomplete, let legal equality and friendly relations be maintained, and\r\nthey will ask no more.\r\n\r\nBut they will ask no less, and they are right. I do not understand, in\r\ntruth, why so harmless a co-existence should be so long repulsed by the\r\nenlightened people of the United States. There are negroes in Spanish\r\nAmerica who have reached the highest grades of the army, and who show as\r\nmuch intelligence, decorum, and dignity in command as white men could\r\ndo. I myself have seen at Paris, a clergyman of ebony blackness, who was\r\nreally the most distinguished, unexceptionable man that it was possible\r\nto meet; he was a remarkable scholar, and had received the title of\r\ndoctor from several European universities.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the negroes are our fellows and our equals much more than we\r\nimagine; they adapt themselves better than the Indians to our\r\ncivilization. They seek to be instructed, and not only do the free\r\nblacks of the English islands hasten, as we have seen, to provide\r\nthemselves with teachers, but even those of the United States, crushed\r\nas they are by contemptuous treatment, neglect no means of introducing\r\ntheir children into the schools, where is found one-ninth of their\r\ntotal number. In Liberia, they have shown themselves hitherto very\r\ncapable of ruling. In Hayti, since their deliverance from the ridiculous\r\nand odious yoke of Soulouque, they have advanced rapidly, it is\r\naffirmed, in the way of true progress; legal marriages increase, popular\r\ninstruction is becoming established, religious liberty is respected.\r\nLastly, in the negro colony of Buxton, in Canada, the fugitive slaves\r\nhave become industrious landholders, and are respected by all.\r\n\r\nLet us not say that prejudice of skin is indestructible; the suppression\r\nof slavery may modify it profoundly. What degrades the free negro\r\nto-day, is the existence of the negro slave. To be respectable, we all\r\nneed to be respected. The poor, free negro is ashamed of himself; he\r\ndares not aspire to any thing noble and great; he preserves, besides, as\r\nthe legacy of slavery, the idea that labor is dishonoring, that idleness\r\nis a sign of independence. This is enough to make him remain a stranger\r\nto honorable occupations, and confine himself to the practice of vile\r\ntrades. When slavery shall have disappeared, the situation of the free\r\nblacks will become quite different: they will be numerous; they will\r\nhave an appreciable share in the regulation of national affairs; their\r\nvote will count, and, thenceforth, we may be tranquil, no one will be\r\nafraid to treat them with respect, and perhaps to pay court to them.\r\n\r\nThe law of New York, as well as the Supreme Court of that State, has\r\nalready admitted that color exercises no influence over the rights of\r\ncitizens. The time draws near when the North will no longer contest the\r\nintervention of free negroes at the ballot-box. This will be a great\r\nstep in advance. Let us remark, moreover, that, after general\r\nemancipation, the black population, while exercising its share of\r\ninfluence, will never be able, through the number of suffrages at its\r\ndisposal, to alarm the jealous susceptibility of the whites; the latter,\r\nin fact, will be continually recruited by European immigration, and the\r\nday will come when the few negroes of the United States will be scarcely\r\nperceptible in the heart of a gigantic nation.\r\n\r\nThe honor of the North is at stake; it belongs to it to give an example\r\nat this time, and to show, by the reform of its own habits, that it has\r\nthe right to combat the crime of the South. It must set to work\r\nseriously, resolutely, to resolve the problem of the coexistence of\r\nraces, while the South resolves, willing or unwilling, the problem of\r\nemancipation. Liberty in the South, equality in the North; the one is\r\nno less necessary than the other; it may even be said that one great\r\nobstacle to the idea of emancipation is this other idea that blacks and\r\nwhites cannot live together, but that one must some day exterminate the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nWhy suffer the establishment of this lying axiom which checks all\r\nprogress? Why not cast our eyes on the neighboring colonies where the\r\nprejudice of color reigned supremely before emancipation, and where it\r\nhas since become rapidly effaced. The United States have a lofty end to\r\nattain; let them beware how they take too low an aim! They will not have\r\nmore than they need, with the efforts of all, the charity of all, the\r\nsacrifices of all, the earnest endeavors by which all can elevate\r\nthemselves above vulgar prejudices, to accomplish a task at once the\r\nmost difficult and most glorious that has ever been proposed to a great\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe North, I repeat, is bound to give a noble example by obtaining a\r\nshining victory over itself. Let it say to itself that coexistence is\r\nnot amalgamation; the question is not to marry negroes, but to treat\r\nthem with justice. The fear of amalgamation once vanished, many things\r\nwill change in appearance. Why, in fact, is the prejudice of race\r\nstronger in the free States than in the slave States? Because the latter\r\nknow that slavery is a sufficient line of demarcation, and because they\r\nhave not to dread amalgamation. Now, this is and will be nowhere to be\r\ndreaded; the instinct of both races will prevent such mingling, and the\r\nblacks are as anxious to remain separate from the whites as the whites\r\nare to avoid alliance with the blacks. As I have said, nothing but\r\nslavery, and the perverse habits that it engenders, could have succeeded\r\nin some sort in breaking down this barrier. If the class of mullattoes\r\nthus formed rule in some republics of South America, it proceeds from\r\nthe absence of a numerous and powerful white race, like that which is\r\ncovering the United States with its continually increasing population.\r\n\r\nDecidedly, fears of amalgamation are puerile in such a country; and\r\ndecidedly also, any other solution than the coexistence of races would\r\nbe wrong. Doubtless, a natural concentration of the emancipated negroes\r\nwill be some day effected; they will flock to those States where their\r\nrelative number will ensure to them the most influence. Perhaps we may\r\neven obtain a glimpse of the time when, by the result of a providential\r\ncompensation, the countries which have been the witnesses of their\r\nsufferings, and which they have watered with their tears, these\r\ncountries where they, better than any others, can devote themselves to\r\nlabor, will belong to them in great part. Are the Antilles and the\r\nregions of the Gulf of Mexico destined to become the refuge and almost\r\nthe empire of Africans torn from their own continent? It is possible,\r\nbut not certain. In any case, this geographical repartition of the races\r\nwould be wrought peaceably; the effort to effect it by violent measures\r\nwould justly arouse the conscience of the human race. So long as we talk\r\nof transporting the blacks to Africa, to St. Domingo, or elsewhere, so\r\nlong as the peaceable coexistence of the races be not accepted, the\r\nbarbarous proceedings which dishonor America will not cease, the\r\nNorthern States will maltreat their free negroes, and the South will\r\ncling to slavery as to the only means of preventing a struggle for\r\nextermination.\r\n\r\nAt the North as well as the South, men need to accustom themselves in\r\nfine to the idea of coexistence. Yes, there will be whites and free\r\nblacks in various parts of the Union; yes, it is certain that in some\r\nparts, the black population will be possessed of influence; it may even\r\nhappen that, in one or two points of the extreme South, it will come to\r\nrule. If this hypothesis, improbable in my opinion, should ever be\r\nrealized, it would not be a cause of shame, but of glory, to the Union.\r\nIt is said that the great Indian tribes of the Southwest think of\r\nforming a State, which will demand admission into the Union, and which\r\nhas a chance to obtain it. Why should there not be, at need, a negro\r\nState by the side of an Indian State? This reparation would be fully due\r\nto the oppressed race, and America would be honored in treading her\r\nrepugnance under foot, and in showing to the whole world that her so\r\nmuch vaunted liberty is not a vain word.\r\n\r\nShe would show, at the same time, that her Christian faith is not a vain\r\nformality. If the desire of avoiding amalgamation has legitimate\r\ngrounds, the antipathy of race is simply abominable. Words cannot be\r\nfound severe enough to censure the conduct of those _Christians_ who,\r\npursuing with their indignation the slavery of the South, refuse to\r\nfulfil the simplest duties of kindness, or even of common equity,\r\ntowards the free negroes of the North.\r\n\r\nBut I hope that the Gospel, accustomed to work miracles, will also work\r\nthis. Let us be just; we have already seen the pious ladies of\r\nPhiladelphia lavishing their cares on black and white without\r\ndistinction at the time of the cholera invasion. They washed and\r\ndressed with their own hands, in the hospital which they had founded,\r\nthe children rendered orphans by the scourge, without taking account of\r\nthe differences of color. This is a sign of progress, and I could cite\r\nseveral others; I could name cities, Chicago, for instance, where the\r\nschools are opened by law to the blacks as well as the whites. There is\r\na power in the United States which will overthrow the obstacle of the\r\nNorth as well as that of the South, which will abolish both slavery and\r\nprejudice of skin.\r\n\r\nThis power has shown in the Antilles what it can do. There, pastors and\r\nmissionaries, schools, works of charity pursued in common, have placed\r\non a level the blacks and the whites, devoted to the same cause, and\r\nransomed by the same Saviour. In the United States; likewise, the\r\nChristian faith will raise up the one, and will teach the others to\r\nhumble themselves; it will destroy the vices of the negro, and will\r\nbreak the detestable pride of the Anglo-Saxon. The real influence of\r\nfaith on both--this is the true solution, this is the true bond of the\r\nraces. Through this, will be established relations of mutual love and\r\nrespect. What a mission is reserved for the churches of the United\r\nStates! Checked hitherto by enormous difficulties, which it would be\r\nunjust not to take into account, they have not acted the part in the\r\nrecent struggle against slavery which reverted to them of right. They\r\nhave done a great deal, whatever may be said; they are disposed to do\r\nstill more, and their attitude has improved visibly within a year. But\r\nthis cannot suffice; there are two problems to resolve instead of one;\r\nthe question is now, to approach both face to face. True equality is\r\nfounded, under the eye of God, through the community of hopes and of\r\nrepentance, through close association in worship, in prayer, in action;\r\nand this equality has nothing in common with the jealous spirit of\r\nlevelling which suffers old grievances to subsist, and continually\r\ninvents new; it is peaceable, forgetful of evil, confiding, truly\r\nfraternal. I do not dream, of course, of the universal conversion of the\r\npopulation of the United States, both black and white; I know only that\r\nthe Gospel, though it deeply penetrates comparatively few hearts,\r\nextends its influence much further, and acts on those that it has not\r\nwon. Let the Christians of America set to work, let them reject, for it\r\nis time, the scandals still presented here and there by their apologists\r\nfor slavery, let them forbear to spare that which is culpable, to call\r\ngood evil, or evil good, and they will render to their country a\r\nservice which they alone can render it, and to which nothing on earth\r\ncan be compared.\r\n\r\nThe United States do not know how great will be the transformation of\r\ntheir internal condition, and the increase of their good renown abroad,\r\nwhen their churches, their schools, their public vehicles, their\r\nballot-boxes, shall be widely accessible to persons of color, when\r\nequality and liberty shall have become realities on their soil; they do\r\nnot know how great will be their peace and their prosperity. Let the two\r\ninseparable problems of slavery and the coexistence of races be resolved\r\namong them under the ruling influence of the Gospel, and they will\r\nwitness the birth of a future far better than the past. No more fears,\r\nno more rivalries, no more separations in perspective, their conquests\r\nwill become accomplished of themselves; and, no longer destined to swell\r\nthe domain of servitude, they will win the applause of the entire world.\r\n\r\nAnd all this will not be purchased, as men seem to believe, by the\r\nsacrifice of the cotton culture. At the present time, this culture\r\nincurs but one serious risk: the momentary triumph of a party that\r\ndreams of a slavery propaganda; it will be saved alone by the progress\r\nof liberty. On the day when emancipation shall be achieved, if wrought\r\nby the action of moral agents and social necessities, instead of by that\r\nof civil wars and insurrections, the cultivation of cotton in the\r\nSouthern States will receive the impetus to a magnificent development.\r\nThe emancipated negroes make large quantities of sugar in the Antilles;\r\nwhy should they not make cotton on firm ground? If affranchisement\r\nproduced the destruction of planting in St. Domingo, we know now the\r\nreason. It is a proved fact that negroes who do not owe their liberty to\r\ninsurrection, remain disposed to devote themselves to labor in the\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nWith slavery, observe, disappear, one after the other, the obstacles in\r\nthe way of agricultural progress. The capital which no one dares risk\r\nto-day in the Southern States, will flow into them emulously as soon as\r\nslavery shall be abolished; I say more: as soon as its progressive\r\nabolition shall be no longer doubtful in the sight of all. European\r\nimmigration, the current of which turns aside with so much\r\ncircumspection, avoiding a territory accursed and given over to\r\ncalamities, will flock towards those countries more beautiful, more\r\nfertile, and broader than those of the Far West. Machinery will come, to\r\nmore than fill up the void caused by the passing diminution of the\r\nnumber of laborers. The slaves can be intrusted with none but the\r\nsimplest implements: every one knows that the plough, introduced\r\noriginally into our French colonies, disappeared to make room for the\r\nhoe as soon as Colbert had authorized the slave trade. Ploughs have\r\nreappeared there since emancipation. Their agricultural and industrial\r\nprogress date from the same epoch: to-day, our colonists understand the\r\nuse of manures, and make improvements in manufacture. A new era is\r\ndawning, in fine; what will it be in the United States, among that\r\npeople which seems destined to surpass all others in the application of\r\nmechanics to agriculture?\r\n\r\nStill, I have made one concession too much in admitting the diminution\r\nof the number of laborers. Supposing that a few negroes quit the field,\r\nmany whites will come to take their place. White labor is fully possible\r\nin the majority of the slave States, and immigrants from Europe will not\r\nhesitate to engage in it. Wherever slavery reigns, it is that, and not\r\nthe climate, that must be arraigned if the whites fold their hands;\r\nlabor has become there a servile act--it is blighted, as it were, in its\r\nessence. A competent writer said the other day: \"If Algeria had been\r\nsubjected to the sway of slavery, cultivation there would have been\r\nreputed impracticable for the French, and examples of mortality would\r\nnot have been wanting.\" The whites have labored in the Antilles; the\r\nwhites can labor, not only in all the slave States of the intermediate\r\nregion, but in Louisiana. Cotton is already produced in Texas, thanks to\r\nits German settlers. The question is only, to go on in this way. Slavery\r\nonce abolished, the small proprietors, who at present carry all the\r\ncriminal extravagancies of the South further than any others, will be\r\ncompelled to set their hands to work. This will be an advantage both to\r\nthe country and themselves. Who will not pray for the coming of the time\r\nwhen so considerable a part of the population will cease to possess\r\nslaves which it is incapable of feeding, when it will be transformed\r\ninto the middle class, and thus escape the real servitude which\r\nembitters it?\r\n\r\nMoreover, let us not forget new cultures, that of the vine among others,\r\nwhich are fitted to become introduced into these new countries, or to\r\ndevelop there, and which lack nothing but liberty in order to flourish.\r\nThe arts and manufactures also have their place; independently of the\r\ntillers of the soil, properly called, the Southern States will have need\r\nof workmen in manufactories, and of managers of agricultural machines;\r\nlarge plantations will often, become divided, as has happened in the\r\nAntilles, and we shall witness the appearance of the small estate, that\r\nessential basis of social order. There will be employment for all, and\r\nthe rich Southern cultures will be less neglected than before.\r\n\r\nWhoever has descended the Ohio has involuntarily compared its two banks:\r\nhere, the State of Ohio, whose prosperity advances with rapid strides;\r\nthere, the State of Kentucky, no less favored by Nature, yet which\r\nlanguishes as if abandoned. Why? Because slavery blights all that it\r\ntouches. Could not the whites of Kentucky and Virginia labor as well as\r\nthose of Ohio? The comparative poverty of these slave States reminds me\r\nof the destitution of our colonies and those of England before\r\nemancipation: mortgaged estates, plantations burdened with expenses, the\r\ncomplete destruction of credit--such was their position. We must read\r\nAmerican statistics to form an idea of the truly unheard-of extent of\r\nthis fact--impoverishment by slavery. With a larger extent and much\r\nricher lands, the slave States possess neither agricultural growth, nor\r\nindustrial growth, nor advance of population, which can be compared far\r\nor near with that which is found in the free States. A book by Mr.\r\nHinton Rowan Helper, _The Impending Crisis of the South_, expresses\r\nthese differences in figures so significant that it is impossible to\r\ncontest them.\r\n\r\nThe Southern States, therefore, are certain to increase their cultures,\r\nand to found their lasting prosperity by entering the path that leads to\r\nemancipation. But if they take the contrary road, they will hasten to\r\ntheir destruction, and with strange rapidity. Already, their violent\r\nacts of secession, and the monstrous plans which are necessarily\r\nattached to them, have had the first effect, easily foreseen, of dealing\r\na most dangerous blow to American cotton. In a few weeks, they have done\r\nthemselves more harm than the North, supposing its hostility as great as\r\nit is little, could have done them in twenty years. The meeting of\r\nManchester has replied to the manifestoes of Charleston; England has\r\nsaid to herself, that, from men so determined to destroy themselves, she\r\nshould count on nothing; and, having taken her resolution, she will\r\nproceed with it speedily; let the Southern States take care. English\r\nIndia can produce as much cotton as America; before long, if the\r\nCarolinians persist, they will have obtained the glorious result of\r\ndespoiling their country of its chief resource; they will have killed\r\nthe hen that laid the golden eggs. The matter is serious; I ask them to\r\nreflect on it. As England, under pain of falling into want and riots,\r\ncannot dispense with cotton for a single day, she will act\r\nenergetically. Cotton grows marvellously in many countries; in the\r\nAntilles, where it has been produced already; in Algeria, where the\r\nplantations are about to be increased; on the whole continent of Africa,\r\nin fine, where it enters perhaps into the plans of God thus to make a\r\nbreach in indigenous slavery by the faults committed by slaveholders in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESENT CRISIS WILL REGENERATE THE INSTITUTIONS\r\nOF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt remains for me to inquire what influence the present crisis may exert\r\non the institutions of the United States. It is at the expense of these\r\ninstitutions that the slave States, inferior in strength, in numbers, in\r\nprogress of every kind, would reëstablish their fatal and growing\r\npreponderance. Here again, therefore, my thesis subsists: the victories\r\nof the South had compromised every thing, the resistance of the North is\r\nabout to save every thing; the election of Mr. Lincoln is a painful but\r\nsalutary crisis, it is the first effort of a great people rising.\r\n\r\nThe party of slavery had introduced into the heart of American\r\ndemocracy, a permanent cause of debasement and corruption. In this\r\nrespect, also, it was leading the Confederation to its death by the most\r\ndirect and speedy way. I wish to show how it developed the worst sides\r\nof the democratic system. I hope to be impartial towards this system;\r\nalthough persuaded that the government of which England offers us the\r\nmodel is better suited to guaranty public liberties and to second true\r\nprogress in every thing, I am not of those who place the shadow before\r\nthe substance, and who condemn democracy without appeal. Are we destined\r\nsome day to pass into its hands? Have we already begun to glide down the\r\ndescent that leads to it? It is possible. In any case, it would be\r\nunjust to hate America on account of it, as is too often done. America\r\nhas had no choice; in virtue of its origin and its history, it could be\r\nnothing else than a democracy. If it has the faults of democracy, the\r\nunamiable rudeness, the violent proceedings, the levelling passions, I\r\nam scarcely surprised at it. I ask myself rather if it has known how to\r\nfind a basis of support against the temptations of such a system, if it\r\nhas prevented the subjugation of individuals by the mass, the absorption\r\nof consciences by the State, the substitution of the sovereignty of the\r\nend for that of the people. These are the shoals of democracy; have they\r\nbeen shunned by the United States? Have they been able to avoid\r\ntransforming it either into tyranny or socialism? We shall see that, if\r\nit has not succumbed to the temptation, this has not been the fault of\r\nthe party of slavery. Thanks to it, the corruption of democratic\r\ninstitutions was rapidly advancing; a single adversary, constantly the\r\nsame, has combated the progress of this work of destruction. We shall\r\nencounter again, upon the ground of political institutions, the\r\nfundamental antagonism of the Gospel and slavery.\r\n\r\nI say first, that it is rarely that names are altogether fortuitous, and\r\ndo not correspond to things. It has often given rise to astonishment\r\nthat the party of slavery should have taken the name of the democratic\r\nparty; notwithstanding, nothing was more natural. How could slavery have\r\nbeen defended if not by exaggerating democracy? It was necessary, in\r\nsuch a cause, to deny the notions of right, of truth, and of justice; it\r\nwas necessary that the greater number should become right, truth, and\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nSomething more even was needed. The _sovereignty of the end_ must yield,\r\nif necessary, before the sovereignty of numbers. A cause like that of\r\nslavery is only defended in the heart of a democratic nation, by\r\nteaching it contempt of scruples, and the stifling of the conscience.\r\nEvery thing is allowable, every thing is good, provided that we succeed\r\nin our ends! This is the rule which it designs shall prevail in\r\npolitical contests. A single question, seeing nothing but itself,\r\ndetermined to spare nothing, offering itself to parties, whoever they\r\nmay be, who seek a change, creating factitious majorities to effect the\r\nends of base ambition, taking account neither of honor nor country, and\r\nattaining its end through every thing--this is enough to vitiate\r\nprofoundly institutions and morals. The sovereignty of the idea, when it\r\nhas laid hands on the sovereignty of the people, is in a position to go\r\nto great lengths, and to sink very low. Moral maxims and written laws\r\nare trodden under foot, a struggle without pity or remorse begins, a\r\nstruggle of life and death. Social passions easily acquire a degree of\r\nperversity which political passions do not possess; the former are\r\nwithout conscience and without compassion; they will be satisfied, cost\r\nwhat it may; triumph is in their eyes an absolute, an inexorable\r\nnecessity. Rather than not conquer, they will rend the country.\r\n\r\nWhat the regular working of institutions becomes under such a pressure,\r\nevery one can divine. For some years past, in proportion as the\r\npretensions of the slavery party had increased, we had seen public\r\nmorals become tainted in the United States. Indifference to means had\r\nmade alarming progress, and had been felt even in the habits of\r\ncommerce, and the relations of private life. The spirit of enterprise\r\nhad come to be exalted even in its most dishonorable acts; respect for\r\nbankrupts seemed almost to be propagated. It is a fact, that men like\r\nMr. Jefferson Davis, the present President of the revolted South, were\r\nnot afraid to recommend the repudiation of debts. In the school of\r\nslavery, a disembarrassed and unscrupulous manner of acting had given\r\nits stamp to the general manner of the nation. Affairs were going on\r\nrapidly, the liberties of America were on the high road to ruin; it was\r\ntime that the reaction of liberal and honorable sentiments should make\r\nitself felt. The election of 1860 marked the stopping-place.\r\n\r\nI wonder that they could have stopped; such a fact demands an\r\nexplanation, for ordinarily the declivities of democratic decline are\r\nnever remounted. The natural tendency there being to deny the right of\r\nthe minority, (the most precious of all,) to sink the man entire in the\r\nballot, to lay violent hands on the private portion of his life, and to\r\nforce even his conscience into the social contract, it follows that\r\ngovernments arise in which the question of limitation becomes effaced by\r\nthe question of origin. In the face of such a power, nothing is left\r\nstanding; no more rights, no more principles, no more of those solid and\r\nresisting blocks which serve to stem the popular current; the province\r\nof the State becomes indefinite.\r\n\r\nAnd how much more irresistible and more perverse is this tendency, when\r\na profound cause of corruption, such as slavery, adds its action to the\r\nstrength of such democracies! It is no longer, in such cases, the\r\nsovereign majority alone before which the right may be forced to bow, it\r\nis a party determined to attain its ends, which penetrates with violence\r\ninto that domain of conscience where human laws should not enter; a\r\nparty which sets about regulating sometimes the belief, sometimes the\r\nthought, sometimes the speech. Such has been the influence exercised in\r\nthe United States by the institution of slavery; it has forbidden\r\nauthors to write, clergymen to preach, and almost individuals to think\r\nany thing that displeased it; it has invented the right of secession, in\r\norder to have at its disposal a formidable means of intimidation, and to\r\nplace a threat behind each of its demands. To yield, to descend, to\r\ndescend still further, to obey a continued impulse of democratic\r\ndebasement, such is the course to which it has impelled the whole\r\nConfederation.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, the United States have resisted. I shall tell why; I\r\nshall show by virtue of what marvellous force Americans have escaped the\r\nabsolute levelling which seemed destined to be produced by a complicated\r\ndemocracy of slavery. But I wish first to finish depicting the natural\r\neffects of such a system.\r\n\r\nSuppose for a moment a nation (and such are not wanting) modelled after\r\nthe antique. The Pagan principle reigns there supremely, the State\r\nabsorbs every thing, souls are banded together and governed; a\r\ncentralized power, a visible Providence, is substituted for individual\r\naction; creeds have essentially the hereditary and national form; each\r\none believes what the rest believe, each one does what the rest do, each\r\none holds the opinions which are found in the ancient traditions of the\r\ncountry; truth is no longer a personal conviction, acquired at the price\r\nof earnest struggles, and worth much because it has cost much; it\r\ndescends to the rank of customs to which it is fitting to conform, it\r\nhas its marked place among social obligations, and forms part of the\r\nduties of the citizen.\r\n\r\nLet democracy come to establish its empire in the heart of such a\r\nnation, and you will see with what rapidity every thing will disappear\r\nthat bears the slightest resemblance to individual independence. The\r\nmore effectual the levelling, the greater will seem the community; and\r\nthe smaller the individual, the more, too, in face of the privileges of\r\nthe whole, will the very idea of personal rights become effaced. The\r\nmajority is held infallible, and the minority appears criminal if it\r\ntakes the liberty of refusing to subject its thoughts (yes, its very\r\nthoughts) to that of the majority. In this innumerable host of like\r\nbeings, no one is authorized to possess any thing in private; of all\r\naristocracies, that of the conscience appears then least endurable. Men\r\nbelieve in the majority, in the mass, in the nation. We have no idea of\r\nthe intellectual despotism of a democracy which fails to encounter on\r\nits road the obstacle of personal convictions; it disposes of the human\r\nsoul, it creates an unlimited confidence in the judgment of public\r\nopinion, it heads a school of popular courtiers, and teaches each one\r\nthe art of setting his watch by the clock of the market-place.\r\n\r\nIntelligence, conscience, convictions--all bend, and what does not bend\r\nis broken. This happens, above all, we repeat without wearying, when a\r\ndetestable cause like that of slavery perverts the working of democratic\r\ninstitutions. Then, the tyranny of the majorities has no bounds; the\r\nmajorities themselves are formed by means of ignoble contracts and\r\nmonstrous alliances. In the midst of lower passions let loose, through\r\nbanded parties, imperative mandates, and factitious organizations, which\r\nno longer leave the smallest outlet for the flight of the least\r\nindependent wish, the perversities of corrupt and misled democracy have\r\nfull scope.\r\n\r\nIn writing these pages, have I described American democracy? Yes and no.\r\nYes, for such are really the temptations to which America has been\r\nexposed, such are really the vices with which it might have often been\r\nreproached; no, for a principle of resistance has always revealed itself\r\nin the darkest moments, an irrepressible something has always remained.\r\nIn vain the heavy roller has passed and repassed over the ground; it has\r\nalways encountered blocks of granite that would not be broken. This is\r\nthe point which I had at heart to signal out in closing this study,\r\nknowing that it forms its most essential part, and that whoever has not\r\ngiven it his attention cannot comprehend the United States. The\r\nextraordinary fact, much more extraordinary than is supposed, that,\r\nunder the system of democracy ruled by slavery, men have been able to\r\npause and retrace their steps, is only explained by the peculiar form\r\nwhich religious belief has put on in the United States. We have not\r\nbefore our eyes a Latin nation, a nation clad in the vestments of Greece\r\nor Rome, a nation having, according to the ancient mode, its religion\r\nand its usages universally but indolently admitted. This republic of the\r\nNew World is by no means one of those slave republics of ancient times,\r\nin which the citizens took delight in conversing on public affairs, but\r\nin which no one had the bad taste to question his conscience with\r\nrespect to the public creeds. The pagan life, with its obligatory\r\nworship, its common education, its suppression of the family and the\r\nindividual in behalf of the State, its existence transported to the\r\nForum; the pagan life, in which the citizen absorbs the individual, and\r\nin which the calm and serene uniformity of indifferent centuries ends,\r\nby giving to each one the national physiognomy, bears no resemblance to\r\nthe moral and social life of the United States.\r\n\r\nAmong them, not the smallest trace is found of that system which seeks\r\nto make nations, and which forgets to make men. They were born, as we\r\nmay say, of a protestation of the human conscience. A noble origin,\r\nwhich explains many things! It is, in fact, the revindication of\r\nreligious independence against religious uniformity, and the established\r\nchurch which created it two hundred years ago. Of course, I have not to\r\nexamine here the intrinsic value of the Puritan doctrines. I content\r\nmyself with affirming that they landed in America in the name of\r\nliberty, that they were destined to establish liberty there, that they\r\nwere destined to build there the true rampart against democratic\r\ntyranny.\r\n\r\nFrom the first day, the State was deprived of the direction of the\r\nintellectual and moral man. Despite that inevitable mixture of\r\ninconsistencies and hesitation which marks our first efforts in all\r\nthings, the Puritan colonies, destined one day to become the United\r\nStates, set out on the road which led to liberty of belief, of thoughts,\r\nof speech, of the press, of assemblage, of instruction. The most\r\nconsiderable, most important rights were abstracted at the outset from\r\nthe domain of democratic deliberations; insuperable bounds were set to\r\nthe sovereignty of numbers; the right of minorities, that of the\r\nindividual, the right of remaining alone against all others, the right\r\nof being of one's own opinion, was reserved. Furthermore, they did not\r\ndelay to break the bonds between the Church and the State entirely, in\r\nsuch a manner as to deprive the official superintendence of belief of\r\nits last pretext. Self-government was founded, that is, the most formal\r\nnegation of subjugation by the democracy. While the latter tends to the\r\nmaximum of government, the American Government tends to the minimum of\r\ngovernment, that form _par excellence_ of liberalism. And it does not\r\ntend thither, as in the Middle Ages, by anarchy, by the absence of\r\nnational ties, and moreover by despoiling the individual of his rights\r\nof conscience and thought, confiscated then more entirely for the\r\nbenefit of a sovereign church than they have been since for the benefit\r\nof the State; no, American individualism proceeds differently: if it\r\nrestrains with salutary vigor the province of governments, it is to\r\nenlarge that of the human soul.\r\n\r\nThis is a great conquest; the whole future of the modern world is\r\ncontained in it. Destined as we are to submit, in a measure at least, to\r\nthe action of democracy, the question whether we shall he slaves or free\r\nmen is resolved in this: shall we, after the example of America, have\r\nour reserved tribunal, our closed domain in which the public power shall\r\nbe permitted to see nothing? Shall there be things among us (the most\r\nimportant of all) which shall not be put to the vote? Shall our\r\ndemocracy have its boundaries, and beyond these boundaries shall a vast\r\ncountry be seen to extend--that of free belief, of free worship, of free\r\nthought, of the free home?\r\n\r\nIt is because American democracy has boundaries that its worst excesses\r\nhave finally found chastisement. It is not installed alone in the United\r\nStates; opposite it, another power which knows no fear, is occupied with\r\nresisting it. The entire history of America is explained by this double\r\nfact: the falling and the rising again, the servitudes and the\r\nliberties, the too long triumph of the slavery party, and the recent\r\nvictory of Mr. Lincoln, the deadly peril so lately incurred, and the\r\nnoble future that opens to-day.\r\n\r\nIndividualism is not isolation, individual convictions are not sectarian\r\nconvictions; they found on the contrary the most powerful of the\r\nunities, moral unity. The thing which most actively dissolves societies\r\nwhile seeming to unite them, is the uniformity of national dogmas which,\r\naccepted as an inheritance, remain without action over the heart. What\r\nare, in fact, the great bonds on earth, if not duty and affection? Now,\r\nnothing but personal convictions, earnestly acquired by the sweat of our\r\nbrow, can destroy selfishness in us. Without this strong cement of\r\nconvictions at once individual and common, you will build nothing that\r\nwill endure. The United States have in their heart strong convictions,\r\nwhich are also common convictions; through external diversities, we\r\nhave seen that fundamental conformity is real, and all earnest appeal to\r\nChristian truths agitates this country, so divided in appearance, from\r\none end to the other. National life is here a reality. I do not think\r\nthat Socialism, which excuses us from believing ourselves, which places\r\nour soul under responsible administration, and preserves us, it is said,\r\nfrom the baleful disruptions engendered by individualism, succeeds as\r\nwell in destroying selfishness and in diffusing ideas of devotion and\r\nduty. When democracy becomes socialistic, (and it never has been able to\r\nbecome so in the United States,) it grinds down and reduces souls to\r\nsuch a degree that nothing is left but a fine dust, a sort of\r\nintellectual and moral powder which, it is true, is an obstacle to\r\nnothing, but which creates nothing either. To build an edifice, stones\r\nare needed, sand will not suffice.\r\n\r\nChristian individualism makes the stones, and the democratic party has\r\njust perceived it. In a country where independence of soul has\r\nacclimated independence in all its forms, men may indeed bow the head\r\nsometimes to democracy allied to slavery; but this debasement has a\r\nlimit, and the time is coming when they will raise their heads. Strong\r\nbeliefs are a strong rampart, the slaves of truth are free men, and\r\ntrue independence begins in the heart. To have convictions in order to\r\nhave characters, to have believers in order to have citizens, to have\r\nenergetic minds in order to have powerful nations, to have resistance in\r\norder to have support--such is the programme of individualism. Show me\r\na country where men are proud enough not to bow before the majority,\r\nwhere they do not think themselves lost when they depart from, the\r\nbeaten track, and jostle of received opinions; and I will admit that\r\nthere it will be possible to practise democracy without falling into\r\nservitude.\r\n\r\nThere is but one country of individual belief, that could attempt the\r\nalliance, hitherto deemed impossible, of democracy and liberty. The\r\ntheory in accordance with which the public liberties of England have the\r\naristocracy for their essential basis, is admitted as an axiom; without\r\ncontemning this element of social organization, it is advisable to mine\r\ndeeper than this to discover the true foundation of liberty. Individual\r\nbelief--this is the foundation. The more we reflect, the more we\r\ndiscover that the essential thing is not the forms of government, or\r\neven the relations of the different classes, but the moral state of the\r\ncommunity. Are men there? Have souls become masters of themselves? Are\r\ncharacters formed? Has the force of resistance appeared? Whoever shall\r\nhave replied to these questions will have decided, knowingly or\r\nunknowingly, whether liberty be possible.\r\n\r\nI do not know that any people should be excluded from liberty; only all\r\nare bound to pursue it by the path that leads to it, by earnestness of\r\nconvictions, by internal affranchisement, which signifies by the Gospel.\r\nWe may seek in vain, we shall find no means comparable to this (I speak\r\nin the political point of view) when the question is to make citizens.\r\nTo place one's self under the absolute authority of God and his word, is\r\nto acquire in the face of mere parties, majorities, general opinions, an\r\nindependence that nothing can supply. The independence within is always\r\ntranslated without; he who is independent of men, in the domain of\r\nbeliefs and of thoughts, will be equally so in the domain of public\r\naffairs. Thus democracy itself will not degenerate into socialism. No\r\none has been able to point out the slightest symptom of socialism in the\r\nUnited States. Notwithstanding, democracy is fully complete there, and\r\nthe election of Mr. Lincoln, once drover, once flatboatman, once\r\nrail-splitter, once clerk--of Mr. Lincoln, the son of his works, who has\r\nsucceeded by his own powers in becoming a well-informed man and an\r\norator, this election proves certainly that American equality is not\r\nmenaced by the success of the republican party. It menaces only the evil\r\ndemocracy, which, under the guidance of the slavery party, sought to\r\nforce the nation into the path of socialism. But it will not succeed in\r\nthis; the question has just been decided. Between these two systems,\r\nwhich are to contend for contemporaneous communities, between socialism\r\nand individualism, the choice of the United States is made.\r\n\r\nBefore witnessing the affranchisement of the slaves, we shall,\r\ntherefore, witness the affranchisement of American politics. They have\r\nendured a shameful yoke, and received sad lessons. Since Jefferson, the\r\nborn enemy of true liberalism, founded the Democratic party, the United\r\nStates had continued to descend the declivity of radicalism; a work of\r\nrelentless levelling was thenceforth pursued, and the domain of the\r\nconscience became gradually invaded. The democratic party found its\r\nfulcrum in the South. The slave States forced the enclosure of the\r\nprivate tribunal, and confiscated in behalf of the State the inviolable\r\nrights of the individual: neither thought, the press, nor the pulpit,\r\nwere free among them; the fundamental maxims of Puritan tradition were\r\nsacrificed by them one after the other. They did more: thanks to them,\r\nmen were beginning to learn in the free States how to set to work to\r\npervert their own consciences, and to substitute for it respect for\r\nsovereign majorities. Every day, crying iniquities were covered by the\r\npretext: \"If we were just, we should compromise the national unity, or\r\nwe should risk losing the votes secured to our party.\" Violence, menace,\r\nbrutality, and corruption, were boldly introduced into political\r\nstruggles. Men became habituated to evil: the most odious crimes, the\r\nSouthern laws reducing to legal slavery every free negro who should not\r\nquit the soil of the States, hardly raised a murmur of disapprobation;\r\nthe United States seemed on the point of losing that faculty which\r\nnothing can survive--the faculty of indignation.\r\n\r\nBehold in what school the democratic party had placed the American\r\npeople--that noble people which, despite the grave faults with which it\r\nmay be reproached, represents in the main many of the lofty principles\r\nwhich are allied to the future of modern communities. The reign of the\r\nDemocratic party would form the subject of an inglorious history; in it\r\nwe should see figure the glorification of servitude, piracy applied to\r\ninternational right, and, in conclusion, those facts of corruption and\r\nwaste which served to crown its last Presidency. The most consistent\r\nchampions of the doctrines and practices of the democratic party, are\r\nthose men who have just declared that votes are valid only on condition\r\nof giving the majority to slavery, and that a regular election is a\r\nsufficient cause for separation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have not sought to recount events, but to attempt a study, which I\r\nbelieve to be useful to us, and which may, also, not be useless to the\r\nUnited States. We owe them the support of our sympathy. It is more\r\nimportant than people imagine to let them hear words of encouragement\r\nfrom us at this decisive moment. Let us not hasten to declare that the\r\nUnion is destroyed, that, henceforth and forever, there will be two\r\nConfederacies existing on the same footing, that the United States of\r\nslavery will have their great _rôle_ to perform here below, like the\r\nUnited States of liberty. This would be, in any case, immense\r\nexaggeration. Let us not forget that the Union has often before seemed\r\nlost, that the Confederation has often before seemed ready to perish.\r\nAre the men who are terrified at the present perils, ignorant of those\r\nwhich surrounded the cradle of the United States: mutinous troops,\r\ncontending ambitions, threats of separation, anarchy, ruin? This\r\nAmerica, then so weak, is the same that has since become so strong, in\r\nspite of its own faults. At the moment when it rebelled against England,\r\nit had neither arts and manufactures, nor commerce, nor marine; and its\r\ntwo or three millions of inhabitants were far from agreeing among\r\nthemselves. Yet such is the vigor of its genius, such is its\r\ncarelessness of every kind of danger, such is the impetuosity with which\r\nit affronts and surmounts obstacles, such is the power of its national\r\nmotto; \"Go ahead!\" that through internal struggles, crises, and\r\nmomentary exhaustion, it has attained the stature of a great people.\r\nCount the steamboats on its rivers, estimate the tonnage of its vessels,\r\ncompute the amount of its internal trade, measure the length of its\r\ncanals and railroads, and you will still have but a faint idea of what\r\nit is capable of undertaking and accomplishing.\r\n\r\nWe must remember these things, and not imitate those enemies of America\r\nwho sometimes feign to put on mourning for her, sometimes jest at her\r\ndistress, and find in the present situation of the _disunited States_\r\n(for thus they style them) an agreeable subject for pleasantry,\r\nforgetting that this disunion has a serious cause, which is certainly of\r\nimportance enough to make itself understood; forgetting, too, that\r\ngenerous struggles for humanity and the country are worthy to obtain our\r\nfullest respect. And let us beware how we say that this crisis does not\r\nconcern us--that we can do nothing in it. The selfish isolation of\r\nnations is henceforth impossible. The question to be decided here\r\ninvolves our own affairs, not only because a portion of our fortune is\r\npledged to the United States, but, above all, because our principles and\r\nour liberties are concerned. The victories of justice, wherever they may\r\nbe won, are the victories of the human race.\r\n\r\nWe can aid this one in some measure. America, which affects sometimes to\r\ndeclare itself indifferent to our opinions, gathers them up, however,\r\nwith jealous care. I have seen respectable Americans blush at\r\nencountering that instinctive blame which, among us, is addressed to the\r\nprogress of slavery; they suffered at seeing their country thus fallen\r\nfrom the esteem which it formerly enjoyed. Proud nations like America\r\nalways avenge themselves by noble impulses for the reprobation which\r\nthey are conscious of having deserved. The moral intervention of Europe\r\nis not, therefore, superfluous; it is the less so, in that the South\r\ninsults us by counting on us. The ringleaders of Charleston and New\r\nOrleans affect to say that England is ready to open her arms to them,\r\nand that France promises a sympathizing reception to her envoys! These\r\nenvoys themselves have been selected with care, honorable, having\r\nfriends among us,--capable, in a word, of presenting the cause of\r\nslavery in an almost seductive light. It is important, therefore, that\r\nwe should not keep silence.\r\n\r\nLet governments be reserved; let them avoid every thing that would\r\nresemble direct action in the internal affairs of the United States, let\r\nthem have recourse to the commonplaces of speech employed by diplomacy\r\nto escape pledging their policy--this is well. But to imagine that these\r\ncommonplaces promise alliance or protection, is to be credulous indeed!\r\nA rebellion under cover of the flag of slavery, be sure, will find it\r\ndifficult to make partisans among us French, whatever may be our\r\nindolent indifference in other respects in this matter, an indifference\r\nso great that at the present time the American question _does not exist_\r\nto the most of us. Moreover, we shall shake off this inertia; and, as to\r\nthe English, they will not suffer their brightest title to glory in\r\nmodern times to be tarnished by any latent complicity with the Gulf\r\nStates. The brutal doctrines of interest, so often professed publicly in\r\nParliament by Mr. Bright, may indeed find organs; and Great Britain\r\nwill be counselled to remember cotton and forget justice. The measure\r\nalready taken by her at Washington, and which appears to have been\r\nsupported by France, a measure designed to declare that the blockade of\r\nthe Southern ports must be effectual to be recognized, is perhaps a\r\nconcession wrested from her by this detestable school of selfishness.\r\nHappily, there is another school face to face with this; the Christian\r\nsentiment, the sentiment of abolition, will arise and enforce obedience.\r\nNever was a more important work in store for it. To unveil every\r\nsuspicious act of the British Government, to keep public opinion\r\naroused, to maintain, in fine, that noble moral agitation which makes\r\nthe success of good causes and the safety of free nations, such is the\r\nmission proffered in England to the defenders of humanity and the\r\nGospel. If they could forget it, the populace of Mobile or Savannah\r\npursuing English consuls, would remind them to what principle the name\r\nof Great Britain is inevitably pledged, for the sake of its honor.\r\nFrance and England, I am confident, will act in unison, here as\r\nelsewhere; their alliance which comprises within itself the germs of all\r\ntrue progress, will be found as useful and as fruitful in the New World\r\nas it has proved in the Old.\r\n\r\nThis is of such importance that I beg leave to dwell on it; evidently\r\nour influence has not yet been exercised as it should have been, and if\r\nMr. Lincoln now bends somewhat before counsels devoid of energy and\r\ndignity, it proceeds in part from our reserve, our silence, our apparent\r\nneutrality--who knows? even from the discouraging language that has\r\nbeen sometimes held in our name. The publication of the unlucky Morrill\r\nTariff, (signed, we may say in passing, by Mr. Buchanan, and the\r\nrevocation of which, I am convinced, will be signed some day by Mr.\r\nLincoln,) has given the signal for political demonstrations, all of\r\nwhich are very far from being to the credit of Europe. Our _Moniteur_\r\nhas published articles to be regretted, but it is above all among the\r\nEnglish that the cotton party has had full scope.\r\n\r\nLet England beware! it were better for her to lose Malta, Corfu, and\r\nGibraltar, than the glorious position which her struggle against slavery\r\nand the slave trade has secured her in the esteem of nations. Even in\r\nour age of armed frigates and rifled cannon, the chief of all powers,\r\nthank God! is moral power. Woe to the nation that disregards it, and\r\nconsents to immolate its principles to its interests! From the beginning\r\nof the present conflict, the enemies of England, and they are numerous,\r\nhave predicted that the cause of cotton will weigh heavier in her scales\r\nthan the cause of justice and liberty. They are preparing to judge her\r\nby her conduct in the American crisis. Once more, let her beware!\r\n\r\nAnd under what pretexts do we chaffer with the government of Mr. Lincoln\r\nfor those energetic, persevering sympathies on which it has a right to\r\ncount? Let us examine.\r\n\r\nWe hear, in the first place, of the vigor of the South and the weakness\r\nof the North. It is not the first time that a bad cause has shown itself\r\nmore ardent, more daring, less preoccupied by consequences, than a good\r\none. Good causes have scruples, and every scruple is an obstacle.\r\n\r\nI am assuredly as sorry as any one to see Mr. Lincoln struck with a sort\r\nof paralysis. To my mind, the dangers of inactivity are considerable; I\r\nbelieve that it discourages friends and encourages adversaries; I\r\nbelieve that it sanctions more or less the baleful and erroneous\r\nprinciple of secession, a principle more contagious than any other; I\r\nbelieve, in fine, that, by postponing civil war, it probably risks\r\nincreasing its gravity. Nevertheless, shall we not take into account the\r\nexceptional difficulties with which Mr. Lincoln is surrounded?\r\n\r\nThe preceding Administration took care to leave no resource in his\r\nhands: he found the forts either surrendered or indefensible, the\r\narsenals invaded, the army scattered, the navy despatched to distant\r\nparts of the seas. Is it strange that he should have yielded in some\r\ndegree to the entreaties of so many able men, all urging in the same\r\ndirection? If to-morrow he should yield entirely, if he should recognize\r\nthe Southern Confederacy, would it be great cause for astonishment?\r\n\r\nLet us not forget, moreover, that the border States are at hand, forming\r\na rampart, as it were, to protect the extreme South. Several of these\r\nStates, I am convinced, incline sincerely towards the North, and will\r\nremain united with it; but are there not others, Virginia, for instance,\r\nwhich perhaps only refrain from seceding for the better protection of\r\nthose that have done so, and whose present rôle consists in preventing\r\nall repression, while its future rôle will be to trammel all progress by\r\nthe continued threat of joining the Southern Confederacy?\r\n\r\nThese are serious obstacles; yet I have not pointed out the most serious\r\nof all--the intense and sincere repugnance which many Northern people,\r\nthough declared adversaries of slavery, experience towards measures\r\nthat are calculated to provoke slave insurrections, and endanger the\r\nsafety of the planters. I must acknowledge that the patience of the\r\nstrong seems here rather more laudable than the so much vaunted audacity\r\nof the weak, who count on this patience, and know that they can be\r\narrogant without much risk.\r\n\r\nThe second pretext that is audaciously brought forward to solicit our\r\ngood will towards the South, is that it has just ameliorated the Federal\r\ninstitutions. Let us ask in what consists this pretended amelioration?\r\nThe South has not feared to write in set terms, in its fundamental law,\r\nwhat none before it ever dared write, _the constitutional guarantee of\r\nslavery_. Slavery, in accordance with the Constitution of the South, can\r\nneither be suppressed nor assailed. Slavery will be the holy ark to be\r\nregarded with respect from afar off, the corner-stone which all are\r\nforbidden to touch. By the side of this, the South ostentatiously\r\nproclaims freedom of speech, of the press, of discussion in every form!\r\nMen shall be free to speak, but on condition of not touching, nearly or\r\nremotely, on any subject connected with slavery, (and every thing is\r\nconnected with it in the South.) They shall be free to print, but on\r\ncondition of giving no writing whatever to the public from which may be\r\ninferred the unity of mankind, the sanctity of family ties, the great\r\nprinciples, in fact, which the \"patriarchal system\" throws overboard.\r\nThey shall be free to discuss, but on condition of not disturbing this\r\ninstitution, impatient by nature, and still more so in future, now that\r\nit feels itself hemmed in and threatened on all sides. It will be by\r\nitself alone the whole Constitution of the South; this one article will\r\ndevour the rest; in default of legislatures and courts, the Southern\r\npopulace know how to give force to the guarantee of slavery, and to\r\nrestrain freedom of speech, of the press, and of discussion.\r\n\r\nIt is true that adroit patrons of the South Carolinian rebellion have a\r\nthird argument at their service which is no less specious. \"All is\r\nover,\" they exclaim, \"there is nobody now to sustain, there are no\r\nsympathies now to testify; in four days, peace will be made, the new\r\nConfederation will be recognized by Lincoln in person, a commercial\r\ntreaty will even ally it to the United States: the affair is ended.\"\r\n\r\nThe affair is scarcely begun, we answer; one must be blind not to see\r\nit. What is ended, is only the first skirmish. As to the war, it will be\r\nas long, believe me, as the life of the two principles which are\r\nstruggling in America. Let Mr. Lincoln assure himself, and let the\r\nEuropean adversaries of slavery remember as well, that it will be\r\nnecessary to combat and to persevere. Never was a more obstinate and\r\nmore colossal strife commenced on earth. Many of the border States will\r\nnot be long in raising pretensions to which they will join threats of\r\nnew secessions; they will again bring up the question of the\r\nTerritories, and will propose compromises. Who knows? they will aspire\r\nperhaps to establish, in the interests of the extreme South, the\r\nextradition of slaves escaped from the rival Confederacy. Who knows\r\nagain? they will perhaps attempt to restore their domestic slave trade\r\nwith Charleston and New Orleans.\r\n\r\nThis is not all. The time will come when the extreme South, incapable of\r\nenduring the life that it has just created for itself, will demand to\r\nreturn to the bosom of the Union. It will then insist on dictating its\r\nconditions; it will propose the election of a general convention charged\r\nwith reconstructing the Constitution of the United States; it will\r\nappeal to the selfishness of some, and to the ambition or even the\r\npatriotism of others, presenting to their sight the re-establishment of\r\nthe common greatness which separation had compromised. What a motive to\r\nveil principles for a moment! what a temptation to return to the fatal\r\npath so lately forsaken!\r\n\r\nI know very well that it will be henceforth impossible to return to it\r\ncompletely; nevertheless, the vigilance of Mr. Lincoln will not cease to\r\nbe necessary, and what will be no less necessary, is the moral support\r\nwhich we are bound to lend him in the hour of success and in the hour of\r\ndiscouragement, in good and in bad reputation. Where do we find a more\r\nglorious cause than this? despite the impure alloy which is mingled with\r\nit, of course, as with all glorious causes, is it not fitted to stir up\r\ngenerous hearts? Already, thanks to the defeat of the democratic party,\r\nthe United States that we once knew, those of the last ten years, those\r\nthat the South governed with its wand, those whose institutions were\r\ncorrupted and debased by slavery, those who numbered in the North as in\r\nthe South so many fortunes based openly on the slave traffic, those who\r\nhad seen among their Presidents a slave merchant, carrying on his\r\nspeculations in public view--these United States have just ended their\r\ncareer, they have entered the domain of history, their disappearance has\r\nbeen verified by the retreat of the extreme South.\r\n\r\nThe American people are now striving to rise. Enterprise as difficult\r\nas glorious! Whatever may be the issue of the first conflict, it will be\r\nonly the first conflict. There will be many others; the uprising of a\r\ngreat people is not the work of a day. Sometimes at peace, sometimes\r\nperhaps at war with the States that take in hand the cause of slavery,\r\nthe American Confederation will witness the development, one after\r\nanother, of the consequences necessarily produced by that decisive\r\nevent, the election of Mr. Lincoln. Having broken with the past, it will\r\nbe forced to enter further and further into the path of the future. We\r\nhave already seen that, whichever hypothesis is realized of those which\r\nwe are permitted to foresee, the cause of slavery is destined to\r\nexperience defeat after defeat. It has ceased to grow, it is about to\r\ndecrease, to decrease by separation, to decrease by union, to decrease\r\nby peace, to decrease by war. As surely as there will be obstacles\r\nwithout number to surmount in order to accomplish this work, so surely\r\nwill this work be accomplished. Certainly, it deserves to be loved and\r\nsustained, without discouragement and hesitation. Europe will comprehend\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOn seeing her attitude, the angry champions of slavery will doubtless\r\nperceive that they are mistaken, and that it is time to make new\r\ncalculations. As for the brave men of the North, they will he glad to\r\nlearn what is thought of them on this side of the Atlantic. This may\r\naid, and greatly, in the more or less distant re-establishment of the\r\nUnion. If the Gulf States knew what insurmountable disgust will be\r\naroused here by their Confederacy, founded to secure the duration and\r\nprosperity of slavery; if the border States knew what sympathies they\r\nwill gain by siding with liberty, and what maledictions they will incur\r\nby declaring themselves for slavery; if the Northern States knew what\r\nsupport is secured to them by that power, the chief of all others,\r\npublic opinion, we are justified in believing that the present crisis\r\nwould come to a prompt and peaceful solution.\r\n\r\nIt is a fixed fact that the nineteenth century will see the end of\r\nslavery in all its forms; and woe to him who opposes the march of such a\r\nprogress! Who is not deeply impressed by the thought that, on the 4th of\r\nMarch, at the very hour when Mr. Lincoln, in taking possession of the\r\nPresidency at Washington, signified to the attentive world the will of a\r\ngreat republic, determined to arrest the conquests of slavery, the\r\ngenerous head of a great empire signified to his ministers his\r\nimmutable resolve to prepare for the emancipation of the serfs. In such\r\ncoincidences, who does not recognize the finger of God. I am, therefore,\r\ntranquil: Russian opposition has failed, American opposition will fail.\r\nThere will be American opposition; there will be, there is such already,\r\nin the very surroundings and cabinet of the President. We have just seen\r\nhow it seeks to enervate his resolutions, to pledge him irrevocably to\r\nthat wavering policy, more to be dreaded for him than the projects of\r\nassassination about which, right or wrong, so much noise has been made.\r\nNevertheless, this evil has its bounds marked out in advance; he whom\r\nGod guards is well guarded. If you wish to know what the Presidency of\r\nMr. Lincoln will be in the end, see in what manner and under what\r\nauspices it was inaugurated; listen to the words that fell from the lips\r\nof the new President as he quitted his native town: \"The task that\r\ndevolves upon me is greater, perhaps, than that which has devolved on\r\nany other man since the days of Washington. I hope that you, my friends,\r\nwill all pray that I may receive that assistance from on high, without\r\nwhich I cannot succeed, but with which success is certain.\" \"Yes, yes;\r\nwe will pray for you!\" Such was the response of the inhabitants of\r\nSpringfield, who, weeping, and with uncovered heads, witnessed the\r\ndeparture of their fellow-citizen. What a _debut_ for a government! Have\r\nthere been many inaugurations here below of such thrilling solemnity? Do\r\nuniforms and plumes, the roar of cannon, triumphal arches, and vague\r\nappeals to Providence, equal these simple words: \"Pray for me!\" \"We will\r\npray for you\"! Ah! courage, Lincoln! the friends of freedom and of\r\nAmerica are with you. Courage! you hold in your hands the destinies of a\r\ngreat principle and a great people. Courage! You have to resist your\r\nfriends and to face your foes; it is the fate of all who seek to do good\r\non earth. Courage! You will have need of it to-morrow, in a year, to the\r\nend; you will have need of it in peace and in war; you will have need of\r\nit to avert the compromise in peace or war of that noble progress which\r\nit is your charge to accomplish, more than in conquests of slavery.\r\nCourage! your rôle, as you have said, may be inferior to no other, not\r\neven to that of Washington: to raise up the United States will not be\r\nless glorious than to have founded them.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtless from a distance that we express these sympathies, but\r\nthere are things which are judged better from a distance than near at\r\nhand. Europe is well situated to estimate the present crisis. The\r\nopinion of France, especially, should have some weight with the United\r\nStates: independently of our old alliances, we are, of all nations,\r\nperhaps, the most interested in the success of the Confederation. They\r\nare friendly voices which, here and elsewhere, in our reviews and our\r\njournals, bear to it the cordial expression of our wishes. In wishing\r\nthe final triumph of the North, we wish the salvation of the North and\r\nSouth, their common greatness and their lasting prosperity.\r\n\r\nBut the South disquiets us; we cannot disguise it. It is in bad hands. A\r\nsort of terror reigns there; important but moderate men are forced to\r\nbow the head, or to feel that it will be necessary to do so ere long.\r\nThe planters must see already that, in seeking to put away what they\r\ncall the yoke of the North, they are preparing for themselves other\r\nmasters. Business is suspended, money for cultivation is lacking, credit\r\nis everywhere refused, the ensuing harvest is mortgaged, the loans which\r\nit is sought to issue find no takers outside the extreme South. The\r\nresources of revolution remain, and they will be used unsparingly.\r\n\r\nWhat a position! Under the Constitution voted scarcely a month ago, we\r\nalready hear the deep rumbling of the quarrels of classes, of the\r\nplanters and the poor whites, of the aristocracy and the numerical\r\nmajority, of the prudent adversaries of the slave trade and its\r\nheadstrong partisans, of the statesmen who are tolerated for appearances\r\nand those who count on replacing them, of the present and the future.\r\n\r\nPeople will some day see clearly, even in Charleston. The separation\r\nwhich was to establish the prosperity of the South by permitting it at\r\nlast to live to its liking, to obey its genius, and to serve its\r\ninterests, has hitherto resulted in little, save the singing of the\r\n_Marseillaise, (the Marseillaise of Slavery!)_ and the striking down of\r\nthe Federal colors before the flag of the pelican and the rattlesnake. A\r\ngreat many blue ribbons and Colt's revolvers are sold; and busts of\r\nCalhoun, the first theorist of secession, axe carried about\r\nostentatiously. Next, to present a good mien to the eyes of Europe, a\r\nConstitution is voted in haste, a government is formed, an army is\r\ndecreed; but the revolutionary basis is remaining, and we perceive but\r\ntoo quickly how great disorder prevails in minds and things.\r\n\r\nAt the present hour, the democracy of the South is about to degenerate\r\ninto demagogism and dictatorship. But the North presents quite a\r\ndifferent spectacle. Mark what is passing there; pierce beneath\r\nappearances, beneath inevitable mistakes, beneath the no less inevitable\r\nwavering of a _debut_ so well prepared for by the preceding\r\nAdministration, and you will find the firm resolution of a people\r\nuprising. Who speaks of the end of the United States? This end seemed\r\napproaching but lately, in the hour of prosperity; then, honor was\r\ncompromised, esteem for the country was lowered, institutions were\r\nbecoming corrupted apace; the moment seemed approaching when the\r\nConfederation, tainted by slavery, could not but perish with it. Now,\r\nevery thing has changed aspect; the friends of America should take\r\nconfidence, for its greatness is inseparable, thank God! from the cause\r\nof justice.\r\n\r\n_Justice cannot do wrong_; I like to recall this maxim when I consider\r\nthe present state of America. In escaping a sudden and shameful death,\r\nit will not, assuredly, escape struggles and difficulties; in returning\r\nto life, it will encounter battle and danger longer than it imagines;\r\nlife is composed of this. To live is a laborious vocation, and nations\r\nwho wish to keep their place here below, who wish to act and not to\r\nsleep, must know that they will have their share of suffering. Perhaps\r\nit enters into the plans of God that the United States should endure for\r\na time some diminution of their greatness; let them be sure,\r\nnotwithstanding, that their flag will be neither less respected nor less\r\nglorious, if it shall thus lose a few of its stars. Those which it loses\r\nwill reappear on it some day, and how many others, meanwhile, will come\r\nto increase the Federal Constellation! With what acclamations will\r\nEurope salute the future progress of the United States, as soon as their\r\nprogress shall have ceased to be that of slavery!\r\n\r\nAt present, the point in question is to liquidate a bad debt. The moment\r\nof liquidation is always painful; but when it is over, credit revives.\r\nSo will it be in America. She has often boasted of the energetic\r\nsang-froid of her merchants; when ruined, they neither lament, nor are\r\ndiscouraged; there is a fortune to make again. In the same manner,\r\nputting things at the worst, supposing the present crisis to be\r\ncomparable to ruin; there is a nation to make again, it will be re-made.\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Mr. Seward lately, in concluding his great speech in\r\nCongress, \"if this Union were shattered to-day by the spirit of faction,\r\nit would reconstruct itself to-morrow with the former majestic\r\nproportions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA WORD OF PEACE\r\n\r\nON THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ENGLAND AND\r\nTHE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nBY COUNT AGÉNOR DE GASPARIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA WORD OF PEACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween the meetings of Liverpool and the ovations of New York, is there\r\nnot room for a word of peace? A word of peace, I know well, must be a\r\nword of impartiality. The speaker must resign himself to be treated as\r\nan American in England, and as an Englishman in America; but what does\r\nthis matter if truth make its way, and if an obstacle the more be raised\r\nin the way of this horrible war, this war contrary to nature, which\r\nwould begin by ensuring the triumph of the champions of negro slavery,\r\nand would end by exposing the cause of free institutions to more than\r\none perilous hazard?\r\n\r\nThere is one fundamental rule to follow in questions arising out of the\r\nright of search: to distrust first impressions. These, are always very\r\nvivid. An insult to the honor of the flag is always in question.\r\nPatriotic sensibilities, which I comprehend and which I respect, are\r\nalways brought into play. It is impossible that these officers, these\r\nstranger sailors, who have given commands and exacted obedience, who\r\nhave stopped the ship on its way, who have set foot on the sacred deck\r\nwhere floats the banner of the country, who have interrogated, who have\r\nsearched, who have had recourse, perhaps, to graver measures--it is\r\nimpossible that they should not have called forth many sentiments of\r\nanger and indignation. Even when practised with the most rigid\r\nformalities, even when confined within the limits of the strictest\r\nlegality, the right of search cannot fail to produce a feeling of\r\nannoyance. The recent search of the _Jules et Marie_, the yards of which\r\nwere carried away and the barricadings driven in, seems to me the\r\nfaithful type of all visits of search on the high seas--every one of\r\nthem brings damages in its train.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, the right of search is disputed by no one, and will be\r\nexercised in time of war, until the moment when the American\r\nproposition, reproduced again the other day by General Scott, shall be\r\nwelcomed by our Old World.\r\n\r\nI have just written the name of General Scott, and I did so with a\r\nfeeling of pleasure. Whoever has read his letter, must have said to\r\nhimself with me, that there exists in the United States a class of\r\nintelligent and moderate men--patriots, who have given proof of their\r\ncapacity and are capable of examining dispassionately the demands of the\r\nEnglish Government. These men know how much the maintenance of friendly\r\nrelations with England is worth in the present position of America.\r\nWhatever opinion they may form on the question of right growing out of\r\nthe action of Captain Wilkes, they comprehend that no consideration can\r\nweigh in the balance against the danger of bringing about the\r\nrecognition of the Southern Confederacy, the breaking of the blockade,\r\nwar, in short, with a powerful and friendly nation, a sister nation,\r\nsprung from the same blood, speaking the same language, devoted to the\r\nsame mission of civilization and liberty. No honorable sacrifice would\r\ncost them too dear in order to avert this fearful catastrophe.\r\n\r\nWould that they could see with their own eyes, were it but for a moment,\r\nwhat is passing to-day in Europe! Their enemies triumph, and their\r\nfriends are struck with consternation. We, who have always loved\r\nAmerica, and who love her better now that she is suffering for a noble\r\ncause; we who have defended her, we who have never ceased to believe in\r\nher final success, despite mistakes and repulses, feel all our hopes\r\nthreatened at once; the ground seems sinking beneath our feet. No, we\r\ncannot suppose that America, in recklessness of heart, will destroy with\r\nher own hands the fruit of so many efforts and sacrifices. This would\r\nnot be patriotism, it would not be dignity, it would be an act of\r\nmadness and suicide.\r\n\r\nIf the _Trent_ has violated the rules of neutrality, it remains none the\r\nless certain that other rules have been violated by the _San Jacinto_.\r\nThe duty of naval officers is limited to visiting ships and stopping\r\nthem, if need be, to carry them before a prize court. They cannot\r\nexercise the office of judge. In substituting the arrest of individuals\r\nfor the seizure of ships, and a military act for a judicial decree,\r\nCaptain Wilkes has given ground for the well-founded protests of\r\nEngland, at the same time that he has left the way open, thank God! for\r\nmeasures of reparation to be adopted by the United States.\r\n\r\nI know very well that there would have been no less indignation at\r\nLiverpool and London in case that the _Trent_ had been stopped on her\r\nway and carried before American courts. Perhaps, indeed, the regular and\r\ncorrect procedure would have been more deeply wounding than that of\r\nwhich England complains. We may be permitted to doubt with General\r\nScott that \"the injury would have been less, had it been greater.\" But\r\nthis is not the practical question, the only one that now concerns us.\r\nThe point is to get out of embarrassment; and the error committed by the\r\ncommander of the _San Jacinto_ furnishes a reasonable ground for\r\nconsenting to the liberation of the prisoners.\r\n\r\nFar from being a humiliation to the Government at Washington, this act\r\nof wisdom would be one of its brightest titles to glory. It would prove\r\nthat it is not wanting in moral power, that men calumniate it in\r\nrepresenting it as the slave of a bad democracy, incapable of resisting\r\nthe clamor of the streets, and of accepting, for the safety of the\r\ncountry, an hour of unpopularity.\r\n\r\nLet it believe us, its true friends, that in arresting Messrs. Mason and\r\nSlidell, it has done more for the cause of the South than Generals\r\nBeauregard or Price would have done by winning two great victories on\r\nthe Potomac and in Missouri. Messrs. Mason and Slidell are a hundred\r\ntimes more dangerous under the bolts of Fort Warren than in the streets\r\nof Paris or London; what their diplomacy would not certainly have\r\nobtained for them in many months, Captain Wilkes has procured for them\r\nin an hour. See what rejoicing is taking place in the camps of the\r\nSouthern partisans! They were beginning to despair; recognition, that\r\nonly chance of the defenders of slavery, seemed farther off than ever;\r\nthe recent successes of the Federal army announced the commencement of a\r\ngreat change in affairs. The war was carried from the suburbs of\r\nWashington to the heart of South Carolina itself; the only resources of\r\nconsequence remaining, were those that might spring up during the winter\r\nfrom the discontent of our industrial centres. Yet behold, suddenly, the\r\nstate of affairs transformed; recognition becomes possible, the blockade\r\nis threatened, the United States are in danger of being forced to turn\r\nfrom the South to face a more redoubtable foe!\r\n\r\nReally, what has Mr. Jefferson Davis done for you, that you should\r\nrender him such a service!\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to England, and tell her also the truth.\r\n\r\nSo long as England shall not treat the affair of the _Trent_ on its own\r\nmerits and with coolness, so long as she shall give ear to those\r\nfalsehoods invented by passion, which envenom questions of this sort,\r\nand exclude conciliatory measures and pacific hopes, she will labor\r\nactively to destroy all that she has gloriously built upon earth. It is\r\nimpossible to imagine the consequences, fatal to every form of liberty,\r\nwhich such a policy would comprise within itself.\r\n\r\nIt was at first supposed that Captain Wilkes had acted by virtue of\r\ninstructions, and that Mr. Lincoln's Government had expressly ordered\r\nhim to seize the Southern Commissioners on board the English vessel. Now\r\nit is found that Captain Wilkes, returning from Africa, had no\r\ninstructions of any sort. He acted, to use his expression, \"at his own\r\nrisk and peril\" like a true Yankee.\r\n\r\nIt was next supposed that Mr. Lincoln's Government had conceived the\r\ningenious project (such things are gravely printed and find men to\r\nbelieve them!) of seeking of itself a rupture with England. It was in\r\nneed of new enemies! It hoped, by this means, to rally to itself its\r\npresent adversaries! It was about to give over combating them, and to\r\nseek compensation through the conquest of Canada! I have followed the\r\nprogress of events in America as attentively as any one, I have read the\r\nAmerican newspapers, I have received letters, I have studied documents,\r\namong others the famous circular of Mr. Seward; I have seen there more\r\nthan one sign of discontent with the un-sympathizing attitude of\r\nEngland; I have also seen there the symptoms of the somewhat natural\r\nfear which the intervention of Europe in Mexico excites in men attached\r\nto the Monroe doctrine; but as to these incredible plans, I have never\r\ndiscovered the slightest trace of them. I add, that a marked return\r\ntowards friendly relations with England will be manifested the moment\r\nthat the latter shows herself more amicable towards America.\r\n\r\nIf there is any quality for which credit cannot be refused to the\r\nGovernment of Mr. Lincoln, it is precisely that of moderation and good\r\nsense. He has not taken very high ground--he has abstained, far too\r\nmuch, in my opinion, from laying down those principles, from uttering\r\nthose words which create sympathies, and make the conscience of the\r\nhuman race vibrate in unison. Say that he is a little prosaic, a little\r\nof the earth, earthy; do not say that he blusters, and that the best\r\nthing that England can do is to attack him without waiting to be first\r\nattacked.\r\n\r\nIn order to support, right or wrong, a fable which has found but too\r\nready belief, another story was invented: the Government of Mr. Lincoln\r\nwas at the end of its strength; despairing henceforth of conquering the\r\nSouth, it wished at any price to procure a diversion. Those who hold\r\nsuch language have doubtless never heard either of the Beaufort\r\nexpedition, or of the evacuation of Missouri by the Confederate troops,\r\nor of the victory recently gained in Kentucky. They do not know that the\r\nUnited States have accomplished the prodigy of putting half a million of\r\nmen under arms, that acts of insubordination have nearly ceased, that\r\nvolunteers for three years have everywhere replaced the three months'\r\nvolunteers. They do not know that the finances of the country are\r\nprosperous, and that Mr. Chase, the Secretary of the Treasury, has just\r\nnegotiated, under favorable conditions, the last part of his loan. I\r\nrecommend them to read the last letters of Mr. Russell, the\r\ncorrespondent of the _Times_; they will see there what an impartial\r\nwitness thought lately of the respective chances of the North and South.\r\n\r\nYes, before the intervention of the _San Jacinto_,--that involuntary\r\nally of the South, to whom the inhabitants of Charleston themselves\r\nought to vote swords of honor--before the _San Jacinto_, the situation\r\nof the United States presented the most favorable aspect. Since that\r\ntime, I admit, it has changed. Let us see now whether English\r\nindignation has not given to the act of Captain Wilkes greatly\r\nexaggerated proportions.\r\n\r\nEnglish indignation has omitted one side of the affair, I mean the\r\nconduct of the packet _Trent_. If, by chance, it should have violated\r\nthe principles of neutrality, this question would wear quite a different\r\naspect. This, doubtless, would not prevent the demand for reparation\r\nfrom being well founded; it would prevent the negotiations relating to\r\nit from assuming an air of harshness, which would suffice to render\r\ntheir success doubtful. Let us therefore examine the conduct of the\r\n_Trent_.\r\n\r\nSome have thought to justify it, by observing that the vessel was going\r\nfrom America. What does this matter? Neutrals are bound to act as\r\nneutrals when they are going from a place as well as when they are\r\ncoming towards it. They might as easily take sides with one of the\r\nbelligerents by carrying despatches, for instance, designed to secure to\r\nit aid, as by bringing it other despatches announcing that this aid was\r\nforthcoming.\r\n\r\nOthers have based their arguments on the fact that the _Trent_ had\r\nquitted a neutral port to repair to a neutral port. Again, a distinction\r\nwhich proclamations of neutrality have never admitted, and which no\r\njurisprudence has endorsed to my knowledge. What does plain good sense\r\ntell us, in fact? That your departure from a neutral port and your\r\ndestination to a neutral port do not hinder you in any way from serving\r\nthe belligerent whose despatches you have received, especially if these\r\ndespatches are on the way to solicit from a neutral country an alliance\r\nor supplies of munitions of war.\r\n\r\nThe rights of neutrals demand to be preserved, in my opinion, and France\r\nis interested in it more than any other nation. But these rights, let us\r\nnot fear to acknowledge, have for their fundamental condition, a _real_\r\nneutrality. Now, you take it upon yourself, knowingly and willingly, to\r\ncarry despatches destined for a country to which it is a notorious fact\r\nthat one of the belligerents is looking for its only serious chances of\r\nsuccess. These despatches are drawn up, it may be, in this wise: \"Let\r\nvessels loaded with arms and ammunition leave Southampton or Liverpool\r\nas quickly as possible and come to Charleston, where the cruisers are\r\nnow few in number; let expeditions be combined in such a manner as to\r\nforce the blockade; we are in need of their arrival in order to push our\r\narmy forward.\" Or else the despatches read: \"Buy up the newspapers and\r\nwork on public opinion in the manufacturing districts. Let maritime\r\npowers know that we will consent, if necessary, to cessions of territory\r\nor protectorates; that, in any case, we will grant them exceptional\r\nadvantages if they protest against the blockade, if they disquiet our\r\nenemy, if they seek a quarrel with him and draw off his attention to fix\r\nit on, an eventual struggle with Europe. At the first step of this kind,\r\nwe will attempt an offensive movement. The least menace against the\r\nblockade is worth as much to us as the despatch of an army.\" Is it not\r\nto mock at people, in the face of so new a position, of a war in which\r\none of the parties, though he does not fail to boast of his strength and\r\nhis resources, counts in fact, before every thing, upon European\r\nsupport, to propound fine theories in accordance with which the\r\ntransportation of despatches sent from a neutral port and destined for a\r\nneutral country, would not be contrary to neutrality, _because these\r\ndespatches could not increase the military advantages of either of the\r\nbelligerents?_\r\n\r\nIt has been sought to assimilate mail packets to vessels of war, and\r\nconsequently to except them from the exercise of the right of search.\r\nThe pretence is so ill-founded that it falls to the ground upon\r\nexamination. Who does not feel that the presence of a lieutenant of the\r\nroyal navy or the color of a uniform is not sufficient to constitute a\r\nvessel of war or a transport?\r\n\r\nIt is asked whether other packets, which have carried ministers sent by\r\nthe United States to Europe, have not also infringed the rules of\r\nneutrality? It is possible, but this does not concern us. Supposing that\r\nthe mission of these ministers in Europe, where they are regularly\r\naccredited like their predecessors to the different governments, and\r\nwhere they have no support, no new act, no violation of the blockade to\r\ndemand, may be assimilated to the mission of the Southern delegates;\r\nsupposing that their letters of credit bear some analogy to the\r\ndespatches intrusted to Messrs. Mason and Slidell, it belonged in any\r\ncase to the Southern cruisers to stop and search the packets in which\r\nthey had taken passage. The powerlessness of one of the belligerents\r\ncould not impose on the other the duty of abstaining in like manner.\r\n\r\nResting next on the diplomatic quality of the Southern envoys, it has\r\nbeen attempted to insinuate that their mission was purely a civil one.\r\nNot only did the diplomatic character not exist, since it had had no\r\nrecognition, but the Southern Commissioners were expressly charged\r\nwith, procuring to the armies of slavery the most essential assistance\r\nwhich they could receive in view of military success and strategy. Their\r\nsuccess, by ensuring the breaking of the blockade, would alone have been\r\nworth more to them than the winning of several battles. I say nothing,\r\nmoreover, of the shipments of arms and ammunition which they would have\r\ndoubtless organized in Europe.\r\n\r\nCan it be that mail packets have the singular privilege of facilitating\r\nsuch operations without failing in the duties of neutrality? If this be\r\ntrue, it is worth while to have it understood, and so long as it is not\r\nunderstood, we must make some allowance for belligerents who do not\r\nconsider it self-evident. It is clear that when the exercise of the\r\nright of search was defined by precedents and treaties, mail packets did\r\nnot exist. Perhaps it would be well to lay down special regulations\r\nconcerning them. This agreement might be profitably negotiated at\r\npresent between the United States and the maritime powers of Europe. Why\r\nshould not the conflict which occupies our attention, instead of ending\r\nin war, result in a useful negotiation? I have no doubt that the noble\r\novertures, the initiative of which has just been taken by General\r\nScott, would be approved by Mr. Lincoln. To enlarge the scope of the\r\npresent question, by causing an international progress, an emancipation\r\nof the commerce of the world to grow out of it, would be somewhat\r\nbetter, it seems to me, than to cut each other's throats and to ensure\r\nthe triumph in the middle of the nineteenth century of the most shameful\r\nrevolt that has ever broken out on earth--a revolt in favor of slavery.\r\nEngland and America, these two great countries, are worthy of giving to\r\nthe world the spectacle of a generous and fruitful mutual understanding\r\nin which a deplorable disagreement shall be swallowed up, as it were,\r\nand disappear. Who does not see that, combined with the promulgation of\r\na more liberal regulation of the right of search, the satisfaction\r\ndemanded of the United States would assume a new character, and would\r\nhave many more chances of being accorded?\r\n\r\nIt is the less difficult for the English to take this ground, since the\r\nact of the _San Jacinto_, in which the design of offending England in\r\nparticular might at first have been suspected, appears to-day under a\r\nvery different aspect. In proportion as we learn all the exploits of\r\nthis terrible vessel, its impartiality becomes less dubious. French,\r\nDanish, and other vessels were visited by it within a few days; it is\r\ncertain that if the French instead of the English mail packet had been\r\ncarrying the commissioners and their papers, the former would have been\r\nboarded by Captain Wilkes.\r\n\r\nHis mode of procedure was rough, and on this point apologies ought to be\r\nmade. Not indeed that England, who has just sustained in Prussia the\r\nfamous MacDonald negotiation, is in a very good position to show herself\r\ndifficult in points of courtesy; nevertheless, the errors of Great\r\nBritain in Germany do not excuse those of the United States on the\r\nocean. It appears that Captain Wilkes fired shot to enforce his first\r\norder to stop. The remainder was in keeping. Nevertheless, to give every\r\none his due, it is just to remember that he offered to take on board the\r\nfamilies of the commissioners and to give them his best cabins. It is\r\njust also to add that, after the arrest, the intercourse between the\r\nofficers of the _San Jacinto_ and the prisoners never ceased to be full\r\nof decorum and courtesy.\r\n\r\nLet us now approach more closely the question of right. It was well in\r\nthe first place to rid ourselves of secondary questions which hinder us\r\nfrom seeing it, and above all from seeing it as it is.\r\n\r\nThey seem to have been afraid in England to look this question of right\r\nboldly in the face. There is no subterfuge that they have not tried in\r\norder to avoid its serious investigation.\r\n\r\nHave they not gone so far as to object to the United States that,\r\nconsidering the Southern States as rebellious and refusing them the\r\nquality of belligerents, they could not exercise the right of search,\r\nwhich is reserved to belligerents? From this point of view they add,\r\nMessrs. Mason and Slidell would simply be rebels taking refuge under the\r\nEnglish flag; and what country would consent to give up political\r\nrefugees? The answer is simple: no country more than England has\r\nrecognized, in this instance, the quality of belligerents which her\r\npartisans are seeking to contest in her name. Moreover, the Southern\r\nblockade is admitted by her and by the other powers; now, blockade is as\r\nimpossible as right of search apart from a state of war.\r\n\r\nAnother subterfuge: the United States have always opposed the right of\r\nsearch--it ill becomes them to exercise it. England has always exercised\r\nthe right of search; it ill becomes her to oppose it. Let us be honest;\r\nrights of this kind are always odious to those who submit to them and\r\nalways dear to those who profit by them. Alas! this is not the only\r\ninstance in which, a change in our position works a change in our mode\r\nof viewing things. Let us take the human heart as it is, and not demand\r\nunder penalty of war, that the Americans, in the midst of one of the\r\nmost terrible social crises (and also of the most glorious) of which\r\nhistory makes mention, should hesitate to seize a weapon which was\r\nformerly used against them and which they feel the need of using in\r\nreturn. In neglecting to seize it, they would fail perhaps in their duty\r\nto themselves and to the noble cause of which they are the\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\nThere is finally a last and more simple manner of avoiding an\r\nembarrassing examination: \"What is the use of examining precedents?\" we\r\nhear on every side, \"This is not a matter for legal advisers.\" It\r\nappears to me, however, that it is something of the kind, since Great\r\nBritain has begun by interrogating the lawyers of the Crown, and since\r\nshe has made peace or war depend on the decision which they might\r\nrender. It would be too convenient, truly, to take exception to\r\nprecedents made by one's self, and to say to those who act as he has not\r\nceased to do: \"I permit no one to imitate me; what I practised in times\r\npast, I authorize no one to practise to-day. I have not apprised you of\r\nthis, but you ought to have divined it, and for not having divined it,\r\nyou shall have war.\"\r\n\r\nPrecedents keep then their full value. What are they?\r\n\r\nThe enemies of America have cited one which has nothing to do here; the\r\nletter written by King Louis Philippe to Queen Victoria to express his\r\nregret that a pilot under the protection of the British flag had been\r\ncarried away by the expedition bound to Mexico. A very different thing\r\nis an abduction of this kind, having nothing in common with the right of\r\nsearch or the maintenance of neutrality, and the capture of the Southern\r\nCommissioners.\r\n\r\nIt is in the familiar history of the right of search that precedents\r\nmust he sought, and they abound there.\r\n\r\nIn quoting some of them, I impose on myself a double law: first, I will\r\nnot confound acts of violence with precedents, and from the abuse which\r\nthe English made in times past of their maritime preponderance, I will\r\nnot conclude that every one is at liberty to do to-day as they have\r\ndone; secondly, among the grave and weighty authors who have made a\r\nspecial study of these questions in the quiet of their retirement, I\r\nwill confine myself to consulting none but English authorities.\r\nDoubtless, they will not think of challenging these in England.\r\n\r\nChancellor Kent writes: \"If, on making the search, it be discovered that\r\nthe vessel is employed hi contraband trade, that it transports the\r\nenemy's property, troops, or _despatches_, it may be rightfully seized\r\nand carried for adjudication before a prize court.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Phillimore, an English author and an authority on these questions,\r\nand one of the judges in the Admiralty, expresses himself thus: \"The\r\ncarrying of official despatches written by official personages on the\r\npublic affairs of one of the belligerents, _impresses a hostile\r\ncharacter on those bearing them_.\"\r\n\r\nSir William Scott is no less precise: \"The transportation of two or\r\nthree shiploads of ammunition is necessarily a limited assistance; _but,\r\nby despatches, the whole plan of the campaign may be transmitted in such\r\na manner as to destroy all the plans of the other belligerent in that\r\npart of the world.\"_ And he dwells at length on this idea, insisting on\r\nthe incompatibility which exists between veritable neutrality and the\r\nbearing of despatches, \"which is an act of the most prejudicial and\r\nhostile nature.\"\r\n\r\nLet us also cite Mr. Jenkinson, afterwards Lord Liverpool. He\r\nestablishes in clear terms the fundamental principle of the matter by\r\nputting this question, which plain good sense must answer: \"Can it be\r\nlawful for you to extend this right (that of the free navigation of\r\nneutral vessels) in such a way as to injure me and to serve my enemy?\"\r\n\r\nObserve that the Queen, in her proclamation of neutrality, has been\r\ncareful not to omit the interdiction of the transport of despatches. She\r\ntherein declares that those who transport \"officers, soldiers,\r\n_despatches_, arms, ammunition, or any other article considered by law\r\nand modern usage as contraband of war, for either of the contenders,\r\nwill do it at his own risk and peril, and will incur the high\r\ndispleasure of her Majesty.\"\r\n\r\nNothing can be more explicit, more consistent, and at the same time more\r\nreasonable than these declarations. Sir William Scott is right in\r\nsaying, that, in undertaking to carry despatches, persons cease to be\r\nneutrals and become enemies; this is evident, above all, in the present\r\nconflict. As the serious chances of success of the South are all in\r\nEurope, as it would not have revolted had it not counted on Europe, as\r\nit would lay down its arms to-morrow if it were proved to it that never,\r\nfor cotton or any thing else, would Europe come to its aid, it follows,\r\nthenceforth, that the despatches forwarded from the South to Europe\r\ngreatly surpass in military importance the sending of soldiers or\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\nThis being so, what ought the commander of the packet _Trent_ to have\r\ndone? I do not impugn his intentions, he may have acted very innocently;\r\nbut if this excuse of ignorance of the rules of the law be valid for\r\nhim, I think that it should also be so for Captain Wilkes, and that\r\nthere would be little justice in treating with extreme rigor a first\r\noffence which evidently has taken every one by surprise, and has found\r\nnowhere a very complete understanding of the conditions of the right of\r\nsearch.\r\n\r\nThe commander of the _Trent_ saw men come to him, whose quality as\r\nSouthern Commissioners challenged his attention. He knew what anxiety\r\nand trouble were pervading the North concerning their mission and\r\ndespatches, the contents of which excited grave suspicions; there had\r\neven been talk, exaggerated, doubtless, of a proposition of a\r\nprotectorate and other offers, designed to gain at any price the support\r\nof one or more maritime powers. The enthusiastic welcome which the\r\npeople of Havana, enemies of the United States, and ardent friends of\r\nslavery, had just given to Messrs. Mason and Slidell, permits no doubt\r\nof the especial gravity of the hostile mandate with which they were\r\ncharged. Then or never was the occasion to say that messengers and\r\nmessages of this nature must travel under their own flag, and that\r\nneutrals were bound not to facilitate their mission in any manner. In\r\ncircumstances so grave, and with such a responsibility, commanders of\r\npackets could not take refuge behind their innocence, or argue that the\r\nconsul of the United States had not taken pains to forewarn them. I\r\nshould like to know what reception a neutral would find in England, who\r\nshould take it into his head to say to her: \"I thought myself at liberty\r\nto carry hostile despatches and those bearing them, because the English\r\nconsul did not come to bind me to do nothing of the sort.\"\r\n\r\nIs it true, as has been maintained, that the fault was divided, the\r\nmessage having been carried by one packet and the messengers by another?\r\nThis appears doubtful, and matters little, moreover, in the eyes of\r\nimpartial judges. The fact is, that voluminous papers were seized on the\r\n_Trent_, at the same time with the rebel commissioners.\r\n\r\nNow, and to have done with the question of right, shall I say a few\r\nwords of what it is permissible to call the hackneyed rhetoric and\r\ndeclamation of the subject?\r\n\r\nMen have talked, of course, of an insult to the flag; they have called\r\nto mind that the deck of an English vessel is the same as the soil of\r\nthe country; they have invoked the rights of British hospitality, and\r\ndemanded whether she could consent to see her guests taken from her by\r\nforce. So many phrases for effect, which unhappily never fail to arouse\r\nimplacable passions! But what is there behind these phrases?\r\n\r\nThe flag is not insulted when the search is exercised in conformity with\r\nthe law of nations. It is in vain that the deck of an English merchant\r\nvessel is the soil of the country; a belligerent is authorized to seize\r\nit, if it is carrying men employed in behalf of the enemy; officers, for\r\nexample. The rights of hospitality are bounded by the duties of\r\nneutrality, and the vessel which would claim to protect its guests at\r\nany price, when its guests serve the war, would simply be guilty of a\r\nculpable action.\r\n\r\nIn brief, there are wrongs on both sides, and if ever difference\r\nadmitted of discussion, interpretation, if necessary, arbitration even,\r\nit is certainly this. Be sure, therefore, that Europe, attentive to all\r\nthat is passing, and desirous of averting war, will find it inexplicable\r\nif the question be put in insulting terms, of a nature to render\r\nhostilities almost inevitable.\r\n\r\nIf, in fine, Captain Wilkes had seized the vessel instead of seizing the\r\nCommissioners, and if the vessel had been duly condemned by an American\r\ncourt, the proceeding would have been irreproachably regular. This being\r\nso, by the acknowledgment of the English themselves, who will be willing\r\nto admit that any will be found bold enough to cause an irretrievably\r\nfatal rupture to grow out of a quarrel of this kind, concerning the mode\r\nof procedure. England has consulted her legal advisers; America will\r\nconsult hers also. Do disputes in which the national honor is involved\r\nadmit of consultations of this sort? Are lawyers or judges ever asked\r\nwhether the country is insulted or attacked when it really is so?\r\n\r\nLet England assure herself that the first condition of the demand for\r\nreparation is, that she shall make the reparation _possible_. Time is\r\nneeded. Patience is needed--patience which will not pause before the\r\nfirst difficulty, and take as final the first refusal. Courtesy is\r\nneeded--courtesy, which, in the stronger, agrees so well with dignity,\r\nand avoids rendering the form of satisfaction unnecessarily wounding and\r\nconsequently almost inadmissible. It is clear that if she contents\r\nherself with signifying to Washington an absolute demand, if she gives a\r\nsingle week, if she exacts (let us foresee the impossible) not only the\r\nsetting at liberty of the Commissioners themselves, but their\r\ntransportation on an American vessel charged to trail its repentant flag\r\nacross the seas, if she accepts no more easy mode, if she hearkens to no\r\nmediation, it is clear that Mr. Lincoln will need superhuman courage to\r\ngrant what she thus demands.\r\n\r\nThis superhuman courage I wish for him, I ask of him; in displaying it,\r\nhe will have deserved much of America and of humanity. But I hope little\r\nfor such marvels, nor do I believe that it is fitting to exact miracles\r\nin serious affairs.\r\n\r\nThe English were full of condescension and generosity towards America\r\nwhile she was strong. If they should be so unfortunate as no longer to\r\nhave condescension and generosity towards America, when she is weak,\r\nthey would warrant suppositions much more fatal to their honor than is\r\nthe grave error (yet easily reparable with the good will of both\r\nparties) just committed by Captain Wilkes.\r\n\r\nI have the right to hold this language to them, for I am of the number\r\nof those who lore England and have proved it. In my first parliamentary\r\nspeech, which was on occasion of this very right of search, I exposed\r\nmyself to much animosity in defending her. Later, in the Pritchard\r\naffair, I did not draw back. Even from the depths of my retreat, it has\r\nrarely happened to me to take up my pen without rendering homage to a\r\ncountry and government which are not popular among us. I have reason,\r\ntherefore, to hope that my words will have some weight. Nothing is more\r\nantipathetic to me than a coarse and ignorant anglophobia.\r\n\r\nBut it is important for England to know all the phases of the debate in\r\nwhich she has entered. It has a European phase. This is not a discussion\r\nbetween two powers; a third, the first of all, public opinion, must also\r\nhave its say. It wishes peace, and will not let it be sacrificed for an\r\nerror easily repaired and voluntarily exaggerated. Public opinion\r\nstrongly repudiates the cause of the South, which is that of slavery;\r\n(the speeches of Mr. Stephens, Vice-President of the Southern\r\nConfederacy, give proof of this.) At the announcement of the heinous\r\nfact that England recognizes the Confederacy expressly founded to\r\nmaintain, glorify, and extend slavery, public opinion, believe me,\r\nwould give vent to an outburst of wrath which would cast the indignation\r\nmeetings of Liverpool wholly in the shade.\r\n\r\nEngland has maintained her neutrality in the New World for the year\r\npast, and she deserves well for this, for angry instincts dictated to\r\nher another policy. However, if she has been neutral, she has not been\r\nsympathizing. This vast social revolution, which, began with the\r\nelection of Mr. Lincoln, which had inscribed on its banner, \"No\r\nextension of slavery,\" and which thus entered in the way leading one day\r\nto emancipation; this generous revolution which deserved to be\r\nencouraged, has met with little in England but distrust and hostility.\r\nUpon other points, while preserving her neutrality, England knows very\r\nwell how to give her moral support to causes which she loves--the\r\nsupport of journals, of parliamentary speeches, and of public meetings.\r\nHere, there is nothing of the sort. I know not what fatal\r\nmisunderstanding has kept down the generous sentiments which should have\r\nmade themselves felt. From the beginning, the principal English\r\njournals, especially those reputed to express the views of Lord\r\nPalmerston, have not ceased to proclaim openly that the South was right\r\nin seceding, that the separation was without remedy, that it was just\r\nand in conformity with the wishes of England. Again and again has the\r\nrecognition of the South been presented as an act to be expected and for\r\nwhich we must be prepared.\r\n\r\nFrom all this, if care be not taken, the inference will be drawn that,\r\nin the excessive eagerness with which the affair of the _Trent_ has been\r\nseized upon, in the peremptory terms of the demand for redress, in the\r\nform adopted in order to render the reparation difficult, may be seen\r\nthe intention of reaching the end which England proposes; of effecting\r\nthe recognition, breaking the blockade, obtaining cotton, and\r\nsubstituting a parcelled-out America for the too powerful Republic of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nLiverpool has, this time, given the signal, Lancashire urges on the\r\nrupture; behind the national honor, there may be something else. Take\r\ncare! if this must not be thought, it must not be true.\r\n\r\nAnd it will be true if you declare the question closed at the very\r\nmoment when it begins to attract public attention; if you exact a\r\nreparation without admitting an explanation; if, in short, you reject in\r\nadvance all idea of negotiation, mediation, or arbitration.\r\n\r\nWar, instead of negotiation, mediation, or arbitration; war, at the\r\nfirst word, for a question which has been submitted to legal advisers,\r\nand which offers facilities assuredly for several equally sincere\r\ninterpretations; _war at, any price_ does not belong to our times.\r\n\r\nWhat I say here, others will make it their business to say on the other\r\nside of the channel; there have been, there will be, liberal and\r\nChristian voices there, who will not fear to protest against the\r\nincitements of passion. We have heard little yet except the bells of the\r\nmanufactories; other sounds will soon make themselves heard; the great\r\nparty which, in abolishing slavery and combating the slave trade, has\r\nwon the chief title of honor in England--this great party, I think, is\r\nnot dead. It is time for it to give signs of life.\r\n\r\nAs to America, its friends are awaiting its final resolutions with an\r\nanxiety which I scarcely dare depict. Never was graver question placed\r\nbefore a government. The whole future is contained in it. If she be\r\nsufficiently mistress of herself to grant what is asked and to admit a\r\nreparation, even though it be excessive, of the fault evidently\r\ncommitted in her name, she will have the approbation and esteem of all\r\ntrue hearts. Her ship--the ship which brings, back the Commissioners\r\n--will be welcomed with acclamations to our shores, and it will\r\nbe plainly seen that the United States in yielding much is neither\r\nweakened nor humiliated.\r\n\r\nAh! the affair would he so easily arranged, if both sides desired it! On\r\nboth sides are men so worthy to effect a reconciliation for the glory of\r\nour times and the happiness of humanity! On both sides are nations so\r\nwell fitted to understand and to love each other! Must we despair then\r\nof the progress of the spirit of peace? Must we look with our own eyes\r\nupon English vessels employed in ensuring the success of the champions\r\nof slavery? Must we veil our head with our mantle?\r\n\r\nA. DE GASPARIN.\r\n\r\nVALLEYRES, (SWITZERLAND,) _December_ 5, 1861.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I wish to add here a single observation: I have not pretended to\r\nexhaust, in this rapid study, the decisions which might be borrowed from\r\nEnglish authors, and which would be of a kind to be appealed to by\r\nAmerica. Sir William Scott, for example, (see C. Robinson, p. 467,) says\r\nin express terms: \"_You may stop the ambassador of your enemy.\"_ I have\r\nbeen careful not to draw the conclusion from this, on my part, that\r\nCaptain Wilkes was right in acting as he did; I simply infer from it\r\nthat the case is by no means a hanging one, and that in stopping the\r\nCommissioners and their papers without stopping the ship and turning her\r\nfrom her course, he yielded perhaps (let us be just to all) to the\r\ndesire of not exposing the packet and passengers to serious\r\ninconveniences. Let us say that he was unfortunate, since his courtesy\r\non this point seems to have become the blackest of his misdeeds. In\r\ntruth, to see in the affair of the _Trent_, all that England has seen in\r\nit, it is necessary to commence by supposing that the United States,\r\nwhich have already a sufficiently heavy task on their hands, it seems to\r\nme, have been tempted, besides, to procure a quarrel with Great Britain.\r\nHypotheses of this kind will be welcomed only by those who feel\r\nthemselves unconquerably impelled to praise the messages of Mr.\r\nJefferson Davis, and to stretch their hand decidedly to the brave South,\r\nwhich has so much to complain of, and which is defending so just a\r\ncause![C]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote C: This article, with the exception of a few changes and\r\nadditions, was inserted in the _Journal des Débats_, December 11, 12,\r\nand 18.]",
