Yarmolinsky\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew York    Alfred A. Knopf    Mcmxvii\r\nCopyright, 1917, by\r\nAlfred A. Knopf\r\nPrinted in the United States of America\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREWORD\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is not merely a book about the Russian Jews. It is a marvellous\r\nrevelation of the Russian soul. It shows not only that the\r\noverwhelming majority of the Russian intellectuals, including nearly\r\nall of her brilliant literary geniuses, are opposed to the persecution\r\nof the Jews or any other race, but that they have a capacity for\r\nsympathy and understanding of humanity unequalled in any other land. I\r\ndo not know of any book where the genius and heart of Russia is better\r\ndisplayed. Not only her leading litterateurs but also her leading\r\nstatesmen and economists are represented--and all of them speak as\r\nwith a single voice.\r\n\r\nI am writing on the 16th of March. Yesterday the news reached the\r\nworld that Russia had probably at last succeeded in emancipating\r\nitself from the German-sustained and German-supported autocracy which\r\nso long has been renounced by practically all classes of the Russian\r\npeople. I have pointed out elsewhere that this Second Act of the great\r\ndrama of social transformation in Russia was to be expected in\r\nconnection with the present war. It is not surprising that this Act,\r\nlike the first--the Revolution of 1905--is accompanied by an\r\nirresistible demand for the cessation of the persecution of the Jews\r\nand other minority races. The first Duma, that of 1906, demanded\r\nunanimously that all these races be given absolutely the same rights\r\nas other Russians. The rise of Liberalism during the war, in\r\nconnection with military necessities, had already abolished a number\r\nof Jewish disabilities. There is no longer any question that the Jews\r\nwill be given equality. Without exception the anti-Semitic\r\norganisations were supported by the pro-German party, the money which\r\nwas alone responsible for the pogroms was furnished by these same\r\norganisations, and now this Party and these organisations are forever\r\noverthrown. It was Dr. Dubrovin, for example, who year by year carried\r\nout the murders of the leading representatives of the Jews in the Duma\r\nand who almost succeeded in having Milukov assassinated a few weeks\r\nago. Dubrovin was one of the most important of the sinister forces\r\nsupported by the money of the German Czarina's court party--which was\r\norganised by Baron Fredericks and other notorious Germans masquerading\r\nas Russians.\r\n\r\nThe re-birth of Russia which is now taking place cannot be understood\r\napart from the Jewish problem. As Russia's leading Liberal statesman,\r\nProf. Paul Milukov--who is well and favorably known in America because\r\nof extended visits here--points out in the article he contributes to\r\nthe present volume, the anti-Semitic parties coincide with the\r\nanti-constitutional parties. At first this seems a strange and\r\nunaccountable fact, but a brief glance at the history of other\r\ncountries will show that the party standing for the persecution of weak\r\nforeign neighbours and the oppression of minority races within and\r\nwithout a country has always and everywhere been the party of reaction.\r\nAs Milukov says, there was no need for an anti-constitutional movement\r\nuntil there was a constitutional movement. As soon as Liberalism\r\nappeared, however, and gained support among the masses, it was\r\nnecessary to fabricate some counter movement, and the governmental\r\nbureaucracy fixed upon anti-Semitism as a primitive means of appealing\r\nto the masses, and so of bridling them. It may be further pointed out\r\nthat this systematic propaganda against democracy was almost\r\nnon-existent in Russia until it had become thoroughly organised and\r\nsuccessful in Germany. Both Kovalevsky and Milukov demonstrate in the\r\npresent volume that anti-Semitism became an important factor in Russian\r\nlife only after the middle of the Nineteenth Century--that is to say,\r\nafter the final victory of Prussian Reactionism over German Liberalism\r\nin 1849 (a victory which has lasted to the present time)--and still\r\nmore, after the great military victories of Prussia from 1864 to 1870\r\nhad put Prussian militarism in the saddle and had made it the\r\ndominating force in the Russian court and Russian bureaucracy.\r\n\r\nHowever, the intelligence, energy, and courage of the Russian Liberals\r\nhas entirely thwarted this scheme to divide the Russian people. The\r\nbureaucracy has gained almost no support among any section of the\r\nRussian nation, except its own narrow circles, either for its\r\npersecution of the Jews or its oppression of the Poles, Finns,\r\nTartars, Armenians and other races. On the contrary, the anti-Semitic\r\npropaganda has reacted against its promoters. A considerable number,\r\nthough by no means a majority, of the Russian Liberals are Jews, and\r\nRussian Liberals do not at all endeavour to hide this fact. The\r\nconsequence is that the union of the Russian Liberals with all the\r\npersecuted races has been all the more firmly cemented. And just as\r\nall Russian Liberals are ardent supporters of the war against Germany,\r\nso practically all the leaders of the Russian Jews are equally\r\npatriotic--in spite of the fact that many forms of persecution have\r\nremained, and, furthermore, new forms of persecution have been\r\ninvented since the war. Though the German agitation in America has won\r\nover a large part of the Russian Jews in this country to the German\r\ncause, this agitation has had no such success in Russia, unless among\r\na relatively small proportion of the Jewish population.\r\n\r\nIt is known that the anti-Semitic agitation in Russia has taken hold\r\nof only a small proportion of the Russian people among the\r\nsemi-criminal population of the cities and towns. It is notorious that\r\nthe pogroms were often organised and carried out by the secret police\r\nand the cossacks, and that in other instances they were executed by\r\nbands of a few hundred bribed toughs, called by educated Russians \"the\r\nblack hundreds.\" This social element is what we would ordinarily call\r\nin America the \"mob,\" and it certainly does not constitute one per\r\ncent. of the population in Russia or in any other country. Gorky\r\nrefers to it as \"the populace\": \"In addition to the people, there is\r\nalso the 'populace,' something standing outside of social classes and\r\noutside of civilisation, and united by the dark sense of hatred\r\nagainst all that surpasses its understanding and is defenceless\r\nagainst brute force. I speak of the populace which thus defines itself\r\nin the words of Pushkin:\r\n\r\n    \"'We are insidious and shameless,\r\n    Ungrateful, faint-hearted and wicked;\r\n    At heart we are cold, sterile eunuchs,\r\n    Traducers, born to slavery.'\"\r\n\r\nThe refusal of the Russian people to be either bribed or deceived into\r\nhostility to the Jews is clearly enough demonstrated by the feeling\r\nof affection on the part of most intelligent Jews towards the Russian\r\npeople. The only exceptions are those Jews which come from the Polish\r\ncities far within the Jewish Pale and do not know the Russian people\r\nexcept by hearsay. Unfortunately, this is a considerable portion of\r\nthe total of the Jews in Russia, and it is from these cities and towns\r\nin the heart of the Pale that most of our immigrants come. But all the\r\nmore educated Jews--and a very large part are educated--all those who\r\nknow Russia either by a travel or through Russian literature and\r\nnewspapers, feel a deep affection for their country, for in spite of\r\nall, Russia belongs to them just as much as it does to other Russians.\r\nOne of the editors of the present volume, Fyodor Sologub, says:\r\n\r\n\"Whenever I met Russian Jews abroad, I always marvelled at the\r\nstrangely tenacious love for Russia which they preserve. They speak of\r\nRussia with the same longing and the same tenderness as the Russian\r\nemigrants; they are equally eager to return and equally saddened, if\r\nthe return is impossible. Wherefore should they love Russia, who is\r\nso harsh and inhospitable toward them?\"\r\n\r\nIt is useless for Americans to deceive themselves into thinking that\r\nthe Russian Jewish question is either unimportant or incomprehensible\r\nfrom the point of view of our progress and democracy. Do we not have\r\nour negro and Asiatic problems? Do not the English have their Irish\r\nand Indian questions? I do not suggest that the parallel is complete,\r\nbut it is clear that the Russian writers in the present volume are\r\nperfectly correct in referring both to our negro question and our\r\nquestion of yellow labour as closely similar to their Jewish problem.\r\nBoth the brilliant and fascinating discussions by Andreyev and\r\nMerezhkovsky will apply almost as well to any other so-called \"race\r\nquestion\" as to that of the Russian Jews. Says Merezhkovsky:\r\n\r\n\"We would like very much to say that there is no such thing as the\r\nJewish, Polish, Ukrainian, Armenian, Georgian, question; that there is\r\nonly one question--the Russian. Yes, we would like to, but we cannot;\r\nthe Russian people have yet to earn the right to say that, and therein\r\nlies their tragedy....\"\r\n\r\n\"'Judophilism' and 'Judophobia' are closely related. A blind denial of\r\na nationality engenders an equally blind affirmation of it. An\r\nabsolute 'Nay' naturally brings forth an absolute 'Yea.'\"\r\n\r\n\"That is why we say to the 'Nationalists': 'Cease oppressing the\r\nnon-Russian element of our empire, so that we may have the right to be\r\nRussians, and that we may with dignity show our national face, as that\r\nof a human being, not that of a beast. Cease to be 'Judophobes' so\r\nthat we may cease to be 'Judophiles.''\"\r\n\r\nIs it not clear from the recent discussion in the British Parliament\r\nthat the Irish problem weighs like an almost intolerable burden just\r\nas much upon the British Empire as it does upon Ireland? Is it not\r\nequally clear from England's concession of a cotton tariff to India\r\nthat she will be obliged for her own sake to make further concessions\r\nto justice in that country? And can America ever hope to have any\r\nstanding in the court of nations as long as our infamous persecution\r\nof the negroes and our atrocious attitude towards Asiatics continues?\r\nNations can indulge themselves for a certain period in such gross and\r\nstupid crimes, but the longer the settlement is postponed the greater\r\nthe blood-price that must be paid in the end--and in the meanwhile all\r\nour civilisation is poisoned, if not actually rotted, by the network\r\nof lies by which the persecutors are forced to defend their\r\ninfamies--lies which are necessarily more far-reaching and impudently\r\nfalse in a democracy than they are in an autocracy where the existing\r\nsystem maintains itself rather by force than by public opinion.\r\n\r\nBut few of us educated Americans have the intellectual and moral\r\ncourage of the educated classes of Russia. We feel that we can avoid\r\nour moral and intellectual responsibilities by turning our back on\r\nexisting crimes. It has frequently been pointed out that in spite of a\r\ngovernment even more anti-democratic than that of Germany, the Russian\r\npeople have been infinitely more democratic than the Germans. In the\r\nsame way, while the institutions of America are much further developed\r\nin the direction of general democracy than those of Russia, the very\r\nreverse is the case with public opinion. The educated classes of\r\nRussia have the courage and intelligence to call a spade a spade.\r\nThey realise that they are partly responsible for the sins committed\r\nby the Russian nation, even though they have been powerless heretofore\r\nto remedy these conditions in the face of an armed and organised\r\nautocracy, backed by the moral, intellectual and military force of\r\nGermany and by the money of France and England. Andreyev, for example,\r\nregards the Jewish problem as primarily a Russian problem. It is one\r\nof the chief burdens, if not the chief burden, which has been crushing\r\nthe Russian nation. In this book he says:\r\n\r\n\"When did the 'Jewish question' leap on my back?--I do not know. I was\r\nborn with it and under it. From the very moment I assumed a conscious\r\nattitude towards life until this very day I have lived in its noisome\r\natmosphere, breathed in the poisoned air which surrounds all these\r\n'problems,' all these dark, harrowing alogisms, unbearable to the\r\nintellect.\r\n\r\n\"And yet I, a Russian intellectual, a happy representative of the\r\nsovereign race, although fully conscious and convinced that the\r\n'Jewish question' is no question at all,--I felt powerless and doomed\r\nto the most sterile tribulation of spirit. For, all the clear-cut\r\narguments of my intellect, the most fervent tirades and speeches, the\r\nsincerest tears of compassion and outcries of indignation unfailingly\r\nbroke against a dull, unresponsive wall. But all powerlessness, if it\r\nis unable to prevent a crime, becomes complicity; and this was the\r\nresult: personally guiltless of any offence against my brother, I have\r\nbecome in the eyes of all those unconcerned and those of my brother\r\nhimself, a Cain.\"\r\n\r\nThe new Russia is being born while I write these lines, and\r\nintelligent Americans are discussing nothing else except this great\r\nworld event--comparable in importance even to the colossal war itself.\r\nIf we wish to understand educated Russia--which has brought about the\r\nchange--many-sided, large-hearted and intellectually more brilliant\r\nperhaps than the educated class of any other nation, we cannot do\r\nbetter than to read and think over what that galaxy of Russian genius\r\nthat has composed the present volume has written. We must not forget\r\nthat the educated class in Russia is almost as numerous as in the\r\nother great nations, and perhaps plays an even more important rôle in\r\nRussia than it does in other countries. What Russia has lacked has\r\nbeen neither an educated class nor masses capable and ready to be\r\ntrained to any kind of modern employment, but a great technically\r\ntrained, free and organised \"intellectual middle class\"--an expression\r\nI am forced to coin for my present purpose. It is hardly necessary to\r\nprove this assertion. The world is well acquainted with Russian genius\r\nin literature, art, music, philosophy, sociology, economics, history,\r\nand the higher realms of science. Moreover Russia is not without\r\ntechnological schools, but the proportion of her population employed\r\nin the scientific organisation of industry and business is\r\ninsignificant in comparison with that of other countries--owing, of\r\ncourse, to the backward state of Russian industry and Russian\r\ngovernment. But this fact, important as it is, must not obscure the\r\nequally important fact that the educated and cultivated class in\r\nRussia, speaking several languages, and personally familiar with the\r\ncivilisation of one or more foreign countries, exercises an influence\r\nover Russian society and Russian public opinion undoubtedly stronger\r\nthan that of any other educated class whatever--with the possible\r\nexception of that of Germany. We cannot hope to understand the new\r\nRussia unless we understand the character and point of view of the\r\nRussian \"intellegentsia,\" and this is nowhere so clearly, succinctly\r\nand interestingly set forth as in \"The Shield.\"\r\n\r\n                    WILLIAM ENGLISH WALLING.\r\n\r\nGreenwich, Connecticut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nPublished by the Russian Society for the Study of Jewish Life under\r\nthe joint editorship of three eminent men-of-letters, Gorky, Andreyev,\r\nand Sologub, the original Shield saw the light of day last year in\r\nPetrograd. The book consists of numerous studies, essays, stories and\r\npoems, all these contributions to the symposium on the Jewish question\r\ncoming exclusively from the pen of Russian authors of non-Jewish\r\nbirth. In making a selection for the present volume, I have thought it\r\nadvisable to give decided preference to the publicistic articles of\r\nthe original collection. Thus, the present version contains\r\npractically all the various important studies and essays of the\r\nRussian _Shield_, while most of the stories have been omitted, without\r\ngreat detriment to the book. I have also had to sacrifice, for obvious\r\nreasons, all the poetic contributions to the original, signed by such\r\ngreat masters of modern Russian poetry as Balmont, Bunin, Z. Hippins,\r\nSologub, and Shchepkina-Kupernik.\r\n\r\nMy thanks are due to Dr. Louis S.

We must make our own the ideas of law and\r\ncivil liberty: the usefulness of such an assimilation is clearly\r\ndemonstrated by the high degree of civilisation reached by the\r\nWestern countries, for instance, by England.\r\n\r\n\"We must develop in ourselves a moral tidiness, and an aversion to all\r\nthe manifestations of the brute principle in man, such as the wolfish,\r\ndegrading hatred for people of other races. The hatred of the Jew is a\r\nbeastlike, brute phenomenon; we must combat it in the interests of the\r\nquicker growth of social sentiments and social culture.\r\n\r\n\"The Jews are human beings, just like others, and, like all human\r\nbeings, the Jews must be free.\r\n\r\n\"A man who meets all the duties of a citizen, thereby deserves to be\r\ngiven all the rights of citizenship.\r\n\r\n\"Every human being has an inalienable right to apply his energy in all\r\nthe branches of industry and all the departments of culture, and the\r\nbroader the scope of his personal and social activities, the more does\r\nhis country gain in power and beauty.\"\r\n\r\nThere are a number of other equally elementary truths which should\r\nhave long since sunk into the flesh and blood of Russian society, but\r\nwhich have not as yet done so.\r\n\r\nI repeat--it is a hard thing to assume the rôle of a preacher of\r\nsocial proprieties and to keep reiterating to people: \"It is not good,\r\nit is unworthy of you to live such a dirty, careless, savage\r\nlife--wash yourselves!\"\r\n\r\nAnd in spite of all your love for men, in spite of your pity for them,\r\nyou are sometimes congealed in cold despair and you think with\r\nanimosity: \"Where then is that celebrated, broad, beautiful Russian\r\nsoul? So much was and is being said about it, but wherein does its\r\nbreadth, might and beauty actively manifest itself? And is not our\r\nsoul broad because it is amorphous? And it is probably owing to its\r\namorphousness that we yield so readily to external pressure, which\r\ndisfigures us so rapidly and radically.\"\r\n\r\nWe are good-natured, as we ourselves express it. But when you look\r\ncloser at our good-naturedness, you find that it shows a strange\r\nresemblance to Oriental indifference.\r\n\r\nOne of man's most grievous crimes is indifference, inattention to his\r\nneighbour's fate; this indifference is pre-eminently ours.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the Jews in Russia, which is a disgrace to Russian\r\nculture, is one of the results of our carelessness, of our\r\nindifference to the straight and just decrees of life.\r\n\r\nIn the interests of reason, justice, civilisation, we must not\r\ntolerate that people without rights should live among us; we would\r\nnever have tolerated it, if we had a strong sense of self-respect.\r\n\r\nWe have every reason to reckon the Jews among our friends; there are\r\nmany things for which we must be grateful to them: they have done and\r\nare doing much good in those lines of endeavour in which the best\r\nRussian minds have been engaged. Nevertheless, without aversion or\r\nindignation, we bear a disgraceful stain on our consciousness, the\r\nstain of Jewish disabilities. There is in that stain the dirty poison\r\nof slanders and the tears and blood of numberless pogroms.\r\n\r\nI am not able to speak of anti-Semitism in the manner it deserves. And\r\nthis not because I have not the power or the right words. It is rather\r\nbecause I am hindered by something that I cannot overcome. I would\r\nfind words biting, heavy, and pointed enough to fling them in the face\r\nof the man-haters, but for that purpose I must descend into a kind of\r\nfilthy pit. I must put myself on a level with people whom I do not\r\nrespect and for whom I have an organic aversion.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think that anti-Semitism is indisputable, just as\r\nleprosy and syphilis are, and that the world will be cured of this\r\nshameful disease only by culture, which sets us free, slowly but\r\nsurely, from ailments and vices.\r\n\r\nOf course, this does not relieve me of the duty to combat in every way\r\nthe development of anti-Semitism and, according to my powers, to\r\npreserve people from getting infected by it. The Jew of to-day is dear\r\nto me, and I feel myself guilty before him, for I am one of those who\r\ntolerate the oppression of the Jewish nation, the great nation, whom\r\nsome of the most prominent Western thinkers consider, as a psychical\r\ntype, higher and more beautiful than the Russian.\r\n\r\nI think that the judgment of these thinkers is correct. To my mind,\r\nJews are more European than the Russians are, because of their\r\nstrongly developed feeling of respect for work and man, if not for any\r\nother reason. I admire the spiritual steadfastness of the Jewish\r\nnation, its manly idealisms, its unconquerable faith in the victory\r\nof good over evil, in the possibility of happiness on earth.\r\n\r\nThe Jews--mankind's old, strong leaven,--have always exalted its\r\nspirit, bringing into the world restless, noble ideas, goading men to\r\nembark on a search for finer values.\r\n\r\nAll men are equal; the soil--is no one's, it is God's; man has the\r\nright and the power to resist his fate, and we may stand up even\r\nagainst God,--all this is written in the Jewish Bible, one of the\r\nworld's best books. And the commandment of love for one's neighbour is\r\nalso an ancient Jewish commandment, just as are all the rest, \"thou\r\nshalt not kill\" among them.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 the German-Jewish Union in Germany published \"The Principles\r\nof the Jewish Moral Doctrine.\" Here is one of these principles:\r\n\"Judaism teaches: 'Love thy neighbour as thyself' and announces this\r\ncommandment of love for all mankind to be the fundamental principle of\r\nJewish religion. It, therefore, forbids all kinds of hostility, envy,\r\nill-will, and unkindly treatment of any one, without distinction of\r\nrace, nationality and religion.\"\r\n\r\nThese principles were ratified by 350 rabbis, and published just at\r\nthe time of the anti-Jewish pogroms in Russia.\r\n\r\n\"Judaism teaches respect for the life, the health, the forces and the\r\nproperty of one's neighbour.\"\r\n\r\nI am a Russian. When, alone with myself, I calmly scrutinise my merits\r\nand demerits,--it seems to me that I am intensely Russian. And I am\r\ndeeply convinced that there is much that we Russians can and ought to\r\nlearn from the Jews.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the seventh paragraph of the \"Principles of the Jewish\r\nMoral Doctrine\" says: \"Judaism commands us to respect work, to take\r\npart by either physical or mental labour in the communal work, to seek\r\nfor life's goods in constant productive and creative work. Judaism,\r\ntherefore, teaches us to take care of our powers and abilities, to\r\nperfect them and apply them actively. It, therefore, forbids all idle\r\npleasure not based on labour, all idleness which hopes for the help of\r\nothers.\"\r\n\r\nThis is beautiful and wise, and this is just what we Russians lack.\r\nOh, if we could educate our unusual powers and abilities, if we had\r\nthe will to apply them actively in our chaotic, untidy existence,\r\nwhich is terribly blocked up with all kinds of idle clack and\r\nhome-spun philosophy, and which gets more and more saturated with\r\nsilly arrogance and puerile bragging. Somewhere deep in the Russian\r\nsoul--no matter whether it is the \"master's\" or the muzhik's--there\r\nlives a petty and squalid demon of passive anarchism, who infects us\r\nwith a careless and indifferent attitude toward work, society, people,\r\nand ourselves.\r\n\r\nI believe that the morality of Judaism would assist us greatly in\r\novercoming this demon,--if only we have the will to combat him.\r\n\r\nIn my early youth I read--I have forgotten where--the words of the\r\nancient Jewish sage--Hillel, if I remember rightly:\r\n\r\n\"If thou art not for thyself, who will be for thee? But if thou art for\r\nthyself alone--wherefore art thou?\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe inner meaning of these words impressed me with its profound\r\nwisdom, and I interpreted them for myself in this manner: I must\r\nactively take care of myself, that my life should be better, and I\r\nmust not impose the care of myself on other people's shoulders; but if\r\nI am going to take care of myself alone, of nothing but my own\r\npersonal life,--it will be useless, ugly and meaningless.\r\n\r\nThis thought ate its way deep into my soul, and I say now with\r\nconviction: Hillel's wisdom served me as a strong staff on my road,\r\nwhich was neither even nor easy. It is hard to say with precision to\r\nwhat one owes the fact that one kept on his feet on the entangled\r\npaths of life, when tossed by the tempests of mental despair, but I\r\nrepeat--Hillel's serene wisdom assisted me many a time.\r\n\r\nI believe that Jewish wisdom is more all-human and universal than any\r\nother, and this not only because of its immemorial age, not only\r\nbecause it is the first-born, but also because of the powerful\r\nhumaneness that saturates it, because of its high estimate of man.\r\n\r\n\"The true Shekinah--is man,\" says a Jewish text. This thought I dearly\r\nlove, this I consider the highest wisdom, for I am convinced of this:\r\nthat until we learn to admire man as the most beautiful and\r\nmarvellous phenomenon on our planet, until then we shall not be set\r\nfree from the abomination and lies that saturate our lives.\r\n\r\nIt is with this conviction that I have entered the world, and with\r\nthis conviction I shall leave it, and in leaving it I will believe\r\nfirmly that the time will come when the world will acknowledge that\r\n\r\n\"The holy of holies is man!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is unbearably painful to see that human beings who have produced so\r\nmuch that is beautiful, wise and necessary for the world, live among\r\nus oppressed by unfair laws, which in all ways restrain their right to\r\nlife, work and freedom. It is necessary,--for it is just and\r\nuseful--to give the Jew equal rights with the Russians; it is\r\nimperative that we should do so not only out of respect to the people\r\nwhich has rendered and is constantly rendering yeoman service to\r\nhumanity and our own nation, but also out of self-respect.\r\n\r\nWe must make haste with this plain, human reform, for the animosity\r\nagainst Jews is on the increase in our country, and if we do not make\r\nan attempt to arrest the growth of this blind hatred, it will prove\r\npernicious to our cultural development. We must bear in mind that the\r\nRussian people have hitherto seen very little good, and therefore,\r\nbelieve all the evil things that man-haters whisper in their ears. The\r\nRussian peasant does not manifest any organic hatred for the Jew,--on\r\nthe contrary, he shows an exceptional attraction for Israel's\r\nreligious thought, fascinating for its democratic spirit. As far as I\r\ncan remember, the religious sects of \"judaizers\" exist only in Russia\r\nand Hungary. In late years, the sects of \"Sabbathists\" and \"The New\r\nIsrael\" have been developing rather rapidly in our country. In spite\r\nof this, when the Russian peasant hears of persecutions of Jews, he\r\nsays with the indifference of an Oriental:\r\n\r\n\"No one sues or beats an innocent man.\"\r\n\r\nWho ought to know better than the Russian peasant that in \"Holy\r\nRussia\" the innocent are too often tried and beaten? But his\r\nconception of right and wrong has been confused from time immemorial,\r\nthe sense of injustice is undeveloped in his dark mind, dimmed by\r\ncenturies of Tartardom, boyardom, and the horrors of serfdom.\r\n\r\nThe village has a dislike for restless people, even when that\r\nrestlessness is expressed in an aspiration for a better life. We\r\nRussians are intensely Oriental by nature, we love quiet and\r\nimmobility, and a rebel, even if he be a Job, delights us in but an\r\nabstract way. Lost in the depth of a winter six months long, and wrapt\r\nin misty dreams, we love beautiful fairy-tales, but the desire for a\r\nbeautiful life is undeveloped in us. And when on the plane of our lazy\r\nthought something new and disquieting makes its appearance,--instead\r\nof accepting and sympathetically scanning it, we hasten to drive it\r\ninto a dark corner of our mind and bury it there, lest it disturb us\r\nin our customary vegetative existence, amidst impotent hopes and grey\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the people, there is also the \"populace,\" something\r\nstanding outside of social classes and outside of culture, and united\r\nby the dark sense of hatred against everything surpassing its\r\nunderstanding and defenceless against brute force. I speak of the\r\npopulace which thus defines itself in the words of Pushkin, our great\r\npoet, who himself suffered so cruelly from the aristocratic populace:\r\n\r\n    \"We are insidious and shameless,\r\n    Ungrateful, faint-hearted and wicked;\r\n    At heart we are cold, sterile eunuchs,\r\n    Traducers, born to slavery.\"\r\n\r\nIt is mainly this populace that is the bearer of the brute principles,\r\nsuch as anti-Semitism.\r\n\r\nThe Jews are defenceless, and this is especially dangerous for them in\r\nthe conditions of Russian life. Dostoyevsky, who knew the Russian soul\r\nso well, pointed out repeatedly that defencelessness arouses in it a\r\nsensuous inclination to cruelty and crime. In late years there have\r\nappeared in Russia quite a few people who have been taught to think\r\nthat they are the finest of the wheat, and that their enemy is the\r\nstranger, above all--the Jew. For a long time these people were being\r\npersuaded that all the Jews are restless people, strikers and rioters.\r\nThey were next informed that the Jews like to drink the blood of\r\nthievish boys. In our days they are being taught that the Polish Jews\r\nare spies and traitors.\r\n\r\nIf this preaching of hatred will not bring bloody and shameful fruits,\r\nit will be only because it will clash with our Russian indifference to\r\nlife and will disappear in it; it will split against the Chinese\r\nwall, behind which our still inexplicable nation is hidden.\r\n\r\nBut if this indifference be stirred up by the efforts of the hatred\r\npreachers,--the Jews will loom up before the Russian nation as a race\r\naccused of all crimes.\r\n\r\nAnd it is not for the first time that all the troubles of Russian life\r\nwill be blamed on the Jew; time and again was he the scapegoat for our\r\nsins. Only recently he paid with his life and goods for the help he\r\nrendered us in our feverish struggle for freedom. I think no one has\r\nforgotten the fact that our \"emancipatory movements\" strangely wound\r\nup with anti-Jewish riots.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the many-raced populace of Jerusalem demanded the death of the\r\ndefenceless Jew, Christ, Pilate, believing Christ innocent, washed his\r\nhands, but allowed him to be put to death.\r\n\r\nHow then will honest Russian men and women act in Pilate's place?\r\nTheir judgment is awaited.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] \"If I am not for myself who is for me? And being for my own self,\r\nwhat am I?\" \"Pirqe Aboth,\" I, 14.--Translator's Note.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST STEP\r\n\r\n\r\n   _Leonid Nikolayevich Andreyev, the author of impressive tales and\r\n   remarkable dramas, is well known both in America and in England.\r\n   Since the beginning of the Great War he has devoted himself to\r\n   the artistic portrayal of the war's effect on his country, and\r\n   also to purely publicistic tasks. He was born in 1871._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST STEP\r\n\r\nBY LEONID ANDREYEV\r\n\r\n    \"O heavens, if within your blue,\r\n    Old God is still alive and mighty,\r\n    Unseen by me alone, ye pray\r\n    For me and for my doom e'er bleeding!\r\n    My lips no more are fraught with hymns,\r\n    No brawn in arm, no hope in heart....\r\n    How long, how long, how long?\"\r\n\r\n             --H. BYALIK.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is with deep emotion that I have read in the Polish _New Gazette_\r\nan interview about the Jewish question with a personage of high\r\nstation who seems to be really well informed. According to this\r\npersonage, a number of measures are being proposed and planned, which\r\nare intended to lighten the grievous lot of the Jews in Russia: the\r\nabolition of the \"Pale of Settlement\" in relation to towns large and\r\nsmall, the abrogation of the percentage \"norm\" in the secondary and\r\nhigher educational institutions, the establishment of special Jewish\r\nschools, the reorganisation of Jewish emigration on a broad and\r\nrational basis. I confess that I was not prompt in giving credence to\r\nthese good tidings. And those with whom I shared the news, although\r\nexcited no less than I, accepted them also with some degree of\r\ndiffidence, which is only natural in Russians: life indulges us so\r\nrarely and so reluctantly. But private rumours corroborate this news,\r\nand to persist in one's disbelief would mean to doubt the very meaning\r\nof the present great \"emancipatory\" war, which is building a glorious\r\ntemple of renovated life on the blood of Russians, Poles, Jews and\r\nLithuanians. And finally, I simply cannot help believing, for my soul\r\nis weary with waiting and repeating together with the great Jewish\r\npoet: \"How long, how long, how long?\"\r\n\r\nAn aged journalist, who, it seems, has lost all fervour and faith, has\r\nrecently laughed in his sleeve at the word \"miracle,\" which nowadays\r\ncomes so often to our lips: according to him, miracles, generally\r\nspeaking, do not exist. It is my opinion also that there are no\r\nmiracles, if we understand by a miracle an arbitrary violation of the\r\nnatural, logical, inevitable order of things. But to him who\r\ncontemplates life proper, not the table of multiplication,--logic\r\nitself appears as the greatest of all miracles. Oh, if logic would\r\nreally reign supreme in life; oh, if in our cursed human existence,\r\nwhere there are so many aimless and unnecessary sorrows and tears and\r\nwild outrages, the simplest \"two and two is four\" would not be the\r\nrarest of miracles, equal to the transubstantiation of water into\r\nprecious wine. Would millions of individually innocent human beings\r\nperish in this most terrible of wars, if instead of a dark and\r\nterrible _alogism_ a clear and lucid syllogism lay at the basis of our\r\nintricate and enigmatical existence? It is logic that is the true\r\nmiracle, and \"two and two is four\" is that extraordinary happiness,\r\nwhich falls so seldom to our lot!\r\n\r\nAnd just as I rejoiced as at miracles, at Russia's achievement of\r\ntemperance, and Poland's rebirth in the same way, I now marvel at the\r\ncoming solution of the \"Jewish question,\" the immemorial and darkest\r\nof alogisms. There is something festive in it; it stirs up in me a\r\nfeeling of serene and immense joy, bordering on religious\r\nexaltation.... And the fact that for me, as well as for many other\r\nRussian writers, _all this_ was never even a problem, does not by any\r\nmeans diminish the extraordinary character of what is going to happen;\r\nfor a plain brotherly kiss is almost a miracle and can move one to\r\ntears at the time when the rule of life and its highest wisdom is a\r\nfierce war of brother against brother.\r\n\r\nAnd how can I help feeling this extraordinary import, I, a Russian\r\nintellectual, if, together with the solution of the \"question\" my\r\nsoul, too, is suddenly set free. It is delivered from all the habitual\r\nand harrowing experiences that, constant companions of my days and\r\nnights as they have been, have acquired all the peculiarities of those\r\nchronic and incurable ailments, to which the grave alone can bring\r\nrelease. For, if to the Jews themselves the \"Pale,\" the \"norm,\" etc.,\r\nwere a fatal and impregnable fact, which deformed their entire life,\r\nthey were also for me, a Russian, something in the nature of a hump on\r\nmy back, a stationary and ugly growth, arising no one knows when or\r\nunder what circumstances. Wherever I went and whatever I did, the hump\r\nwas with me; at night it disturbed my sleep, and in my waking hours,\r\nwhen I was among people, it filled me with feelings of confusion and\r\nshame.\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention to demonstrate the soundness and justice of the\r\nproposed measures and to force the door which to me was always open,\r\nbut I am going to take the liberty of adding a few more words about my\r\nhump. When did the \"Jewish question\" leap on my back?--I do not know.\r\nI was born with it and under it. From the very moment I assumed a\r\nconscious attitude towards life until this very day I have lived in\r\nits noisome atmosphere, breathed in the poisoned air which surrounds\r\nall these \"problems,\" all these dark, harrowing alogisms, unbearable\r\nto the intellect.\r\n\r\nWho needs it? Whom does it benefit? If all this exists and is\r\nsupported, if there are people who assert it fiercely and firmly,\r\nthere must be some definite sense in it; evidently, the Pale, the\r\neducational norm, and the rest increase mankind's sum of joy, exalt\r\nlife, broaden the limits of human possibilities. Taking a logical\r\npoint of departure, that is what I thought, but this same logic\r\ndictated to me an absolutely negative answer to all these questions:\r\nno one needs it, it brings good to no one: all these discriminations\r\nnot only do not increase the sum of joy on this earth, but engender a\r\nmultitude of wholly unnecessary, aimless sufferings; some they\r\noppress, and others they badly corrupt. And yet I, a Russian\r\nintellectual, a happy representative of the sovereign race, although\r\nfully conscious and convinced that the \"Jewish question\" is no\r\nquestion at all,--I felt powerless and doomed to the most sterile\r\ntribulation of spirit. For, all the clear-cut arguments of my\r\nintellect, the most fervent tirades and speeches, the sincerest tears\r\nof compassion and outcries of indignation unfailingly broke against a\r\ndull, unresponsive wall. But all powerlessness, if it is unable to\r\nprevent a crime, becomes complicity; and this was the result:\r\npersonally guiltless of any offence against my brother, I have become\r\nin the eyes of all those unconcerned and those of my brother himself,\r\na Cain.\r\n\r\nThe first consequence of my fatal powerlessness was that the Jew did\r\nnot trust me, which meant that I lost my self-confidence. Living\r\ntogether with the Jews as my co-citizens, being in constant personal\r\nand business relations with them, in the field of consorted social\r\nwork, I came face to face with the Jewish \"problem\" every single\r\nday,--and every single day of my life I felt with intolerable keenness\r\nall the falsehood and wretched ambiguity of my situation, that of an\r\noppressor against one's will. In the doctor's office, at my desk, in\r\nthe editorial room, in the street, finally in jail, where together\r\nwith the Jew I fulfilled the all-Russian prison duty--everywhere I\r\nremained the privileged \"Russian,\" the representative of the sovereign\r\nrace, the baron,--without the baronial blazon. And with horror I\r\nnoticed that even the eyes of a Jew-friend were dimmed with strange\r\nshadows ... that terrible images surged behind my friendly Russian\r\nshoulders and mingled wholly unsuitable noises and voices with my\r\nsincere plea for \"world citizenship.\" ... And yet he knew me well, he\r\nknew my attitude toward the Jews,--how about those who know only that\r\nI am a \"Russian\"?\r\n\r\nI remember having spent one night in talking with a very gifted\r\nwriter, a Jew, who was my casual and most welcome guest. I was trying\r\nto convince him that he, a great master of the word, ought to write,\r\nbut he repeated obstinately that although he loves the Russian\r\nlanguage with all his artist's heart, he cannot write in it, in the\r\nlanguage which has the word _zhid_.[1] Of course, logic was on my\r\nside, but on his side there was some dark _truth_--truth is not always\r\nlucid--and I felt, that my ardent arguments began, little by little,\r\nto sound like false and cheap babbling. So that I have not succeeded\r\nin convincing him, and when we parted I had not the courage to kiss\r\nhim: how many _unexpected_ meanings could be disclosed in this plain,\r\neveryday token of friendship and affection?\r\n\r\nThings are altogether bad when even a kiss becomes suspicious and can\r\nbe susceptible of \"interpretation,\" as a complicated act of intricate\r\nand enigmatic relations! That is exactly what happened. And how many\r\nodd and nightmare-like misunderstandings were engendered by the\r\npoisonous mist in which we all wandered, both friends and foes, and in\r\nwhich the outlines of the plainest objects and feelings assumed the\r\ndismal grotesqueness of phantoms. I cannot help recalling here the\r\ncase of E.A. Chirikov, which at the time excited much comment: the\r\nnoble and fervent champion of the persecuted race, the author of the\r\ndrama \"Jews,\" which has more than any other Russian drama contributed\r\nto the dispersion of the evil prejudice,--this man was suddenly, in a\r\nmost absurd manner, without a shadow of foundation, insulted by the\r\naccusation of anti-Semitism; and--to think of it!--it was necessary to\r\nfurnish _proofs_ that the accusation was false. What a painful, what a\r\nwholly disgraceful absurdity!\r\n\r\n\"Who needs all this? Who does not know it?\" wearily thought every one\r\nof us, again and again realising the harrowing necessity of convincing\r\nsome unbeliever, that two and two is four ... nothing but four!\r\n\r\nAnd abroad? \"What an injustice!\"--thought I, when the cultured West,\r\nhaving separated me from Tolstoy, as if I had stolen him, handed me on\r\nthe spot, a bill for the \"excesses\" known the world over, at the same\r\ntime frowning unambiguously upon my eternal hump. The West refused to\r\nconsider that I, too, am against _this_. I was considered a Russian,\r\nand the question was put this way: \"Tell me, why in your country, in\r\nRussia?...\"\r\n\r\nIt is ridiculous and utterly odd to think that our far-famed\r\n\"barbarism\" of which our enemies accuse us and which puts our friends\r\nout of countenance, is based wholly and exclusively on our Jewish\r\nquestion and its bloody excesses. Take away from Russia these\r\nexcesses, leave, if you wish, the anti-Semitism, but in that\r\nexternally decorous form in which it still exists in the backward\r\nportions of Europe,--and we shall become at once decent Europeans, and\r\nnot Asiatics and barbarians, whose proper place is beyond the Ural.\r\nThis is a fact the obviousness of which every new day of the present\r\nwar makes more strikingly evident.\r\n\r\nOf course culturally we are far behind the world, our economic life is\r\nundeveloped, our civic life is at a low level, and all the aspects of\r\nour life show clearly that we have not as yet broken the shell of the\r\negg. But we are young, we are only beginning, and for a people who\r\nabolished serfdom only half a century ago, we have done quite a good\r\ndeal,--so that, at the worst, lack of culture is the only reproach\r\nwhich a European with a sense of justice will fling at us. But it is\r\nenough to put side by side the words \"Russian\" and \"Jew,\"--and I\r\nbecome at once a barbarian, a dark and terrible being, who chills and\r\ndarkens resplendent Europe. At once in America people begin to hate\r\nme, in England and France to despise me; with the swiftness of\r\ntheatrical transformations Tolstoy's compatriot turns into the brother\r\nof those who drive nails into their neighbours' heads,--I become a\r\n_barbarian_. And even the German anti-Semite, a stupid and dull\r\ncreature, looks down at me and warns England: \"See with whom you are\r\nfriends? Are they not the same people who...?\"\r\n\r\n\"To whose interest is it that Europe should despise me, hate and fear\r\nme?\" I mused, perplexed, feeling that in the light of the European sun\r\nmy cursed hump assumes immense proportions and like a screen shuts off\r\nthe light which comes from the East, and in which the aged and weary\r\nWest is quite inclined to believe. To whom is it necessary for me to\r\nramble among the cultured nations like a leper, to conceal my race and\r\nobtain the ironical bow so essential to my unacknowledged dignity, by\r\nmeans of exorbitant \"tips\" flung right and left? A barbarian, a\r\nbarbarian!...\r\n\r\nThe war has opened our eyes to many things, and therein lies for us\r\nRussians the sad advantages of it. And now when Germany brands France\r\nand England for the union with \"the Russian barbarians who...,\" when\r\nthe allies, while relying on our elemental force, tremble with doubts\r\nand fear behind the screen of their noisy sympathies,--I begin to\r\nunderstand in whose interests it was, who needed it, that in the\r\nlegion of European states we should remain all alone with our\r\nbarbarism. Whatever is a misfortune for us is favourable for Germany,\r\nwith her \"well-tried\" friendship for us, to which Wilhelm referred so\r\nloudly from the balcony of his palace. As barbarians we are only an\r\nexcellent and indispensable market for the Germans' merchandise, a\r\ntwo-hundred-million flock of sheep ready for the shears. As a cultured\r\nnation we are a power dangerous to the Teuton's dream of world\r\ndominion. And the Jewish question, with its excesses and nails driven\r\ninto heads, is that trump which our honest German neighbour has always\r\nkept hidden in his cuff and which he throws out on the green table at\r\nthe necessary moment. And he was right from his standpoint. But why\r\nhad we to drink off the bitter cup? Losing our self-respect, having no\r\nfaith in our power, growing corrupted by an unnatural existence,\r\ncutting down by means of the celebrated \"norm\" the number of our\r\neducated and cultured men--a devilish joke!--our entire nation was\r\ndiligently performing the \"Fools' Dance,\" which, under the name of a\r\ndrama from Russian life, has recently met with such a success in the\r\nBerlin playhouses. It must not be forgotten that the ardent Polish\r\nanti-Semitism, which frightens us so much and which seriously hinders\r\nthe upbuilding of a new life, as well as the cold Finnish\r\nanti-Semitism, the power of which is still unknown to us,--that these\r\ntwo phenomena are nothing but the logical development of the\r\nfundamental absurdity, its natural and poisonous fruits. But the time\r\nhas not come yet to speak about that.\r\n\r\nMay I be pardoned that in an hour so momentous for the Jews I persist\r\nin speaking not of them and their sufferings, but of ourselves. I\r\nrepeat, the Jewish question was never a question for me, and in order\r\nto justify the proposed measures I need not allege the heroism shown\r\nby the Jews in defending Russia, their love for Russia, tragic in its\r\nfaithfulness. As for demonstrating again and again that a Jew, too, is\r\na human being, to do so would mean not only to bow too low to\r\nabsurdity, but also to insult those whom I respect and love. And if I\r\npersist in speaking of ourselves and our suffering, it is not for\r\npersonal egoism, nor even class egoism, but the pardonable egoism of a\r\nnation, which has been too long playing a miserable part on Europe's\r\nstage and in its own conscience, and which now repudiates the\r\nsuffering of yesterday and, at the dawn of new life, seeks the\r\npossibility--oh, only the possibility!--of respecting itself.\r\n\r\nYes, we are still barbarians, the Poles still mistrust us, we are a\r\ndark terror for Europe, a baffling menace to her civilisation, but we\r\ndo not want to be that any more, we long for purity and reason, our\r\nwretched rags burden us beyond all measure. The Jews' tragic love for\r\nRussia finds a counterpart in our love for Europe, as tragical in its\r\nfaithfulness and completeness. Are we not ourselves the Jews of Europe,\r\nand is not our frontier--the same \"Pale of Settlement\"--something in\r\nthe nature of a Russian Ghetto? And try as our Pushkin and Dostoyevsky\r\nand your Byalik may to prove that we, too, are human beings, people do\r\nnot believe us, as they do not believe you: here is that equality\r\nwhence we all can derive a bitter consolation; here is the punishment\r\nby means of which impartial life takes revenge on the Russians for the\r\nJews' sufferings.\r\n\r\nThe thirst for self-respect--that is the fundamental feeling which\r\nnow, in the days of the most terrible war, has seized all Russian\r\nsociety, which has exalted the people to the heights of heroism, and\r\nwhich makes us fear all that reminds us of our sad past. That is why\r\npersecution of Germans in our own country is so unbearable to us; we\r\nwant no persecution; that is why we hate all that, like the belching\r\nof yesterday's drinking, distorts our disinterested aims and\r\nintentions: better yield than take too much of what belongs to other\r\npeople--that is nowadays the motto of the majority. Could the country\r\nbecome sober if not for this feeling which one has when about to\r\nreceive holy communion? Although proud at the victories of our arms,\r\nwe scrupulously hide this pride, we treasure it in our hearts as our\r\nmost precious possession, and we hate all swaggering and\r\nself-adulation. Not with the haughtiness of a righteous pharisee do we\r\napproach the altar, but with a prayer of penitence: \"like a murderer I\r\nprofess Thee.\"\r\n\r\nWe must all understand that the end of Jewish sufferings is the\r\nbeginning of our self-respect, without which _Russia cannot exist_.\r\nThe black days of war will pass, and the \"German barbarians\" of to-day\r\nwill again become cultured Germans, to whose voice the world will once\r\nmore hearken with deference. And we must never again allow this or any\r\nother voice to utter aloud: \"The Russian barbarians.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] This is an insulting synonym for \"Jew.\"--Translator's Note.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR.

He was born in 1853._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. JACKSON'S OPINION ON THE JEWISH QUESTION\r\n\r\nBY VLADIMIR KOROLENKO\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most intelligent though not one of the most profound\r\nopinions about the Jewish question I happened to hear from a chance\r\nfellow-traveller on the Atlantic Ocean. And although it was quite some\r\ntime ago, and the man who expressed it was in no way remarkable,\r\nnevertheless this opinion is recalled to me on various occasions--very\r\nfrequently in these days.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1904. Together with a fellow countryman, also a man of\r\nletters, I was travelling aboard a steamer of the Anglo-American\r\nCompany, \"Cunard.\" Our cabin was small and narrow. It was lighted by\r\nthe dull light of an electric bull's-eye in the ceiling which served\r\nas a deck. There were three berths and a wash basin. My friend and I\r\noccupied two of the berths. On the third there camped the gentleman\r\nabout whom we read in the passenger list: \"Mr. Henry Jackson of\r\nIllinois.\" This was all we knew about him for the first few days. He\r\nrose very early, went to bed late and spent all day outside of the\r\ncabin. As a rule, we woke early, because to the muffled and steady\r\nsplash of the ocean over the sides of the ship there was added a\r\nsplash issuing from the basin, nearby. By the dim light of the\r\nbull's-eye I could see from my top berth a tall figure in a nightshirt\r\nas long as a shroud, with a small bald spot on the pate. Out of\r\ndelicacy he did not turn on the electric lights and in the\r\nsemi-darkness made his toilet very quietly, but was not able to forego\r\nthe pleasure of emitting some snorts while splashing himself with cold\r\nwater from the basin. Then he dived again into his berth and for some\r\ntime quietly and cautiously busied himself there; then--a light squeak\r\nof the door, and a long figure glided out from the cabin. We were\r\ninterested in the personality of our neighbour. He was the first\r\nAmerican whom fate had brought so near to us. We were unable even to\r\ndistinguish his face and during the day tried to single him out in\r\nthe international crowd of gentlemen scurrying about the deck of our\r\n_Urania_, lounging on the deck-chairs, having luncheon, or dinner or\r\nsupper, or lost in the smoke of cigars in the smoking room. This\r\nelusiveness made the personality of the traveller puzzling and\r\ninteresting, and we bestowed the title of \"Our American\" now on one,\r\nnow on another of the middle-aged American gentlemen. Of course, we\r\nmarked as candidates the more interesting and typical figures. The\r\n_Urania_ had been on the ocean for quite some time when my friend at\r\nlast said to me: \"I have found out which American is ours. Here he\r\ncomes now. Look!\"\r\n\r\nAlong the railing, a lanky gentleman and a short stout lady were\r\ncoming toward us. I felt a sense of involuntary disappointment: both\r\nhe and she were the least interesting of all the first-class\r\npassengers on the _Urania_.\r\n\r\nA kind of half-European, half-exotic troupe were on the boat. They\r\nwere going to America for a tour. The central figures in the group\r\nwere two beautiful Creoles who had already succeeded in gaining a\r\nreputation in Europe. Around them were grouped a few stars of smaller\r\nmagnitude, and the whole constellation attracted considerable\r\nattention from the men of the various nationalities represented on\r\nboard. Soon a few couples circling the decks together came into\r\nnotice. Amongst them were the lanky gentleman and the short, very\r\nvulgar lady, who looked like a maid or a duenna. As they passed in\r\nfront of the other couples, one could sometimes notice slightly\r\nironical glances and meaning smiles. But \"our\" American had a most\r\nself-satisfied, even somewhat victorious look. My companion,\r\nwell-versed in English soon made a few acquaintances. Most often I saw\r\nhim converse with \"our\" American in the hours when the latter was free\r\nfrom his knightly duties. Pretty soon we gained an insight into the\r\nmain facts of his life-history. We learned that in his youth he had\r\nfollowed in turn a number of various callings, until one of them\r\nbrought him success. He had retired and was now living on his large\r\nincome, had provided very well for his two sons, had lost his wife,\r\nand decided to devote to pleasure the rest of his life which had begun\r\namidst drudgery and many vicissitudes. He spent his time in\r\ntravelling from one son to the other and retiring now and then to his\r\nown well-furnished home in Chicago. \"When travelling you very often\r\nhave very interesting adventures, don't you?\" And he shot a triumphant\r\nand sly glance in the direction of his artistic lady.\r\n\r\nHaving learned that we were Russian writers, he decided at once that\r\nwe were going to the Exhibition in the capacity of correspondents.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, in my hard days I ate bread baked in this oven, too,\" he\r\nsaid, with an air of satisfaction. \"There are many occupations which\r\nare more respectable and profitable.... But one tries everything. I\r\ncan give you a good piece of advice. On the first train which will\r\ntake you into the interior of the country, you will encounter a young\r\nman who offers illustrated guide-books for sale. Do not grudge your\r\nhalf-dollar, and buy these guide-books as frequently as possible. You\r\nwill find in them excellent descriptions of noteworthy places, written\r\nby real masters. You can draw from them quite liberally. Even we,\r\nAmericans, cannot know all our guide-books, as for Russia.... Heh-heh!\r\nBefore reaching Chicago you will have several thousand lines.... Your\r\nreaders will be satisfied, and so will your editor and you will earn\r\nyour pay easily.... What?... Isn't that so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Much obliged, sir!\" answered my companion with ironical civility, and\r\nadded in Russian: \"The swine! He is cock-sure that he has benefited us\r\nhighly by his advice.\"\r\n\r\nMy companion had a strong sense of humour, and every day he had some\r\nnew episode, some characteristic opinion held by the American or some\r\nstory of his past to tell me. Sometimes he would take out his\r\nnote-book and make believe he was respectfully taking notes on some\r\nespecially happy passages from these enlightening conversations. And\r\nat the same time he would say to me in Russian:\r\n\r\n\"He is deeply convinced that America is the best country in the world,\r\nIllinois is the best State in America, the street he lives on is the\r\nbest street in his city, and his house the best house on the street.\r\nNow he is trying to persuade me that Chicago outgrew New York long ago\r\nand is now the first city in the world. Wait a minute ... there comes\r\nanother one. That one is a New Yorker.\" He stopped the gentleman who\r\nwas passing by and proceeded to introduce them to each other:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Jackson of Illinois, Mr. Carson of New York.\"\r\n\r\nThen in the naïve tone of a person, somewhat perplexed, he asked:\r\n\r\n\"You told me that New York is the first city in the world. And here is\r\nMr. Jackson who asserts that for the last ten years Chicago has\r\noutstripped New York in population. According to him Chicago has so\r\nmany million inhabitants.\"\r\n\r\nMy companion leaned back slightly in his arm-chair and looked with\r\nobvious curiosity at the two Americans.\r\n\r\n\"Presently we shall have a cock-fight,\" he said to me in Russian, and\r\na mocking twitch appeared beneath his moustache.\r\n\r\nMr. Carson straightened up. His eyebrows lifted impatiently but\r\nimmediately his face took on an expression of polite calm, and\r\nslightly tipping his hat, he said: \"It is very possible ... the\r\ngentleman evidently includes the population of the cemeteries of\r\nChicago.\"\r\n\r\nHe bowed and resumed his walking, leaving Mr. Jackson aghast with\r\nmouth wide-open, speechless, for he had not time to protest. Then he\r\ngot up quickly and walked along the deck.... My companion followed him\r\nwith his smiling eyes....\r\n\r\n\"Perfect parrots,\" he said. \"Petty patriotism, in its most naïve\r\nform.... Dickens long ago noticed that trait of American character and\r\nso it goes on.\" My sly countryman skilfully interviewed his victim,\r\ndisclosing step by step the ludicrous traits of a Yankee. There were\r\nmany weak sides. Mr. Jackson, in whom we were mainly interested,\r\nproved to be a mediocre person in all respects, with a naïvely\r\nmiddle-class outlook on life, and we, the two Russian observers,\r\nrevelled in that delightful malice which is so characteristic of\r\nRussians abroad. So that is what they are, the far-famed children of\r\nthe transatlantic republic!\r\n\r\nSometime later, I again found my companion engaged in conversation\r\nwith Mr. Jackson. The ocean was somewhat rough. The ladies did not\r\ncome out on deck; Mr. Jackson was, therefore, free and evidently in\r\nhigh spirits. He spoke with great animation. My companion had his\r\nnote-book in his hands and there was a slyly respectful smile on his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"We are discussing the Jewish question,\" he said in Russian. \"Mr.\r\nCarson, a quarter of an hour ago, praised the Jews, and ever since\r\n'our man' cannot calm down. He enlightens me with arguments which\r\nsound as if they were just taken from our yellow newspapers. Please,\r\ngo on, sir,\" he respectfully addressed Mr. Jackson. \"Everything you\r\nsay is so new and interesting....\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jackson, who was flattered by the respectful attention of the\r\nnaïve Russian, continued his sermon. It was before the days of the\r\nBeyliss trial. Nevertheless, except for the \"ritual\" murder, all the\r\nrest of the jargon of our anti-Semitic papers was there, and the\r\nJewish character was painted the most frightful black.\r\n\r\nOn the other end of the deck resounded the shrill sound of the gong, a\r\nsignal for lunch.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said my companion. \"It is with great pleasure that I\r\nhave listened to your views on the subject, and I am certain that all\r\nthis will be found extremely novel in our country.... I have a few\r\nmore minutes to ask you one last question....\"\r\n\r\n\"What else do you wish to know?\" said Mr. Jackson.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder,\" answered my friend, \"what conclusions are to be drawn from\r\nthis enlightening conversation. You are undoubtedly against equal\r\nrights for the Jews. You would shut the doors of the country for the\r\nJews, wouldn't you? And you would limit the rights of those who\r\nalready live there, by establishing, let us say, something in the\r\nnature of a special zone outside of which they would not be allowed to\r\nsettle?\"\r\n\r\nEven as my friend was saying this the American's eyebrows went up,\r\nforming a sharp angle, and he looked at the speaker with such an air\r\nof pity that the latter was somewhat put out of countenance.\r\n\r\n\"How in the world have you reached such a conclusion?\" asked Jackson\r\ncoldly, and somewhat severely.\r\n\r\n\"But ... you dislike the Jews heartily....\"\r\n\r\nThe clanging of the gong was reaching our corner. Mr. Jackson rose\r\nand buttoning his coat, he said:\r\n\r\n\"It does not follow. You have made a bad syllogism: the conclusion\r\ndoes not follow from the premises.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, sir....\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true that I dislike those people, but it doesn't follow that I\r\nwant their rights restricted....\"\r\n\r\nAnd after a moment of deliberation, as though seeking for the clearest\r\nform of explanation, he went on.\r\n\r\n\"Here we are being called for dinner ... I must tell you, sir, that I\r\ncannot tolerate green peas. That is my personal taste. But it does not\r\nfollow by any means, gentlemen, that I have the right to demand that\r\ngreen peas should not be served.... Probably, others like the\r\ndish....\"\r\n\r\nAnd rising to his full height, he added:\r\n\r\n\"As for the rest of your words ... as an American, I would feel\r\ninsulted, if there were in my country citizens deprived of equal\r\nrights.... That a Kentuckian, for instance, should not have the right\r\nto breathe freely the air of Illinois.... My goodness.... The idea!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he started out, moving along the railing, straight and gaunt, and,\r\nthere was something peculiar in his entire figure. He seemed to feel\r\nhimself deeply insulted. At the door of the smoking-room, he met Mr.\r\nCarson of New York, his recent antagonist, and amiably taking his arm,\r\nhe started to tell him something in great excitement. Judging by the\r\nway Mr. Carson turned to look at us, it was evident that they were\r\ndiscussing us Russians, the gentlemen who draw false conclusions from\r\npremises.\r\n\r\nWe exchanged glances. Half a minute passed in perplexed silence. Then\r\nwe both laughed at once....\r\n\r\n\"_Rira bien qui rira le dernier._ We must confess that this time it is\r\n'our' rather bad American who laughs last,\" said my sarcastic friend.\r\n\"And did you notice the expression on his face at that moment?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it looked positively intelligent.... Probably, because the\r\nexperience and wisdom of a great nation, which has already firmly\r\nestablished axioms, were speaking at that moment through the mouth of\r\nour American....\"\r\n\r\n\"And the negroes?\" said my friend hesitatingly and thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Well, the negroes are 'the black peas' which Americans detest. But\r\nthat is a matter of social custom; the law, however, does not\r\ndistinguish them from other citizens.... To love, not to love ... that\r\nis elusive and capricious, but justice is obligatory, like an\r\naxiom....\"\r\n\r\nEntering the dining-room, I felt somewhat uneasy.... It seemed to me\r\nthat all the Americans would turn and eye us, the representatives of a\r\nnation which has not as yet learned the axioms of law, and which draws\r\nchildishly false conclusions from premises....\r\n\r\nBut I was mistaken. There was in the dining-room the usual rustling,\r\nclatter of plates, forks and knives, tinkling of glasses, and\r\nwhispered conversation. \"Our\" American was sitting at the side of his\r\nodd Dulcinea, and he again looked like a self-satisfied cox-comb. But,\r\nit seemed to me that into the everyday mood of the vessel's\r\ntable-d'hôte, there entered something elusive and significant, which\r\ncould change the appearance of this motley crowd just as our\r\nAmerican's face had changed at the end of our conversation.\r\n\r\nAnd, in fact, a few weeks later, I happened to be present at one of\r\nthose tempestuous manifestations of public opinion which at times\r\nbreak out like storms on the surface of the ocean. There is much that\r\nis ridiculous in the every-day tone of American newspapers, in their\r\nthirst for sensations and _réclame_, in their petty interviews. But\r\nhere everything was suddenly swept aside, and the dominant tone of the\r\nAmerican press became deep and significant. Now and then the voices of\r\npast generations,--the men who had been the builders of freedom and\r\nlaw in their country, the voices of Lincolns, Harrisons, and Davises\r\npierced the bustle of every-day life and were heard in editorials,\r\narticles, in the speeches delivered at meetings.\r\n\r\nThe occasion for all this was again the Jewish question, and the\r\nignorance of axioms shown by a nation of the old continent. And it\r\noccurred to me that probably somewhere in Chicago, Mr. Jackson, \"who\r\ndislikes green peas,\" was delivering, or at least listening to, a\r\nspeech about the axioms of human law, and was voting in favor of a\r\ncorresponding resolution.\r\n\r\nFor he firmly believes that love is capricious. Like mercy, it\r\nbloweth, whither it listeth.... But justice, justice is\r\nobligatory....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JEWISH QUESTION IN RUSSIA\r\n\r\n\r\n   _Professor Paul Nikolayevich Milyukov, the central figure in the\r\n   present Russian revolution, was born in 1859. Before the upheaval\r\n   in 1905 he was known as a distinguished historian. In 1903 and\r\n   1904 he lectured on Russia at Harvard and at the University of\r\n   Chicago, and in 1908 he spoke on the situation in Russia before\r\n   the Civic Forum in Carnegie Hall. Ever since the revolutionary\r\n   days of 1905-6, Professor Milyukov has been playing a most\r\n   conspicuous part in the Russian emancipatory movement, as the\r\n   leader of the Constitutional party, as a Duma deputy and the\r\n   editor of the influential radical newspaper Ryech._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JEWISH QUESTION IN RUSSIA\r\n\r\nBY P. MILYUKOV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Jewish question in Russia presents altogether peculiar aspects.\r\nThis is not only because there are in the Empire six million Jews,\r\ni.e., more than in any other State in the world, and because in the\r\nprovinces annexed at the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of\r\nthe nineteenth centuries, they form as much as 11 per cent. of the\r\npopulation--but also for the reason that the legal status of the\r\nRussian Jews completely differs from that of other non-Russian\r\nnationalities which go to make the Empire. These nationalities\r\nendeavour to obtain the many rights of which they are deprived. The\r\nmost important of these rights is national autonomy, i.e., the right\r\nof a collective unit to preserve and develop its national\r\nindividuality. In this manner they desire to protect themselves from\r\nthe danger of assimilation, from the possibility of their fusion with\r\nthe dominant nationality. Of course the Jews, too, have been striving,\r\nespecially in late years, to realise national autonomy and thus\r\nsafeguard the rights and aspirations of their collective unit. But\r\nthey lack still other rights. They have still to be granted those\r\nrights which to a considerable degree other Russian subjects, not of\r\nRussian birth, enjoy. The law does not protect the elementary civil\r\nrights of the Jews as members of our common Russian commonwealth.\r\nConsequently, that which the Jews strive for is far more elementary,\r\nfar more primitive and simple, than the objective of other non-Russian\r\nnationalities which inhabit Russia.\r\n\r\nAnti-Semitism is not peculiar to Russia; it is to be found in other\r\ncountries as well. But there it exists as an emotion and a state of\r\nmind, not as a system of legislative definitions. The time has long\r\nsince passed when the legislatures of the world failed to guarantee\r\nthe elementary civil rights of the Jews. Roumania alone constitutes a\r\npeculiar exception. But, as a rule, in all civilised States the law\r\nguarantees Jewish rights, and religious and racial differences do not\r\ncreate legal disabilities. Nevertheless, if anti-Semitism is still in\r\nexistence in the Western countries, the aims it pursues there are\r\npolitical. It continues to be the weapon of political reaction. And\r\nits objective, at its extreme, is by no means like the grandiose\r\nprogramme of utter destruction of the Jews which is pursued by the\r\n\"truly-Russian\" theoreticians of our reaction.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the Jewish question in Russia means, above all, the\r\nlegal disabilities of the individual Jews that result from the\r\ndiscriminations made against them as a religious and national entity.\r\nIt is only one aspect of our general inequality and of our lack of\r\ncivil freedom. The problem of Jewish equal rights in Russia is the\r\nproblem of the equal rights of all our citizens in general. That is\r\nwhy the anti-Semitical parties in Russia have a larger political\r\nsignificance and importance than the anti-Semitical parties of the\r\nWest. In our country they almost coincide with anti-constitutional\r\nparties, in general, and anti-Semitism is the banner of the old\r\nrégime, of which we still struggle in vain to rid ourselves. This\r\naccounts for the fact that the Jewish question occupies such a\r\nprominent place in Russian social and political life. Here the\r\nstruggle for general rights coincides with the struggle for national\r\nrights. That is why the Jewish problem has come to occupy the centre\r\nof our political stage.\r\n\r\nI must add that Russian anti-Semitism, as defined above, is a\r\ncomparatively new phenomenon, in fact, it may be asserted that it is a\r\nphenomenon of most recent origin. However ancient may be the instincts\r\non which our anti-Semites try to play, anti-Semitism itself as a\r\npolitical motto, as a movement with a party platform and definite\r\naims, is a new means of political struggle, invented and applied only\r\nin late years. Of course, in the past there can be found\r\nmanifestations--very crude and coarse--of what might be termed\r\n\"zoological\" anti-Semitism. In 1563, Ivan the Terrible conquered\r\nPolotzk, and for the first time the Russian Government was confronted\r\nby the fact of the existence of the Jewish nationality. The Czar's\r\nadvisers were somewhat perplexed and asked him what to do with these\r\nnewly acquired subjects. Ivan the Terrible answered unhesitatingly:\r\n\"Baptise them or drown them in the river.\"\r\n\r\nThey were drowned. And the old Russian \"zoological\" nationalism was\r\nsatisfied by this primitive solution of the problem. But the political\r\nwisdom of Czar Ivan's times has long since become obsolete.\r\n\r\nA century later Russian statehood for the second time ran across the\r\nJewish problem when Smolensk was taken by Czar Alexyey Mikhaylovich\r\nthe Debonnaire, also an old Russian nationalist who was not conscious\r\nof his nationalism. He could not make up his mind to settle it by\r\nsimply destroying the object which perplexed Russia's political mind.\r\nAfter due deliberation, he decided to have the Jews deported. This was\r\na somewhat milder measure. Another century passed, and Russia\r\nconquered the vast and rich territory which is included in the\r\nso-called \"Pale of Settlement.\" This portion of Russia was peopled\r\nwith many millions of Jews. It was not possible any longer to do away\r\nwith this large population by either drowning it in a river, or\r\neven--as many are still planning in all earnestness--by deportation.\r\nThus, the Russian state, in the person of Empress Catherine II, for\r\nthe first time found itself forced to face the Jewish question in a\r\nform which did not allow of simply waving it aside. How then did the\r\nenlightened Empress settle it? Well, she simply did not put the\r\nquestion. Her decision was nearly this: The Jews have lived there--let\r\nthem stay there; they had certain rights relating to their faith and\r\nproperty--let them enjoy these rights in the future. The\r\nInterpretation of the Senate even more strongly emphasised this\r\nthought. Here is the gist of this Interpretation: \"Since the Imperial\r\nUkase has placed the Jews in a legal status of equality with the rest\r\nof the population, the rule established by her Majesty should,\r\ntherefore, be followed in application to each particular case. Every\r\none should enjoy his rights and acquisitions according to his\r\ncondition and calling without distinction of faith and nationality.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the decision of the Senate of the time of Catherine the\r\nGreat. There can be no question here of a negative solution of the\r\nJewish problem, for the very possibility of such a problem was not\r\nconsidered. Least of all did Catherine think that in the lapse of\r\nyears her ukase of December 23, 1791, in which neither faith nor\r\nnationality was mentioned, would give birth to ... the \"Pale of\r\nSettlement.\" At that time the Jews were confined within the limits of\r\nthe \"Pale\" neither more nor less than the Ukrainian population of that\r\nsection, or the people of the old Russian provinces were. It will be\r\nremembered that in those times the law forbade a townsman to take up\r\nhis residence in another town or in a village. It was not a special\r\nlimitation intended for the Jews, it affected all the Russian subjects\r\nthroughout the Empire. How then did it result in a special Jewish\r\ndisability?\r\n\r\nIt did not result either from the increase in the rights of other\r\ncitizens, or from the limitation of the rights of the Jews as a\r\nnationality. The afore-mentioned limitations were removed from the\r\ntownspeople of non-Jewish birth both in the newly annexed provinces\r\nand elsewhere. But they remained in full force in relation to the\r\nJews, living in towns. But since all the Jews were registered as\r\ntownspeople, this restriction coincided with the limits of their\r\nnationality. Hence arose the \"Pale\" which assumed the character of a\r\nnational disability. Thus, the problem of Jewish disabilities was\r\npractically solved before the legislator ever formulated the Jewish\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, in the times of Catherine II, when the main features\r\nof the future Jewish disabilities were becoming a fact, the Government\r\ndid not solve the general Jewish question in principle. Likewise,\r\nduring the entire century which followed Catherine's reign, that is,\r\nall through the nineteenth century, our legislation was in a state of\r\nconstant indecision.\r\n\r\nA brief historical survey will show plainly the accuracy of this\r\nstatement. In 1795 the Jews who lived in the villages of the Province\r\nof Minsk were ordered to move to the towns. In the following year they\r\nwere permitted to stay in the villages, because the landed proprietors\r\nemployed them as agents for the sale of whiskey. In the year 1801 a\r\nnew edict again expels the Jews from the villages. In 1802 the Senate\r\nrules that they must stay in their former places of residence. In\r\n1804--the year that saw the first Regulation concerning the Jews--they\r\nare ordered to be expelled within three years from the villages\r\nthroughout the country. But in 1808 before the term expires the law is\r\nfound impracticable. The Jews again remained where they had been\r\nestablished, their status being subject to further regulation. Then\r\nthe Committee of the year 1812 came to the conclusion that the law of\r\n1804 must be completely abrogated, in view of its being unjust and\r\ndangerous. Between 1812 and 1827 the mood of the legislation is again\r\naltered and prohibitive measures follow one another. In 1835, these\r\nmeasures are once more found to be useless and inefficient. In 1852,\r\nexpulsions are renewed, but a few years later, with the beginning of\r\nthe liberal reign of Alexander II, this policy is again abandoned and\r\nan interval of rest and quiet, covering a quarter of a century, is\r\ninaugurated. Then the temporary Regulations of 1882 undertake to\r\nprohibit new Jewish settlements outside of towns. Former settlements,\r\nalthough illegal, were legalised and exempted from persecution. But in\r\n1893 all the Jews who had illegally settled in the villages were again\r\nordered to be expelled therefrom. Nevertheless, the committee of the\r\nyear 1899 not only refused to ratify this measure, but, on the\r\ncontrary, it recognised the necessity of relaxing even the old\r\nTemporary Regulation of 1882. And, in fact, in 1903 we find the Jewish\r\nsettlements in 158 villages. At the same time, the Jewish rural\r\npopulation within the limits of the \"Pale of Settlement\" grew\r\nconsiderably. In 1881 there lived in the villages 580,000 Jews; in the\r\nyear 1897 they reached the number of 711,000.\r\n\r\nThus did our legislation concerning the Jews fluctuate and vacillate.\r\nAnd amidst these hesitations the thought of a complete removal of all\r\nthe Jewish disabilities never died. Here is another historical\r\nexcursion covering a century. The Committee of Jewish Affairs of the\r\nyear 1803 plainly established this regulation: \"the maximum of freedom\r\nand the minimum of limitations.\" The second Committee, whose\r\nactivities fall in the period from 1807 to 1812, proved even more\r\nthoroughgoing, for it was more familiar with the conditions of Russian\r\nlife. It asserted that the Jews are useful and necessary for the\r\nRussian village. It added, furthermore, that the negative, dark\r\nphenomena which are attributed by some to the presence of Jews in the\r\nvillages, in reality are characteristic of Russian life in general,\r\nand cannot be said to be due to the Jewish influence. This was also\r\nthe opinion of the minority of the Imperial Council in 1835. In 1858,\r\nthe Minister of the Interior himself demanded equal rights for the\r\nJews, and the reactionary Committee on Jewish affairs agreed to the\r\ndemand on the sole condition that the disabilities should be removed\r\ngradually, from various Jewish groups. The new Committee of 1872 acted\r\neven more vigorously. It believed that the abolition of Jewish\r\ndisabilities is, in general, nothing but an act of justice, and that\r\nthis abolition must be carried out not gradually, but immediately i.e.\r\nit must include all the groups of the Jewish population. Again, the\r\nCommittee of 1883 comes to the same conclusion that it is necessary to\r\ngive the Jews equal rights. That was the opinion even of Von Pleve,\r\nwho is known to the world for his persecution of the Jews. In the\r\nperiod from 1905 to 1907 the revision of the legislation concerning\r\nthe Jews for the purpose of abolishing the prohibitive measures was\r\nconsidered but a question of time and was left to the consideration\r\nof the people's representatives in the Imperial Duma which had just\r\ncome into being. The opinion of the first two sessions of the Duma is\r\nwell known. The People's representatives in the first two Dumas\r\nannounced directly and unambiguously that the realisation of full\r\ncivic freedom, for Jews as well as for the rest of the citizens, was\r\none of their first tasks. Then a new reactionary election law was\r\nintroduced. It made a radical change in the composition of the\r\nImperial Duma and also in the attitude of the latter toward the Jewish\r\nquestion. The outright usefulness of the part played by the Jews in\r\nthe economic life of both town and village,--this fact, which even\r\nreactionary governments, ministers and committees ceased doubting, was\r\nagain questioned by the newly elected representatives of the Russian\r\npeople. It is only from that moment on that it became possible to plan\r\nsuch measures as the abolition of those meagre rights which the Jews\r\nare still enjoying. Thus, together with the victory of political\r\nreaction the new anti-Semitism, which we cannot any longer overlook,\r\nhas become triumphant.\r\n\r\nOur historical excursion enables us also to explain the reason why in\r\nthe present phrase of Russian social life the Jewish problem has again\r\narisen in an unprecedented form. It was simply a new political weapon,\r\nin a sense, the result of the new form of political life. As long as\r\nthe nation was voiceless, as long as all matters were decided by the\r\nbureaucracy in the quiet of offices, committees, and ministries, it\r\nwas possible for the Government to ignore the people as a factor in\r\nlegislation, and to take into account nothing but the needs and the\r\nwelfare of the state as it understood them. But when the nation was\r\ncalled to participate in state affairs, there arose the need of\r\ninfluencing it in a certain sense. It became necessary to work up the\r\nmasses, to act on their intellect and will. Official anti-Semitism is\r\nthe most primitive means of satisfying this need, a simplified attempt\r\nto bridle the masses, to suggest to them the feelings, motives, views\r\nand methods which are in the interest of those who play the game. In\r\nother words, demagogy came into being. For the purposes of demagogy a\r\nspecial political weapon, corresponding to the political conditions\r\nunder the new régime, was created,--namely artificial political\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nThus, anti-Semitism of the new type, however strange this conclusion\r\nmay appear, is the product of the constitutional epoch. It is a\r\nresponse to the need for new means of influencing the masses. And in\r\nthis sense anti-Semitism plays in Russia the same rôle as it played in\r\nWestern Europe.\r\n\r\nBismarck, it will be remembered, called anti-Semitism the socialism of\r\nfools. In order to combat the socialism of intelligent people, it is\r\nnecessary to take hold of the ignorant masses and to mislead them by\r\nshowing them the imaginary enemy of their welfare instead of the real\r\none. Anti-Semitism says to the ignorant masses: \"There is your enemy,\r\nfight the Jews, and you will improve your life conditions....\" It is\r\nwell known that such attempts to apply anti-Semitism for the purpose\r\nof creating social parties of the new type were more than once made in\r\nthe West. As an example, I shall cite the Christian Social Party in\r\nAustria, with its late leader, Lueger.\r\n\r\nThere is one small difference between us and the West. In Russia the\r\nmasses are not so well prepared to appreciate a social argument, even\r\nwhen served in a simplified form. In Russia anti-Semitism is forced to\r\npresent this argument in an even more popular form, making an appeal\r\nto the most elementary passions and instincts. F.I. Rodichev once\r\nremarked in the Duma, parodying Bismarck's aphorism to fit it to our\r\nconditions, that anti-Semitism is \"the patriotism of perplexed\r\npeople.\" In fact, anti-Semitism in Russia is a means of creating a\r\nnationalism of a definite type in the masses, it is with this aim in\r\nview that our anti-Semites play on the racial and religious\r\nanimosities of the masses.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this difference, the very means, ways, and methods our\r\nanti-Semites use in their striving to mould the popular mind are of\r\ndistinctly foreign origin. It is enough to collate the arguments\r\nexpounded in the Duma or printed in the _Russian Standard_ and\r\n_Zemshchina_ with the anti-Semitic literature of the West, such as\r\nDrumont's books, or similar German works,--and it becomes apparent\r\nthat in the latter the entire anti-Semitic arsenal of our nationalists\r\nis to be found ready-made. It is from thence that mediæval legends of\r\nritual murders and law projects concerning the slaughter of cattle,\r\nand such-like inventions, are imported to us.\r\n\r\nAnti-Semitism serves in Russia one more purpose. It is not sufficient\r\nto influence the masses. It is also necessary to act on the powers\r\nthat be. If it is imperative to get hold of the masses, it is also\r\nnecessary to frighten the authorities. Thus a new version of the\r\nanti-Semitic legend comes into being: the legend of the Jew as the\r\ncreator of the Russian revolution. It is the Jew,--so our anti-Semites\r\nassure us--who created the Russian emancipatory movements, it is he\r\nwho formed the revolutionary organisation, it is he who marched under\r\nthe red banners.... The Russian who would give credence to this tale\r\nwould show his disrespect for the Russian nation. To assert that it is\r\nonly owing to the help of the Jew that the Russian people freed\r\nthemselves is tantamount to saying that without the Jew, the Russian\r\nnation can not reach the road of its own emancipation. No, however\r\ngreat my respect for the exceptional gifts of the Jewish people may\r\nbe, I will not refuse the Russian nation the ability of taking the\r\ninitiative in the cause of its own freedom.\r\n\r\nBut there is another side to this matter. If there can be no question\r\nof the dependence of the emancipation movement on the Jews, the\r\ndependence of the Jews on the emancipatory movement is very real. What\r\nmust be the Jew's attitude toward this movement? There can be only one\r\nanswer to the question. The Jewish masses have realised the importance\r\nfor them of the emancipatory movement not only because they are more\r\nenlightened, because they are more educated, because they are not\r\naddicted to alcoholism, and, hence, are superior to their neighbours\r\nin their understanding of their own needs; the Jewish masses were also\r\nled to side with the movement for freedom because in their case it was\r\na struggle for elementary rights the importance of which is plain to\r\nevery one and vitally concerns every one. That is why the entire\r\nJewish mass may actually be reckoned in the ranks of those who are\r\nwith the Russian emancipatory movement.\r\n\r\nOne more remark in conclusion. In late years the \"inorodtzy\" (Russian\r\nsubjects of non-Russian birth), having lost their hope that the\r\nRussian emancipatory movement would bring them any immediate practical\r\nresults, have sought to influence the Government by means of more\r\ndirect methods. There are national movements which believe that they\r\nwould more rapidly get national rights by means of negotiating with\r\nthe bureaucracy. They are inclined to think that this way is more\r\ndirect than the participation in the Russian emancipatory movement.\r\nOther national groups, in the struggle for their national rights,\r\nchoose a different kind of tactics: they seek a more direct way in\r\nanother direction,--not through the bureaucracy, not from above, but\r\nfrom below. They, too, believe that the \"inorodtzy\" must organise for\r\ntheir specific national aims and keep apart from the common cause of\r\nRussia's political emancipation.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said about the peculiar nature of the Jewish\r\nquestion which results in the sufferings of the Jews not only as a\r\nnational group, but also as individual citizens, it follows that it is\r\ndifficult for the Jews more than for any other group of \"inorodtzy\" to\r\naccept either one of the aforenamed tactical methods. The Jews must\r\nbear in mind with especial clearness that their fate is closely and\r\ninseparably interwoven with the fate of the general emancipatory\r\nmovement in Russia. They must also keep in mind that the separate\r\nnational movements which disrupt the bonds of political parties in\r\norder to make place for their national programmes, may prove injurious\r\nto our common cause. They may lead us away from the common highroad to\r\nby-paths where we all run the risk of going apart and losing our way.\r\nAnd here is the practical conclusion to which these considerations\r\nlead. The separate national movements should be postponed until the\r\nsolution of the general problem of all-Russian emancipation. Let us\r\nhope that the Jewish nation understands the close connection existing\r\nbetween its fate and that of Russia's freedom, now, as well as it did\r\nin those years when it fought in the ranks of the Russian progressive\r\nmovements. Let us hope that in the future, as in the past, the\r\nemancipation of the different nationalities which people the Russian\r\nEmpire will be fought for in the common ranks of the all-Russian\r\nmovement for freedom.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JEWS AND RUSSIAN ECONOMIC LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\n   _Mikhail Vladimirovich Bernatzky, born in 1878, is a noted writer\r\n   on economical topics. He taught economics at the Kiev University\r\n   and at the Polytechnical Institute, Petrograd._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JEWS AND RUSSIAN ECONOMIC LIFE\r\n\r\nBY M. BERNATZKY\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch has been written about the insufferable situation of the Russian\r\nJews, these serfs of the twentieth century, chained to \"the Pale of\r\nSettlement,\" somewhat like the Roman colons, _\"glebae adscripti_.\" The\r\ntragic history of late years and the epoch through which we are living\r\ncan disturb the inner composure of the most indifferent spectator of\r\ncurrent events. It is painful to touch upon many aching and\r\nessentially clear questions, but life constantly and severely demands\r\nthat they should be brought before our minds, and life awaits an\r\nanswer to them from the thought and conscience of Russian society.\r\n\r\nIt is not our intention to discuss the necessity for the removal of\r\nJewish disabilities from the humanitarian standpoint. However\r\nmajestic may be those \"elementary principles of law and morality,\"\r\nwhich have been achieved by mankind on its long historic road and\r\nwhich are now the very basis of civilisation, in the eyes of many they\r\nare still little more than \"fine words,\" stylistic embellishments of\r\nhighbrow talk. Of course, the atmosphere of discriminations is equally\r\npernicious for those who suffer and those who are privileged: did not\r\nserfdom corrupt the master as well as the slave? All this is eminently\r\ntrue. But there are arguments, which we regret to say, are more\r\nappealing and convincing. It is these arguments that we shall treat in\r\nthe present paper.\r\n\r\nThe reader is well aware of the fact that in these days nothing has\r\nbeen discussed more vividly than the necessity of developing Russia's\r\nproductive powers. The intimate connection between the general\r\nprosperity of our country and its economic progress has penetrated\r\ninto the consciousness of people at large. It is the war, evidently,\r\nthat has driven this truth home to us: namely that the ultimate\r\nsuccess of the conflict depends not only on the activity of the\r\narmies, but also on the economic stability of the belligerent\r\nnations. The economic difficulties which are being experienced by\r\nGermany, strengthen our faith in our final victory. More than a\r\nquarter of a century ago the Russian Minister of Finance, who took\r\ngreat pains to develop our industry, wrote in the explanatory memoir\r\nwhich accompanied the project of the state budget:\r\n\r\n\"I believe it to be the duty I owe Your Imperial Majesty to express my\r\nfirm, clear, and profound conviction that economic prosperity of the\r\npeople even when coupled with a somewhat imperfect military\r\norganisation will be more useful in case of war than the most complete\r\nmilitary preparedness combined with economic weakness. In the latter\r\ncase, the people, however eager they may be to sacrifice both their\r\nlife and property, can bring to the altar of the fatherland their life\r\nonly, but they will be unable to furnish the necessary financial means\r\nfor the State.\"\r\n\r\nIt is from this standpoint of economic interests that we shall\r\napproach the painful Jewish question. The time is long since past when\r\nit was possible to say with the Empress Elizabeth Petrovna: \"From\r\nChrist's enemies I desire no profit.\" It is precisely in this profit\r\nthat both the Exchequer and the higher classes, and--what is most\r\nimportant--the people at large, are greatly interested. The basic\r\nproductive force of a country is the living work of its population.\r\nThe body politic of Russia contains about six millions of gifted and\r\nundoubtedly industrious Jews. The manner in which the forces of this\r\npeople are applied will be treated further on. For the moment let us\r\nstate this: it is to the interest of the Russian State to utilise\r\neconomically this living Jewish energy as completely and rationally as\r\npossible. From this standpoint all the obstacles which are created for\r\nthe Jews in the field of education are absolutely incomprehensible: it\r\nis as if our country, sorely lacking as it is not only in\r\nrepresentatives of superior qualified labour, but actually in literate\r\npeople, were striving to increase its ignorance and intellectual\r\nbackwardness. Of course, formal justification can be found for every\r\nact, and every evil-doer endeavours to convince himself of the justice\r\nof his evil deeds. So it is in this case, too: the intentional\r\nshutting-off of the Jewish masses from education is motivated by the\r\ndesire to keep them from becoming superior to the Russian population,\r\nwhich, it is said, is intellectually inferior to the Jews. This\r\nargument is an outright insult flung in the face of the Russian\r\npeople. It shows that the official guardians of the nation do not know\r\nits rich natural powers. But this argument cannot obscure the\r\nessential nature of Jewish disabilities as an intentional neglect of\r\nthat productive power which is represented by a portion of the Russian\r\nsubjects. Our economic organism does not get all the benefits to which\r\nit may rightfully lay claim.\r\n\r\nLet us turn to those characteristic social and economic conditions\r\nunder which the Jews exist in our country. Nearly all of them, upward\r\nof five millions, live within the Pale of Settlement, which comprises\r\nfifteen governments and Poland, and only six per cent. live outside of\r\nthis territory. Within the Pale, Jews are not allowed to buy or take\r\non lease real estate outside the towns and townlets, which\r\ncircumstance makes it impossible for them to become farmers. This, in\r\nconnection with the limitation of residence, has naturally resulted in\r\na peculiar character of the Jewish occupations. It is characteristic\r\nof the part the Jews play in Russia's economic life that nearly\r\nseventy-three and eight hundredths per cent. of them are forced to\r\nseek employment in the country's commerce and industry. Of the entire\r\nJewish population throughout the Empire, only two and four tenths per\r\ncent. are engaged in agriculture, four and seven tenths per cent. in\r\nliberal professions, eleven and five tenths per cent. in personal\r\nservice (domestic service etc.); the rest, minus the persons without\r\nany definite employment are forced to seek for means of livelihood in\r\nthe field of commerce (thirty-one per cent.), industry (thirty-six and\r\nthree tenths per cent.), and transport (three per cent.) In the same\r\nway works the artificial congestion of the Jews in the cities: only\r\neighteen per cent. live in the villages of the Pale of Settlement,\r\nwhile the rest--more than four-fifths--toil in the towns and townlets.\r\nSuch a one-sided distribution of Jewish labour would not be a negative\r\nphenomenon if it were possible to spread it uniformly over the entire\r\ncountry. For, backward as Russia is industrially and commercially, the\r\nJews would easily find a place in the fields of endeavour which suit\r\nthem best and would greatly benefit the country by furthering the\r\nprocess of its industrialisation. Under present circumstances they are\r\ncrowded in one place and overburden the commerce and the industry of\r\nthe Pale of Settlement. As a result, the struggle for existence among\r\nthem is so keen and desperate that in some sections they are\r\nundoubtedly on the way to degeneration. In the West, Galicia and\r\nRoumania excluded, the Jews are well represented in the wealthy\r\nclasses; in Russia an overwhelming portion of them are proletaries,\r\n\"free like birds,\" poverty-stricken people who literally do not know\r\nto-day by what they are going to live to-morrow. Heart-rending\r\npictures are painted by impartial observers of the life of the Jewish\r\npoorer classes, of all these tradesmen, factory workers, petty\r\nmerchants and peddlers. They literally starve and cripple both mind\r\nand body in the slums of cities and towns. The natural result is that\r\nin their eager search for means of livelihood they are forced to have\r\nrecourse to all sorts of expedients. Hence, all this talk about the\r\n\"criminal features\" of the Jewish character and their propensity for\r\nfinancial speculation, which propensity is, however, easily forgiven\r\nand even encouraged in the \"true-Russian\" representatives of our\r\ncommercial interests. On the other hand, the Jews lower \"the standards\r\nof living\" by offering their services often at a very low price. Thus\r\na peculiar \"social anti-Semitism\" comes into being, in Russia as well\r\nas in the countries of Jewish immigration,--a phenomenon not unlike\r\nthe movement against \"yellow labour\" in the United States and in the\r\nAustralian Federation. There can be no doubt that the artificially\r\nrestrained field of application of Jewish labour is alone responsible\r\nfor the unspeakable condition in which it is forced to exist. In spite\r\nof the exodus of a large mass of Jews from Russia, which bears analogy\r\nto the emigration of the Irish people from their native\r\ncountry,--upward of one and a half million Jews left Russia between\r\nthe years 1881 and 1908,--the remaining millions seem to be doomed to\r\nstarvation and degeneration. The popular tales about Jewish wealth are\r\nmost emphatically contradicted by impartial facts. Of the emigrants\r\nwho reach the shores of America the Jews are the poorest. A Scotch\r\nemigrant coming to the United States brings on the average $41.50, an\r\nEnglishman $38.70, a Frenchman $37.80, a German $28.50, while a Jew\r\nbrings the sum of $8.70, the smallest of all, far below the general\r\naverage, which is $15.00. Consequently, if any real danger at all\r\nthreatens the aboriginal Russian population, it is precisely the cheap\r\nlabour of the congested Jewish masses, and the more the Jews will be\r\noppressed the worse it will be for the Russian workman! For the\r\nemployer will always give preference to cheaper labour. It is evident,\r\ntherefore, that the present treatment of the Jews is really not\r\ndictated by the native Russian population, and that the democratic\r\nargument is but a false pretext. The Russian labour market, while\r\ncongested in the Pale, is scarce in other sections. That the economic\r\nlife of Russia, as a whole, suffers from it is obvious.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, another point is worthy of our attention.\r\nContrary, to the popular idea of the Jewish greed, the Jews are\r\nusually satisfied with a lower rate of interest on the capital\r\ninvested, since what they are after is the bare means of livelihood.\r\nIn this fashion they lower, to a considerable extent, the capitalist's\r\nprofits, a circumstance which cannot fail to irritate the Gentile\r\ncapitalists. Consequently, all this comes to competition of capital,\r\nand it is significant that the fiercest anti-Semitic outcries come\r\nfrom the capitalistic classes. Let us not forget that the early\r\npogroms at Odessa were caused by the agitation of the Greek merchants\r\nwho feared for their commercial ascendency.\r\n\r\nWhat has been said so far demonstrates with sufficient clearness that\r\nthe anti-Semitic economic policy is detrimental to the economic\r\norganism of Russia as a whole. The true interests of our country\r\ndemand that Jewish labour and Jewish means should be given complete\r\nfreedom of application. Russia will only gain from such a change of\r\npolicy toward the Jews. Anti-Semitism, from the economic standpoint,\r\nis nothing but a tremendous waste of the country's productive powers.\r\n\r\nHere is another aspect of the question. Whether the Jews as a race are\r\nto one's liking or not, is a question of individual taste, the\r\nsolution of which cannot be allowed to influence the sane economic\r\npolicy of a state. This must be guided by objective data. As a matter\r\nof fact, the Jews constitute more than one third, thirty-five per\r\ncent., of the commercial class in Russia. If we believe our country's\r\nprosperity to be bound up with the process of its progressive\r\nindustrialisation, we must admit that the part the Jews play in\r\nRussia's commercial life is tremendous, that to a considerable degree\r\nthey handle her entire commerce. All that hinders the untrammelled\r\nmanifestation of the Jewish economic energies is harmful to Russia's\r\neconomic organism.\r\n\r\n\"If there were no Jews now in Russia, it would be necessary to invite\r\nthem, in the interests of both the commercial and industrial\r\ndevelopment of the country, just as they were more than once invited\r\nfor the same purposes in the past.\" This conclusion, reached by a\r\nstudent of the Jewish question in Russia, is eminently and profoundly\r\ntrue. The opinion of an individual student may not appear\r\nauthoritative, but it has been many a time endorsed by social groups\r\nand organisations. We need not go far back into history to find facts\r\nof this sort. In 1912 at the time when the customary fair was in full\r\nswing, the Governor of Nizhni-Novgorod showed an unusual zeal in\r\npersecuting the Jews. This was in all probability connected with the\r\nDuma pre-election campaign. The \"Society of the Manufacturers and Mill\r\nOwners of the Moscow Industrial Section,\" an organisation which is\r\nrather far from being liberal in its opinions, saw fit to interfere in\r\nits own interests. A memoir dealing with the prohibitive measures\r\ndirected against the Jews was composed and presented, through the\r\npresident of the Society, Mr. Goujon, to the chairman of the Council\r\nof the Ministers. Here is a quotation from this memoir: \"In the\r\neconomic life of the country the Jews play the part of middlemen,\r\nplaced between the producer and the consumer of goods. In the\r\nNorthwestern, Southern, and Southwestern provinces this function is\r\nalmost exclusively that of the Jews. To isolate under such conditions,\r\nthe commercial and industrial population of a considerable section of\r\nthe country from the centre of its manufacturing districts is\r\nequivalent to inflicting a tremendous loss not only on the Jewish\r\nmerchant class but also on the many millions of the non-Jewish\r\npopulation.... To isolate the village from the town, the towns of the\r\nWest and South from the towns and villages of the Centre and the East,\r\nis to disturb intentionally the economic life of the country, to\r\nundermine credit and depreciate the people's labour.\"\r\n\r\nThat is the opinion of the Moscow manufacturers. Well aware of the\r\nreal needs of the country, and unwilling to sacrifice their commercial\r\ninterests to anti-humanitarian mottoes, they expressed their fear that\r\nthe actions of the administration would hinder the realisation of the\r\nharvest and that the \"stocks of goods would find neither consumers nor\r\nbuyers nor energetic middlemen to the extent to which they otherwise\r\nwould have.\"\r\n\r\nThe Jewish people has grown to be a living part of Russia's economic\r\norganism, and the blows which are directed against the Jews affect in\r\nan equal, if not a greater, degree the mass of the aboriginal Russian\r\npopulation. We do not intend to discuss here the Zionistic dreams and\r\naspirations of the Jews. One thing is clear to us, namely, that a\r\ncomplete exodus of the Jews from Russia would be greatly detrimental\r\nto her economic development. The Western world understands this truth\r\nvery well. Werner Sombart in his work _Die Zukunft der Juden_ (The\r\nFuture of the Jews) reaches the following conclusion: \"If by a miracle\r\nall the Jews would decide to-morrow to emigrate to Palestine we (the\r\nGermans) would never allow them to. For it would mean a catastrophe in\r\nthe field of economic relation, not to speak of other fields, such as\r\nwe have never as yet experienced and which would probably cripple our\r\neconomic organism forever.\"\r\n\r\nBut we, Russians, give little thought to such questions. As late as\r\nthe year 1914 we did not hesitate to inaugurate new restrictive\r\nmeasures, which it took the great trial of this War to stop.\r\n\r\nWhoever has our economic welfare at heart, whoever dreams about the\r\nmighty development of our country and of its real emancipation from\r\nforeign influence,--inasmuch as this is generally possible,--must\r\nunderstand that anti-Semitism is the worst foe of our economic\r\nprosperity, that, in short, the Jewish question is a Russian\r\nquestion. Full rights for the Jews, equal with those that the rest of\r\nthe population of the Empire enjoy, are an indispensable condition for\r\nour peaceful cultural development. Only on that basis can we achieve\r\nthe broad ideals which have come into prominence in this tragic\r\nstruggle with German imperialism.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WAR AND THE STATUS OF THE JEW\r\n\r\n\r\n   _Prince Paul Dmitriyevich Dolgorukov, a prominent leader of the\r\n   emancipatory movement in Russia, was born in 1866. He is one of\r\n   the founders of the Constitutional Democratic party, and for a\r\n   while he stood at the head of the Central Committee of this\r\n   party. He was a member of the Second Duma, where he represented\r\n   the city of Moscow._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WAR AND THE STATUS OF THE JEW\r\n\r\nBY PRINCE PAUL DOLGORUKOV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe storm that has recently swept over our country brought to light a\r\nseries of conditions which have been weighing down upon the Russian\r\nnation for a good many years. These conditions on account of their\r\nlong duration have come to be considered as something habitual. The\r\nimpossibility of their further continuance, at least in their present\r\nform, has suddenly become quite apparent.\r\n\r\nThe first among these is the existing attitude toward peoples whose\r\nfate is closely interwoven with the fate of Russia. The need for a new\r\npolicy toward the Poles has been recognised officially and solemnly.\r\nThe hour for settling the Jewish question has also struck. The\r\ncontrast between the duties and responsibilities of the Jew toward the\r\nstate and his position in the country where he is deprived of all\r\nrights and privileges has always existed; during the war this\r\ncontradiction has become so pronounced that it is impossible to\r\noverlook it any longer.\r\n\r\nHundreds of thousands of Jews are shedding their blood for Russia,\r\nwhile at home they are deprived of such elementary rights as other\r\nRussian subjects could lose only when convicted of crime. When a\r\npopulation of six million occupies such a position, the fact is bound\r\nto make itself felt in all walks of life; but what the war has made\r\nsupremely clear is the limitations to which the Jew is subjected as to\r\nhis right to choose freely his place of residence and to give his\r\nchildren an education.\r\n\r\nThe so-called \"Pale of Settlement,\" Poland and the southwestern\r\nsection, constituted the arena for the early operations of the war.\r\nThe tradesmen, the merchants, all people of any means were ruined; the\r\npoor workman was left without a crust of bread. The invading foe\r\nforced both these groups to flee. Where were they to flee? The\r\nsimplest solution that presented itself was for them to go into other\r\ncities of the \"Pale.\" But the burden of the war was felt there also.\r\nThe chief bread-winner of the family had gone to war; both industries\r\nand trades were crippled. Emigration, the safety valve of poverty, was\r\nnow impossible. Into the midst of this suffering came pouring in the\r\nrefugees from the border regions, on the one hand, and on the other,\r\nthe exiles from Germany and Austria, where they had previously found\r\nfood and shelter, and whence they had now, so to speak, been thrown\r\noverboard.\r\n\r\nThe economic rôle of such an element, hungry and unemployed, is easily\r\nappraised. Small wonder, then, that such a condition should become\r\nabsolutely unbearable; starvation has become a common occurrence, and\r\nmany prefer suicide to asking for alms. And should some of these care\r\nto ask for aid there is no one who could offer it, since the local\r\npopulation cannot cope with the need that has so suddenly swooped down\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\nRussia is a vast country, as is the soul of the Russian. Enough land\r\nand bread exists for all its children. Many have relatives who would\r\nwelcome the refugees and exiles into their homes for the time being;\r\nmany could earn their livelihood. But in accordance with the existing\r\nregulations the authorities must observe that no one who has not the\r\nright of residence should come without the \"Pale.\" The absurdity of\r\nsuch regulations becomes more apparent when applied to participants in\r\nthe war. Thousands of wounded Jewish soldiers are scattered all over\r\nRussia, many outside the \"Pale.\" Their own may not come to stay with\r\nthem nor even visit them. Should one of these wounded die, his people\r\nare deprived of the privilege of paying their last respects to him;\r\nunless they choose to violate the law and remain during the visit in\r\nhiding without registering their arrival.\r\n\r\nThe conditions under which the Jewish child may be educated are at\r\npresent fraught with similar difficulties. A great number of\r\neducational institutions in the south and west are now closed. The\r\nparents are recommended to transfer their children to other cities--in\r\nwhich case the local schools have been allowed to accept Jewish pupils\r\nin excess of their regulation percentage. But the possibility of\r\nutilising this privilege in institutions outside of the \"Pale\" is in\r\nits turn combined with the \"right of settlement,\" which condition\r\ncertainly limits the application of this privilege. With this\r\nexception, all other educational institutions of higher and middle\r\ngrades, strictly observe the usual percentage and the drawing of lots,\r\non the basis of which the Jewish students are accepted. These\r\nlimitations have become especially conspicuous, because the war has\r\ncompletely done away with the possibility of entering the universities\r\nof Germany and Austria, to which the Jewish youth flocked prior to the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nAnother question arises: Where should the Jewish students, who have\r\nbegun their studies at a foreign university, now turn? In vain do they\r\nknock at the doors of the higher institutions; these remain closed to\r\nthem, in spite of the fact that there are many vacancies there. They\r\ncannot get back to the universities of either Germany or Austria. Thus\r\nmust they waste years of persistent effort and vast amounts of energy,\r\nand very many of them will not be in a position to continue their\r\nstudies, and subsequently serve their own country, which is so sadly\r\nin need of educated men. Are all these discriminations against Jewish\r\npeople essential for the _great Russia_, which is now called upon to\r\nfree nations and peoples from a foreign tyranny?\r\n\r\nThe complete abrogation of all national disabilities must pass through\r\nour legislative institutions, but the loosening of the existing\r\nlimitations is a measure which it is perfectly possible to take at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEWISH RIGHTS AND THEIR ENEMIES\r\n\r\n\r\n   _Professor Maxim Maximovich Kovalevsky, one of the greatest\r\n   Russian sociologists, was born in 1851. Owing to his political\r\n   convictions, he had to leave Russia. In 1901 he founded in Paris\r\n   the Russian Higher School of Social Sciences, the faculty of\r\n   which consisted of exiled Russian scholars and political\r\n   emigrants. In 1905 he came back to Russia, resumed his University\r\n   work and took an active part in the political movement. In 1906\r\n   he was elected to the Duma and in 1907 to the Imperial Council.\r\n   He died in 1916._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEWISH RIGHTS AND THEIR ENEMIES\r\n\r\nBY MAXIM KOVALEVSKY\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the question should be put as to who at present stands in the way\r\nof Jewish equal rights and who demands still further limitations of\r\nthe Jews' participation in both military and civil service, the answer\r\nis that no one class follows a more systematic and more definite\r\nprogramme in this connection than the League of United Nobility. In\r\nthe year 1913 one of their conventions made the following\r\nrecommendations, recorded in a volume published in the name of the\r\nleague, and here quoted literally:\r\n\r\n   \"I. Jews and converted Jews should not be allowed to serve in the\r\n   army and navy either as regular recruits or as volunteers, nor\r\n   should they be admitted to military schools.\r\n\r\n   \"II. Jews and converted Jews should not be allowed to take part\r\n   in the electoral conventions of the Zemstvos.\r\n\r\n   \"III. Jews and converted Jews are not to be permitted to serve in\r\n   the Zemstvos.\r\n\r\n   \"IV. Jews and converted Jews are not to be permitted to serve in\r\n   any municipal capacity.\r\n\r\n   \"V. Jews and converted Jews should not be permitted to enter the\r\n   civil service.\r\n\r\n   \"VI. Jews and converted Jews should not be included in the lists\r\n   of jurors; they may not be appointed or elected to serve in\r\n   courts, they may not practice as either advocates or attorneys.\"\r\n\r\nThese recommendations are clearly at variance with the trend of\r\nRussian legislation throughout the reigns of Peter the Great,\r\nCatherine the Second and Alexander the First. Peter the Great called\r\ninto the service of the Russian government all subjects irrespective\r\nof their nationality or religion. His fellow champions were\r\nrepresentatives of different nationalities such as Bruce, Bauer,\r\nRepnin, Menshicov and Yaguzhinsky. As to Catherine the Second, our\r\ncode of laws still retains the expression of her wish that all the\r\npeoples of Russia, each according to the precepts of its religion,\r\nshould pray to the Almighty for the welfare of its rulers, and should\r\nall be equally benefited by its government.\r\n\r\nIn his \"Principles of the Russian Governmental Law\" Professor\r\nGradovsky says: \"In the reign of Peter the Great there were no general\r\nregulations concerning the Jews.\" Measures against the Jews date from\r\nthe reign of Catherine the First. During the reign of Catherine the\r\nSecond, little was added to the existing array of limitations. In the\r\ndistricts in which the first Partition of Poland found them, the Jews\r\nat that time enjoyed almost all the rights of the native Russian\r\ncitizen. Although the Empress recognized the \"Pale of Settlement\"\r\ncreated in the reign of Peter the Second, she, nevertheless, stretched\r\nits boundaries to include not only Little Russia but also the\r\nVice-Royalty of Ekaterinoslav and the province of Taurida, wherein the\r\nJews were granted all rights of citizenship. In the \"Regulations\r\nConcerning the Jews\" published in 1804, in the reign of Alexander the\r\nFirst, the principle of equal civil rights for this nation is brought\r\nout in Article 42. \"All the Jews in Russia,\" says this article,\r\n\"whether residents or new settlers or foreigners coming to transact\r\nbusiness are free and are to be under the protection of the law on a\r\npar with other Russian subjects.\" In commenting upon this article,\r\nProfessor Gradovsky writes that this is clearly an attempt to fuse the\r\nJewish nation with the rest of the Russian population by giving the\r\nformer definite civil rights.\r\n\r\nOnly during the last year of the reign of Alexander the First were\r\nsome measures adopted whereby the \"Pale of Settlement\" was narrowed\r\ndown because of a certain sect of \"Sabbathists,\" closely related to\r\nJudaism, which had greatly increased in numbers, particularly in the\r\nprovinces of Voronezh, Samara, Tula, and others. According to the\r\n\"Regulations Concerning the Jews\" of 1835, enacted in the reign of\r\nNicholas the First, the Jews retained the right to own all kinds of\r\nreal estate, with the exception of inhabited estates and to deal in\r\nall kinds of merchandise on the same basis as the other citizens,--of\r\ncourse, only within the \"Pale.\"\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that at this time the Jews were allowed to attend\r\ngovernmental schools of all grades, and that graduates from these\r\nwere granted certain privileges. It is only toward the end of the\r\nreign of Nicholas I that the government adopts a system of limitations\r\nrelating to the Jews, without, however, restraining their right to\r\nattend the governmental educational institutions. On the 31st of\r\nMarch, 1856, an imperial edict was issued ordering a revision of the\r\nexisting regulations relating to the Jews. Therein it is clearly\r\nstated that the purpose of this revision is to conciliate these\r\nregulations with the intention of the government to fuse this people\r\nwith the native population of the land. During the entire reign of\r\nAlexander II no limitations existed for the entrance of Jews into the\r\nUniversities and the other educational institutions. On the contrary,\r\naccording to Gradovsky, the limitations within the \"Pale\" did not\r\napply to persons desiring to obtain a higher education, namely to\r\nthose entering the medical academy, the universities, and the\r\nInstitute of Technology. Gradovsky refers to the continuation of the\r\n\"Code of Laws,\" of 1868. The book was published in 1875, while this\r\nfreedom was in full swing. Within the \"Pale,\" the Jews had equal\r\ncommercial rights with other citizens. Until the Polish rebellion of\r\n1863 the Jews were permitted to own real estate, not only in cities\r\nbut also in rural districts. After the rebellion this was forbidden to\r\nthem as well as to the Poles. The foreign Jew could come to Russia\r\nfreely and register on the same foreign passport as would be required\r\nfrom any other citizen of that country.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said, it follows that many of the limitations,\r\nwhich at present weigh down upon the Jews have been created only\r\nrecently. The present reign, too, was begun with measures favoring the\r\nJew. In 1903, in spite of the fact that the Jews, in accordance with a\r\nlaw which was confirmed in 1872, were forbidden to live in villages\r\neven within the \"Pale,\" two hundred of these villages were turned into\r\ntowns, and later fifty-seven more were added to this number. The\r\nmeasure rendered these places legally habitable by the Jews. On August\r\n11, 1904, a law was passed wherein it was emphatically stated that\r\nJews who were graduates from a university were to be permitted to live\r\nfreely everywhere in the Empire. But since the repression of the\r\nrevolutionary movement, this privilege has become a pretext for the\r\nrestriction of the admittance of Jews into higher educational\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nFrom the viewpoint of the interests of the Russian state, the existing\r\ndisabilities of the Jews are detrimental both to our economic life,\r\nand to the mutual relations among our citizens; they also work havoc\r\nupon the progress of education as well as upon the raising of the\r\ngeneral level of our culture. Measures limiting a portion of the\r\npopulation in its rights to acquire property, to obtain an education\r\nin middle and higher state schools, to assume the responsibilities of\r\na judge or of a lawyer, and, in general, restraining its freedom to\r\npursue a professional career--are clearly irreconcilable with the\r\npromises given us in the manifesto of the 17th of October, 1906.\r\n\r\nThe fear that the granting of equal rights to the Jews may deprive the\r\npeasant of his land, is perfectly groundless. There are many other\r\nmeans whereby the tiller of the soil may be assured the possession of\r\na portion of land. In the West we have systems such as that of the\r\nhomestead, based on the inalienability of the family property (_bien\r\nde famille_). Such systems may be traced back as far as the Middle\r\nAges. The mediæval law forbids the taking away from the peasant, even\r\nfor arrearage, of his agricultural implements and the cattle necessary\r\nfor his labour,--not to speak of his land, which, however, it would be\r\nimpossible to take away, since it is the suzerain that is its rightful\r\nowner. The indivisibility of the family estate, which only a short\r\ntime ago was recognised by the Appellatory Division of our Senate,\r\nwith reference to the Western Section, was achieving the same results\r\nbecause for the sale of such property the agreement of all the members\r\nof the family was required. Such a protection of the interests of the\r\npeasant landowner is essential in his relation to the capitalist,\r\nwhether it be a member of the landed gentry or a wealthy peasant,\r\nknown as a _Kulak_, or a Jew who lends money at interest, or an\r\nArmenian or, for that matter, a usurer of the Orthodox faith. In order\r\nthat the land be retained by the peasant it is far more essential that\r\nonly members of the peasant class be allowed to attend the auction\r\nsales of land sold because of the owner's arrears. And yet our law has\r\npermitted outsiders to attend if not the first auction sale, at least\r\nthe second. I am strongly in favour of protecting the peasant's\r\nproperty, but I cannot see that to achieve this goal, it is necessary\r\nfor a body politic based on law to limit any one's freedom of moving\r\nabout, settling or choosing a profession. This view is shared by some\r\nof the political writers in Russia who, like the late B.N. Chicherin,\r\nProfessor of the University of Moscow, have identified their names\r\nwith the defence of the idea of equal rights for the Jews.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JEWISH QUESTION AS A RUSSIAN QUESTION\r\n\r\n\r\n   _Dmitry Sergeyevich Merezhkovsky occupies an important place in\r\n   modern Russian letters and religious philosophy. He is\r\n   responsible for several books of poems and for a series of\r\n   ponderous historical novels. He is also the author of numerous\r\n   critical studies distinguished by an original method and an\r\n   extraordinary brilliancy. He was born in 1866._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JEWISH QUESTION AS A RUSSIAN QUESTION\r\n\r\nBY DMITRY MEREZHKOVSKY\r\n\r\n\r\nRussia ... Russia alone should be our deepest concern at present. The\r\ndestiny of the numerous races and nationalities that go to make Russia\r\nis the destiny of the Russian Empire itself. One would ascertain the\r\nattitude of these nationalities by asking them: \"Are you with Russia\r\nor is it your desire to exist apart from her? If you desire to exist\r\napart from her--why, then, do you appeal to us for help? If with\r\nus--let us then, in this time of terror, disdain to consider our\r\npersonal fortunes and let our thoughts be with Russia and with her\r\nalone. For without her your existence is inconceivable; her rise is\r\nyour rise and her fall is your fall.\"\r\n\r\nWe would like very much to say that there is no such thing as the\r\nJewish, Polish, Ukrainian, Armenian, Georgian, question, that there\r\nis only one question--the Russian. Yes, we would like to, but we\r\ncannot; the Russian people have yet to earn the right to say that, and\r\ntherein lies their tragedy.... The moment Russian idealism ventures to\r\ntackle any of those complicated national home problems,--it becomes\r\nweak, impotent and therefore irresponsible.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish question is a striking illustration of what we have just\r\nsaid. What do we owe the Jews? Indignation? Or the admission that\r\nanti-Semitism is abominable? But we admitted that a long time ago, and\r\nour indignation runs so high and is so clearly outspoken that it is\r\nbeyond one's power even to speak calmly of it. The only thing we can\r\ndo is to join our voice to that of the Jews. And we do.\r\n\r\nBut outcries, loud as they may be, are not sufficient, and it is the\r\nconsciousness of the fact, that the outcries are insufficient and that\r\nat the present moment we possess no other weapons with which to fight\r\nthe evil that wearies and harrows us.\r\n\r\nWhat misery, and pain, and shame!\r\n\r\nBut in spite of the pain and the shame we cry out and reiterate and\r\ndeclare to the people around us, who are ignorant of the table of\r\nmultiplication, that two and two make four, that the Jews are human\r\nbeings like us; that they are neither enemies nor traitors to their\r\ncountry; that they are as good citizens as we are; that they love\r\nRussia no less than we do, and that anti-Semitism is a disgraceful\r\nstigma upon Russia's face. But apart from our righteous indignation,\r\nmay we not be allowed calmly to utter one thought that occurs to us at\r\nthis moment?\r\n\r\n\"Judophilism\" and \"Judophobia\" are closely related. A blind denial of\r\na nationality engenders an equally blind affirmation of it. An\r\nabsolute \"Nay\" naturally brings forth an absolute \"Yea.\"\r\n\r\nWhom do we call a \"Judophile\" in Russia at the present time?\r\nPresumably, it is he or she who loves the Jews with a singular love,\r\nwho finds in them greater values than in any other nationality. In the\r\neyes of the so-called \"true Russians\" we, the Intellectuals, are such\r\nJudophiles.\r\n\r\n\"Why worry over the Jews all the time?\" the Russian Nationalists say\r\nto us.\r\n\r\nNow, how on earth can we stop worrying over the Jews, and, for that\r\nmatter, over the Poles, Armenians, Ukrainians, Georgians, and so\r\nforth? When in our presence some one is being outraged, we cannot\r\nmerely pass on; it is not humane. We must help him who is being\r\nassailed. At least, we ought to join our voice with his in crying out\r\nfor help. This is precisely what we have been doing, and woe to us, if\r\nwe cease to do it, cease to be human beings in order to become\r\nRussians.\r\n\r\nA forest of national problems has grown around us, and the sounds of\r\nthe Russian language are being drowned by the voices of all the\r\nnumerous peoples that inhabit Russia. It is inevitable and just. We\r\nare not well, but with them it is still worse. We have great pain, but\r\ntheir's is greater. We must forget ourselves for their sake.\r\n\r\nThat is why we say to the \"Nationalists\":\r\n\r\nCease oppressing the non-Russian element of our empire, so that we\r\nmay have the right to be Russians, and that we may with dignity show\r\nour national face, as that of a human being, not that of a beast.\r\nCease to be 'Judophobes' so that we may cease to be 'Judophiles.'\r\nHere is an instance taken at random.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish question has a religious as well as a national aspect.\r\nBetween Judaism and Christianity, as between two poles, there are\r\nstrong attractions and equally strong repulsions. Judaism gave birth\r\nto Christianity. The New Testament issued from the Old Testament. Paul\r\nthe Apostle, who more than any one else fought Judaism, wrote: \"For I\r\ncould wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my\r\nkinsmen according to the flesh.\"\r\n\r\nBut whereas we may speak of attractions, it is not well for us to\r\nspeak of repulsions. Indeed, how can we quarrel with him, who has no\r\nvoice? The disabilities of the Jews seal our lips. We must not\r\nseparate Christianity from Judaism, for it means, as one Jew put it,\r\nthe establishment of another, spiritual \"Pale of Settlement.\" Let us\r\ndo away with the physical Pale, then we will be able to discuss the\r\nspiritual one. Until then, all our protestations and declarations of\r\nrighteousness will only prove to the Jews our insincerity.\r\n\r\nWhy has the Jewish question become so keen in time of war? For the\r\nsame reason that the rest of the national problems have made\r\nthemselves felt.\r\n\r\nWe have called the present struggle a war of liberation. We entered\r\nthe war with the avowed purpose of liberating those who are situated\r\nat a distance from us. While liberating distant strangers, why then do\r\nwe oppress those who live close by our side? We wage war against\r\ntyranny outside of Russia, and we allow oppression to reign within\r\nher. We pity everybody but the Jews. Why?\r\n\r\nAre they not dying on the battlefields for our sake? Do they not love\r\nus--who hate them? Do we not hate them--who love us? If we continue to\r\nact as we have done in the past, would not everybody lose faith in us,\r\nand would not the nations of the earth be justified in saying to us:\r\n\"You can love only from afar. You are liars!\"\r\n\r\nWe believed our righteousness to be our strongest weapon. We wanted to\r\nconquer brute force by the truth. If we persist in this desire, let us\r\nnot lie; let us not weaken our truth by falsehood.\r\n\r\nThe Teutons say: \"We fight to be the rulers of the world,\"--and they\r\nact accordingly. We say: \"We fight for universal peace, for the\r\nemancipation of the world,\" but we do not act accordingly.\r\n\r\nLet us begin then with the liberation of the Jews at home. Let the\r\noppressed nations in our land bear in mind, however, that only a free\r\nRussian people will be able to give them freedom.\r\n\r\nLet the Jews remember that the Jewish question is a Russian\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCERNING THE IDEOLOGY OF THE JEWISH QUESTION\r\n\r\n\r\n   _Vyacheslav Ivanovich Ivanov was born in 1866. A poet of great\r\n   mastery and a refined critic, his thought, is steeped in\r\n   hellenism and in the most abstruse mystic lore._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCERNING THE IDEOLOGY OF THE JEWISH QUESTION\r\n\r\nBY VYACHESLAV IVANOV\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the wiliest and the most harmful doctrines of our times is, I\r\nbelieve, the fashionable ideology of spiritual anti-Semitism. It\r\nattributes to Aryanism, which by the way, is a quantity ethnically if\r\nnot linguistically enigmatical, many excellent and splendid qualities,\r\nwhile in the Semitic influences and admixtures to the Aryan element it\r\nsees nothing but negative energies, which have always hindered the\r\nfree unfolding of the creative powers of the Aryan genius.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine would deprive Hellenism of Aphrodite, who came to the\r\nHellenes from the Semites, and would cut the main and most profound\r\nroot of Christianity, namely its faith in a \"transcendental,\" or,\r\nplainly, living God. Spiritual anti-Semitism cuts the body of\r\nChristianity into two halves, and keeps only that half whose forms\r\nare justified by analogies borrowed from the Greek religious thought,\r\njustified, in the eyes of learned dodgers who choose to play the part\r\nof Romanticists of Aryanism.\r\n\r\nThis anti-religious and secretly anti-Christian theory, one of the\r\nTrojan wooden horses made in Germany, was clearly intended to\r\n\"Indo-Germanize\" the world, when suddenly the twilight of the Gods\r\nswooped down upon the Berlin Valhalla. Nevertheless it has succeeded\r\nin seducing many minds, obscured by prejudices. It was hailed by\r\n\"immanent\" philosophers and anti-Semites out of political\r\nconsiderations and psychological predispositions, as well as by\r\nChristians mindless of their kin, by anti-church people of all kinds,\r\nand even by atheists of Jewish birth, who are ashamed of their kin and\r\nwho are in the world like salt which has lost its strength.\r\n\r\nThe more vivid and profound the church consciousness is in a\r\nChristian, the more vividly and profoundly does he feel himself, I\r\nshall not say a philo-Semite, but truly a Semite in spirit. We have so\r\nthoroughly confused, distorted and forgotten all the holy and true\r\ntraditions, we have so thoroughly lost the habit of applying our\r\nreason to the lucid, old truths learned by heart, that this statement\r\nmay sound like a paradox.\r\n\r\nVladimir Solovyov's touching affection for Judaism is a plain and\r\nnatural manifestation of his love for Christ and of his inner\r\nexperience of being merged in the Church. The body of the Church is\r\nfor the mystic the true, although invisible body of Christ, and\r\nthrough Christ it is the body begotten of Abraham's seed. The latter\r\nbody, like the curtain of the temple in Jerusalem in the hour of our\r\nSaviour's death, was rent in twain, and that half of it which is\r\nJudaism passionately seeks the whole, longs and yearns, and pours out\r\nits wrath upon the second half, which in its turn longs for the\r\nreunion and the integrity of mystic Israel.\r\n\r\nWhoever is within the Church loves Mary; and whoever loves Mary loves\r\nalso Israel whose name together with those of the patriarchs and\r\nprophets solemnly resounds in our liturgical hymns. The minds of those\r\nwho in various times represented the earthly organisation of the\r\nChurch could be poisoned by hatred of the Jews, in whom they suspected\r\nChrist's enemies, precisely because it seemed to them that the Jewish\r\nnation was already void of the true Jewish spirit and was not of\r\nAbraham's seed. But what do all these errings mean in face of the\r\nsingle testimony of the apostle Paul?\r\n\r\nI have placed myself, in these lines, on the standpoint of religious\r\nthought, and I wish to remind people of the truth that to be a\r\nChristian means to be not a heathen, not simply an Aryan by blood, but\r\nto become through baptism, which sacramentally includes also\r\ncircumcision, a child of Abraham, and, therefore, in a sacramental\r\nsense a brother to Abraham's descendants, who, according to the word\r\nof the apostle, are not deprived of inheritance, and whom, according\r\nto Christ's word, we must bless even if they curse us. Personally, I\r\ndo not believe that the Jews hate Christ, unless it be that they hate\r\nHim in spite of their secret, presensuous love for Him, hate Him with\r\nthat peculiar hatred which comes from jealousy and which the Hellenes\r\ndefined as the negative hypostase of Eros, as anti-Eros.\r\n\r\nI think that Providence has appointed the Jews eternally to test the\r\nChristian peoples in their love for Christ and in their faithfulness\r\nto Him. And when His work will be consummated in us, then their\r\ndemands and expectations will be fulfilled and they will be convinced\r\nthat they need not wait for another Messiah. As for us, if we were\r\nwalking with Christ, we would not fear our examiners: for love\r\nconquers fear.\r\n\r\nThe accounts the Russian soul has to settle with that of the Jew are\r\ncomplex. In spite of the fact they have frequently and most completely\r\nbeen united in suffering, the Jew is loath to love that which is most\r\nsacred to the Russian soul. For the benefit of those in whom resound\r\nthe separate clashing voices of this spiritual dispute, I shall quote\r\nin conclusion this final and irrevocable verdict of Dostoyevsky, who\r\nhad the reputation of being an anti-Semite:\r\n\r\n\"All that is demanded by humanity, justice and Christian law, must be\r\ndone for the Jews. I shall add to these words that in spite of the\r\nconsiderations exposed above, I definitely stand for an increase of\r\nthe Jewish rights in formal legislation and, if possible, for the\r\nremoval of all the legal disabilities which stand in the way of their\r\nequality with the rest of the population (although in some cases they\r\nhave already more rights than the aboriginal population, or, better,\r\nthey have greater possibilities to utilise the rights which they\r\nenjoy).\"\r\n\r\n(\"A Writer's Journal,\" March, 1877, III, p. 4.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LITTLE BOY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LITTLE BOY\r\n\r\n(A STORY)\r\n\r\nBY MAXIM GORKY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is hard to tell this little story,--it is so simple. When I was a\r\nyouth, I used to gather the children of our street on Sunday mornings\r\nduring the spring and summer seasons and take them with me to the\r\nfields and woods. I took great pleasure in the friendship of these\r\nlittle people, who were as gay as birds.\r\n\r\nThe children were only too glad to leave the dusty, narrow streets of\r\nthe city. Their mothers provided them with slices of bread, while I\r\nbought them dainties and filled a big bottle with cider, and like a\r\nshepherd, walked behind my carefree little lambs, while we passed\r\nthrough the town and the fields on our way to the green forest,\r\nbeautiful and caressing in its array of Spring.\r\n\r\nWe always started on our journey early in the morning when the church\r\nbells were ushering in the early mass, and we were accompanied by the\r\nchimes and the clouds of dust raised by the children's nimble feet.\r\n\r\nIn the heat of noon, exhausted with playing, my companions would\r\ngather at the edge of the forest, and after that, having eaten their\r\nfood, the smaller children would lie down and sleep in the shade of\r\nhazel and snow-ball trees, while the ten-year-old boys would flock\r\naround me and ask me to tell them stories. I would satisfy their\r\ndesire, chattering as eagerly as the children themselves, and often,\r\nin spite of the self-assurance of youth and the ridiculous pride which\r\nit takes in the miserable crumbs of worldly wisdom it possesses, I\r\nwould feel like a twenty-year-old child in a conclave of sages.\r\n\r\nOverhead is the blue veil of the spring sky, and before us lies the\r\ndeep forest, brooding in wise silence. Now and then the wind whispers\r\ngently and stirs the fragrant shadows of the forest, and again does\r\nthe soothing silence caress us with a motherly caress. White clouds\r\nare sailing slowly across the azure heavens. Viewed from the earth,\r\nheated by the sun, the sky appears cold, and it is strange to see the\r\nclouds melt away in the blue. And all around me--little people, dear\r\nlittle people, destined to partake of all the sorrows and all the joys\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nThese were my happy days, my true holidays, and my soul already dusty\r\nwith the knowledge of life's evil was bathed and refreshed in the\r\nclear-eyed wisdom of child-like thoughts and feelings.\r\n\r\nOnce, when I was coming out of the city on my way to the fields,\r\naccompanied by a crowd of children we met an unknown little Jewish\r\nboy. He was barefooted and his shirt was torn; his eyebrows were\r\nblack, his body slim and his hair grew in curls like that of a little\r\nsheep. He was excited and he seemed to have been crying. The lids of\r\nhis dull-black eyes, swollen and red, contrasted with his face, which,\r\nemaciated by starvation, was ghastly pale.\r\n\r\nHaving found himself face to face with the crowd of children, he stood\r\nstill in the middle of the road, burrowing his bare feet in the dust,\r\nwhich early in the morning is so deliciously cool. In fear, he half\r\nopened the dark lips of his fair mouth,--the next second he leaped\r\nright on to the sidewalk.\r\n\r\n\"Catch him!\" the children started to shout gaily and in a chorus. \"A\r\nJewish boy! Catch the Jew boy!\"\r\n\r\nI waited, thinking that he would run away. His thin, big-eyed face was\r\nall fear; his lips quivered; he stood there amid the shouts and the\r\nmocking laughter. Pressing his shoulders against the fence and hiding\r\nhis hands behind his back, he stretched and strangely appeared to have\r\ngrown bigger.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly he spoke,--very calmly and in a distinct and correct\r\nRussian.\r\n\r\n\"If you wish,--I will show you some tricks.\"\r\n\r\nI took this offer for a means of self-defence. But the children at\r\nonce became interested. The larger and coarser boys alone looked with\r\ndistrust and suspicion on the little Jewish boy. The children of our\r\nstreet were in a state of guerilla warfare with the children of other\r\nstreets; in addition, they were deeply convinced of their own\r\nsuperiority and were loath to brook the rivalry of other children.\r\n\r\nThe smaller boys approached the matter more simply.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, show us,\" they shouted.\r\n\r\nThe handsome, slim boy moved away from the fence, bent his thin body\r\nbackward, and touching the ground with his hands, he tossed up his\r\nfeet and remained standing on his arms, shouting:\r\n\r\n\"Hop! Hop! Hop!\"\r\n\r\nThen he began to spin in the air, swinging his body lightly and\r\nadroitly. Through the holes of his shirt and pants we caught glimpses\r\nof the greyish skin of his slim body, of his sharply bulging and\r\nangular shoulder-blades, knees and elbows. It seemed to us as if with\r\none more twist of his body his thin bones would crack and break into\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nHe worked hard until the shirt grew wet with sweat about his\r\nshoulders. After each especially daring feat he looked into the\r\nchildren's faces with an artificial, weary smile, and it was\r\nunpleasant to see his dull eyes, grown large with pain. Their strange\r\nand unsteady glance was not like that of a child.\r\n\r\nThe lads encouraged him with loud outcries. Many imitated him, rolling\r\nin the dust and shouting for joy, pain and envy. But the joyous\r\nminutes were soon over when the boy, bringing his exhibition to an\r\nend, looked upon the children with the benevolent smile of a\r\nthoroughbred artist and stretching forth his hand said:\r\n\r\n\"Now give me something.\"\r\n\r\nWe all became silent, until one of the children said:\r\n\r\n\"Money?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the lad.\r\n\r\n\"Look at him,\" said the children.\r\n\r\n\"For money, we could do those tricks ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nThe audience became hostile toward the artist, and betook itself to\r\nthe field, ridiculing and insulting him. Of course, none of them had\r\nany money. I myself, had only seven kopecks about me. I put two coins\r\nin the boy's dusty palm. He moved them with his finger and with a\r\nkindly smile said: \"Thank you.\"\r\n\r\nHe went away, and I noticed that his shirt around his back was all in\r\nblack blotches and was clinging close to his shoulder-blades.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on, what is it?\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped, turned about, scrutinised me and said distinctly, with the\r\nsame kindly smile:\r\n\r\n\"You mean the blotches on my back? That's from falling off the\r\ntrapeze. It happened on Easter. My father is still lying in bed, but I\r\nam quite well now.\"\r\n\r\nI lifted his shirt. On his back, running down from his left shoulder\r\nto the side, was a wide dark scratch which had now become dried up\r\ninto a thick crust. While he was exhibiting his tricks the wound broke\r\nopen in several spots and red blood was now trickling from the\r\nopenings.\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't hurt any more,\" said he with a smile. \"It doesn't hurt, it\r\nonly itches.\"\r\n\r\nAnd bravely, as it becomes a hero, he looked in my eyes and went on,\r\nspeaking like a serious grown-up person:\r\n\r\n\"You think--I have been doing this for myself? Upon my word--I have\r\nnot. My father ... there is not a crust of bread in the house, and my\r\nfather is lying badly hurt. So you see, I have to work hard. And to\r\nmake matters worse, we are Jews, and everybody laughs at us.\r\nGood-bye.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke with a smile, cheerfully and courageously. With a nod of his\r\ncurly head, he quickly went on, passing by the houses which looked at\r\nhim with their glass eyes, indifferent and dead.\r\n\r\nAll this is insignificant and simple, is it not?\r\n\r\nYet many a time in the darkest days of my life I remembered with\r\ngratitude the courage and bravery of the little Jewish boy. And now,\r\nin these sorrowful days of suffering and bloody outrages which fall\r\nupon the grey head of the ancient nation, the creator of Gods and\r\nreligion,--I think again of the boy, for in him I see the symbol of\r\ntrue manly bravery,--not the pliant patience of slaves, who live by\r\nuncertain hopes, but the courage of the strong who are certain of\r\ntheir victory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FATHERLAND FOR ALL\r\n\r\n\r\n   _Fyodor Sologub is the pseudonym of Fyodor Kuzmich Teternikov,\r\n   novelist and poet.

He was born\r\n   in 1864._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FATHERLAND FOR ALL\r\n\r\nBY FYODOR SOLOGUB\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great war, which we did not want, but which we are conducting with\r\nintense fervour, exerting all our spiritual and material forces, has\r\nput before our consciousness and our moral sense the fundamental\r\nproblems of our social and political organisation. Not in vain have\r\nthe newspapers hastened to style this war a Fatherland War. The\r\nquestion of the Fatherland has suddenly acquired for us a peculiar\r\nkeenness and significance.\r\n\r\nThe war has taken Russian society and the Russian people by surprise,\r\nbut luckily it has come to us at the moment when the questions which\r\nwere confronting us had already been settled both in our reason and\r\nconscience. The heroic labour of the Russian intellectual has not been\r\nin vain. And now what we have to do is not to argue and demonstrate,\r\nbut to determine the meaning of events. And the meaning of what is\r\ngoing on is such that we are forced to consider this war not only as\r\none of defence, but also as one of emancipation. It appears to us not\r\nonly as a struggle for the rights of small states threatened by large\r\nones, and as a war against German militarism, but also as a strife\r\nagainst...[1] internal danger, whatever may be the various forms this\r\ndanger assumes.\r\n\r\nThe first and chief danger which threatened, and is still threatening\r\nus, is the danger of internal division and disorder. The equal\r\nreadiness and zeal to stand up for her which all the peoples\r\ninhabiting Russia have manifested has shown how unjust is the\r\npreaching of hatred and of narrow nationalism. The peoples who bear\r\nthe same burdens of our state as the Russians do, who defend our\r\ncommon fatherland just as faithfully as the Russians, thereby assert\r\nthat our fatherland is for all, that Russia is for every one who is\r\nconsidered a Russian subject and meets his duties toward the state.\r\nRussia is not only for those who are Russians by language and birth,\r\nshe is for all who live under her sovereign dominion. No one in Russia\r\nis benefited by the unequal rights of her various peoples; this\r\ninequality does not add to our political power, it only supports our\r\ninternal disorder. Its abolition by no means contradicts the\r\nfundamental conceptions of Russian statehood.\r\n\r\nYou will say that Russia has been created by the Russian race. Well,\r\nthen, her policy must be determined by the qualities of the Russian\r\npopular spirit,--but animosity and exclusiveness are things strange\r\nand repulsive to it. The soul of the Russian people is trusting and\r\nopen to all influences. And this is only natural: only that nation can\r\nbecome the basis of a great state which is able with ease and joy to\r\nunite with all the races it meets on its historic road. The history of\r\nRussia illustrates this. Besides, who has ever asserted that people\r\nborn unto the Russian tongue are racially pure Slavs?\r\n\r\nYou will say that Russia is a Christian state. Agreed. But do not\r\nChrist's commandments teach us to see a friend and a brother and one's\r\nequal in every man? The more we are Christians, the less of animosity\r\nand exclusiveness can be in our hearts. What difference does it make\r\nthat two men speak different languages and pray in different ways?\r\nWhen it is a question of paying duties and taxes, and bearing arms in\r\ndefence of the fatherland, religious and race peculiarities do not\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThe fatherland is for all of us, because we are all for the\r\nfatherland. The fatherland is our common home, and this home we build,\r\nkeep in good order, and defend. We build our common home not like\r\nhirelings, to whom, after they get their pay, the building becomes\r\nalien. In rearing, decorating and defending it we bargain with no one,\r\nwe give everything that is necessary for its upbuilding and\r\ndefence,--we give our property, our labour, our very life. Even when\r\nour labour appears selfish, even then--provided it is not criminal--it\r\nis for the good of our common home: for, all that adds to the\r\nhappiness, well-being and freedom of each one living in the home, adds\r\nto its strength and beauty.\r\n\r\nWe build our common home, decorate it and defend it, and we do it with\r\njoy and willingness because in our common home we are neither\r\nhirelings nor guests. In our common home, then, who are we? We must\r\nknow and always remember that in our common home we are all masters of\r\nthe house. It is not our right, but our duty toward our home, of which\r\nwe must take care just as every good master takes care of his house.\r\nThe consciousness of the fact that we are the masters of our common\r\nhome is clear; for it is seen that every one of us in whom conscience\r\nand reason do not slumber, feels responsible for the disorder of our\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nNot an outsider, nor a congress of allies, nor some one social class\r\nshall regulate our affairs for the best of Poland, Finland, the Jews\r\nand the rest. Neither our allies, nor any one of our social classes,\r\nnor the wisest and strongest among us,--but all of us Russian\r\ncitizens, all of us who joyously and willingly bear the burden of\r\nstatehood, are called upon to settle in conscience and reason, the\r\nfundamental problems of our great home-building.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the face of the common foe we are all united. We have mustered all\r\nour forces for the defence of our native land from the hostile\r\ninvasion. We are all brothers, all children of one fatherland, and to\r\nall Russia is a good mother loving all equally well. Many are the\r\npeoples Russia has gathered under her dominion and she is to all\r\nequally benevolent.\r\n\r\nHow eager is one to say these words, to have the right to utter them!\r\nBut we have it not. Not toward all is Russia equally benevolent, and\r\nin the hour of great trials and high deeds she is still unable, still\r\nunwilling, to tear asunder the fatal chain, the terrible \"Pale of\r\nSettlement.\"\r\n\r\nWhenever I met Russian Jews abroad, I always marvelled at the\r\nstrangely tenacious love for Russia which they preserve. They speak of\r\nRussia with the same longing and the same tenderness as the Russian\r\nemigrants; they are equally eager to return and equally saddened if\r\nthe return is impossible. Wherefore should they love Russia, who is so\r\nharsh and inhospitable toward them?\r\n\r\nStrange as it may sound, there are children who love their cruel\r\nstepmothers. Of course, they are exceptions; usually such stepmothers\r\nare hated. But in the case of Jews such exceptions become the general\r\nrule: the Jews love the same Russia that is so cruel toward them.\r\n\r\nSome one's interests demand that the Jews should be oppressed, stabled\r\nin the \"Pale of Settlement,\" limited in the right to education, and in\r\nother respects. But to whose interest is it? Russia's? Surely not.\r\n\r\nSocial relations in Russia, as in every civilised state, must rest on\r\nthe immovable foundations of justice, reason, and conscience. All\r\nthose persons who are united by the fact of their belonging to the\r\nRussian state must have, within the limits of the empire, the minimum\r\nof rights, which, to our shame, are refused the Jews. This minimum\r\neach one of us receives not for his personal or racial deserts or\r\ndistinctive traits, but as a citizen of the state. To obey the common\r\nRussian laws, to pay the established taxes, to serve in the army,--all\r\nthese are the duties of a Russian subject, corresponding to the amount\r\nof rights of which he can be deprived only by a court ruling for a\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nA man not dishonoured by a court decision may not live where he wants\r\nto,--because he is a Jew; a boy who has not been dismissed from any\r\nschool for deficiency or misconduct, may not enter the \"gymnasium,\"\r\nwhere there are plenty of vacancies, but where the few vacancies set\r\naside by a percentage rule for the Jewish brats, are eagerly filled by\r\nthem; a soldier's wife may not visit her wounded and agonising husband\r\nbecause he happens to be dying outside the \"Pale\"; the deceased may\r\nnot be buried in the town where he died, for he had no right of\r\nresidence in that town,--what does all this mean? Who needs all this?\r\n\r\nAll these people are Russian subjects, not our enemies, and yet they\r\nare treated in this fashion. What is the purpose of it all? Is it in\r\norder to kindle among the Jews the fire of implacable hatred of Russia\r\nand turn them into our enemies? But then we must be logical and not\r\ntolerate them in the \"Pale of Settlement\"; we must exile or destroy\r\nthem. But a civilised state will never persuade itself to commit such\r\nacts, inhuman though logical. And if it does not decide to do that, it\r\nmust, for the sake of its safety and dignity, grant to every Russian\r\ncitizen the elementary human rights. It is imperative that every\r\nRussian citizen should have every reason to love Russia and no right\r\nto hate her. If that portion of the Russian population which is\r\ndeprived of rights still loves Russia, it is because the people of\r\npurely Russian extraction have no hatred for people of non-Russian\r\nbirth, and our co-citizens are fully aware of it. They know that their\r\ndisabilities are a burden to ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the Jewish disabilities is most imperatively dictated\r\nto us also by our dignity as a body politic. The name of Russian\r\nsubject must be respected within our country, for otherwise the\r\ncivilised world will not grow accustomed to respect Russia. Our\r\ncountry is feared for its military might and loved for the fine\r\nqualities of its people, but it will be respected only when it becomes\r\na land of free men.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Several words here are crossed out by Russian\r\ncensorship.--Translator's Note.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON NATIONALISM\r\n\r\n\r\n   _Vladimir Sereyevich Solovyov is known to the world as the\r\n   noblest and the most profound of Russian thinkers.

Solovyov was born in 1853 and died in 1900._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON NATIONALISM\r\n\r\nA speech delivered by Vladimir Solovyov at a University Dinner on\r\nFebruary 8th, 1890\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dominating idea of the present time is the national idea. Of\r\ncourse, there is nothing bad about this. But the national idea as well\r\nas any other, can be very differently interpreted. The conception of\r\nnationalism which is very popular in our country reminds one of the\r\nfamous answer made by a Hottentot to a missionary, who asked him\r\nwhether he knows the difference between good and bad. \"Sure I know,\"\r\nretorted the Hottentot. \"Good--is when I steal other people's cattle\r\nand wives, and bad--when my own are stolen.\" In a like manner, many of\r\nour nationalists praise the love for their people and brand other\r\npeople's patriotism as treason.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the wide diffusion of this view, I persist in my belief\r\nthat the Russian national idea cannot be based on a Hottentot-like\r\nmorality, that it cannot exclude the principles of justice and\r\nall-human solidarity. It is time that we should see the realisation of\r\nthe true Russian idea and of all that it implies, namely: Poland's\r\nautonomy, Jewish equal rights and the untrammelled development of all\r\nthe nationalities that people the Russian Empire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCERNING THE LEGAL STATUS OF THE JEWS\r\n\r\n\r\n   _Count Ivan Ivanovich Tolstoy, born in 1858, occupied the post of\r\n   Minister of Public Instruction at the time of Count Witte's\r\n   premiership. In 1907 he was a candidate for election to the Duma,\r\n   as deputy from Petrograd. A distinguished archeologist and\r\n   connoisseur of art, he was for many years the vice-president of\r\n   the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCERNING THE LEGAL STATUS OF THE JEWS\r\n\r\nBY COUNT IVAN TOLSTOY\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you,\r\ndo ye even so to them.\" (St. Matthew, 7, 12.) This is the divine law,\r\nwhich it is the task of every one who considers and feels himself a\r\nChristian to follow, and which should also be strictly observed by a\r\nState. Now, would any one of the Christians who owe their allegiance\r\nto the Russian state consent to be treated as the Jews are in Russia?\r\nWould he like to be confined within a certain definite zone of\r\nsettlement, to be kept from giving his children an education, and to\r\nfind himself excluded from many fields of honest and honourable\r\nendeavour? Would he like, all through his life to be humiliated before\r\nhis co-citizens of other faith and birth?\r\n\r\nYou despise them, hate them, and accuse them of all that it may please\r\nany maniac or liar to invent about them. Yet you demand of the Jews\r\nthat they should help you, when you stand in need of help. You,\r\nJew-haters, serve somebody or something, but truly it is not God, it\r\nis not the cause of goodness that you are serving. In your blindness\r\nyou harm, above all, yourself and our country, our dear,\r\nlong-suffering Russia, whom the Jews, your co-citizens, love and\r\ncannot help loving more than you do. They know that Russia hates none\r\nof her faithful and loving children and that they are hated only by\r\npeople, who, either by nature or because of a poor education, cannot\r\nexist without hating some one or something. By their deeds ye shall\r\nknow them, these wolves disguised as sheep.\r\n\r\nCombat evil and side with good, do good, and do not judge a man by the\r\nfact that his parents are Jewish or Christian, or that he was born\r\ninto one faith or another. Remember that we are all born equally naked\r\nand that we must all die. Therefore, do not boast of your birth; bear\r\nfirmly in mind that we are all equal before God, before Truth and\r\nthat we must be equal before the Law.\r\n\r\nAs for the legal disabilities of a portion of citizens who are guilty\r\nof no crime,--such as injustice must be completely condemned. In\r\npractice, such a policy has always borne and always will bear fruits\r\nof evil. The very existence of such an injustice corrupts and puts in\r\njeopardy the social body which tolerates it.... No benefits which may\r\nbe derived by individual persons or social classes from an inequality\r\nof rights can justify the State in depriving a group of citizens of\r\ntheir full rights, as a result of their race and faith. This is the\r\nA-B-C of justice, and those who do not know it have yet to learn what\r\njustice is.\r\n\r\nNeither are the Jews better than we are, nor are we better than they.\r\nWe are all human beings and, as such, we must all be equal before the\r\nimpartial and dispassionate Law, which determines our rights and\r\nduties towards the State and society. Good and bad people, I repeat,\r\nare everywhere, and the proportion is roughly the same among us as\r\namong them. Let us, therefore, strive for the realisation of justice\r\non earth, and let us believe in the final triumph of truth. The rest\r\nwill be added unto us. Without such a faith it is hard to live....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOUNDED SOLDIER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOUNDED SOLDIER\r\n\r\nBY LEONID ANDREYEV\r\n\r\n\r\nA sad and disquieting image often rises before my eyes.\r\n\r\nIt happened in Petrograd, on the staircase of a large, new building,\r\none apartment of which was transformed into a private ward. When I\r\nentered the porter's lodge, on my way to a friend, I saw that it was\r\nfilled with wounded soldiers, who had just arrived, while curious\r\nspectators crowded near the plate-glass door. The house was new and\r\nluxuriously furnished, and the elevator on which the wounded soldiers\r\nwere taken up, was carefully covered with some kind of cloth, for fear\r\nthat the velvet would be soiled and the insects would get into the\r\nseams. Upstairs the wounded were cordially greeted by a priest and a\r\nman dressed in white. After having kissed the priest's hand, the\r\nwounded, evidently embarrassed by the bright light and the luxury of\r\nthe place, entered the ward awkwardly and silently. There were no\r\nseriously wounded on stretchers among them, all were able to walk; yet\r\nit was painful to look at them.\r\n\r\nThere was a wounded soldier in one of the last groups taken up by the\r\nelevator who strangely attracted everybody's attention. He was a\r\nshort, young, lean, ghastly pale Jew. All the wounded were pale, but\r\nthere was something sinister about the pallor of his face; it was a\r\npaleness of an utterly exhausted, anæmic or fatally sick man. He was\r\nwalking alone, feebly moving his feet, and like everybody else bent to\r\nkiss the hand of the priest, but he hardly knew what he was doing, and\r\nhis kiss was strangely indifferent and meaningless. He was evidently\r\nwounded in his arm, which he held stretched out. Several fingers were\r\nwrapped up, the others, which were not injured, were covered with a\r\ncrust of dirt and blood. But on his coat, on the back, there was a\r\nlarge brown blotch of blood, a very large one, covering almost half of\r\nhis back and in the midst of the soft cloth it bulged stiffly as if\r\nstarched. And this horrible spot told the simple story of the battle\r\nand the wound. But it was not the stain that made him so peculiarly\r\nconspicuous--other soldiers had similar blotches--it was rather his\r\nunusual pallor, thinness and smallness, and, above all, an expression\r\nof peculiar timidity, as if he was not at all sure whether his\r\nbehaviour was appropriate and whether he had come to the right place.\r\nThe faces of the other wounded soldiers, non-Jews, expressed nothing\r\nof the kind. These men were confused, but not afraid, and walked\r\nstraight ahead, into the ward.\r\n\r\nAnd then I recollected how a military sanitarian, whose duty it is to\r\nescort a train of wounded soldiers, had told me that the wounded Jews\r\nactually try not to moan. It was hardly credible, and at first I did\r\nnot believe it; how was it possible, that a wounded soldier, freshly\r\npicked up from the battlefield and lying among wounded soldiers should\r\ntry not to moan, as all do? But the sanitarian confirmed his statement\r\nand added: they are afraid to attract attention to themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish soldier entered the ward after the others, and the door was\r\nclosed, but his image, sorrowful and disquieting, lingered before my\r\neyes. Of course, he, too, tried not to attract attention--and therein\r\nis the cause of his shyness; and when his wound will be dressed and he\r\nwill be put into bed, he will also try not to moan. For, what right\r\nhas he to moan aloud?\r\n\r\nIt is very possible, that he has no right of settlement in Petrograd\r\nand is allowed to stay there only as one of the wounded; a rather\r\nprecarious right! And that which is home for others is nothing but a\r\nkind of honourable imprisonment for him; he will be kept for a while,\r\nthen they will let him go, saying: \"Go away, you must not be here.\"\r\n\r\nAnd what if his mother, or sister, or father, who also have no right\r\nof settlement, will desire to come to him and kiss his bloodstained\r\nhand which has defended Russia--vague, distant Russia? But these\r\nreflections and questions came to my mind later. At the moment, I\r\nbeheld, with the eyes of a peaceful citizen, the bloody, hardened\r\nblotch and the dreadful pallor of war, and the needless terror before\r\nthat which, after all, is your own, and I felt an overwhelming\r\ndepression and sadness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO HELP?\r\n\r\n\r\n   _Catherine Kuskova is a journalist and social worker of\r\n   considerable note._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO HELP?\r\n\r\nBY CATHERINE KUSKOVA\r\n\r\n\r\nLord, what a familiar sight! How many times have we seen it during the\r\nlast nine or ten months.... And every time you blush with shame and\r\nyou have the feeling of being overcome and petrified in the face of\r\nthe incomprehensible, elemental catastrophe.\r\n\r\nThe train slowly pulls up to the high structure of the station. The\r\nscene is laid in one of the towns of the Western section. Faces of\r\npassengers, restless, way-worn, sickly, are seen in the windows. The\r\ncars are over-crowded beyond all measure. There are many black-eyed\r\nchildren, with curly black locks, and also old people, decrepit with\r\nage. The railway platform is crowded with Jewish youths, with\r\nrepresentatives of the Jewish community, and a mass of curious people\r\nwho eagerly scan the newcomers. A large crowd of passengers emerge\r\nfrom the cars rapidly and in disorder. They are Jews deported from\r\nthe zone of military operations. The local Jewish community had been\r\nnotified by a telegram and now they are meeting the newcomers.\r\n\r\nThe community has seen to it that hot tea, bread, and milk for the\r\nchildren is served to the deported right at the station. A most timely\r\nmeasure! Many of them had had no time even to take food along; they\r\nwere deported on short notice, and, besides, a family is allowed to\r\ncarry no more than forty pounds of luggage. What is forty pounds for a\r\nfamily often very large? They can hardly afford to take some underwear\r\nand warm clothes.... Behind each family there remained a home,\r\nprobably a store, a stand, a workshop or simply a sewing-machine, the\r\nsole source of income.... All are equal now in this dreadful train,\r\nwhich carries them away from home, naked wrecks of humanity, torn from\r\ntheir customary course of life and deprived of the daily toil, which\r\nfed the family. And what a terror it is to look into their eyes. It is\r\nplainly written in them: \"This is nothing, the worst is still to\r\ncome.\"\r\n\r\nThey sat down on the benches in the waiting room, and started\r\ndrinking tea, and eating.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you are feeding your spies, eh?\" suddenly remarks a porter,\r\naddressing a representative of the Jewish community. The latter grows\r\npale, shivers, and quickly moves away. What, indeed, could one answer?\r\nHow does this great migration of a people impress an unsophisticated\r\nbrain? If the entire population leaves a district the matter is clear;\r\nthe place must be evacuated before the enemy. But the trains loaded\r\nwith Jews do not come from districts already occupied by the foe. How\r\nelse can a plain man construe this fact than that the Jews are spies,\r\ndangerous people, in short, our internal enemy? And so this\r\none-year-old baby whose puffed-up, tiny hand hangs down from its\r\nmother's shoulder is also an enemy, just as is this sad girl wearily\r\nskulking in a corner, and this old man with his shaking head and\r\nwrinkled hands,--all these are our enemies, otherwise why should they\r\nhave been deported before the arrival of the foe? Why such a peculiar\r\nselection of the passengers of the dreadful trains? I go from one\r\nporter to another, asking them who was brought on. The answer is the\r\nsame: \"Jews, spies....\" The very arrival of such a train engenders an\r\nill feeling toward the entire Jewish nation,--and how many such trains\r\nhave arrived here lately! And if you were to stop and ask who\r\nestablished the guilt of these people, and whether it is thinkable\r\nthat all these tens of thousands of men, women, and children should\r\nhave been caught red-handed, no one will stop to listen to you. A Jew\r\nis a spy,--this is the only impression that becomes indelibly branded\r\nin the brains of the Russian population which witnesses the new\r\ntragedy of the Jewish nation. The effect of the passage of these\r\ntrains is truly terrible, it is a series of systematic object-lessons\r\nof hatred....\r\n\r\nWhen the crowd has quenched its hunger and thirst, a new problem\r\npresents itself: how to transport all this mass to the town and give\r\nthem shelter. For this purpose a number of carriages are kept in\r\nreadiness. The coachmen, all of them Jews, load the miserable luggage\r\nand try to accommodate the old, the sick, and the children. Now and\r\nthen a bearded, husky driver would wipe away a tear; to one side,\r\nJewish women weep frankly. The sorrowful procession sets out for the\r\ntown. There the refugees will once more have to meet the Russians and\r\nendure questionings, insulting remarks and slaps in the face.... Will\r\nthe Jewish nation stand all this?\r\n\r\nYes, it will undoubtedly stand this frightful trial. There is\r\nsomething in its inner nature that enables it to hold out under the\r\nmost terrible conditions.\r\n\r\nAt the house of a representative of the Jewish community, I find\r\nseveral people who handle the transportation and distribution of the\r\ndeported Jews.\r\n\r\n\"How many people have passed through your hands?\"\r\n\r\n\"Several thousand. We get word by telegraph from the centres of\r\ndeportation as to how many people we should keep and how many send\r\nfurther.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do you get the means necessary for these operations?\"\r\n\r\n\"The entire Jewish population of our town has imposed upon itself a\r\nsystematic refugee tax. This source furnishes us 3,000 rubles monthly.\r\nOf course this is very little, ours is a poor town. Then we get\r\nfinancial aid from the Jewish communities, which do not have to help\r\nthe deported directly. We have received several thousand rubles from\r\nSmolensk, Petrograd, Moscow, and elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how about the Russian population, does it render you any\r\nassistance?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, its attitude toward the deported is at best indifferent, and at\r\nworst hostile.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the Jews, do they not protest against this new tax?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, not in the least. You have no idea to what an extent the\r\nfeeling of solidarity grows among us in such cases. Here is an\r\ninstance. A train with the deported arrived here yesterday. It was\r\nSaturday. That is, as you know, a sacred day for the Jews.\r\nNevertheless, all our Jewish coachmen came to the station to take the\r\nnewcomers to the town. We have asked them to come to-day to get paid\r\nfor their services. Not one of them appeared. And so it has been all\r\nalong. There is not a Jewish coachman in the town who would take money\r\nin such a case. On the contrary, they would be insulted if they were\r\nnot asked to do their bit. When the first train arrived, the present\r\nself-taxation was not yet in existence. We received the telegram\r\nsuddenly. Nothing was in readiness. Our young people got busy and\r\nstarted canvassing the Jewish houses. And at once people brought all\r\nthey could: tea, sugar, eggs, milk. We met the hungry ones with full\r\nhands. No, we cannot complain against the Jews; they do all they can,\r\neven the poorest.\"\r\n\r\nThe representative shows me a heap of telegrams. Their contents are\r\nbrief: \"To Rabbi so-and-so. Meet 900; meet 1000; meet 1100.\" Only the\r\nnumbers differ....\r\n\r\n\"And where do you house those who remain here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we accommodate them in the Jewish school, in private homes, in\r\nrooms hired for the purpose. But here we met with a new obstacle. Our\r\ntown is situated on the left bank of the river Dnyepr. Now a new order\r\nwas issued to the effect that the deported should settle exclusively\r\non the left bank. We had trouble enough, I warrant you. Fortunately,\r\nthe local authorities have shown us some consideration and postponed\r\nthe second deportation.... But to entrain worn-out people and send\r\nthem anew into the unknown,--it is painful even to imagine it. Think\r\nof it: to grow accustomed to the place, to the people who take care\r\nof you,--and then again a train, a flashing of a station, and the\r\nfinal outrage of the arrival. Many say: 'Better to die than to resume\r\nour road again.'\r\n\r\n\"But we are forced to send them further, although nowadays it is hard\r\nto place the deported; all the towns are crowded, the congestion leads\r\nto diseases. Here, too, we have had several deaths....\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" I said finally, \"but you know, at least approximately, why\r\nthese people are deported? It is impossible that this should be done\r\nfor no earthly reason, simply because they happen to be Jews....\"\r\n\r\nHow great was my repentance that I put this naïve question! I shall\r\nnever, never forget the eyes which turned on me. There was in them a\r\nburning pain and another question: \"Yes, for what crime? If we only\r\nknew it.... Perhaps, you will tell us? You are a Russian, you are in a\r\nbetter position to know....\"\r\n\r\nI got up quickly, shook hands, and left in silence, with a feeling of\r\nrepulsion for myself and shame for my helplessness....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOMELESS ONES\r\n\r\n\r\n   _Sergey Yakovlevich Yelpatyevsky is a popular writer of\r\n   realistic, and humanitarian tales and sketches. In his youth he\r\n   was exiled to Siberia, and in 1910 he was imprisoned. He was born\r\n   in 1854._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOMELESS ONES\r\n\r\nBY S. YELPATYEVSKY\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nA party of Jews was brought to the province of Tavrida. Officially\r\nthey are called \"the deported\"; the newspapers refer to them as \"the\r\nhomeless ones.\" At first came three thousand Jews from the province of\r\nKovno. They were followed by Kurland Jews, and now about seven\r\nthousand Jews have been settled in the government of Tavrida. Other\r\nparties are expected....\r\n\r\nThey had wandered a long time before they reached their new place of\r\nresidence. Obviously, the authorities who handled the deportation\r\nthought only of how to get rid of the Jews, and those on whom the\r\nnewcomers were thrust had not been informed in time and did not know\r\nhow to arrange to take care of them.\r\n\r\nThe first party, three thousand strong, stayed a while at Melitopol,\r\nthen they were transported to Simferopol where they remained five\r\ndays, and were finally distributed over the towns and townlets of\r\nnorthern Crimea.\r\n\r\nIt is told that one of the parties was assigned to Yekaterinoslav, but\r\nthe authorities refused to accept the people and ordered them to\r\nproceed further. The local papers report that a group of deported Jews\r\nwas transported from Pavlograd to Jankoy, then, according to an\r\ninstruction from the Ministry of the Interior they were shipped to\r\nVoronezh....\r\n\r\nThere are many old men and women, many girls and mothers, and a large\r\nnumber of children in the party which has been brought here. All of\r\nthem are miserable and exhausted, a number are ill, either because\r\nthey had been sick when the catastrophe overtook them or because they\r\nfell ill on the way, and there are many pregnant women among them. As\r\na result of their long wanderings, wives have lost their husbands and\r\nmothers their children and they eagerly question everybody about those\r\ndear to them.\r\n\r\nLittle has been written in the newspapers about the Jews deported from\r\nthe zone of military activities, and so far little has been heard of\r\neither the state or the social organisations coming to the assistance\r\nof these \"war sufferers,\" who feel the burden of war even more heavily\r\nthan those who fled from the war-stricken districts on their own\r\naccount. There was a vague statement that the Pirogov Society is\r\naiding the Jews deported to the Government of Poltava and that meagre\r\nsums were contributed by the Union of Towns and the Ministry of the\r\nInterior,--that is all the newspapers have so far reported.\r\n\r\nThe burden of taking care of the newcomers fell entirely on the local\r\nJewish communities. It was a heavy burden, for there are no more than\r\nabout twenty thousand Jewish families in the entire government of\r\nTavrida. These twenty thousand families had to take care and to\r\nsupport seven thousand homeless people, mostly small tradesmen and\r\npeddlers who had had no time to liquidate their businesses and who\r\ncould not take along any property, for bedding was the only thing they\r\nwere allowed to carry.\r\n\r\nThey had to find housing facilities in all haste, to organise\r\ntransportation and medical aid, and to solve the food and employment\r\nproblems. An attempt was made to utilise the deported in agriculture,\r\nin which labour is nowadays exceedingly scarce in Crimea. But the old\r\npeople and the children are not fit for agricultural work and it would\r\ntake too long to train the able-bodied women. On the other hand, the\r\nlargest and more prosperous Crimean towns, such as Simferopol and\r\nSebastopol, Yalta, Yevpatoria, and Theodosia, where the deported Jews\r\ncould easily find employment, are closed to the newcomers. Only the\r\nsmaller and poorer towns and townlets where even the local Jews can\r\nscarcely get employment, are put at the disposal of the newcomers as\r\ntheir places of residence. There was even a project to settle a\r\nportion of these people in the city of Perekop. This town counts only\r\none Jewish family among its population. It consists of a prison and\r\nseveral deserted shanties, and reminds one of that legendary Siberian\r\ntown, which was made up of a single pillar erected as an indication of\r\nthe site where the city was supposed to stand.\r\n\r\nThe local Jewish communities spend about fifty thousand rubles monthly\r\non feeding the deported. This sum does not include the expenses of\r\ntransportation and housing. The local communities applied to the\r\nPetrograd Committee, but it took upon itself only fifteen thousand\r\nrubles. The remaining thirty-five thousand are contributed by the\r\nJews, who have also to support their specific cultural institutions as\r\nwell as municipal institutions of a general character.\r\n\r\nThe representatives of the Simferopol Jewish community applied to the\r\nGovernor of Tavrida for financial help. I do not know whether they\r\nwere successful. Meanwhile, other parties of deported Jews are\r\nexpected here, and how the Jews will be able to handle them, is more\r\nthan I can tell.\r\n\r\nThe War has ruined many homes and made many men, women, and children\r\nhomeless. But it would hardly be an exaggeration to say that fate has\r\nbeen most ruthless to these deported Jews. The so-called \"refugees,\"\r\nafter all, acted freely; they brought with them, if not what they\r\nwanted at least what they had time, what they were able to take; they\r\ncould go wherever there was work. The refugees were everywhere\r\nwelcomed and helped by both the authorities and the public\r\norganisations. Special days for the soliciting of donations were\r\nappointed and large sums collected. Wherever they went people tried to\r\nalleviate their sufferings. But the deportation of the Jews took place\r\nas if on the sly, without attracting any one's attention, without\r\nengaging the sympathies of the people at large to the degree which\r\nmight be expected.\r\n\r\nThe deported proved a heavy burden not only for the Jewish but also\r\nfor the Gentile population of the humble villages of the government of\r\nTavrida, which were flooded by the newcomers. The prices of food, and\r\nthe rent soared up, and competition among tradesmen and small\r\nmerchants grew more ruthless,--in a word, life here became much harder\r\nthan the War alone would have made it.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAs one observes these throngs of old men, children and pregnant women\r\nwho are deported and tossed from one end of the country to the other,\r\nsimply because they are Jews, one wonders to whom it brings profit or\r\nhappiness. It is clear that it does no one any good and no one finds\r\nthis wholesale deportation either just or necessary.\r\n\r\n\"In discussing the deportation of Jews the Minister of the Interior\r\npointed out that this measure was not justified by the actual\r\nbehaviour of the Jewish population, which is in general loyal to the\r\ncountry and cannot bear responsibility for the actions of criminal\r\nindividuals, of whom unfortunately no nationality is free\" (_Yuzhnyia\r\nVyedomosti_, No 10). The same communication contains the following\r\nstatements: \"It was asserted that the wholesale accusation of the Jews\r\nas traitors is wholly groundless.... In view of this the council of\r\nMinisters, by an overwhelming majority, decided to make intercession\r\nto put an end to the deportation of the Jews.\"\r\n\r\nWhether the Council of Ministers has interceded and whether its\r\nefforts were crowned with success,--I know not. The papers published\r\nseveral orders whereby separate groups of deported Jews were permitted\r\nto return to their former places of residence,--for instance, the\r\ndeported Galician Jews were allowed to return to Galicia,--but there\r\nwas no general rescript which would put an end to the deportation....\r\n\r\nThe wholesale deportation of the Jews caused a great perplexity among\r\nthe population of Crimea. Even people who are not over-sensitive to\r\nproblems of truth and justice and whose sympathies are far from being\r\nbroad, show signs of being stirred up. Suppose the Council of\r\nMinisters is mistaken, they say, and the presence of the Jews in the\r\ngovernments of Kovno and Kurland is really a danger for the State, but\r\nthen do not Germans live in those provinces, in even larger numbers\r\nthan Jews? Time and again we read in the newspapers of the friendly\r\nreception of the German armies by the German population of Kurland.\r\nThere were also registered cases where penalties were imposed on\r\nindividual persons who either showed too great an enthusiasm for the\r\nGerman troops or rendered them material services. Nevertheless,\r\nnothing was heard about the German population of the Government of\r\nKurland being deported in a wholesale manner,--at least, not a single\r\ntrain with Kurland Germans has reached Crimea.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand,--so thinking people keep on arguing,--if the Jews\r\nhave proved to be more German than the Germans themselves, and the\r\nTeutonic population of Kurland act like loyal Russian subjects, why\r\nthen liquidate the land owned by the Crimean Germans, who have been\r\nliving in Crimea for more than a century, who have never shown any\r\ndisloyalty to Russia, who, furthermore, are separated from the German\r\nfrontier by thousands of versts and who are, therefore, by no means\r\nable to inform the Germans from Germany about the movement of our\r\ntroops in the provinces of Kurland and Kovno.\r\n\r\nAnd once more rises the question: \"In whose interests is all this\r\ndone?\"\r\n\r\nThe matter has also another aspect. How many Jews were deported--tens\r\nor hundreds of thousands--no one knows exactly; but seeing the large\r\nmasses which are being shifted from place to place, people wonder how\r\nmany cars were necessary to transport all these throngs. And then it\r\noccurs to them that all these trains could bring in enormous cargoes\r\nof coal, sugar, kerosene and other wares which are so badly needed\r\nhere, and carry away grain and fruit, which are needed elsewhere, thus\r\nmaking life more livable in many corners of our vast country.\r\n\r\nAnd people who have the enviable capacity of not losing their\r\nequanimity under any circumstances, remark that in this fashion the\r\nJewish problem is being settled and the Pale of Settlement removed.\r\n\r\n\"Here already the provinces of Voronezh and Penza are opened to\r\nJews....

ARTZIBASHEF\r\n\r\n\r\nIt so happened that the second platoon of the third squad of the\r\nAshkadar regiment found itself completely cut off from the main body\r\nof the army, and this without the loss of a single cartridge or\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\nHow this came about, and why a group of men, fifteen or twenty strong,\r\nhad suddenly become an independent fighting unit, none of them could\r\ntell.\r\n\r\nAt the outset, the entire Ashkadar regiment zealously trudged\r\nthroughout the long autumn night along an interminable road, leading\r\nno one knew where, into the dark, damp, and hostile distance. To smoke\r\nor to converse was forbidden. In the dark, the black mass of the\r\nregiment, bristling with its bayonets like some huge, porcupine-like\r\ncreature, crawled steadily onward, filling the air with the shuffling\r\nof innumerable feet. The men kept stumbling over each other, and\r\nswore viciously in half tones; they slipped in the mud and sank\r\nknee-deep into the wheel-tracks filled with cold water. \"Some road!\"\r\nthey sighed quietly.\r\n\r\nAt dawn the regiment was brought to a halt and was stretched along the\r\nedge of a wide potato field, which the soldiers had never seen before.\r\nIt was drizzling with sickening persistence, and the dark-blue\r\ndistances, mildly sloping and mournful, were blurred in the haze of\r\nthe rain. On both sides, as far as eye could reach, ranks of grey\r\nofficers and soldiers were wretchedly soaking in the rain. Water was\r\ndripping from their sullen faces and it looked as though they were all\r\nweeping over their fate--the fate which had cast them upon this\r\nstrange, unknown, God-forsaken field. In a few hours many of them will\r\nperhaps be lying dead amidst the half-rotted potato stems on the wet\r\nsoil with their pallid faces upturned to the cold heavens, the very\r\nones which now weep also over their dear, distant country.\r\n\r\nBehind, a battery crew was vainly attempting to set the cannon which\r\nwere sinking into the soaked plough-land. One could hear the hoarse\r\nangry voices, the cracking of whips, and the heavy, strained snorting\r\nof horses. In front of them lone officers wandered in drenched cloaks\r\nin the rain; still farther behind the curtain of rain and the thick\r\nfog there rumbled cannons and it was impossible to tell whether they\r\nbelonged to the enemy or not. At times the shooting seemed to come\r\nfrom afar-off on the right. Then the rumble of the guns was deep and\r\nmuffled like the sound of heavy iron balls rolling over the ground; at\r\nother times, the discharges were quite near and rent the air with a\r\ncrash, bursting over the men's very heads, as it were.\r\n\r\nThe commander of the squad stood right in front of his men and kept\r\nlighting cigarettes shielding them with the skirts of his cloak. He\r\ndid it so often that it seemed as if he had been vainly attempting to\r\nlight the same cigarette for the last three hours. The soldiers were\r\nattentively looking at his back and were all morbidly anxious to help\r\nhim. It was cold and damp, and they felt an incessant, nauseating\r\ngnawing in the pit of the stomach. It was not fear but an indefinite\r\nanguish, a sort of _the-sooner-over-the-better_ feeling.\r\n\r\nSeveral hours passed in this manner, but towards noon it all changed\r\nabruptly. Though the sky was still as grey as before and it drizzled\r\ncontinuously, it grew lighter, the clouds in one spot became white and\r\nshining and one felt that the sun was somewhere behind them. But\r\namidst this cold white light a disquieting feeling pervaded the\r\natmosphere and the gnawing anxiety was turning into unbearable agony.\r\nSuddenly, an aide-de-camp dashed past on a horse, covered with froth\r\nand fuzzy with dampness. Officers began to scurry back and forth;\r\nsharp commands were heard; and the bugles resounded.\r\n\r\n\"Well, comrades!\" ... said some one in the ranks in a high, false tone\r\nof voice. Every one heard this exclamation and understood it, but no\r\none turned around to see where it came from. The grey mass of people\r\nsuddenly stirred, gave a sigh, surged like the sea whipped by a gale,\r\nand, sinking at each step into the mud, the entire regiment rolled\r\nforward, over the expanse of the shoreless fields which now suddenly\r\nlooked strange and dreadful. The soldiers, their faces haggard and\r\nqueer, were crossing themselves as they ran. They marched in disorder,\r\nand when they were stopped on the hill-crest, they turned the\r\nregiment into a confused mob of breathless and perplexed men. Some\r\neven forgot to lower their rifles.\r\n\r\nBefore them the hazy network of rain was still hanging and the\r\ndistances stretched, strange and hostile. But now the fields were\r\nastir with flickering pale flames and a ceaseless scattered cracking\r\nof guns. In the grey sky a small black dot was discernible, seemingly\r\nmotionless, but changing in size. When it grew larger, a faint buzzing\r\nwas heard from above and made the soldiers turn their grey, ghastly\r\nfaces upward.... Then a mighty buzzing suddenly resounded behind the\r\nregiment, and a Russian aeroplane flew over the heads of the men like\r\na drenched bird. As the aeroplane rose higher and higher, the soldiers\r\nwatched the distance between it and the small black dot far up in the\r\nsky grow smaller and smaller.\r\n\r\nVoices were now heard from the ranks and when the black dot was\r\nrapidly beginning to grow smaller, sinking, as it were, in the sky and\r\napproaching the horizon, those voices became loud and gay.\r\n\r\n\"He don't like it, what! See him run for his life! Well done! Fine\r\nfellows!\" ... was heard along the ranks.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers suddenly became lively and for a moment forgot about\r\nthemselves and the uncertain fate that was in store for them.\r\n\r\n\"Why not put you on that aeroplane, Yermilich!... You'd be quite handy\r\nat it, wouldn't you!\" the soldiers were poking fun at each other.\r\n\r\nAll at once a confused many-voiced cry and a disorderly crackling of\r\nrifles was heard ahead of them; then a crowd of soldiers came running\r\nfrom that direction, at first singly, then in groups, and finally in a\r\nmass. They belonged to another regiment of the same division. One\r\ncould discern from afar their wide-open eyes, rounded mouths, and an\r\nexpression of frantic terror on their pale faces.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the Ashkadar regiment, waving their swords and yelling\r\nsomething indistinct, were running over the washed-out field to meet\r\nthe running men, but the grey crowd momentarily knocked them down,\r\ntrampled upon them, completely covered them, and mingled itself with\r\nthe Ashkadar men. And everything that, but a while ago, was so clear\r\nand important now became confused and meaningless.\r\n\r\nLike the waters that wash off a dam pierced in but a single point,\r\neven so did the running soldiers confuse and sweep away the regiment.\r\nThe Ashkadar men themselves were partly infected by the panic and\r\nbegan to run they knew not why, apparently possessed by that\r\nmysterious power which is transmitted from man to man and which pushes\r\none from behind and compels him to run farther and farther, aimlessly\r\nand blindly.\r\n\r\nThe entire mass of men started down the slope, but having encountered\r\nthe battery with a crew yelling and waving their hands, it swerved\r\naside. Then as this mass ran into the regular line of soldiers, who\r\nwere rapidly coming to meet them, their rifles carried at charge, it\r\nthrew itself to one side, then to the other, then backwards and\r\nforwards and finally scattered over the fields, filling the air with\r\nmad outcries and disorderly shooting. It was at that very time that\r\nthe second platoon of the third squad strayed from its regiment and\r\nits officers. Seventeen in all, instinctively keeping together, they\r\nfound themselves outside of the battle-field in a narrow loamy ravine\r\novergrown with dwarfish trees. The ravine was deep and had washed-out\r\nclay slopes. High above it stretched a muddy, uneven strip of grey\r\nsky, which poured an unceasing rain upon the soaked red clay, upon the\r\nsmall wet birch trees, and the group of soldiers, who had lost their\r\nway and driven by inertia were hurrying further downward.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers, all reservists, were thick-set, bearded and pock-marked\r\npeasants from the governments of Kostroma and Novgorod and among them,\r\nwas a dark little Jew, Hershel Mak, who alone thought and planned for\r\nthe rest of them. All these country people taken right from the plough\r\nwere unable to grasp how it all happened, and were not even sure\r\nwhether anything had happened at all. They could not tell whether\r\nthere was a battle or not, whether it was good or bad to be left\r\nwithout officers in this confounded ravine, and what would come of it\r\nall. Only Hershel Mak understood that there was a battle, that the\r\nfront ranks came right under the crossfire of the machine-guns, that a\r\npanic resulted and that the Ashkadar regiment was knocked off its\r\nfeet by a crowd of runaways. He knew that the regiment was broken up\r\nwithout a shot and that now they were left to their own fate, in a\r\nplace which might well be within the very centre of the enemy's\r\nposition. Hershel Mak was well aware of the fact that for the present\r\nno one would or could worry about them and that they must alone\r\ndisentangle themselves from this mess,--and his versatile mind began\r\nat once to work to the utmost of its ability.\r\n\r\nThe rain was rushing in murmuring streams down the slopes of the\r\nravine and along its bottom, and the noise of the water drowned the\r\ncrackling of the machine-guns and the thundering of the cannon. The\r\nravine extended further down, and apparently into the forest, for the\r\ntrees were becoming thicker, and on the ground a deep layer of\r\nhalf-decayed leaves was mingled with the clay. Once or twice, a heavy\r\nbuzzing was heard overhead, and the soldiers involuntarily lifted\r\ntheir eyes, but there was no aeroplane in sight, and one could not\r\ntell whether it was the enemy or not.\r\n\r\nHershel Mak was walking behind the others, and was deep in thought.\r\n\r\n\"What are we going to do when we meet the enemy? When we were with the\r\nregiment, we knew what to do.... But we don't know the high military\r\nrules! Maybe, we shouldn't fight at all,--maybe, according to the high\r\nmilitary rules it is necessary to retreat a bit?... How is one to tell\r\nI'd like to know.\"\r\n\r\nJust then on the opposite bank of the stream which in its overflowing\r\nformed shallow muddy puddles something dark began to flicker among the\r\ntrees, and the enemy soldiers in light grey cloaks, and varnished\r\nhelmets protected with linen covers came forward. This was an enemy\r\ndetachment which had also strayed away from its regiment. A\r\nnon-commissioned officer, husky and red-bearded, was in charge of it.\r\nThe Germans' gait was also uncertain. They walked with rifles carried\r\nat charge, timidly looking about and were just going to stop to talk\r\nover their situation, when they noticed the reddish-grey cloaks and\r\nthe bayonets.\r\n\r\n\"Halt!\" yelled out a flaxen-haired Kostroma peasant.\r\n\r\nHe did it so forcefully that two crows flew off in fright and rose\r\nhigh above the ravine.\r\n\r\nHershel Mak nearly fell into the water. The red and the grey soldiers\r\nseparated by about fifty steps and a small, turbid, rain-beaten\r\nrivulet were eyeing each other with amazement rather than with terror.\r\nThin scattered cries of terror and dismay were heard from the other\r\nside, and all at once it grew still with an ominous strained\r\nstillness.\r\n\r\n\"Listen ... eh,\" ... whispered Hershel Mak, touching the gun of the\r\nKostroma reservist. But at this very moment, the soldiers as if in\r\nresponse to a command stepped back a pace or two, got down on their\r\nknees and an uneven crackling of guns rent the damp air.\r\n\r\nThe flaxen-haired Kostroma peasant and another soldier, a father of a\r\nlarge family, nick-named \"uncle,\" threw up their arms and fell heavily\r\nupon the soaked clay.\r\n\r\nThe first was killed on the spot, but as to the \"uncle,\" he clutched\r\nhis abdomen, sat up and began to howl in a thin, piercing voice:\r\n\"Bro-o-thers!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the soldiers were seized with a savage anger, immense and\r\nterrible, similar to the nervous fury with which one tramples upon a\r\nsnake. Scattered bullets began flying amidst the wet trees, and wild\r\noutcries filled the air. The bullets hissed far over the forest and\r\nsank with a swish into the clay; birch leaves, quietly circling, were\r\nfalling to the ground where three light-grey figures were writhing in\r\nconvulsions of pain and horror.\r\n\r\nThe husky non-commissioned officer was the first among these to cease\r\nstirring. He lay there with his face stuck in the cold mud of the\r\nstream. A volley of bullets, still more uneven than the first answered\r\nit, and presently single shots, interrupted by furious outcries of\r\npain, by groans of the wounded and rattling of the dying came from\r\nboth sides.\r\n\r\nPale flames flickered everywhere; the bark was being ripped from the\r\nsmall birch trees; here and there were seen ghastly distorted faces\r\nand shivering hands hurriedly fussing with the guns. The biting odour\r\nof blood and gun-powder filled the air, and a bluish smoke rose slowly\r\nto the sky, passing through the twigs shivering, as it were, with\r\nfear, and under the birches there lay two groups of men, charging\r\ntheir guns, shooting, slaying one another, and strewing the wet earth\r\nwith crippled, writhing, moaning bodies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuddenly the shooting ceased just as unexpectedly as it had begun.\r\nThere was no one upon the clearing except the wounded, and the dead.\r\nThe reddish soldiers hid behind the stones and the grey behind the\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nThe fire ceased. The hearts of the men beat rapidly and painfully with\r\na vicious inhuman terror, but no one fired a single shot. An hour\r\npassed and then another. The men lay silently behind the stones and\r\nthe trees, each group eyeing the enemy sharply and closely watching\r\ntheir slightest movements.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle\" alone, his back leaning on a trunk of a tree, was moaning\r\nplaintively and softly like a fly caught in a spider's web. And on the\r\nother side a young soldier was making severe attempts to lift up his\r\nbody out of the mud puddle, while the eyes of his pale youthful face\r\nwere already covered with the film of death. But no one paid the\r\nslightest attention to either of them. Each one felt upon himself the\r\nkeen, merciless eye of the enemy and dared not budge or even stretch\r\nout a benumbed foot. A grey soldier attempted once to change his\r\nplace, whereupon three shots thundered from the other side, and the\r\nman only turned over and remained still. Later two men were killed,\r\none on each side, and again everything grew still.\r\n\r\nThe clatter of the rain alone was heard, as though, invisible to the\r\neye, some one wept bitterly in the forest. The hours were passing, and\r\nthe nervous tension grew intolerable, assuming the intensity of agony.\r\nIt was quite apparent that things could not go on in this way much\r\nlonger, and every one knew that whoever would lift his head would be\r\nkilled on the spot. Lord only knows the odd and horrible thoughts that\r\nwere passing in these terror-stricken, muddled minds.\r\n\r\nHershel Mak felt very keenly that he was eager to live; that like the\r\nrest of these men, he had a father and mother and also his own little\r\ndesires, remote from this place and sacred to him alone. He was also\r\nsorry for \"uncle\" and for that dying German, who lay in the puddle,\r\nand who had been killed, perhaps by a bullet from \"uncle's\" rifle.\r\n\r\nThe hours were passing and the unbearable nervous horror grew, and\r\nthe inner tension, terrible and so taut that it seemed to be ready to\r\nsnap every second, was beginning to turn into a sort of nightmare,\r\nwhich makes one shiver all over, which dims one's eyes with red mist,\r\nwhich banishes all fear of death and suffering and turns all that is\r\nhuman into an elemental, savage fury.\r\n\r\nAt the very moment, when the tension reached its highest point and the\r\nnightmare was about to pass in a ruthless engagement, Hershel Mak,\r\nunable to control his strained nerves any longer began to pray\r\nplaintively in the tongue of his forefathers. \"_Shma Isroel! Shma\r\nIsroel!_\" ... His comrades did not understand him and glanced at him\r\nin terror, as at a madman, but from the opposite side another\r\nfrightened and plaintive voice answered him in Jewish: \"A Jew!... A\r\nJew!...\"\r\n\r\nHershel Mak's heart fell within him. The mad joy that took hold of him\r\nis indescribable. It was undefiled human joy that filled him to the\r\nbrim, when from the place whence he expected only death and hatred\r\nthere came familiar human words. Forgetting the deathly peril, he\r\nsprang to his knees, threw up his arms and cried out, as if responding\r\nto a voice heard in the desert.\r\n\r\n\"I!... I!...\"\r\n\r\nA shot crashed; but it was only Mak's cap, that jumped up and landed\r\nin the mud puddle. From beyond the stream and the trees a typical head\r\nwith ears projecting from under the varnished helmet looked straight\r\nat him.\r\n\r\n\"Don't shoot!... Don't shoot!\" yelled Hershel Mak in Russian, German\r\nand Jewish all at once, waving his hands frantically. And the other\r\nJew, in a long light-grey cloak was also yelling something to his\r\nfellow-soldiers. Now not one but about ten pairs of eyes looked at\r\nHershel Mak, with astonishment and sudden joy. A vague, faint hope was\r\nseen in these frightened human eyes, which suddenly became simple and\r\nsympathetic. Then Hershel Mak and the Jew in the light-grey cloak\r\nrushed to the clearing and, splashing in the water, trustingly ran to\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nThey met between the two ranks of still hostile gun-barrels and\r\nembraced each other in a fit of unreasoning human gladness.\r\n\r\n\"Are you a Jew?\" asked the grey soldier. They kept looking at each\r\nother like two old friends who met where they least expected to find\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nIn the twilight, after the soldiers gathered up their dead and\r\nwounded, they went each their own way along the ravine, now blue with\r\nthe evening fog. Those in the rear kept looking back at the enemy,\r\nsuspiciously eyeing them, and nervously clutching with their hands the\r\ncold muzzles of their guns.\r\n\r\nOnly Hershel Mak and the Jew in the light-grey cloak walked calmly.\r\nHershel chattered like a monkey, joining now one now another of the\r\nsoldiers. He was saying something about his joy, about the great\r\nmission of Judaism. But no one listened to him, and one of the\r\nsoldiers said good-naturedly: \"Go to the devil, you dirty Jew.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"BORZOI\" stands for the best in literature in all its branches--drama\r\nand fiction, poetry and art. \"BORZOI\" also stands for unusually\r\npleasing book-making.\r\n\r\nBORZOI Books are good books and there is one for every taste worthy of\r\nthe name.
