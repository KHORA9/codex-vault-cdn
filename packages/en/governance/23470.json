K.\r\nLaughton on the subject of Jenkins's Ear.  Professor Laughton, while\r\nlately making some researches in the Admiralty records, came on certain\r\ncorrespondence which appears to have escaped notice up to that time,\r\nand he regards it as incidentally confirming the story of Jenkins's\r\nEar, \"which for certainly more than a hundred years has generally been\r\nbelieved to be a fable.\"  The correspondence, in my opinion, leaves the\r\nstory exactly as it found it.  We only learn from it that Jenkins made\r\na complaint about his ear to the English naval commander at Port Royal,\r\nwho received the tale with a certain incredulity, but nevertheless sent\r\nformal report of it to the Admiralty, and addressed a remonstrance to\r\nthe Spanish authorities.  But as Jenkins told his story to every one he\r\nmet, it is not very surprising that he should have told it to the\r\nEnglish admiral.  No one doubts that a part of one of Jenkins's ears\r\nwas cut off; it will be seen in this volume that he actually at one\r\ntime exhibited the severed part; but the question is, How did it come\r\nto be severed?  It might have been cut off in the ordinary course of a\r\nscuffle with the Spanish revenue-officers who tried to search his\r\nvessel.  The point of the story is that Jenkins said the ear was\r\ndeliberately severed, and that the severed part was flung in his face,\r\nwith the insulting injunction to take that home to his king.  Whether\r\nJenkins told the simple truth or indulged in a little fable is a\r\nquestion which the recently published correspondence does not in any\r\nway help us to settle.\r\n\r\nJ.

On April 24, 1731,\r\nDaniel Defoe died.  It does not belong to the business of this history\r\nto narrate the life or describe the works of Defoe.  The book on which\r\nhis fame will chiefly rest was published just twenty years before his\r\ndeath.  \"Robinson Crusoe\" first thrilled the world in 1719.  \"Robinson\r\nCrusoe\" has a place in literature as unassailable as \"Gulliver's\r\nTravels\" or as \"Don Quixote.\"  Rousseau in his \"Émile\" declares that\r\n\"Robinson Crusoe\" should for a long time be his pupil's sole library,\r\nand that it would ever after through life be to him one of his dearest\r\nintellectual companions.  At the present time, it is said, English\r\nschool-boys do not read \"Robinson Crusoe.\"  There are laws of literary\r\nreaction in the tastes of school-boys as of older people.  There were\r\ndays when the English public did not read Shakespeare; but it was\r\ncertain that Shakespeare would come up again, and it is certain that\r\n\"Robinson Crusoe\" will come up again.  Defoe had been {2} a fierce\r\nfighter in the political literature of his time, and that was a trying\r\ntime for the political gladiator.  He had, according to his own\r\ndeclaration, been thirteen times rich and thirteen times poor.  He had\r\nalways written according to his convictions, and he had a spirit that\r\nno enemy could cow, and that no persecution could break.  He had had\r\nthe most wonderful ups and downs of fortune.  He had been patronized by\r\nsovereigns and persecuted by statesmen.  He had been fined; he had been\r\npensioned; he had been sent on political missions by one minister, and\r\nhe had been clapped into Newgate by another.  He had been applauded in\r\nthe streets and he had been hooted in the pillory.  Had he not written\r\n\"Robinson Crusoe\" he would still have held a high place in English\r\nliterature, because of the other romances that came from his teeming\r\nbrain, and because of the political tracts that made so deep and\r\nlasting an impression even in that age of famous political tracts.  But\r\n\"Robinson Crusoe\" is to his other works like Aaron's serpent, or the\r\n\"one master-passion in the breast,\" which the poet has compared with\r\nit--it \"swallows all the rest.\"  \"While all ages and descriptions of\r\npeople,\" says Charles Lamb, \"hang delighted over the adventures of\r\nRobinson Crusoe, and will continue to do so, we trust, while the world\r\nlasts, how few comparatively will bear to be told that there exist\r\nother fictitious narratives by the same writer--four of them at least\r\nof no inferior interest, except what results from a less felicitous\r\nchoice of situation.  'Roxana,' 'Singleton,' 'Moll Flanders,' 'Colonel\r\nJack,' are all genuine offsprings of the same father.  They bear the\r\nveritable impress of Defoe.  Even an unpractised midwife would swear to\r\nthe nose, lip, forehead, and eye of every one of them.  They are, in\r\ntheir way, as full of incident, and some of them every bit as romantic;\r\nonly they want the uninhabited island, and the charm, that has\r\nbewitched the world, of the striking solitary situation.\"  Defoe died\r\nin poverty and solitude--\"alone with his glory.\"  It is perhaps not\r\nuncurious to note that in the same month of the same year, 1731, on {3}\r\nApril 8th, \"Mrs. Elizabeth Cromwell, daughter of Richard Cromwell, the\r\nProtector, and granddaughter of Oliver Cromwell, died at her house in\r\nBedford Row, in the eighty-second year of her age.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1733--Gay's request]\r\n\r\nThe death of Gay followed not long after that of Defoe.  The versatile\r\nauthor of \"The Beggars' Opera\" had been sinking for some years into a\r\ncondition of almost unrelieved despondency.  He had had some\r\ndisappointments, and he was sensitive, and took them too much to heart.\r\nHe had had brilliant successes, and he had devoted friends, but a\r\nslight failure was more to him than a great success, and what he\r\nregarded as the falling-off of one friend was for the time of more\r\naccount to him than the steady and faithful friendship of many men and\r\nwomen.  Shortly before his death he wrote: \"I desire, my dear Mr. Pope,\r\nwhom I love as my own soul, if you survive me, as you certainly will,\r\nif a stone should mark the place of my grave, see these words put upon\r\nit:\r\n\r\n  \"'Life is a jest and all things show it:\r\n  I thought so once, but now I know it.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGay died in the house of his friends, the Duke and Duchess of\r\nQueensberry, on December 4, 1732.  He was buried near the tomb of\r\nChaucer in Westminster Abbey, and a monument was set up to his memory,\r\nbearing on it Pope's famous epitaph which contains the line, \"In wit a\r\nman, simplicity a child.\"  Gay is but little known to the present\r\ngeneration.  Young people or old people do not read his fables any\r\nmore--those fables which Rousseau thought worthy of special discussion\r\nin his great treatise on Education.  The gallant Captain Macheath\r\nswaggers and sings across the operatic stage no more, nor are tears\r\nshed now for pretty Polly Peachum's troubles.  Yet every day some one\r\nquotes from Gay, and does not know what he is quoting from.\r\n\r\nWalpole was not magnanimous towards enemies who had still the power to\r\ndo him harm.  When the enemy could hurt him no longer, Walpole felt\r\nanger no longer; {4} but it was not his humor to spare any man who\r\nstood in his way and resisted him.  If he was not magnanimous, at least\r\nhe did not affect magnanimity.  He did not pretend to regard with\r\ncontempt or indifference men whom in his heart he believed to be\r\nformidable opponents.  It was a tribute to the capacity of a public man\r\nto be disliked by Walpole; a still higher tribute to be dreaded by him.\r\nOne of the men whom the great minister was now beginning to hold in\r\nserious dislike and dread was Philip Dormer Stanhope, Earl of\r\nChesterfield.  Born in 1694, Chesterfield was still what would be\r\ncalled in political life a young man; he was not quite forty.  He had\r\nled a varied and somewhat eccentric career.  His father, a morose man,\r\nhad a coldness for him.  Young Stanhope, according to his own account,\r\nwas an absolute pedant at the university.  \"When I talked my best I\r\nquoted Horace; when I aimed at being facetious I quoted Martial; and\r\nwhen I had a mind to be a fine gentleman I talked Ovid.  I was\r\nconvinced that none but the ancients had common-sense; that the\r\nclassics contained everything that was either necessary, useful, or\r\nornamental to me; . . . and I was not even without thoughts of wearing\r\nthe _toga virilis_ of the Romans, instead of the vulgar and illiberal\r\ndress of the moderns.\"  Later he had been a devotee of fashion and the\r\ngambling-table, was a man of fashion, and a gambler still.  He had\r\ntravelled; had seen and studied life in many countries and cities and\r\ncourts; had seen and studied many phases of life.  He professed to be\r\ndissipated and even licentious, but he had an ambitious and a daring\r\nspirit.  He well knew his own great gifts, and he knew also and frankly\r\nrecognized the defects of character and temperament which were likely\r\nto neutralize their influence.  If he entered the House of Commons\r\nbefore the legal age, if for long he preferred pleasure to politics, he\r\nwas determined to make a mark in the political world.  We shall see\r\nmuch of Chesterfield in the course of this history; we shall see how\r\nutterly unjust and absurd is the common censure which sets him down as\r\na literary and political {5} fribble; we shall see that his speeches\r\nwere so good that Horace Walpole declares that the finest speech he\r\never listened to was one of Chesterfield's; we shall see how bold he\r\ncould be, and what an enlightened judgment he could bring to bear on\r\nthe most difficult political questions; we shall see how near he went\r\nto genuine political greatness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1733--Chesterfield's character]\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to form a secure opinion as to the real character of\r\nChesterfield.  If one is to believe the accounts of some of the\r\ncontemporaries who came closest to him and ought to have known him\r\nbest, Chesterfield had scarcely one great or good quality of heart.\r\nHis intellect no one disputed, but no one seems to have believed that\r\nhe had any savor of truth or honor or virtue.  Hervey, who was fond of\r\nbeating out fancies fine, is at much pains to compare and contrast\r\nChesterfield with Scarborough and Carteret.  Thus, while Lord\r\nScarborough was always searching after truth, loving it, and adhering\r\nto it, Chesterfield and Carteret were both of them most abominably\r\ngiven to fable, and both of them often, unnecessarily and consequently\r\nindiscreetly so; \"for whoever would lie usefully should lie seldom.\"\r\nLord Scarborough had understanding, with judgment and without wit; Lord\r\nChesterfield a speculative head, with wit and without judgment.  Lord\r\nScarborough had honor and principle, while Chesterfield and Carteret\r\ntreated all principles of honesty and integrity with such open contempt\r\nthat they seemed to think the appearance of these qualities would be of\r\nas little use to them as the reality.  In short, Lord Scarborough was\r\nan honest, prudent man, capable of being a good friend, while Lord\r\nChesterfield and Carteret were dishonest, imprudent creatures, whose\r\nprinciples practically told all their acquaintance, \"If you do not\r\nbehave to me like knaves, I shall either distrust you as hypocrites or\r\nlaugh at you as fools.\"\r\n\r\nWe have said already in this history that a reader, in getting at an\r\nestimate of the character of Lord Hervey, will have to strike a sort of\r\nbalance for himself between {6} the extravagant censure flung at him by\r\nhis enemies and the extravagant praise blown to him by his friends.\r\nBut we find no such occasion or opportunity for striking a balance in\r\nthe case of Lord Chesterfield.  All the testimony goes the one way.\r\nWhat do we hear of him?  That he was dwarfish; that he was hideously\r\nugly; that he was all but deformed; that he was utterly unprincipled,\r\nvain, false, treacherous, and cruel; that he had not the slightest\r\nfaith in the honor of men or the virtue of women; that he was silly\r\nenough to believe himself, with all his personal defects, actually\r\nirresistible to the most gifted and beautiful woman, and that he was\r\nmendacious enough to proclaim himself the successful lover of women who\r\nwould not have given ear to his love-making for one moment.  Yet we\r\ncannot believe that Chesterfield was by any means the monster of\r\nugliness and selfish levity whom his enemies, and some who called\r\nthemselves his friends, have painted for posterity.  He was, says\r\nHervey, short, disproportioned, thick, and clumsily made; had a broad,\r\nrough-featured, ugly face, with black teeth, and a head big enough for\r\na Polyphemus.  \"One Ben Ashurst, who said few good things, though\r\nadmired for many, told Lord Chesterfield once that he was like a\r\nstunted giant, which was a humorous idea and really apposite.\"  His\r\nportraits do not by any means bear out the common descriptions of his\r\npersonal appearance.  Doubtless, Court painters then, as now, flattered\r\nor idealized, but one can scarcely believe that any painter coolly\r\nconverted a hideous face into a rather handsome one and went wholly\r\nunreproved by public opinion of his time.  The truth probably is that\r\nChesterfield's bitter, sarcastic, and unsparing tongue made him\r\nenemies, who came in the end to see nothing but deformity in his person\r\nand perfidy in his heart.  It is easy to say epigrammatically of such a\r\nman that his propensity to ridicule, in which he indulged himself with\r\ninfinite humor and no distinction, and with inexhaustible spirits and\r\nno discretion, made him sought and feared, liked and not loved, by most\r\nof his acquaintance; it is easy to say that {7} no sex, no relation, no\r\nrank, no power, no profession, no friendship, no obligation, was a\r\nshield from those pointed, glittering weapons that seemed only to shine\r\nto a stander-by, but cut deep in those they touched.  But to say this\r\nis not to say all, or to paint a fair picture.  It is evident that he\r\ndelighted in passing himself off on serious and heavy people as a mere\r\ntrifler, paradox-maker, and cynic.  He invited them not to take him\r\nseriously, and they did take him seriously, but the wrong way.  They\r\nbelieved that he was serious when he professed to have no faith in\r\nanything; when he declared that he only lived for pleasure, and did not\r\ncare by what means he got it; that politics were to him ridiculous, and\r\nambition was the folly of a vulgar mind.  We now know that he had an\r\nalmost boundless political ambition; and we know, too, that when put\r\nunder the responsibilities that make or mar statesmen, he showed\r\nhimself equal to a great task, and proved that he knew how to govern a\r\nnation which no English statesman before his time or since was able to\r\nrule from Dublin Castle.  If the policy of Chesterfield had been\r\nadopted with regard to Ireland, these countries would have been saved\r\nmore than a century of trouble.  We cannot believe the statesman to\r\nhave been only superficial and worthless who anticipated in his Irish\r\npolicy the convictions of Burke and the ideas of Fox.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1733--Chesterfield's governing ability]\r\n\r\nThe time, however, of Chesterfield's Irish administration is yet to\r\ncome.  At present he is still only a rising man; but every one admits\r\nhis eloquence and his capacity.  It was he who moved in the House of\r\nLords the \"address of condolence, congratulation, and thanks\" for the\r\nspeech from the throne on the accession of George the Second.  Since\r\nthen he had served the King in diplomacy.  He had been Minister to the\r\nHague, and the Hague then was a very different place, in the\r\ndiplomatist's sense, from what it is now or is ever likely to be again.\r\nHe had been employed on special missions and had been concerned in the\r\nmaking of important treaties.  He was rewarded for his services with\r\nthe Garter, and was made Lord Steward {8} of the Household.  He had\r\ndistinguished himself highly as an orator in the House of Lords; had\r\ntaken a place among the very foremost parliamentary orators of the day.\r\nBut he chafed against Walpole's dictatorship, and soon began to show\r\nthat he was determined not to endure too much of it.  He secretly did\r\nall he could to mar Walpole's excise scheme; he encouraged his three\r\nbrothers to oppose the bill in the House of Commons.  He said witty and\r\nsarcastic things about the measure, which of course were duly reported\r\nto Walpole's ears.  Perhaps Chesterfield thought he stood too high to\r\nbe in danger from Walpole's hand.  If he did think so he soon found out\r\nhis mistake.  Walpole's hand struck him down in the most unsparing and\r\nhumiliating way.  Public affront was added to political deprivation.\r\nLord Chesterfield was actually going up the great stairs of St. James's\r\nPalace, on the day but one after the Excise Bill had been withdrawn,\r\nwhen he was stopped by an official and bidden to go home and bring back\r\nthe white staff which was the emblem of his office, of all the chief\r\noffices of the Household, and surrender it.  Chesterfield took the\r\ndemand thus ungraciously made with his usual composure and politeness.\r\nHe wrote a letter to the King, which the King showed to Walpole, but\r\ndid not think fit to answer.  The letter, Walpole afterwards told Lord\r\nHervey, was \"extremely labored but not well done.\"  Chesterfield\r\nimmediately passed into opposition, and became one of the bitterest and\r\nmost formidable enemies Walpole had to encounter.  Walpole's friends\r\nalways justified his treatment of Chesterfield by asserting that\r\nChesterfield was one of a party who were caballing against the minister\r\nat the time of the excise scheme, and while Chesterfield was a member\r\nof the Government.  Chesterfield, it was declared, used actually to\r\nattend certain private meetings and councils of Walpole's enemies to\r\nconcert measures against him.  There is nothing incredible or even\r\nunlikely in this; but even if it were utterly untrue, we may assume\r\nthat sooner or later Walpole would have got rid of Chesterfield.  {9}\r\nWalpole's besetting weakness was that he could not endure any really\r\ncapable colleague.  The moment a man showed any capacity for governing,\r\nWalpole would appear to have made up his mind that that man and he were\r\nnot to govern together.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1733--Walpole's animosity]\r\n\r\nWalpole made a clean sweep of the men in office whom he believed to\r\nhave acted against him.  He even went so far as to deprive of their\r\ncommissions in the army two peers holding no manner of office in the\r\nAdministration, but whom he believed to have acted against him.  To\r\nstrengthen himself in the House of Lords he conferred a peerage on his\r\nattorney-general and on his solicitor-general.  Philip Yorke, the\r\nAttorney-general, became Lord Hardwicke and Chief-justice of the King's\r\nBench; Charles Talbot was made Lord Chancellor under the title of Lord\r\nTalbot.  Both were men of great ability.  Hardwicke stood higher in the\r\nrank at the bar than Talbot, and in the ordinary course of things he\r\nought to have had the position of Lord Chancellor.  But Talbot was only\r\ngreat as a Chancery lawyer, and knew little or nothing of common law,\r\nand it would have been out of the question to make him Lord\r\nChief-justice.  So Walpole devised a characteristic scheme of\r\ncompromise.  Hardwicke was induced to accept the office of Lord\r\nChief-justice on the salary being raised from 3000 pounds to 4000\r\npounds, and with the further condition that an additional thousand a\r\nyear was to be paid to him out of the Lord Chancellor's salary.  This\r\ncurious transaction Walpole managed through the Queen, and the Queen\r\nmanaged to get the King to regard it as a clever device of his own\r\nmention.  It is worth while to note that the only charge ever made\r\nagainst Hardwicke by his contemporaries was a charge of avarice; he was\r\nstingy even in his hospitality, his enemies said--a great offence in\r\nthat day was to be parsimonious with one's guests; and malignant people\r\ncalled him Judge Gripus.  For aught else, his public and private\r\ncharacter were blameless.  Hardwicke was the stronger man of the two;\r\nTalbot the more subtle and {10} ingenious.  Both were eloquent pleaders\r\nand skilled lawyers, each in his own department.  Hervey says that \"no\r\none could make more of a good cause than Lord Hardwicke, and no one so\r\nmuch of a bad cause as Lord Talbot.\"  Hardwicke lived to have a long\r\ncareer of honor, and to win a secure place in English history.  Lord\r\nTalbot became at once a commanding influence in the House of Lords.\r\n\"Our new Lord Chancellor,\" the Earl of Strafford, England's nominal and\r\nornamental representative in the negotiation for the peace of Utrecht,\r\nwrites to Swift, \"at present has a great party in the House.\"  But the\r\nnew Lord Chancellor did not live long enough for his fame.  He was\r\ndestined to die within a few short years, and to leave the wool-sack\r\nopen for Lord Hardwicke.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1734--The Patriots]\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons has hardly ever been thrilled to interest and\r\nroused to passion by a more heated, envenomed, and, in the rhetorical\r\nsense, brilliant debate than that which took place on March 13, 1734.\r\nThe subject of the debate was the motion of a country gentleman, Mr.\r\nWilliam Bromley, member for Warwick, \"that leave be given to bring in a\r\nbill for repealing the Septennial Act, and for the more frequent\r\nmeeting and calling of Parliaments.\"  The circumstances under which\r\nthis motion was brought forward gave it a peculiar importance as a\r\nparty movement.  Before the debate began it was agreed, upon a formal\r\nmotion to that effect, \"that the Sergeant-at-arms attending the House\r\nshould go with the mace into Westminster Hall, and into the Court of\r\nBequests, and places adjacent, and summon the members there to attend\r\nthe service of the House.\"\r\n\r\nThe general elections were approaching; the Parliament then sitting had\r\nnearly run its course.  The Patriots had been making every possible\r\npreparation for a decisive struggle against Walpole.  They had been\r\nusing every weapon which partisan hatred and political craft could\r\nsupply or suggest.  The fury roused up by the Excise Bill had not yet\r\nwholly subsided.  Public opinion still throbbed and heaved like a sea\r\nthe morning after a storm.  {11} The Patriots had been exerting their\r\nbest efforts to make the country dissatisfied with Walpole's foreign\r\npolicy.  The changes were incessantly rung upon the alleged\r\ndepredations which the Spaniards were committing on our mercantile\r\nmarine.  Long before the time for the general elections had come, the\r\nPatriot candidates were stumping the country.  Their progress through\r\neach county was marked by the wildest riots.  The riots sometimes\r\ncalled for the sternest military repression.  On the other hand, the\r\nPatriots themselves were denounced and discredited by all the penmen,\r\npamphleteers, and orators who supported the Government on their own\r\naccount, or were hired by Walpole and Walpole's friends to support it.\r\nSo effective were some of these attacks, so damaging was the incessant\r\nimputation that in the mouths of the Patriots patriotism meant nothing\r\nbut a desire for place and pay, that Pulteney and his comrades found it\r\nadvisable gradually to shake off the name which had been put on them,\r\nand which they had at one time willingly adopted.  They began to call\r\nthemselves \"the representatives of the country interest.\"\r\n\r\nThe final struggle of the session was to take place on the motion for\r\nthe repeal of the Septennial Act.  We have already given an account of\r\nthe passing of that Act in 1716, and of the reasons which in our\r\nopinion justified its passing.  It cannot be questioned that there is\r\nmuch to be said in favor of the principle of short Parliaments, but in\r\nWalpole's time the one great object of true statesmanship was to\r\nstrengthen the power of the House of Commons; to enable it to stand up\r\nagainst the Crown and the House of Lords.  It would be all but\r\nimpossible for the House of Commons to maintain this position if it\r\nwere doomed to frequent and inevitable dissolutions.  Frequent\r\ndissolution of Parliament means frequently recurring cost, struggle,\r\nanxiety, wear and tear, to the members; and; of course, it meant all\r\nthis in much higher measure during the reign of George the Second than\r\nit could mean in the reign of Victoria.  Walpole had {12} devoted\r\nhimself to the task of strengthening the representative assembly, and\r\nhe was, therefore, well justified in resisting the motion made by Mr.\r\nBromley on March 13, 1734, for the repeal of the Septennial Act.  Our\r\ninterest now, however, is not so much with the political aspect of the\r\ndebate as with its personal character.  One illustration of the\r\ncorruption which existed at the time may be mentioned in passing.  It\r\nwas used as an argument against long Parliaments, but assuredly at that\r\nday it might have been told of short Parliaments as well.  Mr. Watkin\r\nWilliams Wynn mentioned the fact that a former member of the House of\r\nCommons, afterwards one of the judges of the Common Pleas, \"a gentleman\r\nwho is now dead, and therefore I may name him,\" declared that he \"had\r\nnever been in the borough he represented in Parliament, nor had ever\r\nseen or spoken with any of his electors.\"  Of course this worthy\r\nperson, \"afterwards one of the judges of the Common Pleas,\" had simply\r\nsent down his agent and bought the place.  \"I believe,\" added Mr. Wynn,\r\n\"I could without much difficulty name some who are now in the same\r\nsituation.\"  No doubt he could.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1734--A supposititious minister]\r\n\r\nSir William Wyndham came on to speak.  Wyndham was now, of course, the\r\nclose ally of Bolingbroke.  He hated Walpole.  He made his whole speech\r\none long denunciation of bribery and corruption, and gave it to be\r\nunderstood that in his firm conviction Walpole only wanted a long\r\nParliament because it gave him better opportunities to bribe and to\r\ncorrupt.  He went on to draw a picture of what might come to pass under\r\nan unscrupulous minister, sustained by a corrupted septennial\r\nParliament.  \"Let us suppose,\" he said, \"a gentleman at the head of the\r\nAdministration whose only safety depends upon his corrupting the\r\nmembers of this House.\"  Of course Sir William went on to declare that\r\nhe only put this as a supposition, but it was certainly a thing which\r\nmight come to pass, and was within the limits of possibility.  If it\r\ndid come to pass, could not such a minister promise himself more\r\nsuccess in a septennial than he {13} could in a triennial Parliament?\r\n\"It is an old maxim,\" Wyndham said, \"that every man has his price.\"\r\nThis allusion to the old maxim is worthy of notice in a debate on the\r\nconduct and character of Walpole.  Evidently Wyndham did not fall into\r\nthe mistake which posterity appears to have made, and attribute to\r\nWalpole himself the famous words about man and his price.  Suppose a\r\ncase \"which, though it has not happened, may possibly happen.  Let us\r\nsuppose a man abandoned to all notions of virtue and honor, of no great\r\nfamily, and of but a mean fortune, raised to be chief Minister of State\r\nby the concurrence of many whimsical events; afraid or unwilling to\r\ntrust to any but creatures of his own making, and most of these equally\r\nabandoned to all notions of virtue or honor; ignorant of the true\r\ninterest of his country, and consulting nothing but that of enriching\r\nand aggrandizing himself and his favorites.\"  Sir William described\r\nthis supposititious personage as employing in foreign affairs none but\r\nmen whose education made it impossible for them to have such\r\nqualifications as could be of any service to their country or give any\r\ncredit to their negotiations.  Under the rule of this minister the\r\norator described \"the true interests of the nation neglected, her honor\r\nand credit lost, her trade insulted, her merchants plundered, and her\r\nsailors murdered, and all these things overlooked for fear only his\r\nadministration should be endangered.  Suppose this man possessed of\r\ngreat wealth, the plunder of the nation, with a Parliament of his own\r\nchoosing, most of their seats purchased, and their votes bought at the\r\nexpense of the public treasure.  In such a Parliament let us suppose\r\nattempts made to inquire into his conduct or to relieve the nation from\r\nthe distress he has brought upon it.\"  Would it not be easy to suppose\r\nall such attempts discomfited by a corrupt majority of the creatures\r\nwhom this minister \"retains in daily pay or engages in his particular\r\ninterest by granting them those posts and places which never ought to\r\nbe given to any but for the good of the public?\"  Sir William pictured\r\nthis minister {14} pluming himself upon \"his scandalous victory\"\r\nbecause he found he had got \"a Parliament, like a packed jury, ready to\r\nacquit him at all adventures.\"  Then, glowing with his subject, Sir\r\nWilliam Wyndham ventured to suggest a case which he blandly declared\r\nhad never yet happened in this nation, but which still might possibly\r\nhappen.  \"With such a minister and such a Parliament, let us suppose a\r\nprince upon the throne, either from want of true information or for\r\nsome other reason, ignorant and unacquainted with the inclinations and\r\nthe interest of his people, weak, and hurried away by unbounded\r\nambition and insatiable avarice.  Could any greater curse befall a\r\nnation than such a prince on the throne, advised, and solely advised,\r\nby such a minister, and that minister supported by such a Parliament?\r\nThe nature of mankind,\" the orator exclaimed, \"cannot be altered by\r\nhuman laws; the existence of such a prince, of such a minister, we\r\ncannot prevent by Act of Parliament; but the existence of such a\r\nParliament, I think, we may; and, as such a Parliament is much more\r\nlikely to exist, and may do more mischief while the Septennial Law\r\nremains in force than if it were repealed, therefore I am most heartily\r\nin favor of its immediate repeal.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1734--An effective reply]\r\n\r\nThis was a very pretty piece of invective.  It was full of spirit,\r\nfire, and force.  Nobody could have failed for a moment to know the\r\noriginal of the portrait Sir William Wyndham professed to be painting\r\nfrom imagination.  It was not indeed a true portrait of Walpole, but it\r\nwas a perfect photograph of what his enemies declared and even believed\r\nWalpole to be.  Such was the picture which the _Craftsman_ and the\r\npamphleteers were painting every day as the likeness of the great\r\nminister; but it was something new, fresh, and bold to paint such a\r\npicture under the eyes of Walpole himself.  The speech was hailed with\r\nthe wildest enthusiasm and delight by all the Jacobites, Patriots, and\r\nrepresentatives of the country interest, and there is even some good\r\nreason to believe that it gave a certain secret satisfaction to some of\r\nthose who most {15} steadily supported Walpole by their votes.  But\r\nWalpole was not by any means the sort of man whom it is quite safe to\r\nvisit with such an attack.  The speech of Sir William Wyndham had\r\ndoubtless been carefully prepared, and Walpole had but a short time,\r\nbut a breathing-space, while two or three speeches were made, in which\r\nto get ready his reply.  When he rose to address the House it soon\r\nbecame evident that he had something to say, and that he was determined\r\nto give his adversary at least as good as he brought.  Nothing could be\r\nmore effective than Walpole's method of reply.  It was not to Sir\r\nWilliam Wyndham that he replied; at least it was not Sir William\r\nWyndham whom he attacked.  Walpole passed Wyndham by altogether.\r\nWyndham he well knew to be but the mouth-piece of Bolingbroke, and it\r\nwas at Bolingbroke that he struck.  \"I hope I may be allowed,\" he said,\r\n\"to draw a picture in my turn; and I may likewise say that I do not\r\nmean to give a description of any particular person now in being.\r\nIndeed,\" Walpole added, ingenuously, \"the House being cleared, I am\r\nsure no person that hears me can come within the description of the\r\nperson I am to suppose.\"  This was a clever touch, and gave a new barb\r\nto the dart which Walpole was about to fling.  The House was cleared;\r\nnone but members were present; the description applied to none within\r\nhearing.  Bolingbroke, of course, was not a member; he could not hear\r\nwhat Walpole was saying.  Then Walpole went on to paint his picture.\r\nHe supposed, \"in this or in some other unfortunate country, an\r\nanti-minister . . . in a country where he really ought not to be, and\r\nwhere he could not have been but by an effect of too much goodness and\r\nmercy, yet endeavoring with all his might and with all his art to\r\ndestroy the fountain from whence that mercy flowed.\"  Walpole depicted\r\nthis anti-minister as one \"who thinks himself a person of so great and\r\nextensive parts, and of so many eminent qualifications, that he looks\r\nupon himself as the only person in the kingdom capable of conducting\r\nthe public affairs of the nation.\" {16} Walpole supposed \"this fine\r\ngentleman lucky enough to have gained over to his party some persons of\r\nreally great parts, of ancient families, and of large fortunes, and\r\nothers of desperate views, arising from disappointed and malicious\r\nhearts.\"  Walpole grouped with fine freehand-drawing the band of\r\nconspirators thus formed under the leadership of this anti-minister.\r\nAll the band were moved in their political behavior by him, and by him\r\nsolely.  All they said, either in private or public, was \"only a\r\nrepetition of the words he had put into their mouths, and a spitting\r\nforth of the venom which he had infused into them.\"  Walpole asked the\r\nHouse to suppose, nevertheless, that this anti-minister was not really\r\nliked by any even of those who blindly followed him, and was hated by\r\nthe rest of mankind.  He showed him contracting friendships and\r\nalliances with all foreign ministers who were hostile to his own\r\ncountry, and endeavoring to get at the political secrets of English\r\nadministrations in order that he might betray them to foreign and\r\nhostile States.  Further, he asked the House to suppose this man\r\ntravelling from foreign court to court, making it his trade to betray\r\nthe secrets of each court where he had most lately been, void of all\r\nfaith and honor, delighting to be treacherous and traitorous to every\r\nmaster whom he had served and who had shown favor to him.  \"Sir, I\r\ncould carry my suppositions a great deal further; but if we can suppose\r\nsuch a one as I have pictured, can there be imagined a greater disgrace\r\nto human nature than a wretch like this?\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1734--An unstable alliance]\r\n\r\nThe ministers triumphed by a majority of 247 to 184.  Walpole was the\r\nvictor in more than the mere parliamentary majority.  He had conquered\r\nin the fierce parliamentary duel.\r\n\r\nThere is a common impression that Walpole's speech hunted Bolingbroke\r\nout of the country; that it drove him into exile and obscurity again,\r\nas Cicero's invective drove Catiline into open rebellion.  This,\r\nhowever, is not the fact.  A comparison of dates settles the question.\r\nThe debate on the Septennial Bill took place in March, 1734; {17}\r\nBolingbroke did not leave England until the early part of 1735.  The\r\nactual date of his leaving England is not certain, but Pulteney,\r\nwriting to Swift on April 29, 1735, adds in a postscript: \"Lord\r\nBolingbroke is going to France with Lord Berkeley, but, I believe, will\r\nreturn again in a few months.\"  No one could have known better than\r\nPulteney that Bolingbroke was not likely to return to England in a few\r\nmonths.  Still, although Bolingbroke did not make a hasty retreat,\r\nhistory is well warranted in saying that Walpole's powerful piece of\r\ninvective closed the door once for all against Bolingbroke's career in\r\nEnglish politics.  Bolingbroke could not but perceive that Walpole's\r\naccusations against him sank deeply into the heart of the English\r\npeople.  He could not but see that some of those with whom he had been\r\nmost closely allied of late years were impressed with the force of the\r\ninvective; not, indeed, by its moral force, but by the thought of the\r\ninfluence it must have on the country.  It may well have occurred to\r\nPulteney, for example, as he listened to Walpole's denunciation, that\r\nthe value of an associate was more than doubtful whom the public could\r\nrecognize at a glance as the original of such a portrait.  There had\r\nbeen disputes now and then already.  Bolingbroke was too much disposed\r\nto regard himself as master of the situation; Pulteney was not\r\nunnaturally inclined to believe that he had a much better understanding\r\nof the existing political conditions; he complained that Wyndham\r\nsubmitted too much to Bolingbroke's dictation.  The whole alliance was\r\nfounded on unstable and unwholesome principles; it was sure to crumble\r\nand collapse sooner or later.  There can be no question but that\r\nWalpole's invective precipitated the collapse.  With consummate\r\npolitical art he had drawn his picture of Bolingbroke in such form as\r\nto make it especially odious just then to Englishmen.  The mere\r\nsupposition that an English statesman has packed cards with a foreign\r\nenemy is almost enough in itself at any time to destroy a great career;\r\nto turn a popular favorite into an object of national distrust {18} or\r\neven national detestation.  But in Bolingbroke's case it was no mere\r\nsupposition.  No one could doubt that he had often traded on the\r\npolitical interests of his own country.  In truth, there was but little\r\nof the Englishman about him.  His gifts and his vices were alike of a\r\nforeign stamp.  Walpole was, for good or ill, a genuine sturdy\r\nEnglishman.  His words, his actions, his policy, his schemes, his\r\nfaults, his vices, were thorough English.  It was as an Englishman, as\r\nan English citizen, more than as a statesman or an orator, that he bore\r\ndown Bolingbroke in this memorable debate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1734--Bolingbroke a hurtful ally]\r\n\r\nBolingbroke must have felt himself borne down.  He did not long carry\r\non the struggle into which he had plunged with so much alacrity and\r\nenergy, with such malice and such hope.  Pulteney advised him to go\r\nback for a while to France, and in the early part of 1734 he took the\r\nadvice and went.  \"My part is over,\" he wrote to Wyndham, in words\r\nwhich have a certain pathetic dignity in them, \"and he who remains on\r\nthe stage after his part is over deserves to be hissed off.\"  His\r\ndeparture--it might almost be called his second flight--to the\r\nContinent was probably hastened also by the knowledge that a pamphlet\r\nwas about to be published by some of his enemies, containing a series\r\nof letters which had passed between him and James Stuart's secretary,\r\nafter Bolingbroke's dismissal from the service of James in 1716.  The\r\npamphlet was suppressed immediately on its appearance, but its contents\r\nhave been republished, and they were certainly not of a character to\r\nrender Bolingbroke any the less unpopular among Englishmen.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence consisted in a series of letters that passed between\r\nBolingbroke, through his secretary, and Mr. James Murray, acting on\r\nbehalf of James Stuart, from whom he afterwards received the title of\r\nEarl of Dunbar.\r\n\r\nThe letters are little more than mere recriminations.  Bolingbroke is\r\naccused of having brought about the failure of the insurrection of 1715\r\nby weakness, folly, and {19} even downright treachery.  Bolingbroke\r\nflings back the charges at the head of James's friends, and even of\r\nJames himself.  There was nothing brought out in 1734 and 1735 to\r\naffect the career and conduct of Bolingbroke which all England did not\r\nknow pretty well already.  Still, the revival of these old stories must\r\nhave seemed to Bolingbroke very inconvenient and dangerous at such a\r\ntime.  The correspondence reminded England once more that Bolingbroke\r\nhad been the agent of the exiled Stuarts in the work of stirring up a\r\ncivil war for the overthrow of the House of Hanover.  No doubt the\r\npublication quickened Bolingbroke's desire to get out of England.  But\r\nhe would have gone, in any case; he would have had to go.  The whole\r\ncabal with Pulteney had been a failure; Bolingbroke would thenceforward\r\nbe a hinderance rather than a help to the Patriots.  His counsel was of\r\nno further avail, and he only brought odium on them; indeed, his advice\r\nhad from first to last been misleading and ill-omened.  The Patriots\r\nwere now only anxious to get rid of him; Pulteney gave Bolingbroke\r\npretty clearly to understand that they wanted him to go, and he went.\r\n\r\nWalpole's speech, and the whole of the debate of which it made so\r\nstriking a feature, could not but have a powerful effect on the general\r\nelections.  Parliament was dissolved on April 10, 1734, after having\r\nnearly run the full course of seven years.  Seldom has a general\r\nelection been contested with such a prodigality of partisan fury and\r\npublic corruption.  Walpole scattered his purchase-money everywhere; he\r\nsowed with the sack and not with the hand, to adopt the famous saying\r\napplied by a Greek poetess to Pindar.  In supporting two candidates for\r\nNorfolk, who were both beaten, despite his support, he spent out of his\r\nprivate fortune at least 10,000 pounds; one contemporary says 60,000\r\npounds.  But the Opposition spent just as freely--more freely, perhaps.\r\nIt must be remembered that even so pure-minded a man as Burke has\r\ncontended that \"the charge of systematic corruption\" was less\r\napplicable, perhaps, to Walpole \"than to any other minister who ever\r\n{20} served the Crown for such a length of time.\"  The Opposition were\r\ndecidedly more reckless in their incitements to violence than the\r\nfriends of the Ministry.  The _Craftsman_ boasted that when Walpole\r\ncame to give his vote as an honorary freeman at Norwich the people\r\ncalled aloud to have the bribery oath administered to him; called on\r\nhim to swear that he had received no money for his vote.  All the\r\nefforts of the Patriots, or the representatives of the country\r\ninterest, as they now preferred to call themselves, failed to bring\r\nabout the end they aimed at.  They did, indeed, increase their\r\nparliamentary vote a little, but the increase was not enough to make\r\nany material difference in their position.  All the wit, the eloquence,\r\nthe craft, the courage, the unscrupulous use of every weapon of\r\npolitical warfare that could be seized and handled, had been thrown\r\naway.  Walpole was, for the time, just as strong as ever.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1735--Swift's opinion of Arbuthnot]\r\n\r\nWe turn aside from the movement and rush of politics to lay a memorial\r\nspray on the grave of a good and a gifted man.  Dr. Arbuthnot died in\r\nFebruary, 1735, only sixty years old.  \"Poor Arbuthnot,\" Pulteney\r\nwrites to Swift, \"who grieved to see the wickedness of mankind, and was\r\nparticularly esteemed of his own countrymen, is dead.  He lived the\r\nlast six months in a bad state of health, and hoping every night would\r\nbe his last; not that he endured any bodily pain, but as he was quite\r\nweary of the world, and tired with so much bad company.\"  Alderman\r\nBarber, in a letter to Swift a few days after, says much the same.  He\r\nis afraid, he tells Swift, that Arbuthnot did not take as much care of\r\nhimself as he ought to have done.  \"Possibly he might think the play\r\nnot worth the candle.  You may remember Dr. Garth said he was glad when\r\nhe was dying, for he was weary of having his shoes pulled off and on.\"\r\nA letter from Arbuthnot himself to Swift, written a short time before\r\nhis death, is not, however, filled with mere discontent, does not\r\nbreathe only a morbid weariness of life, but rather testifies to a\r\nserene and noble resignation.  \"I am going,\" he tells Swift, \"out {21}\r\nof this troublesome world, and you, amongst the rest of my friends,\r\nshall have my last prayers and good wishes.  I am afraid, my dear\r\nfriend, we shall never see one another more in this world.  I shall to\r\nthe last moment preserve my love and esteem for you, being well assured\r\nyou will never leave the paths of virtue and honor for all that is in\r\nthe world.  This world is not worth the least deviation from that way.\"\r\nThus the great physician, scientific scholar, and humorist awaited his\r\ndeath and died.  We have spoken already in this history of Arbuthnot's\r\nmarvellous humor and satire.  Macaulay, in his essay on \"The Life and\r\nWritings of Addison,\" says \"there are passages in Arbuthnot's satirical\r\nworks which we, at least, cannot distinguish from Swift's best\r\nwriting.\"  Swift himself spoke of Arbuthnot in yet higher terms.  \"He\r\nhas more wit than we all have,\" was Swift's declaration, \"and his\r\nhumanity is equal to his wit.\"  There are not many satirists known to\r\nmen during all literary history of whom quite so much could be said\r\nwith any faintest color of a regard for truth.  Swift was too warm in\r\nhis friendly panegyric on Arbuthnot's humor, but he did not too highly\r\nestimate Arbuthnot's humanity.  Humor is among man's highest gifts, and\r\nhas done the world splendid service; but humor and humanity together\r\nmake the mercy winged with brave actions, which, according to\r\nMassinger, befit \"a soul moulded for heaven\" and destined to be \"made a\r\nstar there.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{22}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nTHE \"FAMILY COMPACT.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1735--The Polish throne]\r\n\r\nThe new Parliament met on January 14, 1735.  The Royal intimation was\r\ngiven to the House of Commons by the Lord Chancellor that it was his\r\nMajesty's pleasure that they should return to their own House and\r\nchoose a Speaker.  Arthur Onslow was unanimously elected, or rather\r\nre-elected, to the chair he had filled with so much distinction in the\r\nformer Parliament.  The speech from the throne was not delivered until\r\nJanuary 23.  The speech was almost all taken up with foreign affairs,\r\nwith the war on the Continent, and the efforts of the King and his\r\nministers, in combination with the States General of the United\r\nProvinces, to extinguish it.  \"I have the satisfaction to acquaint\r\nyou,\" the King said, \"that things are now brought to so great a\r\nforwardness that I hope in a short time a plan will be offered to the\r\nconsideration of all the parties engaged in the present war, as a basis\r\nfor a general negotiation of peace, in which the honor and the interest\r\nof all parties have been consulted as far as the circumstances of time\r\nand the present posture of affairs would admit.\"  The Royal speech did\r\nnot contain one single word which had to do with the internal condition\r\nof England, with the daily lives of the English people.  No legislation\r\nwas promised, or even hinted at, which concerned the domestic interests\r\nof these islands.  The House of Lords set to work at once in the\r\npreparation of an address in reply to the speech from the throne; and\r\nthey, too, debated only of foreign affairs, and took no more account of\r\ntheir own fellow-countrymen than of the dwellers in Jupiter or Saturn.\r\n\r\n{23}\r\n\r\nThe war to which the Royal speech referred had been dragging along for\r\nsome time.  No quarrel could have less direct interest for the English\r\npeople than that about which the Emperor Charles the Sixth and the King\r\nof France, Louis the Fifteenth, were fighting.  On the death of\r\nAugustus the Second of Poland, in February, 1733, Louis thought it a\r\ngood opportunity for putting his own father-in-law, Stanislaus\r\nLeszczynski, back on the throne of Poland, from which he had twice been\r\ndriven.  Poland was a republic with an elective king, and a very\r\npeculiar form of constitution, by virtue of which any one of the\r\nestates or electoral colleges of the realm was in a position to stop\r\nthe action of all the others at any crisis when decision was especially\r\nneeded.  The result of this was that the elected king was always a\r\nnominee of one or another of the great Continental Powers who took it\r\non themselves to intervene in the affairs of Poland.  The election of a\r\nKing of Poland was always a mere struggle between these Powers: the\r\nstrongest at the moment carried its man.  Stanislaus, the father of\r\nLouis the Fifteenth's wife, had been a _protégé_ of Charles the Twelfth\r\nof Sweden.  He was a man of illustrious family and of great and varied\r\nabilities, a scholar and a writer.  Charles drove Augustus the Second,\r\nAugustus, Elector of Saxony, from the throne of Poland, and set up\r\nStanislaus in his place.  Stanislaus, however, was driven out of the\r\ncountry by Augustus and his friends, who rallied and became strong in\r\nthe temporary difficulties of Charles.  When Charles found time to turn\r\nhis attention to Poland he soon overthrew Augustus and set up\r\nStanislaus once again.  But \"hide, blushing glory, hide Pultowa's day\";\r\nthe fall of the great Charles came, and brought with it the fall of\r\nStanislaus.  Augustus re-entered Poland at the head of a Saxon army,\r\nand Stanislaus was compelled to abdicate.  Now that Augustus was dead,\r\nLouis the Fifteenth determined to bring Stanislaus out from his\r\nretirement of many years and set him for the third time on the Polish\r\nthrone.  On the other hand, the Emperor and Russia alike favored the\r\nson of {24} the late king, another Augustus, Elector of Saxony.  The\r\nFrench party carried Stanislaus, although at the time of his\r\nabdication, three or four and twenty years before, he had been declared\r\nincapable of ever again being elected King of Poland.  The Saxon party,\r\nsecretly backed up by Russia, resisted Stanislaus, attacked his\r\npartisans, drove him once more from Warsaw, and proclaimed Augustus the\r\nThird.  Louis of France declared war, not on Russia, but on the\r\nEmperor, alleging that the Emperor had been the inspiration and support\r\nof the Saxon movement.  A French army under Marshal Berwick, son of\r\nJames the Second of England, crossed the Rhine and took the fort of\r\nKehl--the scene of a memorable crossing of the Rhine, to be recrossed\r\nvery rapidly after, in days nearer to our own.  Spain and Sardinia were\r\nin alliance with Louis, and the Emperor's army, although led by the\r\ngreat Eugene, \"Der edle Ritter,\" was not able to make head against the\r\nFrench.  The Emperor sent frequent urgent and impassioned appeals to\r\nEngland for assistance.  George was anxious to lend him a helping hand,\r\nclamored to be allowed to take the field himself and win glory in\r\nbattle; camps and battle-fields were what he loved most, he kept\r\ndinning into Walpole's unappreciative ear.  Even the Queen was not\r\ndisinclined to draw the sword in defence of an imperilled and harassed\r\nally.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1735--The Emperor's denunciation of Walpole]\r\n\r\nWalpole stuck to his policy of masterly inactivity.  He would have\r\nwished to exclude Stanislaus from the Polish throne, but he was not\r\nwilling to go to war with France.  He could not bring himself to\r\nbelieve that the interests of England were concerned in the struggle to\r\nsuch a degree as to warrant the waste of English money and the pouring\r\nout of English blood.  But he did not take his stand on such a broad\r\nand clear position; indeed at that time it would not have been a firm\r\nor a tenable position.  Walpole did not venture to say that the\r\nquestion whether this man or that was to sit on the throne of Poland\r\nwas not worth the life of one British grenadier.  The time had not come\r\nwhen even a great minister might venture {25} to look at an\r\ninternational quarrel from such a point of view.  Walpole temporized,\r\ndelayed, endeavored to bring about a reconciliation of claims;\r\nendeavored to get at something like a mediation; carried on prolonged\r\nnegotiations with the Government of the Netherlands to induce the\r\nStates General to join with England in an offer of mediation.  The\r\nEmperor was all the time sending despatches to England, in which he\r\nbitterly complained that he had been deceived and deserted.  He laid\r\nall the blame on Walpole's head.  Pages of denunciation of Walpole and\r\nall Walpole's family are to be found in these imperial despatches.\r\nWalpole remained firm to his purpose.  He would not go to war, but it\r\ndid not suit him to proclaim his determination.  He kept up his\r\nappearance of active negotiation, and he trusted to time to settle the\r\nquestion one way or the other before King George should get too\r\nrestive, and should insist on plunging into the war.  He had many an\r\nuneasy hour, but his policy succeeded in the end.\r\n\r\nThe controversy out of which the war began was complicated by other\r\nquestions and made formidable by the rival pursuit of other ends than\r\nthose to be acknowledged in public treaty.  It would be unjust and even\r\nabsurd to suppose that Walpole's opponents believed England had a\r\ndirect interest in the question of the Polish succession, or that they\r\nwould have shed the blood of English grenadiers merely in order that\r\nthis candidate and not that should be on the throne of Poland.  What\r\nthe Opposition contended was that the alliance of France and Spain was\r\nin reality directed quite as much against England as against the\r\nEmperor.  In this they were perfectly right.  It was directed as much\r\nagainst England as against the Emperor.  Little more than forty years\r\nago a collection of treaties and engagements entered into by the\r\nSpanish branch of the Bourbon family found its way to the light of day\r\nin Madrid.  The publication was the means of pouring a very flood of\r\nlight on some events which perplexed and distracted the outer world in\r\nthe days at {26} which, in the course of this history, we have now\r\narrived.  We speak especially of the Polish war of succession and the\r\npolicy pursued with regard to it by France and Spain.  The collection\r\nof documents contained a copy of a treaty or arrangement entered into\r\nbetween the King of France and the King of Spain in 1733.  This was, in\r\nfact, the first family compact, the first of a series of family\r\ncompacts, entered into between the Bourbons in Versailles and the\r\nBourbons in Madrid.  The engagement, which in modern European history\r\nis conventionally known as \"the family compact\" between the Bourbon\r\nHouses, the compact of 1761, the compact which Burke described as \"the\r\nmost odious and formidable of all the conspiracies against the\r\nliberties of Europe that ever have been framed,\" was really only the\r\nthird of a series.  The second compact was in 1743.  The object of\r\nthese successive agreements was one and the same: to maintain and\r\nextend the possessions of the Bourbons in Europe and outside Europe,\r\nand to weaken and divide the supposed enemies of Bourbon supremacy.\r\nEngland was directly aimed at as one of the foremost of those enemies.\r\nIn the compact of 1733 the King of France and the King of Spain pledged\r\nthemselves to the interests of \"the most serene infant Don Carlos,\"\r\nafterwards for a time King of the Sicilies, and then finally King of\r\nSpain.  The compact defined the alliance as \"a mutual guarantee of all\r\nthe possessions and the honor, interests, and glory\" of the two Houses.\r\nIt was described as an alliance to protect Don Carlos, and the family\r\ngenerally, against the Emperor and against England.  France bound\r\nherself to aid Spain with all her forces by land or sea if Spain should\r\nsee fit to suspend \"England's enjoyment of commerce,\" and England\r\nshould retaliate by hostilities on the dominions of Spain, within or\r\noutside of Europe.  The French King also pledged himself to employ\r\nwithout interruption his most pressing instances to induce the King of\r\nGreat Britain to restore Gibraltar to Spain; pledged himself even to\r\nuse force for this purpose if necessary.  There were full and precise\r\n{27} stipulations about the disposition of armies and naval squadrons\r\nunder various conditions.  One article in the treaty bluntly declared\r\nthat the foreign policy of both States, France and Spain, was to be\r\n\"guided exclusively by the interests of the House.\"  The engagement was\r\nto be kept secret, and was to be regarded \"from that day as an eternal\r\nand irrevocable family compact.\"  No conspiracy ever could have been\r\nmore flagrant, more selfish, and more cruel.  The deeper we get into\r\nthe secrets of European history, the more we come to learn the truth\r\nthat the crowned conspirators were always the worst.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1735--Compact between the Houses of Bourbon]\r\n\r\nThis first family compact is the key to all the subsequent history of\r\nEuropean wars down to the days of the French Revolution.  The object of\r\none set of men was to maintain and add to the advantages secured to\r\nthem by the Treaty of Utrecht; the object of another set of men was to\r\nshake themselves free from the disadvantages and disqualifications\r\nwhich that treaty imposed on them.  The Bourbon family were possessed\r\nwith the determination to maintain the position in Spain which the will\r\nof Charles the Second had bequeathed to them, and which after so many\r\nyears of war and blood had been ratified by the Treaty of Utrecht.\r\nThey wanted to maintain their position in Spain; but they wanted not\r\nthat alone.  They wanted much more.  They wanted to plant a firm foot\r\nin Italy; they wanted to annex border provinces to France; they saw\r\nthat their great enemy was England, and they wanted to weaken and to\r\ndamage her.  No reasonable Englishman can find fault with the Kings of\r\nSpain for their desire to recover Gibraltar.  An English sovereign\r\nwould have conspired with any foreign State for the recovery of Dover\r\nCastle and rock if these were held by a Spanish invader too strong to\r\nbe driven out by England single-handed.  Many Englishmen were of\r\nopinion then, some are of opinion now, that it would be an act of wise\r\nand generous policy to give Gibraltar back to the Spanish people.  But\r\nno Englishman could possibly doubt that if England were determined to\r\nkeep Gibraltar she must {28} hold it her duty to watch with the keenest\r\nattention every movement which indicated an alliance between France and\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nSpain had at one time sought security for her interests, and a new\r\nchance for her ambitions, by alliance with the Emperor.  Of late she\r\nhad found that the Emperor generally got all the subsidies and all the\r\nother advantages of the alliance, and that Spain was left rather worse\r\noff after each successive settlement than she was before it.  The\r\nfamily compact between the two Houses of Bourbon was one result of her\r\nexperience in this way.  Of course, when we talk of France and Spain,\r\nwe are talking merely of the Courts and the families.  The people of\r\nFrance and Spain were never consulted, and, indeed, were never thought\r\nof, in these imperial and regal engagements.  Nor at this particular\r\njuncture had the King of Spain much more to do with the matter than the\r\nhumblest of his people.  King Philip the Fifth was a hypochondriac, a\r\nhalf-demented creature, almost a madman.  He was now the tame and\r\nwilling subject of the most absolute petticoat government.  His second\r\nwife, Elizabeth of Parma, ruled him with firm, unswerving hand.  Her\r\nson, Don Carlos, was heir in her right to the Duchies of Parma and\r\nPlacentia, but she was ambitious of a brighter crown for him, and went\r\ninto the war with an eye to the throne of Naples.  The Emperor soon\r\nfound that he could not hold out against the alliance, and consented to\r\naccept the mediation of England and the United Provinces.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations were long and dragging.  Many times it became apparent\r\nthat Louis on his part was only pretending a willingness to compromise\r\nand make peace in order to strengthen himself the more for the complete\r\nprosecution of a successful war.  At last a plan of pacification was\r\nagreed upon between England and Holland and at the same time the King\r\nof England entered into an alliance, offensive and defensive, with the\r\nKing of Denmark, this latter treaty, as George significantly described\r\nit in the speech from the throne, \"of great importance in {29} the\r\npresent conjuncture.\"  These engagements did not pass without severe\r\ncriticism in Parliament.  It was pointed out with effect that the\r\nnation had for some time back been engaged in making treaty after\r\ntreaty, each new engagement being described as essential to the safety\r\nof the empire, but each proving in turn to be utterly inefficacious.\r\nIn the House of Lords a dissatisfied peer described the situation very\r\nwell.  \"The last treaty,\" he said, \"always wanted a new one in order to\r\ncarry it into execution, and thus, my Lords, we have been a-botching\r\nand piecing up one treaty with another for several years.\"  The\r\nbotching and piecing up did not in this instance prevent the outbreak\r\nof the war.  The opposing forces, after long delays, at length rushed\r\nat each other, and, as was said in the speech from the throne at the\r\nopening of the session of 1736, \"the war was carried on in some parts\r\nin such a manner as to give very just apprehensions that it would\r\nunavoidably become general, from an absolute necessity of preserving\r\nthat balance of power on which the safety and commerce of the maritime\r\npowers so much depend.\"  With any other minister than Walpole to manage\r\naffairs, England would unquestionably have been drawn into the war.\r\nWalpole's strong determination and ingenious delays carried his policy\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1735--\"Bonnie Prince Charlie\"]\r\n\r\nThe war has one point of peculiar and romantic interest for Englishmen.\r\nCharles Edward Stuart, the \"bonnie Prince Charlie\" of a later date, the\r\nhero and darling of so much devotion, poetry, and romance, received his\r\nbaptism of fire in the Italian campaign under Don Carlos.  Charles\r\nEdward was then a mere boy.  He was born in the later days of 1720, and\r\nwas now about the age to serve some picturesque princess as her page.\r\nHe was sent as a volunteer to the siege of Gaeta, and was received with\r\nevery mark of honor by Don Carlos.  The English Court heard rumors that\r\nDon Carlos had gone out of his way to pay homage to the Stuart prince,\r\nand had even acted in a manner to give the impression that he\r\nidentified himself with the cause of the exiled family.  There were\r\ndemands {30} for explanation made by the English minister at the\r\nSpanish Court, and explanations were given and excuses offered.  It was\r\nall merely because of a request made by the Duke of Berwick's son, the\r\nSpanish prime-minister said.  The Duke of Berwick's son asked\r\npermission to bring his cousin Charles Edward to serve as a volunteer,\r\nand the Court of Spain consented, not seeing the slightest objection to\r\nsuch a request; but there was not the faintest idea of receiving the\r\nboy as a king's son.  King George and Queen Caroline were both very\r\nangry, but Walpole wisely told them that they must either resent the\r\noffence thoroughly, and by war, or accept the explanations and pretend\r\nto be satisfied with them.  Walpole's advice prevailed, and the boy\r\nprince fleshed his maiden sword without giving occasion to George the\r\nSecond to seek the ensanguined laurels for which he told Walpole he had\r\nlong been thirsting.  The Hanoverian kings were, to do them justice,\r\ngenerally rather magnanimous in their way of treating the pretensions\r\nof the exiled family.  We may fairly assume that the conduct of the\r\nSpanish prince in this instance did somewhat exceed legitimate bounds.\r\nGeorge was wise, however, in consenting to accept the explanations, and\r\nto make as little of the incident as the Court of Spain professed to do.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1735--Success of Walpole's policy]\r\n\r\nIncidents such as this, and the interchange of explanations which had\r\nto follow them, naturally tended to stretch out the negotiations for\r\npeace which England was still carrying on.  Again and again it seemed\r\nas if the attempts to bring about a settlement of the controversy must\r\nall be doomed to failure.  At last, however, terms of arrangement were\r\nconcluded.  Augustus was acknowledged King of Poland.  Stanislaus was\r\nallowed to retain the royal title, and was put in immediate possession\r\nof the Duchy of Lorraine, which after his death was to become a\r\nprovince of France.  The Spanish prince obtained the throne of the Two\r\nSicilies.  France was thought to have done a great thing for herself by\r\nthe annexation of Lorraine; in later times it seemed to have been an\r\nill-omened acquisition.  {31} The terms of peace were, on the whole,\r\nabout as satisfactory as any one could have expected.  Walpole\r\ncertainly had got all he wanted.  He wanted to keep England out of the\r\nwar, and he wanted at the same time to maintain and to reassert her\r\ninfluence over the politics of the Continent.  He accomplished both\r\nthese objects.  Bolingbroke said it was only Walpole's luck.  History\r\nmore truly says it was Walpole's patience and genius.\r\n\r\nDid Walpole know all this time that there was a distinct and deliberate\r\nfamily compact, a secret treaty of alliance, a formal, circumstantial,\r\nbinding agreement, consigned to written words, between France and\r\nSpain, for the promotion of their common desires and for the crippling\r\nof England's power?  Mr. J. R. Green appears to be convinced that\r\n\"neither England nor Walpole\" knew of it.  The English people certainly\r\ndid not know of it; and it is commonly taken for granted by historians\r\nthat while Walpole was pursuing his policy of peace he was not aware of\r\nthe existence of this family compact.  It has even been pleaded, in\r\ndefence of him and his policy, that he did not know that the war, in\r\nwhich he believed England to have little or no interest, was only one\r\noutcome of a secret plot, having for its object, among other objects,\r\nthe humiliation and the detriment of England.  There are writers who\r\nseem to assume it as a matter of certainty that if Walpole had known of\r\nthis family compact he would have adopted a very different course.  But\r\ndoes it by any means follow that, even if he had been all the time in\r\npossession of a correct copy of the secret agreement, he would have\r\nacted otherwise than as he did act?  Does it follow that if Walpole did\r\nknow all about it, he was wrong in adhering to his policy of\r\nnon-intervention?  A very interesting and instructive essay by\r\nProfessor Seely on the House of Bourbon, published in the first number\r\nof the _English Historical Review_, makes clear as light the place of\r\nthis first family compact in the history of the wars that succeeded it.\r\nProfessor Seely puts it beyond dispute that in every subsequent\r\nmovement of France and Spain the {32} working of this compact was made\r\napparent.  He shows that it was fraught with the most formidable danger\r\nto England.  Inferentially he seems to convey the idea that Walpole was\r\nwrong when he clung to his policy of masterly inactivity, and that he\r\nought to have intervened in the interests of England.  We admit all his\r\npremises and reject his conclusion.\r\n\r\nWalpole might well have thought that the best way to mar the object of\r\nthe conspirators against England was to keep England as much as\r\npossible out of continental wars.  He might well have thought that so\r\nlong as England was prosperous and strong she could afford to smile at\r\nthe machinations of any foreign kings and statesmen.  We may be sure\r\nthat he would not have allowed himself to be drawn away from the path\r\nof policy he thought it expedient to follow by any mere feelings of\r\nanger at the enmity of the foreign kings and statesmen.  He might have\r\nfelt as a composed and strong-minded man would feel who, quite\r\ndetermined not to sit down to the gaming-table, is amused by the\r\nsignals which he sees passing between the cheating confederates who are\r\nmaking preparations to win his money.  Besides, even if he knew nothing\r\nof the family compact, he certainly was not ignorant of the general\r\nscope of the policy of France and of Spain.  He was not a man likely at\r\nany time to put too much trust in princes or in any other persons, and\r\nwe need not doubt that in making his calculations he took into full\r\naccount the possibility of France and Spain packing cards for the\r\ninjury of England.  The existence of the family compact is a very\r\ninteresting fact in history, and enables us now to understand with\r\nperfect clearness many things that must have perplexed and astonished\r\nthe readers of an earlier day.  But, so far as the policy of Walpole\r\nregarding the war of the Polish Succession was concerned, we do not\r\nbelieve that it would have been modified to any considerable extent,\r\neven if he had been in full possession of all the secret papers in the\r\ncabinet of the King of France and the Queen of Spain.\r\n\r\n{33}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1735--Professor Seely and the secret treaty]\r\n\r\nBut is it certain that Walpole did not know of the existence of this\r\nsecret treaty?  It is certain now that if he did not know of it he\r\nmight have known.  Other English statesmen of the day did know of\r\nit--at least, had heard that such a thing was in existence, and were or\r\nmight have been forewarned against it.  Professor Seely puts it beyond\r\ndoubt that the family compact was talked of and written of by English\r\ndiplomatists at the time, was believed in by some, treated sceptically\r\nby others.  The Duke of Newcastle actually called it by the very name\r\nwhich history formally gives to the arrangement made many years after\r\nand denounced by Burke.  He speaks of \"the offensive and defensive\r\nalliance between France and Spain, called the _pacte de famille_.\"  Is\r\nit likely, is it credible, that Walpole had never heard of the\r\nexistence of a compact which was known to the Duke of Newcastle?\r\nArchdeacon Coxe, in his \"Life of Walpole,\" contends that Newcastle was\r\nnot by any means the merely absurd sort of person whom most historians\r\nand biographers delight to paint him.  \"He had a quick comprehension\r\nand was a ready debater,\" Coxe says, although without grace or style.\r\n\"He wrote with uncommon facility and great variety of expression, and\r\nin his most confidential letters, written so quickly as to be almost\r\nillegible, there is scarcely a single alteration or erasure.\"  But\r\ncertainly Newcastle was not a man likely to keep to himself the\r\nknowledge of such a fact as the family compact, or even the knowledge\r\nthat some people believed in the existence of such an arrangement.  For\r\nourselves, we are quite prepared to assume that Walpole had heard of\r\nthe family compact, but that it did not disturb his calculations or\r\ndisarrange his policy.  From some of his own letters written at the\r\ntime it is evident that he did not put any faith in the abiding nature\r\nof family compacts between sovereigns.  More than once he takes\r\noccasion to point out that where political interests interfered family\r\narrangements went to the wall.  As to the general rule Walpole was\r\nquite right.  We have seen the fact illustrated over and over again\r\neven in our {34} own days.  But Walpole appears to have overlooked the\r\nimportant peculiarity of this family compact; it was an engagement in\r\nwhich the political interests and the domestic interests of the\r\nfamilies were at last inextricably intertwined; it was a reciprocal\r\nagreement for the protection of common interests and the attainment of\r\ncommon objects.  Such a compact might be trusted to hold good even\r\namong Bourbon princes.  On the whole, we are inclined to come to the\r\nconclusion that if Walpole knew anything about the compact--and we\r\nthink he did know something about it--he was quite right in not\r\nallowing it to disturb his policy of non-intervention, but that he was\r\nnot quite sound in his judgment if he held his peaceful course only\r\nbecause he did not believe that such a family bond between members of\r\nsuch a family would hold good.  \"Tenez, prince,\" the Duc d'Aumale wrote\r\nto Prince Napoleon-Jérôme in a pamphlet which was once famous, \"there\r\nis one promise of a Bonaparte which we can always believe--the promise\r\nthat he will kill somebody.\"  One pledge of a Bourbon with another\r\nBourbon the world could always rely upon--the pledge to maintain a\r\ncommon interest and gratify a common ambition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1735--Death of Berwick]\r\n\r\nThe war cost one illustrious life, that of the brave and noble Duke of\r\nBerwick, whom Montesquieu likened to the best of the heroes of\r\nPlutarch, or rather in whom Montesquieu declared that he saw the best\r\nof Plutarch's heroes in the life.  When Bolingbroke was denouncing the\r\nset of men who surrounded James Stuart at St. Germains he specially\r\nexempted Berwick from reproach.  He spoke of Berwick as one \"who has a\r\nhundred times more capacity and credit than all the rest put together,\"\r\nbut added significantly that he \"is not to be reckoned of the Court,\r\nthough he has lodgings in the house.\"  Berwick was the natural son of\r\nJames the Second and Arabella Churchill, sister to the Duke of\r\nMarlborough.  When the day of James's destiny as King of England was\r\nover, Berwick gave his bright sword to the service of France.  He\r\nbecame a naturalized Frenchman and rose to the command {35} of the\r\nFrench army.  He won the splendid victory of Almanza over the combined\r\nforces of England and her various allies.  \"A Roman by a Roman\r\nvaliantly o'ercome,\" defeated Englishmen might have exclaimed.  He was\r\nkilled by a cannon-ball on ground not far from that whereon the great\r\nTurenne had fallen--killed by the cannon-ball which, according to\r\nMadame de Sevigne, was charged from all eternity for the hero's death.\r\nBerwick was well deserving of a death in some nobler struggle than the\r\ntrumpery quarrel got up by ignoble ambitions and selfish, grasping\r\npolicies.  He ought to have died in some really great cause; it was an\r\nage of gallant soldiers--an age, however, that brought out none more\r\ngallant than Berwick.  Of him it might fairly be said that \"his\r\nmourners were two hosts, his friends and foes.\"  This unmeaning little\r\nwar--unmeaning in the higher sense--was also the last campaign of the\r\nillustrious Prince Eugene.  Eugene did all that a general could do to\r\nhold up against overwhelming odds, and but for him the victory of the\r\nFrench would have been complete.  The short remainder of his life was\r\npassed in peace.\r\n\r\nWalpole gave satisfaction to some of those who disliked his peace\r\npolicy by the energy with which he entered into the settlement of a\r\npetty quarrel between Spain and Portugal.  The dispute turned on a\r\nmerely personal question concerning the arrest and imprisonment of some\r\nservants of the Portuguese minister at Madrid.  Walpole was eagerly\r\nappealed to by Portugal, and he took up her cause promptly.  He went so\r\nfar as to make a formidable \"naval demonstration,\" as we should now\r\ncall it, in her favor.  But he was reasonable, and he was determined\r\nthat Portugal too should be reasonable.  He recommended her to show a\r\nwillingness to come to terms, while at the same time he brought so much\r\npressure to bear on Spain that Spain at last consented to refer the\r\nwhole dispute to the arbitrament of England and France.  The quarrel\r\nwas settled, and a convention was signed at Madrid in July, 1736.  It\r\nwas a small matter, but it might at such a time have led {36} to\r\nserious and increasing complications if it had been allowed to go too\r\nfar.  Walpole unquestionably showed great judgment and firmness in his\r\nconduct, and he bore himself with entire impartiality.  Spain was in\r\nthe wrong, he thought, but not so absolutely or wilfully in the wrong\r\nas to justify Portugal in standing out for too stringent terms of\r\nreparation.  At one time it seemed almost probable that the English\r\nminister would have to employ force to coerce his own client into terms\r\nas well as the other party to the suit.  But Walpole \"put his foot\r\ndown,\" as the modern phrase goes, and the danger was averted.  Even\r\nCardinal Fleury, who co-operated with Walpole in bringing about the\r\nsettlement, thought at one time that Walpole was too strenuous and was\r\nlikely to overshoot the mark.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1736--Walpole's peace policy]\r\n\r\nEngland had troubles enough of her own and at home about this time to\r\noccupy and absorb the attention of the most devoted minister.  To do\r\nWalpole justice, it was no fault of his if the activity of English\r\nstatesmanship was compelled to engage itself rather in the composing of\r\npetty quarrels between Spain and Portugal than in any continuous effort\r\nto improve the condition of the population of these islands.  He had at\r\nleast a full comprehension of the fact that domestic prosperity has a\r\ngood deal to do with sound finance, and that sound finance depends very\r\nmuch upon a sound foreign policy.  But the utter defeat of his excise\r\nscheme had put Walpole out of the mood for making experiments which\r\nmight prove to be in advance of the age.  He had no ambition to be in\r\nadvance of his age.  He was not dispirited or disheartened; he was not\r\na man to be dispirited or disheartened, but he was made cautious.  He\r\nhad got into a frame of mind with regard to financial reform something\r\nlike that into which the younger Pitt grew in his later years with\r\nregard to Catholic emancipation: he knew what ought to be done, but\r\nfelt that he was not able to do it, and therefore shrugged his\r\nshoulders and let the world go its way.  Walpole was honestly proud of\r\nhis peace policy; more {37} than once he declared with exultation that\r\nwhile there were fifty thousand men killed in Europe during the\r\nstruggle just ended, the field of dead did not contain the body of a\r\nsingle Englishman.  Seldom in the history of England has English\r\nstatesmanship had such a tale to tell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{38}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nROYAL FAMILY AFFAIRS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1736--The Sovereign of Hanover]\r\n\r\nGeorge, and his wife Caroline Wilhelmina Dorothea, had a somewhat large\r\nfamily.  Their eldest son, Frederick Lewis, Prince of Wales and Duke of\r\nGloucester, was born on January 20, 1706.  Two other sons died, one the\r\nmoment after his birth, the other after scarcely a year of breath.\r\nWilliam Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, was born in 1721.  There were\r\nfive daughters: Anne, Amelia or Emily, Caroline, Mary, and Louisa.  The\r\nPrincess Caroline seems to have been by far the most lovable of the\r\nwhole family.  She inherited much of her mother's cleverness without\r\nher mother's coarseness.  \"Princess Caroline,\" says Lord Hervey, \"had\r\naffability without meanness, dignity without pride, cheerfulness\r\nwithout levity, and prudence without falsehood.\"  Her figure indeed is\r\none of the bright redeeming visions in all that chapter of Court\r\nhistory.  She stands out among the rough, coarse, self-seeking men and\r\nwomen somewhat as Sophy Western does among the personages of \"Tom\r\nJones.\"  Her tender inclination towards Lord Hervey makes her seem all\r\nthe more sweet and womanly; her influence over him is always apparent.\r\nHe never speaks of her without seeming to become at once more manly and\r\ngentle, strong and sweet.  Of the other princesses, Emily had perhaps\r\nthe most marked character, but there would appear to have been little\r\nin her to admire.  Hervey says of her that she had the least sense of\r\nall the family, except, indeed, her brother Frederick; and we shall\r\nsoon come to appreciate the significance of this comparison.\r\n\r\n{39}\r\n\r\nFrederick, the eldest son, like George the Second himself, had not been\r\nallowed to come to England in his early days.  The young prince was in\r\nhis twenty-second year when, on the accession of his father to the\r\nthrone, he was brought over to this country and created Prince of\r\nWales.  At that time he was well spoken of generally, although even\r\nthen it was known to every one that he was already addicted to some of\r\nthe vices of his father and his grandfather.  The Court of Hanover was\r\nnot a good school for the training of young princes.  The sovereign of\r\nHanover was a positive despot, both politically and socially.\r\nEverything had to be done to please him, to amuse him, to conciliate\r\nhim.  The women around the Court were always vying with each other to\r\nsee who should most successfully flatter the King, or, in the King's\r\nabsence, the Royal Prince.  It was intellectually a very stupid Court.\r\nIts pleasures were vulgar, its revels coarse, its whole atmosphere\r\nheavy and sensuous.  Frederick was said, however, to have given some\r\nevidence of a more cultivated taste than might have been expected of a\r\nHanoverian Crown Prince.  He was said to have some appreciation of\r\nletters and music.  When he settled in London he very soon began to\r\nfollow the example of his father and his grandfather; he threw his\r\nhandkerchief to this lady and to that, and the handkerchief was in\r\ncertain cases very thankfully taken up.  Some people said that he\r\nentered on this way of life not so much because he really had a strong\r\npredilection for it as because he thought it would be unbecoming of the\r\nposition of a Prince of Wales not to have an adequate number of women\r\nfavorites about him; so he maintained what seemed to him the dignity of\r\nhis place in society and in the State.\r\n\r\nThe prince's character at his first coming over, says Hervey in his\r\npleasantest vein, though little more respectable, seemed much more\r\namiable than, upon his opening himself further and being better known,\r\nit turned out to be; for, though there appeared nothing in him to be\r\n{40} admired, yet there seemed nothing in him to be hated--neither\r\nanything great nor anything vicious; his behavior was something that\r\ngained one's good wishes though it gave one no esteem for him.  If his\r\nbest qualities prepossessed people in his favor, yet they always\r\nprovoked contempt for him at the same time; for, though his manners\r\nwere stamped with a good deal of natural or habitual civility, yet his\r\nhabit of cajoling everybody, and almost in an equal degree, made what\r\nmight have been thought favors, if more sparingly bestowed, lose all\r\ntheir weight.  \"He carried this affectation of general benevolence so\r\nfar that he often condescended below the character of a prince; and, as\r\npeople attributed this familiarity to popular and not particular\r\nmotives, so it only lessened their respect without increasing their\r\ngood-will, and, instead of giving them good impressions of his\r\nhumanity, only gave them ill ones of his sincerity.  He was indeed as\r\nfalse as his capacity would allow him to be, and was more capable in\r\nthat walk than in any other, never having the least hesitation, from\r\nprinciple or fear of future detection, of telling any lie that served\r\nhis present purpose.  He had a much weaker understanding and, if\r\npossible, a more obstinate temper than his father; that is, more\r\ntenacious of opinions he had once formed, though less capable of ever\r\nforming right ones.  Had he had one grain of merit at the bottom of his\r\nheart, one should have had compassion for him in the situation to which\r\nhis miserable poor head soon reduced him, for his case in short was\r\nthis: he had a father that abhorred him, a mother that despised him,\r\nsisters that betrayed him, a brother set up against him, and a set of\r\nservants that neglected him, and were neither of use nor capable of\r\nbeing of use to him, nor desirous of being so.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1736--Resolved on a marriage]\r\n\r\nThe King's eldest daughter, Anne, was married soon after Frederick's\r\ncoming to England.  Up to the age of twenty-four she had remained\r\nunmarried, a long time for a princess to continue a spinster.  Many\r\nyears before, she had had a good chance of marrying Louis the Fifteenth\r\n{41} of France.  George was anxious for the marriage; the Duc de\r\nBourbon, then minister to Louis, had originated the idea; Anne was only\r\nsixteen years old, and would no doubt have offered no objection.  But\r\nthe scheme fell through because when it was well on its way somebody\r\nsuddenly remembered, what every one might have thought of before, that\r\nif the English princess became Queen of France she would be expected to\r\nconform to the religion of the State.  Political rather than religious\r\nconsiderations made this settle the matter in the English Court.\r\nGeorge and Caroline had certainly no prejudices themselves in favor of\r\none form of religion over another, or of any form of religion over\r\nnone; but, as they held the English Crown by virtue of their at least\r\nprofessing to be Protestants, and as the Pretender would most assuredly\r\nhave got that Crown if he had even professed to be a Protestant, it did\r\nnot seem possible that they could countenance a change of Church on the\r\npart of their daughter.  Years passed away and no husband was offering\r\nhimself to Anne.  Now at last she was determined that she would wait no\r\nlonger.  Suddenly the Prince of Orange was induced to ask her to be his\r\nwife.  She had never seen him; he was known to be ugly and deformed;\r\nKing George was opposed to the proposition, and told his daughter that\r\nthe prince was the ugliest man in Holland.  Anne was determined not to\r\nrefuse the offer; she said she would marry him if he were a Dutch\r\nbaboon.  \"Very well,\" retorted the King, angrily; \"you will find him\r\nbaboon enough, I can tell you.\"\r\n\r\nThe princess persevered, however; she was as firmly resolved to get\r\nmarried as Miss Hoyden in Vanbrugh's \"Relapse.\"  The King sent a\r\nmessage to Parliament announcing the approaching marriage of his\r\ndaughter to the Prince of Orange, and graciously intimating that he\r\nexpected the House of Commons to help him to give the princess a\r\nmarriage-portion.  The loyal Commons undertook to find eighty thousand\r\npounds, although George was surely rich enough to have paid his\r\ndaughter's dowry out {42} of his own pocket.  George, however, had not\r\nthe remotest notion of doing anything of the kind.  The Bill was run\r\nthrough the House of Commons in a curious sort of way, the vote for the\r\ndowry being thrown in with a little bundle of miscellaneous votes, as\r\nif the House of Commons were rather anxious to keep it out of public\r\nsight, as indeed they probably were.  The bridegroom came to England in\r\nNovember, 1732, and began his career in this country by falling very\r\nill.  It took him months to recover, and it was not until March 24,\r\n1733, that the marriage was celebrated.  It must have been admitted by\r\nAnne that her father had not misrepresented the personal appearance of\r\nthe Prince of Orange.  The Queen shed abundance of tears at the sight\r\nof the bridegroom, and yet could not help sometimes bursting into a fit\r\nof laughter at his oddity and ugliness.  Anne bore her awkward position\r\nwith a sort of stolid composure which was almost dignity.  To add to\r\nthe other unsatisfactory conditions of the marriage, the prophets of\r\nevil began to point to the ominous conjuncture of names--an English\r\nprincess married to a Prince of Orange.  When this happened last, what\r\nfollowed?  The expulsion of the father-in-law by the son-in-law.  Go\r\nto, then!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1736--Massachusetts Bay retaliates]\r\n\r\nOn the same day on which the House of Commons voted the grant of the\r\nprincess's dowry, a memorial from the council and representatives of\r\nthe colony or province of Massachusetts Bay, in New England, was\r\npresented and read from the table.  The memorial set forth that the\r\nprovince was placed under conditions of difficulty and distress owing\r\nto a royal instruction given to the governor of the province\r\nrestraining the emission of its bills of credit and restricting the\r\ndisposal of its public money.  The memorial, which seems to have been\r\ncouched in the most proper and becoming language, prayed that the House\r\nwould allow the agent for the province to be heard at the bar, and that\r\nthe House, if satisfied of the justice of the request, would use its\r\ninfluence with the King in order that he might be graciously pleased to\r\nwithdraw {43} the instructions as contrary to the rights of the charter\r\nof Massachusetts Bay, and tending in their nature to distress if not to\r\nruin the province.  The House of Commons treated this petition with the\r\nmost sovereign contempt.  After a very short discussion, if it could\r\neven be called a discussion, the House passed a resolution declaring\r\nthe complaint \"frivolous and groundless, a high insult upon his\r\nMajesty's Government, and tending to shake off the dependency of the\r\nsaid colony upon this kingdom, to which by law and right they are and\r\nought to be subject.\"  The petition was therefore rejected.  To the\r\nshort summary of this piece of business contained in the parliamentary\r\ndebates the comment is quietly added, \"We shall leave to future ages to\r\nmake remarks upon this resolution, but it seems not much to encourage\r\ncomplaints to Parliament from any of our colonies in the West Indies.\"\r\nNot many ages, not many years even, had to pass before emphatic comment\r\non such a mode of dealing with the complaints of the American colonies\r\nwas made by the American colonists themselves.  Massachusetts Bay took\r\nsterner measures next time to make her voice heard and get her wrongs\r\nredressed.  Just forty years after the insulting and contemptuous\r\nrejection of the petition of Massachusetts Bay, the people of Boston\r\nspilled the stores of tea into Boston harbor, and two years later still\r\n\"the embattled farmer,\" as Emerson calls him, stood up to the British\r\ntroops at Lexington, in Massachusetts, and won the battle.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, May 30th, the second reading of the Bill for the\r\nprincess's dowry came on in the House of Lords.  Several of the peers\r\ncomplained warmly of the manner in which the grant to the princess had\r\nbeen stuck into a general measure disposing of various sums of money.\r\nIt was a Bill of items.  There was a sum of 500,000 pounds for the\r\ncurrent service of the year.  There was 10,000 pounds by way of a\r\ncharity \"for those distressed persons who are to transport themselves\r\nto the colony of Georgia.\"  There was a vote for the repairing of an\r\nold church, and there {44} were other votes of much the same kind; and\r\namid them came the item for the dowry of the Royal Princess.  The Earl\r\nof Winchelsea complained of this strange method of huddling things\r\ntogether, and declared it highly unbecoming to see the grant made \"in\r\nsuch a hotch-potch Bill--a Bill which really seems to be the sweepings\r\nof the other House.\"  The Earl of Crawford declared it a most indecent\r\nthing to provide the marriage-portion of the Princess Royal of England\r\nin such a manner; \"it is most disrespectful to the royal family.\"  The\r\nDuke of Newcastle could only say in defence of the course taken by the\r\nGovernment that he saw nothing disrespectful or inconvenient in the\r\nmanner of presenting the vote.  Indeed, he went on to argue, or rather\r\nto assert, for he did not attempt to argue, that it was the only way by\r\nwhich such a provision could have been made.  It could not well have\r\nbeen done by a particular Bill, he said, because the marriage was not\r\nas yet fully concluded.  But the resolution of the House of Commons was\r\nthat out of the money then remaining in the receipt of the Exchequer\r\narisen by the sale of the lands in the island of St. Christopher's his\r\nMajesty be enabled to apply the sum of 80,000 pounds for the\r\nmarriage-portion of the Princess Royal.  What possible difficulty there\r\ncould be about the presenting of that resolution in the form of a\r\nseparate Bill, or how such a form of presentation could have been\r\naffected by the fact that the marriage had not yet actually been\r\nconcluded, only a brain like that of the Duke of Newcastle could\r\nsettle.  Of course the Bill was passed; each noble lord who criticised\r\nit was louder than the other in declaring that he had not the slightest\r\nnotion of opposing it.  \"I am so fond,\" said the Earl of Winchelsea,\r\n\"of enabling his Majesty to provide a sufficient marriage-portion for\r\nthe Princess Royal that I will not oppose this Bill.\"  There was much\r\nexcuse for being fond of providing his Majesty in this instance, seeing\r\nthat the money was not to be found by the tax-payers.  Probably the\r\ntrue reason why the grant was asked in a manner which would not be {45}\r\nthought endurable in our days, was that the Government well knew the\r\nKing himself cared as little about the marriage as the people did, and\r\nwere of opinion that the more the grant was huddled up the better.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1736--A projected double alliance]\r\n\r\nWe get one or two notes about this time that seem to have a forecast of\r\nlater days in them.  An explosion of some kind takes place in\r\nWestminster Hall while all the courts of justice were sitting.  No\r\ngreat harm seems to have been done, but the event naturally startled\r\npeople, and was instantly regarded as evidence of a Jacobite plot to\r\nassassinate somebody; it was not very clear who was the particular\r\nobject of hatred.  Walpole wrote to his brother, telling him of the\r\nexplosion, and adding, \"There is no reason to doubt that the whole\r\nthing was projected and executed by a set of low Jacobites who talked\r\nof setting fire to the gallery built for the marriage of the Princess\r\nRoyal\" by means of \"a preparation which they call phosphorus, that\r\ntakes fire by the air.\"  About the same time, too, we hear of an\r\noutbreak of anti-Irish riots in Shoreditch and other parts of the east\r\nend of London.  The \"cry and complaint\" of the anti-Irish was, as\r\nWalpole described the matter, that they were underworked and starved by\r\nIrishmen.  Numbers of Irishmen, it would seem, were beginning to come\r\nover to this country, not merely to labor in harvesting in the rural\r\ndistricts, as they had long been accustomed to do, but undertaking work\r\nof all kinds at lower wages than English workmen were accustomed to\r\nreceive.  \"The cry is, Down with the Irish,\" Walpole says; and Dr.\r\nSheridan, Swift's correspondent, proclaiming in terms of humorous\r\nexaggeration his desire to get out of Cavan, protests that, failing all\r\nother means of relief, \"I will try England, where the predominant\r\nphrase is, Down with the Irish.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge had at one time set his heart upon a double alliance between his\r\nfamily and that of King Frederick William of Prussia.  The desire of\r\nGeorge was that his eldest son, Frederick, should marry the eldest\r\ndaughter of the Prussian King, and that the Prussian King's eldest {46}\r\nson should marry George's second daughter.  The negotiation, however,\r\ncame to nothing.  The King of Prussia was prevailed upon to make\r\nobjections to it by those around him who feared that he might be\r\nbrought too much under the influence of England; and, indeed, it is\r\nsaid that he himself became a little afraid of some possible\r\ninterference with his ways by an English daughter-in-law.  The only\r\ninterest the project has now is that it put the two kings into bad\r\nhumor with each other.  The bad humor was constantly renewed by the\r\nquarrels arising out of the King of Prussia's rough, imperious way of\r\nsending recruiting parties into Hanover to cajole or carry off gigantic\r\nrecruits for his big battalions.  So unkingly did the disputation at\r\nlast become that George actually sent a challenge to Frederick William,\r\nand Frederick William accepted it.  A place was arranged where the\r\nroyal duellists, each crossing his own frontier for the purpose, were\r\nto meet in combat.  The wise and persistent opposition of a Prussian\r\nstatesman prevailed upon Frederick to give up the idea, and George too\r\nsuffered himself to be talked into something like reason.  It is almost\r\na pity for the amusement of posterity that the duel did not come off.\r\nIt would have almost been a pity, if the fight had come off, that both\r\nthe combatants should not have been killed.  The King of Prussia and\r\nthe King of England were, it may safely be said, the two most coarse\r\nand brutal sovereigns of the civilized world at the time.  The King of\r\nPrussia was more cruel in his coarseness than the King of England.  The\r\nKing of England was more indecent in his coarseness than the King of\r\nPrussia.  For all their royal rank, it must be owned that they were\r\n_arcades ambo_--that is, according to Byron's translation, \"blackguards\r\nboth.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1736--Following the ways of his ancestors]\r\n\r\nThe fight, however, did not come off, and George had still to find a\r\nwife for his eldest son.  She was found in the person of the Princess\r\nAugusta, sister of the Duke of Saxe-Gotha.  The duke gave his consent;\r\nthe princess offered no opposition, and indeed would not have been {47}\r\nmuch listened to if she had had any opposition to offer.  King George\r\nwished his son to get married to anybody rather than remain longer\r\nunmarried; and the prince, who had tried to make a runaway match with a\r\nyoung English lady before this time, appeared to be absolutely\r\nindifferent on the subject.  So the Princess Augusta was brought over\r\nto Greenwich, and thence to London, and on April 28, 1736, the marriage\r\ntook place.  The princess seems to have been a very amiable,\r\naccomplished, and far from unattractive young woman.  The Prince of\r\nWales grew to be very fond of her, and to be happy in the home she made\r\nhim.  He continued, of course, to follow the ways of his father and his\r\ngrandfather, and had his mistresses as well as his wife.  The Prince of\r\nWales would probably have thought he was not acting properly the part\r\nof royalty if he had been contented with the companionship of one\r\nwoman, and that woman his wife.  His wife had to put up with the palace\r\nmanners of the period.  Frederick had at one time been noted for his\r\ndutiful ways to his mother; but more lately the mother and son had\r\nbecome hopelessly estranged.  George hated Frederick, and the hatred of\r\nthe mother for the son seemed quite as strong as that of the father.\r\n\r\nA courtly chronicler and genealogist, writing at a period a little\r\nlater, describes George the Second as in the height of glory, a just\r\nand merciful prince, but dryly adds, \"He resembles his father in his\r\ntoo great attachment to the electoral dominions.\"  So indeed he did.\r\nThe whole policy of his reign was affected or controlled by his love\r\nfor Hanover, or, at least, his love for his own interest in Hanover.\r\nHe had no patriotic or unselfish attachment to the land of his ancestry\r\nand his birth; he was incapable of feeling any such exalted emotion.\r\nBut the electoral dominions, which were his property, he clung to with\r\nardor, and Hanover was the garden of the pleasures he enjoyed most\r\nhighly.  He never could understand English ways.  He once scolded an\r\nEnglish nobleman, the Duke of Grafton, for his delight in the hunting\r\nfield.  It was a {48} pretty occupation, the King said, for a man of\r\nthe duke's years, and of his rank, to spend so much of his time in\r\ntormenting a poor fox, that was generally a much better beast than any\r\nof those that pursued him; for the fox hurts no other animal but for\r\nhis subsistence, while the brutes who hurt the fox did it only for the\r\npleasure they took in hurting.  One might admire such a declaration if\r\nit could be thought to come from a too refined and sensitive humanity.\r\nAn eccentric, but undoubtedly benevolent, member of the House of\r\nCommons declared, in a speech made in that House some years ago, that\r\nhe only once joined in a hunt, and then it was only in the interest of\r\nthe fox.  George had no such feeling; he simply could not understand\r\nthe tastes or the sports of English country life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1736--To Hanover at all hazards]\r\n\r\nGeorge came back from an expedition to Hanover in a very bad humor.  He\r\nhated everything in England; he loved everything in Hanover.  It was\r\nwith the uttermost reluctance that he dragged himself back from the\r\nplace of his amusements and his most cherished amours.  He had lately\r\nfound in Hanover a new object of adoration.  This was a Madame\r\nWalmoden, a fashionable young married woman, with whom George had\r\nfallen headlong into love.  He wrote home to his wife, telling her of\r\nhis admiration for Madame Walmoden, and describing with some minuteness\r\nthe lady's various charms of person.  He induced Madame\r\nWalmoden--probably no great persuasion was needed--to leave her husband\r\nand become the mistress of a king.  George, it is said, paid down the\r\nnot very extravagant sum of a thousand dollars to make things pleasant\r\nall round.  During his stay in Hanover he and his new companion behaved\r\nquite like a high-Dutch Antony and Cleopatra.  They had revels and\r\norgies of all kinds in the midst of a crowd of companions as refined\r\nand intellectual as themselves.  George had paintings made of some of\r\nthese scenes, with portrait likenesses of those who took a leading part\r\nin them, and these paintings he brought home to England, and was\r\naccustomed {49} to exhibit and explain to the Queen, or to anybody else\r\nwho happened to be in the way.  But he did not as yet venture to bring\r\nMadame Walmoden to England; and his having to part with her threw him\r\ninto a very bad temper.  The curious reader will find an amusing, but\r\nat the same time very painful, account of the manner in which George\r\nvented his temper by snubbing his children and insulting his wife.  The\r\nQueen bore it all with her wonted patience.  George had made a promise\r\nto get back to Hanover very soon to see his beloved Madame Walmoden.\r\nWalpole restrained him for a long time, which made the King more and\r\nmore angry.  Once, when the Queen was urging him to be a little more\r\nconsiderate in his dealings with some of the bishops, the King of\r\nEngland, Defender of the Faith, told her he was sick of all that\r\nfoolish stuff, and added, \"I wish with all my heart that the devil may\r\ntake all your bishops, and the devil take your minister, and the devil\r\ntake the Parliament, and the devil take the whole island, provided I\r\ncan get out of it and go to Hanover.\"  Caroline herself could be sharp\r\nenough in her tone with the bishops sometimes, but the manners of the\r\nKing seemed to her to go beyond the bounds of reason.\r\n\r\nThe King was determined to get back to Hanover by a certain date.\r\nWalpole swore to some of his friends that the King should not go.  The\r\nKing did go, however, and left the Queen to act as regent of the\r\nkingdom during his absence.  This time George was to be absent from his\r\nwife on his birthday, and the poor Queen took this bitterly to heart.\r\nShe consulted Walpole, and Walpole was frank, although on this\r\nparticular occasion he does not seem to have been coarse.  He reminded\r\nthe Queen that she was ceasing to be young and attractive, and, as it\r\nwas necessary that she must keep a hold over the King's regard, he\r\nstrongly urged her to write to George and ask him to bring Madame\r\nWalmoden over to England with him.  Even this the Queen, after some\r\nmoments of agonized mental struggle, consented to do.  She wrote to the\r\n{50} King, and she began to make preparations for the suitable\r\nreception of the new sultana.  She carried her complacency so far as\r\neven to say that she would be willing to take Madame Walmoden into her\r\nown service.  Even Walpole thought this was carrying humbleness too\r\nfar.  \"Why not?\" poor Caroline asked; was not Lady Suffolk, a former\r\nmistress of the King, in the Queen's employment?  Walpole pointed out,\r\nwith the worldly good-sense which belonged to him, that public opinion\r\nwould draw a great distinction between the scandal of the King's making\r\none of the Queen's servants his mistress and the Queen's taking one of\r\nthe King's mistresses into her service.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1736--Handelists and anti-Handelists]\r\n\r\nThe quarrels between the Prince of Wales and the other members of the\r\nroyal family kept on increasing in virulence.  The prince surrounded\r\nhimself with the Patriots, and indeed openly put himself at their head.\r\nThe King and Queen would look at no one who was seen in the\r\ncompanionship of the prince.  The Queen is believed to have at one time\r\ncherished some schemes for separating the Electorate of Hanover from\r\nthe English Crown, in order that Hanover might be given to her second\r\nson.  With the outer public the Prince of Wales seems to have been\r\npopular in a certain sense, perhaps for no other reason than because he\r\nwas the Prince of Wales and not the King.  When he went to one of the\r\ntheatres he was loudly cheered, and he took the applause with the\r\ngratified complacency of one who knows he is receiving nothing that he\r\nhas not well deserved.  He would appear to have been continually\r\nposturing and attitudinizing as the young favorite of the people.  The\r\ntruth is that the people in general knew very little about the prince,\r\nand knew a good deal about the King, and naturally leaned to the side\r\nof the man who might at least turn out to be better than his father.\r\n\r\nEven the seraphic realms of music were invaded by the dispute between\r\nthe adherents of the King and the adherents of the prince.  The King\r\nand Queen were supporters {51} of Handel, the prince was against the\r\ngreat composer.  The prince in the first instance declared against\r\nHandel because his sister Anne, the Princess of Orange, was one of\r\nHandel's worshippers, therefore a great number of the nobility who\r\nsided with the prince set up, or at least supported, a rival\r\nopera-house to that in which Handel's music was the great attraction.\r\nThe King and Queen, Lord Hervey tells, were as much in earnest on this\r\nsubject as their son and daughter, though they had the prudence to\r\ndisguise it, or to endeavor to disguise it, a little more.  They were\r\nboth Handelists, \"and sat freezing constantly at his empty Haymarket\r\nopera, whilst the prince, with all the chief of the nobility, went as\r\nconstantly to that of Lincoln's Inn Fields.\"  \"The affair,\" Hervey\r\nadds, \"grew as serious as that of the Greens and the Blues under\r\nJustinian at Constantinople; an anti-Handelist was looked upon as an\r\nanti-courtier, and voting against the Court in Parliament was hardly a\r\nless remissible or more venial sin than speaking against Handel or\r\ngoing to the Lincoln's Inn Fields Opera.\"  Hervey was a man of some\r\nculture and some taste; it is curious to observe how little he thought\r\nof the greatest musician of his time, one of the very greatest\r\nmusicians of all time.  The London public evidently could not have been\r\ngifted with very high musical perception just then.  Indeed, later on,\r\nwhen Handel brought out his \"Messiah,\" it was met with so cold and\r\nblank a reception in London that the composer began to despair of the\r\nEnglish public ever appreciating his greatest efforts.  He made up his\r\nmind to try his \"Messiah\" in Ireland.  He went to Dublin, and there\r\nfound a splendid reception for his masterpiece, and he remained there\r\nuntil the echo of his great success had made itself heard in England,\r\nand he then came back and found his welcome in London.  This, however,\r\nis anticipating.  At present we are only concerned with the fact, as\r\nillustrating the existing condition of things in London, that to be an\r\nadmirer of Handel was to be an enemy of the Prince of Wales, and not to\r\nbe an {52} admirer of Handel was to be an enemy of the King.  The feud\r\nran so high that the Princess Royal said she expected in a little while\r\nto see half the House of Lords playing in the orchestra in their robes\r\nand coronets.  She herself quarrelled with the Lord Chamberlain for\r\npreserving his usual neutrality on this occasion, and she spoke of Lord\r\nDelaware, who was one of the chief managers against Handel, \"with as\r\nmuch spleen as if he had been at the head of the Dutch faction who\r\nopposed the making her husband Stadtholder.\"  It seems needless to say\r\nthat George himself had no artistic appreciation of Handel.  He\r\nsubscribed one thousand a year to enable Handel to fight his battle,\r\nbut he talked over the matter with unenthusiastic prosaic common-sense.\r\nHe said he \"did not think setting one's self at the head of a faction\r\nof fiddlers a very honorable occupation for people of quality, or the\r\nruin of one poor fellow so generous or so good-natured a scheme as to\r\ndo much honor to the undertakers, whether they succeeded in it or not;\r\nbut, the better they succeeded in it, the more he thought they would\r\nhave reason to be ashamed of it.\"  There were some gleams of manhood\r\nshining through George still, and he could appreciate fair play\r\nalthough he could not quite appreciate Handel.  For the ruin of one\r\npoor fellow!  The poor fellow was Handel.  The faction of fiddlers that\r\ncould ruin that poor fellow had not been found in the world, even if we\r\nwere to include Nero himself among the number.  One poor fellow!  We\r\nwonder how many sovereigns living in George's time the world could have\r\nspared without a pang of regret if by the sacrifice it could secure for\r\nmen's ennobling delight the immortal music of Handel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1736--William Pitt]\r\n\r\nOn April 29, 1736, an event of importance took place in the House of\r\nCommons; the event was a maiden speech, the speech was the opening of a\r\ngreat career.  The orator was a young man, only in his twenty-eighth\r\nyear, who had just been elected for the borough of Old Sarum.  The new\r\nmember was a young officer of {53} dragoons, and his name was William\r\nPitt.  Pitt attached himself at once to the fortunes of the Patriot, or\r\ncountry, party, and was very soon regarded as the most promising of\r\nPulteney's young recruits.  His maiden speech was spoken of and written\r\nof by his friends as a splendid success, as worthy of the greatest\r\norator of any age.  Probably the stately presence, the magnificent\r\nvoice, and the superb declamation of the young orator may account for\r\nmuch of the effect which his first effort created, for in the report of\r\nthe speech, such as it has come down to us, there is little to justify\r\nso much enthusiasm; but that the maiden speech was a signal success is\r\nbeyond all doubt.  A study of the history of the House of Commons will,\r\nhowever, make it clear, that there is little guarantee, little omen\r\neven, for the future success of a speaker in the welcome given to his\r\nmaiden speech.  Over and over again has some new member delighted and\r\nthrilled the House of Commons by his maiden speech, and never delighted\r\nit or thrilled it any more.  Over and over again has a new member\r\nfailed in his maiden speech, failed utterly and ludicrously, and turned\r\nout afterwards to be one of the greatest debaters in Parliament.  Over\r\nand over again has a man delivered his maiden speech without creating\r\nthe slightest impression of any kind, good or bad, so that when he sits\r\ndown it is, as Mr. Disraeli put it, hardly certain whether he has lost\r\nhis Parliamentary virginity or not; and a little later on the same man\r\nhas the whole House trembling with anxiety and expectation when he\r\nrises to take part in a great debate.  On the whole, it is probable\r\nthat the chances of the future are rather in favor of the man who fails\r\nin his maiden speech.  At all events, there is as little reason to\r\nassume that a man is about to be a success in the House of Commons\r\nbecause he has made a successful maiden speech as there would be to\r\nassume that a man is to be a great poet because he has written a\r\ncollege prize poem.  The friends of young William Pitt, however, were\r\nwell justified in their expectations; and the magic of {54} presence,\r\nvoice, and action, which led to an exaggerated estimate of the merits\r\nof the speech, threw the same charm over the whole of Pitt's great\r\ncareer as an orator in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1736--Pitt--Pulteney]\r\n\r\nPitt came of a good family.  His grandfather was the Governor of Madras\r\nto whom Mary Wortley Montagu more than once alludes: the \"Governor\r\nPitt\" who was more famous in his diamonds than in himself, and whose\r\nmost famous brilliant, the Pitt diamond, was bought by the Regent Duke\r\nof Orleans to adorn the crown of France.  William Pitt was a younger\r\nson, and was but poorly provided for.  A cornet's commission was\r\nobtained for him.  The family had the ownership of some parliamentary\r\nboroughs, according to the fashion of those days and of days much later\r\nstill.  At the general election of 1734 William Pitt's elder brother\r\nThomas was elected for two constituencies, Okehampton and Old Sarum.\r\nWhen Parliament met, and the double return was made known to it, Thomas\r\nPitt decided on taking his seat for Okehampton, and William Pitt was\r\nelected to serve in Parliament for Old Sarum.  He soon began to be\r\nconspicuous among the young men--the \"boy brigade,\" who cheered and\r\nsupported Pulteney.  William Pitt was from almost his childhood\r\ntortured with hereditary gout, but he had fine animal spirits for all\r\nthat, and he appears to have felt from the first a genuine delight in\r\nthe vivid struggles of the House of Commons.  He began to outdo\r\nPulteney in the vehemence and extravagance of his attacks on the policy\r\nand the personal character of the ministers.  His principle apparently\r\nwas that whatever Walpole did must _ipso facto_ be wrong, and not\r\nmerely wrong, but even base and criminal.  Walpole was never very\r\nscrupulous about inflicting an injury on an enemy, especially if the\r\nenemy was likely to be formidable.  He deprived William Pitt of his\r\ncommission in the army.  Thereupon Pitt was made Groom of the\r\nBedchamber to the Prince of Wales.  When the address was presented to\r\nthe King on the occasion of the prince's marriage with the Princess of\r\n{55} Saxe-Gotha, it was Pulteney, leader of the Opposition, and not\r\nWalpole, the head of the Government, who moved its adoption.  It was in\r\nthis debate that William Pitt delivered that maiden speech from which\r\nso much was expected, and which was followed by so many great orations\r\nand such a commanding career.  As yet, however, William Pitt is only\r\nthe enthusiastic young follower of Pulteney, whom men compare with, or\r\nprefer to, other enthusiastic young followers of Pulteney.  Even those\r\nwho most loudly cried up his maiden speech could have had little\r\nexpectation of what the maturity of that career was to bring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{56}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE PORTEOUS RIOTS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1736--The gin riots]\r\n\r\nA good deal of disturbance and tumult was going on in various parts of\r\nthe provinces.  Some of our readers have probably not forgotten the\r\nriots which took place in the early part of the present reign, in\r\nconsequence of the objection to the turnpike gate system, and in which\r\nthe rioters took the name of \"Rebecca and her daughters.\"  Riots almost\r\nprecisely similar in origin and character, but much more extensive and\r\nserious, were going on in the western counties during the earlier years\r\nof George the Second's reign.  The rioting began as early as 1730, and\r\nkept breaking out here and there for some years.  The rioters assembled\r\nin various places in gangs of about a hundred.  Like \"Rebecca and her\r\ndaughters,\" they were usually dressed in women's clothes; they had\r\ntheir faces blackened; they were armed with guns and swords, and\r\ncarried axes, with which to hew down the obnoxious turnpike gates.  The\r\ncounty magistrates, with the force at their disposal, were unable at\r\none time to make any head against the rioters.  The turnpike gates were\r\nundoubtedly a serious grievance, and at that time there was hardly any\r\nidea of dealing with a grievance but by the simple process of\r\nimprisoning, suppressing, or punishing those who protested too loudly\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\nThe Gin riots were another serious disturbance to social order.\r\nGin-drinking had grown to such a height among the middle classes in\r\ncities that reformers of all kinds took alarm at it.  A Bill was\r\nbrought into Parliament by Sir Joseph Jekyll, the Master of the Rolls,\r\nin 1736, for the purpose of prohibiting the sale of gin, or at least\r\nlaying so heavy a duty on it as to put it altogether out of {57} the\r\nreach of the poor, and absolutely prohibiting its sale in small\r\nquantities.  The Bill was not a ministerial measure, and indeed Walpole\r\nseems to have given it but a cool and half-hearted approval, and the\r\nPatriots vehemently opposed it as an unconstitutional interference with\r\nindividual habits and individual rights.  The Bill, however, passed\r\nthrough Parliament and was to come into operation on the 29th of the\r\nfollowing September.  At first it appears to have created but little\r\npopular excitement; but as the time drew near when the Act was to come\r\ninto operation, and the poorer classes saw themselves face to face with\r\nthe hour that was to cut them off from their favorite drink, a sudden\r\ndiscontent flashed out in the form of wide-spread riot.  Only the most\r\nenergetic action on the part of the authorities prevented the\r\ndiscontent from breaking into wholesale disturbance.\r\n\r\nIt does not seem as if the Gin Act did much for the cause of sobriety.\r\nPublic opinion among the populace was too decidedly against it to allow\r\nof its being made a reality.  Gin was every day sold under various\r\nnames, and, indeed, it was publicly sold in many shops under its own\r\nname.  The Gin Act called into existence an odious crew of common\r\ninformers who used to entrap people into the selling and drinking of\r\ngin in order to obtain their share of the penalty, or, perhaps, in some\r\ncases to satisfy a personal spleen.  The mob hated the common informers\r\nas bitterly as a well-dressed crowd at a race-course in our own time\r\nhates a \"welsher.\"  When the informer was got hold of by his enemies he\r\nwas usually treated very much after the fashion in which the welsher is\r\nhandled to-day.\r\n\r\nIt would be needless to say that the Gin Act and the agitation\r\nconcerning it called also into existence a whole literature of\r\npamphlets, ballads, libels, and lampoons.  The agitation ran its course\r\nduring some two years, more than once threatened to involve the country\r\nin serious disturbance, and died out at last when the legislation which\r\nhad caused so much tumult was quietly allowed to become a dead letter.\r\n\r\n{58}\r\n\r\nSuddenly Edinburgh became the theatre of a series of dramatic events\r\nwhich made her, for the moment, the centre of interest to the political\r\nworld.  It is, perhaps, a sufficient proof of the delicate condition of\r\nthe relations between the two countries that the arrest of two\r\nsmugglers came within measurable distance of awaking civil war.  These\r\ntwo smugglers, Wilson and Robertson, being under sentence of death,\r\nmade, while in church under armed escort, a desperate effort to escape.\r\nWilson, a man of great strength, by holding two soldiers with his hand,\r\nand a third with his teeth, gave Robertson the chance, which he gladly\r\nseized, of plunging into the crowd of the dispersing congregation, and\r\nvanishing into space.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1736--John Porteous]\r\n\r\nThe Edinburgh magistrates, alarmed at the escape, offended by the\r\ndisplay of popular sympathy with the escaped smuggler, and fearing,\r\nnot, as it was said, without good cause, that an attempt would be made\r\nto rescue the single-minded and not unheroic Wilson, resolved to take\r\nall possible precautions to insure the carrying out of the sentence of\r\nthe law.  To do this the more effectively they ordered out nearly the\r\nwhole of their own city guard under the command of Captain Porteous,\r\nand in doing so made one of the greatest mistakes recorded in their\r\nannals.\r\n\r\nCaptain John Porteous was in his way and within his sphere a remarkable\r\nman.  He belonged to that large crew of daring, resolute, and\r\nunscrupulous adventurers who, under happy conditions, become famous\r\nfree companions, are great in guerilla wars, make excellent explorers,\r\nand even found colonies and lay the foundations of States, but who,\r\nunder less auspicious stars, are only a terror to the peaceable and an\r\nexample to the law-abiding.  To the romancist, to the dramatist, the\r\ncharacter of such a man as John Porteous is intensely attractive; even\r\nin the graver ways of history he claims the attention imperatively, and\r\nstands forward with a decisive distinctness that lends to him an\r\nimportance beyond his deserts.  {59} His life had been from the\r\nbeginning daring, desperate, and reckless.  He was the son of a very\r\nrespectable Edinburgh citizen, who was also a very respectable tailor,\r\nand whose harmless ambition it was to make the wild slip of his blood a\r\nrespectable tailor in his turn.  Never was the saying \"Like father,\r\nlike son\" more astonishingly belied.  Young John Porteous would have\r\nnothing to do with the tailor's trade.  He was dissipated, he was\r\ndevil-may-care; there was nothing better to be done with him than to\r\nship him abroad into the military service of some foreign State, the\r\nfacile resource in those days for getting rid of the turbulent and the\r\ntroublesome.  John Porteous went into foreign service; he entered the\r\ncorps known as the Scotch-Dutch, in the pay of the States of Holland,\r\nand plied the trade of arms.\r\n\r\nTime went on, and in its course it brought John Porteous back to\r\nEdinburgh.  Here his military training served the city in good stead\r\nduring the Jacobite rising of 1715.  He disciplined the city guard and\r\ngot his commission as its captain.  But, if wanderings and foreign\r\nservice had turned the tailor's son into a stout soldier, they had in\r\nno degree mended his morality or bettered his reputation.  Edinburgh\r\ncitizenship has always been commended for keeping a strict eye to the\r\nrespectabilities, and the standard of public and private decorum was\r\nheld puritanically high in the middle of the last century; but even in\r\nthe most loose-lived of European cities, even in the frankest freedom\r\nof barracks or of camp, John Porteous, if his reputation did not belie\r\nhim, might have been expected to hold his own among the profligate and\r\nthe brutal.  It seems to be uncertain whether he was the more\r\nremarkable for his savage temper or for the dissolute disorder of his\r\nlife.  Naturally enough, perhaps in obedience to that law of contrast\r\nwhich seems so often to preside over the destinies of such men, his\r\nappearance did not jump with his nature.  We read that he was of\r\nsomewhat portly habit, by no means tall; that his face was rather\r\nbenign than otherwise, and that his eyes suggested a sleepy {60}\r\nmildness.  Such as he was, he had lived a queer, wild life, but its\r\nqueerest and its wildest scenes were now to come in swift succession\r\nbefore the end.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1736--Scene at an execution]\r\n\r\nThe city guard, of which Porteous was the commander, were scarcely more\r\npopular than their chief.  Ferguson, the luckless tavern-haunting poet,\r\nthe François Villon of Edinburgh, the singer whose genius some critics\r\nbelieve to be somewhat unfairly overshadowed by the greater fame of\r\nBurns, has branded them to succeeding generations as \"black banditti.\"\r\nThey were some 120 in number; they were composed of veteran soldiers,\r\nchiefly Highlanders; they were considered by such of the Edinburgh\r\npopulation as often came into conflict with them to be especially\r\nferocious in their fashion of preserving civic order.  Captain John\r\nPorteous seems to have found them men after his own heart, to have been\r\nvery proud of them, and to have considered that they and he together\r\nwere equal to coping with any emergency that a disturbed Edinburgh\r\nmight present.  He was therefore deeply affronted when the magistrates,\r\nafter according to him and his men the duty of guarding the scaffold on\r\nwhich Wilson was to die, considered it necessary for the further\r\npreservation of peace and the overawing of any possible attempt at\r\nrescue to order a regiment of Welsh fusileers to be drawn up in the\r\nprincipal street of the city.  Wrath at the escape of Robertson, and\r\nindignation at the slight which he conceived to be put upon him and his\r\nmen, acting upon his old hatred for his enemies, the Edinburgh mob,\r\nseems to have whipped the fierce temper of Porteous into wholly\r\nungovernable fury.  The execution took place under peculiarly painful\r\nconditions.  Porteous insisted on inflicting needless torture upon the\r\nunhappy Wilson by forcing upon his wrists a pair of handcuffs that were\r\nmuch too small for the purpose.  When Wilson remonstrated, and urged\r\nthat the pain distracted his thoughts from those spiritual reflections\r\nwhich were now so peremptory, Porteous is said to have replied with\r\nwanton ruffianism that such reflections would matter very {61} little,\r\nsince Wilson would so soon be dead.  The prisoner is reported to have\r\nanswered with a kind of prophetic dignity that his tormentor did not\r\nknow how soon he might in his turn have to ask for himself the mercy\r\nwhich he now refused to a fellow-being.  With these words, almost the\r\nlatest on his lips, the smuggler went to his death and met it with a\r\ndecent courage.\r\n\r\nWhile the execution took place no signs were shown on the part of the\r\ngreat crowd that had assembled of any desire to rescue the prisoner.\r\nBut the sentence had hardly been carried out when the temper of the mob\r\nappeared to change.  Stones were thrown, angry cries were raised, and\r\nthe mob, as if animated by a common purpose, began to press around the\r\nscaffold.  One man leaped upon the gibbet and cut the rope by which the\r\nbody was suspended; others gathered round as if to carry off the body.\r\nThen it is asserted that Porteous completely lost his head.  The\r\npassion that had been swaying him all day entirely overmastered him.\r\nHe is said to have snatched a musket from the hands of the soldier\r\nnearest to him, to have yelled to his men to fire, and to have shown\r\nthe example by pointing his own piece and shooting one of the crowd\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nWhether Porteous gave the order or not, it is certain that the attack\r\nupon the gibbet was followed by a loose fire from the guard which\r\nkilled some six or seven persons and wounded many others.  Then\r\nPorteous made an attempt to withdraw his men, and as they were moving\r\nup the High Street the now infuriated mob again attacked, and again the\r\nguards fired upon the people, and again men were killed and wounded.\r\nThus, as it were, fighting his way, Porteous got his men to their\r\nguard-house.\r\n\r\nThe popular indignation was so great that the Edinburgh authorities put\r\nPorteous upon his trial.  Porteous defended himself vigorously, denied\r\nthat he had ever given an order to fire, denied that he had ever fired\r\nhis piece, proved that he had exhibited his piece to the magistrates\r\nimmediately after the occurrence unused and still loaded.  This defence\r\nwas met by the counter-assertion {62} that the weapon Porteous had used\r\nwas not his own, but one seized from the hands of a soldier.  A large\r\nnumber of persons gave evidence that they heard Porteous give the order\r\nto fire, that they saw him level and discharge the piece he had seized,\r\nand that they had seen his victim fall.  After a lengthy trial Porteous\r\nwas found guilty and sentenced to death.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1736--Attacking the Tolbooth]\r\n\r\nThe sentence was received with practically general approval in\r\nEdinburgh, but with very different feelings in London.  The Queen, who\r\nwas acting as regent in the absence of George II., felt especially\r\nstrongly upon the subject.  Lamentable as the violence of Captain\r\nPorteous had been, it was still urged that he had acted in obedience to\r\na sense of duty.  It was feared, too, that the sufficiently lawless\r\nattitude of the lower population of Edinburgh towards authority would\r\nbe gravely and dangerously intensified if so signal an example were to\r\nbe made of an officer whose offence was only committed under conditions\r\nof grave provocation and in the face of an outbreak which might well\r\nappear to resemble riot.  The Government in London came to the\r\nconclusion that it would not do to hang John Porteous, and a message\r\nwas sent by the Duke of Newcastle notifying her Majesty's pleasure that\r\nPorteous should have a reprieve for a period of six weeks--a\r\npreliminary step to the consequent commutation of the death sentence.\r\n\r\nBut, if the Government in London proposed to reprieve Porteous, the\r\nwild democracy of Edinburgh were not willing to lose their vengeance so\r\nlightly.  The deaths caused by the discharge of the pieces of\r\nPorteous's men had aroused the most passionate resentment in Edinburgh.\r\nMen of all classes, those directly affected by the deaths of friends\r\nand relatives, and those who looked upon the quarrel from an attitude\r\nof unconcerned justice, alike agreed in regarding Porteous's sentence\r\nas righteous and deserved; now, alike, they agreed in resenting the\r\ninterference of the Queen, and the apparently inevitable escape of\r\nPorteous from the consequences of his crime.\r\n\r\n{63}\r\n\r\nWhat followed fills one of the most dramatic of all the many dramatic\r\npages in the history of Edinburgh town.  John Porteous was imprisoned\r\nin the Tolbooth, in the very thick of the city.  Some of his friends,\r\nstirred by fears which if vague were not imaginary, urged him to\r\npetition to the authorities to be removed to the Castle, perched safe\r\naloft upon its rock.  But Porteous, filled with a false security, and\r\nrejoicing in the reprieve that had arrived from London, took no heed of\r\nthe warnings.  Perhaps, like the Duke of Guise on something of a like\r\noccasion, he would, if warned that there was any thought of taking his\r\nlife, have answered, secure in the sanctity of the old Tolbooth, in the\r\nhistoric words, \"They would not dare.\"  Porteous remained in the old\r\nTolbooth; he gave an entertainment in honor of his reprieve to certain\r\nprivileged friends; he was actually at supper, with the wine going\r\nround and round, and his apartment noisy with talk and laughter, when\r\nthe jailer entered the room with a pale face and a terrible tale.  Half\r\nEdinburgh was outside the Tolbooth, armed and furious, their one demand\r\nfor the person of Porteous, their one cry for his life.\r\n\r\nThe tale was strange enough to seem incredible even to minds more sober\r\nthan those of Porteous and his companions, but it was perfectly true.\r\nEdinburgh had risen in the most mysterious way.  From all parts of the\r\ntown bands of men had come together; the guard-house of the city guard\r\nhad been seized upon, the guards disarmed, and their weapons\r\ndistributed among the conspirators.  In a very short space of time\r\nEdinburgh was in the hands of an armed and determined mob; the\r\nmagistrates, who attempted to enforce their authority, were powerless,\r\nand the crowd, with a unanimity which showed how well their plans had\r\nbeen preconcerted, directed all their energies to effecting an entrance\r\ninto the Tolbooth.  This proved at first exceedingly difficult.  The\r\ngreat gate seemed to defy the force of all the sledge-hammer strokes\r\nthat could be rained against it, and its warders were obstinate alike\r\nto the demands and the threats of the besiegers.  But some {64} one in\r\nthe ranks of the besiegers suggested fire, and through fire the\r\nTolbooth fell.  Fagots were piled outside the great gate and lighted,\r\nand the bonfire was assiduously fed until at last the great gate was\r\nconsumed and the rioters rushed to their purpose over the glowing\r\nembers and through the flying sparks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1736--A \"respectable\" mob]\r\n\r\nThey found Porteous in his apartment, deserted by his companions, dizzy\r\nwith the fumes of wines, and helpless with the horror of the doom that\r\nmenaced him.  He might perhaps have escaped when the first alarm was\r\nsounded, but, as he lost his head before through passion, so he seems\r\nto have lost it again now through dismay.  The poor wretch had indeed\r\nat the last moment, when it was too late, sought refuge in the chimney\r\nof his room; his flight was stopped by a grating a little way up; to\r\nthis grating he clung, and from this grating he was plucked away by his\r\nassailants.  In a few moments he was carried into the open air, was\r\nborne, the bewildered, despairing, struggling centre of all that armed\r\nand merciless mass, swiftly towards the Netherbow.  In the midst of the\r\nblazing torches, the Lochaber axes, the guns and naked swords, that\r\nhemmed him in, the helpless, hopeless victim was swept along.  A rope\r\nwas readily found, but a gibbet was not forthcoming; a byer's pole\r\nserved at the need.  Within a little while after the forcing of the\r\nTolbooth gate, Porteous was hanged and dead, and his wild judges were\r\nstriking at his lifeless body with their weapons.  It is said, and we\r\nmay well believe it, that Porteous died, when he found that he had to\r\ndie, bravely enough, as became a soldier.  In that wild, mad life of\r\nhis he had faced many perils, and if he pleaded for his life with his\r\nself-ordained executioners while there was any chance that pleading\r\nmight prevail, it is likely enough that he accepted the inevitable with\r\ncomposure.  Wilson was avenged; the victims of the fusillade of the\r\ncity guard had been atoned for by blood, and Edinburgh had asserted\r\nwith a ferocity all her own that England's will was not her will, and\r\nEngland's law not her law.\r\n\r\n{65}\r\n\r\nThe peculiar characteristics of the crowd that battered down the\r\nTolbooth gate and carried off Porteous to his death in the Grassmarket\r\nwere its orderliness, its singleness of purpose, and the curious\r\n\"respectability,\" if such a term may be employed, of its composition.\r\nIts singleness of purpose and its orderliness were alike exemplified by\r\nthe way in which it went about its grim business and by the absolute\r\nabsence of all riot or pillage of any kind, or indeed of any sort of\r\nviolence beyond that essential to the carrying out of its intent.  No\r\npeaceable persons were molested; no buildings other than the Tolbooth\r\nwere broken into; the very rope which hanged the unhappy Porteous was\r\nimmediately and amply paid for.  No one except the central victim of\r\nthe conspiracy received harm at the hands of the mob.  The\r\n\"respectability\" of a large proportion of the mob and of those\r\ncontrolling its actions was afterwards vouched for in many ways.\r\nLadies told tales of their carriages being stopped by disguised\r\nindividuals of courteous bearing and marked politeness, who with the\r\nmost amiable apologies turned their horses' heads from the scene of\r\naction.  It was afterwards reported and commonly believed that the\r\nEdinburgh authorities knew more about the purpose of the self-appointed\r\nexecutions than was consonant with a due regard for law and order.  In\r\nfact, if the passions of the mob were aroused they were undoubtedly\r\norganized, directed, and held in check by those who knew well how to\r\ncommand, and to give to an illegal act the gravity and decorum of\r\nlegality.\r\n\r\nNews travelled slowly in those days.  There were no telegrams, no\r\nspecial editions, no newspapers, to tell the Londoner in the morning of\r\nthe grim deed that had been done in Edinburgh overnight.  But when the\r\nnews did come it certainly startled London, and it raised up a perfect\r\npassion of rage, a _hysterica passio_, in the heart and brain of one\r\nperson.  That person was the Queen, who had herself specially ordered\r\nthe reprieve of the condemned man.  Queen Caroline's reason seemed for\r\nthe {66} moment to be wellnigh unhinged by her anger at the news.  She\r\nuttered the wildest threats, and talked vehemently of inflicting all\r\nmanner of impossible punishment upon Edinburgh for the offences of its\r\nmob.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1737--Scottish dignity]\r\n\r\nFortunately for the maintenance of peace between the two countries, the\r\nquestion of the justice or the injustice of Porteous's fate was not to\r\nbe settled by the caprice of an irritated woman.  In obedience,\r\nhowever, to the Queen's wishes, the Government introduced into the\r\nHouse of Lords, in April, 1737, a Bill the terms of which proposed to\r\ndisable the Lord Provost of Edinburgh, Alexander Wilson, \"from taking,\r\nholding, or enjoying any office or place of magistracy in the city of\r\nEdinburgh, or elsewhere in Great Britain, and for imprisoning the said\r\nAlexander Wilson, and for abolishing the town guard kept up in the said\r\ncity, commonly called the Town Guard, and for taking away the gates of\r\nthe Netherbow port of the said city, and keeping open the same.\"  The\r\nBill was the occasion of long and bitter debates, in which Lord\r\nCarteret made himself the most conspicuous advocate of the Government\r\nmeasure, and the Duke of Argyll acted as the chief champion of the\r\nScotch peers, who resolutely opposed it.  The debate was curious and\r\ninstructive, in serving to show the extreme delicacy of the relations\r\nbetween England and Scotland, and the difficulties presented by the\r\ndifferences between the Scotch law and the English law.  Porteous was\r\ntried and condemned naturally by Scotch law, and many, if not most, of\r\nthe English advocates of the Bill seemed to find it hard to put it out\r\nof their heads that because the trial was not conducted in accordance\r\nwith the principles of English legislation it could possibly be a fair\r\nor a just trial.\r\n\r\nIf the Bill was calculated to irritate the susceptibilities of the\r\nScotch peers, there were attendant circumstances still more irritating.\r\nThe three Scotch judges were summoned from Scotland to answer certain\r\nlegal questions connected with the debate.  On their arrival a fresh\r\ndebate sprang up on the question whether they should be {67} examined\r\nat the Bar of the House of Lords or upon the wool-sacks.  The Scotch\r\npeers considered it disrespectful to their judges to be examined at the\r\nBar of the House of Lords, and urged some of their arguments against it\r\nin terms of ominous warning.  It is curious to find a speaker in this\r\ndebate telling the Government that the strength of the legal union that\r\nexisted between England and Scotland depended entirely upon the way in\r\nwhich the people of Scotland were treated by the majority in the two\r\nHouses.  If any encroachment be made, the speaker urged, on those\r\narticles which have been stipulated between the two countries, the\r\nlegal union will be of little force: the Scotch people will be apt to\r\nascribe to the present royal family all the ills they feel or imagine\r\nthey feel; and if they should unanimously join in a contrary interest\r\nthey would be supported by a powerful party in England as well as by a\r\npowerful party beyond the seas.  For such reasons the speaker urged\r\nthat any insult, or seeming insult, to the people of Scotland was\r\nespecially to be avoided, and any disrespect to the Scotch judges would\r\nbe looked upon by the whole nation as a violation of the Articles of\r\nUnion and an indignity to the Scottish people.\r\n\r\nThe use of such words in the House of Lords within two-and-twenty years\r\nof the rising of 1715 ought to have been found most significant.  No\r\none who was present and who heard those words could guess indeed that\r\nwithin eight more years Scotland and England would witness a rising yet\r\nmore formidable than that of the Old Pretender, a rising which would\r\nput for a moment in serious peril the Hanoverian hold of the throne.\r\nBut they might well have been accepted as of the gravest import by\r\nthose who voted for the attendance of the Scotch judges at the Bar of\r\nthe House of Lords, and who carried their point by a majority of twelve.\r\n\r\nThe question of the judges being settled, the debate on the Bill went\r\non, and the measure was read a third time, on Wednesday, May 11th, and\r\npassed by a majority of fifty-four to twenty-two.  On the following\r\nMonday, May 16th, {68} the Bill was sent down to the House of Commons,\r\nwhere it occasioned debates even warmer than the debates in the Upper\r\nHouse.  The Scotch opposition was more successful in the Commons than\r\nit had been in the Lords.  So strenuously was the measure opposed that\r\nat one time it seemed likely to be lost altogether, and was only saved\r\nfrom extinction by a casting vote.  When at last it was read a third\r\ntime, on June 13th, it was a very different measure, in name and in\r\nform, from the Bill which had come down from the Peers a month earlier.\r\nThe proposal to abolish the Edinburgh city guard and to destroy the\r\ngate of the Netherbow port disappeared from the Bill, and the proposed\r\npunitive measures finally resolved themselves into the infliction of a\r\nfine of two thousand pounds upon the city of Edinburgh, and the\r\ndeclaration that the provost, Alexander Wilson, was incapable of\r\nholding office.  Such was the pacific conclusion of a controversy that\r\nat one time seemed likely to put a dangerous strain upon the amicable\r\nrelations between the two countries.  It may indeed be shrewdly\r\nsuspected that the memory of the Porteous mob, and of the part which\r\nthe Hanoverian Queen and the Whig Government played in connection with\r\nit, may have had no small share in fanning the embers of Jacobite\r\nenthusiasm in Scotland in swelling the ranks of the sympathizers with\r\nKing James and Prince Charles over the water, and in precipitating the\r\ninsurrectionary storm which was to make memorable the name of the\r\nForty-five.  Perhaps to the world at large the most momentous result of\r\nthat wild and stormy episode is to be found in the enchanting fiction\r\nwhich has illuminated, with the genius of Walter Scott, the stirring\r\nscenes of the Porteous riots, and has lent an air of heroic dignity and\r\nbeauty to the obscure smuggler, George Robertson.  It is the happy\r\nprivilege of the true romancer to find history his handmaid, and to\r\nmake obscure events immortal, whether they be the scuffles of Greeks\r\nand barbarians outside a small town in Asia Minor, or the lynching of a\r\ndissolute adventurer by an Edinburgh mob at the Grassmarket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{69}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nFAMILY JARS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1737--Unpopularity of George the Second]\r\n\r\n\"How is the wind now for the King?\"  \"Like the nation--against him.\"\r\nSuch was the question put, and such the answer promptly given, by two\r\npersons meeting in a London street during certain stormy days of\r\nDecember, 1736.  The King had been on a visit to his loved Hanover.\r\nWhen the royal yachts were returning, some fierce tempests sprang up\r\nand raged along both coasts; and the King's vessel was forced to return\r\nto Helvoetsluis, in Holland, from which she had sailed.  She had parted\r\ncompany with some of the other vessels.  The storms continued to rage,\r\nand the King, who had been most reluctant to leave Hanover, was wild\r\nwith impatience to get away from Helvoetsluis.  Having had to take\r\nleave of Madame Walmoden, he was now anxious to get back to the Queen.\r\nHe sailed for Helvoetsluis while the tempest was still not wholly\r\nallayed, and another tempest seemed likely to spring up.  News\r\ntravelled slowly in those times, and there were successive intervals of\r\nseveral days, during which the English Court and the English public did\r\nnot know whether George was safe in a port, or was drifting on a wreck,\r\nor was lying at the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\nThat was a trying time for the Queen and those who stood by her.\r\nGeorge the Second was just then very unpopular in London, and indeed\r\nall over England.  \"The King's danger,\" Lord Hervey says, \"did not in\r\nthe least soften the minds of the people towards him; a thousand\r\nimpertinent and treasonable reflections were thrown out against him\r\nevery day publicly in the streets--such as wishing him at the bottom of\r\nthe sea; that he had been {70} drowned instead of some of the poor\r\nsailors that had been washed off the decks--and many other affectionate\r\n_douceurs_ in the same style.\"  A man went into an ale-house where\r\nseveral soldiers were drinking; he addressed them \"as brave English\r\nboys,\" and called on them to drink \"damnation to your master.\"  The man\r\nwent on to argue that there was no reason why the English people should\r\nnot hate the King, and that the King had gone to Hanover only to spend\r\nthe money of England there, and to bring back his Hanoverian mistress.\r\nThere is not much in this of any particular importance; but there is\r\nsignificance in what followed.  The man was arrested, and the sergeant\r\nwho was with the soldiers when the invitation to drink was given went\r\nto Sir Robert Walpole to tell him what had happened.  Sir Robert\r\nthanked the sergeant and rewarded him, but enjoined him to leave out of\r\nthe affidavit he would have to make any allusion to the English money\r\nand the Hanoverian mistress.  There was quite enough in the mere\r\ninvitation to drink the disloyal toast, Sir Robert said, to secure the\r\noffender's punishment; but the Prime-minister was decidedly of opinion\r\nthat the less said just then in public about the spending of English\r\nmoney and the endowment of Hanoverian women, the better for peace and\r\nquietness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1737--The Prince of Wales]\r\n\r\nThe Queen and Sir Robert and Lord Hervey were in constant consultation.\r\nThey would not show in public the fear which all alike entertained.\r\nThe Queen went to chapel, and passed her evenings with her circle just\r\nas usual; but she was in the uttermost alarm and the deepest distress.\r\nAny hour might bring the news that the King was drowned; and who could\r\ntell what might not happen in England then?  Of course in the natural\r\norder of things the Prince of Wales would succeed to the throne; and\r\nwhat would become of the Queen and Walpole and Hervey then?  Hervey,\r\nindeed, tried to reassure the Queen, and to persuade her that her son\r\nwould acknowledge her influence and be led by it; but Caroline could\r\nnot be prevailed upon to indulge in such a hope even for {71} a moment.\r\nTo add to her troubles, her daughter, the Princess of Orange, was lying\r\nin a most dangerous condition at the Hague--her confinement had taken\r\nplace; she had suffered terribly; and, to save her life, it had been\r\nfound necessary to sacrifice the unborn child, a daughter.  Every hour\r\nthat passed without bringing news of the King seemed to increase the\r\nchance of the news when it came proving the worst.  Such was the moment\r\nwhen the Prince of Wales made himself conspicuous by several bids for\r\npopularity.  He gave a dinner to the Lord Mayor and aldermen of the\r\nCity of London on the occasion of their presenting him with the freedom\r\nof the city.  The Queen, who, for all her philosophical scepticism and\r\nher emancipated mind, had many lingering superstitions in her, saw an\r\nevil omen in the fact that the only two Princes of Wales who before\r\nFrederick had been presented with the freedom of the city were Charles\r\nthe First and James the Second.  The prince was reported to the Queen\r\nto have made several speeches at the dinner which were certain to\r\ningratiate him in popular favor.  \"My God!\" she exclaimed, \"popularity\r\nalways makes me sick; but Fritz's popularity makes me vomit.\"  People\r\ntold her that the prince and those around him talked of the King's\r\nbeing cast away \"with the same _sang-froid_ as you would talk of a\r\ncoach being overturned.\"  She said she had been told that Frederick\r\nstrutted about as if he were already King.  But she added, \"He is such\r\nan ass that one cannot tell what he thinks; and yet he is not so great\r\na fool as you take him for, neither.\"  The Princess Caroline vowed that\r\nif the worst were to prove true, she would run out of the house _au\r\ngrand galop_.  Walpole described the prince to Hervey as \"a poor, weak,\r\nirresolute, false, lying, dishonest, contemptible wretch,\" and asked,\r\n\"What is to become of this divided family and this divided country?\"\r\nIt is something of a relief to find that there was in one mind at least\r\na thought of what might happen to the country.\r\n\r\nWe have to take all these pictures of Frederick on {72} trust--on the\r\nfaith of the father who loathed him, of the mother who detested and\r\ndespised him, of the brothers and sisters who shrank away from him, of\r\nthe minister who could not find words enough to express his hatred and\r\ncontempt for him.  Of course the mere fact that father and mother,\r\nbrothers and sisters, felt thus towards the prince is terrible\r\ntestimony against him.  But there does not seem much in his conduct, at\r\nleast in his public conduct, during this crisis, which might not bear a\r\nfavorable interpretation.  He might have given his dinners, as the\r\nQueen held her public drawing-rooms, for the purpose of preventing the\r\nspread of an alarm.  No doubt the entertainment to the Lord Mayor and\r\naldermen had been long arranged; and the prince may have thought it\r\nwould be unwise to put it off at such a moment.  Every report was\r\nbelieved against him.  A fire broke out at the Temple, and the prince\r\nwent down and stayed all night, giving directions and taking the\r\ncontrol of the work for the putting out of the flames.  His exertions\r\nundoubtedly helped to save the Temple from destruction; and he became\r\nfor the time a hero with the populace.  It was reported to Caroline\r\nthat either the prince himself or some of his friends were going about\r\nsaying that the crowd on the night of the fire kept crying out, \"Crown\r\nhim! crown him!\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1737--Monarchy a prosaic institution]\r\n\r\nSo far as the alarm of the Queen and Walpole had to do with the state\r\nof the country, it does not seem that there was any solid ground.  What\r\nwould have happened if the bloated King had been tossed ashore a corpse\r\non the coast of England or the coast of Holland?  So far as the public\r\naffairs of England are concerned, nothing in particular would have\r\nhappened, we think.  George would have been buried in right royal\r\nfashion; there would have been an immense concourse of sight-seers to\r\nstare at the royal obsequies; and Frederick would have been proclaimed,\r\nand the people would have taken little notice of the fact.  What could\r\nit have mattered to the English people whether George the Second or his\r\neldest son was {73} on the throne?  No doubt Frederick was generally\r\ndistrusted and disliked wherever he was known; but, then, George the\r\nSecond was ever so much more widely known, and therefore was ever so\r\nmuch more distrusted and disliked.  The chances of a successful\r\nJacobite rising would not have been affected in any way by the fact\r\nthat it was this Hanoverian prince and not that who was sitting on the\r\nthrone of England.  It would be hardly possible to find a more utterly\r\nunkingly and ignoble sovereign than George the Second; it is hardly\r\npossible that his son could have turned out any worse; and there was,\r\nat all events, the possibility that he might turn out better.  Outside\r\nLondon and Richmond very few people cared in the least which of the\r\nHanoverians wore the crown.  Those who were loyal to the reigning\r\nfamily were honestly loyal on the principle that it was better for the\r\ncountry to have a Hanoverian sovereign than a Stuart.  Many of those\r\nwho in their feelings were still devoted to the Stuart tradition did\r\nnot think it would be worth while plunging the country into a civil war\r\nfor the almost hopeless chance of a revolution.  England was beginning\r\nto see that, with all the corruption of Parliament and the\r\nconstituencies under Walpole's administration, there was yet a very\r\nmuch better presentation of constitutional government than they had\r\never seen before.  The arbitrary power of the sovereign had practically\r\nceased to affect anybody outside the circles of the Ministry and the\r\nCourt.  The law tribunals sat and judged men impartially according to\r\ntheir lights, and person and property were at least secure against the\r\narbitrary intrusion of the sovereign power.  The old-fashioned\r\nchivalric, picturesque loyalty was gone; not merely because royalty\r\nitself had ceased to be chivalric and picturesque, but because men had,\r\nafter so many experiments and changes, come to regard the monarchy as a\r\nmerely practical and prosaic institution, to be rated according to its\r\nworking merits.  The majority in England at the time when George was\r\ntossing about the North Sea, or waiting impatiently at Helvoetsluis,\r\nhad come to the conclusion {74} that on the whole the monarchy worked\r\nbetter under the Hanoverians than it had done under the Stuarts, and\r\nwas more satisfactory than the protectorate of Cromwell.  Therefore, we\r\ndo not believe there was the slightest probability that the loss of\r\nGeorge the Second would have brought any political trouble on the\r\nState.  One can imagine objections made even by very moderate and\r\nreasonable Englishmen to each and all of the Hanoverian kings; but we\r\nfind it hard to imagine how any reasonable Englishman, who had quietly\r\nput up with George the Second, should be at any pains to resist the\r\naccession of George the Second's eldest son.\r\n\r\nBut the truth is that although in her many consultations with Walpole\r\nand with Hervey the Queen did sometimes let drop a word or two about\r\nthe condition of the country and the danger to the State, she was not\r\nthinking much about the state of the country.  She was thinking\r\nhonestly about herself and those who were around her, and whom she\r\nloved and wished to see maintained in comfort and in dignity.  Her\r\nconviction was that if her son Frederick came to the throne she and her\r\nother children would be forced to go into an obscure life in Somerset\r\nHouse, the old palace which had been assigned to her in her jointure,\r\nand that they would even in that obscurity have to depend very much on\r\nthe charity of the new King.  This was the view Walpole took of the\r\nprospect.  He thought those most in peril, those most to be pitied,\r\nwere the Queen and the duke, her son, and the princesses.  \"I do not\r\nknow,\" said Walpole to Hervey, \"any people in the world so much to be\r\npitied as that gay young company with which you and I stand every day\r\nin the drawing-room, at that door from which we this moment came, bred\r\nup in state, in affluence, caressed and courted, and to go at once from\r\nthat into dependence on a brother who loves them not, and whose\r\nextravagance and covetousness will make him grudge every guinea they\r\nspend, as it must come from out of a purse not sufficient to defray the\r\nexpenses of his own vices.\"\r\n\r\n{75}\r\n\r\nWalpole, to do him justice, did think of the country.  For all his\r\nrough, coarse, selfish ways, Walpole was an English patriot.  He\r\nthought of the country, but he saw no danger to national interests in\r\nthe change from George to Frederick.  He saw, indeed, a great prospect\r\nof miserable mismanagement, blundering, and confusion in the\r\nGovernment.  He foresaw the reliance of the coming King on the most\r\nworthless favorites.  He foresaw more corruption and of a worse kind,\r\nand more maladministration, than there had been before at any time\r\nsince the accession of George the First.  He feared that it might not\r\nbe possible for him to remain at the head of affairs when Frederick\r\nshould have come to reign.  But he does not appear to have had any\r\ndread of any immediate cataclysm or even disturbance.  The troubles\r\nWalpole looked for were troubles which might indeed make government\r\ndifficult, disturb the House of Commons, and bring discomfort of the\r\nbitterest kind into Court circles, but which would be hardly heard of\r\nin the great provincial towns, and not heard of at all in the\r\ncountry--at least not heard of outside the park railings of the great\r\ncountry-houses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1737--A Royal love-letter]\r\n\r\nWhatever the alarm, it was destined suddenly to pass away.  While\r\nCaroline was already secretly putting her heart into mourning for her\r\nhusband the news was suddenly brought that George was safe and sound in\r\nHelvoetsluis.  He had been compelled to return, and there he had to\r\nremain weather-bound.  He wrote to the Queen a long, tender, and\r\nimpassioned love-letter--like the letter of a youthful lover in whose\r\nheart the first feeling on an unexpected escape from death is the glad\r\nthought that he is to look once again on the fair face of his\r\nsweetheart.  George really had a gift for love-letter writing, the only\r\nliterary gift which he seems to have possessed.  It is impossible to\r\nread the letters from Helvoetsluis without believing that they were\r\nwritten under the inspiration of genuine emotion.  Their style might\r\nwell raise over again that interesting subject of speculation--whether\r\nit is in the power of man to be in love with two or more women {76} the\r\nsame time.  King George was unquestionably in love with Madame\r\nWalmoden: while he was near her he could think of nothing else.  He was\r\nin Hanover, feasting and dancing, always in Madame Walmoden's company,\r\nwhile his daughter was lying on what seemed at one time like to be her\r\ndeath-bed at the Hague.  It is not a very far cry from Hanover to the\r\nHague, but it never occurred to George to entertain the idea of leaving\r\nMadame Walmoden to go and pay a visit to his daughter.  Out of Madame\r\nWalmoden's presence his thoughts appear to have flown at once back to\r\nhis wife.  To her he wrote, not in the mere language of conjugal\r\naffection and sympathy, but with the passionate raptures of young love\r\nitself.  The Queen was immensely proud of this letter, although she\r\ntook care to say that she believed she was not unreasonably proud of\r\nit.  She showed it to Walpole and to Hervey, who both agreed that they\r\nhad a most incomprehensible master.  Walpole was a very shrewd and\r\nkeen-sighted man, but he did not understand Queen Caroline or her\r\nfeeling towards her husband.  He had told Hervey more than once that he\r\ndid not know whether the Queen hated more her son or her husband; and,\r\nindeed, he said there was good reason why she should hate the husband\r\nthe more of the two, seeing that he had treated her so badly while she\r\nhad been all devotion to him.  The love of a woman is not always\r\ngoverned by a sense of gratefulness.  There are women whose hearts are\r\nlike the grape, and give out their best juices to him who tramples on\r\nthem.  If anything is certain in all the coarse and dreary story of\r\nthat Court, it is that Queen Caroline adored her husband--that she was\r\ntoo fond of her most filthy bargain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1737--A fickle, inconsiderate Prince]\r\n\r\nThe danger in which George had been, and out of which he had escaped,\r\ndid not in any way soften the hearts of King and prince, of father and\r\nson, towards each other.  The prince still occupied a suite of rooms in\r\nSt. James's Palace, and the King and he met on public occasions, but\r\nthey never spoke.  The Queen was even more constant in her hatred to\r\nthe prince than the King himself.  It does {77} not seem possible to\r\nfind out how this detestation of the son by the mother ever began to\r\nfill the Queen's heart.  She was not an unloving mother; indeed, where\r\nher affection to the King did not stand in the way, she was fond and\r\ntender to nearly all her children.  But towards her eldest son she\r\nseems to have felt something like a physical aversion.  Then, again,\r\nthe King was a dull, stupid, loutish man, over whose clouded faculties\r\nany absurd prejudice or dislike might have settled unquestioned; but\r\nCaroline was a bright, clever, keen-witted woman, who asked herself and\r\nothers why this or that should be.  She must have many times questioned\r\nher own heart and reasoned with herself before she allowed it to be\r\nfilled forever with hatred to her son.  Lord Hervey, who had a true\r\nregard for her, and in whom she trusted as much as she trusted any\r\nhuman being, does not appear to have ever fully understood the cause of\r\nthe Queen's feelings towards the prince; nor does he appear to have\r\nshared her utter distrust and dislike of him.  As far as one can judge,\r\nthe prince appears to have been fickle, inconsiderate, and flighty\r\nrather than deliberately bad.  He sometimes did things which made him\r\nseem like a madman.  Such a person would not be charmed into a\r\nhealthier condition of mind and temper by the knowledge daily thrust\r\nupon him that his own father and mother, and his own sister, were the\r\nthree persons who hated him most in the world.  Of course, in this as\r\nin other cases of a palace quarrel between a king and an eldest son,\r\nthere was a bitter wrangle about money.  The prince demanded an\r\nallowance of one hundred thousand a year to be secured to him\r\nindependently of his father's power to recall or reduce it.  The King\r\nhad hitherto only given him what Frederick called a beggarly allowance\r\nof fifty thousand a year, and even that had not been made over to the\r\nprince unconditionally and forever.  The prince argued that his\r\nfather's civil list was now much larger than that of George the First\r\nat the time when the Prince of Wales of that day, George the Second\r\nnow, was allowed an income of one {78} hundred thousand a year.  The\r\nPrincess of Wales had as yet received no jointure, and she and the\r\nprince were thus kept, as Frederick's friends insisted, in the\r\ncondition of mere pensioners and dependants upon the royal bounty.  The\r\nprince's friends were, for the most part, eager to stir him up to some\r\nopen measure of hostility; especially the younger men of the party were\r\ndoing their best to drive the prince on.  Pulteney, it must be said,\r\nwas not for any such course of action, indeed, was against it, and had\r\ngiven the prince good advice; and Carteret was not for it.  But Lord\r\nChesterfield and several other peers, and Lyttelton and William Pitt in\r\nthe House of Commons, were eager for the fray, and their counsels\r\nprevailed.  To use an expression which became famous at a much later\r\nday, \"the young man's head was on fire,\" and it soon became known to\r\nthe King and Queen that the prince had resolved to act upon a\r\nsuggestion made by Bolingbroke two years before, and submit his claim\r\nto the decision of Parliament.  More than that, when Walpole was\r\nconsulted Walpole felt himself obliged to declare his belief, or at\r\nleast his fear, that if the prince should persist in making his claim\r\nhe would find himself supported by a majority in the House of Commons.\r\nThe story had reached the Queen in the first instance through Lord\r\nHervey, and the manner of its reaching Lord Hervey is worth mentioning,\r\nbecause it brings in for the first time a name destined to be famous\r\nduring two succeeding generations.  The prince, having been persuaded\r\nto appeal to Parliament, at once began touting for support and for\r\nvotes after the fashion of a candidate for a Parliamentary\r\nconstituency.  He sent the Duke of Marlborough to speak to Mr. Henry\r\nFox, a young member of Parliament, and to ask Mr. Fox for his vote.\r\nHenry Fox was the younger of two brothers, both of whom were intimate\r\nfriends of Lord Hervey.  He had not been long in the House of Commons,\r\nhaving obtained a seat in 1735, as member for Hendon, in Wiltshire.  He\r\nhad come into Parliament in the same year with William Pitt, whose\r\nforemost political rival he was soon destined {79} to be.  He was also\r\ndestined to be the father of the greatest rival of his opponent's son.\r\nEnglish public life was to see a Pitt and a Fox opposed to each other\r\nat the head of rival parties in one generation, and a far greater Fox\r\nand a not inferior Pitt standing in just the same attitude of rivalry\r\nin the generation that succeeded.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1737--A Royal liar]\r\n\r\nHenry Fox went at once to Lord Hervey and told him how he had been\r\nasked to support the prince, and how he had answered that he should do\r\nas his brother did, whatever that might be.  Lord Hervey at first was\r\nnot inclined to attach much importance to the story.  He said he had\r\nheard so often that the prince was going to take up such a course of\r\naction and nothing had come of it so far, and he did not suppose\r\nanything would come of it this time.  Fox, however, assured him that\r\nthe attempt would now most certainly be made, and was surprised to find\r\nthat the ministers appeared to know nothing about it.  He declared that\r\nhe did not believe there was a man on the side of the Opposition who\r\nhad not already been asked for his vote.  Lord Hervey hurried to the\r\nQueen and told her the unpleasant news.  Caroline sent for Walpole; and\r\nat last the story was told to the King himself.  The Queen was urged by\r\nLord Hervey to speak to her son privately, and endeavor to induce him\r\nnot to declare open war upon his father.  The Queen would not do\r\nanything of the kind.  She declared that her speaking to her son would\r\nonly make him more obstinate than ever, and that he was such a liar\r\nthat it would not be safe for her to enter into any private conference\r\nwith him.  Other intercessors were found, but the prince was\r\nunyielding; and George himself, as obstinate as his son, could not be\r\ninduced at first by Walpole, or by any one else, to make any show of\r\nconcession or compromise.  The Princess Caroline kept saying ever so\r\nmany times a day that she prayed her brother might drop down dead; that\r\nhe was a nauseous beast, and she grudged him every hour he continued to\r\nexist.  These sisterly expressions did not contribute much to any\r\nmanner of settlement, and the prince held on his course.  {80} The\r\ncalculations of Frederick's friends gave him in advance a majority of\r\nforty in the House of Commons; and even the most experienced\r\ncalculators of votes on the King's side allowed to the prince a\r\nmajority of ten.  Walpole began to think the crisis one of profound\r\ndanger.  He felt it only too likely that the fate of his administration\r\nwould depend on the division in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1737--Frederick's \"dutiful expressions\"]\r\n\r\nSomething must be done; something at least must be attempted.  Walpole\r\nsaw nothing for it but to endeavor to arrange a compromise.  Parliament\r\nhad opened on February 1st, and the day appointed for the debate on\r\nthis important question of the prince's allowance was to be Tuesday,\r\nthe 22d of the month.  On the Monday previous, Walpole made up his mind\r\nthat if the King did not offer some fair show of compromise his party\r\nwould be beaten when the question came to be put to the vote.  His plan\r\nof arrangement was that the King should spontaneously send to the\r\nprince an intimation that he was willing to settle a jointure at once\r\non the princess, with the added remark that this had already been under\r\nconsideration--which indeed was true--not a very common occurrence in\r\nRoyal messages of that day; and that he was also prepared to settle\r\nfifty thousand a year on the prince himself forever and without\r\ncondition.  Walpole did not believe that the prince would accept this\r\noffer of compromise.  He knew very well that Frederick, full of\r\narrogant confidence and obstinacy, and backed up by the zeal and\r\npassion of his friends, would be certain to refuse it.  But Walpole was\r\nnot thinking much about the impression which the offer would make on\r\nthe prince.  The thought uppermost in his mind was of the impression it\r\nwould make on the House of Commons.  Unless some new impression could\r\nbe made upon the House, the triumph of the prince was absolutely\r\ncertain; and Walpole felt sure that if any step could now alter the\r\ncondition of things in the House of Commons it would be the publication\r\nof the fact that the King had spontaneously held out the olive-branch;\r\nthat {81} he had offered a fair compromise, and that the prince had\r\nrefused it.\r\n\r\nWalpole had much trouble to prevail upon the King to make any offer of\r\ncompromise.  Even Lord Hervey was strongly of opinion that the attempt\r\nwould be a failure, that the proffered concession would be wholly\r\nthrown away; such a movement, he said, would neither put off the battle\r\nnor gain the King one single desertion from the ranks of the enemy,\r\nwhile to the King's own party it would seem something like a lowering\r\nof the flag.  Walpole, however, persevered, and he carried his point.\r\nA deputation, headed by the new Lord Chancellor, Lord Hardwicke, who\r\nhad succeeded to the Great Seal on the death of his famous rival, Lord\r\nChancellor Talbot, was sent to wait on the prince and submit to him the\r\nproposition of his father.  The prince answered rather ungraciously\r\nthat the matter was entirely out of his hands now, and that therefore\r\nhe could give no answer to the Royal message.  It must be gratifying to\r\nevery patriotic soul to know that his Royal Highness accompanied this\r\ndeclaration with \"many dutiful expressions\" towards his father, and\r\nthat he even went so far as to say he was sorry it was not in his power\r\nto do otherwise than as he had done.  The dutiful expressions did not\r\nby any means charm away the wrath either of the King or the Queen.  The\r\ntwo stormed and raged against Frederick, and called him by many very\r\nhard names.  Both were much disposed to storm against Walpole too, for\r\nthe advice he had given, and for his pertinacity in forcing them on to\r\na step which had brought nothing but humiliation.  Walpole bore his\r\nposition with a kind of patience which might be called either proud or\r\nstolid, according as one is pleased to look at it.  With all his\r\ncourage, Walpole must have felt some qualms of uneasiness now and then,\r\nbut if he did feel he certainly did not show them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{82}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nA PERILOUS VICTORY.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1737--Incentives to valor]\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, February 22d, the debate took place in the House of Commons.\r\nIt came on in the form of a motion for an address to the Sovereign,\r\npraying that he would make to the Prince of Wales an independent\r\nallowance of one hundred thousand a year.  The motion was proposed by\r\nPulteney himself.  Lord Hervey seems to be surprised that Pulteney, after\r\nhaving advised the prince not to press on any such motion, should,\r\nnevertheless, when the prince did persevere, actually propose the motion\r\nhimself.  But such a course is common enough even in our own days, when\r\nstatesmen make greater effort at political and personal consistency.  A\r\nman often argues long and earnestly in the Cabinet or in the councils of\r\nthe Opposition against some particular proposal, and then, when it is, in\r\nspite of his advice, made a party resolve, he goes to the House of\r\nCommons and speaks in its favor; nay, even it may be, proposes it.\r\nPulteney made a long and what would now be called an exhaustive speech.\r\nIt was stuffed full of portentous erudition about the early history of\r\nthe eldest sons of English kings.  The speech was said to have been\r\ndelivered with much less than Pulteney's usual force and fire; and\r\nindeed, so far as one can judge by the accounts--they can hardly be\r\ncalled reports--preserved of it, one is obliged to regard it as rather a\r\nlanguid and academical dissertation.  We start off with what Henry the\r\nThird did for his son, afterwards Edward the First, when that noble youth\r\nhad reached the unripe age of fourteen.  He granted to him the Duchy of\r\nGuienne; he put him in possession of the Earldom of {83} Chester; he made\r\nhim owner of the cities and towns of Bristol, Stamford, and Grantham,\r\nwith several other castles and manors; he created him Prince of Wales, to\r\nwhich, lest it should be merely a barren title, he annexed all the\r\nconquered lands in Wales; and he created him Governor of Ireland.  All\r\nthis, to be sure, was mightily liberal on the part of Henry the Third,\r\nand a very handsome and right royal way of providing for his own family;\r\nbut it might be supposed an argument rather to frighten than to encourage\r\na modern English Parliament.  But the orator went on to show what\r\nglorious deeds in arms were done by this highly endowed prince, and the\r\ninferences which he appeared to wish his audience to draw were twofold:\r\nfirst, that Edward would never have done these glorious deeds if his\r\nfather had not given him these magnificent allowances; and next, that if\r\nan equal, or anything like an equal, liberality were shown to Frederick,\r\nPrince of Wales, it was extremely probable that he would rush into the\r\nfield at the first opportunity and make a clean sweep of the foes of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nWe need not follow the orator through his account of what was done for\r\nEdward the Black Prince, and what Edward the Black Prince had done in\r\nconsequence; and how Henry the Fifth had been able to conquer France\r\nbecause of his father's early liberality.  The whole argument tended to\r\nimpress upon the House of Commons the maxim that in a free country, above\r\nall others, it is absolutely necessary to have the heir-apparent of the\r\ncrown bred up in a state of grandeur and independency.  Despite the\r\nhigh-flown sentiments and the grandiose historical illustrations in which\r\nthe speaker indulged, there seems to the modern intelligence an inherent\r\nmeanness, a savor of downright vulgarity, through the whole of it.  If\r\nyou give a prince only fifty thousand a year, you can't expect anything\r\nof him.  What can he know of grandeur of soul, of national honor, of\r\nconstitutional rights, of political liberty?  You can't get these\r\nqualities in a prince unless you pay him at least a hundred thousand a\r\nyear while his {84} father is living.  [Sidenote: 1737--Providing for a\r\nPrince] The argument would have told more logically if the English\r\nParliament were going into the open market to buy the best prince they\r\ncould get.  There would be some show of reason in arguing that the more\r\nwe pay the better article we shall have.  But it is hard indeed to\r\nunderstand how a prince who is to be worth nothing if you give him only\r\nfifty thousand a year, will be another Black Prince or Henry the Fifth if\r\nyou let him have the spending of fifty thousand a year more.  Walpole led\r\nthe Opposition to the motion.  Much of the argument on both sides was\r\nessentially sordid, but there was a good deal also which was keen, close,\r\nand clever, and which may have even now a sort of constitutional\r\ninterest.  The friends of the prince knew they would have to meet the\r\ncontention that Parliament had no right to interfere with the Sovereign's\r\nappropriation of the revenues allotted to him.  They therefore contended,\r\nand, as it seems to us, with force and justice, that the Parliament which\r\nmade the grants had a perfect right to see that the grants were\r\nappropriated to the uses for which they were intended, to follow out the\r\ngrants in the course of their application, and even to direct that they\r\nshould be applied to entirely different purposes; even, if need were, to\r\nresume them.  It would naturally seem to follow from this assumption,\r\nthat Parliament had a right to call on the King to make the allowance to\r\nthe prince, but it would seem to follow also that the allowance ought not\r\nto be made independent and absolute.  For, if the Prince of Wales had an\r\nallowance absolutely independent of the will of any one, he had something\r\nwhich Pulteney and his friends were contending, as it was their business\r\njust then to contend, that the English Parliament had never consented to\r\ngive to the King.  On the other hand, it was pointed out with much effect\r\nthat there never had been any express regulation in England to provide\r\nthat the Prince of Wales should be made independent of his father, and\r\nthere was clear good-sense in the contempt with which Walpole treated the\r\nargument that the State dependency upon his father in {85} which the son\r\nof a great family usually lives, must necessarily tend to the debasing of\r\nthe son's mind and the diminishing of his intelligence, or that the\r\ndignity and grandeur even of a Prince of Wales could not be as well\r\nsupported by a yearly allowance as by a perpetual and independent\r\nsettlement.  Some of the speakers on Walpole's side--indeed, Walpole\r\nhimself occasionally--strove to show their willingness to serve the\r\nprince by utterances which must have caused the prince to smile a grim,\r\nsardonic smile if he had any existing sense of humor.  Please do not\r\nimagine--this was the line of observation--that we think one hundred\r\nthousand a year too much for his Royal Highness.  Oh dear, no; nothing of\r\nthe kind; we do not think it would be half enough if only the nation had\r\nthe money to give away.  \"Why,\" exclaimed one gushing orator, \"if we had\r\nthe money the only course we could take would be to offer his Royal\r\nHighness whatever he pleased to accept, and even in that case we should\r\nhave reason to fear lest his modesty might do an injury to his generosity\r\nby making him confine his demand within the strictest bounds of bare\r\nnecessity.\"  \"Were we,\" another member of the Court party declared, \"to\r\nmeasure the prince's allowance by the prince's merit, as we know no\r\nbounds to the latter, we could prescribe no bounds to the former.\"\r\nTherefore, as it was totally impossible that the treasury of any State\r\ncould reward this extraordinary prince according to his merit, the\r\nspeakers on Walpole's side mildly pleaded that they had only to fall back\r\non the cold and commonplace rules of ordinary economy, and try to find\r\nout what sum the nation could really afford to hand over.\r\n\r\nThe men who talked these revolting absurdities were saying among\r\nthemselves an hour after that the prince was an avaricious and greedy\r\nbeast, and were openly proclaiming their pious wish that Providence would\r\nbe graciously inclined to rid the world of him.  Nothing strikes one as\r\nmore painful and odious in the ways of that Court and that Parliament\r\nthan the language of sickening sycophancy which is used by all statesmen\r\nalike in public {86} with regard to kings and princes, for whom in\r\nprivate they could find no words of abuse too strong and coarse, no curse\r\ntoo profane.  Never was an Oriental despot the most vain and cruel\r\naddressed in language of more nauseous flattery by great ministers and\r\nofficers of State than were the early English sovereigns of the House of\r\nHanover.  The filthy indecency which came so habitually from the lips of\r\nWalpole, of other statesmen, of the King--sometimes even of the Queen\r\nherself--hardly seems more ignoble, more demoralizing, than the\r\noutpouring of a flattery as false as it was gross, a flattery that ought\r\nto have sickened alike the man who poured it out and the man whom it was\r\npoured over.  Poor, stupid George seems to have been always taken in by\r\nit.  Indeed, in his dull, heavy mind there was no praise the voice of man\r\ncould utter which could quite come up to his perfections.  The\r\nquicker-witted Queen sometimes writhed under it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1737--Comparisons]\r\n\r\nWalpole, however, did not depend upon argument to carry his point.  The\r\nstone up his sleeve, to use a somewhat homely expression, which he meant\r\nto fling at his enemy, was something quite different from any question of\r\nConstitution or prescription or precedent; of the genius of the Black\r\nPrince, and the manner in which Wild Hal, Falstaff's companion, had been\r\nendowed and allowanced into Henry, the victor of Agincourt.  Walpole\r\nflung down, metaphorically speaking, on the table of the House the record\r\nof the interview between the Prince of Wales and the great peers who\r\nwaited on him, bearing the message of the King.  The record set forth all\r\nthat had happened: how the King had declared himself willing to provide\r\nat once a suitable jointure for the Princess of Wales; how he had shown\r\nthat this had been under consideration, and explained in the simplest way\r\nthe reason why the arrangement had been delayed; how his Majesty had\r\nvoluntarily taken it on himself that the prince should have fifty\r\nthousand a year absolutely independent of the Sovereign's future action,\r\nand over and above the revenues arising from the duchy of Cornwall, which\r\nhis Majesty {87} thinks a very competent allowance, considering his own\r\nnumerous issue and the great expenses which do, and which necessarily\r\nmust, attend an honorable provision for his whole royal family.  And then\r\nthe record gave the answer of the Prince of Wales and its peculiar\r\nconclusion; \"Indeed, my lords, it is in other hands--I am sorry for it;\"\r\n\"or,\" as the record of the peers cautiously concluded, \"to that effect.\"\r\n\r\nThe reading of this document had one effect, which was instantly invoked\r\nfor it by Walpole.  It brought the whole controversy down to the question\r\nwhether the prince's father or the prince's friends ought to be the\r\nbetter authority as to the amount which the King could afford to give,\r\nand the amount which the prince ought to be encouraged to demand.  It\r\nshrunk, in fact, into a mean discussion about the cost of provisions and\r\nthe amounts of the land-tax; the number of children George the Second had\r\nto maintain as compared with the small family George the First had to\r\nprovide for; the fact that George the Second had a wife to maintain in\r\nbecoming state in England, whereas George the First had saved himself\r\nfrom the occasion of any such outlay; the total amount left for George\r\nthe Second to spend as compared with the total amount which the differing\r\nconditions left at the disposal of his illustrious father.  Let us see\r\nwhat the income of the Prince of Wales was computed to be by his friends\r\nat that time.  He had fifty thousand a year allowance.  From that, said\r\nhis friends, we must deduct the land-tax, which at two shillings in the\r\npound amounts to 5000 pounds a year.  This brings the allowance down to\r\n45,000 pounds.  Then comes the sixpenny duty to the Civil List lottery,\r\nwhich has also to be deducted from the poor prince's dwindling pittance,\r\nand likewise the fees payable at the Exchequer; and the sixpenny duty\r\namounts to 1250 pounds, and the fees to about 750 pounds, so that\r\naltogether 7000 pounds would have to be taken off, leaving the prince\r\nonly 43,000 pounds allowance.  Then, to be sure, there was the duchy of\r\nCornwall, the revenues of which, it was insisted, {88} did not amount to\r\nmore than 9000 pounds a year, so that, all told, the prince's income\r\navailable for spending purposes was but 53,000 pounds a year.  And yet,\r\nthey pleaded pathetically, the yearly expense of the prince's household,\r\nacknowledged and ratified by the King himself, came to 63,000 pounds\r\nwithout allowing his Royal Highness one shilling for the indulgence of\r\nthat generous and charitable disposition with which Heaven had so\r\nbounteously endowed him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wealthy King; semi-starved people]\r\n\r\nWalpole's instinct had conducted him right.  The reading of the message,\r\nwhich Walpole delivered with great rhetorical effect, carried confusion\r\ninto the Tory ranks.  Two hundred and four members voted for the Address,\r\ntwo hundred and thirty-four voted against it.  The King's friends were in\r\na majority of thirty.  Archdeacon Coxe in his \"Life of Walpole\" gives it\r\nas his opinion that the victory was obtained because some forty-five of\r\nthe Tories quitted the House in a body before the division, believing\r\nthat they were thus acting on constitutional principles, and that the\r\ninterference of the House of Commons would be an unconstitutional,\r\ndemocratic, and dangerous innovation.  But it is hardly possible to\r\nbelieve that the managers of the prince's case could have been kept in\r\ntotal ignorance up to the last moment of the fact that forty-five Tories\r\nwere determined to regard the interference of Parliament as\r\nunconstitutional, and to abstain from taking part in the division.  It is\r\ndeclared to be positively certain that the \"whips,\" as we should now call\r\nthem, of the prince's party had canvassed every man on their own side, if\r\nnot on both sides.  They could not have made up anything like the number\r\nthey announced in anticipation to the prince if they had taken into\r\naccount forty-five probable or possible abstentions among their own men.\r\nThe truth evidently is that the reading of the King's message compelled a\r\ngood many Tories to withdraw who already were somewhat uncertain as to\r\nthe constitutionalism, in the Tory sense, of the course their leaders\r\nwere taking.  They would probably have swallowed {89} their scruples but\r\nfor the message; that dexterous stroke of policy was too much for them.\r\nHow can we--they probably thus reasoned with themselves--back up to the\r\nlast a prince who positively refused to listen to the offer of a\r\ncompromise spontaneously made by his father?\r\n\r\nMoney went much further in those days than it does in ours.  Fifty\r\nthousand pounds a year must have been a magnificent fortune for a Prince\r\nof Wales in the earlier part of the last century.  On the other hand,\r\nGeorge the Second was literally stuffed and bloated with money.  He had\r\nbetween eight and nine hundred thousand a year, and his wife was richly\r\nprovided for.  Odious bad taste, selfishness, and griping avarice were\r\nexhibited on both sides of the dispute; it would be hard to say which\r\nside showed to the lesser advantage.  There was much poverty all this\r\ntime in London, and indeed over the whole country.  Trade was depressed;\r\nemployment was hard to get; within a stone's-throw of St. James's Palace\r\nmen, women, and children were living in a chronic condition of\r\nsemi-starvation.  The Court and the Parliament were wrangling fiercely\r\nover the question whether a king with a revenue of nearly a million could\r\nafford to give his eldest son an extra fifty thousand a year, and whether\r\na Prince of Wales could live in decency on fifty-three thousand a year.\r\nThe patient, cool-headed people of England who knew of all this--such of\r\nthem as did--and who hated both king and prince alike, yet put up with\r\nthe whole thing simply because they had come to the conviction that\r\nnothing was to be gained by any attempt at a change.  They had been\r\npassing through so many changes, they had been the victims of so many\r\nexperiments, that they had not the slightest inclination to venture on\r\nany new enterprise.  They preferred to bear the ills they had; but they\r\nknew that they were ills, and put on no affectation of a belief that they\r\nwere blessings.\r\n\r\nThe debate in the House of Lords took place on Friday, February 25th.\r\nLord Carteret proposed the motion for the Address to the King, and went\r\nover much of the {90} same historical ground that Pulteney had traversed\r\nin the Commons.  The Duke of Newcastle replied in his usual awkward and\r\nbungling fashion, with the uneasy attitudes and clownish gestures which\r\nwere characteristic of him.  He was not able to make any effective use of\r\nthe King's message, and the Lord Chancellor read it for him.  The\r\ndivision in the House of Lords showed seventy-nine votes and twenty-four\r\nproxies for the King, in all one hundred and three; and twenty-eight\r\nvotes and twelve proxies for the prince, in all forty; the King had a\r\nmajority, therefore, of sixty-three.  Some of the peers, among them Lord\r\nCarteret and Lord Chesterfield, signed a protest against the decision of\r\nthe House.  The protest is like so many other protests of the Lords--a\r\nvery interesting and even valuable State paper, setting forth as it does\r\nall the genuine arguments of the prince's supporters in the clearest form\r\nand in the fewest words.  The House of Lords at that time was a more\r\nindependent body than it has shown itself in later years.  Even already,\r\nhowever, it was giving signs of that decay as an effective political\r\ninstitution which had begun to set in, and which was the direct result of\r\nWalpole's determination to rely upon the representative Chamber for the\r\nreal work of governing the country.  Neither Walpole nor any one else\r\nseemed to care very much about the debate or the division in the House of\r\nLords.  Already discussions in that Chamber, no matter how eloquent and\r\nearnest in themselves, were beginning to assume that academic character\r\nwhich always, sooner or later, is exhibited where political debate is not\r\nendowed with any power to act directly on legislation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1737--A man of consequence]\r\n\r\nWalpole's victory was a very cheap affair in one sense; it cost only 900\r\npounds, of which 500 pounds were given to one man and 400 pounds to\r\nanother.  Even these two sums, Walpole used to say, were only advances.\r\nThe bribed men were to have had the money at the end of the session in\r\nany case, but they took advantage of the crisis to demand their pay at\r\nonce.  But in another sense it was a dear, {91} a very dear, victory to\r\nthe minister.  The consent of the King to the offer of compromise had\r\nbeen extorted, more than extorted, by Walpole.  Indeed, as Walpole often\r\nafterwards told the story, it was on his part not an extortion, but an\r\nactual disregard and overriding of the King's command.  The King refused\r\nat the last moment to send the message to the prince; Walpole said the\r\nPeers were waiting to carry it, and that carry it they should, and he\r\nwould not allow the King time to retract his former consent, and\r\nthereupon rushed off to the Lords of the Council and told them to go to\r\nthe prince with the message.  Even the Queen, Walpole said, had never\r\ngiven a real assent to the policy of the message.  When the victory in\r\nthe Commons was won, the King and Queen were at first well satisfied; but\r\nafterwards, when the prince became more rude and insolent in his conduct,\r\nthey both blamed Walpole for it, and insisted that his policy of\r\ncompromise had only filled the head and heart of the young man with pride\r\nand obstinacy, and that he regarded himself as a conqueror, even though\r\nhe had been nominally conquered.  The King felt bitterly about this, and\r\nthe grudge he bore to Walpole was of long endurance and envenomed anger.\r\nThe King and Queen would have got rid of him then if they could, Walpole\r\nthought.  \"I have been much nearer than you think,\" he said to Lord\r\nHervey, \"to throwing it all up and going to end my days at Houghton in\r\nquiet.\"  But he also told Hervey that he believed he was of more\r\nconsequence than any man before him ever was, or perhaps than any man\r\nmight ever be again, and so he still held on to his place.  No doubt\r\nWalpole meant that he was of more consequence than any man had been or\r\nprobably would be in England.  He did not mean, as Lord Hervey would seem\r\nto give out, that he believed he was a greater and more powerful man than\r\nJulius Caesar.  Lord Hervey's comment, however, is interesting.  \"With\r\nregard to States and nations,\" he coldly says, \"nobody's understanding is\r\nso much superior to the rest of mankind as to be missed in a week after\r\nthey have gone; and, with {92} regard to particulars, there is not a\r\ngreat banker that breaks who does not distress more people than the\r\ndisgrace or retirement of the greatest minister that ever presided in a\r\nCabinet; nor is there a deceased ploughman who leaves a wife and a dozen\r\nbrats behind him that is not lamented with greater sincerity, as well as\r\na loss to more individuals, than any statesman that ever wore a head or\r\ndeserved to lose it.\"  There is a good deal of wholesome, although\r\nperhaps somewhat melancholy, truth in what Lord Hervey says.  Perhaps we\r\nought not to call it melancholy; it ought rather to be considered\r\ncheerful and encouraging, in the national sense.  The world, some modern\r\nwriter has said, shuts up the shop for no man.  Yet there is,\r\nnevertheless, a tinge of melancholy in the thought of a great man\r\ntoiling, striving, giving up all his days and much of his nights to the\r\nservice of some cause or country, all the while firmly believing his life\r\nindispensable to the success of the cause, the prosperity of the country;\r\nand he dies, and the cause and the country go on just the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{93}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n\"ROGUES AND VAGABONDS.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1737--The English stage]\r\n\r\nThe condition of the English stage became a subject of some anxiety\r\nabout this time, and was made the occasion for the introduction of an\r\nimportant Act of Parliament.  The reader of to-day, looking back on the\r\ndramatic literature of the second George's reign, would not be apt to\r\nthink that it called for special measures of restriction.  The vices of\r\nthe Restoration period had apparently worked out their own cure.  The\r\nhideous indecency of Dryden, of Wycherley, and of Vanbrugh had brought\r\nabout a certain reaction.  The indecency of such authors as these was\r\nnot merely a coarseness of expression such as most of the Elizabethan\r\nwriters freely indulged in, and which has but little to do with the\r\ndeeper questions of morality; nor did its evil consist merely in the\r\nchoice of subjects which are painful to study, and of questionable\r\ninfluence on the mind.  Many of the finest plays of Ford and Massinger\r\nand Webster turn on sin and crime, the study of which it might\r\nreasonably be contended must always have the effect of disturbing the\r\nmoral sense, if not of actually depraving the mind.  But no one can\r\npretend to find in the best of the Elizabethan writers any sympathy\r\nwith viciousness, any stimulus to immorality.  Of the Restoration\r\nauthors, in general, the very contrary has to be said.  They revel in\r\nuncleanness; they glorify immorality.  It is the triumph and the honor\r\nof a gentleman to seduce his friend's wife or his neighbor's daughter.\r\nThe business and the glory of men is the seduction of women.  The\r\nsympathy of the dramatic author and his readers goes always with the\r\nseducer.  The husband of the {94} faithless wife is a subject of\r\ninextinguishable merriment and laughter.  His own friends are made to\r\nlaugh at him, and to feel a genuine delight in his suffering and his\r\nshame.  The question of morality altogether apart, it seems positively\r\nwonderful to an English reader of to-day why the writers of the\r\nRestoration period should have always felt such an exuberant joy in the\r\nthought that a man's wife was unfaithful to him.  The common feeling of\r\nall men, even the men meant to be best, in the plays of Wycherley and\r\nVanbrugh, seems one that might find expression in some such words as\r\nthese: \"I should like to seduce every pretty married woman if I could,\r\nbut if I have not time or chance for such delight it is at least a\r\ngreat pleasure and comfort to me to know that she has been seduced by\r\nsomebody; it is always a source of glee to me to know that a husband\r\nhas been deceived; and, if the husband himself comes to know it too,\r\nthat makes my joy all the greater.\"  The delight in sin seems to have\r\nmade men in a certain sinful sense unselfish.  They delighted so in\r\nvice that they were glad to hear of its existence even where it brought\r\nthem no direct personal gratification.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1737--Audacious attempt a black-mailing]\r\n\r\nAll this had changed in the days of George the Second.  There had been\r\na gradual and marked improvement in the moral tone of the drama,\r\nunaccompanied, it must be owned, by any very decided improvement in the\r\nmoral tone of society.  Perhaps the main difference between the time of\r\nthe Restoration and that of the early Georges is that the vice of the\r\nRestoration was wanton school-boy vice, and that of the early Georges\r\nthe vice of mature and practical men.  In the Restoration time people\r\ndelighted in showing off their viciousness and making a frolic and a\r\nparade of it; at the time of the Georges they took their profligacy in\r\na quiet, practical, man-of-the-world sort of way, and made no work\r\nabout it.  One effect of this difference was felt in the greater\r\ndecorum, the greater comparative decorum, of the Georgian drama.\r\n\r\nYet this was the time when Walpole thought it necessary to introduce a\r\nmeasure putting the stage under new {95} and severe restrictions.\r\nWalpole himself cared nothing about literature, and nothing about the\r\ndrama; and he was as little squeamish as man could possibly be in the\r\nmatter of plain-spoken indecency.  What troubled him was not the\r\nindecency of the stage, but its political innuendo.  It never occurred\r\nto him to care whether anything said in Drury Lane or Covent Garden\r\nbrought a blush to the cheek of any young person; but he was much\r\nconcerned when he heard of anything said there which was likely to make\r\npeople laugh at a certain elderly person.  As we have seen, he had\r\nnever got the best of it in the long war of pamphlets and squibs and\r\nepigrams and caricature.  It was out of his power to hire penmen who\r\ncould stand up against such antagonists as Swift and Bolingbroke and\r\nPulteney.  He was out of humor with the press; had been out of humor\r\nwith it for a long time; and now he began to be out of humor with the\r\nstage.  Indeed, it should rather be said that he was now falling into a\r\nnew fit of ill-humor with the stage; for he had been very angry indeed\r\nwith Gay for his \"Beggars' Opera,\" and for the attempt at a\r\ncontinuation of \"The Beggars' Opera\" in the yet more audacious \"Polly,\"\r\nwhich brought in more money to Gay from its not having been allowed to\r\nget on the stage than its brilliant predecessor had done after all its\r\nunexampled run.  The measure of Walpole's wrath was filled by the\r\nknowledge that a piece was in preparation in which he was to be held up\r\nto public ridicule in the rudest and most uncompromising way.  Walpole\r\nacted with a certain boldness and cunning.  The play was brought to\r\nhim, was offered for sale to him.  This was an audacious attempt at\r\nblack-mailing; and at first it appeared to be successful.  Walpole\r\nagreed to the terms, bought the play, paid the money, and then\r\nproceeded at once to make the fact that such a piece had been written,\r\nand but for his payment might have been played, an excuse for the\r\nintroduction of a measure to put the whole English stage under\r\nrestriction, and to brand it with terms of shame.  He picked out\r\ncarefully all the worst passages, {96} and had them copied, and sent\r\nround in private to the leading members of all parties in the House of\r\nCommons, and appealed to them to support him in passing a measure which\r\nhe justified in advance by the illustrations of dramatic licentiousness\r\nthus brought under their own eyes.  By this mode of action he secured\r\nbeforehand an amount of support which made the passing of his Bill a\r\nmatter of almost absolute certainty.  Under these favorable conditions\r\nhe introduced his Playhouse Bill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1737--The Press and the Theatre]\r\n\r\nThe Playhouse Bill was a measure that attracted much attention, and\r\nprovoked a very fierce controversy.  It was a Bill to explain and amend\r\nso much of an Act made in the twelfth year of the reign of Queen Anne,\r\nentitled \"An Act for reducing the laws relating to rogues, vagabonds,\r\nsturdy beggars, and vagrants, and sending them whither they ought to be\r\nsent,\" as relates to the common players of interludes.  One clause\r\nempowered the Lord Chamberlain to prohibit the representation of any\r\ntheatric performance, and compelled all persons to send copies of new\r\nplays, or new parts or prologues or epilogues added to old plays,\r\nfourteen days before performance, in order that they might be submitted\r\nto the Lord Chamberlain for his permission or prohibition.  Every\r\nperson who set up a theatre, or gave a theatrical exhibition, without\r\nhaving a legal settlement in the place where the exhibition was given,\r\nor authority by letters-patent from the Crown, or a license from the\r\nLord Chamberlain, was to be deemed a rogue and vagabond, and subject to\r\nthe penalties liberally doled out to such homeless offenders.  The\r\nsystem of license thus virtually established by Walpole is the same\r\nthat prevails in our own day.  We do not, indeed, stigmatize managers\r\nand actors as rogues and vagabonds, even if they should happen to give\r\na theatrical performance without the fully ascertained permission of\r\nthe authorities, and we no longer keep up the monopoly of what used to\r\nbe called the patent theatres.  But the principle of Walpole's Act is\r\nthe principle of our present system.  A play must have the permission\r\nof the Lord Chamberlain before {97} it can be put on the stage; and\r\nwhile it is in course of performance the Lord Chamberlain can insist on\r\nany amendments or alterations in the dialogue or in the dresses which\r\nhe believes necessary in the interest of public morality.  A manager\r\nis, therefore, put under conditions quite different from those which\r\nsurround a publisher; an actor is fenced in by preliminary restrictions\r\nwhich do not trouble an author.  There is no censorship of the press;\r\nthere is a censorship of the theatre.  If a publisher brings out any\r\nbook which is grossly indecent or immoral or blasphemous, he can be\r\nprosecuted, and if a conviction be obtained he can of course be\r\npunished.  But there is no way of preventing him from bringing out the\r\nbook; there is no authority which has to be appealed to beforehand for\r\nits sanction.\r\n\r\n\"Is this right?\"  The question is still asked, Why should the people of\r\nthese countries submit to a censorship of the press?  What can be the\r\ncomparison between the harm done by a play which is seldom seen more\r\nthan once by the same person, and is likely to be forgotten a week\r\nafter it is seen, and the evil done by a bad book which finds its way\r\ninto households, and lies on tables, and may be read again and again\r\nuntil its poison has really corrupted the mind?  Again, a parent is\r\nalmost sure to exercise some caution when he is taking his children to\r\na theatre.  He will find out beforehand what the play is like, and\r\nwhether it is the sort of performance his daughter ought to see.  But\r\nit is out of the question to suppose that a parent will be able to read\r\nbeforehand every book that comes into his house in order to make sure\r\nthat it contains nothing which is unfit for a girl to study.  Why then\r\nnot have a censorship of the press as well as of the theatre, or why\r\nhave the one if you will not have the other?  The answer to the first\r\nquestion is that a censorship of the press is impossible in England.\r\nThe multitude of publications forbids it.  The most imaginative person\r\nwould find his imagination fail him if he tried to realize in his mind\r\nthe idea of the British public waiting for its morning {98} newspaper\r\nseveral hours while the censor was crawling over its columns to find\r\nout whether they contained anything that could bring a blush to the\r\ncheek of a young person.  It would be ridiculous to put in force a\r\ncensorship for books which had no application to newspapers.  But it is\r\nquite easy to maintain a certain form of censorship over the theatres.\r\nThe number of plays brought out in a year is comparatively small.  The\r\npreparation for each new play after it has been written and has passed\r\naltogether out of its author's hands must necessarily take some time,\r\nand there is hardly any practical inconvenience, therefore, in its\r\nbeing submitted to the Lord Chamberlain for his approval.  But then\r\ncomes the question, Is the censorship of any use?  Are we any the\r\nbetter for having it?  Should we not get on just as well without it?\r\nThe answer, as it seems to us, ought to be that the censorship is on\r\nthe whole of some use; that we are better with it than without it.  It\r\nwould be idle to contend that it is of any great service to public\r\nmorality in the higher sense, but is certainly of considerable\r\nadvantage as a safeguard to public decency and decorum.  The censorship\r\nof the stage in England to-day does not pretend to be a guardian of\r\npublic morality.  In all that relates to the higher moral law the\r\npublic must take care of itself.  Let us give one or two illustrations.\r\nMany sincere and not unintelligent persons firmly believe that the\r\ncause of public morality is injured by the representation of any play\r\nin which vice of a certain kind is brought under public notice, even\r\nthough the object of the play may be to condemn the vice it exposes;\r\nbut no censor of plays now would think of refusing to permit the\r\nperformance of \"Othello\" on that account.  To take a lower\r\nillustration: many people believe, and on better ground, that such a\r\npiece as \"The Lady of Lyons\" is injurious to public morals, because in\r\nthat play the man who makes himself a leading actor in an infamous\r\nfraud becomes glorified into a hero and wins fame, fortune, and wife in\r\nthe end.  But no censor would think of refusing to allow the\r\nperformance of \"The Lady of Lyons.\"  The {99} censor regards it as his\r\nduty to take care that indecent words are not spoken, and that what\r\nsociety considers indecent dressing is not exhibited.  That is not\r\nmuch, it may be said, but it is better than nothing, and it is all we\r\ncan get or would have.  The censor cannot go ahead of the prevailing\r\nhabits and the common opinion of the society of his day.  If we had a\r\ncensor who started a lofty code of morality and propriety all his own,\r\npublic opinion would not stand him and his code.  Suppose we had a\r\ncensor who considered \"Othello\" shocking, and an ordinary _décolletée_\r\ndress or an ordinary ballet costume indecent, an outcry would soon be\r\nraised against him which would compel him to resign his purposes or his\r\noffice.  All he can do is to endeavor to order things so that nothing\r\nis said or exhibited which might shock society's sense of propriety,\r\nand this he can as a rule fairly accomplish.  He must also take his\r\nsociety as he finds it.  A West End audience in London will stand\r\nallusions and jests and scantiness of costume which an East End\r\naudience, made up almost exclusively of the working-people and the\r\npoor, would not endure for a moment.  The censor of plays can be much\r\nmore rigid in his discipline when he is protecting the proprieties of\r\npoverty than when he is protecting the proprieties of fashion.  The\r\ncensorship works well in England on the whole, because it has almost\r\nalways been worked by capable men of the world who understand that they\r\nare not dealing with children, who do not magnify their office, and do\r\nnot strain after an austere authority which it would be quite\r\nimpossible for them to exert.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1737--The Playhouse Bill]\r\n\r\nThe Playhouse Bill passed through the House of Commons easily enough.\r\nNo one of any mark took much account of it, except Pulteney, who\r\nopposed it.  The opposition offered by Pulteney does not appear to have\r\nbeen very severe or even serious, for no division was taken in the\r\nrepresentative Chamber.  The feeling of every one was not so much\r\nconcerned about what we should now call immorality or indecency, but\r\nabout lampoons on public men.  This fear was common to the Opposition\r\nas well as to the {100} Government, was shared alike by the Patriots\r\nand the Court party; and so the Bill was sent speedily through both\r\nHouses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1737--The censorship of the stage]\r\n\r\nThe debate was made memorable by the brilliant speech of Lord\r\nChesterfield in the House of Lords.  All contemporary accounts agree in\r\ndescribing this speech as one of the most fascinating and impressive\r\never heard in Parliament.  Chesterfield strongly opposed the measure in\r\nthe interests of public liberty and the freedom of the press.  He knew\r\nwhere to hit hard when he called the licensing department which the\r\nBill proposed to create \"a new excise.\"  The real object of the\r\nmeasure, he insisted, was not so much to restrain the stage as to\r\nshackle the press.  \"It is an arrow that does but glance at the stage;\r\nthe mortal wound seems destined against the liberty of the press.\"  His\r\nargument to this effect was decidedly clever, keen, plausible, and\r\ntelling.  \"You can prevent a play from being acted,\" he said, \"but you\r\ndo not prevent it from being printed.  Therefore a play which by your\r\ncensorship you refuse to allow to come on the stage, and in the\r\ninterests of public morals very properly refuse, you allow to come in a\r\nprinted form on the shelves of the booksellers.  The very fact that a\r\nplay was not allowed to be put on the stage will only make people the\r\nmore eager to read it in book form; prohibited publications are in all\r\ncountries diligently and generally sought after.  Plays will be written\r\nin order to be prohibited by the censor and then to be sold in book\r\nform.  What will come of this?  Unquestionably an extension of the\r\npresent measure for the purpose of preventing the printing as well as\r\nthe public representation of plays.  It is out of the question that\r\nsociety could allow a play to be read by all the public which it would\r\nnot allow to be recited on the boards of a theatre.  Now then you have\r\ngot so far as the preventing of plays from being printed, what happens\r\nnext?  That a writer will turn his rejected, prohibited play into a\r\nnovel or something of the kind; will introduce a little narrative as\r\nwell as dialogue, and in this slightly {101} altered form offer his\r\npiece of scandalous work to the general reader.  Then it will be asked,\r\nWhat! will you allow an infamous libel to be printed and dispersed\r\nmerely because it does not bear the title of a play?  Thus, my Lords,\r\nfrom the precedent before us, we may, we shall be induced, nay, we can\r\nfind no reason for refusing to lay the press under a general license,\r\nand then we may bid adieu to the liberties of Great Britain.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal of force and of justice in Chesterfield's\r\nreasoning.  But its defect was that it made no account of the amount of\r\ncommon-sense which must go to the administration of law in every\r\nprogressive country.  If the censorship of the stage had been worked in\r\nthe spirit and style which Chesterfield expected, then it is beyond\r\nquestion that it would have to be followed up by a censorship of the\r\npress or withdrawn altogether.  It would clearly be impossible to allow\r\nthe very words which were not to be spoken on the stage to be set out\r\nin the clearest type on the shelves of every bookseller.  But\r\nChesterfield's own speech showed that he had entirely misconceived the\r\nextent and operation of a censorship of the stage in a country like\r\nEngland.  The censorship of the stage which Chesterfield assumed to be\r\ncoming, and which he condemned, could not possibly, as we have shown,\r\nexist in those islands.  The censorship of the stage, if it were to\r\nmove in such a direction, would not be paving the way for a censorship\r\nof the press, but simply paving the way for its own abolition.  The\r\nspeech was a capital and a telling piece of argument addressed to an\r\naudience who were glad to hear something decided and animated on the\r\nsubject; but it never could have deceived Chesterfield himself.  It\r\ntook no account of the elementary political fact that all legislation\r\nis compromise, and that the supposed logical and extreme consequences\r\nof no measure are ever allowed to follow its enactment.  The censorship\r\nof plays has gone on since that time, and it has not interfered with\r\nthe general liberty of acting and of publishing dramatic pieces.  It\r\nhas not compelled {102} Parliament to choose between introducing a\r\ncensorship of the press or abolishing the censorship of plays.  We have\r\nnever heard of any play worth seeing which was lost to the English\r\nstage through the censorship of the drama, nor was the suggestion ever\r\nmade by the most reactionary Ministry that it should be followed up by\r\na censorship of the press.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1737--Educated libellers]\r\n\r\nIndeed in Walpole's day it might almost have seemed as if the stage\r\nrequired censorship less than the ballad.  Probably, if it had been\r\nthought humanly possible to prevent the publication and the circulation\r\nof scurrilous poems against eminent men and women, Walpole might have\r\nventured on the experiment.  But he had too much robust common-sense\r\nnot to recognize the impossibility of doing anything effective in the\r\nway of repression in that field of art.\r\n\r\nCertainly the Muse of Song made herself very often a shrieking sister\r\nin those days.  When she turned her attention to politics, and had her\r\npatrons to be sung up and her patrons' enemies to be sung down, she\r\nvery often screamed and called names, and cursed like an intoxicated\r\nfish-wife.  Pope, Swift, Gay, Hervey, flung metrical abuse about in the\r\ncoarsest fashion.  There seemed to be hardly any pretence at accuracy\r\nof description or epithet.  If the poet or the poet's patron did not\r\nlike a man or woman, no word of abuse was too coarse or foul to be\r\nemployed against the odious personage.  Women, indeed, got off rather\r\nworse than men on the whole; even Lord Hervey did not suffer so much at\r\nthe hands of Pope as did Mary Wortley Montagu.  The poets of one\r\nfaction did not spare even the princes and princesses, even the King or\r\nQueen, of another.  Furious and revolting lines were written about\r\nGeorge and his wife by one set of versifiers; about the Prince of Wales\r\nby another.  No hour, no event, was held sacred.  Around a death-bed\r\nthe wits were firing off their sarcasms on its occupant.  Some of the\r\nverses written about Queen Caroline, verses often containing the\r\nfoulest and filthiest libels, followed her into the sick-chamber, {103}\r\nthe bed of death, the coffin, and the grave.  One could easily\r\nunderstand all this if the libellers had been vulgar and venal Grub\r\nStreet hacks who were paid to attack some enemy of their paymaster.\r\nBut the vilest calumnies of the time were penned by men of genius, by\r\nmen of the highest rank in literature; by men whose literary position\r\nmade them the daily companions of great nobles and of princes and\r\nprincesses.  Political and social hatred seemed to level all\r\ndistinctions and to obliterate most of the Christian virtues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{104}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE BANISHED PRINCE.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1737--An important affair]\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the Prince of Wales was becoming more and more insolent\r\nto the King and Queen every day.  Perhaps King George was right in his\r\nbelief that Walpole's policy of compromise had made Frederick think\r\nhimself of some real account in public affairs.  It is certain that he\r\nbegan to act as if he were determined the whole nation should know how\r\nthoroughly independent he was of the authority of his father and\r\nmother.  He had soon a peculiar opportunity of making a display of this\r\nferocious independence.\r\n\r\nThe Princess of Wales was about to have her first child.  For some\r\nreason, which no one could well explain, the news of the coming event\r\nwas not made known to the King and Queen until the hour of its coming\r\nwas very near.  Even then there seems to have been some conscious or\r\nunconscious misleading of the King and Queen as to the actual time when\r\naccording to calculations the child was to be born.  The King and Queen\r\nwere left under the impression that it was a good deal further off than\r\nit really proved to be.  The Queen, with all her natural goodness of\r\nheart, was painfully suspicious.  She was suspicious sometimes even of\r\nthose she loved and trusted; and she hated both the Prince and the\r\nPrincess of Wales.  She had taken it into her head that the Princess of\r\nWales was not likely to have a child.  She persisted in asserting to\r\nthose around her that the princess was not pregnant and never would be.\r\nNaturally when she allowed her mind to be filled with this idea, the\r\nnext conclusion for her to jump at was the conviction that a\r\nsupposititious infant was about to be palmed off on the Palace and the\r\n{105} country.  This idea took full possession of her mind, and she\r\nkept constantly telling those around her that, no matter when or where\r\nthe event might take place, she was determined to be in at that birth.\r\nIn the most explicit and emphatic way she told people that she would\r\nmake sure for herself that no child was imported in a warming-pan this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe King and Queen were now in Hampton Court Palace; the Prince and\r\nPrincess of Wales were also living there.  Nothing would have been\r\neasier for the Queen than to carry out her purpose if the princess were\r\nallowed to remain in the palace until after her confinement.  It was\r\nreported to her that the prince had said he was anxious that his wife\r\nshould be confined in London--in St. James's Palace.  This the Queen\r\nwas determined to prevent if she could.  The Princess Caroline fully\r\nshared her mother's belief that the Prince of Wales was quite capable\r\nof palming off a spurious child on the country; and indeed the King\r\nbecame after a while as well convinced of it as his wife and his\r\ndaughter.  It was resolved that a message should be sent from the King\r\nto the Prince of Wales, giving a sort of Royal command that the\r\nprincess should remain at Hampton Court until after her confinement.\r\nLord Hervey shook his head at all this.  He did not believe in the\r\nwarming-pan fantasy; and he felt sure that in any case the Prince of\r\nWales would contrive to get his wife out of Hampton Court if he wished\r\nto do so.  What was to prevent the princess going up to London a little\r\nbefore her time, and then affecting to fall suddenly ill there, and\r\ndeclaring that she could not endure the pain and danger of removal?\r\nLord Hervey had seen a good deal of the prince in old days.  They had\r\nhad friendships and quarrels and final estrangement, and he knew his\r\nprince pretty well.\r\n\r\nWhat Hervey had predicted came to pass, but in a worse way than he had\r\nventured to predict.  The Queen kept urging Walpole to send the King's\r\norder to the prince.  Walpole kept putting it off.  For one reason, the\r\n{106} minister had been told the confinement was to be expected in\r\nOctober, and this was only July.  It is very likely, too, that he\r\nshared Hervey's scepticism alike as to the supposititious child and the\r\npossibility of keeping the prince's wife at Hampton Court against the\r\nprince's will.  The Royal command was never sent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1737--Neighbors requisitioned]\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, July 31, 1737, the Prince of Wales and the princess dined\r\npublicly with the King and Queen in Hampton Court Palace.  Not a word\r\nwas said to any one about an early approach of the confinement.  The\r\nprincess seemed in her usual condition.  The two sets of royal\r\npersonages did not talk with each other at this time, although they\r\nthus had ceremonial meetings in public.  The Queen called the attention\r\nof some one near her to the princess's appearance, and insisted that\r\nshe was not going to have a child at all.  When dinner was over, the\r\nprince and princess went back to their own apartments, and later that\r\nevening the princess was taken with the pains of labor.  Then followed\r\nwhat has hardly ever happened in the story of the life of a poor\r\nwasher-woman or a peasant's wife.  The unfortunate princess was far\r\ngone in her agony before any one had time to think; and before those\r\naround them had much time to think the Prince of Wales had determined\r\nto carry her off, groaning in labor as she was, and take her ten miles\r\nto London.  The whole story is a shocking one; and we shall put it into\r\na very narrow compass.  But it has to be told somehow.  By the help of\r\nan equerry and a dancing-master, the writhing princess was hoisted\r\ndown-stairs and got into a carriage.  The dancing-master, Dunoyer, was\r\na hanger-on and favorite of the prince; and, being employed to teach\r\ndancing to the younger children of George the Second, acted as a kind\r\nof licensed spy, so Hervey says, on the one family and the other.  In\r\nthe carriage with the prince and princess came Lady Archibald Hamilton,\r\nwho was understood to be the prince's mistress.  No royal movement in\r\nthose days would seem to be thought quite complete without the presence\r\nof some mistress of the {107} King or prince.  The carriage reached\r\nLondon about ten o'clock.  It had been driven at full gallop, the poor\r\nprincess writhing and screaming all the time, and the prince scolding\r\nat her and telling her it was nonsense to cry and groan about pain\r\nwhich would so soon be over.  When they got to St. James's Palace there\r\nwere naturally no preparations made for a lying-in.  The prince and\r\nLady Archibald Hamilton set to work to get some things in readiness,\r\nand found they had to send round the neighborhood to collect some of\r\nthe most necessary appliances for such an occasion.  So pitifully\r\nunprovided was the palace that no clean sheets could be found, and the\r\nprince and his mistress put the princess to bed between two\r\ntable-cloths.  At a quarter before eleven the birth took place.  A tiny\r\nbaby was born; \"a little rat of a girl,\" Lord Hervey says, \"about the\r\nbigness of a good large tooth-pick.\"  The little rat of a girl grew up,\r\nhowever, to be a handsome woman.  She was seen by John Wilson Croker in\r\n1809 and had still the remains of beauty.  The Lords of the Council had\r\nbeen hurriedly sent for to be present at the birth; but the event was\r\nso sudden and so unexpected that only Lord Wilmington, the President of\r\nthe Council, and Lord Godolphin, the Privy Seal, arrived in time to be\r\nable to testify that no warming-pan operation was accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe unsuspecting King and Queen had gone to bed, according to their\r\nusual quiet custom, at eleven o'clock.  Their feelings, as a certain\r\nclass of writers are in the habit of saying, may be more easily\r\nimagined than described when they were roused from sleep about two in\r\nthe morning by the couriers, who came to tell them that the princess\r\nhad become the mother of a girl, and that the prince and princess were\r\nat St. James's Palace, London.  There was racing and chasing.  Within\r\nhalf an hour the Queen was on the road to London with the two eldest\r\nprincesses, Lord Hervey, and others.  The Queen comported herself with\r\nsome patience and dignity when she saw the prince and princess.  The\r\nchild was shown to her.  {108} No clothes had yet been found for it but\r\nsome napkins and an old red cloak.  \"The good God bless you, poor\r\nlittle creature,\" said the Queen in French; \"you have come into a very\r\ndisagreeable world!\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1737--Applying a precedent]\r\n\r\nThe King and Queen consented to become the godfather and godmother of\r\nthe poor little creature who had been brought thus disagreeably into\r\nthis disagreeable world.  But the conduct of the prince was regarded as\r\nunpardonable, and he was banished by Royal letter from the King's\r\npalace, whether at Hampton Court or St. James's.  The prince's own\r\nparty, Pulteney and his colleagues, utterly refused to give their\r\nsanction to the extraordinary course which Frederick had taken.\r\nBolingbroke wrote from France, angrily and scornfully condemning it.\r\nBut the Patriots were willing, and resolved to stand the prince's\r\nfriends all the same, and they had not even the courage to advise him\r\nto make a frank and full apology for his conduct.  Indeed the action of\r\nthe prince seems to suggest an approach to insanity rather than\r\ndeliberate and reasoned perverseness.  He had forced his wife to run\r\nthe risk of losing her own life and her child's life, he had grossly\r\nand wantonly offended his father and mother, and he had thrown a\r\nsecrecy and mystery round the birth of the infant which, if ever there\r\ncame to be a dispute about the succession, would give his enemies the\r\nmost plausible excuse for proclaiming that a spurious child had been\r\nimposed upon the country.  As a friend of the Queen said at the time,\r\nif ever the Crown came to be fought for again, the only question could\r\nbe whether the people would rather have the Whig bastard or the Tory\r\nbastard.\r\n\r\nThe whole business, as might be expected, caused a terrible scandal.\r\nNot merely was the prince banished from the palace, not merely did the\r\nKing refuse to see him or to hold further communication with him, but\r\nit was formally announced by the Secretaries of State to all the\r\nforeign ministers that it would be considered a mark of respect to the\r\nSovereign if they would abstain from visiting the prince.  Furthermore,\r\na message was sent in {109} writing to all peers, peeresses, and privy\r\ncouncillors, declaring that no one who went to the prince's court would\r\nbe admitted into the King's presence.  Never probably was domestic\r\ndirty linen more publicly washed.  Nevertheless, it very soon was made\r\napparent that the course taken by the King was in strict accordance\r\nwith a precedent which at one time had a very direct application to\r\nhimself.  Some of the prince's friends thought it a clever stroke of\r\npolicy just then to print and publish the letters which passed between\r\nthe late King and the present Sovereign when the latter was Prince of\r\nWales and got into a quarrel with his father.  The late King sent his\r\nvice-chamberlain to order his son \"that he and his domestics must leave\r\nmy house.\"  A copy was also published of a circular letter signed by\r\nthe honored name of Joseph Addison, then Secretary of State, addressed\r\nto the English ministers at foreign courts, giving the King's version\r\nof the whole quarrel, in order that they might report him and his cause\r\naright to the unsatisfied.\r\n\r\nLord Hervey is inclined to think that it was not the friends of the\r\nprince, but rather Walpole himself, who got these letters printed.\r\nHervey does not see what good the publication could do to the prince\r\nand the prince's cause, but suggests that it might be a distinct\r\nservice to Walpole and Walpole's master to show that the reigning king\r\nin his early days had been treated with even more harshness than he had\r\njust shown to his own son, and with far less cause to justify the\r\nharshness.  Still it seems to us natural for the prince's friends to\r\nbelieve it would strengthen him in popular sympathy if it were brought\r\nbefore men's minds that the very same sort of treatment of which George\r\nthe Second complained when it was visited on him by his own father he\r\nnow had not scrupled nor shamed to visit upon his son.  Among other\r\ndiscoveries made at this time with regard to the more secret history of\r\nthe late reign, it was found out that George the First actually\r\nentertained and encouraged a project for having the Prince of Wales,\r\nnow George the Second, put on board {110} some war-vessel and \"carried\r\noff to any part of the world that your Majesty may be pleased to\r\norder.\"  This fact--for a fact it seems to be--did not get to the\r\npublic knowledge; but it came to the knowledge of Lord Hervey, who\r\nprobably had it from the Queen herself, and it is confirmed by other\r\nand different testimony.  A Prince of Wales kidnapped and carried out\r\nof civilization by the command of his royal father would have made a\r\npiquant chapter in modern English history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1737--Bishop Hoadley and the Test Act]\r\n\r\nThe prince and princess went to Kew in the first instance, and then the\r\nprince took Norfolk House, in St. James's Square, for his town\r\nresidence, and Cliefden for his country place.  The prince put himself\r\nforward more conspicuously than ever as the head of the Patriot party.\r\nIt was reported to Walpole that in Frederick's determination to make\r\nhimself popular he was resolved to have a Bill brought forward in the\r\ncoming session of Parliament to repeal the Test Act.  The Test Act was\r\npassed in the reign of Charles the Second, 1673, and it declared that\r\nall officers, civil or military, of the Government must take the\r\nsacrament according to the forms of the Church of England, and must\r\ntake the oaths against the doctrine of transubstantiation.  This Act\r\nwas, of course, regarded as a serious grievance by the Dissenters of\r\nall denominations.  Some few eminent Churchmen, like Dr. Hoadley,\r\nBishop of Winchester, had always been opposed to the narrow-minded\r\npolicy of the Act.  Hoadley, indeed, had made himself a sort of leader\r\nof the dissenting communities on this subject.  For that and other\r\nreasons he had been described as the greatest Dissenter who ever wore a\r\nmitre.  When the report got about that an attempt was to be made to\r\nhave the Test Act repealed, Walpole, with his usual astuteness, sent\r\nfor the bishop, knowing very well that, if such a determination had\r\nbeen come to, Dr. Hoadley would be among the very first men to be\r\nconsulted on the subject.  Walpole expressed his mind very freely to\r\nHoadley.  A coldness had long existed between them, which Walpole's\r\ngift of the Bishopric of Winchester had not removed.  {111} Hoadley had\r\nthought Walpole slow, lukewarm, and indifferent about movements in\r\nreform of Church and State, which Hoadley regarded as essential parts\r\nof the programme of the Whig party.  Walpole was perfectly frank with\r\nhim on this occasion, and explained to him the difficulty which would\r\ncome up in English affairs if the Prince of Wales were encouraged to\r\nseek popularity at the expense of the King and Queen by making himself\r\nthe champion of the Dissenters' grievances.  Hoadley met Walpole in a\r\nspirit of similar frankness.  He declared that he always had been and\r\nalways should be in favor of the repeal of the Test Act, but that he\r\ndisapproved altogether of the prince being set up in opposition to the\r\nKing; and he believed that even the repeal of the Test Act would be\r\nbought at too dear a cost if it were the means of bringing the King\r\ninto a distressing family quarrel.  Therefore the bishop declared that\r\nhe would give no encouragement to such a scheme, of which, he said, he\r\nhad lately heard nothing from the prince; and that, whatever kindnesses\r\nhe might receive from Frederick, he should never forget his duty to\r\nGeorge.  Walpole was delighted with Hoadley's bearing and Hoadley's\r\nanswer, and seemed as if he never could praise him enough.  No one can\r\nquestion Hoadley's sincerity.  We must only try to get ourselves back\r\ninto the framework and the spirit of an age when a sound patriot and a\r\nhigh-minded ecclesiastic could be willing to postpone indefinitely an\r\nact of justice to a whole section of the community in order to avoid\r\nthe risk of having the Sovereign brought into disadvantageous\r\ncomparison with the Sovereign's eldest son.  Walpole approved of the\r\nTest Act no more than Hoadley did, although the spirit of his objection\r\nto it was far less positive and less exalted than that of Hoadley.  But\r\nWalpole was, of course, an avowed Opportunist; he never professed or\r\npretended to be anything better.  There is nothing surprising in the\r\nfact that he regarded an act of justice to the Dissenters as merely a\r\nmatter of public convenience, to be performed when it could be\r\nperformed without disturbing anybody of {112} importance.  Hoadley must\r\nhave looked at the subject from an entirely different point of view; it\r\nmust have been to him a question of justice or injustice; yet he, too,\r\nwas quite ready to put it off indefinitely rather than allow it to be\r\nmade the means of obtaining a certain amount of popular favor for the\r\nPrince of Wales as opposed to his father the King.  We shall see such\r\nthings occurring again and again in the course of this history.  The\r\nagreement of Walpole and Hoadley did, indeed, put off the repeal of the\r\nTest Act for a pretty long time.  The brand and stigma on the\r\nProtestant Dissenters as well as on the Roman Catholics was allowed to\r\nremain in existence for nearly another century of English history.  We\r\nare now in 1737, and the Test Act was not repealed until 1828.\r\nHistorians are sometimes reproached for paying too much attention to\r\npalace squabbles; yet a palace squabble becomes a matter of some\r\nimportance if it can postpone an act of national justice for by far the\r\ngreater part of a century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1737--A question of price]\r\n\r\nThere was a good deal of talk about this time of the possibility of\r\nadopting some arrangement for the separation of Hanover from the\r\nEnglish Crown.  The fact of the Princess of Wales having given birth to\r\na daughter and not a son naturally led to a revival of this question.\r\nThe electorate of Hanover could not descend to a woman, and if the\r\nPrince of Wales should have no son some new arrangement would have to\r\nbe made.  The Queen was very anxious that Hanover should be secured for\r\nher second son, to whom she was much attached, and the King was\r\nunderstood to be in favor of this project.  On the other hand, it was\r\ngiven out that the Prince of Wales would be quite willing to renounce\r\nhis rights in favor of his younger brother on condition of his getting\r\nthe fifty thousand a year additional for which he had been clamoring in\r\nParliament.  Nothing could be more popular with the country than any\r\narrangement which would sever the connection between the Crown of\r\nEngland and the electorate of Hanover.  If the prince were seeking\r\npopularity, such a proposal coming from him would be popular indeed,\r\nprovided {113} it were not spoiled by the stipulation about the fifty\r\nthousand a year.  The Queen's comment upon the rumors as to the\r\nprince's intention was that in her firm belief he would sell the\r\nreversion of the Crown of England to the Pretender if only the\r\nPretender offered him money enough.  Nothing came of the talk about\r\nHanover just then.  The King and the Queen had soon something else to\r\nthink of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{114}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE QUEEN'S DEATH-BED.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1737--Caroline's death-stroke]\r\n\r\nThe Queen had long been dying; dying by inches.  In one of her\r\nconfinements she had been stricken with an ailment from which she\r\nsuffered severely.  She refused to let any one, even the King, know\r\nwhat was the matter with her.  She had the strongest objection to being\r\nregarded as an invalid; and she feared, too, that if anything serious\r\nwere known to be the matter with her she might lose her hold over her\r\nselfish husband, who only cared for people as long as they were active\r\nin serving and pleasing him.  An invalid was to George merely a\r\nnuisance.  Let us do Caroline justice.  She was no doubt actuated by\r\nthe most sincere desire to be of service to the King, and she feared\r\nthat if she were to make it known how ill she was, the King might\r\ninsist on her giving up active life altogether.  Not only did she take\r\nno pains to get better, but in order to prove that she was perfectly\r\nwell, she used to exert herself in a manner which might have been\r\ninjurious to the health of a very strong woman.  When at Richmond she\r\nused to walk several miles every morning with the King; and more than\r\nonce, Walpole says, when she had the gout in her foot, she dipped her\r\nwhole leg in cold water to be ready to attend him.  \"The pain,\" says\r\nWalpole, \"the bulk, and the exercise threw her into such fits of\r\nperspiration as routed the gout; but those exertions hastened the\r\ncrisis of her distemper.\"  History preserves some curious pictures of\r\nthe manner in which the morning prayers were commonly said to Queen\r\nCaroline.  The Queen was being dressed by her ladies in her bedroom;\r\nthe door of the bedroom was left partly open, the {115} chaplain read\r\nthe prayers in the outer room, and had to kneel, as he read them,\r\nbeneath a great painting of a naked Venus; and just within the\r\nhalf-open bedroom door her Majesty, according to Horace Walpole, \"would\r\nfrequently stand some minutes in her shift, talking to her ladies.\"\r\n\r\nRobert Walpole was the first to discover the real and the very serious\r\nnature of the Queen's malady.  He was often alone with her for the\r\npurpose of arranging as to the course of action which they were to\r\nprevail upon the King to believe to be of his own inspiration, and\r\naccordingly to adopt.  Shortly after the death of Walpole's wife he was\r\ncloseted with the Queen.  Her Majesty questioned him closely about the\r\ncause of his wife's death.  She was evidently under the impression that\r\nLady Walpole had died from the effects of a peculiar kind of rupture,\r\nand she put to Walpole a variety of very intimate questions as to the\r\nsymptoms and progress of the disease.  Walpole had long suspected, as\r\nmany others had, that there was something seriously wrong with the\r\nQueen.  He allowed her to go on with her questions, and he became\r\nsatisfied in his own mind that the Queen herself was suffering from the\r\ndisorder about which she was so anxious to be told.\r\n\r\nOn August 26, 1737, it was reported over London that the Queen was\r\ndead.  The report was unfounded, or at least premature.  Caroline had\r\nhad a violent attack, but she rallied and was able to go about again at\r\nHampton Court with the King.  On Wednesday, November 9, 1737, she was\r\nsuddenly stricken down, and this was her death-stroke.  She did not die\r\nat once, but lingered and lingered.\r\n\r\nThere are few chapters of history more full of strange, sardonic\r\ncontrast, and grim, ghastly humor, than those which describe these\r\ndeath-bed scenes.  The Queen, undergoing a succession of painful\r\noperations; now groaning and fainting, now telling the doctors not to\r\nmind her foolish cries; now indulging in some chaff with them--\"Is not\r\nRanby [the surgeon] sorry it isn't his own cross old wife he is cutting\r\nup?\"--the King sometimes blubbering, and sometimes telling his dying\r\nwife that her staring eyes {116} looked like those of a calf whose\r\nthroat had been cut; the King, who, in his sudden tenderness and grief,\r\nwould persist in lying outside the bed, and thereby giving the poor,\r\nperishing sufferer hardly room to move; the messages of affected\r\ncondolence arriving from the Prince of Wales, with requests to be\r\nallowed to see his mother, which requests the mother rejects with\r\nbitterness and contempt--all this sets before us a picture such as\r\nseldom, happily for the human race, illustrates a death-bed in palace,\r\ngarret, or prison cell.  The King was undoubtedly sincere in his grief,\r\nat least for the time.  He did love the Queen in a sort of way; and she\r\nhad worked upon all his weaknesses and vices and made herself necessary\r\nto him.  He did not see how life was to go on for him without her; and\r\nas he thought of this he cried like a child whose mother is about to\r\nleave him.  Over and over again has the story been told of the dying\r\nQueen's appeal to her husband to take a new wife after her death, and\r\nthe King's earnest disclaimer of any such purpose; the assurance that\r\nhe would have mistresses, and then the Queen's cry of cruel conviction\r\nfrom hard experience, \"Oh, mon Dieu, cela n'empêche pas!\"  \"I know,\"\r\nsays Lord Hervey, who tells the story, \"that this episode will hardly\r\nbe credited, but it is literally true.\"  One does not see why the\r\nepisode should hardly be credited, why it should not be taken at once\r\nas historical and true.  It is not out of keeping with all other\r\npassages of the story, it is in the closest harmony and symmetry with\r\nthem.  The King always made his wife the confidante of his amours and\r\nintrigues.  He had written to her once, asking her to bring to Court\r\nthe wife of some nobleman or gentleman, and he told her frankly that he\r\nadmired this lady and wanted to have her near him in order that he\r\nmight have an intrigue with her, and he knew that she, his wife, would\r\nalways be glad to do him a pleasure.  Thackeray, in his lecture, often\r\nspeaks of the King as \"Sultan George.\"  George had, in the matter of\r\nlove-making, no other notions than those of a sultan.  [Sidenote:\r\n1737--George's settled belief] He had no more idea of his wife\r\nobjecting to his mistresses than {117} a sultan would have about the\r\nchief sultana's taking offence at the presence of his concubines.  The\r\nfact that the Queen lay dying did not put any restraint on any of\r\nGeorge's ways.  He could not be kept from talking loudly all the time;\r\nhe could not be kept from bawling out observations about his wife's\r\ncondition which, if they were made only in whispers, must have tended\r\nto alarm and distress an invalid.  It is not the frank brutality of\r\nGeorge's words which surprises us; it is rather the sort of cross-light\r\nthey throw on what was after all a tender part of his coarse and\r\nselfish nature.  Every reader of the history and the memoirs of that\r\nreign must be prepared to understand and to appreciate the absolute\r\nsincerity of the King's words; the settled belief that the Queen could\r\nnot possibly have any objection to his taking to himself as many\r\nmistresses as he pleased.  One is a little surprised at the uncouth\r\nsentimentality of the thought that nevertheless it might be a\r\ndisrespect to her memory if he were to take another wife.  What a light\r\nall this lets in upon the man, and the Court, and the time!  As regards\r\nindiscriminate amours and connections, poor, stupid, besotted George\r\nwas simply on a level with the lower animals.  Charles the Second,\r\nLouis the Fourteenth, Louis the Fifteenth even--these at their worst of\r\ntimes were gentlemen.  It was only at the Hanoverian Court of England\r\nthat such an interchange of appeal and reassurance could take place as\r\nthat which was murmured and blubbered over the death-bed of Queen\r\nCaroline.  \"Horror,\" says one of the great Elizabethan poets, \"waits on\r\nthe death-beds of princes.\"  Horror in the truest sense waited on the\r\ndeath-bed of that poor, patient, faithful, unscrupulous, unselfish\r\nQueen.\r\n\r\nThe Queen kept rallying and sinking, and rallying again; and the King's\r\nmoods went up and down with each passing change in his wife's\r\ncondition.  Now she sank, and he buried his face in the bedclothes and\r\ncried; now she recovered a little, and he rated at her and made rough\r\njokes at her.  At one moment he appeared to be all {118} tenderness to\r\nher, at another moment he went on as if the whole illness were a mere\r\nsham to worry him, and she might get up and be well if she would only\r\nact like a sensible woman.  The Prince of Wales made an attempt to see\r\nthe Queen.  The King spoke of him as a puppy and a scoundrel; jeered at\r\nhis impudent, affected airs of duty and affection, declared that\r\nneither he nor the Queen was in a condition to see him act his false,\r\nwhining, cringing tricks now, and sent him orders to get out of the\r\nplace at once.  His Majesty continued all through the dying scenes to\r\nrave against the Prince of Wales, and call him rascal, knave, puppy,\r\nand scoundrel.  The Queen herself, although she did not use language\r\nquite as strong, yet expressed just as resolute a dislike or\r\ndetestation of her son, and an utter disbelief in his sincerity.  She\r\ndeclared that she knew he only wanted to see her in order that he\r\nshould have the joy of knowing she was dead five minutes sooner than if\r\nhe had to wait in Pall Mall to hear the glad tidings.  She told the\r\nlisteners that if ever she should consent to see the prince they might\r\nbe sure she had lost her senses.  Princess Caroline was in constant\r\nattendance on the Queen.  So was Lord Hervey.  The princess, however,\r\nbecame unwell herself and the Princess Emily sat up with the Queen.\r\nBut Caroline would not consent to be removed from her mother.  A couch\r\nwas fitted up for her in a room adjoining the Queen's; and Lord Hervey\r\nlay on a mattress on the floor at the foot of the princess's bed.  The\r\nKing occasionally went to his own rooms, and there was peace for the\r\ntime in the dying woman's chamber.  Probably the only two that truly\r\nand unselfishly loved the Queen were occupying the couch and the\r\nmattress in that outer room.\r\n\r\nThe Queen talked often to Princess Caroline, and commended to her the\r\ncare of her two younger sisters.  She talked to her son William, Duke\r\nof Cumberland, then little more than sixteen years old, admonished him\r\nto be a support to his father, and to \"try to make up for the\r\ndisappointment and vexation he must receive from your {119} profligate\r\nand worthless brother.\"  But she also admonished him to attempt nothing\r\nagainst his brother, and only to mortify him by showing superior merit.\r\nShe asked for her keys, and gave them to the King.  She took off her\r\nfinger a ruby ring which he had given her at her coronation, and put it\r\non his finger, and said to him, almost as patient Grizzel does, \"Naked\r\nI came to you, and naked I go from you.\"  All who were present at this\r\nepisode in the dying were in tears, except the Queen herself.  She\r\nseemed absolutely composed; indeed she was anxious that the end should\r\ncome.  She had no belief in the possibility of her recovery, and she\r\nonly wanted to be released now from \"the fever called living.\"  Except\r\nfor the bitter outbursts of anger and hatred against the Prince of\r\nWales, the poor Queen seems to have borne herself like a true-hearted,\r\nresigned, tender wife, kind mother, and Christian woman.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1737--A fatal mistake]\r\n\r\nAn operation was tried, with the consent of the King.  Thereupon arises\r\na controversy not unlike that which followed an imperial death in very\r\nmodern European history.  Lord Hervey insists that the surgeons showed\r\nutter incapacity, made a shocking and fatal mistake; cut away as\r\nmortified flesh that in which there was no mortification whatever.\r\nThen Sir Robert Walpole, who had been sent for, comes on the scene.\r\nThe King ordered him to be brought in from the outer room, and Walpole\r\ncame in and tried to drop on his knees to kiss the King's hand.  It was\r\nnot easy to do, Sir Robert was so bulky and unwieldy.  He found it hard\r\nto get down, and harder still to get up again.  However, the solemn\r\nduty was accomplished somehow, and then Sir Robert was conducted to the\r\nQueen's bedside.  He dropped some tears, which we may be sure were\r\nsincere, even if by no means unselfish.  He was in utter dread of\r\nlosing all his power over the King if the Queen were to die.  The Queen\r\nrecommended the King, her children, and the kingdom to his care, and\r\nSir Robert seems to have been much pleased with the implied compliment\r\nof the recommendation.\r\n\r\n{120}\r\n\r\nThe moment Walpole got to private speech with Lord Hervey, he at once\r\nexhibited the nature of his grief and alarm.  \"My lord,\" he exclaimed,\r\n\"if this woman should die, what a scene of confusion will there be!\r\nWho can tell into whose hands the King will fall, or who will have the\r\nmanagement of him?\"  Lord Hervey tried to reassure him, and told him\r\nthat his influence over the King would be stronger than ever.  Walpole\r\ncould not see it, and they argued the matter over for a long time.  The\r\ntalk lasted two or three hours, much to Lord Hervey's dissatisfaction,\r\nfor it kept him out of bed, and this happened to be the first night\r\nsince the Queen had fallen ill when he had any chance of a good night's\r\nrest; and now behold, with the Prime-minister's unseasonable anxiety\r\nabout the affairs of State, Lord Hervey's chance is considerably\r\ndiminished.  Even this little episode has its fit and significant place\r\nin the death-bed story.  The Prime-minister will insist on talking over\r\nthe prospects--his own prospects or those of the nation--with the\r\nlord-in-waiting; and the lord-in-waiting is very sleepy, and, having\r\nhad a hope of a night's rest, is only alarmed lest the hope should be\r\ndisappointed.  No one appears to have said a word as to what would be\r\nbetter or worse for the Queen.\r\n\r\nThe Queen was strongly under the belief that she would die on a\r\nWednesday.  She was born on a Wednesday, married on a Wednesday,\r\ncrowned on a Wednesday, gave birth to her first child on a Wednesday;\r\nalmost all the important events of her life had befallen her on\r\nWednesday, and it seemed in the fitness of things that Wednesday should\r\nbring with it the close of that life.  Wednesday came; and, as Lord\r\nHervey puts it, \"some wise, some pious, and a great many busy,\r\nmeddling, impertinent people about the Court\" began asking each other,\r\nand everybody else they met, whether the Queen had any clergyman to\r\npray for her and minister to her.  Hervey thought all this very\r\noffensive and absurd, and was of opinion that if the Queen cared about\r\npraying, and that sort of thing, she could pray for herself as well as\r\nany one else could do it.  {121} Hervey, however, kept this free and\r\neasy view of things discreetly to himself.  He was shocked at the rough\r\ncynicism of Sir Robert Walpole, who cared as little about prayer as\r\nHervey or any other man living, but was perfectly willing that all the\r\nworld should know his views on the subject.  The talk of the people\r\nabout the Court reached Walpole's ears, and he recommended the Princess\r\nEmily to propose to the King and Queen that the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury should be sent for.  The princess seemed to be a little\r\nafraid to make so audacious a proposal to the King, Defender of the\r\nFaith, as the suggestion that a minister of the Church should be\r\nallowed to pray by the bedside of the dying Queen.  Sir Robert\r\nencouraged her in his characteristic way.  In the presence of a dozen\r\npeople, Hervey tells, Sir Robert said to the princess: \"Pray, madam,\r\nlet this farce be played; the archbishop will act it very well.  You\r\nmay bid him be as short as you will.  It will do the Queen no hurt, no\r\nmore than any good; and it will satisfy all the wise and good fools who\r\nwill call us atheists if we don't pretend to be as great fools as they\r\nare.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1737--Praying with the Queen]\r\n\r\nThe advice of the statesman was taken.  The wise and good fools were\r\nallowed to have it their own way.  The archbishop was sent for, and he\r\ncame and prayed with the Queen every morning and evening; the King\r\nalways graciously bolting out of the room the moment the prelate came\r\nin.  But the wise and good fools were not satisfied with the concession\r\nwhich enlightenment had condescended to make.  Up to this time they\r\nkept asking, \"Has the Queen no one to pray with her?\"  Now the\r\nwhispered question was, \"Has the Queen taken--will the Queen take--the\r\nsacrament?\"  Some people hinted that she could not receive the\r\nsacrament because she could not make up her mind to be reconciled to\r\nher son; others doubted whether she had religious feeling enough to\r\nconsent to ask for the sacrament or to receive it.  All this time the\r\nKing chattered perpetually to Lord Hervey, to the physicians and\r\nsurgeons, and to his children, about the virtues {122} and gifts of the\r\nQueen.  He deplored in advance the lonely, dull life he would have to\r\nlead when she was taken from him.  He was in frequent bursts of tears.\r\nHe declared that he had never been tired one moment in her company;\r\nthat he could never have been happy with any other woman in the world;\r\nand he paid her the graceful and delicate compliment of saying that if\r\nshe had not been his wife he would rather have her for a mistress than\r\nany other woman with whom he had ever held such relationship.  Yet he\r\nhardly ever went into her room, after one of these outpourings of\r\ntender affection, without being rough to her and shouting at her and\r\nbullying her.  When her pains and her wounds made her move uneasily in\r\nher bed, he asked her how the devil she could sleep when she would\r\nnever lie still a moment.  He walked heavily about the room as if it\r\nwere a chamber in a barrack; he talked incessantly; gave all manner of\r\ndirections; made the unfortunate Queen swallow all manner of foods and\r\ndrinks because he took it into his head that they would do her good;\r\nand she submitted, poor, patient, pitiable creature, and swallowed and\r\nvomited, swallowed again and vomited again, and uttered no complaint.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1737--Would not play second fiddle]\r\n\r\nEven in his outbursts of grief the King's absurd personal vanity\r\nconstantly came out; for he was always telling his listeners that the\r\nQueen was devoted to him because she was wildly enamoured of his person\r\nas well as his genius.  Then he told long stories about his own\r\nindomitable courage, and went over and over again an account of the\r\nheroism he had displayed during a storm at sea.  One night the King was\r\nin the outer room with the Princess Emily and Lord Hervey.  The puffy\r\nlittle King wore his nightgown and nightcap, and was sitting in a great\r\nchair with his thick legs on a stool; a heroic figure, decidedly.  The\r\nprincess was lying on a couch.  Lord Hervey sat by the fire.  The King\r\nstarted the old story of the storm and his own bravery, and gave it to\r\nhis companions in all its familiar details.  The princess at last\r\nclosed her eyes, and seemed to be fast asleep.  The King presently went\r\ninto {123} the Queen's room, and then the princess started up and\r\nasked, \"Is he gone?\" and added, fervently, \"How tiresome he is!\"  Lord\r\nHervey asked if she had not been asleep; she said no; she had only\r\nclosed her eyes in order to escape taking part in the conversation, and\r\nthat she very much wished she could close her ears as well.  \"I am sick\r\nto death,\" the dutiful princess said, \"of hearing of his great courage\r\nevery day of my life.  One thinks now of mamma, and not of him.  Who\r\ncares for his old storm?  I believe, too, it is a great lie, and that\r\nhe was as much afraid as I should have been, for all what he says now,\"\r\nand she added a good many more comments to the same effect.  Then the\r\nKing came back into the room, and his daughter ceased her comment on\r\nhis bravery and his truthfulness.\r\n\r\n\"One thinks of mamma, and not of him.\"  That was exactly what George\r\nwould not have.  He did dearly love the Queen after his own fashion; he\r\nwas deeply grieved at the thought of losing her; but he did not choose\r\nto play second fiddle even to the dying.  So in all his praises of her\r\nand his laments for her he never failed to endeavor to impress on his\r\nhearers the idea of his own immense superiority to her and to everybody\r\nelse.  There is hardly anything in fiction so touching, so pitiful, so\r\npainful, as this exposition of a naked, brutal, yet not quite selfish,\r\nnot wholly unloving, egotism.  The Queen did not die on the Wednesday.\r\nThursday and Friday passed over in just the same way, with just the\r\nsame incidents--with the King alternately blubbering and bullying, with\r\nthe panegyrics of the dying woman, and the twenty times told tale of\r\n\"his old storm.\"  The Queen was growing weaker and weaker.  Those who\r\nwatched around her bed wondered how she was able to live so long in\r\nsuch a condition of utter weakness.  On the evening of Sunday, November\r\n20th, she asked Dr. Tesier quietly how long it was possible that her\r\nstruggle could last.  He told her that he was \"of opinion that your\r\nMajesty will be soon relieved.\"  She thanked him for telling her, and\r\nsaid in French, \"So much the better.\"  About {124} ten o'clock that\r\nsame night the crisis came.  The King was asleep in a bed laid on the\r\nfloor at the foot of the Queen's bed.  The Princess Emily was lying on\r\na couch in a corner of the room.  The Queen began to rattle in her\r\nthroat.  The nurse gave the alarm, and said the Queen was dying.  The\r\nPrincess Caroline was sent for, and Lord Hervey.  The princess came in\r\ntime; Lord Hervey was a moment too late.  The Queen asked in a low,\r\nfaint voice that the window might be opened, saying she felt an asthma.\r\nThen she spoke the one word, \"Pray.\"  The Princess Emily began to read\r\nsome prayers, but had only got out a few words before the Queen\r\nshuddered and died.  The Princess Caroline held a looking-glass to the\r\nQueen's lips, and, finding the surface undimmed, quietly said, \"'Tis\r\nover\"; and, according to Lord Hervey, \"said not one word more, nor as\r\nyet shed one tear, on the arrival of a misfortune the dread of which\r\nhad cost her so many.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray!\"  That was the last word the Queen ever spoke, All the wisdom of\r\nthe Court statesmen, all the proud, intellectual unbelief, all the\r\ncynical contempt for the weaknesses of intellect which allow ignorant\r\npeople to believe their destiny linked with that of some other and\r\nhigher life--all that Bolingbroke, Chesterfield, Walpole, would have\r\ntaught and sworn oaths for--all was mocked by that one little word,\r\n\"pray,\" which came last from the lips of Queen Caroline.  Bring saucy\r\nScepticism there; make her laugh at that!\r\n\r\nThe story would be incomplete if it were not added that while the\r\nQueen's body was yet unburied the King came to Hervey and told him,\r\nlaughing and crying alternately, that he had just seen Horace Walpole,\r\nthe brother of Robert, and that Walpole was weeping for the Queen with\r\nso bad a grace \"that in the middle of my tears he forced me to burst\r\ninto laughter.\"  Amid this explosion of tears and laughter the story of\r\nthe Queen's life comes fittingly to an end.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1737--Walpole strengthens his position]\r\n\r\nThe moment the breath was out of the Queen's body, {125} Walpole set\r\nabout a course of action which should strengthen his position as\r\nPrime-minister of the King.  At first his strong fear was that with the\r\nlife of the Queen had passed away his own principal hold upon the\r\nconfidence of George.  He told Hervey that no one could know how often\r\nhe had failed utterly by argument and effort of his own to bring the\r\nKing to agree to some action which he considered absolutely necessary\r\nfor the good of the State, and how after he had given up the attempt in\r\nmere despair the Queen had taken the matter in hand, and so managed the\r\nKing that his Majesty at last became persuaded that the whole idea was\r\nhis own original conception, and he bade her send for Walpole and\r\nexplain it to him, and get Walpole to carry it into execution.  Hervey\r\nendeavored to reassure him by many arguments, and among the rest by one\r\nwhich showed how well Hervey understood King George's weaknesses.\r\nHervey said the one thing which was in Walpole's way while the Queen\r\nlived was the fear George had of people saying Walpole was the Queen's\r\nminister, not the King's, and suggesting that the King's policy was\r\nruled by his wife.  Now that the Queen was gone, George would be glad\r\nto prove to the world that Walpole had always been his minister, and\r\nthat he retained Walpole's services because he himself valued them, and\r\nnot because they had been pressed upon him by a woman.  Hervey proved\r\nto be right.\r\n\r\nWalpole, however, was for strengthening himself after the old fashion.\r\nHe was determined to put the King into the hands of some woman who\r\nwould play into the hands of the minister.  The Duke of Grafton and the\r\nDuke of Newcastle tried to persuade Walpole to make use of the\r\ninfluence of the Princess Emily.  They insisted that she was sure to\r\nsucceed to the management of the King, but that if Walpole approached\r\nher at once he might easily make her believe that she owed it all to\r\nhim, and that she might thus be induced to stand by him and to assist\r\nhim.  Walpole would have nothing of the kind.  He only believed in the\r\nruling power of a mistress now that the {126} Queen was gone.  He gave\r\nhis opinions in his blunt, characteristic way.  He meant, he said, to\r\nbring over Madame de Walmoden, and would have nothing to do with \"the\r\ngirls.\"  \"I was for the wife against the mistress, but I will be for\r\nthe mistress against the daughters.\"  Accordingly he earnestly advised\r\nthe King not to fret any longer with a vain sorrow, but to try to\r\ndistract himself from grief, and urged him, for this purpose, to send\r\nover at once to Hanover for Madame Walmoden.  Walpole's way of talking\r\nto the young princesses would seem absolutely beyond belief if we did\r\nnot know that the reports of it are true.  He told the princesses that\r\nthey must try to divert their father's melancholy by bringing women\r\nround him; he talked of Madame Walmoden, and repeated to them what he\r\nhad said to Lord Hervey, that, though he had been for the Queen against\r\nLady Suffolk and every other woman, yet now he would be for Madame\r\nWalmoden, and advised them in the mean time to bring Lady Deloraine, a\r\nformer mistress, to her father, adding with brutal indecency that\r\n\"people must wear old gloves until they get new ones.\"  He offended and\r\ndisgusted the Princesses Caroline and Emily, and they hated him forever\r\nafter.  Walpole did not much care.  He was not thinking much about \"the\r\ngirls,\" as he called them.  He believed he saw his way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{127} CHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nTHE WESLEYAN MOVEMENT.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1738--John Wesley]\r\n\r\nIn 1738 John Wesley returned to London from Georgia, in British North\r\nAmerica.  He had been absent more than two years.  He had gone to\r\nGeorgia to propagate the faith to which he was devoted; to convert the\r\nnative Indians and to regenerate the British colonists.  He did not\r\naccomplish much in either way.  The colonists preferred to live their\r\ncareless, joyous, often dissolute lives, and the stern spirit of Wesley\r\nhad no charm for them.  The Indians refused to be Christianized; one\r\nchief giving as his reason for the refusal a melancholy fact which has\r\nkept others as well as him from conversion to the true faith.  He said\r\nhe did not want to become a Christian because the Christians in\r\nSavannah got drunk, told lies, and beat men and women.  Wesley had,\r\nbefore leaving England, founded a small religious brotherhood, and on\r\nhis return he at once set to work to strengthen and enlarge it.\r\n\r\nJohn Wesley was in every sense a remarkable man.  If any one in the\r\nmodern world can be said to have had a distinct religious mission,\r\nWesley certainly can be thus described.  He was born in 1703 at\r\nEpworth, in Lincolnshire.  John Wesley came of a family distinguished\r\nfor its Churchmen and ministers.  His father was a clergyman of the\r\nChurch of England, and rector of the parish of Epworth; his grandfather\r\nwas also a clergyman, but became a Non-conformist minister, and seems\r\nto have been a good deal persecuted for his opinions on religious\r\ndiscipline.  John Wesley's father was a sincere and devout man, with a\r\ncertain literary repute and well read in {128} theology, but of narrow\r\nmind and dogmatic, unyielding temper.  The right of King William to the\r\nThrone was an article of faith with him, and it came on him one day\r\nwith the shock of a terrible surprise that his wife did not altogether\r\nshare his conviction.  He vowed that he would never live with her again\r\nunless or until she became of his way of thinking; and he straightway\r\nleft the house, nor did he return to his home and his wife until after\r\nthe death of the King, when the controversy might be considered as\r\nhaving closed.  The King died so soon, however, that the pair were only\r\nseparated for about a year; but it may fairly be assumed that, had the\r\nKing lived twenty years, Wesley would not have returned to his wife\r\nunless she had signified to him that she had renounced her pestilent\r\nscepticism.\r\n\r\nThe same stern strength of resolve which Wesley, the father, showed in\r\nthis extraordinary course was shown by the son at many a grave public\r\ncrisis in his career.  The birth of John Wesley was the result of the\r\nreconciliation between the elder Wesley and his wife.  There were other\r\nchildren, elder and younger; one of whom, Charles, became in after-life\r\nthe faithful companion and colleague of his brother.  John and Charles\r\nWesley were educated at Oxford, and were distinguished there by the\r\nfervor of their religious zeal and the austerity of their lives.  There\r\nwere other young men there at the time who grew into close affinity\r\nwith the Wesleys.  There was George Whitefield, the son of a Gloucester\r\ninnkeeper, who at one time was employed as a drawer in his mother's\r\ntap-room; and there was James Hervey, afterwards author of the flowery\r\nand sentimental \"Meditations,\" that became for a while so famous--a\r\nbook which Southey describes \"as laudable in purpose and vicious in\r\nstyle.\"  These young men, with others, formed a sort of little\r\nreligious association or companionship of their own.  They used to hold\r\nmeetings for their mutual instruction and improvement in religious\r\nfaith and life.  They shunned all amusement and all ordinary social\r\nintercourse.  They were ridiculed {129} and laughed at, and various\r\nnicknames were bestowed on them.  One of these nicknames they accepted\r\nand adopted; as the Flemish _Gueux_ had done, and many another\r\nreligious sect and political party as well.  Those who chose to laugh\r\nat them saw especial absurdity in their formal and methodical way of\r\nmanaging their spiritual exercises and their daily lives.  The jesters\r\ndubbed them Methodists; Wesley and his friends welcomed the title; and\r\nthe fame of the Methodists now folds in the orb of the earth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1738--Torpor of the English Church]\r\n\r\nWesley and his friends had in the beginning, and for long years after,\r\nno idea whatever of leaving the fold of the English Church.  They had\r\nas little thought of that kind as in a later generation had the men who\r\nmade the Free Church of Scotland.  Probably their ideas were very vague\r\nin their earlier years.  They were young men tremendously in earnest;\r\nthey were aflame in spirit and conscience with religious zeal; and they\r\nsaw that the Church of England was not doing the work that might have\r\nbeen and ought to have been expected of her.  She had ceased utterly to\r\nbe a missionary Church.  She troubled herself in nowise about spreading\r\nthe glad tidings of salvation among the heathen.  At home she was\r\nabsolutely out of touch with the great bulk of the people.  The poor\r\nand the ignorant were left quietly to their own resources.  The\r\nclergymen of the Church of England were not indeed by any means a body\r\nof men wanting in personal morality, or even in religious feeling, but\r\nthey had as little or no religious activity because they had little or\r\nno religious zeal.  They performed perfunctorily their perfunctory\r\nduties; and that, as a rule, was all they did.\r\n\r\nAtterbury, Burnet, Swift, all manner of writers, who were themselves\r\nministering in the Church of England, unite in bearing testimony to the\r\ntorpid condition into which the Church had fallen.  Decorum seemed to\r\nbe the highest reach of the spiritual lives of most of the clergy.  One\r\nfinds curious confirmation of the statements {130} made publicly by men\r\nlike Atterbury and Burnet in some of the appeals privately made by\r\nSwift to his powerful friends for the promotion of poor and deserving\r\nclergymen whose poverty and merit had been brought under his notice.\r\nThe recommendation generally begins and ends in the fact that each\r\nparticular man had led a decent, respectable life; that he was striving\r\nto bring up honestly a large family; and that his living or curacy was\r\nnot enough to maintain him in comfort.  We hardly ever hear of the work\r\nwhich the good man had been doing among the poor, the ignorant, and the\r\nsinful.  Swift has said many hard and even terrible things about\r\nbishops and deans, and vicars and curates.  But these stern accusations\r\ndo not form anything like as formidable a testimony against the\r\ncondition into which the Church had fallen as will be found in the\r\nexceptional praise which he gives to those whom he specially desires to\r\nrecommend for promotion; and in the fact that the highest reach of that\r\npraise comes to nothing more than the assurance that the man had led a\r\ndecent life, had a large family, and was very poor.  Such a\r\nrecommendation as that would not have counted for much with John\r\nWesley.  He would have wanted to know what work the clergyman had done\r\noutside his own domestic life; what ignorance had he enlightened, what\r\nsinners had he brought to repentance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1738--An \"archbishop of the slums\"]\r\n\r\nThings were still worse in the Established Church of Ireland.  Hardly a\r\npastor of that Church could speak three words of the language of the\r\nIrish people.  Lord Stanhope, in his \"History of England from the Peace\r\nof Utrecht,\" writes as if the Irish clergymen--the clergymen, that is,\r\nof the Established Church of Ireland--might have accomplished wonders\r\nin the way of converting the Irish peasantry to Protestantism if they\r\nonly could have preached and controverted in the Irish language.  We\r\nare convinced that they could have done nothing of the kind.  The Irish\r\nCeltic population is in its very nature a Catholic population.  Not all\r\nthe preaching since Adam {131} could have made them other than that.\r\nStill it struck John Wesley very painfully later on that the effort was\r\nnever made, and that the men who could not talk to the Irish people in\r\ntheir own tongue, and who did not take the trouble to learn the\r\nlanguage, were not in a promising condition for the conversion of\r\nsouls.  The desire of Wesley and his brother, and Whitefield and the\r\nrest, seems only at first to have been an awakening of the Church in\r\nthese islands to a sense of her duty.  They do not appear to have had\r\nany very far-reaching hopes or plans.  They saw that the work was left\r\nundone, and they labored to bring about a spirit which should lead men\r\nto the doing of it.  At first they only held their little meetings on\r\neach succeeding Sunday; but they found themselves warming to the task,\r\nand they began to meet and confer very often.  Their one thought was\r\nhow to get at the people; how to get at the lowly, the ignorant, and\r\nthe poor.  Soon they began to see that the lowly, the ignorant, and the\r\npoor would not come to the Church, and that, therefore, the Church must\r\ngo out to them.  In a day much nearer to our own a prelate of the\r\nEstablished Church indulged in a very unlucky and unworthy sneer at the\r\nexpense of the first Roman Catholic Archbishop of Westminster.  He\r\ncalled him an \"Archbishop of the slums.\"  The retort was easy and\r\nconclusive.  It was an admission.  \"Exactly; that is just what I am.  I\r\nam an archbishop of the slums; that is my business; that is what I\r\ndesire to be.  My ministry is among the hovels and the garrets and the\r\nslums; yours, I admit, is something very different.\"\r\n\r\nThis illustrates to the life the central idea which was forming itself\r\ngradually and slowly into shape in the mind of John Wesley and in the\r\nminds of his associates.  They saw that archbishops of the slums were\r\nthe very prelates whom England needed.  Their souls revolted against\r\nthe apparently accepted idea that the duties of a priest of the Church\r\nof England were fulfilled by the preaching of a chill, formal, written\r\nsermon once a week, and the attendance {132} on Court ceremonials, and\r\nthe dining at the houses of those who would then have been called \"the\r\ngreat.\"  An institution which could do no more and strove to do no more\r\nthan the Church of England was then doing did not seem to them to\r\ndeserve the name of a Church.  It was simply a branch of the Civil\r\nService of the State.  But Wesley and his brother, and Whitefield and\r\nthe rest, fully believed at first that they could do something to\r\nquicken the Church into a real, a beneficent, and a religions activity.\r\nMost of them had for a long time a positive horror of open-air\r\npreaching and of the co-operation of lay preachers.  Most of them for a\r\nlong time clung to all the traditional forms and even formulas amid\r\nwhich they had grown up.  What Wesley and the others did not see at\r\nfirst, or for long after, was that the Church of England was not then\r\nequal to the work which ought to have been hers.  A great change was\r\ncoming over the communities and the population of England.  Small\r\nhamlets were turning into large towns.  Great new manufacturing\r\nindustries were creating new classes of working-men.  Coal-mines were\r\ngathering together vast encampments of people where a little time\r\nbefore there had been idle heath or lonely hill-side.  The Church of\r\nEngland, with her then hide-bound constitution and her traditional\r\nways, was not equal to the new burdens which she was supposed to\r\nundertake.  She suffered also from that lack of competition which is\r\nhurtful to so many institutions.  The Church of Rome had been\r\nsuppressed for the time in this country, and the most urgent means had\r\nbeen employed to keep the Dissenters down; therefore the Church of\r\nEngland had grown contented, sleek, inert, and was no longer equal to\r\nits work.  This fact began after a while to impress itself more and\r\nmore on the minds of the little band who worked with John Wesley.  They\r\nresisted the idea to the very last; they hoped and believed and dreamed\r\nthat they might still be part of the Church of England.  They found\r\nthemselves drawn outside the Church, and they found, too, that when\r\nonce they had gone even a very little way out of the {133} fold, the\r\ngates were rudely closed against them, and they might not return.  It\r\nwas not that Wesley and his associates left the Church of England.  The\r\nChurch would not have them because they would persist in doing the work\r\nto which she would not even attempt to put a hand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1738--John Wesley's Charity]\r\n\r\nJohn Wesley had been profoundly impressed by William Law's pious and\r\nmystical book, \"A Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life,\" which was\r\npublished in 1729.  Law lived in London, and Wesley, who desired to be\r\nin frequent intercourse with him, used to walk to and from the\r\nmetropolis for the purpose.  The money he thus saved he gave to the\r\npoor.  He wore his hair at one time very long in order to save the\r\nexpense of cutting and dressing it, and thus have more money to give\r\naway in charity.  He and his little band of associates, whose numbers\r\nswelled at one time up to twenty-five, but afterwards dropped down to\r\nfive, imposed on themselves rules of discipline almost as harsh as\r\nthose of a monastery of the Trappist order.  They fasted every\r\nWednesday and Friday, and they made it a duty to visit the prisons and\r\nhospitals.  Wesley's father, who was growing old, was very anxious that\r\nhis son should succeed him in the rectory of Epworth.  John would not\r\nhear of it.  In vain his father pressed and prayed; the son could not\r\nsee his way in that direction.  John Wesley has been blamed by some of\r\nhis biographers for not accepting the task which his father desired and\r\nthought right to impose on him.  But no one on earth could understand\r\nJohn Wesley's mission but John Wesley himself.  When it was pressed\r\nupon him that in the living of Epworth he would have the charge of two\r\nthousand souls he said, \"I see not how any man can take care of a\r\nhundred.\"  It was pointed out to him that his little band of companions\r\nhad been growing smaller and smaller; he only answered that he was\r\npurifying a fountain and not a stream.  The illustration was effective\r\nand happy.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that the tremendous energies of John {134} Wesley could\r\nnot possibly find employment within the narrow field of work adopted by\r\nthe Established Church of his day.  Wesley was a fighter; he had to go\r\nout into the broad living world and do battle there.  He had\r\noriginality as well as energy; he must do his work his own way; he\r\ncould not be a minister of routine.  He soon found it borne in upon him\r\nthat he must speak to his fellow-man wherever he could find him.  For a\r\nlong time he held back from the thought of open-air preaching, but now\r\nhe saw that it must be done.  There was a period of his life, he says,\r\nwhen he would have thought the saving of a soul \"a sin almost if it had\r\nnot been done in a church.\"  But from the first moment when he began to\r\npreach to crowds in the open air he must have felt that he had found\r\nhis work at last.  His friend and colleague Whitefield, who had more of\r\nthe genius of an orator than Wesley, had preceded him in this path.\r\nOne is a little surprised that such men as Wesley and Whitefield should\r\never have found any difficulty about preaching to a crowd in the open\r\nair.  The Hill of Mars at Athens listened to an open-air sermon from an\r\napostle, and Whitefield himself observed at a later date that the\r\n\"Sermon on the Mount is a pretty remarkable precedent of field\r\npreaching.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1738--Wesley's superstition]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, Wesley's father died, and Wesley received an\r\ninvitation to go out to Georgia with General Oglethorpe, the governor\r\nof that settlement, to preach to the Indians and the colonists.  He\r\nsailed for the new colony on October 14, 1735.  He was accompanied by\r\nhis brother Charles and two other missionaries, and on board the vessel\r\nwas a small band of men from \"the meek Moravian Missions.\"  The\r\nMoravian sect was then in its earliest working order.  It had been\r\nfounded--or perhaps it would be more fitting to say restored--not many\r\nyears before, by the enthusiastic and devoted Count Von Zinzendorf.\r\nWesley was greatly attracted by the ways and the spiritual life of the\r\nMoravians.  It is worthy of note that when Count Zinzendorf began the\r\nformation or {135} restoration of Moravianism he had as little idea of\r\ndeparting from the fold of the Confession of Augsburg as Wesley had of\r\nleaving the Church of England.  John Wesley did not, as we have said,\r\naccomplish much among the colonists and the Indians.  Perhaps his ways\r\nwere too dogmatic and dictatorial for the colonists.  He departed\r\naltogether from the Church discipline in some of his religious\r\nexercises, while he clung to it pertinaciously in others.  He offended\r\nlocal magnates by preaching at them from the pulpit, giving them pretty\r\nfreely a piece of his mind as to their conduct and ways of life, and,\r\nindeed, turning them to public ridicule with rough and rasping\r\nsarcasms.  With the Indians he could not do much, if only for the fact\r\nthat he had to speak to them through an interpreter.  The tongue, says\r\nJean Paul Richter, is eloquent only in its own language, and the heart\r\nin its own religion.  It certainly was not from lack of zeal and energy\r\nthat Wesley failed to accomplish much among the Indians.  He flung\r\nhimself into the work with all his indomitable spirit and disregard for\r\ntrouble and pain.  One of his biographers tells us that \"he exposed\r\nhimself with the utmost indifference to every change of season and\r\ninclemency of weather; snow and hail, storm and tempest, had no effect\r\non his iron body.  He frequently lay down on the ground and slept all\r\nnight with his hair frozen to the earth; he would swim over rivers with\r\nhis clothes on and travel till they were dry, and all this without any\r\napparent injury to his health.\"  It is no wonder that Wesley soon began\r\nto regard himself as a man specially protected by divine power.  He was\r\ndeeply, romantically superstitious.  He commonly guided his course by\r\nopening a page of the Bible and reading the first passage that met his\r\neye.  He saw visions; he believed in omens.  He tells us himself of the\r\ninstantaneous way in which some of his prayers for rescue from danger\r\nwere answered from above.  Those who believe that the work Wesley had\r\nto do was really great and beneficent work will hardly feel any regret\r\nthat such a man should have allowed himself to be governed {136} by\r\nsuch ideas.  It was necessary to the tasks he had to execute that he\r\nshould believe himself to bear a charmed life.\r\n\r\nWesley was very near getting married in Georgia.  A clever and pretty\r\nyoung woman in Savannah set herself at him.  She consulted him about\r\nher spiritual salvation, she dressed always in white because she\r\nunderstood that he liked such simplicity of color, she nursed him when\r\nhe was ill.  The governor of the colony favored the young lady's\r\nintentions, which were indeed strictly honorable, being most distinctly\r\nmatrimonial.  At one time it seemed very likely that the marriage would\r\ntake place, but Wesley's heart was evidently not in the affair.  Some\r\nof his colleagues told him plainly enough that they believed the young\r\nlady to be merely playing a game, that she put on affection and\r\ndevotion only that she might put on a wedding-dress.  Wesley consulted\r\nsome of the elders of the Moravian Church, and promised to abide by\r\ntheir decision.  Their advice was that he should go no further with the\r\nyoung woman, and Wesley kept his word and refused to see her any more.\r\nShe married, soon after, the chief magistrate of the colony, and before\r\nlong we find Wesley publicly reprehending her for \"something in her\r\nbehavior of which he disapproved,\" and threatening even to exclude her\r\nfrom the communion of the Church until she should have signified her\r\nsincere repentance.  Her family took legal proceedings against him.\r\nWesley did not care; he was about to return to England, and he was\r\ncalled on to give bail for his reappearance in the colony.  He\r\ncontemptuously refused to do anything of the kind, and promptly sailed\r\nfrom Savannah.\r\n\r\nThis little episode of the Georgian girl is characteristic of the man.\r\nHe did not care about marrying her, but it did not seem to him a matter\r\nof much importance either way, and he doubtless would have married her\r\nbut that he thought it well to seek the advice of his Moravian friends,\r\nand bound himself to abide by their decision.  That decision once\r\ngiven, he had no further wavering or {137} doubt, but the course he had\r\ntaken and the manner in which he had completely thrown over the woman\r\ndid not prevent him in the least from visiting her with a public rebuke\r\nwhen he saw something in her conduct of which he disapproved.  He saw\r\nno reason why, because he refused to be her lover, he should fail in\r\nhis duty as her minister.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1738--Wesley's unhappy marriage]\r\n\r\nWe may anticipate a little as to Wesley's personal history.  Later in\r\nhis life he married.  He was not happy in his marriage.  He took for\r\nhis wife a widow who plagued him by her narrow-mindedness, her\r\nbitterness, and her jealousy.  Wesley's care and kindness of the women\r\nwho came under his ministrations set his wife wild with suspicion and\r\nanger.  She could not believe that a man could be kind to a woman, even\r\nas a pastor, without having evil purpose in his heart.  She had the\r\ntemper of a virago; she stormed against her husband, she threatened\r\nhim, she sometimes rushed at him and tore his hair; she repeatedly left\r\nhis house, but was prevailed upon by him to return.  At last after a\r\nfierce quarrel she flung out of the house, vowing that she would never\r\ncome back.  Wesley's comment, which he expressed in Latin, was stern\r\nand characteristic: \"I have not left her, I have not put her away, I\r\nwill never recall her.\"  He kept his word.\r\n\r\nWesley started on his mission to preach to the people and to pray with\r\nthem.  Whitefield and Charles Wesley did the same.  Charles Wesley was\r\nthe hymn writer, the sweet singer, of the movement.  The meetings began\r\nto grow larger, more enthusiastic, more impassioned, every day.  John\r\nWesley brought to his work \"a frame of adamant\" as well as \"a soul of\r\nfire.\"  No danger frighted him, and no labor tired.  Rain, hail, snow,\r\nstorm, were matters of indifference to him when he had any work to do.\r\nOne reads the account of the toil he could cheerfully bear, the\r\nprivations he could recklessly undergo, the physical obstacles he could\r\nsurmount, with what would be a feeling of incredulity were it possible\r\nto doubt the unquestionable evidence of a whole cloud of {138}\r\nheterogeneous witnesses.  Not Mark Antony, not Charles the Twelfth, not\r\nNapoleon, ever went through such physical suffering for the love of\r\nwar, or for the conqueror's ambition, as Wesley was accustomed to\r\nundergo for the sake of preaching at the right time and in the right\r\nplace to some crowd of ignorant and obscure men, the conversion of whom\r\ncould bring him neither fame nor fortune.\r\n\r\nAll the phenomena with which we have been familiar in modern times of\r\nwhat are called \"revivalist\" meetings were common among the\r\ncongregations to whom Wesley preached.  Women especially were affected\r\nin this way.  They raved, shrieked, struggled, flung themselves on the\r\nground, fainted, cried out that they were possessed by evil spirits.\r\nWesley rather encouraged these manifestations, and indeed quite\r\nbelieved in their genuineness.  No doubt for the most part they were\r\ngenuine: that is, they were the birth of hysterical, highly strung\r\nnatures, stimulated into something like epilepsy or temporary insanity\r\nby the unbearable oppression of a wholly novel excitement.  No such\r\nevidences of emotion were ever given in the parish church where the\r\nworthy clergyman read his duly prepared or perhaps thoughtfully\r\npurchased sermon.  Sometimes a new form of hysteria possessed some of\r\nWesley's congregations, and irrepressible peals of laughter broke from\r\nsome of the brethren and sisters, who declared that they were forced to\r\nit by Satan.  Wesley quite accepted this explanation, and so did most\r\nof his companions.  Two ladies, however, refused to believe, and\r\ninsisted that \"any one might help laughing if she would.\"  But very\r\nsoon after these two sceptics were seized with the very same sort of\r\nirrepressible laughter.  They continued for two days laughing almost\r\nwithout cessation, \"a spectacle to all,\" as Wesley tells, \"and were\r\nthen upon prayer made for them delivered in a moment.\"  It is almost\r\nneedless now to say that bursts of irrepressible laughter are among the\r\ncommonest forms of hysterical excitement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1738--Whitefield's oratory]\r\n\r\nThe cooler common-sense of Charles Wesley, however, {139} saw these\r\nmanifestations with different eyes.  He felt sure that there was\r\nsometimes a good deal of affectation in them, and he publicly\r\nremonstrated with some women who, as it appeared to him, were\r\nneedlessly making themselves ridiculous.  He was probably right in\r\nthese instances: the instinct of imitation is so strong among men and\r\nwomen that every genuine outburst of maniacal excitement is sure to be\r\nfollowed by some purely mimetic efforts of a similar demonstration.\r\nThe novelty of the whole movement was enough to account for the genuine\r\nand the sham hysterics.  It was an entirely new experience then for\r\nEnglish men and women of the humblest class, and of that generation, to\r\nbe addressed in great open-air masses by renowned and powerful\r\npreachers.  Whitefield's first great effort at field-preaching was made\r\nfor the benefit of the colliers at Kingswood, near Bristol.  Before\r\nmany weeks had gone by, he could gather round him some twenty thousand\r\nof these men.  Whitefield had a marvellous fervor and force of oratory.\r\nHis voice, his gestures, his sudden and startling appeals, his solemn\r\npauses, the dramatic and even theatric energy which he threw into his\r\nattitudes and his action, his flights of lofty and sustained\r\ndeclamation, contrasting with sentences of homely colloquialism, were\r\noverwhelming in their effect on such an audience.  \"The first\r\ndiscovery,\" he says himself, \"of their being affected was to see the\r\nwhite gutters made by their tears, which plentifully fell down their\r\ncheeks, black as they came out of the coal-pits.\"  It was not only\r\nminers and other illiterate men whom Whitefield impressed by the fervor\r\nand passion of his eloquence.  Hume, Benjamin Franklin, Horace Walpole,\r\nand other men as well qualified to judge, and as little likely to fall\r\nunder the spell of religions or sentimental enthusiasm, have borne\r\nwilling testimony to the irresistible power of a sermon from Whitefield.\r\n\r\nWesley and Whitefield did not remain long in spiritual companionship.\r\nThey could not agree as to the Calvinistic doctrine of predestination.\r\nWesley was opposed to {140} the doctrine; Whitefield willing to accept\r\nit.  They discussed and discussed the question, but without drawing any\r\nnearer together.  Indeed, as might naturally have been expected, they\r\nonly fell more widely asunder, and after a while the difference of\r\nopinion grew to something like a personal estrangement.  Wesley had\r\nalready broken away from spiritual communion with some of his old\r\nfriends, the Moravians.  Probably he felt all the stronger for his own\r\nwork now that he stood as a leader all but alone.  He walked his own\r\nwild road; Whitefield took a path for himself.  Wesley soon found that\r\nhe was gaining more followers than he had lost.  He had to adopt the\r\npractice of employing lay preachers; it was a matter of necessity to\r\nhis task.  He could not induce many clergymen to work under his\r\nguidance and after his fashion.  The movement was spreading all over\r\nthe country.  Wesley became the centre and light of his wing of the\r\ncampaign.  The machinery of his organization was simple and strong.  A\r\nconference was called together every year, which was composed of\r\npreachers selected by Wesley.  These formed his cabinet or central\r\nboard, and lent their authority to his decisions.\r\n\r\nThis was the germ of the great Wesleyan organization, which has since\r\nbecome so powerful, and has spread itself so widely over Great Britain\r\nand the American States.  The preachers were sent by Wesley from one\r\npart of the country to another, just as he thought best; and it never\r\noccurred to any missionary to refuse, remonstrate, or even delay.  The\r\nsystem was admirable; the discipline was perfect.  Wesley was as\r\ncompletely in command of his body of missionaries as the general of the\r\norder of Jesuits is of those over whom he is called to exercise\r\ncontrol.  The humblest of the Wesleyan preachers caught something,\r\ncaught indeed very much, of the energy, the courage, the devotion, the\r\nself-sacrifice, of their great leader.  No doubt there were many errors\r\nand offences here and there.  Good taste, sobriety of judgment,\r\nprudence, common-sense, were now and then offended.  Most of the\r\npreachers were {141} ignorant men, who had nothing but an untaught\r\nenthusiasm and a rude, uncouth eloquence to carry them on.  They had to\r\npreach to multitudes very often more ignorant and uncouth than\r\nthemselves.  It would be absolutely impossible under such conditions\r\nthat there should not sometimes be offence, and, as Hamlet says, \"much\r\noffence too.\"  But there was no greater departure from the lines of\r\npropriety and good taste than any one who took a reasonable view of the\r\nwhole work and its workers must have expected to find.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1738--Opposition to Wesleyanism]\r\n\r\nOf course a strong opposition to the movement showed itself in many\r\nparts of the country.  The Wesleyans were denounced; they were\r\nridiculed; they were caricatured; they were threatened; they were set\r\nupon by ruffians; they were stoned by mobs.  In some places it was said\r\nthat the local magistrates actually connived with the attempt to drive\r\nthem out by force.  Projects are actually declared to have been formed\r\nfor their complete extermination.  Such projects, however, do not\r\nsucceed.  No amount of violence has ever yet exterminated religious\r\nzeal and impassioned, even let it be fanatical, enthusiasm.  John\r\nWesley went his way undismayed.  He even appears to have positively\r\nenjoyed the excitement and the danger.  The persecution began after a\r\nwhile to languish in its efforts, and the Wesleyans kept growing more\r\nand more numerous and strong.  But the movement in growing grew away\r\nfrom the Church of England.  Wesley had been drawn out of his original\r\nintent step after step.  He could not help himself, once his movement\r\nhad been started.  He had had to take to field preaching, for the good\r\nreason that he could not otherwise reach the people whom it was his\r\nheart's warmest longing to reach.  He had to take to employing lay\r\npreachers, because without them he could not have got his preaching\r\ndone.  At last he began to ordain ministers, and even, it is said,\r\nbishops, for the missions in America.  He had, in fact, broken away\r\naltogether from the discipline of the Church of England, although he\r\npersisted to his dying day that he never had any design of {142}\r\nseparating from the Church, \"and had no such design now.\"  Near to the\r\nclose of his long life he declared, \"I live and die a member of the\r\nChurch of England, and none who regard my judgment or advice will ever\r\nseparate from it.\"  No one can doubt that Wesley spoke in full\r\nsincerity.  When he stepped outside the pale of Church practice it was\r\nonly to do what he believed ought to have been the work of the Church\r\nitself, but which the Church did not then care to attempt, and which,\r\nas he felt convinced, could not afford to wait for the indefinite time\r\nwhen the Church might have the spirit, the energy, and the resources\r\nneeded for such an undertaking.\r\n\r\nWesley was a thorough despot; as much of a despot as Peter the Great or\r\nNapoleon.  He took no trouble to disguise his despotic purpose.  He did\r\nnot shelter himself, as Napoleon once wished to do, under the draperies\r\nof a constitutional king.  Wesley was satisfied in his own mind that he\r\nknew better than any other man how to guide his movements and govern\r\nhis followers, and he told people that he knew it, and acted\r\naccordingly.  The members of his conference, or what we have called his\r\ncabinet, were only like Clive's council of war; Wesley listened to\r\ntheir advice and their arguments, but acted according to his own\r\njudgment all the same.  Late in his career it was charged against him\r\nthat he was trying to turn himself into a sort of Methodist pope.  He\r\nasked for some explanation of this, and was told that he had invested\r\nhimself with arbitrary power.  His answer was simple and\r\nstraightforward.  \"If by arbitrary power you mean a power which I\r\nexercise singly, without any colleagues therein, this is certainly\r\ntrue; but I see no hurt in it.\"  All the actions of his life show this\r\ncomplete faith in himself where the business of his mission was\r\nconcerned.  He was dogmatic, masterful, overbearing, very often far\r\nfrom amiable, sometimes all but unendurable, to those around him.  But\r\nif he had not had these peculiar qualities or defects he would not have\r\nbeen the man that he was; he would not have been able to bear the\r\ncharge of such a task at such a {143} time.  It is probable that\r\nHannibal did not cut through the Alps with vinegar; it is certain that\r\nhe could not have pierced his way with honey.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1738--Religion out of fashion]\r\n\r\nNothing can better show than the rise and progress of the great\r\nMethodist movement how vast is the difference between a people and what\r\nis commonly called society.  In society everywhere throughout England,\r\nin the great provincial cities as well as in the capital, religion\r\nseemed to have completely gone out of fashion.  The Court cared nothing\r\nabout it.  The King had no real belief in his heart; he had as little\r\nfaith in Divine guidance as he had in the honor of man or the chastity\r\nof woman.  The Queen's devotional exercises were nothing but a mere\r\nperformance carried on sometimes through a half-opened door, the\r\nattendant minister on one side of the door and the gossiping,\r\nchattering ladies on the other.  The leading statesmen of the age were\r\navowedly indifferent or professedly unbelieving.  Bolingbroke was a\r\npreacher of unbelief.  Walpole never seems to have cared to turn his\r\nthoughts for one moment to anything higher than his own political\r\ncareer, the upholding of his friends if they stood fast by him, and the\r\ndownfall of his enemies.  Chesterfield was not exactly the sort of man\r\nto be stirred into spiritual life.  Morals were getting out of fashion\r\nas much as religion.  Society had all the grossness without much of the\r\nwit which belonged to the days of the Restoration.  Yet the mere fact\r\nthat the Wesleyan movement made such sudden way among the poor and the\r\nlowly shows beyond question that the heart of the English people had\r\nnot been corrupted.  Conscience was asleep, but it was not dead.  The\r\nfirst words of Wesley seemed to quicken it into a new life.\r\n\r\nWe have somewhat anticipated the actual course of events in order to\r\nshow at once what the Wesleyan movement came to.  During the lifetime\r\nof its founder it had grown into a great national and international\r\ninstitution.  Since his time it has been spreading and growing all over\r\nthe world where Christianity grows.  It is the severest in {144} its\r\ndiscipline of all the Protestant churches, and yet it exercises a charm\r\neven over gentle and tender natures, and makes them its willing\r\nservants, while it teaches the wilder and fiercer spirits to bend their\r\nnatures and tame their wild passions down.  [Sidenote: 1738--The\r\nWesleyan work] In the United States of America Wesleyanism is now one\r\nof the most popular and powerful of all the denominations of\r\nChristianity.  It has since been divided up into many sections, both\r\nhere and there, on questions of discipline, and even on questions of\r\nbelief; but in its leading characteristics it has been faithful to the\r\nmain purpose of its founder.  Its success did not consist mainly in\r\nwhat it accomplished for its own people; it achieved a great work also\r\nby the impulse it gave to the Church of England.  That Church for a\r\nwhile seemed to be filled with a reviving spiritual and ministerial\r\nactivity.  It appeared to take shame to itself that it had remained so\r\nlong apathetic and perfunctory, and it flung itself into competition\r\nwith the younger and more energetic mission.  The English Church did\r\nnot indeed retain this mood of ardor and of eagerness very long.  After\r\na time it relapsed into comparative inactivity; and a new and very\r\ndifferent movement was needed at a period much nearer to our own to\r\nmake it once again a ministering power to the people--to the poor.  But\r\nfor the time the revival of the Church was genuine and was beneficent.\r\nWith the quickened religious vitality of the Wesleyan movement came\r\nalso a quickened philanthropic spirit; a zeal for the instruction, the\r\npurification, and the better life of men and women.  The common\r\ninstinct of humanity always is to strive for higher and better ways of\r\nliving, if only once the word of guidance is given and the soul of true\r\nmanhood is roused to the work.  Indeed, there is not much about this\r\nperiod of English history concerning which the modern Englishman can\r\nfeel really proud except that great religious revival which began with\r\nthe thoughts and the teachings of John Wesley.  One turns in relief\r\nfrom the partisan struggles in Parliament and out of it, from the\r\nintrigues and counter-intrigues of selfish and perfidious statesmen,\r\nand {145} the alcove conspiracies of worthless women, to Wesley and his\r\nreligious visions, to Whitefield and his colliers, to Charles Wesley\r\nand his sweet devotional hymns.  Many of us are unable to have any\r\nmanner of sympathy with the precise doctrines and the forms of faith\r\nwhich Wesley taught.  But the man must have no sympathy with faith or\r\nreligious feeling of any kind who does not recognize the unspeakable\r\nvalue of that great reform which Wesley and Whitefield introduced to\r\nthe English people.  They taught moral doctrines which we all accept in\r\ncommon, but they did not teach them after the cold and barren way of\r\nthe plodding, mechanical instructor.  They thundered them into the\r\nopening ears of thousands who had never been roused to moral sentiment\r\nbefore.  They inspired the souls of poor and commonplace creatures with\r\nall the zealot's fire and all the martyr's endurance.  They brought\r\ntears to penitent eyes which had never been moistened before by any but\r\nthe selfish sense of personal pain or grief.  They pierced through the\r\ndull, vulgar, contaminated hideousness of low and vicious life, and\r\nsent streaming in upon it the light of a higher world and a better law.\r\nEvery new Wesleyan became a missionary of Wesleyanism.  The son\r\nconverted the father, the daughter won over the heart of the mother.\r\nThere was much that was hard, much that was fierce, in the doctrine and\r\nthe discipline of Methodism, but that time was not one in which gentler\r\nteachings could much prevail.  Men and women had to be startled into a\r\nsense of the need of their spiritual regeneration.  Wesley and the\r\ncomrades who worked with him in the beginning, and with some of whom,\r\nlike Whitefield, he ceased after a while to work, were just the men\r\nneeded to call aloud to the people and make sure that their voices must\r\nbe heard.  They had to talk in a shout if they were to talk to any\r\npurpose.  There was much in their style of eloquence against which a\r\npure and cultured criticism would naturally protest.  But they did not\r\nspeak for the pure and cultured criticism.  They came to call ignorant\r\nsinners to repentance.  They have the one great abiding {146} merit,\r\nthey have the one enduring fame--that they saw their real business in\r\nlife; that they kept to it through whatever disadvantage, pain, and\r\ndanger; and that they accomplished what they had gone out to do.  Their\r\nmonument lives to-day in the living history of England and of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{147}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nENGLAND'S HONOR AND JENKINS'S EAR.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1738--The passion of war]\r\n\r\n\"Madam, there are fifty thousand men slain this year in Europe, and not\r\none Englishman among them.\"  This was the proud boast which, as has\r\nbeen already mentioned, Walpole was able to make to Queen Caroline not\r\nvery long before her death, when she was trying to stir him up to a\r\nmore agressive policy in the affairs of the Continent.  Walpole's words\r\nsound almost like an anticipation of Prince Bismarck's famous\r\ndeclaration that the Eastern Question was not worth to Germany the life\r\nof a single Pomeranian grenadier.  But Prince Bismarck was more\r\nfortunate than Walpole in his policy of peace.  He had secured a\r\nposition of advantage for himself in maintaining that policy which\r\nWalpole never had.  Prince Bismarck had twice over made it clear to all\r\nthe world that he could conduct to the most complete success a policy\r\nof uncompromising war.  Walpole had all the difficulty in keeping to\r\nhis policy of peace which a statesman always has who is suspected,\r\nrightly or wrongly, of a willingness to purchase peace at almost any\r\nprice.  It is melancholy to have to make the statement, but the\r\nstatement is nevertheless true, that in the England of Walpole's day,\r\nand in the England of our own day as well, the statesman who is known\r\nto love peace is sure to have it shrieked at him in some crisis that he\r\ndoes not love the honor of his country.  A periodical outbreak of the\r\ncraving or lust for war seems to be one of the passions and one of the\r\nafflictions of almost every great commonwealth in Europe.  A wise and\r\njust policy may have secured a peace that has lasted for years; but the\r\nmere fact that peace has lasted for years {148} seems to many\r\nunthinking people reason enough why the country should be favored with\r\na taste of war.  We are constantly declaring that England is not a\r\nmilitary nation, and yet no statesman is ever so popular for the hour\r\nin England as the statesman who fires the people with the passion of\r\nwar.  Many a minister, weak and unpopular in his domestic policy, has\r\nsuddenly made himself the hero and the darling of the moment by\r\ndeclaring that some foreign state has insulted England, and that the\r\ntime has come when the sword must be drawn to defend the nation's\r\nhonor.  Then \"away to heaven, respective lenity\" indeed!  The appeal\r\nacts like a charm to call out the passion and to silence the reason of\r\nvast masses of the population in all ranks and conditions.  Even among\r\nthe working-classes and the poor--who, one might imagine, have all to\r\nlose and nothing to gain by war--it is by no means certain that the war\r\nfever will not flame for the hour.  There are seasons when, as Burke\r\nhas said, \"even the humblest of us are degraded into the vices and\r\nfollies of kings.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1738--The patriots' war-cry]\r\n\r\nWar had no fascination for Walpole.  He saw it only in its desolation,\r\nits cruelty, its folly, and its cost.  At the time which we have now\r\nreached he looked with clear gaze over the European continent, and he\r\nsaw nothing in the action of foreign Powers which concerned the honor\r\nand the interest of England enough to make it necessary for her to draw\r\nthe sword.  But, unfortunately for his country and for his fame,\r\nWalpole was not a statesman of firm and lofty principle.  He was always\r\nwilling to come to terms.  In the domestic affairs of England he\r\nallowed grievances to exist which he had again and again condemned and\r\ndeplored, and which every one knew he was sincerely desirous to remove;\r\nhe allowed them to exist because it might have been a source of\r\nannoyance to the King if the minister had troubled him about such a\r\nsubject.  He acted on this policy with regard to the grievances of\r\nwhich the Dissenters complained, and, as he always admitted, very\r\njustly complained.  Much as he detested a policy of war, he was not the\r\nminister who would {149} stand by a policy of peace at the risk of\r\nlosing his popularity and his power.  Much as he loved peace, he loved\r\nhis place as Prime Minister still more.  It is probable that his\r\nenemies gave him credit for greater fixity of purpose in regard to his\r\npeace policy than he really possessed.  They believed, perhaps, that\r\nthey had only to get up a good, popular war-cry in England, and that\r\nWalpole would have to go out of office.  They told themselves that he\r\nwould not make war.  On this faith they based their schemes and founded\r\ntheir hopes.  It would have been well for Walpole and for England if\r\ntheir belief had been justified by events.\r\n\r\nThe Patriots raised their war-cry.  The honor of England had been\r\ninsulted.  Her claims had been rejected with insolent scorn.  Her flag\r\nhad been trampled on; her seamen had been imprisoned, mutilated,\r\ntortured; and all this by whom?  By whom, indeed, but the old and\r\nimplacable enemy of England, the Power which had sent the Armada to\r\ninvade England's shores and to set up the Inquisition among the English\r\npeople--by Spain, of course, by Spain!  In Spanish dungeons brave\r\nEnglishmen were wearing out their lives.  In mid-ocean English ships\r\nwere stopped and searched by arrogant officers of the King of Spain.\r\nWhy did Spain venture on such acts?  Because, the Patriots cried out,\r\nSpain believed that England's day of strength had gone, and that\r\nEngland could now be insulted with impunity.  What wonder, they asked,\r\nin patriotic passion, if Spain or any other foreign state should\r\nbelieve such things?  Was there not a Minister now at the head of\r\naffairs in England, now grasping all the various powers of the state in\r\nhis own hands, who was notoriously willing to put up with any insult,\r\nto subject his country to any degradation, rather than venture on even\r\na remonstrance that might lead to war?  Let the flag of England be torn\r\ndown and trailed in the dust--what then?  What cared the Minister whose\r\nonly fear was, not of dishonor, but of danger.\r\n\r\nThis was the fiery stuff which the Patriots kept {150} flooding the\r\ncountry with; which they poured out in speeches and pamphlets, and\r\npasquinades and lampoons.  Some of them probably came in the end to\r\nbelieve it all themselves.  Walpole was assailed every hour--he was\r\nheld up to public hatred and scorn as if he had betrayed his country.\r\nBolingbroke from his exile contributed his share to the literature of\r\nblood, and soon came over from his exile to take a larger share in it.\r\nThe _Craftsman_ ran over with furious diatribes against the Minister of\r\nPeace.  Caricatures of all kinds represented Walpole abasing himself\r\nbefore Spain and entering into secret engagements with her, to the\r\nprejudice and detriment of England.  Ballads were hawked and sung\r\nthrough the streets which described Walpole as acknowledging to the\r\nSpanish Don that he hated the English merchants and traders just as\r\nmuch as the Don did, and that he was heartily glad when Spain applied\r\nher rod to them.  The country became roused to the wildest passion; the\r\nPatriots were carrying it all their own way.\r\n\r\nWhat was it all about?  What was Spain doing?  What ought England to do?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1738--The treaties with Spain]\r\n\r\nThe whole excitement arose out of certain long-standing trade disputes\r\nbetween England and Spain in the New World.  These disputes had been\r\nreferred to in the Treaty of Utrecht, which was supposed to have\r\nsettled them in 1713; and again in the Treaty of Seville, which was\r\nbelieved to have finally settled them in 1729.  England had recognized\r\nthe right of Spain to regulate the trade with Spanish colonies.  Spain\r\nagreed that England should have the privilege of supplying the Spanish\r\ncolonies with slaves.  This noble privilege English traders exercised\r\nto the full.  It is not very gratifying to have to recollect that two\r\nof England's great disputes with Spain were about England's claim to an\r\nunlimited right to sell slaves to the Spanish colonies.  To England, or\r\nat least to the English South Sea Company, was also conceded the\r\npermission to send one merchant vessel each year to the South Seas with\r\nas much English goods to sell to the Spanish colonies as a {151} ship\r\nof 500 tons could carry.  As everybody might have expected, the\r\nprovisions of the treaty were constantly broken through.  The English\r\ntraders were very eager to sell their goods; the Spanish colonists were\r\nvery glad to get them to buy.  All other commerce than that in slaves\r\nand the one annual shipload of English goods was strictly prohibited by\r\nSpain.  The whole arrangement now seems in the highest degree\r\nartificial and absurd; but it was not an uncommon sort of international\r\narrangement then.  As was to be expected, the English traders set going\r\na huge illicit trade in the South Seas.  This was done partly by the\r\nold familiar smuggling process, and partly, too, by keeping little\r\nfleets of smaller vessels swarming off the coasts and reloading the one\r\nlegitimate vessel as often as her contents were sent into a port.  This\r\ningenious device was said to have been detected by the Spanish\r\nauthorities in various places.  The Spaniards retaliated by stopping\r\nand searching English vessels cruising anywhere near the coast of a\r\nSpanish colony, and by arresting and imprisoning the officers and\r\nsailors of English merchantmen.  The Spaniards asserted, and were able\r\nin many instances to make their assertions good, that whole squadrons\r\nof English trading vessels sometimes entered the Spanish ports under\r\npretence of being driven there by stress of weather, or by the need of\r\nrefitting and refreshing; and that, once in the port, they managed to\r\nget their cargoes safely ashore.  Sometimes, too, it was said, the\r\nvessels lay off the shore without going into the harbor; and then\r\nsmugglers came off in their long, low, swift boats, and received the\r\nEnglish goods and carried them into the port.  The fact undoubtedly was\r\nthat the English merchants were driving a roaring trade with the\r\nSpanish colonies; just as the Spanish authorities might very well have\r\nknown that they would be certain to do.  Where one set of men are\r\nanxious to sell, and another set are just as anxious to buy, it needs\r\nvery rigorous coastguard watching to prevent the goods being sent in\r\nand the money taken away.\r\n\r\nThis fact, however, does not say anything against the {152} right of\r\nSpain to enforce, if she could, the conditions of the treaties.  On\r\nthat point Spain was only asserting her indisputable right.  But would\r\nit be reasonable to expect that Spain or any other country could\r\nendeavor to maintain her right in such a dispute, and under such\r\nconditions, without occasional rashness, violence, and injustice on the\r\npart of her officials?  There can be no doubt that many high-handed and\r\narbitrary acts were done against English subjects by the officers of\r\nSpanish authority.  On every real and every reported and every\r\nimaginary act of Spanish harshness the Patriots seized with avidity.\r\nThey presented petitions, moved for papers, moved that this injured\r\nperson and that be allowed to appear and state his case at the bar of\r\nthe House of Commons.  Some English sailors and other Englishmen were\r\nthus allowed to appear at the bar, and did make statements of outrage\r\nand imprisonment.  Some of these statements were doubtless true, some\r\nwere probably exaggerated; the men who made them were not on oath;\r\nthere was every temptation to exaggerate, because it had become\r\napparently the duty of every true Patriot who loved old England to\r\nbelieve anything said by anybody against Spain.  The same sort of thing\r\nhas happened again and again in times nearer to our own, where some\r\nclass of English traders have been trying to carry on a forbidden\r\ntraffic with the subjects of a foreign sovereign.  We see the same\r\nthings, now in China, and now in Burmah; dress goods in one place,\r\nopium in another, slaves in another; reckless smuggling by the traders,\r\noverdone reprisals by the authorities; and then we hear the familiar\r\nappeal to England not to allow her sons to be insulted and imprisoned\r\nby some insolent foreign Power.\r\n\r\nWalpole was not inclined to allow English subjects to be molested with\r\nimpunity.  But he saw no reason to believe that Spain intended anything\r\nof the kind.  The advices he received from the British Minister at the\r\nSpanish Court spoke rather of delays and slow formalities, and various\r\nsmall disputes and misunderstandings, than of {153} wilful denial of\r\njustice.  Walpole felt satisfied that by putting a little diplomatic\r\npressure on the proceedings every satisfaction fairly due to England\r\nand English subjects could be obtained.  He, therefore, refused for a\r\nlong time to allow his hand to be forced by the Opposition, and was\r\nfull of hope that the good sense of the country in general would\r\nsustain him against the united strength of his enemies, as it had so\r\noften done before.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1738--Alderman Perry's motion]\r\n\r\nWalpole did not know how strong his enemies were this time.  He did not\r\nknow what a capital cry they had got, what a powerful appeal to\r\nnational passion they could put into voice, and what a loud reply the\r\nnational passion would make to the appeal.  On Saturday, March 2, 1738,\r\na petition was presented to the House of Commons from divers merchants,\r\nplanters, and others trading to and interested in the British\r\nplantations in America.  The petition was presented by Mr. Perry, one\r\nof the representatives of London, and an alderman of the City.  The\r\npetition set forth a long history of the alleged grievances, and of the\r\ndenial of redress, and prayed the House to \"provide such timely and\r\nadequate remedy for putting an end to all insults and depredations on\r\nthem and their fellow-subjects as to the House shall seem meet, as well\r\nas procure such relief for the unhappy sufferers as the nature of the\r\ncase and the justice of their cause may require; and that they may be\r\nheard by themselves and counsel thereupon.\"\r\n\r\nOn the same day several other petitions from cities, and from private\r\nindividuals, were presented on the same subject.  The debate on Mr.\r\nPerry's motion mainly turned, at first, on the minor question, whether\r\nthe house would admit the petitioners to be heard by themselves and\r\nalso by counsel, or, according to the habit of the House, by themselves\r\nor counsel.  Yet, short and almost formal as the debate might have\r\nbeen, the opponents of the Government contrived to import into it a\r\nnumber of assumptions, and an amount of passion, such as the earlier\r\nstages of a difficult and delicate international dispute are seldom\r\nallowed to exhibit.  Even so cautious and respectable a man as Sir\r\n{154} John Barnard, a typical English merchant of the highest class,\r\ndid not hesitate to speak of the grievances as if they were all\r\nestablished and admitted, and the action of Spain as a wilful outrage\r\nupon the trade, the honor, and the safety of Great Britain.  Walpole\r\nargued that the petitioners should be heard by themselves and not by\r\ncounsel; but the main object of his speech was to appeal to the House\r\n\"not to work upon the passions where the head is to be informed.\"  Mr.\r\nRobert Wilmot thereupon arose, and replied in an oration belonging to\r\nthat \"spread-eagle\" order which is familiar to American political\r\ncontroversy.  \"Talk of working on the passions,\" this orator exclaimed;\r\n\"can any man's passions be wound up to a greater height, can any man's\r\nindignation be more raised, than every free-born Briton's must be when\r\nhe reads a letter which I have received this morning, and which I have\r\nnow in my hand?  This letter, sir, gives an account that seventy of our\r\nbrave sailors are now in chains in Spain.  Our countrymen in chains,\r\nand slaves to Spaniards!  Is not this enough to fire the coldest?  Is\r\nnot this enough to rouse all the vengeance of a national resentment?\r\nShall we sit here debating about words and forms while the sufferings\r\nof our countrymen call out loudly for redress?\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1738--An unlucky argument]\r\n\r\nPulteney himself, when speaking on the general question, professed,\r\nindeed, not to assume the charges in the petitions to be true before\r\nthey had been established, but he proceeded to deal with them on\r\nsomething very like a positive assumption that they would be\r\nestablished.  Thereupon he struck the key-note of the whole outcry that\r\nwas to be raised against the Ministry.  Could any one believe, he\r\nindignantly asked, that the Court of Spain \"would have presumed to\r\ntrifle in such a manner with any ministry but one which they thought\r\nwanted either courage or inclination to resent such treatment?\"  He\r\naccused the Ministry of \"a scandalous breach of duty\" and \"the most\r\ninfamous pusillanimity.\"  Later in the same day Sir John Barnard moved\r\nan Address to the Crown, asking for papers to be laid before the House.\r\nWalpole did not actually oppose {155} the motion, and only suggested a\r\nmodification of it, but he earnestly entreated the House not, at that\r\nmoment, to press the Sovereign for a publication of the latest\r\ndespatches.  He went so far as to let the House understand that the\r\nlatest reply from Spain was not satisfactory, and that it might be\r\nhighly injurious to the prospects of peace if it were then to be given\r\nto the world; and he pointed to the obvious fact that \"when once a\r\npaper is read in this House the contents of it cannot be long a secret\r\nto the world.\"  The King, he said, had still good hopes of being able\r\nto prevail on Spain to make an honorable and ample reparation for any\r\nwrongs that might have been done to Englishmen.  \"We ought,\" Walpole\r\npleaded, \"to wait, at least, till his Majesty shall tell us from the\r\nthrone that all hopes of obtaining satisfaction are over.  Then it will\r\nbe time enough to declare for a war with Spain.\"  Unfortunately,\r\nWalpole went on to a mode of argument which was, of all others, the\r\nbest calculated to give his enemies an advantage over him.  His\r\nlanguage was strong and clear; his sarcasm was well merited; but the\r\ntime was not suited for an appeal to such very calm common-sense as\r\nthat to which the great minister was trying in vain to address himself.\r\n\"The topic of national resentment for national injury affords,\" Walpole\r\nsaid, \"a fair field for declamation; and, to hear gentlemen speak on\r\nthat head, one would be apt to believe that victory and glory are bound\r\nto attend the resolutions of our Parliament and the efforts of our\r\narms.  But gentlemen ought to reflect that there are many instances in\r\nthe history of the world, and some in the annals of England, which\r\nprove that conquest is not always inseparable from the justest cause or\r\nmost exalted courage.\"\r\n\r\nThe hearts of the Patriots must have rejoiced when they heard such an\r\nargument from the lips of Walpole.  For what did it amount to?  Only\r\nthis--that this un-English Minister, this unworthy servant of the\r\ncrown, positively admitted into his own mind the idea that there was\r\nany possibility of England's being worsted in any war with {156} any\r\nstate or any number of states!  Fancy any one allowing such a thought\r\nto remain for an instant in his mind!  As if it were not a settled\r\nthing, specially arranged by Providence, that one Englishman is a match\r\nfor at least any six Spaniards, Frenchmen, or other contemptible\r\nforeigners!  Walpole's great intellectual want was the lack of\r\nimagination.  If he had possessed more imagination, he would have been\r\nnot only a greater orator, but a greater debater.  He would have seen\r\nmore clearly the effect of an argument on men with minds and\r\ntemperaments unlike his own.  In this particular instance the appeal to\r\nwhat he would have considered cool common-sense was utterly damaging to\r\nhim.  Pulteney pounced on him at once.  \"From longer forbearance,\" he\r\nexclaimed, \"we have everything to fear; from acting vigorously we have\r\neverything to hope.\"  He admitted that a war with Spain was to be\r\navoided, if it could be avoided with honor; but, he asked, \"will it\r\never be the opinion of an English statesman that, in order to avoid\r\ninconvenience, we are to embrace a dishonor?  Where is the brave man,\"\r\nhe demanded, \"who in a just cause will submissively lie down under\r\ninsults?  No!--in such a case he will do all that prudence and\r\nnecessity dictate in order to procure satisfaction, and leave the rest\r\nto Providence.\"  Pulteney spoke with undisguised contempt of the\r\nsensitive honor of the Spanish people.  \"I do not see,\" he\r\ndeclared--and this was meant as a keen personal thrust at Walpole--\"how\r\nwe can comply with the form of Spanish punctilio without sacrificing\r\nsome of the essentials of British honor.  Let gentlemen but consider\r\nwhether our prince's and our country's honor is not as much engaged to\r\nrevenge our injuries as the honor of the Spaniards can be to support\r\ntheir insolence.\"  There never, probably, was a House of Commons so\r\ncool-headed and cautious as not to be stirred out of reason and into\r\npassion by so well-contrived an appeal.  The appeal was followed up by\r\nothers.  \"Perhaps,\" Sir William Wyndham said, \"if we lose the character\r\nof being good fighters, we shall at least gain that {157} of being\r\nexcellent negotiators.\"  But he would not leave to Walpole the full\r\nbenefit of even that doubtful change of character.  \"The character of a\r\nmere negotiator,\" he insisted, \"had never been affected by England\r\nwithout her losing considerable, both in her interest at home and her\r\ninfluence abroad.  This truth will appear plainly to any one who\r\ncompares the figure this nation made in Europe under Queen Elizabeth\r\nwith the figure she made under her successor, King James the First.\r\nThe first never treated with an insulting enemy; the other never durst\r\nbreak with a treacherous friend.  The first thought it her glory to\r\ncommand peace; the other thought it no dishonor to beg it.  In her\r\nreign every treaty was crowned with glory; in his no peace was attended\r\nwith tranquillity; in short, her care was to improve, his to depress\r\nthe true British spirit.\"  Even the cool-headed and wise Sir John\r\nBarnard cried out that \"a dishonorable peace is worse than a\r\ndestructive war.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1738--Wyndham's taunts]\r\n\r\nWe need not go through all the series of debates in the Lords and\r\nCommons.  It is enough to say that every one of these debates made the\r\nchances of a peaceful arrangement grow less and less.  The impression\r\nof the Patriots seemed to be that Walpole was to be held responsible\r\nfor every evasion, every delay, every rash act, and every denial of\r\njustice on the part of Spain.  With this conviction, it was clear to\r\nthem that the more they attacked the Spanish Government the more they\r\nattacked and damaged Walpole.  Full of this spirit, therefore, they\r\nlaunched out in every debate about Spanish treachery, and Spanish\r\nfalsehood, and Spanish cruelty, and Spanish religious faith in a manner\r\nthat might have seemed deliberately designed to render a peaceful\r\nsettlement of any question impossible between England and Spain.  Yet\r\nwe do not believe that the main object of the Patriots was to force\r\nEngland into a war with Spain.  Their main object was to force Walpole\r\nout of office.  They were for a long time under the impression that he\r\nwould resign rather than make war.  Once he resigned, the Patriots\r\nwould very soon abate {158} their war fury, and try whether the quarrel\r\nmight not be settled in peace with honor.  But they had allowed\r\nthemselves to be driven too far along the path of war; and they had not\r\ntaken account of the fact that the great peace Minister might, after\r\nall, prefer staying in office and making war to going out of office and\r\nleaving some rival to make it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1738--Walpole almost alone]\r\n\r\nSuddenly there came to the aid of the Patriots and their policy the\r\nportentous story of Captain Jenkins and his ear.  Captain Jenkins had\r\nsailed on board his vessel, the _Rebecca_, from Jamaica for London, and\r\noff the coast of Havana he was boarded by a revenue-cutter of Spain,\r\nwhich proceeded to subject him and his vessel to the right of search.\r\nJenkins declared that he had been fearfully maltreated; that the\r\nSpanish officers had him hanged up at the yard-arm and cut down when he\r\nwas half-dead; that they slashed at his head with their cutlasses and\r\nhacked his left ear nearly off; and that, to complete the measure of\r\ntheir outrages, one of them actually tore off his bleeding ear, flung\r\nit in his face, and bade him carry it home to his king and tell him\r\nwhat had been done.  To this savage order Jenkins reported that he was\r\nready with a reply: \"I commend,\" he said, \"my soul to God, and my cause\r\nto my country\"--a very eloquent and telling little sentence, which\r\ngives good reason to think of what Jenkins could have done after\r\npreparation in the House of Commons if he could throw off such rhetoric\r\nunprepared, and in spite of the disturbing effect of having just been\r\nhalf-hanged and much mutilated.  Jenkins showed, indeed, remarkable\r\npresence of mind in every way.  He prudently brought home the severed\r\near with him, and invited all patriotic Englishmen to look at it.\r\nScepticism itself could not, for a while at all events, refuse to\r\nbelieve that the Spaniards had cut off Jenkins's ear, when, behold!\r\nthere was the ear itself to tell the story.  Later on, indeed,\r\nScepticism did begin to assert herself.  Were there not other ways, it\r\nwas asked, by which Englishmen might have lost an ear as well as by the\r\nfury of the hateful Spaniards?  {159} Were there not British pillories?\r\nWhether Jenkins sacrificed his ear to the cause of his country abroad\r\nor to the criminal laws of his country at home, it seems to be quite\r\nsettled now that his story was a monstrous exaggeration, if not a pure\r\ninvention.  Burke has distinctly stigmatized it as \"the fable of\r\nJenkins's ear.\"  The fable, however, did its work for that time.  It\r\nwas eagerly caught up and believed in; people wanted to believe in it,\r\nand the ear was splendid evidence.  The mutilation of Jenkins played\r\nmuch the same part in England that the fabulous insult of the King of\r\nPrussia to the French envoy played in the France of 1870.  The\r\neloquence of Pulteney, the earnestness of Wyndham, the intriguing\r\ngenius of Bolingbroke, seemed only to have been agencies to prepare the\r\nway for the triumph of Jenkins and his severed ear.  The outcry all\r\nover the country began to make Walpole feel at last that something\r\nwould have to be done.  His own constitutional policy came against him\r\nin this difficulty.  He had broken the power of the House of Lords and\r\nhad strengthened that of the House of Commons.  The hereditary Chamber\r\nmight perhaps be relied upon to stand firmly against a popular clamor,\r\nbut it would be impossible to expect such firmness at such a time from\r\nan elective assembly of almost any sort.  In this instance, however,\r\nWalpole found himself worse off in the House of Lords than even in the\r\nHouse of Commons.  The House of Lords was stimulated by the really\r\npowerful eloquence of Carteret and of Chesterfield, and there was no\r\nman on the ministerial side of the House who could stand up with any\r\neffect against such accomplished and unscrupulous political gladiators.\r\n\r\nWalpole appealed to the Parliament not to take any step which would\r\nrender a peaceful settlement impossible, and he promised to make the\r\nmost strenuous efforts to obtain a prompt consideration of England's\r\nclaims.  He set to work energetically for this purpose.  His\r\ndifficulties were greatly increased by the unfriendly conduct of the\r\nSpanish envoy, who was on terms of confidence with the Patriots, and\r\nwent about everywhere declaring {160} that Walpole was trying to\r\ndeceive the English people as well as the Spanish Government.  It must\r\nhave needed all Walpole's strength of will to sustain him against so\r\nmany difficulties and so many enemies at such a crisis.  It had not\r\nbeen his way to train up statesmen to help him in his work, and now he\r\nstood almost alone.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations were further complicated by the disputes between\r\nEngland and Spain as to the right of English traders to cut logwood in\r\nCampeachy Bay, and as to the settlement of the boundaries of the new\r\nEnglish colonies of Florida and Carolina in North America, and the\r\nrival claims of England and Spain to this or that strip of border\r\nterritory.  Sometimes, however, when an international dispute has to be\r\nglossed over, rather than settled, to the full satisfaction of either\r\nparty, it is found a convenient thing for diplomatists to have a great\r\nmany subjects of disputation wrapped up in one arrangement.  Walpole\r\nwas sincerely anxious to give Spain a last chance; but the Spanish\r\npeople, on their side, were stirred to bitterness and to passion by the\r\nvehement denunciations of the English Opposition.  Even then, when\r\ndaily papers were little known to the population of either London or\r\nMadrid, people in London and in Madrid did somehow get to know that\r\nthere had been fierce exchange of international dislike and defiance.\r\nWalpole, however, still clung to his policy of peace, and his influence\r\nin the House of Commons was commanding enough to get his proposals\r\naccepted there.  In the House of Lords the Ministry were nowhere in\r\ndebate.  Something, indeed, should be said for Lord Hervey, who had\r\nbeen raised to the Upper House as Baron Hervey of Ickworth in 1733, and\r\nwho made some speeches full of clear good-sense and sound moderating\r\nargument in support of Walpole's policy.  But Carteret and Chesterfield\r\nwould have been able in any case to overwhelm the Duke of Newcastle,\r\nand the Duke of Newcastle now was turning traitor to Walpole.  Stupid\r\nas Newcastle was, he was beginning to see that the day of Walpole's\r\ndestiny was nearly over, and he was taking {161} measures to act\r\naccordingly.  All that Newcastle could do as Secretary for Foreign\r\nAffairs was done to make peace impossible.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1739--The Convention]\r\n\r\nWalpole thought the time had fully come when it would be right for him\r\nto show that, while still striving for peace, he was not unprepared for\r\nwar.  He sent a squadron of line-of-battle ships to the Mediterranean\r\nand several cruisers to the West Indies, and he allowed letters of\r\nmarque to be issued.  These demonstrations had the effect of making the\r\nSpanish Government somewhat lower their tone--at least they had the\r\neffect of making that Government seem more willing to come to terms.\r\nLong negotiations as to the amount of claim on the one side and of\r\nset-off on the other were gone into both in London and Madrid.  We need\r\nnot study the figures, for nothing came of the proposed arrangement.\r\nIt was impossible that anything could come of it.  England and Spain\r\nwere quarrelling over several great international questions.  Even\r\nthese questions were themselves only symbolical of a still greater one,\r\nof a paramount question which was never put into words: the question\r\nwhether England or Spain was to have the ascendent in the new world\r\nacross the Atlantic.  Walpole and the Spanish Government drew up an\r\narrangement, or rather professed to find a basis of arrangement, for\r\nthe paying off of certain money claims.  A convention was agreed upon,\r\nand was signed on January 14, 1739.  The convention arranged that a\r\ncertain sum of money was to be paid by Spain to England within a given\r\ntime, but that this discharge of claims should not extend to any\r\ndispute between the King of Spain and the South Sea Company as holders\r\nof the Asiento Contract; and that two plenipotentiaries from each side\r\nshould meet at Madrid to settle the claims of England and Spain with\r\nregard to the rights of trade in the New World and the boundaries of\r\nCarolina and Florida.  This convention, it will be seen, left the\r\nreally important subjects of dispute exactly where they were before.\r\n\r\n{162}\r\n\r\nSuch as it was, however, it had hardly been signed before the\r\ndiplomatists were already squabbling over the extent and interpretation\r\nof its terms, and mixing it up with the attempted arrangement of other\r\nand older disputes.  Parliament opened on February 1, 1739, and the\r\nspeech from the throne told of the convention arranged with Spain.  \"It\r\nis now,\" said the Royal speech, \"a great satisfaction to me that I am\r\nable to acquaint you that the measures I have pursued have had so good\r\nan effect that a convention is concluded and ratified between me and\r\nthe King of Spain, whereby, upon consideration had of the demands on\r\nboth sides, that prince hath obliged himself to make reparation to my\r\nsubjects for their losses by a certain stipulated payment; and\r\nplenipotentiaries are therein named and appointed for redressing within\r\na limited time all those grievances and abuses which have hitherto\r\ninterrupted our commerce and navigation in the American seas, and for\r\nsettling all matters in dispute in such a manner as may for the future\r\nprevent and remove all new causes and pretences of complaint by a\r\nstrict observance of our mutual treaties and a just regard to the\r\nrights and privileges belonging to each other.\"  The King promised that\r\nthe convention should be laid before the House at once.\r\n\r\nBefore the terms of the convention were fully in the knowledge of\r\nParliament, there was already a strong dissatisfaction felt among the\r\nleading men of the Opposition.  We need not set this down to the mere\r\ndetermination of implacable partisans not to be content with anything\r\nproposed or executed by the Ministers of the Crown.  Sir John Barnard\r\nwas certainly no implacable partisan in that sense.  He was really a\r\ntrue-hearted and patriotic Englishman.  Yet Sir John Barnard was one of\r\nthe very first to predict that the convention would be found utterly\r\nunsatisfactory.  There is nothing surprising in the prediction.  The\r\nKing's own speech, which naturally made the best of things, left it\r\nevident that no important and international question had been touched\r\nby the convention.  {163} Every dispute over which war might have to be\r\nmade remained in just the same state after the convention as before.\r\nLord Carteret in the House of Lords boldly assumed that the convention\r\nmust be unsatisfactory, and even degrading, to the English people, and\r\nhe denounced it with all the eloquence and all the vigor of which he\r\nwas capable.  Lord Hervey vainly appealed to the House to bear in mind\r\nthat the convention was not yet before them.  \"Let us read it,\" he\r\nurged, \"before we condemn it.\"  Vain, indeed, was the appeal; the\r\nconvention was already condemned.  The very description of it in the\r\nspeech from the throne had condemned it in advance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1739--Petition against the Convention]\r\n\r\nThe convention was submitted to Parliament and made known to the\r\ncountry.  The reception it got was just what might have been expected.\r\nThe one general cry was that the agreement gave up or put aside every\r\nserious claim made by England.  Spain had not renounced her right of\r\nsearch; the boundaries of England's new colonies had not been defined;\r\nnot a promise was made by Spain that the Spanish officials who had\r\nimprisoned and tortured unoffending British subjects should be\r\npunished, or even brought to any manner of trial.  In the heated temper\r\nof the public the whole convention seemed an inappropriate and highly\r\noffensive farce.  On February 23d the sheriffs of the City of London\r\npresented to the House of Commons a petition against the convention.\r\nThe petition expressed the great concern and surprise of the citizens\r\nof London \"to find by the convention lately concluded between his\r\nMajesty and the King of Spain that the Spaniards are so far from giving\r\nup their (as we humbly apprehend) unjust pretension of a right to visit\r\nand search our ships on the seas of America that this pretension of\r\ntheirs is, among others, referred to the future regulation and decision\r\nof plenipotentiaries appointed on each side, whereby we apprehend it is\r\nin some degree admitted.\"  The petition referred to the \"cruel\r\ntreatment of the English sailors whose hard fate has thrown them into\r\nthe {164} hands of the Spaniards,\" and added, with a curious mixture of\r\npatriotic sentiment and practical, business-like selfishness, that \"if\r\nthis cruel treatment of English seamen were to be put up with, and no\r\nreparation demanded, it might have the effect\"--of what, does the\r\nreader think?--\"of deterring the seamen from undertaking voyages to the\r\nseas of America without an advance of wages, which that trade or any\r\nother will not be able to support.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1739--Carteret's attack]\r\n\r\nThe same petition was presented to the House of Lords by the Duke of\r\nBedford.  Lord Carteret moved that the petitioners should be heard by\r\nthemselves, and, if they should desire it, by counsel.  It was agreed,\r\nafter some debate, that the petitioners should be heard by themselves\r\nin the first instance, and that if afterwards they desired to be heard\r\nby counsel their request should be taken into consideration.  Lord\r\nChesterfield in the course of the debate contrived ingeniously to give\r\na keen stroke to the convention while declaring that he did not presume\r\nas yet to form any opinion on it, or to anticipate any discussion on\r\nits merits.  \"I cannot help,\" he said, \"saying, however, that to me it\r\nis a most unfavorable symptom of its being for the good of the nation\r\nwhen I see so strong an opposition made to it out-of-doors by those who\r\nare the most immediately concerned in its effects.\"\r\n\r\nA debate of great interest, animation, and importance took place in the\r\nHouse of Lords when the convention was laid before that assembly.  The\r\nEarl of Cholmondeley moved that an address be presented to the King to\r\nthank him for having concluded the convention.  The address was drawn\r\nup by a very dexterous hand, a master-hand.  Its terms were such as\r\nmight have conciliated the leaders of the Opposition, if indeed these\r\nwere to be conciliated by anything short of Walpole's resignation, for,\r\nwhile the address approved of all that had been done thus far, it\r\ncleverly assumed that all this was but the preliminary to a real\r\nsettlement; and by ingenuously expressing the entire reliance of the\r\nHouse on the King's taking care that proper provision should be made\r\nfor the redress of various {165} specified grievances, it succeeded in\r\nmaking it quite clear that in the opinion of the House such provision\r\nhad not yet been made.  The address concluded most significantly with\r\nan assurance to the King that \"in case your Majesty's just expectations\r\nshall not be answered, this House will heartily and zealously concur in\r\nall such measures as shall be necessary to vindicate your Majesty's\r\nhonor, and to preserve to your subjects the full enjoyment of all those\r\nrights to which they are entitled by treaty and the Law of Nations.\"\r\nAn address of this kind would seem one that might well have been moved\r\nas an amendment to a ministerial address, and understood to be\r\nobliquely a vote of censure on the advisers of the Crown.  It seems the\r\nsort of address that Carteret might have moved and Chesterfield\r\nseconded.  Carteret and Chesterfield opposed it with spirit and\r\neloquence.  \"Upon your Lordships' behavior to-day,\" said Carteret at\r\nthe close of a bitter and a passionate attack upon the Ministry and the\r\nconvention, \"depends the fate of the British Empire. . . .  This nation\r\nhas hitherto maintained her independence by maintaining her commerce;\r\nbut if either is weakened the other must fail.  It is by her commerce\r\nthat she has been hitherto enabled to stand her ground against all the\r\nopen and secret attacks of the enemies to her religion, liberties, and\r\nconstitution.  It is from commerce, my Lords, that I behold your\r\nLordships within these walls, a free, an independent assembly; but,\r\nshould any considerations influence your Lordships to give so fatal a\r\nwound to the interest and honor of this kingdom as your agreeing to\r\nthis address, it is the last time I shall have occasion to trouble this\r\nHouse.  For, my Lords, if we are to meet only to give a sanction to\r\nmeasures that overthrow all our rights, I should look upon it as a\r\nmisfortune for me to be either accessary or witness to such a\r\ncompliance.  I will not only repeat what the merchants told your\r\nLordships--that their trade is ruined--I will go further; I will say\r\nthe nobility is ruined, the whole nation is undone.  For I can call\r\nthis treaty nothing else but a mortgage of {166} your honor, a\r\nsurrender of your liberties.\"  Such language may now seem too\r\noverwrought and extravagant to have much effect upon an assembly of\r\npractical men.  But it was not language likely to be considered\r\noverwrought and extravagant at that time and during that crisis.  The\r\nOpposition had positively worked themselves into the belief that if the\r\nconvention were accepted the last day of England's strength,\r\nprosperity, and glory had come.  Carteret, besides, was talking to the\r\nEnglish public as well as to the House of Lords.  He knew what he meant\r\nwhen he denounced the enemies of England's religion as well as the\r\nenemies of England's trade.  The imputation was that the Minister\r\nhimself was a secret confederate of the enemies of the national\r\nreligion as well as the enemies of the national trade.  Men who but a\r\nfew short years before were secretly engaged in efforts at a Stuart\r\nrestoration, which certainly would not be an event much in harmony with\r\nthe spread of the Protestant faith in England, were now denouncing\r\nWalpole every day on the ground that he was caballing with Catholic\r\nSpain, the Spain of Philip the Second, the Spain of the Armada and the\r\nInquisition, the implacable enemy of England's national religion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1739--Argyle's anecdote]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Argyle made a most vehement speech against the proposed\r\naddress.  He dealt a sharp blow against the Ministry when he declared\r\nthat the whole convention was a French and not a Spanish measure.  He\r\nsaid he should never be persuaded that fear of aught that could be done\r\nby Spain could have induced ministers to accept \"this thing you call a\r\nconvention.\"  \"It is the interest of France that our navigation and\r\ncommerce should be ruined, we are the only people in the world whom\r\nFrance has reason to be apprehensive of in America, and every advantage\r\nthat Spain gains in point of commerce is gained for her. . . .  So far\r\nas I can judge from the tenor of our late behavior, our dread of France\r\nhas been the spring of all our weak and ruinous measures.  To this\r\ndread we have sacrificed the most distinguishing honors of this\r\nkingdom.  This dread of France has changed {167} every maxim of right\r\ngovernment among us.  There is no measure for the advantage of this\r\nkingdom that has been set on foot for these many years to which she has\r\nnot given a negative.  There is no measure so much to our detriment\r\ninto which she has not led us.\"  He scornfully declared that what the\r\nreasons of ministers might be for this pusillanimity he could not tell,\r\n\"for, my Lords, though I am a privy councillor I am as unacquainted\r\nwith the secrets of the Government as any private gentleman that hears\r\nme.\"  Then he told an anecdote of the late Lord Peterborough.  \"When\r\nLord Peterborough was asked by a friend one day his opinion of a\r\ncertain measure, says my lord, in some surprise, 'This is the first\r\ntime I ever heard of it.'  'Impossible,' says the other; 'why, you are\r\na privy councillor.'  'So I am,' replies his lordship, 'and there is a\r\nCabinet councillor coming up to us just now; if you ask the same\r\nquestion of him he will perhaps hold his peace, and then you will think\r\nhe is in the secret; but if he opens once his mouth about it you will\r\nfind he knows as little of it as I do.'  No, my Lords,\" exclaimed the\r\nDuke of Argyle, \"it is not being in Privy Council or in Cabinet\r\nCouncil; one must be in the Minister's counsel to know the true motives\r\nof our late proceedings.\"  The duke concluded his oration,\r\ncharacteristically, with a glorification of his own honest and\r\nimpartial heart.\r\n\r\nThe address was sure to be carried; Walpole's influence was still\r\nstrong enough to accomplish that much.  But everybody must already have\r\nseen that the convention was not an instrument capable of satisfying,\r\nor, indeed, framed with any notion of satisfying, the popular demands\r\nof England.  It was an odd sort of arrangement, partly international\r\nand partly personal; an adjustment, or attempted adjustment here of a\r\ndispute between States, and there of a dispute between rival trading\r\ncompanies.  The reconstituted South Sea Company--which had now become\r\none of the three great trading companies of England, the East India\r\nCompany and the Bank being the {168} other two--had all manner of\r\nnegotiations, arrangements, and transactions with the King of Spain.\r\nAll these affairs now became mixed up with the national claims, and\r\nwere dealt with alike in the convention.  The British plenipotentiary\r\nat the Spanish Court was--still further to complicate matters--the\r\nagent for the South Sea Company.  The convention provided that certain\r\nset-off claims of Spain should be taken into consideration as well as\r\nthe claims of England.  Spain had some demands against England for the\r\nvalue of certain vessels of the Spanish navy attacked and captured\r\nduring the reign of George the First without a declaration of war.  The\r\nclaim had been admitted in principle by England, and it became what\r\nwould be called in the law courts only a question of damages.  Then the\r\nconvention contained some stipulations concerning certain claims of\r\nSpain upon the South Sea Company; that is, on what was, after all, only\r\na private trading company.  When the anomaly was pointed out by Lord\r\nCarteret and others in the House of Lords, and it was asked how came it\r\nthat the English plenipotentiary at the Court of Spain was also the\r\nagent of the South Sea Company, it was ingeniously answered on the part\r\nof the Government that nothing could be more fitting and proper, seeing\r\nthat, as English plenipotentiary, he had to act for England with the\r\nKing of Spain, and as agent for the South Sea Company to deal with the\r\nsame sovereign in that sovereign's capacity as a great private\r\nmerchant.  Therefore the national claims were made, to a certain\r\nextent, subservient to, or dependent on, the claims of the South Sea\r\nCompany.  Whether we may think the claims of the English merchants and\r\nseamen were exaggerated or not, one thing is obvious: they could not\r\npossibly be satisfied under such a convention.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1739--The Prince's first vote]\r\n\r\nThe debate in the House of Lords was carried on by the Opposition with\r\ngreat spirit and brilliancy.  Lord Hervey defended the policy of the\r\nGovernment with dexterity.  Possibly he made as much of the case as\r\ncould be made of it.  The motion for the address was carried {169} by\r\nseventy-one votes against fifty-eight--a marked increase of strength on\r\nthe part of the Opposition.  It is to be recorded that the Prince of\r\nWales gave his first vote in Parliament to support the Opposition.  The\r\nname of \"His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales\" is the first in the\r\ndivision list of the peers who voted against the address and in favor\r\nof the policy of war.  There was nothing very mutinous in Frederick's\r\naction so far as the King was concerned.  Very likely Frederick would\r\nhave given the same vote, no matter what the King's views on the\r\nsubject.  But every one knew that George was eager for war, that he was\r\nfully convinced of his capacity to win laurels on the battle-field, and\r\nthat he was longing to wear them.  A Bonaparte prince of our own day\r\nwas described by a French literary man as an unemployed Caesar.  King\r\nGeorge believed himself an unemployed Caesar, and was clamorous for\r\nearly employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{170}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nWALPOLE YIELDS TO WAR.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1739--Horatio Walpole's prediction]\r\n\r\nThe nation was plunging, not drifting, into war.  Walpole himself,\r\nwhile still striving hard to put off any decisive step, and even yet\r\nperhaps hoping against hope that the people would return to their\r\nsenses and leave the Patriots to themselves, did not venture any longer\r\nto meet the demands of the Opposition by bold argument founded on the\r\nprinciples of justice and wisdom.  He had sometimes to talk the same\r\n\"tall talk\" as that in which the Patriots delighted, and to rave a\r\nlittle about the great deeds that would have to be done if Spain did\r\nnot listen to reason very soon.  But he still pleaded that Spain would\r\nlisten to reason soon, very soon, and that if war must come sooner or\r\nlater he preferred to take it later.  That, it need hardly be said, was\r\nnot Walpole's expression--it belongs to a later day--but it represents\r\nhis mode of argument.\r\n\r\nOn March 6th the House of Commons met for the purpose of taking the\r\nforedoomed convention into consideration.  So intense was the interest\r\ntaken in the subject, so highly strung was political feeling, that more\r\nthan four hundred members were in their places at eight o'clock in the\r\nmorning.  Seldom indeed is anxiety expressed in so emphatic and\r\nconclusive a form among members of the House of Commons.  Readers may\r\nremember one day within recent years when a measure of momentous\r\nimportance was to be introduced into the House of Commons, and when,\r\nlong before eight in the morning, every seat in the House was occupied.\r\nOn this March 6, 1739, the House resolved itself into committee, and\r\nspent the whole {171} day in hearing some of the merchants and other\r\nwitnesses against the convention.  The whole of the next day\r\n(Wednesday) was occupied in the reading of documents bearing on the\r\nsubject, and it was not until Thursday that the debate began.  The\r\ndebate was more memorable for what followed it than for itself.  In\r\nitself it was the familiar succession of fierce and unscrupulous\r\nattacks on the policy of peace, mixed up with equally fierce but\r\ncertainly very well-deserved attacks on the character of the\r\nconvention.  William Pitt wound up his speech by declaring that \"this\r\nconvention, I think from my soul, is nothing but a stipulation for\r\nnational ignominy; an illusory expedient to baffle the resentment of\r\nthe nation; a truce without a suspension of hostilities on the part of\r\nSpain; on the part of England a suspension, as to Georgia, of the first\r\nlaw of nature, self-preservation and self-defence; a surrender of the\r\nrights and the trade of England to the mercy of plenipotentiaries, and,\r\nin this infinitely highest and sacred point, future security, not only\r\ninadequate, but directly repugnant to the resolutions of Parliament and\r\nthe gracious promise from the throne.  The complaints of your\r\ndespairing merchants, the voice of England, have condemned it; be the\r\nguilt of it upon the head of its adviser!  God forbid that this\r\ncommittee should share the guilt by approving it!\"\r\n\r\nOne point in the debate is worthy of notice.  The address to the King\r\napproving of the convention was moved by Horatio Walpole, the\r\ndiplomatist, brother of Sir Robert.  In the course of his speech\r\nHoratio Walpole declared that the outbreak of war between England and\r\nany great continental State would be certain to be followed by a new\r\nblow struck by the Pretender and his followers.  Some of the orators of\r\nOpposition spoke with immense scorn of the possibility of a Jacobite\r\nmovement ever again being heard of in England.  The Walpoles both\r\ngenerally understood pretty well what they were talking about.  The\r\nprediction of Horatio Walpole came true.\r\n\r\n{172}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1739--The secession]\r\n\r\nThe address was carried by 260 against 232.  The ministerial majority\r\nhad run down to 28.  Next day the battle was renewed.  According to\r\nparliamentary usage, the report of the address was brought up, and\r\nPulteney seized the opportunity to make another vehement attack on the\r\nconvention and the ministers.  He accused the Prime-minister of meanly\r\nstooping to the dictates of a haughty, insolent Court, and of bartering\r\naway the lives and liberties of Englishmen for \"a sneaking, temporary,\r\ndisgraceful expedient.\"  But the interest of the day was to come.  The\r\naddress was agreed to by a majority of 262 against 234.  This was\r\nexactly the same majority as before, only with both sides slightly\r\nstrengthened.  Then the principal leaders of Opposition thought the\r\ntime had come for them to intervene with a deliberately planned _coup\r\nde théâtre_.  Acting, it is understood, under the advice of\r\nBolingbroke, they had been looking out for an opportunity to secede\r\nfrom the House of Commons on the ground that it was vain for patriotic\r\nmen to try to do their duty to their country in a House of which the\r\nmajority, narrow though it was, was yet the absolute slave of such a\r\nminister as Walpole.  They hoped that such a step would have two\r\neffects.  It would, they believed, create an immense sensation all over\r\nEngland and make them the heroes of the hour; and they fondly hoped\r\nthat it would scare Walpole, and prevent him from passing in their\r\nabsence the measures which their presence was unable to prevent.  Such,\r\nwe have no doubt, were the ideas of Bolingbroke and of Pulteney and of\r\nothers; but we do not say that they were the ideas of the man who was\r\nintrusted with the duty of announcing the intentions of his party.\r\nThis was Sir William Wyndham; and we do not believe that any hope of\r\nbeing one of the heroes of the hour entered for a moment into his mind.\r\nHe only in a general honest thought, and common good to all, made one\r\nof them.  Wyndham rose, and in a speech of great solemnity announced\r\nthat he was about to pay his last duty to his country as a member of\r\nthat {117} House.  What hope, he asked, was there when the eloquence of\r\none man had so great an effect within the walls of the House of\r\nCommons, and the unanimous voice of a brave, suffering people without\r\nhad so little?  He implied that the majority of the House must have\r\nbeen determined \"by arguments that we have not heard.\"  He bade an\r\nadieu to Parliament.  \"Perhaps,\" he said, \"when another Parliament\r\nshall succeed, I may again be at liberty to serve my country in the\r\nsame capacity.\"  In other words, if the next Parliament should declare\r\nwar on Spain after having got rid of Walpole, then Wyndham and his\r\nfriends might be prevailed on to return.  \"I therefore appeal to a\r\nfuture, free, uninfluenced Parliament.  Let it be the judge of my\r\nconduct and that of my friends on this occasion.  Meantime I shall\r\nconclude with doing that duty to my country which I am still at liberty\r\nto perform--which is to pray for its preservation.  May, therefore,\r\nthat Power which has so often and so visibly before interposed on\r\nbehalf of the rights and liberties of this nation continue its care\r\nover us at this worst and most dangerous juncture; while the insolence\r\nof enemies without, and the influence of corruption within, threaten\r\nthe ruin of her Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech created, as will readily be imagined, an immense sensation\r\nin the House.  A member of the Administration, one of the Pelhams, lost\r\nhis head so completely that he sprang up with the intention of moving\r\nthat Wyndham be committed to the Tower.  Walpole, who was not in the\r\nhabit of losing his head, prevented the ardent Pelham from carrying out\r\nhis purpose.  Walpole knew quite well that something better could be\r\ndone than to evoke for any of the Patriots the antiquated terrors of\r\nthe Tower.  Walpole delivered a speech which, for its suppressed\r\npassion and its stern severity, was well equal to the occasion.  The\r\nthreat of Wyndham and his friends gave him, he said, no uneasiness.\r\nThe friends of the Parliament and the nation were obliged to them for\r\npulling off the mask--\"We can be upon our guard {174} against open\r\nrebellion; it is hard to guard against secret treason.\"  \"The faction I\r\nspeak of never sat in this House, they never joined in any public\r\nmeasure of the Government but with a view to distress it and to serve a\r\nPopish interest.\"  Walpole was delighted to have an opportunity of\r\npaying off the Opposition for their constant denunciations of his\r\nalleged subservience to the throne of France, by flinging in Wyndham's\r\nteeth his old devotion to the cause of the Stuarts.  \"The gentleman,\"\r\nhe said, \"who is now the mouth of this faction was looked upon as the\r\nhead of those traitors who, twenty-five years ago, conspired the\r\ndestruction of their country and of the royal family to set a Popish\r\nPretender on the throne.  He was seized by the vigilance of the then\r\nGovernment and pardoned by its clemency, but all the use he has\r\nungratefully made of that clemency has been to qualify himself\r\naccording to law, that he and his party may some time or other have an\r\nopportunity to overthrow all law.\"  For himself, Walpole declared he\r\nwas only afraid that the gentlemen would not be as good as their word,\r\nand that they would return to Parliament.  \"For I remember,\" he said,\r\n\"that in the case of their favorite prelate who was impeached of\r\ntreason\"--Atterbury--\"the same gentleman and his faction made the same\r\nresolution.  They then went off like traitors as they were; but their\r\nretreat had not the detestable effect they expected and wished, and\r\ntherefore they returned.  Ever since they have persevered in the same\r\ntreasonable intention of serving that interest by distressing the\r\nGovernment.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1739--The policy of secession]\r\n\r\nThe House broke up in wild excitement; such excitement as had not been\r\nknown there since the Excise Bill or the South Sea Bubble.  About sixty\r\nof the Opposition kept for the time their promise of secession.  Sir\r\nJohn Barnard, and two or three other men of mark in the party, had the\r\ngood-sense to see that they could serve their cause, whatever it might\r\nbe, better by remaining at their posts than by withdrawing from public\r\nlife.  The secession of a party from the House of Commons can {175}\r\nhardly ever be anything but a mistake.  We are speaking now, of course,\r\nof a secession more serious and prolonged than that which concerns a\r\nparticular stage of some measure.  There have been occasions when the\r\nparty in Opposition, after having fought their best against some\r\nobnoxious measure in all its former stages, and finding that further\r\nstruggle would be unavailing, consider that they can make their protest\r\nmore effectively, and draw public attention more directly to the nature\r\nof the controversy, by withdrawing in a body from the House of Commons,\r\nand leaving the Government alone with their responsibility.  Such a\r\ncourse as this has been taken more than once in our own days.  It can\r\ndo no practical harm to the public interest, and it may do some service\r\nas a political demonstration.  But a genuine secession, a prolonged\r\nsecession, must, in the nature of things, do harm.  It is wrong in\r\nprinciple; for a man is elected to the House of Commons in order that\r\nhe may represent his constituents and maintain their interests there.\r\nTo do that is his plain duty and business, which is not to be put away\r\nfor the sake of indulging in any petulant or romantic impulse to\r\nwithdraw from an assembly because one cannot have one's way there.  No\r\nmatter how small the minority on one side of the question, we have seen\r\nover and over again what work of political education may be done by a\r\nresolute few who will not cease to put forward their arguments and to\r\nfight for their cause.\r\n\r\nIn the case with which we are now dealing Wyndham and his friends only\r\ngratified Walpole by their unwise course of action.  They enabled him\r\nto get through some of the work of the session smoothly and easily.  A\r\ndivision hardly ever was known, and of some debates on really important\r\nquestions there is positively no record.  There was, for instance, a\r\nmotion made in the House of Commons on March 30th for leave to bring in\r\na Bill \"to repeal so much of an Act passed in the 25th of King Charles\r\nthe Second, entitled An Act for preventing {176} Dangers which may\r\nhappen from Popish Recusants, as obligeth all persons who are admitted\r\nto any office, civil or military, to receive the Sacrament of the\r\nLord's Supper within a time limited by the said Act; and for explaining\r\nand amending so much of the said Act as relates to the declaration\r\nagainst trans-substantiation.\"  This proposal was supported by some of\r\nWalpole's friends; and, of course, Walpole himself was in favor of its\r\nprinciple.  But he was not disposed in the least to trouble his master\r\nor himself about the repeal of Test Acts, either in the interest of the\r\nRoman Catholics or the Non-conformists, and he opposed the motion.\r\nThere was a long debate, but the record says that \"the particulars of\r\nit not having been made public, we can give no further account of it,\r\nbut that many of the members being retired from Parliament, as before\r\nmentioned, and most of those concerned in the Administration being\r\nagainst it, the question passed in the negative, 188 noes to 89 yeas.\"\r\n\r\nThe Government were also enabled to pass without any resistance in the\r\nHouse of Commons a very ignoble and shabby little treaty with the King\r\nof Denmark, by which England undertook to pay to Denmark seventy\r\nthousand pounds a year for three years on condition that Denmark should\r\nfurnish to King George a body of troops, six thousand men in all, these\r\ntroops to be ready at any time when the King of England should call for\r\nthem, and he being bound to pay a certain sum \"by way of levy-money\"\r\nfor each soldier.  This was not really an English measure at all.  It\r\nhad nothing to do with the interests of England, or of George as\r\nSovereign of England.  It was merely an arrangement between the King of\r\nDenmark and the Elector of Hanover, and was the settlement or\r\ncomposition of a miserable quarrel about a castle and a scrap of ground\r\nwhich George had bought from the Duchy of Holstein, and which Denmark\r\nclaimed as her own.  The dispute led to a military scuffle, in which\r\nthe Danes got the worst of it, and it might have led to a war but that\r\nthe timely treaty and the promised annual {177} payment brought the\r\nKing of Denmark round to George's views.  The treaty met with some\r\nopposition, or at all events some remonstrance, in the House of Lords.\r\nCarteret, however, gave it his support, and declared that he thought\r\nthe treaty a wise and a just measure.  Carteret was always in favor of\r\nthe Hanoverian policy of King George.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1739--Walpole has it his own way]\r\n\r\nSo far, therefore, Walpole had things his own way.  He was very glad to\r\nbe rid of the Opposition for the time.  He might well have addressed\r\nthem in words like those which a modern American humorist says were\r\ncalled out with enthusiasm to him when he was taking leave of his\r\nfriends and about to sail for Europe: \"Don't hurry back--stay away\r\nforever if you like.\"\r\n\r\nBut war was to come all the same.  Walpole was not strong enough to\r\nprevent that.  The incessant attacks made in both Houses of Parliament\r\nhad inflamed the people of Spain into a passion as great as that which\r\nin England was driving Walpole before it.  The Spanish Government would\r\nnot pay the amount arranged for in the convention.  They put forward as\r\ntheir justification the fact, or alleged fact, that the South Sea\r\nCompany had failed to discharge its obligations to Spain.  The British\r\nsquadron had been sent to the Mediterranean, and the Spaniards declared\r\nthat this was a threat and an insult to the King of Spain.  The claim\r\nto the right of search was asserted more loudly and vehemently than\r\never.  Near to the close of the session there was a passionate debate\r\nin the House of Lords on the whole subject.  The Opposition insisted\r\nthat the honor of England would not admit of further delay, and that\r\nthe sword must be unsheathed at once.  The Duke of Newcastle could only\r\nappeal to the House on the part of the Government not to pass a\r\nresolution calling upon the King to declare war, but to leave it to the\r\nKing to choose his own opportunity.  Newcastle feebly pleaded that to\r\npass a resolution would be to give untimely warning to England's\r\nenemies, and reminded the House that England was likely to have to\r\n{178} encounter an enemy stronger and more formidable than Spain.  Lord\r\nHardwicke and Lord Scarborough could only urge on the House the\r\nprudence and propriety of leaving the time and manner of action in the\r\nhands of the Ministry, in the full assurance that the ministers would\r\ndo all that the nation desired.  In other words, the ministers were\r\nalready pledged to war.  The session was brought to an end on June\r\n14th, and on October 19th England declared war against Spain.  The\r\nproclamation was greeted with the wildest outburst of popular\r\nenthusiasm; an enthusiasm which at the time seemed to run through all\r\norders and classes.  Joy-bells rang out their inspiring chimes from\r\nevery church.  Exulting crowds shouted in a stentorian chorus of\r\ndelight.  Cities flamed with illuminations at night.  The Prince of\r\nWales and some of the leaders of the Opposition took part in the public\r\ndemonstration.  The Prince stopped at the door of a tavern in Fleet\r\nStreet, as if he were another Prince Hal carousing with his mates, and\r\ncalled for a goblet of wine, which he drank to the toast of coming\r\nvictory.  The bitter words of Walpole have indeed been often quoted,\r\nbut they cannot be omitted here: \"They may ring their bells now; before\r\nlong they will be wringing their hands.\"  Walpole was thinking, no\r\ndoubt, of the Family Compact, and of \"the King over the Water.\"\r\n\r\nParliament met in November, 1739, and the seceders were all in their\r\nplaces again.  They had been growing heartily sick of secession and\r\ninactivity, and they insisted on regarding the declaration of war\r\nagainst Spain as a justification of their return to parliamentary life.\r\nPulteney made himself their spokesman in the debate on the Address.\r\n\"Our step,\" he said, meaning their secession, \"is so fully justified by\r\nthe declaration of war, so universally approved, that any further\r\nvindication of it would be superfluous.\"  They seceded when they felt\r\nthat their opposition was ineffectual, and that their presence was only\r\nmade use of to give the appearance of a fair debate to that which had\r\nalready been ratified.  \"The {179} state of affairs is now changed; the\r\nmeasures of the ministers are altered; and the same regard for the\r\nhonor and welfare of their country that determined these gentlemen to\r\nwithdraw has now brought them hither once more, to give their advice\r\nand assistance in those measures which they then pointed out as the\r\nonly means of asserting and retrieving them.\"  Walpole's reply was a\r\nlittle ungracious.  It was, in effect, that he thought the country\r\ncould have done very well without the services of the honorable\r\nmembers; that they never would have been missed; and that the nation\r\nwas generally wide-awake to the fact that the many useful and popular\r\nmeasures passed towards the close of the last session owed their\r\npassing to the happy absence from Parliament of Pulteney and his\r\nfriends.  One might well excuse Walpole if he became sometimes a little\r\nimpatient of the attitudinizing and the vaporing of the Patriots.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1739-1740--Death of Wyndham]\r\n\r\nOne of the Patriots was not long to trouble Walpole.  On July 17, 1740,\r\nSir William Wyndham died.  Wyndham was a man of honor and a man of\r\nintellect.  We have already in this history described his abilities and\r\nhis character, his political purity, his personal consistency.  He had\r\nalways been in poor health; his incessant parliamentary work certainly\r\ncould not have tended to improve his physical condition; and he was but\r\nfifty-three years old when he died.  Had he lived yet a little longer\r\nhe must have taken high office in a new administration, and he might\r\nhave proved himself a statesman as well as a party leader and a\r\nparliamentary orator.  Perhaps, on the whole, it is better for his fame\r\nthat he should have been spared the test.  It proved too much for\r\nCarteret.  We may give Bolingbroke credit for sincerity when he poured\r\nout, in letter after letter, his lament for Wyndham's death.  There is\r\nsomething, however, characteristic of the age and the man in\r\nBolingbroke's instant assumption that Walpole must regard the death as\r\na fine stroke of good-luck for himself.  \"What a star has our\r\nMinister,\" Bolingbroke wrote to a friend--\"Wyndham dead!\"  It seems\r\nstrange {180} that Bolingbroke should not even then have been able to\r\nsee that the star of the great minister was about to set.  The death of\r\nWyndham brought Walpole no profit; gave him no security.  But Wyndham's\r\npremature end withdrew a picturesque and a chivalric figure from the\r\nlife of the House of Commons.  He was one of the few, the very few,\r\nreally unselfish and high-minded men who then occupied a prominent\r\nposition in Parliament.  He was not fighting for his own hand.  He was\r\nnot a mere partisan.  He had enough of the statesman in him to be able\r\nto accept established facts, and not to argue with the inexorable.  He\r\nwas not a scholar like Carteret, or an orator like Bolingbroke; he was\r\nnot an ascetic; but he had stainless political integrity, and was a\r\ntrue friend to his friends.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1740--Walpole's fatal mistake]\r\n\r\nWalpole committed the great error of his life when he consented to\r\naccept the war policy which his enemies had proclaimed, and which he\r\nhad so long resisted.  Even if we consider his conduct not as a\r\nquestion of principle, but only as one of mere expediency, it must\r\nstill be condemned.  No statesman is likely to be able to conduct a\r\ngreat war whose heart is all the time filled only with a longing for\r\npeace.  Walpole was perhaps less likely than any other statesman to\r\nmake a war minister.  He could not throw his heart into the work.  He\r\nwent to it because he was driven to it.  It was simply a choice between\r\ndeclaring war and resigning office, and he merely preferred to declare\r\nwar.  This is not the temper, these are not the conditions, for\r\ncarrying out a policy of war.  But, as a question of principle,\r\nWalpole's conduct admits of no defence.  His plain duty was to refuse\r\nto administer a policy of which he did not approve, and to leave the\r\nresponsibility of the war to those who did approve of it.  It is said\r\nthat he tendered his resignation to the King; that the King implored\r\nWalpole to stand by him--not to desert him in that hour of need--and\r\nthat Walpole at last consented to remain in office.  This may possibly\r\nbe true; some such form may have been gone through.  But it does not\r\nalter the historical judgment about Walpole's {181} action.  Walpole\r\nought not to have gone through any forms at such a time.  He hated the\r\nwar policy; he knew that he was not a war minister; he ought to have\r\nrefused to administer such a policy, and have stood by his refusal.  It\r\nis said that, in his conversation with the King, Walpole pointed out\r\nthat to the minister would be attributed every disaster that might\r\noccur during a war, his opposition to which would always be considered\r\na crime.  But would there be anything very unfair or unreasonable in\r\nthat?  When a statesman who has fought hard against a war policy\r\nsuddenly yields to it, and consents to put it into action, would it be\r\nunreasonable, if disaster should occur, that his enemies should say,\r\n\"This comes of trying to conduct a war in which you have no heart or\r\nspirit?\"  Burke passes severe censure even on Walpole's manner of\r\ncarrying on his opposition to the war party.  \"Walpole,\" says Burke,\r\n\"never manfully put forward the strength of his cause; he temporized;\r\nhe managed; and, adopting very nearly the sentiments of his\r\nadversaries, he opposed their inferences.  This, for a political\r\ncommander, is the choice of a weak post.  His adversaries had the best\r\nof the argument as he handled it; not as the reason and justice of his\r\ncause enabled him to manage it.\"  Then Burke adds this emphatic\r\nsentence: \"I say this after having seen, and with some care examined,\r\nthe original documents concerning certain important transactions of\r\nthose times; they perfectly satisfied me of the extreme injustice of\r\nthat war, and of the falsehood of the colors which, to his own ruin,\r\nand guided by a mistaken policy, he suffered to be daubed over that\r\nmeasure.\"  To his own ruin?  Yes, truly.  The consequence of Walpole's\r\nsurrender was to himself and his political career fatal--irretrievable.\r\nHis wrong-doing brought its heavy punishment along with it.  He has yet\r\nto struggle for a short while against fate and his own fault; he has\r\nstill to receive a few successive humiliations before the great and\r\nfinal fall.  But the day of his destiny is over.  For all real work his\r\ncareer may be said to have closed on the day when he consented to\r\nremain in {182} office and become the instrument of his enemies.  With\r\nthat day he passed out of the real world and life of politics, and\r\nbecame as a shadow among shadows.\r\n\r\nWe need not trouble ourselves much about the war with Spain.  On\r\nneither side of the struggle was anything done which calls for grave\r\nhistorical notice.  Every little naval success one of our admirals\r\naccomplished in the American seas, as they were then called, was\r\nglorified as if it had been an anticipated Trafalgar; and our admirals\r\naccomplished blunders and failures as well as petty victories.  The\r\nquarrel very soon became swallowed up in the great war which broke out\r\non the death of Charles the Sixth of Spain, and the occupation of\r\nSilesia by Frederick of Prussia.  England lent a helping hand in the\r\ngreat war, but its tale does not belong to English history.  Two\r\npredictions of Walpole's were very quickly realized.  France almost\r\nimmediately took part with Spain, in accordance with the terms of the\r\nFamily Compact.  In 1740 an organization was got up in Scotland by a\r\nnumber of Jacobite noblemen and other gentlemen, pledging themselves to\r\nstake fortune and life on the Stuart cause whenever its standard,\r\nsupported by foreign auxiliaries, should be raised in Great Britain.\r\nThis was the shadow cast before by the coming events of\r\n\"forty-five\"--events which Walpole was not destined to see.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1743--George at Dettingen]\r\n\r\nOne link of personal interest connects England with the war.  George\r\nsent a body of British and Hanoverian troops into the field to support\r\nMaria Theresa of Hungary.  The troops were under the command of Lord\r\nStair, the veteran soldier and diplomatist, whose brilliant career has\r\nbeen already described in this history.  George himself joined Lord\r\nStair and fought at the battle of Dettingen, where the French were\r\ncompletely defeated; one of the few creditable events of the war, so\r\nfar as English arms were concerned.  George behaved with great courage\r\nand spirit.  If the poor, stupid, puffy, plucky little man did but know\r\nwhat a strange, picturesque, memorable figure he was as he stood up\r\nagainst the enemy at that battle of Dettingen!  {183} The last king of\r\nEngland who ever appeared with his army in the battle-field!  There, as\r\nhe gets down off his unruly horse, determined to trust to his own stout\r\nlegs--because, as he says, they will not run away--there is the last\r\nsuccessor of the Williams, and the Edwards, and the Henrys; the last\r\nsuccessor of the Conquerer, and Edward the First, and the Black Prince,\r\nand Henry the Fourth, and Henry of Agincourt, and William of Nassau;\r\nthe last English king who faces a foe in battle.  With him went out, in\r\nthis country, the last tradition of the old and original duty and right\r\nof royalty--the duty and the right to march with the national army in\r\nwar.  A king in older days owed his kingship to his capacity for the\r\nbrave squares of war.  In other countries the tradition lingers still.\r\nA continental sovereign, even if he have not really the generalship to\r\nlead an army, must appear on the field of battle, and at least seem to\r\nlead it, and he must take his share of danger with the rest.  But in\r\nEngland the very idea has died out, never in all probability to come\r\nback to life again.  If one were to follow some of the examples set us\r\nin classical imaginings, we might fancy the darkening clouds on the\r\nwest, where the sun has sunk over the battlefield, to be the phantom\r\nshapes of the great English kings who led their people and their armies\r\nin the wars.  Unkingly, indeed unheroic, little of kin with them they\r\nmight well have thought that panting George; and yet they might have\r\nlooked on him with interest as the last of their proud race.\r\n\r\nWe have been anticipating a little; let us anticipate a little more and\r\nsay what came of the war, so far as the claims originally made by\r\nEngland, or rather by the Patriots, were concerned.  When peace was\r\narranged, nearly ten years after, the _asiento_ was renewed for four\r\nyears, and not one word was said in the treaty about Spain renouncing\r\nthe right of search.  The great clamor of the Patriots had been that\r\nSpain must be made to proclaim publicly her renunciation of the right\r\nof search; and when a treaty of settlement came to be drawn up not a\r\n{184} sentence was inserted about the right of search, and no English\r\nstatesman troubled his head about the matter.  The words of Burke,\r\ntaken out of one of his writings from which a quotation has already\r\nbeen made, form the most fitting epitaph on the war as it first broke,\r\nout--the war of Jenkins's ear.  \"Some years after it was my fortune,\"\r\nsays Burke, \"to converse with many of the principal actors against that\r\nminister (Walpole), and with those who principally excited that clamor.\r\nNone of them--no, not one--did in the least defend the measure or\r\nattempt to justify their conduct.  They condemned it as freely as they\r\nwould have done in commenting upon any proceeding in history in which\r\nthey were totally unconcerned.\"  Let it not be forgotten, however,\r\nthat, while this is a condemnation of the Patriots, it is no less a\r\ncondemnation of Walpole.  The policy which none of them could\r\nafterwards defend, which he himself had always condemned and\r\nreprobated, he nevertheless undertook to carry out rather than submit\r\nto be driven from office.  Schiller in one of his dramas mourns over\r\nthe man who stakes reputation, health, and all upon success--and no\r\nsuccess in the end.  It was to be thus with Walpole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{185}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\n\"AND WHEN HE FALLS----\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1741--Motions against Walpole]\r\n\r\nWalpole soon found that his enemies were no less bitter against him, no\r\nless resolute to harass and worry him, now that he had stooped to be\r\ntheir instrument and do their work.  Every unsuccessful movement in the\r\nwar was made the occasion of a motion for papers, a motion for an\r\ninquiry, a vote of want of confidence, or some other direct or indirect\r\nattack upon the Prime-minister.  In the House of Lords, Lord Carteret\r\nwas especially unsparing, and was brilliantly supported by Lord\r\nChesterfield.  In the House of Commons, Samuel Sandys, a clever and\r\nrespectable country gentleman from Worcestershire, made himself quite a\r\nsort of renown by his motions against Walpole.  On Friday, February 13,\r\n1741, a motion was made in each of the Houses of Parliament calling on\r\nthe King \"to remove the Right Honorable Sir Robert Walpole, Knight of\r\nthe most noble Order of the Garter, First Commissioner for executing\r\nthe office of Treasurer of the Exchequer, Chancellor and\r\nUnder-Treasurer of the Exchequer, and one of his Majesty's most\r\nhonorable Privy Council, from his Majesty's presence and councils\r\nforever.\"  In the House of Lords the motion was made by Lord Carteret;\r\nin the House of Commons by Mr. Sandys, who was nicknamed \"the\r\nmotion-maker.\"  The motion was lost by a large majority in the House of\r\nLords; and in the House of Commons there were only 106 for it, while\r\nthere were 290 against it.  This was a victory; but it did not deceive\r\nWalpole.  There would soon be a new Parliament, and Walpole knew very\r\nwell that the country was already growing sick of the unmeaning war,\r\nand that he was held {186} responsible alike for the war policy which\r\nhe had so long opposed, and the many little disasters of the war with\r\nwhich he had nothing to do.  In Walpole's utter emergency he actually\r\nauthorized a friend to apply for him to James Stuart at Rome, in the\r\nhope of inducing James to obtain for him the support of some of the\r\nJacobites at the coming elections.  What he could possibly have thought\r\nhe could promise James in return for the solicited support it is hard,\r\nindeed, to imagine; for no one can question the sincerity of Walpole's\r\nattachment to the reigning House.  Perhaps if James had consented to go\r\ninto the negotiations Walpole might have made some pledges about the\r\nEnglish Catholics.  Nothing came of it, however.  James did not seem to\r\ntake to the suggestion, and Walpole was left to do the best he could\r\nwithout any helping hand from Rome.  Lord Stanhope thinks it not\r\nunlikely that King George was fully aware of this curious attempt to\r\nget James Stuart to bring his influence to bear on the side of Walpole.\r\nThe elections were fought out with unusual vehemence of partisanship,\r\neven for those days, and the air was thick with caricatures of Walpole\r\nand lampoons on his policy and his personal character.  When the\r\nelection storm was over, it was found that the Ministry had distinctly\r\nlost ground.  In Scotland and in parts of the west of England the loss\r\nwas most manifest.  Walpole now was as well convinced as any of his\r\nenemies could be that the fall was near.  He must have felt like some\r\ndesperate duellist, who, having fought his fiercest and his best, is\r\nconscious at last that his strength is gone; that he is growing fainter\r\nand fainter from loss of blood; and conscious, too, that his antagonist\r\nalready perceives this and exults in the knowledge, and is already\r\nseeking out with greedy eye for the best place in which to give the\r\nfinal touch of the rapier's point.\r\n\r\nThe new Parliament met on December 1, 1741, and re-elected Mr. Onslow\r\nas Speaker.  The speech from the throne was almost entirely taken up\r\nwith somewhat cheerless references to the war with Spain, and the\r\ndebate on {187} the address was naturally made the occasion for new\r\nattacks on the policy of the Government.  \"Certainly, my Lords,\" said\r\nChesterfield, \"it is not to be hoped that we should regain what we have\r\nlost but by measures different from those which have reduced us to our\r\npresent state, and by the assistance of other counsellors than those\r\nwho have sunk us into the contempt and exposed us to the ravages of\r\nevery nation throughout the world.\"  This was the string that had been\r\nharped upon in all the pamphlets and letters of the Patriots during the\r\nprogress of the war.  Walpole had done it all; Walpole had delayed the\r\nwar to gratify France; he had prevented the war from being carried on\r\nvigorously in order to assist France; he had obtained a majority in\r\nParliament by the most outrageous and systematic corruption; he was an\r\nenemy of his country, and so forth.  All these charges and allegations\r\nwere merely founded on Walpole's public policy.  They simply came to\r\nthis, that a certain course of action taken by Walpole, with the\r\napproval of Parliament, was declared by Walpole to have been taken from\r\npatriotic motives and for the good of England, and was declared by his\r\nenemies to have been taken from unpatriotic motives and in the interest\r\nof France.  It was of no avail for Walpole to point out that everything\r\nhe had done thus far had been done with the approval of the House of\r\nCommons.  The answer was ready: \"Exactly; and there is another of your\r\ncrimes: you bribed and corrupted every former House of Commons.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1742--Pulteney's attempt to refer]\r\n\r\nOn January 21, 1742, Pulteney brought forward a motion to refer all the\r\npapers concerning the war, which had just been laid on the table, to a\r\nselect committee of the House, in order that the committee should\r\nexamine the papers, and report to the House concerning them.  This was\r\nsimply a motion for a committee of inquiry into the manner in which\r\nministers were carrying on the war.  The House was the fullest that had\r\nbeen known for many years.  Pulteney had 250 votes with him; Walpole\r\nhad only 253--a majority of three.  Some of the efforts made {188} on\r\nboth sides to bring up the numbers on this occasion remind one of\r\nHogarth's picture of the \"Polling Day,\" where the paralytic, the\r\nmaimed, the deaf, and the dying are carried up to record their vote.\r\nMen so feeble from sickness that they could not stand were brought down\r\nto the House wrapped up like mummies, and lifted through the division.\r\nWalpole seems to have surpassed himself in the speech which he made in\r\nhis own defence.  At least such is the impression we get from the\r\ndeclaration of some of those who heard it, Pulteney himself among the\r\nrest.  Pulteney always sat near to Walpole on the Treasury bench;\r\nPulteney, of course, not admitting that he had in any way changed his\r\npolitical principles since Walpole and he were friends and colleagues.\r\nPulteney offered to Walpole his warm congratulations on his speech, and\r\nadded, \"Well, nobody can do what you can.\"  Pulteney might afford to be\r\ngracious.  The victory of three was a substantial defeat.  It was the\r\nprologue to a defeat which was to be formal as well as substantial.\r\nThe Patriots were elated.  The fruit of their long labors was about to\r\ncome at last.\r\n\r\nAll this was telling hard upon Walpole's health.  We get melancholy\r\naccounts of the cruel work which his troubles were making with that\r\nframe which once might have seemed to be of iron.  The robust animal\r\nspirits which could hardly be kept down in former days had now changed\r\ninto a mournful and even a moping temperament.  His son, Horace\r\nWalpole, gives a very touching picture of him in these decaying years.\r\n\"He who was asleep as soon as his head touched the pillow--for I have\r\nfrequently known him snore ere they had drawn his curtains--now never\r\nsleeps above an hour without waking; and he who at dinner always forgot\r\nhe was minister, and was more gay and thoughtless than all the company,\r\nnow sits without speaking, and with his eyes fixed for an hour\r\ntogether.\"  Many of his friends implored him to give up the hopeless\r\nand thankless task.  Walpole still clung to office; still tried new\r\nstratagems; planned new combinations; racked {189} his brain for new\r\ndevices.  He actually succeeded in inducing the King to have an offer\r\nmade to the Prince of Wales of an addition of fifty thousand pounds a\r\nyear to his income, provided that Frederick would desist from\r\nopposition to the measures of the Government.  The answer was what\r\nevery one--every one, surely, but Walpole, must have expected.  The\r\nprince professed any amount of duty to his father, but as regards\r\nWalpole he was implacable.  He would listen to no terms of compromise\r\nwhile the great enemy of himself and of his party remained in office.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1742--\"The thanes fly from me!\"]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Newcastle had notoriously turned traitor to Walpole.  Lord\r\nWilmington, whose \"evaporation\" as Sir Spencer Compton marked Walpole's\r\nfirst great success under George the Second, was approached by some of\r\nWalpole's enemies, and besought to employ his influence with the King\r\nto get Walpole dismissed.  It is said that even Lord Hervey now began\r\nto hold aloof from him.  It was only a mere question of time and the\r\nhour.  Walpole's enemies were already going about proclaiming their\r\ndetermination not to be satisfied with merely turning him out of\r\noffice; he must be impeached and brought to condign punishment.\r\nWalpole's friends--those of them who were left--made this another\r\nreason for imploring him to resign.  They pleaded that by a timely\r\nresignation he might at least save himself from the peril of an\r\nimpeachment.  Walpole showed a determination which had much that was\r\npitiable and something that was heroic about it.  He would not\r\nfly--bear-like, he would fight the course.\r\n\r\nThe final course soon came.  The battle was on a petition from the\r\ndefeated candidates for Chippenham, who claimed the seats on the ground\r\nof an undue election and return.  Election petitions were then heard\r\nand decided by the House of Commons itself, and not by a committee of\r\nthe House, as in more recent days.  The decision of the House was\r\nalways simply a question of party; and no one had ever insisted more\r\nstrongly than Walpole himself that it must be a question of party.  The\r\nGovernment desired the Chippenham petition to succeed.  On some\r\ndisputed {190} point the Opposition prevailed over the Government by a\r\nmajority of one.  It is always said that Walpole then at once made up\r\nhis mind to resign; and that the knowledge of his intention put such\r\nheart into those who were falling away from him as to bring about the\r\nmarked increase which was presently to take place in the majority\r\nagainst him.  We are inclined to think that he even still hesitated,\r\nand that his hesitation caused the increase in the hostile majority.\r\nHe must go--he has to go--people said; and the sooner we make this\r\nclear to him the better.  Anyhow, the end was near.  The Chippenham\r\nelection was carried against him by a majority of sixteen--241 votes\r\nagainst 225.  A note at the bottom of the page of the Parliamentary\r\nDebates for that day says: \"The Chippenham election being thus carried\r\nin favor of the sitting members, it was reported that Sir Robert\r\nWalpole publicly declared he would never enter the House of Commons\r\nmore.\"  This was on February 2, 1742.  Next day the Lord Chancellor\r\nsignified the pleasure of the King that both Houses of Parliament\r\nshould adjourn until the eighteenth of the month.  Everybody knew what\r\nhad happened.  The long administration of twenty years was over; the\r\ngreat minister had fallen, never to lift his head again.  The\r\nParliamentary record thus tells us what had happened: \"The same evening\r\nthe Right Honorable Sir Robert Walpole resigned his place of First\r\nCommissioner of the Treasury and Chancellor and Under-Treasurer of the\r\nExchequer, which he had held ever since April 4, 1721, in the former of\r\nwhich he succeeded the Earl of Sunderland, and in the latter Mr.\r\nAislabie.\"\r\n\r\nThat, however, was not the deepest depth of the fall.  The same record\r\nannounces that \"three days afterwards his Majesty was pleased to create\r\nhim Earl of Orford, Viscount Walpole, and Baron of Houghton.\"\r\n\"Posterity,\" says Macaulay, \"has obstinately refused to degrade Francis\r\nBacon into Viscount St. Albans.\"  Posterity has in like manner\r\nobstinately refused to degrade Robert Walpole into the Earl of Orford.\r\nHe will be known {191} as Robert Walpole so long as English history\r\nitself is known.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1742--The new Administration]\r\n\r\nWalpole, then, was on the ground--down in the dust--never to rise\r\nagain.  Surely it would seem the close of his career as a\r\nPrime-minister must be the opening of that of his rival and conqueror.\r\nAny one now--supposing there could be some one entirely ignorant of\r\nwhat did really happen--would assume, as a matter of course, that\r\nPulteney would at once become Prime-minister and proceed to form an\r\nadministration.  This was naturally in Pulteney's power.  But Pulteney\r\nsuddenly remembered having said long ago that he would accept no\r\noffice, and he declared that he would positively hold to his word.  At\r\na moment of excitement, it would seem, and stung by some imputation of\r\nself-seeking, Pulteney had adopted the high Roman fashion, and\r\nannounced that he would prove his political disinterestedness by\r\nrefusing to accept any office in any administration.  The King\r\nconsulted Walpole during all these arrangements, and Walpole strongly\r\nrecommended him to offer the position of Prime-minister to Lord\r\nWilmington.  Time had come round indeed--this was the Sir Spencer\r\nCompton for whom King George at his accession had endeavored to thrust\r\naway Walpole, but whom Walpole had quietly thrust away.  He was an\r\nutterly incapable man.  Walpole probably thought that it would ruin the\r\nnew administration in the end if it were to have such a man as Compton,\r\nnow Lord Wilmington, at its head.  Lord Wilmington accepted the\r\nposition.  Lord Carteret had desired the post for himself, but Pulteney\r\nwould not hear of it.  The office of Secretary of State--of the\r\nSecretary of State who had to do with foreign affairs--was the proper\r\nplace, he insisted, for a man like Carteret.  The secretaries then\r\ndivided their functions into a Northern department and a Southern\r\ndepartment.  The Northern department was concerned with the charge of\r\nRussia, Prussia, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Poland, and Saxony;\r\nthe Southern department looked after France, Spain, Italy, Portugal,\r\nSwitzerland, Turkey, {192} and the States along the southern shore of\r\nthe Mediterranean.  So Carteret became one secretary, and the grotesque\r\nDuke of Newcastle remained the other.  The duke's brother, Henry\r\nPelham, remained in his place as Paymaster, Lord Hardwicke retained his\r\noffice as Lord Chancellor, and Mr. Samuel Sandys, who had moved the\r\nresolution calling for Walpole's dismissal, took Walpole's place as\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer.  There seems some humor in the appointment\r\nof such a man as successor to Robert Walpole.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1742--The combined four]\r\n\r\nThen Pulteney's career as a great Prime-minister is not beginning?\r\nNo--not beginning--never to begin.  By one of the strangest strokes of\r\nfate the events which closed the career of Walpole closed the career of\r\nPulteney too.  Yet but a few months, and Pulteney ceases as completely\r\nas Walpole has done to move the world of politics.  The battle is over\r\nand the rival leaders have both fallen.  One monument might suffice for\r\nboth, like that for Wolfe and Montcalm at Quebec.  Pulteney was offered\r\na peerage, an offer which he had contemptuously rejected twice before.\r\nHe accepted it now.  It will probably never be fully and certainly\r\nknown why he committed this act of political suicide.  Walpole appears\r\nto have been under the impression that it was by his cleverness the\r\nKing had been prevailed upon to drive Pulteney into the House of Lords.\r\nWalpole, indeed, very probably made the suggestion to the King, and no\r\ndoubt had as his sole motive in making it the desire to consign\r\nPulteney to obscurity; but it does not seem as if his was the influence\r\nwhich accomplished the object.  Lord Carteret and the Duke of Newcastle\r\nboth hated Pulteney, who as cordially hated them.  Newcastle was\r\njealous of Pulteney because of his immense influence in the House of\r\nCommons, which he fancied must be in some sort of way an injury to\r\nhimself and his brother; and, stupid as he was, he felt certain that if\r\nPulteney consented to enter the House of Lords the popularity and the\r\ninfluence would vanish.  Carteret's was a more reasonable if not a more\r\nnoble jealousy.  He was determined to come {193} to the head of affairs\r\nhimself--to be Prime-minister in fact if not in name; and he feared\r\nthat he never could be this so long as Pulteney remained, what some one\r\nhad called him, the Tribune of the Commons.  Once get him into the\r\nHouse of Lords and there was an end to the tribune and the tribune's\r\ncareer.  As for himself, Carteret, he would then be able to domineer\r\nover both Houses by his commanding knowledge of foreign affairs, now of\r\nsuch paramount importance to the State, and by his entire sympathy with\r\nthe views of the King.  The King hated Pulteney--had never forgiven him\r\nhis championship of the Prince of Wales--and would be delighted to see\r\nhim reduced to nothingness by a removal to the House of Lords.  But if\r\nit was plain alike to such men of intellect as Walpole and Carteret,\r\nand to such stupid men as King George and the Duke of Newcastle, that\r\nremoval to the House of Lords would mean political extinction for\r\nPulteney, how is it that no thought of the kind seems to have entered\r\ninto the mind of Pulteney himself?  Even as a question of the purest\r\npatriotism, such a man as Pulteney, believing his own policy to be for\r\nthe public good, ought to have sternly refused to allow himself to be\r\nforced into any position in which his public influence must be\r\ndiminished or destroyed.  As regarded his personal interests and his\r\nfame, Pulteney must have had every motive to induce him to remain in\r\nthe House where his eloquence and his debating power had won him such a\r\nplace.  It is impossible to believe that he could have been allured\r\njust then, at the height of his position and his renown, by the bauble\r\nof a coronet which he had twice before refused--contemptuously refused.\r\nProbably the real explanation may be found in the fact that Pulteney,\r\nfor all his fighting capacity, was not a strong but a weak man.\r\nProbably he was, like Goethe's Egmont, brilliant in battle but weak in\r\ncouncil.  All unknown to himself, four men, each man possessed of an\r\novermastering power of will, were combined against him for a single\r\npurpose--to drive him into the House of Lords--that is, to drive him\r\nout of the {194} House of Commons.  His enemies prevailed against him.\r\nAs Lord Chesterfield put it, he \"shrank into insignificance and an\r\nearldom.\"  We are far from saying that a man might not be a good\r\nminister and a statesman of influence after having accepted a seat in\r\nthe House of Lords.  But it was beginning to be found, even in\r\nPulteney's time, that the place of a great Prime-minister is in the\r\nHouse of Commons; and certainly the place of a tribune of the people\r\ncan hardly be the House of Lords.  Pulteney was born for the House of\r\nCommons: transplantation meant death to a genius like his.  When the\r\nnews of his \"promotion\" became public, a wild outcry of anger and\r\ndespair broke from his population of admirers.  He was denounced as\r\nhaving committed an act of perfidy and of treason.  He had accepted a\r\npeerage, it was said, as a bribe to induce him to consent to let Robert\r\nWalpole go unimpeached and unpunished.  The outcry was quite unjust,\r\nbut was certainly not unnatural.  People wanted some sort of\r\nexplanation of an act which no ordinary reasoning could possibly\r\nexplain.  Pulteney's conduct bitterly disappointed the Tory section of\r\nthe Opposition as well as the populace of his former adorers\r\nout-of-doors.  Bolingbroke, who had hurried back to England, found that\r\nall his dreams of a genuine Coalition Ministry, representing fairly\r\nboth wings of the forces of Opposition, had vanished with the morning\r\nlight.  Except for the removal of Walpole, hardly any change was made\r\nin the composition of recent English administration.  The Tories and\r\nJacobites, who had helped so signally in the fight, were left out of\r\nthe spoils of victory.  Bolingbroke found that he was no nearer to\r\npower than he would have been if Walpole still were at the head of\r\naffairs.  Nothing was changed for him; only a stupid man had taken the\r\nplace of a statesman.  Pulteney appears to have acted very generously\r\ntowards his immediate political colleagues, and to have remained in the\r\nHouse of Commons, where he now had all the power, until he had got for\r\nthem the places they desired.  Then he was gazetted as Earl of Bath;\r\nand we {195} have all heard the famous anecdote of the first meeting in\r\nthe House of Lords between the man who had been Robert Walpole and the\r\nman who had been William Pulteney, and the greeting given by the new\r\nLord Orford to the new Lord Bath;  \"Here we are, my lord, the two most\r\ninsignificant fellows in England.\"  With these words the first great\r\nleader of Opposition in the House of Commons, the man who may almost be\r\nsaid to have created the parliamentary part of leader of Opposition,\r\nmay be allowed to pass out of the political history of his time.\r\n\r\nMany attempts were made to impeach Walpole, as we still must call him.\r\nSecret committees of inquiry were moved for.  Horace Walpole, _the_\r\nHorace Walpole, Sir Robert's youngest son, made his first speech in the\r\nHouse of Commons, in defence of his father, against such a motion.  A\r\nsecret committee was at last obtained, but it did not succeed, although\r\ncomposed almost altogether of Walpole's enemies, in bringing out\r\nanything very startling against him.  Public money had been spent, no\r\ndoubt, here and there very freely for purely partisan work.  There\r\ncould be no question that some of it had gone in political corruption.\r\nBut everybody had already felt sure that this had been done by all\r\nministries and parties.  The report of the committee, when it came at\r\nlast, was received with cold indifference or unconcealed contempt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1742-1745--Death of Walpole]\r\n\r\nWalpole still kept a good deal in touch with the King.  George\r\nconsulted him privately, and indeed with much mystery about the\r\nconsultations.  The King sometimes sent a trusty messenger, who met\r\nWalpole at midnight at the house of a friend.  It was indeed a summons\r\nfrom George which hastened the great statesman's death.  The King\r\nwished to consult Walpole, and Walpole hurried up from Houghton for the\r\npurpose.  The journey greatly increased a malady from which he\r\nsuffered, and he was compelled by pain to have recourse to heavy doses\r\nof opium, which kept him insensible for the greater part of every day\r\nduring more than six weeks.  When the stupefying effect of the opium\r\nwas not on him--that is, for {196} some two or three hours each day--he\r\ntalked with all that former vivacity which of late years seemed to have\r\ndeserted him.  He knew that the end was coming, and he bore the\r\nknowledge with characteristic courage.  On March 18, 1745, he died at\r\nhis London house in Arlington Street.  Life could have had of late but\r\nlittle charm for him.  He had always lived for public affairs and for\r\npower.  He had none of the gifts of seclusion.  Except for his love of\r\npictures, he had no in-door intellectual resources.  He could not bury\r\nhimself in literature as Carteret could do; or, at a later day, Charles\r\nJames Fox; or, at a later day still, Mr. Gladstone.  Walpole's life\r\nreally came to an end the day he left the House of Commons; the rest\r\nwas silence.  He was only in his sixty-ninth year when he died.  It was\r\nfitting that he should lose his life in striving to assist and counsel\r\nthe sovereign whose family he more than any other man or set of men had\r\nseated firmly on the throne of England.  His faults were many; his\r\npersonal virtues perhaps but few.  One great and consummate public\r\nvirtue he certainly had: he was devoted to the interests of his\r\ncountry.  In the building of Nelson's ships it was said that the oak of\r\nHoughton Woods excelled all other timber.  Oak from the same woods was\r\nused to make musket-stocks for Wellington's soldiers in the long war\r\nagainst Napoleon.  Walpole's own fibre was something like that of the\r\noaks which grew on his domain.  His policy on two of the most eventful\r\noccasions of his life has been amply justified by history.  He was\r\nright in the principles of his Excise Bill; he was right in opposing\r\nthe war policy of the Patriots.  The very men who had leagued against\r\nhim in both these instances acknowledged afterwards that he was right\r\nand that they were wrong.  It was in an evil moment for himself that he\r\nyielded to the policy of the Patriots, and tried to carry on a war in\r\nwhich he had no sympathy, and from which he had no hope.  He was a\r\ngreat statesman; almost, but not quite, a great man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1744--Death of Pope]\r\n\r\nNot very long before Walpole's death a star of all but {197} the first\r\nmagnitude had set in the firmament of English literature.  Alexander\r\nPope died on May 30, 1744, at his house in Twickenham, where \"Thames'\r\ntranslucent wave shines a broad mirror,\" to use his own famous words.\r\nHe died quietly; death was indeed a relief to him from pain which he\r\nhad borne with a patience hardly to be expected from one of so fitful a\r\ntemper.  Pope's life had been all a struggle against ill-health and\r\npremature decrepitude.  He was deformed; he was dwarfish; he was\r\nmiserably weak from his very boyhood; a rude breath of air made him\r\nshrink and wither; the very breezes of summer had peril in them for his\r\nsingularly delicate constitution and ever-quivering nerves.  He was but\r\nfifty-six years old when death set him free.  Life had been for him a\r\nsplendid success indeed, but the success had been qualified by much\r\nbitterness and pain.  He was sensitive to the quick; he formed strong\r\nfriendships, fierce and passionate enmities; and the friendships\r\nthemselves turned only too often into enmities.  Unsparing with the\r\nsatire of his pen, he made enemies everywhere.  He professed to be\r\nindifferent to the world's praise or censure, but he was nevertheless\r\nmorbidly anxious to know what people said of him.  He was as egotistic\r\nas Rousseau or Byron; but he had none of Byron's manly public spirit,\r\nand none of Rousseau's exalted love of humanity.  Pope's place in\r\nEnglish poetry may be taken now as settled.  He stands high and stands\r\nfirmly in the second class: that is, in the class just below\r\nShakespeare and Milton and a very few others.  He has been\r\nextravagantly censured and extravagantly praised.  Byron at one time\r\nmaintained that he was the greatest English poet, and many vehement\r\narguments have been used to prove that he was not a poet at all.  One\r\nEnglish critic believed he had settled the question forever when he\r\ndescribed Pope as \"a musical rocking-horse.\"  Again and again the world\r\nhas been told that Pope has disappeared from the sky of literature, but\r\nthe world looks up, and behold, there is the star shining just as\r\nbefore.  Many scholars and many poets have scoffed at his translations\r\nof {198} Homer, but generations of English school-boys have learned to\r\nlove the \"Iliad\" because of the way in which Pope has told them the\r\nstory; and as to the telling of a story, the judgment of a school-boy\r\nsometimes counts for more than the judgment of a sage.  Pope's \"Iliad\"\r\nand \"Odyssey\" are certainly not for those who can read the great\r\noriginals in their own tongue, or even for those who have a taste\r\nstrong and refined enough to enjoy the severe fidelity of a prose\r\ntranslation.  But Pope has brought the story of Achilles' wrath, and\r\nHelen's pathetic beauty, and Hector's fall, and Priam's agony home to\r\nthe hearts of millions for whom they would otherwise have no life.  We\r\nhave no intention of writing a critical dissertation on the poetry of\r\nPope.  One fact may, however, be remarked and recorded concerning it.\r\nAfter Shakespeare, and possibly Milton, no English poet is so much\r\nquoted from as Pope.  Lines and phrases of his have passed into the\r\ncommon vernacular of our daily life.  We talk Pope, many of us, as the\r\ntoo-often cited _bourgeois gentilhomme_ of Molière talked prose,\r\nwithout knowing it.  There is hardly a line of \"The Rape of the Lock\"\r\nor \"The Dunciad\" that has not thus passed into the habitual\r\nconversation of our lives.  This of itself would not prove that Pope\r\nwas a great poet, but it is a striking testimony to his extraordinary\r\npopularity, and his style is not that which of itself would seem\r\ncalculated to insure popularity.  The very smoothness and perfection of\r\nhis verse make it seem to many ears nothing better than a melodious\r\nmonotony.  Pope had not imagination enough to be a great poet of the\r\nhighest order--the order of creative power.  He had marvellous fancy,\r\nwhich sometimes, as in \"The Rape of the Lock\" and in passages of the\r\nfierce \"Dunciad,\" rose to something like imagination.  Every good\r\nChristian ought no doubt to lament that a man of such noble gifts\r\nshould have had also such a terrible gift of hate.  But even a very\r\ngood Christian could hardly help admitting that it must have been all\r\nfor the best, seeing that only for that passion of hatred we should\r\nnever have had \"The Dunciad.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{199}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\n\"THE FORTY-FIVE.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1720--Birth of \"Prince Charlie\"]\r\n\r\nThirty years had come and gone since England had been alarmed,\r\nirritated, or encouraged, according to the temper of its political\r\ninhabitants, by a Jacobite rising.  The personality of James Stuart,\r\nthe Old Pretender, was little more than a memory among those clansmen\r\nwho had rallied round the royal standard at Braemar.  In those thirty\r\nyears James Stuart had lived his melancholy, lonely, evil life of\r\nexile, the hanger-on of foreign courts, the half grotesque, half\r\npitiable, sham monarch of a sham court, that was always ready to be\r\nmoved from place to place, with all its cheaply regal accessaries, like\r\nthe company and the properties of some band of strolling players.  Now\r\nthere was a new Stuart in the field, a new sham prince, a \"Young\r\nPretender.\"  After the disasters of the Fifteen, James Stuart had\r\nbecome the hero of as romantic a love-story as ever wandering prince\r\nexperienced.  He had fallen in love, in the hot, unreasoning Stuart\r\nway, with the beautiful Clementine Sobieski, and the beautiful\r\nClementine had returned the passion of the picturesquely unfortunate\r\nprince, and they had carried on their love affairs under conditions of\r\ngreater difficulty than Romeo and Juliet, and had overcome the\r\ndifficulties and got married, and in 1720 Clementine had borne to the\r\nHouse of Stuart a son and heir.  Every precaution was taken to insure\r\nthe most public recognition of the existence of the newly born prince.\r\nIt was determined that none of the perplexity, the uncertainty, the\r\nsuspicion, which attended upon the birth of James, should be permitted\r\nto arise now.  There must be no _haro_ about warming-pans, no\r\naccusations of {200} juggling, no possible doubts as to the right of\r\nthe new-born babe to be regarded as the son of James Stuart and of\r\nClementine Sobieski.  The birth took place in Rome, and cardinals\r\naccredited from all the great Powers of Europe were present on the\r\noccasion to bear witness to it.  The city was alive with such\r\nexcitement as it had seldom witnessed since the days when pagan Rome\r\nbecame papal Rome.  The streets in the vicinity of the house where\r\nClementine Sobieski lay in her pain were choked with the gilt carriages\r\nof the proudest Italian nobility; princes of the Church and princes of\r\nroyal blood thronged the antechambers.  Gallant gentlemen who bore some\r\nof the stateliest names of England and of Scotland waited on the\r\nstair-ways for the tidings that a new prince was given unto their\r\nloyalty.  Adventurous soldiers of fortune kicked their heels in the\r\ncourt-yard, and thought with moistened eyes of the toasts they would\r\ndrink to their future king.  From the Castle of St. Angelo, where long\r\nago the besieged had hurled upon the besiegers the statues that had\r\nproved the taste of a Roman emperor, where Rienzi lay yesterday, and\r\nwhere Cagliostro shall lie to-morrow, thunders of artillery saluted the\r\nadvent of the new rose of the House of Stuart.\r\n\r\nIn the years that followed, while the young Prince Charles was growing\r\nup to his tragic inheritance, it can hardly be maintained, even by the\r\nmost devoted adherent of the Stuart line, that James showed himself in\r\nthe slightest degree worthy of the crown towards which he reached.\r\nIndeed, his conduct showed a reckless indifference to the means most\r\nlikely to attain that crown which it is difficult to account for.  When\r\neverything depended for the success of his schemes upon the friends he\r\nmade abroad and the favor he retained at home, he wantonly acted as if\r\nhis dearest purpose was to alienate the one and to wholly lose the\r\nother.  His conduct towards his wife, and his persistent and stupid\r\nfavoritism of the Mar man and woman--especially the woman--drove the\r\ninjured and indignant Clementine into a convent, and made the great\r\nEuropean {201} princes of Spain, Germany, and Rome his adversaries.\r\nSpain refused him entrance to the kingdom unaccompanied by his wife;\r\nthe Pope struck him a heavier blow in diminishing by one-half the\r\nincome that had hitherto been allowed him from the Papal treasury.  But\r\nworse than the loss of foreign friends, worse even than the loss of the\r\nSistine subsidy, was the effect which his treatment of his wife\r\nproduced in the countries which he aspired to rule.  His wisest\r\nfollowers wrote to him that he had done more to injure his cause by his\r\nconduct to Clementine than by anything else in his ill-advised career.\r\nAt last even James took alarm; his stubborn nature was forced to yield;\r\nthe obnoxious favorites were dismissed, and a reconciliation of a kind\r\nwas effected between the Stuart king and queen.  But fidelity was a\r\nquality difficult enough for James to practise, and when the Queen died\r\nin 1735 it is said that she found death not unwelcome.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1734-1735--Charles in his first campaign]\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the young Prince Charles grew up to early manhood.\r\nPrinces naturally begin the world at an earlier age than most men, and\r\nCharles may be said to have begun the world in 1734, when, as we have\r\nseen, at the age of fourteen, he took part in the siege of Gaeta as a\r\ngeneral of artillery, and bore himself, according to overwhelming\r\ntestimony, as became a soldier.  Up to this time his education had been\r\npursued with something like regularity; and if at all times he\r\npreferred rowing, riding, hunting, and shooting to graver and more\r\nsecluded pleasures, he was not in this respect peculiar among young\r\nmen, princes or otherwise.  If, too, he never succeeded in overcoming\r\nthe difficulties which the spelling of the English language presented,\r\nand if his handwriting always remained slovenly and illegible, it must\r\nbe remembered that in that age spelling was not prized as a pre-eminent\r\naccomplishment by exalted persons, and that Charles Stuart could spell\r\nquite as well as Marlborough.  He knew how to sign his name; and it may\r\nbe remarked that though he has passed into the pages of history and the\r\npages of romance as Charles Edward, he himself never signed his {202}\r\nname so, but always simply Charles.  He was baptized Charles Edward\r\nLouis Philip Casimir, and, like his ancestors before him, he chose his\r\nfirst name as his passport through the world.  If he had marched to\r\nFinchley, if Culloden had gone otherwise than it did go, if any of the\r\nmany things that might have happened in his favor had come to pass, he\r\nwould have been Charles the Third of England.\r\n\r\nHis education was, from a religious point of view, curiously mixed.  He\r\nwas intrusted to the especial care of Murray, Mrs. Hay's brother, and a\r\nProtestant, much to the grief and anger of his mother.  But he\r\nprofessed the tenets of the Catholic Church, and satisfied Pope\r\nClement, in an interview when the young prince was only thirteen, that\r\nhis Catholic education was sound and complete.  For the rest, he was a\r\ngraceful musician, spoke French, Spanish, and Italian as readily as\r\nEnglish, and was skilled in the use of arms.  As far as the cultivation\r\nof mind or body vent, he might fairly be considered to hold his own\r\nwith any of the preceding sovereigns and princes of the House of\r\nStuart.  When in 1737 he set out on a kind of triumphal tour of the\r\ngreat Italian towns, he was received everywhere with enthusiasm, and\r\neverywhere made the most favorable impression.  So successful was this\r\nperformance, so popular did the prince make himself, and so warmly was\r\nhe received, that the Hanoverian Government took upon itself to be\r\nseriously offended, ordered the Venetian ambassador Businiello to leave\r\nLondon, and conveyed to the Republic of Genoa its grave disapproval of\r\nthe Republic's conduct.  The zealous energy of Mr. Fane, our envoy at\r\nFlorence, saved that duchy from a like rebuke.  Mr. Fane insisted so\r\nstrongly that no kind of State reception was to be accorded to the\r\ntravelling prince that the Grand Duke gave way.  Yet the Grand Duke's\r\ncuriosity to meet Charles Stuart was so great that he had prevailed\r\nupon Fane to allow him to meet the stranger on the footing of a private\r\nindividual; but sudden death carried off the poor Grand Duke before the\r\ninterview could take place.\r\n\r\n{203}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1734-1737--The omen accepted]\r\n\r\nWhen Charles Stuart, as a general of fourteen, was helping to besiege\r\nGaeta, he had been hailed by Don Carlos as Prince of Wales, and as\r\nPrince of Wales he was invariably addressed by those outside the little\r\ncircle of the sham court who wished to please the exiled princes or\r\nshow their sympathy with their cause.  The young Charles soon began to\r\nweary of being Prince of Wales only in name.  It seems certain that\r\nfrom a very early age his thoughts were turned to England and the\r\nEnglish succession.  There is a legend that at Naples once the young\r\nprince's hat blew into the sea, and when some of his companions wished\r\nto put forth in a boat and fetch it back he dissuaded them, saying that\r\nit was not worth while, as he would have to go shortly to England to\r\nfetch his hat.  The legend is in all likelihood true in so far as it\r\nrepresents the bent of the young man's mind.  He was sufficiently\r\nintelligent to perceive that masquerading through Italian cities and\r\nthe reception of pseudo-royal honors from petty princes were but a poor\r\ncounterfeit of the honors that were his, as he deemed, by right divine.\r\nSo it was only natural that with waxing manhood his eyes and his\r\nthoughts turned more often to that England which he had never seen, but\r\nwhich, as he had been so often and often assured, was only waiting for\r\na fit opportunity to cast off the Hanoverian yoke and welcome any\r\nlineal descendant of the Charleses and the Jameses of beloved memory.\r\n\r\nMore than one expedition had been planned, and one expedition had\r\ndecisively failed, when in the summer of 1745 Prince Charles sailed\r\nfrom Belleisle on board the _Boutelle_, with the _Elizabeth_ as a\r\ncompanion vessel.  He started on this expedition on his own\r\nresponsibility and at his own risk.  Murray of Broughton, and other\r\ninfluential Scottish friends, had told him, again and again, that it\r\nwould be absolutely useless to come to Scotland without a substantial\r\nand well-armed following of at least six thousand troops, and a\r\nsubstantial sum of money in his pocket.  To ask so much was to ask the\r\nimpossible.  {204} At one time the young prince had believed that Louis\r\nthe Fifteenth would find him the men and lend him the money, but in\r\n1745 any such hope had entirely left him.  He knew now that Louis the\r\nFifteenth would do nothing for him; he knew that if he was ever to\r\nregain his birthright he must win it with his own wits.  It is\r\nimpossible not to admire the desperate courage of the young aspirant\r\nsetting out thus lightly to conquer a kingdom with only a handful of\r\nmen at his back and hardly a handful of money in his pocket.  Judging,\r\ntoo, by the course of events and the near approach which the prince\r\nmade to success, it is impossible not to accord him considerable praise\r\nfor that instinct which makes the great soldier and the great\r\nstatesman, the instinct which counsels when to dare.  The very ships in\r\nwhich he was sailing he had got hold of, not only without the\r\nconnivance, but without the knowledge, of the French Government.  They\r\nwere obtained through two English residents at Nantes.  On August 2d\r\nthe _Boutelle_ anchored off the Hebrides alone.  The _Elizabeth_ had\r\nfallen in with an English vessel, the _Lion_, and had been so severely\r\nhandled that she was obliged to return to Brest to refit, carrying with\r\nher all the arms and ammunition on which Prince Charles had relied for\r\nthe furtherance of his expedition.  So here was the claimant to the\r\ncrown, friendless and alone, trying his best to derive encouragement\r\nfrom the augury which Tullibardine grandiloquently discerned in the\r\nflight of a royal eagle around the vessel.  Eagle or no eagle, augury\r\nor no augury, the opening of the campaign was gloomy in the extreme.\r\nThe first clansmen whose aid the prince solicited were indifferent,\r\nreluctant, and obstinate in their indifference and reluctance.\r\nMacdonald of Boisdale first, and Clanranald of that ilk afterwards,\r\nassured the prince, with little ceremony, that without aid, and\r\nsubstantial aid, from a foreign Power, in the shape of arms and\r\nfighting-men, no clansman would bare claymore in his behalf.  But the\r\neloquence and the determination of the young prince won over Clanranald\r\nand the Macdonalds of {205} Kinloch-Moidart; Charles disembarked and\r\ntook up his headquarters at Borrodaile farm in Inverness-shire.  A kind\r\nof legendary fame attaches to the little handful of men who formed his\r\nimmediate following.  [Sidenote: 1745--The Seven Men of Moidart] The\r\nSeven Men of Moidart are as familiar in Scottish Jacobite legend as the\r\nSeven Champions of Christendom are to childhood.  Tullibardine; Sir\r\nThomas Sheridan, the prince's tutor; Francis Strickland, an English\r\ngentleman; Sir John Macdonald, an officer in the service of Spain;\r\nKelly, a non-juring clergyman; Buchanan, the messenger, and Aeneas\r\nMacdonald, the banker, made up the mystic tale.  Among these Seven Men\r\nof Moidart, Aeneas Macdonald plays the traitor's part that Ganelon\r\nplays in the legends of Charlemagne.  He seems to have been actuated,\r\nfrom the moment that the prince landed on the Scottish shore, by the\r\none desire to bring his own head safely out of the scrape, and to\r\nattain that end he seems to have been ready to do pretty well anything.\r\nWhen he was finally taken prisoner he saved himself by the readiness\r\nand completeness with which he gave his evidence.  No more of him.\r\nThere were, happily for the honor of the adherents of the House of\r\nStuart, few such followers in the Forty-five.\r\n\r\nThe position of the young prince was peculiar.  His engaging manners\r\nhad won over many of the chiefs; his presence had set on fire that old\r\nStuart madness which a touch can often kindle in wild Highland hearts;\r\nhis determination to be a Scotchman among Scotchmen, a determination\r\nwhich set him the desperate task of trying to master the Gaelic speech,\r\ninsured his hold upon the affections of the rude chivalry whom his\r\npresence and his name had already charmed.  But some of the greatest\r\nclans absolutely refused to come in.  Macdonald of Sleat, and Macleod\r\nof Macleod, would have none of the \"pretended Prince of Wales\" and his\r\n\"madmen.\"\r\n\r\nThough these chieftains were appealed to again and again, they were\r\nresolute in their refusal to embark in the Stuart cause.  They pledged\r\nthemselves to the House of Hanover, they accepted commissions in the\r\nroyal army; {206} the cause of Charles Stuart must sink or swim without\r\nthem.  With them or without them, however, Charles was going on.  The\r\nnumber of clans that had come in was quite sufficient to fill him with\r\nhope; the little brush at Spean's Bridge between two companies of the\r\nScots Royal, under Captain Scott, and the clansmen of Keppoch and\r\nLochiel, had given the victory to the rebels.  The Stuarts had drawn\r\nfirst blood successfully, and the superstitions saw in the circumstance\r\nyet another augury of success.  The time was now ripe for action.  All\r\nover the north of Scotland the Proclamation of Prince Charles was\r\nscattered.  This proclamation called upon all persons to recognize\r\ntheir rightful sovereign in the young prince's person as regent for his\r\nfather, invited all soldiers of King George, by offers of increased\r\nrank or increased pay, to desert to the Stuart colors, promised a free\r\npardon and full religious liberty to all who should renounce their\r\nallegiance to the usurper, and threatened all who, after due warning,\r\nremained obdurate with grave pains and penalties.  Everywhere through\r\nthe west this document had been seen and studied, had inflamed men's\r\nminds, and set men's pulses dancing to old Jacobite tunes.  In\r\nEdinburgh, in Berwick, in Carlisle, copies had been seen by astonished\r\nadherents of the House of Stuart, who were delighted or dismayed,\r\naccording to their temperaments.  Scotland was pretty well aware of the\r\npresence of the young prince by the time that it was resolved to unfurl\r\nthe flag.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1745--An auspicious opening]\r\n\r\nThe royal standard of crimson and white was raised by Tullibardine on\r\nAugust 19th in the vale of Glenfinnan, in the presence of Keppoch and\r\nLochiel, Macdonald of Glencoe, Stuart of Appin, and Stuart of Ardshiel,\r\nand their clansmen.  No such inauspicious omen occurred as that which\r\nshook the nerves of the superstitious when James Stuart gave his banner\r\nto the winds of Braemar a generation earlier.  Indeed, an invading\r\nprince could hardly wish for happier conditions under which to begin\r\nhis enterprise.  Not only was he surrounded by faithful clansmen,\r\nprepared to do or die for the heir to the House of Stuart, but the\r\n{207} stately ceremony of setting up the royal standard was witnessed\r\nby English prisoners, the servants and the soldiers of King George, the\r\nfirst-fruits of the hoped-for triumph over the House of Hanover.  \"Go,\r\nsir,\" Charles is reported to have said to one of his prisoners, Captain\r\nSwetenham, \"go and tell your general that Charles Stuart is coming to\r\ngive him battle.\"  That clement of the theatrical which has always hung\r\nabout the Stuart cause, and which has in so large a degree given it its\r\nabiding charm, was here amply present.  For a royal adventurer setting\r\nout on a crusade for a kingdom the opening chapter of the enterprise\r\nwas undoubtedly auspicious reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{208}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nTHE MARCH SOUTH.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1715-1716--The chances in his favor]\r\n\r\nThe condition of Scotland at the time of the prince's landing was such\r\nas in a great degree to favor a hostile invasion.  Even educated\r\nEnglishmen then knew much less about Scotland, or at least the\r\nHighlands of Scotland, than their descendants do to-day of Central\r\nAfrica.  People--the few daringly adventurous people--who ventured to\r\ntravel in the Highlands were looked upon by their admiring friends as\r\nthe rivals of Bruce or Mandoville, and they wrote books about their\r\ntravels as they would have done if they had travelled in Thibet; and\r\nvery curious reading those books are now after the lapse of something\r\nover a century.  The whole of the Highlands were wild, unfrequented,\r\nand desolate, under the rude jurisdiction of the heads of the great\r\nHighland houses, whose clansmen, as savage and as desperately\r\ncourageous as Sioux or Pawnees, offered their lords an almost\r\nidolatrous devotion.  Nominally the clans were under the authority of\r\nthe English Crown and the Scottish law; actually they recognized no\r\nrule but the rule of their chiefs, who wielded a power as despotic as\r\nthat of any feudal seigneur in the days of the old régime.  The heroes\r\nof the Ossianic poems--the Finns and Dermats whom colonization had\r\ntransplanted from Irish to Scottish legend--were not more unfettered or\r\nmore antiquely chivalrous than the clansmen who boasted of their\r\ndescent from them.  Scotland was more unlike England in the middle of\r\nthe last century than Russia is unlike Sicily to day.\r\n\r\nThere were several things in Charles's favor.  To begin with, the\r\ndisarmament of the clans, which had been insisted {209} upon after \"the\r\nFifteen,\" had been carried out in such a fashion as was now to prove\r\nmost serviceable to the Young Pretender; for the only clans that had\r\nbeen really disarmed were the Mackays, Campbells, and Sutherlands, who\r\nwere loyal enough to the House of Hanover, and gave up their weapons\r\nvery readily to prove their loyalty.  But the other clans--the clans\r\nthat ever cherished the lingering hope of a Stuart restoration--were\r\nnot in reality disarmed at all.  They made a great show of surrendering\r\nto General Wade weapons that were utterly worthless as weapons of war,\r\nhoney-combed, crippled old guns and swords and axes; but the good guns\r\nand swords and axes, the serviceable weapons, these were all carefully\r\nstowed away in fitting places of concealment, ready for the hour when\r\nthey might be wanted again.  That hour had now come.  So that, thanks\r\nto the Disarming Act of 1716, the Government found its chief allies in\r\nthe north of Scotland practically defenceless and unarmed, while the\r\nclans that kept pouring in to rally around the standard of the young\r\ninvader were as well armed as any of those who had fought so stoutly at\r\nSheriffmuir.  Yet another advantage on the adventurer's side was due to\r\nthe tardiness with which news travelled in those times.  Charles had\r\nbeen for many days in the Highlands, preparing the way for the rising,\r\nbefore rumors of anything like an accredited kind came to the Court of\r\nSt. James.  The Highlands and islands of Scotland were then so far\r\nremoved from the great world of government that it had taken something\r\nlike half a year on one occasion before the dwellers in the stormy\r\nShetlands had learned that their sovereign, King William the Third, was\r\ndead and buried; and in the years that had elapsed since William of\r\nOrange passed away the means of communication between London and the\r\nfar north were little if at all better.  Charles had actually raised\r\nhis standard and rallied clan after clan around him before the\r\nGovernment in London could seriously believe that a Stuart in arms was\r\nin the island.  There were other and minor elements of success, too, to\r\nbe noted in the great game that the Stuart prince {210} was playing.\r\nThe Ministry was unpopular: the head of that Ministry was the imbecile\r\nDuke of Newcastle, perhaps the most contemptible statesman who has ever\r\nmade high office ridiculous.  The King was away in Hanover.  England\r\nwas in the toils of a foreign war, and her prestige had lately suffered\r\nheavily from the sudden defeat at Fontenoy.  There were very few troops\r\nin England to employ against an invasion, and the Scottish\r\ncommander-in-chief, Sir John Cope, whose name lives in unenviable fame\r\nin the burden of many a Jacobite ballad, was as incapable a\r\nwell-meaning general as ever was called upon to face a great unexpected\r\nemergency.  It must be admitted that all these were excellent points in\r\nthe prince's favor, and that they counted for much in the conduct of\r\nthe campaign.\r\n\r\nFrom the first, young Charles Stuart might well have come to regard\r\nhimself as the favorite of fortune.  The history of the Forty-five\r\ndivides itself into two distinct parts: the first a triumphant record\r\nof brilliant victories, and the picture of a young prince marching\r\nthrough conquest after conquest to a crown; the second part prefaced by\r\na disastrous resolution, leading to overwhelming defeat, and ending in\r\nignominious flight and the extinction of the last Stuart hope.  From\r\nthe moment when the Stuart standard fluttered its folds of white and\r\ncrimson on the Highland wind it seemed as if the Stuart luck had\r\nturned.  Charles might well conceive himself happy.  Upon his sword sat\r\nlaurel victory.  Smooth success was strewn before his feet.  The\r\nblundering and bewildered Cope actually allowed Charles and his army to\r\nget past him.  Cope was neither a coward nor a traitor, but he was a\r\nterrible blunderer, and while the English general was marching upon\r\nInverness Charles was triumphantly entering Perth.  From Perth the\r\nyoung prince, with hopeless, helpless Cope still in his rear, marched\r\non Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1745--The advance of the clans]\r\n\r\nThe condition of Edinburgh was peculiar: although a large proportion of\r\nits inhabitants, especially those who were well-to-do, were stanch\r\nsupporters of the House of Hanover, there were plenty of Jacobites in\r\nthe place, and {211} it only needed the favor of a few victories to\r\nbring into open day a great deal of latent Jacobitism that was for the\r\nmoment prudently kept under by its possessors.  The Lord Provost\r\nhimself was more than suspected of being a Jacobite at heart.  The city\r\nwas miserably defended.  Such walls as it possessed were more\r\nornamental than useful, and in any case were sadly in want of repair.\r\nAll the military force it could muster to meet the advance of the clans\r\nwas the small but fairly efficient body of men who formed the Town\r\nGuard; the Train Bands, some thousand strong, who knew no more than so\r\nmany spinsters of the division of a battle; the small and undisciplined\r\nEdinburgh regiment; and a scratch collection of volunteers hurriedly\r\nraked together from among the humbler citizens of the town, and about\r\nas useful as so many puppets to oppose to the daring and the ferocity\r\nof the clans.  Edinburgh opinion had changed very rapidly with regard\r\nto that same daring and ferocity.  When the first rumors of the\r\nprince's advance were bruited abroad, the adherents of the House of\r\nHanover in Edinburgh made very merry over the gang of ragged rascals,\r\nhen-roost robbers, and drunken rogues upon whom the Pretender relied in\r\nhis effort to \"enjoy his ain again.\"  But as the clans came nearer and\r\nnearer, as the air grew thicker with flying rumors of the successes\r\nthat attended upon the prince's progress, as the capacity of the town\r\nseemed weaker for holding out, and as the prospect of reinforcements\r\nseemed to grow fainter and fainter, the opinion of Hanoverian Edinburgh\r\nconcerning the clans changed mightily.  Had the Highlanders been a race\r\nof giants, endowed with more than mortal prowess, and invulnerable as\r\nAchilles, they could hardly have struck more terror into the hearts of\r\nloyal and respectable Edinburgh citizens.\r\n\r\nStill there were some stout hearts in Edinburgh who did their best to\r\nkeep up the courage of the rest and to keep out the enemy.  Andrew\r\nFletcher and Duncan Forbes were of the number.  M'Laurin, the\r\nmathematician, turned his genius to the bettering of the\r\nfortifications.  Old {212} Dr. Stevenson, bedridden but heroic, kept\r\nguard in his armchair for many days at the Netherbow Gate.  The great\r\nquestion was would Cope come in time?  Cope was at Aberdeen.  Cope had\r\nput his army upon transports.  Cope might be here to-morrow, the day\r\nafter to-morrow, to-day, who knows?  But in the mean time the King's\r\nDragoons, whom Cope had left behind him when he first started out to\r\nmeet the Pretender, had steadily and persistently retreated before the\r\nHighland advance.  They had now halted--they can hardly be said to have\r\nmade a stand--at Corstorphine, some three miles from Edinburgh, and\r\nhere it was resolved to do something to stay the tide of invasion.\r\nHamilton's Dragoons were at Leith.  These were ordered to join the\r\nKing's Dragoons at Corstorphine, and to collect as many Edinburgh\r\nvolunteers as they could on their way.  Inside the walls of Edinburgh\r\nit was easy enough to collect volunteers, and quite a little army of\r\nthem marched out with drums beating and colors flying at the heels of\r\nHamilton's Dragoons.  But on the way to the town gates the temper of\r\nthe volunteers changed, and by the time that the town gates were\r\nreached and passed the volunteers had dwindled to so pitiable a handful\r\nthat they were dismissed, and Hamilton's Dragoons proceeded alone to\r\njoin Cope's King's Dragoons at Corstorphine.\r\n\r\nBut the united force of dragoons did not stay long at Corstorphine.\r\nThe fame of the fierce Highlanders had unhinged their valor, and it\r\nonly needed a few of the prince's supporters to ride within pistol-shot\r\nand discharge their pieces at the Royal troops to set them into as\r\ndisgraceful a panic as ever animated frightened men.  The dragoons,\r\nludicrously unmanned, turned tail and rode for their lives, rode\r\nwithout drawing bridle and without staying spur till they came to\r\nLeith, paused there for a little, and then, on some vague hint that the\r\nHighlanders were on their track, they were in the saddle again and\r\nriding for their lives once more.  Dismayed Edinburgh citizens saw them\r\nsweep along what now is Prince's Street, a pitiable sight; saw them,\r\nbloody with spurring, fiery hot with {213} haste, ride on--on into the\r\ndarkness.  On and on the desperate cowards scampered, sheep-like in\r\ntheir shameful fear, till they reached Dunbar and behind its gates\r\nallowed themselves to breathe more freely, and to congratulate\r\nthemselves upon the dangers they had escaped.  Such is the story of the\r\nfamous, or infamous, \"Cantor of Coltbrigg,\" one of the most disgraceful\r\nrecords of the abject collapse of regular troops before the terror of\r\nan almost unseen foe that are to found in history.  Well might loyal\r\nEdinburgh despair if such were its best defenders.  The town was all\r\ntumult, the Loyalists were in utter gloom, the secretly exulting\r\nJacobites were urging the impossibility of resistance, and the\r\nnecessity for yielding while yielding was still an open question.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1745--Edinburgh parleys]\r\n\r\nOn the top of all this came a summons from the prince demanding the\r\nimmediate surrender of the city.  A deputation was at once despatched\r\nto Gray's Mill, where the prince had halted, to confer with him.\r\nScarcely had the deputation gone when rumor spread abroad in the town\r\nthat Cope, Cope the long expected, the almost given up, was actually\r\nclose at hand, and the weathercock emotions of the town veered to a new\r\nquarter.  Perhaps they might be able to hold out after all.  The great\r\nthing was to gain time.  The deputation came back to say that Prince\r\nCharles must have a distinct answer to his summons before two o'clock\r\nin the morning, and it was now ten at night.  Still spurred by the hope\r\nof gaining time, and allowing Cope to arrive, if, indeed, he were\r\narriving, the deputation was sent back again.  But the prince refused\r\nto see them, and the deputation returned to the city, and all\r\nunconsciously decided the fate of Edinburgh.  Lochiel and Murray, with\r\nsome five hundred Camerons, had crept close to the walls under the\r\ncover of the darkness of the night, in the hope of finding some means\r\nof surprising the city.  Hidden close by the Netherbow Port, they saw\r\nthe coach which had carried the deputation home drive up and demand\r\nadmittance.  The admittance, which was readily granted to the coach,\r\ncould not well be refused to the {214}\r\n\r\nHighlanders, who leaped up the moment the doors were opened,\r\noverpowered the guard, and entered the town.  Edinburgh awoke in the\r\nmorning to find its doubts at an end.  It was in the hands of the\r\nHighlanders.\r\n\r\nJacobite Edinburgh went wild with delight over its hero prince.  He\r\nentered Holyrood with the white rose in his bonnet and the star of\r\nSaint Andrew on his breast, through enthusiastic crowds that fought\r\neagerly for a nearer sight of his face or the privilege of touching his\r\nhand.  The young prince looked his best; the hereditary melancholy\r\nwhich cast its shadow over the faces of all the Stuarts was for the\r\nmoment dissipated.  Flushed with easy triumph, popular applause, and\r\ngrowing hope, the young prince entered the palace of his ancestors like\r\na king returning to his own.  James Hepburn of Keith, with drawn sword,\r\nled the way; beautiful women distributed white cockades to enraptured\r\nJacobites; the stateliest chivalry of Scotland made obeisance to its\r\nrightful prince.  The intoxicating day ended with a great ball at the\r\npalace, at which the youthful grace of Charles Stuart confirmed the\r\ncharm that already belonged to the adventurous and victorious Prince of\r\nWales.  September 17, 1745, was one of the brightest days in the Stuart\r\ncalendar.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of Edinburgh was but the prelude to greater glories.  Cope\r\nwas rallying his forces at Dunbar--was marching to the relief of\r\nEdinburgh.  Charles, acting on the advice of his generals, marched out\r\nto meet him.  Cope's capacity for blundering was by no means exhausted.\r\nHe affected a contemptuous disregard for his foes, delayed attack in\r\ndefiance of the advice of his wisest generals, was taken unawares in\r\nthe gray morning of the 21st at Prestonpans, and routed completely and\r\nignominiously in five minutes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1745--Bore the news of his own defeat]\r\n\r\nSeldom has it been the misfortune of an English general to experience\r\nso thorough, so humiliating a defeat.  The wild charges of the Highland\r\nmen broke up the ordered ranks of the English troops in hopeless\r\nconfusion; almost all the infantry was cut to pieces, and the cavalry\r\n{215} escaped only by desperate flight.  Cope's dragoons were\r\naccustomed to flight by this time; the clatter of their horses' hoofs\r\nas they cantered from Coltbrigg was still in their cars, and as they\r\nonce again tore in shameless flight up the Edinburgh High Street they\r\nmight well have reflected upon the rapidity with which such experiences\r\nrepeated themselves.  General Preston of the Castle refused to admit\r\nthe cowards within his gate, so there was nothing for them but to turn\r\ntheir horses' heads again and spur off into the west country.  As for\r\nCope, he managed to collect some ragged remnant of his ruined army\r\nabout him, and to make off with all speed to Berwick, where he was\r\nreceived by Lord Mark Ker with the scornful assurance that he was the\r\nfirst commander-in-chief in Europe who had brought with him the news of\r\nhis own defeat.\r\n\r\nThe victorious army were unable, if they had wished, to follow up the\r\nflight, owing to their lack of cavalry.  They remained on the field to\r\nascertain their own losses and to count their spoil.  The losses were\r\ntrifling, the gain was great.  Only thirty Highlanders were killed,\r\nonly seventy wounded, in that astonishing battle.  As for the gain, not\r\nmerely were the honorable trophies of victory, the colors and the\r\nstandards, left in the Highland hands, but the artillery and the\r\nsupplies, with some two thousand pounds in money, offered the prince's\r\ntroops a solid reward for their daring.  It is to the credit of Charles\r\nthat after the fury of attack was over he insisted upon the wounded\r\nenemy and the prisoners being treated with all humanity.  An incident\r\nis told of him which brings into relief the better qualities of his\r\nrace.  One of his officers, pointing to the ghastly field, all strewn\r\nwith dead bodies, with severed limbs and mutilated trunks, said to the\r\nprince, \"Sir, behold your enemies at your feet.\"  The prince sighed.\r\n\"They are my father's subjects,\" he said, sadly, as he turned away.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Prestonpans is enshrined in Jacobite memories as the\r\nbattle of Gladsmuir, for a reason very characteristic of the Stuarts\r\nand their followers.  Some {216} queer old book of prophecies had\r\nforetold, more than a century earlier, that there should be a battle at\r\nGladsmuir.  The battle of Prestonpans was not fought really on\r\nGladsmuir at all: Gladsmuir lies a good mile away from the scene of\r\nCharles's easy triumph and Cope's inglorious rout; but for enthusiastic\r\nJacobite purposes it was near enough to seem an absolute fulfilment of\r\nthe venerable prediction.  A battle was to be fought at Gladsmuir; go\r\nto, then--a battle was fought at Gladsmuir, or near Gladsmuir, which is\r\nvery much the same thing: anyhow, not very far away from Gladsmuir.\r\nAnd so the Jacobites were contented, and more than ever convinced of\r\nthe advantages of prophecy in the affairs of practical politics.\r\n\r\nSome busy days were passed in Edinburgh in which councils of war\r\nalternated with semi-regal entertainments, and in which the prince\r\nemployed his ready command of language in paying graceful compliments\r\nto the pretty women who wore the white cockade, and in issuing\r\nproclamations in which the Union was dissolved and religious liberty\r\npromised.  One thing the young prince could not be induced to do: none\r\nof the arguments of his councillors could prevail upon him to threaten\r\nsevere measures against the prisoners fallen into his hands.  It was\r\nurged that unless the Government treated their prisoners as prisoners\r\nof war and not as rebels, the prince would be well advised to retaliate\r\nby equal harshness to the captives in his power.  But on this point the\r\nprince was obdurate.  He would not take in cold blood the lives that he\r\nhad saved in the heat of action.  Then and all through this meteoric\r\ncampaign the conduct of Charles was characterized by a sincere\r\nhumanity, which stands out in startling contrast with the cruelties\r\npractised later by his enemy, the \"butcher Cumberland.\"  It prevented\r\nthe prince from gaining an important military advantage by the\r\nreduction of Edinburgh Castle.  He attempted the reduction of the\r\ncastle by cutting off its supplies, but when the general in command\r\nthreatened to open fire upon the town in consequence, Charles\r\nimmediately rescinded the order, although {217} his officers urged that\r\nthe destruction of a few houses, and even the loss of a few lives, was\r\nin a military sense of scant importance in comparison with the capture\r\nof so valuable a stronghold as Edinburgh Castle.  The prince held\r\nfirmly to his resolve, and Edinburgh Castle remained to the end in the\r\nhands of the Royal troops.  Charles displayed a great objection, too,\r\nto any plundering or lawless behavior on the part of his wild Highland\r\narmy.  We learn from the Bland Burges papers that when the house of\r\nLord Somerville, who was opposed to the prince, was molested by a party\r\nof Highlanders, the prince, on hearing of it, sent an apology to Lord\r\nSomerville, and an officer's guard to protect him from further\r\nannoyance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1745--In the heart of England]\r\n\r\nBut time was running on, and it was necessary to take action again.\r\nEngland was waking up to a sense of its peril.  Armies were gathering.\r\nThe King had come back from Hanover, the troops were almost all\r\nrecalled from Flanders.  It was time to make a fresh stroke.  Charles\r\nresolved upon the bold course of striking south at once for England,\r\nand early in November he marched.  He set off on the famous march\r\nsouth.  In this undertaking, as before, the same extraordinary\r\ngood-fortune attended upon the Stuart arms.  His little army of less\r\nthan six thousand men reached Carlisle, reached Manchester, without\r\nopposition.  On December 4th he was at Derby, only one hundred and\r\ntwenty-seven miles from London.  Once again, by skill or by\r\ngood-fortune, he had contrived to slip past the English general sent\r\nout to bar his way.  Cumberland with his forces was at Stafford, nine\r\nmiles farther from the capital than the young prince, who was now only\r\nsix days from the city, with all his hopes and his ambitions ahead of\r\nhim, and behind him the hostile army of the general he had eluded.\r\nNever perhaps in the history of warfare did an invader come so near the\r\ngoal of his success and throw it so wantonly away; for that is what\r\nCharles did.  With all that he had come for apparently within his\r\nreach, he did not reach out to take it; the crown of England was in the\r\nhollow of his hand, and he opened his hand {218} and let the prize fall\r\nfrom it.  It is difficult to understand now what curious madness\r\nprompted the prince's advisers to counsel him as they did, or the\r\nprince to act upon their counsels.  He was in the heart of England; he\r\nwas hard by the capital, which he would have to reach if he was ever to\r\nmount the throne of his fathers.  He had a devoted army with him--it\r\nwould seem as if he had only to advance and to win--and yet, with a\r\nfatuity which makes the student of history gasp, he actually resolved\r\nto retreat, and did retreat.  It is true, and must not be forgotten,\r\nthat Charles did not know, and could not know, all his advantages; that\r\nmany of the most urgent arguments for advance could not present\r\nthemselves to his mind.  He could not know the panic in which\r\nHanoverian London was cast; he could not know that desperate thoughts\r\nof joining the Stuart cause were crossing the craven mind of the Duke\r\nof Newcastle; he could not know that the frightened bourgeoisie were\r\nmaking a maddened rush upon the Bank of England; he could not know that\r\nthe King of England had stored all his most precious possessions on\r\nboard of yachts that waited for him at the Tower stairs, ready at a\r\nmoment's notice to carry him off again into the decent obscurity of the\r\nElectorship of Hanover.  He could not know the exultation of the\r\nmetropolitan Jacobites; he could not know the perturbation of the\r\nHanoverian side; he could not know the curious apathy with which a\r\nlarge proportion of the people regarded the whole proceeding, people\r\nwho were as willing to accept one king as another, and who would have\r\nwitnessed with absolute unconcern George the Elector scuttling away\r\nfrom the Tower stairs at one end of the town, while Charles the Prince\r\nentered it from another.  These factors in his favor he did not know,\r\ncould not know, could hardly be expected even to guess.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1745--How London felt]\r\n\r\nThat the news of the rising produced very varied emotions in London we\r\nmay learn from the letters of Horace Walpole.  In one of September 6th\r\nto Sir Horace Mann, mixed with much important information concerning\r\n\"My Lady O\" and the Walpole promise of marriage \"to young {219}\r\nChurchill,\" comes news of the Pretender's march past General Cope, and\r\nvery gloomy forebodings for the result.  Another letter, which talks of\r\nthe Pretender as \"the Boy,\" and of King George \"as the _person_ most\r\nconcerned,\" presents the Hanoverian Elector as making very little of\r\nthe invasion, answering all the alarms of his ministers by \"Pho, don't\r\ntalk to me of that stuff.\"  Walpole's spirits has risen within the\r\nweek, for he is much amused by the story that \"every now and then a\r\nScotchman comes and pulls the Boy by the sleeve, 'Preence, here is\r\nanother mon taken,' then, with all the dignity in the world, the Boy\r\nhopes nobody was killed in the action.\"\r\n\r\nLondon at large vacillated very much as Horace Walpole vacillated.\r\nWhile on the one side Jacobites began to come out of the corners in\r\nwhich they had long lain concealed, and to air their opinions in the\r\nfree sunlight, rejoicing over the coming downfall of the House of\r\nHanover, authority, on the other hand, busied itself in ordering all\r\nknown Papists to leave the capital, in calling out the Train Bands, in\r\nfrequently and foolishly shutting the gates of Temple Bar, and, which\r\nwas better and wiser, in making use of Mr. Henry Fielding to write\r\nstinging satires upon the Pretender and his party, and hint at the\r\nsufferings which were likely to fall upon London when the Highlanders\r\nimported their national complaint into the capital.  A statesman is\r\nreported to have said that this disagreeable jest about the itch was\r\nworth two regiments of horse to the cause of the Government.\r\n\r\nYet, if London was excited, there was a tranquil London as well.  Mr.\r\nGeorge Augustus Sala, in that brilliant novel of his, \"The Adventures\r\nof Captain Dangerous,\" draws a vivid picture of this London with the\r\ntrue artist touch.  \"Although from day to day we people in London knew\r\nnot whether before the sunset the dreaded pibrochs of the Highland\r\nclans might not be heard at Charing Cross--although, for aught men\r\nknew, another month, nay, another week, might see King George the\r\nSecond toppled from his throne--yet to those who lived quiet {220}\r\nlives and kept civil tongues in their heads all things went on pretty\r\nmuch as usual. . . .  That there was consternation at St. James's, with\r\nthe King meditating flight, and the royal family in tears and swooning,\r\ndid not save the little school-boy a whipping if he knew not his lesson\r\nafter morning call. . . .  So, while all the public were talking about\r\nthe rebellion, all the world went nevertheless to the playhouses, where\r\nthey played loyal pieces, and sang 'God save great George, our King'\r\nevery night; as also to balls, ridottos, clubs, masquerades, drums,\r\nrouts, concerts, and Pharaoh parties.  They read novels and flirted\r\ntheir fans, and powdered and patched themselves, and distended their\r\npetticoats with hoops, just as though there were no such persons in the\r\nworld as the Duke of Cumberland and Charles Edward Stuart.\"  Fiction,\r\nthat most faithful and excellent handmaiden of history, here shows us\r\nno doubt very vividly what London as a whole thought and did in face of\r\nthe rebellion.  It is an old story.  Were not the Romans in the theatre\r\nwhen the Goths came over the hills?  Did not the theatres flourish,\r\nnever better, during the Reign of Terror?\r\n\r\nNor was London the only place which displayed a well-nigh stoical\r\nindifference to the progress of the rebellion.  If Oxford had a good\r\ndeal of Jacobitism hidden decorously away in its ancient colleges, if\r\nthere were a good many disloyal toasts drunk in the seclusion of\r\nscholastic rooms, there was apparently only a feeling of curious\r\nindifference at the rival university, for Gray has put it on record\r\nthat at Cambridge \"they had no more sense of danger than if it were the\r\nbattle of Cannae,\" and we learn that some grave Dons actually were\r\nthinking of driving to Camford to see the Scotch troops march past, \"as\r\nthough they were volunteers out for a sham-fight, or a circus\r\nprocession.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{221}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nCULLODEN--AND AFTER.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1745--Had he but known]\r\n\r\nThe prince did not know, and could not know, the exact condition of\r\nthings in the capital; did not know, and could not know, how many\r\nelements of that condition told in his favor, and how many against.\r\nBut what he could know, what he did know, was this: He was at the head\r\nof a devoted army, which if it was small had hitherto found its career\r\nmarked by triumph after triumph.  He was in the heart of England, and\r\nhad already found that the Stuart war-cry was powerful enough to rally\r\nmany an English gentleman to his standard.  Sir Walter Williams Wynn,\r\nwhom men called the King of Wales, was on his way to join the Prince of\r\nWales.  So was Lord Barrymore, the member of Parliament; so was many\r\nanother gallant gentleman of name, of position, of wealth.  Manchester\r\nhad given him the heroic, the ill-fated James Dawson, and a regiment\r\nthree hundred strong.  Lord James Drummond had landed at Montrose with\r\nmen, money, and supplies.  The young chevalier's troops were eager to\r\nadvance; they were flushed with victories; their hearts were high; they\r\nbelieved, in the wild Gaelic way, in the sanctity of their cause; they\r\nbelieved that the Lord of Hosts was on their side, and such a belief\r\nstrengthened their hands.  For a prince seeking his principality it\r\nwould seem that there was one course, and one only, to pursue.  He\r\nmight go on and take it, and win the great game he played for; or,\r\nfailing that, he might die as became a royal gentleman, sword in hand\r\nand fighting for his rights.  The might-have-beens are indeed for the\r\nmost part a vanity, but we can fairly venture to assert now that {222}\r\nif Charles had pushed on he would, for the time at least, have restored\r\nthe throne of England to the House of Stuart.  We may doubt, and doubt\r\nwith reason, whether any fortuitous succession of events could have\r\nconfirmed the Stuart hold upon the English crown; but we can scarcely\r\ndoubt that the hold would have been for the time established, that the\r\nOld Pretender would have been King James the Third, and that George the\r\nElector would have been posting, bag and baggage, to the rococo shades\r\nof Herrenhausen.   But, as we have said, failing that, if Charles had\r\nfallen in battle at the head of his defeated army, how much better that\r\nend would have been than the miserable career which was yet to lend no\r\ntragic dignity to the prolonged, pitiful, pitiable life of the Young\r\nPretender!\r\n\r\nHowever, for good or evil, the insane decision was made.  Charles's\r\ncouncil of war were persistent in their arguments for retreat.  There\r\nwere thirty thousand men in the field against them.  If they were\r\ndefeated they would be cut to pieces, and the prince, if he escaped\r\nslaughter, would escape it only to die as a rebel on Tower Hill,\r\nwhereas, if they were once back in Scotland, they would find new\r\nfriends, new adherents, and even if they failed to win the English\r\ncrown, might at least count, with reasonable security, upon converting\r\nScotland, as of old, into a separate kingdom, with a Stuart king on its\r\nthrone.  By arguments such as these the prince's officers caused him to\r\nthrow away the one chance he had of gaining all that he had crossed the\r\nseas to gain.\r\n\r\nIt is only fair to remember that the young prince himself was from\r\nfirst to last in favor of the braver course of boldly advancing upon\r\nLondon.  When his too prudent counsellors told him that if he advanced\r\nhe would be in Newgate in a fortnight, he still persisted in pressing\r\nhis own advice.  Perhaps he thought that where the stake was so great,\r\nand the chance of success not too forbidding, failure might as well end\r\nin Newgate as in the purlieus of petty foreign courts.  But, with the\r\nexception of his {223} Irish officers, he had nobody on his side.  The\r\nDuke of Perth and Sir John Gordon had a little plan of their own.  They\r\nthought that a march into Wales would be a good middle course to adopt,\r\nbut their suggestion found no backers.  All Charles's other counsellors\r\nwere to a man in favor of retreat, and Charles, after at first\r\nthreatening to regard as traitors all who urged such a course, at last\r\ngave way.  Sullenly he issued the disastrous order to retreat, sullenly\r\nhe rode in the rear of that retreat, assuming the bearing of a man who\r\nis no longer responsible for failure.  The cheery good-humor, the\r\nbright heroism, which had so far characterized him, he had now\r\ncompletely lost, and he rode, a dejected, a despairing, almost a doomed\r\nman, among his disheartened followers.  It is dreary reading the record\r\nof that retreat; yet it is starred by some bright episodes.  At Clifton\r\nthere was an engagement where the retreating Highlanders held their\r\nown, and inflicted a distinct defeat upon Cumberland's army.  Again,\r\nwhen they were once more upon Scottish soil, they struck a damaging\r\nblow at Hawley's army at Falkirk.  But the end came at last on the day\r\nwhen the dwindling, discouraged, retreating army tried its strength\r\nwith Cumberland at Culloden.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1746--The Duke of Cumberland]\r\n\r\nMen of the Cumberland type are to be found in all ages, and in the\r\nhistory of all nations.  Men in whom the beast is barely under the\r\nformal restraint of ordered society, men in whom a savage sensuality is\r\naccompanied by a savage cruelty, men who take a hideous physical\r\ndelight in bloodshed, darken the pages of all chronicles.  It would be\r\nunjust to the memory of Cumberland to say that in his own peculiar line\r\nhe had many, if any, superiors; that many men are more worthy of the\r\nfame which he won.  To be remembered with a just loathing as a man by\r\nwhom brutalities of all kinds were displayed, almost to the point of\r\nmadness, is not the kind of memory most men desire; it is probably not\r\nthe kind of memory that even Cumberland himself desired to leave behind\r\nhim.  But, if he had cherished the ambition of handing down his name to\r\nother times, \"linked with one virtue and a thousand crimes,\" if {224}\r\nhe had deliberately proposed to force himself upon the attention of\r\nposterity as a mere abominable monster, he could hardly have acted with\r\nmore persistent determination towards such a purpose.  In Scotland, for\r\nlong years after he was dead and dust, the mention of his name was like\r\na curse; and even in England, where the debt due to his courage counted\r\nfor much, no one has been found to palliate his conduct or to whitewash\r\nhis infamy.  As Butcher Cumberland he was known while he lived; as\r\nButcher Cumberland he will be remembered so long as men remember the\r\n\"Forty-five\" and the horrors after Culloden fight.  Some of those\r\nhorrors no doubt were due to the wild fury of revenge that always\r\nfollows a wild fear.  The invasion of the young Stuart had struck\r\nterror; the revenge for that terror was bloodily taken.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1746--Culloden]\r\n\r\nEverything contributed to make Culloden fatal to the fortunes of the\r\nPretender.  The discouragement of some of the clans, the disaffection\r\nof others, the wholesale desertions which had thinned the ranks of the\r\nrebel army, the prince's sullen distrust of his advisers, the position\r\nof the battle-field, the bitter wintry weather, which drove a blinding\r\nhail and snow into the eyes of the Highlanders, all these were so many\r\nelements of danger that would have seriously handicapped a\r\nbetter-conditioned army than that which Charles Stuart was able to\r\noppose to Cumberland.  But the prince's army was not well-conditioned;\r\nit was demoralized by retreat, hungry, ragged, dizzy with lack of\r\nsleep.  Even the terrors of the desperate Highland attack were no\r\nlonger so terrible to the English troops.  Cumberland had taught his\r\nmen, in order to counteract the defence which the target offered to the\r\nbodies of the Highlanders, to thrust with their bayonets in a slanting\r\ndirection--not against the man immediately opposite to its point, but\r\nat the unguarded right side of the man attacking their comrade on the\r\nright.\r\n\r\nAfter enduring for some time the terrible cannonade of the English, the\r\nbattle began when the Macintoshes charged with all their old desperate\r\nvalor upon the English.  {225} But the English were better prepared\r\nthan before, and met the onslaught with such a volley as shattered the\r\nHighland attack and literally matted the ground with Highland bodies.\r\nThen the Royal troops advanced, and drove the rebels in helpless rout\r\nbefore them.  The fortunes of the fight might have gone very\r\ndifferently if all the Highlanders had been as true to their cause as\r\nthose who formed this attacking right wing.  \"English gold and Scotch\r\ntraitors,\" says an old ballad of another fight, \"won . . . , but no\r\nEnglishman.\"  To no English gold can the defeat of Culloden be\r\nattributed, but unhappily Scotch treason played its part in the\r\ndisaster.  The Macdonalds had been placed at the left wing of the\r\nbattle instead of at the right, which they considered to be their\r\nproper place.  Furious at what they believed to be an insult, they took\r\nno part whatever in the fight after they had discharged a single\r\nvolley, but stood and looked on in sullen apathy while the left wing\r\nand centre of the prince's army were being whirled into space by the\r\nRoyalist advance.  The Duke of Perth appealed desperately and in vain\r\nto their hearts, reminded them of their old-time valor, and offered, if\r\nthey would only follow his cry of Claymore, to change his name and be\r\nhenceforward called Macdonald.  In vain Keppoch rushed forward almost\r\nalone, and met his death, moaning that the children of his tribe had\r\ndeserted him.  There are few things in history more tragic than the\r\npicture of that inert mass of moody Highlanders, frozen into traitors\r\nthrough an insane pride and savage jealousy, witnessing the ruin of\r\ntheir cause and the slaughter of their comrades unmoved, and listening\r\nimpassively to the entreaties of the gallant Perth and the death-groans\r\nof the heroic Keppoch.  In a few minutes the battle was over, the rout\r\nwas complete; the rebel army was in full retreat, with a third of its\r\nnumber lying on the field of battle; the Duke of Cumberland was master\r\nof the field, of all the Highland baggage and artillery, of fourteen\r\nstands, and more than two thousand muskets.  Culloden was fought and\r\nwon.\r\n\r\n{226}\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to believe the stories that have been told of\r\nCharles Stuart, attributing to him personal cowardice on the fatal day\r\nof Culloden.  The evidence in favor of such stories is of the\r\nslightest; there is nothing in the prince's earlier conduct to justify\r\nthe accusation, and there is sufficient evidence in favor of the much\r\nmore likely version that Charles was with difficulty prevented from\r\ncasting away his life in one desperate charge when the fortune of the\r\nday was decided.  It is part of a prince's business to be brave, and if\r\nCharles Stuart had been lacking in that essential quality of\r\nsovereignty he could scarcely have concealed the want until the day of\r\nCulloden, or have inspired the clans with the personal enthusiasm which\r\nthey so readily evinced for him.  Nor is it necessary for us to follow\r\nout in full the details of the unhappy young man's miserable flight and\r\nfinal escape.  Through all those stormy and terrible days, over which\r\npoetry and romance have so often and so fondly lingered, the fugitive\r\nfound that he had still in the season of his misfortune friends as\r\ndevoted as he had known in the hours of his triumph.  His adventures in\r\nwoman's dress, his escape from the English ship, the touching devotion\r\nof Flora Macdonald, the loyalty of Lochiel, the fidelity of Cluny\r\nMacpherson--all these things have been immortalized in a thousand tales\r\nand ballads, and will be remembered in the North Country so long as\r\ntales and ballads continue to charm.  At last, at Lochnanuagh, the\r\nprince embarked upon a French ship that had been sent for him, and\r\nearly in the October of 1746 he landed in Brittany.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1746--Cumberland's vengeance]\r\n\r\nThe horrors that followed Culloden suggest more the blood feuds of some\r\nsavage tribes than the results of civilized warfare.  Cumberland,\r\nflushed by a victory that was as unexpected as it was easy, was\r\nresolved to kill, and not to scotch, the snake of Jacobite\r\ninsurrection.  The flying rebels were hotly pursued--no quarter was\r\ngiven; the wounded on the field of battle were left cold in their\r\nwounds for two days, and then mercilessly butchered.  There is a story,\r\nwhich might well be true, and {227} which tells that as Cumberland was\r\ngoing over the field of dead and dying he saw a wounded Highlander\r\nstaring at him.  Cumberland immediately turned to the officer next to\r\nhim, and ordered him to shoot the wounded man.  The officer, with an\r\nhonorable courage and dignity, answered that he would rather resign his\r\ncommission than obey.  The officer of the story was the heroic Wolfe,\r\nwho was afterwards to become a famous general and die gloriously before\r\nQuebec.  It may be true; we may hope that it is, as it adds another\r\nornament to the historic decoration of a brave man--but history does\r\nnot, so far as we are aware, record the answer that Cumberland made to\r\nthis unexpected display of audacious humanity.\r\n\r\nThe cruelties of Culloden field were only the preface to the red reign\r\nof terror that Cumberland set up in the Highlands.  The savage temper\r\nof the Royal general found excellent instruments in the savage tempers\r\nof his soldiery.  Murder, rape, torture, held high carnival; men were\r\nhanged or shot on the slightest suspicion or on no suspicion; women\r\nwere insulted, outraged, killed; even children were not safe from the\r\nblood-lust of Cumberland's murderers.\r\n\r\nThe pacification of the Highlands was accomplished on much the same\r\nmethods as were afterwards employed to bring about the pacification of\r\nPoland.  Perhaps the most dramatically tragic of all the events after\r\nthe defeat of Charles Stuart are connected with the fate of those of\r\nhis adherents who were taken prisoners, and who were of too grave an\r\nimportance to be put to the sword at once or hanged out of hand.  Some,\r\nunhappily, of the followers of the young prince proved themselves to be\r\nunworthy of any cause of any monarch.  Aeneas Macdonald, John Murray of\r\nBroughton, Lord Elcho, and Macdonald of Barrisdale have left behind\r\nthem the infamous memory that always adheres to traitors.  The\r\nrevelations which John Murray made to save his own life were the means\r\nof sending many a gallant gentleman to Tower Hill.\r\n\r\nIn the end of July (of 1746) Westminster Hall was {228} brilliant with\r\nscarlet hangings, and crowded with an illustrious company, to witness\r\nthe trial of the three most important of the captured rebels, Lord\r\nKilmarnock, Lord Cromarty, and Lord Balmerino.  Walpole, who went to\r\nthat ceremony with the same amused interest that he took in the first\r\nperformance of a new play, has left a very living account of the scene:\r\nLord Kilmarnock, tall, slender, refined, faultlessly dressed, looking\r\nless than his years, which were a little over forty, and inspiring a\r\nmost astonishing passion in the inflammable heart of Lady Townshend;\r\nLord Cromarty, of much the same age, but of less gallant bearing,\r\ndejected, sullen, and even tearful; Balmerino, the very type and model\r\nof a gallant, careless old soldier.\r\n\r\nThere was no question of the prisoners' guilt; they were tried, were\r\nfound guilty, were sentenced to death.  Two of the prisoners had,\r\nhowever, many powerful friends--Kilmarnock and Cromarty; and the charm\r\nof Kilmarnock's presence had raised up for him many more friends, whose\r\ninfluence was exerted with the King.  For Balmerino nobody seems to\r\nhave taken the trouble to plead, and even King George, whose clemency\r\nwas not conspicuously displayed in his treatment of his prisoners,\r\nappears to have expressed some surprise at this, though he did not\r\nallow his regret to carry him so far as to extend his pardon to the\r\nstout old soldier.  The exertions of Lord Cromarty's friends, and\r\nespecially of Lady Cromarty, saved that prisoner's life.  It is said\r\nthat when the child which Lady Cromarty bore in her body during the\r\nterrible period in which she was pleading for her husband's life came\r\ninto the world, it carried a mark like the stroke of the executioner's\r\naxe upon its neck.  Kilmarnock and Balmerino died on Tower Hill on\r\nAugust 18, 1746.  Both died, as they had lived, like gentlemen and\r\nbrave soldiers.  It is, perhaps, to be regretted that Kilmarnock should\r\non the scaffold have expressed any regret for the part he had played in\r\nsupporting the Young Pretender against the House of Hanover.  He {229}\r\nhad gone gallantly into the game of insurrection, and he might as well\r\nhave played it out to the end.  At least he was the only one of all the\r\nseven-and-seventy rebels who were executed, from James Dawson to Simon\r\nLovat, who made upon the scaffold any retractation of the acts that he\r\nhad done.  It is impossible not to contrast Balmerino's dying words,\r\nand to like them better than the apologies of Kilmarnock.  Balmerino\r\nwas no subject of King George; he was his prince's man.  \"If I had a\r\nthousand lives I would give them all for him\" were his dying words, and\r\nbraver dying words were never spoken.  It was the old heroic spirit of\r\nabsolute loyalty to the annointed king which was of necessity dying\r\nout; which was to be repeated again half a century later in the hills\r\nand the forests of La Vendee.  The Stuarts were as bad, as worthless,\r\nas kings could well be, but they did possess the royal prerogative of\r\ninspiring men with an extraordinary devotion.  There was something to\r\nbe said for the cause which could send a man like Balmerino so\r\ngallantly to his death with such a brave piece of soldierly bluster\r\nupon his dying lips.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1746--Lord Lovat]\r\n\r\nA very different man died for the same cause upon the same scaffold a\r\nlittle later.  History hardly recalls a baser figure than that of Simon\r\nFraser (Lord Lovat).  He is remembered chiefly as the desperate\r\nshuffler and paltry traitor who tried to blow hot and cold, to fawn on\r\nHanover with one hand and to beckon the Stuarts with the other.  But\r\nhis whole career was of a piece with its paltry ending.  His youth and\r\nmanhood were characterized by a kind of savage lawlessness, like that\r\nof a Calabrian chieftain brigand or the brave of a Sioux band.  He was\r\ncruel, he was cunning; he was, in his wild Highland way, a voluptuary\r\nand a debauchee; he was treacherous and hideously selfish.  In his\r\nearlier days he had cast his eyes upon a lady, whom, for motives of\r\nworldly advantage as well as for her beauty, he had regarded as\r\nsuitable to make his wife.  Neither the young lady nor the young lady's\r\nfamily would listen to the suit of Captain Fraser, as he then {230}\r\nwas; whereupon Captain Fraser gathered together a select company of\r\nscoundrels, carried the young lady off by force, very much as Rob Roy's\r\nwild son did with the girl of whom he was enamoured, married her\r\nagainst her will by force, with the aid of a suborned priest, actually,\r\nso the story goes, cutting the clothes off her body with his dirk,\r\nwhile his pipers, in obedience to his orders, drowned the poor\r\ncreature's cries with their music.  Now, in the eightieth year of his\r\nage, he had come to his grim end.  He had broken most of the laws of\r\nearth and of heaven; he had ever tried to be in with both sides and to\r\ncheat both; he was always ready to betray and lie and cozen; seldom,\r\nperhaps, did a more horrible old man meet a more deserved doom; yet he\r\ndied with a bravery and a composure which were not to be expected.\r\nNothing in his life became him like to the leaving it.  Thanks to the\r\ngenius of William Hogarth, we all know exactly how Simon Fraser, the\r\nbad Lord Lovat, looked in those last days of his life when he lay in\r\nprison, his old body weak with many infirmities, and his old spirit\r\nstill scheming and hoping for the reprieve that did not come.  On April\r\n9th he was executed on Tower Hill.  His latest words were grotesquely\r\ninappropriate to his evil life.  With his lying lips he repeated the\r\nfamous line from Horace, \"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori,\" and\r\nwith that lie on his lips he knelt before the block and had his head\r\ncut off at one stroke.  His body was laid in the company of better men,\r\nby the side of Balmerino and Kilmarnock, in the Church of St. Peter on\r\nthe Green.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1745--William Hogarth]\r\n\r\nThe genius of William Hogarth is inseparably associated with the\r\nForty-five by reason of this famous portrait of Simon Lovat, and for\r\nyet another reason.  In this year (1745) William Hogarth was already\r\nexceedingly popular, although he had as yet failed to bask much in the\r\nsunshine of royal favor.  Those old, early days of poverty and struggle\r\nwere far behind.  The industrious apprentice had married his master's\r\ndaughter, fifteen years ago by this time, and Sir James Thornhill had\r\nforgotten his {231} wrath and forgiven the young painter who was so\r\nimmeasurably his superior.  \"The Harlot's Progress,\" \"The Rake's\r\nProgress,\" \"Industry and Idleness,\" and many another plate in the\r\nastonishing panorama of mid last century life, had earned for Hogarth a\r\nhigh position in the favor of the day; and when he posted down to St.\r\nAlbans, where wicked Simon Lovat lay sick, to receive the old traitor's\r\nlathered embrace and to make the famous engraving, William Hogarth was\r\na very distinguished person indeed.  The portrait of Simon Fraser had a\r\ngreat success.  Never did portrait bear more distinctly the impress of\r\nfidelity.  The unwieldy trunk, the swollen legs, the horrible, cunning,\r\nsatyr-like face with its queerly lifted eyebrows, its flattened sensual\r\nnose, and its enormous mouth, the odd dogmatic gesture with which the\r\nindex finger of the left hand touches the thumb of the right: all these\r\nthings William Hogarth immortalized--making Simon Fraser (Lord Lovat)\r\nwellnigh as familiar a personality to us as he was to any of the men be\r\nbetrayed or the women he wronged in the course of his base life.  The\r\nplate had a prodigious success.  The presses were hard at work for many\r\ndays, and could not print proofs fast enough.  \"For several weeks,\"\r\nsays Mr. Sala, \"Hogarth received money at the rate of twelve pounds a\r\nday for prints of his etching.\"  It was reduced in size and printed as\r\na watch-paper--watch-papers were vastly fashionable in those days--and\r\nin that Liliputian form it sold also in large quantities.  The infamy\r\nof the subject and the genius of the artist lent a double attraction to\r\nthe portrait.\r\n\r\nBut the portrait of Simon Fraser is not the only, is not perhaps even\r\nthe chief, connection of Hogarth with the Forty-five.  Whether Hogarth\r\ndid or did not do the sketch for the mezzotint engraving called\r\n\"Lovat's Ghost on Pilgrimage\" matters little.  He certainly did do the\r\nfamous picture and famous plate which is known as the \"March to\r\nFinchley.\"  Every one knows that marvellous and no doubt vividly\r\naccurate picture of the progress of the foot guards to Finchley Common\r\non their way to {232} Scotland; the riot, the debauchery, the\r\nconfusion, the drunkenness of the scene.  Those tipsy heroes,\r\nstaggering along to the tunes of tipsy drummer and tiny fifer, while\r\nDoll Tearsheet and Moll Flanders harass them with enforced embraces,\r\nplayed their part no doubt in the horrible cruelties which succeeded\r\nCulloden.  But, at the same time, these were among the soldiers who did\r\nsucceed in preventing England from being given over to the Jacobites,\r\nor who at least prevented the Stuart Prince from holding Scotland, and\r\nsetting up the Stuart throne there.  It may, therefore, be perhaps\r\npardoned to his majesty King George the Second if he did not quite\r\nappreciate the \"burlesque,\" even though that lack of appreciation made\r\nHogarth in a rage dedicate the plate to his majesty of Prussia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1788--\"Bonnie Prince Charlie\"]\r\n\r\nMisfortune followed most of the followers of Prince Charles.\r\nTullibardine died in the Tower a few days before his trial.  Charles\r\nRatcliffe, Lord Derwentwater's brother, was executed.  Sheridan died of\r\napoplexy in the November of 1746.  The Duke of Perth died on shipboard,\r\non his way to France, soon after Culloden.  The less conspicuous rebels\r\nsuffered as severely as the leaders.  The executions that took place at\r\nYork and Carlisle, at Penrith and Brampton, and on Kennington Common,\r\nbloodily avenged the blow that had been struck at the House of Hanover.\r\nA great number of prisoners who were not executed were shipped off as\r\nslaves to the plantations, a fate scarcely less terrible than death;\r\nsome were pardoned on consideration of their entering the service of\r\nthe King as sailors; some were pardoned later on; a few, it is said,\r\nescaped.  The sternest measures were taken to prevent any possibility\r\nof a further rising in Scotland.  The disarmament of the clans, which\r\nhad been carried out so imperfectly after the Fifteen, was now\r\nrigorously and effectually enforced.  The hereditary jurisdiction of\r\nthe chiefs of clans, which made those chiefs the petty kings of their\r\ndistricts, was abolished, and in their places the ordinary process of\r\nlaw was established, with its sheriffs {233} and sheriffs' substitutes,\r\nand its circuits of judges.  The national costume, the kilt, was\r\nproscribed under the severest penalties, though in the course of time\r\nthis proscription was gradually relaxed.  Every master of every private\r\nschool north of the Tweed was called upon to swear allegiance to the\r\nHouse of Hanover, and to register his oath.  The turbulent spirit and\r\nfine fighting qualities of the clans were turned to good account by the\r\nGovernment, who raised several Highland regiments, and thus succeeded\r\nin diverting to their own service all the restless and warlike energy\r\nwhich had hitherto been so troublesome to law and order.  It must be\r\nadmitted that the modern prosperity of Scotland dates in a great degree\r\nfrom the Forty-five.  The old conditions of life in the Highlands were\r\nconditions under which it was impossible for a country to thrive; and\r\nthough it is necessary to condemn the manner in which the Government,\r\nat all events in the earlier stages, attempted to effect the\r\npacification of Scotland, it is also necessary to admit that Scotland\r\nis probably more fortunate to-day than she would have been if victory\r\nhad been given to the Stuart at Culloden.\r\n\r\nOf that Stuart we may as well take leave now.  His subsequent career is\r\na most dispiriting study.  He hoped against hope for a while that this\r\nforeign power or that foreign power would lend him a helping hand to\r\nhis throne.  Expelled from France, he drifted to Italy, and into that\r\npitiable career of dissipation and drunkenness which ended so\r\ningloriously a once bright career.  To the unlucky women whom he loved\r\nhe was astonishingly brutal; he forced Miss Walkenshaw--the lady of\r\nwhom he became enamoured in Scotland--to leave him by his cruelty; he\r\nforced his unhappy wife, the Countess of Albany, to leave him for the\r\nsame reason.  Her love affair with the poet Alfieri is one of the\r\nfamous love-stories of the world.  It seems pretty certain that Charles\r\nStuart actually visited England once, if not more than once, after the\r\nForty-five, and that George the Third was well aware of his presence in\r\nLondon, and, with a contemptuous good {234} nature, took no steps\r\nwhatever to lay hands upon the rival who was dangerous no longer.  At\r\nlast, on January 31, 1788, or, as some have it, on January 30, the\r\nactual anniversary of the execution of Charles the First, Charles\r\nStuart died in Rome, and with him died the last hope of the Stuart\r\nrestoration in England.  Had Charles lived a little longer, he would\r\nhave seen in the very following year the beginning of that great storm\r\nwhich was to sweep out of existence a monarchical system as absolute as\r\nthat of the Stuarts had been, and to behead a monarch far less blamable\r\nthan Charles the First of England.  There is something appropriate in\r\nthis uncompromising devotee and victim of the principle of divine right\r\ndying in exile on the very eve of that revolution which was practically\r\nto abolish the principle of the divine right of kings forever.  Oddly\r\nenough, there are still devotees of the House of Stuart, gentlemen and\r\nladies who work up picturesque enthusiasms about the Rebel Rose and the\r\nRed Carnation, and who affect to regard a certain foreign princess as\r\nthe real sovereign of England.  But the English people at large need\r\nhardly take this graceful Jacobitism very seriously.  Jacobitism came\r\nto its end with Cardinal Henry dying as the pensioner of George the\r\nThird, and with Prince Charles drowning in Cyprus wine the once gallant\r\nspirit which, even at the end, could sometimes shake off its\r\ndegradation, and blaze into a moment's despairing brilliancy, at the\r\nthought of the Clans and the Claymores, and the brave days of\r\nForty-five.  And so, in the words of the old Saga men, here he drops\r\nout of the tale.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1745-1889--The Stuart charm]\r\n\r\nBut it is the curious characteristic of the ill-fated House of Stuart\r\nthat, through all their misfortunes, through all their degradations,\r\nthey have contrived to captivate the imagination and bewitch the hearts\r\nof many generations.  The Stuart influence upon literature has been\r\nastonishing.  No cause in the world has rallied to its side so many\r\npoets, named or nameless, has so profoundly attracted the writers and\r\nthe readers of romance, has bitten more deeply {235} into popular\r\nfancy.  Even in our own day, an English poet, Mr. Swinburne, who has\r\nnot tuned much to thrones fallen or standing, has been inspired by the\r\nold Stuart frenzy to write one of the most valuable of all the wealth\r\nof ballads that have grown up around the Stuart name.  In his \"A\r\nJacobite's Exile, 1746,\" Mr. Swinburne has summed up in lines of the\r\nmost poignant and passionate pathos all the feeling of a gentleman of\r\nthe North Country dwelling in exile for his king's sake.  The emotion\r\nwhich finds such living voice in the contemporary poetry, in the\r\nballads that men wrote and men sang, while the House of Stuart was\r\nstill a reality, while there were still picturesque or semi-picturesque\r\npersonages living in foreign courts and claiming the crown of England,\r\nfinds no less living voice in the words written by a poet of to-day,\r\nthough nearly a century has elapsed, since the hopes of the House of\r\nStuart went out forever.\r\n\r\n  \"We'll see nae mair the sea-banks fair,\r\n    And the sweet, gray, gleaming sky,\r\n  And the lordly strand of Northumberland,\r\n    And the goodly towers thereby:\r\n  And none shall know, but the winds that blow,\r\n    The graves wherein we lie.\"\r\n\r\nWhat was there, what is there, we may well ask, in that same House of\r\nStuart, in that same Jacobite cause, which still quickens in this\r\nlatter day a living passion and pathos, which can still inspire a poet\r\nof to-day with some of the finest verses he has ever written?  It may\r\nbe some consolation to the lingering adherents of the name, to those\r\nwho wear oak-apple on May 29th, and who sigh because there is no \"king\r\nover the water\" who can come to \"enjoy his own again\"--it may be some\r\nconsolation to them to think that if their cause can no longer stir the\r\nswords in men's hands, it can still guide their pens to as poetic\r\npurpose as it did in the years that followed the fatal Forty-five.  It\r\nmay console them too, perhaps, with a more ironical consolation, to\r\nknow that the greatest enthusiast about {236} all things connected with\r\nthe House of Stuart, the most eager collector of all Stuart relics, is\r\nthe very sovereign who is the direct descendant of the Hanoverian\r\nelectors against whom the clans were hurled at Sheriffmuir and at\r\nCulloden, the lady and queen whom it affords a harmless gratification\r\nto certain eccentric contemporary Jacobites to allude to as \"the\r\nPrincess Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1745--Swift and Stella]\r\n\r\nIn the wild October of the wild year of the Forty-five a great spirit\r\npassed away under the most tragic conditions.  While Scotland and\r\nEngland were raging for and against rebellion, the greatest mind of the\r\nage went grimly out in Ireland.  On October 19, 1745, Jonathan Swift\r\ndied.  For years he had been but in a living death.  Racked with pain,\r\nalmost wholly bereft of reason, sometimes raging in fits of madness, he\r\nwas a fearful sight to those who watched over him.  When the end came\r\nit came quietly.  He sank into sleep and did not wake any more.  He was\r\nin his seventy-eighth year when he died.  A dim stone upon the darkened\r\nwall of St. Patrick's Church in Dublin sums up, in words at once\r\ncruelly bitter and profoundly melancholy, the story of his life.  That\r\nmouldering inscription, niched in high obscurity, which sometimes stray\r\npilgrims from across the seas strain their sight to decipher in the\r\ngloom, is the self-uttered epitaph of Jonathan Swift.  We may translate\r\nit thus into English: \"Here resteth the body of Jonathan Swift, Dean of\r\nthis Cathedral Church, where fierce indignation can lacerate his heart\r\nno longer.  Go, traveller, imitate if thou canst a champion, strenuous\r\nto his uttermost, of liberty.\"\r\n\r\nA little way apart, shadowed by his name in death no less than in life,\r\nlies Stella, the pale, dark-haired child whose wide eyes filled with\r\nlove as they followed the poor and lonely scholar through stately Shene\r\nor the prim rococo epicureanism of Moor Park.  She sleeps as she lived,\r\nat her master's feet.  She dedicated all the days of her life to Swift\r\nwith a devotion which is wellnigh without a parallel in the history of\r\nwoman's love for man.  Those {237} who stand awe-struck and reverential\r\nin the quiet presence of the dead may well feel troubled by a haunting\r\ninfluence in the twilight air of the place.  It is the haunting\r\ninfluence of the secret of those two tortured lives, the secret that\r\nlies buried between their graves.  One forgets for the moment Swift,\r\nthe fierce fighting statesman, and thinks only of the lonely man who\r\nlived to lament for Stella.\r\n\r\nThere has hardly ever been in the world, or out of it, in the\r\nillimitable kingdoms of fancy, a more famous pair of lovers than these\r\ntwo.  Leila and Majnun, Romeo and Juliet, Petrarch and Laura--repeat\r\nwhat names we may of famous lovers that the fancies of poets have ever\r\nadored by the Tigris, or the Avon, or in the shadows of Vaucluse, the\r\nnames of Swift and Stella are found to appeal no less keenly to heart\r\nand brain, to the imagination and to pity.  Happy they were not, and\r\ncould not be.  When we read of Swift and Stella the mind naturally\r\nturns to that luckless pair of lovers whom Dante saw in the third\r\ncircle of hell, blown about forever on the racking wind, and finding\r\ncomfort through the lapse of eternal twilight in the companionship of\r\ntheir common doom.  They, too--Swift and Stella--seem driven by the\r\npitiless wind of fate; they have fallen upon evil days; they are\r\ngreatly gifted, noble, greatly unhappy; they are sustained by their\r\nstrange, exquisite friendship, by the community of genius, by a tender\r\naffection which was out of tune with the time and with their troubled\r\nlives.  So long as Stella lived Swift was never alone.  When she died\r\nhe was alone till the end.  There is nothing in literature more\r\nprofoundly melancholy than Swift's own eloquent tribute to the memory\r\nof his dead wife, written in a room to which he has removed so that he\r\nmay not see the light burning in the church windows, where her last\r\nrites are being prepared.  There is no greater and no sadder life in\r\nall the history of the last century.  The man himself was described in\r\nthe very hours when he was most famous, most courted, most flattered,\r\nas the most unhappy man on earth.  Indeed he seems to have been most\r\nwretched; he certainly {238} darkened the lives of the two or three\r\nwomen who were so unfortunate as to love him.  But we may forget the\r\nsadness of the personal life in the greatness of the public career.\r\nSwift was the ardent champion of every cause that touched him; the good\r\nfriend of Ireland; he was always torn with \"fierce indignation\" against\r\noppression and injustice.  Thackeray, whose reading of the character of\r\nSwift is far too generally accepted, finds fault with the phrase, and\r\nblames somewhat bitterly the man who uses it, \"as if,\" he says, \"the\r\nwretch who lay under that stone waiting God's judgment had a right to\r\nbe angry.\"  But it was natural that Swift, scanning life from his own\r\npoint of view, should feel a fierce indignation against wrong-doing,\r\ninjustice, dishonesty.  He was an erring man, but he had the right to\r\nbe angry with crimes of which he could never be guilty.  His ways were\r\nnot always our ways, nor his thoughts our thoughts; but he walked his\r\nway, such as it was, courageously, and the temper of his thoughts was\r\nnot unheroic.  He was loyal to his leaders in adversity; he was true to\r\nfriends who were sometimes untrue to him; his voice was always raised\r\nagainst oppression; he had the courage to speak up for Ireland and her\r\nliberties in some of the darkest days in our common history.  To\r\nThackeray he is only a \"lonely guilty wretch,\" a bravo, and a bully--a\r\nman of genius, employing that genius for selfish or vindictive purpose.\r\nTo soberer and more sympathetic judgment Thackeray's study of Swift is\r\na cruel caricature.  He may have been \"miserrimus,\" but Grattan was\r\nright when he appealed long after to the \"spirit of Swift\" as the\r\nspirit of one in true sympathy with the expanding freedom of every\r\npeople--a champion, strenuous to his uttermost, of liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{239}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nCHESTERFIELD IN DUBLIN CASTLE.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1746--Chesterfield in Dublin Castle]\r\n\r\nThe Jacobite rebellion had compelled the Government to withdraw some of\r\ntheir troops from the continent.  France for a while was flattered and\r\nfluttered by a series of brisk successes which left almost the whole of\r\nthe Austrian Netherlands in her possession at the end of the campaign\r\nof 1746.  The battle of Lauffeld, near Maestricht, in Holland, in the\r\nsummer of 1747, in which the allied Austrian, Dutch, and English armies\r\nwere defeated, especially exhilarated the French Jacobites.  The French\r\nwere commanded by Marshal Saxe, the victor of Fontenoy.  The English\r\ntroops were under the command of Cumberland, and Lauffeld was therefore\r\nregarded by them as in some sort avenging Culloden.  The victory was\r\nlargely due at Lauffeld, as it had been at Fontenoy, to the desperate\r\ncourage of the Irish Brigade, who, in the words of one of their\r\nenemies, \"fought like devils,\" and actually came very near to capturing\r\nCumberland himself.  But the tide of victory soon turned for France on\r\nland and sea, and she became as anxious to make a peace as any other of\r\nthe belligerent powers could be.  The French were sick of the war.\r\nHenry Pelham was writing to the Duke of Cumberland to tell him that no\r\nmore troops were to be had by England, and that, if they were to be\r\nhad, there was no more money wherewith to pay them.\r\n\r\nPolitical life in England had, during all this time, been passing\r\nthrough a very peculiar period of transition.  When we speak of\r\npolitical life we are speaking merely of the life that went on in St.\r\nJames's Palace, in the House of Lords, and in the House of Commons.\r\nThe great bulk {240} of the middle classes, and the whole of the poorer\r\nclasses all over Great Britain, may be practically counted out when we\r\nare making any estimate of the movement and forces in the political\r\nlife of that time.  The tendency, however, was even then towards a\r\ndevelopment of the popular principle.  The House of Lords had ceased to\r\nrule; the Commons had not yet begun actually to govern.  But the\r\nCommons had become by far the more important assembly of the two; and\r\nif the House of Commons did not govern yet, it was certain that the\r\nKing and the Ministry could only govern in the end through the House of\r\nCommons.  The sudden shuffle of the cards of fate which had withdrawn\r\nboth Walpole and Pulteney at one and the same moment from their place\r\nof command at either side of the field, brought with it all the\r\nconfusion of a Parliamentary transformation scene.  Nothing could have\r\nbeen more strictly in the nature of the burlesque effects of a\r\nChristmas pantomime than Walpole and Pulteney shot up into the House of\r\nLords, and Wilmington and Sandys set to carry on the government of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1743--\"The drunken Administration\"]\r\n\r\nYet a little, and poor, harmless, useless Wilmington was dead.  He died\r\nin July, 1743.  Then came the troubling question, who is to be\r\nPrime-minister?  The Ministerialists were broken into utter schism.\r\nThe Pelhams, who had for some time been secretly backed up by Walpole's\r\ninfluence with the King, were struggling hard for power against\r\nCarteret, and against such strength as Pulteney, Earl of Bath, still\r\npossessed.  Carteret had made himself impossible by the way in which he\r\nhad conducted himself in the administration of foreign affairs.  He had\r\ngone recklessly in for a thoroughly Hanoverian policy.  He had made\r\nEnglish interests entirely subservient to the interests of Hanover; or\r\nrather, indeed, to the King's personal ideas as to the interests of\r\nHanover.  Carteret had the weakness of many highly cultured and highly\r\ngifted men; he believed far too much in the supremacy of intellect and\r\nculture.  The great rising wave of popular opinion was unnoticed by\r\nhim.  He did not see that {241} the transfer of power from the\r\nhereditary to the representative assembly must inevitably come to mean\r\nthe transfer of power from the representatives to the represented.\r\nCarteret in his heart despised the people and all popular movements.\r\nFancy being dictated to by persons who did not know Greek, who did not\r\nknow German, who did not even know Latin and French!  He was fully\r\nconvinced for a while that with his gifts he could govern the people\r\nthrough the House of Commons and the House of Commons through the King.\r\nHe was not really a man of much personal ambition, unless of such\r\npersonal ambition as consists in the desire to make the most brilliant\r\nuse of one's intellectual gifts.  The effort to govern the House of\r\nCommons through the King interested him, and called all his dearest\r\nfaculties into play.  He scorned the ordinary crafts of party\r\nmanagement.  If he thought a man stupid he let the man know it.  He was\r\nrude and overbearing to his colleagues; insulting to people, however\r\nwell recommended, who came to him to solicit office or pension.  All\r\nthat sort of thing he despised, and he bluntly said as much.  \"Ego et\r\nrex meus\" was his motto, as we may say it was the motto of Wolsey.  Not\r\nWolsey himself made a more complete failure.  The King fought hard for\r\nCarteret; but the stars in their courses were fighting harder against\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nCarteret's term of office was familiarly known as \"the drunken\r\nAdministration.\"  The nickname was doubtless due in part to Carteret's\r\nlove of wine, which made him remarkable even in that day of\r\nwine-drinking statesmen.  But the phrase had reference also to the\r\nintoxication of intellectual recklessness with which Carteret rushed at\r\nand rushed through his work.  It was the intoxication of too confident\r\nand too self-conscious genius.  Carteret was drunk with high spirits,\r\nand with the conviction that he could manage foreign affairs as nobody\r\nelse could manage them.  No doubt he knew far more about continental\r\naffairs than any of his English contemporaries; but he made the fatal\r\nmistake which other brilliant foreign {242} secretaries have made in\r\ntheir foreign policy: he took too little account of the English people\r\nand of prosaic public opinion at home.  In happy intoxication of this\r\nkind he reeled and revelled along his political career like a man\r\ndelighting in a wild ride after an exciting midnight orgy.  He did not\r\nnote the coming of the cold gray dawn, and of the day when his\r\ngoings-on would become the wonder of respectable and commonplace\r\nobservers.\r\n\r\nThe cold gray dawn came, however, and the day.  The public opinion of\r\nthe country could not be kept from observing and pronouncing on the\r\ndoings of Carteret.  Carteret felt sure that he was safe in the favor\r\nand the support of the King.  He did not remember that the return of\r\nevery cold gray dawn was telling more and more against him.  The King,\r\nwho, with all his vagaries and brutalities, had a considerable fund of\r\ncommon-sense, was beginning to see that, much as he liked Carteret\r\npersonally, the time was fast approaching when Carteret would have to\r\nbe thrown overboard.  The day when the King could rule without the\r\nHouse of Commons was gone.  The day when the House of Commons could\r\nrule without the Sovereign had not come.\r\n\r\nIn truth, the Patriots were now put at a sad disadvantage.  It is a\r\ngreat triumph to overthrow a great Ministry, but the triumph often\r\ncarries with it a responsibility which is too much for the victors to\r\nbear, and which turns them into the vanquished before long.  So it\r\nfared with the Patriots.  While they were in opposition they had\r\npromised, as Sallust says Catiline and his friends did, seas and\r\nmountains.  Now the time had come to show what they really could do;\r\nand, behold, they could do nothing.  An opposition has a safe time of\r\nit which, being directly adverse on some distinct question, principle,\r\nor policy to the party in power, it is able to say, \"Let us come into\r\noffice and we will do the very opposite; we will try to undo all that\r\nthe present ministers have been doing,\" and is able to carry out the\r\npledge.  But the opposition to Walpole had lived and flourished by\r\nfinding {243} fault with everything he did merely because it was he who\r\ndid it, and with his way of doing everything merely because it was his\r\nway.  Nothing can be easier than for a group of clever and unscrupulous\r\nmen to make it hot for even the strongest minister if they will only\r\nadopt such a plan of action.  This was the plan of action of the\r\nPatriots, and they carried it out boldly, thoroughly, brilliantly, and\r\nsuccessfully.  But now that they had come into office they found that\r\nthey had not come into power.  The claim to power had still to be\r\nearned for them by the success of their administration; and what was\r\nthere for them to do?  Nothing--positively nothing--but just what their\r\ndefeated opponents had been trying to do.  Hanoverian policy,\r\nHanoverian subsidies, foreign soldiers, standing armies--these were the\r\ncrimes for which Walpole's administration had been unsparingly\r\nassailed.  But now came Carteret, and Carteret was on the whole rather\r\nmore Hanoverian than the King himself.  Pulteney?  Why, such influence\r\nas Pulteney still had left was given to support Newcastle and Pelham,\r\nWalpole's own pupils and followers, in carrying out Carteret's\r\nHanoverian policy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1743--An irreparable mistake]\r\n\r\nCarteret set up Lord Bath as leader of the Administration.  The two\r\nPelhams--the Duke of Newcastle and his brother, Henry Pelham--were\r\ntremendously strong in family influence, in money, in retainers,\r\nled-captains, and hangers-on of all kinds.  Pulteney, who had always\r\nheld a seat nominally in the Cabinet, although he had hitherto clung to\r\nhis determination not to take office, now suddenly thought fit to\r\nchange his mind.  Probably he already regretted deeply the fatal\r\nmistake which had made him refuse to accept any office on the fall of\r\nWalpole.  Perhaps he had fancied that the country and the Government\r\nnever could get on without him, and that he would have been literally\r\nforced to withdraw his petulant self-denying ordinance.  But the\r\nmistake was fatal, irreparable.  The country did not insist on having\r\nhim back at any price; the country did not seem to have been thinking\r\nabout him at all.  Now, when there seemed to be {244} something like a\r\nnew opportunity opening for him on the death of Lord Wilmington, he had\r\nthe weakness to consent to be put up as a candidate for the position of\r\nPrime-minister.  The effort proved a failure.  The Pelhams were not\r\nonly powerful in themselves, but they were powerful also in the support\r\nof Walpole.  Walpole still had great influence over the King, and he\r\nnaturally threw all that influence into the scale of the men who\r\nrepresented his own policy, and not into the scale of those who\r\nrepresented the policy of his enemies.  Walpole and the Pelhams carried\r\nthe day; Henry Pelham became Prime-minister, and from that time the\r\npower of Carteret was gone.  This was in 1743--we are now going back a\r\nlittle to take up threads which had to be dropped in order to deal with\r\nthe events springing out of the continental war, and especially the\r\nrebellion in Scotland--and in November, 1744, Carteret was driven to\r\nresign his office.  He had just become Earl Granville by the death of\r\nhis mother, and was exiled to the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nThe King, however, still kept up his desire to get back Lord Granville\r\nand to get rid of the Pelhams.  George had sense enough to despise the\r\ntwo brothers, and sense enough also to see when he could not do without\r\nthem.  During the February of 1746, while the Stuart rebellion was\r\nstill aflame, a ministerial crisis came on.  The Pelhams wished to\r\nbring Pitt into the Ministry; the King blankly refused.  But the King\r\ndid more than that: he began to negotiate privately with Lord Granville\r\nand Lord Bath.  The Pelhams knew their strength.  They at once threw up\r\ntheir offices; the whole Ministry resigned in a body.  The King found\r\nthat Carteret could not possibly form an administration which would\r\nhave any support worth a moment's consideration in either House of\r\nParliament.  The fortunes of Charles Stuart were still looking bright\r\nin the north, and the King found himself without a Ministry.  There was\r\nno course open to him but one, and that was to recognize the strength\r\nof the Pelhams and their followers, and to take back Newcastle and his\r\n{245} brother on any terms the conquerors might be pleased to dictate.\r\nThe Pelhams came back to what might almost be called absolute power.\r\nThe King was not likely soon again to trouble them with any hostile\r\nintervention.  Thus these two men, one stupid beyond sounding, the\r\nother of only fair abilities, rising a little above mediocrity, had\r\ngone into battle with some of the greatest statesmen and orators of the\r\nage, and had come out victorious.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1743-1746--The \"Broad-bottomed Ministry\"]\r\n\r\nHenry Pelham's administration was known by the slang nickname of the\r\n\"Broad-bottomed Ministry.\"  It is known by that nickname in history\r\nstill; will doubtless always keep the title.  The great overmastering\r\npassion of the Pelhams was the desire to keep office and power in their\r\nhands at any price.  Of the two brothers Henry Pelham was by far the\r\nabler man.  His idea was to get around him all the really capable\r\nadministrators and debaters of every party, and thus make up a Ministry\r\nwhich should be all-powerful, and of which all the power should be in\r\nhis hands.  Like his brother, the Duke of Newcastle, he had a sort of\r\nhalf good-natured cynicism which never allowed him to doubt that if the\r\noffices were offered to the men, the men would on any conditions accept\r\nthe offices.  The events that he had lately seen had not induced him in\r\nany way to modify his opinion.  He had heard Pitt thundering away\r\nagainst Carteret in exactly the same strain as Pitt and Carteret used\r\nto thunder against Walpole.  He had heard Pitt denounce Carteret as \"an\r\nexecrable, a sole minister, who had ruined the British nation, and\r\nseemed to have drunk of the potion described in poetic fiction which\r\nmade men forget their country.\"  He had seen the policy of Walpole\r\nquietly carried out by the very men who had bellowed against Walpole,\r\nand had succeeded at last in driving him from office forever.  He knew\r\nthat no one now among those who used to call themselves \"the Patriots\"\r\ncared one straw whether Spain did or did not withdraw her claim to the\r\nRight of Search.  His idea, therefore, was to get all the capable men\r\nof the various parties together, form them {246} into an\r\nadministration, and leave them to enjoy their dignity and their\r\nemoluments while the King and he governed the country.  It was in this\r\nspirit and with this purpose that he set himself to form the\r\n\"Broad-bottomed Ministry.\"  He was not, like his royal master,\r\ntormented or even embarrassed by personal dislikes; he would take into\r\nhis Ministry any one who could be of the slightest use to him.  He\r\nwould have kept Lord Carteret if Carteret had not made himself\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1745--The Chesterfield of Dublin Castle]\r\n\r\nThe time had already come when Chesterfield had to be taken into the\r\nAdministration again.  He had made himself so particularly disagreeable\r\nto the King when out of office, he had raked the Government, and even\r\nthe Court, so hotly with satire and invective in the House of Lords,\r\nthat George reluctantly admitted that it was better to try to live with\r\nsuch a man, seeing that it began to be impossible to live without him.\r\nSo it was settled that some place should be found for Chesterfield, and\r\nat the same time it was very desirable that a place should be found\r\nwhich would not bring him much into personal association with the King.\r\nThe condition of Continental Europe, the fluctuations of the war,\r\nsuggested a natural opportunity for making use of Chesterfield's\r\nadmitted genius for diplomacy, and accordingly he was sent back to his\r\nold quarters at the Hague.  He rendered some good service there; and\r\nthen suddenly the office of Viceroy of Ireland became vacant, and\r\nChesterfield was called from the Hague and sent to Dublin Castle in\r\n1745.  He had known nothing of Ireland; he had never before been put in\r\nany position where his gift of governing could be tried.  The gift of\r\ngoverning is of course something entirely different from the gift of\r\nmanaging diplomatic business; and Chesterfield had as yet had no chance\r\nof proving any capacity but that of a parliamentary orator and a\r\ndiplomatist.  \"Administration,\" according to Aristotle, \"shows the\r\nman.\"  Every one remembers the superb and only too often quoted Latin\r\nsentence which tells of one who by the consent of all would have been\r\ndeclared capable {247} of ruling if only he had not ruled.\r\nAdministration was to show the real Chesterfield.  He was just the sort\r\nof person to whom one would have expected the Latin saying to apply.\r\nWhat a likely man, everybody might have said, to make a great\r\nadministrator, if only he had not administered!  Chesterfield's record,\r\nhowever, must be read the other way.  If he had never had the chance of\r\nadministering the affairs of Ireland, how should we ever have known\r\nthat he had a genius for governing men?\r\n\r\nFor, in the minds of all who understand these times and those,\r\nChesterfield's short season of rule in Ireland was by far the greatest\r\nperiod of his career.  The Chesterfield of Dublin Castle was as high\r\nabove the Chesterfield of the House of Lords as Goldsmith the poet is\r\nabove Goldsmith the historian, or Blackstone the constitutional lawyer\r\nis above Blackstone the poet.  Judging of Chesterfield's conduct in the\r\nIrish Viceroyalty by Chesterfield's past career, men would have been\r\nentitled to assume that his sympathies would go altogether with the\r\ngoverning race in Ireland.  With them were the wealth, the rank, the\r\nfashion, the elegance, the refinement.  With them was the easy-going\r\nprofession of State religion--just the sort of thing that suited\r\nChesterfield's ways.  What sympathy could such a man as he have with\r\nthe Celtic and Catholic Irishman?  Why should he care to be popular\r\nwith such a population?  Even such gifted, and, on the whole, patriotic\r\nProtestants as Swift only sympathized with the Catholic Celts as an\r\nEnglishman living in Virginia, in the old plantation days, might have\r\nsympathized with the population of negro slaves.  Chesterfield might\r\nhave entered on his formal task in the temper of graceful levity and\r\nhigh-bred languid indifference.  He might have allowed the cultured and\r\nrespectable gentlemen who were his permanent officials to manage things\r\nas they had long been doing before his time, pretty much in their own\r\nway.  He might have given them politely to understand that so long as\r\nthey spared him any trouble in his unthankful task he would back them\r\nup in anything they did.  He {248} might have made it plain to the\r\nProtestant gentry and the Castle folk that his sympathies were all with\r\nthem; that he desired only to mix with them; and that it really did not\r\nmuch matter what the outer population in Ireland thought of him or of\r\nthem.  Thus he would easily have become the darling of Dublin Castle;\r\nand to most Irish Viceroys the voice of Dublin Castle was the voice of\r\nIreland; at all events, the only voice in Ireland to which they cared\r\nto listen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1745--The state of Ireland]\r\n\r\nWhat did Chesterfield find in Ireland when he came to undertake the\r\ntask of government in Dublin Castle?  He found a people oppressed\r\nalmost beyond endurance by a cruel and barbarous system of penal laws\r\ndirected against the profession and the practice of the faith to which\r\nthey were passionately devoted.  No people in the world's history, not\r\neven the Scottish Covenanters, were more absolutely absorbed by the\r\nzeal of their faith than the Irish Catholic Celts.  The Penal Laws were\r\ndevised and were being worked with the avowed intention of extirpating\r\neither the faith or the race--or, better still, the faith and the race.\r\n\"The Irish,\" said Dr. Johnson, \"bursting forth,\" as his biographer\r\ntells us, \"with a generous indignation,\" \"are in a most unnatural\r\nstate, for we see there the minority prevailing over the majority.\r\nThere is no instance, even in the ten persecutions, of such severity as\r\nthat which the Protestants of Ireland have exercised against the\r\nCatholics.\"  The Revolution, which had brought liberty of worship to\r\nEngland, had only brought harsher and more cruel repressive legislation\r\nagainst liberty of worship in Ireland.  Where Chesterfield got the\r\nideas which he carried out from the first in his government of Ireland\r\nit is hard to understand.  He must have had that gift of spontaneous\r\nsympathy which is the very instinct of genius in the government of a\r\npeople among whom one has not been born, among whom one has scarcely\r\nlived.  His mind seems to have taken in at a glance the whole state of\r\nthings.  Talleyrand said of Alexander Hamilton, the great American\r\nstatesman, that {249} he had \"divined Europe.\"  Chesterfield had\r\napparently divined Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe twin curses of Ireland at the time were the Penal Laws and the\r\ncorrupt administration of Dublin Castle.  Chesterfield determined to\r\nstrike a heavy blow at each of these evil things.  He saw that the\r\nbaneful class ascendency which was engendered by the Penal Laws was as\r\nbad in the end for the oppressors as for the oppressed.  He saw that it\r\nwas poisoning those who were administering it as well as those against\r\nwhom it was administered.  He could not abolish the Penal Laws or get\r\nthem repealed.  No man in his senses could have hoped to get the\r\nexisting Parliament either of England or of Ireland to do anything then\r\nwith the Penal Laws, except perhaps to try to make them a little more\r\nsevere and more tormenting.  Chesterfield did not waste a thought on\r\nany such device.  He simply resolved that he would not put the Penal\r\nLaws into action.  It has been said of Chesterfield's administration in\r\nIreland that it was a policy which, with certain reservations, Burke\r\nhimself might have originated and owned.  Chesterfield took the\r\ngovernment entirely into his own hands.  He did his very best to\r\nsuppress the jobbery which had become a tradition in the officialism of\r\nDublin Castle.  He established schools wherever he could.  He tried to\r\nencourage and foster new branches of manufacture, and to give a free\r\nway to trade, and a stimulus to all industrial arts and crafts.  He\r\nshowed himself a strong man, determined to repress crime and outrage,\r\nbut he showed himself also a just and a merciful man, determined not to\r\ncreate new crimes in the hope of repressing the old offences.  The\r\ncurse of Irish repressive government has always been its tendency to\r\nmake fresh crimes, crimes unknown to the ordinary law.  Chesterfield\r\nwould have nothing of the kind.  More than that, he would not recognize\r\nas offences the State-made crimes which so many of his predecessors had\r\nshown themselves ruthless in trying to repress.  The confidence of the\r\npeople began to revive under his rule.  The Irish {250} Catholic began\r\nto find that although the Penal Laws still existed, in all their\r\nblood-thirsty and stupid clauses, he might profess and practise his\r\nreligion without the slightest fear of the informer, the prison, the\r\ntransport ship, or the hangman.  Chesterfield asked for no additional\r\ntroops from England.  On the contrary, he sent away some of the\r\nsoldiers in Ireland to help the cause of the empire on the Continent.\r\nHe was buoyant with a well-grounded confidence; and there was something\r\ncontagious in his fearless generosity and justice.  The Irish people\r\nsoon came to understand him, and almost to adore him.  He was\r\ndenounced, of course, by the alarmists and the cowards; by the Castle\r\nhacks and the furious anti-Catholic bigots.  Chesterfield let them\r\ndenounce as long and as loudly as seemed good to them.  He never\r\ntroubled himself about their wild alarms and their savage clamor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1745-1746--Chesterfield's recall]\r\n\r\nProbably no Irishman who ever lived was a more bitter and\r\nuncompromising enemy of English rule in Ireland than John Mitchel, the\r\nrebel of 1848.  His opinion, therefore, is worth having as to the\r\ncharacter of Chesterfield's rule in Dublin Castle.  In his \"History of\r\nIreland,\" a book which might well be more often read in this country\r\nthan it is, Mitchel says of Chesterfield: \"Having satisfied himself\r\nthat there was no insurrectionary movement in the country, and none\r\nlikely to be, he was not to be moved from his tolerant courses by any\r\ncomplaints or remonstrances.  Far from yielding to the feigned alarm of\r\nthose who solicited him to raise new regiments, he sent four battalions\r\nof the soldiers then in Ireland to reinforce the Duke of Cumberland.\r\nHe discouraged jobs, kept down expenses. . . .  When some savage\r\nAscendency Protestant would come to him with tales of alarm, he usually\r\nturned the conversation into a tone of light badinage which perplexed\r\nand baffled the man.  One came to seriously put his lordship on his\r\nguard by acquainting him with the fact that his own coachman was in the\r\nhabit of going to mass.  'Is it possible?' cried Chesterfield: 'then I\r\nwill take care the fellow shall not drive me there.'  A {251} courtier\r\nburst into his apartment one morning, while he was sipping his\r\nchocolate in bed, with the startling intelligence that the Papists were\r\nrising in Connaught.  'Ah,' he said, looking at his watch, ''tis nine\r\no'clock--time for them to rise!'  There was evidently no dealing with\r\nsuch a viceroy as this, who showed such insensibility to the perils of\r\nProtestantism and the evil designs of the dangerous Papists.  Indeed he\r\nwas seen to distinguish by his peculiar admiration a Papist beauty,\r\nMiss Ambrose, whom he declared to be the only 'dangerous Papist' he had\r\nmet in Ireland.\"  Chesterfield himself has left an exposition of his\r\npolicy which we may well believe to be genuine.  \"I came determined,\"\r\nhe wrote many years after, \"to proscribe no set of persons whatever,\r\nand determined to be governed by none.  Had the Papists made any\r\nattempt to put themselves above the law, I should have taken good care\r\nto have quelled them again.  It was said that my lenity to the Papists\r\nhad wrought no alteration either in their religious or their political\r\nsentiments.  I did not expect that it would; but surely that was no\r\nreason for cruelty towards them.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1745-1746--Chesterfield's recall]\r\n\r\nIt is true that Lord Chesterfield's conduct in Ireland has been found\r\nfault with by no less devoted a friend of Ireland than Burke.  In his\r\nletter to a peer of Ireland on the Penal Laws against the Irish\r\nCatholics, Burke says: \"This man, while he was duping the credulity of\r\nPapists with fine words in private, and commending their good behavior\r\nduring a rebellion in Great Britain--as it well deserved to be\r\ncommended and rewarded--was capable of urging penal laws against them\r\nin a speech from the Throne, and of stimulating with provocatives the\r\nwearied and half-exhausted bigotry of the then Parliament of Ireland.\"\r\nBut Burke was a man whose public virtue was too high and unbending to\r\npermit him to make allowance for the political arts and crafts of a\r\nChesterfield.  It is quite true that Chesterfield recommended in his\r\nspeech that the Irish Parliament should inquire into the working of the\r\nPenal Laws in order to find out if they needed any {252} improvement.\r\nBut this was a mere piece of stage-play to amuse and to beguile the\r\nstupidity and the bigotry of the Irish Parliament of those days.  It\r\nwas not a stroke of policy which a man like Burke would have\r\ncondescended to or could have approved; but it must have greatly\r\ndelighted the cynical humor of such a man as Chesterfield.  At all\r\nevents it is certain that during his administration Chesterfield\r\nsucceeded in winning the confidence and the admiration of the Catholics\r\nof Ireland--that is to say, of five-sixths of the population of the\r\ncountry.  He was very soon recalled; perhaps the King did not quite\r\nlike his growing popularity in Ireland; and when he left Dublin he was\r\nescorted to the ship's side by an enthusiastic concourse of people, who\r\npressed around him to the last and prayed of him to return soon to\r\nIreland.  Chesterfield did not return to Ireland.  He was made one of\r\nthe Secretaries of State, and the Dublin Castle administration went on\r\nits old familiar way.  But there is even still among the Irish people a\r\nlingering tradition of the rule of Lord Chesterfield, and of the new\r\nsystem which he tried for a while to establish in the government of\r\ntheir island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{253}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nPRIMUS IN INDIS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1743--Nucleus of the Anglo-Indian Empire]\r\n\r\nBefore the Jacobite rising had been put down, or the Pelhams absolutely\r\nset up, England, without knowing it, had sent forth a new conqueror,\r\nand might already have hailed the first promises of sway over one of\r\nthe most magnificent empires of the earth.  The name of the new\r\nconqueror was Robert Clive; the name of the magnificent empire was\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nAt that time the influence of England over India was small to\r\ninsignificance--a scrap of Bengal, the island and town of Bombay,\r\nMadras, and a fort or two.  The average Englishman's knowledge of India\r\nwas small even to non-existence.  The few Englishmen who ever looked\r\nwith eyes of intelligent information upon that great tract of\r\nterritory, leaf-shaped, and labelled India on the maps, knew that the\r\nEnglish possessions therein were few and paltry.  Three quite distinct\r\nsections, called presidencies, each independent of the two others, and\r\nall governed by a supreme authority whose offices were in Leadenhall\r\nStreet in London, represented the meagre nucleus of what was yet to be\r\nthe vast Anglo-Indian Empire.  The first of these three presidencies\r\nwas the Bombay presidency, where the Indian Ocean washes the Malabar\r\ncoast.  The second was in the Carnatic, on the eastern side of the\r\nleaf, where the waters of the Bay of Bengal wash the Coromandel coast,\r\nwhere the forts of St. George and St. David protected Madras and a\r\nsmaller settlement.  The third presidency was up towards the north,\r\nwhere the sacred Ganges, rushing through its many mouths to the sea,\r\nfloods the Hoogly.  Here the town of Calcutta was growing up around\r\nFort William.\r\n\r\n{254}\r\n\r\nThese three little presidencies, plying their poor trade, and depending\r\nfor defence upon their ill-disciplined native soldiers, the Sepahis,\r\nwhom we have come to call Sepoys, were all that had grown out of the\r\nnearly two centuries of relations with the leaf-shaped Indian land\r\nsince first, in 1591, Captain Lancaster sailed the seas; since first\r\nthe East India Company sprang into existence.  It was not an agreeable\r\ntwo centuries for Englishmen who ever thought of India to read about.\r\nTwo centuries of squabblings and strugglings with Dutch settlers and\r\nwith Portuguese settlers, of desperate truckling to native princes.  In\r\n1664 the English East India Company found a rival more formidable than\r\nthe Dutch or the Portuguese in the French East India Company, which the\r\nastuteness of Colbert set up at Pondicherry, and which throve with a\r\nrapidity that quite eclipsed the poor progress of the English traders.\r\nEven when, in 1708, the old East India Company united its fortunes with\r\nthe new Indian Company that had been formed, and thus converted one\r\nrival into an ally, the superiority of the French remained uncontested,\r\nand daily waxed greater and greater, until it began to seem as if, in\r\nthe words of Antony to Cleopatra, all the East should call her mistress.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1725-1743--The Clives of Market-Drayton]\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of affairs in the year 1743, when the apparently\r\ninsignificant fact that a young gentleman of a ne'er-do-well\r\ndisposition, who seemed likely to come to a bad end in England, and who\r\nwas accordingly shipped off to India by his irritated relations,\r\naltered and exalted the destinies not merely of a wealthy trading\r\ncompany, but of the British Crown.  In the market town of\r\nDrayton-in-Hales, better known as Market-Drayton, in Shropshire, there\r\nlived, in the reign of George the First, a Mr. Richard Clive--a man\r\nwhose comparatively meagre abilities were divided between the\r\nprofession of the law and the cares of a small and not very valuable\r\nestate.  In the little town on the river Tern, within sight of the old\r\nchurch built by Stephen, whose architectural characteristics were then\r\nhappily unaltered by the hand of the {255} eighteenth century restorer,\r\nthe Clives had been born and given in marriage and died, and repeated\r\nthe round ever since the twelfth century.  Mr. Richard Clive, in the\r\nreign of George the First, married a Manchester lady named Gaskill, who\r\nbore him many children of no note whatever, but who bore him one very\r\nnoteworthy child indeed, his eldest son Robert, on September 29th, in\r\nthe year 1725.\r\n\r\nThere was a time, a long time too, during which the worthy Mr. Richard\r\nClive persisted in regarding the birth of this eldest son as little\r\nless than a curse.  He could very well have said of Robert what the\r\nQueen-mother says of Richard of Gloster, tetchy and wayward was his\r\ninfancy.  Seldom was there born into the world a more stubborn-minded,\r\nhigh-spirited boy.  He may remind us a little of the young Mirabeau in\r\nhis strenuous impassioned youth; in the estimate which those nearest to\r\nhim, and most ignorant of him, formed of the young lion cub in the\r\ndomestic litter; in the strange promise which the great career\r\nfulfilled.  There was a kind of madness in the impish pranks which the\r\nboy Clive played in Market-Drayton, scaring the timid and scandalizing\r\nthe respectable.  He climbed to the top of the lofty steeple of that\r\nchurch, which dated from the days of Stephen, and perched himself upon\r\na stone spout near the dizzy summit with a cool courage which Stephen\r\nhimself might have envied.  He got round him from among the idle lads\r\nof the town \"a list of lawless resolutes,\" and, like David, made\r\nhimself a captain over them for the purpose of levying a kind of\r\nguerilla warfare upon the shopkeepers of the little town, and making\r\nthem pay tribute for the sanctity of their windows.  In fact, he\r\nbehaved as wildly as the wildest school-boy could behave--drifting from\r\nschool to school, to learn nothing from each new master, and only to\r\nleave behind at each the record of an incorrigible reprobate.  Nobody\r\nseems to have discovered that there was anything of the man of genius\r\nin the composition of the incorrigible reprobate, and so it came about\r\nthat the town of {256} Market-Drayton in general, and the respectable\r\nfamily of the Clives in particular, breathed more freely when it was\r\nknown that young Robert was \"bound to John Company\"--that he had\r\naccepted a writership in the East India Service, and had actually\r\nsailed for Madras.\r\n\r\nThe career to which the young Clive was thus devoted did not, on the\r\nface of it, appear to be especially brilliant.  The voyage in itself,\r\nto begin with, was a terrible business; a six months' voyage was then\r\nregarded as an astonishingly quick passage, and in Clive's case the\r\nvoyage was longer even than usual.  It was more than a year after he\r\nleft England before he arrived at Madras, as his ship had stayed for\r\nsome months at the Brazils.  Clive arrived at Madras with no money,\r\nwith many debts, and with some facility in speaking Portuguese,\r\nacquired during the delay in the Brazils.  He had absolutely no friends\r\nin India, and made no friends for many months after his arrival.  It\r\nwould be hard to think of a more desolate position for a proud, shy,\r\nhigh-spirited lad with a strong strain of melancholy in his\r\ncomposition.  We find him sighing for Manchester with all the profound\r\nand pathetic longing which inspires the noble old English ballad of\r\n\"Farewell, Manchester.\"  It is not easy for us of to-day, who associate\r\nthe name of Manchester with one of the greatest manufacturing towns in\r\nthe world, to appreciate to the full either the spirit of the old\r\nballad or the longing aspiration which Clive had to see again\r\nManchester, \"the centre of all my wishes.\"  But if he was homesick, if\r\nhe was lonely, if he was poor in pocket and weak in health, shadowed by\r\nmelancholy and saddened by exile, he never for a moment suffered his\r\npride to abate or his courage to sink.  He treated his masters of the\r\nEast India Company with the same scornful spirit which he had of old\r\nshown to the shopkeepers of Market-Drayton and the school-masters of\r\nShropshire.\r\n\r\nIn the wretched mood of mind and body that Clive owned during his early\r\ndays at Madras the constitutional melancholy asserted itself with\r\nconquering force, and he {257} twice attempted his life.  On each\r\noccasion the pistol which he turned upon his desperate and disordered\r\nbrain missed fire.  Yet Clive had meant most thoroughly and\r\nconsistently to kill himself.  He did not, like Byron, discover, after\r\nthe attempt was made, that the weapon he had aimed at his life was not\r\nloaded.  Each time the pistol was properly charged and primed, and each\r\ntime it was the accident of the old flint-lock merely causing a flash\r\nin the pan which saved his life.  In a nature that is melancholy a\r\ntinge of superstition is appropriate, and it is hardly surprising if\r\nClive saw in the successive chance a proof that he was not meant as yet\r\nto perish by self-slaughter.  \"I must be destined for great things,\" he\r\nthought, and he was right.  Between that attempt at suicide and the\r\nnext lay long years of unexampled glory, lay the pomp of Oriental\r\ncourts and the glitter of Oriental warfare, lay the foundation and\r\nestablishment of that empire of India which is to-day one of the\r\ngreatest glories of the British Crown--an empire mightier, wealthier,\r\nstatelier than any which Aurungzebe swayed, and whose might and wealth\r\nand state were mainly due to the courage and the genius of the lonely,\r\nmelancholy lad, the humble writer in the service of John Company, who\r\nhad endeavored in his solitude and his despair to end his young life at\r\nthe muzzle of his pistol.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1707--The fall of the House of Baber]\r\n\r\nWhat was the condition of India at the time when Clive was making\r\nunavailing efforts to cut short his career?  The country itself was\r\ngiven over to the wildest confusion.  With the death of Aurungzebe, in\r\n1707, the majestic empire of the House of Baber came to an end.  The\r\nempire of Alexander did not crumble more disastrously to pieces after\r\nthe death of the Macedonian prince than did the empire of the Moguls\r\nfall to pieces after the death of Aurungzebe.  The pitiable and\r\ndespicable successors of a great prince, worse than Sardanapalus, worse\r\nthan the degraded Caesars of the basest days of Byzantium, squandered\r\ntheir unprofitable hours in shameful pleasure while the great empire\r\nfell to pieces, trampled by the {258} conquering feet of Persian\r\nprinces, of Afghan invaders, of wild Mahratta chiefs.  Between the\r\nfierce invaders from the northern hills who ravaged, and levied\r\ntribute, and established dominion of their own, and such still powerful\r\nviceroys as held their own, and offered a nominal allegiance to the\r\nMogul line, the glory of the race of Tamerlane was dimmed indeed.  It\r\noccurred to one man, watching all the welter of the Indian world, where\r\nMussulman and Hindoo struggled for supremacy--it occurred to Dupleix\r\nthat in this struggle lay the opportunity for some European power--for\r\nhis European power--for France--to gain for herself, and for the daring\r\nadventurer who should shape her Oriental policy, an influence hitherto\r\nundreamed of by the statesmen of the West.  It was not given to Dupleix\r\nto guess that what he dreamed of and nearly accomplished was to be\r\ncarried out at last by Robert Clive.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1746--La Bourdonnais]\r\n\r\nThe history of French empire in India contains two specially\r\nillustrious names--the name of La Bourdonnais and the name of Dupleix.\r\nThe first had practically called into existence the two colonies of the\r\nIle de France and of Bourbon; the second had founded the town of\r\nChandernagor, in the bay of Bengal, and, as governor-general of the\r\nFrench East India Company, had established himself at Pondicherry with\r\nall the luxury and more than all the luxury of a veritable Oriental\r\nprince.  It may be that if these two men had been better able to agree\r\ntogether the fortunes of the French nation in the Indies might have\r\nbeen very different.  But a blind and uncompromising jealousy divided\r\nthem.  Whatever Dupleix did was wrong in the eyes of La Bourdonnais;\r\nwhatever La Bourdonnais did was wrong in the eyes of Dupleix; and\r\nDupleix was the stronger man of the two, and he finally triumphed for a\r\ntime.  In the war that was raging La Bourdonnais saw his opportunity.\r\nHe determined to anticipate Dupleix in beginning hostilities against\r\nthe English in India.  He set sail from the island of Bourbon with a\r\nfleet of nine vessels which he had equipped, at his proper cost, and an\r\n{259} army of some three thousand men, which included a large\r\nproportion of negroes.  After a successful engagement with the ships of\r\nwar under the command of Admiral Burnett, outside Madras, La\r\nBourdonnais disembarked, besieged Madras, and compelled the town to\r\ncapitulate.  So far the star of La Bourdonnais was in the ascendent;\r\nbut the terms which he exacted from the conquered town were, by their\r\nvery moderation, the means of his undoing.  With the keys of the\r\nconquered town in his hand, with the French colors floating bravely\r\nfrom Fort St. George, with all the stored wealth of the company as\r\nspoils of war, La Bourdonnais thought that he might be not unlenient in\r\nthe terms he accorded to his enemies.  He allowed the English\r\ninhabitants of Madras to remain prisoners of war on parole, and\r\nstipulated that the town should remain in his hands until the payment\r\nof a ransom of some nine millions of francs.\r\n\r\nThe triumph of La Bourdonnais aroused, however, not the admiration but\r\nthe jealousy of Dupleix.  Out of La Bourdonnais's very victory the\r\ncunning of Dupleix discovered a means to humiliate his rival.  The\r\nvague schemes which he had formed for the authority of France, and for\r\nhis influence in India, did not at all jump with the restoration of\r\nMadras, once conquered, to the English.  He declared that La\r\nBourdonnais had gone beyond his powers; that terms to the vanquished on\r\nIndian soil could be made by the Governor of Pondicherry and the\r\nGovernor of Pondicherry alone.  He refused to ratify La Bourdonnais's\r\nconvention, and, instead, declared that the capitulation was at an end,\r\nmarched upon Madras, insisted upon the pillage and destruction of a\r\ngreat portion of the town, arrested a large number of the leading\r\nEnglishmen, including the Governor of Fort St. George, and conveyed\r\nthem with all circumstances of public ignominy to Pondicherry.  As for\r\nLa Bourdonnais, who had taken so gallant a step to secure French\r\nsupremacy in India, he was placed under arrest and sent to France,\r\nwhere the Bastille awaited him; he had fallen before his vindictive\r\nrival.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Madras, smarting under what may {260} fairly be\r\ncalled the treachery of Dupleix, considered rightly that they were no\r\nlonger bound by the convention with the luckless La Bourdonnais.  One\r\nat least of the inhabitants was a man not likely to be bound by the\r\nmere letter of a convention which had already been broken in the\r\nspirit.  Clive disguised himself as a Mussulman--we may be permitted to\r\nwonder how a man who to the end of his days remained eccentrically\r\nignorant of all Eastern languages accomplished this successfully--and,\r\nescaping from Madras, made his way to Fort St. David.  At Fort St.\r\nDavid his military career began.  The desperate courage which had\r\ncarried him to the top of the tower of Stephen's church, and which had\r\nenabled him to overawe the \"military bully who was the terror of Fort\r\nSt. David,\" now found its best vent in \"welcoming the French,\" like the\r\nhero of Burns's ballad, \"at the sound of the drum.\"  The peace which\r\nwas concluded between England and France sent Clive for a season,\r\nhowever, back to the counting-house, and gave back Madras again to the\r\nEnglish company.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1748--The dream of Dupleix]\r\n\r\nBut the ambition of Dupleix was not a thing to be bounded by the\r\ncircumscription of war or peace between England and France.  England\r\nand France might be at peace, but there was no need that the English\r\nEast India Company and the French East India Company should be at peace\r\nas well.  The internal troubles of India afforded Dupleix the\r\nopportunity he coveted of pushing his own fortunes, and doing his best\r\nto drive the English traders out of the field.  Unfortunately for him,\r\nhowever, his opportunity was also the opportunity of the young writer\r\nand ensign who had already won the admiration and the esteem of Major\r\nLawrence, then looked upon as the first English officer in India.\r\n\r\nWhile the French still held Madras, before the Treaty of\r\nAix-la-Chapelle compelled the reluctant Dupleix to restore it to the\r\nEnglish, a military episode, which might almost be called an accident,\r\nhad helped to confirm enormously the influence of France in India.  The\r\nNabob of {261} the Carnatic, offended by the action of the English\r\ngovernor of Madras, who had omitted to send him those presents which\r\nare essential to all stages of Oriental diplomacy, had practically\r\nwinked at the action of the more liberal-handed Dupleix in his movement\r\nagainst Madras.  When, too late, the Nabob heard of the fall of Madras,\r\nhe sent an army to recapture the town, and called upon the French\r\ngovernor to surrender it.  The governor was Duval D'Espremesnil, the\r\nfather of that mad D'Espremesnil who fuliginates through a portion of\r\nthe French Revolution.  He refused to obey the Nabob, opened fire upon\r\nhis forces, and repulsed them.  The repulse was followed a little later\r\nby a vigorous attack of the French troops under Paradis, which smashed\r\nthe armament of the Nabob to pieces at St. Thome on November 4, 1746.\r\nThis victory gave the French a prestige of which Dupleix was the very\r\nman to appreciate the full importance.  When, in 1748, Nizam-Al-Mulk,\r\nthe Viceroy of the Deccan, died, there arose at once pretenders not\r\nmerely to the Deccan viceroyalty, but also to the government of the\r\nCarnatic.  The first was claimed by Mirzapha Jung; the second by Chunda\r\nSahib.  Mirzapha Jung and Chunda Sahib, profoundly impressed by the\r\ntriumph of French arms two years earlier, appealed to Dupleix to help\r\nthem, joined their forces, and invaded the Carnatic.\r\n\r\nDupleix was not unwilling to listen to the appeal of the invaders.  He\r\nsaw that the chance had arisen for him to constitute himself the\r\nWarwick, the king-maker, of India.  He lent all the force of his\r\nEuropean troops, of his native troops trained in the European fashion,\r\nand of the prestige of France to the invaders.  The old Nabob of the\r\nCarnatic, Anaverdi Khan, was defeated and killed.  His son fled with\r\nhis broken army to Trichinopoly, and the invaders nominally, and\r\nDupleix actually, reigned supreme in the Carnatic.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the sun of Dupleix's fortunes reached its zenith.  He\r\nwas the chosen companion and confidant of the new Nizam of the Deccan;\r\nhe was made Governor {262} of India from the river Kristna to Cape\r\nComorin; he pomped it with more than Oriental splendor in the\r\npageantries of triumph at Pondicherry; he set up on the scene of his\r\nvictory a stately column, bearing in four languages inscriptions\r\ncelebrating his fame; he had treasure, power, and influence even to his\r\nambitious heart's content.  When Mirzapha Jung died, shortly after his\r\naccession to the government of the Deccan, Dupleix held equal influence\r\nover his successor.  He might well have believed that his glory was\r\ncomplete, his plans perfected; he might well have believed that he\r\ncould afford to smile at the feeble efforts which the English made to\r\nstay his progress.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1751--The defence of Arcot]\r\n\r\nHe soon ceased to smile.  Clive, then five-and-twenty years old, urged\r\nupon his superiors that Trichinopoly must soon fall before famine and\r\nleaguer, that with the overthrow of the House of Anaverdi Khan the\r\npower of the French over India would be established, and the power of\r\nthe English in India destroyed.  The great deed to be done was to raise\r\nthe siege of Trichinopoly.  This Clive coolly proposed to do by\r\neffecting a counter-diversion in besieging Arcot, the favored home of\r\nthe Nabobs.  With a little handful of an army--200 Europeans and 300\r\nSepoys--Clive marched through the wildest weather to Arcot, captured\r\nit, and prepared to hold his conquest.  We may perhaps here be\r\npermitted to say that in using, as we shall continue to do, the old\r\nfamiliar forms of spelling the names of Indian towns and of Indian\r\nprinces, we do so not in ignorance of the fact that in many, if not\r\nmost cases, they present but a very poor idea indeed of the actual\r\nOriental sounds and spelling.  The modern writers on Indian history\r\nadopt a new and more scientific spelling, which makes Arcot Arkat, and\r\nTrichinopoly Trichinapalli.  But, all things considered, it seems best\r\nfor the present to adhere to those old forms which have become, as it\r\nwere, portion and parcel of English history.\r\n\r\nChunda Sahib, who was besieging Trichinopoly, immediately despatched\r\n4000 men against Arcot, which, {263} joining with the defeated garrison\r\nand a few French, made up a muster of some 10,000 men under Rajah\r\nSahib, Chunda Sahib's son, against a garrison of little more than 300.\r\nThe defence of Arcot is one of the most brilliant episodes in history.\r\nIt reads rather like some of those desperate and heroic adventures in\r\nwhich the fiction of the elder Dumas delighted than the sober chronicle\r\nof recorded warfare.  For fifty days the siege raged.  For fifty days\r\nRajah Sahib did his best to take the town, and for fifty days Clive and\r\nhis little band of Europeans and Sepoys frustrated all his efforts.\r\nThe stubborn defence began to create allies.  The fighting capacity of\r\nthe English had come to be regarded with great contempt by the native\r\nraces, but the contempt was now rapidly changing to admiration.  Murari\r\nRao, the great Mahratta leader, who had been hired to assist the cause\r\nof Mohammed Ali, but who had hitherto hung in idleness upon the\r\nCarnatic frontier, convinced that the English must be defeated, now\r\ndeclared that since he had learned that the \"English could fight,\" he\r\nwas willing to fight for them, and with them, and prepared to move to\r\nthe assistance of Clive.  Before they could arrive, Rajah Sahib made a\r\ndesperate last effort to capture Arcot, was completely defeated with\r\ngreat loss, and withdrew from Arcot, leaving Clive and his little army\r\nmasters of the place.\r\n\r\nGreat was the glory of Clive in Fort St. George; but Clive was not\r\ngoing to content himself with so much and no more.  With an army\r\nincreased to nearly a thousand men, he assailed the enemy, defeated\r\nRajah Sahib once and again, and in his triumphal progress caused to be\r\nrazed to the ground the memorial city which the pride of Dupleix had\r\nerected to his victory, and the vaunting monument which set forth in\r\nfour languages the glory of his deeds.  The astonished Nabobs began for\r\nthe first time to understand that the glory of France was not\r\ninvincible, that a new star had arisen before which the star of Dupleix\r\nmust pale, and might vanish.  The star of Clive continued to mount.\r\nThough the arrival of Major Lawrence from {264} England took away from\r\nhis hands the chief command, he worked under Lawrence as gallantly as\r\nwhen he was alone responsible for his desperate undertakings, and\r\nsuccess, as before, followed all the enterprises in which he was\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nTrichinopoly was relieved; Chunda Sahib was captured by the Mahrattas\r\nand put to death; Covelong and Chingkeput, two of the most important\r\nFrench forts, were captured by Clive with an army as unpromising as\r\nFalstaff's ragged regiment.  At this point, and on the full tide of\r\nvictory, Clive's health broke down, and he was compelled to return to\r\nEngland for change of climate.  Before he left Madras he married Miss\r\nMaskelyne.  Never did a man return to his native land under more\r\nauspicious conditions who had gone thence under conditions so\r\ninauspicious.  The bad boy of Market-Drayton was now the illustrious\r\nand opulent soldier whom the gentlemen of the India House delighted to\r\nsalute as General Clive, and about whom it seemed as if it was\r\nimpossible for the nation to make too much ado.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1755--Back to India]\r\n\r\nClive was now seized with the ambition to play a part in home politics.\r\nThe general election of 1754 seemed to offer him a tempting opportunity\r\nof entering Parliament.  He came forward as one of the members for St.\r\nMichael's in Cornwall, was opposed by Newcastle, and supported by\r\nSandwich and Fox, was returned, was petitioned against, and was\r\nunseated on petition.  To fight a parliamentary election in those days\r\nmeant the spending of a very great deal of money, and Clive, who had\r\nsquandered his well-earned fortune right and left since his return to\r\nhis native land, found himself, after he was unseated, in a decidedly\r\ndisagreeable position.  His money was dwindling; his hope of political\r\ntriumphs had vanished into thin air; naturally enough, his thoughts\r\nturned back to the India of his youth.  The curious good-luck that\r\nalways attended upon him stood him in good stead here.  If he had need\r\nof the India of his youth, the India of his youth had need of him.  If\r\nFrance and England were not at {265} war, the rumor of war was busy\r\nbetween them, and there was a desire for good leaders in the advancing\r\nEnglish colonies in India.  Poor Dupleix was out of the way already.\r\nThe brilliant spirit whom Clive's genius had over-crowed had vanished\r\nforever from the scenes of his triumphs and his humiliations.  He had\r\nsuffered something of the same hard measure that he had himself meted\r\nout to his colleague La Bourdonnais; he had been recalled in\r\ncomparative disgrace to France, with ruined fortunes and ruined hopes,\r\nto die, a defeated and degraded man, the shadow of his own great name.\r\nBut the influence of France was not extinct in India; it might at any\r\nmoment reassert itself--at any moment come to the push of arms between\r\nFrance and England in the East as well as in the West; and where could\r\nthe English look for so capable a leader of men as Clive?  So it came\r\nabout that in the year 1755 Clive again sailed the seas for India,\r\nunder very different conditions from those under which he first\r\nadventured for the East.  Then he was an unknown, unappreciated\r\nrapscallion of a lad, needy, homesick, desperate, and alone; now he was\r\ngoing out as the Governor of Fort St. David, as lieutenant-colonel in\r\nthe British army, with a record of fame and fortune behind him.  New\r\nfame, new fortune, awaited him almost on the very moment of his arrival\r\nin India.  The pirate stronghold of Gheriah fell before him almost as\r\neasily as if the place had been a new Jericho and Clive a second\r\nJoshua.  But there was greater work in store for him than the\r\ndestruction of pirate strongholds.  Bengal became suddenly the theatre\r\nof a terrible drama.  Up to the year 1756 the tranquillity of the\r\nEnglish settlers and traders in Bengal had been undisturbed.  Their\r\nrelations with the Nabob Ali Vardi Khan had been of the friendliest\r\nkind, and the very friendliness of those relations had had the effect\r\nof making the English residents in Bengal, like the native population,\r\nmen of a milder mould than those whom hard fortune had fashioned into\r\nsoldiers and statesmen at Madras.  But in the year 1758 the Nabob Ali\r\nVardi Khan died, and was {266} succeeded by his grandson, Siraju'd\r\nDaulah, infamous in English history as Surajah Dowlah.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1756--The Blackhole]\r\n\r\nThis creature, who incarnated in his own proper person all the worst\r\nvices of the East, without apparently possessing any of the East's\r\nredeeming virtues, cherished a very bitter hatred of the English.\r\nSurajah Dowlah was unblessed with the faintest glimmerings of\r\nstatesmanship; it seemed to his enfeebled mind that it would be not\r\nonly a very good thing to drive the English out of Bengal, but that it\r\nwould be also an exceedingly easy thing to do.  All he wanted, it\r\nseemed to him, was a pretext, and to such a mind a pretext was readily\r\nforthcoming.  Had not the English dogs fortified their settlement\r\nwithout his permission?  Had they not afforded shelter to some victim\r\nflying from his omnivorous rapacity?  These were pretexts good enough\r\nto serve the insane brain of Surajah Dowlah.  He attacked Fort William\r\nwith an overwhelming force; the English traders, unwarlike, timorous,\r\nand deserted by their leaders, made little or no resistance; the madman\r\nhad Fort William in his power, and used his power like a madman.  The\r\nmemory of the Blackhole of Calcutta still remains a mark of horror and\r\nof terror upon our annals of Indian empire.  When Lord Macaulay,\r\neighty-four years after the event, penned his famous passage in which\r\nhe declared that nothing in history or in fiction, not even the story\r\nwhich Ugolino told in the sea of everlasting ice, approached the\r\nhorrors of the Blackhole, he wrote before the worst horrors of Indian\r\nhistory had yet become portion and parcel of our own history.  But even\r\nthose who write to-day, more than a century and a quarter after that\r\ntime; those in whose minds the memories are fresh of the butcher's well\r\nat Cawnpore and the massacre on the river-bank; those to whom the names\r\nof Nana Sahib and Azimoolah Khan sound as horridly as the names of\r\nfiends--even those can still think of the Blackhole as almost\r\nincomparable in horror, and of Surajah Dowlah as among the worst of\r\nOriental murderers.  It is true that certain efforts have been made to\r\nreduce the {267} measure of Surajah Dowlah's guilt.  Colonel Malleson,\r\nthan whom there is no fairer or abler Indian historian, thinks there\r\ncan be no doubt that Surajah Dowlah did not desire the death of his\r\nEnglish prisoners.  Mr. Holwell, one of the few survivors of that awful\r\nnight, the man whose narrative thrilled and still thrills, horrified\r\nand still horrifies, the civilized world, does give testimony that goes\r\ntowards clearing the character of Surajah Dowlah from direct complicity\r\nin that terrible crime.  \"I had in all three interviews with him,\" he\r\nwrote, \"the last in Darbar before seven, when he repeated his\r\nassurances to me, on the word of a soldier, that no harm should come to\r\nus; and, indeed, I believe his orders were only general that we for\r\nthat night should be secured, and that what followed was the result of\r\nrevenge and resentment in the breasts of the lower jemidars to whose\r\ncustody we were delivered for the number of their order killed during\r\nthe siege.\"  Yet these words do not go far to cleanse Surajah Dowlah's\r\nmemory.  What had occurred?  The English prisoners were brought before\r\nthe triumphant Nabob, bullied and insulted, and finally left in charge\r\nof the Nabob's soldiery, while the Nabob himself retired to slumber.\r\nThe soldiery, whether prompted by revenge or mere merciless cruelty,\r\nforced the prisoners, one hundred and forty-six in number, into the\r\ngarrison prison--a fearful place, only twenty feet square, known as the\r\nBlackhole.  The senses sicken in reading what happened after this\r\ndetermination was carried out.  The death-struggles of those unhappy\r\nEnglish people crowded in that narrow space, without air, in the\r\nfearful summer heat, stir the profoundest pity, the profoundest\r\nanguish.  The Nabob's soldiers all through that fearful night revelled\r\nin the sights and sounds that their victims' sufferings offered to them.\r\n\r\nWhen the night did end and the awakened despot did allow the door of\r\nthe Blackhole to be opened, only twenty-three out of the hundred and\r\nforty-six victims were alive.  The hundred and twenty-three dead bodies\r\nwere hurriedly buried in a common pit.\r\n\r\n{268}\r\n\r\nIt is simply impossible to exonerate Surajah Dowlah from the shame and\r\nstain of that deed.  The savage who passed \"the word of a soldier\" that\r\nthe lives of his prisoners should be spared took no precautions to\r\ninsure the carrying out of his promise.  If, as Mr. Holwell says, the\r\nlower jemidars were thirsting for revenge, then the Nabob, who gave his\r\nprisoners over to the care of those jemidars, was directly responsible\r\nfor their deeds.  Even in Surajah Dowlah's army there must have been\r\nmen, there must have been officers, to whom the tyrant, if he had\r\nwished his prisoners to be well treated, could have intrusted them, in\r\nthe full confidence and certainty that his commands would be carried\r\nout, and his humane wishes humanely interpreted.  But even if by the\r\nutmost straining we can in any degree acquit the Nabob of direct\r\npersonal responsibility before the act, his subsequent conduct involves\r\nhim in direct complicity, and forces upon him all the responsibility\r\nand all the infamy.  He did not punish the miscreants who forced their\r\nvictims into the Blackhole, and who gloated over their appalling\r\nsufferings.  He did not treat the survivors with ordinary humanity.  He\r\nwas evidently convinced that he could deal with the wretched English as\r\nhe pleased, that their power in India was annihilated, that Surajah\r\nDowlah was among the mightiest princes of the earth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1757--Plot and counterplot]\r\n\r\nFor six long months, for a fantastical half-year, Surajah Dowlah\r\nrevelled in the crazy dream of his own omnipotence.  Then came\r\nretribution, swift, successive, comprehensive.  Clive was upon\r\nhim--Clive the unconquerable, sacking his towns, putting his garrisons\r\nto the sword, recapturing those places from which Surajah Dowlah had\r\nimagined that he had banished the Englishman forever.  The news of the\r\ntragedy of the Blackhole, and of the capture of Calcutta and Fort\r\nWilliam, had reached Madras in August, and the warlike community had\r\nresolved upon prompt and speedy revenge.  But it took time to raise the\r\nexpedition, took time to despatch the expedition.  In October the army\r\nof two thousand four hundred men, {269} of which nine hundred were\r\nEuropean troops, and fifteen hundred Sepoys, sailed for the Hoogly,\r\nunder Clive as military, and Admiral Watson as naval, commander.\r\nHostile winds delayed the armament until December, but when it did\r\nreach its destination it carried all before it.  The luck which always\r\nattended upon Clive was still faithful to him.  The Nabob, at the head\r\nof his vast hordes, was soon as eager to come to terms with Clive at\r\nthe head of his little handful of men as he had before been eager to\r\nobliterate the recollection of the Englishmen from the soil of Bengal.\r\nHe offered to treat with Clive; he was ready to make terms which from a\r\nmilitary point of view were satisfactory; he was evidently convinced\r\nthat he had underrated the power of England, and he was prepared to pay\r\na heavy penalty for his blunder.\r\n\r\nWe are now approaching that chapter of Clive's career which has served\r\nhis enemies with their readiest weapon, and has filled his admirers\r\nwith the deepest regret.  The negotiations between Clive and Surajah\r\nDowlah were conducted on the part of all the Orientals concerned, from\r\nSurajah Dowlah to Omichund, the wealthy Bengalee who played the part of\r\ngo-between, with an amount of treachery that has not been surpassed\r\neven in the tortuous records of Oriental treachery.  But unhappily the\r\ntreachery was not confined to the Oriental negotiators; not confined to\r\nthe wretched despot on the throne; not confined to Meer Jaffier, the\r\nprincipal commander of his troops, who wanted the throne for himself;\r\nnot confined to the unscrupulous Omichund, who plotted with his left\r\nhand against Surajah Dowlah, and with his right hand against the\r\nEnglish.  Treachery as audacious, treachery more ingenious, treachery\r\nmore successful, was deliberately practised by Clive.  The brilliant\r\nand gallant soldier of fortune showed himself to be more than a match\r\nfor Oriental cunning in all the worst vices of a vicious Oriental\r\ndiplomacy.  If Surajah Dowlah was unable to make up his miserable mind,\r\nif he alternately promised and denied, cajoled and threatened, Clive,\r\non his side, while affecting to treat {270} with Surajah Dowlah, was\r\ndeliberately supporting the powerful conspiracy against Surajah Dowlah,\r\nthe object of which was to place Meer Jaffier on the throne.  If\r\nOmichund, with the keys of the conspiracy in his hand, threatened to\r\nbetray all to Surajah Dowlah unless he was promised the heaviest\r\nhush-money, Clive on his side was perfectly ready to promise without\r\nthe remotest intention of paying.  If Omichund, wary and suspicious,\r\nwas determined to have his bond in writing, Clive was quite ready to\r\nmeet him with a false and fraudulent bond.  Clive professed to be\r\nperfectly willing that in the secret treaty which was being drawn up\r\nbetween the English and Meer Jaffier a clause should be inserted\r\npromising the fulfilment of all Omichund's claims.  But as Clive had\r\nnot the remotest intention of satisfying those claims, he composedly\r\nprepared two treaties.  One--the one by which he and Meer Jaffier were\r\nto be bound--was written on white paper, and contained no allusion to\r\nthe avaricious Omichund.  [Sidenote: 1757--The Red Treaty] Another, on\r\nred paper, which was to be disregarded by the parties to the swindle,\r\ncontained a paragraph according to Omichund's heart's desire.  Thus bad\r\nbegins, but worse remains behind.  Clive, to his great astonishment,\r\nfound that Admiral Watson entertained different views from his about\r\nthe honor of an English soldier and gentleman.  However convenient it\r\nmight be to bamboozle Omichund with a sham treaty, Admiral Watson\r\ndeclined to be a party to the trick by signing his name to the\r\nfraudulent document.  Yet Admiral Watson's name was essential to the\r\nsuccess of the Red Treaty, and Clive showed that he was not a man to\r\nstick at trifles.  He wanted Admiral Watson's signature; he knew that\r\nOmichund would want Admiral Watson's signature; he satisfied himself,\r\nand he satisfied Omichund, by forging Admiral Watson's signature at the\r\nbottom of the Red Treaty.\r\n\r\nIt is simply impossible to imagine any defence of Clive's conduct in\r\nthis most disgraceful business.  The best that can be said for him is\r\nthat the whole process of the {271} treason was so infamous, the\r\nfabrication of the Red Treaty so revolting a piece of duplicity, that\r\nthe forging of Admiral Watson's name does not materially add to the\r\ndarkness of the complete transaction.  Nothing can palliate Clive's\r\nconduct.  It may, indeed, be said that as civilized troops after long\r\nengagements in petty wars with savage races lose that morale and\r\ndiscipline which come from contests with their military peers, so minds\r\nsteeped in the degrading atmosphere of Oriental diplomacy become\r\ninevitably corrupted, and lose the fine distinction between right and\r\nwrong.  But so specious a piece of special pleading cannot serve\r\nClive's turn.  English diplomacy at home and abroad has always, with\r\nthe rarest exceptions, plumed itself on its truthfulness, and has often\r\nbeen successful by reason of that very truthfulness.  The practically\r\nunanimous condemnation which Clive's countrymen then and since have\r\npassed upon his action with regard to the Red Treaty is the best answer\r\nto all such pitiful prevarications.\r\n\r\nHowever, Clive did prepare a sham treaty, did forge Admiral Watson's\r\nname, did fool Omichund to the top of his bent.  Omichund being thus\r\ncunningly bought over, Clive prepared for action, flung defiance at\r\nSurajah Dowlah, and marched against him.  On June 23, 1757, the fate of\r\nEngland in India was decided by the famous battle of Plassey, or, as it\r\nshould be more correctly called, Palasi.\r\n\r\nPlassey was a great victory.  Yet, in the words of the conspirator in\r\nBen Jonson's \"Catiline,\" it was but \"a cast at dice in Fortune's hand\"\r\nthat it might have been a great defeat, Clive was astonishingly,\r\ngrotesquely out-numbered.  The legendary deeds of chivalrous paladins\r\nwho at the head of a little body of knights sweep away whole hosts of\r\npaynims at Saragossa or Roncesvalles were rivalled by Clive's audacity\r\nin opposing his few regiments to the swollen armament of the Nabob.\r\nMoreover, Meer Jaffier, whose alliance with the English, whose treason\r\nto Surajah Dowlah, was an important part of the scheme, {272} was not\r\nto be counted upon.  He hesitated, unwilling to fling his fortunes into\r\nthe English scale before he was convinced that the English were certain\r\nof success, although he was himself one of the most important factors\r\nin the possibility of that success.  But the greatest danger that\r\nthreatened the English arms was, curiously enough, due to Clive\r\nhimself.  On the eve of Plassey he held a council of war at which it\r\nwas discussed whether they should fight at once or postpone fighting to\r\nwhat might seem a more seasonable opportunity.  Clive at this council\r\ndeparted from his usual custom.  He gave his own vote first, and he\r\nvoted against taking any immediate action.  Naturally enough, the\r\nmajority of the council of war voted with Clive, in spite of the\r\nstrenuous opposition of Major Eyre Coote and a small minority.  By a\r\nmajority of thirteen to seven it was resolved not to fight.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to speculate on what would have been the fortunes of the\r\nEnglish in Bengal if that vote had settled the question.  Luckily,\r\nClive was a man of genius, and was not either afraid to admit that he\r\nhad made a mistake, or to change his mind.  A short period of solitary\r\nreflection convinced him that he and the majority were wrong, and that\r\nEyre Coote and the minority were right.  He informed Eyre Coote of his\r\nnew decision, gave the necessary orders, and the next day the battle of\r\nPlassey was fought and won.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary here to go into the details of that momentous day.\r\nThe desperate courage, daring, and skill of the English troops carried\r\nall before them; their cannonade scattered death and confusion into the\r\nNabob's ranks.  Within an hour an army of sixty thousand men was\r\ndefeated, with astonishingly slight loss to the victors; Surajah\r\nDowlah, abandoned at the judicious moment by one traitor, Meer Jaffier,\r\nwas flying for his life in obedience to the insidious counsels of\r\nanother traitor, Rajah Dulab Ram.  From that hour Bengal became part of\r\nthe English empire.\r\n\r\n{273}\r\n\r\nThe fate of the different actors on the Indian side was soon decided.\r\nMeer Jaffier was duly invested with the Nabob's authority over Bengal,\r\nBehar, and Orissa; Omichund, on learning the shameful trick of the Red\r\nTreaty, went mad and died mad; Surajah Dowlah was soon captured and\r\npromptly killed by Meer Jaffier: the Blackhole was avenged.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1757--The conqueror returns]\r\n\r\nClive had now reached the pinnacle of his greatness.  Victor of\r\nPlassey, Governor of Bengal, he remained in India for three more\r\nresplendent years; he added to the number of his conquests by defeating\r\nthe great enterprise of Shah Alum against Meer Jaffier, and shattered\r\nthe Dutch descent upon the Hoogly--a descent secretly favored by the\r\never-treacherous Meer Jaffier--both on land and sea.  Then, with laurel\r\nvictory upon his sword, and smooth success strewn before his feet,\r\nClive resolved to return again to England.  He sailed from India, full\r\nof honors, in 1760, the year in which George the Second died.  When he\r\narrived in England George the Third was king.  Here for the moment we\r\nmust leave him, the greatest living soldier of his country, with a\r\ncareer of practically unbroken glory behind him.  He had reached his\r\napogee.  We shall meet with him again under less happy conditions, when\r\nthe sun of Plassey had begun to set.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{274}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nCHANGES.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1751--\"Give us back our eleven days\"]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile some changes were taking place in political affairs at home\r\nwhich were full of importance to the coming time.  William Pitt had\r\ntaken office; not, indeed, an office important enough for his genius,\r\nbut still one which gave him an opportunity of making his power felt.\r\nThe King still detested him; all the more, perhaps, because it was now\r\nbecoming more and more evident that the King would have to reckon with\r\nhim as Prime-minister before very long.  The stately form of Pitt was,\r\nindeed, already throwing a gigantic shadow before it.  Henry Fox, too,\r\nwas beginning to show himself an administrator and a debater, and, it\r\nmay be added, a political intriguer, of all but consummate ability.\r\nMurray was beginning to be recognized as a great advocate, and even a\r\ngreat man.  Lyttelton was still making brilliant way in politics, but\r\nwas even yet hovering somewhat uncertain between politics and\r\nliterature, destined in the end to become another illustration of the\r\ncareer marred for both fields by the effort to work in both fields.  On\r\nthe other hand, Chesterfield had given up office.  He had had a dispute\r\nwith his colleagues when he was strongly in favor of making a peace,\r\nand they would not have it, and he left them to go their own way.  He\r\nrefused the title of duke which the King offered him.  He withdrew for\r\nthe remainder of his years to private life, saying: \"I have been behind\r\nthe scenes both of pleasure and business; I have seen all the coarse\r\npulleys and dirty ropes which exhibit and move all the gaudy machines;\r\nand I have seen and smelt the tallow candles which illuminate the whole\r\n{275} decoration to the astonishment and admiration of the ignorant\r\nmultitude.\"  He seldom spoke in Parliament afterwards; he was growing\r\ndeaf and weary.  In 1751 he broke silence, and with success, when he\r\ndelivered his celebrated speech on the reform of the calendar.  He was\r\n\"coached,\" as we should say now, by two able mathematicians, the Earl\r\nof Macclesfield and Mr. Bradley.  The ignorant portion of the public\r\nwere greatly excited by what they considered the loss of eleven days,\r\nand were strongly opposed to the whole scheme.  Years later, when Mr.\r\nBradley was sinking under mortal disease, many people ascribed his\r\nsufferings to a judgment from Heaven for having taken part in that\r\n\"impious undertaking.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"impious undertaking\" was a very needed scientific reform in the\r\ncalendar, which had long before been adopted in some other countries.\r\nJulius Caesar was the first great regulator of the calendar; his work\r\nin that way was not the least wonderful of his achievements.  The\r\ncalculations of his astronomers, however, were discovered in much later\r\ntimes to be \"out\" by eleven minutes in each year.  When Pope Gregory\r\nthe Thirteenth came to the throne of the papacy, in 1572, he found that\r\nthe eleven minutes had grown by mere process of time to eleven days.\r\nHe started a new reform of the calendar, which was adopted at once in\r\nItaly, Spain, and Portugal.  It gradually commended itself to France\r\nand Germany, and it was adopted by Denmark and Sweden in 1700.  England\r\nonly came into line with the reform of the calendar in 1751.  The Act\r\nof Parliament which sanctioned the change brought in the use of the\r\nwords \"new style\" and \"old style.\"  Only Russia and Greece now of\r\nEuropean countries cling to the old style.  But the new style, as we\r\nhave said, was bitterly resented by the mob in England, and every one\r\nremembers Hogarth's picture of the patriot drunk in the gutter with his\r\nbanner near him bearing the inscription, \"Give us back our eleven days.\"\r\n\r\nChesterfield laughed at the success of his speech on the {276} reform\r\nof the calendar, and made little of it.  Perhaps he helped thus to\r\nexplain the comparative failure of his whole career.  Life was to him\r\ntoo much of a gibe and a sarcasm, and life will not be taken on those\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nLord Chesterfield was then out of the running, and Lord Granville's\r\nactive career had closed.  The men of the older school had had their\r\nday; the new men had pushed them from their stools.  The age of Walpole\r\nis closed.  The age of Chatham is about to open.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1751--Fred's epitaphs]\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1751 death removed one of the elements of discord\r\nfrom the family circle of George the Second.  The end had come for\r\nFrederick, Prince of Wales.  The long, unnatural struggle was brought\r\nvery suddenly to a close.  On the 12th of March, 1751, the prince, who\r\nhad been suffering from pleurisy, went to the House of Lords, and\r\ncaught a chill which brought on a relapse.  \"Je sens la mort,\" he cried\r\nout on the 20th of March, and the princess, hearing the cry, ran\r\ntowards him, and found that he was indeed dead.  The general feeling of\r\nthe country was perhaps not unfairly represented in the famous epigram\r\nwhich became the talk of the town:\r\n\r\n  \"Here lies Fred,\r\n  Who was alive and is dead.\r\n  Had it been his father,\r\n  I had much rather;\r\n  Had it been his brother,\r\n  Still better than another;\r\n  Had it been his sister,\r\n  No one would have missed her;\r\n  Had it been the whole generation,\r\n  Still better for the nation.\r\n  But since it is only Fred,\r\n  Who was alive and is dead,\r\n  There's no more to be said.\"\r\n\r\nIt is curious to contrast this grim suggestion for an epitaph on the\r\ndead prince with the stately volume which the University of Oxford\r\nissued from the Clarendon Press: \"Epicedia Oxoniensia in obitum\r\ncelsissimi et desideratissimi Frederici Principis Walliae.\"  Here an\r\n{277} obsequious vice-chancellor displayed all the splendors of a\r\ntinsel Latinity in the affectation of offering a despairing king and\r\nfather such consolations for his loss as the Oxonian Muses might offer.\r\nHere Lord Viscount Stormont, in desperate imitation of Milton, did his\r\nbest to teach\r\n\r\n  \"The mimic Nymph that haunts the winding Verge\r\n  And oozy current of Parisian Seine\"\r\n\r\nto weep for Frederick.\r\n\r\n  \"For well was Fred'rick loved and well deserv'd,\r\n  His voice was ever sweet, and on his lips\r\n  Attended ever the alluring grace\r\n  Of gentle lowliness and social zeal.\"\r\n\r\nThe hind who labored was to weep for him, and the artificer to ply his\r\nvaried woof in sullen sadness, and the mariner,\r\n\r\n          \"Who many moons\r\n  Has counted, beating still the foamy Surge,\r\n  And treads at last the wish'd-for beach, shall stand\r\n  Appall'd at the sad tale.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHere all the learned languages, and not the learned languages alone,\r\ncontributed their syllables of simulated despair.  Many scholastic\r\ngentlemen mourned in Greek; James Stillingfleet found vent in Hebrew;\r\nMr. Betts concealed his tears under the cloak of the Syriac speech;\r\nGeorge Costard sorrowed in Arabic that might have amazed Abu\r\nl'Atahiyeh; Mr. Swinton's learned sock stirred him to Phoenician and\r\nEtruscan; and Mr. Evans, full of national fire and the traditions of\r\nthe bards, delivered himself, and at great length too, in Welsh.  The\r\nwail of this \"Welsh fairy\" is the fine flower of this funeral wreath of\r\npedantic and unconscious irony.\r\n\r\nPoor Frederick had played a little with literature in his idle time.\r\nHe had amused himself with letters as he had amused himself with\r\nliterary men, and sometimes with rallying a bevy of the maids of honor\r\nto the bombardment of a pasteboard citadel and a cannonade of\r\nsugar-plums.  {278} He had written verses; among the rest, a love\r\ntribute to his wife, full of rapture and enriched with the most\r\noutspoken description of her various charms of person, which, however,\r\nhe assures us, were nothing to her charms of mind.  Probably he was\r\nvery fond of his wife; we have already said that it is likely he\r\ncarried on his amours with other women chiefly because he thought it\r\none of the duties of his princely station.  Perhaps we may assume that\r\nhe must have had some good qualities of his own; he certainly got\r\nlittle teaching or example of goodness from most of those who\r\nsurrounded him in the days when he could yet have been taught.\r\n\r\nThe new heir to the throne was George, Frederick's eldest son, who was\r\nborn in London on June 4, 1738, and was now, therefore, in his\r\nthirteenth year.  Frederick's wife had already given birth to eight\r\nchildren, and was expected very soon to bring forth another.  George\r\nwas a seven-months' child.  His health was so miserably delicate that\r\nit was believed he could not live.  It was doubted at first whether it\r\nwould be physically possible to rear him; and it would not have been\r\npossible if the ordinary Court customs were to be followed.  But the\r\ninfant George was wisely handed over to the charge of a robust and\r\nhealthy young peasant woman, a gardener's wife, who took fondest care\r\nof him and adored him, and by whose early nursing he lived to be George\r\nthe Third.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1753--The last of Bolingbroke]\r\n\r\nThe year 1751, which may be said to have opened with the death of poor\r\nFrederick, closed with the death of a man greater by far than any\r\nprince of the House of Hanover.  On December 12th Bolingbroke passed\r\naway.  He had settled himself quietly down in his old home at\r\nBattersea, and there he died.  He had outlived his closest friends and\r\nhis keenest enemies.  The wife--the second wife--to whom, with all his\r\nfaults, he had been much devoted--was long dead.  Pope and Gay, and\r\nArbuthnot, and \"Matt\" Prior and Swift were dead.  Walpole, his great\r\nopponent, was dead.  All chance of a return to public life had faded\r\nyears before.  New conditions and {279} new men had arisen.  He was\r\nold--was in his seventy-fourth year; there was not much left to him to\r\nlive for.  There had been a good deal of the spirit of the classic\r\nphilosopher about him--the school of Epictetus, not the school of\r\nAristotle or Plato.  He was a Georgian Epictetus with a dash of\r\nGallicized grace about him.  He made the most out of everything as it\r\ncame, and probably got some comfort out of disappointment as well as\r\nout of success.  Life had been for him one long dramatic performance,\r\nand he played it out consistently to the end.  He had long believed\r\nhimself a formidable enemy to Christianity--at least to revealed\r\nreligion.  He made arrangements by his will for the publication, among\r\nother writings, of certain essays which were designed to give\r\nChristianity its death-blow, and, having satisfactorily settled that\r\nbusiness and disposed in advance of the faith of coming ages, he turned\r\nhis face to the wall and died.\r\n\r\nThe reign of George the Second was not a great era of reform; but there\r\nwas accomplished about this time a measure of reform which we cannot\r\nomit to mention.  This was the Marriage Act, brought in and passed by\r\nLord Hardwicke, the Lord Chancellor, in 1753.  The Marriage Act\r\nprovided that no marriage should be legal in England unless the banns\r\nhad been put up in the parish church for three successive Sundays\r\npreviously, or a special license had been obtained from the archbishop,\r\nand unless the marriage were celebrated in the parish church.  The Bill\r\nprovided that any clergyman celebrating a marriage without these\r\nformalities should be liable to penal servitude for seven years.  This\r\npiece of legislation put a stop to some of the most shocking and\r\ndisgraceful abuses in certain classes of English social life.  With\r\nother abuses went the infamous Fleet marriages--marriages performed by\r\nbroken-down and disreputable clergymen whose headquarters were very\r\ncommonly the Fleet prison--\"couple-beggars\" who would perform the\r\nmarriage ceremony between any man and woman without asking questions,\r\nsometimes not even asking their names, provided {280} they got a fee\r\nfor the performance.  Men of this class, a scandal to their order, and\r\nstill more to the system of law which allowed them to flourish, were to\r\nbe found at almost every pothouse in the populous neighborhoods, ready\r\nto ply their trade at any moment.  Perhaps a drunken young lad was\r\nbrought up to be married in a half unconscious state to some elderly\r\nprostitute, perhaps some rich young woman was carried off against her\r\nwill to be married forcibly to some man who wanted her money.  The\r\nFleet parson asked no questions, did his work, and pocketed his\r\nfee--and the marriage was legal.  Lord Hardwicke's Act stopped the\r\nbusiness and relegated the Fleet parson to the pages of romance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1759--England's control in North America]\r\n\r\nYears went on--years of quiet at home, save for little ministerial\r\nwrangles--years of almost uninterrupted war abroad.  The peace that was\r\npatched up at Aix-la-Chapelle was evidently a peace that could not\r\nlast--that was not meant to last.  If no other European power would\r\nhave broken it, England herself probably would, for the arrangements\r\nwere believed at home to be very much to her disadvantage, and were\r\nhighly unpopular.  But there was no need for England to begin.  The\r\nFamily Compact was in full force.  The Bourbons of France were\r\ndetermined to gain more than they had got; the Bourbons of Spain were\r\neager to recover what they had lost.  The genius and daring of\r\nFrederick of Prussia were not likely to remain inactive.  As we have\r\nseen, the war between England and France raged on in India without\r\nregard to treaties and truces on the European continent.  There was, in\r\nfact, a great trial of strength going on, and it had to be fought out.\r\nEngland and France had yet another stage to struggle on as well as\r\nEurope and India.  They had the continent of North America.  There were\r\nalways some disputes about boundaries going on there; and a dispute\r\nconcerning a boundary between two States which are mistrustful of one\r\nanother is like a flickering flame close to a train of gunpowder.  The\r\nrenewal of war on the Continent gave for the first time its full chance\r\nto the {281} genius of William Pitt as a great war minister.  The\r\nbreaking out of war in North America established England as the\r\ncontrolling power there, and settled forever the pretensions of France\r\nand of Spain.  It is not necessary for us in this history to follow the\r\ncourse of the continental wars.  The great results of these to England\r\nwere worked out on other soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{282}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nCANADA.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1756--The struggle for Canada]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that, when the young Duke of Cumberland, after the battle\r\nof Culloden, was earning his right to the title of \"Butcher,\" one\r\nEnglish officer at least had the courage to protest by his actions\r\nagainst the atrocities of the English general.  That soldier was James\r\nWolfe, then a young lieutenant-colonel, who had served his\r\napprenticeship to arms in the Low Countries in the war of the Austrian\r\nSuccession, and earned by his courage and his abilities an honorable\r\nname.  He was destined to make that name famous by the part he was to\r\nplay in the events that were taking place in Canada.  The red-haired,\r\nunattractive soldier, whose cold and almost repellent manner concealed\r\nsome of the highest qualities, was fated to do as much for the glory of\r\nthe English Empire in one part of the world as Clive in another.  But\r\nthere could hardly be two men more different than Clive and Wolfe.  The\r\none was always an adventurer--a gentleman adventurer, indeed, and a\r\nbrilliant specimen of the class, but an adventurer still, and with some\r\nof the worst vices of his kind.  Wolfe, on the contrary, resembled more\r\nthe better men among those Puritan soldiers who rallied around the name\r\nof Cromwell and battled beneath the standards of Monk.  He cherished an\r\naustere ideal of public and private virtue.  The sweet, simple gravity\r\nof the man's nature lives for us very vividly in the portrait Thackeray\r\ndraws of him in the pages of \"The Virginians,\" where so many of the\r\nfamous figures of the crowded last century world seem to take bodily\r\nshape again and live and move around us.\r\n\r\n{283}\r\n\r\nFrom the end of the fifteenth century, when John and Sebastian Cabot\r\ndiscovered Canada, France considered that portion of the New World as\r\nher own.  Early in the sixteenth century a French expedition under\r\nVerazzani formed a settlement named New France, and eleven years later\r\nthe Breton Jacques Cartier ascended the St. Lawrence as far as the site\r\nof Montreal.  The first permanent settlement was made in 1608, when\r\nQuebec was founded.  From that time Quebec seems like the prize for\r\nwhich English and French arms are to strive.  Canada was taken by the\r\nEnglish in 1629, only to be restored in 1632; but when more than a\r\ncentury later France and England were newly at war, the serious and\r\nfinal struggle for the possession of Canada took place.\r\n\r\nThe French settlements in America were called Canada and Louisiana.\r\nThe one comprehended the basin of the St. Lawrence River and the Great\r\nLakes, with a vast extent of territory west and north to the Pacific\r\nand Arctic oceans.  It was, as has been happily said, a convenient\r\nmaxim in those days of our colonization, that whoever possessed the\r\ncoast had a right to all the inland territory as far as from sea to\r\nsea.  While this gave England its boundaries from north to south, it\r\nleft from east to west open to French fancy and French ambition.\r\nLouisiana was a term which covered in English eyes only the Mississippi\r\nmouths and a few stations along the Mississippi and Ohio valleys; in\r\nFrench minds the term extended to all the territory bounded to the\r\nnorth by Canada and to the south by Mexico, and stretching from the\r\nAlleghanies to the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe French settlements in Canada were administered very much upon the\r\nsame happy-go-lucky system as that which prevailed in France at home\r\nunder the beneficent influence of the Old Order, and which at home was\r\nslowly and surely preparing the way for the French Revolution.  The\r\nministers in Paris governed the colonies through governors who were\r\nsupreme in their own districts, but who possessed no power whatever of\r\ninitiating any laws for the people they swayed.\r\n\r\n{284}\r\n\r\nThe English colonies were very different from those of the French.\r\nFounded in the early days of religious persecution by men too\r\nstrong-minded to accept tyranny or to make composition with their\r\nconsciences, the new colonies of Englishmen in America had thriven in\r\naccordance with the antique spirit of independence which had called\r\nthem into existence.  The colonists were a hardy, a stubborn, and a\r\nhigh-minded people, well fitted to battle with the elements and the\r\nIndians, and to preserve, under new conditions, the austere standard of\r\nmorality which led them to look for liberty across the sea.  The creed\r\nwhich they professed endowed them with a capacity for self-government,\r\nand taught them the arts of administration and the polity of free\r\nStates.  The English colonies, as they throve and extended, were not\r\nwithout their faults.  The faith which their founders professed was a\r\ngloomy faith, and left its mark in gloom upon the characters of the\r\npeople and the tenor of their laws.  The Ironside quality of their\r\ncreed showed itself in the cruelties with which they visited the\r\nIndians; the severity of their tenets was felt by all who could not\r\nreadily adapt themselves to the adamantine ethics of men of the type of\r\nEndicott and Mather.  There was not wanting, too, a spirit of\r\nlawlessness in the English America, curiously in contrast with the\r\nlaw-abiding character of the Non-conformist colonizations.  Along the\r\nseaboard wild pirates nestled, skimmers of the seas of the most daring\r\ntype, worthy brethren of the Kidds, the Blackbeards, and the Teaches,\r\nterrors of the merchantman and the well-disposed emigrant.  But in\r\nspite of the sternness of the law-abiding, and the savageness of the\r\nlawless portions of the English settlements, they contrasted favorably\r\nin every way with the settlements which were nominally French and the\r\ncentres of colonization which hoisted the French flag.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1754--Young Mr. Washington]\r\n\r\nAfter a long stretch of threatened hostilities, the pinch came at last\r\nin 1753, when the two nations met on the banks of the Ohio.  The\r\nmeeting meant one of the greatest and most momentous series of wars in\r\nthe century.  {285} French soldiers invaded all the settlements of the\r\nOhio company and drove the settlers out.  The Governor of Virginia sent\r\nan ambassador to the French officer commanding on the Ohio, and chose\r\nas his ambassador a young Virginian gentleman then absolutely unknown\r\nexcept to the small circle of his personal friends, but destined to\r\nbecome one of the most famous, and most deservedly famous, men in\r\nhistory.  Young Mr. George Washington bore Governor Dinwiddie's message\r\nover 500 miles through the wilderness at the peril of his life.  That\r\nexpedition, says Irving, \"may be considered the foundation of his\r\nfortunes.  From that moment he was the rising hope of Virginia.\"  The\r\nFrench commander informed the young envoy that he proposed to hold Ohio\r\nand drive the English out.  Back went George Washington through the\r\nwilderness again with this discouraging reply.  After that hostilities\r\nwere inevitable.  The next year Washington, then lieutenant-colonel,\r\nled a small force to the frontier, and fired the first shot against the\r\nenemy.  It is curious to think of all the results that followed from\r\nthat first shot.  The fall of the French colonies in America, the\r\nestablishment of the American Republic, the French Revolution--all may,\r\nby the simplest process of causation, be traced back to the first shot\r\nfired by Washington's command against a petty officer on the frontier.\r\nThat shot echoes on the Plains of Abraham, at Lexington and Bunker's\r\nHill, at the taking of the Bastille, and with the \"whiff of\r\ngrape-shot\"; we may hear it at Waterloo and in the autumn horrors of\r\nthe Coup d'État.\r\n\r\nFrance had long been ambitious of extending the domain of her colonial\r\nempire in America.  Her aim was to secure for herself the Mississippi\r\nand Ohio valleys.  Securing these meant many things to France.  It\r\nmeant the connection of her Mexican colonies with Canada, but it meant\r\nmuch more than this; it meant serious annoyance to England, serious\r\nlimitation to English commerce.  It would make the Alleghany mountains\r\nthe western limits of the English colonies, hamper the English trade\r\nwith {286} the Indians, and expose to French attack the English on the\r\nnorth, south, and west.  In this year 1754, therefore, she deliberately\r\ndrove the English out of West Pennsylvania, and set up her staff there\r\nby building Fort Duquesne to command the Ohio Valley.  At that time the\r\nchief British commander in America was General Braddock, a joyous,\r\nrollicking soldier of the old-fashioned type, rather popular in London\r\nas a good companion and good fellow, who loved his glass with a more\r\nthan merely convivial enthusiasm.  But he was not the sort of man who\r\nwas fitted to fight the French just then and there.  In the open field\r\nand under ordinary conditions he might have done well enough, but the\r\nwar with France in the American colonies was not pursued under ordinary\r\nconditions.  It was fought on the lines of Indian warfare, with\r\nmurderous Indian allies, against whom the jolly general of the London\r\ntables and the St. James's clubs was wholly unfitted to cope.  Though\r\nhe had been warned by Sir P. K. Halkett, who knew the danger, Braddock\r\nactually insisted upon advancing with astonishing recklessness against\r\nFort Duquesne as if he were marching at the head of an invincible force\r\nto the easiest possible success.  The result of his heedlessness is one\r\nof the grimmest spots in English colonial history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1759--James Wolfe]\r\n\r\nBraddock's forces were cut to pieces: very few of his stout thousand\r\nescaped to spread horror through the English colonies by the news of\r\ntheir misfortunes.  The banner of the Leopard had gone down indeed\r\nbefore the white coats and the Silver Lilies of France and the painted\r\nfantasies of Indian braves and sachems.  The fair hair of English\r\nsoldiers graced the wigwams of the wild and remorseless Red Man, and it\r\nseemed for the moment as if the fighting power of England had gone.\r\nBut, indeed, English fighting power was made of sterner stuff.  The\r\nfact is, perhaps, never more happily exemplified than in this very\r\nstory of the dying Braddock himself.  As he was carried away, bleeding,\r\nto his death, from that fatal ambuscade, something of the hero animated\r\nand exalted {287} the spirit of that drink-hardy and foolhardy soldier.\r\n\"I must do better another time,\" he is reported to have said; and it\r\nwould not be easy to say with what gallanter words a stout soldier\r\ncould go to his account.  Against such a spirit as that which animated\r\nthe dying Braddock the soldiers of France were not destined to triumph.\r\n\"The last of the Gracchi,\" said Mirabeau, \"when dying, flung dust to\r\nheaven, and from that dust sprang Marias.\"  Braddock, promising himself\r\nto do better next time, spoke not indeed for himself, but for his\r\nnation.  The next time came in its due season, but the man who \"did\r\nbetter,\" who carried that \"banner of the Leopard\" high over the Lilies,\r\nwas not Braddock, but James Wolfe.\r\n\r\nEngland thirsted for revenge.  The years came and the years went, and\r\nat last they brought the hour and the men.  An elaborate campaign in\r\n1759 had been prepared, by which Amherst, coming by Lake George,\r\nTiconderoga, and Lake Champlain; Prideaux and Johnson coming by Fort\r\nNiagara, Lake Ontario, and Montreal; and Wolfe coming by the St.\r\nLawrence River, were to unite in attacking Quebec.  But the first two\r\ndivisions of the whole force were unable to make the connection in the\r\ndue time, and to Wolfe's command alone was given the honor of assailing\r\nQuebec.  He advanced up the St. Lawrence with some 7000 men and the\r\nfleet under Admiral Saunders, and encamped on the Island of St. Orleans\r\nin the St. Lawrence River, some eight miles from Quebec.  The whole\r\nworld, perhaps, hardly holds a scene more picturesque, whether looked\r\nat from above or from below, from the rock or from the river, than that\r\nwhich is given by the city of Quebec.  At some places the bold mass of\r\nrock and clay descends almost sheer to the lower level and the\r\nriver-shore.  One can see that splendid heap of rock and clay from the\r\ndistant Falls of Montmorency, standing out as the Acropolis of Athens\r\nor as Acrocorinth may be seen from some far-off point of view.  The\r\nnewer part of the city and the fortifications are perched high upon the\r\ngreat mound or mass of clay and rock, which looks over the {288}\r\nconfluence of a mighty river and a great stream.  The lower and older\r\ntown creeps and straggles along the base of the rock and by the edges\r\nof the river.  Here are the old market-places, the quaint old streets,\r\nthe ancient wharfs, the crumbling houses, the narrow lanes, the curious\r\ninlets, of past generations, and the crude shanties of yesterday and\r\nthe day before yesterday.  From this lower level broad roads now wind\r\nup to what would be called the better part of the city--the region of\r\nthe hotels, and the clubs, and the official buildings, and the\r\nfashionable residences.  But until lately these roads passed under the\r\nancient gate-ways of the city--gate-ways that reminded one of the Gate\r\nof Calais, and brought back suggestions of Hogarth's famous picture.\r\nIn more recent years, however, the restless spirit of modern\r\nimprovement has invaded even Quebec, and all, or nearly all, the\r\nancient gate-ways, the gate-ways of the days of Wolfe, have bowed to\r\nthe fate of Temple Bar.  Yet even to-day the traveller in Canada who\r\nstands upon that height may vividly recall the scene that lay before\r\nthe eyes of Wolfe during that memorable campaign.\r\n\r\nWolfe made an attempt to carry a battery above the Montmorency mouth,\r\nbut failed, and was repulsed with considerable loss.  He then cast\r\nabout him if it were possible to attack the town from the Heights of\r\nAbraham on the southern side.  It seemed on the face of it an\r\nimpossibility.  How was it possible for the attacking force to make its\r\nway unseen by the French up the precipitous cliffs to the Heights of\r\nAbraham?  Luckily, there was a young man in Wolfe's army, a Lieutenant\r\nMcCulloch, who had been held prisoner in Quebec in 1756.  With a view\r\nto future possibilities, he employed his time in surveying the cliffs,\r\nand he thought that he had discovered a particular spot where the steep\r\nhills might be successfully scaled by an attacking force.  He now\r\ncommunicated this to Wolfe.  Indeed, the idea of attack in this way\r\nseems to have been suggested by him, and on the memorable September\r\nnight the attempt was made.\r\n\r\n{289}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1759--Wolfe's tribute to literature]\r\n\r\nWho has not heard--who has not been touched and thrilled by the story\r\nof Wolfe, while being rowed across the spreading waters of the St.\r\nLawrence to the cove where the attempt was to be made, repeating in low\r\ntones to his officers near him Gray's \"Elegy in a Country Church-yard\"?\r\nWho does not remember Wolfe's famous saying that he would rather have\r\nwritten the Elegy than take Quebec?  It is a fine saying, akin to that\r\nof Caesar when he swore that he would rather be the first man in an\r\nobscure Italian village than the second man in Rome.  We may perhaps\r\ntake the liberty of questioning the absolute accuracy of either saying.\r\nIn Caesar's case he was, no doubt, sufficiently conscious that he was\r\ngoing to be the first man in Rome.  In Wolfe's case we may well believe\r\nthat his exquisite tribute to literature, and to the most charming work\r\nof one of the most charming men of letters then alive, was not meant\r\nvery seriously.  He was a soldier; Quebec was his duty; Quebec was to\r\nbe his fame.  But it is one of those sayings that live forever, and the\r\nmere thought of it at once calls up two widely different pictures,\r\npictures of places in two widely different parts of the world.  One\r\nshows the shining, swelling St. Lawrence River and the dead hour of\r\nnight, and those slowly moving boats of hushed heroes creeping across\r\nthe waters to where the mighty Quebec hills gloomed hugely out.  The\r\nother is of that quiet church-yard in England, at Stoke Pogis, near\r\nSlough, where pilgrims from many parts of the world still wander\r\nthrough the pleasant Buckinghamshire fields to stand where Gray\r\nconceived his Elegy.\r\n\r\nWolfe carried out his plan to perfection.  Day was dawning as the\r\nmajority of his forces formed upon the Heights of Abraham.  It was six\r\nin the morning before Montcalm's irregulars were upon the field, and\r\nnine o'clock before the French army was in position for action.  At ten\r\no'clock the battle began.  It did not last very long.  Whether the\r\nFrench were utterly disheartened or not by the appearance so\r\nunexpectedly of the {290} English on the ground, which they had deemed\r\nunassailable, certain is it that they made a poor fight of it.  Though\r\nthe French forces amounted to nearly double the English strength, the\r\nwhole battle, from the first French advance to their utter rout and\r\nflight, did not last a quarter of an hour.  It was one of the sharpest\r\nand the strangest battles in history.  Both sides lost their generals.\r\nMontcalm was killed; Wolfe, charging gallantly at the head of his men,\r\nfell mortally wounded.  The wild cry, \"They run!\" echoed in his dying\r\nears.  He seemed to recover a kind of alertness at the sound, and\r\nshaking himself from his deadly stupor, asked, \"Who run?\"  We can\r\nimagine the momentary trepidation in that gallant heart: could it be\r\nhis outnumbered followers?  In a moment he was reassured; it was the\r\nenemy who fled; with his last breath he gave some strategical orders,\r\nand then fell back.  \"God be praised, I die in peace,\" he said, and so\r\npassed away.  The time may, perhaps, come when the great game of war\r\nwill no longer stir the pulses, and men will no longer feel that they\r\ndie in peace after the bloody defeat of their enemies.  But so long as\r\nthe pulses of men's hearts do answer to any martial music, so long men\r\nwill say of Wolfe that he died well as became a soldier, a hero, and a\r\ngentleman.  He sleeps in Greenwich Church.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1759--An old French province]\r\n\r\nThe pride of England's colonial empire might find new stimulus in the\r\nway in which the memory of one of the most brilliant scenes in the\r\nstory of England's career is kept green in Quebec.  The traveller,\r\nstanding on Dufferin Terrace to-day, may in his mind's eye see Wolfe\r\ncrossing the stream on his perilous expedition, may in his mind's ear\r\nhear him reciting to his officers those lines from Gray's Elegy, and\r\ntelling them that he would rather have written such verses than be sure\r\nof taking Quebec.  His monument is near to the promenade on Dufferin\r\nTerrace--his monument which, a rare event in war, is the monument also\r\nof his rival, the French commander, Montcalm, killed in the hour of\r\ndefeat, as Wolfe was at the moment of victory.  Quebec itself seems to\r\nillustrate in {291} its own progress and its own history the moral of\r\nthat common monument.  Quebec is as loyal to the British Crown as\r\nVictoria or as the Channel Islands.  But it is still in great part an\r\nold-fashioned French city.  The France that survives there and all\r\nthrough the province is not the France of to-day, but the France of\r\nbefore the great Revolution.  The stranger seeking his way through the\r\nstreets had better, in most cases, question the first crossing-sweeper\r\nhe meets in French, and not in English.  The English residents are all\r\nexpected to speak French.  But the English residents and the French\r\nlive on terms of the most cordial fraternity.  Little quarrels, local\r\nquarrels of race and sect, do unquestionably spring up here and there\r\nnow and again, but they are only like the disputes of Churchmen and\r\nDissenters in an English city, and they threaten no organic\r\ncontroversy.  England has great reason to be proud of Quebec.  The\r\nEnglish flag has a home on those heights which we have already said may\r\nchallenge the world for bold picturesqueness and beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{292}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nTHE CLOSE OF THE REIGN.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1684-1753--Berkeley]\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the year 1753 literature and philosophy lost a\r\ngreat man by the death of Bishop Berkeley.\r\n\r\nGeorge Berkeley was born on March 12, 1684, by the Nore, in the county\r\nKilkenny.  His father was an Irishman of English descent, William\r\nBerkeley.  In the first year of the eighteenth century George Berkeley\r\nwent, a lad of fifteen, to the University of Dublin, to Trinity\r\nCollege.  In Trinity College he remained for thirteen years, studying,\r\nthinking, dreaming, bewildering most of the collegians, his colleagues,\r\nwho seemed to have been unable to make up their minds whether he was a\r\ngenius or a blockhead.  Within the walls of Trinity he worked,\r\ngradually and laboriously piecing together and thoughtfully shaping out\r\nhis theory of the metaphysical conception of the material world about\r\nhim; poring over Locke and Plato, breathing an atmosphere saturated\r\nwith Cartesianism, his active mind eagerly investigating, exploring,\r\ninquiring in all directions, and his hand recording day by day the\r\nnotes and stages of his mental development.\r\n\r\nHis early philosophical writings rapidly earned him a reputation in the\r\ngreat world of London, to which at that time the eyes of all\r\nmen--divines, wits, statesmen, philosophers, and poets--turned.  It is\r\nnot necessary here to dwell upon the nature of those philosophical\r\nwritings, or to enter into any study of the great theory of idealism in\r\nwhich he affirmed that there is no proof of the existence of matter\r\nanywhere save in our own perceptions.  Byron, in his light-hearted way,\r\nmore than two generations later, dismissed Bishop Berkeley and his\r\ntheory in the famous couplet--\r\n\r\n{293}\r\n\r\n  \"When Bishop Berkeley said there is no matter,\r\n  It clearly was no matter what he said\"\r\n\r\n--a smart saying which Byron did not intend to put forth, and which\r\nnobody would be likely to regard, as a serious summing up of the mental\r\nwork of Berkeley.\r\n\r\nBerkeley came to London in the first winter month of 1713, and made the\r\nacquaintance of his great countryman Swift.  The Dean was a great\r\npatron of Berkeley's in those early London days.  Swift took Berkeley\r\nto Court, and introduced him or spoke of him to all the great\r\nministers, and pushed his fortunes by all the ways--and they were\r\nmany--in his power.  Berkeley, with the aid of Swift, was soon made\r\nfree of that wonderful republic of letters which then held sway in\r\nLondon, and which numbered among its members such men as Steele and\r\nAddison, Bolingbroke and Harley, Gay and Arbuthnot, and Pope.  Berkeley\r\nwas in Addison's box at the first performance of \"Cato,\" and tasted of\r\nthe author's champagne and burgundy there, and listened with curious\r\ndelight to the mingled applause and hisses that greeted Mr. Pope's\r\nprologue.  A little later Berkeley went to Italy as the travelling\r\ntutor, the bear-leader, of the son of Ashe, Bishop of Clogher.  In\r\nItaly he passed some four enchanted years.\r\n\r\nBerkeley came back to England in 1720 to find all England writhing in\r\nthe welter and chaos of the South Sea crash.  The shame and misery of\r\nthe time appear to have inspired him with a kind of horror of the\r\nhollow civilization of the age, and to have given him his first\r\npromptings towards that ideal community in the remote Atlantic to which\r\nhis mind turned so strongly a little later.  He left England speedily,\r\nand came home again to Ireland after an absence of eight years.  It was\r\nin Ireland that a strange windfall came to him and amazed him.  On that\r\nfatal afternoon when Swift, with a legion of wild passions tearing at\r\nhis heartstrings, rode over to Marley Abbey to fling back at Vanessa's\r\nfeet the letter she had written to Stella, Hester Vanhomrigh received\r\n{294} her death-blow.  But she lived long enough to inflict a curious\r\nlittle piece of vengeance, the only vengeance in her power, except the\r\nnobler revenge of forgiveness, upon the false Cadenus.  She had left by\r\nwill all the property she possessed to the man she had so madly\r\nworshipped.  With the hand of Death upon her, with the raging eyes of\r\nthe Dean still burning upon her brain, she performed the one little\r\npitiful act of retaliation which is the saddest spot in all her sad\r\nhistory; she altered her will, and disinherited her idol.  For the name\r\nof Jonathan Swift, Dean of St. Patrick's, she substituted the name of\r\nanother great Irishman, another great Churchman, another great thinker\r\nand teacher, the name of George Berkeley, Dean--only nominally so,\r\nindeed--of Dromore.  Berkeley's first idea on receiving this unexpected\r\nwindfall was to employ the money thus almost miraculously placed at his\r\ndisposal in carrying out a scheme which had long been dear to his\r\nheart.  This scheme was that he should emigrate to Bermuda, should\r\nsettle there, and devote the rest of his life to \"the reformation of\r\nmanners among the English in our Western plantations, and the\r\npropagation of the Gospel among the American savages.\"  He was nobly\r\nconvinced of the nobility of his dream, and, which was more remarkable,\r\nhe succeeded in awaking a latent nobility in unexpected places, and in\r\narousing an enthusiasm for this dream of a Bermudan Utopia even in\r\ncallous hearts and unsympathetic bosoms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1728--Berkeley's aspirations]\r\n\r\nBermuda became for a while the fashion in the marvellous medley of\r\nLondon society over which the first of the Georges reigned.  People\r\ntalked Bermuda, thought Bermuda, wrote Bermuda.  He was indeed a\r\nremarkable man whose missionary zeal and eloquence could make Bermuda\r\npopular in London with the voice of religion.  He was indeed a\r\nremarkable man who could impress for a moment the cynical nature of\r\nBolingbroke with something of the fire of his own enthusiasm; who could\r\ninduce Walpole to swell from his own pocket the subscription-list that\r\nwas raised to further Berkeley's schemes; {295} who actually succeeded\r\nin touching the callous organism which the Elector of Hanover and King\r\nof England called a heart; and whose one joy on hearing of the Vanessa\r\nlegacy was at the aid it afforded to his voyage and his pure, unselfish\r\naspirations.  Bermuda ever remained a vision for him; but in 1728 he\r\nset sail for Rhode Island in the company of his young wife, Miss Anne\r\nForster, whom, as he quaintly tells us, he chose \"for her qualities of\r\nmind and her unaffected inclination to books.\"  For more than three\r\nyears he dwelt in America a simple, happy, earnest life.  But the\r\nmission was a failure.  To Robert Walpole, Berkeley's plans and hopes\r\nwould naturally seem about as deserving of the attention and aid of\r\npractical men as the ambitions of Don Quixote.  The grant promised by\r\nthe Government was never sent out, and in 1731 Berkeley came back to\r\nEngland.  How many of those who are familiar with the line, \"Westward\r\nthe course of empire takes its way,\" which has been accepted as the\r\nmotto for one of the best and best-known frescos that adorn the Capitol\r\nin Washington, know that it comes from the last verse of a poem which\r\nBerkeley wrote as he was striving to realize a New Atlantis in Rhode\r\nIsland?\r\n\r\n  \"Westward the course of empire takes its way;\r\n    The first four acts already past,\r\n  A fifth shall close the drama with the day;\r\n    Time's noblest offspring is the last.\"\r\n\r\nTwo years of literary and philosophic life in London succeeded to the\r\nRhode Island idyl.  In 1734 he returned to Ireland for the last time,\r\nand dwelt for eighteen years in his bishopric of Cloyne in studious\r\nseclusion with his family, wandering among the myrtle-hedges his own\r\nhand planted, reading Plato and Hooker, teaching his cherished\r\ndaughter, suffering from domestic losses, and proclaiming to an\r\nastounded world that tar-water was a panacea for all human ills.\r\nBerkeley's genius and his eloquent prose made tar-water as popular as\r\nboth had {296} made Bermuda some twenty years earlier.  The later years\r\nof his life at Cloyne are tinged with melancholy.  His mind began to be\r\nagitated anew with the dream of an academic retreat by other streams\r\nthan the Blackwater and the Leo, and in 1752 he journeyed again to\r\nEngland and set up his tent for the last time beneath the shadow of the\r\nOxford spires.  It was mellow autumn when he came to the City of\r\nScholars.  In the chill January weather of the following year he died\r\nsuddenly and peacefully in the midst of his family.  He was a great and\r\na good man.  The serene purity of his life, his lofty purposes, his\r\nnobility of nature, cause him to stand out very conspicuously in the\r\nstrange, cynical, cruel world of English life and English thought\r\nduring the first half of the eighteenth century.  He was in that world,\r\nbut he was never of it.  His friends were either noble of life and\r\nmind, or else he saw in them only their nobler qualities, and took no\r\nthought of or no harm from the rest.  He seems to have been most\r\nhappy--and the fact is characteristic of the man--in the society of the\r\nsweet, simple, and studious woman who made him a loving wife, and of\r\nthe children whom he loved with an affection for the excess of which he\r\nsometimes reproached himself.  All his contemporaries, says Sir James\r\nMackintosh, agreed with Pope in ascribing\r\n\r\n  \"To Berkeley every virtue under heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1754 Henry Pelham died.  The important consequence of his death was\r\nthe fact that it gave Pitt at last an opportunity of coming to the\r\nfront.  The Duke of Newcastle, Henry Pelham's brother, became leader of\r\nthe administration, with Henry Fox for Secretary at War, Pitt for\r\nPaymaster-general of the Forces, and Murray, afterwards to be famous as\r\nLord Mansfield, for Attorney-general.  There was some difficulty about\r\nthe leadership of the House of Commons.  Pitt was still too much\r\ndisliked by the King to be available for the position.  Fox for a while\r\nrefused to accept it, and Murray was unwilling {297} to do anything\r\nwhich might be likely to withdraw him from the professional path along\r\nwhich he was to move to such distinction.  An attempt was made to get\r\non with a Sir Thomas Robinson, a man of no capacity for such a\r\nposition, and the attempt was soon an evident failure.  Then Fox\r\nconsented to take the position on Newcastle's own terms, which were\r\nthose of absolute submission to the dictates of Newcastle.  Later still\r\nhe was content to descend to a subordinate office which did not even\r\ngive him a place in the Cabinet.  Fox never recovered the damage which\r\nhis reputation and his influence suffered by this amazing act; the only\r\nexplanation for which was found in the fact that he loved money better\r\nthan anything in the world, and that the office of Paymaster-general\r\ngave almost limitless opportunities to a rapacious and unscrupulous man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1757--Admiral Byng]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Newcastle's Ministry soon fell.  Newcastle was not a man\r\nwho had the slightest capacity for controlling or directing a policy of\r\nwar; and the great struggle known as the Seven Years' War had now\r\nbroken out.  One lamentable event in the war has to be recorded,\r\nalthough it was but of minor importance.  This was the capture of\r\nMinorca by the French under the romantic, gallant, and profligate Duc\r\nde Richelieu.  The event is memorable chiefly, or only, because it was\r\nfollowed by the trial and execution of the unfortunate Admiral Byng.\r\nAdmiral Byng, the son of a famous sailor, was sent in command of a\r\nsmall and a very poorly furnished squadron to the Mediterranean to\r\nrelieve Minorca.  When he readied Gibraltar he found that a French\r\nfleet much superior in numbers to his own was blockading the island he\r\nwas sent to relieve.  Byng called a council of war, and the council\r\ndecided that, as they had no instructions from home how to act in the\r\nevent of their finding themselves face to face with a superior force,\r\nthey had better not interfere with the doings of the enemy.  Still Byng\r\nmade for Minorca, and tried unsuccessfully to open communications with\r\nthe garrison.  He had a slight engagement {298} with the French, and\r\nthen he brought his squadron away.  The news created such an outburst\r\nof passion in England that the Duke of Newcastle made up his mind at\r\nonce to sacrifice Byng to the popular fury.  Byng was tried at\r\nSpithead, found guilty of having failed in his duty, and shot on March\r\n14, 1757.  He died like a brave man.  It went heavily against Newcastle\r\nin later days that he was believed to have promised the sacrifice of\r\nByng before the trial had even begun.  No one now believes that Byng\r\nwas a coward; and nothing but a miracle could have enabled him with\r\nsuch a force to save Minorca.  But he failed sadly in his duty, whether\r\nfrom stupidity or irresolution, and probably he would not have cared to\r\noutlive his degradation.  The punishment was stern and harsh indeed,\r\nbut it was a time to excuse sternness on the part of a government on\r\nwhom had fallen the conduct of a great war.  Pitt did his best to\r\ninduce the King to mitigate the penalty in accordance with the\r\nunanimous recommendation of the court-martial; but George was\r\ninflexible, and reminded Pitt that he had himself taught the Sovereign\r\nto seek outside the House of Commons for the judgment of the English\r\npeople.  It was to the execution of Byng that Voltaire applied the\r\nfamous epigram, \"In England it is thought necessary to kill an admiral\r\nfrom time to time to encourage the others\"--\"_pour encourager les\r\nautres_.\"  Voltaire tried hard to save Byng, and even induced the Duc\r\nde Richelieu to write a letter bearing his personal testimony to the\r\nunfortunate admiral's courage.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Newcastle resigned office, and for a short time the Duke of\r\nDevonshire was at the head of a coalition Ministry which included Pitt.\r\nThe King, however, did not stand this long, and one day suddenly turned\r\nthem all out of office.  Then a coalition of another kind was formed,\r\nwhich included Newcastle and Pitt, with Henry Fox in the subordinate\r\nposition of paymaster.  Pitt now for the first time had it all his own\r\nway.  He ruled everything in the House of Commons.  He flung himself\r\nwith passionate and patriotic energy into the {299} alliance with that\r\ngreat Frederick whose genius and daring were like his own.  Pitt was a\r\nheaven-born war-minister.  His courage and his resources changed the\r\nwhole fortunes of the war.  He seemed a statesman to organize victory.\r\nHe stirred up the languishing patriotism of the hour, and filled it\r\nwith new and noble inspiration.  It was true what George had said to\r\nhim--that he had taught, or tried to teach, the Sovereign to seek\r\noutside the House of Commons for the voice of the English people.  But\r\nthis was to the honor of Pitt, and not to his discredit.  Pitt saw that\r\na legislature returned on such a representation could be no spokesman\r\nof the English people.  He knew that intelligence and education were\r\nbeginning to spread with increased wealth through large unrepresented\r\nclasses, and even communities.  While he had the people behind him he\r\ncared little for the Sovereign, and still less for the House of\r\nCommons.  His pride was as great as his patriotism; he might be broken,\r\nbut he could not bend.  At last he had found his true place--at the\r\nhead of a great nation and during a grand national crisis.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1757--Sterne]\r\n\r\nThe closing years of George's reign were honored by some literary\r\ntriumphs in which George himself could have taken but little interest.\r\nIn 1755 appeared, in two volumes folio, the English Dictionary by\r\nSamuel Johnson.  We shall meet with Samuel Johnson a good deal in the\r\nfuture course of this history, and have now only to mention as a fact\r\nthe publication of the work on which he himself believed his fame was\r\nto rest.  Another work of a very different kind and by a very different\r\nsort of man appeared in 1759--the first and second volume of \"Tristram\r\nShandy,\" by Laurence Sterne.\r\n\r\nSeldom, perhaps, has an author experienced a stranger bringing up than\r\nthat which fell to the lot of Sterne.  His father, Roger Sterne, was\r\none of those luckless persons who seem to be the especial sport of a\r\nmalicious destiny, in whose hands nothing prospers, from whose hands\r\nthievish Fortune filches all opportunities.  Roger Sterne was a\r\ngentleman of good family and narrow means, who {300} had adopted arms\r\nas his profession and had not prospered therein.  He had married a wife\r\nwho was herself a sutler's widow, and who blessed Ensign Sterne with a\r\nswift and steady succession of offspring, of whom Laurence was the\r\nsecond.  It was chance, acting through the impulses of the War Office,\r\nwhich caused little Laurence to see the light on Irish soil; but though\r\nhe was born in the melodiously named Valley of Honey, there was little\r\nof honeyed sweetness, and much bitterness as of gall and coloquintida,\r\nin his early boyhood.  Poverty and the eccentric evolutions of a\r\nmarching regiment contributed to make his a most unenviable childhood.\r\nThe record, as we can read it in his own account, is disastrous and\r\ndreary enough.  The regiment to which Roger Sterne belonged was\r\nperpetually on the move; the births and deaths of Mrs. Sterne's\r\nchildren succeeded each other with painful rapidity; again and again\r\nwas little Laurence in imminent peril of shipwreck on the stormiest\r\nseas; he experienced in his earliest years all that was worst and most\r\ndisagreeable in the life of camp-followers.  Some account must\r\nnecessarily be taken of this by those who review Sterne's writings.  A\r\nchild brought up under such conditions is not likely to have a very\r\nkeen appreciation of the finer phases of life, and must inevitably have\r\na precocious and most unfortunate familiarity with the seamy side of\r\nexistence.  What is commonly called knowledge of the world, which means\r\nknowledge of what is worst in the world, as \"seeing life\" generally\r\nmeans seeing its dirtiest places, undoubtedly Sterne got in plenty, and\r\nthe future divine was not improved by the education of the camp.\r\n\r\nThe misfortunes that had attended so persistently upon the career of\r\nRoger Sterne culminated at last most tragically, yet at the same time\r\nmost ludicrously, as if Destiny had determined to the end to make the\r\nluckless ensign her sport.  At Gibraltar a quarrel with another officer\r\n\"about a goose\" resulted in a duel.  Roger Sterne was run through the\r\nbody.  He never recovered from the wound, and though in this harsh\r\nworld he drew his breath {301} in pain a little longer, he died in\r\nJamaica of fever, which found his enfeebled frame a ready victim.  One\r\nof the few pleasing characteristics in Laurence Sterne's nature is his\r\naffectionate memory of his father; one of the most pleasing passages of\r\nall his writings is that in which he describes him.  \"My father was a\r\nlittle, smart man, active to the last degree in all exercises, most\r\npatient of fatigue and disappointment, of which it had pleased God to\r\ngive him full measure.  He was, in his temper, somewhat rapid and\r\nhasty\"--hence, no doubt, the speaking of hot words and the spilling of\r\nhot blood over that ill-omened goose--\"but of a kindly, sweet\r\ndisposition, void of all design, and so innocent in his intentions that\r\nhe suspected no one, so that you might have cheated him ten times a day\r\nif nine had not been sufficient for your purpose.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1713-1768--\"Tristram Shandy\"]\r\n\r\nThrough Halifax School and Cambridge sizarship Laurence Sterne passed,\r\nby the patronage of his pluralist uncle, Jacques Sterne, into holy\r\norders and the living of Sutton-on-the-Forest, and so into twenty years\r\nof almost complete obscurity.  We know that he married, that he\r\npreached, played the fiddle, fished, hunted, and read, and that is\r\nabout all we know.  Then quite suddenly, in 1759, the lazy, lounging,\r\nmost eccentric, and ill-chosen clergyman enraptured London by the\r\npublication of the first two volumes of \"Tristram Shandy.\"\r\n\r\nThe author of \"Tristram Shandy\" came to town, and was received with\r\nmore than Roman triumph.  Wealth, wit, genius, nobility, thronged his\r\ndoor, sought his friendship, proffered favors.  Sterne revelled in this\r\nnew life.  London offered him a cup of the most intoxicating quality,\r\nand he drank and drank again of its sparkling fountain without ever\r\nquenching his thirst for popularity, for flattery, for success.\r\nFlattery, popularity, success--all three he had in plenty for eight\r\nresplendent years.  Volume after volume of \"Tristram Shandy\" wooed and\r\nwon public applause.  Sterne travelled abroad and found the same\r\nadulation in other capitals of Europe that he had enjoyed in London.\r\nWhen the popularity of \"Shandy\" {302} appeared to be on the wane, and\r\nthe fame of its author to be dwindling, he whipped it up again with the\r\n\"Sentimental Journey.\"  We may finish his story by anticipation.  He\r\ndied one of the most tragic deaths recorded in the necrology of genius.\r\nHe died in London on March 18, 1768, and he died alone.  The wish he\r\nhad expressed of expiring at an inn untroubled by the presence of\r\nmourning friends was grimly gratified.  In lonely lodgings, beneath the\r\nspeculative gaze of a memoir-writing footman and the care of hired\r\nhands, Sterne gasped out the words, \"Now it is come!\" and so died.  He\r\nwas buried almost unattended, and his body was stolen from its new-made\r\ngrave by resurrectionists, and recognized, when half-dissected, on an\r\nanatomist's table by a horrified friend.  So the story goes--not,\r\nindeed, absolutely authentic, but certainly not absolutely without\r\ncredit--the melancholy conclusion of an ill-spent life and a splendid,\r\nill-used intellect.\r\n\r\nFor his conduct to his wife his memory has been scourged by Thackeray\r\nand by his latest biographer, Mr. H. D. Traill.  It cannot be too\r\nseverely scourged.  He took her youth, he took her money, and he tired\r\nof her, and was untrue to her, and spoke against her in the dastardly\r\nletters he wrote to his friends and in which he has gibbeted himself to\r\nall time as a hideous warning, a sort of sentimental scarecrow.  \"As to\r\nthe nature of Sterne's love affairs,\" says Mr. Traill, \"I have come,\r\nthough not without hesitation, to the conclusion that they were most,\r\nif not all of them, what is called, somewhat absurdly, platonic. . . .\r\nBut as I am not one of those who hold that the conventionally\r\n'innocent' is the equivalent of the morally harmless in this matter, I\r\ncannot regard the question as worth any very minute investigation.  I\r\nam not sure that the habitual male flirt, who neglects his wife to sit\r\ncontinually languishing at the feet of some other woman, gives much\r\nless pain and scandal to others or does much less mischief to himself\r\nand the objects of his adoration than the thorough-going profligate.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest of German writers, Jean Paul Richter, {303}\r\ndeclares more than once that he regards Sterne as his master.  The\r\nstatement is amazing.  Jean Paul Richter, Jean Paul the Only One, as he\r\nwas fondly called, was immeasurably sincerer than his master.  All that\r\nwas sham, tinsel, and tawdry in the writings of Yorick was genuine,\r\nheart-felt, and soul-inspiring in Jean Paul.  Yorick's sentiment was\r\npinchbeck; Jean Paul's was pure gold.  All that Richter ever wrote is\r\nanimated with the deepest religious feeling, the tenderest sympathy,\r\nthe gentlest and bravest pity.  Yorick, in the black and white of his\r\nsacred calling's gown and bands, grins and leers like a disguised\r\nsatyr.  His morality is a mummer's mask; his pathos is pretence; the\r\nonly thing truly Irish about him is his humor, his ceaseless wit, the\r\nunfailing sparkle of his fancy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1760--A levée under difficulties]\r\n\r\nQuite suddenly the ghastly tragicomedy of the King's life came to an\r\nend.  There was, we are told, a strange affectation of an incapacity to\r\nbe sick that ran through the whole royal family, which they carried so\r\nfar that few of them were more willing to own any other member of the\r\nfamily ill than to acknowledge themselves to be so.  \"I have known the\r\nKing,\" says Hervey, \"get out of his bed choking with a sore throat, and\r\nin a high fever, only to dress and have a levée, and in five minutes\r\nundress and return to his bed till the same ridiculous farce of health\r\nwas to be presented the next day at the same hour.\"  It must be owned,\r\nhowever, that George made a stout fight against ill-health, and if he\r\nshammed being well, he kept up the sham for a good long time.  He came\r\ninto the world more than a dozen years before Lord Hervey was born, and\r\nhe contrived to keep his place in it for some seventeen years after\r\nLord Hervey had died.  Time had nearly come round with George as with\r\nShakespeare's Cassius; his death fell very near to his birthday.\r\nGeorge was born on October 30, 1683, and on October 25, 1760, he was on\r\nthe verge of completing his seventy-seventh year.  On October 25, 1760,\r\nhe woke early, as was his custom, drank his chocolate, inquired as to\r\nthe quarter whence the wind came, and talked of a walk in the {304}\r\ngarden.  That walk in the garden was never taken.  The page who\r\nattended on the King had left the room.  He heard a groan and the sound\r\nof a fall.  [Sidenote: 1727-1760--Passed away] He came back, and found\r\nthe King a helpless heap upon the floor.  \"Call Amelia,\" the dying man\r\ngasped; but before Amelia could be called he was dead.  Amelia, when\r\nshe came, being a little deaf, did not grasp at once the full extent of\r\nwhat had happened, and bent over her father only to learn in the most\r\nstartling and shocking manner that her father was dead.  The Countess\r\nof Walmoden, too, was sent for.  It would seem as if the ample charms\r\nof the Countess of Walmoden, which had delighted George so much while\r\nhe lived, might have some power to conjure him back from the common\r\ndoom of kings.  But George the Second was dead beyond the power of all\r\nthe fat and painted women in the world to help.  \"Friends,\" says\r\nThackeray in his Essay, \"he was your fathers' king as well as mine; let\r\nus drop a respectful tear over his grave.\"  But indeed it is very hard\r\nto drop a respectful tear over the grave of George the Second.  Seldom\r\nhas any man been a king with fewer kingly qualities.  He had courage,\r\nundoubtedly--courage enough to be habitually described by the Jacobites\r\nas \"the Captain,\" but his courage was the courage of a captain and not\r\nof a king.  He was obstinate, he was narrow-minded, he was selfish, he\r\nwas repulsively and even ridiculously incontinent.  The usual quantity\r\nof base and servile adulation was poured over the Royal coffin.  The\r\nsame abject creatures--they or their kind--that had rhymed their lying\r\nverses over the dead Prince of Wales who had hated his father, now\r\nrhymed their lying verses over the dead king who had hated his son.  If\r\nGeorge the Second had been a more common man, instead of being Elector\r\nof Hanover and King of England, one might have said of him frankly\r\nenough that he was a person about as little to be admired as a man well\r\ncould be who was not a coward or in the ordinary sense of the term a\r\ncriminal.  But because he was a crowned king, it was regarded as a\r\npatriotic duty then to make much of the {305} departed monarch, and to\r\ntalk of him in the strain which would have been appropriate if he had\r\nbeen a Marcus Aurelius.  The best, perhaps, that can be said of him is\r\nthat, on the whole, all things considered, he might have been worse.\r\nIt would be unfair to a George who has, at a long interval, to succeed\r\nhim, to say that George the Second was actually the worst of his line\r\nand name; but he was so little, so very little, worthy, that the\r\nfulsome pens must have labored in his praise.  If many people rejoiced\r\nat his removal, it would be hard to say who grieved with the exception\r\nof a few, a select few, of his family and the hangers-on of the\r\nWalmoden type, to whom his existence was the essential figure in their\r\nown existence.  To the vast bulk of the English people the matter was\r\nof no moment whatever.  All that they knew was that a second George,\r\nwho was Elector of Hanover, had passed away from the English throne,\r\nand that a third George, who was Elector of Hanover, had mounted into\r\nthe vacant seat.\r\n\r\nNever was a king better served than George the Second; never had so\r\nignoble a sovereign such men to make his kingdom strong and his reign\r\nfamous.  He began his time of royalty under the protection of the\r\nsturdy figure of Walpole; he closed it under the protection of the\r\nstately form of Pitt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF THE SECOND VOLUME.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{306}\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abernethy, Dr., death, iv. 282.\r\n  Act for better securing the Dependency of Ireland, i. 177.\r\n  Act of Settlement, i. 4.\r\n  Act of Union passed, iii. 327, 330.\r\n  Acts of Trade, iii. 82, 84, 86, 105.\r\n  Adams, John:\r\n    Conduct towards Colonel Preston, iii. 152.\r\n    Opposes dominion of England, iii. 85.\r\n  Adams, Samuel, protests against Stamp Act, iii. 90.\r\n  Addington, Henry, Viscount Sidmouth, Prime Minister, iii. 337.\r\n  Addison, Joseph:\r\n    M.
