Of the Limits to the Explanation of Laws of Nature; and of Hypotheses.\r\n§ 1. \tCan all the sequences in nature be resolvable into one law? \t3\r\n2. \tUltimate laws cannot be less numerous than the distinguishable feelings of our nature \t4\r\n3. \tIn what sense ultimate facts can be explained \t7\r\n4. \tThe proper use of scientific hypotheses \t8\r\n5. \tTheir indispensableness \t16\r\n6. \tLegitimate, how distinguished from illegitimate hypotheses \t18\r\n7. \tSome inquiries apparently hypothetical are really inductive \t25\r\n\r\nChapter XV. Of Progressive Effects; and of the Continued Action of Causes.\r\n§ 1. \tHow a progressive effect results from the simple continuance of the cause \t29\r\n2. \t—and from the progressiveness of the cause \t33\r\n3. \tDerivative laws generated from a single ultimate law \t36\r\n\r\nChapter XVI. Of Empirical Laws.\r\n§ 1. \tDefinition of an empirical law \t38\r\n2. \tDerivative laws commonly depend on collocations \t39\r\n3. \tThe collocations of the permanent causes are not reducible to any law \t41\r\n[Pg vi]4. \tHence empirical laws cannot be relied on beyond the limits of actual experience \t41\r\n5. \tGeneralizations which rest only on the Method of Agreement can only be received as empirical laws \t43\r\n6. \tSigns from which an observed uniformity of sequence may be presumed to be resolvable \t44\r\n7. \tTwo kinds of empirical laws \t47\r\n\r\nChapter XVII. Of Chance, and its Elimination.\r\n§ 1. \tThe proof of empirical laws depends on the theory of chance \t49\r\n2. \tChance defined and characterized \t50\r\n3. \tThe elimination of chance \t55\r\n4. \tDiscovery of residual phenomena by eliminating chance \t57\r\n5. \tThe doctrine of chances \t59\r\n\r\nChapter XVIII.

Of the Extension of Derivative Laws to Adjacent Cases.\r\n§ 1. \tDerivative laws, when not casual, are almost always contingent on collocations \t78\r\n2. \tOn what grounds they can be extended to cases beyond the bounds of actual experience \t80\r\n3. \tThose cases must be adjacent cases \t82\r\n\r\nChapter XX.

Of the Evidence of the Law of Universal Causation.\r\n§ 1. \tThe law of causality does not rest on an instinct \t95\r\n2. \tBut on an induction by simple enumeration \t100\r\n3. \tIn what cases such induction is allowable \t102\r\n4. \tThe universal prevalence of the law of causality, on what grounds admissible \t105\r\n\r\nChapter XXII. Of Uniformities of Coexistence not dependent on Causation.\r\n§ 1. \tUniformities of coexistence which result from laws of sequence \t110\r\n2. \tThe properties of Kinds are uniformities of coexistence \t111\r\n3. \tSome are derivative, others ultimate \t113\r\n4. \tNo universal axiom of coexistence \t114\r\n5. \tThe evidence of uniformities of coexistence, how measured \t117\r\n6. \tWhen derivative, their evidence is that of empirical laws \t117\r\n7. \tSo also when ultimate \t119\r\n8. \tThe evidence stronger in proportion as the law is more general \t120\r\n9. \tEvery distinct Kind must be examined \t121\r\n\r\nChapter XXIII. Of Approximate Generalizations, and Probable Evidence.\r\n§ 1. \tThe inferences called probable, rest on approximate generalizations \t124\r\n2. \tApproximate generalizations less useful in science than in life \t124\r\n3. \tIn what cases they may be resorted to \t126\r\n4. \tIn what manner proved \t127\r\n5. \tWith what precautions employed \t130\r\n6. \tThe two modes of combining probabilities \t131\r\n7. \tHow approximate generalizations may be converted into accurate generalizations equivalent to them \t136\r\n[Pg viii]\r\nChapter XXIV. Of the Remaining Laws of Nature.\r\n§ 1. \tPropositions which assert mere existence \t139\r\n2. \tResemblance, considered as a subject of science \t141\r\n3. \tThe axioms and theorems of mathematics comprise the principal laws of resemblance \t143\r\n4. \t—and those of order in place, and rest on induction by simple enumeration \t145\r\n5. \tThe propositions of arithmetic affirm the modes of formation of some given number \t146\r\n6. \tThose of algebra affirm the equivalence of different modes of formation of numbers generally \t151\r\n7. \tThe propositions of geometry are laws of outward nature \t154\r\n8. \tWhy geometry is almost entirely deductive \t156\r\n9. \tFunction of mathematical truths in the other sciences, and limits of that function \t158\r\n\r\nChapter XXV. Of the Grounds of Disbelief.\r\n§ 1. \tImprobability and impossibility \t161\r\n2. \tExamination of Hume's doctrine of miracles \t162\r\n3. \tThe degrees of improbability correspond to differences in the nature of the generalization with which an assertion conflicts \t166\r\n4. \tA fact is not incredible because the chances are against it \t170\r\n5. \tAre coincidences less credible than other facts? \t172\r\n6. \tAn opinion of Laplace examined \t175\r\n\r\nBOOK IV.\r\nOF OPERATIONS SUBSIDIARY TO INDUCTION.\r\n\r\nChapter I. Of Observation and Description.\r\n§ 1. \tObservation, how far a subject of logic \t183\r\n2. \tA great part of what seems observation is really inference \t184\r\n3. \tThe description of an observation affirms more than is contained in the observation \t187\r\n4. \t—namely an agreement among phenomena; and the comparison of phenomena to ascertain such agreements is a preliminary to induction \t190\r\n[Pg ix]\r\nChapter II. Of Abstraction, or the Formation of Conceptions.\r\n§ 1. \tThe comparison which is a preliminary to induction implies general conceptions \t193\r\n2. \t—but these need not be pre-existent \t194\r\n3. \tA general conception, originally the result of a comparison, becomes itself the type of comparison \t198\r\n4. \tWhat is meant by appropriate conceptions \t200\r\n5. \t—and by clear conceptions \t203\r\n6. \tFurther illustration of the subject \t205\r\n\r\nChapter III. Of Naming, as subsidiary to Induction.\r\n§ 1. \tThe fundamental property of names as an instrument of thought \t209\r\n2. \tNames are not indispensable to induction \t210\r\n3. \tIn what manner subservient to it \t211\r\n4. \tGeneral names not a mere contrivance to economize the use of language \t213\r\n\r\nChapter IV. Of the Requisites of a Philosophical Language, and the Principles of Definition.\r\n§ 1. \tFirst requisite of philosophical language, a steady and determinate meaning for every general name \t215\r\n2. \tNames in common use have often a loose connotation \t215\r\n3. \t—which the logician should fix, with as little alteration as possible \t218\r\n4. \tWhy definition is often a question not of words but of things \t220\r\n5. \tHow the logician should deal with the transitive applications of words \t224\r\n6. \tEvil consequences of casting off any portion of the customary connotation of words \t229\r\n[Pg x]\r\nChapter V. On the Natural History of the Variations in the Meaning of Terms.\r\n§ 1. \tHow circumstances originally accidental become incorporated into the meaning of words \t236\r\n2. \t—and sometimes become the whole meaning \t238\r\n3. \tTendency of words to become generalized \t240\r\n4. \t—and to become specialized \t243\r\n\r\nChapter VI.

Of Classification by Series.\r\n§ 1. \tNatural groups should be arranged in a natural series \t284\r\n2. \tThe arrangement should follow the degrees of the main phenomenon \t285\r\n3. \t—which implies the assumption of a type-species \t287\r\n[Pg xi]4. \tHow the divisions of the series should be determined \t288\r\n5. \tZoology affords the completest type of scientific classification \t289\r\n\r\nBOOK V.\r\nON FALLACIES.\r\n\r\nChapter I.
