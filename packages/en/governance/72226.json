BELDEN’S ESTABLISHMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe establishment of Dr. James Belden was pleasantly situated upon the\r\nsouthern shore of Long Island, some ninety odd miles from the city. The\r\nspacious house was fitted with every modern convenience and comfort,\r\nand stood in extensive, well-wooded private grounds. There were good\r\nfishing and boating to be had and the white, well-kept Long Island\r\nroads afforded excellent facilities alike for riding and driving.\r\n\r\nThe establishment was in reality a cross between a sanatorium and a\r\nphysical culture resort. The doctor-proprietor carefully examined\r\neach person upon arrival and kept his directing eye upon him during\r\nhis stay. He prescribed the diet and the exercise suited to each case\r\nand saw to it personally that his instructions were carried out.\r\nMany a wreck of the city’s storm and stress had the Doctor sent back\r\nto the metropolis renovated and renewed, and many were the haggard\r\ndevotees of late hours and city dissipation who had returned, after\r\na sojourn at the retreat, with vigor in their limbs and the hue of\r\nhealth in their cheeks. In a word, the Doctor was a philanthropist,\r\nat a hundred a week, who extended a haven of rest for human wrecks\r\nand turned them out again on the high seas of life staunchly refitted\r\nto renew the struggle. The Doctor himself, in fact, often referred\r\nto his establishment as a haven of refuge, which nautical expression\r\nwas, perhaps, not inapt, inasmuch as the harbor in question was\r\nnot infrequently visited, in popular parlance, by “swells” and\r\n“high-rollers.”\r\n\r\nDr. Belden himself was an exceedingly genial person, who well knew how\r\nto keep his various guests amused and in good humor with themselves\r\nand the world in general. The one subject which disturbed the Doctor’s\r\nequanimity was the presence in the neighborhood of a recently\r\nestablished private asylum for the insane maintained by a Dr. Weldon.\r\nThe similarity between the names Weldon and Belden had led upon certain\r\noccasions to various distressing and distinctly embarrassing mistakes.\r\nThus, when distinguished visitors had at times mentioned that they\r\nwere staying at Dr. Belden’s establishment, rustics of the neighboring\r\nvillages had been known to tap their heads significantly and adopt\r\neither attitudes of alarm, or patronizing airs, as the case might be.\r\nWhile little Reggie Smithers had been sojourning at Dr. Belden’s the\r\nrumor had been circulated at his club that he was incarcerated in\r\nan asylum for lunatics and a friendly wag had written him a letter\r\nof condolence, in which he took occasion to remark parenthetically\r\nthat he had always entertained an innate conviction that Reggie would\r\neventually so wind up, at which Reggie had been exceedingly wroth\r\nand had felt impelled to cut short his stay and return as quickly as\r\npossible to the city, so as to give the lie to the rumor.\r\n\r\nThe early summer of nineteen hundred found the sanatorium fairly well\r\nfilled with guests, not the least notable among whom was Mr. Thomas\r\nKearns, the widely-famed head of New York’s Secret Service Bureau, who\r\nhad selected this quiet retreat at which to build up his magnificent\r\nmuscular development and repair the ravages upon his general system\r\nincurred by his exciting and somewhat irregular mode of life in\r\nthe city. To describe Mr. Kearns as widely famed was certainly not\r\noverstating the case, for he was conceded to be the ablest detector of\r\ncrime in the country. So many were the great mysteries which he had\r\nunraveled and with so many important cases had he been connected that\r\nhis fame had stretched far and wide, extending beyond the confines\r\nof the United States and reaching into foreign lands. In a word, his\r\nreputation was international and his achievements had been lauded in\r\nmany countries and in many tongues.\r\n\r\nHis fellow-townsmen of the great metropolis--in fact, his countrymen\r\nat large--were proud of Thomas Kearns. When Americans traveling abroad\r\nheard of some mystery which the secret police of European capitals were\r\nunable to solve, they were wont to smile in a superior way and exclaim:\r\n“They ought to send for Kearns over here--our Kearns. He would show\r\nthem what’s what!”\r\n\r\nEverybody from the doorman at Police Headquarters to the Police\r\nCommissioners and the heads of the city government treated Mr. Kearns\r\nwith distinguished consideration; he was regarded as one of the\r\nInstitutions of the city. No one ever dreamed of interfering with Mr.\r\nKearns. And well he justified this trust. Under his administration the\r\ncriminal classes were kept in a subjection and awe which rendered life\r\nand property more secure in New York than in any other great city\r\nof the world. No criminal from other cities dared seek abode in the\r\nmetropolis without first reporting to Mr. Kearns as to his advent, his\r\nplace of domicile, the causes of his visit, and the duration of his\r\nstay, and no man of criminal record might, under any circumstances,\r\nby day or by night, venture to put foot south of Fulton Street, into\r\nthe great financial centres where the heaped-up wealth of the city was\r\nstored.\r\n\r\nPossessed of ample means, no breath of suspicion had ever touched Mr.\r\nKearns. The vicissitudes of his calling had enabled him upon many\r\noccasions to be of inestimable service to various financial powers, and\r\nthese powers had gladly placed at his disposal information which had\r\nenabled him to build up a handsome private fortune. He was a man of\r\nsome forty years, of medium height and well-rounded figure, with blue\r\neyes, a ruddy complexion and the general appearance of a prosperous\r\nmerchant; but the blue eyes had a very keen look at times and the lips\r\na peculiar way of pursing themselves under the heavy, well-kept brown\r\nmoustache.\r\n\r\nIt is true that here and there at times it was whispered about that Mr.\r\nKearns’ success was largely due to the vast army of informers--“stool\r\npigeons,” as they were technically termed--fostered and maintained by\r\nhim among the criminals themselves, and that in many of his most famous\r\ncases the mystery had been solved by confessions procured through the\r\nexercise of the mysterious rites of the “third degree.” The precise\r\nnature of these rites was known to none save the initiated, but it was\r\ndarkly hinted that, in certain subterranean cells beneath Mr. Kearns’\r\nofficial quarters, tortures were practised beside which the horrors of\r\nthe Spanish Inquisition paled into insignificance.\r\n\r\nAs to the truth of these rumors there seemed to be no precise means\r\nof ascertaining, but certain it was that Mr. Kearns’ methods were\r\neminently successful and--nothing pays like success!\r\n\r\nWith that easy geniality which was one of his characteristics, within\r\ntwenty-four hours after his arrival Mr. Kearns was on terms of\r\nfriendly acquaintance with the various other guests. Most of these\r\nwere men about town, of various ages, but all suffering from much the\r\nsame physical troubles, and all possessed of much the same manners,\r\nhabits and train of thoughts. Of men of this stamp, Mr. Kearns saw\r\nenough in the city and they did not particularly interest him. Among\r\nthese guests, the one who most attracted his interest and attention\r\nwas Professor Walter Stuart Dean, of Chicago. Professor Dean until\r\nrecently had filled the chair of Science at Chicago University, but\r\nhad been forced out because of a book on political economy he had\r\npublished. Some of the theories set forth in this work were of so\r\nadvanced and radical a character as to give offense to certain patrons\r\nof the Institution. Professor Dean’s views were held to be nothing\r\nshort of an assault upon the sacred Rights of Property. As one obese\r\nand influential patron of the seat of learning put it, “Capital stood\r\naghast” at Professor Dean’s views. As someone must suffer whenever\r\npoor, timid Capital is thrown into a fright, Professor Dean, in spite\r\nof his conceded great abilities, was made to pay the penalty.\r\n\r\nThe Professor, however, accepted the situation with much equanimity.\r\nHe had succeeded in selling to one of the great cable companies an\r\ninvention in connection with the transmission of messages and had\r\nreceived quite a goodly sum. This placed him in a position of pecuniary\r\nease so far as the immediate future was concerned, and he had come to\r\nDr. Belden’s establishment to recruit his energies in preparation for\r\nthe launching of a scientific scheme, very comprehensive and ambitious\r\nin its scope, dealing with the question of aërial navigation.\r\n\r\nThe Professor was a man of some forty-seven years, tall and thin and\r\nwith that slight stoop of the shoulders peculiar to the student. The\r\nface was clean-shaven and pale, with a marked puff of the flesh above\r\neach eye where the brows were wont to contract in the intensity of\r\nthought. When the firm, well-cut features lighted in a smile, the\r\nface became positively handsome. One of the Professor’s hobbies,\r\nwhich he was fond of discussing with Mr. Kearns, was the question of\r\nthe economic condition of the masses of the people. The Professor\r\ncontended--and it pained his kindly nature that such was the case--that\r\nthe great mass of the people were not as well-off as they should be;\r\nthat the true happiness and well-being of the great body of mankind had\r\nnot advanced in proportion to the world’s progress in other directions.\r\n\r\nAnother pet subject of discussion with the Professor was his theories\r\nof aërial navigation. In fact, he declared that he had fully and\r\nsatisfactorily solved the problem and was prepared in the near future\r\nto produce a craft with which the air could be navigated at will, both\r\nin safety and at high speed. His plans for this work, he explained,\r\nwere fully perfected and the completed invention would have been an\r\naccomplished fact some time before had he not been hampered by lack\r\nof means. But with the funds received from the sale of his electrical\r\ndevice to the cable company he was in possession of sufficient means\r\nto put through the work properly, and he intended to devote himself\r\nactively to this matter as soon as his present vacation was over. In\r\nthe meantime, he had written on the subject of aërial navigation sundry\r\npamphlets which had attracted attention in scientific circles.\r\n\r\nAt first, Mr. Kearns was disposed to regard Professor Dean’s projects\r\nin this connection as partaking of the visionary, but as he grew to\r\nknow him better, the Professor’s clear-headedness and conservatism made\r\nmore and more of an impression upon him and he came to regard aërial\r\nnavigation, with Professor Dean as its introducer, as not such an\r\nunlikely possibility in the near future.\r\n\r\nAnother acquaintance made by Mr. Kearns was that of Dr. Raoul Jaquet.\r\nDr. Jaquet was not a guest of Dr. Belden’s famous establishment, but\r\nlived in a cottage of his own some little distance away. He was on\r\nfriendly terms with Dr. Belden, who spoke of him as a man of remarkable\r\nattainments in certain branches of scientific research, notably in\r\nchemistry and toxicology. Dr. Jaquet cultivated friendly relations\r\nwith Professor Dean and Mr. Kearns, and his visits to Dr. Belden’s\r\nestablishment became more frequent than ever. All three were fond\r\nof exercise on foot and they took long rambles together over the\r\nsurrounding country.\r\n\r\nDr. Jaquet, too, had, like Professor Dean, his hobby, and this hobby\r\nwas the subject of suspended animation. He was a Frenchman some fifty\r\nyears of age, short and spare of figure, with a complexion dark as if\r\nstained with walnut juice, and very black and very curly hair, lightly\r\nstreaked with gray. He spoke with great volubility, in quick, jerky\r\nlittle sentences whose peculiar idiomatic twists suggested a direct\r\ntranslation from his native French. Upon one occasion, they visited his\r\ncottage and he showed them different animals, apparently sound asleep,\r\nwhich he declared were in various stages of suspended animation. He\r\npointed out a peacefully sleeping dog, and explained that it had been\r\nin this condition for sixty-five days without a particle of food or\r\ndrop of liquid. He also exhibited a rabbit which had been in the same\r\nstate for four months. All he had to do, the Doctor declared, was\r\nto restore them to wakefulness and they would promptly resume their\r\nnormal condition. Mr. Kearns failed to restrain a mild expression of\r\nhis skepticism; but the Doctor’s voluble protestations forced him to\r\naccept the statement of their condition, though he still maintained the\r\nanimals could either not be aroused at all, or else would drop dead as\r\nsoon as awakened. The Doctor promptly awakened the rabbit. The animal\r\nseemed at first slightly lethargic and dazed, but it quickly vindicated\r\nthe Doctor’s claims by cavorting about its cage and then falling to\r\nwork, in a businesslike way, upon a proffered lettuce leaf.\r\n\r\nDoctor Jaquet was enthusiastic on the subject of hibernation, pointing\r\nwith pride to the achievements in this direction of snakes and many\r\nanimals, which were known to live to great ages. He declared his\r\nconviction that in suspended animation could be found an excellent cure\r\nfor many diseases, notably troubles of the digestive tract; that during\r\nthe period of suspension Nature, freed from the necessity of performing\r\nher ordinary routine functions, would be given an opportunity of making\r\nher own cure. In a word, suspended animation was, according to Dr.\r\nJaquet, the great and true panacea for most of the evils with which\r\nmortality was afflicted.\r\n\r\n“You mean,” questioned Mr. Kearns, after Dr. Jaquet had launched\r\nout into his favorite discussion as a sequel to the resurrection of\r\nthe rabbit, “if a man has trouble with his liver, or a pain in his\r\nstomach, instead of giving him a pill, or other dose, you would\r\nsuspend him?”\r\n\r\n“That which you say there has reason!” replied the Doctor in his\r\npeculiar phraseology.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Kearns’ manner indicated his skepticism and the Doctor seemed\r\nquite piqued.\r\n\r\n“And how do you bring about this condition of suspended animation?”\r\nasked Mr. Kearns.\r\n\r\n“I put them to sleep. I can make sleep any person--all the world!”\r\ndeclared the little Doctor with conviction.\r\n\r\nMr. Kearns smiled.\r\n\r\n“Ah! You doubt it?” asked the Doctor.\r\n\r\n“Could you put me to sleep, for instance?” inquired Mr. Kearns,\r\nparrying the question.\r\n\r\n“With facility!” replied Dr. Jaquet.\r\n\r\nA look of polite incredulity crept into Mr. Kearns’ face.\r\n\r\n“Will you that I shall try?” asked the Doctor eagerly.\r\n\r\nMr. Kearns remained silent, somewhat taken aback by the novelty of the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n“Ah, you hesitate! You have fear that I shall succeed. But have no\r\nfear. There is nothing which can do you hurt. On the contrary, only\r\ngood!”\r\n\r\n“Fear!” exclaimed Mr. Kearns with a start. “Do not, I beg you, form the\r\nidea that I am afraid to subject myself to your test. I must return to\r\nDr. Belden’s early, so I cannot avail myself of your offer to-day, but\r\nextend it again some time and, upon my word, I shall be much inclined\r\nto take you up.”\r\n\r\n“I can make you sleep for six hours, six days, six weeks!” declared the\r\nDoctor with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n“Let us call it six hours and I should consider that you have fully\r\nvindicated your assertion,” replied Mr. Kearns with a smile.\r\n\r\n“Very well. I will prove to you some day,” declared Dr. Jaquet. “Now,\r\nlisten! To-morrow I will call for you at one o’clock. We will take a\r\ngreat walk together. I will conduct you to a little piece of land which\r\nI own over there in the mountains. On this land is a cave, where I will\r\nshow you some wonderful things.”\r\n\r\n“Very well; that sounds interesting,” replied Mr. Kearns. “You will\r\ncall for us to-morrow, then?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my friends; au revoir until to-morrow,” said the Doctor genially,\r\nas he courteously bowed them to the door.\r\n\r\n“What do you think of that?” asked Mr. Kearns of Professor Dean, as\r\nthey walked down the road on their way back to Dr. Belden’s.\r\n\r\n“Of what?” asked the Professor.\r\n\r\n“Of the assertions made by our interesting little French friend,”\r\nreplied Mr. Kearns.\r\n\r\n“In what connection?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, as to this suspended animation business and his ability to put\r\npeople to sleep and so on.”\r\n\r\n“My work has been entirely confined to the practical branches of\r\nscience,” answered the Professor cautiously. “I have really never had\r\nany opportunity of investigating any matters of this nature. Many\r\npeculiar claims and theories have been advanced as to mesmerism,\r\nhypnotism, and auto-suggestion, but I am not really competent to advise\r\nyou as to their merits.”\r\n\r\n“Answered with the caution of an expert on the witness stand!” cried\r\nMr. Kearns with a laugh. “But tell me this! Do you believe that out of\r\nten men picked haphazard, he could succeed in getting say two out of\r\nthe ten into a condition of suspended animation, or hypnotic sleep, or\r\nwhatever you like to call it? What puzzles me is his apparent ability\r\nto do it with those animals. If it were not for that fact, I should not\r\nbe inclined to give the matter much attention.”\r\n\r\n“I really could not express an opinion,” declared the Professor.\r\n\r\n“Then, answer me this, O Mountain of Caution!” cried Mr. Kearns. “Would\r\nyou be willing to join with me in putting the Doctor to the test?”\r\n\r\nThe Professor remained thoughtfully silent for a moment.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” exclaimed Mr. Kearns maliciously, “shall I throw the taunt in\r\nyour teeth, which the little Doctor threw into mine: that you are\r\nafraid?”\r\n\r\n“I will answer you this way,” replied the Professor calmly. “To-morrow\r\nyou and I are going out together in company of the Doctor. Should you\r\ndecide at any time to-morrow while we are together to enter upon an\r\nadventure of this character, you will not find me loth to join you.\r\nWhen people start out together in any enterprise, it is a maxim with me\r\nthat they should stand shoulder to shoulder.”\r\n\r\n“Spoken like a brick!” declared Mr. Kearns with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n“No,” answered the Professor dryly; “it is a conceded fact that bricks\r\ndo not talk. You are really becoming more wonderful than the Doctor in\r\nyour assertions!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n“SLEEP ON, MY FRIENDS, SLEEP ON”\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time appointed on the following day--it was the tenth of June,\r\n1900--Dr. Jaquet called for them and they started on one of their\r\ncustomary walks. The Doctor acted as guide. His course lay inland, in\r\na northwesterly direction, and the trio marched jauntily on, chatting\r\ngaily together, until some four miles had been covered. Then the Doctor\r\nchanged his course and they struck across country through land which\r\nwas somewhat rocky and broken and thickly covered with scrub bushes and\r\ntrees of a stunted growth.\r\n\r\n“Halloa!” exclaimed Mr. Kearns, “this is pretty rough walking.\r\nRemember, too, we have the return journey. What is the use of wearing\r\nourselves out going over ground like this?”\r\n\r\n“Follow me,” urged Dr. Jaquet, who was leading and picking the way with\r\ncare.\r\n\r\n“Well, tell us at least where you are leading us,” said Mr. Kearns.\r\n“It’s wild enough here never to have been trodden upon by the foot of\r\nman.”\r\n\r\nThus questioned, the Doctor explained that he was leading the way to a\r\nlittle tract of land which he owned in the midst of this wilderness of\r\nscrub growth, apparently abandoned entirely to the squirrels and the\r\njack-rabbits. He told how he had one day explored this land and had,\r\nby the sheerest accident, discovered a natural cave possessing some\r\nwonderful peculiarities. He decided to buy the land upon which it was\r\nlocated, and had acquired it for a mere song as it was practically\r\nvalueless for any purpose whatsoever. He had kept the cave a secret for\r\nfear of its being visited by intruders. They, too, must promise him to\r\nkeep the matter secret. Patience! The ground was rough, but they would\r\nsoon be there.\r\n\r\n“Rough!” exclaimed the Professor; “it’s as rough as civilization.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, come,” responded Kearns, “you’re always criticising civilization.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think it’s a success?” demanded the Professor.\r\n\r\n“Do you dispute it?” challenged Kearns.\r\n\r\n“Can it, after all, be said,” answered Professor Dean, thoughtfully,\r\n“that mankind at large has really gained any practical good by that\r\nprogressive evolution known as civilization? Suppose you were the chief\r\nof a great tribe existing under primitive conditions, and suppose that\r\nyou, possessed of all the knowledge of modern life which you have\r\nto-day, were confronted with the proposition as to whether you would\r\nleave the tribe as it was, or would introduce all the conditions of our\r\npresent advanced civilization, what would be your decision?”\r\n\r\n“Without having given the matter much thought,” replied Mr. Kearns, “my\r\noffhand answer would be, I suppose, that I should divest my primitives\r\nof breech-clouts and put them into top-hats and trousers, and supply\r\nthem with churches, theatres, hospitals, hotels, a stock-exchange,\r\na police headquarters, and all the other and usual adjuncts of\r\ncivilization.”\r\n\r\n“And if I were the chief of such tribe, and you brought such\r\nproposition to me, I should hesitate long before accepting it,”\r\nrejoined the Professor. “I should ponder carefully whether it was not\r\nmy bounden duty to the tribe to decapitate you, lest you should escape\r\nand give the world knowledge of the existence of me and my tribe and\r\nthus bring to us by force the civilization which you proffered. What\r\nwould your civilization mean to the tribe? It would give us great\r\ncities and the million and one artificial adjuncts which form part\r\nand parcel of modern life. Would the men of the tribe be as happy, as\r\nhealthy, or as really comfortable in the teeming tenements, or box-like\r\nflat houses of the cities which had sprung up, as they were under\r\ntheir tents upon the plains? For those tenements and flat houses they\r\nwould have to pay rent, and to earn that rent they would be compelled\r\nin many instances to convert themselves and their families into\r\nindustrial slaves. Who ever heard of so-called savages being evicted\r\nfor non-payment of rent, or dying by the hundreds for want of food as\r\na consequence of economic conditions? And yet, let a great city spring\r\nup and you have thousands of such cases every year! You have spoken\r\nof the churches which your civilization would erect, but for every\r\nchurch which your great city of modern civilization would bring into\r\nexistence, it would also create ten, nay one hundred, drinking-shops\r\nand gambling-houses and brothels. And as to morality, is a primitive\r\ncommunity without churches ever as immoral as a civilized community\r\nwith a church to every other block? You have spoken, too, of hospitals.\r\nIt is true, your civilization would bring fine hospitals, with an army\r\nof doctors and vast stores of drugs, but with these your civilization,\r\nwith its artificial forms of life, would bring into existence a\r\nthousand and one diseases utterly unknown to men living in a primitive\r\nstate. Your cures might be very comprehensive and marvelous, but surely\r\nit would be infinitely better to escape the diseases themselves, in\r\nthe first place. With pardonable professional pride, you have also\r\nalluded to the existence of a police headquarters, but under primitive\r\nconditions such a place would be needless, for the causes which bring\r\nabout the majority of crimes in a civilized community would not exist.\r\nIn a word, the primitive tribesmen to whom I have referred would be\r\nsafe as to their liberty, their homes, their health and their morality,\r\nwhereas under civilization, and in return for the artificial and really\r\nsuperfluous adjuncts it has to offer, these primitive people must\r\nbecome industrial slaves and rent-sweaters and must surround themselves\r\nwith all the evils arising from corruption, crime, immorality and\r\ndisease. Who, I ask you, is the happier? The tribesman procuring his\r\nmeans of livelihood at will by fishing in rivers or in streams, or\r\nscouring the woods and the plains in search of game, or the free-man\r\nin name, but industrial slave in verity, who under the beneficent sway\r\nof our modern civilization ekes out a miserable subsistence in some\r\nsweatshop of the city at a dollar and a half a day.”\r\n\r\n“I must admit your tribesman would seem to have the best of it,”\r\ndeclared Mr. Kearns.\r\n\r\n“And look, too, at the social relations,” continued the Professor.\r\n“In primitive life, the savage maiden mates according to her fancy,\r\naccording to the promptings of her heart. In modern civilization, if\r\nwe are to judge from what we so often read and hear, a great number\r\nof marriages turn upon the question of position, or of money, rather\r\nthan of true affection. Winsome May, stung by her necessities or her\r\nambition, offers herself up to chill December, or, her dainty flesh\r\nquivering with repulsion, surrenders herself into the arms of hoary\r\nMidas, and the children of such union are the offspring of Gluttony\r\nmated with Disgust. You see, these are questions which affect the very\r\nlife blood of the nation! In this and a hundred other ways, the tide\r\nof social life is interfered with and changed by the ever present\r\ninfluence of that one controlling factor in civilized life--money,\r\nmoney, money! Upon my word, it would seem as if the primitive tribesman\r\nhad much better, in the interests of his true happiness and well-being,\r\nremain as he is!”\r\n\r\n“What you say as far as crime is concerned,” replied Mr. Kearns, “is\r\nundoubtedly true enough. If you except those offenses perpetrated under\r\nthe influence of sudden passion, the great majority of crimes arise\r\nfrom the necessities and temptations which form part of modern social\r\nlife. A good deal has been from time to time written about persons\r\nwith criminal tendencies. There are undoubtedly such cases, but my\r\nexperience is that a career of crime involves more hazard, harder work\r\nand less pay than almost any other form of occupation a man could go\r\nin for. The average criminal would be perfectly willing to undertake\r\nany amount of honest work to accomplish his ends, if it were within his\r\npower to accomplish them by such means, and he only perpetrates his\r\ncrime because he sees no other way out of the situation. In saying this\r\nI am not justifying his methods, or warranting the soundness of general\r\ndeductions, but am merely stating a fact. Crime is, as a rule, the\r\nresult of environment, and this environment grows out of the conditions\r\nof modern social life.”\r\n\r\n“Then you admit the correctness of the facts upon which my theory is\r\nbased!” exclaimed the Professor.\r\n\r\n“To a certain extent, yes,” replied Mr. Kearns; “but what would you?\r\nWould you advocate the renouncement of civilization forthwith and a\r\nreturn to the primitive status?”\r\n\r\n“In the existing state of affairs,” answered the Professor gravely,\r\n“we are confronting a condition, not a theory. Of course, it would be\r\nutterly impracticable to advocate such a course; but I do say that we\r\nought to be more modest in our vaunts as to these benefits conferred\r\nby our boasted modern civilization and that we ought to strive to make\r\nthat civilization give a larger share of well-being and happiness to\r\nthe great masses of men. As it is, civilization means the accruing of\r\nimmense advantages to the few with corresponding very doubtful benefits\r\nto the many. This is all wrong and will not be permitted to continue\r\nforever.”\r\n\r\nThus chatting on, they forced their way over ground which grew rougher\r\nand rougher and through brushwood and undergrowth which seemed to\r\nbecome more and more dense. Twice Mr. Kearns had severely stubbed his\r\ntoe against rocks and the Professor’s nose had been lacerated by some\r\nparticularly vicious brambles. Both were becoming somewhat tired and\r\nwere wondering what manner of chase they were being led, when the\r\nDoctor suddenly exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“_Voila!_ Here we are!”\r\n\r\nHis body bent almost to earth, Dr. Jaquet squeezed his way between\r\ntwo matted masses of undergrowth and, his companions following, they\r\nfound themselves in a clearing, entirely surrounded by heavy bushes and\r\ncovered by a rocky formation of very peculiar outline. From one side of\r\nthe rock the Doctor removed a quantity of heaped-up brush and disclosed\r\nquite a large opening.\r\n\r\n“My cave!” declared Dr. Jaquet proudly. “Await me while I make light!”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the Doctor struck a match and descended into the cave. A\r\nmoment later he reappeared.\r\n\r\n“I have lighted the lamp,” he said. “You may enter.”\r\n\r\nHis companions now perceived some roughly made steps which led down\r\nfrom the opening. These they carefully descended and found themselves\r\nin a goodly-sized cave of irregular formation--a cave which was partly\r\nthe work of nature, but which had evidently been enlarged and partly\r\ntransformed by human hands. On the floor were a number of heavy rugs\r\nand ranged along the walls were various furnishings. In the centre,\r\nsuspended from the roof, was a handsome Venetian lamp, which now served\r\nto illuminate the surroundings.\r\n\r\n“Welcome!” exclaimed the Doctor in a loud whisper.\r\n\r\nWelcome!\r\n\r\nWelcome!\r\n\r\nWelcome!\r\n\r\nInstantly following the Doctor’s whisper, his utterance was repeated\r\nthree distinct times in different parts of the cave. The effect was\r\nstartling and weird.\r\n\r\n“This I call ‘The Cave of Whispers,’” said Dr. Jaquet, in response to\r\nhis companions’ inquiring looks. “See! You whisper and your words they\r\ncome back to you!”\r\n\r\nThe Doctor then went on to explain that one of his objects in buying\r\nthe land and fitting up the cave was to make a study of acoustics: a\r\nscience comparatively undeveloped to this day. But the place had a\r\npeculiar charm for him apart from this, he declared.\r\n\r\nThe Professor and Mr. Kearns amused themselves for some time whispering\r\nvarious sentences, all of which were faithfully echoed back to them.\r\n\r\n“And now,” said Dr. Jaquet, “you must be tired my friends. You shall\r\nyourselves rest and I shall give you tobacco to smoke which you will\r\nfind fit for a Sultan.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he arranged for them some rugs and cushions and produced a\r\nhandsome Turkish Narghille, which he placed before them on the floor.\r\nThis he proceeded to prime with a long-fibred, very pale-colored\r\ntobacco, and to each of them he handed an amber stem.\r\n\r\n“Smoke, my friends, and enjoy you yourselves,” he said, as he applied a\r\nlight to the tobacco. “Ah, it is, perhaps, a little chilly here. I will\r\ncover you and you shall have the music, too.”\r\n\r\nHe stretched a rug over each of them, and then, from the side of the\r\ncave, brought forth a little music box, which he placed beside him and\r\nset in operation.\r\n\r\nDr. Jaquet took up a position facing them and lighted a Turkish\r\ncigarette.\r\n\r\n“You are quite comfortable, my friends?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Quite!” answered the Professor.\r\n\r\n“Delightful!” came the reply from Mr. Kearns.\r\n\r\nAnd the cave echoed back their words.\r\n\r\nThe tobacco was peculiarly soothing and delicious. It really was,\r\nas the Doctor had declared, worthy of a Sultan. Both the Doctor’s\r\ncompanions were somewhat tired after their walk. A peculiar sense of\r\nrestfulness and comfort was upon them as they lay at ease, smoking\r\nthe very excellent tobacco and listening to the sweet music falling\r\nso gently upon their ears. Thus silently they lay and smoked on.\r\nThe Doctor’s usual volubility was checked and he quietly smoked his\r\ncigarette, his black eyes fixed upon them.\r\n\r\nThe music box reached the end of its melody. Instantly the Doctor\r\nstarted it again.\r\n\r\n“Look!” he said, in a low whisper, bending toward them. “Look at the\r\nlamp! See how it throws out to you all the light, all the fire of the\r\ndiamond.”\r\n\r\nSlowly and mechanically, in obedience to his direction, they turned\r\ntheir eyes toward the gorgeous hanging lamp. It was as the Doctor said.\r\nFrom its glittering, multi-colored glass sides the light seemed to\r\nrefract in a thousand variegated shades. The smoke issued from between\r\nthe smokers’ lips in slow and dreamy puffs; the rose-water bubbled\r\nrhythmically in the pipe; the sweet music played on.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe odor of a strange incense seemed to fill the air. The lamp, grown\r\nto giant dimensions, appeared to send forth shafts of ever-changing\r\nlight. The walls of the cave rolled back, disclosing magnificent\r\ncathedral aisles, boundless in expanse and rich in marble and porphyry\r\nand gilt, through which the majestic tones of an organ swelled. A sense\r\nof religious fervor and of overmastering awe filled their souls.\r\n\r\nThe scene changed. They were amid the gorgeous splendors of an Oriental\r\npalace--a palace which in its vastness was lost to all sense of\r\nproportion and whose massive dome reached high to heaven.\r\n\r\nHark! The strains of barbaric music, the clashing of cymbals. A\r\nmultitude of dancing girls spring, fairy-like, into motion and move and\r\nsway in all the graceful, voluptuous motions of the Oriental dance.\r\nTheir gazelle-like eyes sparkle; the ornaments upon their bosoms\r\nflash--surely this is the inner Paradise of Mohammed!\r\n\r\nAgain the scene changes. The great dome of the Eastern palace parts\r\nin twain and they are slowly and deliciously wafted upward. They have\r\nno sense of the strangeness of their situation--no fear. Upward,\r\never upward, they pass to giddy heights and yet this same sense of\r\nall-pervading contentment and happiness. The air about them is laden\r\nwith the perfumes of Araby, and strains of melody of more than earthly\r\nsweetness greet the enraptured senses. This must be the music of the\r\nspheres--the chant of the heavenly choir! And through this perfumed,\r\nmusic-laden air they are drifting--drifting--drifting----\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe amber mouthpieces had dropped from the smokers’ lips; their heads\r\nhad sunk back upon the cushions; their lids were closed.\r\n\r\nGently, cautiously, the Doctor rose, his black eyes dilated with\r\nexcitement. Over the sleepers he bent, making mysterious passes toward\r\nthem as they lay. For an hour or more he thus worked; then with a sigh\r\nof exhaustion, the perspiration starting from his brow, he stepped back\r\nand contemplated them.\r\n\r\n“Sleep on, my friends,” he exclaimed, with a chuckle of satisfaction;\r\n“sleep on. Thus could I let you sleep for weeks--many weeks--but, I\r\ntake it, the twenty-four hours will be enough to convince you that the\r\nDoctor Jaquet can make all the world to sleep.”\r\n\r\nHe replaced the Turkish pipe and the music box in their respective\r\nplaces and put the other articles in the cave in order. Then he\r\nprocured more rugs and arranging them over the sleepers, tucked them in\r\ncarefully.\r\n\r\n“Au revoir, my friends, until we meet again,” he murmured and, with a\r\nsweeping bow to the sleeping forms, he made his exit.\r\n\r\nOnce outside, he carefully replaced the quantity of brush which\r\neffectually concealed the entrance to the cave. As he did so, there was\r\na heavy, rumbling noise in the distance, and he glanced at the sky.\r\n\r\n“I must get me home at high speed!” he muttered to himself as he noted\r\nthe darkening heavens. “There is a storm which is coming.”\r\n\r\nHe accordingly retraced his steps at his best speed. He had proceeded\r\nbut little more than half the distance, however, when the storm broke\r\nin all its fury: vivid flashes of forked lightning alternating with\r\nterrific clashes of thunder. Still he pressed on, not knowing how long\r\nthe storm might last and bent upon reaching home.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, this Summer storm reached such a pitch of violence\r\nthat he found himself compelled to seek shelter until its full fury had\r\nin some degree been spent. Not a habitation in sight! Some distance\r\ndown the road, however, was a great oak, whose wide-spreading branches\r\nwould afford at least a temporary haven. Hastening his steps, he\r\nreached the tree.\r\n\r\nAt that very instant, the whole heavens were illumined with a\r\ntremendous blaze of light. A great zigzag tongue of forked lightning\r\nshot forth and darted down upon the oak, rending its massive trunk\r\nasunder in one awful stroke.\r\n\r\nAnd at the foot of the shattered tree, as the thunder crashed forth,\r\nlay a blackened and blighted shape, horrible to behold--the body of Dr.\r\nRaoul Jaquet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II\r\n\r\nTHE PALACE OF THE KING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nON THE BROAD HIGHWAY\r\n\r\n\r\nA-a-a-h!\r\n\r\nA prolonged sigh swelled from Dean’s lips.\r\n\r\n“Thunder and Mars!” Kearns raised himself languidly on his elbow.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to them both that they had been sleeping for quite a long\r\ntime--an unusually long time.\r\n\r\nWhere was the Doctor?\r\n\r\nThe sunlight was streaming down upon their faces. They were no longer\r\nin the cave, but were lying in the outer air upon the grass, their rugs\r\nstill wrapped about them. A few steps away were two men, apparently\r\nlaborers, who stood contemplating them with looks of wonderment not\r\nunmingled with alarm.\r\n\r\nSlowly and unsteadily, Kearns rose to his feet. Dean followed his\r\nexample. Both seemed weak and dizzy.\r\n\r\nKearns turned a pair of blinking eyes toward the laborers.\r\n\r\n“How did we get here?” he asked with the husky voice of a man with a\r\nbad cold.\r\n\r\nOne of the laborers pointed toward the cave. About the entrance some\r\nfelled trees and piled underbrush showed where the men had been working.\r\n\r\n“Where--where is the Doctor?” stammered Kearns, his eyes still blinking\r\nin the strong sunlight and his thoughts and words coming with some\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nThe two laborers turned to each other. On the face of each was a\r\nbucolic leer. They eyed each other for an instant and then the taller\r\nof the two slowly raised his forefinger, tapped his forehead, and\r\nwinked knowingly to his companion. He was a tall, loose-jointed fellow,\r\nwith a little black mark on the left side of his nose and there was\r\nsomething impudent and aggressive in him as he stood there grinning\r\nand showing his yellow fangs. His companion was short and stocky,\r\nwith a freckled face, sandy hair, and a manner suggestive of bashful\r\nawkwardness. He turned to the two strangers furtively, as if half\r\nfearful that the other’s actions might give offense.\r\n\r\n“The Doctor,” repeated the taller man slowly and with peculiar\r\nintonation; “the Doctor! I guess the chances be he’s not far off and in\r\na hot chase after both of yees!”\r\n\r\nAnd he chuckled softly to himself, glancing at his companion.\r\n\r\n“Not far off! Have you seen him? Which way did he go?” quickly inquired\r\nDean.\r\n\r\n“Seen him?” repeated the rustic; “no! I ain’t seen him, nor any of his\r\nmen.”\r\n\r\n“Then what made you say he was not far off?” demanded Dean.\r\n\r\nSilence from the two rustics, who continued to exchange glances.\r\n\r\n“Look here, my good men!” exclaimed Kearns impatiently; “wake up\r\nand listen to me. Just show us the way to the road and you shall\r\nbe suitably rewarded. Perhaps, too, you would find us a horse and\r\ncarriage which we could hire to take us home.”\r\n\r\nThe two men stared at the speaker, open-mouthed, amazed. Again they\r\nturned to each other.\r\n\r\n“A horse and kerridge!” they exclaimed in a breath.\r\n\r\nThen they broke into a loud laugh. Now it was the turn of Kearns and\r\nthe Professor to exchange glances of astonishment. That a simple\r\nrequest to be supplied with information as to where a horse and\r\ncarriage could be hired should produce such results was certainly\r\namazing.\r\n\r\nKearns stepped nearer to Dean. “I believe these fellows are crazy,” he\r\nwhispered. “Perhaps they have escaped from the Weldon Asylum.”\r\n\r\n“The smaller man seems a case of senile dementia,” whispered back\r\nthe Professor, cautiously; “but the larger fellow looks to me like a\r\ndangerous lunatic--possibly a homicidal maniac. We may be in danger of\r\nour lives!”\r\n\r\nWhile this colloquy was in progress, the rustics had not taken their\r\neyes off the strangers for an instant. The taller of the two again\r\nspoke up.\r\n\r\n“A horse and kerridge,” he said. “Maybe if ye had a pitchfork apiece ye\r\ncould scoot away through the air, leaving only a streak of brimstone\r\nbehind ye. I’ve heerd tell o’ sech things!”\r\n\r\nKearns’ quick temper flashed up. He advanced upon the speaker.\r\n\r\n“Confound you, you impudent----”\r\n\r\n“Run fer it, Jem; run fer it!” yelled the smaller man apprehensively.\r\n“They’re a-goin’ to spell!” He took to his heels at full speed.\r\n\r\nJem gave one quick glance at Kearns and was off after his companion.\r\n\r\nKearns and the Professor stood watching their rapidly retreating\r\nfigures until they disappeared around the bend of a hill.\r\n\r\n“Well--I’m hanged!” exclaimed Kearns. “Mad,” he added with conviction,\r\n“mad as March hares.”\r\n\r\n“You see what comes of ill-advised asperity!” remarked Dean\r\nreprovingly. “Instead of soothing these two unfortunate madmen, you\r\nhave thrown them into a condition of excitement. Your impetuosity has\r\nreacted upon them. You have sent them flying--running amuck--and God\r\nknows what may happen to any unfortunate who crosses their path!”\r\n\r\n“But did you ever know of such impudence?” cried Kearns, still angry.\r\n“I civilly ask these louts the direction of the main road and where I\r\ncan hire a horse and carriage; they laugh in my face; invite me to ride\r\non a pitchfork! Things have come to a pretty pass if every lunatic one\r\nmeets thinks he has full license to be as impudent as he pleases. And\r\nthey acted as if they thought we were crazy, confound them!”\r\n\r\n“It’s a common delusion of crazy folks to imagine everyone is crazy\r\nexcept themselves,” said the Professor.\r\n\r\n“Yes; that’s very true! I’ve noticed that!” assented Kearns.\r\n\r\n“As I remarked before, a case of senile dementia, that little fellow,”\r\nsaid the Professor sagaciously; “a clear case of senile dementia, my\r\ngood friend!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” declared Kearns, “I noted his sickly smile.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Dean, “they’re gone and we are fortunately left alive\r\nto tell the story and to put the madhouse people on their trail. The\r\nnext thing to be done is to find the main road and get to the nearest\r\nvillage. There we can hire a conveyance and get refreshments. I am\r\nboth hungry and thirsty.”\r\n\r\n“The nearest village,” repeated Kearns musingly; “I take it that would\r\nbe Averill, or would Patchley be nearer?”\r\n\r\n“I should say Averill, decidedly.”\r\n\r\n“Well; let’s be off, then, and find the main road,” suggested Kearns.\r\n“This must be the way, I’m pretty sure.” Picking up the blankets\r\nand rugs in which they had been wrapped, he tossed them through the\r\nentrance to the cave and started off.\r\n\r\n“Is it safe, do you think, for us to leave those things there?” asked\r\nthe Professor.\r\n\r\n“What else can we do with them?” answered Kearns. “Let the Doctor\r\nattend to that. We’ll notify him, of course, as soon as we get back. He\r\nhad no business to leave us in that fashion, anyway!”\r\n\r\n“I quite agree with you as to that,” assented the Professor. “Tired out\r\nwith our walk, we must have fallen asleep as we smoked and he calmly\r\nleft us.”\r\n\r\n“By George!” exclaimed Kearns, with a sudden start; “I wonder if the\r\nDoctor has been up to any of his pranks.”\r\n\r\n“Pranks!” repeated the Professor in astonishment.\r\n\r\n“Yes; putting people to sleep. I wonder if this sleep of ours was of\r\nhis contriving.”\r\n\r\nThe Professor contracted his brows thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“Now that you mention it,” he declared, “I should not be astonished if\r\nit was.”\r\n\r\n“Did you notice that pale-colored, peculiar, but certainly very\r\nexcellent tobacco?” continued Kearns eagerly. “Upon my word, I begin to\r\nsuspect it was fixed--doped--drugged!”\r\n\r\n“You don’t mean to say so!” exclaimed the Professor.\r\n\r\n“Well, I just did say so,” retorted Kearns.\r\n\r\n“If such is indeed the case, how long do you think we have slept?”\r\nquestioned the Professor.\r\n\r\nKearns drew out his watch, looked at it and then put it to his ear.\r\n\r\n“What does your watch say?” he asked.\r\n\r\nThe Professor consulted his watch.\r\n\r\n“It has stopped,” he declared. “Why, it seems to be run down.”\r\n\r\nKearns glanced at the sky.\r\n\r\n“Professor,” he remarked solemnly, “it looks to me as if we had slept\r\nclean into the next day.”\r\n\r\n“How so?” asked the Professor, vacantly.\r\n\r\n“Both our watches are run down,” replied Kearns. “That’s one point.\r\nWhen we entered the cave it was half past three o’clock in the\r\nafternoon. From the sun I’d say it’s now about one o’clock. As time\r\nhasn’t the habit of going backward, I’d reach the conclusion that this\r\nmust be the afternoon of the following day.”\r\n\r\n“Really, this is most astonishing!” exclaimed the Professor, apparently\r\nquite shocked at the idea that he should have thus slumbered for nearly\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThey worked their way around the base of a hill, over ground rough\r\nand stony and partially covered with trees and undergrowth. Before\r\nlong they emerged upon comparatively open ground and then a puzzling\r\nfeature presented itself to their attention. When led to the cave by\r\nthe Doctor, he had taken them miles through scrub growth and over\r\nrough land. Now, after traveling a comparatively short distance they\r\nhad emerged into the open and before them stretched fields under\r\ncultivation, while some three-quarters of a mile away lay a broad,\r\nwhite road. This was decidedly a much shorter cut than the path the\r\nDoctor had taken. But how was it that he had not known of it? It was\r\nreally puzzling!\r\n\r\n“There’s the road!” exclaimed Dean, pointing to the broad, white line\r\nin the distance.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” assented Kearns, musingly, “but is that the road we are looking\r\nfor? This doesn’t seem to be the way we came. The lay of the land is\r\ndifferent.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps we have come out of the brush in a different direction,”\r\nsuggested Dean.\r\n\r\n“We certainly must have,” replied Kearns. “Well, right or wrong,\r\nthere’s nothing to do but to make for that road before us.”\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of this view was apparent, and they accordingly made\r\ntheir way around the fields under cultivation and finally--hot and\r\ntired--gained the road. Up and down it they looked and perceived in\r\nthe distance, some two miles away to the left, the outlines of what\r\nappeared to be a goodly-sized town.\r\n\r\n“I wonder what the name of that place may be,” remarked Kearns.\r\n\r\n“Whatever it is, it’s a good way off,” replied Dean, mopping the\r\nperspiration from his brow. “But have you noticed what a magnificent\r\nroad this is? It reminds me of one of those splendid _chemins_ of\r\nSouthern France, only this is even finer.”\r\n\r\nBoth stood admiringly contemplating the road. It was very wide, very\r\nwhite and splendidly smooth. On one side was a broad, raised pathway,\r\nevidently for the use of foot-passengers. A curious feature of the\r\nroadway itself was its division by a raised earthwork barrier, cutting\r\nit into two even parallel halves. At regular intervals were steps by\r\nwhich ascent might be made from the road to the footway and also little\r\nbridges connecting the dividing barrier with the pathway.\r\n\r\n“Quite a model road,” commented Kearns. “I suppose it’s some kind of a\r\nspeedway. It’s queer, though, that I never heard there was such a road\r\nin this section. Fact is, I don’t remember ever seeing a road of this\r\nkind anywhere.”\r\n\r\n“Nor I,” declared Dean.\r\n\r\nThey were standing on the extreme edge of the road, just where they\r\nhad stepped out from the field. A short distance away was a bend,\r\nconcealing the run of the road for some little distance beyond.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there were two sharp toots, as of a horn, a rattle and a rush\r\nof wheels, and past them dashed a peculiar, arrow-shaped, horseless\r\nvehicle, traveling at tremendous speed. So rapid was its flight that\r\nthey had time to catch only a fleeting glimpse of a man, whose right\r\nhand gripped a long, shining lever. So sudden was the appearance of\r\nthe vehicle and so great its speed that the two wayfarers were both\r\nstartled and astonished.\r\n\r\n“Was that an automobile?” exclaimed Dean.\r\n\r\n“It looked like one,” answered Kearns, “but I never before saw one of\r\nthat peculiar construction. And the speed! Whew!”\r\n\r\n“Yes; reckless to the last degree,” remarked Dean. “I think it would\r\nbe highly desirable for us to gain the footpath before we meet another\r\ntraveler.”\r\n\r\n“Stated with the accuracy of science,” declared Kearns. “By all means,\r\nlet’s take the footpath.”\r\n\r\nThey accordingly traversed the first roadway, clambered over the\r\ndividing barrier, crossed the second roadway and ascended to the\r\nfootpath. Then they turned their faces in the direction of the town\r\nvisible in the distance. They had proceeded but a few steps when Kearns\r\nsuddenly stopped and turned to the Professor with the air of a man to\r\nwhom a happy thought has come.\r\n\r\n“Professor,” he said with a smile, “it’s just occurred to me that right\r\nhere, in my hind pocket, I’ve a flask. I remember slipping it in before\r\nstarting, thinking it might come in handy during our walk, and it looks\r\nnow as if it might.”\r\n\r\n“A flask!” exclaimed the Professor, diffidently. “May I ask what it\r\ncontains?”\r\n\r\n“Whiskey--just plain whiskey,” replied Kearns, as he pulled out the\r\nflask. “It’s a warm day and we’re both tired, in spite of that long\r\nrest. May I invite you to join me?”\r\n\r\n“The day _is_ warm,” assented the Professor, “and we _are_ tired. I do\r\nnot usually indulge, but upon this occasion----”\r\n\r\n“Help yourself,” exclaimed Kearns, detaching the small silver\r\nreceptacle which served as a drinking cup and handing it and the flask\r\nto Dean.\r\n\r\nThe latter helped himself and handed back the flask to Kearns.\r\n“Really!” he exclaimed with some show of alarm, “that seems to be\r\npowerful stuff. I can feel it all through me.”\r\n\r\n“It’s the finest old Kentucky whiskey,” replied Kearns, somewhat\r\nnettled that the quality of his liquor should be questioned. “It was a\r\nspecial present to me from Colonel Claybourne, the famous distiller.”\r\n\r\n“Powerful--very powerful!” repeated Dean.\r\n\r\nKearns poured himself out a liberal measure.\r\n\r\n“Ah! Splendid stuff!” he exclaimed as he lowered the drinking cup from\r\nhis lips. “That puts new life into one. But, by George, you’re right!\r\nIt is strong. I never before found it so strong as this.”\r\n\r\n“It must be because we are drinking it upon empty stomachs,” suggested\r\nthe Professor.\r\n\r\n“Even so,” declared Kearns, “I can’t understand why it should seem to\r\nhave such strength.”\r\n\r\nThey proceeded on their way and had gone but a short distance when\r\nthey came to a huge sign-board, planted high up upon the barrier\r\ndividing the two roadways. This sign-board bore a number of lines, in\r\ngreat black letters. The two wayfarers stopped and eagerly scanned the\r\ninscription. It read:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  REGULATIONS OF THE HIGHWAY.\r\n\r\n  Phaeromobiles, Lakomoters and other Voiters MUST NOT EXCEED THE SPEED\r\n  ALLOWED BY LAW.\r\n\r\n  At all CURVES, directors of voiters must slow down to HALF SPEED.\r\n\r\n  DESCENTS must be made from the LEFT side only of voiters south-bound\r\n  and from the RIGHT side only of voiters north-bound, and after\r\n  descending, persons must traverse the roadway by the CROSS-BRIDGES\r\n  ONLY.\r\n\r\n  All voiters must hoist the STOP SIGNAL before coming to a HALT.\r\n\r\n  All voiters must bear lights of STANDARD SIZE and STRENGTH after\r\n  SUNSET and must, in addition, carry in RESERVE a RED DANGER LAMP,\r\n  with independent storage, which must be IMMEDIATELY EXPOSED OVER THE\r\n  VOITER in case of ACCIDENT to the regulation lights.\r\n\r\n  The casting of any OBSTRUCTION on the roadway is a FELONY.\r\n\r\n  Any violation of these Regulations will be PROSECUTED to the FULL\r\n  EXTENT OF THE LAW.\r\n\r\n                                                         WARING,\r\n                                       I. & R. Commissioner of Highways.\r\n\r\nThey read the sign over and both stood staring at it, a puzzled\r\nexpression on their faces.\r\n\r\n“Very curious!” commented Dean. “The language used seems to me quite\r\nstrange. Take that word _voiter_, for instance. What does it mean? Did\r\nyou ever see the word before?”\r\n\r\n“Never!” declared Kearns, still staring at the sign-board.\r\n\r\n“It is, I take it,” continued Dean, “a new-fangled word coined by the\r\nmakers of automobiles to designate some new kind of motor conveyance.\r\nPossibly it is taken from the French word _voiture_, which means\r\ncarriage.”\r\n\r\n“What’s puzzling me,” said Kearns, “is the title of this fellow Waring,\r\nwho signs that notice. Read it: ‘I. & R. Commissioner of Highways.’\r\nIt’s high-sounding enough, but what the deuce does the ‘I. & R.’ stand\r\nfor?”\r\n\r\n“‘I. & R.,’” repeated the Professor, staring hard at the sign. “I find\r\nit impossible to imagine what those letters stand for. If we were in\r\nEurope, I should instantly surmise the meaning, but we are in the\r\nUnited States.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; we’re in the United States,” replied Kearns, “and here we see\r\nthose letters only around election time--‘_I_’ for Independent and\r\n‘_R_’ for Republican. But that wouldn’t explain matters here; for\r\nwhat’s the meaning of the ‘_and_’ between the two letters? Well, I\r\ndon’t suppose we’ll find out by standing here in the sun staring at\r\nthat big board. Besides, I don’t care a rap whether this Waring is a\r\nRepublican or a confounded Independent. Let’s have another little nip\r\nfrom the flask to recruit our strength and move on.”\r\n\r\n“I seldom indulge,” began the Professor, “but----”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be bashful, Professor,” hastily interposed Kearns; “help\r\nyourself.”\r\n\r\nAfter each had thus refreshed himself, they renewed their journey.\r\n\r\n“From your scornful reference to Independents just now,” remarked Dean,\r\n“you don’t seem to hold them in very high estimation.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, those Independents!” exclaimed Kearns, with fine scorn. “It’s my\r\nexperience that an Independent is usually a fellow with a keen eye to\r\n_his_ independent interest. His independence consists of balancing his\r\nvote between the two parties, with a view to casting it for the side\r\noffering him the higher inducement. A pest on your Independents, I say!\r\nBut, hello! what’s the matter with your hat?”\r\n\r\nThe sun was streaming fiercely down and the Professor, to shield his\r\nface, gave the brim of his white Fedora a sharp pull over his eyes. But\r\nthe brim parted from the crown and settled comically around his nose.\r\nAn examination of the hat showed the goods to be in a condition which\r\nKearns described as “absolutely rotten”--almost brittle as tinder.\r\n\r\n“A nice hat that!” commented Kearns. “Permit me to ask you the classic\r\nquestion: Where did you get that hat?”\r\n\r\n“At Knox,” ruefully answered the Professor. “But,” he added, critically\r\nsurveying his companion, “it doesn’t seem to me that you have much to\r\nboast about as a Beau Brummell.”\r\n\r\nIt was Kearns’ turn to examine his clothes. Glancing down at the blue\r\nserge suit he wore, he saw that a large section of cloth had apparently\r\nrotted away from the bottom of one of the trouser legs, and the lining\r\nof the coat had broken away from the material in several places. Like\r\nthe Professor’s hat, the whole material seemed tinder-like and brittle.\r\nTo add to his discomfiture, the leather of his left shoe began to\r\npart company with the sole. Ruefully, Kearns noted this involuntary\r\ndisrobement. He had always been somewhat particular in dress.\r\n\r\n“Professor,” he exclaimed humorously, “if we want to keep our\r\nreputation for decency it’s high time we reached home.”\r\n\r\n“Very high time,” assented Dean solemnly.\r\n\r\n“If we could only get a hack, or a conveyance of any kind,” lamented\r\nKearns.\r\n\r\n“I would be willing to ride home in the bottom of an express wagon,”\r\ndeclared the Professor. “Even a coal cart I would not despise.”\r\n\r\n“But there’s not a vehicle in sight!” deplored Kearns.\r\n\r\n“Not even an ash-cart, or a hearse,” declared the Professor.\r\n\r\n“There’s just one more nip left in the flask,” said Kearns, sadly;\r\n“let’s take that and move on.”\r\n\r\n“I rarely indulge,” began the Professor, “but----”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know!” interrupted Kearns hastily; “you’ve mentioned that\r\nbefore. Kindly help yourself.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said the Professor, sternly, “I was going to add that I felt it\r\nmy duty to do so upon this occasion out of regard for you.”\r\n\r\n“Regard for me!” exclaimed Kearns in perplexity.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” continued the Professor. “For some time past I have noticed,\r\nsir, that the tip of your nose is becoming unduly red, and that\r\nyour eyes have the congested appearance which betokens incipient\r\nintoxication. I do not know, sir, whether in due regard for you--who,\r\nfrom the position you hold, are presumed to pose as a conservator of\r\npublic morals--it is not my duty to forthwith dispose of that little\r\nwhich yet remains in this pernicious flask.”\r\n\r\n“Professor,” declared Kearns, mockingly, “out of consideration for\r\nyou, I have hesitated to speak earlier, but it now is incumbent upon\r\nme to say that I have had my eye on you for more than ten minutes\r\npast. You, as an instructor of the community and a trainer of budding\r\nyouth, should stand forth as a firm and shining example of all that is\r\nstraightforward and goodly, and yet it is my duty to inform you that\r\nyour present way is not straightforward nor is your walk upright. In a\r\nword, you are staggering, Professor.”\r\n\r\n“Sir!” exclaimed the Professor with dignity.\r\n\r\n“A fact, sir!” declared Kearns. “I will draw a mark upon this path and\r\nI’ll wager two to one you can’t walk it in a straight line.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t accept your test,” said the Professor cautiously. “I’m\r\nsomewhat fatigued to-day and I admit a certain peculiar weakness in the\r\nknees.”\r\n\r\n“H’m!” exclaimed Kearns.\r\n\r\n“Shall we divide?” asked the Professor softly, holding the flask in his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n“Agreed!” whispered back Kearns.\r\n\r\nOnce more they started, speculating as they went over what strange\r\nnecromancy the Doctor could have exerted to work such curious effects\r\nalike upon their surroundings and their persons. When about a mile from\r\nthe village they saw approaching two women, carrying between them a\r\nbasket.\r\n\r\n“Good-day, Ma’am,” said Kearns with much politeness, as they met; “it’s\r\na warm day.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” answered the elder woman, “it is a warm day, but seasonable\r\nfor this time of year.”\r\n\r\n“Why,” said Kearns, “you don’t usually have it as warm as this out here\r\nso early in the year, do you?”\r\n\r\n“Early in the year!” exclaimed the woman. “Sure it’s not too warm for\r\nthe end of July.”\r\n\r\n_The end of July!_\r\n\r\nKearns and the Professor turned to each other in bewilderment. It\r\nwas the tenth day of June when they had started on the walk with Dr.\r\nJaquet, and here was this woman telling them it was the end of July.\r\nOh, monstrous, incredible! They had slept a full six weeks!\r\n\r\n“Then, too, sir,” continued the woman, who seemed not disinclined to\r\nrest her heavy basket and indulge in a little gossip, “it’s always apt\r\nto be warm on a hot day around fourteen o’clock.”\r\n\r\n“Around fourteen o’clock!” repeated Kearns and the Professor, both\r\nagape.\r\n\r\n“Yes; but I consider fifteen o’clock to be the hottest hour of the day.”\r\n\r\n“Fifteen o’clock!” echoed the men.\r\n\r\n“Tell me,” said Kearns, after a pause, “what’s the name of that\r\nvillage?”\r\n\r\n“Pemberton, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Pemberton--Pemberton,” repeated Kearns. “I thought I knew all the\r\nplaces in this section, yet I never heard of Pemberton. Can you tell me\r\nin which direction lies Averill?”\r\n\r\n“Averill, sir? I never heard the name.”\r\n\r\n“Have you lived here long?”\r\n\r\n“All my life.”\r\n\r\nKearns paused a moment thoughtfully. Then a sudden thought occurred to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“You say this is the end of July?”\r\n\r\n“Yes sir; the twenty-fifth.”\r\n\r\n“Any news lately about the nominations?”\r\n\r\n“Nominations, sir!” repeated the woman; “what nominations?”\r\n\r\n“Why, the Presidential, of course!”\r\n\r\n“The Presidential,” repeated the woman blankly.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Kearns, gently; “the Presidential nominations.”\r\n\r\nThe woman made no reply; she stood staring blankly at the speaker.\r\n\r\nThe younger woman all this time had been eyeing the wayfarers with\r\ncuriosity. Into her brown eyes there now came a look of suspicion and\r\nmistrust.\r\n\r\n“Mother,” she whispered, plucking the elder woman by the sleeve, “we’d\r\nbetter be going.” And she caught up one end of the basket.\r\n\r\nThe situation was certainly embarrassing. Kearns made a hasty endeavor\r\nto turn the subject.\r\n\r\n“The village seems a good way off and we are tired,” he said. “Do you\r\nthink, if we wait here, we might get a horse and carriage to take us to\r\nthe village?”\r\n\r\nThe woman glanced sharply at him and gathered up her end of the basket.\r\nShe and her daughter started on their way. As she passed Kearns, she\r\nturned her head.\r\n\r\n“It’s ill work,” she said, “a-poking fun at those who’ve given you\r\nnaught but civil answers.”\r\n\r\nKearns and Dean stood watching the retreating figures as they passed\r\ndown the road. Suddenly, as by one impulse, they faced each other. The\r\nProfessor laid his hand upon Kearns’ shoulder.\r\n\r\n“The twenty-fifth of July--did you hear that woman say----”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I heard,” answered Kearns, slowly.\r\n\r\n“If her statement be true, we have been dead to the world for a good\r\nsix weeks.”\r\n\r\nBoth men stood silent for a moment. Then the Professor again spoke:\r\n\r\n“These strange surroundings--the queer actions of these people! What\r\ncan it all mean?”\r\n\r\n“Mean!” answered Kearns with a laugh. “It begins to look as if we were\r\neither mad, or bewitched!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE MAN WITH THE COCKED HAT\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a long minute they stood there, facing each other, undecided and\r\nperplexed, bewildered by the strangeness of the situation. Kearns spoke\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n“The end of our trouble lies there,” he exclaimed, pointing to the\r\nvillage. “I’m hungry, thirsty and tired. Come!”\r\n\r\n“I agree with you,” answered the Professor. “Let us push on, by all\r\nmeans.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of heat and fatigue another half-hour found them on the\r\noutskirts of the village. As they approached they were passed several\r\ntimes by vehicles leaving the village and proceeding along the road at\r\na high rate of speed. The occupants of most of these vehicles scanned\r\nthe wayfarers with eager curiosity.\r\n\r\nReaching the village, the first thing to attract their attention was\r\nthe peculiar construction of its streets. The sidewalks on either side\r\nof what appeared to be the principal street were moving sidewalks and\r\nthe roadway, where the vehicles passed up and down, was depressed to\r\na depth some twenty feet below the level of the sidewalks. At all the\r\nstreet crossings were bridges connecting the sidewalks on either side\r\nof the way.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m blessed!” exclaimed Kearns. “I had no idea there was such a\r\ntown as this in these parts, or anywhere else, for that matter!”\r\n\r\n“It certainly seems to be a model place,” declared the Professor.\r\n“Just look, what a splendid system of separating the vehicles from\r\npedestrians.”\r\n\r\n“If such a system could be adopted in the city, it would annually save\r\nmany lives now lost in street accidents,” remarked Kearns.\r\n\r\nThe second house before them was a comfortable inn, with a low, wide\r\nporch, holding a number of tables where sat men drinking.\r\n\r\n“I am really very thirsty,” said the Professor. “Let us refresh\r\nourselves here before going further. Shall we take a table on the\r\nporch?”\r\n\r\n“No,” suggested Kearns, “let’s go inside. We’ll probably get quicker\r\nservice.”\r\n\r\nThey ascended the two steps, crossed the porch and entered what\r\nappeared to be the bar-room. It was spacious, with tables and chairs on\r\neither side of the entrance and with a long bar facing the door. Behind\r\nthe bar stood a white-jacketed bartender.\r\n\r\n“What will you have?” inquired Kearns, as they reached the bar.\r\n\r\n“A long drink of Rhine wine and seltzer,” answered the Professor.\r\n\r\nKearns turned to the bartender.\r\n\r\n“A long drink of Rhine wine and seltzer and a high ball.”\r\n\r\n“A long drink of Rhine wine and seltzer and a----?”\r\n\r\n“High ball.”\r\n\r\n“High ball? Never heard of it,” the bartender said thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“What!” exclaimed Kearns. “Never heard of a high ball? It’s the most\r\npopular drink in the country.”\r\n\r\n“That’s likely, isn’t it?” answered the bartender, with some scorn.\r\n“I’ve worked in a good many places in New York and I never heard of\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Never heard of it!” cried Kearns. “Why, man, the head barkeeper of the\r\nWaldorf-Astoria told me a couple of weeks--that is--ah--a couple of\r\nmonths ago--that they sold over two hundred high balls a day.”\r\n\r\n“The Waldorf-Astoria,” repeated the bartender, shortly; “what’s that?”\r\n\r\nKearns could only gasp in astonishment.\r\n\r\n“The Waldorf-Astoria,” repeated the bartender meditatively; “oh, yes!\r\nI think I remember now. Isn’t that the big restorang and commercial\r\nlodging-house ’way down below Forty-second Street somewhere? Sure, I\r\nremember, now. I couldn’t tell you what they may sell in a place like\r\nthat. I’ve always worked in first-class places. How did you say that\r\ndrink is made?”\r\n\r\n“Simply a little whiskey and a long dash of seltzer,” said Kearns,\r\nwearily.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” answered the bartender airily; “that’s a Marquanna--called after\r\nthe famous Marquis Marquanna.”\r\n\r\n“Call it what you like,” said Kearns testily, “but serve it up; I’m\r\nparched with thirst. Give me Hunter whiskey.”\r\n\r\n“What whiskey?”\r\n\r\n“Hunter.”\r\n\r\n“Never heard of it!”\r\n\r\n“Great Scott!” cried Kearns. “What have you, then?”\r\n\r\n“What brands? Why, we have both.”\r\n\r\n“Both? How do you call them?”\r\n\r\n“Imperial Court and Consolidated Trust.”\r\n\r\n“Never heard of either of them,” retorted Kearns, maliciously.\r\n“However, give me either one; only hurry.”\r\n\r\nThe bartender produced a long-necked bottle of Rhine wine and a\r\npeculiar wicker-covered bottle of seltzer. The whiskey he measured out\r\nand poured into a tall glass. Then he added the seltzer.\r\n\r\nBoth the wayfarers emptied their glasses in one long, greedy draught.\r\n\r\n“That really went down well!” remarked the Professor as he laid aside\r\nhis glass.\r\n\r\n“So well,” replied Kearns, “that I think we might venture once again.\r\nWhat say you, Professor?”\r\n\r\n“I rarely--” began the Professor.\r\n\r\n“Fill them up again,” ordered Kearns of the bartender.\r\n\r\nAt this moment there was a commotion at the other end of the bar-room\r\nwhich attracted general attention. Ranged against the wall were three\r\nstrange looking machines, remotely suggestive of barber chairs. There\r\nwas a man seated in each of two of the machines, which, with a gentle\r\nwhirr of wheels, were in operation. They were automatic shaving\r\nmachines, operated by depositing a coin in the slot.\r\n\r\nThe commotion which had been caused grew out of the fact that one of\r\nthe machines had apparently become disordered, which resulted in the\r\noccupant of its chair receiving a slight gash upon one side of his\r\nchin. The person thus mutilated was furious. He sprang from the chair\r\nand, seizing his walking stick, began furiously belaboring the machine.\r\n\r\n“The Chinese pest seize (whack! whack!) this confounded, infernal\r\nmachine (whack! whack!) it’s gone and cut me nearly clean through to\r\nthe teeth (whack! whack! whack!) I’ll----”\r\n\r\n“Hi! Hold on there!” yelled the man in the adjoining machine. “You’re\r\nshaking this automat of mine, sir, so that it’s trembling all over;\r\njust at the moment, too, when the knife’s over my gullet.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t care!” howled back the man with the stick. “I’ve been cut and\r\nI’ll never stop until I’ve smashed this infernal thing into bits.” And\r\nhe banged away at the machine.\r\n\r\n“Stop, I say!” yelled the other man, with bulging eyes, “I can feel the\r\nknife entering my skin. If I’m cut, I’m liable to get the erysipelas.\r\nBy heaven, sir, if you make this automat cut me, I’ll have your blood!”\r\n\r\nThe bartender, scenting a tragedy, ran from behind the bar and\r\nsucceeded finally in pacifying the man with the stick.\r\n\r\n“It isn’t often those machines get out of order,” said the bartender as\r\nhe returned to his post, “but when they do, it’s apt to make customers\r\nmad.”\r\n\r\n“They are automatic shaving machines, I see,” remarked Kearns.\r\n\r\n“Yes; and a mighty handy and ingenious invention they are,” answered\r\nthe bartender. “You drop a dime in the slot and you get a light or\r\nclose shave, as you may desire, and your photograph thrown in at the\r\nend of the operation. Did you ever try them?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Then you ought to,” urged the bartender.\r\n\r\n“Never!” said Kearns with decision. “I find it bad enough to have my\r\nnose tweaked and my face bedaubed by a human, but never will I trust my\r\nlife to any confounded machine of this character. By the way, you may\r\nserve up those drinks I ordered.”\r\n\r\n“Same?” inquired the bartender.\r\n\r\n“Yes; that was pretty good whiskey,” said Kearns. “What did you say was\r\nthe brand?”\r\n\r\n“Imperial Court.”\r\n\r\n“And the other brand you have?”\r\n\r\n“Consolidated Trust.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” exclaimed Kearns, “I must say I don’t like your names. I am\r\nequally opposed to Imperialism and to Trusts. Between the two evils,\r\nI don’t know which to choose. However, as I have tried the Imperial\r\nbrand, this time I’ll go in for the Trust.”\r\n\r\nThe bartender gave the speaker a quick, sharp glance. Then he winked\r\nwarningly and rolled his eyes in the direction of one of the tables at\r\nwhich two men were seated. These two men were intently watching Kearns\r\nand his companion, and as the former turned, following the direction\r\nof the bartender’s glance, both men hastily looked away and assumed an\r\nair of listless indifference. One of the men was small, with a blond\r\nmustache, blue eyes and a squint. His companion was tall, thin and\r\ndark. In the meantime, the bartender was preparing the drinks ordered.\r\n\r\nHe served these and, their first thirst somewhat appeased, the\r\ntravelers this time put down the glasses only half emptied. Kearns laid\r\na fifty-cent piece on the counter in payment. The bartender picked it\r\nup and eyed it curiously. Then he laid it carefully away, not in the\r\ncash drawer, but among some small glasses on one of the shelves of the\r\nbar.\r\n\r\n“Let us have some cigars,” suggested the Professor.\r\n\r\n“Good idea!” exclaimed Kearns, turning to the bartender; “cigars, if\r\nyou please.”\r\n\r\nHis voice was pitched somewhat higher than usual and his face was\r\nslightly flushed. It was as if the two drinks he had taken had gone a\r\nbit to his head. Curious that a six weeks’ abstinence should make a man\r\nso susceptible!\r\n\r\n“What kind of a town is this, anyway,” said he to the barkeeper, in a\r\ntone of banter, “where you don’t keep any of the popular brands of\r\nwhiskey and where I don’t see a campaign banner, though the election is\r\ncoming!”\r\n\r\n“Election!” repeated the barkeeper blankly.\r\n\r\n“Election is what I said,” repeated Kearns with emphasis. “Which way\r\ndoes this town go--Democratic or Republican?”\r\n\r\nThe bartender stared first at the speaker and then turned an uneasy eye\r\ntoward the two men at the table.\r\n\r\n“We are loyal here--loyal!” he stammered at last.\r\n\r\n“Loyal!” cried Kearns, flushing, “loyal to what? The existing\r\nadministration, I suppose you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; to the--to the--existing administration,” stammered the barkeeper\r\nconfusedly.\r\n\r\nAt this point Dean interposed, with some show of warmth.\r\n\r\n“Then,” he cried, “I feel sorry for your intelligence, for there was\r\nnever a bigger nest of corruptionists and oppressors of the people than\r\nthe existing administration!”\r\n\r\nAs these words were uttered there was a murmur and a strange commotion\r\nin the place. The man with the squint left the table and quickly passed\r\nout. His companion rose and placed himself at the door, as if to check\r\nany attempt at exit. The bartender turned pale as one of his clouts\r\nbehind the bar.\r\n\r\n“Hush,” he whispered, apprehensively; “hush! You will get yourselves\r\ninto trouble and the house will lose its license.”\r\n\r\n“A pretty state of things,” retorted the Professor, “when a free\r\nAmerican citizen cannot speak his mind openly. I say it, and I don’t\r\ncare who hears me, that I am opposed to Corruption, Imperialism and\r\nTrusts!”\r\n\r\n“GO!” cried the barkeeper, with the air of a man wrought by his fears\r\nto a pitch of rage. “Out you go, I say! You can’t talk that way in\r\nhere!”\r\n\r\n“All right!” interposed Kearns, apparently much amused at the warmth\r\ndisplayed; “this gentleman has told you his views and we’ll now take\r\nour cigars, and go.”\r\n\r\n“No! no!” cried the bartender, hastily removing the cigar boxes; “go\r\nnow--quick!”\r\n\r\nBut at this instant there was a sound of feet at the entrance and\r\nthe little man with the squint reappeared, accompanied by a gorgeous\r\ncreature in uniform and cocked hat. The two stepped up to Kearns and\r\nthe Professor, while the dark man still maintained his position at the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n“Come!” said the man in uniform curtly.\r\n\r\n“Why--what do you mean?” exclaimed Kearns.\r\n\r\n“You are under arrest--both!” said the man with the squint.\r\n\r\n“Arrest!” exclaimed the Professor excitedly.\r\n\r\n“Arrest!” cried Kearns angrily. “Why, what the devil do you mean, sir?\r\nI am Thomas Kearns, of New York, and I’ll make it precious hot for you\r\nif you attempt any pleasantries with me!”\r\n\r\nThe little man regarded the speaker with an evil and contemptuous leer.\r\n\r\n“I don’t care who you be,” he said. “I arrest you both.”\r\n\r\n“For what?” interposed the Professor.\r\n\r\n“Sedition,” said the little man.\r\n\r\n“Sedition!” cried Kearns, with a guffaw; “sedition, eh? And by what\r\nauthority, pray?”\r\n\r\nThe squint in the man’s eyes became more pronounced. He made a signal\r\nto his companion at the door. The man in uniform laid his hand upon the\r\nProfessor’s arm.\r\n\r\n“By what authority?” again demanded Kearns.\r\n\r\nThe man threw back his coat and displayed a resplendent badge. Then\r\ncame the answer to Kearns’ question:\r\n\r\n“IN THE NAME OF THE KING!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nA STRANGE REVELATION\r\n\r\n\r\n“In the name of the King!” cried Kearns, half indignantly, half amused.\r\n“I’m sure I don’t understand what you’re driving at; but from that\r\nbadge I take it you represent the Law, and the Law I am always willing\r\nto obey. I’ll go with you; but I warn you, you’ll suffer for this work!”\r\n\r\nThe two men made no reply to this threat, but placing themselves on\r\neither side of him they marched out of the place, followed by the man\r\nin uniform, with Dean in charge. As they passed along the street,\r\nseveral loiterers and a number of small boys followed in their wake.\r\nThe prisoners seemed to arouse the greatest curiosity.\r\n\r\nTheir captors hurried them along at a rapid gait to a neat stone\r\nbuilding, with two imposing green lamps outside. Up a short flight of\r\nstone steps the prisoners were hustled and into a spacious room, where\r\nbehind a large desk sat a man in uniform. Before the desk the party\r\nlined up.\r\n\r\n“Is this the Sergeant?” asked Kearns, surveying curiously the official\r\nuniform.\r\n\r\n“Lieutenant,” curtly answered the man behind the desk. “What’s the\r\ncharge?” he asked sharply, turning to the little man with the squint.\r\n\r\n“Treasonable and seditious utterances in a public place, Lieutenant,”\r\nanswered the little man glibly. “Utterances in violation of the statute\r\nand against the peace of His Majesty, the King, his crown and dignity.”\r\n\r\n“Did you take exact note of these utterances?” asked the official.\r\n\r\n“I did, Lieutenant.”\r\n\r\n“Give them.”\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the command, the man gave a fairly faithful repetition\r\nof the words uttered by the Professor in the bar-room.\r\n\r\nHe who was addressed as Lieutenant looked serious.\r\n\r\n“Your name,” he demanded of Kearns.\r\n\r\n“Thomas Kearns,” was the answer, impressively given; “and I’m chief of\r\ndetectives of the New York police.”\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant glanced up quickly, with an astonished look.\r\n\r\n“My name isn’t unfamiliar, perhaps,” continued Mr. Kearns with some\r\nsarcasm.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant laughed softly.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he replied, “the name is familiar to me. So is that of Captain\r\nKidd, and other legendary heroes of the past. Thomas Kearns, eh? There\r\nisn’t a small boy in the country who doesn’t know the name and who\r\nhasn’t read of his exploits.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment Kearns stood silent, as if he hardly gathered the sense of\r\nthe words. Then his face flushed and he found voice.\r\n\r\n“You talk about the past,” he said, in incisive tones. “I don’t\r\nunderstand you. I am the Chief of the Department I have named--right\r\nnow--at this present moment; and that fact, I think, you’ll not find\r\ndisputed by any member of the Uniformed Force, be his rank what it may.\r\nIf you have any doubt, I would suggest that you telephone to Official\r\nHeadquarters in New York.”\r\n\r\n“Telephone!” ejaculated the Lieutenant. Again he laughed amusedly.\r\n\r\n“I said telephone,” retorted Kearns sharply. “Perhaps,” he added\r\nscornfully, “you are not equipped with such an instrument here!”\r\n\r\n“Scarcely,” answered the Lieutenant with a sniff, casting his eye\r\ntoward a handsome looking instrument at the further end of the room. “A\r\ntelephone, eh? Yes, I remember some time ago seeing one displayed as a\r\ncuriosity at the Eden Musee in New York. Quite an interesting antique!”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Kearns sternly; “I haven’t time to bandy foolish words with\r\nyou. My friend and I are tired and we wish to go home at once. I want\r\nto ask you what kind of a charge this is upon which your men have dared\r\nto arrest two reputable citizens.”\r\n\r\n“Unless the Medical Examiner declares them irresponsible,” answered the\r\nLieutenant sarcastically, “the two reputable citizens are likely to\r\nfind this matter pretty serious before they get through with it.”\r\n\r\n“This is outrageous!” exclaimed Kearns, his anger rising. “Your\r\nbehavior, sir, is infamous. If you occupied a similar position in the\r\ncity to that which you do here, I would have you brought up on charges\r\nand reduced to the ranks for such conduct.”\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant paid no heed to this outbreak.\r\n\r\n“Your residence?” he demanded in formal tones.\r\n\r\nBefore Kearns could reply, the door of the station-house was thrown\r\nhurriedly open and a tall, portly man, with red face, iron gray hair\r\nand side whiskers, bustled in. The Lieutenant turned his eyes toward\r\nthe new-comer and then raised his hand in military salute.\r\n\r\n“Are these the prisoners?” asked the arrival, walking over to the desk.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Colonel,” answered the Lieutenant.\r\n\r\n“They were found on my estate?”\r\n\r\n“No, Colonel; they were arrested at Tomlinson’s.”\r\n\r\n“I understand; but they were originally found on my lands.”\r\n\r\n“That I know nothing about, Colonel. I----”\r\n\r\n“What do they say--what have you found out about them?” interrupted the\r\nColonel eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Nothing as yet. I was about to take the record when you came in.”\r\n\r\n“I will question them myself,” said the Colonel. He turned to the\r\nprisoners. His manner betrayed a certain curiosity and eagerness, but\r\nhis tone was kindly and gentle.\r\n\r\n“How did you come to be where you were found?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“The confounded Doctor!” blurted out Kearns impatiently.\r\n\r\n“The Doctor, eh!” exclaimed the Colonel with interest. “What doctor?\r\nTell me about him.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” answered Kearns, hesitating, “the circumstances are somewhat\r\npeculiar and I don’t know that either my friend or myself care to\r\nfigure as the heroes of a sensational newspaper story.”\r\n\r\n“I beg you,” said the Colonel with great earnestness, “to speak out at\r\nonce. I believe it to be important--extremely important that you should\r\ndo so.”\r\n\r\nKearns still hesitated.\r\n\r\n“Oh, tell the gentleman the state of the case, by all means,” exclaimed\r\nthe Professor. “I feel really quite tired and exhausted and am anxious\r\nto get as quickly as possible out of this dilemma.”\r\n\r\n“Tired--exhausted!” cried the Colonel. He turned to the Lieutenant.\r\n“Give them chairs. If what I suspect be true, it is of the highest\r\nimportance that no mishap should occur to them!”\r\n\r\nChairs were procured for the two prisoners and, when they were seated,\r\nDean turned to his companion. “Speak out and end this situation,” he\r\nagain urged.\r\n\r\n“All right,” assented Kearns. Without further delay he narrated their\r\nexperiences with the Doctor in the cave. The Colonel listened with\r\nextraordinary interest.\r\n\r\n“And so,” said Kearns in conclusion, “if this is really the month of\r\nJuly, as I’ve been told, we must have slept, or been in a condition of\r\nsuspended animation, as that confounded Doctor called it, for a period\r\nof six weeks. But, tell me, what is the date?”\r\n\r\nBut the Colonel, who was looking at the prisoners with absorbed\r\ninterest, did not answer. Instead, he put the following question,\r\nbending forward in eager anxiety for the reply:\r\n\r\n“Can you tell me the date when you went into that cave and entered into\r\nthat--ah--sleep you have described?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” answered Kearns. “It was June the tenth.”\r\n\r\n“June the tenth of what year?”\r\n\r\n“June the tenth, nineteen hundred, of course.”\r\n\r\n“What!”\r\n\r\n“Whew!”\r\n\r\nBoth the Colonel and the Lieutenant uttered exclamations. The Colonel\r\nwas red and excited; the Lieutenant half rose from his seat behind the\r\ndesk. The prisoners stared in astonishment. What could there be so very\r\nextraordinary in the simple statement they had made?\r\n\r\nThere was a dead pause for a moment. Then the Colonel again turned to\r\nthe Lieutenant.\r\n\r\n“This is certainly very strange--very wonderful,” he said. “They must\r\nbe taken in hand pending developments. Care must be taken of them--that\r\nthey do not succumb----”\r\n\r\n“What is so strange--what is it that is so wonderful?” broke in the\r\nProfessor.\r\n\r\nBut the Colonel disregarded the question.\r\n\r\n“I will take them with me--to my place,” he continued, addressing the\r\nLieutenant. “They will be properly cared for there.”\r\n\r\n“But the charge! How about the charge which has been preferred against\r\nthem?”\r\n\r\n“As a county magistrate, I am empowered to admit them to bail.”\r\n\r\n“That’s true, Colonel.”\r\n\r\n“Let the charge stand. For the time being, I permit them to go on their\r\nown recognizance. I will take care of them.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, Colonel. Will you please sign the necessary papers?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; give them to me.”\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant handed the Colonel a paper and a pen and the latter\r\nhastily scratched a signature. Then he turned to Kearns and the\r\nProfessor.\r\n\r\n“Come with me,” he said.\r\n\r\nBut Kearns demurred.\r\n\r\n“Will you excuse me, Colonel,” he said; “but both my friend and myself\r\nwant to go without further delay to our own place. We’ve not the\r\nadvantage of your acquaintance, and I’m sure I don’t understand the\r\nmeaning of these proceedings.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve been arrested on a serious charge,” said the Colonel gravely,\r\nbut with good humor, “and you’re practically parolled in my custody.\r\nI don’t see what you can very well do, except take advantage of my\r\nhospitality, or adopt the unpleasant alternative of a cell.”\r\n\r\n“But,” began Kearns with indignation, “I must assure you that----”\r\n\r\n“I beg you not to excite yourselves,” exclaimed the Colonel, as one\r\nmight seek to quiet a fractious child. “It might be very bad for\r\nyou--even fatal, under the circumstances. No one can tell what might\r\nhappen, I assure you! Be content to come with me.”\r\n\r\n“Let us go with the gentleman,” urged the Professor.\r\n\r\n“Oh, very well,” answered Kearns. “I have no objection to seeing the\r\nadventure through to the end.”\r\n\r\n“Come, Bowman, come, Walker,” said the Colonel, turning to the\r\ncross-eyed man and his companion; “assist them to my phaeromobile.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think we need assistance, thank you,” said the Professor,\r\nrising and waving away the tall dark man.\r\n\r\n“Assistance, indeed!” exclaimed Kearns as he repulsed the cross-eyed\r\nman. “I should say not!”\r\n\r\n“But you might fall! Pray be careful!” urged the Colonel with officious\r\nkindness.\r\n\r\n“I may if I don’t get something to eat pretty soon,” laughed Kearns.\r\n\r\n“Yes; it is certainly high time we ate,” declared the Professor.\r\n\r\n“Ah, just as I feared!” remarked the Colonel anxiously.\r\n\r\nBy this time they had passed through the door of the station-house.\r\nOutside stood one of those curious looking machines which Kearns and\r\nthe Professor had seen rushing past them on the highway. On the front\r\nseat sat a man, apparently the driver. Behind him, in the body of the\r\nvehicle, were seats for four persons.\r\n\r\n“Step in,” said the Colonel cheerily. Turning to the cross-eyed man and\r\nhis companion, he added warningly:\r\n\r\n“Keep your mouths closed as to this matter. Not a word for the\r\npresent!”\r\n\r\nThe two men thus addressed clicked their heels together and saluted.\r\n\r\n“Home,” said the Colonel to the driver, stepping into the vehicle, “but\r\nnot too fast!”\r\n\r\nThe driver saluted, turned a lever and they were off.\r\n\r\n“And now for a few words of explanation,” said Kearns to the Colonel.\r\n\r\n“Not a word, my good friends,” said the Colonel with soothing\r\npatronage, “until you are thoroughly restored--invigorated--out of\r\ndanger!”\r\n\r\n“Out of danger?” exclaimed Kearns mystified.\r\n\r\n“What may be your meaning, sir?” inquired the Professor.\r\n\r\nBoth stared at him as if he were a good-natured lunatic.\r\n\r\n“After six weeks of fasting,” said the Colonel diplomatically, “a man\r\nshould be willing to go quietly to a meal, I think.”\r\n\r\nThey had passed beyond the limits of the town and, having reached the\r\nhighway, were flying along at a rapid rate. Such was their speed that\r\nKearns and the Professor were not loth to hold their tongues and attend\r\nto the matter of breathing. Along the road they flew, finally turning\r\ndown a side road and drawing up in front of an ornamented iron gate,\r\nopened to them by a lodge keeper; then down a winding path, bordered\r\nby trees, until they stopped before the steps of a stately house. The\r\nColonel stepped out of the vehicle.\r\n\r\n“Welcome to Idleslip!” he said as he politely assisted them to alight.\r\n\r\nHe led the way up the steps, across a spacious foyer and turned into\r\none of the rooms to the left. Drawing up two comfortable armchairs, he\r\nmotioned them to be seated.\r\n\r\n“Do you feel very weak?” he inquired with anxious concern. “Shall I\r\norder you some refreshment, or don’t you think it would be better to\r\nwait for the doctor?”\r\n\r\n“Doctor!” cried Kearns. “I thank you. I have had all the doctor I want\r\nfor some time to come.”\r\n\r\n“Doctor!” exclaimed the Professor, who regarded the question in a\r\ndifferent light. “Let us cease playing at cross-purposes. May I ask you\r\nfrankly, sir, why you think we need a physician?”\r\n\r\n“Pray calm yourselves,” urged the Colonel soothingly, “or, as I have\r\nalready warned you, no one can foresee the results! See a doctor? Why\r\nnot! After your remarkable--I may say, indeed, very extraordinary\r\nexperiences----”\r\n\r\n“You refer to our sleep in the cave?” interposed the Professor. “By the\r\nway, is it really possible that we have slept six weeks? What is the\r\ndate?”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” protested the Colonel. “Don’t seek any explanation now. Wait\r\nuntil later.”\r\n\r\n“But this delay is exasperating,” persisted the Professor. “All these\r\nstrange happenings--this mystery--play upon my nerves! I must insist\r\nupon an immediate explanation. I must ask you, Colonel--Colonel--pardon\r\nme, but what is the name?”\r\n\r\n“I am Colonel, Sir Maynard Cuming.”\r\n\r\n“_Sir_ Maynard Cuming!” repeated Kearns mystified.\r\n\r\n“_Sir_ Maynard Cuming!” exclaimed the Professor, passing his hand over\r\nhis eyes. “Let me ask you--is this the Republic of the United States,\r\nor have we in our sleep, or trance, been spirited into some foreign\r\nland?”\r\n\r\n“The Republic of the United States?” said the Colonel with a curious\r\nsmile; “Well--no!”\r\n\r\nKearns and the Professor rose to their feet. Kearns’ eyes were\r\ndilated, his hands clenched. The Professor was very pale.\r\n\r\n“Speak!” he said. “What country is this and--the date--what?”\r\n\r\n“Be calm,” urged the Colonel. “It’s not well you should be told these\r\nthings now. Wait until later!”\r\n\r\nThe Professor advanced a step and spoke with all the concentrated\r\nenergy of a thoroughly aroused man.\r\n\r\n“Tell me the truth now,” he said, “or I’ll leave at once and seek it\r\nelsewhere.”\r\n\r\nThe Colonel realized the situation had reached a climax. Something must\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\n“Since you will have it so,” he replied gravely, “I will answer you.\r\nPrepare yourselves to hear calmly, bravely.”\r\n\r\n“Go on!” cried Kearns breathlessly.\r\n\r\n“You are at present,” answered the Colonel, speaking very slowly and\r\ndistinctly, “upon my estate at Idleslip, seven miles from the county\r\nseat of Pemberton. You are in the Empire of the United States, within\r\nthe realm of His Majesty, Imperial and Royal, William the First,\r\nEmperor of the United States, King of the Empire State of New York!”\r\n\r\nHis two auditors were staring at him wide-eyed, speechless. It was\r\ndifficult to decide whether they took in the full sense of his words.\r\n\r\n“The date,” continued the Colonel with enforced calm, “is July the\r\ntwenty-fifth, nineteen hundred and seventy-five. You say you entered\r\nthe cave June tenth, nineteen hundred. If your statement is correct,\r\nyou have been in a state of suspended animation for seventy-five\r\nyears!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nSEARCHING THE FILES\r\n\r\n\r\nSeventy-five years!\r\n\r\nFor a moment both men stood breathless, stupefied. A groan was stifled\r\nupon Kearns’ lips and he leaned heavily upon the table for support. The\r\nProfessor stared blankly at the speaker, then put both hands to his\r\nface and dropped back in his chair.\r\n\r\nWas this some grim and ghastly joke; some hideous vagary of delirium,\r\nor the night?\r\n\r\nAlas, no!\r\n\r\nThe events through which they had passed; the unfamiliar scenes\r\nencountered; the appurtenances of the very room in which they sat;\r\nthe manner of the Colonel--all proclaimed the absence of illusion and\r\nconfirmed the existence of stern reality.\r\n\r\nSeventy-five years!\r\n\r\nTruly, only a brief span in the cycle of time, in the relentlessly\r\nautomatic passage of the ages, but how much in the individual life of\r\nman. Seventy-five years ago--who inhabited the house, the spot, in\r\nwhich we live? What was our particular ancestor doing; what was he\r\nlike; what were his thoughts, ideas, aspirations, hopes, ambitions,\r\nthis day just seventy-five years ago? How many hustling, bustling,\r\nhoping, fearing, aspiring men and women who have since passed away and\r\nof whom to-day there is not a human being who knows that they ever were\r\non earth. And--seventy-five years hence! Who will then occupy the\r\nhouse, the spot where we to-day live? Who then, as the days sweep by,\r\nwill ever give a passing thought to us, or perchance even remember we\r\never existed?\r\n\r\nSo, then, three-quarters of a century had passed and with the passage\r\nof time surroundings and conditions had also changed! And these two\r\nfortunate, or unfortunate, derelicts of the past--what of them? They\r\nwere as relics of a bygone age; a species of human flotsam and jetsam\r\ncast up upon a foreign shore.\r\n\r\nA sort of homesickness, a deadly nostalgia, was upon them.\r\nInstinctively they turned to each other for sympathy.\r\n\r\nKearns, with his stronger vitality and naturally high spirits, was\r\nthe quicker to recover from the shock. He glanced down at his strong,\r\nknotted arm and wrist resting on the table. Even if he had been dead\r\nto the world for all these years, even if he was over a century old,\r\nhis muscles were as strong as ever and the flow of life within him\r\napparently unimpaired. And if a man’s nerves have the courage and his\r\nheart beats strong and full as at thirty, what matter how many years\r\nhave passed over his head! Such was the thought which surged through\r\nKearns’ mind. “A woman is as old as she looks, a man is as old as he\r\nfeels,” was the inconsequent and frivolous idea which kept jangling\r\nthrough his brain. How strange it is that in the most critical moments\r\nof our lives, the incongruous and the odd will persist in obtruding\r\nthemselves upon our mental perception.\r\n\r\nFrom the chaos of emotion the announcement had developed in Kearns,\r\ncuriosity began to grow. He roused himself and turned to question the\r\nColonel. But the latter proved obdurate.\r\n\r\n“Not another word will I tell you,” he declared; “not another word\r\nuntil medical advice is at hand. You can understand the loss to the\r\nworld and to science should anything happen to you at this stage. I’ve\r\nsent for the doctor. He’ll be here shortly.”\r\n\r\nAs the Colonel spoke there came a rap on the door and the servant\r\nannounced the arrival of the Doctor.\r\n\r\n“Show him in at once,” ordered the Colonel. An instant later a very\r\nbrisk little man, with red cheeks, black moustache and side whiskers,\r\nentered the room.\r\n\r\n“Doctor Robinson O’Hanlenne,” announced the Colonel, who proceeded\r\nto explain briefly the circumstances to the new arrival. From the\r\nColonel’s narrative it appeared that two of his workmen had been\r\nfelling trees and laying out certain ground in a distant and hitherto\r\nunused portion of his estate. While thus engaged they had found the\r\ncave with the two inanimate forms carefully wrapped in rugs lying\r\nwithin. The Colonel told graphically the terror of the men as the\r\nsupposed corpses revived, and their flight when a horse and carriage\r\nwere demanded by Kearns.\r\n\r\n“A horse and carriage!” exclaimed the Doctor, with a smile.\r\n\r\n“Precisely; a horse and carriage!”\r\n\r\nAnd both laughed.\r\n\r\n“The two men,” continued the Colonel, “ran to the foreman. Fortunately\r\nI happened to be with him. At the men’s story I hurried to the cave.\r\nThe peculiar and elaborate appointments of it astonished me. In a\r\nlittle side recess I found some curious notes and papers bearing on\r\nthe subject of mesmeric forces and suspension of animation. From the\r\nground I picked up a piece of money. It bore the date eighteen hundred\r\nand seventy-six. ‘Come,’ said I to myself, ‘this piece of money must\r\nhave been coined at the time of the Presidency of the famous soldier,\r\nGeneral Grant. Such money is surely not in general circulation now!’\r\nAll of these strange occurrences began to give me a faint hint of the\r\ntruth. Such cases are not entirely unknown to our modern science, I\r\nbelieve, although the duration of the sleep in this instance exceeds\r\nanything yet reported.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so,” commented Dr. O’Hanlenne.\r\n\r\n“I started on a hunt for my involuntary guests,” continued the Colonel,\r\nwith a smile at Kearns and the Professor. “On the Pemberton road I\r\nluckily encountered Mrs. Merriweather and her daughter, who had met\r\ntwo men who asked after strange places. These men had actually made\r\ninquiries for a horse and carriage.”\r\n\r\nBoth the Colonel and the Doctor broke into a guffaw.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” interjected the Professor. “I remember the old woman--a\r\nqueer sort of person who talked about fourteen and fifteen o’clock and\r\nhad never heard of a Presidential election.”\r\n\r\nAgain the Colonel and the Doctor laughed.\r\n\r\n“So you thought her language queer, did you?” exclaimed the Colonel.\r\n“Fourteen and fifteen o’clock sound strangely to your ears? Well; since\r\nyour day we have changed the nomenclature of time somewhat and I think\r\nI may say without vanity we have improved upon your methods. Instead of\r\nyour A. M. and P. M., which we moderns find awkward and cumbersome and\r\nlikely to lead to confusion in certain instances, we divide the day and\r\nnight into a straight twenty-four hours. Thus we count from midnight\r\nto midnight. One hour after noon is with us thirteen o’clock and the\r\nday closes at the last stroke of midnight, which we name twenty-four\r\no’clock. Thus it would appear that old Mrs. Merriweather was not so\r\nmuch out of the way, after all.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I see,” replied the Professor, “but may I inquire how it was that\r\nshe had never heard of the village of Averill and why so much anger on\r\nher part, and merriment on yours, over our very innocent inquiry for a\r\nconveyance?”\r\n\r\n“What kind of a conveyance was it you asked for?” inquired the Colonel,\r\nwith a merry twinkle in his eyes.\r\n\r\n“A horse and carriage, sir,” answered the Professor with dignity.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor coughed a discreet professional cough and pressed his\r\nhandkerchief to his lips in an all too evident attempt to conceal his\r\nmerriment. The Colonel laughed outright.\r\n\r\n“Averill,” said he, “as I happen to know from certain old documents I\r\nhave had occasion to examine, was an old-time village long ago absorbed\r\nby the town of Pemberton. Its very name has disappeared from local\r\nmemory. I am not astonished that Mrs. Merriweather could not recall\r\nit. As for your demand for a horse and carriage--why, my dear sir, it\r\nis many, many years since horses were used. With charging stations in\r\nevery direction and our systems of drawing electricity from the clouds,\r\nno man could afford to deal with so slow, expensive and antiquated an\r\nobject as a horse. They are still used for the purposes of racing and\r\nHis Majesty, the King, on certain state occasions sits in the royal\r\nchariot drawn by four horses, but for all ordinary uses the horse has\r\nentirely disappeared. You might as well have called for a sedan chair.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said the Professor blankly. “I suppose I should have asked for a\r\n_voiter_. What, by the way, _is_ a _voiter_?”\r\n\r\n“Simply a modernized name for vehicle,” replied the Colonel.\r\n\r\n“Do you happen to have a public official named Waring?” asked Kearns.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered the Colonel. “He is the Imperial and Royal Commissioner\r\nof Highways, and the best man for the post we have ever had! How did\r\nyou come to know of him?”\r\n\r\n“I saw him stuck up on the sign-board,” said Kearns absently.\r\n\r\n“Stuck up on the sign-board!” exclaimed the Colonel, somewhat puzzled.\r\n\r\n“Yes; his name was signed to the notice to travelers,” explained Kearns.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I see!” replied the Colonel.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Kearns regretfully, “I’m rather sorry to learn about the\r\nretirement of the horses. I was always very fond of them.”\r\n\r\n“You will find a good phaeromobile much more effective,” answered the\r\nColonel with a smile. “But,” he continued turning to the Doctor, “I\r\nmust continue my story. I followed our two friends along their course\r\nand the trail they had left was a pretty broad one. I finally traced\r\nthem to the station-house.”\r\n\r\n“The station-house!” exclaimed the Doctor.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered the Colonel; “there on a charge of seditious\r\nutterances--in the position of conspirators against the peace and\r\ndignity of His Majesty, the King.”\r\n\r\nThe Doctor laughed.\r\n\r\n“I rescued them from their perilous situation,” continued the Colonel,\r\n“and then came the most startling disclosure of all.”\r\n\r\n“Which was?” inquired the Doctor.\r\n\r\n“They then informed me,” said the Colonel solemnly, “that they had\r\nentered the cave and had been there since June the tenth, nineteen\r\nhundred!”\r\n\r\n“Since June the tenth, nineteen hundred!” exclaimed the Doctor.\r\n“Extraordinary! Marvelous! Still the case is not without some\r\nprecedents. The famous Doctor Fredicus, of Berlin, reports a case of\r\nsuspended animation lasting for ten months, but anything like the lapse\r\nof time in this case is certainly without parallel.”\r\n\r\n“I trust that you do not doubt our word,” said Kearns with dignity.\r\n\r\nBut the Professor turned upon him.\r\n\r\n“Doubt our word!” he exclaimed. “Who could credit such a preposterous\r\nstatement without some tangible evidence to support it. We must appear\r\nin the light of either falsifiers or lunatics!”\r\n\r\n“Doubt your word!” exclaimed the Colonel impulsively. “I beg you not to\r\nthink of such construction. There may be some mistake, some possible\r\ninaccuracy; but, if so, I am convinced it is entirely unintentional.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said the Professor gratefully; “I’m unable to think\r\nclearly just now owing to this very perplexing situation in which we\r\nfind ourselves, but is there not some way by which our statement could\r\nbe effectively tested and either proved, or disproved?”\r\n\r\n“A good idea!” exclaimed Kearns. “Yes; surely there must be many ways.\r\nThe newspapers, for instance; they must certainly have reported our\r\ndisappearance. In your public libraries there are undoubtedly bound\r\ncopies of the newspapers of that period. That is,” he added, turning\r\ndoubtfully to the Colonel, “if public libraries have not ceased\r\nto exist in these times, like the horse, the high ball, and other\r\ncherished institutions.”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered the Colonel, laughing, “we still have public libraries,\r\nand noble ones, thanks to numerous karnegians on the part of wealthy\r\ndecedents.”\r\n\r\n“Numerous what, did you say?” inquired Kearns.\r\n\r\n“Karnegians,” repeated the Colonel. “Oh, perhaps that’s a new\r\nword to you. ‘To karnegy’ is a verb meaning the acquirement of a\r\nmania for post-mortem advertising and for leaving one’s wealth to\r\npublic institutions, to the disappointment of one’s heirs. The noun\r\n‘karnegian’ is defined as the gift of such character. But,” continued\r\nthe Colonel, “we need not resort to the public libraries. Here in my\r\nown library, which you will find a very fair one, there are bound\r\nnewspaper files stretching back over a period of many years. The\r\ncollection was begun by my grandfather and I have hoped I might\r\ncomplete it to a full century of newspapers.”\r\n\r\n“Might we inspect the files at once?” asked the Professor.\r\n\r\n“Do you think it would be safe?” asked the Colonel, turning to the\r\nDoctor. “Would it not be better to postpone this until later and\r\nexamine your patients at once?”\r\n\r\n“Having slept seventy-five years,” replied Kearns, “I assure you we are\r\nthoroughly rested and quite up to the test.”\r\n\r\n“When I do begin my examination,” said the Doctor, “I shall want to\r\nmake it a very thorough one. I suspect I shall find that animation\r\nhas been absolutely suspended during this period and that nature will\r\nsimply resume where she left off--just as after a night’s sleep. If\r\nI refuse my patients’ request it is likely to act upon the nervous\r\nsystem and possibly throw them into an irritated and excited condition.\r\nI think we might safely look into the matter now, provided they will\r\nfirst partake of a little light nourishment.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so,” exclaimed the Colonel. “They must be fairly starved.”\r\n\r\nUnder Dr. O’Hanlenne’s directions, a light but nutritious meal was\r\npromptly served, which the two partook of with relish.\r\n\r\nThe repast over, the Colonel, followed by his guests, led the way\r\nacross the hall to the elevator. He touched an electric button and they\r\nquickly ascended two stories. The Colonel then conducted them down the\r\nhall and into a magnificent library. Books lined the four walls from\r\nfloor to ceiling.\r\n\r\n“We’ll find what we want here,” said the Colonel, crossing to one\r\ncorner of the library. “The files for that period are bound in four\r\nvolumes to the year. Let me see--we want June, nineteen hundred. That\r\nwill be the second volume of that year. Ah, here it is.”\r\n\r\nThe Colonel picked out a big volume and laid it on one of the polished\r\nlibrary tables.\r\n\r\n“June the tenth is the date, I believe? By the way,” he added, turning\r\nto Kearns, “may I ask the names?”\r\n\r\n“My name is Thomas Kearns and I am, or rather was----”\r\n\r\n“What!” exclaimed the Colonel, with a start, “not Thomas Kearns, the\r\nfamous Director of Police, the great Vidocq of that period, whose\r\nname has figured so often in the sensational romances of the writer,\r\nBranderhurst?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied Kearns modestly, “I believe I was pretty well known in\r\nconnection with police matters in my day, but you do me altogether too\r\nmuch honor. As for Branderhurst: I’m sorry, but I never heard of him!”\r\n\r\n“True,” said the Colonel, “he wrote after your day. What the French\r\nauthors did for Vidocq, Branderhurst has done for you. You are known to\r\nour girls and boys, and readers of sensational literature generally,\r\nas a Fouché and a Vidocq rolled into one. In a word, as the great\r\nAmerican Director of Secret Police.”\r\n\r\n“They didn’t quite style it that way in my day,” answered Kearns, “but\r\nI suppose it’s all right. A rose under any other name would smell just\r\nas sweet! As for Branderhurst, I’m sure I’m obliged to him for acting\r\nas a gratuitous post-mortem press agent. What can I do to repay him, I\r\nwonder!”\r\n\r\n“Not much, I fear,” replied the Colonel, “inasmuch as poor\r\nBranderhurst, who was really a very talented poet and novelist, died in\r\ndelirium tremens nearly a quarter of a century ago.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, I see,” said Kearns apologetically; “it used to be much the same\r\nthing with writers in the old days.”\r\n\r\n“And now,” inquired the Colonel, turning to the Professor, “may I ask\r\nyour name?”\r\n\r\n“Walter Stuart Dean,” answered the Professor. “And,” he added with a\r\nsmile, “I fear I cannot lay any claim to distinction such as possessed\r\nby my friend here, for in my period I was nothing but a poor pedagogue\r\nand----”\r\n\r\nBut the Professor stopped abruptly, for both the Colonel and the Doctor\r\nhad turned toward him with faces flushed and eager.\r\n\r\n“Walter Stuart Dean!” repeated the Doctor.\r\n\r\n“Walter Stuart Dean!” echoed the Colonel. “Are you the famous writer on\r\npolitical economy; the distinguished inventor and scientist?”\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” urged the Professor deprecatingly, “I beg you not to\r\nfall into any error. There is some mistake here. It is true I wrote\r\na work on political economy, but far from making me famous, it cost\r\nme my position as one of the Faculty at the Chicago University. As\r\nfor my investigations in science, whatever might have been the\r\nresult, practically it was nothing, since at the critical moment I--I\r\ndisappeared!”\r\n\r\n“Mistake, eh!” cried the Colonel, eagerly interposing; “we will see\r\nabout that!” And he hurried away to another part of the library,\r\nreturning a moment later with a big encyclopedia.\r\n\r\n“What do I find here?” he asked, consulting the index and rapidly\r\nturning over the pages. “Ah, here it is! ‘Walter Stuart Dean, political\r\neconomist, scientist and inventor; born at Springfield, Illinois,\r\n1857, of poor but honest parents. Studied in the public schools and\r\nafterward at the University of Bonn, Germany, from which he graduated,\r\n1880, with high honors. Filled the Chair of Professor of Sciences at\r\nthe University of Chicago, 1890-1900, from which he retired owing\r\nto political persecution. Wrote several famous works on political\r\neconomy and the economic conditions of the period; also a number of\r\nnotable scientific treatises. His mysterious disappearance in 1900 was\r\none of the sensations of the day. The date of his death and place of\r\nburial are unknown.’ Now, sir, what do you say to that?” exclaimed the\r\nColonel, tapping with his index finger upon the page before him. “Do\r\nyou still think there is any mistake?”\r\n\r\n“Hooray!” cried Kearns triumphantly, waving his hand in the air.\r\n“This is indeed a case of a man waking up to find himself famous. I\r\ncongratulate you, Professor.”\r\n\r\n“Let me add my felicitations,” said Dr. O’Hanlenne.\r\n\r\n“And mine!” declared the Colonel.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” replied the Professor, with the air of a man somewhat\r\ndazed.\r\n\r\n“And now,” exclaimed the Colonel, “having solidly ensconced you in\r\nyour respective niches of fame, let us continue our original line of\r\nresearch. Let us see if in these newspapers there is any account of\r\nyour mysterious disappearance.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so,” said Dr. O’Hanlenne.\r\n\r\n“June tenth,” began the Colonel, turning the paper, “no use looking on\r\nthat date. June the eleventh. Ah! here we are. Phew! your disappearance\r\ndid make a stir and your papers of that day understood the art of\r\nworking up a sensation. See the great black headlines: ‘Triple Tragedy!\r\nDeath Amid the Lightning and the Storm. Mysterious Disappearances of a\r\nFamous New Yorker and his Companion. The Whole Countryside engaged in\r\nOrganized Search for the Missing Ones.’ Well, well, well, gentlemen!\r\nWhat more could you ask than that?”\r\n\r\nAll bent eagerly over the Colonel’s shoulder and read. There was\r\nthe whole story set forth; how Kearns and the Professor had been\r\ntemporarily sojourning at Dr. Belden’s well-known Sanatorium; how in\r\nthe early afternoon of June tenth they had started out in company with\r\nDr. Jaquet; their failure to return; the search which had followed and\r\nthe finding of the dead body of Dr. Jaquet by the wayside, under the\r\ngreat oak, blasted and riven by the lightning stroke. The article went\r\non to describe how all search for the Doctor’s companions had so far\r\nproved utterly without result. Then followed biographical sketches of\r\nthe missing men.\r\n\r\nThey turned over the files and saw how day after day the papers had\r\nkept up the sensation; how rewards were offered by the many friends\r\nof Thomas Kearns for any information as to his whereabouts, living or\r\ndead. Then came the news of a monster subscription for the purpose of\r\nthoroughly dragging the rivers and otherwise continuing the search.\r\nNext came theories as to the causes of the disappearance. Had they\r\nbecome deranged and wandered away? This theory was discussed at length,\r\nbut it hardly seemed tenable that two men should have simultaneously\r\nbecome mentally afflicted. Another theory was advanced that Kearns\r\nand his companion had been made away with by an organized band of\r\nmalefactors, who either sought revenge upon Kearns or feared certain\r\ndiscoveries he might have made. Thus the news of the search and the\r\nvarious theories advanced kept up edition after edition, until the\r\narticles grew shorter and shorter and at last stopped altogether. The\r\nnine days’ wonder had ceased longer to be a wonder; the mystery had\r\npassed into the long list of unsolved tragedies with which the past\r\nteems.\r\n\r\n“What a queer thing it is,” commented Kearns with a laugh, glancing\r\nover his biography, “that a man has to be dead before the world finds\r\nout how good and great he was.”\r\n\r\n“I think you will find that has been the case in all generations,”\r\nreplied the Colonel.\r\n\r\n“And poor Dr. Jaquet!” remarked the Professor. “To think that he should\r\nhave come to his end so tragically and so suddenly after leaving us!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Kearns moodily; “our setting out that June day would\r\nseem to have been an unfortunate event for all three of us!”\r\n\r\n“Come, cheer up!” retorted the Colonel; “thank your lucky stars you\r\nare still alive and living in a world which I think you will find\r\nmaterially improved in many respects as compared to that of your time.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!” exclaimed Kearns doubtfully, “tell us then, of this new world\r\nof yours.”\r\n\r\n“Not now,” answered the Colonel; “your strength and nerves have\r\nalready been sufficiently tried. For the moment, I insist upon turning\r\nyou over to the Doctor.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF THE PAST\r\n\r\n\r\n“You ancient coxcomb!” exclaimed Kearns next morning, as he watched the\r\nProfessor struggling with the intricacies of a new-fangled necktie, “to\r\nthink of a man more than one hundred years old giving himself up to the\r\nvanities of life!”\r\n\r\n“You, too, O venerable centenarian, seem to have given some attention\r\nin the same direction,” retorted the Professor. “I must confess,\r\nthough, that those knee-breeches and hose are very becoming to you,\r\nconsidering your advanced age!”\r\n\r\n“You think so?” replied Kearns. “I must say that the clothes of this\r\nperiod are certainly more picturesque and quite as comfortable as those\r\nof our day.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he turned his eyes in the direction of an assortment of\r\nclothing which their host had sent up for their use. The styles had\r\nassuredly undergone a change from the long trousers and somber-hued\r\nclothes to which Kearns and the Professor had been accustomed.\r\nKnee-breeches and hose replaced the long trousers and the waistcoats\r\nwere in lively patterns.\r\n\r\nThey had been conducted the night before to two comfortable adjoining\r\nrooms and after being carefully examined by Dr. O’Hanlenne, had\r\npartaken of a second light repast, succeeded by a sound night’s rest.\r\nThis morning the Doctor had again visited them before they were up\r\nand, after careful examination, had pronounced their condition sound,\r\nleaving them with assurances that they could safely resume the ordinary\r\noccupations of life. Then came a servant with an invitation from their\r\nhost to join him at breakfast.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, at his guests’ urgent request, the Colonel conducted\r\nthem to the library there to impart to them information regarding the\r\nchanged order of things. Having seated them in comfortable armchairs,\r\nthe Colonel produced a box of cigars.\r\n\r\n“You smoke?” he inquired.\r\n\r\nBoth assented.\r\n\r\n“Well,” laughed the Colonel, as he passed the box, “that’s at least one\r\ncustom which you will find has not changed.”\r\n\r\nThe Colonel lighted his cigar and settled back in his chair,\r\npreparatory to opening his narrative.\r\n\r\n“As you have already learned,” he began, “this land in which we live\r\nis no longer the Republic of the United States of America. All that\r\nis changed. We live to-day in the Empire of the United States under\r\nthe beneficent rule of His Majesty, Imperial and Royal, William the\r\nFirst, Emperor of the United States, King of the Empire State of New\r\nYork, Grand Duke of Mexico and Costa Rica, Sovereign Lord of Cuba and\r\nthe Philippines, Mikado of the Province of Ling-Toa, Nihor of Benaria.\r\nThe states composing the old Republic of the United States have been\r\nconsolidated into thirty states, each of which is governed by a\r\nViceroy, excepting the Empire State of New York, of which the Emperor\r\nis King. Thus in national matters we refer to the Emperor, but in state\r\nmatters to the King.”\r\n\r\n“An Empire and an Emperor!” gasped the Professor. “The Republic gone!”\r\n\r\n“Who would ever have believed it!” cried Kearns.\r\n\r\n“To our modern thinkers and writers,” said the Colonel calmly, “the one\r\ngreat, inexplicable thing is that the people of the beginning of this\r\ncentury--the people of your time--did not plainly foresee just what has\r\nhappened. As our leading historian, Goldstream, points out, all the\r\nhistory of the past, all the indications of the times, pointed clearly\r\nto this culmination. And I agree with Goldstream that it would really\r\nseem that it did not require a prophet, or the son of a prophet, to\r\nforeshadow what actually happened.”\r\n\r\n“I am deeply interested,” said the Professor, “yet I do not quite\r\nfollow your line of reasoning. Will you particularize a little more\r\nfully, please?”\r\n\r\n“With pleasure,” answered the Colonel. “As I have just remarked,\r\nGoldstream draws attention to the fact that the history of the past\r\nall pointed to the Empire. By this he refers to the history of all the\r\nold-time republics. What has that history been? First, a republic,\r\nand honest, sturdy simplicity; next, a growth of wealth, followed by\r\na constantly increasing luxury. And what was the outcome of these\r\nconditions in all these republics? Class distinction, founded upon\r\na plutocratic basis; and official and industrial corruption born of\r\nthe wild scramble after wealth and its ostentatious fooleries. These\r\nconditions have ever proved the soil from which a ruling class has\r\nsprung, followed by a monarchy and an aristocracy. Read the ancient\r\nhistories, and there you find it recorded again and again.”\r\n\r\n“That is quite true in many respects,” said the Professor; “but what\r\nsigns do you discover in our times which foreshadowed the passing of\r\nthe Republic and the installing of the monarchical institution?”\r\n\r\n“The very first signs,” answered the Colonel, “are to be traced to the\r\nclose of the nineteenth century. As can be gleaned from the literature\r\nof that period, sons of the rich men were beginning to ape the dress,\r\nthe manners and the modes of speech of the gilded youth of England. A\r\nwave of what was then called Anglomania swept over the country. If a\r\nforeign nobleman, even a poverty-stricken German baron, or a beggarly\r\nItalian count, came into the country, he was fêted, entertained and run\r\nafter by your Society and toadied to in a manner of which the smallest\r\nLondon shopkeeper, or the humblest _bourgeois_ of the Paris _faubourgs_\r\nwould have been ashamed. If an adventurer of that period called himself\r\nmy Lord This or Sir Henry That, people straightway lost their heads\r\nand their money. I ask you if this has, or has not, been correctly\r\nreported?”\r\n\r\nKearns laughed. “What memories your words bring to me!” he said. “I\r\ncould tell you of some extraordinary cases. But don’t let me interrupt.”\r\n\r\n“The beginning of this century,” continued the Colonel, “found your\r\nRepublic of the United States growing rapidly in wealth, in luxury,\r\nand in class distinctions. The literature of the times points clearly\r\nto the existence of a class which considered itself superior to the\r\nordinary citizen. Some of the writers of the period seem to have placed\r\nthe numbers of this class at four hundred, but this originally limited\r\nnumber must certainly have largely increased later on, as new fortunes\r\nwere made and new millionaires sprang into existence.”\r\n\r\n“The Four Hundred!” exclaimed Kearns. “Why, that was originally\r\nregarded as a species of joke sprung by one Ward McAllister.”\r\n\r\n“It evidently turned out a pretty grim joke for the Republic!” retorted\r\nthe Professor dryly.\r\n\r\n“All these things were straws clearly indicating the direction to\r\nwhich the wind was veering,” resumed the Colonel. “A large percentage\r\nof the members of this class, denominated even in the days of the\r\nRepublic as ‘High Society,’ lived in Europe, where they could bask in\r\nthe sunshine of aristocracy and at times even creep within the shadow\r\nof a throne. The one dream of the members possessed of marriageable\r\ndaughters in this ‘High Society’ was to marry off such daughters to\r\nEuropean aristocrats. The multi-millionaires of the period aspired to\r\na match with an English Duke or Earl; those of lesser millions were\r\ncompelled to put up with a French Count, or a German Baron. No woman\r\nwas too beautiful, no _dot_ too great, provided a title were involved.\r\nNo personality was too repulsive, no reputation or character too\r\nvile, provided they were gilded over by a patent of nobility. Do the\r\nchronicles that tell of these things lie, or do they record the truth?”\r\n\r\n“The frozen truth!” answered Kearns curtly.\r\n\r\n“Then how can you say,” cried the Colonel triumphantly, “that the\r\ncoming events did not cast their shadows before? What meant these\r\nthings if not an aching and a longing for aristocracy? And you can’t\r\nvery well have an aristocracy without a monarchy! It is the most\r\nnatural sequence of events in the world,” continued the Colonel\r\nargumentatively; “first wealth, next luxury, then a desire to be\r\ndistinguished above the common herd. After all the physical appetites\r\nare satisfied comes the craving for honors and distinction, for\r\ndecorations and titles!”\r\n\r\n“But,” interposed the Professor with a bewildered air, “how came the\r\nPeople--the masses of the People--to ever submit to these changes?”\r\n\r\n“Tut! Tut! The People!” exclaimed the Colonel contemptuously. “How much\r\nhad they to say in the matter! The power of the People is one of those\r\ncant phrases, founded on a popular delusion, which have always existed.\r\nIn theory, the power of the People is supreme; in reality, a myth.\r\nTake it during the past two thousand years. In all these centuries the\r\ngreat masses of the people have been poor, hardworking; their lives\r\nreplete with stint and suffering. The Few have been rich, pampered,\r\nover-indulged and contented. Do you think the masses of the People\r\nwere really satisfied with this order of things? Do you not believe\r\nthat they, both as individuals and as a mass, would infinitely have\r\npreferred a more even distribution of the good things of this world?\r\nAt any time and in any country, these masses, had they been organized\r\nand united in purpose, could in a day have changed the conditions and\r\nbrought about this coveted distribution. But they never have been so\r\norganized and united, and the special class has ever governed the\r\nmasses. True, there were your labor unions and your great strikes.\r\nContractors and employers, great and small, were bullied and at times\r\neven beaten in the various struggles which ensued, but this really\r\namounted to nothing. Whenever the People really began to grow dangerous\r\nand to threaten the existing order of things, the soldiers came\r\nforth--soldiers, mark you, drawn from the masses--and the trouble was\r\npromptly put an end to.”\r\n\r\n“But how about the popular vote?” inquired the Professor.\r\n\r\n“The popular vote,” echoed the Colonel with a sneer. “Another delusion!\r\nOne set of professional politicians set up a platform against another\r\nplatform devised by another set of professional politicians and both\r\ninvite the popular vote. The good people would vote for the one, or\r\nfor the other; but how much was the popular interest, or the popular\r\nwill, really represented by either? It is true that from time to\r\ntime reformers sprang up and sought to create new parties and new\r\nissues more closely representative of the popular weal and the popular\r\nwill. How much headway did they make? Defeat by the trained political\r\norganizations, commanding ample means and patronage, was invariably the\r\nultimate fate of any such efforts. The really able man preferred to\r\naccept the existing conditions and make the best of them. He realized\r\nthe futility of such undertakings and understood that the rôle of\r\nReformer and the rôle of Martyr were only too closely allied.”\r\n\r\n“But in a supreme question,” objected the Professor, “such as the\r\noverthrow of the Republic, I should have thought that a naturally free,\r\nassertive people, such as the people of the United States, would have\r\nmade their power felt.”\r\n\r\n“Another popular fallacy!” laughed the Colonel. “The people of the\r\nUnited States are a brave people--valorous in war; pushing, clever,\r\nenterprising in times of peace. They exalt national heroes to the skies\r\none day, only to pull them down the next. They are super-sensitive to\r\nadverse criticism and delight in being told they are the greatest and\r\nbest of the earth. These are among their many little peculiarities, but\r\nto describe them as a people strongly assertive of their rights is to\r\ndescribe wrongly.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t agree with you,” said the Professor bluntly.\r\n\r\n“Look back fairly and impartially,” answered the Colonel gently, “and\r\nI think you will find my words borne out. Take New York--your own\r\ncity and in your own times. Was ever in any land, or at any period,\r\nsuch arbitrary disregard of the People’s rights submitted to with\r\npractically not a murmur of dissent? Do you question this?”\r\n\r\n“I will leave it to you to make out your own case,” retorted the\r\nProfessor.\r\n\r\n“Make out my case,” returned the Colonel with warmth; “very well,\r\nthen! Is it or is it not true that valuable franchises belonging to\r\nthe People were acquired by trick and device far below their actual\r\nvalue? Is it or is it not true that official corruption was openly\r\nand notoriously rampant on every side; that judges sat upon the\r\nbench because they were the political creatures of a political boss;\r\nnominated and elected, not because of their integrity, or knowledge\r\nof the Law, but at the behest of a party leader? The same conditions\r\nprevailed amongst the prosecuting officers, so that Justice itself\r\nwas sullied at her very fountain head. Your police force was nothing\r\nmore nor less than an organized banditti, clothed with the uniform\r\nof law and order and paid by the People; but dispensing oppression\r\nand levying blackmail right and left. Am I citing individual cases,\r\nor acts done occasionally and in secrecy? Indeed not! The chronicles\r\nof your time recite that all this was a matter of daily occurrence\r\nand common notoriety--that the very children making mud pies in your\r\ngutters knew of it. Then, too, the pages of municipal history are\r\nseared with the shameful record of an executive officer who, with\r\nothers, manipulated a corner in a certain product necessary to the rich\r\nand poor. The chronicles record how the conspirators controlling the\r\ncorner forced up the price at a time when the product was most needed\r\nto relieve suffering. The price was prohibitive to the poor. And the\r\nwomen and the little children in your teeming tenements laid down their\r\nlives--hundreds upon hundreds of them. But the corner was piling up\r\nmoney for your officer and his associates, and they heeded not the\r\ncries of death and despair. The papers of the time were replete with\r\nitemized accounts of the suffering, but none raised a hand to stop the\r\niniquity. Is this true, or does history lie?”\r\n\r\n“But the People,” exclaimed the Professor, “were not responsible--they\r\ndid not approve----”\r\n\r\n“Approve!” cried the Colonel explosively; “much credit to them for\r\nthat! Do you think the People of England, or of France, would have\r\nthus tamely submitted? Even in darkest Russia, do you not think there\r\nwould have been a few signs of lack of approval in the shape of bombs?\r\nWas there a violent ebullition of popular wrath? Was there an outbreak\r\nsuch as might have recalled the French Revolution of 1789? No; your\r\nfree and assertive citizens tamely submitted. The corporations kept\r\ntheir franchises; the men of the soiled ermine retained their positions\r\non the bench; the police force, despite investigations and exposures,\r\ncontinued, haughty and arrogant, to ply its nefarious traffic; and\r\nit is recorded that the officer to whom I have referred was allowed\r\nto quietly and profitably serve out his term. Do I state facts, or\r\nfiction?”\r\n\r\n“You are stating only the truth,” said Kearns sturdily.\r\n\r\n“And the franchises which were robbed from the People!” cried the\r\ncolonel. “What was done with them? Not content with securing these\r\nvaluable franchises infinitely below their actual worth, the holders\r\nproceeded to form corporations whose stock was watered to an absurd\r\nextent. Upon this watered stock dividends had to be earned. And how\r\nwere these dividends earned--by the transportation companies of the\r\ngreat cities, for instance? By treating the people--to whom these\r\ncompanies owed their corporate existence--like dogs, and transporting\r\nthem as they would not have dared to transport cattle. Men, women and\r\nchildren were herded in the street cars of your day as animals were\r\nnever herded. Thus year in and year out were the great and supposedly\r\nall-powerful People treated. And for what? All for the benefit of a\r\ncomparatively tiny coterie of men, who derived the profit. And the\r\nPeople submitted tamely as any band of sheep, did they not? The power\r\nof the people, indeed!”\r\n\r\n“Come, Colonel!” exclaimed the Professor; “it seems to me that you are\r\nsomewhat intolerant of the shortcomings of the people of our day.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me,” replied the Colonel hastily, “if I have said anything\r\nto offend, though I have only recited a few facts as taken from the\r\nchroniclers of your own times. Of course, we have our faults and our\r\nevils; but not such as these. Thank God, such things could not be under\r\nthe Empire! Thank God, such would not be tolerated under the beneficent\r\nrule of His Majesty, the King! Long live the Empire! God save the\r\nKing!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE STAR OF EMPIRE\r\n\r\n\r\n“You would doubtless prefer to hear how the great changes which have\r\ntaken place were brought about and learn of the events which led up\r\nto them,” continued the Colonel. “For this we must go back to the\r\nbeginning of the century and the days when the various great Trusts\r\nbegan to grow into maturity and strength. Just prior to the beginning\r\nof the century had come the formation of the gigantic financial\r\norganizations known as the Trusts. That is to say, they were regarded\r\nas gigantic in that day, though as a matter of fact they had not yet\r\nassumed the really colossal proportions they later attained. They were\r\nthen in their infancy, so to speak.”\r\n\r\n“I can recall,” remarked Kearns, “a little billion-dollar concern.\r\nSurely that was a pretty solid, bouncing infant!”\r\n\r\n“A beggarly, puny infant?” retorted the Colonel, “as compared to\r\nthose born later. The Trusts grew until business upon anything but a\r\ncolossal scale was an impossibility and the smaller manufacturer and\r\nthe middleman were wiped out. In the course of time, by a brilliant\r\nseries of consolidations, seven great Trusts were formed which\r\npractically absorbed the business of the country. The fields covered\r\nby these Trusts were respectively: Alimentation, Transportation,\r\nManufacturing, Land, Ores and Minerals, Retailing, and finally, the\r\ngreat Miscellaneous Trust which took in pretty well everything not\r\nembraced by the others. These main Trusts subdivided their respective\r\nfields between numerous subsidiary Trusts; but these subsidiary Trusts\r\nall operated subject to the direction of the general head of that\r\nparticular Trust. The methods adopted by these organizations involved\r\nthe ruthless crushing out of all outside competition. For instance,\r\nthe Retailing Trust would start in by founding baker shops all over\r\na given city, and would sell bread at the actual cost of production.\r\nWith the enormous resources at the disposal of the Trust, this plan\r\nof operations could be kept up indefinitely. What was the result? All\r\nrivals were forced either to sell out to the Trust, or go to the wall.\r\nSimilar methods of procedure were adopted in other branches of retail\r\nindustry, one after the other, until the cream of the retail trade in\r\nall the great cities was practically in the hands of the Trust. It was\r\na case of steady absorption. To oppose the Trust meant ruin and this\r\nspeedily came to be very thoroughly understood. Another example is the\r\nAlimentation Trust, which deals with the foodstuffs, both solid and\r\nliquid, of the country. With its enormous resources, it was enabled\r\nto corner the raw material in one product after another until all\r\ncompetition was forced out of existence.”\r\n\r\n“And what did the People say to all this?” inquired Dean.\r\n\r\n“They fussed and fumed a good deal,” answered the Colonel, “but they\r\nsubmitted--just as they submitted in your day to the cornering Chief\r\nMagistrate, the corrupt judges, the official rascality, and the\r\noppressions of the transportation companies. At first, inspired by\r\nthe fulminations of certain newspapers, organs of the populace, they\r\nassumed a rather threatening attitude; but this soon died out. The\r\ngreat Miscellaneous Trust founded newspapers, covering immense fields\r\nof news. The highest talent in the land was employed. The papers were\r\ndelivered free of charge throughout the city and surrounding country.\r\nMoney was no object. The dry-goods business, the soap industry and\r\nthe patent-medicine output being all controlled by the Trusts, the\r\nfield of general advertising was well in their hands. Consequently the\r\nindependent newspapers were either sold out to and absorbed by the\r\nTrust organs, or perished from lack of advertising patronage.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll bet they said some tart things before they expired,” exclaimed\r\nKearns.\r\n\r\n“Frantic were their death shrieks!” replied the Colonel. “However, as\r\nthese disturbing factors gradually disappeared, the people became more\r\ncalm and more accustomed to the existing state of things. They began\r\nto perceive that the Trusts were, after all, not an unmixed evil.\r\nWhile the Trusts made enormous profits, yet the cost to the consumer,\r\nowing to the reduction in the expenses of handling and production, was\r\nmaterially reduced. The merchants and manufacturers, the middlemen and\r\nretailers who had been crowded out of business found positions with\r\nthe different Trusts, where they worked less hard and had more freedom\r\nfrom financial cares than they had known when they were in business\r\nfor themselves. And the Trusts were very shrewd. While the bulk of\r\ntheir enormous capital stock was controlled by certain individuals, yet\r\na quantity of the stock was put out among the masses of the people,\r\nwhose interest in this way became bound up with the Trusts. Besides\r\nthis, each of the Trusts, of course, employed vast armies of people.\r\nThese employes, after attaining a certain age, were pensioned and\r\ntheir lives insured, in consideration of payments deducted from the\r\nweekly, or monthly, wage. This created a vast host of people throughout\r\nthe land whose financial interests, or whose entire future prospects,\r\nwere identified with the Trusts. Now, self-interest is a very powerful\r\nincentive and these very people were among the firmest supporters of\r\nthe Trusts. In the meantime, the United States was rapidly taking\r\nits position as the foremost commercial, manufacturing and exporting\r\ncountry in the world, and this expansion of trade kept times good and\r\nthings prosperous generally. Do you follow me?”\r\n\r\n“To quite an extent,” answered Kearns.\r\n\r\n“There are many questions I wish to ask,” said the Professor, “but I\r\nprefer to reserve them until later and not interrupt your narrative.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” continued the Colonel. “We now come to the year 1963--the\r\ntime of the outbreak of the great battle of the Trusts. At that period,\r\nWilliam Rockingham, the richest man in the world and the head of the\r\ngreat Miscellaneous Trust, was President of the United States. He was\r\nthe last to fill that office. For a number of years there had been\r\ndiscord between the Directorates of certain of the seven great Trusts,\r\ngrowing out of charges and counter charges of one infringing upon the\r\nfields of the other. The discord developed into war. It was a war of\r\nbillions. For a long time the strife raged, but at last it became plain\r\nwith whom victory would rest. The defeated ones, men of resources and\r\nof influence, in the bitterness of defeat, brought charges against\r\nthe President and sought to impeach him. It was charged that he had\r\nused his official position as President to secure the victory to the\r\nMiscellaneous Trust, of which he was the head, and its allies. A\r\nbitter political fight ensued, followed by an armed uprising.”\r\n\r\n“The term of the President,” continued the Colonel, “was drawing\r\nto a close and preparations being made for the usual presidential\r\nnominations. The heads of the great Trusts, flushed by their recent\r\nsuccess, got together and the cry went up that the constantly recurring\r\nelections were a cause of commercial disturbance and that a frequently\r\nchanging occupant of the presidential chair was a source of national\r\ninsecurity and of weakness in the country’s foreign relations. The\r\npoliticians were set to work and a constitutional amendment proposed,\r\nin accordance with which the President was to be elected for life and\r\nCongress was authorized to institute such other changes in the national\r\nform of government as might be deemed necessary for the public welfare\r\nand safety. William Rockingham received the nomination from the party\r\nwhich advocated these constitutional changes. I will not analyze how\r\nit came to pass. The election which ensued was a complete triumph for\r\nhim. The constitutional amendment was sanctioned by the popular vote\r\nand William Rockingham found himself elected President for life, with a\r\nCongress, under the leadership of the great Marquanna, obedient to his\r\nlightest word.”\r\n\r\n“The opening wedge!” commented Dean.\r\n\r\n“There were charges advanced in connection with this election,” resumed\r\nthe Colonel, “and the uprising I have mentioned became more formidable\r\nthan ever. Rumors began to be circulated broadcast that certain classes\r\nwere paving the way to a monarchy. With a permanent President and a\r\nCongress obedient to his every behest, the country might as well, the\r\ncry went up, have a King at once.”\r\n\r\n“I begin to see the trend of events,” murmured Dean.\r\n\r\n“A King at once! And why not?” continued the Colonel. “The country was\r\ncertainly ripe for it. The successful Trust controllers favored it\r\nand behind them, as I have shown, were armies of people whose entire\r\ninterests were bound up in the Trusts and who, consequently, favored\r\nwhatever the Trusts desired. The officers of the Army and of the Navy\r\nfavored it. Class distinction had ever flourished in their ranks and a\r\nmonarchy would mean that crosses and decorations and all the brilliancy\r\nand advantages of a court, as enjoyed by military and naval officers\r\nin Europe, would be theirs. Society, of course, was in favor of it to\r\na unit and to the great majority of the women throughout the land the\r\nproposition seemed to come as a not displeasing novelty. In a word,\r\nwhile there was bitter opposition to the idea in many quarters, yet it\r\ndid not want for enthusiastic supporters in countless directions. As\r\nfor Marquanna, the great political chieftain, he boldly came out with\r\nthe declaration that the feature of a constantly changing President\r\nhad become intolerable and that the country’s urgent need was greater\r\nstability and permanence in its executive head. He was not prepared\r\nto say whether the mere election of the President for life would\r\nsufficiently satisfy the country’s demands in this respect.”\r\n\r\n“A bold leader! He had at least courage, if nothing else!” remarked\r\nDean.\r\n\r\n“Owing to the condition of unrest in various parts of the country,”\r\ncontinued the Colonel, “martial law was proclaimed and the regular\r\narmy was brought into active play. In the midst of the general turmoil\r\nand confusion, Congress, under the leadership of Marquanna, decided to\r\ntake advantage of the recent constitutional amendment which provided\r\nthat such other and further action might be taken in modifying the\r\nform of national government as for the welfare and safety of the people\r\nmight be deemed necessary. Boldly the resolution was sprung providing\r\nthat the existing Republic be transformed into a hereditary monarchy,\r\nwith the life President as the Sovereign. By a substantial majority\r\nthis was carried. A cabinet was quickly formed; the boundaries of\r\nthe various states were rearranged and the number of states reduced\r\nby consolidation to thirty, with a Viceroy governing each; New York\r\nstate was declared the premier state, with the Ruler of the Empire as\r\nits hereditary King, and the seat of government was transferred from\r\nWashington to New York; Marquanna was created Duke of Marquanna, taking\r\nhis title from the beautiful country seat which bears his family name,\r\nand was also made Chancellor of the Empire; crosses and orders were\r\ndistributed among the officers of the Army and the Navy, and the great\r\nmen of the country were ennobled according to their respective degrees\r\nof prominence and influence. Within sixty days the uprisings were\r\nsuccessfully crushed out by the army and the leaders and instigators\r\ntried on charges of High Treason and executed, or imprisoned. Then\r\nsprang into existence the most brilliant and luxurious Court the world\r\nhad yet known. With imposing ceremonies the first American monarch\r\nwas crowned, amid the applauding tributes of the Kings and peoples of\r\nmonarchical Europe.”\r\n\r\n“And this is the--the--King who now rules?” asked Dean.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the Colonel. “His Majesty, William the First, has since\r\nthen reigned and his reign has been one glorious in war and successful\r\nin peace, as I shall have occasion to explain to you later. The King\r\nis a man of great capabilities--able, sagacious and of strong will,\r\nbut of late years he has grown very fond of the gayeties of life, so\r\nmuch so that, like Charles II. of England, he is often referred to as\r\n‘The Merry Monarch.’ The brilliancy of his Court has grown apace, and\r\nindeed it exceeds that of any other reigning sovereign. But amid all\r\nthis glitter and gayety the affairs of State are well looked after. The\r\nofficers of the Chancellerie are in the palace itself, and still at the\r\nhelm is the stern old Chancellor--the great American Lord Chancellor,\r\nHis Grace, the Duke of Marquanna.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE POT CALLS THE KETTLE BLACK\r\n\r\n\r\n“And who was the most beautiful woman of that time and--and--what did\r\nshe look like? Oh, do tell me all about it. I’m so interested!”\r\n\r\nSo prattled away Beatrice, daughter of Colonel Sir Maynard Cuming,\r\nsprightly and eighteen, as she sat at the head of the breakfast table,\r\nand daintily served Kearns and the Professor with their tea. The\r\nColonel was a widower and this little lady--half woman, half child\r\nstill--with her handsome dark eyes and arch, impetuous ways was his\r\nonly daughter.\r\n\r\n“Do tell me all about it,” she continued pleadingly. “I want to know\r\nall about her. The books--histories and things like that--tell a lot\r\nof things which are not at all interesting and leave out the most\r\nimportant things of all. Who was the most beautiful woman?”\r\n\r\nBoth Kearns and the Professor seemed quite perplexed.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel laughed. “Now you are confronted with a poser,” he said.\r\n“This might be a rather awkward question under some circumstances, but\r\nyou can certainly answer it without danger of making any particular\r\nlady jealous.”\r\n\r\n“Now, papa,” protested Beatrice, “please don’t interrupt and lead away\r\nfrom my question.”\r\n\r\n“I fear it is useless to appeal to me, Miss Cuming,” finally answered\r\nthe Professor. “My friend, I imagine, is better qualified to answer\r\nsuch a question.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t know about that!” exclaimed Kearns; “I’ve noticed that you\r\nscientists, for all your air of scientific abstraction, have very often\r\nan exceedingly keen eye to feminine charms and graces. Who was the most\r\nbeautiful woman? How can one answer such a question when all the women\r\nof--of--our day were so beautiful! In those days, to walk up Broadway\r\nfrom Twenty-third to Thirty-fourth streets, on a bright afternoon, was\r\nto see a galaxy of American beauty and Paris fashions pass in review.”\r\n\r\n“Broadway, between Twenty-third and Thirty-fourth streets,” repeated\r\nMiss Beatrice. “Where is that, papa?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my dear,” answered the Colonel, “that’s a part of the city given\r\nover entirely to the business section. You have never been there.”\r\n\r\n“I see!” answered Beatrice thoughtfully. “But what did you say about\r\nParis fashions, Mr. Kearns? Did the ladies in those days get their\r\nfashions from Paris?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed,” answered Kearns. “Paris was then considered the great\r\ncentre from which all the fashions in dresses and bonnets were\r\nprocured.”\r\n\r\n“What a funny idea!” laughed the girl. “To-day,” she continued proudly,\r\n“our capital and our Court give the fashions to the world.”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad to learn it,” exclaimed Kearns with enthusiasm. “It should\r\nhave been the same in our day, as far as New York and the fashions were\r\nconcerned. As a matter of fact, it was so to a greater extent than was\r\nthen generally imagined. Dresses and hats which were labeled as made\r\nin Paris were, in reality, manufactured in New York. American skill\r\nand taste really were matchless, but the popular fad of that day was to\r\ndemand Paris-made articles and the enterprising shopkeeper filled that\r\ndemand by furnishing Paris goods--made in America.”\r\n\r\n“All that is changed now,” said the Colonel. “As Trixy says, to-day\r\nAmerican fashions concededly lead the world.”\r\n\r\nA servant entered, extending to the Colonel a silver salver upon which\r\nlay a letter.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me,” said the Colonel, as he broke the seal. “Ah! this is\r\nindeed news!” he exclaimed, as he rapidly read. “We are shortly to have\r\nwith us a most distinguished visitor.”\r\n\r\n“Who is it, papa?” inquired Beatrice with curiosity.\r\n\r\n“General Mainwarren,” answered the Colonel. “I must tell you about\r\nhim before he arrives,” he added, turning to his guests. “General\r\nMainwarren, who, by the way, is a distant cousin of ours, was a most\r\ndistinguished soldier during the war with Russia.”\r\n\r\n“What! Has the United States been at war with Russia?” exclaimed Kearns\r\nand the Professor in a breath.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered the Colonel, “that is one of the many events which\r\nI have not yet had an opportunity to tell to you. Our commercial\r\ninterests with Great Britain became so great, and the amount of our\r\nsurplus capital invested in British enterprises so large, that a\r\ndefensive alliance with that country grew to be a matter of necessity.\r\nWhen the integrity of the British Empire and incidentally the safety of\r\nour commercial interests came to be imperiled by the encroachments of\r\nthe great barbaric Power of the North, it was found necessary for the\r\nUnited States to step in and lend a helping hand. The war with Russia\r\nwas long and bloody and Napoleon’s famous invasion of the Russian\r\nEmpire was duplicated by the allied armies of the United States and\r\nGreat Britain. Great battles were fought; great victories were won\r\nand--needless to say--we eventually triumphed.”\r\n\r\n“How could it be otherwise! What can withstand the Anglo-Saxon race!”\r\nexclaimed the Professor proudly.\r\n\r\n“To think that all this should have been going on and I asleep!” cried\r\nKearns regretfully.\r\n\r\n“But I must hurry and tell you about General Mainwarren,” continued\r\nthe Colonel. “As I said before, he distinguished himself during this\r\nwar with Russia; became the pride of the people and the idol of his\r\nsoldiers. After the war, he fell into disfavor, owing to views which\r\nwere regarded as--as--disloyal. He was opposed to the general economic\r\nconditions--to the Trusts and the power wielded by them. This was\r\nstrange, inasmuch as his elder brother was the head of the great Ores\r\nand Minerals Trust, of which the Coal Trust was one of the subsidiary\r\norganizations. I never knew the precise rights of the matter, but the\r\nGeneral fell into disfavor and was retired from active service on half\r\npay. He was not honored with a title as had been officers of far less\r\ndistinguished service, but was studiously ignored in this respect by\r\nthe Sovereign. For a brief period he lived in comparative poverty and\r\nobscurity. His brother’s only son was fatally injured one day in an\r\naccident. The news was carried to the young man’s father. He was an old\r\nman and its suddenness overwhelmed him. He dropped where he stood and\r\nnever recovered consciousness. Everything he possessed had been left\r\nto his only son and this son survived the father by only a few hours,\r\ndying intestate. His uncle, the General, was the only relative and he\r\ninherited everything as the heir-at-law of the son. Thus, in one day,\r\nhe saw himself lifted into the position of one of the richest men in\r\nthe country.”\r\n\r\n“What a strange turn of fortune!” exclaimed the Professor.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered the Colonel; “but that is not all there is to tell.\r\nAfter he came into these immense properties, a change seemed to pass\r\nover him. Where before he had figured as the friend of the masses,\r\nhe now appeared as the direct reverse. In fact, various industrial\r\nmeasures adopted by him were of so grasping, uncompromising and\r\noffensive a character as to draw forth widespread condemnation. Even\r\nthe government protested. It regarded his line of action as calculated\r\nto foment public discontent and was, therefore, a menace. And so it\r\ncame about that where his championship of popular rights had before\r\ndrawn upon him the displeasure of the Throne, he was now in disfavor\r\nat Court for his radical course in precisely the opposite direction.\r\nCurious, is it not?”\r\n\r\n“That’s the way of mankind,” commented Kearns. “It was the same in our\r\nday. One kind of a man in adversity and a totally different kind of a\r\nman in prosperity. How often one sees that!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t care what they say of Cousin Mainwarren,” interposed Beatrice\r\nwarmly. “I believe he has a kind heart. But to come back to our\r\nsubject,” she added, addressing Kearns, “is it true that the ladies at\r\nthat time----”\r\n\r\nHer question was interrupted by the entrance of a servant, who\r\nannounced the arrival of General Mainwarren. The Colonel hurried out to\r\nreceive him.\r\n\r\nA few moments later he returned, accompanied by a man of most striking\r\npersonality. He was tall beyond the usual height, broad shouldered and\r\nmassive, with a large, strong face, every line and contour of which was\r\nindicative of resolution and power.\r\n\r\nThe new-comer greeted Beatrice with cheery courtesy and the Colonel\r\npresented General Mainwarren to his guests.\r\n\r\n“I need not disguise from you, gentlemen,” said the General, “that I\r\nknow of the experiences through which you’ve passed. The wildest rumors\r\non the subject are current in Pemberton and the newspapers are full of\r\nthem. However, I trust you won’t allow this to distress you. May I ask\r\nhow you like the new condition of things?” The General turned a keen\r\nand searching glance upon them as he put the question.\r\n\r\n“Well,” laughed the Professor, “it used to be the custom with the\r\nreporters of our day, when foreigners landed upon our shores, to\r\ninquire how they liked the country. As the visitor’s actual experience\r\nconsisted of a five minutes’ sojourn on the dock, the question was\r\nnaturally difficult to answer. It seems to me we are much in the same\r\nposition.”\r\n\r\n“So you are,” answered the General, smiling. “I may say to you,\r\nhowever, that you will find things much changed--much improved in some\r\nrespects, you will, perhaps, decide.”\r\n\r\n“How do you happen to be traveling this way?” asked Beatrice, with a\r\nwoman’s curiosity.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said the General, with a light laugh, “there’s a story connected\r\nwith that. I’ve been favored with a special summons to attend at\r\nCourt--to be received in special audience by His Majesty and the\r\nChancellor.”\r\n\r\nThe Colonel looked up sharply and turned a quick, inquiring glance upon\r\nthe speaker.\r\n\r\n“There--is--no--new--trouble?” he faltered.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” said the General lightly. “It is usually a sign of\r\nfavor for a subject to be summoned to attend the Court of the King. In\r\nmy case perhaps----”\r\n\r\nHe stopped abruptly and glanced toward Beatrice.\r\n\r\nThe young lady rose quickly from the table.\r\n\r\n“I know you want to discuss business and politics and horrid things\r\nof that kind,” she exclaimed petulantly, “so I’ll disappear. But you\r\nand I,” she continued, turning to the General, “will have a little\r\n_tête-à-tête_ before you leave, won’t we? If you are going to Court,\r\nyou can take a message to Dorothy.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” smilingly answered the General, and Beatrice tripped from\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n“I think we might take a turn in the garden,” remarked the Professor to\r\nKearns.\r\n\r\n“No, no; please don’t go,” exclaimed the General. “I’ll be indebted if\r\nyou will remain. I would like to have your opinion on certain matters.”\r\n\r\n“You are sure?” said the Professor hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n“Quite, quite sure,” declared the General. “Pray be seated.”\r\n\r\nThe Professor sank back into his seat.\r\n\r\n“There’s some trouble, I feel convinced,” said the Colonel with an air\r\nof concern.\r\n\r\n“Well,” answered General Mainwarren, “I’ll relieve you of any\r\nsuspense. I’ve been summoned to Court to confer with the Emperor and\r\nhis Chancellor regarding certain operations contemplated by the Coal\r\nTrust, of which,” he added with an explanatory wave of the hand to the\r\nProfessor and Kearns, “I am the head.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” interjected the Colonel; “but what’s the nature of these\r\nnew operations?”\r\n\r\n“Simply this,” replied the General carelessly; “it has been decided, to\r\ndescribe the plan briefly, to withhold the output of coal and to force\r\nup the price during the coming winter to fifteen crowns the ton.”\r\n\r\n“No, no; surely not!” cried the Colonel.\r\n\r\n“It has been decided and will be done,” said General Mainwarren\r\nfirmly. “The Sovereign, the Chancellor and the Imperial Council are\r\nmuch exercised, I understand, in view of the effect it is likely to\r\nhave upon the masses. Hence my summons to Court! And,” continued the\r\nGeneral, turning to the Professor, “what do you say to this plan? You\r\nhad certain experiences of this kind in your day, did you not?”\r\n\r\n“I must decline to express an opinion,” answered the Professor coldly.\r\n“I’m not sufficiently familiar with existing conditions to express an\r\nopinion. How am I to know what will be the effect upon the people at\r\nlarge?”\r\n\r\n“It will result in widespread suffering and distress; in misery of the\r\nmost dreadful kind,” said the Colonel, sadly.\r\n\r\n“Say, if you like,” replied General Mainwarren with brutal directness,\r\n“that it will result in widespread desolation and death. You may speak\r\nout. I’m not thin-skinned and don’t mind hearing the truth. Many\r\nfactories must close and tens of thousands will be thrown out of work;\r\nto say nothing of the misery and death which will ensue from actual\r\ncold. Hence the Court is exercised; hence it sends for me, but--it will\r\nbe in vain!”\r\n\r\n“And you,” said the Professor, turning horror-stricken eyes upon the\r\nspeaker, “realizing all these things, will still persist in your\r\ncourse!”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely and unalterably,” answered the General sternly. “I’ve\r\nbeen sent for to present myself at Court. I’ll be wheedled, pleaded\r\nwith, threatened and cajoled, but--it will be for naught. Ah, you seem\r\nastonished. What, then, is the view you take?”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said the Professor, rising, his eyes flashing in indignation and\r\nanger, “you have twice asked my opinion and I’ll give it, fully and\r\nfreely, as man to man. I consider that any man who will heartlessly\r\nthrow tens of thousands of working men out of employment; who will\r\nexpose tens of thousands to misery and want; who will let women and\r\nchildren languish and die from privation and cold, is a monster in\r\nhuman form--a fiend incarnate! His fellow men should turn from him in\r\nhorror and in loathing; his mother reproach herself that she gave him\r\nbirth. That’s my opinion, sir. God created these coal lands for the\r\nbenefit of humanity in general. It is preposterous to suppose that He\r\ncreated them for the exclusive benefit of any one man, or set of men.\r\nThe government that permits such action as you wish to take is unworthy\r\nto stand; it should be swept out of existence!”\r\n\r\n“My dear Professor!” interjected Kearns, endeavoring to allay his\r\ncompanion’s warmth; “are you not a little too vehement?”\r\n\r\n“You will pardon me,” said the Professor, turning to Colonel Cuming,\r\n“but I can’t retract, or even modify, my words. I thank you for your\r\nkindly hospitality, which I have but ill-repaid. I’ll now withdraw from\r\nyour presence and your house.”\r\n\r\nGeneral Mainwarren had listened with flushed face and contracted brows.\r\n\r\n“No, no,” he interposed hastily, “no apology is either necessary or\r\nproper. I asked your opinion; you’ve given it. An honest opinion is\r\nalways deserving of respect; the more frank and outspoken, the better\r\nit is. That which I take exception to is not the words themselves, but\r\nat such words from you--YOU!”\r\n\r\n“From me!” exclaimed the Professor. “And why particularly from me?”\r\n\r\n“From you, sir,” continued the General, with fiery emphasis, “or from\r\nany man of your day. Isn’t it to the men of your day that we owe the\r\nexamples we follow? If I mistake not it was precisely the men of your\r\ntime who first taught to this land the lesson of the concentration of\r\ncapital; wasn’t it your capitalists who first promulgated the theory\r\nof their divine appointment to the control of the good things of this\r\nworld?”\r\n\r\n“That theory was the theory of the Few; not of the Many,” objected the\r\nProfessor.\r\n\r\n“It was certainly tolerated and permitted by the people of your time,”\r\nretorted General Mainwarren, “and in pursuing my course I’m only\r\nfollowing out that which has been a sanctioned time-honored custom. If\r\nthe people objected to these things, the proper time to have stopped\r\nthem was when they first began. I forgive your words, Professor Dean; I\r\nbear no rancor. But such words coming from a man of your era is, upon\r\nmy honor, like the pot calling the kettle black!”\r\n\r\nThe Professor was about to reply, but his answer was cut short by the\r\nentry of a servant, bringing a card to Colonel Cuming. The Colonel took\r\nthe card from the salver, glanced at it and gave a direction to the\r\nservant, who immediately retired.\r\n\r\nRising and holding between his fingers the card which had been brought\r\nto him, he faced the others:\r\n\r\n“A messenger from His Majesty, the King,” he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nMR. KEARNS HAS A PREMONITION\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some moments after the Colonel had left the room the three men sat\r\nin silence. Then General Mainwarren turned to the Professor.\r\n\r\n“You will forgive me if my words have been too blunt,” he said\r\ncourteously; “but students of sociology agree that the conditions of\r\nthe present epoch had their origin in your day; that such origin can\r\nbe distinctly traced back; and that with the men of your time lies the\r\nresponsibility for whatever exists to-day.”\r\n\r\n“And you, I trust, will pardon any undue warmth on my side,” replied\r\nthe Professor, “but this I must say; however much you may be disposed\r\nto blame the people of my day, you, personally, if you will permit me\r\nto say so, seem disposed to carry out measures far more arbitrary and\r\ndrastic than were ever adopted in our time.”\r\n\r\n“You refer to the measures I spoke of in relation to the coal supply?”\r\nasked General Mainwarren.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Certainly you don’t claim that God, or Nature--call it what you\r\nwill--placed those deposits exclusively for your benefit and that you\r\ncan deal with them absolutely as you will, regardless of the rights,\r\ninterests or welfare of humanity in general?”\r\n\r\n“It was ill-advised,” retorted the General, slowly and with emphasis,\r\n“for you to raise that point. If you will remember, it was in your\r\ntime that that very point was first set up.”\r\n\r\n“I fail to recall----”\r\n\r\n“Surely not! Wasn’t it in your day that the claim was for the first\r\ntime advanced that these very coal deposits were vested in certain\r\nhands by divine appointment and that the right to manage such\r\nproperties must be left solely and entirely to the discretion of those\r\nwhom the Almighty had so selected? Wasn’t this question of divine right\r\nadvanced, for the first time in the history of the Republic, in your\r\nday and--successfully maintained?”\r\n\r\n“How successfully maintained?”\r\n\r\n“Can you even question! I have studied carefully the history of the\r\ntime and I at least know my facts. Wasn’t the situation then critical\r\nenough? The operators withheld the output. The people were perishing\r\nfrom cold. Death stalked abroad. Had not the State Government ample\r\npower to declare that the public health and safety required the seizure\r\nof those lands, with compensation, of course, to the owners? This\r\nsovereignty right of eminent domain was invoked when it was a question\r\nof putting through a new street, or creating a right of way for some\r\nquasi-public corporation. But when it came to exercising the right\r\nagainst a powerful corporation, it seems your suffering people feared\r\nto even whisperingly advocate the measure. So,” continued the General,\r\n“the people were permitted to languish and die and the theory of divine\r\nright took its birth and, as you perceive, has flourished apace since\r\nthen.”\r\n\r\n“By George! there’s a good deal of truth in what you say!” exclaimed\r\nKearns.\r\n\r\n“When did these events occur to which you have referred?” questioned\r\nthe Professor.\r\n\r\n“Early in the present century,” replied the General.\r\n\r\n“We must distinctly disclaim responsibility for anything occurring\r\nafter June the tenth, nineteen hundred,” declared the Professor, with a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n“True, I had forgotten that!” replied General Mainwarren with a laugh.\r\n\r\n“But what I don’t understand,” said the Professor, again grown serious,\r\n“is that you, who seem to so thoroughly grasp and understand these\r\nevils, should be willing to actively engage in their perpetuation.”\r\n\r\nBefore General Mainwarren could reply to this home-thrust, the door\r\nopened and Colonel Cuming reappeared.\r\n\r\n“Can you imagine,” he exclaimed with evident excitement, “the errand of\r\nthe royal messenger?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, to hurry Somebody on his journey, of course--before we’ve had half\r\na chance of enjoying his society,” pouted Beatrice, who had followed\r\nthe Colonel into the room. “A summons to Court----”\r\n\r\n“A summons to Court--that part is right,” interrupted the Colonel,\r\n“but you haven’t guessed rightly as to whom. The message is this: ‘His\r\nMajesty commands Colonel Sir Maynard Cuming to repair at once to Court\r\nand to bring with him his notable guests, Professor Walter Stuart\r\nDean and Mr. Thomas Kearns, the details concerning whose remarkable\r\nexperiences His Majesty has learned with much interest.’ What do you\r\nsay to that?”\r\n\r\nBoth the Professor and Kearns stood agape with astonishment. Beatrice’s\r\nvoice was the first to break the silence.\r\n\r\n“And do I go, too, papa?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, my dear--if you wish.”\r\n\r\n“If I wish! Well, yes; I decidedly do. Just think of the fun of going\r\nto Court and seeing cousin Dorothy. My cousin, Dorothy,” she added,\r\nas an explanatory interjection for the benefit of the Professor and\r\nKearns, “is one of the maids of honor to the Queen.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” added General Mainwarren, “and she is as popular at the Court as\r\nshe is beautiful, which in this case is saying much.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, my dear,” exclaimed the Colonel wistfully, “you haven’t seen\r\nDorothy since you were quite a little girl. I fear you may find things\r\nsomewhat changed. Dorothy may not be inclined to devote so much\r\nattention to my little country bud as in the old days.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Beatrice with enthusiasm, “I am convinced Dorothy will never\r\nchange toward me. She’s not that kind. When do we start?”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow! Oh, how shall I ever be able to get ready! I must be off to\r\nlook after things. I hope I shan’t appear before the Court and Dorothy\r\nquite like a dowdy!” And she pirouetted out of the room.\r\n\r\n“Forgive her, gentlemen,” said the Colonel indulgently, “she’s only a\r\nchild yet, you know. But, tell me what you think of this news I bring.”\r\n\r\n“Think!” replied the Professor; “what are we to think. It’s impossible\r\nto imagine what we can be needed for--except, perhaps, as curiosities.\r\nI’m quite unfamiliar with the atmosphere of a Court and I think I\r\nmay truthfully say that my friend Kearns is equally so. I don’t know\r\nwhether we should go.”\r\n\r\n“And I think I may truthfully say,” declared Kearns, with a laugh,\r\n“that I have had an extensive experience with courts, though not of\r\nthis precise character. Still, like the Professor, I am in doubt as to\r\nwhether we ought to go. I’ve no particular liking for figuring as a\r\ncuriosity.”\r\n\r\n“It would never do to refuse the royal command,” said the Colonel. “Oh,\r\nby the way, there is something I had nearly forgotten. His Majesty has\r\nespecially inquired as to the health of Mr. Kearns and will receive him\r\nin special audience immediately after his arrival at the Court.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” exclaimed the Professor with light sarcasm, “let me\r\ncongratulate you, my friend. You seem to be basking in the sunshine of\r\nroyal favor.”\r\n\r\nBut Kearns sat with bent brows, apparently in deep thought. A moment\r\nlater he sprang lightly to his feet.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he exclaimed with determination, “we’ll go. I’ve been there\r\nbefore, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Where?” asked the Professor. “To the Court?”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered Kearns grimly, “not to the Court, but I’ve had\r\nexperiences of this kind before. In the old days there were lots of\r\ntimes when the rich and the grand solicitously inquired as to the\r\nhealth of Mr. Thomas Kearns and were graciously pleased--it used to be\r\n‘exceedingly pleased’ or ‘eagerly anxious’ in those days--to receive\r\nhim in special audience. My experience tells me that when the rich and\r\nthe great and the mighty are suddenly seized with a vivid interest\r\nin my health, joined to an anxiety to see me in special audience, it\r\nis safe to gamble there are special reasons therefor. In the classic\r\nlanguage of my day: ‘There is something doing’--some cash, or jewels,\r\nor maybe a lady gone astray and Thomas Kearns is needed to fix the\r\ndifficulty, or solve the puzzle.”\r\n\r\n“You think,” said the Professor, “that----”\r\n\r\n“That there is some trouble at Court, or some danger which threatens\r\nthe King upon his throne,” said Kearns with conviction.\r\n\r\n“I shall not be astonished if you were right,” said General Mainwarren\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the day was spent in preparations for the departure. Not\r\nleast amongst these preparations was the selection for the Professor\r\nand Kearns, of a wardrobe which would modernize them in dress, at\r\nleast. Some further instruction as to the changes which had taken place\r\nand as to the methods and manners of the Court were also given, with\r\nGeneral Mainwarren and the Colonel as instructors. Interspersed with\r\nmatters of Court etiquette, they learned the details of the great war\r\nrecently so successfully closed between Russia and the Allies--the\r\nUnited States and Great Britain--in which, after many fierce struggles\r\nand an invasion resembling in many details that of the great Napoleon,\r\nthe power of the fierce, barbaric Colossus of the North had finally\r\nbeen crushed.\r\n\r\nAt dinner that evening, Beatrice, full of life and spirits, was in\r\njoyous anticipation of the journey before them. Her prattle kept the\r\nparty in merry mood, all except General Mainwarren, who seemed somewhat\r\nthoughtful and preoccupied.\r\n\r\n“We will enjoy our coffee and cigars in the music room,” said the\r\nColonel to the Professor and Kearns, when dinner was over. “You shall\r\nindulge in a treat that was unattainable in your times.”\r\n\r\nHe led the way to a spacious apartment adjoining the library--an\r\napartment from walls of which protruded a number of giant-like trumpets.\r\n\r\n“There,” said the Colonel, pointing to two of the larger instruments,\r\n“we have direct connection with the Haymarket Theatre, in London,\r\nand also with the Covent Garden Theatre. Those other two instruments\r\nconnect with two opera houses in Paris. I cannot treat you to English,\r\nor to French opera. Owing to the difference in time, neither of these\r\ncities is in action at its theatres at this moment. I can, however,\r\nlet you hear some of the leading attractions in New York.”\r\n\r\n“Yon mean to say,” exclaimed the Professor with rapt interest, “that\r\nyou are practically in telephonic communication with the principal\r\ncities of the world?”\r\n\r\n“Hardly that,” answered the Colonel modestly, “since my music room is\r\nnot large enough to permit of it, but it could be done. As it is, I am\r\nin touch with London, Paris, and several of the principal cities in\r\nthis country. Now, listen to this. I am going to connect with the Folly\r\nTheatre, in New York. They have a revival on there of an old operetta;\r\nquite a favorite, I believe, in your time.”\r\n\r\n“What is its name?” asked Kearns.\r\n\r\n“Dolly Varden,” replied the Colonel effusively; “Dolly Varden, the\r\ntitle rôle of which, if I recall aright, was created by that charming\r\n_artiste_ of your day, Glaser--the glorious Glaser, whose name has come\r\ndown to us as the queen of comedy of the Western world.”\r\n\r\nAs the Colonel finished speaking, he turned a rubber-covered knob in\r\nthe wall beside one of the instruments and instantly there floated\r\nthrough the room the strains of “The Lay of the Jay,” from Edwards’\r\ncaptivating operetta. Sweetly and clearly music and words floated into\r\nthe room:\r\n\r\n  “Once there was a jay-bird; a rather ancient jay-bird,\r\n        Who lived on the top of a tree.”\r\n\r\nAs the song ended, Kearns and the Professor were visibly affected.\r\n\r\nThe minutes passed. Still they listened, entranced, until the close of\r\nthe opera. Then came the sounds of a moving multitude, joined to the\r\nplaying of the band.\r\n\r\n“The audience is leaving,” remarked the Professor regretfully, “and\r\nthe orchestra is playing the air ‘My Country ’Tis of Thee.’ Thank God!\r\nYou have, at least, retained that old, familiar song.”\r\n\r\n“You mistake!” said General Mainwarren solemnly. “It is no longer known\r\nby that name.”\r\n\r\n“What, then?” gasped the Professor.\r\n\r\n“God Save our Gracious King!” said the General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nA MYSTERY OF THE PALACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe antechamber of the King, in the great Summer Palace on the hill,\r\nwas crowded with officers of the Army and Navy, financiers and\r\nstatesmen, diplomats and courtiers. The officers and the diplomats wore\r\nthe uniforms of their respective services. The rest were clad in court\r\ncostume, consisting of knee-breeches and tunic, strongly suggesting\r\nthe court dress of the times of Louis XVI. It is said that fashions,\r\nlike history, repeat themselves and here was a reversion to the models\r\nof the gay French court in the days of the Bourbons. With the splendor\r\nof color and the glittering crosses and orders upon the breasts of the\r\nmen, the scene was a brilliant one.\r\n\r\nA gorgeously attired attendant stood at the door leading into the\r\ninner audience chamber. At intervals someone who had been received in\r\naudience would pass out and the attendant, in a loud voice, would call\r\na name and the favored one would pass to the audience chamber.\r\n\r\n“General Mainwarren!” called the attendant, presently, and the General,\r\nleaving the side of Colonel Cuming, advanced and passed in.\r\n\r\nThe audience accorded the General was not prolonged. In a short time he\r\nreturned to the antechamber. There was a slight flush upon his face and\r\nhis mouth was set in a determined line.\r\n\r\n“How did matters pass off?” inquired the Colonel anxiously.\r\n\r\n“Nothing decisive,” replied General Mainwarren. “I am commanded to\r\nremain at Court pending further discussion. I had, though, a rather\r\nsharp passage of arms with Milord Ashley.”\r\n\r\n“Colonel Sir Maynard Cuming and party!” the attendant at that moment\r\nannounced; and the Colonel, followed by the Professor and Kearns,\r\nentered the audience chamber.\r\n\r\nThe King was seated in a massive chair of magnificently carved oak,\r\nbeside a portentous-looking table, littered with documents of state and\r\nother papers tied together with pink or blue silk ribbon. As he sat\r\nthere, he presented the appearance of a man slightly above the middle\r\nheight, slight of figure and thin of face, with keen, bright blue\r\neyes, a long and luxuriant brown moustache and short, closely clipped,\r\nlighter-brown beard. The face, deeply marked with lines of thought and\r\ncare, showed keen perception and sharp intuition. His movements were\r\nquick and nervous. There was one noticeable mannerism. The face had\r\na peculiar aptitude for breaking into a smile which at its moment of\r\norigin was bright and cheery and, so lasting for a moment, suddenly\r\ndied away into a fixed, cold stare. It was as a gleam of sunshine,\r\nfollowed by frost. He was garbed in the dress of the Court and upon his\r\nbreast glittered a single order.\r\n\r\nBeside and slightly behind him stood Lord Cyril Ashley, Vice-Chancellor\r\nof the Empire and Master of the Imperial Household. Lord Ashley was\r\na well-preserved man of middle age; tall, handsome, and of soldierly\r\nbearing. The face, with its dark eyes, strongly marked brows and\r\nsweeping black moustache, was that of a man of stern will and strong\r\ndetermination. He was dressed in the dashing uniform of a Captain of\r\nthe Guards.\r\n\r\nColonel Cuming advanced, bowing low before the King, followed by his\r\ntwo companions. The Colonel was received by His Majesty with marked\r\ncordiality and at the royal invitation he presented the Professor and\r\nKearns. As the latter was presented, the King turned upon him a sharp,\r\nscrutinizing glance.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty listened to the story of the resurrection of the two\r\nwayfarers from the past with an air of marked interest and after asking\r\na number of questions signified that the interview was at an end. But\r\nit was the royal wish that Mr. Thomas Kearns should remain in special\r\naudience.\r\n\r\nColonel Cuming and the Professor accordingly backed out of the royal\r\npresence, leaving Kearns somewhat astonished and perplexed amid his\r\nnovel surroundings.\r\n\r\n“History records, Mr. Kearns,” said the King, “that you were the most\r\nskilful and the most successful Chief of Secret Service this country\r\nhas ever known. Is not that correct, Milord?” he asked, turning to Lord\r\nAshley.\r\n\r\n“It is so recorded, Sire,” answered the Vice-Chancellor. “Our\r\nhistorians and our writers of fiction have alike presented to us Mr.\r\nKearns as the great Chief of Secret Service of the Western world--the\r\nequal of Vidocq, or of Fouché, if not their superior.”\r\n\r\n“Just so,” said the King; “and it is precisely a Fouché that we need\r\nat our court at the present time. Your old-time cunning is, doubtless,\r\nstill with you?”\r\n\r\nKearns bowed somewhat awkwardly.\r\n\r\n“I do not know, Sire,” he answered simply.\r\n\r\nHe had heard both Colonel Cuming and Lord Ashley address the King as\r\n“Sire,” and he thought it best to follow this form.\r\n\r\n“How so--you do not know?” inquired the King.\r\n\r\n“Well, Sire,” replied Kearns, “as such talents as I once had have not\r\nhad a chance of being exercised during seventy-five years, they may\r\nhave become somewhat rusty. Besides, your writers have, perhaps, taken\r\nliberties and have exaggerated somewhat.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” exclaimed the King, his face breaking into a pleasant smile; “the\r\nmodesty of genius!” The smile faded suddenly into that peculiar frosty\r\nstare, and he continued: “We have, however, less need for modesty than\r\nfor action. Do you feel your abilities impaired?”\r\n\r\n“Not in the least, Sire,” came the quick answer. “I feel as well as\r\never I did in my life.”\r\n\r\n“Why, then,” retorted the King, “should you question your ability? Is\r\nit not true that upon one occasion you detected the writer of certain\r\nletters from among a whole cityful of people?”\r\n\r\n“I had so many cases in my time, Sire,” answered Kearns, with some\r\nhesitancy, “that I scarcely recollect the particular case you seem to\r\nhave in mind. My memory has grown a little faint after this lapse of\r\ntime. If you could give me a few details as to the circumstances----”\r\n\r\n“The circumstances,” exclaimed the King, “were, as we remember them, as\r\nfollows: An ancestor of one of our most distinguished subjects--Baron\r\nGold--had been the recipient of a number of letters, written by some\r\nunknown writer, threatening him with assassination. He sent to you for\r\naid in his peril and, it is recorded, within forty-eight hours, by a\r\nmost ingenious plan, you had detected and apprehended the malefactor.\r\nIs this true?”\r\n\r\nKearns with difficulty restrained himself from laughing outright. Well\r\nhe remembered the case now and the shrewd face of the ancestor of the\r\ndistinguished Baron Gold rose with startling vividness before his\r\nmental vision.\r\n\r\n“Quite true, Sire,” he answered gravely; “but the case was a rather\r\nsimple one.”\r\n\r\n“A rather simple one! We would have you tell us how you accomplished\r\nthese things.”\r\n\r\n“In this way, Sire,” replied Kearns. “As you have said, our\r\nfriend--that is, I should say, the--ah--distinguished ancestor of the\r\ndistinguished Baron Gold had been in receipt of letters threatening him\r\nwith death, unless he paid a certain money tribute. He was a man of\r\nwealth--of very great wealth--but he had a constitutional aversion to\r\nparting with it. Almost equally he disliked the possibility of sudden\r\ndeath.”\r\n\r\nAgain the King smiled his peculiar smile of mingled sunshine and frost.\r\n\r\n“How the characteristics of the ancestor are carried down through the\r\ngenerations!” he remarked to Lord Ashley.\r\n\r\nThe latter smiled and bowed a respectful acquiescence.\r\n\r\n“Proceed!” said the King.\r\n\r\n“Brought face to face with these two almost equally disagreeable\r\nalternatives,” continued Kearns, “he sent for me. Investigation quickly\r\nshowed me that all the letters had been mailed within a certain radius\r\nin the city. I caused such action to be taken by the ancestor of Baron\r\nGold as was likely to lead to an early reply from the unknown letter\r\nwriter. Then I proceeded to throw out my net. I caused every drop box\r\nin the post offices and every pillar box in the streets within the\r\nsuspected district to be watched by two persons--the one an employe\r\nof the Post Office, the other one of my men. The moment a letter was\r\ndropped, the Post Office employe would proceed to examine the address\r\non such letter. If it was not addressed to the threatened person, a\r\nrubber band was twisted over the envelope to distinguish it from\r\nanything dropped later. In this way the Post Office man was readily\r\nenabled to distinguish all the examined letters from the latest one\r\ndropped.\r\n\r\n“This method,” pursued Kearns, “was continued systematically for a day\r\nand a night without yielding any result. On the afternoon of the second\r\nday, however, a man approached a letter box in one of the side streets,\r\ndeposited a letter and hastily walked away. The Post Office employe\r\nstepped to the box, opened it as usual and--up went his hand above his\r\nhead. This was the agreed signal. In an instant my man was after the\r\ndepositor of the letter and had him in custody. He was brought before\r\nme and the letter, opened in his presence by--ah--the ancestor of Baron\r\nGold, contained conclusive proof of his guilt. The man turned out to be\r\na monomaniac, hence his peculiar cunning and the difficulty experienced\r\nin catching him in any of the ordinary traps usually laid in such\r\ncases. But, you see, after all, the case was simple enough.”\r\n\r\n“It was highly ingenious,” decided the King. “It is recorded also that\r\nout of a band of men you picked a murderer by an examination of the\r\nhands of these men. Is this so?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Sire,” answered Kearns; “that’s quite correct. The case was a\r\nmore difficult one. The circumstances were somewhat repellant.”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, we would learn them,” said the King.\r\n\r\n“A woman had been murdered by one of that species of fiends, half\r\ncriminal, half madman, who spring up from time to time. The murderer\r\nin this case, after killing his victim, had torn away certain portions\r\nof the body. In the course of his devilish work, he had cut into and\r\nmutilated a portion of the intestines. My investigations discovered\r\nthat a short time before the murder the woman had eaten a certain kind\r\nof food. From other circumstances learned by me I was convinced that\r\none of a certain number of men had slain her. I had these men brought\r\nbefore me and caused the lodgments under their finger-nails to be\r\ncarefully scraped and preserved in separate packages. A scientific\r\nexamination of the contents of one package disclosed the presence of\r\nhuman blood corpuscles, together with certain minute particles, the\r\nchemical resultants of that particular food of which the woman had\r\npartaken shortly before her death. In a word, I had the murderer.”\r\n\r\n“Skilful, decidedly skilful,” commented the King. “It is precisely for\r\nsuch skill that we have urgent need at the present time.”\r\n\r\n“In what direction, Sire?”\r\n\r\n“Here--at our Court. We have decided to retain you in our service and\r\nwe count upon your fidelity and the exercise of your uttermost skill.”\r\n\r\nKearns bowed. The ancestor of the distinguished Baron Gold and the\r\nnumerous other great men who had been wont to invoke his services\r\nin the olden time had adopted a tone of supplication rather than of\r\npatronage. However, he accepted the change as part and parcel of the\r\nnew order of things and Mr. Thomas Kearns was a man to adapt himself to\r\nany and all existing circumstances.\r\n\r\n“Listen, then,” said the King. “For some time past our peace has been\r\ndisturbed--nay, the safety of our very person threatened--from some\r\nunknown source which all the energy of our Secret Service has been\r\nunable to discover. We look to you to discover that source--to run to\r\nearth these arch-enemies of our peace and safety.”\r\n\r\n“Will you furnish me with further details, Sire?”\r\n\r\n“It was some months ago,” continued the King, “when we awoke one\r\nmorning to find a paper on the table beside our bed. It is needless\r\nto recount what this paper contained. Suffice that it held demands\r\nand threats. You will realize the importance of this happening, for\r\nhe who had the power to deposit that paper had also the power to have\r\ninflicted more material injury.”\r\n\r\nKearns bowed his assent.\r\n\r\n“Our sleeping apartment,” resumed the King, “is some fifty feet from\r\nthe ground. There are sentinels on the roof of the palace and in the\r\ngrounds below. The sentinels were trebled and other precautions taken\r\nand yet again this occurrence came to pass.”\r\n\r\n“Another document,” questioned Kearns, “of the same character,\r\ndeposited under the same circumstances?”\r\n\r\n“Precisely,” said the King, and a perceptible shiver passed over him;\r\n“but yet stranger things were to happen. Extraordinary precautions were\r\nnow taken. The surroundings of the room were filled with sentinels,\r\nmen were posted in the corridors, an officer of the guard stationed\r\nin the antechamber. At our side slept our faithful mastiff, Victor--a\r\nnoble brute, of great sagacity and strength. The doors leading into\r\nour apartment were sealed from the inside by our own hand, so that no\r\nmovement of these doors could be made without disturbing these seals.\r\nWere these not precautions enough?”\r\n\r\n“The value of a precaution is best tested by its efficacy, Sire,”\r\nreplied Kearns cautiously.\r\n\r\n“Then,” exclaimed the King, “these precautions were without value, for\r\none night, some four weeks ago, there was another visitation.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, Sire?”\r\n\r\n“Our repose had lasted some two hours when we were sharply awakened\r\nby the furious barking of the dog, followed by his savage growls. His\r\nhead was bent to the ground and he savagely clutched something between\r\nhis teeth. Nothing in the apartment was disturbed; nothing beyond the\r\nactions of the animal was to be noted; the seals on the doors were\r\nundisturbed. And yet--between the teeth of the dog was a document,\r\nfolded and tied together. It contained the same demands, repeated the\r\nsame threats. With an apartment fifty feet above the ground, armed\r\nsentinels filling every avenue, the doors fastened by seals, how did it\r\nget there--how did it get there!” cried the King with agitation.\r\n\r\n“The possibility of a trap door in floor or ceiling, or of a secret\r\nentrance of any kind to the chamber is not to be entertained, of\r\ncourse?” asked Kearns.\r\n\r\n“Not for a moment!” exclaimed the King. “You may pass that by as not\r\nneeding further consideration. Eh, Milord Ashley?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, undoubtedly!” answered the Master of the Household. “The apartment\r\nhas been thoroughly examined from every side. Any secret means of\r\ningress through floor, walls or ceiling is absolutely impossible.”\r\n\r\n“But there are chimneys--windows?”\r\n\r\n“Chimneys, no,” replied Lord Ashley. “We warm to-day by electricity and\r\nthere isn’t a chimney in the whole palace. As to windows, yes; there\r\nare four.”\r\n\r\n“Were they shuttered, or screened?”\r\n\r\n“Screened?” exclaimed Lord Ashley with bewilderment. “How do you\r\nmean--screened?”\r\n\r\n“Why,” answered Kearns, equally astonished at this observation, “I\r\nmean, of course, screened against flies--mosquitoes.”\r\n\r\n“Flies--mosquitoes!” exclaimed the King and Lord Ashley in the same\r\nbreath. Both gave a hearty guffaw.\r\n\r\nKearns was visibly nettled. This was, indeed, different from the old\r\ndays. He was certainly not accustomed to being laughed at. The last\r\ntime this had occurred was when he had been outwitted upon one occasion\r\nby Converse, the so-called King of Counterfeiters--an experienced,\r\nclever and wily old wrongdoer. Kearns never forgave that laugh, and\r\nit was not long until Converse, in spite of his great ability, fell\r\ninto an especially clever net set by Kearns. Incidentally, he paid\r\nthe penalty of that laugh with a twenty years’ sentence. It was not a\r\nhealthy occupation to laugh at Mr. Kearns in those days.\r\n\r\nLord Ashley noticed Kearns’ very evident chagrin.\r\n\r\n“No, no,” he hastened to explain; “thanks to our modern scientists we\r\nhave no flies or--ah--mosquitoes in these days. They are unknown to-day\r\nexcept as curiosities in the collection of some scientist, or under\r\nthe glass cases in our museums. It is quite natural,” he added, with a\r\nconciliatory wave of the hand, “that you should have--ah--overlooked\r\nthis fact.”\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Kearns’ chagrin was not to be so easily dissipated.\r\n\r\n“Conditions have doubtless changed,” he said somewhat testily, “and I\r\nsee nothing to be gained by any desultory examination of the facts.\r\nIt will be necessary for me to make a personal investigation of the\r\nsurroundings themselves.”\r\n\r\n“Every facility shall be accorded you,” said the King. “Quarters shall\r\nbe assigned you in the palace. Do you think,” he inquired anxiously,\r\n“that you will succeed?”\r\n\r\n“I’m not accustomed to failure, Sire,” answered Kearns almost curtly.\r\n\r\n“Succeed, then,” exclaimed the King, “and the reward which shall\r\nbe yours shall be such as to emphasize the distinction between the\r\nliberality of a Court and the proverbial ingratitude of Republics.”\r\n\r\nKearns bowed.\r\n\r\n“I can undertake to prosecute this investigation successfully,” he\r\nsaid, “under one condition only.”\r\n\r\n“It is?” asked the King.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been accustomed, Sire,” said Kearns with dignity, “to pursue\r\ncertain methods peculiarly my own. Those methods I must continue if I\r\nam to be successful. You’ve doubtless had people at work on this case.\r\nThey must be called off. In a word, I must not be interfered with. I\r\nmust have sole and entire charge.”\r\n\r\n“But suppose you should need assistance?”\r\n\r\n“Then I’ll ask for it. Also, I reserve the right to select my\r\nassistants.”\r\n\r\nBoth the King and Lord Ashley seemed to hesitate. At last the King\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n“Those so far employed have failed,” he said. “It shall be as you ask.”\r\n\r\n“Then, Sire,” said Kearns, “I’ve but one other request to make.”\r\n\r\n“Name it,” said the King.\r\n\r\n“That my companion, Professor Dean, be permitted to remain.”\r\n\r\n“A most natural desire,” exclaimed the King. “Our Master of the\r\nHousehold will issue such orders as will insure every facility to you\r\nand every comfort to you both. You will attend the Court ball to-night;\r\nit will afford you opportunities of observation.”\r\n\r\nHis Majesty signified that the audience was at an end and Mr. Kearns\r\nwithdrew.\r\n\r\n“Professor,” said Kearns, after they had been conducted to the quarters\r\nassigned them in the palace, “didn’t I predict that there were special\r\nreasons why we should be welcomed here? With our services in demand and\r\nwith the freedom of the Imperial Palace, we don’t seem to be doing so\r\nbadly for wayfarers in a strange land.”\r\n\r\n“That’s true,” said the Professor. “There is some danger, then,\r\nthreatening the King?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Serious?”\r\n\r\n“From what I can judge of the case thus far,” said Mr. Kearns\r\nthoughtfully, “I should say yes! Serious--_quite serious_!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT COURT BALL\r\n\r\n\r\n“I will point out some of the notables,” said General Mainwarren to the\r\nProfessor and Kearns; “they will no doubt interest you, especially such\r\nas are descendants of those known to you in your time.”\r\n\r\nThe scene was the great Court ball, held in the magnificent _salons_\r\nof the Summer Palace, ablaze with light and beauty. The sumptuous\r\ndecorations, the masses of flowers, the resplendent uniforms, the\r\nglittering crosses and orders upon the breasts of many of the men, the\r\nCourt dresses, the blaze of jewels--composed a scene of the utmost\r\nbrilliancy and splendor.\r\n\r\nAnd the women! American women have ever been famed for their grace,\r\ntheir ineffable _chic_ and their beauty, and certainly the race, as\r\nviewed from this ball-room floor, seemed by no means to have declined.\r\nKearns, who had been a regular attendant at the opera in the old days,\r\nconsidered himself quite a judge of feminine loveliness. He remembered\r\nto have heard it urged by captious foreigners that the American woman’s\r\nweakest points were her walk and her voice. These defects seemed to\r\nhave received attention, for in the noble bearing of the heads of these\r\nwomen, the graceful sweep of their walk, their sweet vocal intonations,\r\nthere was no ground left for the most captious critic to stand upon.\r\nDecidedly, thought Kearns, both the walk and the voice had been\r\ncultivated to perfection under the _regime_ of royalty.\r\n\r\n“The notables,” he said in answer to General Mainwarren’s words. “Ah,\r\nyes! By the way,” he added with sudden animation, “could you point out\r\nto me the--the--distinguished Baron Gold.”\r\n\r\n“Baron Gold--Baron Gold,” repeated General Mainwarren, “let me see if I\r\ncan discover him for you.”\r\n\r\nHe glanced about the ball-room.\r\n\r\n“There he is!” he exclaimed, after a brief search.\r\n\r\nKearns and the Professor followed the direction of the General’s glance\r\nand saw an old man, with gray eyes, sunken cheeks and high forehead,\r\nengaged in conversation with a white-moustached gentleman, in the\r\nuniform of the diplomatic corps, who sat at his side.\r\n\r\n“So that is Baron Gold?” said Kearns.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered General Mainwarren, “that is Baron Gold, one of the\r\ngreat Trust magnates and at one time Chancellor of the Exchequer.\r\nHis country seat is Gorgan Court and his arms are an eagle with beak\r\nelevated and talons outspread, and the motto: ‘I dare and I do.’ That’s\r\ncorrect, I believe, Colonel?”\r\n\r\n“Quite,” answered Colonel Cuming.\r\n\r\n“‘I dare and I do,’ eh?” said Kearns reflectively. “Very appropriate!”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” exclaimed General Mainwarren, “see the party passing opposite\r\nto us. He with the white hair, slightly in advance of the rest,\r\nwith the Star of the Empire upon his breast, is His Grace, the Duke\r\nof Marquanna, Chancellor of the Realm, often styled the American\r\n‘Warwick,’ since he lent such powerful hand in the establishment and\r\nformation of the Empire. He takes his title from his beautiful country\r\nseat, bearing the family name of Marquanna. His arms are a gerfalcon,\r\nrising over an argent field, with the motto: ‘Gold is tried by Fire,\r\nbut Men are tried by Gold.’”\r\n\r\n“An excellent motto, too!” commented Kearns. “‘Men are tried by gold!’\r\neh? Well; the handsome and able ancestor of this particular Duke could\r\ncertainly have left behind some striking illustrations of that fact had\r\nhe been pleased to do so.”\r\n\r\n“The Duke,” continued General Mainwarren, “is growing somewhat old and\r\ninfirm and, while he yields not one jot of his power and authority,\r\ncertain of the more arduous routine duties of his office of Chancellor\r\nhe delegates to the Vice-Chancellor, Lord Ashley, who is there on his\r\nleft hand. You are already acquainted with him.”\r\n\r\n“What manner of man is Lord Ashley?” questioned Kearns. “He interests\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“Lord Ashley, Vice-Chancellor and Master of the Imperial Household,”\r\nreplied General Mainwarren, “is a soldier who earned a reputation for\r\ndaring and dash during the early part of the late war with Russia. He\r\nwas severely wounded at the battle of Pedrofski and retired during\r\nthe rest of the campaign. His actual military rank is Captain of the\r\nImperial Guards--a position which carries with it the brevet rank of\r\nLieutenant-Colonel.”\r\n\r\n“Who are these Guards?” asked Kearns.\r\n\r\n“They are His Majesty’s body-guard, and consist of three regiments,”\r\nsaid the General. “They are attached to the different imperial palaces.\r\nThe men are all picked for their splendid physique, and the uniforms\r\nare magnificent.”\r\n\r\n“So I see,” assented Kearns, his eyes still following the Duke of\r\nMarquanna’s party. “And who are the four persons behind the Duke?”\r\n\r\n“The taller one of the first two,” answered General Mainwarren, “is\r\nthe Earl of Vandergilt, one of the heads of the great Transportation\r\nTrust, and the smaller, stouter man at his side, with the white side\r\nwhiskers, the rubicund countenance and nose like the beak of the eagle\r\nis Sir Mancey Carew, a great legal light, raconteur, and right-hand man\r\nof the Earl. See how his eyes twinkle and his lips purse; he is about\r\nto tell a story!”\r\n\r\n“And the other two?”\r\n\r\n“The nearest one to us,” answered General Mainwarren, “is Sir Keypoint\r\nHorgan; the person at his side I do not know. Do you, Colonel?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Colonel Cuming. “He’s a comparative new-comer at\r\nthe Court. He’s an Englishman, with important financial interests\r\nhere. Failing to attain distinction in his native land, it is said,\r\nhe decided to become a naturalized American subject. The King has\r\nrecently created him a Baronet and he now rejoices in the title of Sir\r\nWalder-Asta.”\r\n\r\n“There seem to be many notables present,” remarked Kearns.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied General Mainwarren. “The nobility from all parts of\r\nthe land are here. See the group over there to our right. There is\r\nSir Marlington Blackhouse, the famous cotillon leader, and Lady Terry\r\nMontbel and Lady Olive Harrifellow, each noted as a beauty and a\r\nsportswoman; Sir Hatmeadow-Hatmeadow Nailer, Lady Phillippe Shield and\r\nLady Dotter Dalmer, all three from the middle country; Sir Charles De\r\nOlde, from the West, and Lady Jacques Jardinier, from the city which, I\r\nbelieve, you were wont to term the ‘Athens of America.’”\r\n\r\nFurther conversation was temporarily interrupted by a stir, a buzz and\r\na general rising as the King and Queen, accompanied by their suites,\r\nmade their entrance and crossed the floor to a raised dais at the\r\nfurther end of the ball-room where two magnificently draped throne\r\nchairs were reserved for them. The band burst forth with the National\r\nAnthem, once known as “My Country, ’Tis of Thee,” now styled “God Save\r\nthe King.” The King and Queen took their seats and the ball was resumed.\r\n\r\nIn appearance the Queen was tall and slight of figure almost to the\r\npoint of girlishness, with pale, regular features and well-poised head.\r\nThe face reflected an amiable disposition, joined to a certain pride\r\nand determination, but it suggested more of sorrow and resignation\r\nthan of contentment and happiness. As she sat under the full light of\r\nthe brilliant ball-room, her regal jewels a-glitter, her noble profile\r\nsharply outlined, she looked graceful, beautiful, every inch a queen,\r\nyet unhappy.\r\n\r\nThe Professor and Kearns gazed upon her with mingled admiration and\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n“The Queen,” whispered the latter to General Mainwarren; “what of her?”\r\n\r\n“Is she not gracious and beautiful!” answered the General in lowered\r\ntones. “Who is she? She was, before her marriage to the King, an\r\nArchduchess of Austria--the youngest daughter of the Austrian monarch.”\r\n\r\n“She is popular and happy?”\r\n\r\n“Popular, yes--with her sweet and gracious ways she has crept into the\r\nhearts of the people and for that reason is regarded by many as one of\r\nthe strongest bulwarks of the throne. But happy; alas, no!”\r\n\r\n“And why not?”\r\n\r\n“Never did any mediæval monarch cling more strongly to the maxim that\r\n‘The King can do no wrong,’ or more fully demand the liberties and\r\nimmunities claimed by kingcraft, than this King who sits upon the\r\nAmerican throne. His profligacy and licentiousness, his all too many\r\nand too flagrant intrigues, have deeply shocked the Queen, who is\r\nnaturally possessed of strong religious and moral sentiments. There\r\nis an estrangement of long standing between them. They are together\r\nonly when some public function demands and she maintains a surrounding\r\nof her own, entirely apart from the King’s, devoting her attention\r\nlargely to the education of the two young princes. Ah, there is little\r\nBeatrice!”\r\n\r\nAll looked as General Mainwarren spoke and saw approaching in their\r\ndirection Beatrice Cuming in company with four other ladies. The\r\nmembers of the party seated themselves a slight distance away.\r\n\r\n“Who is that beautiful girl taking her place beside your daughter?”\r\nasked the Professor of Colonel Cuming.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” exclaimed Kearns explosively; “so the man of science has an eye\r\nfor feminine beauty, eh! Look out, Professor, that in spite of your\r\nhundred odd years, you don’t get enmeshed. Let me see this beauty.\r\nWhew! But the man is right. Beautiful! Why, she’s a dream--a lovely\r\ndream! What eyes--what teeth!”\r\n\r\n“Who is she?” repeated the Professor.\r\n\r\n“That,” answered Colonel Cuming, “is the lady to whom you heard\r\nBeatrice refer--Miss Dorothy Brandon, a distant cousin of Beatrice and\r\none of the maids of honor to Her Majesty, the Queen.”\r\n\r\n“And are the other three ladies also maids of honor?” asked Kearns,\r\nwith a sly glance at General Mainwarren.\r\n\r\n“No,” answered the General, smiling; “not exactly maids of honor,\r\nalthough each holds position at the Court. The tall brunette, with the\r\nbold dark eyes, and the tiara of diamonds flashing above her dark hair,\r\nis the Countess Brooke, one of the most handsome women and, I might\r\nperhaps add, credited with being one of the most dangerous intrigantes\r\nof the Court. She has a clever and a dangerous tongue and is sometimes\r\nstyled ‘the Babbling Brooke,’ after a certain famous beauty of one of\r\nthe old-time English Courts, whom this lady in many respects strongly\r\nresembles. You see, history repeats itself.”\r\n\r\n“And the other two ladies?”\r\n\r\n“The shorter brunette, with the heavy dark brows, the brilliant red\r\nlips and the big brown eyes is the Baroness Maquehaye, a great leader\r\nof fashion and a wonderful entertainer. Her garden-party of last Spring\r\nis still talked about. The tall, rather plump blonde lady, on the other\r\nside of the Countess, is Lady Hadley-Barton, famed for her social\r\nambitions. Ah, I see there is going to be an addition to the party.”\r\n\r\nAs the General spoke two army officers, each clad in the dashing\r\nuniform of the Imperial Guard, advanced and greeted the ladies. One of\r\nthem was a man of magnificent physique, tall, and lithe, with clear,\r\nflashing blue eyes and a sweeping blond moustache; the other was\r\nshorter, dark, with kindly brown eyes and of sinewy, well-knit figure.\r\n\r\n“A pair of remarkably clean-cut, fine-looking men,” commented Kearns,\r\n“although I have no doubt that uniform helps matters along a good deal.\r\nWho are they?”\r\n\r\n“You see in them,” answered General Mainwarren, “two of the bravest and\r\nmost dashing young officers of the army. Both of them performed deeds\r\nof daring in the late war with Russia which made their names ring\r\nthroughout the country and made them the objects of the usual popular\r\nidolatry which the American people have ever been wont to lavish, for a\r\nshort time at least, upon their heroes. See that peculiar-shaped star\r\nwhich each wears among the decorations on his breast. It’s the Star\r\nof Columbia, the most coveted decoration of all the many decorations\r\nwhich this Court boasts. It’s the decoration which is conferred only\r\nfor special valor in actual face of the enemy. Both these men wear it\r\nand both have earned it. They’ve been recently ordered to Court to join\r\nthe Imperial Guard. Here they’re show-pieces. Shame to it that gallant\r\nsoldiers should not be put to better uses! The taller of the two is\r\nCaptain Stanley Mortimer; the other, Captain Ralph Swords.”\r\n\r\nThe two officers talked for some time in lively strain with the ladies\r\nof the party, the brunt of the conversation being borne by the Countess\r\nBrooke, who leveled several witching glances at the tall guardsman.\r\nThen Captain Mortimer offered his arm to Dorothy and, followed by\r\nCaptain Swords escorting Beatrice, he led the way to the dancing-floor.\r\nFrom the orchestra came the opening strains of a waltz.\r\n\r\nAlthough the dancers were already taking their positions upon the\r\nfloor, Beatrice insisted upon stopping as they passed her father’s\r\nparty and, following her usual impetuous methods, hurried general\r\npresentations ensued. Miss Brandon smiled upon the Professor and\r\nmurmured a few pleasant words; and Captain Mortimer extended a frank,\r\nsoldierly invitation to Kearns to visit him at his quarters next day.\r\nThen the two couples passed on to mingle a moment later in the maze of\r\nwaltzers.\r\n\r\nMore bewitching grew the sensuous strains of the waltz, faster and\r\nfaster flew the steps of the dancers, as Captain Stanley Mortimer,\r\nholding Dorothy lightly clasped, circled the floor. He had caught her\r\nstep to a nicety and they whirled in perfect rhythmic unison. Her\r\nbreath was upon his cheek, a loosened strand of her hair touched his\r\nlips, her form nestled more closely in his arms. As the last bars\r\nof the music died away, her eyes met his in one fleeting, upward\r\nglance--half coy, half enraptured--and he slowly bent his head in a\r\nmotion that was almost a caress.\r\n\r\nBut as they danced, a pair of black eyes, flashing under heavy dark\r\nbrows, had watched with unfriendly glances, and the dainty lace\r\nhandkerchief between the jeweled fingers of the Countess Brooke was\r\ndefaced by two jagged rents.\r\n\r\nCaptain Mortimer led Dorothy back to her seat.\r\n\r\n“The fourth waltz is to be mine?” he murmured.\r\n\r\n“As you will,” she whispered back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nIN THE GARDENS OF THE KING\r\n\r\n\r\n“They belonged to the Tenth Dragoons before being transferred to the\r\nImperial Guard?” asked the Baroness Maquehaye.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the Countess Brooke, “both Captain Mortimer and Captain\r\nSwords belonged to the Tenth and the Regiment was quartered at the\r\nSummer Palace at Oldport. However, Lady Hadley-Barton can tell us more\r\nabout that, as she spent the Summer at Oldport. I was there only toward\r\nthe close.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes,” exclaimed Lady Hadley-Barton effusively, “and a delightful\r\nseason we had, too! The officers of the Tenth were simply too lovely.\r\nIt was one succession of receptions and balls and excursions and\r\ncoaching parties. Never had Oldport known such a gay season as while\r\nthe ‘Fighting Tenth’ was there. They entertained us day and night.\r\nReally, they took the place by storm and we surrendered ourselves to\r\nthem unconditionally.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?” replied the Countess Brooke, with the suspicion of a sneer in\r\nthe slightly upraised eyebrow and curve of the lip.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” continued Lady Hadley-Barton, “never was there a regiment--not\r\neven the Imperial Guard--which contained so many handsome, dashing men\r\nand such excellent entertainers. As I say, they captured us completely.\r\nOf course, you will take me figuratively.”\r\n\r\n“There was some little scandal, though, toward the close of the season,\r\nif I remember rightly,” commented Countess Brooke.\r\n\r\n“Scandal?” questioned Baroness Maquehaye.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Countess Brooke, “in connection with the high gaming\r\nin the mess-room of the Tenth. Several young men, it’s said, were\r\ncompletely ruined.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” exclaimed Lady Hadley-Barton, “it’s true there was some\r\ngossip, but what of it? One expects a little scandalizing whenever a\r\ncompany of gay soldiers is on the ground. Of course, you will take me\r\nfiguratively.”\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t seem so astonishing to me,” remarked Baroness Maquehaye,\r\n“that soldiers, especially after a long and arduous campaign, should go\r\nin for heavy gaming. The risks and chances of play must replace with\r\nthem to some extent the risks and chances of war. What particular form\r\nof play did they indulge in?”\r\n\r\n“Baccarat,” answered Countess Brooke, “and the bids for the bank, I\r\nunderstand, used to run up into thousands of crowns. There was a bank\r\nbid in one night under certain peculiar circumstances--circumstances\r\nwhich will, no doubt, be long remembered by the successful bidder,\r\nCaptain Mortimer.”\r\n\r\nAt the mention of the name, Dorothy, who had been engaged in\r\nconversation with Beatrice, slightly turned her head. Every word that\r\nfollowed, in the distinct, crisp tones of the Countess, fell clearly\r\nupon her listening ear.\r\n\r\n“Do tell us the story,” exclaimed Baroness Maquehaye. “It sounds as if\r\nit were likely to be interesting.”\r\n\r\n“Quite a romance, although, perhaps, slightly sordid,” continued the\r\nCountess Brooke carelessly. “Well, it seems that on a particular night\r\nthe play was very heavy--unusually heavy even for the mess-room of the\r\nTenth. Captain Mortimer had been a fairly good winner during the early\r\npart of the season, but later encountered a long spell of ill-luck,\r\nwhich often sets in with those who woo the fickle goddess of chance. He\r\nhad been losing heavily and in the strong play of that night thought he\r\nsaw a chance to recoup. A bank was put up and under spirited bidding\r\nwent into the thousands.”\r\n\r\nHere the Countess paused, with the dramatic effect of a good\r\n_raconteuse_.\r\n\r\n“Your story is quite interesting,” exclaimed Baroness Maquehaye. “Do go\r\non.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes; do,” added Lady Hadley-Barton, “I love to hear of the wicked\r\ndoings of those soldiers. In fact, as I told Major Packenham, of the\r\nTenth, the wickeder the soldier the more I seem to worship him.”\r\n\r\n“I trust he took you--figuratively,” remarked the Countess.\r\n\r\n“Quite so; quite so,” Lady Hadley-Barton hastened to respond.\r\n\r\n“Pray proceed,” urged Baroness Maquehaye.\r\n\r\n“Well,” continued the Countess Brooke, “the bank which had been bid up\r\ninto the thousands was finally awarded to the highest bidder--Captain\r\nStanley Mortimer.”\r\n\r\nDorothy Brandon stirred slightly in her seat and her pink-and-white ear\r\nveered slightly around in the direction of the narrator.\r\n\r\n“The Captain threw down on the table the sum representing the capital\r\nof the bank and took his seat in the banker’s chair.”\r\n\r\nAgain the Countess paused, as if seeking to recall the full details of\r\nher story.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” exclaimed Baroness Maquehaye, “and then----?”\r\n\r\n“I can imagine the scene,” declared Lady Hadley-Barton impulsively;\r\n“the green table, the stacks of money, the high players. How I wish I\r\nhad been there. How much we women miss! I have so often wished I wore\r\ntrousers. Of course, you will take me figuratively.”\r\n\r\n“Captain Mortimer took his seat in the banker’s chair,” resumed\r\nthe Countess, “and as he did so he looked upon those about him.\r\n‘Gentlemen,’ he said, ‘luck has been to me lately a sorry jade. Let’s\r\nsee if she will now mend her ways. If she doesn’t and you succeed in\r\nbreaking this bank, there’s nothing left to me but to surrender the\r\nfreedom and the joys of happy bachelorhood, accept the offer which I\r\nhave of a command in the Imperial Guard, go to Court and--marry an\r\nheiress. Now, gentlemen, proceed and do your worst.’”\r\n\r\n“How delightfully dramatic,” exclaimed Lady Hadley-Barton.\r\n\r\n“Well, and what happened next?” eagerly inquired Baroness Maquehaye.\r\n\r\n“Fortune favored the gallant Captain at one time and it looked as if\r\nhe might escape the dire fate of having to sell his prized liberty to\r\nthe God of Mammon, as represented in the person of an heiress. But the\r\nluck veered and set in heavily against the bank. The right tableau\r\nwon steadily; but the left--the one nearest the banker’s heart, you\r\nwill observe--did the mischief. There came a heavy coup, both tableaux\r\nwinning, and the bank was broken.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” exclaimed Baroness Maquehaye with tense interest.\r\n\r\n“The poor Captain!” remarked Lady Hadley-Barton.\r\n\r\n“Captain Mortimer showed not the least perturbation,” resumed Countess\r\nBrooke. “He rose from the table, lighted a cigar and, turning to those\r\nabout him, said: ‘I congratulate you, gentlemen, but that settles it\r\nfor me. Now for the Court and--the heiress!’”\r\n\r\n“I call that an interesting story,” exclaimed Lady Hadley-Barton.\r\n“Strange I hadn’t heard it before.”\r\n\r\n“Interesting, perhaps, but decidedly mercenary,” commented Baroness\r\nMaquehaye with some show of disdain.\r\n\r\n“Mercenary!” echoed Countess Brooke, “surely you’re severe. Call it _un\r\nmariage de convenance_--or of necessity, if you will--it sounds more\r\npretty! Isn’t the Captain a decidedly presentable man and one famed for\r\nhis bravery in the war? Won’t the heiress who buys him with her gold\r\nsecure her money’s worth?”\r\n\r\nA little man--dapper and smiling--dressed in the uniform of the French\r\ndiplomatic corps, the red ribbon of the _Legion d’Honeur_ at his\r\nbuttonhole, presented himself at that moment before Dorothy. To his\r\nprofound bow and extended arm she returned a dazed stare. Her face was\r\nstrangely strained and pale. The little man was fairly taken aback.\r\n\r\n“You promised me zis dance, you know, Mees Brandon,” he stammered. “I\r\nam quite sure I have not made mistake as to ze numbaire. I----”\r\n\r\nMechanically she arose, accepted the proferred arm and went toward the\r\ndancing-floor.\r\n\r\n“You are not indisposed, I trust,” he inquired solicitously.\r\n\r\n“Count D’Arville,” she exclaimed impulsively, with a pressure ever\r\nso slight upon his gold-laced sleeve, “I know how gallant are the\r\ngentlemen of France and that you are _le plus galant des galants_.\r\nYou’ll do me a favor, won’t you?”\r\n\r\nThe Count’s face reddened in a pleasurable flush.\r\n\r\n“Ah, _mademoiselle_,” he exclaimed excitedly, and almost losing command\r\nof his limited stock of English, “if I shall do you a favor? It will\r\ngive me pleasure, as you know, to lay down ze life for you. I await ze\r\nhonor of your commands.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Count,” said Dorothy simply, her blue eyes flashing upon\r\nhim a grateful smile, “I knew you would. I want you to forego this\r\ndance. You won’t mind, will you?”\r\n\r\nA look of disappointment came into Count D’Arville’s face.\r\n\r\n“It is a great deprivation, _mademoiselle_, but I am your slave.”\r\n\r\n“Instead,” continued Dorothy, “you will take me to the conservatory.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And there you’ll leave me alone--entirely alone--for a few moments,\r\nreturning for me at the end of the dance.”\r\n\r\n“You are ill, _mademoiselle_?”\r\n\r\n“No, no; I assure you.”\r\n\r\n“Is there nothing I can do?”\r\n\r\nAnother light pressure on the Count’s resplendent sleeve.\r\n\r\n“Remember, _monsieur le comte_,” she said, “that he who would serve\r\nwell must yield blindly. You wish to serve well?”\r\n\r\nThe speech was accompanied by another adroit smile, before which the\r\nCount retired utterly routed--horse, foot and dragoons.\r\n\r\n“_Pardi! mademoiselle_,” he answered with effusion, “to hear you is for\r\nme to obey. It shall be as you will.”\r\n\r\nHe accordingly conducted her to the conservatory--an immense structure\r\nof great length and breadth, resembling more a miniature park than\r\na place ordinarily designated under the name of conservatory. Here\r\nand there tropical trees and massive plants stretched their foliage\r\nin wide, overhanging branches; there were by-paths and niches and\r\nbowers in the winding gardens; and at intervals fountains, under whose\r\nlimpid waters flashed golden fishes, gushed forth amid the violets\r\nand the roses. It was a dream of floral splendor--such opulence and\r\nmagnificence as had never been dreamed even by luxurious Eastern\r\npotentates of the olden days. It was the Western world saying to the\r\nEastern: “You bragged in the old days of your Oriental sumptuousness\r\nand luxury, but yours was only a poor affair, after all! See what we\r\ncan do, with modern money and modern methods!”\r\n\r\nInto this great garden of the King, Count D’Arville led Dorothy. He\r\nescorted her to a secluded spot under the branches of a Taribou tree\r\nand with numerous bows and protestations left her.\r\n\r\nWhen, at the close of the dance a few minutes later, he returned to her\r\nside, she rewarded him with a gracious smile.\r\n\r\n“You’ve been of great service to me, _monsieur le comte_,” she said.\r\n“Now, please take me back. I am engaged for the next waltz--the fourth,\r\nyou know. Ah, I have one other service to ask of you!”\r\n\r\n“It is, _mademoiselle_?”\r\n\r\n“The dance after that--after the fourth waltz, I mean--I have promised\r\nto Lord Ashley. Will you kindly tell Lord Ashley that he will find me\r\nin the conservatory--at this spot?”\r\n\r\nCount D’Arville bowed.\r\n\r\n“I will bear your commands to Milord Ashley,” he said, “but after\r\nzat--later on--may I not have my lost dance?”\r\n\r\nA weary look came into her face.\r\n\r\n“After that--after Lord Ashley--I’ll dance no more to-night,” she said.\r\n“But,” she hastened to add, “I’ll make it up to you. At the ball next\r\nweek you shall have two.”\r\n\r\nQuite elated with this promise, the gallant Count reluctantly\r\nsurrendered her to her partner for the fourth waltz, Captain Stanley\r\nMortimer.\r\n\r\nAgain he held her in his arms, as he skilfully guided her amid the\r\nwhirling dancers; again he felt her breath upon his cheek; again her\r\nupturned eyes met his--smiling, ecstatic, dreamy--and into their depths\r\nhe looked with tenderness. He was vaguely conscious of her warm and\r\nyielding form pressed to his; of the rise and fall of her firm, white\r\nbosom and throat; of a strange, rare perfume, that seemed to exhale\r\nfrom her dress, from amid the glittering gold of her hair, intoxicating\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHis heart beating wildly, his whole being filling, thrilling, with a\r\nwild ecstasy of hope and of love, on and on they danced until the last\r\nbars of the waltz had been played out and the dance came to an end.\r\n\r\nFor a moment they stood silent. Then, with a murmured suggestion as to\r\nthe warmth of the ball-room, he led her to the conservatory. Slowly\r\nthey wandered along the winding paths until--unconsciously as it\r\nseemed--they reached a secluded seat under the outstretched branches of\r\na wide-leafed Taribou tree.\r\n\r\nFor some moments they sat there--speechless, almost motionless. A\r\ngreat wave of emotion surged within him. Never in the wildest charges\r\ninto the gray-coated Russian ranks, nor in the bloody night attack\r\nupon Varshava, nor when he had spiked the great gun on the heights of\r\nVladivik, had his heart beat so wildly. He longed to speak and yet a\r\nspecies of dread--a coward fear--overawed him.\r\n\r\nWith an effort, he drew himself together and turned to her. She raised\r\nher eyes to his. Then the pent-up words suddenly rushed to his lips and\r\nin a mad, wild torrent of eloquence and love he poured forth to her the\r\nhope of his soul.\r\n\r\nWith his first words her eyes sank and with drooped head she listened,\r\nwithout sign or movement, to the very end. Then, as with hope and\r\ndoubt--doubt and hope--tearing at his heart, he waited one breathless\r\nmoment, she slowly rose to her feet and turned her eyes full upon his\r\nface. He caught a light in them which brought him, staggering, to his\r\nfeet. He faced her with straining eyes and features tense and rigid--as\r\na man awaiting his death blow. As last she spoke:\r\n\r\n“You certainly play the part well, Captain Mortimer--so well one might\r\nalmost believe it true. Really, I congratulate you.”\r\n\r\n“Play--a part! What can you mean?”\r\n\r\n“That the Tenth has indeed lost in Captain Mortimer a great player,\r\nalike in amateur theatricals and at--baccarat.”\r\n\r\nA man appeared, the light flashing from the decorations upon his\r\nbreast, as he came slowly along the garden path.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” he repeated blankly. “I--do--not--understand.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed? Ah! here comes Lord Ashley. Pray excuse me. My next dance is\r\nhis.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nA NIGHT ALARM\r\n\r\n\r\n“A crown for your thoughts, Professor!” said General Mainwarren to\r\nProfessor Dean, as the latter sat thoughtfully watching the dancers.\r\n\r\nThe Professor aroused himself with a slight start.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I was allowing my thoughts to drift idly in many currents,” he\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n“For instance, if it is not impertinent to inquire?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I was marveling at the beauty, the luxury and the splendor\r\nof all this, and thinking what it must cost to keep up. The thought\r\noccurred to me that the cost of this one ball”--and the Professor shot\r\na sharp glance at General Mainwarren--“would probably be sufficient\r\nto keep warm all the poor people in your district who are likely\r\nto suffer, according to what you told us, for coal this Winter, in\r\naddition to supplying every poor child with a Christmas box.”\r\n\r\n“A Christmas box!” exclaimed General Mainwarren. “What a quaint\r\nreminiscence wafted to us from the past!”\r\n\r\n“How do you mean--‘a quaint reminiscence’?”\r\n\r\n“Why, my dear Professor, Christmas boxes are with us as much a thing\r\nof the past as the curfew bell, knights in armor, or any of the other\r\ncustoms of mediæval times.”\r\n\r\n“How came this kindly practice to be abolished?” asked the Professor\r\nblankly.\r\n\r\n“Kindly!” repeated General Mainwarren. “I can’t agree with you. The\r\ncustom was discontinued long ago by the wealthier classes and the rest\r\nof the people gradually followed. It was one of the few good acts which\r\nthe rich have done for the poor; one of the many features in which our\r\nsocial organization of to-day excels yours.”\r\n\r\n“But what leads you to this view?”\r\n\r\n“Why,” explained General Mainwarren, “your giving of Christmas presents\r\nwas nothing less than the refinement of cruelty upon a colossal scale.\r\nThink of the tens of thousands of heart yearnings and of heart aches\r\nwhich must have been caused in your day owing to this custom. It was\r\nall very nice for the well-to-do, but think of the tens of thousands\r\nwho felt forced to give what they couldn’t afford; of those who wished\r\nto give but could not; of those--especially little children--who hoped\r\nto receive and were disappointed. Think of the destitute father looking\r\nupon his children as they wistfully watched the toys and presents\r\nreceived by more fortunate playfellows. What were the feelings in that\r\nparent’s heart, what the feelings of the child’s? Ah! your Christmas\r\nwas a cruel time and your custom a cruel one.”\r\n\r\n“Viewed in that light,” answered Professor Dean gravely, “I will admit\r\nthere are grounds for your criticism. You say there are other features\r\nof improvement. Tell me of them. I’m interested.”\r\n\r\n“The subject is rather too extensive to go into at the present time,”\r\nanswered General Mainwarren, “but I’ll mention one or two instances\r\nwhich happen to come to my mind at the moment. Take our newspapers, for\r\nexample. We don’t allow our newspapers to promote national blindness\r\nas in your day. The smallest size of type which may be used, as also\r\nnumerous other details as to the printing of a newspaper, are carefully\r\nregulated by law in the interests of the public eyesight.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all a bad idea!” commented the Professor.\r\n\r\n“Then, again, take our attitude toward drunkenness. We have recognized\r\nthat what drove men to frenzy in drink and largely promoted drunkenness\r\nwas not so much the liquor itself as the adulterations in the liquor.\r\nOur methods of inspection of all liquors publicly sold, as also of the\r\npublic food supply, are very elaborate, and our laws on the subject of\r\nadulteration are extremely stringent. In this respect, I am glad to\r\nsay, our people are immeasurably better off than were the people of\r\nyour day.”\r\n\r\n“You speak in a kindly way of the people and seem to have their welfare\r\nat heart,” ventured the Professor. “This being so, I am astonished that\r\nyou don’t reverse your policy.”\r\n\r\n“My policy----?”\r\n\r\n“As to the restriction of the coal supply.”\r\n\r\nGeneral Mainwarren started slightly.\r\n\r\n“I must ask you to excuse me from discussing that,” he answered,\r\nsomewhat stiffly.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said the Professor, slightly nettled, “but there is one\r\nother point upon which I think I have a right to receive your answer.\r\nIt is this: Under Colonel Cuming’s roof, you will remember, you\r\nsomewhat bitterly arraigned the men of my day.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I remember perfectly,” replied General Mainwarren. “Conceding\r\nthat the mass of people have certain rights, I claimed that the\r\nresponsibility for present conditions lies with the people of your day,\r\nbecause they did not check the tendency of events in their incipiency.\r\nOf course,” he added cautiously, “I haven’t accepted as correct your\r\nviews as to these rights. It was purely an academic discussion and I\r\nconceded your point simply for the sake of argument.”\r\n\r\n“I understand the point you make,” rejoined the Professor. “I was taken\r\nsomewhat unawares at the time, but the matter has been rankling in my\r\nmind since. May I ask what were the methods which you later critics\r\nthink we might have adopted to this end?”\r\n\r\n“My dear Professor,” protested General Mainwarren, “that’s a subject\r\nwhich to treat fully would call for most extended discussion. Suffice\r\nit to say, that in those days the people had the free exercise of the\r\nballot and with their votes they could have done pretty well what they\r\npleased.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you really think so!” exclaimed the Professor with some sarcasm.\r\n“You forget our great political machines, and that they practically\r\ncontrolled affairs; substantially, even if covertly, directing the\r\nso-called will of the people!”\r\n\r\n“I’m fully aware of that,” answered General Mainwarren, “but the man\r\nwho stands idly beneath a tree, with open mouth, awaiting the fruit\r\nto drop, is apt to go away disappointed. What was needed was a slow,\r\nsteady, methodical education of the people, which would have placed\r\nthem upon a higher plane. With eyes fully opened to the situation,\r\nthey would have been superior to the two great political machines.\r\nThere seems to have been no steady, earnest, well-directed effort to\r\naccomplish this--no one to undertake it!”\r\n\r\n“How might this have been done?” questioned the Professor.\r\n\r\n“Oh, in various ways.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me one?”\r\n\r\n“Since you insist, my dear Professor,” answered the General, “I’ll\r\npoint out one way which has been suggested and which I had the\r\npleasure of discussing some time ago with one of our most eminent\r\nsociologists, Doctor Arthur Melbourne.”\r\n\r\n“I’m all interest!” exclaimed the Professor. “That way was?”\r\n\r\n“You have intimated,” continued General Mainwarren, “that the\r\npolitical machines held the voters so securely that the power of these\r\nprofessional politicians could not be overthrown by any opposition\r\nwhich was started against them. You have not said, but I know it,\r\nthat such desultory opposition as was tried from time to time always\r\nmet with discouragement and defeat. Nor have you pointed out that\r\nthe leaders who controlled these two great political machines were\r\nthemselves controlled by the moneyed powers of the land, who stood\r\nin the background and pulled the strings which moved the puppets.\r\nThis--all this--is well realized and understood by the student of\r\nto-day.”\r\n\r\n“Let us concede these facts,” rejoined the Professor; “but what then?”\r\n\r\n“It has been suggested,” continued General Mainwarren, “that a wise\r\ncourse for patriotic leaders of your day would have been to have\r\nabandoned the hope of converting and securing the grown voters as a\r\nbody. It would have been best for them, at a given time, to have said:\r\n‘Beginning from to-day, we will pay no attention to any male who is\r\nmore than fifteen years of age and who is now, or within the next six\r\nyears will be, entitled to a vote. But we will direct all efforts to\r\nan entirely new body of suffragists.’ They should then have turned\r\ntheir attention to the _women of the land_, to the mothers of future\r\ngenerations of voters. It has been said that ‘Every woman is at heart\r\na royalist!’ It could with equal truth be said, ‘Every woman is by\r\nnature a politician.’ It is true that women, as a body, appear to\r\ndevote little interest to politics, but this is because few women have\r\nbeen given opportunity of acquiring any knowledge on the subject, or\r\nof taking active part in such matters. But whenever woman has had such\r\nopportunity, she has shown herself to be an ardent politician. Look\r\nat the influence exerted politically by various women of whom history\r\nspeaks. Take it even in your own day. Whenever there happened to be\r\nsome movement--say a moral reform movement--in which the women of the\r\ncountry took an active interest, as they did now and again, did it not\r\ninvariably happen that that movement was successful at the polls?”\r\n\r\nThe Professor reflected a moment.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he answered; “the facts show that you are correct as to this.”\r\n\r\n“There, then,” continued General Mainwarren, “lay the hope and the\r\nchance of your patriotic leaders. They should have started missionary\r\nwork upon a comprehensive scale among the women of the land. They\r\nshould have educated womankind politically--have indicated to woman\r\nwhere and why the shoe pinched and what was the remedy. She should have\r\nbeen shown that the remedy lay in the generations of voters to come and\r\nthat those generations were directly under her influence and in her\r\nkeeping.”\r\n\r\n“I begin to see your drift,” said the Professor thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“Meetings should have been held for the instruction of women; political\r\nclubs maintained; and literature circulated for them which was\r\nsufficiently light, clear and instructive. ‘Do you want your sons to\r\nstruggle on under the same blighting, toilsome conditions as their\r\nfathers struggled?’ should have been the watchword, and it would\r\nhave been a watchword to which the maternal heart would eagerly have\r\nresponded. The women would have educated their children--not merely\r\nthe boys but also the girls who were to become the wives of future\r\nvoters--and within a very few years you would have had a new generation\r\nof voters sufficiently powerful and sufficiently well-instructed to\r\nhave bid the old political machines open and successful defiance. With\r\nthe women of the land lay one of your great chances, but that chance\r\nyou utterly neglected.”\r\n\r\nThe Professor was about to reply when the voice of Kearns, who had been\r\nin conversation with Colonel Cuming, broke in upon them:\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, Professor,” he exclaimed, “but I see their Majesties have\r\nlong since retired and the ball-room is beginning to thin out somewhat.\r\nIsn’t it time we went? No doubt all this life and go and all these\r\nbeautiful ladies are very interesting to you--in spite of your hundred\r\nyears--but you must remember that I have work before me to-morrow. I’m\r\nno longer a gentleman of leisure, you know.”\r\n\r\nBefore the Professor could reply, Colonel Cuming again addressed\r\nKearns, directing his attention to some personage in the ball-room, and\r\nthe Professor turned to General Mainwarren.\r\n\r\n“No longer a gentleman of leisure,” he said, rather sadly; “that, too,\r\nwas one of the subjects in my mind. I was thinking what I should turn\r\nto--what place I could find, if any--in this new world into which I\r\nhave tumbled. Our friend, Kearns, has been fortunate in finding his\r\nold-time cunning in demand, even at the hands of kings. But I wonder\r\nif I can in these days profitably resume my former researches and\r\nwork. Would there be any demand for the various inventions I have in\r\nmind--my air-ship, for instance?”\r\n\r\nGeneral Mainwarren started perceptibly.\r\n\r\n“Professor Dean,” he said gravely, “I have had a high regard for you\r\nfrom the moment of our first meeting. In fact, long before that your\r\nname was known to me and your attainments in the domain of science held\r\nmy respect. Ah, Professor, you have probably done for the world more\r\nthan you know!”\r\n\r\n“Come, come, General!” exclaimed the Professor, “this is sheer\r\nflattery. You are amusing yourself at my expense, I fear. I hardly\r\nexpected this of you.”\r\n\r\n“I speak only the truth!” said the General solemnly.\r\n\r\n“We will let that pass,” replied the Professor somewhat testily. “You\r\nhave not yet answered my question. Do you think the invention I have\r\nmentioned would find any market in these days?”\r\n\r\n“I was coming to that point,” answered General Mainwarren. “I see\r\nno reason why your--your--invention when completed should not yield\r\nbeneficial results.”\r\n\r\n“Completed!” replied the Professor, “as far as that is concerned, it is\r\nsubstantially completed.”\r\n\r\n“Perfected!” exclaimed General Mainwarren, with an air of astonishment.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the Professor.\r\n\r\n“You could in--in--a comparatively short time,” resumed General\r\nMainwarren, “turn out a practical air-ship! Do you mean this?”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely,” replied the Professor confidently.\r\n\r\nGeneral Mainwarren reflected for some moments.\r\n\r\n“Professor Dean,” he said presently, “I’ll make you a proposition.\r\nUnder these new conditions you need someone to guide your efforts and\r\nto properly market the product of your brain. I invite you to come\r\nwith me to Pennsylvania, and pursue your researches and your work.\r\nIt will be a mutual enterprise. As for the terms, there will be no\r\ndifference between us as to that; they shall be of your own making.”\r\n\r\n“You mean this?” exclaimed the Professor in astonishment.\r\n\r\n“Positively,” answered General Mainwarren firmly; “I make you this\r\nas an offer. You are to pursue your researches and your work at your\r\nleisure and I am to supply such funds, or other promotive assistance,\r\nas may be needed. The benefits accruing we’ll share jointly, upon\r\nsuch terms as you yourself shall dictate. It’s a simple business\r\nproposition. Do you accept?”\r\n\r\n“The conditions are certainly most liberal!” exclaimed the Professor.\r\n“I----”\r\n\r\n“Why, then, do you hesitate?”\r\n\r\n“May I ask when this offer is to go into effect?”\r\n\r\n“Immediately.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” exclaimed the Professor deprecatingly, “I don’t want to leave my\r\nfriend Kearns so suddenly. I must ask for some time in which to reach a\r\ndecision.”\r\n\r\n“By all means,” answered General Mainwarren, “but I ask it as a\r\ncondition that you will not enter into any negotiation or discussion\r\non this subject with outsiders until you have given me an answer. In\r\na word, you are to treat this proposition as entirely confidential\r\nbetween us. Have I your word for this?”\r\n\r\nThe words had scarcely left General Mainwarren’s lips and before\r\nthe Professor could make reply, there came from the grounds outside\r\nthe palace the sharp blast of a bugle, hoarse shouts of command and\r\nthe sounds of moving men. In an instant the scene in the ball-room\r\nchanged from one of gayety and frivolity to earnestness, joined to some\r\nconfusion. Military officers quitted their partners and hurried forth,\r\nwhile the beautifully gowned women looked into one another’s faces\r\nwith questioning glances. The diplomats gathered in little groups,\r\nexchanging whispers. A current of unrest, of uneasiness, had suddenly\r\nswept over the brilliant scene--a general presentiment that something\r\nmomentous had happened.\r\n\r\nAgain the bugles pealed forth, with a roll of drums in the distance.\r\nStill the guests sat, or stood, looking askance into one another’s\r\nfaces. The music stopped.\r\n\r\nUneasy lies the head that wears a crown. It seemed as if the familiar\r\nwords might be paraphrased: “Uneasy are those who live within the\r\nshadow of a throne.”\r\n\r\nA messenger entered the ball-room and, glancing about him, made his way\r\nto where Kearns sat. There was agitation in his manner and his words\r\ncame sharp and terse:\r\n\r\n“You are commanded, sir, to repair at once to His Majesty’s chamber.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nHOW CAME THIS TO PASS\r\n\r\n\r\nOut of the ball-room the messenger rapidly led the way. They were\r\nwhisked up on an electric elevator; and along a passage, lined with\r\nsentinels, they hurried until they reached the private apartments of\r\nthe King.\r\n\r\nIn the first, or outer, chamber were gathered several officers, talking\r\ntogether eagerly. They passed through the chamber to a door at the\r\nfurther end, where they were stopped by a Captain of the Guards,\r\nwho was evidently the officer on duty. At a whispered word from the\r\nmessenger, the officer moved aside. The messenger opened the door\r\nand, stepping back, motioned Kearns to pass in alone to the sleeping\r\napartment of the King.\r\n\r\nKearns instantly took in the details of the scene which presented\r\nitself as the door closed behind him--a spacious and brilliantly\r\nlighted apartment, with a rather small alcove in which was set the\r\nroyal couch. Two persons were in the apartment--the King, seated on the\r\nside of the couch, his face pale and troubled, holding a paper in his\r\nhand; and, standing beside him, Lord Ashley, looking very grave.\r\n\r\nLying in disorder at the King’s feet was a large coverlid of gayly\r\ncolored silk, which appeared to have been thrown or dropped on the\r\nfloor in the confusion.\r\n\r\nThe King motioned to Kearns to approach. Kearns advanced and bowed.\r\n\r\n“See!” said the King.\r\n\r\nHe motioned to Lord Ashley, who raised the silken coverlid. Kearns bent\r\neagerly forward and, despite the royal presence, a sharp, low whistle\r\nof astonishment escaped him.\r\n\r\nStretched at full length upon the floor, his limbs rigid in death,\r\nthe thick blood oozing from nostrils and mouth, lay the King’s great\r\nmastiff, with a bullet through his heart.\r\n\r\nKearns stood gazing intently at the corpse; then raised his eyes to\r\nglance about him for possible clews as to the quarter whence death had\r\nbeen dealt. But the King again drew his attention.\r\n\r\n“Read!” he said, extending to Kearns the scroll he held in his hand.\r\n\r\nKearns took the paper, which was thick and heavy and was rolled in the\r\nform of a cylinder. Unfolding it he read:\r\n\r\n_The bullet which pierces your dog’s heart might as readily have\r\nreached yours. Heed the warnings given while it is yet time. The hour\r\nfast approaches._\r\n\r\nKearns slowly read the document, refolded it carefully and, still\r\nholding it in his hand, addressed the King.\r\n\r\n“I’d like to keep this,” he said, “for further examination. I can’t\r\ntell but it may contain a clew.”\r\n\r\n“As you will,” answered the King abstractedly. “You note what is said:\r\nAs the bullet pierced the dog’s heart, so might it have pierced ours.\r\nAnd it’s true,” he added with a shudder, “horribly true! As the late\r\nCzar of Russia, Zoldau the First, foully perished, so----”\r\n\r\nLord Ashley hastily interrupted.\r\n\r\n“You forget, Sire,” he exclaimed, “that while it’s true His Majesty,\r\nthe late Czar, Zoldau the First, died suddenly while asleep, yet it was\r\nofficially certified to by the Court physicians that he died of acute\r\nindigestion superinduced by----”\r\n\r\n“A dagger, driven through his heart while he slept,” interposed the\r\nKing. “Yes,” he added with ghastly irony, “such things usually are\r\nacutely indigestible.”\r\n\r\n“Sire,” said Lord Ashley, “there are certain State secrets which His\r\nGrace, the Lord Chancellor, would, I know, highly disapprove being\r\ndisclosed. It is not well that such rumors----”\r\n\r\n“Rumors!” exclaimed the King with violence, “think you, Milord, that\r\nthese things are safely locked within the walls of the Chancellery!\r\nThink you that such secrets are securely hidden? that they are not\r\nwhispered about among the people? Ah, don’t deceive yourself. But what\r\ncare we as to this! All the efforts of our officers, our soldiers, our\r\nSecret Service have failed to protect us from these visitations. We\r\nwould that he,” and he turned to Kearns, “should know all that he may\r\nfully grasp the necessities of the situation and measure the danger.”\r\n\r\nLord Ashley bowed a respectful acquiescence.\r\n\r\n“It’s horrible--horrible!” continued the King with nervous energy.\r\n“It’s easy enough to face death in a charge against the enemy as you\r\nsoldiers face it, but to wait and watch day after day, day after day,\r\nnever knowing from what quarter death may be creeping upon you from\r\nsome lurking assassin--ah, that’s different. It’s horrible--horrible!”\r\n\r\nKearns looked upon the King and a feeling akin to pity came into his\r\nheart. In the course of his varied career, he had seen men in a similar\r\npredicament and he well knew that this constant fear of attack from\r\nsome mysterious and unknown quarter was a situation such as to wring\r\nthe stoutest heart.\r\n\r\nThe King drew himself together with a strong effort.\r\n\r\n“Whence came this shot?” he asked again turning to Kearns.\r\n\r\nKearns glanced about him. There were four windows to the apartment;\r\ntwo of these were closed; the others were open. All four windows were\r\nsecurely shaded with heavy blinds. Kearns crossed over and carefully\r\nexamined each window-casing and shade.\r\n\r\n“Was it through a window?” continued the King.\r\n\r\n“Possibly, Sire,” answered Kearns.\r\n\r\n“You say possibly,” exclaimed the King, somewhat petulantly, “yet\r\nhow is it possible? On the ground directly beneath those windows are\r\ntwo sentinels; on the roof directly above are two other sentinels.\r\nThe trees of the park are many feet away and from them no shot could\r\nbe fired which could possibly strike at the angle this shot struck.\r\nBesides, you see the shades are undisturbed; no bullet has passed\r\nthrough them. How do you account for all this?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll know far more by this time to-morrow, Sire,” answered Kearns\r\ncalmly, “after I’ve concluded my investigations. In the meantime, I ask\r\nthat nothing here be disturbed.”\r\n\r\n“And you will speak then to-morrow?” exclaimed the King eagerly.\r\n\r\n“It was agreed, Sire,” said Kearns, with dignity, “in order to ensure\r\nmy usual success, that I should be permitted to pursue my usual\r\nmethods. I’ll speak, Sire, at my usual time.”\r\n\r\n“Speak at your usual time!” repeated the King, apparently somewhat\r\nbewildered. “And when is that?”\r\n\r\nKearns touched the foot of the prostrate dog lightly with his own.\r\n\r\n“When,” he answered with cold determination, “when I hold the assassins\r\nwithin my net--securely within my grasp!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTERPLOT\r\n\r\n\r\n“Tell me, Professor,” said Kearns to Dean at fourteen o’clock on the\r\nfollowing day, “I’ve reason to believe I’ll need you badly in clearing\r\nup matters here. Will you help me?”\r\n\r\n“I’m a little hurt at the question,” replied the Professor. “I should\r\nhave hoped you would have taken the answer as a matter of course. How\r\nlong will you need me? I’m at your service regardless of the length of\r\ntime; but I ask because the last thing General Mainwarren did before\r\nleaving for Pennsylvania this morning was to request me to communicate\r\nwith him speedily regarding the offer which he made me.”\r\n\r\n“How long shall I need you?” repeated Kearns reflectively. “I can’t\r\nsay. That depends, I imagine, largely upon you.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” answered Professor Dean, “General Mainwarren will have to\r\nwait. Suppose you begin by telling me how I can be of use to you.”\r\n\r\n“I have already explained to you the nature of the case,” said Kearns.\r\n“I had another interview with His Nibs--that is--ah--His Majesty, I\r\nmean--this morning, but it did not result in my ascertaining anything\r\nof value beyond that which I already knew.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!” commented the Professor.\r\n\r\n“No. It seems,” continued Kearns, “that after returning from the ball,\r\nthe King immediately disrobed, retired, and was soon sound asleep. He\r\nwas awakened by a sharp bark from the dog and sprang up just in time to\r\nsee the animal fall in its death agony. At the same moment he noticed\r\nthe flutter of the white paper on the floor.”\r\n\r\n“Was there no sound of a shot--no smoke?” asked the Professor.\r\n\r\n“No,” answered Kearns, “but there’s nothing wonderful in that, because\r\nI’ve found that to-day there exists not only a smokeless powder, but\r\nalso one that’s noiseless. Moreover, they have powerful compressed-air\r\nguns from which such a shot could have been noiselessly fired.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so,” assented the Professor. “And what is your theory as to how\r\nthat paper came there?”\r\n\r\n“Gently, Professor,” exclaimed Kearns. “Let’s take up matters in\r\ntheir regular order. We’ll put off the discussion of that point for\r\nthe moment. I’ve told you what the paper contained. It was simply a\r\nwarning, accompanied by the threat that the next warning received would\r\nbe the last. It was a brief document compared to others the King has\r\nreceived.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!”\r\n\r\n“Yes; the visit of last night was the fourth. Upon the first occasion,\r\nthe King found beside his couch a lengthy document embodying demands\r\nand threats.”\r\n\r\n“And what was the nature of these demands?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, they were quite lengthy and detailed,” answered Kearns, “and were\r\nin the nature of demands that he should bring about certain industrial\r\nand economic changes, after which he was to abdicate and restore the\r\ncountry to a Republic, with either a President elected for a term\r\nof years, or at most a life President. Failing to comply with these\r\ndemands, he was threatened with death as a usurper and an enemy of the\r\npeople.”\r\n\r\n“From whom is this document supposed to have emanated?” asked Professor\r\nDean.\r\n\r\n“To find that out,” answered Kearns, “is the very mission upon which I\r\nam employed. I’ve learned that there exists, as might be expected, a\r\nstrong body among the people who are opposed to the new order of things\r\nand want to restore the Republic upon substantially its original lines.\r\nThey are what we would call revolutionists, but the term given to them\r\nat the Court is ‘Reactionists.’ They are a secret body, much like the\r\nNihilists of Russia, and all efforts to discover and uproot them have\r\nso far proved unavailing. Here and there certain conspiracies have been\r\nfrom time to time unearthed and the conspirators either executed or\r\nimprisoned, under High Treason laws which are now in full force. The\r\ncaptured men have always suffered like martyrs and have gone to their\r\ndoom resisting all temptations to make disclosures. It’s known that the\r\nReactionists are divided into bodies governed by presidents and that\r\nover them all is one supreme, able and powerful head known as the High\r\nPresident. Beyond this, practically nothing has been discovered by the\r\nspies of the King.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve raised a very serious question,” said the Professor gravely.\r\n“As true Americans, with whom ought our lot to be cast? With the\r\nmonarchy, or with these--these Reactionists?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve thought of that,” answered Kearns, “but what are we to do?\r\nWe’ve tumbled into this state of affairs, and it seems to me we\r\nmust take things as we find them. The monarchy to us is a visible\r\nand tangible fact, whereas if we started out to-morrow to find the\r\nReactionists we wouldn’t know where to look for them, nor whether they\r\nwould want anything to do with us if we found them. Remember, too,\r\nthat here we are, pitchforked into this new world, without visible\r\nmeans of support, and the first thing for a man to do is to find a\r\nsphere of occupation and employment. I’m retained to make certain\r\ndiscoveries in my particular line of professional usefulness. I’m\r\nlike a scientist employed to analyze the contents of a particular\r\nstomach, or an advocate retained to present a certain line of facts\r\nfavorable to a given side. I disclose the results of that analysis,\r\nor I present that particular line of facts regardless of those who\r\nmay be affected thereby. It’s strictly in the line of my professional\r\nactivity--entirely within the scope of my professional work and\r\nentirely conventional and proper. It doesn’t seem to me that it would\r\nbe wise, though, for us to plunge into the troubled sea of politics--at\r\nleast for the present.”\r\n\r\n“There is much truth in what you say,” replied the Professor. “Such\r\ndiscussion is, I suppose, fruitless. What more did you discover?”\r\n\r\n“First let me ask you a few questions,” retorted Kearns. “How about\r\nthat steering balloon--that air-ship--of yours? How near was it to\r\ncompletion when you went to sleep?”\r\n\r\n“My air-ship!” repeated the Professor with astonishment. “The\r\ninvention, as far as related to all the main points of discovery, was\r\npractically completed at the time this misfortune befell us.”\r\n\r\n“Misfortune!” repeated Kearns. “I really don’t know whether that’s the\r\nright way to put it. Remember if it hadn’t been for that misfortune,\r\nyou and I would be shades, playing harps upon some damp cloud, for\r\nperhaps the last quarter of a century. A live scientist is worth a\r\ndozen dead geniuses any time. However, never mind about that. Let’s\r\ncome back to the balloon.”\r\n\r\n“The air-ship!” corrected the Professor.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, the air-ship,” continued Kearns. “Tell me about it.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” exclaimed the Professor with enthusiasm, “that involves quite an\r\nexplanation on the subject of aëro-mechanics.”\r\n\r\n“Is it like a balloon?” questioned Kearns.\r\n\r\n“My dear sir,” exclaimed the Professor, “my air-ship differs as much\r\nfrom a balloon as a modern steamship from a mediæval caravel. Drifting\r\naimlessly about between earth and sky in a balloon at the mercy of the\r\nair currents is one thing; to travel rapidly through space and navigate\r\nthe air at will is an entirely different proposition. This latter is\r\nwhat my air-ship does.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!”\r\n\r\n“Yes; not only are you enabled in my air-ship,” continued the\r\nProfessor, “to travel through space at a rate of speed exceeding\r\nthat of the fastest steam engines of our time, but you can navigate\r\nabsolutely at will. The motive power is stored electricity, joined\r\nto a new force which I discovered, and which is one of the important\r\nfeatures of my invention. I’ll not touch upon the suspensory power,”\r\ncontinued the Professor, launching forth upon his theme with the\r\nenthusiasm of the scientist, “for that is too simple. Let me explain\r\nto you the combined motor and atmospheric counter resistant forces by\r\nwhich the aërial guidance is ensured. Imagine a central turret--we\r\nowe the basic invention on this point to the distinguished scientist\r\nRoowalter--a central turret, I say, furnished with powerful concentric\r\nscrews connected with a number of lateral phalanxes, or----”\r\n\r\n“Merciful powers, Professor!” cried Kearns, “you make my head swim.\r\nWhy, man alive, you might as well explain all this to a stone wall as\r\nto me, for all I understand of it. Your thing floats and travels fast\r\nand can be steered, eh?”\r\n\r\n“Precisely,” answered the Professor indulgently.\r\n\r\n“And how big is it?”\r\n\r\n“You can build it any size you please,” replied the Professor. “It can\r\nbe built so large as to----”\r\n\r\n“What is the smallest practical size?”\r\n\r\n“About as small as an ordinary row-boat, only somewhat deeper and more\r\npointed at the prow.”\r\n\r\n“It can be made to stand absolutely still in space?” continued Kearns.\r\n\r\n“Again, I will compare it to a row-boat,” replied the Professor.\r\n“If the motor power be shut off it will remain practically still,\r\ndrifting more or less lightly in the air currents, just as a row-boat,\r\nunpropelled by the oars, drifts in the water according as the currents\r\nare more or less strong.”\r\n\r\n“But suppose you could grapple with an anchor or other attachment, to\r\nthe trunk of a tree, or the side of some structure, would it take much\r\nforce to hold your machine perfectly still?” questioned Kearns.\r\n\r\n“Very little,” answered the Professor, “in fact, I can again best\r\nillustrate by suggesting a row-boat held steady by a boat-hook.”\r\n\r\n“Just so,” answered Kearns slowly and with a thoughtful air; “I think I\r\nunderstand. And how long,” he continued, after a moment’s reflection,\r\n“would it take you to build a machine of this character?”\r\n\r\n“Of what size?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, the smallest size.”\r\n\r\n“That would depend,” answered the Professor, “upon the facilities at\r\nmy command. Given a shop fully and efficiently equipped, I could turn\r\nout my air-ship in a remarkably short time. Like most good things, it\r\npresents the merit of much simplicity after once the right principles\r\nhave been discovered. You see----”\r\n\r\n“What do you call a short time,” interrupted Kearns, “assuming you had\r\nthe highest facilities?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I wouldn’t like to specify exactly----”\r\n\r\n“Tell me,” broke in Kearns impetuously; “would it be a day--a month--a\r\nyear?”\r\n\r\n“Since you insist,” replied the Professor, “under pressure and assuming\r\nthat I was furnished with the highest facilities, my invention is so\r\nwell advanced and the practical details are so clearly outlined in my\r\nmind that I could produce an air-ship of the smaller type in from two\r\nto three weeks.”\r\n\r\nKearns sprang forward with a joyous exclamation.\r\n\r\n“Professor,” he cried, “you shall build that machine. You shall have\r\nthe highest facilities--the very highest facilities--I promise you, but\r\nit must be ready within a month at latest!”\r\n\r\n“Why--why--what do you mean?” exclaimed the Professor with mingled joy\r\nand astonishment.\r\n\r\n“Never mind!” retorted Kearns. “Suffice it that the King will refuse me\r\nnothing I need to assist me in my investigations. And now, I have one\r\nother question to ask. Does your machine leak at times?”\r\n\r\n“Leak!” repeated the Professor, bewildered.\r\n\r\n“Well, I mean,” explained Kearns, “does it ever exude, drop, drip, let\r\nfall--or whatever you like to call it--a liquid of any kind?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I see what you mean!” exclaimed the Professor, his face lighting\r\nup. “Why, yes. To the right side and below the level of the main\r\nturret, there is a secondary storage box. The decomposition of the\r\nchemicals in this box produces the power to----”\r\n\r\n“Now, Professor,” interrupted Kearns, “please don’t wax technical.\r\nRemember, as I told you, a stone wall is a light and airy thing\r\ncompared to my density as to matters mechanical.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, O marvel of density!” retorted the Professor with light\r\nsarcasm; “I will endeavor to explain so that even your benighted brain\r\nmay grasp and understand. What would you do if you had a grate full of\r\ncoals and the coals had burned out and you wanted more fire?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” replied Kearns mischievously, “that I should ring the bell\r\nand tell the servant to make up the fire.”\r\n\r\n“And how would the servant do it?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose by putting on more coals,” answered Kearns cautiously.\r\n\r\n“Indeed!” sniffed the Professor contemptuously, “does it not occur to\r\nyou--O man of self-vaunted thickness!--that the servant might indulge\r\nin some operation prior to putting on those fresh coals?”\r\n\r\n“Huh!” exclaimed Kearns, with a puzzled expression; “I suppose you mean\r\nthat there would first be a raking out of the ashes.”\r\n\r\n“Good!” exclaimed the Professor; “you are beginning to betray an\r\nintelligence which is almost human. Now, so it is in the case of the\r\nair-ship. In that secondary storage box to which I have referred\r\nare certain chemicals which furnish power. When a portion of these\r\nchemicals have exhausted their activity, a residuum gradually forms,\r\ncorresponding to the ashes in your grate, only it is in liquid form\r\ninstead of solid. This residuum is allowed to escape through a valve\r\nand is thus carried away and, of course, the storage box is fed\r\nfrom time to time, as may be required, with fresh energy-producing\r\nchemicals.”\r\n\r\n“Let me see if I understand it,” persisted Kearns with obstinacy. “This\r\nliquid residuum, as you call it, leaks away through the bottom of the\r\nair-ship, doesn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“You may put it that way,” said the Professor, smiling.\r\n\r\n“And that blamed old dripping liquid residuum would either burn into,\r\nor else make a deep brown stain upon any fairly soft material it\r\ntouched, wouldn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” exclaimed the Professor excitedly; “a dark brown stain. But\r\nhow--how did you know this?”\r\n\r\n“Not bad, eh?” retorted Kearns, “for a marvel of density! In course of\r\ntime--O sage of a century of Wisdom!--and under your able direction,\r\nyou’ll find that almost human intelligence of mine gradually developing\r\nitself.”\r\n\r\n“But how did you know this?” persisted the Professor.\r\n\r\n“Patience! O Aged Wise Man of the decomposing chemicals, main turrets\r\nand cylindrical tubes,” retorted Kearns; “patience, I say! Didn’t I\r\ntell you that under my methods everything must come in its proper\r\norder? Listen, then, and you’ll learn.”\r\n\r\n“I’m all attention,” said the Professor.\r\n\r\n“I commenced my operations this morning,” began Kearns, “by making a\r\nthorough examination of the _locus_. I’ll not weary you with a long\r\ndescription of the preliminary details of my investigation--how I\r\nextracted and took possession of the bullet which had been fired and\r\nthoroughly examined the apartment, its surroundings--everything.”\r\n\r\n“I think we may trust you for that,” remarked the Professor, with a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n“The King’s sleeping apartment,” continued Kearns, “is in the extreme\r\nwestern wing of the palace. It is a spacious apartment, with two\r\nalcoves. One of these alcoves contains the royal couch; the other,\r\nthe royal bath. There are four windows and two doors. One of these\r\ndoors--that leading out on the passage--is securely sealed from the\r\ninside; the other leads into the antechamber. In this antechamber there\r\nis on duty every night a Captain of the Guard, and the outer corridor\r\nis watched by three sentinels. At the extreme end of the corridor is\r\nanother apartment also at the disposal of the Captain of the Guard.\r\nShould anyone appear at the end of the corridor, the sentinel would\r\nsignal to his comrade, who would in turn signal to the third sentinel\r\nand the officer on duty would come forth and receive the visitor in the\r\napartment at the extreme end of the corridor. This is done to prevent\r\nany sound in the antechamber disturbing the King.”\r\n\r\n“Quite elaborate precautions, I see,” commented the Professor.\r\n\r\n“Just so,” resumed Kearns. “Now, last night, Captain Bingham, of the\r\nGuard, was on duty and I’m satisfied from what he tells me that no\r\none visited the corridor after the King had retired. In fact, nothing\r\nhappened until the sharp ring of the electric signal in the King’s\r\nchamber caused Captain Bingham to rush in and we know what he found\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” assented the Professor.\r\n\r\n“I said I wouldn’t weary you by going into unnecessary details,”\r\ncontinued Kearns, “so I’ll omit the further investigations pursued by\r\nme and come to the point at once by telling you that I’m satisfied that\r\nno attack came from either the corridor or the antechamber. It came\r\nfrom without.”\r\n\r\n“From the windows?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly. There are four windows to the apartment. Two of these were\r\nclosed last night and two open. All were shaded by heavy blinds\r\nwhich had been drawn fully down. The windows are forty-five feet from\r\nthe ground and fifty-five feet below the palace roof. The grounds\r\nimmediately beneath are patrolled by two sentinels, and on the roof\r\nimmediately above are two other sentinels. The windows look out upon\r\nthe park and the nearest tree to any of the four windows is sixty-five\r\nfeet away.”\r\n\r\n“It would seem a safe enough retreat and one certainly very difficult\r\nof approach by an enemy,” remarked the Professor.\r\n\r\n“And yet,” replied Kearns, “that was the point from which the attack\r\ncame. The King is extremely fond of air. He experiences a sense\r\nof suffocation whenever he is closed in an apartment which is not\r\nsufficiently airy. Confident in the sentinels above and below and in\r\nthe inaccessibility of his chamber, it has been his custom to sleep\r\nwith two of the windows open. I examined these windows carefully,\r\ninside and out. I discovered only one thing. It was not much and\r\nyet--yet--I think it means something.”\r\n\r\n“What was it?” inquired the Professor eagerly.\r\n\r\n“On the under side of the stone ledge under one of the windows, I\r\ndiscovered three sharp scratches and four small but rather deep\r\nindentations.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! is that all?” exclaimed the Professor with an air of\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\n“That was all,” replied Kearns calmly, “yet to me it means something.”\r\n\r\n“What do you think?”\r\n\r\n“That by gripping onto the under part of that window ledge, something\r\nwas held in place there--moored, if you so like to call it.”\r\n\r\n“I fail to follow you,” remarked the Professor.\r\n\r\n“Very well, then,” said Kearns, “if that’s the case, we’ll leave the\r\nwindow and maybe you can follow me into the grounds. But before doing\r\nthat, let me tell you one other fact I discovered. It was this: I\r\ninquired into the exact dates on which the three previous attacks had\r\ntaken place and made another little discovery.”\r\n\r\n“What was it?”\r\n\r\n“Was there any moon last night?” asked Kearns, suddenly breaking off.\r\n\r\n“No,” answered the Professor, after a moment’s reflection; “the last\r\nquarter went out three nights ago.”\r\n\r\n“And last night was quite a dark night, wasn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the Professor; “slightly hazy and overcast.”\r\n\r\n“Any heavy wind?”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered the Professor.\r\n\r\n“Just so,” continued Kearns, “and it was the same on the occasions of\r\nthe other three attacks. I’ve consulted the weather records and in each\r\ncase found a night following shortly after the wane of the moon’s last\r\nquarter--a dark, starless night, with light winds. Do you begin to\r\nscent an African in the woodpile?”\r\n\r\n“I fear I must have a cold,” retorted the Professor, “for so far my\r\nsense of smell detects nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” answered Kearns, “follow me into the grounds. I carefully\r\nexamined the trees there--not merely the trunks, but also the tops.\r\nAnd among the leaves and branches of some of the tops I discovered\r\nsomething more.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“That a number--quite a large number--of the leaves had great blotches\r\nwhere they had been eaten away and a number of the twigs and boughs\r\nhad big brown splashes. I followed these marks in a westerly direction\r\nuntil I came to the river. There I lost them and all efforts failed to\r\ndiscover where they resumed on the bank. Now, do you begin to discover\r\nanything?”\r\n\r\n“Speak out,” cried the Professor in ill-restrained excitement; “say\r\nwhat you mean!”\r\n\r\n“I’ll endeavor to make it plain to your intelligence, O man of\r\nself-convicted density!” retorted Kearns triumphantly. “What do you\r\nthink was the something which could come, in dead of night, under\r\nthe window, forty-five feet above the ground, and be unseen by the\r\nsentinels above and below; the something which put a mark upon the\r\nstone ledge as if it had been moored there by the sharp prongs of a\r\nboat-hook; the something that leaves behind it burns and dark brown\r\nstains upon the leaves and branches of the trees?”\r\n\r\n“What--what--can be the meaning of this?” stammered the Professor, his\r\nface working with excitement.\r\n\r\n“That there are,” rejoined Kearns, “other distinguished scientists and\r\ninventors besides Professor Dean--that the work he dropped fifty years\r\nago has been taken up by others and secretly perfected.”\r\n\r\n“An air-ship--an air-ship!” gasped the Professor.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” retorted Kearns, “yes, O man of cranks and cog-wheels, an\r\nair-ship. An air-ship coming on dark and windless nights, between\r\nmoons, passing unseen the sentinels on turret and in grounds, and\r\nmooring under the windows of the King to deliver its attack. So will it\r\ncome again! And it is with an air-ship, designed and built by you, that\r\nwe must and can alone meet the attack.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE EAVESDROPPER OF THE QUEEN’S WALK\r\n\r\n\r\n“Say, Dorothy!” cried Beatrice Cuming, sweeping into Miss Brandon’s\r\napartment with the energy and enthusiasm of a miniature cyclone; “I’m\r\nso glad to catch you alone--so glad! I was afraid somebody would be\r\nhere and I wouldn’t have a chance to talk to you right away.”\r\n\r\nDorothy shifted her fair head from its position on the cushions of her\r\neasy-chair and turned her blue eyes upon the speaker.\r\n\r\n“Why, what has happened, Trixy?” she asked with languid interest. “It\r\nmust, of course, be something of much importance, considering it’s\r\nalmost an hour since you left me.”\r\n\r\n“An hour!” exclaimed Beatrice; “let me tell you, a whole catalogue of\r\nwonderful things can happen in an hour. And so it is here. I’ve a whole\r\nbookful to tell you--a romance--a love affair--a tragedy!”\r\n\r\n“Your introduction is certainly promising, Trixy, dear,” remarked\r\nDorothy with the same languid interest, “but it’s rather lengthy.\r\nRemember, long introductions to romances have been out of fashion since\r\nthe days of our great-grandmothers. Wouldn’t it be well to begin your\r\nstory?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know just how to begin it,” answered Beatrice ingenuously,\r\n“it’s so interesting. But,” she added suddenly, “you’re quite sure you\r\nmeant what you told me the other day?”\r\n\r\n“Told you the other day?” inquired Dorothy, puzzled; “told you about\r\nwhat?”\r\n\r\n“About your not caring anything for him, of course?”\r\n\r\n“And who may ‘_him_’ be?” asked Dorothy, with an ever so slight change\r\nof voice.\r\n\r\n“Why, Captain Mortimer, of course!”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” exclaimed Dorothy, her face flushing slightly, “of course not.\r\nHow silly you are, Trixy!”\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied Beatrice, “I thought I’d make quite sure, you know.\r\nDear old papa says I’m always blundering into things without first\r\nmaking proper inquiry, so I thought I’d make quite sure in this case. I\r\nwonder who it can be, though?”\r\n\r\n“Who what can be?”\r\n\r\n“Never mind!” retorted Beatrice; “listen to my story first, and we can\r\nthen put our heads together and try to guess who the _she_ is.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” exclaimed Dorothy, slightly arching her eyebrows, “you have\r\nreally decided to begin, then?”\r\n\r\n“Stop, Dorothy,” protested Beatrice, “don’t tease me! You’ll drive\r\nsome of it out of my head and I don’t want to forget anything. Let me\r\nsee; where shall I begin? Oh, yes! Well; after I left you I went for\r\na stroll in the park. It was such a beautiful day; the smell of the\r\nflowers and the grasses was so sweet that I kept on and on almost to\r\nthe end of the Queen’s Walk. Presently I felt tired and looked about me\r\nfor a place to rest. I saw a seat some little distance away and I kept\r\non until I reached it and there I sat down. Do you follow me, Dorothy?”\r\n\r\n“I find no difficulty in doing so thus far, Trixy,” answered Dorothy,\r\nwith a smile. “Consider that I’ve followed you to the seat at the end\r\nof the Queen’s Walk.”\r\n\r\n“I hadn’t been there more than a few minutes,” resumed Beatrice, “when\r\nI noticed, around a bend in the path, two officers approaching. Who do\r\nyou think they were?”\r\n\r\n“Remember, Trixy,” answered Dorothy, “you are supposed to be telling a\r\nstory--not propounding riddles!”\r\n\r\n“Why, Captain Swords and Captain Mortimer, Dorothy!”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!” remarked Dorothy very quietly.\r\n\r\n“Yes. They were talking together and they didn’t see me. What do you\r\nthink I did, Dorothy?”\r\n\r\n“Now you are asking a riddle, Trixy,” replied Dorothy. “You waited\r\nuntil they came up, I suppose, and then monopolized their attention\r\nduring the rest of the promenade!”\r\n\r\n“All wrong--all wrong!” cried Beatrice gayly; “nothing of the kind!\r\nRight back of my seat was a big tree, or bush--as high as this room and\r\nhalf as big around. Watching them closely and being quite sure they\r\nhadn’t seen me, I crept around to the back of that bush and hid.”\r\n\r\n“Hid!” exclaimed Dorothy in astonishment; “why, what was your object in\r\ndoing that?”\r\n\r\n“Just this,” said Beatrice, with a merry laugh; “I thought they might\r\ntake the seat I had left and, if they did, what fun it would be to\r\ncreep up behind them and drop a few grains of gravel down the collar of\r\nRalph’s uniform.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, the idea!” exclaimed Dorothy, with a shocked air. “And, Trixy,”\r\nseverely, “since when have you taken to calling the officers of the\r\nGuard by their first names?”\r\n\r\n“Captain Swords, I should say, of course,” replied Beatrice, not in the\r\nleast abashed; “but he’s so jolly and all his brother officers call him\r\nRalph. It seems so much easier to call him that. What a brave fellow\r\nhe must be, too! Captain Bingham was telling me how he--Ral--Captain\r\nSwords, I mean--rode out to retake the abandoned guns at Vladivik and\r\nhow he was wounded. Oh, I just thrilled as I listened to that story.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” exclaimed Dorothy, apparently catching Beatrice’s enthusiasm,\r\n“but Captain Mortimer was there, too. It was he, after all, who brought\r\nin the guns and, though wounded, carried Captain Swords from under the\r\nRussian fire.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; and Ralph--Captain Swords, I mean--was decorated with the\r\nColumbia Cross,” said Beatrice.\r\n\r\n“So was Captain Mortimer,” replied Dorothy, “besides receiving mention\r\nin General Orders. But,” she added hastily, “are we going to discuss\r\nthe Russian War, dear, or are you going on with your story?”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure it must have been you who interrupted me, dear,” rejoined\r\nBeatrice imperturbably. “Let me see, where was I? Oh, yes! I had\r\nhidden behind the big bush. Well, on they came and, sure enough, they\r\nseated themselves at the very place I had just left. For a while they\r\nsat there quite still. Neither of them said anything and from my\r\nhiding-place I could smell the smoke of their cigars. I was trying to\r\nfind some gravel, but I couldn’t discover any behind the bush, so I was\r\nstooping down looking for some pebbles of the right size, when suddenly\r\nCaptain Swords’ voice came to me. ‘Stanley, old fellow,’ he said,\r\n‘there’s been something wrong with you the last few days. Won’t you\r\nspeak out and tell me what’s the matter? Usually there are no secrets\r\nbetween us.’\r\n\r\n“It seemed to me a long time before the other made any reply, but at\r\nlast his voice came to me.\r\n\r\n“‘Ralph,’ he said, ‘I want to get out of this--to get away from here.\r\nI’ve made up my mind to leave the Guard and exchange into the Tenth, or\r\nsome other regiment.’\r\n\r\n“‘You astonish me, Stanley,’ replied Captain Swords; ‘for I thought it\r\nwas rather jolly here and that you found it so, too. But, be that as it\r\nmay, if you want to exchange, then exchange let it be for both of us.\r\nJust say the word--when?’\r\n\r\n“‘What! You’ll leave the Imperial Guard, too?’ the other exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“‘Yes,’ said Captain Swords, ‘we’ve always been together. Whenever you\r\ngo, I go with you. Still, I’d like to know just what has put you out of\r\nsorts with things here.’\r\n\r\n“Again there was a long pause before there came an answer. I was\r\npuzzling just what I ought to do--whether to come out and announce\r\nmyself, or stay quietly where I was. You see, having unintentionally\r\nlistened so far, I was embarrassed and didn’t know quite what to do.\r\nBefore I could make up my mind, Captain Mortimer again spoke.\r\n\r\n“‘Ralph,’ he said, ‘I’ll be quite frank with you. Before I came to this\r\ncursed Court, my experiences with women had been the ordinary ones of\r\na soldier. I hadn’t been here a week, though, before I met one who\r\nappealed to me as no other woman ever had. No need for me to name her.\r\nYou know whom I mean.’\r\n\r\n“‘The women here do seem to have a decidedly queer effect upon a man,’\r\nanswered Captain Swords. ‘I have noticed that. But I didn’t mean to\r\ninterrupt. Go on, Stanley.’\r\n\r\n“‘Ralph,’ said the other one, and his voice seemed to me to shake\r\nas he spoke, ‘I’m an infernal fool. I loved that woman--loved her\r\npassionately, reverently, madly. Her presence, her voice, her touch\r\nseemed to open the gates of heaven to me--the world was different from\r\nwhat it ever had looked to me before. It was heaven and yet there was a\r\nhell in it, too. Ralph, I tell you, man, if you’d be happy, never love\r\na woman like that.’\r\n\r\n“‘Poor old fellow!’ said Captain Swords.”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, Trixy, dear,” exclaimed Dorothy, suddenly wheeling her\r\nchair, “but the light hurts me. You won’t mind my turning this way,\r\nwill you? No, dear, don’t move. I like your voice to come to me that\r\nway--from behind me. I’m listening. Continue.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, let me see where I was,” resumed Beatrice. “Oh, yes;\r\nCaptain Swords said: ‘Poor old fellow!’ and then the other continued:\r\n\r\n“‘I told you, Ralph, that I was an infernal fool and that’s putting\r\nit mildly. I loved her and I was fool enough for a brief, mad period\r\nto hope--to believe--that she loved me. Lady Brooke happened to speak\r\nher name one night and incidentally mentioned a few details concerning\r\nher. Lady Brooke said she was a favorite with the Queen and that she\r\nwas considered to be one of the richest heiresses of the Court. As she\r\nsaid the words, Ralph, I went sick all through me. I felt as when that\r\nRussian bullet hit me at Pedershof, for I had known nothing of this and\r\nhere, it seemed, was an unexpected barrier between us. Lady Brooke,\r\nhowever, went on to say--and she warned me that this was strictly\r\nconfidential, of course--that this report, like many other reports,\r\nhad little foundation in fact; that in reality the lady’s money was\r\nlargely in expectancy as the heiress of her maternal uncle, Sir Ray\r\nMurray, the head of the Copper Trust; that Sir Ray was engaged in a\r\nwar to the death with Sir Brussels Page and that the whole thing might\r\nresult in Sir Ray’s financial annihilation, in which case the lady’s\r\nsupposed millions would dwindle to nothing. It seems a strange, I might\r\nsay almost a mean thing, Ralph, to rejoice at some form of ill-fortune\r\ntouching the woman you adore, but the truth is the truth--I did rejoice\r\nat those words of Lady Brooke. Those millions would have been a barrier\r\nbetween us. Without them, I felt she was nearer to me. Lady Brooke is\r\na handsome woman--although I never particularly took to her--but she\r\nnever looked so handsome to me as at that moment. I could have laughed\r\nout--laughed out loud and long--as she spoke pityingly of the almost\r\ncertain loss of those confounded millions. Just as if the man who wins\r\nher for her own sweet sake alone will not be richer than the royal heir\r\nwho comes to his throne.’”\r\n\r\n“He said that--he said that! You heard him say that?” murmured Dorothy,\r\nfrom her chair, in a strangely muffled voice.\r\n\r\n“Yes; of course that’s what he said,” replied Beatrice, engrossed in\r\nher story. “Am I not giving you the exact words?”\r\n\r\n“Go on--go on.”\r\n\r\n“There now! You’ve thrown me all out by interrupting and I’ve lost the\r\nthread.”\r\n\r\n“Please forgive me. What did they say next?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” resumed Beatrice, “Captain Swords asked him why he had given up\r\nhope. Why was it that he thought the lady didn’t care for him?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; yes!”\r\n\r\n“Then the other answered him this way: ‘Ralph, it’s all over. I’m just\r\nas much a “goner” as a solitary picket cut off and surrounded by a\r\nsotnia of Cossacks. You remember, Ralph, the night of the ball--the\r\nlast one. I danced twice with her that night and twice, as we danced,\r\nshe looked into my eyes and I could have sworn I saw the love-light\r\nthere. I was encouraged, Ralph--buoyed up by my fool hopes and went\r\nblindly on to the awful ambuscade that lay for me at the end of this\r\nlover’s lane I was treading. After the second dance, I walked with her\r\nin the great conservatory and there, my brain whirling, I told her--I\r\ndon’t know what!’”\r\n\r\n“‘And she refused you?’ Captain Swords asked.\r\n\r\n“‘Refused me!’ the other answered, oh! so sadly; ‘well, she listened\r\nto the end and then gave a little laugh, treated it all as a mere\r\njest--a nothing--murmured some words which I was too dazed even to\r\nunderstand--and left me hastily to join her partner for the next dance.’\r\n\r\n“‘The cursed coquette!’ I heard Captain Swords say savagely.\r\n\r\n“Then the other turned upon Captain Swords fiercely and declared that\r\nhe wouldn’t hear one word of reproach spoken of her in his presence;\r\nthat whatever she had done was, beyond question, right; no doubt that\r\nwas the way of the ladies of the Court, and if rough soldiers, who had\r\nspent their lives in camp and field, didn’t properly understand those\r\nways, it was their fault and they ought not to complain.”\r\n\r\n“How noble--how generous!” came from the figure in the chair.\r\n\r\n“Wasn’t it, Dorothy!” continued Beatrice; “but that’s not all. He said\r\nthat after the lady had refused him, he remained in the conservatory\r\nfor some time and then, not very well knowing what he was doing, he\r\nwandered back to the ball-room to catch another glimpse of her as she\r\ndanced with that black-looking devil, Lord Ashley, as he called him.\r\nThen he went on to say that as he stood there, Lady Brooke came up and\r\nbegan to talk to him. She drew his attention to the lady and asked him\r\nif she and Lord Ashley didn’t make a handsome couple--she so light and\r\nhe so dark. Lady Brooke said that she thought there would surely be a\r\nmatch, as she had been playing her cards to win Lord Ashley because of\r\nhis title, and a titled husband was the one thing above everything that\r\nthe lady had set her heart on.”\r\n\r\n“She said that--she said that to him!” cried Dorothy, suddenly sitting\r\nupright in her chair.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes; that’s what she said and more too. She went on to tell him\r\nthat she thought the lady would very likely succeed and would become\r\nLady Ashley, as she was a clever and skilful angler, but did he not\r\nthink that she angled for him a little too openly and too boldly?”\r\n\r\n“Oh--oh! What----”\r\n\r\n“Now don’t interrupt me, Dorothy,” exclaimed Beatrice, completely\r\nengrossed in her story, “or I’ll lose it all again. Well, when Lady\r\nBrooke said that to him the one wish in his mind, he said, was that she\r\nwere a man and he would have strangled her where she stood for those\r\nwords she had spoken.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and then he went on to say that whomever she chose--whether lord\r\nor commoner--would be fortunate, indeed, and that he hoped she would be\r\nas happy as he knew she was good and beautiful. Then he told Captain\r\nSwords that he should always love her, with the loyalty a soldier has\r\nfor his flag; worship her with the blind idolatry of a fanatic for his\r\nGod. He said that if war should again break out, it would find him at\r\nthe front and that when he fell his one hope was that her face might be\r\nthe last vision to pass before his eyes; her name the last word upon\r\nhis lips. Oh, Dorothy, I tell you he spoke so beautifully and so sadly\r\nof her that I just sniveled behind the bush and the sob I gave nearly\r\nbetrayed me. As for Captain Swords, I could hear him pacing up and\r\ndown the path and he flung his cigar away with such violence that it\r\nflew clear over the big bush and almost fell on my head. I wish I had\r\nsomeone to care for me like that. As for Lady Brooke----”\r\n\r\nAt the mention of that name, Dorothy suddenly sprang from her chair and\r\nconfronted Beatrice with pale face and strained, wide-staring eyes.\r\n\r\n“The wretch--oh, the wretch!” she murmured fiercely. “Such base\r\nfalsehood!”\r\n\r\n“Why, Dorothy,” exclaimed Beatrice, startled, “why are you so excited?”\r\n\r\n“Excited! Who wouldn’t be in the face of such horrible untruths--such a\r\ndreadful mistake!”\r\n\r\n“Why, why, Dorothy!” cried Beatrice quickly. “Do you know anything of\r\nthis? Who the lady is? Is she some friend of yours? Have I made you\r\nunhappy?”\r\n\r\nDorothy took a step forward and put her arms around Beatrice.\r\n\r\n“Unhappy!” she stammered; “oh, I’m wretched--so wretched. No, no; I\r\nmean I’m happy--so very happy. You don’t understand.”\r\n\r\nBut Beatrice released herself and looked anxiously into her friend’s\r\nface.\r\n\r\n“What has happened, Dorothy?” she inquired with concern. “You are ill!\r\nYou are all white and red by turns.”\r\n\r\n“No, no; you don’t understand!”\r\n\r\n“Understand, eh!” quoth Beatrice, the light of a sudden intelligence\r\ncoming into her eyes. “Oh! I see--I see. There now! Just to think of\r\nit! As papa would say, I’ve been blundering again.”\r\n\r\n“See! You see what?”\r\n\r\n“But you distinctly told me,” came the somewhat irrelevant answer,\r\n“that you didn’t care for him!”\r\n\r\n“Why, of course--of course not; you silly, silly goose! You don’t\r\nunderstand--you don’t understand----”\r\n\r\nAnd by way of adding to Beatrice’s comprehension of the situation,\r\nDorothy suddenly drew her to her heart, sank her head upon her\r\nshoulder, and, with great broken sobs following fast upon one another,\r\nwept as if her heart would break.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE TAP OF MILADI’S FAN\r\n\r\n\r\n“Do you think _it_ will surely come? Are you confident that this entire\r\nhypothesis of yours is correctly grounded?” and Professor Dean peered\r\nwith wistful anxiety into Kearns’ face.\r\n\r\nThat personage stared silently for a moment into the Professor’s\r\ninquiring eyes, and then answered with imperturbability:\r\n\r\n“Will ducks swim?”\r\n\r\n“I believe that according to established natural laws,” answered the\r\nProfessor acidly, “they will.”\r\n\r\n“Will this air-ship of yours fly?”\r\n\r\nThis time the Professor’s reply showed some warmth.\r\n\r\n“Hasn’t it been tested? Haven’t you seen for yourself? Aren’t you\r\nsatisfied?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“Perfectly,” conceded Kearns bluntly. “Well; just as sure as ducks\r\nswim and as your air-ship flies--and mighty high and rapid is its\r\nflight, I’ll admit--so surely will my hypothesis, as you call it, turn\r\nout scientifically correct and I’ll run my quarry to ground. I’m not\r\naccustomed to failure, you know, and I certainly can’t afford to fail\r\nin this case. Didn’t the warning say that the next will be the last?\r\nThat means, I take it, there is going to be at least one more warning\r\nand, judging from past success, they’ll adopt the same means and the\r\nsame methods as before. This is just about the time when things are\r\ndue; the night, too, judging from present indications, looks as if it\r\nwould be the right kind. I’d not be astonished if this was the night!”\r\n\r\nThe conversation was held in a spacious apartment of the Summer Palace\r\nimmediately to the west of the King’s sleeping apartment, forming part\r\nof the suite in the palace assigned to the affairs of the Chancellerie.\r\nStretching across the apartment upon two rests, which brought it to a\r\nlevel with the wide bay windows, was a machine resembling in length\r\nand general contour an ordinary steam launch, but differing materially\r\nfrom a steam launch in its various accessory details. It was Professor\r\nDean’s much-prized air-ship--christened by Kearns “The Royal Dean.”\r\n\r\nThe various component parts of this air-ship had been manufactured\r\nwith much secrecy at one of the royal dockyards. The parts had then\r\nbeen forwarded to a secluded portion of the country, where a temporary\r\nworkshop had been fitted up for the Professor. There the assembling\r\nof the parts had taken place and the final and successful tests made.\r\nThanks to the careful and elaborate precautions taken, no inkling of\r\nthe nature of the work had filtered abroad. Only three of the workmen\r\nengaged on the assembling really knew that an air-ship had been turned\r\nout, and these three were very securely taken care of for the present.\r\n\r\nThe same careful and secret precautions were observed in bringing the\r\nair-ship to the Summer Palace and installing it there. At Kearns’\r\nsuggestion, the Court had abandoned the Summer Palace at the time the\r\nwork was first begun, the Queen and her suite going to Emberton, and\r\nthe King and his suite to the City Palace.\r\n\r\nAt last the work on the air-ship had been completed and that portion\r\nof the Chancellerie suite adjoining the King’s sleeping apartment had\r\nbeen given over to Kearns. There, after certain preliminary work in\r\nconnection with one of the big bay windows so as to permit of the ready\r\nexit of the air-ship, the installation had taken place.\r\n\r\nThen and not until then, Kearns gave the word and the King and Queen,\r\naccompanied by their respective suites, returned to the Summer Palace.\r\nThis return took place while there were yet three nights left of the\r\nwaning moon--just in the nick of time, as Kearns put it.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, one matter troubling Kearns. The necessity of\r\nsecrecy and also of compactness of construction had been such that\r\nit had only been possible to construct an air-ship of very moderate\r\ndimensions--an air-ship equipped to carry only two persons. Now,\r\none of these persons must necessarily be Professor Dean, since he\r\nalone was competent to navigate the aërial craft. Who was to be the\r\nother passenger? Equally obviously--as Kearns himself was compelled\r\nregretfully to admit--it could not be Kearns. In following the\r\nattacking party, it was impossible to predict what situations might be\r\nencountered or what exigencies might arise. To cope properly with these\r\nsituations and meet these exigencies, necessarily required some person\r\nwho was familiar with existing conditions and customs, otherwise the\r\nwhole pursuit might result in failure and the marauders escape. A man\r\nwho had only recently excited the risibilities and the wonderment of\r\nrustics by inquiring for a horse and carriage was hardly the right man\r\nfor the task. Sadly and with woebegone mien, Kearns had to concede it.\r\n\r\nThe solitary passenger accompanying the Professor must be a man\r\nfamiliar with existing conditions--a man of authority, of resource\r\nand of courage. Casting about them for a selection, neither Kearns\r\nnor the Professor could think of any person possessing better\r\nqualifications for the work in hand than Captain Stanley Mortimer,\r\nof the Imperial Guard. Following upon Beatrice’s introduction and\r\nthe Captain’s invitation to visit his quarters, they had both formed\r\nhis acquaintance; he had shown them various little attentions and\r\nkindnesses; both were impressed with him.\r\n\r\nBut Captain Mortimer’s military duties as an officer of the Guard might\r\npossibly interfere with his movements on the critical night. There must\r\nalso be a substitute, in case of emergency, and naturally they selected\r\nCaptain Mortimer’s comrade, Captain Ralph Swords.\r\n\r\nReluctantly, therefore, Kearns consented and the subject was broached\r\nto the two officers, under strictest promise of secrecy. To no one must\r\nthey breathe one word of the expedition, neither before nor after the\r\nevent, until relieved from their respective promises by Mr. Kearns.\r\n\r\nBoth eagerly consented to embark upon what promised to be at least an\r\ninteresting adventure. They had contemplated leaving the Imperial Guard\r\nand exchanging into another regiment, but in view of this adventure\r\nthey decided to postpone matters.\r\n\r\nFollowing his customary methods, Kearns communicated these selections\r\nto no one--not even to the King. Mr. Kearns liked to deal only in\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the air-ship, there was a “little side invention,” as\r\nMr. Kearns termed it, which gave that gentleman much satisfaction\r\nand comfort. The Professor dubbed it “an aërestograph,” but Kearns\r\npreferred to refer to it as “the aërial telegraph.” This latter not\r\ninaptly described it. It was an instrument fastened to the end\r\nof a support some four feet in height. Supplied each with one of\r\nthese instruments, two persons many miles apart could interchange\r\nmessages, without the use of any connecting wire, provided there\r\nwere no interfering obstructions. The Professor referred to it as\r\nan exceedingly simple invention, based to some extent upon the same\r\nprinciples as those applied by Marconi, but with apparatus much\r\nsimplified. One of these instruments was mounted in the room in the\r\nChancellerie given over to Kearns; the other instrument was stored away\r\nin the air-ship. By rising in the air-ship to a sufficient altitude\r\nto clear intervening obstructions, there would thus be constant\r\npossibility of communication between the air-ship and Kearns. By means\r\nof this instrument, Kearns felt that he was at least in touch with the\r\nProfessor and the news.\r\n\r\nSo matters stood on the night of the recorded conversation between\r\nthe Professor and Kearns. The night was dark--slightly hazy and\r\novercast--corresponding in many respects, as Kearns noted with\r\njoy, to the night when the previous visitation had taken place. To\r\ncomplete further the resemblance, a ball was being held in the Summer\r\nPalace--not upon the scale of magnificence of the preceding event,\r\nbut a Court ball, nevertheless, with all the accessory brilliancy and\r\ngayety.\r\n\r\nShortly after midnight, the Professor, Kearns and Captain Mortimer sat\r\nwatching in the room of the Chancellerie assigned to them. Immediately\r\nnext to them, but separated by a solid wall, was the King’s sleeping\r\napartment, in the antechamber of which Captain Swords was on duty as\r\nOfficer of the Day.\r\n\r\nNot long after midnight a messenger handed a note to the sentinel at\r\nthe end of the corridor. It was passed on from sentinel to sentinel\r\nuntil it reached Captain Swords. It was a delicately perfumed little\r\nmissive, addressed in a large and straggling feminine handwriting. The\r\nCaptain tore it open and read:\r\n\r\n  “Captain Swords: Since you have been so inconsiderate as to be on\r\n  guard to-night, you might at least send Captain Mortimer to dance\r\n  one little waltz with me. He, too, seems to have disappeared. If you\r\n  don’t manage this little favor for me, you need never speak to me\r\n  again.\r\n\r\n                                                                  “B. C.\r\n\r\n  “P. S.--I am awfully disappointed and angry.\r\n\r\n  “P. P. S.--I may be at the entrance to the Queen’s Walk at fourteen\r\n  o’clock to-morrow, but it would be no use for you to try to meet me\r\n  there, because I should refuse to tell you anything interesting which\r\n  might have taken place at the ball.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Swords smiled as he read, afterward standing for a moment,\r\nreflecting, with the note between his fingers. With the air of a man\r\nwho has suddenly made up his mind, he left the antechamber, walked\r\nup the corridor past the King’s apartment and knocked lightly at the\r\nnearest door of the Chancellerie suite. Captain Mortimer promptly\r\nresponded to the summons and a brief whispered conference took place\r\nbetween them. Then Captain Mortimer turned to Kearns and whispered:\r\n\r\n“I suppose ’twouldn’t do for me to absent myself for half an hour--to\r\ngo downstairs for one dance.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” replied Kearns. “The King hasn’t yet retired and isn’t\r\nlikely to for some time. It’s certainly too early to expect anything.\r\nGo, by all means, but don’t stay too long.”\r\n\r\nStill Captain Mortimer hesitated.\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t like by my absence to spoil any chance,” he said.\r\n\r\n“No danger,” answered Kearns; “besides, should anything happen\r\nunexpectedly, we could summon Captain Swords.”\r\n\r\n“But he’s on duty in the King’s antechamber.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we could immediately send for you to take his place.”\r\n\r\n“That would be somewhat irregular,” objected Captain Mortimer.\r\n\r\n“Go,” insisted Kearns. “You’ll be perfectly safe in doing so, provided\r\nyou are back here by the time the King retires.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, long before that,” answered the Captain, and off he started for\r\nthe ball-room, Captain Swords returning to his post of duty in the\r\nantechamber.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the ball-room, Captain Mortimer had little difficulty in\r\ndiscovering Beatrice, seated between Dorothy Brandon and Baroness\r\nMaquehaye. He made his way to where they sat and, presenting himself\r\nbefore them, bowed.\r\n\r\n“I come under orders from Captain Swords,” he said to Beatrice, “to act\r\nas his proxy for this waltz. May I have that honor?”\r\n\r\nBut the young lady looked up at him with large and mischievous eyes.\r\n\r\n“I’m so angry with Captain Swords,” she answered severely, “that I’ll\r\nnot dance with him even by proxy. I’ve decided to give the waltz to\r\nCount D’Arville, of the French Legation. Ask Miss Brandon. Perhaps she\r\nmay take pity on--Captain Swords’ proxy.”\r\n\r\nAt these audacious words, Miss Brandon turned several colors and cast a\r\nsharp and furious glance upon Beatrice, who sat demurely looking up at\r\nthe Captain. Captain Mortimer also glanced quickly at the speaker, but\r\nif the glance conveyed astonishment it certainly contained no anger.\r\nWith presence of mind, he turned to Dorothy.\r\n\r\n“You’ve witnessed my discomfiture,” he said. “Won’t you take pity on\r\nme?”\r\n\r\n“As a proxy?” she asked, with an arch upward flash of the eyes.\r\n\r\n“As a proxy, or--as you will!”\r\n\r\nFor answer she rose and took his arm.\r\n\r\nThey gained their positions upon the floor; the band struck up the\r\nopening bars. Once more his arm encircled her; once more he held her\r\nto him, as they glided around and around, amid the maze of waltzers.\r\nAgain he felt the intoxication of her presence; the sweet, pleasurable\r\nthrill of physical contact which set heart and nerves a-throb within\r\nhim. Through his brain there flitted the wild phantasy that for the mad\r\njoy of holding her enfolded in his arms, her heart crushed against his\r\nheart, his lips to her lips--that for one long minute of such ecstasy\r\nhe would be willing to suffer instant annihilation thereafter. Then\r\ncame the thought, sharp as a sword-thrust, that perhaps this waltz was\r\ntheir last, their eternal farewell; that never again might he hold her\r\nthus. So they danced on, the minutes seeming as seconds, until the band\r\nplayed the final bar and the waltz was at an end.\r\n\r\nHalf-dazed, he started to lead her back to her seat, but with a gentle\r\nrestraining pressure upon his arm, she stopped him.\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to return yet,” she said, and the look she gave him was\r\nhalf-beseeching, half-imperious. “Let us walk around a little. You\r\ndon’t mind, do you?”\r\n\r\nMind! What was he not willing to pay for every additional moment that\r\ngave him her gracious presence!\r\n\r\nHe did not--he could not--answer, but he instantly turned and with\r\nher on his arm, walked in the opposite direction. There was too much\r\ncrowding upon the floor for comfortable walking; mechanically, without\r\nintention on his part, he made his way to the entrance to the great\r\nconservatory and they passed in.\r\n\r\n“I suppose this is the last place I should seek,” he said, at last\r\nfinding speech and scarce knowing what he was saying.\r\n\r\n“Why?” she asked archly.\r\n\r\n“A soldier, you know, seldom cares to revisit the scene of a reverse,”\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n“I have read somewhere,” she answered demurely, “that all great\r\nsoldiers seek to retrieve a reverse, and Captain Mortimer, it is said,\r\nis a great soldier.”\r\n\r\n“I thank you for the compliment,” he answered with some embarrassment;\r\n“but I fear you are amusing yourself at my expense.”\r\n\r\n“One doesn’t amuse oneself,” she answered gravely, “at the expense of\r\nthose who wear that Order,” and she touched lightly with her gloved\r\nfinger-tips the Columbia Cross glittering upon his breast. “You must\r\ntell me some day the story of how that was won,” she continued in a low\r\nvoice. “I’d like to hear the details from your own lips.”\r\n\r\n“I fear narration is not my strong point,” he answered, again evincing\r\nembarrassment. “Besides,” he added hastily, “the credit of that affair\r\nreally belonged most largely to the dearest fellow on earth--my\r\ncomrade, Ralph Swords.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve heard of Captain Swords’ connection with that affair,” said\r\nDorothy dryly; “but I don’t always believe quite all I hear.”\r\n\r\n“No?”\r\n\r\n“No,” she replied, “just as people sometimes say things they don’t\r\nfully mean, I suppose. For instance,” she continued with meaning,\r\n“indelicate and careless remarks in the excitement of play at\r\nbaccarat!”\r\n\r\n“Indelicate and careless remarks--baccarat!” he repeated, with evident\r\nwonderment. “I realize I am stupid, but I don’t understand.”\r\n\r\nShe turned her great eyes upon his face and as she saw the perplexity\r\nthere her heart gave a joyful leap. Long ago she had to herself fully\r\nexonerated him and had pitilessly condemned herself for having ever\r\nentertained a single doubt. Now, it seemed, the entire story of the\r\ninfamous Brooke was a falsehood woven out of whole cloth. Still, with\r\nthe spirit of inquisition natural to womankind, she determined to probe\r\nthe entire matter to the bitter end.\r\n\r\n“Yes; at baccarat, I said,” she answered gayly. “Weren’t you with the\r\nTenth before you came to the Guards?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he answered, wondering what was coming next.\r\n\r\n“And the Tenth were sorry gamblers, were they not?” she persisted. “Was\r\nthere not a great deal of baccarat playing toward the close of the\r\nseason at Oldport?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know whether I ought to disclose the secrets of the\r\nmess-room,” he replied; “but I don’t mind admitting what was generally\r\nknown and talked about. Your information is quite correct, I regret to\r\nsay.”\r\n\r\n“You regret?” she asked. “Why? It is rumored that Captain Mortimer was\r\none of the most assiduous devotees.”\r\n\r\n“Then rumor falsifies,” he answered gravely; “for I disapprove upon\r\nmilitary grounds of all forms of gambling in military quarters. _I\r\nnever played baccarat in a regimental mess-room in my life._”\r\n\r\nShe gave a little cry of astonishment and joy. Complete, indeed, was\r\nthis refutation of the tale of the Brooke!\r\n\r\n“Why,” she exclaimed, with the inconsequence of a true woman, “why did\r\nyou never tell me this before?”\r\n\r\n“Tell you before!” he repeated. “Why should I?”\r\n\r\n“Never mind,” she answered, panting, “I’m still quite angry with you.”\r\n\r\n“Angry?” he asked, perturbed. “Why? Because I haven’t played baccarat?”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” she retorted impatiently. “Because you are so credulous.”\r\n\r\n“Credulous?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she replied petulantly. “What was that interesting story told to\r\nyou at the last ball regarding a certain lady who shall be nameless?\r\nA story which you accepted and believed, I suppose!” she added\r\nindignantly.\r\n\r\nHe stared straight ahead and made no reply.\r\n\r\n“Oh, it was told to you in strictest confidence, I presume?” she pouted.\r\n\r\n“That which I’m told in confidence I make a point of forgetting I’ve\r\never heard,” he replied, fencing. “You surely will not blame me?”\r\n\r\n“That’s doubtless right,” she admitted; “but let me say,” she added\r\nwith meaning, “the waters of a certain Brooke may babble not only\r\nunceasingly, but also very falsely. Will you bear that in mind if you\r\nshould remember a certain confidence?”\r\n\r\n“You’re not angry with me?” he pleaded.\r\n\r\n“Very little,” she answered; “in fact, so little that you may have the\r\nnext waltz--if you care for it.”\r\n\r\nA troubled look came into his face.\r\n\r\n“I fear I can’t,” he replied with disappointment. “I’m on duty and must\r\nreturn at once.”\r\n\r\n“On duty!” she exclaimed; “why, I understood Captain Swords was on\r\nguard to-night?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he replied, “he is; but I’m on special duty--a scouting\r\nexpedition, I might say.”\r\n\r\n“A scouting expedition!” she repeated. “You speak as if it were a time\r\nof war. Tell me about it.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t,” he answered reluctantly. “I am pledged upon honor not to\r\nspeak of it.”\r\n\r\nHer blue eyes opened wide in mingled astonishment and concern.\r\n\r\n“If there is so much secrecy,” she said slowly, “it must be a matter of\r\nimportance. Is there any danger to--to--you?”\r\n\r\n“I could hardly say there is,” he answered lightly. “Call it an\r\ninteresting little adventure--nothing more serious than that.”\r\n\r\nBut she was not lightly to be put aside.\r\n\r\n“On your honor, is there no danger?”\r\n\r\n“None that I know of,” he answered reassuringly.\r\n\r\n“That you know of?” she repeated. “Then you can’t tell.”\r\n\r\n“No,” he admitted, “the circumstances are so novel--so unusual--I can’t\r\ntell.”\r\n\r\nThey had reached a secluded part of the great conservatory and stood\r\nfacing each other, she with downcast eyes, he looking down upon her\r\nwith rapt admiration.\r\n\r\n“I must return,” he whispered; “although never did I go to duty so\r\nunwillingly.”\r\n\r\nShe took his arm and they walked slowly back toward the ball-room.\r\n\r\n“Why so silent?” he whispered to her as they walked.\r\n\r\nShe sighed.\r\n\r\n“I have a foreboding,” she answered sadly, “that this undertaking--this\r\nsecret expedition of which you cannot speak--is one of difficulty and\r\nof danger.”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” he answered cheerily; “you’re mistaken. But,” he added in a\r\nlow voice, “were it so, would you care?”\r\n\r\nFor answer, she looked upward and her glance met his. Softly he\r\nwhispered to her and more softly still came her whispered reply--a\r\nreply that brought the light to his eyes and the hot flush of joy to\r\nhis cheeks.\r\n\r\nIt was with that light in his eyes, that color in his cheeks, they\r\npassed out of the conservatory into the ball-room. Not ten paces from\r\nthem as they entered stood a man wearing the uniform of the Imperial\r\nGuard. As they walked, he looked after them, with black brows bent\r\nand an expression in the dark face that was not good to look upon. He\r\nturned sharply at a tap from a lady’s fan upon his arm, the scowl still\r\nupon his face.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Lady Brooke!”\r\n\r\n“A word with you, Milord Ashley,” she said.\r\n\r\nHe led her aside and they stood for some minutes engaged in\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n“I’ll do it,” he said to her as she was about to pass on. “You may\r\ncount upon my managing it.”\r\n\r\n“And you may count upon me,” she answered, “to repair matters when the\r\nproper time comes. As you are aware, I still have some influence with\r\nHis Majesty.”\r\n\r\nLord Ashley bowed low.\r\n\r\n“Repair, eh!” he muttered under his black mustache when she had gone,\r\n“if you’ll consult the past, Milady, you’ll find that when I’ve\r\nfinished with those who cross my path, there’s little left to repair!\r\nYour suggestion is good, though, Milady! You certainly are a born\r\n_intrigante_. An excellent suggestion, indeed! And I’ll lose no time in\r\ncarrying it out!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nWHEN GREEK MEETS GREEK\r\n\r\n\r\nA last, lingering pressure of the hand, a hasty exit from the ball-room\r\nand Captain Mortimer hurried back to his post of duty. He reached the\r\ncorridor, returned the salutes of the three sentinels as he passed, and\r\nwent into the antechamber. He stopped for several minutes’ conversation\r\nwith Captain Swords and then made his way to the first door of the\r\nChancellerie suite. A light tap and the door was opened by Kearns.\r\n\r\n“Back in good time, I hope!” whispered the Captain.\r\n\r\n“In plenty of time,” Kearns whispered in return, as he hastily closed\r\nthe door. “I’m glad you went. It’s not very interesting sitting here in\r\nthe dark, without even the privilege of a comforting cigar. Still, I’ve\r\nhad a few experiences of the kind before.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Mortimer removed his sword and stored it away in the air-ship.\r\nIt was a strict military regulation that officers should appear abroad\r\nonly in uniform and wearing their swords.\r\n\r\n“I’d suggest,” he said as he took his seat beside them, “that it\r\nmight help pass the time if Mr. Kearns would tell us some of the many\r\ninteresting experiences he doubtless had in his time. The darkness here\r\nwill lend an additional thrill. What say you, Professor?”\r\n\r\n“We’ll get enough thrills before we’re through with this adventure,\r\nprovided our friend Kearns’ theory is correct,” replied the Professor\r\ndryly; “still, if he’ll tell a story, I’ll be glad to listen.”\r\n\r\n“No, no;” protested Kearns; “all my interest is centered in that park\r\nand in watching for what may come from over those tree-tops. Ah,\r\nlisten!”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke there came three faint, but distinct, taps on the door;\r\nthen a pause, followed by four similar taps.\r\n\r\nIt was the agreed signal which Captain Swords was to give when the King\r\nretired.\r\n\r\n“From now on we may expect something,” remarked the Professor.\r\n\r\n“Interesting but scientifically inaccurate,” retorted Kearns.\r\n“Before long we may expect, but not just yet. You must allow for\r\nsome time after the retirement of the King before you can expect any\r\nmanifestations. It’s now fully an hour earlier than the time of the\r\npreceding visit.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so,” replied the Professor; “still I’ll wager, for all that, you\r\nwouldn’t care to have us go to sleep during the next hour.”\r\n\r\n“Right you are,” assented Kearns; “one can never be quite sure what may\r\nhappen. Those fellows, whoever they may be, seem to know pretty well\r\nwhat takes place in the palace. They doubtless have a confederate, or\r\nconfederates, on the inside.”\r\n\r\n“You think so?” said Captain Mortimer. “Have you made any efforts to\r\ndiscover?”\r\n\r\n“None whatever,” answered Kearns. “I’ve been too busy with other\r\nmatters. I’m after the main quarry. The subordinate details, if\r\nnecessary, can be attended to later.”\r\n\r\nThis seemed sound reasoning and neither of the others ventured a reply.\r\nThe moments slowly passed. They sat there in the darkness exchanging\r\nonly occasional whispers. They heard the chime of one of the palace\r\nclocks--an hour had passed and still nothing. Again the clock chimed;\r\nit was the quarter. The sound had barely died away in the darkness of\r\nthe summer night, when Kearns laid a light touch upon the Professor’s\r\narm.\r\n\r\n“_At last!_”\r\n\r\nThe three bent their heads together.\r\n\r\n“Look upward--to the right!” came the low whisper.\r\n\r\nThey strained their eyes in the direction indicated. Faintly seen in\r\nthe darkness was a shadowy something, the outline of some black object\r\nfloating in the air.\r\n\r\n“Steady!” whispered Kearns, in an ever so faint whisper. “Not a move\r\ntill I give the word!”\r\n\r\nThe dark object, though still indistinct, became gradually more\r\nclearly outlined. It crossed at some little distance out and above\r\ntheir window, passed the windows of the King’s apartment and was lost\r\nto their view opposite the window of the antechamber where the King’s\r\nofficer on duty kept guard.\r\n\r\n“An air-ship--an air-ship, sure enough,” whispered the Professor. “And\r\napparently painted dead black.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so,” replied Kearns, “but this time we’ll match your gray one\r\nagainst the black. Great Scott! To think that I’m not in the race.”\r\n\r\nSeveral minutes passed and the ship did not reappear.\r\n\r\n“My God!” exclaimed Captain Mortimer, “you haven’t allowed them to\r\nescape us?”\r\n\r\n“Hush, no!” answered Kearns; “do not fear. They’re cute ones. They’re\r\nscouting and ’ll surely return.”\r\n\r\nThe whispered words had hardly left his lips when the air-ship\r\nreappeared. This time it halted in a line with the King’s window.\r\n\r\n“Steady and quiet!” said Kearns. “The time has come.”\r\n\r\nQuickly, silently they rose and took their positions in the air-ship,\r\nas it lay upon its rests. Stealthily Kearns crept to the window and\r\nwith one turn of the well-oiled and carefully prepared machinery, the\r\nentire bay window curved outward, leaving a wide opening. Through\r\nthis gap, the launch-like air-ship skilfully guided by the Professor,\r\ngracefully slid into the night. Rapid as had been these movements, they\r\nwere not more rapid than those of the attacking party. As the window\r\nflew back and the prow of the air-ship passed out, the Professor and\r\nMortimer saw them loosen their mooring, turn about and away. By the\r\ntime the opening had been cleared, the pursued were several lengths in\r\nthe lead, but the royal air-ship was following hot in their wake.\r\n\r\nHigh over the tree-tops of the park they flew and on and on until\r\nthey reached the river. Thus far they had maintained their respective\r\ndistances, neither apparently gaining or losing.\r\n\r\n“Turn on the flash-light!” called out the Professor, “or we may lose\r\nthem in the darkness.”\r\n\r\nAn instant later a bright stream of light shot forth from the prow of\r\nthe “Royal Dean,” flooding with its radiance the pursued.\r\n\r\nCaptain Mortimer and the Professor saw that the craft before them was\r\nslightly larger than their own, of a dead black color and contained\r\nthree men.\r\n\r\n“Ahoy, there!” came a moment later the hail from the pursued. “Who are\r\nyou? What company do you belong to?”\r\n\r\nCaptain Mortimer rose to his feet.\r\n\r\n“Halt!” he commanded.\r\n\r\nAt sight of his uniform in the glare of the search-light, there seemed\r\nto be a sudden consternation among the pursued. Their air-ship shot\r\nupward to greater heights. Instantly the Professor handled his levers\r\nand followed. A hurried conference between the pursued seemed to be\r\ntaking place.\r\n\r\nCaptain Mortimer picked up a repeating rifle from the floor of the\r\nair-ship.\r\n\r\n“Surrender!” he shouted, his voice ringing strong and clear;\r\n“surrender, you rebels, in the name of the King!”\r\n\r\nNo attention was given to this summons. The pursued kept steadily on,\r\nheading toward the north.\r\n\r\n“Halt!” again commanded Captain Mortimer, raising his rifle. “Halt, or\r\nI fire!”\r\n\r\nFor answer to this, a man appeared in the stern of the pursued bearing\r\nbefore him a bowed shield. From the ease with which he handled it, it\r\nwas apparently very light but doubtless strong enough to withstand a\r\nbullet. There was a steel projection at the base of this shield and, in\r\nthe light of the flash-light, they saw him drop this projection into\r\na socket. The shield was thus held in place and the occupants of the\r\nair-ship protected from any pistol, or rifle fire, from the rear.\r\n\r\nIt was a revelation to the pursuers. The attacking party was not only\r\nfurnished as an aërial scout, but was furthermore equipped as a species\r\nof armored aërial cruiser. The Professor drew his companion’s attention\r\nto this fact.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Captain Mortimer, “and if they were supplied with means\r\nof offense, such as repeating rifles, they would be not only an aërial\r\ncruiser, but a very effective aërial man-of-war. Do you think there’s\r\nany vital part of their craft, so that I could disable them with a\r\nbullet?”\r\n\r\n“Our craft could not be so disabled,” answered the Professor; “neither,\r\nso far as I can judge, could theirs be.”\r\n\r\n“Then we must flank them,” said Captain Mortimer, “and try to bring\r\nthem to terms in that way.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” answered the Professor; “I’ll see what I can do.”\r\n\r\nHe accordingly endeavored to navigate his craft to a position on their\r\nleft quarter, but the pursued were wary and quickly shifted, keeping\r\nthe protecting shield between themselves and the pursuers. At last, by\r\nclever manœuvering, the Professor had almost succeeded, when up went\r\nanother shield, effectually protecting a large section of that quarter.\r\n\r\n“It’s no use,” exclaimed Mortimer, laying down the rifle; “it’s a\r\nveritable armored cruiser. No matter what quarter we flank them on,\r\nthey undoubtedly have enough shields to protect all sides. By heaven!\r\nthey seem to be drawing away from us.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; they’ve certainly increased the distance between us somewhat,”\r\nassented the Professor, “but they’re not as far away as they were a\r\nfew minutes ago. I don’t understand it. They seem to gain and then we\r\nseem to creep up on them a little. Perhaps this may be due to certain\r\neffects of the air currents, but it is decidedly peculiar.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Mortimer made no reply. He sat watching the pursued craft,\r\ndistinctly outlined in the rays of the flash-light. On and on they\r\nrushed at topmost speed through the yielding air, grown raw and chilly.\r\nThe first streaks of light began to flicker in the east. The pursued\r\nnow rose to still greater altitudes, until the air became uncomfortably\r\nrarified. The Professor manipulated his levers and the pursuers\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n“What are they up to now?” asked Captain Mortimer. “Trying to dodge us?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” answered the Professor. “It looks more to me as if they were\r\ntrying to keep out of sight of land as the daylight comes.”\r\n\r\n“Any chance of our giving out?”\r\n\r\n“No; we can keep this up for many hours yet.”\r\n\r\n“And they?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. Judging from the qualities they have shown so far, it’s\r\nbest to assume they are fully as well equipped as we.”\r\n\r\n“What are the prospects of overtaking them?”\r\n\r\n“Not very favorable, I should say,” replied the Professor. “We’ve been\r\ngoing at our topmost ever since we started and yet we haven’t gained\r\nupon them. In fact, they’ve gained a trifle on us. You see, they are\r\nsomewhat larger and probably have more power. As it is, I am astonished\r\nwe haven’t lost them before now.”\r\n\r\n“What’s the likelihood of our losing them altogether?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t say,” replied the Professor, “but our chances against losing\r\nthem improve every minute as the light comes on. We’ll soon be able to\r\nat least keep them in sight for a very great distance. You may shut off\r\nthe flash-light now.”\r\n\r\n“There’s nothing you can suggest?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” answered the Professor. “Under existing conditions, there\r\nare only two courses open to us.”\r\n\r\n“And they are?”\r\n\r\n“Either to keep on as we are doing, or give it up as a bad job.”\r\n\r\n“Give up!” exclaimed Mortimer in a disgusted tone. “I’m unalterably\r\nopposed to that. We started out to follow them, and follow them we\r\nwill until either this air-ship gives out or we overtake them.”\r\n\r\n“Or we lose sight of them,” suggested the Professor.\r\n\r\n“Or we lose sight of them,” assented Mortimer grudgingly; “but I trust\r\nyou’ll do your best to avoid that.”\r\n\r\n“You may count upon it that I will,” answered the Professor stoutly.\r\n\r\n“Besides,” continued Mortimer, “they can’t keep this up forever.\r\nThey’re making for some point and some time or other they must effect\r\na landing. Then it will become interesting. Hello! what are they up to\r\nnow?”\r\n\r\n“They are descending. See! they are increasing the distance between us,\r\ntoo.”\r\n\r\n“If they descend, it will give me a chance to pot them from above,”\r\nsuggested the Captain, again taking up the rifle.\r\n\r\n“It seems awful to fire upon them,” exclaimed the Professor wistfully;\r\n“especially as they are not offering us any attack, but are only\r\nseeking to escape.”\r\n\r\n“Fire upon them!” cried Mortimer warmly; “I may fire, but I have\r\ncertainly no intention of hitting them. I would, though, send the\r\nbullets sufficiently close to make matters look serious and possibly\r\nstop them. But to shoot men in cold blood--never! I am an American\r\nsoldier, sir, of the twentieth century and we’ve nothing in common,\r\nthank God! with the assassins of your day--the butchers of Little Knee\r\nand the murderers of gallant Sitting Bull.”\r\n\r\n“Sitting Bull!” exclaimed Professor Dean, with astonishment, “so he has\r\npassed down in history as one of the legendary heroes and a reproach to\r\nthe men of my day.”\r\n\r\n“Very decidedly,” answered Mortimer. “You should read Goodrow’s\r\nhistory on the subject and Krebiel’s noble poem, ‘The Death of Sitting\r\nBull.’”\r\n\r\n“History is certainly a strange thing,” commented the Professor.\r\n“Argument is somewhat difficult at this altitude; besides, I’ve these\r\npesky levers to look after. I should like to take up that subject with\r\nyou later, though. By the way, do they still play a game called ‘poker’\r\nthese days?”\r\n\r\n“My dear Professor,” answered Mortimer, “the American game of poker is\r\nimmortal.”\r\n\r\n“And they still bluff at the game?”\r\n\r\n“Probably more so than ever.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll not have an opportunity of trying the bluff you spoke of,” said\r\nthe Professor, as he nodded toward the pursued. “See the protecting\r\nshield go up.”\r\n\r\nMortimer looked and saw a shield had been so adjusted as to at least\r\npartially protect the air-ship from an attack from above.\r\n\r\n“A cunning set!” commented Mortimer.\r\n\r\n“That’s what our friend Kearns said they were,” replied the Professor.\r\n“I suppose we had best follow them and return toward earth.”\r\n\r\nAgain the Professor juggled with his levers and they shot rapidly\r\ndownward.\r\n\r\n“There’s something else going on there,” remarked Mortimer as he eyed\r\nthe pursued. “What is it?”\r\n\r\nThey had descended many hundreds of feet. A number of mountain tops,\r\napparently forming part of an extensive range, were more or less\r\nindistinctly outlined below.\r\n\r\n“Mountains?” commented the Professor.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Mortimer, “and from the general lay of the land I should\r\nsay the heart of the Adirondacks. But what are they doing there?” he\r\ninquired eagerly, pointing to the pursued, who were manœuvering with\r\nsome instrument projecting over one of their quarters.\r\n\r\nThe Professor watched closely for some minutes.\r\n\r\n“It’s some signaling instrument,” he said at last. “They are signaling\r\nthe land.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III\r\n\r\nIN THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n“WHO ARE YOU”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe movements of the pursued craft, which Professor Dean described as\r\nsignals, continued for only a short time and then once more the pursued\r\nrose to a great altitude. The “Royal Dean” tenaciously followed.\r\n\r\n“I thought we were going back to earth, but now it seems that we are\r\nheaven-bound,” remarked the Professor.\r\n\r\n“Whether they make for heaven or the other place, we’ll follow them as\r\nlong as there is a follow left in us,” answered Mortimer grimly.\r\n\r\nFor some twenty miles the mysterious craft kept its way, then, still at\r\nthe same altitude, suddenly described a great semicircle, and laid a\r\ncourse due south.\r\n\r\n“What are they up to now?” questioned Mortimer.\r\n\r\n“Blessed if I know,” replied the Professor. “It looks very much as if\r\nwe were going back the way we came.”\r\n\r\n“Curious!” commented Mortimer. “I suppose we can only follow and await\r\ndevelopments.”\r\n\r\n“That’s all,” assented the Professor.\r\n\r\nThe opinion expressed by Professor Dean that they were returning over\r\npractically the same course proved to be correct. Back they went for\r\nsome twenty miles, and then the pursued began to descend, followed, of\r\ncourse, by their obstinate pursuers.\r\n\r\nThe occupants of “The Royal Dean” perceived they were dropping into a\r\ngreat valley, shut in on all sides by towering mountain tops.\r\n\r\n“It seems we are to make a landing at last,” remarked Mortimer,\r\nscanning the valley beneath.\r\n\r\nThere was no reply to this remark. Mortimer turned leisurely to address\r\nthe Professor again, but was startled to see the latter staring with\r\ndilated eyes into space.\r\n\r\n“See!” he gasped. “There! Ah, and there!”\r\n\r\nMortimer looked in the direction indicated and was dumbfounded to\r\nperceive to the westward, slightly above them, another air-ship bearing\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n“Look over there!” exclaimed the Professor, pointing to the East.\r\n\r\nMortimer shifted his glance to another air-ship. An instant later two\r\nmore appeared, the one to the North and the other, beyond the line of\r\nthe pursued air-ship, to the South.\r\n\r\n“We’re surrounded,” gasped the Professor, amazed. “What’ll we do? Try\r\nto escape? I fear, though, it will be useless, judging from the speed\r\nwhich I see they develop.”\r\n\r\n“Useless or not,” replied Mortimer obstinately, “we started out to\r\nfollow that air-ship and follow it we will to the bitter end.”\r\n\r\nEven as they spoke, the four air-ships were rapidly closing in upon\r\nthem and they could see that they were several times the size of the\r\n“Royal Dean” and that they carried a number of men. As they drew\r\nnearer, they saw what appeared to be miniature cannon protruding from\r\ntheir quarters. An instant later the air-ship to the West came within\r\nhailing distance. A man stepped to the prow and shouted something which\r\nthey did not clearly hear.\r\n\r\n“They evidently want to speak to us,” said Dean, and he slowed down and\r\ncame to a stop.\r\n\r\nThe air-ship to the West also checked its speed, but still kept slowly\r\napproaching. The other three air-ships were fast closing in.\r\n\r\n“Why did you stop?” asked Mortimer with some annoyance. “We don’t want\r\nto let those fellows get away from us.” He nodded in the direction of\r\nthe pursued.\r\n\r\n“No fear,” answered the Professor. “They are descending straight into\r\nthe valley.”\r\n\r\n“Hello!” shouted Mortimer to the air-ship to the West.\r\n\r\n“Hello!” came back the answer. “Who are you?”\r\n\r\n“His Majesty’s air-ship, the ‘Royal Dean’,” replied Mortimer, adding\r\nwith an aside and a chuckle to the Professor: “How’s that?”\r\n\r\nThe reply appeared to exercise a strange effect upon the men addressed.\r\nThe man in the bow turned to those behind him and a brief parley seemed\r\nto ensue. Finally he turned about and again hailed them.\r\n\r\n“You are our prisoners!” he shouted.\r\n\r\n“Prisoners!” roared back Mortimer. “By what authority do you dare thus\r\naddress an officer of the King’s Guard?”\r\n\r\nAll four air-ships had now drawn quite close and had come to a stop.\r\nAll were drifting in the air currents.\r\n\r\n“Authority!” called back the spokesman. “You’ll learn that later.\r\nSurrender!”\r\n\r\nMortimer was standing in the extreme bow of the air-ship. He turned to\r\nhis companion.\r\n\r\n“Professor, hand me that rifle.”\r\n\r\nProfessor Dean bent forward and picked up the rifle from the floor\r\nof the air-ship. As he rose with the weapon in his hand there came a\r\nwarning shout from the spokesman.\r\n\r\n“Fire one shot,” he cried, “and we will blow you to the moon!”\r\n\r\n“You scoundrels!” called back Mortimer, “try it!” And he turned to the\r\nProfessor, holding out his hand for the rifle.\r\n\r\nThe Professor calmly drew back and dropped it over the side of the\r\nair-ship.\r\n\r\n“What have you done--what have you done?” cried Mortimer furiously.\r\n\r\n“Saved you from yourself!” replied his companion coolly. “I don’t mind\r\nyour fighting when you have half a chance, but to resist here is sheer\r\nmadness.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Mortimer paused an instant, hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n“I suppose you’re entitled to some consideration in this matter,” he\r\nsaid sulkily. “There may be some truth in what you say. Perhaps I can\r\nbest aid the cause I serve by exercising diplomacy for the moment and\r\nbiding my time.”\r\n\r\n“Now you’re talking concentrated sense,” replied the Professor. “That’s\r\nthe proper way to look at it.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the air-ship on either side had drawn close in upon them.\r\nEach of these air-ships threw out a long, powerful prong, resembling a\r\ngiant boat-hook, and held “The Royal Dean” securely. Words of command\r\nrang out and an instant later the two air-ships began descending at\r\nmoderate speed to the valley below, drawing down the captive craft\r\nbetween them. Mortimer picked up his sword and buckled it about his\r\nwaist. The Professor was silent. Both stood in their respective\r\npositions, expectant and alert but offering no further resistance.\r\n\r\nThey reached the bottom of the valley and gently grounded upon tufted\r\ngrass. As they did so, the captives glanced about and saw that they\r\nwere surrounded by a number of rough-looking men, who had evidently\r\nbeen awaiting the landing. They also saw with some astonishment that\r\nin the forward rank stood a young woman, jauntily attired in a natty\r\nhunting costume. A short skirt of some dark material fell over a pair\r\nof high-laced russet shoes and a pert red feather peeped forth from\r\nthe saucy little hat which covered her short black curls. As she stood\r\nwatching the captives, her cheeks flushed with excitement and her black\r\neyes sparkling, she presented a remarkably pretty picture of a brunette\r\nof the slender, sinuous type.\r\n\r\nThere were hurried exclamations, greetings and questions--addressed by\r\nthe men on the ground to the men in the arriving air-ships. The answers\r\nseemed to cause considerable perturbation and excitement. At a word of\r\ncommand two men stepped forward and seized Captain Mortimer roughly by\r\nthe shoulders.\r\n\r\nIn an instant he had shaken them off, and with two smashing blows sent\r\nthem sprawling to the ground.\r\n\r\n“I surrender,” he said; “not to you, you scum; to the lady!”\r\n\r\nAnd he raised his hand in military salute.\r\n\r\nOne of the men struck lay on the ground, apparently stunned, but the\r\nother sprang to his feet with an oath. His hand flew to the back of\r\nhis belt and out flashed a long, ugly-looking knife. Mortimer sprang\r\nlightly over the quarter, set his back against the side of the air-ship\r\nand drew his sword. A murmur--half-angry, half-excited--went up from\r\nthe surrounding groups of men. At the prospect of a fight their\r\ncuriosity and interest were whetted. The man with the knife crouched as\r\nif seeking an opportunity to spring in and attack, while Mortimer stood\r\ncoolly on the defensive, a half smile upon his face, as he watched the\r\nman’s awkward points.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the girl turned and hastily whispered to a tall,\r\nrawboned man who had just climbed out of one of the capturing\r\nair-ships. He instantly broke through the ranks and came forward.\r\n\r\n“Back, Jackson,” he cried to the man with the knife; “quit now!”\r\n\r\n“He hit me,” replied the man, with a savage growl, “and I’m going to\r\nrip him up. Out o’ the way, Cap’n.”\r\n\r\n“It looks as if two could play at that game,” replied the man addressed\r\nas Captain, with a grin. “Back, I say. This man is a prisoner and goes\r\nbefore the Colonel.”\r\n\r\nWith some hesitancy the man sheathed his knife and slunk back among his\r\nfellows.\r\n\r\n“Follow me!” said the Captain to Mortimer; “and you, too,” he added,\r\nnodding to the Professor.\r\n\r\nThe latter clambered over the side of the air-ship.\r\n\r\n“I’m ready,” he said.\r\n\r\n“But I don’t know whether I am,” cried Mortimer, still standing sword\r\nin hand. “Who are you? A military organization, or a band of outlaws? I\r\nhear you speak of captains and colonels! And by what authority do you\r\ntalk of prisoners?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t answer your questions,” replied the other, civilly enough;\r\n“but if you follow me, you’ll perhaps learn all you want to know.”\r\n\r\n“Diplomacy!” whispered the Professor. “Let me again urge diplomacy.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said Mortimer, sheathing his sword; “let’s see this farce\r\nthrough to the end.”\r\n\r\nThey accordingly fell in on either side of their conductor, who led the\r\nway for some little distance down the valley, abruptly turning to the\r\nright into a broad, deep cañon. Packed in the cañon in long rows and\r\nheaps were what appeared to be quantities of stores covered with huge\r\ntarpaulins. Here and there were large, cave-like openings in the sides\r\nof the hill, with men passing in and out. It was evidently an extensive\r\nencampment and these cave-like openings either led into quarters for\r\nthe men, or were storing places for more material.\r\n\r\nThe most astonishing spectacle of all presented itself at the further\r\nend of the cañon, where a big, roughly-built, black-bearded man,\r\ndressed in buck-skin and broad-brimmed felt hat, a leather belt about\r\nhis waist and drawn sword in hand, was drilling a squad of men. A short\r\ndistance away was a large tent, with a smaller one on either side.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he perceived the three approaching, the man in command of\r\nthe squad gave an order to a subordinate and advanced toward them. He\r\nstopped when some twenty paces away and motioned to the man in charge\r\nof the two prisoners to approach. The latter did so and in a low tone\r\nmade his report, whereupon the leader turned abruptly upon his heel\r\nand made his way to the central tent. The man who had been conducting\r\nMortimer and Dean returned to them.\r\n\r\n“You’re to go before the Colonel,” he said.\r\n\r\n“The Colonel!” exclaimed Mortimer, with a guffaw. “Colonel of what?\r\nMay I inquire what regiment this is?”\r\n\r\n“Ask that of the Colonel,” was the answer.\r\n\r\n“At least tell us the name of this Colonel?”\r\n\r\nTheir conductor hesitated a moment.\r\n\r\n“You may call him Colonel Henry,” he said.\r\n\r\n“And you? You bear the rank of Captain, it seems. How may we address\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“I am second in command here and you may call me Captain Robert.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, indeed!” exclaimed Mortimer with sarcasm; “an un-uniformed body of\r\nmen, whose officers all seem to be known by their first names. I’ll be\r\nmuch interested to discover the nature of this organization.”\r\n\r\n“Traitors are apt to turn up in every cause,” was the grave answer,\r\n“although this cause has never known one so far. Hence it’s wise to\r\ntake every precaution.”\r\n\r\n“Cause--what cause?” inquired Mortimer.\r\n\r\n“No more questions, please,” answered Captain Robert. “I bear you no\r\nill-will and I want to give you a word of friendly advice. Speak to the\r\nColonel softly and civilly. He’s a hard man at times and it will be\r\nwell to remember you are in his power.”\r\n\r\nMortimer was about to reply, but the Professor hastily interposed.\r\n\r\n“I take your advice in the spirit in which it is given,” he said, “and\r\nI thank you.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Robert led the way to the central tent, ushered in his two\r\nprisoners and retired. As he did so, a squad of six men, armed with\r\nrifles, fell into line behind Dean and Mortimer. The latter found\r\nthemselves confronted with Colonel Henry, who was seated before a large\r\ntable facing the entrance to the tent.\r\n\r\n“Your names,” he asked curtly, with a scowl.\r\n\r\n“I’m Captain Mortimer, of the Imperial Guard, and this is Professor\r\nDean,” was Mortimer’s reply. “Who are you?”\r\n\r\n“Since when have prisoners taken to doing the questioning?” asked the\r\nother, with an ugly sneer.\r\n\r\n“Prisoners!” retorted Mortimer, scornfully, “to whom--to what\r\nauthority?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, prisoners!” was the answer with rising fury, “and if you’ve any\r\ndoubt on that score, I’ll soon convince you of the fact.”\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment and calmed himself with an effort.\r\n\r\n“You are prisoners,” he continued, “just as the rest of the Imperial\r\nGuard will be soon--prisoners or dead.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Mortimer laughed derisively. Trained in the roughness of\r\nservice in camp and field, he was no great adept in the milder methods\r\nof diplomacy and the soft answer that turneth away wrath.\r\n\r\n“Since when did you escape from safe-keeping?” he asked contemptuously.\r\n\r\nHenry rose to his feet, his face flushed with anger.\r\n\r\n“You may laugh,” he cried, “but what I say is true. They’ll all be\r\nprisoners, or dead!”\r\n\r\nMortimer shrugged his shoulders, with the air of a man who declines to\r\npursue an utterly nonsensical proposition further.\r\n\r\n“Enough,” exclaimed Henry. “What I want to know is where you got that\r\nair-ship?”\r\n\r\n“That’s for you to find out,” replied Mortimer.\r\n\r\n“And I will,” retorted Henry, with growing anger. “That air-ship was\r\nstolen from one of our camps. There’s been a traitor somewhere and that\r\ntraitor I propose to discover.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; if I have to drag the secret out of you by main force.”\r\n\r\n“You certainly stand an excellent chance of doing it!” sneered\r\nMortimer. “This much I’ll tell you, though, so that no innocent person\r\nmay possibly come under suspicion: The air-ship is not stolen property.\r\nIt was built by an honest man and is the property of His Majesty, the\r\nKing.”\r\n\r\nA look of mingled astonishment, incredulity and anger came into Henry’s\r\nface as Mortimer spoke. At the closing words he startled perceptibly.\r\n\r\n“You lie!” he cried.\r\n\r\nQuick as a flash of light, Mortimer’s long, sinewy arm shot across\r\nthe table and closed upon the other’s throat. Henry was a big,\r\nstrongly-built man, but struggle as he would he could not free himself\r\nfrom that vise-like grasp. Over went table and chair, and back they\r\nstaggered to the side of the tent, Mortimer’s death-like grip neither\r\nshaken nor loosened. In an instant Henry’s men recovered from the first\r\nshock of surprise and the whole file rushed in to the rescue of their\r\nchief. The shouts of the men and the sounds of strife reached the\r\noutside of the tent and other men, headed by Captain Robert, rushed in\r\nand lent their aid. The struggle was sharp but brief and, overborne by\r\nnumbers, Mortimer was finally dragged away, a stout rope wound about\r\nhis arms. Dean, too, they seized and secured.\r\n\r\nHenry had been thrown down in the struggle. He rose to his feet, black\r\nin the face and gasping, and staggered against the side of the tent,\r\nhis hands pressed to his throat. Some of the men stood bunched around\r\nMortimer, to restrain any further outbreak; others busied themselves\r\npicking up the various articles scattered around the floor in the\r\nstruggle. Recovered somewhat from the fearful choking, Henry walked\r\nacross the tent, his face working with anger. He confronted Mortimer,\r\nstanding bound amid his captors.\r\n\r\n“Curse you!”\r\n\r\nAnd he struck the prisoner with his open hand full across the face.\r\n\r\nThe blow was a heavy one and would have taken a weaker man off his\r\nfeet. A great shiver of rage convulsed Mortimer’s powerful frame, he\r\nstrained furiously at his bonds and his blue eyes blazed with fury as\r\nhe glared into the dark face of his opponent.\r\n\r\n“You hound! Should we ever meet face to face, you’ll pay for that with\r\nyour life!” he muttered between his teeth.\r\n\r\nA furious retort was upon the lips of Henry, when Captain Robert\r\nabruptly interposed.\r\n\r\n“You dare to interfere!” cried Henry, beside himself.\r\n\r\n“No, but--” and Captain Robert whispered, his face close to that of his\r\nchief. The bystanders caught only the words “treatment of prisoners,”\r\n“general orders” and “High President.”\r\n\r\n“Enough!” broke in Henry, with a violent effort keeping down his rage.\r\n“Take him away. I’ll deal with him later. Take him away, I say, before\r\nI kill him where he stands!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nVALERIE SEEKS NEWS OF THE FASHIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Robert lost no time in carrying out the order thus received to\r\nremove the prisoners. Placing himself between them, he marched from the\r\ntent and hurried down the cañon.\r\n\r\n“I warned you to take matters quietly,” he said reproachfully. “Yet you\r\nseem to have acted like a keg of explosives from the moment you got\r\ninside the tent.”\r\n\r\n“I wish I could find myself face to face with that scoundrel, man to\r\nman, for a few minutes!” retorted Mortimer. “Oh, for a company of the\r\nGuards at my back at this moment and I’d soon teach that fellow and\r\nthose behind him here a lesson. Prisoners or dead he said they would be\r\nshortly. I’d show him that these same Guards were very much alive!”\r\n\r\n“Prisoners or dead, eh?” repeated Robert. “Did he tell you that?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Mortimer impatiently.\r\n\r\n“He spoke only the truth,” said Robert solemnly.\r\n\r\nDean started. This was the second time within a few minutes he had\r\nheard this declaration and the man who now uttered it spoke earnestly\r\nand with conviction. In Mortimer the words created nothing save\r\nirritation and impatience. The idea of a body of bandits, or other\r\nruffians, talking of annihilating the famous Guards--one of the crack\r\nregiments of the world. It was too preposterous!\r\n\r\n“Are you afflicted, too?” he asked with contempt. “But never mind\r\nthat! What’s this body of men here? We are at least entitled to know to\r\nwhom we are prisoners.”\r\n\r\nThey had come to the end of the cañon and had reached the main valley.\r\nRobert led in sharp turn to the right and kept along parallel with the\r\nbase of the mountain.\r\n\r\n“I may not answer your questions,” he replied, “but unless I am much\r\nmistaken, there will shortly arrive here one high in authority with\r\nwhom you will talk. This air-ship of yours must be reported at once. It\r\nis the most momentous thing which could have happened.”\r\n\r\n“Why so? And who is this one high in authority of whom you speak?”\r\nasked Mortimer.\r\n\r\nRobert parried his question with the query:\r\n\r\n“Suppose you tell me where you got your air-ship? Did you secure it\r\nfrom one of our camps?”\r\n\r\n“That ruffian back there has already asked me that,” replied Mortimer,\r\n“and I told him that it wasn’t stolen, as he seemed to think, from any\r\nof your people, but was the legitimate property of His Majesty, the\r\nKing.”\r\n\r\n“Then it was sold to the royalists by some renegade of our party,”\r\nexclaimed Robert excitedly.\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” replied Mortimer. “There you’re quite wrong.”\r\n\r\n“Who built it, then? Have you any more such ships?” continued Robert\r\nwith the same avidity.\r\n\r\n“Steady, now!” replied Mortimer, smiling at the other’s eagerness.\r\n“You’re not particularly liberal in the matter of information and we’re\r\nnot generous, either,” he added with sarcasm, “after the treatment we\r\nhave experienced here.”\r\n\r\n“For that,” replied Robert humbly, “I ask your pardon in my behalf\r\nand in behalf of many others here who will learn and not approve of\r\nwhat has been done. The Colonel is a hard man--a brutal man, if you\r\nwill--but a highly capable one. Hence he is in command here. Blood will\r\nhave to be shed so that our cause may prevail, but the great mass of us\r\nare, I may truly say, opposed to any unnecessary violence.”\r\n\r\n“You speak strangely,” said Mortimer.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it may so seem to you,” replied Robert, “but it’s nevertheless\r\ntrue. When the hour comes we shall strike, to the full extent that may\r\nbe necessary, but not one step beyond that. Those are the orders--the\r\norders of the High President.”\r\n\r\n“The High President!” exclaimed Mortimer, coming to a dead stop. “Ah!\r\nI see--I see! I’ve heard that title before. This--this--camp is a camp\r\nof Reactionists and you--you--you--are rebels--conspirators against the\r\nKing!”\r\n\r\n“Hush!” said Robert warningly.\r\n\r\n“You deny it!” cried Mortimer.\r\n\r\n“I affirm or deny nothing!” replied Robert. “I’ve already said too\r\nmuch. Come, let us move on.” He touched Mortimer lightly on the arm.\r\n\r\nThey walked a short distance further on down the valley, to a large\r\ncircular opening between the mountains, where a singular sight\r\nconfronted them. In that great circular valley, moored to right and\r\nleft, like shipping in a harbor, lay some two dozen air-ships of\r\nvarying sizes. In the foremost rank were the four great ships which had\r\neffected their capture, and nestling behind these four was their own\r\ncraft, the “Royal Dean.” Here and there men at work were moving about\r\namong the ships.\r\n\r\nSilently they stared for a moment upon the scene before them.\r\n\r\n“I would much like to inspect some of these,” whispered Dean to Robert.\r\n“May I?”\r\n\r\n“I hardly think I have authority to grant you that privilege,” replied\r\nRobert, smiling, “but _your_ ship will doubtless be subjected to very\r\ncareful scrutiny by us. By the way, is there anything about it that\r\nrequires attention for the moment?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” replied Dean; “everything is automatically controlled and it\r\ncan remain as it is for a month without injury.”\r\n\r\n“Did you take part in fitting it up?” asked Robert curiously.\r\n\r\n“For any and all information,” replied Dean, with a laugh, “I must\r\nrefer you to Captain Mortimer.”\r\n\r\nRobert good-naturedly joined in the laugh against himself and led the\r\nway on board one of the larger air-ships. This air-ship was supplied\r\nwith quite a spacious cabin and into this cabin Robert showed his\r\nprisoners, unbinding the ropes which confined their arms.\r\n\r\n“This will have to be your dungeon cell for the present,” he said,\r\nwith a wave of the hand around the cabin, “and I think you will agree\r\nit might be worse. For my part, I’ll do all in my power to make you as\r\ncomfortable as possible. We have a very fair commissariat department, I\r\nthink you’ll find, and I’ll at least see to it that you’re well looked\r\nafter in that direction. My quarters are quite close to yours and\r\nwhatever is prepared for my daughter and myself you shall share.”\r\n\r\n“Your daughter,” repeated Mortimer. “Was that the lady whom we saw when\r\nwe landed?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Robert; “my only child. The organization here sought\r\nme because of my knowledge of mechanics which rendered me useful in\r\nconnection with these air-ships. I would never have consented to come,\r\nthough, if it had meant separation from my girl, so they agreed to\r\nher coming with me. She’s a great favorite here. They call her ‘The\r\nDaughter of the Regiment.’ But, while I am talking away to you, I\r\nexpect you are pretty hungry.”\r\n\r\n“I confess to experiencing a sense of vacuum,” said the Professor.\r\n\r\n“I’m as hungry as a bear,” said Mortimer.\r\n\r\n“Then your wants in that respect shall be quickly supplied,” replied\r\nRobert cheerily. “In the meantime you’ll forgive me, I know, if I\r\nsecure this door on the outside and put a man on guard. That’s the\r\nusual military process, I believe, Captain?”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” answered Mortimer, with a laugh. “I promise you not to\r\nescape during the next hour--not until after breakfast.”\r\n\r\n“And your sword,” said Robert, glancing at the scabbard which hung by\r\nMortimer’s side. “I suppose, according to strict military rule, I ought\r\nto demand that you give it up.”\r\n\r\nMortimer’s face darkened.\r\n\r\n“I served through the Russian war,” he said, “and was never taken\r\nprisoner. To yield up my sword would be a new experience to me. I’ll\r\nyield it to none here, and those who would have it must take it by\r\nforce.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” answered Robert in a conciliatory tone, “we needn’t quarrel\r\nover that. We hold you securely enough here as it is and can afford to\r\nleave you your sword.”\r\n\r\nWith these words, he stepped from the cabin, secured the door on the\r\noutside and the two prisoners were alone. Instinctively they turned and\r\nfaced each other.\r\n\r\n“A pretty mess we’ve made of it!” exclaimed Mortimer, with a laugh.\r\n“We started out to capture those fellows and here they’ve turned the\r\ntables and captured us. A nice little ambuscade we’ve walked, or rather\r\nflown, into. The worst of it, too, is that I thought it was only a\r\nnight’s work and I didn’t even get leave of absence from the Guard--all\r\nof which is quite an infraction of military discipline.”\r\n\r\n“And I,” bewailed the Professor, “what a mess I’ve made of it!\r\nNever once in the excitement of the chase did I think of using the\r\naërestograph to communicate with our friend Kearns. You see, I was kept\r\npretty busy handling the air-ship and keeping watch on the movements of\r\nthe fellows in front of us. Still, I suppose I ought to have managed to\r\nsend him a message or two.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” replied Mortimer; “you were not to blame. Up to the\r\nmoment of our capture what news was there to send? We were every moment\r\nawaiting developments.”\r\n\r\n“And when those developments occurred,” remarked the Professor dryly,\r\n“it was no longer in our power to send messages.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so,” assented Mortimer, “but all that happened was so utterly\r\nunlooked for that we could hardly have been expected to foresee it.\r\nThose who are disposed to criticise may be reminded of the old axiom\r\nthat foresight is never equal to hindsight.”\r\n\r\n“Quite true,” answered the Professor, “but what can you suggest as the\r\nbest way out of our present position? What shall we do?”\r\n\r\nThere was a sound at the door, as of someone at work on the outer\r\nfastenings.\r\n\r\n“Nothing--until after breakfast,” replied Mortimer. “Ah, here it comes,\r\nI think--and welcome.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the door opened and there appeared, at the head of the\r\nsteps leading down into the cabin, the graceful figure of a girl\r\ncarrying a large tray substantially laden with food. At a glance they\r\nrecognized her as she whom they had seen upon landing.\r\n\r\nProfessor Dean rose and bowed.\r\n\r\n“Miss Robert, I believe?” said Captain Mortimer, also rising and bowing.\r\n\r\nThe girl deposited her heavy tray, ran over to a locker and procured a\r\nwhite tablecloth which she spread upon the table.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she replied, with a merry laugh, “but here in the camp they call\r\nme ‘Valerie.’”\r\n\r\nAnd she turned a pair of merry brown eyes upon them, eyes that rested\r\nwith evident admiration on Mortimer’s jaunty military jacket, with its\r\ngay trappings. As she stood there smiling, with her high color, her\r\njet-black hair, her graceful figure, and large but very white teeth\r\nshowing between her full, scarlet lips, she was unquestionably a very\r\npretty girl.\r\n\r\n“Valerie,” repeated Mortimer, gallantly. “That is certainly a very\r\npretty name, but a rather uncommon one in this country.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” assented Valerie, still laughing, as she busied herself with the\r\ntable; “I suppose it is. My mother was French and I was named after\r\nher. They tell me you come direct from the palace,” she prattled on.\r\n“Are any of the ladies there called Valerie?”\r\n\r\n“I think not,” replied Mortimer, joining in her merry mood. “It would\r\nbe hard, even at Court, to find a name as pretty as that.”\r\n\r\n“And is it true that the ladies are wearing dresses cut in Directoire\r\nstyle?” continued Valerie.\r\n\r\nMortimer broke into a hearty laugh.\r\n\r\n“Really,” he said, “I am not competent to answer that. Perhaps,” he\r\nadded mischievously, “my friend Professor Dean, who takes a great\r\ninterest in the ladies, can inform you upon that subject.”\r\n\r\nThus appealed to, the Professor fairly blushed.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he stammered confusedly, “I don’t know much about ladies’\r\ndresses, but it is true that the fashions have reverted to something\r\nlike that which was in vogue some two centuries ago and the ladies at\r\nthe Court to-day are wearing dresses which suggest those of the days of\r\nthe French _Directoire_.”\r\n\r\n“There!” exclaimed Mortimer triumphantly. “You see he is an authority\r\nand I referred you to the right source for information.”\r\n\r\n“It must be a very pretty fashion,” remarked the girl musingly. “How I\r\nwould like to see those dresses--and the Court and the ladies there!\r\nWhat a pity it seems that a Court is wicked and must be done away with.”\r\n\r\n“What makes you think the Court is wicked?” asked Mortimer curiously.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” replied the girl, “I have always been taught that. Everybody\r\nhere says it is. But I am keeping you from your breakfast,” she added,\r\nhastily.\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” protested Mortimer and the Professor together. “Pray\r\nstay.”\r\n\r\n“No; I must go,” she replied regretfully. “I was specially told I must\r\nnot talk much to you and if I stay too long, father will suspect and\r\nnot let me come again, and,” she added with a saucy smile and a final\r\nadmiring glance at Mortimer’s uniform, as she fled up the steps, “I\r\n_want_ to come again.”\r\n\r\nAs the door closed behind her the Professor turned to Mortimer.\r\n\r\n“They say that every woman is at heart a royalist and I verily believe\r\nthis very attractive young woman has a leaning that way.”\r\n\r\n“The saying is a very true one,” replied Mortimer. “From what little\r\nI have read and observed on the subject, I should say that the\r\nwomen--God bless them!--had much to do, by indirect but nevertheless\r\npowerful influence, with the formation of the monarchy, and womankind\r\nto-day is to be reckoned as one of the staunchest supports of the\r\nthrone.”\r\n\r\nAnd with this summary of the situation, he turned with interest to the\r\nbreakfast before them.\r\n\r\nThey spent the remainder of the morning and afternoon in arguing over\r\nvarious measures and plans of escape. There was a sentinel, they knew,\r\nconstantly on duty outside the cabin door, and should they break out\r\nand confront this man there were doubtless plenty of his comrades at\r\nhand to come to his assistance before an escape could be made. From\r\nwhat little they had seen of the valley they had perceived that it was\r\napparently enclosed on all sides by high, precipitous mountains, which\r\nwould take much time and effort to scale and would afford excellent\r\nopportunities for pursuit and recapture. Any clumsy and unsuccessful\r\neffort at escape would naturally lead to greater vigilance on the part\r\nof their captors. They were both agreed that they must be patient for\r\nthe moment and watch for some favorable opportunity before venturing an\r\nattempt.\r\n\r\nTheir dinner was brought them by Valerie, who stayed longer than\r\nbefore, chatting gayly and coquetting at a lively rate with Mortimer.\r\nAfter dinner they received a visit from Captain Robert, who came with a\r\nbundle under his arm.\r\n\r\n“I cannot offer you cigars,” he said, “for there is a shortage of those\r\nluxuries here, but I can give you some excellent tobacco.” He took the\r\nbundle from under his arm and laid upon the table some long clay pipes\r\nand a stone jar filled with tobacco.\r\n\r\n“There’s a great consumption of pipes among our people,” he said, “and\r\nwe manufacture these ourselves--both the long and the short variety.”\r\n\r\nThe Professor smiled.\r\n\r\n“You seem to have extensive facilities for various kinds of\r\nmanufacturing,” he remarked with meaning.\r\n\r\nCaptain Robert laughed outright.\r\n\r\n“I’m not going to give you any information on that point,” he said,\r\n“but I can tell you something of interest.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“The news of your capture and of your air-ship,” continued Captain\r\nRobert, “has been forwarded to headquarters and it seems to have made,\r\nas I predicted, quite a stir.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! is that all!” answered the Professor, with some disappointment.\r\n\r\n“By no means,” replied Robert. “A certain important personage is on his\r\nway here. To-morrow you will receive a visit.”\r\n\r\n“From whom?” inquired Dean curiously.\r\n\r\nThe other dropped his voice to a whisper:\r\n\r\n“From the High President himself!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE MASKED VISITOR\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was close upon noon on the following day when Captain Robert\r\npresented himself before the prisoners. He was eager and excited.\r\n\r\n“Are you ready to receive the visit I spoke of last night?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” exclaimed Mortimer, with a slight show of interest, “is His\r\nMightiness, your famous High President, here?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Robert; “he arrived just before daylight and has been\r\nbusy during the morning around the camp.”\r\n\r\n“Arrived before daylight!” repeated Mortimer. “Your High President is\r\nan early traveler.”\r\n\r\n“Those who come to this camp,” answered Robert gravely, “invariably\r\narrive before daylight. I don’t think I’ll betray any very special\r\ninformation if I tell you in confidence that he was picked up at a\r\ndistant point from here and arrived by air-ship.”\r\n\r\n“That’s just what I surmised when you first spoke,” said Dean quickly.\r\n\r\n“Then your surmise was quite correct,” replied Robert. “He arrived and\r\nhe will leave by air-ship. Are you ready to receive him?”\r\n\r\nMortimer and the Professor both assented and Robert started for the\r\ncabin steps. But he stopped and again turned to them.\r\n\r\n“I know nothing definitely,” he said, “but I strongly suspect the\r\ninterview you are about to hold will be a most important one. I have\r\nyour welfare at heart. I beg you to receive the High President in the\r\nright spirit and to give due heed to his words.”\r\n\r\n“I thank you,” said the Professor appreciatively.\r\n\r\n“And I thank you,” exclaimed Mortimer, “but I’ve already had one\r\nunpleasant experience here. Your High President shall be received by\r\nus with due consideration and we will listen carefully to whatever he\r\nmay have to say to us, provided the manner and language adopted are\r\nsuch as may be properly tolerated by a gentleman of the high scientific\r\nattainments of my friend, Professor Dean, and myself, as an officer of\r\nHis Majesty, the King.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” exclaimed Robert enthusiastically, “you need have no fear on that\r\nscore. Don’t for a moment compare the High President with anyone you\r\nhave seen here. The High President is a man of the highest culture and\r\nof the highest calibre. He is the most God-like man who has lived since\r\nthe days of Washington--a leader gifted with genius for organization,\r\na patriot who seeks nothing except for his countrymen; brave,\r\nenterprising, resourceful, merciless when the occasion demands it, yet\r\nwith a heart full of love for humanity--such is our High President. He\r\nwill go down to posterity as the greatest patriot and leader of men of\r\nthe centuries.”\r\n\r\nRobert’s eyes blazed with enthusiasm as he spoke and his manner was\r\nfull of earnestness.\r\n\r\n“We will bear your words in mind,” said the Professor. “He is doubtless\r\nvery worthy, since you estimate him so highly.”\r\n\r\n“And you--what say you?” asked Robert, turning questioningly to\r\nMortimer.\r\n\r\n“I can hardly be expected to subscribe to your views,” answered\r\nMortimer coldly, “inasmuch as I have reason to suspect the person to\r\nwhom you refer to be engaged in an organized and armed rebellion\r\nagainst the government and to be an enemy to the King.”\r\n\r\nRobert stood for a moment looking sadly into Mortimer’s face and then,\r\nwithout another word, withdrew.\r\n\r\nSome ten minutes later the door again opened and looking up they\r\nsaw Robert. He stepped back, opened the door to its fullest extent\r\nand there appeared a man tall of stature and of massive physique.\r\nWith movements which were remarkably rapid for one of such giant\r\nproportions, he passed down the cabin steps and stood before them.\r\n\r\nBoth Mortimer and Dean looked up with a start of astonishment.\r\n\r\nTheir visitor was masked.\r\n\r\n“Greeting!” he exclaimed, as he stood facing them, using the common\r\nform of salutation of the day. Long ago the Professor had duly noted\r\nthat the comparatively meaningless “Good-morning!” and “Good-day!”\r\nof the olden times had passed into disuse; as had also that almost\r\npathetic expression at parting: “Good-bye!” They were as obsolete\r\nas the “Good-morrow!” of the eighteenth century. People now said\r\n“Greeting!” or “Salutations!” or “I salute you!” when they met and\r\n“Re-meeting!” when they parted--thereby intending to courteously convey\r\nthe idea that they looked forward with anticipation and pleasure to\r\nagain meeting the person from whom they were taking leave. “To our\r\njoyous re-meeting!” Surely a happier salutation than the old-time sad\r\n“Good-bye!”\r\n\r\n“We greet you!” responded Mortimer, in turn using the customary form of\r\nsalutation.\r\n\r\n“I trust you have been well cared for,” continued the visitor, “and\r\nthat your detention has been made as comfortable as circumstances would\r\npermit.”\r\n\r\n“With the exception of a dastardly insult received from him who appears\r\nto be in chief command here,” replied Mortimer, flushing with anger at\r\nthe recollections of the event, “we have received every kindness and\r\ncourtesy.”\r\n\r\nThe visitor waved his hand deprecatingly.\r\n\r\n“The matter has been reported to me,” he said, “and you may rely upon\r\nit that I have severely reprimanded the offender. Only the existence\r\nof an extraordinary exigency has prevented the summary removal of the\r\nofficer. Such action, I beg to assure you, is entirely contrary to the\r\nspirit and rules of our organization.”\r\n\r\n“Then I accept your explanation,” answered Mortimer. “I’ll only hold\r\nthe man himself responsible for his act. Let us put that matter aside\r\nand pass on to other subjects. I wish to know what is this organization\r\nassembled here that has dared to hold in detention my friend and\r\nmyself, both in the service of His Majesty, the King.”\r\n\r\nThe visitor threw back his head proudly and answered without a moment’s\r\nhesitation.\r\n\r\n“You may have experienced some reticence on that subject from those\r\nabout you,” he said, “for it is well that subordinates should be\r\ntrained to caution and to secrecy, but I have no hesitation in\r\nsatisfying your inquiry. You are prisoners by the right of Might--the\r\nparamount right in the affairs of this world--and the body to which you\r\nare prisoners is the Federated Nihilists of America.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, Nihilists!” exclaimed Mortimer.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” was the reply; “commonly but very inaccurately referred to by\r\nyou of the Court as ‘Reactionists.’”\r\n\r\n“And you,” said Mortimer; “you are the High President?”\r\n\r\n“I am the High President.”\r\n\r\nThere was a momentary pause and Mortimer again spoke.\r\n\r\n“Then, may I ask of you,” he said, “as the head of this organization,\r\nwhat are your plans concerning us? Is this detention to last\r\nindefinitely, or have you any terms to offer us?”\r\n\r\n“Let us be seated,” answered the High President. “I have much to say\r\nto you and much may depend upon our conference. I see that you have\r\nsmoking materials on the table. Pray smoke, if it please you, and if\r\nyou think it will add calmness and wisdom to our deliberations.”\r\n\r\nProfessor Dean had thus far not uttered a single word. There was a\r\nstrange straining and puzzling going on in his mind. Certain accents\r\nin the voice of the High President struck upon his ear with a strange\r\nfamiliarity. Where before had he heard that voice? Was it among some\r\nof those whom he had recently met, or was it merely a resemblance\r\nconveying a suggestion of his former life--of the long ago?\r\n\r\nThey took their seats about the table and faced each other for a\r\nmoment. Then the High President spoke.\r\n\r\n“As I have told you,” he said, “this body is known as the Federated\r\nNihilists of America--a body which you, Captain Mortimer, have\r\ndoubtless now and again vaguely heard referred to as ‘The\r\nReactionists.’ Nothing could be more inaccurate, or misleading, than\r\nthis term, inasmuch as the entire spirit of our organization is\r\ndirectly opposed to reaction. The royalists call us ‘Reactionists’\r\nbecause they believe our aim is to upset the monarchical establishment\r\nand revert to the former Republic. Nothing could be more wrong, and I\r\nsay to you frankly that between the Monarchy of to-day and the old-time\r\nRepublic, as it existed prior to the crowning of the first American\r\nKing, the Monarchy is the better institution.”\r\n\r\n“If you admit that,” said Mortimer argumentatively, “what is it you\r\nseek to attain?”\r\n\r\n“That which the title of our organization implies,” replied the High\r\nPresident. “We style ourselves Nihilists and, as you know, the word\r\nNihil is from the Latin and signifies ‘Nothing.’ First, existing\r\ninstitutions must be wiped out--reduced to nothing--before we can build\r\nup the new. Our aim is to extinguish--to annihilate--to destroy--not\r\nonly the existing monarchy, not only all relics and customs which have\r\nbeen handed down to us from the Republic preceding that monarchy, but\r\nall existing institutions. We regard these existing institutions as so\r\nunsatisfactory, so corrupt, so vile that it would be a useless task to\r\nseek to better them. You will never reach a given point, no matter how\r\nyou may press onward or take turns to the right or to the left, if you\r\nare on entirely the wrong road. So it is with existing institutions.\r\nThe conditions are so utterly and hopelessly wrong that it is a useless\r\ntask to seek to improve them. The only recourse is to wipe everything\r\nout and build up entirely anew.”\r\n\r\n“Wasn’t that idea formulated in Russia a long time ago?” asked Mortimer\r\nthoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“The idea was agitated in Russia over a century ago,” replied the High\r\nPresident, “and its advocates prosecuted in a more or less crude and\r\nbarbarous fashion their ideas and their plans. It does not follow that\r\nbecause an idea is old, it is devoid of merit. On the contrary, nearly\r\nall the great ideas and movements in this world have been in existence\r\na long time--have been old--before the world has finally accepted\r\nthem. The soil of Russia, however, never was a suitable soil for the\r\ncultivation of the plant of Liberty. Here in the broad, free American\r\nair, Liberty will flourish and give to mankind a new and happier era.\r\nOur Nihilism, while founded upon the same basic principle, is in its\r\npractical workings upon a far more scientific foundation. It is a\r\nNihilism brought down to the requirements and the civilization of the\r\ntwentieth century.”\r\n\r\n“And you really think this Nihilism of yours, with its Russian origin\r\nand its later-day modifications and improvements as worked out by you,\r\nbetter for the American people than the Monarchy?” asked Mortimer.\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly,” answered the High President. “The American atmosphere\r\nand the genius of the American people are not really suited to a\r\nmonarchy, although thanks to the trend of peculiar circumstances those\r\nforces here which favor that form of government--and I will admit they\r\nare by no means few or lacking in influence and power--have for the\r\ntime being the upper hand. The real mission, however, of Americans,\r\nwith all their faults and foibles, is to teach the world at large new\r\nand greater forms of liberty and human happiness, ever growing grander\r\nand greater throughout the successive cycles of time.”\r\n\r\n“And you think your Nihilism better suited for the American people than\r\na republic, such as that which was supplanted by the present Monarchy?”\r\nsaid Professor Dean, who had been an attentive listener and who now for\r\nthe first time joined in the conversation. “Ah, sir, I have heard you\r\nrefer with striking disparagement to that Republic. I would gladly have\r\nyou give some reasons for these views!”\r\n\r\n“Bah!” exclaimed the High President contemptuously, “the old-time\r\nRepublic, eh! Could anything more evil, corrupt, hypocritical, farcical\r\nand criminal exist under the sun than that old-time Republic of yours?\r\nAll modern thinkers, writers and sociologists are agreed as to that.\r\nYou have heard me say that of the two the present monarchy was the\r\nbetter institution, and I spoke advisedly.”\r\n\r\n“What--what!” stammered the Professor, fairly taken aback at the\r\ndirectness and violence of the attack. “Your reasons, sir--your\r\nreasons!”\r\n\r\n“Reasons?” repeated the High President. “They will not be hard to\r\ngive. To-day we have only one King. He is great and rich and powerful,\r\nso much so that he need seek no further self-advantages but may rest\r\ncontent with all that which is his. He need have an eye only to the\r\nwelfare of his nation and his people. We have an aristocracy, too;\r\nalso great and rich, so much so that they can well afford to lay\r\nself-interest aside and seek public life with a view solely to the\r\ngreater glory of their country. There are exceptions to this, of\r\ncourse, but I speak of our aristocracy as a class. Then, too, our\r\naristocrats of to-day have been aristocrats for a sufficient time to\r\nbe at least free from the shortcomings, the arrogance and the vices\r\nwhich have ever marked the _parvenu_. Now let us look at the old-time\r\nRepublic!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” exclaimed the Professor, bending forward in his eagerness.\r\n\r\n“The old-time Republic,” continued the High President, “had not one\r\nking but many. You had not a monarch--serene and majestic, clothed\r\nin the royal purple, bearing the sceptre and crown and surrounded by\r\nthe glitter and the glory of an imperial court. Instead, the land was\r\ndivided up among a parcel of little rulers--men mostly of low origin\r\nand ignoble ideals--who really exercised kingly power. Take your proud\r\nEmpire State of New York--a state as broad, as rich and as populous\r\nas some of the great empires of Europe. Two little kings reigned\r\nthere--the one, a small, shrivelled, old man who divided his time\r\nbetween the handling of parcels and the pulling of political wires;\r\nthe other a beetle-browed, sullen ruler, whose brutal hands, reeking\r\nwith crime and corruption, were ever stretched forth to grasp further\r\nplunder.”\r\n\r\n“By heaven!” exclaimed Mortimer, “was it really as bad as that!”\r\n\r\n“I am quoting to you almost literally from the chronicles of the\r\ntimes,” replied the High President. “These two little kings absolutely\r\nruled the state between them. It was at their royal behest that\r\ngovernors were nominated and elected, legislators selected and judges\r\nput upon the bench. When any opposition to their respective rules\r\nappeared to threaten them, they promptly joined forces, fought shoulder\r\nto shoulder and, under prearranged agreement, divided the subsequent\r\nplunder. Behind them was an armed banditti of many thousand men, known\r\nas a police force and supposed to be organized for the protection\r\nand enforcement of law and order. As a matter of fact, this force\r\nwas nothing less than an organized body of ravishers and despoilers,\r\npreying upon the people and levying tribute right and left. It is safe\r\nto say that the operations of all the banditti since the beginning of\r\nthe Christian era, nor any invading army, ever equaled in the amount of\r\nloot secured the operations of the force I speak of which stood behind\r\nthese two kings.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” exclaimed Mortimer; “things must have been pretty bad in\r\nyour Republic, Professor!”\r\n\r\nDean lowered his eyes as one who is ashamed.\r\n\r\n“There is much that is correct in all this,” he said; “much that I\r\ncannot truthfully contradict. But proceed.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, and proceed I will,” replied the High President stoutly. “The\r\naristocracy which surrounded these kings--that is, the men who formed\r\ntheir courts and helped to administer the public affairs--were in\r\nmany instances vulgar publicans; men who derived their incomes by the\r\nmaintenance of groggeries and low dancing houses, or worse--gamblers,\r\ntouts, and a sprinkling of ex-convicts and little lawyers. Such was\r\nthe aristocracy and the environment of these kings--the men who really\r\nruled the land. I have spoken so far of the proud Empire State of New\r\nYork. If you turn to the East or to the South, the middle country or\r\nthe West, you will find that much the same conditions prevailed. Deny\r\nit, if you can!”\r\n\r\n“I think,” protested the Professor, “that your criticism is, perhaps,\r\ndirected into too narrow channels and that it treats too much of\r\ncertain phases of mere partisan, or local politics.”\r\n\r\n“But was not each State sovereign and independent,” retorted the High\r\nPresident, “and did not each State make its own laws and govern itself\r\ngenerally? Then, too, how was the Federal government itself made up\r\nexcept from the combined selections of the different States?”\r\n\r\n“Still,” persisted the Professor, “I think that your criticism might be\r\ndirected toward more broad and general conditions of our national life.”\r\n\r\n“That, too, I will do since you have demanded it,” replied the High\r\nPresident. “Let us go back to the days of almost primeval man. What did\r\nthe chief of the tribe, or band, do? He parcelled out the best of the\r\nplunder, or possessions, among his strongest fighting men, or else\r\namong the priests, or medicine men, or whoever was equally powerful\r\nwith the fighting men in his particular way. Take it again in feudal\r\nEngland. What did the feudal Kings do there after the Norman Conquest?\r\nThey divided the best lands of the country among the powerful Barons\r\nwho formed their Court. And so it was in your Republic. The good things\r\nof the land--the great public franchises--were all parcelled out to\r\nthese modern feudal Barons who waxed fat and built their wealth into\r\nthe millions upon that which had been given them at the expense of the\r\npeople.”\r\n\r\n“But there were, I remember, various objections raised,” said the\r\nProfessor, “to any other course being adopted--such as government\r\nownership.”\r\n\r\n“Objections!” exclaimed the High President contemptuously; “objections\r\ncan be raised to anything. The murderer doubtless has his objections to\r\nthe gallows and the thief strongly objects to the jail. There was at\r\nleast one shining example of government ownership in those days. Was\r\nthere anything so reliable or so admirably administered as the public\r\nmails--entirely conducted by the government? How is it possible in a\r\ntrue Republic to contemplate that which belongs to the public being\r\ngiven away for the benefit and enrichment of the few and the public\r\ncorrespondingly robbed to that extent.”\r\n\r\n“And yet,” remarked the Professor, “in spite of these criticisms which\r\nyou make, it seemed to be generally admitted that our people under the\r\nRepublic had better reason to be contented than the people of any other\r\nnation on the face of the globe.”\r\n\r\n“And so they had the right to expect to be,” retorted the High\r\nPresident, “but surely what you advance is no argument. Ought the\r\npeople here to be satisfied merely because they are comparatively\r\nbetter off than the people of Scandinavia and the people of Scandinavia\r\nin turn be well content because they are comparatively better off than\r\nthe people of the interior of China? But let us look further into the\r\nquestion as to how well the people under the Republic were contented.\r\nWere they really contented, or did they individually accept existing\r\nconditions because they could discover no particular way of changing\r\nthem? Do you think that the average man among the great masses of the\r\npeople was satisfied to work all his life for a pittance which was\r\ninsufficient in most instances to fully furnish him, year in and year\r\nout, with the actual necessaries of life and see another man, of the\r\nsame clay as himself, who could afford to squander aimlessly in one day\r\nupon an old bit of cracked porcelain, a piece of painted canvas, or\r\nsome drab of the footlights, whose complexion was as false as her soul,\r\nas much money as that other man earned in a lifetime. And yet the one\r\nman was, perhaps, fully as well endowed physically and mentally as the\r\nother and the life work of the one was fully as useful to the community\r\nas the work of the other. Why, then, this awful disparity? Do you know,\r\ntoo, that statistics show that of ten adults dying under your vaunted\r\nRepublic, nine went out of this world subjects for Potter’s Field? I do\r\nnot mean by this that they were actually so interred, for the love and\r\nrespect of friends who lent their aid usually saved them from this, but\r\nI do mean that nine out of ten died without leaving sufficient behind\r\nthem, after a lifetime of honest, unremitting toil, to actually pay\r\ntheir burial expenses.”\r\n\r\n“I was unaware of that,” said the Professor, “and it certainly is a\r\nshocking disclosure.”\r\n\r\n“Shocking, indeed!” retorted the High President. “I do not think\r\nthere is any disputing that. And do you believe that the people were\r\nsatisfied on the land question? It does not require any great depth of\r\nlearning in political economy to know that the source of all wealth is\r\nthe land. All that which we have is either taken from the earth, or\r\nelse is grown upon or fed from the surface of the earth. Is it to be\r\nbelieved that God put the minerals, the oil, the coal into the earth\r\nfor the benefit of an exclusive few, or that he put them there for the\r\njoint and common benefit of the masses of mankind? Did He make the\r\nsurface of the earth fruitful and send the showers and the sunshine,\r\nwhich alone enable it to fructify, for the benefit of a chosen few,\r\nor for the common benefit of all? That the former was the case seems\r\nto have been the theory which prevailed under the Republic, for we\r\nfind that the great bulk of the land was owned by the comparative\r\nfew. Do you think the masses of the great cities were individually\r\nsatisfied that acre upon acre of city blocks should be owned by certain\r\nfamilies to whom all those dwelling in those blocks paid a heavy rent\r\ntribute year in, year out--a tribute amounting upon an average from\r\none-fourth to one-third of the total income earned? What substantial\r\ndifference was there between this and mediæval feudalism? And what did\r\nthose land-cornerers do with the vast surplus sums accumulated from\r\nthe tribute wrung from those rent slaves? The chronicles show that\r\nthey cast about them for communities as yet in their incipiency but\r\npresenting possibilities of growing into populous centres of activity.\r\nIn these growing communities, these land-gluttons bought up the best\r\nportions of realty, which they let lie for the time being, unused\r\nand unimproved, paying merely the low tax imposed upon unimproved\r\nproperty. The community was built up by the enterprise, the labor and\r\nthe efforts of the masses; it grew into a city and became populous;\r\nits land became valuable. When their vacant lots had acquired value\r\nthrough the efforts of the people--efforts in which they had in no way\r\nparticipated--these land-cornerers put up structures and proceeded with\r\nthe old game of levying the rent tribute. If ever there was an instance\r\nof unjust enrichment, it was this.”\r\n\r\nThe Professor remained thoughtfully silent.\r\n\r\n“Talk not to me of the old-time Republic,” continued the High\r\nPresident; “it died because of its innate rottenness--because of the\r\napathy of its people--and the littleness and corruption of its public\r\nmen. Look at the infamous record of your Food Trusts, which forced up\r\nthe prices of many articles of food so that they were beyond the reach\r\nof the great mass of the poorer people. Contemplate the Coal Trust,\r\nwhose directing powers first advanced, under the Republic, the hitherto\r\nexclusively monarchical claim of Divine Right, and proceeded to\r\nmanipulate the coal supply so that citizens of the Republic were frozen\r\nto death, while thousands of unknown and unrecorded others undoubtedly\r\nperished from diseases incurred as a result of insufficient warmth. The\r\nunfortunate poor might have derived a little benefit by burning oil,\r\nbut what did the eminent citizen of that day do who, while not claiming\r\nto be God’s anointed, yet had contrived to absorb all the oil of the\r\ncountry? Why, he promptly took advantage of the situation and raised\r\nthe price of oil. It is true that at the same time he, with reckless\r\ngenerosity, contributed some ten thousand dollars to a benevolent\r\nenterprise, but in the meantime he had pocketed a cool million by\r\nthe advancement of the price of his commodity. Here was a million\r\nwrung out of the sufferings of God’s poor and a sop of ten thousand\r\ndollars thrown out to hoodwink and propitiate the Almighty. What must\r\nhave been the Deity’s sentiments over this estimate of the financial\r\nperspicacity which sought to deceive him by such a ruse--a ruse which\r\nwould have been apparent to the intelligence of the dullest office-boy\r\nemployed in a commercial institution!”\r\n\r\n“All those events were duly criticised at the time,” murmured the\r\nProfessor, “and came in for their share of censure.”\r\n\r\n“Criticism--censure!” exclaimed the High President with disgust. “But\r\nwhat did the people do? Did they seize upon those who withheld the food\r\nand the warmth and rush them to public execution, as did the people of\r\nFrance with their oppressing nobles in the days of the great French\r\nRevolution? No; they did nothing! They waited and stared and suffered\r\nlike dumb cattle driven to the shambles. And the public men of the day?\r\nThey conferred a good deal and they even threatened a little, but--it\r\nwas a very respectful threatening in the face of Mighty Capital. The\r\nChief Magistrate of the Nation in that day was a man still young--a\r\nman strong, vigorous and bold, who had filled various public offices\r\nably and well and had proved himself a brave soldier in the field. He\r\nwas the people’s idol and the people’s hope. There was food in plenty\r\nto be had from other lands, but it was shut out from the people’s use\r\nby an exorbitant protective tariff. Remove this tariff and food would\r\nhave flooded in upon the people in boundless store and the corner\r\nin Monopoly and Death have been crushed out of existence in a week.\r\nCongress held the vested right to do whatsoever might be necessary for\r\nthe welfare or safety of the people and a ringing message, couched in\r\nhis old-time, fearless form, from this Chief Magistrate would have set\r\nthe people throughout the length and breadth of the land ablaze with\r\nenthusiasm. It would have put him beyond the power of any clique or\r\nparty, and would have exalted him to the highest pinnacle of popular\r\nidolatry as the man of the hour, the people’s choice! His party would\r\nnot have dared to say him nay, for individually and alone he would have\r\nstood stronger than his party. It was an opportunity such as rarely\r\ncomes to a ruler. But the voice of the cautious counselors surrounding\r\nhim in his exalted station whispered in his ear: ‘You have been accused\r\nof being too bold, as lacking in conservatism. Do not frighten, or\r\nattack, the great money interests--those representing the sacred and\r\nvested Rights of Capital--lest in their fear they turn and destroy\r\nyou!’ And he hearkened to this counsel. It is true, I believe, that a\r\nmeasure was finally passed temporarily admitting foreign coal free of\r\ntariff charge, but this measure came too late. The President’s brave\r\nheart bled for the people, but his old-time fearlessness forsook him\r\nand he failed them. And when he so failed them, the last hope of the\r\nRepublic went out. The Republic was doomed. The shadows of Plutocracy\r\nand of Monarchy lowered over the land!”\r\n\r\n“And the Monarchy which came was an improvement, you consider, upon the\r\nRepublic which preceded?” asked the Professor.\r\n\r\n“At least in this respect,” answered the High President, “that under a\r\nmonarchy we may reasonably look for class distinction, for great wealth\r\non the one side and for great poverty on the other, but in a true\r\nRepublic, one worthy of the name, such distinction is as unnatural as\r\nit is iniquitous.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, now you are about to criticise the Monarchy, I suspect!” exclaimed\r\nMortimer. “But, pray tell me, is your Nihilism going to cure all these\r\nevils you have portrayed?”\r\n\r\n“You speak of Nihilism,” answered the High President gravely, “as if\r\nit were the beginning and end of the entire programme. As a matter of\r\nfact, Nihilism is only the beginning. As I have told you, we must first\r\nwipe out existing institutions so that we may properly build up a new\r\nCommonwealth, or Republic, founded upon the abolition of industrial\r\nslavery, the brotherhood of man and the more equal apportionment of\r\nbenefits to the race.”\r\n\r\n“But you spoke particularly of the evils of individual land ownership,”\r\npersisted Mortimer. “Would you under your scheme do away with that?”\r\n\r\n“I undoubtedly would,” answered the High President. “It seems to me a\r\nproposition beyond argument that God created the land and all within\r\nit for the benefit of mankind in general and not for the benefit of a\r\ngiven few. The land should no more be owned individually than the air,\r\nor the seas. It should be the property of all and inure to the benefit\r\nof all--in a word, belong to the State. Those using land, either\r\nurban or agricultural, should lease from the State and pay the rent\r\ntribute to the State and the benefits of the land--created by God for\r\nall--would thus inure to the benefit of all.”\r\n\r\n“Would not this tend to accumulate,” suggested the Professor, “too\r\nvast sums in the hands of the State--sums so vast that there would\r\nconstantly be a stringency of money and a consequent business\r\nparalysis?”\r\n\r\n“The answer to that,” replied the High President, “is that the State\r\ncould by magnificent public improvements and in a hundred other\r\nways find means of rapidly disposing of any such surplus it might\r\nacquire. It could, if necessary, pay out dividends to its citizens,\r\nas the big corporations do to their share-holders. This objection\r\nyou have advanced and a thousand others, will ever be urged to any\r\nchange looking to an improvement of things. The people thus opposing\r\nwill be found describing their opposition as Conservatism. The true\r\ndefinition of a Conservatism is a man very well-off, who finds things\r\npre-eminently satisfactory for him as they are and is, therefore,\r\nopposed to any change. Priestcraft, when it held communities and\r\nnations under its subjection, the feudal barons, emperors, kings\r\nand modern plutocrats--these, all these, you will find to have been\r\nstaunch advocates of Conservatism. Did you ever reflect,” continued\r\nthe High President, “upon the inequality and injustice of existing\r\nlaws of property ownership? When a man composes an opera, or indites\r\na book of poems, or writes a novel, or devises some new and useful\r\ninvention, he plays the part of a creator. Out of his own brain alone\r\nthat production has evolved. It did not exist before he gave it birth\r\nand the world is so much the richer. If ever a man can be said to\r\nhave a proprietary right in anything, it is to that property which\r\nactually was evolved from and created by himself alone. Yet, in the\r\ncase of an author, or composer, the Law protects him in that property\r\nright for only twenty-eight years, and in the case of the inventor for\r\nonly seventeen years. After that, their respective productions pass\r\ninto the public domain--become public property. But the man who for a\r\nmere trifle acquires a tract, or parcel, of land--which he certainly\r\nhad no part in creating or putting there--and holds it while a city\r\nbuilds about him and the land is made valuable by the presence and\r\nthe efforts of the community at large--that man owns that land in\r\nperpetuity; it is the property of him and his heirs forever. And the\r\nLaw itself! What a monstrous combination of illogical deduction and\r\nof systematic injustice! The Law! Five years required to adjudicate a\r\ncase which would be sufficiently disposed of in as many hours under\r\nany modern system of businesslike administration--the Law which can\r\nonly be invoked under conditions of expense absurdly disproportionate\r\nto the results. Just think of a system which is supposed to adjudicate\r\nand do substantial justice between man and man and yet which nine men\r\nout of ten in the community will tell you means ruin to resort to! The\r\nLaw in its methods of procedure is a century, or more, behind the times\r\nand the learned and time-honored profession of the Law is, in reality,\r\nthe profession of the modern highwayman. There is no form of modern\r\nevil which more seriously demands the application of the principles of\r\nNihilism than the Law as it to-day exists!”\r\n\r\n“And if your New Republic could be established,” asked Mortimer, “you\r\nwould be in favor of ruthlessly despoiling all the present land owners\r\nof their holdings and escheating these holdings to the State?”\r\n\r\n“That need not necessarily be done,” answered the High President.\r\n“It would be no very difficult matter to assess the land at a fair\r\nvaluation and for the State to pay to the owners thereof a given\r\nannual percentage for say fifty years to come, subject to certain\r\nqualifications. This would result in eventually reimbursing to the\r\nowners far more than they had originally expended and would give them\r\nample time to accommodate themselves to the new condition of things.\r\nOf course, manifold objections, both technical and financial, will\r\nbe urged to the feasibility of this plan--especially by those with\r\ntendencies to Conservatism--but I apprehend there are no obstacles\r\nto its successful execution which cannot be overcome and it would\r\ncertainly be immeasurably superior to the present system. With public\r\nfranchises and the Nation’s land thus inuring to the benefit of the\r\nwhole people, the possibility of building up fortunes of two hundred\r\nand three hundred millions, or even of eight or ten millions, would be\r\ndone away with. Surely this would be no misfortune!”\r\n\r\n“But,” said the Professor, “I have heard the objection raised to plans\r\nof this nature that their adoption would tend to lessen competitive\r\nactivity and deaden men’s energy and ambition generally.”\r\n\r\n“The objection is ill-founded,” replied the High President. “If the\r\nmaximum which a man might hope to attain were fixed at one million, or\r\nless, men would strive just as zealously for the fixed amount as they\r\nwould when the possibilities are unlimited. As it is now, money makes\r\nmoney. It is not so much the billionaire himself who earns as the sheer\r\nweight of money behind him which accomplishes. He is not called upon\r\nto exercise any particular creative effort on his part and, worst of\r\nall, he handicaps the efforts of others more worthy. In any event, the\r\nguiding spirit of our New Republic will be the happiness and welfare\r\nof the many, as against the particular interests and privileges of the\r\nfew.”\r\n\r\n“You have compared the old-time Republic adversely with the existing\r\nMonarchy,” said the Professor, with whom this seemed to be a sore\r\npoint, “yet from the little I have learned it seems to me that the\r\nwrongs of the masses are as great under the monarchy as ever they were\r\nunder the Republic.”\r\n\r\n“To what phase do you refer in particular?” asked the High President.\r\n\r\n“To the matter of their general welfare,” replied the Professor. “For\r\ninstance, I understand that the coal supply is to be cornered this\r\nwinter and immeasurable want and suffering inflicted broadcast.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” exclaimed the High President quickly, “thank God that necessity\r\nwill be obviated!”\r\n\r\n“Indeed! How so?”\r\n\r\n“There have been new developments recently,” replied the High\r\nPresident. “Matters have perfected themselves more rapidly than was\r\nanticipated. There will be no necessity to wait until next winter. The\r\nhour has come! The New Republic is at hand!”\r\n\r\n“The New Republic is at hand!” repeated Mortimer, smiling. “Why,\r\nyou speak of this New Republic of yours almost as if it were an\r\naccomplished fact!”\r\n\r\n“So nearly an accomplished fact,” replied the High President, “that\r\nwithin ten days it will be here!”\r\n\r\nThe words were uttered gravely and impressively. They carried a strange\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Mortimer sat silent, staring at the speaker. Then he\r\nleaned forward in his chair.\r\n\r\n“And the King--the existing form of government!” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“A thing of the past--overthrown!”\r\n\r\n“This is preposterous!” cried Mortimer, a wave of anger flushing his\r\nbrow. “I see you surrounded by certain evidences of preparation and\r\npower, otherwise your words would seem to me but idle vaporings.\r\nI believe that you are engaged in an armed conspiracy against the\r\ngovernment, but that it will be successful I do not for an instant\r\nbelieve. And,” he added with biting sarcasm, as his anger rose, “it is\r\nindeed typical of the strength and character of your organization when\r\nits admitted head does not dare to discourse sedition and treason in\r\nthe presence of an officer of the King save in closest concealment and\r\nwith masked face!”\r\n\r\nThe High President started slightly; then proudly raised his head:\r\n\r\n“My life is of value, not so much to me, as to the cause I serve,”\r\nhe said. “In all movements of this character certain precautions\r\nare essential. But the hour of precaution is well-nigh past and is\r\ncertainly no longer needed with you whom we safely hold in our keeping.\r\nI came to you thus disguised, because I desired to speak to you simply\r\nas the head of this organization. I deemed it best, until I had secured\r\nyour decision on a matter I shall present to you soon. But since this\r\nmask is made the means of a taunt to our organization, I will remove it\r\nand meet you man to man.”\r\n\r\nAs the High President ceased speaking, he raised his hands to the mask\r\nand rapidly loosened the strings.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the obscuring mists rolled aside from the Professor’s brain,\r\nand before the mask had fairly been removed from the High President’s\r\nfeatures, he sprang to his feet with the cry:\r\n\r\n“General Mainwarren!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nUNFOLDING THE PLAN\r\n\r\n\r\nSilence from all three succeeded for a few moments the Professor’s\r\nstartled exclamation. Then the High President spoke.\r\n\r\n“Now,” he said, turning to Mortimer, “now that I have removed the\r\nsource of your reproach, I trust you will give weight and credence to\r\nmy words.”\r\n\r\n“General,” answered Mortimer, “your great military record, and your\r\neminence as one of the financial powers of the land, are known to me\r\nas they are to the rest of the world. Your words must, therefore, have\r\ndue weight with me, but I must admit, speaking frankly, not credence.\r\nWere almost any other to speak so, I should regard him as either a\r\nloose-brained visionary, or else one seeking to deceive. With you, I\r\nrealize that neither is the case, but I cannot help considering that\r\nyou are seriously mistaken.”\r\n\r\n“It is precisely to show you I am right that I am here,” replied the\r\nHigh President.\r\n\r\n“I’m much flattered,” said Mortimer, “although I fail to see why you\r\nshould be at any pains on that point.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind that for the moment,” answered the High President. “You\r\nwill learn the reason before our interview closes.”\r\n\r\nMortimer bowed.\r\n\r\n“I will begin by explaining to you,” said the High President, “that\r\nthis movement had its origin many years ago--in fact, it began almost\r\nimmediately after the Monarchy was first inaugurated. It began not\r\nwith a united, organized body as we are to-day, but in a number of\r\nscattered, disunited elements possessed of widely divergent aims\r\nand objects. There were those who were opposed to the monarchical\r\ninstitution and who desired the return of the former Republic; there\r\nwere others--and these were by far the larger and more important\r\nbody--who were profoundly dissatisfied with the existing economic\r\nconditions and who eagerly, if vaguely, aspired to a change of some\r\nkind. There was but one common chord uniting these various elements;\r\nall were dissatisfied and all were more or less revolutionary. For a\r\nperiod I studied the problem of how to fuse these various scattered\r\nelements and the problem seemed so difficult that I was for a time\r\nin despair. It was just at that period that by a strange turn of\r\nFate--or by the interposition of Divine Providence, as some may piously\r\nbelieve--that I found myself in a position of commanding financial\r\npower. From that day on the road grew easier for me. From that day on,\r\nI vowed to dedicate my life to raising my countrymen to a higher plane\r\nof liberty and happiness than the world had yet known. Washington had\r\nled them to freedom from the bondage of political tyranny; I would seek\r\nto free them from the far more bitter tyranny of economic bondage. To\r\nthat cause, I have through the years devoted my fortune, my energies\r\nand my work. To that cause I am prepared, if need be, to lay down my\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\n“A noble ideal, indeed!” exclaimed the Professor enthusiastically. “I\r\nadmire and respect you for it.”\r\n\r\n“I appreciate the spirit which has animated you, General,” said\r\nMortimer, “although I dissent from some of the methods you may have\r\nadopted in its execution.”\r\n\r\n“My first care,” said the High President, disregarding the\r\ninterruption, “was to look about me for some means of unifying the\r\nvarious scattered elements of political and economic discontent. This\r\nI soon perceived could not be quickly done. It was a question of\r\ntime, and above all, of education. By education, I mean teaching the\r\nindividual members of the different elements precisely what were the\r\ncauses of their unhappiness and discontent, wherein the true remedies\r\nlay and just what were the conditions they must seek to attain. To this\r\nend I carefully trained a corps of instructors, men and women. These\r\npeople preached no sedition; they advocated no revolutionary movement.\r\nThey simply taught a new form of interesting political economy, showing\r\npeople why they suffered and where lay the remedy. I had not so much\r\ninterest or concern for the great mass of those forming the existing\r\narmy of discontent. They were mostly too set in their own old ideas and\r\naims, although even among these were found some good material. My chief\r\nattention was given to the rising generation. Youth is easily taught\r\nand the impressions of youth are usually vivid and lasting. It was to\r\nthe youth of the land we turned and the results exceeded the highest\r\nexpectations. Before long there were great bodies of men throughout\r\nthe country--men eager and bold with the intensity of youth--who were\r\nfilled not with the vague, shadowy ideas of the political partisan, but\r\nwith a clear knowledge of economics. And it was to the women of the\r\ncountry--to the mothers, the wives and the sisters--that we owed this\r\nmost largely--a plan which I once had the pleasure of suggesting to you\r\nas applicable to your day, Professor Dean.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes,” exclaimed the Professor, “but little did I think you had\r\nactually put it into practical execution.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I had,” answered the High President dryly. “While this work of\r\neducation was going on I was doing everything in my power to render the\r\ngeneral conditions hard as possible for the masses. It was a curious\r\ndual rôle I filled. With my entire being pledged to their ultimate\r\nupraising and welfare, I was temporarily inflicting upon them terrible\r\nhardship and suffering. By many I was regarded as a monster in human\r\nform; even the Court and the Chancellerie protested against what seemed\r\nto be my insatiable exactions--protested not because of the widespread\r\nmisery and suffering inflicted, but because of the dangerous spirit of\r\npublic discontent engendered. Ah, little they suspected that it was\r\nprecisely this dangerous spirit of discontent which I sought to foster\r\nand to feed, for it is through the suffering and the misery of the\r\npeople that the spirit is awakened which leads to great changes. In the\r\nlight of this explanation, Professor, you will now understand the true\r\nmeaning of the proposed corner in coal which so aroused your horror and\r\nindignation.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, I see it all now!” exclaimed the Professor.\r\n\r\n“Thank heaven, there will now be no necessity for that measure and the\r\nawful misery and suffering it would have entailed,” continued the High\r\nPresident. “But I will pass from that painful subject. In addition to\r\nthe education of the people and to tuning the public spirit to the\r\nproper pitch of discontent and revolt by purposely imposed hardship and\r\nmisery, I was busy with one other important subject. Governments and\r\nexisting conditions may eventually be overthrown by education and the\r\nsentiment of the masses, but they cannot be thus directly overthrown.\r\nGovernments and existing conditions are backed, supported and held\r\nin power by force, which is really the first and last word in the\r\naffairs of this world. Education as to cause, effect and remedy and\r\nthe fostering of the necessary sentiment and spirit among the masses\r\nwere well enough by way of general introductory processes, but if the\r\noverthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of a new order of\r\nthings was to be looked for, some means must be found of successfully\r\novercoming the resistance of the armed forces of the King and of the\r\nGovernment. Do you follow me?”\r\n\r\n“Very clearly,” replied Dean, while Mortimer nodded a silent assent.\r\n\r\n“As a soldier trained by practical experience in the art of war,”\r\ncontinued the High President, “I realized how utterly futile it must be\r\nto attempt to arm, drill and organize a sufficient force of men to hope\r\nto successfully cope in open warfare with the trained soldiers of the\r\nKing. To achieve successfully any such result, I must discover a new\r\nmeans of warfare which would give my attacking force some immeasurable\r\nadvantage over our opponents. Not an easy problem to work out, eh,\r\nCaptain Mortimer?”\r\n\r\n“Decidedly not,” replied Mortimer with evident interest.\r\n\r\n“As you are perhaps aware,” resumed the High President, “among the\r\ndifferent great business interests to which I came into possession\r\nwere several which involved various manufacturing processes. Among\r\nthe many employes in my shops was a wild, apparently half-crazy sort\r\nof fellow who was, however, exceedingly clever as an inventor and who\r\nhad already devised several really very ingenious and meritorious\r\ninventions. The man’s first name was Nicholas; we will suppress for\r\nthe present his last name. He was American born, but originally\r\nof Polish origin and his forefathers had all, I understand, been\r\ninventors. This erratic fellow came to me one day. He had come across\r\nsome old-time pamphlets or treatises in the library upon the subject\r\nof aërial navigation. There was one treatise by a certain Professor\r\nDean which seemed to attract his interest strongly. He was full of\r\nthe project and wanted to pursue an extended line of investigation of\r\naërial navigation. I confess I listened with scant interest. The field\r\nseemed to me an unprofitable one commercially, for I could not see what\r\npractical benefit from a transportation standpoint would be gained by\r\naërial navigation. It was doubtless for this very reason, I argued to\r\nmyself, that the subject had thus far not been more fully taken up and\r\nadvanced. Nicholas, however, was evidently not easily to be discouraged\r\nand I regarded his enthusiasm as a species of misfortune. Here was one\r\nof my valuable men off on a tangent and the result could only be that\r\nI would be a loser of his best efforts. However, I did not abruptly\r\nrefuse Nicholas, but out of consideration for his feelings promised to\r\ngive the matter some further thought.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” exclaimed the Professor, “how history repeats itself! It was\r\nalways my experience whenever I approached men of position and power on\r\nthat very subject to meet with discouragement and doubt.”\r\n\r\n“Listen to the sequel,” said the High President. “That night I walked\r\nin my grounds. It was a rarely beautiful night, with a high, clear sky\r\nand a bright, full moon. My mind was occupied with its still unsolved\r\nproblem. I looked up to the heavens above me, as if to seek there\r\ninspiration and light. Suddenly the thought flashed into my mind: What\r\nif an attack could be delivered from the skies above--from the very\r\nheavens themselves! Such an attacking force would be absolutely safe\r\nfrom attack itself, while by dropping high explosives upon any enemy\r\nbelow it could inflict untold devastation. Then Nicholas came into my\r\nmind.”\r\n\r\n“But such form of attack is expressly forbidden by the rules of\r\ninternational warfare!” exclaimed Mortimer.\r\n\r\n“I am aware of that,” answered the High President, “but the rules of\r\ninternational warfare do not apply to revolutions by a people against\r\ntheir government.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose not,” admitted Mortimer grudgingly.\r\n\r\n“The next morning I sent for Nicholas,” said the High President. “He\r\nfound a much changed man. It will be needless for me to recount to you\r\nthe ten thousand and one details in connection with the perfecting\r\nof our plans; our secret work of invention, our secret processes of\r\nmanufacture, our secret places of trial and concealment of finished\r\nmachines. Take, for instance, where we now are. We have here quite an\r\nextensive strip of territory, in a wild, little frequented region. It\r\nis held as private property. In the heart of this territory is this\r\nvalley shut in on all sides by mountain heights--and it affords us\r\nample opportunity of carrying on such work as may be necessary, quite\r\nsafe from observation. On every side our men are out in the guise of\r\nkeepers, carefully guarding every avenue of approach against possible\r\nchance of intrusion. Similar strips of territory and similar retreats\r\nwe hold in various other parts of the country, for our plans are far\r\ntoo carefully laid for us to trust all our eggs to one basket. Let it\r\nbe enough for me to say that everything has thus far progressed most\r\nsatisfactorily and that we have to-day concealed in various places, all\r\nfinished and ready for use, a sufficient number of air-ships, large\r\nand small, to carry out our plans. All this has been done with such\r\nwell-managed quietude and secrecy that not the slightest inkling has\r\nthe government of the true state of affairs. You will now understand,\r\nProfessor Dean, what I meant the day I remarked to you that your\r\ninvestigations in the line of aërial navigation were more important\r\nto the world than you dreamed of. You will also understand why it was\r\nthat I was so desirous of inducing you to leave the Court and come\r\nto me to pursue your further work in that direction. It was not that\r\nI really needed you to develop air-ships, for that had already been\r\naccomplished; but I feared you might produce them for the benefit of\r\nthe government. Such possible production was to us the most serious\r\nmenace to our course, as you will doubtless realize.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; now that I understand all the circumstances,” answered the\r\nProfessor, “I see that very clearly.”\r\n\r\n“As it was,” said the High President, “you certainly sprang your\r\nair-ship upon us with remarkable rapidity. I congratulate you upon your\r\nwork and ourselves upon the fact that we have succeeded in capturing\r\nyou and your ship before you had gone further. You can imagine the\r\nsurprise to our fellows when they hailed and discovered that they were\r\nbeing pursued by a Royal air-ship. They are indeed to be commended for\r\nthe discretion and skill with which they acted.”\r\n\r\n“In what respect?” asked the Professor.\r\n\r\n“They had a machine on board,” answered the High President, “which\r\nwould have blown you to atoms, had they so desired, or they could have\r\nclapped on speed and have escaped you. Had they been fools, they would\r\nhave done one or the other. Being sensible men, they did neither. They\r\nsimply regulated their speed so as to lure you on and thus lead to\r\nyour capture. You see, it was desirable to ascertain as much about you\r\nas possible and learn how grave a peril to us your presence signified.”\r\n\r\n“That accounts for the peculiar movements I noticed during our\r\npursuit,” remarked the Professor.\r\n\r\n“Doubtless,” replied the High President. “Well, I am truly thankful\r\nthey kept their wits and acted as they did. I am glad they did not\r\nallow you to escape and I am even more glad they did not resort to\r\nthe other course. I abhor any unnecessary shedding of blood and I am\r\ngrateful to Providence that our operations that night cost, at most,\r\nonly one life. I may say to you that the life of the King has been\r\nrepeatedly in our hands during our various visitations, but not one\r\nhair of his head has been injured.”\r\n\r\n“What was the object of these visitations?” asked the Professor\r\ncuriously.\r\n\r\n“To satisfy fully the scruples of some of the more conscientious among\r\nthe leaders,” answered the High President. “The present King had shown\r\nhimself to be a more just and mild-mannered ruler than his predecessor\r\nand they thought he should be accorded the saving chances of reform\r\nand abdication. I was opposed to the plan as affording little prospect\r\nof practical results, but yielded so as to satisfy the consciences of\r\nthese men--so that when the time came to strike they could feel that we\r\nhad done so only after no other course was left.”\r\n\r\n“I see--I understand,” said the Professor thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“And now,” said the High President, “all is prepared. The air-ships\r\nare ready and their crews drilled to their work. We have in addition\r\na sufficiently large number of men trained to act as an auxiliary\r\nland force to follow up at the right moment the devastating work of\r\nthe air-ships. The officers pin a gold star, the men a white star--the\r\nStar of Hope--to their left shoulders and in an instant you have a\r\nforce sufficiently recognizable for our purposes. Should any body of\r\nmen be compelled to retreat, they scatter, off with the star from the\r\nshoulder, and in an instant are re-converted into ordinary citizens.\r\nConceive a body of men in a number of mobiles, so built as to be\r\nprotected from ordinary rifle fire, and, hovering in the distance,\r\nawaiting the moment, a scattered mass of men on foot. These latter\r\ncarry only concealed arms, and are apparently noncombatants. Imagine\r\nthe men in the mobiles opening an attack upon a royal regiment, or\r\nother hostile body. The royal troops advance to the attack and the\r\nmen in the mobiles begin to retreat. Then, from the heavens above,\r\nthe air-ships, themselves unassailable, open their attack and hurl\r\ndown high explosives upon the advancing troops. What becomes of the\r\nregiment? In a few moments it is decimated--annihilated! All that\r\nremains is for the men in the motors and the scattered footmen in the\r\ndistance to sweep down upon the scene and take charge of the dead, the\r\ndying and the prisoners. The same way in attacking a fort, or royal\r\npalace. Our air-ships would hover high above and, themselves beyond the\r\nreach of rifles, or of cannon, pursue their attack until the work of\r\ndemolition was complete. As a military man, Captain Mortimer, I ask you\r\nhow can such an attack be successfully resisted?”\r\n\r\n“Are your air-ships rifle proof?” asked Mortimer.\r\n\r\n“Perfectly so from all sides,” answered the High President; “but even\r\nif they were not, it would be an easy matter for them to keep beyond\r\nrange.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so; and they could, of course, still be able to direct the\r\nexplosives hurled with sufficient accuracy?”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely,” replied the High President. “I ask you again how can such\r\na form of attack be resisted?”\r\n\r\nMortimer hesitated a moment before replying.\r\n\r\n“It is obvious,” he said at length, “that if one thousand riflemen\r\nare attacked in the manner you describe by one hundred of an enemy\r\nwhom they cannot by any possibility reach or inflict any punishment\r\nwhatsoever upon, the one thousand men must necessarily succumb to the\r\none hundred. In the case of artillery, the artillerymen would be no\r\nbetter off, for if their enemy were lodged directly above, heavy guns\r\ncould not be raised to a sufficient pitch to bring the enemy within\r\nrange. These propositions are so simple that, I take it, there is no\r\ndisputing them.”\r\n\r\n“And as to a fort?” asked the High President.\r\n\r\n“Substantially the same principles must apply,” answered Mortimer.\r\n\r\n“The government’s warships,” continued the High President, “are\r\nscattered over the various seas. But let us assume that a number of\r\nthem were concentrated in Atlantic waters. Could a ship of the sea do\r\nsuccessful battle with a ship of the air, hovering directly above her\r\nand raining death and destruction down upon her decks? I ask you, what\r\nchance would a ship of the sea have?”\r\n\r\n“A warship,” answered Mortimer with impatience, “could, of course, not\r\nelevate her guns so as to bring within range anything immediately above\r\nher.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” exclaimed the High President triumphantly, “I am pleased to\r\nfind that our minds are in accord on at least some important points and\r\nwe can now, perhaps, come to an understanding.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t fully catch your meaning,” said Mortimer.\r\n\r\n“You don’t suppose,” answered the High President, “that I have held\r\nthis interview with you and disclosed our position so thoroughly simply\r\nfor the purpose of discussing political economy, or questions of\r\nmilitary tactics?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps not,” said Mortimer. “I await the explanation of your purpose.”\r\n\r\n“It is this,” replied the High President. “I sought first to show\r\nyou the merit and justice of our cause, and next, our certitude of\r\nsuccess. You, Captain Mortimer, with your military experience, and you,\r\nProfessor Dean, with your scientific attainments, would be valuable\r\nadditions to our ranks--not so much for the first attack, for all the\r\ndetails of that first attack are already mapped out and settled; but\r\nfor the subsequent work of organization and handling great masses of\r\nmen which must necessarily follow our preliminary successes. We shall\r\nfirst attack the palace and almost simultaneously the city of New York.\r\nWe shall seize upon the persons of the King and the officers of the\r\nGovernment. This preliminary success and demonstration of our power\r\nwill be accompanied by uprisings all over the East, followed a little\r\nlater by similar movements in the West and the South. How could you\r\nlend your aid to a nobler work than the uplifting of your countrymen\r\nin particular and of mankind in general--how engage in a more truly\r\npatriotic task! I invite you--I beg you--to aid in this cause--to join\r\nour ranks.”\r\n\r\nThe High President paused, with eager eyes turned upon his auditors.\r\nFor some moments they sat in silence.\r\n\r\n“I await your answer,” said the High President, turning his gaze\r\ndirectly upon Mortimer.\r\n\r\nFor yet a moment Mortimer sat speechless. At last he spoke.\r\n\r\n“General Mainwarren,” he said, “I don’t doubt the high impulses and\r\nsentiments which direct your action, otherwise your words would\r\nconvey to me the grossest insult. Understanding these impulses and\r\nsentiments as I do, I can accept your words in the spirit in which\r\nthey are intended. But, sir, remember that I wear the uniform of an\r\nAmerican army officer. That uniform, so far as is known, has never\r\ncovered but one traitor and the world-wide obloquy and contempt which\r\nin his own period and through succeeding generations has followed the\r\nname of Benedict Arnold, should be a sufficient example and lesson\r\nfor prospective traitors in all generations to come. The function of\r\nan army officer is not to delve in social economics, or meddle with\r\npolitical questions. He must leave these matters to others. His duty\r\nis to uphold the government of the country and to forever stand ready\r\nto defend and die for, if needs be, the interests and the honor of his\r\ncountry and his flag. Such are the views I hold, General Mainwarren,\r\nand--you have my answer.”\r\n\r\nThe High President, in turn, paused before making reply.\r\n\r\n“I, too,” he said at length, “understand and appreciate the sentiments\r\nwhich dictate your answer. I do not consider that these sentiments are\r\ncorrect from the highest and broadest standpoint of patriotism and\r\nhuman effort, but the answer, such as it is, I must accept, much as I\r\nregret it. And you,” he added, turning to Professor Dean; “what is\r\nyour decision?”\r\n\r\nThe Professor answered without a moment’s hesitation.\r\n\r\n“I am,” he said, “more in touch and sympathy with your project and your\r\naims than Captain Mortimer is, or could be expected to be. Had you\r\ndepicted to me those projects and described to me those aims on the day\r\nwe first met, my answer might have been different from that which it\r\nnow must be. As it is, I have embarked in this joint enterprise with\r\nmy friend, Captain Mortimer, and I should regard myself as playing\r\nthe rôle of traitor which he so severely contemns were I now to fail\r\nhim. I shall stand shoulder to shoulder with Captain Mortimer in this\r\nenterprise, at least, to the very end.”\r\n\r\nThe High President rose and extended his hand.\r\n\r\n“Re-meeting!” he exclaimed. “My mission here has failed. There is\r\nnothing more to be said.”\r\n\r\nHe moved toward the door. Dean called after him.\r\n\r\n“One moment,” he cried; “there is a question I would ask. You spoke\r\njust now of blood having been spilled the night of the chase. What\r\ndid you mean? Was there some mishap which happened to those we were\r\npursuing? I saw no accident.”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered the High President, pausing, “no accident occurred to\r\nany of those you were following. It was at the palace.”\r\n\r\n“At the palace! What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“According to the report made me,” continued the High President, “it\r\ncame about in this way. Our men in the air-ship were preparing to\r\napproach the window of the King’s chamber, but prior to doing so were\r\nscouting around the immediate neighborhood to ascertain if the coast\r\nwas clear.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” exclaimed Dean, “we noticed that!”\r\n\r\n“Next to the King’s chamber was a room with open windows,” went on the\r\nHigh President, “occupied, as they knew, by an officer on guard. Either\r\nan air current must have affected the air-ship which was at the moment\r\nalmost motionless, or the steersman made some slight miscalculation,\r\nfor they suddenly drifted in too close to the room. Our men suddenly\r\nsaw an officer in full uniform spring forward and peer out. It looked\r\nas if he had caught sight of them and was about to give an alarm.\r\nInstantly, one of our men fired. The officer was seen to stagger back\r\nand, without groan or cry, he fell!”\r\n\r\nWith a cry of rage and pain, as of some wounded animal, Mortimer\r\nclenched his hands and began pacing the floor, in deep agitation.\r\n\r\n“But how can this be!” exclaimed Dean. “We were close at hand and we\r\nheard no sound--no shot!”\r\n\r\n“You forget,” replied the High President indulgently, “that most of our\r\nfirearms to-day are noiseless as well as smokeless.”\r\n\r\n“My God--my God!” exclaimed Mortimer, still pacing the floor, “that\r\nofficer was Ralph--my comrade and friend, Captain Swords. Tell me, did\r\nthat shot kill?”\r\n\r\n“That is not known,” replied the High President. “After the shot, our\r\nmen hovered around, peering into the lighted room and prepared to flee\r\nat the slightest sign of an alarm. But no sign of such alarm appeared.\r\nThe officer’s fall upon the heavy carpet appeared to have been unheard,\r\nfor no one came to the room and he lay there motionless. Our men then\r\npassed on to their work at the King’s window, when you appeared a\r\nmoment later upon the scene. You know the rest.”\r\n\r\n“To think that he is lying wounded, perhaps dead, and I here--a\r\nprisoner!” muttered Mortimer fiercely.\r\n\r\n“The fortunes of war,” replied the High President coldly. “What is one\r\nlife in such a struggle? Alas! think of the many, many lives which must\r\nbe sacrificed before this contest closes. As to your imprisonment, I am\r\nwilling to give you the freedom of this entire valley upon your parole\r\nnot to leave it, or to attempt any communication whatsoever with the\r\noutside.”\r\n\r\n“I refuse such parole,” answered Mortimer curtly.\r\n\r\n“And you, Professor Dean?”\r\n\r\n“I follow Captain Mortimer’s lead absolutely.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” answered the High President, “prisoners you must then\r\nremain. But console yourselves with the thought that it will not be for\r\nlong. Ten days from to-day the signal to attack will flash forth--in\r\nten days from to-day the new era will have dawned and your freedom will\r\nbe near at hand. Look forward to your liberation--as tens upon tens\r\nof millions are awaiting their liberation--to the birth of the New\r\nRepublic!”\r\n\r\nHe sprang up the steps and called to the sentinel without. The door was\r\nhurriedly thrown open and an instant later he was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nA STRANGE MESSAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe days passed. Captain Mortimer sat with bowed head and heavy brow,\r\nresisting Valerie’s archest smiles and brightest sallies. The fine\r\nappetite he had displayed on the occasion of the first breakfast had\r\ndeserted him and Valerie’s choicest dishes went back practically\r\nuntouched. Was there anything she could get for him? No; nothing. Was\r\nthere anything special he would like prepared? No; absolutely nothing.\r\nTo all her questions only the same brief, though polite, negatives.\r\nValerie was in despair.\r\n\r\nAlone with Dean, the one topic was escape. They had again carefully\r\nexamined the cabin. There were two portholes on each side--too small\r\nto permit of the egress of even a boy’s body--and the floors, walls\r\nand ceilings were certainly too strongly constructed to be open to\r\nsuccessful attack by men whose only tools were two pocket knives and a\r\nsword. Evidently their only possible chance was by the door.\r\n\r\nTo the door, then, they turned their attention. It was too strong to\r\ngive way to any sudden onslaught and any extended work upon it would\r\ncertainly be heard by the sentinel outside. Besides, the Professor\r\npointed out, even if they did succeed in breaking through and getting\r\npast the sentry, they would doubtless be quickly surrounded and\r\noverpowered by the other men of the camp.\r\n\r\n“It’s probably true,” Mortimer replied. “But I intend to make an\r\nattempt at all hazards. It’s better to die in the valley outside, after\r\na good hot fight, than to perish heart-broken, cooped up here.”\r\n\r\nThen began a search for methods by which they could get past the door\r\nand reach the sentinel outside.\r\n\r\n“Why not lie in wait at the door,” suggested the Professor, “and when\r\nthe food is brought in we can make one spirited dash?”\r\n\r\n“No, that won’t do,” Mortimer said. “It is Valerie who brings the food;\r\nwe can’t treat her so.”\r\n\r\nThey discussed a plan whereby one of them was to feign illness and ask\r\nfor a doctor, or other medical assistance; but it was repugnant to them\r\nboth to seek advantage in any form over one who came on an ostensible\r\nerrand of mercy.\r\n\r\nThey at last hit upon the much simpler expedient of sending a message\r\ndemanding to see the man in command. Henry, with his brutal directness,\r\nwould probably jump at the conclusion that they sought some concession,\r\nor had some terms to propose. With him they would have no scruples.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, when Valerie brought in the dinner on the fourth day\r\nfollowing the visit of the High President, the Professor broached the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n“My dear Miss Robert--” he began.\r\n\r\n“Call me Valerie. Everybody does here. It’s so much simpler,” said the\r\ngirl, as she busied herself with the table.\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes; certainly. My dear Miss Valerie--”\r\n\r\n“Simply Valerie; or you may say ‘dear Valerie,’ if you like,” replied\r\nthe girl, archly.\r\n\r\n“Well--ah--Valerie, then!” stammered the Professor, “would you mind\r\nconveying a message for us, or, to speak more accurately, I should say\r\ncausing a message to be conveyed for us, since we would prefer--and\r\nyou will no doubt know how to manage this--that such message should not\r\ncome from either yourself or your father. Perhaps, I might suggest, you\r\ncould so contrive as to enable us to send it by one of the sentinels\r\noutside this door?”\r\n\r\nThe girl glanced at the Professor curiously.\r\n\r\n“What is the message?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“That we demand to see the person in command here--Colonel Henry, I\r\nbelieve.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! won’t father do?”\r\n\r\n“No, no; not at all! We want to see the one in chief command.”\r\n\r\n“Any complaint as to the cooking or the service?” asked the girl pertly.\r\n\r\n“Really, Miss----”\r\n\r\n“Valerie!”\r\n\r\n“You embarrass me.”\r\n\r\n“I love to do that!”\r\n\r\n“But you will grant what we ask?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll see about it and let you know to-morrow,” she replied, as she\r\nstarted for the door.\r\n\r\nThe following morning at breakfast they again questioned her. She had\r\nnot yet had an opportunity to attend to the matter. At mid-day the same\r\nanswer, but a promise that they should have word at the next meal.\r\n\r\nThe next meal came and with it Valerie. The captives felt their hearts\r\nsink at her first words. Colonel Henry would not see them.\r\n\r\n“What was it he said when our message was given him?” asked Mortimer,\r\n“and by whom was it given?”\r\n\r\nValerie hesitated in a manner very unusual to her before replying. Then\r\nshe broke out impetuously:\r\n\r\n“He did not say anything, because the message wasn’t carried. It\r\nwould have been useless. Papa tells me that the High President gave\r\nimperative orders that Colonel Henry was not to deal in any way with\r\nyou. You are held subject to the orders of the High President himself.”\r\n\r\n“Why didn’t you send the message anyhow?” demanded Mortimer, a bit\r\nimpatiently. “Colonel Henry might decide to see us--you can’t tell. You\r\ndon’t realize how important it is that we see him.”\r\n\r\nShe did not answer these reproaches for some moments. Then suddenly she\r\nturned upon Mortimer.\r\n\r\n“Even if the High President hadn’t given such orders, do you think I\r\nwould bring you and ‘Black Hawk’ Henry face to face after what has\r\nhappened? Colonel Henry is furious. You throttled him before his men\r\nand on top of that he was severely reprimanded by the High President\r\nfor his treatment of prisoners.”\r\n\r\n“How about the insult to me--the cause of it all?” Mortimer asked.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know anything about that,” she answered, “but I’m not so\r\nfoolish as to bring burning oil and gunpowder together! Won’t father do\r\nas well?” she asked in conclusion.\r\n\r\n“No!” Mortimer hastened to answer.\r\n\r\n“Will anybody else?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes; anybody else will do, if he doesn’t come direct from Captain\r\nRobert,” Mortimer assured her.\r\n\r\n“I don’t see how it can be managed,” she said.\r\n\r\nFor a moment they were both in despair. Then Mortimer spoke up.\r\n\r\n“You’ve been very kind to us,” he began, “and we’re indebted to you for\r\nmany favors. Believe me, we both of us appreciate and are grateful to\r\nyou from the bottom of our hearts.”\r\n\r\nA deepening tinge of color crept into the girl’s face, as she looked\r\nup at him with smiling eyes, her white teeth showing between her full,\r\nred lips.\r\n\r\n“We have one more favor to ask of you,” he continued, “a rather\r\npeculiar favor and one which, I trust, you won’t misunderstand. Should\r\nyou decide to grant it, you must do so blindly, without asking a single\r\nquestion as to the why or wherefore.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?” asked the girl eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Just this: that to-morrow one of our meals shall not be brought by you\r\nand that you will let us know in advance which of those meals it is to\r\nbe.”\r\n\r\nThe girl’s head dropped and the color paled from her face. For a moment\r\nshe said nothing. Then she looked up.\r\n\r\n“The dinner is ready,” she said. “Why don’t you eat?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t eat to-night,” answered Mortimer impatiently.\r\n\r\n“It’s horrible to see you pining away in this fashion,” said the girl.\r\n“You’ll die if this keeps up.”\r\n\r\n“Men don’t die so easily,” replied Mortimer, with a short laugh. “But\r\nyou haven’t answered what I asked you.”\r\n\r\nShe hesitated for a moment.\r\n\r\n“Do nothing--make no attempt of any kind to-day,” she cried with sudden\r\nvehemence. “Wait until to-morrow! To-morrow I’ll bring you good news!”\r\n\r\nAnd with these words she turned quickly and fled up the steps.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast time next morning she lingered in the cabin longer than\r\nusual. To Mortimer’s questioning glance, she returned for answer the\r\nsingle word: “Wait!”\r\n\r\nAt mid-day she appeared, bearing her tray as usual, but when she began\r\nto unload it they noticed skilfully concealed among the dishes, two\r\nsmall coils of rope. Her cheeks were flushed and here was an unwonted\r\nagitation in her manner.\r\n\r\n“You wouldn’t eat my food,” she said, “so I’ve brought you something\r\nwhich will be more welcome.” And she touched one of the coils of rope\r\nlightly with her finger.\r\n\r\n“Won’t you speak more plainly?” exclaimed the Professor, with evident\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n“My meaning!” retorted the girl, with impatience. “What do you suppose\r\nI mean except--your escape. Do you think I am both blind and stupid!\r\nDo you think I haven’t seen how you,” and she glanced toward Mortimer,\r\n“have been eating your hearts out here? Do you imagine I didn’t guess\r\nyour meaning when you wanted the ‘Black Hawk’ to come to you, or when\r\nyou wanted me to keep away? Valerie was bright enough to understand the\r\nmeaning of that!”\r\n\r\n“We certainly didn’t mean to reflect upon your intelligence,” replied\r\nthe Professor. “We only hoped you would close your eyes sufficiently to\r\naid us in our plans.”\r\n\r\n“There’s a big move of some kind about to take place here,” said\r\nValerie, “and it wouldn’t astonish me if father were ordered away\r\nat any moment. Now, I’m not going to take any chance of leaving you\r\nhere at the mercy of the ‘Black Hawk.’ He’d kill you at the first\r\nchance--he’s quite capable of it. So I’ll help you in any way to get\r\noff.”\r\n\r\n“We thank you heartily,” answered the Professor. “But what’s your plan?”\r\n\r\n“Listen!” said Valerie. “All the men in camp here have gone off to\r\nMinden Plains, which are back of Pedisgill Hill, to practise some\r\nspecial manœuver--all except the man at the door here, and five men\r\nwho are at work in Big Bear Gap, which is almost at the other end of\r\nthe valley. They are at work on some air-ships there and the ‘Black\r\nHawk’ is keeping an eye over them.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” assented the Professor, “but how are we going to get out of\r\nhere?”\r\n\r\n“When I next return,” said Valerie, “you will seize and bind me\r\nsecurely with one of these cords, which for all anybody will know you\r\nfound by ransacking the cabin.”\r\n\r\n“But how shall we deal with the sentry outside?” questioned the\r\nProfessor.\r\n\r\n“Oh, that will be simple enough,” replied Valerie. “Jack is on guard\r\nand Jack will do anything I say, even though it were to send a bullet\r\nthrough the ‘Black Hawk’ himself. After you have secured me, you will\r\ngive three light taps upon the door. Jack won’t be very much surprised\r\nwhen he opens the door if you suddenly pounce upon him and secure him\r\nin the same way that you do me. You are two to one and his capture\r\nneed not create suspicion. He will struggle, of course, just to keep\r\nup appearances, but don’t hurt the poor boy, since he is really our\r\nfriend.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t like the plan,” broke in Mortimer, speaking for the first\r\ntime, “since it involves violence--or rather the appearance of\r\nviolence--to you. I would much rather you were not mixed up in\r\nthis--much rather that it were managed by that fellow Henry coming\r\nhere, or someone else.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be silly!” exclaimed Valerie. “It’s the kindest thing you can do\r\nfor me, since it will serve to divert suspicion far more than any other\r\nplan.”\r\n\r\n“Still, I don’t like it,” retorted Mortimer obstinately. “I would give\r\nalmost anything I possess to escape from here, but I don’t like your\r\nbeing involved.”\r\n\r\n“I’m bound,” said Valerie, determinedly, “that you shall not remain\r\nbehind at the mercy of the ‘Black Hawk.’ You’ve got to escape. But,”\r\nshe added, her manner softening, “you’ll promise me that after you are\r\nsafely away, you will never bring anything here that will do injury to\r\nme or mine--to the men of this camp?”\r\n\r\n“Should I ever succeed in escaping,” answered Mortimer solemnly, “I’ll\r\npromise never to disclose the situation of this valley, or to lead, or\r\ndirect, any attacking force here. More than this I can’t promise.”\r\n\r\n“It is enough,” said Valerie. “And you?” she asked, turning to Dean.\r\n\r\n“I hold myself bound by the same promise as that given by Captain\r\nMortimer,” he replied.\r\n\r\n“Very well. Now listen carefully,” she continued. “Your air-ship has\r\nbeen moved from where you last saw it. It’s no longer in this inlet.\r\nWhen you pass the door, keep straight out into the main valley. The\r\nmoment you reach the valley you will notice, a short distance away,\r\ntwo inlets to the right. Keep on to the second inlet and there, among\r\nseveral others, you will find your air-ship. If you are seen at all,\r\nit won’t be until after you have risen well over the mountain tops,\r\nand long before any of the men can get back to the air-ships, you\r\nwill be well out of sight and beyond any chance of pursuit. Besides,\r\nI don’t believe they will attempt any chase as they have never taken\r\nany chance of the air-ships being seen by going above the mountain\r\ntops in daylight. How the ‘Black Hawk’ will carry on when he finds you\r\nhave got away! I owe him a grudge or two and it will be great fun to\r\nsee him storm and rage. You have now the whole plan. Are you sure you\r\nunderstand it?”\r\n\r\n“Quite!” replied the Professor.\r\n\r\n“Keep it well in mind, then,” said Valerie. “In half an hour I shall be\r\nback and the time for you will have come.”\r\n\r\nShe ran up the steps and tapped three times lightly on the door. As\r\nit opened they caught a glimpse of the big, good-natured face of the\r\nsentry, as he beamed joyously upon the departing Valerie.\r\n\r\nWhen the door closed after her, Mortimer began striding up and down\r\nthe cabin, strongly agitated by conflicting emotions. On the one hand\r\nwas his strong desire to escape from confinement, so maddening under\r\nexisting circumstances; on the other hand was his dislike for the means\r\nto be adopted.\r\n\r\n“Is it right?” he asked the Professor, “to let this girl mix herself\r\nup in this? We ought not to let her run risks in our behalf. How do\r\nwe know what may be the consequences to her? If she’s suspected, this\r\ndevil, Henry, would stop at nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! you’re hypersensitive,” responded the Professor. “Valerie can be\r\ntrusted to find her way out of any entanglement. The best thing for us\r\nis to accept the chance she offers and get away.”\r\n\r\nMortimer listened, but shook his head moodily and seemed by no means\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nThus the half-hour quickly sped by and, punctually at its expiration,\r\nthe door opened and Valerie reappeared.\r\n\r\n“All ready?” she exclaimed, in rapid tones.\r\n\r\nMortimer raised his head slowly.\r\n\r\n“I shall not go,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Not go! and why?”\r\n\r\n“For the reasons I’ve explained. Don’t think, though, that I am\r\ninsensible to your great kindness--that I thank you the less.”\r\n\r\n“Keep your thanks till some other time,” exclaimed Valerie, with\r\nflushed cheeks; “now is the time to act. You won’t go, eh? We’ll\r\nsee about that. When I make up my mind to something, that something\r\ngenerally comes off, as you shall see!”\r\n\r\nWith these words she sprang up the steps and tapped on the door. It was\r\nimmediately opened.\r\n\r\n“Jack, come here!”\r\n\r\nJack, grinning broadly, promptly descended into the cabin. Valerie\r\ndropped into a seat and pointed to one of the little coils of rope.\r\n\r\n“Tie me, Jack.”\r\n\r\nJack’s eyes opened wide in astonishment and he hesitated.\r\n\r\n“Tie me, Jack. Since when did you begin to disobey my orders? Hurry, I\r\nsay.”\r\n\r\nThus admonished, Jack seized the rope and, with a few skilful turns,\r\nbound her fast.\r\n\r\n“Now,” she cried triumphantly, turning her head toward Mortimer, “now\r\nwill you go, or will you remain here until someone comes and finds us\r\nand we all get into trouble for nothing?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; hurry up and do something,” cried Jack impatiently. “Either I\r\nmust be choked dumb and tied up, or I must get back to my post. What\r\nare you making so much fuss about anyway? Don’t you want to go back\r\nhome to fight? You look like a pretty niftily set up sort of a man,”\r\nhe continued, addressing Mortimer, “but the other doesn’t look as if\r\nhe would count for much. Come, hurry up! You’ve wasted too much time\r\nalready!”\r\n\r\n“You’re right!” exclaimed the Professor, and, rope in hand, he fell\r\nupon Jack and quickly secured him.\r\n\r\nAs for Mortimer, Jack’s reference to going home to fight aroused him.\r\nRapidly there flashed through his mind the vision of a strangely-fought\r\nand bloody struggle in progress, his regiment attacked and he absent\r\nfrom his men and from his duty.\r\n\r\nHe glanced at the Professor now rapidly completing the work of securing\r\nJack. Then he crossed to where Valerie sat.\r\n\r\n“You win,” he said with emotion; “I accept your sacrifice and will go.\r\nBut remember, should you find yourself in peril as the result of this,\r\none word sent to me at the palace and I’m at all times ready to return\r\nand surrender myself.”\r\n\r\n“Include me in that proposition,” interjected Dean.\r\n\r\n“Pull tighter round the ankles!” called out Jack, and the Professor\r\nagain bent to his task. A couple more turns of the rope, a few sharp\r\ntugs and he stood up, his work completed.\r\n\r\n“Go!” whispered Valerie, with pleading lips and eyes upturned to\r\nMortimer. “Go, before it is too late.”\r\n\r\nHe lingered yet a moment.\r\n\r\n“Don’t forget my offer,” he said, “should you find yourself in peril. I\r\nhold myself your debtor for life. You will remember?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! But will you remember something?” returned Valerie hastily. “You\r\nare going into a greater danger than will surround me. In these awful\r\ndays that are to come it is you that most likely will need help. Will\r\nyou remember you have a friend among your--enemies? If I can help you,\r\nremember I--I--Oh! Go, go quickly!”\r\n\r\n“Come, it’s time we were off,” exclaimed the Professor, touching\r\nMortimer lightly upon the arm. The Captain started. Stooping, he kissed\r\nValerie’s hand and tried to murmur his gratitude to the girl, before\r\nhe turned to follow the Professor. Tears were in her eyes; her lips\r\ntrembled slightly.\r\n\r\nThey reached the head of the steps and were outside the door. Mortimer\r\nturned and waved a farewell. Then Dean banged to the door and shot the\r\nbolts.\r\n\r\nRapidly they traversed the gully, reached the main valley and peered\r\nout. No one was in sight. To the right were the two gullies, just as\r\nValerie had described. Skirting closely the base of the mountain to\r\nkeep as much as possible out of sight, they reached the entrance to the\r\nfirst gully and peered in.\r\n\r\nThey saw several air-ships, but nothing else. On they kept and, a few\r\nmoments later, had reached the second gully. Air-ships here, too, and,\r\njoyful sight, their own air-ship away back at the end there. The coast\r\nwas evidently clear and they would reach it in a few minutes and be on\r\nboard. How fresh and sweet the air smelled! How good it was to be free!\r\n\r\nThey pushed on over the intervening space and had proceeded some fifty\r\nyards when around the stern of one of the air-ships before them a man\r\ncame into sight. One glance at the burly figure and black beard was\r\nsufficient. It was the “Black Hawk.”\r\n\r\nThey recognized him and, with an astonished shout, he as quickly\r\nrecognized them.\r\n\r\nInstantly he advanced toward them.\r\n\r\nThey were in a species of small clearing, with air-ships on all four\r\nsides. Mortimer halted. All his moodiness had disappeared. There was a\r\nstrange light in his eyes and a smile upon his lips. He cast a rapid\r\nglance around him. There were no others in sight. Ah, God was good!\r\nThere was the blue sky above their heads and the green grass beneath\r\ntheir feet and he and the “Black Hawk” were face to face.\r\n\r\nAn instant more and he confronted them. A sword hung at his side and\r\nupon his left shoulder there glittered the gold star of an officer of\r\nthe Army of the New Republic.\r\n\r\n“So,” he said, his black beard bristling, his eyes snapping with\r\nhatred, “so you dogs have escaped from your kennel, eh?”\r\n\r\nFrom Mortimer there came no reply. He stood gazing upon his enemy, the\r\nsame peculiar light in his eyes and smile upon his lips.\r\n\r\n“But you’ll quickly march back again,” he continued, with a malignant\r\nsnarl. “At least one of you. As for you, Mr. Fine Feathers, I am glad\r\nto see you are armed, for no blame can then be put upon me. Later, too,\r\nI’ll find out how all this happened. I suspect that heifer, Valerie,\r\nhad a hand in this!”\r\n\r\nThe words sealed his fate. For Valerie’s sake, the thought flashed\r\nthrough Mortimer’s mind, this man must not escape him.\r\n\r\n“Let me first pay my debt!” he exclaimed, and his long, sinuous arm\r\nshot out and struck Henry, with open palm, full in the face.\r\n\r\nThe blow was so sharp and so sudden that Henry reeled. In an instant,\r\nhowever, he had recovered himself and his hand flew to his sword.\r\nMortimer drew with equal celerity.\r\n\r\nThey sprang together and their swords crossed.\r\n\r\nHenry was an expert swordsman and was regarded among the men of the\r\ncamp as an invincible champion with this weapon. He attacked with all\r\nthe confidence of one who holds victory certain. He little dreamed,\r\nhowever, of the skill against which he was now matched--a skill which\r\nin bygone days had held wild Kurd horsemen and fiery Cossacks alike\r\nsuccessfully at bay and had given its owner the reputation of the crack\r\nswordsman of the American ranks. Mortimer fenced smartly, as one on\r\nparade, and the smile still hovered about his lips as he parried his\r\nopponent’s fierce attacks.\r\n\r\nIt was soon over. There was a quick parry, a sharp feint and\r\nMortimer’s arm shot out in a lightning-like lunge. Back reeled Henry\r\nand dropped heavily to earth. Mortimer’s sword had passed beneath his\r\nopponent’s black beard and had penetrated deep into the throat. He lay\r\ngasping--dying; choked with the blood which ebbed from the great wound\r\nand gushed in a gory tide over his neck and breast.\r\n\r\nMortimer shook the blood from his sword.\r\n\r\n“That’s what the swordsmen of the French school call ‘_le coup de\r\ncochon_,’” he said. “It’s a very neat stroke--when properly delivered.”\r\nAnd he turned coolly toward Dean.\r\n\r\nBut the latter stood leaning for support against the side of one of the\r\nair-ships, looking with strained eyes and blanched face at the form\r\nupon the ground.\r\n\r\n“Ah, I forgot,” exclaimed Mortimer, “you’re not accustomed to scenes of\r\nthis kind. It’s astonishing, though, how soon one does get used to them\r\nin war.”\r\n\r\n“Can we lend him no aid,” asked Dean and, overcoming his feelings, he\r\nadvanced and knelt beside the wounded man.\r\n\r\n“He’s beyond human assistance, I assure you,” said Mortimer. “I have\r\nnever known a recovery from that stroke.”\r\n\r\nAnd he was right, for as Dean bent down he saw a great shiver pass over\r\nthe frame of the prostrate man and a moment later all was over; the\r\n“Black Hawk” lay dead.\r\n\r\n“Come; there is no time to lose!” exclaimed Mortimer, and seizing Dean\r\nunder the arm he half led, half carried him to where their air-ship\r\nlay. A hasty scramble on board; an equally hasty inspection of the\r\napparatus to ascertain that all was in order; a quick working of the\r\nlevers by the Professor and they were away.\r\n\r\nSteadily and gracefully they rose until they were above the mountain\r\ntops and the country lay well beneath them. Away in the distance they\r\nperceived a number of men, apparently engaged in the execution of\r\ncertain manœuvers. These were evidently the men referred to by Valerie\r\nas drilling on Minden Plain. From a sudden commotion among the men it\r\nwas evident the air-ship had been seen.\r\n\r\n“We seem to be creating some excitement!” exclaimed Mortimer, referring\r\nto this circumstance. “I wonder if they will attempt a pursuit.”\r\n\r\n“It will be a very useless effort if they do,” replied Dean.\r\n\r\n“Well,” remarked Mortimer, “you know their craft is a good deal faster\r\nthan ours.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know,” answered Dean, “but long before they can even reach\r\ntheir ships, we will have disappeared from view. We are at least fast\r\nenough for that and don’t forget that we leave no trail behind us.”\r\n\r\nUp and up they rose until they were invisible to anything upon the\r\nsurface of the earth. Onward they sped, and no pursuing form appearing\r\nbehind them, they realized that they had indeed escaped. For an hour or\r\nmore they held on thus and at last Dean spoke.\r\n\r\n“I have been keeping entirely away from our proper course,” he said,\r\n“as in that manner I thought we should be less likely to be in the\r\nline of pursuit, if indeed a pursuit be attempted at all. I feel that\r\nwe are quite safe from that now and I had best lay the course for the\r\npalace, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“I should think that would be the right thing to do,” assented Mortimer.\r\n\r\n“But first,” said Dean, “in case of any possible further mishap, I\r\nthink it would be well for us to open up communication with Kearns and\r\nsend him a message. Don’t you think it is time that he had one?”\r\n\r\n“Decidedly,” answered Mortimer. “An excellent idea. But can you do it?\r\nRemember the instrument is in his room in the Chancellerie and the\r\nwindows of that room face South, while we are now due North.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so,” answered Dean, “but the instrument in that room is\r\nconnected with one on the roof of the Palace, so that at this altitude\r\nI can operate from all four points of the compass.”\r\n\r\nDean brought the air-ship to a standstill and allowed it to drift in\r\nthe air currents. Then he applied himself to the aërestograph.\r\n\r\nSilently Mortimer sat awaiting results. Presently Dean laid aside the\r\ninstrument and turned to Mortimer.\r\n\r\n“He does not make any response,” he said. “He is probably away from the\r\ninstrument. We must try again later.”\r\n\r\nDean again started the air-ship and for half an hour they kept on their\r\ncourse. Then Dean again stopped and gave the aërestograph a further\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” he exclaimed immediately, a pleased expression coming into his\r\nface; “now we have him!”\r\n\r\nDean operated the instrument for a minute or more and then was occupied\r\nfor quite some time in the reception of the reply. Kearns, thought\r\nMortimer, was evidently either not a very rapid or very accurate\r\noperator, or else the reply must be of some length. At last it was over\r\nand Dean sent back a brief answer.\r\n\r\n“Very curious!” he muttered, laying aside the instrument.\r\n\r\n“What is very curious?” questioned Mortimer.\r\n\r\n“The reply to our message.”\r\n\r\n“What was it?”\r\n\r\n“First let me give you what I sent,” said Dean. “It was this: ‘We have\r\nbeen prisoners, but have escaped. We are returning with big news and\r\nfullest information.’”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” replied Mortimer; “that would seem to cover the ground very\r\nnicely. And the answer?”\r\n\r\n“This,” replied the Professor, “is the somewhat curious answer I’ve\r\nreceived: ‘Strange happenings since you left. Do not return direct to\r\npalace, but time arrival until after dark and manage unseen descent at\r\nsome quiet spot. Will meet you in park at northern end Queen’s Walk at\r\nmidnight.’”\r\n\r\n“That’s certainly a rather strange message,” said Mortimer.\r\n\r\n“I should call it very strange!” replied Dean thoughtfully. And, with\r\nhis hand upon the lever, he again started on through space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE NEW CHANCELLOR\r\n\r\n\r\nThese were days of great news happenings at the palace. An officer\r\nof the Guard, Captain Stanley Mortimer, had strangely disappeared\r\nand another officer of the Guard, Captain Ralph Swords, had been\r\ndiscovered, in the anteroom of the King’s chamber, senseless and\r\nbleeding from a mysterious bullet wound in the head, inflicted upon\r\nhim while on guard duty. Fortunately the bullet had struck at a sharp\r\nangle and had glanced from the parietal bone, inflicting a severe but\r\nnot necessarily fatal wound. It had been a narrow escape for Captain\r\nSwords, who would be laid up for some time under the palace physician’s\r\ncare.\r\n\r\nThere were various vague rumors afloat concerning these events; rumors\r\nthat hinted at an attempt upon the life of the King. Still, nothing\r\ndefinite was ascertainable.\r\n\r\nEven more talked of was the death of Duke Marquanna, the great Lord\r\nChancellor of the realm, the famous Warwick of the American monarchy.\r\nHe had been found dead in his bed on the morning following the last\r\nCourt ball, having passed away peacefully during the night.\r\n\r\nThe air was full of gossip about the late Duke and particularly as\r\nto his probable successor. It was well known that it had been the\r\nambition of the late Duke that his son should succeed him. But the\r\nMarquis Marquanna, while shining as a social leader, a sportsman and\r\na setter of the fashions, seemed to have either little ambition, or\r\nlittle inclination, for the more weighty and burdensome affairs of\r\nState. It was true he had given a name to a new cocktail, or rather, an\r\nold cocktail somewhat altered as to its component parts had been named\r\nafter him, as also a new style of cravat and a new brand of cigars, and\r\nthe Marquis seemed to think that with this he had accomplished all that\r\nought reasonably to be expected of him in this life.\r\n\r\nIt thus created no very general astonishment when the King named as\r\nhis Chancellor, to succeed the late Duke, Lord Cyril Ashley, whose\r\nfulfillment of the duties of Vice-Chancellor had familiarized him with\r\nthe work in hand. Lord Ashley had in consequence of this appointment\r\nsevered his connection with the Army and had at once assumed the office\r\nof Chancellor.\r\n\r\nAlmost his first move as Chancellor caused irritation to those forming\r\npart of the Royal Household. Owing to Lord Ashley’s own resignation\r\nfrom the Guards and to the absence of Captain Stanley Mortimer and the\r\npresent disability of Captain Ralph Swords, there existed one permanent\r\nand two temporary vacancies in the Guards corps.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary staff appointment lay usually with the War Office, but in\r\nthe case of appointments to the Guards the selection was made by His\r\nMajesty himself from a list of officers specially distinguished and\r\nsubmitted by the Minister of War.\r\n\r\nIt had leaked out--in that mysterious way that things will leak out at\r\nCourt--that Lord Ashley, in his position of confidential adviser to\r\nthe King, had interfered in this instance with the list submitted, as\r\nfar as two of the appointments, at least, were concerned. The officer\r\nselected to fill the permanent vacancy was Captain Farquharson, an\r\nofficer of excellent family with a gallant service record. His name had\r\nbeen on the list submitted by the Minister of War and his appointment\r\ngave general satisfaction at Court. The other two appointments, to\r\nfill the temporary vacancies, were those of Captain Haslam and Captain\r\nBagley. These two names were not in the list furnished by the Minister\r\nof War and neither officer had won any special distinction in the\r\nservice. Both had served in the field, and that which was chiefly\r\nknown concerning Captain Bagley was that he had at one time been tried\r\nby court martial for the summary execution of certain Cossacks under\r\ncircumstances--if the charges advanced were true--of exceptional\r\nbrutality. True, the charges had not been fully proven and he had been\r\nacquitted, but a lingering suspicion hovered over his name. Neither of\r\nthese men was of the character usually appointed to the Guards.\r\n\r\nThe Court grumbled, but Lord Ashley was not the manner of man to be\r\nperturbed over mere grumblings and the Court was forced to console\r\nitself with the reflection that the two unpopular appointments were,\r\nafter all, only likely to prove temporary ones.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this there were other and more momentous matters\r\nattracting the attention of the Court gossips. There were\r\nrumors--vague, undefined but persistent--of trouble brewing in the\r\ncountry at large. The Reactionists, it was asserted, were showing\r\nunusual activity of late; several quite prominent men, it was said,\r\nwere under suspicion of secretly fomenting insurrectionary movements\r\nand certain startling discoveries in this connection had lately been\r\nmade, thanks to the energy of Lord Ashley, assisted by the mysterious\r\nMr. Kearns, who seemed to be in such close touch with the King.\r\nIn fact, Mr. Kearns had come to be regarded as one possessed of\r\nsecret power and high influence and was the recipient of numerous\r\ndistinguished attentions forthwith. Various persons attached to\r\nthe Court sought him out, entered into conversation and angled\r\nenergetically for information. Lady Brooke, in particular, diligently\r\npumped him for a long half-hour as to what he knew regarding the\r\nmysterious disappearance of Captain Stanley Mortimer. Mr. Kearns\r\nlistened placidly; uttered solemn generalities and told nothing. With\r\nLady Brooke he did go so far as to inform her that he would furnish her\r\nwith the information she desired “in due course,” with which answer,\r\nin spite of further energetic probings, my Lady Brooke had to rest\r\ncontent. The result was that Mr. Kearns was put down as a man who knew\r\nmore than he would tell and as a very wise person generally. He was\r\nby no means the first with whom a well-assumed air of reticence and\r\noracular solemnity have passed for deep wisdom.\r\n\r\nIt was further whispered that Lord Ashley and Mr. Kearns were working\r\nhand in hand in the matter of the suspected conspiracies and that\r\nstartling disclosures were before long to be anticipated.\r\n\r\nLike most rumors, the ones in question possessed a certain percentage\r\nof truth and fact mixed with a far larger percentage of fiction.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed true that Kearns had been taken in high favor by the\r\nKing. Whether it was Mr. Kearns’s particular aptitude for impressing\r\npeople, or whether it was due to some peculiar intuition, the fact\r\nremained that His Majesty entertained the belief that he was the one\r\nman above all others suited to occupy the position of his confidential\r\nSecret Service Chief and that it was he who was destined to unravel the\r\nvarious mysteries with which His Majesty had in the past been annoyed.\r\nThere was this much to be said in favor of Kearns--he was free from\r\nany political affiliations and could not by any possibility be mixed\r\nup with any Court, or outside, influences: an extremely desirable man,\r\ntherefore, from this viewpoint alone.\r\n\r\nAs for Mr. Kearns, he maintained much the same demeanor and policy\r\nwith the King that he had adopted when under the interrogatory fire of\r\nindividual members of the Court. As a result of the last visitation,\r\nthe King had found in his chamber another threatening document, which\r\nset forth that this was the final warning; that only a few days’ grace\r\nwas accorded for his compliance with previous demands and that, failing\r\nthis, the impending doom would descend.\r\n\r\nThe King wanted to know many particulars: the disappearance of Captain\r\nMortimer; the wounding of Captain Swords.\r\n\r\nKearns adhered staunchly and steadfastly to his invariable rule never\r\nto make partial disclosures; never to say anything until his case was\r\ncomplete. There was really much to commend itself in this plan. Every\r\nadditional person to whom information was imparted, he considered,\r\ncreated an additional chance of a leak; again, if by any chance one\r\nwas on the wrong track one could retrace one’s steps without letting\r\nanyone know of the error into which one had fallen and thus lessening\r\nconfidence generally and the illusion as to one’s infallibility. But\r\nthe feature which, perhaps, weighed most of all with Mr. Kearns was\r\nthat a case told bit by bit, lost much of the dramatic sensationalism\r\naccompanying the disclosure of the completed investigation. And Mr.\r\nKearns loved sensationalism and dramatic effect. He was an artist who\r\nsought to flash up the lights suddenly upon his _mise en scène_,\r\nand the groupings after discovery, the false scents followed up, the\r\nwrong suspicions, the mistakes and all the precise methods employed\r\nfinally to reach the truth were so much paraphernalia of the completed\r\nproduction which he desired to keep out of sight.\r\n\r\nFollowing his system he had told the King practically nothing, except\r\nthat “satisfactory progress” was being made and that he would be\r\nprepared to submit a completed case “in due course.” The wounding\r\nof Captain Swords and the disappearance of Captain Mortimer were\r\nincidents concerning which he would prefer not to furnish information\r\nat the present stage. All would be duly disclosed when the case was\r\ncompleted. At this the King had frowned, but Mr. Kearns was firm. The\r\nunderstanding when he had taken up the matter was that he should be\r\npermitted to employ his own methods--methods which had been tested and\r\nhad proved successful in the past--and unless he were permitted to\r\nfollow out these methods, he would not be answerable for results and\r\nwould prefer to be relieved from further prosecution of the inquiry.\r\nAs the King was intensely eager for the successful prosecution of the\r\ninquiry, and as Kearns was a man who spoke with confidence in his\r\nultimate success, the King arrived at the conclusion that it was best\r\nto permit him to pursue matters in his own peculiar way. Should his\r\npredictions ultimately turn out a mere fiasco, the royal favor could be\r\nwithdrawn and Kearns driven forth in disgrace.\r\n\r\nLord Ashley, too, had approached Kearns, intimating diplomatically that\r\nthey work together. Faced with this situation, Kearns rapidly cast\r\nmatters over in his mind and decided to adhere to his customary policy.\r\nHe could see nothing to be gained by filtering out such information\r\nas he possessed to Lord Ashley; on the other side, there might be\r\ndistinct disadvantages in disclosing his hand and showing how little he\r\nso far really held there. Lord Ashley had, therefore, failed to secure\r\nanything from Kearns, which circumstance he seemed to accept with\r\nrather bad grace.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Kearns was sorely puzzled. Summing up all he\r\nreally knew, it amounted to but little. He knew how the visitations by\r\nthe enemies of the King were contrived, but as to who these enemies\r\nwere, where they lurked and what their resources and objects were, he\r\nwas still in the dark. He shrewdly surmised the facts of the attempt\r\nupon the life of Captain Swords; still that was a mere collateral\r\nincident and did not avail him to any appreciable extent. Lastly, he\r\nknew the details accompanying the disappearance of Captain Mortimer,\r\nbut with the possession of these details his knowledge in that\r\ndirection reached its limit.\r\n\r\nWhat had become of Captain Mortimer and Professor Dean? Kearns felt he\r\nhad made a very close guess as to the actual truth. That they had met\r\nwith some disaster to their air-ship and been hurled to destruction\r\nwas, of course, possible; but Kearns did not accept this theory. He had\r\nthe utmost confidence in the Professor. He was a cautious man; knew\r\nwell what he was about; had made careful tests of his air-ship, and\r\nhad said it could fly. This was enough to convince Kearns. Besides, if\r\nan accident had happened, news of it from some source would have been\r\nhad. In this way Kearns deduced the truth, though for him it was only a\r\ntheory that in following up the pursuit they had either been led into\r\nsome trap or else overpowered by those whom they followed and made\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\nKearns had not been blind to this latter possibility from the\r\nbeginning. The danger of it had occupied his attention long before the\r\nProfessor and Mortimer had started, but it was a danger he saw no way\r\nof averting under the circumstances. There was nothing to be done but\r\nto run the risk.\r\n\r\nAnd now this very possibility which he had foreseen, but could not\r\nprovide against, appeared to have come to pass! What was to be done?\r\n\r\nHe had an ingenious but elaborate scheme of his own by which the\r\nmissing ones might possibly be traced, but he laid it aside as one\r\ninvolving the expenditure of too much time and affording too many\r\nchances of failure. He preferred to wait quietly in the expectant hope\r\nthat matters would presently take a turn his way. Captain Mortimer, he\r\nargued, was a man of energy, determination and courage; the Professor\r\nwas full of scientific resources. He had faith in these qualities of\r\nhis two associates; he had an abiding faith, too, in his own good luck,\r\nwhich had rarely deserted him at a critical point. Whether it was a\r\nspecies of intuition or whether it was simply confidence bred from past\r\nsuccesses he knew not, but something within him seemed to say that the\r\nright policy was to watch quietly and wait and things would yet come\r\nhis way.\r\n\r\nBut how long that might take and how long the King’s patience would\r\nhold out, were knotty questions which sorely perplexed Mr. Kearns.\r\n\r\nHe was aware from certain news which reached him and certain\r\nobservations that, since his refusal to indulge in disclosures, Lord\r\nAshley was doing active work in various directions, employing for\r\nthis purpose the men of the regular Secret Service. Kearns had had\r\ncertain men of the Secret Service assigned to him by the King, in\r\ncase he should have use for their services. These men regarded him\r\nas their possible future chief and were anxious enough to serve him.\r\nThey brought him reports, therefore, of the efforts of Lord Ashley\r\nwhich were then being made through their fellows. They also brought him\r\nnews concerning the restlessness and discontent prevalent throughout\r\nthe country, which appeared to have been largely fomented by the\r\ngrasping operations of various great Trusts, inflicting such hardships\r\non the people as to make them desperate. A peculiar and suspicious\r\ncircumstance, too, was the organizing, arming and drilling of many new\r\nmilitary bodies, formed ostensibly as auxiliary volunteer regiments.\r\nThere seemed to be a peculiar free-masonry about them which rendered\r\nit practically impossible for any stranger to enroll among them and so\r\ndiscover something more definite as to their true internal affairs. All\r\nthis, Kearns was aware, was known to Lord Ashley, who in addition had\r\nfurther information which had not yet reached him.\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, no great surprise to him when on the morning of\r\nthe sixth day after the departure of the Dean air-ship, the King\r\nsent for him and opened the interview by announcing that Lord Ashley\r\nhad succeeded in making important discoveries. Kearns, with an air\r\nof well-assumed indifference, inquired if he might venture to ask\r\nwhat these discoveries might be. His Majesty was pleased to smile\r\nindulgently and reply that Lord Ashley seemed to be rivaling Kearns\r\nin the matter of reticence. Certain facts, however, His Majesty was\r\nwilling to impart to Kearns. They might, he suggested, assist his\r\ninvestigations and, if their views were agreed, he might see his way to\r\nco-operating with Lord Ashley.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty then gave the information that Lord Ashley had made\r\ndiscoveries convincing him that certain conspiracies were hatching\r\nand certain seditious movements on foot. Lord Ashley had information\r\nshowing Captain Stanley Mortimer’s participation in these treasonable\r\ntransactions. He had, in fact, aided and abetted the enemies of the\r\nKing upon the occasion of their last visitation to the palace and,\r\nbelieving he had been seen and recognized by Captain Swords, had shot\r\nthe latter and escaped, never to return, or else, learning that no\r\nsuspicion had attached itself to him on account of the Swords incident,\r\nhe would return and tender some specious pretext for his absence. Of\r\ncourse, his presence in the palace would be a danger and a menace.\r\n\r\nKearns listened to the end. Only the august presence in which he stood\r\nprevented him from laughing outright.\r\n\r\n“And are these the disclosures Lord Ashley made to you, Sire?” asked\r\nKearns, with a cynical smile.\r\n\r\n“Such is, in brief, part of the report,” said the King. “What have you\r\nto say to it?”\r\n\r\n“Simply this, Sire,” answered Kearns; “it shows how grievously a man\r\nwill blunder when he dabbles in an art he doesn’t understand.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you differ with Lord Ashley?”\r\n\r\n“Not only differ with him, Sire,” replied Kearns boldly, “but I\r\npronounce him wholly and utterly wrong. Why, Captain Swords himself can\r\nassure you of this!”\r\n\r\n“Captain Swords,” said the King, “did not see his assailant and is\r\nhimself, I am informed, entirely deceived as to Captain Mortimer.”\r\n\r\n“I beg to assure you, Sire,” declared Kearns earnestly, “that Captain\r\nMortimer has been guilty of no conspiracy, or other seditious act.\r\nHe is one of the bravest and most loyal officers in Your Majesty’s\r\nservice. You have been utterly misled in this matter.”\r\n\r\n“You speak with such conviction,” said the King, “that your words\r\ncarry weight with us. Still, we would learn the reasons with which you\r\nsupport your assertions.”\r\n\r\n“When I assumed this task, Sire,” replied Kearns, “it was with the\r\nexpress stipulation that I should be permitted to adopt my own methods.\r\nI must beg you, Sire, to permit me to withhold my report until I can\r\npresent a completed case.”\r\n\r\n“Be it as you ask, then,” said the King, with a slight frown. “We\r\nwould not have it in your power to ascribe failure to any interference\r\nyou had met with. In the meantime, you must not be astonished if we\r\ngive ear and weight to the disclosures of Lord Ashley. He, at least,\r\nbrings some news and that news we regard as of sufficient importance to\r\nwarrant the apprehension of Captain Mortimer and we have so ordered.”\r\n\r\nKearns visibly expressed his astonishment.\r\n\r\n“Captain Mortimer,” continued the King, “has, we are aware, performed\r\ngallant military service and his arrest has been so ordered as to\r\npreserve due secrecy and not injure his career should it develop, as\r\nyou pretend, that a mistake has been made.”\r\n\r\n“It most assuredly has, Sire,” replied Kearns.\r\n\r\n“When you are prepared to furnish proof of that fact,” rejoined the\r\nKing, “the order can be rescinded. Until then it will stand. It\r\nbehooves you to hasten. We leave for our City Palace to-day but shall\r\nreturn here to-morrow. It would meet our pleasure and win our approval\r\nshould you be prepared to furnish such proof, or other report, by\r\nto-morrow.” With these words the King signified that the interview was\r\nat an end.\r\n\r\nSomewhat downcast Kearns retired to the room assigned him off the\r\nChancellerie. The end of his rope seemed near at hand. Here was the\r\nKing insisting on a report on the next day and here he was practically\r\nwithout news. He looked wistfully, as he had so often looked during the\r\npast few days, at the little aërestograph. Ah, if it would only bring\r\nits message!\r\n\r\nKearns regretted that Captain Mortimer should have been brought under\r\nsuspicion so undeservedly. Lord Ashley was apparently playing a\r\npeculiar game. He wondered what that game might be. He decided it would\r\nbe well to see Lord Ashley and possibly gain some further light on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nWith another wistful glance at the aërestograph, he walked to the door\r\nconnecting his room with the main room of the Chancellerie. He opened\r\nthe door, pushed aside the heavy portiere hanging before it and passed\r\nin. Lord Ashley proved to be engaged at the moment, but requested that\r\nhe return in half an hour.\r\n\r\nKearns accordingly made his way back to his room. As he entered he\r\nhalted abruptly and his heart gave a great bound. The aërestograph was\r\nvigorously signaling for someone to receive a message.\r\n\r\nWith an effort he controlled his excitement, ran to the instrument\r\nand signaled back. Communication established, Dean’s message began to\r\ncome. His recent interview with the King in mind, Kearns sent back the\r\nwarning message.\r\n\r\nIn his excitement Kearns could hardly refrain from executing a few\r\nfancy steps. This very night amid the sheltering trees at the further\r\nend of the Queen’s Walk, he would know all! Truly, the news came in the\r\nnick of time! At last fortune was smiling sweetly!\r\n\r\nIt was with buoyant spirits that Kearns went to his interview with Lord\r\nAshley half an hour later. The Chancellor met him coldly and proved\r\nextremely reticent. Finally Kearns touched upon the subject of Captain\r\nMortimer and assured him that he was making a serious mistake in his\r\naccusation. Lord Ashley listened to his assurances with cold cynicism.\r\nHe replied shortly that he well knew what he was doing and would be\r\npersonally answerable for any mistakes made. At this reply, Mr. Kearns\r\nfelt himself growing warm behind the ears and somewhat brusquely\r\nrejoined that in this particular case the noble lord did not know what\r\nhe was doing. To this Milord Ashley retorted with a sneer that he\r\nbelieved one would not need to know much concerning Captain Mortimer\r\nto be in possession of more information on the subject than Mr. Kearns\r\nheld.\r\n\r\n“Ah, you really think so!” exclaimed Kearns, becoming suddenly cool.\r\n“It is as serious a mistake as the other.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!” retorted Lord Ashley with the same sneer.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” rejoined Kearns, “and it may interest you to learn that I have\r\nwithin the past few minutes been in direct communication with Captain\r\nMortimer. It is only a question of hours when he will present himself\r\nhere to confront you and answer to the King!”\r\n\r\nAnd while the expression of astonishment which this very positive\r\nannouncement created still lingered upon Lord Ashley’s features,\r\nMr. Kearns bowed politely and with a satisfied and triumphant smile\r\nwithdrew.\r\n\r\nPunctual to the stroke, he repaired at midnight to the appointed spot\r\nat the end of the Queen’s Walk and found Mortimer and Dean already\r\nawaiting him.\r\n\r\n“When did you arrive?” asked Kearns, after the first greetings.\r\n\r\n“Only a few minutes ago,” answered the Professor. “We came back very\r\nslowly, purposely delaying our arrival until after nightfall, in\r\naccordance with your instructions.”\r\n\r\n“And what have you done with the air-ship?”\r\n\r\n“We had to descend within the park itself,” replied Dean, “otherwise we\r\ncould not have got past the sentries. The air-ship is concealed among\r\nthe trees near the river. It will be safe enough until morning.”\r\n\r\nWithout further delay, Mortimer and Dean told Kearns all the events in\r\nconnection with their capture and escape, and what they had learned\r\nduring their detention. All they suppressed was any information as to\r\nthe precise location of the valley. Kearns listened intently, asking\r\nvarious questions. He was now, indeed, in a position to present a\r\ncompleted case! Here was information, in truth, for His Majesty,\r\nthe King! How the puny disclosures of Milord Ashley would pale into\r\ninsignificance beside such disclosures as these!\r\n\r\nKearns, in turn, narrated the events which had occurred at the palace\r\nsince their departure--the wounding of Captain Swords, who was rapidly\r\nrecovering; the death of the Duke of Marquanna; the elevation of Lord\r\nAshley to the office of Chancellor; the investigations started and\r\naccusations launched by the latter, and the order of arrest issued\r\nagainst Mortimer.\r\n\r\nThe latter was naturally both astonished and indignant, but not so\r\nmuch so as Dean, in the light of his past experiences with him, would\r\nhave expected. After listening to the end of Kearns’s recital, he said\r\nthat he strongly suspected Lord Ashley of personal motives in giving\r\ncredence to these suspicions. Lord Ashley, in his present position as\r\nChancellor, was possessed of a great deal of power and they must act\r\ncleverly and cautiously. The best to be done was to secure, as quickly\r\nas possible, an audience with the King and explain to him all. In\r\nany event, Mortimer insisted it was his duty to communicate promptly\r\nto the King his knowledge of the revolutionary movement. Whether the\r\nthreatened attack took place as predicted or not, the King must be\r\nspeedily apprized.\r\n\r\nBut the King’s absence until the morrow made immediate communication\r\nimpossible. Kearns suggested that Mortimer and Dean retire to a\r\nneighboring village until the following day. Immediately the King\r\nreturned, he would arrange an interview for Mortimer. In this plan\r\nMortimer refused to acquiesce. He said that as an order of arrest had\r\nbeen issued against him, it was his duty, as a military officer, to\r\nsurrender at once. He did not care to play the fugitive even for one\r\nnight. Besides, he added, what difference did it make? It was only a\r\nquestion of a few hours and, although a prisoner, he would be made\r\nas comfortable as in his own quarters and would be treated with the\r\nconsideration due to an officer of the Guard.\r\n\r\nAs Mortimer could not be dissuaded from his views on this point, it\r\nwas finally decided that he should come forward at once and subject\r\nhimself to arrest and that Kearns should return as quietly as possible\r\nwith Dean to the palace. Immediately upon the arrival of the King upon\r\nthe following day, Kearns was to see His Majesty and impart to him such\r\ninformation as would lead to Mortimer being accorded a prompt interview.\r\n\r\nThis plan having been decided upon, they walked together along the\r\nfurther end of the park toward one of the entrances. Presently Mortimer\r\nstopped and, taking leave of them, went forward alone.\r\n\r\n“Who goes there!” came the challenge of the sentinel.\r\n\r\n“Officer of the Guard,” replied Mortimer.\r\n\r\n“Advance, Officer of the Guard, and give the countersign.”\r\n\r\nMortimer walked up to the sentry-box and the soldier, recognizing his\r\nofficer, smartly brought his carbine to the salute.\r\n\r\n“Send for the officer of the day,” ordered Mortimer.\r\n\r\nThe soldier reached into the sentry-box and touched a signal.\r\n\r\nA few moments later Captain Bingham appeared. There was a cordial\r\ngreeting on both sides and then Captain Bingham leaned forward and\r\nwhispered something close to Mortimer’s ear.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know!” interrupted Mortimer, and arm in arm they strolled away\r\nin the direction of the military quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nFROM BEHIND THE CURTAIN\r\n\r\n\r\n“So he has returned?” said Lady Brooke.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Lord Ashley, “and is a prisoner. I hold him in my grasp.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t like that last,” said Lady Brooke. “It sounds vindictive. By\r\nthe way, I may say frankly that it’s well he returned just when he did.\r\nI was beginning to grow suspicious.”\r\n\r\n“Suspicious, Milady? Of what, may I ask?”\r\n\r\n“Of you,” retorted Lady Brooke, with unabashed frankness. “I don’t\r\nforget that though we work together, yet your interests in this matter\r\nare somewhat different from mine. It would doubtless suit you well\r\nenough if he were put out of the way for good and all, but that’s no\r\npart of my plan. My compact was only for a temporary injury--one that\r\nit would be possible to repair readily.”\r\n\r\n“It seems to me, Milady, that you always were somewhat given to\r\nsuspicion,” retorted Lord Ashley, with a slight sneer.\r\n\r\nLady Brooke reddened and an angry light shone in her eyes.\r\n\r\n“It may be well,” she said slowly, “for you to remember, Milord, that\r\nI expect any compact you may make with me to be kept fully and fairly.\r\nChancellors may be made,” she continued with emphasis, “and they may\r\nalso be unmade, if history records aright. I have still some influence\r\nnear the Throne, as those who care to question it may find.”\r\n\r\n“Royalty, it is said, is rarely grateful for past favors, but I will\r\nadmit there are exceptions, Milady,” said Lord Ashley in honeyed\r\naccents.\r\n\r\n“Would you care to measure how much that influence is a matter of the\r\npast?” asked Lady Brooke, with concentrated anger. “Would it astonish\r\nyou, perhaps, to discover that influence to be greater to-day than\r\never?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, a dual influence!” exclaimed Lord Ashley. “You have in mind, no\r\ndoubt, your charming protégée, the beautiful Miss Cameron, lately\r\npresented by you at Court and incidentally to the attention of His\r\nMajesty.”\r\n\r\n“Enough!” exclaimed Lady Brooke, her anger flashing suddenly into\r\nflame; “since you dare----”\r\n\r\n“There, there!” interrupted Lord Ashley soothingly. “Don’t let us\r\nquarrel. I have no intention of questioning your power, past or\r\npresent, Milady, nor do I seek to have that power turned against me. I\r\nhave enemies enough already. Won’t you now listen to my plan?”\r\n\r\n“What is it?” asked Lady Brooke, still angry, but grown suddenly wary.\r\n\r\n“This,” said Lord Ashley: “At fifteen and a half o’clock to-day,\r\nCaptain Haslam, who is the officer of the day, will receive an order\r\nbearing the Royal seal, to release Captain Mortimer. This order he will\r\nimmediately execute and then proceed to destroy the order and forget\r\nthat he ever received such document. As you know, Captain Haslam is\r\none of my appointees and he can be trusted implicitly to carry out my\r\ncommands. The same messenger who carries the order of release will\r\nleave for Captain Mortimer a letter, requesting him to proceed at once\r\nto the little summer-house on Antler Hill, a short distance away in the\r\nPark, where he will meet the friend who has procured his release and\r\nlearn matters of importance to him. Do you follow me thus far, Milady?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” hastily assented Lady Brooke.\r\n\r\n“Gratified over this sudden release,” continued Lord Ashley, “and\r\ncurious to ascertain who this friend may be and what is to be imparted\r\nto him, it is only natural to infer that Captain Mortimer will lose\r\nno time in making his way to the rendezvous. Needless to say that the\r\nfriend he will find there will be--you.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” assented Lady Brooke. “Continue.”\r\n\r\n“You will inform him,” proceeded Lord Ashley, “that he is the victim\r\nof a court intrigue; that the King’s mind is poisoned against him for\r\nthe time being and that he is in serious danger; that you, knowing\r\nthis, have secured his release by a forged order; that his only safety\r\nlies in temporary flight and concealment and that, if he will follow\r\nyour instructions, you can surely promise him that within two short\r\nmonths all danger will have disappeared, when he will be restored to\r\nroyal favor and appointed to the Colonelcy of any one of the crack\r\ncavalry regiments he may select--outside of the Guards. By this plan,”\r\ncontinued Lord Ashley, “we both attain our ends--the temporary removal\r\nof the gallant Captain from the atmosphere of the Court; and you, in\r\naddition, secure control of his person and movements to do with him\r\npractically as you will.”\r\n\r\n“But suppose he should refuse the bait?” inquired Lady Brooke. “Suppose\r\nhe elects to stay and face the danger?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, that is a matter, Milady, which it seems to me lies with you!”\r\nprotested Lord Ashley. “I really think you estimate your powers of\r\npersuasion and of--of--attraction too lightly.”\r\n\r\n“But suppose he should refuse?” persisted Lady Brooke. “What then?”\r\n\r\n“Then,” replied Lord Ashley, “I don’t see that we shall be any worse\r\noff than before. If he refuse, he will simply return to the military\r\nquarters and surrender himself once more. It will be time enough then\r\nto put our heads together and see what further we can do, but by trying\r\nthis present plan it affords us at least a chance of success. Remember\r\nthat he must have heard something of your influence at Court and you\r\nare certainly holding out a very brilliant inducement to him.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I am willing to try,” said Lady Brooke, with determination. “We\r\nshall see what will come of it.”\r\n\r\n“And you will succeed!” declared Lord Ashley, with conviction. “I am\r\npositive we shall both succeed!”\r\n\r\nLady Brooke had been gone but a few minutes when Captain Haslam was\r\nannounced.\r\n\r\n“Captain Haslam,” said Lord Ashley, “at fifteen and a half o’clock\r\nto-day, or perhaps even a little earlier, an order will be presented\r\nto you for the release of Captain Stanley Mortimer, accompanied with\r\na letter for him. You will have that letter delivered to him at\r\nonce and you will immediately release the prisoner. The instant he\r\nleaves the quarters, you will destroy the order and, under any and\r\nall circumstances, you will forever forget that such an order has\r\never reached your hands. Whenever the question comes up as to the\r\ndisposition of this prisoner, he has escaped. You clearly understand?”\r\n\r\n“I clearly understand, Milord,” answered Captain Haslam, as he saluted\r\nand retired.\r\n\r\nLord Ashley’s next visitor was Captain Bagley.\r\n\r\n“Captain,” said Lord Ashley abruptly, “you are called upon for a\r\ncertain service of state, such as occasionally arises in the affairs of\r\ngovernment. Upon your faithful and discreet performance of that service\r\ndepends the matter of future favors and promotion.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Bagley bowed low, maintaining a respectful silence.\r\n\r\n“Your orders are these,” continued Lord Ashley: “At fifteen o’clock\r\nto-day you will proceed to a point in the park where you can observe\r\nthe summer-house upon Antler Hill. Conceal yourself from observation\r\namong the trees, or bushes. At about fifteen and three-quarters o’clock\r\nyou will observe an escaped prisoner walking along the Stag Walk toward\r\nAntler Hill. That escaped prisoner will be Captain Stanley Mortimer.\r\nPermit him to proceed to Antler Hill, where he will be met by a certain\r\npersonage, whom it is not your concern to recognize. Should he leave\r\nAntler Hill in company with that personage, you will permit him to\r\ngo unhindered on his way. Should he leave alone and seek to return\r\nin the direction of the military quarters, or the palace, then your\r\ninstructions are different. Do you understand thus far?”\r\n\r\n“Fully, Milord!” answered Captain Bagley.\r\n\r\n“Should he start to return,” continued Lord Ashley, “he cannot possibly\r\ndo so until sixteen o’clock, or later. The moment sixteen o’clock has\r\nsounded and you find him upon the return journey, you will come upon\r\nhim and shoot him dead. You understand?”\r\n\r\n“Fully!” repeated Captain Bagley.\r\n\r\n“Your excuse will be that he was an escaping prisoner and that your\r\nlife was in danger. For the rest, you may look to me to protect you\r\nfully in your action.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Bagley bowed.\r\n\r\n“You notice here,” continued Lord Ashley, pointing to an instrument\r\nbeside the wall, with a large reflector above it, “the sigmagraph. As\r\nyou know, it is used to signal the guard house to turn out a guard\r\nof honor and salute when some visitor of rank is about to leave the\r\nChancellerie. Five flashes of the sigmagraph are the signal for the\r\nguard; any smaller number are mere test signals. At sixteen o’clock,\r\nprecisely to the last stroke, you will turn your eyes to the signal\r\nreceiver upon the roof of the military quarters. Should no signal come,\r\nyou will follow out the instructions given. Should you notice three\r\nflashes from the sigmagraph, then your orders are cancelled and the\r\nescaping prisoner is to be permitted to pass unhindered. Are these\r\ninstructions clear to you?”\r\n\r\n“Entirely, Milord!” answered Captain Bagley.\r\n\r\n“And I can count upon your faithful and discreet performance?”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely, Milord!”\r\n\r\n“It is well, then,” said Lord Ashley. “Remember that neither His\r\nMajesty, nor the Chancellerie, is unmindful of service and that due\r\nreward attends those who serve His Majesty and His Majesty’s Government\r\nfaithfully and well. No better service can be done than to exterminate,\r\nif needs be, traitors and hatchers of treason. I make myself clear to\r\nyou in this?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing could be clearer, Milord!”\r\n\r\n“It would not astonish me, Captain, to see you one day at the head of a\r\nDivision.”\r\n\r\n“I shall ever strive to earn your approval, Milord Chancellor!” replied\r\nCaptain Bagley, as he saluted and retired.\r\n\r\nWhile Lord Ashley was thus occupied in issuing instructions Mr. Kearns\r\nwas busily engaged in endeavoring to get in touch with the King. After\r\ndiligent inquiry, he ascertained that His Majesty had left the City\r\nPalace and was then upon the return journey. It was, however, not His\r\nMajesty’s intention to return direct, but to stop en route at Fairoaks,\r\nthe country estate of Sir Foxhall Sharpe, some thirty miles from the\r\nSummer Palace, where a garden-party to be attended by the King, the\r\nQueen and the Court was to be held that afternoon. It was rumored\r\nin Court circles that the real attraction of the garden-party was a\r\ncertain Miss Cameron, to whom recently had been drawn the attention of\r\nthe King. The Queen, it was said, had in consequence of the presence\r\nof this Miss Cameron among the guests been with difficulty induced to\r\nlend her presence, only consenting finally in order to prevent the\r\nappearance of a public scandal.\r\n\r\nKearns secured a phaeromobile from the royal garage and hurried off\r\nto Fairoaks, passing as he went a number of court mobiles on the way\r\nto the garden-party. Reaching Fairoaks, he found that the King had\r\narrived, but had retired to rest after his journey. His Majesty had\r\ngiven orders that he was not to be disturbed.\r\n\r\nIt was only after a long and weary wait of more than two hours that\r\nKearns succeeded in getting his urgent message to the King. His Majesty\r\nsent for him at once, but received him with some show of impatience.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the King, “we assume that your case is completed at last\r\nand that it must be both interesting and important to be forced upon\r\nour attention at the present time!”\r\n\r\n“The case is fully completed, Sire,” answered Kearns, “and in\r\nimportance will not, I think, disappoint your expectations. I am\r\nprepared to report now.”\r\n\r\n“Not now,” interrupted the King. “We would prefer to learn the details\r\nat the palace--upon our return.”\r\n\r\n“But the matters I have to impart, Sire, are most pressing--most\r\nurgent!”\r\n\r\n“So are matters here,” exclaimed the King, with a peculiar smile.\r\n“Certain rumors--as wicked as they are unfounded--have, it has\r\nreached our ears, been set afloat and have deeply shocked us. It has\r\nbecome necessary by our presence here, and that of Her Majesty, to\r\ndiscountenance these scandalous gossipings.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kearns could accommodate his intelligence to that which was\r\nrequired of him as well as the next man. He accordingly contrived to\r\ninject into his countenance the necessary quantum of astonishment and\r\nindignation and having done this, he promptly returned to the charge.\r\n\r\n“It becomes my duty to report to you, Sire,” he said, “that danger\r\nthreatens and that an armed attack is projected.”\r\n\r\nIt was the King’s turn to look startled and astonished.\r\n\r\n“When?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Possibly within three days.”\r\n\r\n“Are you sure of this?”\r\n\r\n“Positive!”\r\n\r\n“And can you confirm your facts?”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely.”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“Through Captain Stanley Mortimer and another.”\r\n\r\n“You are sure of this?”\r\n\r\n“Entirely so.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!”\r\n\r\nThe King remained for a moment in deep thought.\r\n\r\n“Three days,” he murmured. “That will give all the time required for\r\nany concentration of our forces which may be necessary. Two hours\r\ncannot make much difference in these preparations. We will remain here\r\nfor that time and then return to the palace.”\r\n\r\n“In view of the character of my information,” persisted Kearns, “I\r\nurge you, Sire, to the utmost expedition. I beg you to release Captain\r\nMortimer at once and to send for him and hear his story.”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered the King, “to leave here thus suddenly would create much\r\nundesirable speculation and gossip. This you shall do. We will sign the\r\norder for Captain Mortimer’s release, which you shall bear to him at\r\nonce. Direct him to repair to the palace and hold himself in readiness\r\nfor an immediate audience. When you have done this, you will hasten\r\nback here and report. By that time we shall be prepared to return to\r\nour palace and listen to the full details of this news. You may now go\r\nand carry out these instructions.”\r\n\r\n“You have not yet given me, Sire, the order for Captain Mortimer’s\r\nrelease.”\r\n\r\nThe King crossed to a writing-table, hastily wrote the requisite order\r\nand handed it to Kearns.\r\n\r\n“We would not lightly affront our Chancellor,” he said. “You will,\r\ntherefore, keep Captain Mortimer discreetly out of sight until\r\nour return and until we have gathered from his story whether this\r\nrelease is fully warranted by the facts. Should you chance to meet\r\nour Chancellor, tell him nothing of this release, but bid him summon\r\nGeneral Pierson, in command of the First Army Corps, to the palace.\r\nGo now, and upon your return here you will find us fully ready to\r\nproceed.”\r\n\r\nKearns bowed and retired. He made his way through the gardens, and,\r\nstepping into his phaeromobile, started on the return journey to the\r\npalace.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Kearns passed through the gardens of Fairoaks, he had noticed\r\namong the guests Miss Dorothy Brandon and Miss Beatrice Cuming. They\r\nalso had seen him and had bowed. Just as Kearns passed out of the\r\ngrounds, Lady Hill, one of Her Majesty’s ladies-in-waiting, came\r\nhurrying forward and greeted Dorothy.\r\n\r\n“I have been looking all over for you,” said Lady Hill. “I bring you an\r\norder from the Queen.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?” answered Dorothy. “What is it?”\r\n\r\n“You are to return at once to the palace,” said Lady Hill, “and present\r\nyourself at the Chancellerie. The Chancellor desires to see you upon\r\nurgent matters.”\r\n\r\nDorothy seemed both startled and astonished.\r\n\r\n“The Chancellor desires to see me!” she exclaimed. “What can it be\r\nabout? I would prefer not to go.”\r\n\r\n“Not go!” answered Lady Hill, who was a great stickler for etiquette,\r\nevidently quite shocked. “Why, my dear, this is a royal command I bring\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“But what can the Chancellor want to see me about?” persisted Dorothy.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” replied Lady Hill, “except that it is a matter of\r\nstate. The Chancellor’s request was addressed to the Queen, in the\r\nusual form--you being attached to Her Majesty’s suite--and the\r\nChancellor urgently asks your attendance at once. The Queen, of course,\r\nimmediately gave this order which I bring you.”\r\n\r\n“I would much prefer not to go,” said Dorothy.\r\n\r\n“But for what reason?” demanded Lady Hill.\r\n\r\n“Oh, it would be much nicer to remain here,” answered Dorothy vaguely.\r\n“Don’t you think I might seek audience with the Queen and ask her to\r\nwithdraw the order?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not!” said Lady Hill severely. “Such a proceeding would be\r\nentirely improper and contrary to Court etiquette.”\r\n\r\n“Well, but could I not,” persisted Dorothy, “endeavor to arrange this\r\nmatter, whatever it is, with the Chancellor over the audiphone?”\r\n\r\n“I am not familiar with the etiquette of the Chancellor,” said Lady\r\nHill frostily; “but I fancy that the Chancellor does not usually\r\ndiscuss matters of state over the audiphone. As a maid of honor\r\nattached to Her Majesty’s suite, it is your duty not to quibble over\r\nthe orders of the Sovereign, but to obey.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” answered Dorothy resignedly. “I shall go at once. Will you\r\ncome with me, Trixy?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, my dear,” replied Beatrice.\r\n\r\n“It’s too bad we have to go,” remarked Dorothy as they made their way\r\nthrough the grounds. “I understand there is going to be a splendid\r\nentertainment given later in the afternoon under the supervision of Sir\r\nRichard Hollowboy, the famous Director of Plastics.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is indeed too bad!” assented Beatrice.\r\n\r\n“Well,” continued Dorothy, “I did my best to get out of it.”\r\n\r\n“You certainly did,” acquiesced Beatrice, “but there’s no escape. Well,\r\ndon’t let’s mind! What can’t be cured must be endured, I suppose!”\r\n\r\nThey reached the highway, stepped into their victoriamobile and were\r\noff. And thus it happened that the two ladies were following Mr. Kearns\r\non the highway leading back to the palace.\r\n\r\nAs for Mr. Kearns he traveled back at a rate of speed which, unused\r\nas he was to such celerity in an open vehicle of this description,\r\nsuggested to him ideas that should any sudden breakdown, or other\r\nmishap occur there would be little left of him or the vehicle from\r\nwhich to pick out the tale. He experienced, however, a sense of\r\nbuoyancy and exhilaration from this rapid flashing through the air. He\r\nwas glad, though, of the wise provision which divided the Northbound\r\nand Southbound roads, thus obviating at least any possibility of\r\ncollision.\r\n\r\nWithout accident or further adventure he reached the Palace Park and\r\nspringing out of the phaeromobile, he ordered the man in charge to\r\nhold himself in readiness for the return journey to Fairoaks. Striding\r\nrapidly toward the military quarters, he was within a few steps of the\r\nmain entrance when, to his unbounded astonishment, he saw advancing\r\ntoward him Captain Stanley Mortimer.\r\n\r\n“How is it you are here?” exclaimed Mr. Kearns in amazement.\r\n\r\n“I’ve just been favored with an order of release,” said Mortimer,\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n“How did you manage it?” asked Kearns.\r\n\r\n“I don’t quite know, except that the order was from the King,” answered\r\nMortimer. “But come this way; I’ve something to show you.”\r\n\r\nHe passed his arm through that of Kearns and led him a short distance\r\naway from the military quarters and out into the park.\r\n\r\n“This whole affair has happened in a most curious way,” he said. “A few\r\nminutes ago I was notified of the arrival of the order of release and\r\nat the same time this note was given me. It’s really quite curious!\r\nRead for yourself!”\r\n\r\nKearns took the paper handed to him and read:\r\n\r\n“When these lines reach you, they will be accompanied by an order for\r\nyour release. This order has been secured by a true and devoted friend,\r\nwho desires to see you at once for the purpose of conveying to you\r\ninformation which it is of the highest importance you should learn at\r\nonce. The moment you are released proceed to the summer-house on Antler\r\nHill, where you will find this friend anxiously awaiting you. You ought\r\nto reach there by sixteen o’clock or a little earlier.”\r\n\r\nTwice Mr. Kearns read the note over carefully and then paused\r\nthoughtfully for some moments.\r\n\r\n“Well!” he said at last.\r\n\r\n“Well--what?” exclaimed Captain Mortimer questioningly.\r\n\r\n“What are you going to do?” asked Kearns.\r\n\r\n“Why,” exclaimed Mortimer in some astonishment, “I’m going to Antler\r\nHill, I suppose. Why should I not go?”\r\n\r\n“Because I scent a trap of some kind!” replied Kearns with conviction.\r\n\r\n“A trap!” exclaimed Mortimer. “You do, eh?”\r\n\r\n“Yes!”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m astonished,” exclaimed Mortimer, “but I do not know that\r\nI should hold back. If a friend awaits me there, I wouldn’t like to\r\nappear ungrateful, and if it is, as you suspect, an enemy, I’ve never\r\nyet hesitated to meet my enemies. What makes you think it is a trap?”\r\n\r\n“Why so much mystery about this missive? Why is it unsigned? Why should\r\nthis friend conceal his name from you?” asked Kearns vehemently.\r\n\r\n“Well,” answered Mortimer musingly, “there is some force in what you\r\nsay, and yet one can imagine reasons why a friend might not sign such a\r\ncommunication, especially when his identity is about to be revealed in\r\nthe course of an hour.”\r\n\r\n“You say the order of release was from the King?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then I can assure you,” continued Kearns earnestly, “there is\r\nsomething wrong about this whole transaction. I have here, as you see,\r\nan order for your release given direct into my hands by the King. I\r\ncame here in all haste the moment after receiving it. I am convinced\r\nthat the King has issued no other order of the same kind and that there\r\nis something wrong in connection with that other order which released\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“This looks indeed strange!” admitted Mortimer, with a serious air.\r\n\r\n“Furthermore,” resumed Kearns, “when the King gave me that order, it\r\nwas entrusted to me with the condition that I keep you quietly in the\r\nbackground until the King received you in audience and judged matters\r\nfor himself. I accepted the order under this condition and I feel bound\r\nby it.”\r\n\r\n“That entirely alters the complexion of matters,” declared Mortimer. “I\r\nwould not willingly by any act of mine place you in a false position.\r\nBut won’t you go to Antler Hill and explain to the person who may be\r\nwaiting there why it is I am unable to appear in person? Any danger\r\nwhich may await me would surely not extend to you.”\r\n\r\n“I would only too gladly go,” replied Kearns, “but I’m ordered to\r\nreturn to the King as soon as I have you in readiness for the coming\r\naudience. I don’t care to send another to the summer-house, though I am\r\nmost curious to learn who may be the person awaiting you there.”\r\n\r\n“And so am I!”\r\n\r\n“Well, don’t worry,” retorted Kearns. “Friend or foe, you may depend\r\nupon it we shall discover who that person is before long. As you know,\r\nI have had some experience in matters of this kind.”\r\n\r\n“What is it, then, you wish me to do now?” asked Mortimer.\r\n\r\n“Accompany me to the palace,” replied Kearns. “I shall leave you in\r\nmy private bureau in the Chancellerie until the time comes for your\r\naudience with the King.”\r\n\r\n“I am at your disposition,” answered Mortimer simply.\r\n\r\n“One question I want to ask you,” said Kearns. “Have you communicated\r\nwith anybody since your return?”\r\n\r\n“With no one,” replied Mortimer. “I was naturally not anxious to\r\nadvertise the fact of my being under arrest.”\r\n\r\n“That was very wise,” remarked Kearns. “Now let us go.”\r\n\r\nThey accordingly made their way direct to the palace and entered\r\nKearns’s bureau off the main room of the Chancellerie.\r\n\r\n“Now,” exclaimed Kearns, “I invite you to make yourself as comfortable\r\nas possible here until audience time comes. It will be only a couple of\r\nhours or so.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” assented Mortimer cheerfully.\r\n\r\n“More than this,” continued Kearns, “knowing your propensity for\r\nrunning into adventures of various kinds and in view of my promise to\r\nthe King, I am going to ask you to pledge me your word of honor that\r\nyou won’t leave this room during the next two hours.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” demurred Mortimer, smiling; “that’s a hard promise to exact. Who\r\ncan tell what may turn up within two hours?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” assented Kearns, “I will allow you to make your promise with\r\nthe qualification: Except in case of possible life or death. I have,\r\nthen, your word?”\r\n\r\n“Have it your own way, since you insist,” exclaimed Mortimer. “Yes; you\r\nhave my word that I will not cross the threshold of this room within\r\nthe next two hours, unless it is a question of possible life or death.”\r\n\r\n“Now I can proceed upon my errand with a mind at ease,” said Kearns,\r\nwith a satisfied air. “Oh, by the way, I had almost forgotten! I have a\r\nmessage from the King for Lord Ashley.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he walked to the door of communication, pushed aside the\r\nheavy portiere, opened the door, threw aside the corresponding portiere\r\non the other side and passed into the main room of the Chancellerie.\r\n\r\nA moment later he returned, with preoccupied air.\r\n\r\n“Nobody there!” he exclaimed. “It’s a holiday and everybody has taken\r\nadvantage of it. Well, I’m off to Fairoaks now. Within two hours I\r\nexpect I shall be back and--so will the King!” With these words he\r\nhurried from the room and away.\r\n\r\nAfter Kearns’s departure, Mortimer strolled to the window and looked\r\nover the park. Then he stretched himself out comfortably with a book\r\nand read. He had been reading but a very short time, when voices came\r\nto him from the adjoining main room of the Chancellerie. An instant\r\nlater he sprang to his feet, a flood of color flushing his face. In\r\nreturning from the Chancellerie to his bureau, Mr. Kearns had failed\r\nfully to close the door of communication and now only the two portieres\r\nintervened between the rooms. Do what he would, Mortimer could not but\r\nhear.\r\n\r\nMore distinctly came the voices to him, as the minutes passed. He\r\nstood with strained features and eyes ablaze. Then his hand flew to his\r\nsword-hilt and he strode forward. Two steps he took and abruptly halted.\r\n\r\nMerciful God! Why was he thus chained here? Why had he pledged his\r\nword, except under stress of possible life or death, not to cross the\r\nthreshold of this room?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nIN THE CHANCELLERIE\r\n\r\n\r\n“His Excellency, the Chancellor, desires to see Miss Brandon upon\r\nofficial business and alone,” said the messenger.\r\n\r\n“You will wait for me, Trixy?” asked Dorothy of her companion.\r\n\r\n“I have a letter to send off, dear,” answered Beatrice, “and I will go\r\nto your desk and write it. I suppose you will be back to me before I\r\nhave finished.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” assented Dorothy, with preoccupied air, as she turned to\r\nthe messenger and indicated her readiness to follow him.\r\n\r\nLord Ashley received her in the main room of the Chancellerie. The\r\nmessenger who ushered her in withdrew, and they were alone.\r\n\r\nLord Ashley advanced with deferential courtesy to receive her and led\r\nher to a seat at the head of a long, highly-polished table in the\r\ncentre of the room. He drew up a chair and seated himself at the side\r\nof the table, in order to bring himself almost face to face with her.\r\n\r\n“I must beg your forgiveness, Miss Brandon,” he began, “for having thus\r\nhastily asked your attendance. I trust you will not regret too much\r\nhaving missed the pleasures of the garden-party.”\r\n\r\n“I confess,” answered Dorothy, “I was astonished upon learning the\r\nurgency of your summons and quite unable to guess its cause. Even now\r\nI--”\r\n\r\n“You are still at a loss,” rejoined Lord Ashley promptly, as she\r\nhesitated. “It may be summed up in two words--official business.”\r\n\r\n“Official business!” repeated Dorothy. “So the message said. But what\r\npossible connection can there be between me and the official business\r\nof the Chancellerie?”\r\n\r\n“It does seem peculiar, doesn’t it?” laughed Lord Ashley pleasantly,\r\n“but that is precisely what I am about to explain to you. There is\r\na matter regarding which you can, perhaps, furnish me with some\r\ninformation--information which has only an indirect bearing, no doubt,\r\nbut which may possibly be of some value to His Majesty’s Government.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed? To what does this matter relate?”\r\n\r\n“It is connected with the recent disappearance of Captain Stanley\r\nMortimer.”\r\n\r\nDorothy started and perceptibly changed color.\r\n\r\n“You astonish me!” she exclaimed. “In what way can I possibly assist\r\nyou in this?”\r\n\r\n“You remember the occasion of the last Court ball?” asked Lord Ashley.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“That night was also the occasion of the wounding of Captain Swords and\r\nof the disappearance of Captain Mortimer, as you will recall.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“The last known appearance in public of Captain Mortimer,” continued\r\nLord Ashley, “was at the ball, where he had the honor of dancing with\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he danced with me.”\r\n\r\n“After which,” resumed Lord Ashley, “you both made the customary\r\npromenade and conversed together.”\r\n\r\n“We passed into the royal conservatory.”\r\n\r\n“So that,” said Lord Ashley, with a pleasant smile, “you are the last\r\nperson with whom Captain Mortimer is known to have been seen on that\r\neventful night.”\r\n\r\n“I was not aware of that.”\r\n\r\n“Such is the case, however.”\r\n\r\n“Well, even so, what then----?”\r\n\r\n“Simply this,” replied Lord Ashley, with the same pleasant smile;\r\n“it has been deemed advisable to ask you if, in the course of his\r\nconversation with you that evening, Captain Mortimer permitted any\r\nremarks to fall which would tend to throw light upon his subsequent\r\ndisappearance.”\r\n\r\nDorothy paused, hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n“Was he not engaged that night upon some special service for the King?”\r\nshe asked.\r\n\r\n“Engaged upon special service for the King!” exclaimed Lord Ashley,\r\nwith a mocking laugh. “No; I regret to say that he was engaged upon\r\nvery different service.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand, Milord.”\r\n\r\n“Then I will make myself perfectly clear,” said Lord Ashley, with\r\nemphasis. “Far from being engaged in His Majesty’s service that night,\r\nCaptain Mortimer was conspiring with and aiding the enemies of the\r\nKing.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, monstrous!” exclaimed Dorothy with agitation. “I am convinced\r\nthere is no truth in this.”\r\n\r\n“I would that I could join you in this belief,” said Lord Ashley\r\nbitterly, “for the sake of the reputation of the army in general and of\r\nthe Guards in particular. Unfortunately, the proofs in possession of\r\nHis Majesty’s government are conclusive. Captain Mortimer has been led\r\nfrom the path of his duty to King and Government--has been led to his\r\nruin--by yielding to temptations extended by the King’s enemies.”\r\n\r\n“I am convinced there is some mistake,” replied Dorothy. There was a\r\nnumb sensation in her brain and at her heart, yet she spoke the words\r\nbravely.\r\n\r\n“Mistake!” repeated Lord Ashley. “Alas, no! The Government has in its\r\npossession proofs establishing Captain Mortimer’s connection with\r\ncertain revolutionary factions to which he has given information and\r\nactive aid. A search of his quarters subsequent to his disappearance\r\nrevealed the presence of plans of fortifications and schedules as\r\nto the disposition of His Majesty’s forces of a most compromising\r\ncharacter.”\r\n\r\nDorothy had recovered from the first shock of the Chancellor’s\r\ndisclosures and all her senses were now alert.\r\n\r\n“It does not seem probable,” she said slowly, “that a person about to\r\ndisappear would leave all these compromising matters behind, when it\r\nwould have been so easy to have destroyed them.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” retorted Lord Ashley quickly, “but this disappearance was not\r\npremeditated. The necessity for it arose suddenly and in an unforeseen\r\nmanner.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” continued Lord Ashley. “Captain Mortimer was involved in the\r\nvarious scandalous attempts which have been made at times upon the\r\npeace and dignity of His Majesty--attempts involving the depositing of\r\nthreatening and seditious documents in the royal apartments. Upon the\r\noccasion of the last of these attempts, Captain Mortimer had reason to\r\nbelieve he was recognized and his acts discovered by the officer on\r\nduty that night; hence the attempted assassination of Captain Swords\r\nand the sudden disappearance which followed.”\r\n\r\nDorothy sank back in her chair, white and trembling.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” she exclaimed with emotion, “you accuse him of murder as well as\r\nof treason!”\r\n\r\n“Such are the facts to which the proofs in the possession of the\r\nGovernment point,” answered Lord Ashley impressively.\r\n\r\n“But,” said Dorothy, gathering her courage and fighting on bravely,\r\n“what possible motive could Captain Mortimer have for doing these\r\nthings? He is a soldier with a brilliant record; he holds an enviable\r\nposition in the army; why should he do these things? What motive could\r\nthere be?”\r\n\r\n“There are circumstances and temptations which lie so far apart from\r\nyou and your life, Miss Brandon,” said Lord Ashley with an air of\r\ngreat candor, “that they are difficult to explain to you, and it is\r\nnot wonderful that you should not understand them. These revolutionary\r\nmovements are backed by men of large means, who have their own personal\r\naims and ambitions. In addition to this, there are the subscriptions of\r\ndisaffected masses which, when lumped together, run into vast sums. The\r\nReactionist cause, I can assure you, does not lack money.”\r\n\r\n“I follow your words, but I don’t fully understand their import,” said\r\nDorothy.\r\n\r\n“I will be more explicit,” rejoined Lord Ashley. “You asked me what\r\ncould be the motive for Captain Mortimer’s acts, and I answer you\r\nby saying that there are ample funds at the disposition of these\r\nrevolutionists, who do not hesitate to purchase treason. Money--that\r\nmagnet of temptation which has led astray so many men--was the motive.\r\nCaptain Mortimer, like many other officers of the army, was addicted to\r\nheavy play; he was pressed for money and it was with money that he was\r\ndebauched.”\r\n\r\n“Are there no limits to the calumnies--no depths to the infamies\r\ncharged?” cried Dorothy with indignation and despair.\r\n\r\n“It does sound infamous,” replied Lord Ashley gravely, “so infamous\r\nas to seem, to an upright mind like yours, almost incredible. But\r\nsuch are the facts, and these facts, as I have already had the honor\r\nof apprizing you, are supported by proofs in the possession of the\r\nGovernment.”\r\n\r\n“But so-called proof at times turns out to be error,” retorted Dorothy.\r\n\r\n“There are, it is true, various grades of proof,” replied Lord Ashley\r\nwith judicial solemnity. “In this case, the proofs in the hands of the\r\nGovernment are convincing. They are absolute and incontestable. There\r\nis no error.”\r\n\r\nFor one brief instant Dorothy sat irresolute. Here was the Chancellor\r\nof the Empire--a man of responsibility and power--assuring her that\r\nthere were incontestable proofs of guilt. He told, with judicial\r\ncalmness and force, a story detailed and circumstantial of conspiracy\r\nand treason and the motive therefor. For the second time this tale of\r\npassion for play had reached her. What was she to believe? What should\r\nbe her decision? Ah! the answer to her was easy; only for the briefest\r\ninstant did she hesitate! How false the first accusation had proved!\r\nHad he not looked into her eyes, in the gardens of the King, and had\r\nshe not felt that only honor and truth lay behind his refuting words?\r\nHow she had reproached herself then for her lack of faith! Never again\r\nwould she dishonor him with one thought of mistrust. Let circumstances\r\nbe what they would, let suspicion point as it might, never again would\r\nshe permit herself the slightest doubt! She raised her head and looked\r\nkeenly at Lord Ashley.\r\n\r\n“During this interview,” she said, “you have spoken of treason, of\r\nattempted murder and of mercenariness. You say there are proofs of\r\nthese things. I can only answer you that I am convinced these proofs\r\nare false. Does Captain Swords, for instance, assert that it was\r\nCaptain Mortimer who fired that shot?”\r\n\r\n“Captain Swords did not see his assailant, although his assailant\r\ndoubtless thought he did,” answered Lord Ashley. “Besides, Captain\r\nSwords is as deceived as to the true character of Captain Mortimer as\r\nothers have been.”\r\n\r\n“You will have to count me, then, among the friends who believe\r\nsteadfastly in him as the soul of loyalty and honor!” said Dorothy with\r\nspirit. “I don’t suppose,” she continued, “I can dissuade you from the\r\nopinions you have formed, and I am very sure that you cannot change\r\nmine on this subject. It is painful to me to hear one whom I respect\r\nfalsely accused, and I don’t see what can well be gained by further\r\ndiscussing this matter. In fact, Milord, I don’t quite understand\r\nwhy--why--this interview was sought.”\r\n\r\n“I have already tendered my apologies,” replied Lord Ashley gently,\r\n“and explained that you were the last person with whom Captain Mortimer\r\nwas seen. The Government is desirous of learning whether, during the\r\nconversation with you upon that occasion, Captain Mortimer permitted\r\nany remark to escape him which might throw any light upon the matter of\r\nthis disappearance, or other acts of his.”\r\n\r\n“Captain Mortimer indulged in no such remark,” answered Dorothy briefly.\r\n\r\n“But you have already said that he told you he was engaged that night\r\nupon some special service for the King,” persisted Lord Ashley.\r\n\r\n“He did say he was engaged that night upon some special service, but\r\nI am not sure that he added it was for the King. That, I think, was a\r\nmere inference on my part.”\r\n\r\n“And a very natural inference under the circumstances,” replied Lord\r\nAshley with warmth, “but the assertion was false!”\r\n\r\n“I know nothing except the bare statement made to me,” answered Dorothy.\r\n\r\n“Will you not narrate the circumstances which led up to that\r\nstatement?” asked Lord Ashley. “Will you not detail the entire\r\nconversation which took place between you? You see,” he added, “there\r\nmay have been words with little meaning for you, which nevertheless\r\nwould mean much for the officers of His Majesty’s Government, in view\r\nof the facts which they know and the clues which they possess.”\r\n\r\nDorothy hesitated an instant.\r\n\r\n“I have said to you,” she replied, “that no such remarks passed between\r\nus.”\r\n\r\n“I have explained that you are scarcely in a position to judge\r\naccurately as to this,” went on Lord Ashley inexorably. “Will you not\r\nrepeat, for the benefit of the Government, the conversation which\r\noccurred, so that the Government may judge for itself as to this\r\nmatter?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Dorothy coldly. “The conversation was of a private\r\ncharacter--one with which the Government has no concern. I have assured\r\nyou that no remarks such as you seek were made. Beyond this I will not\r\ngo!”\r\n\r\n“Then I am to understand,” said Lord Ashley regretfully, “that you\r\nprefer to render possible aid to this traitor rather than to the King\r\nand Queen from whom you hold a post of honor and whom you profess to\r\nserve?”\r\n\r\n“I reject the charge of treachery as to myself, as I do the name\r\ntraitor as applied to Captain Mortimer,” replied Dorothy with spirit.\r\n“Your insinuation of disloyalty on my part,” she added sadly, “is\r\nunjust--undeserved. I serve the Queen honestly and loyally. To her I\r\nwould willingly repeat what I here refuse to say.”\r\n\r\n“Do not be angry with me!” exclaimed Lord Ashley warmly, drawing nearer\r\nto her. “I meant no offense, but I was carried away by my feelings. It\r\ndistresses me to see you--whose regard would do an emperor honor--place\r\ntrust in and defend a renegade and traitor--a scoundrel who has been\r\nfalse to his King.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” exclaimed Dorothy, shrinking back, “this is terrible! I have told\r\nyou I do not believe--I do not believe!”\r\n\r\n“Listen, then,” cried Lord Ashley, pressing still nearer, “and learn\r\nnow the full truth. He has been captured and is at this minute a\r\nprisoner--in close confinement--in the military quarters.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” exclaimed Dorothy with excitement, “he will have an opportunity\r\nof speaking for himself, and the truth will stand forth!”\r\n\r\n“He has spoken! The truth is out!”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“He has confessed--confessed to his treason!”\r\n\r\n“Impossible--oh, impossible!” cried Dorothy distractedly.\r\n\r\n“I tell you it is so,” continued Lord Ashley vehemently, “and still\r\nmore will I tell you. As a reward for this confession, which has\r\nimplicated others and given the Government much valuable information,\r\nand also to save the Guards’ corps from the shame of having harbored a\r\nscoundrel and a traitor, he is not to be made to suffer the penalty of\r\nhis crimes. I have permitted an arrangement to be made for his escape,\r\nand he has gladly acquiesced.”\r\n\r\n“You say he has acquiesced to such a thing!” exclaimed Dorothy with an\r\nair of bewilderment.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” retorted Lord Ashley, “and is at this moment on his way to some\r\nplace of security and oblivion. Now, I beg you to listen to me,” he\r\ncontinued with fervor. “I beseech you--I implore you--to put from your\r\nmind all further thought of this man, whose name is unworthy of mention\r\nin your presence. He has merited death, but has escaped with shame as\r\nhis portion henceforth. Let us dismiss him from our thoughts. There is\r\nanother and more honorable matter regarding which I would speak to you.\r\nMiss Brandon--Dorothy--I love you!”\r\n\r\n“Milord----”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I love you,” he continued, with the abandon of a man carried\r\naway by the force of his feelings, “and I offer you a union which\r\nthe proudest woman in the realm might find worthy of acceptance. His\r\nMajesty, the King, has already signified to me that my appointment\r\nas Lord Chancellor is to be followed shortly by my elevation to the\r\nPeerage. In fact, I may confide to you that the form of such title has\r\nalready been selected.”\r\n\r\n“Milord, I----”\r\n\r\n“Nay, hear me to the end,” he continued with passionate fervor; “it\r\nis more than mere title which I have to offer. As wife of a Lord\r\nChancellor who will know how to extend the influence and power of his\r\nhigh office, you will find yourself in a position of social supremacy\r\nwhich will place you second only to the Queen herself. At a word from\r\nyou, social careers will be made or marred; at a nod of approval\r\nfrom you, a fashion will spring into life, or be set aside. Men of\r\nthe world and men of the Court will respect and fear your power,\r\nwhile women will fawn and flatter for your favor. Rank, title, power,\r\ninfluence--all these I offer you, and, moreover, boundless devotion and\r\nimmeasurable love. What can I give more?”\r\n\r\nHe paused and waited. Dorothy sat with bowed head and shifting color\r\nand made no sign. Could this, Ashley wondered, be the silence of\r\nrejection, or was it merely the hesitation natural to maidenly reserve?\r\nReared throughout his life among soldiers and statesmen possessed\r\nof aims and ambitions, himself possessed of a boundless lust for\r\npreferment and power, Lord Ashley’s tendency was to regard ambition as\r\nthe all-alluring fetish, the resistless lever, with which to sway human\r\nimpulse and human action. Furthermore, his actual experiences in his\r\nimmediate surroundings had tended to impress him with the accuracy of\r\nthis theory. What he had offered was sufficiently brilliant, as he had\r\nsaid, to be worthy of the acceptance of the proudest woman in the land.\r\nNor had he overstated his case. He was really in a position to give all\r\nhe tendered. She would surely not refuse! What woman would? At last she\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n“I fully realize, Milord, the extent of all you have been good enough\r\nto offer me,” she said, “and I appreciate the honor you do me. I am\r\nglad, too, to learn of the new distinctions which await you and pleased\r\nto be the first to congratulate you.”\r\n\r\n“And you accept?” he cried joyfully, as he bent nearer to her. “You\r\nwill say--yes?”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” she exclaimed hastily, as she shrunk back; “I cannot--I\r\ncannot--accept.”\r\n\r\n“You--cannot--accept!” he cried blankly. “And--why?”\r\n\r\nShe remained silent.\r\n\r\n“Why?” he repeated.\r\n\r\nStill there was no answer.\r\n\r\n“You are not pledged to another?”\r\n\r\n“Surely that is something you should not ask.”\r\n\r\n“But I do ask it,” he cried vehemently, springing to his feet, his\r\nface pale with anger. “Do you think I am blind--that I cannot surmise!\r\nYou have been bewitched by that traitor whose crimes I have laid bare\r\nbefore you. In spite of his misdeeds and his shame, you still cling\r\nto a mad infatuation, a wild hope, instead of accepting an honorable\r\nunion. It is the perversity which has marked and marred so many of your\r\nsex through the ages. But I am not a man to be thus flaunted and put\r\naside. This silly infatuation, this foolish love of yours can never be\r\nrealized, for it is given to one who is dead!”\r\n\r\n“Dead!” repeated Dorothy, turning pale to the lips. “What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! I’ll tell you!” said Lord Ashley, beside himself with anger. “This\r\nman deserved death, but the Government, on the score of policy, was\r\nopposed to the notoriety arising from his public trial and execution.\r\nIt was accordingly decided that he should be afforded opportunities\r\nof escape and that he should either be allowed to gain his freedom\r\nand hide his perfidy and shame in some obscure corner of the world,\r\nor else that the death he so well merited should be dealt out to him\r\nwhile effecting this escape--in other words, a private execution of\r\njustice in place of a public one. This question was referred to certain\r\nofficers of the Government, who in turn left the whole question to me.\r\nIn the goodness of my heart, I wavered and delayed my decision until\r\nthe last moment, making the execution dependent upon a certain signal\r\nto be given by me. At this very moment the man is escaping. His life\r\ndepends upon the signal which I shall give.”\r\n\r\n“But this is murder!” cried Dorothy desperately, springing to her feet.\r\n\r\n“It is a judicial execution,” said Lord Ashley sternly, “and one that\r\nwould be approved by every army officer and every loyalist in the\r\ncountry were the facts known.”\r\n\r\n“I will shout this infamy broadcast,” cried Dorothy, wild-eyed and\r\ngasping.\r\n\r\n“Bah!” exclaimed Lord Ashley with sarcasm, “your utterances will be\r\nknown merely as the wild ravings of an infatuated woman! What will they\r\nweigh against official declarations and the military reports as to the\r\nescape and what followed? Such utterances will simply bring notoriety\r\nand discredit upon you.”\r\n\r\n“Have you no mercy?”\r\n\r\n“None,” he answered inflexibly. “Hear me now for the last time. That\r\ninstrument against the wall yonder is a sigmagraph. A touch of its\r\nelectric button causes a flash of light to appear upon the reflector\r\nabove it, which is transmitted to the receiver upon the roof of the\r\nmilitary quarters. In just eight and one-half minutes, sixteen o’clock\r\nwill sound. If, before the last stroke dies away, three flashes of\r\nlight are cast from that reflector, mercy will have prevailed and the\r\ntraitor will be permitted to make good his escape. If no such signal be\r\ngiven he dies.”\r\n\r\n“This is horrible--horrible!” repeated Dorothy, aghast “You will surely\r\nshow mercy and not hold back that signal!”\r\n\r\n“Only upon one condition.”\r\n\r\n“And that is?” cried Dorothy desperately.\r\n\r\n“I am but human,” said Lord Ashley, speaking rapidly, “and to purchase\r\nmy happiness I will forego meting out strict justice. In the palace\r\nchapel, at this very moment, is the royal chaplain. At a command from\r\nme he can be in this room within two minutes; within two more the words\r\ncan be spoken which will constitute a binding ceremony. The brilliant\r\npublic ceremony can come later. Speak but the word. I will summon the\r\nchaplain and--this man lives. His fate is in your hands!”\r\n\r\n“No, no!” protested Dorothy, “I cannot--cannot!”\r\n\r\n“Then he dies!”\r\n\r\nLord Ashley turned aside. He drew a cigarette-case from his pocket,\r\nextracted a cigarette and, crossing the room to a side table, lighted\r\nit. Walking over to the sigmagraph, he took up his post with his back\r\nturned to it.\r\n\r\n“Four minutes only are left to you,” he said ominously, as he drew out\r\nhis watch.\r\n\r\nHis words came to his listener as an electric shock. She roused herself\r\nfrom her momentary lethargy and despair.\r\n\r\n“Will you not be moved to justice?” she cried. “Don’t you see that\r\nwhat you ask cannot be? I could never know happiness--never make you\r\nhappy. I should forever have this scene before my eyes--this scene of\r\nblood--of treachery!”\r\n\r\n“I have told you it is a judicial execution--none the less judicial and\r\nproper because justice is meted out privately rather than publicly.\r\nHigh affairs of state under all governments not infrequently demand\r\nsuch a course--a course which in reality shows undeserved mercy to him.”\r\n\r\n“Mercy! mercy! This you call mercy!”\r\n\r\n“It is the only mercy I will show him, unless----”\r\n\r\n“Don’t say this! You will not permit this wicked, treacherous deed! You\r\nwill save him! You will give the signal--say that you will give the\r\nsignal!”\r\n\r\n“Three minutes!”\r\n\r\n“No, no! Don’t count. You drive me mad! Is there nothing will move you\r\nto pity--nothing turn you from this----”\r\n\r\n“I’ve already told you. His fate lies with you!”\r\n\r\n“No, no--not that! This cannot--must not be! Anything but that----”\r\n\r\n“Then it is you who condemn him by your own act!”\r\n\r\n“My own act! I, who would gladly die to save him! But no, it is not\r\nmy act--not my act! I cannot--I will not do what will bring horror,\r\nmisery, degradation!”\r\n\r\n“You speak of a union with the Chancellor of the Realm as degradation?”\r\n\r\n“A union with any man when a woman’s whole heart and soul are given\r\nto another means misery, degradation. How can you ask it of me--how\r\nyourself consent! For I love him--I love him--I love only him!”\r\n\r\n“Two minutes!”\r\n\r\n“You don’t realize--you don’t understand! I tell you no, no, this\r\ncannot--this must not be. Anything else you ask, but not that! For your\r\nown happiness spare me--for your own conscience--your own future peace,\r\nsave him!”\r\n\r\n“Not all the angels in heaven, or devils in hell, shall turn me from my\r\npath! You are sacrificing everything to a woman’s whim. Time will teach\r\nyou forgetfulness of this folly and--love!”\r\n\r\n“A woman’s whim! Ah, the wise Chancellor understands so little of women\r\nthat he thinks them mere butterflies. But I say to you that when a\r\nwoman’s spirit is once profoundly stirred, she becomes more firm, more\r\nimplacable, than the sternest man among you all! Her love knows no\r\nmeasure, no reason, no calculation; her hate has no weakening. Were I\r\nto become your wife, I could never forget that the man I adore had been\r\ntorn from me by force and fraud. My thoughts would always be of him; my\r\nonly moments of happiness those when I closed my eyes and cheated my\r\nsenses with the dream that I lay within his arms. The honor, the rank,\r\nthe titles you offer me, would be nothing, for would they not have been\r\nbought at the price of his--of my--happiness! And you--I should hate\r\nyou!”\r\n\r\n“Less than one minute!”\r\n\r\n“Less than one minute! And you will permit this crime! You will let him\r\ngo to his death--my sweetheart--my handsome, gallant sweetheart! No,\r\nyou will not! You are too noble, too generous!”\r\n\r\n“You cannot move me!”\r\n\r\n“Do you not see that I shall go mad if you kill him? Say that you will\r\ngive the signal--that you will give the signal!”\r\n\r\n“Your last moment of opportunity is rapidly passing. Will you save him?”\r\n\r\n“O God--my God!”\r\n\r\n“Hear! the hour strikes!”\r\n\r\n“The signal--the signal! Give the signal!”\r\n\r\n“Not unless you pledge yourself before the last stroke sounds.”\r\n\r\n“The signal!”\r\n\r\n“Never!”\r\n\r\n“A-a-h!”\r\n\r\nWith a scream she turned suddenly and ran from him to the little table\r\nupon which stood the electric lighter. Over her shoulders was a light,\r\nloose scarf, which she had worn as part of her garden-party costume.\r\nShe tore it from her and thrust it into the flame of the electric\r\nlighter. In an instant the delicate material had caught the flames\r\nand, before Lord Ashley could divine her intention, she rushed to the\r\nsigmagraph’s indicator and upon its sensitized surface flashed the\r\nlight thrice; but not before her gown at sleeves and bosom caught in\r\nflame.\r\n\r\nLord Ashley, recovering from the first shock of surprise, sprang\r\ntoward her, dashed the burning scarf to the floor and with a few rapid\r\nmovements smothered the flames at work upon her frock.\r\n\r\n“What have you done?” he cried staring at the injury to her dainty\r\nwhite flesh. “Do you realize that you have placed your life in peril?”\r\n\r\nShe was dazed and half fainting from the pain of her injuries, and he\r\nsupported her to a divan at the further end of the apartment.\r\n\r\n“Do you realize what you have done?” he repeated.\r\n\r\nBut despite the pain, despite the fact that she felt her senses were\r\nleaving her, the thought of Mortimer’s safety was still uppermost in\r\nher mind.\r\n\r\n“The signal--the signal,” she moaned hysterically, “was the signal\r\ngiven in time? Is he safe? Oh, tell me that he is safe! See--see!”\r\n\r\nA shriek broke from her. She sat staring straight before her as one\r\nseized with a paralysis of fear.\r\n\r\nLord Ashley perceived the look; there was no mistaking its mingled\r\nhorror and fascinated fear. Abruptly he turned to ascertain its cause.\r\n\r\nThere within a few feet of him, with pallid features so distorted with\r\nrage as to be scarcely human, tall and majestic, the very embodiment of\r\nfury, his eyes ablaze with the sullen fires of vengeance, stood Captain\r\nStanley Mortimer. A situation releasing him from his promise--the\r\nquestion of life or death which alone permitted him to cross the\r\nthreshold of that room--had arisen. He now stood freed from his pledge.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the two men faced each other, glaring into each other’s\r\neyes. Then the torrent of wrath surging within Mortimer found an outlet\r\nin words.\r\n\r\n“Scoundrel! Liar!” he hissed between his set teeth.\r\n\r\n“What!” cried Lord Ashley, his anger kindling, as fire kindles amid\r\nstraw. “You dare to apply those epithets to me--the King’s Chancellor!”\r\n\r\n“It is as man to man that we now speak,” retorted Mortimer, struggling\r\nwith his rage. “Take your sword and defend your life!” He pointed\r\nacross the apartment and through the open doorway of Lord Ashley’s\r\nprivate bureau. Against the wall, amid a panoply of arms, could be seen\r\nhanging the sword which the Chancellor had used during the earlier days\r\nof the Russian war.\r\n\r\n“I refuse to fight you,” said Lord Ashley. “I shall summon the guard\r\nand have you returned to the confinement from which you have escaped.\r\nBefore you can claim the right to cross swords as an equal, you must\r\nfirst clear yourself of the stigma of treason which at present defiles\r\nyou!”\r\n\r\n“You refuse!” retorted Mortimer, with a gesture of contempt. “Your\r\nrefusal will avail you little. I will throttle you to death where you\r\nstand. What!” he continued, with biting sarcasm, “can it be possible\r\nthat the uniform of the Guards has at one time covered the breast of a\r\nliar, a traducer and a--_coward_!”\r\n\r\nAs this final word left Mortimer’s lips, Lord Ashley’s face in turn\r\nbecame suffused with rage. With all the faults, even crimes into which\r\nhis ambition had led him in the course of his pyramidal career, one\r\nvirtue was yet left him, that of physical courage. With a snarl of\r\nrage, he turned sharply and bounded across the room to where his sword\r\nhung. Back he ran, drawing the weapon and flinging the scabbard to one\r\nside as he advanced on Mortimer, awaiting him with drawn blade and\r\nthe light of battle in his eyes. Crouched in one corner of the divan,\r\nmoaning and hysterical, lay Dorothy.\r\n\r\nThe swords crossed with a clash. Mortimer was widely famed in the\r\nservice for his skill as a swordsman, but upon this occasion he\r\nwas fairly matched, and rarely could there have been seen a finer\r\nexhibition of swordsmanship. There were lightning feints and thrusts\r\nand parries, brilliant grand assaults and equally brilliant defenses\r\nupon either side. The black eyes of Ashley glared into the blue eyes\r\nof Mortimer, and each pair of eyes flashed forth the murder which was\r\nin the hearts behind them. Backward and forward they advanced and\r\nretreated, feinting and thrusting, slashing and parrying. At first,\r\nthe rage which possessed Mortimer had rendered him less cool and wary\r\nthan was to be desired, and so placed him at a slight disadvantage.\r\nTwice Ashley managed to touch lightly and these wounds, slight as they\r\nwere, served as a vent for Mortimer’s overwrought feelings and lent\r\nto him, in some degree, the necessary coolness and caution. He could\r\nfeel the blood trickling down his sleeve, as he skillfully parried a\r\nfierce assault. The tingling of the wounds in arm and shoulder came\r\npleasurably to his overwrought spirit. Suddenly he feinted toward the\r\nneck. Up flew Ashley’s weapon in defense. Then, swift as a shaft of\r\nlight, Mortimer’s sword-arm shot out in a straight and deadly thrust.\r\nIt passed just under Ashley’s guard, and the point of Mortimer’s sword\r\nwent home just below the median line. Such was the force and fury of\r\nthe thrust that Mortimer’s blade ran through to the hilt. With an\r\nupward fling of the arms, Ashley crashed backward to the floor, in a\r\nheap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE LAST STAND OF THE GUARDS\r\n\r\n\r\nA murmur--faint at first--gradually swelling until it merged into a\r\npositive cry of alarm! A strange confusion without the gates, which\r\nrapidly communicated to the grounds within; the sharp blasts of a\r\nbugle; shouts of command; the movements of men; cries, confusion--then\r\na panic among the guests and a promiscuous dash to gain the shelter\r\nof the mansion! It all came with the vividness and rapidity of a\r\nthunderbolt!\r\n\r\nThe garden-party at Fairoaks had promised well to be spoken of as\r\na red-letter social event. The guests had been royally amused. The\r\npresence of the King and Queen had lent a special luster to the\r\noccasion and then, too, there was the beautiful Miss Cameron, affording\r\nopportunity alike for observation and for gossip. The entertainment,\r\nunder the direction of Sir Richard Hollowboy, Imperial and Royal\r\nDirector of Pyrotechnics and Plastics, had been a huge success. Sir\r\nRichard had more than sustained his high reputation; upon this occasion\r\nhe had fairly eclipsed himself.\r\n\r\nAmong the features of Sir Richard’s entertainment were a series of what\r\nSir Richard was pleased to term, “Fifteen-o’clock Fireworks”--this\r\ndesignation being presumably intended to create the impression of\r\nfireworks by daylight. The “daylight fireworks,” as a matter of fact,\r\nconsisted of certain really wonderful smoke effects in the air,\r\nrepresenting extremely interesting and well-executed tableaux.\r\n\r\nOne of the most colossal reproductions was attracting the interest of\r\nthe guests when suddenly something of a most startling nature occurred.\r\nFrom all four points of the compass there appeared, as if coming\r\nfrom the sky itself, a number of strange aërial forms, which massed\r\nthemselves about the gigantic figure in the air and hovered directly\r\nabove the grounds of the garden-party. Fantastic forms of varying sizes\r\nwere these strange apparitions--forms which suggested somewhat the\r\noutlines of a ship, or boat; but then--who ever saw a ship, or a boat,\r\nfloating in mid-air? Someone whispered that they formed part of the\r\nentertainment; yet there was something too material, too realistic,\r\nabout them to warrant this belief. And were not those human forms\r\nmoving about in them?\r\n\r\nOutside the gates of Fairoaks, too, strange events were occurring. The\r\ntwo sentries at the gates, stationed there because of the presence of\r\ntheir Majesties, noticed a number of peculiarly constructed mobiles\r\nsuddenly make their appearance in the highway. These mobiles stopped\r\nbefore the grounds of Fairoaks and the foremost advanced as if to\r\nmake its way through the gates. There was something suspicious about\r\nthe general appearance and movements of these mobiles, and one of the\r\nsentries promptly challenged.\r\n\r\nHis answer was a sudden flash of rifle barrels, a point-blank volley\r\nand, shot through head and breast, the sentry dropped dead in his\r\ntracks. His companion, apparently unwounded, hastily dodged behind\r\nthe high stone wall and, with a ringing shout, gave the alarm to his\r\nfellow-guardsmen, comfortably encamped upon one of the wide-stretching\r\nlawns a short distance away.\r\n\r\nIn an instant, the guards were up and doing. Through the gateway they\r\nswarmed and into the roadway. They were met by rifle fire from the\r\nmobiles, which, however, immediately beat a hasty retreat. The guards,\r\nseveral of their number wounded, started in pursuit, led by Captains\r\nFarquharson and Bingham. The huge aërial shapes which had been hovering\r\nover the grounds, now made movement and rapidly changed their positions\r\nuntil they floated over the highway, immediately above the pursuing\r\nguards.\r\n\r\nNow followed a scene which was as novel in its form of attack as it\r\nwas effective and terrible. The air-ships--for it was now plainly to\r\nbe seen that air-ships they were--began raining down missiles, in the\r\nform of exploding bombs, upon the advancing soldiers. Some of these\r\nmissiles struck the men direct and killed them outright, while others\r\nfell upon the hard bed of the highway and exploded, carrying death and\r\ndestruction in wide circles.\r\n\r\nIn less than a minute the highway was filled with a long track of dead\r\nand wounded men, and still the deadly missiles continued to rain down.\r\nFurther pursuit of the mobiles was obviously impossible. Farquharson\r\nand Bingham halted their men. Several volleys were fired at the\r\nair-ships, but this fire was utterly ineffective. They were either\r\nbullet-proof or out of range.\r\n\r\nUnless the officers would see the extermination of the entire command\r\nthere in the highway, evidently the only thing to be done was to find\r\nshelter immediately for the men--the shelter of the mansion. Besides,\r\nin view of this attack, prudence suggested rallying the guards around\r\nthe person of the King.\r\n\r\nThe command was accordingly given to retreat, in extended order, upon\r\nthe house. This movement was only executed with further loss, as the\r\nair-ships continued to follow up and attack. In approaching and passing\r\nthrough the gateway leading into the grounds, the men were necessarily\r\nmore or less massed, and here the loss was heavy. Captains Farquharson\r\nand Bingham stationed themselves at the approaches to this gateway,\r\nawaiting the passage of the last man, in order that they themselves\r\nmight be the last to pass through. It was here that Captain Farquharson\r\nfell. His brother officer bent over him, in the endeavor to lend him\r\naid, but one glance was sufficient to show him that all hope here was\r\npast. Then, coolly as if on parade, he made his way through the grounds\r\nand was the last to enter the house.\r\n\r\nHis first act was to make provision for defense. He stationed his\r\nmen upon the broad main stairway and also in position to command the\r\nwindows at the ground and first stories upon all four sides of the\r\nhouse. To attempt to station any men upon the roof was obviously\r\nuseless, as they would be destroyed from above by the air-ships, which\r\nhad been the fate of the men in the highway. His wounded he disposed\r\nof as best he could, and the royal party and the guests he gathered\r\ntogether in one group in the big drawing-rooms on the second floor.\r\n\r\nHis next thought was of those outside who had been wounded, and he\r\norganized a small corps of men, under Lieutenant Richmond Dobson, to\r\ngo out under a flag of truce and bring them in. This corps started\r\nout, but returned in a very few minutes empty-handed. Lieutenant\r\nDobson reported that the air-ships had strictly respected the flag\r\nof truce, but at the gateway he had been met by a similar signal\r\nfrom the mobiles. The person in command of this party, who wore a\r\npeculiarly-shaped gold star upon his left shoulder, had informed\r\nLieutenant Dobson that he could not be permitted to proceed, but\r\nthat his wounded would be cared for. The attacking party, he was\r\ninformed, had ample surgical assistance with them for this purpose.\r\nThe Lieutenant had then been requested to return to the mansion and\r\nbear a message to the officer in command to the effect that unless an\r\nunconditional surrender was made within five minutes an attack upon the\r\nmansion itself would be begun.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” exclaimed Captain Bingham fiercely, “it looks as if they were\r\nwell-organized and well-prepared, but we are at least under some\r\nshelter here. Did you inquire in whose name this command was made?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“And what was the answer?”\r\n\r\n“That it was made in the name of the General commanding the First Army\r\nCorps of the New Republic.”\r\n\r\n“What! A general in command--the First Army Corps!” muttered Captain\r\nBingham. “That sounds like a comprehensive organization. It looks\r\nserious!”\r\n\r\nAt this moment a servant of the house approached with word that His\r\nMajesty wished to see Captain Bingham and hear his report.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bingham accordingly went upstairs and communicated to the King\r\nall he had learned.\r\n\r\n“Have you audiphoned to the palace for such soldiers as are there?”\r\ninquired His Majesty.\r\n\r\n“It would be absolutely useless to do so, Sire,” replied Captain\r\nBingham. “There is but a comparatively small force there, and should\r\nthey attempt to come to our relief they would be exterminated to a man\r\nbefore they reached us. Nearly half of my command was either killed or\r\nwounded in traversing the short distance from the roadway to the house.\r\nWhat would it be with any force from the palace attempting to approach\r\nover several miles of ground?”\r\n\r\n“True,” said the King. “Where can assistance, then, be obtained?”\r\n\r\n“The nearest point from which effective aid can be sent,” replied\r\nCaptain Bingham, “is from the city, and I have already audiphoned to\r\nthe army headquarters there. I have explained the attack, and stated\r\nthat we are besieged and have requested the immediate dispatch of a\r\nlarge force, which has been promised me. I did this, as it seemed to me\r\nto be the only thing to do, although I frankly confess that I do not\r\nsee how even a large force can prevail against an enemy they cannot\r\nreach. Possibly, however, they may be able to beat off the air-ships\r\nwith heavy guns, though I am not sanguine of success.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said the King, “it will be some time before assistance can reach\r\nus from the city.”\r\n\r\n“Allowing for everything,” replied Captain Bingham, “about three hours.\r\nI have furthermore counseled, as a measure of precaution, that no\r\nattempt be made to approach here until after nightfall. With the aid of\r\ndarkness and a large force, we might at least hope to get you, Sire,\r\nand your suite safely away.”\r\n\r\n“What is it they desire--what is it they ask?” questioned the King.\r\n\r\n“I know no more, Sire, than I have already reported to you.”\r\n\r\nThe King reflected a moment.\r\n\r\n“Send out to them and inquire,” he commanded.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Dobson was sent forth once more, accompanied by a private\r\nbearing a flag of truce. He returned in even less time than before. The\r\nanswer he bore was that no further information would be furnished; no\r\nfurther delay granted. Unless the King and everyone within the mansion\r\nmade unconditional surrender within three minutes after the return of\r\nthe flag of truce, an attack would be begun forthwith.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bingham reported at once to His Majesty.\r\n\r\n“Ah, they appear, then, to know positively that We are here!” said the\r\nKing.\r\n\r\n“Evidently, Sire,” replied Captain Bingham.\r\n\r\n“What remains, then to be done?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, Sire,” answered Captain Bingham, with grim determination,\r\n“except for the Guards to defend this house and those within it while\r\none stone stands upon another and while there is one man left upon his\r\nfeet!”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke there was a sound of rending, of tearing and of disrupted\r\nmasonry on the eastern side of the mansion.\r\n\r\n“The attack has begun, Sire!” said Captain Bingham. “I would ask\r\nyour permission to return to my men.” And with a bow as courtly and\r\nas deferential as if he were standing in the great ball-room of the\r\npalace, Captain Richard Bingham backed from the royal presence and\r\nreturned to his men.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he reached his post at the head of the main stairway,\r\nCaptain Bingham quickly perceived that the attack had been renewed by\r\nthe air-ships and that it was directed by hurling explosives against\r\nthe eastern wall of the building. So powerful were these explosives\r\nthat a great gaping aperture soon appeared, stretching from window to\r\nwindow, wide and deep enough to have admitted a motor of the largest\r\ntype. The attack was then shifted to the front of the house and the\r\nfront wall blown open in a similar manner. Then, with a crash, the\r\nwhole of the great front door was blown in.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers on the ground floor and upon the main stairway were\r\nnow exposed to a raking fire from two sides and the air-ships were\r\nnot slow to follow up their advantage. They hurled their explosive\r\nmissiles into the men massed upon the stairway and with rifle fire\r\npicked off individual soldiers at windows and upon the lower floor. The\r\nsoldiers returned the fire with spirit, sending volley after volley\r\nat the air-ships as they appeared through the great, yawning gaps in\r\nthe walls. This fire seemed, however, utterly ineffectual against the\r\nstrong sides of the air-ships and the protecting shields thrown up\r\naround them. Comrades were falling fast on every side; the air was\r\nfilled with the groans and the cries of the wounded and the dying; the\r\nmen were growing disheartened. Then the voice of Captain Bingham rang\r\nout above the tumult:\r\n\r\n“Guards, stand fast and die like men!”\r\n\r\nA hoarse cheer, despairing yet valiant--the final testimony to the\r\nnative valor of the American soldier--came from the men in response to\r\ntheir leader’s words. Yes, they would die like men! And carbines were\r\nreplenished with fresh determination, and fresh volleys were poured in\r\nupon the enemy.\r\n\r\nBut it was all of no avail. Their efforts, directed against an enemy\r\nthey could not reach, were futile. Down went Lieutenant Dobson, the\r\nlast of the sub-alterns yet unscathed, and still the missiles continued\r\nto rain upon the devoted and rapidly diminishing band.\r\n\r\nThe terrible devastation going on was not unknown to those gathered in\r\nthe shelter of the drawing-rooms, and the same servant who had come to\r\nhim before, now crept forth to Captain Bingham’s side. In his hand he\r\ncarried a large pocket-handkerchief of white silk, attached to the end\r\nof a stick. This he extended to Captain Bingham.\r\n\r\n“His Majesty directs you to surrender,” he stammered, his teeth\r\nchattering with the horror of the sights about him.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bingham turned upon him with the blazing eyes of a madman. “You\r\nlie, you scoundrel!” he shouted. “You have misunderstood His Majesty’s\r\norders!” And with the flat of his sword he struck the emblem of\r\nsurrender from the man’s hand, and with the point of his sword at the\r\nman’s throat he drove him back to the shelter of the drawing-rooms.\r\n\r\nAnd now the stairway, broken and demolished in many places, was\r\nslippery with blood and choked with the bodies of the fallen. The rain\r\nof missiles had ceased and had been succeeded by a sharp rifle fire\r\nwhich rapidly picked off the few remaining survivors. Down went the\r\ncolor sergeant at Captain Bingham’s side. The Captain stood at the head\r\nof the stairway, still guarding the approach to the drawing-rooms. He\r\nhad been struck on the left side of the head by a flying fragment of\r\nsome kind, and from the wound the blood trickled down his pale face and\r\nover his uniform. He was the last man left.\r\n\r\nThe rifle fire from the air-ships closed entirely, and through the\r\ndemolished front there surged a mass of men--men from the mobiles. They\r\nwere armed with rifles and upon their left shoulders they bore a white\r\nstar. A golden star of peculiar formation glittered upon the shoulder\r\nof their leader, and he carried a sword.\r\n\r\n“Surrender!” shouted this leader, advancing up the stairway, sword in\r\nhand, followed by his men.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bingham, standing grim and bloody at the head of the stairs,\r\nmade no reply.\r\n\r\n“Surrender!” repeated the leader. “Do you not see that your men are all\r\ndead and that you are ours?”\r\n\r\n“Curse you,” came the reply from the guardsman, “as they went, so will\r\nI go. You shall never pass while I live.” And with upraised sword he\r\nstood blocking the way to the drawing-rooms.\r\n\r\nThe leader now crossed swords with Captain Bingham, while two of his\r\nmen sought to creep by to right and left and either attack, or capture,\r\nthe Captain from the side. But the officers of the guards were all\r\nbrilliant swordsmen, and Captain Bingham in that last desperate stand\r\nfully vindicated the honor and the reputation of the famous Guards’\r\ncorps. Besides, being at the extreme top of the stairway, he held an\r\nadvantage which served to offset the odds against him. First he wounded\r\nthe man to the right and an instant later cut down the man on the left.\r\nThen, with a quick half-arm cut which laid his opponent’s face open\r\nfrom forehead to chin, he sent the leader reeling backward down the\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\nWhen his men saw their leader fall, a howl of dismay and rage went up.\r\nThere was a quick flash of leveled rifles and a volley. Captain Bingham\r\nrose to his full height and for one brief instant his form stood erect\r\nand rigid. He raised his sword high aloft and his voice broke into a\r\ngreat hoarse cry--the last salute of the last of the Guards to the\r\ncause he served:\r\n\r\n“Long live the King!”\r\n\r\nThen his sword-arm dropped, the weapon fell clattering from his hand\r\nand, with a headlong plunge, he crashed down the stairs over the dead\r\nbodies of his men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE NEW ERA\r\n\r\n\r\n“The King! The Guards! They have been attacked!” cried Kearns as,\r\nbreathless and panting, he ran into the Chancellerie.\r\n\r\n“Attacked!” repeated Mortimer, standing sword in hand, stern-faced and\r\nbleeding from a wound in the arm. “Attacked by whom?”\r\n\r\n“The air-ships--the air-ships!” gasped Kearns. “But,” he exclaimed,\r\npointing to the form upon the ground; “what--what is this?”\r\n\r\n“One who has met a rightful doom!” answered Mortimer. “But the\r\nattack--tell me of the attack.”\r\n\r\n“I was on my way to the King,” said Kearns, in rapid tones, “and was\r\napproaching Fairoaks when I perceived the air-ships and ordered the\r\nphaeromobile halted. I watched and saw it all.”\r\n\r\n“Saw all what?”\r\n\r\n“They had driven the King--the guests--the Guards--all of them into the\r\nmansion,” continued Kearns, with the same rapid enunciation, “and the\r\nair-ships attacked them there. My God! they blew great holes into the\r\nside and front of the house, and through these holes they made attack\r\nupon the Guards. Then I saw the men in the motors come up and charge\r\ninto the mansion and I knew that all was over. Then, back I came here\r\nto you at full speed, but as I reached the palace I looked behind and\r\nsaw that I was being pursued both on land and from above. I tell you\r\nthey are hot upon us--in a few minutes they will be here!”\r\n\r\nThe portieres parted as he spoke and Beatrice ran, eager and excited,\r\ninto the room.\r\n\r\n“We are attacked! A swarm of men are pouring into the palace and the\r\ngrounds. Where is Dorothy? Oh!--oh!--what is this!” and she ran to the\r\nfigure lying upon the divan.\r\n\r\n“I must go to my post,” cried Mortimer, casting a desperate glance\r\ntoward the divan. “I must rally the men to the defense of the palace!”\r\n\r\n“Too late!” exclaimed Kearns, turning sharply.\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, there were sounds without and through the portieres and\r\nthe main door of the Chancellerie a number of armed men, with stars at\r\ntheir shoulders, swarmed in, an officer at their head.\r\n\r\n“Surrender!” cried the officer, as his eyes fell upon Mortimer’s\r\nuniform.\r\n\r\n“Surrender!” repeated Mortimer, with rage. “How dare you utter that\r\nword in the King’s palace to an officer of the King’s Guard? Back, you\r\nhorde of rebels, I say, or I will cut a path through you!”\r\n\r\nFrom behind him there came an exclamation of fear, a plaintive appeal\r\nto him to stop, but he heard it not and, with upraised sword, he\r\nadvanced upon the men barring his passage. The officer raised his sword\r\nin an attitude of defense and a dozen rifles instantly flashed into\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n“Halt! Do not fire!” came suddenly the sharp command from the rear\r\nand a tall and commanding figure forced its way through the ranks. An\r\ninstant later, Mortimer found himself confronted by General Mainwarren.\r\n\r\n“Do not fire!” repeated General Mainwarren to his men. “I place this\r\nofficer and all these here under my special protection.”\r\n\r\n“But I cannot--I will not--avail myself of your protection!” cried\r\nMortimer, still standing with upraised sword. “I will force my way\r\nthrough to my men, or fall in the attempt!”\r\n\r\n“There will be no necessity for that,” said General Mainwarren, gently.\r\n“Your passage shall not be barred and you shall be free to go where\r\nyou will. But,” he added, calmly, “it will be useless to seek your\r\nsoldiers, for they are all dead.”\r\n\r\n“Dead!” repeated Mortimer aghast.\r\n\r\nFrom the grounds without came a great cry:\r\n\r\n“Long live the New Republic!”\r\n\r\nBefore General Mainwarren could make answer to Mortimer’s exclamation,\r\na file of men, with an officer in command, invaded the room.\r\n\r\n“A wounded guardsman, sir, and his companion,” reported the officer,\r\nsaluting General Mainwarren. “What shall be done with them?” and he\r\nbrought forward Captain Swords and Professor Dean.\r\n\r\n“Oh, cousin, cousin!” cried Beatrice, running up to General Mainwarren,\r\nall excitement, “I demand protection--special protection for him!” and\r\nshe pointed to Captain Swords.\r\n\r\n“It is granted!” said General Mainwarren, with a smile. “His companion,\r\nlikewise, shall be protected. We all of us owe something,” he added,\r\nturning to his men, “to Professor Dean and to Captain Mortimer.”\r\n\r\n“Long live the New Republic!” again came the cry from the grounds.\r\n\r\n“How so? What do you owe us?” exclaimed Mortimer in astonishment.\r\n\r\n“To Professor Dean,” said General Mainwarren, gravely, “we owe the\r\nprimary invention of the air-ship from which we derive our strength;\r\nand to Captain Mortimer, because to his unexpected escape from us, the\r\nNew Republic owes its birth three days earlier than was anticipated.\r\nYes, Captain Mortimer, your escape precipitated our attack just three\r\ndays.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” exclaimed Mortimer, blankly.\r\n\r\n“I think you are needed over there,” said Beatrice, touching him\r\nlightly upon the arm, and turning her eyes toward the divan. “As for\r\nme, I must give my attention to the wounded. How sweet and cute he\r\nlooks with the bandage tilted down toward his left eye!” And she walked\r\nto where stood Captain Swords and rested both hands upon his arm.\r\n\r\nMortimer crossed to the divan where Dorothy lay. He bent over her\r\nuntil their lips nearly met and whispered so low that none other\r\nheard--something which brought the color in a warm tide to her pale\r\nface.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” continued General Mainwarren, with fervor, “we owe, as I have\r\nsaid, something to both of these men. To-day the New Republic has\r\nbirth--a New Republic which shall give men that equality which can\r\nnever be found under a monarchy and which shall be untainted, please\r\nGod, from the hideous evils which fastened themselves upon the Old\r\nRepublic of our forefathers--a New Republic which shall free its\r\ncitizens from the bondage of industrial slavery and shall set to the\r\nworld at large an example of higher economic conditions and a higher\r\nstandard of human happiness. Let us joyously greet, then, this glorious\r\nevent!”\r\n\r\n“Three cheers for the New Republic!” rang forth from the men gathered\r\nabout their General.\r\n\r\nFrom the grounds without came the answering cry:\r\n\r\n“Long live the New Republic! Long live the New Republic!”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER’S NOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Italicized text is surrounded by underscores: _italics_.\r\n\r\n  Obvious typographical errors have been corrected.\r\n\r\n  Inconsistencies in hyphenation have been standardized.\r\n\r\n  Archaic or variant spelling has been retained.\r\n\r\n  The Table of Contents for this eBook was created by the transcriber\r\n    for the reader's convenience and is granted to the public domain.",
