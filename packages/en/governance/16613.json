FORMER SOCIALIST PREMIER OF FINLAND ON BOLSHEVISM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following pages I have tried to make a plain and easily\r\nunderstandable outline of the origin, history, and meaning of Bolshevism. I\r\nhave attempted to provide the average American reader with a fair and\r\nreliable statement of the philosophy, program, and policies of the Russian\r\nBolsheviki. In order to avoid confusion, and to keep the matter as simple\r\nand clear as possible, I have not tried to deal with the numerous\r\nmanifestations of Bolshevism in other lands, but have confined myself\r\nstrictly to the Russian example. With some detail--too much, some of my\r\nreaders may think!--I have sketched the historical background in order that\r\nthe Bolsheviki may be seen in proper perspective and fairly judged in\r\nconnection with the whole revolutionary movement in Russia.\r\n\r\nWhoever turns to these pages in the expectation of finding a sensational\r\n\"exposure\" of Bolshevism and the Bolsheviki will be disappointed. It has\r\nbeen my aim to make a deliberate and scientific study, not an _ex-parte_\r\nindictment. A great many lurid and sensational stories about the Bolsheviki\r\nhave been published, the net result of which is to make the leaders of this\r\nphase of the great universal war of the classes appear as brutal and\r\ndepraved monsters of iniquity. There is not a crime known to mankind,\r\napparently, of which they have not been loudly declared to be guilty. My\r\nlong experience in the Socialist movement has furnished me with too much\r\nunderstanding of the manner and extent to which working-class movements are\r\nabused and slandered to permit me to accept these stories as gospel truth.\r\nThat experience has forced me to assume that most of the terrible stories\r\ntold about the Bolsheviki are either untrue and without any foundation in\r\nfact or greatly exaggerated. The \"rumor factories\" in Geneva, Stockholm,\r\nCopenhagen, The Hague, and other European capitals, which were so busy\r\nduring the war fabricating and exploiting for profit stories of massacres,\r\nvictories, assassinations, revolutions, peace treaties, and other momentous\r\nevents, which subsequent information proved never to have happened at all,\r\nseem now to have turned their attention to the Bolsheviki.\r\n\r\nHowever little of a cynic one may be, it is almost impossible to refrain\r\nfrom wondering at the fact that so many writers and journals that in the\r\nquite recent past maintained absolute silence when the czar and his minions\r\nwere committing their infamous outrages against the working-people and\r\ntheir leaders, and that were never known to protest against the many crimes\r\ncommitted by our own industrial czars against our working-people and their\r\nleaders--that these writers and journals are now so violently denouncing\r\nthe Bolsheviki for alleged inhumanities. When the same journals that\r\ndefended or apologized for the brutal lynchings of I.W.W. agitators and the\r\nsavage assaults committed upon other peaceful citizens whose only crime was\r\nexercising their lawful and moral right to organize and strike for better\r\nwages, denounce the Bolsheviki for their \"brutality\" and their\r\n\"lawlessness\" and cry for vengeance upon them, honest and sincere men\r\nbecome bitter and scornful.\r\n\r\nI am not a Bolshevik or a defender of the Bolsheviki. As a Social Democrat\r\nand Internationalist of many years' standing--and therefore loyal to\r\nAmerica and American ideals--I am absolutely opposed to the principles and\r\npractices of the Bolsheviki, which, from the very first, I have regarded\r\nand denounced as an inverted form of Czarism. It is quite clear to my mind,\r\nhowever, that there can be no good result from wild abuse or from\r\nmisrepresentation of facts and motives. I am convinced that the stupid\r\ncampaign of calumny which has been waged against the Bolsheviki has won for\r\nthem the sympathy of many intelligent Americans who love fairness and hate\r\ninjustice. In this way lying and abuse react against those who indulge in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn this study I have completely ignored the flood of newspaper stories of\r\nBolshevist \"outrages\" and \"crimes\" which has poured forth during the past\r\nyear. I have ignored, too, the remarkable collection of documents edited\r\nand annotated by Mr. Sisson and published by the United States Committee on\r\nPublic Information. I do not doubt that there is much that is true in that\r\ncollection of documents--indeed, there is some corroboration of some of\r\nthem--but the means of determining what is true and what false are not yet\r\navailable to the student. So much doubt and suspicion is reasonably and\r\nproperly attached to some of the documents that the value of the whole mass\r\nis greatly impaired. To rely upon these documents to make a case against\r\nthe Bolsheviki, unless and until they have been more fully investigated and\r\nauthenticated than they appear to have been as yet, and corroborated, would\r\nbe like relying upon the testimony of an unreliable witness to convict a\r\nman serious crime.\r\n\r\nThat the Bolsheviki have been guilty of many crimes is certain. Ample\r\nevidence of that fact will be found in the following pages. They have\r\ncommitted many crimes against men and women whose splendid service to the\r\nRussian revolutionary movement serves only to accentuate the crimes in\r\nquestion. But their worst crimes have been against political and social\r\ndemocracy, which they have shamefully betrayed and opposed with as little\r\nscruple, and as much brutal injustice, as was ever manifested by the\r\nRomanovs. This is a terrible charge, I know, but I believe that the most\r\nsympathetic toward the Bolsheviki among my readers will, if they are\r\ncandid, admit that it is amply sustained by the evidence.\r\n\r\nConcerning that evidence it is perhaps necessary to say that I have\r\nconfined myself to the following: official documents issued by the\r\nBolshevist government; the writings and addresses of accredited Bolshevik\r\nleaders and officials--in the form in which they have been published by the\r\nBolsheviki themselves; the declarations of Russian Socialist organizations\r\nof long and honorable standing in the international Socialist movement; the\r\nstatements of equally well-known and trusted Russian Socialists, and of\r\nresponsible Russian Socialist journals.\r\n\r\nWhile I have indicated the sources of most of the evidence against the\r\nBolsheviki, either in the text itself or in the foot-notes and references,\r\nI have not thought it advisable to burden my pages with such foot-notes and\r\nreferences concerning matters of general knowledge. To have given\r\nreferences and authorities for all the facts summarized in the historical\r\noutlines, for example, would have been simply a show of pedantry and served\r\nonly to frighten away the ordinary reader.\r\n\r\nI have been deeply indebted to the works of other writers, among which I\r\nmay mention the following: Peter Kropotkin's _Memoirs of a Revolutionist_\r\nand _Ideals and Realities of Russian Literature_; S. Stepniak's\r\n_Underground Russia_; Leo Deutsch's _Sixteen Years in Siberia_; Alexander\r\nUlar's _Russia from Within_; William English Walling's _Russia's Message_;\r\nZinovy N. Preev's _The Russian Riddle_; Maxim Litvinov's _The Bolshevik\r\nRevolution: Its Rise and Meaning_; M.J. Olgin's _The Soul of the Russian\r\nRevolution_; A.J. Sack's _The Birth of Russian Democracy_; E.A. Ross's\r\n_Russia in Upheaval_; Isaac Don Levine's _The Russian Revolution_; Bessie\r\nBeatty's _The Red Heart of Russia_; Louise Bryant's _Six Red Months in\r\nRussia_; Leon Trotzky's _Our Revolution_ and _The Bolsheviki and World\r\nPeace_; Gabriel Domergue's _La Russe Rouge_; Nikolai Lenine's _The Soviets\r\nat Work_; Zinoviev and Lenine's _Sozialismus und Krieg_; Emile\r\nVandervelde's _Trois Aspects de la Révolution Russe_; P.G. Chesnais's _La\r\nRévolution et la Paix_ and _Les Bolsheviks_. I have also freely availed\r\nmyself of the many admirable translations of official Bolshevist documents\r\npublished in _The Class Struggle_, of New York, a pro-Bolshevist magazine;\r\nthe collection of documents published by _The Nation_, of New York, a\r\njournal exceedingly generous in its treatment of Bolshevism and the\r\nBolsheviki; and of the mass of material published in its excellent\r\n\"International Notes\" by _Justice_, of London, the oldest Socialist\r\nnewspaper in the English language, I believe, and one of the most ably\r\nedited.\r\n\r\nGrateful acknowledgment is hereby made of friendly service rendered and\r\nvaluable information given by Mr. Alexander Kerensky, former Premier of\r\nRussia; Mr. Henry L. Slobodin, of New York; Mr. A.J. Sack, Director of the\r\nRussian Information Bureau in the United States; Dr. Boris Takavenko,\r\neditor of _La Russia Nuova_, Rome, Italy; Mr. William English Walling, New\r\nYork; and my friend, Father Cahill, of Bennington.\r\n\r\nAmong the Appendices at the end of the volume will be found some important\r\ndocuments containing some contemporary Russian Socialist judgments of\r\nBolshevism. These documents are, I venture to suggest, of the utmost\r\npossible value and importance to the student and general reader.\r\n\r\n    JOHN SPARGO,\r\n\r\n    \"NESTLEDOWN,\"\r\n      OLD BENNNIGTON, VERMONT,\r\n        _End of January, 1919_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLSHEVISM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nFor almost a full century Russia has been the theater of a great\r\nrevolutionary movement. In the light of Russian history we read with\r\ncynical amusement that in 1848, when all Europe was in a revolutionary\r\nferment, a German economist confidently predicted that revolutionary\r\nagitation could not live in the peculiar soil of Russian civilization.\r\nAugust Franz von Haxthausen was in many respects a competent and even a\r\nprofound student of Russian politics, but he was wrong in his belief that\r\nthe amount of rural communism existing in Russia, particularly the _mir_,\r\nwould make it impossible for storms of revolutionary agitation to arise and\r\nstir the national life.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of historical fact, the ferment of revolution had appeared in\r\nthe land of the Czars long before the German economist made his remarkably\r\nill-judged forecast. At the end of the Napoleonic wars many young officers\r\nof the Russian army returned to their native land full of revolutionary\r\nideas and ideals acquired in France, Italy, and Germany, and intent upon\r\naction. At first their intention was simply to make an appeal to Alexander\r\nI to grant self-government to Russia, which at one time he had seemed\r\ndisposed to do. Soon they found themselves engaged in a secret conspiratory\r\nmovement having for its object the overthrow of Czarism. The story of the\r\nfailure of these romanticists, the manner in which the abortive attempt at\r\nrevolution in December, 1825, was suppressed, and how the leaders were\r\npunished by Nicholas I--these things are well known to most students of\r\nRussian history. The Decembrists, as they came to be called, failed, as\r\nthey were bound to do, but it would be a mistake to suppose that their\r\nefforts were altogether vain. On the contrary, their inspiration was felt\r\nthroughout the next thirty years and was reflected in the literature of the\r\nperiod. During that period Russian literature was tinged with the faith in\r\nsocial regeneration held by most of the cultured intellectual classes. The\r\nDecembrists were the spiritual progenitors of the Russian revolutionary\r\nmovement of our time. In the writings of Pushkin--himself a\r\nDecembrist--Lermontoff, Gogol, Turgeniev, Dostoyevsky, and many others less\r\nwell known, the influence of the Decembrist movement is clearly manifested.\r\n\r\nIf we are to select a single figure as the founder of the modern social\r\nrevolutionary movement in Russia, that title can be applied to Alexander\r\nHerzen with greater fitness than to any other. His influence upon the\r\nmovement during many years was enormous. Herzen was half-German, his mother\r\nbeing German. He was born at Moscow in 1812, shortly before the French\r\noccupation of the city. His parents were very rich and he enjoyed the\r\nadvantages of a splendid education, as well as great luxury. At twenty-two\r\nyears of age he was banished to a small town in the Urals, where he spent\r\nsix years, returning to Moscow in 1840. It is noteworthy that the offense\r\nfor which he had been sent into exile was the singing of songs in praise of\r\nthe Decembrist martyrs. This occurred at a meeting of one of the \"Students'\r\nCircles\" founded by Herzen for the dissemination of revolutionary Socialist\r\nideals among the students.\r\n\r\nUpon his return to Moscow in 1840 Herzen, together with Bakunin and other\r\nfriends, again engaged in revolutionary propaganda and in 1842 he was again\r\nexiled. In 1847, through the influence of powerful friends, he received\r\npermission to leave Russia for travel abroad. He never again saw his native\r\nland, all the remaining years of life being spent in exile. After a tour of\r\nItaly, Herzen arrived in Paris on the eve of the Revolution of 1848,\r\njoining there his friends, Bakunin and Turgeniev, and many other\r\nrevolutionary leaders. It was impossible for him to participate actively in\r\nthe 1848 uprising, owing to the activity of the Paris police, but he\r\nwatched the Revolution with the profoundest sympathy. And when it failed\r\nand was followed by the terrible reaction his distress was almost\r\nunbounded. For a brief period he was the victim of the most appalling\r\npessimism, but after a time his faith returned and he joined with Proudhon\r\nin issuing a radical revolutionary paper, _L'Ami du Peuple_, of which,\r\nKropotkin tells us in his admirable study of Russian literature, \"almost\r\nevery number was confiscated by the police of Napoleon the Third.\" The\r\npaper had a very brief life, and Herzen himself was soon expelled from\r\nFrance, going to Switzerland, of which country he became a citizen.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 Herzen settled in London, where he published for some years a\r\nremarkable paper, called _Kolokol (The Bell)_, in which he exposed the\r\niniquities and shortcomings of Czarism and inspired the youth of Russia\r\nwith his revolutionary ideals. The paper had to be smuggled into Russia, of\r\ncourse, and the manner in which the smuggling was done is one of the most\r\nabsorbing stories in all the tragic history of the vast land of the Czars.\r\nHerzen was a charming writer and a keen thinker, and it is impossible to\r\nexaggerate the extent of his influence. But when the freedom of the serfs,\r\nfor which he so vigorously contended, was promulgated by Alexander II, and\r\nother extensive reforms were granted, his influence waned. He died in 1870\r\nin Switzerland.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAlexander II was not alone in hoping that the Act of Liberation would usher\r\nin a new era of prosperity and tranquillity for Russia. Many of the most\r\nradical of the Intelligentsia, followers of Herzen, believed that Russia\r\nwas destined to outstrip the older nations of western Europe in its\r\ndemocracy and its culture. It was not long before disillusionment came: the\r\nserfs were set free, but the manner in which the land question had been\r\ndealt with made their freedom almost a mockery. As a result there were\r\nnumerous uprisings of peasants--riots which the government suppressed in\r\nthe most sanguinary manner. From that time until the present the land\r\nquestion has been the core of the Russian problem. Every revolutionary\r\nmovement has been essentially concerned with giving the land to the\r\npeasants.\r\n\r\nWithin a few months after the liberation of the serfs the revolutionary\r\nunrest was so wide-spread that the government became alarmed and instituted\r\na policy of vigorous repression. Progressive papers, which had sprung up as\r\na result of the liberal tendencies characterizing the reign of Alexander\r\nII thus far, were suppressed and many of the leading writers were\r\nimprisoned and exiled. Among those thus punished was that brilliant writer,\r\nTchernyshevsky, to whom the Russian movement owes so much. His\r\n_Contemporary Review_ was, during the four critical years 1858-62 the\r\nprincipal forum for the discussion of the problems most vital to the life\r\nof Russia. In it the greatest leaders of Russian thought discussed the land\r\nquestion, co-operation, communism, popular education, and similar subjects.\r\nThis served a twofold purpose: in the first place, it brought to the study\r\nof the pressing problems of the time the ablest and best minds of the\r\ncountry; secondly, it provided these Intellectuals with a bond of union and\r\nstimulus to serve the poor and the oppressed. That Alexander II had been\r\ninfluenced to sign the Emancipation Act by Tchernyshevsky and his friends\r\ndid not cause the authorities to spare Tchernyshevsky when, in 1863, he\r\nengaged in active Socialist propaganda. He was arrested and imprisoned in a\r\nfortress, where he wrote the novel which has so profoundly influenced two\r\ngenerations of discontented and protesting Russians--_What is to Be Done?_\r\nIn form a novel of thrilling interest, this work was really an elaborate\r\ntreatise upon Russian social conditions. It dealt with the vexed problems\r\nof marriage and divorce, the land question, co-operative production, and\r\nother similar matters, and the solutions it suggested for these problems\r\nbecame widely accepted as the program of revolutionary Russia. Few books in\r\nany literature have ever produced such a profound impression, or exerted as\r\nmuch influence upon the life of a nation. In the following year, 1864,\r\nTchernyshevsky was exiled to hard labor in Siberia, remaining there until\r\n1883, when he returned to Russia. He lived only six years longer, dying in\r\n1889.\r\n\r\nThe attempt made by a young student to assassinate Alexander II, on April\r\n4, 1866, was seized upon by the Czar and his advisers as an excuse for\r\ninstituting a policy of terrible reaction. The most repressive measures\r\nwere taken against the Intelligentsia and all the liberal reforms which had\r\nbeen introduced were practically destroyed. It was impossible to restore\r\nserfdom, of course, but the condition of the peasants without land was even\r\nworse than if they had remained serfs. Excessive taxation, heavy redemption\r\ncharges, famine, crop failures, and other ills drove the people to\r\ndesperation. Large numbers of students espoused the cause of the peasants\r\nand a new popular literature appeared in which the sufferings of the people\r\nwere portrayed with fervor and passion. In 1868-69 there were numerous\r\ndemonstrations and riots by way of protest against the reactionary policy\r\nof the government.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that Michael Bakunin, from his exile in Switzerland,\r\nconspired with Nechaiev to bring about a great uprising of the peasants,\r\nthrough the Society for the Liberation of the People. Bakunin advised the\r\nstudents to leave the universities and to go among the people to teach them\r\nand, at the same time, arouse them to revolt. It was at this time, too,\r\nthat Nicholas Tchaykovsky and his friends, the famous Circle of\r\nTchaykovsky, began to distribute among students in all parts of the Empire\r\nbooks dealing with the condition of the peasants and proposing remedies\r\ntherefor. This work greatly influenced the young Intelligentsia, but the\r\nimmediate results among the peasants were not very encouraging. Even the\r\nreturn from Switzerland, by order of the government, of hundreds of\r\nstudents who were disciples of Bakunin and Peter Lavrov did not produce any\r\ngreat success.\r\n\r\nVery soon a new organization appeared. The remnant of the Circle\r\nTchaykovsky, together with some followers of Bakunin, formed a society\r\ncalled the Land and Freedom Society. This society, which was destined to\r\nexert a marked influence upon revolutionary Russia, was the most ambitious\r\nrevolutionary effort Russia had known. The society had a constitution and a\r\ncarefully worked out program. It had one special group to carry on\r\npropaganda among students; another to agitate among the peasants; and a\r\nthird to employ armed force against the government and against those guilty\r\nof treachery toward the society. The basis of the society was the\r\nconviction that Russia needed an economic revolution; that only an economic\r\nrevolution, starting with the producers, could overthrow Czarism and\r\nestablish the ideal state of society.\r\n\r\nThe members of this Land and Freedom Society divided their work into four\r\nmain divisions: (1) Agitation--passive and active. Passive agitation\r\nincluded strikes, petitions for reforms, refusal to pay taxes, and so on.\r\nActive agitation meant riots and uprisings. (2) Organization--the formation\r\nof a fighting force prepared to bring about a general uprising. (3)\r\nEducation--the spreading of revolutionary knowledge and ideas, a\r\ncontinuation of the work of the Tchaykovsky Circle. (4) Secularization--the\r\ncarrying on of systematic work against the Orthodox Church through special\r\nchannels. One of the early leaders of this society was George Plechanov,\r\nwho later founded the Russian Social Democracy and gave to the Russian\r\nrevolutionary movement its Marxian character, inspiring such men as Nikolai\r\nLenine and Leon Trotzky, among many others. The society did not attain any\r\nvery great amount of success in its efforts to reach the peasants, and it\r\nwas that fact more than any other which determined Plechanov's future\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWhen the failure of the Land and Freedom methods became evident, and the\r\ngovernment became more and more oppressive, desperate individuals and\r\ngroups resorted to acts of terrorism. It was thus that Vera Zasulich\r\nattempted the assassination of the infamous Chief of Police Trepov. The\r\nmovement to temper Czarism by assassination systematically pursued was\r\nbeginning. In 1879 the Land and Freedom Society held a conference for the\r\npurpose of discussing its program. A majority favored resorting to\r\nterroristic tactics; Plechanov and a few other well-known revolutionists\r\nwere opposed--favoring the old methods. The society split, the majority\r\nbecoming known as the Will of the People and adopting a terroristic\r\nprogram. This organization sentenced Czar Alexander II to death and several\r\nunsuccessful attempts were made to carry out the sentence. The leaders\r\nbelieved that the assassination of the Czar would give rise to a general\r\nrevolution throughout the whole of Russia. In February, 1880, occurred the\r\nfamous attempt to blow up the Winter Palace. For a time it seemed that the\r\nCzar had learned the lesson the Will of the People sought to teach him, and\r\nthat he would institute far-reaching reforms. Pursuing a policy of\r\nvacillation and fear, however, Alexander II soon fell back into the old\r\nattitude. On March 1, 1881, a group of revolutionists, among them Sophia\r\nPerovskaya, made another attempt upon his life, succeeding, at first, only\r\nin damaging the bottom of the Czar's carriage and wounding a number of\r\nCossack soldiers. \"Thank God, I am untouched,\" said the Czar, in response\r\nto the inquiry of an officer of his guard. \"It's too soon to thank God!\"\r\ncried N.I. Grinevitsky, hurling a bomb at the Czar. Within a short time\r\nAlexander II and his assailant were both dead.\r\n\r\nThe assassination of Alexander II was a tragic event for Russia. On the\r\nvery morning of his death the ill-fated monarch had approved a plan for\r\nextensive reforms presented by the liberal Minister, Loris-Melikoff. It had\r\nbeen decided to call a conference three days later and to invite a number\r\nof well-known public men to co-operate in introducing the reforms. These\r\nreforms would not have been far-reaching enough to satisfy the\r\nrevolutionists, but they would certainly have improved the situation and\r\ngiven Russia a new hope. That hope died with Alexander II. His son,\r\nAlexander III, had always been a pronounced reactionary and had advised his\r\nfather against making any concessions to the agitators. It was not\r\nsurprising, therefore, that he permitted himself to be advised against the\r\nliberals by the most reactionary bureaucrats in the Empire, and to adopt\r\nthe most oppressive policies.\r\n\r\nThe new Czar was greatly influenced by his former tutor, the reactionary\r\nbureaucrat Pobiedonostzev. At first it was believed that out of respect for\r\nhis father's memory Alexander III would carry out the program of reforms\r\nformulated by Loris-Melikoff, as his father had promised to do. In a\r\nManifesto issued on the 29th of April, 1881, Alexander III promised to do\r\nthis, but in the same document there were passages which could only be\r\ninterpreted as meaning that all demands for constitutional reform would be\r\nresisted and Absolutism upheld at all cost. Doubtless it was due to the\r\ninfluence of Pobiedonostzev, Procurator of the Holy Synod, that Alexander\r\nIII soon abandoned all intention of carrying out his father's wishes in the\r\nmatter of reform and instituted such reactionary policies that the peasants\r\nfeared that serfdom was to be restored. A terrible persecution of the Jews\r\nwas begun, lasting for several years. The Poles, too, felt the oppressive\r\nhand of Pobiedonostzev. The latter was mastered by the Slavophil philosophy\r\nthat the revolutionary unrest in Russia was traceable to the diversity of\r\nraces, languages, and religions. He believed that Nihilism, Anarchism, and\r\nSocialism flourished because the people were cosmopolitan rather than\r\nnationalistic in experience and feeling, and that peace and stability could\r\ncome only from the persistent and vigorous development of the three\r\nprinciples of Nationality, Orthodoxy, and Autocracy as the basis of the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nIn this doctrine we have the whole explanation of the reactionary policy of\r\nAlexander III. In the Manifesto of April 29th was announced the Czar's\r\ndetermination to strengthen and uphold autocracy. That was the foundation\r\nstone. To uphold orthodoxy was the next logical necessity, for autocracy\r\nand orthodoxy were, in Russia, closely related. Hence the non-orthodox\r\nsects--such as the Finnish Protestants, German Lutherans, Polish Roman\r\nCatholics, the Jews, and the Mohammedans--were increasingly restricted in\r\nthe observance of their religion. They might not build new places of\r\nworship; their children could not be educated in the faith of their\r\nparents. In many cases children were taken away from their parents in order\r\nto be sent to schools where they would be inculcated with the orthodox\r\nfaith. In a similar way, every attempt was made to suppress the use of\r\nlanguages other than Russian.\r\n\r\nAlong with this attempt to force the whole population into a single mold\r\nwent a determined resistance to liberalism in all its forms. All this was\r\naccompanied by a degree of efficiency in the police service quite unusual\r\nin Russia, with the result that the terroristic tactics of the Will of the\r\nPeople party were unavailing, except in the cases of a few minor officials.\r\nPlots to assassinate the Czar were laid, but they were generally betrayed\r\nto the police. The most serious of these plots, in March, 1887, led to the\r\narrest of all the conspirators.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time there had appeared the first definite Marxian Social\r\nDemocratic group in Russia. Plechanov, Vera Zasulich, Leo Deutsch, and\r\nother Russian revolutionists in Switzerland formed the organization known\r\nas the Group for the Emancipation of Labor. This organization was based\r\nupon the principles and tactics of Marxian Socialism and sought to create a\r\npurely proletarian movement. As we have seen, when revolutionary terrorism\r\nwas at its height Plechanov and his disciples had proclaimed its futility\r\nand pinned their faith to the nascent class of industrial wage-workers. In\r\nthe early 'eighties this class was so small in Russia that it seemed to\r\nmany of the best and clearest minds of the revolutionary movement quite\r\nhopeless to rely upon it. Plechanov was derided as a mere theorist and\r\ncloset philosopher, but he never wavered in his conviction that Socialism\r\nmust come in Russia as the natural outcome of capitalist development. By\r\nmeans of a number of scholarly polemics against the principles and tactics\r\nof the Will of the People party, Plechanov gathered to his side of the\r\ncontroversy a group of very brilliant and able disciples, and so laid the\r\nbasis for the Social Democratic Labor party. With the relatively rapid\r\nexpansion of capitalism, beginning with the year 1888, and the inevitable\r\nincrease of the city proletariat, the Marxian movement made great progress.\r\nA strong labor-union movement and a strong political Socialist movement\r\nwere thus developed side by side.\r\n\r\nAt the same time there was a revival of terrorism, the one available reply\r\nof the oppressed to brutal autocracy. While the Marxian movement made\r\nheadway among the industrial workers, the older terroristic movement made\r\nheadway among the peasants. Various groups appeared in different parts of\r\nthe country. When Alexander III died, at the end of 1894, both movements\r\nhad developed considerable strength. Working in secret and subject to\r\nterrible measures of repression, their leaders being constantly imprisoned\r\nand exiled, these two wings of the Russian revolutionary movement were\r\ngathering strength in preparation for an uprising more extensive and\r\nserious than anything that had hitherto been attempted.\r\n\r\nWhenever a new Czar ascended the throne in Russia it was the fashion to\r\nhope for some measure of reform and for a degree of liberality. Frequently,\r\nas in the case of Alexander III, all such hopes were speedily killed, but\r\nrepeated experiences of the kind did not prevent the birth of new hopes\r\nwith the death of successive Czars. When, therefore, Alexander III was\r\nsucceeded by his son, Nicholas II, liberal Russia expectantly awaited the\r\npromulgation of constitutional reforms. In this they were doomed to\r\ndisappointment, just as they had been on the occasion of the accession of\r\nthe new Czar's immediate predecessor. Nicholas II was evidently going to be\r\nquite as reactionary as his father was. This was made manifest in a number\r\nof ways. When a deputation from one of the zemstvos, which congratulated\r\nhim upon his ascension to the throne, expressed the hope that he would\r\nlisten to \"the voice of the people and the expression of its desires,\" the\r\nreply of the new Czar was a grim warning of what was to come. Nicholas II\r\ntold the zemstvos that he intended to follow the example of his father and\r\nuphold the principles of Absolutism, and that any thought of participation\r\nby the zemstvos or other organizations of the people in state affairs was a\r\nsenseless dream. More significant still, perhaps, was the fact that the\r\nhated Pobiedonostzev was retained in power.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionists were roused as they had not been for a decade or more.\r\nSome of the leaders believed that the new reign of reaction would prove to\r\nbe the occasion and the opportunity for bringing about a union of all the\r\nrevolutionary forces, Anarchists and Socialists alike, peasants and\r\nindustrial workers. This hope was destined to fail, but there was an\r\nunmistakable revolutionary awakening. In the latter part of January, 1895,\r\nan open letter to Nicholas II was smuggled into the country from\r\nSwitzerland and widely distributed. It informed the Czar that the\r\nSocialists would fight to the bitter end the hateful order of things which\r\nhe was responsible for creating, and menacingly said, \"It will not be long\r\nbefore you find yourself entangled by it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nIn one respect Nicholas II differed from Alexander III--he was by nature\r\nmore humane and sentimental. Like his father, he was thoroughly dominated\r\nby Pobiedonostzev's theory that Russia, in order to be secure and stable,\r\nmust be based upon Nationality, Orthodoxy, and Autocracy. He wanted to see\r\nHoly Russia homogeneous and free from revolutionary disturbances. But his\r\nsensitive nature shrank from the systematic persecution of the non-orthodox\r\nsects and the Jews, and he quietly intimated to the officials that he would\r\nnot approve its continuance. At the same time, he was not willing to face\r\nthe issue squarely and openly announce a change of policy or restore\r\nreligious freedom. That would have meant the overthrow of Pobiedonostzev\r\nand the Czar's emancipation from his sinister influence, and for that\r\nNicholas II lacked the necessary courage and stamina. Cowardice and\r\nweakness of the will characterized his reign from the very beginning.\r\n\r\nWhen the officials, in obedience to their ruler's wishes, relaxed the\r\nseverity which had marked the treatment of the Jews and the non-orthodox\r\nChristian sects, the change was soon noted by the victims and once more\r\nthere was a revival of hope. But the efforts of the Finns to secure a\r\nmodification of the Russification policy were quite fruitless. When a\r\ndeputation was sent from Finland to represent to the Czar that the rights\r\nand privileges solemnly reserved to them at the time of the annexation were\r\nbeing denied to the people of Finland, Nicholas II refused to grant the\r\ndeputation an audience. Instead of getting relief, the people of Finland\r\nsoon found that the oppression steadily increased. It was evident that\r\nFinnish nationality was to be crushed out, if possible, in the interest of\r\nRussian homogeneity.\r\n\r\nIt soon became apparent, moreover, that Pobiedonostzev was to enjoy even\r\nmore power than he had under Alexander III. In proportion as the character\r\nof Nicholas II was weaker than that of his father, the power of the\r\nProcurator of the Holy Synod was greater. And there was a superstitious\r\nelement in the mentality of the new Czar which Pobiedonostzev played upon\r\nwith infinite cunning. He ruled the weak-willed Czar and filled the\r\nministries with men who shared his views and upon whom he could rely.\r\nNotwithstanding the Czar's expressed wishes, he soon found ways and means\r\nto add to the persecutions of the Jews and the various non-orthodox\r\nChristian sects. In his determination to hammer the varied racial groups\r\ninto a homogeneous nation, he adopted terrible measures and so roused the\r\nhatred of the Finns, Armenians, Georgians, and other subject peoples,\r\nstirring among them passionate resentment and desire for revolutionary\r\naction. It is impossible to conceive of a policy more dangerous to the\r\ndynasty than was conceived and followed by this fanatical Russophil. The\r\nPoles were persecuted and forced, in sheer despair, and by self-interest,\r\ninto the revolutionary movement. Armenians were persecuted and their church\r\nlands and church funds confiscated; so they, too, were forced into the\r\nrevolutionary current.\r\n\r\nWorse than all else was the cruel persecution of the Jews. Not only were\r\nthey compelled to live within the Pale of Settlement, but this was so\r\nreduced that abominable congestion and poverty resulted. Intolerable\r\nrestrictions were placed upon the facilities for education in the secondary\r\nschools, the gymnasia, and in the universities. It was hoped in this way to\r\ndestroy the intellectual leadership of the Jews. Pogroms were instigated,\r\nstirring the civilized world to protest at the horrible outrages. The\r\nMinister of the Interior, Von Plehve, proclaimed his intention to \"drown\r\nthe Revolution in Jewish blood,\" while Pobiedonostzev's ambition was \"to\r\nforce one-third of the Jews to conversion, another third to emigrate\"--to\r\nescape persecution. The other third he expected to die of hunger and\r\nmisery. When Leo Tolstoy challenged these infamies, and called upon the\r\ncivilized world on behalf of the victims, the Holy Synod denounced Tolstoy\r\nand his followers as a sect \"especially dangerous for the Orthodox Church\r\nand the state.\" Later, in 1900, the Holy Synod excommunicated Tolstoy from\r\nthe Orthodox Church.\r\n\r\nThe fatal logic of fanatical fury led to attacks upon the zemstvos. These\r\nlocal organizations had been instituted in 1864, by Alexander II, in the\r\nliberal years of his reign. Elected mainly by the landlords and the\r\npeasants, they were a vital part of the life of the nation. Possessing no\r\npolitical powers or functions, having nothing to do with legislation, they\r\nwere important agencies of local government. The representatives of each\r\ncounty constituted a county-zemstvo and the representatives elected by all\r\nthe county-zemstvos in a province constituted a province-zemstvo. Both\r\ntypes concerned themselves with much the same range of activities. They\r\nbuilt roads and telegraph stations; they maintained model farms and\r\nagricultural experiment stations similar to those maintained by our state\r\ngovernments. They maintained schools, bookstores, and libraries:\r\nco-operative stores; hospitals and banks. They provided the peasants with\r\ncheap credit, good seeds, fertilizers, agricultural implements, and so\r\nforth. In many cases they provided for free medical aid to the peasants. In\r\nsome instances they published newspapers and magazines.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the zemstvos were the only representative public\r\nbodies elected by any large part of the people. While the suffrage was\r\nquite undemocratic, being so arranged that the landlords were assured a\r\nmajority over the peasants at all times, nevertheless they did perform a\r\ngreat democratic service. But for them, life would have been well-nigh\r\nimpossible for the peasant. In addition to the services already enumerated,\r\nthese civic bodies were the relief agencies of the Empire, and when crop\r\nfailures brought famine to the peasants it was always the zemstvos which\r\nundertook the work of relief. Hampered at every point, denied the right to\r\ncontrol the schools they created and maintained, inhibited by law from\r\ndiscussing political questions, the zemstvos, nevertheless, became the\r\nnatural channels for the spreading of discontent and opposition to the\r\nrégime through private communication and discussion.\r\n\r\nTo bureaucrats of the type of Pobiedonostzev and Von Plehve, with their\r\nfanatical belief in autocracy, these organizations of the people were so\r\nmany plague spots. Not daring to suppress them altogether, they determined\r\nto restrict them at every opportunity. Some of the zemstvos were suspended\r\nand disbanded for certain periods of time. Individual members were exiled\r\nfor utterances which Von Plehve regarded as dangerous. The power of the\r\nzemstvos themselves was lessened by taking from them such important\r\nfunctions as the provisioning of famine-stricken districts and by limiting\r\nin the most arbitrary manner the amount of the budget permitted to each\r\nzemstvo. Since every decision of the zemstvos was subject to veto by the\r\ngovernors of the respective provinces, the government had at all times a\r\nformidable weapon at hand to use in its fight against the zemstvos. This\r\nweapon Von Plehve used with great effect; the most reasonable actions of\r\nthe zemstvos were vetoed for no other reason than hatred of any sort of\r\nrepresentative government.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe result of all this was to drive the zemstvos toward the revolutionary\r\nmovements of the peasants and the city workers. That the zemstvos were not\r\nnaturally inclined to radicalism and revolution needs no demonstration.\r\nEconomic interest, tradition, and environment all conspired to keep these\r\npopular bodies conservative. Landowners were always in the majority and in\r\ngeneral the zemstvos reflected the ideas and ideals of the enlightened\r\nwealthy and cultivated classes. The peasant representatives in the zemstvos\r\nwere generally peasants of the most successful and prosperous type, hating\r\nthe revolutionists and all their works. By means of a policy incredibly\r\ninsane these conservatively inclined elements of the population were goaded\r\nto revolt. The newspapers and magazines of the zemstvos became more and\r\nmore critical of the government, more and more outspoken in denunciation of\r\nexisting conditions. Presently, the leaders of the zemstvos followed the\r\nexample of the revolutionists and held a secret convention at which a\r\nprogram for common action was agreed upon. Thus they were resorting to\r\nillegal methods, exactly as the Socialists had done. Finally, many of the\r\nliberal zemstvo leaders formed themselves into a political party--the Union\r\nof Liberation--with a special organ of its own, called _Emancipation_. This\r\norgan, edited by the brilliant and courageous Peter Struve, was published\r\nin Stuttgart, Germany, and, since its circulation in Russia was forbidden,\r\nit had to be smuggled into the country and secretly circulated, just as the\r\nrevolutionary Socialist journals were. Thus another bond was established\r\nbetween two very different movements.\r\n\r\nAs was inevitable, revolutionary terrorism enormously increased. In the\r\ncities the working-men were drawn mainly into the Social Democratic\r\nWorking-men's party, founded by Plechanov and others in 1898, but the\r\npeasants, in so far as they were aroused at all, rallied around the\r\nstandard of the Socialist-Revolutionists, successors to the Will of the\r\nPeople party. This party was peculiarly a party of the peasants, just as\r\nthe party of Plechanov was peculiarly a party of industrial workers. It\r\nemphasized the land question above all else. It naturally scorned the view,\r\nlargely held by the Marxists in the other party, that Russia must wait\r\nuntil her industrial development was perfected before attempting to realize\r\nSocialism. It scorned the slow, legalistic methods and resolutely answered\r\nthe terrorism of Czarism by a terrorism of the people. It maintained a\r\nspecial department for carrying on this grim work. Its Central Committee\r\npassed sentences of death upon certain officials, and its decrees were\r\ncarried out by the members of its Fighting Organization. To this\r\norganization within the party belonged many of the ablest and most\r\nconsecrated men and women in Russia.\r\n\r\nA few illustrations will suffice to make clear the nature of this\r\nterroristic retaliation: In March, 1902, Sypiagin, the Minister of the\r\nInterior, was shot down as he entered his office by a member of the\r\nFighting Organization, Stephen Balmashev, who was disguised as an officer.\r\nSypiagin had been duly sentenced to death by the Central Committee. He had\r\nbeen responsible for upward of sixty thousand political arrests and for the\r\nsuffering of many exiles. Balmashev went to his death with heroic\r\nfortitude. In May, 1903, Gregory Gershuni and two associates executed the\r\nreactionary Governor of Ufa. Early in June, 1904, Borikov, Governor-General\r\nof Finland, was assassinated by a revolutionist. A month later, July 15th,\r\nthe infamous Von Plehve, who had been judged by the Central Committee and\r\nheld responsible for the Kishinev pogrom, was killed by a bomb thrown under\r\nthe wheels of his carriage by Sazanov, a member of the Fighting Force. The\r\ndeath of this cruel tyrant thrilled the world. In February, 1905, Ivan\r\nKaliaiev executed the death sentence which had been passed upon the\r\nruthless Governor-General of Moscow, the Grand-Duke Serghei Alexandrovich.\r\n\r\nThere was war in Russia--war between two systems of organized terrorism.\r\nSometimes the Czar and his Ministers weakened and promised concessions, but\r\nalways there was speedy reaction and, usually, an increased vigor of\r\noppression. The assassination of Von Plehve, however, for the first time\r\nreally weakened the government. Czarism was, in fact, already toppling. The\r\nnew Minister of the Interior, Von Plehve's successor, Prince\r\nSvyatpolk-Mirski, sought to meet the situation by a policy of compromise.\r\nWhile he maintained Von Plehve's methods of suppressing the radical\r\norganizations and their press, and using provocative agents to entrap\r\nrevolutionary leaders, he granted a certain degree of freedom to the\r\nmoderate press and adopted a relatively liberal attitude toward the\r\nzemstvos. By this means he hoped to avert the impending revolution.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of the new conditions, the leaders of the zemstvos\r\norganized a national convention. This the government forbade, but it had\r\nlost much of its power and the leaders of the movement ignored the order\r\nand proceeded to hold the convention. At this convention, held at St.\r\nPetersburg, November 6, 1904, attended by many of the ablest lawyers,\r\ndoctors, professors, scientists, and publicists in Russia, a resolution was\r\nadopted demanding that the government at once call representatives of the\r\npeople together for the purpose of setting up a constitutional government\r\nin Russia. It was a revolutionary act, a challenge to the autocracy, which\r\nthe latter dared not accept. On the contrary, in December the Czar issued\r\nan ambiguous ukase in which a number of concessions and reforms were\r\npromised, but carefully avoiding the fundamental issues at stake.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the war with Japan, unpopular from the first, had proved to be an\r\nunbroken series of military defeats and disasters for Russia. From the\r\nopening of the war in February to the end of the year the press had been\r\npermitted to publish very little real news concerning it, but it was not\r\npossible to hide for long the bitter truth. Taxes mounted higher and\r\nhigher, prices rose, and there was intense suffering, while the loss of\r\nlife was enormous. News of the utter failure and incompetence of the army\r\nand the navy seeped through. Here was Russia with a population three times\r\nas large as that of Japan, and with an annual budget of two billions as\r\nagainst Japan's paltry sixty millions, defeated at every turn. What did\r\nthis failure signify? In the first place, it signified the weakness and\r\nutter incompetence of the régime. It meant that imperialist expansion, with\r\na corresponding strengthening of the old régime, was out of the question.\r\nMost intelligent Russians, with no lack of real patriotism, rejoiced at the\r\nsuccession of defeats because it proved to the masses the unfitness of the\r\nbureaucracy.\r\n\r\nIt signified something else, also. There were many who remembered the\r\nscandals of the Turkish War, in 1877, when Bessarabia was recovered. At\r\nthat time there was a perfect riot of graft, corruption, and treachery,\r\nmuch of which came under the observation of the zemstvos of the border.\r\nHigh military officials trafficked in munitions and food-supplies. Food\r\nintended for the army was stolen and sold--sometimes, it was said, to the\r\nenemy. Materials were paid for, but never delivered to the army at all. The\r\narmy was demoralized and the Turks repulsed the Russians again and again.\r\nNow similar stories began to be circulated. Returning victims told stories\r\nof brutal treatment of the troops by officers; of wounded and dying men\r\nneglected; of lack of hospital care and medical attention. They told worse\r\nstories, too, of open treachery by military officials and others; of army\r\nsupplies stolen; of shells ordered which would fit no guns the Russian army\r\never had, and so on. It was suggested, and widely believed, that Germany\r\nhad connived at the systematic corruption of the Russian bureaucracy and\r\nthe Russian army, to serve its own imperialistic and economic ends.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of Russia at the end of the year 1904. Then came the\r\ntragic events of January, 1905, which marked the opening of the Revolution.\r\nIn order to counteract the agitation of the Social Democrats among the city\r\nworkers, and the formation by them of trades-unions, the government had\r\ncaused to be formed \"legal\" unions--that is, organizations of workmen\r\napproved by the government. In order to give these organizations some\r\nsemblance to real labor-unions, and thereby the better to deceive the\r\nworkers, strikes were actually inspired by agents of the government from\r\ntime to time. On more than one occasion strikes thus instigated by the\r\ngovernment spread beyond control and caused great alarm. The Czar and his\r\nagents were playing with fire.\r\n\r\nAmong such unions was the Gathering of Industrial Working-men of St.\r\nPetersburg, which had for its program such innocent and non-revolutionary\r\nobjects as \"sober and reasonable pastimes, aimed at physical, intellectual,\r\nand moral improvement; strengthening of Russian national ideas; development\r\nof sensible views concerning the rights and duties of working-men and\r\nimprovement of labor conditions and mutual assistance.\" It was founded by\r\nFather Gapon, who was opposed to the revolutionary movement, and was\r\nregarded by the Socialists as a Czarist tool.\r\n\r\nOn January 3d--Russian calendar--several thousand men belonging to the\r\nGathering of Industrial Workin-gmen of St. Petersburg went out on strike.\r\nBy the 6th the strike had assumed the dimensions of a general strike. It\r\nwas estimated that on the latter date fully one hundred and forty thousand\r\nmen were out on strike, practically paralyzing the industrial life of the\r\ncity. At meetings of the strikers speeches were made which had as much to\r\ndo with the political demands for constitutional government as with the\r\noriginal grievances of the strikers. The strike was fast becoming a\r\nrevolution. On the 9th Father Gapon led the hosts to the Winter Palace, to\r\npresent a petition to the Czar asking for reforms. The text of the petition\r\nwas widely circulated beforehand. It begged the Czar to order immediately\r\n\"that representatives of all the Russian land, of all classes and groups,\r\nconvene.\" It outlined a moderate program which had the support of almost\r\nthe entire nation with the exception of the bureaucracy:\r\n\r\n    Let every one be equal and free in the right of election; order to\r\n    this end that election for the Constituent Assembly be based on\r\n    general, equal, direct, and secret suffrage. This is our main\r\n    request; in it and upon it everything is founded; this is the only\r\n    ointment for our painful wounds; and in the absence of this our\r\n    blood will continue to flow constantly, carrying us swiftly toward\r\n    death.\r\n\r\n    But this measure alone cannot remedy all our wounds. Many others\r\n    are necessary, and we tell them to you, Sire, directly and openly,\r\n    as to our Father. We need:\r\n\r\n    _I. Measures to counteract the ignorance and legal oppression of\r\n    the Russian people_:\r\n\r\n    (1) Personal freedom and inviolability, freedom of speech and the\r\n    press, freedom of assemblage, freedom in religious affairs;\r\n\r\n    (2) General and compulsory public education at the expense of the\r\n    state;\r\n\r\n    (3) Responsibility of the Ministers to the people, and guaranties\r\n    of lawfulness in administration;\r\n\r\n    (4) Equality before the law for all without exemption;\r\n\r\n    (5) Immediate rehabilitation of those punished for their\r\n    convictions.\r\n\r\n    (6) Separation of the Church from the state.\r\n\r\n    _II. Measures against the poverty of the people_:\r\n\r\n    (1) Abolition of indirect taxes and introduction of direct income\r\n    taxes on a progressive scale;\r\n\r\n    (2) Abolition of the redemption payments, cheap credit, and\r\n    gradual transferring of the land to the people;\r\n\r\n    (3) The orders for the naval and military Ministers should be\r\n    filled in Russia and not abroad;\r\n\r\n    (4) The cessation of the war by the will of the people.\r\n\r\n    _III. Measures against oppression of labor by capital_:\r\n\r\n    (1) Protection of labor by legislation;\r\n\r\n    (2) Freedom of consumers' and producers' leagues and\r\n    trades-unions;\r\n\r\n    (3) An eight-hour workday and a regulation of overtime;\r\n\r\n    (4) Freedom of struggle against capital (freedom of labor\r\n    strikes);\r\n\r\n    (5) Participation of labor representatives in the framing of a\r\n    bill concerning state insurance of working-men;\r\n\r\n    (6) Normal wages.\r\n\r\n    Those are, Sire, the principal wants with which we have come to\r\n    you. Let your decree be known, swear that you will satisfy them,\r\n    and you will make Russia happy and glorious, and your name will be\r\n    branded in our hearts and in the hearts of our posterity for ever\r\n    and ever. If, however, you will not reply to our prayer, we shall\r\n    die here, on the place before your palace. We have no other refuge\r\n    and no other means. We have two roads before us, one to freedom\r\n    and happiness, the other to the grave. Tell us, Sire, which, and\r\n    we will follow obediently, and if it be the road of death, let our\r\n    lives be a sacrifice for suffering-wearied Russia. We do not\r\n    regret the sacrifice; we bring it willingly.\r\n\r\nLed on by the strange, hypnotic power of the mystical Father Gapon, who was\r\nclad in the robes of his office, tens of thousands of working-people\r\nmarched that day to the Winter Palace, confident that the Czar would see\r\nthem, receive their petitions, and harken to their prayers. It was not a\r\nrevolutionary demonstration in the accepted sense of that term; the\r\nmarchers did not carry red flags nor sing Socialist songs of revolt.\r\nInstead, they bore pictures of the Czar and other members of the royal\r\nfamily and sang \"God Save the Czar\" and other well-known religious hymns.\r\nNo attempt was made to prevent the procession from reaching the square in\r\nfront of the Winter Palace. Suddenly, without a word of warning, troops\r\nappeared from the courtyards, where they were hidden, and fired into the\r\ncrowded mass of human beings, killing more than five hundred and wounding\r\nnearly three thousand. All who were able to do so turned and fled, among\r\nthem Father Gapon.\r\n\r\nBloody Sunday, as the day is known in Russian annals, is generally regarded\r\nas the beginning of the First Revolution. Immediately people began to talk\r\nof armed resistance. On the evening of the day of the tragedy there was a\r\nmeeting of more than seven hundred Intellectuals at which the means for\r\ncarrying on revolution was the topic discussed. This was the first of many\r\nsimilar gatherings which took place all over Russia. Soon the Intellectuals\r\nbegan to organize unions, ostensibly for the protection of their\r\nprofessional interests, but in reality for political purposes. There were\r\nunions of doctors, writers, lawyers, engineers, professors, editors, and so\r\non. Quietly, and almost without design, there was being effected another\r\nand more important union, namely, the union of all classes against\r\nautocracy and despotism.\r\n\r\nThe Czar gave from his private purse fifty thousand rubles for the relief\r\nof the families of the victims of Bloody Sunday. On the 19th of January he\r\nreceived a deputation of carefully selected \"loyal\" working-men and\r\ndelivered to them a characteristic homily, which infuriated the masses by\r\nits stupid perversion of the facts connected with the wanton massacre of\r\nBloody Sunday. Then, at the end of the month, he proclaimed the appointment\r\nof a commission to \"investigate the causes of labor unrest in St.\r\nPetersburg and its suburbs and to find means of avoiding them in the\r\nfuture.\" This commission was to consist of representatives of capital and\r\nlabor. The working-men thereupon made the following demands:\r\n\r\n(1) That labor be given an equal number of members in the commission with\r\ncapital;\r\n\r\n(2) That the working-men be permitted to freely elect their own\r\nrepresentatives;\r\n\r\n(3) That the sessions of the commission be open to the public;\r\n\r\n(4) That there be complete freedom of speech for the representatives of\r\nlabor in the commission;\r\n\r\n(5) That all the working-people arrested on January 9th be released.\r\n\r\nThese demands of the working-men's organizations were rejected by the\r\ngovernment, whereupon the workers agreed to boycott the commission and\r\nrefuse to have anything to do with it. At last it became evident to the\r\ngovernment that, in the circumstances, the commission could not accomplish\r\nany good, and it was therefore abandoned. The Czar and his advisers were\r\ndesperate and vacillating. One day they would adopt a conciliatory attitude\r\ntoward the workers, and the next day follow it up with fresh measures of\r\nrepression and punishment.\r\n\r\nLittle heeding the stupid charge by the Holy Synod that the revolutionary\r\nleaders were in the pay of the Japanese, the workers went on organizing and\r\nstriking. All over Russia there were strikes, the movement had spread far\r\nbeyond the bounds of St. Petersburg. General strikes took place in many of\r\nthe large cities, such as Riga, Vilna, Libau, Warsaw, Lodz, Batum, Minsk,\r\nTiflis, and many others. Conflicts between strikers and soldiers and police\r\nwere common. Russia was aflame with revolution. The movement spread to the\r\npeasants in a most surprising manner. Numerous extensive and serious\r\nrevolts of peasants occurred in different parts of Russia, the peasants\r\nlooting the mansions of the landowners, and indulging in savage outbreaks\r\nof rioting.\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on the army was being completely demoralized. The\r\nterrible defeat of the Russian forces by the Japanese--the foe that had\r\nbeen so lightly regarded--at Mukden was a crushing blow which greatly\r\nimpaired the morale of the troops, both those at home and those at the\r\nfront. Disaster followed upon disaster. May saw the destruction of the\r\ngreat Russian fleet. In June rebellion broke out in the navy, and the crew\r\nof the battle-ship _Potyamkin_, which was on the Black Sea, mutinied and\r\nhoisted the red flag. After making prisoners of their officers, the sailors\r\nhastened to lend armed assistance to striking working-men at Odessa who\r\nwere in conflict with soldiers and police.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nIt was a time of turbulent unrest and apparent utter confusion. It was not\r\neasy to discern the underlying significance and purpose of some of the most\r\nimportant events. On every hand there were strikes and uprisings, many of\r\nthem without any sort of leadership or plan. Strikes which began over\r\nquestions of wages and hours became political demonstrations in favor of a\r\nConstituent Assembly. On the other hand, political demonstrations became\r\ntransformed, without any conscious effort on the part of anybody, into\r\nstrikes for immediate economic betterment. There was an intense class\r\nconflict going on in Russia, as the large number of strikes for increased\r\nwages and shorter hours proved, yet the larger political struggle dwarfed\r\nand obscured the class struggle. For the awakened proletariat of the\r\ncities the struggle in which they were engaged was economic as well as\r\npolitical. They wisely regarded the political struggle as part of the class\r\nstruggle, as Plechanov and his friends declared it to be. Yet the fact\r\nremained that the capitalist class against which the proletariat was\r\nfighting on the economic field was, for the most part, fighting against\r\nautocracy, for the overthrow of Czarism and the establishment of political\r\ndemocracy, as earnestly, if less violently, than the proletariat was. The\r\nreason for this was the recognition by the leading capitalists of Russia of\r\nthe fact that industrial progress was retarded by the old régime, and that\r\ncapitalist development requires popular education, a relatively high\r\nstandard of living, political freedom, and stability and order in\r\ngovernment. It was perfectly natural, therefore, for the great associations\r\nof manufacturers and merchants to unite in urging the government to grant\r\nextensive political reforms so long as the class conflict was merely\r\nincidental.\r\n\r\nWhat had begun mainly as a class war had become the war of all classes\r\nagainst autocracy. Of course, in such a merging of classes there\r\nnecessarily appeared many shadings and degrees of interest. Not all the\r\nsocial groups and classes were as radical in their demands as the organized\r\npeasants and city workers, who were the soul of the revolutionary movement.\r\nThere were, broadly speaking, two great divisions of social life with which\r\nthe Revolution was concerned--the political and the economic. With regard\r\nto the first there was practical unanimity; he would be a blind slave to\r\ntheoretical formulæ who sought to maintain the thesis that class interests\r\ndivided masses and classes here. All classes, with the exception of the\r\nbureaucracy, wanted the abolition of Czarism and Absolutism and the\r\nestablishment of a constitutional government, elected by the people on a\r\nbasis of universal suffrage, and directly responsible to the electorate.\r\n\r\nUpon the economic issue there was less agreement, though all parties and\r\nclasses recognized the need of extensive change. It was universally\r\nrecognized that some solution of the land question must be found. There can\r\nnever be social peace or political stability in Russia until that problem\r\nis settled. Now, it was easy for the Socialist groups, on the one hand, and\r\nthe moderate groups, upon the other, to unite in demanding that the large\r\nestates be divided among the peasants. But while the Socialist\r\ngroups--those of the peasants as well as those of city workers--demanded\r\nthat the land be taken without compensation, the bourgeois elements,\r\nespecially the leaders of the zemstvos, insisted that the state should pay\r\ncompensation for the land taken. Judgment upon this vital question has long\r\nbeen embittered by the experience of the peasants with the \"redemption\r\npayments\" which were established when serfdom was abolished. During the\r\nperiod of greatest intensity, the summer of 1905, a federation of the\r\nvarious revolutionary peasants' organizations was formed and based its\r\npolicy upon the middle ground of favoring the payment of compensation _in\r\nsome cases_.\r\n\r\nAll through this trying period the Czar and his advisers were temporizing\r\nand attempting to obtain peace by means of petty concessions. A greater\r\ndegree of religious liberty was granted, and a new representative body, the\r\nImperial Duma, was provided for. This body was not to be a parliament in\r\nany real sense, but a debating society. It could _discuss_ proposed\r\nlegislation, but it had no powers to _enact_ legislation of any kind.\r\nAbsolutism was dying hard, clinging to its powers with remarkable tenacity.\r\nOf course, the concessions did not satisfy the revolutionists, not even\r\nthe most moderate sections, and the net result was to intensify rather than\r\nto diminish the flame.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of August--10th, according to the old Russian calendar--the war\r\nwith Japan came to an end with the signing of the Treaty of Portsmouth.\r\nRussia had experienced humiliating and disastrous defeat at the hands of a\r\nnation far inferior in population and wealth, but infinitely superior in\r\nmilitary capacity and morale. The news of the conditions of peace\r\nintensified the ardor and determination of the revolting Russian people\r\nand, on the other hand, added to the already great weakness of the\r\ngovernment. September witnessed a great revival of revolutionary agitation,\r\nand by the end of the month a fresh epidemic of strikes had broken out in\r\nvarious parts of the country. By the middle of October the whole life of\r\nRussia, civil, industrial, and commercial, was a chaos. In some of the\r\ncities the greater part of the population had placed themselves in a state\r\nof siege, under revolutionary leadership.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of October--Russian style--the Czar issued the famous Manifesto\r\nwhich acknowledged the victory of the people and the death of Absolutism.\r\nAfter the usual amount of pietistic verbiage by way of introduction the\r\nManifesto said:\r\n\r\n    We make it the duty of the government to execute our firm will:\r\n\r\n    (1) To grant the people the unshakable foundations of civic\r\n    freedom on the basis of real personal inviolability, freedom of\r\n    conscience, of speech, of assemblage of unions.\r\n\r\n    (2) To admit now to participation in the Imperial Duma, without\r\n    stopping the pending elections and in so far as it is feasible in\r\n    the short time remaining before the convening of the Duma, all the\r\n    classes of the population, _leaving the farther development of the\r\n    principle of universal suffrage to the new legislative order._\r\n\r\n    (3) _To establish as an unshakable rule that no law can become\r\n    binding without the consent of the Imperial Duma, and that the\r\n    representatives of the people must be guaranteed a real\r\n    participation in the control over the lawfulness of the\r\n    authorities appointed by us_.\r\n\r\n    We call upon all faithful sons of Russia to remember their duty to\r\n    their fatherland, to aid in putting an end to the unprecedented\r\n    disturbances, and to exert with us all their power to restore\r\n    quiet and peace in our native land.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nThe Czar's Manifesto rang through the civilized world. In all lands it was\r\nhailed as the end of despotism and the triumph of democracy and freedom.\r\nThe joy of the Russian people was unbounded. At last, after fourscore years\r\nof heroic struggle and sacrifice by countless heroes, named and nameless,\r\nthe goal of freedom was attained. Men, women, and children sang in the\r\nstreets to express their joy. Red flags were displayed everywhere and\r\nsolemnly saluted by the officers and men of the Czar's army. But the\r\nrejoicing was premature, as the events of a few hours clearly proved. With\r\nthat fatal vacillation which characterized his whole life, Nicholas II had\r\nno sooner issued his Manifesto than he surrendered once more to the evil\r\nforces by which he was surrounded and harked back to the old ways. The day\r\nfollowing the issuance of the Manifesto, while the people were still\r\nrejoicing, there began a series of terrible pogroms. The cry went forth,\r\n\"Kill the Intellectuals and the Jews!\"\r\n\r\nThere had been organized in support of the government, and by its agents,\r\nbodies of so-called \"patriots.\" These were, in the main, recruited from the\r\nunderworld, a very large number of them being criminals who were released\r\nfrom the prison for the purpose. Officially known as the Association of\r\nthe Russian People and the Association to Combat the Revolution, these\r\norganizations were popularly nicknamed the Black Hundreds. Most of the\r\nmembers were paid directly by the government for their services, while\r\nothers were rewarded with petty official positions. The Czar himself\r\naccepted membership in these infamous organizations of hired assassins.\r\nWithin three weeks after the issuance of the Manifesto more than a hundred\r\norganized pogroms took place, the number of killed amounting to nearly four\r\nthousand; the wounded to more than ten thousand, according to the most\r\ncompetent authorities. In Odessa alone more than one thousand persons were\r\nkilled and many thousands wounded in a four-days' massacre. In all the\r\nbloody pages of the history of the Romanovs there is nothing comparable to\r\nthe frightful terror of this period.\r\n\r\nNaturally, this brutal vengeance and the deception which Nicholas II and\r\nhis advisers had practised upon the people had the immediate effect of\r\nincreasing the relative strength and prestige of the Socialists in the\r\nrevolutionary movement as against the less radical elements. To meet such\r\nbrutality and force only the most extreme measures were deemed adequate.\r\nThe Council of Workmen's Deputies, which had been organized by the\r\nproletariat of St. Petersburg a few days before the Czar issued his\r\nManifesto, now became a great power, the central guiding power of the\r\nRevolution. Similar bodies were organized in other great cities. The\r\nexample set by the city workers was followed by the peasants in many places\r\nand Councils of Peasants' Deputies were organized. In a few cases large\r\nnumbers of soldiers, making common cause with these bodies representing the\r\nworking class, formed Councils of Soldiers' Deputies. Here, then, was a new\r\nphenomenon; betrayed by the state, weary of the struggle to democratize\r\nand liberalize the political state, the workers had established a sort of\r\nrevolutionary self-government of a new kind, entirely independent of the\r\nstate. We shall never comprehend the later developments in Russia,\r\nespecially the phenomenon of Bolshevism, unless we have a sympathetic\r\nunderstanding of these Soviets--autonomous, non-political units of\r\nworking-class self-government, composed of delegates elected directly by\r\nthe workers.\r\n\r\nAs the revolutionary resistance to the Black Hundreds increased, and the\r\nrapidly growing Soviets of workmen's, peasants' and soldiers' delegates\r\nasserted a constantly increasing indifference to the existing political\r\nstate, the government again tried to stem the tide by making concessions.\r\nOn November 3d--new style--in a vain attempt to appease the incessant\r\ndemand for the release of the thousands of political prisoners, and to put\r\nan end to the forcible release of such prisoners by infuriated mobs, a\r\npartial amnesty was declared. On the 16th a sop was thrown to the peasants\r\nin the shape of a decree abolishing all the remaining land-redemption\r\npayments. Had this reform come sooner it might have had the effect of\r\nstemming the tide of revolt among the peasants, but in the circumstances it\r\nwas of no avail. Early in December the press censorship was abolished by\r\ndecree, but that was of very little importance, for the radical press had\r\nthrown off all its restraints, simply ignoring the censorship. The\r\ngovernment of Nicholas II was quite as helpless as it was tyrannical,\r\ncorrupt, and inefficient. The army and navy, demoralized by the defeat\r\nsuffered at the hands of Japan, and especially by knowledge of the\r\ncorruption in high places which made that defeat inevitable, were no longer\r\ndependable. Tens of thousands of soldiers and marines had joined with the\r\nworkmen in the cities in open rebellion. Many more indulged themselves in\r\npurposeless rioting.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the various councils of delegates representing\r\nfactory-workers and peasants, inevitable as it seemed to be, had one\r\ndisastrous effect, the seriousness of which cannot be overstated. As we\r\nhave seen, the cruel, blundering policy of the government had united all\r\nclasses against it in a revolutionary movement of unexampled magnitude.\r\nGiven the conditions prevailing in Russia, and especially the lack of\r\nindustrial development and the corresponding numerical weakness of the\r\nindustrial proletariat, it was evident that the only chance of success in\r\nthe Revolution lay in the united effort of all classes against the old\r\nrégime. Nothing could have better served the autocracy, and therefore\r\ninjured the revolutionary cause, than the creation of a division in the\r\nranks of the revolutionists.\r\n\r\nThis was exactly what the separate organizations of the working class\r\naccomplished. All the provocative agents of the Czar could not have\r\ncontrived anything so serviceable to the reaction. _Divide et impera_ has\r\nbeen the guiding principle of cunning despots in all ages, and the astutest\r\nadvisers of Nicholas II must have grinned with Satanic glee when they\r\nrealized how seriously the forces they were contending against were\r\ndividing. Stupid oppression had driven into one united force the\r\nwage-earning and wage-paying classes. Working-men and manufacturers made\r\ncommon cause against that stupid oppression. Now, however, as the\r\ninevitable result of the organization of the Soviets, and the predominance\r\nof these in the Revolution, purely economic issues came to the front. In\r\nproportion as the class struggle between employers and employed was\r\naccentuated the common struggle against autocracy was minimized and\r\nobscured. Numerous strikes for increased wages occurred, forcing the\r\nemployers to organize resistance. Workers in one city--St. Petersburg, for\r\nexample--demanded the immediate introduction of an eight-hour workday, and\r\nproclaimed it to be in force, quite regardless of the fact that longer\r\nhours prevailed elsewhere and that, given the competitive system, their\r\nemployers were bound to resist a demand that would be a handicap favoring\r\ntheir competitors.\r\n\r\nAs might have been foreseen, the employers were forced to rely upon the\r\ngovernment, the very government they had denounced and conspired to\r\noverthrow. The president of the Council of Workmen's Deputies of St.\r\nPetersburg, Chrustalev-Nosar, in his _History of the Council of Workmen's\r\nDeputies_, quotes the order adopted by acclamation on November 11th--new\r\nstyle--introducing, from November 13th, an eight-hour workday in all shops\r\nand factories \"in a revolutionary way.\" By way of commentary, he quotes a\r\nfurther order, adopted November 25, repealing the former order and\r\ndeclaring:\r\n\r\n    The government, headed by Count Witte, _in its endeavor to break\r\n    the vigor of the revolutionary proletariat, came to the support of\r\n    capital_, thus turning the question of an eight-hour workday in\r\n    St. Petersburg into a national problem. The consequence has been\r\n    that the working-men of St. Petersburg are unable now, apart from\r\n    the working-men of the entire country, to realize the decree of\r\n    the Council. The Council of Workmen's Deputies, therefore, deems\r\n    it necessary to _stop temporarily the immediate and general\r\n    establishment of an eight-hour workday by force_.\r\n\r\nThe Councils inaugurated general strike after general strike. At first\r\nthese strikes were successful from a revolutionary point of view. Soon,\r\nhowever, it became apparent that the general strike is a weapon which can\r\nonly be used effectively on rare occasions. It is impossible to rekindle\r\nfrequently and at will the sacrificial passion necessary to make a\r\nsuccessful general strike. This the leaders of the proletariat of Russia\r\noverlooked. They overlooked, also, the fact that the masses of the workers\r\nwere exhausted by the long series of strikes in which they had engaged and\r\nwere on the verge of starvation. The consequence was that most of the later\r\nstrikes failed to accomplish anything like the ends sought.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the government was recovering its confidence and its courage in\r\nproportion to the class divisions and antagonisms of the opposition. It\r\nonce more suppressed the revolutionary press and prohibited meetings. Once\r\nmore it proclaimed martial law in many cities. With all its old-time\r\nassurance it caused the arrest of the leaders of the unions of workmen and\r\npeasants, broke up the organizations and imprisoned their officers. It\r\nissued a decree which made it a crime to participate in strikes. With the\r\nfull sanction of the government, as was shown by the publication of\r\ndocumentary evidence of unquestioned authenticity, the Black Hundreds\r\nrenewed their brutality. The strong Council of Workmen's Deputies of St.\r\nPetersburg, with which Witte had dealt as though it were part of the\r\ngovernment itself, was broken up and suppressed. Witte wanted\r\nconstitutional government on the basis of the October Manifesto, but he\r\nwanted the orderly development of Russian capitalism. In this attitude he\r\nwas supported, of course, by the capitalist organizations. The very men who\r\nin the summer of 1905 had demanded that the government grant the demands of\r\nthe workers and so end the strikes, and who worked in unison with the\r\nworkers to secure the much-desired political freedom, six months later were\r\ndemanding that the government suppress the strikes and exert its force to\r\nend disorder.\r\n\r\nRecognition of these facts need not imply any lack of sympathy with the\r\nproletariat in their demands. The class struggle in modern industrial\r\nsociety is a fact, and there is abundant justification--the justification\r\nof necessity and of achievement--for aggressive class consciousness and\r\nclass warfare. But it is quite obvious that there are times when class\r\ninterests and class warfare must be set aside in favor of larger social\r\ninterests. It is obviously dangerous and reactionary--and therefore\r\nwrong--to insist upon strikes or other forms of class warfare in moments of\r\ngreat calamity, as, for example, during disasters like the Johnstown flood\r\nand the Messina earthquake, or amid the ravages of a pestilential plague.\r\nMarx, to whom we owe the formulation of the theory of class struggle which\r\nhas guided the Socialist movement, would never have questioned this\r\nimportant truth; he would never have supported class separatism under\r\nconditions such as those prevailing in Russia at the end of 1905. Only\r\ndoctrinaires, slaves to formulæ, but blind to reality, could have\r\nsanctioned such separatism. But doctrinaires always abound in times of\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nBy December the government was stronger than it had been at any time since\r\nthe Revolution began. The zemstvos were no longer an active part of the\r\nrevolutionary movement. Indeed, there had come over these bodies a great\r\nchange, and most of them were now dominated by relatively reactionary\r\nlandowners who, hitherto apathetic and indifferent, had been stirred to\r\ndefensive action by the aggressive class warfare of the workers.\r\nPractically all the bourgeois moderates had been driven to the more or less\r\nopen support of the government. December witnessed a new outburst in St.\r\nPetersburg, Moscow, and other cities. Barricades were raised in the streets\r\nin many places. In Moscow, where the most bitter and sanguinary struggles\r\ntook place, more than a thousand persons were killed. The government was\r\nbetter prepared than the workers; the army had recovered no little of its\r\nlost morale and did not refuse to shoot down the workers as it had done on\r\nprevious occasions. The strikes and insurrections were put down in bloody\r\nvengeance and there followed a reign of brutal repression indescribably\r\nhorrible and savage. By way of protest and retaliation, there were\r\nindividual acts of terrorism, such as the execution of the Governor of\r\nTambov by Marie Spiridonova, but these were of little or no avail. The\r\nFirst Revolution was drowned in blood and tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nFROM REVOLUTION TO REVOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nNo struggle for human freedom was ever wholly vain. No matter how vast and\r\nseemingly complete the failure, there is always something of enduring good\r\nachieved. That is the law of progress, universal and immutable. The First\r\nRussian Revolution conformed to the law; it had failed and died in a tragic\r\nway, yet its failure was relative and it left something of substantial\r\nachievement as the foundation for fresh hope, courage, and effort. Czarism\r\nhad gathered all its mighty black forces and seemed, at the beginning of\r\n1906, to be stronger than at any time in fifty years. The souls of Russia's\r\nnoblest and best sons and daughters were steeped in bitter pessimism. And\r\nyet there was reason for hope and rejoicing; out of the ruin and despair\r\ntwo great and supremely vital facts stood in bold, challenging relief.\r\n\r\nThe first of these facts was the new aspect of Czarism, its changed status.\r\nAbsolutism as a legal institution was dead. Nothing that Nicholas II and\r\nhis advisers were able to do could undo the constitutional changes effected\r\nwhen the imperial edict made it part of the fundamental law of the nation\r\nthat \"no law can become binding without the consent of the Imperial Duma,\"\r\nand that the Duma, elected by the people, had the right to control the\r\nactions of the officials of the government, even when such officials were\r\nappointed by the Czar himself. Absolutism was illegal now. Attempts might\r\nbe made to reintroduce it, and, indeed, that was the real significance of\r\nthe policy pursued by the government, but Absolutism could no longer\r\npossess the moral strength that inheres in the sanctity of law. In fighting\r\nit the Russian people now had that strength upon their side.\r\n\r\nThe second vital and hopeful fact was likewise a moral force. Absolutism\r\nwith all its assumed divine prerogatives, in the person of the Czar, had\r\ndeclared its firm will \"to grant the people the unshakable foundations of\r\ncivic freedom on the basis of real personal inviolability, freedom of\r\nconscience, of speech, of assemblage and of unions.\" This civic freedom\r\nAbsolutism had sanctioned. By that act it gave the prestige of legality to\r\nsuch assemblages, discussions, and publications as had always hitherto been\r\nforced to accept risks and disabilities inseparable from illegal conduct.\r\nCivic freedom had long been outlawed, a thing associated with lawlessness\r\nand crime, and so long as that condition remained many who believed in\r\ncivic freedom itself, who wanted a free press, freedom of public assemblage\r\nand of conscience in matters pertaining to religion, were kept from\r\nparticipation in the struggle. Respect for law, as law, is deeply rooted in\r\ncivilized mankind--a fact which, while it makes the task of the\r\nrevolutionist hard, and at times impedes progress, is, nevertheless, of\r\nimmense value to human society.\r\n\r\nCivic freedom was not yet a fact. It seemed, as a reality, to be as far\r\naway as ever. Meetings were forbidden by officials and broken up by\r\nsoldiers and police; newspapers were suppressed, as of old; labor-unions,\r\nand even the unions of the Intellectuals, were ruthlessly persecuted and\r\ntreated as conspiracies against the state. All this and more was true and\r\ndiscouraging. Yet there was substantial gain: civic freedom as a practical\r\nfact did not exist, but civic freedom as a lawful right lived in the minds\r\nof millions of people--the greatest fact in Russia. The terms of the\r\nManifesto of October 17th--Absolutism's solemn covenant with the\r\nnation--had not been repealed, and the nation knew that the government did\r\nnot dare to repeal it. Not all the Czar's armies and Black Hundreds could\r\ndestroy that consciousness of the lawful right to civic freedom. Nothing\r\ncould restore the old condition. Whereas in the past the government, in\r\nsuppressing the press and popular assemblages, could say to the people, \"We\r\nuphold the law!\" now when the government attempted these things, the people\r\ndefiantly cried out, \"You break the law!\" Absolutism was no longer a thing\r\nof law.\r\n\r\nNicholas II and all his bureaucrats could not return the chicken to the egg\r\nfrom which it had been hatched. They could not unsay the fateful words\r\nwhich called into being the Imperial Duma. The Revolution had put into\r\ntheir souls a terrible fear of the wrath of the people. The Czar and his\r\ngovernment had to permit the election of the Duma to proceed, and yet,\r\nconscious of the fact that the success of the Duma inevitably meant the end\r\nof the old régime, they were bound, in self-protection, to attempt to kill\r\nthe Duma in the hope that thereby they would kill, or at least paralyze,\r\nthe Revolution itself. Thus it was, while not daring to forbid the\r\nelections for the Duma to proceed, the government adopted a Machiavellian\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nThe essentials of that policy were these: on the one hand, the Duma was not\r\nto be seriously considered at all, when it should assemble. It would be\r\nignored, if possible, and no attention paid to any of its deliberations or\r\nattempts to legislate. A certain amount of latitude would be given to it\r\nas a debating society, a sort of safety-valve, but that was all. If this\r\npolicy could not be carried out in its entirety, if, for example, it should\r\nprove impossible to completely ignore the Duma, it would be easy enough to\r\ndevise a mass of hampering restrictions and regulations which would render\r\nit impotent, and yet necessitate no formal repudiation of the October\r\nManifesto. On the other hand, there was the possibility that the Duma might\r\nbe captured and made a safe ally. The suffrage upon which the elections\r\nwere to be based was most undemocratic and unjust, giving to the landlords\r\nand the prosperous peasants, together with the wealthy classes in the\r\ncities, an enormous preponderance in the electorate. By using the Black\r\nHundreds to work among the electors--bribing, cajoling, threatening, and\r\ncoercing, as the occasion might require--it might be possible to bring\r\nabout the election of a Duma which would be a pliant and ready tool of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nOne of the favorite devices of the Black Hundreds was to send agents among\r\nthe workers in the cities and among the peasants to discredit the Duma in\r\nadvance, and to spread the idea that it would only represent the\r\nbourgeoisie. Many of the most influential Socialist leaders unfortunately\r\npreached the same doctrine. This was the natural and logical outcome of the\r\nseparate action of the classes in the Revolution, and of the manner in\r\nwhich the proletariat had forced the economic struggle to the front during\r\nthe political struggle. In the vanguard of the fight for the Duma were the\r\nConstitutional Democrats, led by Miliukov, Prince Lvov, and many prominent\r\nleaders of the zemstvos. The divorce between the classes represented by\r\nthese men and the proletariat represented by the Social Democrats was\r\nabsolute. It was not surprising that the leaders of the Social Democratic\r\nparty should be suspicious and distrustful of the Constitutional Democrats\r\nand refuse to co-operate with them.\r\n\r\nBut many of the Social Democrats went much farther than this, and, in the\r\nname of Socialism and proletarian class consciousness, adopted the same\r\nattitude toward the Duma itself as that which the agents of the Black\r\nHundreds were urging upon the people. Among the Socialist leaders who took\r\nthis position was Vladimir Ulyanov, the great propagandist whom the world\r\nknows to-day as Nikolai Lenine, Bolshevik Prime Minister and Dictator.\r\nLenine urged the workers to boycott the Duma and to refuse to participate\r\nin the elections in any manner whatever. At a time when only a united\r\neffort by all classes could be expected to accomplish anything, and when\r\nsuch a victory of the people over the autocratic régime as might have been\r\nsecured by united action would have meant the triumph of the Revolution,\r\nLenine preached separatism. Unfortunately, his influence, even at that\r\ntime, was very great and his counsels prevailed with a great many Socialist\r\ngroups over the wiser counsels of Plechanov and others.\r\n\r\nIt may be said, in explanation and extenuation of Lenine's course, that the\r\nboycotting of the elections was the logical outcome of the class antagonism\r\nand separatism, and that the bourgeois leaders were just as much\r\nresponsible for the separatism as the leaders of the proletariat were. All\r\nthis is true. It is quite true to say that wiser leadership of the\r\nmanufacturing class in the critical days of 1905 would have made\r\nconcessions and granted many of the demands of the striking workmen. By so\r\ndoing they might have maintained unity in the political struggle. But, even\r\nif so much be granted, it is poor justification and defense of a Socialist\r\npolicy to say that it was neither better nor worse, neither more stupid nor\r\nmore wise, than that of the bourgeoisie! In the circumstances, Lenine's\r\npolicy was most disastrous for Russia. It is not necessary to believe the\r\ncharge that was made at the time and afterward that Lenine was in the pay\r\nof the government and a tool of the Black Hundreds. Subsequent incidents\r\nserved to fasten grave suspicion upon him, but no one ever offered proof of\r\ncorruption. In all probability, he was then, and throughout the later\r\nyears, honest and sincere--a fanatic, often playing a dangerous game,\r\nunmoral rather than immoral, believing that the end he sought justified any\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWhen the elections for the Duma were held, in March, 1906, the failure of\r\nthe government's attempt to capture the body was complete. It was\r\noverwhelmingly a progressive parliament that had been elected. The\r\nConstitutional Democrats, upon a radical program, had elected the largest\r\nnumber of members, 178. Next came the representatives of the peasants'\r\norganizations, with a program of moderate Socialism, numbering 116. This\r\ngroup became known in the Duma as the Labor Group. A third group consisted\r\nof 63 representatives of border provinces, mostly advanced Liberals, called\r\nAutonomists, on account of their special interest in questions concerning\r\nlocal autonomy. There were only 28 avowed supporters of the government.\r\nFinally, despite the Socialist boycott of the elections, there were almost\r\nas many Socialists elected as there were supporters of the government.\r\n\r\nOnce more Russia had spoken for democracy in no uncertain voice. And once\r\nmore Czarism committed the incredible folly of attempting to stem the tide\r\nof democracy by erecting further measures of autocracy as a dam. Shortly\r\nbefore the time came for the assembling of the newly elected Duma, the\r\nCzar's government announced new fundamental laws which limited the powers\r\nof the Duma and practically reduced it to a farce. In the first place, the\r\nImperial Council was to be reconstituted and set over the Duma as an upper\r\nchamber, or Senate, having equal rights with the Duma. Half of the members\r\nof the Imperial Council were to be appointed by the Czar and the other half\r\nelected from universities, zemstvos, bourses, and by the clergy and the\r\nnobility. In other words, over the Duma was to be set a body which could\r\nalways be so manipulated as to insure the defeat of any measure displeasing\r\nto the old régime. And the Czar reserved to himself the power to summon or\r\ndissolve the Duma at will, as well as the power to declare war and to make\r\npeace and to enter into treaties with other nations. What a farce was this\r\nconsidered as a fulfilment of the solemn assurances given in October, 1905!\r\n\r\nBut the reactionary madness went even farther; believing the revolutionary\r\nmovement to have been crushed to such a degree that it might act with\r\nimpunity, autocracy took other measures. Three days before the assembling\r\nof the Duma the Czar replaced his old Ministry by one still more\r\nreactionary. At the head of the Cabinet, as Prime Minister, he appointed\r\nthe notorious reactionary bureaucrat, Goremykin. With full regard for the\r\nbloody traditions of the office, the infamous Stolypin, former Governor of\r\nSaratov, was made Minister of the Interior. At the head of the Department\r\nof Agriculture, which was charged with responsibility for dealing with\r\nagrarian problems, was placed Stishinsky, a large landowner, bitterly\r\nhostile to, and hated by, the peasants. The composition of the new Ministry\r\nwas a defiance of the popular will and sentiment, and was so interpreted.\r\n\r\nThe Duma opened on April 27th, at the Taurida Palace. St. Petersburg was a\r\nvast armed camp that day. Tens of thousands of soldiers, fully armed, were\r\nmassed at different points in readiness to suppress any demonstrations by\r\nthe populace. It was said that provocateurs moved among the people, trying\r\nto stir an uprising which would afford a pretext for action by the\r\nsoldiers. The members of the Duma were first received by the Czar at the\r\nWinter Palace and addressed by him in a pompous speech which carefully\r\navoided all the vital questions in which the Russian people were so keenly\r\ninterested. It was a speech which might as well have been made by the first\r\nCzar Nicholas. But there was no need of words to tell what was in the mind\r\nof Nicholas II; that had been made quite evident by the new laws and the\r\nnew Ministry. Before the Duma lay the heavy task of continuing the\r\nRevolution, despite the fact that the revolutionary army had been scattered\r\nas chaff is scattered before the winds.\r\n\r\nThe first formal act of the Duma, after the opening ceremonies were\r\nfinished, was to demand amnesty for all the political prisoners. The\r\nmembers of the Duma had come to the Taurida Palace that day through streets\r\ncrowded with people who chanted in monotonous chorus the word \"Amnesty.\"\r\nThe oldest man in the assembly, I.I. Petrunkevitch, was cheered again and\r\nagain as he voiced the popular demand on behalf of \"those who have\r\nsacrificed their freedom to free our dear fatherland.\" There were some\r\nseventy-five thousand political prisoners in Russia at that time, the\r\nflower of Russian manhood and womanhood, treated as common criminals and,\r\nin many instances, subject to terrible torture. Well might Petrunkevitch\r\nproclaim: \"All the prisons of our country are full. Thousands of hands are\r\nbeing stretched out to us in hope and supplication, and I think that the\r\nduty of our conscience compels us to use all the influence our position\r\ngives us to see that the freedom that Russia has won costs no more\r\nsacrifices ... I think, gentlemen ... we cannot refrain just now from\r\nexpressing our deepest feelings, the cry of our heart--that free Russia\r\ndemands the liberation of all prisoners.\" At the end of the eloquent appeal\r\nthere was an answering cry of: \"Amnesty!\" \"Amnesty!\" The chorus of the\r\nstreets was echoed in the Duma itself.\r\n\r\nThere was no lack of courage in the Duma. One of its first acts was the\r\nadoption of an address in response to the speech delivered by the Czar to\r\nthe members at the reception at the Winter Palace. The address was in\r\nreality a statement of the objects and needs of the Russian people, their\r\nprogram. It was a radical document, but moderately couched. It demanded\r\nfull political freedom; amnesty for all who had been imprisoned for\r\npolitical reasons or for violations of laws in restriction of religious\r\nliberty; the abolition of martial law and other extraordinary measures;\r\nabolition of capital punishment; the abolition of the Imperial Council and\r\ndemocratization of the laws governing elections to the Duma; autonomy for\r\nFinland and Poland; the expropriation of state and private lands in the\r\ninterest of the peasants; a comprehensive body of social legislation\r\ndesigned to protect the industrial workers. In a word, the program of the\r\nDuma was a broad and comprehensive program of political and social\r\ndemocracy, which, if enacted, would have placed Russia among the foremost\r\ndemocracies of the world.\r\n\r\nThe boldness of the Duma program was a direct challenge to the government\r\nand was so interpreted by the Czar and his Ministers. By the reactionary\r\npress it was denounced as a conspiracy to hand the nation over to the\r\nSocialists. That it should have passed the Duma almost unanimously was an\r\nindication of the extent to which the liberal bourgeoisie represented by\r\nthe Constitutional Democrats was prepared to go in order to destroy\r\nautocracy. No wonder that some of the most trusted Marxian Socialists in\r\nRussia were urging that it was the duty of the Socialists to co-operate\r\nwith the Duma! Yet there was a section of the Marxists engaged in a\r\nconstant agitation against the Duma, preaching the doctrine of the class\r\nstruggle, but blind to the actual fact that the dominant issue was in the\r\nconflict between the democracy of the Duma and the autocracy of Czarism.\r\n\r\nThe class consciousness of the old régime was much clearer and more\r\nintelligent. The Czar refused to receive the committee of the Duma,\r\nappointed to make formal presentation of the address. Then, on May 12th,\r\nGoremykin, the Prime Minister, addressed the Duma, making answer to its\r\ndemands. On behalf of the government he rebuked the Duma for its\r\nunpatriotic conduct in a speech full of studied insult and contemptuous\r\ndefiance. He made it quite clear that the government was not going to grant\r\nany reforms worthy of mention. More than that, he made it plain to the\r\nentire nation that Nicholas II and his bureaucracy would never recognize\r\nthe Duma as an independent parliamentary body. Thus the old régime answered\r\nthe challenge of the Duma.\r\n\r\nFor seventy-two days the Duma worked and fought, seventy-two days of\r\nparliamentary history for which there is no parallel in the annals of\r\nparliamentary government. For the sake of the larger aims before it, the\r\nDuma carried out the demands of the government that it approve certain\r\npetty measures placed before it for the formality of its approval. On the\r\nother hand, it formulated and passed numerous measures upon its own\r\ninitiative and demanded that they be recognized as laws of the land. Among\r\nthe measures thus adopted were laws guaranteeing freedom of assemblage;\r\nequality of all citizens before the law; the right of labor organizations\r\nto exist and to conduct strikes; reform of judicial procedure in the\r\ncourts; state aid for peasants suffering from crop failure and other\r\nagrarian reforms; the abolition of capital punishment. In addition to\r\npursuing its legislative program, the Duma members voiced the country's\r\nprotest against the shortcomings of the government, subjecting the various\r\nMinisters to searching interpellation, day after day.\r\n\r\nNot a single one of the measures adopted by the Duma received the support\r\nof the Imperial Council. This body was effectively performing the task for\r\nwhich it had been created. To the interpellations of the Duma the Czar's\r\nMinisters made the most insulting replies, when they happened to take any\r\nnotice of them at all. All the old iniquities were resorted to by the\r\ngovernment, supported, as always, by the reactionary press. The homes of\r\nmembers of the Duma were entered and searched by the police and every\r\nparliamentary right and privilege was flouted. Even the publication of the\r\nspeeches delivered in the Duma was forbidden.\r\n\r\nThe Duma had from the first maintained a vigorous protest against \"the\r\ninfamy of executions without trial, pogroms, bombardment, and\r\nimprisonment.\" Again and again it had been charged that pogroms were\r\ncarried out under the protection of the government, in accordance with the\r\nold policy of killing the Jews and the Intellectuals. The answer of the\r\ngovernment was--another pogrom of merciless savagery. On June 1st, at\r\nByalostock, upward of eighty men, women, and children were killed, many\r\nmore wounded, and scores of women, young and old, brutally outraged. The\r\nDuma promptly sent a commission to Byalostock to investigate and report\r\nupon the facts, and presently the commission made a report which proved\r\nbeyond question the responsibility of the government for the whole brutal\r\nand bloody business. It was shown that the inflammatory manifestos calling\r\nupon the \"loyal\" citizens to make the attack were printed in the office of\r\nthe Police Department; that soldiers in the garrison had been told days in\r\nadvance when the pogrom would take place; and that in the looting and\r\nsacking of houses and shops, which occurred upon a large scale, officers of\r\nthe garrison had participated. These revelations made a profound impression\r\nin Russia and throughout Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe Duma finally brought upon itself the whole weight of Czarism when it\r\naddressed a special appeal to the peasants of the country in which it dealt\r\nwith candor and sincerity with the great agrarian problems which bore upon\r\nthe peasants so heavily. The appeal outlined the various measures which the\r\nDuma had tried to enact for the relief of the peasants, and the attitude of\r\nthe Czar's Ministers. The many strong peasants' organizations, and their\r\nnumerous representatives in the Duma, made the circulation of this appeal\r\nan easy matter. The government could not close these channels of\r\ncommunication, nor prevent the Duma's strong plea for lawful rights and\r\nagainst lawlessness by government officials from reaching the peasants.\r\nOnly one method of defense remained to the Czar and his Ministers: On July\r\n9th, like a thunderbolt from the sky, came a new Manifesto from the Czar,\r\ndissolving the Duma. In the Manifesto all the old arrogance of Absolutism\r\nreappeared. A more striking contrast to the Manifesto of the previous\r\nOctober could not be readily imagined. The Duma was accused of having\r\nexceeded its rights by \"investigating the actions of local authorities\r\nappointed by the Emperor,\" notwithstanding the fact that in the October\r\nManifesto it had been solemnly covenanted \"that the representatives of the\r\npeople must be guaranteed a real participation in the control over the\r\nlawfulness of the authorities appointed by us.\" The Duma was condemned for\r\n\"finding imperfections in the fundamental laws which can be altered only by\r\nthe monarch's will\" and for its \"overtly lawless act of appealing to the\r\npeople.\" The Manifesto charged that the growing unrest and lawlessness of\r\nthe peasants were due to the failure of the Duma to ameliorate their\r\nconditions--and this in spite of the record!\r\n\r\nWhen the members of the Duma arrived at the Taurida Palace next day they\r\nfound the place filled with troops who prevented their entrance. They were\r\npowerless. Some two hundred-odd members adjourned to Viborg, whence they\r\nissued an appeal to the people to defend their rights. These men were not\r\nSocialists, most of them belonging to the party of the Constitutional\r\nDemocrats, but they issued an appeal to the people to meet the dissolution\r\nof the Imperial Duma by a firm refusal to pay taxes, furnish recruits for\r\nthe army, or sanction the legality of any loans to the government. This was\r\npractically identical with the policy set forth in the Manifesto of the\r\nExecutive Committee of the St. Petersburg Council of Workmen's Deputies at\r\nthe beginning of the previous December, before the elections to the Duma.\r\nNow, however, the Socialists in the Duma--both the Social Democrats and the\r\nSocialist-Revolutionists--together with the semi-Socialist Labor Group,\r\ndecided that it was not enough to appeal for passive resistance; that only\r\nan armed uprising could accomplish anything. They therefore appealed to\r\nthe city proletariat, the peasants, the army, and the navy to rise in armed\r\nstrength against the tyrannical régime.\r\n\r\nNeither appeal produced any noteworthy result. The response to the Viborg\r\nappeal was far less than that which followed the similar appeal of the St.\r\nPetersburg workmen in December. The signers of the appeal were arrested,\r\nsentenced to three months' imprisonment, and deprived of their electoral\r\nrights. To the appeal of the Duma Socialists there was likewise very little\r\nresponse, either from city workers, peasants, soldiers, or marines. Russia\r\nwas struggle-weary. The appeals fell upon the ears of a cowed and beaten\r\npopulace. The two documents served only to emphasize one fact, namely, that\r\ncapacity and daring to attempt active and violent resistance was still\r\nlargely confined to the working-class representatives. In appealing to the\r\nworkers to meet the attacks of the government with armed resistance, the\r\nleaders of the peasants and the city proletariat were ready to take their\r\nplaces in the vanguard of the fight. On the other hand, the signers of the\r\nViborg appeal for passive resistance manifested no such determination or\r\ndesire, though they must have known that passive resistance could only be a\r\ntemporary phase, that any concerted action by the people to resist the\r\ncollection of taxes and recruiting for the army would have led to attack\r\nand counter-attack-to a violent revolution.\r\n\r\nFeeling perfectly secure, the government, while promising the election of\r\nanother Duma, carried on a policy of vigorous repression of all radical and\r\nrevolutionary agitation and organization. Executions without trial were\r\nalmost daily commonplaces. Prisoners were mercilessly tortured, and, in\r\nmany cases, flogged to death. Hundreds of persons, of both sexes, many of\r\nthem simple bourgeois-liberals and not revolutionists in any sense of the\r\nword, were exiled to Siberia. The revolutionary organizations of the\r\nworkers were filled with spies and provocateurs, an old and effective\r\nmethod of destroying their morale. In all the provinces of Russia field\r\ncourt martial was proclaimed. Field court martial is more drastic than\r\nordinary court martial and practically amounts to condemnation without\r\ntrial, for trials under it are simply farcical, since neither defense nor\r\nappeal is granted. Nearly five hundred revolutionists were put to death\r\nunder this system, many of them without even the pretense of a trial.\r\n\r\nThe Black Hundreds were more active than ever, goaded on by the Holy Synod.\r\nGoremykin resigned as Premier and his place was taken by the unspeakably\r\ncruel and bloodthirsty Stolypin, whose \"hemp neckties,\" as the grim jest of\r\nthe masses went, circled the necks of scores of revolutionists swinging\r\nfrom as many gallows. There were many resorts to terrorism on the part of\r\nthe revolutionists during the summer of 1906, many officials paying for the\r\ninfamies of the government with their lives. How many of these \"executions\"\r\nwere genuine revolutionary protests, and how many simple murders instigated\r\nor committed by provocative agents for the purpose of discrediting the\r\nrevolutionists and affording the government excuses for fresh infamies,\r\nwill perhaps never be known. Certainly, in many cases, there was no\r\nauthorization by any revolutionary body.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1907, the elections for the Second Duma were held under a\r\nreign of terror. The bureaucracy was determined to have a \"safe and sane\"\r\nbody this time, and resorted to every possible nefarious device to attain\r\nthat end. Whole masses of electors whose right to vote had been established\r\nat the previous election were arbitrarily disfranchised. While every\r\nfacility was given to candidates openly favoring the government, including\r\nthe Octobrists, every possible obstacle was placed in the way of radical\r\ncandidates, especially Socialists. The meetings of the latter were, in\r\nhundreds of cases, prohibited; in other hundreds of cases they were broken\r\nup by the Black Hundreds and the police. Many of the most popular\r\ncandidates were arrested and imprisoned without trial, as were members of\r\ntheir campaign committees. Yet, notwithstanding all these things, the\r\nSecond Duma was, from the standpoint of the government, worse than the\r\nfirst. The Socialists, adopting the tactics of Plechanov, against the\r\nadvice of Lenine, his former pupil and disciple, had decided not to boycott\r\nthe elections this time, but to participate in them. When the returns were\r\npublished it was found that the Social Democrats and the\r\nSocialist-Revolutionists had each elected over sixty deputies, the total\r\nbeing nearly a third of the membership--455. In addition there were some\r\nninety members in the peasants' Labor Group, which were semi-Socialist.\r\nThere were 117 Constitutional Democrats. The government supporters,\r\nincluding the Octobrists, numbered less than one hundred.\r\n\r\nFrom the first the attitude of the government toward the new Duma was one\r\nof contemptuous arrogance. \"The Czar's Hangman,\" Stolypin, lectured the\r\nmembers as though they were naughty children, forbidding them to invite\r\nexperts to aid them in framing measures, or to communicate with any of the\r\nzemstvos or municipal councils upon any questions whatsoever. \"The Duma was\r\nnot granted the right to express disapproval, reproach, or mistrust of the\r\ngovernment,\" he thundered. To the Duma there was left about as much real\r\npower as is enjoyed by the \"governments\" of our \"juvenile republics.\"\r\n\r\nAs a natural consequence of these things, the Second Duma paid less\r\nattention to legislation than the First Duma had done, and gave its time\r\nlargely to interpellations and protests. Partly because of the absence of\r\nsome of the most able leaders they had had in the First Duma, and partly to\r\nthe aggressive radicalism of the Socialists, which they could only\r\nhalf-heartedly approve at best, the Constitutional Democrats were less\r\ninfluential than in the former parliament. They occupied a middle\r\nground--always a difficult position. The real fight was between the\r\nSocialists and the reactionaries, supporters of the government. Among the\r\nlatter were perhaps a score of members belonging to the Black Hundreds,\r\nconstituting the extreme right wing of the reactionary group. Between these\r\nand the Socialists of the extreme left the assembly was kept at fever\r\npitch. The Black Hundreds, for the most part, indulged in violent tirades\r\nof abuse, often in the most disgusting profanity. The Socialists replied\r\nwith proletarian passion and vigor, and riotous scenes were common. The\r\nSecond Duma was hardly a deliberative assembly!\r\n\r\nOn June 1st Stolypin threw a bombshell into the Duma by accusing the Social\r\nDemocrats of having conspired to form a military plot for the overthrow of\r\nthe government of Nicholas II. Evidence to this effect had been furnished\r\nto the Police Department by the spy and provocative agent, Azev. Of course\r\nthere was no secret about the fact that the Social Democrats were always\r\ntrying to bring about revolt in the army and the navy. They had openly\r\nproclaimed this, time and again. In the appeal issued at the time of the\r\ndissolution of the First Duma they had called upon the army and navy to\r\nrise in armed revolt. But the betrayal of their plans was a matter of some\r\nconsequence. Azev himself had been loudest and most persistent in urging\r\nthe work on. Stolypin demanded that all the Social Democrats be excluded\r\npermanently from the Duma and that sixteen of them be handed over to the\r\ngovernment for imprisonment. The demand was a challenge to the whole Duma,\r\nsince it called into question the right of the Duma to determine its own\r\nmembership. Obviously, if members of parliament are to be dismissed\r\nwhenever an autocratic government orders it, there is an end of\r\nparliamentary government. The demand created a tremendous sensation and\r\ngave rise to a long and exciting debate. Before it was ended, however,\r\nNicholas II ordered the Duma dissolved. On June 3d the Second Duma met the\r\nfate of its predecessor, having lasted one hundred days.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nAs on the former occasion, arrangements were at once begun to bring about\r\nthe election of another and more subservient Duma. It is significant that\r\nthroughout Nicholas II and his Cabinet recognized the imperative necessity\r\nof maintaining the institution in form. They dared not abolish it, greatly\r\nas they would have liked to do so. On the day that the Duma was dissolved\r\nthe Czar, asserting his divine right to enact and repeal laws at will,\r\ndisregarding again the solemn assurances of the October Manifesto, by edict\r\nchanged the electoral laws, consulting neither the Duma nor the Imperial\r\nCouncil. This new law greatly decreased the representation of the city\r\nworkers and the peasants in the Duma and correspondingly increased the\r\nrepresentation of the rich landowners and capitalists. A docile and \"loyal\"\r\nDuma was thus made certain, and no one was very much surprised when the\r\nelections, held in September, resulted in an immense reactionary majority.\r\nWhen the Third Duma met on December 14, 1907, the reactionaries were as\r\nstrong as the Socialist and Labor groups had been in the previous Duma,\r\nand of the reactionaries the group of members of the Black Hundreds was a\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time there had been the familiar rule of brutal reaction. Most\r\nof the Social Democratic members of the Second Duma were arrested and\r\ncondemned for high treason, being sent to prison and to Siberia. New laws\r\nand regulations restricting the press were proclaimed and enforced with\r\nincreasing severity. By comparison with the next two years, the period from\r\n1905 to 1907 was a period of freedom. After the election of the Third Duma\r\nthe bureaucracy grew ever bolder. Books and leaflets which had been\r\ncirculated openly and with perfect freedom during 1905 and 1906 were\r\nforbidden, and, moreover, their authors were arrested and sentenced to long\r\nterms of imprisonment. While the law still granted freedom of assemblage\r\nand the right to organize meetings, these rights did not exist as\r\nrealities. Everywhere the Black Hundreds held sway, patronized by the Czar,\r\nwho wore their emblem and refused to permit the punishment of any of their\r\nmembers, even though they might be found guilty by the courts.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to dwell upon the work of the Third Duma. This is not a\r\nhistory of Russia, and a detailed study of the servile parliament of\r\nNicholas II and Stolypin would take us too far afield from our special\r\nstudy--the revolutionary movement. Suffice it, therefore, to say that some\r\nvery useful legislation, necessary to the economic development of Russia,\r\nwas enacted, and that, despite the overwhelming preponderance of\r\nreactionaries, it was not an absolutely docile body. On several occasions\r\nthe Third Duma exercised the right of criticism quite vigorously, and on\r\ntwo or three occasions acted in more or less open defiance of the wishes of\r\nthe government. A notable instance of this was the legislation of 1909,\r\nconsiderably extending freedom of religious organization and worship, which\r\nwas, however, greatly curtailed later by the Imperial Council--and then\r\nnullified by the government.\r\n\r\nThe period 1906-14 was full of despair for sensitive and aspiring souls.\r\nThe steady and rapid rise in the suicide-rate bore grim and eloquent\r\ntestimony to the character of those years of dark repression. The number of\r\nsuicides in St. Petersburg increased during the period 1905-08 more than\r\n400 per cent.; in Moscow about 800 per cent.! In the latter city two-fifths\r\nof the suicides in 1908 were of persons less than twenty years old! And\r\nyet, withal, there was room for hope, the soul of progress was not dead. In\r\nvarious directions there was a hopeful and promising growth. First among\r\nthese hopeful and promising facts was the marvelous growth of the\r\nConsumers' Co-operatives. After 1905 began the astonishing increase in the\r\nnumber of these important organizations, which continued, year after year,\r\nright up to the Revolution of 1917. In 1905 there were 4,479 such\r\nco-operatives in Russia; in 1911 there were 19,253. Another hopeful sign\r\nwas the steadily increasing literacy of the masses. Statistics upon this\r\npoint are almost worthless. Russian official statistics are notoriously\r\ndefective and the figures relating to literacy are peculiarly so, but the\r\nleaders of Russian Socialism have attested to the fact. In this connection\r\nit is worthy of note that, according to the most authentic official\r\nrecords, the number of persons subscribing to the public press grew in a\r\nsingle year, from 1908 to 1909, fully 25 per cent. Education and\r\norganization were going on, hand in hand.\r\n\r\nNor was agitation dead. In the Duma the Socialist and Labor parties and\r\ngroups, knowing that they had no chance to enact their program, made the\r\nDuma a rostrum from which to address the masses throughout the nation.\r\nSometimes, indeed, the newspapers were forbidden to print their speeches,\r\nbut as a rule they were published, at least by the liberal papers, and so\r\ndisseminated among the masses. In these speeches the Social Democrats,\r\nSocialist-Revolutionaries, Laborites, and more daring of the Constitutional\r\nDemocrats mercilessly exposed the bureaucracy, so keeping the fires of\r\ndiscontent alive.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nOf vast significance to mankind was the controversy that was being waged\r\nwithin the Socialist movement of Russia during these years, for this was\r\nthe period in which Bolshevism was shaping itself and becoming articulate.\r\nThe words \"Bolsheviki\" and \"Bolshevism\" first made their appearance in\r\n1903, but it was not until 1905 that they began to acquire their present\r\nmeaning. At the second convention of the Social Democratic party, held in\r\n1903, the party split in two factions. The majority faction, headed by\r\nLenine, adopted the name Bolsheviki, a word derived from the Russian word\r\n\"bolshinstvo,\" meaning \"majority.\" The minority faction, which followed\r\nPlechanov, though he did not formally join it, was called, in\r\ncontradistinction, the \"Mensheviki\"--that is, the minority. No question of\r\nprinciple was involved in the split, the question at issue being simply\r\nwhether there should be more or less centralization in the organization.\r\nThere was no thought on either side of leaving the Social Democratic party.\r\nIt was simply a factional division in the party itself and did not prevent\r\nloyal co-operation. Both the Bolsheviki and the Mensheviki remained Social\r\nDemocrats--that is, Socialists of the school of Marx.\r\n\r\nDuring the revolutionary struggle of 1905-06 the breach between the two\r\nfactions was greatly widened. The two groups held utterly irreconcilable\r\nconceptions of Socialist policy, if not of Socialism as an ideal. The\r\npsychology of the two groups was radically different. By this time the\r\nLenine faction was no longer the majority, being, in fact, a rather small\r\nminority in the party. The Plechanov faction was greatly in the majority.\r\nBut the old names continued to be used. Although a minority, the Lenine\r\nfaction was still called the Bolsheviki, and the Plechanov faction called\r\nthe Mensheviki, despite the fact that it was the majority. Thus Bolshevism\r\nno longer connoted the principles and tactics of the majority. It came to\r\nbe used interchangeably with Leninism, as a synonym. The followers of\r\nVladimir Ulyanov continued to regard themselves as part of the Social\r\nDemocratic party, its radical left wing, and it was not until after the\r\nSecond Revolution, in 1917, that they manifested any desire to be\r\ndifferentiated from the Social Democrats.\r\n\r\nVladimir Ulyanov was born in 1870, at Simbirsk, in central Russia. There is\r\nno mystery about his use of the alias, Nikolai Lenine, which he has made\r\nworld-famous and by which he chooses to be known. Almost every Russian\r\nrevolutionist has had to adopt various aliases for self-protection and for\r\nthe protection of other Russian Socialists. Ulyanov has followed the rule\r\nand lived and worked under several aliases, and his writings under the name\r\n\"Nikolai Lenine\" made him a great power in the Russian Socialist movement.\r\n\r\nLenine's father was a governmental official employed in the Department of\r\nPublic Instruction. It is one of the many anomalies of the life of the\r\nRussian Dictator that he himself belongs by birth, training, culture, and\r\nexperience to the bourgeoisie against which he fulminates so furiously.\r\nEven his habits and tastes are of bourgeois and not proletarian origin. He\r\nis an Intellectual of the Intellectuals and has never had the slightest\r\nproletarian experience. As a youth still in his teens he entered the\r\nUniversity of St. Petersburg, but his stay there was exceedingly brief,\r\nowing to a tragedy which greatly embittered his life and gave it its\r\ndirection. An older brother, who was also a student in the university, was\r\ncondemned to death, in a secret trial, for complicity in a terrorist plot\r\nto assassinate Alexander III. Shortly afterward he was put to death. Lenine\r\nhimself was arrested at the same time as his brother, but released for lack\r\nof evidence connecting him with the affair. It is said, however, that the\r\narrest caused his expulsion from the university. Lenine was not the only\r\nyoung man to be profoundly impressed by the execution of the youthful\r\nAlexander Ulyanov; another student, destined to play an important rôle in\r\nthe great tragedy of revolutionary Russia, was stirred to bitter hatred of\r\nthe system. That young student was Alexander Kerensky, whose father and the\r\nfather of the Ulyanovs were close friends.\r\n\r\nLenine's activities brought him into conflict with the authorities several\r\ntimes and forced him to spend a good deal of time in exile. As a youth of\r\nseventeen, at the time of the execution of his brother, he was dismissed\r\nfrom the Law School in St. Petersburg. A few years later he was sent to\r\nSiberia for a political \"crime.\" Upon various occasions later he was\r\ncompelled to flee from the country, living sometimes in Paris, sometimes in\r\nLondon, but more often in Switzerland. It was through his writings mainly\r\nthat he acquired the influence he had in the Russian movement. There is\r\nnothing unusual or remarkable about this, for the Social Democratic party\r\nof Russia was practically directed from Geneva. Lenine was in London when\r\nthe Revolution of 1905 broke out and caused him to hurry to St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nAs a young man Lenine, like most of the Intelligentsia of the period, gave\r\nup a good deal of his spare time to teaching small groups of uneducated\r\nworking-men the somewhat abstract and intricate theories and doctrines of\r\nSocialism. To that excellent practice, no doubt, much of Lenine's skill as\r\na lucid expositor and successful propagandist is due. He has written a\r\nnumber of important works, most of them being of a polemical nature and\r\ndealing with party disputations upon questions of theory and tactics. The\r\nwork by which he was best known in Socialist circles prior to his\r\nsensational rise to the Premiership is a treatise on _The Development of\r\nCapitalism in Russia_. This work made its appearance in 1899, when the\r\nMarxian Socialist movement was still very weak. In it Lenine defended the\r\nposition of the Marxians, Plechanov and his group, that Russia was not an\r\nexception to the general law of capitalist development, as was claimed by\r\nthe leaders of the People's party, the _Narodniki_. The book gave Lenine an\r\nassured position among the intellectual leaders of the movement, and was\r\nregarded as a conclusive defense of the position of the Plechanov group, to\r\nwhich Lenine belonged. Since his overthrow of the Kerensky régime, and his\r\nattempt to establish a new kind of social state in Russia, Lenine has been\r\nfrequently confronted by his own earlier reasoning by those who believe his\r\nposition to be contrary to the true Marxian position.\r\n\r\nFrom 1903 to 1906 Lenine's views developed farther and farther away from\r\nthose of his great teacher, George Plechanov. His position in the period of\r\nthe First Duma can best be stated, perhaps, in opposition to the position\r\nof Plechanov and the Mensheviki. Accepting the Marxian theory of historical\r\ndevelopment, Plechanov and his followers believed that Russia must pass\r\nthrough a phase of capitalist development before there could be a\r\nsocial--as distinguished from a merely political--revolution. Certainly\r\nthey believed, an intensive development of industry, bringing into\r\nexistence a strong capitalist class, on the one hand, and a strong\r\nproletariat, on the other hand, must precede any attempt to create a Social\r\nDemocratic state. They believed, furthermore, that a political revolution,\r\ncreating a democratic constitutional system of government, must come before\r\nthe social revolution could be achieved. They accepted the traditional\r\nMarxian view that the achievement of this political revolution must be\r\nmainly the task of the bourgeoisie, and that the proletariat, and\r\nespecially the Socialists, should co-operate with the enlightened\r\nbourgeoisie in attaining that political revolution without which there\r\ncould never be a Socialist commonwealth.\r\n\r\nPlechanov was not blind to the dangers of compromise which must be faced in\r\nbasing the policy of a movement of the masses upon this reasoning. He\r\nargued, however, that there was no choice in the matter at all; that the\r\niron law of historical inevitability and necessity determined the matter.\r\nHe pointed out that the bourgeoisie, represented by the Constitutional\r\nDemocrats in the political struggle, were compelled to wage relentless war\r\nupon Absolutism, the abolition of which was as absolutely essential to the\r\nrealization of their class aims as it was to the realization of the class\r\naims of the proletariat. Hence, in this struggle, the capitalist class, as\r\nyet too weak to accomplish the overthrow of autocracy and Czarism, and the\r\nproletariat, equally dependent for success upon the overthrow of autocracy\r\nand Czarism, and equally too weak to accomplish it unaided, had to face the\r\nfact that historical development had given the two classes which were\r\ndestined to wage a long conflict an immediate unity of interest. Their\r\nimperative needs at the moment were not conflicting needs, but identical\r\nones. To divide their forces, to refuse to co-operate with each other, was\r\nto play the game of the Czar and his associates, argued Plechanov.\r\n\r\nThe Mensheviki favored participation in the Duma elections and co-operation\r\nwith the liberal and radical bourgeoisie parties, in so far as might be\r\nnecessary to overthrow the autocracy, and without sacrificing Socialist\r\nprinciples. They pointed out that this position was evidently feared by the\r\nbureaucracy far more than the position of the extremists among the Social\r\nDemocrats and the Socialist-Revolutionists, who refused to consider such\r\nco-operation, and pointed to the fact that provocateurs in large numbers\r\nassociated themselves with the latter in their organizations and preached\r\nthe same doctrine of absolute isolation and exclusiveness.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the position of the Mensheviki was one of practical\r\npolitical opportunism, an opportunism, however, that must be sharply\r\ndistinguished from what Wilhelm Liebknecht used to call \"political\r\ncow-trading.\" No man in the whole history of international Socialism ever\r\nmore thoroughly despised this species of political opportunism than George\r\nPlechanov. To those who are familiar with the literature of international\r\nSocialism it will be unnecessary to say that Plechanov was not the man to\r\ndeprecate the importance of sound theory as a guide to the formulation of\r\nparty policies. For many years he was rightly regarded as one of the\r\ngreatest theoreticians of the movement. Certainly there was only one other\r\nwriter in the whole international movement who could be named as having an\r\nequal title to be considered the greatest Socialist theorist since\r\nMarx--Karl Kautsky.\r\n\r\nBut Plechanov[1]--like Marx himself--set reality above dogma, and regarded\r\nmovement as of infinitely greater importance than theory. The Mensheviki\r\nwanted to convene a great mass convention of representatives of the\r\nindustrial proletariat during the summer of 1906. \"It is a class movement,\"\r\nthey said, \"not a little sectarian movement. How can there be a _class_\r\nmovement unless the way is open to all the working class to participate?\"\r\nAccordingly, they wanted a convention to which all the factory-workers\r\nwould be invited to send representatives. There should be no doctrinal\r\ntests, the sole qualification being membership in the working class. It did\r\nnot matter to the advocates of this policy whether a man belonged to the\r\nSocial Democratic party or to any party; whether he called himself a\r\nrevolutionist or anything else. It was, they said, a movement of the\r\nworking class, not the movement of a sect within the working class.\r\n\r\nThey knew, of course, that in such a great mass movement there would\r\nprobably be some theoretical confusion, more or less muddled thinking. They\r\nrecognized, too, that in the great mass convention they proposed some\r\nSocial Democratic formulations might be rejected and some others adopted\r\nwhich did not accord with the Marxian doctrines. But, quoting Marx to the\r\neffect that \"One step of real movement is worth a thousand programs,\" they\r\ncontended that if there was anything at all in the Marxian theory of\r\nprogress through class struggles, and the historic rule of the working\r\nclass, it must follow that, while they might make mistakes and go\r\ntemporarily astray, the workers could not go far wrong, their class\r\ninterests being a surer guide than any amount of intellectualism could\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\nLenine and his friends, the Bolsheviki, bitterly opposed all this reasoning\r\nand took a diametrically opposite position upon every one of the questions\r\ninvolved. They absolutely opposed any sort of co-operation with bourgeois\r\nparties of any kind, for any purpose whatever. No matter how progressive a\r\nparticular bourgeois party might be, nor how important the reform aimed at,\r\nthey believed that Social Democrats should remain in \"splendid isolation,\"\r\nrefusing to make any distinction between more liberal and less liberal,\r\nprogressive and reactionary, groups in the bourgeoisie. Trotzky, who did\r\nnot at first formally join the Bolsheviki, but was a true Bolshevik in his\r\nintellectual convictions and sympathies, fully shared this view.\r\n\r\nNow, Lenine and Trotzky were dogmatic Marxists, and as such they could not\r\ndeny the contention that capitalism must attain a certain development\r\nbefore Socialism could be attained in Russia. Nor could they deny that\r\nAbsolutism was an obstacle to the development both of capitalist industry\r\nand of Socialism. They contended, however, that the peculiar conditions in\r\nRussia, resulting from the retardation of her economic development for so\r\nlong, made it both possible and necessary to create a revolutionary\r\nmovement which would, at one and the same time, overthrow both autocracy\r\nand capitalism. Necessarily, therefore, their warfare must be directed\r\nequally against autocracy and all political parties of the landlord and\r\ncapitalist classes. They were guided throughout by this fundamental\r\nconviction. The policy of absolute and unqualified isolation in the Duma,\r\nwhich they insisted the Social Democrats ought to pursue, was based upon\r\nthat conviction.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nAll this is quite clear and easily intelligible. Granted the premise, the\r\nlogic is admirable. It is not so easy, however, to see why, even granting\r\nthe soundness of their opposition to _co-operation_ with bourgeois parties\r\nand groups in the Duma, there should be no political _competition_ with\r\nthem--which would seem to be logically implied in the boycott of the Duma\r\nelections. Non-participation in the elections, consistently pursued as a\r\nproletarian policy, would leave the proletariat unrepresented in the\r\nlegislative body, without one representative to fight its battles on what\r\nthe world universally regards as one of the most important battle-fields of\r\ncivilization. And yet, here, too, they were entirely logical and\r\nconsistent--they did not believe in parliamentary government. As yet, they\r\nwere not disposed to emphasize this overmuch, not, apparently, because of\r\nany lack of candor and good faith, but rather because the substitute for\r\nparliamentary government had not sufficiently shaped itself in their minds.\r\nThe desire not to be confused with the Anarchists was another reason.\r\nBecause the Bolsheviki and the Anarchists both oppose parliamentary\r\ngovernment and the political state, it has been concluded by many writers\r\non the subject that Bolshevism is simply Anarchism in another guise. This\r\nis a mistake. Bolshevism is quite different from and opposed to Anarchism.\r\nIt requires strongly centralized government, which Anarchism abhors.\r\n\r\nParliamentary government cannot exist except upon the basis of the will of\r\nthe majority. Whoever enters into the parliamentary struggle, therefore,\r\nmust hope and aim to convert the majority. Back of that hope and aim must\r\nbe faith in the intellectual and moral capacity of the majority. At the\r\nfoundation of Bolshevist theory and practice lies the important fact that\r\nthere is no such faith, and, consequently, neither the hope nor the aim to\r\nconvert the majority and with its strength make the Revolution. Out of the\r\nadult population of Russia at that time approximately 85 per cent. were\r\npeasants and less than 5 per cent. belonged to the industrial proletariat.\r\nAt that time something like 70 per cent. of the people were illiterate.\r\nEven in St. Petersburg--where the standard of literacy was higher than in\r\nany other city--not more than 55 per cent. of the people could sign their\r\nown names in 1905, according to the most authentic government reports. When\r\nwe contemplate such facts as these can we wonder that impatient\r\nrevolutionaries should shrink from attempting the task of converting a\r\nmajority of the population to an intelligent acceptance of Socialism?\r\n\r\nThere was another reason besides this, however. Lenine--and he personifies\r\nBolshevism--was, and is, a doctrinaire Marxist of the most dogmatic type\r\nconceivable. As such he believed that the new social order must be the\r\ncreation of that class which is the peculiar product of modern capitalism,\r\nthe industrial proletariat. To that class alone he and his followers pinned\r\nall their faith and hope, and that class was a small minority of the\r\npopulation and bound to remain a minority for a very long period of years.\r\nHere, then, we have the key. It cannot be too strongly stressed that the\r\nBolsheviki did not base their hope upon the working class of Russia, and\r\ndid not trust it. The working class of Russia--if we are to use the term\r\nwith an intelligent regard to realities--was and is mainly composed of\r\npeasants; the industrial proletariat was and is only a relatively small\r\npart of the great working class of the nation. _But it is upon that small\r\nsection, as against the rest of the working class, that Bolshevism relies_.\r\n\r\nLenine has always refused to include the peasants in his definition of the\r\nworking class. With almost fanatical intensity he has insisted that the\r\npeasant, together with the petty manufacturer and trader, would soon\r\ndisappear; that industrial concentration would have its counterpart in a\r\ngreat concentration of landownings and agriculture; that the small peasant\r\nholdings would be swallowed up by large, modern agricultural estates, with\r\nthe result that there would be an immense mass of landless agricultural\r\nwage-workers. This class would, of course, be a genuinely proletarian\r\nclass, and its interests would be identical with those of the industrial\r\nproletariat. Until that time came it would be dangerous to rely upon the\r\npeasants, he urged, because their instincts are bourgeois rather than\r\nproletarian. Naturally, he has looked askance at the peasant Socialist\r\nmovements, denying that they were truly Socialist at all. They could not be\r\nSocialist movements in the true sense, he contended, because they lacked\r\nthe essential quality of true Socialists, namely, proletarian class\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\nNaturally, too, Lenine and his followers have always regarded movements\r\nwhich aimed to divide the land among the peasants, and so tend to give\r\npermanence to a class of petty agriculturists, as essentially reactionary.\r\nThe exigencies of the struggle have forced them into some compromises, of\r\ncourse. For example, at first they were not willing to admit that the\r\npeasants could be admitted into their group at all, but later on they\r\nadmitted some who belonged to the poorest class of peasants. Throughout,\r\nhowever, they have insisted that the peasant class as a whole was a class\r\nof petty bourgeoisie and that its instincts and interests would inevitably\r\nlead it to side with the bourgeoisie as against the proletariat. Of course,\r\nthis is a very familiar phase of Socialist evolution in every country. It\r\nlasted in Germany many years. In Russia, however, the question assumed an\r\nimportance it never had in any other country, owing to the vast\r\npreponderance of peasants in the population. Anything more un-Russian than\r\nthis theorizing cannot be well conceived. It runs counter to every fact in\r\nRussian experience, to the very basis of her economic life at this stage of\r\nher history. Lenine is a Russian, but his dogmas are not Russian, but\r\nGerman. Bolshevism is the product of perverted German scholasticism.\r\n\r\nEven the industrial workers as a whole, in their present stage of\r\ndevelopment, were not to be trusted, according to the Bolshevist leaders.\r\nThey frankly opposed the Mensheviki when the latter proposed to hold their\r\ngreat convention of industrial workers, giving as their reason the fear\r\nthat the convention majority would not consist of class-conscious\r\nrevolutionary Marxian Socialists. In other words, they feared that the\r\nmajority would not be on their side, and they had not the time or the\r\npatience to convert them. There was no pretense of faith in the majority of\r\nthe industrial proletariat, much less of faith in the entire working class\r\nof Russia. The industrial proletariat was a minority of the working class,\r\nand the Bolsheviki pinned their faith to a minority of that minority. They\r\nwanted to establish, not democracy, but dictatorship of Russia by a small,\r\ndisciplined, intelligent, and determined minority of working-men.\r\n\r\nThe lines of cleavage between the Mensheviki and the Bolsheviki were thus\r\nclearly drawn. The former, while ready to join in mass uprisings and armed\r\ninsurrections by the masses, believed that the supreme necessity was\r\neducation and organization of all the working-people. Still relying upon\r\nthe industrial proletariat to lead the struggle, they nevertheless\r\nrecognized that the peasants were indispensable. The Bolsheviki, on the\r\nother hand, relied exclusively upon armed insurrection, initiated and\r\ndirected by desperate minorities. The Mensheviki contended that the time\r\nfor secret, conspiratory action was past; that Russia had outgrown that\r\nearlier method. As far as possible, they carried the struggle openly into\r\nthe political field. They organized unions, educational societies, and\r\nco-operatives, confident that through these agencies the workers would\r\ndevelop cohesion and strength, which, at the right time, they would use as\r\ntheir class interests dictated. The Bolsheviki, on the other hand, clung to\r\nthe old conspiratory methods, always mastered by the idea that a sudden\r\n_coup_ must some day place the reins of power in the hands of a\r\nrevolutionary minority of the workers and enable them to set up a\r\ndictatorship. That dictatorship, it must be understood, was not to be\r\npermanent; democracy, possibly even political democracy, would come later.\r\n\r\nAs we have already noted, into the ranks of the terrorist\r\nSocialist-Revolutionaries and the Bolsheviki spies and provocative agents\r\nwormed their way in large numbers. It is the inevitable fate of secret,\r\nconspiratory movements that this should be so, and also that it should\r\nresult in saturating the minds of all engaged in the movements with\r\ndistrust and suspicion. More than once the charge of being a provocateur\r\nwas leveled at Lenine and at Trotzky, but without justification,\r\napparently. There was, indeed, one incident which placed Lenine in a bad\r\nlight. It belongs to a somewhat later period than we have been discussing,\r\nbut it serves admirably to illustrate conditions which obtained throughout\r\nthe whole dark period between the two great revolutions. One of Lenine's\r\nclose friends and disciples was Roman Malinovsky, a fiery speaker of\r\nconsiderable power, distinguished for his bitter attacks upon the bourgeois\r\nprogressive parties and upon the Mensheviki. The tenor of his speeches was\r\nalways the same--only the interest of the proletariat should be considered;\r\nall bourgeois political parties and groups were equally reactionary, and\r\nany co-operation with them, for any purpose, was a betrayal of Socialist\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nMalinovsky was trusted by the Bolsheviki. He was elected to the Fourth\r\nDuma, where he became the leader of the little group of thirteen Social\r\nDemocrats. Like other members of the Bolshevik faction, he entered the\r\nDuma, despite his contempt for parliamentary action, simply because it\r\nafforded him a useful opportunity for agitation and demonstrations. In the\r\nDuma he assailed even a portion of the Social Democratic group as belonging\r\nto the bourgeoisie, succeeding in splitting it in two factions and becoming\r\nthe leader of the Bolshevik faction, numbering six. This blatant demagogue,\r\nwhom Lenine called \"the Russian Bebel,\" was proposed for membership in the\r\nInternational Socialist Bureau, the supreme council of the International\r\nSocialist movement, and would have been sent as a delegate to that body as\r\na representative of Russian Socialist movement but for the discovery of the\r\nfact that he was a secret agent of the Czar's government!\r\n\r\nIt was proved that Malinovsky was a provocateur in the pay of the Police\r\nDepartment, and that many, if not all, of his speeches had been prepared\r\nfor him in the Police Department by a former director named Beletzky. The\r\nexposure made a great sensation in Russian Socialist circles at the time,\r\nand the fact that it was Nikolai Lenine who had proposed that Malinovsky be\r\nchosen to sit in the International Socialist Bureau naturally caused a\r\ngreat deal of unfriendly comment. It cannot be denied that the incident\r\nplaced Lenine in an unfavorable light, but it must be admitted that\r\nnothing developed to suggest that he was guilty of anything more serious\r\nthan permitting himself to be outwitted and deceived by a cunning\r\ntrickster. The incident serves to show, however, the ease with which the\r\nextreme fanaticism of the Bolsheviki played into the hands of the\r\nautocracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nWhile Bolsheviki and Mensheviki wrangled and disputed, great forces were at\r\nwork among the Russian people. By 1910 the terrible pall of depression and\r\ndespair which had settled upon the nation as a result of the failure of the\r\nFirst Revolution began to break. There was a new generation of college\r\nstudents, youthful and optimistic spirits who were undeterred by the\r\nfailure of 1905-06, confident that they were wiser and certain to succeed.\r\nAlso there had been an enormous growth of working-class organizations,\r\nlarge numbers of unions and co-operative societies having been formed in\r\nspite of the efforts of the government. The soul of Russia was once more\r\nstirring.\r\n\r\nThe end of 1910 and the beginning of 1911 witnessed a new series of\r\nstrikes, such as had not occurred since 1905. The first were students'\r\nstrikes, inaugurated in support of their demand for the abolition of\r\ncapital punishment. These were quickly followed by important strikes in the\r\nindustrial centers for economic ends--better wages and shorter\r\nworking-hours. As in the period immediately preceding the First Revolution,\r\nthe industrial unrest soon manifested itself in political ways. Without any\r\nconscious leadership at all this would have been inevitable in the existing\r\ncircumstances. But there was leadership. Social Democrats of both factions,\r\nand Socialists of other groups as well, moved among the workers, preaching\r\nthe old, yet ever new, gospel of revolt. Political strikes followed the\r\nstrikes for immediate economic ends. Throughout the latter part of 1911 and\r\nthe whole of 1912 the revolutionary movement once more spread among the\r\nmasses.\r\n\r\nThe year 1913 was hardly well begun when revolutionary activities assumed\r\nformidable proportions. January 9th--Russian calendar--anniversary of\r\nBloody Sunday, was celebrated all over the country by great demonstrations\r\nwhich were really demonstration-strikes. In St. Petersburg fifty-five\r\nthousand workers went out--and there were literally hundreds of other\r\nsmaller \"strikes\" of a similar nature throughout the country. In April\r\nanother anniversary of the martyrdom of revolting working-men was similarly\r\ncelebrated in most of the industrial centers, hundreds of thousands of\r\nworkers striking as a manifestation against the government. The 1st of May\r\nwas celebrated as it had not been celebrated since 1905. In the various\r\nindustrial cities hundreds of thousands of workmen left their work to march\r\nthrough the streets and hold mass meetings, and so formidable was the\r\nmovement that the government was cowed and dared not attempt to suppress it\r\nby force. There was a defiant note of revolution in this great uprising of\r\nthe workers. They demanded an eight-hour day and the right to organize\r\nunions and make collective bargains. In addition to these demands, they\r\nprotested against the Balkan War and against militarism in general.\r\n\r\nHad the great war not intervened, a tragic interlude in Russia's long\r\nhistory of struggle, the year 1914 would have seen the greatest struggle\r\nfor the overthrow of Czarism in all that history. Whether it would have\r\nbeen more successful than the effort of 1905 can never be known, but it is\r\ncertain that the working-class revolutionary movement was far stronger\r\nthan it was nine years before. On the other hand, there would not have been\r\nthe same degree of support from the other classes, for in the intervening\r\nperiod class lines had been more sharply drawn and the class conflict\r\ngreatly intensified. Surging through the masses like a mighty tide was the\r\nspirit of revolt, manifesting itself much as it had done nine years before.\r\nAll through the early months of the year the revolutionary temper grew. The\r\nworkers became openly defiant and the government, held in check, doubtless,\r\nby the delicate balance of the international situation, dared not resort to\r\nforce with sufficient vigor to stamp out the agitation. Mass meetings were\r\nheld in spite of all regulations to the contrary; political strikes\r\noccurred in all parts of the country. In St. Petersburg and Moscow\r\nbarricades were thrown up in the streets as late as July. Then the war\r\nclouds burst. A greater passion than that of revolution swept over the\r\nnation and it turned to present a united front to the external foe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE WAR AND THE PEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe war against Austria and Germany was not unpopular. Certainly there was\r\nnever an occasion when a declaration of war by their rulers roused so\r\nlittle resentment among the Russian people. Wars are practically never\r\npopular with the great mass of the people in any country, and this is\r\nespecially true of autocratically governed countries. The heavy burdens\r\nwhich all great wars impose upon the laboring class, as well as upon the\r\npetty bourgeoisie, cause even the most righteous wars to be regarded with\r\ndread and sorrow. The memory of the war with Japan was too fresh and too\r\nbitter to make it possible for the mass of the Russian people to welcome\r\nthe thought of another war. It cannot, therefore, in truth be said that the\r\nwar with the Central Empires was popular. But it can be said with sincerity\r\nand the fullest sanction that the war was not unpopular; that it was\r\naccepted by the greater part of the people as a just and, moreover, a\r\nnecessary war. Opposition to the war was not greater in Russia than in\r\nEngland or France, or, later, in America. Of course, there were religious\r\npacifists and Socialists who opposed the war and denounced it, as they\r\nwould have denounced any other war, on general principles, no matter what\r\nthe issues involved might be, but their number and their influence were\r\nsmall and quite unimportant.\r\n\r\nThe one great outstanding fact was the manner in which the sense of peril\r\nto the fatherland rallied to its defense the different races, creeds,\r\nclasses, and parties, the great tidal wave of genuine and sincere\r\npatriotism sweeping everything before it, even the mighty, passionate\r\nrevolutionary agitation. It can hardly be questioned or doubted that if the\r\nwar had been bitterly resented by the masses it would have precipitated\r\nrevolution instead of retarding it. From this point of view the war was a\r\ndeplorable disaster. That no serious attempt was made to bring about a\r\nrevolution at that time is the best possible evidence that the declaration\r\nof war did not enrage the people. If not a popular and welcome event,\r\ntherefore, the declaration of war by the Czar was not an unpopular one.\r\nNever before since his accession to the throne had Nicholas II had the\r\nsupport of the nation to anything like the same extent.\r\n\r\nTake the Jews, for example. Bitterly hated and persecuted as they had been,\r\ndespised and humiliated beyond description; victims of the knout and the\r\npogrom; tortured by Cossacks and Black Hundreds; robbed by official\r\nextortions; their women shamed and ravaged and their babies doomed to rot\r\nand die in the noisome Pale--the Jews owed no loyalty to the Czar or even\r\nto the nation. Had they sought revenge in the hour of Russia's crisis, in\r\nhowsoever grim a manner, it would have been easy to understand their action\r\nand hard indeed to regard it with condemnation. It is almost unthinkable\r\nthat the Czar could have thought of the Jews in his vast Empire in those\r\ndays without grave apprehension and fear.\r\n\r\nYet, as all the world knows, the Jews resolutely overcame whatever\r\nsuggestion of revenge came to them and, with marvelous solidarity,\r\nresponded to Russia's call without hesitation and without political\r\nintrigue or bargaining. As a whole, they were as loyal as any of the\r\nCzar's subjects. How shall we explain this phenomenon?\r\n\r\nThe explanation is that the leaders of the Jewish people, and practically\r\nthe whole body of Jewish Intellectuals, recognized from the first that the\r\nwar was more than a war of conflicting dynasties; that it was a war of\r\nconflicting ideals. They recognized that the Entente, as a whole,\r\nnotwithstanding that it included the autocracy of Russia, represented the\r\ngenerous, democratic ideals and principles vital to every Jew in that they\r\nmust be securely established before the emancipation of the Jew could be\r\nrealized. Their hatred of Czarism was not engulfed by any maudlin\r\nsentiment; they knew that they had no \"fatherland\" to defend. They were not\r\nswept on a tide of jingoism to forget their tragic history and proclaim\r\ntheir loyalty to the infamous oppressor. No. Their loyalty was to the\r\nEntente, not to the Czar. They were guided by enlightened self-interest, by\r\nan intelligent understanding of the meaning to them of the great struggle\r\nagainst Teutonic militarist-imperialism.\r\n\r\nEvery intelligent and educated Jew in Russia knew that the real source of\r\nthe brutal anti-Semitism which characterized the rule of the Romanovs was\r\nPrussian and not Russian. He knew that it had long been one of the main\r\nfeatures of Germany's foreign policy to instigate and stimulate hatred and\r\nfear of the Jews by Russian officialdom. There could not be a more tragic\r\nmistake than to infer from the ruthless oppression of the Jews in Russia\r\nthat anti-Semitism is characteristically Russian. Surely, the fact that the\r\nFirst Duma was practically unanimous in deciding to give equal rights to\r\nthe Jews with all the rest of the population proves that the Russian people\r\ndid not hate the Jews. The ill-treatment of the Jews was part of the policy\r\nby which Germany, for her own ends, cunningly contrived to weaken Russia\r\nand so prevent the development of her national solidarity. Racial animosity\r\nand conflict was an ideal instrument for attaining that result. Internal\r\nwar and abortive revolutionary outbreaks which kept the country unsettled,\r\nand the energies of the government taxed to the uttermost, served the same\r\nend, and were, therefore, the object of Germany's intrigues in Russia,\r\nequally with hostility to the Jews, as we shall have occasion to note.\r\n\r\nGerman intrigue in Russia is an interesting study in economic determinism.\r\nUnless we comprehend it we shall strive in vain to understand Russia's part\r\nin the war and her rôle in the history of the past few decades. A brief\r\nstudy of the map of Europe by any person who possesses even an elementary\r\nknowledge of the salient principles of economics will reveal Germany's\r\ninterest in Russia and make quite plain why German statesmen have so\r\nassiduously aimed to keep Russia in a backward economic condition. As a\r\ngreat industrial nation it was to Germany's interest to have Russia remain\r\nbackward industrially, predominantly an agricultural country, quite as\r\nsurely as it was to her interest as a military power to have weakness and\r\ninefficiency, instead of strength and efficiency, in Russia's military\r\norganization. As a highly developed industrial nation Russia would of\r\nnecessity have been Germany's formidable rival--perhaps her most formidable\r\nrival--and by her geographical situation would have possessed an enormous\r\nadvantage in the exploitation of the vast markets in the far East. As a\r\nfeudal agricultural country, on the other hand, Russia would be a great\r\nmarket for German manufactured goods, and, at the same time, a most\r\nconvenient supply-depot for raw materials and granary upon which Germany\r\ncould rely for raw materials, wheat, rye, and other staple grains--a\r\nsupply-depot and granary, moreover, accessible by overland transportation\r\nnot subject to naval attack.\r\n\r\nFor the Russian Jew the defeat of Germany was a vital necessity. The\r\nvictory of Germany and her allies could only serve to strengthen Prussian\r\ninfluence in Russia and add to the misery and suffering of the Jewish\r\npopulation. That other factors entered into the determination of the\r\nattitude of the Jews, such as, for example, faith in England as the\r\ntraditional friend of the Jew, and abhorrence at the cruel invasion of\r\nBelgium, is quite true. But the great determinant was the well-understood\r\nfact that Germany's rulers had long systematically manipulated Russian\r\npolitics and the Russian bureaucracy to the serious injury of the Jewish\r\nrace. Germany's militarist-imperialism was the soul and inspiration of the\r\noppression which cursed every Jew in Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe democratic elements in Russia were led to support the government by\r\nvery similar reasoning. The same economic and dynastic motives which had\r\nled Germany to promote racial animosities and struggles in Russia led her\r\nto take every other possible means to uphold autocracy and prevent the\r\nestablishment of democracy. This had been long recognized by all liberal\r\nRussians, no matter to what political school or party they might belong. It\r\nwas as much part of the common knowledge as the fact that St. Petersburg\r\nwas the national capital. It was part of the intellectual creed of\r\npractically every liberal Russian that there was a natural affinity between\r\nthe great autocracies of Germany and Russia, and that a revolution in\r\nRussia which seriously endangered the existence of monarchical absolutism\r\nwould be suppressed by Prussian guns and bayonets reinforcing those of\r\nloyal Russian troops. It was generally believed by Russian Socialists that\r\nin 1905 the Kaiser had promised to send troops into Russia to crush the\r\nRevolution if called upon for that aid. Many German Socialists, it may be\r\nadded, shared that belief. Autocracies have a natural tendency to combine\r\nforces against revolutionary movements. It would have been no more strange\r\nfor Wilhelm II to aid Nicholas II in quelling a revolution that menaced his\r\nthrone than it was for Alexander I to aid in putting down revolution in\r\nGermany; or than it was for Nicholas I to crush the Hungarian Revolution in\r\n1849, in the interest of Francis Joseph; or than it was for Bismarck to\r\nrush to the aid of Alexander II in putting down the Polish insurrection in\r\n1863.\r\n\r\nThe democrats of Russia knew, moreover, that, in addition to the natural\r\naffinity which served to bind the two autocracies, the Romanov and\r\nHohenzollern dynasties had been closely knit together in a strong union by\r\nyears and years of carefully planned and strongly wrought blood ties. As\r\nIsaac Don Lenine reminds us in his admirable study of the Russian\r\nRevolution, Nicholas II was more than seven-eighths German, less than\r\none-eighth of his blood heritage being Romanov. Catherine the Great, wife\r\nof Peter III, was a Prussian by birth and heritage and thoroughly\r\nPrussianized her court. After her--from 1796 to 1917--six Czars reigned in\r\nRussia, five of whom married German wives. As was inevitable in such\r\ncircumstances, the Russian court had long been notoriously subject to\r\nGerman influences and strongly pro-German in its sympathies--by no means a\r\nsmall matter in an autocratic country. Fully aware of their advantage, the\r\nKaiser and his Ministers increased the German influence and power at the\r\nRussian court by encouraging German nobles to marry into Russian court\r\ncircles. The closing decade of the reign of Nicholas II was marked by an\r\nextraordinary increase of Prussian influence in his court, an achievement\r\nin which the Kaiser was greatly assisted by the Czarina, who was, it will\r\nbe remembered, a German princess.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the German composition and character of the Czar's court was\r\nreflected in the diplomatic service and in the most important departments\r\nof the Russian government, including the army. The Russian Secret Service\r\nwas very largely in the hands of Germans and Russians who had married\r\nGerman wives. The same thing may be said of the Police Department. Many of\r\nthe generals and other high officers in the Russian army were either of\r\nGerman parentage or connected with Germany by marriage ties. In brief, the\r\nwhole Russian bureaucracy was honeycombed by German influence.\r\n\r\nOutside official circles, much the same condition existed among the great\r\nlandowners. Those of the Baltic provinces were largely of Teutonic descent,\r\nof course. Many had married German wives. The result was that the nobility\r\nof these provinces, long peculiarly influential in the political life of\r\nRussia, was, to a very large degree, pro-German. In addition to these,\r\nthere were numerous large landowners of German birth, while many, probably\r\na big majority, of the superintendents of the large industrial\r\nestablishments and landed estates were German citizens. It is notorious\r\nthat the principal factories upon which Russia had to rely for guns and\r\nmunitions were in charge of Germans, who had been introduced because of\r\ntheir high technical efficiency.\r\n\r\nIn view of these facts, and a mass of similar facts which might be cited,\r\nit was natural for the democrats of Russia to identify Germany and German\r\nintrigue and influence with the hated bureaucracy. It was as natural as it\r\nwas for the German influence to be used against the democratic movement in\r\nRussia, as it invariably was. Practically the entire mass of democratic\r\nopinion in Russia, including, of course, all the Socialist factions,\r\nregarded these royal, aristocratic, and bureaucratic German influences as a\r\nmenace to Russia, a cancer that must be cut out. With the exception of a\r\nsection of the Socialists, whose position we shall presently examine, the\r\nmass of liberal-thinking, progressive, democratic Russians saw in the war a\r\nwelcome breaking of the German yoke. Believing that the victory of Germany\r\nwould restore the yoke, and that her defeat by Russia would eliminate the\r\npower which had sustained Czarism, they welcomed the war and rallied with\r\nenthusiasm at the call to arms. They were loyal, but to Russia, not to the\r\nCzar. They felt that in warring against Prussian militarist-imperialism\r\nthey were undermining Russian Absolutism.\r\n\r\nThat the capitalists of Russia should want to see the power of Germany to\r\nhold Russia in chains completely destroyed is easy to understand. To all\r\nintents and purposes, from the purely economic point of view, Russia was\r\nvirtually a German colony to be exploited for the benefit of Germany. The\r\ncommercial treaties of 1905, which gave Germany such immense trade\r\nadvantages, had become exceedingly unpopular. On the other hand, the\r\nimmense French loan of 1905, the greater part of which had been used to\r\ndevelop the industrial life of Russia, had the effect of bringing Russian\r\ncapitalists into closer relations with French capitalists. For further\r\ncapital Russia could only look to France and England with any confident\r\nhope. Above all, the capitalists of Russia wanted freedom for economic\r\ndevelopment; they wanted stability and national unity, the very things\r\nGermany was preventing. They wanted efficient government and the\r\nelimination of the terrible corruption which infested the bureaucracy. The\r\nlaw of economic evolution was inexorable and inescapable; the capitalist\r\nsystem could not grow within the narrow confines of Absolutism.\r\n\r\nFor the Russian capitalist class, therefore, it was of the most vital\r\nimportance that Germany's power should not be increased, as it would of\r\nnecessity be if the Entente submitted to her threats and permitted Serbia\r\nto be crushed by Austria, and the furtherance of the Pan-German\r\n_Mitteleuropa_ designs. It was vitally necessary to Russian capitalism that\r\nGermany's strangle-hold upon the inner life of Russia should be broken. The\r\nissue was not the competition of capitalism, as that is commonly\r\nunderstood; it was not the rivalry for markets like that which animates the\r\ncapitalist classes of all lands. The Russian capitalist class was animated\r\nby no fear of German competition in the sense in which the nations of the\r\nworld have understood that term. They had their own vast home market to\r\ndevelop. The industrialization of the country must transform a very large\r\npart of the peasantry into factory artisans living in cities, having new\r\nneeds and relatively high wages, and, consequently, more money to spend.\r\nFor many years to come their chief reliance must be the home market,\r\nconstantly expanding as the relative importance of manufacturing increased\r\nand forced improved methods of agriculture upon the nation in the process,\r\nas it was bound to do.\r\n\r\nIt was Germany as a persistent meddler in Russian government and politics\r\nthat the capitalists of Russia resented. It was the unfair advantage that\r\nthis underhand political manipulation gave her in their own home field that\r\nstirred up the leaders of the capitalist class of Russia. That, and the\r\nknowledge that German intrigue by promoting divisions in Russia was the\r\nmainstay of the autocracy, solidified the capitalist class of Russia in\r\nsupport of the war. There was a small section of this class that went much\r\nfarther than this and entertained more ambitious hopes. They realized fully\r\nthat Turkey had already fallen under the domination of Germany to such a\r\ndegree that in the event of a German victory in the war, or, what really\r\namounted to the same thing, the submission of the Entente to her will,\r\nGermany would become the ruler of the Dardanelles and European Turkey be in\r\nreality, and perhaps in form, part of the German Empire.\r\n\r\nSuch a development could not fail, they believed, to have the most\r\ndisastrous consequences for Russia. Inevitably, it would add to German\r\nprestige and power in the Russian Empire, and weld together the\r\nHohenzollern, Habsburg, and Romanov autocracies in a solid, reactionary\r\nmass, which, under the efficient leadership of Germany, might easily\r\ndominate the entire world. Moreover, like many of the ablest Russians,\r\nincluding the foremost Marxian Socialist scholars, they believed that the\r\nnormal economic development of Russia required a free outlet to the warm\r\nwaters of the Mediterranean, which alone could give her free access to the\r\ngreat ocean highways. Therefore they hoped that one result of a victorious\r\nwar by the Entente against the Central Empires, in which Russia would play\r\nan important part, would be the acquisition of Constantinople by Russia.\r\nThus the old vision of the Czars had become the vision of an influential\r\nand rising class with a solid basis of economic interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAs in every other country involved, the Socialist movement was sharply\r\ndivided by the war. Paradoxical as it seems, in spite of the great revival\r\nof revolutionary hope and sentiment in the first half of the year, the\r\nSocialist parties and groups were not strong when the war broke out. They\r\nwere, indeed, at a very low state. They had not yet recovered from the\r\nreaction. The manipulation of the electoral laws following the dissolution\r\nof the Second Duma, and the systematic oppression and repression of all\r\nradical organizations by the administration, had greatly reduced the\r\nSocialist parties in membership and influence. The masses were, for a long\r\ntime, weary of struggle, despondent, and passive. The Socialist factions\r\nmeanwhile were engaged in an apparently interminable controversy upon\r\ntheoretical and tactical questions in which the masses of the\r\nworking-people, when they began to stir at last, took no interest, and\r\nwhich they could hardly be supposed to understand. The Socialist parties\r\nand groups were subject to a very great disability in that their leaders\r\nwere practically all in exile. Had a revolution broken out, as it would\r\nhave done but for the war, Socialist leadership would have asserted itself.\r\n\r\nAs in all other countries, the divisions of opinion created by the war\r\namong the Socialists cut across all previous existing lines of separation\r\nand made it impossible to say that this or that faction adopted a\r\nparticular view. Just as in Germany, France, and England, some of the most\r\nrevolutionary Socialists joined with the more moderate Socialists in\r\nupholding the war, while extremely moderate Socialists joined with\r\nSocialists of the opposite extreme in opposing it. It is possible, however,\r\nto set forth the principal features of the division with tolerable\r\naccuracy:\r\n\r\nA majority of the Socialist-Revolutionary party executive issued an\r\nanti-war Manifesto. There is no means of telling how far the views\r\nexpressed represented the attitude of the peasant Socialists as a whole,\r\nowing to the disorganized state of the party and the difficulties of\r\nassembling the members. The Manifesto read:\r\n\r\n    There is no doubt that Austrian imperialism is responsible for the\r\n    war with Serbia. But is it not equally criminal on the part of\r\n    Serbs to refuse autonomy to Macedonia and to oppress smaller and\r\n    weaker nations?\r\n\r\n    It is the protection of this state that our government considers\r\n    its \"sacred duty.\" What hypocrisy! Imagine the intervention of the\r\n    Czar on behalf of poor Serbia, whilst he martyrizes Poland,\r\n    Finland and the Jews, and behaves like a brigand toward Persia.\r\n\r\n    Whatever may be the course of events, the Russian workers and\r\n    peasants will continue their heroic fight to obtain for Russia a\r\n    place among civilized nations.\r\n\r\nThis Manifesto was issued, as reported in the Socialist press, prior to the\r\nactual declaration of war. It was a threat of revolution made with a view\r\nto preventing the war, if possible, and belongs to the same category as the\r\nsimilar threats of revolution made by the German Socialists before the war\r\nto the same end. The mildness of manner which characterizes the Manifesto\r\nmay be attributed to two causes--weakness of the movement and a resulting\r\nlack of assurance, together with a lack of conviction arising from the fact\r\nthat many of the leaders, while they hated the Czar and all his works, and\r\ncould not reconcile themselves to the idea of making any kind of truce with\r\ntheir great enemy, nevertheless were pro-Ally and anxious for the defeat of\r\nGerman imperialism. In other words, these leaders shared the national\r\nfeeling against Germany, and, had they been free citizens of a\r\ndemocratically governed country, would have loyally supported the war.\r\n\r\nWhen the Duma met, on August 8th, for the purpose of voting the war\r\ncredits, the Social Democrats of both factions, Bolsheviki and Mensheviki,\r\nfourteen in number,[2] united upon a policy of abstention from voting.\r\nValentin Khaustov, on behalf of the two factions, read this statement:\r\n\r\n    A terrible and unprecedented calamity has broken upon the people\r\n    of the entire world. Millions of workers have been torn away from\r\n    their labor, ruined, and swept away by a bloody torrent. Millions\r\n    of families have been delivered over to famine.\r\n\r\n    War has already begun. While the governments of Europe were\r\n    preparing for it, the proletariat of the entire world, with the\r\n    German workers at the head, unanimously protested.\r\n\r\n    The hearts of the Russian workers are with the European\r\n    proletariat. This war is provoked by the policy of expansion for\r\n    which the ruling classes of all countries are responsible.\r\n\r\n    The proletariat will defend the civilization of the world against\r\n    this attack.\r\n\r\n    The conscious proletariat of the belligerent countries has not\r\n    been sufficiently powerful to prevent this war and the resulting\r\n    return of barbarism.\r\n\r\n    But we are convinced that the working class will find in the\r\n    international solidarity of the workers the means to force the\r\n    conclusion of peace at an early date. The terms of that peace will\r\n    be dictated by the people themselves, and not by the diplomats.\r\n\r\n    We are convinced that this war will finally open the eyes of the\r\n    great masses of Europe, and show them the real causes of all the\r\n    violence and oppression that they endure, and that therefore this\r\n    new explosion of barbarism will be the last.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this declaration was read the fourteen members of the Social\r\nDemocratic group left the chamber in silence. They were immediately\r\nfollowed by the Laborites and Socialist-Revolutionists representing the\r\npeasant Socialists, so that none of the Socialists in the Duma voted for\r\nthe war credits. As we shall see later on, the Laborites and most of the\r\nSocialist-Revolutionists afterward supported the war. The declaration of\r\nthe Social Democrats in the Duma was as weak and as lacking in definiteness\r\nof policy as the Manifesto of the Socialist-Revolutionists already quoted.\r\nWe know now that it was a compromise. It was possible to get agreement upon\r\na statement of general principles which were commonplaces of Socialist\r\npropaganda, and to vaguely expressed hopes that \"the working class will\r\nfind in the international solidarity of the workers the means to force the\r\nconclusion of peace at an early date.\" It was easy enough to do this, but\r\nit would have been impossible to unite upon a definite policy of resistance\r\nand opposition to the war. It was easy to agree not to vote for the war\r\ncredits, since there was no danger that this would have any practical\r\neffect, the voting of the credits--largely a mere form--being quite\r\ncertain. It would have been impossible to get all to agree to vote\r\n_against_ the credits.\r\n\r\nUnder the strong leadership of Alexander Kerensky the Labor party soon took\r\na decided stand in support of the war. In the name of the entire group of\r\nthe party's representatives in the Duma, Kerensky read at an early session\r\na statement which pledged the party to defend the fatherland. \"We firmly\r\nbelieve,\" said Kerensky, \"that the great flower of Russian democracy,\r\ntogether with all the other forces, will throw back the aggressive enemy\r\nand _will defend their native land_.\" The party had decided, he said, to\r\nsupport the war \"in defense of the land of our birth and of our\r\ncivilization created by the blood of our race.... We believe that through\r\nthe agony of the battle-field the brotherhood of the Russian people will be\r\nstrengthened and a common desire created to free the land from its terrible\r\ninternal troubles.\" Kerensky declared that the workers would take no\r\nresponsibility for the suicidal war into which the governments of Europe\r\nhad plunged their peoples. He strongly criticized the government, but\r\nended, nevertheless, in calling upon the peasants and industrial workers to\r\nsupport the war:\r\n\r\n\"The Socialists of England, Belgium, France, and Germany have tried to\r\nprotest against rushing into war. We Russian Socialists were not able at\r\nthe last to raise our voices freely against the war. But, deeply convinced\r\nof the brotherhood of the workers of all lands, we send our brotherly\r\ngreetings to all who protested against the preparations for this\r\nfratricidal conflict of peoples. Remember that Russian citizens have no\r\nenemies among the working classes of the belligerents! _Protect your\r\ncountry to the end against aggression by the states whose governments are\r\nhostile to us, but remember that there would not have been this terrible\r\nwar had the great ideals of democracy, freedom, equality, and brotherhood\r\nbeen directing the activities of those who control the destinies of Russia\r\nand other lands!_ As it is, our authorities, even in this terrible moment,\r\nshow no desire to forget internal strife, grant no amnesty to those who\r\nhave fought for freedom and the country's happiness, show no desire for\r\nreconciliation with the non-Russian peoples of the Empire.\r\n\r\n\"And, instead of relieving the condition of the laboring classes of the\r\npeople, the government puts on them especially the heaviest load of the war\r\nexpenses, by tightening the yoke of indirect taxes.\r\n\r\n\"Peasants and workers, all who want the happiness and well-being of Russia\r\nin these great trials, harden your spirit! Gather all your strength and,\r\nhaving defended your land, free it; and to you, our brothers, who are\r\nshedding blood for the fatherland, a profound obeisance and fraternal\r\ngreetings.\"\r\n\r\nKerensky's statement was of tremendous significance. Made on behalf of the\r\nentire group of which he was leader, it reflected the sober second thought\r\nof the representatives of the peasant Socialists and socialistically\r\ninclined radicals. Their solemnly measured protest against the reactionary\r\npolicy of the government was as significant as the announcement that they\r\nwould support the war. It was a fact that at the very time when national\r\nunity was of the most vital importance the government was already goading\r\nthe people into despairing revolt.\r\n\r\nThat a section of the Bolsheviki began a secret agitation against the war,\r\naiming at a revolt among the soldiers, regardless of the fact that it would\r\nmean Russia's defeat and Germany's triumph, is a certainty. The government\r\nsoon learned of this movement and promptly took steps to crush it. Many\r\nRussian Socialists have charged that the policy of the Bolsheviki was\r\ninspired by provocateurs in the employ of the police, and by them betrayed.\r\nOthers believe that the policy was instigated by German provocateurs, for\r\nvery obvious purposes. It was not uncommon for German secret agents to worm\r\ntheir way into the Russian Socialist ranks, nor for the agents of the\r\nRussian police to keep the German secret service informed of what was going\r\non in Russian Socialist circles. Whatever truth there may be in the\r\nsuspicion that the anti-war Bolshevik faction of the Social Democrats were\r\nthe victims of the Russian police espionage system, and were betrayed by\r\none whom they had trusted, as the Socialist-Revolutionists had been\r\nbetrayed by Azev, the fact remains that the government ordered the arrest\r\nof five of the Bolshevist Social Democratic members of the Duma, on\r\nNovember 17th. Never before had the government disregarded the principle of\r\nparliamentary immunity. When members of the First Duma, belonging to\r\nvarious parties, and members of the Second Duma, belonging to the Social\r\nDemocratic party, were arrested it was only after the Duma had been\r\nformally dissolved. The arrest of the five Social Democrats while the Duma\r\nwas still sitting evoked a strong protest, even from the conservatives.\r\n\r\nThe government based its action upon the following allegations, which\r\nappear to have been substantially correct: in October arrangements were\r\nmade to convoke a secret conference of delegates of the Social Democratic\r\norganization to plan for a revolutionary uprising. The police learned of\r\nthe plan, and when at last, on November 17th, the conference was held at\r\nViborg, eight miles from Petrograd--as the national capital was now\r\ncalled--a detachment of police found eleven persons assembled, including\r\nfive members of the Imperial Duma, Messrs. Petrovsky, Badavev, Mouranov,\r\nSamoelov, and Chagov. The police arrested six persons, but did not arrest\r\nthe Duma members, on account of their parliamentary position. An examining\r\nmagistrate, however, indicted the whole eleven who attended the conference,\r\nunder Article No. 102 of the Penal Code, and issued warrants for their\r\narrest. Among those arrested was Kamanev, one of Lenine's closest friends,\r\nwho behaved so badly at his trial, manifesting so much cowardice, that he\r\nwas censured by his party.\r\n\r\nAt this conference, according to the government, arrangements were made to\r\ncirculate among the masses a Manifesto which declared that \"from the\r\nviewpoint of the working class and of the laboring masses of all the\r\nnations of Russia, the defeat of the monarchy of the Czar and of its armies\r\nwould be of extremely little consequence.\" The Manifesto urged the\r\nimperative necessity of _carrying on on all sides the propaganda of the\r\nsocial revolution among the army and at the theater of the war, and that\r\nweapons should be directed not against their brothers, the hired slaves of\r\nother countries, but against the reactionary bourgeois governments_. The\r\nManifesto went on, according to the government, to favor the organization\r\nof a similar propaganda in all languages, among all the armies, with the\r\naim of creating republics in Russia, Poland, Germany, Austria, and all\r\nother European countries, these to be federated into a republican United\r\nStares of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe declaration that the defeat of the Russian armies would be \"of\r\nextremely little consequence\" to the workers became the key-note of the\r\nanti-war agitation of the Bolsheviki. Lenine and Zinoviev, still in exile,\r\nadopted the view that the defeat of Russia was _actually desirable_ from\r\nthe point of view of the Russian working class. \"We are Russians, and for\r\nthat very reason we want Czarism to be defeated,\" was the cry.[3] In his\r\npaper, the _Social Democrat_, published in Switzerland, Lenine advocated\r\nRussian defeat, to be brought about through treachery and revolt in the\r\narmy, as the best means of furthering revolutionary progress. The majority\r\nof the Bolshevik faction made common cause with the extreme left-wing\r\nSocialists of the Socialist-Revolutionary party, who shared their views and\r\nbecame known as \"Porazhentsi\"--that is, advocates of defeat. Naturally, the\r\ncharge was made that they were pro-German, and it was even charged that\r\nthey were in the pay of Germany. Possibly some of them were, but it by no\r\nmeans follows that because they desired Russia's defeat they were therefore\r\nconsciously pro-German. They were not pro-German, but anti-Czarists. They\r\nbelieved quite honestly, most of them, that Russia's defeat was the surest\r\nand quickest way of bringing about the Revolution in Russia which would\r\noverthrow Czarism. In many respects their position was quite like that of\r\nthose Irish rebels who desired to see England defeated, even though it\r\nmeant Germany's triumph, not because of any love for Germany, but because\r\nthey hated England and believed that her defeat would be Ireland's\r\nopportunity. However short-sighted and stupid such a policy may be judged\r\nto be, it is quite comprehensible and should not be misrepresented. It is a\r\nremarkable fact that the Bolsheviki, while claiming to be the most radical\r\nand extreme internationalists, were in practice the most narrow\r\nnationalists. They were exactly as narrow in their nationalism as the\r\nSinn-Feiners of Ireland. They were not blind to the terrible wrongs\r\ninflicted upon Belgium, or to the fact that Germany's victory over Russia\r\nwould make it possible for her to crush the western democracies, France and\r\nEngland. But neither to save Belgium nor to prevent German militarism\r\ncrushing French and English workers under its iron heel would they have the\r\nRussian workers make any sacrifice. They saw, and cared only for, what they\r\nbelieved to be _Russian_ interests.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nBut during the first months of the war the Porazhentsi--including the\r\nBolsheviki--were a very small minority. The great majority of the\r\nSocialist-Revolutionists rallied to the support of the Allied cause. Soon\r\nafter the war began a Socialist Manifesto to the laboring masses of Russia\r\nwas issued. It bore the signature of many of the best-known Russian\r\nSocialists, representing all the Socialist factions and groups except the\r\nBolsheviki. Among the names were those of George Plechanov, Leo Deutsch,\r\nGregory Alexinsky, N. Avksentiev, B. Vorovonov, I. Bunakov, and A.\r\nBach--representing the best thought of the movement in practically all its\r\nphases. This document is of the greatest historical importance, not merely\r\nbecause it expressed the sentiments of Socialists of so many shades, but\r\neven more because of its carefully reasoned arguments why Socialists should\r\nsupport the war and why the defeat of Germany was essential to Russian and\r\ninternational social democracy. Despite its great length, the Manifesto is\r\nhere given in its entirety:\r\n\r\n    We, the undersigned, belong to the different shades of Russian\r\n    Socialistic thought. We differ on many things, but we firmly agree\r\n    in that the defeat of Russia in her struggle with Germany would\r\n    mean her defeat in her struggle for freedom, and we think that,\r\n    guided by this conviction, our adherents in Russia must come\r\n    together for a common service to their people, in the hour of the\r\n    grave danger the country is now facing.\r\n\r\n    We address ourselves to the politically conscious working-men,\r\n    peasants, artisans, clerks--to all of those who earn their bread\r\n    in the sweat of their brow, and who, suffering from the lack of\r\n    means and want of political rights, are struggling for a better\r\n    future for themselves, for their children, and for their brethren.\r\n\r\n    We send them our hearty greeting, and persistently say to them:\r\n    Listen to us in this fatal time, when the enemy has conquered the\r\n    Western strongholds of Russia, has occupied an important part of\r\n    our territory and is menacing Kiev, Petrograd, and Moscow, these\r\n    most important centers of our social life.\r\n\r\n    Misinformed people may tell you that in defending yourselves from\r\n    German invasion you support our old political régime. These people\r\n    want to see Russia defeated because of their hatred of the Czar's\r\n    government. Like one of the heroes of our genius of satire,\r\n    Shchedrin, they mix fatherland with its temporary bosses. But\r\n    Russia belongs not to the Czar, but to the Russian working-people.\r\n    In defending Russia, the working-people defend themselves, defend\r\n    the road to their freedom. As we said before, the inevitable\r\n    consequences of German victory would be the strengthening of our\r\n    old régime.\r\n\r\n    The Russian reactionaries understand this very thoroughly. _In a\r\n    faint, half-hearted manner they are defending Russia from\r\n    Germany_. The Ministers who resigned recently, Maklakov and\r\n    Shcheglovitov, presented a secret report to the Czar, in November,\r\n    1914, in which they explained how advantageous it would be for the\r\n    Czar to make a separate peace with Germany. _They understand that\r\n    the defeat of Germany would be a defeat of the principles of\r\n    monarchism, so dear to all our European reactionaries_.\r\n\r\n    Our people will never forget _the failure of the Czar's government\r\n    to defend Russia_. But if the progressive, the politically\r\n    conscious people will not take part in the struggle against\r\n    Germany, the Czar's government will have an excuse for saying: \"It\r\n    is not our fault that Germany defeats us; it is the fault of the\r\n    revolutionists who have betrayed their country,\" and this will\r\n    vindicate the government in the eyes of the people.\r\n\r\n    The political situation in Russia is such that only across the\r\n    bridge of national defense can we reach freedom. Remember, _we do\r\n    not tell you, first victory against the external enemy and then\r\n    revolution against the internal, the Czar's government_.\r\n\r\n    In the course of events the defeat of the Czar's government may\r\n    serve as a necessary preliminary condition for, and even as a\r\n    guaranty of, the elimination of the German danger. The French\r\n    revolutionists of the end of the eighteenth century would never\r\n    have been able to have overcome the enemy, attacking France on all\r\n    sides, had they not adopted such tactics only when the popular\r\n    movement against the old régime became mature enough to render\r\n    their efforts effective.\r\n\r\n    Furthermore, you must not be embarrassed by the arguments of those\r\n    who believe that every one who defends his country refuses thereby\r\n    to take part in the struggle of the classes. These persons do not\r\n    know what they are talking about. In the first place, in order\r\n    that the struggle of the classes in Russia should be successful,\r\n    certain social and political conditions must exist there. _These\r\n    conditions will not exist if Germany wins_.\r\n\r\n    In the second place, if the working-man of Russia cannot but\r\n    defend himself against the exploitation of the Russian landed\r\n    aristocrat and capitalist it seems incomprehensible that he should\r\n    remain inactive when the lasso of exploitation is being drawn\r\n    around his neck by the German landed aristocracy (the _Junker_)\r\n    and the German capitalist who are, unfortunately, at the present\r\n    time _supported by a considerable part of the German proletariat\r\n    that has turned traitor to its duty of solidarity with the\r\n    proletariat of other countries_.\r\n\r\n    By striving to the utmost to cut this lasso of German\r\n    imperialistic exploitation, the proletariat of Russia will\r\n    continue the struggle of the classes in that form which at the\r\n    present moment is most appropriate, fruitful, and effective.\r\n\r\n    It has been our country's fate once before to suffer from the\r\n    bloody horrors of a hostile invasion. But never before did it have\r\n    to defend itself against an enemy so well armed, so skilfully\r\n    organized, so carefully prepared for his plundering enterprise as\r\n    he is now.\r\n\r\n    The position of the country is dangerous to the highest degree;\r\n    therefore upon all of you, upon all the politically conscious\r\n    children of the working-people of Russia, lies an enormous\r\n    responsibility.\r\n\r\n    If you say to yourselves that it is immaterial to you and to your\r\n    less developed brothers as to who wins in this great international\r\n    collision going on now, and if you act accordingly, Russia will be\r\n    crushed by Germany. And when Russia will be crushed by Germany, it\r\n    will fare badly with the Allies. This does not need any\r\n    demonstration.\r\n\r\n    But if, on the contrary, you become convinced that the defeat of\r\n    Russia will reflect badly upon the interests of the working\r\n    population, and if you will help the self-defense of our country\r\n    with all your forces, our country and her allies will escape the\r\n    terrible danger menacing them.\r\n\r\n    Therefore, go deeply into the situation. You make a great mistake\r\n    if you imagine that it is not to the interests of the\r\n    working-people to defend our country. In reality, nobody's\r\n    interests suffer more terribly from the invasion of an enemy than\r\n    the interests of the working-population.\r\n\r\n    Take, for instance, the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71. When the\r\n    Germans besieged Paris and the cost of all the necessaries of life\r\n    rose enormously, it was clear that the poor suffered much more\r\n    than the rich. In the same way, when Germany exacted five billions\r\n    of contribution from vanquished France, this same, in the final\r\n    count, was paid by the poor; for paying that contribution indirect\r\n    taxation was greatly raised, the burden of which nearly entirely\r\n    falls on the lower classes.\r\n\r\n    More than that. The most dangerous consequence to France, due to\r\n    her defeat in 1870-71, was the retardation of her economic\r\n    development. In other words, the defeat of France badly reflected\r\n    upon the contemporary interests of her people, and, even more,\r\n    upon her entire subsequent development.\r\n\r\n    The defeat of Russia by Germany will much more injure our people\r\n    than the defeat of France injured the French people. The war now\r\n    exacts incredibly large expenditures. It is more difficult for\r\n    Russia, a country economically backward, to bear that expenditure\r\n    than for the wealthy states of western Europe. Russia's back, even\r\n    before the war, was burdened with a heavy state loan. Now this\r\n    debt is growing by the hour, and vast regions of Russia are\r\n    subject to wholesale devastation.\r\n\r\n    If the Germans will win the final victory, they will demand from\r\n    us an enormous contribution, in comparison with which the streams\r\n    of gold that poured into victorious Germany from vanquished\r\n    France, after the war of 1871, will seem a mere trifle.\r\n\r\n    But that will not be all. The most consequent and outspoken\r\n    heralds of German imperialism are even now saying that it is\r\n    necessary to exact from Russia the cession of important territory,\r\n    which should be cleared from the present population for the\r\n    greater convenience of German settlers. Never before have\r\n    plunderers, dreaming of despoiling a conquered people, displayed\r\n    such cynical heartlessness!\r\n\r\n    But for our vanquishers it will not be enough to exact an\r\n    unheard-of enormous contribution and to tear up our western\r\n    borderlands. Already, in 1904, Russia, being in a difficult\r\n    situation, was obliged to conclude a commercial treaty with\r\n    Germany, very disadvantageous to herself. The treaty hindered, at\r\n    the same time, the development of our agriculture and the progress\r\n    of our industries. It affected, with equal disadvantage, the\r\n    interests of the farmers as well as of those engaged in industry.\r\n    It is easy to imagine what kind of a treaty victorious German\r\n    imperialism would impose upon us. In economic matters, Russia\r\n    would become a German colony. Russia's further economic\r\n    development would be greatly hindered if not altogether stopped.\r\n    Degeneration and deprivation would be the result of German victory\r\n    for an important part of the Russian working-people.\r\n\r\n    What will German victory bring to western Europe? After all we\r\n    have already said, it is needless to expatiate on how many of the\r\n    unmerited economic calamities it will bring to the people of the\r\n    western countries allied to Russia. We wish to draw your attention\r\n    to the following: England, France, even Belgium and Italy, are, in\r\n    a political sense, far ahead of the German Empire, which has not\r\n    as yet grown up to a parliamentary régime. German victory over\r\n    these countries would be the victory of the old over the new, and\r\n    if the democratic ideal is dear to you, you must wish success to\r\n    our Western Allies.\r\n\r\n    Indifference to the result of this war would be, for us, equal to\r\n    political suicide. The most important, the most vital interests of\r\n    the proletariat and of the laboring peasantry demand of you an\r\n    active participation in the defense of the country. Your watchword\r\n    must be victory over the foreign enemy. In an active movement\r\n    toward such victory, the live forces of the people will become\r\n    free and strong.\r\n\r\n    Obedient to this watchword, you must be as wise as serpents.\r\n    Although in your hearts may burn the flame of noble indignation,\r\n    in your heads must reign, invariably, cold political reckoning.\r\n    You must know that zeal without reason is sometimes worse than\r\n    complete indifference. Every act of agitation in the rear of the\r\n    army, fighting against the enemy, would be equivalent to high\r\n    treason, as it would be a service to the foreign enemy.\r\n\r\n    The thunders of the war certainly cannot make the Russian\r\n    manufacturers and merchants more idealistic than they were in time\r\n    of peace. In the filling of the numerous orders, inevitable during\r\n    the mobilization of industry for war needs, the capitalists will,\r\n    as they are accustomed to, take great care of the interests of\r\n    capital, and will not take care of the interests of hired labor.\r\n    You will be entirely right if you wax indignant at their conduct.\r\n    But in all cases, whenever you desire to answer by a strike, you\r\n    must first think whether such action would not be detrimental to\r\n    the cause of the defense of Russia.\r\n\r\n    The private must be subject to the general. The workmen of every\r\n    factory must remember that they would commit, without any doubt,\r\n    the gravest mistake if, considering only their own interests, they\r\n    forget how severely the interests of the entire Russian\r\n    proletariat and peasantry would suffer from German victory.\r\n\r\n    The tactics which can be defined by the motto, \"All or nothing,\"\r\n    are the tactics of anarchy, fully unworthy of the conscious\r\n    representatives of the proletariat and peasantry. The General\r\n    Staff of the German Army would greet with pleasure the news that\r\n    we had adopted such tactics. _Believe us that this Staff is ready\r\n    to help all those who would like to preach it in our country_.\r\n    They want trouble in Russia, they want strikes in England, they\r\n    want everything that would facilitate the achievement of their\r\n    conquering schemes.\r\n\r\n    But you will not make them rejoice. You will not forget the words\r\n    of our great fabulist: \"What the enemy advises is surely bad.\" You\r\n    must insist that all your representatives take the most active\r\n    part in all organizations created now, under the pressure of\r\n    public opinion, for the struggle with the foe. Your\r\n    representatives must, if possible, take part not only in the work\r\n    of the special technical organizations, such as the War-Industrial\r\n    Committees which have been created for the needs of the army, but\r\n    also in all other organizations of social and political character.\r\n\r\n    The situation is such that we cannot come to freedom in any other\r\n    way than by the war of national defense.\r\n\r\nThat the foregoing Manifesto expressed the position of the vast majority of\r\nRussian Socialists there can be no doubt whatever. Between this position\r\nand that of the Porazhentsi with their doctrine that Russia's defeat by\r\nGermany was desirable, there was a middle ground, which was taken by a not\r\ninconsiderable number of Socialists, including such able leaders as Paul\r\nAxelrod. Those who took up this intermediate position were both\r\nanti-Czarists and anti-German-imperialists. They were pro-Ally in the large\r\nsense, and desired to see the Allies win over the Central Empires, if not a\r\n\"crushing\" victory, a very definite and conclusive one. But they regarded\r\nthe alliance of Czarism with the Allies as an unnatural marriage. They\r\nbelieved that autocratic Russia's natural alliance was with autocratic\r\nGermany and Austria. Their hatred of Czarism led them to wish for its\r\ndefeat, even by Germany, provided the victory were not so great as to\r\npermit Germany to extend her domain over Russia or any large part of it.\r\nTheir position became embodied in the phrase, \"Victory by the Allies on the\r\nwest and Russia's defeat on the east.\" This was, of course, utterly\r\nunpractical theorizing and bore no relation to reality.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThanks in part to the vigorous propaganda of such leaders as Plechanov,\r\nDeutsch, Bourtzev, Tseretelli, Kerensky, and many others, and in part to\r\nthe instinctive good sense of the masses, support of the war by Socialists\r\nof all shades and factions--except the extreme Bolsheviki and\r\nthe so-called \"Internationalist\" sections of Mensheviki and\r\nSocialist-Revolutionists--became general. The anti-war minority was\r\nexceedingly small and had no hold upon the masses. Had the government been\r\nboth wise and honestly desirous of presenting a united front to the foe,\r\nand to that end made intelligent and generous concessions to the democratic\r\nmovement, it is most unlikely that Russia would have collapsed. As it was,\r\nthe government adopted a policy which could not fail to weaken the military\r\nforce of the nation--a policy admirably suited to German needs.\r\n\r\nExtremes meet. On the one hand there were the Porazhentsi Socialists,\r\ncontending that the interests of progress would be best served by a German\r\nvictory over Russia, and plotting to weaken and corrupt the morale of the\r\nRussian army and to stir up internal strife to that end. On the other hand,\r\nwithin the royal court, and throughout the bureaucracy, reactionary\r\npro-German officials were animated by the belief that the victory of\r\nGermany was essential to the permanence of Absolutism and autocratic\r\ngovernment. They, too, like the Socialist \"defeatists,\" aimed to weaken\r\nand corrupt the morale of the army and to divide the nation.\r\n\r\nThese Germanophiles in places of power realized that they had unconscious\r\nbut exceedingly useful allies in the Socialist intransigents. Actuated by\r\nmotives however high, the latter played into the hands of the most corrupt\r\nand reactionary force that ever infested the old régime. This force, the\r\nreactionary Germanophiles, had from the very first hoped and believed that\r\nGermany would win the war. They had exerted every ounce of pressure they\r\ncould command to keep the Czar from maintaining the treaty with France and\r\nentering into the war on her side against Germany and Austria. When they\r\nfailed in this, they bided their time, full of confidence that the superior\r\nefficiency of the German military machine would soon triumph. But when they\r\nwitnessed the great victorious onward rush of the Russian army, which for a\r\ntime manifested such a degree of efficiency as they had never believed to\r\nbe possible, they began to bestir themselves. From this quarter came the\r\nsuggestion, very early in the war, as Plechanov and his associates charged\r\nin their Manifesto, that the Czar ought to make an early peace with\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nThey went much farther than this. Through every conceivable channel they\r\ncontrived to obstruct Russia's military effort. They conspired to\r\ndisorganize the transportation system, the hospital service, the\r\nfood-supply, the manufacture of munitions. They, too, in a most effective\r\nmanner, were plotting to weaken and corrupt the morale of the army. There\r\nwas universal uneasiness. In the Allied chancelleries there was fear of a\r\ntreacherous separate peace between Russia and Germany. It was partly to\r\navert that catastrophe by means of a heavy bribe that England undertook the\r\nforcing of the Dardanelles. All over Russia there was an awakening of the\r\nmemories of the graft that ate like a canker-worm at the heart of the\r\nnation. Men told once more the story of the Russian general in Manchuria,\r\nin 1904, who, when asked why fifty thousand men were marching barefoot,\r\nanswered that the boots were in the pocket of Grand-Duke Vladimir! They\r\ntold again the story of the cases of \"shells\" for the Manchurian army which\r\nwere intercepted in the nation's capital, _en route_ to Moscow, and found\r\nto contain--paving-stones! How General Kuropatkin managed to amass a\r\nfortune of over six million rubles during the war with Japan was\r\nremembered. Fear that the same kind of treason was being perpetrated grew\r\nalmost to the panic point.\r\n\r\nSo bad were conditions in the army, so completely had the Germanophile\r\nreactionaries sabotaged the organization, that the people themselves took\r\nthe matter in hand. Municipalities all over the country formed a Union of\r\nCities to furnish food, clothes, and other necessaries to the army. The\r\nNational Union of Zemstvos did the same thing. More than three thousand\r\ninstitutions were established on the different Russian fronts by the\r\nNational Union of Zemstvos. These institutions included hospitals,\r\nambulance stations, feeding stations for troops on the march, dental\r\nstations, veterinary stations, factories for manufacturing supplies, motor\r\ntransportation services, and so on through a long catalogue of things which\r\nthe administration absolutely failed to provide. The same great\r\norganization furnished millions of tents and millions of pairs of boots and\r\nsocks. Civil Russia was engaged in a great popular struggle to overcome\r\nincompetence, corruption, and sabotage in the bureaucracy. For this work\r\nthe civilian agencies were not thanked by the government. Instead, they\r\nwere oppressed and hindered. Against them was directed the hate of the\r\ndark forces of the \"occult government\" and at the same time the fierce\r\nopposition and scorn of men who called themselves Socialists and champions\r\nof proletarian freedom!\r\n\r\nThere was treachery in the General Staff and throughout the War Department,\r\nat the very head of which was a corrupt traitor, Sukhomlinov. It was\r\ntreachery in the General Staff which led to the tragic disasters in East\r\nPrussia. The great drive of the Austrian and German armies in 1915, which\r\nled to the loss of Poland, Lithuania, and large parts of Volhynia and\r\nCourland, and almost entirely eliminated Russia from the war, was\r\nunquestionably brought about by co-operation with the German General Staff\r\non the part of the sinister \"occult government,\" as the Germanophile\r\nreactionary conspiracy in the highest circles came to be known.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that Plechanov and his friends in their Manifesto to the Russian\r\nworkers declared that the reactionaries were defending Russia from\r\nsubjugation by Germany in \"a half-hearted way,\" and that \"our people will\r\nnever forget the failure of the Czar's government to defend Russia.\" They\r\nwere only saying, in very moderate language, what millions were thinking;\r\nwhat, a few months later, many of the liberal spokesmen of the country were\r\nready to say in harsher language. As early as January, 1915, the Duma met\r\nand cautiously expressed its alarm. In July it met again, many of the\r\nmembers coming directly from the front, in uniform. Only the fear that a\r\nrevolution would make the continuance of the war impossible prevented a\r\nrevolution at that time. The Duma was in a revolutionary mood. Miliukov,\r\nfor example, thundered:\r\n\r\n\" ... In January we came here with ... the feeling of patriotic alarm. We\r\nthen kept this feeling to ourselves. Yet in closed sessions of committees\r\nwe told the government all that filled the soul of the people. The answer\r\nwe received did not calm us; it amounted to saying that the government\r\ncould get along without us, without our co-operation. To-day we have\r\nconvened in a grave moment of trial for our fatherland. The patriotic alarm\r\nof the people has proved to be well founded, to the misfortune of our\r\ncountry. Secret things have become open, and the assertions of half a year\r\nago have turned out to be mere words. Yet the country cannot be satisfied\r\nwith words. _The people wish to take affairs into their own hands and to\r\ncorrect what has been neglected. The people look upon us as legal executors\r\nof their will_.\"\r\n\r\nKerensky spoke to the same general effect, adding, \"_I appeal to the people\r\nthemselves to take into their hands the salvation of the country and fight\r\nfor a full right to govern the state_.\" The key-note of revolution was\r\nbeing sounded now. For the spirit of revolution breathed in the words, \"The\r\npeople wish to take affairs into their own hands,\" and in Kerensky's\r\nchallenge, \"I appeal to the people themselves to take into their hands the\r\nsalvation of the country.\" The Duma was the logical center around which the\r\ndemocratic forces of the country could rally. Its moderate character\r\ndetermined this. Only its example was necessary to the development of a\r\ngreat national movement to overthrow the old régime with its manifold\r\ntreachery, corruption, and incompetence. When, on August 22d, the\r\nProgressive Bloc was formed by a coalition of Constitutional Democrats,\r\nProgressives, Nationalists, and Octobrists--the last-named group having\r\nhitherto generally supported the government--there was a general chorus of\r\napproval throughout the country, If the program of the Bloc was not radical\r\nenough to satisfy the various Socialist groups, even the Laborites, led by\r\nKerensky, it was, nevertheless, a program which they could support in the\r\nmain, as far as it went.\r\n\r\nAll over the country there was approval of the demand for a responsible\r\ngovernment. The municipal councils of the large cities passed resolutions\r\nin support of it. The great associations of manufacturers supported it. All\r\nover the nation the demand for a responsible government was echoed. It was\r\ngenerally believed that the Czar and his advisers would accept the\r\nsituation and accede to the popular demand. But once more the influence of\r\nthe reactionaries triumphed, and on September 3d came the defiant answer of\r\nthe government to the people. It was an order suspending the Duma\r\nindefinitely. The gods make mad those whom they would destroy.\r\n\r\nThings went from bad to worse. More and more oppressive grew the\r\ngovernment; more and more stupidly brutal and reactionary in its dealings\r\nwith the wide-spread popular unrest. Heavier and heavier grew the burden of\r\nunscientific and unjustly distributed taxation. Worse and worse became the\r\ncondition of the soldiers at the front; ever more scandalous the neglect of\r\nthe sick and wounded. Incompetence, corruption, and treason combined to\r\nhurry the nation onward to a disastrous collapse. The Germanophiles were\r\nstill industriously at work in the most important and vital places,\r\npractising sabotage upon a scale never dreamed of before in the history of\r\nany nation. They played upon the fears of the miserable weakling who was\r\nthe nominal ruler of the vast Russian Empire, and frightened him into\r\nsanctioning the most suicidal policy of devising new measures of oppression\r\ninstead of making generous concessions.\r\n\r\nRussia possessed food in abundance, being far better off in this respect\r\nthan any other belligerent on either side, yet Russia was in the grip of\r\nfamine. There was a vast surplus of food grains and cereals over and above\r\nthe requirements of the army and the civilian population, yet there was\r\nwide-spread hunger. Prices rose to impossible levels. The most astonishing\r\nanarchy and disorganization characterized the administration of the\r\nfood-supply. It was possible to get fresh butter within an hour's journey\r\nfrom Moscow for twenty-five cents a pound, but in Moscow the price was two\r\nand a half dollars a pound. Here, as throughout the nation, incompetence\r\nwas reinforced by corruption and pro-German treachery. Many writers have\r\ncalled attention to the fact that even in normal times the enormous\r\nexportation of food grains in Russia went on side by side with per capita\r\nunderconsumption by the peasants whose labor produced the great harvests,\r\namounting to not less than 30 per cent. Now, of course, conditions were far\r\nworse.\r\n\r\nWhen the government was urged to call a convention of national leaders to\r\ndeal with the food situation it stubbornly refused. More than that, it made\r\nwar upon the only organizations which were staving off famine and making it\r\npossible for the nation to endure. Every conceivable obstacle was placed in\r\nthe way of the National Union of Zemstvos and the Union of Cities; the\r\nco-operative associations, which were rendering valuable service in meeting\r\nthe distress of working-men's families, were obstructed and restricted in\r\nevery possible way, their national offices being closed by the police. The\r\nofficials of the labor-unions who were co-operating with employers in\r\nsubstituting arbitration in place of strikes, establishing soup-kitchens\r\nand relief funds, and doing other similar work to keep the nation alive,\r\nwere singled out for arrest and imprisonment. The Black Hundreds were\r\nperniciously active in all this oppression and in the treacherous advocacy\r\nof a separate peace with Germany.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1916, a conference of chairmen of province zemstvos adopted and\r\npublished a resolution which declared:\r\n\r\n    The tormenting and horrifying suspicion, the sinister rumors of\r\n    perfidy and treason, of dark forces working in favor of Germany to\r\n    destroy the unity of the nation, to sow discord and thus prepare\r\n    conditions for an ignominious peace, have now reached the clear\r\n    certainty that the hand of the enemy secretly influences the\r\n    affairs of our state.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nAn adequate comprehension of the things set forth in this terrible summary\r\nis of the highest importance to every one who would attempt the task of\r\nreaching an intelligent understanding of the mighty upheaval in Russia and\r\nits far-reaching consequences. The Russian Revolution of 1917 was not\r\nresponsible for the disastrous separate peace with Germany. The foundations\r\nfor that were laid by the reactionaries of the old régime. It was the\r\nlogical outcome of their long-continued efforts. Lenine, Trotzky, and their\r\nBolshevist associates were mere puppets, simple tools whose visions,\r\nambitions, and schemes became the channels through which the conspiracy of\r\nthe worst reactionaries in Russia realized one part of an iniquitous\r\nprogram.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution itself was a genuine and sincere effort on the part of the\r\nRussian people to avert the disaster and shame of a separate peace; to\r\nserve the Allied cause with all the fidelity of which they were capable.\r\nThere would have been a separate peace if the old régime had remained in\r\npower a few weeks longer and the Revolution been averted. It is most likely\r\nthat it would have been a more shameful peace than was concluded at\r\nBrest-Litovsk, and that it would have resulted in an actual and active\r\nalliance of the Romanov dynasty with the dynasties of the Hohenzollerns and\r\nthe Habsburgs. The Russian Revolution of 1917 had this great merit: it so\r\ndelayed the separate peace between Russia and Germany that the Allies were\r\nable to prepare for it. It had the merit, also, that it forced the\r\nattainment of the separate peace to come in such a manner as to reduce\r\nGermany's military gain on the western front to a minimum.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the Bolsheviki in their wild, groping, and frenzied\r\nefforts to apply theoretical abstractions to the living world, torn as it\r\nwas by the wolves of war, famine, treason, oppression, and despair, served\r\nthe foes of freedom and progress must not be lost sight of. The Bolshevist,\r\nwherever he may present himself, is the foe of progress and the ally of\r\nreaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND REVOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nWhen the Duma assembled On November 14, 1916--new style--the approaching\r\ndoom of Czar Nicholas II was already manifest. Why the Revolution did not\r\noccur at that time is a puzzle not easy to solve. Perhaps the mere fact\r\nthat the Duma was assembling served to postpone resort to drastic measures.\r\nThe nation waited for the Duma to lead. It is probable, also, that fear\r\nlest revolution prove disastrous to the military forces exercised a\r\nrestraining influence upon the people. Certain it is that it would have\r\nbeen easy enough to kindle the fires of revolution at that time. Never in\r\nthe history of the nation, not even in 1905, were conditions riper for\r\nrevolt, and never had there been a more solid array of the nation against\r\nthe bureaucracy. Discontent and revolutionary temper were not confined to\r\nSocialists, nor to the lower classes. Landowners, capitalists, military\r\nofficials, and Intellectuals were united with the peasants and artisans, to\r\nan even greater extent than in the early stages of the First Revolution.\r\nConservatives and Moderates joined with Social Democrats and\r\nSocialist-Revolutionists in opposition to the corrupt and oppressive\r\nrégime. Even the president of the Duma, Michael Rodzianko, a conservative\r\nlandowner, assailed the government.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal reasons for this unexampled unity against the\r\ngovernment was the wide-spread conviction, based, as we have seen, upon the\r\nmost damning evidence, that Premier Sturmer and his Cabinet were not loyal\r\nto the Allies and that they contemplated making a separate peace with\r\nGermany. All factions in the Duma were bitterly opposed to a separate\r\npeace. Rodzianko was loudly cheered when he denounced the intrigues against\r\nthe Allies and declared: \"Russia gave her word to fight in common with the\r\nAllies till complete and final victory is won. Russia will not betray her\r\nfriends, and with contempt refuses any consideration of a separate peace.\r\nRussia will not be a traitor to those who are fighting side by side with\r\nher sons for a great and just cause.\" Notwithstanding the intensification\r\nof the class conflict naturally resulting from the great industrial\r\ndevelopment since 1906, patriotism temporarily overshadowed all class\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\nThe cheers that greeted Rodzianko's declaration, and the remarkable ovation\r\nto the Allied ambassadors, who were present, amply demonstrated that, in\r\nspite of the frightful suffering and sacrifice which the nation had\r\nendured, all classes were united in their determination to win the war.\r\nOnly a corrupt section of the bureaucracy, at one end of the social scale,\r\nand a small section of extreme left-wing Socialists, at the other end of\r\nthe social scale, were at that time anti-war. There was this difference\r\nbetween the Socialist pacifists and the bureaucratic advocates of peace\r\nwith Germany: the former were not pro-German nor anti-Ally, but sincere\r\ninternationalists, honest and brave--however mistaken--advocates of peace.\r\nOutside of the bureaucracy there was no hostility to the Allies in Russia.\r\nExcept for the insignificant Socialist minority referred to, the masses of\r\nthe Russian people realized that the defeat of the Hohenzollern dynasty\r\nwas necessary to a realization of the ideal of a free Russia. The new and\r\ngreater revolution was already beginning, and determination to defeat the\r\nHohenzollern bulwark of the Romanov despotism was almost universal. The\r\nwhole nation was pervaded by this spirit.\r\n\r\nPaul Miliukov, leader of the Constitutional Democrats, popularly known as\r\nthe \"Cadets,\" furiously lashed Premier Sturmer and quoted the irrefutable\r\nevidence of his pro-Germanism and of his corruption. Sturmer reeled under\r\nthe smashing attack. In his rage he forbade the publication of Miliukov's\r\nspeech, but hundreds of thousands of copies of it were secretly printed and\r\ndistributed. Every one recognized that there was war between the Duma and\r\nthe government, and notwithstanding the criticism of the Socialists, who\r\nnaturally regarded it as a bourgeois body, the Duma represented Russia.\r\n\r\nSturmer proposed to his Cabinet the dissolution of the Duma, but failed to\r\nobtain the support of a majority. Then he determined to get the Czar's\r\nsignature to a decree of dissolution. But the Czar was at the General\r\nHeadquarters of the army at the time and therefore surrounded by army\r\nofficers, practically all of whom were with the Duma and inspired by a\r\nbitter resentment of the pro-German intrigues, especially the neglect of\r\nthe army organization. The weak will of Nicholas II was thus beyond the\r\nreach of Sturmer's influence for the time being. Meanwhile, the Ministers\r\nof the Army and Navy had appeared before the Duma and declared themselves\r\nto be on the side of the people and their parliament. On his way to visit\r\nthe Czar at General Headquarters, Premier Sturmer was met by one of the\r\nCzar's messengers and handed his dismissal from office. The Duma had won.\r\n\r\nThe evil genius which inspired and controlled him led Nicholas II to\r\nappoint as Sturmer's successor the utterly reactionary bureaucrat,\r\nAlexander Trepov, and to retain in office as Minister of the Interior the\r\ninfamous Protopopov, associate of the unsavory Rasputin. When Trepov made\r\nhis first appearance as Premier in the Duma he was loudly hissed by the\r\nSocialists. Other factions, while not concealing their disappointment, were\r\nmore tolerant and even became more hopeful when they realized that from the\r\nfirst Trepov was fighting to oust Protopopov. That meant, of course, a\r\nfight against Rasputin as well. Whatever Trepov's motives might be in\r\nfighting Protopopov and Rasputin he was helping the opposition. But Trepov\r\nwas no match for such opponents. It soon became evident that as Premier he\r\nwas a mere figurehead and that Rasputin and Protopopov held the government\r\nin their hands. Protopopov openly defied the Premier and the Duma.\r\n\r\nIn December it began to be rumored in political circles that Sturmer, who\r\nwas now attached in some not clearly defined capacity to the Foreign\r\nOffice, was about to be sent to a neutral country as ambassador. The rumor\r\ncreated the utmost consternation in liberal circles in Russia and in the\r\nAllied embassies. If true, it could only have one meaning, namely, that\r\narrangements were being made to negotiate a separate peace with\r\nGermany--and that meant that Russia was to become Germany's economic\r\nvassal.\r\n\r\nThe Duma demanded a responsible Ministry, a Cabinet directly responsible\r\nto, and controlled by, the Duma as the people's representative. This demand\r\nhad been constantly made since the First Revolution. Even the Imperial\r\nCouncil, upon which the Czar had always been able to rely for support\r\nagainst revolutionary movements, now joined forces with the Duma in making\r\nthis demand. That traditionally reactionary, bureaucratic body, composed\r\nof former Premiers, Cabinet Ministers, and other high officials, formally\r\ndemanded that the Czar take steps to make the government responsible to the\r\npopularly elected assemblage. This was a small revolution in itself. The\r\nfabric of Czarism had cracked.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt in the mind of any student of Russian affairs that\r\nthe unity of the Imperial Council and the Duma, like the unity of classes,\r\nwas due to the strong pro-Ally sentiment which at that time possessed\r\npractically the entire nation. On December 12th--new style--Germany offered\r\nRussia a separate peace, and three days later the Foreign Minister,\r\nPokrovsky, visited the Duma and announced that Russia would reject the\r\noffer. The Duma immediately passed a resolution declaring that \"the Duma\r\nunanimously favors a categorical refusal by the Allied governments to\r\nenter, under present conditions, into any peace negotiations whatever.\" On\r\nthe 19th a similar resolution was adopted by the Imperial Council, which\r\ncontinued to follow the leadership of the Duma. Before adjourning for the\r\nChristmas holidays the Duma passed another resolution, aimed chiefly at\r\nProtopopov and Sturmer, protesting against the sinister activities which\r\nwere undermining the war-making forces of the nation, and praising the work\r\nof the zemstvos and working-class organizations which had struggled bravely\r\nto sustain the army, feed the people, care for the sick and wounded, and\r\navert utter chaos.\r\n\r\nOn December 30th, in the early hours of the morning, the monk Rasputin was\r\nmurdered and his body thrown into the Neva. The strangest and most evil of\r\nall the actors in the Russian drama was dead, but the system which made\r\nhim what he was lived. Rasputin dead exercised upon the diseased mind of\r\nthe Czarina--and, through her, upon the Czar--even a greater influence than\r\nwhen he was alive. Nicholas II was as powerless to resist the insane\r\nCzarina's influence as he had proved himself to be when he banished the\r\nGrand-Duke Nicholas for pointing out that the Czarina was the tool of evil\r\nand crafty intriguers. Heedless of the warning implied in the murder of\r\nRasputin, and of the ever-growing opposition to the government and the\r\nthrone, the Czar inaugurated, or permitted to be inaugurated, new measures\r\nof reaction and repression.\r\n\r\nTrepov was driven from the Premiership and replaced by Prince Golitizin, a\r\nbureaucrat of small brain and less conscience. The best Minister of\r\nEducation Russia had ever had, Ignatyev, was replaced by one of the\r\nblackest of all reactionaries. The Czar celebrated the New-Year by issuing\r\nan edict retiring the progressive members of the Imperial Council, who had\r\nsupported the Duma, and appointing in their stead the most reactionary men\r\nhe could find in the Empire. At the head of the Council as president he\r\nplaced the notorious Jew-hating Stcheglovitov. As always, hatred of the Jew\r\nsprang from fear of progress.\r\n\r\nAs one reads the history of January, 1917, in Russia, as it was reported in\r\nthe press day by day, and the numerous accounts of competent and\r\ntrustworthy observers, it is difficult to resist the conclusion that\r\nProtopopov deliberately sought to precipitate a revolution. Mad as this\r\nhypothesis seems to be, it is nevertheless the only one which affords a\r\nrational explanation of the policy of the government. No sooner was\r\nGolitizin made Premier than it was announced that the opening of the Duma\r\nwould be postponed till the end of January, in order that the Cabinet\r\nmight be reorganized. Later it was announced that the Duma opening would be\r\nagain postponed--this time till the end of February. In the reorganization\r\nof the Cabinet, Shuvaviev, the War Minister, who had loyally co-operated\r\nwith the zemstvos and had supported the Duma in November, was dismissed.\r\nPokrovsky, the Foreign Minister, who had announced to the Duma in December\r\nthe rejection of the German peace offer, was reported to be \"sick\" and\r\ngiven \"leave of absence.\" Other changes were made in the Cabinet, in every\r\ncase to the advantage of the reactionaries. It was practically impossible\r\nfor anyone in Russia to find out who the Ministers of the government were.\r\n\r\nProtopopov released Sukhomlinov, the former Minister of War who had been\r\njustly convicted of treason. This action, taken, it was said, at the\r\ndirection of the Czarina, added to the already wide-spread belief that the\r\ngovernment was animated by a desire to make peace with Germany. That the\r\nCzar himself was loyal to the Allies was generally believed, but there was\r\nno such belief in the loyalty of Protopopov, Sturmer, and their associates.\r\nThe nation meantime was drifting into despair and anarchy. The railway\r\nsystem was deliberately permitted to become disorganized. Hunger reigned in\r\nthe cities and the food reserves for the army were deliberately reduced to\r\na two days' supply. The terror of hunger spread through the large cities\r\nand through the army at the front like prairie fire.\r\n\r\nIt became evident that Protopopov was carrying out the plans of the\r\nGermanophiles, deliberately trying to disorganize the life of the nation\r\nand make successful warfare impossible. Socialists and labor leaders\r\ncharged that his agents were encouraging the pacifist minority and opposing\r\nthe patriotic majority among the workers. The work of the War Industries\r\nCommittee which controlled organizations engaged in the manufacture of\r\nwar-supplies which employed hundreds of thousands of workers was hampered\r\nin every way. It is the testimony of the best-known and most-trusted\r\nworking-class leaders in Russia that the vast majority of the workers,\r\nwhile anxious for a general democratic peace, were opposed to a separate\r\npeace with Germany and favored the continuation of the war against\r\nPrussianism and the co-operation of all classes to that end. The pacifists\r\nand \"defeatist\" Socialists represented a minority. To the minority every\r\npossible assistance was given, while the leaders of the working class who\r\nwere loyal to the war, and who sought to sustain the morale of the workers\r\nin support of the war, were opposed and thwarted in their efforts and, in\r\nmany cases, cast into prison. The Black Hundreds were still at work.\r\n\r\nSocialist leaders of the working class issued numerous appeals to the\r\nworkers, warning them that Protopopov's secret police agitators were trying\r\nto bring about strikes, and begging them not to lend themselves to such\r\ntreacherous designs, which could only aid Germany at the expense of\r\ndemocracy in Russia and elsewhere. It became known, too, that large numbers\r\nof machine-guns were being distributed among the police in Petrograd and\r\nplaced at strategic points throughout the city. It was said that Protopopov\r\nwas mad, but it was the methodical madness of a desperate, reactionary,\r\nautocratic régime.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nProtopopov and Sturmer and their associates recognized as clearly as the\r\nliberals did the natural kinship and interdependence of the three great\r\nautocracies, the Romanov, Habsburg, and Hohenzollern dynasties. They knew\r\nwell that the crushing of autocracy in Austria-Hungary and Germany would\r\nmake it impossible to maintain autocracy in Russia. They realized,\r\nfurthermore, that while the nation was not willing to attempt revolution\r\nduring the war, the end of the war would inevitably bring with it\r\nrevolution upon a scale far vaster than had ever been attempted before,\r\nunless, indeed, the revolutionary leaders could be goaded into making a\r\npremature attempt to overthrow the monarchy. In that case, it might be\r\npossible to crush them. Given a rebellion in the cities, which could be\r\ncrushed by the police amply provided with machine-guns, and by \"loyal\"\r\ntroops, with a vast army unprovided with food and no means of supplying it,\r\nthere would be abundant justification for making a separate peace with\r\nGermany. Thus the Revolution would be crushed and the whole system of\r\nautocracy, Russian, Austrian, and German, preserved.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the 27th of February--new style--was tense with an ominous\r\nexpectancy. In the Allied chancelleries anxious groups were gathered. They\r\nrealized that the fate of the Allies hung in the balance. In Petrograd\r\nalone three hundred thousand workers went out on strike that day, and the\r\npolice agents did their level best to provoke violence. The large bodies of\r\ntroops massed at various points throughout the city, and the police with\r\ntheir machine-guns, testified to the thoroughness with which the government\r\nhad prepared to crush any revolutionary manifestations. Thanks to the\r\nexcellent discipline of the workers, and the fine wisdom of the leaders of\r\nthe Social Democrats, the Socialist-Revolutionists, and the Labor Group,\r\nwho constantly exhorted the workers not to fall into the trap set for them,\r\nthere was no violence.\r\n\r\nAt the opening session of the Duma, Kerensky, leader of the Labor Group,\r\nmade a characteristic address in which he denounced the arrest of the Labor\r\nGroup members of the War Industries Committee. He directed his attack\r\nagainst the \"system,\" not against individuals:\r\n\r\n\"We are living in a state of anarchy unprecedented in our history. In\r\ncomparison with it the period of 1613 seems like child's play. Chaos has\r\nenveloped not only the political, but the economic life of the nation as\r\nwell. It destroys the very foundations of the nation's social economic\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\n\"Things have come to such a pass that recently one of the Ministries,\r\nshipping coal from Petrograd to a neighboring city, had armed the train\r\nwith a special guard so that other authorities should not confiscate the\r\ncoal on the way! We have arrived already at the primitive stage when each\r\nperson defends with all the resources at his command the material in his\r\npossession, ready to enter into mortal combat for it with his neighbor. We\r\nare witnessing the same scenes which France went through at the time of the\r\nRevolution. Then also the products shipped to Paris were accompanied by\r\nspecial detachments of troops to prevent their being seized by the\r\nprovincial authorities....\r\n\r\n\"Behold the Cabinet of Rittich-Protopopov-Golitizin dragging into the court\r\nthe Labor Group of the War Industries Committee, charged with aiming at the\r\ncreation of a Russian Social-Democratic republic! They did not even know\r\nthat nobody aims at a 'Social-Democratic' republic. One aiming at a\r\nrepublic labors for popular government. But has the court anything to say\r\nabout all these distinctions? We know beforehand what sentences are to be\r\nimposed upon the prisoners....\r\n\r\n\"I have no desire to criticize the individual members of the Cabinet. The\r\ngreatest mistake of all is to seek traitors, German agents, separate\r\nSturmers. _We have a still greater enemy than the German influence, than\r\nthe treachery and treason of individuals. And that enemy is the system--the\r\nsystem of a medieval form of government_.\"\r\n\r\nHow far the conspiracy of the government of Russia against the war of\r\nRussia and her Allies extended is shown by the revelations made in the Duma\r\non March 3d by one of the members, A. Konovalov. He reported that two days\r\npreviously, March 1st, the only two members of the Labor Group of the War\r\nIndustries Committee who were not in prison issued an appeal to the workers\r\nnot to strike. These two members of the Labor Group of the War Industries\r\nCommittee, Anosovsky and Ostapenko, took their exhortation to the bureau of\r\nthe War Industries Committee for its approval. But, although approved by\r\nthis great and important organization, the appeal was not passed by the\r\ngovernment censor. When Guchkov, president of the War Industries Committee,\r\nattempted to get the appeal printed in the newspapers he was prevented by\r\naction emanating from the office of Protopopov.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThrough all the early days of March there was labor unrest in Petrograd, as\r\nwell as in some other cities. Petrograd was, naturally, the storm center.\r\nThere were small strikes, but, fortunately, not much rioting. The extreme\r\nradicals were agitating for the release of the imprisoned leaders of the\r\nLabor Group and urging drastic action by the workers. Much of this\r\nagitation was sincere and honest, but no little of it was due to the\r\nprovocative agents. These, disguised as workmen, seized every opportunity\r\nto urge revolt. Any pretext sufficed them; they stimulated the honest\r\nagitation to revolt as a protest against the imprisonment of the Labor\r\nGroup, and the desperate threat that unless food was forthcoming revolution\r\nwould be resorted to for sinister purposes. And all the time the police and\r\nthe troops were massed to crush the first rising.\r\n\r\nThe next few days were destined to reveal the fact that the cunning and\r\nguile of Protopopov had overreached itself; that the soldiers could not be\r\nrelied upon to crush any uprising of the people. There was some rioting in\r\nPetrograd on March 3d, and the next day the city was placed under martial\r\nlaw. On March 7th the textile workers went out on strike and were quickly\r\nfollowed by several thousand workers belonging to other trades. Next day\r\nthere was a tremendous popular demonstration at which the workers demanded\r\nfood. The strike spread during the next two or three days until there was a\r\npretty general stoppage of industry. Students from the university joined\r\nwith the striking workmen and there were numerous demonstrations, but\r\nlittle disposition to violence. When the Cossacks and mounted police were\r\nsent to break up the crowds, the Cossacks took great care not to hurt the\r\npeople, fraternizing with them and being cheered by them. It was evident\r\nthat the army would not let itself be used to crush the uprising of the\r\npeople. The police remained \"loyal,\" but they were not adequate in numbers.\r\nProtopopov had set in motion forces which no human agency could control.\r\nThe Revolution was well under way.\r\n\r\nThe Duma remained in constant session. Meantime the situation in the\r\ncapital was becoming serious in the extreme. Looting of stores began, and\r\nthere were many victims of the police efforts to disperse the crowds. In\r\nthe midst of the crisis the Duma repudiated the government and broke off\r\nall relations with it. The resolution of the Duma declared that \"The\r\ngovernment which covered its hands with the blood of the people should no\r\nlonger be admitted to the Duma. With such a government the Duma breaks all\r\nrelations forever.\" The answer of Czar Nicholas was an order to dissolve\r\nthe Duma, which order the Duma voted to ignore, remaining in session as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, March 11th, there was a great outpouring of people at a\r\ndemonstration. Police established on the roofs of some public buildings\r\nattacked the closely packed throngs with machine-gun fire, killing and\r\nwounding hundreds. One of the famous regiments, the Volynski, revolted,\r\nkilled its commander, and joined the people when ordered to fire into the\r\ncrowds. Detachments of soldiers belonging to other regiments followed their\r\nexample and refused to fire upon the people. One or two detachments of\r\ntroops did obey orders and were immediately attacked by the revolutionary\r\ntroops. There was civil war in Petrograd.\r\n\r\nWhile the fighting was still going on, the president of the Duma sent the\r\nfollowing telegram to the Czar:\r\n\r\n    The situation is grave. Anarchy reigns in the capital. The\r\n    government is paralyzed. The transport of provisions and fuel is\r\n    completely disorganized. General dissatisfaction is growing.\r\n    Irregular rifle-firing is occurring in the streets. It is\r\n    necessary to charge immediately some person enjoying the\r\n    confidence of the people to form a new government. It is\r\n    impossible to linger. Any delay means death. Let us pray to God\r\n    that the responsibility in this hour will not fall upon a crowned\r\n    head.\r\n\r\n    RODZIANKO.\r\n\r\nThe Duma waited in vain that night for an answer from the Czar. The\r\nbourgeois elements in the Duma were terrified. Only the leaders of the\r\ndifferent Socialist groups appeared to possess any idea of providing the\r\nrevolutionary movement with proper direction. While the leaders of the\r\nbourgeois groups were proclaiming their conviction that the Revolution\r\nwould be crushed in a few hours by the tens of thousands of troops in\r\nPetrograd who had not yet rebelled, the Socialist leaders were busy\r\npreparing plans to carry on the struggle. Even those Social Democrats who\r\nfor various reasons had most earnestly tried to avert the Revolution gave\r\nthemselves with whole-hearted enthusiasm to the task of organizing the\r\nrevolutionary forces. Following the example set in the 1905 Revolution,\r\nthere had been formed a central committee of the working-class\r\norganizations to direct the movement. This body, composed of elected\r\nrepresentatives of the unions and Socialist societies, was later known as\r\nthe Council of Workmen's Deputies. It was this body which undertook the\r\norganization of the Revolution. This Revolution, unlike that of 1905, was\r\ninitiated by the bourgeoisie, but its originators manifested little desire\r\nand less capacity to lead it.\r\n\r\nWhen Monday morning came there was no longer an unorganized, planless mass\r\nconfusedly opposing a carefully organized force, but a compact,\r\nwell-organized, and skilfully led movement. Processions were formed, each\r\nunder responsible directors with very definite instructions. As on the\r\nprevious day, the police stationed upon roofs of buildings, and at various\r\nstrategic points, fired upon the people. As on the previous day, also, the\r\nsoldiers joined the Revolution and refused to shoot the people. The famous\r\nGuards' Regiment, long the pet and pride of the Czar, was the first to\r\nrebel. The soldiers killed the officer who ordered them to fire, and then\r\nwith cheers joined the rebels. When the military authorities sent out\r\nanother regiment to suppress the rebel Guards' Regiment they saw the new\r\nforce go over to the Revolution in a body. Other regiments deserted in the\r\nsame manner. The flower of the Russian army had joined the people in\r\nrevolting against the Czar and the system of Czarism.\r\n\r\nOn the side of the revolutionists were now many thousands of well-trained\r\nsoldiers, fully armed. Soon they took possession of the Arsenal, after\r\nkilling the commander. The soldiers made organized and systematic warfare\r\nupon the police. Every policeman seen was shot down, police stations were\r\nset on fire, and prisons were broken open and the prisoners released. The\r\nnumerous political prisoners were triumphantly liberated and took their\r\nplaces in the revolutionary ranks. In rapid succession the great bastiles\r\nfell! Peter and Paul Fortress, scene of infinite martyrdom, fell into the\r\nhands of the revolutionary forces, and the prisoners, many of them heroes\r\nand martyrs of other uprisings, were set free amid frenzied cheering. The\r\ngreat Schlüsselburg Fortress was likewise seized and emptied. With\r\ntwenty-five thousand armed troops on their side, the revolutionists were\r\npractically masters of the capital. They attacked the headquarters of the\r\nhated Secret Service and made a vast, significantly symbolical bonfire of\r\nits archives.\r\n\r\nOnce more Rodzianko appealed to the Czar. It is no reflection upon\r\nRodzianko's honesty, or upon his loyalty to the people, to say that he was\r\nappalled by the development of the struggle. He sympathized with the people\r\nin their demand for political democracy and would wage war to the end upon\r\nCzarism, but he feared the effect of the Revolution upon the army and the\r\nAllied cause. Moreover, he was a landowner, and he feared Socialism. In\r\n1906 he had joined forces with the government when the Socialists led the\r\nmasses--and now the Socialist leaders were again at the head of the masses.\r\nPerhaps the result would have been otherwise if the Duma had followed up\r\nits repudiation of the government by openly and unreservedly placing itself\r\nat the head of the uprising. In any other country than Russia that would\r\nhave been done, in all probability, but the Russian bourgeoisie was weak.\r\nThis was due, like so much else in Russia, to the backwardness of the\r\nindustrial system. There was not a strong middle class and, therefore, the\r\nbourgeoisie left the fighting to the working class. Rodzianko's new appeal\r\nto the Czar was pathetic. When hundreds of dead and dying lay in the\r\nstreets and in churches, hospitals, and other public buildings, he could\r\nstill imagine that the Czar could save the situation: \"The situation is\r\ngrowing worse. It is necessary to take measures immediately, for to-morrow\r\nit will be too late,\" he telegraphed. \"The last hour has struck to decide\r\nthe fate of the country and of the dynasty.\" Poor, short-sighted bourgeois!\r\nIt was already \"too late\" for \"measures\" by the weak-minded Nicholas II to\r\navail. The \"fate of the country and of the dynasty\" was already determined!\r\nIt was just as well that the Czar did not make any reply to the message.\r\n\r\nThe new ruler of Russia, King Demos, was speaking now. Workers and soldiers\r\nsent deputations to the Taurida Palace, where the Duma was sitting.\r\nRodzianko read to them the message he had sent to the Czar, but that was\r\nsmall comfort. Thousands of revolutionists, civilian and military, stormed\r\nthe Taurida Palace and clamored to hear what the Socialists in the Duma had\r\nto say. In response to this demand Tchcheidze, Kerensky, Skobelev, and\r\nother Socialists from various groups appeared and addressed the people.\r\nThese men had a message to give; they understood the ferment and were part\r\nof it. They were of the Revolution--bone of its bone, flesh of its flesh,\r\nand so they were cheered again and again. And what a triumvirate they made,\r\nthese leaders of the people! Tchcheidze, once a university professor, keen,\r\ncool, and as witty as George Bernard Shaw, listened to with the deference\r\ndemocracy always pays to intellect.\r\n\r\nKerensky, lawyer by profession, matchless as an orator, obviously the\r\nprophet and inspirer rather than the executive type; Skobelev, blunt,\r\ndirect, and practical, a man little given to romantic illusions. It was\r\nSkobelev who made the announcement to the crowd outside the Taurida Palace\r\nthat the old system was ended forever and that the Duma would create a\r\nProvisional Committee. He begged the workers and the soldiers to keep\r\norder, to refrain from violence against individuals, and to observe strict\r\ndiscipline. \"Freedom demands discipline and order,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon the Duma selected a temporary committee to restore order.\r\nThe committee, called the Duma Committee of Safety, consisted of twelve\r\nmembers, representing all the parties and groups in the Duma. The hastily\r\nformed committee of the workers met and decided to call on the workmen to\r\nhold immediate elections for the Council of Workmen's Deputies--the first\r\nmeeting of which was to be held that evening. That this was a perilous\r\nthing to do the history of the First Revolution clearly showed, but no\r\nother course seemed open to the workers, in view of the attitude of the\r\nbourgeoisie. On behalf of the Duma Committee, Rodzianko issued the\r\nfollowing proclamation:\r\n\r\n    The Provisional Committee of the members of the Imperial Duma,\r\n    aware of the grave conditions of internal disorder created by the\r\n    measure of the old government, has found itself compelled to take\r\n    into its hands the re-establishment of political and civil order.\r\n    In full consciousness of the responsibility of its decision, the\r\n    Provisional Committee expresses its trust that the population and\r\n    the army will help it in the difficult task of creating a new\r\n    government which will comply with the wishes of the population,\r\n    and be able to enjoy its confidence.\r\n\r\n    MICHAIL RODZIANKO, _Speaker of the Imperial Duma_.\r\n    February 27, 1917.[4]\r\n\r\nThat night the first formal session of the Council of Workmen's Deputies\r\nwas held. Tchcheidze was elected president, Kerensky vice-president. The\r\ndeputies had been elected by the working-men of many factories and by the\r\nmembers of Socialist organizations. It was not until the following day that\r\nsoldiers' representatives were added and the words \"and Soldiers\" added to\r\nthe title of the Council. At this first meeting the Council--a most\r\nmoderate and capable body--called for a Constituent Assembly on the basis\r\nof equal, direct, and secret universal suffrage. This demand was contained\r\nin an address to the people which read, in part:\r\n\r\n    To finish the struggle successfully in the interests of democracy,\r\n    the people must create their own powerful organization.\r\n\r\n    The Council of the Workmen's Deputies, holding its session in the\r\n    Imperial Duma, makes it its supreme task to organize the people's\r\n    forces and their struggle for a final securing of political\r\n    freedom and popular government in Russia.\r\n\r\n    We appeal to the entire population of the capital to rally around\r\n    the Council, to form local committees in the various boroughs, and\r\n    to take over the management of local affairs.\r\n\r\n    All together, with united forces, we will struggle for a final\r\n    abolition of the old system and the calling of a Constituent\r\n    Assembly on the basis of universal, equal, direct, and secret\r\n    suffrage.\r\n\r\nThis document is of the highest historical importance and merits close\r\nstudy. As already noted, Tchcheidze, leader of the Mensheviki, was\r\npresident of the Council, and this appeal to the people shows how fully the\r\nmoderate views of his group prevailed. Indeed, the manner in which the\r\nmoderate counsels of the Mensheviki dominated the Council at a time of\r\ngreat excitement and passion, when extremists might have been expected to\r\nobtain the lead, is one of the most remarkable features of the whole story\r\nof the Second Russian Revolution. It appeared at this time that the\r\nRussian proletariat had fully learned the tragic lessons of 1905-06.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the text of the appeal that at the time the Council\r\nlooked upon the Revolution as being primarily a political event, not as a\r\nmovement to reconstruct the economic and social system. There is no\r\nreference to social democracy. Even the land question is not referred to.\r\nHow limited their purpose was at the moment may be gathered from the\r\nstatement, \"The Council ... makes it its supreme task to organize the\r\npeople's forces and their struggle for a final securing of political\r\nfreedom and popular government.\" It is also clearly evident that,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that the Council itself was a working-class\r\norganization, a manifestation of the class consciousness of the workers,\r\nthe leaders of the Council did not regard the Revolution as a proletarian\r\nevent, nor doubt the necessity of co-operation on the part of all classes.\r\nProletarian exclusiveness came later, but on March 13th the appeal of the\r\nCouncil was \"to the entire population.\"\r\n\r\nMarch 14th saw the arrest of many of the leading reactionaries, including\r\nProtopopov and the traitor Sukhomlinov, and an approach to order. All that\r\nday the representatives of the Duma and the representatives of the Council\r\nof Workmen's and Soldiers' Deputies, as it was now called, embryo of the\r\nfirst Soviet government, tried to reach an agreement concerning the future\r\norganization of Russia. The representatives of the Duma were pitifully\r\nlacking in comprehension of the situation. They wanted the Czar deposed,\r\nbut the monarchy itself retained, subject to constitutional limitations\r\nanalogous to those obtaining in England. They wanted the Romanov dynasty\r\nretained, their choice being the Czar's brother, Grand-Duke Michael. The\r\nrepresentatives of the Soviet, on the other hand, would not tolerate the\r\nsuggestion that the monarchy be continued. Standing, as yet, only for\r\npolitical democracy, they insisted that the monarchy must be abolished and\r\nthat the new government be republican in form. The statesmanship and\r\npolitical skill of these representatives of the workers were immeasurably\r\nsuperior to those possessed by the bourgeois representatives of the Duma.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThursday, March 15, 1917--new style--was one of the most fateful and\r\nmomentous days in the history of mankind. It will always be remembered as\r\nthe day on which Czarism ceased to exist in Russia. At three o'clock in the\r\nafternoon Miliukov, leader of the Constitutional Democrats, appeared in\r\nfront of the Taurida Palace and announced to the waiting throngs that an\r\nagreement had been reached between the Duma and the Council of Workmen's\r\nand Soldiers' Deputies; that it had been decided to depose the Czar, to\r\nconstitute immediately a Provisional Government composed of representatives\r\nof all parties and groups, and to proceed with arrangements for the holding\r\nof a Constituent Assembly at an early date to determine the form of a\r\npermanent democratic government for Russia.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the Provisional Government, as Premier, had been placed\r\nPrince George E. Lvov, who as president of the Union of Zemstvos had proved\r\nhimself to be a democrat of the most liberal school as well as an\r\nextraordinarily capable organizer. The position of Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs was given to Miliukov, whose strong sympathy with the Allies was\r\nwell known. The position of Minister of Justice was given to Alexander\r\nKerensky, one of the most extraordinary men in Russia, a leader of the\r\nGroup of Toil, a party of peasant Socialists, vice-president of the Council\r\nof Workmen's and Soldiers' Deputies. At the head of the War Department was\r\nplaced Alexander Guchkov, a soldier-politician, leader of the Octobrist\r\nparty, who had turned against the First Revolution in 1905, when it became\r\nan economic war of the classes, evoking thereby the hatred of the\r\nSocialists, but who as head of the War Industries Committee had achieved\r\ntruly wonderful results in the present war in face of the opposition of the\r\ngovernment. The pressing food problem was placed in the hands of Andrei\r\nShingarev. As Minister of Agriculture Shingarev belonged to the radical\r\nleft wing of the Cadets.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that the composition of the Provisional Government was\r\nreceived with popular satisfaction. It was top-heavy with representatives\r\nof the bourgeoisie. There was only one Socialist, Kerensky. Miliukov's\r\nselection, inevitable though it was, and great as his gifts were, was\r\ncondemned by the radical working-men because he was regarded as a dangerous\r\n\"imperialist\" on account of his advocacy of the annexation of\r\nConstantinople. Guchkov's inclusion was equally unpopular on account of his\r\nrecord at the time of the First Revolution. The most popular selection was\r\nundoubtedly Kerensky, because he represented more nearly than any of the\r\nothers the aspirations of the masses. As a whole, it was the fact that the\r\nProvisional Government was too fully representative of the bourgeois\r\nparties and groups which gave the Bolsheviki and other radicals a chance to\r\ncondemn it.\r\n\r\nThe absence of the name of Tchcheidze from the list was a surprise and a\r\ndisappointment to most of the moderate Socialists, for he had come to be\r\nregarded as one of the most capable and trustworthy leaders of the masses.\r\nThe fact that he was not included in the new government could hardly fail\r\nto cause uneasy suspicion. It was said later that efforts had been made to\r\ninduce him to join the new government, but that he declined to do so.\r\nTchcheidze's position was a very difficult one. Thoroughly in sympathy with\r\nthe plan to form a coalition Provisional Government, and supporting\r\nKerensky in his position, Tchcheidze nevertheless declined to enter the new\r\nCabinet himself. In this he was quite honest and not at all the tricky\r\npolitician he has been represented as being.\r\n\r\nTchcheidze knew that the Duma had been elected upon a most undemocratic\r\nsuffrage and that it did not and could not represent the masses of the\r\npeasants and wage-workers. These classes were represented in the Council of\r\nWorkmen's and Soldiers' Deputies, which continued to exist as a separate\r\nbody, independent of the Duma, but co-operating with it as an equal. From a\r\nSocialist point of view it would have been a mistake to disband the\r\nCouncil, Tchcheidze believed. He saw Soviet government as the need of the\r\ncritical moment, rather than as the permanent, distinctive type of Russian\r\nSocial democracy as the critics of Kerensky have alleged.\r\n\r\nWhile the Provisional Government was being created, the Czar, at General\r\nHeadquarters, was being forced to recognize the bitter fact that the\r\nRomanov dynasty could no longer live. When he could no more resist the\r\npressure brought to bear upon him by the representatives of the Duma, he\r\nwrote and signed a formal instrument of abdication of the Russian throne,\r\nnaming his brother, Grand-Duke Michael, as his successor. The latter dared\r\nnot attempt to assume the imperial rôle. He recognized that the end of\r\nautocracy had been reached and declined to accept the throne unless chosen\r\nby a popular referendum vote. On March 16th, the day after the abdication\r\nof Nicholas II, Michael issued a statement in which he said:\r\n\r\n    This heavy responsibility has come to me at the voluntary request\r\n    of my brother, who has transferred the Imperial throne to me\r\n    during a time of warfare which is accompanied by unprecedented\r\n    popular disturbances.\r\n\r\n    Moved by the thought, which is in the minds of the entire people,\r\n    that the good of the country is paramount, I have adopted the firm\r\n    resolution to accept the supreme power only if this be the will of\r\n    our great people, who, by a plebiscite organized by their\r\n    representatives in a Constituent Assembly, shall establish a form\r\n    of government and new fundamental laws for the Russian state.\r\n\r\n    Consequently, invoking the benediction of our Lord, I urge all\r\n    citizens of Russia to submit to the Provisional Government,\r\n    established upon the initiative of the Duma and invested with full\r\n    plenary powers, until such time which will follow with as little\r\n    delay as possible, as the Constituent Assembly, on a basis of\r\n    universal, direct, equal, and secret suffrage, shall, by its\r\n    decision as to the new form of government, express the will of the\r\n    people.\r\n\r\nThe hated Romanov dynasty was ended at last. It is not likely that\r\nGrand-Duke Michael entertained the faintest hope that he would ever be\r\ncalled to the throne, either by a Constituent Assembly or by a popular\r\nreferendum. Not only was the Romanov dynasty ended, but equally so was\r\nmonarchical Absolutism itself. No other dynasty would replace that of the\r\nRomanovs. Russia had thrown off the yoke of autocracy. The Second\r\nRevolution was an accomplished fact; its first phase was complete.\r\nThoughtful men among the revolutionists recognized that the next phase\r\nwould be far more perilous and difficult. \"The bigger task is still before\r\nus,\" said Miliukov, in his address to the crowd that afternoon. A\r\nConstituent Assembly was to be held and that was bound to intensify the\r\ndifferences which had been temporarily composed during the struggle to\r\noverthrow the system of Absolutism. And the differences which existed\r\nbetween the capitalist class and the working class were not greater than\r\nthose which existed within the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nFROM BOURGEOISIE TO BOLSHEVIKI\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nIt required no great gift of prophecy to foretell the failure of the\r\nProvisional Government established by the revolutionary coalition headed by\r\nPrince Lvov. From the very first day it was evident that the Cabinet could\r\nnever satisfy the Russian people. It was an anomaly in that the Revolution\r\nhad been a popular revolution, while the Provisional Government was\r\noverwhelmingly representative of the landowners, manufacturers, bankers,\r\nand merchants--the despised and distrusted bourgeoisie. The very meager\r\nrepresentation given to the working class, through Kerensky, was, in the\r\ncircumstances, remarkable for its stupid effrontery and its disregard of\r\nthe most obvious realities. Much has been said and written of the\r\ndoctrinaire attitude which has characterized the Bolsheviki in the later\r\nphases of the struggle, but if by doctrinairism is meant subservience to\r\npreconceived theories and disregard of realities, it must be said that the\r\nstatesmen of the bourgeoisie were as completely its victims as the\r\nBolsheviki later proved to be. They were subservient to dogma and\r\nindifferent to fact.\r\n\r\nThe bourgeois leaders of Russia--and those Socialists who co-operated with\r\nthem--attempted to ignore the biggest and most vital fact in the whole\r\nsituation, namely, the fact that the Revolution was essentially a\r\nSocialist Revolution in the sense that the overwhelming mass of the people\r\nwere bent upon the realization of a very comprehensive, though somewhat\r\ncrudely conceived, program of socialization. It was not a mere political\r\nRevolution, and political changes which left the essential social structure\r\nunchanged, which did not tend to bring about equality of democratic\r\nopportunity, and which left the control of the nation in the hands of\r\nlandowners and capitalists, could never satisfy the masses nor fail to\r\ninvite their savage attack. Only the most hopeless and futile of\r\ndoctrinaires could have argued themselves into believing anything else. It\r\nwas quite idle to argue from the experience of other countries that Russia\r\nmust follow the universal rule and establish and maintain bourgeois rule\r\nfor a period more or less prolonged. True, that had been the experience of\r\nmost nations, but it was foolish in the extreme to suppose that it must be\r\nthe experience of Russia, whose conditions were so utterly unlike those\r\nwhich had obtained in any nation which had by revolution established\r\nconstitutional government upon a democratic basis.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, in every other country revolution by the bourgeoisie itself\r\nhad been the main factor in the overthrow of autocracy. Feudalism and\r\nmonarchical autocracy fell in western Europe before the might of a powerful\r\nrising class. That this class in every case drew to its side the masses and\r\nbenefited by their co-operation must not be allowed to obscure the fact\r\nthat in these other countries of all the classes in society the bourgeoisie\r\nwas the most powerful. It was that fact which established its right to rule\r\nin place of the deposed rulers. The Russian middle class, however, lacked\r\nthat historic right to rule. In consequence of the backwardness of the\r\nnation from the point of view of industrial development, the bourgeoisie\r\nwas correspondingly backward and weak. Never in any country had a class so\r\nweak and uninfluential essayed the rôle of the ruling class. To believe\r\nthat a class which at the most did not exceed six per cent. of the\r\npopulation could assert and maintain its rule over a nation of one hundred\r\nand eighty millions of people, when these had been stirred by years of\r\nrevolutionary agitation, was at once pedantic and absurd.\r\n\r\nThe industrial proletariat was as backward and as relatively weak as the\r\nbourgeoisie. Except by armed force and tyranny of the worst kind, this\r\nclass could not rule Russia. Its fitness and right to rule are not\r\nappreciably greater than the fitness and right of the bourgeoisie. It\r\ncannot even be said on its behalf that it had waged the revolutionary\r\nstruggle of the working class, for in truth its share in the Russian\r\nrevolutionary movement had been relatively small, far less than that of the\r\npeasant organizations. With more than one hundred and thirty-five millions\r\nof peasants, from whose discontent and struggle the revolutionary movement\r\nhad drawn its main strength, neither the bourgeoisie nor the\r\nclass-conscious section of the industrial proletariat could set up its rule\r\nwithout angry protest and attacks which, soon or late, must overturn it.\r\nEvery essential fact in the Russian situation, which was so unique, pointed\r\nto the need for a genuine and sincere co-operation by the intelligent\r\nleaders of all the opposition elements until stability was attained,\r\ntogether with freedom from the abnormal difficulties due to the war. In any\r\nevent, the domination of the Provisional Government by a class so weak and\r\nso narrow in its outlook and aims was a disaster. As soon as time for\r\nreflection had been afforded the masses discontent and distrust were\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nFrom the first days there were ominous murmurings. Yet it must be confessed\r\nthat the Provisional Government manifested much greater enlightenment than\r\nmight have been expected of it and hastened to enact a program--quite\r\nremarkable for its liberality and vision; a program which, had it come from\r\na government more truly representative in its personnel of revolutionary\r\nRussia, might, with one important addition, have served as the foundation\r\nof an enduring structure. On March 18th the Provisional Government issued a\r\nstatement of its program and an appeal to the citizens for support. This\r\ndocument, which is said to have been the joint work of P.I. Novgorodtzev,\r\nN.V. Nekrasov, and P.N. Miliukov, read as follows:\r\n\r\n    CITIZENS: The Executive Committee of the Duma, with the\r\n    aid and support of the garrison of the capital and its\r\n    inhabitants, has succeeded in triumphing over the obnoxious forces\r\n    of the old régime so that we can proceed to a more stable\r\n    organization of the executive power, with men whose past political\r\n    activity assures them the country's confidence.\r\n\r\n    The new Cabinet will base its policy upon the following\r\n    principles: _First_.--An immediate and general amnesty for all\r\n    political and religious offenses, including terrorist acts and\r\n    military and agrarian offenses.\r\n\r\n    _Second_.--Liberty of speech and of the press; freedom for\r\n    alliances, unions, and strikes, with the extension of these\r\n    liberties to military officials, within the limits admitted by\r\n    military requirements.\r\n\r\n    _Third_.--Abolition of all social, religious, and national\r\n    restrictions.\r\n\r\n    _Fourth_.--To proceed forthwith to the preparation and convocation\r\n    of a Constituent Assembly, based on universal suffrage. This\r\n    Assembly will establish a stable universal régime.\r\n\r\n    _Fifth_.--The substitution of the police by a national militia,\r\n    with chiefs to be elected and responsible to the municipalities.\r\n\r\n    _Sixth_.--Communal elections to be based on universal, direct,\r\n    equal, and secret suffrage.\r\n\r\n    _Seventh_.--The troops which participated in the revolutionary\r\n    movement will not be disarmed, but will remain in Petrograd.\r\n\r\n    _Eighth_.--While maintaining strict military discipline for troops\r\n    in active service, it is desirable to abrogate for soldiers all\r\n    restrictions in the enjoyment of civil rights accorded other\r\n    citizens.\r\n\r\n    The Provisional Government desires to add that it has no intention\r\n    of taking advantage of war conditions to delay the realization of\r\n    the measures of reform above mentioned.\r\n\r\nThis address is worthy of especial attention. The generous liberalism of\r\nthe program it outlines cannot be denied, but it is political liberalism\r\nonly. It is not directly and definitely concerned with the great\r\nfundamental economic issues which so profoundly affect the life and\r\nwell-being of the working class, peasants, and factory-workers alike. It is\r\nthe program of men who saw in the Revolution only a great epochal political\r\nadvance. In this it reflects its bourgeois origin. With the exception of\r\nthe right to organize unions and strikes--which is a political measure--not\r\none of the important economic demands peculiar to the working class is met\r\nin the program. The land question, which was the economic basis of the\r\nRevolution, and without which there could have been no Revolution, was not\r\neven mentioned. And the Manifesto which the Provisional Government\r\naddressed to the nation on March 20th was equally silent with regard to the\r\nland question and the socialization of industry.\r\n\r\nEvidently the Provisional Government desired to confine itself as closely\r\nas possible to political democracy, and to leave fundamental economic\r\nreform to be attended to by the Constituent Assembly. If that were its\r\npurpose, it would have helped matters to have had the purpose clearly\r\nstated and not merely left to inference. But whatever the shortcomings of\r\nits first official statements, the actual program of the Provisional\r\nGovernment during the first weeks was far more satisfactory and afforded\r\nroom for great hope. On March 21st the constitution of Finland was\r\nrestored. On the following day amnesty was granted to all political and\r\nreligious offenders. Within a few days freedom and self-government were\r\ngranted to Poland, subject to the ratification of the Constituent Assembly.\r\nAt the same time all laws discriminating against the Jews were repealed by\r\nthe following decree:\r\n\r\nAll existing legal restrictions upon the rights of Russian citizens, based\r\nupon faith, religious teaching, or nationality, are revoked. In accordance\r\nwith this, we hereby repeal all laws existing in Russia as a whole, as well\r\nas for separate localities, concerning:\r\n\r\n    1. Selection of place of residence and change of residence.\r\n\r\n    2. Acquiring rights of ownership and other material rights in all\r\n    kinds of movable property and real estate, and likewise in the\r\n    possession of, the use and managing of all property, or receiving\r\n    such for security.\r\n\r\n    3. Engaging in all kinds of trades, commerce, and industry, not\r\n    excepting mining; also equal participation in the bidding for\r\n    government contracts, deliveries, and in public auctions.\r\n\r\n    4. Participation in joint-stock and other commercial or industrial\r\n    companies and partnerships, and also employment in these companies\r\n    and partnerships in all kinds of positions, either by elections or\r\n    by employment.\r\n\r\n    5. Employment of servants, salesmen, foremen, laborers, and trade\r\n    apprentices.\r\n\r\n    6. Entering the government service, civil as well as military, and\r\n    the grade or condition of such service; participation in the\r\n    elections for the institutions for local self-government, and all\r\n    kinds of public institutions; serving in all kinds of positions of\r\n    government and public establishments, as well as the prosecution\r\n    of the duties connected with such positions.\r\n\r\n    7. Admission to all kinds of educational institutions, whether\r\n    private, government, or public, and the pursuing of the courses of\r\n    instruction of these institutions, and receiving scholarships.\r\n    Also the pursuance of teaching and other educational professions.\r\n\r\n    8. Performing the duties of guardians, trustees, or jurors.\r\n\r\n    9. The use of language and dialects, other than Russian, in the\r\n    proceedings of private societies, or in teaching in all kinds of\r\n    private educational institutions, and in commercial bookkeeping.\r\n\r\nThus all the humiliating restrictions which had been imposed upon the\r\nJewish people were swept away. Had the Provisional Government done nothing\r\nelse than this, it would have justified itself at the bar of history. But\r\nit accomplished much more than this: before it had been in office a month,\r\nin addition to its liberation of Finns, Poles, and Jews, the Provisional\r\nGovernment abolished the death penalty; removed all the provincial\r\ngovernors and substituted for them the elected heads of the provincial\r\ncounty councils; _confiscated the large land holdings of the Imperial\r\nfamily and of the monasteries_; levied an excess war-profits tax on all war\r\nindustries; and fixed the price of food at rates greatly lower than had\r\nprevailed before. The Provisional Government had gone farther, and, while\r\ndeclaring that these matters must be left to the Constituent Assembly for\r\nsettlement, had declared itself in favor of woman suffrage and of _the\r\ndistribution of all land among the peasants, the terms and conditions of\r\nexpropriation and distribution to be determined by the Constituent\r\nAssembly_.\r\n\r\nThe Provisional Government also established a War Cabinet which introduced\r\nvarious reforms into the army. All the old oppressive regulations were\r\nrepealed and an attempt made to democratize the military system. Some of\r\nthese reforms were of the utmost value; others were rather dangerous\r\nexperiments. Much criticism has been leveled against the rules providing\r\nfor the election of officers by the men in the ranks, for a conciliation\r\nboard to act in disputes between men and officers over questions of\r\ndiscipline, and the abolition of the regulations requiring private soldiers\r\nto address officers by the title \"Sir.\" It must be borne in mind, however,\r\nin discussing these things, that these rules represented a great, honest\r\neffort to restore the morale of an army that had been demoralized, and to\r\ninfuse it with democratic faith and zeal in order that it might \"carry on.\"\r\nIt is not just to judge the rules without considering the conditions which\r\ncalled them forth.\r\n\r\nCertainly the Provisional Government--which the government of the United\r\nStates formally recognized on March 22d, being followed in this by the\r\nother Allied governments next day--could not be accused fairly of being\r\neither slothful or unfaithful. Its accomplishments during those first weeks\r\nwere most remarkable. Nevertheless, as the days went by it became evident\r\nthat it could not hope to satisfy the masses and that, therefore, it could\r\nnot last very long.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe Council of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates was pursuing its\r\nindependent existence, under the leadership of Tchcheidze, Skobelev,\r\nTseretelli, and other moderate Social Democrats. As yet the Bolsheviki were\r\na very small and uninfluential faction, lacking capable leadership. There\r\ncan be very little doubt that the Council represented the feelings of the\r\ngreat mass of the organized wage-earners far more satisfactorily than the\r\nProvisional Government did, or that it was trusted to a far greater degree,\r\nalike by the wage-earners of the cities and the peasants. A great\r\npsychological fact existed, a fact which the Provisional Government and the\r\ngovernments of the Allied nations might well have reckoned with: the\r\nRussian working-people, artisans and peasants alike, were aggressively\r\nclass conscious and could trust fully only the leaders of their own class.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the Social Democratic party was, at the beginning, so far\r\nfrom anything like Bolshevism, so thoroughly constructive and opportunistic\r\nin its policies, that its official organ, _Pravda_--not yet captured by the\r\nBolsheviki--put forward a program which might easily have been made the\r\nbasis for an effective coalition. It was in some respects disappointingly\r\nmoderate: like the program of the Provisional Government, it left the land\r\nquestion untouched, except in so far as the clause demanding the\r\nconfiscation of the property of the royal family and the Church bore upon\r\nit. The Social Democratic party, reflecting the interests of the city\r\nproletariat, had never been enthusiastic about the peasants' claim for\r\ndistribution of the land, and there had been much controversy between its\r\nleaders and the leaders of the Socialist-Revolutionary party, the party of\r\nthe peasants. The program as printed in Pravda read:\r\n\r\n    1. A biennial one-house parliament.\r\n\r\n    2. Wide extension of the principle of self-government.\r\n\r\n    3. Inviolability of person and dwelling.\r\n\r\n    4. Unlimited freedom of the press, of speech, and of assembly.\r\n\r\n    5. Freedom of movement in business.\r\n\r\n    6. Equal rights for all irrespective of sex, religion, and\r\n    nationality.\r\n\r\n    7. Abolition of class distinction.\r\n\r\n    8. Education in native language; native languages everywhere to\r\n    have equal rights with official language.\r\n\r\n    9. Every nationality in the state to have the right of\r\n    self-definition.\r\n\r\n    10. The right of all persons to prosecute officials before a jury.\r\n\r\n    11. Election of magistrates.\r\n\r\n    12. A citizen army instead of ordinary troops.\r\n\r\n    13. Separation of Church from state and school from Church.\r\n\r\n    14. Free compulsory education for both sexes to the age of\r\n    sixteen.\r\n\r\n    15. State feeding of poor children.\r\n\r\n    16. Confiscation of Church property, also that of the royal\r\n    family.\r\n\r\n    17. Progressive income tax.\r\n\r\n    18. An eight-hour day, with six hours for all under eighteen.\r\n\r\n    19. Prohibition of female labor where such is harmful to women.\r\n\r\n    20. A clear holiday once a week to consist of forty-two hours on\r\n    end.\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake to suppose that this very moderate program embraced\r\nall that the majority of the Social Democratic party aimed at. It was not\r\nintended to be more than an ameliorative program for immediate adoption by\r\nthe Constituent Assembly, for the convocation of which the Social Democrats\r\nwere most eager, and which they confidently believed would have a majority\r\nof Socialists of different factions.\r\n\r\nIn a brilliant and caustic criticism of conditions as they existed in the\r\npre-Bolshevist period, Trotzky denounced what he called \"the farce of dual\r\nauthority.\" In a characteristically clever and biting phrase, he described\r\nit as \"The epoch of Dual Impotence, the government not able, and the Soviet\r\nnot daring,\" and predicted its culmination in a \"crisis of unheard-of\r\nseverity.\"[5] There was more than a little truth in the scornful phrase. On\r\nthe one hand, there was the Provisional Government, to which the Soviet had\r\ngiven its consent and its allegiance, trying to discharge the functions of\r\ngovernment. On the other hand, there was the Soviet itself, claiming the\r\nright to control the course of the Provisional Government and indulging in\r\nsystematic criticism of the latter's actions. It was inevitable that the\r\nSoviet should have been driven irresistibly to the point where it must\r\neither renounce its own existence or oppose the Provisional Government.\r\n\r\nThe dominating spirit and thought of the Soviet was that of international\r\nsocial democracy. While most of the delegates believed that it was\r\nnecessary to prosecute the war and to defeat the aggressions of the Central\r\nEmpires, they were still Socialists, internationalists, fundamental\r\ndemocrats, and anti-imperialists. Not without good and sufficient reason,\r\nthey mistrusted the bourgeois statesmen and believed that some of the most\r\ninfluential among them were imperialists, actuated by a desire for\r\nterritorial expansion, especially the annexation of Constantinople, and\r\nthat they were committed to various secret treaties entered into by the old\r\nrégime with England, France, and Italy. In the meetings of the Soviet, and\r\nin other assemblages of workers, the ugly suspicion grew that the war was\r\nnot simply a war for national defense, for which there was democratic\r\nsanction and justification, but a war of imperialism, and that the\r\nProvisional Government was pursuing the old ways of secret diplomacy.\r\n\r\nStrength was given to this feeling when Miliukov, the Foreign Minister, in\r\nan interview championed the annexation of Constantinople as a necessary\r\nsafeguard for the outlet to the Mediterranean which Russian economic\r\ndevelopment needed. Immediately there was an outcry of protest from the\r\nSoviet, in which, it should be observed, the Bolsheviki were already\r\ngaining strength and confidence, thanks to the leadership of Kamenev,\r\nLenine's colleague, who had returned from Siberian exile. It was not only\r\nthe Bolsheviki, however, who protested against imperialistic tendencies.\r\nPractically the whole body of Socialists, Mensheviki and Bolsheviki alike,\r\nagreed in opposing imperialism and secret diplomacy. Socialists loyal to\r\nthe national defense and Socialists who repudiated that policy and deemed\r\nit treason to the cause of Socialism were united in this one thing.\r\n\r\nThe storm of protest which Miliukov's interview provoked was stilled\r\ntemporarily when the Premier, Lvov, announced that the Foreign Minister's\r\nviews concerning the annexation of Constantinople were purely personal and\r\ndid not represent the policy of the Provisional Government. Assurances were\r\ngiven that the Provisional Government was in accord with the policy of the\r\nSoviet. On April 16th a national congress of the Councils of Workmen's and\r\nSoldiers' Delegates adopted a series of resolutions in which there was a\r\ndistinct menace to the Provisional Government. An earlier proclamation by\r\nthe Petrograd Soviet had taken the form of a letter addressed to\r\n\"Proletarians and Working-people of all Countries,\" but being in fact an\r\nappeal to the German working class to rise and refuse to fight against\r\ndemocratic and free Russia.[6] It declared that the peoples must take the\r\nmatter of deciding questions of war and peace into their own hands. The new\r\ndeclaration was addressed to the Russian people:\r\n\r\n    _First_.--The Provisional Government, which constituted itself\r\n    during the Revolution, in agreement with the Council of Workmen's\r\n    and Soldiers' Delegates of Petrograd, published a proclamation\r\n    announcing its program. This Congress records that this program\r\n    contains in principle political demands for Russian democracy, and\r\n    _recognizes that so far the Provisional Government has faithfully\r\n    carried out its promises_.\r\n\r\n    _Second_.--This Congress appeals to the whole revolutionary\r\n    democracy of Russia to rally to the support of the Council of\r\n    Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates, which is the center of the\r\n    organized democratic forces that are capable, in unison with\r\n    other progressive forces, of counteracting any counter\r\n    revolutionary attempt and of consolidating the conquests of the\r\n    revolution.\r\n\r\n    _Third_.--The Congress recognizes the necessity of permanent\r\n    political control, the necessity of exercising an influence over\r\n    the Provisional Government which will keep it up to a more\r\n    energetic struggle against anti-revolutionary forces, and the\r\n    necessity of exercising an influence which will insure its\r\n    democratizing the whole Russian life and paving the way for a\r\n    common _peace without annexations or contributions_, but on a\r\n    basis of free national development of all peoples.\r\n\r\n    _Fourth_.--The Congress appeals to the democracy, while declining\r\n    responsibility for any of its acts, to support the Provisional\r\n    Government as long as it continues to consolidate and develop the\r\n    conquest of the Revolution, _and as long as the basis of its\r\n    foreign policy does not rest upon aspirations for territorial\r\n    expansion_.\r\n\r\n    _Fifth_.--The Congress calls upon the revolutionary democracy of\r\n    Russia, rallying around the Council of Workmen's and Soldiers'\r\n    Delegates, to be ready to _vigorously suppress any attempt by the\r\n    government to elude the control of democracy or to renounce the\r\n    carrying out of its pledges_.[7]\r\n\r\nOn April 27th, acting under pressure from the Soviet, the Provisional\r\nGovernment published a Manifesto to the Russian people in which it\r\nannounced a foreign policy which conformed to that which the Congress of\r\nCouncils of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates had adopted. On May 1st\r\nMiliukov, the Foreign Minister, transmitted this Manifesto to the Allied\r\ngovernments as a preliminary to an invitation to those governments to\r\nrestate their war aims. Accompanying the Manifesto was a Note of\r\nexplanation, which was interpreted by a great many of the Socialists as an\r\nintimation to the Allies that the Manifesto was intended merely for home\r\nconsumption, and that the Provisional Government would be glad to have the\r\nAllies disregard it. It is difficult for any one outside of Russia, whose\r\nsympathies were with the Entente Allies, to gather such an impression from\r\nthe text of the Note, which simply set forth that enemy attempts to spread\r\nthe belief that Russia was about to make a separate peace with Germany made\r\nit necessary for the Provisional Government to state its \"entire agreement\"\r\nwith the aims of the Allies as set forth by their statesmen, including\r\nPresident Wilson, and to affirm that \"the Provisional Government, in\r\nsafeguarding the right acquired for our country, will maintain a strict\r\nregard for its agreement with the allies of Russia.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough it was explained that the Note had been sent with the knowledge\r\nand approval of the Provisional Government, the storm of fury it produced\r\nwas directed against Miliukov and, in less degree, Guchkov. Tremendous\r\ndemonstrations of protest against \"imperialism\" were held. In the Soviet a\r\nvigorous demand for the overthrow of the Provisional Government was made by\r\nthe steadily growing Bolshevik faction and by many anti-Bolsheviki\r\nSocialists. To avert the disaster of a vote of the Soviet against it, the\r\nProvisional Government made the following explanation of the so-called\r\nMiliukov Note:\r\n\r\n    The Note was subjected to long and detailed examination by the\r\n    Provisional Government, and was unanimously approved. This Note,\r\n    in speaking of a \"decisive victory,\" had in view a solution of the\r\n    problems mentioned in the communication of April 9th, and which\r\n    was thus specified:\r\n\r\n    \"The government deems it to be its right and duty to declare now\r\n    that free Russia does not aim at the domination of other nations,\r\n    or at depriving them of their national patrimony, or at occupying\r\n    by force foreign territories, but that its object is to establish\r\n    a durable peace on the basis of the rights of nations to decide\r\n    their own destiny.\r\n\r\n    \"The Russian nation does not lust after the strengthening of its\r\n    power abroad at the expense of other nations. Its aim is not to\r\n    subjugate or humiliate any one. In the name of the higher\r\n    principles of equity, the Russian people have broken the chains\r\n    which fettered the Polish nation, but it will not suffer that its\r\n    own country shall emerge from the great struggle humiliated or\r\n    weakened in its vital forces.\r\n\r\n    \"In referring to the 'penalties and guarantees' essential to a\r\n    durable peace, the Provisional Government had in view the\r\n    reduction of armaments, the establishment of international\r\n    tribunals, etc.\r\n\r\n    \"This explanation will be communicated by the Minister of Foreign\r\n    Affairs to the Ambassadors of the Allied Powers.\"\r\n\r\nThis assurance satisfied a majority of the delegates to the Soviet meeting\r\nheld on the evening of May 4th, and a resolution of confidence in the\r\nProvisional Government was carried, after a very stormy debate. The\r\nmajority, however, was a very small one, thirty-five in a total vote of\r\nabout twenty-five hundred. It was clearly evident that the political\r\ngovernment and the Soviet, which was increasingly inclined to assume the\r\nfunctions of government, were nearing a serious breach. With each day the\r\nCouncil of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates, as the organized expression\r\nof the great mass of wage-workers in Petrograd, grew in power over the\r\nProvisional Government and its influence throughout the whole of Russia. On\r\nMay 13th Guchkov resigned, and three days later Miliukov followed his\r\nexample. The party of the Constitutional Democrats had come to be\r\nidentified in the minds of the revolutionary proletariat with imperialism\r\nand secret diplomacy, and was utterly discredited. The crisis developed an\r\nintensification of the distrust of the bourgeoisie by the proletariat.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe crisis was not due solely to the diplomacy of the Provisional\r\nGovernment. Indeed, that was a minor cause. Behind all the discussions and\r\ndisputes over Miliukov's conduct of the affairs of the Foreign Office there\r\nwas the far more serious issue created by the agitation of the Bolsheviki.\r\nUnder the leadership of Kamenev, Lenine, and others less well known, who\r\nskillfully exploited the friction with the Provisional Government, the idea\r\nof overthrowing that bourgeois body and of asserting that the Councils of\r\nWorkmen's and Soldiers' Delegates would rule Russia in the interests of the\r\nworking class made steady if not rapid progress.\r\n\r\nLate in April Lenine and several other active Bolshevik leaders returned to\r\nPetrograd from Switzerland, together with Martov and other Menshevik\r\nleaders, who, while differing from the Bolsheviki upon practically all\r\nother matters, agreed with them in their bitter and uncompromising\r\nopposition to the war and in demanding an immediate peace.[8] As is well\r\nknown, they were granted special facilities by the German Government in\r\norder that they might reach Russia safely. Certain Swiss Socialist leaders,\r\nregarded as strongly pro-German, arranged with the German Government that\r\nthe Russian revolutionists should be permitted to travel across Germany by\r\nrail, in closed carriages. Unusual courtesies were extended to the\r\ntravelers by the German authorities, and it was quite natural that Lenine\r\nand his associates should have been suspected of being sympathizers with,\r\nif not the paid agents and tools of, the German Government. The manner in\r\nwhich their actions, when they arrived in Russia, served the ends sought\r\nby the German military authorities naturally strengthened the suspicion so\r\nthat it became a strong conviction.\r\n\r\nSuspicious as the circumstances undoubtedly were, there is a very simple\r\nexplanation of the conduct of Lenine and his companions. It is not at all\r\nnecessary to conclude that they were German agents. Let us look at the\r\nfacts with full candor: Lenine had long openly advocated the view that the\r\ndefeat of Russia, even by Germany, would be good for the Russian\r\nrevolutionary movement. But that was in the days before the overthrow of\r\nthe Czar. Since that time his position had naturally shifted somewhat; he\r\nhad opposed the continuation of the war and urged the Russian workers to\r\nwithhold support from it. He had influenced the Soviets to demand a\r\nrestatement of war aims by the Allies, and to incessantly agitate for\r\nimmediate negotiations looking toward a general and democratic peace. Of\r\ncourse, the preaching of such a policy in Russia at that time by a leader\r\nso powerful and influential as Lenine, bound as it was to divide Russia and\r\nsow dissension among the Allies, fitted admirably into the German plans.\r\nThat Germany would have been glad to pay for the performance of service so\r\nvaluable can hardly be doubted.\r\n\r\nOn his side, Lenine is far too astute a thinker to have failed to\r\nunderstand that the German Government had its own selfish interests in view\r\nwhen it arranged for his passage across Germany. But the fact that the\r\nAllies would suffer, and that the Central Empires would gain some\r\nadvantage, was of no consequence to him. That was an unavoidable accident\r\nand was purely incidental. His own purpose, to lead the revolutionary\r\nmovement into a new phase, in which he believed with fanatical\r\nthoroughness, was the only thing that mattered in the least. If the\r\nconditions had been reversed, and he could only have reached Russia by the\r\nco-operation of the Allies, whose cause would be served, however\r\nunintentionally, by his work, he would have felt exactly the same. On the\r\nother hand, it was of the essence of his faith that his policy would lead\r\nto the overthrow of all capitalist-imperialist governments, those of\r\nGermany and her allies no less than those ranged on the other side. Germany\r\nmight reason that a revolutionary uprising led by Lenine would rid her of\r\none of her enemies and enable her to hurl larger forces against the foe on\r\nthe western front. At that reasoning Lenine would smile in derision,\r\nthoroughly believing that any uprising he might bring about in Russia would\r\nsweep westward and destroy the whole fabric of Austro-German\r\ncapitalist-imperialism. Lenine knew that he was being used by Germany, but\r\nhe believed that he, in turn, was using Germany. He was supremely confident\r\nthat he could outplay the German statesmen and military leaders.\r\n\r\nIt was a dangerous game that Lenine was playing, and he knew it, but the\r\nstakes were high and worth the great risk involved. It was not necessary\r\nfor Germany to buy the service he could render to her; that service would\r\nbe an unavoidable accompaniment of his mission. He argued that his work\r\ncould, at the worst, give only temporary advantage to Germany. So far as\r\nthere is any evidence to show, Lenine has been personally incorruptible.\r\nHolding lightly what he scornfully derides as \"bourgeois morality,\" unmoral\r\nrather than immoral, willing to use any and all means to achieve ends which\r\nhe sincerely believes to be the very highest and noblest that ever inspired\r\nmankind, he would, doubtless, take German money if he saw that it would\r\nhelp him to achieve his purposes. He would do so, however, without any\r\nthought of self-aggrandizement. It is probably safe and just to believe\r\nthat if Lenine ever took money from the Germans, either at that time or\r\nsubsequently, he did so in this spirit, believing that the net result of\r\nhis efforts would be equally disastrous to all the capitalist governments\r\nconcerned in the war. It must be remembered, moreover, that the\r\ndistinctions drawn by most thoughtful men between autocratic governments\r\nlike those which ruled Germany and Austria and the more democratic\r\ngovernments of France, England, and America, have very little meaning or\r\nvalue to men like Lenine. They regard the political form as relatively\r\nunimportant; what matters is the fundamental economic class interest\r\nrepresented by the governments. Capitalist governments are all equally\r\nundesirable.\r\n\r\nWhat Lenine's program was when he left Switzerland is easily learned. A few\r\ndays before he left Switzerland he delivered a lecture on \"The Russian\r\nRevolution,\" in which he made a careful statement of his position. It gives\r\na very good idea of Lenine's mental processes. It shows him as a Marxist of\r\nthe most dogmatic type--the type which caused Marx himself to rejoice that\r\nhe was not a \"Marxist\":\r\n\r\n    As to the revolutionary organization and its task, the conquest of\r\n    the power of the state and militarism: From the praxis of the\r\n    French Commune of 1871, Marx shows that \"the working class cannot\r\n    simply take over the governmental machinery as built by the\r\n    bourgeoisie, and use this machinery for its own purposes.\" The\r\n    proletariat must break down this machinery. And this has been\r\n    either concealed or denied by the opportunists.[9] But it is the\r\n    most valuable lesson of the Paris Commune of 1871 and the\r\n    Revolution in Russia in 1905. The difference between us and the\r\n    Anarchists is, that we admit the state is a necessity in the\r\n    development of our Revolution. The difference with the\r\n    opportunists and the Kautsky[10] disciples is that we claim that\r\n    we do not need the bourgeois state machinery as completed in the\r\n    \"democratic\" bourgeois republics, but _the direct power of armed\r\n    and organized workers_. Such was the character of the Commune of\r\n    1871 and of the Council of Workmen and Soldiers of 1905 and 1917.\r\n    On this basis we build.[11]\r\n\r\nLenine went on to outline his program of action, which was to begin a new\r\nphase of the Revolution; to carry the revolt against Czarism onward against\r\nthe bourgeoisie. Notwithstanding his scorn for democracy, he declared at\r\nthat time that his policy included the establishment of a \"democratic\r\nrepublic,\" confiscation of the landed estates of the nobility in favor of\r\nthe peasants, and the opening up of immediate peace negotiations. But the\r\nlatter he would take out of the hands of the government entirely. \"Peace\r\nnegotiations should not be carried on by and with bourgeois governments,\r\nbut with the proletariat in each of the warring countries.\" In his\r\ncriticism of Kerensky and Tchcheidze the Bolshevik leader was especially\r\nscornful and bitter.\r\n\r\nIn a letter which he addressed to the Socialists of Switzerland immediately\r\nafter his departure for Russia, Lenine gave a careful statement of his own\r\nposition and that of his friends. It shows an opportunistic attitude of\r\nmind which differs from the opportunistic attitude of the moderate\r\nSocialists _in direction only_, not in the _quality of being\r\nopportunistic_:\r\n\r\n    Historic conditions have made the Russians, _perhaps for a short\r\n    period_, the leaders of the revolutionary world proletariat, _but\r\n    Socialism cannot now prevail in Russia_. We can expect only an\r\n    agrarian revolution, which will help to create more favorable\r\n    conditions for further development of the proletarian forces and\r\n    _may result in measures for the control of production and\r\n    distribution_.\r\n\r\n    The main results of the present Revolution will have to be _the\r\n    creation of more favorable conditions for further revolutionary\r\n    development_, and to influence the more highly developed European\r\n    countries into action.[12]\r\n\r\nThe Bolsheviki at this period had as their program the following:\r\n\r\n(1) The Soviets of Workers, Soldiers, and Peasants to constitute themselves\r\ninto the actual revolutionary government and establish the dictatorship of\r\nthe proletariat; (2) immediate confiscation of landed estates without\r\ncompensation, the seizure to be done by the peasants themselves, without\r\nwaiting for legal forms or processes, the peasants to organize into\r\nSoviets; (3) measures for the control of production and distribution by the\r\nrevolutionary government, nationalization of monopolies, repudiation of the\r\nnational debt; (4) the workers to take possession of factories and operate\r\nthem in co-operation with the technical staffs; (5) refusal by the Soviets\r\nto recognize any treaties made by the governments either of the Czar or the\r\nbourgeoisie, and the immediate publication of all such treaties; (6) the\r\nworkers to propose at once and publicly an immediate truce and negotiations\r\nof peace, these to be carried on by the proletariat and not by and with the\r\nbourgeoisie; (7) bourgeois war debts to be paid exclusively by the\r\ncapitalists.\r\n\r\nAccording to Litvinov, who is certainly not an unfriendly authority, as\r\nsoon as Lenine arrived in Russia he submitted a new program to his party\r\nwhich was so novel, and so far a departure from accepted Socialist\r\nprinciples, that \"Lenine's own closest friends shrank from it and refused\r\nto accept it.\"[13]\r\n\r\nThis program involved the abandonment of the plans made for holding the\r\nConstituent Assembly, or, at any rate, such a radical change as to amount\r\nto the abandonment of the accepted plans. _He proposed that universal,\r\nequal, direct, and secret suffrage be frankly abandoned, and that only the\r\nindustrial proletariat and the poorest section of the peasantry be\r\npermitted to vote at all!_ Against the traditional Socialist view that\r\nclass distinctions must be wiped out and the class war ended by the\r\nvictorious proletariat, Lenine proposed to make the class division more\r\nrigid and enduring. He proposed to give the sole control of Russia into the\r\nhands of not more than two hundred thousand workers in a land of one\r\nhundred and eighty millions of people, more than one hundred and\r\nthirty-five millions of whom were peasants!\r\n\r\nOf course, there could be no reconciliation between such views as these and\r\nthe universally accepted Socialist principle of democratic government.\r\nLenine did not hesitate to declare that democracy itself was a \"bourgeois\r\nconception\" which the revolutionary proletariat must overthrow, a\r\ndeclaration hard to reconcile with his demand for a \"democratic republic.\"\r\nRussia must not become a democratic republic, he argued, for a democratic\r\nrepublic is a bourgeois republic. Again and again, during the time we are\r\ndiscussing and later, Lenine assailed the principle of democratic\r\ngovernment. \"Since March, 1917, the word 'democracy' is simply a shackle\r\nfastened upon the revolutionary nation,\" he declared in an article written\r\nafter the Bolsheviki had overthrown Kerensky.[14]\r\n\r\nWhen democracy is abolished, parliamentary government goes with it. From\r\nthe first days after his return to Russia Lenine advocated, instead of a\r\nparliamentary republic similar to that of France or the United States, what\r\nhe called a Soviet republic, which would be formed upon these lines: local\r\ngovernment would be carried on by local Soviets composed of delegates\r\nelected by \"the working class and the poorest peasantry,\" to use a common\r\nBolshevik phrase which bothers a great many people whose minds insist upon\r\nclassifying peasants as \"working-people\" and part of the working class.\r\nWhat Lenine means when he uses the phrase, and what Litvinov means[15] is\r\nthat the industrial wage-workers--to whom is applied the term \"working\r\nclass\"--must be sharply distinguished from peasants and small farmers,\r\nthough the very poorest peasants, not being conservative, as more\r\nprosperous peasants are, can be united with the wage-workers.\r\n\r\nThese local Soviets functioning in local government would, in Lenine's\r\nSoviet republic, elect delegates to a central committee of all the Soviets\r\nin the country, and that central committee would be the state. Except in\r\ndetails of organization, this is not materially different from the\r\nfundamental idea of the I.W.W. with which we are familiar.[16] According to\r\nthe latter, the labor-unions, organized on industrial lines and federated\r\nthrough a central council, will take the place of parliamentary government\r\nelected on territorial lines. According to the Bolshevik plan, Soviets\r\nwould take the place held by the unions in the plan of the I.W.W. It is not\r\nto be wondered at that, in the words of Litvinov, Lenine's own closest\r\nfriends shrank from his scheme and Lenine \"was compelled to drop it for a\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nBolshevism was greatly strengthened in its leadership by the return of Leon\r\nTrotzky, who arrived in Petrograd on May 17th. Trotzky was born in Moscow\r\nabout forty-five years ago. Like Lenine, he is of bourgeois origin, his\r\nfather being a wealthy Moscow merchant. He is a Jew and his real name is\r\nBronstein. To live under an assumed name has always been a common practice\r\namong Russian revolutionists, for very good and cogent reasons. Certainly\r\nall who knew anything at all of the personnel of the Russian revolutionary\r\nmovement during the past twenty years knew that Trotzky was Bronstein, and\r\nthat he was a Jew. The idea, assiduously disseminated by a section of the\r\nAmerican press, that there must be something discreditable or mysterious\r\nconnected with his adoption of an alias is extremely absurd, and can only\r\nbe explained by monumental ignorance of Russian revolutionary history.\r\n\r\nTrotzky has been a fighter in the ranks of the revolutionary army of Russia\r\nfor twenty years. As early as 1900 his activities as a Socialist\r\npropagandist among students had landed him in prison in solitary\r\nconfinement. In 1902 he was exiled to eastern Siberia, whence he managed to\r\nescape. During the next three years he lived abroad, except for brief\r\nintervals spent in Russia, devoting himself to Socialist journalism. His\r\nfirst pamphlet, published in Geneva in 1903, was an attempt to reconcile\r\nthe two factions in the Social Democratic party, the Bolsheviki and the\r\nMensheviki. He was an orthodox Marxist of the most extreme doctrinaire\r\ntype, and naturally inclined to the Bolshevik view. Yet he never joined the\r\nBolsheviki, preferring to remain aloof from both factions and steadfastly\r\nand earnestly striving to unite them.\r\n\r\nWhen the Revolution of 1905 broke out Trotzky had already attained\r\nconsiderable influence among the Socialists. He was regarded as one of the\r\nablest of the younger Marxians, and men spoke of him as destined to occupy\r\nthe place of Plechanov. He became one of the most influential leaders of\r\nthe St. Petersburg Soviet, and was elected its president. In that capacity\r\nhe labored with titanic energy and manifested great versatility, as\r\norganizer, writer, speaker, and arbiter of disputes among warring\r\nindividuals and groups. When the end came he was arrested and thrown into\r\nprison, where he remained for twelve months. After that he was tried and\r\nsentenced to life-exile in northern Siberia. From this he managed to\r\nescape, however, and from 1907 until the outbreak of the war in 1914 he\r\nlived in Vienna.\r\n\r\nThe first two years of the war he lived in France, doing editorial work for\r\na radical Russian Socialist daily paper, the _Nashe Slovo_. His writing,\r\ntogether with his activity in the Zimmerwald movement of anti-war\r\nSocialists, caused his expulsion from France. The Swiss government having\r\nrefused to permit him to enter Switzerland, he sought refuge in Spain,\r\nwhere he was once more arrested and imprisoned for a short time. Released\r\nthrough the intervention of Spanish Socialists, he set sail with his family\r\nfor New York, where he arrived early in January, 1917. Soon after the news\r\nof the Russian Revolution thrilled the world Trotzky, like many other\r\nRussian exiles, made hasty preparations to return, sailing on March 27th\r\non a Norwegian steamer. At Halifax he and his family, together with a\r\nnumber of other Russian revolutionists, were taken from the ship and\r\ninterned in a camp for war prisoners, Trotzky resisting violently and\r\nhaving to be carried off the ship. The British authorities kept them\r\ninterned for a month, but finally released them at the urgent demand of the\r\nForeign Minister of the Russian Provisional Government, Miliukov.\r\n\r\nSuch, in brief outline, is the history of the man Trotzky. It is a typical\r\nRussian history: the story of a persistent, courageous, and exceedingly\r\nable fighter for an ideal believed in with fanatical devotion. Lenine, in\r\none of his many disputes with Trotzky, called him \"a man who blinds himself\r\nwith revolutionary phrases,\"[17] and the description is very apt. He\r\npossesses all the usual characteristics of the revolutionary Jewish\r\nSocialists of Russia. To a high-strung, passionate, nervous temperament and\r\nan exceedingly active imagination he unites a keen intellect which finds\r\nits highest satisfaction in theoretical abstractions and subtleties, and\r\nwhich accepts, phrases as though they were realities.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding of Trotzky's attitude during the recent revolutionary and\r\ncounter-revolutionary struggles is made easier by understanding the\r\ndevelopment of his thought in the First Revolution, 1905-06. He began as an\r\nextremely orthodox Marxist, and believed that any attempt to establish a\r\nSocialist order in Russia until a more or less protracted intensive\r\neconomic development, exhausting the possibilities of capitalism, made\r\nchange inevitable, must fail. He accepted the view that a powerful\r\ncapitalist class must be developed and perform its indispensable historical\r\nrôle, to be challenged and overthrown in its turn by the proletariat. That\r\nwas the essence of his pure and unadulterated faith. To it he clung with\r\nall the tenacity of his nature, deriding as \"Utopians\" and \"dreamers\" the\r\npeasant Socialists who refused to accept the Marxian theory of Socialism as\r\nthe product of historic necessity as applicable to Russia.\r\n\r\nThe great upheaval of 1905 changed his viewpoint. The manner in which\r\nrevolutionary ideas spread among the masses created in Trotzky, as in many\r\nothers, almost unbounded confidence and enthusiasm. In an essay written\r\nsoon after the outbreak of the Revolution he wrote: \"The Revolution has\r\ncome. _One move of hers has lifted the people over scores of steps, up\r\nwhich in times of peace we would have had to drag ourselves with hardships\r\nand fatigue_.\" The idea that the Revolution had \"lifted the people over\r\nscores of steps\" possessed him and changed his whole conception of the\r\nmanner in which Socialism was to come. Still calling himself a Marxist, and\r\nbelieving as strongly as ever in the fundamental Marxian doctrines, as he\r\nunderstood them, he naturally devoted his keen mind with its peculiar\r\naptitude for Talmudic hair-splitting to a new interpretation of Marxism. He\r\ndeclared his belief that in Russia it was possible to change from\r\nAbsolutism to Socialism immediately, without the necessity of a prolonged\r\nperiod of capitalist development. At the same time, he maintained a\r\nscornful attitude toward the \"Utopianism\" of the peasant Socialists, who\r\nhad always made the same contention, because he believed they based their\r\nhopes and their policy upon a wrong conception of Socialism. He had small\r\npatience for their agrarian Socialism with its economic basis in\r\npeasant-proprietorship and voluntary co-operation.\r\n\r\nHe argued that the Russian bourgeoisie was so thoroughly infected with the\r\nills of the bureaucratic system that it was itself decadent; not virile\r\nand progressive as a class aiming to possess the future must be. Since it\r\nwas thus corrupted and weakened, and therefore incapable of fulfilling any\r\nrevolutionary historical rôle, that became the _immediate_ task of the\r\nproletariat. Here was an example of the manner in which lifting over\r\nrevolutionary steps was accomplished. Of course, the peasantry was in a\r\nbackward and even primitive state which unfitted it for the proletarian\r\nrôle. Nevertheless, it had a class consciousness of its own, and an\r\nirresistible hunger for land. Without this class supporting it, or, at\r\nleast, acquiescing in its rule, the proletariat could never hope to seize\r\nand hold the power of government. It would be possible to solve the\r\ndifficulty here presented, Trotzky contended, if the enactment of the\r\npeasant program were permitted during the Revolution and accepted by the\r\nproletariat as a _fait accompli_. This would satisfy the peasants and make\r\nthem content to acquiesce in a proletarian dictatorship. Once firmly\r\nestablished in power, it would be possible for the proletariat to gradually\r\napply the true Socialist solution to the agrarian problem and to convert\r\nthe peasants. \"Once in power, the proletariat will appear before the\r\npeasantry as its liberator,\" he wrote.\r\n\r\nHis imagination fired by the manner in which the Soviet of which he was\r\npresident held the loyalty of the masses during the revolutionary uprising,\r\nand the representative character it developed, Trotzky conceived the idea\r\nthat it lent itself admirably to the scheme of proletarian dictatorship.\r\nParliamentary government cannot be used to impose and maintain a\r\ndictatorship, whether of autocracy or oligarchy, bourgeoisie or\r\nproletariat. In the Soviet, as a result of six weeks' experience in\r\nabnormal times, during which it was never for a moment subjected to the\r\ntest of maintaining the economic life of the nation, Trotzky saw the ideal\r\nproletarian government. He once described the Soviet as \"a true,\r\nunadulterated democracy,\" but, unless we are to dismiss the description as\r\nidle and vain rhetoric, we must assume that the word \"democracy\" was used\r\nin an entirely new sense, utterly incompatible with its etymological and\r\nhistorical meaning. Democracy has always meant absence of class rule;\r\nproletarian dictatorship is class rule.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing analysis of the theoretical and tactical views which\r\nTrotzky held during and immediately after the First Revolution, it is easy\r\nto see the genesis of the policies of the Bolshevik government which came\r\ntwelve years later. The intervening years served only to deepen his\r\nconvictions. At the center of all his thinking during that period was his\r\nbelief in the sufficiency of the Soviet, and in the need of proletarian\r\ndictatorship. Throwing aside the first cautious thought that these things\r\narose from the peculiar conditions existing in Russia as a result of her\r\nretarded economic development, he had come to regard them as applicable to\r\nall nations and to all peoples, except, perhaps, the peoples still living\r\nin barbarism or savagery.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nAfter the crisis which resulted in the resignation of Miliukov and Guchkov,\r\nit was evident that the Lvov government could not long endure. The\r\nsituation in the army, as well as in the country, was so bad that the\r\ncomplete reorganization of the Provisional Government, upon much more\r\nradical lines, was imperative. The question arose among the revolutionary\r\nworking-class organizations whether they should consent to co-operation\r\nwith the liberal bourgeoisie in a new coalition Cabinet or whether they\r\nshould refuse such co-operation and fight exclusively on class lines. This,\r\nof course, opened the entire controversy between Bolsheviki and Mensheviki.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the war-weary nation was clamoring for peace. The army was\r\ndemoralized and saturated with the defeatism preached by the Porazhentsi.\r\nTo deal with this grave situation two important conventions were arranged\r\nfor, as follows: the Convention of Soldiers' Delegates from the Front,\r\nwhich opened on May 10th and lasted for about a week, and the First\r\nAll-Russian Congress of Peasants' Delegates, which opened on May 17th and\r\nlasted for about twelve days. Between the two gatherings there was also an\r\nimportant meeting of the Petrograd Council of Workmen's and Soldiers'\r\nDeputies, which dealt with the same grave situation. The dates here are of\r\nthe greatest significance: the first convention was opened three days\r\nbefore Miliukov's resignation and was in session when that event occurred;\r\nthe second convention was opened four days after the resignation of\r\nMiliukov and one day after that of Guchkov. It was Guchkov's unique\r\nexperience to address the convention of Soldiers' Delegates from the Front\r\nas Minister of War and Marine, explaining and defending his policy with\r\ngreat ability, and then, some days later, to address the same assembly as a\r\nprivate citizen.\r\n\r\nGuchkov drew a terrible picture of the seriousness of the military\r\nsituation. With truly amazing candor he described conditions and explained\r\nhow they had been brought about. He begged the soldiers not to lay down\r\ntheir arms, but to fight with new courage. Kerensky followed with a long\r\nspeech, noble and full of pathos. In some respects, it was the most\r\npowerful of all the appeals it fell to his lot to make to his people, who\r\nwere staggering in the too strong sunlight of an unfamiliar freedom. He\r\ndid not lack courage to speak plainly: \"My heart and soul are uneasy. I am\r\ngreatly worried and I must say so openly, no matter what ... the\r\nconsequences will be. The process of resurrecting the country's creative\r\nforces for the purpose of establishing the new régime rests on the basis of\r\nliberty and personal responsibility.... A century of slavery has not only\r\ndemoralized the government and transformed the old officials into a band of\r\ntraitors, _but it has also destroyed in the people themselves the\r\nconsciousness of their responsibility for their fate, their country's\r\ndestiny_.\" It was in this address that he cried out in his anguish: \"I\r\nregret that I did not die two months ago. I would have died happy with the\r\ndream that the flame of a new life has been kindled in Russia, hopeful of a\r\ntime when we could respect one another's right without resorting to the\r\nknout.\"\r\n\r\nTo the soldiers Kerensky brought this challenge: \"You fired on the people\r\nwhen the government demanded. But now, when it comes to obeying your own\r\nrevolutionary government, you can no longer endure further sacrifice! Does\r\nthis mean that free Russia is a nation of rebellious slaves?\" He closed\r\nwith an eloquent peroration: \"I came here because I believe in my right to\r\ntell the truth as I understand it. People who even under the old régime\r\nwent about their work openly and without fear of death, those people, I\r\nsay, will not be terrorized. The fate of our country is in our hands and\r\nthe country is in great danger. We have sipped of the cup of liberty and we\r\nare somewhat intoxicated; we are in need of the greatest possible sobriety\r\nand discipline. We must go down in history meriting the epitaph on our\r\ntombstones, 'They died, but they were never slaves.'\"\r\n\r\nFrom the Petrograd Council of Workmen's and Soldiers' Deputies came I.G.\r\nTseretelli, who had just returned from ten years' Siberian exile. A native\r\nof Georgia, a prince, nearly half of his forty-two years had been spent\r\neither in Socialist service or in exile brought about by such service. A\r\nman of education, wise in leadership and a brilliant orator, his leadership\r\nof the Socialist Group in the Second Duma had marked him as one of the\r\ntruly great men of Russia. To the Convention of Soldiers' Delegates from\r\nthe Front Tseretelli brought the decisions of the Council of Workmen's and\r\nSoldiers' Deputies, in shaping which he had taken an important part with\r\nTchcheidze, Skobelev, and others. The Council had decided \"to send an\r\nappeal to the soldiers at the front, and to explain to them that _in order\r\nto bring about universal peace it is necessary to defend the Revolution and\r\nRussia by defending the front_.\" This action had been taken despite the\r\nopposition of the Bolsheviki, and showed that the moderate Socialists were\r\nstill in control of the Soviet. An Appeal to the Army, drawn up by\r\nTseretelli, was adopted by the vote of every member except the Bolsheviki,\r\nwho refrained from voting. This Appeal to the Army Tseretelli presented to\r\nthe Soldiers' Delegates from the Front:\r\n\r\n    Comrades, soldiers at the front, in the name of the Revolutionary\r\n    Democracy, we make a fervent appeal to you.\r\n\r\n    A hard task has fallen to your lot. You have paid a dear price,\r\n    you have paid with your blood, a dear price indeed, for the crimes\r\n    of the Czar who sent you to fight and left you without arms,\r\n    without ammunition, without bread!\r\n\r\n    Why, the privation you now suffer is the work of the Czar and his\r\n    coterie of self-seeking associates who brought the country to\r\n    ruin. And the Revolution will need the efforts of many to overcome\r\n    the disorganization left her as a heritage by these robbers and\r\n    executioners.\r\n\r\n    The working class did not need the war. The workers did not begin\r\n    it. It was started by the Czars and capitalists of all countries.\r\n    Each day of war is for the people only a day of unnecessary\r\n    suffering and misfortune. Having dethroned the Czar, the Russian\r\n    people have selected for their first problem the ending of the war\r\n    in the quickest possible manner.\r\n\r\n    The Council of Workmen's and Soldiers' Deputies has appealed to\r\n    all nations to end the butchery. We have appealed to the French\r\n    and the English, to the Germans and the Austrians.[18] Russia\r\n    wants an answer to this appeal. Remember, however, comrades and\r\n    soldiers, that our appeal will be of no value if the regiments of\r\n    Wilhelm overpower Revolutionary Russia before our brothers, the\r\n    workers and peasants of other countries, will be able to respond.\r\n    Our appeal will become \"a scrap of paper\" if the whole strength of\r\n    the revolutionary people does not stand behind it, if the triumph\r\n    of Wilhelm Hohenzollern will be established on the ruins of\r\n    Russian freedom. The ruin of free Russia will be a tremendous,\r\n    irreparable misfortune, not only for us, but for the toilers of\r\n    the whole world.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Comrades, soldiers, defend Revolutionary Russia with all your\r\n    might!\r\n\r\n    The workers and peasants of Russia desire peace with all their\r\n    soul. But this peace must be universal, a peace for all nations\r\n    based on the agreement of all.\r\n\r\n    What would happen if we should agree to a separate peace--a peace\r\n    for ourselves alone! What would happen if the Russian soldiers\r\n    were to stick their bayonets into the ground to-day and say that\r\n    they do not care to fight any longer, that it makes no difference\r\n    to them what happens to the whole world!\r\n\r\n    Here is what would happen. Having destroyed our allies in the\r\n    west, German Imperialism would rush in upon us with all the force\r\n    of its arms. Germany's imperialists, her landowners and\r\n    capitalists, would put an iron heel on our necks, would occupy our\r\n    cities, our villages, and our land, and would force us to pay\r\n    tribute to her. Was it to bow down at the feet of Wilhelm that we\r\n    overthrew Nicholas?\r\n\r\n    Comrades--soldiers! The Council of Workmen's and Soldiers'\r\n    Deputies leads you to peace by another route. We lead you to peace\r\n    by calling upon the workers and peasants of Serbia and Austria to\r\n    rise and revolt; we lead you to peace by calling an international\r\n    conference of Socialists for a universal and determined revolt\r\n    against war. There is a great necessity, comrades--soldiers, for\r\n    the peoples of the world to awaken. Time is needed in order that\r\n    they should rebel and with an iron hand force their Czars and\r\n    capitalists to peace. Time is needed so that the toilers of all\r\n    lands should join with us for a merciless war upon violators and\r\n    robbers.\r\n\r\n    _But remember, comrades--soldiers, this time will never come if\r\n    you do not stop the advance of the enemy at the front, if your\r\n    ranks are crushed and under the feet of Wilhelm falls the\r\n    breathless corpse of the Russian Revolution_.\r\n\r\n    Remember, comrades, that at the front, in the trenches, you are\r\n    now standing in defense of Russia's freedom. You defend the\r\n    Revolution, you defend your brothers, the workers and peasants.\r\n    Let this defense be worthy of the great cause and the great\r\n    sacrifices already made by you. _It is impossible to defend the\r\n    front if, as has been decided, the soldiers are not to leave the\r\n    trenches under any circumstances_.[19] At times only an attack can\r\n    repulse and prevent the advance of the enemy. At times awaiting an\r\n    attack means patiently waiting for death. Again, only the change\r\n    to an advance may save you or your brothers, on other sections of\r\n    the front, from destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Remember this, comrades--soldiers! Having sworn to defend Russian\r\n    freedom, do not refuse to start the offensive the military\r\n    situation may require. The freedom and happiness of Russia are in\r\n    your hands.\r\n\r\n    In defending this freedom be on the lookout for betrayal and\r\n    trickery. The fraternization which is developing on the front can\r\n    easily turn into such a trap.\r\n\r\n    Revolutionary armies may fraternize, but with whom? With an army\r\n    also revolutionary, which has decided to die for peace and\r\n    freedom. At present, however, not only in the German army, but\r\n    even in the Austro-Hungarian army, in spite of the number of\r\n    individuals politically conscious and honest, there is no\r\n    revolution. In those countries the armies are still blindly\r\n    following Wilhelm and Charles, the landowners and capitalists, and\r\n    agree to annexation of foreign soil, to robberies and violence.\r\n    There the General Staff will make use not only of your credulity,\r\n    but also of the blind obedience of their soldiers. You go out to\r\n    fraternize with open hearts. And to meet you an officer of the\r\n    General Staff leaves the enemies' trenches, disguised as a common\r\n    soldier. You speak with the enemy without any trickery. At that\r\n    very time he photographs the surrounding territory. You stop the\r\n    shooting to fraternize, but behind the enemies' trenches artillery\r\n    is being moved, new positions built and troops transferred.\r\n\r\n    Comrades--soldiers, not by fraternization will you get peace, not\r\n    by separate agreements made at the front by single companies,\r\n    battalions, or regiments. Not in separate peace or in a separate\r\n    truce lies the salvation of the Russian Revolution, the triumph of\r\n    peace for the whole world.\r\n\r\n    The people who assure you that fraternizing is the road to peace\r\n    lead you to destruction. Do not believe them. The road to peace is\r\n    a different one. It has been pointed out to you already by the\r\n    Council of Workmen's and Soldiers' Deputies: tread it. Sweep aside\r\n    everything that weakens your fighting power, that brings into the\r\n    army disorganization and loss of spirit.\r\n\r\n    Your fighting power serves the cause of peace. The Council of\r\n    Workmen's and Soldiers' Deputies is able to continue its\r\n    revolutionary work with all its might, to develop its struggle for\r\n    peace, only by depending on you, knowing that you will not allow\r\n    the military destruction of Russia.\r\n\r\n    Comrades--soldiers, the workers and peasants, not only of Russia,\r\n    but of the whole world, look to you with confidence and hope.\r\n\r\n    Soldiers of the Revolution, you will prove worthy of this faith,\r\n    for you know that your military tasks serve the cause of peace.\r\n\r\n    In the name of the happiness and freedom of Revolutionary Russia,\r\n    in the name of the coming brotherhood of nations, you will fulfil\r\n    your military duties with unconquerable strength.\r\n\r\nAgain and again Tseretelli was interrupted with cheers as he read this\r\nAppeal to the Army. He was cheered, too, when he explained that the Soviet\r\nhad decided to support the reconstructed Provisional Government and called\r\nupon the soldiers to do likewise. There was a storm of applause when he\r\nsaid: \"We well realize the necessity of having a strong power in Russia;\r\nhowever, the strength of this power must rely upon its progressive and\r\nrevolutionary policy. Our government must adopt the revolutionary slogans\r\nof democracy. It must grant the demands of the revolutionary people. It\r\nmust turn over all land to the laboring peasantry. It must safeguard the\r\ninterests of the working class, enacting improved social legislation for\r\nthe protection of labor. It must lead Russia to a speedy and lasting peace\r\nworthy of a great people.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Plechanov was introduced to the convention as \"the veteran of the\r\nRussian Revolution\" he received an ovation such as few men have ever been\r\naccorded. The great Socialist theorist plunged into a keen and forceful\r\nattack upon the theories of the Bolsheviki. He was frequently interrupted\r\nby angry cries and by impatient questionings, which he answered with\r\nrapier-like sentences. He was asked what a \"democratic\" government should\r\nbe, and replied:\r\n\r\n\"I am asked, 'What should a democratic government be? My answer is: It\r\nshould be a government enjoying the people's full confidence and\r\nsufficiently strong to prevent any possibility of anarchy. Under what\r\ncondition, then, can such a strong, democratic government be established?\r\nIn my opinion it is necessary, for this purpose, _that the government be\r\ncomposed of representatives of all those parts of the population that are\r\nnot interested in the restoration of the old order. What is called a\r\ncoalition Ministry is necessary_. Our comrades, the Socialists,\r\nacknowledging the necessity of entering the government, can and should set\r\nforth definite conditions, definite demands. _But there should be no\r\ndemands that would be unacceptable to the representatives of other classes,\r\nto the spokesmen of other parts of the population_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you have us Russian proletarians fight in this war for England's\r\ncolonial interests?\" was one of the questions hurled at Plechanov, and\r\ngreeted by the jubilant applause of the Bolsheviki. Plechanov replied with\r\ngreat spirit, his reply evoking a storm of cheers: \"The answer is clear to\r\nevery one who accepts the principle of self-determination of nations,\" he\r\nsaid. \"The colonies are not deserts, but populated localities, and their\r\npopulations should also be given the right to determine freely their own\r\ndestinies. It is clear that Russia cannot fight for the sake of any one's\r\npredatory aspirations. _But I am surprised that the question of annexations\r\nis raised in Russia, whose sixteen provinces are under the Prussian heel!_\r\nI do not understand this exclusive solicitude for Germany's interests.\"\r\n\r\nTo those who advocated fraternization, who were engaged in spreading the\r\nidea that the German working class would refuse to fight against the\r\nRussian revolutionists, the great Socialist teacher, possessing one of the\r\nripest minds in the whole international Socialist movement, and an intimate\r\nknowledge of the history of that movement, made vigorous reply and recited\r\na significant page of Socialist history:\r\n\r\n\"In the fall of 1906, when Wilhelm was planning to move his troops on the\r\nthen revolutionary Russia, I asked my comrades, the German Social\r\nDemocrats, 'What will you do in case Wilhelm declares war on Russia?' At\r\nthe party convention in Mannheim, Bebel gave me an answer to this question.\r\nBebel introduced a resolution in favor of the declaration of a general\r\nstrike in the event of war being declared on Russia. But this resolution\r\nwas not adopted; _members of the trade-unions voted against it_. This is a\r\nfact which you should not forget. Bebel had to beat a retreat and introduce\r\nanother resolution. Kautsky and Rosa Luxemburg were dissatisfied with\r\nBebel's conduct. I asked Kautsky whether there is a way to bring about a\r\ngeneral strike against the workers' will. As there is no such way, there\r\nwas nothing else that Bebel could do. _And if Wilhelm had sent his hordes\r\nto Russia in 1906, the German workers would not have done an earthly thing\r\nto prevent the butchery_. In September, 1914, the situation was still\r\nworse.\"\r\n\r\nThe opposition to Plechanov on the part of some of the delegates was an\r\nevidence of the extent to which disaffection, defeatism, and the readiness\r\nto make peace at any price almost--a general peace preferably, but, if not,\r\nthen a separate peace--had permeated even the most intelligent part of the\r\nRussian army. Bolshevism and its ally, defeatism, were far more influential\r\nin the ranks of the soldiers than in those of the workers in the factories.\r\nYet the majority was with Kerensky, Tseretelli, and Plechanov, as the\r\nfollowing resolutions adopted by the convention prove:\r\n\r\n    The first convention of the Delegates from the Front, having heard\r\n    reports on current problems from the representatives of the\r\n    Provisional Government, members of the Executive Committee of the\r\n    Council of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates, and from\r\n    representatives of the Socialist parties, and having considered\r\n    the situation, hereby resolves:\r\n\r\n    (1) That the disorganization of the food-supply system and the\r\n    weakening of the army's fighting capacity, due to a distrust of a\r\n    majority of the military authorities, to lack of inner\r\n    organization, and to other temporary causes, have reached such a\r\n    degree that the freedom won by the Revolution is seriously\r\n    endangered.\r\n\r\n    (2) That the sole salvation lies in establishing a government\r\n    enjoying the full confidence of the toiling masses, in the\r\n    awakening of a creative revolutionary enthusiasm, and in concerted\r\n    self-sacrificing work on the part of all the elements of the\r\n    population.\r\n\r\n    The convention extends to the Council of Workmen's and Soldiers'\r\n    Delegates its warmest appreciation of the latter's\r\n    self-sacrificing and honest work for the strengthening of the new\r\n    order in Russia, in the interests of the Russian Democracy and at\r\n    the same time wishes to see, in the nearest possible future, the\r\n    above Council transformed into an All-Russian Council of Workmen's\r\n    and Soldiers' Delegates.\r\n\r\n    _The convention is of the opinion that the war is at present\r\n    conducted for purposes of conquest and against the interests of\r\n    the masses_, and it, therefore, urges the Council of Workmen's and\r\n    Soldiers' Delegates to take the most energetic and effective\r\n    measures for the purpose of ending this butchery, on the basis of\r\n    free self-determination of nations and of renunciation by all\r\n    belligerent countries of annexations and indemnities. Not a drop\r\n    of Russian blood shall be given for aims foreign to us.\r\n\r\n    Considering that the earliest possible achievement of this purpose\r\n    is contingent only upon a strong revolutionary army, which would\r\n    defend freedom and government, and be fully supported by the\r\n    organized Revolutionary Democracy, that is, by the Council of\r\n    Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates, responsible for its acts to the\r\n    whole country, the convention welcomes the responsible decision of\r\n    the Council of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates to take part in\r\n    the new Provisional Government.\r\n\r\n    The convention demands that the representatives of the Church give\r\n    up for the country's benefit the treasures and funds now in the\r\n    possession of churches and monasteries. The convention makes an\r\n    urgent appeal to all parts of the population.\r\n\r\n    1. To the comrade-soldiers in the rear: Comrades! Come to fill up\r\n    our thinning ranks in the trenches and rise shoulder to shoulder\r\n    with us for the country's defense!\r\n\r\n    2. Comrade-workers! Work energetically and unite your efforts, and\r\n    in this way help us in our last fight for universal peace for\r\n    nations! By strengthening the front you will strengthen freedom!\r\n\r\n    3. Fellow-citizens of the capitalist class! Follow the historic\r\n    example of Minin! Even as he, open your treasuries and quickly\r\n    bring your money to the aid of Russia!\r\n\r\n    4. To the peasants: Fathers and Brothers! Bring your last mite to\r\n    help the weakening front! Give us bread, and oats and hay to our\r\n    horses. Remember that the future Russia will be yours!\r\n\r\n    5. Comrades-Intellectuals! Come to us and bring the light of\r\n    knowledge into our dark trenches! Share with us the difficult work\r\n    of advancing Russia's freedom and prepare us for the citizenship\r\n    of new Russia!\r\n\r\n    6. To the Russian women: Support your husbands and sons in the\r\n    performing of their civil duty to the country! Replace them where\r\n    this is not beyond your strength! Let your scorn drive away all\r\n    those who are slackers in these difficult times!\r\n\r\nNo one can read this declaration without a deep sense of the lofty and\r\nsincere citizenship of the brave men who adopted it as their expression.\r\nThe fundamental loyalty of these leaders of the common soldiers, their\r\nspokesmen and delegates, is beyond question. Pardonably weary of a war in\r\nwhich they had been more shamefully betrayed and neglected than any other\r\narmy in modern times, frankly suspicious of capitalist governments which\r\nhad made covenants with the hated Romanov dynasty, they were still far from\r\nbeing ready to follow the leadership of Bolsheviki. They had, instead,\r\nadopted the sanely constructive policy of Tchcheidze, Tseretelli, Skobelev,\r\nPlechanov, and other Socialists who from the first had seen the great\r\nstruggle in its true perspective. That they did not succeed in averting\r\ndisaster is due in part to the fact that the Revolution itself had come too\r\nlate to make military success possible, and in part to the failure of the\r\ngovernments allied with Russia to render intelligent aid.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nThe Provisional Government was reorganized. Before we consider the actions\r\nof the All-Russian Congress of Peasants' Delegates, one of the most\r\nimportant gatherings of representatives of Russian workers ever held, the\r\nreorganization of the Provisional Government merits attention. On the 17th,\r\nat a special sitting of the Duma, Guchkov and Miliukov explained why they\r\nhad resigned. Guchkov made it a matter of conscience. Anarchy had entered\r\ninto the administration of the army and navy, he said: \"In the way of\r\nreforms the new government has gone very far. Not even in the most\r\ndemocratic countries have the principles of self-government, freedom, and\r\nequality been so extensively applied in military life. We have gone\r\nsomewhat farther than the danger limit, and the impetuous current drives us\r\nfarther still.... I could not consent to this dangerous work; I could not\r\nsign my name to orders and laws which in my opinion would lead to a rapid\r\ndeterioration of our military forces. A country, and especially an army,\r\ncannot be administered on the principles of meetings and conferences.\"\r\n\r\nMiliukov told his colleagues of the Duma that he had not resigned of his\r\nown free will, but under pressure: \"I had to resign, yielding not to force,\r\nbut to the wish of a considerable majority of my colleagues. With a clear\r\nconscience I can say that I did not leave on my own account, but was\r\ncompelled to leave.\" Nevertheless, he said, the foreign policy he had\r\npursued was the correct one. \"You could see for yourselves that my activity\r\nin foreign politics was in accord with your ideas,\" he declared amid\r\napplause which eloquently testified to the approval with which the\r\nbourgeoisie regarded policies and tendencies which the proletariat\r\ncondemned. He pointed out that the pacifist policies of Zimmerwald and\r\nKeinthal had permeated a large part of the Socialist movement, and that the\r\nSoviet, the Councils of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates, claiming to\r\nexercise control over the Provisional Government, were divided. He feared\r\nthat the proposal to establish a Coalition Government would not lead to\r\nsuccess, because of \"discord in the Council of Workmen's and Soldiers'\r\nDelegates itself.\" Not all the members of the latter body were agreed upon\r\nentering into a Coalition Government, and \"it is evident that those who do\r\nnot enter the government will continue to criticize those who have entered,\r\nand it is possible that the Socialists who enter the Cabinet will find\r\nthemselves confronted with the same storm of criticism as the government\r\ndid before.\" Still, because it meant the creation of a stronger government\r\nat once, which was the most vital need, he, like Guchkov, favored a\r\ncoalition which would ally the Constitutional Democratic party with the\r\nmajority of the Socialists.\r\n\r\nThe Soviet had decided at its meeting on May 14th to participate in a\r\nCoalition Ministry. The struggle upon that question between Bolsheviki and\r\nMensheviki was long and bitter. The vote, which was forty-one in favor of\r\nparticipation to nineteen against, probably fairly represented the full\r\nstrength of Bolshevism in its stronghold. After various conferences between\r\nPremier Lvov and the other Ministers, on the one side, and representatives\r\nof the Soviet, on the other side, a new Provisional Government was\r\nannounced, with Prince Lvov again Prime Minister. In the new Cabinet there\r\nwere seven Constitutional Democrats, six Socialists, and two Octobrists. As\r\nMinister of War and head of the army and navy Alexander Kerensky took the\r\nplace of Guchkov, while P.N. Pereverzev, a clever member of the\r\nSocialist-Revolutionary party, succeeded Kerensky as Minister of Justice.\r\nIn Miliukov's position at the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was\r\nplaced M.I. Terestchenko, a wealthy sugar-manufacturer, member of the\r\nConstitutional-Democratic party, who had held the post of Minister of\r\nFinance, which was now given to A.I. Shingariev, a brilliant member of the\r\nsame party, who had proved his worth and capacity as Minister of\r\nAgriculture. To the latter post was appointed V.M. Chernov, the leader of\r\nthe Socialist-Revolutionists, one of the most capable Socialists in Russia,\r\nor, for that matter, the world. Other Socialists of distinction in the new\r\nProvisional Government were I.G. Tseretelli, as Minister of Posts and\r\nTelegraphs, and M.I. Skobelev, as Minister of Labor. As Minister of Supply\r\nan independent Socialist, A.V. Peshekhonov, was chosen.\r\n\r\nIt was a remarkable Cabinet. So far as the Socialists were concerned, it\r\nwould have been difficult to select worthier or abler representatives. As\r\nin the formation of the First Provisional Government, attempts had been\r\nmade to induce Tchcheidze to accept a position in the Cabinet, but without\r\nsuccess. He could not be induced to enter a Coalition Ministry, though he\r\nstrongly and even enthusiastically supported in the Soviet the motion to\r\nparticipate in such a Ministry. Apart from the regret caused by\r\nTchcheidze's decision, it was felt on every hand that the Socialists had\r\nsent into the Second Provisional Government their strongest and most\r\ncapable representatives; men who possessed the qualities of statesmen and\r\nwho would fill their posts with honorable distinction and full loyalty. On\r\nthe side of the Constitutional Democrats and the Octobrists, too, there\r\nwere men of sterling character, distinguished ability, and very liberal\r\nminds. The selection of Terestchenko as Minister of Foreign Affairs was by\r\nmany Socialists looked upon with distrust, but, upon the whole, the\r\nCoalition Ministry met with warm approbation. If any coalition of the sort\r\ncould succeed, the Cabinet headed by Prince Lvov might be expected to do\r\nso.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th, the Petrograd Council of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates\r\nadopted a resolution, introduced by Tchcheidze, president of the Council,\r\nwarmly approving the entrance of the Socialist Ministers into the Cabinet\r\nand accepting the declaration of the new Provisional Government as\r\nsatisfactory. This resolution was bitterly opposed by the Bolsheviki, who\r\nwere led in the fight by Trotzky. This was Trotzky's first speech in\r\nPetrograd since his arrival the previous day from America. His speech was a\r\ndemagogic appeal against co-operation with any bourgeois elements.\r\nParticipation in the Coalition Ministry by the Socialists was a dangerous\r\npolicy, he argued, since it sacrificed the fundamental principle of class\r\nstruggle. Elaborating his views further, he said: \"I never believed that\r\nthe emancipation of the working class will come from above. Division of\r\npower will not cease with the entrance of the Socialists into the Ministry.\r\nA strong revolutionary power is necessary. The Russian Revolution will not\r\nperish. But I believe only in a miracle from below. There are three\r\ncommandments for the proletariat. They are: First, transmission of power to\r\nthe revolutionary people; second, control over their own leaders; and\r\nthird, confidence in their own revolutionary powers.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the beginning of Trotzky's warfare upon the Coalition Government,\r\na warfare which he afterward systematically waged with all his might.\r\nTchcheidze and others effectively replied to the Bolshevik leader's\r\ncriticisms and after long and strenuous debate the resolution of the\r\nExecutive Committee presented by Tchcheidze was carried by a large\r\nmajority, the opposition only mustering seven votes. The resolution read as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    Acknowledging that the declaration of the Provisional Government,\r\n    which has been reconstructed and fortified by the entrance of\r\n    representatives of the Revolutionary Democracy, conforms to the\r\n    idea and purpose of strengthening the achievements of the\r\n    Revolution and its further development, the Council of Workmen's\r\n    and Soldiers' Delegates has determined:\r\n\r\n    I. Representatives of the Council of Workmen's and Soldiers'\r\n    Delegates must enter into the Provisional Government.\r\n\r\n    II. Those representatives of the Council of Workmen's and\r\n    Soldiers' Delegates who join the government must, until the\r\n    creation of an All-Russian organ of the Council of Workmen's and\r\n    Soldiers' Delegates, consider themselves responsible to the\r\n    Petrograd Council of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates, and must\r\n    pledge themselves to give accounts of all their activities to that\r\n    Council.\r\n\r\n    III. The Council of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates expresses\r\n    its full confidence in the new Provisional Government, and urges\r\n    all friends of democracy to give this government active\r\n    assistance, which will insure it the full measure of power\r\n    necessary for the safety of the Revolution's gains and for its\r\n    further development.\r\n\r\nIf there is any one thing which may be said with certainty concerning the\r\nstate of working-class opinion in Russia at that time, two months after the\r\noverthrow of the old régime, it is that the overwhelming majority of the\r\nworking-people, both city workers and peasants, supported the policy of the\r\nMensheviki and the Socialist-Revolutionists--the policy of co-operating\r\nwith liberal bourgeois elements to win the war and create a stable\r\ngovernment--as against the policy of the Bolsheviki. The two votes of the\r\nPetrograd Soviet told where the city workers stood. That very section of\r\nthe proletariat upon which the Bolsheviki leaders based their hopes had\r\nrepudiated them in the most emphatic manner. The Delegates of the Soldiers\r\nat the Front had shown that they would not follow the advice of the leaders\r\nof the Bolsheviki. And at the first opportunity which presented itself the\r\npeasants placed themselves in definite opposition to Bolshevism.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon preceding the action of the Soviet in giving its\r\nindorsement to the new Provisional Government and instructing its\r\nrepresentatives to enter the Coalition Cabinet, there assembled in the\r\nPeople's House, Petrograd, more than one thousand peasant delegates to the\r\nfirst All-Russian Congress of Peasants. Never before had so many peasant\r\ndelegates been gathered together in Russia to consider their special\r\nproblems. There were present delegates from every part of Russia, even from\r\nthe extreme border provinces, and many from the front. On the platform were\r\nthe members of the Organizing Committee, the Executive Committee of the\r\nCouncil of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates, the Socialist-Revolutionary\r\nparty, the Social Democratic party, and a number of prominent Socialist\r\nleaders. As might be expected in a peasants' Congress, members of the\r\nSocialist-Revolutionary party were in the majority, numbering 537. The next\r\nlargest group was the Social Democratic party, including Bolsheviki and\r\nMensheviki, numbering 103. There were 136 delegates described as\r\nnon-partizan; 4 belonged to the group called the \"People's Socialists\" and\r\n6 to the Labor Group. It was the most representative body of peasant\r\nworkers ever brought together.\r\n\r\nAmong the first speakers to address the Congress was the venerable\r\n\"Grandmother\" of the Russian Revolution, Catherine Breshkovskaya, who spoke\r\nwith the freedom accorded to her and to her alone. \"Tell me,\" she demanded,\r\n\"is there advantage to us in keeping our front on a war footing and in\r\nallowing the people to sit in trenches with their hands folded and to die\r\nfrom fever, scurvy, and all sorts of contagious diseases? If our army had a\r\nreal desire to help the Allies, the war would be finished in one or two\r\nmonths, _but we are prolonging it by sitting with our hands folded_.\" V.M.\r\nChernov, leader of the Socialist-Revolutionary party, the new Minister of\r\nAgriculture, made a notable address in which he traversed with great skill\r\nand courage the arguments of the Bolsheviki, making a superb defense of the\r\npolicy of participation in the government.\r\n\r\nKerensky, idol of the peasants, appearing for the first time as Minister of\r\nWar and head of the army and navy, made a vigorous plea for unity, for\r\nself-discipline, and for enthusiastic support of the new Provisional\r\nGovernment. He did not mince matters: \"I intend to establish an iron\r\ndiscipline in the army. I am certain that I shall succeed in my\r\nundertaking, because it will be a discipline based upon duty toward the\r\ncountry, the duty of honor.... By all means, we must see that the country\r\nbecomes free and strong enough to elect the Constituent Assembly, the\r\nAssembly which, through its sovereign, absolute power, will give to the\r\ntoiling Russian peasants that for which they have been yearning for\r\ncenturies, the land.... We are afraid of no demagogues, whether they come\r\nfrom the right or from the left. We shall attend to our business, quietly\r\nand firmly.\" Kerensky begged the peasants to assert their will that there\r\nshould be \"no repetition of the sad events of 1905-06, when the entire\r\ncountry seemed already in our hands, but slipped out because it became\r\ninvolved in anarchy.\" The speech created a profound impression and it was\r\nvoted to have it printed in millions of copies, at the expense of the\r\nCongress, and have them distributed throughout the army.\r\n\r\nA similar honor was accorded the speech of I.I. Bunakov, one of the best\r\nknown and most popular of the leaders of the Socialist-Revolutionary party.\r\nWith remorseless logic he traversed the arguments of the Bolsheviki and the\r\nPorazhentsi. Taking the cry that there must be \"no annexations,\" for\r\nexample, he declared that the peasants of Russia could only accept that in\r\nthe sense that Poland be reunited and her independence be restored; that\r\nthe people of Alsace and Lorraine be permitted to be reunited to France;\r\nthat Armenia be taken from Turkey and made independent. The peasants could\r\nnot accept the _status quo ante_ as a basis for peace. He assailed the\r\ntreacherous propaganda for a separate peace with terrific scorn: \"But such\r\npeace is unacceptable to us peasants. A separate peace would kill not only\r\nour Revolution, but the cause of social revolution the world over. A\r\nseparate peace is dishonor for Russia and treason toward the Allies.... We\r\nmust start an offensive. To remain in the trenches without moving is a\r\nseparate truce, more shameful even than a separate peace. A separate truce\r\ndemoralizes the army and ruins the people. This spring, according to our\r\nagreement with the Allies, we should have begun a general offensive, but\r\ninstead of that we have concluded a separate truce. _The Allies saved the\r\nRussian Revolution, but they are becoming exhausted_.... When our Minister\r\nof War, Kerensky, speaks of starting an offensive, the Russian army must\r\nsupport him with all its strength, with all the means available.... From\r\nhere we should send our delegates to the front and urge our army to wage an\r\noffensive. Let the army know that it must fight and die for Russia's\r\nfreedom, for the peace of the whole world, and for the coming Socialist\r\ncommonwealth.\"\r\n\r\nIn the resolutions which were adopted the Congress confined itself to\r\noutlining a program for the Constituent Assembly, urging the abolition of\r\nprivate property in land, forests, water-power, mines, and mineral\r\nresources. It urged the Provisional Government to \"issue an absolutely\r\nclear and unequivocal statement which would show that on this question the\r\nProvisional Government will allow nobody to oppose the people's will.\" It\r\nalso issued a special appeal \"to the peasants and the whole wage-earning\r\npopulation of Russia\" to vote at the forthcoming elections for the\r\nConstituent Assembly, \"only for those candidates who pledge themselves to\r\nadvocate the nationalization of the land without reimbursement on\r\nprinciples of equality.\" In the election for an Executive Committee to\r\ncarry on the work of the Congress and maintain the organization the\r\ndelegates with Bolshevist tendencies were \"snowed under.\" Those who were\r\nelected were, practically without exception, stalwart supporters of the\r\npolicy of participation in and responsibility for the Provisional\r\nGovernment, and known to be ardent believers in the Constituent Assembly.\r\nChernov, with 810 votes, led the poll; Breshkovskaya came next with 809;\r\nKerensky came third with 804; Avksentiev had 799; Bunakov 790; Vera Finger\r\n776, and so on. Nineteenth on the list of thirty elected came the venerable\r\nNicholas Tchaykovsky, well known in America. Once more a great\r\nrepresentative body of Russian working-people had spoken and rejected the\r\nteachings and the advice of the Bolsheviki.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, it was with the authority and mandate of the overwhelming\r\nmajority of the organized workers that the Socialists entered the Coalition\r\nMinistry. It was with that mandate that Kerensky undertook the Herculean\r\ntask of restoring the discipline and morale of the Russian army. In that\r\nwork he was the agent and representative of the organized working class.\r\nFor this reason, if for no other, Kerensky and his associates were entitled\r\nto expect and to receive the loyal support of all who professed loyalty to\r\nthe working class. Instead of giving that support, however, the Bolsheviki\r\ndevoted themselves to the task of defeating every effort of the Provisional\r\nGovernment to carry out its program, which, it must be borne in mind, had\r\nbeen approved by the great mass of the organized workers. They availed\r\nthemselves of every means in their power to hamper Kerensky in his work and\r\nto hinder the organization of the economic resources of the nation to\r\nsustain the military forces.\r\n\r\nKerensky had promised to organize preparations for a vigorous offensive\r\nagainst the Austro-German forces. That such offensive was needed was\r\nobvious and was denied by none except the ultra-pacifists and the\r\nBolsheviki. The Congress of Soldiers' Delegates from the Front and the\r\nPetrograd Soviet had specifically urged the need of such an offensive, as\r\nhad most of the well-known peasants' leaders. It was a working-class\r\npolicy. But that fact did not prevent the Bolsheviki from throwing\r\nobstacles in the way of its fulfilment. They carried on an active\r\npropaganda among the men in the army and the navy, urging insubordination,\r\nfraternization, and refusal to fight. They encouraged sabotage as a means\r\nof insuring the failure of the efforts of the Provisional Government. So\r\nthoroughly did they play into the hands of the German military authorities,\r\nwhether intentionally or otherwise, that the charge of being in the pay of\r\nGermany was made against them--not by prejudiced bourgeois politicians and\r\njournalists, but by the most responsible Socialists in Russia.\r\n\r\nThe epic story of Kerensky's magnificently heroic fight to recreate the\r\nRussian army is too well known to need retelling here. Though it was vain\r\nand ended in failure, as it was foredoomed to do, it must forever be\r\nremembered with gratitude and admiration by all friends of freedom. The\r\naudacity and the courage with which Kerensky and a few loyal associates\r\nstrove to maintain Russia in the struggle made the Allied nations, and all\r\nthe civilized world, their debtors. Many mistakes were made, it is true,\r\nyet it is very doubtful if human beings could have achieved more or\r\nsucceeded where they failed. It must be confessed, furthermore, that the\r\ngovernments of the nations with which they were allied made many grievous\r\nmistakes on their part.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest blunder that a discriminating posterity will charge to\r\nKerensky's account was the signing of the famous Declaration of Soldiers'\r\nRights. This document, which was signed on May 27th, can only be regarded\r\nin the light of a surrender to overpowering forces. In his address to the\r\nAll-Russian Congress of Peasants' Delegates, on May 18th, speaking for the\r\nfirst time in his capacity as Minister of War, Kerensky had declared, \"I\r\nintend to establish an iron discipline in the army,\" yet the Declaration of\r\nSoldiers' Rights which he signed nine days later was certain to make any\r\nreal discipline impossible. Was it because he was inconsistent,\r\nvacillating, and weak that Kerensky attached his name to such a document?\r\n\r\nSuch a judgment would be gravely unjust to a great man. The fact is that\r\nKerensky's responsibility was very small indeed. He and his Socialist\r\nassociates in the Cabinet held their positions by authority of the Council\r\nof Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates, and they had agreed to be subject to\r\nits guidance and instruction. The Soviet was responsible for the\r\nDeclaration of Soldiers' Rights. Kerensky was acting under its orders. The\r\nSoviet had already struck a fatal blow at military discipline by its famous\r\nOrder Number One, which called on the soldiers not to execute the orders of\r\ntheir officers unless the orders were first approved by the revolutionary\r\nauthorities--that is, by the Soviet or its accredited agents. That the\r\norder was prompted by an intense love for revolutionary ideals, or that it\r\nwas justified by the amount of treachery which had been discovered among\r\nthe officers of the army, may explain and even excuse it, but the fact\r\nremains that it was a deadly blow at military discipline. The fact that\r\nKerensky's predecessor, Guchkov, had to appear at a convention of soldiers'\r\ndelegates and explain and defend his policies showed that discipline was at\r\na low ebb. It brought the army into the arena of politics and made\r\nquestions of military strategy subject to political maneuvering.\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of Soldiers' Rights was a further step along a road which\r\ninevitably led to disaster. That remarkable document provided that soldiers\r\nand officers of all ranks should enjoy full civic and political rights;\r\nthat they should be free to speak or write upon any subject; that their\r\ncorrespondence should be uncensored; that while on duty they should be free\r\nto receive any printed matter, books, papers, and so on, which they\r\ndesired. It provided for the abolition of the compulsory salute to\r\nofficers; gave the private soldier the right to discard his uniform when\r\nnot actually on service and to leave barracks freely during \"off-duty\"\r\nhours. Finally, it placed all matters pertaining to the management in the\r\nhands of elective committees in the composition of which the men were to\r\nhave four-fifths of the elective power and the officers one-fifth.\r\n\r\nOf course, the Declaration of Soldiers' Rights represented a violent\r\nreaction. Under the old régime the army was a monstrously cruel machine;\r\nthe soldiers were slaves. At the first opportunity they had revolted and,\r\nas invariably happens, the pendulum had swung too far. On May 28th the\r\nCouncil of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates issued a declaration in which\r\nit was said: \"From now on the soldier-citizen is free from the slavery of\r\nsaluting, and as an equal, free person will greet whomsoever he chooses....\r\nDiscipline in the Revolutionary Army will exist, prompted by popular\r\nenthusiasm and the sense of duty toward the free country rather than by a\r\nslavish salute.\" If we are tempted to laugh at this naïve idealism, we\r\nAmericans will do well to remember that it was an American\r\nstatesman-idealist who believed that we could raise an army of a million\r\nmen overnight, and that a shrewd American capitalist-idealist sent forth a\r\n\"peace ship\" with a motley crew of dreamers and disputers to end the\r\ngreatest war in history.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nThroughout the first half of June, while arrangements for a big military\r\noffensive were being made, and were causing Kerensky and the other\r\nSocialist Ministers to strain every nerve, Lenine, Trotzky, Kamenev,\r\nZinoviev, and other leaders of the Bolsheviki were as strenuously engaged\r\nin denouncing the offensive and trying to make it impossible. Whatever gift\r\nor genius these men possessed was devoted wholly to destruction and\r\nobstruction. The student will search in vain among the multitude of records\r\nof meetings, conventions, debates, votes, and resolutions for a single\r\ninstance of participation in any constructive act, one positive service to\r\nthe soldiers at the front or the workers' families in need, by any\r\nBolshevik leader. But they never missed an opportunity to embarrass those\r\nwho were engaged in such work, and by so doing add to the burden that was\r\nalready too heavy.\r\n\r\nLenine denounced the offensive against Germany as \"an act of treason\r\nagainst the Socialist International\" and poured out the vials of his wrath\r\nagainst Kerensky, who was, as we know, simply carrying out the decisions of\r\nthe Soviet and other working-class organizations. Thus we had the\r\nastonishing and tragic spectacle of one Socialist leader working with\r\ntitanic energy among the troops who had been betrayed and demoralized by\r\nthe old régime, seeking to stir them into action against the greatest\r\nmilitarist system in the world, while another Socialist leader worked with\r\nmight and main to defeat that attempt and to prevent the rehabilitation of\r\nthe demoralized army. And all the while the German General Staff gloated at\r\nevery success of the Bolsheviki. There was a regular system of\r\ncommunications between the irreconcilable revolutionists and the German\r\nGeneral Staff. In proof of this statement only one illustration need be\r\noffered, though many such could be cited: At the All-Russian Congress of\r\nWorkmen's and Soldiers' Delegates, on June 22d, Kerensky read, in the\r\npresence of Lenine, a long message, signed by the commander-in-chief of the\r\nGerman eastern front, sent by wireless in response to a declaration of\r\ncertain delegates of the Council of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates.\r\n\r\nAt this session Lenine bitterly assailed the proposed offensive. He said\r\nthat it was impossible for either side to win a military victory, revamping\r\nall the defeatist arguments that were familiar in every country. He\r\nminimized the loss which Russia had suffered at Germany's hands, and the\r\ngains Germany had made in Belgium and northern France, pointing out that\r\nshe had, on the other hand, lost her colonies, which England would be very\r\nunlikely to give back unless compelled to do so by other nations. Taunted\r\nwith being in favor of a separate peace with Germany, Lenine indignantly\r\ndenied the accusation. \"It is a lie,\" he cried. \"Down with a separate\r\npeace! _We Russian revolutionists will never consent to it._\" He argued\r\nthat there could be only one policy for Socialists in any country--namely,\r\nto seize the occasion of war to overthrow the capitalist-class rule in that\r\ncountry. No war entered into by a capitalist ruling class, regardless what\r\nits motives, should be supported by Socialists. He argued that the adoption\r\nof his policy by the Russian working class would stand ten times the chance\r\nof succeeding that the military policy would have. The German working class\r\nwould compel their government and the General Staff to follow the example\r\nof Russia and make peace.\r\n\r\nKerensky was called upon to reply to Lenine. At the time when the\r\nrestoration of the army required all his attention and all his strength, it\r\nwas necessary for Kerensky to attend innumerable and well-nigh interminable\r\ndebates and discussions to maintain stout resistance to the Bolshevik\r\noffensive always being waged in the rear. That, of course, was part of the\r\nBolshevist plan of campaign. So Kerensky, wearied by his tremendous efforts\r\nto perform the task assigned him by the workers, answered Lenine. His reply\r\nwas a forensic masterpiece. He took the message of the commander-in-chief\r\nof the German eastern front and hurled it at Lenine's head, figuratively\r\nspeaking, showing how Lenine's reasoning was paralleled in the German\r\npropaganda. With merciless logic and incisive phrase he showed how the\r\nBolsheviki were using the formula, \"the self-determination of\r\nnationalities,\" as the basis of a propaganda to bring about the\r\ndismemberment of Russia and its reduction to a chaotic medley of small,\r\nhelpless states. To Lenine's statements about the readiness of the German\r\nworking class to rebel, Kerensky made retort that Lenine should have\r\nremained in Germany while on his way to Russia and preached his ideas\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nA few days earlier, at a session of the same Congress, Trotzky and Kamenev\r\nhad made vigorous assault upon the Coalition Government and upon the\r\nSocialist policy with reference thereto. In view of what subsequently\r\ntranspired, it is important to note that Trotzky made much of the delay in\r\ncalling together the Constituent Assembly: \"The policy of continual\r\npostponement _and the detailed preparations_ for calling the Constituent\r\nAssembly is a false policy. It may destroy even the very realization of the\r\nConstituent Assembly.\" This profession of concern for the Constituent\r\nAssembly was hypocritical, dishonest, and insincere. He did not in the\r\nleast care about or believe in the Constituent Assembly, and had not done\r\nso at any time since the First Revolution of 1905-06. His whole thought\r\nrejected such a democratic instrument. However, he and his associates knew\r\nthat the demand for a Constituent Assembly was almost universal, and that\r\nto resist that demand was impossible. Their very obvious policy in the\r\ncircumstances was to try and force the holding of the Assembly prematurely,\r\nwithout adequate preparation, and without affording an opportunity for a\r\nnation-wide electoral campaign. A hastily gathered, badly organized\r\nConstituent Assembly would be a mob-gathering which could be easily\r\nstampeded or controlled by a determined minority.\r\n\r\nTrotzky assailed the Coalition Government with vitriolic passion. At the\r\nmoment when it was obvious to everybody that unity of effort was the only\r\npossible condition for the survival of the Revolution, and that any\r\ndivision in the ranks of the revolutionists, no matter upon what it might\r\nbe based, must imperil the whole movement, he and all his Bolshevik\r\ncolleagues deliberately stirred up dissension. Even if their opposition to\r\npolitical union with non-proletarian parties was right as the basis of a\r\nsound policy, to insist upon it at the moment of dire peril was either\r\ntreachery or madness. When a house is already on fire the only thing in\r\norder, the only thing that can have the sanction of wisdom and honor, is to\r\nwork to extinguish the fire. It is obviously not the time to debate whether\r\nthe house was properly built or whether mistakes were made. Russia was a\r\nhouse on fire; the Bolsheviki insisted upon endless debating.\r\n\r\nKamenev followed Trotzky's lead in attacking the Coalition Government. In a\r\nsubtle speech he supported the idea of splitting Russia up into a large\r\nnumber of petty states, insisting that the formula, \"self-determination of\r\npeoples,\" applied to the separatist movement in the Ukraine. He insisted\r\nthat for the Russian working-people it was a matter of indifference whether\r\nthe Central Empires or the Entente nations won in the war. He argued that\r\nthe only hope for the Russian Revolution must be the support of the\r\nrevolutionary proletariat in the other European countries, particularly\r\nthose adjacent to Russia: \"If the revolutionary proletariat of Europe fails\r\nto support the Russian Revolution the latter will be ruined. As that\r\nsupport is the only guaranty of the safety of the Revolution, we cannot\r\nchange our policy by discussing the question of how much fraternizing will\r\nstimulate the awakening of the proletariat of Europe.\" In other words,\r\nKamenev was in the position of a desperate gambler who stakes his life and\r\nhis all upon one throw of the dice or one spin of the wheel.\r\n\r\nIt was in this manner that the Bolshevist leaders conspired to Russia's\r\ndestruction. They were absorbing the time and energies of the men who were\r\nreally trying to do something, compelling them to engage in numerous\r\nfutile debates, to the neglect of their vitally important work, debates,\r\nmoreover, which could have no other effect than to weaken the nation.\r\nFurther, they were actively obstructing the work of the government. Thus\r\nTseretelli, Kerensky, Skobelev, and many others whose efforts might have\r\nsaved the Revolution, were thwarted by men wholly without a sense of\r\nresponsibility. Lenine was shrieking for the arrest of capitalists because\r\nthey were capitalists, when it was obvious that the services of those same\r\ncapitalists were needed if the nation was to live. Later on, when\r\nconfronted by the realities and responsibilities of government, he availed\r\nhimself of the special powers and training of the despised capitalists. At\r\nthis earlier period he was, as Tseretelli repeatedly reminded the workers,\r\nwithout any sense of responsibility for the practical results of his\r\npropaganda. And that was equally true of the Bolsheviki as a whole. They\r\ntalked about sending \"ultimatums\" to the Allies, while the whole system of\r\nnational defense was falling to pieces. Tseretelli made the only reply it\r\nwas possible for a sane man to make:\r\n\r\n\"It is proposed that we speak to the Allies with ultimatums, but did those\r\nwho made this silly proposal think that this road might lead to the\r\nbreaking of diplomatic relations with the Allies, and to that very separate\r\npeace which is condemned by all factions among us? Did Lenine think of the\r\nactual consequences of his proposal to arrest several dozen capitalists at\r\nthis time? Can the Bolsheviki guarantee that their road will lead us to the\r\ncorrect solution of the crisis? No. If they guarantee this they do not know\r\nwhat they are doing and their guaranty is worthless. The Bolshevik road can\r\nlead us only to one end, civil war.\"\r\n\r\nOnce more the good sense of the working class prevailed. By an\r\noverwhelming majority of votes the Congress decided to uphold the Coalition\r\nGovernment and rejected the Bolshevik proposals. The resolution adopted\r\ndeclared that \"the passing over of all power to the bourgeoisie elements\r\nwould deal a blow at the revolutionary cause,\" but that equally the\r\ntransfer of all power to the Soviets would be disastrous to the Revolution,\r\nand \"would greatly weaken her powers by prematurely driving away from her\r\nelements which are still capable of serving her, and would threaten the\r\nruin of the Revolution.\" Therefore, having heard the explanations of the\r\nSocialist Ministers and having full confidence in them, the Congress\r\ninsisted that the Socialist Ministers be solely responsible to the\r\n\"plenipotentiary and representative organ of the whole organized\r\nRevolutionary Democracy of Russia, which organ must be composed of the\r\nrepresentatives of the All-Russian Congress of Councils of Workmen's and\r\nSoldiers' Delegates, as well as of representatives of the All-Russian\r\nCongress of Peasants' Delegates.\"\r\n\r\nBut in spite of the fact that the workers upon every opportunity repudiated\r\ntheir policies, the Bolsheviki continued their tactics. Lenine, Trotzky,\r\nTshitsherin, Zinoviev, and others called upon the workers to stop working\r\nand to go out into the streets to demonstrate for peace. The All-Russian\r\nCongress of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates issued an appeal to the\r\nworkers warning them not to heed the call of the Bolsheviki, which had been\r\nmade at the \"moment of supreme danger.\" The appeal said:\r\n\r\n    Comrades, in the name of millions of workers, peasants, and\r\n    soldiers, we tell you, \"Do not do that which you are called upon\r\n    to do.\" At this dangerous moment you are called out into the\r\n    streets to demand the overthrow of the Provisional Government, to\r\n    whom the All-Russian Congress has just found it necessary to give\r\n    its support. And those who are calling you cannot but know that\r\n    out of your peaceful demonstrations bloodshed and chaos may\r\n    result.... You are being called to a demonstration in favor of the\r\n    Revolution, _but we know that counter-revolutionists want to take\r\n    advantage of your demonstration ... the counter-revolutionists are\r\n    eagerly awaiting the moment when strife will develop in the ranks\r\n    of the Revolutionary Democracy and enable them to crush the\r\n    Revolution_.\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nNot only in this way were the Bolsheviki recklessly attempting to thwart\r\nthe efforts of the Socialist Ministers to carry out the mandates of the\r\nmajority of the working class of Russia, but they were equally active in\r\ntrying to secure the failure of the attempt to restore the army. All\r\nthrough June the Bolshevik papers denounced the military offensive. In the\r\nranks of the army itself a persistent campaign against further fighting was\r\ncarried on. The Duma had voted, on June 17th, for an immediate offensive,\r\nand it was approved by the Petrograd Soviet. The Provisional Government on\r\nthat date published a Note to the Allied governments, requesting a\r\nconference with a view to making a restatement of their war aims. These\r\nactions were approved by the All-Russian Congress of Workmen's and\r\nSoldiers' Delegates, as was also the expulsion from Russia of the Swiss\r\nSocialist, Robert Grimm, who was a notorious agent of the German\r\nGovernment. Grimm, as is now well known, was acting under the orders of\r\nHoffman, the Swiss Minister of Foreign Affairs, and was trying to bring\r\nabout a separate peace between Russia and Germany. He was also intimately\r\nconnected with the infamous \"Parvus,\" the trusted Social Democrat who was a\r\nspy and tool of the German Government. As always, the great majority of the\r\nrepresentatives of the actual working class of Russia took the sane\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nBut the Bolsheviki were meanwhile holding mass meetings among the troops,\r\npreaching defeatism and surrender and urging the soldiers not to obey the\r\norders of \"bourgeois\" officers. The Provisional Government was not blind to\r\nthe peril of this propaganda, but it dared not attempt to end it by force,\r\nconscious that any attempt to do so would provoke revolt which could not be\r\nstayed. The Bolsheviki, unable to control the Workmen's and Soldiers'\r\nCouncil, sought in every possible manner to weaken its influence and to\r\ndiscredit it. They conspired to overthrow the Provisional Government. Their\r\nplot was to bring about an armed revolt on the 24th of June, when the\r\nAll-Russian Congress of Soviets would be in session. They planned to arrest\r\nthe members of the Provisional Government and assume full power. _At the\r\nsame time, all the soldiers at the front were to be called on to leave the\r\ntrenches_. On the eve of the date when it was to be executed this plot was\r\ndivulged. There was treachery within their own ranks. The Bolshevik leaders\r\nhumbly apologized and promised to abandon their plans. Under other\r\nconditions the Provisional Government might have refused to be satisfied\r\nwith apologies, might have adopted far sterner measures, but it was face to\r\nface with the bitter fact that the nation was drunk with the strong wine of\r\nfreedom. The time had not yet arrived when the masses could be expected to\r\nrecognize the distinction between liberty within the law and the license\r\nthat leads always to tyranny. It takes time and experience of freedom to\r\nteach the stern lesson that, as Rousseau has it, freedom comes by way of\r\nself-imposed compulsions to be free.\r\n\r\nThe offensive which Kerensky had urged and planned began on July 1st and\r\nits initial success was encouraging. It seemed as though the miracle of the\r\nrestoration of the Russian army had been achieved, despite everything. Here\r\nwas an army whose killed and dead already amounted to more than three\r\nmillion men,[20] an army which had suffered incredible hardships, again\r\ngoing into battle with songs. On the 1st of July more than thirty-six\r\nthousand prisoners were taken by the Russians on the southwestern front.\r\nThen came the tragic harvest of the Bolshevist propaganda. In northeastern\r\nGalicia the 607th Russian Regiment left the trenches and forced other units\r\nto do the same thing, opening a clear way for the German advance. Regiment\r\nafter regiment refused to obey orders. Officers were brutally murdered by\r\ntheir men. Along a front of more than one hundred and fifty miles the\r\nRussians, greatly superior in numbers, retreated without attempting to\r\nfight, while the enemy steadily advanced. This was made possible by the\r\nagitation of the Bolsheviki, especially by the mutiny which they provoked\r\namong the troops in the garrison at Petrograd. On the 17th of July, at the\r\nvery time when the separatist movement in the Ukraine, the resignation of\r\nthe Constitutional Democrats from the government, and the revolt and\r\ntreachery among the troops had produced a grave crisis, seizing the\r\nopportunity afforded by the general chaos, the Bolsheviki attempted to\r\nrealize their aim of establishing what they called a \"dictatorship of the\r\nproletariat,\" but which was in reality the dictatorship of a small part of\r\nthe proletariat. There was no pretense that they represented a majority of\r\nthe proletariat, even. It was a desperate effort to impose the dictatorship\r\nof a small minority of the proletariat upon the whole nation. For two days\r\nthe revolt lasted, more than five hundred men, women, and children being\r\nkilled in the streets of Petrograd.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th Prince Lvov resigned as Premier. In the mean time the\r\nBolshevist uprising had been put down by Cossack troops and the leaders\r\nwere in hiding. Kerensky stepped into Lvov's position as Premier and\r\ncontinued to address himself to the task of bringing order out of the\r\nchaos. There could not have been any selfish ambition in this; no\r\nplace-hunter would have attempted to bear the heavy burden Kerensky then\r\nassumed, especially with his knowledge of the seriousness of the situation.\r\nHe knew that the undertaking was practically hopeless, yet he determined\r\nnever to give up the struggle so long as there was a single thing to be\r\ndone and his comrades desired him to do it.[21]\r\n\r\nThere had been created a revolutionary body representing all the organized\r\nworkers, called the United Executive Committee of the All-Russian Councils\r\nof Workmen's, Soldiers' and Peasants' Delegates, a body of more than three\r\nhundred elected representatives of the various Soviets. They represented\r\nthe views of many millions. This body vigorously denounced the Bolsheviki\r\nand rallied to the support of Kerensky and his colleagues. In a Manifesto\r\nto the people the Bolsheviki were charged with responsibility for the blood\r\nof all who had been slain in the uprising. On July 21st a second Manifesto\r\nwas issued by the Committee calling upon the workers to uphold the\r\ngovernment so long as the authorized representatives of the working class\r\ndetermined that to be the proper course to follow. The charge that Lenine,\r\nZinoviev, Trotzky, and others were acting under German instructions and\r\nreceiving German money spread until it was upon almost every tongue in\r\nPetrograd. On July 24th Gregory Alexinsky, a well-known Socialist, in his\r\npaper, _Bez Lisnih Slov_, published a circumstantial story of German\r\nintrigue in the Ukraine, revealed by one Yermolenko, an ensign in the 16th\r\nSiberian Regiment, who had been sent to Russia by the German Government.\r\nThis Yermolenko charged that Lenine had been instructed by the authorities\r\nin Berlin, just as he himself had been, and that Lenine had been furnished\r\nwith almost unlimited funds by the German Government, the arrangement being\r\nthat it was to be forwarded through one Svendson, at Stockholm.[22] By a\r\nvote of 300 to 11 the United Executive Committee of the All-Russian\r\nCouncils of Workmen's, Soldiers' and Peasants' Delegates adopted the\r\nfollowing resolution:\r\n\r\n    The whole Revolutionary Democracy desires that the Bolsheviki\r\n    group accused of having organized disorders, or inciting revolt,\r\n    or of having received money from German sources be tried publicly.\r\n    In consequence, the Executive Committee considers it absolutely\r\n    inadmissible that Lenine and Zinoviev should escape justice, and\r\n    demands that the Bolsheviki faction immediately and categorically\r\n    express its censure of the conduct of its leaders.\r\n\r\nLater on, under the \"terror,\" there was some pretense of an \"investigation\"\r\nof the charge that Lenine and others had received German money, but there\r\nhas never been a genuine investigation so far as is known. Groups of\r\nRussian Socialists belonging to various parties and groups have asked that\r\na commission of well-known Socialists from the leading countries of Europe\r\nand from the United States, furnished with reliable interpreters, be sent\r\nto Russia to make a thorough investigation of the charge.\r\n\r\nThe United Executive Committee of the workers' organizations adopted a\r\nresolution demanding that all members and all factions, and the members of\r\nall affiliated bodies, obey the mandate of the majority, and that all\r\nmajority decisions be absolutely obeyed. They took the position--too late,\r\nalas!--that the will of the majority must be observed, since the only\r\nalternative was the rule of the majority by the aggressive minority.\r\nRepressive measures against the Bolsheviki were adopted by the Kerensky\r\nCabinet with the full approval of the Committee. Some of the Bolshevik\r\npapers were suppressed and the death penalty, which had been abolished at\r\nthe very beginning of the Revolution, was partially restored in that it was\r\nordered that it should be applied to traitors and deserters at the front.\r\nLenine and Zinoviev were in hiding, but Trotzky, Kamenev, Alexandra\r\nKollontay, and many other noted Bolsheviki were imprisoned for a few days.\r\n\r\nIt was Kerensky's hope that by arranging for an early conference by the\r\nAllies, at which the war aims would be restated in terms similar to those\r\nwhich President Wilson had employed, and by definitely fixing the date for\r\nthe Constituent Assembly elections, September 30th, while sternly\r\nrepressing the Bolsheviki, it might be possible to save Russia. But it was\r\ntoo late. Despite his almost superhuman efforts, and the loyal support of\r\nthe great majority of the Soviets, he was defeated. Day after day\r\nconditions at the front grew worse. By the beginning of August practically\r\nthe whole of Galicia was in the hands of the Germans. Russian soldiers in\r\nlarge numbers retreated before inferior numbers of Germans, refusing to\r\nstrike a blow. Germans furnished them with immense quantities of spirits,\r\nand an orgy of drunkenness took place. The red flag was borne by debauched\r\nand drunken mobs. What a fate for the symbol of universal freedom and\r\nhuman brotherhood!\r\n\r\nIt was a time of terrible strain and upheaval. Crisis followed upon crisis.\r\nChernov resigned his position as Minister of Agriculture. Kerensky resigned\r\nas Premier, but the members of the Provisional Government by unanimous vote\r\ndeclined to accept the resignation. They called a joint meeting of all the\r\nCabinet, of leaders of all political parties, of the Duma, of the Soviets\r\nof workers, peasants, and soldiers. At this meeting the whole critical\r\nsituation was discussed and all present joined in demanding that Kerensky\r\ncontinue in office. The political parties represented were the Social\r\nDemocrats, the Socialist-Revolutionists, the Democratic Radicals, the Labor\r\nUnion party, the Popular Socialists, and the Constitutional Democrats. From\r\nthese groups came an appeal which Kerensky could not deny. He said:\r\n\r\n\"In view of the evident impossibility of establishing, by means of a\r\ncompromise between the various political groups, Socialist as well as\r\nnon-Socialist, a strong revolutionary government ... I was obliged to\r\nresign. Friday's conference, ... after a prolonged discussion, resulted in\r\nthe parties represented at the conference deciding to intrust me with the\r\ntask of reconstructing the government. Considering it impossible for me in\r\nthe present circumstances, when defeat without and disintegration within\r\nare threatening the country, to withdraw from the heavy task which is now\r\nintrusted to me, I regard this task as an express order of the country to\r\nconstruct a strong revolutionary government in the shortest possible time\r\nand in spite of all the obstacles which might arise.\"\r\n\r\nFor the second time Kerensky was Premier at the head of a Coalition\r\nMinistry. No other government was possible for Russia except a strong\r\ndespotism. Theorists might debate the advisability of such coalition, but\r\nthe stern reality was that nothing else was possible. The leader of the\r\npeasants, Chernov, returned to his old post as Minister of Agriculture and\r\nthe Constitutional Democrats took their share of the burden. There were six\r\nparties and groups in the new Cabinet, four of them of various shades of\r\nSocialism and two of them liberal bourgeoisie. Never before, perhaps, and\r\ncertainly only rarely, if ever, have men essayed a heavier or more\r\ndifficult task than that which this new Provisional Government undertook.\r\n\r\nHeroically Kerensky sought to make successful the efforts of General\r\nKornilov, as commander-in-chief, to restore order and discipline in the\r\narmy, but it was too late. The disintegration had gone too far. The\r\nmeasures which the Revolutionary Democracy had introduced into the army, in\r\nthe hope of realizing freedom, had reduced it to a wild mob. Officers were\r\nbutchered by their men; regiment after regiment deserted its post and, in\r\nsome instances, attempted to make a separate peace with the enemy, even\r\noffering to pay indemnities. Moreover, the industrial organization of the\r\ncountry had been utterly demoralized. The manufacture of army supplies had\r\nfallen off more than 60 per cent., with the result that the state of\r\naffairs was worse than in the most corrupt period of the old régime.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nIt became evident to the Provisional Government that something big and\r\ndramatic must be done, without waiting for the results of the Constituent\r\nAssembly elections. Accordingly, it was decided to call together a great\r\nextraordinary council, representing all classes and all parties, to\r\nconsider the situation and the best means of meeting it. The Extraordinary\r\nNational Conference, as it was called, was opened in Moscow, on August\r\n26th, with more than fourteen hundred members in attendance. Some of these\r\nmembers--principally those from the Soviets--had been elected as delegates,\r\nbut the others had been invited by the government and could not be said to\r\nspeak as authorized representatives. There were about one hundred and\r\nninety men who had been members of one or other of the Dumas; one hundred\r\nrepresentatives of the peasants' Soviets and other peasant organizations;\r\nabout two hundred and thirty representatives of the Soviets of industrial\r\nworkers and of soldiers; more than three hundred from co-operatives; about\r\none hundred and eighty from the trade-unions; about one hundred and fifty\r\nfrom municipalities; one hundred and fifty representatives of banks and\r\nindustrial concerns, and about one hundred and twenty from the Union of\r\nZemstvos and Towns. It was a Conference more thoroughly representative of\r\nRussia than any that had ever been held. There were, indeed, no\r\nrepresentatives of the old régime, and there were few representatives of\r\nthe Bolsheviki. The former had no place in the new Russia that was\r\nstruggling for its existence; the repressive measures that had been found\r\nnecessary accounted for the scant representation of the latter.\r\n\r\nIt was to this Conference that President Wilson sent his famous message\r\ngiving the assurance of \"every material and moral assistance\" to the people\r\nand government of Russia. For three days the great assembly debated and\r\nlistened to speeches from men representing every section of the country,\r\nevery class, and every party. Kerensky, Tseretelli, Tchcheidze, Boublikov,\r\nPlechanov, Kropotkin, Breshkovskaya, and others, spoke for the workers;\r\nGeneral Kornilov and General Kaledine spoke for the military command;\r\nMiliukov, Nekrasov, Guchkov, Maklakov, and others spoke for the\r\nbourgeoisie. At times feeling ran high, as might have been expected, but\r\nthroughout the great gathering there was displayed a remarkable unanimity\r\nof feeling and immediate purpose; a common resolve to support the\r\nProvisional Government, to re-establish discipline in the army and navy, to\r\nremain loyal to the Allies, and reject with scorn all offers of a separate\r\npeace, and to work for the success of the Constituent Assembly.\r\n\r\nBut, notwithstanding the unity upon these immediately vital points, the\r\nMoscow Conference showed that there was still a great gulf between the\r\nclasses, and that no matter how they might co-operate to meet and overcome\r\nthe peril that hung over the nation like the sword of Damocles, there could\r\nbe no unity in working out the great economic and social program which must\r\nbe the basis for the Social Democratic commonwealth which the workers\r\nsought to establish, and which the bourgeois elements feared almost as much\r\nas they feared the triumph of Germany. In some respects the Conference\r\nintensified class feeling and added to, instead of lessening, the civil\r\nstrife. The Bolsheviki were not slow to exploit this fact. They pointed to\r\nthe Conference as evidence of a desire on the part of the Socialist\r\nMinisters, and of the officials of the Soviets, to compromise with the\r\nbourgeoisie. This propaganda had its effect and Bolshevism grew in\r\nconsequence, especially in Petrograd.\r\n\r\nThen followed the disastrous military and political events which made it\r\npractically impossible for the Kerensky government to stand. At the front\r\nthe soldiers were still revolting, deserting, and retreating. Kornilov was\r\nquite helpless. Germany began a new offensive, and on September 2d German\r\narmies crossed the Dvina near Riga. On September 3d Riga was surrendered to\r\nthe Germans in the most shameful manner and panic reigned in Petrograd.\r\nThen on the 9th came the revolt of Kornilov against the Provisional\r\nGovernment and the vulgar quarrel between him and Kerensky. Kornilov\r\ncharged that the Provisional Government, under pressure from the\r\nBolsheviki, was playing into the hands of the German General Staff.\r\nKerensky, backed by the rest of the Cabinet, ordered Kornilov's removal,\r\nwhile Kornilov despatched a division of troops, drawn from the front,\r\nagainst Petrograd.\r\n\r\nIt was a most disastrous conflict for which no adequate explanation can be\r\nfound except in the strained mental condition of all the principal parties\r\nconcerned. In less strenuous times, and in a calmer atmosphere, the two\r\nleaders, equally patriotic, would have found no difficulty in removing\r\nmisunderstandings. As things were, a mischievous intermediary, and two men\r\nsuffering the effects of a prolonged and intense nervous strain, provided\r\nall the elements of a disaster. Kornilov's revolt was crushed without great\r\ntrouble and with very little bloodshed, Kornilov himself being arrested.\r\nThe Soviets stood by the Provisional Government, for they saw in the revolt\r\nthe attempt to set up a personal dictatorship. Even the Bolsheviki were\r\ntemporarily sobered by the sudden appearance of the \"man on horseback.\"\r\nKerensky, by direction of his colleagues, became commander-in-chief of the\r\nRussian armies. Always, it seemed, through every calamity, all parties\r\nexcept the Bolsheviki agreed that he was the one man strong enough to\r\nundertake the heaviest and hardest tasks.\r\n\r\nToward the end of September what may be termed the Kerensky régime entered\r\nupon its last phase. For reasons which have been already set forth, the\r\nBolsheviki kept up a bitter attack upon the Provisional Government, and\r\nupon the official leaders of the Soviets, on account of the Moscow\r\nConference. They demanded that the United Executive Committee of the\r\nSoviets convoke a new Conference. They contended that the Moscow Conference\r\nhad been convoked by the government, not by the Soviets, and that the\r\nUnited Executive Committee must act for the latter. The United Executive\r\nCommittee complied and summoned a new National Democratic Conference, which\r\nassembled on September 27th. By this time, as a result of the exhaustion of\r\nthe patience of many workers, many of the Soviets had ceased to exist,\r\nwhile others existed on paper only. According to the _Izvestya Soveta_,\r\nthere had been more than eight hundred region organizations at one time,\r\nmany scores of which had disappeared. According to the same authority, the\r\npeasants were drawing away from the Workers' and Soldiers' Soviets. The\r\nUnited Executive Committee, which had been elected in June, was, of course,\r\ndominated by anti-Bolsheviki--that is, by Menshevik Social Democrats and by\r\nSocialist-Revolutionists.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic Conference was not confined to the Soviets. It embraced\r\ndelegates from Soviets of peasants, soldiers, and industrial workers; from\r\nmunicipalities, from zemstvos, co-operatives, and other organizations. It\r\ndiffered from the Moscow Conference principally in that the delegates were\r\nelected and that it did not include so many representatives of the\r\ncapitalist class. The petty bourgeoisie was represented, but not the great\r\ncapitalists. There were more than a thousand members in attendance at this\r\nDemocratic Conference, which was dominated by the most moderate section of\r\nthe Social Democrats. The Socialist-Revolutionists were not very numerous.\r\n\r\nThis Conference created another Coalition Cabinet, the last of the Kerensky\r\nrégime. Kerensky continued as Premier and as commander-in-chief of the\r\narmy. There were in the Cabinet five Social Democrats, two\r\nSocialist-Revolutionists, eight Constitutional Democrats, and two\r\nnon-partisans. It was therefore as far as its predecessors from meeting the\r\nstandards insisted upon by many radical Socialists, who, while not\r\nBolsheviki, still believed that there should be at least an absolute\r\nSocialist predominance in the Provisional Government. Of course, the new\r\nCoalition Ministry infuriated the Bolsheviki. From his hiding-place Lenine\r\nissued a series of \"Letters to the Comrades,\" which were published in the\r\n_Rabochiy Put_, in which he urged the necessity of an armed uprising like\r\nthat of July, only upon a larger scale. In these letters he scoffed at the\r\nConstituent Assembly as a poor thing to satisfy hungry men. Meanwhile,\r\nTrotzky, out of prison again, and other Bolshevik leaders were agitating by\r\nspeeches, proclamations, and newspaper articles for an uprising. The\r\nProvisional Government dared not try to suppress them. Its hold upon the\r\npeople was now too weak.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic Conference introduced one innovation. It created a\r\nPreliminary Parliament, as the new body came to be known, though its first\r\nofficial title was the Provisional Council of the Republic. This new body\r\nwas to function as a parliament until the Constituent Assembly convened,\r\nwhen it would give place to whatever form of parliamentary body the\r\nConstituent Assembly might create. This Preliminary Parliament and its\r\nfunctions were thus described:\r\n\r\n    This Council, in which all classes of the population will be\r\n    represented, and in which the delegates elected to the Democratic\r\n    Conference will also participate, will be given the right of\r\n    addressing questions to the government and of securing replies to\r\n    them in a definite period of time, of working out legislative acts\r\n    and discussing all those questions which will be presented for\r\n    consideration by the Provisional Government, as well as those\r\n    which will arise on its own initiative. Resting on the\r\n    co-operation of such a Council, the government, preserving, in\r\n    accordance with its pledge, the unity of the governmental power\r\n    created by the Revolution, will regard it its duty to consider the\r\n    great public significance of such a Council in all its acts up to\r\n    the time when the Constituent Assembly gives full and complete\r\n    representation to all classes of the population of Russia.\r\n\r\nThis Preliminary Parliament was really another Duma--that is, it was a very\r\nlimited parliamentary body. Its life was short and quite uneventful. It\r\nassembled for the first time on October 8th and was dispersed by the\r\nBolsheviki on November 7th. When it assembled there were 555 members--the\r\nnumber fixed by the decree of the Provisional Government. Of these, 53 were\r\nBolsheviki, but these withdrew almost at the opening with three others,\r\nthus reducing the actual membership of the body to less than five hundred.\r\nEven with the Bolsheviki withdrawn, when Kerensky appeared before the\r\nPreliminary Parliament on November 6th and made his last appeal, a\r\nresolution expressing confidence in his government was carried only by a\r\nsmall majority. Only about three hundred members were in attendance on this\r\noccasion, and of these 123 voted the expression of confidence, while 102\r\nvoted against it, and 26 declined to vote at all.\r\n\r\nThe Bolsheviki had forced the United Executive Committee to convene a new\r\nAll-Russian Congress of Soviets, and the date of its meeting had been fixed\r\nat November 7th. While the elections and arrangements for this Congress\r\nwere proceeding, the Bolsheviki were actively and openly organizing an\r\nuprising. In their papers and at their meetings they announced that on\r\nNovember 7th there would be an armed uprising against the government. Their\r\nintentions were, therefore, thoroughly well known, and it was believed that\r\nthe government had taken every necessary step to repress any attempt to\r\ncarry those intentions into practice. It was said that of the delegates to\r\nthe All-Russian Congress of Soviets-numbering 676 as against more than one\r\nthousand at the former Congress of peasant Soviets alone--a majority were\r\nBolsheviki. It was charged that the Bolsheviki had intimidated many workers\r\ninto voting for their candidates; that they had, in some instances, put\r\nforward their men as anti-Bolsheviki and secured their election by false\r\npretenses; that they had practised fraud in many instances. It was quite\r\ncertain that a great many Soviets had refused to send delegates, and that\r\nmany thousands of workers, and these all anti-Bolsheviki, had simply grown\r\nweary and disgusted with the whole struggle. Whatever the explanation might\r\nbe, the fact remained that of the 676 delegates 390 were generally rated as\r\nBolsheviki, while 230 were Socialist-Revolutionists and Mensheviki. Not all\r\nof the Socialist-Revolutionists could be counted as anti-Bolsheviki,\r\nmoreover. There were fifty-six delegates whose position was not quite\r\nclearly defined, but who were regarded as being, if not Bolsheviki, at\r\nleast anti-government. For the first time in the whole struggle the\r\nBolsheviki apparently had a majority of delegates in a working-class\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 6th, a few hours before the opening of the Congress of\r\nSoviets, the Bolsheviki struck the blow they had been so carefully\r\nplanning. They were not met with the resistance they had expected--for\r\nreasons which have never been satisfactorily explained. Kerensky recognized\r\nthat it was useless for him to attempt to carry on the fight. The\r\nBolsheviki had organized their Red Guards, and these, directed by military\r\nleaders, occupied the principal government buildings, such as the central\r\ntelephone and telegraph offices, the military-staff barracks, and so on.\r\nPart of the Petrograd garrison joined with the Bolsheviki, the other part\r\nsimply refusing to do anything. On the morning of November 7th the members\r\nof the Provisional Government were arrested in the Winter Palace, but\r\nKerensky managed to escape. The Bolshevik _coup d'état_ was thus\r\naccomplished practically without bloodshed. A new government was formed,\r\ncalled the Council of People's Commissaries, of which Nikolai Lenine was\r\nPresident and Leon Trotzky Commissioner for Foreign Affairs. The\r\n\"dictatorship of the proletariat\" was thus begun. Kerensky's attempt to\r\nrally forces enough to put an end to this dictatorship was a pathetic\r\nfailure, as it was bound to be. It was like the last fitful flicker with\r\nwhich a great flame dies. The masses wanted peace--for that they would\r\ntolerate even a dictatorship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE BOLSHEVIK WAR AGAINST DEMOCRACY\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe defenders and supporters of the Bolsheviki have made much of the fact\r\nthat there was very little bloodshed connected with the successful\r\nBolshevik uprising in Petrograd. That ought not to be permitted, however,\r\nto obscure the fundamental fact that it was a military _coup d'état_, the\r\ntriumph of brute force over the will of the vast majority of the people. It\r\nwas a crime against democracy. That the people were passive, worn out, and\r\ndistracted, content to wait for the Constituent Assembly, only makes the\r\nBolshevik crime appear the greater. Let us consider the facts very briefly.\r\nLess than three weeks away was the date set for the Constituent Assembly\r\nelections. Campaigns for the election of representatives to that great\r\ndemocratic convention were already in progress. It was to be the most\r\ndemocratic constitutional convention that ever existed in any country, its\r\nmembers being elected by the entire population, every man and woman in\r\nRussia being entitled to vote. The suffrage was equal, direct, universal,\r\nand secret.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there was a great democratic reconstruction of the nation\r\nactually in progress at the time. The building up of autonomous democratic\r\nlocal governing bodies, in the shape of a new type of zemstvos, was rapidly\r\nprogressing. The old-time zemstvos had been undemocratic and did not\r\nrepresent the working-people, but the new zemstvos were composed of\r\nrepresentatives nominated and elected by universal suffrage, equal, secret,\r\nand direct. Instead of being very limited in their powers as the old\r\nzemstvos were, the new zemstvos were charged with all the ordinary\r\nfunctions of local government. The elections to these bodies served as an\r\nadmirable practical education in democracy, making it more certain than\r\nwould otherwise have been the case that the Russian people would know how\r\nto use their new political instrument so as to secure a Constituent\r\nAssembly fully representing their will and their desire.\r\n\r\nAt the same time active preparations for holding the election of members to\r\nthe Constituent Assembly were actually under way. The Socialist parties\r\nwere making special efforts to educate the illiterate voters how to use\r\ntheir ballots correctly. The Provisional Government, on its part, was\r\npushing the preparations for the elections as rapidly as possible. All over\r\nthe country special courts were established, in central places, to train\r\nthe necessary workers so that the elections might be properly conducted.\r\nAbove all, the great problem of the socialization of the land which had\r\nbeen agitated for so many years had now reached the stage at which its\r\nsolution might almost have been said to be complete. The National Soviet of\r\nPeasants, together with the Socialist Revolutionary party, had formulated a\r\nlaw on the subject which represented the aspiration and the best thought of\r\nthe leaders of the peasants' movement. That law had been approved in the\r\nCouncil of Ministers and was ready for immediate promulgation. Peasant\r\nleaders like Chernov, Rakitnikov, Vikhiliaev, and Maslov had put an immense\r\namount of work into the formulation of this law, which aimed to avoid\r\nanarchy, to see to it that instead of an individualistic scramble by the\r\npeasants for the land, in small and unorganized holdings, the problem\r\nshould be scientifically dealt with, lands being justly distributed among\r\nthe peasant communes, and among the peasants who had been despoiled, and\r\nlarge estates co-operatively organized and managed.\r\n\r\nAll this the Bolsheviki knew, for it was common knowledge. There is no\r\ntruth whatever in the claim set up by many of the apologists for the\r\nBolsheviki that they became enraged and resorted to desperate tactics\r\nbecause nothing effective was being done to realize the aims of the\r\nRevolution, to translate its ideals into fact. Quite the contrary is true.\r\n_The Bolshevik insurrection was precipitated by its leaders precisely\r\nbecause they saw that the Provisional Government was loyally and\r\nintelligently carrying out the program of the Revolution, in co-operation\r\nwith the majority of the working-class organizations and their leaders._\r\n\r\nThe Bolsheviki did not want the ideals of the Revolution to be realized,\r\nfor the very simple reason that they were opposed to those ideals. In all\r\nthe long struggle from Herzen to Kerensky the revolutionary movement of\r\nRussia had stood for political democracy first of all. Now, at the moment\r\nwhen political democracy was being realized, the Bolsheviki sought to kill\r\nit and to set up something else--namely, a dictatorship of a small party of\r\nless than two hundred thousand over a nation of one hundred and eighty\r\nmillions. There can be no dispute as to this aim; it has been stated by\r\nLenine with great frankness. \"_Just as one hundred and fifty thousand\r\nlordly landowners under Czarism dominated the one hundred and thirty\r\nmillions of Russian peasants, so two hundred thousand members of the\r\nBolshevik party are imposing their proletarian will on the mass, but this\r\ntime in the interest of the latter._\"[23]\r\n\r\nLenine's figures probably exaggerate the Bolshevik numbers, but, assuming\r\nthem to be accurate, can anybody in his right mind, knowing anything of the\r\nhistory of the Russian revolutionary movement, believe that the\r\nsubstitution of a ruling class of one hundred and fifty thousand by one of\r\ntwo hundred thousand, to govern a nation of one hundred and eighty\r\nmillions, was the end to which so many lives were sacrificed? Can any sane\r\nand sincere person believe that the class domination described by the great\r\narch-Bolshevik himself comes within measurable distance of being as much of\r\na realization of the ideals of the Revolution as did the Constituent\r\nAssembly plan with its basis of political democracy, universal, equal,\r\ndirect, secret, all-determining suffrage? We do not forget Lenine's\r\nstatement that this new domination of the people by a ruling minority\r\ndiffers from the old régime in that the Bolsheviki are imposing their will\r\nupon the mass \"_in the interest of the latter_.\" What ruling class ever\r\nfailed to make that claim? Was it not the habit of the Czars, all of them,\r\nduring the whole revolutionary epoch, to indulge in the pious cant of\r\nproclaiming that they were motived only by their solicitude for the\r\ninterests and well-being of the peasants?\r\n\r\nIt is a curious illustration of the superficial character of the Bolshevist\r\nmentality that a man so gifted intellectually as Lenine undoubtedly is\r\nshould advance in justification of his policy a plea so repugnant to\r\nmorality and intelligence, and that it should be quietly accepted by men\r\nand women calling themselves radical revolutionists. Some years ago a\r\nwell-known American capitalist announced with great solemnity that he and\r\nmen like himself were the agents of Providence, charged with managing\r\nindustry \"for the good of the people.\" Naturally, his naïve claim provoked\r\nthe scornful laughter of every radical in the land. Yet, strange as it may\r\nseem, whenever I have pointed out to popular audiences that Lenine asserted\r\nthe right of two hundred thousand proletarians to impose their rule upon\r\nRussia, always, without a single exception, some defender of the\r\nBolsheviki--generally a Socialist or a member of the I.W.W.--has entered\r\nthe plea, \"Yes, but it is for the good of the people!\"\r\n\r\nIf the Bolsheviki had wanted to see the realization of the ideals of the\r\nRevolution, they would have found in the conditions existing immediately\r\nprior to their insurrection a challenge calling them to the service of the\r\nnation, in support of the Provisional Government and the Preliminary\r\nParliament. They would have permitted nothing to imperil the success of the\r\nprogram that was so well advanced. As it was, determination to defeat that\r\nprogram was their impelling motive. Not only did they fear and oppose\r\n_political_ democracy; they were equally opposed to democracy in\r\n_industry_, to that democracy in the economic life of the nation which\r\nevery Socialist movement in the world had at all times acknowledged to be\r\nits goal. As we shall see, they united to political dictatorship industrial\r\ndictatorship. They did not want democracy, but power; they did not want\r\npeace, even, as they wanted power.\r\n\r\nThe most painstaking and sympathetic study of the Russian Revolution will\r\nnot disclose any great ideal or principle, moral or political, underlying\r\nthe distinctive Bolshevik agitation and program. Nothing could well be\r\nfarther from the truth than the view taken by many amiable people who,\r\nwhile disavowing the actions of the Bolsheviki, seek to mitigate the\r\njudgment which mankind pronounces against them by the plea that, after\r\nall, they are extreme idealists, misguided, of course, but, nevertheless,\r\ninspired by a noble ideal; that they are trying, as John Brown and many\r\nothers have tried, to realize a great ideal, but have been made incapable\r\nof seeing their ideal in its proper perspective, and, therefore, of making\r\nthe compromises and adjustments which the transmutation of ideals to\r\nreality always requires.\r\n\r\nNo sympathizer with Russia--certainly no Socialist--can fail to wish that\r\nthis indulgent criticism were true. Its acceptance would lighten the\r\ndarkest chapter in Russian history, and, at the same time, remove from the\r\ngreat international Socialist movement a shameful reproach. But the facts\r\nare incompatible with such a theory. Instead of being fanatical idealists,\r\nincapable of compromises and adjustments, the Bolsheviki have, from the\r\nvery beginning, been loudly scornful of rigid and unbending idealism; have\r\nmade numerous compromises, alliances, and \"political deals,\" and have\r\nrepeatedly shifted their ground in accordance with political expediency.\r\nThey have been consistently loyal to no aim save one--the control of power.\r\nThey have been opportunists of the most extreme type. There is not a single\r\nSocialist or democratic principle which they have not abandoned when it\r\nserved, their political ends; not a single instrument, principle, or device\r\nof autocratic despotism which they have not used when by so doing they\r\ncould gain power. For the motto of Bolshevism we might well paraphrase the\r\nwell-known line of Horace, and make it read, \"Get power, honestly, if you\r\ncan, if not--somehow or other.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, this judgment applies only to Bolshevism as such: to the special\r\nand peculiar methods and ideas which distinguish the Bolsheviki from their\r\nfellow-Socialists. It is not to be questioned that as Socialists and\r\nrevolutionists they have been inspired by some of the great ideals common\r\nto all Socialists everywhere. But they differed from the great mass of\r\nRussian Socialists so fundamentally that they separated themselves from\r\nthem and became a separate and distinct party. _That which caused this\r\nseparation is the essence of Bolshevism--not the ideals held in common_. No\r\nunderstanding of Bolshevism is possible unless this fundamental fact is\r\nfirst fully understood. Power, to be gained at any cost, and ruthlessly\r\napplied, by the proletarian minority, is the basic principle of Bolshevism\r\nas a distinct form of revolutionary movement. Of course, the Bolshevik\r\nleaders sought this power for no sordid, self-aggrandizing ends; they are\r\nnot self-seeking adventurers, as many would have us believe. They are\r\nsincerely and profoundly convinced that the goal of social and economic\r\nfreedom and justice can be more easily attained by their method than by the\r\nmethod of democratic Socialism. Still, the fact remains that what social\r\nideals they hold are no part of Bolshevism. They are Socialist ideals.\r\nBolshevism is a distinctive method and a program, and its essence is the\r\nrelentless use of power by the proletariat against the rest of society in\r\nthe same manner that the bourgeois and military rulers of nations have\r\ncommonly used it against the proletariat. Bolshevism has simply inverted\r\nthe old Czarist régime.\r\n\r\nThe fairness and justice of this judgment are demonstrated by the\r\nBolsheviki themselves. They denounced Kerensky's government for not holding\r\nthe elections for the Constituent Assembly sooner, posing as the champions\r\nof the Constituante. When they had themselves assumed control of the\r\ngovernment they delayed the meeting of the Constituent Assembly and then\r\nsuppressed it by force of arms! They denounced Kerensky for having\r\nrestored the death penalty in the army in cases of gross treachery,\r\nprofessing an intense horror of capital punishment as a form of \"bourgeois\r\nsavagery.\" When they came into power they instituted capital punishment for\r\n_civil_ and _political offenses_, establishing public hangings and\r\nfloggings as a means of impressing the population![24] They had bitterly\r\nassailed Kerensky for his \"militarism,\" for trying to build up the army and\r\nfor urging men to fight. In less critical circumstances they themselves\r\nresorted to forced conscription. They condemned Kerensky and his colleagues\r\nfor \"interfering with freedom of speech and press.\" When they came into\r\npower they suppressed all non-Bolshevist papers and meetings in a manner\r\ndiffering not at all from that of the Czar's régime, forcing the other\r\nSocialist parties and groups to resort to the old pre-Revolution\r\n\"underground\" methods.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of all these things, and things even worse than these, is\r\nconclusive and unimpeachable. It is contained in the records of the\r\nBolshevik government, in its publications, and in the reports of the great\r\nSocialist parties of Russia, officially made to the International Socialist\r\nBureau. Surely the evidence sustains the charge that, whatever else they\r\nmay or may not be, the Bolsheviki are not unbending and uncompromising\r\nidealists of the type of John Brown and William Lloyd Garrison, as they are\r\nso often represented as being by well-meaning sentimentalists whose\r\nindulgence of the Bolsheviki is as unlimited as their ignorance concerning\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSome day, perhaps, a competent psychologist will attempt the task of\r\nexplaining the psychology of our fellow-citizens who are so ready to defend\r\nthe Bolsheviki for doing the very things they themselves hate and condemn.\r\nIn any list of men and women in this country friendly to the Bolsheviki it\r\nwill be found that they are practically all pacifists and\r\nanti-conscriptionists, while a great many are non-resistants and\r\nconscientious objectors to military service. Practically all of them are\r\nvigorous defenders of the freedom of the press, of the right of public\r\nassemblage and of free speech. With the exception of a few Anarchists, they\r\nare almost universally strong advocates of radical political democracy. How\r\ncan high-minded and intelligent men and women--as many of them are--holding\r\nsuch beliefs as these give countenance to the Bolsheviki, who bitterly and\r\nresolutely oppose all of them? How can they denounce America's adoption of\r\nconscription and say that it means that \"Democracy is dead in America\"\r\nwhile, at the same time, hailing the birth of democracy in Russia, where\r\nconscription is enforced by the Bolsheviki? How, again, can they at one and\r\nthe same time condemn American democracy for its imperfections, as in the\r\nmatter of suffrage, while upholding and defending the very men who, in\r\nRussia, deliberately set out to destroy the universal equal suffrage\r\nalready achieved? How can they demand freedom of the press and of\r\nassemblage, even in war-time, and denounce such restrictions as we have had\r\nto endure here in America, and at the same time uphold the men responsible\r\nfor suppressing the press and public assemblages in Russia in a manner\r\nworse than was attempted by the Czar? Is there no logical sense in the\r\naverage radical's mind? Or can it be that, after all, the people who make\r\nup the Bolshevist following, and who are so much given to engaging in\r\nprotest demonstrations of various kinds, are simply restless, unanchored\r\nspirits, for whom the stimulant and excitation of revolt is a necessity?\r\nHow many are simply victims of subtle neuroses occasioned by sex\r\nderangements, by religious chaos, and similar causes?\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe Bolshevik rule began as a reign of terror. We must not make the mistake\r\nof supposing that it was imposed upon the rest of Russia as easily as it\r\nwas imposed upon Petrograd, where conditions were exceptional. In the\r\nlatter city, with the assistance of the Preobrajenski and Seminovsky\r\nregiments from the garrison, and of detachments of sailors from the Baltic\r\nfleet, to all of whom most extravagant promises were made, the _coup\r\nd'état_ was easily managed with little bloodshed. But in a great many other\r\nplaces the Bolshevist rule was effected in no such peaceful fashion, but by\r\nmeans of a bloody terror. Here, for example, is the account of the manner\r\nin which the counter-revolution of the Bolsheviki was accomplished at\r\nSaratov, as given by a competent eye-witness, a well-known Russian\r\nSocialist whose long and honorable service in the revolutionary movement\r\nentitles her to the honor of every friend of Free Russia--Inna\r\nRakitnikov:[25]\r\n\r\n    Here ... is how the Bolshevist _coup d'état_ took place at\r\n    Saratov. I was witness to these facts myself. Saratov is a big\r\n    university and intellectual center, possessing a great number of\r\n    schools, libraries, and divers associations designed to elevate\r\n    the intellectual standard of the population. The Zemstvo of\r\n    Saratov was one of the best in Russia. The peasant population of\r\n    this province, among whom the revolutionary Socialist propaganda\r\n    was carried on for several years, by the Revolutionary Socialist\r\n    party, is wide awake and well organized. The Municipality and the\r\n    Agricultural Committees were composed of Socialists. The\r\n    population was actively preparing for the elections to the\r\n    Constituent Assembly; the people discussed the list of candidates,\r\n    studied the candidates' biographies, as well as the programs of\r\n    the different parties. On the night of October 28th [November\r\n    10th, European calendar], by reason of an order that had come from\r\n    Petrograd, the Bolshevik _coup d'état_ broke out at Saratov. The\r\n    following forces were its instruments: the garrison, which was a\r\n    stranger to the mass of the population, a weak party of workers,\r\n    and, in the capacity of leaders, some Intellectuals, who, up to\r\n    that time, had played no rôle in the public life of the town.\r\n\r\n    It was indeed a military _coup d'état. The city hall, where sat\r\n    the Socialists, who were elected by equal, direct, and secret\r\n    universal suffrage, was surrounded by soldiers; machine-guns were\r\n    placed in front and the bombardment began. This lasted a whole\r\n    night; some were wounded, some killed_. The municipal judges were\r\n    arrested. Soon after a Manifesto solemnly announced to the\r\n    population that the \"enemies of the people,\" the\r\n    \"counter-revolutionaries,\" were overthrown; that the power of\r\n    Saratov was going to pass into the hands of the Soviet\r\n    (Bolshevist) of the Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the overthrow of the existing authorities was effected and the\r\nBolsheviki, through their Red Guards and other means, were in a position to\r\nexert their authority, they resorted to every method of oppression and\r\nrepression known to the old autocratic régime. They suppressed the papers\r\nof the Socialist parties and groups opposed to them, and in some instances\r\nconfiscated the plants, turned out the editors, and used the papers\r\nthemselves. In one of his \"Letters to the Comrades,\" published in the\r\n_Rabochiy Put_, a few days before the insurrection, Lenine had confessed\r\nthat Kerensky had maintained freedom of the press and of assemblage. The\r\npassage is worth quoting, not only for the information it contains\r\nconcerning the Kerensky régime, but also because it affords a standard by\r\nwhich to judge the Bolsheviki. Lenine wrote:\r\n\r\n    The Germans have only one Liebknecht, no newspapers, no freedom of\r\n    assemblage, no councils; they are working against the intense\r\n    hostility of all classes of the population, including the wealthy\r\n    peasants--with the imperialist bourgeoisie splendidly\r\n    organized--and yet the Germans are making some attempt at\r\n    agitation; _while we, with tens of papers, with freedom of\r\n    assemblage, with the majority of the Council with us, we, the best\r\n    situated of all the proletarian internationalists, can we refuse\r\n    to support the German revolutionists in organizing a revolt?_\r\n\r\nThat it was not the \"German revolutionists\" who in November, 1917, wanted\r\nthe Russians to revolt against the Kerensky government, but the Majority\r\nSocialists, upon whom Lenine had poured his contempt, on the one hand, and\r\nthe German General Staff, on the other hand, is a mere detail. The\r\nimportant thing is that Lenine admitted that under the Kerensky government\r\nthe Russian workers, including the Bolsheviki, were \"the best situated of\r\nall the proletarian internationalists,\" and that they had \"tens of papers,\r\nwith freedom of assemblage.\" In the face of such statements by Lenine\r\nhimself, written a few days before the Bolshevik counter-revolution, what\r\nbecomes of the charge that the suppression of popular liberties under\r\nKerensky was one of the main causes of the revolt of the Bolsheviki?\r\n\r\nAgainst the tolerance of Kerensky, the arbitrary and despotic methods of\r\nthe Bolsheviki stand out in strong contrast. Many non-Bolshevist Socialist\r\norgans were suppressed; papers containing matter displeasing to the\r\nBolshevik authorities were suspended, whole issues were confiscated, and\r\neditors were imprisoned, precisely as in the days of the Czar. It became\r\nnecessary for the Socialist-Revolutionists to issue their paper with a\r\ndifferent title, and from a different place, every day. Here is the\r\ntestimony of Inna Rakitnikov again, contained in an official report to the\r\nInternational Socialist Bureau:\r\n\r\n    All the non-Bolshevik newspapers were confiscated or prosecuted\r\n    and deprived of every means of reaching the provinces; their\r\n    editors' offices and printing-establishments were looted. After\r\n    the creation of the \"Revolutionary Tribunal\" the authors of\r\n    articles that were not pleasing to the Bolsheviki, as well as the\r\n    directors of newspapers, were brought to judgment and condemned to\r\n    make amends or go to prison, etc.\r\n\r\n    The premises of numerous organizations were being constantly\r\n    pillaged. The Red Guard came there to search, destroying different\r\n    documents; frequently objects which were found on the premises\r\n    disappeared. Thus were looted the premises of the Central\r\n    Committee of the Revolutionary Socialist party (27 Galernaia\r\n    Street) and--several times--the office of the paper _Dielo Naroda_\r\n    (22 Liteinia Street) ... the office of the paper Volya Naroda,\r\n    etc.... But the Central Committee ... continued to issue a daily\r\n    paper, only changing its title, as in the time of Czarism, and\r\n    thus continued its propaganda....\r\n\r\nThe _Yolya Naroda_, referred to by Inna Rakitnikov, was the official organ\r\nof the Socialist-Revolutionary party. It was raided on several occasions.\r\nFor example, in January, 1918, the leaders of the party reported that a\r\ndetachment of Bolshevik Red Guards had broken into the office of the paper,\r\ncommitted various depredations, and made several arrests.[26] Here is\r\nanother Socialist witness: One of the ablest of the leaders of the Bohemian\r\nSocialists in the United States is Joseph Martinek, the brilliant and\r\nscholarly editor of the Bohemian Socialist weekly, the _Delnicke Listy_. He\r\nhas always been identified with the radical section of the movement. A\r\nstudent of Russian history, speaking the language fluently, it was his good\r\nfortune to spend several weeks in Petrograd immediately before and after\r\nthe Bolshevik counter-revolution. He testifies that the \"freedom of the\r\npress established by Kerensky\" was \"terminated by the Bolsheviki.\"[27]\r\nThis is not the testimony of \"capitalist newspapers,\" but of Socialists of\r\nunquestionable authority and standing. The _Dielo Naroda_ was a Socialist\r\npaper, and the volunteer venders of it, who were brutally beaten and shot\r\ndown by Red Guards, were Socialist working-men.[28] When Oskar Tokoi, the\r\nwell-known revolutionary Finnish Socialist leader, former Prime Minister of\r\nFinland, declares that \"freedom of assemblage, association, free speech,\r\nand free press is altogether destroyed,\"[29] the Bolsheviki and their\r\nsympathizers cannot plead that they are the victims of \"capitalist\r\nmisrepresentation.\" The attitude of the Bolshevik leaders toward the\r\nfreedom of the press has been frankly stated editorially in Pravda, their\r\nofficial organ, in the following words:\r\n\r\n    The press is a most dangerous weapon in the hands of our enemies.\r\n    We will tear it from them, we will reduce it to impotence. It is\r\n    the moment for us to prepare battle. We will be inflexible in our\r\n    defense of the rights of the exploited. The struggle will be\r\n    decisive. We are going to smite the journals with fines, to shut\r\n    them up, to arrest the editors, and hold them as hostages.[30]\r\n\r\nIs it any wonder that Paul Axelrod, who was one of the representatives of\r\nRussia on the International Socialist Bureau prior to the outbreak of the\r\nwar, has been forced to declare that the Bolsheviki have \"introduced into\r\nRussia a system worse than Czarism, suppressing the Constituent Assembly\r\nand the liberty of the press\"?[31] Or that the beloved veteran of the\r\nRussian Revolution, Nicholas Tchaykovsky, should lament that \"the\r\nBolshevik usurpation is the continuation of the government by which Czarism\r\nheld the country in an iron grip\"?[32]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nLenine, Trotzky, Zinoviev, and other Bolshevik leaders early found\r\nthemselves so much at variance with the accepted Socialist position that\r\nthey decided to change their party name. They had been Social Democrats, a\r\npart of the Social Democratic party of Russia. Now ever since Bronterre\r\nO'Brien first used the terms \"Social Democrat\" and \"Social Democracy,\" in\r\n1839, their meaning has been pretty well established. A Social Democrat is\r\none who aims to base government and industry upon democracy. Certainly,\r\nthis cannot be said to be an accurate description of the position of men\r\nwho believe in the rule of a nation of one hundred and eighty millions by a\r\nsmall party of two hundred thousand or less--or even by an entire class\r\nrepresenting not more than six per cent. of the population--and Lenine and\r\nhis friends, recognizing the fact, decided to change the name of their\r\ngroup to the _Communist party_, by which name they are now known in Russia.\r\nLenine frankly admits that it would be a mistake to speak of this party as\r\na party of democracy. He says:\r\n\r\n    The word \"democracy\" cannot be scientifically applied to the\r\n    Communist party. Since March, 1917, the word democracy is simply a\r\n    shackle fastened upon the revolutionary nation and preventing it\r\n    from establishing boldly, freely, and regardless of all obstacles\r\n    a new form of power; the Council of Workmen's, Soldiers' and\r\n    Peasants' Deputies, harbinger of the abolition of every form of\r\n    authority.[33]\r\n\r\nThe phrase \"harbinger of the abolition of every form of authority\" would\r\nseem to indicate that Lenine's ideal is that of the old Nihilists--or of\r\nAnarchists of the Bakuninist school. That is very far from the truth. The\r\nphrase in question is merely a rhetorical flourish. No man has more\r\ncaustically criticized and ridiculed the Anarchists for their dream of\r\norganization without authority than Nikolai Lenine. Moreover, his\r\nconception of Soviet government provides for a very strong central\r\nauthority. It is a new kind of state, but a state, nevertheless, and, as we\r\nshall discover, far more powerful than the political state with which we\r\nare familiar, exercising far greater control over the life of the\r\nindividual. It is not to be a democratic state, but a very despotic one, a\r\ndictatorship by a small but powerful ruling class. It was not the word\r\n\"democracy\" which Lenine felt to be a \"shackle upon the revolutionary\r\nnation,\" but democracy itself.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which they betrayed the Constituent Assembly will prove the\r\ncomplete hostility of the Bolsheviki to democratic government. In order to\r\nexcuse and justify the Bolsheviki's actions in this regard, their\r\nsupporters in this country have assiduously circulated two statements. They\r\nare, first, that the Provisional Government purposely and with malicious\r\nintent delayed the convocation of the Constituent Assembly, hoping to stave\r\nit off altogether; second, that such a long time had elapsed between the\r\nelections and the convocation that when the latter date was reached the\r\ndelegates no longer represented the true feeling of the electorate.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the first of these statements, which is a repetition of a\r\ncharge made by Trotzky before the Bolshevik revolt, it is to be noted that\r\nit is offered in justification of the Bolshevik _coup d'état_. If the\r\ncharge made were true, instead of false, as it can easily be shown to be,\r\nit would only justify the counter-revolution if the counter-revolution\r\nitself were made the instrument for insuring the safety of the Constituent\r\nAssembly. But the Bolsheviki _suppressed the Constituent Assembly_. By what\r\nprocess of reasoning do we reach the result that because the Provisional\r\nGovernment delayed the convocation of the Constituent Assembly, which the\r\npeople desired, a counter-revolutionary movement to _suppress it\r\naltogether_, by force of arms, was right and proper?\r\n\r\nWith regard to the second statement, which is a repetition of an argument\r\nadvanced in Russia, it should be sufficient to emphasize a few dates. The\r\nBolsheviki seized the power of government on November 7th and the elections\r\nfor the Constituent Assembly took place on November 25th--nearly three\r\nweeks later. The date set by the Kerensky government for the opening of the\r\nConstituent Assembly was December 12th and on that date some forty-odd\r\nmembers put in an appearance. Recognizing that they could not begin\r\nbusiness until a quorum appeared, these decided to wait until at least a\r\nquorum should be present. They did not attempt to do any work. What\r\nhappened is told in the following passages from a signed statement by 109\r\nmembers--all Socialist-Revolutionists.[34]\r\n\r\n    On the appointed day and hour of the opening of the session of the\r\n    Constituent Assembly ... the delegates to the Constituent Assembly\r\n    who had arrived in Petrograd gathered at the Tavrichesky Palace.\r\n    The elected representatives of the people beheld innumerable\r\n    banners and large crowds surrounding the palace. This was\r\n    Petrograd greeting the representatives of the people. At the doors\r\n    of the palace the picture changed. There stood armed guards and at\r\n    the orders of the usurpers, the Bolsheviki, they refused to let\r\n    the delegates pass into the Tavrichesky Palace. It appeared that,\r\n    in order to enter the building, the _delegates had first to pay\r\n    respects to the Commissaire, a satellite of Lenine and Trotzky,\r\n    and there receive special permission_. The delegates would not\r\n    submit to that; elected by the people and equipped with formal\r\n    authorization, they had the right to freely enter any public\r\n    building assigned for their meeting. The delegates decided to\r\n    enter the Tavrichesky Palace without asking the new authorities,\r\n    and they succeeded in doing so. On the first day the guards did\r\n    not dare to lift their arms against the people's elected\r\n    representatives and allowed them to enter the building without\r\n    molestation.\r\n\r\n    There was no struggle, no violence, no sacrifices; the delegates\r\n    demanded that the guards respect their rights; they demanded to be\r\n    admitted, and the guards yielded.\r\n\r\n    In the Tavrichesky Palace the delegates opened their meeting; V.M.\r\n    Chernov was elected chairman. There were, altogether, about forty\r\n    delegates present. They realized that there were not enough\r\n    present to start the work of the Constituent Assembly. _It was\r\n    decided that it would be advisable to await the arrival of the\r\n    other delegates and start the work of the Constituent Assembly\r\n    only when a sufficient number were present_. Those already there\r\n    decided to meet daily at the Tavrichesky Palace in order to count\r\n    all the delegates as they arrived, and on an appointed day to\r\n    publicly announce the day and hour of the beginning of the\r\n    activities of the Constituent Assembly.\r\n\r\n    When the delegates finished their session and adjourned, the old\r\n    guards had been dismissed for their submissive attitude toward the\r\n    delegates and replaced by armed civilian followers of Lenine and\r\n    Trotzky. The latter issued an order to disband the delegates, but\r\n    there were none to be disbanded.\r\n\r\n    The following day the government of the Bolsheviki dishonestly and\r\n    basely slandered the people's representatives in their official\r\n    announcement which appeared in Pravda. That lying newspaper wrote\r\n    that the representatives of the people had forced their way into\r\n    the palace, accompanied by Junkers and the White Guards of the\r\n    bourgeoisie, that the representatives wanted to take advantage of\r\n    their small numbers and had begun the work of the Constituent\r\n    Assembly. Every one knows that this is slanderous as regards the\r\n    representatives of the people. Such lies and slanders were\r\n    resorted to by the old régime.\r\n\r\n    The aim of the slanders and the lies is clear. _The usurpers do\r\n    not want the people's representatives to have the supreme power\r\n    and therefore are preparing to disband the Constituent Assembly_.\r\n    On the 28th of November, in the evening, _having begun to arrest\r\n    members of the Constitutional-Democratic party, the Bolsheviki\r\n    violated the inviolability of the Constituent Assembly. On\r\n    December 3d a delegate to the Constituent Assembly, the\r\n    Socialist-Revolutionist, Filippovsky, who was elected by the army\r\n    on the southwestern front, was arrested_.\r\n\r\n    In accordance with their decision reached on November 28th, the\r\n    delegates gathered at the Tavrichesky Palace on November 29th and\r\n    30th. As on the first day, armed soldiers stood guard at the\r\n    entrance of the palace and would not let any one pass. The\r\n    delegates, however, insisted and were finally allowed to enter.\r\n\r\n    On the third day, scenes of brutal violence toward the people's\r\n    representatives took place at the palace. Peasants were the\r\n    unfortunate victims of this violence.\r\n\r\n    When the delegates had ended their session and all that remained\r\n    was the affixing of the signatures to the minutes, sailors forced\r\n    their way into the hall; these were headed by a Bolshevik officer,\r\n    _a former commander of the Fortress of St. Peter and St. Paul_.\r\n    The commander demanded that the delegates disband. In reply it was\r\n    stated that the delegates would disband after they had finished\r\n    their business. Then at the order of the commander the sailors\r\n    took the delegate Ilyan, elected by the peasants of the Province\r\n    of Tambov, by the arm and dragged him to the exit. After Ilyan,\r\n    the sailors dragged out the peasant delegate from the Province of\r\n    Moscow, Bikov; then the sailors approached Maltzev, a peasant\r\n    delegate from the Province of Kostroma. He, however, shouted out\r\n    that he would rather be shot than to submit to such violence. His\r\n    courage appealed to the sailors and they stopped.\r\n\r\n    Now all the halls in the Tavrichesky Palace are locked and it is\r\n    impossible to meet there. The delegates who come to the\r\n    Tavrichesky Palace cannot even gather in the lobby, for as soon\r\n    as a group gathers, the armed hirelings of Lenine and Trotzky\r\n    disperse them. Thus, in former times, behaved the servants of the\r\n    Czar and the enemies of the people, policemen and gendarmes.\r\n\r\nThis is not the testimony of correspondents of bourgeois journals; it is\r\nfrom a statement prepared at the time and signed by more than a hundred\r\nSocialists, members of the oldest and largest Socialist party in Russia,\r\nmany of them men whose long and honorable service has endeared them to\r\ntheir comrades in all lands. It is not testimony that can be impeached or\r\ncontroverted. It forms part of the report of these well-known and trusted\r\nSocialists to their comrades in Russia and elsewhere. The claim that the\r\nelections to the Constituent Assembly were held on the basis of an obsolete\r\nregister, before the people had a chance to become acquainted with the\r\nBolshevist program, and that so long a time had elapsed since the elections\r\nthat the delegates could not be regarded as true representatives of the\r\npeople, was first put forward by the Bolsheviki when the Constituent\r\nAssembly was finally convened, on January 18th. It was an absurd claim for\r\nthe Bolsheviki to make, for one of the very earliest acts of the Bolshevik\r\ngovernment, after the overthrow of Kerensky, was to issue a decree ordering\r\nthat the elections be held as arranged. By that act they assumed\r\nresponsibility for the elections, and could not fairly and honorably enter\r\nthe plea, later on, that the elections were not valid.\r\n\r\nHere is the story of the struggle for the Constituent Assembly, briefly\r\nsummarized. The first Provisional Government issued a Manifesto on March\r\n20, 1917, promising to convoke the Constituent Assembly \"as soon as\r\npossible.\" This promise was repeated by the Provisional Government when it\r\nwas reorganized after the resignation of Miliukov and Guchkov in the\r\nmiddle of May. That the promise was sincere there can be no reasonable\r\ndoubt, for the Provisional Government at once set about creating a\r\ncommission to work out the necessary machinery and was for the election by\r\npopular vote of delegates to the Constituent Assembly. Russia was not like\r\na country which had ample electoral machinery already existing; new\r\nmachinery had to be devised for the purpose. This commission was opened on\r\nJune 7, 1917; its work was undertaken with great earnestness, and completed\r\nin a remarkably short time, with the result that on July 22d the\r\nProvisional Government--Kerensky at its head--announced that the elections\r\nto the Constituent Assembly would be held on September 30th, and the\r\nconvocation of the Assembly itself on the 12th of December. It was soon\r\nfound, however, that it would be physically impossible for the local\r\nauthorities all to be prepared to hold the election on the date set--it was\r\nnecessary, among other things, to first elect the local authorities which\r\nwere to arrange for the election of the delegates to the Constituent\r\nAssembly--and so, on August 22d, Kerensky signed the following decree,\r\nmaking _the one and only postponement_ of the Constituent Assembly, so far\r\nas the Provisional Government was concerned:\r\n\r\n    Desiring to assure the convocation of the Constituent Assembly as\r\n    soon as possible, the Provisional Government designated the 30th\r\n    of September as election-day, in which case the whole burden of\r\n    making up the election lists must fall on the municipalities and\r\n    the newly elected zemstvos. _The enormous labor of holding the\r\n    elections for the local institution has taken time_. At present,\r\n    in view of the date of establishment of the local institutions, on\r\n    the basis decreed by the government--direct, general, equal, and\r\n    secret suffrage--the Provisional Government has decided:\r\n\r\n    To set aside as the day for the elections to the Constituent\r\n    Assembly the 25th of November, of the year 1917, and as the date\r\n    for the convocation of the Constituent Assembly the 12th of\r\n    December, of the year 1917.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this clear and honorable record, we find Trotzky, at a\r\nConference of Northern Councils of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates, on\r\nOctober 25th, when he well knew that arrangements for holding the\r\nConstituent Assembly elections were in full swing, charging that Kerensky\r\nwas engaged in preventing the convocation of the Constituent Assembly! He\r\ndemanded at that time that all power should be taken from the Provisional\r\nGovernment and transferred to the Soviets. These, he said, would convoke\r\nthe Assembly on the date that had been assigned, December 12th.\r\n\r\nThe Bolshevik _coup d'état_ took place, as already noted, less than three\r\nweeks before the date set for the elections, for which every preparation\r\nhad been made by the government and the local authorities. It was at the\r\nbeginning of the campaign, and the Bolsheviki had their own candidates in\r\nthe field in many places. It was a foregone conclusion that the Constituent\r\nAssembly brought into being by the universal suffrage would be dominated by\r\nSocialists. There was never the slightest fear that it would be dominated\r\nby the bourgeois parties. What followed is best told in the exact language\r\nof a protest to the International Socialist Bureau by Inna Rakitnikov,\r\nrepresentative of the Revolutionary Socialist party, which was, be it\r\nremembered, the largest and the oldest of the Russian Socialist parties:\r\n\r\n    The _coup d'état_ was followed by various other manifestations of\r\n    Bolshevist activity--arrests, searches, confiscation of\r\n    newspapers, ban on meetings. Bands of soldiers looted the country\r\n    houses in the suburbs of the city; a school for the children of\r\n    the people and the buildings of the Children's Holiday Settlement\r\n    were also pillaged. Bands of soldiers were forthwith sent into the\r\n    country to cause trouble there.... The bands of soldiers who were\r\n    sent into the country used not only persuasion, but also violence,\r\n    _trying to force the peasants to give their votes for the\r\n    Bolshevik candidates at the time of the elections to the\r\n    Constituent Assembly; they tore up the bulletins of the\r\n    Socialist-Revolutionists, overturned the ballot-boxes, etc_....\r\n    The inhabitants of the country proved themselves in all that\r\n    concerned the elections wide awake to the highest degree. There\r\n    were hardly any abstentions; _90 per cent. of the population took\r\n    part in the voting_. The day of the voting was kept as a solemn\r\n    feast; the priest said mass; the peasants dressed in their best\r\n    clothes; they believed that the Constituent Assembly would give\r\n    them order, laws, the land. In the Government of Saratov, out of\r\n    fourteen deputies elected, there were twelve\r\n    Socialist-Revolutionists. There were others (such as the\r\n    Government of Pensa, for example) that elected only\r\n    Socialist-Revolutionists. The Bolsheviki had the majority only in\r\n    Petrograd and Moscow and in certain units of the army. To violence\r\n    and conquest of power by force of arms the population answered by\r\n    the elections to the Constituent Assembly, the people sent to this\r\n    Assembly, not the Bolsheviki, but, by an overwhelming majority,\r\n    Socialist-Revolutionists.\r\n\r\nOf course, this is the testimony of one who is confessedly anti-Bolshevist,\r\none who has suffered deep injury at the hands of the Bolsheviki of whom she\r\nwrites. For all that, her testimony cannot be ignored or laughed aside. It\r\nhas been indorsed by E. Roubanovitch, a member of the International\r\nSocialist Bureau, and a man of the highest integrity, in the following\r\nwords: \"I affirm that her sincere and matured testimony cannot be suspected\r\nof partizanship or of dogmatic partiality against the Bolsheviki.\" What is\r\nmore important, however, is that the subsequent conduct of the Bolsheviki\r\nin all matters relating to the Constituent Assembly was such as to confirm\r\nbelief in her statements.\r\n\r\nNo Bolshevik spokesman has ever yet challenged the accuracy of the\r\nstatement that an overwhelming majority of the deputies elected to the\r\nConstituent Assembly were representatives of the Revolutionary Socialist\r\nparty. As a matter of fact, the Bolsheviki elected less than one-third of\r\nthe deputies. In the announcement of their withdrawal from the Constituent\r\nAssembly when it assembled in January the Bolshevik members admitted that\r\nthe Socialist-Revolutionists had \"obtained a majority of the Constituent\r\nAssembly.\"\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the Bolsheviki toward the Constituent Assembly changed as\r\ntheir electoral prospects changed. At first, believing that, as a result of\r\ntheir successful _coup_, they would have the support of the great mass of\r\nthe peasants and city workers, they were vigorous in their support of the\r\nAssembly. In the first of their \"decrees\" after the overthrow of the\r\nKerensky Cabinet, the Bolshevik \"Commissaries of the People\" announced that\r\nthey were to exercise complete power \"until the meeting of the Constituent\r\nAssembly,\" which was nothing less than a pledge that they would regard the\r\nlatter body as the supreme, ultimate authority. Three days after the revolt\r\nLenine, as president of the People's Commissaries, published this decree:\r\n\r\n    In the name of the Government of the Republic, elected by the\r\n    All-Russian Congress of Councils of Workmen's and Soldiers'\r\n    Delegates, with the participation of the Peasants' Delegates, the\r\n    Council of the People's Commissaries decrees:\r\n\r\n    1. That the elections to the Constituent Assembly shall be held on\r\n    November 25th, the day set aside for this purpose.\r\n\r\n    2. All electoral committees, all local organizations, the Councils\r\n    of Workmen's, Soldiers' and Peasants' Delegates and the soldiers'\r\n    organizations at the front are to bend every effort toward\r\n    safeguarding the freedom of the voters and fair play at the\r\n    elections to the Constituent Assembly, which will be held on the\r\n    appointed date.\r\n\r\nIf this attitude had been maintained throughout, and had the Bolsheviki\r\nloyally accepted the verdict of the electorate when it was given, there\r\ncould have been no complaint. But the evidence shows that their early\r\nattitude was not maintained. Later on, as reports received from the\r\ninterior of the country showed that the masses were not flocking to their\r\nbanners, they began to assume a critical attitude toward the Constituent\r\nAssembly. The leaders of the Socialist-Revolutionary party were warning\r\ntheir followers that the Bolsheviki would try to wreck the Constituent\r\nAssembly, for which they were bitterly denounced in organs like _Pravda_\r\nand _Izvestya_. Very soon, however, these Bolshevist organs began to\r\ndiscuss the Constituent Assembly in a very critical spirit. It was\r\npossible, they pointed out, that it would have a bourgeois majority,\r\ntreating the Socialist-Revolutionists and the Cadets as being on the same\r\nlevel, equally servants of the bourgeoisie. Then appeared editorials to\r\nshow that it would not be possible to place the destinies of Russia in the\r\nhands of such people, even though they were elected by the \"unthinking\r\nmasses.\" Finally, when it was clear that the Socialist-Revolutionary party\r\nhad elected a majority of the members, _Pravda_ and _Izvestya_ took the\r\nposition that _the victorious people did not need a Constituent Assembly_;\r\nthat a new instrument had been created which made the old democratic method\r\nobsolete.[35] The \"new instrument\" was, of course, the Bolshevist Soviet.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nFor the moment we are not concerned with the merits or the failings of the\r\nSoviet considered as an instrument of government. We are concerned only\r\nwith democracy and the relation of the Bolshevist method to democracy. From\r\nthis point of view, then, let us consider the facts. The Soviet was not\r\nsomething new, as so many of our American drawing-room champions of\r\nBolshevism seem to think. The Soviet was the type of organization common to\r\nRussia. There were Soviets of peasants, of soldiers, of teachers, of\r\nindustrial workers, of officers, of professional men, and so on. Every\r\nclass and every group in the classes had its own Soviet. The Soviet in its\r\nsimplest form is a delegate body consisting of representatives of a\r\nparticular group--a peasants' Soviet, for example. Another type, more\r\nimportant, roughly corresponds to the Central Labor Union in an American\r\ncity, in that it is composed of representatives of workers of all kinds.\r\nThese delegates are, in the main, chosen by the workers in the shops and\r\nfactories and in the meetings of the unions. The anti-Bolshevist\r\nSocialists, such as the Mensheviki and the Socialist-Revolutionists, were\r\nnot opposed to Soviets as working-class organizations. On the contrary,\r\nthey approved of them, supported them, and, generally, belonged to them.\r\n\r\nThey were opposed only to the theory that these Soviets, recruited in a\r\nmore or less haphazard manner, as such organizations must necessarily be,\r\nwere better adapted to the governing of a great country like Russia than a\r\nlegal body which received its mandate in elections based upon universal,\r\nequal, direct, and secret suffrage. No one ever pretended that the Soviets\r\nrepresented all the workers of Russia--including peasants in that term--or\r\neven a majority of them. No one ever pretended that the Soviet, as such,\r\nwas a stable and constant factor. New Soviets were always springing up and\r\nothers dying out. Many existed only in name, on paper. _There never has\r\nbeen an accurate list of the Soviets existing in Russia_. Many lists have\r\nbeen made, but always by the time they could be tabulated and published\r\nthere have been many changes. For these and other reasons which will\r\nsuggest themselves to the mind of any thoughtful reader, many of the\r\nleaders of the revolutionary movement in Russia have doubted the value of\r\nthe Soviet as a _unit of government, while highly valuing it as a unit of\r\nworking-class organization and struggle_.\r\n\r\nBack of all the strife between the Bolsheviki centered around the Soviets\r\nand the Socialist-Revolutionists and Mensheviki, centered around the\r\nConstituent Assembly, was a greater fact than any we have been discussing,\r\nhowever. The Bolsheviki with their doctrinaire Marxism had carried the\r\ndoctrine of the class struggle to such extreme lengths that they virtually\r\nplaced the great mass of the peasants with the bourgeoisie. The Revolution\r\nmust be controlled by the proletariat, they argued. The control of the\r\ngovernment and of industry by the people, which was the slogan of the old\r\ndemocracy, will not do, for the term \"the people\" includes bourgeois\r\nelements. Even if it is narrowed by excluding the great capitalists and\r\nlandowners, still it embraces the lesser capitalists, small landowners,\r\nshopkeepers, and the petty bourgeoisie in general. These elements weaken\r\nthe militancy of the proletariat. What is needed is the dictatorship of the\r\nproletariat. Now, only a very small part of the peasantry, the very poor\r\npeasants, can be safely linked to the proletariat--and even these must be\r\ncarefully watched. It was a phase of the old and familiar conflict between\r\nagrarian and industrial groups in the Socialist movement. It is not very\r\nmany years since the Socialist party of America was convulsed by a similar\r\ndiscussion. Could the farmer ever be a genuine and sincere and trustworthy\r\nSocialist? The question was asked in the party papers in all seriousness,\r\nand in one or two state organizations measures were taken to limit the\r\nnumber of farmers entering the party, so that at all times there might be\r\nthe certainty of a preponderance of proletarian over farmer votes.\r\n\r\nSimilar distrust, only upon a much bigger scale, explains the fight for and\r\nagainst the Constituent Assembly. Lenine and his followers distrusted the\r\npeasants as a class whose interests were akin to the class of small\r\nproperty-owners. He would only unite with the poor, propertyless peasants.\r\nThe leaders of the peasantry, on the other hand, supported by the more\r\nliberal Marxians, would expand the meaning of the term \"working class\" and\r\nembrace within its meaning all the peasants as well as all city workers,\r\nmost of the professional classes, and so on. We can get some idea of this\r\nstrife from a criticism which Lenine directs against the Mensheviki:\r\n\r\n    In its class composition this party is not Socialist at all. It\r\n    does not represent the toiling masses. It represents fairly\r\n    prosperous peasants and working-men, petty traders, many small and\r\n    some even fairly large capitalists, and a certain number of real\r\n    but gullible proletarians who have been caught in the bourgeois\r\n    net.[36]\r\n\r\nIt is clear from this criticism that Lenine does not believe that a genuine\r\nSocialist party--and, presumably, therefore, the same must apply to a\r\nSocialist government--can represent \"fairly prosperous peasants and\r\nworking-men.\" We now know how to appraise the Soviet government. The\r\nconstitution of Russia under the rule of the Bolsheviki is required by law\r\nto be posted in all public places in Russia. In Article II, Chapter V,\r\nparagraph 9, of this document it is set forth that \"the Constitution of the\r\nRussian Socialist Federated Soviet Republic involves, in view of the\r\npresent transition period, the establishment of a dictatorship of the urban\r\nand rural proletariat and the poorest peasantry in the form of a powerful\r\nAll-Russian Soviet authority.\" Attention is called to this passage here,\r\nnot for the sake of pointing out the obvious need for some exact definition\r\nof the loose expression, \"the poorest peasantry,\" nor for the sake of any\r\ncaptious criticism, but solely to point out the important fact that Lenine\r\nonly admits a part of the peasantry--the poorest--to share in the\r\ndictatorship of the proletariat.\r\n\r\nTurning to another part of the same important document--Article III,\r\nChapter VI, Section A, paragraph 25--we find the basis of representation in\r\nthe All-Russian Congress of Soviets stated. There are representatives of\r\ntown Soviets and representatives of provincial congresses of Soviets. The\r\nformer represent the industrial workers; the latter represent the peasants\r\nalmost exclusively. It is important, therefore, to note that there is one\r\ndelegate for every twenty-five thousand city voters and one for every one\r\nhundred and twenty-five thousand peasant voters! In Section B of the same\r\nArticle, Chapter X, paragraph 53, we find the same discrimination: it takes\r\nfive peasants' votes to equal the vote of one city voter; it was this\r\ngeneral attitude of the Bolsheviki toward the peasants, dividing them into\r\nclasses and treating the great majority of them as petty, rural\r\nbourgeoisie, which roused the resentment of the peasants' leaders. They\r\nnaturally insisted that the peasants constituted a distinct class,\r\nco-operating with the proletariat, not to be ruled by it. Even Marie\r\nSpiridonova, who at first joined with the Bolsheviki, was compelled, later\r\non, to assert this point of view.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand the distrust of the Bolsheviki by the Socialist\r\nparties and groups which represented the peasants. The latter class\r\nconstituted more than 85 per cent. of the population. Moreover, it had\r\nfurnished the great majority of the fighters in the revolutionary movement.\r\nIts leaders and spokesmen resented the idea that they were to be dictated\r\nto and controlled by a minority, which was, as Lenine himself admitted, not\r\nmaterially more numerous than the old ruling class of landowners had been.\r\nThey wanted a democratic governmental system, free from class rule, while\r\nthe Bolsheviki wanted class rule. Generalizations are proverbially\r\nperilous, and should be very cautiously made and applied to great currents\r\nof thought and of life. But in a broad sense we may fairly say that the\r\nSocialism of the Socialist-Revolutionists and the Mensheviki, the Socialism\r\nof Kerensky and the men who were the majority of the Constituent Assembly,\r\nwas the product of Russian life and Russian economic development, while the\r\nSocialism that the Bolsheviki tried by force of arms to impose upon Russia\r\nwas as un-Russian as it could be. The Bolshevist conception of Socialism\r\nhad its origin in Marxian theory. Both Marx and Engels freely predicted the\r\nsetting up of \"a dictatorship of the proletariat\"--the phrase which the\r\nBolsheviki have made their own.\r\n\r\nYet, the Bolsheviki are not Marxians. Their Socialism is as little Marxian\r\nas Russian. When Marx and Engels forecasted the establishment of\r\nproletarian dictatorship it was part of their theorem that economic\r\nevolution would have reduced practically all the masses to a proletarian\r\nstate; that industrial and commercial concentration would have reached such\r\na stage of development that there would be on the one side a small class\r\nof owners, and, on the other side, the proletariat. There would be, they\r\nbelieved, no middle class. The disappearance of the middle class was, for\r\nthem and for their followers, a development absolutely certain to take\r\nplace. They saw the same process going on with the same result in\r\nagriculture. It might be less rapid in its progress, but not one whit less\r\ncertain. It was only as the inevitable climax to this evolution that they\r\nbelieved the \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" would be achieved. In other\r\nwords, the proletariat would be composed of the overwhelming majority of\r\nthe body politic and social. That is very different from the Bolshevist\r\nattempt to set up the dictatorship of the proletariat in a land where more\r\nthan 85 per cent, of the people are peasants; where industrial development\r\nis behind the rest of the world, and where dictatorship of the proletariat\r\nmeans the domination of more than one hundred and eighty millions of people\r\nby two hundred thousand \"proletarians and the poorest peasants,\" according\r\nto Lenine's statement, or by six per cent. of the population _if we assume\r\nthe entire proletariat to be united in the dictatorship!_\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nAt the time of the disturbances which took place in Petrograd in December,\r\nover the delay in holding the Constituent Assembly, the Bolshevik\r\ngovernment announced that the Constituante would be permitted to convene on\r\nJanuary 18th, provided that not less than four hundred delegates were in\r\nattendance. Accordingly, the defenders of the Constituent Assembly arranged\r\nfor a great demonstration to take place on that day in honor of the event.\r\nIt was also intended to be a warning to the Bolsheviki not to try to\r\nfurther interfere with the Constituante. An earnest but entirely peaceful\r\nmass of people paraded with flags and banners and signs containing such\r\ninscriptions as \"Proletarians of All Countries, Unite!\" \"Land and Liberty,\"\r\n\"Long Live the Constituent Assembly,\" and many others. They set out from\r\ndifferent parts of the city to unite at the Field of Mars and march to the\r\nTaurida Palace to protest against any interference with the Constituent\r\nAssembly. As they neared the Taurida Palace they were confronted by Red\r\nGuards, who, without any preliminary warning or any effort at persuasion,\r\nfired into the crowd. Among the first victims was a member of the Executive\r\nCommittee of the Soviet of Peasants' Delegates, the Siberian peasant\r\nLogvinov, part of whose head was shot away by an explosive bullet. Another\r\nvictim was the militant Socialist-Revolutionist Gorbatchevskaia. Several\r\nstudents and a number of workmen were also killed. Similar massacres\r\noccurred at the same time in other parts of the city. Other processions\r\nwending their way toward the meeting-place were fired into. Altogether one\r\nhundred persons were either killed or very seriously wounded by the Red\r\nGuards, who said that they had received orders \"not to spare the\r\ncartridges.\" Similar demonstrations were held in Moscow and other cities\r\nand were similarly treated by the Red Guards. In Moscow especially the loss\r\nof life was great. Yet the Bolshevist organs passed these tragic events\r\nover in complete silence. They did not mention the massacres, nor did they\r\nmention the great demonstration at the funeral of the victims, four days\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nWhen the Constituent Assembly was formally opened, on January 18th, it was\r\nwell known on every hand that the Bolshevik government would use force to\r\ndestroy it if the deputies refused to do exactly as they were told. The\r\ncorridors were filled with armed soldiers and sailors, ready for action.\r\n\r\nThe Lenine-Trotzky Ministry had summoned an extraordinary Congress of\r\nSoviets to meet in Petrograd at the same time, and it was well understood\r\nthat they were determined to erect this Soviet Congress into the supreme\r\nlegislative power. If the Constituent Assembly would consent to this, so\r\nmuch the better, of course. In that case there would be a valuable legal\r\nsanction, the sanction of a democratically elected body expressly charged\r\nwith the task of determining the form and manner of government for Free\r\nRussia. Should the Constituent Assembly not be willing, there was an\r\nopportunity for another _coup d'état_.\r\n\r\nIn precisely the same way as the Ministry during the last years of Czarism\r\nwould lay before the Duma certain documents and demand that they be\r\napproved, so the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets--the Bolshevik\r\npower--demanded that the Constituent Assembly meekly assent to a document\r\nprepared for it in advance. It was at once a test and a challenge; if the\r\nAssembly was willing to accept orders from the Soviet authority and content\r\nitself with rubber-stamping the decrees of the latter, as ordered, it could\r\nbe permitted to go on--at least for a time. At the head of the Constituent\r\nAssembly, as president, the deputies elected Victor Chernov, who had been\r\nMinister of Agriculture under Kerensky. At the head of the Bolshevik\r\nfaction was Sverdlov, chairman of the Executive Committee of the Soviets.\r\nHe it was who opened the fight, demanding that the following declaration be\r\nadopted by the Constituante as the basis of a Constitution for Russia:\r\n\r\n    DECLARATION OF THE RIGHT'S OF THE TOILING AND EXPLOITED\r\n    PEOPLE\r\n\r\n    I\r\n\r\n    1. Russia is to be declared a republic of the workers', soldiers'\r\n    and peasants' Soviets. All power in the cities and in the country\r\n    belongs to the Soviets.\r\n\r\n    2. The Russian Soviet Republic is based on the free federation of\r\n    free peoples, on the federation of national Soviet republics.\r\n\r\n    II\r\n\r\n    Assuming as its duty the destruction of all exploitation of the\r\n    workers, the complete abolition of the class system of society,\r\n    and the placing of society upon a socialistic basis, and the\r\n    ultimate bringing about of victory for Socialism in every country,\r\n    the Constituent Assembly further decides:\r\n\r\n    1. That the socialization of land be realized, private ownership\r\n    of land be abolished, all the land be proclaimed common property\r\n    of the people and turned over to the toiling masses without\r\n    compensation on the basis of equal right to the use of land.\r\n\r\n    All forests, mines, and waters which are of social importance, as\r\n    well as all living and other forms of property, and all\r\n    agricultural enterprises, are declared national property.\r\n\r\n    2. To confirm the decree of the Soviets concerning the inspection\r\n    of working conditions, the highest department of national economy,\r\n    which is the first step in achieving the ownership by the Soviets\r\n    of the factories, mines, railroads, and means of production and\r\n    transportation.\r\n\r\n    3. To confirm the decree of the Soviets transferring all banks to\r\n    the ownership of the Soviet Republic, as one of the steps in the\r\n    freeing of the toiling masses from the yoke of capitalism.\r\n\r\n    4. To enforce general compulsory labor, in order to destroy the\r\n    class of parasites, and to reorganize the economic life. In order\r\n    to make the power of the toiling masses secure and to prevent the\r\n    restoration of the rule of the exploiters, the toiling masses will\r\n    be armed and a Red Guard composed of workers and peasants formed,\r\n    and the exploiting classes shall be disarmed.\r\n\r\n    III\r\n\r\n    1. Declaring its firm determination to make society free from the\r\n    chaos of capitalism and imperialism, which has drenched the\r\n    country in blood in this most criminal war of all wars, the\r\n    Constituent Assembly accepts completely the policy of the Soviets,\r\n    whose duty it is to publish all secret treaties, to organize the\r\n    most extensive fraternization between the workers and peasants of\r\n    warring armies, and by revolutionary methods to bring about a\r\n    democratic peace among the belligerent nations without annexations\r\n    and indemnities, on the basis of the free self-determination of\r\n    nations--at any price.\r\n\r\n    2. For this purpose the Constituent Assembly declares its complete\r\n    separation from the brutal policy of the bourgeoisie, which\r\n    furthers the well-being of the exploiters in a few selected\r\n    nations by enslaving hundreds of millions of the toiling peoples\r\n    of the colonies and the small nations generally.\r\n\r\n    The Constituent Assembly accepts the policy of the Council of\r\n    People's Commissars in giving complete independence to Finland, in\r\n    beginning the withdrawal of troops from Persia, and in declaring\r\n    for Armenia the right of self-determination.\r\n\r\n    A blow at international financial capital is the Soviet decree\r\n    which annuls foreign loans made by the governments of the Czar,\r\n    the landowners and the bourgeoisie. The Soviet government is to\r\n    continue firmly on this road until the final victory from the yoke\r\n    of capitalism is won through international workers' revolt.\r\n\r\n    As the Constituent Assembly was elected on the basis of lists of\r\n    candidates nominated before the November Revolution, when the\r\n    people as a whole could not yet rise against their exploiters, and\r\n    did not know how powerful would be the strength of the exploiters\r\n    in defending their privileges, and had not yet begun to create a\r\n    Socialist society, the Constituent Assembly considers it, even\r\n    from a formal point of view, unjust to oppose the Soviet power.\r\n    The Constituent Assembly is of the opinion that at this moment, in\r\n    the decisive hour of the struggle of the people against their\r\n    exploiters, the exploiters must not have a seat in any government\r\n    organization or institution. The power completely and without\r\n    exception belongs to the people and its authorized\r\n    representatives--the workers', soldiers' and peasants' Soviets.\r\n\r\n    Supporting the Soviet rule and accepting the orders of the Council\r\n    of People's Commissars, the Constituent Assembly acknowledges its\r\n    duty to outline a form for the reorganization of society.\r\n\r\n    Striving at the same time to organize a free and voluntary, and\r\n    thereby also a complete and strong, union among the toiling\r\n    classes of all the Russian nations, the Constituent Assembly\r\n    limits itself to outlining the basis of the federation of Russian\r\n    Soviet Republics, leaving to the people, to the workers and\r\n    soldiers, to decide for themselves, in their own Soviet meetings,\r\n    if they are willing, and on what conditions they prefer, to join\r\n    the federated government and other federations of Soviet\r\n    enterprise. These general principles are to be published without\r\n    delay, and the official representatives of the Soviets are\r\n    required to read them at the opening of the Constituent Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe demand for the adoption of this declaration gave rise to a long and\r\nstormy debate. The leaders of the Socialist-Revolutionists and the\r\nMensheviki stoutly contended that the adoption of the declaration would be\r\nvirtually an abdication of the task for which the Constituent Assembly had\r\nbeen elected by the people, and, therefore, a betrayal of trust. They could\r\nnot admit the impudent claim that an election held in November, based upon\r\nuniversal suffrage, on lists made up as recently as September, could in\r\nJanuary be set aside as being \"obsolete\" and \"unrepresentative.\" That a\r\nmajority of the Bolshevik candidates put forward had been defeated,\r\nnullified, they argued, the claim of the Bolsheviki that the fact that the\r\ncandidates had all been nominated before the November insurrection should\r\nbe regarded as reason for acknowledging the Bolshevik Soviet as superior to\r\nthe Constituent Assembly. They insisted upon the point, which the Bolshevik\r\nspokesmen did not attempt to controvert, that the Constituent Assembly\r\nrepresented the votes of many millions of men and women,[37] while the\r\ntotal actual membership represented by the Soviet power did not at the time\r\nnumber one hundred thousand!\r\n\r\nAs might have been expected, the proposal to adopt the declaration\r\nsubmitted to the Constituent Assembly in this arrogant fashion was rejected\r\nby an enormous majority. The Bolshevik members, who had tried to make the\r\nsession a farce, thereupon withdrew after submitting a statement in which\r\nthey charged the Constituent Assembly with being a counter-revolutionary\r\nbody, and the Revolutionary-Socialist party with being a traitorous party\r\n\"directing the fight of the bourgeoisie against the workers' revolution.\"\r\nThe statement said that the Bolshevik members withdrew \"in order to permit\r\nthe Soviet power to determine what relations it would hold with the\r\ncounter-revolutionary section of the Constituent Assembly\"--a threat which\r\nneeded no interpretation.\r\n\r\nAfter the withdrawal of the Bolshevik members, the majority very quickly\r\nadopted a declaration which had been carefully prepared by the\r\nSocialist-Revolutionists during the weeks which had elapsed since the\r\nelections in the preliminary conferences which had been held for that\r\npurpose. The declaration read as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    RUSSIA'S FORM OF GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n    In the name of the peoples who compose the Russian state, the\r\n    All-Russian Constituent Assembly proclaims the Russian State to be\r\n    the Russian Democratic Federated Republic, uniting indissolubly\r\n    into one whole the peoples and territories which are sovereign\r\n    within the limits prescribed by the Federal Constitution.\r\n\r\n    LAWS REGARDING LAND OWNERSHIP\r\n\r\n    1. _The right to privately own land within the boundaries of the\r\n    Russian Republic is hereby abolished forever._\r\n\r\n    2. All land within the boundaries of the Russian Republic, with\r\n    all mines, forests, and waters, is hereby declared the property of\r\n    the nation.\r\n\r\n    3. The republic has the right to control all land, with all the\r\n    mines, forests, and waters thereof, through the central and local\r\n    administration, in accordance with the regulation provided by the\r\n    present law.\r\n\r\n    4. The autonomous provinces of the Russian Republic have title to\r\n    land on the basis of the present law and in accordance with the\r\n    Federal Constitution.\r\n\r\n    5. The tasks of the central and local governments as regards the\r\n    use of lands, mines, forests, and waters are:\r\n\r\n    a. The creation of conditions conducive to the best possible\r\n    utilization of the country's natural resources and the highest\r\n    possible development of its productive forces.\r\n\r\n    b. The fair distribution of all natural wealth among the people.\r\n\r\n    6. The rights of individuals and institutions to land, mines,\r\n    forests, and waters are restricted merely to utilization by said\r\n    individuals and institutions.\r\n\r\n    7. The use of all mines, forests, land, and waters is free to all\r\n    citizens of the Russian Republic, regardless of nationality or\r\n    creed. This includes all unions of citizens, also governmental and\r\n    public institutions.\r\n\r\n    8. The right to use the land is to be acquired and discontinued on\r\n    the basis prescribed by this fundamental law.\r\n\r\n    9. _All titles to land at present held by the individuals,\r\n    associations, and institutions are abolished in so far as they\r\n    contradict this law._\r\n\r\n    10. All land, mines, forests, waters, at present owned by and\r\n    otherwise in the possession of individuals, associations, and\r\n    institutions, _are confiscated without compensation for the loss\r\n    incurred._\r\n\r\n    DEMOCRATIC PEACE\r\n\r\n    In the name of the peoples of the Russian Republic, the\r\n    All-Russian Constituent Assembly expresses the firm will of the\r\n    people to _immediately discontinue the war_ and conclude a just\r\n    and general peace, appeals to the Allied countries proposing to\r\n    define jointly the exact terms of the democratic peace acceptable\r\n    to all the belligerent nations, in order to present these terms,\r\n    in behalf of the Allies, to the governments fighting against the\r\n    Russian Republic and her allies.\r\n\r\n    The Constituent Assembly firmly believes that the attempts of the\r\n    peoples of Russia to end the disastrous war will meet with a\r\n    unanimous response on the part of the peoples and the governments\r\n    of the Allied countries, and that by common efforts a speedy peace\r\n    will be attained, which will safeguard the well-being and dignity\r\n    of all the belligerent countries.\r\n\r\n    The Constituent Assembly resolves to elect from its midst an\r\n    authorized delegation which will carry on negotiations with the\r\n    representatives of the Allied countries and which will present the\r\n    appeal to jointly formulate terms upon which a speedy termination\r\n    of the war will be possible, as well as for the purpose of\r\n    carrying out the decisions of the Constituent Assembly regarding\r\n    the question of peace negotiations with the countries fighting\r\n    against us.\r\n\r\n    This delegation, which is to be under the guidance of the\r\n    Constituent Assembly, is to immediately start fulfilling the\r\n    duties imposed upon it.\r\n\r\n    Expressing, in the name of the peoples of Russia, its regret that\r\n    the negotiations with Germany, which were started without\r\n    preliminary agreement with the Allied countries, have assumed the\r\n    character of negotiations for a separate peace, the Constituent\r\n    Assembly, in the name of the peoples of the Federated Republic,\r\n    _while continuing the armistice, accepts the further carrying on\r\n    of the negotiations with the countries warring against us_ in\r\n    order to work toward a general democratic peace which shall be in\r\n    accordance \"with the people's will and protect Russia's\r\n    interests.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nImmediately following the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly a body of\r\nRed Guards shot the two Constitutional Democrats, Kokoshkin and Shingariev,\r\nwho were at the time confined as prisoners who were ill in the Naval\r\nHospital. The reason for the brutal murder of these men was that they were\r\nbourgeoisie and, therefore, enemies of the working class! It is only just\r\nto add that the foul deed was immediately condemned by the Bolshevik\r\ngovernment and by the Soviet of Petrograd. \"The working class will never\r\napprove of any outrages upon our prisoners, whatever may have been their\r\npolitical offense against the people and their Revolution,\" the latter body\r\ndeclared, in a resolution on the subject of the assassinations. Two days\r\nafter the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly twenty-three\r\nSocialist-Revolutionist members of that body, assembled at the office of\r\ntheir party, were arrested, and the premises occupied by Red Guards, the\r\nprocedure being exactly as it used to be in the old days under the Czar.\r\n\r\nThere is a relentless logic of life and action from which there can be no\r\nescape. Czarism was a product of that inexorable process. All its\r\noppression and brutality proceeded by an inevitable and irresistible\r\nsequence from the first determination and effort to realize the principle\r\nof autocracy. Any dictatorship, whether of a single man, a group or class,\r\nmust rest ultimately upon oppressive and coercive force. Believing that the\r\nmeans would be justified by the end, Lenine and Trotzky and their\r\nassociates had suppressed the Constituent Assembly, claiming that\r\nparliamentary government, based upon the equal and free suffrage of all\r\nclasses, was, during the transition period, dangerous to the proletariat;\r\nthat in its stead a new type of government must be established--government\r\nby associations of wage-earners, soldiers, and peasants, called Soviets.\r\n\r\nBut what if among these there should develop a purpose contrary to the\r\npurpose of the Bolsheviki? Would men who, starting out with a belief in the\r\nConstituante, and as its champions, used force to destroy and suppress it\r\nthe moment it became evident that its purpose was not their purpose,\r\nhesitate to suppress and destroy any Soviet movement which adopted\r\npolicies contrary to their own? What assurance could there be, once their\r\npoint of view, their initial principle, was granted, that the freedom\r\ndenied to the Constituante would be assured to the Soviets? In the very\r\nnature of the case there could be no such assurance. However honest and\r\nsincere the Bolsheviki themselves might be in their belief that there would\r\nbe such assurance, there could in fact be none, for the logic of life is\r\nstronger than any human will.\r\n\r\nAs was inevitable, the Bolsheviki soon found themselves in the position of\r\nsuppressing Soviets which they could not control as freely and in the same\r\nmanner as they had suppressed the Constituent Assembly. When, for example,\r\nthe soldiers of the Preobrajenski Regiment--the very men who helped the\r\nBolsheviki into power--became dissatisfied and organized, publishing their\r\nown organ, _The Soldier's Cloak_, the paper was confiscated and the\r\norganization suppressed.[38] The forcible suppression of Soviets was\r\ncommon. The Central Executive Committee of the National Soviet of Peasants'\r\nDelegates, together with the old Central Executive Committee of the Soviets\r\nof Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates (who had never acknowledged the\r\nOctober elections), convoked an extraordinary assembly of Soviets on\r\nJanuary 8th, the same date as that on which the Bolshevik Congress of\r\nSoviets was convoked. Circumstances compelled the opening to be deferred\r\nuntil two days later, the 10th. This conference, called the Third\r\nAll-Russian Congress of Peasants' Soviets, was suppressed by force, many of\r\nthe 359 delegates and all the members of the Executive Committee being\r\narrested. The following extract from a declaration of protest addressed by\r\nthe outraged peasants to the Congress of Soviets of Workmen, Soldiers, and\r\nPeasants convoked by the Bolshevik government tells the story:\r\n\r\n    As soon as the Congress was opened, sailors and Red Guards, armed\r\n    with guns and hand-grenades, broke into the premises (11\r\n    Kirillovskaia Street), surrounded the house, poured into the\r\n    corridors and the session hall, and ordered all persons to leave.\r\n\r\n    \"In whose name do you order us, who are Delegates to the Peasants'\r\n    Congress of All-Russia, to disperse?\" asked the peasants.\r\n\r\n    \"In the name of the Baltic fleet,\" the sailor's replied.\r\n\r\n    The peasants refused; cries of protest were raised. One by one the\r\n    peasants ascended the tribune to stigmatize the Bolsheviki in\r\n    speeches full of indignation, and to express the hopes that they\r\n    placed in the Constituent Assembly....\r\n\r\n    This session of the Congress presented a strange spectacle:\r\n    disturbed by men who confessed that they did not know why they\r\n    were there, the peasants sang revolutionary songs; the sailors,\r\n    armed with guns and grenades, joined them. Then the peasants knelt\r\n    down to sing a funeral hymn to the memory of Logvinov, whose\r\n    coffin was even yesterday within the room. The soldiers, lowering\r\n    their guns, knelt down also.\r\n\r\n    The Bolshevik authorities became excited; they did not expect such\r\n    a turn of events. \"Enough said,\" declared the chiefs; \"we have\r\n    come not to speak, but to act. If they do not want to go to\r\n    Smolny, let them get out of here.\" And they set themselves to the\r\n    task.\r\n\r\n    In groups of five the peasants were conducted down-stairs,\r\n    trampled upon, and, on their refusal to go to Smolny, pushed out\r\n    of doors during the night in the midst of the enormous city of\r\n    which they knew nothing.\r\n\r\n    Members of the Executive Committee were arrested,[39] the premises\r\n    occupied by sailors and Red Guards, the objects found therein\r\n    stolen.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The peasants found shelter in the homes of the inhabitants of\r\n    Petrograd, who, indignant, offered them hospitality. A certain\r\n    number were lodged in the barracks of the Preobrajenski Regiment.\r\n    The sailors, who but a few minutes before had sung a funeral hymn\r\n    to Logvinov, and wept when they saw that they had understood\r\n    nothing, now became the docile executioners of the orders of the\r\n    Bolsheviki. And when they were asked, \"Why do you do this?\" they\r\n    answered, as in the time, still recent, of Czarism: \"It is the\r\n    order. No need to talk.\"[40]\r\n\r\nWe do not need to rely upon the testimony of witnesses belonging to the\r\nRevolutionary Socialist party, the Mensheviki, or other factions unfriendly\r\nto the Bolsheviki. However trustworthy such testimony may be, and however\r\nwell corroborated, we cannot expect it to be convincing to those who pin\r\ntheir faith to the Bolsheviki. Such people will believe only what the\r\nBolsheviki themselves say about Bolshevism. It is well, therefore, that we\r\ncan supplement the testimony already given by equally definite and direct\r\ntestimony from official Bolshevist sources to the same effect. From the\r\nofficial organs of the Bolsheviki it can be shown that the Bolshevik\r\nauthorities suppressed Soviet after Soviet; that when they found that\r\nSoviets were controlled by Socialists who belonged to other factions they\r\ndissolved them and ordered new elections, refusing to permit the free\r\nchoice of the members to be expressed in selecting their officers.\r\n\r\nThe Bolsheviki did this, it should be remembered, not merely in cases where\r\nMensheviki or Socialist-Revolutionists were in the majority, but\r\nalso in cases where the majority consisted of members of the\r\nSocialist-Revolutionary party of the Left--the faction which had united\r\nwith the Bolsheviki in suppressing the Constituante. Their union with the\r\nBolsheviki was from the first a compromise, based upon the political\r\nopportunism of both sides. The Socialist-Revolutionists of the Left did not\r\nbelieve in the Bolshevik theories or program, but they wanted the political\r\nassistance of the Bolsheviki. The latter did not believe in the theories or\r\nprogram of the Socialist-Revolutionists of the Left, but they wanted their\r\npolitical support. The union could not long endure; the differences were\r\ntoo deeply rooted. Before very long the Bolsheviki were fighting their\r\nformer allies and the Socialist-Revolutionists of the Left, like Marie\r\nSpiridonova, for example, were fighting the Bolsheviki. At Kazan, where\r\nLenine went to school, the Soviet was dissolved because it was controlled\r\nby Socialist-Revolutionists of the Left, former allies, now hostile to the\r\nBolsheviki. Here are two paragraphs from _Izvestya_, one of the Bolshevist\r\nofficial organs:\r\n\r\n    KAZAN, _July 26th. As the important offices in the Soviet\r\n    were occupied by Socialist-Revolutionists of the Left, the\r\n    Extraordinary Commission has dissolved the Provisional Soviet. The\r\n    governmental power is now represented by a Revolutionary\r\n    Committee. (Izvestya, July 28, 1918.)_\r\n\r\n    KAZAN, _August 1_. The state of mind of the workmen is\r\n    revolutionary. _If the Mensheviki dare to carry on their\r\n    propaganda, death menaces them. (Idem, August 3.)_\r\n\r\nAnd here is confirmation from another official organ of the Bolsheviki,\r\n_Pravda_:\r\n\r\n    KAZAN, _August 4th_. The Provisional Congress of the\r\n    Soviets of the Peasants has been dissolved because of the absence\r\n    from it of poor peasants and _because its state of mind is\r\n    obviously counter-revolutionary. (Pravda, August 6, 1918.)_\r\n\r\nAs early as April, 1918, the Soviet at Jaroslav was dissolved by the\r\nBolshevik authorities and new elections ordered.[41] In these elections\r\nthe Mensheviki and the Socialist-Revolutionists everywhere gained an\r\nabsolute majority.[42] The population here wanted the Constituent Assembly\r\nand they wanted Russia to fight on with the Allies. Attempts to suppress\r\nthis majority led to insurrection, which the Bolsheviki crushed in the most\r\nbrutal manner, and when the people, overpowered and helpless, sought to\r\nmake peace, the Bolsheviki only _increased the artillery fire_! Here is an\r\n\"Official Bulletin,\" published in _Izvestya_, July 21, 1918:\r\n\r\n    At Jaroslav the adversary, gripped in the iron ring of our troops,\r\n    has tried to enter into negotiations. _The reply has been given\r\n    under the form of redoubled artillery fire._\r\n\r\n_Izvestya_ published, on July 25th, a Bolshevist military proclamation\r\naddressed to the inhabitants of Jaroslav concerning the insurrection which\r\noriginally arose from the suppression of the Soviet and other popular\r\nassemblages:\r\n\r\n    The General Staff notifies to the population of Jaroslav that all\r\n    those who desire to live are invited to abandon the town in the\r\n    course of twenty-four hours and to meet near the America Bridge.\r\n    Those who remain will be treated as insurgents, _and no quarter\r\n    will be given to any one_. Heavy artillery fire and gas-bombs will\r\n    be used against them. _All those who remain will perish In the\r\n    ruins of the town with the insurrectionists, the traitors, and the\r\n    enemies of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolution._\r\n\r\nNext day, July 26th, _Izvestya_ published the information that \"after\r\nminute questionings and full inquiry\" a special commission appointed to\r\ninquire into the events relating to the insurrection at Jaroslav had listed\r\n350 persons as having \"taken an active part in the insurrection and had\r\nrelations with the Czecho-Slovaks,\" and that by order of the commissioners\r\nthe whole band of 350 had been shot!\r\n\r\nIt is needless to multiply the illustrations of brutal oppression--of men\r\nand women arrested and imprisoned for no other crime than that of engaging\r\nin propaganda in favor of government by universal suffrage; of newspapers\r\nconfiscated and suppressed; of meetings banned and Soviets dissolved\r\nbecause the members' \"state of mind\" did not please the Bolsheviki. Maxim\r\nGorky declared in his _Novya Zhizn_ that there had been \"ten thousand\r\nlynchings.\" Upon what authority Gorky--who was inclined to sympathize with\r\nthe Bolsheviki, and who even accepted office under them--based that\r\nstatement is not known. Probably it is an exaggeration. One thing, however,\r\nis quite certain, namely, that a reign of terror surpassing the worst days\r\nof the old régime was inflicted upon unhappy Russia by the Bolsheviki. At\r\nthe very beginning of the Bolshevik régime Trotzky laughed to scorn all the\r\nprotests against violence, threatening that resort would be had to the\r\nguillotine. Speaking to the opponents of the Bolshevik policy in the\r\nPetrograd Soviet, he said:\r\n\r\n\"You are perturbed by the mild terror we are applying against our class\r\nenemies, but know that not later than a month hence this terror will take a\r\nmore terrible form on the model of the terror of the great revolutionaries\r\nof France. Not a fortress, but the guillotine will be for our enemies.\"\r\n\r\nThat threat was not literally carried out, but there was a near approach to\r\nit when public hangings for civil offenses were established. For\r\nreintroducing the death penalty into the army as a means of putting an end\r\nto treason and the brutal murder of officers by rebellious soldiers, the\r\nBolsheviki excoriated Kerensky. _Yet they themselves introduced hanging and\r\nflogging in public for petty civil crimes!_ The death penalty was never\r\ninflicted for civil crimes under the late Czar. It was never inflicted for\r\npolitical offenses. Only rarely was it inflicted for murder. It remained\r\nfor a so-called \"Socialist\" government to resort to such savagery as we\r\nfind described in the following extract from the recognized official organ\r\nof the Bolshevik government:\r\n\r\nTwo village robbers were condemned to death. All the people of Semenovskaia\r\nand the surrounding communes were invited to the ceremony. On July 6th, at\r\nmidday, a great crowd of interested spectators arrived at the village of\r\nLoupia. The organizers of the execution gave to each of the bystanders the\r\nopportunity of flogging the condemned to obtain from them supplementary\r\nconfessions. The number of blows was unlimited. Then a vote of the\r\nspectators was taken as to the method of execution. The majority was for\r\nhanging. In order that the spectacle could be easily seen, the spectators\r\nwere ranged in three ranks--the first row sat down, the second rested on\r\nthe knee, and the third stood up.[43]\r\n\r\nThe Bolshevik government created an All-Russian Extraordinary Commission,\r\nwhich in turn created Provincial and District Extraordinary Commissions.\r\nThese bodies--the local not less than the national--were empowered to make\r\narrests and even decree and carry out capital sentences. There was no\r\nappeal from their decisions; they were simply required to _report\r\nafterward_! Only members of the Bolshevik party were immune from this\r\nterror. Alminsky, a Bolshevist writer of note, felt called upon to protest\r\nagainst this hideous travesty of democratic justice, and wrote in\r\n_Pravda_:\r\n\r\nThe absence of the necessary restraint makes one feel appalled at the\r\n\"instruction\" issued by the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission to \"All\r\nProvincial Extraordinary Commissions,\" which says: \"The All-Russian\r\nExtraordinary Commission is perfectly independent in its work, carrying out\r\nhouse searches, arrests, executions, of which it _afterward_ reports to the\r\nCouncil of the People's Commissaries and to the Central Executive Council.\"\r\nFurther, the Provincial and District Extraordinary Commissions \"are\r\nindependent in their activities, and when called upon by the local\r\nExecutive Council present a report of their work.\" In so far as house\r\nsearches and arrests are concerned, a report made _afterward_ may result in\r\nputting right irregularities committed owing to lack of restraint. The same\r\ncannot be said of executions.... It can also be seen from the \"instruction\"\r\nthat personal safety is to a certain extent guaranteed only to members of\r\nthe government, of the Central Council, and of the local Executive\r\nCommittees. With the exception of these few persons all members of the\r\nlocal committees of the [Bolshevik] Party, of the Control Committees, and\r\nof the Executive Committee of the party may be shot at any time by the\r\ndecision of any Extraordinary Commission of a small district town if they\r\nhappen to be on its territory, and a report of that made _afterward._[44]\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nWhile in some respects, such as this terrible savagery, Bolshevism has\r\nout-Heroded Herod and surpassed the régime of the Romanovs in cruel\r\noppression, upon the whole its methods have been very like that of the\r\nlatter. There is really not much to choose between the ways of Stolypin and\r\nVon Plehve and those of the Lenine-Trotzky rule. The methods employed have\r\nbeen very similar and in not a few instances the same men who acted as the\r\nagents of espionage and tyranny for the Czar have served the Bolsheviki in\r\nthe same capacity. Just as under Czarism there was alliance with the Black\r\nHundreds and with all sorts of corrupt and vicious criminal agents, so we\r\nfind the same phenomenon recurring under the Bolsheviki. The time has not\r\nyet arrived for the compilation of the full record of Bolshevism in this\r\nparticular, but enough is known to justify the charge here made. That\r\nagents-provocateurs, spies, informers, police agents, and pogrom-makers\r\nformerly in the service of the Czar have been given positions of trust and\r\nhonor by Lenine and Trotzky unfortunately admits of no doubt whatever.\r\n\r\nIt was stated at a meeting of Russians held in Paris in the summer of 1917\r\nthat one of the first Russian regiments which refused to obey orders to\r\nadvance \"contained 120 former political or civil police agents out of 181\r\nrefractory soldiers.\" During the Kerensky régime, at the time when Lenine\r\nwas carrying on his propaganda through _Pravda_,[45] Vladimir Bourtzev\r\nexposed three notorious agents of the old police terror, provocateurs, who\r\nwere working on the paper. In August, 1917, the Jewish Conjoint Committee\r\nin London published a long telegram from the representative of the Jewish\r\nCommittee in Petrograd, calling attention to the fact that Lenine's party\r\nwas working in tacit agreement with the Black Hundreds. The telegram is\r\nhere given in full:\r\n\r\n    Extreme Russian reactionaries have allied themselves closely with\r\n    extreme revolutionaries, and Black Hundreds have entered into\r\n    tacit coalition with the Lenine party. In the army the former\r\n    agents and detectives of the political police carry on ardent\r\n    campaign for defeat, and in the rear the former\r\n    agents-provocateurs prepare and direct endless troubles.\r\n\r\n    The motives of this policy on the part of the reactionaries are\r\n    clear. It is the direct road to a counter-revolution. The\r\n    troubles, the insurrections, and shocking disorders which follow\r\n    provoke disgust at the Revolution, while the military defeats\r\n    prepare the ground for an intervention of the old friend of the\r\n    Russian Black Hundreds, William II, the counter-revolutionaries\r\n    work systematically for the defeat of the Russian armies,\r\n    sometimes openly, cynically.\r\n\r\n    Thus in their press and proclamations they go so far as to throw\r\n    the whole responsibility for the war and for the obstacles placed\r\n    in the way of a peace with Germany on the Jews. It is these\r\n    \"diabolical Jews,\" they say, who prevent the conclusion of peace\r\n    and insist on the continuation of the war, because they desire to\r\n    ruin Russia. Proclamations in this sense have been found, together\r\n    with a voluminous anti-Semitic literature, in the offices of the\r\n    party of Lenine Bolsheviki (Maximalists), and particularly at the\r\n    headquarters of the extreme revolutionaries, Château\r\n    Knheshinskaja. Salutations. BLANK.\r\n\r\nThat the leaders of the Bolsheviki, particularly Lenine and Trotzky, ever\r\nentered into any \"agreement\" with the Black Hundreds, or took any part in\r\nthe anti-Semitic campaign referred to, is highly improbable. Unless and\r\nuntil it is supported by ample evidence of a competent nature, we shall be\r\njustified in refusing to believe anything of the sort. It is, however,\r\nquite probable that provocateurs worming their way into Lenine's and\r\nTrotzky's good graces tried to use the Bolshevik agitation as a cover for\r\ntheir own nefarious work. As we have seen already, Lenine had previously\r\nbeen imposed upon by a notorious secret police agent, Malinovsky. But the\r\nopen association of the Bolsheviki with men who played a despicable rôle\r\nunder the old régime is not to be denied. The simple-minded reader of\r\nBolshevist literature who believes that the Bolshevik government, whatever\r\nits failings, has the merit of being a government by real working-men and\r\nworking-women, needs to be enlightened. Not only are Lenine and Trotzky not\r\nof the proletariat themselves, but they have associated with themselves\r\nmen whose lives have been spent, not as workers, not even as simple\r\nbourgeoisie, but as servants of the terror-system of the Czar. They have\r\nassociated with themselves, too, some of the most corrupt criminals in\r\nRussia. Here are a few of them:\r\n\r\nProfessor Kobozev, of Riga, joined the Bolsheviki and was active as a\r\ndelegate to the Municipal Council of Petrograd. According to the\r\ninformation possessed by the Russian revolutionary leaders, this Professor\r\nKobozev used to be a police spy, his special job being to make reports to\r\nthe police concerning the political opinions and actions of students and\r\nfaculty members. One of the very first men released from prison by the\r\nBolsheviki was one Doctor Doubrovine, who had been a leader of the Black\r\nHundreds, an organizer of many pogroms. He became an active Bolshevik.\r\nKamenev, the Bolshevik leader, friend of Lenine, is a journalist. He was\r\nformerly a member of the old Social Democratic party. Soon after the war\r\nbroke out he was arrested and behaved so badly that he was censured by his\r\nparty. Early in the Revolution of 1917 he was accused of serving the secret\r\npolice at Kiev. Bonno Brouevitch, Military Councilor to the Bolshevik\r\ngovernment, was a well-known anti-Semite who had been dismissed from his\r\nmilitary office on two occasions, once by the Czar's government and once by\r\nthe Provisional Government. General Komisarov, another of Lenine's trusted\r\nmilitary officials and advisers, was formerly a chief official of the\r\nCzar's secret police, known for his terrible persecution of the\r\nrevolutionists. Accused of high treason by the Provisional Government, he\r\nfled, but returned and joined the Lenine-Trotzky forces. Prince Andronikov,\r\nassociate of Rasputin; (Lenine's \"My friend, the Prince\"); Orlov, police\r\nagent and \"denouncer\" and secretary of the infamous Protopopov; Postnikov,\r\nconvicted and imprisoned as a German spy in 1910; Lepinsky, formerly in the\r\nCzar's secret police; and Gualkine, friend of the unspeakable Rasputin, are\r\nsome of the other men who have been closely identified with the\r\n\"proletarian régime\" of the Bolsheviki.[46] The man they released from\r\nprison and placed in the important position of Military Commander of\r\nPetrograd was Muraviev, who had been chief of the Czar's police and was\r\nregarded by even the moderate members of the Provisional Government, both\r\nunder Lvov and Kerensky, as a dangerous reactionary.[47] Karl Radek, the\r\nBohemian, a notorious leader of the Russian Bolsheviki, who undertook to\r\nstir up the German workers and direct the Spartacide revolt, was, according\r\nto _Justice_, expelled from the German Social Democratic party before the\r\nwar as a thief and a police spy.[48] How shall we justify men calling\r\nthemselves Socialists and proletarian revolutionists, who ally themselves\r\nwith such men as these, but imprison, harry, and abuse such men and women\r\nas Bourtzev, Kropotkin, Plechanov, Breshkovskaya, Tchaykovsky, Spiridonova,\r\nAgounov, Larokine, Avksentiev, and many other Socialists like them?\r\n\r\nIn surveying the fight of the Bolsheviki to establish their rule it is\r\nimpossible to fail to observe that their chief animus has been directed\r\nagainst other Socialists, rather than against members of the reactionary\r\nparties. That this has been the fact they do not themselves deny. For\r\nexample, the \"People's Commissary of Justice,\" G.I. Oppokov, better known\r\nas \"Lomov,\" declared in an interview in January, 1918: \"Our chief enemies\r\nare not the Cadets. Our most irreconcilable opponents are the Moderate\r\nSocialists. This explains the arrests of Socialists and the closing down of\r\nSocialist newspapers. Such measures of repression are, however, only\r\ntemporary.\"[49] And in the Soviet at Petrograd, July 30, 1918,\r\naccording to _Pravda_, Lachevitch, one of the delegates, said: \"The\r\nSocialist-Revolutionists of the Right and the Mensheviki are more dangerous\r\nfor the government of the Soviets than the bourgeoisie. But these enemies\r\nare not yet exterminated and can move about freely. The proletariat\r\nmust act. We ought, once for all, to rid ourselves of the\r\nSocialist-Revolutionists of the Right and of the Mensheviki.\"\r\n\r\nIn this summary of the Bolsheviki war against democracy, it will be\r\nobserved, no attempt has been made to gather all the lurid and fantastic\r\nstories which have been published by sensational journalists. The testimony\r\ncomes from Socialist sources of the utmost reliability, much of it from\r\nofficial Bolshevist sources. The system of oppression it describes is twin\r\nbrother to that which existed under the Romanovs, to end which hundreds of\r\nthousands of the noblest and best of our humankind gave up their lives.\r\nUnder the banner of Social Democracy a tyranny has been established as\r\ninfamous as anything in the annals of autocracy.\r\n\r\n    \"_O Liberty, what monstrous crimes are committed in thy great\r\n    name!_\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nBOLSHEVIST THEORY AND PRACTICE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nUtopia-making is among the easiest and most fascinating of all intellectual\r\noccupations. Few employments which can be called intellectual are easier\r\nthan that of devising panaceas for the ills of society, of demonstrating on\r\npaper how the rough places of life may be made plain and its crooked ones\r\nmade straight. And it is not a vain and fruitless waste of effort and of\r\ntime, as things so easy of achievement often are. Many of the noblest minds\r\nof all lands and all ages have found pleasure and satisfaction in the\r\nimagining of ideal commonwealths and by so doing have rendered great\r\nservice to mankind, enriching literature and, what is more important,\r\nstimulating the urge and passion for improvement and the faith of men in\r\ntheir power to climb to the farthest heights of their dreams. But the\r\nmaterial of life is hard and lacks the plastic quality of inspired\r\nimagination. Though there is probably no single evil which exists for which\r\na solution has not been devised in the wonderful laboratory of visioning,\r\nthe perversity of the subtle and mysterious thing called life is such that\r\nmany great and grave evils continue to challenge, perplex, and harass our\r\nhumankind.\r\n\r\nYet, notwithstanding the plain lesson of history and experience, the\r\nreminder impressed on every page of humanity's record, that between the\r\nglow and the glamour of the vision and its actual realization stretches a\r\nlong, long road, there are many simple-minded souls to whom the vision\r\ngleamed is as the goal attained. They do not distinguish between schemes on\r\npaper and ideals crystallized into living realities. This type of mind is\r\nfar more common than is generally recognized; that is why so many people\r\nquite seriously believe that the Bolsheviki have really established in\r\nRussia a society which conforms to the generous ideals of social democracy.\r\nThey have read the rhetorical \"decrees\" and \"proclamations\" in which the\r\nshibboleths of freedom and democracy abound, and are satisfied. Yet it\r\nought to be plainly evident to any intelligent person that, even if the\r\ndecrees and proclamations were as sound as they are in fact unsound, and as\r\ndefinite as they are in fact vague, they would afford no real basis for\r\njudging Bolshevism as an actual experiment in social polity. There is, in\r\nultimate analysis, only one test to apply to Bolshevism--namely, the test\r\nof reality. We must ask what the Bolsheviki did, not what they professed;\r\nwhat was the performance, not what was the promise.\r\n\r\nOf course, this does not mean that we are to judge result wholly without\r\nregard to aim. Admirable intention is still admirable as intention, even\r\nwhen untoward circumstance defeats it and brings deplorable results.\r\nBolshevism is not merely a body of belief and speculation. When the\r\nBolsheviki seized the government of Russia and began to attempt to carry\r\nout their ideas, Bolshevism became a living movement in a world of reality\r\nand subject to the acid test of pragmatic criteria. It must be judged by\r\nsuch a matter-of-fact standard as the extent to which it has enlarged or\r\ndiminished the happiness, health, comfort, freedom, well-being,\r\nsatisfaction, and efficiency of the greatest number of individuals. Unless\r\nthe test shows that it has increased the sum of good available for the\r\nmass, Bolshevism cannot be regarded as a gain. If, on the contrary, the\r\ntest shows that it has resulted in sensibly diminishing the sum of good\r\navailable to the greatest number of people, Bolshevism must be counted as a\r\nmove in the wrong direction, as so much effort lost. Nothing that can be\r\nurged on philosophical or moral grounds for or against the moral or\r\nintellectual impulses that prompted it can fundamentally change the\r\nverdict. Yet, for all that, it is well to examine the theory which inspires\r\nthe practice; well to know the manner and method of thinking, and the view\r\nof life, from which Bolshevism as a movement of masses of men and women\r\nproceeds.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, Bolshevism, as such, has no necessary connection with the\r\nphilosophy or the program of Socialism. Certain persons have established a\r\nworking relation between Socialism, a program, and Bolshevism, a method.\r\nThe connection is not inherently logical, but, on the contrary, wholly\r\nadventitious. As a matter of fact, Bolshevism can only be linked to the\r\nprogram of Socialism by violently and disastrously weakening the latter and\r\ndestroying its fundamental character. We shall do well to remember this; to\r\nremember that the method of action, and, back of the method, the philosophy\r\non which it rests and from which it springs, are separate and distinct from\r\nSocialism. They are incalculably older and they have been associated with\r\nvastly different programs. All that is new in Bolshevism is that a very old\r\nmethod of action, and a very old philosophy of action, have been seized\r\nupon by a new class which attempts to unite them to a new program.\r\n\r\nThat is all that is implied in the \"dictatorship of the proletariat.\"\r\nDictatorship by small minorities is not a new political phenomenon. All\r\nthat is new when the minority attempting to establish its dictatorship is\r\ncomposed of poor, propertyless people, is the fact of their economic\r\ncondition and status. That is the only difference between the dictatorship\r\nof Russia by the Romanov dynasty and the dictatorship of Russia by a small\r\nminority of determined, class-conscious working-people. It is not only the\r\nprecise forms of oppressive power used by them that are identically\r\ncharacteristic of Czarism and Bolshevism, but their underlying philosophy.\r\nBoth forms of dictatorship rest upon the philosophy of might as the only\r\nvalid right. Militarism, especially as it was developed under Prussian\r\nleadership, has exactly the same philosophy and aims at the same general\r\nresult, namely, to establish the domination and control of society by a\r\nminority class. The Bolsheviki have simply inverted Czarism and Militarism.\r\n\r\nWhat really shocks the majority of people is not, after all, the methods or\r\nthe philosophy of Bolshevism, but the fact that the Bolsheviki, belonging\r\nto a subject class, have seized upon the methods and philosophy of the most\r\npowerful ruling classes and turned them to their own account. There is a\r\nclass morality and a class psychology the subtle influences of which few\r\nperceive as a matter of habit, which, however, to a great extent shape our\r\njudgments, our sympathies, and our antipathies. Men who never were shocked\r\nwhen a Czar, speaking the language of piety and religion, indulged in the\r\nmost infamous methods and deeds of terror and oppression, are shocked\r\nbeyond all power of adequate expression when former subjects of that same\r\nCzar, speaking the language of the religion of democracy and freedom,\r\nresort to the same infamous methods of terror and oppression.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe idea that a revolting proletarian minority might by force impose its\r\nrule upon society runs through the history of the modern working class, a\r\nnote of impatient, desperate, menacing despair. The Bolsheviki say that\r\nthey are Marxian Socialists; that Marx believed in and advocated the\r\nsetting up, during the transitory period of social revolution, of the\r\n\"dictatorship of the proletariat.\" They are not quite honest in this claim,\r\nhowever; they are indulging in verbal tricks. It is true that Marx taught\r\nthat the proletarian dominion of society, as a preliminary to the abolition\r\nof all class rule of every kind, must be regarded as certain and\r\ninevitable. But it is not honest to claim the sanction of his teaching for\r\nthe seizure of political power by a small class, consisting of about 6 per\r\ncent. of the population, and the imposition by force of its rule upon the\r\nmajority of the population that is either unwilling or passive. That is the\r\nnegation of Marxian Socialism. _It is the essence of Marx's teaching that\r\nthe social revolution must come as a historical necessity when the\r\nproletariat itself comprises an overwhelming majority of the people_.\r\n\r\nLet us summarize the theory as it appears in the _Communist Manifesto_:\r\nMarx begins by setting forth the fact that class conflict is as old as\r\ncivilization itself, that history is very largely the record of conflicts\r\nbetween contending social classes. In our epoch, he argues, class conflict\r\nis greatly simplified; there is really only one division, that which\r\ndivides the bourgeoisie and the proletariat: \"Society as a whole is more\r\nand more splitting up into great hostile camps, into two great classes\r\ndirectly facing each other, bourgeoisie and proletariat.\" ... \"With the\r\ndevelopment of industry the proletariat not only increases in numbers; it\r\nbecomes concentrated in great masses, its strength grows, and it feels that\r\nstrength more.\" ... \"The proletarian movement is the _self-conscious,\r\nindependent movement of the immense majority in the interests of the\r\nimmense majority_.\" It is this \"immense majority\" that is to establish its\r\ndominion. Marx expressly points out that \"all previous historical movements\r\nwere movements of minorities, or in the interest of minorities.\" It is the\r\ngreat merit of the movement of the proletariat, as he conceives it, that it\r\nis the \"movement of the immense majority, in the interests of the immense\r\nmajority.\"\r\n\r\nClearly, when Lenine and his followers say that they take their doctrine of\r\nthe \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" from Marx, they pervert the truth;\r\nthey take from Marx only the phrase, not their fundamental policy. It is\r\nnot to be denied that there were times when Marx himself momentarily lapsed\r\ninto the error of Blanqui and the older school of Utopian, conspiratory\r\nSocialists who believed that they could find a short cut to social\r\ndemocracy; that by a surprise stroke, carefully prepared and daringly\r\nexecuted, a small and desperate minority could overthrow the existing\r\nsocial order and bring about Socialism. As Jaurès has pointed out,[50] the\r\nmind of Marx sometimes harked back to the dramatic side of the French\r\nRevolution, and was captivated by such episodes as the conspiracy of Babeuf\r\nand his friends, who in their day, while the proletariat was a small\r\nminority, even as it is in Russia now, sought to establish its dominion.\r\nBut it is well known that after the failure of the Paris Commune, in 1871,\r\nMarx once and for all abandoned all belief in this form of the\r\n\"dictatorship of the proletariat,\" and in the possibility of securing\r\nSocialism through the conspiratory action of minorities. He was even rather\r\nunwilling that the _Manifesto_ should be republished after that, except as\r\na purely historical document. It was in that spirit of reaction that he and\r\nEngels wrote in 1872 that passage--to which Lenine has given such an\r\nunwarranted interpretation--in which they say that the Commune had shown\r\nthat \"the working classes cannot simply take possession of the ready-made\r\nstate machine and set it in motion for their own aims.\"\r\n\r\nIt was no less an interpreter of Marx than his great collaborator and\r\nfriend, Frederick Engels, who, in 1895, stated the reasons for abandoning\r\nall belief in the possibility of accomplishing anything through political\r\nsurprises and through the action of small conscious and determined\r\nminorities at the head of unconscious masses:\r\n\r\n    History proved that we were wrong--we and those who like us, in\r\n    1848, awaited the speedy success of the proletariat. It became\r\n    perfectly clear _that economic conditions all over the Continent\r\n    were by no means as yet sufficiently matured for superseding the\r\n    capitalist organization of production_. This was proved by the\r\n    economic revolution which commenced on the continent of Europe\r\n    after 1848 and developed in France, Austria-Hungary, Poland, and,\r\n    recently, also in Russia, and made Germany into an industrial\r\n    state of the first rank--all on a capitalist basis, _which shows\r\n    that in 1848 the prevailing conditions were still capable of\r\n    expansion_. And to-day we have a huge international army of\r\n    Socialists.... If this mighty proletarian army has not yet reached\r\n    its goal, if it is destined to gain its ends only in a long drawn\r\n    out struggle, making headway but slowly, step by step, this only\r\n    proves how impossible it was in 1848 to change social conditions\r\n    by forcible means ... the time for small minorities to place\r\n    themselves at the head of the ignorant masses and resort to force\r\n    in order to bring about revolutions, is gone. _A complete change\r\n    in the organization of society can be brought about only by the\r\n    conscious co-operation of the masses_; they must be alive to the\r\n    aim in view; they must know what they want. The history of the\r\n    last fifty years has taught us that.[51]\r\n\r\nWhat Engels had in mind when he stressed the fact that history showed that\r\nin 1848 \"the prevailing conditions were still capable of expansion\" is the\r\ncentral Marxian doctrine of historical inevitability. It is surely less\r\nthan honest to claim the prestige and authority of Marx's teachings upon\r\nthe slender basis of a distorted version of his early thought, while\r\ncompletely ignoring the matured body of his doctrines. It may not matter\r\nmuch to the world to-day what Marx thought, or how far Lenine follows his\r\nteachings, but it is of importance that the claim set up by Lenine and\r\nTrotzky and many of their followers that they are guided by the principles\r\nof Marxian Socialism is itself demonstrably an evidence of moral or\r\nintellectual obliquity, which makes them very dangerous guides to follow.\r\nIt is of importance, too, that the claim they make allures many Socialists\r\nof trusting and uncritical minds to follow them.\r\n\r\nMany times in his long life Marx, together with Engels, found himself\r\nengaged in a fierce war against the very things Lenine and Trotzky and\r\ntheir associates have been trying to do. He thundered against Weitling, who\r\nwanted to have a \"daring minority\" seize the power of the state and\r\nestablish its dictatorship by a _coup d'état_. He was denounced as a\r\n\"reactionary\" by Willich and Kinkel because, in 1850, he rejected with\r\nscorn the idea of a sudden seizure of political power through conspiratory\r\naction, and had the courage to say that it would take fifty years for the\r\nworkers \"to fit themselves for political power.\" He opposed Lassalle's idea\r\nof an armed insurrection in 1862, because he was certain that the economic\r\ndevelopment had not yet reached the stage which alone could make a social\r\nchange possible. He fought with all the fierce impetuousness of his nature\r\nevery attempt of Bakunin to lead the workers to attempt the seizure of\r\npolitical power and forcibly establish their rule while still a\r\nminority.[52] He fought all these men because he had become profoundly\r\nconvinced that \"_no social order ever disappears before all the productive\r\nforces for which there is room in it have been developed; and new and\r\nhigher relations of production never appear before the material conditions\r\nof their existence have matured in the womb of the old society_.\"[53] No\r\n\"dictatorship of the proletariat,\" no action by any minority, however well\r\narmed or however desperate, can overcome that great law.\r\n\r\nThe \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" in the sense in which that term is\r\nused by the Russian Bolshevik leaders, and by those who in other countries\r\nare urging that their example be followed, is not a policy of Marxian\r\nSocialism. It is not a product of modern conditions. Rather it harks back\r\nto the earlier conspiratory Socialism of Blanqui, with its traditions\r\ninherited from Robespierre and Babeuf. So far as its advocates are\r\nconcerned, Marx and the whole modern Socialist movement might as well never\r\nhave existed at all. They take us back three-quarters of a century, to the\r\nera before Marx, to that past so remote in intellectual and moral\r\ncharacter, though recent in point of time, when the working class of no\r\ncountry in Europe possessed the right to vote--when the workers were\r\nindeed proletarians and not citizens; not only propertyless, but also\r\n\"without a fatherland.\"\r\n\r\nIn truth, it is not difficult to understand how this theory has found\r\nacceptance in Russia. It was not difficult to understand why Marx's\r\ndoctrine of economic evolution was for many years rejected by most Russian\r\nSocialists; why the latter took the view that Socialism must be more\r\nquickly attained, that capitalism was not a necessary precursor of\r\nSocialism in Russia, but that an intelligent leadership of passive masses\r\nwould successfully establish Socialism on the basis of the old Russian\r\ncommunal institutions. It was quite easy to understand the change that came\r\nwith Russia's industrial awakening, how the development of factory\r\nproduction gave an impetus to the Marxian theories. And, though it presents\r\na strange paradox, in that it comes at a time when, despite everything,\r\nRussian capitalism continues to develop, it is really not difficult to\r\nunderstand how and why pre-Marxian conceptions reappear in that great land\r\nof paradoxes. Politically and intellectually the position of the\r\nproletariat of Russia before the recent Revolution was that of the\r\nproletariat of France in 1848.\r\n\r\nBut that which baffles the mind of the serious investigator is the\r\nreadiness of so many presumably intelligent people living in countries\r\nwhere--as in America--wholly different conditions prevail to ignore the\r\ndifferences and be ready to abandon all the democratic advance made by the\r\nworkers. There is nothing more certain in the whole range of social and\r\npolitical life than the fact that the doctrine that the power of the state\r\nmust be seized and used by the proletariat against the non-proletarian\r\nclasses, even for a relatively brief period, _can only be carried out by\r\ndestroying all the democracy thus far achieved_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe validity of the foregoing contention can scarcely be questioned, except\r\nby those to whom phrases are of more consequence than facts, who place\r\ntheories above realities. The moment the Bolsheviki tried to translate\r\ntheir rhetorical propaganda for the dictatorship of the proletariat into\r\nthe concrete terms of political reality they found that they were compelled\r\nto direct their main opposition, not against the bourgeoisie, or even\r\nagainst capitalism, but against the newly created democracy. In the\r\nmovement to create a democratic government resting upon the basis of\r\nuniversal, direct, equal, and secret suffrage they saw a peril to their\r\nscheme far more formidable than militarism or capitalism. It was for this\r\nreason that they set themselves to the task of suppressing the Constituent\r\nAssembly. Only political simpletons will seriously regard the Bolshevik\r\nattempt to camouflage their motive by pretending that they determined to\r\ncrush the Constituent Assembly because its members were elected on a\r\nregister that was \"obsolete\" and therefore no longer truly represented the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe German Spartacides, who were acting in full accord with the Russian\r\nBolsheviki, had not that miserable excuse. Yet they set out by force of\r\narms to _prevent any election being held_. In this they were quite\r\nconsistent; they wanted to set up a dictatorship, and they knew that the\r\noverwhelming mass of the people wanted something very different. At a\r\ndinner of the Inter-Collegiate Socialist Society in New York, in December,\r\n1918, a spokesman for the German variety of Bolshevism blandly explained\r\nthat \"Karl Liebknecht and his comrades know that they cannot hope to get a\r\nmajority, therefore they are determined that no elections shall be held.\r\nThey will prevent this by force. After some time, perhaps, when a\r\nproletarian régime has existed long enough, and people have become\r\nconvinced of the superiority of the Socialist way, or at least grown used\r\nto it, _and it is safe to do so_, popular elections may be permitted.\"\r\nIncredible as it seems, this declaration was received with cheers by an\r\naudience which only a few minutes before had cheered with equal fervor\r\ndenunciations of \"encroachments upon American democracy.\"\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, the precise manner in which the Bolsheviki have acted\r\nagainst democracy was set forth, as far back as 1850, by a German, Johann\r\nvon Miquel, in a letter to Karl Marx. Miquel was born in Hanover, but his\r\nancestors were of French origin. He studied at Heidelberg and Göttingen,\r\nand became associated with the Socialist movement of the period. He settled\r\ndown to the practice of law, however, and when Hanover was annexed by\r\nPrussia he entered the Prussian parliament. After the \"dismissal of the\r\npilot,\" Bismarck, he became Prussian Minister of Finance, holding that\r\nposition for ten years. Liebknecht referred to him as \"my former _comrade\r\nin communismo_ and present Chancellor _in re_.\" This Miquel, while he was\r\nstill a Socialist, in 1850 wrote to Marx as follows:\r\n\r\n    The workers' party may succeed against the upper middle class and\r\n    what remains of the feudal element, _but it will be attacked on\r\n    its flank by the democracy_. We can perhaps give an anti-bourgeois\r\n    tone to the Revolution for a little while, _we can destroy the\r\n    essential conditions of bourgeois production_; but we cannot\r\n    possibly put down the small tradesmen and shopkeeping class, the\r\n    petty bourgeoisie. My motto is to secure all we can get. We should\r\n    prevent the lower and middle class from _forming any organizations\r\n    for as long a time as possible_ after the first victory, and\r\n    especially oppose ourselves in serried ranks to the plan of\r\n    calling a Constitutional Assembly. Partial terrorism, local\r\n    anarchy, must replace for us what we lack in bulk.\r\n\r\nWhat a remarkable anticipation of the Bolshevist methods of 1917-18 is thus\r\noutlined in this letter, written sixty-seven years before the Bolshevik\r\n_coup d'état!_ How literally Lenine, Trotzky and Co. have followed Herr von\r\nMiquel! They have desperately tried to \"give an anti-bourgeois tone to the\r\nRevolution,\" denouncing as bourgeois reactionaries the men and women whose\r\nlabors and sacrifices have made the Russian Socialist movement. They have\r\ndestroyed \"the essential conditions\" of bourgeois and of any other than the\r\nmost primitive production. They have set themselves in serried ranks in\r\nopposition to \"the plan of calling a Constitutional Assembly.\" They have\r\nsuppressed not only the organizations of the \"lower and middle class,\" but\r\nalso those of a great part of the working class, thus going beyond Miquel.\r\nFinally, to replace what they lack in bulk, they have resorted to \"partial\r\nterrorism and local anarchy.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it is in the name of revolutionary progress, of ultra-radicalism, that\r\nwe are called upon to revert to the tactics of desperation born of the\r\ndiscouraging conditions of nearly seventy years ago. A new philosophy has\r\ntaken possession of the easily possessed minds of Greenwich Village\r\nphilosophers and parlor revolutionists--a new philosophy of progress,\r\naccording to which revolutionary progress consists in the unraveling by\r\nfeverish fingers of the fabric woven through years of sacrifice; in\r\nabandoning high levels attained for the lower levels from which the\r\nstruggles of the past raised us; in harking back to the thoughts and the\r\ntactics of men who shouted their despairing, defiant cries into the gloom\r\nof the blackest period of the nineteenth century!\r\n\r\nUniversal, secret, equal, and direct suffrage was a fact in Russia, the\r\nfirst great achievement of the Revolution. Upon that foundation, and upon\r\nno other, it was possible to build an enduring, comprehensive social\r\ndemocracy. Against that foundation the Bolsheviki hurled their destructive\r\npower, creating a discriminating class suffrage, disfranchising a great\r\npart of the Russian people--not merely the bourgeoisie, but a considerable\r\npart of the working class itself. Chapter XIII of Article 4 of the\r\nConstitution of the \"Russian Socialist Federated Soviet Republic\" sets\r\nforth the qualifications for voting, as follows:\r\n\r\n    THE RIGHT TO VOTE\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER THIRTEEN\r\n\r\n\r\n    64. The right to vote and to be elected to the Soviets is enjoyed\r\n    by the following citizens, irrespective of religion, nationality,\r\n    domicile, etc., of the Russian Socialist Federated Soviet\r\n    Republic, of both sexes, who shall have completed their eighteenth\r\n    year by the day of election:\r\n\r\n    a. All who have acquired the means of living through labor that is\r\n    productive and useful to society, and also persons engaged in\r\n    housekeeping which enables the former to do productive work--i.e.,\r\n    laborers and employees of all classes who are employed in\r\n    industry, trade, agriculture, etc.; and peasants and Cossack\r\n    agricultural laborers who employ no help for the purpose of making\r\n    profits.\r\n\r\n    b. Soldiers of the army and navy of the Soviets.\r\n\r\n    c. Citizens of the two preceding categories who have to any degree\r\n    lost their capacity to work.\r\n\r\n    Note 1: Local Soviets may, upon approval of the central power,\r\n    lower the age standard mentioned herein.\r\n\r\n    Note 2: Non-citizens mentioned in Paragraph 20 (Article 2, Chapter\r\n    Five) have the right to vote.\r\n\r\n    65. The following persons enjoy neither the right to vote nor the\r\n    right to be voted for, even though they belong to one of the\r\n    categories enumerated above, namely:\r\n\r\n    a. Persons who employ hired labor in order to obtain from it an\r\n    increase in profits.\r\n\r\n    b. Persons who have an income without doing any work, such as\r\n    interest from capital, receipts from property, etc.\r\n\r\n    c. Private merchants, trade, and commercial brokers.\r\n\r\n    d. Monks and clergy of all denominations.\r\n\r\n    e. Employees and agents of the former police, the gendarme corps,\r\n    and the Okhrana (Czar's secret service), also members of the\r\n    former reigning dynasty.\r\n\r\n    f. Persons who have in legal form been declared demented or\r\n    mentally deficient, and also persons under guardianship.\r\n\r\n    g. Persons who have been deprived by a Soviet of their rights of\r\n    citizenship because of selfish or dishonorable offenses, for the\r\n    period fixed by the sentence.\r\n\r\nApparently the Constitution does not provide any standard for determining\r\nwhat labor is \"useful and productive to society,\" and leaves the way open\r\nfor a degree of arbitrariness on the part of some authority or other that\r\nis wholly incompatible with any generally accepted ideal of freedom and\r\ndemocracy. It is apparent from the text of paragraph 64, subdivision \"a\" of\r\nthe foregoing chapter that housekeeping as such is not included in the\r\ncategory of \"labor that is productive and useful to society,\" for a\r\nseparate category is made of it. The language used is that \"The right to\r\nvote and to be elected to the Soviets is enjoyed by.... All who have\r\nacquired the means of living through labor that is productive and useful to\r\nsociety, _and also_ persons engaged in housekeeping, which enables the\r\nformer to do productive work--_i.e._, laborers and employees of all classes\r\nwho are employed in industry, trade, agriculture, etc.\"\r\n\r\nThis _seems_ to mean that persons engaged in housekeeping can only vote if\r\nand when they are so engaged in order to enable other persons than\r\nthemselves to do \"productive work.\" It appears that housekeeping for\r\npersons not engaged in such productive work--for children, for\r\nexample--would not confer the right to vote. It is not possible to tell\r\nwith certainty what it _does_ mean, however, for there is probably not a\r\nsingle person in Russia or in the world who can tell exactly what this\r\nprecious instrument actually means. What standard is to be established to\r\ndetermine what labor is \"productive\" and \"useful\"? Is the journalist, for\r\ninstance, engaged in useful and productive labor? Is the novelist? is the\r\nagitator? Presumably the journalist employed in defending the Soviet\r\nRepublic against attacks by unfriendly critics would be doing useful work\r\nand be entitled to vote, but what about the journalist employed in making\r\nthe criticisms? Would the wife of the latter, no matter how much she might\r\ndisagree with her husband's views, be barred from voting, simply because\r\nshe was \"engaged in housekeeping\" for one whose labors were not regarded\r\n\"productive and useful to society\"? If the language used means anything at\r\nall, apparently she would be so disfranchised.\r\n\r\nUpon what ground is it decided that the \"private merchant\" may not vote?\r\nCertainly it is not because his labor is of necessity neither productive\r\nnor useful, for paragraph 65 says that even though belonging to one of the\r\ncategories of persons otherwise qualified to vote, the private merchant may\r\n\"enjoy neither the right to vote nor to be voted for.\" The keeper of a\r\nlittle grocery store, even though his income is not greater than that of a\r\nmechanic, and despite the fact that his store meets a local need and makes\r\nhis services, therefore, \"useful\" in the highest degree, cannot enjoy civic\r\nrights, simply because he is a \"merchant\"! The clergy of all denominations\r\nare excluded from the franchise. It does not matter, according to this\r\nconstitution, that a minister belongs to a church independent of any\r\nconnection with the state, that he is elected by people who desire his\r\nservices and is paid by them, that he satisfies them and is therefore\r\ndoing a \"useful service\"--if utility means the satisfying of needs--because\r\nhe is so employed he cannot vote.\r\n\r\nIt is clearly provided that \"peasants and Cossack agricultural laborers who\r\nemploy no help for the purpose of making profits\" can vote and be voted\r\nfor. But no persons \"who employ hired labor in order to obtain from it an\r\nincrease in profits\" may vote or be elected to office, _even though the\r\nwork they do is productive and useful to society._ A peasant who hires no\r\nassistance may vote, but if he decides that by employing a boy to help him\r\nhe will be able to give better attention to certain crops and make more\r\nmoney, even though he pays the boy every penny that the service is worth,\r\njudged by any standard whatever, he loses his vote and his civic status\r\nbecause, forsooth, he has gained in his net income as a result of his\r\nenterprise. And this is seriously put forward as the basis of government in\r\na nation needing an intense and universal stimulation of its economic\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nA militant suffragist friend of mine, whose passion for universal suffrage\r\nin America is so great that it leads her to join in all sorts of\r\ndemonstrations protesting against the failure of the United States Senate\r\nto pass the Susan B. Anthony amendment--even leading her to join in the\r\npublic burning of President Wilson's speeches, a queer emulation of the\r\nancient ecclesiastical bigotry of burning heretical books!--manages to\r\nunite to her passion for equal and unrestricted suffrage an equally\r\npassionate admiration for the Bolsheviki, arch-enemies of equal and\r\nunrestricted suffrage. Her case is not exceptional: it is rather typical of\r\nthe Bolshevik following in England and in America. Such minds are not\r\ngoverned and directed by rational processes, but by emotional impulses,\r\ngenerally of pathological origin.\r\n\r\nWhat the Bolshevik constitution would mean if practically applied to\r\nAmerican life to-day can be briefly indicated. The following classes would\r\ncertainly be entitled to vote and to be elected to office:\r\n\r\n1. All wage-earners engaged in the production of goods and utilities\r\nregarded by some designated authority as \"productive and useful to\r\nsociety.\"\r\n\r\n2. Teachers and educators engaged in the public service.\r\n\r\n3. All farmers owning and working their own farms without hired help of any\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n4. All wage-earners engaged in the public service as employees of the\r\nstate, subdivisions of the state, or public service corporations-such as\r\npostal clerks, street-railway workers, electricians, and so on.\r\n\r\n5. Wives and others engaged in keeping the homes of the foregoing, so as to\r\nenable them to work.\r\n\r\n6. The \"soldiers of the army and navy\"--whether all officers are included\r\nis not clear from the text.\r\n\r\nNow let us see what classes would be as certainly excluded from the right\r\nto vote and to be voted for.\r\n\r\n1. Every merchant from the keeper of a corner grocery store to the owner of\r\na great mercantile establishment.\r\n\r\n2. Every banker, every commission agent, every broker, every insurance\r\nagent, every real-estate dealer.\r\n\r\n3. Every farmer who hires help of any kind--even a single \"hand.\"\r\n\r\n4. Every petty contractor, garage-keeper, or other person employing any\r\nhired help whatever, including the professional writer who hires a\r\nstenographer, the doctor who hires a chauffeur, and the dentist who hires a\r\nmechanic assistant.\r\n\r\n5. Every clergyman and minister of the Gospel.\r\n\r\n6. Every person whose income is derived from inherited wealth or from\r\ninvested earnings, including all who live upon annuities provided by gift\r\nor bequest.\r\n\r\n7. Every person engaged in housekeeping for persons included in any of the\r\nforegoing six categories--including the wives of such disqualified persons.\r\n\r\nThere are many occupational groups whose civic status is not so easily\r\ndefined. The worker engaged in making articles of luxury, enjoyed only by\r\nthe privileged few, could hardly have a better claim to a vote than the\r\nhousekeeper of a man whose income was derived from foreign investments, or\r\nthan the chauffeur of a man whose income was derived from government bonds.\r\nAll three represent, presumably, types of that parasitic labor which\r\nsubjects those engaged in it to disfranchisement. Apparently, though not\r\ncertainly, then, the following would also be disfranchised:\r\n\r\n1. All lawyers except those engaged by the public authorities for the\r\npublic service.\r\n\r\n2. All teachers and educators other than those engaged in the public\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n3. All bankers, managers of industries, commercial travelers, experts, and\r\naccountants except those employed in the public service, or whose labor is\r\njudged by a competent tribunal to be necessary and useful.\r\n\r\n4. All editors, journalists, authors of books and plays, except as special\r\nprovision might be provided for individuals.\r\n\r\n5. All persons engaged in occupations which a competent tribunal decided to\r\nclassify as non-essential or non-productive.\r\n\r\nAny serious attempt to introduce such restrictions and limitations of the\r\nright of suffrage in America would provoke irresistible revolt. It would be\r\njustly and properly regarded as an attempt to arrest the forward march of\r\nthe nation and to turn its energies in a backward direction. It would be\r\njust as reactionary in the political world as it would be in the industrial\r\nworld to revert back to hand-tool production; to substitute the ox-team for\r\nthe railway system, the hand-loom for the power-loom, the flail for the\r\nthreshing-machine, the sickle for the modern harvesting-machine, the human\r\ncourier for the electric telegraph.\r\n\r\nYet we find a radical like Mr. Max Eastman giving his benediction and\r\napproval to precisely such a program in Russia as a substitute for\r\nuniversal suffrage. We find him quoting with apparent approval an article\r\nsetting forth Lenine's plan, hardly disguised, to disfranchise every farmer\r\nwho employs even a single hired helper.[54]\r\n\r\nLenine's position is quite clear. \"Only the proletariat leading on the\r\npoorest peasants (the semi-proletariat as they are called in our program)\r\n... may undertake the steps toward Socialism that have become absolutely\r\nunavoidable and non-postponable.... The peasants want to retain their small\r\nholdings and to arrive at some place of equal distribution.... So be it. No\r\nsensible Socialist will quarrel with a pauper peasant on this ground. If\r\nthe lands are confiscated, _so long as the proletarians rule in the great\r\ncenters, and all political power is handed over to the proletariat_, the\r\nrest will take care of itself.\"[55] Yet, in spite of Lenine's insistence\r\nthat all political power be \"handed over to the proletariat,\" in spite of a\r\nscore of similar utterances which might be quoted, and, finally, in spite\r\nof the Soviet Constitution which so obviously excludes from the right to\r\nvote a large part of the adult population, an American Bolshevist\r\npamphleteer has the effrontery to insult the intelligence of his readers\r\nby the stupidly and palpably false statement that \"even at the present time\r\n95 per cent. in Russia can vote, while in the United States only about 65\r\nper cent. can vote.\"[56]\r\n\r\nOf course it is only as a temporary measure that this dictatorship of a\r\nclass is to be maintained. It is designed only for the period of transition\r\nand adjustment. In time the adjustment will be made, all forms of social\r\nparasitism and economic exploitation will disappear, and then it will be\r\nboth possible and natural to revert to democratic government. Too simple\r\nand naïve to be trusted alone in a world so full of trickery and tricksters\r\nas ours are they who find any asurance in this promise. They are surely\r\namong the most gullible of our humankind!\r\n\r\nOf course, the answer to the claim is a very simple one: it is that no\r\nclass gaining privilege and power ever surrenders it until it is compelled\r\nto do so. Every one who has read the pre-Marxian literature dealing with\r\nthe dictatorship of the proletariat knows how insistent is the demand that\r\nthe period of dictatorship must be _prolonged as much as possible_. Even\r\nMarx himself insisted, on one occasion at least, that it must be maintained\r\nas long as possible,[57] and in the letter of Johann von Miquel, already\r\nquoted, we find the same thought expressed in the same terms, \"as long as\r\npossible.\" But even if we put aside these warnings of human experience and\r\nof recorded history, and persuade ourselves that in Russia we have a wholly\r\nnew phenomenon, a class possessing powers of dictatorship animated by a\r\nburning passion to relinquish those powers as quickly as possible, is it\r\nnot still evident that the social adjustments that must be made to reach\r\nthe stage where, according to the Bolshevik standards, political democracy\r\ncan be introduced, must, under the most favorable circumstances\r\nconceivable, take many, many years? Even Lenine admits that \"a sound\r\nsolution of the problem of increasing the productivity of labor\" (which\r\nlies at the very heart of the problem we are now discussing) \"requires at\r\nleast (especially after a most distressing and destructive war) several\r\nyears.\"[58]\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of social democracy the basis of the Bolshevik state\r\nis reactionary and unsound. The true Socialist policy is that set forth by\r\nWilhelm Liebknecht in the following words: \"The political power which the\r\nSocial Democracy aims at and which it will win, no matter what its enemies\r\nmay do, _has not for its object the establishment of the dictatorship of\r\nthe proletariat, but the suppression of the dictatorship of the\r\nbourgeoisie_.\"[59]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nDemocracy in government and in industry must characterize any system of\r\nsociety which can be justly called Socialist. Thirteen years ago I wrote,\r\n\"Socialism without democracy is as impossible as a shadow without\r\nlight.\"[60] That seemed to me then, as it seems to-day, axiomatic. And so\r\nthe greatest Socialist thinkers and leaders always regarded it. \"We have\r\nperceived that Socialism and democracy are inseparable,\" declared William\r\nLiebknecht, the well-beloved, in 1899.[61] Thirty years earlier, in 1869,\r\nhe had given lucid expression to the same conviction in these words:\r\n\"Socialism and democracy are not the same, but they are only different\r\nexpressions of the same fundamental idea. They belong to each other, round\r\nout each other, and can never stand in contradiction to each other.\r\nSocialism without democracy is pseudo-Socialism, just as democracy without\r\nSocialism is pseudo-democracy.\"[62] Democracy in industry is, as I have\r\ninsisted in my writing with unfailing consistency, as inseparable from\r\nSocialism as democracy in government.[63] Unless industry is brought within\r\nthe control of democracy and made responsive to the common will, Socialism\r\nis not attained.\r\n\r\nEverywhere the organized working class aspires to attain that industrial\r\ndemocracy which is the counterpart of political democracy. Syndicalism,\r\nwith all its vagaries, its crude reversal to outworn ideas and methods, is,\r\nnevertheless, fundamentally an expression of that yearning. It is the same\r\npassion that lies back of the Shop Stewards' movement in England, and that\r\ninspires the much more patiently and carefully developed theories and plans\r\nof the advocates of \"Guild Socialism.\" Motived by the same desire, our\r\nAmerican labor-unions are demanding, and steadily gaining, an increasing\r\nshare in the actual direction of industry. Joint control by boards composed\r\nof representatives of employers, employees, and the general public is, to\r\nan ever-increasing extent, determining the conditions of employment, wage\r\nstandards, work standards, hours of labor, choice and conduct of foremen,\r\nand many other matters of vital importance to the wage-earners. That we\r\nare still a long way from anything like industrial democracy is all too\r\npainfully true and obvious, but it is equally obvious that we are\r\nstruggling toward the goal, and that there is a serious purpose and\r\nintention to realize the ideal.\r\n\r\nImpelled by the inexorable logic of its own existence as a dictatorship,\r\nthe Bolshevik government has had to set itself against any and every\r\nmanifestation of democracy in industry with the same relentless force as it\r\nopposed democracy in government. True, owing to the fact that, following\r\nthe line of industrial evolution, the trade-union movement was not strongly\r\nenough developed to even attempt any organization for the expression of\r\nindustrial democracy comparable to the Constituent Assembly. It is equally\r\ntrue, however, that had such an organization existed the necessity to\r\nsuppress it, as the political organization was suppressed, would have\r\nproceeded inevitably and irresistibly from the creation of a dictatorship.\r\n_There cannot be, in any country, as co-existent forces, political\r\ndictatorship and industrial democracy._ It is also true that such\r\ndemocratic agencies as there were existing the Bolsheviki neglected.\r\n\r\nThat the Bolsheviki did not establish industrial democracy in its fullest\r\nsense is not to be charged to their discredit. Had Bolshevism never\r\nappeared, and had the Constituent Assembly been permitted to function\r\nunmolested and free, it would have taken many years to realize anything\r\nlike a well-rounded industrial democracy, for which a highly developed\r\nindustrial system is absolutely essential. The leaders of the Bolshevik\r\nmovement recognized from the first that the time had not yet arrived for\r\neven attempting to set up a Socialist commonwealth based on the social\r\nownership and democratic control of industry. Lenine frankly declared that\r\n\"Socialism cannot now prevail in Russia,\"[64] and Trotzky said, a month\r\nafter the _coup d'état_: \"We are not ready yet to take over all\r\nindustry.... For the present, we expect of the earnings of a factory to pay\r\nthe owner 5 or 6 per cent. yearly on his actual investment. What we aim at\r\nnow is _control_ rather than _ownership_.\"[65] He did not tell Professor\r\nRoss, who records this statement, on what grounds the owner of the property\r\nthus controlled by the Soviet government, and who thus becomes a partner of\r\nthe government, is to be excluded from the exercise of the franchise. But\r\nlet that pass.\r\n\r\nWhen the Bolsheviki seized the power of the state, they found themselves\r\nconfronted by a terrific task. Russia was utterly demoralized. An\r\nundeveloped nation industrially, war and internal strife had wrought havoc\r\nwith the industrial life she had. Her railways were neglected and the whole\r\ntransportation system, entirely inadequate even for peace needs, had, under\r\nthe strain of the war, fallen into chaos. After the March Revolution, as a\r\nnatural consequence of the intoxication of the new freedom, such\r\ndisciplines as had existed were broken down. Production fell off in a most\r\nalarming manner. During the Kerensky régime Skobelev, as Minister of Labor,\r\nrepeatedly begged the workers to prove their loyalty to the Revolution by\r\nincreased exertion and faithfulness in the workshops and factories. The\r\nBolsheviki, on their part, as a means of fighting the Provisional\r\nGovernment, preached the opposite doctrine, that of sabotage. In every\r\nmanner possible they encouraged the workers to limit production, to waste\r\ntime and materials, strike for trivial reasons, and, in short, do all that\r\nwas possible to defeat the effort to place industry upon a sound basis.\r\n\r\nWhen they found themselves in possession of the powers of government the\r\nBolshevik leaders soon had to face the stern realities of the conditions\r\nessential to the life of a great nation. They could not escape the\r\nnecessity of intensifying production. They had not only promised peace, but\r\nbread, and bread comes only from labor. Every serious student of the\r\nproblem has realized that the first great task of any Socialist society\r\nmust be _to increase the productivity of labor_. It is all very well for a\r\npopular propaganda among the masses to promise a great reduction in the\r\nhours of labor and, at the same time, a great improvement in the standards\r\nof living. The translation of such promises into actual achievements must\r\nprove to be an enormous task. To build the better homes, make the better\r\nand more abundant clothing, shoes, furniture, and other things required to\r\nfulfil the promise, will require a great deal of labor, and such an\r\norganization of industry upon a basis of efficiency as no nation has yet\r\ndeveloped. If the working class of this or any other country should take\r\npossession of the existing organization of production, there would not be\r\nenough in the fund now going to the capitalist class to satisfy the\r\nrequirements of the workers, _even if not a penny of compensation were paid\r\nto the expropriated owners_. Kautsky, among others, has courageously faced\r\nthis fact and insisted that \"it will be one of the imperative tasks of the\r\nSocial Revolution not simply to continue, but to increase production; the\r\nvictorious proletariat must extend production rapidly if it is to be able\r\nto satisfy the enormous demands that will be made upon the new régime.\"[66]\r\n From the first\r\nthis problem had to be faced by the Bolshevik government. We find Lenine\r\ninsisting that the workers must be inspired with \"idealism, self-sacrifice,\r\nand persistence\" to turn out as large a product as possible; that the\r\nproductivity of labor must be raised and a high level of industrial\r\nperformance as the duty of every worker be rigorously insisted upon. It is\r\nnot enough to have destroyed feudalism and the monarchy:\r\n\r\n    In every Socialist revolution, however, the main task of the\r\n    proletariat, and of the poorest peasantry led by it--and, hence,\r\n    also in the Socialist revolution in Russia inaugurated by us on\r\n    November 7, 1917, consists in the positive and constructive work\r\n    of establishing an extremely complex and delicate net of newly\r\n    organized relationships covering the systematic production and\r\n    distribution of products which are necessary for the existence of\r\n    tens of millions of people. The successful realization of such a\r\n    revolution depends on the original historical creative work of the\r\n    majority of the population, and first of all of the majority of\r\n    the toilers. _The victory of the Socialist revolution will not be\r\n    assured unless the proletariat and the poorest peasantry manifest\r\n    sufficient consciousness, idealism, self-sacrifice, and\r\n    persistence._ With the creation of a new--the Soviet--type of\r\n    state, offering to the oppressed toiling masses the opportunity to\r\n    participate actively in the free construction of a new society, we\r\n    have solved only a small part of the difficult task. _The main\r\n    difficulty is in the economic domain; to raise the productivity of\r\n    labor, to establish strict and universal accounting and control of\r\n    production and distribution, and actually to socialize\r\n    production._[67]\r\n\r\nLenine recognizes, as every thoughtful person must, that this task of\r\norganizing production and distribution cannot be undertaken by \"the\r\nproletariat and the poorest peasants.\" It requires a vast amount of highly\r\ndeveloped technical knowledge and skill, the result of long training and\r\nsuperior education. This kind of service is so highly paid, in comparison\r\nwith the wages paid to the manual workers, that it lifts those who perform\r\nthe service and receive the high salaries into the ranks of the\r\nbourgeoisie. Certainly, even though they are engaged in performing work of\r\nthe highest value and the most vital consequence, the specialists, experts,\r\nand directing managers of industry are not of the \"working class,\" as that\r\nterm is commonly employed. And no matter how we may speculate upon the\r\npossible attainment of approximate equality of income in some future near\r\nor remote, the fact is that the labor of such men can only be secured by\r\npaying much more than is paid to the manual workers.\r\n\r\nQuite wisely, the Bolshevik government decided that it must have such\r\nservices, no matter that they must be highly paid for; that they could only\r\nbe rendered by the hated bourgeoisie and that, in consequence, certain\r\ncompromises and relations with the bourgeoisie became necessary the moment\r\nthe services were engaged. The Bolshevik government recognized the\r\nimperative necessity of the service which only highly paid specialists\r\ncould give and wisely decided that no prejudice or theory must be permitted\r\nto block the necessary steps for Russia's reconstruction. In a spirit of\r\nintelligent opportunism, therefore, they subordinated shibboleths,\r\nprejudices, dogmas, and theories to Russia's necessity. The sanity of this\r\nopportunistic attitude is altogether admirable, but it contrasts strangely\r\nwith the refusal to co-operate with the bourgeoisie in establishing a\r\nstable democratic government--no less necessary for Russia's reconstruction\r\nand for Socialism. As a matter of fact, the very promptitude and sanity of\r\ntheir opportunism when faced by responsibility, serves to demonstrate the\r\ntruth of the contention made in these pages, that in refusing to co-operate\r\nwith others in building up a permanently secure democratic government,\r\nthey were actuated by no high moral principle, but simply by a desire to\r\ngain power. The position of Russia to-day would have been vastly different\r\nif the wisdom manifested in the following paragraphs had governed Lenine\r\nand his associates in the days when Kerensky was trying to save Russian\r\ndemocracy:\r\n\r\n    _Without the direction of specialists of different branches of\r\n    knowledge, technique, and experience, the transformation toward\r\n    Socialism is impossible_, for Socialism demands a conscious mass\r\n    movement toward a higher productivity of labor in comparison with\r\n    capitalism and on the basis which had been attained by capitalism.\r\n    Socialism must accomplish this movement forward in its own way, by\r\n    its own methods--to make it more definite, by Soviet methods. But\r\n    the specialists are inevitably bourgeois on account of the whole\r\n    environment of social life which made them specialists.... In view\r\n    of the considerable delay in accounting and control in general,\r\n    although we have succeeded in defeating sabotage, we have _not\r\n    yet_ created an environment which would put at our disposal the\r\n    bourgeois specialists. Many sabotagers are coming into our\r\n    service, but the best organizers and the biggest specialists can\r\n    be used by the state either in the old bourgeois way (that is, for\r\n    a higher salary) or in the new proletarian way (that is, by\r\n    creating such an environment of universal accounting and control\r\n    which would inevitably and naturally attract and gain the\r\n    submission of specialists). We were forced now to make use of the\r\n    old bourgeois method and agree to a very high remuneration for the\r\n    services of the biggest of the bourgeois specialists. All those\r\n    who are acquainted with the facts understand this, but not all\r\n    give sufficient thought to the significance of such a measure on\r\n    the part of the proletarian state. _It is clear that the measure\r\n    is a compromise, that it is a defection from the principles of the\r\n    Paris Commune and of any proletarian rule, which demand the\r\n    reduction of salaries to the standard of remuneration of the\r\n    average workers_--principles which demand that \"career hunting\" be\r\n    fought by deeds, not words.\r\n\r\n    Furthermore, it is clear that such a measure is not merely a halt\r\n    in a certain part and to a certain degree of the offensive against\r\n    capitalism (for capitalism is not a quantity of money, but a\r\n    definite social relationship), _but also a step backward by our\r\n    Socialist Soviet state_, which has from the very beginning\r\n    proclaimed and carried on a policy of reducing high salaries to\r\n    the standard of wages of the average worker.\r\n\r\n    ... The corrupting influence of high salaries is beyond\r\n    question--both on the Soviets ... and on the mass of the workers.\r\n    But all thinking and honest workers and peasants will agree with\r\n    us and will admit that we are unable to get rid at once of the\r\n    evil heritage of capitalism.... The sooner we ourselves, workers\r\n    and peasants, learn better labor discipline and a higher technique\r\n    of toil, making use of the bourgeois specialists for this purpose,\r\n    the sooner we will get rid of the need of paying tribute to these\r\n    specialists.[68]\r\n\r\nWe find the same readiness to compromise and to follow the line of least\r\nresistance in dealing with the co-operatives. From 1906 onward there had\r\nbeen an enormous growth of co-operatives in Russia. They were of various\r\nkinds and animated by varied degrees of social consciousness. They did not\r\ndiffer materially from the co-operatives of England, Belgium, Denmark,\r\nItaly, or Germany except in the one important particular that they relied\r\nupon bourgeois Intellectuals for leadership and direction to a greater\r\nextent than do the co-operatives in the countries named. They were\r\nadmirably fitted to be the nuclei of a socialized system of distribution.\r\nOut of office the Bolsheviki had sneered at these working-class\r\norganizations and denounced them as \"bourgeois corruptions of the militant\r\nproletariat.\" Necessity and responsibility soon forced the adoption of a\r\nnew attitude toward them. The Bolshevik government had to accept the\r\ndespised co-operatives, and even compromise Bolshevist principles as the\r\nprice of securing their services:\r\n\r\n    A Socialist state can come into existence only as a net of\r\n    production and consumption communes, which keep conscientious\r\n    accounts of their production and consumption, economize labor,\r\n    steadily increasing its productivity and thus making it possible\r\n    to lower the workday to seven, six, or even less hours. Anything\r\n    less than rigorous, universal, thorough accounting and control of\r\n    grain and of the production of grain, and later also of all other\r\n    necessary products, will not do. We have inherited from capitalism\r\n    mass organizations which can facilitate the transition to mass\r\n    accounting and control of distribution--the consumers'\r\n    co-operatives. They are developed in Russia less than in the more\r\n    advanced countries, but they comprise more than 10,000,000\r\n    members. The decree on consumers' associations which was recently\r\n    issued is extremely significant, showing clearly the peculiarity\r\n    of the position and of the problem of the Socialist Soviet\r\n    Republic at the present time.\r\n\r\n    The decree is an agreement with the bourgeois co-operatives and\r\n    with the workmen's co-operatives adhering to the bourgeois\r\n    standpoint. The agreement or compromise consists, firstly, in the\r\n    fact that the representatives of these institutions not only\r\n    participated in the deliberations on this decree, but had\r\n    practically received a determining voice, for parts of the decree\r\n    which met determined opposition from these institutions were\r\n    rejected. Secondly and essentially, the compromise consists in the\r\n    rejection by the Soviet authority of the principle of free\r\n    admission to the co-operatives (the only consistent principle from\r\n    the proletarian standpoint), and that the whole population of a\r\n    given locality should be _united in a single co-operative_. The\r\n    defection from this, the only Socialist principle, which is in\r\n    accord with the problem of doing away with classes, allows the\r\n    existence of working-class co-operatives (which in this case call\r\n    themselves working-class co-operatives only because they submit to\r\n    the class interests of the bourgeoisie). Lastly, the proposition\r\n    of the Soviet government completely to exclude the bourgeoisie\r\n    from the administration of the co-operatives was also considerably\r\n    weakened, and only owners of capitalistic commercial and\r\n    industrial enterprises are excluded from the administration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    If the proletariat, acting through the Soviets, should\r\n    successfully establish accounting and control on a national scale,\r\n    there would be no need for such compromise. Through the Food\r\n    Departments of the Soviets, through their organs of supply, we\r\n    would unite the population in one co-operative directed by the\r\n    proletariat, without the assistance from bourgeois co-operatives,\r\n    without concessions to the purely bourgeois principle which\r\n    compels the labor co-operatives to remain side by side with the\r\n    bourgeois co-operatives instead of wholly subjecting these\r\n    bourgeois co-operatives, fusing both?[69]\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nIt is no mood of captious, unfriendly criticism that attention is specially\r\ndirected to these compromises. Only political charlatans, ineffective\r\nquacks, and irresponsible soap-box orators see crime against the\r\nrevolutionary program of the masses in a wise and honest opportunism.\r\nHistory will not condemn the Bolsheviki for the give-and-take,\r\ncompromise-where-necessary policy outlined in the foregoing paragraphs. Its\r\ncondemnation will be directed rather against their failure to act in that\r\nspirit from the moment the first Provisional Government arose. Had they\r\njoined with the other Socialists and established a strong Coalition\r\nGovernment, predominantly Socialist, but including representatives of the\r\nmost liberal and democratic elements of the bourgeoisie, it would have been\r\npossible to bring the problems of labor organization and labor discipline\r\nunder democratic direction. It would not have been possible to establish\r\ncomplete industrial democracy, fully developed Socialism, nor will it be\r\npossible to do this for many years to come.\r\n\r\nBut it would have been easy and natural for the state to secure to the\r\nworkers a degree of economic assurance and protection not otherwise\r\npossible. It would have been possible, too, for the workers'\r\norganizations, recognized by and co-operating with the state, to have\r\nundertaken, in a large degree, the control of the conditions of their own\r\nemployment which labor organizations everywhere are demanding and gradually\r\ngaining. The best features of \"Guild Socialism\" could nowhere have been so\r\neasily adopted.[70] But instead of effort in these directions, we find the\r\nBolsheviki resorting to the _Taylor System of Scientific Management\r\nenforced by an individual dictator whose word is final and absolute, to\r\ndisobey whom is treason_! There is not a nation in the world with a\r\nworking-class movement of any strength where it would be possible to\r\nintroduce the industrial servitude here described:\r\n\r\n    The most conscious vanguard of the Russian proletariat has already\r\n    turned to the problem of increasing labor discipline. For\r\n    instance, the central committee of the Metallurgical Union and the\r\n    Central Council of the Trades Unions have begun work on respective\r\n    measures and drafts of decrees. This work should be supported and\r\n    advanced by all means. _We should immediately introduce piece work\r\n    and try it out in practice. We should try out every scientific and\r\n    progressive suggestion of the Taylor System_; we should compare\r\n    the earnings with the general total of production, or the\r\n    exploitation results of railroad and water transportation, and so\r\n    on.\r\n\r\n    The Russian is a poor worker in comparison with the workers of the\r\n    advanced nations, and this could not be otherwise under the régime\r\n    of the Czar and other remnants of feudalism. The last word of\r\n    capitalism in this respect, the Taylor System--as well as all\r\n    progressive measures of capitalism--combine the refined cruelty of\r\n    bourgeois exploitation and a number of most valuable scientific\r\n    attainments in the analysis of mechanical motions during work, in\r\n    dismissing superfluous and useless motions, in determining the\r\n    most correct methods of the work, the best systems of accounting\r\n    and control, etc. The Soviet Republic must adopt valuable and\r\n    scientific and technical advance in this field. _The possibility\r\n    of Socialism will be determined by our success in combining the\r\n    Soviet rule and the Soviet organization of management with the\r\n    latest progressive measures of capitalism. We must introduce in\r\n    Russia the study and the teaching of the Taylor System and its\r\n    systematic trial and adaptation_. While working to increase the\r\n    productivity of labor, we must at the same time take into account\r\n    the peculiarities of the transition period from capitalism to\r\n    Socialism, which require, on one hand, that we lay the foundation\r\n    for the Socialist organization of emulation, and, on the other\r\n    hand, _require the use of compulsion so that the slogan of the\r\n    dictatorship of the proletariat should not be weakened by the\r\n    practice of a too mild proletarian government_.\r\n\r\n    The resolution of the last (Moscow) Congress of the Soviets\r\n    advocates, as the most important problem at present, the creation\r\n    of \"efficient organization\" and higher discipline. Such\r\n    resolutions are now readily supported by everybody. But that their\r\n    realization requires compulsion, and _compulsion in the form of a\r\n    dictatorship_, is ordinarily not comprehended. And yet, it would\r\n    be the greatest stupidity and the most absurd opportunism to\r\n    suppose that the transition from capitalism to Socialism is\r\n    possible without compulsion and dictatorship. The Marxian theory\r\n    has long ago criticized beyond misunderstanding this petty\r\n    bourgeois-democratic and anarchistic nonsense. And Russia of\r\n    1917-18 confirms in this respect the Marxian theory so clearly,\r\n    palpably, and convincingly that only those who are hopelessly\r\n    stupid or who have firmly determined to ignore the truth can still\r\n    err in this respect. Either a Kornilov dictatorship (if Kornilov\r\n    be taken as Russian type of a bourgeois Cavaignac) or a\r\n    dictatorship of the proletariat--no other alternative is possible\r\n    for a country which is passing through an unusually swift\r\n    development with unusually difficult transitions and which suffers\r\n    from desperate disorganization created by the most horrible\r\n    war.[71]\r\n\r\nThis dictatorship is to be no light affair, no purely nominal force, but a\r\nrelentless iron-hand rule. Lenine is afraid that the proletariat is too\r\nsoft-hearted and lenient. He says:\r\n\r\n    But \"dictatorship\" is a great word. And great words must not be\r\n    used in vain. A dictatorship is an iron rule, with revolutionary\r\n    daring and swift and merciless in the suppression of the\r\n    exploiters as well as of the thugs (hooligans). And our rule is\r\n    too mild, quite frequently resembling jam rather than iron.[72]\r\n\r\nAnd so the dictatorship of the proletariat becomes the _dictatorship of a\r\nsingle person_, a super-boss and industrial autocrat: We must learn to\r\ncombine the stormy, energetic breaking of all restraint on the part of the\r\ntoiling masses _with iron discipline during work, with absolute submission\r\nto the will of one person, the Soviet director, during work_.[73]\r\n\r\nAs I copy these words from Lenine's book my memory recalls the days, more\r\nthan twenty years ago, when as a workman in England and as shop steward of\r\nmy union I joined with my comrades in breaking down the very things Lenine\r\nhere proposes to set up in the name of Socialism. \"Absolute submission to\r\nthe will of one person\" is not a state toward which free men will strive.\r\nNot willingly will men who enjoy the degree of personal freedom existing in\r\ndemocratic nations turn to this:\r\n\r\n    With respect to ... the significance of individual dictatorial\r\n    power from the standpoint of the specific problems of the present\r\n    period, we must say that every large machine industry--which is\r\n    the material productive source and basis of Socialism--requires an\r\n    absolute and strict unity of the will which directs the joint work\r\n    of hundreds, thousands, and tens of thousands of people. This\r\n    necessity is obvious from the technical, economical, and\r\n    historical standpoint, and has always been recognized by all those\r\n    who had given any thought to Socialism, as its prerequisite. But\r\n    how can we secure a strict unity of will? _By subjecting the will\r\n    of thousands_ to the will of one.\r\n\r\n    This subjection, _if the participants in the common work are\r\n    ideally conscious and disciplined_, may resemble the mild leading\r\n    of an orchestra conductor; but may take the acute form of a\r\n    dictatorship--if there is no ideal discipline and consciousness.\r\n    But at any rate, _complete submission to a single will is\r\n    absolutely necessary for the success of the processes of work\r\n    which is organized on the type of large machine industry_. This is\r\n    doubly true of the railways. And just this transition from one\r\n    political problem to another, which in appearance has no\r\n    resemblance to the first, constitutes the peculiarity of the\r\n    present period. The Revolution has just broken the oldest, the\r\n    strongest, and the heaviest chains to which the masses were\r\n    compelled to submit. So it was yesterday. And to-day, the same\r\n    Revolution (and indeed in the interest of Socialism) demands the\r\n    _absolute submission_ of the masses to the _single will_ of those\r\n    who direct the labor process. It is self-evident that it can be\r\n    realized only after great upheavals, crises, returns to the old;\r\n    only through the greatest strain of the energy of the proletarian\r\n    vanguard which is leading the people to the new order....\r\n\r\n    To the extent to which the principal problem of the Soviet rule\r\n    changes from military suppression to administration, suppression\r\n    and compulsion will, _as a rule, be manifested in trials, and not\r\n    in shooting on the spot_. And in this respect the revolutionary\r\n    masses have taken, after November 7, 1918, the right road and have\r\n    proved the vitality of the Revolution, when they started to\r\n    organize their own workmen's and peasants' tribunals, before any\r\n    decrees were issued dismissing the bourgeois-democratic judicial\r\n    apparatus. _But our revolutionary and popular tribunals are\r\n    excessively and incredibly weak. It is apparent that the popular\r\n    view of the courts--which was inherited from the régime of the\r\n    landowners and the bourgeoisie--as not their own, has not yet been\r\n    completely destroyed_. It is not sufficiently appreciated that the\r\n    courts serve to attract all the poor to administration (for\r\n    judicial activity is one of the functions of state\r\n    administration); that the court is _an organ of the rule of the\r\n    proletariat and of the poorest peasantry; that the court is a\r\n    means of training in discipline_. There is a lack of appreciation\r\n    of the simple and obvious fact that, if the chief misfortunes of\r\n    Russia are famine and unemployment, these misfortunes cannot be\r\n    overcome by any outbursts of enthusiasm, but only by thorough and\r\n    universal organization and discipline, in order to increase the\r\n    production of bread for men and fuel for industry, to transport it\r\n    in time, and to distribute it in the right way. That therefore\r\n    _responsibility_ for the pangs of famine and unemployment falls on\r\n    _every one who violates the labor discipline in any enterprise and\r\n    in any business_. That those who are responsible should be\r\n    discovered, tried, and _punished without mercy_. The petty\r\n    bourgeois environment, which we will have to combat persistently\r\n    now, shows particularly in the lack of comprehension of the\r\n    economic and political connection between famine and unemployment\r\n    and the _prevailing dissoluteness in organization and\r\n    discipline_--in the firm hold of the view of the small proprietor\r\n    that \"nothing matters, if only I gain as much as possible.\"\r\n\r\n    A characteristic struggle occurred on this basis in connection\r\n    with the last decree on railway management, the decree which\r\n    granted dictatorial (or \"unlimited\") power to individual\r\n    directors. The conscious (and mostly, probably, unconscious)\r\n    representatives of petty bourgeois dissoluteness contended that\r\n    the granting of \"unlimited\" (_i.e._, dictatorial) power to\r\n    individuals was a defection from the principle of board\r\n    administration, from the democratic and other principles of the\r\n    Soviet rule. Some of the Socialist-Revolutionists of the left wing\r\n    carried on a plainly demagogic agitation against the decree on\r\n    dictatorship, appealing to the evil instincts and to the petty\r\n    bourgeois desire for personal gain. The question thus presented is\r\n    of really great significance; firstly, the question of principle\r\n    is, in general, the appointment of individuals endowed with\r\n    unlimited power, the appointment of dictators, in accord with the\r\n    fundamental principles of the Soviet rule; secondly, in what\r\n    relation is this case--this precedent, if you wish--to the special\r\n    problems of the Soviet rule during the present concrete period?\r\n    Both questions deserve serious consideration.[74]\r\n\r\nWith characteristic ingenuity Lenine attempts to provide this dictatorship\r\nwith a theoretical basis which will pass muster as Marxian Socialism. He\r\nuses the term \"Soviet democracy\" as a synonym for democratic Socialism and\r\nsays there is \"absolutely no contradiction in principle\" between it and\r\n\"the use of dictatorial power of individuals.\" By what violence to reason\r\nand to language is the word _democracy_ applied to the system described by\r\nLenine? To use words with such scant respect to their meanings, established\r\nby etymology, history, and universal agreement in usage, is to invite and\r\nindeed compel the contempt of minds disciplined by reason's practices. As\r\nfor the claim that there is no contradiction in principle between\r\ndemocratic Socialism and the exercise of dictatorial power by individuals,\r\nbefore it can be accepted every Socialist teacher and leader of any\r\nstanding anywhere, the programs of all the Socialist parties, and their\r\npractice, must be denied and set aside. Whether democratic Socialism be\r\nwise or unwise, a practical possibility or an unrealizable idea, at least\r\nit has nothing in common with such reactionary views as are expressed in\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n    That the dictatorship of individuals has very frequently in the\r\n    history of revolutionary movements served as an expression and\r\n    means of realization of the dictatorship of the revolutionary\r\n    classes is confirmed by the undisputed experience of history. With\r\n    bourgeois democratic principles, the dictatorship of individuals\r\n    has undoubtedly been compatible. But this point is always treated\r\n    adroitly by the bourgeois critics of the Soviet rule and by their\r\n    petty bourgeois aides. On one hand, they declared the Soviet rule\r\n    simply something absurd and anarchically wild, carefully avoiding\r\n    all our historical comparisons and theoretical proofs that the\r\n    Soviets are a higher form of democracy; nay, more, the beginning\r\n    of a _Socialist_ form of democracy. On the other hand, they demand\r\n    of us a higher democracy than the bourgeois and argue: with your\r\n    Bolshevist (_i.e._, Socialist, not bourgeois) democratic\r\n    principles, with the Soviet democratic principles, individual\r\n    dictatorship is absolutely incompatible.\r\n\r\n    Extremely poor arguments, these. If we are not Anarchists, we must\r\n    admit the necessity of a state--that is, of _compulsion_, for the\r\n    transition from capitalism to Socialism. The form of compulsion is\r\n    determined by the degree of development of the particular\r\n    revolutionary class, then by such special circumstances as, for\r\n    instance, the heritage of a long and reactionary war, and then by\r\n    the forms of resistance of the bourgeoisie and the petty\r\n    bourgeoisie. _There is therefore absolutely no contradiction in\r\n    principle between the Soviet (Socialist) democracy and the use of\r\n    dictatorial power of individuals_. The distinction between a\r\n    proletarian and a bourgeois dictatorship consists in this: that\r\n    the first directs its attacks against the exploiting minority in\r\n    the interests of the exploited majority; and, further, in this,\r\n    that the first is accomplished (also through individuals) not only\r\n    by the masses of the exploited toilers, but also by the\r\n    organizations which are so constructed that they arouse these\r\n    masses to historical creative work (the Soviets belong to this\r\n    kind of organization).[75]\r\n\r\nThis, then, is Bolshevism, not as it is seen and described by unfriendly\r\n\"bourgeois\" writers, but as it is seen and described by the acknowledged\r\nintellectual and political leader of the Bolsheviki, Nikolai Lenine. I have\r\nnot taken any non-Bolshevist authority; I have not even restated his views\r\nin a summary of my own, lest into the summary might be injected some\r\nreflexes of my own critical thought. Bolshevism is revealed in all its\r\nreactionary repulsiveness as something between which and absolute,\r\nindividual dictatorial power there is \"absolutely no contradiction in\r\nprinciple.\" It will not avail for our American followers and admirers of\r\nthe Bolsheviki to plead that these things are temporary, compromises with\r\nthe ideal due to the extraordinary circumstances prevailing in Russia, and\r\nto beg a mitigation of the severity of our judgment on that account.\r\n\r\nThe answer to the plea is twofold: in the first place, they who offer it\r\nmust, if they are sincere, abandon the savagely critical attitude they have\r\nseen fit to adopt toward our own government and nation because with\r\n\"extraordinary conditions prevailing\" we have had introduced conscription,\r\nunusual restrictions of movement and of utterance, and so forth. How else,\r\nindeed, can their sincerity be demonstrated? If the fact that extraordinary\r\nconditions justified Lenine and his associates in instituting a régime so\r\ntyrannical, what rule of reason or of morals must be invoked to refuse to\r\ncount the extraordinary conditions produced in our own nation by the war as\r\njustification for the special measures of military service and discipline\r\nhere introduced?\r\n\r\nBut there is a second answer to the claim which is more direct and\r\nconclusive. It is not open to argument at all. It is found in the words of\r\nLenine himself, in his claim that there is absolutely no contradiction\r\nbetween the principle of individual dictatorship, ruling with iron hand,\r\nand the principle upon which Soviet government rests. There has been no\r\ncompromise here, for if there is no contradiction in principle no\r\ncompromise could have been required. Lenine is not afraid to make or to\r\nadmit making compromises; he admits that compromises have been made. It was\r\na compromise to employ highly salaried specialists from the bourgeoisie, \"a\r\ndefection from the principles of the Paris Commune and of any proletarian\r\nrule,\" as he says. It was a compromise, another \"defection from the only\r\nSocialist principle,\" to admit the right of the co-operatives to determine\r\ntheir own conditions of membership. Having made these declarations quite\r\ncandidly, he takes pains to assure us that there was no such defection from\r\nprinciple in establishing the absolute rule of an individual dictator,\r\nthat there was absolutely no contradiction in principle in this.[76]\r\n\r\nMoreover, there is no reason for regarding this dictatorship as a temporary\r\nthing, if Lenine himself is to be accepted as an authoritative spokesman.\r\nObviously, if there is nothing in the principle of an absolute individual\r\ndictatorship which is in contradiction to the Bolshevik ideal, there can be\r\nno Bolshevik principle which necessarily requires for its realization the\r\nending of such dictatorship. Why, therefore, may it not be continued\r\nindefinitely? Certainly, if the dictatorship is abolished it will not\r\nbe--if Lenine is to be seriously considered--on account of its\r\nincompatibility with Bolshevik principles.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nThe Bolshevik government of Russia is credited by many of its admirers in\r\nthis country with having solved the great land problem and with having\r\nsatisfied the land-hunger of the peasants. It is charged, moreover, that\r\nthe bitter opposition to the Bolsheviki is mainly due to agitation by the\r\nbourgeoisie, led by the expropriated landowners, who want to defeat the\r\nRevolution and to have their former titles to the land restored. Of course,\r\nit is true that, so far as they dare to do so, the former landowners\r\nactively oppose the Bolsheviki. No expropriated class ever acted otherwise,\r\nand it would be foolish to expect anything else. But any person who\r\nbelieves that the opposition of the great peasant Socialist organizations,\r\nand especially of the Socialist-Revolutionists, is due to the confiscation\r\nof the land, either consciously or unconsciously, is capable of believing\r\nanything and quite immune from rationality.\r\n\r\nThe facts in the case are, briefly, as follows: First, as Professor Ross\r\nhas pointed out,[77] the land policy of the Bolshevik government was a\r\ncompromise of the principles long advocated by its leaders, a compromise\r\nmade for political reasons only. Second, as Marie Spiridonova abundantly\r\ndemonstrated at an All-Russian Soviet Conference in July, 1918, the\r\nBolshevik government did not honorably live up to its agreement with the\r\nSocialist-Revolutionists of the Left. Third, so far as the land problem was\r\nconcerned there was not the slightest need or justification for the\r\nBolshevik _coup d'état_, for the reason that the problem had already been\r\nsolved on the precise lines afterward followed in the Soviet decree and the\r\nleaders of the peasants were satisfied. We have the authority of no less\r\ncompetent a witness than Litvinov, Bolshevist Minister to England, that\r\n\"the land measure had been 'lifted' bodily from the program of the\r\nSocialist-Revolutionists.\"[78] Each of these statements is amply sustained\r\nby evidence which cannot be disputed or overcome.\r\n\r\nThat the \"land decree\" which the Bolshevik government promulgated was a\r\ncompromise with their long-cherished principles admits of no doubt\r\nwhatever. Every one who has kept informed concerning Russian revolutionary\r\nmovements during the past twenty or twenty-five years knows that during all\r\nthat time one of the principal subjects of controversy among Socialists was\r\nthe land question and the proper method of solving it. The \"Narodniki,\" or\r\npeasant Socialists, later organized into the Socialist-Revolutionary party,\r\nwanted distribution of the land belonging to the big estates among the\r\npeasant communes, to be co-operatively owned and managed. They did not want\r\nland nationalization, which was the program of the Marxists--the Social\r\nDemocrats. This latter program meant that, instead of the land being\r\ndivided among the peasants' communal organizations, it should be owned,\r\nused, and managed by the state, the principles of large-scale production\r\nand wage labor being applied to agriculture in the same manner as to\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the Social Democratic party toward the peasant Socialists\r\nand their program was characterized by that same certainty that small\r\nagricultural holdings were to pass away, and by the same contemptuous\r\nattitude toward the peasant life and peasant aspirations that we find in\r\nthe writings of Marx, Engels, Liebknecht, and many other Marxists.[79]\r\nLenine himself had always adopted this attitude. He never trusted the\r\npeasants and was opposed to any program which would give the land to them\r\nas they desired. Mr. Walling, who spent nearly three years in Russia,\r\nincluding the whole period of the Revolution of 1905-06, writes of Lenine's\r\nposition at that time:\r\n\r\n    Like Alexinsky, Lenine awaits the agrarian movement ... and hopes\r\n    that a railway strike with the destruction of the lines of\r\n    communication and _the support of the peasantry_ may some day put\r\n    the government of Russia into the people's hands. However, I was\r\n    shocked to find that this important leader also, though he expects\r\n    a full co-operation with the peasants on equal terms, _during the\r\n    Revolution_, feels toward them a very _deep distrust_, thinking\r\n    them to a large extent bigoted and blindly patriotic, and fearing\r\n    that they may some day shoot down the working-men as the French\r\n    peasants did during the Paris Commune.\r\n\r\n    The chief basis for this distrust is, of course, the prejudiced\r\n    feeling that the peasants are not likely to become good\r\n    Socialists. _It is on this account that Lenine and all the Social\r\n    Democratic leaders place their hopes on a future development of\r\n    large agricultural estates in Russia and the increase of the\r\n    landless agricultural working class, which alone they believe\r\n    would prove truly Socialist_.[80]\r\n\r\nThe Russian Social Democratic Labor party, to which Lenine belonged, and of\r\nwhich he was an influential leader, adopted in 1906 the following program\r\nwith regard to land ownership:\r\n\r\n    1. Confiscation of Church, Monastery, Appanage, Cabinet,[81] and\r\n    private estate lands, _except small holdings_, and turning them\r\n    over, together with the state lands, to the great organs of local\r\n    administration, which have been democratically elected. Land,\r\n    however, which is necessary as a basis for future colonization,\r\n    together with the forests and bodies of water, which are of\r\n    national importance, are to pass into the control of the\r\n    democratic state.\r\n\r\n    2. Wherever conditions are unfavorable for this transformation,\r\n    the party declares itself in favor of a division among the\r\n    peasants of such of the private estates as already have the petty\r\n    farming conditions, or which may be necessary to round out a\r\n    reasonable holding.\r\n\r\nThis program was at the time regarded as a compromise. It did not wholly\r\nsuit anybody. The peasant leaders feared the amount of state ownership and\r\nmanagement involved. On the other hand, the extreme left wing of the Social\r\nDemocrats--Lenine and his friends--wanted the party to proclaim itself in\r\nfavor of _the complete nationalization of all privately owned land, even\r\nthat of the small peasant owners_, but were willing, provided the principle\r\nwere this stated, to accept, as a temporary expedient, division of the land\r\nin certain exceptional instances. On the other hand, the\r\nSocialist-Revolutionists wanted, not the distribution of lands among a\r\nmultitude of private owners, as is very generally supposed, but its\r\nsocialization. Their program provided for \"the socialization of all\r\nprivately owned lands--that is, the taking of them out of the private\r\nownership of persons into the public ownership and _their management by\r\ndemocratically organized leagues of communities with the purpose of an\r\nequitable utilization_.\" They wanted to avoid the creation of a great army\r\nof what they described as \"wage-slaves of the state\" and, on the other\r\nhand, they wanted to build upon the basis of Russian communism and, as far\r\nas possible, prevent the extension of capitalist methods--and therefore of\r\nthe class struggle--into the agrarian life of Russia.\r\n\r\nWhen the Bolsheviki came into power they sought first of all to split the\r\npeasant Socialist movement and gain the support of its extreme left wing.\r\nFor this reason they agreed to adopt the program of the Revolutionary\r\nSocialist party. It was Marie Spiridonova who made that arrangement\r\npossible. It was, in fact, a political deal. Lenine and Trotzky, on behalf\r\nof the Bolshevik government, agreed to accept the land policy of the\r\nSocialist-Revolutionists, and in return Spiridonova and her friends agreed\r\nto support the Bolsheviki. There is abundant evidence of the truth of the\r\nfollowing account of Professor Ross:\r\n\r\n    Among the first acts of the Bolsheviki in power was to square\r\n    their debt to the left wing of the Social Revolutionists, their\r\n    ally in the _coup d'état_. The latter would accept only one kind\r\n    of currency--the expropriation of the private landowners without\r\n    compensation and the transfer of all land into the hands of the\r\n    peasant communes. The Bolsheviki themselves, as good Marxists,\r\n    took no stock in the peasants' commune. As such, pending the\r\n    introduction of Socialism, they should, perhaps, have nationalized\r\n    the land and rented it to the highest bidder, regardless of\r\n    whether it was to be tilled in small parcels without hired labor\r\n    or in large blocks on the capitalistic plan. The land edict of\r\n    November does, indeed, decree land nationalism; however, the vital\r\n    proviso is added that \"the use of the land must be equalized--that\r\n    is, according to local conditions and according to the ability to\r\n    work and the needs of each individual,\" and further that \"the\r\n    hiring of labor is not permitted.\" The administrative machinery is\r\n    thus described: \"All the confiscated land becomes the land capital\r\n    of the nation. Its distribution among the working-people is to be\r\n    in charge of the local and central authorities, beginning with the\r\n    organized rural and urban communities and ending with the\r\n    provincial central organs.\" Such is the irony of fate. _Those who\r\n    had charged the rural land commune with being the most serious\r\n    brake upon Russia's progress, and who had stigmatized the\r\n    People-ists as reactionaries and Utopians, now came to enact into\r\n    law most of their tenets--the equalization of the use of land, the\r\n    prohibition of the hiring of labor, and everything else!_[82]\r\n\r\nThe much-praised land policy of the Bolsheviki is, in fact, not a Bolshevik\r\npolicy at all, but one which they have accepted as a compromise for\r\ntemporary political advantage. \"Claim everything in sight,\" said a noted\r\nAmerican politician on one occasion to his followers. Our followers of the\r\nBolsheviki, taught by a very clever propaganda, seem to be acting upon that\r\nmaxim. They claim for the Bolsheviki everything which can in the slightest\r\nmanner win favor with the American public, notwithstanding that it involves\r\nclaiming for the Bolsheviki credit to which they are not entitled. As early\r\nas May 18, 1917, it was announced by the Provisional Government that the\r\n\"question of the transfer of the land to the toilers\" was to be left to the\r\nConstituent Assembly, and there was never a doubt in the mind of any\r\nRussian Socialist how that body would settle it; never a moment when it was\r\ndoubted that the Constituent Assembly would be controlled by the\r\nSocialist-Revolutionary party. When Kerensky became Prime Minister one of\r\nthe first acts of his Cabinet was to create a special committee for the\r\npurpose of preparing the law for the socialization of the land and the\r\nnecessary machinery for carrying the law into effect. The All-Russian\r\nPeasants' Congress had, as early as May, five months before the Bolshevik\r\ncounter-revolution, adopted the land policy for which the Bolsheviki now\r\nare being praised by their admirers in this country. That policy had been\r\ncrystallized into a carefully prepared law which had been approved by the\r\nCouncil of Ministers. The Bolsheviki did no more than to issue a crudely\r\nconceived \"decree\" which they have never at any time had the power to\r\nenforce in more than about a fourth of Russia--in place of a law which\r\nwould have embraced all Russia and have been secure and permanent.\r\n\r\nOn July 16, 1918, Marie Spiridonova, in an address delivered in Petrograd,\r\nprotested vehemently against the manner in which the Bolshevik government\r\nwas departing from the policy it had agreed to maintain with regard to the\r\nland, and going back to the old Social Democratic ideas. She declared that\r\nshe had been responsible for the decree of February, which provided for the\r\nsocialization of the land. That measure provided for the abolition of\r\nprivate property in land, and placed all land in the hands of and under the\r\ndirection of the peasant communes. It was the old Socialist-Revolutionist\r\nprogram. But the Bolshevik government had not carried out the law of\r\nFebruary. Instead, it had resorted to the Social Democratic method of\r\nnationalization. In the western governments, she said, \"great estates were\r\nbeing taken over by government departments and were being managed by\r\nofficials, on the ground that state control would yield better results than\r\ncommunal ownership. Under this system the peasants were being reduced to\r\nthe state of slaves paid wages by the state. Yet the law provided that\r\nthese estates should be divided among the peasant communes to be tilled by\r\nthe peasants on a co-operative system.\"[83] Spiridonova protested against\r\nthe attitude of the Bolsheviki toward the peasants, against dividing them\r\ninto classes and placing the greater part of them with the bourgeoisie. She\r\ninsisted that the peasants be regarded as a single class, co-operating with\r\nthe industrial proletariat, yet distinct from it and from the bourgeoisie.\r\nFor our present purpose, it does not matter whether the leaders of the\r\nBolsheviki were right or wrong in their decision that state operation was\r\nbetter than operation by village co-operatives. Our sole concern here and\r\nnow is the fact that they did not keep faith with the section of the\r\npeasants they had won over to their side, and the fact that, as this\r\nincident shows, we cannot regard the formal decrees of the Soviet Republic\r\nas descriptions of realities.\r\n\r\nThe Bolsheviki remain to-day, as at the beginning, a counter-revolutionary\r\npower imposing its rule upon the great mass of the Russian people by armed\r\nforce. There can be little doubt that if a free election could be had\r\nimmediately upon the same basis as that on which the Constituent Assembly\r\nwas elected--namely, universal, secret, equal, direct suffrage, the\r\nBolsheviki would be overwhelmingly beaten. There can be little doubt that\r\nthe great mass of the peasantry would support, as before, the candidates of\r\nthe Socialist-Revolutionary party. It is quite true that some of the\r\nleaders of that party have consented to work with the Bolshevik government.\r\nCompromises have been effected; the Bolsheviki have conciliated the\r\npeasants somewhat, and the latter have, in many cases, sought to make the\r\nbest of a bad situation. Many have adopted a passive attitude. But there\r\ncan be no greater mistake than to believe that the Bolsheviki have solved\r\nthe land question to the satisfaction of the peasants and so won their\r\nallegiance.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nThis survey of the theories and practices of the Bolsheviki would invite\r\ncriticism and distrust if the peace program which culminated in the\r\nshameful surrender to Germany, the \"indecent peace\" as the Russians call\r\nit, were passed over without mention. And yet there is no need to tell here\r\na story with which every one is familiar. By that humiliating peace Russia\r\nlost 780,000 square kilometers of territory, occupied by 56,000,000\r\ninhabitants. She lost one-third of her total mileage of railways, amounting\r\nto more than 13,000 miles. She lost, also, 73 per cent. of her iron\r\nproduction; 89 per cent. of her coal production, and many thousands of\r\nfactories of various kinds. These latter included 268 sugar-refineries, 918\r\ntextile-factories, 574 breweries, 133 tobacco-factories, 1,685\r\ndistilleries, 244 chemical-factories, 615 paper-mills, and 1,073\r\nmachine-factories.[84] Moreover, it was not an enduring peace and war\r\nagainst Germany had to be resumed.\r\n\r\nIn judging the manner in which the Bolsheviki concluded peace with Germany,\r\nit is necessary to be on guard against prejudice engendered by the war and\r\nits passions. The tragi-comedy of Brest-Litovsk, and the pitiable rôle of\r\nTrotzky, have naturally been linked together with the manner in which\r\nLenine and his companions reached Russia with the aid of the German\r\nGovernment, the way in which all the well-known leaders of the Bolsheviki\r\nhad deliberately weakened the morale of the troops at the front, and their\r\npersistent opposition to all the efforts of Kerensky to restore the\r\nfighting spirit of the army--all these things combined have convinced many\r\nthoughtful and close observers that the Bolsheviki were in league with the\r\nGermans against the Allies. Perhaps the time is not yet ripe for passing\r\nfinal judgment upon this matter. Certainly there were ugly-looking\r\nincidents which appeared to indicate a close co-operation with the Germans.\r\n\r\nThere was, for example, the acknowledged fact that the Bolsheviki on\r\nseizing the power of government immediately entered into negotiations with\r\nthe notorious \"Parvus,\" whose rôle as an agent of the German Government is\r\nnow thoroughly established. \"Parvus\" is the pseudonym of one of the most\r\nsinister figures in the history of the Socialist movement, Dr. Alexander\r\nHelfandt. Born at Odessa, of German-Jewish descent, he studied in Germany\r\nand in the early eighteen-nineties attained prominence as a prolific and\r\nbrilliant contributor to the German Socialist review, _Die Neue Zeit_. He\r\nwas early \"exiled\" from Russia, but it was suspected by a great many\r\nSocialists that in reality his \"exile\" was simply a device to cover\r\nemployment in the Russian Secret Service as a spy and informer, for which\r\nthe prestige he had gained in Socialist circles was a valuable aid. When\r\nthe Revolution of 1905 broke out Helfandt returned to Russia under the\r\nterms of the amnesty declared at that time. He at once joined the Leninist\r\nsection of the Social Democratic party, the Bolsheviki. A scandal occurred\r\nsome time later, when the connection of \"Parvus\" with the Russian\r\nGovernment was freely charged against him. Among those who attacked him and\r\naccused him of being an agent-provocateur were Tseretelli, the\r\nSocialist-Revolutionist, and Miliukov, the leader of the Cadets.\r\n\r\nSome years later, at the time of the uprisings in connection with the Young\r\nTurk movement, \"Parvus\" turned up in Constantinople, where he was\r\npresumably engaged in work for the German Government. This was commonly\r\nbelieved in European political circles, though denied at the time by\r\n\"Parvus\" himself. One thing is certain, namely, that although he was\r\nnotoriously poor when he went there--his financial condition was well known\r\nto his Socialist associates--he returned at the beginning of 1915 a very\r\nrich man. He explained his riches by saying that he had, while at\r\nConstantinople, Bucharest, and Sofia, successfully speculated in war wheat.\r\nHe wrote this explanation in the German Socialist paper, _Die Glocke_, and\r\ndrew from Hugo Hasse the following observation: \"I blame nobody for being\r\nwealthy; I only ask if it is the rôle of a Social Democrat to become a\r\nprofiteer of the war.\"[85] Very soon we find this precious gentleman\r\nsettled in Copenhagen, where he established a \"Society for Studying the\r\nSocial Consequences of the War,\" which was, of course, entirely pro-German.\r\nThis society is said to have exercised considerable influence among the\r\nRussians in Copenhagen and to have greatly influenced many Danish\r\nSocialists to take Germany's side. According to _Pravda_, the Bolshevik\r\norgan, the German Government, through the intermediary of German Social\r\nDemocrats, established a working relation with Danish trade-unions and the\r\nDanish Social Democratic party, whereby the Danish unions got the coal\r\nneeded in Copenhagen at a figure below the market price. Then the Danish\r\nparty sent its leader, Borgdjerg, to Petrograd as an emissary to place\r\nbefore the Petrograd Soviet the terms of peace of the German Majority\r\nSocialists, which were, of course, the terms of the German Government. We\r\nfind \"Parvus\" at the same time, as he is engaged in this sort of intrigue,\r\nassociated with one Furstenberg in shipping drugs into Russia and food from\r\nRussia into Germany.[86] According to Grumbach,[87] he sought to induce\r\nprominent Norwegian Socialists to act as intermediaries to inform certain\r\nNorwegian syndicates that Germany would grant them a monopoly of coal\r\nconsignments if the Norwegian Social Democratic press would adopt a more\r\nfriendly attitude toward Germany and the Social Democratic members in the\r\nNorwegian parliament would urge the stoppage or the limitation of fish\r\nexports to England.\r\n\r\nDuring this period \"Parvus\" was bitterly denounced by Plechanov, by\r\nAlexinsky and other Russian Socialists as an agent of the Central Powers.\r\nHe was denounced also by Lenine and Trotzky and by _Pravda_. Lenine\r\ndescribed him as \"the vilest of bandits and betrayers.\" It was therefore\r\nsomewhat astonishing for those familiar with these facts to read the\r\nfollowing communication, which appeared in the German Socialist press on\r\nNovember 30, 1917, and, later, in the British Socialist organ, _Justice_:\r\n\r\n    STOCKHOLM, November 20.--The Foreign Relations Committee\r\n    of the Bolsheviki makes the following communication: \"The German\r\n    comrade, 'Parvus,' has brought to the Bolshevik Committee at\r\n    Stockholm the congratulations of the _Parteivorstand_ of the\r\n    Majority Social Democrats, who declare their solidarity with the\r\n    struggles of the Russian proletariat and with its request to begin\r\n    pourparlers immediately on the basis of a democratic peace without\r\n    annexations and indemnities. The Foreign Relations Committee of\r\n    the Bolsheviki has transmitted these declarations to the Central\r\n    Committee at Petrograd, as well as to the Soviets.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Hugo Hasse questioned Philipp Scheidemann about the negotiations which\r\nwere going on through \"Parvus,\" Scheidemann replied that it was the\r\nBolsheviki themselves who had invited \"Parvus\" to come to Stockholm for the\r\npurpose of opening up negotiations. This statement was denounced as a lie\r\nby Karl Radek in _Pravda_. Some day, doubtless, the truth will be known;\r\nfor the present it is enough to note the fact that as early as November the\r\nBolsheviki were negotiating through such a discredited agent of the Central\r\nPowers as Dr. Alexander Helfandt, otherwise \"Parvus,\" the well-known\r\nMarxist! Such facts as this, added to those previously noticed, tended\r\ninevitably to strengthen the conviction that Lenine and Trotsky were the\r\npliant and conscious tools of Germany all the time, and that the protests\r\nof Trotzky at Brest-Litovsk were simply stage-play.\r\n\r\nBut for all that, unless and until official, documentary evidence is\r\nforthcoming which proves them to have been in such relations with the\r\nGerman Government and military authorities, they ought not to be condemned\r\nupon the chain of suspicious circumstances, strong as that chain apparently\r\nis. The fact is that they had to make peace, and make it quickly. Kerensky,\r\nhad he been permitted to hold on, would equally have had to make a separate\r\npeace, and make it quickly. Only one thing could have delayed that for\r\nlong--namely, the arrival of an adequate force of Allied troops on the\r\nRussian front to stiffen the morale and to take the burden of fighting off\r\nfrom the Russians. Of that there was no sign and no promise or likelihood.\r\nKerensky knew that he would have had to make peace, at almost any cost and\r\non almost any terms, if he remained in power. If the Bolsheviki appear in\r\nthe light of traitors to the Allies, it should be remembered that pressure\r\nof circumstances would have forced even such a loyal friend of the Allies\r\nas Kerensky certainly proved himself to be to make a separate peace,\r\npractically on Germany's terms, in a very little while. It was not a matter\r\nof months, but of weeks at most, probably of days.\r\n\r\nRussia had to have peace. The nation was war-weary and exhausted. The\r\nAllies had not understood the situation--indeed, they never have understood\r\nRussia, even to this day--and had bungled right along. What made it\r\npossible for the Bolsheviki to assert their rule so easily was the fact\r\nthat they promised immediate peace, and the great mass of the Russian\r\nworkers wanted immediate peace above everything else. They were so eager\r\nfor peace that so long as they could get it they cared at the time for\r\nnothing. Literally nothing else mattered. As we have seen, the Bolshevik\r\nleaders had strenuously denied wanting to make a \"separate peace.\" There is\r\nlittle reason for doubting that they were sincere in this in the sense that\r\nwhat they wanted was a _general_ peace, if that could be possibly obtained.\r\nPeace they had to have, as quickly as possible. If they could not persuade\r\ntheir Allies to join with them in making such a general peace, they were\r\nwilling to make a _separate_ peace. That is quite different from _wanting_\r\na separate peace from the first. There was, indeed, in the demand made at\r\nthe beginning of December upon the Allies to restate their war aims within\r\na period of seven days an arrogant and provocative tone which invited the\r\nsuspicion that the ultimatum--for such it was--had not been conceived in\r\ngood faith; that it was deliberately framed in such a manner as to prevent\r\ncompliance by the Allies. And it may well be the fact that Lenine and\r\nTrotzky counted upon the inevitable refusal to convince the Russian people,\r\nand especially the Russian army, that the Allied nations were fighting for\r\nimperialistic ends, just as the Bolsheviki had always charged. The\r\nMachiavellian cunning of such a policy is entirely characteristic of the\r\nconspirator type.\r\n\r\nOn December 14th the armistice was signed at Brest-Litovsk, to last for a\r\nperiod of twenty-eight days. On December 5th, the Bolsheviki had published\r\nthe terms upon which they desired to effect the armistice. These terms,\r\nwhich the Germans scornfully rejected, provided that the German forces\r\nwhich had been occupied on the Russian front should not be sent to other\r\nfronts to fight against the Allies, and that the German troops should\r\nretire from the Russian islands held by them. In the armistice as it was\r\nfinally signed at Brest-Litovsk there was a clause which, upon its face,\r\nseemed to prove that Trotzky had kept faith with the Allies. The clause\r\nprovided that there should be no transfer of troops by either side, for the\r\npurpose of military operations, during the armistice, from the front\r\nbetween the Baltic and the Black Sea. This, however, was, from the German\r\npoint of view, merely a _pro forma_ arrangement, a \"scrap of paper.\"\r\nGrumbach wrote to _L'Humanité_ that on December 20th Berlin was full of\r\nGerman soldiers from the Russian front en route to the western front. He\r\nsaid that he had excellent authority for saying that this had been called\r\nto the attention of Lenine and Trotzky by the Independent Social Democrats,\r\nbut that, \"nevertheless, they diplomatically shut their eyes.\"[88] It is\r\nmore than probable that, in the circumstances, neither Lenine nor Trotzky\r\ncared much if at all for such a breach of the terms of the armistice, but,\r\nhad their attitude been otherwise, what could they have done? They were as\r\nhelpless as ever men were in the world, as subsequent events proved.\r\n\r\nAs one reads the numerous declamatory utterances of Trotzky in those\r\ncritical days of early December, 1917, the justice of Lenine's scornful\r\ndescription of his associate as a \"man who blinds himself with\r\nrevolutionary phrases\" becomes manifest. It is easy to understand the\r\nstrained relations that existed between the two men. His \"neither war nor\r\npeace\" gesture--it was no more!--his dramatic refusal to sign the stiffened\r\npeace terms, his desire to call all Russia to arms again to fight the\r\nGermans, his determination to create a vast \"Red Army\" to renew the war\r\nagainst Germany, and his professed willingness to \"accept the services of\r\nAmerican officers in training that army,\" all indicated a mind given to\r\nillusions and stone blind to realities. Lenine at least knew that the game\r\nwas up. He knew that the game into which he had so coolly entered when he\r\nleft Switzerland, and which he had played with all his skill and cunning,\r\nwas at an end and that the Germans had won. The Germans behaved with a\r\nperfidy that is unmatched in modern history, disregarded the armistice they\r\nhad signed, and savagely hurled their forces against the defenseless,\r\npartially demobilized and trusting Russians. There was nothing left for the\r\nBolsheviki to do. They had delivered Russia to the Germans. In March the\r\n\"indecent peace\" was signed, with what result we know. Bolshevism had been\r\nthe ally of Prussian militarism. Consciously or unconsciously, willingly or\r\nunwillingly, Lenine, Trotzky, and the other Bolshevik leaders had done all\r\nthat men could do to make the German military lords masters of the world.\r\nHad there been a similar movement in France, England, the United States, or\r\neven Italy, to-day the Hohenzollerns and Habsburgs would be upon their\r\nthrones, realizing the fulfilment of the Pan-German vision.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that so many of our American pacifists have glorified\r\nthe Bolsheviki, it may be well to remind them, if they have forgotten, or\r\nto inform them, if they do not know it, that their admiration is by no\r\nmeans reciprocated. Both Lenine and Trotzky have spoken and written in\r\nterms of utter disdain of pacifist movements in general and of the\r\npacifists of England and America in particular. They have insisted that,\r\n_in present society_, disarmament is really a reactionary proposal. The\r\ninclusion in the Constitution, which they have forced upon Russia by armed\r\nmight, of _permanent universal compulsory military service_ is not by\r\naccident. They believe that only when all nations have become Socialist\r\nnations will it be a proper policy for Socialists to favor disarmament. It\r\nwould be interesting to know how our American admirers and defenders of\r\nBolshevism, who are all anti-conscriptionists and ultra-pacifists, so far\r\nas can be discovered, reconcile their position with that of the Bolsheviki\r\nwho base their state, not as a temporary expedient, _but as a matter of\r\nprinciple_, upon universal, compulsory military service! What, one wonders,\r\ndo these American Bolsheviki worshipers think of the teaching of these\r\nparagraphs from an article by Lenine?[89]\r\n\r\n    Disarmament is a Socialistic ideal. In Socialist society there\r\n    will be no more wars, which means that disarmament will have been\r\n    realized. But he is not a Socialist who expects the realization of\r\n    Socialism _without_ the social revolution and the dictatorship of\r\n    the proletariat. Dictatorship is a government power, depending\r\n    directly upon force, and, in the twentieth century, force means,\r\n    not fists and clubs, but armies. To insert \"disarmament\" into our\r\n    program is equivalent to saying, we are opposed to the use of\r\n    arms. But such a statement would contain not a grain of Marxism,\r\n    any more than would the equivalent statement, we are opposed to\r\n    the use of force.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _A suppressed class which has no desire to learn the use of arms,\r\n    and to bear arms, deserves nothing else than to be treated as\r\n    slaves_. We cannot, unless we wish to transform ourselves into\r\n    mere bourgeois pacifists, forget that we are living in a society\r\n    based on classes, and that there is no escape from such a society,\r\n    except by the class struggle and the overthrow of the power of the\r\n    ruling class.\r\n\r\n    In every class society, whether it be based on slavery, serfdom,\r\n    or, as at the present moment, on wage-labor, the class of the\r\n    oppressors is an armed class. Not only the standing army of the\r\n    present day, but also the present-day popular militia--even in the\r\n    most democratic bourgeois republics, as in Switzerland--means an\r\n    armament of the bourgeoisie against the proletariat....\r\n\r\n    How can you, in the face of this fact, ask the revolutionary\r\n    Social Democracy to set up the \"demand\" of \"disarmament\"? _To ask\r\n    this is to renounce completely the standpoint of the class\r\n    struggle, to give up the very thought of revolution_. Our\r\n    watchword must be: to arm the proletariat so that it may defeat,\r\n    expropriate, and disarm the bourgeoisie. This is the only possible\r\n    policy of the revolutionary class, a policy arising directly from\r\n    the _actual evolution_ of capitalistic militarism, in fact,\r\n    dictated by the evolution. Only after having disarmed the\r\n    bourgeoisie can the proletariat, without betraying its historic\r\n    mission, cast all weapons to the scrap-heap; and there is no doubt\r\n    that the proletariat will do this, but only then, and not by any\r\n    possibility before then.\r\n\r\nHow is it possible for our extreme pacifists, with their relentless\r\nopposition to military force in all its forms to conscription, to universal\r\nmilitary service, to armaments of all kinds, even for defensive purposes,\r\nand to voluntarily enlisted armies even, to embrace Bolshevism with\r\nenthusiasm, resting as it does upon the basis of the philosophy so frankly\r\nstated by Lenine, is a question for which no answer seems wholly adequate.\r\nOf course, what Lenine advocates is class armament within the nation, for\r\ncivil war--the war of the classes. But he is not opposed to national\r\narmaments, as such, nor willing to support disarmament as a national policy\r\n_until the time comes when an entirely socialized humanity finds itself\r\nfreed from the necessity of arming against anybody_. There is probably not\r\na militarist in America to-day who, however bitterly opposed to disarmament\r\nas a present policy, would not agree that if, in some future time, mankind\r\nreaches the happy condition of universal Socialism, disarmament will then\r\nbecome practicable and logical. It would not be difficult for General Wood\r\nto subscribe to that doctrine, I think. It would not have been difficult\r\nfor Mr. Roosevelt to subscribe to it.\r\n\r\nNot only is Lenine willing to support national armaments, and even to fight\r\nfor the defense of national rights, whenever an attack on these is also an\r\nattack on proletarian rights--which he believes to be the case in the\r\ncontinued war against Germany, he goes much farther than this _and provides\r\na theoretical justification for a Socialist policy of passive acceptance of\r\never-increasing militarism_. He draws a strangely forced parallel between\r\nthe Socialist attitude toward the trusts and the attitude which ought to be\r\ntaken toward armaments. We know, he argues, that trusts bring great evils.\r\nAgainst the evils we struggle, but how? Not by trying to do away with the\r\ntrusts, for we regard the trusts as steps in progress. We must go onward,\r\nthrough the trust system to Socialism. In a similar way we should not\r\ndeplore \"the militarization of the populations.\" If the bourgeoisie\r\nmilitarizes all the men, and all the boys, nay, even all the women, why--so\r\nmuch the better! \"Never will the women of an oppressed class that is really\r\nrevolutionary be content\" to demand disarmament. On the contrary, they will\r\nencourage their sons to bear the arms and \"learn well the business of war.\"\r\nOf course, this knowledge they will use, \"not in order that they may shoot\r\nat their brothers, the workers of other countries, as they are doing in the\r\npresent war ... but in order that they may struggle against the bourgeoisie\r\nin their own country, in order that they may put an end to exploitation,\r\npoverty, and war, not by the path of good-natured wishes, but by the path\r\nof victory over the bourgeoisie and of disarmament of the bourgeoisie.\"[90]\r\n Universally the working class has taken a position the\r\nvery opposite of this. Universally we find the organized working class\r\nfavoring disarmament, peace agreements, and covenants in general opposing\r\nextensions of what Lenine describes as \"the militarization of populations.\"\r\nFor this universality of attitude and action there can only be one adequate\r\nexplanation--namely, the instinctive class consciousness of the workers.\r\nBut, according to Lenine, this instinctive class consciousness is all\r\nwrong; somehow or other it expresses itself in a \"bourgeois\" policy. The\r\nworkers ought to welcome the efforts of the ruling class to militarize and\r\ntrain in the arts of war not only the men of the nations, but the boys and\r\neven the women as well. Some day, if this course be followed, there will be\r\ntwo great armed classes in every nation and between these will occur the\r\ndecisive war which shall establish the supremacy of the most numerous and\r\npowerful class. Socialism is thus to be won, not by the conquests of reason\r\nand of conscience, but by brute force.\r\n\r\nObviously, there is no point of sympathy between this brutal and arrogant\r\ngospel of force and the striving of modern democracy for the peaceful\r\norganization of the world, for disarmament, a league of nations, and, in\r\ngeneral, the supplanting of force of arms by the force of reason and\r\nmorality. There is a Prussian quality in Lenine's philosophy. He is the\r\nTreitschke of social revolt, brutal, relentless, and unscrupulous, glorying\r\nin might, which is, for him, the only right. And that is what characterizes\r\nthe whole Bolshevik movement: it is the infusion into the class strife and\r\nstruggles of the world the same brutality and the same faith that might is\r\nright which made Prussian militarism the menace it was to civilization.\r\n\r\nAnd just as the world of civilized mankind recognized Prussian militarism\r\nas its deadly enemy, to be overcome at all costs, so, too, Bolshevism must\r\nbe overcome. And that can best be done, not by attempting to drown it in\r\nblood, but by courageously and consistently setting ourselves to the task\r\nof removing the social oppression, the poverty, and the servitude which\r\nproduce the desperation of soul that drives men to Bolshevism. The remedy\r\nfor Bolshevism is a sane and far-reaching program of constructive social\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPTUM: A PERSONAL STATEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book is the fulfilment of a promise to a friend. Soon after my return\r\nfrom Europe, in November, I spent part of a day in New York discussing\r\nBolshevism with two friends. One of these is a Russian Socialist, who has\r\nlived many years in America, a citizen of the United States, and a man\r\nwhose erudition and fidelity to the working-class movement during many\r\nyears have long commanded my admiration and reverence. The other friend is\r\na native American, also a Socialist. A sincere Christian, he has identified\r\nhis faith in the religion of Jesus and his faith in democratic Socialism.\r\nThe two are not conflicting forces, or even separate ones, but merely\r\ndifferent and complementary aspects of the same faith. He is a man who is\r\nuniversally loved and honored for his nobility of character and his\r\ngenerous idealism. While in Europe I had spent much time consulting with\r\nRussian friends in Paris, Rome, and other cities, and had collected a\r\nconsiderable amount of authentic material relating to Bolshevism and the\r\nBolsheviki. I had not the slightest intention of using this material to\r\nmake a book; in fact, my plans contemplated a very different employment of\r\nmy time. But, in the course of the discussion, my American Socialist friend\r\nasked me to \"jot down\" for him some of the things I had said, and,\r\nespecially, to write, in a letter, what I believed to be the psychology of\r\nBolshevism. This, in an unguarded moment, I undertook to do.\r\n\r\nWhen I set out, a few days later, to redeem my promise, I found that, in\r\norder to make things intelligible, it was absolutely necessary to explain\r\nthe historical backgrounds of the Russian revolutionary movement, to\r\ndescribe the point of view of various persons and groups with some detail,\r\nand to quote quite extensively from the documentary material I had\r\ngathered. Naturally, the limits of a letter were quickly outgrown and I\r\nfound that my response to my friend's innocent request approached the\r\nlength of a small volume. Even so, it was quite unsatisfactory. It left\r\nmany things unexplained and much of my own thought obscure. I decided then\r\nto rewrite the whole thing and make a book of it, thus making available for\r\nwhat I hope will be a large number of readers what I had at first intended\r\nonly for a dear friend.\r\n\r\nI am very conscious of the imperfections of the book as it stands. It has\r\nbeen written under conditions far from favorable, crowded into a very busy\r\nlife. My keenest critics will, I am sure, be less conscious of its defects\r\nthan I am. It is, however, an earnest contribution to a very important\r\ndiscussion, and, I venture to hope, with all its demerits, a useful one. If\r\nit aids a single person to a clearer comprehension of the inherent\r\nwrongfulness of the Bolshevist philosophy and method, I shall be rewarded.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_So here, my dear Will, is the fulfilment of my promise._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES\r\n\r\n\r\nI. AN APPEAL TO THE PROLETARIAT BY THE PETROGRAD WORKMEN'S AND\r\nSOLDIERS' COUNCIL\r\n\r\nII. HOW THE RUSSIAN PEASANTS FOUGHT FOR A CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY--A\r\nREPORT TO THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST BUREAU\r\n\r\nIII. FORMER SOCIALIST PREMIER OF FINLAND ON BOLSHEVISM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\nAN APPEAL TO THE PROLETARIAT BY THE PETROGRAD WORKMEN'S AND SOLDIERS'\r\nCOUNCIL\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMRADES:\r\n\r\n_Proletarians and Working-people of all Countries_:\r\n\r\nWe, Russian workers and soldiers, united in the Petrograd Workmen's and\r\nSoldiers' Delegate Council, send you our warmest greetings and the news of\r\ngreat events. The democracy of Russia has overthrown the century-old\r\ndespotism of the Czars and enters your ranks as a rightful member and as a\r\npowerful force in the battle for our common liberation. Our victory is a\r\ngreat victory for the freedom and democracy of the world. The principal\r\nsupporter of reaction in the world, the \"gendarme of Europe,\" no longer\r\nexists. May the earth over his grave become a heavy stone! Long live\r\nliberty, long live the international solidarity of the proletariat and its\r\nbattle for the final victory!\r\n\r\nOur cause is not yet entirely won. Not all the shadows of the old régime\r\nhave been scattered and not a few enemies are gathering their forces\r\ntogether against the Russian Revolution. Nevertheless, our conquests are\r\ngreat. The peoples of Russia will express their will in the Constitutional\r\nconvention which is to be called within a short time upon the basis of\r\nuniversal, equal, direct, and secret suffrage. And now it may already be\r\nsaid with certainty in advance that the democratic republic will triumph in\r\nRussia. The Russian people is in possession of complete political liberty.\r\nNow it can say an authoritative word about the internal self-government of\r\nthe country and about its foreign policy. And in addressing ourselves to\r\nall the peoples who are being destroyed and ruined in this terrible war, we\r\ndeclare that the time has come in which the decisive struggle against the\r\nattempts at conquest by the governments of all the nations must be begun.\r\nThe time has come in which the peoples must take the matter of deciding the\r\nquestions of war and peace into their own hands.\r\n\r\nConscious of its own revolutionary strength, the democracy of Russia\r\ndeclares that it will fight with all means against the policy of conquest\r\nof its ruling classes, and it summons the peoples of Europe to united,\r\ndecisive action for peace. We appeal to our brothers, to the\r\nGerman-Austrian coalition, and above all to the German proletariat. The\r\nfirst day of the war you were made to believe that in raising your weapons\r\nagainst absolutist Russia you were defending European civilization against\r\nAsiatic despotism. In this many of you found the justification of the\r\nsupport that was accorded to the war. Now also this justification has\r\nvanished. Democratic Russia cannot menace freedom and civilization.\r\n\r\nWe shall firmly defend our own liberty against all reactionary threats,\r\nwhether they come from without or within. The Russian Revolution will not\r\nretreat before the bayonets of conquerors, and it will not allow itself to\r\nbe trampled to pieces by outside military force.

Roubanovitch, member of the\r\nInternational Socialist Bureau.\r\n\r\n    _To the Executive Committee of the International Socialist\r\n    Bureau_:\r\n\r\n    DEAR COMRADES,--The citizen Inna Rakitnikov has lately\r\n    come from Petrograd to Paris for personal reasons that are\r\n    peculiarly tragic. At the time of her departure the Executive\r\n    Committee of the Second Soviet of Peasant Delegates of All-Russia,\r\n    of which she is one of the vice-presidents, requested her to make\r\n    to the International Socialist Bureau a detailed report of the\r\n    fights that this organization had to make against the Bolsheviki\r\n    in order to realize the convocation of the Constituent Assembly.\r\n\r\n    This is the report under the title of a document that I present\r\n    here, without commentary, asking you to communicate it without\r\n    delay to all the sections of the International. Two words of\r\n    explanation, only: First, I wish to draw your attention to the\r\n    fact that this is the second time that the Executive Committee of\r\n    the Soviet of the Peasants of All-Russia addresses itself publicly\r\n    to the International.\r\n\r\n    At the time of my journey to Stockholm in the month of September,\r\n    1917, I made, at a session of the Holland, Scandinavian committee,\r\n    presided over by Branting, a communication in the name of the\r\n    Executive Committee of the Soviet of Peasants. I handed over on\r\n    this occasion to our secretary, Camille Huysmans, an appeal to the\r\n    democrats of the entire world, in which the Executive Committee\r\n    indicated clearly its position in the questions of the world war\r\n    and of agrarian reform, and vindicated its place in the Workers'\r\n    and Socialist International family.\r\n\r\n    I must also present to you the author of this report. The citizen\r\n    Rakitnikov, a member of the Russian Revolutionary Socialist party,\r\n    has worked for a long time in the ranks of this party as a\r\n    publicist and organizer and propagandist, especially among the\r\n    peasants. She has known long years of prison, of Siberia, of\r\n    exile. Before and during the war until the beginning of the\r\n    Revolution she lived as a political fugitive in Paris. While being\r\n    a partizan convinced of the necessity of national defense of\r\n    invaded countries against the imperialistic aggression of German\r\n    militarism--in which she is in perfect accord with the members of\r\n    our party such as Stepan Sletof, Iakovlef, and many other\r\n    voluntary Russian republicans, all dead facing the enemy in the\r\n    ranks of the French army--the citizen Rakitnikov belonged to the\r\n    international group. I affirm that her sincere and matured\r\n    testimony cannot be suspected of partizanship or of dogmatic\r\n    partiality against the Bolsheviki, who, as you know, tried to\r\n    cover their follies and their abominable crimes against the plan\r\n    of the Russian people, and against all the other Socialist\r\n    parties, under the lying pretext of internationalist ideas, ideas\r\n    which they have, in reality, trampled under foot and betrayed.\r\n\r\n    Yours fraternally,\r\n    E. ROUBANOVITCH,\r\n    _June 28, 1918._\r\n    _Member of the B.S.I._\r\n\r\n\"The Bolsheviki who promised liberty, equality, peace, etc., have not been\r\nashamed to follow in the footsteps of Czarism. It is not liberty; it is\r\ntyranny.\" (Extract from a letter of a young Russian Socialist, an\r\nenthusiast of liberty who died all too soon.)\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n_Organization of the Peasants after the Revolution in Soviets of Peasant\r\nDelegates_\r\n\r\n\r\nA short time after the Revolution of February the Russian peasants grouped\r\nthemselves in a National Soviet of Peasant Delegates at the First Congress\r\nof the Peasants of All-Russia, which took place at Petrograd. The Executive\r\nCommittee of this Soviet was elected. It was composed of well-known leaders\r\nof the Revolutionary Socialist party and of peasant delegates sent from the\r\ncountry. Without adhering officially to the Revolutionary Socialist party,\r\nthe Soviet of Peasant Delegates adopted the line of conduct of this party.\r\nWhile co-ordinating its tactics with the party's, it nevertheless remained\r\nan organization completely independent. The Bolsheviki, who at this\r\nCongress attempted to subject the peasants to their influence, had not at\r\nthe time any success. The speeches of Lenine and the other members of this\r\nparty did not meet with any sympathy, but on the contrary provoked lively\r\nprotest. The Executive Committee had as its organ the paper _Izvestya of\r\nthe National Soviet of Peasant Delegates_. Thousands of copies of this were\r\nscattered throughout the country. Besides the central national Soviet there\r\nexisted local organizations, the Soviets, the government districts who were\r\nin constant communication with the Executive Committee staying at\r\nPetrograd.\r\n\r\nFrom its foundation the Executive Committee exercised great energy in the\r\nwork of the union and the organization of the peasant masses, and in the\r\ndevelopment of the Socialist conscience in their breasts. Its members\r\nspread thousands and hundreds of thousands of copies of pamphlets of the\r\nRevolutionary Socialist party, exposing in simple form the essence of\r\nSocialism and the history of the International explaining the sense and the\r\nimportance of the Revolution in Russia, the history of the fight that\r\npreceded it, showing the significance of the liberties acquired. They\r\ninsisted, above all, on the importance of the socialization of the soil and\r\nthe convocation of the Constituent Assembly. A close and living tie was\r\ncreated between the members of the Executive Committee staying at Petrograd\r\nand the members in the provinces. The Executive Committee was truly the\r\nexpression of the will of the mass of the Russian peasants.\r\n\r\nThe Minister of Agriculture and the principal agrarian committee were at\r\nthis time occupied in preparing the groundwork of the realization of\r\nsocialization of the soil; the Revolutionary Socialist party did not cease\r\nto press the government to act in this sense. Agrarian committees were\r\nformed at once to fight against the disorganized recovery of lands by the\r\npeasants, and to take under their control large properties where\r\nexploitation based on the co-operative principle was in progress of\r\norganization; agricultural improvements highly perfected would thus be\r\npreserved against destruction and pillage. At the same time agrarian\r\ncommittees attended to a just distribution among the peasants of the lands\r\nof which they had been despoiled.\r\n\r\nThe peasants, taken in a body, and in spite of the agrarian troubles which\r\noccurred here and there, awaited the reform with patience, understanding\r\nall the difficulties which its realization required and all the\r\nimpossibilities of perfecting the thing hastily. The Executive Committee of\r\nthe Soviet of Peasants' Delegates played in this respect an important rôle.\r\nIt did all it could to explain to the peasants the complexity of the\r\nproblem in order to prevent them from attempting anything anarchistic, or\r\nto attempt a disorganized recovery of lands which could end only with the\r\nfurther enrichment of peasants who were already rich.\r\n\r\nSuch was, in its general aspect, the action of the National Soviet of\r\nPeasants' Delegates, which, in the month of August, 1917, addressed,\r\nthrough the intermediary of the International Socialist Bureau, an appeal\r\nto the democracies of the world. In order to better understand the events\r\nwhich followed, we must consider for a moment the general conditions which\r\nat that time existed in Russia, and in the midst of which the action of\r\nthis organization was taking place.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n_The Difficulties of the Beginning of the Revolution_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe honeymoon of the Revolution had passed rapidly. Joy gave place to cares\r\nand alarms. Autocracy had bequeathed to the country an unwieldy heritage:\r\nthe army and the whole mechanism of the state were disorganized. Taking\r\nadvantage of the listlessness of the army, the Bolshevist propaganda\r\ndeveloped and at the same time increased the desire of the soldiers to\r\nfight no more. The disorganization was felt more and more at the front; at\r\nthe same time anarchy increased in the interior of the country; production\r\ndiminished; the productiveness of labor was lowered, and an eight-hour day\r\nbecame in fact a five or six-hour day. The strained relations between the\r\nworkers and the administration were such that certain factories preferred\r\nto close. The central power suffered frequent crises; the Cadets, fearing\r\nthe responsibilities, preferred to remain out of power.\r\n\r\nAll this created a state of unrest and hastened the preparations for the\r\nelection of the Constituent Assembly, toward which the eyes of the whole\r\ncountry were turned. Nevertheless, the country was far from chaos and from\r\nthe anarchy into which further events plunged it. Young Russia, not\r\naccustomed to liberty, without experience in political life and autonomous\r\naction, was far from that hopeless state to which the Bolsheviki reduced it\r\nsome months later. The people had confidence in the Socialists, in the\r\nRevolutionary Socialist party, which then held sway everywhere, in the\r\nmunicipalities, the zemstvos, and in the Soviets; they had confidence in\r\nthe Constituent Assembly which would restore order and work out the laws.\r\nAll that was necessary was to combat certain characteristics and certain\r\npeculiarities of the existence of the Russian people, which impelled them\r\ntoward anarchy, instead of encouraging them, as did the Bolsheviki, who, in\r\nthis respect, followed the line of least resistance.\r\n\r\nThe Bolshevist propaganda did all within its power to weaken the\r\nProvisional Government, to discredit it in the eyes of the people, to\r\nincrease the licentiousness at the front and disorganization in the\r\ninterior of the country. They proclaimed that the \"Imperialists\" sent the\r\nsoldiers to be massacred, but what they did not say is that under actual\r\nconditions it was necessary for a revolutionary people to have a\r\nrevolutionary army to defend its liberty. They spoke loudly for a\r\ncounter-revolution and for counter-revolutionaries who await but the\r\npropitious moment to take hold of the government, while in reality the\r\ncomplete failure of the insurrection of Kornilov showed that the\r\ncounter-revolution could rest on nothing, that there was no place for it\r\nthen in the life of Russia.\r\n\r\nIn fine, the situation of the country was difficult, but not critical. The\r\nunited efforts of the people and all the thousands of forces of the country\r\nwould have permitted it to come to the end of its difficulties and to find\r\na solution of the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n_The Insurrection of Kornilov_\r\n\r\n\r\nBut now the insurrection of Kornilov broke out. It was entirely unexpected\r\nby all the Socialist parties, by their central committees, and, of course,\r\nby the Socialist Ministers. Petrograd was in no way prepared for an attack\r\nof this kind. In the course of the evening of the fatal day when Kornilov\r\napproached Petrograd, the central committee of the Revolutionary Socialist\r\nparty received by telephone, from the Palace of Hiver, the news of the\r\napproach of Kornilovien troops. This news revolutionized everybody. A\r\nmeeting of all the organizations took place at Smolny; the members of the\r\nparty alarmed by the news, and other persons wishing to know the truth\r\nabout the events, or to receive indications as to what should be done, came\r\nthere to a reunion. It was a strange picture that Smolny presented that\r\nnight. The human torrent rushed along its corridors, committees and\r\ncommissions sat in its side apartments. They asked one another what was\r\nhappening, what was to be done. News succeeded news. One thing was certain.\r\nPetrograd was not prepared for the fight. It was not protected by anything,\r\nand the Cossacks who followed Kornilov could easily take it.\r\n\r\nThe National Soviet of Peasants' Delegates in the session that it held that\r\nsame night at No. 6 Fontaka Street adopted a resolution calling all the\r\npeasants to armed resistance against Kornilov. The Central Executive\r\nCommittee with the Soviet of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates established\r\na special organization which was to defend Petrograd and to fight against\r\nthe insurrection. Detachments of volunteers and of soldiers were directed\r\ntoward the locality where Kornilov was, to get information and to organize\r\na propaganda among the troops that followed the General, and in case of\r\nfailure to fight hand to hand. As they quit in the morning they did not\r\nknow how things would turn; they were rather pessimistic with regard to the\r\nissue of the insurrection for the Socialists.\r\n\r\nThe end of this conspiracy is known. The troops that followed Kornilov left\r\nhim as soon as they found out the truth. In this respect, everything ended\r\nwell, but this event had profound and regrettable circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe acute deplorable crisis of the central power became chronic. The\r\nCadets, compromised by their participation in the Kornilov conspiracy,\r\npreferred to remain apart. The Socialist-Revolutionists did not see clearly\r\nwhat there was at the bottom of the whole affair. _It was as much as any\r\none knew at the moment_. Kerensky, in presence of the menace of the\r\ncounter-revolution on the right and of the growing anarchy on the extreme\r\nleft, would have called to Petrograd a part of the troops from the front to\r\nstem the tide. Such was the rôle of different persons in this story. It is\r\nonly later, when all the documents will be shown, that the story can be\r\nverified, but at all events it is beyond doubt that the Revolutionary\r\nSocialist party was in no wise mixed in this conspiracy. The conspiracy of\r\nKornilov completely freed the hands of the Bolsheviki. In the Pravda, and\r\nin other Bolshevist newspapers, complaints were read of the danger of a new\r\ncounter-revolution which was developing with the complicity of Kerensky\r\nacting in accord or in agreement with the traitor Cadets. The public was\r\nexcited against the Socialist-Revolutionists, who were accused of having\r\nsecretly helped this counter-revolution. The Bolsheviki alone, said its\r\norgans, had saved the Revolution; to them alone was due the failure of the\r\nKornilov insurrection.\r\n\r\nThe Bolsheviki agitation assumed large proportions. Copies of the _Pravda_,\r\nspread lavishly here and there, were poisoned with calumny, campaigns\r\nagainst the other parties, boasting gross flatteries addressed to the\r\nsoldiers and appeals to trouble. Bolsheviki meetings permeated with the\r\nsame spirit were organized at Petrograd, Moscow, and other cities.\r\nBolshevist agitators set out for the front at the same time with copies of\r\nthe _Pravda_ and other papers, and the Bolsheviki enjoyed, during this\r\ntime--as Lenine himself admits--complete liberty. Their chiefs, compromised\r\nin the insurrection of June 3d, had been given their freedom.\r\n\r\nTheir principal watchword was \"Down with the war!\" \"Kerensky and the other\r\nconciliators,\" they cried, \"want war and do not want peace. Kerensky will\r\ngive you neither peace, nor land, nor bread, nor Constituent Assembly. Down\r\nwith the traitor and the counter-revolutionists! They want to smother the\r\nRevolution. We demand peace. We will give you peace, land to the peasants,\r\nfactories and work to the workmen!\" Under this simple form the agitation\r\nwas followed up among the masses and found a propitious ground, first among\r\nthe soldiers who were tired of war and athirst for peace. In the Soviet of\r\nthe Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates of Petrograd the Bolshevist party\r\nsoon found itself strengthened and fortified. Its influence was also\r\nconsiderable among the sailors of the Baltic fleet. Cronstadt was entirely\r\nin their hands. New elections of the Central Executive Committee of the\r\nSoviet of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates soon became necessary; they\r\ngave a big majority to the Bolsheviki. The old bureau, Tchcheidze at its\r\nhead, had to leave; the Bolsheviki triumphed clamorously.\r\n\r\nTo fight against the Bolsheviki the Executive Committee of the National\r\nSoviet of Peasants' Delegates decided at the beginning of December to call\r\na Second General Peasants' Congress. This was to decide if the peasants\r\nwould defend the Constituent Assembly or if they would follow the\r\nBolsheviki. This Congress had, in effect, a decisive importance. It showed\r\nwhat was the portion of the peasant class that upheld the Bolsheviki. It\r\nwas principally the peasants in soldiers' dress, the \"déclassé soldiers,\"\r\nmen taken from the country life by the war, from their natural\r\nsurroundings, and desiring but one thing, the end of the war. The peasants\r\nwho had come from the country had, on the contrary, received the mandate to\r\nuphold the Constituent Assembly. They firmly maintained their point of view\r\nand resisted all the attempts of the Bolsheviki and the\r\n\"Socialist-Revolutionists of the Left\" (who followed them blindly) to make\r\ntheir influence prevail. The speech of Lenine was received with hostility;\r\nas for Trotzky, who, some time before, had publicly threatened with the\r\nguillotine all the \"enemies of the Revolution,\" they prevented him from\r\nspeaking, crying out: \"Down with the tyrant! Guillotineur! Assassin!\" To\r\ngive his speech Trotzky, accompanied by his faithful \"capotes,\" was obliged\r\nto repair to another hall.\r\n\r\nThe Second Peasants' Congress was thus distinctly split into two parties.\r\nThe Bolsheviki tried by every means to elude a straight answer to the\r\nquestion, \"Does the Congress wish to uphold the Constituent Assembly?\" They\r\nprolonged the discussion, driving the peasants to extremities by every kind\r\nof paltry discussion on foolish questions, hoping to tire them out and thus\r\ncause a certain number of them to return home. The tiresome discussions\r\ncarried on for ten days, with the effect that a part of the peasants,\r\nseeing nothing come from it, returned home. But the peasants had, in spite\r\nof all, the upper hand; by a roll-call vote 359 against 314 pronounced\r\nthemselves for the defense without reserve of the Constituent Assembly.\r\n\r\nAny work in common for the future was impossible. The fraction of the\r\npeasants that pronounced itself for the Constituent Assembly continued to\r\nsit apart, named its Executive Committee, and decided to continue the fight\r\nresolutely. The Bolsheviki, on their part, took their partizans to the\r\nSmolny, declared to be usurpers of the Soviet of Peasants' Delegates who\r\npronounced themselves for the defense of the Constituante, and, with the\r\naid of soldiers, ejected the former Executive Committee from their premises\r\nand took possession of their goods, the library, etc.\r\n\r\nThe new Executive Committee, which did not have at its disposition Red\r\nGuards, was obliged to look for another place, to collect the money\r\nnecessary for this purpose, etc. Its members were able, with much\r\ndifficulty, to place everything upon its feet and to assure the\r\npublication of an organ (the _Izvestya_ of the National Soviet of Peasants'\r\nDelegates determined to defend the Constituent Assembly), to send delegates\r\ninto different regions, and to establish relations with the provinces, etc.\r\n\r\nTogether with the peasants, workmen and Socialist parties and numerous\r\ndemocratic organizations prepared themselves for the defense of the\r\nConstituent Assembly: The Union of Postal Employees, a part of the Union of\r\nRailway Workers, the Bank Employees, the City Employees, the food\r\ndistributors' organizations, the teachers' associations, the zemstvos, the\r\nco-operatives. These organizations believed that the _coup d'état_ of\r\nOctober 25th was neither legal nor just; they demanded a convocation with\r\nbrief delay of the Constituent Assembly and the restoration of the\r\nliberties that were trampled under foot by the Bolsheviki.\r\n\r\nThese treated them as _saboteurs_, \"enemies of the people,\" deprived them\r\nof their salaries, and expelled them from their lodgings. They ordered\r\nthose who opposed them to be deprived of their food-cards. They published\r\nlists of strikers, thus running the risk of having them lynched by the\r\ncrowds. At Saratov, for example, the strike of postal workers and\r\ntelegraphers lasted a month and a half. The institutions whose strike would\r\nhave entailed for the population not only disorganization, but an arrest of\r\nall life (such as the railroads, the organizations of food distributers),\r\nabstained from striking, only asking the Bolsheviki not to meddle with\r\ntheir work. Sometimes, however, the gross interference of the Bolsheviki in\r\nwork of which they understood nothing obliged those opposed to them, in\r\nspite of everything, to strike. It is to be noted also that the professors\r\nof secondary schools were obliged to join the strike movements (the\r\nsuperior schools had already ceased to function at this time) as well as\r\nthe theatrical artistes: a talented artist, Silotti, was arrested; he\r\ndeclared that even in the time of Czarism nobody was ever uneasy on\r\naccount of his political opinions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n_The Bolsheviki and the Constituent Assembly_\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time of the accomplishment of their _coup d'état_, the Bolsheviki\r\ncried aloud that the ministry of Kerensky put off a long time the\r\nconvocation of the Constituante (which was a patent lie), that they would\r\nnever call the Assembly, and that they alone, the Bolsheviki, would do it.\r\nBut according as the results of the elections became known their opinions\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning they boasted of their electoral victories at Petrograd and\r\nMoscow. Then they kept silent, as if the elections had no existence\r\nwhatever. But the _Pravda_ and the _Izvestya_ of the Soviet of Workmen's\r\nand Soldiers' Delegates continued to treat as caluminators those who\r\nexposed the danger that was threatening the Constituent Assembly at the\r\nhands of the Bolsheviki. They did not yet dare to assert themselves openly.\r\nThey had to gain time to strengthen their power. They hastily followed up\r\npeace pourparlers, to place Russia and the Constituent Assembly, if this\r\nmet, before an accomplished fact.\r\n\r\nThey hastened to attract the peasants to themselves. That was the reason\r\nwhich motived the \"decree\" of Lenine on the socialization of the soil,\r\nwhich decree appeared immediately after the _coup d'état_. This decree was\r\nsimply a reproduction of a Revolutionary Socialists' resolution adopted at\r\na Peasants' Congress. What could the socialization of the soil be to Lenine\r\nand all the Bolsheviki in general? They had been, but a short time before,\r\nprofoundly indifferent with regard to this Socialist-Revolutionist\r\n\"Utopia.\" It had been for them an object of raillery. But they knew that\r\nwithout this \"Utopia\" they would have no peasants. And they threw them\r\nthis mouthful, this \"decree,\" which astonished the peasants. \"Is it a law?\r\nIs it not a law? Nobody knows,\" they said.\r\n\r\nIt is the same desire to have, cost what it may, the sympathy of the\r\npeasants that explains the union of the Bolsheviki with those who are\r\ncalled the \"Socialist-Revolutionists of the Left\" (for the name\r\nSocialist-Revolutionist spoke to the heart of the peasant), who played the\r\nstupid and shameful rôle of followers of the Bolsheviki, with a blind\r\nweapon between their hands.\r\n\r\nA part of the \"peasants in uniform\" followed the Bolsheviki to Smolny. The\r\nGermans honored the Bolsheviki by continuing with them the pourparlers for\r\npeace. The Bolshevist government had at its disposal the Red Guards, well\r\npaid, created suddenly in the presence of the crumbling of the army for\r\nfear of remaining without the help of bayonets. These Red Guards, who later\r\nfled in shameful fashion before the German patrols, advanced into the\r\ninterior of the country and gained victories over the unarmed populace. The\r\nBolsheviki felt the ground firm under their feet and threw off the mask. A\r\ncampaign against the Constituent Assembly commenced. At first in _Pravda_\r\nand in _Izvestya_ were only questions. What will this Constituent Assembly\r\nbe? Of whom will it be composed? It is possible that it will have a\r\nmajority of servants of the bourgeoisie--Cadets Socialist-Revolutionists.\r\n_Can we confide to such a Constituent Assembly the destinies of the Russian\r\nRevolution? Will it recognize the power of the Soviets?_ Then came certain\r\nhypocritical \"ifs.\" \"If,\" yes, \"if\" the personnel of the Constituent\r\nAssembly is favorable to us; \"if\" it will recognize the power of the\r\nSoviets, it can count on their support. _If not--it condemns itself to\r\ndeath_.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist-Revolutionists of the Left in their organ, _The Flag of\r\nLabor_, repeated in the wake of the Bolsheviki, \"We will uphold the\r\nConstituent Assembly in _the measure we_--\"\r\n\r\nAfterward we see no longer questions or prudent \"ifs,\" but distinct\r\nanswers. \"The majority of the Constituent Assembly is formed,\" said the\r\nBolsheviki, \"of Socialist-Revolutionists and Cadets--that is to say,\r\nenemies of the people. This composition assures it of a\r\ncounter-revolutionary spirit. Its destiny is therefore clear. Historic\r\nexamples come to its aid. _The victorious people has no need of a\r\nConstituent Assembly. It is above the Constituante_. It has gone beyond\r\nit.\" The Russian people, half illiterate, were made to believe that in a\r\nfew weeks they had outgrown the end for which millions of Russians had\r\nfought for almost a century; that they no longer had need of the most\r\nperfect form of popular representation, such as did not exist even in the\r\nmost cultivated countries of western Europe. To the Constituent Assembly,\r\nlegislative organ due to equal, direct, and secret universal suffrage, they\r\nopposed the Soviets, with their recruiting done by hazard and their\r\nelections to two or three degrees,[92] the Soviets which were the\r\nrevolutionary organs and not the legislative organs, and whose rôle besides\r\nnone of those who fought for the Constituent Assembly sought to diminish.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n_The Fight Concentrates Around the Constituent Assembly_\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was a maneuver whose object appeared clearly. The defenders of the\r\nConstituent Assembly had evidence of what was being prepared. The peasants\r\nwho waited with impatience the opening of the Constituent Assembly sent\r\ndelegates to Petrograd to find out the cause of the delay of the\r\nconvocation. These delegates betook themselves to the Executive Committee\r\nof the Soviet of Peasants' Delegates (11 Kirillovskaia Street), and to the\r\nSocialist-Revolutionist fraction of the members of the Constituante (2\r\nBolotnai Street). This last fraction worked actively at its proper\r\norganization. A bureau of organization was elected, commissions charged to\r\nelaborate projects of law for the Constituante. The fraction issued\r\nbulletins explaining to the population the program which the\r\nSocialist-Revolutionists were going to defend at the Constituante. Active\r\nrelations were undertaken with the provinces. At the same time the members\r\nof the fraction, among whom were many peasants and workmen, followed up an\r\nactive agitation in the workshops and factories of Petrograd, and among the\r\nsoldiers of the Preobrajenski Regiment and some others. The members of the\r\nExecutive Committee of the Soviet of Peasants' Delegates worked in concert\r\nwith them. It was precisely the opinion of the peasants and of the workmen\r\nwhich had most importance in the fight against the Bolsheviki. They, the\r\ntrue representatives of the people, were listened to everywhere; people\r\nwere obliged to reckon with them.\r\n\r\nIt was under these conditions that the Democratic Conference met. Called by\r\nthe Provisional Government, it comprised representatives of the Soviets, of\r\nparties, of organizations of the army, peasant organizations,\r\nco-operatives, zemstvos, agricultural committees, etc. Its object was to\r\nsolve the question of power until the meeting of the Constituent Assembly.\r\n\r\nAt this conference the Bolsheviki formed only a small minority; but they\r\nacted as masters of the situation, calling, in a provocative manner,\r\nall those who were not in accord with them, \"Kornilovist,\r\ncounter-revolutionaries, traitors!\" Because of this attitude the\r\nconference, which ought to have had the character of an assembly deciding\r\naffairs of state, took on the character of a boisterous meeting, which\r\nlasted several days of unending twaddle. What the Bolsheviki wanted was a\r\nverbal victory--to have shouted more loudly than their opponents. The same\r\nspeeches were repeated every day. Some upheld a power exclusively\r\nSocialist, others--the majority composed of delegates from different\r\ncorners of the country--sanctioned an agreement with all the democratic\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nThe provincial delegates, having come with a view to serious work, returned\r\nto their homes, carrying with them a painful impression of lost\r\nopportunities, of useless debates.\r\n\r\nThere remained but a few weeks before the convocation of the Constituent\r\nAssembly. Those who voted against a government exclusively Socialist did\r\nnot think that, under the troublesome conditions of the time, they could\r\nexpose the country to the risk of a dispersion of strength; they feared the\r\npossible isolation of the government in face of certain elements whose help\r\ncould not be relied on. But they did not take into account a fact which had\r\nresulted from the Kornilovist insurrection: the natural distrust of the\r\nworking masses in presence of all the non-Socialists, of those who--not\r\nbeing in immediate contact with them--placed themselves, were it ever so\r\nlittle, more on the right.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic conference resulted in the formation of a Pre-Parliament.\r\nThere the relations, between the forces in presence of each other, were\r\nabout the same. Besides the Bolsheviki soon abandoned the Pre-Parliament,\r\nfor they were already preparing their insurrection which curtailed the\r\ndissolution of that institution.\r\n\r\n\"We are on the eve of a Bolshevik insurrection\"--such was, at this time,\r\nthe opinion of all those who took part in political life. \"We are rushing\r\nto it with dizzy rapidity. The catastrophe is inevitable.\" But what is very\r\ncharacteristic is this, that, while preparing their insurrection, the\r\nBolsheviki, in their press, did not hesitate to treat as liars and\r\ncalumniators all those who spoke of the danger of this insurrection, and\r\nthat on the eve of a conquest of power (with arms ready) premeditated and\r\nwell prepared in advance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the whole period that preceded the Bolshevik insurrection a great\r\ncreative work was being carried on in the country in spite of the\r\nundesirable phenomena of which we have spoken above.\r\n\r\n1. With great difficulty there were established organs of a local,\r\nautonomous administration, volost and district zemstvos, which were to\r\nfurnish a basis of organization to the government zemstvos. The zemstvo of\r\nformer times was made up of only class representatives; _the elections to\r\nthe new zemstvos were effected by universal suffrage, equal, direct, and\r\nsecret_. These elections were a kind of schooling for the population,\r\nshowing it the practical significance of universal suffrage, and preparing\r\nit for the elections to the Constituent Assembly. At the same time they\r\nlaid the foundation of a local autonomous administration.\r\n\r\n2. Preparations for the election to the Constituent Assembly were made; an\r\nagitation, an intense propaganda followed; preparations of a technical\r\norder were made. This was a difficult task because of the great number of\r\nelectors, the dispersion of the population, the great number of illiterate,\r\netc. Everywhere special courts had been established, in view of the\r\nelections, to train agitators and instructors, who afterward were sent in\r\ngreat numbers into the country.\r\n\r\n3. _At the same time the ground was hurriedly prepared for the law\r\nconcerning the socialization of the soil._ The abandonment of his post by\r\nTchernov, Minister of Agriculture, did not stop this work. The principal\r\nagricultural committee and the Minister of Agriculture, directed by\r\nRakitnikov and Vikhiliaev, hastened to finish this work before the\r\nconvocation of the Constituent Assembly. The Revolutionary Socialist party\r\ndecided to keep for itself the post of Minister of Agriculture; for the\r\nposition they named S. Maslov, who had to exact from the government an\r\nimmediate vote on the law concerning the socialization of the soil. _The\r\nstudy of this law in the Council of Ministers was finished. Nothing more\r\nremained to be done but to adopt and promulgate it. Because of the\r\nexcitement of the people in the country, it was decided to do this at once,\r\nwithout waiting for the Constituent Assembly_. Finally, to better realize\r\nthe conditions of the time, it must be added that the whole country awaited\r\nanxiously the elections to the Constituent Assembly. All believed that this\r\nwas going to settle the life of Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n_The Bolshevist Insurrection_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was under these conditions that the Bolshevist _coup d'état_ happened.\r\nIn the capitals as well as in the provinces, it was accomplished by armed\r\nforce; at Petrograd, with the help of the sailors of the Baltic fleet, of\r\nthe soldiers of the Preobrajenski, Semenovski, and other regiments, in\r\nother towns with the aid of the local garrisons. Here, for example, is how\r\nthe Bolshevist _coup d'état_ took place at Saratov. I was a witness to\r\nthese facts myself. Saratov is a big university and intellectual center,\r\npossessing a great number of schools, libraries, and divers associations\r\ndesigned to elevate the intellectual standard of the population. The\r\nzemstvo of Saratov was one of the best in Russia. The peasant population of\r\nthis province, among whom the Revolutionary Socialist propaganda was\r\ncarried on for several years by the Revolutionary Socialist Party, is wide\r\nawake and well organized. The municipality and the agricultural committees\r\nwere composed of Socialists. The population was actively preparing for the\r\nelections to the Constituent Assembly; the people discussed the list of\r\ncandidates, studied the candidates' biographies, as well as the programs of\r\nthe different parties.\r\n\r\nOn the night of October 28th, by reason of an order that had come from\r\nPetrograd, the Bolshevik _coup d'état_ broke out at Saratov. The following\r\nforces were its instruments: the garrison which was a stranger to the\r\nmasses of the population, a weak party of workers, and, in the capacity of\r\nleaders, some Intellectuals who, up to that time, had played no rôle in the\r\npublic life of the town.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a military _coup d'état_. The city hall, where sat the\r\nSocialists, who were elected by equal, direct, and secret universal\r\nsuffrage, was surrounded by the soldiers; machine-guns were placed in front\r\nand the bombardment began. This lasted a whole night; some were wounded,\r\nsome killed. The municipal judges were arrested. Soon after a Manifesto\r\nsolemnly announced to the population that the \"enemies of the people,\" the\r\n\"counter-revolutionaries,\" were overthrown; that the power at Saratov was\r\ngoing to pass into the hands of the Soviet (Bolshevist) of the Workmen's\r\nand Soldiers' Delegates.\r\n\r\nThe population was perplexed; the people thought that they had sent to the\r\nTown Hall Socialists, men of their choice. Now these men were declared\r\n\"enemies of the people,\" were shot down or arrested by other Socialists.\r\nWhat did all this mean? And the inhabitant of Saratov felt a fear stealing\r\ninto his soul at the sight of this violence; he began to doubt the value of\r\nthe Socialist idea in general. The faith of former times gave place to\r\ndoubt, disappointment, and discouragement. The _coup d'état_ was followed\r\nby divers other manifestations of Bolshevist activity--arrests, searches,\r\nconfiscation of newspapers, ban on meetings. Bands of soldiers looted the\r\ncountry houses in the suburbs of the city; a school for the children of the\r\npeople and the buildings of the children's holiday settlement were also\r\npillaged. Bands of soldiers were forthwith sent into the country to cause\r\ntrouble there.\r\n\r\n_The sensible part of the population of Saratov severely condemned these\r\nacts_ in a series of Manifestos signed by the Printers' Union, the mill\r\nworkers, the City Employees' Union, Postal and Telegraph Employees,\r\nstudents' organizations, and many other democratic associations and\r\norganizations.\r\n\r\nThe peasants received the _coup d'état_ with distinct hostility. Meetings\r\nand reunions were soon organized in the villages. Resolutions were voted\r\ncensuring the _coup d'état_ of violence, deciding to organize to resist the\r\nBolsheviki, and demanding the removal of the Bolshevist soldier members\r\nfrom the rural communes. The bands of soldiers, who were sent into the\r\ncountry, used not only persuasion, but also violence, trying to force the\r\npeasants to give their votes for the Bolshevik candidates at the time of\r\nthe elections to the Constituent Assembly; they tore up the bulletins of\r\nthe Socialist-Revolutionists, overturned the ballot-boxes, etc.\r\n\r\nBut the Bolshevik soldiers were not able to disturb the confidence of the\r\npeasants in the Constituent Assembly, and in the Revolutionary Socialist\r\nparty, whose program they had long since adopted, and whose leaders and\r\nways of acting they knew, the inhabitants of the country proved themselves\r\nin all that concerned the elections wide awake to the highest degree. There\r\nwere hardly any abstentions, _90 per cent. of the population took part in\r\nthe voting_. The day of the voting was kept as a solemn feast; the priest\r\nsaid mass; the peasants dressed in their Sunday clothes; they believed that\r\nthe Constituent Assembly would give them order, laws, the land. In the\r\ngovernment of Saratov, out of fourteen deputies elected, there were twelve\r\nSocialist-Revolutionists; there were others (such as the government of\r\nPensa, for example) that elected _only_ Socialist-Revolutionists. The\r\nBolsheviki had the majority only in Petrograd and Moscow and in certain\r\nunits of the army. The elections to the Constituent Assembly were a\r\ndecisive victory for the Revolutionary Socialist party.\r\n\r\nSuch was the response of Russia to the Bolshevik _coup d'état_. To violence\r\nand conquest of power by force of arms, the population answered by the\r\nelections to the Constituent Assembly; the people sent to this\r\nassembly, not the Bolsheviki, but, by an overwhelming majority,\r\nSocialist-Revolutionists.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n_The Fight Against the Bolsheviki_\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the final result of the elections was not established forthwith. In\r\nmany places the elections had to be postponed. The Bolshevik _coup d'état_\r\nhad disorganized life, had upset postal and telegraphic communications, and\r\nhad even destroyed, in certain localities, the electoral mechanism itself\r\nby the arrest of the active workers. The elections which began in the\r\nmiddle of November were not concluded till toward the month of January.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, in the country a fierce battle was raging against the\r\nBolsheviki. It was not, on the part of their adversaries, a fight for\r\npower. If the Socialist-Revolutionists had wished they could have seized\r\nthe power; to do that they had only to follow the example of those who were\r\ncalled \"the Revolutionary Socialists of the Left.\" Not only did they not\r\nfollow their example, but they also excluded them from their midst. A short\r\ntime after the Bolshevik insurrection, when the part taken in this\r\ninsurrection by certain Revolutionary Socialists of the Left was found out,\r\nthe Central Committee of the Revolutionary Socialist party voted to exclude\r\nthem from the party for having violated the party discipline and having\r\nadopted tactics contrary to its principles. This exclusion was confirmed\r\nafterward by the Fourth Congress of the party, which took place in\r\nDecember, 1917.\r\n\r\nSoon after the _coup d'état_ of October the question was among all parties\r\nand all organizations: \"What is to be done? How will the situation be\r\nremedied?\" The remedy included three points. First, creation of a power\r\ncomposed of the representatives of all Socialist organizations, with the\r\n\"Populist-Socialists\" on the extreme right, and with the express condition\r\nthat the principal actors in the Bolshevik _coup d'état_ would not have\r\npart in the Ministry. Second, immediate establishment of the democratic\r\nliberties, which were trampled under foot by the Bolsheviki, without which\r\nany form of Socialism is inconceivable. Third, convocation without delay of\r\nthe Constituent Assembly.\r\n\r\nSuch were the conditions proposed to the Bolsheviki in the name of several\r\nSocialist parties (the Revolutionary Socialist party, the Mensheviki, the\r\nPopulist-Socialists, etc.), and of several democratic organizations\r\n(Railroad Workers' Union, Postal and Telegraphic Employees' Union, etc.).\r\nThe Bolsheviki, at this time, were not sure of being able to hold their\r\nposition; certain Commissaries of the People, soon after they were\r\ninstalled in power, handed in their resignation, being terrified by the\r\ntorrents of blood that were shed at Moscow and by the cruelties which\r\naccompanied the _coup d'état_. The Bolsheviki pretended to accept the\r\npourparlers, but kept them dragging along so as to gain time. In the mean\r\ntime they tried to strengthen themselves in the provinces, where they\r\ngained victories such as that of Saratov; they actively rushed the\r\npourparlers for peace; they had to do it at all cost, even if, in doing it,\r\nthey had to accept the assistance of the traitor and spy, by name Schneur,\r\nfor they had promised peace to the soldiers.\r\n\r\nFor this it sufficed them to have gained some victories in the provinces,\r\nand that the Germans accepted the proposition of pourparlers of peace (\"the\r\nGerman generals came to meet us in gala attire, wearing their ribbons and\r\ndecorations,\" with triumph announced in their appeal to the Russian people\r\nthe representatives of this \"Socialist\" government Schneur & Co.), for this\r\nthe Bolsheviki henceforth refused every compromise and all conference with\r\nthe other parties. For the other parties--those who did not recognize the\r\nBolshevik _coup d'état_ and did not approve of the violence that was\r\nperpetrated--there was only one alternative, the fight.\r\n\r\nIt was the Revolutionary Socialist party and the National Soviet of\r\nPeasants' Delegates that had to bear the brunt of this fight, which was\r\ncarried on under extremely difficult conditions. All the non-Bolshevik\r\nnewspapers were confiscated or prosecuted and deprived of every means of\r\nreaching the provinces; their editors' offices and printing establishments\r\nwere looted. After the creation of the \"Revolutionary Tribunal,\" the\r\nauthors of articles that were not pleasing to the Bolsheviki, as well as\r\nthe directors of the newspapers, were brought to judgment and condemned to\r\nmake amends or go to prison, etc.\r\n\r\nThe premises of numerous organizations were being constantly pillaged; the\r\nRed Guard came there to search, destroying different documents; frequently\r\nobjects which were found on the premises disappeared. Thus were looted the\r\npremises of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Socialist party (27\r\nGalernaia Street), and, several times, the offices of the paper _Dielo\r\nNarvda_ (22 Litcinaia Street), as well as the office of the \"League for the\r\nDefense of the Constituent Assembly,\" the premises of the committees of\r\ndivers sections of the Revolutionary Socialist party, the office of the\r\npaper _Volia Naroda_, etc.\r\n\r\nLeaders of the different parties were arrested. The arrest of the whole\r\nCentral Committee of the Revolutionary Socialist party was to be carried\r\nout as well as the arrest of all the Socialist-Revolutionists, and of all\r\nthe Mensheviki in sight. The Bolshevist press became infuriated, exclaiming\r\nagainst the \"counter-revolution,\" against their \"complicity\" with Kornilov\r\nand Kalodine.\r\n\r\nAll those who did not adhere to the Bolsheviki were indignant at the sight\r\nof the crimes committed, and wished to defend the Constituent Assembly.\r\nKnowingly, and in a premeditated manner, the Bolshevist press excited the\r\nsoldiers and the workmen against all other parties. And then when the\r\nunthinking masses, drunk with flattery and hatred, committed acts of\r\nlynching, the Bolshevist leaders expressed sham regrets! Thus it was after\r\nthe death of Doukhonine, who was cut to pieces by the sailors; and thus it\r\nwas after the dastardly assassination of the Cadets, Shingariev and\r\nKokochkine, after the shootings _en masse_ and the drowning of the\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nIt was under these conditions that the fight was carried on; and the brunt\r\nof it, as I have already stated, was sustained by the Revolutionary\r\nSocialist party and the National Soviet of Peasants' Delegates, and it was\r\nagainst these two that the Bolsheviki were particularly infuriated. \"Now it\r\nis not the Cadets who are dangerous to us,\" said they, \"but the\r\nSocialist-Revolutionists--these traitors, these enemies of the people.\" The\r\nmost sacred names of the Revolution were publicly trampled under foot by\r\nthem. Their cynicism went so far as to accuse Breshkovskaya, \"the\r\nGrandmother of the Russian Revolution,\" of having sold out to the\r\nAmericans. Personally I had the opportunity to hear a Bolshevist orator, a\r\nmember of the Executive Committee of the Soviet of Workmen's and Soldiers'\r\nDelegates, express this infamous calumny at a meeting organized by the\r\nPreobrajenski Regiment. The Bolsheviki tried, by every means, to crush the\r\nparty, to reduce it to a clandestine existence. But the Central Committee\r\ndeclared that it would continue to fight against violence--and that in an\r\nopen manner; it continued to issue a daily paper, only changing its title,\r\nas in the time of Czarism, and thus continued its propaganda in the\r\nfactories, and helped to form public opinion, etc.\r\n\r\nAt the Fourth Congress of the party, which took place in December, the\r\ndelegates from the provinces, where the despotism of the Bolsheviki was\r\nparticularly violent, raised the question of introducing terrorist methods\r\nin the fight against the Bolsheviki. \"From the time that the party is\r\nplaced in a fight under conditions which differ nothing from those of\r\nCzarism, ancient methods are to be resumed; violence must be opposed to\r\nviolence,\" they said. But the Congress spurned this means; the\r\nRevolutionary Socialist party did not adopt the methods of terrorism; it\r\ncould not do it, because the Bolsheviki were, after all, followed by the\r\nmasses--unthinking, it is true, but the masses, nevertheless. It is by\r\neducating them, and not by the use of violence, that they are to be fought\r\nagainst. Terrorist acts could bring nothing but a bloody suppression.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n_The Second Peasant Congress_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the space of a month a great amount of work was accomplished. A breach\r\nwas made in the general misunderstanding. Moral help was assured to the\r\nConstituent Assembly on the part of the workmen and part of the soldiers of\r\nPetrograd. There was no longer any confidence placed in the Bolsheviki.\r\nBesides, the agitation was not the only cause of this change. The workers\r\nsoon came to understand that the Bolshevik tactics could only irritate and\r\ndisgust the great mass of the population, that the Bolsheviki were not the\r\nrepresentatives of the workers, that their promises of land, of peace, and\r\nother earthly goods were only a snare. The industrial production diminished\r\nmore and more; numerous factories and shops closed their doors and\r\nthousands of workmen found themselves on the streets. The population of\r\nPetrograd, which, at first, received a quarter of a pound of bread per day\r\n(a black bread made with straw), had now but one-eighth of a pound, while\r\nin the time of Kerensky the ration was half a pound. The other products\r\n(oatmeal, butter, eggs, milk) were entirely lacking or cost extremely high\r\nprices. One ruble fifty copecks for a pound of potatoes, six rubles a\r\npound of meat, etc. The transportation of products to Petrograd had almost\r\nceased. The city was on the eve of famine.\r\n\r\nThe workers were irritated by the violence and the arbitrary manner of the\r\nBolsheviki, and by the exploits of the Red Guard, well paid, enjoying all\r\nthe privileges, well nourished, well clothed, and well shod in the midst of\r\na Petrograd starving and in rags.\r\n\r\nDiscontent manifested itself also among the soldiers of the Preobrajenski\r\nand Litovsky regiments, and others. In this manner in the day of the\r\nmeeting of the Constituent Assembly they were no longer very numerous. What\r\nloud cries, nevertheless, they had sent forth lately when Kerensky wished\r\nto send the Preobrajenski and Seminovski regiments from Petrograd! \"What?\r\nSend the revolutionary regiments from Petrograd? To make easier the\r\nsurrender of the capital to the counter-revolution?\" The soldiers of the\r\nPreobrajenski Regiment organized in their barracks frequent meetings, where\r\nthe acts of the Bolsheviki were sharply criticized; they started a paper,\r\n_The Soldiers' Cloak_, which was confiscated.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, here is one of the resolutions voted by the workers of\r\nthe Putilov factory:\r\n\r\n    The Constituent Assembly is the only organ expressing the will of\r\n    the entire people. It alone is able to reconstitute the unity of\r\n    the country.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the deputies to the Constituent Assembly who had for some\r\ntime been elected had arrived in Petrograd, and the Bolsheviki always\r\nretarded the opening. The Socialist-Revolutionist fraction started\r\nconferences with the other fractions on the necessity for fixing a day for\r\nthe opening of the Constituante, without waiting the good pleasure of the\r\nCommissaries of the People. They chose the date, December 27th, but the\r\nopening could not take place on that day, the Ukrainian fraction having\r\nsuddenly abandoned the majority to join themselves to the Bolsheviki and\r\nthe Revolutionary Socialists of the Left. Finally, the government fixed the\r\nopening of the Constituent Assembly for the 5th (18th) of January.\r\n\r\nHere is a document which relates this fight for the date of the opening of\r\nthe Constituante:\r\n\r\n    _Bulletin of Members of the Constituent Assembly Belonging to the\r\n    Socialist-Revolutionist Fraction. No. 5, Dec. 31, 1917._\r\n\r\n    _To All the Citizens_:\r\n\r\n    The Socialist-Revolutionist fraction of the Constituent Assembly\r\n    addresses the whole people the present exposé of the reasons for\r\n    which the Constituent Assembly has not been opened until this day:\r\n    it warns them, at the same time, of the danger which threatens the\r\n    sovereign rights of the people.\r\n\r\n    Let it be thus placed in clear daylight, the true character of\r\n    those who, under pretext of following the well-being of the\r\n    workers, forge new chains for liberated Russia, those who attempt\r\n    to assassinate the Constituent Assembly, which alone is able to\r\n    save Russia from the foreign yoke and from the despotism which has\r\n    been born within.\r\n\r\n    Let all the citizens know that the hour is near when they must be\r\n    ready to rise like one man for the defense of their liberty and\r\n    their Constituent Assembly.\r\n\r\n    For, citizens, your salvation is solely in your own hands.\r\n\r\n    Citizens! you know that on the day assigned for the opening of the\r\n    Constituent Assembly, November 28th, all the\r\n    Socialist-Revolutionist deputies who were elected had come to\r\n    Petrograd. You know that neither violence of a usurping power nor\r\n    arrests of our comrades, by force of arms which were opposed to us\r\n    at the Taurida Palace, could prevent us from assembling and\r\n    fulfilling our duty.\r\n\r\n    But the civil war which has spread throughout the country retarded\r\n    the election to the Constituent Assembly and the number of\r\n    deputies elected was insufficient.\r\n\r\n    It was necessary to postpone the opening of the Constituent\r\n    Assembly.\r\n\r\n    Our fraction utilized this forced delay by an intensive\r\n    preparatory work. We elaborated, in several commissions, projects\r\n    of law concerning all the fundamental questions that the\r\n    Constituante would have to solve. We adopted the project of our\r\n    fundamental law on the question of the land; we elaborated the\r\n    measures which the Constituante would have to take from the very\r\n    first day in order to arrive at a truly democratic peace, so\r\n    necessary to our country; we discussed the principles which should\r\n    direct the friendly dwelling together of all the nationalities\r\n    which people Russia and assure each people a national point of\r\n    view, the free disposition of itself, thus putting an end to the\r\n    fratricidal war.\r\n\r\n    Our fraction would have been all ready for the day of the opening\r\n    of the Constituante, in order to commence, from the first, a\r\n    creative work and give to the impoverished country peace, bread,\r\n    land, and liberty.\r\n\r\n    At the same time, we did our utmost to accelerate the arrival of\r\n    the deputies and the opening of the Assembly.\r\n\r\n    During this time events became more and more menacing every day,\r\n    the Bolshevik power was more rapidly leading our country to its\r\n    fall. From before the time when the Germans had presented their\r\n    conditions of peace the Bolsheviki had destroyed the army,\r\n    suppressed its provisioning, and stripped the front, while at the\r\n    same time by civil war and the looting of the savings of the\r\n    people they achieved the economic ruin of the country. Actually,\r\n    they recognized themselves that the German conditions were\r\n    unacceptable and invited the reconstruction of the army. In spite\r\n    of this, these criminals do not retire; they will achieve their\r\n    criminal work.\r\n\r\n    Russia suffers in the midst of famine, of civil war, and enemy\r\n    invasion which threatens to reach even the heart of the country.\r\n\r\n    No delay is permissible.\r\n\r\n    Our fraction fixed on the 27th of December the last delay for the\r\n    opening of the Constituante; on this day more than half of the\r\n    deputies could have arrived in Petrograd. We entered into\r\n    conference with the other fractions. The Ukrainians, some other\r\n    national fractions, and the Menshevik Social Democrats adhered to\r\n    our resolution. The Revolutionary Socialists of the Left\r\n    hypocritically declared themselves partizans of an early opening\r\n    of the Constituante. But behold, the Council of the so-called\r\n    \"Commissaries of the People\" fixed the opening for the 5th of\r\n    January. _At the same time they called for the 8th of January a\r\n    Congress of the Soviets of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates,\r\n    thus hoping to be able to trick and to cover with the name of this\r\n    Congress their criminal acts_. The object of this postponement is\r\n    clear; they did not even hide it and threatened to dissolve the\r\n    Constituent Assembly in case that it did not submit to the\r\n    Bolshevik Congress of Soviets. The same threat was repeated by\r\n    those who are called Socialist-Revolutionists of the Left.\r\n\r\n    The delegation of the Ukrainian Revolutionary Socialists abandoned\r\n    us also and submitted to the order for the convocation on January\r\n    5th, considering that the fight of the Bolshevik power against the\r\n    Constituent Assembly is an internal question, which interests only\r\n    Greater Russia.\r\n\r\n    Citizens! We shall be there, too, on January 5th, so that the\r\n    least particle of responsibility for the sabotage of the\r\n    Constituent Assembly may not fall upon us.\r\n\r\n    But we do not think that we can suspend our activity with regard\r\n    to the speediest possible opening of the Constituent Assembly.\r\n\r\n    We address an energetic appeal to all the deputies; in the name of\r\n    the fatherland, in the name of the Revolution, in the name of the\r\n    duty which devolves upon you by reason of your election, come,\r\n    all, to Petrograd! On the 1st of January all the deputies present\r\n    will decide on the day for the opening of the Constituent\r\n    Assembly.\r\n\r\n    We appeal to you, citizens! Remind your elected representatives of\r\n    their duty.\r\n\r\n    And remember that your salvation is solely in your own hands, a\r\n    mortal danger threatens the Constituent Assembly; be all ready to\r\n    rise in its defense!\r\n\r\n    THE REVOLUTIONARY SOCIALIST FRACTION OF THE CONSTITUENT\r\n    ASSEMBLY.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of January the League for the Defense of the Constituent Assembly\r\nheld a meeting at which were present 210 delegates, representing the\r\nSocialist parties as well as various democratic organizations and many\r\nfactories--that of Putilov, that of Oboukhov, and still others from the\r\noutskirts of Narva, from the districts of Viborg, Spassky, and\r\nPetrogradsky, from the Isle Vassily. It was decided to organize for January\r\n5th a peaceful display in honor of the opening of the Constituent\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\nThe Bolsheviki answered this by furious articles in the _Pravda_, urging\r\nthe people not to spare the counter-revolutionaries, these bourgeoisie who\r\nintend, by means of their Constituante, to combat the revolutionary people.\r\nThey advised the people of Petrograd not to go out on the streets that day.\r\n\"We shall act without reserve,\" they added.\r\n\r\nSailors were called from Cronstadt; cruisers and torpedo-boats came. An\r\norder was issued to the sailors and to the Red Guards who patrolled all the\r\nworks of the Taurida, to make use of their arms if any one attempted to\r\nenter the palace. For that day unlimited powers were accorded to the\r\nmilitary authorities. At the same time an assembly of the representatives\r\nof the garrison at Petrograd, fixed for that day, was proscribed, and the\r\nnewspaper, _The Soldiers' Cloak_, was suppressed.\r\n\r\nA Congress of Soviets was called for the 8th of January. They prepared the\r\ndissolution of the Constituent Assembly and they wanted to place the\r\nCongress before the accomplished fact. The Executive Committee of the\r\nSoviet of Peasants' Delegates, and the Central Executive Committee of the\r\nSoviets of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates chosen at the first elections\r\nanswered by the two following appeals:\r\n\r\n    Peasant Comrades!\r\n\r\n    The Bolsheviki have fixed the 5th of January for the opening of\r\n    the Constituent Assembly; for the 8th of January they call the III\r\n    Congress of the Soviets of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates, and\r\n    for the 13th the Peasant Congress.\r\n\r\n    The peasants are, by design, relegated to the background.\r\n\r\n    An outrage against the Constituent Assembly is being prepared.\r\n\r\n    In this historic moment the peasants cannot remain aloof.\r\n\r\n    The Provisional Executive Committee of the National Soviet of\r\n    Peasants' Delegates, which goes on duty as a guard to the\r\n    Constituent Assembly, has decided to call, on the 8th of January,\r\n    also, the Third National Congress of the Soviets of Peasants'\r\n    Delegates. The representation remains the same as before. Send\r\n    your delegates at once to Petrograd, Grand Bolotnai, 2A.\r\n\r\n    The fate of the Constituent Assembly is the fate of Russia, the\r\n    fate of the Revolution.\r\n\r\n    All up for the defense of the Constituent Assembly, for the\r\n    defense of the Revolution--not by word alone, but by acts!\r\n\r\n    [Signed] _The Provisional Executive Committee of the National\r\n    Soviet of Peasants' Delegates, upholding the principle of the\r\n    defense of the Constituent Assembly_.\r\n\r\n    APPEAL OF THE CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE SOVIETS OF\r\n    WORKMEN'S AND SOLDIERS' DELEGATES, CHOSEN AT THE FIRST\r\n    ELECTIONS\r\n\r\n    To all the Soviets of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates, to all\r\n    the Committees of the Army and of the Navy, to all the\r\n    organizations associated with the Soviets and Committees, to all\r\n    the members of the Socialist-Revolutionist and Menshevist Social\r\n    Democratic fractions who left the Second Congress of Soviets:\r\n\r\n    Comrades, workmen, and soldiers! Our cry of alarm is addressed to\r\n    all those to whom the work of the Soviets is dear. Know that a\r\n    traitorous blow threatens the revolutionary fatherland, the\r\n    Constituent Assembly, and even the work of the Soviets. Your duty\r\n    is to prepare yourselves for their defense.\r\n\r\n    The Central Executive Committee, nominated at the October\r\n    Congress, calls together for the 8th of January a Congress of\r\n    Soviets, destined to bungle the Constituent Assembly.\r\n\r\n    Comrades! The Second Congress of Soviets assembled at the end of\r\n    October, under conditions particularly unfavorable, at the time\r\n    that the Bolshevik party, won over by its leaders to a policy of\r\n    adventure, a plot unbecoming a class organization, executed at\r\n    Petrograd a _coup d'état_ which gave it power; at a time when\r\n    certain groups with the same viewpoint disorganized even the\r\n    method of convocation of the Second Congress, thus openly aspiring\r\n    to falsify the results; at this same Congress the regular\r\n    representatives of the army were lacking (only two armies being\r\n    represented), and the Soviets of the provinces were very\r\n    insufficiently represented (only about 120 out of 900). Under\r\n    these conditions it is but natural that the Central Executive\r\n    Committee of the Soviets chosen at the first election would not\r\n    recognize the right of this Congress to decide the politics of the\r\n    Soviets.\r\n\r\n    However, in spite of the protestations, and even of the departure\r\n    of a great number of delegates (those of the Revolutionary\r\n    Socialist fraction, Mensheviki, and Populist-Socialists), a new\r\n    Executive Committee of the Soviets was elected. To consider this\r\n    last as the central director of all the Soviets of the country was\r\n    absolutely impossible. The delegates who remained in the Congress\r\n    formed only an assembly of a group with a little fraction of the\r\n    Revolutionary Socialists of the Left, who had given their adhesion\r\n    to them. Thus the Central Committee named by their Conference\r\n    could not be considered except as representatives of these two\r\n    groups only.\r\n\r\n    Bringing to the organization of Soviets an unheard-of disorder,\r\n    establishing by their shameful methods of fighting its domination\r\n    over the Soviets, some of which were taken by surprise, the others\r\n    terrorized and broken in their personnel, deceiving the working\r\n    class and the army by its short-sighted policy of adventure, the\r\n    new Executive Committee during the two months that have since\r\n    passed has attempted to subject all the Soviets of Russia to its\r\n    influence. It succeeded in part in this, in the measure in which\r\n    the confidence of the groups which constituted it in the policy\r\n    was not yet exhausted. But a considerable portion of the Soviets,\r\n    as well as fractions of other Soviets, fractions composed of the\r\n    most devoted and experienced fighters, continued to follow the\r\n    only true revolutionary road; to develop the class organization of\r\n    the working masses, to direct their intellectual and political\r\n    life, to develop the political and social aspects of the\r\n    Revolution, to exert, by all the power of the working class\r\n    organized into Soviets, the necessary pressure to attain the end\r\n    that it proposed. The questions of peace and of war, that of the\r\n    organization of production and of food-supply, and that of the\r\n    fight for the Constituent Assembly are in the first place. The\r\n    policy of adventure of the groups which seized the power is on the\r\n    eve of failure. Peace could not be realized by a rupture with the\r\n    Allies and an entente with the imperialistic orb of the Central\r\n    Powers. By reason of this failure of the policy of the\r\n    Commissaires of the People, of the disorganization of production\r\n    (which, among other things, has had as a result the creation of\r\n    hundreds of thousands of unemployed), by reason of the civil war\r\n    kindled in the country and the absence of a power recognized by\r\n    the whole people, the Central Powers tend to take hold in the most\r\n    cynical fashion of a whole series of western provinces (Poland,\r\n    Lithuania, Courland), and to subject the whole country to their\r\n    complete economic, if not political, domination.\r\n\r\n    The question of provisioning has taken on an unheard-of acuteness;\r\n    the gross interference in the functioning of organs already\r\n    created for this object, and the civil war kindled everywhere\r\n    throughout the country, have completely demoralized the\r\n    provisioning of wheat in regions where they had none, the north\r\n    and the army are found on the eve of famine.\r\n\r\n    Industry is dying. Hundreds of factories and workshops are\r\n    stopped. The short-sighted policy of the Commissaries has caused\r\n    hundreds of workmen to be thrown on the streets and become\r\n    unemployed. The will of the entire people is threatened with being\r\n    violated. The usurpers who in October got hold of the power by\r\n    launching the word of order for a swift convocation of the\r\n    Constituent Assembly strive hard, now that the elections are over,\r\n    to retain the power in their hands by arresting the deputies and\r\n    dissolving the Constituante itself.\r\n\r\n    _All that which the country holds of life, and in the first place\r\n    all the working class and all the army, ought to rise with arms in\r\n    their hands to defend the popular power represented by the\r\n    Constituante, which must bring peace to the people and consolidate\r\n    by legislative means the revolutionary conquests of the working\r\n    class._\r\n\r\n    In bringing this to your knowledge, the Central Committee chosen\r\n    at the first elections invites you, Comrades, to place yourself\r\n    immediately in agreement with it.\r\n\r\n    Considering the Congress of October as incompetent, the Central\r\n    Committee chosen at the first elections has decided to begin a\r\n    preparatory work in view of the convocation of a new Congress of\r\n    the Soviets of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates.\r\n\r\n    In the near future, while the Commissaires of the People, in the\r\n    persons of Lenine and Trotzky, are going to fight against the\r\n    sovereign power of the Constituent Assembly, we shall have to\r\n    intervene with all our energy in the conflict artificially encited\r\n    by the adventurers, between that Assembly and the Soviets. _It\r\n    will be our task to aid the Soviets in taking consciousness of\r\n    their rôle, in defining their political lines, and in determining\r\n    their functions and those of the Constituante._\r\n\r\n    Comrades! The convocation of the Congress for the 8th of January\r\n    is dictated by the desire to provoke a conflict between the\r\n    Soviets and the Constituante, and thus botch this last. Anxious\r\n    for the fate of the country, the Executive Committee chosen at the\r\n    first elections decides to convoke at Petrograd for the 8th of\r\n    January an extraordinary assembly of _all the Soviets, all the\r\n    Committees of the Army and the Navy, all the fractions of the\r\n    Soviets and military committees, all the organizations that\r\n    cluster around the Soviets and the Committees that are standing\r\n    upon the ground of the defense of the Constituante._ The following\r\n    are the Orders of the Day:\r\n\r\n    1. The power of the Constituent Assembly.\r\n    2. The fight for the general democratic peace and the re-establishment\r\n    of the International.\r\n    3. The immediate problems of the policy of the Soviets.\r\n\r\n    Comrades! Assure for this extraordinary assembly of Soviets the\r\n    most complete representation of all the organizations of workmen\r\n    and soldiers. Establish at once election centers. We have a fight\r\n    to uphold.\r\n\r\n    In the name of the Revolution, all the reason and all the energy\r\n    ought to be thrown into the balance.\r\n\r\n    THE CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF SOVIETS OF WORKMEN'S AND\r\n    SOLDIERS' DELEGATES CHOSEN AT THE FIRST ELECTIONS.\r\n\r\n    _25 December, 1917._\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n_The Manifestation of January 5th at Petrograd_\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom eleven o'clock in the morning cortèges, composed principally of\r\nworking-men bearing red flags and placards with inscriptions such as\r\n\"Proletarians of All Countries, Unite!\" \"Land and Liberty!\" \"Long Live the\r\nConstituent Assembly!\" etc., set out from different parts of the city. The\r\nmembers of the Executive Committee of the Soviet of Peasants' Delegates\r\nhad agreed to meet at the Field, of Mars where a procession coming from the\r\nPetrogradsky quarter was due to arrive. It was soon learned that a part of\r\nthe participants, coming from the Viborg quarter, had been assailed at the\r\nLiteiny bridge by gunfire from the Red Guards and were obliged to turn\r\nback. But that did not check the other parades. The peasant participants,\r\nunited with the workers from Petrogradsky quarter, came to the Field of\r\nMars; after having lowered their flags before the tombs of the Revolution\r\nof February and sung a funeral hymn to their memory, they installed\r\nthemselves on Liteinaia Street. New manifestants came to join them and the\r\nstreet was crowded with people. At the corner of Fourstatskaia Street (one\r\nof the Streets leading to the Taurida Palace) they found themselves all at\r\nonce assailed by shots from the Red Guards.\r\n\r\nThe Red Guard fired _without warning_, something that never before\r\nhappened, even in the time of Czarism. The police always began by inviting\r\nthe participators to disperse. Among the first victims was a member of the\r\nExecutive Committee of the Soviet of Peasants' Delegates, the Siberian\r\npeasant, Logvinov. An explosive bullet shot away half of his head (a\r\nphotograph of his body was taken; it was added to the documents which were\r\ntransferred to the Commission of Inquiry). Several workmen and students and\r\none militant of the Revolutionary Socialist party, Gorbatchevskaia, were\r\nkilled at the same time. Other processions of participants on their way to\r\nthe Taurida Palace were fired into at the same time. On all the streets\r\nleading to the palace, groups of Red Guards had been established; they\r\nreceived the order \"Not to spare the cartridges.\" On that day at Petrograd\r\nthere were one hundred killed and wounded.\r\n\r\nIt must be noted that when, at a session of the Constituent Assembly, in\r\nthe Taurida Palace, they learned of this shooting, M. Steinberg,\r\nCommissioner of Justice, declared in the corridor that it was a lie, that\r\nhe himself had visited the streets of Petrograd and had found everywhere\r\nthat \"all was quiet.\" Exactly as the Ministers of Nicholas Romanov after\r\nthe suppressions said \"Lie. Lie,\" so cried the Bolsheviki and the\r\nRevolutionary Socialists of the Left, in response to the question formally\r\nput on the subject of the shooting by a member of the Constituent Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe following day the Bolshevik organs and those of the Revolutionary\r\nSocialists of the Left passed over these facts in silence. This silence\r\nthey kept also on the 9th of January, the day on which literally all\r\nPetrograd assembled at the funeral of the victims. Public indignation,\r\nhowever, obliged them in the end to admit that there had been some small\r\ngroups of participants and to name a Commission of Inquiry concerning the\r\nstreet disorders which had taken place on January 5th. This Commission was\r\nvery dilatory in the performance of its duty and it is very doubtful if\r\nthey ever came to any decision.\r\n\r\nAnalogous manifestations took place at Moscow, at Saratov and other cities;\r\neverywhere they were accompanied by shootings. The number of victims was\r\nparticularly considerable at Moscow.\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n_At the Taurida Palace on the Day of the Opening of the Constituent\r\nAssembly_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Taurida Palace on that day presented a strange aspect. At every door,\r\nin the corridors, in the halls, everywhere soldiers and sailors and Red\r\nGuards armed with guns and hand-grenades, who at every turn demanded your\r\npass. It was no easy matter to get into the palace. Nearly all the places\r\nreserved for the public were occupied by the Bolsheviki and their friends.\r\nThe appearance of the Taurida Palace was not that of a place where the\r\nfree representatives of a free people were going to assemble.\r\n\r\nThe Bolsheviki delayed as much as possible the opening of the session. It\r\nwas only at four o'clock instead of at midday that they deigned to make up\r\ntheir minds. They and the Revolutionary Socialists of the Left occupied\r\nseats of the extreme left; then came the Revolutionary Socialists, the\r\nMensheviki, and the other Socialist fractions. The seats on the right\r\nremained vacant. The few Cadets that had been chosen preferred not to come.\r\nIn this manner the Constituent Assembly was composed at this first and last\r\nsession solely of Socialists. This, however, did not prevent the presence\r\nin the corridors and the session hail of a crowd of sailors and Red Guards\r\narmed, as if it were a question of an assembly of conspirators, enemies of\r\nthe Revolution.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning a fight was started by the election of president. The\r\nmajority nominated for the office of president Chernov; the Bolsheviki and\r\nthe Revolutionary Socialists of the Left voted against him. The Bolsheviki\r\ndid not propose any candidate of their own, and placed before the members\r\nthe candidacy of a Revolutionary Socialist of the Left, Marie Spiridonova,\r\nwho was totally incapable of fulfilling this rôle. Afterward several\r\ndeclarations were read--that of the Bolsheviki, that of the\r\nSocialist-Revolutionists (read by Chernov), that of the Mensheviki (read by\r\nTseretelli). The partizans of each fraction greeted the reading of their\r\nown declaration with deafening applause (for the audience was one of\r\n\"comrades\" and did not hesitate to take part in the debates); cat-calls and\r\nshouts greeted the orators of the opposing fractions. Each word of the\r\ndeclarations of the Socialist-Revolutionists and of the Mensheviki\r\n(declarations which every Socialist could sign) was received with a round\r\nof hisses, shouts, deafening cries, exclamations of contempt for the\r\nBolsheviki, the sailors, and the soldiers. The speech of Chernov--president\r\nand member of a detested party--had above all the honor of such a\r\ngreeting. As for Tseretelli, he was at first greeted by an inconceivable\r\ndin, but was able afterward--his speech was so full of profound sense--to\r\ncapture the attention of the Bolsheviki themselves.\r\n\r\nA general impression that was extremely distressing came from this historic\r\nsession. The attitude of the Bolsheviki was grossly unbecoming and\r\nprovocative of disdain. It indicated clearly that the dissolution of the\r\nConstituante was, for them, already decided. Lenine, who continually kept\r\ncontemptuous silence, wound up by stretching himself upon his bench and\r\npretending to sleep. Lunotcharsky from his ministerial bench pointed\r\ncontemptuously with his finger toward the white hair of a veteran of the\r\nRevolutionary Socialist party. The sailors leveled the muzzles of their\r\nrevolvers at the Socialist-Revolutionists. The audience laughed, whistled,\r\nand shouted.\r\n\r\nThe Bolsheviki finally left the Assembly, followed, as might be understood,\r\nby their servants, the Revolutionary Socialists of the Left. The fractions\r\nwhich remained voted the law proposed by the Socialist-Revolutionists on\r\nthe transfer of the lands to common ownership (socialization of the soil).\r\nThe sailors and Red Guards attempted several times to interrupt the\r\nsession. At five o'clock in the morning they finally demanded with a loud\r\nvoice that everybody leave.\r\n\r\n\"We were obliged to go,\" said, later, the members of the Constituent\r\nAssembly at a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Soviet of Peasants'\r\nDelegates in recounting these tragic moments, \"not that we were afraid of\r\nbeing shot; we were prepared for that, and each one of us expected it, but\r\nfear of something else which is far worse: for fear of insults and gross\r\nviolence. We were only a handful; what was that beside those great big\r\nfellows full of malice toward the Constituante and of defiance for the\r\n'enemies of the people,' the 'servants of the bourgeoisie,' which we were\r\nin their eyes, thanks to the lies and the calumnies of the Bolsheviki?\r\nCareful of our dignity, and out of respect for the place where we were, we\r\ncould not permit ourselves to be cuffed, nor that they throw us out of the\r\nTaurida Palace by force--and that is what would have inevitably happened.\"\r\n\r\nIt was thus that the Constituent Assembly ended. The\r\nSocialist-Revolutionist fraction maintained an attitude of surprising calm\r\nand respectful bearing, not allowing itself to be disturbed by any\r\nprovocation. The correspondents of foreign newspapers congratulated the\r\nmembers and said to them that in this session to which the Bolsheviki had\r\nwished to give the character of \"any-old-kind-of-a-meeting\" all the\r\nfractions maintained a truly parliamentary attitude.\r\n\r\nThe Bolshevik terror became rife. _All the newspapers that tried to open\r\nthe eyes of the people as to what was happening were confiscated_. Every\r\nattempt to circulate the _Dielo Naroda_ or other newspapers of the\r\nopposition was severely punished. The volunteer venders of these papers\r\nwere arrested, cruelly struck down by rifle butts, and sometimes even shot.\r\nThe population, indignant, gathered in groups on the streets, but the Red\r\nGuards dispersed all assemblages.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n_The Dissolution of the Third All-Russian Peasants' Congress_\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the course of the events which followed the dissolution of the\r\nConstituante. On the 8th of January the members of the Constituante\r\nassembled at Bolotnaia; two were arrested; the premises of the fraction\r\nwere occupied by the Red Guards. On the 9th of January took place the\r\nfuneral of the victims, in which all Petrograd took part. The Bolsheviki\r\nthis time did not dare to shoot into the magnificent procession preceded by\r\na long line of coffins. The 10th of January they dispersed the Third\r\nAll-Russian Congress of Peasants which had placed itself on the side of the\r\nConstituent Assembly. The Congress had been at first arranged for the 8th\r\nof January (the same day as the Bolshevik Congress of the Soviets), but,\r\nbecause of the events, it was postponed to the 10th. The peasants who had\r\ncome to this Congress knew perfectly well that they would have a fight to\r\nuphold, perhaps even to give their lives. Their neighbors, their\r\nco-villagers, wept when they saw them set out, as if it were a question of\r\nmen condemned to death. That alone suffices to show to what degree were\r\nconscious these peasants who had come from all corners of the country to\r\nprepare themselves for the defense of the Constituent Assembly.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Congress was opened sailors and Red Guards, armed with guns\r\nand hand-grenades, broke into the premises (11 Kirillovskaia Street),\r\nsurrounded the house, poured into the corridors and the session hall, and\r\nordered all persons to leave.\r\n\r\n\"In whose name do you order us, who are Delegates to the Peasants' Congress\r\nof All-Russia, to disperse?\" asked the peasants.\r\n\r\n\"In the name of the Baltic fleet,\" the soldiers replied.\r\n\r\nThe peasants refused; cries of protest were raised. One by one the peasant\r\ndelegates ascended the tribune to stigmatize the Bolsheviki in speeches\r\nfull of indignation, and to express the hopes that they placed in the\r\nConstituent Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe sailors listened. They had come to disperse a counter-revolutionary\r\nCongress, and these speeches troubled them. One sailor, not able to stand\r\nit any longer, burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\"Let me speak!\" he shouted to the president. \"I hear your speeches, peasant\r\ncomrades, and I no longer understand anything.... What is going on? We are\r\npeasants, and you, too, are peasants. But we are of this side, and you are\r\nof the other.... Why? Who has separated us? For we are brothers.... But it\r\nis as if a barrier had been placed between us.\" He wept and, seizing his\r\nrevolver, he exclaimed, \"No, I would rather kill myself!\"\r\n\r\nThis session of the Congress presented a strange spectacle, disturbed by\r\nmen who confessed that they did not know why they were there; the peasants\r\nsang revolutionary songs; the sailors, armed with guns and grenades, joined\r\nthem. Then the peasants knelt down to sing a funeral hymn to the memory of\r\nLogvinov, whose coffin was even yesterday within the room. The soldiers,\r\nlowering their guns, knelt down also.\r\n\r\nThe Bolshevik authorities became excited; they did not expect such a turn\r\nto events. \"Enough said,\" declared the chief; \"we have come not to speak,\r\nbut to act. If they do not want to go to Smolny, let them get out of here.\"\r\nAnd they set themselves to the task.\r\n\r\nIn groups of five the peasants were conducted down-stairs, trampled on,\r\nand, on their refusal to go to Smolny, pushed out of doors during the night\r\nin the midst of the enormous city of which they knew nothing.\r\n\r\nMembers of the Executive Committee were arrested, the premises occupied by\r\nsailors and Red Guards, the objects found therein stolen.\r\n\r\nThe peasants found shelter in the homes of the inhabitants of Petrograd,\r\nwho, indignant, offered them hospitality; a certain number were lodged in\r\nthe barracks of the Preobrajenski Regiment. The sailors, who but a few\r\nminutes before had sung a funeral hymn to Logvinov, and wept when they saw\r\nthat they understood nothing, now became the docile executors of the orders\r\nof the Bolsheviki. And when they were asked, \"Why do you do this?\" they\r\nanswered as in the time, still recent, of Czarism: \"It is the order. No\r\nneed to talk.\"\r\n\r\nIt was thus there was manifested the habit of servile obedience, of\r\narbitrary power and violence, which had been taking root for several\r\ncenturies; under a thin veneer of revolution one finds the servile and\r\nviolent man of yesterday.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these exceptional circumstances the peasants gave proof of\r\nthat obstinacy and energy in the pursuit of their rights for which they are\r\nnoted. Thrown out in the middle of the night, robbed, insulted, they\r\ndecided, nevertheless, to continue their Congress. \"How, otherwise, can we\r\ngo home?\" said they. \"We must come to an understanding as to what is to be\r\ndone.\"\r\n\r\nThe members of the Executive Committee who were still free succeeded in\r\nfinding new premises (let it be noted that among others the workmen of the\r\nbig Oboukhovsky factory offered them hospitality), and during three days\r\nthe peasants could assemble secretly by hiding themselves from the eyes of\r\nthe Red Guard, and the spies in various quarters of Petrograd, until such\r\ntime as the decisions were given on all great questions. _A procès-verbal\r\nwas prepared concerning all that had taken place on Kirillovskaia Street. A\r\ndeclaration was made protesting against the acts of the Bolshevik\r\ngovernment_. This declaration was to be read at the Taurida Palace when the\r\nSoviets were in congress by delegates designated for that purpose. The\r\nBolsheviki, however, would not permit the delegates to enter the Taurida\r\nPalace.\r\n\r\nHere are the texts of the declaration and of the procès-verbal:\r\n\r\n    At the Third National Congress of Soviets of Peasants' Delegates\r\n    grouped around the principle of the defense of the Constituent\r\n    Assembly, this declaration was sent to the Congress of Workmen's,\r\n    Soldiers' and Peasants' Delegates called together by the\r\n    Bolshevist government at the Taurida Palace:\r\n\r\n    At the Second National Peasants' Congress the 359 delegates who\r\n    had come together for the defense of the Constituent Assembly\r\n    continued the work of the Congress and elected a provisional\r\n    Executive Committee, independently of the 354 delegates who had\r\n    opposed the power of the Constituent Assembly and adhered to the\r\n    Bolsheviki.\r\n\r\n    We, peasant delegates, having come to Petrograd, more than 300 in\r\n    number, to participate in a Congress called by the Provisional\r\n    Executive Committee, which is that of those of the Soviets which\r\n    acknowledge the principle of the defense of the Constituent\r\n    Assembly, declare to our electors, to the millions of the peasant\r\n    population, and to the whole country, that the actual government\r\n    which is called \"The Government of the Peasants and Workmen\" has\r\n    established in their integrity the violence, the arbitrariness,\r\n    and all the horrors of the autocratic régime which was overthrown\r\n    by the great Revolution of February. All the liberties attained by\r\n    that Revolution and won by innumerable sacrifices during several\r\n    generations are scouted and trodden under foot. Liberty of opinion\r\n    does not exist; men who under the government of the Czar had paid\r\n    by years of prison and exile for their devotedness to the\r\n    revolutionary cause are now again thrown into the dungeons of\r\n    fortresses without any accusation whatever, of anything of which\r\n    they might be guilty, being made to them. Again spies and\r\n    informers are in action. Again capital punishment is\r\n    re-established in its most horrible forms; shooting on the streets\r\n    and assassinations without judgment or examination. _Peaceful\r\n    processions, on their way to salute the Constituent Assembly, are\r\n    greeted by a fusillade of shots upon the orders of the autocrats\r\n    of Smolny. The liberty of the press does not exist; the papers\r\n    which displease the Bolsheviki are suppressed, their printing\r\n    plants and offices looted, their editors arrested._\r\n\r\n    The organizations which, during the preceding months, were\r\n    established with great difficulty--zemstvos, municipalities,\r\n    agricultural and food committees--are foolishly destroyed in an\r\n    excess of savage fanaticism.\r\n\r\n    The Bolsheviki even try to kill the supreme representation, the\r\n    only one legitimately established, of the popular will--the\r\n    Constituent Assembly.\r\n\r\n    To justify this violence and this tyranny they try to allege the\r\n    well-being of the people, but we, peasant workers, we see well\r\n    that their policy will only tighten the cord around the workers'\r\n    necks, while the possibility of a democratic peace becomes more\r\n    remote every day; matters have come to the point where the\r\n    Bolsheviki proclaim a further mobilization--of salaried\r\n    volunteers, it is true--to renew the hostilities. They strive to\r\n    represent the war with Ukraine and with the Cossacks under the\r\n    aspect of a war of classes; it is not, however, the bourgeoisie,\r\n    but the representatives of the working classes who are killed on\r\n    one side and on the other. They promised the Socialist régime, and\r\n    they have only destroyed the production of the factories so as to\r\n    leave the population without product and throw the workers into an\r\n    army of unemployed; the horrible specter of famine occupies the\r\n    void left by the broken organizations of food-supply; millions of\r\n    the money of the people are squandered in maintaining a Red\r\n    Guard--or sent to Germany to keep up the agitation there, while\r\n    the wives and the widows of our soldiers no longer receive an\r\n    allowance, there being no money in the Treasury, and are obliged\r\n    to live on charity.\r\n\r\n    The Russian country is threatened with ruin. Death knocks at the\r\n    doors of the hovels of the workmen.\r\n\r\n    By what forces have the Bolsheviki thus killed our country? Twelve\r\n    days before the organization of the autonomous administration was\r\n    achieved and the elections to the Constituent Assembly begun, at\r\n    the time when there had been organized all the autonomous\r\n    administrations of volosts, districts, governments, and cities,\r\n    chosen by equal, direct, and secret universal suffrage, thus\r\n    assuring the realization of the will of the people and justifying\r\n    the confidence of the population--even then they seized the power\r\n    and established a régime which subjects all the institutions of\r\n    the country to the unlicensed power of the Commissaries of the\r\n    People. _And these Commissaries rely upon the Soviets, which were\r\n    chosen at elections that were carried out according to rank, with\r\n    open balloting and inequality of vote, for therein the peasants\r\n    count only as many representatives as the workmen of the cities,\r\n    although in Russia their number is sixty times greater_.\r\n\r\n    Absence of control permits every abuse of power; absence of secret\r\n    voting permits that into these Soviets at these suspicious\r\n    elections some enter who are attracted by the political rôle of\r\n    these institutions; the defeat of inequality in the suffrage\r\n    restrains the expression of the will of the peasants, and,\r\n    accordingly, these cannot have confidence in this system of\r\n    government. The tyranny that presided at these elections was such\r\n    that the Bolsheviki themselves pay no attention to the results,\r\n    and declare that the Soviets that are opposed to themselves are\r\n    bourgeoisie and capitalists. We, representing the peasant workers,\r\n    must declare in the name of our constituents: if anything can save\r\n    Russia, it can only be the re-establishment of the organs of\r\n    local autonomous administration, chosen by equal, direct, and\r\n    secret universal suffrage and the resumption, without delay, of\r\n    the work of the Constituent Assembly.\r\n\r\n    The Constituent Assembly alone can express the exact will of the\r\n    working-people, for the system of election which governs it\r\n    includes every measure of precaution against violence, corruption,\r\n    and other abuses, and assures the election of deputies chosen by\r\n    the majority; now, in the country, the majority is composed of the\r\n    working class.\r\n\r\n    Millions of peasants delegated us to defend the Constituante, but\r\n    this was dissolved as soon as it began to work for the good of the\r\n    people. The work of the Constituante was interrupted at the time\r\n    that it was discussing the law concerning land, when a new\r\n    agricultural régime was being elaborated for the country. For this\r\n    reason, and for this alone, the Constituante adopted only the\r\n    first articles of this law, articles which established the\r\n    definite transfer of all the land to the hands of the workers,\r\n    without any ransom. The other articles of this law, which\r\n    concerned the order of the apportionment of lots, its forms, its\r\n    methods of possession, etc., could not be adopted, although they\r\n    were completely elaborated in the commission and nothing remained\r\n    but to sanction them.\r\n\r\n    We, peasants assembled in Congress, we, too, have been the object\r\n    of violence and outrages, unheard of even under the Czarist\r\n    régime. Red Guards and sailors, armed, invaded our premises. We\r\n    were searched in the rudest manner. Our goods and the provisions\r\n    which we had brought from home were stolen. Several of our\r\n    comrade-delegates and all the members of the Committee were\r\n    arrested and taken to Peter and Paul Fortress. We ourselves were,\r\n    late at night, put out of doors in a city which we did not know,\r\n    deprived of shelter under which to sleep. All that, to oblige us\r\n    either to go to Smolny, where the Bolshevist government called\r\n    another Congress, or to return to our homes without having\r\n    attained any result. But violence could not stop us; secretly, as\r\n    in the time of Czarist autocracy, we found a place to assemble and\r\n    to continue our work.\r\n\r\n    In making known these facts to the country and the numerous\r\n    millions of the peasant population, we call upon them to\r\n    stigmatize the revolting policy practised by the Bolshevik\r\n    government with regard to all those who are not in accord with it.\r\n    Returned to our villages, dispersed in every corner of immense\r\n    Russia, we shall use all our powers to make known to the mass of\r\n    peasants and to the entire country the truth concerning this\r\n    government of violence; to make known in every corner of the\r\n    fatherland that the actual government, which has the hardihood to\r\n    call itself \"Government of the Workmen and Peasants,\" in reality\r\n    shoots down workmen and peasants and shamelessly scoffs at the\r\n    country. We shall use all our strength to induce the population of\r\n    peasant workers to demand an account from this government of\r\n    violence, as well as from their prodigal children, their sons and\r\n    brothers, who in the army and navy give aid to these autocrats in\r\n    the commission of violence.\r\n\r\n    In the name of millions of peasants, by whom we were delegated, we\r\n    demand that they no longer obstruct the work of the Constituent\r\n    Assembly. We were not allowed to finish the work for which we had\r\n    come; at home we shall continue this work. We shall employ all our\r\n    strength to effect, as soon as possible, the convocation of a new\r\n    National Congress of Peasants' Delegates united on the principle\r\n    of the defense of the Constituante, and that in a place where we\r\n    need not fear a new dissolution. Lately we fought against\r\n    autocracy and Czarist violence; we shall fight with no less energy\r\n    against the new autocrats who practise violence, whoever they may\r\n    be, and whatever may be the shibboleths by which they cover their\r\n    criminal acts. We shall fight for the Constituent Assembly,\r\n    because it is in that alone that we see the salvation of our\r\n    country, that of the Revolution, and that of Land and Liberty.\r\n\r\n    Charged by our constituents to defend the Constituent Assembly, we\r\n    cannot participate in a Congress called by those who have\r\n    dissolved it; who have profaned the idea which to the people is\r\n    something sacred; who have shot down the defenders of true\r\n    democracy; who have shed the sacred blood of our Logvinov, member\r\n    of the Executive Committee of peasant deputies, who on the 5th of\r\n    January was killed by an explosive bullet during a peaceful\r\n    manifestation, bearing the flag \"Land and Liberty.\"\r\n    Comrade-peasants who have come by chance to this Congress declare\r\n    to these violators that the only Executive Committee that upholds\r\n    the idea of the defense of the Constituante forms a center around\r\n    which are grouped all the peasant workers. We call the entire mass\r\n    of peasants to the work that is common to all--the fight for \"Land\r\n    and Liberty,\" for the true government of the people. \"We all come\r\n    from the people, children of the same family of workers,\" and we\r\n    all have to follow a route that leads to happiness and liberty.\r\n    Now this road, which leads to \"Land and Liberty,\" goes through the\r\n    Constituent Assembly alone. The Constituent Assembly was\r\n    dissolved, but it was chosen by the entire people, and it ought to\r\n    live.\r\n\r\n    _Long live the Constituent Assembly!_\r\n    _Down with violence and tyranny!_\r\n    _All power to the people, through the agency of the_\r\n    _Constituent Assembly!_\r\n\r\n    [Signed] The Third National Congress of Soviets of Peasant\r\n    Delegates, United on the Principle of the Defense of the\r\n    Constituent Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCÈS-VERBAL OF THE SESSION OF THE III NATIONAL CONGRESS OF SOVIETS OF\r\nPEASANTS' DELEGATES, UNITED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF THE DEFENSE OF THE\r\nCONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY\r\n\r\nThe Provisional Executive Committee of Soviets of Peasants' Delegates\r\nnominated by the fraction of the Second National Congress of these Soviets,\r\nwhich, to the number of 359 delegates, was organized on the basis of the\r\nprinciple of the defense of the Constituent Assembly, had addressed to all\r\nthe Soviets an appeal inviting those who believe in the defense of the\r\nConstituante to send representatives to the Third Congress, fixed by the\r\nCommittee for the 8th of January, and destined to offset the Congress\r\ncalled for the 12th of January by the Committee of that fraction of the\r\nCongress which, to the number of 314 votes, took sides against the power of\r\nthe Constituent Assembly and joined the Bolsheviki.\r\n\r\nThe Peasants' Congress, meeting by districts and by governments, as well as\r\nthe local executive committees of Soviets which have chosen us, knew well\r\nto which Congress they delegated us and had given us precise mandates,\r\nexpressing their confidence in the Constituent Assembly and their blame of\r\nthe Soviets and the Bolshevik organs that impede the work of the\r\nConstituante and call the peasants to the Congress of January 12th. These\r\ncongresses and these committees have charged us to use all our efforts to\r\ndefend the Constituent Assembly, binding themselves, on their part, in case\r\nour efforts were insufficient, to rise in a body for its defense.\r\n\r\nBy reason of the disorganization of postal and telegraphic communications,\r\nand because in different localities the calls of the Committee were held up\r\nby the Bolshevist organizations, the instructions concerning the Congress\r\nfixed for the 8th of January were not received in many provinces until\r\nafter considerable delay.\r\n\r\nSome minutes before the opening of the Conference, which was to take place\r\non the premises of the Committee (11 Kirillovskaia Street), where the\r\ndelegates on hand had lodged, there arrived a detachment of sailors and Red\r\nGuards armed with guns and bombs, who surrounded the house, guarding all\r\nthe entrances, and occupied all the apartments. The Executive Committee,\r\nperforming its duty toward the peasant workers, which duty was to hold\r\ntheir flag with a firm hand, not fearing any violence, and not allowing\r\nthemselves to be intimidated by the bayonets and the bombs of the enemies\r\nof the peasant workers, opened the session at the hour indicated.\r\n\r\nThe Bolshevist pretorians, however, violating the freedom of assembly,\r\nbroke into the hall and surrounded the office and members of the Conference\r\nwith bayonets drawn. Their leader, Kornilov, staff-commandant of the Red\r\nGuards of the Rojdestvensky quarter, made a speech to the delegates, in\r\nwhich he said that they were to go to the Smolny Institute, to the\r\nBolshevist Congress, assuring them that they had come to this Congress by\r\nmistake; at the end he read a document ordering him to make a search of the\r\npremises, to confiscate all papers, and to arrest all who would offer\r\nresistance. In reply to this speech the delegates and the members of the\r\nExecutive Committee spoke in turn; they stigmatized vehemently the criminal\r\npolicy of the Bolshevist government, which dissolved the Constituent\r\nAssembly, the true representation of the popular will, without having given\r\nit the time to register a vote on the agricultural law; which shot down\r\nworkers participating in peaceful negotiations; which deprived the people\r\nof the right of assembly to discuss their needs; which destroyed freedom of\r\nspeech and assembly and trampled in the dust the whole Russian Revolution.\r\nThe delegates, one after another, tried to explain to the Red Guards that\r\nit was not the delegates that were deceived in coming to this conference,\r\nbut those who were going to Smolny to the Bolshevist Congress, those who,\r\nby order of the Bolsheviki, kill the peasants' representatives and dissolve\r\ntheir Congress.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these speeches Kornilov declared the Congress dissolved; to\r\nthis Comrade Ovtchinnikov, president of the Conference, replied that the\r\nCongress would not be dissolved except by force, and, besides, that the\r\ndocument read by Kornilov did not authorize him to pronounce its\r\ndissolution. Members of the Congress having entered into arguments with the\r\nsailors and the Red Guards, concerning the violence inflicted on the\r\npeasant delegates, the sound of the rattling of guns was heard and the\r\nleader of the pretorians declared that if the Congress would not submit to\r\nhis orders he would stop at nothing. All the members of the Congress were\r\nforthwith searched and thrown out of doors in groups of five, with the idea\r\nthat, having come from the provinces, and not knowing Petrograd, they would\r\nfind themselves dispersed in such a way as not to be able to assemble again\r\nanywhere, and would be obliged either to betake themselves to the railway\r\nand return home or to direct their steps toward Smolny, the address of\r\nwhich was given to each one at the exit. At the same time, without reason,\r\nthe following were arrested: Minor, a deputy to the Constituent Assembly;\r\nRakitnikov, Ovtchinnikov, Roussine, Sorokine, and Tchernobaiev, members of\r\nthe Executive Committee of the Soviet of Peasant Delegates; and Chmelev, a\r\nsoldier. The premises of the Committee, on which were various documents and\r\npapers which were to be sent into the country, were occupied by Red Guards,\r\nand machine-guns were placed at the entrance. The search ended about nine\r\no'clock in the evening. Some late delegates alone were authorized to spend\r\nthe night on the premises under the supervision of Red Guards.\r\n\r\nAn inquiry held among the comrades, who had come for this Third National\r\nPeasants' Congress, established that, at the time when the premises of the\r\nExecutive Committee were seized, January 10, 1918, there were, among the\r\nsailors and Red Guards of the detachment that did the work, _German and\r\nAustrian prisoners dressed in Russian uniforms_; it also established the\r\nfact that many objects had disappeared in the course of the search. The\r\nCongress decided: first, to consider as a law the socialization of the soil\r\nvoted by the Constituent Assembly and to apply the same in the country;\r\nsecond, to consider that the Constituent Assembly, dispersed by brutal\r\nforce, was nevertheless elected by the whole people and ought to exist and\r\nto assemble again as soon as that would be possible; third, to fight\r\neverywhere in the provinces in the defense of the organs of autonomous\r\nadministration, which the Bolsheviki dispersed by armed force. During these\r\nfew days when the peasants were obliged to assemble in secret and to\r\nstation patrols to protect their meetings, they followed those methods of\r\nconspiracy that the Russian Socialists had been obliged to employ when they\r\nfought against the tyranny of autocracy. Returning to their villages, the\r\npeasants bore with them the greatest hate for the Bolsheviki, whom they\r\nconsidered the personification of tyranny and violence. And they took with\r\nthem also a firm resolution to fight against this violence.\r\n\r\nThe Executive Committee, whose powers were confirmed by the Third Congress,\r\nfound itself thus, for the second time, deprived of all its goods, its\r\npremises, and its pecuniary resources; it found itself obliged to lead a\r\nhalf-clandestine existence, to organize secret assemblies, etc. Miss\r\nSpiridonova, who, in this fight against the peasants that rose to the\r\ndefense of the Constituent Assembly, gave proof of intolerance and peculiar\r\nfanaticism, found herself at the head of the \"peasants in uniform,\" sitting\r\nat Smolny, _adopting a decree whereby all the moneys that came by post to\r\nthe Executive Committee of the Soviet of Peasant Delegates defending the\r\nConstituent Assembly were to be confiscated._\r\n\r\nThe action of the Executive Committee was thus rendered very difficult. But\r\nit continued to fight, to publish an organ, to commission delegates, to\r\nentertain continued relations with the provinces and the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\n_Conclusion_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Morally, Bolshevism was killed in the eyes of the workers in the course of\r\nthese days_ when a peaceful demonstration was fired upon, the Constituent\r\nAssembly dissolved, the Peasant Congress (and, very soon, the Congress of\r\nthe Agricultural Committees) dispersed. The Central Committee of the\r\nRevolutionary Socialist party issued an order for new elections to the\r\nSoviets, thinking thus to eliminate automatically the Bolsheviki. And, in\r\ntruth, when at Petrograd and in the provinces, these elections began, the\r\nRevolutionary Socialists and the Mensheviki received the majority and the\r\nBolsheviki were snowed under. But these new elections were thwarted by many\r\ncircumstances: first, because of the lessening of production the workmen\r\nwere discharged in a body and quit the factories; second, the Bolsheviki\r\nput obstacles in the way of the elections and sometimes openly prohibited\r\nthem. Nevertheless, wherever they could be held, the results were\r\nunfavorable to the Bolsheviki.\r\n\r\nFinally, when the working classes clearly saw the shameful rôle played by\r\nthe Bolsheviki in the matter of peace, when they saw the Bolsheviki humbly\r\nbeg for peace at any price from the Germans, they understood that it was\r\nimpossible to continue to tolerate such a government. _The Central\r\nCommittee of the Revolutionary Socialist party published a Manifesto\r\nappealing to an armed fight against the Bolshevik government and the German\r\ngangs_ that were overrunning the country.\r\n\r\nThe frightful results of this \"peace,\" so extolled by the Bolsheviki,\r\nrendered even the name of the Bolshevist government odious in the eyes of\r\nevery conscientious and honest man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut Bolshevism still endures, for it is based on the armed force of the Red\r\nGuard, on the supineness of the masses deprived of a political education,\r\nand not accustomed to fight or to act, and from ancient habit of submitting\r\nto force.\r\n\r\nThe causes which produced Bolshevism are: first, the accumulation of all\r\nthe conditions of the historic past of the Russian people; second, their\r\npsychic character and their habits; third, the conditions of the present\r\ntime; and fourth, the general situation of the world--that is to say, the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nWe also note the vague and hesitating policy of the Provisional Government;\r\nthe lack of political education among the people, ready to follow him who\r\npromises the most; small development of civic sentiment; the want of any\r\nattachment whatever to the state--that of the Romanov having never given\r\nanything to the people and having taken all from them. Czarism took from\r\nthe miserable peasant his last penny under form of taxes; it took his\r\nchildren from him for war; for the least act of disobedience to authority\r\nhe was whipped. He wallowed in misery and in ignorance, deprived of every\r\nright, human or legal. How could he, this wretched and oppressed peasant\r\ndevelop civic sentiments, a consciousness of his personal dignity? On the\r\nother hand, we must take into account the immense weariness caused by the\r\nwar and by the disorganization which it brought into the whole cycle of\r\nexistence (to an incomparably greater degree than in western Europe). Such\r\nwere the causes which had established a favorable scope for Bolshevik\r\npropaganda; to introduce their domination they knew how to make use of the\r\nshortcomings of the people and the defects of Russian life.\r\n\r\nIn fine, what is Bolshevism in its essence? _It is an experiment, that is\r\neither criminal or that proceeds from a terrible thoughtlessness, tried,\r\nwithout their consent, on the living body of the Russian people_. Thus some\r\nattempt to apply their theories, others wish to measure the height of their\r\npersonal influence, while still others (and they are found in every\r\nmovement) seek to profit by the circumstances.\r\n\r\nBolshevism is a phenomenon brought about by force; it is not a natural\r\nconsequence of the progress of the Russian Revolution. Taken all in all,\r\nBolshevism is not Socialism. The Bolshevist _coup d'état_ was accomplished\r\ncontrary to the wish of the majority of the people, who were preparing for\r\nthe Constituent Assembly.\r\n\r\n_It was accomplished with the help of armed force, and it is because of\r\nthis that the Bolshevist régime holds out._\r\n\r\n_It has against it the whole conscious portion of the peasant and working\r\npopulation and all the Intellectuals._\r\n\r\n_It has crushed and trampled under foot the liberty that was won by the\r\nRussian people._\r\n\r\nThe Bolsheviki pretend to act in the name of the people. Why, then, have\r\nthey dissolved the Constituent Assembly elected by the people?\r\n\r\nThey pretend to have the majority of the people with them. Why, then, this\r\ngovernmental terror that is being used in a manner more cruel even than in\r\nthe time of Czarism?\r\n\r\nThey say that, to fight against the bourgeoisie, the use of violence is\r\nnecessary. But their principal thrusts are directed not against the\r\nbourgeoisie, but against the Socialist parties that do not agree with them.\r\nAnd they dare give this caricature the name of Dictatorship of the\r\nProletariat!\r\n\r\nSocialism must necessarily be founded on democratic principles. If not, \"it\r\ncuts off the branch of the tree on which it rests,\" according to the\r\nexpression of Kautsky.\r\n\r\nSocialism needs constructive elements. It does not limit itself to the\r\ndestruction of ancient forms of existence; it creates new ones. But\r\nBolshevism has only destructive elements. It does nothing but destroy,\r\nalways destroy, with a blind hatred, a savage fanaticism.\r\n\r\nWhat has it established? Its \"decrees\" are only verbal solutions without\r\nsense, skeletons of ideas, or simply a revolutionary phraseology containing\r\nnothing real (as for example the famous shibboleth, \"neither peace nor\r\nwar\").\r\n\r\nDuring the few months of its reign Bolshevism has succeeded in destroying\r\nmany things; nearly everything that the effort of the Russian people had\r\nestablished. Life, disorganized almost to its foundations, has become\r\nalmost impossible in Russia. The railroads do not function, or function\r\nonly with great difficulty; the postal and telegraphic communications are\r\ninterrupted in several places. The zemstvos--bases of the life of the\r\ncountry--are suppressed (they are \"bourgeois\" institutions); the schools\r\nand hospitals, whose existence is impossible without the zemstvos, are\r\nclosed. The most complete chaos exists in the food-supply. The\r\nIntellectuals, who, in Russia, had suffered so much from the Czarist\r\ntyranny and oppression, are declared \"enemies of the people\" and compelled\r\nto lead a clandestine existence; they are dying of hunger. It is the\r\nIntellectuals and not the bourgeois (who are hiding) that suffer most from\r\nthe Bolshevist régime.\r\n\r\nThe Soviets alone remain. But the Soviets are not only revolutionary\r\norgans, they are \"guardians of the Revolution,\" but in no way legislative\r\nand administrative organs.\r\n\r\nBolshevism is an experiment tried on the Russian people. The people are\r\ngoing to pay dearly for it. At least let not this experiment be lost, on\r\nthem, as well as on other peoples! Let the Socialists of western Europe be\r\nnot unduly elated by words or by far-fetched judgments. Let them look the\r\ncruel reality in the face and examine facts to find out the truth.\r\n\r\nA tyranny which is supported by bayonets is always repugnant, wherever it\r\ncomes from, and under whatever name it may strut. It can have nothing in\r\ncommon with Socialism, which is not only a doctrine of economic necessity,\r\nbut also a doctrine of superior justice and truth.\r\n\r\n\"All the societies or individuals adhering to the Internationale will know\r\nwhat must be the basis of their conduct toward all men: Truth, Justice,\r\nMorality, without Distinction of Color, Creed, or Nationality,\" said the\r\nstatutes that were drawn up by the prime founders of our Internationale.\r\n\r\n_The Executive Committee of the National Soviet of Peasant Delegates\r\nPlacing themselves on the Grounds of the Defense of the Constituent\r\nAssembly, having had to examine, in its session of February 8, 1918, the\r\nviolence committed by the Bolsheviki, and to pass in review the\r\npersecutions that this organization had to suffer from that party and from\r\nthe government of the Commissaries of the People, decided to bring the\r\nviolence committed by the Bolsheviki in the name of Socialism to the\r\nknowledge of the Socialists of western Europe and of the International\r\nSocialist Bureau through the citizen, E. Roubanovitch, representative of\r\nthe Revolutionary Socialist party at the International Socialist Bureau and\r\nintrusted with International relations by the Executive Committee of the\r\nFirst Soviet of Peasants.\r\n\r\nThe Executive Committee demands the expulsion, from the Socialist family,\r\nof the Bolshevist leaders, as well as of those of the Revolutionary\r\nSocialists of the Left, who seized the power by force, held it by violence\r\nand compromised Socialism in the eyes of the popular masses.\r\n\r\nLet our brothers of western Europe be judges between the Socialist peasants\r\nwho rose in the defense of the Constituent Assembly and the Bolsheviki, who\r\ndispersed them by armed force, thus trampling under foot the will of the\r\nRussian people._\r\n\r\nINNA RAKITNIKOV,\r\n\r\n_Vice-President of the Executive Committee of the Soviet of Peasant\r\nDelegates, who stand in Defense of the Constituent Assembly._\r\n\r\n_May 30, 1918._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX III\r\n\r\nFORMER SOCIALIST PREMIER OF FINLAND ON BOLSHEVISM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following letter was addressed to Mr. Santeri Nuorteva, who, it will be\r\nremembered, was appointed Minister to America by the Revolutionary\r\nGovernment of Finland. The author of the letter, Oskar Tokoi, was the first\r\nSocialist Prime Minister in the world. He is a Socialist of long standing,\r\nwho has always been identified with the radical section of the movement.\r\nMr. Nuorteva, it should be added, is himself a strong supporter of the\r\nBolsheviki, and is their accredited American representative.\r\n\r\n    ARCHANGEL, _September 10, 1918._\r\n\r\n    SANTERI NUORTEVA,\r\n\r\n    _Fitchburg, Mass._:\r\n\r\n    DEAR COMRADE,--I deem it my duty to appeal to you and to\r\n    other comrades in America in order to be able to make clear to you\r\n    the trend of events here.\r\n\r\n    The situation here has become particularly critical. We, the\r\n    Finnish refugees, who, after the unfortunate revolution, had to\r\n    flee from Finland to Russia, find ourselves to-day in a very\r\n    tragic situation. A part of the former Red Guardists who fled here\r\n    have joined the Red Army formed by the Russian Soviet Government;\r\n    another part has formed itself as a special Finnish legion, allied\r\n    with the army of the Allied countries; and a third part, which has\r\n    gone as far as to Siberia, is prowling about there, diffused over\r\n    many sections of the country, and there have been reports that a\r\n    part of those Finns have joined the ranks of the Czecho-Slovaks.\r\n    The Finnish masses, thus divided, may therefore at any time get\r\n    into fighting each other, which indeed would be the greatest of\r\n    all misfortunes. It is therefore necessary to take a clear\r\n    position, and to induce all the Finns to support it, and we hope\r\n    that you as well, over in America, will support it as much as is\r\n    in your power.\r\n\r\n    During these my wanderings I have happened to traverse Russia from\r\n    one end to another, and I have become deeply convinced that Russia\r\n    is not able to rise from this state of chaos and confusion by her\r\n    own strength and of her own accord. The magnificent economic\r\n    revolution, which the Bolsheviki in Russia are trying now to bring\r\n    about, is doomed in Russia to complete failure. The economic\r\n    conditions in Russia have not even approximately reached a stage\r\n    to make an economic revolution possible, and the low grade of\r\n    education, as well as the unsteady character of the Russian\r\n    people, makes it still more impossible.\r\n\r\n    It is true that magnificent theories and plans have been laid\r\n    here, but their putting into practice is altogether impossible,\r\n    principally because of the following reasons: The whole propertied\r\n    class--which here in Russia, where small property ownership mainly\r\n    prevails, is very numerous--is opposing and obstructing;\r\n    technically trained people and specialists necessary in the\r\n    industries are obstructing; local committees and sub-organs make\r\n    all systematic action impossible, as they in their respective\r\n    fields determine things quite autocratically and make everything\r\n    unsuccessful which should be based on a strong, coherent, and in\r\n    every respect minutely conceived system as a social production\r\n    should be based. But even if all these, in themselves\r\n    unsurmountable obstacles, could be made away with, there remains\r\n    still the worst one--and that is the workers themselves.\r\n\r\n    It is already clear that in the face of such economic conditions\r\n    the whole social order has been upset. Naturally only a small part\r\n    of the people will remain backing such an order. The whole\r\n    propertied class belongs to the opponents of the government,\r\n    including the petty bourgeoisie, the craftsmen, the small\r\n    merchants, the profiteers. The whole Intellectual class and a\r\n    great part of the workers are also opposing the government. In\r\n    comparison with the entire population only a small minority\r\n    supports the government, and, what is worse to the supporters of\r\n    the government, are rallying all the hooligans, robbers, and\r\n    others to whom this period of confusion promises a good chance of\r\n    individual action. It is also clear that such a régime cannot stay\r\n    but with the help of a stern terror. But, on the other hand, the\r\n    longer the terror continues the more disagreeable and hated it\r\n    becomes. Even a great part of those who from the beginning could\r\n    stay with the government and who still are sincere Social\r\n    Democrats, having seen all this chaos, begin to step aside, or to\r\n    ally themselves with those openly opposing the government.\r\n    Naturally, as time goes by, there remains only the worst and the\r\n    most demoralized element. Terror, arbitrary rule, and open\r\n    brigandage become more and more usual, and the government is not\r\n    able at all to prevent it. And the outcome is clearly to be\r\n    foreseen--the unavoidable failure of all this magnificently\r\n    planned system.\r\n\r\n    And what will be the outcome of that? My conviction is that as\r\n    soon as possible we should turn toward the other road--the road of\r\n    united action. I have seen, and I am convinced that the majority\r\n    of the Russian people is fundamentally democratic and\r\n    whole-heartedly detests a reinstitution of autocracy, and that\r\n    therefore all such elements must, without delay, be made to unite.\r\n    But it is also clear that at first they, even united, will not be\r\n    able to bring about order in this country on their own accord. I\r\n    do not believe that at this time there is in Russia any social\r\n    force which would be able to organize the conditions in the\r\n    country. For that reason, to my mind, we should, to begin with,\r\n    frankly and honestly rely on the help of the Allied Powers. Help\r\n    from Germany cannot be considered, as Germany, because of her own\r\n    interests, is compelled to support the Bolshevik rule as long as\r\n    possible, as Germany from the Bolshevik rule is pressing more and\r\n    more political and economic advantages, to such an extent even\r\n    that all of Russia is becoming practically a colony of Germany.\r\n    Russia thus would serve to compensate Germany for the colonies\r\n    lost in South Africa.\r\n\r\n    A question presents itself at once whether the Allied Powers are\r\n    better. And it must be answered instantly that neither would they\r\n    establish in Russia any Socialist society. Yet the democratic\r\n    traditions of these countries are some surety that the social\r\n    order established by them will be a democratic one. It is clear as\r\n    day that the policy of the Allied Powers is also imperialistic,\r\n    but the geographical and economic position of these countries is\r\n    such that even their own interests demand that Russia should be\r\n    able to develop somewhat freely. The problem has finally evolved\r\n    into such a state of affairs where Russia must rely on the help\r\n    either of the Allies or Germany; we must choose, as the saying\r\n    goes, \"between two evils,\" and, things being as badly mixed as\r\n    they are, the lesser evil must be chosen frankly and openly. It\r\n    does not seem possible to get anywhere by dodging the issue.\r\n    Russia perhaps would have saved herself some time ago from this\r\n    unfortunate situation if she had understood immediately after the\r\n    February Revolution the necessity of a union between the more\r\n    democratic elements. Bolshevism undoubtedly has brought Russia a\r\n    big step toward her misfortune, from which she cannot extricate\r\n    herself on her own accord.\r\n\r\n    Thus there exists no more any purely Socialist army, and all the\r\n    fighting forces and all those who have taken to arms are fighting\r\n    for the interests of the one or the other group of the Great\r\n    Powers. The question therefore finally is only this--in the\r\n    interests of which group one wants to fight. The revolutionary\r\n    struggles in Russia and in Finland, to my mind, have clearly\r\n    established that a Socialist society cannot be brought about by\r\n    the force of arms and cannot be supported by the force of arms,\r\n    but that a Socialist order must be founded on a conscious and\r\n    living will by an overwhelming majority of the nations, which is\r\n    able to realize its will without the help of arms.\r\n\r\n    But now that the nations of the world have actually been thrown\r\n    into an armed conflict, and the war, which in itself is the\r\n    greatest crime of the world, still is raging, we must stand it. We\r\n    must, however, destroy the originator and the cause of the war,\r\n    the militarism, by its own arms, and on its ruins we must build,\r\n    in harmony and in peace--not by force, as the Russian Bolsheviki\r\n    want--a new and a better social order under the guardianship of\r\n    which the people may develop peacefully and securely.\r\n\r\n    I have been explaining to you my ideas, expecting that you will\r\n    publish them. You over in America are not able to imagine how\r\n    horrible the life in Russia at the present time is. The period\r\n    after the French Revolution surely must have been as a life in a\r\n    paradise compared with this. Hunger, brigandage, arrests, and\r\n    murders are such every-day events that nobody pays any attention\r\n    to them. Freedom of assemblage, association, free speech, and free\r\n    press is a far-away ideal which is altogether destroyed at the\r\n    present time. Arbitrary rule and terror are raging everywhere,\r\n    and, what is worst of all, not only the terror proclaimed by the\r\n    government, but individual terror as well.\r\n\r\n    My greetings to all friends and comrades.\r\n\r\n    OSKAR TOKOI.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Plechanov never formally joined the Menshevik faction, I believe, but\r\nhis writings showed that he favored that faction and the Mensheviki\r\nacknowledged his intellectual leadership.\r\n\r\n[2] They had gained one member since the election.\r\n\r\n[3] Quoted by Litvinov, _The Bolshevik Revolution: Its Rise and Meaning_,\r\np. 22.
