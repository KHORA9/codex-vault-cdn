SPEED. SPRINGFIELD, May 18, 1843.\r\n\r\nDEAR SPEED:--Yours of the 9th instant is duly received, which I do\r\nnot meet as a \"bore,\" but as a most welcome visitor. I will answer the\r\nbusiness part of it first.\r\n\r\nIn relation to our Congress matter here, you were right in supposing I\r\nwould support the nominee. Neither Baker nor I, however, is the man, but\r\nHardin, so far as I can judge from present appearances. We shall have no\r\nsplit or trouble about the matter; all will be harmony. In relation to\r\nthe \"coming events\" about which Butler wrote you, I had not heard one word\r\nbefore I got your letter; but I have so much confidence in the judgment of\r\nButler on such a subject that I incline to think there may be some reality\r\nin it. What day does Butler appoint? By the way, how do \"events\" of the\r\nsame sort come on in your family? Are you possessing houses and lands, and\r\noxen and asses, and men-servants and maid-servants, and begetting sons\r\nand daughters? We are not keeping house, but boarding at the Globe Tavern,\r\nwhich is very well kept now by a widow lady of the name of Beck. Our room\r\n(the same that Dr. Wallace occupied there) and boarding only costs us four\r\ndollars a week. Ann Todd was married something more than a year since to\r\na fellow by the name of Campbell, and who, Mary says, is pretty much of\r\na \"dunce,\" though he has a little money and property. They live in\r\nBoonville, Missouri, and have not been heard from lately enough for me to\r\nsay anything about her health. I reckon it will scarcely be in our\r\npower to visit Kentucky this year. Besides poverty and the necessity of\r\nattending to business, those \"coming events,\" I suspect, would be somewhat\r\nin the way. I most heartily wish you and your Fanny would not fail to\r\ncome. Just let us know the time, and we will have a room provided for you\r\nat our house, and all be merry together for a while. Be sure to give my\r\nrespects to your mother and family; assure her that if ever I come near\r\nher, I will not fail to call and see her. Mary joins in sending love to\r\nyour Fanny and you.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1844\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO Gen. J. J. HARDIN.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, May 21, 1844.\r\n\r\nDEAR HARDIN: Knowing that you have correspondents enough, I have forborne\r\nto trouble you heretofore; and I now only do so to get you to set a matter\r\nright which has got wrong with one of our best friends. It is old Uncle\r\nThomas Campbell of Spring Creek--(Berlin P.O.). He has received several\r\ndocuments from you, and he says they are old newspapers and documents,\r\nhaving no sort of interest in them. He is, therefore, getting a strong\r\nimpression that you treat him with disrespect. This, I know, is a mistaken\r\nimpression; and you must correct it. The way, I leave to yourself. Rob't\r\nW. Canfield says he would like to have a document or two from you.\r\n\r\nThe Locos (Democrats) here are in considerable trouble about Van Buren's\r\nletter on Texas, and the Virginia electors. They are growing sick of the\r\nTariff question; and consequently are much confounded at V.B.'s cutting\r\nthem off from the new Texas question. Nearly half the leaders swear they\r\nwon't stand it. Of those are Ford, T. Campbell, Ewing, Calhoun and others.\r\nThey don't exactly say they won't vote for V.B., but they say he will not\r\nbe the candidate, and that they are for Texas anyhow.\r\n\r\nAs ever yours,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1845\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTION OF CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATES\r\n\r\nTO Gen. J. J. HARDIN, SPRINGFIELD, Jany. 19, 1845.\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL:\r\n\r\nI do not wish to join in your proposal of a new plan for the selection of\r\na Whig candidate for Congress because:\r\n\r\n1st. I am entirely satisfied with the old system under which you and Baker\r\nwere successively nominated and elected to Congress; and because the Whigs\r\nof the district are well acquainted with the system, and, so far as I know\r\nor believe, are well satisfied with it. If the old system be thought to be\r\nvague, as to all the delegates of the county voting the same way, or as\r\nto instructions to them as to whom they are to vote for, or as to filling\r\nvacancies, I am willing to join in a provision to make these matters\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\n2d. As to your proposals that a poll shall be opened in every precinct,\r\nand that the whole shall take place on the same day, I do not personally\r\nobject. They seem to me to be not unfair; and I forbear to join in\r\nproposing them only because I choose to leave the decision in each\r\ncounty to the Whigs of the county, to be made as their own judgment and\r\nconvenience may dictate.\r\n\r\n3d. As to your proposed stipulation that all the candidates shall remain\r\nin their own counties, and restrain their friends in the same it seems\r\nto me that on reflection you will see the fact of your having been in\r\nCongress has, in various ways, so spread your name in the district as\r\nto give you a decided advantage in such a stipulation. I appreciate your\r\ndesire to keep down excitement; and I promise you to \"keep cool\" under all\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n4th. I have already said I am satisfied with the old system under which\r\nsuch good men have triumphed and that I desire no departure from its\r\nprinciples. But if there must be a departure from it, I shall insist upon\r\na more accurate and just apportionment of delegates, or representative\r\nvotes, to the constituent body, than exists by the old, and which you\r\npropose to retain in your new plan. If we take the entire population of\r\nthe counties as shown by the late census, we shall see by the old plan,\r\nand by your proposed new plan,\r\n\r\n   Morgan County, with a population 16,541, has but ....... 8 votes\r\n   While Sangamon with 18,697--2156 greater has but ....... 8  \"\r\n   So Scott with 6553 has ................................. 4  \"\r\n   While Tazewell with 7615 1062 greater has but .......... 4  \"\r\n   So Mason with 3135 has ................................. 1 vote\r\n   While Logan with 3907, 772 greater, has but ............ 1  \"\r\n\r\nAnd so on in a less degree the matter runs through all the counties, being\r\nnot only wrong in principle, but the advantage of it being all manifestly\r\nin your favor with one slight exception, in the comparison of two counties\r\nnot here mentioned.\r\n\r\nAgain, if we take the Whig votes of the counties as shown by the late\r\nPresidential election as a basis, the thing is still worse.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me most obvious that the old system needs adjustment in\r\nnothing so much as in this; and still, by your proposal, no notice is\r\ntaken of it. I have always been in the habit of acceding to almost any\r\nproposal that a friend would make and I am truly sorry that I cannot in\r\nthis. I perhaps ought to mention that some friends at different places are\r\nendeavoring to secure the honor of the sitting of the convention at their\r\ntowns respectively, and I fear that they would not feel much complimented\r\nif we shall make a bargain that it should sit nowhere.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ------ WILLIAMS,\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, March 1, 1845.\r\n\r\nFRIEND WILLIAMS:\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court adjourned this morning for the term. Your cases of\r\nReinhardt vs. Schuyler, Bunce vs. Schuyler, Dickhut vs. Dunell, and\r\nSullivan vs. Andrews are continued. Hinman vs. Pope I wrote you concerning\r\nsome time ago. McNutt et al. vs. Bean and Thompson is reversed and\r\nremanded.\r\n\r\nFitzpatrick vs. Brady et al. is reversed and remanded with leave to\r\ncomplainant to amend his bill so as to show the real consideration given\r\nfor the land.\r\n\r\nBunce against Graves the court confirmed, wherefore, in accordance with\r\nyour directions, I moved to have the case remanded to enable you to take a\r\nnew trial in the court below. The court allowed the motion; of which I am\r\nglad, and I guess you are.\r\n\r\nThis, I believe, is all as to court business. The canal men have got their\r\nmeasure through the Legislature pretty much or quite in the shape they\r\ndesired. Nothing else now.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABOLITION MOVEMENT\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAMSON DURLEY.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, October 3, 1845\r\n\r\nWhen I saw you at home, it was agreed that I should write to you and your\r\nbrother Madison. Until I then saw you I was not aware of your being what\r\nis generally called an abolitionist, or, as you call yourself, a Liberty\r\nman, though I well knew there were many such in your country.\r\n\r\nI was glad to hear that you intended to attempt to bring about, at the\r\nnext election in Putnam, a Union of the Whigs proper and such of the\r\nLiberty men as are Whigs in principle on all questions save only that of\r\nslavery. So far as I can perceive, by such union neither party need\r\nyield anything on the point in difference between them. If the Whig\r\nabolitionists of New York had voted with us last fall, Mr. Clay would now\r\nbe President, Whig principles in the ascendant, and Texas not annexed;\r\nwhereas, by the division, all that either had at stake in the contest was\r\nlost. And, indeed, it was extremely probable, beforehand, that such would\r\nbe the result. As I always understood, the Liberty men deprecated the\r\nannexation of Texas extremely; and this being so, why they should refuse\r\nto cast their votes [so] as to prevent it, even to me seemed wonderful.\r\nWhat was their process of reasoning, I can only judge from what a single\r\none of them told me. It was this: \"We are not to do evil that good may\r\ncome.\" This general proposition is doubtless correct; but did it apply?\r\nIf by your votes you could have prevented the extension, etc., of slavery\r\nwould it not have been good, and not evil, so to have used your votes,\r\neven though it involved the casting of them for a slaveholder? By the\r\nfruit the tree is to be known. An evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit.\r\nIf the fruit of electing Mr. Clay would have been to prevent the extension\r\nof slavery, could the act of electing have been evil?\r\n\r\nBut I will not argue further. I perhaps ought to say that individually I\r\nnever was much interested in the Texas question. I never could see\r\nmuch good to come of annexation, inasmuch as they were already a free\r\nrepublican people on our own model. On the other hand, I never could\r\nvery clearly see how the annexation would augment the evil of slavery.\r\nIt always seemed to me that slaves would be taken there in about equal\r\nnumbers, with or without annexation. And if more were taken because of\r\nannexation, still there would be just so many the fewer left where\r\nthey were taken from. It is possibly true, to some extent, that, with\r\nannexation, some slaves may be sent to Texas and continued in slavery that\r\notherwise might have been liberated. To whatever extent this may be true,\r\nI think annexation an evil. I hold it to be a paramount duty of us in the\r\nfree States, due to the Union of the States, and perhaps to liberty itself\r\n(paradox though it may seem), to let the slavery of the other States\r\nalone; while, on the other hand, I hold it to be equally clear that we\r\nshould never knowingly lend ourselves, directly or indirectly, to prevent\r\nthat slavery from dying a natural death--to find new places for it to\r\nlive in when it can no longer exist in the old. Of course I am not now\r\nconsidering what would be our duty in cases of insurrection among the\r\nslaves. To recur to the Texas question, I understand the Liberty men to\r\nhave viewed annexation as a much greater evil than ever I did; and I would\r\nlike to convince you, if I could, that they could have prevented it, if\r\nthey had chosen. I intend this letter for you and Madison together; and\r\nif you and he or either shall think fit to drop me a line, I shall be\r\npleased.\r\n\r\nYours with respect,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1846\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR POLITICAL SUPPORT\r\n\r\nTO Dr. ROBERT BOAL. SPRINGFIELD, January 7, 1846.\r\n\r\nDr. ROBERT BOAL, Lacon, Ill.\r\n\r\nDEAR DOCTOR:--Since I saw you last fall, I have often thought of writing\r\nto you, as it was then understood I would, but, on reflection, I have\r\nalways found that I had nothing new to tell you. All has happened as I\r\nthen told you I expected it would--Baker's declining, Hardin's taking the\r\ntrack, and so on.\r\n\r\nIf Hardin and I stood precisely equal, if neither of us had been to\r\nCongress, or if we both had, it would only accord with what I have always\r\ndone, for the sake of peace, to give way to him; and I expect I should do\r\nit. That I can voluntarily postpone my pretensions, when they are no more\r\nthan equal to those to which they are postponed, you have yourself seen.\r\nBut to yield to Hardin under present circumstances seems to me as nothing\r\nelse than yielding to one who would gladly sacrifice me altogether. This\r\nI would rather not submit to. That Hardin is talented, energetic, usually\r\ngenerous and magnanimous, I have before this affirmed to you and do not\r\ndeny. You know that my only argument is that \"turn about is fair play.\"\r\nThis he, practically at least, denies.\r\n\r\nIf it would not be taxing you too much, I wish you would write me, telling\r\nthe aspect of things in your country, or rather your district; and also,\r\nsend the names of some of your Whig neighbors, to whom I might, with\r\npropriety, write. Unless I can get some one to do this, Hardin, with his\r\nold franking list, will have the advantage of me. My reliance for a fair\r\nshake (and I want nothing more) in your country is chiefly on you, because\r\nof your position and standing, and because I am acquainted with so few\r\nothers. Let me hear from you soon.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN BENNETT.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Jan. 15, 1846.\r\n\r\nJOHN BENNETT.\r\n\r\nFRIEND JOHN:\r\n\r\nNathan Dresser is here, and speaks as though the contest between Hardin\r\nand me is to be doubtful in Menard County. I know he is candid and this\r\nalarms me some. I asked him to tell me the names of the men that were\r\ngoing strong for Hardin, he said Morris was about as strong as any-now\r\ntell me, is Morris going it openly? You remember you wrote me that he\r\nwould be neutral. Nathan also said that some man, whom he could not\r\nremember, had said lately that Menard County was going to decide the\r\ncontest and that made the contest very doubtful. Do you know who that\r\nwas? Don't fail to write me instantly on receiving this, telling me\r\nall--particularly the names of those who are going strong against me.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO N. J. ROCKWELL.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, January 21, 1846.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--You perhaps know that General Hardin and I have a contest for\r\nthe Whig nomination for Congress for this district.\r\n\r\nHe has had a turn and my argument is \"turn about is fair play.\"\r\n\r\nI shall be pleased if this strikes you as a sufficient argument.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES BERDAN.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, April 26, 1846.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--I thank you for the promptness with which you answered my\r\nletter from Bloomington. I also thank you for the frankness with which you\r\ncomment upon a certain part of my letter; because that comment affords\r\nme an opportunity of trying to express myself better than I did before,\r\nseeing, as I do, that in that part of my letter, you have not understood\r\nme as I intended to be understood.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the \"dissatisfaction\" of men who yet mean to do no wrong,\r\netc., I mean no special application of what I said to the Whigs of Morgan,\r\nor of Morgan & Scott. I only had in my mind the fact that previous to\r\nGeneral Hardin's withdrawal some of his friends and some of mine had\r\nbecome a little warm; and I felt, and meant to say, that for them now to\r\nmeet face to face and converse together was the best way to efface any\r\nremnant of unpleasant feeling, if any such existed.\r\n\r\nI did not suppose that General Hardin's friends were in any greater need\r\nof having their feelings corrected than mine were. Since I saw you at\r\nJacksonville, I have had no more suspicion of the Whigs of Morgan than\r\nof those of any other part of the district. I write this only to try to\r\nremove any impression that I distrust you and the other Whigs of your\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES BERDAN.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, May 7, 1866.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--It is a matter of high moral obligation, if not of necessity,\r\nfor me to attend the Coles and Edwards courts. I have some cases in both\r\nof them, in which the parties have my promise, and are depending upon me.\r\nThe court commences in Coles on the second Monday, and in Edgar on the\r\nthird. Your court in Morgan commences on the fourth Monday; and it is my\r\npurpose to be with you then, and make a speech. I mention the Coles and\r\nEdgar courts in order that if I should not reach Jacksonville at the time\r\nnamed you may understand the reason why. I do not, however, think there is\r\nmuch danger of my being detained; as I shall go with a purpose not to be,\r\nand consequently shall engage in no new cases that might delay me.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVERSES WRITTEN BY LINCOLN AFTER A VISIT TO HIS OLD HOME IN INDIANA\r\n\r\n(A FRAGMENT).\r\n\r\n[In December, 1847, when Lincoln was stumping for Clay, he crossed into\r\nIndiana and revisited his old home. He writes: \"That part of the country\r\nis within itself as unpoetical as any spot on earth; but still seeing\r\nit and its objects and inhabitants aroused feelings in me which were\r\ncertainly poetry; though whether my expression of these feelings is\r\npoetry, is quite another question.\"]\r\n\r\n   Near twenty years have passed away\r\n   Since here I bid farewell\r\n   To woods and fields, and scenes of play,\r\n   And playmates loved so well.\r\n\r\n   Where many were, but few remain\r\n   Of old familiar things;\r\n   But seeing them to mind again\r\n   The lost and absent brings.\r\n\r\n   The friends I left that parting day,\r\n   How changed, as time has sped!\r\n   Young childhood grown, strong manhood gray,\r\n   And half of all are dead.\r\n\r\n   I hear the loved survivors tell\r\n   How naught from death could save,\r\n   Till every sound appears a knell,\r\n   And every spot a grave.\r\n\r\n   I range the fields with pensive tread,\r\n   And pace the hollow rooms,\r\n   And feel (companion of the dead)\r\n   I 'm living in the tombs.\r\n\r\n   VERSES WRITTEN BY LINCOLN CONCERNING A SCHOOL-FELLOW\r\n   WHO BECAME INSANE--(A FRAGMENT).\r\n\r\n   And when at length the drear and long\r\n   Time soothed thy fiercer woes,\r\n   How plaintively thy mournful song\r\n   Upon the still night rose\r\n\r\n   I've heard it oft as if I dreamed,\r\n   Far distant, sweet and lone;\r\n   The funeral dirge it ever seemed\r\n   Of reason dead and gone.\r\n\r\n   Air held her breath; trees with the spell\r\n   Seemed sorrowing angels round,\r\n   Whose swelling tears in dewdrops fell\r\n   Upon the listening ground.\r\n\r\n   But this is past, and naught remains\r\n   That raised thee o'er the brute;\r\n   Thy piercing shrieks and soothing strains\r\n   Are like, forever mute.\r\n\r\n   Now fare thee well! More thou the cause\r\n   Than subject now of woe.\r\n   All mental pangs by time's kind laws\r\n   Hast lost the power to know.\r\n\r\n   O Death! thou awe-inspiring prince\r\n   That keepst the world in fear,\r\n   Why dost thou tear more blest ones hence,\r\n   And leave him lingering here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND CHILD\r\n\r\nTO JOSHUA P. SPEED\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, October 22, 1846.\r\n\r\nDEAR SPEED:--You, no doubt, assign the suspension of our correspondence to\r\nthe true philosophic cause; though it must be confessed by both of us that\r\nthis is rather a cold reason for allowing a friendship such as ours to\r\ndie out by degrees. I propose now that, upon receipt of this, you shall be\r\nconsidered in my debt, and under obligations to pay soon, and that neither\r\nshall remain long in arrears hereafter. Are you agreed?\r\n\r\nBeing elected to Congress, though I am very grateful to our friends for\r\nhaving done it, has not pleased me as much as I expected.\r\n\r\nWe have another boy, born the 10th of March. He is very much such a child\r\nas Bob was at his age, rather of a longer order. Bob is \"short and low,\"\r\nand I expect always will be. He talks very plainly,--almost as plainly as\r\nanybody. He is quite smart enough. I sometimes fear that he is one of the\r\nlittle rare-ripe sort that are smarter at about five than ever after. He\r\nhas a great deal of that sort of mischief that is the offspring of such\r\nanimal spirits. Since I began this letter, a messenger came to tell me Bob\r\nwas lost; but by the time I reached the house his mother had found him and\r\nhad him whipped, and by now, very likely, he is run away again. Mary has\r\nread your letter, and wishes to be remembered to Mrs. Speed and you, in\r\nwhich I most sincerely join her.\r\n\r\nAs ever yours,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MORRIS AND BROWN\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, October 21, 1847.\r\n\r\nMESSRS. MORRIS AND BROWN.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--Your second letter on the matter of Thornton and others, came\r\nto hand this morning. I went at once to see Logan, and found that he\r\nis not engaged against you, and that he has so sent you word by Mr.\r\nButterfield, as he says. He says that some time ago, a young man (who he\r\nknows not) came to him, with a copy of the affidavit, to engage him to aid\r\nin getting the Governor to grant the warrant; and that he, Logan, told\r\nthe man, that in his opinion, the affidavit was clearly insufficient, upon\r\nwhich the young man left, without making any engagement with him. If the\r\nGovernor shall arrive before I leave, Logan and I will both attend to the\r\nmatter, and he will attend to it, if he does not come till after I leave;\r\nall upon the condition that the Governor shall not have acted upon the\r\nmatter, before his arrival here. I mention this condition because, I\r\nlearned this morning from the Secretary of State, that he is forwarding to\r\nthe Governor, at Palestine, all papers he receives in the case, as fast\r\nas he receives them. Among the papers forwarded will be your letter to\r\nthe Governor or Secretary of, I believe, the same date and about the same\r\ncontents of your last letter to me; so that the Governor will, at all\r\nevents have your points and authorities. The case is a clear one on our\r\nside; but whether the Governor will view it so is another thing.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM H. HERNDON\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, December 5, 1847.\r\n\r\nDEAR WILLIAM:--You may remember that about a year ago a man by the name of\r\nWilson (James Wilson, I think) paid us twenty dollars as an advance fee to\r\nattend to a case in the Supreme Court for him, against a Mr. Campbell, the\r\nrecord of which case was in the hands of Mr. Dixon of St. Louis, who never\r\nfurnished it to us. When I was at Bloomington last fall I met a friend\r\nof Wilson, who mentioned the subject to me, and induced me to write to\r\nWilson, telling him I would leave the ten dollars with you which had been\r\nleft with me to pay for making abstracts in the case, so that the case may\r\ngo on this winter; but I came away, and forgot to do it. What I want now\r\nis to send you the money, to be used accordingly, if any one comes on to\r\nstart the case, or to be retained by you if no one does.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing of consequence new here. Congress is to organize\r\nto-morrow. Last night we held a Whig caucus for the House, and nominated\r\nWinthrop of Massachusetts for speaker, Sargent of Pennsylvania for\r\nsergeant-at-arms, Homer of New Jersey door-keeper, and McCormick of\r\nDistrict of Columbia postmaster. The Whig majority in the House is so\r\nsmall that, together with some little dissatisfaction, [it] leaves it\r\ndoubtful whether we will elect them all.\r\n\r\nThis paper is too thick to fold, which is the reason I send only a\r\nhalf-sheet.\r\n\r\nYours as ever, A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM H. HERNDON.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, December 13, 1847\r\n\r\nDEAR WILLIAM:--Your letter, advising me of the receipt of our fee in the\r\nbank case, is just received, and I don't expect to hear another as good a\r\npiece of news from Springfield while I am away. I am under no obligations\r\nto the bank; and I therefore wish you to buy bank certificates, and pay my\r\ndebt there, so as to pay it with the least money possible. I would as soon\r\nyou should buy them of Mr. Ridgely, or any other person at the bank, as of\r\nany one else, provided you can get them as cheaply. I suppose, after the\r\nbank debt shall be paid, there will be some money left, out of which I\r\nwould like to have you pay Lavely and Stout twenty dollars, and Priest and\r\nsomebody (oil-makers) ten dollars, for materials got for house-painting.\r\nIf there shall still be any left, keep it till you see or hear from me.\r\n\r\nI shall begin sending documents so soon as I can get them. I wrote you\r\nyesterday about a \"Congressional Globe.\" As you are all so anxious for me\r\nto distinguish myself, I have concluded to do so before long.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESOLUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 22, 1847\r\n\r\nWhereas, The President of the United States, in his message of May 11,\r\n1846, has declared that \"the Mexican Government not only refused to\r\nreceive him [the envoy of the United States], or to listen to his\r\npropositions, but, after a long-continued series of menaces, has at last\r\ninvaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our own\r\nsoil\";\r\n\r\nAnd again, in his message of December 8, 1846, that \"we had ample cause of\r\nwar against Mexico long before the breaking out of hostilities; but even\r\nthen we forbore to take redress into our own hands until Mexico herself\r\nbecame the aggressor, by invading our soil in hostile array, and shedding\r\nthe blood of our citizens\";\r\n\r\nAnd yet again, in his message of December 7, 1847, that \"the Mexican\r\nGovernment refused even to hear the terms of adjustment which he [our\r\nminister of peace] was authorized to propose, and finally, under wholly\r\nunjustifiable pretexts, involved the two countries in war, by invading the\r\nterritory of the State of Texas, striking the first blow, and shedding the\r\nblood of our citizens on our own soil\";\r\n\r\nAnd whereas, This House is desirous to obtain a full knowledge of all the\r\nfacts which go to establish whether the particular spot on which the blood\r\nof our citizens was so shed was or was not at that time our own soil:\r\ntherefore,\r\n\r\nResolved, By the House of Representatives, that the President of the\r\nUnited States be respectfully requested to inform this House:\r\n\r\nFirst. Whether the spot on which the blood of our citizens was shed, as\r\nin his message declared, was or was not within the territory of Spain, at\r\nleast after the treaty of 1819, until the Mexican revolution.\r\n\r\nSecond. Whether that spot is or is not within the territory which was\r\nwrested from Spain by the revolutionary government of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThird. Whether that spot is or is not within a settlement of people, which\r\nsettlement has existed ever since long before the Texas revolution, and\r\nuntil its inhabitants fled before the approach of the United States army.\r\n\r\nFourth. Whether that settlement is or is not isolated from any and all\r\nother settlements by the Gulf and the Rio Grande on the south and west,\r\nand by wide uninhabited regions on the north and east.\r\n\r\nFifth. Whether the people of that settlement, or a majority of them, or\r\nany of them, have ever submitted themselves to the government or laws\r\nof Texas or of the United States, by consent or by compulsion, either by\r\naccepting office, or voting at elections, or paying tax, or serving on\r\njuries, or having process served upon them, or in any other way.\r\n\r\nSixth. Whether the people of that settlement did or did not flee from the\r\napproach of the United States army, leaving unprotected their homes and\r\ntheir growing crops, before the blood was shed, as in the message stated;\r\nand whether the first blood, so shed, was or was not shed within the\r\ninclosure of one of the people who had thus fled from it.\r\n\r\nSeventh. Whether our citizens, whose blood was shed, as in his message\r\ndeclared, were or were not, at that time, armed officers and soldiers,\r\nsent into that settlement by the military order of the President, through\r\nthe Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nEighth. Whether the military force of the United States was or was not\r\nso sent into that settlement after General Taylor had more than once\r\nintimated to the War Department that, in his opinion, no such movement was\r\nnecessary to the defence or protection of Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS IN THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,\r\n\r\nJANUARY 5, 1848.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln said he had made an effort, some few days since, to obtain the\r\nfloor in relation to this measure [resolution to direct Postmaster-General\r\nto make arrangements with railroad for carrying the mails--in Committee of\r\nthe Whole], but had failed. One of the objects he had then had in view was\r\nnow in a great measure superseded by what had fallen from the gentleman\r\nfrom Virginia who had just taken his seat. He begged to assure his friends\r\non the other side of the House that no assault whatever was meant upon the\r\nPostmaster-General, and he was glad that what the gentleman had now said\r\nmodified to a great extent the impression which might have been created\r\nby the language he had used on a previous occasion. He wanted to state to\r\ngentlemen who might have entertained such impressions, that the Committee\r\non the Post-office was composed of five Whigs and four Democrats, and\r\ntheir report was understood as sustaining, not impugning, the position\r\ntaken by the Postmaster-General. That report had met with the approbation\r\nof all the Whigs, and of all the Democrats also, with the exception\r\nof one, and he wanted to go even further than this. [Intimation was\r\ninformally given Mr. Lincoln that it was not in order to mention on the\r\nfloor what had taken place in committee.] He then observed that if he had\r\nbeen out of order in what he had said he took it all back so far as he\r\ncould. He had no desire, he could assure gentlemen, ever to be out of\r\norder--though he never could keep long in order.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln went on to observe that he differed in opinion, in the present\r\ncase, from his honorable friend from Richmond [Mr. Botts]. That gentleman,\r\nhad begun his remarks by saying that if all prepossessions in this\r\nmatter could be removed out of the way, but little difficulty would be\r\nexperienced in coming to an agreement. Now, he could assure that\r\ngentleman that he had himself begun the examination of the subject with\r\nprepossessions all in his favor. He had long and often heard of him,\r\nand, from what he had heard, was prepossessed in his favor. Of the\r\nPostmaster-General he had also heard, but had no prepossessions in his\r\nfavor, though certainly none of an opposite kind. He differed, however,\r\nwith that gentleman in politics, while in this respect he agreed with the\r\ngentleman from Virginia [Mr. Botts], whom he wished to oblige whenever it\r\nwas in his power. That gentleman had referred to the report made to the\r\nHouse by the Postmaster-General, and had intimated an apprehension that\r\ngentlemen would be disposed to rely, on that report alone, and derive\r\ntheir views of the case from that document alone. Now it so happened that\r\na pamphlet had been slipped into his [Mr. Lincoln's] hand before he read\r\nthe report of the Postmaster-General; so that, even in this, he had begun\r\nwith prepossessions in favor of the gentleman from Virginia.\r\n\r\nAs to the report, he had but one remark to make: he had carefully examined\r\nit, and he did not understand that there was any dispute as to the facts\r\ntherein stated the dispute, if he understood it, was confined altogether\r\nto the inferences to be drawn from those facts. It was a difference not\r\nabout facts, but about conclusions. The facts were not disputed. If he was\r\nright in this, he supposed the House might assume the facts to be as they\r\nwere stated, and thence proceed to draw their own conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman had said that the Postmaster-General had got into a personal\r\nsquabble with the railroad company. Of this Mr. Lincoln knew nothing, nor\r\ndid he need or desire to know anything, because it had nothing whatever to\r\ndo with a just conclusion from the premises. But the gentleman had gone\r\non to ask whether so great a grievance as the present detention of the\r\nSouthern mail ought not to be remedied. Mr. Lincoln would assure the\r\ngentleman that if there was a proper way of doing it, no man was more\r\nanxious than he that it should be done. The report made by the committee\r\nhad been intended to yield much for the sake of removing that grievance.\r\nThat the grievance was very great there was no dispute in any quarter. He\r\nsupposed that the statements made by the gentleman from Virginia to show\r\nthis were all entirely correct in point of fact. He did suppose that the\r\ninterruptions of regular intercourse, and all the other inconveniences\r\ngrowing out of it, were all as that gentleman had stated them to be;\r\nand certainly, if redress could be rendered, it was proper it should be\r\nrendered as soon as possible. The gentleman said that in order to effect\r\nthis no new legislative action was needed; all that was necessary was that\r\nthe Postmaster-General should be required to do what the law, as it stood,\r\nauthorized and required him to do.\r\n\r\nWe come then, said Mr. Lincoln, to the law. Now the Postmaster-General\r\nsays he cannot give to this company more than two hundred and thirty-seven\r\ndollars and fifty cents per railroad mile of transportation, and twelve\r\nand a half per cent. less for transportation by steamboats. He considers\r\nhimself as restricted by law to this amount; and he says, further, that he\r\nwould not give more if he could, because in his apprehension it would not\r\nbe fair and just.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1848\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESIRE FOR SECOND TERM IN CONGRESS\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM H. HERNDON.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, January 8, 1848.\r\n\r\nDEAR WILLIAM:--Your letter of December 27 was received a day or two ago. I\r\nam much obliged to you for the trouble you have taken, and promise to take\r\nin my little business there. As to speech making, by way of getting\r\nthe hang of the House I made a little speech two or three days ago on\r\na post-office question of no general interest. I find speaking here and\r\nelsewhere about the same thing. I was about as badly scared, and no worse\r\nas I am when I speak in court. I expect to make one within a week or two,\r\nin which I hope to succeed well enough to wish you to see it.\r\n\r\nIt is very pleasant to learn from you that there are some who desire\r\nthat I should be reelected. I most heartily thank them for their kind\r\npartiality; and I can say, as Mr. Clay said of the annexation of Texas,\r\nthat \"personally I would not object\" to a reelection, although I thought\r\nat the time, and still think, it would be quite as well for me to return\r\nto the law at the end of a single term. I made the declaration that I\r\nwould not be a candidate again, more from a wish to deal fairly with\r\nothers, to keep peace among our friends, and to keep the district from\r\ngoing to the enemy, than for any cause personal to myself; so that if it\r\nshould so happen that nobody else wishes to be elected, I could not\r\nrefuse the people the right of sending me again. But to enter myself as\r\na competitor of others, or to authorize any one so to enter me is what my\r\nword and honor forbid.\r\n\r\nI got some letters intimating a probability of so much difficulty amongst\r\nour friends as to lose us the district; but I remember such letters were\r\nwritten to Baker when my own case was under consideration, and I trust\r\nthere is no more ground for such apprehension now than there was then.\r\nRemember I am always glad to receive a letter from you.\r\n\r\nMost truly your friend,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH ON DECLARATION OF WAR ON MEXICO\r\n\r\nSPEECH IN THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,\r\n\r\nJANUARY 12, 1848.\r\n\r\nMR CHAIRMAN:--Some if not all the gentlemen on the other side of the House\r\nwho have addressed the committee within the last two days have spoken\r\nrather complainingly, if I have rightly understood them, of the vote\r\ngiven a week or ten days ago declaring that the war with Mexico was\r\nunnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced by the President. I admit\r\nthat such a vote should not be given in mere party wantonness, and\r\nthat the one given is justly censurable if it have no other or better\r\nfoundation. I am one of those who joined in that vote; and I did so under\r\nmy best impression of the truth of the case. How I got this impression,\r\nand how it may possibly be remedied, I will now try to show. When the war\r\nbegan, it was my opinion that all those who because of knowing too little,\r\nor because of knowing too much, could not conscientiously approve the\r\nconduct of the President in the beginning of it should nevertheless, as\r\ngood citizens and patriots, remain silent on that point, at least till the\r\nwar should be ended. Some leading Democrats, including ex-President Van\r\nBuren, have taken this same view, as I understand them; and I adhered\r\nto it and acted upon it, until since I took my seat here; and I think I\r\nshould still adhere to it were it not that the President and his friends\r\nwill not allow it to be so. Besides the continual effort of the President\r\nto argue every silent vote given for supplies into an indorsement of\r\nthe justice and wisdom of his conduct; besides that singularly candid\r\nparagraph in his late message in which he tells us that Congress with\r\ngreat unanimity had declared that \"by the act of the Republic of Mexico,\r\na state of war exists between that government and the United States,\" when\r\nthe same journals that informed him of this also informed him that\r\nwhen that declaration stood disconnected from the question of supplies\r\nsixty-seven in the House, and not fourteen merely, voted against it;\r\nbesides this open attempt to prove by telling the truth what he could not\r\nprove by telling the whole truth-demanding of all who will not submit to\r\nbe misrepresented, in justice to themselves, to speak out, besides all\r\nthis, one of my colleagues [Mr. Richardson] at a very early day in the\r\nsession brought in a set of resolutions expressly indorsing the original\r\njustice of the war on the part of the President. Upon these resolutions\r\nwhen they shall be put on their passage I shall be compelled to vote; so\r\nthat I cannot be silent if I would. Seeing this, I went about preparing\r\nmyself to give the vote understandingly when it should come. I carefully\r\nexamined the President's message, to ascertain what he himself had said\r\nand proved upon the point. The result of this examination was to make the\r\nimpression that, taking for true all the President states as facts, he\r\nfalls far short of proving his justification; and that the President would\r\nhave gone further with his proof if it had not been for the small matter\r\nthat the truth would not permit him. Under the impression thus made I gave\r\nthe vote before mentioned. I propose now to give concisely the process\r\nof the examination I made, and how I reached the conclusion I did. The\r\nPresident, in his first war message of May, 1846, declares that the soil\r\nwas ours on which hostilities were commenced by Mexico, and he repeats\r\nthat declaration almost in the same language in each successive annual\r\nmessage, thus showing that he deems that point a highly essential one. In\r\nthe importance of that point I entirely agree with the President. To\r\nmy judgment it is the very point upon which he should be justified, or\r\ncondemned. In his message of December, 1846, it seems to have occurred to\r\nhim, as is certainly true, that title-ownership-to soil or anything else\r\nis not a simple fact, but is a conclusion following on one or more simple\r\nfacts; and that it was incumbent upon him to present the facts from which\r\nhe concluded the soil was ours on which the first blood of the war was\r\nshed.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, a little below the middle of page twelve in the message last\r\nreferred to, he enters upon that task; forming an issue and introducing\r\ntestimony, extending the whole to a little below the middle of page\r\nfourteen. Now, I propose to try to show that the whole of this--issue and\r\nevidence--is from beginning to end the sheerest deception. The issue, as\r\nhe presents it, is in these words: \"But there are those who, conceding all\r\nthis to be true, assume the ground that the true western boundary of Texas\r\nis the Nueces, instead of the Rio Grande; and that, therefore, in marching\r\nour army to the east bank of the latter river, we passed the Texas line\r\nand invaded the territory of Mexico.\" Now this issue is made up of two\r\naffirmatives and no negative. The main deception of it is that it assumes\r\nas true that one river or the other is necessarily the boundary; and\r\ncheats the superficial thinker entirely out of the idea that possibly\r\nthe boundary is somewhere between the two, and not actually at either. A\r\nfurther deception is that it will let in evidence which a true issue would\r\nexclude. A true issue made by the President would be about as follows: \"I\r\nsay the soil was ours, on which the first blood was shed; there are those\r\nwho say it was not.\"\r\n\r\nI now proceed to examine the President's evidence as applicable to such an\r\nissue. When that evidence is analyzed, it is all included in the following\r\npropositions:\r\n\r\n(1) That the Rio Grande was the western boundary of Louisiana as we\r\npurchased it of France in 1803.\r\n\r\n(2) That the Republic of Texas always claimed the Rio Grande as her\r\neastern boundary.\r\n\r\n(3) That by various acts she had claimed it on paper.\r\n\r\n(4) That Santa Anna in his treaty with Texas recognized the Rio Grande as\r\nher boundary.\r\n\r\n(5) That Texas before, and the United States after, annexation had\r\nexercised jurisdiction beyond the Nueces--between the two rivers.\r\n\r\n(6) That our Congress understood the boundary of Texas to extend beyond\r\nthe Nueces.\r\n\r\nNow for each of these in its turn. His first item is that the Rio Grande\r\nwas the western boundary of Louisiana, as we purchased it of France in\r\n1803; and seeming to expect this to be disputed, he argues over the amount\r\nof nearly a page to prove it true, at the end of which he lets us know\r\nthat by the treaty of 1803 we sold to Spain the whole country from the Rio\r\nGrande eastward to the Sabine. Now, admitting for the present that the\r\nRio Grande was the boundary of Louisiana, what under heaven had that to\r\ndo with the present boundary between us and Mexico? How, Mr. Chairman,\r\nthe line that once divided your land from mine can still be the\r\nboundary between us after I have sold my land to you is to me beyond all\r\ncomprehension. And how any man, with an honest purpose only of proving the\r\ntruth, could ever have thought of introducing such a fact to prove such an\r\nissue is equally incomprehensible. His next piece of evidence is that \"the\r\nRepublic of Texas always claimed this river [Rio Grande] as her western\r\nboundary.\" That is not true, in fact. Texas has claimed it, but she has\r\nnot always claimed it. There is at least one distinguished exception. Her\r\nState constitution the republic's most solemn and well-considered\r\nact, that which may, without impropriety, be called her last will and\r\ntestament, revoking all others-makes no such claim. But suppose she had\r\nalways claimed it. Has not Mexico always claimed the contrary? So that\r\nthere is but claim against claim, leaving nothing proved until we get back\r\nof the claims and find which has the better foundation. Though not in the\r\norder in which the President presents his evidence, I now consider that\r\nclass of his statements which are in substance nothing more than that\r\nTexas has, by various acts of her Convention and Congress, claimed the\r\nRio Grande as her boundary, on paper. I mean here what he says about the\r\nfixing of the Rio Grande as her boundary in her old constitution (not her\r\nState constitution), about forming Congressional districts, counties, etc.\r\nNow all of this is but naked claim; and what I have already said about\r\nclaims is strictly applicable to this. If I should claim your land by word\r\nof mouth, that certainly would not make it mine; and if I were to claim it\r\nby a deed which I had made myself, and with which you had had nothing to\r\ndo, the claim would be quite the same in substance--or rather, in utter\r\nnothingness. I next consider the President's statement that Santa Anna in\r\nhis treaty with Texas recognized the Rio Grande as the western boundary\r\nof Texas. Besides the position so often taken, that Santa Anna while a\r\nprisoner of war, a captive, could not bind Mexico by a treaty, which I\r\ndeem conclusive--besides this, I wish to say something in relation to this\r\ntreaty, so called by the President, with Santa Anna. If any man would like\r\nto be amused by a sight of that little thing which the President calls by\r\nthat big name, he can have it by turning to Niles's Register, vol. 1,\r\np. 336. And if any one should suppose that Niles's Register is a curious\r\nrepository of so mighty a document as a solemn treaty between nations, I\r\ncan only say that I learned to a tolerable degree of certainty, by inquiry\r\nat the State Department, that the President himself never saw it anywhere\r\nelse. By the way, I believe I should not err if I were to declare that\r\nduring the first ten years of the existence of that document it was\r\nnever by anybody called a treaty--that it was never so called till the\r\nPresident, in his extremity, attempted by so calling it to wring something\r\nfrom it in justification of himself in connection with the Mexican War.\r\nIt has none of the distinguishing features of a treaty. It does not call\r\nitself a treaty. Santa Anna does not therein assume to bind Mexico; he\r\nassumes only to act as the President--Commander-in-Chief of the Mexican\r\narmy and navy; stipulates that the then present hostilities should cease,\r\nand that he would not himself take up arms, nor influence the Mexican\r\npeople to take up arms, against Texas during the existence of the war of\r\nindependence. He did not recognize the independence of Texas; he did not\r\nassume to put an end to the war, but clearly indicated his expectation\r\nof its continuance; he did not say one word about boundary, and, most\r\nprobably, never thought of it. It is stipulated therein that the Mexican\r\nforces should evacuate the territory of Texas, passing to the other\r\nside of the Rio Grande; and in another article it is stipulated that, to\r\nprevent collisions between the armies, the Texas army should not approach\r\nnearer than within five leagues--of what is not said, but clearly, from\r\nthe object stated, it is of the Rio Grande. Now, if this is a treaty\r\nrecognizing the Rio Grande as the boundary of Texas, it contains the\r\nsingular feature of stipulating that Texas shall not go within five\r\nleagues of her own boundary.\r\n\r\nNext comes the evidence of Texas before annexation, and the United States\r\nafterwards, exercising jurisdiction beyond the Nueces and between the two\r\nrivers. This actual exercise of jurisdiction is the very class or quality\r\nof evidence we want. It is excellent so far as it goes; but does it go far\r\nenough? He tells us it went beyond the Nueces, but he does not tell us it\r\nwent to the Rio Grande. He tells us jurisdiction was exercised between\r\nthe two rivers, but he does not tell us it was exercised over all the\r\nterritory between them. Some simple-minded people think it is possible to\r\ncross one river and go beyond it without going all the way to the next,\r\nthat jurisdiction may be exercised between two rivers without covering\r\nall the country between them. I know a man, not very unlike myself, who\r\nexercises jurisdiction over a piece of land between the Wabash and the\r\nMississippi; and yet so far is this from being all there is between those\r\nrivers that it is just one hundred and fifty-two feet long by fifty feet\r\nwide, and no part of it much within a hundred miles of either. He has a\r\nneighbor between him and the Mississippi--that is, just across the street,\r\nin that direction--whom I am sure he could neither persuade nor force to\r\ngive up his habitation; but which nevertheless he could certainly annex,\r\nif it were to be done by merely standing on his own side of the street and\r\nclaiming it, or even sitting down and writing a deed for it.\r\n\r\nBut next the President tells us the Congress of the United States\r\nunderstood the State of Texas they admitted into the Union to extend\r\nbeyond the Nueces. Well, I suppose they did. I certainly so understood it.\r\nBut how far beyond? That Congress did not understand it to extend clear\r\nto the Rio Grande is quite certain, by the fact of their joint resolutions\r\nfor admission expressly leaving all questions of boundary to future\r\nadjustment. And it may be added that Texas herself is proven to have had\r\nthe same understanding of it that our Congress had, by the fact of the\r\nexact conformity of her new constitution to those resolutions.\r\n\r\nI am now through the whole of the President's evidence; and it is a\r\nsingular fact that if any one should declare the President sent the army\r\ninto the midst of a settlement of Mexican people who had never submitted,\r\nby consent or by force, to the authority of Texas or of the United States,\r\nand that there and thereby the first blood of the war was shed, there is\r\nnot one word in all the which would either admit or deny the declaration.\r\nThis strange omission it does seem to me could not have occurred but by\r\ndesign. My way of living leads me to be about the courts of justice; and\r\nthere I have sometimes seen a good lawyer, struggling for his client's\r\nneck in a desperate case, employing every artifice to work round, befog,\r\nand cover up with many words some point arising in the case which he dared\r\nnot admit and yet could not deny. Party bias may help to make it appear\r\nso, but with all the allowance I can make for such bias, it still\r\ndoes appear to me that just such, and from just such necessity, is the\r\nPresident's struggle in this case.\r\n\r\nSometime after my colleague [Mr. Richardson] introduced the resolutions I\r\nhave mentioned, I introduced a preamble, resolution, and interrogations,\r\nintended to draw the President out, if possible, on this hitherto\r\nuntrodden ground. To show their relevancy, I propose to state my\r\nunderstanding of the true rule for ascertaining the boundary between Texas\r\nand Mexico. It is that wherever Texas was exercising jurisdiction was\r\nhers; and wherever Mexico was exercising jurisdiction was hers; and that\r\nwhatever separated the actual exercise of jurisdiction of the one from\r\nthat of the other was the true boundary between them. If, as is probably\r\ntrue, Texas was exercising jurisdiction along the western bank of the\r\nNueces, and Mexico was exercising it along the eastern bank of the Rio\r\nGrande, then neither river was the boundary: but the uninhabited country\r\nbetween the two was. The extent of our territory in that region depended\r\nnot on any treaty-fixed boundary (for no treaty had attempted it), but on\r\nrevolution. Any people anywhere being inclined and having the power have\r\nthe right to rise up and shake off the existing government, and form a\r\nnew one that suits them better. This is a most valuable, a most sacred\r\nright--a right which we hope and believe is to liberate the world. Nor\r\nis this right confined to cases in which the whole people of an existing\r\ngovernment may choose to exercise it. Any portion of such people that can\r\nmay revolutionize and make their own of so much of the territory as they\r\ninhabit. More than this, a majority of any portion of such people may\r\nrevolutionize, putting down a minority, intermingled with or near about\r\nthem, who may oppose this movement. Such minority was precisely the case\r\nof the Tories of our own revolution. It is a quality of revolutions not to\r\ngo by old lines or old laws, but to break up both, and make new ones.\r\n\r\nAs to the country now in question, we bought it of France in 1803, and\r\nsold it to Spain in 1819, according to the President's statements. After\r\nthis, all Mexico, including Texas, revolutionized against Spain; and still\r\nlater Texas revolutionized against Mexico. In my view, just so far as\r\nshe carried her resolution by obtaining the actual, willing or unwilling,\r\nsubmission of the people, so far the country was hers, and no farther.\r\nNow, sir, for the purpose of obtaining the very best evidence as to\r\nwhether Texas had actually carried her revolution to the place where the\r\nhostilities of the present war commenced, let the President answer the\r\ninterrogatories I proposed, as before mentioned, or some other similar\r\nones. Let him answer fully, fairly, and candidly. Let him answer with\r\nfacts and not with arguments. Let him remember he sits where Washington\r\nsat, and so remembering, let him answer as Washington would answer. As\r\na nation should not, and the Almighty will not, be evaded, so let him\r\nattempt no evasion--no equivocation. And if, so answering, he can show\r\nthat the soil was ours where the first blood of the war was shed,--that\r\nit was not within an inhabited country, or, if within such, that the\r\ninhabitants had submitted themselves to the civil authority of Texas or\r\nof the United States, and that the same is true of the site of Fort Brown,\r\nthen I am with him for his justification. In that case I shall be most\r\nhappy to reverse the vote I gave the other day. I have a selfish motive\r\nfor desiring that the President may do this--I expect to gain some votes,\r\nin connection with the war, which, without his so doing, will be of\r\ndoubtful propriety in my own judgment, but which will be free from the\r\ndoubt if he does so. But if he can not or will not do this,--if on any\r\npretence or no pretence he shall refuse or omit it then I shall be fully\r\nconvinced of what I more than suspect already that he is deeply conscious\r\nof being in the wrong; that he feels the blood of this war, like the blood\r\nof Abel, is crying to heaven against him; that originally having some\r\nstrong motive--what, I will not stop now to give my opinion concerning\r\nto involve the two countries in a war, and trusting to escape scrutiny\r\nby fixing the public gaze upon the exceeding brightness of military\r\nglory,--that attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood, that\r\nserpent's eye that charms to destroy,--he plunged into it, and was swept\r\non and on till, disappointed in his calculation of the ease with which\r\nMexico might be subdued, he now finds himself he knows not where. How like\r\nthe half insane mumbling of a fever dream is the whole war part of his\r\nlate message! At one time telling us that Mexico has nothing whatever that\r\nwe can get--but territory; at another showing us how we can support the\r\nwar by levying contributions on Mexico. At one time urging the national\r\nhonor, the security of the future, the prevention of foreign interference,\r\nand even the good of Mexico herself as among the objects of the war; at\r\nanother telling us that \"to reject indemnity, by refusing to accept a\r\ncession of territory, would be to abandon all our just demands, and to\r\nwage the war, bearing all its expenses, without a purpose or definite\r\nobject.\" So then this national honor, security of the future, and\r\neverything but territorial indemnity may be considered the no-purposes and\r\nindefinite objects of the war! But, having it now settled that territorial\r\nindemnity is the only object, we are urged to seize, by legislation here,\r\nall that he was content to take a few months ago, and the whole province\r\nof Lower California to boot, and to still carry on the war to take all\r\nwe are fighting for, and still fight on. Again, the President is resolved\r\nunder all circumstances to have full territorial indemnity for the\r\nexpenses of the war; but he forgets to tell us how we are to get the\r\nexcess after those expenses shall have surpassed the value of the whole\r\nof the Mexican territory. So again, he insists that the separate national\r\nexistence of Mexico shall be maintained; but he does not tell us how\r\nthis can be done, after we shall have taken all her territory. Lest the\r\nquestions I have suggested be considered speculative merely, let me be\r\nindulged a moment in trying to show they are not. The war has gone on some\r\ntwenty months; for the expenses of which, together with an inconsiderable\r\nold score, the President now claims about one half of the Mexican\r\nterritory, and that by far the better half, so far as concerns our ability\r\nto make anything out of it. It is comparatively uninhabited; so that we\r\ncould establish land-offices in it, and raise some money in that way. But\r\nthe other half is already inhabited, as I understand it, tolerably\r\ndensely for the nature of the country, and all its lands, or all that are\r\nvaluable, already appropriated as private property. How then are we to\r\nmake anything out of these lands with this encumbrance on them? or how\r\nremove the encumbrance? I suppose no one would say we should kill the\r\npeople, or drive them out, or make slaves of them, or confiscate their\r\nproperty. How, then, can we make much out of this part of the territory?\r\nIf the prosecution of the war has in expenses already equalled the better\r\nhalf of the country, how long its future prosecution will be in equalling\r\nthe less valuable half is not a speculative, but a practical, question,\r\npressing closely upon us. And yet it is a question which the President\r\nseems never to have thought of. As to the mode of terminating the war and\r\nsecuring peace, the President is equally wandering and indefinite. First,\r\nit is to be done by a more vigorous prosecution of the war in the vital\r\nparts of the enemy's country; and after apparently talking himself tired\r\non this point, the President drops down into a half-despairing tone,\r\nand tells us that \"with a people distracted and divided by contending\r\nfactions, and a government subject to constant changes by successive\r\nrevolutions, the continued success of our arms may fail to secure a\r\nsatisfactory peace.\" Then he suggests the propriety of wheedling the\r\nMexican people to desert the counsels of their own leaders, and, trusting\r\nin our protestations, to set up a government from which we can secure\r\na satisfactory peace; telling us that \"this may become the only mode of\r\nobtaining such a peace.\" But soon he falls into doubt of this too; and\r\nthen drops back on to the already half-abandoned ground of \"more vigorous\r\nprosecution.\" All this shows that the President is in nowise satisfied\r\nwith his own positions. First he takes up one, and in attempting to argue\r\nus into it he argues himself out of it, then seizes another and goes\r\nthrough the same process, and then, confused at being able to think of\r\nnothing new, he snatches up the old one again, which he has some time\r\nbefore cast off. His mind, taxed beyond its power, is running hither and\r\nthither, like some tortured creature on a burning surface, finding no\r\nposition on which it can settle down and be at ease.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is a singular omission in this message that it nowhere intimates\r\nwhen the President expects the war to terminate. At its beginning, General\r\nScott was by this same President driven into disfavor if not disgrace, for\r\nintimating that peace could not be conquered in less than three or four\r\nmonths. But now, at the end of about twenty months, during which time our\r\narms have given us the most splendid successes, every department and every\r\npart, land and water, officers and privates, regulars and volunteers,\r\ndoing all that men could do, and hundreds of things which it had ever\r\nbefore been thought men could not do--after all this, this same President\r\ngives a long message, without showing us that as to the end he himself has\r\neven an imaginary conception. As I have before said, he knows not where he\r\nis. He is a bewildered, confounded, and miserably perplexed man. God grant\r\nhe may be able to show there is not something about his conscience more\r\npainful than his mental perplexity.\r\n\r\nThe following is a copy of the so-called \"treaty\" referred to in the\r\nspeech:\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Articles of Agreement entered into between his Excellency\r\nDavid G. Burnet, President of the Republic of Texas, of the one part,\r\nand his Excellency General Santa Anna, President-General-in-Chief of the\r\nMexican army, of the other part:\r\n\r\n   \"Article I. General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna agrees that\r\nhe will not take up arms, nor will he exercise his influence to cause\r\nthem to be taken up, against the people of Texas during the present war of\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\n   \"Article II. All hostilities between the Mexican and Texan\r\ntroops will cease immediately, both by land and water.\r\n\r\n   \"Article III. The Mexican troops will evacuate the territory\r\nof Texas, passing to the other side of the Rio Grande Del Norte.\r\n\r\n   \"Article IV. The Mexican army, in its retreat, shall not\r\ntake the property of any person without his consent and just\r\nindemnification, using only such articles as may be necessary for its\r\nsubsistence, in cases when the owner may not be present, and remitting\r\nto the commander of the army of Texas, or to the commissioners to be\r\nappointed for the adjustment of such matters, an account of the value of\r\nthe property consumed, the place where taken, and the name of the owner,\r\nif it can be ascertained.\r\n\r\n   \"Article V. That all private property, including cattle,\r\nhorses, negro slaves, or indentured persons, of whatever denomination,\r\nthat may have been captured by any portion of the Mexican army, or may\r\nhave taken refuge in the said army, since the commencement of the late\r\ninvasion, shall be restored to the commander of the Texan army, or to such\r\nother persons as may be appointed by the Government of Texas to receive\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n   \"Article VI. The troops of both armies will refrain from\r\ncoming in contact with each other; and to this end the commander of the\r\narmy of Texas will be careful not to approach within a shorter distance\r\nthan five leagues.\r\n\r\n   \"Article VII. The Mexican army shall not make any other\r\ndelay on its march than that which is necessary to take up their\r\nhospitals, baggage, etc., and to cross the rivers; any delay not necessary\r\nto these purposes to be considered an infraction of this agreement.\r\n\r\n   \"Article VIII.

GRAYSON, Attorney-General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, JANUARY 19, 1848.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln, from the Committee on the Post-office and Post Roads, made\r\nthe following report:\r\n\r\nThe Committee on the Post-office and Post Roads, to whom was referred the\r\npetition of Messrs. Saltmarsh and Fuller, report: That, as proved to\r\ntheir satisfaction, the mail routes from Milledgeville to Athens, and from\r\nWarrenton to Decatur, in the State of Georgia (numbered 2366 and 2380),\r\nwere let to Reeside and Avery at $1300 per annum for the former and $1500\r\nfor the latter, for the term of four years, to commence on the first day\r\nof January, 1835; that, previous to the time for commencing the service,\r\nReeside sold his interest therein to Avery; that on the 5th of May, 1835,\r\nAvery sold the whole to these petitioners, Saltmarsh and Fuller, to\r\ntake effect from the beginning, January a 1835; that at this time, the\r\nAssistant Postmaster-General, being called on for that purpose, consented\r\nto the transfer of the contracts from Reeside and Avery to these\r\npetitioners, and promised to have proper entries of the transfer made on\r\nthe books of the department, which, however, was neglected to be done;\r\nthat the petitioners, supposing all was right, in good faith commenced the\r\ntransportation of the mail on these routes, and after difficulty arose,\r\nstill trusting that all would be made right, continued the service\r\ntill December a 1837; that they performed the service to the entire\r\nsatisfaction of the department, and have never been paid anything for it\r\nexcept $----; that the difficulty occurred as follows:\r\n\r\nMr. Barry was Postmaster-General at the times of making the contracts\r\nand the attempted transfer of them; Mr. Kendall succeeded Mr. Barry, and\r\nfinding Reeside apparently in debt to the department, and these contracts\r\nstill standing in the names of Reeside and Avery, refused to pay for the\r\nservices under them, otherwise than by credits to Reeside; afterward,\r\nhowever, he divided the compensation, still crediting one half to Reeside,\r\nand directing the other to be paid to the order of Avery, who disclaimed\r\nall right to it. After discontinuing the service, these petitioners,\r\nsupposing they might have legal redress against Avery, brought suit\r\nagainst him in New Orleans; in which suit they failed, on the ground\r\nthat Avery had complied with his contract, having done so much toward the\r\ntransfer as they had accepted and been satisfied with. Still later the\r\ndepartment sued Reeside on his supposed indebtedness, and by a verdict of\r\nthe jury it was determined that the department was indebted to him in a\r\nsum much beyond all the credits given him on the account above stated.\r\nUnder these circumstances, the committee consider the petitioners clearly\r\nentitled to relief, and they report a bill accordingly; lest, however,\r\nthere should be some mistake as to the amount which they have already\r\nreceived, we so frame it as that, by adjustment at the department, they\r\nmay be paid so much as remains unpaid for services actually performed by\r\nthem not charging them with the credits given to Reeside. The committee\r\nthink it not improbable that the petitioners purchased the right of Avery\r\nto be paid for the service from the 1st of January, till their purchase\r\non May 11, 1835; but, the evidence on this point being very vague, they\r\nforbear to report in favor of allowing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM H. HERNDON--LEGAL WORK\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, January 19, 1848.\r\n\r\nDEAR WILLIAM:--Inclosed you find a letter of Louis W. Chandler. What\r\nis wanted is that you shall ascertain whether the claim upon the note\r\ndescribed has received any dividend in the Probate Court of Christian\r\nCounty, where the estate of Mr. Overbon Williams has been administered\r\non. If nothing is paid on it, withdraw the note and send it to me, so that\r\nChandler can see the indorser of it. At all events write me all about it,\r\ntill I can somehow get it off my hands. I have already been bored more\r\nthan enough about it; not the least of which annoyance is his cursed,\r\nunreadable, and ungodly handwriting.\r\n\r\nI have made a speech, a copy of which I will send you by next mail.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGARDING SPEECH ON MEXICAN WAR\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM H. HERNDON.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, February 1, 1848.\r\n\r\nDEAR WILLIAM:--Your letter of the 19th ultimo was received last night, and\r\nfor which I am much obliged. The only thing in it that I wish to talk to\r\nyou at once about is that because of my vote for Ashmun's amendment you\r\nfear that you and I disagree about the war. I regret this, not because of\r\nany fear we shall remain disagreed after you have read this letter, but\r\nbecause if you misunderstand I fear other good friends may also. That vote\r\naffirms that the war was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced by\r\nthe President; and I will stake my life that if you had been in my place\r\nyou would have voted just as I did. Would you have voted what you felt\r\nand knew to be a lie? I know you would not. Would you have gone out of the\r\nHouse--skulked the vote? I expect not. If you had skulked one vote,\r\nyou would have had to skulk many more before the end of the session.\r\nRichardson's resolutions, introduced before I made any move or gave any\r\nvote upon the subject, make the direct question of the justice of the war;\r\nso that no man can be silent if he would. You are compelled to speak; and\r\nyour only alternative is to tell the truth or a lie. I cannot doubt which\r\nyou would do.\r\n\r\nThis vote has nothing to do in determining my votes on the questions of\r\nsupplies. I have always intended, and still intend, to vote supplies;\r\nperhaps not in the precise form recommended by the President, but in a\r\nbetter form for all purposes, except Locofoco party purposes. It is in\r\nthis particular you seem mistaken. The Locos are untiring in their efforts\r\nto make the impression that all who vote supplies or take part in the war\r\ndo of necessity approve the President's conduct in the beginning of\r\nit; but the Whigs have from the beginning made and kept the distinction\r\nbetween the two. In the very first act nearly all the Whigs voted against\r\nthe preamble declaring that war existed by the act of Mexico; and yet\r\nnearly all of them voted for the supplies. As to the Whig men who have\r\nparticipated in the war, so far as they have spoken in my hearing they\r\ndo not hesitate to denounce as unjust the President's conduct in the\r\nbeginning of the war. They do not suppose that such denunciation is\r\ndirected by undying hatred to him, as The Register would have it believed.\r\nThere are two such Whigs on this floor (Colonel Haskell and Major James)\r\nThe former fought as a colonel by the side of Colonel Baker at Cerro\r\nGordo, and stands side by side with me in the vote that you seem\r\ndissatisfied with. The latter, the history of whose capture with Cassius\r\nClay you well know, had not arrived here when that vote was given; but,\r\nas I understand, he stands ready to give just such a vote whenever an\r\noccasion shall present. Baker, too, who is now here, says the truth is\r\nundoubtedly that way; and whenever he shall speak out, he will say so.\r\nColonel Doniphan, too, the favorite Whig of Missouri, and who overran\r\nall Northern Mexico, on his return home in a public speech at St. Louis\r\ncondemned the administration in relation to the war. If I remember, G. T.\r\nM. Davis, who has been through almost the whole war, declares in favor of\r\nMr. Clay; from which I infer that he adopts the sentiments of Mr. Clay,\r\ngenerally at least. On the other hand, I have heard of but one Whig who\r\nhas been to the war attempting to justify the President's conduct. That\r\none was Captain Bishop, editor of the Charleston Courier, and a very\r\nclever fellow. I do not mean this letter for the public, but for you.\r\nBefore it reaches you, you will have seen and read my pamphlet speech,\r\nand perhaps been scared anew by it. After you get over your scare, read it\r\nover again, sentence by sentence, and tell me honestly what you think of\r\nit. I condensed all I could for fear of being cut off by the hour rule,\r\nand when I got through I had spoken but forty-five minutes.\r\n\r\nYours forever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM H. HERNDON.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, February 2, 1848\r\n\r\nDEAR WILLIAM:--I just take my pen to say that Mr. Stephens, of Georgia, a\r\nlittle, slim, pale-faced, consumptive man, with a voice like Logan's, has\r\njust concluded the very best speech of an hour's length I ever heard. My\r\nold withered dry eyes are full of tears yet.\r\n\r\nIf he writes it out anything like he delivered it, our people shall see a\r\ngood many copies of it.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE MEXICAN WAR\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM H. HERNDON.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, February 15, 1848.\r\n\r\nDEAR WILLIAM:--Your letter of the 29th January was received last night.\r\nBeing exclusively a constitutional argument, I wish to submit some\r\nreflections upon it in the same spirit of kindness that I know actuates\r\nyou. Let me first state what I understand to be your position. It is that\r\nif it shall become necessary to repel invasion, the President may, without\r\nviolation of the Constitution, cross the line and invade the territory of\r\nanother country, and that whether such necessity exists in any given case\r\nthe President is the sole judge.\r\n\r\nBefore going further consider well whether this is or is not your\r\nposition. If it is, it is a position that neither the President himself,\r\nnor any friend of his, so far as I know, has ever taken. Their only\r\npositions are--first, that the soil was ours when the hostilities\r\ncommenced; and second, that whether it was rightfully ours or not,\r\nCongress had annexed it, and the President for that reason was bound to\r\ndefend it; both of which are as clearly proved to be false in fact as you\r\ncan prove that your house is mine. The soil was not ours, and Congress did\r\nnot annex or attempt to annex it. But to return to your position. Allow\r\nthe President to invade a neighboring nation whenever he shall deem it\r\nnecessary to repel an invasion, and you allow him to do so whenever he may\r\nchoose to say he deems it necessary for such purpose, and you allow him to\r\nmake war at pleasure. Study to see if you can fix any limit to his power\r\nin this respect, after having given him so much as you propose. If to-day\r\nhe should choose to say he thinks it necessary to invade Canada to prevent\r\nthe British from invading us, how could you stop him? You may say to\r\nhim,--\"I see no probability of the British invading us\"; but he will say\r\nto you, \"Be silent: I see it, if you don't.\"\r\n\r\nThe provision of the Constitution giving the war making power to Congress\r\nwas dictated, as I understand it, by the following reasons: kings had\r\nalways been involving and impoverishing their people in wars, pretending\r\ngenerally, if not always, that the good of the people was the object.\r\nThis our convention understood to be the most oppressive of all kingly\r\noppressions, and they resolved to so frame the Constitution that no one\r\nman should hold the power of bringing this oppression upon us. But your\r\nview destroys the whole matter, and places our President where kings have\r\nalways stood. Write soon again.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,\r\n\r\nMARCH 9, 1848.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln, from the Committee on the Postoffice and Post Roads, made the\r\nfollowing report:\r\n\r\nThe Committee on the Post-office and Post Roads, to whom was referred the\r\nresolution of the House of Representatives entitled \"An Act authorizing\r\npostmasters at county seats of justice to receive subscriptions for\r\nnewspapers and periodicals, to be paid through the agency of the\r\nPost-office Department, and for other purposes,\" beg leave to submit the\r\nfollowing report:\r\n\r\nThe committee have reason to believe that a general wish pervades the\r\ncommunity at large that some such facility as the proposed measure should\r\nbe granted by express law, for subscribing, through the agency of the\r\nPost-office Department, to newspapers and periodicals which diffuse daily,\r\nweekly, or monthly intelligence of passing events. Compliance with\r\nthis general wish is deemed to be in accordance with our republican\r\ninstitutions, which can be best sustained by the diffusion of knowledge\r\nand the due encouragement of a universal, national spirit of inquiry and\r\ndiscussion of public events through the medium of the public press. The\r\ncommittee, however, has not been insensible to its duty of guarding the\r\nPost-office Department against injurious sacrifices for the accomplishment\r\nof this object, whereby its ordinary efficacy might be impaired or\r\nembarrassed. It has therefore been a subject of much consideration; but\r\nit is now confidently hoped that the bill herewith submitted effectually\r\nobviates all objections which might exist with regard to a less matured\r\nproposition.\r\n\r\nThe committee learned, upon inquiry, that the Post-office Department,\r\nin view of meeting the general wish on this subject, made the experiment\r\nthrough one if its own internal regulations, when the new postage system\r\nwent into operation on the first of July, 1845, and that it was continued\r\nuntil the thirtieth of September, 1847. But this experiment, for reasons\r\nhereafter stated, proved unsatisfactory, and it was discontinued by\r\norder of the Postmaster-General. As far as the committee can at present\r\nascertain, the following seem to have been the principal grounds of\r\ndissatisfaction in this experiment:\r\n\r\n(1) The legal responsibility of postmasters receiving newspaper\r\nsubscriptions, or of their sureties, was not defined.\r\n\r\n(2) The authority was open to all postmasters instead of being limited to\r\nthose of specific offices.\r\n\r\n(3) The consequence of this extension of authority was that, in\r\ninnumerable instances, the money, without the previous knowledge or\r\ncontrol of the officers of the department who are responsible for the good\r\nmanagement of its finances, was deposited in offices where it was improper\r\nsuch funds should be placed; and the repayment was ordered, not by\r\nthe financial officers, but by the postmasters, at points where it was\r\ninconvenient to the department so to disburse its funds.\r\n\r\n(4) The inconvenience of accumulating uncertain and fluctuating sums at\r\nsmall offices was felt seriously in consequent overpayments to contractors\r\non their quarterly collecting orders; and, in case of private mail routes,\r\nin litigation concerning the misapplication of such funds to the special\r\nservice of supplying mails.\r\n\r\n(5) The accumulation of such funds on draft offices could not be known\r\nto the financial clerks of the department in time to control it, and too\r\noften this rendered uncertain all their calculations of funds in hand.\r\n\r\n(6) The orders of payment were for the most part issued upon the principal\r\noffices, such as New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore, etc., where\r\nthe large offices of publishers are located, causing an illimitable and\r\nuncontrollable drain of the department funds from those points where\r\nit was essential to husband them for its own regular disbursements. In\r\nPhiladelphia alone this drain averaged $5000 per quarter; and in other\r\ncities of the seaboard it was proportionate.\r\n\r\n(7) The embarrassment of the department was increased by the illimitable,\r\nuncontrollable, and irresponsible scattering of its funds from\r\nconcentrated points suitable for its distributions, to remote, unsafe, and\r\ninconvenient offices, where they could not be again made available till\r\ncollected by special agents, or were transferred at considerable expense\r\ninto the principal disbursing offices again.\r\n\r\n(8) There was a vast increase of duties thrown upon the limited force\r\nbefore necessary to conduct the business of the department; and from the\r\ndelay of obtaining vouchers impediments arose to the speedy settlement of\r\naccounts with present or retired post-masters, causing postponements which\r\nendangered the liability of sureties under the act of limitations, and\r\ncausing much danger of an increase of such cases.\r\n\r\n(9) The most responsible postmasters (at the large offices) were ordered\r\nby the least responsible (at small offices) to make payments upon their\r\nvouchers, without having the means of ascertaining whether these vouchers\r\nwere genuine or forged, or if genuine, whether the signers were in or out\r\nof office, or solvent or defaulters.\r\n\r\n(10) The transaction of this business for subscribers and publishers at\r\nthe public expense, an the embarrassment, inconvenience, and delay of\r\nthe department's own business occasioned by it, were not justified by any\r\nsufficient remuneration of revenue to sustain the department, as required\r\nin every other respect with regard to its agency.\r\n\r\nThe committee, in view of these objections, has been solicitous to frame\r\na bill which would not be obnoxious to them in principle or in practical\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nIt is confidently believed that by limiting the offices for receiving\r\nsubscriptions to less than one tenth of the number authorized by the\r\nexperiment already tried, and designating the county seat in each\r\ncounty for the purpose, the control of the department will be rendered\r\nsatisfactory; particularly as it will be in the power of the Auditor,\r\nwho is the officer required by law to check the accounts, to approve or\r\ndisapprove of the deposits, and to sanction not only the payments, but to\r\npoint out the place of payment. If these payments should cause a drain\r\non the principal offices of the seaboard, it will be compensated by the\r\naccumulation of funds at county seats, where the contractors on those\r\nroutes can be paid to that extent by the department's drafts, with more\r\nlocal convenience to themselves than by drafts on the seaboard offices.\r\n\r\nThe legal responsibility for these deposits is defined, and the\r\naccumulation of funds at the point of deposit, and the repayment at\r\npoints drawn upon, being known to and controlled by the Auditor, will not\r\noccasion any such embarrassments as were before felt; the record kept\r\nby the Auditor on the passing of the certificates through his hands will\r\nenable him to settle accounts without the delay occasioned by vouchers\r\nbeing withheld; all doubt or uncertainty as to the genuineness of\r\ncertificates, or the propriety of their issue, will be removed by the\r\nAuditor's examination and approval; and there can be no risk of loss\r\nof funds by transmission, as the certificate will not be payable till\r\nsanctioned by the Auditor, and after his sanction the payor need not pay\r\nit unless it is presented by the publisher or his known clerk or agent.\r\n\r\nThe main principle of equivalent for the agency of the department is\r\nsecured by the postage required to be paid upon the transmission of the\r\ncertificates, augmenting adequately the post-office revenue.\r\n\r\nThe committee, conceiving that in this report all the difficulties of the\r\nsubject have been fully and fairly stated, and that these difficulties\r\nhave been obviated by the plan proposed in the accompanying bill, and\r\nbelieving that the measure will satisfactorily meet the wants and wishes\r\nof a very large portion of the community, beg leave to recommend its\r\nadoption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,\r\n\r\nMARCH 9, 1848.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln, from the Committee on the Postoffice and Post Roads, made the\r\nfollowing report:\r\n\r\nThe Committee on the Post-office and Post Roads, to whom was referred\r\nthe petition of H. M. Barney, postmaster at Brimfield, Peoria County,\r\nIllinois, report: That they have been satisfied by evidence, that on the\r\n15th of December, 1847, said petitioner had his store, with some fifteen\r\nhundred dollars' worth of goods, together with all the papers of the\r\npost-office, entirely destroyed by fire; and that the specie funds of the\r\noffice were melted down, partially lost and partially destroyed; that this\r\nlarge individual loss entirely precludes the idea of embezzlement; that\r\nthe balances due the department of former quarters had been only about\r\ntwenty-five dollars; and that owing to the destruction of papers, the\r\nexact amount due for the quarter ending December 31, 1847, cannot be\r\nascertained. They therefore report a joint resolution, releasing said\r\npetitioner from paying anything for the quarter last mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS IN THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, MARCH 29, 1848.\r\n\r\nThe bill for raising additional military force for limited time, etc., was\r\nreported from Committee on judiciary; similar bills had been reported from\r\nCommittee on, Public Lands and Military Committee.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln said if there was a general desire on the part of the House to\r\npass the bill now he should be glad to have it done--concurring, as he\r\ndid generally, with the gentleman from Arkansas [Mr. Johnson] that the\r\npostponement might jeopard the safety of the proposition. If, however, a\r\nreference was to be made, he wished to make a very few remarks in relation\r\nto the several subjects desired by the gentlemen to be embraced in\r\namendments to the ninth section of the act of the last session of\r\nCongress. The first amendment desired by members of this House had for its\r\nonly object to give bounty lands to such persons as had served for a time\r\nas privates, but had never been discharged as such, because promoted to\r\noffice. That subject, and no other, was embraced in this bill. There were\r\nsome others who desired, while they were legislating on this subject, that\r\nthey should also give bounty lands to the volunteers of the War of 1812.\r\nHis friend from Maryland said there were no such men. He [Mr. L.] did not\r\nsay there were many, but he was very confident there were some. His friend\r\nfrom Kentucky near him, [Mr. Gaines] told him he himself was one.\r\n\r\nThere was still another proposition touching this matter; that was, that\r\npersons entitled to bounty lands should by law be entitled to locate these\r\nlands in parcels, and not be required to locate them in one body, as was\r\nprovided by the existing law.\r\n\r\nNow he had carefully drawn up a bill embracing these three separate\r\npropositions, which he intended to propose as a substitute for all these\r\nbills in the House, or in Committee of the Whole on the State of the\r\nUnion, at some suitable time. If there was a disposition on the part of\r\nthe House to act at once on this separate proposition, he repeated that,\r\nwith the gentlemen from Arkansas, he should prefer it lest they should\r\nlose all. But if there was to be a reference, he desired to introduce his\r\nbill embracing the three propositions, thus enabling the committee and the\r\nHouse to act at the same time, whether favorably or unfavorably, upon all.\r\nHe inquired whether an amendment was now in order.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker replied in the negative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ARCHIBALD WILLIAMS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, April 30, 1848.\r\n\r\nDEAR WILLIAMS:--I have not seen in the papers any evidence of a movement\r\nto send a delegate from your circuit to the June convention. I wish to say\r\nthat I think it all-important that a delegate should be sent. Mr. Clay's\r\nchance for an election is just no chance at all. He might get New York,\r\nand that would have elected in 1844, but it will not now, because he must\r\nnow, at the least, lose Tennessee, which he had then, and in addition the\r\nfifteen new votes of Florida, Texas, Iowa, and Wisconsin. I know our good\r\nfriend Browning is a great admirer of Mr. Clay, and I therefore fear he is\r\nfavoring his nomination. If he is, ask him to discard feeling, and try\r\nif he can possibly, as a matter of judgment, count the votes necessary to\r\nelect him.\r\n\r\nIn my judgment we can elect nobody but General Taylor; and we cannot elect\r\nhim without a nomination. Therefore don't fail to send a delegate.\r\n\r\nYour friend as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,\r\n\r\nMAY 11, 1848.\r\n\r\nA bill for the admission of Wisconsin into the Union had been passed.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln moved to reconsider the vote by which the bill was passed.\r\nHe stated to the House that he had made this motion for the purpose of\r\nobtaining an opportunity to say a few words in relation to a point raised\r\nin the course of the debate on this bill, which he would now proceed to\r\nmake if in order. The point in the case to which he referred arose on the\r\namendment that was submitted by the gentleman from Vermont [Mr. Collamer]\r\nin Committee of the Whole on the State of the Union, and which was\r\nafterward renewed in the House, in relation to the question whether the\r\nreserved sections, which, by some bills heretofore passed, by which an\r\nappropriation of land had been made to Wisconsin, had been enhanced in\r\nvalue, should be reduced to the minimum price of the public lands. The\r\nquestion of the reduction in value of those sections was to him at this\r\ntime a matter very nearly of indifference. He was inclined to desire that\r\nWisconsin should be obliged by having it reduced. But the gentleman from\r\nIndiana [Mr. C. B. Smith], the chairman of the Committee on Territories,\r\nyesterday associated that question with the general question, which is now\r\nto some extent agitated in Congress, of making appropriations of alternate\r\nsections of land to aid the States in making internal improvements, and\r\nenhancing the price of the sections reserved, and the gentleman from\r\nIndiana took ground against that policy. He did not make any special\r\nargument in favor of Wisconsin, but he took ground generally against the\r\npolicy of giving alternate sections of land, and enhancing the price of\r\nthe reserved sections. Now he [Mr. Lincoln] did not at this time take the\r\nfloor for the purpose of attempting to make an argument on the general\r\nsubject. He rose simply to protest against the doctrine which the\r\ngentleman from Indiana had avowed in the course of what he [Mr. Lincoln]\r\ncould not but consider an unsound argument.\r\n\r\nIt might, however, be true, for anything he knew, that the gentleman\r\nfrom Indiana might convince him that his argument was sound; but he [Mr.\r\nLincoln] feared that gentleman would not be able to convince a majority\r\nin Congress that it was sound. It was true the question appeared in a\r\ndifferent aspect to persons in consequence of a difference in the point\r\nfrom which they looked at it. It did not look to persons residing east of\r\nthe mountains as it did to those who lived among the public lands. But,\r\nfor his part, he would state that if Congress would make a donation of\r\nalternate sections of public land for the purpose of internal improvements\r\nin his State, and forbid the reserved sections being sold at $1.25, he\r\nshould be glad to see the appropriation made; though he should prefer\r\nit if the reserved sections were not enhanced in price. He repeated, he\r\nshould be glad to have such appropriations made, even though the reserved\r\nsections should be enhanced in price. He did not wish to be understood\r\nas concurring in any intimation that they would refuse to receive such an\r\nappropriation of alternate sections of land because a condition enhancing\r\nthe price of the reserved sections should be attached thereto. He believed\r\nhis position would now be understood: if not, he feared he should not be\r\nable to make himself understood.\r\n\r\nBut, before he took his seat, he would remark that the Senate during the\r\npresent session had passed a bill making appropriations of land on that\r\nprinciple for the benefit of the State in which he resided the State\r\nof Illinois. The alternate sections were to be given for the purpose of\r\nconstructing roads, and the reserved sections were to be enhanced in value\r\nin consequence. When that bill came here for the action of this House--it\r\nhad been received, and was now before the Committee on Public Lands--he\r\ndesired much to see it passed as it was, if it could be put in no more\r\nfavorable form for the State of Illinois. When it should be before this\r\nHouse, if any member from a section of the Union in which these lands\r\ndid not lie, whose interest might be less than that which he felt, should\r\npropose a reduction of the price of the reserved sections to $1.25, he\r\nshould be much obliged; but he did not think it would be well for those\r\nwho came from the section of the Union in which the lands lay to do\r\nso.--He wished it, then, to be understood that he did not join in the\r\nwarfare against the principle which had engaged the minds of some members\r\nof Congress who were favorable to the improvements in the western country.\r\nThere was a good deal of force, he admitted, in what fell from the\r\nchairman of the Committee on Territories. It might be that there was no\r\nprecise justice in raising the price of the reserved sections to $2.50 per\r\nacre. It might be proper that the price should be enhanced to some extent,\r\nthough not to double the usual price; but he should be glad to have such\r\nan appropriation with the reserved sections at $2.50; he should be better\r\npleased to have the price of those sections at something less; and he\r\nshould be still better pleased to have them without any enhancement at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThere was one portion of the argument of the gentleman from Indiana, the\r\nchairman of the Committee on Territories [Mr. Smith], which he wished to\r\ntake occasion to say that he did not view as unsound. He alluded to the\r\nstatement that the General Government was interested in these internal\r\nimprovements being made, inasmuch as they increased the value of the lands\r\nthat were unsold, and they enabled the government to sell the lands which\r\ncould not be sold without them. Thus, then, the government gained by\r\ninternal improvements as well as by the general good which the people\r\nderived from them, and it might be, therefore, that the lands should\r\nnot be sold for more than $1.50 instead of the price being doubled. He,\r\nhowever, merely mentioned this in passing, for he only rose to state,\r\nas the principle of giving these lands for the purposes which he had\r\nmentioned had been laid hold of and considered favorably, and as there\r\nwere some gentlemen who had constitutional scruples about giving money\r\nfor these purchases who would not hesitate to give land, that he was\r\nnot willing to have it understood that he was one of those who made\r\nwar against that principle. This was all he desired to say, and having\r\naccomplished the object with which he rose, he withdrew his motion to\r\nreconsider.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON TAYLOR'S NOMINATION\r\n\r\nTO E. B. WASHBURNE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, April 30,1848.\r\n\r\nDEAR WASHBURNE:\r\n\r\nI have this moment received your very short note asking me if old Taylor\r\nis to be used up, and who will be the nominee. My hope of Taylor's\r\nnomination is as high--a little higher than it was when you left. Still,\r\nthe case is by no means out of doubt. Mr. Clay's letter has not advanced\r\nhis interests any here. Several who were against Taylor, but not for\r\nanybody particularly, before, are since taking ground, some for Scott\r\nand some for McLean. Who will be nominated neither I nor any one else can\r\ntell. Now, let me pray to you in turn. My prayer is that you let nothing\r\ndiscourage or baffle you, but that, in spite of every difficulty, you send\r\nus a good Taylor delegate from your circuit. Make Baker, who is now with\r\nyou, I suppose, help about it. He is a good hand to raise a breeze.\r\n\r\nGeneral Ashley, in the Senate from Arkansas, died yesterday. Nothing else\r\nnew beyond what you see in the papers.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFENSE OF MEXICAN WAR POSITION\r\n\r\nTO REV. J. M. PECK\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, May 21, 1848. DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\n....Not in view of all the facts. There are facts which you have kept out\r\nof view. It is a fact that the United States army in marching to the Rio\r\nGrande marched into a peaceful Mexican settlement, and frightened the\r\ninhabitants away from their homes and their growing crops. It is a fact\r\nthat Fort Brown, opposite Matamoras, was built by that army within a\r\nMexican cotton-field, on which at the time the army reached it a young\r\ncotton crop was growing, and which crop was wholly destroyed and the field\r\nitself greatly and permanently injured by ditches, embankments, and the\r\nlike. It is a fact that when the Mexicans captured Captain Thornton and\r\nhis command, they found and captured them within another Mexican field.\r\n\r\nNow I wish to bring these facts to your notice, and to ascertain what is\r\nthe result of your reflections upon them. If you deny that they are\r\nfacts, I think I can furnish proofs which shall convince you that you are\r\nmistaken. If you admit that they are facts, then I shall be obliged for\r\na reference to any law of language, law of States, law of nations, law of\r\nmorals, law of religions, any law, human or divine, in which an authority\r\ncan be found for saying those facts constitute \"no aggression.\"\r\n\r\nPossibly you consider those acts too small for notice. Would you venture\r\nto so consider them had they been committed by any nation on earth against\r\nthe humblest of our people? I know you would not. Then I ask, is the\r\nprecept \"Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to\r\nthem\" obsolete? of no force? of no application?\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON ZACHARY TAYLOR NOMINATION\r\n\r\nTO ARCHIBALD WILLIAMS.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 12, 1848.\r\n\r\nDEAR WILLIAMS:--On my return from Philadelphia, where I had been attending\r\nthe nomination of \"Old Rough,\" (Zachary Taylor) I found your letter in a\r\nmass of others which had accumulated in my absence. By many, and often, it\r\nhad been said they would not abide the nomination of Taylor; but since the\r\ndeed has been done, they are fast falling in, and in my opinion we shall\r\nhave a most overwhelming, glorious triumph. One unmistakable sign is that\r\nall the odds and ends are with us--Barnburners, Native Americans, Tyler\r\nmen, disappointed office-seeking Locofocos, and the Lord knows what. This\r\nis important, if in nothing else, in showing which way the wind blows.\r\nSome of the sanguine men have set down all the States as certain for\r\nTaylor but Illinois, and it as doubtful. Cannot something be done even in\r\nIllinois? Taylor's nomination takes the Locos on the blind side. It turns\r\nthe war thunder against them. The war is now to them the gallows of\r\nHaman, which they built for us, and on which they are doomed to be hanged\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nExcuse this short letter. I have so many to write that I cannot devote\r\nmuch time to any one.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,\r\n\r\nJUNE 20, 1848.\r\n\r\nIn Committee of the Whole on the State of the Union, on the Civil and\r\nDiplomatic Appropriation Bill:\r\n\r\nMr. CHAIRMAN:--I wish at all times in no way to practise any fraud upon\r\nthe House or the committee, and I also desire to do nothing which may be\r\nvery disagreeable to any of the members. I therefore state in advance that\r\nmy object in taking the floor is to make a speech on the general subject\r\nof internal improvements; and if I am out of order in doing so, I give the\r\nchair an opportunity of so deciding, and I will take my seat.\r\n\r\nThe Chair: I will not undertake to anticipate what the gentleman may say\r\non the subject of internal improvements. He will, therefore, proceed in\r\nhis remarks, and if any question of order shall be made, the chair will\r\nthen decide it.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln: At an early day of this session the President sent us what\r\nmay properly be called an internal improvement veto message. The late\r\nDemocratic convention, which sat at Baltimore, and which nominated General\r\nCass for the Presidency, adopted a set of resolutions, now called the\r\nDemocratic platform, among which is one in these words:\r\n\r\n\"That the Constitution does not confer upon the General Government the\r\npower to commence and carry on a general system of internal improvements.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Cass, in his letter accepting the nomination, holds this language:\r\n\r\n\"I have carefully read the resolutions of the Democratic national\r\nconvention, laying down the platform of our political faith, and I adhere\r\nto them as firmly as I approve them cordially.\"\r\n\r\nThese things, taken together, show that the question of internal\r\nimprovements is now more distinctly made--has become more intense--than\r\nat any former period. The veto message and the Baltimore resolution I\r\nunderstand to be, in substance, the same thing; the latter being the more\r\ngeneral statement, of which the former is the amplification the bill of\r\nparticulars. While I know there are many Democrats, on this floor and\r\nelsewhere, who disapprove that message, I understand that all who voted\r\nfor General Cass will thereafter be counted as having approved it, as\r\nhaving indorsed all its doctrines.\r\n\r\nI suppose all, or nearly all, the Democrats will vote for him. Many of\r\nthem will do so not because they like his position on this question,\r\nbut because they prefer him, being wrong on this, to another whom they\r\nconsider farther wrong on other questions. In this way the internal\r\nimprovement Democrats are to be, by a sort of forced consent, carried over\r\nand arrayed against themselves on this measure of policy. General Cass,\r\nonce elected, will not trouble himself to make a constitutional argument,\r\nor perhaps any argument at all, when he shall veto a river or harbor bill;\r\nhe will consider it a sufficient answer to all Democratic murmurs to point\r\nto Mr. Polk's message, and to the Democratic platform. This being the\r\ncase, the question of improvements is verging to a final crisis; and the\r\nfriends of this policy must now battle, and battle manfully, or surrender\r\nall. In this view, humble as I am, I wish to review, and contest as well\r\nas I may, the general positions of this veto message. When I say general\r\npositions, I mean to exclude from consideration so much as relates to the\r\npresent embarrassed state of the treasury in consequence of the Mexican\r\nWar.\r\n\r\nThose general positions are: that internal improvements ought not to be\r\nmade by the General Government--First. Because they would overwhelm the\r\ntreasury Second. Because, while their burdens would be general, their\r\nbenefits would be local and partial, involving an obnoxious inequality;\r\nand Third. Because they would be unconstitutional. Fourth. Because the\r\nStates may do enough by the levy and collection of tonnage duties; or if\r\nnot--Fifth. That the Constitution may be amended. \"Do nothing at all, lest\r\nyou do something wrong,\" is the sum of these positions is the sum of\r\nthis message. And this, with the exception of what is said about\r\nconstitutionality, applying as forcibly to what is said about making\r\nimprovements by State authority as by the national authority; so that we\r\nmust abandon the improvements of the country altogether, by any and every\r\nauthority, or we must resist and repudiate the doctrines of this message.\r\nLet us attempt the latter.\r\n\r\nThe first position is, that a system of internal improvements would\r\noverwhelm the treasury. That in such a system there is a tendency to undue\r\nexpansion, is not to be denied. Such tendency is founded in the nature\r\nof the subject. A member of Congress will prefer voting for a bill which\r\ncontains an appropriation for his district, to voting for one which\r\ndoes not; and when a bill shall be expanded till every district shall be\r\nprovided for, that it will be too greatly expanded is obvious. But is\r\nthis any more true in Congress than in a State Legislature? If a member\r\nof Congress must have an appropriation for his district, so a member of\r\na Legislature must have one for his county. And if one will overwhelm\r\nthe national treasury, so the other will overwhelm the State treasury. Go\r\nwhere we will, the difficulty is the same. Allow it to drive us from the\r\nhalls of Congress, and it will, just as easily, drive us from the State\r\nLegislatures. Let us, then, grapple with it, and test its strength. Let\r\nus, judging of the future by the past, ascertain whether there may not be,\r\nin the discretion of Congress, a sufficient power to limit and restrain\r\nthis expansive tendency within reasonable and proper bounds. The President\r\nhimself values the evidence of the past. He tells us that at a certain\r\npoint of our history more than two hundred millions of dollars had been\r\napplied for to make improvements; and this he does to prove that the\r\ntreasury would be overwhelmed by such a system. Why did he not tell us how\r\nmuch was granted? Would not that have been better evidence? Let us turn\r\nto it, and see what it proves. In the message the President tells us\r\nthat \"during the four succeeding years embraced by the administration of\r\nPresident Adams, the power not only to appropriate money, but to apply it,\r\nunder the direction and authority of the General Government, as well to\r\nthe construction of roads as to the improvement of harbors and rivers,\r\nwas fully asserted and exercised.\" This, then, was the period of greatest\r\nenormity. These, if any, must have been the days of the two hundred\r\nmillions. And how much do you suppose was really expended for improvements\r\nduring that four years? Two hundred millions? One hundred? Fifty? Ten?\r\nFive? No, sir; less than two millions. As shown by authentic documents,\r\nthe expenditures on improvements during 1825, 1826, 1827, and 1828\r\namounted to one million eight hundred and seventy-nine thousand six\r\nhundred and twenty-seven dollars and one cent. These four years were the\r\nperiod of Mr. Adams's administration, nearly and substantially. This fact\r\nshows that when the power to make improvements \"was fully asserted and\r\nexercised,\" the Congress did keep within reasonable limits; and what has\r\nbeen done, it seems to me, can be done again.\r\n\r\nNow for the second portion of the message--namely, that the burdens of\r\nimprovements would be general, while their benefits would be local and\r\npartial, involving an obnoxious inequality. That there is some degree\r\nof truth in this position, I shall not deny. No commercial object of\r\ngovernment patronage can be so exclusively general as to not be of some\r\npeculiar local advantage. The navy, as I understand it, was established,\r\nand is maintained at a great annual expense, partly to be ready for\r\nwar when war shall come, and partly also, and perhaps chiefly, for the\r\nprotection of our commerce on the high seas. This latter object is, for\r\nall I can see, in principle the same as internal improvements. The driving\r\na pirate from the track of commerce on the broad ocean, and the removing\r\nof a snag from its more narrow path in the Mississippi River, cannot,\r\nI think, be distinguished in principle. Each is done to save life and\r\nproperty, and for nothing else.\r\n\r\nThe navy, then, is the most general in its benefits of all this class\r\nof objects; and yet even the navy is of some peculiar advantage to\r\nCharleston, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston, beyond what it\r\nis to the interior towns of Illinois. The next most general object I\r\ncan think of would be improvements on the Mississippi River and its\r\ntributaries. They touch thirteen of our States-Pennsylvania, Virginia,\r\nKentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois,\r\nIndiana, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Iowa. Now I suppose it will not be denied\r\nthat these thirteen States are a little more interested in improvements on\r\nthat great river than are the remaining seventeen. These instances of the\r\nnavy and the Mississippi River show clearly that there is something of\r\nlocal advantage in the most general objects. But the converse is also\r\ntrue. Nothing is so local as to not be of some general benefit. Take,\r\nfor instance, the Illinois and Michigan Canal. Considered apart from its\r\neffects, it is perfectly local. Every inch of it is within the State of\r\nIllinois. That canal was first opened for business last April. In a very\r\nfew days we were all gratified to learn, among other things, that sugar\r\nhad been carried from New Orleans through this canal to Buffalo in New\r\nYork. This sugar took this route, doubtless, because it was cheaper than\r\nthe old route. Supposing benefit of the reduction in the cost of carriage\r\nto be shared between seller and the buyer, result is that the New Orleans\r\nmerchant sold his sugar a little dearer, and the people of Buffalo\r\nsweetened their coffee a little cheaper, than before,--a benefit resulting\r\nfrom the canal, not to Illinois, where the canal is, but to Louisiana and\r\nNew York, where it is not. In other transactions Illinois will, of course,\r\nhave her share, and perhaps the larger share too, of the benefits of the\r\ncanal; but this instance of the sugar clearly shows that the benefits of\r\nan improvement are by no means confined to the particular locality of\r\nthe improvement itself. The just conclusion from all this is that if the\r\nnation refuse to make improvements of the more general kind because their\r\nbenefits may be somewhat local, a State may for the same reason refuse to\r\nmake an improvement of a local kind because its benefits may be somewhat\r\ngeneral. A State may well say to the nation, \"If you will do nothing for\r\nme, I will do nothing for you.\" Thus it is seen that if this argument of\r\n\"inequality\" is sufficient anywhere, it is sufficient everywhere, and puts\r\nan end to improvements altogether. I hope and believe that if both the\r\nnation and the States would, in good faith, in their respective spheres\r\ndo what they could in the way of improvements, what of inequality might be\r\nproduced in one place might be compensated in another, and the sum of the\r\nwhole might not be very unequal.\r\n\r\nBut suppose, after all, there should be some degree of inequality.\r\nInequality is certainly never to be embraced for its own sake; but is\r\nevery good thing to be discarded which may be inseparably connected with\r\nsome degree of it? If so, we must discard all government. This Capitol\r\nis built at the public expense, for the public benefit; but does any one\r\ndoubt that it is of some peculiar local advantage to the property-holders\r\nand business people of Washington? Shall we remove it for this reason?\r\nAnd if so, where shall we set it down, and be free from the difficulty?\r\nTo make sure of our object, shall we locate it nowhere, and have Congress\r\nhereafter to hold its sessions, as the loafer lodged, \"in spots about\"?\r\nI make no allusion to the present President when I say there are few\r\nstronger cases in this world of \"burden to the many and benefit to the\r\nfew,\" of \"inequality,\" than the Presidency itself is by some thought to\r\nbe. An honest laborer digs coal at about seventy cents a day, while the\r\nPresident digs abstractions at about seventy dollars a day. The coal\r\nis clearly worth more than the abstractions, and yet what a monstrous\r\ninequality in the prices! Does the President, for this reason, propose to\r\nabolish the Presidency? He does not, and he ought not. The true rule, in\r\ndetermining to embrace or reject anything, is not whether it have any evil\r\nin it, but whether it have more of evil than of good. There are few things\r\nwholly evil or wholly good. Almost everything, especially of government\r\npolicy, is an inseparable compound of the two; so that our best judgment\r\nof the preponderance between them is continually demanded. On this\r\nprinciple the President, his friends, and the world generally act on\r\nmost subjects. Why not apply it, then, upon this question? Why, as to\r\nimprovements, magnify the evil, and stoutly refuse to see any good in\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman, on the third position of the message the constitutional\r\nquestion--I have not much to say. Being the man I am, and speaking, where\r\nI do, I feel that in any attempt at an original constitutional argument\r\nI should not be and ought not to be listened to patiently. The ablest and\r\nthe best of men have gone over the whole ground long ago. I shall attempt\r\nbut little more than a brief notice of what some of them have said. In\r\nrelation to Mr. Jefferson's views, I read from Mr. Polk's veto message:\r\n\r\n\"President Jefferson, in his message to Congress in 1806, recommended an\r\namendment of the Constitution, with a view to apply an anticipated surplus\r\nin the treasury 'to the great purposes of the public education, roads,\r\nrivers, canals, and such other objects of public improvement as it may\r\nbe thought proper to add to the constitutional enumeration of the federal\r\npowers'; and he adds: 'I suppose an amendment to the Constitution, by\r\nconsent of the States, necessary, because the objects now recommended are\r\nnot among those enumerated in the Constitution, and to which it permits\r\nthe public moneys to be applied.' In 1825, he repeated in his published\r\nletters the opinion that no such power has been conferred upon Congress.\"\r\n\r\nI introduce this not to controvert just now the constitutional opinion,\r\nbut to show that, on the question of expediency, Mr. Jefferson's opinion\r\nwas against the present President; that this opinion of Mr. Jefferson,\r\nin one branch at least, is in the hands of Mr. Polk like McFingal's\r\ngun--\"bears wide and kicks the owner over.\"\r\n\r\nBut to the constitutional question. In 1826 Chancellor Kent first\r\npublished his Commentaries on American law. He devoted a portion of one of\r\nthe lectures to the question of the authority of Congress to appropriate\r\npublic moneys for internal improvements. He mentions that the subject had\r\nnever been brought under judicial consideration, and proceeds to give a\r\nbrief summary of the discussion it had undergone between the legislative\r\nand executive branches of the government. He shows that the legislative\r\nbranch had usually been for, and the executive against, the power, till\r\nthe period of Mr. J.Q. Adams's administration, at which point he considers\r\nthe executive influence as withdrawn from opposition, and added to the\r\nsupport of the power. In 1844 the chancellor published a new edition of\r\nhis Commentaries, in which he adds some notes of what had transpired on\r\nthe question since 1826. I have not time to read the original text on\r\nthe notes; but the whole may be found on page 267, and the two or three\r\nfollowing pages, of the first volume of the edition of 1844. As to what\r\nChancellor Kent seems to consider the sum of the whole, I read from one of\r\nthe notes:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Justice Story, in his Commentaries on the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, Vol. II., pp. 429-440, and again pp. 519-538, has stated at\r\nlarge the arguments for and against the proposition that Congress have a\r\nconstitutional authority to lay taxes and to apply the power to\r\nregulate commerce as a means directly to encourage and protect domestic\r\nmanufactures; and without giving any opinion of his own on the contested\r\ndoctrine, he has left the reader to draw his own conclusions. I should\r\nthink, however, from the arguments as stated, that every mind which has\r\ntaken no part in the discussion, and felt no prejudice or territorial bias\r\non either side of the question, would deem the arguments in favor of the\r\nCongressional power vastly superior.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that in this extract the power to make improvements is not\r\ndirectly mentioned; but by examining the context, both of Kent and Story,\r\nit will be seen that the power mentioned in the extract and the power to\r\nmake improvements are regarded as identical. It is not to be denied that\r\nmany great and good men have been against the power; but it is insisted\r\nthat quite as many, as great and as good, have been for it; and it is\r\nshown that, on a full survey of the whole, Chancellor Kent was of opinion\r\nthat the arguments of the latter were vastly superior. This is but the\r\nopinion of a man; but who was that man? He was one of the ablest and most\r\nlearned lawyers of his age, or of any age. It is no disparagement to\r\nMr. Polk, nor indeed to any one who devotes much time to politics, to\r\nbe placed far behind Chancellor Kent as a lawyer. His attitude was most\r\nfavorable to correct conclusions. He wrote coolly, and in retirement. He\r\nwas struggling to rear a durable monument of fame; and he well knew that\r\ntruth and thoroughly sound reasoning were the only sure foundations. Can\r\nthe party opinion of a party President on a law question, as this purely\r\nis, be at all compared or set in opposition to that of such a man, in\r\nsuch an attitude, as Chancellor Kent? This constitutional question will\r\nprobably never be better settled than it is, until it shall pass under\r\njudicial consideration; but I do think no man who is clear on the\r\nquestions of expediency need feel his conscience much pricked upon this.\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman, the President seems to think that enough may be done, in\r\nthe way of improvements, by means of tonnage duties under State authority,\r\nwith the consent of the General Government. Now I suppose this matter\r\nof tonnage duties is well enough in its own sphere. I suppose it may be\r\nefficient, and perhaps sufficient, to make slight improvements and repairs\r\nin harbors already in use and not much out of repair. But if I have any\r\ncorrect general idea of it, it must be wholly inefficient for any general\r\nbeneficent purposes of improvement. I know very little, or rather nothing\r\nat all, of the practical matter of levying and collecting tonnage\r\nduties; but I suppose one of its principles must be to lay a duty for the\r\nimprovement of any particular harbor upon the tonnage coming into that\r\nharbor; to do otherwise--to collect money in one harbor, to be expended\r\non improvements in another--would be an extremely aggravated form of that\r\ninequality which the President so much deprecates. If I be right in this,\r\nhow could we make any entirely new improvement by means of tonnage duties?\r\nHow make a road, a canal, or clear a greatly obstructed river? The idea\r\nthat we could involves the same absurdity as the Irish bull about the new\r\nboots. \"I shall niver git 'em on,\" says Patrick, \"till I wear 'em a day\r\nor two, and stretch 'em a little.\" We shall never make a canal by tonnage\r\nduties until it shall already have been made awhile, so the tonnage can\r\nget into it.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the President concludes that possibly there may be some great\r\nobjects of improvement which cannot be effected by tonnage duties, and\r\nwhich it therefore may be expedient for the General Government to take\r\nin hand. Accordingly he suggests, in case any such be discovered, the\r\npropriety of amending the Constitution. Amend it for what? If, like\r\nMr. Jefferson, the President thought improvements expedient, but not\r\nconstitutional, it would be natural enough for him to recommend such an\r\namendment. But hear what he says in this very message:\r\n\r\n\"In view of these portentous consequences, I cannot but think that this\r\ncourse of legislation should be arrested, even were there nothing to\r\nforbid it in the fundamental laws of our Union.\"\r\n\r\nFor what, then, would he have the Constitution amended? With him it is a\r\nproposition to remove one impediment merely to be met by others which,\r\nin his opinion, cannot be removed, to enable Congress to do what, in his\r\nopinion, they ought not to do if they could.\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Meade of Virginia inquired if Mr. Lincoln understood the\r\nPresident to be opposed, on grounds of expediency, to any and every\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln answered: In the very part of his message of which I am\r\nspeaking, I understand him as giving some vague expression in favor of\r\nsome possible objects of improvement; but in doing so I understand him\r\nto be directly on the teeth of his own arguments in other parts of it.\r\nNeither the President nor any one can possibly specify an improvement\r\nwhich shall not be clearly liable to one or another of the objections he\r\nhas urged on the score of expediency. I have shown, and might show again,\r\nthat no work--no object--can be so general as to dispense its benefits\r\nwith precise equality; and this inequality is chief among the \"portentous\r\nconsequences\" for which he declares that improvements should be arrested.\r\nNo, sir. When the President intimates that something in the way of\r\nimprovements may properly be done by the General Government, he is\r\nshrinking from the conclusions to which his own arguments would force him.\r\nHe feels that the improvements of this broad and goodly land are a mighty\r\ninterest; and he is unwilling to confess to the people, or perhaps\r\nto himself, that he has built an argument which, when pressed to its\r\nconclusions, entirely annihilates this interest.\r\n\r\nI have already said that no one who is satisfied of the expediency of\r\nmaking improvements needs be much uneasy in his conscience about its\r\nconstitutionality. I wish now to submit a few remarks on the general\r\nproposition of amending the Constitution. As a general rule, I think we\r\nwould much better let it alone. No slight occasion should tempt us to\r\ntouch it. Better not take the first step, which may lead to a habit\r\nof altering it. Better, rather, habituate ourselves to think of it as\r\nunalterable. It can scarcely be made better than it is. New provisions\r\nwould introduce new difficulties, and thus create and increase appetite\r\nfor further change. No, sir; let it stand as it is. New hands have never\r\ntouched it. The men who made it have done their work, and have passed\r\naway. Who shall improve on what they did?\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman, for the purpose of reviewing this message in the least\r\npossible time, as well as for the sake of distinctness, I have analyzed\r\nits arguments as well as I could, and reduced them to the propositions\r\nI have stated. I have now examined them in detail. I wish to detain the\r\ncommittee only a little while longer with some general remarks upon the\r\nsubject of improvements. That the subject is a difficult one, cannot\r\nbe denied. Still it is no more difficult in Congress than in the State\r\nLegislatures, in the counties, or in the smallest municipal districts\r\nwhich anywhere exist. All can recur to instances of this difficulty in the\r\ncase of county roads, bridges, and the like. One man is offended because\r\na road passes over his land, and another is offended because it does not\r\npass over his; one is dissatisfied because the bridge for which he is\r\ntaxed crosses the river on a different road from that which leads from his\r\nhouse to town; another cannot bear that the county should be got in debt\r\nfor these same roads and bridges; while not a few struggle hard to have\r\nroads located over their lands, and then stoutly refuse to let them be\r\nopened until they are first paid the damages. Even between the different\r\nwards and streets of towns and cities we find this same wrangling and\r\ndifficulty. Now these are no other than the very difficulties against\r\nwhich, and out of which, the President constructs his objections of\r\n\"inequality,\" \"speculation,\" and \"crushing the treasury.\" There is but a\r\nsingle alternative about them: they are sufficient, or they are not. If\r\nsufficient, they are sufficient out of Congress as well as in it, and\r\nthere is the end. We must reject them as insufficient, or lie down and do\r\nnothing by any authority. Then, difficulty though there be, let us meet\r\nand encounter it. \"Attempt the end, and never stand to doubt; nothing so\r\nhard, but search will find it out.\" Determine that the thing can and shall\r\nbe done, and then we shall find the way. The tendency to undue expansion\r\nis unquestionably the chief difficulty.\r\n\r\nHow to do something, and still not do too much, is the desideratum. Let\r\neach contribute his mite in the way of suggestion. The late Silas Wright,\r\nin a letter to the Chicago convention, contributed his, which was worth\r\nsomething; and I now contribute mine, which may be worth nothing. At all\r\nevents, it will mislead nobody, and therefore will do no harm. I would not\r\nborrow money. I am against an overwhelming, crushing system. Suppose that,\r\nat each session, Congress shall first determine how much money can, for\r\nthat year, be spared for improvements; then apportion that sum to the most\r\nimportant objects. So far all is easy; but how shall we determine which\r\nare the most important? On this question comes the collision of interests.\r\nI shall be slow to acknowledge that your harbor or your river is more\r\nimportant than mine, and vice versa. To clear this difficulty, let us\r\nhave that same statistical information which the gentleman from Ohio [Mr.\r\nVinton] suggested at the beginning of this session. In that information we\r\nshall have a stern, unbending basis of facts--a basis in no wise subject\r\nto whim, caprice, or local interest. The prelimited amount of means will\r\nsave us from doing too much, and the statistics will save us from doing\r\nwhat we do in wrong places. Adopt and adhere to this course, and, it seems\r\nto me, the difficulty is cleared.\r\n\r\nOne of the gentlemen from South Carolina [Mr. Rhett] very much deprecates\r\nthese statistics. He particularly objects, as I understand him, to\r\ncounting all the pigs and chickens in the land. I do not perceive much\r\nforce in the objection. It is true that if everything be enumerated, a\r\nportion of such statistics may not be very useful to this object. Such\r\nproducts of the country as are to be consumed where they are produced need\r\nno roads or rivers, no means of transportation, and have no very proper\r\nconnection with this subject. The surplus--that which is produced in\r\none place to be consumed in another; the capacity of each locality for\r\nproducing a greater surplus; the natural means of transportation, and\r\ntheir susceptibility of improvement; the hindrances, delays, and losses of\r\nlife and property during transportation, and the causes of each, would be\r\namong the most valuable statistics in this connection. From these it would\r\nreadily appear where a given amount of expenditure would do the most good.\r\nThese statistics might be equally accessible, as they would be equally\r\nuseful, to both the nation and the States. In this way, and by these\r\nmeans, let the nation take hold of the larger works, and the States the\r\nsmaller ones; and thus, working in a meeting direction, discreetly, but\r\nsteadily and firmly, what is made unequal in one place may be equalized in\r\nanother, extravagance avoided, and the whole country put on that career\r\nof prosperity which shall correspond with its extent of territory, its\r\nnatural resources, and the intelligence and enterprise of its people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG POLITICIANS\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM H. HERNDON.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, June 22, 1848.\r\n\r\nDEAR WILLIAM:--Last night I was attending a sort of caucus of the Whig\r\nmembers, held in relation to the coming Presidential election. The whole\r\nfield of the nation was scanned, and all is high hope and confidence.\r\nIllinois is expected to better her condition in this race. Under these\r\ncircumstances, judge how heartrending it was to come to my room and find\r\nand read your discouraging letter of the 15th. We have made no gains, but\r\nhave lost \"H. R. Robinson, Turner, Campbell, and four or five more.\"\r\nTell Arney to reconsider, if he would be saved. Baker and I used to do\r\nsomething, but I think you attach more importance to our absence than is\r\njust. There is another cause. In 1840, for instance, we had two senators\r\nand five representatives in Sangamon; now we have part of one senator and\r\ntwo representatives. With quite one third more people than we had then, we\r\nhave only half the sort of offices which are sought by men of the speaking\r\nsort of talent. This, I think, is the chief cause. Now, as to the young\r\nmen. You must not wait to be brought forward by the older men. For\r\ninstance, do you suppose that I should ever have got into notice if I had\r\nwaited to be hunted up and pushed forward by older men? You young men get\r\ntogether and form a \"Rough and Ready Club,\" and have regular meetings and\r\nspeeches. Take in everybody you can get. Harrison Grimsley, L. A. Enos,\r\nLee Kimball, and C. W. Matheny will do to begin the thing; but as you go\r\nalong gather up all the shrewd, wild boys about town, whether just of age,\r\nor a little under age, Chris. Logan, Reddick Ridgely, Lewis Zwizler, and\r\nhundreds such. Let every one play the part he can play best,--some speak,\r\nsome sing, and all \"holler.\" Your meetings will be of evenings; the\r\nolder men, and the women, will go to hear you; so that it will not only\r\ncontribute to the election of \"Old Zach,\" but will be an interesting\r\npastime, and improving to the intellectual faculties of all engaged. Don't\r\nfail to do this.\r\n\r\nYou ask me to send you all the speeches made about \"Old Zach,\" the war,\r\netc. Now this makes me a little impatient. I have regularly sent you the\r\nCongressional Globe and Appendix, and you cannot have examined them, or\r\nyou would have discovered that they contain every speech made by every man\r\nin both houses of Congress, on every subject, during the session. Can I\r\nsend any more? Can I send speeches that nobody has made? Thinking it would\r\nbe most natural that the newspapers would feel interested to give at least\r\nsome of the speeches to their readers, I at the beginning of the session\r\nmade arrangements to have one copy of the Globe and Appendix regularly\r\nsent to each Whig paper of the district. And yet, with the exception of my\r\nown little speech, which was published in two only of the then five, now\r\nfour, Whig papers, I do not remember having seen a single speech, or even\r\nextract from one, in any single one of those papers. With equal and full\r\nmeans on both sides, I will venture that the State Register has thrown\r\nbefore its readers more of Locofoco speeches in a month than all the Whig\r\npapers of the district have done of Whig speeches during the session.\r\n\r\nIf you wish a full understanding of the war, I repeat what I believe I\r\nsaid to you in a letter once before, that the whole, or nearly so, is\r\nto be found in the speech of Dixon of Connecticut. This I sent you in\r\npamphlet as well as in the Globe. Examine and study every sentence of that\r\nspeech thoroughly, and you will understand the whole subject. You ask how\r\nCongress came to declare that war had existed by the act of Mexico. Is it\r\npossible you don't understand that yet? You have at least twenty speeches\r\nin your possession that fully explain it. I will, however, try it once\r\nmore. The news reached Washington of the commencement of hostilities\r\non the Rio Grande, and of the great peril of General Taylor's army.\r\nEverybody, Whigs and Democrats, was for sending them aid, in men and\r\nmoney. It was necessary to pass a bill for this. The Locos had a majority\r\nin both houses, and they brought in a bill with a preamble saying:\r\nWhereas, War exists by the act of Mexico, therefore we send General Taylor\r\nmoney. The Whigs moved to strike out the preamble, so that they could\r\nvote to send the men and money, without saying anything about how the\r\nwar commenced; but being in the minority, they were voted down, and the\r\npreamble was retained. Then, on the passage of the bill, the question came\r\nupon them, Shall we vote for preamble and bill together, or against\r\nboth together? They did not want to vote against sending help to\r\nGeneral Taylor, and therefore they voted for both together. Is there any\r\ndifficulty in understanding this? Even my little speech shows how this\r\nwas; and if you will go to the library, you may get the Journal of\r\n1845-46, in which you will find the whole for yourself.\r\n\r\nWe have nothing published yet with special reference to the Taylor race;\r\nbut we soon will have, and then I will send them to everybody. I made an\r\ninternal-improvement speech day before yesterday, which I shall send home\r\nas soon as I can get it written out and printed,--and which I suppose\r\nnobody will read.\r\n\r\nYour friend as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSALARY OF JUDGE IN WESTERN VIRGINIA\r\n\r\nREMARKS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, JUNE 28, 1848.\r\n\r\nDiscussion as to salary of judge of western Virginia:--Wishing to increase\r\nit from $1800 to $2500.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln said he felt unwilling to be either unjust or ungenerous,\r\nand he wanted to understand the real case of this judicial officer. The\r\ngentleman from Virginia had stated that he had to hold eleven courts. Now\r\neverybody knew that it was not the habit of the district judges of the\r\nUnited States in other States to hold anything like that number of\r\ncourts; and he therefore took it for granted that this must happen under a\r\npeculiar law which required that large number of courts to be holden every\r\nyear; and these laws, he further supposed, were passed at the request of\r\nthe people of that judicial district. It came, then, to this: that the\r\npeople in the western district of Virginia had got eleven courts to be\r\nheld among them in one year, for their own accommodation; and being thus\r\nbetter accommodated than neighbors elsewhere, they wanted their judge\r\nto be a little better paid. In Illinois there had been until the present\r\nseason but one district court held in the year. There were now to be two.\r\nCould it be that the western district of Virginia furnished more business\r\nfor a judge than the whole State of Illinois?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONAL BANK\r\n\r\nJULY, 1848,\r\n\r\n[FRAGMENT]\r\n\r\nThe question of a national bank is at rest. Were I President, I should not\r\nurge its reagitation upon Congress; but should Congress see fit to pass an\r\nact to establish such an institution, I should not arrest it by the veto,\r\nunless I should consider it subject to some constitutional objection from\r\nwhich I believe the two former banks to have been free.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYOUNG v.s. OLD--POLITICAL JEALOUSY\r\n\r\nTO W. H. HERNDON.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, July 10, 1848.\r\n\r\nDEAR WILLIAM:\r\n\r\nYour letter covering the newspaper slips was received last night. The\r\nsubject of that letter is exceedingly painful to me, and I cannot but\r\nthink there is some mistake in your impression of the motives of the old\r\nmen. I suppose I am now one of the old men; and I declare on my veracity,\r\nwhich I think is good with you, that nothing could afford me more\r\nsatisfaction than to learn that you and others of my young friends at home\r\nwere doing battle in the contest and endearing themselves to the people\r\nand taking a stand far above any I have ever been able to reach in their\r\nadmiration. I cannot conceive that other men feel differently. Of course\r\nI cannot demonstrate what I say; but I was young once, and I am sure I was\r\nnever ungenerously thrust back. I hardly know what to say. The way for a\r\nyoung man to rise is to improve himself every way he can, never suspecting\r\nthat anybody wishes to hinder him. Allow me to assure you that suspicion\r\nand jealousy never did help any man in any situation. There may sometimes\r\nbe ungenerous attempts to keep a young man down; and they will succeed,\r\ntoo, if he allows his mind to be diverted from its true channel to brood\r\nover the attempted injury. Cast about and see if this feeling has not\r\ninjured every person you have ever known to fall into it.\r\n\r\nNow, in what I have said I am sure you will suspect nothing but sincere\r\nfriendship. I would save you from a fatal error. You have been a studious\r\nyoung man. You are far better informed on almost all subjects than I ever\r\nhave been. You cannot fail in any laudable object unless you allow your\r\nmind to be improperly directed. I have some the advantage of you in the\r\nworld's experience, merely by being older; and it is this that induces me\r\nto advise. You still seem to be a little mistaken about the Congressional\r\nGlobe and Appendix. They contain all of the speeches that are published in\r\nany way. My speech and Dayton's speech which you say you got in pamphlet\r\nform are both word for word in the Appendix. I repeat again, all are\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nYour friend, as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL TAYLOR AND THE VETO\r\n\r\nSPEECH IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, JULY 27, 1848.\r\n\r\nMr. SPEAKER, our Democratic friends seem to be in a great distress because\r\nthey think our candidate for the Presidency don't suit us. Most of them\r\ncannot find out that General Taylor has any principles at all; some,\r\nhowever, have discovered that he has one, but that one is entirely wrong.\r\nThis one principle is his position on the veto power. The gentleman from\r\nTennessee [Mr. Stanton] who has just taken his seat, indeed, has said\r\nthere is very little, if any, difference on this question between General\r\nTaylor and all the Presidents; and he seems to think it sufficient\r\ndetraction from General Taylor's position on it that it has nothing new\r\nin it. But all others whom I have heard speak assail it furiously. A new\r\nmember from Kentucky [Mr. Clark], of very considerable ability, was\r\nin particular concerned about it. He thought it altogether novel and\r\nunprecedented for a President or a Presidential candidate to think of\r\napproving bills whose constitutionality may not be entirely clear to his\r\nown mind. He thinks the ark of our safety is gone unless Presidents\r\nshall always veto such bills as in their judgment may be of doubtful\r\nconstitutionality. However clear Congress may be on their authority to\r\npass any particular act, the gentleman from Kentucky thinks the President\r\nmust veto it if he has doubts about it. Now I have neither time nor\r\ninclination to argue with the gentleman on the veto power as an original\r\nquestion; but I wish to show that General Taylor, and not he, agrees with\r\nthe earlier statesmen on this question. When the bill chartering the\r\nfirst Bank of the United States passed Congress, its constitutionality was\r\nquestioned. Mr. Madison, then in the House of Representatives, as well as\r\nothers, had opposed it on that ground. General Washington, as President,\r\nwas called on to approve or reject it. He sought and obtained on the\r\nconstitutionality question the separate written opinions of Jefferson,\r\nHamilton, and Edmund Randolph,--they then being respectively Secretary of\r\nState, Secretary of the Treasury, and Attorney general. Hamilton's opinion\r\nwas for the power; while Randolph's and Jefferson's were both against\r\nit. Mr. Jefferson, after giving his opinion deciding only against the\r\nconstitutionality of the bill, closes his letter with the paragraph which\r\nI now read:\r\n\r\n\"It must be admitted, however, that unless the President's mind, on a view\r\nof everything which is urged for and against this bill, is tolerably clear\r\nthat it is unauthorized by the Constitution,--if the pro and con hang\r\nso even as to balance his judgment, a just respect for the wisdom of the\r\nlegislature would naturally decide the balance in favor of their opinion.\r\nIt is chiefly for cases where they are clearly misled by error, ambition,\r\nor interest, that the Constitution has placed a check in the negative of\r\nthe President.\r\n\r\n\"THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\"February 15, 1791.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Taylor's opinion, as expressed in his Allison letter, is as I now\r\nread:\r\n\r\n\"The power given by the veto is a high conservative power; but, in my\r\nopinion, should never be exercised except in cases of clear violation\r\nof the Constitution, or manifest haste and want of consideration by\r\nCongress.\"\r\n\r\nIt is here seen that, in Mr. Jefferson's opinion, if on the\r\nconstitutionality of any given bill the President doubts, he is not to\r\nveto it, as the gentleman from Kentucky would have him do, but is to defer\r\nto Congress and approve it. And if we compare the opinion of Jefferson and\r\nTaylor, as expressed in these paragraphs, we shall find them more exactly\r\nalike than we can often find any two expressions having any literal\r\ndifference. None but interested faultfinders, I think, can discover any\r\nsubstantial variation.\r\n\r\nBut gentlemen on the other side are unanimously agreed that General Taylor\r\nhas no other principles. They are in utter darkness as to his opinions on\r\nany of the questions of policy which occupy the public attention. But\r\nis there any doubt as to what he will do on the prominent questions if\r\nelected? Not the least. It is not possible to know what he will or would\r\ndo in every imaginable case, because many questions have passed away, and\r\nothers doubtless will arise which none of us have yet thought of; but on\r\nthe prominent questions of currency, tariff, internal improvements, and\r\nWilmot Proviso, General Taylor's course is at least as well defined as is\r\nGeneral Cass's. Why, in their eagerness to get at General Taylor, several\r\nDemocratic members here have desired to know whether, in case of his\r\nelection, a bankrupt law is to be established. Can they tell us General\r\nCass's opinion on this question?\r\n\r\n[Some member answered, \"He is against it.\"]\r\n\r\nAye, how do you know he is? There is nothing about it in the platform, nor\r\nelsewhere, that I have seen. If the gentleman knows of anything which I\r\ndo not know he can show it. But to return. General Taylor, in his Allison\r\nletter, says:\r\n\r\n\"Upon the subject of the tariff, the currency, the improvement of our\r\ngreat highways, rivers, lakes, and harbors, the will of the people, as\r\nexpressed through their representatives in Congress, ought to be respected\r\nand carried out by the executive.\"\r\n\r\nNow this is the whole matter. In substance, it is this: The people say to\r\nGeneral Taylor, \"If you are elected, shall we have a national bank?\" He\r\nanswers, \"Your will, gentlemen, not mine.\" \"What about the tariff?\" \"Say\r\nyourselves.\" \"Shall our rivers and harbors be improved?\" \"Just as you\r\nplease. If you desire a bank, an alteration of the tariff, internal\r\nimprovements, any or all, I will not hinder you. If you do not desire\r\nthem, I will not attempt to force them on you. Send up your members of\r\nCongress from the various districts, with opinions according to your own,\r\nand if they are for these measures, or any of them, I shall have nothing\r\nto oppose; if they are not for them, I shall not, by any appliances\r\nwhatever, attempt to dragoon them into their adoption.\"\r\n\r\nNow can there be any difficulty in understanding this? To you Democrats\r\nit may not seem like principle; but surely you cannot fail to perceive the\r\nposition plainly enough. The distinction between it and the position of\r\nyour candidate is broad and obvious, and I admit you have a clear right to\r\nshow it is wrong if you can; but you have no right to pretend you cannot\r\nsee it at all. We see it, and to us it appears like principle, and the\r\nbest sort of principle at that--the principle of allowing the people to\r\ndo as they please with their own business. My friend from Indiana (C. B.\r\nSmith) has aptly asked, \"Are you willing to trust the people?\" Some of\r\nyou answered substantially, \"We are willing to trust the people; but the\r\nPresident is as much the representative of the people as Congress.\" In a\r\ncertain sense, and to a certain extent, he is the representative of the\r\npeople. He is elected by them, as well as Congress is; but can he, in the\r\nnature of things know the wants of the people as well as three hundred\r\nother men, coming from all the various localities of the nation? If so,\r\nwhere is the propriety of having a Congress? That the Constitution gives\r\nthe President a negative on legislation, all know; but that this negative\r\nshould be so combined with platforms and other appliances as to enable\r\nhim, and in fact almost compel him, to take the whole of legislation into\r\nhis own hands, is what we object to, is what General Taylor objects to,\r\nand is what constitutes the broad distinction between you and us. To thus\r\ntransfer legislation is clearly to take it from those who understand with\r\nminuteness the interests of the people, and give it to one who does\r\nnot and cannot so well understand it. I understand your idea that if a\r\nPresidential candidate avow his opinion upon a given question, or rather\r\nupon all questions, and the people, with full knowledge of this, elect\r\nhim, they thereby distinctly approve all those opinions. By means of it,\r\nmeasures are adopted or rejected contrary to the wishes of the whole of\r\none party, and often nearly half of the other. Three, four, or half a\r\ndozen questions are prominent at a given time; the party selects its\r\ncandidate, and he takes his position on each of these questions. On all\r\nbut one his positions have already been indorsed at former elections,\r\nand his party fully committed to them; but that one is new, and a large\r\nportion of them are against it. But what are they to do? The whole was\r\nstrung together; and they must take all, or reject all. They cannot take\r\nwhat they like, and leave the rest. What they are already committed\r\nto being the majority, they shut their eyes, and gulp the whole. Next\r\nelection, still another is introduced in the same way. If we run our eyes\r\nalong the line of the past, we shall see that almost if not quite all the\r\narticles of the present Democratic creed have been at first forced upon\r\nthe party in this very way. And just now, and just so, opposition to\r\ninternal improvements is to be established if General Cass shall be\r\nelected. Almost half the Democrats here are for improvements; but they\r\nwill vote for Cass, and if he succeeds, their vote will have aided in\r\nclosing the doors against improvements. Now this is a process which we\r\nthink is wrong. We prefer a candidate who, like General Taylor, will allow\r\nthe people to have their own way, regardless of his private opinions;\r\nand I should think the internal-improvement Democrats, at least, ought to\r\nprefer such a candidate. He would force nothing on them which they\r\ndon't want, and he would allow them to have improvements which their own\r\ncandidate, if elected, will not.\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, I have said General Taylor's position is as well defined as\r\nis that of General Cass. In saying this, I admit I do not certainly know\r\nwhat he would do on the Wilmot Proviso. I am a Northern man or rather\r\na Western Free-State man, with a constituency I believe to be, and with\r\npersonal feelings I know to be, against the extension of slavery. As such,\r\nand with what information I have, I hope and believe General Taylor, if\r\nelected, would not veto the proviso. But I do not know it. Yet if I\r\nknew he would, I still would vote for him. I should do so because, in my\r\njudgment, his election alone can defeat General Cass; and because,\r\nshould slavery thereby go to the territory we now have, just so much will\r\ncertainly happen by the election of Cass, and in addition a course of\r\npolicy leading to new wars, new acquisitions of territory and still\r\nfurther extensions of slavery. One of the two is to be President. Which is\r\npreferable?\r\n\r\nBut there is as much doubt of Cass on improvements as there is of Taylor\r\non the proviso. I have no doubt myself of General Cass on this question;\r\nbut I know the Democrats differ among themselves as to his position. My\r\ninternal-improvement colleague [Mr. Wentworth] stated on this floor the\r\nother day that he was satisfied Cass was for improvements, because he had\r\nvoted for all the bills that he [Mr. Wentworth] had. So far so good. But\r\nMr. Polk vetoed some of these very bills. The Baltimore convention passed\r\na set of resolutions, among other things, approving these vetoes, and\r\nGeneral Cass declares, in his letter accepting the nomination, that he has\r\ncarefully read these resolutions, and that he adheres to them as firmly\r\nas he approves them cordially. In other words, General Cass voted for the\r\nbills, and thinks the President did right to veto them; and his friends\r\nhere are amiable enough to consider him as being on one side or the\r\nother, just as one or the other may correspond with their own respective\r\ninclinations. My colleague admits that the platform declares against the\r\nconstitutionality of a general system of improvements, and that General\r\nCass indorses the platform; but he still thinks General Cass is in favor\r\nof some sort of improvements. Well, what are they? As he is against\r\ngeneral objects, those he is for must be particular and local. Now this is\r\ntaking the subject precisely by the wrong end. Particularity expending the\r\nmoney of the whole people for an object which will benefit only a portion\r\nof them--is the greatest real objection to improvements, and has been so\r\nheld by General Jackson, Mr. Polk, and all others, I believe, till\r\nnow. But now, behold, the objects most general--nearest free from this\r\nobjection--are to be rejected, while those most liable to it are to be\r\nembraced. To return: I cannot help believing that General Cass, when he\r\nwrote his letter of acceptance, well understood he was to be claimed by\r\nthe advocates of both sides of this question, and that he then closed the\r\ndoor against all further expressions of opinion purposely to retain\r\nthe benefits of that double position. His subsequent equivocation at\r\nCleveland, to my mind, proves such to have been the case.\r\n\r\nOne word more, and I shall have done with this branch of the subject. You\r\nDemocrats, and your candidate, in the main are in favor of laying down\r\nin advance a platform--a set of party positions--as a unit, and then of\r\nforcing the people, by every sort of appliance, to ratify them, however\r\nunpalatable some of them may be. We and our candidate are in favor of\r\nmaking Presidential elections and the legislation of the country distinct\r\nmatters; so that the people can elect whom they please, and afterward\r\nlegislate just as they please, without any hindrance, save only so much as\r\nmay guard against infractions of the Constitution, undue haste, and want\r\nof consideration. The difference between us is clear as noonday. That\r\nwe are right we cannot doubt. We hold the true Republican position. In\r\nleaving the people's business in their hands, we cannot be wrong. We are\r\nwilling, and even anxious, to go to the people on this issue.\r\n\r\nBut I suppose I cannot reasonably hope to convince you that we have any\r\nprinciples. The most I can expect is to assure you that we think we have\r\nand are quite contented with them. The other day one of the gentlemen from\r\nGeorgia [Mr. Iverson], an eloquent man, and a man of learning, so far as\r\nI can judge, not being learned myself, came down upon us astonishingly. He\r\nspoke in what the 'Baltimore American' calls the \"scathing and withering\r\nstyle.\" At the end of his second severe flash I was struck blind, and\r\nfound myself feeling with my fingers for an assurance of my continued\r\nexistence. A little of the bone was left, and I gradually revived. He\r\neulogized Mr. Clay in high and beautiful terms, and then declared that we\r\nhad deserted all our principles, and had turned Henry Clay out, like an\r\nold horse, to root. This is terribly severe. It cannot be answered\r\nby argument--at least I cannot so answer it. I merely wish to ask the\r\ngentleman if the Whigs are the only party he can think of who sometimes\r\nturn old horses out to root. Is not a certain Martin Van Buren an old\r\nhorse which your own party have turned out to root? and is he not rooting\r\na little to your discomfort about now? But in not nominating Mr. Clay\r\nwe deserted our principles, you say. Ah! In what? Tell us, ye men of\r\nprinciple, what principle we violated. We say you did violate principle in\r\ndiscarding Van Buren, and we can tell you how. You violated the\r\nprimary, the cardinal, the one great living principle of all democratic\r\nrepresentative government--the principle that the representative is bound\r\nto carry out the known will of his constituents. A large majority of the\r\nBaltimore convention of 1844 were, by their constituents, instructed to\r\nprocure Van Buren 's nomination if they could. In violation--in utter\r\nglaring contempt of this, you rejected him; rejected him, as the gentleman\r\nfrom New York [Mr. Birdsall] the other day expressly admitted, for\r\navailability--that same \"general availability\" which you charge upon\r\nus, and daily chew over here, as something exceedingly odious and\r\nunprincipled. But the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Iverson] gave us a\r\nsecond speech yesterday, all well considered and put down in writing, in\r\nwhich Van Buren was scathed and withered a \"few\" for his present position\r\nand movements. I cannot remember the gentleman's precise language; but\r\nI do remember he put Van Buren down, down, till he got him where he was\r\nfinally to \"stink\" and \"rot.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, it is no business or inclination of mine to defend Martin\r\nVan Buren in the war of extermination now waging between him and his old\r\nadmirers. I say, \"Devil take the hindmost\"--and the foremost. But there is\r\nno mistaking the origin of the breach; and if the curse of \"stinking\" and\r\n\"rotting\" is to fall on the first and greatest violators of principle in\r\nthe matter, I disinterestedly suggest that the gentleman from Georgia\r\nand his present co-workers are bound to take it upon themselves. But the\r\ngentleman from Georgia further says we have deserted all our principles,\r\nand taken shelter under General Taylor's military coat-tail, and he seems\r\nto think this is exceedingly degrading. Well, as his faith is, so be it\r\nunto him. But can he remember no other military coat-tail under which a\r\ncertain other party have been sheltering for near a quarter of a century?\r\nHas he no acquaintance with the ample military coat tail of General\r\nJackson? Does he not know that his own party have run the five last\r\nPresidential races under that coat-tail, and that they are now running the\r\nsixth under the same cover? Yes, sir, that coat-tail was used not only for\r\nGeneral Jackson himself, but has been clung to, with the grip of death,\r\nby every Democratic candidate since. You have never ventured, and dare not\r\nnow venture, from under it. Your campaign papers have constantly been \"Old\r\nHickories,\" with rude likenesses of the old general upon them; hickory\r\npoles and hickory brooms your never-ending emblems; Mr. Polk himself was\r\n\"Young Hickory,\" or something so; and even now your campaign paper here\r\nis proclaiming that Cass and Butler are of the true \"Hickory stripe.\" Now,\r\nsir, you dare not give it up. Like a horde of hungry ticks you have stuck\r\nto the tail of the Hermitage Lion to the end of his life; and you are\r\nstill sticking to it, and drawing a loathsome sustenance from it, after he\r\nis dead. A fellow once advertised that he had made a discovery by which he\r\ncould make a new man out of an old one, and have enough of the stuff left\r\nto make a little yellow dog. Just such a discovery has General Jackson's\r\npopularity been to you. You not only twice made President of him out\r\nof it, but you have had enough of the stuff left to make Presidents of\r\nseveral comparatively small men since; and it is your chief reliance now\r\nto make still another.\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, old horses and military coat-tails, or tails of any sort,\r\nare not figures of speech such as I would be the first to introduce into\r\ndiscussions here; but as the gentleman from Georgia has thought fit to\r\nintroduce them, he and you are welcome to all you have made, or can make\r\nby them. If you have any more old horses, trot them out; any more tails,\r\njust cock them and come at us. I repeat, I would not introduce this mode\r\nof discussion here; but I wish gentlemen on the other side to understand\r\nthat the use of degrading figures is a game at which they may not find\r\nthemselves able to take all the winnings.\r\n\r\n[\"We give it up!\"]\r\n\r\nAye, you give it up, and well you may; but for a very different reason\r\nfrom that which you would have us understand. The point--the power to\r\nhurt--of all figures consists in the truthfulness of their application;\r\nand, understanding this, you may well give it up. They are weapons which\r\nhit you, but miss us.\r\n\r\nBut in my hurry I was very near closing this subject of military tails\r\nbefore I was done with it. There is one entire article of the sort I have\r\nnot discussed yet,--I mean the military tail you Democrats are now engaged\r\nin dovetailing into the great Michigander [Cass]. Yes, sir; all his\r\nbiographies (and they are legion) have him in hand, tying him to a\r\nmilitary tail, like so many mischievous boys tying a dog to a bladder of\r\nbeans. True, the material they have is very limited, but they drive at it\r\nmight and main. He invaded Canada without resistance, and he outvaded it\r\nwithout pursuit. As he did both under orders, I suppose there was to him\r\nneither credit nor discredit in them; but they constitute a large part\r\nof the tail. He was not at Hull's surrender, but he was close by; he was\r\nvolunteer aid to General Harrison on the day of the battle of the Thames;\r\nand as you said in 1840 Harrison was picking huckleberries two miles off\r\nwhile the battle was fought, I suppose it is a just conclusion with you\r\nto say Cass was aiding Harrison to pick huckleberries. This is about all,\r\nexcept the mooted question of the broken sword. Some authors say he broke\r\nit, some say he threw it away, and some others, who ought to know, say\r\nnothing about it. Perhaps it would be a fair historical compromise to say,\r\nif he did not break it, he did not do anything else with it.\r\n\r\nBy the way, Mr. Speaker, did you know I am a military hero? Yes, sir; in\r\nthe days of the Black Hawk war I fought, bled, and came away. Speaking\r\nof General Cass's career reminds me of my own. I was not at Stiliman's\r\ndefeat, but I was about as near it as Cass was to Hull's surrender; and,\r\nlike him, I saw the place very soon afterward. It is quite certain I did\r\nnot break my sword, for I had none to break; but I bent a musket pretty\r\nbadly on one occasion. If Cass broke his sword, the idea is he broke it\r\nin desperation; I bent the musket by accident. If General Cass went in\r\nadvance of me in picking huckleberries, I guess I surpassed him in charges\r\nupon the wild onions. If he saw any live, fighting Indians, it was more\r\nthan I did; but I had a good many bloody struggles with the mosquitoes,\r\nand although I never fainted from the loss of blood, I can truly say I was\r\noften very hungry. Mr. Speaker, if I should ever conclude to doff whatever\r\nour Democratic friends may suppose there is of black-cockade federalism\r\nabout me, and therefore they shall take me up as their candidate for\r\nthe Presidency, I protest they shall not make fun of me, as they have of\r\nGeneral Cass, by attempting to write me into a military hero.\r\n\r\nWhile I have General Cass in hand, I wish to say a word about his\r\npolitical principles. As a specimen, I take the record of his progress in\r\nthe Wilmot Proviso. In the Washington Union of March 2, 1847, there is a\r\nreport of a speech of General Cass, made the day before in the Senate, on\r\nthe Wilmot Proviso, during the delivery of which Mr. Miller of New Jersey\r\nis reported to have interrupted him as follows, to wit:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Miller expressed his great surprise at the change in the sentiments\r\nof the Senator from Michigan, who had been regarded as the great champion\r\nof freedom in the Northwest, of which he was a distinguished ornament.\r\nLast year the Senator from Michigan was understood to be decidedly in\r\nfavor of the Wilmot Proviso; and as no reason had been stated for the\r\nchange, he [Mr. Miller] could not refrain from the expression of his\r\nextreme surprise.\"\r\n\r\nTo this General Cass is reported to have replied as follows, to wit:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Cass said that the course of the Senator from New Jersey was\r\nmost extraordinary. Last year he [Mr. Cass] should have voted for the\r\nproposition, had it come up. But circumstances had altogether changed. The\r\nhonorable Senator then read several passages from the remarks, as given\r\nabove, which he had committed to writing, in order to refute such a charge\r\nas that of the Senator from New Jersey.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"remarks above reduced to writing\" is one numbered four, as\r\nfollows, to wit:\r\n\r\n\"Fourth. Legislation now would be wholly inoperative, because no territory\r\nhereafter to be acquired can be governed without an act of Congress\r\nproviding for its government; and such an act, on its passage, would open\r\nthe whole subject, and leave the Congress called on to pass it free to\r\nexercise its own discretion, entirely uncontrolled by any declaration\r\nfound on the statute-book.\"\r\n\r\nIn Niles's Register, vol. lxxiii., p. 293, there is a letter of General\r\nCass to ------ Nicholson, of Nashville, Tennessee, dated December 24, 1847,\r\nfrom which the following are correct extracts:\r\n\r\n\"The Wilmot Proviso has been before the country some time. It has been\r\nrepeatedly discussed in Congress and by the public press. I am strongly\r\nimpressed with the opinion that a great change has been going on in the\r\npublic mind upon this subject,--in my own as well as others',--and that\r\ndoubts are resolving themselves into convictions that the principle it\r\ninvolves should be kept out of the national legislature, and left to\r\nthe people of the confederacy in their respective local governments....\r\nBriefly, then, I am opposed to the exercise of any jurisdiction by\r\nCongress over this matter; and I am in favor of leaving the people of\r\nany territory which may be hereafter acquired the right to regulate\r\nit themselves, under the general principles of the Constitution.\r\nBecause--'First. I do not see in the Constitution any grant of the\r\nrequisite power to Congress; and I am not disposed to extend a doubtful\r\nprecedent beyond its necessity,--the establishment of territorial\r\ngovernments when needed,--leaving to the inhabitants all the right\r\ncompatible with the relations they bear to the confederation.\"\r\n\r\nThese extracts show that in 1846 General Cass was for the proviso at once;\r\nthat in March, 1847, he was still for it, but not just then; and that in\r\nDecember, 1847, he was against it altogether. This is a true index to the\r\nwhole man. When the question was raised in 1846, he was in a blustering\r\nhurry to take ground for it. He sought to be in advance, and to avoid\r\nthe uninteresting position of a mere follower; but soon he began to see\r\nglimpses of the great Democratic ox-goad waving in his face, and to hear\r\nindistinctly a voice saying, \"Back! Back, sir! Back a little!\" He shakes\r\nhis head, and bats his eyes, and blunders back to his position of March,\r\n1847; but still the goad waves, and the voice grows more distinct and\r\nsharper still, \"Back, sir! Back, I say! Further back!\"--and back he goes\r\nto the position of December, 1847, at which the goad is still, and the\r\nvoice soothingly says, \"So! Stand at that!\"\r\n\r\nHave no fears, gentlemen, of your candidate. He exactly suits you, and\r\nwe congratulate you upon it. However much you may be distressed about our\r\ncandidate, you have all cause to be contented and happy with your own. If\r\nelected, he may not maintain all or even any of his positions previously\r\ntaken; but he will be sure to do whatever the party exigency for the time\r\nbeing may require; and that is precisely what you want. He and Van Buren\r\nare the same \"manner of men\"; and, like Van Buren, he will never desert\r\nyou till you first desert him.\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, I adopt the suggestion of a friend, that General Cass is a\r\ngeneral of splendidly successful charges--charges, to be sure, not\r\nupon the public enemy, but upon the public treasury. He was Governor of\r\nMichigan territory, and ex-officio Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\r\nfrom the 9th of October, 1813, till the 31st of July, 1831--a period of\r\nseventeen years, nine months, and twenty-two days. During this period\r\nhe received from the United States treasury, for personal services and\r\npersonal expenses, the aggregate sum of ninety-six thousand and twenty\r\neight dollars, being an average of fourteen dollars and seventy-nine cents\r\nper day for every day of the time. This large sum was reached by assuming\r\nthat he was doing service at several different places, and in several\r\ndifferent capacities in the same place, all at the same time. By a correct\r\nanalysis of his accounts during that period, the following propositions\r\nmay be deduced:\r\n\r\nFirst. He was paid in three different capacities during the whole of the\r\ntime: that is to say--(1) As governor a salary at the rate per year\r\nof $2000. (2) As estimated for office rent, clerk hire, fuel, etc., in\r\nsuperintendence of Indian affairs in Michigan, at the rate per year of\r\n$1500. (3) As compensation and expenses for various miscellaneous items of\r\nIndian service out of Michigan, an average per year of $625.\r\n\r\nSecond. During part of the time--that is, from the 9th of October, 1813,\r\nto the 29th of May, 1822 he was paid in four different capacities; that is\r\nto say, the three as above, and, in addition thereto, the commutation of\r\nten rations per day, amounting per year to $730.\r\n\r\nThird. During another part of the time--that is, from the beginning\r\nof 1822 to the 31st of July, '83 he was also paid in four different\r\ncapacities; that is to say, the first three, as above (the rations being\r\ndropped after the 29th of May, 1822), and, in addition thereto, for\r\nsuperintending Indian Agencies at Piqua, Ohio; Fort Wayne, Indiana; and\r\nChicago, Illinois, at the rate per year of $1500. It should be observed\r\nhere that the last item, commencing at the beginning of 1822, and the item\r\nof rations, ending on the 29th of May, 1822, lap on each other during so\r\nmuch of the time as lies between those two dates.\r\n\r\nFourth. Still another part of the time--that is, from the 31st of October,\r\n1821, to the 29th of May, 1822--he was paid in six different capacities;\r\nthat is to say, the three first, as above; the item of rations, as above;\r\nand, in addition thereto, another item of ten rations per day while at\r\nWashington settling his accounts, being at the rate per year of $730; and\r\nalso an allowance for expenses traveling to and from Washington, and while\r\nthere, of $1022, being at the rate per year of $1793.\r\n\r\nFifth. And yet during the little portion of the time which lies between\r\nthe 1st of January, 1822, and the 29th of May, 1822, he was paid in seven\r\ndifferent capacities; that is to say, the six last mentioned, and also,\r\nat the rate of $1500 per year, for the Piqua, Fort Wayne, and Chicago\r\nservice, as mentioned above.\r\n\r\nThese accounts have already been discussed some here; but when we are\r\namongst them, as when we are in the Patent Office, we must peep about a\r\ngood deal before we can see all the curiosities. I shall not be tedious\r\nwith them. As to the large item of $1500 per year--amounting in the\r\naggregate to $26,715 for office rent, clerk hire, fuel, etc., I barely\r\nwish to remark that, so far as I can discover in the public documents,\r\nthere is no evidence, by word or inference, either from any disinterested\r\nwitness or of General Cass himself, that he ever rented or kept a separate\r\noffice, ever hired or kept a clerk, or even used any extra amount of fuel,\r\netc., in consequence of his Indian services. Indeed, General Cass's entire\r\nsilence in regard to these items, in his two long letters urging his\r\nclaims upon the government, is, to my mind, almost conclusive that no such\r\nclaims had any real existence.\r\n\r\nBut I have introduced General Cass's accounts here chiefly to show the\r\nwonderful physical capacities of the man. They show that he not only did\r\nthe labor of several men at the same time, but that he often did it at\r\nseveral places, many hundreds of miles apart, at the same time. And at\r\neating, too, his capacities are shown to be quite as wonderful. From\r\nOctober, 1821, to May, 1822, he eat ten rations a day in Michigan, ten\r\nrations a day here in Washington, and near five dollars' worth a day on\r\nthe road between the two places! And then there is an important discovery\r\nin his example--the art of being paid for what one eats, instead of having\r\nto pay for it. Hereafter if any nice young man should owe a bill which\r\nhe cannot pay in any other way, he can just board it out. Mr. Speaker, we\r\nhave all heard of the animal standing in doubt between two stacks of hay\r\nand starving to death. The like of that would never happen to General\r\nCass. Place the stacks a thousand miles apart, he would stand stock-still\r\nmidway between them, and eat them both at once, and the green grass along\r\nthe line would be apt to suffer some, too, at the same time. By all means\r\nmake him President, gentlemen. He will feed you bounteously--if--if there\r\nis any left after he shall have helped himself.\r\n\r\nBut, as General Taylor is, par excellence, the hero of the Mexican War,\r\nand as you Democrats say we Whigs have always opposed the war, you think\r\nit must be very awkward and embarrassing for us to go for General Taylor.\r\nThe declaration that we have always opposed the war is true or false,\r\naccording as one may understand the term \"oppose the war.\" If to say \"the\r\nwar was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced by the President\"\r\nby opposing the war, then the Whigs have very generally opposed it.\r\nWhenever they have spoken at all, they have said this; and they have said\r\nit on what has appeared good reason to them. The marching an army into the\r\nmidst of a peaceful Mexican settlement, frightening the inhabitants away,\r\nleaving their growing crops and other property to destruction, to you may\r\nappear a perfectly amiable, peaceful, unprovoking procedure; but it does\r\nnot appear so to us. So to call such an act, to us appears no other than\r\na naked, impudent absurdity, and we speak of it accordingly. But if, when\r\nthe war had begun, and had become the cause of the country, the giving\r\nof our money and our blood, in common with yours, was support of the\r\nwar, then it is not true that we have always opposed the war. With few\r\nindividual exceptions, you have constantly had our votes here for all the\r\nnecessary supplies. And, more than this, you have had the services, the\r\nblood, and the lives of our political brethren in every trial and on\r\nevery field. The beardless boy and the mature man, the humble and the\r\ndistinguished--you have had them. Through suffering and death, by disease\r\nand in battle they have endured and fought and fell with you. Clay and\r\nWebster each gave a son, never to be returned. From the State of my\r\nown residence, besides other worthy but less known Whig names, we sent\r\nMarshall, Morrison, Baker, and Hardin; they all fought, and one fell, and\r\nin the fall of that one we lost our best Whig man. Nor were the Whigs\r\nfew in number, or laggard in the day of danger. In that fearful, bloody,\r\nbreathless struggle at Buena Vista, where each man's hard task was to beat\r\nback five foes or die himself, of the five high officers who perished,\r\nfour were Whigs.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of this, I mean no odious comparison between the lion-hearted\r\nWhigs and the Democrats who fought there. On other occasions, and\r\namong the lower officers and privates on that occasion, I doubt not the\r\nproportion was different. I wish to do justice to all. I think of all\r\nthose brave men as Americans, in whose proud fame, as an American, I too\r\nhave a share. Many of them, Whigs and Democrats are my constituents and\r\npersonal friends; and I thank them,--more than thank them,--one and all,\r\nfor the high imperishable honor they have conferred on our common State.\r\n\r\nBut the distinction between the cause of the President in beginning the\r\nwar, and the cause of the country after it was begun, is a distinction\r\nwhich you cannot perceive. To you the President and the country seem to\r\nbe all one. You are interested to see no distinction between them; and I\r\nventure to suggest that probably your interest blinds you a little. We\r\nsee the distinction, as we think, clearly enough; and our friends who have\r\nfought in the war have no difficulty in seeing it also. What those who\r\nhave fallen would say, were they alive and here, of course we can never\r\nknow; but with those who have returned there is no difficulty. Colonel\r\nHaskell and Major Gaines, members here, both fought in the war, and both\r\nof them underwent extraordinary perils and hardships; still they, like all\r\nother Whigs here, vote, on the record, that the war was unnecessarily and\r\nunconstitutionally commenced by the President. And even General Taylor\r\nhimself, the noblest Roman of them all, has declared that as a citizen,\r\nand particularly as a soldier, it is sufficient for him to know that his\r\ncountry is at war with a foreign nation, to do all in his power to\r\nbring it to a speedy and honorable termination by the most vigorous and\r\nenergetic operations, without inquiry about its justice, or anything else\r\nconnected with it.\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, let our Democratic friends be comforted with the assurance\r\nthat we are content with our position, content with our company, and\r\ncontent with our candidate; and that although they, in their generous\r\nsympathy, think we ought to be miserable, we really are not, and that they\r\nmay dismiss the great anxiety they have on our account.\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, I see I have but three minutes left, and this forces me to\r\nthrow out one whole branch of my subject. A single word on still another.\r\nThe Democrats are keen enough to frequently remind us that we have some\r\ndissensions in our ranks. Our good friend from Baltimore immediately\r\nbefore me [Mr. McLane] expressed some doubt the other day as to which\r\nbranch of our party General Taylor would ultimately fall into the hands\r\nof. That was a new idea to me. I knew we had dissenters, but I did not\r\nknow they were trying to get our candidate away from us. I would like\r\nto say a word to our dissenters, but I have not the time. Some such we\r\ncertainly have; have you none, gentlemen Democrats? Is it all union and\r\nharmony in your ranks? no bickerings? no divisions? If there be doubt as\r\nto which of our divisions will get our candidate, is there no doubt as\r\nto which of your candidates will get your party? I have heard some things\r\nfrom New York; and if they are true, one might well say of your party\r\nthere, as a drunken fellow once said when he heard the reading of an\r\nindictment for hog-stealing. The clerk read on till he got to and through\r\nthe words, \"did steal, take, and carry away ten boars, ten sows, ten\r\nshoats, and ten pigs,\" at which he exclaimed, \"Well, by golly, that is\r\nthe most equally divided gang of hogs I ever did hear of!\" If there is any\r\nother gang of hogs more equally divided than the Democrats of New York are\r\nabout this time, I have not heard of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH DELIVERED AT WORCESTER, MASS., ON SEPT. 12, 1848.\r\n\r\n(From the Boston Advertiser.)\r\n\r\nMr. Kellogg then introduced to the meeting the Hon. Abram Lincoln, Whig\r\nmember of Congress from Illinois, a representative of free soil.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln has a very tall and thin figure, with an intellectual face,\r\nshowing a searching mind, and a cool judgment. He spoke in a clear and\r\ncool and very eloquent manner, for an hour and a half, carrying the\r\naudience with him in his able arguments and brilliant illustrations--only\r\ninterrupted by warm and frequent applause. He began by expressing a real\r\nfeeling of modesty in addressing an audience \"this side of the mountains,\"\r\na part of the country where, in the opinion of the people of his section,\r\neverybody was supposed to be instructed and wise. But he had devoted his\r\nattention to the question of the coming Presidential election, and was\r\nnot unwilling to exchange with all whom he might the ideas to which he\r\nhad arrived. He then began to show the fallacy of some of the arguments\r\nagainst Gen. Taylor, making his chief theme the fashionable statement of\r\nall those who oppose him (\"the old Locofocos as well as the new\") that he\r\nhas no principles, and that the Whig party have abandoned their principles\r\nby adopting him as their candidate. He maintained that Gen. Taylor\r\noccupied a high and unexceptionable Whig ground, and took for his first\r\ninstance and proof of this the statement in the Allison letter--with\r\nregard to the bank, tariff, rivers and harbors, etc.--that the will of the\r\npeople should produce its own results, without executive influence. The\r\nprinciple that the people should do what--under the Constitution--as they\r\nplease, is a Whig principle. All that Gen. Taylor is not only to consent\r\nto, but appeal to the people to judge and act for themselves. And this was\r\nno new doctrine for Whigs. It was the \"platform\" on which they had\r\nfought all their battles, the resistance of executive influence, and the\r\nprinciple of enabling the people to frame the government according to\r\ntheir will. Gen. Taylor consents to be the candidate, and to assist the\r\npeople to do what they think to be their duty, and think to be best in\r\ntheir national affairs, but because he don't want to tell what we ought to\r\ndo, he is accused of having no principles. The Whigs here maintained for\r\nyears that neither the influence, the duress, or the prohibition of the\r\nexecutive should control the legitimately expressed will of the people;\r\nand now that, on that very ground, Gen. Taylor says that he should use the\r\npower given him by the people to do, to the best of his judgment, the will\r\nof the people, he is accused of want of principle, and of inconsistency in\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln proceeded to examine the absurdity of an attempt to make a\r\nplatform or creed for a national party, to all parts of which all\r\nmust consent and agree, when it was clearly the intention and the true\r\nphilosophy of our government, that in Congress all opinions and principles\r\nshould be represented, and that when the wisdom of all had been compared\r\nand united, the will of the majority should be carried out. On this ground\r\nhe conceived (and the audience seemed to go with him) that Gen. Taylor\r\nheld correct, sound republican principles.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln then passed to the subject of slavery in the States,\r\nsaying that the people of Illinois agreed entirely with the people of\r\nMassachusetts on this subject, except perhaps that they did not keep so\r\nconstantly thinking about it. All agreed that slavery was an evil, but\r\nthat we were not responsible for it and cannot affect it in States of this\r\nUnion where we do not live. But the question of the extension of slavery\r\nto new territories of this country is a part of our responsibility and\r\ncare, and is under our control. In opposition to this Mr. L. believed that\r\nthe self-named \"Free Soil\" party was far behind the Whigs. Both parties\r\nopposed the extension. As he understood it the new party had no principle\r\nexcept this opposition. If their platform held any other, it was in such\r\na general way that it was like the pair of pantaloons the Yankee pedlar\r\noffered for sale, \"large enough for any man, small enough for any boy.\"\r\nThey therefore had taken a position calculated to break down their single\r\nimportant declared object. They were working for the election of either\r\nGen. Cass or Gen. Taylor. The speaker then went on to show, clearly and\r\neloquently, the danger of extension of slavery, likely to result from the\r\nelection of Gen. Cass. To unite with those who annexed the new territory\r\nto prevent the extension of slavery in that territory seemed to him to\r\nbe in the highest degree absurd and ridiculous. Suppose these gentlemen\r\nsucceed in electing Mr. Van Buren, they had no specific means to prevent\r\nthe extension of slavery to New Mexico and California, and Gen. Taylor, he\r\nconfidently believed, would not encourage it, and would not prohibit its\r\nrestriction. But if Gen. Cass was elected, he felt certain that the plans\r\nof farther extension of territory would be encouraged, and those of the\r\nextension of slavery would meet no check. The \"Free Soil\" mart in claiming\r\nthat name indirectly attempts a deception, by implying that Whigs were\r\nnot Free Soil men. Declaring that they would \"do their duty and leave the\r\nconsequences to God\" merely gave an excuse for taking a course they were\r\nnot able to maintain by a fair and full argument. To make this declaration\r\ndid not show what their duty was. If it did we should have no use for\r\njudgment, we might as well be made without intellect; and when divine or\r\nhuman law does not clearly point out what is our duty, we have no means of\r\nfinding out what it is but by using our most intelligent judgment of the\r\nconsequences. If there were divine law or human law for voting for Martin\r\nVan Buren, or if a fair examination of the consequences and just reasoning\r\nwould show that voting for him would bring about the ends they pretended\r\nto wish--then he would give up the argument. But since there was no fixed\r\nlaw on the subject, and since the whole probable result of their action\r\nwould be an assistance in electing Gen. Cass, he must say that they were\r\nbehind the Whigs in their advocacy of the freedom of the soil.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln proceeded to rally the Buffalo convention for forbearing to\r\nsay anything--after all the previous declarations of those members who\r\nwere formerly Whigs--on the subject of the Mexican War, because the Van\r\nBurens had been known to have supported it. He declared that of all the\r\nparties asking the confidence of the country, this new one had less of\r\nprinciple than any other.\r\n\r\nHe wondered whether it was still the opinion of these Free Soil gentlemen,\r\nas declared in the \"whereas\" at Buffalo, that the Whig and Democratic\r\nparties were both entirely dissolved and absorbed into their own body. Had\r\nthe Vermont election given them any light? They had calculated on making\r\nas great an impression in that State as in any part of the Union, and\r\nthere their attempts had been wholly ineffectual. Their failure was a\r\ngreater success than they would find in any other part of the Union.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln went on to say that he honestly believed that all those who\r\nwished to keep up the character of the Union; who did not believe\r\nin enlarging our field, but in keeping our fences where they are and\r\ncultivating our present possessions, making it a garden, improving the\r\nmorals and education of the people, devoting the administrations to this\r\npurpose; all real Whigs, friends of good honest government--the race was\r\nours. He had opportunities of hearing from almost every part of the Union\r\nfrom reliable sources and had not heard of a county in which we had not\r\nreceived accessions from other parties. If the true Whigs come forward\r\nand join these new friends, they need not have a doubt. We had a candidate\r\nwhose personal character and principles he had already described, whom\r\nhe could not eulogize if he would. Gen. Taylor had been constantly,\r\nperseveringly, quietly standing up, doing his duty and asking no praise\r\nor reward for it. He was and must be just the man to whom the interests,\r\nprinciples, and prosperity of the country might be safely intrusted.\r\nHe had never failed in anything he had undertaken, although many of his\r\nduties had been considered almost impossible.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln then went into a terse though rapid review of the origin\r\nof the Mexican War and the connection of the administration and General\r\nTaylor with it, from which he deduced a strong appeal to the Whigs present\r\nto do their duty in the support of General Taylor, and closed with the\r\nwarmest aspirations for and confidence in a deserved success.\r\n\r\nAt the close of his truly masterly and convincing speech, the audience\r\ngave three enthusiastic cheers for Illinois, and three more for the\r\neloquent Whig member from the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS FATHER'S REQUEST FOR MONEY\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS LINCOLN\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, Dec. 24, 1848.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FATHER:--Your letter of the 7th was received night before last.\r\nI very cheerfully send you the twenty dollars, which sum you say is\r\nnecessary to save your land from sale. It is singular that you should\r\nhave forgotten a judgment against you; and it is more singular that the\r\nplaintiff should have let you forget it so long; particularly as I suppose\r\nyou always had property enough to satisfy a judgment of that amount.\r\nBefore you pay it, it would be well to be sure you have not paid, or at\r\nleast, that you cannot prove you have paid it.\r\n\r\nGive my love to mother and all the connections. Affectionately your son,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1849\r\n\r\nBILL TO ABOLISH SLAVERY IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\r\n\r\nResolved, That the Committee on the District of Columbia be instructed to\r\nreport a bill in substance as follows:\r\n\r\nSec. 1.

If he\r\nunderstood those objections, the first was that if the bill were to become\r\na law, it would be used to lock large portions of the public lands from\r\nsale, without at last effecting the ostensible object of the bill--the\r\nconstruction of railroads in the new States; and secondly, that Congress\r\nwould be forced to the abandonment of large portions of the public lands\r\nto the States for which they might be reserved, without their paying for\r\nthem. This he understood to be the substance of the objections of the\r\ngentleman from Ohio to the passage of the bill.\r\n\r\nIf he could get the attention of the House for a few minutes, he would ask\r\ngentlemen to tell us what motive could induce any State Legislature, or\r\nindividual, or company of individuals, of the new States, to expend money\r\nin surveying roads which they might know they could not make.\r\n\r\n(A voice: They are not required to make the road.)\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln continued: That was not the case he was making. What motive\r\nwould tempt any set of men to go into an extensive survey of a railroad\r\nwhich they did not intend to make? What good would it do? Did men act\r\nwithout motive? Did business men commonly go into an expenditure of money\r\nwhich could be of no account to them? He generally found that men who have\r\nmoney were disposed to hold on to it, unless they could see something to\r\nbe made by its investment. He could not see what motive of advantage to\r\nthe new States could be subserved by merely keeping the public lands out\r\nof market, and preventing their settlement. As far as he could see, the\r\nnew States were wholly without any motive to do such a thing. This, then,\r\nhe took to be a good answer to the first objection.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the fact assumed, that after a while, the new States having\r\ngot hold of the public lands to a certain extent, they would turn round\r\nand compel Congress to relinquish all claim to them, he had a word to say,\r\nby way of recurring to the history of the past. When was the time to come\r\n(he asked) when the States in which the public lands were situated would\r\ncompose a majority of the representation in Congress, or anything like\r\nit? A majority of Representatives would very soon reside west of the\r\nmountains, he admitted; but would they all come from States in which\r\nthe public lands were situated? They certainly would not; for, as these\r\nWestern States grew strong in Congress, the public lands passed away from\r\nthem, and they got on the other side of the question; and the gentleman\r\nfrom Ohio [Mr. Vinton] was an example attesting that fact.\r\n\r\nMr. Vinton interrupted here to say that he had stood on this question just\r\nwhere he was now, for five and twenty years.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln was not making an argument for the purpose of convicting the\r\ngentleman of any impropriety at all. He was speaking of a fact in history,\r\nof which his State was an example. He was referring to a plain principle\r\nin the nature of things. The State of Ohio had now grown to be a giant.\r\nShe had a large delegation on that floor; but was she now in favor of\r\ngranting lands to the new States, as she used to be? The New England\r\nStates, New York, and the Old Thirteen were all rather quiet upon the\r\nsubject; and it was seen just now that a member from one of the new States\r\nwas the first man to rise up in opposition. And such would be with the\r\nhistory of this question for the future. There never would come a time\r\nwhen the people residing in the States embracing the public lands would\r\nhave the entire control of this subject; and so it was a matter of\r\ncertainty that Congress would never do more in this respect than what\r\nwould be dictated by a just liberality. The apprehension, therefore,\r\nthat the public lands were in danger of being wrested from the General\r\nGovernment by the strength of the delegation in Congress from the new\r\nStates, was utterly futile. There never could be such a thing. If we take\r\nthese lands (said he) it will not be without your consent. We can never\r\noutnumber you. The result is that all fear of the new States turning\r\nagainst the right of Congress to the public domain must be effectually\r\nquelled, as those who are opposed to that interest must always hold a vast\r\nmajority here, and they will never surrender the whole or any part of\r\nthe public lands unless they themselves choose to do so. That was all he\r\ndesired to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON FEDERAL POLITICAL APPOINTMENTS\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, March 9, 1849.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR: Colonel R. D. Baker and myself are the only Whig members of\r\nCongress from Illinois of the Thirtieth, and he of the Thirty-first. We\r\nhave reason to think the Whigs of that State hold us responsible, to some\r\nextent, for the appointments which may be made of our citizens. We do not\r\nknow you personally, and our efforts to you have so far been unavailing.\r\nI therefore hope I am not obtrusive in saying in this way, for him\r\nand myself, that when a citizen of Illinois is to be appointed in\r\nyour department, to an office either in or out of the State, we most\r\nrespectfully ask to be heard.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMORE POLITICAL PATRONAGE REQUESTS\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, March 10, 1849.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\nSIR:--There are several applicants for the office of United States\r\nMarshal for the District of Illinois. Among the most prominent of them are\r\nBenjamin Bond, Esq., of Carlyle, and Thomas, Esq., of Galena. Mr. Bond\r\nI know to be personally every way worthy of the office; and he is very\r\nnumerously and most respectably recommended. His papers I send to you; and\r\nI solicit for his claims a full and fair consideration.\r\n\r\nHaving said this much, I add that in my individual judgment the\r\nappointment of Mr. Thomas would be the better.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n(Indorsed on Mr. Bond's papers.)\r\n\r\nIn this and the accompanying envelope are the recommendations of about\r\ntwo hundred good citizens of all parts of Illinois, that Benjamin Bond be\r\nappointed marshal for that district. They include the names of nearly\r\nall our Whigs who now are, or have ever been, members of the State\r\nLegislature, besides forty-six of the Democratic members of the present\r\nLegislature, and many other good citizens. I add that from personal\r\nknowledge I consider Mr. Bond every way worthy of the office, and\r\nqualified to fill it. Holding the individual opinion that the appointment\r\nof a different gentleman would be better, I ask especial attention and\r\nconsideration for his claims, and for the opinions expressed in his favor\r\nby those over whom I can claim no superiority.\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, April 7, 1849\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF THE HOME DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--I recommend that Walter Davis be appointed receiver of the\r\nland-office at this place, whenever there shall be a vacancy. I cannot\r\nsay that Mr. Herndon, the present incumbent, has failed in the proper\r\ndischarge of any of the duties of the office. He is a very warm partisan,\r\nand openly and actively opposed to the election of General Taylor. I\r\nalso understand that since General Taylor's election he has received\r\na reappointment from Mr. Polk, his old commission not having expired.\r\nWhether this is true the records of the department will show. I may add\r\nthat the Whigs here almost universally desire his removal.\r\n\r\nI give no opinion of my own, but state the facts, and express the hope\r\nthat the department will act in this as in all other cases on some proper\r\ngeneral rule.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP. S.--The land district to which this office belongs is very nearly if\r\nnot entirely within my district; so that Colonel Baker, the other Whig\r\nrepresentative, claims no voice in the appointment. A. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, April 7, 1849.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF THE HOME DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--I recommend that Turner R. King, now of Pekin, Illinois, be\r\nappointed register of the land-office at this place whenever there shall\r\nbe a vacancy.\r\n\r\nI do not know that Mr. Barret, the present incumbent, has failed in the\r\nproper discharge of any of his duties in the office. He is a decided\r\npartisan, and openly and actively opposed the election of General Taylor.\r\nI understand, too, that since the election of General Taylor, Mr. Barret\r\nhas received a reappointment from Mr. Polk, his old commission not having\r\nexpired. Whether this be true, the records of the department will show.\r\n\r\nWhether he should be removed I give no opinion, but merely express the\r\nwish that the department may act upon some proper general rule, and that\r\nMr. Barret's case may not be made an exception to it.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP. S.-The land district to which this office belongs is very nearly if\r\nnot entirely within my district; so that Colonel Baker, the other Whig\r\nrepresentative, claims no voice in the appointment. A. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE POSTMASTER-GENERAL.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, April 7,1849.\r\n\r\nHON. POSTMASTER-GENERAL.\r\n\r\nDEAR Sir:--I recommend that Abner Y. Ellis be appointed postmaster at\r\nthis place, whenever there shall be a vacancy. J. R. Diller, the present\r\nincumbent, I cannot say has failed in the proper discharge of any of\r\nthe duties of the office. He, however, has been an active partisan in\r\nopposition to us.\r\n\r\nLocated at the seat of government of the State, he has been, for part\r\nif not the whole of the time he has held the office, a member of the\r\nDemocratic State Central Committee, signing his name to their addresses\r\nand manifestoes; and has been, as I understand, reappointed by Mr. Polk\r\nsince General Taylor's election. These are the facts of the case as I\r\nunderstand them, and I give no opinion of mine as to whether he should\r\nor should not be removed. My wish is that the department may adopt some\r\nproper general rule for such cases, and that Mr. Diller may not be made an\r\nexception to it, one way or the other.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP. S.--This office, with its delivery, is entirely within my district; so\r\nthat Colonel Baker, the other Whig representative, claims no voice in the\r\nappointment.L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, April 7, 1849.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF THE HOME DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--I recommend that William Butler be appointed pension agent\r\nfor the Illinois agency, when the place shall be vacant. Mr. Hurst, the\r\npresent incumbent, I believe has performed the duties very well. He is a\r\ndecided partisan, and I believe expects to be removed. Whether he shall, I\r\nsubmit to the department. This office is not confined to my district, but\r\npertains to the whole State; so that Colonel Baker has an equal right with\r\nmyself to be heard concerning it. However, the office is located here;\r\nand I think it is not probable that any one would desire to remove from a\r\ndistance to take it.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMPSON.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, April 25, 1849.\r\n\r\nDEAR THOMPSON: A tirade is still kept up against me here for recommending\r\nT. R. King. This morning it is openly avowed that my supposed influence at\r\nWashington shall be broken down generally, and King's prospects defeated\r\nin particular. Now, what I have done in this matter I have done at the\r\nrequest of you and some other friends in Tazewell; and I therefore ask you\r\nto either admit it is wrong or come forward and sustain me. If the truth\r\nwill permit, I propose that you sustain me in the following manner: copy\r\nthe inclosed scrap in your own handwriting and get everybody (not three or\r\nfour, but three or four hundred) to sign it, and then send it to me. Also,\r\nhave six, eight or ten of our best known Whig friends there write to me\r\nindividual letters, stating the truth in this matter as they understand\r\nit. Don't neglect or delay in the matter. I understand information of an\r\nindictment having been found against him about three years ago, for gaming\r\nor keeping a gaming house, has been sent to the department. I shall try\r\nto take care of it at the department till your action can be had and\r\nforwarded on.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD ILLINOIS. May 10, 1849.\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--I regret troubling you so often in relation to the land-offices\r\nhere, but I hope you will perceive the necessity of it, and excuse me. On\r\nthe 7th of April I wrote you recommending Turner R. King for register, and\r\nWalter Davis for receiver. Subsequently I wrote you that, for a private\r\nreason, I had concluded to transpose them. That private reason was the\r\nrequest of an old personal friend who himself desired to be receiver,\r\nbut whom I felt it my duty to refuse a recommendation. He said if I would\r\ntranspose King and Davis he would be satisfied. I thought it a whim, but,\r\nanxious to oblige him, I consented. Immediately he commenced an assault\r\nupon King's character, intending, as I suppose, to defeat his appointment,\r\nand thereby secure another chance for himself. This double offence of bad\r\nfaith to me and slander upon a good man is so totally outrageous that I\r\nnow ask to have King and Davis placed as I originally recommended,--that\r\nis, King for register and Davis for receiver.\r\n\r\nAn effort is being made now to have Mr. Barret, the present register,\r\nretained. I have already said he has done the duties of the office well,\r\nand I now add he is a gentleman in the true sense. Still, he submits to be\r\nthe instrument of his party to injure us. His high character enables him\r\nto do it more effectually. Last year he presided at the convention which\r\nnominated the Democratic candidate for Congress in this district, and\r\nafterward ran for the State Senate himself, not desiring the seat, but\r\navowedly to aid and strengthen his party. He made speech after speech with\r\na degree of fierceness and coarseness against General Taylor not quite\r\nconsistent with his habitually gentlemanly deportment. At least one (and\r\nI think more) of those who are now trying to have him retained was himself\r\nan applicant for this very office, and, failing to get my recommendation,\r\nnow takes this turn.\r\n\r\nIn writing you a third time in relation to these offices, I stated that I\r\nsupposed charges had been forwarded to you against King, and that I would\r\ninquire into the truth of them. I now send you herewith what I suppose\r\nwill be an ample defense against any such charges. I ask attention to all\r\nthe papers, but particularly to the letters of Mr. David Mack, and the\r\npaper with the long list of names. There is no mistake about King's being\r\na good man. After the unjust assault upon him, and considering the just\r\nclaims of Tazewell County, as indicated in the letters I inclose you, it\r\nwould in my opinion be injustice, and withal a blunder, not to appoint\r\nhim, at least as soon as any one is appointed to either of the offices\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. GILLESPIE.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., May 19, 1849.\r\n\r\nDEAR GILLESPIE:\r\n\r\nButterfield will be commissioner of the Gen'l Land Office, unless\r\nprevented by strong and speedy efforts. Ewing is for him, and he is only\r\nnot appointed yet because Old Zach. hangs fire.\r\n\r\nI have reliable information of this. Now, if you agree with me that this\r\nappointment would dissatisfy rather than gratify the Whigs of this\r\nState, that it would slacken their energies in future contests, that his\r\nappointment in '41 is an old sore with them which they will not patiently\r\nhave reopened,--in a word that his appointment now would be a fatal\r\nblunder to the administration and our political men here in Illinois,\r\nwrite Crittenden to that effect. He can control the matter. Were you to\r\nwrite Ewing I fear the President would never hear of your letter. This may\r\nbe mere suspicion. You might write directly to Old Zach. You will be the\r\nbest judge of the propriety of that. Not a moment's time is to be lost.\r\n\r\nLet this be confidential except with Mr. Edwards and a few others whom you\r\nknow I would trust just as I do you.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR GENERAL LAND-OFFICE APPPOINTMENT\r\n\r\nTO E. EMBREE.\r\n\r\n[Confidential]\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, May 25, 1849.\r\n\r\nHON. E. EMBREE\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--I am about to ask a favor of you, one which I hope will not\r\ncost you much. I understand the General Land-Office is about to be given\r\nto Illinois, and that Mr. Ewing desires Justin Butterfield, of Chicago, to\r\nbe the man. I give you my word, the appointment of Mr. Butterfield will\r\nbe an egregious political blunder. It will give offence to the whole Whig\r\nparty here, and be worse than a dead loss to the administration of so much\r\nof its patronage. Now, if you can conscientiously do so, I wish you to\r\nwrite General Taylor at once, saying that either I or the man I recommend\r\nshould in your opinion be appointed to that office, if any one from\r\nIllinois shall be. I restrict my request to Illinois because you may have\r\na man from your own State, and I do not ask to interfere with that.\r\n\r\nYour friend as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A PATENT\r\n\r\nIMPROVED METHOD OF LIFTING VESSELS OVER SHOALS.\r\n\r\nApplication for Patent:\r\n\r\nWhat I claim as my invention, and desire to secure by letters patent, is\r\nthe combination of expansible buoyant chambers placed at the sides of a\r\nvessel with the main shaft or shafts by means of the sliding spars, which\r\npass down through the buoyant chambers and are made fast to their bottoms\r\nand the series of ropes and pulleys or their equivalents in such a manner\r\nthat by turning the main shaft or shafts in one direction the buoyant\r\nchambers will be forced downward into the water, and at the same time\r\nexpanded and filled with air for buoying up the vessel by the displacement\r\nof water, and by turning the shafts in an opposite direction the buoyant\r\nchambers will be contracted into a small space and secured against injury.\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF INTERIOR.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., June 3, 1849\r\n\r\nHON. SECRETARY OF INTERIOR.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Vandalia, the receiver's office at which place is the subject\r\nof the within, is not in my district; and I have been much perplexed to\r\nexpress any preference between Dr. Stapp and Mr. Remann. If any one man\r\nis better qualified for such an office than all others, Dr. Stapp is that\r\nman; still, I believe a large majority of the Whigs of the district prefer\r\nMr. Remann, who also is a good man. Perhaps the papers on file will enable\r\nyou to judge better than I can. The writers of the within are good men,\r\nresiding within the land district.\r\n\r\nYour obt. servant,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO W. H. HERNDON.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, June 5, 1849.\r\n\r\nDEAR WILLIAM:--Your two letters were received last night. I have a great\r\nmany letters to write, and so cannot write very long ones. There must be\r\nsome mistake about Walter Davis saying I promised him the post-office.\r\nI did not so promise him. I did tell him that if the distribution of the\r\noffices should fall into my hands, he should have something; and if\r\nI shall be convinced he has said any more than this, I shall be\r\ndisappointed. I said this much to him because, as I understand, he is of\r\ngood character, is one of the young men, is of the mechanics, and always\r\nfaithful and never troublesome; a Whig, and is poor, with the support of a\r\nwidow mother thrown almost exclusively on him by the death of his brother.\r\nIf these are wrong reasons, then I have been wrong; but I have certainly\r\nnot been selfish in it, because in my greatest need of friends he was\r\nagainst me, and for Baker.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nP. S. Let the above be confidential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. GILLESPIE.\r\n\r\nDEAR GILLESPIE:\r\n\r\nMr. Edwards is unquestionably offended with me in connection with the\r\nmatter of the General Land-Office. He wrote a letter against me which was\r\nfiled at the department.\r\n\r\nThe better part of one's life consists of his friendships; and, of them,\r\nmine with Mr. Edwards was one of the most cherished. I have not been\r\nfalse to it. At a word I could have had the office any time before the\r\ndepartment was committed to Mr. Butterfield, at least Mr. Ewing and the\r\nPresident say as much. That word I forbore to speak, partly for other\r\nreasons, but chiefly for Mr. Edwards' sake, losing the office (that he\r\nmight gain it) I was always for; but to lose his friendship, by the effort\r\nfor him, would oppress me very much, were I not sustained by the utmost\r\nconsciousness of rectitude. I first determined to be an applicant,\r\nunconditionally, on the 2nd of June; and I did so then upon being informed\r\nby a telegraphic despatch that the question was narrowed down to Mr. B and\r\nmyself, and that the Cabinet had postponed the appointment three weeks,\r\nfor my benefit. Not doubting that Mr. Edwards was wholly out of the\r\nquestion I, nevertheless, would not then have become an applicant had I\r\nsupposed he would thereby be brought to suspect me of treachery to him.\r\nTwo or three days afterwards a conversation with Levi Davis convinced me\r\nMr. Edwards was dissatisfied; but I was then too far in to get out. His\r\nown letter, written on the 25th of April, after I had fully informed\r\nhim of all that had passed, up to within a few days of that time, gave\r\nassurance I had that entire confidence from him which I felt my uniform\r\nand strong friendship for him entitled me to. Among other things it says,\r\n\"Whatever course your judgment may dictate as proper to be pursued, shall\r\nnever be excepted to by me.\" I also had had a letter from Washington,\r\nsaying Chambers, of the Republic, had brought a rumor then, that Mr. E had\r\ndeclined in my favor, which rumor I judged came from Mr. E himself, as I\r\nhad not then breathed of his letter to any living creature. In saying\r\nI had never, before the 2nd of June, determined to be an applicant,\r\nunconditionally, I mean to admit that, before then, I had said\r\nsubstantially I would take the office rather than it should be lost to\r\nthe State, or given to one in the State whom the Whigs did not want; but\r\nI aver that in every instance in which I spoke of myself, I intended to\r\nkeep, and now believe I did keep, Mr. E above myself. Mr. Edwards' first\r\nsuspicion was that I had allowed Baker to overreach me, as his friend,\r\nin behalf of Don Morrison. I knew this was a mistake; and the result has\r\nproved it. I understand his view now is, that if I had gone to open war\r\nwith Baker I could have ridden him down, and had the thing all my own way.\r\nI believe no such thing. With Baker and some strong man from the Military\r\ntract & elsewhere for Morrison, and we and some strong man from the\r\nWabash & elsewhere for Mr. E, it was not possible for either to succeed.\r\nI believed this in March, and I know it now. The only thing which gave\r\neither any chance was the very thing Baker & I proposed,--an adjustment\r\nwith themselves.\r\n\r\nYou may wish to know how Butterfield finally beat me. I can not tell\r\nyou particulars now, but will when I see you. In the meantime let it be\r\nunderstood I am not greatly dissatisfied,--I wish the offer had been so\r\nbestowed as to encourage our friends in future contests, and I regret\r\nexceedingly Mr. Edwards' feelings towards me. These two things away, I\r\nshould have no regrets,--at least I think I would not.\r\n\r\nWrite me soon.\r\n\r\nYour friend, as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESOLUTIONS OF SYMPATHY WITH THE CAUSE OF HUNGARIAN FREEDOM,\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER [1??], 1849.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting to express sympathy with the cause of Hungarian freedom, Dr.\r\nTodd, Thos. Lewis, Hon. A. Lincoln, and Wm. Carpenter were appointed a\r\ncommittee to present appropriate resolutions, which reported through Hon.\r\nA. Lincoln the following:\r\n\r\nResolved, That, in their present glorious struggle for liberty, the\r\nHungarians command our highest admiration and have our warmest sympathy.\r\n\r\nResolved, That they have our most ardent prayers for their speedy triumph\r\nand final success.\r\n\r\nResolved, That the Government of the United States should acknowledge the\r\nindependence of Hungary as a nation of freemen at the very earliest moment\r\nconsistent with our amicable relations with the government against which\r\nthey are contending.\r\n\r\nResolved, That, in the opinion of this meeting, the immediate\r\nacknowledgment of the independence of Hungary by our government is due\r\nfrom American freemen to their struggling brethren, to the general cause\r\nof republican liberty, and not violative of the just rights of any nation\r\nor people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO Dr. WILLIAM FITHIAN.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Sept. 14, 1849.\r\n\r\nDr. WILLIAM FITHIAN, Danville, Ill.\r\n\r\nDEAR DOCTOR:--Your letter of the 9th was received a day or two ago. The\r\nnotes and mortgages you enclosed me were duly received. I also got the\r\noriginal Blanchard mortgage from Antrim Campbell, with whom Blanchard had\r\nleft it for you. I got a decree of foreclosure on the whole; but, owing to\r\nthere being no redemption on the sale to be under the Blanchard mortgage,\r\nthe court allowed Mobley till the first of March to pay the money, before\r\nadvertising for sale. Stuart was empowered by Mobley to appear for him,\r\nand I had to take such decree as he would consent to, or none at all. I\r\ncast the matter about in my mind and concluded that as I could not get\r\na decree we would put the accrued interest at interest, and thereby more\r\nthan match the fact of throwing the Blanchard debt back from twelve to six\r\nper cent., it was better to do it. This is the present state of the case.\r\n\r\nI can well enough understand and appreciate your suggestions about the\r\nLand-Office at Danville; but in my present condition, I can do nothing.\r\n\r\nYours, as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Dec. 15, 1849.\r\n\r\n------ ESQ.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--On my return from Kentucky I found your letter of the 7th of\r\nNovember, and have delayed answering it till now for the reason I now\r\nbriefly state. From the beginning of our acquaintance I had felt the\r\ngreatest kindness for you and had supposed it was reciprocated on your\r\npart. Last summer, under circumstances which I mentioned to you, I was\r\npainfully constrained to withhold a recommendation which you desired, and\r\nshortly afterwards I learned, in such a way as to believe it, that you\r\nwere indulging in open abuse of me. Of course my feelings were wounded.\r\nOn receiving your last letter the question occurred whether you were\r\nattempting to use me at the same time you would injure me, or whether you\r\nmight not have been misrepresented to me. If the former, I ought not to\r\nanswer you; if the latter, I ought, and so I have remained in suspense. I\r\nnow enclose you the letter, which you may use if you see fit.\r\n\r\nYours, etc.,\r\n\r\nA.

Monday, June 3, 1850.\r\n\r\nOn the opening of the Court this morning, the Hon. A. Lincoln, a member\r\nof the Bar of this Court, suggested the death of the Hon. Nathaniel\r\nPope, late a judge of this Court, since the adjournment of the last term;\r\nwhereupon, in token of respect for the memory of the deceased, it is\r\nordered that the Court do now adjourn until to-morrow morning at ten\r\no'clock.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Stephen T. Logan, the Hon. Norman H. Purple, the Hon. David L.\r\nGregg, the Hon. A. Lincoln, and George W. Meeker, Esq., were appointed a\r\nCommittee to prepare resolutions.\r\n\r\nWhereupon, the Hon. Stephen T. Logan, in behalf of the Committee,\r\npresented the following preamble and resolutions:\r\n\r\nWhereas The Hon. Nathaniel Pope, District Judge of the United States Court\r\nfor the District of Illinois, having departed this life during the\r\nlast vacation of said Court, and the members of the Bar of said Court,\r\nentertaining the highest veneration for his memory, a profound respect for\r\nhis ability, great experience, and learning as a judge, and cherishing for\r\nhis many virtues, public and private, his earnest simplicity of character\r\nand unostentatious deportment, both in his public and private relations,\r\nthe most lively and affectionate recollections, have\r\n\r\nResolved, That, as a manifestation of their deep sense of the loss\r\nwhich has been sustained in his death, they will wear the usual badge of\r\nmourning during the residue of the term.\r\n\r\nResolved, That the Chairman communicate to the family of the deceased a\r\ncopy of these proceedings, with an assurance of our sincere condolence on\r\naccount of their heavy bereavement.\r\n\r\nResolved, That the Hon. A. Williams, District Attorney of this Court, be\r\nrequested in behalf of the meeting to present these proceedings to the\r\nCircuit Court, and respectfully to ask that they may be entered on the\r\nrecords.\r\n\r\nE. N. POWELL, Sec'y. SAMUEL H. TREAT, Ch'n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES FOR LAW LECTURE\r\n\r\n(fragments)\r\n\r\nJULY 1, 1850\r\n\r\nDISCOURAGE LITIGATION. Persuade your neighbors to compromise whenever you\r\ncan. Point out to them how the nominal winner is often a real loser--in\r\nfees, expenses, and waste of time. As a peace-maker the lawyer has a\r\nsuperior opportunity of being a good man. There will still be business\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nNever stir up litigation. A worse man can scarcely be found than one\r\nwho does this. Who can be more nearly a fiend than he who habitually\r\nover-hauls the register of deeds in search of defects in titles, whereon\r\nto stir up strife, and put money in his pocket? A moral tone ought to be\r\ninfused into the profession which should drive such men out of it.\r\n\r\nThe matter of fees is important, far beyond the mere question of bread\r\nand butter involved. Properly attended to, fuller justice is done to both\r\nlawyer and client. An exorbitant fee should never be claimed. As a general\r\nrule never take your whole fee in advance, nor any more than a small\r\nretainer. When fully paid beforehand, you are more than a common mortal\r\nif you can feel the same interest in the case as if something was still in\r\nprospect for you, as well as for your client. And when you lack interest\r\nin the case the job will very likely lack skill and diligence in the\r\nperformance. Settle the amount of fee and take a note in advance. Then you\r\nwill feel that you are working for something, and you are sure to do your\r\nwork faithfully and well. Never sell a fee note--at least not before\r\nthe consideration service is performed. It leads to negligence and\r\ndishonesty--negligence by losing interest in the case, and dishonesty in\r\nrefusing to refund when you have allowed the consideration to fail.\r\n\r\nThis idea of a refund or reduction of charges from the lawyer in a failed\r\ncase is a new one to me--but not a bad one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1851\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTERS TO FAMILY MEMBERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN D. JOHNSTON.\r\n\r\nJanuary 2, 1851\r\n\r\nDEAR JOHNSTON:--Your request for eighty dollars I do not think it best to\r\ncomply with now. At the various times when I have helped you a little you\r\nhave said to me, \"We can get along very well now\"; but in a very short\r\ntime I find you in the same difficulty again. Now, this can only happen by\r\nsome defect in your conduct. What that defect is, I think I know. You are\r\nnot lazy, and still you are an idler. I doubt whether, since I saw you,\r\nyou have done a good whole day's work in any one day. You do not very much\r\ndislike to work, and still you do not work much merely because it does\r\nnot seem to you that you could get much for it. This habit of uselessly\r\nwasting time is the whole difficulty; it is vastly important to you, and\r\nstill more so to your children, that you should break the habit. It is\r\nmore important to them, because they have longer to live, and can keep out\r\nof an idle habit before they are in it, easier than they can get out after\r\nthey are in.\r\n\r\nYou are now in need of some money; and what I propose is, that you shall\r\ngo to work, \"tooth and nail,\" for somebody who will give you money for it.\r\nLet father and your boys take charge of your things at home, prepare for\r\na crop, and make the crop, and you go to work for the best money wages, or\r\nin discharge of any debt you owe, that you can get; and, to secure you a\r\nfair reward for your labor, I now promise you, that for every dollar you\r\nwill, between this and the first of May, get for your own labor, either in\r\nmoney or as your own indebtedness, I will then give you one other dollar.\r\nBy this, if you hire yourself at ten dollars a month, from me you will get\r\nten more, making twenty dollars a month for your work. In this I do not\r\nmean you shall go off to St. Louis, or the lead mines, or the gold mines\r\nin California, but I mean for you to go at it for the best wages you can\r\nget close to home in Coles County. Now, if you will do this, you will be\r\nsoon out of debt, and, what is better, you will have a habit that will\r\nkeep you from getting in debt again. But, if I should now clear you out\r\nof debt, next year you would be just as deep in as ever. You say you would\r\nalmost give your place in heaven for seventy or eighty dollars. Then you\r\nvalue your place in heaven very cheap, for I am sure you can, with the\r\noffer I make, get the seventy or eighty dollars for four or five months'\r\nwork. You say if I will furnish you the money you will deed me the\r\nland, and, if you don't pay the money back, you will deliver possession.\r\nNonsense! If you can't now live with the land, how will you then live\r\nwithout it? You have always been kind to me, and I do not mean to be\r\nunkind to you. On the contrary, if you will but follow my advice, you will\r\nfind it worth more than eighty times eighty dollars to you.\r\n\r\nAffectionately your brother,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO C. HOYT.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Jan. 11, 1851.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. HOYT, ESQ.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Our case is decided against us. The decision was announced\r\nthis morning. Very sorry, but there is no help. The history of the case\r\nsince it came here is this. On Friday morning last, Mr. Joy filed his\r\npapers, and entered his motion for a mandamus, and urged me to take up the\r\nmotion as soon as possible. I already had the points and authority sent me\r\nby you and by Mr. Goodrich, but had not studied them. I began preparing as\r\nfast as possible.\r\n\r\nThe evening of the same day I was again urged to take up the case. I\r\nrefused on the ground that I was not ready, and on which plea I also\r\ngot off over Saturday. But on Monday (the 14th) I had to go into it. We\r\noccupied the whole day, I using the large part. I made every point and\r\nused every authority sent me by yourself and by Mr. Goodrich; and in\r\naddition all the points I could think of and all the authorities I could\r\nfind myself. When I closed the argument on my part, a large package was\r\nhanded me, which proved to be the plat you sent me.\r\n\r\nThe court received it of me, but it was not different from the plat\r\nalready on the record. I do not think I could ever have argued the case\r\nbetter than I did. I did nothing else, but prepare to argue and argue this\r\ncase, from Friday morning till Monday evening. Very sorry for the result;\r\nbut I do not think it could have been prevented.\r\n\r\nYour friend, as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN D. JOHNSTON.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, January 12, 1851\r\n\r\nDEAR BROTHER:--On the day before yesterday I received a letter from\r\nHarriet, written at Greenup. She says she has just returned from your\r\nhouse, and that father is very low and will hardly recover. She also says\r\nyou have written me two letters, and that, although you do not expect me\r\nto come now, you wonder that I do not write.\r\n\r\nI received both your letters, and although I have not answered them it is\r\nnot because I have forgotten them, or been uninterested about them, but\r\nbecause it appeared to me that I could write nothing which would do any\r\ngood. You already know I desire that neither father nor mother shall be in\r\nwant of any comfort, either in health or sickness, while they live; and I\r\nfeel sure you have not failed to use my name, if necessary, to procure a\r\ndoctor, or anything else for father in his present sickness. My business\r\nis such that I could hardly leave home now, if it was not as it is, that\r\nmy own wife is sick abed. (It is a case of baby-sickness, and I suppose is\r\nnot dangerous.) I sincerely hope father may recover his health, but at\r\nall events, tell him to remember to call upon and confide in our great and\r\ngood and merciful Maker, who will not turn away from him in any extremity.\r\nHe notes the fall of a sparrow, and numbers the hairs of our heads, and He\r\nwill not forget the dying man who puts his trust in Him. Say to him that\r\nif we could meet now it is doubtful whether it would not be more painful\r\nthan pleasant, but that if it be his lot to go now, he will soon have a\r\njoyous meeting with many loved ones gone before, and where the rest of us,\r\nthrough the help of God, hope ere long to join them.\r\n\r\nWrite to me again when you receive this.\r\n\r\nAffectionately,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPETITION ON BEHALF OF ONE JOSHUA GIPSON\r\n\r\nTO THE JUDGE OF THE SANGAMON COUNTY COURT,\r\n\r\nMAY 13, 1851.\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE, THE JUDGE OF THE COUNTY COURT\r\n\r\nIN AND FOR THE COUNTY OF SANGAMON AND STATE OF ILLINOIS:\r\n\r\nYour Petitioner, Joshua Gipson, respectfully represents that on or about\r\nthe 21st day of December, 1850, a judgment was rendered against your\r\nPetitioner for costs, by J. C. Spugg, one of the Justices of the Peace\r\nin and for said County of Sangamon, in a suit wherein your Petitioner\r\nwas plaintiff and James L. and C. B. Gerard were defendants; that said\r\njudgment was not the result of negligence on the part of your Petitioner;\r\nthat said judgment, in his opinion, is unjust and erroneous in this, that\r\nthe defendants were at that time and are indebted to this Petitioner in\r\nthe full amount of the principal and interest of the note sued on, the\r\nprincipal being, as affiant remembers and believes, thirty-one dollars\r\nand eighty two cents; and that, as affiant is informed and believes, the\r\ndefendants succeeded in the trial of said cause by proving old claims\r\nagainst your petitioner, in set-off against said note, which claims\r\nhad been settled, adjusted and paid before said note was executed. Your\r\nPetitioner further states that the reasons of his not being present at\r\nsaid trial, as he was not, and of its not being in his power to take an\r\nappeal in the ordinary way, as it was not, were that your Petitioner then\r\nresided in Edgar County about one hundred and twenty miles from where\r\ndefendants resided; that a very short time before the suit was commenced\r\nyour Petitioner was in Sangamon County for the purpose of collecting debts\r\ndue him, and with the rest, the note in question, which note had then been\r\ngiven more than a year, that your Petitioner then saw the defendant J.\r\nL. Gerard who is the principal in said note, and solicited payment of the\r\nsame; that said defendant then made no pretense that he did not owe the\r\nsame, but on the contrary expressly promised that he would come into\r\nSpringfield, in a very few days and either pay the money, or give a new\r\nnote, payable by the then next Christmas; that your Petitioner accordingly\r\nleft said note with said J. C. Spugg, with directions to give defendant\r\nfull time to pay the money or give the new note as above, and if he did\r\nneither to sue; and then affiant came home to Edgar County, not having the\r\nslightest suspicion that if suit should be brought, the defendants would\r\nmake any defense whatever; and your Petitioner never did in any way learn\r\nthat said suit had been commenced until more than twenty days after it had\r\nbeen decided against him. He therefore prays for a writ of Certiorari.\r\n\r\n   HIS\r\n JOSHUA x GIPSON\r\n   MARK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. D. JOHNSTON.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Aug. 31, 1851\r\n\r\nDEAR BROTHER: Inclosed is the deed for the land. We are all well, and\r\nhave nothing in the way of news. We have had no Cholera here for about two\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\nGive my love to all, and especially to Mother.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. D. JOHNSTON.\r\n\r\nSHELBYVILLE, Nov. 4, 1851\r\n\r\nDEAR BROTHER:\r\n\r\nWhen I came into Charleston day before yesterday I learned that you are\r\nanxious to sell the land where you live, and move to Missouri. I have been\r\nthinking of this ever since, and cannot but think such a notion is utterly\r\nfoolish. What can you do in Missouri better than here? Is the land richer?\r\nCan you there, any more than here, raise corn and wheat and oats without\r\nwork? Will anybody there, any more than here, do your work for you? If you\r\nintend to go to work, there is no better place than right where you\r\nare; if you do not intend to go to work you cannot get along anywhere.\r\nSquirming and crawling about from place to place can do no good. You have\r\nraised no crop this year, and what you really want is to sell the land,\r\nget the money and spend it. Part with the land you have, and, my life upon\r\nit, you will never after own a spot big enough to bury you in. Half you\r\nwill get for the land you spend in moving to Missouri, and the other half\r\nyou will eat and drink and wear out, and no foot of land will be bought.\r\nNow I feel it is my duty to have no hand in such a piece of foolery. I\r\nfeel that it is so even on your own account, and particularly on Mother's\r\naccount. The eastern forty acres I intend to keep for Mother while she\r\nlives; if you will not cultivate it, it will rent for enough to support\r\nher; at least it will rent for something. Her dower in the other two\r\nforties she can let you have, and no thanks to me.\r\n\r\nNow do not misunderstand this letter. I do not write it in any unkindness.\r\nI write it in order, if possible, to get you to face the truth, which\r\ntruth is, you are destitute because you have idled away all your time.\r\nYour thousand pretenses for not getting along better are all nonsense;\r\nthey deceive nobody but yourself. Go to work is the only cure for your\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nA word for Mother: Chapman tells me he wants you to go and live with him.\r\nIf I were you I would try it awhile. If you get tired of it (as I think\r\nyou will not) you can return to your own home. Chapman feels very kindly\r\nto you; and I have no doubt he will make your situation very pleasant.\r\n\r\nSincerely yours,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNov. 4, 1851\r\n\r\nDEAR MOTHER:\r\n\r\nChapman tells me he wants you to go and live with him. If I were you I\r\nwould try it awhile. If you get tired of it (as I think you will not) you\r\ncan return to your own home. Chapman feels very kindly to you; and I have\r\nno doubt he will make your situation very pleasant.\r\n\r\nSincerely your son,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN D. JOHNSTON.\r\n\r\nSHELBYVILLE, November 9, 1851\r\n\r\nDEAR BROTHER:--When I wrote you before, I had not received your letter.\r\nI still think as I did, but if the land can be sold so that I get three\r\nhundred dollars to put to interest for Mother, I will not object, if she\r\ndoes not. But before I will make a deed, the money must be had, or secured\r\nbeyond all doubt, at ten per cent.\r\n\r\nAs to Abram, I do not want him, on my own account; but I understand he\r\nwants to live with me, so that he can go to school and get a fair start in\r\nthe world, which I very much wish him to have. When I reach home, if I can\r\nmake it convenient to take, I will take him, provided there is no mistake\r\nbetween us as to the object and terms of my taking him. In haste, as ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN D. JOHNSTON.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, November 25, 1851.\r\n\r\nDEAR BROTHER:--Your letter of the 22d is just received. Your proposal\r\nabout selling the east forty acres of land is all that I want or could\r\nclaim for myself; but I am not satisfied with it on Mother's account--I\r\nwant her to have her living, and I feel that it is my duty, to some\r\nextent, to see that she is not wronged. She had a right of dower (that is,\r\nthe use of one-third for life) in the other two forties; but, it seems,\r\nshe has already let you take that, hook and line. She now has the use of\r\nthe whole of the east forty, as long as she lives; and if it be sold, of\r\ncourse she is entitled to the interest on all the money it brings, as long\r\nas she lives; but you propose to sell it for three hundred dollars, take\r\none hundred away with you, and leave her two hundred at 8 per cent.,\r\nmaking her the enormous sum of 16 dollars a year. Now, if you are\r\nsatisfied with treating her in that way, I am not. It is true that you are\r\nto have that forty for two hundred dollars, at Mother's death, but you are\r\nnot to have it before. I am confident that land can be made to produce for\r\nMother at least $30 a year, and I can not, to oblige any living person,\r\nconsent that she shall be put on an allowance of sixteen dollars a year.\r\n\r\nYours, etc.,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1852\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEULOGY ON HENRY CLAY,\r\n\r\nDELIVERED IN THE STATE HOUSE AT SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, JULY 16, 1852.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day of July, 1776, the people of a few feeble and oppressed\r\ncolonies of Great Britain, inhabiting a portion of the Atlantic coast of\r\nNorth America, publicly declared their national independence, and made\r\ntheir appeal to the justice of their cause and to the God of battles for\r\nthe maintenance of that declaration. That people were few in number and\r\nwithout resources, save only their wise heads and stout hearts. Within the\r\nfirst year of that declared independence, and while its maintenance was\r\nyet problematical, while the bloody struggle between those resolute rebels\r\nand their haughty would-be masters was still waging,--of undistinguished\r\nparents and in an obscure district of one of those colonies Henry Clay\r\nwas born. The infant nation and the infant child began the race of life\r\ntogether. For three quarters of a century they have travelled hand in\r\nhand. They have been companions ever. The nation has passed its perils,\r\nand it is free, prosperous, and powerful. The child has reached his\r\nmanhood, his middle age, his old age, and is dead. In all that has\r\nconcerned the nation the man ever sympathized; and now the nation mourns\r\nthe man.\r\n\r\nThe day after his death one of the public journals, opposed to him\r\npolitically, held the following pathetic and beautiful language, which I\r\nadopt partly because such high and exclusive eulogy, originating with a\r\npolitical friend, might offend good taste, but chiefly because I could not\r\nin any language of my own so well express my thoughts:\r\n\r\n\"Alas, who can realize that Henry Clay is dead! Who can realize that never\r\nagain that majestic form shall rise in the council-chambers of his country\r\nto beat back the storms of anarchy which may threaten, or pour the oil of\r\npeace upon the troubled billows as they rage and menace around! Who\r\ncan realize that the workings of that mighty mind have ceased, that the\r\nthrobbings of that gallant heart are stilled, that the mighty sweep of\r\nthat graceful arm will be felt no more, and the magic of that eloquent\r\ntongue, which spake as spake no other tongue besides, is hushed hushed for\r\never! Who can realize that freedom's champion, the champion of a civilized\r\nworld and of all tongues and kindreds of people, has indeed fallen! Alas,\r\nin those dark hours of peril and dread which our land has experienced, and\r\nwhich she may be called to experience again, to whom now may her people\r\nlook up for that counsel and advice which only wisdom and experience and\r\npatriotism can give, and which only the undoubting confidence of a nation\r\nwill receive? Perchance in the whole circle of the great and gifted of\r\nour land there remains but one on whose shoulders the mighty mantle of\r\nthe departed statesman may fall; one who while we now write is doubtless\r\npouring his tears over the bier of his brother and friend brother, friend,\r\never, yet in political sentiment as far apart as party could make them.\r\nAh, it is at times like these that the petty distinctions of mere party\r\ndisappear. We see only the great, the grand, the noble features of the\r\ndeparted statesman; and we do not even beg permission to bow at his\r\nfeet and mingle our tears with those who have ever been his political\r\nadherents--we do [not] beg this permission, we claim it as a right, though\r\nwe feel it as a privilege. Henry Clay belonged to his country--to the\r\nworld; mere party cannot claim men like him. His career has been national,\r\nhis fame has filled the earth, his memory will endure to the last syllable\r\nof recorded time.\r\n\r\n\"Henry Clay is dead! He breathed his last on yesterday, at twenty minutes\r\nafter eleven, in his chamber at Washington. To those who followed his lead\r\nin public affairs, it more appropriately belongs to pronounce his eulogy\r\nand pay specific honors to the memory of the illustrious dead. But all\r\nAmericans may show the grief which his death inspires, for his character\r\nand fame are national property. As on a question of liberty he knew no\r\nNorth, no South, no East, no West, but only the Union which held them all\r\nin its sacred circle, so now his countrymen will know no grief that is not\r\nas wide-spread as the bounds of the confederacy. The career of Henry Clay\r\nwas a public career. From his youth he has been devoted to the public\r\nservice, at a period, too, in the world's history justly regarded as a\r\nremarkable era in human affairs. He witnessed in the beginning the throes\r\nof the French Revolution. He saw the rise and fall of Napoleon. He was\r\ncalled upon to legislate for America and direct her policy when all Europe\r\nwas the battlefield of contending dynasties, and when the struggle for\r\nsupremacy imperilled the rights of all neutral nations. His voice spoke\r\nwar and peace in the contest with Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\"When Greece rose against the Turks and struck for liberty, his name was\r\nmingled with the battle-cry of freedom. When South America threw off the\r\nthraldom of Spain, his speeches were read at the head of her armies by\r\nBolivar. His name has been, and will continue to be, hallowed in two\r\nhemispheres, for it is\r\n\r\n     \"'One of the few, the immortal names\r\n      That were not born to die!'\r\n\r\n\"To the ardent patriot and profound statesman he added a quality possessed\r\nby few of the gifted on earth. His eloquence has not been surpassed. In\r\nthe effective power to move the heart of man, Clay was without an equal,\r\nand the heaven-born endowment, in the spirit of its origin, has been\r\nmost conspicuously exhibited against intestine feud. On at least three\r\nimportant occasions he has quelled our civil commotions by a power and\r\ninfluence which belonged to no other statesman of his age and times. And\r\nin our last internal discord, when this Union trembled to its centre, in\r\nold age he left the shades of private life, and gave the death-blow to\r\nfraternal strife, with the vigor of his earlier years, in a series\r\nof senatorial efforts which in themselves would bring immortality by\r\nchallenging comparison with the efforts of any statesman in any age. He\r\nexorcised the demon which possessed the body politic, and gave peace to a\r\ndistracted land. Alas! the achievement cost him his life. He sank day by\r\nday to the tomb his pale but noble brow bound with a triple wreath, put\r\nthere by a grateful country. May his ashes rest in peace, while his spirit\r\ngoes to take its station among the great and good men who preceded him.\"\r\n\r\nWhile it is customary and proper upon occasions like the present to give\r\na brief sketch of the life of the deceased, in the case of Mr. Clay it is\r\nless necessary than most others; for his biography has been written and\r\nrewritten and read and reread for the last twenty-five years; so that,\r\nwith the exception of a few of the latest incidents of his life, all is\r\nas well known as it can be. The short sketch which I give is, therefore,\r\nmerely to maintain the connection of this discourse.\r\n\r\nHenry Clay was born on the twelfth day of April, 1777, in Hanover County,\r\nVirginia. Of his father, who died in the fourth or fifth year of Henry's\r\nage, little seems to be known, except that he was a respectable man and\r\na preacher of the Baptist persuasion. Mr. Clay's education to the end of\r\nlife was comparatively limited. I say \"to the end of life,\" because I\r\nhave understood that from time to time he added something to his education\r\nduring the greater part of his whole life. Mr. Clay's lack of a more\r\nperfect early education, however it may be regretted generally, teaches\r\nat least one profitable lesson: it teaches that in this country one\r\ncan scarcely be so poor but that, if he will, he can acquire sufficient\r\neducation to get through the world respectably. In his twenty-third\r\nyear Mr. Clay was licensed to practise law, and emigrated to Lexington,\r\nKentucky. Here he commenced and continued the practice till the year\r\n1803, when he was first elected to the Kentucky Legislature. By successive\r\nelections he was continued in the Legislature till the latter part of\r\n1806, when he was elected to fill a vacancy of a single session in the\r\nUnited States Senate. In 1807 he was again elected to the Kentucky House\r\nof Representatives, and by that body chosen Speaker. In 1808 he was\r\nre-elected to the same body. In 1809 he was again chosen to fill a vacancy\r\nof two years in the United States Senate. In 1811 he was elected to the\r\nUnited States House of Representatives, and on the first day of taking his\r\nseat in that body he was chosen its Speaker. In 1813 he was again elected\r\nSpeaker. Early in 1814, being the period of our last British war, Mr. Clay\r\nwas sent as commissioner, with others, to negotiate a treaty of peace,\r\nwhich treaty was concluded in the latter part of the same year. On his\r\nreturn from Europe he was again elected to the lower branch of Congress,\r\nand on taking his seat in December, 1815, was called to his old post-the\r\nSpeaker's chair, a position in which he was retained by successive\r\nelections, with one brief intermission, till the inauguration of John\r\nQuincy Adams, in March, 1825. He was then appointed Secretary of State,\r\nand occupied that important station till the inauguration of General\r\nJackson, in March, 1829. After this he returned to Kentucky, resumed the\r\npractice of law, and continued it till the autumn of 1831, when he was by\r\nthe Legislature of Kentucky again placed in the United States Senate. By\r\na reelection he was continued in the Senate till he resigned his seat and\r\nretired, in March, 1848. In December, 1849, he again took his seat in the\r\nSenate, which he again resigned only a few months before his death.\r\n\r\nBy the foregoing it is perceived that the period from the beginning of Mr.\r\nClay's official life in 1803 to the end of 1852 is but one year short\r\nof half a century, and that the sum of all the intervals in it will not\r\namount to ten years. But mere duration of time in office constitutes the\r\nsmallest part of Mr. Clay's history. Throughout that long period he has\r\nconstantly been the most loved and most implicitly followed by friends,\r\nand the most dreaded by opponents, of all living American politicians. In\r\nall the great questions which have agitated the country, and particularly\r\nin those fearful crises, the Missouri question, the nullification\r\nquestion, and the late slavery question, as connected with the newly\r\nacquired territory, involving and endangering the stability of the Union,\r\nhis has been the leading and most conspicuous part. In 1824 he was first\r\na candidate for the Presidency, and was defeated; and, although he was\r\nsuccessively defeated for the same office in 1832 and in 1844, there has\r\nnever been a moment since 1824 till after 1848 when a very large portion\r\nof the American people did not cling to him with an enthusiastic hope and\r\npurpose of still elevating him to the Presidency. With other men, to\r\nbe defeated was to be forgotten; but with him defeat was but a trifling\r\nincident, neither changing him nor the world's estimate of him. Even those\r\nof both political parties who have been preferred to him for the highest\r\noffice have run far briefer courses than he, and left him still shining\r\nhigh in the heavens of the political world. Jackson, Van Buren, Harnson,\r\nPolk, and Taylor all rose after, and set long before him. The spell--the\r\nlong-enduring spell--with which the souls of men were bound to him is a\r\nmiracle. Who can compass it? It is probably true he owed his pre-eminence\r\nto no one quality, but to a fortunate combination of several. He was\r\nsurpassingly eloquent; but many eloquent men fail utterly, and they are\r\nnot, as a class, generally successful. His judgment was excellent;\r\nbut many men of good judgment live and die unnoticed. His will was\r\nindomitable; but this quality often secures to its owner nothing better\r\nthan a character for useless obstinacy. These, then, were Mr. Clay's\r\nleading qualities. No one of them is very uncommon; but all together are\r\nrarely combined in a single individual, and this is probably the reason\r\nwhy such men as Henry Clay are so rare in the world.\r\n\r\nMr. Clay's eloquence did not consist, as many fine specimens of eloquence\r\ndo, of types and figures, of antithesis and elegant arrangement of words\r\nand sentences, but rather of that deeply earnest and impassioned tone\r\nand manner which can proceed only from great sincerity, and a thorough\r\nconviction in the speaker of the justice and importance of his cause. This\r\nit is that truly touches the chords of sympathy; and those who heard\r\nMr. Clay never failed to be moved by it, or ever afterward forgot the\r\nimpression. All his efforts were made for practical effect. He never spoke\r\nmerely to be heard. He never delivered a Fourth of July oration, or a\r\neulogy on an occasion like this. As a politician or statesman, no one was\r\nso habitually careful to avoid all sectional ground. Whatever he did he\r\ndid for the whole country. In the construction of his measures, he\r\never carefully surveyed every part of the field, and duly weighed every\r\nconflicting interest. Feeling as he did, and as the truth surely is, that\r\nthe world's best hope depended on the continued union of these States,\r\nhe was ever jealous of and watchful for whatever might have the slightest\r\ntendency to separate them.\r\n\r\nMr. Clay's predominant sentiment, from first to last, was a deep devotion\r\nto the cause of human liberty--a strong sympathy with the oppressed\r\neverywhere, and an ardent wish for their elevation. With him this was a\r\nprimary and all-controlling passion. Subsidiary to this was the conduct\r\nof his whole life. He loved his country partly because it was his own\r\ncountry, and mostly because it was a free country; and he burned with a\r\nzeal for its advancement, prosperity, and glory, because he saw in such\r\nthe advancement, prosperity, and glory of human liberty, human right, and\r\nhuman nature. He desired the prosperity of his countrymen, partly because\r\nthey were his countrymen, but chiefly to show to the world that free men\r\ncould be prosperous.\r\n\r\nThat his views and measures were always the wisest needs not to be\r\naffirmed; nor should it be on this occasion, where so many thinking\r\ndifferently join in doing honor to his memory. A free people in times of\r\npeace and quiet when pressed by no common danger-naturally divide into\r\nparties. At such times the man who is of neither party is not, cannot be,\r\nof any consequence. Mr. Clay therefore was of a party. Taking a prominent\r\npart, as he did, in all the great political questions of his country for\r\nthe last half century, the wisdom of his course on many is doubted and\r\ndenied by a large portion of his countrymen; and of such it is not now\r\nproper to speak particularly. But there are many others, about his course\r\nupon which there is little or no disagreement amongst intelligent and\r\npatriotic Americans. Of these last are the War of 1812, the Missouri\r\nquestion, nullification, and the now recent compromise measures. In 1812\r\nMr. Clay, though not unknown, was still a young man. Whether we should\r\ngo to war with Great Britain being the question of the day, a minority\r\nopposed the declaration of war by Congress, while the majority, though\r\napparently inclined to war, had for years wavered, and hesitated to act\r\ndecisively. Meanwhile British aggressions multiplied, and grew more daring\r\nand aggravated. By Mr. Clay more than any other man the struggle was\r\nbrought to a decision in Congress. The question, being now fully before\r\nCongress, came up in a variety of ways in rapid succession, on most of\r\nwhich occasions Mr. Clay spoke. Adding to all the logic of which the\r\nsubject was susceptible that noble inspiration which came to him as it\r\ncame to no other, he aroused and nerved and inspired his friends, and\r\nconfounded and bore down all opposition. Several of his speeches on these\r\noccasions were reported and are still extant, but the best of them all\r\nnever was. During its delivery the reporters forgot their vocation,\r\ndropped their pens, and sat enchanted from near the beginning to quite the\r\nclose. The speech now lives only in the memory of a few old men, and the\r\nenthusiasm with which they cherish their recollection of it is absolutely\r\nastonishing. The precise language of this speech we shall never know; but\r\nwe do know we cannot help knowing--that with deep pathos it pleaded the\r\ncause of the injured sailor, that it invoked the genius of the Revolution,\r\nthat it apostrophized the names of Otis, of Henry, and of Washington, that\r\nit appealed to the interests, the pride, the honor, and the glory of\r\nthe nation, that it shamed and taunted the timidity of friends, that it\r\nscorned and scouted and withered the temerity of domestic foes, that\r\nit bearded and defied the British lion, and, rising and swelling and\r\nmaddening in its course, it sounded the onset, till the charge, the shock,\r\nthe steady struggle, and the glorious victory all passed in vivid review\r\nbefore the entranced hearers.\r\n\r\nImportant and exciting as was the war question of 1812, it never so\r\nalarmed the sagacious statesmen of the country for the safety of the\r\nRepublic as afterward did the Missouri question. This sprang from\r\nthat unfortunate source of discord--negro slavery. When our Federal\r\nConstitution was adopted, we owned no territory beyond the limits or\r\nownership of the States, except the territory northwest of the River Ohio\r\nand east of the Mississippi. What has since been formed into the States\r\nof Maine, Kentucky and Tennessee, was, I believe, within the limits of\r\nor owned by Massachusetts, Virginia, and North Carolina. As to the\r\nNorthwestern Territory, provision had been made even before the adoption\r\nof the Constitution that slavery should never go there. On the admission\r\nof States into the Union, carved from the territory we owned before the\r\nConstitution, no question, or at most no considerable question, arose\r\nabout slavery--those which were within the limits of or owned by the old\r\nStates following respectively the condition of the parent State, and those\r\nwithin the Northwest Territory following the previously made provision.\r\nBut in 1803 we purchased Louisiana of the French, and it included with\r\nmuch more what has since been formed into the State of Missouri. With\r\nregard to it, nothing had been done to forestall the question of slavery.\r\nWhen, therefore, in 1819, Missouri, having formed a State constitution\r\nwithout excluding slavery, and with slavery already actually existing\r\nwithin its limits, knocked at the door of the Union for admission, almost\r\nthe entire representation of the non-slaveholding States objected. A\r\nfearful and angry struggle instantly followed. This alarmed thinking\r\nmen more than any previous question, because, unlike all the former,\r\nit divided the country by geographical lines. Other questions had their\r\nopposing partisans in all localities of the country and in almost every\r\nfamily, so that no division of the Union could follow such without a\r\nseparation of friends to quite as great an extent as that of opponents.\r\nNot so with the Missouri question. On this a geographical line could be\r\ntraced, which in the main would separate opponents only. This was the\r\ndanger. Mr. Jefferson, then in retirement, wrote:\r\n\r\n\"I had for a long time ceased to read newspapers or to pay any attention\r\nto public affairs, confident they were in good hands and content to be a\r\npassenger in our bark to the shore from which I am not distant. But this\r\nmomentous question, like a firebell in the night, awakened and filled\r\nme with terror. I considered it at once as the knell of the Union. It is\r\nhushed, indeed, for the moment. But this is a reprieve only, not a final\r\nsentence. A geographical line coinciding with a marked principle, moral\r\nand political, once conceived and held up to the angry passions of men,\r\nwill never be obliterated, and every irritation will mark it deeper and\r\ndeeper. I can say with conscious truth that there is not a man on earth\r\nwho would sacrifice more than I would to relieve us from this heavy\r\nreproach in any practicable way.\r\n\r\n\"The cession of that kind of property--for it is so misnamed--is a\r\nbagatelle which would not cost me a second thought if in that way a\r\ngeneral emancipation and expatriation could be effected, and gradually and\r\nwith due sacrifices I think it might be. But as it is, we have the wolf by\r\nthe ears, and we can neither hold him nor safely let him go. Justice is in\r\none scale, and self-preservation in the other.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clay was in Congress, and, perceiving the danger, at once engaged his\r\nwhole energies to avert it. It began, as I have said, in 1819; and it did\r\nnot terminate till 1821. Missouri would not yield the point; and Congress\r\nthat is, a majority in Congress--by repeated votes showed a determination\r\nnot to admit the State unless it should yield. After several failures,\r\nand great labor on the part of Mr. Clay to so present the question that a\r\nmajority could consent to the admission, it was by a vote rejected, and,\r\nas all seemed to think, finally. A sullen gloom hung over the nation. All\r\nfelt that the rejection of Missouri was equivalent to a dissolution of the\r\nUnion, because those States which already had what Missouri was rejected\r\nfor refusing to relinquish would go with Missouri. All deprecated and\r\ndeplored this, but none saw how to avert it. For the judgment of members\r\nto be convinced of the necessity of yielding was not the whole difficulty;\r\neach had a constituency to meet and to answer to. Mr. Clay, though worn\r\ndown and exhausted, was appealed to by members to renew his efforts at\r\ncompromise. He did so, and by some judicious modifications of his plan,\r\ncoupled with laborious efforts with individual members and his own\r\novermastering eloquence upon that floor, he finally secured the admission\r\nof the State. Brightly and captivating as it had previously shown, it was\r\nnow perceived that his great eloquence was a mere embellishment, or at\r\nmost but a helping hand to his inventive genius and his devotion to his\r\ncountry in the day of her extreme peril.\r\n\r\nAfter the settlement of the Missouri question, although a portion of the\r\nAmerican people have differed with Mr. Clay, and a majority even\r\nappear generally to have been opposed to him on questions of ordinary\r\nadministration, he seems constantly to have been regarded by all as the\r\nman for the crisis. Accordingly, in the days of nullification, and more\r\nrecently in the reappearance of the slavery question connected with\r\nour territory newly acquired of Mexico, the task of devising a mode of\r\nadjustment seems to have been cast upon Mr. Clay by common consent--and\r\nhis performance of the task in each case was little else than a literal\r\nfulfilment of the public expectation.\r\n\r\nMr. Clay's efforts in behalf of the South Americans, and afterward in\r\nbehalf of the Greeks, in the times of their respective struggles for civil\r\nliberty, are among the finest on record, upon the noblest of all themes,\r\nand bear ample corroboration of what I have said was his ruling passion--a\r\nlove of liberty and right, unselfishly, and for their own sakes.\r\n\r\nHaving been led to allude to domestic slavery so frequently already, I am\r\nunwilling to close without referring more particularly to Mr. Clay's\r\nviews and conduct in regard to it. He ever was on principle and in feeling\r\nopposed to slavery. The very earliest, and one of the latest, public\r\nefforts of his life, separated by a period of more than fifty years, were\r\nboth made in favor of gradual emancipation. He did not perceive that on\r\na question of human right the negroes were to be excepted from the human\r\nrace. And yet Mr. Clay was the owner of slaves. Cast into life when\r\nslavery was already widely spread and deeply seated, he did not perceive,\r\nas I think no wise man has perceived, how it could be at once eradicated\r\nwithout producing a greater evil even to the cause of human liberty\r\nitself. His feeling and his judgment, therefore, ever led him to oppose\r\nboth extremes of opinion on the subject. Those who would shiver into\r\nfragments the Union of these States, tear to tatters its now venerated\r\nConstitution, and even burn the last copy of the Bible, rather than\r\nslavery should continue a single hour, together with all their more\r\nhalting sympathizers, have received, and are receiving, their just\r\nexecration; and the name and opinions and influence of Mr. Clay are fully\r\nand, as I trust, effectually and enduringly arrayed against them. But I\r\nwould also, if I could, array his name, opinions, and influence against\r\nthe opposite extreme--against a few but an increasing number of men who,\r\nfor the sake of perpetuating slavery, are beginning to assail and to\r\nridicule the white man's charter of freedom, the declaration that \"all men\r\nare created free and equal.\" So far as I have learned, the first American\r\nof any note to do or attempt this was the late John C. Calhoun; and if I\r\nmistake not, it soon after found its way into some of the messages of the\r\nGovernor of South Carolina. We, however, look for and are not much shocked\r\nby political eccentricities and heresies in South Carolina. But only\r\nlast year I saw with astonishment what purported to be a letter of a very\r\ndistinguished and influential clergyman of Virginia, copied, with apparent\r\napprobation, into a St. Louis newspaper, containing the following to me\r\nvery unsatisfactory language:\r\n\r\n\"I am fully aware that there is a text in some Bibles that is not in mine.\r\nProfessional abolitionists have made more use of it than of any passage in\r\nthe Bible. It came, however, as I trace it, from Saint Voltaire, and was\r\nbaptized by Thomas Jefferson, and since almost universally regarded as\r\ncanonical authority`All men are born free and equal.'\r\n\r\n\"This is a genuine coin in the political currency of our generation. I am\r\nsorry to say that I have never seen two men of whom it is true. But I must\r\nadmit I never saw the Siamese Twins, and therefore will not dogmatically\r\nsay that no man ever saw a proof of this sage aphorism.\"\r\n\r\nThis sounds strangely in republican America. The like was not heard in the\r\nfresher days of the republic. Let us contrast with it the language of that\r\ntruly national man whose life and death we now commemorate and lament: I\r\nquote from a speech of Mr. Clay delivered before the American Colonization\r\nSociety in 1827:\r\n\r\n\"We are reproached with doing mischief by the agitation of this question.\r\nThe society goes into no household to disturb its domestic tranquillity.\r\nIt addresses itself to no slaves to weaken their obligations of obedience.\r\nIt seeks to affect no man's property. It neither has the power nor the\r\nwill to affect the property of any one contrary to his consent. The\r\nexecution of its scheme would augment instead of diminishing the value of\r\nproperty left behind. The society, composed of free men, conceals itself\r\nonly with the free. Collateral consequences we are not responsible for.\r\nIt is not this society which has produced the great moral revolution which\r\nthe age exhibits. What would they who thus reproach us have done? If they\r\nwould repress all tendencies toward liberty and ultimate emancipation,\r\nthey must do more than put down the benevolent efforts of this society.\r\nThey must go back to the era of our liberty and independence, and muzzle\r\nthe cannon which thunders its annual joyous return. They must renew the\r\nslave trade, with all its train of atrocities. They must suppress the\r\nworkings of British philanthropy, seeking to meliorate the condition of\r\nthe unfortunate West Indian slave. They must arrest the career of South\r\nAmerican deliverance from thraldom. They must blow out the moral lights\r\naround us and extinguish that greatest torch of all which America presents\r\nto a benighted world--pointing the way to their rights, their liberties,\r\nand their happiness. And when they have achieved all those purposes their\r\nwork will be yet incomplete. They must penetrate the human soul, and\r\neradicate the light of reason and the love of liberty. Then, and not till\r\nthen, when universal darkness and despair prevail, can you perpetuate\r\nslavery and repress all sympathy and all humane and benevolent efforts\r\namong free men in behalf of the unhappy portion of our race doomed to\r\nbondage.\"\r\n\r\nThe American Colonization Society was organized in 1816. Mr. Clay, though\r\nnot its projector, was one of its earliest members; and he died, as for\r\nmany preceding years he had been, its president. It was one of the\r\nmost cherished objects of his direct care and consideration, and the\r\nassociation of his name with it has probably been its very greatest\r\ncollateral support. He considered it no demerit in the society that it\r\ntended to relieve the slave-holders from the troublesome presence of\r\nthe free negroes; but this was far from being its whole merit in his\r\nestimation. In the same speech from which we have quoted he says:\r\n\r\n\"There is a moral fitness in the idea of returning to Africa her children,\r\nwhose ancestors have been torn from her by the ruthless hand of fraud and\r\nviolence. Transplanted in a foreign land, they will carry back to their\r\nnative soil the rich fruits of religion, civilization, law, and liberty.\r\nMay it not be one of the great designs of the Ruler of the universe, whose\r\nways are often inscrutable by short-sighted mortals, thus to transform an\r\noriginal crime into a signal blessing to that most unfortunate portion of\r\nthe globe?\"\r\n\r\nThis suggestion of the possible ultimate redemption of the African race\r\nand African continent was made twenty-five years ago. Every succeeding\r\nyear has added strength to the hope of its realization. May it indeed be\r\nrealized. Pharaoh's country was cursed with plagues, and his hosts were\r\nlost in the Red Sea, for striving to retain a captive people who had\r\nalready served them more than four hundred years. May like disasters never\r\nbefall us! If, as the friends of colonization hope, the present and coming\r\ngenerations of our countrymen shall by any means succeed in freeing our\r\nland from the dangerous presence of slavery, and at the same time in\r\nrestoring a captive people to their long-lost fatherland with bright\r\nprospects for the future, and this too so gradually that neither races\r\nnor individuals shall have suffered by the change, it will indeed be a\r\nglorious consummation. And if to such a consummation the efforts of Mr.\r\nClay shall have contributed, it will be what he most ardently wished, and\r\nnone of his labors will have been more valuable to his country and his\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nBut Henry Clay is dead. His long and eventful life is closed. Our country\r\nis prosperous and powerful; but could it have been quite all it has\r\nbeen, and is, and is to be, without Henry Clay? Such a man the times have\r\ndemanded, and such in the providence of God was given us. But he is gone.\r\nLet us strive to deserve, as far as mortals may, the continued care of\r\nDivine Providence, trusting that in future national emergencies He will\r\nnot fail to provide us the instruments of safety and security.\r\n\r\nNOTE.

We have examined the present constitution of the\r\nState, the election law of 1849, and the unrepealed parts of the election\r\nlaw in the revised code of 1845; and we are of the opinion that any person\r\ntaking the oath prescribed in the act of 1849 is entitled to vote unless\r\ncounter-proof be made satisfactory to a majority of the judges that such\r\noath is untrue; and that for the purpose of obtaining such counter-proof,\r\nthe proposed voter may be asked questions in the way of cross-examination,\r\nand other independent testimony may be received. We base our opinion as\r\nto receiving counter-proof upon the unrepealed Section nineteen of the\r\nelection law in the revised code.\r\n\r\n\r\n   A. LINCOLN,\r\n   B. S. EDWARDS\r\n   S. T.

STANFORD.\r\n\r\nSIR:--I hope the subject-matter of this letter will appear a sufficient\r\napology to you for the liberty I, a total stranger, take in addressing\r\nyou. The persons here holding two lots under a conveyance made by you, as\r\nthe attorney of Daniel M. Baily, now nearly twenty-two years ago, are in\r\ngreat danger of losing the lots, and very much, perhaps all, is to depend\r\non the testimony you give as to whether you did or did not account to\r\nBaily for the proceeds received by you on this sale of the lots. I,\r\ntherefore, as one of the counsel, beg of you to fully refresh your\r\nrecollection by any means in your power before the time you may be called\r\non to testify. If persons should come about you, and show a disposition to\r\npump you on the subject, it may be no more than prudent to remember that\r\nit may be possible they design to misrepresent you and embarrass the real\r\ntestimony you may ultimately give. It may be six months or a year before\r\nyou are called on to testify.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1854\r\n\r\nTO O. L. DAVIS.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, June 22, 1854.\r\n\r\nO. L. DAVIS, ESQ.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--You, no doubt, remember the enclosed memorandum being handed me\r\nin your office. I have just made the desired search, and find that no such\r\ndeed has ever been here. Campbell, the auditor, says that if it were here,\r\nit would be in his office, and that he has hunted for it a dozen times,\r\nand could never find it. He says that one time and another, he has heard\r\nmuch about the matter, that it was not a deed for Right of Way, but a\r\ndeed, outright, for Depot-ground--at least, a sale for Depot-ground, and\r\nthere may never have been a deed. He says, if there is a deed, it is most\r\nprobable General Alexander, of Paris, has it.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEBRASKA MEASURE\r\n\r\nTO J. M. PALMER\r\n\r\n[Confidential]\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Sept. 7, 1854.\r\n\r\nHON. J. M. PALMER.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--You know how anxious I am that this Nebraska measure shall be\r\nrebuked and condemned everywhere. Of course I hope something from your\r\nposition; yet I do not expect you to do anything which may be wrong in\r\nyour own judgment; nor would I have you do anything personally injurious\r\nto yourself. You are, and always have been, honestly and sincerely a\r\nDemocrat; and I know how painful it must be to an honest, sincere man to\r\nbe urged by his party to the support of a measure which in his conscience\r\nhe believes to be wrong. You have had a severe struggle with yourself, and\r\nyou have determined not to swallow the wrong. Is it not just to yourself\r\nthat you should, in a few public speeches, state your reasons, and thus\r\njustify yourself? I wish you would; and yet I say, don't do it, if you\r\nthink it will injure you. You may have given your word to vote for Major\r\nHarris; and if so, of course you will stick to it. But allow me to suggest\r\nthat you should avoid speaking of this; for it probably would induce some\r\nof your friends in like manner to cast their votes. You understand. And\r\nnow let me beg your pardon for obtruding this letter upon you, to whom\r\nI have ever been opposed in politics. Had your party omitted to make\r\nNebraska a test of party fidelity, you probably would have been the\r\nDemocratic candidate for Congress in the district. You deserved it, and\r\nI believe it would have been given you. In that case I should have been\r\nquite happy that Nebraska was to be rebuked at all events. I still should\r\nhave voted for the Whig candidate; but I should have made no speeches,\r\nwritten no letters; and you would have been elected by at least a thousand\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A. B. MOREAU.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, September 7, 1854\r\n\r\nA. B. MOREAU, ESQ.\r\n\r\nSIR:--Stranger though I am, personally, being a brother in the faith, I\r\nventure to write you. Yates can not come to your court next week. He\r\nis obliged to be at Pike court where he has a case, with a fee of five\r\nhundred dollars, two hundred dollars already paid. To neglect it would be\r\nunjust to himself, and dishonest to his client. Harris will be with you,\r\nhead up and tail up, for Nebraska. You must have some one to make an\r\nanti-Nebraska speech. Palmer is the best, if you can get him, I think. Jo.\r\nGillespie, if you can not get Palmer, and somebody anyhow, if you can\r\nget neither. But press Palmer hard. It is in his Senatorial district, I\r\nbelieve.\r\n\r\nYours etc.,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO SENATOR DOUGLAS--PEORIA SPEECH\r\n\r\nSPEECH AT PEORIA, ILLINOIS, IN REPLY TO SENATOR DOUGLAS,\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 16, 1854.\r\n\r\nI do not rise to speak now, if I can stipulate with the audience to meet\r\nme here at half-past six or at seven o'clock. It is now several minutes\r\npast five, and Judge Douglas has spoken over three hours. If you hear me\r\nat all, I wish you to hear me through. It will take me as long as it has\r\ntaken him. That will carry us beyond eight o'clock at night. Now, every\r\none of you who can remain that long can just as well get his supper,\r\nmeet me at seven, and remain an hour or two later. The Judge has already\r\ninformed you that he is to have an hour to reply to me. I doubt not but\r\nyou have been a little surprised to learn that I have consented to give\r\none of his high reputation and known ability this advantage of me. Indeed,\r\nmy consenting to it, though reluctant, was not wholly unselfish, for I\r\nsuspected, if it were understood that the Judge was entirely done, you\r\nDemocrats would leave and not hear me; but by giving him the close, I felt\r\nconfident you would stay for the fun of hearing him skin me.\r\n\r\nThe audience signified their assent to the arrangement, and adjourned to\r\nseven o'clock P.M., at which time they reassembled, and Mr. Lincoln spoke\r\nsubstantially as follows:\r\n\r\nThe repeal of the Missouri Compromise, and the propriety of its\r\nrestoration, constitute the subject of what I am about to say. As I desire\r\nto present my own connected view of this subject, my remarks will not\r\nbe specifically an answer to Judge Douglas; yet, as I proceed, the main\r\npoints he has presented will arise, and will receive such respectful\r\nattention as I may be able to give them. I wish further to say that I do\r\nnot propose to question the patriotism or to assail the motives of any man\r\nor class of men, but rather to confine myself strictly to the naked\r\nmerits of the question. I also wish to be no less than national in all\r\nthe positions I may take, and whenever I take ground which others have\r\nthought, or may think, narrow, sectional, and dangerous to the Union, I\r\nhope to give a reason which will appear sufficient, at least to some, why\r\nI think differently.\r\n\r\nAnd as this subject is no other than part and parcel of the larger general\r\nquestion of domestic slavery, I wish to make and to keep the distinction\r\nbetween the existing institution and the extension of it so broad and\r\nso clear that no honest man can misunderstand me, and no dishonest one\r\nsuccessfully misrepresent me.\r\n\r\nIn order to a clear understanding of what the Missouri Compromise is, a\r\nshort history of the preceding kindred subjects will perhaps be proper.\r\n\r\nWhen we established our independence, we did not own or claim the\r\ncountry to which this compromise applies. Indeed, strictly speaking, the\r\nConfederacy then owned no country at all; the States respectively owned\r\nthe country within their limits, and some of them owned territory\r\nbeyond their strict State limits. Virginia thus owned the Northwestern\r\nTerritory--the country out of which the principal part of Ohio, all\r\nIndiana, all Illinois, all Michigan, and all Wisconsin have since been\r\nformed. She also owned (perhaps within her then limits) what has since\r\nbeen formed into the State of Kentucky. North Carolina thus owned what\r\nis now the State of Tennessee; and South Carolina and Georgia owned,\r\nin separate parts, what are now Mississippi and Alabama. Connecticut, I\r\nthink, owned the little remaining part of Ohio, being the same where they\r\nnow send Giddings to Congress and beat all creation in making cheese.\r\n\r\nThese territories, together with the States themselves, constitute all the\r\ncountry over which the Confederacy then claimed any sort of jurisdiction.\r\nWe were then living under the Articles of Confederation, which were\r\nsuperseded by the Constitution several years afterward. The question of\r\nceding the territories to the General Government was set on foot. Mr.\r\nJefferson,--the author of the Declaration of Independence, and otherwise\r\na chief actor in the Revolution; then a delegate in Congress; afterward,\r\ntwice President; who was, is, and perhaps will continue to be, the\r\nmost distinguished politician of our history; a Virginian by birth and\r\ncontinued residence, and withal a slaveholder,--conceived the idea of\r\ntaking that occasion to prevent slavery ever going into the Northwestern\r\nTerritory. He prevailed on the Virginia Legislature to adopt his views,\r\nand to cede the Territory, making the prohibition of slavery therein\r\na condition of the deed. (Jefferson got only an understanding, not a\r\ncondition of the deed to this wish.) Congress accepted the cession with\r\nthe condition; and the first ordinance (which the acts of Congress were\r\nthen called) for the government of the Territory provided that slavery\r\nshould never be permitted therein. This is the famed \"Ordinance of '87,\"\r\nso often spoken of.\r\n\r\nThenceforward for sixty-one years, and until, in 1848, the last scrap of\r\nthis Territory came into the Union as the State of Wisconsin, all parties\r\nacted in quiet obedience to this ordinance. It is now what Jefferson\r\nforesaw and intended--the happy home of teeming millions of free, white,\r\nprosperous people, and no slave among them.\r\n\r\nThus, with the author of the Declaration of Independence, the policy of\r\nprohibiting slavery in new territory originated. Thus, away back to the\r\nConstitution, in the pure, fresh, free breath of the Revolution, the State\r\nof Virginia and the national Congress put that policy into practice. Thus,\r\nthrough more than sixty of the best years of the republic, did that policy\r\nsteadily work to its great and beneficent end. And thus, in those five\r\nStates, and in five millions of free, enterprising people, we have before\r\nus the rich fruits of this policy.\r\n\r\nBut now new light breaks upon us. Now Congress declares this ought never\r\nto have been, and the like of it must never be again. The sacred right of\r\nself-government is grossly violated by it. We even find some men who drew\r\ntheir first breath--and every other breath of their lives--under this very\r\nrestriction, now live in dread of absolute suffocation if they should\r\nbe restricted in the \"sacred right\" of taking slaves to Nebraska. That\r\nperfect liberty they sigh for--the liberty of making slaves of other\r\npeople, Jefferson never thought of, their own fathers never thought of,\r\nthey never thought of themselves, a year ago. How fortunate for them they\r\ndid not sooner become sensible of their great misery! Oh, how difficult it\r\nis to treat with respect such assaults upon all we have ever really held\r\nsacred!\r\n\r\nBut to return to history. In 1803 we purchased what was then called\r\nLouisiana, of France. It included the present States of Louisiana,\r\nArkansas, Missouri, and Iowa; also the Territory of Minnesota, and the\r\npresent bone of contention, Kansas and Nebraska. Slavery already existed\r\namong the French at New Orleans, and to some extent at St. Louis. In 1812\r\nLouisiana came into the Union as a slave State, without controversy. In\r\n1818 or '19, Missouri showed signs of a wish to come in with slavery. This\r\nwas resisted by Northern members of Congress; and thus began the first\r\ngreat slavery agitation in the nation. This controversy lasted several\r\nmonths, and became very angry and exciting--the House of Representatives\r\nvoting steadily for the prohibition of slavery in Missouri, and the Senate\r\nvoting as steadily against it. Threats of the breaking up of the Union\r\nwere freely made, and the ablest public men of the day became seriously\r\nalarmed. At length a compromise was made, in which, as in all compromises,\r\nboth sides yielded something. It was a law, passed on the 6th of March,\r\n1820, providing that Missouri might come into the Union with slavery, but\r\nthat in all the remaining part of the territory purchased of France\r\nwhich lies north of thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes north latitude,\r\nslavery should never be permitted. This provision of law is the \"Missouri\r\nCompromise.\" In excluding slavery north of the line, the same language\r\nis employed as in the Ordinance of 1787. It directly applied to Iowa,\r\nMinnesota, and to the present bone of contention, Kansas and Nebraska.\r\nWhether there should or should not be slavery south of that line, nothing\r\nwas said in the law. But Arkansas constituted the principal remaining\r\npart south of the line; and it has since been admitted as a slave State,\r\nwithout serious controversy. More recently, Iowa, north of the line, came\r\nin as a free State without controversy. Still later, Minnesota, north\r\nof the line, had a territorial organization without controversy. Texas,\r\nprincipally south of the line, and west of Arkansas, though originally\r\nwithin the purchase from France, had, in 1819, been traded off to Spain\r\nin our treaty for the acquisition of Florida. It had thus become a part\r\nof Mexico. Mexico revolutionized and became independent of Spain. American\r\ncitizens began settling rapidly with their slaves in the southern part\r\nof Texas. Soon they revolutionized against Mexico, and established an\r\nindependent government of their own, adopting a constitution with slavery,\r\nstrongly resembling the constitutions of our slave States. By still\r\nanother rapid move, Texas, claiming a boundary much farther west than when\r\nwe parted with her in 1819, was brought back to the United States, and\r\nadmitted into the Union as a slave State. Then there was little or no\r\nsettlement in the northern part of Texas, a considerable portion of which\r\nlay north of the Missouri line; and in the resolutions admitting her into\r\nthe Union, the Missouri restriction was expressly extended westward across\r\nher territory. This was in 1845, only nine years ago.\r\n\r\nThus originated the Missouri Compromise; and thus has it been respected\r\ndown to 1845. And even four years later, in 1849, our distinguished\r\nSenator, in a public address, held the following language in relation to\r\nit:\r\n\r\n\"The Missouri Compromise has been in practical operation for about a\r\nquarter of a century, and has received the sanction and approbation of men\r\nof all parties in every section of the Union. It has allayed all sectional\r\njealousies and irritations growing out of this vexed question, and\r\nharmonized and tranquillized the whole country. It has given to Henry\r\nClay, as its prominent champion, the proud sobriquet of the 'Great\r\nPacificator,' and by that title, and for that service, his political\r\nfriends had repeatedly appealed to the people to rally under his standard\r\nas a Presidential candidate, as the man who had exhibited the patriotism\r\nand power to suppress an unholy and treasonable agitation, and preserve\r\nthe Union. He was not aware that any man or any party, from any section\r\nof the Union, had ever urged as an objection to Mr. Clay that he was the\r\ngreat champion of the Missouri Compromise. On the contrary, the effort was\r\nmade by the opponents of Mr. Clay to prove that he was not entitled to the\r\nexclusive merit of that great patriotic measure, and that the honor was\r\nequally due to others, as well as to him, for securing its adoption;\r\nthat it had its origin in the hearts of all patriotic men, who desired\r\nto preserve and perpetuate the blessings of our glorious Union--an origin\r\nakin to that of the Constitution of the United States, conceived in the\r\nsame spirit of fraternal affection, and calculated to remove forever the\r\nonly danger which seemed to threaten, at some distant day, to sever the\r\nsocial bond of union. All the evidences of public opinion at that day\r\nseemed to indicate that this compromise had been canonized in the hearts\r\nof the American people, as a sacred thing which no ruthless hand would\r\never be reckless enough to disturb.\"\r\n\r\nI do not read this extract to involve Judge Douglas in an inconsistency.\r\nIf he afterward thought he had been wrong, it was right for him to change.\r\nI bring this forward merely to show the high estimate placed on the\r\nMissouri Compromise by all parties up to so late as the year 1849.\r\n\r\nBut going back a little in point of time. Our war with Mexico broke out\r\nin 1846. When Congress was about adjourning that session, President Polk\r\nasked them to place two millions of dollars under his control, to be used\r\nby him in the recess, if found practicable and expedient, in negotiating\r\na treaty of peace with Mexico, and acquiring some part of her territory. A\r\nbill was duly gotten up for the purpose, and was progressing swimmingly in\r\nthe House of Representatives, when a member by the name of David Wilmot, a\r\nDemocrat from Pennsylvania, moved as an amendment, \"Provided, that in any\r\nterritory thus acquired there never shall be slavery.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the origin of the far-famed Wilmot Proviso. It created a great\r\nflutter; but it stuck like wax, was voted into the bill, and the bill\r\npassed with it through the House. The Senate, however, adjourned without\r\nfinal action on it, and so both appropriation and proviso were lost for\r\nthe time. The war continued, and at the next session the President renewed\r\nhis request for the appropriation, enlarging the amount, I think, to\r\nthree millions. Again came the proviso, and defeated the measure. Congress\r\nadjourned again, and the war went on. In December, 1847, the new Congress\r\nassembled. I was in the lower House that term. The Wilmot Proviso, or the\r\nprinciple of it, was constantly coming up in some shape or other, and I\r\nthink I may venture to say I voted for it at least forty times during\r\nthe short time I was there. The Senate, however, held it in check, and it\r\nnever became a law. In the spring of 1848 a treaty of peace was made\r\nwith Mexico, by which we obtained that portion of her country which now\r\nconstitutes the Territories of New Mexico and Utah and the present State\r\nof California. By this treaty the Wilmot Proviso was defeated, in so far\r\nas it was intended to be a condition of the acquisition of territory.\r\nIts friends, however, were still determined to find some way to restrain\r\nslavery from getting into the new country. This new acquisition lay\r\ndirectly west of our old purchase from France, and extended west to the\r\nPacific Ocean, and was so situated that if the Missouri line should be\r\nextended straight west, the new country would be divided by such extended\r\nline, leaving some north and some south of it. On Judge Douglas's motion,\r\na bill, or provision of a bill, passed the Senate to so extend the\r\nMissouri line. The proviso men in the House, including myself, voted it\r\ndown, because, by implication, it gave up the southern part to slavery,\r\nwhile we were bent on having it all free.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1848 the gold-mines were discovered in California. This\r\nattracted people to it with unprecedented rapidity, so that on, or soon\r\nafter, the meeting of the new Congress in December, 1849, she already had\r\na population of nearly a hundred thousand, had called a convention, formed\r\na State constitution excluding slavery, and was knocking for admission\r\ninto the Union. The proviso men, of course, were for letting her in,\r\nbut the Senate, always true to the other side, would not consent to her\r\nadmission, and there California stood, kept out of the Union because\r\nshe would not let slavery into her borders. Under all the circumstances,\r\nperhaps, this was not wrong. There were other points of dispute connected\r\nwith the general question of Slavery, which equally needed adjustment. The\r\nSouth clamored for a more efficient fugitive slave law. The North clamored\r\nfor the abolition of a peculiar species of slave trade in the District\r\nof Columbia, in connection with which, in view from the windows of the\r\nCapitol, a sort of negro livery-stable, where droves of negroes were\r\ncollected, temporarily kept, and finally taken to Southern markets,\r\nprecisely like droves of horses, had been openly maintained for fifty\r\nyears. Utah and New Mexico needed territorial governments; and whether\r\nslavery should or should not be prohibited within them was another\r\nquestion. The indefinite western boundary of Texas was to be settled. She\r\nwas a slave State, and consequently the farther west the slavery men could\r\npush her boundary, the more slave country they secured; and the farther\r\neast the slavery opponents could thrust the boundary back, the less slave\r\nground was secured. Thus this was just as clearly a slavery question as\r\nany of the others.\r\n\r\nThese points all needed adjustment, and they were held up, perhaps wisely,\r\nto make them help adjust one another. The Union now, as in 1820, was\r\nthought to be in danger, and devotion to the Union rightfully inclined\r\nmen to yield somewhat in points where nothing else could have so inclined\r\nthem. A compromise was finally effected. The South got their new fugitive\r\nslave law, and the North got California, (by far the best part of our\r\nacquisition from Mexico) as a free State. The South got a provision that\r\nNew Mexico and Utah, when admitted as States, may come in with or without\r\nslavery as they may then choose; and the North got the slave trade\r\nabolished in the District of Columbia.. The North got the western boundary\r\nof Texas thrown farther back eastward than the South desired; but, in\r\nturn, they gave Texas ten millions of dollars with which to pay her old\r\ndebts. This is the Compromise of 1850.\r\n\r\nPreceding the Presidential election of 1852, each of the great political\r\nparties, Democrats and Whigs, met in convention and adopted resolutions\r\nindorsing the Compromise of '50, as a \"finality,\" a final settlement, so\r\nfar as these parties could make it so, of all slavery agitation. Previous\r\nto this, in 1851, the Illinois Legislature had indorsed it.\r\n\r\nDuring this long period of time, Nebraska (the Nebraska Territory, not\r\nthe State of as we know it now) had remained substantially an uninhabited\r\ncountry, but now emigration to and settlement within it began to take\r\nplace. It is about one third as large as the present United States,\r\nand its importance, so long overlooked, begins to come into view. The\r\nrestriction of slavery by the Missouri Compromise directly applies to\r\nit--in fact was first made, and has since been maintained expressly for\r\nit. In 1853, a bill to give it a territorial government passed the House\r\nof Representatives, and, in the hands of Judge Douglas, failed of passing\r\nonly for want of time. This bill contained no repeal of the Missouri\r\nCompromise. Indeed, when it was assailed because it did not contain such\r\nrepeal, Judge Douglas defended it in its existing form. On January 4,\r\n1854, Judge Douglas introduces a new bill to give Nebraska territorial\r\ngovernment. He accompanies this bill with a report, in which last he\r\nexpressly recommends that the Missouri Compromise shall neither be\r\naffirmed nor repealed. Before long the bill is so modified as to make two\r\nterritories instead of one, calling the southern one Kansas.\r\n\r\nAlso, about a month after the introduction of the bill, on the Judge's own\r\nmotion it is so amended as to declare the Missouri Compromise inoperative\r\nand void; and, substantially, that the people who go and settle there may\r\nestablish slavery, or exclude it, as they may see fit. In this shape the\r\nbill passed both branches of Congress and became a law.\r\n\r\nThis is the repeal of the Missouri Compromise. The foregoing history\r\nmay not be precisely accurate in every particular, but I am sure it is\r\nsufficiently so for all the use I shall attempt to make of it, and in\r\nit we have before us the chief material enabling us to judge correctly\r\nwhether the repeal of the Missouri Compromise is right or wrong. I think,\r\nand shall try to show, that it is wrong--wrong in its direct effect,\r\nletting slavery into Kansas and Nebraska, and wrong in its prospective\r\nprinciple, allowing it to spread to every other part of the wide world\r\nwhere men can be found inclined to take it.\r\n\r\nThis declared indifference, but, as I must think, covert real zeal,\r\nfor the spread of slavery, I cannot but hate. I hate it because of the\r\nmonstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our\r\nrepublican example of its just influence in the world; enables the enemies\r\nof free institutions with plausibility to taunt us as hypocrites; causes\r\nthe real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity; and especially because\r\nit forces so many good men among ourselves into an open war with the very\r\nfundamental principles of civil liberty, criticizing the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, and insisting that there is no right principle of action but\r\nself-interest.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding let me say that I think I have no prejudice against the\r\nSouthern people. They are just what we would be in their situation. If\r\nslavery did not now exist among them, they would not introduce it. If it\r\ndid now exist among us, we should not instantly give it up. This I believe\r\nof the masses North and South. Doubtless there are individuals on both\r\nsides who would not hold slaves under any circumstances, and others who\r\nwould gladly introduce slavery anew if it were out of existence. We know\r\nthat some Southern men do free their slaves, go North and become tip-top\r\nabolitionists, while some Northern ones go South and become most cruel\r\nslave masters.\r\n\r\nWhen Southern people tell us that they are no more responsible for the\r\norigin of slavery than we are, I acknowledge the fact. When it is said\r\nthat the institution exists, and that it is very difficult to get rid of\r\nit in any satisfactory way, I can understand and appreciate the saying. I\r\nsurely will not blame them for not doing what I should not know how to do\r\nmyself. If all earthly power were given me, I should not know what to do\r\nas to the existing institution. My first impulse would be to free all the\r\nslaves, and send them to Liberia, to their own native land. But a moment's\r\nreflection would convince me that whatever of high hope (as I think\r\nthere is) there may be in this in the long run, its sudden execution is\r\nimpossible. If they were all landed there in a day, they would all perish\r\nin the next ten days; and there are not surplus shipping and surplus money\r\nenough to carry them there in many times ten days. What then? Free them\r\nall, and keep them among us as underlings? Is it quite certain that this\r\nbetters their condition? I think I would not hold one in slavery at any\r\nrate, yet the point is not clear enough for me to denounce people upon.\r\nWhat next? Free them, and make them politically and socially our equals?\r\nMy own feelings will not admit of this, and if mine would, we well know\r\nthat those of the great mass of whites will not. Whether this feeling\r\naccords with justice and sound judgment is not the sole question, if\r\nindeed it is any part of it. A universal feeling, whether well or ill\r\nfounded, cannot be safely disregarded. We cannot then make them equals. It\r\ndoes seem to me that systems of gradual emancipation might be adopted, but\r\nfor their tardiness in this I will not undertake to judge our brethren of\r\nthe South.\r\n\r\nWhen they remind us of their constitutional rights, I acknowledge\r\nthem--not grudgingly, but fully and fairly; and I would give them any\r\nlegislation for the reclaiming of their fugitives which should not in\r\nits stringency be more likely to carry a free man into slavery than our\r\nordinary criminal laws are to hang an innocent one.\r\n\r\nBut all this, to my judgment, furnishes no more excuse for permitting\r\nslavery to go into our own free territory than it would for reviving the\r\nAfrican slave trade by law. The law which forbids the bringing of slaves\r\nfrom Africa, and that which has so long forbidden the taking of them\r\ninto Nebraska, can hardy be distinguished on any moral principle, and the\r\nrepeal of the former could find quite as plausible excuses as that of the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nThe arguments by which the repeal of the Missouri Compromise is sought to\r\nbe justified are these:\r\n\r\nFirst. That the Nebraska country needed a territorial government.\r\n\r\nSecond. That in various ways the public had repudiated that compromise and\r\ndemanded the repeal, and therefore should not now complain of it.\r\n\r\n And, lastly, That the repeal establishes a principle which is\r\nintrinsically right.\r\n\r\nI will attempt an answer to each of them in its turn.\r\n\r\nFirst, then: If that country was in need of a territorial organization,\r\ncould it not have had it as well without as with a repeal? Iowa and\r\nMinnesota, to both of which the Missouri restriction applied, had, without\r\nits repeal, each in succession, territorial organizations. And even the\r\nyear before, a bill for Nebraska itself was within an ace of passing\r\nwithout the repealing clause, and this in the hands of the same men who\r\nare now the champions of repeal. Why no necessity then for repeal? But\r\nstill later, when this very bill was first brought in, it contained\r\nno repeal. But, say they, because the people had demanded, or rather\r\ncommanded, the repeal, the repeal was to accompany the organization\r\nwhenever that should occur.\r\n\r\nNow, I deny that the public ever demanded any such thing--ever repudiated\r\nthe Missouri Compromise, ever commanded its repeal. I deny it, and call\r\nfor the proof. It is not contended, I believe, that any such command has\r\never been given in express terms. It is only said that it was done in\r\nprinciple. The support of the Wilmot Proviso is the first fact mentioned\r\nto prove that the Missouri restriction was repudiated in principle, and\r\nthe second is the refusal to extend the Missouri line over the country\r\nacquired from Mexico. These are near enough alike to be treated together.\r\nThe one was to exclude the chances of slavery from the whole new\r\nacquisition by the lump, and the other was to reject a division of it, by\r\nwhich one half was to be given up to those chances. Now, whether this was\r\na repudiation of the Missouri line in principle depends upon whether the\r\nMissouri law contained any principle requiring the line to be extended\r\nover the country acquired from Mexico. I contend it did not. I insist\r\nthat it contained no general principle, but that it was, in every sense,\r\nspecific. That its terms limit it to the country purchased from France is\r\nundenied and undeniable. It could have no principle beyond the intention\r\nof those who made it. They did not intend to extend the line to country\r\nwhich they did not own. If they intended to extend it in the event of\r\nacquiring additional territory, why did they not say so? It was just as\r\neasy to say that \"in all the country west of the Mississippi which we now\r\nown, or may hereafter acquire, there shall never be slavery,\" as to say\r\nwhat they did say; and they would have said it if they had meant it. An\r\nintention to extend the law is not only not mentioned in the law, but is\r\nnot mentioned in any contemporaneous history. Both the law itself, and the\r\nhistory of the times, are a blank as to any principle of extension; and\r\nby neither the known rules of construing statutes and contracts, nor by\r\ncommon sense, can any such principle be inferred.\r\n\r\nAnother fact showing the specific character of the Missouri law--showing\r\nthat it intended no more than it expressed, showing that the line was not\r\nintended as a universal dividing line between Free and Slave territory,\r\npresent and prospective, north of which slavery could never go--is the\r\nfact that by that very law Missouri came in as a slave State, north of the\r\nline. If that law contained any prospective principle, the whole law must\r\nbe looked to in order to ascertain what the principle was. And by this\r\nrule the South could fairly contend that, inasmuch as they got one slave\r\nState north of the line at the inception of the law, they have the right\r\nto have another given them north of it occasionally, now and then, in the\r\nindefinite westward extension of the line. This demonstrates the absurdity\r\nof attempting to deduce a prospective principle from the Missouri\r\nCompromise line.\r\n\r\nWhen we voted for the Wilmot Proviso we were voting to keep slavery out\r\nof the whole Mexican acquisition, and little did we think we were thereby\r\nvoting to let it into Nebraska lying several hundred miles distant. When\r\nwe voted against extending the Missouri line, little did we think we were\r\nvoting to destroy the old line, then of near thirty years' standing.\r\n\r\nTo argue that we thus repudiated the Missouri Compromise is no less absurd\r\nthan it would be to argue that because we have so far forborne to acquire\r\nCuba, we have thereby, in principle, repudiated our former acquisitions\r\nand determined to throw them out of the Union. No less absurd than it\r\nwould be to say that because I may have refused to build an addition to\r\nmy house, I thereby have decided to destroy the existing house! And if\r\nI catch you setting fire to my house, you will turn upon me and say I\r\ninstructed you to do it!\r\n\r\nThe most conclusive argument, however, that while for the Wilmot Proviso,\r\nand while voting against the extension of the Missouri line, we never\r\nthought of disturbing the original Missouri Compromise, is found in the\r\nfact that there was then, and still is, an unorganized tract of fine\r\ncountry, nearly as large as the State of Missouri, lying immediately west\r\nof Arkansas and south of the Missouri Compromise line, and that we never\r\nattempted to prohibit slavery as to it. I wish particular attention to\r\nthis. It adjoins the original Missouri Compromise line by its northern\r\nboundary, and consequently is part of the country into which by\r\nimplication slavery was permitted to go by that compromise. There it has\r\nlain open ever s, and there it still lies, and yet no effort has been made\r\nat any time to wrest it from the South. In all our struggles to prohibit\r\nslavery within our Mexican acquisitions, we never so much as lifted a\r\nfinger to prohibit it as to this tract. Is not this entirely conclusive\r\nthat at all times we have held the Missouri Compromise as a sacred thing,\r\neven when against ourselves as well as when for us?\r\n\r\nSenator Douglas sometimes says the Missouri line itself was in principle\r\nonly an extension of the line of the Ordinance of '87--that is to say, an\r\nextension of the Ohio River. I think this is weak enough on its face. I\r\nwill remark, however, that, as a glance at the map will show, the Missouri\r\nline is a long way farther south than the Ohio, and that if our Senator in\r\nproposing his extension had stuck to the principle of jogging southward,\r\nperhaps it might not have been voted down so readily.\r\n\r\nBut next it is said that the compromises of '50, and the ratification of\r\nthem by both political parties in '52, established a new principle which\r\nrequired the repeal of the Missouri Compromise. This again I deny. I deny\r\nit, and demand the proof. I have already stated fully what the compromises\r\nof '50 are. That particular part of those measures from which the virtual\r\nrepeal of the Missouri Compromise is sought to be inferred (for it is\r\nadmitted they contain nothing about it in express terms) is the provision\r\nin the Utah and New Mexico laws which permits them when they seek\r\nadmission into the Union as States to come in with or without slavery, as\r\nthey shall then see fit. Now I insist this provision was made for Utah\r\nand New Mexico, and for no other place whatever. It had no more direct\r\nreference to Nebraska than it had to the territories of the moon. But,\r\nsay they, it had reference to Nebraska in principle. Let us see. The\r\nNorth consented to this provision, not because they considered it right in\r\nitself, but because they were compensated--paid for it.\r\n\r\nThey at the same time got California into the Union as a free State. This\r\nwas far the best part of all they had struggled for by the Wilmot Proviso.\r\nThey also got the area of slavery somewhat narrowed in the settlement\r\nof the boundary of Texas. Also they got the slave trade abolished in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia.\r\n\r\nFor all these desirable objects the North could afford to yield something;\r\nand they did yield to the South the Utah and New Mexico provision. I do\r\nnot mean that the whole North, or even a majority, yielded, when the law\r\npassed; but enough yielded--when added to the vote of the South, to\r\ncarry the measure. Nor can it be pretended that the principle of this\r\narrangement requires us to permit the same provision to be applied to\r\nNebraska, without any equivalent at all. Give us another free State; press\r\nthe boundary of Texas still farther back; give us another step toward the\r\ndestruction of slavery in the District, and you present us a similar case.\r\nBut ask us not to repeat, for nothing, what you paid for in the first\r\ninstance. If you wish the thing again, pay again. That is the principle of\r\nthe compromises of '50, if, indeed, they had any principles beyond their\r\nspecific terms--it was the system of equivalents.\r\n\r\nAgain, if Congress, at that time, intended that all future Territories\r\nshould, when admitted as States, come in with or without slavery at their\r\nown option, why did it not say so? With such a universal provision, all\r\nknow the bills could not have passed. Did they, then--could they-establish\r\na principle contrary to their own intention? Still further, if they\r\nintended to establish the principle that, whenever Congress had control,\r\nit should be left to the people to do as they thought fit with slavery,\r\nwhy did they not authorize the people of the District of Columbia, at\r\ntheir option, to abolish slavery within their limits?\r\n\r\nI personally know that this has not been left undone because it was\r\nunthought of. It was frequently spoken of by members of Congress, and by\r\ncitizens of Washington, six years ago; and I heard no one express a doubt\r\nthat a system of gradual emancipation, with compensation to owners,\r\nwould meet the approbation of a large majority of the white people of the\r\nDistrict. But without the action of Congress they could say nothing; and\r\nCongress said \"No.\" In the measures of 1850, Congress had the subject of\r\nslavery in the District expressly on hand. If they were then establishing\r\nthe principle of allowing the people to do as they please with slavery,\r\nwhy did they not apply the principle to that people?\r\n\r\nAgain it is claimed that by the resolutions of the Illinois Legislature,\r\npassed in 1851, the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was demanded. This\r\nI deny also. Whatever may be worked out by a criticism of the language of\r\nthose resolutions, the people have never understood them as being any\r\nmore than an indorsement of the compromises of 1850, and a release of our\r\nsenators from voting for the Wilmot Proviso. The whole people are living\r\nwitnesses that this only was their view. Finally, it is asked, \"If we\r\ndid not mean to apply the Utah and New Mexico provision to all future\r\nterritories, what did we mean when we, in 1852, indorsed the compromises\r\nof 1850?\"\r\n\r\nFor myself I can answer this question most easily. I meant not to ask a\r\nrepeal or modification of the Fugitive Slave law. I meant not to ask\r\nfor the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia. I meant not to\r\nresist the admission of Utah and New Mexico, even should they ask to come\r\nin as slave States. I meant nothing about additional Territories, because,\r\nas I understood, we then had no Territory whose character as to slavery\r\nwas not already settled. As to Nebraska, I regarded its character as being\r\nfixed by the Missouri Compromise for thirty years--as unalterably fixed\r\nas that of my own home in Illinois. As to new acquisitions, I said,\r\n\"Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.\" When we make new\r\nacquisitions, we will, as heretofore, try to manage them somehow. That is\r\nmy answer; that is what I meant and said; and I appeal to the people to\r\nsay each for himself whether that is not also the universal meaning of the\r\nfree States.\r\n\r\nAnd now, in turn, let me ask a few questions. If, by any or all these\r\nmatters, the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was commanded, why was not\r\nthe command sooner obeyed? Why was the repeal omitted in the Nebraska\r\nBill of 1853? Why was it omitted in the original bill of 1854? Why in the\r\naccompanying report was such a repeal characterized as a departure from\r\nthe course pursued in 1850 and its continued omission recommended?\r\n\r\nI am aware Judge Douglas now argues that the subsequent express repeal is\r\nno substantial alteration of the bill. This argument seems wonderful to\r\nme. It is as if one should argue that white and black are not different.\r\nHe admits, however, that there is a literal change in the bill, and that\r\nhe made the change in deference to other senators who would not support\r\nthe bill without. This proves that those other senators thought the\r\nchange a substantial one, and that the Judge thought their opinions worth\r\ndeferring to. His own opinions, therefore, seem not to rest on a very firm\r\nbasis, even in his own mind; and I suppose the world believes, and will\r\ncontinue to believe, that precisely on the substance of that change this\r\nwhole agitation has arisen.\r\n\r\nI conclude, then, that the public never demanded the repeal of the\r\nMissouri Compromise.\r\n\r\nI now come to consider whether the appeal with its avowed principles, is\r\nintrinsically right. I insist that it is not. Take the particular case. A\r\ncontroversy had arisen between the advocates and opponents of slavery,\r\nin relation to its establishment within the country we had purchased of\r\nFrance. The southern, and then best, part of the purchase was already in\r\nas a slave State. The controversy was settled by also letting Missouri\r\nin as a slave State; but with the agreement that within all the remaining\r\npart of the purchase, north of a certain line, there should never be\r\nslavery. As to what was to be done with the remaining part, south of the\r\nline, nothing was said; but perhaps the fair implication was, it should\r\ncome in with slavery if it should so choose. The southern part, except a\r\nportion heretofore mentioned, afterward did come in with slavery, as the\r\nState of Arkansas. All these many years, since 1820, the northern part\r\nhad remained a wilderness. At length settlements began in it also. In due\r\ncourse Iowa came in as a free State, and Minnesota was given a territorial\r\ngovernment, without removing the slavery restriction. Finally, the\r\nsole remaining part north of the line--Kansas and Nebraska--was to be\r\norganized; and it is proposed, and carried, to blot out the old dividing\r\nline of thirty-four years' standing, and to open the whole of that country\r\nto the introduction of slavery. Now this, to my mind, is manifestly\r\nunjust. After an angry and dangerous controversy, the parties made friends\r\nby dividing the bone of contention. The one party first appropriates her\r\nown share, beyond all power to be disturbed in the possession of it, and\r\nthen seizes the share of the other party. It is as if two starving men had\r\ndivided their only loaf, the one had hastily swallowed his half, and then\r\ngrabbed the other's half just as he was putting it to his mouth.\r\n\r\nLet me here drop the main argument, to notice what I consider rather\r\nan inferior matter. It is argued that slavery will not go to Kansas and\r\nNebraska, in any event. This is a palliation, a lullaby. I have some hope\r\nthat it will not; but let us not be too confident. As to climate, a glance\r\nat the map shows that there are five slave States--Delaware, Maryland,\r\nVirginia, Kentucky, and Missouri, and also the District of Columbia, all\r\nnorth of the Missouri Compromise line. The census returns of 1850 show\r\nthat within these there are eight hundred and sixty-seven thousand two\r\nhundred and seventy-six slaves, being more than one fourth of all the\r\nslaves in the nation.\r\n\r\nIt is not climate, then, that will keep slavery out of these Territories.\r\nIs there anything in the peculiar nature of the country? Missouri adjoins\r\nthese Territories by her entire western boundary, and slavery is already\r\nwithin every one of her western counties. I have even heard it said that\r\nthere are more slaves in proportion to whites in the northwestern county\r\nof Missouri than within any other county in the State. Slavery pressed\r\nentirely up to the old western boundary of the State, and when rather\r\nrecently a part of that boundary at the northwest was moved out a little\r\nfarther west, slavery followed on quite up to the new line. Now, when the\r\nrestriction is removed, what is to prevent it from going still farther?\r\nClimate will not, no peculiarity of the country will, nothing in nature\r\nwill. Will the disposition of the people prevent it? Those nearest the\r\nscene are all in favor of the extension. The Yankees who are opposed to it\r\nmay be most flumerous; but, in military phrase, the battlefield is too far\r\nfrom their base of operations.\r\n\r\nBut it is said there now is no law in Nebraska on the subject of slavery,\r\nand that, in such case, taking a slave there operates his freedom. That is\r\ngood book-law, but it is not the rule of actual practice. Wherever slavery\r\nis it has been first introduced without law. The oldest laws we find\r\nconcerning it are not laws introducing it, but regulating it as an already\r\nexisting thing. A white man takes his slave to Nebraska now. Who will\r\ninform the negro that he is free? Who will take him before court to test\r\nthe question of his freedom? In ignorance of his legal emancipation he is\r\nkept chopping, splitting, and plowing. Others are brought, and move on in\r\nthe same track. At last, if ever the time for voting comes on the question\r\nof slavery the institution already, in fact, exists in the country, and\r\ncannot well be removed. The fact of its presence, and the difficulty of\r\nits removal, will carry the vote in its favor. Keep it out until a vote is\r\ntaken, and a vote in favor of it cannot be got in any population of forty\r\nthousand on earth, who have been drawn together by the ordinary motives of\r\nemigration and settlement. To get slaves into the Territory simultaneously\r\nwith the whites in the incipient stages of settlement is the precise stake\r\nplayed for and won in this Nebraska measure.\r\n\r\nThe question is asked us: \"If slaves will go in notwithstanding the\r\ngeneral principle of law liberates them, why would they not equally go in\r\nagainst positive statute law--go in, even if the Missouri restriction were\r\nmaintained!\" I answer, because it takes a much bolder man to venture\r\nin with his property in the latter case than in the former; because the\r\npositive Congressional enactment is known to and respected by all, or\r\nnearly all, whereas the negative principle that no law is free law is not\r\nmuch known except among lawyers. We have some experience of this practical\r\ndifference. In spite of the Ordinance of '87, a few negroes were brought\r\ninto Illinois, and held in a state of quasi-slavery, not enough, however,\r\nto carry a vote of the people in favor of the institution when they came\r\nto form a constitution. But into the adjoining Missouri country, where\r\nthere was no Ordinance of '87,--was no restriction,--they were carried\r\nten times, nay, a hundred times, as fast, and actually made a slave State.\r\nThis is fact-naked fact.\r\n\r\nAnother lullaby argument is that taking slaves to new countries does not\r\nincrease their number, does not make any one slave who would otherwise\r\nbe free. There is some truth in this, and I am glad of it; but it is not\r\nwholly true. The African slave trade is not yet effectually suppressed;\r\nand, if we make a reasonable deduction for the white people among us who\r\nare foreigners and the descendants of foreigners arriving here since 1808,\r\nwe shall find the increase of the black population outrunning that of the\r\nwhite to an extent unaccountable, except by supposing that some of them,\r\ntoo, have been coming from Africa. If this be so, the opening of new\r\ncountries to the institution increases the demand for and augments the\r\nprice of slaves, and so does, in fact, make slaves of freemen, by causing\r\nthem to be brought from Africa and sold into bondage.\r\n\r\nBut however this may be, we know the opening of new countries to slavery\r\ntends to the perpetuation of the institution, and so does keep men in\r\nslavery who would otherwise be free. This result we do not feel like\r\nfavoring, and we are under no legal obligation to suppress our feelings in\r\nthis respect.\r\n\r\nEqual justice to the South, it is said, requires us to consent to the\r\nextension of slavery to new countries. That is to say, inasmuch as you do\r\nnot object to my taking my hog to Nebraska, therefore I must not object\r\nto your taking your slave. Now, I admit that this is perfectly logical\r\nif there is no difference between hogs and negroes. But while you thus\r\nrequire me to deny the humanity of the negro, I wish to ask whether you of\r\nthe South, yourselves, have ever been willing to do as much? It is kindly\r\nprovided that of all those who come into the world only a small percentage\r\nare natural tyrants. That percentage is no larger in the slave States\r\nthan in the free. The great majority South, as well as North, have human\r\nsympathies, of which they can no more divest themselves than they can of\r\ntheir sensibility to physical pain. These sympathies in the bosoms of\r\nthe Southern people manifest, in many ways, their sense of the wrong of\r\nslavery, and their consciousness that, after all, there is humanity in the\r\nnegro. If they deny this, let me address them a few plain questions. In\r\n1820 you (the South) joined the North, almost unanimously, in declaring\r\nthe African slave trade piracy, and in annexing to it the punishment of\r\ndeath. Why did you do this? If you did not feel that it was wrong, why did\r\nyou join in providing that men should be hung for it? The practice was no\r\nmore than bringing wild negroes from Africa to such as would buy them.\r\nBut you never thought of hanging men for catching and selling wild horses,\r\nwild buffaloes, or wild bears.\r\n\r\nAgain, you have among you a sneaking individual of the class of native\r\ntyrants known as the \"slavedealer.\" He watches your necessities, and\r\ncrawls up to buy your slave, at a speculating price. If you cannot help\r\nit, you sell to him; but if you can help it, you drive him from your door.\r\nYou despise him utterly. You do not recognize him as a friend, or even\r\nas an honest man. Your children must not play with his; they may rollick\r\nfreely with the little negroes, but not with the slave-dealer's children.\r\nIf you are obliged to deal with him, you try to get through the job\r\nwithout so much as touching him. It is common with you to join hands\r\nwith the men you meet, but with the slave-dealer you avoid the\r\nceremony--instinctively shrinking from the snaky contact. If he grows rich\r\nand retires from business, you still remember him, and still keep up the\r\nban of non-intercourse upon him and his family. Now, why is this? You do\r\nnot so treat the man who deals in corn, cotton, or tobacco.\r\n\r\nAnd yet again: There are in the United States and Territories, including\r\nthe District of Columbia, 433,643 free blacks. At five hundred dollars per\r\nhead they are worth over two hundred millions of dollars. How comes this\r\nvast amount of property to be running about without owners? We do not see\r\nfree horses or free cattle running at large. How is this? All these free\r\nblacks are the descendants of slaves, or have been slaves themselves; and\r\nthey would be slaves now but for something which has operated on their\r\nwhite owners, inducing them at vast pecuniary sacrifice to liberate them.\r\nWhat is that something? Is there any mistaking it? In all these cases it\r\nis your sense of justice and human sympathy continually telling you that\r\nthe poor negro has some natural right to himself--that those who deny it\r\nand make mere merchandise of him deserve kickings, contempt, and death.\r\n\r\nAnd now why will you ask us to deny the humanity of the slave, and\r\nestimate him as only the equal of the hog? Why ask us to do what you will\r\nnot do yourselves? Why ask us to do for nothing what two hundred millions\r\nof dollars could not induce you to do?\r\n\r\nBut one great argument in support of the repeal of the Missouri Compromise\r\nis still to come. That argument is \"the sacred right of self-government.\"\r\nIt seems our distinguished Senator has found great difficulty in getting\r\nhis antagonists, even in the Senate, to meet him fairly on this argument.\r\nSome poet has said:\r\n\r\n\"Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.\"\r\n\r\nAt the hazard of being thought one of the fools of this quotation, I\r\nmeet that argument--I rush in--I take that bull by the horns. I trust I\r\nunderstand and truly estimate the right of self-government. My faith in\r\nthe proposition that each man should do precisely as he pleases with\r\nall which is exclusively his own lies at the foundation of the sense of\r\njustice there is in me. I extend the principle to communities of men as\r\nwell as to individuals. I so extend it because it is politically wise, as\r\nwell as naturally just; politically wise in saving us from broils about\r\nmatters which do not concern us. Here, or at Washington, I would not\r\ntrouble myself with the oyster laws of Virginia, or the cranberry laws\r\nof Indiana. The doctrine of self-government is right,--absolutely and\r\neternally right,--but it has no just application as here attempted. Or\r\nperhaps I should rather say that whether it has such application depends\r\nupon whether a negro is or is not a man. If he is not a man, in that case\r\nhe who is a man may as a matter of self-government do just what he pleases\r\nwith him. But if the negro is a man, is it not to that extent a total\r\ndestruction of self-government to say that he too shall not govern\r\nhimself? When the white man governs himself, that is self-government; but\r\nwhen he governs himself and also governs another man, that is more than\r\nself-government--that is despotism. If the negro is a man, why, then, my\r\nancient faith teaches me that \"all men are created equal,\" and that there\r\ncan be no moral right in connection with one man's making a slave of\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nJudge Douglas frequently, with bitter irony and sarcasm, paraphrases\r\nour argument by saying: \"The white people of Nebraska are good enough to\r\ngovern themselves, but they are not good enough to govern a few miserable\r\nnegroes!\"\r\n\r\nWell, I doubt not that the people of Nebraska are and will continue to\r\nbe as good as the average of people elsewhere. I do not say the contrary.\r\nWhat I do say is that no man is good enough to govern another man\r\nwithout that other's consent. I say this is the leading principle, the\r\nsheet-anchor of American republicanism. Our Declaration of Independence\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"We hold these truths to be self-evident: That all men are created equal;\r\nthat they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights;\r\nthat among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to\r\nsecure these rights, governments are instituted among men, DERIVING THEIR\r\nJUST POWERS PROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED.\"\r\n\r\nI have quoted so much at this time merely to show that, according to our\r\nancient faith, the just powers of government are derived from the consent\r\nof the governed. Now the relation of master and slave is pro tanto a total\r\nviolation of this principle. The master not only governs the slave without\r\nhis consent, but he governs him by a set of rules altogether different\r\nfrom those which he prescribes for himself. Allow all the governed\r\nan equal voice in the government, and that, and that only, is\r\nself-government.\r\n\r\nLet it not be said that I am contending for the establishment of political\r\nand social equality between the whites and blacks. I have already said the\r\ncontrary. I am not combating the argument of necessity, arising from the\r\nfact that the blacks are already among us; but I am combating what is set\r\nup as moral argument for allowing them to be taken where they have never\r\nyet been--arguing against the extension of a bad thing, which, where it\r\nalready exists, we must of necessity manage as we best can.\r\n\r\nIn support of his application of the doctrine of self-government, Senator\r\nDouglas has sought to bring to his aid the opinions and examples of our\r\nRevolutionary fathers. I am glad he has done this. I love the sentiments\r\nof those old-time men, and shall be most happy to abide by their opinions.\r\nHe shows us that when it was in contemplation for the colonies to break\r\noff from Great Britain, and set up a new government for themselves,\r\nseveral of the States instructed their delegates to go for the measure,\r\nprovided each State should be allowed to regulate its domestic concerns in\r\nits own way. I do not quote; but this in substance. This was right; I see\r\nnothing objectionable in it. I also think it probable that it had some\r\nreference to the existence of slavery among them. I will not deny that\r\nit had. But had it any reference to the carrying of slavery into new\r\ncountries? That is the question, and we will let the fathers themselves\r\nanswer it.\r\n\r\nThis same generation of men, and mostly the same individuals of the\r\ngeneration who declared this principle, who declared independence,\r\nwho fought the war of the Revolution through, who afterward made the\r\nConstitution under which we still live--these same men passed the\r\nOrdinance of '87, declaring that slavery should never go to the Northwest\r\nTerritory.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt Judge Douglas thinks they were very inconsistent in this.\r\nIt is a question of discrimination between them and him. But there is\r\nnot an inch of ground left for his claiming that their opinions, their\r\nexample, their authority, are on his side in the controversy.\r\n\r\nAgain, is not Nebraska, while a Territory, a part of us? Do we not own the\r\ncountry? And if we surrender the control of it, do we not surrender the\r\nright of self-government? It is part of ourselves. If you say we shall not\r\ncontrol it, because it is only part, the same is true of every other part;\r\nand when all the parts are gone, what has become of the whole? What\r\nis then left of us? What use for the General Government, when there is\r\nnothing left for it to govern?\r\n\r\nBut you say this question should be left to the people of Nebraska,\r\nbecause they are more particularly interested. If this be the rule, you\r\nmust leave it to each individual to say for himself whether he will have\r\nslaves. What better moral right have thirty-one citizens of Nebraska to\r\nsay that the thirty-second shall not hold slaves than the people of\r\nthe thirty-one States have to say that slavery shall not go into the\r\nthirty-second State at all?\r\n\r\nBut if it is a sacred right for the people of Nebraska to take and hold\r\nslaves there, it is equally their sacred right to buy them where they can\r\nbuy them cheapest; and that, undoubtedly, will be on the coast of Africa,\r\nprovided you will consent not to hang them for going there to buy\r\nthem. You must remove this restriction, too, from the sacred right of\r\nself-government. I am aware you say that taking slaves from the States to\r\nNebraska does not make slaves of freemen; but the African slave-trader can\r\nsay just as much. He does not catch free negroes and bring them here.\r\nHe finds them already slaves in the hands of their black captors, and he\r\nhonestly buys them at the rate of a red cotton handkerchief a head.\r\nThis is very cheap, and it is a great abridgment of the sacred right of\r\nself-government to hang men for engaging in this profitable trade.\r\n\r\nAnother important objection to this application of the right of\r\nself-government is that it enables the first few to deprive the succeeding\r\nmany of a free exercise of the right of self-government. The first few\r\nmay get slavery in, and the subsequent many cannot easily get it out. How\r\ncommon is the remark now in the slave States, \"If we were only clear\r\nof our slaves, how much better it would be for us.\" They are actually\r\ndeprived of the privilege of governing themselves as they would, by the\r\naction of a very few in the beginning. The same thing was true of the\r\nwhole nation at the time our Constitution was formed.\r\n\r\nWhether slavery shall go into Nebraska, or other new Territories, is not\r\na matter of exclusive concern to the people who may go there. The whole\r\nnation is interested that the best use shall be made of these Territories.\r\nWe want them for homes of free white people. This they cannot be, to any\r\nconsiderable extent, if slavery shall be planted within them. Slave States\r\nare places for poor white people to remove from, not to remove to. New\r\nfree States are the places for poor people to go to, and better their\r\ncondition. For this use the nation needs these Territories.\r\n\r\nStill further: there are constitutional relations between the slave\r\nand free States which are degrading to the latter. We are under legal\r\nobligations to catch and return their runaway slaves to them: a sort\r\nof dirty, disagreeable job, which, I believe, as a general rule, the\r\nslaveholders will not perform for one another. Then again, in the control\r\nof the government--the management of the partnership affairs--they have\r\ngreatly the advantage of us. By the Constitution each State has two\r\nsenators, each has a number of representatives in proportion to the number\r\nof its people, and each has a number of Presidential electors equal to\r\nthe whole number of its senators and representatives together. But in\r\nascertaining the number of the people for this purpose, five slaves are\r\ncounted as being equal to three whites. The slaves do not vote; they are\r\nonly counted and so used as to swell the influence of the white people's\r\nvotes. The practical effect of this is more aptly shown by a comparison\r\nof the States of South Carolina and Maine. South Carolina has six\r\nrepresentatives, and so has Maine; South Carolina has eight Presidential\r\nelectors, and so has Maine. This is precise equality so far; and of course\r\nthey are equal in senators, each having two. Thus in the control of the\r\ngovernment the two States are equals precisely. But how are they in the\r\nnumber of their white people? Maine has 581,813, while South Carolina has\r\n274,567; Maine has twice as many as South Carolina, and 32,679 over. Thus,\r\neach white man in South Carolina is more than the double of any man in\r\nMaine. This is all because South Carolina, besides her free people, has\r\n384,984 slaves. The South Carolinian has precisely the same advantage over\r\nthe white man in every other free State as well as in Maine. He is more\r\nthan the double of any one of us in this crowd. The same advantage, but\r\nnot to the same extent, is held by all the citizens of the slave States\r\nover those of the free; and it is an absolute truth, without an exception,\r\nthat there is no voter in any slave State but who has more legal power in\r\nthe government than any voter in any free State. There is no instance\r\nof exact equality; and the disadvantage is against us the whole chapter\r\nthrough. This principle, in the aggregate, gives the slave States in the\r\npresent Congress twenty additional representatives, being seven more than\r\nthe whole majority by which they passed the Nebraska Bill.\r\n\r\nNow all this is manifestly unfair; yet I do not mention it to complain of\r\nit, in so far as it is already settled. It is in the Constitution, and I\r\ndo not for that cause, or any other cause, propose to destroy, or alter,\r\nor disregard the Constitution. I stand to it, fairly, fully, and firmly.\r\n\r\nBut when I am told I must leave it altogether to other people to say\r\nwhether new partners are to be bred up and brought into the firm, on\r\nthe same degrading terms against me, I respectfully demur. I insist that\r\nwhether I shall be a whole man or only the half of one, in comparison with\r\nothers is a question in which I am somewhat concerned, and one which no\r\nother man can have a sacred right of deciding for me. If I am wrong in\r\nthis, if it really be a sacred right of self-government in the man who\r\nshall go to Nebraska to decide whether he will be the equal of me or the\r\ndouble of me, then, after he shall have exercised that right, and thereby\r\nshall have reduced me to a still smaller fraction of a man than I already\r\nam, I should like for some gentleman, deeply skilled in the mysteries of\r\nsacred rights, to provide himself with a microscope, and peep about, and\r\nfind out, if he can, what has become of my sacred rights. They will surely\r\nbe too small for detection with the naked eye.\r\n\r\nFinally, I insist that if there is anything which it is the duty of the\r\nwhole people to never intrust to any hands but their own, that thing is\r\nthe preservation and perpetuity of their own liberties and institutions.\r\nAnd if they shall think as I do, that the extension of slavery endangers\r\nthem more than any or all other causes, how recreant to themselves if\r\nthey submit The question, and with it the fate of their country, to a mere\r\nhandful of men bent only on seif-interest. If this question of slavery\r\nextension were an insignificant one, one having no power to do harm--it\r\nmight be shuffled aside in this way; and being, as it is, the great\r\nBehemoth of danger, shall the strong grip of the nation be loosened upon\r\nhim, to intrust him to the hands of such feeble keepers?\r\n\r\nI have done with this mighty argument of self-government. Go, sacred\r\nthing! Go in peace.\r\n\r\nBut Nebraska is urged as a great Union-saving measure. Well, I too go for\r\nsaving the Union. Much as I hate slavery, I would consent to the extension\r\nof it rather than see the Union dissolved, just as I would consent to any\r\ngreat evil to avoid a greater one. But when I go to Union-saving, I must\r\nbelieve, at least, that the means I employ have some adaptation to the\r\nend. To my mind, Nebraska has no such adaptation.\r\n\r\n\"It hath no relish of salvation in it.\"\r\n\r\nIt is an aggravation, rather, of the only one thing which ever endangers\r\nthe Union. When it came upon us, all was peace and quiet. The nation was\r\nlooking to the forming of new bends of union, and a long course of peace\r\nand prosperity seemed to lie before us. In the whole range of possibility,\r\nthere scarcely appears to me to have been anything out of which the\r\nslavery agitation could have been revived, except the very project of\r\nrepealing the Missouri Compromise. Every inch of territory we owned\r\nalready had a definite settlement of the slavery question, by which all\r\nparties were pledged to abide. Indeed, there was no uninhabited country on\r\nthe continent which we could acquire, if we except some extreme northern\r\nregions which are wholly out of the question.\r\n\r\nIn this state of affairs the Genius of Discord himself could scarcely have\r\ninvented a way of again setting us by the ears but by turning back and\r\ndestroying the peace measures of the past. The counsels of that Genius\r\nseem to have prevailed. The Missouri Compromise was repealed; and here\r\nwe are in the midst of a new slavery agitation, such, I think, as we have\r\nnever seen before. Who is responsible for this? Is it those who resist\r\nthe measure, or those who causelessly brought it forward, and pressed it\r\nthrough, having reason to know, and in fact knowing, it must and would be\r\nso resisted? It could not but be expected by its author that it would be\r\nlooked upon as a measure for the extension of slavery, aggravated by a\r\ngross breach of faith.\r\n\r\nArgue as you will and long as you will, this is the naked front and aspect\r\nof the measure. And in this aspect it could not but produce agitation.\r\nSlavery is founded in the selfishness of man's nature--opposition to it in\r\nhis love of justice. These principles are at eternal antagonism, and\r\nwhen brought into collision so fiercely as slavery extension brings them,\r\nshocks and throes and convulsions must ceaselessly follow. Repeal the\r\nMissouri Compromise, repeal all compromises, repeal the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, repeal all past history, you still cannot repeal human\r\nnature. It still will be the abundance of man's heart that slavery\r\nextension is wrong, and out of the abundance of his heart his mouth will\r\ncontinue to speak.\r\n\r\nThe structure, too, of the Nebraska Bill is very peculiar. The people are\r\nto decide the question of slavery for themselves; but when they are to\r\ndecide, or how they are to decide, or whether, when the question is\r\nonce decided, it is to remain so or is to be subject to an indefinite\r\nsuccession of new trials, the law does not say. Is it to be decided by the\r\nfirst dozen settlers who arrive there, or is it to await the arrival of\r\na hundred? Is it to be decided by a vote of the people or a vote of the\r\nLegislature, or, indeed, by a vote of any sort? To these questions the law\r\ngives no answer. There is a mystery about this; for when a member proposed\r\nto give the Legislature express authority to exclude slavery, it was\r\nhooted down by the friends of the bill. This fact is worth remembering.\r\nSome Yankees in the East are sending emigrants to Nebraska to exclude\r\nslavery from it; and, so far as I can judge, they expect the question to\r\nbe decided by voting in some way or other. But the Missourians are awake,\r\ntoo. They are within a stone's-throw of the contested ground. They hold\r\nmeetings and pass resolutions, in which not the slightest allusion to\r\nvoting is made. They resolve that slavery already exists in the Territory;\r\nthat more shall go there; that they, remaining in Missouri, will protect\r\nit, and that abolitionists shall be hung or driven away. Through all this\r\nbowie knives and six-shooters are seen plainly enough, but never a glimpse\r\nof the ballot-box.\r\n\r\nAnd, really, what is the result of all this? Each party within having\r\nnumerous and determined backers without, is it not probable that the\r\ncontest will come to blows and bloodshed? Could there be a more apt\r\ninvention to bring about collision and violence on the slavery question\r\nthan this Nebraska project is? I do not charge or believe that such was\r\nintended by Congress; but if they had literally formed a ring and placed\r\nchampions within it to fight out the controversy, the fight could be no\r\nmore likely to come off than it is. And if this fight should begin, is it\r\nlikely to take a very peaceful, Union-saving turn? Will not the first drop\r\nof blood so shed be the real knell of the Union?\r\n\r\nThe Missouri Compromise ought to be restored. For the sake of the Union,\r\nit ought to be restored. We ought to elect a House of Representatives\r\nwhich will vote its restoration. If by any means we omit to do this, what\r\nfollows? Slavery may or may not be established in Nebraska. But whether\r\nit be or not, we shall have repudiated--discarded from the councils of the\r\nnation--the spirit of compromise; for who, after this, will ever trust in\r\na national compromise? The spirit of mutual concession--that spirit which\r\nfirst gave us the Constitution, and which has thrice saved the Union--we\r\nshall have strangled and cast from us forever. And what shall we have\r\nin lieu of it? The South flushed with triumph and tempted to excess;\r\nthe North, betrayed as they believe, brooding on wrong and burning for\r\nrevenge. One side will provoke, the other resent. The one will taunt,\r\nthe other defy; one aggresses, the other retaliates. Already a few in\r\nthe North defy all constitutional restraints, resist the execution of\r\nthe Fugitive Slave law, and even menace the institution of slavery in\r\nthe States where it exists. Already a few in the South claim the\r\nconstitutional right to take and to hold slaves in the free States, demand\r\nthe revival of the slave trade, and demand a treaty with Great Britain by\r\nwhich fugitive slaves may be reclaimed from Canada. As yet they are but\r\nfew on either side. It is a grave question for lovers of the union whether\r\nthe final destruction of the Missouri Compromise, and with it the spirit\r\nof all compromise, will or will not embolden and embitter each of these,\r\nand fatally increase the number of both.\r\n\r\nBut restore the compromise, and what then? We thereby restore the national\r\nfaith, the national confidence, the national feeling of brotherhood. We\r\nthereby reinstate the spirit of concession and compromise, that spirit\r\nwhich has never failed us in past perils, and which may be safely trusted\r\nfor all the future. The South ought to join in doing this. The peace of\r\nthe nation is as dear to them as to us. In memories of the past and hopes\r\nof the future, they share as largely as we. It would be on their part a\r\ngreat act--great in its spirit, and great in its effect. It would be worth\r\nto the nation a hundred years purchase of peace and prosperity. And what\r\nof sacrifice would they make? They only surrender to us what they gave\r\nus for a consideration long, long ago; what they have not now asked for,\r\nstruggled or cared for; what has been thrust upon them, not less to their\r\nastonishment than to ours.\r\n\r\nBut it is said we cannot restore it; that though we elect every member of\r\nthe lower House, the Senate is still against us. It is quite true that of\r\nthe senators who passed the Nebraska Bill a majority of the whole Senate\r\nwill retain their seats in spite of the elections of this and the next\r\nyear. But if at these elections their several constituencies shall clearly\r\nexpress their will against Nebraska, will these senators disregard their\r\nwill? Will they neither obey nor make room for those who will?\r\n\r\nBut even if we fail to technically restore the compromise, it is still a\r\ngreat point to carry a popular vote in favor of the restoration. The\r\nmoral weight of such a vote cannot be estimated too highly. The authors\r\nof Nebraska are not at all satisfied with the destruction of the\r\ncompromise--an indorsement of this principle they proclaim to be the\r\ngreat object. With them, Nebraska alone is a small matter--to establish a\r\nprinciple for future use is what they particularly desire.\r\n\r\nThe future use is to be the planting of slavery wherever in the wide world\r\nlocal and unorganized opposition cannot prevent it. Now, if you wish to\r\ngive them this indorsement, if you wish to establish this principle, do\r\nso. I shall regret it, but it is your right. On the contrary, if you are\r\nopposed to the principle,--intend to give it no such indorsement, let no\r\nwheedling, no sophistry, divert you from throwing a direct vote against\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSome men, mostly Whigs, who condemn the repeal of the Missouri Compromise,\r\nnevertheless hesitate to go for its restoration, lest they be thrown in\r\ncompany with the abolitionists. Will they allow me, as an old Whig, to\r\ntell them, good-humoredly, that I think this is very silly? Stand with\r\nanybody that stands right. Stand with him while he is right, and part\r\nwith him when he goes wrong. Stand with the abolitionist in restoring the\r\nMissouri Compromise, and stand against him when he attempts to repeal\r\nthe Fugitive Slave law. In the latter case you stand with the Southern\r\ndisunionist. What of that? You are still right. In both cases you are\r\nright. In both cases you oppose the dangerous extremes. In both you stand\r\non middle ground, and hold the ship level and steady. In both you are\r\nnational, and nothing less than national. This is the good old Whig\r\nground. To desert such ground because of any company is to be less than a\r\nWhig--less than a man--less than an American.\r\n\r\nI particularly object to the new position which the avowed principle of\r\nthis Nebraska law gives to slavery in the body politic. I object to it\r\nbecause it assumes that there can be moral right in the enslaving of\r\none man by another. I object to it as a dangerous dalliance for a free\r\npeople--a sad evidence that, feeling prosperity, we forget right; that\r\nliberty, as a principle, we have ceased to revere. I object to it because\r\nthe fathers of the republic eschewed and rejected it. The argument of\r\n\"necessity\" was the only argument they ever admitted in favor of slavery;\r\nand so far, and so far only, as it carried them did they ever go. They\r\nfound the institution existing among us, which they could not help,\r\nand they cast blame upon the British king for having permitted its\r\nintroduction.\r\n\r\nThe royally appointed Governor of Georgia in the early 1700's was\r\nthreatened by the King with removal if he continued to oppose slavery in\r\nhis colony--at that time the King of England made a small profit on every\r\nslave imported to the colonies. The later British criticism of the United\r\nStates for not eradicating slavery in the early 1800's, combined with\r\ntheir tacit support of the 'Confederacy' during the Civil War is a prime\r\nexample of the irony and hypocrisy of politics: that self-interest will\r\never overpower right.\r\n\r\nBefore the Constitution they prohibited its introduction into the\r\nNorthwestern Territory, the only country we owned then free from it. At\r\nthe framing and adoption of the Constitution, they forbore to so much\r\nas mention the word \"slave\" or \"slavery\" in the whole instrument. In\r\nthe provision for the recovery of fugitives, the slave is spoken of as a\r\n\"person held to service or labor.\" In that prohibiting the abolition of\r\nthe African slave trade for twenty years, that trade is spoken of as \"the\r\nmigration or importation of such persons as any of the States now existing\r\nshall think proper to admit,\" etc. These are the only provisions alluding\r\nto slavery. Thus the thing is hid away in the Constitution, just as an\r\nafflicted man hides away a wen or cancer which he dares not cut out at\r\nonce, lest he bleed to death,--with the promise, nevertheless, that the\r\ncutting may begin at a certain time. Less than this our fathers could not\r\ndo, and more they would not do. Necessity drove them so far, and farther\r\nthey would not go. But this is not all. The earliest Congress under the\r\nConstitution took the same view of slavery. They hedged and hemmed it in\r\nto the narrowest limits of necessity.\r\n\r\nIn 1794 they prohibited an outgoing slave trade--that is, the taking\r\nof slaves from the United States to sell. In 1798 they prohibited the\r\nbringing of slaves from Africa into the Mississippi Territory, this\r\nTerritory then comprising what are now the States of Mississippi and\r\nAlabama. This was ten years before they had the authority to do the same\r\nthing as to the States existing at the adoption of the Constitution. In\r\n1800 they prohibited American citizens from trading in slaves between\r\nforeign countries, as, for instance, from Africa to Brazil. In 1803 they\r\npassed a law in aid of one or two slave-State laws in restraint of the\r\ninternal slave trade. In 1807, in apparent hot haste, they passed the law,\r\nnearly a year in advance,--to take effect the first day of 1808, the very\r\nfirst day the Constitution would permit, prohibiting the African slave\r\ntrade by heavy pecuniary and corporal penalties. In 1820, finding these\r\nprovisions ineffectual, they declared the slave trade piracy, and annexed\r\nto it the extreme penalty of death. While all this was passing in the\r\nGeneral Government, five or six of the original slave States had adopted\r\nsystems of gradual emancipation, by which the institution was rapidly\r\nbecoming extinct within their limits. Thus we see that the plain,\r\nunmistakable spirit of that age toward slavery was hostility to the\r\nprinciple and toleration only by necessity.\r\n\r\nBut now it is to be transformed into a \"sacred right.\" Nebraska brings it\r\nforth, places it on the highroad to extension and perpetuity, and with a\r\npat on its back says to it, \"Go, and God speed you.\" Henceforth it is\r\nto be the chief jewel of the nation the very figure-head of the ship of\r\nstate. Little by little, but steadily as man's march to the grave, we have\r\nbeen giving up the old for the new faith. Near eighty years ago we began\r\nby declaring that all men are created equal; but now from that beginning\r\nwe have run down to the other declaration, that for some men to enslave\r\nothers is a \"sacred right of self-government.\" These principles cannot\r\nstand together. They are as opposite as God and Mammon; and who ever holds\r\nto the one must despise the other. When Pettit, in connection with his\r\nsupport of the Nebraska Bill, called the Declaration of Independence \"a\r\nself-evident lie,\" he only did what consistency and candor require all\r\nother Nebraska men to do. Of the forty-odd Nebraska senators who sat\r\npresent and heard him, no one rebuked him. Nor am I apprised that any\r\nNebraska newspaper, or any Nebraska orator, in the whole nation has ever\r\nyet rebuked him. If this had been said among Marion's men, Southerners\r\nthough they were, what would have become of the man who said it? If this\r\nhad been said to the men who captured Andre, the man who said it would\r\nprobably have been hung sooner than Andre was. If it had been said in old\r\nIndependence Hall seventy-eight years ago, the very doorkeeper would have\r\nthrottled the man and thrust him into the street. Let no one be\r\ndeceived. The spirit of seventy-six and the spirit of Nebraska are utter\r\nantagonisms; and the former is being rapidly displaced by the latter.\r\n\r\nFellow-countrymen, Americans, South as well as North, shall we make no\r\neffort to arrest this? Already the liberal party throughout the world\r\nexpress the apprehension that \"the one retrograde institution in America\r\nis undermining the principles of progress, and fatally violating the\r\nnoblest political system the world ever saw.\" This is not the taunt of\r\nenemies, but the warning of friends. Is it quite safe to disregard\r\nit--to despise it? Is there no danger to liberty itself in discarding the\r\nearliest practice and first precept of our ancient faith? In our greedy\r\nchase to make profit of the negro, let us beware lest we \"cancel and tear\r\nin pieces\" even the white man's charter of freedom.\r\n\r\nOur republican robe is soiled and trailed in the dust. Let us repurify\r\nit. Let us turn and wash it white in the spirit, if not the blood, of the\r\nRevolution. Let us turn slavery from its claims of \"moral right,\" back\r\nupon its existing legal rights and its arguments of \"necessity.\" Let us\r\nreturn it to the position our fathers gave it, and there let it rest in\r\npeace. Let us readopt the Declaration of Independence, and with it the\r\npractices and policy which harmonize with it. Let North and South, let all\r\nAmericans--let all lovers of liberty everywhere join in the great and good\r\nwork. If we do this, we shall not only have saved the Union, but we shall\r\nhave so saved it as to make and to keep it forever worthy of the saving.\r\nWe shall have so saved it that the succeeding millions of free happy\r\npeople the world over shall rise up and call us blessed to the latest\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nAt Springfield, twelve days ago, where I had spoken substantially as I\r\nhave here, Judge Douglas replied to me; and as he is to reply to me here,\r\nI shall attempt to anticipate him by noticing some of the points he made\r\nthere. He commenced by stating I had assumed all the way through that the\r\nprinciple of the Nebraska Bill would have the effect of extending slavery.\r\nHe denied that this was intended or that this effect would follow.\r\n\r\nI will not reopen the argument upon this point. That such was the\r\nintention the world believed at the start, and will continue to believe.\r\nThis was the countenance of the thing, and both friends and enemies\r\ninstantly recognized it as such. That countenance cannot now be changed by\r\nargument. You can as easily argue the color out of the negro's skin. Like\r\nthe \"bloody hand,\" you may wash it and wash it, the red witness of guilt\r\nstill sticks and stares horribly at you.\r\n\r\nNext he says that Congressional intervention never prevented slavery\r\nanywhere; that it did not prevent it in the Northwestern Territory, nor\r\nin Illinois; that, in fact, Illinois came into the Union as a slave State;\r\nthat the principle of the Nebraska Bill expelled it from Illinois, from\r\nseveral old States, from everywhere.\r\n\r\nNow this is mere quibbling all the way through. If the Ordinance of '87\r\ndid not keep slavery out of the Northwest Territory, how happens it that\r\nthe northwest shore of the Ohio River is entirely free from it, while the\r\nsoutheast shore, less than a mile distant, along nearly the whole length\r\nof the river, is entirely covered with it?\r\n\r\nIf that ordinance did not keep it out of Illinois, what was it that made\r\nthe difference between Illinois and Missouri? They lie side by side, the\r\nMississippi River only dividing them, while their early settlements were\r\nwithin the same latitude. Between 1810 and 1820 the number of slaves in\r\nMissouri increased 7211, while in Illinois in the same ten years they\r\ndecreased 51. This appears by the census returns. During nearly all of\r\nthat ten years both were Territories, not States. During this time the\r\nordinance forbade slavery to go into Illinois, and nothing forbade it to\r\ngo into Missouri. It did go into Missouri, and did not go into Illinois.\r\nThat is the fact. Can any one doubt as to the reason of it? But he says\r\nIllinois came into the Union as a slave State. Silence, perhaps, would\r\nbe the best answer to this flat contradiction of the known history of the\r\ncountry. What are the facts upon which this bold assertion is based? When\r\nwe first acquired the country, as far back as 1787, there were some slaves\r\nwithin it held by the French inhabitants of Kaskaskia. The territorial\r\nlegislation admitted a few negroes from the slave States as indentured\r\nservants. One year after the adoption of the first State constitution,\r\nthe whole number of them was--what do you think? Just one hundred and\r\nseventeen, while the aggregate free population was 55,094,--about four\r\nhundred and seventy to one. Upon this state of facts the people framed\r\ntheir constitution prohibiting the further introduction of slavery, with\r\na sort of guaranty to the owners of the few indentured servants, giving\r\nfreedom to their children to be born thereafter, and making no mention\r\nwhatever of any supposed slave for life. Out of this small matter the\r\nJudge manufactures his argument that Illinois came into the Union as a\r\nslave State. Let the facts be the answer to the argument.\r\n\r\nThe principles of the Nebraska Bill, he says, expelled slavery from\r\nIllinois. The principle of that bill first planted it here--that is, it\r\nfirst came because there was no law to prevent it, first came before we\r\nowned the country; and finding it here, and having the Ordinance of '87 to\r\nprevent its increasing, our people struggled along, and finally got rid of\r\nit as best they could.\r\n\r\nBut the principle of the Nebraska Bill abolished slavery in several of the\r\nold States. Well, it is true that several of the old States, in the last\r\nquarter of the last century, did adopt systems of gradual emancipation by\r\nwhich the institution has finally become extinct within their limits; but\r\nit may or may not be true that the principle of the Nebraska Bill was\r\nthe cause that led to the adoption of these measures. It is now more\r\nthan fifty years since the last of these States adopted its system of\r\nemancipation.\r\n\r\nIf the Nebraska Bill is the real author of the benevolent works, it\r\nis rather deplorable that it has for so long a time ceased working\r\naltogether. Is there not some reason to suspect that it was the principle\r\nof the Revolution, and not the principle of the Nebraska Bill, that led\r\nto emancipation in these old States? Leave it to the people of these old\r\nemancipating States, and I am quite certain they will decide that neither\r\nthat nor any other good thing ever did or ever will come of the Nebraska\r\nBill.\r\n\r\nIn the course of my main argument, Judge Douglas interrupted me to say\r\nthat the principle of the Nebraska Bill was very old; that it originated\r\nwhen God made man, and placed good and evil before him, allowing him to\r\nchoose for himself, being responsible for the choice he should make. At\r\nthe time I thought this was merely playful, and I answered it accordingly.\r\nBut in his reply to me he renewed it as a serious argument. In\r\nseriousness, then, the facts of this proposition are not true as stated.\r\nGod did not place good and evil before man, telling him to make his\r\nchoice. On the contrary, he did tell him there was one tree of the fruit\r\nof which he should not eat, upon pain of certain death. I should scarcely\r\nwish so strong a prohibition against slavery in Nebraska.\r\n\r\nBut this argument strikes me as not a little remarkable in another\r\nparticular--in its strong resemblance to the old argument for the \"divine\r\nright of kings.\" By the latter, the king is to do just as he pleases with\r\nhis white subjects, being responsible to God alone. By the former,\r\nthe white man is to do just as he pleases with his black slaves, being\r\nresponsible to God alone. The two things are precisely alike, and it is\r\nbut natural that they should find similar arguments to sustain them.\r\n\r\nI had argued that the application of the principle of self-government, as\r\ncontended for, would require the revival of the African slave trade; that\r\nno argument could be made in favor of a man's right to take slaves to\r\nNebraska which could not be equally well made in favor of his right\r\nto bring them from the coast of Africa. The Judge replied that the\r\nConstitution requires the suppression of the foreign slave trade, but\r\ndoes not require the prohibition of slavery in the Territories. That is a\r\nmistake in point of fact. The Constitution does not require the action of\r\nCongress in either case, and it does authorize it in both. And so there is\r\nstill no difference between the cases.\r\n\r\nIn regard to what I have said of the advantage the slave States have over\r\nthe free in the matter of representation, the Judge replied that we in\r\nthe free States count five free negroes as five white people, while in\r\nthe slave States they count five slaves as three whites only; and that the\r\nadvantage, at last, was on the side of the free States.\r\n\r\nNow, in the slave States they count free negroes just as we do; and it so\r\nhappens that, besides their slaves, they have as many free negroes as we\r\nhave, and thirty thousand over. Thus, their free negroes more than balance\r\nours; and their advantage over us, in consequence of their slaves, still\r\nremains as I stated it.\r\n\r\nIn reply to my argument that the compromise measures of 1850 were a system\r\nof equivalents, and that the provisions of no one of them could fairly\r\nbe carried to other subjects without its corresponding equivalent being\r\ncarried with it, the Judge denied outright that these measures had any\r\nconnection with or dependence upon each other. This is mere desperation.\r\nIf they had no connection, why are they always spoken of in connection?\r\nWhy has he so spoken of them a thousand times? Why has he constantly\r\ncalled them a series of measures? Why does everybody call them a\r\ncompromise? Why was California kept out of the Union six or seven months,\r\nif it was not because of its connection with the other measures? Webster's\r\nleading definition of the verb \"to compromise\" is \"to adjust and settle\r\na difference, by mutual agreement, with concessions of claims by the\r\nparties.\" This conveys precisely the popular understanding of the word\r\n\"compromise.\"\r\n\r\nWe knew, before the Judge told us, that these measures passed separately,\r\nand in distinct bills, and that no two of them were passed by the votes of\r\nprecisely the same members. But we also know, and so does he know, that\r\nno one of them could have passed both branches of Congress but for the\r\nunderstanding that the others were to pass also. Upon this understanding,\r\neach got votes which it could have got in no other way. It is this fact\r\nwhich gives to the measures their true character; and it is the universal\r\nknowledge of this fact that has given them the name of \"compromises,\" so\r\nexpressive of that true character.\r\n\r\nI had asked: \"If, in carrying the Utah and New Mexico laws to Nebraska,\r\nyou could clear away other objection, how could you leave Nebraska\r\n'perfectly free' to introduce slavery before she forms a constitution,\r\nduring her territorial government, while the Utah and New Mexico laws\r\nonly authorize it when they form constitutions and are admitted into the\r\nUnion?\" To this Judge Douglas answered that the Utah and New Mexico laws\r\nalso authorized it before; and to prove this he read from one of their\r\nlaws, as follows: \"That the legislative power of said Territory shall\r\nextend to all rightful subjects of legislation, consistent with the\r\nConstitution of the United States and the provisions of this act.\"\r\n\r\nNow it is perceived from the reading of this that there is nothing express\r\nupon the subject, but that the authority is sought to be implied merely\r\nfor the general provision of \"all rightful subjects of legislation.\" In\r\nreply to this I insist, as a legal rule of construction, as well as the\r\nplain, popular view of the matter, that the express provision for Utah and\r\nNew Mexico coming in with slavery, if they choose, when they shall form\r\nconstitutions, is an exclusion of all implied authority on the same\r\nsubject; that Congress having the subject distinctly in their minds\r\nwhen they made the express provision, they therein expressed their whole\r\nmeaning on that subject.\r\n\r\nThe Judge rather insinuated that I had found it convenient to forget the\r\nWashington territorial law passed in 1853. This was a division of Oregon,\r\norganizing the northern part as the Territory of Washington. He asserted\r\nthat by this act the Ordinance of '87, theretofore existing in Oregon, was\r\nrepealed; that nearly all the members of Congress voted for it, beginning\r\nin the House of Representatives with Charles Allen of Massachusetts, and\r\nending with Richard Yates of Illinois; and that he could not understand\r\nhow those who now opposed the Nebraska Bill so voted there, unless it was\r\nbecause it was then too soon after both the great political parties had\r\nratified the compromises of 1850, and the ratification therefore was too\r\nfresh to be then repudiated.\r\n\r\nNow I had seen the Washington act before, and I have carefully examined it\r\nsince; and I aver that there is no repeal of the Ordinance of '87, or of\r\nany prohibition of slavery, in it. In express terms, there is absolutely\r\nnothing in the whole law upon the subject--in fact, nothing to lead a\r\nreader to think of the subject. To my judgment it is equally free from\r\neverything from which repeal can be legally implied; but, however this\r\nmay be, are men now to be entrapped by a legal implication, extracted from\r\ncovert language, introduced perhaps for the very purpose of entrapping\r\nthem? I sincerely wish every man could read this law quite through,\r\ncarefully watching every sentence and every line for a repeal of the\r\nOrdinance of '87, or anything equivalent to it.\r\n\r\nAnother point on the Washington act: If it was intended to be modeled\r\nafter the Utah and New Mexico acts, as Judge Douglas insists, why was it\r\nnot inserted in it, as in them, that Washington was to come in with or\r\nwithout slavery as she may choose at the adoption of her constitution?\r\nIt has no such provision in it; and I defy the ingenuity of man to give a\r\nreason for the omission, other than that it was not intended to follow the\r\nUtah and New Mexico laws in regard to the question of slavery.\r\n\r\nThe Washington act not only differs vitally from the Utah and New Mexico\r\nacts, but the Nebraska act differs vitally from both. By the latter\r\nact the people are left \"perfectly free\" to regulate their own domestic\r\nconcerns, etc.; but in all the former, all their laws are to be submitted\r\nto Congress, and if disapproved are to be null. The Washington act goes\r\neven further; it absolutely prohibits the territorial Legislature, by very\r\nstrong and guarded language, from establishing banks or borrowing money on\r\nthe faith of the Territory. Is this the sacred right of self-government\r\nwe hear vaunted so much? No, sir; the Nebraska Bill finds no model in the\r\nacts of '50 or the Washington act. It finds no model in any law from Adam\r\ntill to-day. As Phillips says of Napoleon, the Nebraska act is grand,\r\ngloomy and peculiar, wrapped in the solitude of its own originality,\r\nwithout a model and without a shadow upon the earth.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his reply Senator Douglas remarked in substance that he\r\nhad always considered this government was made for the white people and\r\nnot for the negroes. Why, in point of mere fact, I think so too. But in\r\nthis remark of the Judge there is a significance which I think is the key\r\nto the great mistake (if there is any such mistake) which he has made\r\nin this Nebraska measure. It shows that the Judge has no very vivid\r\nimpression that the negro is human, and consequently has no idea that\r\nthere can be any moral question in legislating about him. In his view the\r\nquestion of whether a new country shall be slave or free is a matter of as\r\nutter indifference as it is whether his neighbor shall plant his farm with\r\ntobacco or stock it with horned cattle. Now, whether this view is right\r\nor wrong, it is very certain that the great mass of mankind take a totally\r\ndifferent view. They consider slavery a great moral wrong, and their\r\nfeeling against it is not evanescent, but eternal. It lies at the very\r\nfoundation of their sense of justice, and it cannot be trifled with. It\r\nis a great and durable element of popular action, and I think no statesman\r\ncan safely disregard it.\r\n\r\nOur Senator also objects that those who oppose him in this matter do not\r\nentirely agree with one another. He reminds me that in my firm adherence\r\nto the constitutional rights of the slave States I differ widely from\r\nothers who are cooperating with me in opposing the Nebraska Bill, and he\r\nsays it is not quite fair to oppose him in this variety of ways. He should\r\nremember that he took us by surprise--astounded us by this measure. We\r\nwere thunderstruck and stunned, and we reeled and fell in utter confusion.\r\nBut we rose, each fighting, grasping whatever he could first reach--a\r\nscythe, a pitchfork, a chopping-ax, or a butcher's cleaver. We struck in\r\nthe direction of the sound, and we were rapidly closing in upon him. He\r\nmust not think to divert us from our purpose by showing us that our drill,\r\nour dress, and our weapons are not entirely perfect and uniform. When the\r\nstorm shall be past he shall find us still Americans, no less devoted to\r\nthe continued union and prosperity of the country than heretofore.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Judge invokes against me the memory of Clay and Webster, They\r\nwere great men, and men of great deeds. But where have I assailed them?\r\nFor what is it that their lifelong enemy shall now make profit by assuming\r\nto defend them against me, their lifelong friend? I go against the repeal\r\nof the Missouri Compromise; did they ever go for it? They went for the\r\nCompromise of 1850; did I ever go against them? They were greatly devoted\r\nto the Union; to the small measure of my ability was I ever less so? Clay\r\nand Webster were dead before this question arose; by what authority shall\r\nour Senator say they would espouse his side of it if alive? Mr. Clay was\r\nthe leading spirit in making the Missouri Compromise; is it very credible\r\nthat if now alive he would take the lead in the breaking of it? The truth\r\nis that some support from Whigs is now a necessity with the Judge, and for\r\nthis it is that the names of Clay and Webster are invoked. His old friends\r\nhave deserted him in such numbers as to leave too few to live by. He\r\ncame to his own, and his own received him not; and lo! he turns unto the\r\nGentiles.\r\n\r\nA word now as to the Judge's desperate assumption that the compromises of\r\n1850 had no connection with one another; that Illinois came into the Union\r\nas a slave State, and some other similar ones. This is no other than a\r\nbold denial of the history of the country. If we do not know that the\r\ncompromises of 1850 were dependent on each other; if we do not know that\r\nIllinois came into the Union as a free State,--we do not know anything.\r\nIf we do not know these things, we do not know that we ever had a\r\nRevolutionary War or such a chief as Washington. To deny these things is\r\nto deny our national axioms,--or dogmas, at least,--and it puts an end to\r\nall argument. If a man will stand up and assert, and repeat and reassert,\r\nthat two and two do not make four, I know nothing in the power of argument\r\nthat can stop him. I think I can answer the Judge so long as he sticks to\r\nthe premises; but when he flies from them, I cannot work any argument into\r\nthe consistency of a mental gag and actually close his mouth with it. In\r\nsuch a case I can only commend him to the seventy thousand answers just in\r\nfrom Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR SENATE SUPPORT\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES HOYT\r\n\r\nCLINTON, De WITT Co., Nov. 10, 1854\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--You used to express a good deal of partiality for me, and if\r\nyou are still so, now is the time. Some friends here are really for me for\r\nthe U.S. Senate, and I should be very grateful if you could make a mark\r\nfor me among your members. Please write me at all events, giving me the\r\nnames, post-offices, and \"political position\" of members round about you.\r\nDirect to Springfield.\r\n\r\nLet this be confidential.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO T. J. HENDERSON.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD,\r\n\r\nNovember 27, 1854 T. J. HENDERSON, ESQ.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--It has come round that a whig may, by possibility, be\r\nelected to the United States Senate, and I want the chance of being the\r\nman. You are a member of the Legislature, and have a vote to give. Think\r\nit over, and see whether you can do better than to go for me.\r\n\r\nWrite me, at all events; and let this be confidential.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. GILLESPIE.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Dec. 1, 1854.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--I have really got it into my head to try to be United States\r\nSenator, and, if I could have your support, my chances would be reasonably\r\ngood. But I know, and acknowledge, that you have as just claims to the\r\nplace as I have; and therefore I cannot ask you to yield to me, if you are\r\nthinking of becoming a candidate, yourself. If, however, you are not, then\r\nI should like to be remembered affectionately by you; and also to have you\r\nmake a mark for me with the Anti-Nebraska members down your way.\r\n\r\nIf you know, and have no objection to tell, let me know whether Trumbull\r\nintends to make a push. If he does, I suppose the two men in St. Clair,\r\nand one, or both, in Madison, will be for him. We have the Legislature,\r\nclearly enough, on joint ballot, but the Senate is very close, and Cullom\r\ntold me to-day that the Nebraska men will stave off the election, if they\r\ncan. Even if we get into joint vote, we shall have difficulty to unite our\r\nforces. Please write me, and let this be confidential.\r\n\r\nYour friend, as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL REFERENCES\r\n\r\nTO JUSTICE MCLEAN.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., December 6, 1854.\r\n\r\nSIR:--I understand it is in contemplation to displace the present clerk\r\nand appoint a new one for the Circuit and District Courts of Illinois. I\r\nam very friendly to the present incumbent, and, both for his own sake and\r\nthat of his family, I wish him to be retained so long as it is possible\r\nfor the court to do so.\r\n\r\nIn the contingency of his removal, however, I have recommended William\r\nButler as his successor, and I do not wish what I write now to be taken as\r\nany abatement of that recommendation.\r\n\r\nWilliam J. Black is also an applicant for the appointment, and I write\r\nthis at the solicitation of his friends to say that he is every way worthy\r\nof the office, and that I doubt not the conferring it upon him will give\r\ngreat satisfaction.\r\n\r\nYour ob't servant,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO T. J. HENDERSON.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, December 15. 1854\r\n\r\nHON. T. J. HENDERSON.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Yours of the 11th was received last night, and for which I\r\nthank you. Of course I prefer myself to all others; yet it is neither in\r\nmy heart nor my conscience to say I am any better man than Mr. Williams.\r\nWe shall have a terrible struggle with our adversaries. They are desperate\r\nand bent on desperate deeds. I accidentally learned of one of the leaders\r\nhere writing to a member south of here, in about the following language:\r\n\r\nWe are beaten. They have a clean majority of at least nine, on joint\r\nballot. They outnumber us, but we must outmanage them. Douglas must be\r\nsustained. We must elect the Speaker; and we must elect a Nebraska United\r\nStates Senator, or \"elect none at all.\" Similar letters, no doubt, are\r\nwritten to every Nebraska member. Be considering how we can best meet, and\r\nfoil, and beat them. I send you, by mail, a copy of my Peoria speech. You\r\nmay have seen it before, or you may not think it worth seeing now.\r\n\r\nDo not speak of the Nebraska letter mentioned above; I do not wish it to\r\nbecome public, that I received such information.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1855\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOSS OF PRIMARY FOR SENATOR\r\n\r\nTO E. B. WASHBURNE.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, February 9, 1855 MY DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\nI began with 44 votes, Shields 41, and Trumbull 5,--yet Trumbull was\r\nelected. In fact 47 different members voted for me,--getting three new\r\nones on the second ballot, and losing four old ones. How came my 47\r\nto yield to Trumbull's 5? It was Governor Matteson's work. He has been\r\nsecretly a candidate ever since (before, even) the fall election.\r\n\r\nAll the members round about the canal were Anti-Nebraska, but were\r\nnevertheless nearly all Democrats and old personal friends of his. His\r\nplan was to privately impress them with the belief that he was as good\r\nAnti-Nebraska as any one else--at least could be secured to be so by\r\ninstructions, which could be easily passed.\r\n\r\nThe Nebraska men, of course, were not for Matteson; but when they found\r\nthey could elect no avowed Nebraska man, they tardily determined to let\r\nhim get whomever of our men he could, by whatever means he could, and ask\r\nhim no questions.\r\n\r\nThe Nebraska men were very confident of the election of Matteson, though\r\ndenying that he was a candidate, and we very much believing also that they\r\nwould elect him. But they wanted first to make a show of good faith to\r\nShields by voting for him a few times, and our secret Matteson men also\r\nwanted to make a show of good faith by voting with us a few times. So\r\nwe led off. On the seventh ballot, I think, the signal was given to the\r\nNebraska men to turn to Matteson, which they acted on to a man, with one\r\nexception. . . Next ballot the remaining Nebraska man and one pretended\r\nAnti went over to him, giving him 46. The next still another, giving him\r\n47, wanting only three of an election. In the meantime our friends, with\r\na view of detaining our expected bolters, had been turning from me to\r\nTrumbull till he had risen to 35 and I had been reduced to 15. These would\r\nnever desert me except by my direction; but I became satisfied that if we\r\ncould prevent Matteson's election one or two ballots more, we could not\r\npossibly do so a single ballot after my friends should begin to return\r\nto me from Trumbull. So I determined to strike at once, and accordingly\r\nadvised my remaining friends to go for him, which they did and elected him\r\non the tenth ballot.\r\n\r\nSuch is the way the thing was done. I think you would have done the same\r\nunder the circumstances.\r\n\r\nI could have headed off every combination and been elected, had it not\r\nbeen for Matteson's double game--and his defeat now gives me more pleasure\r\nthan my own gives me pain. On the whole, it is perhaps as well for our\r\ngeneral cause that Trumbull is elected. The Nebraska men confess that\r\nthey hate it worse than anything that could have happened. It is a great\r\nconsolation to see them worse whipped than I am.\r\n\r\nYours forever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRETURN TO LAW PROFESSION\r\n\r\nTO SANFORD, PORTER, AND STRIKER, NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, MARCH 10, 1855\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--Yours of the 5th is received, as also was that of 15th Dec,\r\nlast, inclosing bond of Clift to Pray. When I received the bond I was\r\ndabbling in politics, and of course neglecting business. Having since been\r\nbeaten out I have gone to work again.\r\n\r\nAs I do not practice in Rushville, I to-day open a correspondence with\r\nHenry E. Dummer, Esq., of Beardstown, Ill., with the view of getting the\r\njob into his hands. He is a good man if he will undertake it.\r\n\r\nWrite me whether I shall do this or return the bond to you.\r\n\r\nYours respectfully,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO O. H. BROWNING.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, March 23, 1855.\r\n\r\nHON. O. H. BROWNING.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your letter to Judge Logan has been shown to us by him; and,\r\nwith his consent, we answer it. When it became probable that there would\r\nbe a vacancy on the Supreme Bench, public opinion, on this side of the\r\nriver, seemed to be universally directed to Logan as the proper man to\r\nfill it. I mean public opinion on our side in politics, with very small\r\nmanifestation in any different direction by the other side. The result is,\r\nthat he has been a good deal pressed to allow his name to be used, and he\r\nhas consented to it, provided it can be done with perfect cordiality and\r\ngood feeling on the part of all our own friends. We, the undersigned, are\r\nvery anxious for it; and the more so now that he has been urged, until\r\nhis mind is turned upon the matter. We, therefore are very glad of your\r\nletter, with the information it brings us, mixed only with a regret that\r\nwe can not elect Logan and Walker both. We shall be glad, if you will\r\nhoist Logan's name, in your Quincy papers.\r\n\r\nVery truly your friends,\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN, B. S. EWARDS, JOHN T. STUART.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO H. C. WHITNEY.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, June 7, 1855.\r\n\r\nH. C. WHITNEY, ESQ.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Your note containing election news is received; and for\r\nwhich I thank you. It is all of no use, however. Logan is worse beaten\r\nthan any other man ever was since elections were invented--beaten more\r\nthan twelve hundred in this county. It is conceded on all hands that the\r\nProhibitory law is also beaten.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPONSE TO A PRO-SLAVERY FRIEND\r\n\r\nTO JOSHUA. F. SPEED.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, August 24, 1855\r\n\r\nDEAR SPEED:--You know what a poor correspondent I am. Ever since I\r\nreceived your very agreeable letter of the 22d of May, I have been\r\nintending to write you an answer to it. You suggest that in political\r\naction, now, you and I would differ. I suppose we would; not quite as\r\nmuch, however, as you may think. You know I dislike slavery, and you fully\r\nadmit the abstract wrong of it. So far there is no cause of difference.\r\nBut you say that sooner than yield your legal right to the slave,\r\nespecially at the bidding of those who are not themselves interested, you\r\nwould see the Union dissolved. I am not aware that any one is bidding you\r\nyield that right; very certainly I am not. I leave that matter entirely\r\nto yourself. I also acknowledge your rights and my obligations under the\r\nConstitution in regard to your slaves. I confess I hate to see the poor\r\ncreatures hunted down and caught and carried back to their stripes and\r\nunrequited toil; but I bite my lips and keep quiet. In 1841 you and I had\r\ntogether a tedious low-water trip on a steamboat from Louisville to St.\r\nLouis. You may remember, as I well do, that from Louisville to the mouth\r\nof the Ohio there were on board ten or a dozen slaves shackled together\r\nwith irons. That sight was a continued torment to me, and I see something\r\nlike it every time I touch the Ohio or any other slave border. It is not\r\nfair for you to assume that I have no interest in a thing which has, and\r\ncontinually exercises, the power of making me miserable. You ought rather\r\nto appreciate how much the great body of the Northern people do crucify\r\ntheir feelings, in order to maintain their loyalty to the Constitution and\r\nthe Union. I do oppose the extension of slavery because my judgment and\r\nfeeling so prompt me, and I am under no obligations to the contrary.\r\nIf for this you and I must differ, differ we must. You say, if you were\r\nPresident, you would send an army and hang the leaders of the Missouri\r\noutrages upon the Kansas elections; still, if Kansas fairly votes herself\r\na slave State she must be admitted or the Union must be dissolved. But how\r\nif she votes herself a slave State unfairly, that is, by the very means\r\nfor which you say you would hang men? Must she still be admitted, or the\r\nUnion dissolved? That will be the phase of the question when it first\r\nbecomes a practical one. In your assumption that there may be a fair\r\ndecision of the slavery question in Kansas, I plainly see you and I would\r\ndiffer about the Nebraska law. I look upon that enactment not as a law,\r\nbut as a violence from the beginning. It was conceived in violence, is\r\nmaintained in violence, and is being executed in violence. I say it was\r\nconceived in violence, because the destruction of the Missouri Compromise,\r\nunder the circumstances, was nothing less than violence. It was passed in\r\nviolence because it could not have passed at all but for the votes of\r\nmany members in violence of the known will of their constituents. It is\r\nmaintained in violence, because the elections since clearly demand its\r\nrepeal; and the demand is openly disregarded.\r\n\r\nYou say men ought to be hung for the way they are executing the law; I say\r\nthe way it is being executed is quite as good as any of its antecedents.\r\nIt is being executed in the precise way which was intended from the first,\r\nelse why does no Nebraska man express astonishment or condemnation? Poor\r\nReeder is the only public man who has been silly enough to believe\r\nthat anything like fairness was ever intended, and he has been bravely\r\nundeceived.\r\n\r\nThat Kansas will form a slave constitution, and with it will ask to be\r\nadmitted into the Union, I take to be already a settled question, and so\r\nsettled by the very means you so pointedly condemn. By every principle of\r\nlaw ever held by any court North or South, every negro taken to Kansas\r\nis free; yet, in utter disregard of this,--in the spirit of violence\r\nmerely,--that beautiful Legislature gravely passes a law to hang any\r\nman who shall venture to inform a negro of his legal rights. This is the\r\nsubject and real object of the law. If, like Haman, they should hang upon\r\nthe gallows of their own building, I shall not be among the mourners for\r\ntheir fate. In my humble sphere, I shall advocate the restoration of the\r\nMissouri Compromise so long as Kansas remains a Territory, and when, by\r\nall these foul means, it seeks to come into the Union as a slave State, I\r\nshall oppose it. I am very loath in any case to withhold my assent to\r\nthe enjoyment of property acquired or located in good faith; but I do not\r\nadmit that good faith in taking a negro to Kansas to be held in slavery\r\nis a probability with any man. Any man who has sense enough to be the\r\ncontroller of his own property has too much sense to misunderstand the\r\noutrageous character of the whole Nebraska business. But I digress. In my\r\nopposition to the admission of Kansas I shall have some company, but we\r\nmay be beaten. If we are, I shall not on that account attempt to dissolve\r\nthe Union. I think it probable, however, we shall be beaten. Standing as\r\na unit among yourselves, You can, directly and indirectly, bribe enough\r\nof our men to carry the day, as you could on the open proposition to\r\nestablish a monarchy. Get hold of some man in the North whose position and\r\nability is such that he can make the support of your measure, whatever it\r\nmay be, a Democratic party necessity, and the thing is done. Apropos of\r\nthis, let me tell you an anecdote. Douglas introduced the Nebraska Bill in\r\nJanuary. In February afterward there was a called session of the Illinois\r\nLegislature. Of the one hundred members composing the two branches of that\r\nbody, about seventy were Democrats. These latter held a caucus in which\r\nthe Nebraska Bill was talked of, if not formally discussed. It was thereby\r\ndiscovered that just three, and no more, were in favor of the measure. In\r\na day or two Douglas's orders came on to have resolutions passed approving\r\nthe bill; and they were passed by large majorities!!!! The truth of this\r\nis vouched for by a bolting Democratic member. The masses, too, Democratic\r\nas well as Whig, were even nearer unanimous against it; but, as soon\r\nas the party necessity of supporting it became apparent, the way the\r\nDemocrats began to see the wisdom and justice of it was perfectly\r\nastonishing.\r\n\r\nYou say that if Kansas fairly votes herself a free State, as a Christian\r\nyou will rejoice at it. All decent slaveholders talk that way, and I\r\ndo not doubt their candor. But they never vote that way. Although in\r\na private letter or conversation you will express your preference that\r\nKansas shall be free, you would vote for no man for Congress who would say\r\nthe same thing publicly. No such man could be elected from any district\r\nin a slave State. You think Stringfellow and company ought to be hung; and\r\nyet at the next Presidential election you will vote for the exact type and\r\nrepresentative of Stringfellow. The slave-breeders and slave-traders are\r\na small, odious, and detested class among you; and yet in politics they\r\ndictate the course of all of you, and are as completely your masters as\r\nyou are the master of your own negroes. You inquire where I now stand.\r\nThat is a disputed point. I think I am a Whig; but others say there are\r\nno Whigs, and that I am an Abolitionist. When I was at Washington, I voted\r\nfor the Wilmot Proviso as good as forty times; and I never heard of any\r\none attempting to un-Whig me for that. I now do no more than oppose the\r\nextension of slavery. I am not a Know-Nothing; that is certain. How could\r\nI be? How can any one who abhors the oppression of negroes be in favor of\r\ndegrading classes of white people? Our progress in degeneracy appears to\r\nme to be pretty rapid. As a nation we began by declaring that \"all men\r\nare created equal.\" We now practically read it \"all men are created equal,\r\nexcept negroes.\" When the Know-Nothings get control, it will read \"all men\r\nare created equal, except negroes and foreigners and Catholics.\" When it\r\ncomes to this, I shall prefer emigrating to some country where they make\r\nno pretense of loving liberty,--to Russia, for instance, where despotism\r\ncan be taken pure, and without the base alloy of hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nMary will probably pass a day or two in Louisville in October. My kindest\r\nregards to Mrs. Speed. On the leading subject of this letter I have more\r\nof her sympathy than I have of yours; and yet let me say I am,\r\n\r\nYour friend forever,\r\n\r\nA.

MORGAN, ESQ.:\r\n\r\nSays Tom to John, \"Here's your old rotten wheelbarrow. I've broke it usin'\r\non it. I wish you would mend it, 'case I shall want to borrow it this\r\narternoon.\" Acting on this as a precedent, I say, \"Here's your old\r\n'chalked hat,--I wish you would take it and send me a new one, 'case I\r\nshall want to use it the first of March.\"\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n(A 'chalked hat' was the common term, at that time, for a railroad pass.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH DELIVERED BEFORE THE FIRST REPUBLICAN STATE CONVENTION\r\n\r\nOF ILLINOIS, HELD AT BLOOMINGTON, ON MAY 29, 1856.\r\n\r\n[From the Report by William C. Whitney.]\r\n\r\n(Mr. Whitney's notes were made at the time, but not written out until\r\n1896. He does not claim that the speech, as here reported, is literally\r\ncorrect only that he has followed the argument, and that in many cases the\r\nsentences are as Mr. Lincoln spoke them.)\r\n\r\nMr. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN: I was over at [Cries of \"Platform!\" \"Take\r\nthe platform!\"]--I say, that while I was at Danville Court, some of our\r\nfriends of Anti-Nebraska got together in Springfield and elected me as one\r\ndelegate to represent old Sangamon with them in this convention, and I\r\nam here certainly as a sympathizer in this movement and by virtue of that\r\nmeeting and selection. But we can hardly be called delegates strictly,\r\ninasmuch as, properly speaking, we represent nobody but ourselves. I think\r\nit altogether fair to say that we have no Anti-Nebraska party in Sangamon,\r\nalthough there is a good deal of Anti-Nebraska feeling there; but I say\r\nfor myself, and I think I may speak also for my colleagues, that we who\r\nare here fully approve of the platform and of all that has been done [A\r\nvoice, \"Yes!\"], and even if we are not regularly delegates, it will be\r\nright for me to answer your call to speak. I suppose we truly stand for\r\nthe public sentiment of Sangamon on the great question of the repeal,\r\nalthough we do not yet represent many numbers who have taken a distinct\r\nposition on the question.\r\n\r\nWe are in a trying time--it ranges above mere party--and this movement\r\nto call a halt and turn our steps backward needs all the help and good\r\ncounsels it can get; for unless popular opinion makes itself very strongly\r\nfelt, and a change is made in our present course, blood will flow on\r\naccount of Nebraska, and brother's hands will be raised against brother!\r\n\r\n[The last sentence was uttered in such an earnest, impressive, if not,\r\nindeed, tragic, manner, as to make a cold chill creep over me. Others gave\r\na similar experience.]\r\n\r\nI have listened with great interest to the earnest appeal made to Illinois\r\nmen by the gentleman from Lawrence [James S. Emery] who has just addressed\r\nus so eloquently and forcibly. I was deeply moved by his statement of the\r\nwrongs done to free-State men out there. I think it just to say that all\r\ntrue men North should sympathize with them, and ought to be willing to\r\ndo any possible and needful thing to right their wrongs. But we must not\r\npromise what we ought not, lest we be called on to perform what we cannot;\r\nwe must be calm and moderate, and consider the whole difficulty, and\r\ndetermine what is possible and just. We must not be led by excitement\r\nand passion to do that which our sober judgments would not approve in our\r\ncooler moments. We have higher aims; we will have more serious business\r\nthan to dally with temporary measures.\r\n\r\nWe are here to stand firmly for a principle--to stand firmly for a right.\r\nWe know that great political and moral wrongs are done, and outrages\r\ncommitted, and we denounce those wrongs and outrages, although we cannot,\r\nat present, do much more. But we desire to reach out beyond those personal\r\noutrages and establish a rule that will apply to all, and so prevent any\r\nfuture outrages.\r\n\r\nWe have seen to-day that every shade of popular opinion is represented\r\nhere, with Freedom, or rather Free Soil, as the basis. We have come\r\ntogether as in some sort representatives of popular opinion against the\r\nextension of slavery into territory now free in fact as well as by law,\r\nand the pledged word of the statesmen of the nation who are now no more.\r\nWe come--we are here assembled together--to protest as well as we can\r\nagainst a great wrong, and to take measures, as well as we now can, to\r\nmake that wrong right; to place the nation, as far as it may be possible\r\nnow, as it was before the repeal of the Missouri Compromise; and the plain\r\nway to do this is to restore the Compromise, and to demand and determine\r\nthat Kansas shall be free! [Immense applause.] While we affirm, and\r\nreaffirm, if necessary, our devotion to the principles of the Declaration\r\nof Independence, let our practical work here be limited to the above. We\r\nknow that there is not a perfect agreement of sentiment here on the public\r\nquestions which might be rightfully considered in this convention, and\r\nthat the indignation which we all must feel cannot be helped; but all of\r\nus must give up something for the good of the cause. There is one desire\r\nwhich is uppermost in the mind, one wish common to us all, to which no\r\ndissent will be made; and I counsel you earnestly to bury all resentment,\r\nto sink all personal feeling, make all things work to a common purpose in\r\nwhich we are united and agreed about, and which all present will agree is\r\nabsolutely necessary--which must be done by any rightful mode if there\r\nbe such: Slavery must be kept out of Kansas! [Applause.] The test--the\r\npinch--is right there. If we lose Kansas to freedom, an example will be\r\nset which will prove fatal to freedom in the end. We, therefore, in\r\nthe language of the Bible, must \"lay the axe to the root of the tree.\"\r\nTemporizing will not do longer; now is the time for decision--for firm,\r\npersistent, resolute action. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nThe Nebraska Bill, or rather Nebraska law, is not one of wholesome\r\nlegislation, but was and is an act of legislative usurpation, whose\r\nresult, if not indeed intention, is to make slavery national; and unless\r\nheaded off in some effective way, we are in a fair way to see this land\r\nof boasted freedom converted into a land of slavery in fact. [Sensation.]\r\nJust open your two eyes, and see if this be not so. I need do no more than\r\nstate, to command universal approval, that almost the entire North, as\r\nwell as a large following in the border States, is radically opposed to\r\nthe planting of slavery in free territory. Probably in a popular vote\r\nthroughout the nation nine tenths of the voters in the free States, and\r\nat least one-half in the border States, if they could express their\r\nsentiments freely, would vote NO on such an issue; and it is safe to say\r\nthat two thirds of the votes of the entire nation would be opposed to it.\r\nAnd yet, in spite of this overbalancing of sentiment in this free country,\r\nwe are in a fair way to see Kansas present itself for admission as a slave\r\nState. Indeed, it is a felony, by the local law of Kansas, to deny that\r\nslavery exists there even now. By every principle of law, a negro in\r\nKansas is free; yet the bogus Legislature makes it an infamous crime to\r\ntell him that he is free!\r\n\r\nStatutes of Kansas, 1555, chapter 151, Sec. 12: If any free person, by\r\nspeaking or by writing, assert or maintain that persons have not the right\r\nto hold slaves in this Territory, or shall introduce into this Territory,\r\nprint, publish, write, circulate . . . any book, paper, magazine,\r\npamphlet, or circular containing any denial of the right of persons\r\nto hold slaves in this Territory such person shall be deemed guilty of\r\nfelony, and punished by imprisonment at hard labor for a term of not\r\nless than two years. Sec. 13. No person who is conscientiously opposed\r\nto holding slaves, or who does not admit the right to hold slaves in this\r\nTerritory, shall sit as a juror on the trial of any prosecution for any\r\nviolation of any Sections of this Act.\r\n\r\nThe party lash and the fear of ridicule will overawe justice and liberty;\r\nfor it is a singular fact, but none the less a fact, and well known by the\r\nmost common experience, that men will do things under the terror of the\r\nparty lash that they would not on any account or for any consideration\r\ndo otherwise; while men who will march up to the mouth of a loaded cannon\r\nwithout shrinking will run from the terrible name of \"Abolitionist,\"\r\neven when pronounced by a worthless creature whom they, with good reason,\r\ndespise. For instance--to press this point a little--Judge Douglas\r\nintroduced his Nebraska Bill in January; and we had an extra session of\r\nour Legislature in the succeeding February, in which were seventy-five\r\nDemocrats; and at a party caucus, fully attended, there were just three\r\nvotes, out of the whole seventy-five, for the measure. But in a few days\r\norders came on from Washington, commanding them to approve the measure;\r\nthe party lash was applied, and it was brought up again in caucus,\r\nand passed by a large majority. The masses were against it, but party\r\nnecessity carried it; and it was passed through the lower house of\r\nCongress against the will of the people, for the same reason. Here is\r\nwhere the greatest danger lies that, while we profess to be a government\r\nof law and reason, law will give way to violence on demand of this\r\nawful and crushing power. Like the great Juggernaut--I think that is the\r\nname--the great idol, it crushes everything that comes in its way, and\r\nmakes a [?]--or, as I read once, in a blackletter law book, \"a slave is\r\na human being who is legally not a person but a thing.\" And if the\r\nsafeguards to liberty are broken down, as is now attempted, when they have\r\nmade things of all the free negroes, how long, think you, before they\r\nwill begin to make things of poor white men? [Applause.] Be not deceived.\r\nRevolutions do not go backward. The founder of the Democratic party\r\ndeclared that all men were created equal. His successor in the leadership\r\nhas written the word \"white\" before men, making it read \"all white men are\r\ncreated equal.\" Pray, will or may not the Know-Nothings, if they should\r\nget in power, add the word \"Protestant,\" making it read \"all Protestant\r\nwhite men...?\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the hapless negro is the fruitful subject of reprisals in other\r\nquarters. John Pettit, whom Tom Benton paid his respects to, you will\r\nrecollect, calls the immortal Declaration \"a self-evident lie\"; while at\r\nthe birthplace of freedom--in the shadow of Bunker Hill and of the \"cradle\r\nof liberty,\" at the home of the Adamses and Warren and Otis--Choate,\r\nfrom our side of the house, dares to fritter away the birthday promise\r\nof liberty by proclaiming the Declaration to be \"a string of glittering\r\ngeneralities\"; and the Southern Whigs, working hand in hand with\r\nproslavery Democrats, are making Choate's theories practical. Thomas\r\nJefferson, a slaveholder, mindful of the moral element in slavery,\r\nsolemnly declared that he trembled for his country when he remembered that\r\nGod is just; while Judge Douglas, with an insignificant wave of the hand,\r\n\"don't care whether slavery is voted up or voted down.\" Now, if slavery\r\nis right, or even negative, he has a right to treat it in this trifling\r\nmanner. But if it is a moral and political wrong, as all Christendom\r\nconsiders it to be, how can he answer to God for this attempt to spread\r\nand fortify it? [Applause.]\r\n\r\nBut no man, and Judge Douglas no more than any other, can maintain a\r\nnegative, or merely neutral, position on this question; and, accordingly,\r\nhe avows that the Union was made by white men and for white men and their\r\ndescendants. As matter of fact, the first branch of the proposition is\r\nhistorically true; the government was made by white men, and they were\r\nand are the superior race. This I admit. But the corner-stone of the\r\ngovernment, so to speak, was the declaration that \"all men are created\r\nequal,\" and all entitled to \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\"\r\n[Applause.]\r\n\r\nAnd not only so, but the framers of the Constitution were particular\r\nto keep out of that instrument the word \"slave,\" the reason being that\r\nslavery would ultimately come to an end, and they did not wish to have any\r\nreminder that in this free country human beings were ever prostituted to\r\nslavery. [Applause.] Nor is it any argument that we are superior and the\r\nnegro inferior--that he has but one talent while we have ten. Let the\r\nnegro possess the little he has in independence; if he has but one talent,\r\nhe should be permitted to keep the little he has. [Applause:] But slavery\r\nwill endure no test of reason or logic; and yet its advocates, like\r\nDouglas, use a sort of bastard logic, or noisy assumption it might better\r\nbe termed, like the above, in order to prepare the mind for the gradual,\r\nbut none the less certain, encroachments of the Moloch of slavery upon the\r\nfair domain of freedom. But however much you may argue upon it, or smother\r\nit in soft phrase, slavery can only be maintained by force--by violence.\r\nThe repeal of the Missouri Compromise was by violence. It was a violation\r\nof both law and the sacred obligations of honor, to overthrow and trample\r\nunder foot a solemn compromise, obtained by the fearful loss to freedom of\r\none of the fairest of our Western domains. Congress violated the will and\r\nconfidence of its constituents in voting for the bill; and while public\r\nsentiment, as shown by the elections of 1854, demanded the restoration of\r\nthis compromise, Congress violated its trust by refusing simply because it\r\nhad the force of numbers to hold on to it. And murderous violence is being\r\nused now, in order to force slavery on to Kansas; for it cannot be done in\r\nany other way. [Sensation.]\r\n\r\nThe necessary result was to establish the rule of violence--force, instead\r\nof the rule of law and reason; to perpetuate and spread slavery, and\r\nin time to make it general. We see it at both ends of the line. In\r\nWashington, on the very spot where the outrage was started, the fearless\r\nSumner is beaten to insensibility, and is now slowly dying; while senators\r\nwho claim to be gentlemen and Christians stood by, countenancing the\r\nact, and even applauding it afterward in their places in the Senate. Even\r\nDouglas, our man, saw it all and was within helping distance, yet let the\r\nmurderous blows fall unopposed. Then, at the other end of the line, at the\r\nvery time Sumner was being murdered, Lawrence was being destroyed for\r\nthe crime of freedom. It was the most prominent stronghold of liberty in\r\nKansas, and must give way to the all-dominating power of slavery. Only\r\ntwo days ago, Judge Trumbull found it necessary to propose a bill in the\r\nSenate to prevent a general civil war and to restore peace in Kansas.\r\n\r\nWe live in the midst of alarms; anxiety beclouds the future; we expect\r\nsome new disaster with each newspaper we read. Are we in a healthful\r\npolitical state? Are not the tendencies plain? Do not the signs of the\r\ntimes point plainly the way in which we are going? [Sensation.]\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the Constitution slavery was recognized, by South and\r\nNorth alike, as an evil, and the division of sentiment about it was not\r\ncontrolled by geographical lines or considerations of climate, but by\r\nmoral and philanthropic views. Petitions for the abolition of slavery were\r\npresented to the very first Congress by Virginia and Massachusetts alike.\r\nTo show the harmony which prevailed, I will state that a fugitive slave\r\nlaw was passed in 1793, with no dissenting voice in the Senate, and\r\nbut seven dissenting votes in the House. It was, however, a wise law,\r\nmoderate, and, under the Constitution, a just one. Twenty-five years\r\nlater, a more stringent law was proposed and defeated; and thirty-five\r\nyears after that, the present law, drafted by Mason of Virginia, was\r\npassed by Northern votes. I am not, just now, complaining of this law, but\r\nI am trying to show how the current sets; for the proposed law of 1817 was\r\nfar less offensive than the present one. In 1774 the Continental Congress\r\npledged itself, without a dissenting vote, to wholly discontinue the slave\r\ntrade, and to neither purchase nor import any slave; and less than three\r\nmonths before the passage of the Declaration of Independence, the same\r\nCongress which adopted that declaration unanimously resolved \"that no\r\nslave be imported into any of the thirteen United Colonies.\" [Great\r\napplause.]\r\n\r\nOn the second day of July, 1776, the draft of a Declaration of\r\nIndependence was reported to Congress by the committee, and in it the\r\nslave trade was characterized as \"an execrable commerce,\" as \"a piratical\r\nwarfare,\" as the \"opprobrium of infidel powers,\" and as \"a cruel war\r\nagainst human nature.\" [Applause.] All agreed on this except South\r\nCarolina and Georgia, and in order to preserve harmony, and from the\r\nnecessity of the case, these expressions were omitted. Indeed, abolition\r\nsocieties existed as far south as Virginia; and it is a well-known fact\r\nthat Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Lee, Henry, Mason, and Pendleton were\r\nqualified abolitionists, and much more radical on that subject than we\r\nof the Whig and Democratic parties claim to be to-day. On March 1, 1784,\r\nVirginia ceded to the confederation all its lands lying northwest of the\r\nOhio River. Jefferson, Chase of Maryland, and Howell of Rhode Island, as\r\na committee on that and territory thereafter to be ceded, reported that\r\nno slavery should exist after the year 1800. Had this report been adopted,\r\nnot only the Northwest, but Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi\r\nalso would have been free; but it required the assent of nine States to\r\nratify it. North Carolina was divided, and thus its vote was lost; and\r\nDelaware, Georgia, and New Jersey refused to vote. In point of fact, as it\r\nwas, it was assented to by six States. Three years later on a square vote\r\nto exclude slavery from the Northwest, only one vote, and that from New\r\nYork, was against it. And yet, thirty-seven years later, five thousand\r\ncitizens of Illinois, out of a voting mass of less than twelve thousand,\r\ndeliberately, after a long and heated contest, voted to introduce slavery\r\nin Illinois; and, to-day, a large party in the free State of Illinois are\r\nwilling to vote to fasten the shackles of slavery on the fair domain of\r\nKansas, notwithstanding it received the dowry of freedom long before its\r\nbirth as a political community. I repeat, therefore, the question: Is it\r\nnot plain in what direction we are tending? [Sensation.] In the colonial\r\ntime, Mason, Pendleton, and Jefferson were as hostile to slavery in\r\nVirginia as Otis, Ames, and the Adamses were in Massachusetts; and\r\nVirginia made as earnest an effort to get rid of it as old Massachusetts\r\ndid. But circumstances were against them and they failed; but not that the\r\ngood will of its leading men was lacking. Yet within less than fifty years\r\nVirginia changed its tune, and made negro-breeding for the cotton and\r\nsugar States one of its leading industries. [Laughter and applause.]\r\n\r\nIn the Constitutional Convention, George Mason of Virginia made a more\r\nviolent abolition speech than my friends Lovejoy or Codding would desire\r\nto make here to-day--a speech which could not be safely repeated anywhere\r\non Southern soil in this enlightened year. But, while there were some\r\ndifferences of opinion on this subject even then, discussion was allowed;\r\nbut as you see by the Kansas slave code, which, as you know, is the\r\nMissouri slave code, merely ferried across the river, it is a felony\r\nto even express an opinion hostile to that foul blot in the land of\r\nWashington and the Declaration of Independence. [Sensation.]\r\n\r\nIn Kentucky--my State--in 1849, on a test vote, the mighty influence\r\nof Henry Clay and many other good then there could not get a symptom of\r\nexpression in favor of gradual emancipation on a plain issue of marching\r\ntoward the light of civilization with Ohio and Illinois; but the State of\r\nBoone and Hardin and Henry Clay, with a nigger under each arm, took the\r\nblack trail toward the deadly swamps of barbarism. Is there--can there\r\nbe--any doubt about this thing? And is there any doubt that we must all\r\nlay aside our prejudices and march, shoulder to shoulder, in the great\r\narmy of Freedom? [Applause.]\r\n\r\nEvery Fourth of July our young orators all proclaim this to be \"the land\r\nof the free and the home of the brave!\" Well, now, when you orators get\r\nthat off next year, and, may be, this very year, how would you like some\r\nold grizzled farmer to get up in the grove and deny it? [Laughter.] How\r\nwould you like that? But suppose Kansas comes in as a slave State, and\r\nall the \"border ruffians\" have barbecues about it, and free-State men come\r\ntrailing back to the dishonored North, like whipped dogs with their tails\r\nbetween their legs, it is--ain't it?--evident that this is no more the\r\n\"land of the free\"; and if we let it go so, we won't dare to say \"home of\r\nthe brave\" out loud. [Sensation and confusion.]\r\n\r\nCan any man doubt that, even in spite of the people's will, slavery will\r\ntriumph through violence, unless that will be made manifest and enforced?\r\nEven Governor Reeder claimed at the outset that the contest in Kansas was\r\nto be fair, but he got his eyes open at last; and I believe that, as a\r\nresult of this moral and physical violence, Kansas will soon apply for\r\nadmission as a slave State. And yet we can't mistake that the people\r\ndon't want it so, and that it is a land which is free both by natural\r\nand political law. No law, is free law! Such is the understanding of all\r\nChristendom. In the Somerset case, decided nearly a century ago, the great\r\nLord Mansfield held that slavery was of such a nature that it must take\r\nits rise in positive (as distinguished from natural) law; and that in no\r\ncountry or age could it be traced back to any other source. Will some\r\none please tell me where is the positive law that establishes slavery in\r\nKansas? [A voice: \"The bogus laws.\"] Aye, the bogus laws! And, on the same\r\nprinciple, a gang of Missouri horse-thieves could come into Illinois and\r\ndeclare horse-stealing to be legal [Laughter], and it would be just as\r\nlegal as slavery is in Kansas. But by express statute, in the land of\r\nWashington and Jefferson, we may soon be brought face to face with the\r\ndiscreditable fact of showing to the world by our acts that we prefer\r\nslavery to freedom--darkness to light! [Sensation.]\r\n\r\nIt is, I believe, a principle in law that when one party to a contract\r\nviolates it so grossly as to chiefly destroy the object for which it is\r\nmade, the other party may rescind it. I will ask Browning if that ain't\r\ngood law. [Voices: \"Yes!\"] Well, now if that be right, I go for rescinding\r\nthe whole, entire Missouri Compromise and thus turning Missouri into a\r\nfree State; and I should like to know the difference--should like for\r\nany one to point out the difference--between our making a free State of\r\nMissouri and their making a slave State of Kansas. [Great applause.] There\r\nain't one bit of difference, except that our way would be a great mercy\r\nto humanity. But I have never said, and the Whig party has never said, and\r\nthose who oppose the Nebraska Bill do not as a body say, that they\r\nhave any intention of interfering with slavery in the slave States. Our\r\nplatform says just the contrary. We allow slavery to exist in the slave\r\nStates, not because slavery is right or good, but from the necessities of\r\nour Union. We grant a fugitive slave law because it is so \"nominated in\r\nthe bond\"; because our fathers so stipulated--had to--and we are bound to\r\ncarry out this agreement. But they did not agree to introduce slavery in\r\nregions where it did not previously exist. On the contrary, they said by\r\ntheir example and teachings that they did not deem it expedient--did n't\r\nconsider it right--to do so; and it is wise and right to do just as\r\nthey did about it. [Voices: \"Good!\"] And that it what we propose--not to\r\ninterfere with slavery where it exists (we have never tried to do it),\r\nand to give them a reasonable and efficient fugitive slave law. [A voice:\r\n\"No!\"] I say YES! [Applause.] It was part of the bargain, and I 'm for\r\nliving up to it; but I go no further; I'm not bound to do more, and I\r\nwon't agree any further. [Great applause.]\r\n\r\nWe, here in Illinois, should feel especially proud of the provision of\r\nthe Missouri Compromise excluding slavery from what is now Kansas; for an\r\nIllinois man, Jesse B. Thomas, was its father. Henry Clay, who is credited\r\nwith the authorship of the Compromise in general terms, did not even vote\r\nfor that provision, but only advocated the ultimate admission by a second\r\ncompromise; and Thomas was, beyond all controversy, the real author of the\r\n\"slavery restriction\" branch of the Compromise. To show the generosity of\r\nthe Northern members toward the Southern side: on a test vote to exclude\r\nslavery from Missouri, ninety voted not to exclude, and eighty-seven to\r\nexclude, every vote from the slave States being ranged with the former and\r\nfourteen votes from the free States, of whom seven were from New England\r\nalone; while on a vote to exclude slavery from what is now Kansas, the\r\nvote was one hundred and thirty-four for, to forty-two against. The\r\nscheme, as a whole, was, of course, a Southern triumph. It is idle to\r\ncontend otherwise, as is now being done by the Nebraskites; it was\r\nso shown by the votes and quite as emphatically by the expressions of\r\nrepresentative men. Mr. Lowndes of South Carolina was never known to\r\ncommit a political mistake; his was the great judgment of that section;\r\nand he declared that this measure \"would restore tranquillity to the\r\ncountry--a result demanded by every consideration of discretion, of\r\nmoderation, of wisdom, and of virtue.\" When the measure came before\r\nPresident Monroe for his approval, he put to each member of his cabinet\r\nthis question: \"Has Congress the constitutional power to prohibit slavery\r\nin a Territory?\" And John C. Calhoun and William H. Crawford from the\r\nSouth, equally with John Quincy Adams, Benjamin Rush, and Smith\r\nThompson from the North, alike answered, \"Yes!\" without qualification or\r\nequivocation; and this measure, of so great consequence to the South, was\r\npassed; and Missouri was, by means of it, finally enabled to knock at the\r\ndoor of the Republic for an open passage to its brood of slaves. And, in\r\nspite of this, Freedom's share is about to be taken by violence--by the\r\nforce of misrepresentative votes, not called for by the popular will.\r\nWhat name can I, in common decency, give to this wicked transaction?\r\n[Sensation.]\r\n\r\nBut even then the contest was not over; for when the Missouri constitution\r\ncame before Congress for its approval, it forbade any free negro or\r\nmulatto from entering the State. In short, our Illinois \"black laws\" were\r\nhidden away in their constitution [Laughter], and the controversy was thus\r\nrevived. Then it was that Mr. Clay's talents shone out conspicuously, and\r\nthe controversy that shook the union to its foundation was finally settled\r\nto the satisfaction of the conservative parties on both sides of the line,\r\nthough not to the extremists on either, and Missouri was admitted by the\r\nsmall majority of six in the lower House. How great a majority, do you\r\nthink, would have been given had Kansas also been secured for slavery?\r\n[A voice: \"A majority the other way.\"] \"A majority the other way,\" is\r\nanswered. Do you think it would have been safe for a Northern man to have\r\nconfronted his constituents after having voted to consign both\r\nMissouri and Kansas to hopeless slavery? And yet this man Douglas, who\r\nmisrepresents his constituents and who has exerted his highest talents in\r\nthat direction, will be carried in triumph through the State and hailed\r\nwith honor while applauding that act. [Three groans for \"Dug!\"] And this\r\nshows whither we are tending. This thing of slavery is more powerful than\r\nits supporters--even than the high priests that minister at its altar.\r\nIt debauches even our greatest men. It gathers strength, like a rolling\r\nsnowball, by its own infamy. Monstrous crimes are committed in its name by\r\npersons collectively which they would not dare to commit as individuals.\r\nIts aggressions and encroachments almost surpass belief. In a despotism,\r\none might not wonder to see slavery advance steadily and remorselessly\r\ninto new dominions; but is it not wonderful, is it not even alarming, to\r\nsee its steady advance in a land dedicated to the proposition that \"all\r\nmen are created equal\"? [Sensation.]\r\n\r\nIt yields nothing itself; it keeps all it has, and gets all it can\r\nbesides. It really came dangerously near securing Illinois in 1824; it\r\ndid get Missouri in 1821. The first proposition was to admit what is now\r\nArkansas and Missouri as one slave State. But the territory was divided\r\nand Arkansas came in, without serious question, as a slave State; and\r\nafterwards Missouri, not, as a sort of equality, free, but also as a slave\r\nState. Then we had Florida and Texas; and now Kansas is about to be forced\r\ninto the dismal procession. [Sensation.] And so it is wherever you look.\r\nWe have not forgotten--it is but six years since--how dangerously near\r\nCalifornia came to being a slave State. Texas is a slave State, and four\r\nother slave States may be carved from its vast domain. And yet, in the\r\nyear 1829, slavery was abolished throughout that vast region by a royal\r\ndecree of the then sovereign of Mexico. Will you please tell me by what\r\nright slavery exists in Texas to-day? By the same right as, and no higher\r\nor greater than, slavery is seeking dominion in Kansas: by political\r\nforce--peaceful, if that will suffice; by the torch (as in Kansas) and the\r\nbludgeon (as in the Senate chamber), if required. And so history repeats\r\nitself; and even as slavery has kept its course by craft, intimidation,\r\nand violence in the past, so it will persist, in my judgment, until met\r\nand dominated by the will of a people bent on its restriction.\r\n\r\nWe have, this very afternoon, heard bitter denunciations of Brooks in\r\nWashington, and Titus, Stringfellow, Atchison, Jones, and Shannon in\r\nKansas--the battle-ground of slavery. I certainly am not going to advocate\r\nor shield them; but they and their acts are but the necessary outcome of\r\nthe Nebraska law. We should reserve our highest censure for the authors\r\nof the mischief, and not for the catspaws which they use. I believe it was\r\nShakespeare who said, \"Where the offence lies, there let the axe fall\";\r\nand, in my opinion, this man Douglas and the Northern men in Congress\r\nwho advocate \"Nebraska\" are more guilty than a thousand Joneses and\r\nStringfellows, with all their murderous practices, can be. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nWe have made a good beginning here to-day. As our Methodist friends would\r\nsay, \"I feel it is good to be here.\" While extremists may find some fault\r\nwith the moderation of our platform, they should recollect that \"the\r\nbattle is not always to the strong, nor the race to the swift.\" In grave\r\nemergencies, moderation is generally safer than radicalism; and as this\r\nstruggle is likely to be long and earnest, we must not, by our action,\r\nrepel any who are in sympathy with us in the main, but rather win all that\r\nwe can to our standard. We must not belittle nor overlook the facts of our\r\ncondition--that we are new and comparatively weak, while our enemies are\r\nentrenched and relatively strong. They have the administration and the\r\npolitical power; and, right or wrong, at present they have the numbers.\r\nOur friends who urge an appeal to arms with so much force and eloquence\r\nshould recollect that the government is arrayed against us, and that the\r\nnumbers are now arrayed against us as well; or, to state it nearer to the\r\ntruth, they are not yet expressly and affirmatively for us; and we should\r\nrepel friends rather than gain them by anything savoring of revolutionary\r\nmethods. As it now stands, we must appeal to the sober sense and\r\npatriotism of the people. We will make converts day by day; we will grow\r\nstrong by calmness and moderation; we will grow strong by the violence and\r\ninjustice of our adversaries. And, unless truth be a mockery and justice\r\na hollow lie, we will be in the majority after a while, and then the\r\nrevolution which we will accomplish will be none the less radical from\r\nbeing the result of pacific measures. The battle of freedom is to be\r\nfought out on principle. Slavery is a violation of the eternal right. We\r\nhave temporized with it from the necessities of our condition; but as sure\r\nas God reigns and school children read, THAT BLACK FOUL LIE CAN NEVER\r\nBE CONSECRATED INTO GOD'S HALLOWED TRUTH! [Immense applause lasting some\r\ntime.]\r\n\r\nOne of our greatest difficulties is, that men who know that slavery is a\r\ndetestable crime and ruinous to the nation are compelled, by our peculiar\r\ncondition and other circumstances, to advocate it concretely, though\r\ndamning it in the raw. Henry Clay was a brilliant example of this\r\ntendency; others of our purest statesmen are compelled to do so; and thus\r\nslavery secures actual support from those who detest it at heart. Yet\r\nHenry Clay perfected and forced through the compromise which secured to\r\nslavery a great State as well as a political advantage. Not that he hated\r\nslavery less, but that he loved the whole Union more. As long as slavery\r\nprofited by his great compromise, the hosts of proslavery could not\r\nsufficiently cover him with praise; but now that this compromise stands in\r\ntheir way--\r\n\r\n   \"....they never mention him,\r\n   His name is never heard:\r\n   Their lips are now forbid to speak\r\n   That once familiar word.\"\r\n\r\nThey have slaughtered one of his most cherished measures, and his ghost\r\nwould arise to rebuke them. [Great applause.]\r\n\r\nNow, let us harmonize, my friends, and appeal to the moderation and\r\npatriotism of the people: to the sober second thought; to the awakened\r\npublic conscience. The repeal of the sacred Missouri Compromise has\r\ninstalled the weapons of violence: the bludgeon, the incendiary torch, the\r\ndeath-dealing rifle, the bristling cannon--the weapons of kingcraft, of\r\nthe inquisition, of ignorance, of barbarism, of oppression. We see its\r\nfruits in the dying bed of the heroic Sumner; in the ruins of the \"Free\r\nState\" hotel; in the smoking embers of the Herald of Freedom; in the\r\nfree-State Governor of Kansas chained to a stake on freedom's soil like a\r\nhorse-thief, for the crime of freedom. [Applause.] We see it in Christian\r\nstatesmen, and Christian newspapers, and Christian pulpits applauding the\r\ncowardly act of a low bully, WHO CRAWLED UPON HIS VICTIM BEHIND HIS BACK\r\nAND DEALT THE DEADLY BLOW. [Sensation and applause.] We note our political\r\ndemoralization in the catch-words that are coming into such common use;\r\non the one hand, \"freedom-shriekers,\" and sometimes \"freedom-screechers\"\r\n[Laughter], and, on the other hand, \"border-ruffians,\" and that fully\r\ndeserved. And the significance of catch-words cannot pass unheeded, for\r\nthey constitute a sign of the times. Everything in this world \"jibes\" in\r\nwith everything else, and all the fruits of this Nebraska Bill are like\r\nthe poisoned source from which they come. I will not say that we may not\r\nsooner or later be compelled to meet force by force; but the time has not\r\nyet come, and, if we are true to ourselves, may never come. Do not mistake\r\nthat the ballot is stronger than the bullet. Therefore let the legions\r\nof slavery use bullets; but let us wait patiently till November and fire\r\nballots at them in return; and by that peaceful policy I believe we shall\r\nultimately win. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nIt was by that policy that here in Illinois the early fathers fought the\r\ngood fight and gained the victory. In 1824 the free men of our State, led\r\nby Governor Coles (who was a native of Maryland and President Madison's\r\nprivate secretary), determined that those beautiful groves should never\r\nre-echo the dirge of one who has no title to himself. By their resolute\r\ndetermination, the winds that sweep across our broad prairies shall never\r\ncool the parched brow, nor shall the unfettered streams that bring joy and\r\ngladness to our free soil water the tired feet, of a slave; but so long as\r\nthose heavenly breezes and sparkling streams bless the land, or the groves\r\nand their fragrance or memory remain, the humanity to which they minister\r\nSHALL BE FOREVER FREE! [Great applause] Palmer, Yates, Williams, Browning,\r\nand some more in this convention came from Kentucky to Illinois (instead\r\nof going to Missouri), not only to better their conditions, but also to\r\nget away from slavery. They have said so to me, and it is understood among\r\nus Kentuckians that we don't like it one bit. Now, can we, mindful of the\r\nblessings of liberty which the early men of Illinois left to us, refuse a\r\nlike privilege to the free men who seek to plant Freedom's banner on our\r\nWestern outposts? [\"No!\" \"No!\"] Should we not stand by our neighbors who\r\nseek to better their conditions in Kansas and Nebraska? [\"Yes!\" \"Yes!\"]\r\nCan we as Christian men, and strong and free ourselves, wield the sledge\r\nor hold the iron which is to manacle anew an already oppressed race?\r\n[\"No!\" \"No!\"] \"Woe unto them,\" it is written, \"that decree unrighteous\r\ndecrees and that write grievousness which they have prescribed.\" Can we\r\nafford to sin any more deeply against human liberty? [\"No!\" \"No!\"]\r\n\r\nOne great trouble in the matter is, that slavery is an insidious and\r\ncrafty power, and gains equally by open violence of the brutal as well as\r\nby sly management of the peaceful. Even after the Ordinance of 1787, the\r\nsettlers in Indiana and Illinois (it was all one government then) tried to\r\nget Congress to allow slavery temporarily, and petitions to that end were\r\nsent from Kaskaskia, and General Harrison, the Governor, urged it from\r\nVincennes, the capital. If that had succeeded, good-bye to liberty here.\r\nBut John Randolph of Virginia made a vigorous report against it; and\r\nalthough they persevered so well as to get three favorable reports for it,\r\nyet the United States Senate, with the aid of some slave States, finally\r\nsquelched if for good. [Applause.] And that is why this hall is to-day a\r\ntemple for free men instead of a negro livery-stable. [Great applause and\r\nlaughter.] Once let slavery get planted in a locality, by ever so weak or\r\ndoubtful a title, and in ever so small numbers, and it is like the Canada\r\nthistle or Bermuda grass--you can't root it out. You yourself may detest\r\nslavery; but your neighbor has five or six slaves, and he is an excellent\r\nneighbor, or your son has married his daughter, and they beg you to help\r\nsave their property, and you vote against your interests and principle to\r\naccommodate a neighbor, hoping that your vote will be on the losing side.\r\nAnd others do the same; and in those ways slavery gets a sure foothold.\r\nAnd when that is done the whole mighty Union--the force of the nation--is\r\ncommitted to its support. And that very process is working in Kansas\r\nto-day. And you must recollect that the slave property is worth a billion\r\nof dollars; while free-State men must work for sentiment alone. Then there\r\nare \"blue lodges\"--as they call them--everywhere doing their secret and\r\ndeadly work.\r\n\r\nIt is a very strange thing, and not solvable by any moral law that I know\r\nof, that if a man loses his horse, the whole country will turn out to\r\nhelp hang the thief; but if a man but a shade or two darker than I am is\r\nhimself stolen, the same crowd will hang one who aids in restoring him to\r\nliberty. Such are the inconsistencies of slavery, where a horse is more\r\nsacred than a man; and the essence of squatter or popular sovereignty--I\r\ndon't care how you call it--is that if one man chooses to make a slave of\r\nanother, no third man shall be allowed to object. And if you can do this\r\nin free Kansas, and it is allowed to stand, the next thing you will see is\r\nshiploads of negroes from Africa at the wharf at Charleston, for one thing\r\nis as truly lawful as the other; and these are the bastard notions we have\r\ngot to stamp out, else they will stamp us out. [Sensation and applause.]\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, at Springfield, Judge Douglas avowed that Illinois came\r\ninto the Union as a slave State, and that slavery was weeded out by\r\nthe operation of his great, patent, everlasting principle of \"popular\r\nsovereignty.\" [Laughter.] Well, now, that argument must be answered, for\r\nit has a little grain of truth at the bottom. I do not mean that it is\r\ntrue in essence, as he would have us believe. It could not be essentially\r\ntrue if the Ordinance of '87 was valid. But, in point of fact, there\r\nwere some degraded beings called slaves in Kaskaskia and the other French\r\nsettlements when our first State constitution was adopted; that is a fact,\r\nand I don't deny it. Slaves were brought here as early as 1720, and were\r\nkept here in spite of the Ordinance of 1787 against it. But slavery did\r\nnot thrive here. On the contrary, under the influence of the ordinance the\r\nnumber decreased fifty-one from 1810 to 1820; while under the influence of\r\nsquatter sovereignty, right across the river in Missouri, they increased\r\nseven thousand two hundred and eleven in the same time; and slavery\r\nfinally faded out in Illinois, under the influence of the law of freedom,\r\nwhile it grew stronger and stronger in Missouri, under the law or practice\r\nof \"popular sovereignty.\" In point of fact there were but one hundred and\r\nseventeen slaves in Illinois one year after its admission, or one to every\r\nfour hundred and seventy of its population; or, to state it in another\r\nway, if Illinois was a slave State in 1820, so were New York and New\r\nJersey much greater slave States from having had greater numbers, slavery\r\nhaving been established there in very early times. But there is this vital\r\ndifference between all these States and the Judge's Kansas experiment:\r\nthat they sought to disestablish slavery which had been already\r\nestablished, while the Judge seeks, so far as he can, to disestablish\r\nfreedom, which had been established there by the Missouri Compromise.\r\n[Voices: \"Good!\"]\r\n\r\nThe Union is under-going a fearful strain; but it is a stout old ship, and\r\nhas weathered many a hard blow, and \"the stars in their courses,\" aye, an\r\ninvisible Power, greater than the puny efforts of men, will fight for us.\r\nBut we ourselves must not decline the burden of responsibility, nor take\r\ncounsel of unworthy passions. Whatever duty urges us to do or to omit must\r\nbe done or omitted; and the recklessness with which our adversaries break\r\nthe laws, or counsel their violation, should afford no example for us.\r\nTherefore, let us revere the Declaration of Independence; let us continue\r\nto obey the Constitution and the laws; let us keep step to the music of\r\nthe Union. Let us draw a cordon, so to speak, around the slave States, and\r\nthe hateful institution, like a reptile poisoning itself, will perish by\r\nits own infamy. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nBut we cannot be free men if this is, by our national choice, to be a\r\nland of slavery. Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for\r\nthemselves; and, under the rule of a just God, cannot long retain it.[Loud\r\napplause.]\r\n\r\nDid you ever, my friends, seriously reflect upon the speed with which we\r\nare tending downwards? Within the memory of men now present the leading\r\nstatesman of Virginia could make genuine, red-hot abolitionist speeches in\r\nold Virginia! and, as I have said, now even in \"free Kansas\" it is a crime\r\nto declare that it is \"free Kansas.\" The very sentiments that I and others\r\nhave just uttered would entitle us, and each of us, to the ignominy and\r\nseclusion of a dungeon; and yet I suppose that, like Paul, we were \"free\r\nborn.\" But if this thing is allowed to continue, it will be but one step\r\nfurther to impress the same rule in Illinois. [Sensation.]\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of all is, that we must restore the Missouri Compromise.\r\nWe must highly resolve that Kansas must be free! [Great applause.] We\r\nmust reinstate the birthday promise of the Republic; we must reaffirm the\r\nDeclaration of Independence; we must make good in essence as well as in\r\nform Madison's avowal that \"the word slave ought not to appear in the\r\nConstitution\"; and we must even go further, and decree that only local\r\nlaw, and not that time-honored instrument, shall shelter a slaveholder. We\r\nmust make this a land of liberty in fact, as it is in name. But in seeking\r\nto attain these results--so indispensable if the liberty which is our\r\npride and boast shall endure--we will be loyal to the Constitution and\r\nto the \"flag of our Union,\" and no matter what our grievance--even though\r\nKansas shall come in as a slave State; and no matter what theirs--even if\r\nwe shall restore the compromise--WE WILL SAY TO THE SOUTHERN DISUNIONISTS,\r\nWE WON'T GO OUT OF THE UNION, AND YOU SHAN'T!\r\n\r\n[This was the climax; the audience rose to its feet en masse, applauded,\r\nstamped, waved handkerchiefs, threw hats in the air, and ran riot for\r\nseveral minutes. The arch-enchanter who wrought this transformation\r\nlooked, meanwhile, like the personification of political justice.]\r\n\r\nBut let us, meanwhile, appeal to the sense and patriotism of the people,\r\nand not to their prejudices; let us spread the floods of enthusiasm here\r\naroused all over these vast prairies, so suggestive of freedom. Let us\r\ncommence by electing the gallant soldier Governor (Colonel) Bissell\r\nwho stood for the honor of our State alike on the plains and amidst the\r\nchaparral of Mexico and on the floor of Congress, while he defied the\r\nSouthern Hotspur; and that will have a greater moral effect than all the\r\nborder ruffians can accomplish in all their raids on Kansas. There is both\r\na power and a magic in popular opinion. To that let us now appeal;\r\nand while, in all probability, no resort to force will be needed, our\r\nmoderation and forbearance will stand US in good stead when, if ever, WE\r\nMUST MAKE AN APPEAL TO BATTLE AND TO THE GOD OF HOSTS! [Immense applause\r\nand a rush for the orator.]\r\n\r\nOne can realize with this ability to move people's minds that the Southern\r\nConspiracy were right to hate this man. He, better than any at the time\r\nwas able to uncover their stratagems and tear down their sophisms and\r\ncontradictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL CORRESPONDENCE\r\n\r\nTO W. C. WHITNEY.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, July 9, 1856.\r\n\r\nDEAR WHITNEY:--I now expect to go to Chicago on the 15th, and I probably\r\nshall remain there or thereabouts for about two weeks.\r\n\r\nIt turned me blind when I first heard Swett was beaten and Lovejoy\r\nnominated; but, after much reflection, I really believe it is best to let\r\nit stand. This, of course, I wish to be confidential.\r\n\r\nLamon did get your deeds. I went with him to the office, got them, and put\r\nthem in his hands myself.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON OUT-OF-STATE CAMPAIGNERS\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM GRIMES.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, July 12, 1856\r\n\r\nYour's of the 29th of June was duly received. I did not answer it because\r\nit plagued me. This morning I received another from Judd and Peck, written\r\nby consultation with you. Now let me tell you why I am plagued:\r\n\r\n1. I can hardly spare the time.\r\n\r\n2. I am superstitious. I have scarcely known a party preceding an election\r\nto call in help from the neighboring States but they lost the State. Last\r\nfall, our friends had Wade, of Ohio, and others, in Maine; and they lost\r\nthe State. Last spring our adversaries had New Hampshire full of South\r\nCarolinians, and they lost the State. And so, generally, it seems to stir\r\nup more enemies than friends.\r\n\r\nHave the enemy called in any foreign help? If they have a foreign champion\r\nthere I should have no objection to drive a nail in his track. I shall\r\nreach Chicago on the night of the 15th, to attend to a little business\r\nin court. Consider the things I have suggested, and write me at Chicago.\r\nEspecially write me whether Browning consents to visit you.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN SPEECH\r\n\r\nFRAGMENT OF SPEECH AT GALENA, ILLINOIS, IN THE FREMONT CAMPAIGN,\r\n\r\nAUGUST 1, 1856.\r\n\r\nYou further charge us with being disunionists. If you mean that it is\r\nour aim to dissolve the Union, I for myself answer that it is untrue; for\r\nthose who act with me I answer that it is untrue. Have you heard us assert\r\nthat as our aim? Do you really believe that such is our aim? Do you find\r\nit in our platform, our speeches, our conventions, or anywhere? If not,\r\nwithdraw the charge.\r\n\r\nBut you may say that, though it is not our aim, it will be the result\r\nif we succeed, and that we are therefore disunionists in fact. This is a\r\ngrave charge you make against us, and we certainly have a right to demand\r\nthat you specify in what way we are to dissolve the Union. How are we to\r\neffect this?\r\n\r\nThe only specification offered is volunteered by Mr. Fillmore in\r\nhis Albany speech. His charge is that if we elect a President and\r\nVice-President both from the free States, it will dissolve the Union.\r\nThis is open folly. The Constitution provides that the President and\r\nVice-President of the United States shall be of different States, but says\r\nnothing as to the latitude and longitude of those States. In 1828 Andrew\r\nJackson, of Tennessee, and John C. Calhoun, of South Carolina, were\r\nelected President and Vice-President, both from slave States; but no one\r\nthought of dissolving the Union then on that account. In 1840 Harrison, of\r\nOhio, and Tyler, of Virginia, were elected. In 1841 Harrison died and John\r\nTyler succeeded to the Presidency, and William R. King, of Alabama, was\r\nelected acting Vice-President by the Senate; but no one supposed that the\r\nUnion was in danger. In fact, at the very time Mr. Fillmore uttered this\r\nidle charge, the state of things in the United States disproved it. Mr.\r\nPierce, of New Hampshire, and Mr. Bright, of Indiana, both from free\r\nStates, are President and Vice-President, and the Union stands and will\r\nstand. You do not pretend that it ought to dissolve the Union, and the\r\nfacts show that it won't; therefore the charge may be dismissed without\r\nfurther consideration.\r\n\r\nNo other specification is made, and the only one that could be made is\r\nthat the restoration of the restriction of 1820, making the United States\r\nterritory free territory, would dissolve the Union. Gentlemen, it will\r\nrequire a decided majority to pass such an act. We, the majority, being\r\nable constitutionally to do all that we purpose, would have no desire to\r\ndissolve the Union. Do you say that such restriction of slavery would\r\nbe unconstitutional, and that some of the States would not submit to its\r\nenforcement? I grant you that an unconstitutional act is not a law; but\r\nI do not ask and will not take your construction of the Constitution.\r\nThe Supreme Court of the United States is the tribunal to decide such a\r\nquestion, and we will submit to its decisions; and if you do also,\r\nthere will be an end of the matter. Will you? If not, who are the\r\ndisunionists--you or we? We, the majority, would not strive to dissolve\r\nthe Union; and if any attempt is made, it must be by you, who so loudly\r\nstigmatize us as disunionists. But the Union, in any event, will not be\r\ndissolved. We don't want to dissolve it, and if you attempt it we won't\r\nlet you. With the purse and sword, the army and navy and treasury, in our\r\nhands and at our command, you could not do it. This government would be\r\nvery weak indeed if a majority with a disciplined army and navy and\r\na well-filled treasury could not preserve itself when attacked by an\r\nunarmed, undisciplined, unorganized minority. All this talk about the\r\ndissolution of the Union is humbug, nothing but folly. We do not want to\r\ndissolve the Union; you shall not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE DANGER OF THIRD-PARTIES\r\n\r\nTO JOHN BENNETT.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, AUG. 4, 1856\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--I understand you are a Fillmore man. If, as between Fremont\r\nand Buchanan, you really prefer the election of Buchanan, then burn this\r\nwithout reading a line further. But if you would like to defeat Buchanan\r\nand his gang, allow me a word with you: Does any one pretend that Fillmore\r\ncan carry the vote of this State? I have not heard a single man pretend\r\nso. Every vote taken from Fremont and given to Fillmore is just so much\r\nin favor of Buchanan. The Buchanan men see this; and hence their great\r\nanxiety in favor of the Fillmore movement. They know where the shoe\r\npinches. They now greatly prefer having a man of your character go for\r\nFillmore than for Buchanan because they expect several to go with you, who\r\nwould go for Fremont if you were to go directly for Buchanan.\r\n\r\nI think I now understand the relative strength of the three parties in\r\nthis State as well as any one man does, and my opinion is that to-day\r\nBuchanan has alone 85,000, Fremont 78,000, and Fillmore 21,000.\r\n\r\nThis gives B. the State by 7000 and leaves him in the minority of the\r\nwhole 14,000.\r\n\r\nFremont and Fillmore men being united on Bissell, as they already are,\r\nhe cannot be beaten. This is not a long letter, but it contains the whole\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JESSE K. DUBOIS.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Aug. 19, 1856.\r\n\r\nDEAR DUBOIS: Your letter on the same sheet with Mr. Miller's is just\r\nreceived. I have been absent four days. I do not know when your court\r\nsits.\r\n\r\nTrumbull has written the committee here to have a set of appointments\r\nmade for him commencing here in Springfield, on the 11th of Sept., and\r\nto extend throughout the south half of the State. When he goes to\r\nLawrenceville, as he will, I will strain every nerve to be with you and\r\nhim. More than that I cannot promise now.\r\n\r\nYours as truly as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HARRISON MALTBY.\r\n\r\n[Confidential]\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, September 8, 1856.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--I understand you are a Fillmore man. Let me prove to you that\r\nevery vote withheld from Fremont and given to Fillmore in this State\r\nactually lessens Fillmore's chance of being President. Suppose Buchanan\r\ngets all the slave States and Pennsylvania, and any other one State\r\nbesides; then he is elected, no matter who gets all the rest. But suppose\r\nFillmore gets the two slave States of Maryland and Kentucky; then Buchanan\r\nis not elected; Fillmore goes into the House of Representatives, and may\r\nbe made President by a compromise. But suppose, again, Fillmore's friends\r\nthrow away a few thousand votes on him in Indiana and Illinois; it will\r\ninevitably give these States to Buchanan, which will more than compensate\r\nhim for the loss of Maryland and Kentucky, will elect him, and leave\r\nFillmore no chance in the House of Representatives or out of it.\r\n\r\nThis is as plain as adding up the weight of three small hogs. As Mr.\r\nFillmore has no possible chance to carry Illinois for himself, it is\r\nplainly to his interest to let Fremont take it, and thus keep it out of\r\nthe hands of Buchanan. Be not deceived. Buchanan is the hard horse to beat\r\nin this race. Let him have Illinois, and nothing can beat him; and he will\r\nget Illinois if men persist in throwing away votes upon Mr. Fillmore.\r\nDoes some one persuade you that Mr. Fillmore can carry Illinois? Nonsense!\r\nThere are over seventy newspapers in Illinois opposing Buchanan, only\r\nthree or four of which support Mr. Fillmore, all the rest going for\r\nFremont. Are not these newspapers a fair index of the proportion of the\r\nvotes? If not, tell me why.\r\n\r\nAgain, of these three or four Fillmore newspapers, two, at least, are\r\nsupported in part by the Buchanan men, as I understand. Do not they know\r\nwhere the shoe pinches? They know the Fillmore movement helps them, and\r\ntherefore they help it. Do think these things over, and then act according\r\nto your judgment.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO Dr. R. BOAL.\r\n\r\nSept. 14, 1856.\r\n\r\nDr. R. BOAL, Lacon, Ill.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 8th inviting me to be with [you] at Lacon on\r\nthe 30th is received. I feel that I owe you and our friends of Marshall a\r\ngood deal, and I will come if I can; and if I do not get there, it will be\r\nbecause I shall think my efforts are now needed farther south.\r\n\r\nPresent my regards to Mrs. Boal, and believe [me], as ever,\r\n\r\nYour friend,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HENRY O'CONNER, MUSCATINE, IOWA.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Sept. 14, 1856.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Yours, inviting me to attend a mass-meeting on the 23d inst.,\r\nis received. It would be very pleasant to strike hands with the Fremonters\r\nof Iowa, who have led the van so splendidly, in this grand charge which\r\nwe hope and believe will end in a most glorious victory. All thanks, all\r\nhonor to Iowa! But Iowa is out of all danger, and it is no time for us,\r\nwhen the battle still rages, to pay holiday visits to Iowa. I am sure you\r\nwill excuse me for remaining in Illinois, where much hard work is still to\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER THE DEMOCRATIC VICTORY OF BUCHANAN\r\n\r\nFRAGMENT OF SPEECH AT A REPUBLICAN BANQUET IN CHICAGO, DECEMBER 10, 1856.\r\n\r\nWe have another annual Presidential message. Like a rejected lover making\r\nmerry at the wedding of his rival, the President felicitates himself\r\nhugely over the late Presidential election. He considers the result a\r\nsignal triumph of good principles and good men, and a very pointed rebuke\r\nof bad ones. He says the people did it. He forgets that the \"people,\" as\r\nhe complacently calls only those who voted for Buchanan, are in a minority\r\nof the whole people by about four hundred thousand votes--one full tenth\r\nof all the votes. Remembering this, he might perceive that the \"rebuke\"\r\nmay not be quite as durable as he seems to think--that the majority may\r\nnot choose to remain permanently rebuked by that minority.\r\n\r\nThe President thinks the great body of us Fremonters, being ardently\r\nattached to liberty, in the abstract, were duped by a few wicked and\r\ndesigning men. There is a slight difference of opinion on this. We think\r\nhe, being ardently attached to the hope of a second term, in the concrete,\r\nwas duped by men who had liberty every way. He is the cat's-paw. By much\r\ndragging of chestnuts from the fire for others to eat, his claws are burnt\r\noff to the gristle, and he is thrown aside as unfit for further use.\r\nAs the fool said of King Lear, when his daughters had turned him out of\r\ndoors, \"He 's a shelled peascod\" (\"That 's a sheal'd peascod\").\r\n\r\nSo far as the President charges us \"with a desire to change the domestic\r\ninstitutions of existing States,\" and of \"doing everything in our power to\r\ndeprive the Constitution and the laws of moral authority,\" for the whole\r\nparty on belief, and for myself on knowledge, I pronounce the charge an\r\nunmixed and unmitigated falsehood.\r\n\r\nOur government rests in public opinion. Whoever can change public opinion\r\ncan change the government practically just so much. Public opinion, on any\r\nsubject, always has a \"central idea,\" from which all its minor thoughts\r\nradiate. That \"central idea\" in our political public opinion at the\r\nbeginning was, and until recently has continued to be, \"the equality\r\nof men.\" And although it has always submitted patiently to whatever of\r\ninequality there seemed to be as matter of actual necessity, its constant\r\nworking has been a steady progress toward the practical equality of all\r\nmen. The late Presidential election was a struggle by one party to discard\r\nthat central idea and to substitute for it the opposite idea that slavery\r\nis right in the abstract, the workings of which as a central idea may be\r\nthe perpetuity of human slavery and its extension to all countries and\r\ncolors. Less than a year ago the Richmond Enquirer, an avowed advocate of\r\nslavery, regardless of color, in order to favor his views, invented the\r\nphrase \"State equality,\" and now the President, in his message, adopts\r\nthe Enquirer's catch-phrase, telling us the people \"have asserted the\r\nconstitutional equality of each and all of the States of the Union as\r\nStates.\" The President flatters himself that the new central idea is\r\ncompletely inaugurated; and so indeed it is, so far as the mere fact of a\r\nPresidential election can inaugurate it. To us it is left to know that the\r\nmajority of the people have not yet declared for it, and to hope that they\r\nnever will.\r\n\r\nAll of us who did not vote for Mr. Buchanan, taken together, are a\r\nmajority of four hundred thousand. But in the late contest we were divided\r\nbetween Fremont and Fillmore. Can we not come together for the future? Let\r\nevery one who really believes and is resolved that free society is not and\r\nshall not be a failure, and who can conscientiously declare that in the\r\nlast contest he has done only what he thought best--let every such one\r\nhave charity to believe that every other one can say as much. Thus let\r\nbygones be bygones; let past differences as nothing be; and with steady\r\neye on the real issue let us reinaugurate the good old \"central idea\" of\r\nthe republic. We can do it. The human heart is with us; God is with us. We\r\nshall again be able, not to declare that \"all States as States are equal,\"\r\nnor yet that \"all citizens as citizens are equal,\" but to renew the\r\nbroader, better declaration, including both these and much more, that \"all\r\nmen are created equal.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO Dr. R. BOAL.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Dec. 25, 1856.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:-When I was at Chicago two weeks ago I saw Mr. Arnold, and from\r\na remark of his I inferred he was thinking of the speakership, though\r\nI think he was not anxious about it. He seemed most anxious for harmony\r\ngenerally, and particularly that the contested seats from Peoria and\r\nMcDonough might be rightly determined. Since I came home I had a talk with\r\nCullom, one of our American representatives here, and he says he is for\r\nyou for Speaker and also that he thinks all the Americans will be for you,\r\nunless it be Gorin, of Macon, of whom he cannot speak. If you would like\r\nto be Speaker go right up and see Arnold. He is talented, a practised\r\ndebater, and, I think, would do himself more credit on the floor than in\r\nthe Speaker's seat. Go and see him; and if you think fit, show him this\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nYour friend as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1857\r\n\r\nTO JOHN E. ROSETTE. Private.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILL., February 10, 1857.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Your note about the little paragraph in the Republican was\r\nreceived yesterday, since which time I have been too unwell to notice\r\nit. I had not supposed you wrote or approved it. The whole originated\r\nin mistake. You know by the conversation with me that I thought the\r\nestablishment of the paper unfortunate, but I always expected to throw\r\nno obstacle in its way, and to patronize it to the extent of taking and\r\npaying for one copy. When the paper was brought to my house, my wife said\r\nto me, \"Now are you going to take another worthless little paper?\" I said\r\nto her evasively, \"I have not directed the paper to be left.\" From this,\r\nin my absence, she sent the message to the carrier. This is the whole\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPONSE TO A DOUGLAS SPEECH\r\n\r\nSPEECH IN SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, JUNE 26, 1857.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS:--I am here to-night partly by the invitation of some of\r\nyou, and partly by my own inclination. Two weeks ago Judge Douglas spoke\r\nhere on the several subjects of Kansas, the Dred Scott decision, and Utah.\r\nI listened to the speech at the time, and have the report of it since.\r\nIt was intended to controvert opinions which I think just, and to assail\r\n(politically, not personally) those men who, in common with me, entertain\r\nthose opinions. For this reason I wished then, and still wish, to make\r\nsome answer to it, which I now take the opportunity of doing.\r\n\r\nI begin with Utah. If it prove to be true, as is probable, that the people\r\nof Utah are in open rebellion to the United States, then Judge Douglas is\r\nin favor of repealing their territorial organization, and attaching them\r\nto the adjoining States for judicial purposes. I say, too, if they are in\r\nrebellion, they ought to be somehow coerced to obedience; and I am not now\r\nprepared to admit or deny that the Judge's mode of coercing them is not\r\nas good as any. The Republicans can fall in with it without taking back\r\nanything they have ever said. To be sure, it would be a considerable\r\nbacking down by Judge Douglas from his much-vaunted doctrine of\r\nself-government for the Territories; but this is only additional proof\r\nof what was very plain from the beginning, that that doctrine was a mere\r\ndeceitful pretense for the benefit of slavery. Those who could not\r\nsee that much in the Nebraska act itself, which forced governors, and\r\nsecretaries, and judges on the people of the Territories without their\r\nchoice or consent, could not be made to see, though one should rise from\r\nthe dead.\r\n\r\nBut in all this it is very plain the Judge evades the only question the\r\nRepublicans have ever pressed upon the Democracy in regard to Utah. That\r\nquestion the Judge well knew to be this: \"If the people of Utah peacefully\r\nform a State constitution tolerating polygamy, will the Democracy admit\r\nthem into the Union?\" There is nothing in the United States Constitution\r\nor law against polygamy; and why is it not a part of the Judge's \"sacred\r\nright of self-government\" for the people to have it, or rather to keep\r\nit, if they choose? These questions, so far as I know, the Judge never\r\nanswers. It might involve the Democracy to answer them either way, and\r\nthey go unanswered.\r\n\r\nAs to Kansas. The substance of the Judge's speech on Kansas is an effort\r\nto put the free-State men in the wrong for not voting at the election of\r\ndelegates to the constitutional convention. He says:\r\n\r\n\"There is every reason to hope and believe that the law will be fairly\r\ninterpreted and impartially executed, so as to insure to every bona fide\r\ninhabitant the free and quiet exercise of the elective franchise.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears extraordinary that Judge Douglas should make such a statement.\r\nHe knows that, by the law, no one can vote who has not been registered;\r\nand he knows that the free-State men place their refusal to vote on the\r\nground that but few of them have been registered. It is possible that this\r\nis not true, but Judge Douglas knows it is asserted to be true in letters,\r\nnewspapers, and public speeches, and borne by every mail and blown by\r\nevery breeze to the eyes and ears of the world. He knows it is boldly\r\ndeclared that the people of many whole counties, and many whole\r\nneighborhoods in others, are left unregistered; yet he does not venture\r\nto contradict the declaration, or to point out how they can vote without\r\nbeing registered; but he just slips along, not seeming to know there is\r\nany such question of fact, and complacently declares:\r\n\r\n \"There is every reason to hope and believe that the law will be\r\nfairly and impartially executed, so as to insure to every bona fide\r\ninhabitant the free and quiet exercise of the elective franchise.\"\r\n\r\nI readily agree that if all had a chance to vote they ought to have voted.\r\nIf, on the contrary, as they allege, and Judge Douglas ventures not to\r\nparticularly contradict, few only of the free-State men had a chance to\r\nvote, they were perfectly right in staying from the polls in a body.\r\n\r\nBy the way, since the Judge spoke, the Kansas election has come off. The\r\nJudge expressed his confidence that all the Democrats in Kansas would\r\ndo their duty-including \"free-State Democrats,\" of course. The returns\r\nreceived here as yet are very incomplete; but so far as they go, they\r\nindicate that only about one sixth of the registered voters have really\r\nvoted; and this, too, when not more, perhaps, than one half of the\r\nrightful voters have been registered, thus showing the thing to have\r\nbeen altogether the most exquisite farce ever enacted. I am watching with\r\nconsiderable interest to ascertain what figure \"the free-State Democrats\"\r\ncut in the concern. Of course they voted,--all Democrats do their\r\nduty,--and of course they did not vote for slave-State candidates. We soon\r\nshall know how many delegates they elected, how many candidates they had\r\npledged to a free State, and how many votes were cast for them.\r\n\r\nAllow me to barely whisper my suspicion that there were no such things in\r\nKansas as \"free-State Democrats\"--that they were altogether mythical, good\r\nonly to figure in newspapers and speeches in the free States. If there\r\nshould prove to be one real living free-State Democrat in Kansas, I\r\nsuggest that it might be well to catch him, and stuff and preserve his\r\nskin as an interesting specimen of that soon-to-be extinct variety of the\r\ngenus Democrat.\r\n\r\nAnd now as to the Dred Scott decision. That decision declares two\r\npropositions--first, that a negro cannot sue in the United States courts;\r\nand secondly, that Congress cannot prohibit slavery in the Territories. It\r\nwas made by a divided court dividing differently on the different points.\r\nJudge Douglas does not discuss the merits of the decision, and in that\r\nrespect I shall follow his example, believing I could no more improve on\r\nMcLean and Curtis than he could on Taney.\r\n\r\nHe denounces all who question the correctness of that decision, as\r\noffering violent resistance to it. But who resists it? Who has, in spite\r\nof the decision, declared Dred Scott free, and resisted the authority of\r\nhis master over him?\r\n\r\nJudicial decisions have two uses--first, to absolutely determine the case\r\ndecided, and secondly, to indicate to the public how other similar cases\r\nwill be decided when they arise. For the latter use, they are called\r\n\"precedents\" and \"authorities.\"\r\n\r\nWe believe as much as Judge Douglas (perhaps more) in obedience to, and\r\nrespect for, the judicial department of government. We think its decisions\r\non constitutional questions, when fully settled, should control not only\r\nthe particular cases decided, but the general policy of the country,\r\nsubject to be disturbed only by amendments of the Constitution as provided\r\nin that instrument itself. More than this would be revolution. But we\r\nthink the Dred Scott decision is erroneous. We know the court that made it\r\nhas often overruled its own decisions, and we shall do what we can to have\r\nit to overrule this. We offer no resistance to it.\r\n\r\nJudicial decisions are of greater or less authority as precedents\r\naccording to circumstances. That this should be so accords both with\r\ncommon sense and the customary understanding of the legal profession.\r\n\r\nIf this important decision had been made by the unanimous concurrence of\r\nthe judges, and without any apparent partisan bias, and in accordance with\r\nlegal public expectation and with the steady practice of the departments\r\nthroughout our history, and had been in no part based on assumed\r\nhistorical facts which are not really true; or, if wanting in some of\r\nthese, it had been before the court more than once, and had there been\r\naffirmed and reaffirmed through a course of years, it then might be,\r\nperhaps would be, factious, nay, even revolutionary, not to acquiesce in\r\nit as a precedent.\r\n\r\nBut when, as is true, we find it wanting in all these claims to the public\r\nconfidence, it is not resistance, it is not factious, it is not even\r\ndisrespectful, to treat it as not having yet quite established a settled\r\ndoctrine for the country. But Judge Douglas considers this view awful.\r\nHear him:\r\n\r\n\"The courts are the tribunals prescribed by the Constitution and created\r\nby the authority of the people to determine, expound, and enforce the law.\r\nHence, whoever resists the final decision of the highest judicial tribunal\r\naims a deadly blow at our whole republican system of government--a blow\r\nwhich, if successful, would place all our rights and liberties at the\r\nmercy of passion, anarchy, and violence. I repeat, therefore, that if\r\nresistance to the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, in\r\na matter like the points decided in the Dred Scott case, clearly within\r\ntheir jurisdiction as defined by the Constitution, shall be forced upon\r\nthe country as a political issue, it will become a distinct and naked\r\nissue between the friends and enemies of the Constitution--the friends and\r\nthe enemies of the supremacy of the laws.\"\r\n\r\nWhy, this same Supreme Court once decided a national bank to be\r\nconstitutional; but General Jackson, as President of the United States,\r\ndisregarded the decision, and vetoed a bill for a recharter, partly on\r\nconstitutional ground, declaring that each public functionary must support\r\nthe Constitution \"as he understands it.\" But hear the General's own words.\r\nHere they are, taken from his veto message:\r\n\r\n\"It is maintained by the advocates of the bank that its constitutionality,\r\nin all its features, ought to be considered as settled by precedent, and\r\nby the decision of the Supreme Court. To this conclusion I cannot assent.\r\nMere precedent is a dangerous source of authority, and should not be\r\nregarded as deciding questions of constitutional power, except where\r\nthe acquiescence of the people and the States can be considered as well\r\nsettled. So far from this being the case on this subject, an argument\r\nagainst the bank might be based on precedent. One Congress, in 1791,\r\ndecided in favor of a bank; another, in 1811, decided against it. One\r\nCongress, in 1815, decided against a bank; another, in 1816, decided in\r\nits favor. Prior to the present Congress, therefore, the precedents drawn\r\nfrom that course were equal. If we resort to the States, the expressions\r\nof legislative, judicial, and executive opinions against the bank have\r\nbeen probably to those in its favor as four to one. There is nothing in\r\nprecedent, therefore, which, if its authority were admitted, ought to\r\nweigh in favor of the act before me.\"\r\n\r\nI drop the quotations merely to remark that all there ever was in the way\r\nof precedent up to the Dred Scott decision, on the points therein decided,\r\nhad been against that decision. But hear General Jackson further:\r\n\r\n\"If the opinion of the Supreme Court covered the whole ground of this act,\r\nit ought not to control the coordinate authorities of this government. The\r\nCongress, the executive, and the courts must, each for itself, be guided\r\nby its own opinion of the Constitution. Each public officer who takes\r\nan oath to support the Constitution swears that he will support it as he\r\nunderstands it, and not as it is understood by others.\"\r\n\r\nAgain and again have I heard Judge Douglas denounce that bank decision and\r\napplaud General Jackson for disregarding it. It would be interesting\r\nfor him to look over his recent speech, and see how exactly his fierce\r\nphilippics against us for resisting Supreme Court decisions fall upon his\r\nown head. It will call to mind a long and fierce political war in this\r\ncountry, upon an issue which, in his own language, and, of course, in his\r\nown changeless estimation, \"was a distinct issue between the friends and\r\nthe enemies of the Constitution,\" and in which war he fought in the ranks\r\nof the enemies of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nI have said, in substance, that the Dred Scott decision was in part based\r\non assumed historical facts which were not really true, and I ought not to\r\nleave the subject without giving some reasons for saying this; I therefore\r\ngive an instance or two, which I think fully sustain me. Chief Justice\r\nTaney, in delivering the opinion of the majority of the court, insists at\r\ngreat length that negroes were no part of the people who made, or for\r\nwhom was made, the Declaration of Independence, or the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, Judge Curtis, in his dissenting opinion, shows that in\r\nfive of the then thirteen States--to wit, New Hampshire, Massachusetts,\r\nNew York, New Jersey, and North Carolina--free negroes were voters, and in\r\nproportion to their numbers had the same part in making the Constitution\r\nthat the white people had. He shows this with so much particularity as to\r\nleave no doubt of its truth; and as a sort of conclusion on that point,\r\nholds the following language:\r\n\r\n\"The Constitution was ordained and established by the people of the United\r\nStates, through the action, in each State, of those persons who were\r\nqualified by its laws to act thereon in behalf of themselves and all other\r\ncitizens of the State. In some of the States, as we have seen, colored\r\npersons were among those qualified by law to act on the subject. These\r\ncolored persons were not only included in the body of 'the people of the\r\nUnited States' by whom the Constitution was ordained and established; but\r\nin at least five of the States they had the power to act, and doubtless\r\ndid act, by their suffrages, upon the question of its adoption.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, Chief Justice Taney says:\r\n\r\n\"It is difficult at this day to realize the state of public opinion, in\r\nrelation to that unfortunate race, which prevailed in the civilized\r\nand enlightened portions of the world at the time of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, and when the Constitution of the United States was framed\r\nand adopted.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again, after quoting from the Declaration, he says:\r\n\r\n\"The general words above quoted would seem to include the whole human\r\nfamily, and if they were used in a similar instrument at this day, would\r\nbe so understood.\"\r\n\r\nIn these the Chief Justice does not directly assert, but plainly assumes\r\nas a fact, that the public estimate of the black man is more favorable now\r\nthan it was in the days of the Revolution. This assumption is a mistake.\r\nIn some trifling particulars the condition of that race has been\r\nameliorated; but as a whole, in this country, the change between then\r\nand now is decidedly the other way, and their ultimate destiny has never\r\nappeared so hopeless as in the last three or four years. In two of the\r\nfive States--New Jersey and North Carolina--that then gave the free\r\nnegro the right of voting, the right has since been taken away, and in\r\na third--New York--it has been greatly abridged; while it has not been\r\nextended, so far as I know, to a single additional State, though\r\nthe number of the States has more than doubled. In those days, as I\r\nunderstand, masters could, at their own pleasure, emancipate their slaves;\r\nbut since then such legal restraints have been made upon emancipation\r\nas to amount almost to prohibition. In those days Legislatures held the\r\nunquestioned power to abolish slavery in their respective States, but now\r\nit is becoming quite fashionable for State constitutions to withhold that\r\npower from the Legislatures. In those days, by common consent, the spread\r\nof the black man's bondage to the new countries was prohibited, but\r\nnow Congress decides that it will not continue the prohibition, and the\r\nSupreme Court decides that it could not if it would. In those days our\r\nDeclaration of Independence was held sacred by all, and thought to include\r\nall; but now, to aid in making the bondage of the negro universal and\r\neternal, it is assailed and sneered at and construed and hawked at and\r\ntorn, till, if its framers could rise from their graves, they could not at\r\nall recognize it. All the powers of earth seem rapidly combining against\r\nhim. Mammon is after him, ambition follows, philosophy follows, and the\r\ntheology of the day fast joining the cry. They have him in his prison\r\nhouse; they have searched his person, and left no prying instrument with\r\nhim. One after another they have closed the heavy iron doors upon him;\r\nand now they have him, as it were, bolted in with a lock of hundred keys,\r\nwhich can never be unlocked without the concurrence of every key--the keys\r\nin the hands of a hundred different men, and they scattered to hundred\r\ndifferent and distant places; and they stand musing as to what invention,\r\nin all the dominions of mind and matter, can be produced to make the\r\nimpossibility of his escape more complete than it is.\r\n\r\nIt is grossly incorrect to say or assume that the public estimate of the\r\nnegro is more favorable now than it was at the origin of the government.\r\n\r\nThree years and a half ago, Judge Douglas brought forward his famous\r\nNebraska Bill. The country was at once in a blaze. He scorned all\r\nopposition, and carried it through Congress. Since then he has seen\r\nhimself superseded in a Presidential nomination by one indorsing the\r\ngeneral doctrine of his measure, but at the same time standing clear\r\nof the odium of its untimely agitation and its gross breach of national\r\nfaith; and he has seen that successful rival constitutionally elected, not\r\nby the strength of friends, but by the division of adversaries, being in\r\na popular minority of nearly four hundred thousand votes. He has seen his\r\nchief aids in his own State, Shields and Richardson, politically speaking,\r\nsuccessively tried, convicted, and executed for an offence not their own\r\nbut his. And now he sees his own case standing next on the docket for\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nThere is a natural disgust in the minds of nearly all white people at the\r\nidea of an indiscriminate amalgamation of the white and black races; and\r\nJudge Douglas evidently is basing his chief hope upon the chances of his\r\nbeing able to appropriate the benefit of this disgust to himself. If he\r\ncan, by much drumming and repeating, fasten the odium of that idea upon\r\nhis adversaries, he thinks he can struggle through the storm. He therefore\r\nclings to this hope, as a drowning man to the last plank. He makes an\r\noccasion for lugging it in from the opposition to the Dred Scott decision.\r\nHe finds the Republicans insisting that the Declaration of Independence\r\nincludes all men, black as well as white, and forthwith he boldly denies\r\nthat it includes negroes at all, and proceeds to argue gravely that all\r\nwho contend it does, do so only because they want to vote, and eat,\r\nand sleep, and marry with negroes. He will have it that they cannot\r\nbe consistent else. Now I protest against the counterfeit logic which\r\nconcludes that, because I do not want a black woman for a slave I must\r\nnecessarily want her for a wife. I need not have her for either. I can\r\njust leave her alone. In some respects she certainly is not my equal;\r\nbut in her natural right to eat the bread she earns with her own hands,\r\nwithout asking leave of any one else, she is my equal and the equal of all\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Taney, in his opinion in the Dred Scott case, admits that\r\nthe language of the Declaration is broad enough to include the whole human\r\nfamily, but he and Judge Douglas argue that the authors of that instrument\r\ndid not intend to include negroes, by the fact that they did not at\r\nonce actually place them on an equality with the whites. Now this grave\r\nargument comes to just nothing at all, by the other fact that they did not\r\nat once, or ever afterward, actually place all white people on an equality\r\nwith one another. And this is the staple argument of both the Chief\r\nJustice and the Senator for doing this obvious violence to the plain,\r\nunmistakable language of the Declaration.\r\n\r\nI think the authors of that notable instrument intended to include all\r\nmen, but they did not intend to declare all men equal in all respects.\r\nThey did not mean to say all were equal in color, size, intellect, moral\r\ndevelopments, or social capacity. They defined with tolerable distinctness\r\nin what respects they did consider all men created equal--equal with\r\n\"certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the\r\npursuit of happiness.\" This they said, and this they meant. They did not\r\nmean to assert the obvious untruth that all were then actually enjoying\r\nthat equality, nor yet that they were about to confer it immediately upon\r\nthem. In fact, they had no power to confer such a boon. They meant simply\r\nto declare the right, so that enforcement of it might follow as fast as\r\ncircumstances should permit.\r\n\r\nThey meant to set up a standard maxim for free society, which should be\r\nfamiliar to all, and revered by all; constantly looked to, constantly\r\nlabored for, and, even though never perfectly attained, constantly\r\napproximated, and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its influence\r\nand augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people of all colors\r\neverywhere. The assertion that \"all men are created equal\" was of no\r\npractical use in effecting our separation from Great Britain; and it was\r\nplaced in the Declaration not for that, but for future use. Its authors\r\nmeant it to be--as thank God, it is now proving itself--stumbling-block\r\nto all those who in after times might seek to turn a free people back into\r\nthe hateful paths of despotism. They knew the proneness of prosperity to\r\nbreed tyrants, and they meant when such should reappear in this fair land\r\nand commence their vocation, they should find left for them at least one\r\nhard nut to crack.\r\n\r\nI have now briefly expressed my view of the meaning and object of that\r\npart of the Declaration of Independence which declares that \"all men are\r\ncreated equal.\"\r\n\r\nNow let us hear Judge Douglas's view of the same subject, as I find it in\r\nthe printed report of his late speech. Here it is:\r\n\r\n\"No man can vindicate the character, motives, and conduct of the signers\r\nof the Declaration of Independence, except upon the hypothesis that\r\nthey referred to the white race alone, and not to the African, when they\r\ndeclared all men to have been created equal; that they were speaking of\r\nBritish subjects on this continent being equal to British subjects\r\nborn and residing in Great Britain; that they were entitled to the same\r\ninalienable rights, and among them were enumerated life, liberty, and\r\nthe pursuit of happiness. The Declaration was adopted for the purpose of\r\njustifying the colonists in the eyes of the civilized world in withdrawing\r\ntheir allegiance from the British crown, and dissolving their connection\r\nwith the mother country.\"\r\n\r\nMy good friends, read that carefully over some leisure hour, and ponder\r\nwell upon it; see what a mere wreck--mangled ruin--it makes of our once\r\nglorious Declaration.\r\n\r\n\"They were speaking of British subjects on this continent being equal to\r\nBritish subjects born and residing in Great Britain\"! Why, according\r\nto this, not only negroes but white people outside of Great Britain and\r\nAmerica were not spoken of in that instrument. The English, Irish, and\r\nScotch, along with white Americans, were included, to be sure, but the\r\nFrench, Germans, and other white people of the world are all gone to pot\r\nalong with the Judge's inferior races!\r\n\r\nI had thought the Declaration promised something better than the condition\r\nof British subjects; but no, it only meant that we should be equal to them\r\nin their own oppressed and unequal condition. According to that, it gave\r\nno promise that, having kicked off the king and lords of Great Britain, we\r\nshould not at once be saddled with a king and lords of our own.\r\n\r\nI had thought the Declaration contemplated the progressive improvement in\r\nthe condition of all men everywhere; but no, it merely \"was adopted for\r\nthe purpose of justifying the colonists in the eyes of the civilized world\r\nin withdrawing their allegiance from the British crown, and dissolving\r\ntheir connection with the mother country.\" Why, that object having been\r\neffected some eighty years ago, the Declaration is of no practical use\r\nnow--mere rubbish--old wadding left to rot on the battlefield after the\r\nvictory is won.\r\n\r\nI understand you are preparing to celebrate the \"Fourth,\" to-morrow week.\r\nWhat for? The doings of that day had no reference to the present; and\r\nquite half of you are not even descendants of those who were referred to\r\nat that day. But I suppose you will celebrate, and will even go so far\r\nas to read the Declaration. Suppose, after you read it once in the\r\nold-fashioned way, you read it once more with Judge Douglas's version. It\r\nwill then run thus:\r\n\r\n\"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all British subjects who\r\nwere on this continent eighty-one years ago were created equal to all\r\nBritish subjects born and then residing in Great Britain.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now I appeal to all--to Democrats as well as others--are you really\r\nwilling that the Declaration shall thus be frittered away?--thus left no\r\nmore, at most, than an interesting memorial of the dead past?--thus shorn\r\nof its vitality and practical value, and left without the germ or even the\r\nsuggestion of the individual rights of man in it?\r\n\r\nBut Judge Douglas is especially horrified at the thought of the mixing\r\nof blood by the white and black races. Agreed for once--a thousand times\r\nagreed. There are white men enough to marry all the white women and black\r\nmen enough to many all the black women; and so let them be married. On\r\nthis point we fully agree with the Judge, and when he shall show that his\r\npolicy is better adapted to prevent amalgamation than ours, we shall drop\r\nours and adopt his. Let us see. In 1850 there were in the United States\r\n405,751 mulattoes. Very few of these are the offspring of whites and free\r\nblacks; nearly all have sprung from black slaves and white masters. A\r\nseparation of the races is the only perfect preventive of amalgamation;\r\nbut as an immediate separation is impossible, the next best thing is to\r\nkeep them apart where they are not already together. If white and black\r\npeople never get together in Kansas, they will never mix blood in Kansas.\r\nThat is at least one self-evident truth. A few free colored persons\r\nmay get into the free States, in any event; but their number is too\r\ninsignificant to amount to much in the way of mixing blood. In 1850 there\r\nwere in the free States 56,649 mulattoes; but for the most part they were\r\nnot born there--they came from the slave States, ready made up. In the\r\nsame year the slave States had 348,874 mulattoes, all of home production.\r\nThe proportion of free mulattoes to free blacks--the only colored classes\r\nin the free States is much greater in the slave than in the free States.\r\nIt is worthy of note, too, that among the free States those which make the\r\ncolored man the nearest equal to the white have proportionably the fewest\r\nmulattoes, the least of amalgamation. In New Hampshire, the State which\r\ngoes farthest toward equality between the races, there are just 184\r\nmulattoes, while there are in Virginia--how many do you think?--79,775,\r\nbeing 23,126 more than in all the free States together.\r\n\r\nThese statistics show that slavery is the greatest source of amalgamation,\r\nand next to it, not the elevation, but the degradation of the free\r\nblacks. Yet Judge Douglas dreads the slightest restraints on the spread\r\nof slavery, and the slightest human recognition of the negro, as tending\r\nhorribly to amalgamation!\r\n\r\nThe very Dred Scott case affords a strong test as to which party most\r\nfavors amalgamation, the Republicans or the dear Union-saving Democracy.\r\nDred Scott, his wife, and two daughters were all involved in the suit. We\r\ndesired the court to have held that they were citizens so far at least\r\nas to entitle them to a hearing as to whether they were free or not; and\r\nthen, also, that they were in fact and in law really free. Could we have\r\nhad our way, the chances of these black girls ever mixing their blood with\r\nthat of white people would have been diminished at least to the extent\r\nthat it could not have been without their consent. But Judge Douglas is\r\ndelighted to have them decided to be slaves, and not human enough to have\r\na hearing, even if they were free, and thus left subject to the forced\r\nconcubinage of their masters, and liable to become the mothers of\r\nmulattoes in spite of themselves: the very state of case that produces\r\nnine tenths of all the mulattoes all the mixing of blood in the nation.\r\n\r\nOf course, I state this case as an illustration only, not meaning to say\r\nor intimate that the master of Dred Scott and his family, or any more\r\nthan a percentage of masters generally, are inclined to exercise this\r\nparticular power which they hold over their female slaves.\r\n\r\nI have said that the separation of the races is the only perfect\r\npreventive of amalgamation. I have no right to say all the members of the\r\nRepublican party are in favor of this, nor to say that as a party they\r\nare in favor of it. There is nothing in their platform directly on the\r\nsubject. But I can say a very large proportion of its members are for it,\r\nand that the chief plank in their platform--opposition to the spread of\r\nslavery--is most favorable to that separation.\r\n\r\nSuch separation, if ever effected at all, must be effected by\r\ncolonization; and no political party, as such, is now doing anything\r\ndirectly for colonization. Party operations at present only favor or\r\nretard colonization incidentally. The enterprise is a difficult one; but\r\n\"where there is a will there is a way,\" and what colonization needs most\r\nis a hearty will. Will springs from the two elements of moral sense and\r\nself-interest. Let us be brought to believe it is morally right, and\r\nat the same time favorable to, or at least not against, our interest to\r\ntransfer the African to his native clime, and we shall find a way to do\r\nit, however great the task may be. The children of Israel, to such numbers\r\nas to include four hundred thousand fighting men, went out of Egyptian\r\nbondage in a body.\r\n\r\nHow differently the respective courses of the Democratic and Republican\r\nparties incidentally, bear on the question of forming a will--a public\r\nsentiment--for colonization, is easy to see. The Republicans inculcate,\r\nwith whatever of ability they can, that the negro is a man, that his\r\nbondage is cruelly wrong, and that the field of his oppression ought\r\nnot to be enlarged. The Democrats deny his manhood; deny, or dwarf to\r\ninsignificance, the wrong of his bondage; so far as possible crush all\r\nsympathy for him, and cultivate and excite hatred and disgust against\r\nhim; compliment themselves as Union-savers for doing so; and call\r\nthe indefinite outspreading of his bondage \"a sacred right of\r\nself-government.\"\r\n\r\nThe plainest print cannot be read through a gold eagle; and it will be\r\never hard to find many men who will send a slave to Liberia, and pay\r\nhis passage, while they can send him to a new country--Kansas, for\r\ninstance--and sell him for fifteen hundred dollars, and the rise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM GRIMES.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, August, 1857\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Yours of the 14th is received, and I am much obliged for the\r\nlegal information you give.\r\n\r\nYou can scarcely be more anxious than I that the next election in Iowa\r\nshould result in favor of the Republicans. I lost nearly all the working\r\npart of last year, giving my time to the canvass; and I am altogether\r\ntoo poor to lose two years together. I am engaged in a suit in the United\r\nStates Court at Chicago, in which the Rock Island Bridge Company is a\r\nparty. The trial is to commence on the 8th of September, and probably will\r\nlast two or three weeks. During the trial it is not improbable that\r\nall hands may come over and take a look at the bridge, and, if it were\r\npossible to make it hit right, I could then speak at Davenport. My courts\r\ngo right on without cessation till late in November. Write me again,\r\npointing out the more striking points of difference between your old and\r\nnew constitutions, and also whether Democratic and Republican party\r\nlines were drawn in the adoption of it, and which were for and which were\r\nagainst it. If, by possibility, I could get over among you it might be of\r\nsome advantage to know these things in advance.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARGUMENT IN THE ROCK ISLAND BRIDGE CASE.\r\n\r\n(From the Daily Press of Chicago, Sept. 24, 1857.)\r\n\r\nHurd et al. vs Railroad Bridge Co.\r\n\r\nUnited States Circuit Court, Hon. John McLean, Presiding Judge.\r\n\r\n13th day, Tuesday, Sept. 22, 1857.\r\n\r\nMr. A. Lincoln addressed the jury. He said he did not purpose to assail\r\nanybody, that he expected to grow earnest as he proceeded but not\r\nill-natured. \"There is some conflict of testimony in the case,\" he said,\r\n\"but one quarter of such a number of witnesses seldom agree, and even if\r\nall were on one side some discrepancy might be expected. We are to try and\r\nreconcile them, and to believe that they are not intentionally erroneous\r\nas long as we can.\" He had no prejudice, he said, against steamboats or\r\nsteamboat men nor any against St. Louis, for he supposed they went about\r\nthis matter as other people would do in their situation. \"St. Louis,\" he\r\ncontinued, \"as a commercial place may desire that this bridge should not\r\nstand, as it is adverse to her commerce, diverting a portion of it from\r\nthe river; and it may be that she supposes that the additional cost of\r\nrailroad transportation upon the productions of Iowa will force them to\r\ngo to St. Louis if this bridge is removed. The meetings in St. Louis are\r\nconnected with this case only as some witnesses are in it, and thus has\r\nsome prejudice added color to their testimony.\" The last thing that would\r\nbe pleasing to him, Mr. Lincoln said, would be to have one of these great\r\nchannels, extending almost from where it never freezes to where it never\r\nthaws, blocked up, but there is a travel from east to west whose demands\r\nare not less important than those of the river. It is growing larger and\r\nlarger, building up new countries with a rapidity never before seen in the\r\nhistory of the world. He alluded to the astonishing growth of Illinois,\r\nhaving grown within his memory to a population of a million and a half; to\r\nIowa and the other young rising communities of the Northwest.\r\n\r\n\"This current of travel,\" said he, \"has its rights as well as that of\r\nnorth and south. If the river had not the advantage in priority and\r\nlegislation we could enter into free competition with it and we could\r\nsurpass it. This particular railroad line has a great importance and the\r\nstatement of its business during a little less than a year shows this\r\nimportance. It is in evidence that from September 8, 1856, to August 8,\r\n1857, 12,586 freight cars and 74,179 passengers passed over this bridge.\r\nNavigation was closed four days short of four months last year, and\r\nduring this time while the river was of no use this road and bridge were\r\nvaluable. There is, too, a considerable portion of time when floating or\r\nthin ice makes the river useless while the bridge is as useful as ever.\r\nThis shows that this bridge must be treated with respect in this court and\r\nis not to be kicked about with contempt. The other day Judge Wead alluded\r\nto the strike of the contending interest and even a dissolution of the\r\nUnion. The proper mode for all parties in this affair is to 'live and let\r\nlive,' and then we will find a cessation of this trouble about the bridge.\r\nWhat mood were the steamboat men in when this bridge was burned? Why,\r\nthere was a shouting and ringing of bells and whistling on all the boats\r\nas it fell. It was a jubilee, a greater celebration than follows an\r\nexcited election. The first thing I will proceed to is the record of Mr.\r\nGurney and the complaint of Judge Wead that the record did not extend back\r\nover all the time from the completion of the bridge. The principal part of\r\nthe navigation after the bridge was burned passed through the span. When\r\nthe bridge was repaired and the boats were a second time confined to the\r\ndraw it was provided that this record should be kept. That is the simple\r\nhistory of that book.\r\n\r\n\"From April 19th, 1856, to May 6th--seventeen days--there were twenty\r\naccidents and all the time since then there have been but twenty hits,\r\nincluding seven accidents, so that the dangers of this place are tapering\r\noff and as the boatmen get cool the accidents get less. We may soon expect\r\nif this ratio is kept up that there will be no accidents at all.\r\n\r\n\"Judge Wead said, while admitting that the floats went straight through,\r\nthere was a difference between a float and a boat, but I do not remember\r\nthat he indulged us with an argument in support of this statement. Is it\r\nbecause there is a difference in size? Will not a small body and a large\r\none float the same way under the same influence? True a flatboat will\r\nfloat faster than an egg shell and the egg shell might be blown away by\r\nthe wind, but if under the same influence they would go the same way.\r\nLogs, floats, boards, various things the witnesses say all show the same\r\ncurrent. Then is not this test reliable? At all depths too the direction\r\nof the current is the same. A series of these floats would make a line as\r\nlong as a boat and would show any influence upon any part and all parts of\r\nthe boat.\r\n\r\n\"I will now speak of the angular position of the piers. What is the amount\r\nof the angle? The course of the river is a curve and the pier is straight.\r\nIf a line is produced from the upper end of the long pier straight with\r\nthe pier to a distance of 350 feet, and a line is drawn from a point in\r\nthe channel opposite this point to the head of the pier, Colonel Nason\r\nsays they will form an angle of twenty degrees. But the angle if measured\r\nat the pier is seven degrees; that is, we would have to move the pier\r\nseven degrees to make it exactly straight with the current. Would that\r\nmake the navigation better or worse? The witnesses of the plaintiff seem\r\nto think it was only necessary to say that the pier formed an angle with\r\nthe current and that settled the matter. Our more careful and accurate\r\nwitnesses say that, though they had been accustomed to seeing the piers\r\nplaced straight with the current, yet they could see that here the current\r\nhad been made straight by us in having made this slight angle; that the\r\nwater now runs just right, that it is straight and cannot be improved.\r\nThey think that if the pier was changed the eddy would be divided and the\r\nnavigation improved.\r\n\r\n\"I am not now going to discuss the question what is a material\r\nobstruction. We do not greatly differ about the law. The cases produced\r\nhere are, I suppose, proper to be taken into consideration by the court in\r\ninstructing a jury. Some of them I think are not exactly in point, but\r\nI am still willing to trust his honor, Judge McLean, and take his\r\ninstructions as law. What is reasonable skill and care? This is a thing\r\nof which the jury are to judge. I differ from the other side when it says\r\nthat they are bound to exercise no more care than was taken before the\r\nbuilding of the bridge. If we are allowed by the Legislature to build the\r\nbridge which will require them to do more than before, when a pilot comes\r\nalong, it is unreasonable for him to dash on heedless of this structure\r\nwhich has been legally put there. The Afton came there on the 5th and lay\r\nat Rock Island until next morning. When a boat lies up the pilot has a\r\nholiday, and would not any of these jurors have then gone around to the\r\nbridge and gotten acquainted with the place? Pilot Parker has shown here\r\nthat he does not understand the draw. I heard him say that the fall from\r\nthe head to the foot of the pier was four feet; he needs information. He\r\ncould have gone there that day and seen there was no such fall. He should\r\nhave discarded passion and the chances are that he would have had no\r\ndisaster at all. He was bound to make himself acquainted with the place.\r\n\r\n\"McCammon says that the current and the swell coming from the long pier\r\ndrove her against the long pier. In other words drove her toward the very\r\npier from which the current came! It is an absurdity, an impossibility.\r\nThe only recollection I can find for this contradiction is in a current\r\nwhich White says strikes out from the long pier and then like a ram's horn\r\nturns back, and this might have acted somehow in this manner.\r\n\r\n\"It is agreed by all that the plaintiff's boat was destroyed and that it\r\nwas destroyed upon the head of the short pier; that she moved from the\r\nchannel where she was with her bow above the head of the long pier, till\r\nshe struck the short one, swung around under the bridge and there was\r\ncrowded and destroyed.\r\n\r\n\"I shall try to prove that the average velocity of the current through the\r\ndraw with the boat in it should be five and a half miles an hour; that it\r\nis slowest at the head of the pier and swiftest at the foot of the pier.\r\nTheir lowest estimate in evidence is six miles an hour, their highest\r\ntwelve miles. This was the testimony of men who had made no experiment,\r\nonly conjecture. We have adopted the most exact means. The water runs\r\nswiftest in high water and we have taken the point of nine feet above low\r\nwater. The water when the Afton was lost was seven feet above low water,\r\nor at least a foot lower than our time. Brayton and his assistants timed\r\nthe instruments, the best instruments known in measuring currents. They\r\ntimed them under various circumstances and they found the current five\r\nmiles an hour and no more. They found that the water at the upper end ran\r\nslower than five miles; that below it was swifter than five miles, but\r\nthat the average was five miles. Shall men who have taken no care, who\r\nconjecture, some of whom speak of twenty miles an hour, be believed\r\nagainst those who have had such a favorable and well improved opportunity?\r\nThey should not even qualify the result. Several men have given their\r\nopinion as to the distance of the steamboat Carson, and I suppose if one\r\nshould go and measure that distance you would believe him in preference to\r\nall of them.\r\n\r\n\"These measurements were made when the boat was not in the draw. It has\r\nbeen ascertained what is the area of the cross section of this stream and\r\nthe area of the face of the piers, and the engineers say that the piers\r\nbeing put there will increase the current proportionally as the space\r\nis decreased. So with the boat in the draw. The depth of the channel was\r\ntwenty-two feet, the width one hundred and sixteen feet; multiply these\r\nand you have the square-feet across the water of the draw, viz.: 2552\r\nfeet. The Afton was 35 feet wide and drew 5 feet, making a fourteenth\r\nof the sum. Now, one-fourteenth of five miles is five-fourteenths of one\r\nmile--about one third of a mile--the increase of the current. We will call\r\nthe current five and a half miles per hour. The next thing I will try to\r\nprove is that the plaintiff's (?) boat had power to run six miles an hour\r\nin that current. It had been testified that she was a strong, swift boat,\r\nable to run eight miles an hour up stream in a current of four miles an\r\nhour, and fifteen miles down stream. Strike the average and you will find\r\nwhat is her average--about eleven and a half miles. Take the five and a\r\nhalf miles which is the speed of the current in the draw and it leaves the\r\npower of that boat in that draw at six miles an hour, 528 feet per minute\r\nand 8 4/5 feet to the second.\r\n\r\n\"Next I propose to show that there are no cross currents. I know their\r\nwitnesses say that there are cross currents--that, as one witness says,\r\nthere were three cross currents and two eddies; so far as mere statement,\r\nwithout experiment, and mingled with mistakes, can go, they have proved.\r\nBut can these men's testimony be compared with the nice, exact, thorough\r\nexperiments of our witnesses? Can you believe that these floats go across\r\nthe currents? It is inconceivable that they could not have discovered\r\nevery possible current. How do boats find currents that floats cannot\r\ndiscover? We assume the position then that those cross currents are not\r\nthere. My next proposition is that the Afton passed between the S. B.\r\nCarson and the Iowa shore. That is undisputed.\r\n\r\n\"Next I shall show that she struck first the short pier, then the long\r\npier, then the short one again and there she stopped.\" Mr. Lincoln then\r\ncited the testimony of eighteen witnesses on this point.\r\n\r\n\"How did the boat strike when she went in? Here is an endless variety of\r\nopinion. But ten of them say what pier she struck; three of them testify\r\nthat she struck first the short, then the long and then the short for the\r\nlast time. None of the rest substantially contradict this. I assume that\r\nthese men have got the truth because I believe it an established fact.\r\nMy next proposition is that after she struck the short and long pier and\r\nbefore she got back to the short pier the boat got right with her bow\r\nup. So says the pilot Parker--that he got her through until her starboard\r\nwheel passed the short pier. This would make her head about even with the\r\nhead of the long pier. He says her head was as high or higher than the\r\nhead of the long pier. Other witnesses confirmed this one. The final\r\nstroke was in the splash door aft the wheel. Witnesses differ, but the\r\nmajority say that she struck thus.\"\r\n\r\nCourt adjourned.\r\n\r\n\r\n14th day, Wednesday, Sept. 23, 1857.\r\n\r\nMr. A. LINCOLN resumed. He said he should conclude as soon as possible.\r\nHe said the colored map of the plaintiff which was brought in during one\r\nstage of the trial showed itself that the cross currents alleged did not\r\nexist. That the current as represented would drive an ascending boat to\r\nthe long pier but not to the short pier, as they urge. He explained from a\r\nmodel of a boat where the splash door is, just behind the wheel. The boat\r\nstruck on the lower shoulder of the short pier as she swung around in the\r\nsplash door; then as she went on around she struck the point or end of\r\nthe pier, where she rested. \"Her engineers,\" said Mr. Lincoln, \"say the\r\nstarboard wheel then was rushing around rapidly. Then the boat must have\r\nstruck the upper point of the pier so far back as not to disturb the\r\nwheel. It is forty feet from the stern of the Afton to the splash door,\r\nand thus it appears that she had but forty feet to go to clear the pier.\r\nHow was it that the Afton with all her power flanked over from the channel\r\nto the short pier without moving one foot ahead? Suppose she was in the\r\nmiddle of the draw, her wheel would have been 31 feet from the short pier.\r\nThe reason she went over thus is her starboard wheel was not working. I\r\nshall try to establish the fact that the wheel was not running and that\r\nafter she struck she went ahead strong on this same wheel. Upon the last\r\npoint the witnesses agree, that the starboard wheel was running after she\r\nstruck, and no witnesses say that it was running while she was out in the\r\ndraw flanking over.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln read from the testimonies of various witnesses to prove that\r\nthe starboard wheel was not working while the Afton was out in the stream.\r\n\r\n\"Other witnesses show that the captain said something of the machinery of\r\nthe wheel, and the inference is that he knew the wheel was not working.\r\nThe fact is undisputed that she did not move one inch ahead while she was\r\nmoving this 31 feet sideways. There is evidence proving that the current\r\nthere is only five miles an hour, and the only explanation is that her\r\npower was not all used--that only one wheel was working. The pilot says\r\nhe ordered the engineers to back her up. The engineers differ from him\r\nand said they kept on going ahead. The bow was so swung that the current\r\npressed it over; the pilot pressed the stern over with the rudder, though\r\nnot so fast but that the bow gained on it, and only one wheel being\r\nin motion the boat nearly stood still so far as motion up and down is\r\nconcerned, and thus she was thrown upon this pier. The Afton came into the\r\ndraw after she had just passed the Carson, and as the Carson no doubt kept\r\nthe true course the Afton going around her got out of the proper way, got\r\nacross the current into the eddy which is west of a straight line drawn\r\ndown from the long pier, was compelled to resort to these changes of\r\nwheels, which she did not do with sufficient adroitness to save her. Was\r\nit not her own fault that she entered wrong, so far wrong that she never\r\ngot right? Is the defence to blame for that?\r\n\r\n\"For several days we were entertained with depositions about boats\r\n'smelling a bar.' Why did the Afton then, after she had come up smelling\r\nso close to the long pier sheer off so strangely. When she got to the\r\ncentre of the very nose she was smelling she seemed suddenly to have lost\r\nher sense of smell and to have flanked over to the short pier.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln said there was no practicability in the project of building\r\na tunnel under the river, for there \"is not a tunnel that is a successful\r\nproject in this world. A suspension bridge cannot be built so high but\r\nthat the chimneys of the boats will grow up till they cannot pass. The\r\nsteamboat men will take pains to make them grow. The cars of a railroad\r\ncannot without immense expense rise high enough to get even with a\r\nsuspension bridge or go low enough to get through a tunnel; such expense\r\nis unreasonable.\r\n\r\n\"The plaintiffs have to establish that the bridge is a material\r\nobstruction and that they have managed their boat with reasonable care and\r\nskill. As to the last point high winds have nothing to do with it, for it\r\nwas not a windy day. They must show due skill and care. Difficulties going\r\ndown stream will not do, for they were going up stream. Difficulties\r\nwith barges in tow have nothing to do with the accident, for they had no\r\nbarge.\" Mr. Lincoln said he had much more to say, many things he could\r\nsuggest to the jury, but he wished to close to save time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JESSE K. DUBOIS.\r\n\r\nDEAR DUBOIS:\r\n\r\nBLOOMINGTON, Dec. 19, 1857.\r\n\r\nJ. M. Douglas of the I. C. R. R. Co. is here and will carry this letter.\r\nHe says they have a large sum (near $90,000) which they will pay into the\r\ntreasury now, if they have an assurance that they shall not be sued\r\nbefore Jan., 1859--otherwise not. I really wish you could consent to this.\r\nDouglas says they cannot pay more, and I believe him.\r\n\r\nI do not write this as a lawyer seeking an advantage for a client; but\r\nonly as a friend, only urging you to do what I think I would do if I were\r\nin your situation. I mean this as private and confidential only, but I\r\nfeel a good deal of anxiety about it.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH GILLESPIE.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Jan. 19, 1858.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR: This morning Col. McClernand showed me a petition for a\r\nmandamus against the Secretary of State to compel him to certify the\r\napportionment act of last session; and he says it will be presented to the\r\ncourt to-morrow morning. We shall be allowed three or four days to get up\r\na return, and I, for one, want the benefit of consultation with you.\r\n\r\nPlease come right up.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. GILLESPIE.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Feb 7, 1858\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR: Yesterday morning the court overruled the demurrer to Hatches\r\nreturn in the mandamus case. McClernand was present; said nothing about\r\npleading over; and so I suppose the matter is ended.\r\n\r\nThe court gave no reason for the decision; but Peck tells me\r\nconfidentially that they were unanimous in the opinion that even if the\r\nGov'r had signed the bill purposely, he had the right to scratch his name\r\noff so long as the bill remained in his custody and control.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO H. C. WHITNEY.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, December 18, 1857.\r\n\r\nHENRY C. WHITNEY, ESQ.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--Coming home from Bloomington last night I found your letter\r\nof the 15th.\r\n\r\nI know of no express statute or decisions as to what a J. P. upon the\r\nexpiration of his term shall do with his docket books, papers, unfinished\r\nbusiness, etc., but so far as I know, the practice has been to hand over\r\nto the successor, and to cease to do anything further whatever, in perfect\r\nanalogy to Sections 110 and 112, and I have supposed and do suppose this\r\nis the law. I think the successor may forthwith do whatever the retiring\r\nJ. P. might have done. As to the proviso to Section 114 I think it was put\r\nin to cover possible cases, by way of caution, and not to authorize the J.\r\nP. to go forward and finish up whatever might have been begun by him.\r\n\r\nThe view I take, I believe, is the Common law principle, as to retiring\r\nofficers and their successors, to which I remember but one exception,\r\nwhich is the case of Sheriff and ministerial officers of that class.\r\n\r\nI have not had time to examine this subject fully, but I have great\r\nconfidence I am right. You must not think of offering me pay for this.\r\n\r\nMr. John O. Johnson is my friend; I gave your name to him. He is doing the\r\nwork of trying to get up a Republican organization. I do not suppose \"Long\r\nJohn\" ever saw or heard of him. Let me say to you confidentially, that I\r\ndo not entirely appreciate what the Republican papers of Chicago are\r\nso constantly saying against \"Long John.\" I consider those papers truly\r\ndevoted to the Republican cause, and not unfriendly to me; but I do think\r\nthat more of what they say against \"Long John\" is dictated by personal\r\nmalice than themselves are conscious of. We can not afford to lose the\r\nservices of \"Long John\" and I do believe the unrelenting warfare made upon\r\nhim is injuring our cause. I mean this to be confidential.\r\n\r\nIf you quietly co-operate with Mr. J. O. Johnson on getting up an\r\norganization, I think it will be right.\r\n\r\nYour friend as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1858\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER POLITICAL PATRONAGE REFERENCE\r\n\r\nTO EDWARD G. MINER.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, Feb.19, 1858.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\nMr. G. A. Sutton is an applicant for superintendent of the addition of the\r\nInsane Asylum, and I understand it partly depends on you whether he gets\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSutton is my fellow-townsman and friend, and I therefore wish to say for\r\nhim that he is a man of sterling integrity and as a master mechanic and\r\nbuilder not surpassed by any in our city, or any I have known anywhere, as\r\nfar as I can judge. I hope you will consider me as being really interested\r\nfor Mr. Sutton and not as writing merely to relieve myself of importunity.\r\nPlease show this to Col. William Ross and let him consider it as much\r\nintended for him as for yourself.\r\n\r\nYour friend as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL COMMUNICATION\r\n\r\nTO W. H. LAMON, ESQ.\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, JUNE 11, 1858\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Yours of the 9th written at Joliet is just received. Two or\r\nthree days ago I learned that McLean had appointed delegates in favor\r\nof Lovejoy, and thenceforward I have considered his renomination a fixed\r\nfact. My opinion--if my opinion is of any consequence in this case, in\r\nwhich it is no business of mine to interfere--remains unchanged, that\r\nrunning an independent candidate against Lovejoy will not do; that it will\r\nresult in nothing but disaster all round. In the first place, whosoever\r\nso runs will be beaten and will be spotted for life; in the second place,\r\nwhile the race is in progress, he will be under the strongest temptation\r\nto trade with the Democrats, and to favor the election of certain of their\r\nfriends to the Legislature; thirdly, I shall be held responsible for it,\r\nand Republican members of the Legislature who are partial to Lovejoy will\r\nfor that purpose oppose us; and lastly, it will in the end lose us the\r\ndistrict altogether. There is no safe way but a convention; and if in that\r\nconvention, upon a common platform which all are willing to stand upon,\r\none who has been known as an abolitionist, but who is now occupying none\r\nbut common ground, can get the majority of the votes to which all look for\r\nan election, there is no safe way but to submit.\r\n\r\nAs to the inclination of some Republicans to favor Douglas, that is one of\r\nthe chances I have to run, and which I intend to run with patience.\r\n\r\nI write in the court room. Court has opened, and I must close.\r\n\r\nYours as ever,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIEF AUTOBIOGRAPHY,\r\n\r\nJUNE 15, 1858.\r\n\r\nThe compiler of the Dictionary of Congress states that while preparing\r\nthat work for publication, in 1858, he sent to Mr. Lincoln the usual\r\nrequest for a sketch of his life, and received the following reply:\r\n\r\n   Born February 12, 1809, in Hardin County, Kentucky.\r\n   Education, defective.\r\n   Profession, a lawyer.\r\n   Have been a captain of volunteers in Black Hawk war.\r\n   Postmaster at a very small office.\r\n   Four times a member of the Illinois Legislature and was\r\n   a member of the lower house of Congress.\r\n\r\nYours, etc.,\r\n\r\nA. LINCOLN.",
