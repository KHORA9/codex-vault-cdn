One does not\r\nsettle down very readily at two and forty to a new way of living, and\r\nI have found myself with the teeming interests of the life I have\r\nabandoned still buzzing like a swarm of homeless bees in my head. My\r\nmind has been full of confused protests and justifications. In any case\r\nI should have found difficulties enough in expressing the complex thing\r\nI have to tell, but it has added greatly to my trouble that I have a\r\ngreat analogue, that a certain Niccolo Machiavelli chanced to fall out\r\nof politics at very much the age I have reached, and wrote a book to\r\nengage the restlessness of his mind, very much as I have wanted to do.\r\nHe wrote about the relation of the great constructive spirit in politics\r\nto individual character and weaknesses, and so far his achievement lies\r\nlike a deep rut in the road of my intention. It has taken me far astray.\r\nIt is a matter of many weeks now--diversified indeed by some long drives\r\ninto the mountains behind us and a memorable sail to Genoa across the\r\nblue and purple waters that drowned Shelley--since I began a laboured\r\nand futile imitation of “The Prince.” I sat up late last night with the\r\njumbled accumulation; and at last made a little fire of olive twigs and\r\nburnt it all, sheet by sheet--to begin again clear this morning.\r\n\r\nBut incidentally I have re-read most of Machiavelli, not excepting those\r\nscandalous letters of his to Vettori, and it seems to me, now that I\r\nhave released myself altogether from his literary precedent, that he\r\nstill has his use for me. In spite of his vast prestige I claim kindred\r\nwith him and set his name upon my title-page, in partial intimation of\r\nthe matter of my story. He takes me with sympathy not only by reason\r\nof the dream he pursued and the humanity of his politics, but by the\r\nmixture of his nature. His vices come in, essential to my issue. He is\r\ndead and gone, all his immediate correlations to party and faction have\r\nfaded to insignificance, leaving only on the one hand his broad method\r\nand conceptions, and upon the other his intimate living personality,\r\nexposed down to its salacious corners as the soul of no contemporary can\r\never be exposed. Of those double strands it is I have to write, of the\r\nsubtle protesting perplexing play of instinctive passion and desire\r\nagainst too abstract a dream of statesmanship. But things that seemed to\r\nlie very far apart in Machiavelli's time have come near to one another;\r\nit is no simple story of white passions struggling against the red that\r\nI have to tell.\r\n\r\nThe state-making dream is a very old dream indeed in the world's\r\nhistory. It plays too small a part in novels. Plato and Confucius\r\nare but the highest of a great host of minds that have had a kindred\r\naspiration, have dreamt of a world of men better ordered, happier,\r\nfiner, securer. They imagined cities grown more powerful and peoples\r\nmade rich and multitudinous by their efforts, they thought in terms\r\nof harbours and shining navies, great roads engineered marvellously,\r\njungles cleared and deserts conquered, the ending of muddle and\r\ndiseases and dirt and misery; the ending of confusions that waste human\r\npossibilities; they thought of these things with passion and desire as\r\nother men think of the soft lines and tender beauty of women. Thousands\r\nof men there are to-day almost mastered by this white passion of\r\nstatecraft, and in nearly every one who reads and thinks you could find,\r\nI suspect, some sort of answering response. But in every one it presents\r\nitself extraordinarily entangled and mixed up with other, more intimate\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nIt was so with Machiavelli. I picture him at San Casciano as he lived\r\nin retirement upon his property after the fall of the Republic, perhaps\r\nwith a twinge of the torture that punished his conspiracy still lurking\r\nin his limbs. Such twinges could not stop his dreaming. Then it was “The\r\nPrince” was written. All day he went about his personal affairs,\r\nsaw homely neighbours, dealt with his family, gave vent to everyday\r\npassions. He would sit in the shop of Donato del Corno gossiping\r\ncuriously among vicious company, or pace the lonely woods of his estate,\r\nbook in hand, full of bitter meditations. In the evening he returned\r\nhome and went to his study. At the entrance, he says, he pulled off his\r\npeasant clothes covered with the dust and dirt of that immediate life,\r\nwashed himself, put on his “noble court dress,” closed the door on\r\nthe world of toiling and getting, private loving, private hating and\r\npersonal regrets, sat down with a sigh of contentment to those wider\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\nI like to think of him so, with brown books before him lit by the light\r\nof candles in silver candlesticks, or heading some new chapter of “The\r\nPrince,” with a grey quill in his clean fine hand.\r\n\r\nSo writing, he becomes a symbol for me, and the less none because of his\r\nanimal humour, his queer indecent side, and because of such lapses\r\ninto utter meanness as that which made him sound the note of the\r\nbegging-letter writer even in his “Dedication,” reminding His\r\nMagnificence very urgently, as if it were the gist of his matter, of the\r\ncontinued malignity of fortune in his affairs. These flaws complete him.\r\nThey are my reason for preferring him as a symbol to Plato, of whose\r\nindelicate side we know nothing, and whose correspondence with Dionysius\r\nof Syracuse has perished; or to Confucius who travelled China in search\r\nof a Prince he might instruct, with lapses and indignities now lost\r\nin the mists of ages. They have achieved the apotheosis of individual\r\nforgetfulness, and Plato has the added glory of that acquired beauty,\r\nthat bust of the Indian Bacchus which is now indissolubly mingled with\r\nhis tradition. They have passed into the world of the ideal, and every\r\nhumbug takes his freedoms with their names. But Machiavelli, more recent\r\nand less popular, is still all human and earthly, a fallen brother--and\r\nat the same time that nobly dressed and nobly dreaming writer at the\r\ndesk.\r\n\r\nThat vision of the strengthened and perfected state is protagonist in\r\nmy story. But as I re-read “The Prince” and thought out the manner of\r\nmy now abandoned project, I came to perceive how that stir and whirl of\r\nhuman thought one calls by way of embodiment the French Revolution, has\r\naltered absolutely the approach to such a question. Machiavelli, like\r\nPlato and Pythagoras and Confucius two hundred odd decades before him,\r\nsaw only one method by which a thinking man, himself not powerful, might\r\ndo the work of state building, and that was by seizing the imagination\r\nof a Prince. Directly these men turned their thoughts towards\r\nrealisation, their attitudes became--what shall I call it?--secretarial.\r\nMachiavelli, it is true, had some little doubts about the particular\r\nPrince he wanted, whether it was Caesar Borgia of Giuliano or Lorenzo,\r\nbut a Prince it had to be. Before I saw clearly the differences of our\r\nown time I searched my mind for the modern equivalent of a Prince. At\r\nvarious times I redrafted a parallel dedication to the Prince of\r\nWales, to the Emperor William, to Mr. Evesham, to a certain newspaper\r\nproprietor who was once my schoolfellow at City Merchants', to Mr. J. D.\r\nRockefeller--all of them men in their several ways and circumstances and\r\npossibilities, princely. Yet in every case my pen bent of its own accord\r\ntowards irony because--because, although at first I did not realise it,\r\nI myself am just as free to be a prince. The appeal was unfair. The old\r\nsort of Prince, the old little principality has vanished from the world.\r\nThe commonweal is one man's absolute estate and responsibility no more.\r\nIn Machiavelli's time it was indeed to an extreme degree one man's\r\naffair. But the days of the Prince who planned and directed and was\r\nthe source and centre of all power are ended. We are in a condition of\r\naffairs infinitely more complex, in which every prince and statesman is\r\nsomething of a servant and every intelligent human being something of\r\na Prince. No magnificent pensive Lorenzos remain any more in this world\r\nfor secretarial hopes.\r\n\r\nIn a sense it is wonderful how power has vanished, in a sense wonderful\r\nhow it has increased. I sit here, an unarmed discredited man, at a small\r\nwriting-table in a little defenceless dwelling among the vines, and no\r\nhuman being can stop my pen except by the deliberate self-immolation of\r\nmurdering me, nor destroy its fruits except by theft and crime. No King,\r\nno council, can seize and torture me; no Church, no nation silence me.\r\nSuch powers of ruthless and complete suppression have vanished. But that\r\nis not because power has diminished, but because it has increased and\r\nbecome multitudinous, because it has dispersed itself and specialised.\r\nIt is no longer a negative power we have, but positive; we cannot\r\nprevent, but we can do. This age, far beyond all previous ages, is full\r\nof powerful men, men who might, if they had the will for it, achieve\r\nstupendous things.\r\n\r\nThe things that might be done to-day! The things indeed that are being\r\ndone! It is the latter that give one so vast a sense of the former. When\r\nI think of the progress of physical and mechanical science, of medicine\r\nand sanitation during the last century, when I measure the increase in\r\ngeneral education and average efficiency, the power now available\r\nfor human service, the merely physical increment, and compare it with\r\nanything that has ever been at man's disposal before, and when I think\r\nof what a little straggling, incidental, undisciplined and uncoordinated\r\nminority of inventors, experimenters, educators, writers and organisers\r\nhas achieved this development of human possibilities, achieved it in\r\nspite of the disregard and aimlessness of the huge majority, and the\r\npassionate resistance of the active dull, my imagination grows giddy\r\nwith dazzling intimations of the human splendours the justly organised\r\nstate may yet attain. I glimpse for a bewildering instant the heights\r\nthat may be scaled, the splendid enterprises made possible.\r\n\r\nBut the appeal goes out now in other forms, in a book that catches at\r\nthousands of readers for the eye of a Prince diffused. It is the\r\nold appeal indeed for the unification of human effort, the ending of\r\nconfusions, but instead of the Machiavellian deference to a flattered\r\nlord, a man cries out of his heart to the unseen fellowship about him.\r\nThe last written dedication of all those I burnt last night, was to no\r\nsingle man, but to the socially constructive passion--in any man....\r\n\r\nThere is, moreover, a second great difference in kind between my world\r\nand Machiavelli's. We are discovering women. It is as if they had come\r\nacross a vast interval since his time, into the very chamber of the\r\nstatesman.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nIn Machiavelli's outlook the interest of womanhood was in a region of\r\nlife almost infinitely remote from his statecraft. They were the vehicle\r\nof children, but only Imperial Rome and the new world of to-day have\r\never had an inkling of the significance that might give them in the\r\nstate. They did their work, he thought, as the ploughed earth bears its\r\ncrops. Apart from their function of fertility they gave a humorous twist\r\nto life, stimulated worthy men to toil, and wasted the hours of Princes.\r\nHe left the thought of women outside with his other dusty things when\r\nhe went into his study to write, dismissed them from his mind. But\r\nour modern world is burthened with its sense of the immense, now half\r\narticulate, significance of women. They stand now, as it were, close\r\nbeside the silver candlesticks, speaking as Machiavelli writes, until he\r\nstays his pen and turns to discuss his writing with them.\r\n\r\nIt is this gradual discovery of sex as a thing collectively portentous\r\nthat I have to mingle with my statecraft if my picture is to be true\r\nwhich has turned me at length from a treatise to the telling of my own\r\nstory. In my life I have paralleled very closely the slow realisations\r\nthat are going on in the world about me. I began life ignoring women,\r\nthey came to me at first perplexing and dishonouring; only very slowly\r\nand very late in my life and after misadventure, did I gauge the power\r\nand beauty of the love of man and woman and learnt how it must needs\r\nframe a justifiable vision of the ordered world. Love has brought me\r\nto disaster, because my career had been planned regardless of its\r\npossibility and value. But Machiavelli, it seems to me, when he\r\nwent into his study, left not only the earth of life outside but its\r\nunsuspected soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nLike Machiavelli at San Casciano, if I may take this analogy one step\r\nfurther, I too am an exile. Office and leading are closed to me. The\r\npolitical career that promised so much for me is shattered and ended for\r\never.\r\n\r\nI look out from this vine-wreathed veranda under the branches of a stone\r\npine; I see wide and far across a purple valley whose sides are terraced\r\nand set with houses of pine and ivory, the Gulf of Liguria gleaming\r\nsapphire blue, and cloud-like baseless mountains hanging in the sky, and\r\nI think of lank and coaly steamships heaving on the grey rollers of the\r\nEnglish Channel and darkling streets wet with rain, I recall as if I\r\nwere back there the busy exit from Charing Cross, the cross and the\r\nmoney-changers' offices, the splendid grime of giant London and the\r\ncrowds going perpetually to and fro, the lights by night and the urgency\r\nand eventfulness of that great rain-swept heart of the modern world.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to think we have left that--for many years if not for\r\never. In thought I walk once more in Palace Yard and hear the clink and\r\nclatter of hansoms and the quick quiet whirr of motors; I go in vivid\r\nrecent memories through the stir in the lobbies, I sit again at eventful\r\ndinners in those old dining-rooms like cellars below the House--dinners\r\nthat ended with shrill division bells, I think of huge clubs swarming\r\nand excited by the bulletins of that electoral battle that was for me\r\nthe opening opportunity. I see the stencilled names and numbers go up on\r\nthe green baize, constituency after constituency, amidst murmurs or loud\r\nshouting....\r\n\r\nIt is over for me now and vanished. That opportunity will come no more.\r\nVery probably you have heard already some crude inaccurate version of\r\nour story and why I did not take office, and have formed your partial\r\njudgement on me. And so it is I sit now at my stone table, half out of\r\nlife already, in a warm, large, shadowy leisure, splashed with sunlight\r\nand hung with vine tendrils, with paper before me to distil such wisdom\r\nas I can, as Machiavelli in his exile sought to do, from the things I\r\nhave learnt and felt during the career that has ended now in my divorce.\r\n\r\nI climbed high and fast from small beginnings. I had the mind of my\r\nparty. I do not know where I might not have ended, but for this red\r\nblaze that came out of my unguarded nature and closed my career for\r\never.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE SECOND ~~ BROMSTEAD AND MY FATHER\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nI dreamt first of states and cities and political things when I was a\r\nlittle boy in knickerbockers.\r\n\r\nWhen I think of how such things began in my mind, there comes back to me\r\nthe memory of an enormous bleak room with its ceiling going up to heaven\r\nand its floor covered irregularly with patched and defective oilcloth\r\nand a dingy mat or so and a “surround” as they call it, of dark stained\r\nwood. Here and there against the wall are trunks and boxes. There are\r\ncupboards on either side of the fireplace and bookshelves with\r\nbooks above them, and on the wall and rather tattered is a large\r\nyellow-varnished geological map of the South of England. Over the mantel\r\nis a huge lump of white coral rock and several big fossil bones, and\r\nabove that hangs the portrait of a brainy gentleman, sliced in half and\r\ndisplaying an interior of intricate detail and much vigour of coloring.\r\nIt is the floor I think of chiefly; over the oilcloth of which, assumed\r\nto be land, spread towns and villages and forts of wooden bricks; there\r\nare steep square hills (geologically, volumes of Orr's CYCLOPAEDIA OF\r\nTHE SCIENCES) and the cracks and spaces of the floor and the bare brown\r\nsurround were the water channels and open sea of that continent of mine.\r\n\r\nI still remember with infinite gratitude the great-uncle to whom I\r\nowe my bricks. He must have been one of those rare adults who have not\r\nforgotten the chagrins and dreams of childhood. He was a prosperous west\r\nof England builder; including my father he had three nephews, and for\r\neach of them he caused a box of bricks to be made by an out-of-work\r\ncarpenter, not the insufficient supply of the toyshop, you understand,\r\nbut a really adequate quantity of bricks made out of oak and shaped\r\nand smoothed, bricks about five inches by two and a half by one, and\r\nhalf-bricks and quarter-bricks to correspond. There were hundreds of\r\nthem, many hundreds. I could build six towers as high as myself with\r\nthem, and there seemed quite enough for every engineering project I\r\ncould undertake. I could build whole towns with streets and houses and\r\nchurches and citadels; I could bridge every gap in the oilcloth and make\r\ncauseways over crumpled spaces (which I feigned to be morasses), and on\r\na keel of whole bricks it was possible to construct ships to push\r\nover the high seas to the remotest port in the room. And a disciplined\r\npopulation, that rose at last by sedulous begging on birthdays and\r\nall convenient occasions to well over two hundred, of lead sailors and\r\nsoldiers, horse, foot and artillery, inhabited this world.\r\n\r\nJustice has never been done to bricks and soldiers by those who write\r\nabout toys. The praises of the toy theatre have been a common theme for\r\nessayists, the planning of the scenes, the painting and cutting out of\r\nthe caste, penny plain twopence coloured, the stink and glory of the\r\nperformance and the final conflagration. I had such a theatre once, but\r\nI never loved it nor hoped for much from it; my bricks and soldiers were\r\nmy perpetual drama. I recall an incessant variety of interests. There\r\nwas the mystery and charm of the complicated buildings one could make,\r\nwith long passages and steps and windows through which one peeped into\r\ntheir intricacies, and by means of slips of card one could make slanting\r\nways in them, and send marbles rolling from top to base and thence out\r\ninto the hold of a waiting ship. Then there were the fortresses and gun\r\nemplacements and covered ways in which one's soldiers went. And there\r\nwas commerce; the shops and markets and store-rooms full of nasturtium\r\nseed, thrift seed, lupin beans and suchlike provender from the garden;\r\nsuch stuff one stored in match-boxes and pill-boxes, or packed in sacks\r\nof old glove fingers tied up with thread and sent off by waggons along\r\nthe great military road to the beleaguered fortress on the Indian\r\nfrontier beyond the worn places that were dismal swamps. And there were\r\nbattles on the way.\r\n\r\nThat great road is still clear in my memory. I was given, I forget by\r\nwhat benefactor, certain particularly fierce red Indians of lead--I have\r\nnever seen such soldiers since--and for these my father helped me to\r\nmake tepees of brown paper, and I settled them in a hitherto desolate\r\ncountry under the frowning nail-studded cliffs of an ancient trunk. Then\r\nI conquered them and garrisoned their land. (Alas! they died, no doubt\r\nthrough contact with civilisation--one my mother trod on--and their\r\nland became a wilderness again and was ravaged for a time by a clockwork\r\ncrocodile of vast proportions.) And out towards the coal-scuttle was a\r\nregion near the impassable thickets of the ragged hearthrug where lived\r\ncertain china Zulus brandishing spears, and a mountain country of\r\nrudely piled bricks concealing the most devious and enchanting caves and\r\nseveral mines of gold and silver paper. Among these rocks a number of\r\nsurvivors from a Noah's Ark made a various, dangerous, albeit frequently\r\ninvalid and crippled fauna, and I was wont to increase the uncultivated\r\nwildness of this region further by trees of privet-twigs from the garden\r\nhedge and box from the garden borders. By these territories went\r\nmy Imperial Road carrying produce to and fro, bridging gaps in the\r\noilcloth, tunnelling through Encyclopaedic hills--one tunnel was three\r\nvolumes long--defended as occasion required by camps of paper tents\r\nor brick blockhouses, and ending at last in a magnificently engineered\r\nascent to a fortress on the cliffs commanding the Indian reservation.\r\n\r\nMy games upon the floor must have spread over several years and\r\ndeveloped from small beginnings, incorporating now this suggestion and\r\nnow that. They stretch, I suppose, from seven to eleven or twelve. I\r\nplayed them intermittently, and they bulk now in the retrospect far more\r\nsignificantly than they did at the time. I played them in bursts, and\r\nthen forgot them for long periods; through the spring and summer I was\r\nmostly out of doors, and school and classes caught me early. And in\r\nthe retrospect I see them all not only magnified and transfigured, but\r\nfore-shortened and confused together. A clockwork railway, I seem to\r\nremember, came and went; one or two clockwork boats, toy sailing ships\r\nthat, being keeled, would do nothing but lie on their beam ends on the\r\nfloor; a detestable lot of cavalrymen, undersized and gilt all over,\r\ngiven me by a maiden aunt, and very much what one might expect from\r\nan aunt, that I used as Nero used his Christians to ornament my public\r\nbuildings; and I finally melted some into fratricidal bullets, and\r\ntherewith blew the rest to flat splashes of lead by means of a brass\r\ncannon in the garden.\r\n\r\nI find this empire of the floor much more vivid and detailed in my\r\nmemory now than many of the owners of the skirts and legs and boots that\r\nwent gingerly across its territories. Occasionally, alas! they stooped\r\nto scrub, abolishing in one universal destruction the slow growth of\r\nwhole days of civilised development. I still remember the hatred and\r\ndisgust of these catastrophes. Like Noah I was given warnings. Did I\r\ndisregard them, coarse red hands would descend, plucking garrisons\r\nfrom fortresses and sailors from ships, jumbling them up in their wrong\r\nboxes, clumsily so that their rifles and swords were broken, sweeping\r\nthe splendid curves of the Imperial Road into heaps of ruins, casting\r\nthe jungle growth of Zululand into the fire.\r\n\r\n“Well, Master Dick,” the voice of this cosmic calamity would say, “you\r\nought to have put them away last night. No! I can't wait until you've\r\nsailed them all away in ships. I got my work to do, and do it I will.”\r\n\r\nAnd in no time all my continents and lands were swirling water and\r\nswiping strokes of house-flannel.\r\n\r\nThat was the worst of my giant visitants, but my mother too, dear lady,\r\nwas something of a terror to this microcosm. She wore spring-sided\r\nboots, a kind of boot now vanished, I believe, from the world, with dull\r\nbodies and shiny toes, and a silk dress with flounces that were very\r\ndestructive to the more hazardous viaducts of the Imperial Road. She\r\nwas always, I seem to remember, fetching me; fetching me for a meal,\r\nfetching me for a walk or, detestable absurdity! fetching me for a wash\r\nand brush up, and she never seemed to understand anything whatever of\r\nthe political systems across which she came to me. Also she forbade all\r\ntoys on Sundays except the bricks for church-building and the soldiers\r\nfor church parade, or a Scriptural use of the remains of the Noah's Ark\r\nmixed up with a wooden Swiss dairy farm. But she really did not know\r\nwhether a thing was a church or not unless it positively bristled with\r\ncannon, and many a Sunday afternoon have I played Chicago (with the fear\r\nof God in my heart) under an infidel pretence that it was a new sort of\r\nark rather elaborately done.\r\n\r\nChicago, I must explain, was based upon my father's description of the\r\npig slaughterings in that city and certain pictures I had seen. You made\r\nyour beasts--which were all the ark lot really, provisionally conceived\r\nas pigs--go up elaborate approaches to a central pen, from which\r\nthey went down a cardboard slide four at a time, and dropped most\r\nsatisfyingly down a brick shaft, and pitter-litter over some steep steps\r\nto where a head slaughterman (ne Noah) strung a cotton loop round their\r\nlegs and sent them by pin hooks along a wire to a second slaughterman\r\nwith a chipped foot (formerly Mrs. Noah) who, if I remember rightly,\r\nconverted them into Army sausage by means of a portion of the inside of\r\nan old alarum clock.\r\n\r\nMy mother did not understand my games, but my father did. He wore\r\nbright-coloured socks and carpet slippers when he was indoors--my mother\r\ndisliked boots in the house--and he would sit down on my little chair\r\nand survey the microcosm on the floor with admirable understanding and\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\nIt was he who gave me most of my toys and, I more than suspect, most\r\nof my ideas. “Here's some corrugated iron,” he would say, “suitable for\r\nroofs and fencing,” and hand me a lump of that stiff crinkled paper that\r\nis used for packing medicine bottles. Or, “Dick, do you see the tiger\r\nloose near the Imperial Road?--won't do for your cattle ranch.” And I\r\nwould find a bright new lead tiger like a special creation at large in\r\nthe world, and demanding a hunting expedition and much elaborate effort\r\nto get him safely housed in the city menagerie beside the captured\r\ndragon crocodile, tamed now, and his key lost and the heart and spring\r\ngone out of him.\r\n\r\nAnd to the various irregular reading of my father I owe the inestimable\r\nblessing of never having a boy's book in my boyhood except those of\r\nJules Verne. But my father used to get books for himself and me from\r\nthe Bromstead Institute, Fenimore Cooper and Mayne Reid and illustrated\r\nhistories; one of the Russo-Turkish war and one of Napier's expedition\r\nto Abyssinia I read from end to end; Stanley and Livingstone, lives\r\nof Wellington, Napoleon and Garibaldi, and back volumes of PUNCH, from\r\nwhich I derived conceptions of foreign and domestic politics it has\r\ntaken years of adult reflection to correct. And at home permanently we\r\nhad Wood's NATURAL HISTORY, a brand-new illustrated Green's HISTORY OF\r\nTHE ENGLISH PEOPLE, Irving's COMPANIONS OF COLUMBUS, a great number\r\nof unbound parts of some geographical work, a VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD I\r\nthink it was called, with pictures of foreign places, and Clarke's NEW\r\nTESTAMENT with a map of Palestine, and a variety of other informing\r\nbooks bought at sales. There was a Sowerby's BOTANY also, with thousands\r\nof carefully tinted pictures of British plants, and one or two other\r\nimportant works in the sitting-room. I was allowed to turn these over\r\nand even lie on the floor with them on Sundays and other occasions of\r\nexceptional cleanliness.\r\n\r\nAnd in the attic I found one day a very old forgotten map after the\r\nfashion of a bird's-eye view, representing the Crimea, that fascinated\r\nme and kept me for hours navigating its waters with a pin.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nMy father was a lank-limbed man in easy shabby tweed clothes and with\r\nhis hands in his trouser pockets. He was a science teacher, taking\r\na number of classes at the Bromstead Institute in Kent under the old\r\nScience and Art Department, and “visiting” various schools; and our\r\nresources were eked out by my mother's income of nearly a hundred\r\npounds a year, and by his inheritance of a terrace of three palatial but\r\nstructurally unsound stucco houses near Bromstead Station.\r\n\r\nThey were big clumsy residences in the earliest Victorian style,\r\ninterminably high and with deep damp basements and downstairs\r\ncoal-cellars and kitchens that suggested an architect vindictively\r\ndevoted to the discomfort of the servant class. If so, he had\r\noverreached himself and defeated his end, for no servant would stay\r\nin them unless for exceptional wages or exceptional tolerance of\r\ninefficiency or exceptional freedom in repartee. Every storey in the\r\nhouse was from twelve to fifteen feet high (which would have been cool\r\nand pleasant in a hot climate), and the stairs went steeply up, to end\r\nat last in attics too inaccessible for occupation. The ceilings had vast\r\nplaster cornices of classical design, fragments of which would sometimes\r\nfall unexpectedly, and the wall-papers were bold and gigantic in pattern\r\nand much variegated by damp and ill-mended rents.\r\n\r\nAs my father was quite unable to let more than one of these houses at a\r\ntime, and that for the most part to eccentric and undesirable tenants,\r\nhe thought it politic to live in one of the two others, and devote the\r\nrent he received from the let one, when it was let, to the incessant\r\nnecessary repairing of all three. He also did some of the repairing\r\nhimself and, smoking a bull-dog pipe the while, which my mother would\r\nnot allow him to do in the house, he cultivated vegetables in a sketchy,\r\nunpunctual and not always successful manner in the unoccupied gardens.\r\nThe three houses faced north, and the back of the one we occupied was\r\ncovered by a grape-vine that yielded, I remember, small green grapes\r\nfor pies in the spring, and imperfectly ripe black grapes in favourable\r\nautumns for the purposes of dessert. The grape-vine played an important\r\npart in my life, for my father broke his neck while he was pruning it,\r\nwhen I was thirteen.\r\n\r\nMy father was what is called a man of ideas, but they were not always\r\ngood ideas. My grandfather had been a private schoolmaster and one of\r\nthe founders of the College of Preceptors, and my father had assisted\r\nhim in his school until increasing competition and diminishing\r\nattendance had made it evident that the days of small private schools\r\nkept by unqualified persons were numbered. Thereupon my father had\r\nroused himself and had qualified as a science teacher under the Science\r\nand Art Department, which in these days had charge of the scientific and\r\nartistic education of the mass of the English population, and had thrown\r\nhimself into science teaching and the earning of government grants\r\ntherefor with great if transitory zeal and success.\r\n\r\nI do not remember anything of my father's earlier and more energetic\r\ntime. I was the child of my parents' middle years; they married when my\r\nfather was thirty-five and my mother past forty, and I saw only the last\r\ndecadent phase of his educational career.\r\n\r\nThe Science and Art Department has vanished altogether from the\r\nworld, and people are forgetting it now with the utmost readiness and\r\ngenerosity. Part of its substance and staff and spirit survive, more or\r\nless completely digested into the Board of Education.\r\n\r\nThe world does move on, even in its government. It is wonderful how many\r\nof the clumsy and limited governing bodies of my youth and early manhood\r\nhave given place now to more scientific and efficient machinery. When\r\nI was a boy, Bromstead, which is now a borough, was ruled by a strange\r\nbody called a Local Board--it was the Age of Boards--and I still\r\nremember indistinctly my father rejoicing at the breakfast-table over\r\nthe liberation of London from the corrupt and devastating control of a\r\nMetropolitan Board of Works. Then there were also School Boards; I\r\nwas already practically in politics before the London School Board was\r\nabsorbed by the spreading tentacles of the London County Council.\r\n\r\nIt gives a measure of the newness of our modern ideas of the State to\r\nremember that the very beginnings of public education lie within my\r\nfather's lifetime, and that many most intelligent and patriotic people\r\nwere shocked beyond measure at the State doing anything of the sort.\r\nWhen he was born, totally illiterate people who could neither read a\r\nbook nor write more than perhaps a clumsy signature, were to be found\r\neverywhere in England; and great masses of the population were getting\r\nno instruction at all. Only a few schools flourished upon the patronage\r\nof exceptional parents; all over the country the old endowed grammar\r\nschools were to be found sinking and dwindling; many of them had\r\nclosed altogether. In the new great centres of population multitudes of\r\nchildren were sweated in the factories, darkly ignorant and wretched\r\nand the under-equipped and under-staffed National and British schools,\r\nsupported by voluntary contributions and sectarian rivalries, made an\r\nineffectual fight against this festering darkness. It was a condition\r\nof affairs clamouring for remedies, but there was an immense amount\r\nof indifference and prejudice to be overcome before any remedies were\r\npossible. Perhaps some day some industrious and lucid historian\r\nwill disentangle all the muddle of impulses and antagonisms, the\r\ncommercialism, utilitarianism, obstinate conservatism, humanitarian\r\nenthusiasm, out of which our present educational organisation arose.\r\nI have long since come to believe it necessary that all new social\r\ninstitutions should be born in confusion, and that at first they should\r\npresent chiefly crude and ridiculous aspects. The distrust of government\r\nin the Victorian days was far too great, and the general intelligence\r\nfar too low, to permit the State to go about the new business it was\r\ntaking up in a businesslike way, to train teachers, build and equip\r\nschools, endow pedagogic research, and provide properly written\r\nschool-books. These things it was felt MUST be provided by individual\r\nand local effort, and since it was manifest that it was individual\r\nand local effort that were in default, it was reluctantly agreed to\r\nstimulate them by money payments. The State set up a machinery of\r\nexamination both in Science and Art and for the elementary schools; and\r\npayments, known technically as grants, were made in accordance with the\r\nexamination results attained, to such schools as Providence might see\r\nfit to send into the world. In this way it was felt the Demand would\r\nbe established that would, according to the beliefs of that time,\r\ninevitably ensure the Supply. An industry of “Grant earning” was\r\ncreated, and this would give education as a necessary by-product.\r\n\r\nIn the end this belief was found to need qualification, but\r\nGrant-earning was still in full activity when I was a small boy. So far\r\nas the Science and Art Department and my father are concerned, the task\r\nof examination was entrusted to eminent scientific men, for the most\r\npart quite unaccustomed to teaching. You see, if they also were teaching\r\nsimilar classes to those they examined, it was feared that injustice\r\nmight be done. Year after year these eminent persons set questions\r\nand employed subordinates to read and mark the increasing thousands of\r\nanswers that ensued, and having no doubt the national ideal of fairness\r\nwell developed in their minds, they were careful each year to re-read\r\nthe preceding papers before composing the current one, in order to see\r\nwhat it was usual to ask. As a result of this, in the course of a\r\nfew years the recurrence and permutation of questions became almost\r\ncalculable, and since the practical object of the teaching was to teach\r\npeople not science, but how to write answers to these questions, the\r\nindustry of Grant-earning assumed a form easily distinguished from any\r\nkind of genuine education whatever.\r\n\r\nOther remarkable compromises had also to be made with the spirit of the\r\nage. The unfortunate conflict between Religion and Science prevalent at\r\nthis time was mitigated, if I remember rightly, by making graduates in\r\narts and priests in the established church Science Teachers EX OFFICIO,\r\nand leaving local and private enterprise to provide schools, diagrams,\r\nbooks, material, according to the conceptions of efficiency prevalent in\r\nthe district. Private enterprise made a particularly good thing of the\r\nbooks. A number of competing firms of publishers sprang into existence\r\nspecialising in Science and Art Department work; they set themselves to\r\nproduce text-books that should supply exactly the quantity and quality\r\nof knowledge necessary for every stage of each of five and twenty\r\nsubjects into which desirable science was divided, and copies and models\r\nand instructions that should give precisely the method and gestures\r\nesteemed as proficiency in art. Every section of each book was written\r\nin the idiom found to be most satisfactory to the examiners, and test\r\nquestions extracted from papers set in former years were appended to\r\nevery chapter. By means of these last the teacher was able to train his\r\nclass to the very highest level of grant-earning efficiency, and very\r\nnaturally he cast all other methods of exposition aside. First he posed\r\nhis pupils with questions and then dictated model replies.\r\n\r\nThat was my father's method of instruction. I attended his classes as an\r\nelementary grant-earner from the age of ten until his death, and it is\r\nso I remember him, sitting on the edge of a table, smothering a yawn\r\noccasionally and giving out the infallible formulae to the industriously\r\nscribbling class sitting in rows of desks before him. Occasionally he\r\nwould slide to his feet and go to a blackboard on an easel and draw on\r\nthat very slowly and deliberately in coloured chalks a diagram for the\r\nclass to copy in coloured pencils, and sometimes he would display a\r\nspecimen or arrange an experiment for them to see. The room in the\r\nInstitute in which he taught was equipped with a certain amount of\r\napparatus prescribed as necessary for subject this and subject that by\r\nthe Science and Art Department, and this my father would supplement with\r\nmaps and diagrams and drawings of his own.\r\n\r\nBut he never really did experiments, except that in the class in\r\nsystematic botany he sometimes made us tease common flowers to pieces.\r\nHe did not do experiments if he could possibly help it, because in the\r\nfirst place they used up time and gas for the Bunsen burner and good\r\nmaterial in a ruinous fashion, and in the second they were, in his\r\nrather careless and sketchy hands, apt to endanger the apparatus of\r\nthe Institute and even the lives of his students. Then thirdly, real\r\nexperiments involved washing up. And moreover they always turned out\r\nwrong, and sometimes misled the too observant learner very seriously\r\nand opened demoralising controversies. Quite early in life I acquired an\r\nalmost ineradicable sense of the unscientific perversity of Nature and\r\nthe impassable gulf that is fixed between systematic science and elusive\r\nfact. I knew, for example, that in science, whether it be subject XII.,\r\nOrganic Chemistry, or subject XVII., Animal Physiology, when you blow\r\ninto a glass of lime-water it instantly becomes cloudy, and if you\r\ncontinue to blow it clears again, whereas in truth you may blow into the\r\nstuff from the lime-water bottle until you are crimson in the face and\r\npainful under the ears, and it never becomes cloudy at all. And I knew,\r\ntoo, that in science if you put potassium chlorate into a retort and\r\nheat it over a Bunsen burner, oxygen is disengaged and may be collected\r\nover water, whereas in real life if you do anything of the sort the\r\nvessel cracks with a loud report, the potassium chlorate descends\r\nsizzling upon the flame, the experimenter says “Oh! Damn!” with\r\nastonishing heartiness and distinctness, and a lady student in the back\r\nseats gets up and leaves the room.\r\n\r\nScience is the organised conquest of Nature, and I can quite understand\r\nthat ancient libertine refusing to co-operate in her own undoing. And I\r\ncan quite understand, too, my father's preference for what he called\r\nan illustrative experiment, which was simply an arrangement of the\r\napparatus in front of the class with nothing whatever by way of\r\nmaterial, and the Bunsen burner clean and cool, and then a slow luminous\r\ndescription of just what you did put in it when you were so ill-advised\r\nas to carry the affair beyond illustration, and just exactly what ought\r\nanyhow to happen when you did. He had considerable powers of vivid\r\nexpression, so that in this way he could make us see all he described.\r\nThe class, freed from any unpleasant nervous tension, could draw this\r\nstill life without flinching, and if any part was too difficult to draw,\r\nthen my father would produce a simplified version on the blackboard\r\nto be copied instead. And he would also write on the blackboard any\r\nexceptionally difficult but grant-earning words, such as “empyreumatic”\r\n or “botryoidal.”\r\n\r\nSome words in constant use he rarely explained. I remember once sticking\r\nup my hand and asking him in the full flow of description, “Please, sir,\r\nwhat is flocculent?”\r\n\r\n“The precipitate is.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, but what does it mean?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! flocculent!” said my father, “flocculent! Why--” he extended his\r\nhand and arm and twiddled his fingers for a second in the air. “Like\r\nthat,” he said.\r\n\r\nI thought the explanation sufficient, but he paused for a moment after\r\ngiving it. “As in a flock bed, you know,” he added and resumed his\r\ndiscourse.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nMy father, I am afraid, carried a natural incompetence in practical\r\naffairs to an exceptionally high level. He combined practical\r\nincompetence, practical enterprise and a thoroughly sanguine\r\ntemperament, in a manner that I have never seen paralleled in any human\r\nbeing. He was always trying to do new things in the briskest manner,\r\nunder the suggestion of books or papers or his own spontaneous\r\nimagination, and as he had never been trained to do anything whatever\r\nin his life properly, his futilities were extensive and thorough. At one\r\ntime he nearly gave up his classes for intensive culture, so enamoured\r\nwas he of its possibilities; the peculiar pungency of the manure he got,\r\nin pursuit of a chemical theory of his own, has scarred my olfactory\r\nmemories for a lifetime. The intensive culture phase is very clear in my\r\nmemory; it came near the end of his career and when I was between eleven\r\nand twelve. I was mobilised to gather caterpillars on several occasions,\r\nand assisted in nocturnal raids upon the slugs by lantern-light that\r\nwrecked my preparation work for school next day. My father dug up both\r\nlawns, and trenched and manured in spasms of immense vigour alternating\r\nwith periods of paralysing distaste for the garden. And for weeks he\r\ntalked about eight hundred pounds an acre at every meal.\r\n\r\nA garden, even when it is not exasperated by intensive methods, is a\r\nthing as exacting as a baby, its moods have to be watched; it does\r\nnot wait upon the cultivator's convenience, but has times of its own.\r\nIntensive culture greatly increases this disposition to trouble mankind;\r\nit makes a garden touchy and hysterical, a drugged and demoralised and\r\nover-irritated garden. My father got at cross purposes with our two\r\npatches at an early stage. Everything grew wrong from the first to last,\r\nand if my father's manures intensified nothing else, they certainly\r\nintensified the Primordial Curse. The peas were eaten in the night\r\nbefore they were three inches high, the beans bore nothing but blight,\r\nthe only apparent result of a spraying of the potatoes was to develop\r\na PENCHANT in the cat for being ill indoors, the cucumber frames were\r\ndamaged by the catapulting of boys going down the lane at the back,\r\nand all your cucumbers were mysteriously embittered. That lane with its\r\noccasional passers-by did much to wreck the intensive scheme, because my\r\nfather always stopped work and went indoors if any one watched him.\r\nHis special manure was apt to arouse a troublesome spirit of inquiry in\r\nhardy natures.\r\n\r\nIn digging his rows and shaping his patches he neglected the guiding\r\nstring and trusted to his eye altogether too much, and the consequent\r\nobliquity and the various wind-breaks and scare-crows he erected, and\r\nparticularly an irrigation contrivance he began and never finished by\r\nwhich everything was to be watered at once by means of pieces of gutter\r\nfrom the roof and outhouses of Number 2, and a large and particularly\r\nobstinate clump of elder-bushes in the abolished hedge that he had\r\nfailed to destroy entirely either by axe or by fire, combined to give\r\nthe gardens under intensive culture a singularly desolate and disorderly\r\nappearance. He took steps towards the diversion of our house drain under\r\nthe influence of the Sewage Utilisation Society; but happily he stopped\r\nin time. He hardly completed any of the operations he began; something\r\nelse became more urgent or simply he tired; a considerable area of the\r\nNumber 2 territory was never even dug up.\r\n\r\nIn the end the affair irritated him beyond endurance. Never was a man\r\nless horticulturally-minded. The clamour of these vegetables he had\r\nlaunched into the world for his service and assistance, wore out his\r\npatience. He would walk into the garden the happiest of men after a\r\nday or so of disregard, talking to me of history perhaps or social\r\norganisation, or summarising some book he had read. He talked to me\r\nof anything that interested him, regardless of my limitations. Then he\r\nwould begin to note the growth of the weeds. “This won't do,” he would\r\nsay and pull up a handful.\r\n\r\nMore weeding would follow and the talk would become fragmentary. His\r\nhands would become earthy, his nails black, weeds would snap off in\r\nhis careless grip, leaving the roots behind. The world would darken.\r\nHe would look at his fingers with disgusted astonishment. “CURSE these\r\nweeds!” he would say from his heart. His discourse was at an end.\r\n\r\nI have memories, too, of his sudden unexpected charges into the\r\ntranquillity of the house, his hands and clothes intensively enriched.\r\nHe would come in like a whirlwind. “This damned stuff all over me and\r\nthe Agricultural Chemistry Class at six! Bah! AAAAAAH!”\r\n\r\nMy mother would never learn not to attempt to break him of swearing\r\non such occasions. She would remain standing a little stiffly in the\r\nscullery refusing to assist him to the adjectival towel he sought.\r\n\r\n“If you say such things--”\r\n\r\nHe would dance with rage and hurl the soap about. “The towel!” he would\r\ncry, flicking suds from big fingers in every direction; “the towel! I'll\r\nlet the blithering class slide if you don't give me the towel! I'll give\r\nup everything, I tell you--everything!”...\r\n\r\nAt last with the failure of the lettuces came the breaking point. I was\r\nin the little arbour learning Latin irregular verbs when it happened.\r\nI can see him still, his peculiar tenor voice still echoes in my brain,\r\nshouting his opinion of intensive culture for all the world to hear, and\r\nslashing away at that abominable mockery of a crop with a hoe. We had\r\ntied them up with bast only a week or so before, and now half were\r\nrotten and half had shot up into tall slender growths. He had the hoe in\r\nboth hands and slogged. Great wipes he made, and at each stroke he said,\r\n“Take that!”\r\n\r\nThe air was thick with flying fragments of abortive salad. It was a\r\nfantastic massacre. It was the French Revolution of that cold tyranny,\r\nthe vindictive overthrow of the pampered vegetable aristocrats. After he\r\nhad assuaged his passion upon them, he turned for other prey; he kicked\r\nholes in two of our noblest marrows, flicked off the heads of half a row\r\nof artichokes, and shied the hoe with a splendid smash into the cucumber\r\nframe. Something of the awe of that moment returns to me as I write of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“Well, my boy,” he said, approaching with an expression of beneficent\r\nhappiness, “I've done with gardening. Let's go for a walk like\r\nreasonable beings. I've had enough of this”--his face was convulsed for\r\nan instant with bitter resentment--“Pandering to cabbages.”\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nThat afternoon's walk sticks in my memory for many reasons. One is\r\nthat we went further than I had ever been before; far beyond Keston and\r\nnearly to Seven-oaks, coming back by train from Dunton Green, and the\r\nother is that my father as he went along talked about himself, not so\r\nmuch to me as to himself, and about life and what he had done with\r\nit. He monologued so that at times he produced an effect of weird\r\nworld-forgetfulness. I listened puzzled, and at that time not\r\nunderstanding many things that afterwards became plain to me. It is only\r\nin recent years that I have discovered the pathos of that monologue; how\r\nfriendless my father was and uncompanioned in his thoughts and feelings,\r\nand what a hunger he may have felt for the sympathy of the undeveloped\r\nyoungster who trotted by his side.\r\n\r\n“I'm no gardener,” he said, “I'm no anything. Why the devil did I start\r\ngardening?\r\n\r\n“I suppose man was created to mind a garden... But the Fall let us out\r\nof that! What was I created for? God! what was I created for?...\r\n\r\n“Slaves to matter! Minding inanimate things! It doesn't suit me, you\r\nknow. I've got no hands and no patience. I've mucked about with life.\r\nMucked about with life.” He suddenly addressed himself to me, and for\r\nan instant I started like an eavesdropper discovered. “Whatever you do,\r\nboy, whatever you do, make a Plan. Make a good Plan and stick to it.\r\nFind out what life is about--I never have--and set yourself to do\r\nwhatever you ought to do. I admit it's a puzzle....\r\n\r\n“Those damned houses have been the curse of my life. Stucco white\r\nelephants! Beastly cracked stucco with stains of green--black and green.\r\nConferva and soot.... Property, they are!... Beware of Things, Dick,\r\nbeware of Things! Before you know where you are you are waiting on them\r\nand minding them. They'll eat your life up. Eat up your hours and your\r\nblood and energy! When those houses came to me, I ought to have\r\nsold them--or fled the country. I ought to have cleared out.\r\nSarcophagi--eaters of men! Oh! the hours and days of work, the nights\r\nof anxiety those vile houses have cost me! The painting! It worked up\r\nmy arms; it got all over me. I stank of it. It made me ill. It isn't\r\nliving--it's minding....\r\n\r\n“Property's the curse of life. Property! Ugh! Look at this country all\r\ncut up into silly little parallelograms, look at all those villas we\r\npassed just now and those potato patches and that tarred shanty and the\r\nhedge! Somebody's minding every bit of it like a dog tied to a cart's\r\ntail. Patching it and bothering about it. Bothering! Yapping at every\r\npasser-by. Look at that notice-board! One rotten worried little beast\r\nwants to keep us other rotten little beasts off HIS patch,--God knows\r\nwhy! Look at the weeds in it. Look at the mended fence!... There's no\r\nproperty worth having, Dick, but money. That's only good to spend.\r\nAll these things. Human souls buried under a cartload of blithering\r\nrubbish....\r\n\r\n“I'm not a fool, Dick. I have qualities, imagination, a sort of go. I\r\nought to have made a better thing of life.\r\n\r\n“I'm sure I could have done things. Only the old people pulled my leg.\r\nThey started me wrong. They never started me at all. I only began to\r\nfind out what life was like when I was nearly forty.\r\n\r\n“If I'd gone to a university; if I'd had any sort of sound training, if\r\nI hadn't slipped into the haphazard places that came easiest....\r\n\r\n“Nobody warned me. Nobody. It isn't a world we live in, Dick; it's a\r\ncascade of accidents; it's a chaos exasperated by policemen! YOU be\r\nwarned in time, Dick. You stick to a plan. Don't wait for any one to\r\nshow you the way. Nobody will. There isn't a way till you make one. Get\r\neducation, get a good education. Fight your way to the top. It's your\r\nonly chance. I've watched you. You'll do no good at digging and property\r\nminding. There isn't a neighbour in Bromstead won't be able to skin you\r\nat suchlike games. You and I are the brainy unstable kind, topside or\r\nnothing. And if ever those blithering houses come to you--don't have\r\n'em. Give them away! Dynamite 'em--and off! LIVE, Dick! I'll get rid of\r\nthem for you if I can, Dick, but remember what I say.”...\r\n\r\nSo it was my father discoursed, if not in those particular words, yet\r\nexactly in that manner, as he slouched along the southward road, with\r\nresentful eyes becoming less resentful as he talked, and flinging out\r\nclumsy illustrative motions at the outskirts of Bromstead as we passed\r\nalong them. That afternoon he hated Bromstead, from its foot-tiring\r\npebbles up. He had no illusions about Bromstead or himself. I have\r\nthe clearest impression of him in his garden-stained tweeds with a\r\ndeer-stalker hat on the back of his head and presently a pipe sometimes\r\nbetween his teeth and sometimes in his gesticulating hand, as he became\r\ndiverted by his talk from his original exasperation....\r\n\r\nThis particular afternoon is no doubt mixed up in my memory with\r\nmany other afternoons; all sorts of things my father said and did at\r\ndifferent times have got themselves referred to it; it filled me at the\r\ntime with a great unprecedented sense of fellowship and it has become\r\nthe symbol now for all our intercourse together. If I didn't understand\r\nthe things he said, I did the mood he was in. He gave me two very broad\r\nideas in that talk and the talks I have mingled with it; he gave them\r\nto me very clearly and they have remained fundamental in my mind; one a\r\nsense of the extraordinary confusion and waste and planlessness of the\r\nhuman life that went on all about us; and the other of a great ideal of\r\norder and economy which he called variously Science and Civilisation,\r\nand which, though I do not remember that he ever used that word, I\r\nsuppose many people nowadays would identify with Socialism,--as the\r\nFabians expound it.\r\n\r\nHe was not very definite about this Science, you must understand, but\r\nhe seemed always to be waving his hand towards it,--just as his\r\ncontemporary Tennyson seems always to be doing--he belonged to his age\r\nand mostly his talk was destructive of the limited beliefs of his time,\r\nhe led me to infer rather than actually told me that this Science was\r\ncoming, a spirit of light and order, to the rescue of a world groaning\r\nand travailing in muddle for the want of it....\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nWhen I think of Bromstead nowadays I find it inseparably bound up\r\nwith the disorders of my father's gardening, and the odd patchings and\r\npaintings that disfigured his houses. It was all of a piece with that.\r\n\r\nLet me try and give something of the quality of Bromstead and something\r\nof its history. It is the quality and history of a thousand places\r\nround and about London, and round and about the other great centres of\r\npopulation in the world. Indeed it is in a measure the quality of\r\nthe whole of this modern world from which we who have the statesman's\r\npassion struggle to evolve, and dream still of evolving order.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, you must think of Bromstead a hundred and fifty years ago,\r\nas a narrow irregular little street of thatched houses strung out on\r\nthe London and Dover Road, a little mellow sample unit of a social order\r\nthat had a kind of completeness, at its level, of its own. At that\r\ntime its population numbered a little under two thousand people, mostly\r\nengaged in agricultural work or in trades serving agriculture. There was\r\na blacksmith, a saddler, a chemist, a doctor, a barber, a linen-draper\r\n(who brewed his own beer); a veterinary surgeon, a hardware shop,\r\nand two capacious inns. Round and about it were a number of pleasant\r\ngentlemen's seats, whose owners went frequently to London town in their\r\ncoaches along the very tolerable high-road. The church was big enough\r\nto hold the whole population, were people minded to go to church, and\r\nindeed a large proportion did go, and all who married were married in\r\nit, and everybody, to begin with, was christened at its font and buried\r\nat last in its yew-shaded graveyard. Everybody knew everybody in the\r\nplace. It was, in fact, a definite place and a real human community in\r\nthose days. There was a pleasant old market-house in the middle of the\r\ntown with a weekly market, and an annual fair at which much cheerful\r\nmerry making and homely intoxication occurred; there was a pack of\r\nhounds which hunted within five miles of London Bridge, and the local\r\ngentry would occasionally enliven the place with valiant cricket matches\r\nfor a hundred guineas a side, to the vast excitement of the entire\r\npopulation. It was very much the same sort of place that it had been for\r\nthree or four centuries. A Bromstead Rip van Winkle from 1550 returning\r\nin 1750 would have found most of the old houses still as he had known\r\nthem, the same trades a little improved and differentiated one from the\r\nother, the same roads rather more carefully tended, the Inns not very\r\nmuch altered, the ancient familiar market-house. The occasional wheeled\r\ntraffic would have struck him as the most remarkable difference, next\r\nperhaps to the swaggering painted stone monuments instead of brasses\r\nand the protestant severity of the communion-table in the parish\r\nchurch,--both from the material point of view very little things. A\r\nRip van Winkle from 1350, again, would have noticed scarcely greater\r\nchanges; fewer clergy, more people, and particularly more people of\r\nthe middling sort; the glass in the windows of many of the houses, the\r\nstylish chimneys springing up everywhere would have impressed him, and\r\nsuchlike details. The place would have had the same boundaries, the same\r\nbroad essential features, would have been still itself in the way that\r\na man is still himself after he has “filled out” a little and grown a\r\nlonger beard and changed his clothes.\r\n\r\nBut after 1750 something got hold of the world, something that was\r\ndestined to alter the scale of every human affair.\r\n\r\nThat something was machinery and a vague energetic disposition to\r\nimprove material things. In another part of England ingenious people\r\nwere beginning to use coal in smelting iron, and were producing metal\r\nin abundance and metal castings in sizes that had hitherto been\r\nunattainable. Without warning or preparation, increment involving\r\ncountless possibilities of further increment was coming to the strength\r\nof horses and men. “Power,” all unsuspected, was flowing like a drug\r\ninto the veins of the social body.\r\n\r\nNobody seems to have perceived this coming of power, and nobody had\r\ncalculated its probable consequences. Suddenly, almost inadvertently,\r\npeople found themselves doing things that would have amazed their\r\nancestors. They began to construct wheeled vehicles much more easily and\r\ncheaply than they had ever done before, to make up roads and move things\r\nabout that had formerly been esteemed too heavy for locomotion, to join\r\nwoodwork with iron nails instead of wooden pegs, to achieve all sorts\r\nof mechanical possibilities, to trade more freely and manufacture on a\r\nlarger scale, to send goods abroad in a wholesale and systematic way,\r\nto bring back commodities from overseas, not simply spices and fine\r\ncommodities, but goods in bulk. The new influence spread to agriculture,\r\niron appliances replaced wooden, breeding of stock became systematic,\r\npaper-making and printing increased and cheapened. Roofs of slate and\r\ntile appeared amidst and presently prevailed over the original Bromstead\r\nthatch, the huge space of Common to the south was extensively enclosed,\r\nand what had been an ill-defined horse-track to Dover, only passable\r\nby adventurous coaches in dry weather, became the Dover Road, and was\r\npresently the route first of one and then of several daily coaches.\r\nThe High Street was discovered to be too tortuous for these awakening\r\nenergies, and a new road cut off its worst contortions. Residential\r\nvillas appeared occupied by retired tradesmen and widows, who esteemed\r\nthe place healthy, and by others of a strange new unoccupied class of\r\npeople who had money invested in joint-stock enterprises. First one\r\nand then several boys' boarding-schools came, drawing their pupils from\r\nLondon,--my grandfather's was one of these. London, twelve miles to the\r\nnorth-west, was making itself felt more and more.\r\n\r\nBut this was only the beginning of the growth period, the first trickle\r\nof the coming flood of mechanical power. Away in the north they were\r\ncasting iron in bigger and bigger forms, working their way to the\r\nproduction of steel on a large scale, applying power in factories.\r\nBromstead had almost doubted in size again long before the railway came;\r\nthere was hardly any thatch left in the High Street, but instead were\r\nhouses with handsome brass-knockered front doors and several windows,\r\nand shops with shop-fronts all of square glass panes, and the place was\r\nlighted publicly now by oil lamps--previously only one flickering lamp\r\noutside each of the coaching inns had broken the nocturnal darkness.\r\nAnd there was talk, it long remained talk,--of gas. The gasworks came in\r\n1834, and about that date my father's three houses must have been built\r\nconvenient for the London Road. They mark nearly the beginning of the\r\nreal suburban quality; they were let at first to City people still\r\nengaged in business.\r\n\r\nAnd then hard on the gasworks had come the railway and cheap coal; there\r\nwas a wild outbreak of brickfields upon the claylands to the east, and\r\nthe Great Growth had begun in earnest. The agricultural placidities that\r\nhad formerly come to the very borders of the High Street were broken up\r\nnorth, west and south, by new roads. This enterprising person and then\r\nthat began to “run up” houses, irrespective of every other enterprising\r\nperson who was doing the same thing. A Local Board came into existence,\r\nand with much hesitation and penny-wise economy inaugurated drainage\r\nworks. Rates became a common topic, a fact of accumulating importance.\r\nSeveral chapels of zinc and iron appeared, and also a white new church\r\nin commercial Gothic upon the common, and another of red brick in the\r\nresidential district out beyond the brickfields towards Chessington.\r\n\r\nThe population doubled again and doubled again, and became particularly\r\nteeming in the prolific “working-class” district about the deep-rutted,\r\nmuddy, coal-blackened roads between the gasworks, Blodgett's laundries,\r\nand the railway goods-yard. Weekly properties, that is to say small\r\nhouses built by small property owners and let by the week, sprang up\r\nalso in the Cage Fields, and presently extended right up the London\r\nRoad. A single national school in an inconvenient situation set itself\r\ninadequately to collect subscriptions and teach the swarming, sniffing,\r\ngrimy offspring of this dingy new population to read. The villages of\r\nBeckington, which used to be three miles to the west, and Blamely four\r\nmiles to the east of Bromstead, were experiencing similar distensions\r\nand proliferations, and grew out to meet us. All effect of locality or\r\ncommunity had gone from these places long before I was born; hardly any\r\none knew any one; there was no general meeting place any more, the old\r\nfairs were just common nuisances haunted by gypsies, van showmen, Cheap\r\nJacks and London roughs, the churches were incapable of a quarter of the\r\npopulation. One or two local papers of shameless veniality reported the\r\nproceedings of the local Bench and the local Board, compelled tradesmen\r\nwho were interested in these affairs to advertise, used the epithet\r\n“Bromstedian” as one expressing peculiar virtues, and so maintained in\r\nthe general mind a weak tradition of some local quality that embraced\r\nus all. Then the parish graveyard filled up and became a scandal, and\r\nan ambitious area with an air of appetite was walled in by a Bromstead\r\nCemetery Company, and planted with suitably high-minded and sorrowful\r\nvarieties of conifer. A stonemason took one of the earlier villas with\r\na front garden at the end of the High Street, and displayed a supply\r\nof urns on pillars and headstones and crosses in stone, marble, and\r\ngranite, that would have sufficed to commemorate in elaborate detail the\r\nentire population of Bromstead as one found it in 1750.\r\n\r\nThe cemetery was made when I was a little boy of five or six; I was in\r\nthe full tide of building and growth from the first; the second railway\r\nwith its station at Bromstead North and the drainage followed when I was\r\nten or eleven, and all my childish memories are of digging and wheeling,\r\nof woods invaded by building, roads gashed open and littered with iron\r\npipes amidst a fearful smell of gas, of men peeped at and seen toiling\r\naway deep down in excavations, of hedges broken down and replaced by\r\nplanks, of wheelbarrows and builders' sheds, of rivulets overtaken and\r\nswallowed up by drain-pipes. Big trees, and especially elms, cleared\r\nof undergrowth and left standing amid such things, acquired a peculiar\r\ntattered dinginess rather in the quality of needy widow women who have\r\nseen happier days.\r\n\r\nThe Ravensbrook of my earlier memories was a beautiful stream. It came\r\ninto my world out of a mysterious Beyond, out of a garden, splashing\r\nbrightly down a weir which had once been the weir of a mill. (Above the\r\nweir and inaccessible there were bulrushes growing in splendid clumps,\r\nand beyond that, pampas grass, yellow and crimson spikes of hollyhock,\r\nand blue suggestions of wonderland.) From the pool at the foot of\r\nthis initial cascade it flowed in a leisurely fashion beside a\r\nfootpath,--there were two pretty thatched cottages on the left, and here\r\nwere ducks, and there were willows on the right,--and so came to where\r\ngreat trees grew on high banks on either hand and bowed closer, and at\r\nlast met overhead. This part was difficult to reach because of an old\r\nfence, but a little boy might glimpse that long cavern of greenery by\r\nwading. Either I have actually seen kingfishers there, or my father has\r\ndescribed them so accurately to me that he inserted them into my\r\nmemory. I remember them there anyhow. Most of that overhung part I never\r\npenetrated at all, but followed the field path with my mother and met\r\nthe stream again, where beyond there were flat meadows, Roper's meadows.\r\nThe Ravensbrook went meandering across the middle of these, now between\r\nsteep banks, and now with wide shallows at the bends where the cattle\r\nwaded and drank. Yellow and purple loose-strife and ordinary rushes grew\r\nin clumps along the bank, and now and then a willow. On rare occasions\r\nof rapture one might see a rat cleaning his whiskers at the water's\r\nedge. The deep places were rich with tangled weeds, and in them fishes\r\nlurked--to me they were big fishes--water-boatmen and water-beetles\r\ntraversed the calm surface of these still deeps; in one pool were yellow\r\nlilies and water-soldiers, and in the shoaly places hovering fleets of\r\nsmall fry basked in the sunshine--to vanish in a flash at one's shadow.\r\nIn one place, too, were Rapids, where the stream woke with a start from\r\na dreamless brooding into foaming panic and babbled and hastened. Well\r\ndo I remember that half-mile of rivulet; all other rivers and cascades\r\nhave their reference to it for me. And after I was eleven, and before we\r\nleft Bromstead, all the delight and beauty of it was destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe volume of its water decreased abruptly--I suppose the new drainage\r\nworks that linked us up with Beckington, and made me first acquainted\r\nwith the geological quality of the London clay, had to do with\r\nthat--until only a weak uncleansing trickle remained. That at first\r\ndid not strike me as a misfortune. An adventurous small boy might walk\r\ndryshod in places hitherto inaccessible. But hard upon that came the\r\npegs, the planks and carts and devastation. Roper's meadows, being no\r\nlonger in fear of floods, were now to be slashed out into parallelograms\r\nof untidy road, and built upon with rows of working-class cottages. The\r\nroads came,--horribly; the houses followed. They seemed to rise in\r\nthe night. People moved into them as soon as the roofs were on, mostly\r\nworkmen and their young wives, and already in a year some of these raw\r\nhouses stood empty again from defaulting tenants, with windows broken\r\nand wood-work warping and rotting. The Ravensbrook became a dump for\r\nold iron, rusty cans, abandoned boots and the like, and was a river\r\nonly when unusual rains filled it for a day or so with an inky flood of\r\nsurface water....\r\n\r\nThat indeed was my most striking perception in the growth of Bromstead.\r\nThe Ravensbrook had been important to my imaginative life; that way\r\nhad always been my first choice in all my walks with my mother, and its\r\nrapid swamping by the new urban growth made it indicative of all the\r\nother things that had happened just before my time, or were still, at a\r\nless dramatic pace, happening. I realised that building was the enemy.\r\nI began to understand why in every direction out of Bromstead one walked\r\npast scaffold-poles into litter, why fragments of broken brick and\r\ncinder mingled in every path, and the significance of the universal\r\nnotice-boards, either white and new or a year old and torn and battered,\r\npromising sites, proffering houses to be sold or let, abusing and\r\nintimidating passers-by for fancied trespass, and protecting rights of\r\nway.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to disentangle now what I understood at this time and\r\nwhat I have since come to understand, but it seems to me that even\r\nin those childish days I was acutely aware of an invading and growing\r\ndisorder. The serene rhythms of the old established agriculture, I see\r\nnow, were everywhere being replaced by cultivation under notice and\r\nsnatch crops; hedges ceased to be repaired, and were replaced by cheap\r\niron railings or chunks of corrugated iron; more and more hoardings\r\nsprang up, and contributed more and more to the nomad tribes of filthy\r\npaper scraps that flew before the wind and overspread the country.\r\nThe outskirts of Bromstead were a maze of exploitation roads that\r\nled nowhere, that ended in tarred fences studded with nails (I don't\r\nremember barbed wire in those days; I think the Zeitgeist did not\r\nproduce that until later), and in trespass boards that used vehement\r\nlanguage. Broken glass, tin cans, and ashes and paper abounded. Cheap\r\nglass, cheap tin, abundant fuel, and a free untaxed Press had rushed\r\nupon a world quite unprepared to dispose of these blessings when the\r\nfulness of enjoyment was past.\r\n\r\nI suppose one might have persuaded oneself that all this was but the\r\nreplacement of an ancient tranquillity, or at least an ancient balance,\r\nby a new order. Only to my eyes, quickened by my father's intimations,\r\nit was manifestly no order at all. It was a multitude of incoordinated\r\nfresh starts, each more sweeping and destructive than the last, and none\r\nof them ever really worked out to a ripe and satisfactory completion.\r\nEach left a legacy of products, houses, humanity, or what not, in its\r\nwake. It was a sort of progress that had bolted; it was change out of\r\nhand, and going at an unprecedented pace nowhere in particular.\r\n\r\nNo, the Victorian epoch was not the dawn of a new era; it was a hasty,\r\ntrial experiment, a gigantic experiment of the most slovenly and\r\nwasteful kind. I suppose it was necessary; I suppose all things are\r\nnecessary. I suppose that before men will discipline themselves to learn\r\nand plan, they must first see in a hundred convincing forms the folly\r\nand muddle that come from headlong, aimless and haphazard methods.\r\nThe nineteenth century was an age of demonstrations, some of them very\r\nimpressive demonstrations, of the powers that have come to mankind, but\r\nof permanent achievement, what will our descendants cherish? It is hard\r\nto estimate what grains of precious metal may not be found in a mud\r\ntorrent of human production on so large a scale, but will any one, a\r\nhundred years from now, consent to live in the houses the Victorians\r\nbuilt, travel by their roads or railways, value the furnishings they\r\nmade to live among or esteem, except for curious or historical reasons,\r\ntheir prevalent art and the clipped and limited literature that\r\nsatisfied their souls?\r\n\r\nThat age which bore me was indeed a world full of restricted and\r\nundisciplined people, overtaken by power, by possessions and great\r\nnew freedoms, and unable to make any civilised use of them whatever;\r\nstricken now by this idea and now by that, tempted first by one\r\npossession and then another to ill-considered attempts; it was my\r\nfather's exploitation of his villa gardens on the wholesale level. The\r\nwhole of Bromstead as I remember it, and as I saw it last--it is a year\r\nago now--is a dull useless boiling-up of human activities, an immense\r\nclustering of futilities. It is as unfinished as ever; the builders'\r\nroads still run out and end in mid-field in their old fashion; the\r\nvarious enterprises jumble in the same hopeless contradiction, if\r\nanything intensified. Pretentious villas jostle slums, and public-house\r\nand tin tabernacle glower at one another across the cat-haunted lot that\r\nintervenes. Roper's meadows are now quite frankly a slum; back doors and\r\nsculleries gape towards the railway, their yards are hung with tattered\r\nwashing unashamed; and there seem to be more boards by the railway every\r\ntime I pass, advertising pills and pickles, tonics and condiments, and\r\nsuchlike solicitudes of a people with no natural health nor appetite\r\nleft in them....\r\n\r\nWell, we have to do better. Failure is not failure nor waste wasted if\r\nit sweeps away illusion and lights the road to a plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nChaotic indiscipline, ill-adjusted effort, spasmodic aims, these give\r\nthe quality of all my Bromstead memories. The crowning one of them all\r\nrises to desolating tragedy. I remember now the wan spring sunshine of\r\nthat Sunday morning, the stiff feeling of best clothes and aggressive\r\ncleanliness and formality, when I and my mother returned from church to\r\nfind my father dead. He had been pruning the grape vine. He had\r\nnever had a ladder long enough to reach the sill of the third-floor\r\nwindows--at house-painting times he had borrowed one from the plumber\r\nwho mixed his paint--and he had in his own happy-go-lucky way contrived\r\na combination of the garden fruit ladder with a battered kitchen table\r\nthat served all sorts of odd purposes in an outhouse. He had stayed up\r\nthis arrangement by means of the garden roller, and the roller had at\r\nthe critical moment--rolled. He was lying close by the garden door with\r\nhis head queerly bent back against a broken and twisted rainwater pipe,\r\nan expression of pacific contentment on his face, a bamboo curtain rod\r\nwith a tableknife tied to end of it, still gripped in his hand. We had\r\nbeen rapping for some time at the front door unable to make him hear,\r\nand then we came round by the door in the side trellis into the garden\r\nand so discovered him.\r\n\r\n“Arthur!” I remember my mother crying with the strangest break in her\r\nvoice, “What are you doing there? Arthur! And--SUNDAY!”\r\n\r\nI was coming behind her, musing remotely, when the quality of her voice\r\nroused me. She stood as if she could not go near him. He had always\r\npuzzled her so, he and his ways, and this seemed only another enigma.\r\nThen the truth dawned on her, she shrieked as if afraid of him, ran a\r\ndozen steps back towards the trellis door and stopped and clasped her\r\nineffectual gloved hands, leaving me staring blankly, too astonished for\r\nfeeling, at the carelessly flung limbs.\r\n\r\nThe same idea came to me also. I ran to her. “Mother!” I cried, pale to\r\nthe depths of my spirit, “IS HE DEAD?”\r\n\r\nI had been thinking two minutes before of the cold fruit pie that\r\nglorified our Sunday dinner-table, and how I might perhaps get into the\r\ntree at the end of the garden to read in the afternoon. Now an immense\r\nfact had come down like a curtain and blotted out all my childish world.\r\nMy father was lying dead before my eyes.... I perceived that my mother\r\nwas helpless and that things must be done.\r\n\r\n“Mother!” I said, “we must get Doctor Beaseley,--and carry him indoors.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE THIRD ~~ SCHOLASTIC\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nMy formal education began in a small preparatory school in Bromstead.\r\nI went there as a day boy. The charge for my instruction was mainly set\r\noff by the periodic visits of my father with a large bag of battered\r\nfossils to lecture to us upon geology. I was one of those fortunate\r\nyoungsters who take readily to school work, I had a good memory,\r\nversatile interests and a considerable appetite for commendation, and\r\nwhen I was barely twelve I got a scholarship at the City Merchants\r\nSchool and was entrusted with a scholar's railway season ticket to\r\nVictoria. After my father's death a large and very animated and solidly\r\nbuilt uncle in tweeds from Staffordshire, Uncle Minter, my mother's\r\nsister's husband, with a remarkable accent and remarkable vowel sounds,\r\nwho had plunged into the Bromstead home once or twice for the night but\r\nwho was otherwise unknown to me, came on the scene, sold off the\r\nthree gaunt houses with the utmost gusto, invested the proceeds and my\r\nfather's life insurance money, and got us into a small villa at Penge\r\nwithin sight of that immense facade of glass and iron, the Crystal\r\nPalace. Then he retired in a mood of good-natured contempt to his native\r\nhabitat again. We stayed at Penge until my mother's death.\r\n\r\nSchool became a large part of the world to me, absorbing my time and\r\ninterest, and I never acquired that detailed and intimate knowledge of\r\nPenge and the hilly villadom round about, that I have of the town and\r\noutskirts of Bromstead.\r\n\r\nIt was a district of very much the same character, but it was more\r\ncompletely urbanised and nearer to the centre of things; there were\r\nthe same unfinished roads, the same occasional disconcerted hedges and\r\ntrees, the same butcher's horse grazing under a builder's notice-board,\r\nthe same incidental lapses into slum. The Crystal Palace grounds cut off\r\na large part of my walking radius to the west with impassable fences\r\nand forbiddingly expensive turnstiles, but it added to the ordinary\r\nspectacle of meteorology a great variety of gratuitous fireworks which\r\nbanged and flared away of a night after supper and drew me abroad to see\r\nthem better. Such walks as I took, to Croydon, Wembledon, West Wickham\r\nand Greenwich, impressed upon me the interminable extent of London's\r\nresidential suburbs; mile after mile one went, between houses, villas,\r\nrows of cottages, streets of shops, under railway arches, over railway\r\nbridges. I have forgotten the detailed local characteristics--if there\r\nwere any--of much of that region altogether. I was only there two years,\r\nand half my perambulations occurred at dusk or after dark. But with\r\nPenge I associate my first realisations of the wonder and beauty of\r\ntwilight and night, the effect of dark walls reflecting lamplight, and\r\nthe mystery of blue haze-veiled hillsides of houses, the glare of shops\r\nby night, the glowing steam and streaming sparks of railway trains and\r\nrailway signals lit up in the darkness. My first rambles in the evening\r\noccurred at Penge--I was becoming a big and independent-spirited\r\nboy--and I began my experience of smoking during these twilight prowls\r\nwith the threepenny packets of American cigarettes then just appearing\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nMy life centred upon the City Merchants School. Usually I caught the\r\neight-eighteen for Victoria, I had a midday meal and tea; four nights a\r\nweek I stayed for preparation, and often I was not back home again until\r\nwithin an hour of my bedtime. I spent my half holidays at school\r\nin order to play cricket and football. This, and a pretty voracious\r\nappetite for miscellaneous reading which was fostered by the Penge\r\nMiddleton Library, did not leave me much leisure for local topography.\r\nOn Sundays also I sang in the choir at St. Martin's Church, and my\r\nmother did not like me to walk out alone on the Sabbath afternoon, she\r\nherself slumbered, so that I wrote or read at home. I must confess I was\r\nat home as little as I could contrive.\r\n\r\nHome, after my father's death, had become a very quiet and uneventful\r\nplace indeed. My mother had either an unimaginative temperament or her\r\nmind was greatly occupied with private religious solicitudes, and I\r\nremember her talking to me but little, and that usually upon topics\r\nI was anxious to evade. I had developed my own view about low-Church\r\ntheology long before my father's death, and my meditation upon that\r\nevent had finished my secret estrangement from my mother's faith. My\r\nreason would not permit even a remote chance of his being in hell, he\r\nwas so manifestly not evil, and this religion would not permit him a\r\nremote chance of being out yet. When I was a little boy my mother had\r\ntaught me to read and write and pray and had done many things for me,\r\nindeed she persisted in washing me and even in making my clothes until I\r\nrebelled against these things as indignities. But our minds parted very\r\nsoon. She never began to understand the mental processes of my play,\r\nshe never interested herself in my school life and work, she could not\r\nunderstand things I said; and she came, I think, quite insensibly to\r\nregard me with something of the same hopeless perplexity she had felt\r\ntowards my father.\r\n\r\nHim she must have wedded under considerable delusions. I do not think\r\nhe deceived her, indeed, nor do I suspect him of mercenariness in\r\ntheir union; but no doubt he played up to her requirements in the half\r\ningenuous way that was and still is the quality of most wooing, and\r\npresented himself as a very brisk and orthodox young man. I wonder why\r\nnearly all love-making has to be fraudulent. Afterwards he must have\r\ndisappointed her cruelly by letting one aspect after another of his\r\ncareless, sceptical, experimental temperament appear. Her mind was fixed\r\nand definite, she embodied all that confidence in church and decorum and\r\nthe assurances of the pulpit which was characteristic of the large mass\r\nof the English people--for after all, the rather low-Church section WAS\r\nthe largest single mass--in early Victorian times. She had dreams, I\r\nsuspect, of going to church with him side by side; she in a little\r\npoke bonnet and a large flounced crinoline, all mauve and magenta and\r\nstarched under a little lace-trimmed parasol, and he in a tall silk hat\r\nand peg-top trousers and a roll-collar coat, and looking rather like\r\nthe Prince Consort,--white angels almost visibly raining benedictions on\r\ntheir amiable progress. Perhaps she dreamt gently of much-belaced babies\r\nand an interestingly pious (but not too dissenting or fanatical) little\r\ngirl or boy or so, also angel-haunted. And I think, too, she must have\r\nseen herself ruling a seemly “home of taste,” with a vivarium in the\r\nconservatory that opened out of the drawing-room, or again, making\r\npreserves in the kitchen. My father's science-teaching, his diagrams\r\nof disembowelled humanity, his pictures of prehistoric beasts that\r\ncontradicted the Flood, his disposition towards soft shirts and loose\r\ntweed suits, his inability to use a clothes brush, his spasmodic reading\r\nfits and his bulldog pipes, must have jarred cruelly with her rather\r\nunintelligent anticipations. His wild moments of violent temper when he\r\nwould swear and smash things, absurd almost lovable storms that passed\r\nlike summer thunder, must have been starkly dreadful to her. She\r\nwas constitutionally inadaptable, and certainly made no attempt to\r\nunderstand or tolerate these outbreaks. She tried them by her standards,\r\nand by her standards they were wrong. Her standards hid him from her.\r\nThe blazing things he said rankled in her mind unforgettably.\r\n\r\nAs I remember them together they chafed constantly. Her attitude\r\nto nearly all his moods and all his enterprises was a sceptical\r\ndisapproval. She treated him as something that belonged to me and not\r\nto her. “YOUR father,” she used to call him, as though I had got him for\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe had married late and she had, I think, become mentally\r\nself-subsisting before her marriage. Even in those Herne Hill days\r\nI used to wonder what was going on in her mind, and I find that old\r\nspeculative curiosity return as I write this. She took a considerable\r\ninterest in the housework that our generally servantless condition put\r\nupon her--she used to have a charwoman in two or three times a week--but\r\nshe did not do it with any great skill. She covered most of our\r\nfurniture with flouncey ill-fitting covers, and she cooked plainly and\r\nwithout very much judgment. The Penge house, as it contained nearly\r\nall our Bromstead things, was crowded with furniture, and is chiefly\r\nassociated in my mind with the smell of turpentine, a condiment she used\r\nvery freely upon the veneered mahogany pieces. My mother had an equal\r\ndread of “blacks” by day and the “night air,” so that our brightly clean\r\nwindows were rarely open.\r\n\r\nShe took a morning paper, and she would open it and glance at the\r\nheadlines, but she did not read it until the afternoon and then, I\r\nthink, she was interested only in the more violent crimes, and in\r\nrailway and mine disasters and in the minutest domesticities of the\r\nRoyal Family. Most of the books at home were my father's, and I do not\r\nthink she opened any of them. She had one or two volumes that dated from\r\nher own youth, and she tried in vain to interest me in them; there was\r\nMiss Strickland's QUEENS OF ENGLAND, a book I remember with particular\r\nanimosity, and QUEECHY and the WIDE WIDE WORLD. She made these books of\r\nhers into a class apart by sewing outer covers upon them of calico and\r\nfigured muslin. To me in these habiliments they seemed not so much books\r\nas confederated old ladies.\r\n\r\nMy mother was also very punctual with her religious duties, and rejoiced\r\nto watch me in the choir.\r\n\r\nOn winter evenings she occupied an armchair on the other side of the\r\ntable at which I sat, head on hand reading, and she would be darning\r\nstockings or socks or the like. We achieved an effect of rather stuffy\r\ncomfortableness that was soporific, and in a passive way I think she\r\nfound these among her happy times. On such occasions she was wont to put\r\nher work down on her knees and fall into a sort of thoughtless musing\r\nthat would last for long intervals and rouse my curiosity. For like most\r\nyoung people I could not imagine mental states without definite forms.\r\n\r\nShe carried on a correspondence with a number of cousins and friends,\r\nwriting letters in a slanting Italian hand and dealing mainly with\r\nbirths, marriages and deaths, business starts (in the vaguest terms) and\r\nthe distresses of bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, you know, she did have a curious intimate life of her own that\r\nI suspected nothing of at the time, that only now becomes credible\r\nto me. She kept a diary that is still in my possession, a diary of\r\nfragmentary entries in a miscellaneous collection of pocket books. She\r\nput down the texts of the sermons she heard, and queer stiff little\r\ncomments on casual visitors,--“Miss G. and much noisy shrieking talk\r\nabout games and such frivolities and CROQUAY. A. delighted and VERY\r\nATTENTIVE.” Such little human entries abound. She had an odd way of\r\nnever writing a name, only an initial; my father is always “A.,” and I\r\nam always “D.” It is manifest she followed the domestic events in the\r\nlife of the Princess of Wales, who is now Queen Mother, with peculiar\r\ninterest and sympathy. “Pray G. all may be well,” she writes in one such\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\nBut there are things about myself that I still find too poignant to tell\r\neasily, certain painful and clumsy circumstances of my birth in very\r\ngreat detail, the distresses of my infantile ailments. Then later I\r\nfind such things as this: “Heard D. s----.” The “s” is evidently “swear\r\n“--“G. bless and keep my boy from evil.” And again, with the thin\r\nhandwriting shaken by distress: “D. would not go to church, and hardened\r\nhis heart and said wicked infidel things, much disrespect of the clergy.\r\nThe anthem is tiresome!!! That men should set up to be wiser than\r\ntheir maker!!!” Then trebly underlined: “I FEAR HIS FATHER'S TEACHING.”\r\n Dreadful little tangle of misapprehensions and false judgments! More\r\ncomforting for me to read, “D. very kind and good. He grows more\r\nthoughtful every day.” I suspect myself of forgotten hypocrisies.\r\n\r\nAt just one point my mother's papers seem to dip deeper. I think the\r\ndeath of my father must have stirred her for the first time for many\r\nyears to think for herself. Even she could not go on living in any peace\r\nat all, believing that he had indeed been flung headlong into hell. Of\r\nthis gnawing solicitude she never spoke to me, never, and for her diary\r\nalso she could find no phrases. But on a loose half-sheet of notepaper\r\nbetween its pages I find this passage that follows, written very\r\ncarefully. I do not know whose lines they are nor how she came upon\r\nthem. They run:--\r\n\r\n     “And if there be no meeting past the grave;\r\n      If all is darkness, silence, yet 'tis rest.\r\n      Be not afraid ye waiting hearts that weep,\r\n      For God still giveth His beloved sleep,\r\n      And if an endless sleep He wills, so best.”\r\n\r\nThat scrap of verse amazed me when I read it. I could even wonder if my\r\nmother really grasped the import of what she had copied out. It affected\r\nme as if a stone-deaf person had suddenly turned and joined in a\r\nwhispered conversation. It set me thinking how far a mind in its general\r\neffect quite hopelessly limited, might range. After that I went through\r\nall her diaries, trying to find something more than a conventional term\r\nof tenderness for my father. But I found nothing. And yet somehow there\r\ngrew upon me the realisation that there had been love.... Her love for\r\nme, on the other hand, was abundantly expressed.\r\n\r\nI knew nothing of that secret life of feeling at the time; such\r\nexpression as it found was all beyond my schoolboy range. I did not know\r\nwhen I pleased her and I did not know when I distressed her. Chiefly\r\nI was aware of my mother as rather dull company, as a mind thorny with\r\nirrational conclusions and incapable of explication, as one believing\r\nquite wilfully and irritatingly in impossible things. So I suppose it\r\nhad to be; life was coming to me in new forms and with new requirements.\r\nIt was essential to our situation that we should fail to understand.\r\nAfter this space of years I have come to realisations and attitudes that\r\ndissolve my estrangement from her, I can pierce these barriers, I\r\ncan see her and feel her as a loving and feeling and desiring and\r\nmuddle-headed person. There are times when I would have her alive again,\r\nif only that I might be kind to her for a little while and give her\r\nsome return for the narrow intense affection, the tender desires, she\r\nevidently lavished so abundantly on me. But then again I ask how I\r\ncould make that return? And I realise the futility of such dreaming. Her\r\ndemand was rigid, and to meet it I should need to act and lie.\r\n\r\nSo she whose blood fed me, whose body made me, lies in my memory as I\r\nsaw her last, fixed, still, infinitely intimate, infinitely remote....\r\n\r\nMy own case with my mother, however, does not awaken the same regret I\r\nfeel when I think of how she misjudged and irked my father, and turned\r\nhis weaknesses into thorns for her own tormenting. I wish I could look\r\nback without that little twinge to two people who were both in their\r\ndifferent quality so good. But goodness that is narrow is a pedestrian\r\nand ineffectual goodness. Her attitude to my father seems to me one of\r\nthe essentially tragic things that have come to me personally, one of\r\nthose things that nothing can transfigure, that REMAIN sorrowful, that I\r\ncannot soothe with any explanation, for as I remember him he was indeed\r\nthe most lovable of weak spasmodic men. But my mother had been trained\r\nin a hard and narrow system that made evil out of many things not in\r\nthe least evil, and inculcated neither kindliness nor charity. All their\r\nestrangement followed from that.\r\n\r\nThese cramping cults do indeed take an enormous toll of human love\r\nand happiness, and not only that but what we Machiavellians must needs\r\nconsider, they make frightful breaches in human solidarity. I suppose I\r\nam a deeply religious man, as men of my quality go, but I hate more\r\nand more, as I grow older, the shadow of intolerance cast by religious\r\norganisations. All my life has been darkened by irrational intolerance,\r\nby arbitrary irrational prohibitions and exclusions. Mahometanism\r\nwith its fierce proselytism, has, I suppose, the blackest record of\r\nuncharitableness, but most of the Christian sects are tainted, tainted\r\nto a degree beyond any of the anterior paganisms, with this same hateful\r\nquality. It is their exclusive claim that sends them wrong, the vain\r\nambition that inspires them all to teach a uniform one-sided God and be\r\nthe one and only gateway to salvation. Deprecation of all outside the\r\nhousehold of faith, an organised undervaluation of heretical goodness\r\nand lovableness, follows, necessarily. Every petty difference is\r\nexaggerated to the quality of a saving grace or a damning defect.\r\nElaborate precautions are taken to shield the believer's mind against\r\nbroad or amiable suggestions; the faithful are deterred by dark\r\nallusions, by sinister warnings, from books, from theatres, from\r\nworldly conversation, from all the kindly instruments that mingle human\r\nsympathy. For only by isolating its flock can the organisation survive.\r\n\r\nEvery month there came to my mother a little magazine called, if I\r\nremember rightly, the HOME CHURCHMAN, with the combined authority of\r\nprint and clerical commendation. It was the most evil thing that ever\r\ncame into the house, a very devil, a thin little pamphlet with\r\none woodcut illustration on the front page of each number; now the\r\nuninviting visage of some exponent of the real and only doctrine and\r\nattitudes, now some coral strand in act of welcoming the missionaries of\r\nGod's mysterious preferences, now a new church in the Victorian Gothic.\r\nThe vile rag it was! A score of vices that shun the policeman have\r\nnothing of its subtle wickedness. It was an outrage upon the natural\r\nkindliness of men. The contents were all admirably adjusted to keep a\r\nspirit in prison. Their force of sustained suggestion was tremendous.\r\nThere would be dreadful intimations of the swift retribution that fell\r\nupon individuals for Sabbath-breaking, and upon nations for weakening\r\ntowards Ritualism, or treating Roman Catholics as tolerable human\r\nbeings; there would be great rejoicings over the conversion of alleged\r\nJews, and terrible descriptions of the death-beds of prominent infidels\r\nwith boldly invented last words,--the most unscrupulous lying; there\r\nwould be the appallingly edifying careers of “early piety” lusciously\r\ndescribed, or stories of condemned criminals who traced their final ruin\r\nunerringly to early laxities of the kind that leads people to give up\r\nsubscribing to the HOME CHURCHMAN.\r\n\r\nEvery month that evil spirit brought about a slump in our mutual love.\r\nMy mother used to read the thing and become depressed and anxious for my\r\nspiritual welfare, used to be stirred to unintelligent pestering....\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nA few years ago I met the editor of this same HOME CHURCHMAN. It was\r\nat one of the weekly dinners of that Fleet Street dining club, the\r\nBlackfriars.\r\n\r\nI heard the paper's name with a queer little shock and surveyed the\r\nman with interest. No doubt he was only a successor of the purveyor of\r\ndiscords who darkened my boyhood. It was amazing to find an influence\r\nso terrible embodied in a creature so palpably petty. He was seated some\r\nway down a table at right angles to the one at which I sat, a man of\r\nmean appearance with a greyish complexion, thin, with a square nose,\r\na heavy wiry moustache and a big Adam's apple sticking out between the\r\nwings of his collar. He ate with considerable appetite and unconcealed\r\nrelish, and as his jaw was underhung, he chummed and made the moustache\r\nwave like reeds in the swell of a steamer. It gave him a conscientious\r\nlook. After dinner he a little forced himself upon me. At that time,\r\nthough the shadow of my scandal was already upon me, I still seemed to\r\nbe shaping for great successes, and he was glad to be in conversation\r\nwith me and anxious to intimate political sympathy and support. I tried\r\nto make him talk of the HOME CHURCHMAN and the kindred publications he\r\nran, but he was manifestly ashamed of his job so far as I was concerned.\r\n\r\n“One wants,” he said, pitching himself as he supposed in my key, “to put\r\nconstructive ideas into our readers, but they are narrow, you know, very\r\nnarrow. Very.” He made his moustache and lips express judicious regret.\r\n“One has to consider them carefully, one has to respect their attitudes.\r\nOne dare not go too far with them. One has to feel one's way.”\r\n\r\nHe chummed and the moustache bristled.\r\n\r\nA hireling, beyond question, catering for a demand. I gathered there\r\nwas a home in Tufnell Park, and three boys to be fed and clothed and\r\neducated....\r\n\r\nI had the curiosity to buy a copy of his magazine afterwards, and it\r\nseemed much the same sort of thing that had worried my mother in my\r\nboyhood. There was the usual Christian hero, this time with mutton-chop\r\nwhiskers and a long bare upper lip. The Jesuits, it seemed, were still\r\nhard at it, and Heaven frightfully upset about the Sunday opening of\r\nmuseums and the falling birth-rate, and as touchy and vindictive as\r\never. There were two vigorous paragraphs upon the utter damnableness\r\nof the Rev. R. J. Campbell, a contagious damnableness I gathered, one\r\nwasn't safe within a mile of Holborn Viaduct, and a foul-mouthed\r\nattack on poor little Wilkins the novelist--who was being baited by the\r\nmoralists at that time for making one of his big women characters, not\r\nbeing in holy wedlock, desire a baby and say so....\r\n\r\nThe broadening of human thought is a slow and complex process. We do go\r\non, we do get on. But when one thinks that people are living and dying\r\nnow, quarrelling and sulking, misled and misunderstanding, vaguely\r\nfearful, condemning and thwarting one another in the close darknesses of\r\nthese narrow cults--Oh, God! one wants a gale out of Heaven, one wants a\r\ngreat wind from the sea!\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nWhile I lived at Penge two little things happened to me, trivial in\r\nthemselves and yet in their quality profoundly significant. They had\r\nthis in common, that they pierced the texture of the life I was quietly\r\ntaking for granted and let me see through it into realities--realities\r\nI had indeed known about before but never realised. Each of these\r\nexperiences left me with a sense of shock, with all the values in\r\nmy life perplexingly altered, attempting readjustment. One of these\r\ndisturbing and illuminating events was that I was robbed of a new\r\npocket-knife and the other that I fell in love. It was altogether\r\nsurprising to me to be robbed. You see, as an only child I had always\r\nbeen fairly well looked after and protected, and the result was an\r\namazing confidence in the practical goodness of the people one met in\r\nthe world. I knew there were robbers in the world, just as I knew there\r\nwere tigers; that I was ever likely to meet robber or tiger face to face\r\nseemed equally impossible.\r\n\r\nThe knife as I remember it was a particularly jolly one with all sorts\r\nof instruments in it, tweezers and a thing for getting a stone out\r\nof the hoof of a horse, and a corkscrew; it had cost me a carefully\r\naccumulated half-crown, and amounted indeed to a new experience in\r\nknives. I had had it for two or three days, and then one afternoon I\r\ndropped it through a hole in my pocket on a footpath crossing a field\r\nbetween Penge and Anerley. I heard it fall in the way one does without\r\nat the time appreciating what had happened, then, later, before I got\r\nhome, when my hand wandered into my pocket to embrace the still dear\r\nnew possession I found it gone, and instantly that memory of something\r\nhitting the ground sprang up into consciousness. I went back and\r\ncommenced a search. Almost immediately I was accosted by the leader of a\r\nlittle gang of four or five extremely dirty and ragged boys of assorted\r\nsizes and slouching carriage who were coming from the Anerley direction.\r\n\r\n“Lost anythink, Matey?” said he.\r\n\r\nI explained.\r\n\r\n“'E's dropped 'is knife,” said my interlocutor, and joined in the\r\nsearch.\r\n\r\n“What sort of 'andle was it, Matey?” said a small white-faced sniffing\r\nboy in a big bowler hat.\r\n\r\nI supplied the information. His sharp little face scrutinised the ground\r\nabout us.\r\n\r\n“GOT it,” he said, and pounced.\r\n\r\n“Give it 'ere,” said the big boy hoarsely, and secured it.\r\n\r\nI walked towards him serenely confident that he would hand it over to\r\nme, and that all was for the best in the best of all possible worlds.\r\n\r\n“No bloomin' fear!” he said, regarding me obliquely. “Oo said it was\r\nyour knife?”\r\n\r\nRemarkable doubts assailed me. “Of course it's my knife,” I said. The\r\nother boys gathered round me.\r\n\r\n“This ain't your knife,” said the big boy, and spat casually.\r\n\r\n“I dropped it just now.”\r\n\r\n“Findin's keepin's, I believe,” said the big boy.\r\n\r\n“Nonsense,” I said. “Give me my knife.”\r\n\r\n“'Ow many blades it got?”\r\n\r\n“Three.”\r\n\r\n“And what sort of 'andle?”\r\n\r\n“Bone.”\r\n\r\n“Got a corkscrew like?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! This ain't your knife no'ow. See?”\r\n\r\nHe made no offer to show it to me. My breath went.\r\n\r\n“Look here!” I said. “I saw that kid pick it up. It IS my knife.”\r\n\r\n“Rot!” said the big boy, and slowly, deliberately put my knife into his\r\ntrouser pocket.\r\n\r\nI braced my soul for battle. All civilisation was behind me, but I doubt\r\nif it kept the colour in my face. I buttoned my jacket and clenched my\r\nfists and advanced on my antagonist--he had, I suppose, the advantage of\r\ntwo years of age and three inches of height. “Hand over that knife,” I\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThen one of the smallest of the band assailed me with extraordinary\r\nvigour and swiftness from behind, had an arm round my neck and a knee in\r\nmy back before I had the slightest intimation of attack, and so got me\r\ndown. “I got 'im, Bill,” squeaked this amazing little ruffian. My nose\r\nwas flattened by a dirty hand, and as I struck out and hit something\r\nlike sacking, some one kicked my elbow. Two or three seemed to be at\r\nme at the same time. Then I rolled over and sat up to discover them all\r\nmaking off, a ragged flight, footballing my cap, my City Merchants' cap,\r\namongst them. I leapt to my feet in a passion of indignation and pursued\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBut I did not overtake them. We are beings of mixed composition, and I\r\ndoubt if mine was a single-minded pursuit. I knew that honour required\r\nme to pursue, and I had a vivid impression of having just been down\r\nin the dust with a very wiry and active and dirty little antagonist of\r\ndisagreeable odour and incredible and incalculable unscrupulousness,\r\nkneeling on me and gripping my arm and neck. I wanted of course to be\r\neven with him, but also I doubted if catching him would necessarily\r\ninvolve that. They kicked my cap into the ditch at the end of the field,\r\nand made off compactly along a cinder lane while I turned aside to\r\nrecover my dishonoured headdress. As I knocked the dust out of that and\r\nout of my jacket, and brushed my knees and readjusted my very crumpled\r\ncollar, I tried to focus this startling occurrence in my mind.\r\n\r\nI had vague ideas of going to a policeman or of complaining at a police\r\nstation, but some boyish instinct against informing prevented that. No\r\ndoubt I entertained ideas of vindictive pursuit and murderous reprisals.\r\nAnd I was acutely enraged whenever I thought of my knife. The thing\r\nindeed rankled in my mind for weeks and weeks, and altered all the\r\nflavour of my world for me. It was the first time I glimpsed the simple\r\nbrute violence that lurks and peeps beneath our civilisation. A certain\r\nkindly complacency of attitude towards the palpably lower classes was\r\nqualified for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nBut the other experience was still more cardinal. It was the first clear\r\nintimation of a new motif in life, the sex motif, that was to rise and\r\nincrease and accumulate power and enrichment and interweave with and at\r\nlast dominate all my life.\r\n\r\nIt was when I was nearly fifteen this happened. It is inseparably\r\nconnected in my mind with the dusk of warm September evenings. I never\r\nmet the girl I loved by daylight, and I have forgotten her name. It was\r\nsome insignificant name.\r\n\r\nYet the peculiar quality of the adventure keeps it shining darkly like\r\nsome deep coloured gem in the common setting of my memories. It came as\r\nsomething new and strange, something that did not join on to anything\r\nelse in my life or connect with any of my thoughts or beliefs or habits;\r\nit was a wonder, a mystery, a discovery about myself, a discovery\r\nabout the whole world. Only in after years did sexual feeling lose that\r\nisolation and spread itself out to illuminate and pervade and at last\r\npossess the whole broad vision of life.\r\n\r\nIt was in that phase of an urban youth's development, the phase of the\r\ncheap cigarette, that this thing happened. One evening I came by chance\r\non a number of young people promenading by the light of a row of shops\r\ntowards Beckington, and, with all the glory of a glowing cigarette\r\nbetween my lips, I joined their strolling number. These twilight parades\r\nof young people, youngsters chiefly of the lower middle-class, are one\r\nof the odd social developments of the great suburban growths--unkindly\r\ncritics, blind to the inner meanings of things, call them, I believe,\r\nMonkeys' Parades--the shop apprentices, the young work girls, the boy\r\nclerks and so forth, stirred by mysterious intimations, spend their\r\nfirst-earned money upon collars and ties, chiffon hats, smart lace\r\ncollars, walking-sticks, sunshades or cigarettes, and come valiantly\r\ninto the vague transfiguring mingling of gaslight and evening, to walk\r\nup and down, to eye meaningly, even to accost and make friends. It is\r\na queer instinctive revolt from the narrow limited friendless homes in\r\nwhich so many find themselves, a going out towards something, romance if\r\nyou will, beauty, that has suddenly become a need--a need that hitherto\r\nhas lain dormant and unsuspected. They promenade.\r\n\r\nVulgar!--it is as vulgar as the spirit that calls the moth abroad in the\r\nevening and lights the body of the glow-worm in the night. I made my\r\nway through the throng, a little contemptuously as became a public\r\nschoolboy, my hands in my pockets--none of your cheap canes for me!--and\r\nvery careful of the lie of my cigarette upon my lips. And two girls\r\npassed me, one a little taller than the other, with dim warm-tinted\r\nfaces under clouds of dark hair and with dark eyes like pools reflecting\r\nstars.\r\n\r\nI half turned, and the shorter one glanced back at me over her\r\nshoulder--I could draw you now the pose of her cheek and neck and\r\nshoulder--and instantly I was as passionately in love with the girl as\r\nI have ever been before or since, as any man ever was with any woman. I\r\nturned about and followed them, I flung away my cigarette ostentatiously\r\nand lifted my school cap and spoke to them.\r\n\r\nThe girl answered shyly with her dark eyes on my face. What I said\r\nand what she said I cannot remember, but I have little doubt it was\r\nsomething absolutely vapid. It really did not matter; the thing was we\r\nhad met. I felt as I think a new-hatched moth must feel when suddenly\r\nits urgent headlong searching brings it in tremulous amazement upon its\r\nmate.\r\n\r\nWe met, covered from each other, with all the nets of civilisation\r\nkeeping us apart. We walked side by side.\r\n\r\nIt led to scarcely more than that. I think we met four or five times\r\naltogether, and always with her nearly silent elder sister on the other\r\nside of her. We walked on the last two occasions arm in arm, furtively\r\ncaressing each other's hands, we went away from the glare of the shops\r\ninto the quiet roads of villadom, and there we whispered instead of\r\ntalking and looked closely into one another's warm and shaded face.\r\n“Dear,” I whispered very daringly, and she answered, “Dear!” We had a\r\nvague sense that we wanted more of that quality of intimacy and more. We\r\nwanted each other as one wants beautiful music again or to breathe again\r\nthe scent of flowers.\r\n\r\nAnd that is all there was between us. The events are nothing, the thing\r\nthat matters is the way in which this experience stabbed through the\r\ncommon stuff of life and left it pierced, with a light, with a huge new\r\ninterest shining through the rent.\r\n\r\nWhen I think of it I can recall even now the warm mystery of her face,\r\nher lips a little apart, lips that I never kissed, her soft shadowed\r\nthroat, and I feel again the sensuous stir of her proximity....\r\n\r\nThose two girls never told me their surname nor let me approach their\r\nhouse. They made me leave them at the corner of a road of small houses\r\nnear Penge Station. And quite abruptly, without any intimation, they\r\nvanished and came to the meeting place no more, they vanished as a\r\nmoth goes out of a window into the night, and left me possessed of an\r\nintolerable want....\r\n\r\nThe affair pervaded my existence for many weeks. I could not do my work\r\nand I could not rest at home. Night after night I promenaded up and down\r\nthat Monkeys' Parade full of an unappeasable desire, with a thwarted\r\nsense of something just begun that ought to have gone on. I went\r\nbackwards and forwards on the way to the vanishing place, and at last\r\nexplored the forbidden road that had swallowed them up. But I never saw\r\nher again, except that later she came to me, my symbol of womanhood, in\r\ndreams. How my blood was stirred! I lay awake of nights whispering in\r\nthe darkness for her. I prayed for her.\r\n\r\nIndeed that girl, who probably forgot the last vestiges of me when her\r\nfirst real kiss came to her, ruled and haunted me, gave a Queen to my\r\nimagination and a texture to all my desires until I became a man.\r\n\r\nI generalised her at last. I suddenly discovered that poetry was about\r\nher and that she was the key to all that had hitherto seemed nonsense\r\nabout love. I took to reading novels, and if the heroine could not\r\npossibly be like her, dusky and warm and starlike, I put the book\r\naside....\r\n\r\nI hesitate and add here one other confession. I want to tell this thing\r\nbecause it seems to me we are altogether too restrained and secretive\r\nabout such matters. The cardinal thing in life sneaks in to us darkly\r\nand shamefully like a thief in the night.\r\n\r\nOne day during my Cambridge days--it must have been in my first year\r\nbefore I knew Hatherleigh--I saw in a print-shop window near the Strand\r\nan engraving of a girl that reminded me sharply of Penge and its dusky\r\nencounter. It was just a half length of a bare-shouldered, bare-breasted\r\nOriental with arms akimbo, smiling faintly. I looked at it, went my way,\r\nthen turned back and bought it. I felt I must have it. The odd thing\r\nis that I was more than a little shamefaced about it. I did not have it\r\nframed and hung in my room open to the criticism of my friends, but I\r\nkept it in the drawer of my writing-table. And I kept that drawer locked\r\nfor a year. It speedily merged with and became identified with the dark\r\ngirl of Penge. That engraving became in a way my mistress. Often when I\r\nhad sported my oak and was supposed to be reading, I was sitting with it\r\nbefore me.\r\n\r\nObeying some instinct I kept the thing very secret indeed. For a time\r\nnobody suspected what was locked in my drawer nor what was locked in me.\r\nI seemed as sexless as my world required.\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nThese things stabbed through my life, intimations of things above and\r\nbelow and before me. They had an air of being no more than incidents,\r\ninterruptions.\r\n\r\nThe broad substance of my existence at this time was the City Merchants\r\nSchool. Home was a place where I slept and read, and the mooning\r\nexplorations of the south-eastern postal district which occupied the\r\nrestless evenings and spare days of my vacations mere interstices,\r\ngiving glimpses of enigmatical lights and distant spaces between the\r\nwoven threads of a school-boy's career. School life began for me every\r\nmorning at Herne Hill, for there I was joined by three or four other\r\nboys and the rest of the way we went together. Most of the streets and\r\nroads we traversed in our morning's walk from Victoria are still intact,\r\nthe storms of rebuilding that have submerged so much of my boyhood's\r\nLondon have passed and left them, and I have revived the impression of\r\nthem again and again in recent years as I have clattered dinnerward in a\r\nhansom or hummed along in a motor cab to some engagement. The main gate\r\nstill looks out with the same expression of ancient well-proportioned\r\nkindliness upon St. Margaret's Close. There are imposing new science\r\nlaboratories in Chambers Street indeed, but the old playing fields are\r\nunaltered except for the big electric trams that go droning and spitting\r\nblue flashes along the western boundary. I know Ratten, the new Head,\r\nvery well, but I have not been inside the school to see if it has\r\nchanged at all since I went up to Cambridge.\r\n\r\nI took all they put before us very readily as a boy, for I had a mind of\r\nvigorous appetite, but since I have grown mentally to man's estate and\r\ndeveloped a more and more comprehensive view of our national process\r\nand our national needs, I am more and more struck by the oddity of the\r\neducational methods pursued, their aimless disconnectedness from the\r\nconstructive forces in the community. I suppose if we are to view the\r\npublic school as anything more than an institution that has just chanced\r\nto happen, we must treat it as having a definite function towards the\r\ngeneral scheme of the nation, as being in a sense designed to take the\r\ncrude young male of the more or less responsible class, to correct\r\nhis harsh egotisms, broaden his outlook, give him a grasp of the\r\ncontemporary developments he will presently be called upon to influence\r\nand control, and send him on to the university to be made a leading and\r\nruling social man. It is easy enough to carp at schoolmasters and set up\r\nfor an Educational Reformer, I know, but still it is impossible not\r\nto feel how infinitely more effectually--given certain impossibilities\r\nperhaps--the job might be done.\r\n\r\nMy memory of school has indeed no hint whatever of that quality of\r\nelucidation it seems reasonable to demand from it. Here all about me\r\nwas London, a vast inexplicable being, a vortex of gigantic forces, that\r\nfilled and overwhelmed me with impressions, that stirred my imagination\r\nto a perpetual vague enquiry; and my school not only offered no key\r\nto it, but had practically no comment to make upon it at all. We were\r\nwithin three miles of Westminster and Charing Cross, the government\r\noffices of a fifth of mankind were all within an hour's stroll, great\r\neconomic changes were going on under our eyes, now the hoardings flamed\r\nwith election placards, now the Salvation Army and now the unemployed\r\ncame trailing in procession through the winter-grey streets, now the\r\nnewspaper placards outside news-shops told of battles in strange places,\r\nnow of amazing discoveries, now of sinister crimes, abject squalor and\r\npoverty, imperial splendour and luxury, Buckingham Palace, Rotten Row,\r\nMayfair, the slums of Pimlico, garbage-littered streets of bawling\r\ncostermongers, the inky silver of the barge-laden Thames--such was the\r\nbackground of our days. We went across St. Margaret's Close and through\r\nthe school gate into a quiet puerile world apart from all these things.\r\nWe joined in the earnest acquirement of all that was necessary for Greek\r\nepigrams and Latin verse, and for the rest played games. We dipped down\r\ninto something clear and elegantly proportioned and time-worn and for\r\nall its high resolve of stalwart virility a little feeble, like our\r\nblackened and decayed portals by Inigo Jones.\r\n\r\nWithin, we were taught as the chief subjects of instruction, Latin and\r\nGreek. We were taught very badly because the men who taught us did not\r\nhabitually use either of these languages, nobody uses them any more\r\nnow except perhaps for the Latin of a few Levantine monasteries. At the\r\nutmost our men read them. We were taught these languages because long\r\nago Latin had been the language of civilisation; the one way of escape\r\nfrom the narrow and localised life had lain in those days through Latin,\r\nand afterwards Greek had come in as the vehicle of a flood of new and\r\namazing ideas. Once these two languages had been the sole means of\r\ninitiation to the detached criticism and partial comprehension of the\r\nworld. I can imagine the fierce zeal of our first Heads, Gardener and\r\nRoper, teaching Greek like passionate missionaries, as a progressive\r\nChinaman might teach English to the boys of Pekin, clumsily,\r\nimpatiently, with rod and harsh urgency, but sincerely, patriotically,\r\nbecause they felt that behind it lay revelations, the irresistible\r\nstimulus to a new phase of history. That was long ago. A new great\r\nworld, a vaster Imperialism had arisen about the school, had assimilated\r\nall these amazing and incredible ideas, had gone on to new and yet more\r\namazing developments of its own. But the City Merchants School still\r\nmade the substance of its teaching Latin and Greek, still, with no\r\nthought of rotating crops, sowed in a dream amidst the harvesting.\r\n\r\nThere is no fierceness left in the teaching now. Just after I went up\r\nto Trinity, Gates, our Head, wrote a review article in defence of our\r\ncurriculum. In this, among other indiscretions, he asserted that it was\r\nimpossible to write good English without an illuminating knowledge of\r\nthe classic tongues, and he split an infinitive and failed to button up\r\na sentence in saying so. His main argument conceded every objection\r\na reasonable person could make to the City Merchants' curriculum. He\r\nadmitted that translation had now placed all the wisdom of the past at\r\na common man's disposal, that scarcely a field of endeavour remained\r\nin which modern work had not long since passed beyond the ancient\r\nachievement. He disclaimed any utility. But there was, he said, a\r\npeculiar magic in these grammatical exercises no other subjects of\r\ninstruction possessed. Nothing else provided the same strengthening and\r\norderly discipline for the mind.\r\n\r\nHe said that, knowing the Senior Classics he did, himself a Senior\r\nClassic!\r\n\r\nYet in a dim confused way I think he was making out a case. In schools\r\nas we knew them, and with the sort of assistant available, the sort of\r\nassistant who has been trained entirely on the old lines, he could\r\nsee no other teaching so effectual in developing attention, restraint,\r\nsustained constructive effort and various yet systematic adjustment. And\r\nthat was as far as his imagination could go.\r\n\r\nIt is infinitely easier to begin organised human affairs than end them;\r\nthe curriculum and the social organisation of the English public school\r\nare the crowning instances of that. They go on because they have begun.\r\nSchools are not only immortal institutions but reproductive ones. Our\r\nfounder, Jabez Arvon, knew nothing, I am sure, of Gates' pedagogic\r\nvalues and would, I feel certain, have dealt with them disrespectfully.\r\nBut public schools and university colleges sprang into existence\r\ncorrelated, the scholars went on to the universities and came back to\r\nteach the schools, to teach as they themselves had been taught, before\r\nthey had ever made any real use of the teaching; the crowd of boys\r\nherded together, a crowd perpetually renewed and unbrokenly the same,\r\nadjusted itself by means of spontaneously developed institutions. In\r\na century, by its very success, this revolutionary innovation of\r\nRenascence public schools had become an immense tradition woven closely\r\ninto the fabric of the national life. Intelligent and powerful people\r\nceased to talk Latin or read Greek, they had got what was wanted, but\r\nthat only left the schoolmaster the freer to elaborate his point. Since\r\nmost men of any importance or influence in the country had been through\r\nthe mill, it was naturally a little difficult to persuade them that\r\nit was not quite the best and most ennobling mill the wit of man could\r\ndevise. And, moreover, they did not want their children made strange to\r\nthem. There was all the machinery and all the men needed to teach the\r\nold subjects, and none to teach whatever new the critic might propose.\r\nSuch science instruction as my father gave seemed indeed the uninviting\r\nalternative to the classical grind. It was certainly an altogether\r\ninferior instrument at that time.\r\n\r\nSo it was I occupied my mind with the exact study of dead languages\r\nfor seven long years. It was the strangest of detachments. We would sit\r\nunder the desk of such a master as Topham like creatures who had fallen\r\ninto an enchanted pit, and he would do his considerable best to work us\r\nup to enthusiasm for, let us say, a Greek play. If we flagged he would\r\nlash himself to revive us. He would walk about the class-room mouthing\r\ngreat lines in a rich roar, and asking us with a flushed face and\r\nshining eyes if it was not “GLORIOUS.” The very sight of Greek letters\r\nbrings back to me the dingy, faded, ink-splashed quality of our\r\nclass-room, the banging of books, Topham's disordered hair, the sheen of\r\nhis alpaca gown, his deep unmusical intonations and the wide striding\r\nof his creaking boots. Glorious! And being plastic human beings we would\r\nconsent that it was glorious, and some of us even achieved an answering\r\nreverberation and a sympathetic flush. I at times responded freely. We\r\nall accepted from him unquestioningly that these melodies, these strange\r\nsounds, exceeded any possibility of beauty that lay in the Gothic\r\nintricacy, the splash and glitter, the jar and recovery, the stabbing\r\nlights, the heights and broad distances of our English tongue. That\r\nindeed was the chief sin of him. It was not that he was for Greek and\r\nLatin, but that he was fiercely against every beauty that was neither\r\nclassic nor deferred to classical canons.\r\n\r\nAnd what exactly did we make of it, we seniors who understood it best?\r\nWe visualised dimly through that dust and the grammatical difficulties,\r\nthe spectacle of the chorus chanting grotesquely, helping out\r\nprotagonist and antagonist, masked and buskined, with the telling of\r\nincomprehensible parricides, of inexplicable incest, of gods faded\r\nbeyond symbolism, of that Relentless Law we did not believe in for a\r\nmoment, that no modern western European can believe in. We thought\r\nof the characters in the unconvincing wigs and costumes of our school\r\nperformance. No Gilbert Murray had come as yet to touch these things\r\nto life again. It was like the ghost of an antiquarian's toy theatre,\r\na ghost that crumbled and condensed into a gritty dust of construing as\r\none looked at it.\r\n\r\nMarks, shindies, prayers and punishments, all flavoured with the\r\nleathery stuffiness of time-worn Big Hall....\r\n\r\nAnd then out one would come through our grey old gate into the evening\r\nlight and the spectacle of London hurrying like a cataract, London in\r\nblack and brown and blue and gleaming silver, roaring like the very loom\r\nof Time. We came out into the new world no teacher has yet had the power\r\nand courage to grasp and expound. Life and death sang all about one,\r\njoys and fears on such a scale, in such an intricacy as never Greek\r\nnor Roman knew. The interminable procession of horse omnibuses went\r\nlumbering past, bearing countless people we knew not whence, we knew\r\nnot whither. Hansoms clattered, foot passengers jostled one, a thousand\r\nappeals of shop and boarding caught the eye. The multi-coloured lights\r\nof window and street mingled with the warm glow of the declining day\r\nunder the softly flushing London skies; the ever-changing placards,\r\nthe shouting news-vendors, told of a kaleidoscopic drama all about the\r\nglobe. One did not realise what had happened to us, but the voice\r\nof Topham was suddenly drowned and lost, he and his minute, remote\r\ngesticulations....\r\n\r\nThat submerged and isolated curriculum did not even join on to living\r\ninterests where it might have done so. We were left absolutely to the\r\nhints of the newspapers, to casual political speeches, to the cartoons\r\nof the comic papers or a chance reading of some Socialist pamphlet for\r\nany general ideas whatever about the huge swirling world process\r\nin which we found ourselves. I always look back with particular\r\nexasperation to the cessation of our modern history at the year 1815.\r\nThere it pulled up abruptly, as though it had come upon something\r\nindelicate....\r\n\r\nBut, after all, what would Topham or Flack have made of the huge\r\nadjustments of the nineteenth century? Flack was the chief cricketer on\r\nthe staff; he belonged to that great cult which pretends that the place\r\nof this or that county in the struggle for the championship is a matter\r\nof supreme importance to boys. He obliged us to affect a passionate\r\ninterest in the progress of county matches, to work up unnatural\r\nenthusiasms. What a fuss there would be when some well-trained boy,\r\npanting as if from Marathon, appeared with an evening paper! “I say, you\r\nchaps, Middlesex all out for a hundred and five!”\r\n\r\nUnder Flack's pressure I became, I confess, a cricket humbug of the\r\nfirst class. I applied myself industriously year by year to mastering\r\nscores and averages; I pretended that Lords or the Oval were the places\r\nnearest Paradise for me. (I never went to either.) Through a slight\r\nmistake about the county boundary I adopted Surrey for my loyalty,\r\nthough as a matter of fact we were by some five hundred yards or so in\r\nKent. It did quite as well for my purposes. I bowled rather straight and\r\nfast, and spent endless hours acquiring the skill to bowl Flack out. He\r\nwas a bat in the Corinthian style, rich and voluminous, and succumbed\r\nvery easily to a low shooter or an unexpected Yorker, but usually he was\r\ncaught early by long leg. The difficulty was to bowl him before he got\r\ncaught. He loved to lift a ball to leg. After one had clean bowled him\r\nat the practice nets one deliberately gave him a ball to leg just to\r\nmake him feel nice again.\r\n\r\nFlack went about a world of marvels dreaming of leg hits. He has been\r\nobserved, going across the Park on his way to his highly respectable\r\nclub in Piccadilly, to break from profound musings into a strange brief\r\ndance that ended with an imaginary swipe with his umbrella, a roofer,\r\nover the trees towards Buckingham Palace. The hit accomplished, Flack\r\nresumed his way.\r\n\r\nInadequately instructed foreigners would pass him in terror, needlessly\r\nalert.\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nThese schoolmasters move through my memory as always a little distant\r\nand more than a little incomprehensible. Except when they wore flannels,\r\nI saw them almost always in old college caps and gowns, a uniform which\r\ngreatly increased their detachment from the world of actual men. Gates,\r\nthe head, was a lean loose-limbed man, rather stupid I discovered when I\r\nreached the Sixth and came into contact with him, but honest, simple\r\nand very eager to be liberal-minded. He was bald, with an almost conical\r\nbaldness, with a grizzled pointed beard, small featured and, under the\r\nstresses of a Zeitgeist that demanded liberality, with an expression of\r\npuzzled but resolute resistance to his own unalterable opinions. He made\r\na tall dignified figure in his gown. In my junior days he spoke to me\r\nonly three or four times, and then he annoyed me by giving me a wrong\r\nsurname; it was a sore point because I was an outsider and not one of\r\nthe old school families, the Shoesmiths, the Naylors, the Marklows, the\r\nTophams, the Pevises and suchlike, who came generation after generation.\r\nI recall him most vividly against the background of faded brown\r\nbook-backs in the old library in which we less destructive seniors were\r\ntrusted to work, with the light from the stained-glass window falling\r\nin coloured patches on his face. It gave him the appearance of having no\r\ncolour of his own. He had a habit of scratching the beard on his cheek\r\nas he talked, and he used to come and consult us about things and\r\ninvariably do as we said. That, in his phraseology, was “maintaining the\r\ntraditions of the school.”\r\n\r\nHe had indeed an effect not of a man directing a school, but of a\r\nman captured and directed by a school. Dead and gone Elizabethans had\r\nbegotten a monster that could carry him about in its mouth.\r\n\r\nYet being a man, as I say, with his hair a little stirred by a Zeitgeist\r\nthat made for change, Gates did at times display a disposition towards\r\ndevelopments. City Merchants had no modern side, and utilitarian spirits\r\nwere carping in the PALL MALL GAZETTE and elsewhere at the omissions\r\nfrom our curriculum, and particularly at our want of German. Moreover,\r\nfour classes still worked together with much clashing and uproar in the\r\nold Big Hall that had once held in a common tumult the entire school.\r\nGates used to come and talk to us older fellows about these things.\r\n\r\n“I don't wish to innovate unduly,” he used to say. “But we ought to get\r\nin some German, you know,--for those who like it. The army men will be\r\nwanting it some of these days.”\r\n\r\nHe referred to the organisation of regular evening preparation for the\r\nlower boys in Big Hall as a “revolutionary change,” but he achieved it,\r\nand he declared he began the replacement of the hacked wooden tables, at\r\nwhich the boys had worked since Tudor days, by sloping desks with safety\r\ninkpots and scientifically adjustable seats, “with grave misgivings.”\r\n And though he never birched a boy in his life, and was, I am convinced,\r\nmorally incapable of such a scuffle, he retained the block and birch in\r\nthe school through all his term of office, and spoke at the Headmasters'\r\nConference in temperate approval of corporal chastisement, comparing it,\r\ndear soul! to the power of the sword....\r\n\r\nI wish I could, in some measure and without tediousness, convey the\r\neffect of his discourses to General Assembly in Big Hall. But that\r\nis like trying to draw the obverse and reverse of a sixpence worn to\r\ncomplete illegibility. His tall fine figure stood high on the days, his\r\nthoughtful tenor filled the air as he steered his hazardous way\r\nthrough sentences that dragged inconclusive tails and dropped redundant\r\nprepositions. And he pleaded ever so urgently, ever so finely, that\r\nwhat we all knew for Sin was sinful, and on the whole best avoided\r\naltogether, and so went on with deepening notes and even with short\r\narresting gestures of the right arm and hand, to stir and exhort us\r\ntowards goodness, towards that modern, unsectarian goodness, goodness\r\nin general and nothing in particular, which the Zeitgeist seemed to\r\nindicate in those transitional years.\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nThe school never quite got hold of me. Partly I think that was because\r\nI was a day-boy and so freer than most of the boys, partly because of\r\na temperamental disposition to see things in my own way and have my\r\nprivate dreams, partly because I was a little antagonised by the family\r\ntraditions that ran through the school. I was made to feel at first\r\nthat I was a rank outsider, and I never quite forgot it. I suffered very\r\nlittle bullying, and I never had a fight--in all my time there were only\r\nthree fights--but I followed my own curiosities. I was already a\r\nvery keen theologian and politician before I was fifteen. I was also\r\nintensely interested in modern warfare. I read the morning papers in\r\nthe Reading Room during the midday recess, never missed the illustrated\r\nweeklies, and often when I could afford it I bought a PALL MALL GAZETTE\r\non my way home.\r\n\r\nI do not think that I was very exceptional in that; most intelligent\r\nboys, I believe, want naturally to be men, and are keenly interested\r\nin men's affairs. There is not the universal passion for a magnified\r\npuerility among them it is customary to assume. I was indeed a voracious\r\nreader of everything but boys' books--which I detested--and fiction. I\r\nread histories, travel, popular science and controversy with particular\r\nzest, and I loved maps. School work and school games were quite\r\nsubordinate affairs for me. I worked well and made a passable figure\r\nat games, and I do not think I was abnormally insensitive to the fine\r\nquality of our school, to the charm of its mediaeval nucleus, its\r\nGothic cloisters, its scraps of Palladian and its dignified Georgian\r\nextensions; the contrast of the old quiet, that in spite of our presence\r\npervaded it everywhere, with the rushing and impending London all\r\nabout it, was indeed a continual pleasure to me. But these things were\r\ncertainly not the living and central interests of my life.\r\n\r\nI had to conceal my wider outlook to a certain extent--from the masters\r\neven more than from the boys. Indeed I only let myself go freely with\r\none boy, Britten, my especial chum, the son of the Agent-General for\r\nEast Australia. We two discovered in a chance conversation A PROPOS of a\r\nmap in the library that we were both of us curious why there were Malays\r\nin Madagascar, and how the Mecca pilgrims came from the East Indies\r\nbefore steamships were available. Neither of us had suspected that\r\nthere was any one at all in the school who knew or cared a rap about the\r\nIndian Ocean, except as water on the way to India. But Britten had come\r\nup through the Suez Canal, and his ship had spoken a pilgrim ship on\r\nthe way. It gave him a startling quality of living knowledge. From these\r\npilgrims we got to a comparative treatment of religions, and from that,\r\nby a sudden plunge, to entirely sceptical and disrespectful confessions\r\nconcerning Gates' last outbreak of simple piety in School Assembly. We\r\nbecame congenial intimates from that hour.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of Britten happened to me when we were both in the Lower\r\nFifth. Previously there had been a watertight compartment between the\r\nbooks I read and the thoughts they begot on the one hand and human\r\nintercourse on the other. Now I really began my higher education, and\r\naired and examined and developed in conversation the doubts, the ideas,\r\nthe interpretations that had been forming in my mind. As we were both\r\nday-boys with a good deal of control over our time we organised walks\r\nand expeditions together, and my habit of solitary and rather vague\r\nprowling gave way to much more definite joint enterprises. I went\r\nseveral times to his house, he was the youngest of several brothers, one\r\nof whom was a medical student and let us assist at the dissection of a\r\ncat, and once or twice in vacation time he came to Penge, and we went\r\nwith parcels of provisions to do a thorough day in the grounds and\r\ngalleries of the Crystal Palace, ending with the fireworks at close\r\nquarters. We went in a river steamboat down to Greenwich, and fired by\r\nthat made an excursion to Margate and back; we explored London docks\r\nand Bethnal Green Museum, Petticoat Lane and all sorts of out-of-the-way\r\nplaces together.\r\n\r\nWe confessed shyly to one another a common secret vice, “Phantom\r\nwarfare.” When we walked alone, especially in the country, we had both\r\ndeveloped the same practice of fighting an imaginary battle about us\r\nas we walked. As we went along we were generals, and our attacks pushed\r\nalong on either side, crouching and gathering behind hedges, cresting\r\nridges, occupying copses, rushing open spaces, fighting from house to\r\nhouse. The hillsides about Penge were honeycombed in my imagination with\r\nthe pits and trenches I had created to check a victorious invader coming\r\nout of Surrey. For him West Kensington was chiefly important as the\r\nscene of a desperate and successful last stand of insurrectionary troops\r\n(who had seized the Navy, the Bank and other advantages) against a\r\nroyalist army--reinforced by Germans--advancing for reasons best known\r\nto themselves by way of Harrow and Ealing. It is a secret and solitary\r\ngame, as we found when we tried to play it together. We made a success\r\nof that only once. All the way down to Margate we schemed defences and\r\nassailed and fought them as we came back against the sunset. Afterwards\r\nwe recapitulated all that conflict by means of a large scale map of the\r\nThames and little paper ironclads in plan cut out of paper.\r\n\r\nA subsequent revival of these imaginings was brought about by Britten's\r\nluck in getting, through a friend of his father's, admission for us both\r\nto the spectacle of volunteer officers fighting the war game in Caxton\r\nHall. We developed a war game of our own at Britten's home with nearly a\r\ncouple of hundred lead soldiers, some excellent spring cannons that shot\r\nhard and true at six yards, hills of books and a constantly elaborated\r\nset of rules. For some months that occupied an immense proportion of\r\nour leisure. Some of our battles lasted several days. We kept the game a\r\nprofound secret from the other fellows. They would not have understood.\r\n\r\nAnd we also began, it was certainly before we were sixteen, to write,\r\nfor the sake of writing. We liked writing. We had discovered Lamb\r\nand the best of the middle articles in such weeklies as the SATURDAY\r\nGAZETTE, and we imitated them. Our minds were full of dim uncertain\r\nthings we wanted to drag out into the light of expression. Britten had\r\ngot hold of IN MEMORIAM, and I had disinterred Pope's ESSAY ON MAN and\r\nRABBI BEN EZRA, and these things had set our theological and cosmic\r\nsolicitudes talking. I was somewhere between sixteen and eighteen,\r\nI know, when he and I walked along the Thames Embankment confessing\r\nshamefully to one another that we had never read Lucretius. We thought\r\nevery one who mattered had read Lucretius.\r\n\r\nWhen I was nearly sixteen my mother was taken ill very suddenly,\r\nand died of some perplexing complaint that involved a post-mortem\r\nexamination; it was, I think, the trouble that has since those days\r\nbeen recognised as appendicitis. This led to a considerable change in\r\nmy circumstances; the house at Penge was given up, and my Staffordshire\r\nuncle arranged for me to lodge during school terms with a needy\r\nsolicitor and his wife in Vicars Street, S. W., about a mile and a half\r\nfrom the school. So it was I came right into London; I had almost two\r\nyears of London before I went to Cambridge.\r\n\r\nThose were our great days together. Afterwards we were torn apart;\r\nBritten went to Oxford, and our circumstances never afterwards threw us\r\ncontinuously together until the days of the BLUE WEEKLY.\r\n\r\nAs boys, we walked together, read and discussed the same books, pursued\r\nthe same enquiries. We got a reputation as inseparables and the nickname\r\nof the Rose and the Lily, for Britten was short and thick-set with\r\ndark close curling hair and a ruddy Irish type of face; I was lean and\r\nfair-haired and some inches taller than he. Our talk ranged widely and\r\nyet had certain very definite limitations. We were amazingly free with\r\npolitics and religion, we went to that little meeting-house of William\r\nMorris's at Hammersmith and worked out the principles of Socialism\r\npretty thoroughly, and we got up the Darwinian theory with the help\r\nof Britten's medical-student brother and the galleries of the Natural\r\nHistory Museum in Cromwell Road. Those wonderful cases on the ground\r\nfloor illustrating mimicry, dimorphism and so forth, were new in our\r\ntimes, and we went through them with earnest industry and tried over our\r\nDarwinism in the light of that. Such topics we did exhaustively. But on\r\nthe other hand I do not remember any discussion whatever of human sex or\r\nsexual relationships. There, in spite of intense secret curiosities, our\r\nlips were sealed by a peculiar shyness. And I do not believe we ever had\r\noccasion either of us to use the word “love.” It was not only that we\r\nwere instinctively shy of the subject, but that we were mightily ashamed\r\nof the extent of our ignorance and uncertainty in these matters. We\r\nevaded them elaborately with an assumption of exhaustive knowledge.\r\n\r\nWe certainly had no shyness about theology. We marked the emancipation\r\nof our spirits from the frightful teachings that had oppressed our\r\nboyhood, by much indulgence in blasphemous wit. We had a secret\r\nliterature of irreverent rhymes, and a secret art of theological\r\ncaricature. Britten's father had delighted his family by reading aloud\r\nfrom Dr. Richard Garnett's TWILIGHT OF THE GODS, and Britten conveyed\r\nthe precious volume to me. That and the BAB BALLADS were the inspiration\r\nof some of our earliest lucubrations.\r\n\r\nFor an imaginative boy the first experience of writing is like a tiger's\r\nfirst taste of blood, and our literary flowerings led very directly to\r\nthe revival of the school magazine, which had been comatose for some\r\nyears. But there we came upon a disappointment.\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\nIn that revival we associated certain other of the Sixth Form boys,\r\nand notably one for whom our enterprise was to lay the foundations of a\r\ncareer that has ended in the House of Lords, Arthur Cossington, now\r\nLord Paddockhurst. Cossington was at that time a rather heavy, rather\r\ngood-looking boy who was chiefly eminent in cricket, an outsider even as\r\nwe were and preoccupied no doubt, had we been sufficiently detached to\r\nobserve him, with private imaginings very much of the same quality\r\nand spirit as our own. He was, we were inclined to think, rather a\r\nsentimentalist, rather a poseur, he affected a concise emphatic style,\r\nplayed chess very well, betrayed a belief in will-power, and earned\r\nBritten's secret hostility, Britten being a sloven, by the invariable\r\nneatness of his collars and ties. He came into our magazine with a\r\nvigour that we found extremely surprising and unwelcome.\r\n\r\nBritten and I had wanted to write. We had indeed figured our project\r\nmodestly as a manuscript magazine of satirical, liberal and brilliant\r\nliterature by which in some rather inexplicable way the vague tumult of\r\nideas that teemed within us was to find form and expression; Cossington,\r\nit was manifest from the outset, wanted neither to write nor writing,\r\nbut a magazine. I remember the inaugural meeting in Shoesmith major's\r\nstudy--we had had great trouble in getting it together--and how\r\neffectually Cossington bolted with the proposal.\r\n\r\n“I think we fellows ought to run a magazine,” said Cossington. “The\r\nschool used to have one. A school like this ought to have a magazine.”\r\n\r\n“The last one died in '84,” said Shoesmith from the hearthrug. “Called\r\nthe OBSERVER. Rot rather.”\r\n\r\n“Bad title,” said Cossington.\r\n\r\n“There was a TATLER before that,” said Britten, sitting on the writing\r\ntable at the window that was closed to deaden the cries of the Lower\r\nSchool at play, and clashing his boots together.\r\n\r\n“We want something suggestive of City Merchants.”\r\n\r\n“CITY MERCHANDIZE,” said Britten.\r\n\r\n“Too fanciful. What of ARVONIAN? Richard Arvon was our founder, and it\r\nseems almost a duty--”\r\n\r\n“They call them all -usians or -onians,” said Britten.\r\n\r\n“I like CITY MERCHANDIZE,” I said. “We could probably find a quotation\r\nto suggest--oh! mixed good things.”\r\n\r\nCossington regarded me abstractedly.\r\n\r\n“Don't want to put the accent on the City, do we?” said Shoesmith, who\r\nhad a feeling for county families, and Naylor supported him by a murmur\r\nof approval.\r\n\r\n“We ought to call it the ARVONIAN,” decided Cossington, “and we might\r\nvery well have underneath, 'With which is incorporated the OBSERVER.'\r\nThat picks up the old traditions, makes an appeal to old boys and all\r\nthat, and it gives us something to print under the title.”\r\n\r\nI still held out for CITY MERCHANDIZE, which had taken my fancy. “Some\r\nof the chaps' people won't like it,” said Naylor, “certain not to. And\r\nit sounds Rum.”\r\n\r\n“Sounds Weird,” said a boy who had not hitherto spoken.\r\n\r\n“We aren't going to do anything Queer,” said Shoesmith, pointedly not\r\nlooking at Britten.\r\n\r\nThe question of the title had manifestly gone against us. “Oh! HAVE it\r\nARVONIAN,” I said.\r\n\r\n“And next, what size shall we have?” said Cossington.\r\n\r\n“Something like MACMILLAN'S MAGAZINE--or LONGMANS'; LONGMANS' is better\r\nbecause it has a whole page, not columns. It makes no end of difference\r\nto one's effects.”\r\n\r\n“What effects?” asked Shoesmith abruptly.\r\n\r\n“Oh! a pause or a white line or anything. You've got to write closer for\r\na double column. It's nuggetty. You can't get a swing on your prose.” I\r\nhad discussed this thoroughly with Britten.\r\n\r\n“If the fellows are going to write--” began Britten.\r\n\r\n“We ought to keep off fine writing,” said Shoesmith. “It's cheek. I vote\r\nwe don't have any.”\r\n\r\n“We sha'n't get any,” said Cossington, and then as an olive branch to\r\nme, “unless Remington does a bit. Or Britten. But it's no good making\r\ntoo much space for it.”\r\n\r\n“We ought to be very careful about the writing,” said Shoesmith. “We\r\ndon't want to give ourselves away.”\r\n\r\n“I vote we ask old Topham to see us through,” said Naylor.\r\n\r\nBritten groaned aloud and every one regarded him. “Greek epigrams on the\r\nfellows' names,” he said. “Small beer in ancient bottles. Let's get a\r\nstuffed broody hen to SIT on the magazine.”\r\n\r\n“We might do worse than a Greek epigram,” said Cossington. “One in each\r\nnumber. It--it impresses parents and keeps up our classical tradition.\r\nAnd the masters CAN help. We don't want to antagonise them. Of\r\ncourse--we've got to departmentalise. Writing is only one section of the\r\nthing. The ARVONIAN has to stand for the school. There's questions\r\nof space and questions of expense. We can't turn out a great chunk of\r\nprinted prose like--like wet cold toast and call it a magazine.”\r\n\r\nBritten writhed, appreciating the image.\r\n\r\n“There's to be a section of sports. YOU must do that.”\r\n\r\n“I'm not going to do any fine writing,” said Shoesmith.\r\n\r\n“What you've got to do is just to list all the chaps and put a note to\r\ntheir play:--'Naylor minor must pass more. Football isn't the place for\r\nextreme individualism.' 'Ammersham shapes well as half-back.' Things\r\nlike that.”\r\n\r\n“I could do that all right,” said Shoesmith, brightening and manifestly\r\nbecoming pregnant with judgments.\r\n\r\n“One great thing about a magazine of this sort,” said Cossington, “is\r\nto mention just as many names as you can in each number. It keeps the\r\ninterest alive. Chaps will turn it over looking for their own little\r\nbit. Then it all lights up for them.”\r\n\r\n“Do you want any reports of matches?” Shoesmith broke from his\r\nmeditation.\r\n\r\n“Rather. With comments.”\r\n\r\n“Naylor surpassed himself and negotiated the lemon safely home,” said\r\nShoesmith.\r\n\r\n“Shut it,” said Naylor modestly.\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” said Cossington. “That gives us three features,” touching\r\nthem off on his fingers, “Epigram, Literary Section, Sports. Then we\r\nwant a section to shove anything into, a joke, a notice of anything\r\nthat's going on. So on. Our Note Book.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Hell!” said Britten, and clashed his boots, to the silent\r\ndisapproval of every one.\r\n\r\n“Then we want an editorial.”\r\n\r\n“A WHAT?” cried Britten, with a note of real terror in his voice.\r\n\r\n“Well, don't we? Unless we have our Note Book to begin on the front\r\npage. It gives a scrappy effect to do that. We want something manly and\r\nstraightforward and a bit thoughtful, about Patriotism, say, or ESPRIT\r\nDE CORPS, or After-Life.”\r\n\r\nI looked at Britten. Hitherto we had not considered Cossington mattered\r\nvery much in the world.\r\n\r\nHe went over us as a motor-car goes over a dog. There was a sort of\r\nenergy about him, a new sort of energy to us; we had never realised\r\nthat anything of the sort existed in the world. We were hopelessly at\r\na disadvantage. Almost instantly we had developed a clear and detailed\r\nvision of a magazine made up of everything that was most acceptable\r\nin the magazines that flourished in the adult world about us, and had\r\ndetermined to make it a success. He had by a kind of instinct, as it\r\nwere, synthetically plagiarised every successful magazine and breathed\r\ninto this dusty mixture the breath of life. He was elected at his own\r\nsuggestion managing director, with the earnest support of Shoesmith and\r\nNaylor, and conducted the magazine so successfully and brilliantly that\r\nhe even got a whole back page of advertisements from the big sports shop\r\nin Holborn, and made the printers pay at the same rate for a notice\r\nof certain books of their own which they said they had inserted by\r\ninadvertency to fill up space. The only literary contribution in the\r\nfirst number was a column by Topham in faultless stereotyped English in\r\ndepreciation of some fancied evil called Utilitarian Studies and ending\r\nwith that noble old quotation:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“To the glory that was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Flack crowded us out of number two with a bright little paper on the\r\n“Humours of Cricket,” and the Head himself was profusely thoughtful all\r\nover the editorial under the heading of “The School Chapel; and How it\r\nSeems to an Old Boy.”\r\n\r\nBritten and I found it difficult to express to each other with any grace\r\nor precision what we felt about that magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FOURTH ~~ ADOLESCENCE\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nI find it very difficult to trace how form was added to form\r\nand interpretation followed interpretation in my ever-spreading,\r\never-deepening, ever-multiplying and enriching vision of this world into\r\nwhich I had been born. Every day added its impressions, its hints, its\r\nsubtle explications to the growing understanding. Day after day the\r\nliving interlacing threads of a mind weave together. Every morning now\r\nfor three weeks and more (for to-day is Thursday and I started on a\r\nTuesday) I have been trying to convey some idea of the factors and\r\nearly influences by which my particular scrap of subjective tapestry\r\nwas shaped, to show the child playing on the nursery floor, the son\r\nperplexed by his mother, gazing aghast at his dead father, exploring\r\ninterminable suburbs, touched by first intimations of the sexual\r\nmystery, coming in with a sort of confused avidity towards the centres\r\nof the life of London. It is only by such an effort to write it down\r\nthat one realises how marvellously crowded, how marvellously analytical\r\nand synthetic those ears must be. One begins with the little child\r\nto whom the sky is a roof of blue, the world a screen of opaque and\r\ndisconnected facts, the home a thing eternal, and “being good” just\r\nsimple obedience to unquestioned authority; and one comes at last to\r\nthe vast world of one's adult perception, pierced deep by flaring\r\nsearchlights of partial understanding, here masked by mists, here\r\nrefracted and distorted through half translucent veils, here showing\r\nbroad prospects and limitless vistas and here impenetrably dark.\r\n\r\nI recall phases of deep speculation, doubts and even prayers by night,\r\nand strange occasions when by a sort of hypnotic contemplation of\r\nnothingness I sought to pierce the web of appearances about me. It is\r\nhard to measure these things in receding perspective, and now I cannot\r\ntrace, so closely has mood succeeded and overlaid and obliterated mood,\r\nthe phases by which an utter horror of death was replaced by the growing\r\nrealisation of its necessity and dignity. Difficulty of the imagination\r\nwith infinite space, infinite time, entangled my mind; and moral\r\ndistress for the pain and suffering of bygone ages that made all thought\r\nof reformation in the future seem but the grimmest irony upon now\r\nirreparable wrongs. Many an intricate perplexity of these broadening\r\nyears did not so much get settled as cease to matter. Life crowded me\r\naway from it.\r\n\r\nI have confessed myself a temerarious theologian, and in that\r\npassage from boyhood to manhood I ranged widely in my search for some\r\npermanently satisfying Truth. That, too, ceased after a time to be\r\nurgently interesting. I came at last into a phase that endures to this\r\nday, of absolute tranquillity, of absolute confidence in whatever that\r\nIncomprehensible Comprehensive which must needs be the substratum of all\r\nthings, may be. Feeling OF IT, feeling BY IT, I cannot feel afraid of\r\nit. I think I had got quite clearly and finally to that adjustment long\r\nbefore my Cambridge days were done. I am sure that the evil in life is\r\ntransitory and finite like an accident or distress in the nursery; that\r\nGod is my Father and that I may trust Him, even though life hurts so\r\nthat one must needs cry out at it, even though it shows no consequence\r\nbut failure, no promise but pain....\r\n\r\nBut while I was fearless of theology I must confess it was comparatively\r\nlate before I faced and dared to probe the secrecies of sex. I was\r\nafraid of sex. I had an instinctive perception that it would be a large\r\nand difficult thing in my life, but my early training was all in\r\nthe direction of regarding it as an irrelevant thing, as something\r\ndisconnected from all the broad significances of life, as hostile\r\nand disgraceful in its quality. The world was never so emasculated in\r\nthought, I suppose, as it was in the Victorian time....\r\n\r\nI was afraid to think either of sex or (what I have always found\r\ninseparable from a kind of sexual emotion) beauty. Even as a boy I knew\r\nthe thing as a haunting and alluring mystery that I tried to keep away\r\nfrom. Its dim presence obsessed me none the less for all the extravagant\r\ndecency, the stimulating silences of my upbringing....\r\n\r\nThe plaster Venuses and Apollos that used to adorn the vast aisle and\r\nhuge grey terraces of the Crystal Palace were the first intimations of\r\nthe beauty of the body that ever came into my life. As I write of it I\r\nfeel again the shameful attraction of those gracious forms. I used to\r\nlook at them not simply, but curiously and askance. Once at least in\r\nmy later days at Penge, I spent a shilling in admission chiefly for the\r\nsake of them....\r\n\r\nThe strangest thing of all my odd and solitary upbringing seems to me\r\nnow that swathing up of all the splendours of the flesh, that strange\r\ncombination of fanatical terrorism and shyness that fenced me about with\r\nprohibitions. It caused me to grow up, I will not say blankly ignorant,\r\nbut with an ignorance blurred and dishonoured by shame, by enigmatical\r\nwarnings, by cultivated aversions, an ignorance in which a fascinated\r\ncuriosity and desire struggled like a thing in a net. I knew so little\r\nand I felt so much. There was indeed no Aphrodite at all in my youthful\r\nPantheon, but instead there was a mysterious and minatory gap. I have\r\ntold how at last a new Venus was born in my imagination out of gas lamps\r\nand the twilight, a Venus with a cockney accent and dark eyes shining\r\nout of the dusk, a Venus who was a warm, passion-stirring atmosphere\r\nrather than incarnate in a body. And I have told, too, how I bought a\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nAll this was a thing apart from the rest of my life, a locked avoided\r\nchamber....\r\n\r\nIt was not until my last year at Trinity that I really broke down the\r\nbarriers of this unwholesome silence and brought my secret broodings to\r\nthe light of day. Then a little set of us plunged suddenly into what\r\nwe called at first sociological discussion. I can still recall even the\r\nphysical feeling of those first tentative talks. I remember them mostly\r\nas occurring in the rooms of Ted Hatherleigh, who kept at the corner by\r\nthe Trinity great gate, but we also used to talk a good deal at a man's\r\nin King's, a man named, if I remember rightly, Redmayne. The atmosphere\r\nof Hatherleigh's rooms was a haze of tobacco smoke against a background\r\nbrown and deep. He professed himself a socialist with anarchistic\r\nleanings--he had suffered the martyrdom of ducking for it--and a huge\r\nFrench May-day poster displaying a splendid proletarian in red and black\r\non a barricade against a flaring orange sky, dominated his decorations.\r\nHatherleigh affected a fine untidiness, and all the place, even\r\nthe floor, was littered with books, for the most part open and face\r\ndownward; deeper darknesses were supplied by a discarded gown and\r\nour caps, all conscientiously battered, Hatherleigh's flopped like an\r\nelephant's ear and inserted quill pens supported the corners of mine;\r\nthe highlights of the picture came chiefly as reflections from his\r\nchequered blue mugs full of audit ale. We sat on oak chairs, except the\r\nfour or five who crowded on a capacious settle, we drank a lot of beer\r\nand were often fuddled, and occasionally quite drunk, and we all smoked\r\nreckless-looking pipes,--there was a transient fashion among us for corn\r\ncobs for which Mark Twain, I think, was responsible. Our little excesses\r\nwith liquor were due far more to conscience than appetite, indicated\r\nchiefly a resolve to break away from restraints that we suspected were\r\nkeeping us off the instructive knife-edges of life. Hatherleigh was a\r\ngood Englishman of the premature type with a red face, a lot of hair, a\r\ndeep voice and an explosive plunging manner, and it was he who said one\r\nevening--Heaven knows how we got to it--“Look here, you know, it's all\r\nRot, this Shutting Up about Women. We OUGHT to talk about them. What are\r\nwe going to do about them? It's got to come. We're all festering inside\r\nabout it. Let's out with it. There's too much Decency altogether about\r\nthis Infernal University!”\r\n\r\nWe rose to his challenge a little awkwardly and our first talk\r\nwas clumsy, there were flushed faces and red ears, and I remember\r\nHatherleigh broke out into a monologue on decency. “Modesty and\r\nDecency,” said Hatherleigh, “are Oriental vices. The Jews brought them\r\nto Europe. They're Semitic, just like our monasticism here and the\r\nseclusion of women and mutilating the dead on a battlefield. And all\r\nthat sort of thing.”\r\n\r\nHatherleigh's mind progressed by huge leaps, leaps that were usually\r\nwildly inaccurate, and for a time we engaged hotly upon the topic of\r\nthose alleged mutilations and the Semitic responsibility for decency.\r\nHatherleigh tried hard to saddle the Semitic race with the less elegant\r\nwar customs of the Soudan and the northwest frontier of India, and\r\nquoted Doughty, at that time a little-known author, and Cunninghame\r\nGraham to show that the Arab was worse than a county-town spinster in\r\nhis regard for respectability. But his case was too preposterous, and\r\nEsmeer, with his shrill penetrating voice and his way of pointing with\r\nall four long fingers flat together, carried the point against him. He\r\nquoted Cato and Roman law and the monasteries of Thibet.\r\n\r\n“Well, anyway,” said Hatherleigh, escaping from our hands like an\r\nintellectual frog, “Semitic or not, I've got no use for decency.”\r\n\r\nWe argued points and Hatherleigh professed an unusually balanced and\r\ntolerating attitude. “I don't mind a certain refinement and dignity,” he\r\nadmitted generously. “What I object to is this spreading out of decency\r\nuntil it darkens the whole sky, until it makes a man's father afraid to\r\nspeak of the most important things, until it makes a man afraid to look\r\na frank book in the face or think--even think! until it leads to our\r\ncoming to--to the business at last with nothing but a few prohibitions,\r\na few hints, a lot of dirty jokes and, and “--he waved a hand and seemed\r\nto seek and catch his image in the air--“oh, a confounded buttered slide\r\nof sentiment, to guide us. I tell you I'm going to think about it and\r\ntalk about it until I see a little more daylight than I do at present.\r\nI'm twenty-two. Things might happen to me anywhen. You men can go out\r\ninto the world if you like, to sin like fools and marry like fools,\r\nnot knowing what you are doing and ashamed to ask. You'll take\r\nthe consequences, too, I expect, pretty meekly, sniggering a bit,\r\nsentimentalising a bit, like--like Cambridge humorists.... I mean to\r\nknow what I'm doing.”\r\n\r\nHe paused to drink, and I think I cut in with ideas of my own. But one\r\nis apt to forget one's own share in a talk, I find, more than one does\r\nthe clear-cut objectivity of other people's, and I do not know how far\r\nI contributed to this discussion that followed. I am, however, pretty\r\ncertain that it was then that ideal that we were pleased to call\r\naristocracy and which soon became the common property of our set was\r\ndeveloped. It was Esmeer, I know, who laid down and maintained the\r\nproposition that so far as minds went there were really only two sorts\r\nof man in the world, the aristocrat and the man who subdues his mind to\r\nother people's.\r\n\r\n“'I couldn't THINK of it, Sir,'” said Esmeer in his elucidatory tones;\r\n“that's what a servant says. His mind even is broken in to run between\r\nfences, and he admits it. WE'VE got to be able to think of anything.\r\nAnd 'such things aren't for the Likes of Us!' That's another servant's\r\nsaying. Well, everything IS for the Likes of Us. If we see fit, that\r\nis.”\r\n\r\nA small fresh-coloured man in grey objected.\r\n\r\n“Well,” exploded Hatherleigh, “if that isn't so what the deuce are we\r\nup here for? Instead of working in mines? If some things aren't to be\r\nthought about ever! We've got the privilege of all these extra years for\r\ngetting things straight in our heads, and then we won't use 'em. Good\r\nGod! what do you think a university's for?”...\r\n\r\nEsmeer's idea came with an effect of real emancipation to several of\r\nus. We were not going to be afraid of ideas any longer, we were going\r\nto throw down every barrier of prohibition and take them in and see what\r\ncame of it. We became for a time even intemperately experimental, and\r\none of us, at the bare suggestion of an eminent psychic investigator,\r\ntook hashish and very nearly died of it within a fortnight of our great\r\nelucidation.\r\n\r\nThe chief matter of our interchanges was of course the discussion\r\nof sex. Once the theme had been opened it became a sore place in\r\nour intercourse; none of us seemed able to keep away from it. Our\r\nimaginations got astir with it. We made up for lost time and went\r\nround it and through it and over it exhaustively. I recall prolonged\r\ndiscussion of polygamy on the way to Royston, muddy November tramps to\r\nMadingley, when amidst much profanity from Hatherleigh at the serious\r\ntreatment of so obsolete a matter, we weighed the reasons, if any, for\r\nthe institution of marriage. The fine dim night-time spaces of the Great\r\nCourt are bound up with the inconclusive finales of mighty hot-eared\r\nwrangles; the narrows of Trinity Street and Petty Cury and Market Hill\r\nhave their particular associations for me with that spate of confession\r\nand free speech, that almost painful goal delivery of long pent and\r\ncrappled and sometimes crippled ideas.\r\n\r\nAnd we went on a reading party that Easter to a place called Pulborough\r\nin Sussex, where there is a fishing inn and a river that goes under a\r\nbridge. It was a late Easter and a blazing one, and we boated and bathed\r\nand talked of being Hellenic and the beauty of the body until at moments\r\nit seemed to us that we were destined to restore the Golden Age, by the\r\nsimple abolition of tailors and outfitters.\r\n\r\nThose undergraduate talks! how rich and glorious they seemed, how\r\nsplendidly new the ideas that grew and multiplied in our seething minds!\r\nWe made long afternoon and evening raids over the Downs towards Arundel,\r\nand would come tramping back through the still keen moonlight singing\r\nand shouting. We formed romantic friendships with one another, and\r\ngrieved more or less convincingly that there were no splendid women fit\r\nto be our companions in the world. But Hatherleigh, it seemed, had once\r\nknown a girl whose hair was gloriously red. “My God!” said Hatherleigh\r\nto convey the quality of her; just simply and with projectile violence:\r\n“My God!”\r\n\r\nBenton had heard of a woman who lived with a man refusing to be married\r\nto him--we thought that splendid beyond measure,--I cannot now imagine\r\nwhy. She was “like a tender goddess,” Benton said. A sort of shame\r\ncame upon us in the dark in spite of our liberal intentions when Benton\r\ncommitted himself to that. And after such talk we would fall upon great\r\npauses of emotional dreaming, and if by chance we passed a girl in a\r\ngoverness cart, or some farmer's daughter walking to the station, we\r\nbecame alertly silent or obstreperously indifferent to her. For might\r\nshe not be just that one exception to the banal decency, the sickly\r\npointless conventionality, the sham modesty of the times in which we\r\nlived?\r\n\r\nWe felt we stood for a new movement, not realising how perennially this\r\nsame emancipation returns to those ancient courts beside the Cam.\r\nWe were the anti-decency party, we discovered a catch phrase that we\r\nflourished about in the Union and made our watchword, namely, “stark\r\nfact.” We hung nude pictures in our rooms much as if they had been\r\nflags, to the earnest concern of our bedders, and I disinterred my\r\nlong-kept engraving and had it framed in fumed oak, and found for it a\r\ncompleter and less restrained companion, a companion I never cared for\r\nin the slightest degree....\r\n\r\nThis efflorescence did not prevent, I think indeed it rather helped, our\r\nmore formal university work, for most of us took firsts, and three of\r\nus got Fellowships in one year or another. There was Benton who had a\r\nResearch Fellowship and went to Tubingen, there was Esmeer and myself\r\nwho both became Residential Fellows. I had taken the Mental and\r\nMoral Science Tripos (as it was then), and three years later I got a\r\nlectureship in political science. In those days it was disguised in the\r\ncloak of Political Economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was our affectation to be a little detached from the main stream of\r\nundergraduate life. We worked pretty hard, but by virtue of our\r\nbeer, our socialism and suchlike heterodoxy, held ourselves to be\r\ndifferentiated from the swatting reading man. None of us, except Baxter,\r\nwho was a rowing blue, a rather abnormal blue with an appetite for\r\nideas, took games seriously enough to train, and on the other hand\r\nwe intimated contempt for the rather mediocre, deliberately humorous,\r\nconsciously gentlemanly and consciously wild undergraduate men who\r\nmade up the mass of Cambridge life. After the manner of youth we were\r\naltogether too hard on our contemporaries. We battered our caps and\r\ntore our gowns lest they should seem new, and we despised these others\r\nextremely for doing exactly the same things; we had an idea of ourselves\r\nand resented beyond measure a similar weakness in these our brothers.\r\n\r\nThere was a type, or at least there seemed to us to be a type--I'm a\r\nlittle doubtful at times now whether after all we didn't create it--for\r\nwhich Hatherleigh invented the nickname the “Pinky Dinkys,” intending\r\nthereby both contempt and abhorrence in almost equal measure. The Pinky\r\nDinky summarised all that we particularly did not want to be, and also,\r\nI now perceive, much of what we were and all that we secretly dreaded\r\nbecoming.\r\n\r\nBut it is hard to convey the Pinky Dinky idea, for all that it meant so\r\nmuch to us. We spent one evening at least during that reading party upon\r\nthe Pinky Dinky; we sat about our one fire after a walk in the\r\nrain--it was our only wet day--smoked our excessively virile pipes, and\r\nelaborated the natural history of the Pinky Dinky. We improvised a\r\nsort of Pinky Dinky litany, and Hatherleigh supplied deep notes for the\r\nresponses.\r\n\r\n“The Pinky Dinky extracts a good deal of amusement from life,” said some\r\none.\r\n\r\n“Damned prig!” said Hatherleigh.\r\n\r\n“The Pinky Dinky arises in the Union and treats the question with a\r\nlight gay touch. He makes the weird ones mad. But sometimes he cannot go\r\non because of the amusement he extracts.”\r\n\r\n“I want to shy books at the giggling swine,” said Hatherleigh.\r\n\r\n“The Pinky Dinky says suddenly while he is making the tea, 'We're all\r\nbeing frightfully funny. It's time for you to say something now.'”\r\n\r\n“The Pinky Dinky shakes his head and says: 'I'm afraid I shall never be\r\na responsible being.' And he really IS frivolous.”\r\n\r\n“Frivolous but not vulgar,” said Esmeer.\r\n\r\n“Pinky Dinkys are chaps who've had their buds nipped,” said Hatherleigh.\r\n“They're Plebs and they know it. They haven't the Guts to get hold of\r\nthings. And so they worry up all those silly little jokes of theirs to\r\ncarry it off.”...\r\n\r\nWe tried bad ones for a time, viciously flavoured.\r\n\r\nPinky Dinkys are due to over-production of the type that ought to keep\r\noutfitters' shops. Pinky Dinkys would like to keep outfitters' shops\r\nwith whimsy 'scriptions on the boxes and make your bill out funny, and\r\nnot be snobs to customers, no!--not even if they had titles.”\r\n\r\n“Every Pinky Dinky's people are rather good people, and better than most\r\nPinky Dinky's people. But he does not put on side.”\r\n\r\n“Pinky Dinkys become playful at the sight of women.”\r\n\r\n“'Croquet's my game,' said the Pinky Dinky, and felt a man\r\ncondescended.”\r\n\r\n“But what the devil do they think they're up to, anyhow?” roared old\r\nHatherleigh suddenly, dropping plump into bottomless despair.\r\n\r\nWe felt we had still failed to get at the core of the mystery of the\r\nPinky Dinky.\r\n\r\nWe tried over things about his religion. “The Pinky Dinky goes to King's\r\nChapel, and sits and feels in the dusk. Solemn things! Oh HUSH! He\r\nwouldn't tell you--”\r\n\r\n“He COULDN'T tell you.”\r\n\r\n“Religion is so sacred to him he never talks about it, never reads about\r\nit, never thinks about it. Just feels!”\r\n\r\n“But in his heart of hearts, oh! ever so deep, the Pinky Dinky has a\r\ndoubt--”\r\n\r\nSome one protested.\r\n\r\n“Not a vulgar doubt,” Esmeer went on, “but a kind of hesitation whether\r\nthe Ancient of Days is really exactly what one would call good form....\r\nThere's a lot of horrid coarseness got into the world somehow. SOMEBODY\r\nput it there.... And anyhow there's no particular reason why a man\r\nshould be seen about with Him. He's jolly Awful of course and all\r\nthat--”\r\n\r\n“The Pinky Dinky for all his fun and levity has a clean mind.”\r\n\r\n“A thoroughly clean mind. Not like Esmeer's--the Pig!”\r\n\r\n“If once he began to think about sex, how could he be comfortable at\r\ncroquet?”\r\n\r\n“It's their Damned Modesty,” said Hatherleigh suddenly, “that's what's\r\nthe matter with the Pinky Dinky. It's Mental Cowardice dressed up as a\r\nvirtue and taking the poor dears in. Cambridge is soaked with it; it's\r\nsome confounded local bacillus. Like the thing that gives a flavour to\r\nHavana cigars. He comes up here to be made into a man and a ruler of\r\nthe people, and he thinks it shows a nice disposition not to take on the\r\njob! How the Devil is a great Empire to be run with men like him?”\r\n\r\n“All his little jokes and things,” said Esmeer regarding his feet on\r\nthe fender, “it's just a nervous sniggering--because he's afraid....\r\nOxford's no better.”\r\n\r\n“What's he afraid of?” said I.\r\n\r\n“God knows!” exploded Hatherleigh and stared at the fire.\r\n\r\n“LIFE!” said Esmeer. “And so in a way are we,” he added, and made a\r\nthoughtful silence for a time.\r\n\r\n“I say,” began Carter, who was doing the Natural Science Tripos, “what\r\nis the adult form of the Pinky Dinky?”\r\n\r\nBut there we were checked by our ignorance of the world.\r\n\r\n“What is the adult form of any of us?” asked Benton, voicing the thought\r\nthat had arrested our flow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not remember that we ever lifted our criticism to the dons and the\r\norganisation of the University. I think we took them for granted. When I\r\nlook back at my youth I am always astonished by the multitude of things\r\nthat we took for granted. It seemed to us that Cambridge was in the\r\norder of things, for all the world like having eyebrows or a vermiform\r\nappendix. Now with the larger scepticism of middle age I can entertain\r\nvery fundamental doubts about these old universities. Indeed I had a\r\nscheme--\r\n\r\nI do not see what harm I can do now by laying bare the purpose of the\r\npolitical combinations I was trying to effect.\r\n\r\nMy educational scheme was indeed the starting-point of all the big\r\nproject of conscious public reconstruction at which I aimed. I wanted\r\nto build up a new educational machine altogether for the governing class\r\nout of a consolidated system of special public service schools. I\r\nmeant to get to work upon this whatever office I was given in the new\r\ngovernment. I could have begun my plan from the Admiralty or the\r\nWar Office quite as easily as from the Education Office. I am firmly\r\nconvinced it is hopeless to think of reforming the old public schools\r\nand universities to meet the needs of a modern state, they send their\r\nroots too deep and far, the cost would exceed any good that could\r\npossibly be effected, and so I have sought a way round this invincible\r\nobstacle. I do think it would be quite practicable to side-track, as the\r\nAmericans say, the whole system by creating hardworking, hard-living,\r\nmodern and scientific boys' schools, first for the Royal Navy and then\r\nfor the public service generally, and as they grew, opening them to\r\nthe public without any absolute obligation to subsequent service.\r\nSimultaneously with this it would not be impossible to develop a new\r\ncollege system with strong faculties in modern philosophy, modern\r\nhistory, European literature and criticism, physical and biological\r\nscience, education and sociology.\r\n\r\nWe could in fact create a new liberal education in this way, and cut the\r\numbilicus of the classical languages for good and all. I should have set\r\nthis going, and trusted it to correct or kill the old public schools and\r\nthe Oxford and Cambridge tradition altogether. I had men in my mind to\r\nbegin the work, and I should have found others. I should have aimed at\r\nmaking a hard-trained, capable, intellectually active, proud type of\r\nman. Everything else would have been made subservient to that. I should\r\nhave kept my grip on the men through their vacation, and somehow or\r\nother I would have contrived a young woman to match them. I think I\r\ncould have seen to it effectually enough that they didn't get at croquet\r\nand tennis with the vicarage daughters and discover sex in the Peeping\r\nTom fashion I did, and that they realised quite early in life that\r\nit isn't really virile to reek of tobacco. I should have had military\r\nmanoeuvres, training ships, aeroplane work, mountaineering and so forth,\r\nin the place of the solemn trivialities of games, and I should have fed\r\nand housed my men clean and very hard--where there wasn't any audit ale,\r\nno credit tradesmen, and plenty of high pressure douches....\r\n\r\nI have revisited Cambridge and Oxford time after time since I came\r\ndown, and so far as the Empire goes, I want to get clear of those two\r\nplaces....\r\n\r\nAlways I renew my old feelings, a physical oppression, a sense of\r\nlowness and dampness almost exactly like the feeling of an underground\r\nroom where paper moulders and leaves the wall, a feeling of ineradicable\r\ncontagion in the Gothic buildings, in the narrow ditch-like rivers, in\r\nthose roads and roads of stuffy little villas. Those little villas\r\nhave destroyed all the good of the old monastic system and none of its\r\nevil....\r\n\r\nSome of the most charming people in the world live in them, but their\r\ncollective effect is below the quality of any individual among them.\r\nCambridge is a world of subdued tones, of excessively subtle humours, of\r\nprim conduct and free thinking; it fears the Parent, but it has no fear\r\nof God; it offers amidst surroundings that vary between disguises and\r\nantiquarian charm the inflammation of literature's purple draught;\r\none hears there a peculiar thin scandal like no other scandal in the\r\nworld--a covetous scandal--so that I am always reminded of Ibsen in\r\nCambridge. In Cambridge and the plays of Ibsen alone does it seem\r\nappropriate for the heroine before the great crisis of life to “enter,\r\ntake off her overshoes, and put her wet umbrella upon the writing\r\ndesk.”...\r\n\r\nWe have to make a new Academic mind for modern needs, and the last thing\r\nto make it out of, I am convinced, is the old Academic mind. One\r\nmight as soon try to fake the old VICTORY at Portsmouth into a line of\r\nbattleship again. Besides which the old Academic mind, like those old\r\nbathless, damp Gothic colleges, is much too delightful in its peculiar\r\nand distinctive way to damage by futile patching.\r\n\r\nMy heart warms to a sense of affectionate absurdity as I recall dear old\r\nCodger, surely the most “unleaderly” of men. No more than from the old\r\nSchoolmen, his kindred, could one get from him a School for Princes.\r\nYet apart from his teaching he was as curious and adorable as a good\r\nNetsuke. Until quite recently he was a power in Cambridge, he could\r\nmake and bar and destroy, and in a way he has become the quintessence of\r\nCambridge in my thoughts.\r\n\r\nI see him on his way to the morning's lecture, with his plump childish\r\nface, his round innocent eyes, his absurdly non-prehensile fat hand\r\ncarrying his cap, his grey trousers braced up much too high, his feet a\r\ntrifle inturned, and going across the great court with a queer tripping\r\npace that seemed cultivated even to my naive undergraduate eye. Or I\r\nsee him lecturing. He lectured walking up and down between the desks,\r\ntalking in a fluting rapid voice, and with the utmost lucidity. If he\r\ncould not walk up and down he could not lecture. His mind and voice had\r\nprecisely the fluid quality of some clear subtle liquid; one felt it\r\ncould flow round anything and overcome nothing. And its nimble eddies\r\nwere wonderful! Or again I recall him drinking port with little muscular\r\nmovements in his neck and cheek and chin and his brows knit--very\r\njudicial, very concentrated, preparing to say the apt just thing; it was\r\nthe last thing he would have told a lie about.\r\n\r\nWhen I think of Codger I am reminded of an inscription I saw on some\r\noccasion in Regent's Park above two eyes scarcely more limpidly innocent\r\nthan his--“Born in the Menagerie.” Never once since Codger began to\r\ndisplay the early promise of scholarship at the age of eight or more,\r\nhad he been outside the bars. His utmost travel had been to lecture here\r\nand lecture there. His student phase had culminated in papers of quite\r\nexceptional brilliance, and he had gone on to lecture with a cheerful\r\ncombination of wit and mannerism that had made him a success from the\r\nbeginning. He has lectured ever since. He lectures still. Year by year\r\nhe has become plumper, more rubicund and more and more of an item for\r\nthe intelligent visitor to see. Even in my time he was pointed out to\r\npeople as part of our innumerable enrichments, and obviously he knew it.\r\nHe has become now almost the leading Character in a little donnish world\r\nof much too intensely appreciated Characters.\r\n\r\nHe boasted he took no exercise, and also of his knowledge of port wine.\r\nOf other wines he confessed quite frankly he had no “special knowledge.”\r\n Beyond these things he had little pride except that he claimed to have\r\nread every novel by a woman writer that had ever entered the Union\r\nLibrary. This, however, he held to be remarkable rather than ennobling,\r\nand such boasts as he made of it were tinged with playfulness. Certainly\r\nhe had a scholar's knowledge of the works of Miss Marie Corelli, Miss\r\nBraddon, Miss Elizabeth Glyn and Madame Sarah Grand that would have\r\nastonished and flattered those ladies enormously, and he loved nothing\r\nso much in his hours of relaxation as to propound and answer difficult\r\nquestions upon their books. Tusher of King's was his ineffectual rival\r\nin this field, their bouts were memorable and rarely other than glorious\r\nfor Codger; but then Tusher spread himself too much, he also undertook\r\nto rehearse whole pages out of Bradshaw, and tell you with all the\r\nchanges how to get from any station to any station in Great Britain by\r\nthe nearest and cheapest routes....\r\n\r\nCodger lodged with a little deaf innocent old lady, Mrs. Araminta\r\nMergle, who was understood to be herself a very redoubtable Character in\r\nthe Gyp-Bedder class; about her he related quietly absurd anecdotes.\r\nHe displayed a marvellous invention in ascribing to her plausible\r\nexpressions of opinion entirely identical in import with those of the\r\nOxford and Harvard Pragmatists, against whom he waged a fierce obscure\r\nwar....\r\n\r\nIt was Codger's function to teach me philosophy, philosophy! the\r\nintimate wisdom of things. He dealt in a variety of Hegelian stuff like\r\nnothing else in the world, but marvellously consistent with itself. It\r\nwas a wonderful web he spun out of that queer big active childish brain\r\nthat had never lusted nor hated nor grieved nor feared nor passionately\r\nloved,--a web of iridescent threads. He had luminous final theories\r\nabout Love and Death and Immortality, odd matters they seemed for him to\r\nthink about! and all his woven thoughts lay across my perception of the\r\nrealities of things, as flimsy and irrelevant and clever and beautiful,\r\noh!--as a dew-wet spider's web slung in the morning sunshine across the\r\nblack mouth of a gun....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\nAll through those years of development I perceive now there must have\r\nbeen growing in me, slowly, irregularly, assimilating to itself all\r\nthe phrases and forms of patriotism, diverting my religious impulses,\r\nutilising my esthetic tendencies, my dominating idea, the statesman's\r\nidea, that idea of social service which is the protagonist of my story,\r\nthat real though complex passion for Making, making widely and greatly,\r\ncities, national order, civilisation, whose interplay with all those\r\nother factors in life I have set out to present. It was growing in\r\nme--as one's bones grow, no man intending it.\r\n\r\nI have tried to show how, quite early in my life, the fact of\r\ndisorderliness, the conception of social life as being a multitudinous\r\nconfusion out of hand, came to me. One always of course simplifies these\r\nthings in the telling, but I do not think I ever saw the world at large\r\nin any other terms. I never at any stage entertained the idea\r\nwhich sustained my mother, and which sustains so many people in the\r\nworld,--the idea that the universe, whatever superficial discords it\r\nmay present, is as a matter of fact “all right,” is being steered to\r\ndefinite ends by a serene and unquestionable God. My mother thought that\r\nOrder prevailed, and that disorder was just incidental and foredoomed\r\nrebellion; I feel and have always felt that order rebels against and\r\nstruggles against disorder, that order has an up-hill job, in gardens,\r\nexperiments, suburbs, everything alike; from the very beginnings of my\r\nexperience I discovered hostility to order, a constant escaping from\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nThe current of living and contemporary ideas in which my mind was\r\npresently swimming made all in the same direction; in place of my\r\nmother's attentive, meticulous but occasionally extremely irascible\r\nProvidence, the talk was all of the Struggle for Existence and the\r\nsurvival not of the Best--that was nonsense, but of the fittest to\r\nsurvive.\r\n\r\nThe attempts to rehabilitate Faith in the form of the Individualist's\r\nLAISSEZ FAIRE never won upon me. I disliked Herbert Spencer all my life\r\nuntil I read his autobiography, and then I laughed a little and loved\r\nhim. I remember as early as the City Merchants' days how Britten and I\r\nscoffed at that pompous question-begging word “Evolution,” having, so to\r\nspeak, found it out. Evolution, some illuminating talker had remarked at\r\nthe Britten lunch table, had led not only to man, but to the liver-fluke\r\nand skunk, obviously it might lead anywhere; order came into things only\r\nthrough the struggling mind of man. That lit things wonderfully for\r\nus. When I went up to Cambridge I was perfectly clear that life was\r\na various and splendid disorder of forces that the spirit of man sets\r\nitself to tame. I have never since fallen away from that persuasion.\r\n\r\nI do not think I was exceptionally precocious in reaching these\r\nconclusions and a sort of religious finality for myself by eighteen or\r\nnineteen. I know men and women vary very much in these matters, just as\r\nchildren do in learning to talk. Some will chatter at eighteen months\r\nand some will hardly speak until three, and the thing has very little\r\nto do with their subsequent mental quality. So it is with young people;\r\nsome will begin their religious, their social, their sexual interests at\r\nfourteen, some not until far on in the twenties. Britten and I belonged\r\nto one of the precocious types, and Cossington very probably to another.\r\nIt wasn't that there was anything priggish about any of us; we should\r\nhave been prigs to have concealed our spontaneous interests and ape the\r\ntheoretical boy.\r\n\r\nThe world of man centred for my imagination in London, it still centres\r\nthere; the real and present world, that is to say, as distinguished from\r\nthe wonder-lands of atomic and microscopic science and the stars and\r\nfuture time. I had travelled scarcely at all, I had never crossed the\r\nChannel, but I had read copiously and I had formed a very good working\r\nidea of this round globe with its mountains and wildernesses and forests\r\nand all the sorts and conditions of human life that were scattered over\r\nits surface. It was all alive, I felt, and changing every day; how it\r\nwas changing, and the changes men might bring about, fascinated my mind\r\nbeyond measure.\r\n\r\nI used to find a charm in old maps that showed The World as Known to the\r\nAncients, and I wish I could now without any suspicion of self-deception\r\nwrite down compactly the world as it was known to me at nineteen. So\r\nfar as extension went it was, I fancy, very like the world I know now at\r\nforty-two; I had practically all the mountains and seas, boundaries and\r\nraces, products and possibilities that I have now. But its intension was\r\nvery different. All the interval has been increasing and deepening my\r\nsocial knowledge, replacing crude and second-hand impressions by felt\r\nand realised distinctions.\r\n\r\nIn 1895--that was my last year with Britten, for I went up to Cambridge\r\nin September--my vision of the world had much the same relation to the\r\nvision I have to-day that an ill-drawn daub of a mask has to the direct\r\nvision of a human face. Britten and I looked at our world and saw--what\r\ndid we see? Forms and colours side by side that we had no suspicion were\r\ninterdependent. We had no conception of the roots of things nor of the\r\nreaction of things. It did not seem to us, for example, that business\r\nhad anything to do with government, or that money and means affected the\r\nheroic issues of war. There were no wagons in our war game, and where\r\nthere were guns, there it was assumed the ammunition was gathered\r\ntogether. Finance again was a sealed book to us; we did not so much\r\nconnect it with the broad aspects of human affairs as regard it as a\r\nsort of intrusive nuisance to be earnestly ignored by all right-minded\r\nmen. We had no conception of the quality of politics, nor how\r\n“interests” came into such affairs; we believed men were swayed by\r\npurely intellectual convictions and were either right or wrong, honest\r\nor dishonest (in which case they deserved to be shot), good or bad. We\r\nknew nothing of mental inertia, and could imagine the opinion of a whole\r\nnation changed by one lucid and convincing exposition. We were capable\r\nof the most incongruous transfers from the scroll of history to our own\r\ntimes, we could suppose Brixton ravaged and Hampstead burnt in civil\r\nwars for the succession to the throne, or Cheapside a lane of death and\r\nthe front of the Mansion House set about with guillotines in the course\r\nof an accurately transposed French Revolution. We rebuilt London by Act\r\nof Parliament, and once in a mood of hygienic enterprise we transferred\r\nits population EN MASSE to the North Downs by an order of the Local\r\nGovernment Board. We thought nothing of throwing religious organisations\r\nout of employment or superseding all the newspapers by freely\r\ndistributed bulletins. We could contemplate the possibility of laws\r\nabolishing whole classes; we were equal to such a dream as the peaceful\r\nand orderly proclamation of Communism from the steps of St. Paul's\r\nCathedral, after the passing of a simply worded bill,--a close and not\r\nunnaturally an exciting division carrying the third reading. I remember\r\nquite distinctly evolving that vision. We were then fully fifteen and we\r\nwere perfectly serious about it. We were not fools; it was simply that\r\nas yet we had gathered no experience at all of the limits and powers of\r\nlegislation and conscious collective intention....\r\n\r\nI think this statement does my boyhood justice, and yet I have my\r\ndoubts. It is so hard now to say what one understood and what one did\r\nnot understand. It isn't only that every day changed one's general\r\noutlook, but also that a boy fluctuates between phases of quite adult\r\nunderstanding and phases of tawdrily magnificent puerility. Sometimes\r\nI myself was in those tumbrils that went along Cheapside to the Mansion\r\nHouse, a Sydney Cartonesque figure, a white defeated Mirabean; sometimes\r\nit was I who sat judging and condemning and ruling (sleeping in\r\nmy clothes and feeding very simply) the soul and autocrat of the\r\nProvisional Government, which occupied, of all inconvenient places! the\r\nGeneral Post Office at St. Martin's-le-Grand!...\r\n\r\nI cannot trace the development of my ideas at Cambridge, but I believe\r\nthe mere physical fact of going two hours' journey away from London gave\r\nthat place for the first time an effect of unity in my imagination. I\r\ngot outside London. It became tangible instead of being a frame almost\r\nas universal as sea and sky.\r\n\r\nAt Cambridge my ideas ceased to live in a duologue; in exchange for\r\nBritten, with whom, however, I corresponded lengthily, stylishly and\r\nself-consciously for some years, I had now a set of congenial friends. I\r\ngot talk with some of the younger dons, I learnt to speak in the Union,\r\nand in my little set we were all pretty busily sharpening each other's\r\nwits and correcting each other's interpretations. Cambridge made\r\npolitics personal and actual. At City Merchants' we had had no sense\r\nof effective contact; we boasted, it is true, an under secretary and a\r\ncolonial governor among our old boys, but they were never real to\r\nus; such distinguished sons as returned to visit the old school were\r\nallusive and pleasant in the best Pinky Dinky style, and pretended to\r\nbe in earnest about nothing but our football and cricket, to mourn the\r\nabolition of “water,” and find a shuddering personal interest in the\r\nancient swishing block. At Cambridge I felt for the first time that I\r\ntouched the thing that was going on. Real living statesmen came down to\r\ndebate in the Union, the older dons had been their college intimates,\r\ntheir sons and nephews expounded them to us and made them real to us.\r\nThey invited us to entertain ideas; I found myself for the first time\r\nin my life expected to read and think and discuss, my secret vice had\r\nbecome a virtue.\r\n\r\nThat combination-room world is at last larger and more populous and\r\nvarious than the world of schoolmasters. The Shoesmiths and Naylors who\r\nhad been the aristocracy of City Merchants' fell into their place in my\r\nmind; they became an undistinguished mass on the more athletic side of\r\nPinky Dinkyism, and their hostility to ideas and to the expression\r\nof ideas ceased to limit and trouble me. The brighter men of each\r\ngeneration stay up; these others go down to propagate their tradition,\r\nas the fathers of families, as mediocre professional men, as assistant\r\nmasters in schools. Cambridge which perfects them is by the nature\r\nof things least oppressed by them,--except when it comes to a vote in\r\nConvocation.\r\n\r\nWe were still in those days under the shadow of the great Victorians. I\r\nnever saw Gladstone (as I never set eyes on the old Queen), but he\r\nhad resigned office only a year before I went up to Trinity, and the\r\nCombination Rooms were full of personal gossip about him and Disraeli\r\nand the other big figures of the gladiatorial stage of Parlimentary\r\nhistory, talk that leaked copiously into such sets as mine. The ceiling\r\nof our guest chamber at Trinity was glorious with the arms of Sir\r\nWilliam Harcourt, whose Death Duties had seemed at first like a\r\nsocialist dawn. Mr. Evesham we asked to come to the Union every year,\r\nMasters, Chamberlain and the old Duke of Devonshire; they did not come\r\nindeed, but their polite refusals brought us all, as it were, within\r\npersonal touch of them. One heard of cabinet councils and meetings at\r\ncountry houses. Some of us, pursuing such interests, went so far as to\r\nread political memoirs and the novels of Disraeli and Mrs. Humphry Ward.\r\nFrom gossip, example and the illustrated newspapers one learnt something\r\nof the way in which parties were split, coalitions formed, how permanent\r\nofficials worked and controlled their ministers, how measures were\r\nbrought forward and projects modified.\r\n\r\nAnd while I was getting the great leading figures on the political\r\nstage, who had been presented to me in my schooldays not so much as men\r\nas the pantomimic monsters of political caricature, while I was getting\r\nthem reduced in my imagination to the stature of humanity, and their\r\nmotives to the quality of impulses like my own, I was also acquiring in\r\nmy Tripos work a constantly developing and enriching conception of\r\nthe world of men as a complex of economic, intellectual and moral\r\nprocesses....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\nSocialism is an intellectual Proteus, but to the men of my generation it\r\ncame as the revolt of the workers. Rodbertus we never heard of and\r\nthe Fabian Society we did not understand; Marx and Morris, the Chicago\r\nAnarchists, JUSTICE and Social Democratic Federation (as it was then)\r\npresented socialism to our minds. Hatherleigh was the leading exponent\r\nof the new doctrines in Trinity, and the figure upon his wall of a\r\nhuge-muscled, black-haired toiler swaggering sledgehammer in hand across\r\na revolutionary barricade, seemed the quintessence of what he had to\r\nexpound. Landlord and capitalist had robbed and enslaved the workers,\r\nand were driving them quite automatically to inevitable insurrection.\r\nThey would arise and the capitalist system would flee and vanish like\r\nthe mists before the morning, like the dews before the sunrise, giving\r\nplace in the most simple and obvious manner to an era of Right and\r\nJustice and Virtue and Well Being, and in short a Perfectly Splendid\r\nTime.\r\n\r\nI had already discussed this sort of socialism under the guidance of\r\nBritten, before I went up to Cambridge. It was all mixed up with ideas\r\nabout freedom and natural virtue and a great scorn for kings, titles,\r\nwealth and officials, and it was symbolised by the red ties we wore. Our\r\nsimple verdict on existing arrangements was that they were “all wrong.”\r\n The rich were robbers and knew it, kings and princes were usurpers and\r\nknew it, religious teachers were impostors in league with power,\r\nthe economic system was an elaborate plot on the part of the few to\r\nexpropriate the many. We went about feeling scornful of all the current\r\nforms of life, forms that esteemed themselves solid, that were, we knew,\r\nno more than shapes painted on a curtain that was presently to be torn\r\naside....\r\n\r\nIt was Hatherleigh's poster and his capacity for overstating things, I\r\nthink, that first qualified my simple revolutionary enthusiasm. Perhaps\r\nalso I had met with Fabian publications, but if I did I forget the\r\ncircumstances. And no doubt my innate constructiveness with its\r\npractical corollary of an analytical treatment of the material supplied,\r\nwas bound to push me on beyond this melodramatic interpretation of human\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nI compared that Working Man of the poster with any sort of working man\r\nI knew. I perceived that the latter was not going to change, and indeed\r\ncould not under any stimulus whatever be expected to change, into the\r\nformer. It crept into my mind as slowly and surely as the dawn creeps\r\ninto a room that the former was not, as I had at first rather glibly\r\nassumed, an “ideal,” but a complete misrepresentation of the quality and\r\npossibilities of things.\r\n\r\nI do not know now whether it was during my school-days or at Cambridge\r\nthat I first began not merely to see the world as a great contrast of\r\nrich and poor, but to feel the massive effect of that multitudinous\r\nmajority of people who toil continually, who are for ever anxious about\r\nways and means, who are restricted, ill clothed, ill fed and ill\r\nhoused, who have limited outlooks and continually suffer misadventures,\r\nhardships and distresses through the want of money. My lot had fallen\r\nupon the fringe of the possessing minority; if I did not know the want\r\nof necessities I knew shabbiness, and the world that let me go on to a\r\nuniversity education intimated very plainly that there was not a thing\r\nbeyond the primary needs that my stimulated imagination might demand\r\nthat it would not be an effort for me to secure. A certain aggressive\r\nradicalism against the ruling and propertied classes followed almost\r\nnaturally from my circumstances. It did not at first connect itself at\r\nall with the perception of a planless disorder in human affairs that had\r\nbeen forced upon me by the atmosphere of my upbringing, nor did it link\r\nme in sympathy with any of the profounder realities of poverty. It was\r\na personal independent thing. The dingier people one saw in the back\r\nstreets and lower quarters of Bromstead and Penge, the drift of dirty\r\nchildren, ragged old women, street loafers, grimy workers that made\r\nthe social background of London, the stories one heard of privation and\r\nsweating, only joined up very slowly with the general propositions I was\r\nmaking about life. We could become splendidly eloquent about the social\r\nrevolution and the triumph of the Proletariat after the Class war, and\r\nit was only by a sort of inspiration that it came to me that my bedder,\r\na garrulous old thing with a dusty black bonnet over one eye and an\r\nostentatiously clean apron outside the dark mysteries that clothed her,\r\nor the cheeky little ruffians who yelled papers about the streets, were\r\nreally material to such questions.\r\n\r\nDirectly any of us young socialists of Trinity found ourselves in\r\nimmediate contact with servants or cadgers or gyps or bedders or\r\nplumbers or navvies or cabmen or railway porters we became unconsciously\r\nand unthinkingly aristocrats. Our voices altered, our gestures altered.\r\nWe behaved just as all the other men, rich or poor, swatters or\r\nsportsmen or Pinky Dinkys, behaved, and exactly as we were expected\r\nto behave. On the whole it is a population of poor quality round about\r\nCambridge, rather stunted and spiritless and very difficult to idealise.\r\nThat theoretical Working Man of ours!--if we felt the clash at all we\r\nexplained it, I suppose, by assuming that he came from another part of\r\nthe country; Esmeer, I remember, who lived somewhere in the Fens, was\r\nvery eloquent about the Cornish fishermen, and Hatherleigh, who was\r\na Hampshire man, assured us we ought to know the Scottish miner.\r\nMy private fancy was for the Lancashire operative because of his\r\nco-operative societies, and because what Lancashire thinks to-day\r\nEngland thinks to-morrow.... And also I had never been in Lancashire.\r\n\r\nBy little increments of realisation it was that the profounder verities\r\nof the problem of socialism came to me. It helped me very much that I\r\nhad to go down to the Potteries several times to discuss my future with\r\nmy uncle and guardian; I walked about and saw Bursley Wakes and much of\r\nthe human aspects of organised industrialism at close quarters for the\r\nfirst time. The picture of a splendid Working Man cheated out of his\r\ninnate glorious possibilities, and presently to arise and dash this\r\nscoundrelly and scandalous system of private ownership to fragments,\r\nbegan to give place to a limitless spectacle of inefficiency, to a\r\nconception of millions of people not organised as they should be, not\r\neducated as they should be, not simply prevented from but incapable\r\nof nearly every sort of beauty, mostly kindly and well meaning, mostly\r\nincompetent, mostly obstinate, and easily humbugged and easily diverted.\r\nEven the tragic and inspiring idea of Marx, that the poor were nearing\r\na limit of painful experience, and awakening to a sense of intolerable\r\nwrongs, began to develop into the more appalling conception that the\r\npoor were simply in a witless uncomfortable inconclusive way--“muddling\r\nalong”; that they wanted nothing very definitely nor very urgently, that\r\nmean fears enslaved them and mean satisfactions decoyed them, that they\r\ntook the very gift of life itself with a spiritless lassitude, hoarding\r\nit, being rather anxious not to lose it than to use it in any way\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nThe complete development of that realisation was the work of many\r\nyears. I had only the first intimations at Cambridge. But I did have\r\nintimations. Most acutely do I remember the doubts that followed the\r\nvisit of Chris Robinson. Chris Robinson was heralded by such heroic\r\nanticipations, and he was so entirely what we had not anticipated.\r\n\r\nHatherleigh got him to come, arranged a sort of meeting for him at\r\nRedmayne's rooms in King's, and was very proud and proprietorial. It\r\nfailed to stir Cambridge at all profoundly. Beyond a futile attempt\r\nto screw up Hatherleigh made by some inexpert duffers who used nails\r\ninstead of screws and gimlets, there was no attempt to rag. Next day\r\nChris Robinson went and spoke at Bennett Hall in Newnham College, and\r\nleft Cambridge in the evening amidst the cheers of twenty men or so.\r\nSocialism was at such a low ebb politically in those days that it didn't\r\neven rouse men to opposition.\r\n\r\nAnd there sat Chris under that flamboyant and heroic Worker of the\r\nposter, a little wrinkled grey-bearded apologetic man in ready-made\r\nclothes, with watchful innocent brown eyes and a persistent and\r\ninvincible air of being out of his element. He sat with his stout boots\r\ntucked up under his chair, and clung to a teacup and saucer and\r\nlooked away from us into the fire, and we all sat about on tables and\r\nchair-arms and windowsills and boxes and anywhere except upon chairs\r\nafter the manner of young men. The only other chair whose seat was\r\noccupied was the one containing his knitted woollen comforter and his\r\npicturesque old beach-photographer's hat. We were all shy and didn't\r\nknow how to take hold of him now we had got him, and, which was\r\ndisconcertingly unanticipated, he was manifestly having the same\r\ndifficulty with us. We had expected to be gripped.\r\n\r\n“I'll not be knowing what to say to these Chaps,” he repeated with a\r\nnorth-country quality in his speech.\r\n\r\nWe made reassuring noises.\r\n\r\nThe Ambassador of the Workers stirred his tea earnestly through an\r\nuncomfortable pause.\r\n\r\n“I'd best tell 'em something of how things are in Lancashire, what\r\nwith the new machines and all that,” he speculated at last with red\r\nreflections in his thoughtful eyes.\r\n\r\nWe had an inexcusable dread that perhaps he would make a mess of the\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\nBut when he was no longer in the unaccustomed meshes of refined\r\nconversation, but speaking with an audience before him, he became a\r\ndifferent man. He declared he would explain to us just exactly what\r\nsocialism was, and went on at once to an impassioned contrast of social\r\nconditions. “You young men,” he said “come from homes of luxury; every\r\nneed you feel is supplied--”\r\n\r\nWe sat and stood and sprawled about him, occupying every inch of\r\nRedmayne's floor space except the hearthrug-platform, and we listened\r\nto him and thought him over. He was the voice of wrongs that made us\r\nindignant and eager. We forgot for a time that he had been shy and\r\nseemed not a little incompetent, his provincial accent became a beauty\r\nof his earnest speech, we were carried away by his indignations. We\r\nlooked with shining eyes at one another and at the various dons who had\r\ndropped in and were striving to maintain a front of judicious severity.\r\nWe felt more and more that social injustice must cease, and cease\r\nforthwith. We felt we could not sleep upon it. At the end we clapped and\r\nmurmured our applause and wanted badly to cheer.\r\n\r\nThen like a lancet stuck into a bladder came the heckling. Denson, that\r\nindolent, liberal-minded sceptic, did most of the questioning. He lay\r\ncontorted in a chair, with his ugly head very low, his legs crossed and\r\nhis left boot very high, and he pointed his remarks with a long thin\r\nhand and occasionally adjusted the unstable glasses that hid his watery\r\neyes. “I don't want to carp,” he began. “The present system, I admit,\r\nstands condemned. Every present system always HAS stood condemned in the\r\nminds of intelligent men. But where it seems to me you get thin, is just\r\nwhere everybody has been thin, and that's when you come to the remedy.”\r\n\r\n“Socialism,” said Chris Robinson, as if it answered everything, and\r\nHatherleigh said “Hear! Hear!” very resolutely.\r\n\r\n“I suppose I OUGHT to take that as an answer,” said Denson, getting\r\nhis shoulder-blades well down to the seat of his chair; “but I don't.\r\nI don't, you know. It's rather a shame to cross-examine you after this\r\nfine address of yours”--Chris Robinson on the hearthrug made acquiescent\r\nand inviting noises--“but the real question remains how exactly are you\r\ngoing to end all these wrongs? There are the administrative questions.\r\nIf you abolish the private owner, I admit you abolish a very complex\r\nand clumsy way of getting businesses run, land controlled and things\r\nin general administered, but you don't get rid of the need of\r\nadministration, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Democracy,” said Chris Robinson.\r\n\r\n“Organised somehow,” said Denson. “And it's just the How perplexes me.\r\nI can quite easily imagine a socialist state administered in a sort of\r\nscrambling tumult that would be worse than anything we have got now.\r\n\r\n“Nothing could be worse than things are now,” said Chris Robinson. “I\r\nhave seen little children--”\r\n\r\n“I submit life on an ill-provisioned raft, for example, could easily be\r\nworse--or life in a beleagured town.”\r\n\r\nMurmurs.\r\n\r\nThey wrangled for some time, and it had the effect upon me of coming out\r\nfrom the glow of a good matinee performance into the cold daylight of\r\nlate afternoon. Chris Robinson did not shine in conflict with Denson; he\r\nwas an orator and not a dialectician, and he missed Denson's points and\r\ndisplayed a disposition to plunge into untimely pathos and indignation.\r\nAnd Denson hit me curiously hard with one of his shafts. “Suppose,” he\r\nsaid, “you found yourself prime minister--”\r\n\r\nI looked at Chris Robinson, bright-eyed and his hair a little ruffled\r\nand his whole being rhetorical, and measured him against the huge\r\nmachine of government muddled and mysterious. Oh! but I was perplexed!\r\n\r\nAnd then we took him back to Hatherleigh's rooms and drank beer and\r\nsmoked about him while he nursed his knee with hairy wristed hands that\r\nprotruded from his flannel shirt, and drank lemonade under the cartoon\r\nof that emancipated Worker, and we had a great discursive talk with him.\r\n\r\n“Eh! you should see our big meetings up north?” he said.\r\n\r\nDenson had ruffled him and worried him a good deal, and ever and again\r\nhe came back to that discussion. “It's all very easy for your learned\r\nmen to sit and pick holes,” he said, “while the children suffer and die.\r\nThey don't pick holes up north. They mean business.”\r\n\r\nHe talked, and that was the most interesting part of it all, of his\r\ngoing to work in a factory when he was twelve--“when you Chaps were all\r\nwith your mammies “--and how he had educated himself of nights until he\r\nwould fall asleep at his reading.\r\n\r\n“It's made many of us keen for all our lives,” he remarked, “all that\r\nclemming for education. Why! I longed all through one winter to read a\r\nbit of Darwin. I must know about this Darwin if I die for it, I said.\r\nAnd I could no' get the book.”\r\n\r\nHatherleigh made an enthusiastic noise and drank beer at him with round\r\neyes over the mug.\r\n\r\n“Well, anyhow I wasted no time on Greek and Latin,” said Chris Robinson.\r\n“And one learns to go straight at a thing without splitting straws. One\r\ngets hold of the Elementals.”\r\n\r\n(Well, did they? That was the gist of my perplexity.)\r\n\r\n“One doesn't quibble,” he said, returning to his rankling memory of\r\nDenson, “while men decay and starve.”\r\n\r\n“But suppose,” I said, suddenly dropping into opposition, “the\r\nalternative is to risk a worse disaster--or do something patently\r\nfutile.”\r\n\r\n“I don't follow that,” said Chris Robinson. “We don't propose anything\r\nfutile, so far as I can see.”\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prevailing force in my undergraduate days was not Socialism\r\nbut Kiplingism. Our set was quite exceptional in its socialistic\r\nprofessions. And we were all, you must understand, very distinctly\r\nImperialists also, and professed a vivid sense of the “White Man's\r\nBurden.”\r\n\r\nIt is a little difficult now to get back to the feelings of that\r\nperiod; Kipling has since been so mercilessly and exhaustively mocked,\r\ncriticised and torn to shreds;--never was a man so violently exalted and\r\nthen, himself assisting, so relentlessly called down. But in the middle\r\nnineties this spectacled and moustached little figure with its heavy\r\nchin and its general effect of vehement gesticulation, its wild shouts\r\nof boyish enthusiasm for effective force, its lyric delight in the\r\nsounds and colours, in the very odours of empire, its wonderful\r\ndiscovery of machinery and cotton waste and the under officer and the\r\nengineer, and “shop” as a poetic dialect, became almost a national\r\nsymbol. He got hold of us wonderfully, he filled us with tinkling and\r\nhaunting quotations, he stirred Britten and myself to futile imitations,\r\nhe coloured the very idiom of our conversation. He rose to his climax\r\nwith his “Recessional,” while I was still an undergraduate.\r\n\r\nWhat did he give me exactly?\r\n\r\nHe helped to broaden my geographical sense immensely, and he provided\r\nphrases for just that desire for discipline and devotion and organised\r\neffort the Socialism of our time failed to express, that the current\r\nsocialist movement still fails, I think, to express. The sort of thing\r\nthat follows, for example, tore something out of my inmost nature and\r\ngave it a shape, and I took it back from him shaped and let much of\r\nthe rest of him, the tumult and the bullying, the hysteria and the\r\nimpatience, the incoherence and inconsistency, go uncriticised for the\r\nsake of it:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“Keep ye the Law--be swift in all obedience--Clear the land of evil,\r\ndrive the road and bridge the ford, Make ye sure to each his own That he\r\nreap where he hath sown; By the peace among Our peoples let men know we\r\nserve the Lord!”\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then again, and for all our later criticism, this sticks in my mind,\r\nsticks there now as quintessential wisdom:\r\n\r\n\r\n     “The 'eathen in 'is blindness bows down to wood an' stone;\r\n     'E don't obey no orders unless they is 'is own;\r\n     'E keeps 'is side-arms awful: 'e leaves 'em all about\r\n     An' then comes up the regiment an' pokes the 'eathen out.\r\n          All along o' dirtiness, all along o' mess,\r\n          All along o' doin' things rather-more-or-less,\r\n          All along of abby-nay, kul, an' hazar-ho,\r\n          Mind you keep your rifle an' yourself jus' so!”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is after all a secondary matter that Kipling, not having been born\r\nand brought up in Bromstead and Penge, and the war in South Africa\r\nbeing yet in the womb of time, could quite honestly entertain the now\r\nremarkable delusion that England had her side-arms at that time kept\r\nanything but “awful.” He learnt better, and we all learnt with him in\r\nthe dark years of exasperating and humiliating struggle that followed,\r\nand I do not see that we fellow learners are justified in turning\r\nresentfully upon him for a common ignorance and assumption....\r\n\r\nSouth Africa seems always painted on the back cloth of my Cambridge\r\nmemories. How immense those disasters seemed at the time, disasters\r\nour facile English world has long since contrived in any edifying or\r\nprofitable sense to forget! How we thrilled to the shouting newspaper\r\nsellers as the first false flush of victory gave place to the\r\nrealisation of defeat. Far away there our army showed itself human,\r\nmortal and human in the sight of all the world, the pleasant officers we\r\nhad imagined would change to wonderful heroes at the first crackling of\r\nrifles, remained the pleasant, rather incompetent men they had always\r\nbeen, failing to imagine, failing to plan and co-operate, failing to\r\ngrip. And the common soldiers, too, they were just what our streets and\r\ncountry-side had made them, no sudden magic came out of the war bugles\r\nfor them. Neither splendid nor disgraceful were they,--just ill-trained\r\nand fairly plucky and wonderfully good-tempered men--paying for it. And\r\nhow it lowered our vitality all that first winter to hear of Nicholson's\r\nNek, and then presently close upon one another, to realise the\r\nbloody waste of Magersfontein, the shattering retreat from Stormberg,\r\nColenso--Colenso, that blundering battle, with White, as it seemed, in\r\nLadysmith near the point of surrender! and so through the long unfolding\r\ncatalogue of bleak disillusionments, of aching, unconcealed anxiety lest\r\nworse should follow. To advance upon your enemy singing about his lack\r\nof cleanliness and method went out of fashion altogether! The dirty\r\nretrogressive Boer vanished from our scheme of illusion.\r\n\r\nAll through my middle Cambridge period, the guns boomed and the rifles\r\ncrackled away there on the veldt, and the horsemen rode and the tale of\r\naccidents and blundering went on. Men, mules, horses, stores and money\r\npoured into South Africa, and the convalescent wounded streamed home. I\r\nsee it in my memory as if I had looked at it through a window instead of\r\nthrough the pages of the illustrated papers; I recall as if I had been\r\nthere the wide open spaces, the ragged hillsides, the open order attacks\r\nof helmeted men in khaki, the scarce visible smoke of the guns, the\r\nwrecked trains in great lonely places, the burnt isolated farms, and\r\nat last the blockhouses and the fences of barbed wire uncoiling and\r\nspreading for endless miles across the desert, netting the elusive enemy\r\nuntil at last, though he broke the meshes again and again, we had him in\r\nthe toils. If one's attention strayed in the lecture-room it wandered to\r\nthose battle-fields.\r\n\r\nAnd that imagined panorama of war unfolds to an accompaniment of yelling\r\nnewsboys in the narrow old Cambridge streets, of the flicker of papers\r\nhastily bought and torn open in the twilight, of the doubtful reception\r\nof doubtful victories, and the insensate rejoicings at last that seemed\r\nto some of us more shameful than defeats....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\nA book that stands out among these memories, that stimulated me\r\nimmensely so that I forced it upon my companions, half in the spirit of\r\npropaganda and half to test it by their comments, was Meredith's ONE OF\r\nOUR CONQUERORS. It is one of the books that have made me. In that I got\r\na supplement and corrective of Kipling. It was the first detached and\r\nadverse criticism of the Englishman I had ever encountered. It must have\r\nbeen published already nine or ten years when I read it. The country\r\nhad paid no heed to it, had gone on to the expensive lessons of the War\r\nbecause of the dull aversion our people feel for all such intimations,\r\nand so I could read it as a book justified. The war endorsed its every\r\nword for me, underlined each warning indication of the gigantic dangers\r\nthat gathered against our system across the narrow seas. It discovered\r\nEurope to me, as watching and critical.\r\n\r\nBut while I could respond to all its criticisms of my country's\r\nintellectual indolence, of my country's want of training and discipline\r\nand moral courage, I remember that the idea that on the continent there\r\nwere other peoples going ahead of us, mentally alert while we fumbled,\r\ndisciplined while we slouched, aggressive and preparing to bring our\r\nImperial pride to a reckoning, was extremely novel and distasteful to\r\nme. It set me worrying of nights. It put all my projects for social and\r\npolitical reconstruction upon a new uncomfortable footing. It made them\r\nno longer merely desirable but urgent. Instead of pride and the love\r\nof making one might own to a baser motive. Under Kipling's sway I had a\r\nlittle forgotten the continent of Europe, treated it as a mere envious\r\necho to our own world-wide display. I began now to have a disturbing\r\nsense as it were of busy searchlights over the horizon....\r\n\r\nOne consequence of the patriotic chagrin Meredith produced in me was an\r\nattempt to belittle his merit. “It isn't a good novel, anyhow,” I said.\r\n\r\nThe charge I brought against it was, I remember, a lack of unity. It\r\nprofessed to be a study of the English situation in the early nineties,\r\nbut it was all deflected, I said, and all the interest was confused by\r\nthe story of Victor Radnor's fight with society to vindicate the woman\r\nhe had loved and never married. Now in the retrospect and with a mind\r\nfull of bitter enlightenment, I can do Meredith justice, and admit the\r\nconflict was not only essential but cardinal in his picture, that the\r\nterrible inflexibility of the rich aunts and the still more terrible\r\nclaim of Mrs. Burman Radnor, the “infernal punctilio,” and Dudley\r\nSowerby's limitations, were the central substance of that inalertness\r\nthe book set itself to assail. So many things have been brought together\r\nin my mind that were once remotely separated. A people that will not\r\nvaliantly face and understand and admit love and passion can understand\r\nnothing whatever. But in those days what is now just obvious truth to me\r\nwas altogether outside my range of comprehension....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I seek to recapitulate the interlacing growth of my apprehension of\r\nthe world, as I flounder among the half-remembered developments that\r\nfound me a crude schoolboy and left me a man, there comes out, as if\r\nit stood for all the rest, my first holiday abroad. That did not happen\r\nuntil I was twenty-two. I was a fellow of Trinity, and the Peace of\r\nVereeniging had just been signed.\r\n\r\nI went with a man named Willersley, a man some years senior to myself,\r\nwho had just missed a fellowship and the higher division of the Civil\r\nService, and who had become an enthusiastic member of the London School\r\nBoard, upon which the cumulative vote and the support of the “advanced”\r\n people had placed him. He had, like myself, a small independent income\r\nthat relieved him of any necessity to earn a living, and he had a\r\nkindred craving for social theorising and some form of social service.\r\nHe had sought my acquaintance after reading a paper of mine (begotten\r\nby the visit of Chris Robinson) on the limits of pure democracy. It had\r\nmarched with some thoughts of his own.\r\n\r\nWe went by train to Spiez on the Lake of Thun, then up the Gemmi,\r\nand thence with one or two halts and digressions and a little modest\r\nclimbing we crossed over by the Antrona pass (on which we were\r\nbenighted) into Italy, and by way of Domo D'ossola and the Santa Maria\r\nMaggiore valley to Cannobio, and thence up the lake to Locarno (where,\r\nas I shall tell, we stayed some eventful days) and so up the Val Maggia\r\nand over to Airolo and home.\r\n\r\nAs I write of that long tramp of ours, something of its freshness and\r\nenlargement returns to me. I feel again the faint pleasant excitement of\r\nthe boat train, the trampling procession of people with hand baggage and\r\nladen porters along the platform of the Folkestone pier, the scarcely\r\nperceptible swaying of the moored boat beneath our feet. Then, very\r\nobvious and simple, the little emotion of standing out from the homeland\r\nand seeing the long white Kentish cliffs recede. One walked about the\r\nboat doing one's best not to feel absurdly adventurous, and presently a\r\nmovement of people directed one's attention to a white lighthouse on a\r\ncliff to the east of us, coming up suddenly; and then one turned to scan\r\nthe little different French coast villages, and then, sliding by in a\r\npale sunshine came a long wooden pier with oddly dressed children upon\r\nit, and the clustering town of Boulogne.\r\n\r\nOne took it all with the outward calm that became a young man of nearly\r\nthree and twenty, but one was alive to one's finger-tips with pleasing\r\nlittle stimulations. The custom house examination excited one, the\r\nstrangeness of a babble in a foreign tongue; one found the French of\r\nCity Merchants' and Cambridge a shy and viscous flow, and then one was\r\nstanding in the train as it went slowly through the rail-laid street to\r\nBoulogne Ville, and one looked out at the world in French, porters in\r\nblouses, workmen in enormous purple trousers, police officers in peaked\r\ncaps instead of helmets and romantically cloaked, big carts, all on\r\ntwo wheels instead of four, green shuttered casements instead of\r\nsash windows, and great numbers of neatly dressed women in economical\r\nmourning.\r\n\r\n“Oh! there's a priest!” one said, and was betrayed into suchlike artless\r\ncries.\r\n\r\nIt was a real other world, with different government and different\r\nmethods, and in the night one was roused from uneasy slumbers and\r\nsat blinking and surly, wrapped up in one's couverture and with one's\r\noreiller all awry, to encounter a new social phenomenon, the German\r\nofficial, so different in manner from the British; and when one woke\r\nagain after that one had come to Bale, and out one tumbled to get coffee\r\nin Switzerland....\r\n\r\nI have been over that route dozens of times since, but it still revives\r\na certain lingering youthfulness, a certain sense of cheerful release in\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI remember that I and Willersley became very sociological as we ran on\r\nto Spiez, and made all sorts of generalisations from the steeply sloping\r\nfields on the hillsides, and from the people we saw on platforms and\r\nfrom little differences in the way things were done.\r\n\r\nThe clean prosperity of Bale and Switzerland, the big clean stations,\r\nfilled me with patriotic misgivings, as I thought of the vast dirtiness\r\nof London, the mean dirtiness of Cambridgeshire. It came to me that\r\nperhaps my scheme of international values was all wrong, that quite\r\nstupendous possibilities and challenges for us and our empire might be\r\ndeveloping here--and I recalled Meredith's Skepsey in France with a new\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\nWillersley had dressed himself in a world-worn Norfolk suit of greenish\r\ngrey tweeds that ended unfamiliarly at his rather impending, spectacled,\r\nintellectual visage. I didn't, I remember, like the contrast of him with\r\nthe drilled Swiss and Germans about us. Convict coloured stockings\r\nand vast hobnail boots finished him below, and all his luggage was a\r\nborrowed rucksac that he had tied askew. He did not want to shave in\r\nthe train, but I made him at one of the Swiss stations--I dislike\r\nthese Oxford slovenlinesses--and then confound him! he cut himself and\r\nbled....\r\n\r\nNext morning we were breathing a thin exhilarating air that seemed to\r\nhave washed our very veins to an incredible cleanliness, and\r\neating hard-boiled eggs in a vast clear space of rime-edged rocks,\r\nsnow-mottled, above a blue-gashed glacier. All about us the monstrous\r\nrock surfaces rose towards the shining peaks above, and there were\r\nwinding moraines from which the ice had receded, and then dark\r\nclustering fir trees far below.\r\n\r\nI had an extraordinary feeling of having come out of things, of being\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n“But this is the round world!” I said, with a sense of never having\r\nperceived it before; “this is the round world!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\n\r\nThat holiday was full of big comprehensive effects; the first view of\r\nthe Rhone valley and the distant Valaisian Alps, for example, which we\r\nsaw from the shoulder of the mountain above the Gemmi, and the early\r\nsummer dawn breaking over Italy as we moved from our night's crouching\r\nand munched bread and chocolate and stretched our stiff limbs among the\r\ntumbled and precipitous rocks that hung over Lake Cingolo, and surveyed\r\nthe winding tiring rocky track going down and down to Antronapiano.\r\n\r\nAnd our thoughts were as comprehensive as our impressions. Willersley's\r\nmind abounded in historical matter; he had an inaccurate abundant habit\r\nof topographical reference; he made me see and trace and see again the\r\nRoman Empire sweep up these winding valleys, and the coming of the first\r\ngreat Peace among the warring tribes of men....\r\n\r\nIn the retrospect each of us seems to have been talking about our\r\noutlook almost continually. Each of us, you see, was full of the same\r\nquestion, very near and altogether predominant to us, the question:\r\n“What am I going to do with my life?” He saw it almost as importantly as\r\nI, but from a different angle, because his choice was largely made and\r\nmine still hung in the balance.\r\n\r\n“I feel we might do so many things,” I said, “and everything that calls\r\none, calls one away from something else.”\r\n\r\nWillersley agreed without any modest disavowals.\r\n\r\n“We have got to think out,” he said, “just what we are and what we are\r\nup to. We've got to do that now. And then--it's one of those questions\r\nit is inadvisable to reopen subsequently.”\r\n\r\nHe beamed at me through his glasses. The sententious use of long words\r\nwas a playful habit with him, that and a slight deliberate humour,\r\nhabits occasional Extension Lecturing was doing very much to intensify.\r\n\r\n“You've made your decision?”\r\n\r\nHe nodded with a peculiar forward movement of his head.\r\n\r\n“How would you put it?”\r\n\r\n“Social Service--education. Whatever else matters or doesn't matter, it\r\nseems to me there is one thing we MUST have and increase, and that\r\nis the number of people who can think a little--and have”--he beamed\r\nagain--“an adequate sense of causation.”\r\n\r\n“You're sure it's worth while.”\r\n\r\n“For me--certainly. I don't discuss that any more.”\r\n\r\n“I don't limit myself too narrowly,” he added. “After all, the work is\r\nall one. We who know, we who feel, are building the great modern state,\r\njoining wall to wall and way to way, the new great England rising out\r\nof the decaying old... we are the real statesmen--I like that use of\r\n'statesmen.'...”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said with many doubts. “Yes, of course....”\r\n\r\nWillersley is middle-aged now, with silver in his hair and a deepening\r\nbenevolence in his always amiable face, and he has very fairly kept his\r\nword. He has lived for social service and to do vast masses of\r\nuseful, undistinguished, fertilising work. Think of the days of\r\narid administrative plodding and of contention still more arid and\r\nunrewarded, that he must have spent! His little affectations of gesture\r\nand manner, imitative affectations for the most part, have increased,\r\nand the humorous beam and the humorous intonations have become a thing\r\nhe puts on every morning like an old coat. His devotion is mingled with\r\na considerable whimsicality, and they say he is easily flattered by\r\nsubordinates and easily offended into opposition by colleagues; he has\r\nmade mistakes at times and followed wrong courses, still there he is,\r\na flat contradiction to all the ordinary doctrine of motives, a man who\r\nhas foregone any chances of wealth and profit, foregone any easier paths\r\nto distinction, foregone marriage and parentage, in order to serve the\r\ncommunity. He does it without any fee or reward except his personal\r\nself-satisfaction in doing this work, and he does it without any hope\r\nof future joys and punishments, for he is an implacable Rationalist. No\r\ndoubt he idealises himself a little, and dreams of recognition. No\r\ndoubt he gets his pleasure from a sense of power, from the spending\r\nand husbanding of large sums of public money, and from the inevitable\r\nproprietorship he must feel in the fair, fine, well-ordered schools he\r\nhas done so much to develop. “But for me,” he can say, “there would have\r\nbeen a Job about those diagrams, and that subject or this would have\r\nbeen less ably taught.”...\r\n\r\nThe fact remains that for him the rewards have been adequate, if not to\r\ncontent at any rate to keep him working. Of course he covets the\r\nnotice of the world he has served, as a lover covets the notice of his\r\nmistress. Of course he thinks somewhere, somewhen, he will get credit.\r\nOnly last year I heard some men talking of him, and they were noting,\r\nwith little mean smiles, how he had shown himself self-conscious while\r\nthere was talk of some honorary degree-giving or other; it would, I have\r\nno doubt, please him greatly if his work were to flower into a crimson\r\ngown in some Academic parterre. Why shouldn't it? But that is incidental\r\nvanity at the worst; he goes on anyhow. Most men don't.\r\n\r\nBut we had our walk twenty years and more ago now. He was oldish even\r\nthen as a young man, just as he is oldish still in middle age. Long\r\nmay his industrious elderliness flourish for the good of the world! He\r\nlectured a little in conversation then; he lectures more now and listens\r\nless, toilsomely disentangling what you already understand, giving you\r\nin detail the data you know; these are things like callosities that come\r\nfrom a man's work.\r\n\r\nOur long three weeks' talk comes back to me as a memory of ideas and\r\ndeterminations slowly growing, all mixed up with a smell of wood smoke\r\nand pine woods and huge precipices and remote gleams of snow-fields and\r\nthe sound of cascading torrents rushing through deep gorges far below.\r\nIt is mixed, too, with gossips with waitresses and fellow travellers,\r\nwith my first essays in colloquial German and Italian, with disputes\r\nabout the way to take, and other things that I will tell of in another\r\nsection. But the white passion of human service was our dominant theme.\r\nNot simply perhaps nor altogether unselfishly, but quite honestly, and\r\nwith at least a frequent self-forgetfulness, did we want to do fine and\r\nnoble things, to help in their developing, to lessen misery, to broaden\r\nand exalt life. It is very hard--perhaps it is impossible--to present\r\nin a page or two the substance and quality of nearly a month's\r\nconversation, conversation that is casual and discursive in form, that\r\nranges carelessly from triviality to immensity, and yet is constantly\r\nresuming a constructive process, as workmen on a wall loiter and jest\r\nand go and come back, and all the while build.\r\n\r\nWe got it more and more definite that the core of our purpose beneath\r\nall its varied aspects must needs be order and discipline. “Muddle,”\r\n said I, “is the enemy.” That remains my belief to this day. Clearness\r\nand order, light and foresight, these things I know for Good. It was\r\nmuddle had just given us all the still freshly painful disasters and\r\nhumiliations of the war, muddle that gives us the visibly sprawling\r\ndisorder of our cities and industrial country-side, muddle that gives us\r\nthe waste of life, the limitations, wretchedness and unemployment of the\r\npoor. Muddle! I remember myself quoting Kipling--\r\n\r\n\r\n    “All along o' dirtiness, all along o' mess,\r\n     All along o' doin' things rather-more-or-less.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“We build the state,” we said over and over again. “That is what we are\r\nfor--servants of the new reorganisation!”\r\n\r\nWe planned half in earnest and half Utopianising, a League of Social\r\nService.\r\n\r\nWe talked of the splendid world of men that might grow out of such\r\nunpaid and ill-paid work as we were setting our faces to do. We spoke\r\nof the intricate difficulties, the monstrous passive resistances, the\r\nhostilities to such a development as we conceived our work subserved,\r\nand we spoke with that underlying confidence in the invincibility of the\r\ncauses we adopted that is natural to young and scarcely tried men.\r\n\r\nWe talked much of the detailed life of politics so far as it was known\r\nto us, and there Willersley was more experienced and far better informed\r\nthan I; we discussed possible combinations and possible developments,\r\nand the chances of some great constructive movement coming from\r\nthe heart-searchings the Boer war had occasioned. We would sink to\r\ngossip--even at the Suetonius level. Willersley would decline towards\r\nilluminating anecdotes that I capped more or less loosely from my\r\nprivate reading. We were particularly wise, I remember, upon the\r\nmanagement of newspapers, because about that we knew nothing whatever.\r\nWe perceived that great things were to be done through newspapers. We\r\ntalked of swaying opinion and moving great classes to massive action.\r\n\r\nMen are egotistical even in devotion. All our splendid projects were\r\nthickset with the first personal pronoun. We both could write, and all\r\nthat we said in general terms was reflected in the particular in our\r\nminds; it was ourselves we saw, and no others, writing and speaking\r\nthat moving word. We had already produced manuscript and passed the\r\ninitiations of proof reading; I had been a frequent speaker in the\r\nUnion, and Willersley was an active man on the School Board. Our feet\r\nwere already on the lower rungs that led up and up. He was six and\r\ntwenty, and I twenty-two. We intimated our individual careers in terms\r\nof bold expectation. I had prophetic glimpses of walls and hoardings\r\nclamorous with “Vote for Remington,” and Willersley no doubt saw himself\r\nchairman of this committee and that, saying a few slightly ironical\r\nwords after the declaration of the poll, and then sitting friendly\r\nbeside me on the government benches. There was nothing impossible in\r\nsuch dreams. Why not the Board of Education for him? My preference at\r\nthat time wavered between the Local Government Board--I had great ideas\r\nabout town-planning, about revisions of municipal areas and re-organised\r\ninternal transit--and the War Office. I swayed strongly towards the\r\nlatter as the journey progressed. My educational bias came later.\r\n\r\nThe swelling ambitions that have tramped over Alpine passes! How many\r\nof them, like mine, have come almost within sight of realisation before\r\nthey failed?\r\n\r\nThere were times when we posed like young gods (of unassuming exterior),\r\nand times when we were full of the absurdest little solicitudes about\r\nour prospects. There were times when one surveyed the whole world of\r\nmen as if it was a little thing at one's feet, and by way of contrast\r\nI remember once lying in bed--it must have been during this holiday,\r\nthough I cannot for the life of me fix where--and speculating whether\r\nperhaps some day I might not be a K. C. B., Sir Richard Remington, K. C.\r\nB., M. P.\r\n\r\nBut the big style prevailed....\r\n\r\nWe could not tell from minute to minute whether we were planning for\r\na world of solid reality, or telling ourselves fairy tales about this\r\nprospect of life. So much seemed possible, and everything we could think\r\nof so improbable. There were lapses when it seemed to me I could never\r\nbe anything but just the entirely unimportant and undistinguished young\r\nman I was for ever and ever. I couldn't even think of myself as five and\r\nthirty.\r\n\r\nOnce I remember Willersley going over a list of failures, and why\r\nthey had failed--but young men in the twenties do not know much about\r\nfailures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\n\r\nWillersley and I professed ourselves Socialists, but by this time I knew\r\nmy Rodbertus as well as my Marx, and there was much in our socialism\r\nthat would have shocked Chris Robinson as much as anything in life could\r\nhave shocked him. Socialism as a simple democratic cry we had done with\r\nfor ever. We were socialists because Individualism for us meant muddle,\r\nmeant a crowd of separated, undisciplined little people all obstinately\r\nand ignorantly doing things jarringly, each one in his own way.\r\n“Each,” I said quoting words of my father's that rose apt in my memory,\r\n“snarling from his own little bit of property, like a dog tied to a\r\ncart's tail.”\r\n\r\n“Essentially,” said Willersley, “essentially we're for conscription, in\r\npeace and war alike. The man who owns property is a public official and\r\nhas to behave as such. That's the gist of socialism as I understand it.”\r\n\r\n“Or be dismissed from his post,” I said, “and replaced by some better\r\nsort of official. A man's none the less an official because he's\r\nirresponsible. What he does with his property affects people just the\r\nsame. Private! No one is really private but an outlaw....”\r\n\r\nOrder and devotion were the very essence of our socialism, and a\r\nsplendid collective vigour and happiness its end. We projected an ideal\r\nstate, an organised state as confident and powerful as modern science,\r\nas balanced and beautiful as a body, as beneficent as sunshine, the\r\norganised state that should end muddle for ever; it ruled all our ideals\r\nand gave form to all our ambitions.\r\n\r\nEvery man was to be definitely related to that, to have his predominant\r\nduty to that. Such was the England renewed we had in mind, and how to\r\nserve that end, to subdue undisciplined worker and undisciplined wealth\r\nto it, and make the Scientific Commonweal, King, was the continuing\r\nsubstance of our intercourse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery day the wine of the mountains was stronger in our blood, and the\r\nflush of our youth deeper. We would go in the morning sunlight along\r\nsome narrow Alpine mule-path shouting large suggestions for national\r\nreorganisation, and weighing considerations as lightly as though the\r\nworld was wax in our hands. “Great England,” we said in effect, over\r\nand over again, “and we will be among the makers! England renewed! The\r\ncountry has been warned; it has learnt its lesson. The disasters and\r\nanxieties of the war have sunk in. England has become serious.... Oh!\r\nthere are big things before us to do; big enduring things!”\r\n\r\nOne evening we walked up to the loggia of a little pilgrimage church,\r\nI forget its name, that stands out on a conical hill at the head of a\r\nwinding stair above the town of Locarno. Down below the houses clustered\r\namidst a confusion of heat-bitten greenery. I had been sitting silently\r\non the parapet, looking across to the purple mountain masses where\r\nSwitzerland passes into Italy, and the drift of our talk seemed suddenly\r\nto gather to a head.\r\n\r\nI broke into speech, giving form to the thoughts that had been\r\naccumulating. My words have long since passed out of my memory, the\r\nphrases of familiar expression have altered for me, but the substance\r\nremains as clear as ever. I said how we were in our measure emperors\r\nand kings, men undriven, free to do as we pleased with life; we classed\r\namong the happy ones, our bread and common necessities were given us for\r\nnothing, we had abilities,--it wasn't modesty but cowardice to behave\r\nas if we hadn't--and Fortune watched us to see what we might do with\r\nopportunity and the world.\r\n\r\n“There are so many things to do, you see,” began Willersley, in his\r\njudicial lecturer's voice.\r\n\r\n“So many things we may do,” I interrupted, “with all these years before\r\nus.... We're exceptional men. It's our place, our duty, to do things.”\r\n\r\n“Here anyhow,” I said, answering the faint amusement of his face; “I've\r\ngot no modesty. Everything conspires to set me up. Why should I run\r\nabout like all those grubby little beasts down there, seeking nothing\r\nbut mean little vanities and indulgencies--and then take credit for\r\nmodesty? I KNOW I am capable. I KNOW I have imagination. Modesty! I know\r\nif I don't attempt the very biggest things in life I am a damned shirk.\r\nThe very biggest! Somebody has to attempt them. I feel like a loaded gun\r\nthat is only a little perplexed because it has to find out just where to\r\naim itself....”\r\n\r\nThe lake and the frontier villages, a white puff of steam on the distant\r\nrailway to Luino, the busy boats and steamers trailing triangular wakes\r\nof foam, the long vista eastward towards battlemented Bellinzona, the\r\nvast mountain distances, now tinged with sunset light, behind this\r\nnearer landscape, and the southward waters with remote coast towns\r\nshining dimly, waters that merged at last in a luminous golden haze,\r\nmade a broad panoramic spectacle. It was as if one surveyed the\r\nworld,--and it was like the games I used to set out upon my nursery\r\nfloor. I was exalted by it; I felt larger than men. So kings should\r\nfeel.\r\n\r\nThat sense of largeness came to me then, and it has come to me since,\r\nagain and again, a splendid intimation or a splendid vanity. Once, I\r\nremember, when I looked at Genoa from the mountain crest behind the\r\ntown and saw that multitudinous place in all its beauty of width and\r\nabundance and clustering human effort, and once as I was steaming past\r\nthe brown low hills of Staten Island towards the towering vigour and\r\nclamorous vitality of New York City, that mood rose to its quintessence.\r\nAnd once it came to me, as I shall tell, on Dover cliffs. And a hundred\r\ntimes when I have thought of England as our country might be, with no\r\nwretched poor, no wretched rich, a nation armed and ordered, trained and\r\npurposeful amidst its vales and rivers, that emotion of collective ends\r\nand collective purposes has returned to me. I felt as great as humanity.\r\nFor a brief moment I was humanity, looking at the world I had made and\r\nhad still to make....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd mingled with these dreams of power and patriotic service there was\r\nanother series of a different quality and a different colour, like the\r\nantagonistic colour of a shot silk. The white life and the red life,\r\ncontrasted and interchanged, passing swiftly at a turn from one to\r\nanother, and refusing ever to mingle peacefully one with the other. I\r\nwas asking myself openly and distinctly: what are you going to do\r\nfor the world? What are you going to do with yourself? and with an\r\nincreasing strength and persistence Nature in spite of my averted\r\nattention was asking me in penetrating undertones: what are you going\r\nto do about this other fundamental matter, the beauty of girls and women\r\nand your desire for them?\r\n\r\nI have told of my sisterless youth and the narrow circumstances of my\r\nupbringing. It made all women-kind mysterious to me. If it had not been\r\nfor my Staffordshire cousins I do not think I should have known any\r\ngirls at all until I was twenty. Of Staffordshire I will tell a little\r\nlater. But I can remember still how through all those ripening years,\r\nthe thought of women's beauty, their magic presence in the world beside\r\nme and the unknown, untried reactions of their intercourse, grew upon me\r\nand grew, as a strange presence grows in a room when one is occupied by\r\nother things. I busied myself and pretended to be wholly occupied, and\r\nthere the woman stood, full half of life neglected, and it seemed to my\r\naverted mind sometimes that she was there clad and dignified and divine,\r\nand sometimes Aphrodite shining and commanding, and sometimes that Venus\r\nwho stoops and allures.\r\n\r\nThis travel abroad seemed to have released a multitude of things in my\r\nmind; the clear air, the beauty of the sunshine, the very blue of\r\nthe glaciers made me feel my body and quickened all those disregarded\r\ndreams. I saw the sheathed beauty of women's forms all about me, in the\r\ncheerful waitresses at the inns, in the pedestrians one encountered\r\nin the tracks, in the chance fellow travellers at the hotel tables.\r\n“Confound it!” said I, and talked all the more zealously of that greater\r\nEngland that was calling us.\r\n\r\nI remember that we passed two Germans, an old man and a tall fair girl,\r\nfather and daughter, who were walking down from Saas. She came swinging\r\nand shining towards us, easy and strong. I worshipped her as she\r\napproached.\r\n\r\n“Gut Tag!” said Willersley, removing his hat.\r\n\r\n“Morgen!” said the old man, saluting.\r\n\r\nI stared stockishly at the girl, who passed with an indifferent face.\r\n\r\nThat sticks in my mind as a picture remains in a room, it has kept there\r\nbright and fresh as a thing seen yesterday, for twenty years....\r\n\r\nI flirted hesitatingly once or twice with comely serving girls, and was\r\na little ashamed lest Willersley should detect the keen interest I took\r\nin them, and then as we came over the pass from Santa Maria Maggiore to\r\nCannobio, my secret preoccupation took me by surprise and flooded me and\r\nbroke down my pretences.\r\n\r\nThe women in that valley are very beautiful--women vary from valley\r\nto valley in the Alps and are plain and squat here and divinities five\r\nmiles away--and as we came down we passed a group of five or six of them\r\nresting by the wayside. Their burthens were beside them, and one like\r\nCeres held a reaping hook in her brown hand. She watched us approaching\r\nand smiled faintly, her eyes at mine.\r\n\r\nThere was some greeting, and two of them laughed together.\r\n\r\nWe passed.\r\n\r\n“Glorious girls they were,” said Willersley, and suddenly an immense\r\nsense of boredom enveloped me. I saw myself striding on down that\r\nwinding road, talking of politics and parties and bills of parliament\r\nand all sorts of dessicated things. That road seemed to me to wind on\r\nfor ever down to dust and infinite dreariness. I knew it for a way of\r\ndeath. Reality was behind us.\r\n\r\nWillersley set himself to draw a sociological moral. “I'm not so\r\nsure,” he said in a voice of intense discriminations, “after all, that\r\nagricultural work isn't good for women.”\r\n\r\n“Damn agricultural work!” I said, and broke out into a vigorous cursing\r\nof all I held dear. “Fettered things we are!” I cried. “I wonder why I\r\nstand it!”\r\n\r\n“Stand what?”\r\n\r\n“Why don't I go back and make love to those girls and let the world and\r\nyou and everything go hang? Deep breasts and rounded limbs--and we poor\r\nemasculated devils go tramping by with the blood of youth in us!...”\r\n\r\n“I'm not quite sure, Remington,” said Willersley, looking at me with\r\na deliberately quaint expression over his glasses, “that picturesque\r\nscenery is altogether good for your morals.”\r\n\r\nThat fever was still in my blood when we came to Locarno.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\n\r\nAlong the hot and dusty lower road between the Orrido of Traffiume and\r\nCannobio Willersley had developed his first blister. And partly because\r\nof that and partly because there was a bag at the station that gave us\r\nthe refreshment of clean linen and partly because of the lazy lower air\r\ninto which we had come, we decided upon three or four days' sojourn in\r\nthe Empress Hotel.\r\n\r\nWe dined that night at a table-d'hote, and I found myself next to an\r\nEnglishwoman who began a conversation that was resumed presently in the\r\nhotel lounge. She was a woman of perhaps thirty-three or thirty-four,\r\nslenderly built, with a warm reddish skin and very abundant fair\r\ngolden hair, the wife of a petulant-looking heavy-faced man of perhaps\r\nfifty-three, who smoked a cigar and dozed over his coffee and\r\npresently went to bed. “He always goes to bed like that,” she confided\r\nstartlingly. “He sleeps after all his meals. I never knew such a man to\r\nsleep.”\r\n\r\nThen she returned to our talk, whatever it was.\r\n\r\nWe had begun at the dinner table with itineraries and the usual\r\ntopographical talk, and she had envied our pedestrian travel. “My\r\nhusband doesn't walk,” she said. “His heart is weak and he cannot manage\r\nthe hills.”\r\n\r\nThere was something friendly and adventurous in her manner; she conveyed\r\nshe liked me, and when presently Willersley drifted off to write\r\nletters our talk sank at once to easy confidential undertones. I felt\r\nenterprising, and indeed it is easy to be daring with people one has\r\nnever seen before and may never see again. I said I loved beautiful\r\nscenery and all beautiful things, and the pointing note in my voice made\r\nher laugh. She told me I had bold eyes, and so far as I can remember I\r\nsaid she made them bold. “Blue they are,” she remarked, smiling archly.\r\n“I like blue eyes.” Then I think we compared ages, and she said she was\r\nthe Woman of Thirty, “George Moore's Woman of Thirty.”\r\n\r\nI had not read George Moore at the time, but I pretended to understand.\r\n\r\nThat, I think, was our limit that evening. She went to bed, smiling\r\ngood-night quite prettily down the big staircase, and I and Willersley\r\nwent out to smoke in the garden. My head was full of her, and I found it\r\nnecessary to talk about her. So I made her a problem in sociology. “Who\r\nthe deuce are these people?” I said, “and how do they get a living? They\r\nseem to have plenty of money. He strikes me as being--Willersley, what\r\nis a drysalter? I think he's a retired drysalter.”\r\n\r\nWillersley theorised while I thought of the woman and that provocative\r\nquality of dash she had displayed. The next day at lunch she and I met\r\nlike old friends. A huge mass of private thinking during the interval\r\nhad been added to our effect upon one another. We talked for a time of\r\ninsignificant things.\r\n\r\n“What do you do,” she asked rather quickly, “after lunch? Take a\r\nsiesta?”\r\n\r\n“Sometimes,” I said, and hung for a moment eye to eye.\r\n\r\nWe hadn't a doubt of each other, but my heart was beating like a steamer\r\npropeller when it lifts out of the water.\r\n\r\n“Do you get a view from your room?” she asked after a pause.\r\n\r\n“It's on the third floor, Number seventeen, near the staircase. My\r\nfriend's next door.”\r\n\r\nShe began to talk of books. She was interested in Christian Science,\r\nshe said, and spoke of a book. I forget altogether what that book was\r\ncalled, though I remember to this day with the utmost exactness the\r\npurplish magenta of its cover. She said she would lend it to me and\r\nhesitated.\r\n\r\nWillersley wanted to go for an expedition across the lake that\r\nafternoon, but I refused. He made some other proposals that I rejected\r\nabruptly. “I shall write in my room,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Why not write down here?”\r\n\r\n“I shall write in my room,” I snarled like a thwarted animal, and he\r\nlooked at me curiously. “Very well,” he said; “then I'll make some notes\r\nand think about that order of ours out under the magnolias.”\r\n\r\nI hovered about the lounge for a time buying postcards and feverishly\r\nrestless, watching the movements of the other people. Finally I went up\r\nto my room and sat down by the windows, staring out. There came a\r\nlittle tap at the unlocked door and in an instant, like the go of a taut\r\nbowstring, I was up and had it open.\r\n\r\n“Here is that book,” she said, and we hesitated.\r\n\r\n“COME IN!” I whispered, trembling from head to foot.\r\n\r\n“You're just a boy,” she said in a low tone.\r\n\r\nI did not feel a bit like a lover, I felt like a burglar with the\r\nsafe-door nearly opened. “Come in,” I said almost impatiently, for\r\nanyone might be in the passage, and I gripped her wrist and drew her\r\ntowards me.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” she answered with a faint smile on her lips, and\r\nawkward and yielding.\r\n\r\nI shut the door behind her, still holding her with one hand, then turned\r\nupon her--she was laughing nervously--and without a word drew her to me\r\nand kissed her. And I remember that as I kissed her she made a little\r\nnoise almost like the purring miaow with which a cat will greet one and\r\nher face, close to mine, became solemn and tender.\r\n\r\nShe was suddenly a different being from the discontented wife who had\r\ntapped a moment since on my door, a woman transfigured....\r\n\r\nThat evening I came down to dinner a monster of pride, for behold! I\r\nwas a man. I felt myself the most wonderful and unprecedented of\r\nadventurers. It was hard to believe that any one in the world before\r\nhad done as much. My mistress and I met smiling, we carried things off\r\nadmirably, and it seemed to me that Willersley was the dullest old dog\r\nin the world. I wanted to give him advice. I wanted to give him derisive\r\npokes. After dinner and coffee in the lounge I was too excited and\r\nhilarious to go to bed, I made him come with me down to the cafe under\r\nthe arches by the pier, and there drank beer and talked extravagant\r\nnonsense about everything under the sun, in order not to talk about the\r\nhappenings of the afternoon. All the time something shouted within me:\r\n“I am a man! I am a man!”...\r\n\r\n“What shall we do to-morrow?” said he.\r\n\r\n“I'm for loafing,” I said. “Let's row in the morning and spend to-morrow\r\nafternoon just as we did to-day.”\r\n\r\n“They say the church behind the town is worth seeing.”\r\n\r\n“We'll go up about sunset; that's the best time for it. We can start\r\nabout five.”\r\n\r\nWe heard music, and went further along the arcade to discover a place\r\nwhere girls in operatic Swiss peasant costume were singing and dancing\r\non a creaking, protesting little stage. I eyed their generous display\r\nof pink neck and arm with the seasoned eye of a man who has lived in the\r\nworld. Life was perfectly simple and easy, I felt, if one took it the\r\nright way.\r\n\r\nNext day Willersley wanted to go on, but I delayed. Altogether I kept\r\nhim back four days. Then abruptly my mood changed, and we decided\r\nto start early the following morning. I remember, though a little\r\nindistinctly, the feeling of my last talk with that woman whose surname,\r\nodd as it may seem, either I never learnt or I have forgotten. (Her\r\nchristian name was Milly.) She was tired and rather low-spirited, and\r\ndisposed to be sentimental, and for the first time in our intercourse I\r\nfound myself liking her for the sake of her own personality. There was\r\nsomething kindly and generous appearing behind the veil of naive and\r\nuncontrolled sensuality she had worn. There was a curious quality of\r\nmotherliness in her attitude to me that something in my nature answered\r\nand approved. She didn't pretend to keep it up that she had yielded to\r\nmy initiative. “I've done you no harm,” she said a little doubtfully, an\r\nodd note for a man's victim! And, “we've had a good time. You have liked\r\nme, haven't you?”\r\n\r\nShe interested me in her lonely dissatisfied life; she was childless and\r\nhad no hope of children, and her husband was the only son of a rich\r\nmeat salesman, very mean, a mighty smoker--“he reeks of it,” she said,\r\n“always”--and interested in nothing but golf, billiards (which he played\r\nvery badly), pigeon shooting, convivial Free Masonry and Stock Exchange\r\npunting. Mostly they drifted about the Riviera. Her mother had contrived\r\nher marriage when she was eighteen. They were the first samples I ever\r\nencountered of the great multitude of functionless property owners which\r\nencumbers modern civilisation--but at the time I didn't think much of\r\nthat aspect of them....\r\n\r\nI tell all this business as it happened without comment, because I\r\nhave no comment to make. It was all strange to me, strange rather than\r\nwonderful, and, it may be, some dream of beauty died for ever in those\r\nfurtive meetings; it happened to me, and I could scarcely have been\r\nmore irresponsible in the matter or controlled events less if I had\r\nbeen suddenly pushed over a cliff into water. I swam, of course--finding\r\nmyself in it. Things tested me, and I reacted, as I have told. The bloom\r\nof my innocence, if ever there had been such a thing, was gone. And here\r\nis the remarkable thing about it; at the time and for some days I was\r\nover-weeningly proud; I have never been so proud before or since; I felt\r\nI had been promoted to virility; I was unable to conceal my exultation\r\nfrom Willersley. It was a mood of shining shameless ungracious\r\nself-approval. As he and I went along in the cool morning sunshine by\r\nthe rice fields in the throat of the Val Maggia a silence fell between\r\nus.\r\n\r\n“You know?” I said abruptly,--“about that woman?”\r\n\r\nWillersley did not answer for a moment. He looked at me over the corner\r\nof his spectacles.\r\n\r\n“Things went pretty far?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh! all the way!” and I had a twinge of fatuous pride in my\r\nunpremeditated achievement.\r\n\r\n“She came to your room?”\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n“I heard her. I heard her whispering.... The whispering and rustling and\r\nso on. I was in my room yesterday.... Any one might have heard you.”\r\n\r\nI went on with my head in the air.\r\n\r\n“You might have been caught, and that would have meant endless trouble.\r\nYou might have incurred all sorts of consequences. What did you know\r\nabout her?... We have wasted four days in that hot close place. When we\r\nfound that League of Social Service we were talking about,” he said\r\nwith a determined eye upon me, “chastity will be first among the virtues\r\nprescribed.”\r\n\r\n“I shall form a rival league,” I said a little damped. “I'm hanged if I\r\ngive up a single desire in me until I know why.”\r\n\r\nHe lifted his chin and stared before him through his glasses at nothing.\r\n“There are some things,” he said, “that a man who means to work--to do\r\ngreat public services--MUST turn his back upon. I'm not discussing the\r\nrights or wrongs of this sort of thing. It happens to be the conditions\r\nwe work under. It will probably always be so. If you want to experiment\r\nin that way, if you want even to discuss it,--out you go from political\r\nlife. You must know that's so.... You're a strange man, Remington, with\r\na kind of kink in you. You've a sort of force. You might happen to do\r\nimmense things.... Only--”\r\n\r\nHe stopped. He had said all that he had forced himself to say.\r\n\r\n“I mean to take myself as I am,” I said. “I'm going to get experience\r\nfor humanity out of all my talents--and bury nothing.”\r\n\r\nWillersley twisted his face to its humorous expression. “I doubt if\r\nsexual proclivities,” he said drily, “come within the scope of the\r\nparable.”\r\n\r\nI let that go for a little while. Then I broke out. “Sex!” said I, “is\r\na fundamental thing in life. We went through all this at Trinity. I'm\r\ngoing to look at it, experience it, think about it--and get it square\r\nwith the rest of life. Career and Politics must take their chances of\r\nthat. It's part of the general English slackness that they won't look\r\nthis in the face. Gods! what a muffled time we're coming out of! Sex\r\nmeans breeding, and breeding is a necessary function in a nation.\r\nThe Romans broke up upon that. The Americans fade out amidst their\r\nsuccesses. Eugenics--”\r\n\r\n“THAT wasn't Eugenics,” said Willersley.\r\n\r\n“It was a woman,” I said after a little interval, feeling oddly that\r\nI had failed altogether to answer him, and yet had a strong dumb case\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE SECOND: MARGARET\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FIRST ~~ MARGARET IN STAFFORDSHIRE\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nI must go back a little way with my story. In the previous book I\r\nhave described the kind of education that happens to a man of my class\r\nnowadays, and it has been convenient to leap a phase in my experience\r\nthat I must now set out at length. I want to tell in this second\r\nhook how I came to marry, and to do that I must give something of the\r\natmosphere in which I first met my wife and some intimations of the\r\nforces that went to her making. I met her in Staffordshire while I was\r\nstaying with that uncle of whom I have already spoken, the uncle who\r\nsold my father's houses and settled my mother in Penge. Margaret was\r\ntwenty then and I was twenty-two.\r\n\r\nIt was just before the walking tour in Switzerland that opened up\r\nso much of the world to me. I saw her once, for an afternoon, and\r\ncircumstances so threw her up in relief that I formed a very vivid\r\nmemory of her. She was in the sharpest contrast with the industrial\r\nworld about her; she impressed me as a dainty blue flower might do,\r\ncome upon suddenly on a clinker heap. She remained in my mind at once a\r\nperplexing interrogation and a symbol....\r\n\r\nBut first I must tell of my Staffordshire cousins and the world that\r\nserved as a foil for her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\nI first went to stay with my cousins when I was an awkward youth of\r\nsixteen, wearing deep mourning for my mother. My uncle wanted to talk\r\nthings over with me, he said, and if he could, to persuade me to go into\r\nbusiness instead of going up to Cambridge.\r\n\r\nI remember that visit on account of all sorts of novel things, but\r\nchiefly, I think, because it was the first time I encountered anything\r\nthat deserves to be spoken of as wealth. For the first time in my life\r\nI had to do with people who seemed to have endless supplies of money,\r\nunlimited good clothes, numerous servants; whose daily life was made\r\nup of things that I had hitherto considered to be treats or exceptional\r\nextravagances. My cousins of eighteen and nineteen took cabs, for\r\ninstance, with the utmost freedom, and travelled first-class in the\r\nlocal trains that run up and down the district of the Five Towns with an\r\nentire unconsciousness of the magnificence, as it seemed to me, of such\r\na proceeding.\r\n\r\nThe family occupied a large villa in Newcastle, with big lawns before\r\nit and behind, a shrubbery with quite a lot of shrubs, a coach house\r\nand stable, and subordinate dwelling-places for the gardener and the\r\ncoachman. Every bedroom contained a gas heater and a canopied brass\r\nbedstead, and had a little bathroom attached equipped with the porcelain\r\nbaths and fittings my uncle manufactured, bright and sanitary and\r\nstamped with his name, and the house was furnished throughout with\r\nchairs and tables in bright shining wood, soft and prevalently\r\nred Turkish carpets, cosy corners, curtained archways, gold-framed\r\nlandscapes, overmantels, a dining-room sideboard like a palace with\r\na large Tantalus, and electric light fittings of a gay and expensive\r\nquality. There was a fine billiard-room on the ground floor with three\r\ncomfortable sofas and a rotating bookcase containing an excellent\r\ncollection of the English and American humorists from THREE MEN IN\r\nA BOAT to the penultimate Mark Twain. There was also a conservatory\r\nopening out of the dining-room, to which the gardener brought potted\r\nflowers in their season....\r\n\r\nMy aunt was a little woman with a scared look and a cap that would\r\nget over one eye, not very like my mother, and nearly eight years her\r\njunior; she was very much concerned with keeping everything nice, and\r\nunmercifully bullied by my two cousins, who took after their father and\r\nfollowed the imaginations of their own hearts. They were tall, dark,\r\nwarmly flushed girls handsome rather than pretty. Gertrude, the eldest\r\nand tallest, had eyes that were almost black; Sibyl was of a stouter\r\nbuild, and her eyes, of which she was shamelessly proud, were dark blue.\r\nSibyl's hair waved, and Gertrude's was severely straight. They treated\r\nme on my first visit with all the contempt of the adolescent girl for a\r\nboy a little younger and infinitely less expert in the business of life\r\nthan herself. They were very busy with the writings of notes and certain\r\nmysterious goings and comings of their own, and left me very much to\r\nmy own devices. Their speech in my presence was full of unfathomable\r\nallusions. They were the sort of girls who will talk over and through an\r\nuninitiated stranger with the pleasantest sense of superiority.\r\n\r\nI met them at breakfast and at lunch and at the half-past six o'clock\r\nhigh tea that formed the third chief meal of the day. I heard them\r\nrattling off the compositions of Chaminade and Moskowski, with great\r\ndecision and effect, and hovered on the edge of tennis foursomes\r\nwhere it was manifest to the dullest intelligence that my presence was\r\nunnecessary. Then I went off to find some readable book in the place,\r\nbut apart from miscellaneous popular novels, some veterinary works, a\r\nnumber of comic books, old bound volumes of THE ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS\r\nand a large, popular illustrated History of England, there was very\r\nlittle to be found. My aunt talked to me in a casual feeble way, chiefly\r\nabout my mother's last illness. The two had seen very little of each\r\nother for many years; she made no secret of it that the ineligible\r\nqualities of my father were the cause of the estrangement. The only\r\nother society in the house during the day was an old and rather decayed\r\nSkye terrier in constant conflict with what were no doubt imaginary\r\nfleas. I took myself off for a series of walks, and acquired a\r\nconsiderable knowledge of the scenery and topography of the Potteries.\r\n\r\nIt puzzled my aunt that I did not go westward, where it was country-side\r\nand often quite pretty, with hedgerows and fields and copses\r\nand flowers. But always I went eastward, where in a long valley\r\nindustrialism smokes and sprawls. That was the stuff to which I turned\r\nby nature, to the human effort, and the accumulation and jar of men's\r\nactivities. And in such a country as that valley social and economic\r\nrelations were simple and manifest. Instead of the limitless confusion\r\nof London's population, in which no man can trace any but the most\r\nslender correlation between rich and poor, in which everyone seems\r\ndisconnected and adrift from everyone, you can see here the works,\r\nthe potbank or the ironworks or what not, and here close at hand the\r\ncongested, meanly-housed workers, and at a little distance a small\r\nmiddle-class quarter, and again remoter, the big house of the employer.\r\nIt was like a very simplified diagram--after the untraceable confusion\r\nof London.\r\n\r\nI prowled alone, curious and interested, through shabby back streets of\r\nmean little homes; I followed canals, sometimes canals of mysteriously\r\nheated waters with ghostly wisps of steam rising against blackened walls\r\nor a distant prospect of dustbin-fed vegetable gardens, I saw the women\r\npouring out from the potbanks, heard the hooters summoning the toilers\r\nto work, lost my way upon slag heaps as big as the hills of the south\r\ncountry, dodged trains at manifestly dangerous level crossings, and\r\nsurveyed across dark intervening spaces, the flaming uproar, the\r\ngnome-like activities of iron foundries. I heard talk of strikes and\r\nrumours of strikes, and learnt from the columns of some obscure labour\r\npaper I bought one day, of the horrors of the lead poisoning that was in\r\nthose days one of the normal risks of certain sorts of pottery workers.\r\nThen back I came, by the ugly groaning and clanging steam train of that\r\nperiod, to my uncle's house and lavish abundance of money and more or\r\nless furtive flirtations and the tinkle of Moskowski and Chaminade.\r\nIt was, I say, diagrammatic. One saw the expropriator and the\r\nexpropriated--as if Marx had arranged the picture. It was as jumbled and\r\nfar more dingy and disastrous than any of the confusions of building and\r\ndevelopment that had surrounded my youth at Bromstead and Penge, but\r\nit had a novel quality of being explicable. I found great virtue in the\r\nword “exploitation.”\r\n\r\nThere stuck in my mind as if it was symbolical of the whole thing the\r\ntwisted figure of a man, whose face had been horribly scalded--I can't\r\ndescribe how, except that one eye was just expressionless white--and\r\nhe ground at an organ bearing a card which told in weak and bitterly\r\nsatirical phrasing that he had been scalded by the hot water from\r\nthe tuyeres of the blast furnace of Lord Pandram's works. He had been\r\nscalded and quite inadequately compensated and dismissed. And Lord\r\nPandram was worth half a million.\r\n\r\nThat upturned sightless white eye of his took possession of my\r\nimagination. I don't think that even then I was swayed by any crude\r\nmelodramatic conception of injustice. I was quite prepared to believe\r\nthe card wasn't a punctiliously accurate statement of fact, and that\r\na case could be made out for Lord Pandram. Still there in the muddy\r\ngutter, painfully and dreadfully, was the man, and he was smashed and\r\nscalded and wretched, and he ground his dismal hurdygurdy with a weary\r\narm, calling upon Heaven and the passer-by for help, for help and some\r\nsort of righting--one could not imagine quite what. There he was as a\r\nfact, as a by-product of the system that heaped my cousins with trinkets\r\nand provided the comic novels and the abundant cigars and spacious\r\nbilliard-room of my uncle's house. I couldn't disconnect him and them.\r\n\r\nMy uncle on his part did nothing to conceal the state of war that\r\nexisted between himself and his workers, and the mingled contempt and\r\nanimosity he felt from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nProsperity had overtaken my uncle. So quite naturally he believed that\r\nevery man who was not as prosperous as he was had only himself to blame.\r\nHe was rich and he had left school and gone into his father's business\r\nat fifteen, and that seemed to him the proper age at which everyone's\r\neducation should terminate. He was very anxious to dissuade me from\r\ngoing up to Cambridge, and we argued intermittently through all my\r\nvisit.\r\n\r\nI had remembered him as a big and buoyant man, striding destructively\r\nabout the nursery floor of my childhood, and saluting my existence by\r\nslaps, loud laughter, and questions about half herrings and half eggs\r\nsubtly framed to puzzle and confuse my mind. I didn't see him for some\r\nyears until my father's death, and then he seemed rather smaller,\r\nthough still a fair size, yellow instead of red and much less radiantly\r\naggressive. This altered effect was due not so much to my own changed\r\nperspectives, I fancy, as to the facts that he was suffering for\r\ncontinuous cigar smoking, and being taken in hand by his adolescent\r\ndaughters who had just returned from school.\r\n\r\nDuring my first visit there was a perpetual series of--the only word is\r\nrows, between them and him. Up to the age of fifteen or thereabouts, he\r\nhad maintained his ascendancy over them by simple old-fashioned physical\r\nchastisement. Then after an interlude of a year it had dawned upon them\r\nthat power had mysteriously departed from him. He had tried stopping\r\ntheir pocket money, but they found their mother financially amenable;\r\nbesides which it was fundamental to my uncle's attitude that he should\r\ngive them money freely. Not to do so would seem like admitting a\r\ndifficulty in making it. So that after he had stopped their allowances\r\nfor the fourth time Sybil and Gertrude were prepared to face beggary\r\nwithout a qualm. It had been his pride to give them the largest\r\nallowance of any girls at the school, not even excepting the\r\ngranddaughter of Fladden the Borax King, and his soul recoiled from this\r\ndiscipline as it had never recoiled from the ruder method of the\r\nearlier phase. Both girls had developed to a high pitch in their mutual\r\nrecriminations a gift for damaging retort, and he found it an altogether\r\ndeadlier thing than the power of the raised voice that had always\r\ncowed my aunt. Whenever he became heated with them, they frowned as if\r\ninvoluntarily, drew in their breath sharply, said: “Daddy, you really\r\nmust not say--” and corrected his pronunciation. Then, at a great\r\nadvantage, they resumed the discussion....\r\n\r\nMy uncle's views about Cambridge, however, were perfectly clear and\r\ndefinite. It was waste of time and money. It was all damned foolery.\r\nDid they make a man a better business man? Not a bit of it. He gave\r\ninstances. It spoilt a man for business by giving him “false ideas.”\r\n Some men said that at college a man formed useful friendships. What use\r\nwere friendships to a business man? He might get to know lords, but, as\r\nmy uncle pointed out, a lord's requirements in his line of faience were\r\nlittle greater than a common man's. If college introduced him to hotel\r\nproprietors there might be something in it. Perhaps it helped a man into\r\nParliament, Parliament still being a confused retrogressive corner\r\nin the world where lawyers and suchlike sheltered themselves from the\r\nonslaughts of common-sense behind a fog of Latin and Greek and twaddle\r\nand tosh; but I wasn't the sort to go into Parliament, unless I meant to\r\nbe a lawyer. Did I mean to be a lawyer? It cost no end of money, and\r\nwas full of uncertainties, and there were no judges nor great solicitors\r\namong my relations. “Young chaps think they get on by themselves,” said\r\nmy uncle. “It isn't so. Not unless they take their coats off. I took\r\nmine off before I was your age by nigh a year.”\r\n\r\nWe were at cross purposes from the outset, because I did not think men\r\nlived to make money; and I was obtuse to the hints he was throwing out\r\nat the possibilities of his own potbank, not willfully obtuse, but just\r\nfailing to penetrate his meaning. Whatever City Merchants had or had\r\nnot done for me, Flack, Topham and old Gates had certainly barred my\r\nmistaking the profitable production and sale of lavatory basins and\r\nbathroom fittings for the highest good. It was only upon reflection that\r\nit dawned upon me that the splendid chance for a young fellow with my\r\nuncle, “me, having no son of my own,” was anything but an illustration\r\nfor comparison with my own chosen career.\r\n\r\nI still remember very distinctly my uncle's talk,--he loved to speak\r\n“reet Staffordshire”--his rather flabby face with the mottled complexion\r\nthat told of crude ill-regulated appetites, his clumsy gestures--he kept\r\nemphasising his points by prodding at me with his finger--the ill-worn,\r\ncostly, grey tweed clothes, the watch chain of plain solid gold, and\r\nsoft felt hat thrust back from his head. He tackled me first in the\r\ngarden after lunch, and then tried to raise me to enthusiasm by taking\r\nme to his potbank and showing me its organisation, from the dusty\r\ngrinding mills in which whitened men worked and coughed, through the\r\nhighly ventilated glazing room in which strangely masked girls looked\r\nashamed of themselves,--“They'll risk death, the fools, to show their\r\nfaces to a man,” said my uncle, quite audibly--to the firing kilns and\r\nthe glazing kilns, and so round the whole place to the railway siding\r\nand the gratifying spectacle of three trucks laden with executed orders.\r\n\r\nThen we went up a creaking outside staircase to his little office, and\r\nhe showed off before me for a while, with one or two subordinates and\r\nthe telephone.\r\n\r\n“None of your Gas,” he said, “all this. It's Real every bit of it. Hard\r\ncash and hard glaze.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said, with memories of a carelessly read pamphlet in my mind,\r\nand without any satirical intention, “I suppose you MUST use lead in\r\nyour glazes?”\r\n\r\nWhereupon I found I had tapped the ruling grievance of my uncle's\r\nlife. He hated leadless glazes more than he hated anything, except\r\nthe benevolent people who had organised the agitation for their use.\r\n“Leadless glazes ain't only fit for buns,” he said. “Let me tell you, my\r\nboy--”\r\n\r\nHe began in a voice of bland persuasiveness that presently warmed to\r\nanger, to explain the whole matter. I hadn't the rights of the matter\r\nat all. Firstly, there was practically no such thing as lead poisoning.\r\nSecondly, not everyone was liable to lead poisoning, and it would\r\nbe quite easy to pick out the susceptible types--as soon as they had\r\nit--and put them to other work. Thirdly, the evil effects of\r\nlead poisoning were much exaggerated. Fourthly, and this was in a\r\nparticularly confidential undertone, many of the people liked to get\r\nlead poisoning, especially the women, because it caused abortion.\r\nI might not believe it, but he knew it for a fact. Fifthly, the\r\nwork-people simply would not learn the gravity of the danger, and would\r\neat with unwashed hands, and incur all sorts of risks, so that as my\r\nuncle put it: “the fools deserve what they get.” Sixthly, he and several\r\nassociated firms had organised a simple and generous insurance scheme\r\nagainst lead-poisoning risks. Seventhly, he never wearied in rational\r\n(as distinguished from excessive, futile and expensive) precautions\r\nagainst the disease. Eighthly, in the ill-equipped shops of his minor\r\ncompetitors lead poisoning was a frequent and virulent evil, and people\r\nhad generalised from these exceptional cases. The small shops, he\r\nhazarded, looking out of the cracked and dirty window at distant\r\nchimneys, might be advantageously closed....\r\n\r\n“But what's the good of talking?” said my uncle, getting off the table\r\non which he had been sitting. “Seems to me there'll come a time when a\r\nmaster will get fined if he don't run round the works blowing his girls\r\nnoses for them. That's about what it'll come to.”\r\n\r\nHe walked to the black mantelpiece and stood on the threadbare rug, and\r\nurged me not to be misled by the stories of prejudiced and interested\r\nenemies of our national industries.\r\n\r\n“They'll get a strike one of these days, of employers, and then we'll\r\nsee a bit,” he said. “They'll drive Capital abroad and then they'll\r\nwhistle to get it back again.”...\r\n\r\nHe led the way down the shaky wooden steps and cheered up to tell me\r\nof his way of checking his coal consumption. He exchanged a ferocious\r\ngreeting with one or two workpeople, and so we came out of the factory\r\ngates into the ugly narrow streets, paved with a peculiarly hard\r\ndiapered brick of an unpleasing inky-blue colour, and bordered with the\r\nmean and squalid homes of his workers. Doors stood open and showed grimy\r\ninteriors, and dirty ill-clad children played in the kennel.\r\n\r\nWe passed a sickly-looking girl with a sallow face, who dragged her\r\nlimbs and peered at us dimly with painful eyes. She stood back, as\r\npartly blinded people will do, to allow us to pass, although there was\r\nplenty of room for us.\r\n\r\nI glanced back at her.\r\n\r\n“THAT'S ploombism,” said my uncle casually.\r\n\r\n“What?” said I.\r\n\r\n“Ploombism. And the other day I saw a fool of a girl, and what d'you\r\nthink? She'd got a basin that hadn't been fired, a cracked piece of\r\nbiscuit it was, up on the shelf over her head, just all over glaze,\r\nkilling glaze, man, and she was putting up her hand if you please, and\r\neating her dinner out of it. Got her dinner in it!\r\n\r\n“Eating her dinner out of it,” he repeated in loud and bitter tones, and\r\npunched me hard in the ribs.\r\n\r\n“And then they comes to THAT--and grumbles. And the fools up in\r\nWestminster want you to put in fans here and fans there--the Longton\r\nfools have.... And then eating their dinners out of it all the time!”...\r\n\r\nAt high tea that night--my uncle was still holding out against evening\r\ndinner--Sibyl and Gertrude made what was evidently a concerted demand\r\nfor a motor-car.\r\n\r\n“You've got your mother's brougham,” he said, “that's good enough for\r\nyou.” But he seemed shaken by the fact that some Burslem rival was\r\nlaunching out with the new invention. “He spoils his girls,” he\r\nremarked. “He's a fool,” and became thoughtful.\r\n\r\nAfterwards he asked me to come to him into his study; it was a room with\r\na writing-desk and full of pieces of earthenware and suchlike litter,\r\nand we had our great row about Cambridge.\r\n\r\n“Have you thought things over, Dick?” he said.\r\n\r\n“I think I'll go to Trinity, Uncle,” I said firmly. “I want to go to\r\nTrinity. It is a great college.”\r\n\r\nHe was manifestly chagrined. “You're a fool,” he said.\r\n\r\nI made no answer.\r\n\r\n“You're a damned fool,” he said. “But I suppose you've got to do it. You\r\ncould have come here--That don't matter, though, now... You'll have your\r\ntime and spend your money, and be a poor half-starved clergyman, mucking\r\nabout with the women all the day and afraid to have one of your own\r\never, or you'll be a schoolmaster or some such fool for the rest of your\r\nlife. Or some newspaper chap. That's what you'll get from Cambridge. I'm\r\nhalf a mind not to let you. Eh? More than half a mind....”\r\n\r\n“You've got to do the thing you can,” he said, after a pause, “and\r\nlikely it's what you're fitted for.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\nI paid several short visits to Staffordshire during my Cambridge days,\r\nand always these relations of mine produced the same effect of hardness.\r\nMy uncle's thoughts had neither atmosphere nor mystery. He lived in\r\na different universe from the dreams of scientific construction that\r\nfilled my mind. He could as easily have understood Chinese poetry. His\r\nmotives were made up of intense rivalries with other men of his class\r\nand kind, a few vindictive hates springing from real and fancied\r\nslights, a habit of acquisition that had become a second nature, a keen\r\nlove both of efficiency and display in his own affairs. He seemed to\r\nme to have no sense of the state, no sense and much less any love of\r\nbeauty, no charity and no sort of religious feeling whatever. He had\r\nstrong bodily appetites, he ate and drank freely, smoked a great deal,\r\nand occasionally was carried off by his passions for a “bit of a spree”\r\n to Birmingham or Liverpool or Manchester. The indulgences of these\r\noccasions were usually followed by a period of reaction, when he was\r\nurgent for the suppression of nudity in the local Art Gallery and a\r\nharsh and forcible elevation of the superficial morals of the valley.\r\nAnd he spoke of the ladies who ministered to the delights of his\r\njolly-dog period, when he spoke of them at all, by the unprintable\r\nfeminine equivalent. My aunt he treated with a kindly contempt and\r\nconsiderable financial generosity, but his daughters tore his heart; he\r\nwas so proud of them, so glad to find them money to spend, so resolved\r\nto own them, so instinctively jealous of every man who came near them.\r\n\r\nMy uncle has been the clue to a great number of men for me. He was an\r\nilluminating extreme. I have learnt what not to expect from them through\r\nhim, and to comprehend resentments and dangerous sudden antagonisms I\r\nshould have found incomprehensible in their more complex forms, if I had\r\nnot first seen them in him in their feral state.\r\n\r\nWith his soft felt hat at the back of his head, his rather heavy, rather\r\nmottled face, his rationally thick boots and slouching tweed-clad form,\r\na little round-shouldered and very obstinate looking, he strolls through\r\nall my speculations sucking his teeth audibly, and occasionally throwing\r\nout a shrewd aphorism, the intractable unavoidable ore of the new\r\ncivilisation.\r\n\r\nEssentially he was simple. Generally speaking, he hated and despised in\r\nequal measure whatever seemed to suggest that he personally was not\r\nthe most perfect human being conceivable. He hated all education after\r\nfifteen because he had had no education after fifteen, he hated all\r\npeople who did not have high tea until he himself under duress gave up\r\nhigh tea, he hated every game except football, which he had played and\r\ncould judge, he hated all people who spoke foreign languages because he\r\nknew no language but Staffordshire, he hated all foreigners because he\r\nwas English, and all foreign ways because they were not his ways. Also\r\nhe hated particularly, and in this order, Londoner's, Yorkshiremen,\r\nScotch, Welch and Irish, because they were not “reet Staffordshire,” and\r\nhe hated all other Staffordshire men as insufficiently “reet.” He wanted\r\nto have all his own women inviolate, and to fancy he had a call upon\r\nevery other woman in the world. He wanted to have the best cigars and\r\nthe best brandy in the world to consume or give away magnificently, and\r\nevery one else to have inferior ones. (His billiard table was an extra\r\nlarge size, specially made and very inconvenient.) And he hated Trade\r\nUnions because they interfered with his autocratic direction of his\r\nworks, and his workpeople because they were not obedient and untiring\r\nmechanisms to do his bidding. He was, in fact, a very naive, vigorous\r\nhuman being. He was about as much civilised, about as much tamed to the\r\nideas of collective action and mutual consideration as a Central African\r\nnegro.\r\n\r\nThere are hordes of such men as he throughout all the modern industrial\r\nworld. You will find the same type with the slightest modifications in\r\nthe Pas de Calais or Rhenish Prussia or New Jersey or North Italy. No\r\ndoubt you would find it in New Japan. These men have raised themselves\r\nup from the general mass of untrained, uncultured, poorish people in a\r\nhard industrious selfish struggle. To drive others they have had first\r\nto drive themselves. They have never yet had occasion nor leisure to\r\nthink of the state or social life as a whole, and as for dreams or\r\nbeauty, it was a condition of survival that they should ignore such\r\ncravings. All the distinctive qualities of my uncle can be thought of as\r\ndictated by his conditions; his success and harshness, the extravagances\r\nthat expressed his pride in making money, the uncongenial luxury that\r\nsprang from rivalry, and his self-reliance, his contempt for broad\r\nviews, his contempt for everything that he could not understand.\r\n\r\nHis daughters were the inevitable children of his life. Queer girls they\r\nwere! Curiously “spirited” as people phrase it, and curiously limited.\r\nDuring my Cambridge days I went down to Staffordshire several times. My\r\nuncle, though he still resented my refusal to go into his business, was\r\nalso in his odd way proud of me. I was his nephew and poor relation, and\r\nyet there I was, a young gentleman learning all sorts of unremunerative\r\nthings in the grandest manner, “Latin and mook,” while the sons of his\r\nneighhours, not nephews merely, but sons, stayed unpolished in their\r\nnative town. Every time I went down I found extensive changes and\r\naltered relations, and before I had settled down to them off I went\r\nagain. I don't think I was one person to them; I was a series of\r\nvisitors. There is a gulf of ages between a gaunt schoolboy of sixteen\r\nin unbecoming mourning and two vividly self-conscious girls of eighteen\r\nand nineteen, but a Cambridge “man” of two and twenty with a first and\r\ngood tennis and a growing social experience, is a fair contemporary for\r\ntwo girls of twenty-three and twenty-four.\r\n\r\nA motor-car appeared, I think in my second visit, a bottle-green\r\naffair that opened behind, had dark purple cushions, and was controlled\r\nmysteriously by a man in shiny black costume and a flat cap. The high\r\ntea had been shifted to seven and rechristened dinner, but my uncle\r\nwould not dress nor consent to have wine; and after one painful\r\nexperiment, I gathered, and a scene, he put his foot down and prohibited\r\nany but high-necked dresses.\r\n\r\n“Daddy's perfectly impossible,” Sybil told me.\r\n\r\nThe foot had descended vehemently! “My own daughters!” he had said,\r\n“dressed up like--“--and had arrested himself and fumbled and decided to\r\nsay--“actresses, and showin' their fat arms for every fool to stare\r\nat!” Nor would he have any people invited to dinner. He didn't, he had\r\nexplained, want strangers poking about in his house when he came home\r\ntired. So such calling as occurred went on during his absence in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nOne of the peculiarities of the life of these ascendant families of\r\nthe industrial class to which wealth has come, is its tremendous\r\ninsulations. There were no customs of intercourse in the Five Towns. All\r\nthe isolated prosperities of the district sprang from economising, hard\r\ndriven homes, in which there was neither time nor means for hospitality.\r\nSocial intercourse centred very largely upon the church or chapel,\r\nand the chapels were better at bringing people together than the\r\nEstablishment to which my cousins belonged. Their chief outlet to the\r\nwider world lay therefore through the acquaintances they had formed at\r\nschool, and through two much less prosperous families of relations who\r\nlived at Longton and Hanley. A number of gossiping friendships with old\r\nschool mates were “kept up,” and my cousins would “spend the afternoon”\r\n or even spend the day with these; such occasions led to other encounters\r\nand interlaced with the furtive correspondences and snatched meetings\r\nthat formed the emotional thread of their lives. When the billiard table\r\nhad been new, my uncle had taken to asking in a few approved friends for\r\nan occasional game, but mostly the billiard-room was for glory and the\r\ngirls. Both of them played very well. They never, so far as I know,\r\ndined out, and when at last after bitter domestic conflicts they began\r\nto go to dances, they went with the quavering connivance of my aunt,\r\nand changed into ball frocks at friends' houses on the way. There was a\r\ntennis club that formed a convenient afternoon rendezvous, and I recall\r\nthat in the period of my earlier visits the young bloods of the district\r\nfound much satisfaction in taking girls for drives in dog-carts and\r\nsuchlike high-wheeled vehicles, a disposition that died in tangled\r\ntandems at the apparition of motor-car's.\r\n\r\nMy aunt and uncle had conceived no plans in life for their daughters at\r\nall. In the undifferentiated industrial community from which they had\r\nsprung, girls got married somehow, and it did not occur to them that\r\nthe concentration of property that had made them wealthy, had cut their\r\nchildren off from the general social sea in which their own awkward\r\nmeeting had occurred, without necessarily opening any other world in\r\nexchange. My uncle was too much occupied with the works and his business\r\naffairs and his private vices to philosophise about his girls; he wanted\r\nthem just to keep girls, preferably about sixteen, and to be a sort\r\nof animated flowers and make home bright and be given things. He was\r\nirritated that they would not remain at this, and still more irritated\r\nthat they failed to suppress altogether their natural interest in young\r\nmen. The tandems would be steered by weird and devious routes to evade\r\nthe bare chance of his bloodshot eye. My aunt seemed to have no ideas\r\nwhatever about what was likely to happen to her children. She had indeed\r\nno ideas about anything; she took her husband and the days as they came.\r\n\r\nI can see now the pathetic difficulty of my cousins' position in life;\r\nthe absence of any guidance or instruction or provision for their\r\ndevelopment. They supplemented the silences of home by the conversation\r\nof schoolfellows and the suggestions of popular fiction. They had to\r\nmake what they could out of life with such hints as these. The church\r\nwas far too modest to offer them any advice. It was obtruded upon my\r\nmind upon my first visit that they were both carrying on correspondences\r\nand having little furtive passings and seeings and meetings with the\r\nmysterious owners of certain initials, S. and L. K., and, if I remember\r\nrightly, “the R. N.” brothers and cousins, I suppose, of their friends.\r\nThe same thing was going on, with a certain intensification, at my next\r\nvisit, excepting only that the initials were different. But when I\r\ncame again their methods were maturer or I was no longer a negligible\r\nquantity, and the notes and the initials were no longer flaunted quite\r\nso openly in my face.\r\n\r\nMy cousins had worked it out from the indications of their universe that\r\nthe end of life is to have a “good time.” They used the phrase. That\r\nand the drives in dog-carts were only the first of endless points of\r\nresemblance between them and the commoner sort of American girl. When\r\nsome years ago I paid my first and only visit to America I seemed to\r\nrecover my cousins' atmosphere as soon as I entered the train at Euston.\r\nThere were three girls in my compartment supplied with huge decorated\r\ncases of sweets, and being seen off by a company of friends, noisily\r\narch and eager about the “steamer letters” they would get at Liverpool;\r\nthey were the very soul-sisters of my cousins. The chief elements of a\r\ngood time, as my cousins judged it, as these countless thousands of rich\r\nyoung women judge it, are a petty eventfulness, laughter, and to feel\r\nthat you are looking well and attracting attention. Shopping is one of\r\nits leading joys. You buy things, clothes and trinkets for yourself and\r\npresents for your friends. Presents always seemed to be flying about\r\nin that circle; flowers and boxes of sweets were common currency. My\r\ncousins were always getting and giving, my uncle caressed them with\r\nparcels and cheques. They kissed him and he exuded sovereigns as a\r\nstroked APHIS exudes honey. It was like the new language of the Academy\r\nof Lagado to me, and I never learnt how to express myself in it, for\r\nnature and training make me feel encumbered to receive presents and\r\nembarrassed in giving them. But then, like my father, I hate and\r\ndistrust possessions.\r\n\r\nOf the quality of their private imagination I never learnt anything; I\r\nsuppose it followed the lines of the fiction they read and was romantic\r\nand sentimental. So far as marriage went, the married state seemed at\r\nonce very attractive and dreadfully serious to them, composed in equal\r\nmeasure of becoming important and becoming old. I don't know what they\r\nthought about children. I doubt if they thought about them at all. It\r\nwas very secret if they did.\r\n\r\nAs for the poor and dingy people all about them, my cousins were always\r\nready to take part in a Charitable Bazaar. They were unaware of any\r\neconomic correlation of their own prosperity and that circumambient\r\npoverty, and they knew of Trade Unions simply as disagreeable external\r\nthings that upset my uncle's temper. They knew of nothing wrong in\r\nsocial life at all except that there were “Agitators.” It surprised them\r\na little, I think, that Agitators were not more drastically put down.\r\nBut they had a sort of instinctive dread of social discussion as of\r\nsomething that might breach the happiness of their ignorance....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\nMy cousins did more than illustrate Marx for me; they also undertook a\r\nstage of my emotional education. Their method in that as in everything\r\nelse was extremely simple, but it took my inexperience by surprise.\r\n\r\nIt must have been on my third visit that Sybil took me in hand. Hitherto\r\nI seemed to have seen her only in profile, but now she became almost\r\ncompletely full face, manifestly regarded me with those violet eyes\r\nof hers. She passed me things I needed at breakfast--it was the first\r\nmorning of my visit--before I asked for them.\r\n\r\nWhen young men are looked at by pretty cousins, they become intensely\r\naware of those cousins. It seemed to me that I had always admired\r\nSybil's eyes very greatly, and that there was something in her\r\ntemperament congenial to mine. It was odd I had not noted it on my\r\nprevious visits.\r\n\r\nWe walked round the garden somewhen that morning, and talked about\r\nCambridge. She asked quite a lot of questions about my work and my\r\nambitions. She said she had always felt sure I was clever.\r\n\r\nThe conversation languished a little, and we picked some flowers for the\r\nhouse. Then she asked if I could run. I conceded her various starts and\r\nwe raced up and down the middle garden path. Then, a little breathless,\r\nwe went into the new twenty-five guinea summer-house at the end of the\r\nherbaceous border.\r\n\r\nWe sat side by side, pleasantly hidden from the house, and she became\r\nanxious about her hair, which was slightly and prettily disarranged, and\r\nasked me to help her with the adjustment of a hairpin. I had never in my\r\nlife been so near the soft curly hair and the dainty eyebrow and eyelid\r\nand warm soft cheek of a girl, and I was stirred--\r\n\r\nIt stirs me now to recall it.\r\n\r\nI became a battleground of impulses and inhibitions.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said my cousin, and moved a little away from me.\r\n\r\nShe began to talk about friendship, and lost her thread and forgot the\r\nlittle electric stress between us in a rather meandering analysis of her\r\nprincipal girl friends.\r\n\r\nBut afterwards she resumed her purpose.\r\n\r\nI went to bed that night with one proposition overshadowing everything\r\nelse in my mind, namely, that kissing my cousin Sybil was a difficult,\r\nbut not impossible, achievement. I do not recall any shadow of a doubt\r\nwhether on the whole it was worth doing. The thing had come into my\r\nexistence, disturbing and interrupting its flow exactly as a fever does.\r\nSybil had infected me with herself.\r\n\r\nThe next day matters came to a crisis in the little upstairs\r\nsitting-room which had been assigned me as a study during my visit.\r\nI was working up there, or rather trying to work in spite of the\r\noutrageous capering of some very primitive elements in my brain, when\r\nshe came up to me, under a transparent pretext of looking for a book.\r\n\r\nI turned round and then got up at the sight of her. I quite forget what\r\nour conversation was about, but I know she led me to believe I might\r\nkiss her. Then when I attempted to do so she averted her face.\r\n\r\n“How COULD you?” she said; “I didn't mean that!”\r\n\r\nThat remained the state of our relations for two days. I developed a\r\ngrowing irritation with and resentment against cousin Sybil, combined\r\nwith an intense desire to get that kiss for which I hungered and\r\nthirsted. Cousin Sybil went about in the happy persuasion that I was\r\nmadly in love with her, and her game, so far as she was concerned,\r\nwas played and won. It wasn't until I had fretted for two days that\r\nI realised that I was being used for the commonest form of excitement\r\npossible to a commonplace girl; that dozens perhaps of young men had\r\nplayed the part of Tantalus at cousin Sybil's lips. I walked about my\r\nroom at nights, damning her and calling her by terms which on the whole\r\nshe rather deserved, while Sybil went to sleep pitying “poor old Dick!”\r\n\r\n“Damn it!” I said, “I WILL be equal with you.”\r\n\r\nBut I never did equalise the disadvantage, and perhaps it's as well, for\r\nI fancy that sort of revenge cuts both people too much for a rational\r\nman to seek it....\r\n\r\n“Why are men so silly?” said cousin Sybil next morning, wriggling back\r\nwith down-bent head to release herself from what should have been a\r\ncompelling embrace.\r\n\r\n“Confound it!” I said with a flash of clear vision. “You STARTED this\r\ngame.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!”\r\n\r\nShe stood back against a hedge of roses, a little flushed and excited\r\nand interested, and ready for the delightful defensive if I should renew\r\nmy attack.\r\n\r\n“Beastly hot for scuffling,” I said, white with anger. “I don't know\r\nwhether I'm so keen on kissing you, Sybil, after all. I just thought you\r\nwanted me to.”\r\n\r\nI could have whipped her, and my voice stung more than my words.\r\n\r\nOur eyes met; a real hatred in hers leaping up to meet mine.\r\n\r\n“Let's play tennis,” I said, after a moment's pause.\r\n\r\n“No,” she answered shortly, “I'm going indoors.”\r\n\r\n“Very well.”\r\n\r\nAnd that ended the affair with Sybil.\r\n\r\nI was still in the full glare of this disillusionment when Gertrude\r\nawoke from some preoccupation to an interest in my existence. She\r\ndeveloped a disposition to touch my hand by accident, and let her\r\nfingers rest in contact with it for a moment,--she had pleasant soft\r\nhands;--she began to drift into summer houses with me, to let her arm\r\nrest trustfully against mine, to ask questions about Cambridge. They\r\nwere much the same questions that Sybil had asked. But I controlled\r\nmyself and maintained a profile of intelligent and entirely civil\r\nindifference to her blandishments.\r\n\r\nWhat Gertrude made of it came out one evening in some talk--I forget\r\nabout what--with Sybil.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Dick!” said Gertrude a little impatiently, “Dick's Pi.”\r\n\r\nAnd I never disillusioned her by any subsequent levity from this theory\r\nof my innate and virginal piety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was against this harsh and crude Staffordshire background that\r\nI think I must have seen Margaret for the first time. I say I think\r\nbecause it is quite possible that we had passed each other in the\r\nstreets of Cambridge, no doubt with that affectation of mutual disregard\r\nwhich was once customary between undergraduates and Newnham girls. But\r\nif that was so I had noted nothing of the slender graciousness that\r\nshone out so pleasingly against the bleaker midland surroundings.\r\n\r\nShe was a younger schoolfellow of my cousins', and the step-daughter\r\nof Seddon, a prominent solicitor of Burslem. She was not only not in\r\nmy cousins' generation but not in their set, she was one of a small\r\nhardworking group who kept immaculate note-books, and did as much as is\r\nhumanly possible of that insensate pile of written work that the Girls'\r\nPublic School movement has inflicted upon school-girls. She really\r\nlearnt French and German admirably and thoroughly, she got as far in\r\nmathematics as an unflinching industry can carry any one with no great\r\nnatural aptitude, and she went up to Bennett Hall, Newnham, after the\r\nusual conflict with her family, to work for the History Tripos.\r\n\r\nThere in her third year she made herself thoroughly ill through\r\noverwork, so ill that she had to give up Newnham altogether and go\r\nabroad with her stepmother. She made herself ill, as so many girls do\r\nin those university colleges, through the badness of her home and school\r\ntraining. She thought study must needs be a hard straining of the mind.\r\nShe worried her work, she gave herself no leisure to see it as a whole,\r\nshe felt herself not making headway and she cut her games and exercise\r\nin order to increase her hours of toil, and worked into the night. She\r\ncarried a knack of laborious thoroughness into the blind alleys and\r\ninessentials of her subject. It didn't need the badness of the food for\r\nwhich Bennett Hall is celebrated and the remarkable dietary of nocturnal\r\ncocoa, cakes and soft biscuits with which the girls have supplemented\r\nit, to ensure her collapse. Her mother brought her home, fretting and\r\ndistressed, and then finding her hopelessly unhappy at home, took her\r\nand her half-brother, a rather ailing youngster of ten who died three\r\nyears later, for a journey to Italy.\r\n\r\nItaly did much to assuage Margaret's chagrin. I think all three of them\r\nhad a very good time there. At home Mr. Seddon, her step-father, played\r\nthe part of a well-meaning blight by reason of the moods that arose\r\nfrom nervous dyspepsia. They went to Florence, equipped with various\r\nintroductions and much sound advice from sympathetic Cambridge friends,\r\nand having acquired an ease in Italy there, went on to Siena, Orvieto,\r\nand at last Rome. They returned, if I remember rightly, by Pisa,\r\nGenoa, Milan and Paris. Six months or more they had had abroad, and now\r\nMargaret was back in Burslem, in health again and consciously a very\r\ncivilised person.\r\n\r\nNew ideas were abroad, it was Maytime and a spring of abundant\r\nflowers--daffodils were particularly good that year--and Mrs. Seddon\r\ncelebrated her return by giving an afternoon reception at short notice,\r\nwith the clear intention of letting every one out into the garden if the\r\nweather held.\r\n\r\nThe Seddons had a big old farmhouse modified to modern ideas of comfort\r\non the road out towards Misterton, with an orchard that had been rather\r\npleasantly subdued from use to ornament. It had rich blossoming cherry\r\nand apple trees. Large patches of grass full of nodding yellow trumpets\r\nhad been left amidst the not too precisely mown grass, which was as\r\nit were grass path with an occasional lapse into lawn or glade. And\r\nMargaret, hatless, with the fair hair above her thin, delicately pink\r\nface very simply done, came to meet our rather too consciously dressed\r\nparty,--we had come in the motor four strong, with my aunt in grey silk.\r\nMargaret wore a soft flowing flowered blue dress of diaphanous material,\r\nall unconnected with the fashion and tied with pretty ribbons, like a\r\nslenderer, unbountiful Primavera.\r\n\r\nIt was one of those May days that ape the light and heat of summer, and\r\nI remember disconnectedly quite a number of brightly lit figures and\r\ngroups walking about, and a white gate between orchard and garden and a\r\nlarge lawn with an oak tree and a red Georgian house with a verandah and\r\nopen French windows, through which the tea drinking had come out upon\r\nthe moss-edged flagstones even as Mrs. Seddon had planned.\r\n\r\nThe party was almost entirely feminine except for a little curate with\r\na large head, a good voice and a radiant manner, who was obviously\r\nattracted by Margaret, and two or three young husbands still\r\nsufficiently addicted to their wives to accompany them. One of them\r\nI recall as a quite romantic figure with abundant blond curly hair on\r\nwhich was poised a grey felt hat encircled by a refined black band. He\r\nwore, moreover, a loose rich shot silk tie of red and purple, a long\r\nfrock coat, grey trousers and brown shoes, and presently he removed his\r\nhat and carried it in one hand. There were two tennis-playing youths\r\nbesides myself. There was also one father with three daughters in\r\nanxious control, a father of the old school scarcely half broken\r\nin, reluctant, rebellious and consciously and conscientiously “reet\r\nStaffordshire.” The daughters were all alert to suppress the possible\r\nplungings, the undesirable humorous impulses of this almost feral guest.\r\nThey nipped his very gestures in the bud. The rest of the people were\r\nmainly mothers with daughters--daughters of all ages, and a scattering\r\nof aunts, and there was a tendency to clotting, parties kept together\r\nand regarded parties suspiciously. Mr. Seddon was in hiding, I think,\r\nall the time, though not formally absent.\r\n\r\nMatters centred upon the tea in the long room of the French windows,\r\nwhere four trim maids went to and fro busily between the house and the\r\nclumps of people seated or standing before it; and tennis and croquet\r\nwere intermittently visible and audible beyond a bank of rockwork rich\r\nwith the spikes and cups and bells of high spring.\r\n\r\nMrs. Seddon presided at the tea urn, and Margaret partly assisted and\r\npartly talked to me and my cousin Sibyl--Gertrude had found a disused\r\nand faded initial and was partnering him at tennis in a state of gentle\r\nrevival--while their mother exercised a divided chaperonage from a seat\r\nnear Mrs. Seddon. The little curate, stirring a partially empty cup of\r\ntea, mingled with our party, and preluded, I remember, every observation\r\nhe made by a vigorous resumption of stirring.\r\n\r\nWe talked of Cambridge, and Margaret kept us to it. The curate was a\r\nSelwyn man and had taken a pass degree in theology, but Margaret had\r\ncome to Gaylord's lecturers in Trinity for a term before her breakdown,\r\nand understood these differences. She had the eagerness of an exile\r\nto hear the old familiar names of places and personalities. We capped\r\nfamiliar anecdotes and were enthusiastic about Kings' Chapel and the\r\nBacks, and the curate, addressing himself more particularly to Sibyl,\r\ntold a long confused story illustrative of his disposition to reckless\r\ndevilry (of a pure-minded kindly sort) about upsetting two canoes quite\r\nneedlessly on the way to Grantchester.\r\n\r\nI can still see Margaret as I saw her that afternoon, see her fresh fair\r\nface, with the little obliquity of the upper lip, and her brow always\r\nslightly knitted, and her manner as of one breathlessly shy but\r\ndetermined. She had rather open blue eyes, and she spoke in an even\r\nmusical voice with the gentlest of stresses and the ghost of a lisp.\r\nAnd it was true, she gathered, that Cambridge still existed. “I went\r\nto Grantchester,” she said, “last year, and had tea under the\r\napple-blossom. I didn't think then I should have to come down.” (It was\r\nthat started the curate upon his anecdote.)\r\n\r\n“I've seen a lot of pictures, and learnt a lot about them--at the Pitti\r\nand the Brera,--the Brera is wonderful--wonderful places,--but it isn't\r\nlike real study,” she was saying presently.... “We bought bales of\r\nphotographs,” she said.\r\n\r\nI thought the bales a little out of keeping.\r\n\r\nBut fair-haired and quite simply and yet graciously and fancifully\r\ndressed, talking of art and beautiful things and a beautiful land, and\r\nwith so much manifest regret for learning denied, she seemed a\r\ndifferent kind of being altogether from my smart, hard, high-coloured,\r\nblack-haired and resolutely hatted cousin; she seemed translucent beside\r\nGertrude. Even the little twist and droop of her slender body was a\r\ngrace to me.\r\n\r\nI liked her from the moment I saw her, and set myself to interest and\r\nplease her as well as I knew how.\r\n\r\nWe recalled a case of ragging that had rustled the shrubs of Newnham,\r\nand then Chris Robinson's visit--he had given a talk to Bennett Hall\r\nalso--and our impression of him.\r\n\r\n“He disappointed me, too,” said Margaret.\r\n\r\nI was moved to tell Margaret something of my own views in the matter of\r\nsocial progress, and she listened--oh! with a kind of urged attention,\r\nand her brow a little more knitted, very earnestly. The little curate\r\ndesisted from the appendices and refuse heaps and general debris of his\r\nstory, and made himself look very alert and intelligent.\r\n\r\n“We did a lot of that when I was up in the eighties,” he said. “I'm glad\r\nImperialism hasn't swamped you fellows altogether.”\r\n\r\nGertrude, looking bright and confident, came to join our talk from the\r\nshrubbery; the initial, a little flushed and evidently in a state of\r\nrefreshed relationship, came with her, and a cheerful lady in pink\r\nand more particularly distinguished by a pink bonnet joined our little\r\ngroup. Gertrude had been sipping admiration and was not disposed to play\r\na passive part in the talk.\r\n\r\n“Socialism!” she cried, catching the word. “It's well Pa isn't here. He\r\nhas Fits when people talk of socialism. Fits!”\r\n\r\nThe initial laughed in a general kind of way.\r\n\r\nThe curate said there was socialism AND socialism, and looked at\r\nMargaret to gauge whether he had been too bold in this utterance. But\r\nshe was all, he perceived, for broad-mindness, and he stirred himself\r\n(and incidentally his tea) to still more liberality of expression. He\r\nsaid the state of the poor was appalling, simply appalling; that there\r\nwere times when he wanted to shatter the whole system, “only,” he said,\r\nturning to me appealingly, “What have we got to put in its place?”\r\n\r\n“The thing that exists is always the more evident alternative,” I said.\r\n\r\nThe little curate looked at it for a moment. “Precisely,” he said\r\nexplosively, and turned stirring and with his head a little on one side,\r\nto hear what Margaret was saying.\r\n\r\nMargaret was saying, with a swift blush and an effect of daring, that\r\nshe had no doubt she was a socialist.\r\n\r\n“And wearing a gold chain!” said Gertrude, “And drinking out of\r\neggshell! I like that!”\r\n\r\nI came to Margaret's rescue. “It doesn't follow that because one's a\r\nsocialist one ought to dress in sackcloth and ashes.”\r\n\r\nThe initial coloured deeply, and having secured my attention by prodding\r\nme slightly with the wrist of the hand that held his teacup, cleared his\r\nthroat and suggested that “one ought to be consistent.”\r\n\r\nI perceived we were embarked upon a discussion of the elements. We began\r\nan interesting little wrangle one of those crude discussions of general\r\nideas that are dear to the heart of youth. I and Margaret supported one\r\nanother as socialists, Gertrude and Sybil and the initial maintained\r\nan anti-socialist position, the curate attempted a cross-bench position\r\nwith an air of intending to come down upon us presently with a casting\r\nvote. He reminded us of a number of useful principles too often\r\noverlooked in argument, that in a big question like this there was much\r\nto be said on both sides, that if every one did his or her duty to every\r\none about them there would be no difficulty with social problems at all,\r\nthat over and above all enactments we needed moral changes in people\r\nthemselves. My cousin Gertrude was a difficult controversialist to\r\nmanage, being unconscious of inconsistency in statement and absolutely\r\nimpervious to reply. Her standpoint was essentially materialistic;\r\nshe didn't see why she shouldn't have a good time because other people\r\ndidn't; they would have a good time, she was sure, if she didn't. She\r\nsaid that if we did give up everything we had to other people, they\r\nwouldn't very likely know what to do with it. She asked if we were so\r\nfond of work-people, why we didn't go and live among them, and expressed\r\nthe inflexible persuasion that if we HAD socialism, everything would\r\nbe just the same again in ten years' time. She also threw upon us the\r\nimputation of ingratitude for a beautiful world by saying that so far as\r\nshe was concerned she didn't want to upset everything. She was contented\r\nwith things as they were, thank you.\r\n\r\nThe discussion led in some way that I don't in the least recall now, and\r\npossibly by abrupt transitions, to a croquet foursome in which Margaret\r\ninvolved the curate without involving herself, and then stood beside me\r\non the edge of the lawn while the others played. We watched silently for\r\na moment.\r\n\r\n“I HATE that sort of view,” she said suddenly in a confidential\r\nundertone, with her delicate pink flush returning.\r\n\r\n“It's want of imagination,” I said.\r\n\r\n“To think we are just to enjoy ourselves,” she went on; “just to go on\r\ndressing and playing and having meals and spending money!” She seemed\r\nto be referring not simply to my cousins, but to the whole world of\r\nindustry and property about us. “But what is one to do?” she asked. “I\r\ndo wish I had not had to come down. It's all so pointless here. There\r\nseems to be nothing going forward, no ideas, no dreams. No one here\r\nseems to feel quite what I feel, the sort of need there is for MEANING\r\nin things. I hate things without meaning.”\r\n\r\n“Don't you do--local work?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose I shall. I suppose I must find something. Do you think--if\r\none were to attempt some sort of propaganda?”\r\n\r\n“Could you--?” I began a little doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“I suppose I couldn't,” she answered, after a thoughtful moment. “I\r\nsuppose it would come to nothing. And yet I feel there is so much to\r\nbe done for the world, so much one ought to be doing.... I want to do\r\nsomething for the world.”\r\n\r\nI can see her now as she stood there with her brows nearly frowning, her\r\nblue eyes looking before her, her mouth almost petulant. “One feels that\r\nthere are so many things going on--out of one's reach,” she said.\r\n\r\nI went back in the motor-car with my mind full of her, the quality of\r\ndelicate discontent, the suggestion of exile. Even a kind of weakness in\r\nher was sympathetic. She told tremendously against her background. She\r\nwas, I say, like a protesting blue flower upon a cinder heap. It is\r\ncurious, too, how she connects and mingles with the furious quarrel\r\nI had with my uncle that very evening. That came absurdly. Indirectly\r\nMargaret was responsible. My mind was running on ideas she had revived\r\nand questions she had set clamouring, and quite inadvertently in my\r\nattempt to find solutions I talked so as to outrage his profoundest\r\nfeelings....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat a preposterous shindy that was!\r\n\r\nI sat with him in the smoking-room, propounding what I considered to\r\nbe the most indisputable and non-contentious propositions\r\nconceivable--until, to my infinite amazement, he exploded and called me\r\na “damned young puppy.”\r\n\r\nIt was seismic.\r\n\r\n“Tremendously interesting time,” I said, “just in the beginning of\r\nmaking a civilisation.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” he said, with an averted face, and nodded, leaning forward over\r\nhis cigar.\r\n\r\nI had not the remotest thought of annoying him.\r\n\r\n“Monstrous muddle of things we have got,” I said, “jumbled streets, ugly\r\npopulation, ugly factories--”\r\n\r\n“You'd do a sight better if you had to do with it,” said my uncle,\r\nregarding me askance.\r\n\r\n“Not me. But a world that had a collective plan and knew where it meant\r\nto be going would do a sight better, anyhow. We're all swimming in a\r\nflood of ill-calculated chances--”\r\n\r\n“You'll be making out I organised that business down there--by\r\nchance--next,” said my uncle, his voice thick with challenge.\r\n\r\nI went on as though I was back in Trinity.\r\n\r\n“There's a lot of chance in the making of all great businesses,” I said.\r\n\r\nMy uncle remarked that that showed how much I knew about businesses.\r\nIf chance made businesses, why was it that he always succeeded and grew\r\nwhile those fools Ackroyd and Sons always took second place? He showed\r\na disposition to tell the glorious history of how once Ackroyd's\r\novershadowed him, and how now he could buy up Ackroyd's three times\r\nover. But I wanted to get out what was in my mind.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” I said, “as between man and man and business and business, some\r\nof course get the pull by this quality or that--but it's forces quite\r\noutside the individual case that make the big part of any success\r\nunder modern conditions. YOU never invented pottery, nor any process in\r\npottery that matters a rap in your works; it wasn't YOUR foresight that\r\njoined all England up with railways and made it possible to organise\r\nproduction on an altogether different scale. You really at the utmost\r\ncan't take credit for much more than being the sort of man who happened\r\nto fit what happened to be the requirements of the time, and who\r\nhappened to be in a position to take advantage of them--”\r\n\r\nIt was then my uncle cried out and called me a damned young puppy, and\r\nbecame involved in some unexpected trouble of his own.\r\n\r\nI woke up as it were from my analysis of the situation to discover him\r\nbent over a splendid spittoon, cursing incoherently, retching a little,\r\nand spitting out the end of his cigar which he had bitten off in his\r\nlast attempt at self-control, and withal fully prepared as soon as he\r\nhad cleared for action to give me just all that he considered to be the\r\ncontents of his mind upon the condition of mine.\r\n\r\nWell, why shouldn't I talk my mind to him? He'd never had an outside\r\nview of himself for years, and I resolved to stand up to him. We went\r\nat it hammer and tongs! It became clear that he supposed me to be a\r\nSocialist, a zealous, embittered hater of all ownership--and also an\r\neducated man of the vilest, most pretentiously superior description.\r\nHis principal grievance was that I thought I knew everything; to that he\r\nrecurred again and again....\r\n\r\nWe had been maintaining an armed truce with each other since my resolve\r\nto go up to Cambridge, and now we had out all that had accumulated\r\nbetween us. There had been stupendous accumulations....\r\n\r\nThe particular things we said and did in that bawling encounter matter\r\nnothing at all in this story. I can't now estimate how near we came\r\nto fisticuffs. It ended with my saying, after a pungent reminder of\r\nbenefits conferred and remembered, that I didn't want to stay another\r\nhour in his house. I went upstairs, in a state of puerile fury, to\r\npack and go off to the Railway Hotel, while he, with ironical civility,\r\ntelephoned for a cab.\r\n\r\n“Good riddance!” shouted my uncle, seeing me off into the night.\r\n\r\nOn the face of it our row was preposterous, but the underlying reality\r\nof our quarrel was the essential antagonism, it seemed to me, in all\r\nhuman affairs, the antagonism between ideas and the established method,\r\nthat is to say, between ideas and the rule of thumb. The world I hate\r\nis the rule-of-thumb world, the thing I and my kind of people exist\r\nfor primarily is to battle with that, to annoy it, disarrange it,\r\nreconstruct it. We question everything, disturb anything that cannot\r\ngive a clear justification to our questioning, because we believe\r\ninherently that our sense of disorder implies the possibility of a\r\nbetter order. Of course we are detestable. My uncle was of that other\r\nvaster mass who accept everything for the thing it seems to be, hate\r\nenquiry and analysis as a tramp hates washing, dread and resist change,\r\noppose experiment, despise science. The world is our battleground; and\r\nall history, all literature that matters, all science, deals with this\r\nconflict of the thing that is and the speculative “if” that will destroy\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBut that is why I did not see Margaret Seddon again for five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE SECOND ~~ MARGARET IN LONDON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nI was twenty-seven when I met Margaret again, and the intervening\r\nfive years had been years of vigorous activity for me, if not of very\r\nremarkable growth. When I saw her again, I could count myself a grown\r\nman. I think, indeed, I counted myself more completely grown than I was.\r\nAt any rate, by all ordinary standards, I had “got on” very well, and\r\nmy ideas, if they had not changed very greatly, had become much more\r\ndefinite and my ambitions clearer and bolder.\r\n\r\nI had long since abandoned my fellowship and come to London. I had\r\npublished two books that had been talked about, written several\r\narticles, and established a regular relationship with the WEEKLY REVIEW\r\nand the EVENING GAZETTE. I was a member of the Eighty Club and learning\r\nto adapt the style of the Cambridge Union to larger uses. The London\r\nworld had opened out to me very readily. I had developed a pleasant\r\nvariety of social connections. I had made the acquaintance of Mr.\r\nEvesham, who had been attracted by my NEW RULER, and who talked about\r\nit and me, and so did a very great deal to make a way for me into the\r\ncompany of prominent and amusing people. I dined out quite frequently.\r\nThe glitter and interest of good London dinner parties became a common\r\nexperience. I liked the sort of conversation one got at them extremely,\r\nthe little glow of duologues burning up into more general discussions,\r\nthe closing-in of the men after the going of the women, the sage,\r\nsubstantial masculine gossiping, the later resumption of effective talk\r\nwith some pleasant woman, graciously at her best. I had a wide range\r\nof houses; Cambridge had linked me to one or two correlated sets of\r\nartistic and literary people, and my books and Mr. Evesham and opened\r\nto me the big vague world of “society.” I wasn't aggressive nor\r\nparticularly snobbish nor troublesome, sometimes I talked well, and if I\r\nhad nothing interesting to say I said as little as possible, and I had\r\na youthful gravity of manner that was liked by hostesses. And the other\r\nside of my nature that first flared through the cover of restraints at\r\nLocarno, that too had had opportunity to develop along the line London\r\nrenders practicable. I had had my experiences and secrets and adventures\r\namong that fringe of ill-mated or erratic or discredited women the\r\nLondon world possesses. The thing had long ago ceased to be a matter of\r\nmagic or mystery, and had become a question of appetites and excitement,\r\nand among other things the excitement of not being found out.\r\n\r\nI write rather doubtfully of my growing during this period. Indeed I\r\nfind it hard to judge whether I can say that I grew at all in any real\r\nsense of the word, between three and twenty and twenty-seven. It seems\r\nto me now to have been rather a phase of realisation and clarification.\r\nAll the broad lines of my thought were laid down, I am sure, by the date\r\nof my Locarno adventure, but in those five years I discussed things over\r\nand over again with myself and others, filled out with concrete fact\r\nforms I had at first apprehended sketchily and conversationally,\r\nmeasured my powers against my ideals and the forces in the world about\r\nme. It was evident that many men no better than myself and with no\r\ngreater advantages than mine had raised themselves to influential and\r\neven decisive positions in the worlds of politics and thought. I was\r\ngathering the confidence and knowledge necessary to attack the world in\r\nthe large manner; I found I could write, and that people would let\r\nme write if I chose, as one having authority and not as the scribes.\r\nSocially and politically and intellectually I knew myself for an honest\r\nman, and that quite without any deliberation on my part this showed\r\nand made things easy for me. People trusted my good faith from the\r\nbeginning--for all that I came from nowhere and had no better position\r\nthan any adventurer.\r\n\r\nBut the growth process was arrested, I was nothing bigger at\r\ntwenty-seven than at twenty-two, however much saner and stronger, and\r\nany one looking closely into my mind during that period might well have\r\nimagined growth finished altogether. It is particularly evident to me\r\nnow that I came no nearer to any understanding of women during that\r\ntime. That Locarno affair was infinitely more to me than I had supposed.\r\nIt ended something--nipped something in the bud perhaps--took me at a\r\nstride from a vague, fine, ignorant, closed world of emotion to intrigue\r\nand a perfectly definite and limited sensuality. It ended my youth, and\r\nfor a time it prevented my manhood. I had never yet even peeped at the\r\nsweetest, profoundest thing in the world, the heart and meaning of a\r\ngirl, or dreamt with any quality of reality of a wife or any such thing\r\nas a friend among womanhood. My vague anticipation of such things in\r\nlife had vanished altogether. I turned away from their possibility. It\r\nseemed to me I knew what had to be known about womankind. I wanted to\r\nwork hard, to get on to a position in which I could develop and forward\r\nmy constructive projects. Women, I thought, had nothing to do with that.\r\nIt seemed clear I could not marry for some years; I was attractive to\r\ncertain types of women, I had vanity enough to give me an agreeable\r\nconfidence in love-making, and I went about seeking a convenient\r\nmistress quite deliberately, some one who should serve my purpose and\r\nsay in the end, like that kindly first mistress of mine, “I've done you\r\nno harm,” and so release me. It seemed the only wise way of disposing\r\nof urgencies that might otherwise entangle and wreck the career I was\r\nintent upon.\r\n\r\nI don't apologise for, or defend my mental and moral phases. So it was\r\nI appraised life and prepared to take it, and so it is a thousand\r\nambitious men see it to-day....\r\n\r\nFor the rest these five years were a period of definition. My political\r\nconceptions were perfectly plain and honest. I had one constant desire\r\nruling my thoughts. I meant to leave England and the empire better\r\nordered than I found it, to organise and discipline, to build up a\r\nconstructive and controlling State out of my world's confusions. We\r\nhad, I saw, to suffuse education with public intention, to develop a new\r\nbetter-living generation with a collectivist habit of thought, to link\r\nnow chaotic activities in every human affair, and particularly to catch\r\nthat escaped, world-making, world-ruining, dangerous thing, industrial\r\nand financial enterprise, and bring it back to the service of the\r\ngeneral good. I had then the precise image that still serves me as a\r\nsymbol for all I wish to bring about, the image of an engineer building\r\na lock in a swelling torrent--with water pressure as his only source of\r\npower. My thoughts and acts were habitually turned to that enterprise;\r\nit gave shape and direction to all my life. The problem that most\r\nengaged my mind during those years was the practical and personal\r\nproblem of just where to apply myself to serve this almost innate\r\npurpose. How was I, a child of this confusion, struggling upward through\r\nthe confusion, to take hold of things? Somewhere between politics and\r\nliterature my grip must needs be found, but where? Always I seem to\r\nhave been looking for that in those opening years, and disregarding\r\neverything else to discover it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Baileys, under whose auspices I met Margaret again, were in the\r\nsharpest contrast with the narrow industrialism of the Staffordshire\r\nworld. They were indeed at the other extreme of the scale, two active\r\nself-centred people, excessively devoted to the public service. It was\r\nnatural I should gravitate to them, for they seemed to stand for the\r\nmaturer, more disciplined, better informed expression of all I was then\r\nurgent to attempt to do. The bulk of their friends were politicians or\r\npublic officials, they described themselves as publicists--a vague yet\r\nsufficiently significant term. They lived and worked in a hard little\r\nhouse in Chambers Street, Westminster, and made a centre for quite an\r\nastonishing amount of political and social activity.\r\n\r\nWillersley took me there one evening. The place was almost pretentiously\r\nmatter-of-fact and unassuming. The narrow passage-hall, papered with\r\nsome ancient yellowish paper, grained to imitate wood, was choked with\r\nhats and cloaks and an occasional feminine wrap. Motioned rather than\r\nannounced by a tall Scotch servant woman, the only domestic I ever\r\nremember seeing there, we made our way up a narrow staircase past the\r\nopen door of a small study packed with blue-books, to discover Altiora\r\nBailey receiving before the fireplace in her drawing-room. She was a\r\ntall commanding figure, splendid but a little untidy in black silk and\r\nred beads, with dark eyes that had no depths, with a clear hard voice\r\nthat had an almost visible prominence, aquiline features and straight\r\nblack hair that was apt to get astray, that was now astray like the\r\nhead feathers of an eagle in a gale. She stood with her hands behind her\r\nback, and talked in a high tenor of a projected Town Planning Bill with\r\nBlupp, who was practically in those days the secretary of the local\r\nGovernment Board. A very short broad man with thick ears and fat white\r\nhands writhing intertwined behind him, stood with his back to us, eager\r\nto bark interruptions into Altiora's discourse. A slender girl in pale\r\nblue, manifestly a young political wife, stood with one foot on the\r\nfender listening with an expression of entirely puzzled propitiation.\r\nA tall sandy-bearded bishop with the expression of a man in a trance\r\ncompleted this central group.\r\n\r\nThe room was one of those long apartments once divided by folding doors,\r\nand reaching from back to front, that are common upon the first floors\r\nof London houses. Its walls were hung with two or three indifferent\r\nwater colours, there was scarcely any furniture but a sofa or so and a\r\nchair, and the floor, severely carpeted with matting, was crowded with\r\na curious medley of people, men predominating. Several were in evening\r\ndress, but most had the morning garb of the politician; the women were\r\neither severely rational or radiantly magnificent. Willersley pointed\r\nout to me the wife of the Secretary of State for War, and I recognised\r\nthe Duchess of Clynes, who at that time cultivated intellectuality. I\r\nlooked round, identifying a face here or there, and stepping back trod\r\non some one's toe, and turned to find it belonged to the Right Hon. G.\r\nB. Mottisham, dear to the PUNCH caricaturists. He received my apology\r\nwith that intentional charm that is one of his most delightful traits,\r\nand resumed his discussion. Beside him was Esmeer of Trinity, whom I had\r\nnot seen since my Cambridge days....\r\n\r\nWillersley found an ex-member of the School Board for whom he had\r\naffinities, and left me to exchange experiences and comments upon the\r\ncompany with Esmeer. Esmeer was still a don; but he was nibbling, he\r\nsaid, at certain negotiations with the TIMES that might bring him\r\ndown to London. He wanted to come to London. “We peep at things from\r\nCambridge,” he said.\r\n\r\n“This sort of thing,” I said, “makes London necessary. It's the oddest\r\ngathering.”\r\n\r\n“Every one comes here,” said Esmeer. “Mostly we hate them like\r\npoison--jealousy--and little irritations--Altiora can be a horror at\r\ntimes--but we HAVE to come.”\r\n\r\n“Things are being done?”\r\n\r\n“Oh!--no doubt of it. It's one of the parts of the British\r\nmachinery--that doesn't show.... But nobody else could do it.\r\n\r\n“Two people,” said Esmeer, “who've planned to be a power--in an original\r\nway. And by Jove! they've done it!”\r\n\r\nI did not for some time pick out Oscar Bailey, and then Esmeer\r\nshowed him to me in elaborately confidential talk in a corner with a\r\ndistinguished-looking stranger wearing a ribbon. Oscar had none of the\r\nfine appearance of his wife; he was a short sturdy figure with a rounded\r\nprotruding abdomen and a curious broad, flattened, clean-shaven face\r\nthat seemed nearly all forehead. He was of Anglo-Hungarian extraction,\r\nand I have always fancied something Mongolian in his type. He peered\r\nup with reddish swollen-looking eyes over gilt-edged glasses that were\r\ndivided horizontally into portions of different refractive power, and he\r\ntalking in an ingratiating undertone, with busy thin lips, an eager lisp\r\nand nervous movements of the hand.\r\n\r\nPeople say that thirty years before at Oxford he was almost exactly the\r\nsame eager, clever little man he was when I first met him. He had come\r\nup to Balliol bristling with extraordinary degrees and prizes captured\r\nin provincial and Irish and Scotch universities--and had made a name for\r\nhimself as the most formidable dealer in exact fact the rhetoricians\r\nof the Union had ever had to encounter. From Oxford he had gone on to a\r\nposition in the Higher Division of the Civil Service, I think in the\r\nWar Office, and had speedily made a place for himself as a political\r\njournalist. He was a particularly neat controversialist, and very full\r\nof political and sociological ideas. He had a quite astounding memory\r\nfor facts and a mastery of detailed analysis, and the time afforded\r\nscope for these gifts. The later eighties were full of politico-social\r\ndiscussion, and he became a prominent name upon the contents list of the\r\nNINETEENTH CENTURY, the FORTNIGHTLY and CONTEMPORARY chiefly as a half\r\nsympathetic but frequently very damaging critic of the socialism of that\r\nperiod. He won the immense respect of every one specially interested in\r\nsocial and political questions, he soon achieved the limited distinction\r\nthat is awarded such capacity, and at that I think he would have\r\nremained for the rest of his life if he had not encountered Altiora.\r\n\r\nBut Altiora Macvitie was an altogether exceptional woman, an\r\nextraordinary mixture of qualities, the one woman in the world who could\r\nmake something more out of Bailey than that. She had much of the\r\nvigour and handsomeness of a slender impudent young man, and an\r\nunscrupulousness altogether feminine. She was one of those women who\r\nare waiting in--what is the word?--muliebrity. She had courage and\r\ninitiative and a philosophical way of handling questions, and she could\r\nbe bored by regular work like a man. She was entirely unfitted for her\r\nsex's sphere. She was neither uncertain, coy nor hard to please, and\r\naltogether too stimulating and aggressive for any gentleman's hours of\r\nease. Her cookery would have been about as sketchy as her handwriting,\r\nwhich was generally quite illegible, and she would have made, I feel\r\nsure, a shocking bad nurse. Yet you mustn't imagine she was an inelegant\r\nor unbeautiful woman, and she is inconceivable to me in high collars or\r\nany sort of masculine garment. But her soul was bony, and at the base\r\nof her was a vanity gaunt and greedy! When she wasn't in a state of\r\npersonal untidiness that was partly a protest against the waste of hours\r\nexacted by the toilet and partly a natural disinclination, she had a\r\ngypsy splendour of black and red and silver all her own. And somewhen in\r\nthe early nineties she met and married Bailey.\r\n\r\nI know very little about her early years. She was the only daughter of\r\nSir Deighton Macvitie, who applied the iodoform process to cotton,\r\nand only his subsequent unfortunate attempts to become a Cotton King\r\nprevented her being a very rich woman. As it was she had a tolerable\r\nindependence. She came into prominence as one of the more able of the\r\nlittle shoal of young women who were led into politico-philanthropic\r\nactivities by the influence of the earlier novels of Mrs. Humphry\r\nWard--the Marcella crop. She went “slumming” with distinguished vigour,\r\nwhich was quite usual in those days--and returned from her experiences\r\nas an amateur flower girl with clear and original views about the\r\nproblem--which is and always had been unusual. She had not married, I\r\nsuppose because her standards were high, and men are cowards and with an\r\ninstinctive appetite for muliebrity. She had kept house for her father\r\nby speaking occasionally to the housekeeper, butler and cook her mother\r\nhad left her, and gathering the most interesting dinner parties she\r\ncould, and had married off four orphan nieces in a harsh and successful\r\nmanner. After her father's smash and death she came out as a writer\r\nupon social questions and a scathing critic of the Charity Organisation\r\nSociety, and she was three and thirty and a little at loose ends when\r\nshe met Oscar Bailey, so to speak, in the CONTEMPORARY REVIEW. The\r\nlurking woman in her nature was fascinated by the ease and precision\r\nwith which the little man rolled over all sorts of important and\r\nauthoritative people, she was the first to discover a sort of\r\nimaginative bigness in his still growing mind, the forehead perhaps\r\ncarried him off physically, and she took occasion to meet and subjugate\r\nhim, and, so soon as he had sufficiently recovered from his abject\r\nhumility and a certain panic at her attentions, marry him.\r\n\r\nThis had opened a new phase in the lives of Bailey and herself. The two\r\nsupplemented each other to an extraordinary extent. Their subsequent\r\ncareer was, I think, almost entirely her invention. She was aggressive,\r\nimaginative, and had a great capacity for ideas, while he was almost\r\ndestitute of initiative, and could do nothing with ideas except remember\r\nand discuss them. She was, if not exact, at least indolent, with a\r\nstrong disposition to save energy by sketching--even her handwriting\r\nshowed that--while he was inexhaustibly industrious with a relentless\r\ninvariable calligraphy that grew larger and clearer as the years passed\r\nby. She had a considerable power of charming; she could be just as nice\r\nto people--and incidentally just as nasty--as she wanted to be. He was\r\nalways just the same, a little confidential and SOTTO VOCE, artlessly\r\nrude and egoistic in an undignified way. She had considerable social\r\nexperience, good social connections, and considerable social ambition,\r\nwhile he had none of these things. She saw in a flash her opportunity\r\nto redeem his defects, use his powers, and do large, novel, rather\r\nstartling things. She ran him. Her marriage, which shocked her friends\r\nand relations beyond measure--for a time they would only speak of Bailey\r\nas “that gnome”--was a stroke of genius, and forthwith they proceeded\r\nto make themselves the most formidable and distinguished couple\r\nconceivable. P. B. P., she boasted, was engraved inside their wedding\r\nrings, Pro Bono Publico, and she meant it to be no idle threat. She had\r\ndiscovered very early that the last thing influential people will do is\r\nto work. Everything in their lives tends to make them dependent upon a\r\nsupply of confidently administered detail. Their business is with the\r\nwindow and not the stock behind, and in the end they are dependent upon\r\nthe stock behind for what goes into the window. She linked with that the\r\nfact that Bailey had a mind as orderly as a museum, and an invincible\r\npower over detail. She saw that if two people took the necessary pains\r\nto know the facts of government and administration with precision, to\r\ngather together knowledge that was dispersed and confused, to be able to\r\nsay precisely what had to be done and what avoided in this eventuality\r\nor that, they would necessarily become a centre of reference for all\r\nsorts of legislative proposals and political expedients, and she went\r\nunhesitatingly upon that.\r\n\r\nBailey, under her vigorous direction, threw up his post in the\r\nCivil Service and abandoned sporadic controversies, and they devoted\r\nthemselves to the elaboration and realisation of this centre of public\r\ninformation she had conceived as their role. They set out to study\r\nthe methods and organisation and realities of government in the most\r\nelaborate manner. They did the work as no one had ever hitherto dreamt\r\nof doing it. They planned the research on a thoroughly satisfying scale,\r\nand arranged their lives almost entirely for it. They took that house\r\nin Chambers Street and furnished it with severe economy, they discovered\r\nthat Scotch domestic who is destined to be the guardian and tyrant of\r\ntheir declining years, and they set to work. Their first book, “The\r\nPermanent Official,” fills three plump volumes, and took them and their\r\ntwo secretaries upwards of four years to do. It is an amazingly good\r\nbook, an enduring achievement. In a hundred directions the history and\r\nthe administrative treatment of the public service was clarified for all\r\ntime....\r\n\r\nThey worked regularly every morning from nine to twelve, they lunched\r\nlightly but severely, in the afternoon they “took exercise” or Bailey\r\nattended meetings of the London School Board, on which he served, he\r\nsaid, for the purposes of study--he also became a railway director\r\nfor the same end. In the late afternoon Altiora was at home to various\r\ncallers, and in the evening came dinner or a reception or both.\r\n\r\nHer dinners and gatherings were a very important feature in their\r\nscheme. She got together all sorts of interesting people in or about\r\nthe public service, she mixed the obscurely efficient with the\r\nill-instructed famous and the rudderless rich, got together in one room\r\nmore of the factors in our strange jumble of a public life than had ever\r\nmet easily before. She fed them with a shameless austerity that kept the\r\nconversation brilliant, on a soup, a plain fish, and mutton or boiled\r\nfowl and milk pudding, with nothing to drink but whisky and soda, and\r\nhot and cold water, and milk and lemonade. Everybody was soon very glad\r\nindeed to come to that. She boasted how little her housekeeping cost\r\nher, and sought constantly for fresh economies that would enable her,\r\nshe said, to sustain an additional private secretary. Secretaries were\r\nthe Baileys' one extravagance, they loved to think of searches going\r\non in the British Museum, and letters being cleared up and precis made\r\noverhead, while they sat in the little study and worked together, Bailey\r\nwith a clockwork industry, and Altiora in splendid flashes between\r\nintervals of cigarettes and meditation. “All efficient public careers,”\r\n said Altiora, “consist in the proper direction of secretaries.”\r\n\r\n“If everything goes well I shall have another secretary next year,”\r\n Altiora told me. “I wish I could refuse people dinner napkins. Imagine\r\nwhat it means in washing! I dare most things.... But as it is, they\r\nstand a lot of hardship here.”\r\n\r\n“There's something of the miser in both these people,” said Esmeer, and\r\nthe thing was perfectly true. For, after all, the miser is nothing more\r\nthan a man who either through want of imagination or want of suggestion\r\nmisapplies to a base use a natural power of concentration upon one end.\r\nThe concentration itself is neither good nor evil, but a power that\r\ncan be used in either way. And the Baileys gathered and reinvested\r\nusuriously not money, but knowledge of the utmost value in human\r\naffairs. They produced an effect of having found themselves--completely.\r\nOne envied them at times extraordinarily. I was attracted, I was\r\ndazzled--and at the same time there was something about Bailey's big\r\nwrinkled forehead, his lisping broad mouth, the gestures of his hands\r\nand an uncivil preoccupation I could not endure....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir effect upon me was from the outset very considerable.\r\n\r\nBoth of them found occasion on that first visit of mine to talk to\r\nme about my published writings and particularly about my then just\r\npublished book THE NEW RULER, which had interested them very much. It\r\nfell in indeed so closely with their own way of thinking that I doubt if\r\nthey ever understood how independently I had arrived at my conclusions.\r\nIt was their weakness to claim excessively. That irritation, however,\r\ncame later. We discovered each other immensely; for a time it produced a\r\ntremendous sense of kindred and co-operation.\r\n\r\nAltiora, I remember, maintained that there existed a great army of such\r\nconstructive-minded people as ourselves--as yet undiscovered by one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n“It's like boring a tunnel through a mountain,” said Oscar, “and\r\npresently hearing the tapping of the workers from the other end.”\r\n\r\n“If you didn't know of them beforehand,” I said, “it might be a rather\r\nbadly joined tunnel.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” said Altiora with a high note, “and that's why we all want to\r\nfind out each other....”\r\n\r\nThey didn't talk like that on our first encounter, but they urged me to\r\nlunch with them next day, and then it was we went into things. A woman\r\nFactory Inspector and the Educational Minister for New Banksland and his\r\nwife were also there, but I don't remember they made any contribution\r\nto the conversation. The Baileys saw to that. They kept on at me in an\r\nurgent litigious way.\r\n\r\n“We have read your book,” each began--as though it had been a joint\r\nfunction. “And we consider--”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I protested, “I think--”\r\n\r\n That was a secondary matter.\r\n\r\n“They did not consider,” said Altiora, raising her voice and going right\r\nover me, “that I had allowed sufficiently for the inevitable development\r\nof an official administrative class in the modern state.”\r\n\r\n“Nor of its importance,” echoed Oscar.\r\n\r\nThat, they explained in a sort of chorus, was the cardinal idea of their\r\nlives, what they were up to, what they stood for. “We want to suggest to\r\nyou,” they said--and I found this was a stock opening of theirs--“that\r\nfrom the mere necessities of convenience elected bodies MUST avail\r\nthemselves more and more of the services of expert officials. We have\r\nthat very much in mind. The more complicated and technical affairs\r\nbecome, the less confidence will the elected official have in himself.\r\nWe want to suggest that these expert officials must necessarily develop\r\ninto a new class and a very powerful class in the community. We want to\r\norganise that. It may be THE power of the future. They will necessarily\r\nhave to have very much of a common training. We consider ourselves as\r\namateur unpaid precursors of such a class.”...\r\n\r\nThe vision they displayed for my consideration as the aim of\r\npublic-spirited endeavour, seemed like a harder, narrower, more\r\nspecialised version of the idea of a trained and disciplined state that\r\nWillersley and I had worked out in the Alps. They wanted things more\r\norganised, more correlated with government and a collective purpose,\r\njust as we did, but they saw it not in terms of a growing collective\r\nunderstanding, but in terms of functionaries, legislative change, and\r\nmethods of administration....\r\n\r\nIt wasn't clear at first how we differed. The Baileys were very anxious\r\nto win me to co-operation, and I was quite prepared at first to identify\r\ntheir distinctive expressions with phrases of my own, and so we came\r\nvery readily into an alliance that was to last some years, and break at\r\nlast very painfully. Altiora manifestly liked me, I was soon discussing\r\nwith her the perplexity I found in placing myself efficiently in the\r\nworld, the problem of how to take hold of things that occupied my\r\nthoughts, and she was sketching out careers for my consideration, very\r\nmuch as an architect on his first visit sketches houses, considers\r\nrequirements, and puts before you this example and that of the more or\r\nless similar thing already done....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see how much in common there was between the Baileys and\r\nme, and how natural it was that I should become a constant visitor at\r\ntheir house and an ally of theirs in many enterprises. It is not nearly\r\nso easy to define the profound antagonism of spirit that also held\r\nbetween us. There was a difference in texture, a difference in quality.\r\nHow can I express it? The shapes of our thoughts were the same, but the\r\nsubstance quite different. It was as if they had made in china or cast\r\niron what I had made in transparent living matter. (The comparison is\r\nmanifestly from my point of view.) Certain things never seemed to show\r\nthrough their ideas that were visible, refracted perhaps and distorted,\r\nbut visible always through mine.\r\n\r\nI thought for a time the essential difference lay in our relation to\r\nbeauty. With me beauty is quite primary in life; I like truth, order\r\nand goodness, wholly because they are beautiful or lead straight to\r\nbeautiful consequences. The Baileys either hadn't got that or they\r\ndidn't see it. They seemed at times to prefer things harsh and ugly.\r\nThat puzzled me extremely. The esthetic quality of many of their\r\nproposals, the “manners” of their work, so to speak, were at times as\r\ndreadful as--well, War Office barrack architecture. A caricature by\r\nits exaggerated statements will sometimes serve to point a truth by\r\nantagonising falsity and falsity. I remember talking to a prominent\r\nmuseum official in need of more public funds for the work he had in\r\nhand. I mentioned the possibility of enlisting Bailey's influence.\r\n\r\n“Oh, we don't want Philistines like that infernal Bottle-Imp running\r\nus,” he said hastily, and would hear of no concerted action for the end\r\nhe had in view. “I'd rather not have the extension.\r\n\r\n“You see,” he went on to explain, “Bailey's wanting in the essentials.”\r\n\r\n“What essentials?” said I.\r\n\r\n“Oh! he'd be like a nasty oily efficient little machine for some merely\r\nsubordinate necessity among all my delicate stuff. He'd do all we wanted\r\nno doubt in the way of money and powers--and he'd do it wrong and mess\r\nthe place for ever. Hands all black, you know. He's just a means. Just a\r\nvery aggressive and unmanageable means. This isn't a plumber's job....”\r\n\r\nI stuck to my argument.\r\n\r\n“I don't LIKE him,” said the official conclusively, and it seemed to me\r\nat the time he was just blind prejudice speaking....\r\n\r\nI came nearer the truth of the matter as I came to realise that\r\nour philosophies differed profoundly. That isn't a very curable\r\ndifference,--once people have grown up. Theirs was a philosophy devoid\r\nof FINESSE. Temperamentally the Baileys were specialised, concentrated,\r\naccurate, while I am urged either by some Inner force or some entirely\r\nassimilated influence in my training, always to round off and shadow\r\nmy outlines. I hate them hard. I would sacrifice detail to modelling\r\nalways, and the Baileys, it seemed to me, loved a world as flat and\r\nmetallic as Sidney Cooper's cows. If they had the universe in hand I\r\nknow they would take down all the trees and put up stamped tin green\r\nshades and sunlight accumulators. Altiora thought trees hopelessly\r\nirregular and sea cliffs a great mistake.... I got things clearer as\r\ntime went on. Though it was an Hegelian mess of which I had partaken at\r\nCodger's table by way of a philosophical training, my sympathies have\r\nalways been Pragmatist. I belong almost by nature to that school of\r\nPragmatism that, following the medieval Nominalists, bases itself upon\r\na denial of the reality of classes, and of the validity of general\r\nlaws. The Baileys classified everything. They were, in the scholastic\r\nsense--which so oddly contradicts the modern use of the word “Realists.”\r\n They believed classes were REAL and independent of their individuals.\r\nThis is the common habit of all so-called educated people who have no\r\nmetaphysical aptitude and no metaphysical training. It leads them to a\r\nprogressive misunderstanding of the world. It was a favourite trick\r\nof Altiora's to speak of everybody as a “type”; she saw men as samples\r\nmoving; her dining-room became a chamber of representatives. It gave\r\na tremendously scientific air to many of their generalisations, using\r\n“scientific” in its nineteenth-century uncritical Herbert Spencer sense,\r\nan air that only began to disappear when you thought them over again in\r\nterms of actuality and the people one knew....\r\n\r\nAt the Baileys' one always seemed to be getting one's hands on the very\r\nstrings that guided the world. You heard legislation projected to affect\r\nthis “type” and that; statistics marched by you with sin and shame and\r\ninjustice and misery reduced to quite manageable percentages, you found\r\nmen who were to frame or amend bills in grave and intimate exchange\r\nwith Bailey's omniscience, you heard Altiora canvassing approaching\r\nresignations and possible appointments that might make or mar a\r\nrevolution in administrative methods, and doing it with a vigorous\r\ndirectness that manifestly swayed the decision; and you felt you were\r\nin a sort of signal box with levers all about you, and the world outside\r\nthere, albeit a little dark and mysterious beyond the window, running\r\non its lines in ready obedience to these unhesitating lights, true and\r\nsteady to trim termini.\r\n\r\nAnd then with all this administrative fizzle, this pseudo-scientific\r\nadministrative chatter, dying away in your head, out you went into the\r\nlimitless grimy chaos of London streets and squares, roads and avenues\r\nlined with teeming houses, each larger than the Chambers Street house\r\nand at least equally alive, you saw the chaotic clamour of hoardings,\r\nthe jumble of traffic, the coming and going of mysterious myriads,\r\nyou heard the rumble of traffic like the noise of a torrent; a vague\r\nincessant murmur of cries and voices, wanton crimes and accidents bawled\r\nat you from the placards; imperative unaccountable fashions swaggered\r\ntriumphant in dazzling windows of the shops; and you found yourself\r\nswaying back to the opposite conviction that the huge formless spirit\r\nof the world it was that held the strings and danced the puppets on the\r\nBailey stage....\r\n\r\nUnder the lamps you were jostled by people like my Staffordshire uncle\r\nout for a spree, you saw shy youths conversing with prostitutes, you\r\npassed young lovers pairing with an entire disregard of the social\r\nsuitability of the “types” they might blend or create, you saw men\r\nleaning drunken against lamp-posts whom you knew for the “type” that\r\nwill charge with fixed bayonets into the face of death, and you found\r\nyourself unable to imagine little Bailey achieving either drunkenness or\r\nthe careless defiance of annihilation. You realised that quite a lot of\r\ntypes were underrepresented in Chambers Street, that feral and obscure\r\nand altogether monstrous forces must be at work, as yet altogether\r\nunassimilated by those neat administrative reorganisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\nAltiora, I remember, preluded Margaret's reappearance by announcing her\r\nas a “new type.”\r\n\r\nI was accustomed to go early to the Baileys' dinners in those days, for\r\na preliminary gossip with Altiora in front of her drawing-room fire. One\r\ngot her alone, and that early arrival was a little sign of appreciation\r\nshe valued. She had every woman's need of followers and servants.\r\n\r\n“I'm going to send you down to-night,” she said, “with a very\r\ninteresting type indeed--one of the new generation of serious gals.\r\nMiddle-class origin--and quite well off. Rich in fact. Her step-father\r\nwas a solicitor and something of an ENTREPRENEUR towards the end, I\r\nfancy--in the Black Country. There was a little brother died, and she's\r\nlost her mother quite recently. Quite on her own, so to speak. She's\r\nnever been out into society very much, and doesn't seem really very\r\nanxious to go.... Not exactly an intellectual person, you know, but\r\nquiet, and great force of character. Came up to London on her own and\r\ncame to us--someone had told her we were the sort of people to advise\r\nher--to ask what to do. I'm sure she'll interest you.”\r\n\r\n“What CAN people of that sort do?” I asked. “Is she capable of\r\ninvestigation?”\r\n\r\nAltiora compressed her lips and shook her head. She always did shake her\r\nhead when you asked that of anyone.\r\n\r\n“Of course what she ought to do,” said Altiora, with her silk dress\r\npulled back from her knee before the fire, and with a lift of her voice\r\ntowards a chuckle at her daring way of putting things, “is to marry a\r\nmember of Parliament and see he does his work.... Perhaps she will.\r\nIt's a very exceptional gal who can do anything by herself--quite\r\nexceptional. The more serious they are--without being exceptional--the\r\nmore we want them to marry.”\r\n\r\nHer exposition was truncated by the entry of the type in question.\r\n\r\n“Well!” cried Altiora turning, and with a high note of welcome, “HERE\r\nyou are!”\r\n\r\nMargaret had gained in dignity and prettiness by the lapse of five\r\nyears, and she was now very beautifully and richly and simply dressed.\r\nHer fair hair had been done in some way that made it seem softer and\r\nmore abundant than it was in my memory, and a gleam of purple velvet-set\r\ndiamonds showed amidst its mist of little golden and brown lines.\r\nHer dress was of white and violet, the last trace of mourning for her\r\nmother, and confessed the gracious droop of her tall and slender body.\r\nShe did not suggest Staffordshire at all, and I was puzzled for a moment\r\nto think where I had met her. Her sweetly shaped mouth with the\r\nslight obliquity of the lip and the little kink in her brow were\r\nextraordinarily familiar to me. But she had either been prepared\r\nby Altiora or she remembered my name. “We met,” she said, “while my\r\nstep-father was alive--at Misterton. You came to see us”; and instantly\r\nI recalled the sunshine between the apple blossom and a slender pale\r\nblue girlish shape among the daffodils, like something that had sprung\r\nfrom a bulb itself. I recalled at once that I had found her very\r\ninteresting, though I did not clearly remember how it was she had\r\ninterested me.\r\n\r\nOther guests arrived--it was one of Altiora's boldly blended mixtures of\r\npeople with ideas and people with influence or money who might perhaps\r\nbe expected to resonate to them. Bailey came down late with an air of\r\nhurry, and was introduced to Margaret and said absolutely nothing to\r\nher--there being no information either to receive or impart and nothing\r\nto do--but stood snatching his left cheek until I rescued him and her,\r\nand left him free to congratulate the new Lady Snape on her husband's K.\r\nC. B.\r\n\r\nI took Margaret down. We achieved no feats of mutual expression, except\r\nthat it was abundantly clear we were both very pleased and interested\r\nto meet again, and that we had both kept memories of each other. We made\r\nthat Misterton tea-party and the subsequent marriages of my cousins\r\nand the world of Burslem generally, matter for quite an agreeable\r\nconversation until at last Altiora, following her invariable custom,\r\ncalled me by name imperatively out of our duologue. “Mr. Remington,” she\r\nsaid, “we want your opinion--” in her entirely characteristic effort to\r\nget all the threads of conversation into her own hands for the climax\r\nthat always wound up her dinners. How the other women used to hate those\r\nconcluding raids of hers! I forget most of the other people at that\r\ndinner, nor can I recall what the crowning rally was about. It didn't in\r\nany way join on to my impression of Margaret.\r\n\r\nIn the drawing-room of the matting floor I rejoined her, with Altiora's\r\nmanifest connivance, and in the interval I had been thinking of our\r\nformer meeting.\r\n\r\n“Do you find London,” I asked, “give you more opportunity for doing\r\nthings and learning things than Burslem?”\r\n\r\nShe showed at once she appreciated my allusion to her former\r\nconfidences. “I was very discontented then,” she said and paused. “I've\r\nreally only been in London for a few months. It's so different. In\r\nBurslem, life seems all business and getting--without any reason. One\r\nwent on and it didn't seem to mean anything. At least anything that\r\nmattered.... London seems to be so full of meanings--all mixed up\r\ntogether.”\r\n\r\nShe knitted her brows over her words and smiled appealingly at the end\r\nas if for consideration for her inadequate expression, appealingly and\r\nalmost humorously.\r\n\r\nI looked understandingly at her. “We have all,” I agreed, “to come to\r\nLondon.”\r\n\r\n“One sees so much distress,” she added, as if she felt she had\r\ncompletely omitted something, and needed a codicil.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing in London?”\r\n\r\n“I'm thinking of studying. Some social question. I thought perhaps I\r\nmight go and study social conditions as Mrs. Bailey did, go perhaps as\r\na work-girl or see the reality of living in, but Mrs. Bailey thought\r\nperhaps it wasn't quite my work.”\r\n\r\n“Are you studying?”\r\n\r\n“I'm going to a good many lectures, and perhaps I shall take up a\r\nregular course at the Westminster School of Politics and Sociology. But\r\nMrs. Bailey doesn't seem to believe very much in that either.”\r\n\r\nHer faintly whimsical smile returned. “I seem rather indefinite,” she\r\napologised, “but one does not want to get entangled in things one can't\r\ndo. One--one has so many advantages, one's life seems to be such a trust\r\nand such a responsibility--”\r\n\r\nShe stopped.\r\n\r\n“A man gets driven into work,” I said.\r\n\r\n“It must be splendid to be Mrs. Bailey,” she replied with a glance of\r\nenvious admiration across the room.\r\n\r\n“SHE has no doubts, anyhow,” I remarked.\r\n\r\n“She HAD,” said Margaret with the pride of one who has received great\r\nconfidences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\r\n“You've met before?” said Altiora, a day or so later.\r\n\r\nI explained when.\r\n\r\n“You find her interesting?”\r\n\r\nI saw in a flash that Altiora meant to marry me to Margaret.\r\n\r\nHer intention became much clearer as the year developed. Altiora was\r\nsystematic even in matters that evade system. I was to marry Margaret,\r\nand freed from the need of making an income I was to come into\r\npolitics--as an exponent of Baileyism. She put it down with the other\r\nexcellent and advantageous things that should occupy her summer holiday.\r\nIt was her pride and glory to put things down and plan them out in\r\ndetail beforehand, and I'm not quite sure that she did not even mark\r\noff the day upon which the engagement was to be declared. If she did,\r\nI disappointed her. We didn't come to an engagement, in spite of the\r\nbroadest hints and the glaring obviousness of everything, that summer.\r\n\r\nEvery summer the Baileys went out of London to some house they hired\r\nor borrowed, leaving their secretaries toiling behind, and they went\r\non working hard in the mornings and evenings and taking exercise in the\r\nopen air in the afternoon. They cycled assiduously and went for long\r\nwalks at a trot, and raided and studied (and incidentally explained\r\nthemselves to) any social “types” that lived in the neighbourhood. One\r\ninvaded type, resentful under research, described them with a dreadful\r\naptness as Donna Quixote and Sancho Panza--and himself as a harmless\r\nwindmill, hurting no one and signifying nothing. She did rather tilt\r\nat things. This particular summer they were at a pleasant farmhouse in\r\nlevel country near Pangbourne, belonging to the Hon. Wilfrid Winchester,\r\nand they asked me to come down to rooms in the neighbourhood--Altiora\r\ntook them for a month for me in August--and board with them upon\r\nextremely reasonable terms; and when I got there I found Margaret\r\nsitting in a hammock at Altiora's feet. Lots of people, I gathered, were\r\ncoming and going in the neighbourhood, the Ponts were in a villa on the\r\nriver, and the Rickhams' houseboat was to moor for some days; but these\r\nirruptions did not impede a great deal of duologue between Margaret and\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nAltiora was efficient rather than artistic in her match-making. She sent\r\nus off for long walks together--Margaret was a fairly good walker--she\r\nexhumed some defective croquet things and incited us to croquet, not\r\nunderstanding that detestable game is the worst stimulant for lovers\r\nin the world. And Margaret and I were always getting left about, and\r\nfinding ourselves for odd half-hours in the kitchen-garden with nothing\r\nto do except talk, or we were told with a wave of the hand to run away\r\nand amuse each other.\r\n\r\nAltiora even tried a picnic in canoes, knowing from fiction rather than\r\nimagination or experience the conclusive nature of such excursions. But\r\nthere she fumbled at the last moment, and elected at the river's brink\r\nto share a canoe with me. Bailey showed so much zeal and so little\r\nskill--his hat fell off and he became miraculously nothing but\r\npaddle-clutching hands and a vast wrinkled brow--that at last he had to\r\nbe paddled ignominiously by Margaret, while Altiora, after a phase of\r\nrigid discretion, as nearly as possible drowned herself--and me no doubt\r\ninto the bargain--with a sudden lateral gesture of the arm to emphasise\r\nthe high note with which she dismissed the efficiency of the Charity\r\nOrganisation Society. We shipped about an inch of water and sat in it\r\nfor the rest of the time, an inconvenience she disregarded heroically.\r\nWe had difficulties in landing Oscar from his frail craft upon the ait\r\nof our feasting,--he didn't balance sideways and was much alarmed, and\r\nafterwards, as Margaret had a pain in her back, I took him in my canoe,\r\nlet him hide his shame with an ineffectual but not positively harmful\r\npaddle, and towed the other by means of the joined painters. Still it\r\nwas the fault of the inadequate information supplied in the books and\r\nnot of Altiora that that was not the date of my betrothal.\r\n\r\nI find it not a little difficult to state what kept me back from\r\nproposing marriage to Margaret that summer, and what urged me forward\r\nat last to marry her. It is so much easier to remember one's resolutions\r\nthan to remember the moods and suggestions that produced them.\r\n\r\nMarrying and getting married was, I think, a pretty simple affair to\r\nAltiora; it was something that happened to the adolescent and unmarried\r\nwhen you threw them together under the circumstances of health, warmth\r\nand leisure. It happened with the kindly and approving smiles of the\r\nmore experienced elders who had organised these proximities. The young\r\npeople married, settled down, children ensued, and father and mother\r\nturned their minds, now decently and properly disillusioned, to other\r\nthings. That to Altiora was the normal sexual life, and she believed it\r\nto be the quality of the great bulk of the life about her.\r\n\r\nOne of the great barriers to human understanding is the wide\r\ntemperamental difference one finds in the values of things relating to\r\nsex. It is the issue upon which people most need training in charity and\r\nimaginative sympathy. Here are no universal standards at all, and indeed\r\nfor no single man nor woman does there seem to be any fixed standard, so\r\nmuch do the accidents of circumstances and one's physical phases affect\r\none's interpretations. There is nothing in the whole range of sexual\r\nfact that may not seem supremely beautiful or humanly jolly or\r\nmagnificently wicked or disgusting or trivial or utterly insignificant,\r\naccording to the eye that sees or the mood that colours. Here is\r\nsomething that may fill the skies and every waking hour or be almost\r\ncompletely banished from a life. It may be everything on Monday and less\r\nthan nothing on Saturday. And we make our laws and rules as though in\r\nthese matters all men and women were commensurable one with another,\r\nwith an equal steadfast passion and an equal constant duty....\r\n\r\nI don't know what dreams Altiora may have had in her schoolroom days, I\r\nalways suspected her of suppressed and forgotten phases, but certainly\r\nher general effect now was of an entirely passionless worldliness in\r\nthese matters. Indeed so far as I could get at her, she regarded sexual\r\npassion as being hardly more legitimate in a civilised person than--let\r\nus say--homicidal mania. She must have forgotten--and Bailey too. I\r\nsuspect she forgot before she married him. I don't suppose either of\r\nthem had the slightest intimation of the dimensions sexual love can take\r\nin the thoughts of the great majority of people with whom they come in\r\ncontact. They loved in their way--an intellectual way it was and a fond\r\nway--but it had no relation to beauty and physical sensation--except\r\nthat there seemed a decree of exile against these things. They got their\r\nglow in high moments of altruistic ambition--and in moments of vivid\r\nworldly success. They sat at opposite ends of their dinner table with so\r\nand so “captured,” and so and so, flushed with a mutual approval. They\r\nsaw people in love forgetful and distraught about them, and just put it\r\ndown to forgetfulness and distraction. At any rate Altiora manifestly\r\nviewed my situation and Margaret's with an abnormal and entirely\r\nmisleading simplicity. There was the girl, rich, with an acceptable\r\nclaim to be beautiful, shiningly virtuous, quite capable of political\r\ninterests, and there was I, talented, ambitious and full of\r\npolitical and social passion, in need of just the money, devotion and\r\nregularisation Margaret could provide. We were both unmarried--white\r\nsheets of uninscribed paper. Was there ever a simpler situation? What\r\nmore could we possibly want?\r\n\r\nShe was even a little offended at the inconclusiveness that did not\r\nsettle things at Pangbourne. I seemed to her, I suspect, to reflect upon\r\nher judgment and good intentions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\nI didn't see things with Altiora's simplicity.\r\n\r\nI admired Margaret very much, I was fully aware of all that she and I\r\nmight give each other; indeed so far as Altiora went we were quite in\r\nagreement. But what seemed solid ground to Altiora and the ultimate\r\nfooting of her emasculated world, was to me just the superficial\r\ncovering of a gulf--oh! abysses of vague and dim, and yet stupendously\r\nsignificant things.\r\n\r\nI couldn't dismiss the interests and the passion of sex as Altiora did.\r\nWork, I agreed, was important; career and success; but deep unanalysable\r\ninstincts told me this preoccupation was a thing quite as important;\r\ndangerous, interfering, destructive indeed, but none the less a\r\ndominating interest in life. I have told how flittingly and uninvited it\r\ncame like a moth from the outer twilight into my life, how it grew in me\r\nwith my manhood, how it found its way to speech and grew daring, and led\r\nme at last to experience. After that adventure at Locarno sex and the\r\ninterests and desires of sex never left me for long at peace. I went on\r\nwith my work and my career, and all the time it was like--like someone\r\ntalking ever and again in a room while one tries to write.\r\n\r\nThere were times when I could have wished the world a world all of men,\r\nso greatly did this unassimilated series of motives and curiosities\r\nhamper me; and times when I could have wished the world all of women.\r\nI seemed always to be seeking something in women, in girls, and I\r\nwas never clear what it was I was seeking. But never--even at my\r\ncoarsest--was I moved by physical desire alone. Was I seeking help and\r\nfellowship? Was I seeking some intimacy with beauty? It was a thing too\r\nformless to state, that I seemed always desiring to attain and never\r\nattaining. Waves of gross sensuousness arose out of this preoccupation,\r\ncarried me to a crisis of gratification or disappointment that was\r\nclearly not the needed thing; they passed and left my mind free again\r\nfor a time to get on with the permanent pursuits of my life. And then\r\npresently this solicitude would have me again, an irrelevance as it\r\nseemed, and yet a constantly recurring demand.\r\n\r\nI don't want particularly to dwell upon things that are disagreeable\r\nfor others to read, but I cannot leave them out of my story and get the\r\nright proportions of the forces I am balancing. I was no abnormal man,\r\nand that world of order we desire to make must be built of such stuff as\r\nI was and am and can beget. You cannot have a world of Baileys; it would\r\nend in one orderly generation. Humanity is begotten in Desire, lives by\r\nDesire.\r\n\r\n\r\n     “Love which is lust, is the Lamp in the Tomb;\r\n      Love which is lust, is the Call from the Gloom.”\r\n\r\n\r\nI echo Henley.\r\n\r\nI suppose the life of celibacy which the active, well-fed,\r\nwell-exercised and imaginatively stirred young man of the educated\r\nclasses is supposed to lead from the age of nineteen or twenty,\r\nwhen Nature certainly meant him to marry, to thirty or more, when\r\ncivilisation permits him to do so, is the most impossible thing in the\r\nworld. We deal here with facts that are kept secret and obscure, but\r\nI doubt for my own part if more than one man out of five in our class\r\nsatisfies that ideal demand. The rest are even as I was, and Hatherleigh\r\nand Esmeer and all the men I knew. I draw no lessons and offer no\r\npanacea; I have to tell the quality of life, and this is how it is. This\r\nis how it will remain until men and women have the courage to face the\r\nfacts of life.\r\n\r\nI was no systematic libertine, you must understand; things happened to\r\nme and desire drove me. Any young man would have served for that Locarno\r\nadventure, and after that what had been a mystic and wonderful thing\r\npassed rapidly into a gross, manifestly misdirected and complicating\r\none. I can count a meagre tale of five illicit loves in the days of my\r\nyouth, to include that first experience, and of them all only two were\r\nsustained relationships. Besides these five “affairs,” on one or two\r\noccasions I dipped so low as the inky dismal sensuality of the streets,\r\nand made one of those pairs of correlated figures, the woman in her\r\nsqualid finery sailing homeward, the man modestly aloof and behind, that\r\nevery night in the London year flit by the score of thousands across the\r\nsight of the observant....\r\n\r\nHow ugly it is to recall; ugly and shameful now without qualification!\r\nYet at the time there was surely something not altogether ugly in\r\nit--something that has vanished, some fine thing mortally ailing.\r\n\r\nOne such occasion I recall as if it were a vision deep down in a pit,\r\nas if it had happened in another state of existence to someone else. And\r\nyet it is the sort of thing that has happened, once or twice at least,\r\nto half the men in London who have been in a position to make it\r\npossible. Let me try and give you its peculiar effect. Man or woman, you\r\nought to know of it.\r\n\r\nFigure to yourself a dingy room, somewhere in that network of streets\r\nthat lies about Tottenham Court Road, a dingy bedroom lit by a solitary\r\ncandle and carpeted with scraps and patches, with curtains of cretonne\r\nclosing the window, and a tawdry ornament of paper in the grate. I sit\r\non a bed beside a weary-eyed, fair-haired, sturdy young woman, half\r\nundressed, who is telling me in broken German something that my\r\nknowledge of German is at first inadequate to understand....\r\n\r\nI thought she was boasting about her family, and then slowly the meaning\r\ncame to me. She was a Lett from near Libau in Courland, and she was\r\ntelling me--just as one tells something too strange for comment or\r\nemotion--how her father had been shot and her sister outraged and\r\nmurdered before her eyes.\r\n\r\nIt was as if one had dipped into something primordial and stupendous\r\nbeneath the smooth and trivial surfaces of life. There was I, you know,\r\nthe promising young don from Cambridge, who wrote quite brilliantly\r\nabout politics and might presently get into Parliament, with my collar\r\nand tie in my hand, and a certain sense of shameful adventure fading out\r\nof my mind.\r\n\r\n“Ach Gott!” she sighed by way of comment, and mused deeply for a\r\nmoment before she turned her face to me, as to something forgotten and\r\nremembered, and assumed the half-hearted meretricious smile.\r\n\r\n“Bin ich eine hubsche?” she asked like one who repeats a lesson.\r\n\r\nI was moved to crave her pardon and come away.\r\n\r\n“Bin ich eine hubsche?” she asked a little anxiously, laying a detaining\r\nhand upon me, and evidently not understanding a word of what I was\r\nstriving to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\n\r\nI find it extraordinarily difficult to recall the phases by which\r\nI passed from my first admiration of Margaret's earnestness and\r\nunconscious daintiness to an intimate acquaintance. The earlier\r\nencounters stand out clear and hard, but then the impressions become\r\ncrowded and mingle not only with each other but with all the subsequent\r\ndevelopments of relationship, the enormous evolutions of interpretation\r\nand comprehension between husband and wife. Dipping into my memories is\r\nlike dipping into a ragbag, one brings out this memory or that, with no\r\nintimation of how they came in time or what led to them and joined them\r\ntogether. And they are all mixed up with subsequent associations,\r\nwith sympathies and discords, habits of intercourse, surprises and\r\ndisappointments and discovered misunderstandings. I know only that\r\nalways my feelings for Margaret were complicated feelings, woven of many\r\nand various strands.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the curious neglected aspects of life how at the same time\r\nand in relation to the same reality we can have in our minds streams of\r\nthought at quite different levels. We can be at the same time idealising\r\na person and seeing and criticising that person quite coldly and\r\nclearly, and we slip unconsciously from level to level and produce\r\nall sorts of inconsistent acts. In a sense I had no illusions about\r\nMargaret; in a sense my conception of Margaret was entirely poetic\r\nillusion. I don't think I was ever blind to certain defects of hers, and\r\nquite as certainly they didn't seem to matter in the slightest degree.\r\nHer mind had a curious want of vigour, “flatness” is the only word; she\r\nnever seemed to escape from her phrase; her way of thinking, her way of\r\ndoing was indecisive; she remained in her attitude, it did not flow out\r\nto easy, confirmatory action.\r\n\r\nI saw this quite clearly, and when we walked and talked together I\r\nseemed always trying for animation in her and never finding it. I would\r\nstate my ideas. “I know,” she would say, “I know.”\r\n\r\nI talked about myself and she listened wonderfully, but she made no\r\nanswering revelations. I talked politics, and she remarked with her blue\r\neyes wide and earnest: “Every WORD you say seems so just.”\r\n\r\nI admired her appearance tremendously but--I can only express it by\r\nsaying I didn't want to touch her. Her fair hair was always delectably\r\ndone. It flowed beautifully over her pretty small ears, and she would\r\ntie its fair coilings with fillets of black or blue velvet that carried\r\npretty buckles of silver and paste. The light, the faint down on her\r\nbrow and cheek was delightful. And it was clear to me that I made her\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\nMy sense of her deficiencies didn't stand in the way of my falling at\r\nlast very deeply in love with her. Her very shortcomings seemed to offer\r\nme something....\r\n\r\nShe stood in my mind for goodness--and for things from which it seemed\r\nto me my hold was slipping.\r\n\r\nShe seemed to promise a way of escape from the deepening opposition in\r\nme between physical passions and the constructive career, the career\r\nof wide aims and human service, upon which I had embarked. All the time\r\nthat I was seeing her as a beautiful, fragile, rather ineffective girl,\r\nI was also seeing her just as consciously as a shining slender figure,\r\na radiant reconciliation, coming into my darkling disorders of lust and\r\nimpulse. I could understand clearly that she was incapable of the most\r\nnecessary subtleties of political thought, and yet I could contemplate\r\npraying to her and putting all the intricate troubles of my life at her\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nBefore the reappearance of Margaret in my world at all an unwonted\r\ndisgust with the consequences and quality of my passions had arisen in\r\nmy mind. Among other things that moment with the Lettish girl haunted\r\nme persistently. I would see myself again and again sitting amidst those\r\nsluttish surroundings, collar and tie in hand, while her heavy German\r\nwords grouped themselves to a slowly apprehended meaning. I would\r\nfeel again with a fresh stab of remorse, that this was not a flash of\r\nadventure, this was not seeing life in any permissible sense, but a dip\r\ninto tragedy, dishonour, hideous degradation, and the pitiless cruelty\r\nof a world as yet uncontrolled by any ordered will.\r\n\r\n“Good God!” I put it to myself, “that I should finish the work those\r\nCossacks had begun! I who want order and justice before everything!\r\nThere's no way out of it, no decent excuse! If I didn't think, I ought\r\nto have thought!”...\r\n\r\n“How did I get to it?”... I would ransack the phases of my development\r\nfrom the first shy unveiling of a hidden wonder to the last extremity as\r\na man will go through muddled account books to find some disorganising\r\nerror....\r\n\r\nI was also involved at that time--I find it hard to place these things\r\nin the exact order of their dates because they were so disconnected\r\nwith the regular progress of my work and life--in an intrigue, a clumsy,\r\nsensuous, pretentious, artificially stimulated intrigue, with a Mrs.\r\nLarrimer, a woman living separated from her husband. I will not go\r\ninto particulars of that episode, nor how we quarrelled and chafed one\r\nanother. She was at once unfaithful and jealous and full of whims\r\nabout our meetings; she was careless of our secret, and vulgarised our\r\nrelationship by intolerable interpretations; except for some glowing\r\nmoments of gratification, except for the recurrent and essentially\r\nvicious desire that drew us back to each other again, we both fretted at\r\na vexatious and unexpectedly binding intimacy. The interim was full\r\nof the quality of work delayed, of time and energy wasted, of insecure\r\nprecautions against scandal and exposure. Disappointment is almost\r\ninherent in illicit love. I had, and perhaps it was part of her\r\nrecurrent irritation also, a feeling as though one had followed\r\nsomething fine and beautiful into a net--into bird lime! These furtive\r\nscuffles, this sneaking into shabby houses of assignation, was what we\r\nhad made out of the suggestion of pagan beauty; this was the reality\r\nof our vision of nymphs and satyrs dancing for the joy of life amidst\r\nincessant sunshine. We had laid hands upon the wonder and glory of\r\nbodily love and wasted them....\r\n\r\nIt was the sense of waste, of finely beautiful possibilities getting\r\nentangled and marred for ever that oppressed me. I had missed, I had\r\nlost. I did not turn from these things after the fashion of the Baileys,\r\nas one turns from something low and embarrassing. I felt that these\r\ngreat organic forces were still to be wrought into a harmony with my\r\nconstructive passion. I felt too that I was not doing it. I had not\r\nunderstood the forces in this struggle nor its nature, and as I learnt\r\nI failed. I had been started wrong, I had gone on wrong, in a world that\r\nwas muddled and confused, full of false counsel and erratic shames and\r\ntwisted temptations. I learnt to see it so by failures that were perhaps\r\ndestroying any chance of profit in my lessons. Moods of clear keen\r\nindustry alternated with moods of relapse and indulgence and moods of\r\ndubiety and remorse. I was not going on as the Baileys thought I was\r\ngoing on. There were times when the blindness of the Baileys irritated\r\nme intensely. Beneath the ostensible success of those years, between\r\ntwenty-three and twenty-eight, this rottenness, known to scarcely\r\nany one but myself, grew and spread. My sense of the probability of\r\na collapse intensified. I knew indeed now, even as Willersley had\r\nprophesied five years before, that I was entangling myself in something\r\nthat might smother all my uses in the world. Down there among those\r\nincommunicable difficulties, I was puzzled and blundering. I was losing\r\nmy hold upon things; the chaotic and adventurous element in life was\r\nspreading upward and getting the better of me, over-mastering me and all\r\nmy will to rule and make.... And the strength, the drugging urgency of\r\nthe passion!\r\n\r\nMargaret shone at times in my imagination like a radiant angel in a\r\nworld of mire and disorder, in a world of cravings, hot and dull red\r\nlike scars inflamed....\r\n\r\nI suppose it was because I had so great a need of such help as her\r\nwhiteness proffered, that I could ascribe impossible perfections to\r\nher, a power of intellect, a moral power and patience to which she, poor\r\nfellow mortal, had indeed no claim. If only a few of us WERE angels and\r\nfreed from the tangle of effort, how easy life might be! I wanted her so\r\nbadly, so very badly, to be what I needed. I wanted a woman to save me.\r\nI forced myself to see her as I wished to see her. Her tepidities became\r\ninfinite delicacies, her mental vagueness an atmospheric realism. The\r\nharsh precisions of the Baileys and Altiora's blunt directness threw up\r\nher fineness into relief and made a grace of every weakness.\r\n\r\nMixed up with the memory of times when I talked with Margaret as one\r\ntalks politely to those who are hopelessly inferior in mental quality,\r\nexplaining with a false lucidity, welcoming and encouraging the feeblest\r\nresponse, when possible moulding and directing, are times when I did\r\nindeed, as the old phrase goes, worship the ground she trod on. I was\r\nequally honest and unconscious of inconsistency at each extreme. But in\r\nneither phase could I find it easy to make love to Margaret. For in the\r\nfirst I did not want to, though I talked abundantly to her of marriage\r\nand so forth, and was a little puzzled at myself for not going on to\r\nsome personal application, and in the second she seemed inaccessible, I\r\nfelt I must make confessions and put things before her that would be the\r\ngrossest outrage upon the noble purity I attributed to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\n\r\nI went to Margaret at last to ask her to marry me, wrought up to the\r\nmood of one who stakes his life on a cast. Separated from her, and with\r\nthe resonance of an evening of angry recriminations with Mrs. Larrimer\r\nechoing in my mind, I discovered myself to be quite passionately in\r\nlove with Margaret. Last shreds of doubt vanished. It has always been a\r\nfeature of our relationship that Margaret absent means more to me than\r\nMargaret present; her memory distils from its dross and purifies in\r\nme. All my criticisms and qualifications of her vanished into some dark\r\ncorner of my mind. She was the lady of my salvation; I must win my way\r\nto her or perish.\r\n\r\nI went to her at last, for all that I knew she loved me, in passionate\r\nself-abasement, white and a-tremble. She was staying with the Rockleys\r\nat Woking, for Shena Rockley had been at Bennett Hall with her and they\r\nhad resumed a close intimacy; and I went down to her on an impulse,\r\nunheralded. I was kept waiting for some minutes, I remember, in a little\r\nroom upon which a conservatory opened, a conservatory full of pots\r\nof large mauve-edged, white cyclamens in flower. And there was a big\r\nlacquer cabinet, a Chinese thing, I suppose, of black and gold against\r\nthe red-toned wall. To this day the thought of Margaret is inseparably\r\nbound up with the sight of a cyclamen's back-turned petals.\r\n\r\nShe came in, looking pale and drooping rather more than usual. I\r\nsuddenly realised that Altiora's hint of a disappointment leading to\r\npositive illness was something more than a vindictive comment. She\r\nclosed the door and came across to me and took and dropped my hand and\r\nstood still. “What is it you want with me?” she asked.\r\n\r\nThe speech I had been turning over and over in my mind on the way\r\nvanished at the sight of her.\r\n\r\n“I want to talk to you,” I answered lamely.\r\n\r\nFor some seconds neither of us said a word.\r\n\r\n“I want to tell you things about my life,” I began.\r\n\r\nShe answered with a scarcely audible “yes.”\r\n\r\n“I almost asked you to marry me at Pangbourne,” I plunged. “I didn't. I\r\ndidn't because--because you had too much to give me.”\r\n\r\n“Too much!” she echoed, “to give you!” She had lifted her eyes to my\r\nface and the colour was coming into her cheeks.\r\n\r\n“Don't misunderstand me,” I said hastily. “I want to tell you things,\r\nthings you don't know. Don't answer me. I want to tell you.”\r\n\r\nShe stood before the fireplace with her ultimate answer shining through\r\nthe quiet of her face. “Go on,” she said, very softly. It was so\r\npitilessly manifest she was resolved to idealise the situation whatever\r\nI might say. I began walking up and down the room between those\r\ncyclamens and the cabinet. There were little gold fishermen on the\r\ncabinet fishing from little islands that each had a pagoda and a tree,\r\nand there were also men in boats or something, I couldn't determine\r\nwhat, and some obscure sub-office in my mind concerned itself with that\r\nquite intently. Yet I seem to have been striving with all my being\r\nto get words for the truth of things. “You see,” I emerged, “you make\r\neverything possible to me. You can give me help and sympathy, support,\r\nunderstanding. You know my political ambitions. You know all that I\r\nmight do in the world. I do so intensely want to do constructive things,\r\nbig things perhaps, in this wild jumble.... Only you don't know a bit\r\nwhat I am. I want to tell you what I am. I'm complex.... I'm streaked.”\r\n\r\nI glanced at her, and she was regarding me with an expression of\r\nblissful disregard for any meaning I was seeking to convey.\r\n\r\n“You see,” I said, “I'm a bad man.”\r\n\r\nShe sounded a note of valiant incredulity.\r\n\r\nEverything seemed to be slipping away from me. I pushed on to the ugly\r\nfacts that remained over from the wreck of my interpretation. “What\r\nhas held me back,” I said, “is the thought that you could not possibly\r\nunderstand certain things in my life. Men are not pure as women are. I\r\nhave had love affairs. I mean I have had affairs. Passion--desire. You\r\nsee, I have had a mistress, I have been entangled--”\r\n\r\nShe seemed about to speak, but I interrupted. “I'm not telling you,” I\r\nsaid, “what I meant to tell you. I want you to know clearly that there\r\nis another side to my life, a dirty side. Deliberately I say, dirty. It\r\ndidn't seem so at first--”\r\n\r\nI stopped blankly. “Dirty,” I thought, was the most idiotic choice of\r\nwords to have made.\r\n\r\nI had never in any tolerable sense of the word been dirty.\r\n\r\n“I drifted into this--as men do,” I said after a little pause and\r\nstopped again.\r\n\r\nShe was looking at me with her wide blue eyes.\r\n\r\n“Did you imagine,” she began, “that I thought you--that I expected--”\r\n\r\n“But how can you know?”\r\n\r\n“I know. I do know.”\r\n\r\n“But--” I began.\r\n\r\n“I know,” she persisted, dropping her eyelids. “Of course I know,” and\r\nnothing could have convinced me more completely that she did not know.\r\n\r\n“All men--” she generalised. “A woman does not understand these\r\ntemptations.”\r\n\r\nI was astonished beyond measure at her way of taking my confession. ...\r\n\r\n“Of course,” she said, hesitating a little over a transparent\r\ndifficulty, “it is all over and past.”\r\n\r\n“It's all over and past,” I answered.\r\n\r\nThere was a little pause.\r\n\r\n“I don't want to know,” she said. “None of that seems to matter now in\r\nthe slightest degree.”\r\n\r\nShe looked up and smiled as though we had exchanged some acceptable\r\ncommonplaces. “Poor dear!” she said, dismissing everything, and put out\r\nher arms, and it seemed to me that I could hear the Lettish girl in\r\nthe background--doomed safety valve of purity in this intolerable\r\nworld--telling something in indistinguishable German--I know not what\r\nnor why....\r\n\r\nI took Margaret in my arms and kissed her. Her eyes were wet with tears.\r\nShe clung to me and was near, I felt, to sobbing.\r\n\r\n“I have loved you,” she whispered presently, “Oh! ever since we met in\r\nMisterton--six years and more ago.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE THIRD ~~ MARGARET IN VENICE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nThere comes into my mind a confused memory of conversations with\r\nMargaret; we must have had dozens altogether, and they mix in now for\r\nthe most part inextricably not only with one another, but with later\r\ntalks and with things we discussed at Pangbourne. We had the immensest\r\nanticipations of the years and opportunities that lay before us. I was\r\nnow very deeply in love with her indeed. I felt not that I had cleaned\r\nup my life but that she had. We called each other “confederate” I\r\nremember, and made during our brief engagement a series of visits to the\r\nvarious legislative bodies in London, the County Council, the House of\r\nCommons, where we dined with Villiers, and the St. Pancras Vestry, where\r\nwe heard Shaw speaking. I was full of plans and so was she of the way\r\nin which we were to live and work. We were to pay back in public service\r\nwhatever excess of wealth beyond his merits old Seddon's economic\r\nadvantage had won for him from the toiling people in the potteries. The\r\nend of the Boer War was so recent that that blessed word “efficiency”\r\n echoed still in people's minds and thoughts. Lord Roseberry in a\r\nmemorable oration had put it into the heads of the big outer public, but\r\nthe Baileys with a certain show of justice claimed to have set it going\r\nin the channels that took it to him--if as a matter of fact it was taken\r\nto him. But then it was their habit to make claims of that sort. They\r\ncertainly did their share to keep “efficient” going. Altiora's\r\nhighest praise was “thoroughly efficient.” We were to be a “thoroughly\r\nefficient” political couple of the “new type.” She explained us to\r\nherself and Oscar, she explained us to ourselves, she explained us to\r\nthe people who came to her dinners and afternoons until the world was\r\nhighly charged with explanation and expectation, and the proposal that I\r\nshould be the Liberal candidate for the Kinghamstead Division seemed the\r\nmost natural development in the world.\r\n\r\nI was full of the ideal of hard restrained living and relentless\r\nactivity, and throughout a beautiful November at Venice, where chiefly\r\nwe spent our honeymoon, we turned over and over again and discussed in\r\nevery aspect our conception of a life tremendously focussed upon the\r\nideal of social service.\r\n\r\nMost clearly there stands out a picture of ourselves talking in a\r\ngondola on our way to Torcella. Far away behind us the smoke of Murano\r\nforms a black stain upon an immense shining prospect of smooth water,\r\nwater as unruffled and luminous as the sky above, a mirror on which rows\r\nof posts and distant black high-stemmed, swan-necked boats with their\r\nminutely clear swinging gondoliers, float aerially. Remote and low\r\nbefore us rises the little tower of our destination. Our men swing\r\ntogether and their oars swirl leisurely through the water, hump back in\r\nthe rowlocks, splash sharply and go swishing back again. Margaret lies\r\nback on cushions, with her face shaded by a holland parasol, and I sit\r\nup beside her.\r\n\r\n“You see,” I say, and in spite of Margaret's note of perfect\r\nacquiescence I feel myself reasoning against an indefinable antagonism,\r\n“it is so easy to fall into a slack way with life. There may seem to be\r\nsomething priggish in a meticulous discipline, but otherwise it is\r\nso easy to slip into indolent habits--and to be distracted from one's\r\npurpose. The country, the world, wants men to serve its constructive\r\nneeds, to work out and carry out plans. For a man who has to make a\r\nliving the enemy is immediate necessity; for people like ourselves\r\nit's--it's the constant small opportunity of agreeable things.”\r\n\r\n“Frittering away,” she says, “time and strength.”\r\n\r\n“That is what I feel. It's so pleasant to pretend one is simply modest,\r\nit looks so foolish at times to take one's self too seriously. We've GOT\r\nto take ourselves seriously.”\r\n\r\nShe endorses my words with her eyes.\r\n\r\n“I feel I can do great things with life.”\r\n\r\n“I KNOW you can.”\r\n\r\n“But that's only to be done by concentrating one's life upon one main\r\nend. We have to plan our days, to make everything subserve our scheme.”\r\n\r\n“I feel,” she answers softly, “we ought to give--every hour.”\r\n\r\nHer face becomes dreamy. “I WANT to give every hour,” she adds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\nThat holiday in Venice is set in my memory like a little artificial lake\r\nin uneven confused country, as something very bright and skylike, and\r\ndiscontinuous with all about it. The faded quality of the very sunshine\r\nof that season, the mellow discoloured palaces and places, the huge,\r\ntime-ripened paintings of departed splendours, the whispering, nearly\r\nnoiseless passage of hearse-black gondolas, for the horrible steam\r\nlaunch had not yet ruined Venice, the stilled magnificences of the\r\ndepopulated lagoons, the universal autumn, made me feel altogether in\r\nrecess from the teeming uproars of reality. There was not a dozen people\r\nall told, no Americans and scarcely any English, to dine in the big\r\ncavern of a dining-room, with its vistas of separate tables, its\r\ndistempered walls and its swathed chandeliers. We went about seeing\r\nbeautiful things, accepting beauty on every hand, and taking it for\r\ngranted that all was well with ourselves and the world. It was ten days\r\nor a fortnight before I became fretful and anxious for action; a long\r\ntranquillity for such a temperament as mine.\r\n\r\nOur pleasures were curiously impersonal, a succession of shared\r\naesthetic appreciation threads all that time. Our honeymoon was no\r\nexultant coming together, no mutual shout of “YOU!” We were almost shy\r\nwith one another, and felt the relief of even a picture to help us\r\nout. It was entirely in my conception of things that I should be very\r\nwatchful not to shock or distress Margaret or press the sensuous note.\r\nOur love-making had much of the tepid smoothness of the lagoons.\r\nWe talked in delicate innuendo of what should be glorious freedoms.\r\nMargaret had missed Verona and Venice in her previous Italian\r\njourney--fear of the mosquito had driven her mother across Italy to the\r\nwestward route--and now she could fill up her gaps and see the Titians\r\nand Paul Veroneses she already knew in colourless photographs, the\r\nCarpaccios, (the St. George series delighted her beyond measure,)\r\nthe Basaitis and that great statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni that Ruskin\r\npraised.\r\n\r\nBut since I am not a man to look at pictures and architectural effects\r\nday after day, I did watch Margaret very closely and store a thousand\r\nmemories of her. I can see her now, her long body drooping a little\r\nforward, her sweet face upraised to some discovered familiar masterpiece\r\nand shining with a delicate enthusiasm. I can hear again the soft\r\ncadences of her voice murmuring commonplace comments, for she had no\r\ngift of expressing the shapeless satisfaction these things gave her.\r\n\r\nMargaret, I perceived, was a cultivated person, the first cultivated\r\nperson with whom I had ever come into close contact. She was cultivated\r\nand moral, and I, I now realise, was never either of these things. She\r\nwas passive, and I am active. She did not simply and naturally look\r\nfor beauty but she had been incited to look for it at school, and took\r\nperhaps a keener interest in books and lectures and all the organisation\r\nof beautiful things than she did in beauty itself; she found much of her\r\ndelight in being guided to it. Now a thing ceases to be beautiful to me\r\nwhen some finger points me out its merits. Beauty is the salt of life,\r\nbut I take my beauty as a wild beast gets its salt, as a constituent of\r\nthe meal....\r\n\r\nAnd besides, there was that between us that should have seemed more\r\nbeautiful than any picture....\r\n\r\nSo we went about Venice tracking down pictures and spiral staircases and\r\nsuch-like things, and my brains were busy all the time with such things\r\nas a comparison of Venice and its nearest modern equivalent, New York,\r\nwith the elaboration of schemes of action when we returned to London,\r\nwith the development of a theory of Margaret.\r\n\r\nOur marriage had done this much at least, that it had fused and\r\ndestroyed those two independent ways of thinking about her that had gone\r\non in my mind hitherto. Suddenly she had become very near to me, and a\r\nvery big thing, a sort of comprehensive generalisation behind a thousand\r\nquestions, like the sky or England. The judgments and understandings\r\nthat had worked when she was, so to speak, miles away from my life,\r\nhad now to be altogether revised. Trifling things began to matter\r\nenormously, that she had a weak and easily fatigued back, for example,\r\nor that when she knitted her brows and stammered a little in talking,\r\nit didn't really mean that an exquisite significance struggled for\r\nutterance.\r\n\r\nWe visited pictures in the mornings chiefly. In the afternoon, unless we\r\nwere making a day-long excursion in a gondola, Margaret would rest for\r\nan hour while I prowled about in search of English newspapers, and then\r\nwe would go to tea in the Piazza San Marco and watch the drift of people\r\nfeeding the pigeons and going into the little doors beneath the sunlit\r\narches and domes of Saint Mark's. Then perhaps we would stroll on the\r\nPiazzetta, or go out into the sunset in a gondola. Margaret became very\r\ninterested in the shops that abound under the colonnades and decided at\r\nlast to make an extensive purchase of table glass. “These things,” she\r\nsaid, “are quite beautiful, and far cheaper than anything but the most\r\nordinary looking English ware.” I was interested in her idea, and a good\r\ndeal charmed by the delightful qualities of tinted shape, slender handle\r\nand twisted stem. I suggested we should get not simply tumblers\r\nand wineglasses but bedroom waterbottles, fruit- and sweet-dishes,\r\nwater-jugs, and in the end we made quite a business-like afternoon of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI was beginning now to long quite definitely for events. Energy was\r\naccumulating in me, and worrying me for an outlet. I found the TIMES and\r\nthe DAILY TELEGRAPH and the other papers I managed to get hold of, more\r\nand more stimulating. I nearly wrote to the former paper one day in\r\nanswer to a letter by Lord Grimthorpe--I forget now upon what point.\r\nI chafed secretly against this life of tranquil appreciations more and\r\nmore. I found my attitudes of restrained and delicate affection for\r\nMargaret increasingly difficult to sustain. I surprised myself and her\r\nby little gusts of irritability, gusts like the catspaws before a gale.\r\nI was alarmed at these symptoms.\r\n\r\nOne night when Margaret had gone up to her room, I put on a light\r\novercoat, went out into the night and prowled for a long time through\r\nthe narrow streets, smoking and thinking. I returned and went and sat on\r\nthe edge of her bed to talk to her.\r\n\r\n“Look here, Margaret,” I said; “this is all very well, but I'm\r\nrestless.”\r\n\r\n“Restless!” she said with a faint surprise in her voice.\r\n\r\n“Yes. I think I want exercise. I've got a sort of feeling--I've never\r\nhad it before--as though I was getting fat.”\r\n\r\n“My dear!” she cried.\r\n\r\n“I want to do things;--ride horses, climb mountains, take the devil out\r\nof myself.”\r\n\r\nShe watched me thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“Couldn't we DO something?” she said.\r\n\r\nDo what?\r\n\r\n“I don't know. Couldn't we perhaps go away from here soon--and walk in\r\nthe mountains--on our way home.”\r\n\r\nI thought. “There seems to be no exercise at all in this place.”\r\n\r\n“Isn't there some walk?”\r\n\r\n“I wonder,” I answered. “We might walk to Chioggia perhaps, along\r\nthe Lido.” And we tried that, but the long stretch of beach fatigued\r\nMargaret's back, and gave her blisters, and we never got beyond\r\nMalamocco....\r\n\r\nA day or so after we went out to those pleasant black-robed, bearded\r\nArmenians in their monastery at Saint Lazzaro, and returned towards\r\nsundown. We fell into silence. “PIU LENTO,” said Margaret to the\r\ngondolier, and released my accumulated resolution.\r\n\r\n“Let us go back to London,” I said abruptly.\r\n\r\nMargaret looked at me with surprised blue eyes.\r\n\r\n“This is beautiful beyond measure, you know,” I said, sticking to my\r\npoint, “but I have work to do.”\r\n\r\nShe was silent for some seconds. “I had forgotten,” she said.\r\n\r\n“So had I,” I sympathised, and took her hand. “Suddenly I have\r\nremembered.”\r\n\r\nShe remained quite still. “There is so much to be done,” I said, almost\r\napologetically.\r\n\r\nShe looked long away from me across the lagoon and at last sighed, like\r\none who has drunk deeply, and turned to me.\r\n\r\n“I suppose one ought not to be so happy,” she said. “Everything has been\r\nso beautiful and so simple and splendid. And clean. It has been just\r\nWith You--the time of my life. It's a pity such things must end. But\r\nthe world is calling you, dear.... I ought not to have forgotten it. I\r\nthought you were resting--and thinking. But if you are rested.--Would\r\nyou like us to start to-morrow?”\r\n\r\nShe looked at once so fragile and so devoted that on the spur of the\r\nmoment I relented, and we stayed in Venice four more days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FOURTH ~~ THE HOUSE IN WESTMINSTER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nMargaret had already taken a little house in Radnor Square, Westminster,\r\nbefore our marriage, a house that seemed particularly adaptable to our\r\nneeds as public-spirited efficients; it had been very pleasantly painted\r\nand papered under Margaret's instructions, white paint and clean open\r\npurples and green predominating, and now we set to work at once upon\r\nthe interesting business of arranging and--with our Venetian glass as a\r\nbeginning--furnishing it. We had been fairly fortunate with our wedding\r\npresents, and for the most part it was open to us to choose just exactly\r\nwhat we would have and just precisely where we would put it.\r\n\r\nMargaret had a sense of form and colour altogether superior to mine, and\r\nso quite apart from the fact that it was her money equipped us, I stood\r\naside from all these matters and obeyed her summons to a consultation\r\nonly to endorse her judgment very readily. Until everything was settled\r\nI went every day to my old rooms in Vincent Square and worked at a\r\nseries of papers that were originally intended for the FORTNIGHTLY\r\nREVIEW, the papers that afterwards became my fourth book, “New Aspects\r\nof Liberalism.”\r\n\r\nI still remember as delightful most of the circumstances of getting\r\ninto 79, Radnor Square. The thin flavour of indecision about Margaret\r\ndisappeared altogether in a shop; she had the precisest ideas of what\r\nshe wanted, and the devices of the salesman did not sway her. It was\r\nvery pleasant to find her taking things out of my hands with a certain\r\nmasterfulness, and showing the distinctest determination to make a\r\nhouse in which I should be able to work in that great project of “doing\r\nsomething for the world.”\r\n\r\n“And I do want to make things pretty about us,” she said. “You don't\r\nthink it wrong to have things pretty?”\r\n\r\n“I want them so.”\r\n\r\n“Altiora has things hard.”\r\n\r\n“Altiora,” I answered, “takes a pride in standing ugly and uncomfortable\r\nthings. But I don't see that they help her. Anyhow they won't help me.”\r\n\r\nSo Margaret went to the best shops and got everything very simple and\r\nvery good. She bought some pictures very well indeed; there was a little\r\nSussex landscape, full of wind and sunshine, by Nicholson, for my study,\r\nthat hit my taste far better than if I had gone out to get some such\r\nexpression for myself.\r\n\r\n“We will buy a picture just now and then,” she said, “sometimes--when we\r\nsee one.”\r\n\r\nI would come back through the January mire or fog from Vincent Square to\r\nthe door of 79, and reach it at last with a quite childish appreciation\r\nof the fact that its solid Georgian proportions and its fine brass\r\nfurnishings belonged to MY home; I would use my latchkey and discover\r\nMargaret in the warm-lit, spacious hall with a partially opened\r\npacking-case, fatigued but happy, or go up to have tea with her out\r\nof the right tea things, “come at last,” or be told to notice what was\r\nfresh there. It wasn't simply that I had never had a house before, but\r\nI had really never been, except in the most transitory way, in any house\r\nthat was nearly so delightful as mine promised to be. Everything was\r\nfresh and bright, and softly and harmoniously toned. Downstairs we had\r\na green dining-room with gleaming silver, dark oak, and English\r\ncolour-prints; above was a large drawing-room that could be made still\r\nlarger by throwing open folding doors, and it was all carefully done in\r\ngreys and blues, for the most part with real Sheraton supplemented by\r\nSheraton so skilfully imitated by an expert Margaret had discovered as\r\nto be indistinguishable except to a minute scrutiny. And for me, above\r\nthis and next to my bedroom, there was a roomy study, with specially\r\nthick stair-carpet outside and thick carpets in the bedroom overhead and\r\na big old desk for me to sit at and work between fire and window, and\r\nanother desk specially made for me by that expert if I chose to\r\nstand and write, and open bookshelves and bookcases and every sort of\r\nconvenient fitting. There were electric heaters beside the open fire,\r\nand everything was put for me to make tea at any time--electric kettle,\r\ninfuser, biscuits and fresh butter, so that I could get up and work at\r\nany hour of the day or night. I could do no work in this apartment for\r\na long time, I was so interested in the perfection of its arrangements.\r\nAnd when I brought in my books and papers from Vincent Square, Margaret\r\nseized upon all the really shabby volumes and had them re-bound in a\r\nfine official-looking leather.\r\n\r\nI can remember sitting down at that desk and looking round me and\r\nfeeling with a queer effect of surprise that after all even a place\r\nin the Cabinet, though infinitely remote, was nevertheless in the same\r\nlarge world with these fine and quietly expensive things.\r\n\r\nOn the same floor Margaret had a “den,” a very neat and pretty den with\r\ngood colour-prints of Botticellis and Carpaccios, and there was a third\r\napartment for sectarial purposes should the necessity for them arise,\r\nwith a severe-looking desk equipped with patent files. And Margaret\r\nwould come flitting into the room to me, or appear noiselessly\r\nstanding, a tall gracefully drooping form, in the wide open doorway. “Is\r\neverything right, dear?” she would ask.\r\n\r\n“Come in,” I would say, “I'm sorting out papers.”\r\n\r\nShe would come to the hearthrug.\r\n\r\n“I mustn't disturb you,” she would remark.\r\n\r\n“I'm not busy yet.”\r\n\r\n“Things are getting into order. Then we must make out a time-table as\r\nthe Baileys do, and BEGIN!”\r\n\r\nAltiora came in to see us once or twice, and a number of serious\r\nyoung wives known to Altiora called and were shown over the house, and\r\ndiscussed its arrangements with Margaret. They were all tremendously\r\nkeen on efficient arrangements.\r\n\r\n“A little pretty,” said Altiora, with the faintest disapproval,\r\n“still--”\r\n\r\nIt was clear she thought we should grow out of that. From the day of our\r\nreturn we found other people's houses open to us and eager for us. We\r\nwent out of London for week-ends and dined out, and began discussing\r\nour projects for reciprocating these hospitalities. As a single man\r\nunattached, I had had a wide and miscellaneous social range, but now\r\nI found myself falling into place in a set. For a time I acquiesced\r\nin this. I went very little to my clubs, the Climax and the National\r\nLiberal, and participated in no bachelor dinners at all. For a time,\r\ntoo, I dropped out of the garrulous literary and journalistic circles I\r\nhad frequented. I put up for the Reform, not so much for the use of the\r\nclub as a sign of serious and substantial political standing. I didn't\r\ngo up to Cambridge, I remember, for nearly a year, so occupied was I\r\nwith my new adjustments.\r\n\r\nThe people we found ourselves among at this time were people, to put\r\nit roughly, of the Parliamentary candidate class, or people already\r\nactually placed in the political world. They ranged between very\r\nconsiderable wealth and such a hard, bare independence as old Willersley\r\nand the sister who kept house for him possessed. There were quite\r\na number of young couples like ourselves, a little younger and more\r\nartless, or a little older and more established. Among the younger men\r\nI had a sort of distinction because of my Cambridge reputation and my\r\nwriting, and because, unlike them, I was an adventurer and had won and\r\nmarried my way into their circles instead of being naturally there. They\r\ncouldn't quite reckon upon what I should do; they felt I had reserves of\r\nexperience and incalculable traditions. Close to us were the Cramptons,\r\nWillie Crampton, who has since been Postmaster-General, rich and\r\nvery important in Rockshire, and his younger brother Edward, who has\r\nspecialised in history and become one of those unimaginative men of\r\nletters who are the glory of latter-day England. Then there was Lewis,\r\nfurther towards Kensington, where his cousins the Solomons and the\r\nHartsteins lived, a brilliant representative of his race, able,\r\nindustrious and invariably uninspired, with a wife a little in revolt\r\nagainst the racial tradition of feminine servitude and inclined to the\r\nsuffragette point of view, and Bunting Harblow, an old blue, and with an\r\nerratic disposition well under the control of the able little cousin he\r\nhad married. I had known all these men, but now (with Altiora floating\r\nangelically in benediction) they opened their hearts to me and took\r\nme into their order. They were all like myself, prospective Liberal\r\ncandidates, with a feeling that the period of wandering in the\r\nwilderness of opposition was drawing near its close. They were all\r\ntremendously keen upon social and political service, and all greatly\r\nunder the sway of the ideal of a simple, strenuous life, a life finding\r\nits satisfactions in political achievements and distinctions. The young\r\nwives were as keen about it as the young husbands, Margaret most of\r\nall, and I--whatever elements in me didn't march with the attitudes and\r\nhabits of this set were very much in the background during that time.\r\n\r\nWe would give little dinners and have evening gatherings at which\r\neverything was very simple and very good, with a slight but perceptible\r\nausterity, and there was more good fruit and flowers and less perhaps in\r\nthe way of savouries, patties and entrees than was customary. Sherry we\r\nbanished, and Marsala and liqueurs, and there was always good home-made\r\nlemonade available. No men waited, but very expert parlourmaids. Our\r\nmeat was usually Welsh mutton--I don't know why, unless that mountains\r\nhave ever been the last refuge of the severer virtues. And we talked\r\npolitics and books and ideas and Bernard Shaw (who was a department by\r\nhimself and supposed in those days to be ethically sound at bottom),\r\nand mingled with the intellectuals--I myself was, as it were, a promoted\r\nintellectual.\r\n\r\nThe Cramptons had a tendency to read good things aloud on their less\r\nfrequented receptions, but I have never been able to participate\r\nsubmissively in this hyper-digestion of written matter, and generally\r\nmanaged to provoke a disruptive debate. We were all very earnest to make\r\nthe most of ourselves and to be and do, and I wonder still at times,\r\nwith an unassuaged perplexity, how it is that in that phase of utmost\r\nearnestness I have always seemed to myself to be most remote from\r\nreality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\nI look back now across the detaching intervention of sixteen crowded\r\nyears, critically and I fancy almost impartially, to those beginnings\r\nof my married life. I try to recall something near to their proper order\r\nthe developing phases of relationship. I am struck most of all by the\r\nimmense unpremeditated, generous-spirited insincerities upon which\r\nMargaret and I were building.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that here I have to tell perhaps the commonest experience\r\nof all among married educated people, the deliberate, shy, complex\r\neffort to fill the yawning gaps in temperament as they appear, the\r\nsustained, failing attempt to bridge abysses, level barriers, evade\r\nviolent pressures. I have come these latter years of my life to believe\r\nthat it is possible for a man and woman to be absolutely real with one\r\nanother, to stand naked souled to each other, unashamed and unafraid,\r\nbecause of the natural all-glorifying love between them. It is possible\r\nto love and be loved untroubling, as a bird flies through the air. But\r\nit is a rare and intricate chance that brings two people within sight of\r\nthat essential union, and for the majority marriage must adjust itself\r\non other terms. Most coupled people never really look at one another.\r\nThey look a little away to preconceived ideas. And each from the first\r\ndays of love-making HIDES from the other, is afraid of disappointing,\r\nafraid of offending, afraid of discoveries in either sense. They build\r\nnot solidly upon the rock of truth, but upon arches and pillars and\r\nqueer provisional supports that are needed to make a common foundation,\r\nand below in the imprisoned darknesses, below the fine fabric they\r\nsustain together begins for each of them a cavernous hidden life. Down\r\nthere things may be prowling that scarce ever peep out to consciousness\r\nexcept in the grey half-light of sleepless nights, passions that flash\r\nout for an instant in an angry glance and are seen no more, starved\r\nvictims and beautiful dreams bricked up to die. For the most of us there\r\nis no jail delivery of those inner depths, and the life above goes on to\r\nits honourable end.\r\n\r\nI have told how I loved Margaret and how I came to marry her. Perhaps\r\nalready unintentionally I have indicated the quality of the injustice\r\nour marriage did us both. There was no kindred between us and no\r\nunderstanding. We were drawn to one another by the unlikeness of our\r\nquality, by the things we misunderstood in each other. I know a score of\r\ncouples who have married in that fashion.\r\n\r\nModern conditions and modern ideas, and in particular the intenser and\r\nsubtler perceptions of modern life, press more and more heavily upon a\r\nmarriage tie whose fashion comes from an earlier and less discriminating\r\ntime. When the wife was her husband's subordinate, meeting him simply\r\nand uncritically for simple ends, when marriage was a purely domestic\r\nrelationship, leaving thought and the vivid things of life\r\nalmost entirely to the unencumbered man, mental and temperamental\r\nincompatibilities mattered comparatively little. But now the wife,\r\nand particularly the loving childless wife, unpremeditatedly makes a\r\nrelentless demand for a complete association, and the husband exacts\r\nunthought of delicacies of understanding and co-operation. These are\r\nstupendous demands. People not only think more fully and elaborately\r\nabout life than they ever did before, but marriage obliges us to make\r\nthat ever more accidented progress a three-legged race of carelessly\r\nassorted couples....\r\n\r\nOur very mental texture was different. I was rough-minded, to use the\r\nphrase of William James, primary and intuitive and illogical; she was\r\ntender-minded, logical, refined and secondary. She was loyal to\r\npledge and persons, sentimental and faithful; I am loyal to ideas\r\nand instincts, emotional and scheming. My imagination moves in broad\r\ngestures; her's was delicate with a real dread of extravagance. My\r\nquality is sensuous and ruled by warm impulses; hers was discriminating\r\nand essentially inhibitory. I like the facts of the case and to mention\r\neverything; I like naked bodies and the jolly smells of things. She\r\nabounded in reservations, in circumlocutions and evasions, in keenly\r\nappreciated secondary points. Perhaps the reader knows that Tintoretto\r\nin the National Gallery, the Origin of the Milky Way. It is an admirable\r\ntest of temperamental quality. In spite of my early training I have\r\ncome to regard that picture as altogether delightful; to Margaret it\r\nhas always been “needlessly offensive.” In that you have our fundamental\r\nbreach. She had a habit, by no means rare, of damning what she did not\r\nlike or find sympathetic in me on the score that it was not my “true\r\nself,” and she did not so much accept the universe as select from it and\r\ndo her best to ignore the rest. And also I had far more initiative than\r\nhad she. This is no catalogue of rights and wrongs, or superiorities\r\nand inferiorities; it is a catalogue of differences between two people\r\nlinked in a relationship that constantly becomes more intolerant of\r\ndifferences.\r\n\r\nThis is how we stood to each other, and none of it was clear to either\r\nof us at the outset. To begin with, I found myself reserving myself\r\nfrom her, then slowly apprehending a jarring between our minds and\r\nwhat seemed to me at first a queer little habit of misunderstanding in\r\nher....\r\n\r\nIt did not hinder my being very fond of her....\r\n\r\nWhere our system of reservation became at once most usual and most\r\nastounding was in our personal relations. It is not too much to say that\r\nin that regard we never for a moment achieved sincerity with one another\r\nduring the first six years of our life together. It goes even deeper\r\nthan that, for in my effort to realise the ideal of my marriage I ceased\r\neven to attempt to be sincere with myself. I would not admit my own\r\nperceptions and interpretations. I tried to fit myself to her thinner\r\nand finer determinations. There are people who will say with a note\r\nof approval that I was learning to conquer myself. I record that much\r\nwithout any note of approval....\r\n\r\nFor some years I never deceived Margaret about any concrete fact nor,\r\nexcept for the silence about my earlier life that she had almost forced\r\nupon me, did I hide any concrete fact that seemed to affect her, but\r\nfrom the outset I was guilty of immense spiritual concealments, my very\r\nmarriage was based, I see now, on a spiritual subterfuge; I hid moods\r\nfrom her, pretended feelings....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nThe interest and excitement of setting-up a house, of walking about\r\nit from room to room and from floor to floor, or sitting at one's own\r\ndinner table and watching one's wife control conversation with a pretty,\r\ntimid resolution, of taking a place among the secure and free people of\r\nour world, passed almost insensibly into the interest and excitement\r\nof my Parliamentary candidature for the Kinghamstead Division, that\r\nshapeless chunk of agricultural midland between the Great Western and\r\nthe North Western railways. I was going to “take hold” at last, the\r\nKinghamstead Division was my appointed handle. I was to find my place in\r\nthe rather indistinctly sketched constructions that were implicit in the\r\nminds of all our circle. The precise place I had to fill and the precise\r\nfunctions I had to discharge were not as yet very clear, but all that,\r\nwe felt sure, would become plain as things developed.\r\n\r\nA few brief months of vague activities of “nursing” gave place to\r\nthe excitements of the contest that followed the return of Mr.\r\nCamphell-Bannerman to power in 1905. So far as the Kinghamstead Division\r\nwas concerned it was a depressed and tepid battle. I went about the\r\nconstituency making three speeches that were soon threadbare, and an\r\nodd little collection of people worked for me; two solicitors, a cheap\r\nphotographer, a democratic parson, a number of dissenting ministers, the\r\nMayor of Kinghamstead, a Mrs. Bulger, the widow of an old Chartist who\r\nhad grown rich through electric traction patents, Sir Roderick Newton,\r\na Jew who had bought Calersham Castle, and old Sir Graham Rivers, that\r\nsturdy old soldier, were among my chief supporters. We had headquarters\r\nin each town and village, mostly there were empty shops we leased\r\ntemporarily, and there at least a sort of fuss and a coming and going\r\nwere maintained. The rest of the population stared in a state of\r\nsuspended judgment as we went about the business. The country was\r\nsupposed to be in a state of intellectual conflict and deliberate\r\ndecision, in history it will no doubt figure as a momentous conflict.\r\nYet except for an occasional flare of bill-sticking or a bill in a\r\nwindow or a placard-plastered motor-car or an argumentative group\r\nof people outside a public-house or a sluggish movement towards the\r\nschoolroom or village hall, there was scarcely a sign that a great\r\nempire was revising its destinies. Now and then one saw a canvasser on\r\na doorstep. For the most part people went about their business with an\r\nentirely irresponsible confidence in the stability of the universe. At\r\ntimes one felt a little absurd with one's flutter of colours and one's\r\nair of saving the country.\r\n\r\nMy opponent was a quite undistinguished Major-General who relied upon\r\nhis advocacy of Protection, and was particularly anxious we should avoid\r\n“personalities” and fight the constituency in a gentlemanly spirit. He\r\nwas always writing me notes, apologising for excesses on the part of his\r\nsupporters, or pointing out the undesirability of some course taken by\r\nmine.\r\n\r\nMy speeches had been planned upon broad lines, but they lost touch with\r\nthese as the polling approached. To begin with I made a real attempt\r\nto put what was in my mind before the people I was to supply with\r\na political voice. I spoke of the greatness of our empire and its\r\ndestinies, of the splendid projects and possibilities of life and order\r\nthat lay before the world, of all that a resolute and constructive\r\neffort might do at the present time. “We are building a state,” I said,\r\n“secure and splendid, we are in the dawn of the great age of mankind.”\r\n Sometimes that would get a solitary “'Ear! 'ear!” Then having created,\r\nas I imagined, a fine atmosphere, I turned upon the history of the last\r\nConservative administration and brought it into contrast with the wide\r\noccasions of the age; discussed its failure to control the grasping\r\nfinanciers in South Africa, its failure to release public education from\r\nsectarian squabbles, its misconduct of the Boer War, its waste of the\r\nworld's resources....\r\n\r\nIt soon became manifest that my opening and my general spaciousness of\r\nmethod bored my audiences a good deal. The richer and wider my phrases\r\nthe thinner sounded my voice in these non-resonating gatherings. Even\r\nthe platform supporters grew restive unconsciously, and stirred and\r\ncoughed. They did not recognise themselves as mankind. Building an\r\nempire, preparing a fresh stage in the history of humanity, had no\r\nappeal for them. They were mostly everyday, toiling people, full of\r\nsmall personal solicitudes, and they came to my meetings, I think, very\r\nlargely as a relaxation. This stuff was not relaxing. They did not think\r\npolitics was a great constructive process, they thought it was a kind\r\nof dog-fight. They wanted fun, they wanted spice, they wanted hits,\r\nthey wanted also a chance to say “'Ear', 'ear!” in an intelligent and\r\nhonourable manner and clap their hands and drum with their feet. The\r\ngreat constructive process in history gives so little scope for clapping\r\nand drumming and saying “'Ear, 'ear!” One might as well think of\r\nhounding on the solar system.\r\n\r\nSo after one or two attempts to lift my audiences to the level of the\r\nissues involved, I began to adapt myself to them. I cut down my review\r\nof our imperial outlook and destinies more and more, and\r\ndeveloped a series of hits and anecdotes and--what shall I call\r\nthem?--“crudifications” of the issue. My helper's congratulated me on\r\nthe rapid improvement of my platform style. I ceased to speak of the\r\nlate Prime Minister with the respect I bore him, and began to fall in\r\nwith the popular caricature of him as an artful rabbit-witted person\r\nintent only on keeping his leadership, in spite of the vigorous attempts\r\nof Mr. Joseph Chamberlain to oust him therefrom. I ceased to qualify my\r\nstatement that Protection would make food dearer for the agricultural\r\nlabourer. I began to speak of Mr. Alfred Lyttelton as an influence at\r\nonce insane and diabolical, as a man inspired by a passionate desire\r\nto substitute manacled but still criminal Chinese for honest British\r\nlabourers throughout the world. And when it came to the mention of our\r\nown kindly leader, of Mr. John Burns or any one else of any prominence\r\nat all on our side I fell more and more into the intonation of one who\r\nmentions the high gods. And I had my reward in brighter meetings and\r\nreadier and readier applause.\r\n\r\nOne goes on from phase to phase in these things.\r\n\r\n“After all,” I told myself, “if one wants to get to Westminster one must\r\nfollow the road that leads there,” but I found the road nevertheless\r\nrather unexpectedly distasteful. “When one gets there,” I said, “then it\r\nis one begins.”\r\n\r\nBut I would lie awake at nights with that sore throat and headache and\r\nfatigue which come from speaking in ill-ventilated rooms, and wondering\r\nhow far it was possible to educate a whole people to great political\r\nideals. Why should political work always rot down to personalities and\r\npersonal appeals in this way? Life is, I suppose, to begin with and\r\nend with a matter of personalities, from personalities all our broader\r\ninterests arise and to personalities they return. All our social and\r\npolitical effort, all of it, is like trying to make a crowd of people\r\nfall into formation. The broader lines appear, but then come a rush\r\nand excitement and irrelevancy, and forthwith the incipient order has\r\nvanished and the marshals must begin the work over again!\r\n\r\nMy memory of all that time is essentially confusion. There was a\r\nfrightful lot of tiresome locomotion in it; for the Kinghamstead\r\nDivision is extensive, abounding in ill-graded and badly metalled\r\ncross-roads and vicious little hills, and singularly unpleasing to\r\nthe eye in a muddy winter. It is sufficiently near to London to\r\nhave undergone the same process of ill-regulated expansion that made\r\nBromstead the place it is. Several of its overgrown villages have\r\ndeveloped strings of factories and sidings along the railway lines, and\r\nthere is an abundance of petty villas. There seemed to be no place\r\nat which one could take hold of more than this or that element of the\r\npopulation. Now we met in a meeting-house, now in a Masonic Hall or\r\nDrill Hall; I also did a certain amount of open-air speaking in the\r\ndinner hour outside gas-works and groups of factories. Some special sort\r\nof people was, as it were, secreted in response to each special appeal.\r\nOne said things carefully adjusted to the distinctive limitations of\r\neach gathering. Jokes of an incredible silliness and shallowness drifted\r\nabout us. Our advisers made us declare that if we were elected we would\r\nlive in the district, and one hasty agent had bills printed, “If Mr.\r\nRemington is elected he will live here.” The enemy obtained a number\r\nof these bills and stuck them on outhouses, pigstyes, dog-kennels; you\r\ncannot imagine how irksome the repetition of that jest became. The vast\r\ndrifting indifference in between my meetings impressed me more and more.\r\nI realised the vagueness of my own plans as I had never done before\r\nI brought them to the test of this experience. I was perplexed by the\r\nriddle of just how far I was, in any sense of the word, taking hold at\r\nall, how far I wasn't myself flowing into an accepted groove.\r\n\r\nMargaret was troubled by no such doubts. She was clear I had to go into\r\nParliament on the side of Liberalism and the light, as against the late\r\nGovernment and darkness. Essential to the memory of my first contest, is\r\nthe memory of her clear bright face, very resolute and grave, helping me\r\nconsciously, steadfastly, with all her strength. Her quiet confidence,\r\nwhile I was so dissatisfied, worked curiously towards the alienation\r\nof my sympathies. I felt she had no business to be so sure of me. I had\r\nmoments of vivid resentment at being thus marched towards Parliament.\r\n\r\nI seemed now always to be discovering alien forces of character in\r\nher. Her way of taking life diverged from me more and more. She sounded\r\namazing, independent notes. She bought some particularly costly furs for\r\nthe campaign that roused enthusiasm whenever she appeared. She also made\r\nme a birthday present in November of a heavily fur-trimmed coat and this\r\nshe would make me remove as I went on to the platform, and hold over her\r\narm until I was ready to resume it. It was fearfully heavy for her and\r\nshe liked it to be heavy for her. That act of servitude was in essence\r\na towering self-assertion. I would glance sideways while some chairman\r\nfloundered through his introduction and see the clear blue eye with\r\nwhich she regarded the audience, which existed so far as she was\r\nconcerned merely to return me to Parliament. It was a friendly eye,\r\nprovided they were not silly or troublesome. But it kindled a little at\r\nthe hint of a hostile question. After we had come so far and taken so\r\nmuch trouble!\r\n\r\nShe constituted herself the dragoman of our political travels. In hotels\r\nshe was serenely resolute for the quietest and the best, she rejected\r\nall their proposals for meals and substituted a severely nourishing\r\ndietary of her own, and even in private houses she astonished me by her\r\ntranquil insistence upon special comforts and sustenance. I can see her\r\nface now as it would confront a hostess, a little intent, but sweetly\r\nresolute and assured.\r\n\r\nSince our marriage she had read a number of political memoirs, and she\r\nhad been particularly impressed by the career of Mrs. Gladstone. I don't\r\nthink it occurred to her to compare and contrast my quality with that\r\nof Mrs. Gladstone's husband. I suspect her of a deliberate intention\r\nof achieving parallel results by parallel methods. I was to be\r\nGladstonised. Gladstone it appeared used to lubricate his speeches with\r\na mixture--if my memory serves me right--of egg beaten up in sherry,\r\nand Margaret was very anxious I should take a leaf from that celebrated\r\nbook. She wanted, I know, to hold the glass in her hand while I was\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\nBut here I was firm. “No,” I said, very decisively, “simply I won't\r\nstand that. It's a matter of conscience. I shouldn't feel--democratic.\r\nI'll take my chance of the common water in the carafe on the chairman's\r\ntable.”\r\n\r\n“I DO wish you wouldn't,” she said, distressed.\r\n\r\nIt was absurd to feel irritated; it was so admirable of her, a little\r\nchildish, infinitely womanly and devoted and fine--and I see now how\r\npathetic. But I could not afford to succumb to her. I wanted to follow\r\nmy own leading, to see things clearly, and this reassuring pose of a\r\nhigh destiny, of an almost terribly efficient pursuit of a fixed end\r\nwhen as a matter of fact I had a very doubtful end and an aim as yet by\r\nno means fixed, was all too seductive for dalliance....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd into all these things with the manner of a trifling and casual\r\nincident comes the figure of Isabel Rivers. My first impressions of\r\nher were of a rather ugly and ungainly, extraordinarily interesting\r\nschoolgirl with a beautiful quick flush under her warm brown skin, who\r\nsaid and did amusing and surprising things. When first I saw her she\r\nwas riding a very old bicycle downhill with her feet on the fork of the\r\nframe--it seemed to me to the public danger, but afterwards I came to\r\nunderstand the quality of her nerve better--and on the third occasion\r\nshe was for her own private satisfaction climbing a tree. On the\r\nintervening occasion we had what seems now to have been a long sustained\r\nconversation about the political situation and the books and papers I\r\nhad written.\r\n\r\nI wonder if it was.\r\n\r\nWhat a delightful mixture of child and grave woman she was at that time,\r\nand how little I reckoned on the part she would play in my life! And\r\nsince she has played that part, how impossible it is to tell now of\r\nthose early days! Since I wrote that opening paragraph to this section\r\nmy idle pen has been, as it were, playing by itself and sketching faces\r\non the blotting pad--one impish wizened visage is oddly like little\r\nBailey--and I have been thinking cheek on fist amidst a limitless wealth\r\nof memories. She sits below me on the low wall under the olive trees\r\nwith our little child in her arms. She is now the central fact in my\r\nlife. It still seems a little incredible that that should be so. She has\r\ndestroyed me as a politician, brought me to this belated rebeginning of\r\nlife. When I sit down and try to make her a girl again, I feel like the\r\nArabian fisherman who tried to put the genius back into the pot from\r\nwhich it had spread gigantic across the skies....\r\n\r\nI have a very clear vision of her rush downhill past our\r\nlabouring ascendant car--my colours fluttered from handle-bar and\r\nshoulder-knot--and her waving hand and the sharp note of her voice. She\r\ncried out something, I don't know what, some greeting.\r\n\r\n“What a pretty girl!” said Margaret.\r\n\r\nParvill, the cheap photographer, that industrious organiser for whom\r\nby way of repayment I got those magic letters, that knighthood of the\r\nunderlings, “J. P.” was in the car with us and explained her to us. “One\r\nof the best workers you have,” he said....\r\n\r\nAnd then after a toilsome troubled morning we came, rather cross from\r\nthe strain of sustained amiability, to Sir Graham Rivers' house. It\r\nseemed all softness and quiet--I recall dead white panelling and\r\noval mirrors horizontally set and a marble fireplace between white\r\nmarble-blind Homer and marble-blind Virgil, very grave and fine--and how\r\nIsabel came in to lunch in a shapeless thing like a blue smock that\r\nmade her bright quick-changing face seem yellow under her cloud of black\r\nhair. Her step-sister was there, Miss Gamer, to whom the house was\r\nto descend, a well-dressed lady of thirty, amiably disavowing\r\nresponsibility for Isabel in every phrase and gesture. And there was a\r\nvery pleasant doctor, an Oxford man, who seemed on excellent terms with\r\nevery one. It was manifest that he was in the habit of sparring with the\r\ngirl, but on this occasion she wasn't sparring and refused to be teased\r\ninto a display in spite of the taunts of either him or her father. She\r\nwas, they discovered with rising eyebrows, shy. It seemed an opportunity\r\ntoo rare for them to miss. They proclaimed her enthusiasm for me in a\r\nway that brought a flush to her cheek and a look into her eye between\r\nappeal and defiance. They declared she had read my books, which I\r\nthought at the time was exaggeration, their dry political quality was so\r\ndistinctly not what one was accustomed to regard as schoolgirl reading.\r\nMiss Gamer protested to protect her, “When once in a blue moon Isabel is\r\nwell-behaved....!”\r\n\r\nExcept for these attacks I do not remember much of the conversation\r\nat table; it was, I know, discursive and concerned with the sort of\r\ntopographical and social and electioneering fact natural to such a\r\nvisit. Old Rivers struck me as a delightful person, modestly unconscious\r\nof his doubly-earned V. C. and the plucky defence of Kardin-Bergat that\r\nwon his baronetcy. He was that excellent type, the soldier radical, and\r\nwe began that day a friendship that was only ended by his death in the\r\nhunting-field three years later. He interested Margaret into a disregard\r\nof my plate and the fact that I had secured the illegal indulgence of\r\nMoselle. After lunch we went for coffee into another low room, this\r\ntime brown panelled and looking through French windows on a red-walled\r\ngarden, graceful even in its winter desolation. And there the\r\nconversation suddenly picked up and became good. It had fallen to a\r\npause, and the doctor, with an air of definitely throwing off a mask\r\nand wrecking an established tranquillity, remarked: “Very probably you\r\nLiberals will come in, though I'm not sure you'll come in so mightily as\r\nyou think, but what you do when you do come in passes my comprehension.”\r\n\r\n“There's good work sometimes,” said Sir Graham, “in undoing.”\r\n\r\n“You can't govern a great empire by amending and repealing the Acts of\r\nyour predecessors,” said the doctor.\r\n\r\nThere came that kind of pause that happens when a subject is broached\r\ntoo big and difficult for the gathering. Margaret's blue eyes regarded\r\nthe speaker with quiet disapproval for a moment, and then came to me in\r\nthe not too confident hope that I would snub him out of existence with\r\nsome prompt rhetorical stroke. A voice spoke out of the big armchair.\r\n\r\n“We'll do things,” said Isabel.\r\n\r\nThe doctor's eye lit with the joy of the fisherman who strikes his fish\r\nat last. “What will you do?” he asked her.\r\n\r\n“Every one knows we're a mixed lot,” said Isabel.\r\n\r\n“Poor old chaps like me!” interjected the general.\r\n\r\n“But that's not a programme,” said the doctor.\r\n\r\n“But Mr. Remington has published a programme,” said Isabel.\r\n\r\nThe doctor cocked half an eye at me.\r\n\r\n“In some review,” the girl went on. “After all, we're not going to\r\nelect the whole Liberal party in the Kinghamstead Division. I'm a\r\nRemington-ite!”\r\n\r\n“But the programme,” said the doctor, “the programme--”\r\n\r\n“In front of Mr. Remington!”\r\n\r\n“Scandal always comes home at last,” said the doctor. “Let him hear the\r\nworst.”\r\n\r\n“I'd like to hear,” I said. “Electioneering shatters convictions and\r\nenfeebles the mind.”\r\n\r\n“Not mine,” said Isabel stoutly. “I mean--Well, anyhow I take it Mr.\r\nRemington stands for constructing a civilised state out of this muddle.”\r\n\r\n“THIS muddle,” protested the doctor with an appeal of the eye to the\r\nbeautiful long room and the ordered garden outside the bright clean\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\n“Well, THAT muddle, if you like! There's a slum within a mile of us\r\nalready. The dust and blacks get worse and worse, Sissie?”\r\n\r\n“They do,” agreed Miss Gamer.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Remington stands for construction, order, education, discipline.”\r\n\r\n“And you?” said the doctor.\r\n\r\n“I'm a good Remington-ite.”\r\n\r\n“Discipline!” said the doctor.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Isabel. “At times one has to be--Napoleonic. They want to\r\nlibel me, Mr. Remington. A political worker can't always be in time for\r\nmeals, can she? At times one has to make--splendid cuts.”\r\n\r\nMiss Gamer said something indistinctly.\r\n\r\n“Order, education, discipline,” said Sir Graham. “Excellent things!\r\nBut I've a sort of memory--in my young days--we talked about something\r\ncalled liberty.”\r\n\r\n“Liberty under the law,” I said, with an unexpected approving murmur\r\nfrom Margaret, and took up the defence. “The old Liberal definition of\r\nliberty was a trifle uncritical. Privilege and legal restrictions are\r\nnot the only enemies of liberty. An uneducated, underbred, and underfed\r\npropertyless man is a man who has lost the possibility of liberty.\r\nThere's no liberty worth a rap for him. A man who is swimming hopelessly\r\nfor life wants nothing but the liberty to get out of the water; he'll\r\ngive every other liberty for it--until he gets out.”\r\n\r\nSir Graham took me up and we fell into a discussion of the\r\nchanging qualities of Liberalism. It was a good give-and-take talk,\r\nextraordinarily refreshing after the nonsense and crowding secondary\r\nissues of the electioneering outside. We all contributed more or less\r\nexcept Miss Gamer; Margaret followed with knitted brows and occasional\r\ninterjections. “People won't SEE that,” for example, and “It all seems\r\nso plain to me.” The doctor showed himself clever but unsubstantial and\r\ninconsistent. Isabel sat back with her black mop of hair buried deep in\r\nthe chair looking quickly from face to face. Her colour came and went\r\nwith her vivid intellectual excitement; occasionally she would dart\r\na word, usually a very apt word, like a lizard's tongue into the\r\ndiscussion. I remember chiefly that a chance illustration betrayed that\r\nshe had read Bishop Burnet....\r\n\r\nAfter that it was not surprising that Isabel should ask for a lift in\r\nour car as far as the Lurky Committee Room, and that she should offer\r\nme quite sound advice EN ROUTE upon the intellectual temperament of the\r\nLurky gasworkers.\r\n\r\nOn the third occasion that I saw Isabel she was, as I have said,\r\nclimbing a tree--and a very creditable tree--for her own private\r\nsatisfaction. It was a lapse from the high seriousness of politics, and\r\nI perceived she felt that I might regard it as such and attach too much\r\nimportance to it. I had some difficulty in reassuring her. And it's odd\r\nto note now--it has never occurred to me before--that from that day to\r\nthis I do not think I have ever reminded Isabel of that encounter.\r\n\r\nAnd after that memory she seems to be flickering about always in the\r\nelection, an inextinguishable flame; now she flew by on her bicycle,\r\nnow she dashed into committee rooms, now she appeared on doorsteps in\r\nanimated conversation with dubious voters; I took every chance I could\r\nto talk to her--I had never met anything like her before in the world,\r\nand she interested me immensely--and before the polling day she and I\r\nhad become, in the frankest simplicity, fast friends....\r\n\r\nThat, I think, sets out very fairly the facts of our early relationship.\r\nBut it is hard to get it true, either in form or texture, because of\r\nthe bright, translucent, coloured, and refracting memories that come\r\nbetween. One forgets not only the tint and quality of thoughts and\r\nimpressions through that intervening haze, one forgets them altogether.\r\nI don't remember now that I ever thought in those days of passionate\r\nlove or the possibility of such love between us. I may have done so\r\nagain and again. But I doubt it very strongly. I don't think I ever\r\nthought of such aspects. I had no more sense of any danger between us,\r\nseeing the years and things that separated us, than I could have had if\r\nshe had been an intelligent bright-eyed bird. Isabel came into my\r\nlife as a new sort of thing; she didn't join on at all to my previous\r\nexperiences of womanhood. They were not, as I have laboured to explain,\r\neither very wide or very penetrating experiences, on the whole,\r\n“strangled dinginess” expresses them, but I do not believe they were\r\nnarrower or shallower than those of many other men of my class. I\r\nthought of women as pretty things and beautiful things, pretty rather\r\nthan beautiful, attractive and at times disconcertingly attractive,\r\noften bright and witty, but, because of the vast reservations that hid\r\nthem from me, wanting, subtly and inevitably wanting, in understanding.\r\nMy idealisation of Margaret had evaporated insensibly after our\r\nmarriage. The shrine I had made for her in my private thoughts stood\r\nat last undisguisedly empty. But Isabel did not for a moment admit of\r\neither idealisation or interested contempt. She opened a new sphere\r\nof womanhood to me. With her steady amber-brown eyes, her unaffected\r\ninterest in impersonal things, her upstanding waistless blue body, her\r\nenergy, decision and courage, she seemed rather some new and infinitely\r\nfiner form of boyhood than a feminine creature, as I had come to measure\r\nfemininity. She was my perfect friend. Could I have foreseen, had my\r\nworld been more wisely planned, to this day we might have been such\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nShe seemed at that time unconscious of sex, though she has told me since\r\nhow full she was of protesting curiosities and restrained emotions. She\r\nspoke, as indeed she has always spoken, simply, clearly, and vividly;\r\nschoolgirl slang mingled with words that marked ample voracious reading,\r\nand she moved quickly with the free directness of some graceful young\r\nanimal. She took many of the easy freedoms a man or a sister might have\r\ndone with me. She would touch my arm, lay a hand on my shoulder as I\r\nsat, adjust the lapel of a breast-pocket as she talked to me. She says\r\nnow she loved me always from the beginning. I doubt if there was a\r\nsuspicion of that in her mind those days. I used to find her regarding\r\nme with the clearest, steadiest gaze in the world, exactly like the gaze\r\nof some nice healthy innocent animal in a forest, interested, inquiring,\r\nspeculative, but singularly untroubled....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\nPolling day came after a last hoarse and dingy crescendo. The excitement\r\nwas not of the sort that makes one forget one is tired out. The waiting\r\nfor the end of the count has left a long blank mark on my memory, and\r\nthen everyone was shaking my hand and repeating: “Nine hundred and\r\nseventy-six.”\r\n\r\nMy success had been a foregone conclusion since the afternoon, but\r\nwe all behaved as though we had not been anticipating this result for\r\nhours, as though any other figures but nine hundred and seventy-six\r\nwould have meant something entirely different. “Nine hundred and\r\nseventy-six!” said Margaret. “They didn't expect three hundred.”\r\n\r\n“Nine hundred and seventy-six,” said a little short man with a paper.\r\n“It means a big turnover. Two dozen short of a thousand, you know.”\r\n\r\nA tremendous hullaboo began outside, and a lot of fresh people came into\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nIsabel, flushed but not out of breath, Heaven knows where she had sprung\r\nfrom at that time of night! was running her hand down my sleeve almost\r\ncaressingly, with the innocent bold affection of a girl. “Got you in!”\r\n she said. “It's been no end of a lark.”\r\n\r\n“And now,” said I, “I must go and be constructive.”\r\n\r\n“Now you must go and be constructive,” she said.\r\n\r\n“You've got to live here,” she added.\r\n\r\n“By Jove! yes,” I said. “We'll have to house hunt.”\r\n\r\n“I shall read all your speeches.”\r\n\r\nShe hesitated.\r\n\r\n“I wish I was you,” she said, and said it as though it was not exactly\r\nthe thing she was meaning to say.\r\n\r\n“They want you to speak,” said Margaret, with something unsaid in her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n“You must come out with me,” I answered, putting my arm through hers,\r\nand felt someone urging me to the French windows that gave on the\r\nbalcony.\r\n\r\n“If you think--” she said, yielding gladly\r\n\r\n“Oh, RATHER!” said I.\r\n\r\nThe Mayor of Kinghamstead, a managing little man with no great belief in\r\nmy oratorical powers, was sticking his face up to mine.\r\n\r\n“It's all over,” he said, “and you've won. Say all the nice things you\r\ncan and say them plainly.”\r\n\r\nI turned and handed Margaret out through the window and stood looking\r\nover the Market-place, which was more than half filled with swaying\r\npeople. The crowd set up a roar of approval at the sight of us, tempered\r\nby a little booing. Down in one corner of the square a fight was going\r\non for a flag, a fight that even the prospect of a speech could not\r\ninstantly check. “Speech!” cried voices, “Speech!” and then a brief\r\n“boo-oo-oo” that was drowned in a cascade of shouts and cheers. The\r\nconflict round the flag culminated in the smashing of a pane of glass in\r\nthe chemist's window and instantly sank to peace.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen voters of the Kinghamstead Division,” I began.\r\n\r\n“Votes for Women!” yelled a voice, amidst laughter--the first time I\r\nremember hearing that memorable war-cry.\r\n\r\n“Three cheers for Mrs. Remington!”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Remington asks me to thank you,” I said, amidst further uproar and\r\nreiterated cries of “Speech!”\r\n\r\nThen silence came with a startling swiftness.\r\n\r\nIsabel was still in my mind, I suppose. “I shall go to Westminster,” I\r\nbegan. I sought for some compelling phrase and could not find one.\r\n“To do my share,” I went on, “in building up a great and splendid\r\ncivilisation.”\r\n\r\nI paused, and there was a weak gust of cheering, and then a renewal of\r\nbooing.\r\n\r\n“This election,” I said, “has been the end and the beginning of much.\r\nNew ideas are abroad--”\r\n\r\n“Chinese labour,” yelled a voice, and across the square swept a wildfire\r\nof booting and bawling.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the few occasions when I quite lost my hold on a speech. I\r\nglanced sideways and saw the Mayor of Kinghamstead speaking behind his\r\nhand to Parvill. By a happy chance Parvill caught my eye.\r\n\r\n“What do they want?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Eh?”\r\n\r\n“What do they want?”\r\n\r\n“Say something about general fairness--the other side,” prompted\r\nParvill, flattered but a little surprised by my appeal. I pulled myself\r\nhastily into a more popular strain with a gross eulogy of my opponent's\r\ngood taste.\r\n\r\n“Chinese labour!” cried the voice again.\r\n\r\n“You've given that notice to quit,” I answered.\r\n\r\nThe Market-place roared delight, but whether that delight expressed\r\nhostility to Chinamen or hostility to their practical enslavement no\r\nstudent of the General Election of 1906 has ever been able to determine.\r\nCertainly one of the most effective posters on our side displayed a\r\nhideous yellow face, just that and nothing more. There was not even a\r\nlegend to it. How it impressed the electorate we did not know, but that\r\nit impressed the electorate profoundly there can be no disputing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\r\nKinghamstead was one of the earliest constituencies fought, and we came\r\nback--it must have been Saturday--triumphant but very tired, to our\r\nhouse in Radnor Square. In the train we read the first intimations that\r\nthe victory of our party was likely to be a sweeping one.\r\n\r\nThen came a period when one was going about receiving and giving\r\ncongratulations and watching the other men arrive, very like a boy who\r\nhas returned to school with the first batch after the holidays. The\r\nLondon world reeked with the General Election; it had invaded the\r\nnurseries. All the children of one's friends had got big maps of England\r\ncut up into squares to represent constituencies and were busy sticking\r\ngummed blue labels over the conquered red of Unionism that had hitherto\r\nsubmerged the country. And there were also orange labels, if I remember\r\nrightly, to represent the new Labour party, and green for the Irish. I\r\nengaged myself to speak at one or two London meetings, and lunched\r\nat the Reform, which was fairly tepid, and dined and spent one or two\r\ntumultuous evenings at the National Liberal Club, which was in active\r\neruption. The National Liberal became feverishly congested towards\r\nmidnight as the results of the counting came dropping in. A big\r\ngreen-baize screen had been fixed up at one end of the large\r\nsmoking-room with the names of the constituencies that were voting that\r\nday, and directly the figures came to hand, up they went, amidst cheers\r\nthat at last lost their energy through sheer repetition, whenever there\r\nwas record of a Liberal gain. I don't remember what happened when there\r\nwas a Liberal loss; I don't think that any were announced while I was\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nHow packed and noisy the place was, and what a reek of tobacco and\r\nwhisky fumes we made! Everybody was excited and talking, making waves of\r\nharsh confused sound that beat upon one's ears, and every now and then\r\nhoarse voices would shout for someone to speak. Our little set was much\r\nin evidence. Both the Cramptons were in, Lewis, Bunting Harblow. We gave\r\nbrief addresses attuned to this excitement and the late hour, amidst\r\nmuch enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n“Now we can DO things!” I said amidst a rapture of applause. Men I did\r\nnot know from Adam held up glasses and nodded to me in solemn fuddled\r\napproval as I came down past them into the crowd again.\r\n\r\nMen were betting whether the Unionists would lose more or less than two\r\nhundred seats.\r\n\r\n“I wonder just what we shall do with it all,” I heard one sceptic\r\nspeculating....\r\n\r\nAfter these orgies I would get home very tired and excited, and find it\r\ndifficult to get to sleep. I would lie and speculate about what it was\r\nwe WERE going to do. One hadn't anticipated quite such a tremendous\r\naccession to power for one's party. Liberalism was swirling in like a\r\nflood....\r\n\r\nI found the next few weeks very unsatisfactory and distressing. I don't\r\nclearly remember what it was I had expected; I suppose the fuss and\r\nstrain of the General Election had built up a feeling that my return\r\nwould in some way put power into my hands, and instead I found myself\r\na mere undistinguished unit in a vast but rather vague majority. There\r\nwere moments when I felt very distinctly that a majority could be\r\ntoo big a crowd altogether. I had all my work still before me, I had\r\nachieved nothing as yet but opportunity, and a very crowded opportunity\r\nit was at that. Everyone about me was chatting Parliament and\r\nappointments; one breathed distracting and irritating speculations as\r\nto what would be done and who would be asked to do it. I was chiefly\r\nimpressed by what was unlikely to be done and by the absence of any\r\ngeneral plan of legislation to hold us all together. I found the talk\r\nabout Parliamentary procedure and etiquette particularly trying. We\r\ndined with the elder Cramptons one evening, and old Sir Edward was\r\nlengthily sage about what the House liked, what it didn't like, what\r\nmade a good impression and what a bad one. “A man shouldn't speak more\r\nthan twice in his first session, and not at first on too contentious a\r\ntopic,” said Sir Edward. “No.”\r\n\r\n“Very much depends on manner. The House hates a lecturer. There's a sort\r\nof airy earnestness--”\r\n\r\nHe waved his cigar to eke out his words.\r\n\r\n“Little peculiarities of costume count for a great deal. I could name\r\none man who spent three years living down a pair of spatterdashers. On\r\nthe other hand--a thing like that--if it catches the eye of the PUNCH\r\nman, for example, may be your making.”\r\n\r\nHe went off into a lengthy speculation of why the House had come to like\r\nan originally unpopular Irishman named Biggar....\r\n\r\nThe opening of Parliament gave me some peculiar moods. I began to feel\r\nmore and more like a branded sheep. We were sworn in in batches,\r\ndozens and scores of fresh men, trying not to look too fresh under the\r\ninspection of policemen and messengers, all of us carrying new silk hats\r\nand wearing magisterial coats. It is one of my vivid memories from this\r\nperiod, the sudden outbreak of silk hats in the smoking-room of the\r\nNational Liberal Club. At first I thought there must have been a\r\nfuneral. Familiar faces that one had grown to know under soft felt hats,\r\nunder bowlers, under liberal-minded wide brims, and above artistic ties\r\nand tweed jackets, suddenly met one, staring with the stern gaze of\r\nself-consciousness, from under silk hats of incredible glossiness. There\r\nwas a disposition to wear the hat much too forward, I thought, for a\r\ngood Parliamentary style.\r\n\r\nThere was much play with the hats all through; a tremendous competition\r\nto get in first and put hats on coveted seats. A memory hangs about me\r\nof the House in the early afternoon, an inhumane desolation inhabited\r\nalmost entirely by silk hats. The current use of cards to secure seats\r\ncame later. There were yards and yards of empty green benches with hats\r\nand hats and hats distributed along them, resolute-looking top hats, lax\r\ntop hats with a kind of shadowy grin under them, sensible top bats brim\r\nupward, and one scandalous incontinent that had rolled from the front\r\nOpposition bench right to the middle of the floor. A headless hat is\r\nsurely the most soulless thing in the world, far worse even than a\r\nskull....\r\n\r\nAt last, in a leisurely muddled manner we got to the Address; and\r\nI found myself packed in a dense elbowing crowd to the right of the\r\nSpeaker's chair; while the attenuated Opposition, nearly leaderless\r\nafter the massacre, tilted its brim to its nose and sprawled at its ease\r\namidst its empty benches.\r\n\r\nThere was a tremendous hullaboo about something, and I craned to see\r\nover the shoulder of the man in front. “Order, order, order!”\r\n\r\n“What's it about?” I asked.\r\n\r\nThe man in front of me was clearly no better informed, and then I\r\ngathered from a slightly contemptuous Scotchman beside me that it was\r\nChris Robinson had walked between the honourable member in possession\r\nof the house and the Speaker. I caught a glimpse of him blushingly\r\nwhispering about his misadventure to a colleague. He was just that\r\nsame little figure I had once assisted to entertain at Cambridge, but\r\ngrey-haired now, and still it seemed with the same knitted muffler\r\nhe had discarded for a reckless half-hour while he talked to us in\r\nHatherleigh's rooms.\r\n\r\nIt dawned upon me that I wasn't particularly wanted in the House, and\r\nthat I should get all I needed of the opening speeches next day from the\r\nTIMES.\r\n\r\nI made my way out and was presently walking rather aimlessly through the\r\nouter lobby.\r\n\r\nI caught myself regarding the shadow that spread itself out before me,\r\nmultiplied itself in blue tints of various intensity, shuffled itself\r\nlike a pack of cards under the many lights, the square shoulders, the\r\nsilk hat, already worn with a parliamentary tilt backward; I found I was\r\nsurveying this statesmanlike outline with a weak approval. “A MEMBER!”\r\n I felt the little cluster of people that were scattered about the lobby\r\nmust be saying.\r\n\r\n“Good God!” I said in hot reaction, “what am I doing here?”\r\n\r\nIt was one of those moments infinitely trivial in themselves, that yet\r\nare cardinal in a man's life. It came to me with extreme vividness that\r\nit wasn't so much that I had got hold of something as that something\r\nhad got hold of me. I distinctly recall the rebound of my mind. Whatever\r\nhappened in this Parliament, I at least would attempt something. “By\r\nGod!” I said, “I won't be overwhelmed. I am here to do something, and do\r\nsomething I will!”\r\n\r\nBut I felt that for the moment I could not remain in the House.\r\n\r\nI went out by myself with my thoughts into the night. It was a chilling\r\nnight, and rare spots of rain were falling. I glanced over my shoulder\r\nat the lit windows of the Lords. I walked, I remember, westward, and\r\npresently came to the Grosvenar Embankment and followed it, watching the\r\nglittering black rush of the river and the dark, dimly lit barges round\r\nwhich the water swirled. Across the river was the hunched sky-line of\r\nDoulton's potteries, and a kiln flared redly. Dimly luminous trams were\r\ngliding amidst a dotted line of lamps, and two little trains crawled\r\ninto Waterloo station. Mysterious black figures came by me and were\r\nsuddenly changed to the commonplace at the touch of the nearer lamps. It\r\nwas a big confused world, I felt, for a man to lay his hands upon.\r\n\r\nI remember I crossed Vauxhall Bridge and stood for a time watching the\r\nhuge black shapes in the darkness under the gas-works. A shoal of coal\r\nbarges lay indistinctly on the darkly shining mud and water below, and\r\na colossal crane was perpetually hauling up coal into mysterious\r\nblacknesses above, and dropping the empty clutch back to the barges.\r\nJust one or two minute black featureless figures of men toiled amidst\r\nthese monster shapes. They did not seem to be controlling them but only\r\nmoving about among them. These gas-works have a big chimney that belches\r\na lurid flame into the night, a livid shivering bluish flame, shot with\r\nstrange crimson streaks....\r\n\r\nOn the other side of Lambeth Bridge broad stairs go down to the lapping\r\nwater of the river; the lower steps are luminous under the lamps and\r\none treads unwarned into thick soft Thames mud. They seem to be purely\r\narchitectural steps, they lead nowhere, they have an air of absolute\r\nindifference to mortal ends.\r\n\r\nThose shapes and large inhuman places--for all of mankind that one\r\nsees at night about Lambeth is minute and pitiful beside the industrial\r\nmonsters that snort and toil there--mix up inextricably with my memories\r\nof my first days as a legislator. Black figures drift by me, heavy vans\r\nclatter, a newspaper rough tears by on a motor bicycle, and presently,\r\non the Albert Embankment, every seat has its one or two outcasts huddled\r\ntogether and slumbering.\r\n\r\n“These things come, these things go,” a whispering voice urged upon me,\r\n“as once those vast unmeaning Saurians whose bones encumber museums came\r\nand went rejoicing noisily in fruitless lives.”...\r\n\r\nFruitless lives!--was that the truth of it all?...\r\n\r\nLater I stood within sight of the Houses of Parliament in front of the\r\ncolonnades of St Thomas's Hospital. I leant on the parapet close by a\r\nlamp-stand of twisted dolphins--and I prayed!\r\n\r\nI remember the swirl of the tide upon the water, and how a string of\r\nbarges presently came swinging and bumping round as high-water turned\r\nto ebb. That sudden change of position and my brief perplexity at it,\r\nsticks like a paper pin through the substance of my thoughts. It was\r\nthen I was moved to prayer. I prayed that night that life might not\r\nbe in vain, that in particular I might not live in vain. I prayed for\r\nstrength and faith, that the monstrous blundering forces in life might\r\nnot overwhelm me, might not beat me back to futility and a meaningless\r\nacquiescence in existent things. I knew myself for the weakling I was,\r\nI knew that nevertheless it was set for me to make such order as I could\r\nout of these disorders, and my task cowed me, gave me at the thought of\r\nit a sense of yielding feebleness.\r\n\r\n“Break me, O God,” I prayed at last, “disgrace me, torment me, destroy\r\nme as you will, but save me from self-complacency and little interests\r\nand little successes and the life that passes like the shadow of a\r\ndream.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE THIRD: THE HEART OF POLITICS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FIRST ~~ THE RIDDLE FOR THE STATESMAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been planning and replanning, writing and rewriting, this next\r\nportion of my book for many days. I perceive I must leave it raw edged\r\nand ill joined. I have learnt something of the impossibility of History.\r\nFor all I have had to tell is the story of one man's convictions and\r\naims and how they reacted upon his life; and I find it too subtle and\r\ninvolved and intricate for the doing. I find it taxes all my powers to\r\nconvey even the main forms and forces in that development. It is like\r\nlooking through moving media of changing hue and variable refraction\r\nat something vitally unstable. Broad theories and generalisations are\r\nmingled with personal influences, with prevalent prejudices; and\r\nnot only coloured but altered by phases of hopefulness and moods of\r\ndepression. The web is made up of the most diverse elements, beyond\r\ntreatment multitudinous.... For a week or so I desisted altogether,\r\nand walked over the mountains and returned to sit through the warm soft\r\nmornings among the shaded rocks above this little perched-up house of\r\nours, discussing my difficulties with Isabel and I think on the whole\r\ncomplicating them further in the effort to simplify them to manageable\r\nand stateable elements.\r\n\r\nLet me, nevertheless, attempt a rough preliminary analysis of this\r\nconfused process. A main strand is quite easily traceable. This main\r\nstrand is the story of my obvious life, my life as it must have looked\r\nto most of my acquaintances. It presents you with a young couple,\r\nbright, hopeful, and energetic, starting out under Altiora's auspices to\r\nmake a career. You figure us well dressed and active, running about in\r\nmotor-cars, visiting in great people's houses, dining amidst brilliant\r\ncompanies, going to the theatre, meeting in the lobby. Margaret wore\r\nhundreds of beautiful dresses. We must have had an air of succeeding\r\nmeritoriously during that time.\r\n\r\nWe did very continually and faithfully serve our joint career. I thought\r\nabout it a great deal, and did and refrained from doing ten thousand\r\nthings for the sake of it. I kept up a solicitude for it, as it were by\r\ninertia, long after things had happened and changes occurred in me\r\nthat rendered its completion impossible. Under certain very artless\r\npretences, we wanted steadfastly to make a handsome position in the\r\nworld, achieve respect, SUCCEED. Enormous unseen changes had been in\r\nprogress for years in my mind and the realities of my life, before\r\nour general circle could have had any inkling of their existence, or\r\nsuspected the appearances of our life. Then suddenly our proceedings\r\nbegan to be deflected, our outward unanimity visibly strained and marred\r\nby the insurgence of these so long-hidden developments.\r\n\r\nThat career had its own hidden side, of course; but when I write\r\nof these unseen factors I do not mean that but something altogether\r\nbroader. I do not mean the everyday pettinesses which gave the cynical\r\nobserver scope and told of a narrower, baser aspect of the fair but\r\nlimited ambitions of my ostensible self. This “sub-careerist” element\r\nnoted little things that affected the career, made me suspicious of the\r\nrivalry of so-and-so, propitiatory to so-and-so, whom, as a matter of\r\nfact, I didn't respect or feel in the least sympathetic towards; guarded\r\nwith that man, who for all his charm and interest wasn't helpful, and\r\na little touchy at the appearance of neglect from that. No, I mean\r\nsomething greater and not something smaller when I write of a hidden\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIn the ostensible self who glowed under the approbation of Altiora\r\nBailey, and was envied and discussed, praised and depreciated, in the\r\nHouse and in smoking-room gossip, you really have as much of a man as\r\nusually figures in a novel or an obituary notice. But I am tremendously\r\nimpressed now in the retrospect by the realisation of how little that\r\nfrontage represented me, and just how little such frontages do represent\r\nthe complexities of the intelligent contemporary. Behind it, yet\r\nstruggling to disorganise and alter it, altogether, was a far more\r\nessential reality, a self less personal, less individualised, and\r\nbroader in its references. Its aims were never simply to get on; it\r\nhad an altogether different system of demands and satisfactions. It\r\nwas critical, curious, more than a little unfeeling--and relentlessly\r\nilluminating.\r\n\r\nIt is just the existence and development of this more generalised\r\nself-behind-the-frontage that is making modern life so much more subtle\r\nand intricate to render, and so much more hopeful in its relations\r\nto the perplexities of the universe. I see this mental and spiritual\r\nhinterland vary enormously in the people about me, from a type which\r\nseems to keep, as people say, all its goods in the window, to others\r\nwho, like myself, come to regard the ostensible existence more and more\r\nas a mere experimental feeder and agent for that greater personality\r\nbehind. And this back-self has its history of phases, its crises and\r\nhappy accidents and irrevocable conclusions, more or less distinct from\r\nthe adventures and achievements of the ostensible self. It meets persons\r\nand phrases, it assimilates the spirit of a book, it is startled into\r\nnew realisations by some accident that seems altogether irrelevant to\r\nthe general tenor of one's life. Its increasing independence of the\r\nostensible career makes it the organ of corrective criticism; it\r\naccumulates disturbing energy. Then it breaks our overt promises and\r\nrepudiates our pledges, coming down at last like an overbearing mentor\r\nupon the small engagements of the pupil.\r\n\r\nIn the life of the individual it takes the role that the growth of\r\nphilosophy, science, and creative literature may play in the development\r\nof mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is curious to recall how Britten helped shatter that obvious,\r\nlucidly explicable presentation of myself upon which I had embarked\r\nwith Margaret. He returned to revive a memory of adolescent dreams and a\r\nhabit of adolescent frankness; he reached through my shallow frontage\r\nas no one else seemed capable of doing, and dragged that back-self into\r\nrelation with it.\r\n\r\nI remember very distinctly a dinner and a subsequent walk with him\r\nwhich presents itself now as altogether typical of the quality of his\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nI had come upon him one day while lunching with Somers and Sutton at\r\nthe Playwrights' Club, and had asked him to dinner on the spur of the\r\nmoment. He was oddly the same curly-headed, red-faced ventriloquist, and\r\noddly different, rather seedy as well as untidy, and at first a little\r\ninclined to make comparisons with my sleek successfulness. But that\r\ndisposition presently evaporated, and his talk was good and fresh and\r\nprovocative. And something that had long been straining at its checks in\r\nmy mind flapped over, and he and I found ourselves of one accord.\r\n\r\nAltiora wasn't at this dinner. When she came matters were apt to become\r\nconfusedly strenuous. There was always a slight and ineffectual struggle\r\nat the end on the part of Margaret to anticipate Altiora's overpowering\r\ntendency to a rally and the establishment of some entirely unjustifiable\r\nconclusion by a COUP-DE-MAIN. When, however, Altiora was absent, the\r\nquieter influence of the Cramptons prevailed; temperance and information\r\nfor its own sake prevailed excessively over dinner and the play of\r\nthought.... Good Lord! what bores the Cramptons were! I wonder I\r\nendured them as I did. They had all of them the trick of lying in wait\r\nconversationally; they had no sense of the self-exposures, the gallant\r\nexperiments in statement that are necessary for good conversation. They\r\nwould watch one talking with an expression exactly like peeping through\r\nbushes. Then they would, as it were, dash out, dissent succinctly,\r\ncontradict some secondary fact, and back to cover. They gave one\r\ntwilight nerves. Their wives were easier but still difficult at a\r\nstretch; they talked a good deal about children and servants, but with\r\nan air caught from Altiora of making observations upon sociological\r\ntypes. Lewis gossiped about the House in an entirely finite manner. He\r\nnever raised a discussion; nobody ever raised a discussion. He would ask\r\nwhat we thought of Evesham's question that afternoon, and Edward would\r\nsay it was good, and Mrs. Willie, who had been behind the grille, would\r\nthink it was very good, and then Willie, parting the branches, would say\r\nrather conclusively that he didn't think it was very much good, and I\r\nwould deny hearing the question in order to evade a profitless statement\r\nof views in that vacuum, and then we would cast about in our minds for\r\nsome other topic of equal interest....\r\n\r\nOn this occasion Altiora was absent, and to qualify our Young Liberal\r\nbleakness we had Mrs. Millingham, with her white hair and her fresh mind\r\nand complexion, and Esmeer. Willie Crampton was with us, but not his\r\nwife, who was having her third baby on principle; his brother Edward was\r\npresent, and the Lewises, and of course the Bunting Harblows. There was\r\nalso some other lady. I remember her as pale blue, but for the life of\r\nme I cannot remember her name.\r\n\r\nQuite early there was a little breeze between Edward Crampton and\r\nEsmeer, who had ventured an opinion about the partition of Poland.\r\nEdward was at work then upon the seventh volume of his monumental Life\r\nof Kosciusko, and a little impatient with views perhaps not altogether\r\nfalse but betraying a lamentable ignorance of accessible literature. At\r\nany rate, his correction of Esmeer was magisterial. After that there was\r\na distinct and not altogether delightful pause, and then some one, it\r\nmay have been the pale-blue lady, asked Mrs. Lewis whether her aunt Lady\r\nCarmixter had returned from her rest-and-sun-cure in Italy. That led to\r\na rather anxiously sustained talk about regimen, and Willie told us how\r\nhe had profited by the no-breakfast system. It had increased his power\r\nof work enormously. He could get through ten hours a day now without\r\ninconvenience.\r\n\r\n“What do you do?” said Esmeer abruptly.\r\n\r\n“Oh! no end of work. There's all the estate and looking after things.”\r\n\r\n“But publicly?”\r\n\r\n“I asked three questions yesterday. And for one of them I had to consult\r\nnine books!”\r\n\r\nWe were drifting, I could see, towards Doctor Haig's system of dietary,\r\nand whether the exclusion or inclusion of fish and chicken were most\r\nconducive to high efficiency, when Britten, who had refused lemonade\r\nand claret and demanded Burgundy, broke out, and was discovered to be\r\ndemanding in his throat just what we Young Liberals thought we were up\r\nto?\r\n\r\n“I want,” said Britten, repeating his challenge a little louder, “to\r\nhear just exactly what you think you are doing in Parliament?”\r\n\r\nLewis laughed nervously, and thought we were “Seeking the Good of the\r\nCommunity.”\r\n\r\n“HOW?”\r\n\r\n“Beneficient Legislation,” said Lewis.\r\n\r\n“Beneficient in what direction?” insisted Britten. “I want to know where\r\nyou think you are going.”\r\n\r\n“Amelioration of Social Conditions,” said Lewis.\r\n\r\n“That's only a phrase!”\r\n\r\n“You wouldn't have me sketch bills at dinner?”\r\n\r\n“I'd like you to indicate directions,” said Britten, and waited.\r\n\r\n“Upward and On,” said Lewis with conscious neatness, and turned to ask\r\nMrs. Bunting Harblow about her little boy's French.\r\n\r\nFor a time talk frothed over Britten's head, but the natural mischief\r\nin Mrs. Millingham had been stirred, and she was presently echoing his\r\ndemand in lisping, quasi-confidential undertones. “What ARE we Liberals\r\ndoing?” Then Esmeer fell in with the revolutionaries.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, I was a little shocked by this clamour for\r\nfundamentals--and a little disconcerted. I had the experience that I\r\nsuppose comes to every one at times of discovering oneself together with\r\ntwo different sets of people with whom one has maintained two different\r\nsets of attitudes. It had always been, I perceived, an instinctive\r\nsuppression in our circle that we shouldn't be more than vague about our\r\npolitical ideals. It had almost become part of my morality to respect\r\nthis convention. It was understood we were all working hard, and keeping\r\nourselves fit, tremendously fit, under Altiora's inspiration, Pro Bono\r\nPublico. Bunting Harblow had his under-secretaryship, and Lewis was on\r\nthe verge of the Cabinet, and these things we considered to be in the\r\nnature of confirmations.... It added to the discomfort of the situation\r\nthat these plunging enquiries were being made in the presence of our\r\nwives.\r\n\r\nThe rebel section of our party forced the talk.\r\n\r\nEdward Crampton was presently declaring--I forget in what relation: “The\r\ncountry is with us.”\r\n\r\nMy long-controlled hatred of the Cramptons' stereotyped phrases about\r\nthe Country and the House got the better of me. I showed my cloven hoof\r\nto my friends for the first time.\r\n\r\n“We don't respect the Country as we used to do,” I said. “We haven't\r\nthe same belief we used to have in the will of the people. It's no\r\ngood, Crampton, trying to keep that up. We Liberals know as a matter of\r\nfact--nowadays every one knows--that the monster that brought us into\r\npower has, among other deficiencies, no head. We've got to give it\r\none--if possible with brains and a will. That lies in the future. For\r\nthe present if the country is with us, it means merely that we happen to\r\nhave hold of its tether.”\r\n\r\nLewis was shocked. A “mandate” from the Country was sacred to his system\r\nof pretences.\r\n\r\nBritten wasn't subdued by his first rebuff; presently he was at\r\nus again. There were several attempts to check his outbreak of\r\ninterrogation; I remember the Cramptons asked questions about the\r\nwelfare of various cousins of Lewis who were unknown to the rest of us,\r\nand Margaret tried to engage Britten in a sympathetic discussion of the\r\nArts and Crafts exhibition. But Britten and Esmeer were persistent, Mrs.\r\nMillingham was mischievous, and in the end our rising hopes of Young\r\nLiberalism took to their thickets for good, while we talked all over\r\nthem of the prevalent vacuity of political intentions. Margaret was\r\nperplexed by me. It is only now I perceive just how perplexing I must\r\nhave been. “Of course, she said with that faint stress of apprehension\r\nin her eyes, one must have aims.” And, “it isn't always easy to put\r\neverything into phrases.” “Don't be long,” said Mrs. Edward Crampton\r\nto her husband as the wives trooped out. And afterwards when we went\r\nupstairs I had an indefinable persuasion that the ladies had been\r\ncriticising Britten's share in our talk in an altogether unfavourable\r\nspirit. Mrs. Edward evidently thought him aggressive and impertinent,\r\nand Margaret with a quiet firmness that brooked no resistance, took him\r\nat once into a corner and showed him Italian photographs by Coburn. We\r\ndispersed early.\r\n\r\nI walked with Britten along the Chelsea back streets towards Battersea\r\nBridge--he lodged on the south side.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Millingham's a dear,” he began.\r\n\r\n“She's a dear.”\r\n\r\n“I liked her demand for a hansom because a four-wheeler was too safe.”\r\n\r\n“She was worked up,” I said. “She's a woman of faultless character, but\r\nher instincts, as Altiora would say, are anarchistic--when she gives\r\nthem a chance.”\r\n\r\n“So she takes it out in hansom cabs.”\r\n\r\n“Hansom cabs.”\r\n\r\n“She's wise,” said Britten....\r\n\r\n“I hope, Remington,” he went on after a pause, “I didn't rag your other\r\nguests too much. I've a sort of feeling at moments--Remington, those\r\nchaps are so infernally not--not bloody. It's part of a man's duty\r\nsometimes at least to eat red beef and get drunk. How is he to\r\nunderstand government if he doesn't? It scares me to think of your\r\nlot--by a sort of misapprehension--being in power. A kind of neuralgia\r\nin the head, by way of government. I don't understand where YOU come in.\r\nThose others--they've no lusts. Their ideal is anaemia. You and I,\r\nwe had at least a lust to take hold of life and make something of it.\r\nThey--they want to take hold of life and make nothing of it. They want\r\nto cut out all the stimulants. Just as though life was anything else but\r\na reaction to stimulation!”...\r\n\r\nHe began to talk of his own life. He had had ill-fortune through most\r\nof it. He was poor and unsuccessful, and a girl he had been very fond\r\nof had been attacked and killed by a horse in a field in a very horrible\r\nmanner. These things had wounded and tortured him, but they hadn't\r\nbroken him. They had, it seemed to me, made a kind of crippled and ugly\r\ndemigod of him. He was, I began to perceive, so much better than I had\r\nany right to expect. At first I had been rather struck by his unkempt\r\nlook, and it made my reaction all the stronger. There was about him\r\nsomething, a kind of raw and bleeding faith in the deep things of\r\nlife, that stirred me profoundly as he showed it. My set of people had\r\nirritated him and disappointed him. I discovered at his touch how they\r\nirritated him. He reproached me boldly. He made me feel ashamed of my\r\neasy acquiescences as I walked in my sleek tall neatness beside his\r\nrather old coat, his rather battered hat, his sturdier shorter shape,\r\nand listened to his denunciations of our self-satisfied New Liberalism\r\nand Progressivism.\r\n\r\n“It has the same relation to progress--the reality of progress--that the\r\nthings they paint on door panels in the suburbs have to art and beauty.\r\nThere's a sort of filiation.... Your Altiora's just the political\r\nequivalent of the ladies who sell traced cloth for embroidery; she's\r\na dealer in Refined Social Reform for the Parlour. The real progress,\r\nRemington, is a graver thing and a painfuller thing and a slower thing\r\naltogether. Look! THAT”--and he pointed to where under a boarding in the\r\nlight of a gas lamp a dingy prostitute stood lurking--“was in Babylon\r\nand Nineveh. Your little lot make believe there won't be anything of the\r\nsort after this Parliament! They're going to vanish at a few top notes\r\nfrom Altiora Bailey! Remington!--it's foolery. It's prigs at play.\r\nIt's make-believe, make-believe! Your people there haven't got hold of\r\nthings, aren't beginning to get hold of things, don't know anything of\r\nlife at all, shirk life, avoid life, get in little bright clean rooms\r\nand talk big over your bumpers of lemonade while the Night goes by\r\noutside--untouched. Those Crampton fools slink by all this,”--he\r\nwaved at the woman again--“pretend it doesn't exist, or is going to be\r\nbanished root and branch by an Act to keep children in the wet outside\r\npublic-houses. Do you think they really care, Remington? I don't. It's\r\nmake-believe. What they want to do, what Lewis wants to do, what Mrs.\r\nBunting Harblow wants her husband to do, is to sit and feel very grave\r\nand necessary and respected on the Government benches. They think of\r\nputting their feet out like statesmen, and tilting shiny hats with\r\nbecoming brims down over their successful noses. Presentation portrait\r\nto a club at fifty. That's their Reality. That's their scope. They\r\ndon't, it's manifest, WANT to think beyond that. The things there ARE,\r\nRemington, they'll never face! the wonder and the depth of life,--lust,\r\nand the night-sky,--pain.”\r\n\r\n“But the good intention,” I pleaded, “the Good Will!”\r\n\r\n“Sentimentality,” said Britten. “No Good Will is anything but dishonesty\r\nunless it frets and burns and hurts and destroys a man. That lot of\r\nyours have nothing but a good will to think they have good will. Do you\r\nthink they lie awake of nights searching their hearts as we do? Lewis?\r\nCrampton? Or those neat, admiring, satisfied little wives? See how they\r\nshrank from the probe!”\r\n\r\n“We all,” I said, “shrink from the probe.”\r\n\r\n“God help us!” said Britten....\r\n\r\n“We are but vermin at the best, Remington,” he broke out, “and the\r\ngreatest saint only a worm that has lifted its head for a moment from\r\nthe dust. We are damned, we are meant to be damned, coral animalculae\r\nbuilding upward, upward in a sea of damnation. But of all the damned\r\nthings that ever were damned, your damned shirking, temperate,\r\nsham-efficient, self-satisfied, respectable, make-believe,\r\nFabian-spirited Young Liberal is the utterly damnedest.” He paused for\r\na moment, and resumed in an entirely different note: “Which is why I was\r\nso surprised, Remington, to find YOU in this set!”\r\n\r\n“You're just the old plunger you used to be, Britten,” I said. “You're\r\ngoing too far with all your might for the sake of the damns. Like a\r\ndonkey that drags its cart up a bank to get thistles. There's depths in\r\nLiberalism--”\r\n\r\n“We were talking about Liberals.”\r\n\r\n“Liberty!”\r\n\r\n“Liberty! What do YOOR little lot know of liberty?”\r\n\r\n“What does any little lot know of liberty?”\r\n\r\n“It waits outside, too big for our understanding. Like the night and the\r\nstars. And lust, Remington! lust and bitterness! Don't I know them? with\r\nall the sweetness and hope of life bitten and trampled, the dear eyes\r\nand the brain that loved and understood--and my poor mumble of a life\r\ngoing on! I'm within sight of being a drunkard, Remington! I'm a failure\r\nby most standards! Life has cut me to the bone. But I'm not afraid of it\r\nany more. I've paid something of the price, I've seen something of the\r\nmeaning.”\r\n\r\nHe flew off at a tangent. “I'd rather die in Delirium Tremens,” he\r\ncried, “than be a Crampton or a Lewis....”\r\n\r\n“Make-believe. Make-believe.” The phrase and Britten's squat gestures\r\nhaunted me as I walked homeward alone. I went to my room and stood\r\nbefore my desk and surveyed papers and files and Margaret's admirable\r\nequipment of me.\r\n\r\nI perceived in the lurid light of Britten's suggestions that so it was\r\nMr. George Alexander would have mounted a statesman's private room....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nI was never at any stage a loyal party man. I doubt if party will\r\never again be the force it was during the eighteenth and nineteenth\r\ncenturies. Men are becoming increasingly constructive and selective,\r\nless patient under tradition and the bondage of initial circumstances.\r\nAs education becomes more universal and liberating, men will sort\r\nthemselves more and more by their intellectual temperaments and less and\r\nless by their accidental associations. The past will rule them less; the\r\nfuture more. It is not simply party but school and college and county\r\nand country that lose their glamour. One does not hear nearly as much\r\nas our forefathers did of the “old Harrovian,” “old Arvonian,” “old\r\nEtonian” claim to this or that unfair advantage or unearnt sympathy.\r\nEven the Scotch and the Devonians weaken a little in their clannishness.\r\nA widening sense of fair play destroys such things. They follow\r\nfreemasonry down--freemasonry of which one is chiefly reminded nowadays\r\nin England by propitiatory symbols outside shady public-houses....\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, a type of man which clings very obstinately to\r\nparty ties. These are the men with strong reproductive imaginations\r\nand no imaginative initiative, such men as Cladingbowl, for example, or\r\nDayton. They are the scholars-at-large in life. For them the fact that\r\nthe party system has been essential in the history of England for two\r\nhundred years gives it an overwhelming glamour. They have read histories\r\nand memoirs, they see the great grey pile of Westminster not so much\r\nfor what it is as for what it was, rich with dramatic memories, populous\r\nwith glorious ghosts, phrasing itself inevitably in anecdotes and\r\nquotations. It seems almost scandalous that new things should continue\r\nto happen, swamping with strange qualities the savour of these old\r\nassociations.\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Ramsay Macdonald should walk through Westminster Hall, thrust\r\nhimself, it may be, through the very piece of space that once held\r\nCharles the Martyr pleading for his life, seems horrible profanation to\r\nDayton, a last posthumous outrage; and he would, I think, like to have\r\nthe front benches left empty now for ever, or at most adorned with\r\nlaureated ivory tablets: “Here Dizzy sat,” and “On this Spot William\r\nEwart Gladstone made his First Budget Speech.” Failing this, he demands,\r\nif only as signs of modesty and respect on the part of the survivors,\r\nmeticulous imitation. “Mr. G.,” he murmurs, “would not have done that,”\r\n and laments a vanished subtlety even while Mr. Evesham is speaking. He\r\nis always gloomily disposed to lapse into wonderings about what\r\nthings are coming to, wonderings that have no grain of curiosity. His\r\nconception of perfect conduct is industrious persistence along the\r\nworn-down, well-marked grooves of the great recorded days. So infinitely\r\nmore important to him is the documented, respected thing than the\r\nelusive present.\r\n\r\nCladingbowl and Dayton do not shine in the House, though Cladingbowl is\r\na sound man on a committee, and Dayton keeps the OLD COUNTRY GAZETTE,\r\nthe most gentlemanly paper in London. They prevail, however, in their\r\nclubs at lunch time. There, with the pleasant consciousness of a\r\nmorning's work free from either zeal or shirking, they mingle with\r\npermanent officials, prominent lawyers, even a few of the soberer type\r\nof business men, and relax their minds in the discussion of the morning\r\npaper, of the architecture of the West End, and of the latest public\r\nappointments, of golf, of holiday resorts, of the last judicial\r\nwitticisms and forensic “crushers.” The New Year and Birthday honours\r\nlists are always very sagely and exhaustively considered, and anecdotes\r\nare popular and keenly judged. They do not talk of the things that are\r\nreally active in their minds, but in the formal and habitual manner they\r\nsuppose to be proper to intelligent but still honourable men. Socialism,\r\nindividual money matters, and religion are forbidden topics, and sex and\r\nwomen only in so far as they appear in the law courts. It is to me\r\nthe strangest of conventions, this assumption of unreal loyalties and\r\ntraditional respects, this repudiation and concealment of passionate\r\ninterests. It is like wearing gloves in summer fields, or bathing in a\r\ngown, or falling in love with the heroine of a novel, or writing under a\r\npseudonym, or becoming a masked Tuareg....\r\n\r\nIt is not, I think, that men of my species are insensitive to the great\r\npast that is embodied in Westminster and its traditions; we are not so\r\nmuch wanting in the historical sense as alive to the greatness of our\r\npresent opportunities and the still vaster future that is possible to\r\nus. London is the most interesting, beautiful, and wonderful city in the\r\nworld to me, delicate in her incidental and multitudinous littleness,\r\nand stupendous in her pregnant totality; I cannot bring myself to use\r\nher as a museum or an old bookshop. When I think of Whitehall that\r\nlittle affair on the scaffold outside the Banqueting Hall seems trivial\r\nand remote in comparison with the possibilities that offer themselves to\r\nmy imagination within the great grey Government buildings close at hand.\r\n\r\nIt gives me a qualm of nostalgia even to name those places now. I think\r\nof St. Stephen's tower streaming upwards into the misty London night and\r\nthe great wet quadrangle of New Palace Yard, from which the hansom cabs\r\nof my first experiences were ousted more and more by taxicabs as the\r\nsecond Parliament of King Edward the Seventh aged; I think of the\r\nAdmiralty and War office with their tall Marconi masts sending out\r\ninvisible threads of direction to the armies in the camps, to great\r\nfleets about the world. The crowded, darkly shining river goes flooding\r\nthrough my memory once again, on to those narrow seas that part us\r\nfrom our rival nations; I see quadrangles and corridors of spacious\r\ngrey-toned offices in which undistinguished little men and little files\r\nof papers link us to islands in the tropics, to frozen wildernesses\r\ngashed for gold, to vast temple-studded plains, to forest worlds\r\nand mountain worlds, to ports and fortresses and lighthouses and\r\nwatch-towers and grazing lands and corn lands all about the globe. Once\r\nmore I traverse Victoria Street, grimy and dark, where the Agents of the\r\nEmpire jostle one another, pass the big embassies in the West End\r\nwith their flags and scutcheons, follow the broad avenue that leads to\r\nBuckingham Palace, witness the coming and going of troops and officials\r\nand guests along it from every land on earth.... Interwoven in the\r\ntexture of it all, mocking, perplexing, stimulating beyond measure, is\r\nthe gleaming consciousness, the challenging knowledge: “You and your\r\nkind might still, if you could but grasp it here, mould all the destiny\r\nof Man!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\nMy first three years in Parliament were years of active discontent. The\r\nlittle group of younger Liberals to which I belonged was very ignorant\r\nof the traditions and qualities of our older leaders, and quite out of\r\ntouch with the mass of the party. For a time Parliament was enormously\r\ntaken up with moribund issues and old quarrels. The early Educational\r\nlegislation was sectarian and unenterprising, and the Licensing Bill\r\nwent little further than the attempted rectification of a Conservative\r\nmistake. I was altogether for the nationalisation of the public-houses,\r\nand of this end the Bill gave no intimations. It was just beer-baiting.\r\nI was recalcitrant almost from the beginning, and spoke against the\r\nGovernment so early as the second reading of the first Education Bill,\r\nthe one the Lords rejected in 1906. I went a little beyond my intention\r\nin the heat of speaking,--it is a way with inexperienced man. I called\r\nthe Bill timid, narrow, a mere sop to the jealousies of sects and\r\nlittle-minded people. I contrasted its aim and methods with the manifest\r\nneeds of the time.\r\n\r\nI am not a particularly good speaker; after the manner of a writer I\r\nworry to find my meaning too much; but this was one of my successes. I\r\nspoke after dinner and to a fairly full House, for people were already\r\na little curious about me because of my writings. Several of the\r\nConservative leaders were present and stayed, and Mr. Evesham,\r\nI remember, came ostentatiously to hear me, with that engaging\r\nfriendliness of his, and gave me at the first chance an approving “Hear,\r\nHear!” I can still recall quite distinctly my two futile attempts to\r\ncatch the Speaker's eye before I was able to begin, the nervous quiver\r\nof my rather too prepared opening, the effect of hearing my own voice\r\nand my subconscious wonder as to what I could possibly be talking\r\nabout, the realisation that I was getting on fairly well, the immense\r\nsatisfaction afterwards of having on the whole brought it off, and the\r\nabsurd gratitude I felt for that encouraging cheer.\r\n\r\nAddressing the House of Commons is like no other public speaking in the\r\nworld. Its semi-colloquial methods give it an air of being easy, but\r\nits shifting audience, the comings and goings and hesitations of members\r\nbehind the chair--not mere audience units, but men who matter--the\r\ndesolating emptiness that spreads itself round the man who fails to\r\ninterest, the little compact, disciplined crowd in the strangers'\r\ngallery, the light, elusive, flickering movements high up behind the\r\ngrill, the wigged, attentive, weary Speaker, the table and the mace\r\nand the chapel-like Gothic background with its sombre shadows, conspire\r\ntogether, produce a confused, uncertain feeling in me, as though I was\r\nwalking upon a pavement full of trap-doors and patches of uncovered\r\nmorass. A misplaced, well-meant “Hear, Hear!” is apt to be\r\nextraordinarily disconcerting, and under no other circumstances have I\r\nhad to speak with quite the same sideways twist that the arrangement of\r\nthe House imposes. One does not recognise one's own voice threading out\r\ninto the stirring brown. Unless I was excited or speaking to the mind of\r\nsome particular person in the house, I was apt to lose my feeling of an\r\nauditor. I had no sense of whither my sentences were going, such as one\r\nhas with a public meeting well under one's eye. And to lose one's sense\r\nof an auditor is for a man of my temperament to lose one's sense of the\r\nimmediate, and to become prolix and vague with qualifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\nMy discontents with the Liberal party and my mental exploration of\r\nthe quality of party generally is curiously mixed up with certain\r\nimpressions of things and people in the National Liberal Club. The\r\nNational Liberal Club is Liberalism made visible in the flesh--and\r\nDoultonware. It is an extraordinary big club done in a bold, wholesale,\r\nshiny, marbled style, richly furnished with numerous paintings, steel\r\nengravings, busts, and full-length statues of the late Mr. Gladstone;\r\nand its spacious dining-rooms, its long, hazy, crowded smoking-room with\r\ninnumerable little tables and groups of men in armchairs, its\r\nmagazine room and library upstairs, have just that undistinguished and\r\nunconcentrated diversity which is for me the Liberal note. The pensive\r\nmember sits and hears perplexing dialects and even fragments of foreign\r\nspeech, and among the clustering masses of less insistent whites his\r\nroving eye catches profiles and complexions that send his mind afield to\r\nCalcutta or Rangoon or the West Indies or Sierra Leone or the Cape....\r\n\r\nI was not infrequently that pensive member. I used to go to the Club to\r\ndoubt about Liberalism.\r\n\r\nAbout two o'clock in the day the great smoking-room is crowded with\r\ncountless little groups. They sit about small round tables, or in\r\ncircles of chairs, and the haze of tobacco seems to prolong the great\r\nnarrow place, with its pillars and bays, to infinity. Some of the groups\r\nare big, as many as a dozen men talk in loud tones; some are duologues,\r\nand there is always a sprinkling of lonely, dissociated men. At first\r\none gets an impression of men going from group to group and as it were\r\nlinking them, but as one watches closely one finds that these men just\r\nvisit three or four groups at the outside, and know nothing of the\r\nothers. One begins to perceive more and more distinctly that one is\r\ndealing with a sort of human mosaic; that each patch in that great place\r\nis of a different quality and colour from the next and never to be mixed\r\nwith it. Most clubs have a common link, a lowest common denominator in\r\nthe Club Bore, who spares no one, but even the National Liberal bores\r\nare specialised and sectional. As one looks round one sees here a clump\r\nof men from the North Country or the Potteries, here an island of\r\nSouth London politicians, here a couple of young Jews ascendant from\r\nWhitechapel, here a circle of journalists and writers, here a group of\r\nIrish politicians, here two East Indians, here a priest or so, here\r\na clump of old-fashioned Protestants, here a little knot of eminent\r\nRationalists indulging in a blasphemous story SOTTO VOCE. Next them are\r\na group of anglicised Germans and highly specialised chess-players,\r\nand then two of the oddest-looking persons--bulging with documents and\r\nintent upon extraordinary business transactions over long cigars....\r\n\r\nI would listen to a stormy sea of babblement, and try to extract some\r\nconstructive intimations. Every now and then I got a whiff of politics.\r\nIt was clear they were against the Lords--against plutocrats--against\r\nCossington's newspapers--against the brewers.... It was tremendously\r\nclear what they were against. The trouble was to find out what on earth\r\nthey were for!...\r\n\r\nAs I sat and thought, the streaked and mottled pillars and wall, the\r\nvarious views, aspects, and portraits of Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone, the\r\npartitions of polished mahogany, the yellow-vested waiters, would\r\ndissolve and vanish, and I would have a vision of this sample of\r\nmiscellaneous men of limited, diverse interests and a universal\r\nlittleness of imagination enlarged, unlimited, no longer a sample but a\r\ncommunity, spreading, stretching out to infinity--all in little groups\r\nand duologues and circles, all with their special and narrow concerns,\r\nall with their backs to most of the others.\r\n\r\nWhat but a common antagonism would ever keep these multitudes together?\r\nI understood why modern electioneering is more than half of it\r\ndenunciation. Let us condemn, if possible, let us obstruct and deprive,\r\nbut not let us do. There is no real appeal to the commonplace mind in\r\n“Let us do.” That calls for the creative imagination, and few have been\r\naccustomed to respond to that call. The other merely needs jealousy and\r\nbate, of which there are great and easily accessible reservoirs in every\r\nhuman heart....\r\n\r\nI remember that vision of endless, narrow, jealous individuality very\r\nvividly. A seething limitlessness it became at last, like a waste place\r\ncovered by crawling locusts that men sweep up by the sackload and drown\r\nby the million in ditches....\r\n\r\nGrotesquely against it came the lean features, the sidelong shy\r\nmovements of Edward Crampton, seated in a circle of talkers close at\r\nhand. I had a whiff of his strained, unmusical voice, and behold! he was\r\nsaying something about the “Will of the People....”\r\n\r\nThe immense and wonderful disconnectednesses of human life! I forgot the\r\nsmoke and jabber of the club altogether; I became a lonely spirit flung\r\naloft by some queer accident, a stone upon a ledge in some high and\r\nrocky wilderness, and below as far as the eye could reach stretched the\r\nswarming infinitesimals of humanity, like grass upon the field, like\r\npebbles upon unbounded beaches. Was there ever to be in human life\r\nmore than that endless struggling individualism? Was there indeed some\r\ngiantry, some immense valiant synthesis, still to come--or present it\r\nmight be and still unseen by me, or was this the beginning and withal\r\nthe last phase of mankind?...\r\n\r\nI glimpsed for a while the stupendous impudence of our ambitions,\r\nthe tremendous enterprise to which the modern statesman is implicitly\r\naddressed. I was as it were one of a little swarm of would-be reef\r\nbuilders looking back at the teeming slime upon the ocean floor. All the\r\nhistory of mankind, all the history of life, has been and will be\r\nthe story of something struggling out of the indiscriminated abyss,\r\nstruggling to exist and prevail over and comprehend individual lives--an\r\neffort of insidious attraction, an idea of invincible appeal. That\r\nsomething greater than ourselves, which does not so much exist as seek\r\nexistence, palpitating between being and not-being, how marvellous it\r\nis! It has worn the form and visage of ten thousand different gods,\r\nsought a shape for itself in stone and ivory and music and wonderful\r\nwords, spoken more and more clearly of a mystery of love, a mystery\r\nof unity, dabbling meanwhile in blood and cruelty beyond the common\r\nimpulses of men. It is something that comes and goes, like a light that\r\nshines and is withdrawn, withdrawn so completely that one doubts if it\r\nhas ever been....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\r\nI would mark with a curious interest the stray country member of\r\nthe club up in town for a night or so. My mind would be busy with\r\nspeculations about him, about his home, his family, his reading, his\r\nhorizons, his innumerable fellows who didn't belong and never came up.\r\nI would fill in the outline of him with memories of my uncle and his\r\nStaffordshire neighbours. He was perhaps Alderman This or Councillor\r\nThat down there, a great man in his ward, J. P. within seven miles of\r\nthe boundary of the borough, and a God in his home. Here he was nobody,\r\nand very shy, and either a little too arrogant or a little too meek\r\ntowards our very democratic mannered but still livened waiters. Was\r\nhe perhaps the backbone of England? He over-ate himself lest he should\r\nappear mean, went through our Special Dinner conscientiously, drank,\r\nunless he was teetotal, of unfamiliar wines, and did his best, in spite\r\nof the rules, to tip. Afterwards, in a state of flushed repletion, he\r\nwould have old brandy, black coffee, and a banded cigar, or in the\r\nname of temperance omit the brandy and have rather more coffee, in\r\nthe smoking-room. I would sit and watch that stiff dignity of\r\nself-indulgence, and wonder, wonder....\r\n\r\nAn infernal clairvoyance would come to me. I would have visions of him\r\nin relation to his wife, checking always, sometimes bullying, sometimes\r\nbeing ostentatiously “kind”; I would see him glance furtively at his\r\ndomestic servants upon his staircase, or stiffen his upper lip against\r\nthe reluctant, protesting business employee. We imaginative people\r\nare base enough, heaven knows, but it is only in rare moods of bitter\r\npenetration that we pierce down to the baser lusts, the viler shames,\r\nthe everlasting lying and muddle-headed self-justification of the dull.\r\n\r\nI would turn my eyes down the crowded room and see others of him and\r\nothers. What did he think he was up to? Did he for a moment realise that\r\nhis presence under that ceramic glory of a ceiling with me meant, if it\r\nhad any rational meaning at all, that we were jointly doing something\r\nwith the nation and the empire and mankind?... How on earth could any\r\none get hold of him, make any noble use of him? He didn't read beyond\r\nhis newspaper. He never thought, but only followed imaginings in his\r\nheart. He never discussed. At the first hint of discussion his temper\r\ngave way. He was, I knew, a deep, thinly-covered tank of resentments\r\nand quite irrational moral rages. Yet withal I would have to resist an\r\nimpulse to go over to him and nudge him and say to him, “Look here!\r\nWhat indeed do you think we are doing with the nation and the empire and\r\nmankind? You know--MANKIND!”\r\n\r\nI wonder what reply I should have got.\r\n\r\nSo far as any average could be struck and so far as any backbone could\r\nbe located, it seemed to me that this silent, shy, replete, sub-angry,\r\nmiddle-class sentimentalist was in his endless species and varieties and\r\ndialects the backbone of our party. So far as I could be considered as\r\nrepresenting anything in the House, I pretended to sit for the elements\r\nof HIM....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a time I turned towards the Socialists. They at least had an air of\r\ncoherent intentions. At that time Socialism had come into politics again\r\nafter a period of depression and obscurity, with a tremendous ECLAT.\r\nThere was visibly a following of Socialist members to Chris Robinson;\r\nmysteriously uncommunicative gentlemen in soft felt hats and short\r\ncoats and square-toed boots who replied to casual advances a little\r\nsurprisingly in rich North Country dialects. Members became aware of a\r\n“seagreen incorruptible,” as Colonel Marlow put it to me, speaking on\r\nthe Address, a slender twisted figure supporting itself on a stick and\r\nspeaking with a fire that was altogether revolutionary. This was Philip\r\nSnowden, the member for Blackburn. They had come in nearly forty\r\nstrong altogether, and with an air of presently meaning to come in much\r\nstronger. They were only one aspect of what seemed at that time a big\r\nnational movement. Socialist societies, we gathered, were springing up\r\nall over the country, and every one was inquiring about Socialism and\r\ndiscussing Socialism. It had taken the Universities with particular\r\nforce, and any youngster with the slightest intellectual pretension was\r\neither actively for or brilliantly against. For a time our Young Liberal\r\ngroup was ostentatiously sympathetic....\r\n\r\nWhen I think of the Socialists there comes a vivid memory of certain\r\nevening gatherings at our house....\r\n\r\nThese gatherings had been organised by Margaret as the outcome of\r\na discussion at the Baileys'. Altiora had been very emphatic and\r\nuncharitable upon the futility of the Socialist movement. It seemed that\r\neven the leaders fought shy of dinner-parties.\r\n\r\n“They never meet each other,” said Altiora, “much less people on the\r\nother side. How can they begin to understand politics until they do\r\nthat?”\r\n\r\n“Most of them have totally unpresentable wives,” said Altiora,\r\n“totally!” and quoted instances, “and they WILL bring them. Or they\r\nwon't come! Some of the poor creatures have scarcely learnt their table\r\nmanners. They just make holes in the talk....”\r\n\r\nI thought there was a great deal of truth beneath Altiora's outburst.\r\nThe presentation of the Socialist case seemed very greatly crippled\r\nby the want of a common intimacy in its leaders; the want of intimacy\r\ndidn't at first appear to be more than an accident, and our talk led to\r\nMargaret's attempt to get acquaintance and easy intercourse afoot among\r\nthem and between them and the Young Liberals of our group. She gave a\r\nseries of weekly dinners, planned, I think, a little too accurately upon\r\nAltiora's model, and after each we had as catholic a reception as we\r\ncould contrive.\r\n\r\nOur receptions were indeed, I should think, about as catholic as\r\nreceptions could be. Margaret found herself with a weekly houseful of\r\ninsoluble problems in intercourse. One did one's best, but one got a\r\nnightmare feeling as the evening wore on.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the few unanimities of these parties that every one should\r\nbe a little odd in appearance, funny about the hair or the tie or the\r\nshoes or more generally, and that bursts of violent aggression should\r\nalternate with an attitude entirely defensive. A number of our guests\r\nhad an air of waiting for a clue that never came, and stood and sat\r\nabout silently, mildly amused but not a bit surprised that we did not\r\ndiscover their distinctive Open-Sesames. There was a sprinkling of\r\nmanifest seers and prophetesses in shapeless garments, far too many, I\r\nthought, for really easy social intercourse, and any conversation at any\r\nmoment was liable to become oracular. One was in a state of tension\r\nfrom first to last; the most innocent remark seemed capable of exploding\r\nresentment, and replies came out at the most unexpected angles. We Young\r\nLiberals went about puzzled but polite to the gathering we had evoked.\r\nThe Young Liberals' tradition is on the whole wonderfully discreet,\r\nsuperfluous steam is let out far away from home in the Balkans or\r\nAfrica, and the neat, stiff figures of the Cramptons, Bunting Harblow,\r\nand Lewis, either in extremely well-cut morning coats indicative of the\r\nHouse, or in what is sometimes written of as “faultless evening dress,”\r\n stood about on those evenings, they and their very quietly and simply\r\nand expensively dressed little wives, like a datum line amidst lakes and\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nI didn't at first see the connection between systematic social\r\nreorganisation and arbitrary novelties in dietary and costume, just as\r\nI didn't realise why the most comprehensive constructive projects should\r\nappear to be supported solely by odd and exceptional personalities.\r\nOn one of these evenings a little group of rather jolly-looking pretty\r\nyoung people seated themselves for no particular reason in a large\r\ncircle on the floor of my study, and engaged, so far as I could judge,\r\nin the game of Hunt the Meaning, the intellectual equivalent of Hunt the\r\nSlipper. It must have been that same evening I came upon an unbleached\r\nyoung gentleman before the oval mirror on the landing engaged in\r\nremoving the remains of an anchovy sandwich from his protruded\r\ntongue--visible ends of cress having misled him into the belief that he\r\nwas dealing with doctrinally permissible food. It was not unusual to be\r\ngiven hand-bills and printed matter by our guests, but there I had\r\nthe advantage over Lewis, who was too tactful to refuse the stuff, too\r\nneatly dressed to pocket it, and had no writing-desk available upon\r\nwhich he could relieve himself in a manner flattering to the giver. So\r\nthat his hands got fuller and fuller. A relentless, compact little woman\r\nin what Margaret declared to be an extremely expensive black dress\r\nhas also printed herself on my memory; she had set her heart upon my\r\ncontributing to a weekly periodical in the lentil interest with which\r\nshe was associated, and I spent much time and care in evading her.\r\n\r\nMingling with the more hygienic types were a number of Anti-Puritan\r\nSocialists, bulging with bias against temperance, and breaking out\r\nagainst austere methods of living all over their faces. Their manner\r\nwas packed with heartiness. They were apt to choke the approaches to\r\nthe little buffet Margaret had set up downstairs, and there engage in\r\ndiscussions of Determinism--it always seemed to be Determinism--which\r\nbecame heartier and noisier, but never acrimonious even in the small\r\nhours. It seemed impossible to settle about this Determinism of\r\ntheirs--ever. And there were worldly Socialists also. I particularly\r\nrecall a large, active, buoyant, lady-killing individual with an\r\neyeglass borne upon a broad black ribbon, who swam about us one evening.\r\nHe might have been a slightly frayed actor, in his large frock-coat,\r\nhis white waistcoat, and the sort of black and white check trousers that\r\ntwinkle. He had a high-pitched voice with aristocratic intonations, and\r\nhe seemed to be in a perpetual state of interrogation. “What are we\r\nall he-a for?” he would ask only too audibly. “What are we doing he-a?\r\nWhat's the connection?”\r\n\r\nWhat WAS the connection?\r\n\r\nWe made a special effort with our last assembly in June, 1907. We tried\r\nto get something like a representative collection of the parliamentary\r\nleaders of Socialism, the various exponents of Socialist thought and a\r\nnumber of Young Liberal thinkers into one room. Dorvil came, and Horatio\r\nBulch; Featherstonehaugh appeared for ten minutes and talked charmingly\r\nto Margaret and then vanished again; there was Wilkins the novelist and\r\nToomer and Dr. Tumpany. Chris Robinson stood about for a time in a new\r\ncomforter, and Magdeberg and Will Pipes and five or six Labour members.\r\nAnd on our side we had our particular little group, Bunting Harblow,\r\nCrampton, Lewis, all looking as broad-minded and open to conviction as\r\nthey possibly could, and even occasionally talking out from their bushes\r\nalmost boldly. But the gathering as a whole refused either to mingle or\r\ndispute, and as an experiment in intercourse the evening was a failure.\r\nUnexpected dissociations appeared between Socialists one had supposed\r\nfriendly. I could not have imagined it was possible for half so many\r\npeople to turn their backs on everybody else in such small rooms as\r\nours. But the unsaid things those backs expressed broke out, I remarked,\r\nwith refreshed virulence in the various organs of the various sections\r\nof the party next week.\r\n\r\nI talked, I remember, with Dr. Tumpany, a large young man in a still\r\nlarger professional frock-coat, and with a great shock of very fair\r\nhair, who was candidate for some North Country constituency. We\r\ndiscussed the political outlook, and, like so many Socialists at that\r\ntime, he was full of vague threatenings against the Liberal party. I\r\nwas struck by a thing in him that I had already observed less vividly in\r\nmany others of these Socialist leaders, and which gave me at last a clue\r\nto the whole business. He behaved exactly like a man in possession of\r\nvaluable patent rights, who wants to be dealt with. He had an air of\r\nhaving a corner in ideas. Then it flashed into my head that the whole\r\nSocialist movement was an attempted corner in ideas....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\n\r\nLate that night I found myself alone with Margaret amid the debris of\r\nthe gathering.\r\n\r\nI sat before the fire, hands in pockets, and Margaret, looking white and\r\nweary, came and leant upon the mantel.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Lord!” said Margaret.\r\n\r\nI agreed. Then I resumed my meditation.\r\n\r\n“Ideas,” I said, “count for more than I thought in the world.”\r\n\r\nMargaret regarded me with that neutral expression behind which she was\r\naccustomed to wait for clues.\r\n\r\n“When you think of the height and depth and importance and wisdom of the\r\nSocialist ideas, and see the men who are running them,” I explained....\r\n“A big system of ideas like Socialism grows up out of the obvious common\r\nsense of our present conditions. It's as impersonal as science. All\r\nthese men--They've given nothing to it. They're just people who have\r\npegged out claims upon a big intellectual No-Man's-Land--and don't feel\r\nquite sure of the law. There's a sort of quarrelsome uneasiness....\r\nIf we professed Socialism do you think they'd welcome us? Not a man of\r\nthem! They'd feel it was burglary....”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Margaret, looking into the fire. “That is just what I felt\r\nabout them all the evening.... Particularly Dr. Tumpany.”\r\n\r\n“We mustn't confuse Socialism with the Socialists,” I said; “that's\r\nthe moral of it. I suppose if God were to find He had made a mistake in\r\ndates or something, and went back and annihilated everybody from Owen\r\nonwards who was in any way known as a Socialist leader or teacher,\r\nSocialism would be exactly where it is and what it is to-day--a growing\r\nrealisation of constructive needs in every man's mind, and a little\r\ncorner in party politics. So, I suppose, it will always be.... But they\r\nWERE a damned lot, Margaret!”\r\n\r\nI looked up at the little noise she made. “TWICE!” she said, smiling\r\nindulgently, “to-day!” (Even the smile was Altiora's.)\r\n\r\nI returned to my thoughts. They WERE a damned human lot. It was an\r\nexcellent word in that connection....\r\n\r\nBut the ideas marched on, the ideas marched on, just as though men's\r\nbrains were no more than stepping-stones, just as though some great\r\nbrain in which we are all little cells and corpuscles was thinking\r\nthem!...\r\n\r\n“I don't think there is a man among them who makes me feel he is\r\ntrustworthy,” said Margaret; “unless it is Featherstonehaugh.”\r\n\r\nI sat taking in this proposition.\r\n\r\n“They'll never help us, I feel,” said Margaret.\r\n\r\n“Us?”\r\n\r\n“The Liberals.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, damn the Liberals!” I said. “They'll never even help themselves.”\r\n\r\n“I don't think I could possibly get on with any of those people,” said\r\nMargaret, after a pause.\r\n\r\nShe remained for a time looking down at me and, I could feel, perplexed\r\nby me, but I wanted to go on with my thinking, and so I did not look up,\r\nand presently she stooped to my forehead and kissed me and went rustling\r\nsoftly to her room.\r\n\r\nI remained in my study for a long time with my thoughts crystallising\r\nout....\r\n\r\nIt was then, I think, that I first apprehended clearly how that\r\nopposition to which I have already alluded of the immediate life and the\r\nmental hinterland of a man, can be applied to public and social affairs.\r\nThe ideas go on--and no person or party succeeds in embodying them. The\r\nreality of human progress never comes to the surface, it is a power\r\nin the deeps, an undertow. It goes on in silence while men think, in\r\nstudies where they write self-forgetfully, in laboratories under the\r\nurgency of an impersonal curiosity, in the rare illumination of honest\r\ntalk, in moments of emotional insight, in thoughtful reading, but not\r\nin everyday affairs. Everyday affairs and whatever is made an everyday\r\naffair, are transactions of the ostensible self, the being of habits,\r\ninterests, usage. Temper, vanity, hasty reaction to imitation, personal\r\nfeeling, are their substance. No man can abolish his immediate self and\r\nspecialise in the depths; if he attempt that, he simply turns himself\r\ninto something a little less than the common man. He may have an immense\r\nhinterland, but that does not absolve him from a frontage. That is the\r\nessential error of the specialist philosopher, the specialist teacher,\r\nthe specialist publicist. They repudiate frontage; claim to be pure\r\nhinterland. That is what bothered me about Codger, about those various\r\nschoolmasters who had prepared me for life, about the Baileys and their\r\ndream of an official ruling class. A human being who is a philosopher\r\nin the first place, a teacher in the first place, or a statesman in the\r\nfirst place, is thereby and inevitably, though he bring God-like gifts\r\nto the pretence--a quack. These are attempts to live deep-side\r\nshallow, inside out. They produce merely a new pettiness. To understand\r\nSocialism, again, is to gain a new breadth of outlook; to join a\r\nSocialist organisation is to join a narrow cult which is not even\r\ntolerably serviceable in presenting or spreading the ideas for which it\r\nstands....\r\n\r\nI perceived I had got something quite fundamental here. It had taken me\r\nsome years to realise the true relation of the great constructive ideas\r\nthat swayed me not only to political parties, but to myself. I had\r\nbeen disposed to identify the formulae of some one party with social\r\nconstruction, and to regard the other as necessarily anti-constructive,\r\njust as I had been inclined to follow the Baileys in the\r\nself-righteousness of supposing myself to be wholly constructive. But I\r\nsaw now that every man of intellectual freedom and vigour is necessarily\r\nconstructive-minded nowadays, and that no man is disinterestedly so.\r\nEach one of us repeats in himself the conflict of the race between the\r\nsplendour of its possibilities and its immediate associations. We may be\r\nshaping immortal things, but we must sleep and answer the dinner gong,\r\nand have our salt of flattery and self-approval. In politics a man\r\ncounts not for what he is in moments of imaginative expansion, but\r\nfor his common workaday, selfish self; and political parties are held\r\ntogether not by a community of ultimate aims, but by the stabler bond\r\nof an accustomed life. Everybody almost is for progress in general, and\r\nnearly everybody is opposed to any change, except in so far as gross\r\nincrements are change, in his particular method of living and behaviour.\r\nEvery party stands essentially for the interests and mental usages of\r\nsome definite class or group of classes in the exciting community, and\r\nevery party has its scientific-minded and constructive leading section,\r\nwith well-defined hinterlands formulating its social functions in a\r\npublic-spirited form, and its superficial-minded following confessing\r\nits meannesses and vanities and prejudices. No class will abolish\r\nitself, materially alter its way of life, or drastically reconstruct\r\nitself, albeit no class is indisposed to co-operate in the unlimited\r\nsocialisation of any other class. In that capacity for aggression upon\r\nother classes lies the essential driving force of modern affairs. The\r\ninstincts, the persons, the parties, and vanities sway and struggle.\r\nThe ideas and understandings march on and achieve themselves for all--in\r\nspite of every one....\r\n\r\nThe methods and traditions of British politics maintain the form of two\r\ngreat parties, with rider groups seeking to gain specific ends in the\r\nevent of a small Government majority. These two main parties are more or\r\nless heterogeneous in composition. Each, however, has certain necessary\r\ncharacteristics. The Conservative Party has always stood quite\r\ndefinitely for the established propertied interests. The land-owner,\r\nthe big lawyer, the Established Church, and latterly the huge private\r\nmonopoly of the liquor trade which has been created by temperance\r\nlegislation, are the essential Conservatives. Interwoven now with the\r\nnative wealthy are the families of the great international usurers, and\r\na vast miscellaneous mass of financial enterprise. Outside the range of\r\nresistance implied by these interests, the Conservative Party has always\r\nshown itself just as constructive and collectivist as any other party.\r\nThe great landowners have been as well-disposed towards the endowment\r\nof higher education, and as willing to co-operate with the Church in\r\nprotective and mildly educational legislation for children and the\r\nworking class, as any political section. The financiers, too, are\r\nadventurous-spirited and eager for mechanical progress and technical\r\nefficiency. They are prepared to spend public money upon research,\r\nupon ports and harbours and public communications, upon sanitation and\r\nhygienic organisation. A certain rude benevolence of public intention is\r\nequally characteristic of the liquor trade. Provided his comfort leads\r\nto no excesses of temperance, the liquor trade is quite eager to see\r\nthe common man prosperous, happy, and with money to spend in a bar. All\r\nsections of the party are aggressively patriotic and favourably inclined\r\nto the idea of an upstanding, well-fed, and well-exercised population\r\nin uniform. Of course there are reactionary landowners and old-fashioned\r\ncountry clergy, full of localised self-importance, jealous even of the\r\ncottager who can read, but they have neither the power nor the ability\r\nto retard the constructive forces in the party as a whole. On the other\r\nhand, when matters point to any definitely confiscatory proposal, to the\r\npublic ownership and collective control of land, for example, or\r\nstate mining and manufactures, or the nationalisation of the so-called\r\npublic-house or extended municipal enterprise, or even to an increase of\r\nthe taxation of property, then the Conservative Party presents a nearly\r\nadamantine bar. It does not stand for, it IS, the existing arrangement\r\nin these affairs.\r\n\r\nEven more definitely a class party is the Labour Party, whose immediate\r\ninterest is to raise wages, shorten hours of labor, increase employment,\r\nand make better terms for the working-man tenant and working-man\r\npurchaser. Its leaders are no doubt constructive minded, but the mass\r\nof the following is naturally suspicious of education and discipline,\r\nhostile to the higher education, and--except for an obvious antagonism\r\nto employers and property owners--almost destitute of ideas. What\r\nelse can it be? It stands for the expropriated multitude, whose whole\r\nsituation and difficulty arise from its individual lack of initiative\r\nand organising power. It favours the nationalisation of land and capital\r\nwith no sense of the difficulties involved in the process; but, on the\r\nother hand, the equally reasonable socialisation of individuals which\r\nis implied by military service is steadily and quite naturally and quite\r\nillogically opposed by it. It is only in recent years that Labour has\r\nemerged as a separate party from the huge hospitable caravanserai of\r\nLiberalism, and there is still a very marked tendency to step back again\r\ninto that multitudinous assemblage.\r\n\r\nFor multitudinousness has always been the Liberal characteristic.\r\nLiberalism never has been nor ever can be anything but a diversified\r\ncrowd. Liberalism has to voice everything that is left out by these\r\nother parties. It is the party against the predominating interests. It\r\nis at once the party of the failing and of the untried; it is the party\r\nof decadence and hope. From its nature it must be a vague and planless\r\nassociation in comparison with its antagonist, neither so constructive\r\non the one hand, nor on the other so competent to hinder the inevitable\r\nconstructions of the civilised state. Essentially it is the party\r\nof criticism, the “Anti” party. It is a system of hostilities and\r\nobjections that somehow achieves at times an elusive common soul. It is\r\na gathering together of all the smaller interests which find themselves\r\nat a disadvantage against the big established classes, the leasehold\r\ntenant as against the landowner, the retail tradesman as against\r\nthe merchant and the moneylender, the Nonconformist as against the\r\nChurchman, the small employer as against the demoralising hospitable\r\npublican, the man without introductions and broad connections against\r\nthe man who has these things. It is the party of the many small men\r\nagainst the fewer prevailing men. It has no more essential reason for\r\nloving the Collectivist state than the Conservatives; the small dealer\r\nis doomed to absorption in that just as much as the large owner; but\r\nit resorts to the state against its antagonists as in the middle ages\r\ncommon men pitted themselves against the barons by siding with the king.\r\nThe Liberal Party is the party against “class privilege” because it\r\nrepresents no class advantages, but it is also the party that is on\r\nthe whole most set against Collective control because it represents\r\nno established responsibility. It is constructive only so far as its\r\nantagonism to the great owner is more powerful than its jealousy of the\r\nstate. It organises only because organisation is forced upon it by the\r\norganisation of its adversaries. It lapses in and out of alliance with\r\nLabour as it sways between hostility to wealth and hostility to public\r\nexpenditure....\r\n\r\nEvery modern European state will have in some form or other these three\r\nparties: the resistent, militant, authoritative, dull, and unsympathetic\r\nparty of establishment and success, the rich party; the confused,\r\nsentimental, spasmodic, numerous party of the small, struggling,\r\nvarious, undisciplined men, the poor man's party; and a third party\r\nsometimes detaching itself from the second and sometimes reuniting with\r\nit, the party of the altogether expropriated masses, the proletarians,\r\nLabour. Change Conservative and Liberal to Republican and Democrat, for\r\nexample, and you have the conditions in the United States. The Crown or\r\na dethroned dynasty, the Established Church or a dispossessed church,\r\nnationalist secessions, the personalities of party leaders, may break\r\nup, complicate, and confuse the self-expression of these three necessary\r\ndivisions in the modern social drama, the analyst will make them out\r\nnone the less for that....\r\n\r\nAnd then I came back as if I came back to a refrain;--the ideas go\r\non--as though we are all no more than little cells and corpuscles in\r\nsome great brain beyond our understanding....\r\n\r\nSo it was I sat and thought my problem out.... I still remember my\r\nsatisfaction at seeing things plainly at last. It was like clouds\r\ndispersing to show the sky. Constructive ideas, of course, couldn't hold\r\na party together alone, “interests and habits, not ideas,” I had that\r\nnow, and so the great constructive scheme of Socialism, invading and\r\ninspiring all parties, was necessarily claimed only by this collection\r\nof odds and ends, this residuum of disconnected and exceptional people.\r\nThis was true not only of the Socialist idea, but of the scientific\r\nidea, the idea of veracity--of human confidence in humanity--of all that\r\nmattered in human life outside the life of individuals.... The only real\r\nparty that would ever profess Socialism was the Labour Party, and that\r\nin the entirely one-sided form of an irresponsible and non-constructive\r\nattack on property. Socialism in that mutilated form, the teeth and\r\nclaws without the eyes and brain, I wanted as little as I wanted\r\nanything in the world.\r\n\r\nPerfectly clear it was, perfectly clear, and why hadn't I seen it\r\nbefore?... I looked at my watch, and it was half-past two.\r\n\r\nI yawned, stretched, got up and went to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\n\r\nMy ideas about statecraft have passed through three main phases to the\r\nfinal convictions that remain. There was the first immediacy of my dream\r\nof ports and harbours and cities, railways, roads, and administered\r\nterritories--the vision I had seen in the haze from that little church\r\nabove Locarno. Slowly that had passed into a more elaborate legislative\r\nconstructiveness, which had led to my uneasy association with the\r\nBaileys and the professedly constructive Young Liberals. To get that\r\nordered life I had realised the need of organisation, knowledge,\r\nexpertness, a wide movement of co-ordinated methods. On the individual\r\nside I thought that a life of urgent industry, temperance, and close\r\nattention was indicated by my perception of these ends. I married\r\nMargaret and set to work. But something in my mind refused from the\r\noutset to accept these determinations as final. There was always a doubt\r\nlurking below, always a faint resentment, a protesting criticism, a\r\nfeeling of vitally important omissions.\r\n\r\nI arrived at last at the clear realisation that my political associates,\r\nand I in my association with them, were oddly narrow, priggish, and\r\nunreal, that the Socialists with whom we were attempting co-operation\r\nwere preposterously irrelevant to their own theories, that my political\r\nlife didn't in some way comprehend more than itself, that rather\r\nperplexingly I was missing the thing I was seeking. Britten's footnotes\r\nto Altiora's self-assertions, her fits of energetic planning, her\r\nquarrels and rallies and vanities, his illuminating attacks on\r\nCramptonism and the heavy-spirited triviality of such Liberalism as the\r\nChildren's Charter, served to point my way to my present conclusions.\r\nI had been trying to deal all along with human progress as something\r\nimmediate in life, something to be immediately attacked by political\r\nparties and groups pointing primarily to that end. I now began to\r\nsee that just as in my own being there was the rather shallow, rather\r\nvulgar, self-seeking careerist, who wore an admirable silk hat and\r\nbustled self-consciously through the lobby, and a much greater and\r\nindefinitely growing unpublished personality behind him--my hinterland,\r\nI have called it--so in human affairs generally the permanent reality\r\nis also a hinterland, which is never really immediate, which draws\r\ncontinually upon human experience and influences human action more and\r\nmore, but which is itself never the actual player upon the stage. It is\r\nthe unseen dramatist who never takes a call. Now it was just through the\r\nfact that our group about the Baileys didn't understand this, that with\r\na sort of frantic energy they were trying to develop that sham expert\r\nofficialdom of theirs to plan, regulate, and direct the affairs of\r\nhumanity, that the perplexing note of silliness and shallowness that I\r\nhad always felt and felt now most acutely under Britten's gibes, came\r\nin. They were neglecting human life altogether in social organisation.\r\n\r\nIn the development of intellectual modesty lies the growth of\r\nstatesmanship. It has been the chronic mistake of statecraft and all\r\norganising spirits to attempt immediately to scheme and arrange and\r\nachieve. Priests, schools of thought, political schemers, leaders of\r\nmen, have always slipped into the error of assuming that they can think\r\nout the whole--or at any rate completely think out definite parts--of\r\nthe purpose and future of man, clearly and finally; they have set\r\nthemselves to legislate and construct on that assumption, and,\r\nexperiencing the perplexing obduracy and evasions of reality, they have\r\ntaken to dogma, persecution, training, pruning, secretive education; and\r\nall the stupidities of self-sufficient energy. In the passion of their\r\ngood intentions they have not hesitated to conceal fact, suppress\r\nthought, crush disturbing initiatives and apparently detrimental\r\ndesires. And so it is blunderingly and wastefully, destroying with\r\nthe making, that any extension of social organisation is at present\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\nDirectly, however, this idea of an emancipation from immediacy is\r\ngrasped, directly the dominating importance of this critical, less\r\npersonal, mental hinterland in the individual and of the collective mind\r\nin the race is understood, the whole problem of the statesman and\r\nhis attitude towards politics gain a new significance, and becomes\r\naccessible to a new series of solutions. He wants no longer to “fix\r\nup,” as people say, human affairs, but to devote his forces to the\r\ndevelopment of that needed intellectual life without which all his\r\nshallow attempts at fixing up are futile. He ceases to build on the\r\nsands, and sets himself to gather foundations.\r\n\r\nYou see, I began in my teens by wanting to plan and build cities and\r\nharbours for mankind; I ended in the middle thirties by desiring only\r\nto serve and increase a general process of thought, a process fearless,\r\ncritical, real-spirited, that would in its own time give cities,\r\nharbours, air, happiness, everything at a scale and quality and in\r\na light altogether beyond the match-striking imaginations of a\r\ncontemporary mind. I wanted freedom of speech and suggestion, vigour of\r\nthought, and the cultivation of that impulse of veracity that lurks\r\nmore or less discouraged in every man. With that I felt there must go an\r\nemotion. I hit upon a phrase that became at last something of a refrain\r\nin my speech and writings, to convey the spirit that I felt was at the\r\nvery heart of real human progress--love and fine thinking.\r\n\r\n(I suppose that nowadays no newspaper in England gets through a week\r\nwithout the repetition of that phrase.)\r\n\r\nMy convictions crystallised more and more definitely upon this. The\r\nmore of love and fine thinking the better for men, I said; the less,\r\nthe worse. And upon this fresh basis I set myself to examine what I as\r\na politician might do. I perceived I was at last finding an adequate\r\nexpression for all that was in me, for those forces that had rebelled at\r\nthe crude presentations of Bromstead, at the secrecies and suppressions\r\nof my youth, at the dull unrealities of City Merchants, at the\r\nconventions and timidities of the Pinky Dinkys, at the philosophical\r\nrecluse of Trinity and the phrases and tradition-worship of my political\r\nassociates. None of these things were half alive, and I wanted life to\r\nbe intensely alive and awake. I wanted thought like an edge of steel and\r\ndesire like a flame. The real work before mankind now, I realised once\r\nand for all, is the enlargement of human expression, the release and\r\nintensification of human thought, the vivider utilisation of experience\r\nand the invigoration of research--and whatever one does in human affairs\r\nhas or lacks value as it helps or hinders that.\r\n\r\nWith that I had got my problem clear, and the solution, so far as I\r\nwas concerned, lay in finding out the point in the ostensible life of\r\npolitics at which I could most subserve these ends. I was still against\r\nthe muddles of Bromstead, but I had hunted them down now to their\r\nessential form. The jerry-built slums, the roads that went nowhere,\r\nthe tarred fences, litigious notice-boards and barbed wire fencing, the\r\nlitter and the heaps of dump, were only the outward appearances whose\r\nultimate realities were jerry-built conclusions, hasty purposes, aimless\r\nhabits of thought, and imbecile bars and prohibitions in the thoughts\r\nand souls of men. How are we through politics to get at that confusion?\r\n\r\nWe want to invigorate and reinvigorate education. We want to create a\r\nsustained counter effort to the perpetual tendency of all educational\r\norganisations towards classicalism, secondary issues, and the evasion of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWe want to stimulate the expression of life through art and literature,\r\nand its exploration through research.\r\n\r\nWe want to make the best and finest thought accessible to every one,\r\nand more particularly to create and sustain an enormous free criticism,\r\nwithout which art, literature, and research alike degenerate into\r\ntradition or imposture.\r\n\r\nThen all the other problems which are now so insoluble, destitution,\r\ndisease, the difficulty of maintaining international peace, the scarcely\r\nfaced possibility of making life generally and continually beautiful,\r\nbecome--EASY....\r\n\r\nIt was clear to me that the most vital activities in which I could\r\nengage would be those which most directly affected the Church, public\r\nhabits of thought, education, organised research, literature, and the\r\nchannels of general discussion. I had to ask myself how my position\r\nas Liberal member for Kinghamstead squared with and conduced to this\r\nessential work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE SECOND ~~ SEEKING ASSOCIATES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nI have told of my gradual abandonment of the pretensions and habits of\r\nparty Liberalism. In a sense I was moving towards aristocracy. Regarding\r\nthe development of the social and individual mental hinterland as the\r\nessential thing in human progress, I passed on very naturally to the\r\npractical assumption that we wanted what I may call “hinterlanders.” Of\r\ncourse I do not mean by aristocracy the changing unorganised medley of\r\nrich people and privileged people who dominate the civilised world of\r\nto-day, but as opposed to this, a possibility of co-ordinating the will\r\nof the finer individuals, by habit and literature, into a broad common\r\naim. We must have an aristocracy--not of privilege, but of understanding\r\nand purpose--or mankind will fail. I find this dawning more and more\r\nclearly when I look through my various writings of the years between\r\n1903 and 1910. I was already emerging to plain statements in 1908.\r\n\r\nI reasoned after this fashion. The line of human improvement and the\r\nexpansion of human life lies in the direction of education and finer\r\ninitiatives. If humanity cannot develop an education far beyond anything\r\nthat is now provided, if it cannot collectively invent devices and solve\r\nproblems on a much richer, broader scale than it does at the present\r\ntime, it cannot hope to achieve any very much finer order or any more\r\ngeneral happiness than it now enjoys. We must believe, therefore, that\r\nit CAN develop such a training and education, or we must abandon secular\r\nconstructive hope. And here my peculiar difficulty as against crude\r\ndemocracy comes in. If humanity at large is capable of that high\r\neducation and those creative freedoms our hope demands, much more must\r\nits better and more vigorous types be so capable. And if those who have\r\npower and leisure now, and freedom to respond to imaginative appeals,\r\ncannot be won to the idea of collective self-development, then the whole\r\nof humanity cannot be won to that. From that one passes to what\r\nhas become my general conception in politics, the conception of the\r\nconstructive imagination working upon the vast complex of powerful\r\npeople, clever people, enterprising people, influential people, amidst\r\nwhom power is diffused to-day, to produce that self-conscious, highly\r\nselective, open-minded, devoted aristocratic culture, which seems to me\r\nto be the necessary next phase in the development of human affairs.\r\nI see human progress, not as the spontaneous product of crowds of raw\r\nminds swayed by elementary needs, but as a natural but elaborate result\r\nof intricate human interdependencies, of human energy and curiosity\r\nliberated and acting at leisure, of human passions and motives, modified\r\nand redirected by literature and art....\r\n\r\nBut now the reader will understand how it came about that, disappointed\r\nby the essential littleness of Liberalism, and disillusioned about the\r\nrepresentative quality of the professed Socialists, I turned my\r\nmind more and more to a scrutiny of the big people, the wealthy and\r\ninfluential people, against whom Liberalism pits its forces. I was\r\nasking myself definitely whether, after all, it was not my particular\r\njob to work through them and not against them. Was I not altogether out\r\nof my element as an Anti-? Weren't there big bold qualities about these\r\npeople that common men lack, and the possibility of far more splendid\r\ndreams? Were they really the obstacles, might they not be rather the\r\nvehicles of the possible new braveries of life?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\nThe faults of the Imperialist movement were obvious enough. The\r\nconception of the Boer War had been clumsy and puerile, the costly\r\nerrors of that struggle appalling, and the subsequent campaign of Mr.\r\nChamberlain for Tariff Reform seemed calculated to combine the financial\r\nadventurers of the Empire in one vast conspiracy against the consumer.\r\nThe cant of Imperialism was easy to learn and use; it was speedily\r\nadopted by all sorts of base enterprises and turned to all sorts of base\r\nends. But a big child is permitted big mischief, and my mind was\r\nnow continually returning to the persuasion that after all in some\r\ndevelopment of the idea of Imperial patriotism might be found that wide,\r\nrough, politically acceptable expression of a constructive dream capable\r\nof sustaining a great educational and philosophical movement such as\r\nno formula of Liberalism supplied. The fact that it readily took vulgar\r\nforms only witnessed to its strong popular appeal. Mixed in with the\r\nnoisiness and humbug of the movement there appeared a real regard for\r\nsocial efficiency, a real spirit of animation and enterprise. There\r\nsuddenly appeared in my world--I saw them first, I think, in 1908--a\r\nnew sort of little boy, a most agreeable development of the slouching,\r\ncunning, cigarette-smoking, town-bred youngster, a small boy in a khaki\r\nhat, and with bare knees and athletic bearing, earnestly engaged in\r\nwholesome and invigorating games up to and occasionally a little beyond\r\nhis strength--the Boy Scout. I liked the Boy Scout, and I find it\r\ndifficult to express how much it mattered to me, with my growing bias in\r\nfavour of deliberate national training, that Liberalism hadn't been able\r\nto produce, and had indeed never attempted to produce, anything of this\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nIn those days there existed a dining club called--there was some lost\r\nallusion to the exorcism of party feeling in its title--the Pentagram\r\nCircle. It included Bailey and Dayton and myself, Sir Herbert Thorns,\r\nLord Charles Kindling, Minns the poet, Gerbault the big railway man,\r\nLord Gane, fresh from the settlement of Framboya, and Rumbold, who later\r\nbecame Home Secretary and left us. We were men of all parties and very\r\nvarious experiences, and our object was to discuss the welfare of the\r\nEmpire in a disinterested spirit. We dined monthly at the Mermaid in\r\nWestminster, and for a couple of years we kept up an average attendance\r\nof ten out of fourteen. The dinner-time was given up to desultory\r\nconversation, and it is odd how warm and good the social atmosphere of\r\nthat little gathering became as time went on; then over the dessert, so\r\nsoon as the waiters had swept away the crumbs and ceased to fret us, one\r\nof us would open with perhaps fifteen or twenty minutes' exposition\r\nof some specially prepared question, and after him we would deliver\r\nourselves in turn, each for three or four minutes. When every one\r\npresent had spoken once talk became general again, and it was rare we\r\nemerged upon Hendon Street before midnight. Sometimes, as my house\r\nwas conveniently near, a knot of men would come home with me and go on\r\ntalking and smoking in my dining-room until two or three. We had Fred\r\nNeal, that wild Irish journalist, among us towards the end, and his\r\nstupendous flow of words materially prolonged our closing discussions\r\nand made our continuance impossible.\r\n\r\nI learned very much and very many things at those dinners, but more\r\nparticularly did I become familiarised with the habits of mind of such\r\nmen as Neal, Crupp, Gane, and the one or two other New Imperialists\r\nwho belonged to us. They were nearly all like Bailey Oxford men, though\r\nmostly of a younger generation, and they were all mysteriously and\r\ninexplicably advocates of Tariff Reform, as if it were the principal\r\ninstead of at best a secondary aspect of constructive policy. They\r\nseemed obsessed by the idea that streams of trade could be diverted\r\nviolently so as to link the parts of the Empire by common interests, and\r\nthey were persuaded, I still think mistakenly, that Tariff Reform would\r\nhave an immense popular appeal. They were also very keen on military\r\norganisation, and with a curious little martinet twist in their minds\r\nthat boded ill for that side of public liberty. So much against them.\r\nBut they were disposed to spend money much more generously on education\r\nand research of all sorts than our formless host of Liberals seemed\r\nlikely to do; and they were altogether more accessible than the Young\r\nLiberals to bold, constructive ideas affecting the universities and\r\nupper classes. The Liberals are abjectly afraid of the universities.\r\nI found myself constantly falling into line with these men in our\r\ndiscussions, and more and more hostile to Dayton's sentimentalising\r\nevasions of definite schemes and Minns' trust in such things as the\r\n“Spirit of our People” and the “General Trend of Progress.” It wasn't\r\nthat I thought them very much righter than their opponents; I believe\r\nall definite party “sides” at any time are bound to be about equally\r\nright and equally lop-sided; but that I thought I could get more out\r\nof them and what was more important to me, more out of myself if I\r\nco-operated with them. By 1908 I had already arrived at a point where I\r\ncould be definitely considering a transfer of my political allegiance.\r\n\r\nThese abstract questions are inseparably interwoven with my memory of a\r\nshining long white table, and our hock bottles and burgundy bottles, and\r\nbottles of Perrier and St. Galmier and the disturbed central trophy of\r\ndessert, and scattered glasses and nut-shells and cigarette-ends and\r\nmenu-cards used for memoranda. I see old Dayton sitting back and cocking\r\nhis eye to the ceiling in a way he had while he threw warmth into the\r\nancient platitudes of Liberalism, and Minns leaning forward, and a\r\nlittle like a cockatoo with a taste for confidences, telling us in a\r\nhushed voice of his faith in the Destiny of Mankind. Thorns lounges,\r\nrolling his round face and round eyes from speaker to speaker and\r\nsounding the visible depths of misery whenever Neal begins. Gerbault\r\nand Gane were given to conversation in undertones, and Bailey pursued\r\nmysterious purposes in lisping whispers. It was Crupp attracted me most.\r\nHe had, as people say, his eye on me from the beginning. He used to\r\nspeak at me, and drifted into a custom of coming home with me very\r\nregularly for an after-talk.\r\n\r\nHe opened his heart to me.\r\n\r\n“Neither of us,” he said, “are dukes, and neither of us are horny-handed\r\nsons of toil. We want to get hold of the handles, and to do that, one\r\nmust go where the power is, and give it just as constructive a twist as\r\nwe can. That's MY Toryism.”\r\n\r\n“Is it Kindling's--or Gerbault's?”\r\n\r\n“No. But theirs is soft, and mine's hard. Mine will wear theirs out. You\r\nand I and Bailey are all after the same thing, and why aren't we working\r\ntogether?”\r\n\r\n“Are you a Confederate?” I asked suddenly.\r\n\r\n“That's a secret nobody tells,” he said.\r\n\r\n“What are the Confederates after?”\r\n\r\n“Making aristocracy work, I suppose. Just as, I gather, you want to\r\ndo.”...\r\n\r\nThe Confederates were being heard of at that time. They were at once\r\nattractive and repellent to me, an odd secret society whose membership\r\nnobody knew, pledged, it was said, to impose Tariff Reform and an ample\r\nconstructive policy upon the Conservatives. In the press, at any rate,\r\nthey had an air of deliberately organised power. I have no doubt the\r\nrumour of them greatly influenced my ideas....\r\n\r\nIn the end I made some very rapid decisions, but for nearly two years I\r\nwas hesitating. Hesitations were inevitable in such a matter. I was\r\nnot dealing with any simple question of principle, but with elusive and\r\nfluctuating estimates of the trend of diverse forces and of the nature\r\nof my own powers. All through that period I was asking over and over\r\nagain: how far are these Confederates mere dreamers? How far--and this\r\nwas more vital--are they rendering lip-service to social organisations?\r\nIs it true they desire war because it confirms the ascendency of their\r\nclass? How far can Conservatism be induced to plan and construct before\r\nit resists the thrust towards change. Is it really in bulk anything more\r\nthan a mass of prejudice and conceit, cynical indulgence, and a hard\r\nsuspicion of and hostility to the expropriated classes in the community?\r\n\r\nThat is a research which yields no statistics, an enquiry like asking\r\nwhat is the ruling colour of a chameleon. The shadowy answer varied\r\nwith my health, varied with my mood and the conduct of the people I was\r\nwatching. How fine can people be? How generous?--not incidentally, but\r\nall round? How far can you educate sons beyond the outlook of their\r\nfathers, and how far lift a rich, proud, self-indulgent class above the\r\nprotests of its business agents and solicitors and its own habits and\r\nvanity? Is chivalry in a class possible?--was it ever, indeed, or will\r\nit ever indeed be possible? Is the progress that seems attainable in\r\ncertain directions worth the retrogression that may be its price?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was to the Pentagram Circle that I first broached the new conceptions\r\nthat were developing in my mind. I count the evening of my paper the\r\nbeginning of the movement that created the BLUE WEEKLY and our wing of\r\nthe present New Tory party. I do that without any excessive egotism,\r\nbecause my essay was no solitary man's production; it was my reaction\r\nto forces that had come to me very large through my fellow-members; its\r\nquick reception by them showed that I was, so to speak, merely the first\r\nof the chestnuts to pop. The atmospheric quality of the evening stands\r\nout very vividly in my memory. The night, I remember, was warmly foggy\r\nwhen after midnight we went to finish our talk at my house.\r\n\r\nWe had recently changed the rules of the club to admit visitors, and\r\nso it happened that I had brought Britten, and Crupp introduced Arnold\r\nShoesmith, my former schoolfellow at City Merchants, and now the\r\nwealthy successor of his father and elder brother. I remember his heavy,\r\ninexpressively handsome face lighting to his rare smile at the sight of\r\nme, and how little I dreamt of the tragic entanglement that was destined\r\nto involve us both. Gane was present, and Esmeer, a newly-added\r\nmember, but I think Bailey was absent. Either he was absent, or he said\r\nsomething so entirely characteristic and undistinguished that it has\r\nleft no impression on my mind.\r\n\r\nI had broken a little from the traditions of the club even in my title,\r\nwhich was deliberately a challenge to the liberal idea: it was, “The\r\nWorld Exists for Exceptional People.” It is not the title I should\r\nchoose now--for since that time I have got my phrase of “mental\r\nhinterlander” into journalistic use. I should say now, “The World Exists\r\nfor Mental Hinterland.”\r\n\r\nThe notes I made of that opening have long since vanished with a\r\nthousand other papers, but some odd chance has preserved and brought\r\nwith me to Italy the menu for the evening; its back black with the\r\nscrawled notes I made of the discussion for my reply. I found it the\r\nother day among some letters from Margaret and a copy of the 1909 Report\r\nof the Poor Law Commission, also rich with pencilled marginalia.\r\n\r\nMy opening was a criticism of the democratic idea and method, upon lines\r\nsuch as I have already sufficiently indicated in the preceding sections.\r\nI remember how old Dayton fretted in his chair, and tushed and pished\r\nat that, even as I gave it, and afterwards we were treated to one of his\r\nplatitudinous harangues, he sitting back in his chair with that small\r\nobstinate eye of his fixed on the ceiling, and a sort of cadaverous glow\r\nupon his face, repeating--quite regardless of all my reasoning and all\r\nthat had been said by others in the debate--the sacred empty phrases\r\nthat were his soul's refuge from reality. “You may think it very\r\nclever,” he said with a nod of his head to mark his sense of his point,\r\n“not to Trust in the People. I do.” And so on. Nothing in his life or\r\nwork had ever shown that he did trust in the people, but that was\r\nbeside the mark. He was the party Liberal, and these were the party\r\nincantations.\r\n\r\nAfter my preliminary attack on vague democracy I went on to show that\r\nall human life was virtually aristocratic; people must either recognise\r\naristocracy in general or else follow leaders, which is aristocracy in\r\nparticular, and so I came to my point that the reality of human progress\r\nlay necessarily through the establishment of freedoms for the human best\r\nand a collective receptivity and understanding. There was a disgusted\r\ngrunt from Dayton, “Superman rubbish--Nietzsche. Shaw! Ugh!” I sailed on\r\nover him to my next propositions. The prime essential in a progressive\r\ncivilisation was the establishment of a more effective selective process\r\nfor the privilege of higher education, and the very highest educational\r\nopportunity for the educable. We were too apt to patronise scholarship\r\nwinners, as though a scholarship was toffee given as a reward for\r\nvirtue. It wasn't any reward at all; it was an invitation to capacity.\r\nWe had no more right to drag in virtue, or any merit but quality, than\r\nwe had to involve it in a search for the tallest man. We didn't want a\r\nmere process for the selection of good as distinguished from gifted and\r\nable boys--“No, you DON'T,” from Dayton--we wanted all the brilliant\r\nstuff in the world concentrated upon the development of the world.\r\nJust to exasperate Dayton further I put in a plea for gifts as against\r\ncharacter in educational, artistic, and legislative work. “Good\r\nteaching,” I said, “is better than good conduct. We are becoming idiotic\r\nabout character.”\r\n\r\nDayton was too moved to speak. He slewed round upon me an eye of\r\nagonised aversion.\r\n\r\nI expatiated on the small proportion of the available ability that is\r\nreally serving humanity to-day. “I suppose to-day all the thought, all\r\nthe art, all the increments of knowledge that matter, are supplied so\r\nfar as the English-speaking community is concerned by--how many?--by\r\nthree or four thousand individuals. ['Less,' said Thorns.) To be\r\nmore precise, by the mental hinterlands of three or four thousand\r\nindividuals. We who know some of the band entertain no illusions as to\r\ntheir innate rarity. We know that they are just the few out of many, the\r\nfew who got in our world of chance and confusion, the timely stimulus,\r\nthe apt suggestion at the fortunate moment, the needed training, the\r\nleisure. The rest are lost in the crowd, fail through the defects of\r\ntheir qualities, become commonplace workmen and second-rate professional\r\nmen, marry commonplace wives, are as much waste as the driftage of\r\nsuperfluous pollen in a pine forest is waste.”\r\n\r\n“Decent honest lives!” said Dayton to his bread-crumbs, with his chin in\r\nhis necktie. “WASTE!”\r\n\r\n“And the people who do get what we call opportunity get it usually\r\nin extremely limited and cramping forms. No man lives a life of\r\nintellectual productivity alone; he needs not only material and\r\nopportunity, but helpers, resonators. Round and about what I might\r\ncall the REAL men, you want the sympathetic cooperators, who help by\r\nunderstanding. It isn't that our--SALT of three or four thousand is\r\nneedlessly rare; it is sustained by far too small and undifferentiated a\r\npublic. Most of the good men we know are not really doing the very\r\nbest work of their gifts; nearly all are a little adapted, most are\r\nshockingly adapted to some second-best use. Now, I take it, this is the\r\nvery centre and origin of the muddle, futility, and unhappiness that\r\ndistresses us; it's the cardinal problem of the state--to discover,\r\ndevelop, and use the exceptional gifts of men. And I see that best\r\ndone--I drift more and more away from the common stuff of legislative\r\nand administrative activity--by a quite revolutionary development of the\r\neducational machinery, but by a still more unprecedented attempt to\r\nkeep science going, to keep literature going, and to keep what is\r\nthe necessary spur of all science and literature, an intelligent and\r\nappreciative criticism going. You know none of these things have ever\r\nbeen kept going hitherto; they've come unexpectedly and inexplicably.”\r\n\r\n“Hear, hear!” from Dayton, cough, nodding of the head, and an expression\r\nof mystical profundity.\r\n\r\n“They've lit up a civilisation and vanished, to give place to darkness\r\nagain. Now the modern state doesn't mean to go back to darkness\r\nagain--and so it's got to keep its light burning.” I went on to attack\r\nthe present organisation of our schools and universities, which\r\nseemed elaborately designed to turn the well-behaved, uncritical, and\r\nuncreative men of each generation into the authoritative leaders of the\r\nnext, and I suggested remedies upon lines that I have already indicated\r\nin the earlier chapters of this story....\r\n\r\nSo far I had the substance of the club with me, but I opened new\r\nground and set Crupp agog by confessing my doubt from which party or\r\ncombination of groups these developments of science and literature and\r\neducational organisation could most reasonably be expected. I looked up\r\nto find Crupp's dark little eye intent upon me.\r\n\r\nThere I left it to them.\r\n\r\nWe had an astonishingly good discussion; Neal burst once, but we emerged\r\nfrom his flood after a time, and Dayton had his interlude. The rest was\r\nall close, keen examination of my problem.\r\n\r\nI see Crupp now with his arm bent before him on the table in a way we\r\nhad, as though it was jointed throughout its length like a lobster's\r\nantenna, his plump, short-fingered hand crushing up a walnut shell into\r\nsmaller and smaller fragments. “Remington,” he said, “has given us the\r\ndata for a movement, a really possible movement. It's not only possible,\r\nbut necessary--urgently necessary, I think, if the Empire is to go on.”\r\n\r\n“We're working altogether too much at the social basement in education\r\nand training,” said Gane. “Remington is right about our neglect of the\r\nhigher levels.”\r\n\r\nBritten made a good contribution with an analysis of what he called the\r\nspirit of a country and what made it. “The modern community needs its\r\nserious men to be artistic and its artists to be taken seriously,” I\r\nremember his saying. “The day has gone by for either dull responsibility\r\nor merely witty art.”\r\n\r\nI remember very vividly how Shoesmith harped on an idea I had thrown out\r\nof using some sort of review or weekly to express and elaborate these\r\nconceptions of a new, severer, aristocratic culture.\r\n\r\n“It would have to be done amazingly well,” said Britten, and my mind\r\nwent back to my school days and that ancient enterprise of ours, and how\r\nCossington had rushed it. Well, Cossington had too many papers nowadays\r\nto interfere with us, and we perhaps had learnt some defensive devices.\r\n\r\n“But this thing has to be linked to some political party,” said Crupp,\r\nwith his eye on me. “You can't get away from that. The Liberals,” he\r\nadded, “have never done anything for research or literature.”\r\n\r\n“They had a Royal Commission on the Dramatic Censorship,” said Thorns,\r\nwith a note of minute fairness. “It shows what they were made of,” he\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n“It's what I've told Remington again and again,” said Crupp, “we've\r\ngot to pick up the tradition of aristocracy, reorganise it, and make it\r\nwork. But he's certainly suggested a method.”\r\n\r\n“There won't be much aristocracy to pick up,” said Dayton, darkly to the\r\nceiling, “if the House of Lords throws out the Budget.”\r\n\r\n“All the more reason for picking it up,” said Neal. “For we can't do\r\nwithout it.”\r\n\r\n“Will they go to the bad, or will they rise from the ashes, aristocrats\r\nindeed--if the Liberals come in overwhelmingly?” said Britten.\r\n\r\n“It's we who might decide that,” said Crupp, insidiously.\r\n\r\n“I agree,” said Gane.\r\n\r\n“No one can tell,” said Thorns. “I doubt if they will get beaten.”\r\n\r\nIt was an odd, fragmentary discussion that night. We were all with ideas\r\nin our minds at once fine and imperfect. We threw out suggestions that\r\nshowed themselves at once far inadequate, and we tried to qualify them\r\nby minor self-contradictions. Britten, I think, got more said than any\r\none. “You all seem to think you want to organise people, particular\r\ngroups and classes of individuals,” he insisted. “It isn't that. That's\r\nthe standing error of politicians. You want to organise a culture.\r\nCivilisation isn't a matter of concrete groupings; it's a matter of\r\nprevailing ideas. The problem is how to make bold, clear ideas prevail.\r\nThe question for Remington and us is just what groups of people will\r\nmost help this culture forward.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but how are the Lords going to behave?” said Crupp. “You yourself\r\nwere asking that a little while ago.”\r\n\r\n“If they win or if they lose,” Gane maintained, “there will be a\r\nmovement to reorganise aristocracy--Reform of the House of Lords,\r\nthey'll call the political form of it.”\r\n\r\n“Bailey thinks that,” said some one.\r\n\r\n“The labour people want abolition,” said some one. “Let 'em,” said\r\nThorns.\r\n\r\nHe became audible, sketching a possibility of action.\r\n\r\n“Suppose all of us were able to work together. It's just one of those\r\nindeterminate, confused, eventful times ahead when a steady jet of ideas\r\nmight produce enormous results.”\r\n\r\n“Leave me out of it,” said Dayton, “IF you please.”\r\n\r\n“We should,” said Thorns under his breath.\r\n\r\nI took up Crupp's initiative, I remember, and expanded it.\r\n\r\n“I believe we could do--extensive things,” I insisted.\r\n\r\n“Revivals and revisions of Toryism have been tried so often,” said\r\nThorns, “from the Young England movement onward.”\r\n\r\n“Not one but has produced its enduring effects,” I said. “It's the\r\npeculiarity of English conservatism that it's persistently progressive\r\nand rejuvenescent.”\r\n\r\nI think it must have been about that point that Dayton fled our\r\npresence, after some clumsy sentence that I decided upon reflection was\r\nintended to remind me of my duty to my party.\r\n\r\nThen I remember Thorns firing doubts at me obliquely across the table.\r\n“You can't run a country through its spoilt children,” he said. “What\r\nyou call aristocrats are really spoilt children. They've had too much of\r\neverything, except bracing experience.”\r\n\r\n“Children can always be educated,” said Crupp.\r\n\r\n“I said SPOILT children,” said Thorns.\r\n\r\n“Look here, Thorns!” said I. “If this Budget row leads to a storm, and\r\nthese big people get their power clipped, what's going to happen? Have\r\nyou thought of that? When they go out lock, stock, and barrel, who comes\r\nin?”\r\n\r\n“Nature abhors a Vacuum,” said Crupp, supporting me.\r\n\r\n“Bailey's trained officials,” suggested Gane.\r\n\r\n“Quacks with a certificate of approval from Altiora,” said Thorns. “I\r\nadmit the horrors of the alternative. There'd be a massacre in three\r\nyears.”\r\n\r\n“One may go on trying possibilities for ever,” I said. “One thing\r\nemerges. Whatever accidents happen, our civilisation needs, and almost\r\nconsciously needs, a culture of fine creative minds, and all the\r\nnecessary tolerances, opennesses, considerations, that march with that.\r\nFor my own part, I think that is the Most Vital Thing. Build your ship\r\nof state as you will; get your men as you will; I concentrate on what is\r\nclearly the affair of my sort of man,--I want to ensure the quality of\r\nthe quarter deck.”\r\n\r\n“Hear, hear!” said Shoesmith, suddenly--his first remark for a long\r\ntime. “A first-rate figure,” said Shoesmith, gripping it.\r\n\r\n“Our danger is in missing that,” I went on. “Muddle isn't ended by\r\ntransferring power from the muddle-headed few to the muddle-headed\r\nmany, and then cheating the many out of it again in the interests of\r\na bureaucracy of sham experts. But that seems the limit of the liberal\r\nimagination. There is no real progress in a country, except a rise\r\nin the level of its free intellectual activity. All other progress is\r\nsecondary and dependant. If you take on Bailey's dreams of efficient\r\nmachinery and a sort of fanatical discipline with no free-moving brains\r\nbehind it, confused ugliness becomes rigid ugliness,--that's all.\r\nNo doubt things are moving from looseness to discipline, and from\r\nirresponsible controls to organised controls--and also and rather\r\ncontrariwise everything is becoming as people say, democratised; but\r\nall the more need in that, for an ark in which the living element may be\r\nsaved.”\r\n\r\n“Hear, hear!” said Shoesmith, faint but pursuing.\r\n\r\nIt must have been in my house afterwards that Shoesmith became\r\nnoticeable. He seemed trying to say something vague and difficult that\r\nhe didn't get said at all on that occasion. “We could do immense things\r\nwith a weekly,” he repeated, echoing Neal, I think. And there he left\r\noff and became a mute expressiveness, and it was only afterwards, when I\r\nwas in bed, that I saw we had our capitalist in our hands....\r\n\r\nWe parted that night on my doorstep in a tremendous glow--but in that\r\nsort of glow one doesn't act upon without much reconsideration, and it\r\nwas some months before I made my decision to follow up the indications\r\nof that opening talk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\nI find my thoughts lingering about the Pentagram Circle. In my\r\ndevelopments it played a large part, not so much by starting new trains\r\nof thought as by confirming the practicability of things I had already\r\nhesitatingly entertained. Discussion with these other men so prominently\r\ninvolved in current affairs endorsed views that otherwise would have\r\nseemed only a little less remote from actuality than the guardians of\r\nPlato or the labour laws of More. Among other questions that were never\r\nvery distant from our discussions, that came apt to every topic, was\r\nthe true significance of democracy, Tariff Reform as a method of\r\ninternational hostility, and the imminence of war. On the first issue\r\nI can still recall little Bailey, glib and winking, explaining that\r\ndemocracy was really just a dodge for getting assent to the ordinances\r\nof the expert official by means of the polling booth. “If they don't\r\nlike things,” said he, “they can vote for the opposition candidate\r\nand see what happens then--and that, you see, is why we don't want\r\nproportional representation to let in the wild men.” I opened my\r\neyes--the lids had dropped for a moment under the caress of those smooth\r\nsounds--to see if Bailey's artful forefinger wasn't at the side of his\r\npredominant nose.\r\n\r\nThe international situation exercised us greatly. Our meetings were\r\npervaded by the feeling that all things moved towards a day of\r\nreckoning with Germany, and I was largely instrumental in keeping up\r\nthe suggestion that India was in a state of unstable equilibrium, that\r\nsooner or later something must happen there--something very serious to\r\nour Empire. Dayton frankly detested these topics. He was full of\r\nthat old Middle Victorian persuasion that whatever is inconvenient or\r\ndisagreeable to the English mind could be annihilated by not thinking\r\nabout it. He used to sit low in his chair and look mulish. “Militarism,”\r\n he would declare in a tone of the utmost moral fervour, “is a curse.\r\nIt's an unmitigated curse.” Then he would cough shortly and twitch his\r\nhead back and frown, and seem astonished beyond measure that after this\r\nconclusive statement we could still go on talking of war.\r\n\r\nAll our Imperialists were obsessed by the thought of international\r\nconflict, and their influence revived for a time those uneasinesses that\r\nhad been aroused in me for the first time by my continental journey\r\nwith Willersley and by Meredith's “One of Our Conquerors.” That\r\nquite justifiable dread of a punishment for all the slackness, mental\r\ndishonesty, presumption, mercenary respectability and sentimentalised\r\ncommercialism of the Victorian period, at the hands of the better\r\norganised, more vigorous, and now far more highly civilised peoples\r\nof Central Europe, seemed to me to have both a good and bad series of\r\nconsequences. It seemed the only thing capable of bracing English minds\r\nto education, sustained constructive effort and research; but on the\r\nother hand it produced the quality of a panic, hasty preparation,\r\nimpatience of thought, a wasteful and sometimes quite futile immediacy.\r\nIn 1909, for example, there was a vast clamour for eight additional\r\nDreadnoughts--\r\n\r\n     “We want eight\r\n      And we won't wait,”\r\n\r\nbut no clamour at all about our national waste of inventive talent, our\r\nmean standard of intellectual attainment, our disingenuous criticism,\r\nand the consequent failure to distinguish men of the quality needed to\r\ncarry on the modern type of war. Almost universally we have the wrong\r\nmen in our places of responsibility and the right men in no place\r\nat all, almost universally we have poorly qualified, hesitating, and\r\nresentful subordinates, because our criticism is worthless and, so\r\nhabitually as to be now almost unconsciously, dishonest. Germany is\r\nbeating England in every matter upon which competition is possible,\r\nbecause she attended sedulously to her collective mind for sixty\r\npregnant years, because in spite of tremendous defects she is still far\r\nmore anxious for quality in achievement than we are. I remember saying\r\nthat in my paper. From that, I remember, I went on to an image that had\r\nflashed into my mind. “The British Empire,” I said, “is like some of\r\nthose early vertebrated monsters, the Brontosaurus and the Atlantosaurus\r\nand such-like; it sacrifices intellect to character; its backbone,\r\nthat is to say,--especially in the visceral region--is bigger than its\r\ncranium. It's no accident that things are so. We've worked for backbone.\r\nWe brag about backbone, and if the joints are anchylosed so much the\r\nbetter. We're still but only half awake to our error. You can't change\r\nthat suddenly.”\r\n\r\n“Turn it round and make it go backwards,” interjected Thorns.\r\n\r\n“It's trying to do that,” I said, “in places.”\r\n\r\nAnd afterwards Crupp declared I had begotten a nightmare which haunted\r\nhim of nights; he was trying desperately and belatedly to blow a brain\r\nas one blows soap-bubbles on such a mezoroic saurian as I had conjured\r\nup, while the clumsy monster's fate, all teeth and brains, crept nearer\r\nand nearer....\r\n\r\nI've grown, I think, since those days out of the urgency of that\r\napprehension. I still think a European war, and conceivably a very\r\nhumiliating war for England, may occur at no very distant date, but I\r\ndo not think there is any such heroic quality in our governing class\r\nas will make that war catastrophic. The prevailing spirit in English\r\nlife--it is one of the essential secrets of our imperial endurance--is\r\none of underbred aggression in prosperity and diplomatic compromise in\r\nmoments of danger; we bully haughtily where we can and assimilate where\r\nwe must. It is not for nothing that our upper and middle-class youth is\r\neducated by teachers of the highest character, scholars and gentlemen,\r\nmen who can pretend quite honestly that Darwinism hasn't upset the\r\nhistorical fall of man, that cricket is moral training, and that\r\nSocialism is an outrage upon the teachings of Christ. A sort of\r\ndignified dexterity of evasion is the national reward. Germany, with a\r\nlarger population, a vigorous and irreconcilable proletariat, a bolder\r\nintellectual training, a harsher spirit, can scarcely fail to drive us\r\nat last to a realisation of intolerable strain. So we may never fight at\r\nall. The war of preparations that has been going on for thirty years may\r\nend like a sham-fight at last in an umpire's decision. We shall proudly\r\nbut very firmly take the second place. For my own part, since I love\r\nEngland as much as I detest her present lethargy of soul, I pray for a\r\nchastening war--I wouldn't mind her flag in the dirt if only her spirit\r\nwould come out of it. So I was able to shake off that earlier fear of\r\nsome final and irrevocable destruction truncating all my schemes. At the\r\nmost, a European war would be a dramatic episode in the reconstruction I\r\nhad in view.\r\n\r\nIn India, too, I no longer foresee, as once I was inclined to\r\nsee, disaster. The English rule in India is surely one of the most\r\nextraordinary accidents that has ever happened in history. We are there\r\nlike a man who has fallen off a ladder on to the neck of an elephant,\r\nand doesn't know what to do or how to get down. Until something happens\r\nhe remains. Our functions in India are absurd. We English do not own\r\nthat country, do not even rule it. We make nothing happen; at the most\r\nwe prevent things happening. We suppress our own literature there. Most\r\nEnglish people cannot even go to this land they possess; the authorities\r\nwould prevent it. If Messrs. Perowne or Cook organised a cheap tour\r\nof Manchester operatives, it would be stopped. No one dare bring the\r\naverage English voter face to face with the reality of India, or let\r\nthe Indian native have a glimpse of the English voter. In my time I\r\nhave talked to English statesmen, Indian officials and ex-officials,\r\nviceroys, soldiers, every one who might be supposed to know what India\r\nsignifies, and I have prayed them to tell me what they thought we were\r\nup to there. I am not writing without my book in these matters. And\r\nbeyond a phrase or so about “even-handed justice”--and look at our\r\nsedition trials!--they told me nothing. Time after time I have heard\r\nof that apocryphal native ruler in the north-west, who, when asked what\r\nwould happen if we left India, replied that in a week his men would be\r\nin the saddle, and in six months not a rupee nor a virgin would be left\r\nin Lower Bengal. That is always given as our conclusive justification.\r\nBut is it our business to preserve the rupees and virgins of Lower\r\nBengal in a sort of magic inconclusiveness? Better plunder than\r\nparalysis, better fire and sword than futility. Our flag is spread over\r\nthe peninsula, without plans, without intentions--a vast preventive.\r\nThe sum total of our policy is to arrest any discussion, any conferences\r\nthat would enable the Indians to work out a tolerable scheme of the\r\nfuture for themselves. But that does not arrest the resentment of men\r\nheld back from life. Consider what it must be for the educated Indian\r\nsitting at the feast of contemporary possibilities with his mouth gagged\r\nand his hands bound behind him! The spirit of insurrection breaks out\r\nin spite of espionage and seizures. Our conflict for inaction develops\r\nstupendous absurdities. The other day the British Empire was taking off\r\nand examining printed cotton stomach wraps for seditious emblems and\r\ninscriptions....\r\n\r\nIn some manner we shall have to come out of India. We have had our\r\nchance, and we have demonstrated nothing but the appalling dulness of\r\nour national imagination. We are not good enough to do anything with\r\nIndia. Codger and Flack, and Gates and Dayton, Cladingbowl in the club,\r\nand the HOME CHURCHMAN in the home, cant about “character,” worship\r\nof strenuous force and contempt of truth; for the sake of such men and\r\nthings as these, we must abandon in fact, if not in appearance, that\r\nempty domination. Had we great schools and a powerful teaching, could we\r\nboast great men, had we the spirit of truth and creation in our lives,\r\nthen indeed it might be different. But a race that bears a sceptre must\r\ncarry gifts to justify it.\r\n\r\nIt does not follow that we shall be driven catastrophically from India.\r\nThat was my earlier mistake. We are not proud enough in our bones to be\r\nruined by India as Spain was by her empire. We may be able to abandon\r\nIndia with an air of still remaining there. It is our new method. We\r\ntrain our future rulers in the public schools to have a very wholesome\r\nrespect for strength, and as soon as a power arises in India in spite of\r\nus, be it a man or a culture, or a native state, we shall be willing to\r\ndeal with it. We may or may not have a war, but our governing class will\r\nbe quick to learn when we are beaten. Then they will repeat our South\r\nAfrican diplomacy, and arrange for some settlement that will abandon\r\nthe reality, such as it is, and preserve the semblance of power. The\r\nconqueror DE FACTO will become the new “loyal Briton,” and the democracy\r\nat home will be invited to celebrate our recession--triumphantly. I am\r\nno believer in the imminent dissolution of our Empire; I am less and\r\nless inclined to see in either India or Germany the probability of an\r\nabrupt truncation of those slow intellectual and moral constructions\r\nwhich are the essentials of statecraft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\r\nI sit writing in this little loggia to the sound of dripping water--this\r\nmorning we had rain, and the roof of our little casa is still not dry,\r\nthere are pools in the rocks under the sweet chestnuts, and the torrent\r\nthat crosses the salita is full and boastful,--and I try to recall the\r\norder of my impressions during that watching, dubious time, before I\r\nwent over to the Conservative Party. I was trying--chaotic task--to\r\ngauge the possibilities inherent in the quality of the British\r\naristocracy. There comes a broad spectacular effect of wide parks,\r\ndiversified by woods and bracken valleys, and dappled with deer; of\r\ngreat smooth lawns shaded by ancient trees; of big facades of sunlit\r\nbuildings dominating the country side; of large fine rooms full of\r\nhandsome, easy-mannered people. As a sort of representative picture to\r\nset off against those other pictures of Liberals and of Socialists I\r\nhave given, I recall one of those huge assemblies the Duchess of Clynes\r\ninaugurated at Stamford House. The place itself is one of the vastest\r\nprivate houses in London, a huge clustering mass of white and gold\r\nsaloons with polished floors and wonderful pictures, and staircases and\r\ngalleries on a Gargantuan scale. And there she sought to gather all\r\nthat was most representative of English activities, and did, in fact, in\r\nthose brilliant nocturnal crowds, get samples of nearly every section\r\nof our social and intellectual life, with a marked predominance upon the\r\npolitical and social side.\r\n\r\nI remember sitting in one of the recesses at the end of the big saloon\r\nwith Mrs. Redmondson, one of those sharp-minded, beautiful rich women\r\none meets so often in London, who seem to have done nothing and to be\r\ncapable of everything, and we watched the crowd--uniforms and splendours\r\nwere streaming in from a State ball--and exchanged information. I told\r\nher about the politicians and intellectuals, and she told me about the\r\naristocrats, and we sharpened our wit on them and counted the percentage\r\nof beautiful people among the latter, and wondered if the general effect\r\nof tallness was or was not an illusion.\r\n\r\nThey were, we agreed, for the most part bigger than the average of\r\npeople in London, and a handsome lot, even when they were not subtly\r\nindividualised. “They look so well nurtured,” I said, “well cared for.\r\nI like their quiet, well-trained movements, their pleasant consideration\r\nfor each other.”\r\n\r\n“Kindly, good tempered, and at bottom utterly selfish,” she said, “like\r\nbig, rather carefully trained, rather pampered children. What else can\r\nyou expect from them?”\r\n\r\n“They are good tempered, anyhow,” I witnessed, “and that's an\r\nachievement. I don't think I could ever be content under a bad-tempered,\r\nsentimentalism, strenuous Government. That's why I couldn't stand the\r\nRoosevelt REGIME in America. One's chief surprise when one comes across\r\nthese big people for the first time is their admirable easiness and\r\na real personal modesty. I confess I admire them. Oh! I like them.\r\nI wouldn't at all mind, I believe, giving over the country to this\r\naristocracy--given SOMETHING--”\r\n\r\n“Which they haven't got.”\r\n\r\n“Which they haven't got--or they'd be the finest sort of people in the\r\nworld.”\r\n\r\n“That something?” she inquired.\r\n\r\n“I don't know. I've been puzzling my wits to know. They've done all\r\nsorts of things--”\r\n\r\n“That's Lord Wrassleton,” she interrupted, “whose leg was broken--you\r\nremember?--at Spion Kop.”\r\n\r\n“It's healed very well. I like the gold lace and the white glove\r\nresting, with quite a nice awkwardness, on the sword. When I was a\r\nlittle boy I wanted to wear clothes like that. And the stars! He's got\r\nthe V. C. Most of these people here have at any rate shown pluck, you\r\nknow--brought something off.”\r\n\r\n“Not quite enough,” she suggested.\r\n\r\n“I think that's it,” I said. “Not quite enough--not quite hard enough,”\r\n I added.\r\n\r\nShe laughed and looked at me. “You'd like to make us,” she said.\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Hard.”\r\n\r\n“I don't think you'll go on if you don't get hard.”\r\n\r\n“We shan't be so pleasant if we do.”\r\n\r\n“Well, there my puzzled wits come in again. I don't see why an\r\naristocracy shouldn't be rather hard trained, and yet kindly. I'm not\r\nconvinced that the resources of education are exhausted. I want to\r\nbetter this, because it already looks so good.”\r\n\r\n“How are we to do it?” asked Mrs. Redmondson.\r\n\r\n“Oh, there you have me! I've been spending my time lately in trying to\r\nanswer that! It makes me quarrel with”--I held up my fingers and ticked\r\nthe items off--“the public schools, the private tutors, the army exams,\r\nthe Universities, the Church, the general attitude of the country\r\ntowards science and literature--”\r\n\r\n“We all do,” said Mrs. Redmondson. “We can't begin again at the\r\nbeginning,” she added.\r\n\r\n“Couldn't one,” I nodded at the assembly in general, start a movement?\r\n\r\n“There's the Confederates,” she said, with a faint smile that masked a\r\ngleam of curiosity.... “You want,” she said, “to say to the aristocracy,\r\n'Be aristocrats. NOBLESSE OBLIGE.' Do you remember what happened to the\r\nmonarch who was told to 'Be a King'?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” I said, “I want an aristocracy.”\r\n\r\n“This,” she said, smiling, “is the pick of them. The backwoodsmen are\r\noff the stage. These are the brilliant ones--the smart and the blues....\r\nThey cost a lot of money, you know.”\r\n\r\nSo far Mrs. Redmondson, but the picture remained full of things not\r\nstated in our speech. They were on the whole handsome people, charitable\r\nminded, happy, and easy. They led spacious lives, and there was\r\nsomething free and fearless about their bearing that I liked extremely.\r\nThe women particularly were wide-reading, fine-thinking. Mrs. Redmondson\r\ntalked as fully and widely and boldly as a man, and with those flashes\r\nof intuition, those startling, sudden delicacies of perception few men\r\ndisplay. I liked, too, the relations that held between women and men,\r\ntheir general tolerance, their antagonism to the harsh jealousies that\r\nare the essence of the middle-class order....\r\n\r\nAfter all, if one's aim resolved itself into the development of a type\r\nand culture of men, why shouldn't one begin at this end?\r\n\r\nIt is very easy indeed to generalise about a class of human beings, but\r\nmuch harder to produce a sample. Was old Lady Forthundred, for instance,\r\nfairly a sample? I remember her as a smiling, magnificent presence, a\r\ntowering accumulation of figure and wonderful shimmering blue silk and\r\nblack lace and black hair, and small fine features and chins and chins\r\nand chins, disposed in a big cane chair with wraps and cushions upon the\r\ngreat terrace of Champneys. Her eye was blue and hard, and her accent\r\nand intonation were exactly what you would expect from a rather\r\ncommonplace dressmaker pretending to be aristocratic. I was, I am\r\nafraid, posing a little as the intelligent but respectful inquirer from\r\nbelow investigating the great world, and she was certainly posing as my\r\ninformant. She affected a cynical coarseness. She developed a theory on\r\nthe governance of England, beautifully frank and simple. “Give 'um all\r\na peerage when they get twenty thousand a year,” she maintained. “That's\r\nmy remedy.”\r\n\r\nIn my new role of theoretical aristocrat I felt a little abashed.\r\n\r\n“Twenty thousand,” she repeated with conviction.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me that I was in the presence of the aristocratic\r\ntheory currently working as distinguished from my as yet unformulated\r\nintentions.\r\n\r\n“You'll get a lot of loafers and scamps among 'um,” said Lady\r\nForthundred. “You get loafers and scamps everywhere, but you'll get a\r\nlot of men who'll work hard to keep things together, and that's what\r\nwe're all after, isn't ut?\r\n\r\n“It's not an ideal arrangement.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me anything better,” said Lady Forthundred.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, and because she refused emphatically to believe in\r\neducation, Lady Forthundred scored.\r\n\r\nWe had been discussing Cossington's recent peerage, for Cossington, my\r\nold schoolfellow at City Merchants', and my victor in the affair of\r\nthe magazine, had clambered to an amazing wealth up a piled heap of\r\nenergetically pushed penny and halfpenny magazines, and a group of\r\ndaily newspapers. I had expected to find the great lady hostile to the\r\nnew-comer, but she accepted him, she gloried in him.\r\n\r\n“We're a peerage,” she said, “but none of us have ever had any nonsense\r\nabout nobility.”\r\n\r\nShe turned and smiled down on me. “We English,” she said, “are a\r\npractical people. We assimilate 'um.”\r\n\r\n“Then, I suppose, they don't give trouble?”\r\n\r\n“Then they don't give trouble.”\r\n\r\n“They learn to shoot?”\r\n\r\n“And all that,” said Lady Forthundred. “Yes. And things go on. Sometimes\r\nbetter than others, but they go on--somehow. It depends very much on the\r\nsort of butler who pokes 'um about.”\r\n\r\nI suggested that it might be possible to get a secure twenty thousand a\r\nyear by at least detrimental methods--socially speaking.\r\n\r\n“We must take the bad and the good of 'um,” said Lady Forthundred,\r\ncourageously....\r\n\r\nNow, was she a sample? It happened she talked. What was there in the\r\nbrains of the multitude of her first, second, third, fourth, and fifth\r\ncousins, who didn't talk, who shone tall, and bearing themselves finely,\r\nagainst a background of deft, attentive maids and valets, on every\r\nspacious social scene? How did things look to them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\nSide by side with Lady Forthundred, it is curious to put Evesham with\r\nhis tall, bent body, his little-featured almost elvish face, his unequal\r\nmild brown eyes, his gentle manner, his sweet, amazing oratory. He led\r\nall these people wonderfully. He was always curious and interested about\r\nlife, wary beneath a pleasing frankness--and I tormented my brain to get\r\nto the bottom of him. For a long time he was the most powerful man in\r\nEngland under the throne; he had the Lords in his hand, and a great\r\nmajority in the Commons, and the discontents and intrigues that are the\r\nconcomitants of an overwhelming party advantage broke against him as\r\nwaves break against a cliff. He foresaw so far in these matters that it\r\nseemed he scarcely troubled to foresee. He brought political art to\r\nthe last triumph of naturalness. Always for me he has been the typical\r\naristocrat, so typical and above the mere forms of aristocracy, that he\r\nremained a commoner to the end of his days.\r\n\r\nI had met him at the beginning of my career; he read some early papers\r\nof mine, and asked to see me, and I conceived a flattered liking for him\r\nthat strengthened to a very strong feeling indeed. He seemed to me to\r\nstand alone without an equal, the greatest man in British political\r\nlife. Some men one sees through and understands, some one cannot see\r\ninto or round because they are of opaque clay, but about Evesham I had a\r\nsense of things hidden as it were by depth and mists, because he was so\r\nbig and atmospheric a personality. No other contemporary has had that\r\neffect upon me. I've sat beside him at dinners, stayed in houses with\r\nhim--he was in the big house party at Champneys--talked to him,\r\nsounded him, watching him as I sat beside him. I could talk to him with\r\nextraordinary freedom and a rare sense of being understood. Other men\r\nhave to be treated in a special manner; approached through their own\r\nmental dialect, flattered by a minute regard for what they have said and\r\ndone. Evesham was as widely and charitably receptive as any man I have\r\never met. The common politicians beside him seemed like rows of stuffy\r\nlittle rooms looking out upon the sea.\r\n\r\nAnd what was he up to? What did HE think we were doing with Mankind?\r\nThat I thought worth knowing.\r\n\r\nI remember his talking on one occasion at the Hartsteins', at a dinner\r\nso tremendously floriferous and equipped that we were almost forced into\r\nduologues, about the possible common constructive purpose in politics.\r\n\r\n“I feel so much,” he said, “that the best people in every party\r\nconverge. We don't differ at Westminster as they do in the country\r\ntowns. There's a sort of extending common policy that goes on under\r\nevery government, because on the whole it's the right thing to do, and\r\npeople know it. Things that used to be matters of opinion become matters\r\nof science--and cease to be party questions.”\r\n\r\nHe instanced education.\r\n\r\n“Apart,” said I, “from the religious question.”\r\n\r\n“Apart from the religious question.”\r\n\r\nHe dropped that aspect with an easy grace, and went on with his general\r\ntheme that political conflict was the outcome of uncertainty. “Directly\r\nyou get a thing established, so that people can say, 'Now this is\r\nRight,' with the same conviction that people can say water is a\r\ncombination of oxygen and hydrogen, there's no more to be said. The\r\nthing has to be done....”\r\n\r\nAnd to put against this effect of Evesham, broad and humanely tolerant,\r\nposing as the minister of a steadily developing constructive conviction,\r\nthere are other memories.\r\n\r\nHave I not seen him in the House, persistent, persuasive, indefatigable,\r\nand by all my standards wickedly perverse, leaning over the table with\r\nthose insistent movements of his hand upon it, or swaying forward with\r\na grip upon his coat lapel, fighting with a diabolical skill to preserve\r\nwhat are in effect religious tests, tests he must have known would\r\noutrage and humiliate and injure the consciences of a quarter--and that\r\nperhaps the best quarter--of the youngsters who come to the work of\r\nelementary education?\r\n\r\nIn playing for points in the game of party advantage Evesham displayed\r\nat times a quite wicked unscrupulousness in the use of his subtle mind.\r\nI would sit on the Liberal benches and watch him, and listen to his\r\nurbane voice, fascinated by him. Did he really care? Did anything matter\r\nto him? And if it really mattered nothing, why did he trouble to serve\r\nthe narrowness and passion of his side? Or did he see far beyond my\r\nscope, so that this petty iniquity was justified by greater, remoter\r\nends of which I had no intimation?\r\n\r\nThey accused him of nepotism. His friends and family were certainly well\r\ncared for. In private life he was full of an affectionate intimacy; he\r\npleased by being charmed and pleased. One might think at times there was\r\nno more of him than a clever man happily circumstanced, and finding an\r\ninterest and occupation in politics. And then came a glimpse of thought,\r\nof imagination, like the sight of a soaring eagle through a staircase\r\nskylight. Oh, beyond question he was great! No other contemporary\r\npolitician had his quality. In no man have I perceived so\r\nsympathetically the great contrast between warm, personal things and the\r\nwhite dream of statecraft. Except that he had it seemed no hot passions,\r\nbut only interests and fine affections and indolences, he paralleled the\r\nconflict of my life. He saw and thought widely and deeply; but at times\r\nit seemed to me his greatness stood over and behind the reality of his\r\nlife, like some splendid servant, thinking his own thoughts, who waits\r\nbehind a lesser master's chair....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, when Evesham talked of this ideal of the organised state\r\nbecoming so finely true to practicability and so clearly stated as to\r\nhave the compelling conviction of physical science, he spoke quite after\r\nmy heart. Had he really embodied the attempt to realise that, I could\r\nhave done no more than follow him blindly. But neither he nor I embodied\r\nthat, and there lies the gist of my story. And when it came to a study\r\nof others among the leading Tories and Imperialists the doubt increased,\r\nuntil with some at last it was possible to question whether they had any\r\nimaginative conception of constructive statecraft at all; whether they\r\ndidn't opaquely accept the world for what it was, and set themselves\r\nsingle-mindedly to make a place for themselves and cut a figure in it.\r\n\r\nThere were some very fine personalities among them: there were the great\r\npeers who had administered Egypt, India, South Africa, Framboya--Cromer,\r\nKitchener, Curzon, Milner, Gane, for example. So far as that easier\r\ntask of holding sword and scales had gone, they had shown the finest\r\nqualities, but they had returned to the perplexing and exacting problem\r\nof the home country, a little glorious, a little too simply bold. They\r\nwanted to arm and they wanted to educate, but the habit of immediate\r\nnecessity made them far more eager to arm than to educate, and their\r\nexperience of heterogeneous controls made them overrate the need for\r\nobedience in a homogeneous country. They didn't understand raw men,\r\nill-trained men, uncertain minds, and intelligent women; and these are\r\nthe things that matter in England.... There were also the great business\r\nadventurers, from Cranber to Cossington (who was now Lord Paddockhurst).\r\nMy mind remained unsettled, and went up and down the scale between\r\na belief in their far-sighted purpose and the perception of crude\r\nvanities, coarse ambitions, vulgar competitiveness, and a mere habitual\r\npersistence in the pursuit of gain. For a time I saw a good deal of\r\nCossington--I wish I had kept a diary of his talk and gestures, to mark\r\nhow he could vary from day to day between a POSEUR, a smart tradesman,\r\nand a very bold and wide-thinking political schemer. He had a vanity\r\nof sweeping actions, motor car pounces, Napoleonic rushes, that led to\r\nviolent ineffectual changes in the policy of his papers, and a haunting\r\npursuit by parallel columns in the liberal press that never abashed him\r\nin the slightest degree. By an accident I plumbed the folly in him--but\r\nI feel I never plumbed his wisdom. I remember him one day after a lunch\r\nat the Barhams' saying suddenly, out of profound meditation over the end\r\nof a cigar, one of those sentences that seem to light the whole interior\r\nbeing of a man. “Some day,” he said softly, rather to himself than to\r\nme, and A PROPOS of nothing--“some day I will raise the country.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” I said, after a pause, and leant across him for the little\r\nsilver spirit-lamp, to light my cigarette....\r\n\r\nThen the Tories had for another section the ancient creations, and again\r\nthere were the financial peers, men accustomed to reserve, and their big\r\nlawyers, accustomed to--well, qualified statement. And below the giant\r\npersonalities of the party were the young bloods, young, adventurous men\r\nof the type of Lord Tarvrille, who had seen service in South Africa,\r\nwho had travelled and hunted; explorers, keen motorists, interested\r\nin aviation, active in army organisation. Good, brown-faced stuff they\r\nwere, but impervious to ideas outside the range of their activities,\r\nmore ignorant of science than their chauffeurs, and of the quality\r\nof English people than welt-politicians; contemptuous of school and\r\nuniversity by reason of the Gateses and Flacks and Codgers who had come\r\ntheir way, witty, light-hearted, patriotic at the Kipling level, with\r\na certain aptitude for bullying. They varied in insensible gradations\r\nbetween the noble sportsmen on the one hand, and men like Gane and the\r\nTories of our Pentagram club on the other. You perceive how a man\r\nmight exercise his mind in the attempt to strike an average of public\r\nserviceability in this miscellany! And mixed up with these, mixed up\r\nsometimes in the same man, was the pure reactionary, whose predominant\r\nidea was that the village schools should confine themselves to teaching\r\nthe catechism, hat-touching and courtesying, and be given a holiday\r\nwhenever beaters were in request....\r\n\r\nI find now in my mind as a sort of counterpoise to Evesham the figure\r\nof old Lord Wardingham, asleep in the largest armchair in the library\r\nof Stamford Court after lunch. One foot rested on one of those things--I\r\nthink they are called gout stools. He had been playing golf all the\r\nmorning and wearied a weak instep; at lunch he had sat at my table and\r\ntalked in the overbearing manner permitted to irascible important men\r\nwhose insteps are painful. Among other things he had flouted the idea\r\nthat women would ever understand statecraft or be more than a nuisance\r\nin politics, denied flatly that Hindoos were capable of anything\r\nwhatever except excesses in population, regretted he could not\r\ncensor picture galleries and circulating libraries, and declared that\r\ndissenters were people who pretended to take theology seriously with the\r\nexpress purpose of upsetting the entirely satisfactory compromise of the\r\nEstablished Church. “No sensible people, with anything to gain or lose,\r\nargue about religion,” he said. “They mean mischief.” Having delivered\r\nhis soul upon these points, and silenced the little conversation to the\r\nleft of him from which they had arisen, he became, after an appreciative\r\nencounter with a sanguinary woodcock, more amiable, responded to some\r\nrespectful initiatives of Crupp's, and related a number of classical\r\nanecdotes of those blighting snubs, vindictive retorts and scandalous\r\nmiscarriages of justice that are so dear to the forensic mind. Now he\r\nreposed. He was breathing heavily with his mouth a little open and his\r\nhead on one side. One whisker was turned back against the comfortable\r\npadding. His plump strong hands gripped the arms of his chair, and his\r\nfrown was a little assuaged. How tremendously fed up he looked! Honours,\r\nwealth, influence, respect, he had them all. How scornful and hard it\r\nhad made his unguarded expression!\r\n\r\nI note without comment that it didn't even occur to me then to wake him\r\nup and ask him what HE was up to with mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\n\r\nOne countervailing influence to my drift to Toryism in those days was\r\nMargaret's quite religious faith in the Liberals. I realised that slowly\r\nand with a mild astonishment. It set me, indeed, even then questioning\r\nmy own change of opinion. We came at last incidentally, as our way was,\r\nto an exchange of views. It was as nearly a quarrel as we had before\r\nI came over to the Conservative side. It was at Champneys, and I think\r\nduring the same visit that witnessed my exploration of Lady Forthundred.\r\nIt arose indirectly, I think, out of some comments of mine upon our\r\nfellow-guests, but it is one of those memories of which the scene and\r\nquality remain more vivid than the things said, a memory without any\r\nvery definite beginning or end. It was afternoon, in the pause between\r\ntea and the dressing bell, and we were in Margaret's big silver-adorned,\r\nchintz-bright room, looking out on the trim Italian garden.... Yes, the\r\nbeginning of it has escaped me altogether, but I remember it as an odd\r\nexceptional little wrangle.\r\n\r\nAt first we seem to have split upon the moral quality of the\r\naristocracy, and I had an odd sense that in some way too feminine for\r\nme to understand our hostess had aggrieved her. She said, I know, that\r\nChampneys distressed her; made her “eager for work and reality again.”\r\n\r\n“But aren't these people real?”\r\n\r\n“They're so superficial, so extravagant!”\r\n\r\nI said I was not shocked by their unreality. They seemed the least\r\naffected people I had ever met. “And are they really so extravagant?”\r\n I asked, and put it to her that her dresses cost quite as much as any\r\nother woman's in the house.\r\n\r\n“It's not only their dresses,” Margaret parried. “It's the scale and\r\nspirit of things.”\r\n\r\nI questioned that. “They're cynical,” said Margaret, staring before her\r\nout of the window.\r\n\r\nI challenged her, and she quoted the Brabants, about whom there had\r\nbeen an ancient scandal. She'd heard of it from Altiora, and it was also\r\nAltiora who'd given her a horror of Lord Carnaby, who was also with us.\r\n“You know his reputation,” said Margaret. “That Normandy girl. Every\r\none knows about it. I shiver when I look at him. He seems--oh! like\r\nsomething not of OUR civilisation. He WILL come and say little things to\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“Offensive things?”\r\n\r\n“No, politenesses and things. Of course his manners are--quite right.\r\nThat only makes it worse, I think. It shows he might have helped--all\r\nthat happened. I do all I can to make him see I don't like him. But none\r\nof the others make the slightest objection to him.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps these people imagine something might be said for him.”\r\n\r\n“That's just it,” said Margaret.\r\n\r\n“Charity,” I suggested.\r\n\r\n“I don't like that sort of toleration.”\r\n\r\nI was oddly annoyed. “Like eating with publicans and sinners,” I said.\r\n“No!...”\r\n\r\nBut scandals, and the contempt for rigid standards their condonation\r\ndisplayed, weren't more than the sharp edge of the trouble. “It's their\r\nwhole position, their selfish predominance, their class conspiracy\r\nagainst the mass of people,” said Margaret. “When I sit at dinner\r\nin that splendid room, with its glitter and white reflections and\r\ncandlelight, and its flowers and its wonderful service and its\r\ncandelabra of solid gold, I seem to feel the slums and the mines and the\r\nover-crowded cottages stuffed away under the table.”\r\n\r\nI reminded Margaret that she was not altogether innocent of unearned\r\nincrement.\r\n\r\n“But aren't we doing our best to give it back?” she said.\r\n\r\nI was moved to question her. “Do you really think,” I asked, “that the\r\nTories and peers and rich people are to blame for social injustice as we\r\nhave it to-day? Do you really see politics as a struggle of light on the\r\nLiberal side against darkness on the Tory?”\r\n\r\n“They MUST know,” said Margaret.\r\n\r\nI found myself questioning that. I see now that to Margaret it must have\r\nseemed the perversest carping against manifest things, but at the time\r\nI was concentrated simply upon the elucidation of her view and my own; I\r\nwanted to get at her conception in the sharpest, hardest lines that were\r\npossible. It was perfectly clear that she saw Toryism as the diabolical\r\nelement in affairs. The thing showed in its hopeless untruth all the\r\nclearer for the fine, clean emotion with which she gave it out to me.\r\nMy sleeping peer in the library at Stamford Court and Evesham talking\r\nluminously behind the Hartstein flowers embodied the devil, and my\r\nreplete citizen sucking at his cigar in the National Liberal Club,\r\nWillie Crampton discussing the care and management of the stomach over\r\na specially hygienic lemonade, and Dr. Tumpany in his aggressive\r\nfrock-coat pegging out a sort of copyright in Socialism, were the centre\r\nand wings of the angelic side. It was nonsense. But how was I to put the\r\ntruth to her?\r\n\r\n“I don't see things at all as you do,” I said. “I don't see things in\r\nthe same way.”\r\n\r\n“Think of the poor,” said Margaret, going off at a tangent.\r\n\r\n“Think of every one,” I said. “We Liberals have done more mischief\r\nthrough well-intentioned benevolence than all the selfishness in the\r\nworld could have done. We built up the liquor interest.”\r\n\r\n“WE!” cried Margaret. “How can you say that? It's against us.”\r\n\r\n“Naturally. But we made it a monopoly in our clumsy efforts to prevent\r\npeople drinking what they liked, because it interfered with industrial\r\nregularity--”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” cried Margaret, stung; and I could see she thought I was talking\r\nmere wickedness.\r\n\r\n“That's it,” I said.\r\n\r\n“But would you have people drink whatever they pleased?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. What right have I to dictate to other men and women?”\r\n\r\n“But think of the children!”\r\n\r\n“Ah! there you have the folly of modern Liberalism, its half-cunning,\r\nhalf-silly way of getting at everything in a roundabout fashion. If\r\nneglecting children is an offence, and it IS an offence, then deal\r\nwith it as such, but don't go badgering and restricting people who sell\r\nsomething that may possibly in some cases lead to a neglect of children.\r\nIf drunkenness is an offence, punish it, but don't punish a man for\r\nselling honest drink that perhaps after all won't make any one drunk at\r\nall. Don't intensify the viciousness of the public-house by assuming the\r\nplace isn't fit for women and children. That's either spite or folly.\r\nMake the public-house FIT for women and children. Make it a real\r\npublic-house. If we Liberals go on as we are going, we shall presently\r\nwant to stop the sale of ink and paper because those things tempt men\r\nto forgery. We do already threaten the privacy of the post because of\r\nbetting tout's letters. The drift of all that kind of thing is narrow,\r\nunimaginative, mischievous, stupid....”\r\n\r\nI stopped short and walked to the window and surveyed a pretty fountain,\r\nfacsimile of one in Verona, amidst trim-cut borderings of yew. Beyond,\r\nand seen between the stems of ilex trees, was a great blaze of yellow\r\nflowers....\r\n\r\n“But prevention,” I heard Margaret behind me, “is the essence of our\r\nwork.”\r\n\r\nI turned. “There's no prevention but education. There's no antiseptics\r\nin life but love and fine thinking. Make people fine, make fine people.\r\nDon't be afraid. These Tory leaders are better people individually\r\nthan the average; why cast them for the villains of the piece? The\r\nreal villain in the piece--in the whole human drama--is the\r\nmuddle-headedness, and it matters very little if it's virtuous-minded or\r\nwicked. I want to get at muddle-headedness. If I could do that I could\r\nlet all that you call wickedness in the world run about and do what\r\nit jolly well pleased. It would matter about as much as a slightly\r\nneglected dog--in an otherwise well-managed home.”\r\n\r\nMy thoughts had run away with me.\r\n\r\n“I can't understand you,” said Margaret, in the profoundest distress. “I\r\ncan't understand how it is you are coming to see things like this.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moods of a thinking man in politics are curiously evasive and\r\ndifficult to describe. Neither the public nor the historian will permit\r\nthe statesman moods. He has from the first to assume he has an Aim, a\r\ndefinite Aim, and to pretend to an absolute consistency with that. Those\r\nsubtle questionings about the very fundamentals of life which plague us\r\nall so relentlessly nowadays are supposed to be silenced. He lifts his\r\nchin and pursues his Aim explicitly in the sight of all men. Those\r\nwho have no real political experience can scarcely imagine the immense\r\nmental and moral strain there is between one's everyday acts and\r\nutterances on the one hand and the “thinking-out” process on the other.\r\nIt is perplexingly difficult to keep in your mind, fixed and firm, a\r\nscheme essentially complex, to keep balancing a swaying possibility\r\nwhile at the same time under jealous, hostile, and stupid observation\r\nyou tread your part in the platitudinous, quarrelsome, ill-presented\r\nmarch of affairs....\r\n\r\nThe most impossible of all autobiographies is an intellectual\r\nautobiography. I have thrown together in the crudest way the elements\r\nof the problem I struggled with, but I can give no record of the subtle\r\ndetails; I can tell nothing of the long vacillations between Protean\r\nvalues, the talks and re-talks, the meditations, the bleak lucidities of\r\nsleepless nights....\r\n\r\nAnd yet these things I have struggled with must be thought out, and, to\r\nbegin with, they must be thought out in this muddled, experimenting way.\r\nTo go into a study to think about statecraft is to turn your back on the\r\nrealities you are constantly needing to feel and test and sound if your\r\nthinking is to remain vital; to choose an aim and pursue it in despite\r\nof all subsequent questionings is to bury the talent of your mind. It\r\nis no use dealing with the intricate as though it were simple, to leap\r\nhaphazard at the first course of action that presents itself; the whole\r\nworld of politicians is far too like a man who snatches a poker to a\r\nfailing watch. It is easy to say he wants to “get something done,” but\r\nthe only sane thing to do for the moment is to put aside that poker and\r\ntake thought and get a better implement....\r\n\r\nOne of the results of these fundamental preoccupations of mine was a\r\ncurious irritability towards Margaret that I found difficult to conceal.\r\nIt was one of the incidental cruelties of our position that this should\r\nhappen. I was in such doubt myself, that I had no power to phrase\r\nthings for her in a form she could use. Hitherto I had stage-managed our\r\n“serious” conversations. Now I was too much in earnest and too uncertain\r\nto go on doing this. I avoided talk with her. Her serene, sustained\r\nconfidence in vague formulae and sentimental aspirations exasperated me;\r\nher want of sympathetic apprehension made my few efforts to indicate my\r\nchanging attitudes distressing and futile. It wasn't that I was always\r\nthinking right, and that she was always saying wrong. It was that I was\r\nstruggling to get hold of a difficult thing that was, at any rate, half\r\ntrue, I could not gauge how true, and that Margaret's habitual phrasing\r\nignored these elusive elements of truth, and without premeditation\r\nfitted into the weaknesses of my new intimations, as though they had\r\nnothing but weaknesses. It was, for example, obvious that these big\r\npeople, who were the backbone of Imperialism and Conservatism, were\r\ntemperamentally lax, much more indolent, much more sensuous, than our\r\ndeliberately virtuous Young Liberals. I didn't want to be reminded of\r\nthat, just when I was in full effort to realise the finer elements in\r\ntheir composition. Margaret classed them and disposed of them. It was\r\nour incurable differences in habits and gestures of thought coming\r\nbetween us again.\r\n\r\nThe desert of misunderstanding widened. I was forced back upon myself\r\nand my own secret councils. For a time I went my way alone; an unmixed\r\nevil for both of us. Except for that Pentagram evening, a series of\r\ntalks with Isabel Rivers, who was now becoming more and more important\r\nin my intellectual life, and the arguments I maintained with Crupp, I\r\nnever really opened my mind at all during that period of indecisions,\r\nslow abandonments, and slow acquisitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE THIRD ~~ SECESSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last, out of a vast accumulation of impressions, decision distilled\r\nquite suddenly. I succumbed to Evesham and that dream of the right\r\nthing triumphant through expression. I determined I would go over to\r\nthe Conservatives, and use my every gift and power on the side of such\r\nforces on that side as made for educational reorganisation, scientific\r\nresearch, literature, criticism, and intellectual development. That was\r\nin 1909. I judged the Tories were driving straight at a conflict with\r\nthe country, and I thought them bound to incur an electoral defeat. I\r\nunder-estimated their strength in the counties. There would follow, I\r\ncalculated, a period of profound reconstruction in method and policy\r\nalike. I was entirely at one with Crupp in perceiving in this an immense\r\nopportunity for the things we desired. An aristocracy quickened by\r\nconflict and on the defensive, and full of the idea of justification\r\nby reconstruction, might prove altogether more apt for thought and\r\nhigh professions than Mrs. Redmondson's spoilt children. Behind the now\r\ninevitable struggle for a reform of the House of Lords, there would\r\nbe great heart searchings and educational endeavour. On that we\r\nreckoned....\r\n\r\nAt last we talked it out to the practical pitch, and Crupp and\r\nShoesmith, and I and Gane, made our definite agreement together....\r\n\r\nI emerged from enormous silences upon Margaret one evening.\r\n\r\nShe was just back from the display of some new musicians at the\r\nHartsteins. I remember she wore a dress of golden satin, very\r\nrich-looking and splendid. About her slender neck there was a rope of\r\ngold-set amber beads. Her hair caught up and echoed and returned these\r\ngolden notes. I, too, was in evening dress, but where I had been escapes\r\nme,--some forgotten dinner, I suppose. I went into her room. I remember\r\nI didn't speak for some moments. I went across to the window and pulled\r\nthe blind aside, and looked out upon the railed garden of the square,\r\nwith its shrubs and shadowed turf gleaming pallidly and irregularly in\r\nthe light of the big electric standard in the corner.\r\n\r\n“Margaret,” I said, “I think I shall break with the party.”\r\n\r\nShe made no answer. I turned presently, a movement of enquiry.\r\n\r\n“I was afraid you meant to do that,” she said.\r\n\r\n“I'm out of touch,” I explained. “Altogether.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I know.”\r\n\r\n“It places me in a difficult position,” I said.\r\n\r\nMargaret stood at her dressing-table, looking steadfastly at herself\r\nin the glass, and with her fingers playing with a litter of stoppered\r\nbottles of tinted glass. “I was afraid it was coming to this,” she said.\r\n\r\n“In a way,” I said, “we've been allies. I owe my seat to you. I couldn't\r\nhave gone into Parliament....”\r\n\r\n“I don't want considerations like that to affect us,” she interrupted.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. She sat down in a chair by her dressing-table, lifted\r\nan ivory hand-glass, and put it down again.\r\n\r\n“I wish,” she said, with something like a sob in her voice, “it were\r\npossible that you shouldn't do this.” She stopped abruptly, and I did\r\nnot look at her, because I could feel the effort she was making to\r\ncontrol herself.\r\n\r\n“I thought,” she began again, “when you came into Parliament--”\r\n\r\nThere came another silence. “It's all gone so differently,” she said.\r\n“Everything has gone so differently.”\r\n\r\nI had a sudden memory of her, shining triumphant after the Kinghampstead\r\nelection, and for the first time I realised just how perplexing and\r\ndisappointing my subsequent career must have been to her.\r\n\r\n“I'm not doing this without consideration,” I said.\r\n\r\n“I know,” she said, in a voice of despair, “I've seen it coming. But--I\r\nstill don't understand it. I don't understand how you can go over.”\r\n\r\n“My ideas have changed and developed,” I said.\r\n\r\nI walked across to her bearskin hearthrug, and stood by the mantel.\r\n\r\n“To think that you,” she said; “you who might have been leader--” She\r\ncould not finish it. “All the forces of reaction,” she threw out.\r\n\r\n“I don't think they are the forces of reaction,” I said. “I think I can\r\nfind work to do--better work on that side.”\r\n\r\n“Against us!” she said. “As if progress wasn't hard enough! As if it\r\ndidn't call upon every able man!”\r\n\r\n“I don't think Liberalism has a monopoly of progress.”\r\n\r\nShe did not answer that. She sat quite still looking in front of her.\r\n“WHY have you gone over?” she asked abruptly as though I had said\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nThere came a silence that I was impelled to end. I began a stiff\r\ndissertation from the hearthrug. “I am going over, because I think I\r\nmay join in an intellectual renascence on the Conservative side. I\r\nthink that in the coming struggle there will be a partial and altogether\r\nconfused and demoralising victory for democracy, that will stir the\r\nclasses which now dominate the Conservative party into an energetic\r\nrevival. They will set out to win back, and win back. Even if my\r\nestimate of contemporary forces is wrong and they win, they will still\r\nbe forced to reconstruct their outlook. A war abroad will supply the\r\nchastening if home politics fail. The effort at renascence is bound to\r\ncome by either alternative. I believe I can do more in relation to\r\nthat effort than in any other connexion in the world of politics at the\r\npresent time. That's my case, Margaret.”\r\n\r\nShe certainly did not grasp what I said. “And so you will throw aside\r\nall the beginnings, all the beliefs and pledges--” Again her sentence\r\nremained incomplete. “I doubt if even, once you have gone over, they\r\nwill welcome you.”\r\n\r\n“That hardly matters.”\r\n\r\nI made an effort to resume my speech.\r\n\r\n“I came into Parliament, Margaret,” I said, “a little prematurely.\r\nStill--I suppose it was only by coming into Parliament that I could see\r\nthings as I do now in terms of personality and imaginative range....”\r\n I stopped. Her stiff, unhappy, unlistening silence broke up my\r\ndisquisition.\r\n\r\n“After all,” I remarked, “most of this has been implicit in my\r\nwritings.”\r\n\r\nShe made no sign of admission.\r\n\r\n“What are you going to do?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Keep my seat for a time and make the reasons of my breach clear. Then\r\neither I must resign or--probably this new Budget will lead to a\r\nGeneral Election. It's evidently meant to strain the Lords and provoke a\r\nquarrel.”\r\n\r\n“You might, I think, have stayed to fight for the Budget.”\r\n\r\n“I'm not,” I said, “so keen against the Lords.”\r\n\r\nOn that we halted.\r\n\r\n“But what are you going to do?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“I shall make my quarrel over some points in the Budget. I can't quite\r\ntell you yet where my chance will come. Then I shall either resign my\r\nseat--or if things drift to dissolution I shall stand again.”\r\n\r\n“It's political suicide.”\r\n\r\n“Not altogether.”\r\n\r\n“I can't imagine you out of Parliament again. It's just like--like\r\nundoing all we have done. What will you do?”\r\n\r\n“Write. Make a new, more definite place for myself. You know, of course,\r\nthere's already a sort of group about Crupp and Gane.”\r\n\r\nMargaret seemed lost for a time in painful thought.\r\n\r\n“For me,” she said at last, “our political work has been a religion--it\r\nhas been more than a religion.”\r\n\r\nI heard in silence. I had no form of protest available against the\r\nimplications of that.\r\n\r\n“And then I find you turning against all we aimed to do--talking of\r\ngoing over, almost lightly--to those others.”...\r\n\r\nShe was white-lipped as she spoke. In the most curious way she had\r\ncaptured the moral values of the situation. I found myself protesting\r\nineffectually against her fixed conviction. “It's because I think my\r\nduty lies in this change that I make it,” I said.\r\n\r\n“I don't see how you can say that,” she replied quietly.\r\n\r\nThere was another pause between us.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” she said and clenched her hand upon the table. “That it should\r\nhave come to this!”\r\n\r\nShe was extraordinarily dignified and extraordinarily absurd. She was\r\nhurt and thwarted beyond measure. She had no place in her ideas, I\r\nthought, for me. I could see how it appeared to her, but I could not\r\nmake her see anything of the intricate process that had brought me to\r\nthis divergence. The opposition of our intellectual temperaments\r\nwas like a gag in my mouth. What was there for me to say? A flash\r\nof intuition told me that behind her white dignity was a passionate\r\ndisappointment, a shattering of dreams that needed before everything\r\nelse the relief of weeping.\r\n\r\n“I've told you,” I said awkwardly, “as soon as I could.”\r\n\r\nThere was another long silence. “So that is how we stand,” I said with\r\nan air of having things defined. I walked slowly to the door.\r\n\r\nShe had risen and stood now staring in front of her.\r\n\r\n“Good-night,” I said, making no movement towards our habitual kiss.\r\n\r\n“Good-night,” she answered in a tragic note....\r\n\r\nI closed the door softly. I remained for a moment or so on the big\r\nlanding, hesitating between my bedroom and my study. As I did so I heard\r\nthe soft rustle of her movement and the click of the key in her bedroom\r\ndoor. Then everything was still....\r\n\r\nShe hid her tears from me. Something gripped my heart at the thought.\r\n\r\n“Damnation!” I said wincing. “Why the devil can't people at least THINK\r\nin the same manner?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd that insufficient colloquy was the beginning of a prolonged\r\nestrangement between us. It was characteristic of our relations that we\r\nnever reopened the discussion. The thing had been in the air for some\r\ntime; we had recognised it now; the widening breach between us was\r\nconfessed. My own feelings were curiously divided. It is remarkable that\r\nmy very real affection for Margaret only became evident to me with this\r\nquarrel. The changes of the heart are very subtle changes. I am quite\r\nunaware how or when my early romantic love for her purity and beauty\r\nand high-principled devotion evaporated from my life; but I do know that\r\nquite early in my parliamentary days there had come a vague, unconfessed\r\nresentment at the tie that seemed to hold me in servitude to her\r\nstandards of private living and public act. I felt I was caught, and\r\nnone the less so because it had been my own act to rivet on my shackles.\r\nSo long as I still held myself bound to her that resentment grew. Now,\r\nsince I had broken my bonds and taken my line it withered again, and I\r\ncould think of Margaret with a returning kindliness.\r\n\r\nBut I still felt embarrassment with her. I felt myself dependent upon\r\nher for house room and food and social support, as it were under false\r\npretences. I would have liked to have separated our financial affairs\r\naltogether. But I knew that to raise the issue would have seemed a\r\nlast brutal indelicacy. So I tried almost furtively to keep my personal\r\nexpenditure within the scope of the private income I made by writing,\r\nand we went out together in her motor brougham, dined and made\r\nappearances, met politely at breakfast--parted at night with a kiss upon\r\nher cheek. The locking of her door upon me, which at that time I quite\r\nunderstood, which I understand now, became for a time in my mind,\r\nthrough some obscure process of the soul, an offence. I never crossed\r\nthe landing to her room again.\r\n\r\nIn all this matter, and, indeed, in all my relations with Margaret, I\r\nperceive now I behaved badly and foolishly. My manifest blunder is that\r\nI, who was several years older than she, much subtler and in many ways\r\nwiser, never in any measure sought to guide and control her. After our\r\nmarriage I treated her always as an equal, and let her go her way; held\r\nher responsible for all the weak and ineffective and unfortunate things\r\nshe said and did to me. She wasn't clever enough to justify that. It\r\nwasn't fair to expect her to sympathise, anticipate, and understand.\r\nI ought to have taken care of her, roped her to me when it came to\r\ncrossing the difficult places. If I had loved her more, and wiselier and\r\nmore tenderly, if there had not been the consciousness of my financial\r\ndependence on her always stiffening my pride, I think she would have\r\nmoved with me from the outset, and left the Liberals with me. But she\r\ndid not get any inkling of the ends I sought in my change of sides. It\r\nmust have seemed to her inexplicable perversity. She had, I knew--for\r\nsurely I knew it then--an immense capacity for loyalty and devotion.\r\nThere she was with these treasures untouched, neglected and perplexed.\r\nA woman who loves wants to give. It is the duty and business of the man\r\nshe has married for love to help her to help and give. But I was stupid.\r\nMy eyes had never been opened. I was stiff with her and difficult to\r\nher, because even on my wedding morning there had been, deep down in\r\nmy soul, voiceless though present, something weakly protesting, a faint\r\nperception of wrong-doing, the infinitesimally small, slow-multiplying\r\ngerms of shame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nI made my breach with the party on the Budget.\r\n\r\nIn many ways I was disposed to regard the 1909 Budget as a fine piece\r\nof statecraft. Its production was certainly a very unexpected display\r\nof vigour on the Liberal side. But, on the whole, this movement\r\ntowards collectivist organisation on the part of the Liberals rather\r\nstrengthened than weakened my resolve to cross the floor of the house.\r\nIt made it more necessary, I thought, to leaven the purely obstructive\r\nand reactionary elements that were at once manifest in the opposition. I\r\nassailed the land taxation proposals in one main speech, and a series\r\nof minor speeches in committee. The line of attack I chose was that the\r\nland was a great public service that needed to be controlled on broad\r\nand far-sighted lines. I had no objection to its nationalisation, but I\r\ndid object most strenuously to the idea of leaving it in private hands,\r\nand attempting to produce beneficial social results through the pressure\r\nof taxation upon the land-owning class. That might break it up in an\r\nutterly disastrous way. The drift of the government proposals was all in\r\nthe direction of sweating the landowner to get immediate values from his\r\nproperty, and such a course of action was bound to give us an irritated\r\nand vindictive land-owning class, the class upon which we had hitherto\r\nrelied--not unjustifiably--for certain broad, patriotic services and\r\nan influence upon our collective judgments that no other class seemed\r\nprepared to exercise. Abolish landlordism if you will, I said, buy\r\nit out, but do not drive it to a defensive fight, and leave it still\r\nsufficiently strong and wealthy to become a malcontent element in your\r\nstate. You have taxed and controlled the brewer and the publican until\r\nthe outraged Liquor Interest has become a national danger. You now\r\npropose to do the same thing on a larger scale. You turn a class which\r\nhas many fine and truly aristocratic traditions towards revolt, and\r\nthere is nothing in these or any other of your proposals that shows any\r\nsense of the need for leadership to replace these traditional leaders\r\nyou are ousting. This was the substance of my case, and I hammered at it\r\nnot only in the House, but in the press....\r\n\r\nThe Kinghampstead division remained for some time insensitive to my\r\ndefection.\r\n\r\nThen it woke up suddenly, and began, in the columns of the\r\nKINGSHAMPSTEAD GUARDIAN, an indignant, confused outcry. I was treated to\r\nan open letter, signed “Junius Secundus,” and I replied in provocative\r\nterms. There were two thinly attended public meetings at different ends\r\nof the constituency, and then I had a correspondence with my old friend\r\nParvill, the photographer, which ended in my seeing a deputation.\r\n\r\nMy impression is that it consisted of about eighteen or twenty people.\r\nThey had had to come upstairs to me and they were manifestly full of\r\nindignation and a little short of breath. There was Parvill himself,\r\nJ.P., dressed wholly in black--I think to mark his sense of the\r\noccasion--and curiously suggestive in his respect for my character and\r\nhis concern for the honourableness of the KINGHAMPSTEAD GUARDIAN editor,\r\nof Mark Antony at the funeral of Cesar. There was Mrs. Bulger, also in\r\nmourning; she had never abandoned the widow's streamers since the death\r\nof her husband ten years ago, and her loyalty to Liberalism of the\r\nseverest type was part as it were of her weeds. There was a nephew of\r\nSir Roderick Newton, a bright young Hebrew of the graver type, and a\r\ncouple of dissenting ministers in high collars and hats that stopped\r\nhalfway between the bowler of this world and the shovel-hat of heaven.\r\nThere was also a young solicitor from Lurky done in the horsey style,\r\nand there was a very little nervous man with a high brow and a face\r\ncontracting below as though the jawbones and teeth had been taken out\r\nand the features compressed. The rest of the deputation, which included\r\ntwo other public-spirited ladies and several ministers of religion,\r\nmight have been raked out of any omnibus going Strandward during the\r\nMay meetings. They thrust Parvill forward as spokesman, and manifested\r\na strong disposition to say “Hear, hear!” to his more strenuous protests\r\nprovided my eye wasn't upon them at the time.\r\n\r\nI regarded this appalling deputation as Parvill's apologetic but quite\r\ndefinite utterances drew to an end. I had a moment of vision. Behind\r\nthem I saw the wonderful array of skeleton forces that stand for public\r\nopinion, that are as much public opinion as exists indeed at the present\r\ntime. The whole process of politics which bulks so solidly in history\r\nseemed for that clairvoyant instant but a froth of petty motives above\r\nabysms of indifference....\r\n\r\nSome one had finished. I perceived I had to speak.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” I said, “I won't keep you long in replying. I'll resign if\r\nthere isn't a dissolution before next February, and if there is I shan't\r\nstand again. You don't want the bother and expense of a bye-election\r\n(approving murmurs) if it can be avoided. But I may tell you plainly now\r\nthat I don't think it will be necessary for me to resign, and the sooner\r\nyou find my successor the better for the party. The Lords are in a\r\ncorner; they've got to fight now or never, and I think they will throw\r\nout the Budget. Then they will go on fighting. It is a fight that will\r\nlast for years. They have a sort of social discipline, and you haven't.\r\nYou Liberals will find yourselves with a country behind you, vaguely\r\nindignant perhaps, but totally unprepared with any ideas whatever in\r\nthe matter, face to face with the problem of bringing the British\r\nconstitution up-to-date. Anything may happen, provided only that it is\r\nsufficiently absurd. If the King backs the Lords--and I don't see why he\r\nshouldn't--you have no Republican movement whatever to fall back\r\nupon. You lost it during the Era of Good Taste. The country, I say, is\r\ndestitute of ideas, and you have no ideas to give it. I don't see what\r\nyou will do.... For my own part, I mean to spend a year or so between a\r\nwindow and my writing-desk.”\r\n\r\nI paused. “I think, gentlemen,” began Parvill, “that we hear all this\r\nwith very great regret....”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\nMy estrangement from Margaret stands in my memory now as something that\r\nplayed itself out within the four walls of our house in Radnor Square,\r\nwhich was, indeed, confined to those limits. I went to and fro between\r\nmy house and the House of Commons, and the dining-rooms and clubs and\r\noffices in which we were preparing our new developments, in a state\r\nof aggressive and energetic dissociation, in the nascent state, as a\r\nchemist would say. I was free now, and greedy for fresh combination. I\r\nhad a tremendous sense of released energies. I had got back to the sort\r\nof thing I could do, and to the work that had been shaping itself for\r\nso long in my imagination. Our purpose now was plain, bold, and\r\nextraordinarily congenial. We meant no less than to organise a new\r\nmovement in English thought and life, to resuscitate a Public Opinion\r\nand prepare the ground for a revised and renovated ruling culture.\r\n\r\nFor a time I seemed quite wonderfully able to do whatever I wanted to\r\ndo. Shoesmith responded to my first advances. We decided to create a\r\nweekly paper as our nucleus, and Crupp and I set to work forthwith to\r\ncollect a group of writers and speakers, including Esmeer, Britten, Lord\r\nGane, Neal, and one or two younger men, which should constitute a more\r\nor less definite editorial council about me, and meet at a weekly lunch\r\non Tuesday to sustain our general co-operations. We marked our claim\r\nupon Toryism even in the colour of our wrapper, and spoke of ourselves\r\ncollectively as the Blue Weeklies. But our lunches were open to all\r\nsorts of guests, and our deliberations were never of a character to\r\ncontrol me effectively in my editorial decisions. My only influential\r\ncouncillor at first was old Britten, who became my sub-editor. It was\r\ncurious how we two had picked up our ancient intimacy again and resumed\r\nthe easy give and take of our speculative dreaming schoolboy days.\r\n\r\nFor a time my life centred altogether upon this journalistic work.\r\nBritten was an experienced journalist, and I had most of the necessary\r\ninstincts for the business. We meant to make the paper right and\r\ngood down to the smallest detail, and we set ourselves at this with\r\nextraordinary zeal. It wasn't our intention to show our political\r\nmotives too markedly at first, and through all the dust storm and\r\ntumult and stress of the political struggle of 1910, we made a little\r\nintellectual oasis of good art criticism and good writing. It was the\r\nfirm belief of nearly all of us that the Lords were destined to be\r\nbeaten badly in 1910, and our game was the longer game of reconstruction\r\nthat would begin when the shouting and tumult of that immediate conflict\r\nwere over. Meanwhile we had to get into touch with just as many good\r\nminds as possible.\r\n\r\nAs we felt our feet, I developed slowly and carefully a broadly\r\nconceived and consistent political attitude. As I will explain later,\r\nwe were feminist from the outset, though that caused Shoesmith and Gane\r\ngreat searching of heart; we developed Esmeer's House of Lords reform\r\nscheme into a general cult of the aristocratic virtues, and we did much\r\nto humanise and liberalise the narrow excellencies of that Break-up of\r\nthe Poor Law agitation, which had been organised originally by Beatrice\r\nand Sidney Webb. In addition, without any very definite explanation to\r\nany one but Esmeer and Isabel Rivers, and as if it was quite a small\r\nmatter, I set myself to secure a uniform philosophical quality in our\r\ncolumns.\r\n\r\nThat, indeed, was the peculiar virtue and characteristic of the BLUE\r\nWEEKLY. I was now very definitely convinced that much of the confusion\r\nand futility of contemporary thought was due to the general need of\r\nmetaphysical training.... The great mass of people--and not simply\r\ncommon people, but people active and influential in intellectual\r\nthings--are still quite untrained in the methods of thought and\r\nabsolutely innocent of any criticism of method; it is scarcely a\r\ncaricature to call their thinking a crazy patchwork, discontinuous and\r\nchaotic. They arrive at conclusions by a kind of accident, and do not\r\nsuspect any other way may be found to their attainment. A stage above\r\nthis general condition stands that minority of people who have at\r\nsome time or other discovered general terms and a certain use\r\nfor generalisations. They are--to fall back on the ancient\r\ntechnicality--Realists of a crude sort. When I say Realist of course\r\nI mean Realist as opposed to Nominalist, and not Realist in the almost\r\ndiametrically different sense of opposition to Idealist. Such are the\r\nBaileys; such, to take their great prototype, was Herbert Spencer (who\r\ncouldn't read Kant); such are whole regiments of prominent and entirely\r\nself-satisfied contemporaries. They go through queer little processes of\r\ndefinition and generalisation and deduction with the completest belief\r\nin the validity of the intellectual instrument they are using. They are\r\nRealists--Cocksurists--in matter of fact; sentimentalists in behaviour.\r\nThe Baileys having got to this glorious stage in mental development--it\r\nis glorious because it has no doubts--were always talking about training\r\n“Experts” to apply the same simple process to all the affairs\r\nof mankind. Well, Realism isn't the last word of human wisdom.\r\nModest-minded people, doubtful people, subtle people, and the like--the\r\nkind of people William James writes of as “tough-minded,” go on beyond\r\nthis methodical happiness, and are forever after critical of premises\r\nand terms. They are truer--and less confident. They have reached\r\nscepticism and the artistic method. They have emerged into the new\r\nNominalism.\r\n\r\nBoth Isabel and I believe firmly that these differences of intellectual\r\nmethod matter profoundly in the affairs of mankind, that the collective\r\nmind of this intricate complex modern state can only function properly\r\nupon neo-Nominalist lines. This has always been her side of our mental\r\nco-operation rather than mine. Her mind has the light movement that\r\ngoes so often with natural mental power; she has a wonderful art in\r\nillustration, and, as the reader probably knows already, she writes of\r\nmetaphysical matters with a rare charm and vividness. So far there has\r\nbeen no collection of her papers published, but they are to be found not\r\nonly in the BLUE WEEKLY columns but scattered about the monthlies; many\r\npeople must be familiar with her style. It was an intention we did\r\nmuch to realise before our private downfall, that we would use the BLUE\r\nWEEKLY to maintain a stream of suggestion against crude thinking, and\r\nat last scarcely a week passed but some popular distinction, some\r\nlarge imposing generalisation, was touched to flaccidity by her pen or\r\nmine....\r\n\r\nI was at great pains to give my philosophical, political, and social\r\nmatter the best literary and critical backing we could get in London. I\r\nhunted sedulously for good descriptive writing and good criticism; I\r\nwas indefatigable in my readiness to hear and consider, if not to accept\r\nadvice; I watched every corner of the paper, and had a dozen men alert\r\nto get me special matter of the sort that draws in the unattached\r\nreader. The chief danger on the literary side of a weekly is that it\r\nshould fall into the hands of some particular school, and this I watched\r\nfor closely. It seems impossible to get vividness of apprehension and\r\nbreadth of view together in the same critic. So it falls to the wise\r\neditor to secure the first and impose the second. Directly I detected\r\nthe shrill partisan note in our criticism, the attempt to puff a poor\r\nthing because it was “in the right direction,” or damn a vigorous piece\r\nof work because it wasn't, I tackled the man and had it out with him.\r\nOur pay was good enough for that to matter a good deal....\r\n\r\nOur distinctive little blue and white poster kept up its neat persistent\r\nappeal to the public eye, and before 1911 was out, the BLUE WEEKLY was\r\nprinting twenty pages of publishers' advertisements, and went into\r\nall the clubs in London and three-quarters of the country houses where\r\nweek-end parties gather together. Its sale by newsagents and bookstalls\r\ngrew steadily. One got more and more the reassuring sense of being\r\ndiscussed, and influencing discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\nOur office was at the very top of a big building near the end of Adelphi\r\nTerrace; the main window beside my desk, a big undivided window of\r\nplate glass, looked out upon Cleopatra's Needle, the corner of the Hotel\r\nCecil, the fine arches of Waterloo Bridge, and the long sweep of south\r\nbank with its shot towers and chimneys, past Bankside to the dimly seen\r\npiers of the great bridge below the Tower. The dome of St. Paul's just\r\nfloated into view on the left against the hotel facade. By night and\r\nday, in every light and atmosphere, it was a beautiful and various view,\r\nalive as a throbbing heart; a perpetual flow of traffic ploughed and\r\nsplashed the streaming silver of the river, and by night the shapes of\r\nthings became velvet black and grey, and the water a shining mirror\r\nof steel, wearing coruscating gems of light. In the foreground the\r\nEmbankment trams sailed glowing by, across the water advertisements\r\nflashed and flickered, trains went and came and a rolling drift of smoke\r\nreflected unseen fires. By day that spectacle was sometimes a marvel of\r\nshining wet and wind-cleared atmosphere, sometimes a mystery of drifting\r\nfog, sometimes a miracle of crowded details, minutely fine.\r\n\r\nAs I think of that view, so variously spacious in effect, I am back\r\nthere, and this sunlit paper might be lamp-lit and lying on my old desk.\r\nI see it all again, feel it all again. In the foreground is a green\r\nshaded lamp and crumpled galley slips and paged proofs and letters, two\r\nor three papers in manuscript, and so forth. In the shadows are chairs\r\nand another table bearing papers and books, a rotating bookcase dimly\r\nseen, a long window seat black in the darkness, and then the cool\r\nunbroken spectacle of the window. How often I would watch some tram-car,\r\nsome string of barges go from me slowly out of sight. The people were\r\nblack animalculae by day, clustering, collecting, dispersing, by night,\r\nthey were phantom face-specks coming, vanishing, stirring obscurely\r\nbetween light and shade.\r\n\r\nI recall many hours at my desk in that room before the crisis came,\r\nhours full of the peculiar happiness of effective strenuous work. Once\r\nsome piece of writing went on, holding me intent and forgetful of time\r\nuntil I looked up from the warm circle of my electric lamp to see the\r\neastward sky above the pale silhouette of the Tower Bridge, flushed and\r\nbanded brightly with the dawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FOURTH ~~ THE BESETTING OF SEX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nArt is selection and so is most autobiography. But I am concerned with a\r\nmore tangled business than selection, I want to show a contemporary man\r\nin relation to the state and social usage, and the social organism in\r\nrelation to that man. To tell my story at all I have to simplify. I have\r\ngiven now the broad lines of my political development, and how I passed\r\nfrom my initial liberal-socialism to the conception of a constructive\r\naristocracy. I have tried to set that out in the form of a man\r\ndiscovering himself. Incidentally that self-development led to a\r\nprofound breach with my wife. One has read stories before of husband\r\nand wife speaking severally two different languages and coming to an\r\nunderstanding. But Margaret and I began in her dialect, and, as I came\r\nmore and more to use my own, diverged.\r\n\r\nI had thought when I married that the matter of womankind had ended for\r\nme. I have tried to tell all that sex and women had been to me up to my\r\nmarried life with Margaret and our fatal entanglement, tried to show the\r\nqueer, crippled, embarrassed and limited way in which these interests\r\nbreak upon the life of a young man under contemporary conditions. I\r\ndo not think my lot was a very exceptional one. I missed the chance of\r\nsisters and girl playmates, but that is not an uncommon misadventure\r\nin an age of small families; I never came to know any woman at all\r\nintimately until I was married to Margaret. My earlier love affairs were\r\nencounters of sex, under conditions of furtiveness and adventure that\r\nmade them things in themselves, restricted and unilluminating. From a\r\nboyish disposition to be mystical and worshipping towards women I\r\nhad passed into a disregardful attitude, as though women were things\r\ninferior or irrelevant, disturbers in great affairs. For a time Margaret\r\nhad blotted out all other women; she was so different and so near;\r\nshe was like a person who stands suddenly in front of a little window\r\nthrough which one has been surveying a crowd. She didn't become\r\nwomankind for me so much as eliminate womankind from my world.... And\r\nthen came this secret separation....\r\n\r\nUntil this estrangement and the rapid and uncontrollable development of\r\nmy relations with Isabel which chanced to follow it, I seemed to have\r\nsolved the problem of women by marriage and disregard. I thought these\r\nthings were over. I went about my career with Margaret beside me, her\r\nbrow slightly knit, her manner faintly strenuous, helping, helping; and\r\nif we had not altogether abolished sex we had at least so circumscribed\r\nand isolated it that it would not have affected the general tenor of our\r\nlives in the slightest degree if we had.\r\n\r\nAnd then, clothing itself more and more in the form of Isabel and her\r\nproblems, this old, this fundamental obsession of my life returned. The\r\nthing stole upon my mind so that I was unaware of its invasion and how\r\nit was changing our long intimacy. I have already compared the lot of\r\nthe modern publicist to Machiavelli writing in his study; in his day\r\nwomen and sex were as disregarded in these high affairs as, let us say,\r\nthe chemistry of air or the will of the beasts in the fields; in ours\r\nthe case has altogether changed, and woman has come now to stand beside\r\nthe tall candles, half in the light, half in the mystery of the\r\nshadows, besetting, interrupting, demanding unrelentingly an altogether\r\nunprecedented attention. I feel that in these matters my life has been\r\nalmost typical of my time. Woman insists upon her presence. She is\r\nno longer a mere physical need, an aesthetic bye-play, a sentimental\r\nbackground; she is a moral and intellectual necessity in a man's life.\r\nShe comes to the politician and demands, Is she a child or a citizen? Is\r\nshe a thing or a soul? She comes to the individual man, as she came\r\nto me and asks, Is she a cherished weakling or an equal mate, an\r\nunavoidable helper? Is she to be tried and trusted or guarded and\r\ncontrolled, bond or free? For if she is a mate, one must at once trust\r\nmore and exact more, exacting toil, courage, and the hardest, most\r\nnecessary thing of all, the clearest, most shameless, explicitness of\r\nunderstanding....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all my earlier imaginings of statecraft I had tacitly assumed either\r\nthat the relations of the sexes were all right or that anyhow they\r\ndidn't concern the state. It was a matter they, whoever “they” were, had\r\nto settle among themselves. That sort of disregard was possible then.\r\nBut even before 1906 there were endless intimations that the dams\r\nholding back great reservoirs of discussion were crumbling. We political\r\nschemers were ploughing wider than any one had ploughed before in the\r\nfield of social reconstruction. We had also, we realised, to plough\r\ndeeper. We had to plough down at last to the passionate elements of\r\nsexual relationship and examine and decide upon them.\r\n\r\nThe signs multiplied. In a year or so half the police of the metropolis\r\nwere scarce sufficient to protect the House from one clamorous aspect\r\nof the new problem. The members went about Westminster with an odd, new\r\nsense of being beset. A good proportion of us kept up the pretence that\r\nthe Vote for Women was an isolated fad, and the agitation an epidemic\r\nmadness that would presently pass. But it was manifest to any one who\r\nsought more than comfort in the matter that the streams of women and\r\nsympathisers and money forthcoming marked far deeper and wider things\r\nthan an idle fancy for the franchise. The existing laws and conventions\r\nof relationship between Man and Woman were just as unsatisfactory a\r\ndisorder as anything else in our tumbled confusion of a world, and that\r\nalso was coming to bear upon statecraft.\r\n\r\nMy first parliament was the parliament of the Suffragettes. I don't\r\npropose to tell here of that amazing campaign, with its absurdities\r\nand follies, its courage and devotion. There were aspects of that\r\nunquenchable agitation that were absolutely heroic and aspects that were\r\nabsolutely pitiful. It was unreasonable, unwise, and, except for its\r\none central insistence, astonishingly incoherent. It was amazingly\r\neffective. The very incoherence of the demand witnessed, I think, to the\r\nforces that lay behind it. It wasn't a simple argument based on a\r\nsimple assumption; it was the first crude expression of a great mass and\r\nmingling of convergent feelings, of a widespread, confused persuasion\r\namong modern educated women that the conditions of their relations with\r\nmen were oppressive, ugly, dishonouring, and had to be altered. They\r\nhad not merely adopted the Vote as a symbol of equality; it was fairly\r\nmanifest to me that, given it, they meant to use it, and to use it\r\nperhaps even vindictively and blindly, as a weapon against many things\r\nthey had every reason to hate....\r\n\r\nI remember, with exceptional vividness, that great night early in the\r\nsession of 1909, when--I think it was--fifty or sixty women went to\r\nprison. I had been dining at the Barham's, and Lord Barham and I came\r\ndown from the direction of St. James's Park into a crowd and a confusion\r\noutside the Caxton Hall. We found ourselves drifting with an immense\r\nmultitude towards Parliament Square and parallel with a silent,\r\nclose-packed column of girls and women, for the most part white-faced\r\nand intent. I still remember the effect of their faces upon me. It was\r\nquite different from the general effect of staring about and divided\r\nattention one gets in a political procession of men. There was an\r\nexpression of heroic tension.\r\n\r\nThere had been a pretty deliberate appeal on the part of the women's\r\norganisers to the Unemployed, who had been demonstrating throughout that\r\nwinter, to join forces with the movement, and the result was shown\r\nin the quality of the crowd upon the pavement. It was an ugly,\r\ndangerous-looking crowd, but as yet good-tempered and sympathetic. When\r\nat last we got within sight of the House the square was a seething seat\r\nof excited people, and the array of police on horse and on foot might\r\nhave been assembled for a revolutionary outbreak. There were dense\r\nmasses of people up Whitehall, and right on to Westminster Bridge. The\r\nscuffle that ended in the arrests was the poorest explosion to follow\r\nsuch stupendous preparations....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nLater on in that year the women began a new attack. Day and night, and\r\nall through the long nights of the Budget sittings, at all the piers\r\nof the gates of New Palace Yard and at St. Stephen's Porch, stood women\r\npickets, and watched us silently and reproachfully as we went to and\r\nfro. They were women of all sorts, though, of course, the independent\r\nworker-class predominated. There were grey-headed old ladies standing\r\nthere, sturdily charming in the rain; battered-looking, ambiguous women,\r\nwith something of the desperate bitterness of battered women showing in\r\ntheir eyes; north-country factory girls; cheaply-dressed suburban women;\r\ntrim, comfortable mothers of families; valiant-eyed girl graduates\r\nand undergraduates; lank, hungry-looking creatures, who stirred one's\r\nimagination; one very dainty little woman in deep mourning, I recall,\r\ngrave and steadfast, with eyes fixed on distant things. Some of those\r\nwomen looked defiant, some timidly aggressive, some full of the stir of\r\nadventure, some drooping with cold and fatigue. The supply never ceased.\r\nI had a mortal fear that somehow the supply might halt or cease. I\r\nfound that continual siege of the legislature extraordinarily\r\nimpressive--infinitely more impressive than the feeble-forcible\r\n“ragging” of the more militant section. I thought of the appeal that\r\nmust be going through the country, summoning the women from countless\r\nscattered homes, rooms, colleges, to Westminster.\r\n\r\nI remember too the petty little difficulty I felt whether I should\r\nignore these pickets altogether, or lift a hat as I hurried past with\r\naverted eyes, or look them in the face as I did so. Towards the end the\r\nHouse evoked an etiquette of salutation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a tendency, even on the part of its sympathisers, to treat the\r\nwhole suffrage agitation as if it were a disconnected issue, irrelevant\r\nto all other broad developments of social and political life. We\r\nstruggled, all of us, to ignore the indicating finger it thrust out\r\nbefore us. “Your schemes, for all their bigness,” it insisted to\r\nour reluctant, averted minds, “still don't go down to the essential\r\nthings....”\r\n\r\nWe have to go deeper, or our inadequate children's insufficient children\r\nwill starve amidst harvests of earless futility. That conservatism which\r\nworks in every class to preserve in its essentials the habitual daily\r\nlife is all against a profounder treatment of political issues. The\r\npolitician, almost as absurdly as the philosopher, tends constantly, in\r\nspite of magnificent preludes, vast intimations, to specialise himself\r\nout of the reality he has so stupendously summoned--he bolts back to\r\nlittleness. The world has to be moulded anew, he continues to admit, but\r\nwithout, he adds, any risk of upsetting his week-end visits, his morning\r\ncup of tea....\r\n\r\nThe discussion of the relations of men and women disturbs every one. It\r\nreacts upon the private life of every one who attempts it. And at\r\nany particular time only a small minority have a personal interest in\r\nchanging the established state of affairs. Habit and interest are in a\r\nconstantly recruited majority against conscious change and adjustment\r\nin these matters. Drift rules us. The great mass of people, and an\r\noverwhelming proportion of influential people, are people who have\r\nbanished their dreams and made their compromise. Wonderful and beautiful\r\npossibilities are no longer to be thought about. They have given up\r\nany aspirations for intense love, their splendid offspring, for keen\r\ndelights, have accepted a cultivated kindliness and an uncritical sense\r\nof righteousness as their compensation. It's a settled affair with\r\nthem, a settled, dangerous affair. Most of them fear, and many hate, the\r\nslightest reminder of those abandoned dreams. As Dayton once said to\r\nthe Pentagram Circle, when we were discussing the problem of a universal\r\nmarriage and divorce law throughout the Empire, “I am for leaving all\r\nthese things alone.” And then, with a groan in his voice, “Leave them\r\nalone! Leave them all alone!”\r\n\r\nThat was his whole speech for the evening, in a note of suppressed\r\npassion, and presently, against all our etiquette, he got up and went\r\nout.\r\n\r\nFor some years after my marriage, I too was for leaving them alone. I\r\ndeveloped a dread and dislike for romance, for emotional music, for the\r\nhuman figure in art--turning my heart to landscape. I wanted to sneer\r\nat lovers and their ecstasies, and was uncomfortable until I found\r\nthe effective sneer. In matters of private morals these were my most\r\nuncharitable years. I didn't want to think of these things any more for\r\never. I hated the people whose talk or practice showed they were not\r\nof my opinion. I wanted to believe that their views were immoral and\r\nobjectionable and contemptible, because I had decided to treat them as\r\nat that level. I was, in fact, falling into the attitude of the normal\r\ndecent man.\r\n\r\nAnd yet one cannot help thinking! The sensible moralised man finds it\r\nhard to escape the stream of suggestion that there are still dreams\r\nbeyond these commonplace acquiescences,--the appeal of beauty suddenly\r\nshining upon one, the mothlike stirrings of serene summer nights, the\r\nsweetness of distant music....\r\n\r\nIt is one of the paradoxical factors in our public life at the present\r\ntime, which penalises abandonment to love so abundantly and so heavily,\r\nthat power, influence and control fall largely to unencumbered people\r\nand sterile people and people who have married for passionless purposes,\r\npeople whose very deficiency in feeling has left them free to follow\r\nambition, people beautyblind, who don't understand what it is to fall in\r\nlove, what it is to desire children or have them, what it is to feel in\r\ntheir blood and bodies the supreme claim of good births and selective\r\nbirths above all other affairs in life, people almost of necessity\r\naverse from this most fundamental aspect of existence....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\nIt wasn't, however, my deepening sympathy with and understanding of the\r\nposition of women in general, or the change in my ideas about all these\r\nintimate things my fast friendship with Isabel was bringing about, that\r\nled me to the heretical views I have in the last five years dragged from\r\nthe region of academic and timid discussion into the field of practical\r\npolitics. Those influences, no doubt, have converged to the same end,\r\nand given me a powerful emotional push upon my road, but it was a\r\nbroader and colder view of things that first determined me in my attempt\r\nto graft the Endowment of Motherhood in some form or other upon British\r\nImperialism. Now that I am exiled from the political world, it is\r\npossible to estimate just how effectually that grafting has been done.\r\n\r\nI have explained how the ideas of a trained aristocracy and a universal\r\neducation grew to paramount importance in my political scheme. It is but\r\na short step from this to the question of the quantity and quality of\r\nbirths in the community, and from that again to these forbidden and\r\nfear-beset topics of marriage, divorce, and the family organisation.\r\nA sporadic discussion of these aspects had been going on for years, a\r\nEugenic society existed, and articles on the Falling Birth Rate, and the\r\nRapid Multiplication of the Unfit were staples of the monthly magazines.\r\nBut beyond an intermittent scolding of prosperous childless people\r\nin general--one never addressed them in particular--nothing was done\r\ntowards arresting those adverse processes. Almost against my natural\r\ninclination, I found myself forced to go into these things. I came to\r\nthe conclusion that under modern conditions the isolated private family,\r\nbased on the existing marriage contract, was failing in its work. It\r\nwasn't producing enough children, and children good enough and well\r\ntrained enough for the demands of the developing civilised state.\r\nOur civilisation was growing outwardly, and decaying in its intimate\r\nsubstance, and unless it was presently to collapse, some very extensive\r\nand courageous reorganisation was needed. The old haphazard system\r\nof pairing, qualified more and more by worldly discretions, no longer\r\nsecures a young population numerous enough or good enough for the\r\ngrowing needs and possibilities of our Empire. Statecraft sits weaving\r\nsplendid garments, no doubt, but with a puny, ugly, insufficient baby in\r\nthe cradle.\r\n\r\nNo one so far has dared to take up this problem as a present question\r\nfor statecraft, but it comes unheralded, unadvocated, and sits at\r\nevery legislative board. Every improvement is provisional except the\r\nimprovement of the race, and it became more and more doubtful to me if\r\nwe were improving the race at all! Splendid and beautiful and courageous\r\npeople must come together and have children, women with their fine\r\nsenses and glorious devotion must be freed from the net that compels\r\nthem to be celibate, compels them to be childless and useless, or to\r\nbear children ignobly to men whom need and ignorance and the treacherous\r\npressure of circumstances have forced upon them. We all know that,\r\nand so few dare even to whisper it for fear that they should seem, in\r\nseeking to save the family, to threaten its existence. It is as if\r\na party of pigmies in a not too capacious room had been joined by a\r\ncarnivorous giant--and decided to go on living happily by cutting him\r\ndead....\r\n\r\nThe problem the developing civilised state has to solve is how it can\r\nget the best possible increase under the best possible conditions.\r\nI became more and more convinced that the independent family unit\r\nof to-day, in which the man is master of the wife and owner of the\r\nchildren, in which all are dependent upon him, subordinated to his\r\nenterprises and liable to follow his fortunes up or down, does not\r\nsupply anything like the best conceivable conditions. We want to\r\nmodernise the family footing altogether. An enormous premium both in\r\npleasure and competitive efficiency is put upon voluntary childlessness,\r\nand enormous inducements are held out to women to subordinate\r\ninstinctive and selective preferences to social and material\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\nThe practical reaction of modern conditions upon the old tradition of\r\nthe family is this: that beneath the pretence that nothing is changing,\r\nsecretly and with all the unwholesomeness of secrecy everything is\r\nchanged. Offspring fall away, the birth rate falls and falls most among\r\njust the most efficient and active and best adapted classes in the\r\ncommunity. The species is recruited from among its failures and from\r\namong less civilised aliens. Contemporary civilisations are in effect\r\nburning the best of their possible babies in the furnaces that run the\r\nmachinery. In the United States the native Anglo-American strain has\r\nscarcely increased at all since 1830, and in most Western European\r\ncountries the same is probably true of the ablest and most energetic\r\nelements in the community. The women of these classes still remain\r\nlegally and practically dependent and protected, with the only natural\r\nexcuse for their dependence gone....\r\n\r\nThe modern world becomes an immense spectacle of unsatisfactory\r\ngroupings; here childless couples bored to death in the hopeless effort\r\nto sustain an incessant honeymoon, here homes in which a solitary child\r\ngrows unsocially, here small two or three-child homes that do no more\r\nthan continue the culture of the parents at a great social cost, here\r\nnumbers of unhappy educated but childless married women, here careless,\r\ndecivilised fecund homes, here orphanages and asylums for the heedlessly\r\nbegotten. It is just the disorderly proliferation of Bromstead over\r\nagain, in lives instead of in houses.\r\n\r\nWhat is the good, what is the common sense, of rectifying boundaries,\r\npushing research and discovery, building cities, improving all the\r\nfacilities of life, making great fleets, waging wars, while this aimless\r\ndecadence remains the quality of the biological outlook?...\r\n\r\nIt is difficult now to trace how I changed from my early aversion until\r\nI faced this mass of problems. But so far back as 1910 I had it clear\r\nin my mind that I would rather fail utterly than participate in all the\r\nsurrenders of mind and body that are implied in Dayton's snarl of “Leave\r\nit alone; leave it all alone!” Marriage and the begetting and care of\r\nchildren, is the very ground substance in the life of the community.\r\nIn a world in which everything changes, in which fresh methods, fresh\r\nadjustments and fresh ideas perpetually renew the circumstances of life,\r\nit is preposterous that we should not even examine into these matters,\r\nshould rest content to be ruled by the uncriticised traditions of a\r\nbarbaric age.\r\n\r\nNow, it seems to me that the solution of this problem is also the\r\nsolution of the woman's individual problem. The two go together, are\r\nright and left of one question. The only conceivable way out from our\r\nIMPASSE lies in the recognition of parentage, that is to say of adequate\r\nmothering, as no longer a chance product of individual passions but\r\na service rendered to the State. Women must become less and less\r\nsubordinated to individual men, since this works out in a more or less\r\ncomplete limitation, waste, and sterilisation of their essentially\r\nsocial function; they must become more and more subordinated as\r\nindividually independent citizens to the collective purpose. Or, to\r\nexpress the thing by a familiar phrase, the highly organised, scientific\r\nstate we desire must, if it is to exist at all, base itself not upon\r\nthe irresponsible man-ruled family, but upon the matriarchal family,\r\nthe citizen-ship and freedom of women and the public endowment of\r\nmotherhood.\r\n\r\nAfter two generations of confused and experimental revolt it grows clear\r\nto modern women that a conscious, deliberate motherhood and mothering is\r\ntheir special function in the State, and that a personal subordination\r\nto an individual man with an unlimited power of control over this\r\nintimate and supreme duty is a degradation. No contemporary woman of\r\neducation put to the test is willing to recognise any claim a man can\r\nmake upon her but the claim of her freely-given devotion to him. She\r\nwants the reality of her choice and she means “family” while a man\r\ntoo often means only possession. This alters the spirit of the family\r\nrelationships fundamentally. Their form remains just what it was\r\nwhen woman was esteemed a pretty, desirable, and incidentally a\r\nchild-producing, chattel. Against these time-honoured ideas the new\r\nspirit of womanhood struggles in shame, astonishment, bitterness, and\r\ntears....\r\n\r\nI confess myself altogether feminist. I have no doubts in the matter.\r\nI want this coddling and browbeating of women to cease. I want to\r\nsee women come in, free and fearless, to a full participation in the\r\ncollective purpose of mankind. Women, I am convinced, are as fine\r\nas men; they can be as wise as men; they are capable of far greater\r\ndevotion than men. I want to see them citizens, with a marriage law\r\nframed primarily for them and for their protection and the good of the\r\nrace, and not for men's satisfactions. I want to see them bearing and\r\nrearing good children in the State as a generously rewarded public duty\r\nand service, choosing their husbands freely and discerningly, and in no\r\nway enslaved by or subordinated to the men they have chosen. The social\r\nconsciousness of women seems to me an unworked, an almost untouched mine\r\nof wealth for the constructive purpose of the world. I want to change\r\nthe respective values of the family group altogether, and make the home\r\nindeed the women's kingdom and the mother the owner and responsible\r\nguardian of her children.\r\n\r\nIt is no use pretending that this is not novel and revolutionary; it is.\r\nThe Endowment of Motherhood implies a new method of social organization,\r\na rearrangement of the social unit, untried in human experience--as\r\nuntried as electric traction was or flying in 1800. Of course, it may\r\nwork out to modify men's ideas of marriage profoundly. To me that is\r\na secondary consideration. I do not believe that particular assertion\r\nmyself, because I am convinced that a practical monogamy is a\r\npsychological necessity to the mass of civilised people. But even if I\r\ndid believe it I should still keep to my present line, because it is the\r\nonly line that will prevent a highly organised civilisation from ending\r\nin biological decay. The public Endowment of Motherhood is the only\r\npossible way which will ensure the permanently developing civilised\r\nstate at which all constructive minds are aiming. A point is reached in\r\nthe life-history of a civilisation when either this reconstruction\r\nmust be effected or the quality and MORALE of the population prove\r\ninsufficient for the needs of the developing organisation. It is not so\r\nmuch moral decadence that will destroy us as moral inadaptability.\r\nThe old code fails under the new needs. The only alternative to this\r\nprofound reconstruction is a decay in human quality and social collapse.\r\nEither this unprecedented rearrangement must be achieved by our\r\ncivilisation, or it must presently come upon a phase of disorder and\r\ncrumble and perish, as Rome perished, as France declines, as the strain\r\nof the Pilgrim Fathers dwindles out of America. Whatever hope there may\r\nbe in the attempt therefore, there is no alternative to the attempt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\r\nI wanted political success now dearly enough, but not at the price\r\nof constructive realities. These questions were no doubt monstrously\r\ndangerous in the political world; there wasn't a politician alive who\r\ndidn't look scared at the mention of “The Family,” but if raising these\r\nissues were essential to the social reconstructions on which my life\r\nwas set, that did not matter. It only implied that I should take them\r\nup with deliberate caution. There was no release because of risk or\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nThe question of whether I should commit myself to some open project in\r\nthis direction was going on in my mind concurrently with my speculations\r\nabout a change of party, like bass and treble in a complex piece of\r\nmusic. The two drew to a conclusion together. I would not only go over\r\nto Imperialism, but I would attempt to biologise Imperialism.\r\n\r\nI thought at first that I was undertaking a monstrous uphill task.\r\nBut as I came to look into the possibilities of the matter, a strong\r\npersuasion grew up in my mind that this panic fear of legislative\r\nproposals affecting the family basis was excessive, that things were\r\nmuch riper for development in this direction than old-experienced people\r\nout of touch with the younger generation imagined, that to phrase\r\nthe thing in a parliamentary fashion, “something might be done in the\r\nconstituencies” with the Endowment of Motherhood forthwith, provided\r\nonly that it was made perfectly clear that anything a sane person could\r\npossibly intend by “morality” was left untouched by these proposals.\r\n\r\nI went to work very carefully. I got Roper of the DAILY TELEPHONE and\r\nBurkett of the DIAL to try over a silly-season discussion of State Help\r\nfor Mothers, and I put a series of articles on eugenics, upon the fall\r\nin the birth-rate, and similar topics in the BLUE WEEKLY, leading up\r\nto a tentative and generalised advocacy of the public endowment of the\r\nnation's children. I was more and more struck by the acceptance won by a\r\nsober and restrained presentation of this suggestion.\r\n\r\nAnd then, in the fourth year of the BLUE WEEKLY'S career, came the\r\nHanditch election, and I was forced by the clamour of my antagonist,\r\nand very willingly forced, to put my convictions to the test. I returned\r\ntriumphantly to Westminster with the Public Endowment of Motherhood\r\nas part of my open profession and with the full approval of the party\r\npress. Applauding benches of Imperialists cheered me on my way to the\r\ntable between the whips.\r\n\r\nThat second time I took the oath I was not one of a crowd of new\r\nmembers, but salient, an event, a symbol of profound changes and new\r\npurposes in the national life.\r\n\r\nHere it is my political book comes to an end, and in a sense my book\r\nends altogether. For the rest is but to tell how I was swept out of this\r\ngreat world of political possibilities. I close this Third Book as I\r\nopened it, with an admission of difficulties and complexities, but now\r\nwith a pile of manuscript before me I have to confess them unsurmounted\r\nand still entangled.\r\n\r\nYet my aim was a final simplicity. I have sought to show my growing\r\nrealisation that the essential quality of all political and social\r\neffort is the development of a great race mind behind the interplay of\r\nindividual lives. That is the collective human reality, the basis of\r\nmorality, the purpose of devotion. To that our lives must be given, from\r\nthat will come the perpetual fresh release and further ennoblement of\r\nindividual lives....\r\n\r\nI have wanted to make that idea of a collective mind play in this book\r\nthe part United Italy plays in Machiavelli's PRINCE. I have called it\r\nthe hinterland of reality, shown it accumulating a dominating truth and\r\nrightness which must force men's now sporadic motives more and more into\r\na disciplined and understanding relation to a plan. And I have tried\r\nto indicate how I sought to serve this great clarification of our\r\nconfusions....\r\n\r\nNow I come back to personality and the story of my self-betrayal, and\r\nhow it is I have had to leave all that far-reaching scheme of mine, a\r\nmere project and beginning for other men to take or leave as it pleases\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE FOURTH: ISABEL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FIRST ~~ LOVE AND SUCCESS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nI come to the most evasive and difficult part of my story, which is to\r\ntell how Isabel and I have made a common wreck of our joint lives.\r\n\r\nIt is not the telling of one simple disastrous accident. There was a\r\nvein in our natures that led to this collapse, gradually and at\r\nthis point and that it crept to the surface. One may indeed see our\r\ndestruction--for indeed politically we could not be more extinct if we\r\nhad been shot dead--in the form of a catastrophe as disconnected and\r\nconclusive as a meteoric stone falling out of heaven upon two friends\r\nand crushing them both. But I do not think that is true to our situation\r\nor ourselves. We were not taken by surprise. The thing was in us and\r\nnot from without, it was akin to our way of thinking and our habitual\r\nattitudes; it had, for all its impulsive effect, a certain necessity. We\r\nmight have escaped no doubt, as two men at a hundred yards may shoot at\r\neach other with pistols for a considerable time and escape. But it isn't\r\nparticularly reasonable to talk of the contrariety of fate if they both\r\nget hit.\r\n\r\nIsabel and I were dangerous to each other for several years of\r\nfriendship, and not quite unwittingly so.\r\n\r\nIn writing this, moreover, there is a very great difficulty in steering\r\nmy way between two equally undesirable tones in the telling. In the\r\nfirst place I do not want to seem to confess my sins with a penitence I\r\nam very doubtful if I feel. Now that I have got Isabel we can no doubt\r\ncount the cost of it and feel unquenchable regrets, but I am not sure\r\nwhether, if we could be put back now into such circumstances as we\r\nwere in a year ago, or two years ago, whether with my eyes fully open I\r\nshould not do over again very much as I did. And on the other hand I do\r\nnot want to justify the things we have done. We are two bad people--if\r\nthere is to be any classification of good and bad at all, we have acted\r\nbadly, and quite apart from any other considerations we've largely\r\nwasted our own very great possibilities. But it is part of a queer\r\nhumour that underlies all this, that I find myself slipping again and\r\nagain into a sentimental treatment of our case that is as unpremeditated\r\nas it is insincere. When I am a little tired after a morning's writing\r\nI find the faint suggestion getting into every other sentence that our\r\nblunders and misdeeds embodied, after the fashion of the prophet Hosea,\r\nprofound moral truths. Indeed, I feel so little confidence in my ability\r\nto keep this altogether out of my book that I warn the reader here that\r\nin spite of anything he may read elsewhere in the story, intimating\r\nhowever shyly an esoteric and exalted virtue in our proceedings, the\r\nplain truth of this business is that Isabel and I wanted each other with\r\na want entirely formless, inconsiderate, and overwhelming. And though I\r\ncould tell you countless delightful and beautiful things about Isabel,\r\nwere this a book in her praise, I cannot either analyse that want or\r\naccount for its extreme intensity.\r\n\r\nI will confess that deep in my mind there is a belief in a sort of wild\r\nrightness about any love that is fraught with beauty, but that eludes\r\nme and vanishes again, and is not, I feel, to be put with the real\r\nveracities and righteousnesses and virtues in the paddocks and\r\nmenageries of human reason....\r\n\r\nWe have already a child, and Margaret was childless, and I find myself\r\nprone to insist upon that, as if it was a justification. But, indeed,\r\nwhen we became lovers there was small thought of Eugenics between us.\r\nOurs was a mutual and not a philoprogenitive passion. Old Nature behind\r\nus may have had such purposes with us, but it is not for us to annex\r\nher intentions by a moralising afterthought. There isn't, in fact, any\r\ndecent justification for us whatever--at that the story must stand.\r\n\r\nBut if there is no justification there is at least a very effective\r\nexcuse in the mental confusedness of our time. The evasion of that\r\npassionately thorough exposition of belief and of the grounds of\r\nmorality, which is the outcome of the mercenary religious compromises of\r\nthe late Vatican period, the stupid suppression of anything but the most\r\ntimid discussion of sexual morality in our literature and drama, the\r\npervading cultivated and protected muddle-headedness, leaves mentally\r\nvigorous people with relatively enormous possibilities of destruction\r\nand little effective help. They find themselves confronted by the\r\nhabits and prejudices of manifestly commonplace people, and by that\r\nextraordinary patched-up Christianity, the cult of a “Bromsteadised”\r\n deity, diffused, scattered, and aimless, which hides from examination\r\nand any possibility of faith behind the plea of good taste. A god about\r\nwhom there is delicacy is far worse than no god at all. We are FORCED to\r\nbe laws unto ourselves and to live experimentally. It is inevitable that\r\na considerable fraction of just that bolder, more initiatory section of\r\nthe intellectual community, the section that can least be spared from\r\nthe collective life in a period of trial and change, will drift into\r\nsuch emotional crises and such disaster as overtook us. Most perhaps\r\nwill escape, but many will go down, many more than the world can spare.\r\nIt is the unwritten law of all our public life, and the same holds true\r\nof America, that an honest open scandal ends a career. England in the\r\nlast quarter of a century has wasted half a dozen statesmen on this\r\nscore; she would, I believe, reject Nelson now if he sought to serve\r\nher. Is it wonderful that to us fretting here in exile this should seem\r\nthe cruellest as well as the most foolish elimination of a necessary\r\nsocial element? It destroys no vice; for vice hides by nature. It\r\nnot only rewards dullness as if it were positive virtue, but sets an\r\nenormous premium upon hypocrisy. That is my case, and that is why I am\r\ntelling this side of my story with so much explicitness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\nEver since the Kinghamstead election I had maintained what seemed a\r\ndesultory friendship with Isabel. At first it was rather Isabel kept\r\nit up than I. Whenever Margaret and I went down to that villa, with its\r\nthree or four acres of garden and shrubbery about it, which fulfilled\r\nour election promise to live at Kinghamstead, Isabel would turn up in\r\na state of frank cheerfulness, rejoicing at us, and talk all she was\r\nreading and thinking to me, and stay for all the rest of the day. In\r\nher shameless liking for me she was as natural as a savage. She would\r\nexercise me vigorously at tennis, while Margaret lay and rested her\r\nback in the afternoon, or guide me for some long ramble that dodged the\r\nsuburban and congested patches of the constituency with amazing skill.\r\nShe took possession of me in that unabashed, straight-minded way a girl\r\nwill sometimes adopt with a man, chose my path or criticised my\r\ngame with a motherly solicitude for my welfare that was absurd and\r\ndelightful. And we talked. We discussed and criticised the stories of\r\nnovels, scraps of history, pictures, social questions, socialism, the\r\npolicy of the Government. She was young and most unevenly informed, but\r\nshe was amazingly sharp and quick and good. Never before in my life had\r\nI known a girl of her age, or a woman of her quality. I had never dreamt\r\nthere was such talk in the world. Kinghamstead became a lightless\r\nplace when she went to Oxford. Heaven knows how much that may not have\r\nprecipitated my abandonment of the seat!\r\n\r\nShe went to Ridout College, Oxford, and that certainly weighed with\r\nme when presently after my breach with the Liberals various little\r\nundergraduate societies began to ask for lectures and discussions. I\r\nfavoured Oxford. I declared openly I did so because of her. At that time\r\nI think we neither of us suspected the possibility of passion that lay\r\nlike a coiled snake in the path before us. It seemed to us that we\r\nhad the quaintest, most delightful friendship in the world; she was\r\nmy pupil, and I was her guide, philosopher, and friend. People smiled\r\nindulgently--even Margaret smiled indulgently--at our attraction for one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nSuch friendships are not uncommon nowadays--among easy-going,\r\nliberal-minded people. For the most part, there's no sort of harm, as\r\npeople say, in them. The two persons concerned are never supposed to\r\nthink of the passionate love that hovers so close to the friendship, or\r\nif they do, then they banish the thought. I think we kept the thought as\r\npermanently in exile as any one could do. If it did in odd moments come\r\ninto our heads we pretended elaborately it wasn't there.\r\n\r\nOnly we were both very easily jealous of each other's attention, and\r\ntremendously insistent upon each other's preference.\r\n\r\nI remember once during the Oxford days an intimation that should have\r\nset me thinking, and I suppose discreetly disentangling myself. It was\r\none Sunday afternoon, and it must have been about May, for the trees and\r\nshrubs of Ridout College were gay with blossom, and fresh with the new\r\nsharp greens of spring. I had walked talking with Isabel and a couple of\r\nother girls through the wide gardens of the place, seen and criticised\r\nthe new brick pond, nodded to the daughter of this friend and that\r\nin the hammocks under the trees, and picked a way among the scattered\r\ntea-parties on the lawn to our own circle on the grass under a Siberian\r\ncrab near the great bay window. There I sat and ate great quantities\r\nof cake, and discussed the tactics of the Suffragettes. I had made some\r\ncomments upon the spirit of the movement in an address to the men in\r\nPembroke, and it had got abroad, and a group of girls and women dons\r\nwere now having it out with me.\r\n\r\nI forget the drift of the conversation, or what it was made Isabel\r\ninterrupt me. She did interrupt me. She had been lying prone on the\r\nground at my right hand, chin on fists, listening thoughtfully, and\r\nI was sitting beside old Lady Evershead on a garden seat. I turned to\r\nIsabel's voice, and saw her face uplifted, and her dear cheeks and nose\r\nand forehead all splashed and barred with sunlight and the shadows of\r\nthe twigs of the trees behind me. And something--an infinite tenderness,\r\nstabbed me. It was a keen physical feeling, like nothing I had ever felt\r\nbefore. It had a quality of tears in it. For the first time in my narrow\r\nand concentrated life another human being had really thrust into my\r\nbeing and gripped my very heart.\r\n\r\nOur eyes met perplexed for an extraordinary moment. Then I turned\r\nback and addressed myself a little stiffly to the substance of her\r\nintervention. For some time I couldn't look at her again.\r\n\r\nFrom that time forth I knew I loved Isabel beyond measure.\r\n\r\nYet it is curious that it never occurred to me for a year or so that\r\nthis was likely to be a matter of passion between us. I have told how\r\ndefinitely I put my imagination into harness in those matters at my\r\nmarriage, and I was living now in a world of big interests, where there\r\nis neither much time nor inclination for deliberate love-making. I\r\nsuppose there is a large class of men who never meet a girl or a woman\r\nwithout thinking of sex, who meet a friend's daughter and decide:\r\n“Mustn't get friendly with her--wouldn't DO,” and set invisible bars\r\nbetween themselves and all the wives in the world. Perhaps that is\r\nthe way to live. Perhaps there is no other method than this effectual\r\nannihilation of half--and the most sympathetic and attractive half--of\r\nthe human beings in the world, so far as any frank intercourse is\r\nconcerned. I am quite convinced anyhow that such a qualified intimacy\r\nas ours, such a drifting into the sense of possession, such untrammeled\r\nconversation with an invisible, implacable limit set just where the\r\nintimacy glows, it is no kind of tolerable compromise. If men and women\r\nare to go so far together, they must be free to go as far as they may\r\nwant to go, without the vindictive destruction that has come upon us.\r\nOn the basis of the accepted codes the jealous people are right, and the\r\nliberal-minded ones are playing with fire. If people are not to love,\r\nthen they must be kept apart. If they are not to be kept apart, then we\r\nmust prepare for an unprecedented toleration of lovers.\r\n\r\nIsabel was as unforeseeing as I to begin with, but sex marches into the\r\nlife of an intelligent girl with demands and challenges far more urgent\r\nthan the mere call of curiosity and satiable desire that comes to a\r\nyoung man. No woman yet has dared to tell the story of that unfolding.\r\nShe attracted men, and she encouraged them, and watched them, and tested\r\nthem, and dismissed them, and concealed the substance of her thoughts\r\nabout them in the way that seems instinctive in a natural-minded girl.\r\nThere was even an engagement--amidst the protests and disapproval of\r\nthe college authorities. I never saw the man, though she gave me a long\r\nhistory of the affair, to which I listened with a forced and insincere\r\nsympathy. She struck me oddly as taking the relationship for a thing\r\nin itself, and regardless of its consequences. After a time she became\r\nsilent about him, and then threw him over; and by that time, I think,\r\nfor all that she was so much my junior, she knew more about herself and\r\nme than I was to know for several years to come.\r\n\r\nWe didn't see each other for some months after my resignation, but we\r\nkept up a frequent correspondence. She said twice over that she wanted\r\nto talk to me, that letters didn't convey what one wanted to say, and\r\nI went up to Oxford pretty definitely to see her--though I combined it\r\nwith one or two other engagements--somewhere in February. Insensibly she\r\nhad become important enough for me to make journeys for her.\r\n\r\nBut we didn't see very much of one another on that occasion. There was\r\nsomething in the air between us that made a faint embarrassment; the\r\nmere fact, perhaps, that she had asked me to come up.\r\n\r\nA year before she would have dashed off with me quite unscrupulously\r\nto talk alone, carried me off to her room for an hour with a minute of\r\nchaperonage to satisfy the rules. Now there was always some one or other\r\nnear us that it seemed impossible to exorcise.\r\n\r\nWe went for a walk on the Sunday afternoon with old Fortescue, K. C.,\r\nwho'd come up to see his two daughters, both great friends of Isabel's,\r\nand some mute inglorious don whose name I forget, but who was in a\r\nstate of marked admiration for her. The six of us played a game of\r\nconversational entanglements throughout, and mostly I was impressing\r\nthe Fortescue girls with the want of mental concentration possible in a\r\nrising politician. We went down Carfex, I remember, to Folly Bridge,\r\nand inspected the Barges, and then back by way of Merton to the Botanic\r\nGardens and Magdalen Bridge. And in the Botanic Gardens she got almost\r\nher only chance with me.\r\n\r\n“Last months at Oxford,” she said.\r\n\r\n“And then?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“I'm coming to London,” she said.\r\n\r\n“To write?”\r\n\r\nShe was silent for a moment. Then she said abruptly, with that quick\r\nflush of hers and a sudden boldness in her eyes: “I'm going to work with\r\nyou. Why shouldn't I?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, again, I suppose I had a fair warning of the drift of things.\r\nI seem to remember myself in the train to Paddington, sitting with a\r\nhandful of papers--galley proofs for the BLUE WEEKLY, I suppose--on my\r\nlap, and thinking about her and that last sentence of hers, and all that\r\nit might mean to me.\r\n\r\nIt is very hard to recall even the main outline of anything so elusive\r\nas a meditation. I know that the idea of working with her gripped me,\r\nfascinated me. That my value in her life seemed growing filled me with\r\npride and a kind of gratitude. I was already in no doubt that her value\r\nin my life was tremendous. It made it none the less, that in those days\r\nI was obsessed by the idea that she was transitory, and bound to go out\r\nof my life again. It is no good trying to set too fine a face upon this\r\ncomplex business, there is gold and clay and sunlight and savagery in\r\nevery love story, and a multitude of elvish elements peeped out beneath\r\nthe fine rich curtain of affection that masked our future. I've never\r\nproperly weighed how immensely my vanity was gratified by her clear\r\npreference for me. Nor can I for a moment determine how much deliberate\r\nintention I hide from myself in this affair.\r\n\r\nCertainly I think some part of me must have been saying in the train:\r\n“Leave go of her. Get away from her. End this now.” I can't have been so\r\nstupid as not to have had that in my mind....\r\n\r\nIf she had been only a beautiful girl in love with me, I think I could\r\nhave managed the situation. Once or twice since my marriage and before\r\nIsabel became of any significance in my life, there had been incidents\r\nwith other people, flashes of temptation--no telling is possible of\r\nthe thing resisted. I think that mere beauty and passion would not\r\nhave taken me. But between myself and Isabel things were incurably\r\ncomplicated by the intellectual sympathy we had, the jolly march of\r\nour minds together. That has always mattered enormously. I should have\r\nwanted her company nearly as badly if she had been some crippled old\r\nlady; we would have hunted shoulder to shoulder, as two men. Only two\r\nmen would never have had the patience and readiness for one another\r\nwe two had. I had never for years met any one with whom I could be so\r\ncarelessly sure of understanding or to whom I could listen so easily\r\nand fully. She gave me, with an extraordinary completeness, that rare,\r\nprecious effect of always saying something fresh, and yet saying it so\r\nthat it filled into and folded about all the little recesses and corners\r\nof my mind with an infinite, soft familiarity. It is impossible to\r\nexplain that. It is like trying to explain why her voice, her voice\r\nheard speaking to any one--heard speaking in another room--pleased my\r\nears.\r\n\r\nShe was the only Oxford woman who took a first that year. She spent the\r\nsummer in Scotland and Yorkshire, writing to me continually of all she\r\nnow meant to do, and stirring my imagination. She came to London for\r\nthe autumn session. For a time she stayed with old Lady Colbeck, but she\r\nfell out with her hostess when it became clear she wanted to write, not\r\nnovels, but journalism, and then she set every one talking by taking\r\na flat near Victoria and installing as her sole protector an elderly\r\nGerman governess she had engaged through a scholastic agency. She began\r\nwriting, not in that copious flood the undisciplined young woman of\r\ngifts is apt to produce, but in exactly the manner of an able young man,\r\nexperimenting with forms, developing the phrasing of opinions, taking\r\na definite line. She was, of course, tremendously discussed. She was\r\ndisapproved of, but she was invited out to dinner. She got rather a\r\nreputation for the management of elderly distinguished men. It was an\r\nodd experience to follow Margaret's soft rustle of silk into some\r\nbig drawing-room and discover my snub-nosed girl in the blue sack\r\ntransformed into a shining creature in the soft splendour of pearls and\r\nivory-white and lace, and with a silver band about her dusky hair.\r\n\r\nFor a time we did not meet very frequently, though always she professed\r\nan unblushing preference for my company, and talked my views and sought\r\nme out. Then her usefulness upon the BLUE WEEKLY began to link us\r\ncloselier. She would come up to the office, and sit by the window,\r\nand talk over the proofs of the next week's articles, going through my\r\nintentions with a keen investigatory scalpel. Her talk always puts me in\r\nmind of a steel blade. Her writing became rapidly very good; she had\r\na wit and a turn of the phrase that was all her own. We seemed to have\r\nforgotten the little shadow of embarrassment that had fallen over our\r\nlast meeting at Oxford. Everything seemed natural and easy between us in\r\nthose days; a little unconventional, but that made it all the brighter.\r\n\r\nWe developed something like a custom of walks, about once a week or so,\r\nand letters and notes became frequent. I won't pretend things were not\r\nkeenly personal between us, but they had an air of being innocently\r\nmental. She used to call me “Master” in our talks, a monstrous and\r\nengaging flattery, and I was inordinately proud to have her as my pupil.\r\nWho wouldn't have been? And we went on at that distance for a long\r\ntime--until within a year of the Handitch election.\r\n\r\nAfter Lady Colbeck threw her up as altogether too “intellectual” for\r\ncomfortable control, Isabel was taken up by the Balfes in a less formal\r\nand compromising manner, and week-ended with them and their cousin\r\nLeonora Sparling, and spent large portions of her summer with them in\r\nHerefordshire. There was a lover or so in that time, men who came a\r\nlittle timidly at this brilliant young person with the frank manner and\r\nthe Amazonian mind, and, she declared, received her kindly refusals with\r\nmanifest relief. And Arnold Shoesmith struck up a sort of friendship\r\nthat oddly imitated mine. She took a liking to him because he was clumsy\r\nand shy and inexpressive; she embarked upon the dangerous interest of\r\nhelping him to find his soul. I had some twinges of jealousy about that.\r\nI didn't see the necessity of him. He invaded her time, and I thought\r\nthat might interfere with her work. If their friendship stole some hours\r\nfrom Isabel's writing, it did not for a long while interfere with our\r\nwalks or our talks, or the close intimacy we had together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\nThen suddenly Isabel and I found ourselves passionately in love.\r\n\r\nThe change came so entirely without warning or intention that I find it\r\nimpossible now to tell the order of its phases. What disturbed pebble\r\nstarted the avalanche I cannot trace. Perhaps it was simply that the\r\nbarriers between us and this masked aspect of life had been wearing down\r\nunperceived.\r\n\r\nAnd there came a change in Isabel. It was like some change in the cycle\r\nof nature, like the onset of spring--a sharp brightness, an uneasiness.\r\nShe became restless with her work; little encounters with men began to\r\nhappen, encounters not quite in the quality of the earlier proposals;\r\nand then came an odd incident of which she told me, but somehow, I felt,\r\ndidn't tell me completely. She told me all she was able to tell me.\r\nShe had been at a dance at the Ropers', and a man, rather well known in\r\nLondon, had kissed her. The thing amazed her beyond measure. It was the\r\nsort of thing immediately possible between any man and any woman, that\r\none never expects to happen until it happens. It had the surprising\r\neffect of a judge generally known to be bald suddenly whipping off his\r\nwig in court. No absolutely unexpected revelation could have quite the\r\nsame quality of shock. She went through the whole thing to me with a\r\nremarkable detachment, told me how she had felt--and the odd things it\r\nseemed to open to her.\r\n\r\n“I WANT to be kissed, and all that sort of thing,” she avowed. “I\r\nsuppose every woman does.”\r\n\r\nShe added after a pause: “And I don't want any one to do it.”\r\n\r\nThis struck me as queerly expressive of the woman's attitude to these\r\nthings. “Some one presently will--solve that,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Some one will perhaps.”\r\n\r\nI was silent.\r\n\r\n“Some one will,” she said, almost viciously. “And then we'll have to\r\nstop these walks and talks of ours, dear Master.... I'll be sorry to\r\ngive them up.”\r\n\r\n“It's part of the requirements of the situation,” I said, “that he\r\nshould be--oh, very interesting! He'll start, no doubt, all sorts of new\r\ntopics, and open no end of attractive vistas.... You can't, you know,\r\nalways go about in a state of pupillage.”\r\n\r\n“I don't think I can,” said Isabel. “But it's only just recently I've\r\nbegun to doubt about it.”\r\n\r\nI remember these things being said, but just how much we saw and\r\nunderstood, and just how far we were really keeping opaque to each other\r\nthen, I cannot remember. But it must have been quite soon after this\r\nthat we spent nearly a whole day together at Kew Gardens, with the\r\ncurtains up and the barriers down, and the thing that had happened plain\r\nbefore our eyes. I don't remember we ever made any declaration. We just\r\nassumed the new footing....\r\n\r\nIt was a day early in that year--I think in January, because there was\r\nthin, crisp snow on the grass, and we noted that only two other people\r\nhad been to the Pagoda that day. I've a curious impression of greenish\r\ncolour, hot, moist air and huge palm fronds about very much of our talk,\r\nas though we were nearly all the time in the Tropical House. But I\r\nalso remember very vividly looking at certain orange and red spray-like\r\nflowers from Patagonia, which could not have been there. It is a curious\r\nthing that I do not remember we made any profession of passionate love\r\nfor one another; we talked as though the fact of our intense love for\r\neach other had always been patent between us. There was so long and\r\nfrank an intimacy between us that we talked far more like brother and\r\nsister or husband and wife than two people engaged in the war of the\r\nsexes. We wanted to know what we were going to do, and whatever we\r\ndid we meant to do in the most perfect concert. We both felt an\r\nextraordinary accession of friendship and tenderness then, and, what\r\nagain is curious, very little passion. But there was also, in spite of\r\nthe perplexities we faced, an immense satisfaction about that day. It\r\nwas as if we had taken off something that had hindered our view of each\r\nother, like people who unvizored to talk more easily at a masked ball.\r\n\r\nI've had since to view our relations from the standpoint of the ordinary\r\nobserver. I find that vision in the most preposterous contrast with all\r\nthat really went on between us. I suppose there I should figure as a\r\nwicked seducer, while an unprotected girl succumbed to my fascinations.\r\nAs a matter of fact, it didn't occur to us that there was any personal\r\ninequality between us. I knew her for my equal mentally; in so many\r\nthings she was beyond comparison cleverer than I; her courage outwent\r\nmine. The quick leap of her mind evoked a flash of joy in mine like the\r\nresponse of an induction wire; her way of thinking was like watching\r\nsunlight reflected from little waves upon the side of a boat, it was so\r\nbright, so mobile, so variously and easily true to its law. In the back\r\nof our minds we both had a very definite belief that making love is full\r\nof joyous, splendid, tender, and exciting possibilities, and we had to\r\ndiscuss why we shouldn't be to the last degree lovers.\r\n\r\nNow, what I should like to print here, if it were possible, in all the\r\nscreaming emphasis of red ink, is this: that the circumstances of my\r\nupbringing and the circumstances of Isabel's upbringing had left not a\r\nshadow of belief or feeling that the utmost passionate love between\r\nus was in itself intrinsically WRONG. I've told with the fullest\r\nparticularity just all that I was taught or found out for myself\r\nin these matters, and Isabel's reading and thinking, and the fierce\r\nsilences of her governesses and the breathless warnings of teachers, and\r\nall the social and religious influences that had been brought to bear\r\nupon her, had worked out to the same void of conviction. The code had\r\nfailed with us altogether. We didn't for a moment consider anything but\r\nthe expediency of what we both, for all our quiet faces and steady eyes,\r\nwanted most passionately to do.\r\n\r\nWell, here you have the state of mind of whole brigades of people, and\r\nparticularly of young people, nowadays. The current morality hasn't\r\ngripped them; they don't really believe in it at all. They may render\r\nit lip-service, but that is quite another thing. There are scarcely any\r\ntolerable novels to justify its prohibitions; its prohibitions do, in\r\nfact, remain unjustified amongst these ugly suppressions. You may, if\r\nyou choose, silence the admission of this in literature and current\r\ndiscussion; you will not prevent it working out in lives. People come up\r\nto the great moments of passion crudely unaware, astoundingly unprepared\r\nas no really civilised and intelligently planned community would let any\r\none be unprepared. They find themselves hedged about with customs\r\nthat have no organic hold upon them, and mere discretions all generous\r\nspirits are disposed to despise.\r\n\r\nConsider the infinite absurdities of it! Multitudes of us are trying\r\nto run this complex modern community on a basis of “Hush” without\r\nexplaining to our children or discussing with them anything about\r\nlove and marriage at all. Doubt and knowledge creep about in enforced\r\ndarknesses and silences. We are living upon an ancient tradition which\r\neverybody doubts and nobody has ever analysed. We affect a tremendous\r\nand cultivated shyness and delicacy about imperatives of the most\r\narbitrary appearance. What ensues? What did ensue with us, for example?\r\nOn the one hand was a great desire, robbed of any appearance of shame\r\nand grossness by the power of love, and on the other hand, the possible\r\njealousy of so and so, the disapproval of so and so, material risks and\r\ndangers. It is only in the retrospect that we have been able to grasp\r\nsomething of the effectual case against us. The social prohibition lit\r\nby the intense glow of our passion, presented itself as preposterous,\r\nirrational, arbitrary, and ugly, a monster fit only for mockery. We\r\nmight be ruined! Well, there is a phase in every love affair, a sort\r\nof heroic hysteria, when death and ruin are agreeable additions to the\r\nprospect. It gives the business a gravity, a solemnity. Timid people may\r\nhesitate and draw back with a vague instinctive terror of the immensity\r\nof the oppositions they challenge, but neither Isabel nor I are timid\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nWe weighed what was against us. We decided just exactly as scores of\r\nthousands of people have decided in this very matter, that if it were\r\npossible to keep this thing to ourselves, there was nothing against it.\r\nAnd so we took our first step. With the hunger of love in us, it was\r\neasy to conclude we might be lovers, and still keep everything to\r\nourselves. That cleared our minds of the one persistent obstacle that\r\nmattered to us--the haunting presence of Margaret.\r\n\r\nAnd then we found, as all those scores of thousands of people scattered\r\nabout us have found, that we could not keep it to ourselves. Love will\r\nout. All the rest of this story is the chronicle of that. Love with\r\nsustained secrecy cannot be love. It is just exactly the point people do\r\nnot understand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\nBut before things came to that pass, some months and many phases and a\r\nsudden journey to America intervened.\r\n\r\n“This thing spells disaster,” I said. “You are too big and I am too big\r\nto attempt this secrecy. Think of the intolerable possibility of being\r\nfound out! At any cost we have to stop--even at the cost of parting.”\r\n\r\n“Just because we may be found out!”\r\n\r\n“Just because we may be found out.”\r\n\r\n“Master, I shouldn't in the least mind being found out with you. I'm\r\nafraid--I'd be proud.”\r\n\r\n“Wait till it happens.”\r\n\r\nThere followed a struggle of immense insincerity between us. It is hard\r\nto tell who urged and who resisted.\r\n\r\nShe came to me one night to the editorial room of the BLUE WEEKLY, and\r\nargued and kissed me with wet salt lips, and wept in my arms; she told\r\nme that now passionate longing for me and my intimate life possessed\r\nher, so that she could not work, could not think, could not endure other\r\npeople for the love of me....\r\n\r\nI fled absurdly. That is the secret of the futile journey to America\r\nthat puzzled all my friends.\r\n\r\nI ran away from Isabel. I took hold of the situation with all my\r\nstrength, put in Britten with sketchy, hasty instructions to edit the\r\npaper, and started headlong and with luggage, from which, among other\r\nthings, my shaving things were omitted, upon a tour round the world.\r\n\r\nPreposterous flight that was! I remember as a thing almost farcical my\r\nexplanations to Margaret, and how frantically anxious I was to prevent\r\nthe remote possibility of her coming with me, and how I crossed in the\r\nTUSCAN, a bad, wet boat, and mixed seasickness with ungovernable sorrow.\r\nI wept--tears. It was inexpressibly queer and ridiculous--and, good God!\r\nhow I hated my fellow-passengers!\r\n\r\nNew York inflamed and excited me for a time, and when things slackened,\r\nI whirled westward to Chicago--eating and drinking, I remember, in the\r\ntrain from shoals of little dishes, with a sort of desperate voracity.\r\nI did the queerest things to distract myself--no novelist would dare to\r\ninvent my mental and emotional muddle. Chicago also held me at first,\r\namazing lapse from civilisation that the place is! and then abruptly,\r\nwith hosts expecting me, and everything settled for some days in Denver,\r\nI found myself at the end of my renunciations, and turned and came back\r\nheadlong to London.\r\n\r\nLet me confess it wasn't any sense of perfect and incurable trust and\r\nconfidence that brought me back, or any idea that now I had strength to\r\nrefrain. It was a sudden realisation that after all the separation might\r\nsucceed; some careless phrasing in one of her jealously read letters set\r\nthat idea going in my mind--the haunting perception that I might return\r\nto London and find it empty of the Isabel who had pervaded it. Honour,\r\ndiscretion, the careers of both of us, became nothing at the thought. I\r\ncouldn't conceive my life resuming there without Isabel. I couldn't, in\r\nshort, stand it.\r\n\r\nI don't even excuse my return. It is inexcusable. I ought to have kept\r\nupon my way westward--and held out. I couldn't. I wanted Isabel, and\r\nI wanted her so badly now that everything else in the world was\r\nphantom-like until that want was satisfied. Perhaps you have never\r\nwanted anything like that. I went straight to her.\r\n\r\nBut here I come to untellable things. There is no describing the reality\r\nof love. The shapes of things are nothing, the actual happenings are\r\nnothing, except that somehow there falls a light upon them and a wonder.\r\nOf how we met, and the thrill of the adventure, the curious bright sense\r\nof defiance, the joy of having dared, I can't tell--I can but hint of\r\njust one aspect, of what an amazing LARK--it's the only word--it seemed\r\nto us. The beauty which was the essence of it, which justifies it so far\r\nas it will bear justification, eludes statement.\r\n\r\nWhat can a record of contrived meetings, of sundering difficulties\r\nevaded and overcome, signify here? Or what can it convey to say that\r\none looked deep into two dear, steadfast eyes, or felt a heart throb\r\nand beat, or gripped soft hair softly in a trembling hand? Robbed of\r\nencompassing love, these things are of no more value than the taste of\r\ngood wine or the sight of good pictures, or the hearing of music,--just\r\nsensuality and no more. No one can tell love--we can only tell the gross\r\nfacts of love and its consequences. Given love--given mutuality, and one\r\nhas effected a supreme synthesis and come to a new level of life--but\r\nonly those who know can know. This business has brought me more\r\nbitterness and sorrow than I had ever expected to bear, but even now\r\nI will not say that I regret that wilful home-coming altogether. We\r\nloved--to the uttermost. Neither of us could have loved any one else\r\nas we did and do love one another. It was ours, that beauty; it existed\r\nonly between us when we were close together, for no one in the world\r\never to know save ourselves.\r\n\r\nMy return to the office sticks out in my memory with an extreme\r\nvividness, because of the wild eagle of pride that screamed within me.\r\nIt was Tuesday morning, and though not a soul in London knew of it yet\r\nexcept Isabel, I had been back in England a week. I came in upon Britten\r\nand stood in the doorway.\r\n\r\n“GOD!” he said at the sight of me.\r\n\r\n“I'm back,” I said.\r\n\r\nHe looked at my excited face with those red-brown eyes of his. Silently\r\nI defied him to speak his mind.\r\n\r\n“Where did you turn back?” he said at last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\r\nI had to tell what were, so far as I can remember my first positive lies\r\nto Margaret in explaining that return. I had written to her from Chicago\r\nand again from New York, saying that I felt I ought to be on the spot\r\nin England for the new session, and that I was coming back--presently.\r\nI concealed the name of my boat from her, and made a calculated\r\nprevarication when I announced my presence in London. I telephoned\r\nbefore I went back for my rooms to be prepared. She was, I knew, with\r\nthe Bunting Harblows in Durham, and when she came back to Radnor Square\r\nI had been at home a day.\r\n\r\nI remember her return so well.\r\n\r\nMy going away and the vivid secret of the present had wiped out from my\r\nmind much of our long estrangement. Something, too, had changed in her.\r\nI had had some hint of it in her letters, but now I saw it plainly. I\r\ncame out of my study upon the landing when I heard the turmoil of her\r\narrival below, and she came upstairs with a quickened gladness. It was a\r\ncold March, and she was dressed in unfamiliar dark furs that suited her\r\nextremely and reinforced the delicate flush of her sweet face. She held\r\nout both her hands to me, and drew me to her unhesitatingly and kissed\r\nme.\r\n\r\n“So glad you are back, dear,” she said. “Oh! so very glad you are back.”\r\n\r\nI returned her kiss with a queer feeling at my heart, too\r\nundifferentiated to be even a definite sense of guilt or meanness. I\r\nthink it was chiefly amazement--at the universe--at myself.\r\n\r\n“I never knew what it was to be away from you,” she said.\r\n\r\nI perceived suddenly that she had resolved to end our estrangement. She\r\nput herself so that my arm came caressingly about her.\r\n\r\n“These are jolly furs,” I said.\r\n\r\n“I got them for you.”\r\n\r\nThe parlourmaid appeared below dealing with the maid and the luggage\r\ncab.\r\n\r\n“Tell me all about America,” said Margaret. “I feel as though you'd been\r\naway six year's.”\r\n\r\nWe went arm in arm into our little sitting-room, and I took off the\r\nfur's for her and sat down upon the chintz-covered sofa by the fire.\r\nShe had ordered tea, and came and sat by me. I don't know what I had\r\nexpected, but of all things I had certainly not expected this sudden\r\nabolition of our distances.\r\n\r\n“I want to know all about America,” she repeated, with her eyes\r\nscrutinising me. “Why did you come back?”\r\n\r\nI repeated the substance of my letters rather lamely, and she sat\r\nlistening.\r\n\r\n“But why did you turn back--without going to Denver?”\r\n\r\n“I wanted to come back. I was restless.”\r\n\r\n“Restlessness,” she said, and thought. “You were restless in Venice. You\r\nsaid it was restlessness took you to America.”\r\n\r\nAgain she studied me. She turned a little awkwardly to her tea things,\r\nand poured needless water from the silver kettle into the teapot.\r\nThen she sat still for some moments looking at the equipage with\r\nexpressionless eyes. I saw her hand upon the edge of the table tremble\r\nslightly. I watched her closely. A vague uneasiness possessed me. What\r\nmight she not know or guess?\r\n\r\nShe spoke at last with an effort. “I wish you were in Parliament again,”\r\n she said. “Life doesn't give you events enough.”\r\n\r\n“If I was in Parliament again, I should be on the Conservative side.”\r\n\r\n“I know,” she said, and was still more thoughtful.\r\n\r\n“Lately,” she began, and paused. “Lately I've been reading--you.”\r\n\r\nI didn't help her out with what she had to say. I waited.\r\n\r\n“I didn't understand what you were after. I had misjudged. I didn't\r\nknow. I think perhaps I was rather stupid.” Her eyes were suddenly\r\nshining with tears. “You didn't give me much chance to understand.”\r\n\r\nShe turned upon me suddenly with a voice full of tears.\r\n\r\n“Husband,” she said abruptly, holding her two hands out to me, “I want\r\nto begin over again!”\r\n\r\nI took her hands, perplexed beyond measure. “My dear!” I said.\r\n\r\n“I want to begin over again.”\r\n\r\nI bowed my head to hide my face, and found her hand in mine and kissed\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” she said, and slowly withdrew her hand. She leant forward with her\r\narm on the sofa-back, and looked very intently into my face. I felt the\r\nmost damnable scoundrel in the world as I returned her gaze. The thought\r\nof Isabel's darkly shining eyes seemed like a physical presence between\r\nus....\r\n\r\n“Tell me,” I said presently, to break the intolerable tension, “tell me\r\nplainly what you mean by this.”\r\n\r\nI sat a little away from her, and then took my teacup in hand, with an\r\nodd effect of defending myself. “Have you been reading that old book of\r\nmine?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“That and the paper. I took a complete set from the beginning down\r\nto Durham with me. I have read it over, thought it over. I didn't\r\nunderstand--what you were teaching.”\r\n\r\nThere was a little pause.\r\n\r\n“It all seems so plain to me now,” she said, “and so true.”\r\n\r\nI was profoundly disconcerted. I put down my teacup, stood up in the\r\nmiddle of the hearthrug, and began talking. “I'm tremendously glad,\r\nMargaret, that you've come to see I'm not altogether perverse,” I began.\r\nI launched out into a rather trite and windy exposition of my views, and\r\nshe sat close to me on the sofa, looking up into my face, hanging on my\r\nwords, a deliberate and invincible convert.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said, “yes.”...\r\n\r\nI had never doubted my new conceptions before; now I doubted them\r\nprofoundly. But I went on talking. It's the grim irony in the lives of\r\nall politicians, writers, public teachers, that once the audience is at\r\ntheir feet, a new loyalty has gripped them. It isn't their business to\r\nadmit doubt and imperfections. They have to go on talking. And I was\r\nnow so accustomed to Isabel's vivid interruptions, qualifications,\r\nrestatements, and confirmations....\r\n\r\nMargaret and I dined together at home. She made me open out my political\r\nprojects to her. “I have been foolish,” she said. “I want to help.”\r\n\r\nAnd by some excuse I have forgotten she made me come to her room. I\r\nthink it was some book I had to take her, some American book I had\r\nbrought back with me, and mentioned in our talk. I walked in with it,\r\nand put it down on the table and turned to go.\r\n\r\n“Husband!” she cried, and held out her slender arms to me. I was\r\ncompelled to go to her and kiss her, and she twined them softly about my\r\nneck and drew me to her and kissed me. I disentangled them very gently,\r\nand took each wrist and kissed it, and the backs of her hands.\r\n\r\n“Good-night,” I said. There came a little pause. “Good-night, Margaret,”\r\n I repeated, and walked very deliberately and with a kind of sham\r\npreoccupation to the door.\r\n\r\nI did not look at her, but I could feel her standing, watching me. If I\r\nhad looked up, she would, I knew, have held out her arms to me....\r\n\r\nAt the very outset that secret, which was to touch no one but Isabel and\r\nmyself, had reached out to stab another human being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole world had changed for Isabel and me; and we tried to pretend\r\nthat nothing had changed except a small matter between us. We believed\r\nquite honestly at that time that it was possible to keep this thing\r\nthat had happened from any reaction at all, save perhaps through some\r\nmagically enhanced vigour in our work, upon the world about us! Seen in\r\nretrospect, one can realise the absurdity of this belief; within a week\r\nI realised it; but that does not alter the fact that we did believe as\r\nmuch, and that people who are deeply in love and unable to marry will\r\ncontinue to believe so to the very end of time. They will continue to\r\nbelieve out of existence every consideration that separates them until\r\nthey have come together. Then they will count the cost, as we two had to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nI am telling a story, and not propounding theories in this book; and\r\nchiefly I am telling of the ideas and influences and emotions that\r\nhave happened to me--me as a sort of sounding board for my world. The\r\nmoralist is at liberty to go over my conduct with his measure and\r\nsay, “At this point or at that you went wrong, and you ought to have\r\ndone”--so-and-so. The point of interest to the statesman is that it\r\ndidn't for a moment occur to us to do so-and-so when the time for doing\r\nit came. It amazes me now to think how little either of us troubled\r\nabout the established rights or wrongs of the situation. We hadn't an\r\natom of respect for them, innate or acquired. The guardians of public\r\nmorals will say we were very bad people; I submit in defence that they\r\nare very bad guardians--provocative guardians.... And when at last there\r\ncame a claim against us that had an effective validity for us, we were\r\nin the full tide of passionate intimacy.\r\n\r\nI had a night of nearly sleepless perplexity after Margaret's return.\r\nShe had suddenly presented herself to me like something dramatically\r\nrecalled, fine, generous, infinitely capable of feeling. I was amazed\r\nhow much I had forgotten her. In my contempt for vulgarised and\r\nconventionalised honour I had forgotten that for me there was such\r\na reality as honour. And here it was, warm and near to me, living,\r\nbreathing, unsuspecting. Margaret's pride was my honour, that I had had\r\nno right even to imperil.\r\n\r\nI do not now remember if I thought at that time of going to Isabel and\r\nputting this new aspect of the case before her. Perhaps I did. Perhaps\r\nI may have considered even then the possibility of ending what had so\r\nfreshly and passionately begun. If I did, it vanished next day at\r\nthe sight of her. Whatever regrets came in the darkness, the daylight\r\nbrought an obstinate confidence in our resolution again. We would, we\r\ndeclared, “pull the thing off.” Margaret must not know. Margaret should\r\nnot know. If Margaret did not know, then no harm whatever would be done.\r\nWe tried to sustain that....\r\n\r\nFor a brief time we had been like two people in a magic cell, magically\r\ncut off from the world and full of a light of its own, and then we began\r\nto realise that we were not in the least cut off, that the world was all\r\nabout us and pressing in upon us, limiting us, threatening us, resuming\r\npossession of us. I tried to ignore the injury to Margaret of her\r\nunreciprocated advances. I tried to maintain to myself that this hidden\r\nlove made no difference to the now irreparable breach between husband\r\nand wife. But I never spoke of it to Isabel or let her see that aspect\r\nof our case. How could I? The time for that had gone....\r\n\r\nThen in new shapes and relations came trouble. Distressful elements\r\ncrept in by reason of our unavoidable furtiveness; we ignored them,\r\nhid them from each other, and attempted to hide them from ourselves.\r\nSuccessful love is a thing of abounding pride, and we had to be secret.\r\nIt was delightful at first to be secret, a whispering, warm conspiracy;\r\nthen presently it became irksome and a little shameful. Her essential\r\nfrankness of soul was all against the masks and falsehoods that many\r\nwomen would have enjoyed. Together in our secrecy we relaxed, then in\r\nthe presence of other people again it was tiresome to have to watch\r\nfor the careless, too easy phrase, to snatch back one's hand from the\r\nlimitless betrayal of a light, familiar touch.\r\n\r\nLove becomes a poor thing, at best a poor beautiful thing, if it\r\ndevelops no continuing and habitual intimacy. We were always meeting,\r\nand most gloriously loving and beginning--and then we had to snatch at\r\nremorseless ticking watches, hurry to catch trains, and go back to this\r\nor that. That is all very well for the intrigues of idle people perhaps,\r\nbut not for an intense personal relationship. It is like lighting a\r\ncandle for the sake of lighting it, over and over again, and each time\r\nblowing it out. That, no doubt, must be very amusing to children playing\r\nwith the matches, but not to people who love warm light, and want it in\r\norder to do fine and honourable things together. We had achieved--I\r\ngive the ugly phrase that expresses the increasing discolouration in my\r\nmind--“illicit intercourse.” To end at that, we now perceived, wasn't in\r\nour style. But where were we to end?...\r\n\r\nPerhaps we might at this stage have given it up. I think if we could\r\nhave seen ahead and around us we might have done so. But the glow of our\r\ncell blinded us.... I wonder what might have happened if at that time we\r\nhad given it up.... We propounded it, we met again in secret to discuss\r\nit, and our overpowering passion for one another reduced that meeting to\r\nabsurdity....\r\n\r\nPresently the idea of children crept between us. It came in from all our\r\nconceptions of life and public service; it was, we found, in the quality\r\nof our minds that physical love without children is a little weak,\r\ntimorous, more than a little shameful. With imaginative people there\r\nvery speedily comes a time when that realisation is inevitable. We\r\nhadn't thought of that before--it isn't natural to think of that before.\r\nWe hadn't known. There is no literature in English dealing with such\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nThere is a necessary sequence of phases in love. These came in their\r\norder, and with them, unanticipated tarnishings on the first bright\r\nperfection of our relations. For a time these developing phases were\r\nno more than a secret and private trouble between us, little shadows\r\nspreading by imperceptible degrees across that vivid and luminous cell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Handitch election flung me suddenly into prominence.\r\n\r\nIt is still only two years since that struggle, and I will not trouble\r\nthe reader with a detailed history of events that must be quite\r\nsufficiently present in his mind for my purpose already. Huge stacks of\r\njournalism have dealt with Handitch and its significance. For the reader\r\nvery probably, as for most people outside a comparatively small circle,\r\nit meant my emergence from obscurity. We obtruded no editor's name in\r\nthe BLUE WEEKLY; I had never as yet been on the London hoardings. Before\r\nHanditch I was a journalist and writer of no great public standing;\r\nafter Handitch, I was definitely a person, in the little group of\r\npersons who stood for the Young Imperialist movement. Handitch was, to a\r\nvery large extent, my affair. I realised then, as a man comes to do, how\r\nmuch one can still grow after seven and twenty. In the second election\r\nI was a man taking hold of things; at Kinghamstead I had been simply a\r\nyoung candidate, a party unit, led about the constituency, told to\r\ndo this and that, and finally washed in by the great Anti-Imperialist\r\nflood, like a starfish rolling up a beach.\r\n\r\nMy feminist views had earnt the mistrust of the party, and I do not\r\nthink I should have got the chance of Handitch or indeed any chance at\r\nall of Parliament for a long time, if it had not been that the seat with\r\nits long record of Liberal victories and its Liberal majority of 3642 at\r\nthe last election, offered a hopeless contest. The Liberal dissensions\r\nand the belated but by no means contemptible Socialist candidate were\r\nprovidential interpositions. I think, however, the conduct of Gane,\r\nCrupp, and Tarvrille in coming down to fight for me, did count\r\ntremendously in my favour. “We aren't going to win, perhaps,” said\r\nCrupp, “but we are going to talk.” And until the very eve of victory, we\r\ntreated Handitch not so much as a battlefield as a hoarding. And so it\r\nwas the Endowment of Motherhood as a practical form of Eugenics got into\r\nEnglish politics.\r\n\r\nPlutus, our agent, was scared out of his wits when the thing began.\r\n\r\n“They're ascribing all sorts of queer ideas to you about the Family,” he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“I think the Family exists for the good of the children,” I said; “is\r\nthat queer?”\r\n\r\n“Not when you explain it--but they won't let you explain it. And about\r\nmarriage--?”\r\n\r\n“I'm all right about marriage--trust me.”\r\n\r\n“Of course, if YOU had children,” said Plutus, rather\r\ninconsiderately....\r\n\r\nThey opened fire upon me in a little electioneering rag call\r\nthe HANDITCH SENTINEL, with a string of garbled quotations and\r\nmisrepresentations that gave me an admirable text for a speech. I spoke\r\nfor an hour and ten minutes with a more and more crumpled copy of the\r\nSENTINEL in my hand, and I made the fullest and completest exposition\r\nof the idea of endowing motherhood that I think had ever been made up\r\nto that time in England. Its effect on the press was extraordinary. The\r\nLiberal papers gave me quite unprecedented space under the impression\r\nthat I had only to be given rope to hang myself; the Conservatives cut\r\nme down or tried to justify me; the whole country was talking. I had had\r\na pamphlet in type upon the subject, and I revised this carefully and\r\nput it on the book-stalls within three days. It sold enormously and\r\nbrought me bushels of letters. We issued over three thousand in Handitch\r\nalone. At meeting after meeting I was heckled upon nothing else. Long\r\nbefore polling day Plutus was converted.\r\n\r\n“It's catching on like old age pensions,” he said. “We've dished the\r\nLiberals! To think that such a project should come from our side!”\r\n\r\nBut it was only with the declaration of the poll that my battle was won.\r\nNo one expected more than a snatch victory, and I was in by over fifteen\r\nhundred. At one bound Cossington's papers passed from apologetics varied\r\nby repudiation to triumphant praise. “A renascent England, breeding\r\nmen,” said the leader in his chief daily on the morning after the\r\npolling, and claimed that the Conservatives had been ever the pioneers\r\nin sanely bold constructive projects.\r\n\r\nI came up to London with a weary but rejoicing Margaret by the night\r\ntrain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE SECOND ~~ THE IMPOSSIBLE POSITION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nTo any one who did not know of that glowing secret between Isabel and\r\nmyself, I might well have appeared at that time the most successful and\r\nenviable of men. I had recovered rapidly from an uncongenial start\r\nin political life; I had become a considerable force through the BLUE\r\nWEEKLY, and was shaping an increasingly influential body of opinion; I\r\nhad re-entered Parliament with quite dramatic distinction, and in spite\r\nof a certain faltering on the part of the orthodox Conservatives\r\ntowards the bolder elements in our propaganda, I had loyal and unenvious\r\nassociates who were making me a power in the party. People were coming\r\nto our group, understandings were developing. It was clear we should\r\nplay a prominent part in the next general election, and that, given a\r\nConservative victory, I should be assured of office. The world opened\r\nout to me brightly and invitingly. Great schemes took shape in my mind,\r\nalways more concrete, always more practicable; the years ahead seemed\r\nfalling into order, shining with the credible promise of immense\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\nAnd at the heart of it all, unseen and unsuspected, was the secret of my\r\nrelations with Isabel--like a seed that germinates and thrusts, thrusts\r\nrelentlessly.\r\n\r\nFrom the onset of the Handitch contest onward, my meetings with her had\r\nbeen more and more pervaded by the discussion of our situation. It had\r\ninnumerable aspects. It was very present to us that we wanted to be\r\ntogether as much as possible--we were beginning to long very much for\r\nactual living together in the same house, so that one could come as\r\nit were carelessly--unawares--upon the other, busy perhaps about some\r\ntrivial thing. We wanted to feel each other in the daily atmosphere.\r\nPreceding our imperatively sterile passion, you must remember, outside\r\nit, altogether greater than it so far as our individual lives were\r\nconcerned, there had grown and still grew an enormous affection and\r\nintellectual sympathy between us. We brought all our impressions and all\r\nour ideas to each other, to see them in each other's light. It is hard\r\nto convey that quality of intellectual unison to any one who has not\r\nexperienced it. I thought more and more in terms of conversation with\r\nIsabel; her possible comments upon things would flash into my mind,\r\noh!--with the very sound of her voice.\r\n\r\nI remember, too, the odd effect of seeing her in the distance going\r\nabout Handitch, like any stranger canvasser; the queer emotion of her\r\napproach along the street, the greeting as she passed. The morning of\r\nthe polling she vanished from the constituency. I saw her for an instant\r\nin the passage behind our Committee rooms.\r\n\r\n“Going?” said I.\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n“Stay it out. I want you to see the fun. I remember--the other time.”\r\n\r\nShe didn't answer for a moment or so, and stood with face averted.\r\n\r\n“It's Margaret's show,” she said abruptly. “If I see her smiling there\r\nlike a queen by your side--! She did--last time. I remember.” She caught\r\nat a sob and dashed her hand across her face impatiently. “Jealous fool,\r\nmean and petty, jealous fool!... Good luck, old man, to you! You're\r\ngoing to win. But I don't want to see the end of it all the same....”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye!” said I, clasping her hand as some supporter appeared in the\r\npassage....\r\n\r\nI came back to London victorious, and a little flushed and coarse with\r\nvictory; and so soon as I could break away I went to Isabel's flat and\r\nfound her white and worn, with the stain of secret weeping about her\r\neyes. I came into the room to her and shut the door.\r\n\r\n“You said I'd win,” I said, and held out my arms.\r\n\r\nShe hugged me closely for a moment.\r\n\r\n“My dear,” I whispered, “it's nothing--without you--nothing!”\r\n\r\nWe didn't speak for some seconds. Then she slipped from my hold. “Look!”\r\n she said, smiling like winter sunshine. “I've had in all the morning\r\npapers--the pile of them, and you--resounding.”\r\n\r\n“It's more than I dared hope.”\r\n\r\n“Or I.”\r\n\r\nShe stood for a moment still smiling bravely, and then she was sobbing\r\nin my arms. “The bigger you are--the more you show,” she said--“the more\r\nwe are parted. I know, I know--”\r\n\r\nI held her close to me, making no answer.\r\n\r\nPresently she became still. “Oh, well,” she said, and wiped her eyes and\r\nsat down on the little sofa by the fire; and I sat down beside her.\r\n\r\n“I didn't know all there was in love,” she said, staring at the coals,\r\n“when we went love-making.”\r\n\r\nI put my arm behind her and took a handful of her dear soft hair in my\r\nhand and kissed it.\r\n\r\n“You've done a great thing this time,” she said. “Handitch will make\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“It opens big chances,” I said. “But why are you weeping, dear one?”\r\n\r\n“Envy,” she said, “and love.”\r\n\r\n“You're not lonely?”\r\n\r\n“I've plenty to do--and lots of people.”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“I want you.”\r\n\r\n“You've got me.”\r\n\r\nShe put her arm about me and kissed me. “I want you,” she said, “just as\r\nif I had nothing of you. You don't understand--how a woman wants a man.\r\nI thought once if I just gave myself to you it would be enough. It was\r\nnothing--it was just a step across the threshold. My dear, every moment\r\nyou are away I ache for you--ache! I want to be about when it isn't\r\nlove-making or talk. I want to be doing things for you, and watching\r\nyou when you're not thinking of me. All those safe, careless, intimate\r\nthings. And something else--” She stopped. “Dear, I don't want to bother\r\nyou. I just want you to know I love you....”\r\n\r\nShe caught my head in her hands and kissed it, then stood up abruptly.\r\n\r\nI looked up at her, a little perplexed.\r\n\r\n“Dear heart,” said I, “isn't this enough? You're my councillor, my\r\ncolleague, my right hand, the secret soul of my life--”\r\n\r\n“And I want to darn your socks,” she said, smiling back at me.\r\n\r\n“You're insatiable.”\r\n\r\nShe smiled “No,” she said. “I'm not insatiable, Master. But I'm a woman\r\nin love. And I'm finding out what I want, and what is necessary to\r\nme--and what I can't have. That's all.”\r\n\r\n“We get a lot.”\r\n\r\n“We want a lot. You and I are greedy people for the things we like,\r\nMaster. It's very evident we've got nearly all we can ever have of one\r\nanother--and I'm not satisfied.”\r\n\r\n“What more is there?\r\n\r\n“For you--very little. I wonder. For me--every thing. Yes--everything.\r\nYou didn't mean it, Master; you didn't know any more than I did when I\r\nbegan, but love between a man and a woman is sometimes very one-sided.\r\nFearfully one-sided! That's all....”\r\n\r\n“Don't YOU ever want children?” she said abruptly.\r\n\r\n“I suppose I do.”\r\n\r\n“You don't!”\r\n\r\n“I haven't thought of them.”\r\n\r\n“A man doesn't, perhaps. But I have.... I want them--like hunger.\r\nYOUR children, and home with you. Really, continually you! That's the\r\ntrouble.... I can't have 'em, Master, and I can't have you.”\r\n\r\nShe was crying, and through her tears she laughed.\r\n\r\n“I'm going to make a scene,” she said, “and get this over. I'm so\r\ndiscontented and miserable; I've got to tell you. It would come between\r\nus if I didn't. I'm in love with you, with everything--with all my\r\nbrains. I'll pull through all right. I'll be good, Master, never you\r\nfear. But to-day I'm crying out with all my being. This election--You're\r\ngoing up; you're going on. In these papers--you're a great big fact.\r\nIt's suddenly come home to me. At the back of my mind I've always had\r\nthe idea I was going to have you somehow presently for myself--I mean to\r\nhave you to go long tramps with, to keep house for, to get meals for,\r\nto watch for of an evening. It's a sort of habitual background to my\r\nthought of you. And it's nonsense--utter nonsense!” She stopped. She was\r\ncrying and choking. “And the child, you know--the child!”\r\n\r\nI was troubled beyond measure, but Handitch and its intimations were\r\nclear and strong.\r\n\r\n“We can't have that,” I said.\r\n\r\n“No,” she said, “we can't have that.”\r\n\r\n“We've got our own things to do.”\r\n\r\n“YOUR things,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Aren't they yours too?”\r\n\r\n“Because of you,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Aren't they your very own things?”\r\n\r\n“Women don't have that sort of very own thing. Indeed, it's true!\r\nAnd think! You've been down there preaching the goodness of children,\r\ntelling them the only good thing in a state is happy, hopeful children,\r\nworking to free mothers and children--”\r\n\r\n“And we give our own children to do it?” I said.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said. “And sometimes I think it's too much to give--too much\r\naltogether.... Children get into a woman's brain--when she mustn't have\r\nthem, especially when she must never hope for them. Think of the child\r\nwe might have now!--the little creature with soft, tender skin, and\r\nlittle hands and little feet! At times it haunts me. It comes and says,\r\nWhy wasn't I given life? I can hear it in the night.... The world is\r\nfull of such little ghosts, dear lover--little things that asked for\r\nlife and were refused. They clamour to me. It's like a little fist\r\nbeating at my heart. Love children, beautiful children. Little cold\r\nhands that tear at my heart! Oh, my heart and my lord!” She was holding\r\nmy arm with both her hands and weeping against it, and now she drew\r\nherself to my shoulder and wept and sobbed in my embrace. “I shall never\r\nsit with your child on my knee and you beside me-never, and I am a woman\r\nand your lover!...”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the profound impossibility of our relation was now becoming more and\r\nmore apparent to us. We found ourselves seeking justification, clinging\r\npassionately to a situation that was coldly, pitilessly, impossible and\r\nfated. We wanted quite intensely to live together and have a child, but\r\nalso we wanted very many other things that were incompatible with these\r\ndesires. It was extraordinarily difficult to weigh our political and\r\nintellectual ambitions against those intimate wishes. The weights kept\r\naltering according as one found oneself grasping this valued thing or\r\nthat. It wasn't as if we could throw everything aside for our love,\r\nand have that as we wanted it. Love such as we bore one another isn't\r\naltogether, or even chiefly, a thing in itself--it is for the most part\r\na value set upon things. Our love was interwoven with all our other\r\ninterests; to go out of the world and live in isolation seemed to us\r\nlike killing the best parts of each other; we loved the sight of each\r\nother engaged finely and characteristically, we knew each other best\r\nas activities. We had no delusions about material facts; we didn't want\r\neach other alive or dead, we wanted each other fully alive. We wanted\r\nto do big things together, and for us to take each other openly and\r\ndesperately would leave us nothing in the world to do. We wanted\r\nchildren indeed passionately, but children with every helpful chance in\r\nthe world, and children born in scandal would be handicapped at every\r\nturn. We wanted to share a home, and not a solitude.\r\n\r\nAnd when we were at this stage of realisation, began the intimations\r\nthat we were found out, and that scandal was afoot against us....\r\n\r\nI heard of it first from Esmeer, who deliberately mentioned it,\r\nwith that steady grey eye of his watching me, as an instance of the\r\npreposterous falsehoods people will circulate. It came to Isabel\r\nalmost simultaneously through a married college friend, who made it her\r\nbusiness to demand either confirmation or denial. It filled us both with\r\nconsternation. In the surprise of the moment Isabel admitted her secret,\r\nand her friend went off “reserving her freedom of action.”\r\n\r\nDiscovery broke out in every direction. Friends with grave faces and\r\nan atmosphere of infinite tact invaded us both. Other friends ceased to\r\ninvade either of us. It was manifest we had become--we knew not how--a\r\nprivate scandal, a subject for duologues, an amazement, a perplexity,\r\na vivid interest. In a few brief weeks it seemed London passed from\r\nabsolute unsuspiciousness to a chattering exaggeration of its knowledge\r\nof our relations.\r\n\r\nIt was just the most inappropriate time for that disclosure. The long\r\nsmouldering antagonism to my endowment of motherhood ideas had flared\r\nup into an active campaign in the EXPURGATOR, and it would be altogether\r\ndisastrous to us if I should be convicted of any personal irregularity.\r\nIt was just because of the manifest and challenging respectability of my\r\nposition that I had been able to carry the thing as far as I had done.\r\nNow suddenly my fortunes had sprung a leak, and scandal was pouring\r\nin.... It chanced, too, that a wave of moral intolerance was sweeping\r\nthrough London, one of those waves in which the bitterness of the\r\nconsciously just finds an ally in the panic of the undiscovered. A\r\ncertain Father Blodgett had been preaching against social corruption\r\nwith extraordinary force, and had roused the Church of England people\r\nto a kind of competition in denunciation. The old methods of the\r\nAnti-Socialist campaign had been renewed, and had offered far too wide\r\na scope and too tempting an opportunity for private animosity, to be\r\nrestricted to the private affairs of the Socialists. I had intimations\r\nof an extensive circulation of “private and confidential” letters....\r\n\r\nI think there can be nothing else in life quite like the unnerving\r\nrealisation that rumour and scandal are afoot about one. Abruptly\r\none's confidence in the solidity of the universe disappears. One\r\nwalks silenced through a world that one feels to be full of inaudible\r\naccusations. One cannot challenge the assault, get it out into the open,\r\nseparate truth and falsehood. It slinks from you, turns aside its face.\r\nOld acquaintances suddenly evaded me, made extraordinary excuses;\r\nmen who had presumed on the verge of my world and pestered me with an\r\nintrusive enterprise, now took the bold step of flat repudiation. I\r\nbecame doubtful about the return of a nod, retracted all those tentacles\r\nof easy civility that I had hitherto spread to the world. I still grow\r\nwarm with amazed indignation when I recall that Edward Crampton, meeting\r\nme full on the steps of the Climax Club, cut me dead. “By God!” I cried,\r\nand came near catching him by the throat and wringing out of him what\r\nof all good deeds and bad, could hearten him, a younger man than I and\r\nempty beyond comparison, to dare to play the judge to me. And then I had\r\nan open slight from Mrs. Millingham, whom I had counted on as one counts\r\nupon the sunrise. I had not expected things of that sort; they were\r\ndisconcerting beyond measure; it was as if the world were giving way\r\nbeneath my feet, as though something failed in the essential confidence\r\nof life, as though a hand of wet ice had touched my heart. Similar\r\nthings were happening to Isabel. Yet we went on working, visiting,\r\nmeeting, trying to ignore this gathering of implacable forces against\r\nus.\r\n\r\nFor a time I was perplexed beyond measure to account for this campaign.\r\nThen I got a clue. The centre of diffusion was the Bailey household. The\r\nBaileys had never forgiven me my abandonment of the young Liberal group\r\nthey had done so much to inspire and organise; their dinner-table had\r\nlong been a scene of hostile depreciation of the BLUE WEEKLY and all its\r\nallies; week after week Altiora proclaimed that I was “doing nothing,”\r\n and found other causes for our bye-election triumphs; I counted Chambers\r\nStreet a dangerous place for me. Yet, nevertheless, I was astonished to\r\nfind them using a private scandal against me. They did. I think Handitch\r\nhad filled up the measure of their bitterness, for I had not only\r\nabandoned them, but I was succeeding beyond even their power of\r\nmisrepresentation. Always I had been a wasp in their spider's web,\r\ndifficult to claim as a tool, uncritical, antagonistic. I admired their\r\nwork and devotion enormously, but I had never concealed my contempt for\r\na certain childish vanity they displayed, and for the frequent puerility\r\nof their political intrigues. I suppose contempt galls more than\r\ninjuries, and anyhow they had me now. They had me. Bailey, I found,\r\nwas warning fathers of girls against me as a “reckless libertine,” and\r\nAltiora, flushed, roguish, and dishevelled, was sitting on her fender\r\ncurb after dinner, and pledging little parties of five or six women at a\r\ntime with infinite gusto not to let the matter go further. Our cell was\r\nopen to the world, and a bleak, distressful daylight streaming in.\r\n\r\nI had a gleam of a more intimate motive in Altiora from the reports that\r\ncame to me. Isabel had been doing a series of five or six articles in\r\nthe POLITICAL REVIEW in support of our campaign, the POLITICAL REVIEW\r\nwhich had hitherto been loyally Baileyite. Quite her best writing up to\r\nthe present, at any rate, is in those papers, and no doubt Altiora had\r\nhad not only to read her in those invaded columns, but listen to her\r\npraises in the mouths of the tactless influential. Altiora, like so many\r\npeople who rely on gesture and vocal insistence in conversation, writes\r\na poor and slovenly prose and handles an argument badly; Isabel has her\r\nUniversity training behind her and wrote from the first with the stark\r\npower of a clear-headed man. “Now we know,” said Altiora, with just a\r\ngleam of malice showing through her brightness, “now we know who helps\r\nwith the writing!”\r\n\r\nShe revealed astonishing knowledge.\r\n\r\nFor a time I couldn't for the life of me discover her sources. I had,\r\nindeed, a desperate intention of challenging her, and then I bethought\r\nme of a youngster named Curmain, who had been my supplemental typist and\r\nsecretary for a time, and whom I had sent on to her before the days of\r\nour breach. “Of course!” said I, “Curmain!” He was a tall, drooping,\r\nsidelong youth with sandy hair, a little forward head, and a long\r\nthin neck. He stole stamps, and, I suspected, rifled my private letter\r\ndrawer, and I found him one day on a turn of the stairs looking guilty\r\nand ruffled with a pretty Irish housemaid of Margaret's manifestly in\r\na state of hot indignation. I saw nothing, but I felt everything in the\r\nair between them. I hate this pestering of servants, but at the same\r\ntime I didn't want Curmain wiped out of existence, so I had packed him\r\noff without unnecessary discussion to Altiora. He was quick and cheap\r\nanyhow, and I thought her general austerity ought to redeem him if\r\nanything could; the Chambers Street housemaid wasn't for any man's\r\nkissing and showed it, and the stamps and private letters were looked\r\nafter with an efficiency altogether surpassing mine. And Altiora, I've\r\nno doubt left now whatever, pumped this young undesirable about me,\r\nand scenting a story, had him to dinner alone one evening to get to the\r\nbottom of the matter. She got quite to the bottom of it,--it must have\r\nbeen a queer duologue. She read Isabel's careless, intimate letters\r\nto me, so to speak, by this proxy, and she wasn't ashamed to use this\r\ninformation in the service of the bitterness that had sprung up in her\r\nsince our political breach. It was essentially a personal bitterness; it\r\nhelped no public purpose of theirs to get rid of me. My downfall in\r\nany public sense was sheer waste,--the loss of a man. She knew she was\r\nbehaving badly, and so, when it came to remonstrance, she behaved worse.\r\nShe'd got names and dates and places; the efficiency of her information\r\nwas irresistible. And she set to work at it marvellously. Never before,\r\nin all her pursuit of efficient ideals, had Altiora achieved such levels\r\nof efficiency. I wrote a protest that was perhaps ill-advised and angry,\r\nI went to her and tried to stop her. She wouldn't listen, she wouldn't\r\nthink, she denied and lied, she behaved like a naughty child of six\r\nyears old which has made up its mind to be hurtful. It wasn't only, I\r\nthink, that she couldn't bear our political and social influence; she\r\nalso--I realised at that interview couldn't bear our loving. It seemed\r\nto her the sickliest thing,--a thing quite unendurable. While such\r\nthings were, the virtue had gone out of her world.\r\n\r\nI've the vividest memory of that call of mine. She'd just come in and\r\ntaken off her hat, and she was grey and dishevelled and tired, and in\r\na business-like dress of black and crimson that didn't suit her and\r\nwas muddy about the skirts; she'd a cold in her head and sniffed\r\npenetratingly, she avoided my eye as she talked and interrupted\r\neverything I had to say; she kept stabbing fiercely at the cushions of\r\nher sofa with a long hat-pin and pretending she was overwhelmed with\r\ngrief at the DEBACLE she was deliberately organising.\r\n\r\n“Then part,” she cried, “part. If you don't want a smashing up,--part!\r\nYou two have got to be parted. You've got never to see each other ever,\r\nnever to speak.” There was a zest in her voice. “We're not circulating\r\nstories,” she denied. “No! And Curmain never told us anything--Curmain\r\nis an EXCELLENT young man; oh! a quite excellent young man. You\r\nmisjudged him altogether.”...\r\n\r\nI was equally unsuccessful with Bailey. I caught the little wretch in\r\nthe League Club, and he wriggled and lied. He wouldn't say where he had\r\ngot his facts, he wouldn't admit he had told any one. When I gave him\r\nthe names of two men who had come to me astonished and incredulous,\r\nhe attempted absurdly to make me think they had told HIM. He did his\r\nhorrible little best to suggest that honest old Quackett, who had just\r\nleft England for the Cape, was the real scandalmonger. That struck me\r\nas mean, even for Bailey. I've still the odd vivid impression of his\r\nfluting voice, excusing the inexcusable, his big, shifty face evading\r\nme, his perspiration-beaded forehead, the shrugging shoulders, and the\r\nwould-be exculpatory gestures--Houndsditch gestures--of his enormous\r\nugly hands.\r\n\r\n“I can assure you, my dear fellow,” he said; “I can assure you we've\r\ndone everything to shield you--everything.”...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nIsabel came after dinner one evening and talked in the office. She made\r\na white-robed, dusky figure against the deep blues of my big window. I\r\nsat at my desk and tore a quill pen to pieces as I talked.\r\n\r\n“The Baileys don't intend to let this drop,” I said. “They mean that\r\nevery one in London is to know about it.”\r\n\r\n“I know.”\r\n\r\n“Well!” I said.\r\n\r\n“Dear heart,” said Isabel, facing it, “it's no good waiting for things\r\nto overtake us; we're at the parting of the ways.”\r\n\r\n“What are we to do?”\r\n\r\n“They won't let us go on.”\r\n\r\n“Damn them!”\r\n\r\n“They are ORGANISING scandal.”\r\n\r\n“It's no good waiting for things to overtake us,” I echoed; “they have\r\novertaken us.” I turned on her. “What do you want to do?”\r\n\r\n“Everything,” she said. “Keep you and have our work. Aren't we Mates?”\r\n\r\n“We can't.”\r\n\r\n“And we can't!”\r\n\r\n“I've got to tell Margaret,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Margaret!”\r\n\r\n“I can't bear the idea of any one else getting in front with it. I've\r\nbeen wincing about Margaret secretly--”\r\n\r\n“I know. You'll have to tell her--and make your peace with her.”\r\n\r\nShe leant back against the bookcases under the window.\r\n\r\n“We've had some good times, Master;” she said, with a sigh in her voice.\r\n\r\nAnd then for a long time we stared at one another in silence.\r\n\r\n“We haven't much time left,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Shall we bolt?” I said.\r\n\r\n“And leave all this?” she asked, with her eyes going round the room.\r\n“And that?” And her head indicated Westminster. “No!”\r\n\r\nI said no more of bolting.\r\n\r\n“We've got to screw ourselves up to surrender,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Something.”\r\n\r\n“A lot.”\r\n\r\n“Master,” she said, “it isn't all sex and stuff between us?”\r\n\r\n“No!”\r\n\r\n“I can't give up the work. Our work's my life.”\r\n\r\nWe came upon another long pause.\r\n\r\n“No one will believe we've ceased to be lovers--if we simply do,” she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“We shouldn't.”\r\n\r\n“We've got to do something more parting than that.”\r\n\r\nI nodded, and again we paused. She was coming to something.\r\n\r\n“I could marry Shoesmith,” she said abruptly.\r\n\r\n“But--” I objected.\r\n\r\n“He knows. It wasn't fair. I told him.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that explains,” I said. “There's been a kind of sulkiness--But--you\r\ntold him?”\r\n\r\nShe nodded. “He's rather badly hurt,” she said. “He's been a good\r\nfriend to me. He's curiously loyal. But something, something he said one\r\nday--forced me to let him know.... That's been the beastliness of all\r\nthis secrecy. That's the beastliness of all secrecy. You have to spring\r\nsurprises on people. But he keeps on. He's steadfast. He'd already\r\nsuspected. He wants me very badly to marry him....”\r\n\r\n“But you don't want to marry him?”\r\n\r\n“I'm forced to think of it.”\r\n\r\n“But does he want to marry you at that? Take you as a present from the\r\nworld at large?--against your will and desire?... I don't understand\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“He cares for me.”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“He thinks this is a fearful mess for me. He wants to pull it straight.”\r\n\r\nWe sat for a time in silence, with imaginations that obstinately refused\r\nto take up the realities of this proposition.\r\n\r\n“I don't want you to marry Shoesmith,” I said at last.\r\n\r\n“Don't you like him?”\r\n\r\n“Not as your husband.”\r\n\r\n“He's a very clever and sturdy person--and very generous and devoted to\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“And me?”\r\n\r\n“You can't expect that. He thinks you are wonderful--and, naturally,\r\nthat you ought not to have started this.”\r\n\r\n“I've a curious dislike to any one thinking that but myself. I'm quite\r\nready to think it myself.”\r\n\r\n“He'd let us be friends--and meet.”\r\n\r\n“Let us be friends!” I cried, after a long pause. “You and me!”\r\n\r\n“He wants me to be engaged soon. Then, he says, he can go round fighting\r\nthese rumours, defending us both--and force a quarrel on the Baileys.”\r\n\r\n“I don't understand him,” I said, and added, “I don't understand you.”\r\n\r\nI was staring at her face. It seemed white and set in the dimness.\r\n\r\n“Do you really mean this, Isabel?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“What else is there to do, my dear?--what else is there to do at all?\r\nI've been thinking day and night. You can't go away with me. You can't\r\nsmash yourself suddenly in the sight of all men. I'd rather die than\r\nthat should happen. Look what you are becoming in the country! Look at\r\nall you've built up!--me helping. I wouldn't let you do it if you could.\r\nI wouldn't let you--if it were only for Margaret's sake. THIS... closes\r\nthe scandal, closes everything.”\r\n\r\n“It closes all our life together,” I cried.\r\n\r\nShe was silent.\r\n\r\n“It never ought to have begun,” I said.\r\n\r\nShe winced. Then abruptly she was on her knees before me, with her hands\r\nupon my shoulder and her eyes meeting mine.\r\n\r\n“My dear,” she said very earnestly, “don't misunderstand me! Don't think\r\nI'm retreating from the things we've done! Our love is the best thing I\r\ncould ever have had from life. Nothing can ever equal it; nothing could\r\never equal the beauty and delight you and I have had together. Never!\r\nYou have loved me; you do love me....”\r\n\r\nNo one could ever know how to love you as I have loved you; no one could\r\never love me as you have loved me, my king. And it's just because it's\r\nbeen so splendid, dear; it's just because I'd die rather than have a\r\ntithe of all this wiped out of my life again--for it's made me, it's all\r\nI am--dear, it's years since I began loving you--it's just because of\r\nits goodness that I want not to end in wreckage now, not to end in\r\nthe smashing up of all the big things I understand in you and love in\r\nyou....\r\n\r\n“What is there for us if we keep on and go away?” she went on. “All\r\nthe big interests in our lives will vanish--everything. We shall become\r\nspecialised people--people overshadowed by a situation. We shall be\r\nan elopement, a romance--all our breadth and meaning gone! People will\r\nalways think of it first when they think of us; all our work and aims\r\nwill be warped by it and subordinated to it. Is it good enough, dear?\r\nJust to specialise.... I think of you. We've got a case, a passionate\r\ncase, the best of cases, but do we want to spend all our lives defending\r\nit and justifying it? And there's that other life. I know now you care\r\nfor Margaret--you care more than you think you do. You have said fine\r\nthings of her. I've watched you about her. Little things have dropped\r\nfrom you. She's given her life for you; she's nothing without you.\r\nYou feel that to your marrow all the time you are thinking about these\r\nthings. Oh, I'm not jealous, dear. I love you for loving her. I love you\r\nin relation to her. But there it is, an added weight against us, another\r\nthing worth saving.”\r\n\r\nPresently, I remember, she sat back on her heels and looked up into\r\nmy face. “We've done wrong--and parting's paying. It's time to pay.\r\nWe needn't have paid, if we'd kept to the track.... You and I, Master,\r\nwe've got to be men.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said; “we've got to be men.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\nI was driven to tell Margaret about our situation by my intolerable\r\ndread that otherwise the thing might come to her through some stupid and\r\nclumsy informant. She might even meet Altiora, and have it from her.\r\n\r\nI can still recall the feeling of sitting at my desk that night in that\r\nlarge study of mine in Radnor Square, waiting for Margaret to come home.\r\nIt was oddly like the feeling of a dentist's reception-room; only it was\r\nfor me to do the dentistry with clumsy, cruel hands. I had left the door\r\nopen so that she would come in to me.\r\n\r\nI heard her silken rustle on the stairs at last, and then she was in the\r\ndoorway. “May I come in?” she said.\r\n\r\n“Do,” I said, and turned round to her.\r\n\r\n“Working?” she said.\r\n\r\n“Hard,” I answered. “Where have YOU been?”\r\n\r\n“At the Vallerys'. Mr. Evesham was talking about you. They were all\r\ntalking. I don't think everybody knew who I was. Just Mrs. Mumble I'd\r\nbeen to them. Lord Wardenham doesn't like you.”\r\n\r\n“He doesn't.”\r\n\r\n“But they all feel you're rather big, anyhow. Then I went on to Park\r\nLane to hear a new pianist and some other music at Eva's.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then I looked in at the Brabants' for some midnight tea before I came\r\non here. They'd got some writers--and Grant was there.”\r\n\r\n“You HAVE been flying round....”\r\n\r\nThere was a little pause between us.\r\n\r\nI looked at her pretty, unsuspecting face, and at the slender grace of\r\nher golden-robed body. What gulfs there were between us! “You've been\r\namused,” I said.\r\n\r\n“It's been amusing. You've been at the House?”\r\n\r\n“The Medical Education Bill kept me.”...\r\n\r\nAfter all, why should I tell her? She'd got to a way of living that\r\nfulfilled her requirements. Perhaps she'd never hear. But all that day\r\nand the day before I'd been making up my mind to do the thing.\r\n\r\n“I want to tell you something,” I said. “I wish you'd sit down for a\r\nmoment or so.”...\r\n\r\nOnce I had begun, it seemed to me I had to go through with it.\r\n\r\nSomething in the quality of my voice gave her an intimation of unusual\r\ngravity. She looked at me steadily for a moment and sat down slowly in\r\nmy armchair.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” she said.\r\n\r\nI went on awkwardly. “I've got to tell you--something extraordinarily\r\ndistressing,” I said.\r\n\r\nShe was manifestly altogether unaware.\r\n\r\n“There seems to be a good deal of scandal abroad--I've only recently\r\nheard of it--about myself--and Isabel.”\r\n\r\n“Isabel!”\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n“What do they say?” she asked.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult, I found, to speak.\r\n\r\n“They say she's my mistress.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! How abominable!”\r\n\r\nShe spoke with the most natural indignation. Our eyes met.\r\n\r\n“We've been great friends,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Yes. And to make THAT of it. My poor dear! But how can they?” She\r\npaused and looked at me. “It's so incredible. How can any one believe\r\nit? I couldn't.”\r\n\r\nShe stopped, with her distressed eyes regarding me. Her expression\r\nchanged to dread. There was a tense stillness for a second, perhaps.\r\n\r\nI turned my face towards the desk, and took up and dropped a handful of\r\npaper fasteners.\r\n\r\n“Margaret,” I said, “I'm afraid you'll have to believe it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\nMargaret sat very still. When I looked at her again, her face was very\r\nwhite, and her distressed eyes scrutinised me. Her lips quivered as she\r\nspoke. “You really mean--THAT?” she said.\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n“I never dreamt.”\r\n\r\n“I never meant you to dream.”\r\n\r\n“And that is why--we've been apart?”\r\n\r\nI thought. “I suppose it is.”\r\n\r\n“Why have you told me now?”\r\n\r\n“Those rumours. I didn't want any one else to tell you.”\r\n\r\n“Or else it wouldn't have mattered?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\nShe turned her eyes from me to the fire. Then for a moment she looked\r\nabout the room she had made for me, and then quite silently, with a\r\nchildish quivering of her lips, with a sort of dismayed distress upon\r\nher face, she was weeping. She sat weeping in her dress of cloth of\r\ngold, with her bare slender arms dropped limp over the arms of her\r\nchair, and her eyes averted from me, making no effort to stay or staunch\r\nher tears. “I am sorry, Margaret,” I said. “I was in love.... I did not\r\nunderstand....”\r\n\r\nPresently she asked: “What are you going to do?”\r\n\r\n“You see, Margaret, now it's come to be your affair--I want to know what\r\nyou--what you want.”\r\n\r\n“You want to leave me?”\r\n\r\n“If you want me to, I must.”\r\n\r\n“Leave Parliament--leave all the things you are doing,--all this fine\r\nmovement of yours?”\r\n\r\n“No.” I spoke sullenly. “I don't want to leave anything. I want to stay\r\non. I've told you, because I think we--Isabel and I, I mean--have got to\r\ndrive through a storm of scandal anyhow. I don't know how far things may\r\ngo, how much people may feel, and I can't, I can't have you unconscious,\r\nunarmed, open to any revelation--”\r\n\r\nShe made no answer.\r\n\r\n“When the thing began--I knew it was stupid but I thought it was a\r\nthing that wouldn't change, wouldn't be anything but itself, wouldn't\r\nunfold--consequences.... People have got hold of these vague rumours....\r\nDirectly it reached any one else but--but us two--I saw it had to come\r\nto you.”\r\n\r\nI stopped. I had that distressful feeling I have always had with\r\nMargaret, of not being altogether sure she heard, of being doubtful\r\nif she understood. I perceived that once again I had struck at her and\r\nshattered a thousand unsubstantial pinnacles. And I couldn't get at\r\nher, to help her, or touch her mind! I stood up, and at my movement she\r\nmoved. She produced a dainty little handkerchief, and made an effort to\r\nwipe her face with it, and held it to her eyes. “Oh, my Husband!” she\r\nsobbed.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean to do?” she said, with her voice muffled by her\r\nhandkerchief.\r\n\r\n“We're going to end it,” I said.\r\n\r\nSomething gripped me tormentingly as I said that. I drew a chair beside\r\nher and sat down. “You and I, Margaret, have been partners,” I began.\r\n“We've built up this life of ours together; I couldn't have done it\r\nwithout you. We've made a position, created a work--”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. “You,” she said.\r\n\r\n“You helping. I don't want to shatter it--if you don't want it\r\nshattered. I can't leave my work. I can't leave you. I want you to\r\nhave--all that you have ever had. I've never meant to rob you. I've made\r\nan immense and tragic blunder. You don't know how things took us, how\r\ndifferent they seemed! My character and accident have conspired--We'll\r\npay--in ourselves, not in our public service.”\r\n\r\nI halted again. Margaret remained very still.\r\n\r\n“I want you to understand that the thing is at an end. It is definitely\r\nat an end. We--we talked--yesterday. We mean to end it altogether.” I\r\nclenched my hands. “She's--she's going to marry Arnold Shoesmith.”\r\n\r\nI wasn't looking now at Margaret any more, but I heard the rustle of her\r\nmovement as she turned on me.\r\n\r\n“It's all right,” I said, clinging to my explanation. “We're doing\r\nnothing shabby. He knows. He will. It's all as right--as things can\r\nbe now. We're not cheating any one, Margaret. We're doing things\r\nstraight--now. Of course, you know.... We shall--we shall have to make\r\nsacrifices. Give things up pretty completely. Very completely.... We\r\nshall have not to see each other for a time, you know. Perhaps not a\r\nlong time. Two or three years. Or write--or just any of that sort of\r\nthing ever--”\r\n\r\nSome subconscious barrier gave way in me. I found myself crying\r\nuncontrollably--as I have never cried since I was a little child. I was\r\namazed and horrified at myself. And wonderfully, Margaret was on her\r\nknees beside me, with her arms about me, mingling her weeping with mine.\r\n“Oh, my Husband!” she cried, “my poor Husband! Does it hurt you so? I\r\nwould do anything! Oh, the fool I am! Dear, I love you. I love you over\r\nand away and above all these jealous little things!”\r\n\r\nShe drew down my head to her as a mother might draw down the head of\r\na son. She caressed me, weeping bitterly with me. “Oh! my dear,” she\r\nsobbed, “my dear! I've never seen you cry! I've never seen you cry.\r\nEver! I didn't know you could. Oh! my dear! Can't you have her, my dear,\r\nif you want her? I can't bear it! Let me help you, dear. Oh! my Husband!\r\nMy Man! I can't bear to have you cry!” For a time she held me in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n“I've thought this might happen, I dreamt it might happen. You two, I\r\nmean. It was dreaming put it into my head. When I've seen you together,\r\nso glad with each other.... Oh! Husband mine, believe me! believe me!\r\nI'm stupid, I'm cold, I'm only beginning to realise how stupid and cold,\r\nbut all I want in all the world is to give my life to you.”...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\r\n“We can't part in a room,” said Isabel.\r\n\r\n“We'll have one last talk together,” I said, and planned that we should\r\nmeet for a half a day between Dover and Walmer and talk ourselves out.\r\nI still recall that day very well, recall even the curious exaltation of\r\ngrief that made our mental atmosphere distinctive and memorable. We had\r\nseen so much of one another, had become so intimate, that we talked of\r\nparting even as we parted with a sense of incredible remoteness. We went\r\ntogether up over the cliffs, and to a place where they fall towards the\r\nsea, past the white, quaint-lanterned lighthouses of the South Foreland.\r\nThere, in a kind of niche below the crest, we sat talking. It was a\r\nspacious day, serenely blue and warm, and on the wrinkled water remotely\r\nbelow a black tender and six hooded submarines came presently, and\r\nengaged in mysterious manoeuvers. Shrieking gulls and chattering\r\njackdaws circled over us and below us, and dived and swooped; and a\r\nskerry of weedy, fallen chalk appeared, and gradually disappeared again,\r\nas the tide fell and rose.\r\n\r\nWe talked and thought that afternoon on every aspect of our relations.\r\nIt seems to me now we talked so wide and far that scarcely an issue in\r\nthe life between man and woman can arise that we did not at least touch\r\nupon. Lying there at Isabel's feet, I have become for myself a symbol of\r\nall this world-wide problem between duty and conscious, passionate love\r\nthe world has still to solve. Because it isn't solved; there's a wrong\r\nin it either way.. .. The sky, the wide horizon, seemed to lift us out\r\nof ourselves until we were something representative and general. She was\r\nwomanhood become articulate, talking to her lover.\r\n\r\n“I ought,” I said, “never to have loved you.”\r\n\r\n“It wasn't a thing planned,” she said.\r\n\r\n“I ought never to have let our talk slip to that, never to have turned\r\nback from America.”\r\n\r\n“I'm glad we did it,” she said. “Don't think I repent.”\r\n\r\nI looked at her.\r\n\r\n“I will never repent,” she said. “Never!” as though she clung to her\r\nlife in saying it.\r\n\r\nI remember we talked for a long time of divorce. It seemed to us then,\r\nand it seems to us still, that it ought to have been possible for\r\nMargaret to divorce me, and for me to marry without the scandalous and\r\nugly publicity, the taint and ostracism that follow such a readjustment.\r\nWe went on to the whole perplexing riddle of marriage. We criticised\r\nthe current code, how muddled and conventionalised it had become, how\r\nmodified by subterfuges and concealments and new necessities, and the\r\nincreasing freedom of women. “It's all like Bromstead when the building\r\ncame,” I said; for I had often talked to her of that early impression of\r\npurpose dissolving again into chaotic forces. “There is no clear right\r\nin the world any more. The world is Byzantine. The justest man to-day\r\nmust practise a tainted goodness.”\r\n\r\nThese questions need discussion--a magnificent frankness of\r\ndiscussion--if any standards are again to establish an effective hold\r\nupon educated people. Discretions, as I have said already, will never\r\nhold any one worth holding--longer than they held us. Against every\r\n“shalt not” there must be a “why not” plainly put,--the “why not”\r\n largest and plainest, the law deduced from its purpose. “You and I,\r\nIsabel,” I said, “have always been a little disregardful of duty, partly\r\nat least because the idea of duty comes to us so ill-clad. Oh! I know\r\nthere's an extravagant insubordinate strain in us, but that wasn't all.\r\nI wish humbugs would leave duty alone. I wish all duty wasn't covered\r\nwith slime. That's where the real mischief comes in. Passion can always\r\ncontrive to clothe itself in beauty, strips itself splendid. That\r\ncarried us. But for all its mean associations there is this duty....\r\n\r\n“Don't we come rather late to it?”\r\n\r\n“Not so late that it won't be atrociously hard to do.”\r\n\r\n“It's queer to think of now,” said Isabel. “Who could believe we did all\r\nwe have done honestly? Well, in a manner honestly. Who could believe we\r\nthought this might be hidden? Who could trace it all step by step from\r\nthe time when we found that a certain boldness in our talk was pleasing?\r\nWe talked of love.... Master, there's not much for us to do in the way\r\nof Apologia that any one will credit. And yet if it were possible to\r\ntell the very heart of our story....\r\n\r\n“Does Margaret really want to go on with you?” she asked--“shield\r\nyou--knowing of... THIS?”\r\n\r\n“I'm certain. I don't understand--just as I don't understand Shoesmith,\r\nbut she does. These people walk on solid ground which is just thin air\r\nto us. They've got something we haven't got. Assurances? I wonder.”...\r\n\r\nThen it was, or later, we talked of Shoesmith, and what her life might\r\nbe with him.\r\n\r\n“He's good,” she said; “he's kindly. He's everything but magic. He's the\r\nvery image of the decent, sober, honourable life. You can't say a thing\r\nagainst him or I--except that something--something in his imagination,\r\nsomething in the tone of his voice--fails for me. Why don't I love\r\nhim?--he's a better man than you! Why don't you? IS he a better man than\r\nyou? He's usage, he's honour, he's the right thing, he's the breed and\r\nthe tradition,--a gentleman. You're your erring, incalculable self. I\r\nsuppose we women will trust this sort and love your sort to the very end\r\nof time....”\r\n\r\nWe lay side by side and nibbled at grass stalks as we talked. It seemed\r\nenormously unreasonable to us that two people who had come to the pitch\r\nof easy and confident affection and happiness that held between us\r\nshould be obliged to part and shun one another, or murder half the\r\nsubstance of their lives. We felt ourselves crushed and beaten by an\r\nindiscriminating machine which destroys happiness in the service of\r\njealousy. “The mass of people don't feel these things in quite the same\r\nmanner as we feel them,” she said. “Is it because they're different in\r\ngrain, or educated out of some primitive instinct?”\r\n\r\n“It's because we've explored love a little, and they know no more\r\nthan the gateway,” I said. “Lust and then jealousy; their simple\r\nconception--and we have gone past all that and wandered hand in\r\nhand....”\r\n\r\nI remember that for a time we watched two of that larger sort of gull,\r\nwhose wings are brownish-white, circle and hover against the blue. And\r\nthen we lay and looked at a band of water mirror clear far out to sea,\r\nand wondered why the breeze that rippled all the rest should leave it so\r\nserene.\r\n\r\n“And in this State of ours,” I resumed.\r\n\r\n“Eh!” said Isabel, rolling over into a sitting posture and looking out\r\nat the horizon. “Let's talk no more of things we can never see. Talk to\r\nme of the work you are doing and all we shall do--after we have parted.\r\nWe've said too little of that. We've had our red life, and it's over.\r\nThank Heaven!--though we stole it! Talk about your work, dear, and the\r\nthings we'll go on doing--just as though we were still together. We'll\r\nstill be together in a sense--through all these things we have in\r\ncommon.”\r\n\r\nAnd so we talked of politics and our outlook. We were interested to the\r\npitch of self-forgetfulness. We weighed persons and forces, discussed\r\nthe probabilities of the next general election, the steady drift of\r\npublic opinion in the north and west away from Liberalism towards us.\r\nIt was very manifest that in spite of Wardenham and the EXPURGATOR, we\r\nshould come into the new Government strongly. The party had no one else,\r\nall the young men were formally or informally with us; Esmeer would have\r\noffice, Lord Tarvrille, I... and very probably there would be something\r\nfor Shoesmith. “And for my own part,” I said, “I count on backing on the\r\nLiberal side. For the last two years we've been forcing competition in\r\nconstructive legislation between the parties. The Liberals have not been\r\nlong in following up our Endowment of Motherhood lead. They'll have to\r\ngive votes and lip service anyhow. Half the readers of the BLUE WEEKLY,\r\nthey say, are Liberals....\r\n\r\n“I remember talking about things of this sort with old Willersley,” I\r\nsaid, “ever so many years ago. It was some place near Locarno, and we\r\nlooked down the lake that shone weltering--just as now we look over the\r\nsea. And then we dreamt in an indistinct featureless way of all that you\r\nand I are doing now.”\r\n\r\n“I!” said Isabel, and laughed.\r\n\r\n“Well, of some such thing,” I said, and remained for awhile silent,\r\nthinking of Locarno.\r\n\r\nI recalled once more the largeness, the release from small personal\r\nthings that I had felt in my youth; statecraft became real and wonderful\r\nagain with the memory, the gigantic handling of gigantic problems. I\r\nbegan to talk out my thoughts, sitting up beside her, as I could never\r\ntalk of them to any one but Isabel; began to recover again the\r\npurpose that lay under all my political ambitions and adjustments and\r\nanticipations. I saw the State, splendid and wide as I had seen it in\r\nthat first travel of mine, but now it was no mere distant prospect of\r\nspires and pinnacles, but populous with fine-trained, bold-thinking,\r\nbold-doing people. It was as if I had forgotten for a long time and now\r\nremembered with amazement.\r\n\r\nAt first, I told her, I had been altogether at a loss how I could do\r\nanything to battle against the aimless muddle of our world; I had\r\nwanted a clue--until she had come into my life questioning, suggesting,\r\nunconsciously illuminating. “But I have done nothing,” she protested. I\r\ndeclared she had done everything in growing to education under my eyes,\r\nin reflecting again upon all the processes that had made myself, so\r\nthat instead of abstractions and blue-books and bills and devices, I had\r\nrealised the world of mankind as a crowd needing before all things fine\r\nwomen and men. We'd spoilt ourselves in learning that, but anyhow we had\r\nour lesson. Before her I was in a nineteenth-century darkness, dealing\r\nwith the nation as if it were a crowd of selfish men, forgetful of women\r\nand children and that shy wild thing in the hearts of men, love, which\r\nmust be drawn upon as it has never been drawn upon before, if the State\r\nis to live. I saw now how it is possible to bring the loose factors of a\r\ngreat realm together, to create a mind of literature and thought in it,\r\nand the expression of a purpose to make it self-conscious and fine.\r\nI had it all clear before me, so that at a score of points I could\r\npresently begin. The BLUE WEEKLY was a centre of force. Already we had\r\ngiven Imperialism a criticism, and leavened half the press from our\r\ncolumns. Our movement consolidated and spread. We should presently come\r\ninto power. Everything moved towards our hands. We should be able to get\r\nat the schools, the services, the universities, the church; enormously\r\nincrease the endowment of research, and organise what was sorely wanted,\r\na criticism of research; contrive a closer contact between the press and\r\ncreative intellectual life; foster literature, clarify, strengthen the\r\npublic consciousness, develop social organisation and a sense of the\r\nState. Men were coming to us every day, brilliant young peers like Lord\r\nDentonhill, writers like Carnot and Cresswell. It filled me with pride\r\nto win such men. “We stand for so much more than we seem to stand for,”\r\n I said. I opened my heart to her, so freely that I hesitate to open my\r\nheart even to the reader, telling of projects and ambitions I cherished,\r\nof my consciousness of great powers and widening opportunities....\r\n\r\nIsabel watched me as I talked.\r\n\r\nShe too, I think, had forgotten these things for a while. For it is\r\ncurious and I think a very significant thing that since we had become\r\nlovers, we had talked very little of the broader things that had once so\r\nstrongly gripped our imaginations.\r\n\r\n“It's good,” I said, “to talk like this to you, to get back to youth and\r\ngreat ambitions with you. There have been times lately when politics has\r\nseemed the pettiest game played with mean tools for mean ends--and none\r\nthe less so that the happiness of three hundred million people might be\r\ntouched by our follies. I talk to no one else like this.... And now I\r\nthink of parting, I think but of how much more I might have talked to\r\nyou.”...\r\n\r\nThings drew to an end at last, but after we had spoken of a thousand\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n“We've talked away our last half day,” I said, staring over my shoulder\r\nat the blazing sunset sky behind us. “Dear, it's been the last day of\r\nour lives for us.... It doesn't seem like the last day of our lives. Or\r\nany day.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder how it will feel?” said Isabel.\r\n\r\n“It will be very strange at first--not to be able to tell you things.”\r\n\r\n“I've a superstition that after--after we've parted--if ever I go into\r\nmy room and talk, you'll hear. You'll be--somewhere.”\r\n\r\n“I shall be in the world--yes.”\r\n\r\n“I don't feel as though these days ahead were real. Here we are, here we\r\nremain.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I feel that. As though you and I were two immortals, who didn't\r\nlive in time and space at all, who never met, who couldn't part, and\r\nhere we lie on Olympus. And those two poor creatures who did meet, poor\r\nlittle Richard Remington and Isabel Rivers, who met and loved too much\r\nand had to part, they part and go their ways, and we lie here and watch\r\nthem, you and I. She'll cry, poor dear.”\r\n\r\n“She'll cry. She's crying now!”\r\n\r\n“Poor little beasts! I think he'll cry too. He winces. He could--for\r\ntuppence. I didn't know he had lachrymal glands at all until a little\r\nwhile ago. I suppose all love is hysterical--and a little foolish. Poor\r\nmites! Silly little pitiful creatures! How we have blundered! Think how\r\nwe must look to God! Well, we'll pity them, and then we'll inspire him\r\nto stiffen up again--and do as we've determined he shall do. We'll see\r\nit through,--we who lie here on the cliff. They'll be mean at times, and\r\nhorrid at times; we know them! Do you see her, a poor little fine lady\r\nin a great house,--she sometimes goes to her room and writes.”\r\n\r\n“She writes for his BLUE WEEKLY still.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Sometimes--I hope. And he's there in the office with a bit of her\r\ncopy in his hand.”\r\n\r\n“Is it as good as if she still talked it over with him before she wrote\r\nit? Is it?”\r\n\r\n“Better, I think. Let's play it's better--anyhow. It may be that talking\r\nover was rather mixed with love-making. After all, love-making is joy\r\nrather than magic. Don't let's pretend about that even.... Let's go on\r\nwatching him. (I don't see why her writing shouldn't be better. Indeed I\r\ndon't.) See! There he goes down along the Embankment to Westminster just\r\nlike a real man, for all that he's smaller than a grain of dust. What is\r\nrunning round inside that speck of a head of his? Look at him going past\r\nthe Policemen, specks too--selected large ones from the country. I think\r\nhe's going to dinner with the Speaker--some old thing like that. Is his\r\nface harder or commoner or stronger?--I can't quite see.... And now he's\r\nup and speaking in the House. Hope he'll hold on to the thread. He'll\r\nhave to plan his speeches to the very end of his days--and learn the\r\nheadings.”\r\n\r\n“Isn't she up in the women's gallery to hear him?”\r\n\r\n“No. Unless it's by accident.”\r\n\r\n“She's there,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Well, by accident it happens. Not too many accidents, Isabel. Never any\r\nmore adventures for us, dear, now. No!... They play the game, you know.\r\nThey've begun late, but now they've got to. You see it's not so\r\nvery hard for them since you and I, my dear, are here always, always\r\nfaithfully here on this warm cliff of love accomplished, watching and\r\nhelping them under high heaven. It isn't so VERY hard. Rather good in\r\nsome ways. Some people HAVE to be broken a little. Can you see Altiora\r\ndown there, by any chance?”\r\n\r\n“She's too little to be seen,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Can you see the sins they once committed?”\r\n\r\n“I can only see you here beside me, dear--for ever. For all my life,\r\ndear, till I die. Was that--the sin?”...\r\n\r\nI took her to the station, and after she had gone I was to drive to\r\nDover, and cross to Calais by the night boat. I couldn't, I felt, return\r\nto London. We walked over the crest and down to the little station of\r\nMartin Mill side by side, talking at first in broken fragments, for the\r\nmost part of unimportant things.\r\n\r\n“None of this,” she said abruptly, “seems in the slightest degree real\r\nto me. I've got no sense of things ending.”\r\n\r\n“We're parting,” I said.\r\n\r\n“We're parting--as people part in a play. It's distressing. But I don't\r\nfeel as though you and I were really never to see each other again for\r\nyears. Do you?”\r\n\r\nI thought. “No,” I said.\r\n\r\n“After we've parted I shall look to talk it over with you.”\r\n\r\n“So shall I.”\r\n\r\n“That's absurd.”\r\n\r\n“Absurd.”\r\n\r\n“I feel as if you'd always be there, just about where you are now.\r\nInvisible perhaps, but there. We've spent so much of our lives joggling\r\nelbows.”...\r\n\r\n“Yes. Yes. I don't in the least realise it. I suppose I shall begin to\r\nwhen the train goes out of the station. Are we wanting in imagination,\r\nIsabel?”\r\n\r\n“I don't know. We've always assumed it was the other way about.”\r\n\r\n“Even when the train goes out of the station--! I've seen you into so\r\nmany trains.”\r\n\r\n“I shall go on thinking of things to say to you--things to put in your\r\nletters. For years to come. How can I ever stop thinking in that way\r\nnow? We've got into each other's brains.”\r\n\r\n“It isn't real,” I said; “nothing is real. The world's no more than a\r\nfantastic dream. Why are we parting, Isabel?”\r\n\r\n“I don't know. It seems now supremely silly. I suppose we have to. Can't\r\nwe meet?--don't you think we shall meet even in dreams?”\r\n\r\n“We'll meet a thousand times in dreams,” I said.\r\n\r\n“I wish we could dream at the same time,” said Isabel.... “Dream walks.\r\nI can't believe, dear, I shall never have a walk with you again.”\r\n\r\n“If I'd stayed six months in America,” I said, “we might have walked\r\nlong walks and talked long talks for all our lives.”\r\n\r\n“Not in a world of Baileys,” said Isabel. “And anyhow--”\r\n\r\nShe stopped short. I looked interrogation.\r\n\r\n“We've loved,” she said.\r\n\r\nI took her ticket, saw to her luggage, and stood by the door of the\r\ncompartment. “Good-bye,” I said a little stiffly, conscious of the\r\npeople upon the platform. She bent above me, white and dusky, looking at\r\nme very steadfastly.\r\n\r\n“Come here,” she whispered. “Never mind the porters. What can they know?\r\nJust one time more--I must.”\r\n\r\nShe rested her hand against the door of the carriage and bent down upon\r\nme, and put her cold, moist lips to mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE THIRD ~~ THE BREAKING POINT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then we broke down. We broke our faith with both Margaret and\r\nShoesmith, flung career and duty out of our lives, and went away\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nIt is only now, almost a year after these events, that I can begin to\r\nsee what happened to me. At the time it seemed to me I was a rational,\r\nresponsible creature, but indeed I had not parted from her two days\r\nbefore I became a monomaniac to whom nothing could matter but Isabel.\r\nEvery truth had to be squared to that obsession, every duty. It astounds\r\nme to think how I forgot Margaret, forgot my work, forgot everything\r\nbut that we two were parted. I still believe that with better chances\r\nwe might have escaped the consequences of the emotional storm that\r\npresently seized us both. But we had no foresight of that, and no\r\npreparation for it, and our circumstances betrayed us. It was partly\r\nShoesmith's unwisdom in delaying his marriage until after the end of the\r\nsession--partly my own amazing folly in returning within four days to\r\nWestminster. But we were all of us intent upon the defeat of scandal\r\nand the complete restoration of appearances. It seemed necessary that\r\nShoesmith's marriage should not seem to be hurried, still more necessary\r\nthat I should not vanish inexplicably. I had to be visible with Margaret\r\nin London just as much as possible; we went to restaurants, we visited\r\nthe theatre; we could even contemplate the possibility of my presence at\r\nthe wedding. For that, however, we had schemed a weekend visit to Wales,\r\nand a fictitious sprained ankle at the last moment which would justify\r\nmy absence....\r\n\r\nI cannot convey to you the intolerable wretchedness and rebellion of\r\nmy separation from Isabel. It seemed that in the past two years all\r\nmy thoughts had spun commisures to Isabel's brain and I could think of\r\nnothing that did not lead me surely to the need of the one intimate I\r\nhad found in the world. I came back to the House and the office and my\r\nhome, I filled all my days with appointments and duty, and it did not\r\nsave me in the least from a lonely emptiness such as I had never felt\r\nbefore in all my life. I had little sleep. In the daytime I did a\r\nhundred things, I even spoke in the House on two occasions, and by my\r\nown low standards spoke well, and it seemed to me that I was going about\r\nin my own brain like a hushed survivor in a house whose owner lies dead\r\nupstairs.\r\n\r\nI came to a crisis after that wild dinner of Tarvrille's. Something in\r\nthat stripped my soul bare.\r\n\r\nIt was an occasion made absurd and strange by the odd accident that the\r\nhouse caught fire upstairs while we were dining below. It was a men's\r\ndinner--“A dinner of all sorts,” said Tarvrille, when he invited me;\r\n“everything from Evesham and Gane to Wilkins the author, and Heaven\r\nknows what will happen!” I remember that afterwards Tarvrille was\r\naccused of having planned the fire to make his dinner a marvel and a\r\nmemory. It was indeed a wonderful occasion, and I suppose if I had not\r\nbeen altogether drenched in misery, I should have found the same wild\r\namusement in it that glowed in all the others. There were one or two\r\nuniversity dons, Lord George Fester, the racing man, Panmure, the\r\nartist, two or three big City men, Weston Massinghay and another\r\nprominent Liberal whose name I can't remember, the three men Tarvrille\r\nhad promised and Esmeer, Lord Wrassleton, Waulsort, the member for\r\nMonckton, Neal and several others. We began a little coldly, with\r\nduologues, but the conversation was already becoming general--so far as\r\nsuch a long table permitted--when the fire asserted itself.\r\n\r\nIt asserted itself first as a penetrating and emphatic smell of burning\r\nrubber,--it was caused by the fusing of an electric wire. The reek\r\nforced its way into the discussion of the Pekin massacres that had\r\nsprung up between Evesham, Waulsort, and the others at the end of the\r\ntable. “Something burning,” said the man next to me.\r\n\r\n“Something must be burning,” said Panmure.\r\n\r\nTarvrille hated undignified interruptions. He had a particularly\r\nimperturbable butler with a cadaverous sad face and an eye of rigid\r\ndisapproval. He spoke to this individual over his shoulder. “Just see,\r\nwill you,” he said, and caught up the pause in the talk to his left.\r\n\r\nWilkins was asking questions, and I, too, was curious. The story of the\r\nsiege of the Legations in China in the year 1900 and all that followed\r\nupon that, is just one of those disturbing interludes in history that\r\nrefuse to join on to that general scheme of protestation by which\r\ncivilisation is maintained. It is a break in the general flow of\r\nexperience as disconcerting to statecraft as the robbery of my knife and\r\nthe scuffle that followed it had been to me when I was a boy at Penge.\r\nIt is like a tear in a curtain revealing quite unexpected backgrounds. I\r\nhad never given the business a thought for years; now this talk brought\r\nback a string of pictures to my mind; how the reliefs arrived and the\r\nplundering began, how section after section of the International Army\r\nwas drawn into murder and pillage, how the infection spread upward\r\nuntil the wives of Ministers were busy looting, and the very sentinels\r\nstripped and crawled like snakes into the Palace they were set to guard.\r\nIt did not stop at robbery, men were murdered, women, being plundered,\r\nwere outraged, children were butchered, strong men had found themselves\r\nwith arms in a lawless, defenceless city, and this had followed. Now it\r\nwas all recalled.\r\n\r\n“Respectable ladies addicted to district visiting at home were as bad as\r\nany one,” said Panmure. “Glazebrook told me of one--flushed like a woman\r\nat a bargain sale, he said--and when he pointed out to her that the silk\r\nshe'd got was bloodstained, she just said, 'Oh, bother!' and threw it\r\naside and went back....”\r\n\r\nWe became aware that Tarvrille's butler had returned. We tried not to\r\nseem to listen.\r\n\r\n“Beg pardon, m'lord,” he said. “The house IS on fire, m'lord.”\r\n\r\n“Upstairs, m'lord.”\r\n\r\n“Just overhead, m'lord.”\r\n\r\n“The maids are throwing water, m'lord, and I've telephoned FIRE.”\r\n\r\n“No, m'lord, no immediate danger.”\r\n\r\n“It's all right,” said Tarvrille to the table generally. “Go on! It's\r\nnot a general conflagration, and the fire brigade won't be five minutes.\r\nDon't see that it's our affair. The stuff's insured. They say old Lady\r\nPaskershortly was dreadful. Like a harpy. The Dowager Empress had shown\r\nher some little things of hers. Pet things--hidden away. Susan went\r\nstraight for them--used to take an umbrella for the silks. Born\r\nshoplifter.”\r\n\r\nIt was evident he didn't want his dinner spoilt, and we played up\r\nloyally.\r\n\r\n“This is recorded history,” said Wilkins,--“practically. It makes one\r\nwonder about unrecorded history. In India, for example.”\r\n\r\nBut nobody touched that.\r\n\r\n“Thompson,” said Tarvrille to the imperturbable butler, and indicating\r\nthe table generally, “champagne. Champagne. Keep it going.”\r\n\r\n“M'lord,” and Thompson marshalled his assistants.\r\n\r\nSome man I didn't know began to remember things about Mandalay. “It's\r\nqueer,” he said, “how people break out at times;” and told his story\r\nof an army doctor, brave, public-spirited, and, as it happened,\r\ndeeply religious, who was caught one evening by the excitement of\r\nplundering--and stole and hid, twisted the wrist of a boy until it\r\nbroke, and was afterwards overcome by wild remorse.\r\n\r\nI watched Evesham listening intently. “Strange,” he said, “very strange.\r\nWe are such stuff as thieves are made of. And in China, too, they\r\nmurdered people--for the sake of murdering. Apart, so to speak, from\r\nmercenary considerations. I'm afraid there's no doubt of it in certain\r\ncases. No doubt at all. Young soldiers fresh from German high schools\r\nand English homes!”\r\n\r\n“Did OUR people?” asked some patriot.\r\n\r\n“Not so much. But I'm afraid there were cases.... Some of the Indian\r\ntroops were pretty bad.”\r\n\r\nGane picked up the tale with confirmations.\r\n\r\nIt is all printed in the vividest way as a picture upon my memory, so\r\nthat were I a painter I think I could give the deep rich browns and warm\r\ngreys beyond the brightly lit table, the various distinguished faces,\r\nstrongly illuminated, interested and keen, above the black and white of\r\nevening dress, the alert menservants with their heavier, clean-shaved\r\nfaces indistinctly seen in the dimness behind. Then this was coloured\r\nemotionally for me by my aching sense of loss and sacrifice, and by\r\nthe chance trend of our talk to the breaches and unrealities of the\r\ncivilised scheme. We seemed a little transitory circle of light in a\r\nuniverse of darkness and violence; an effect to which the diminishing\r\nsmell of burning rubber, the trampling of feet overhead, the swish\r\nof water, added enormously. Everybody--unless, perhaps, it was\r\nEvesham--drank rather carelessly because of the suppressed excitement of\r\nour situation, and talked the louder and more freely.\r\n\r\n“But what a flimsy thing our civilisation is!” said Evesham; “a mere\r\nthin net of habits and associations!”\r\n\r\n“I suppose those men came back,” said Wilkins.\r\n\r\n“Lady Paskershortly did!” chuckled Evesham.\r\n\r\n“How do they fit it in with the rest of their lives?” Wilkins\r\nspeculated. “I suppose there's Pekin-stained police officers,\r\nPekin-stained J. P.'s--trying petty pilferers in the severest\r\nmanner.”...\r\n\r\nThen for a time things became preposterous. There was a sudden cascade\r\nof water by the fireplace, and then absurdly the ceiling began to rain\r\nupon us, first at this point and then that. “My new suit!” cried some\r\none. “Perrrrrr-up pe-rr”--a new vertical line of blackened water would\r\nestablish itself and form a spreading pool upon the gleaming cloth. The\r\nmen nearest would arrange catchment areas of plates and flower bowls.\r\n“Draw up!” said Tarvrille, “draw up. That's the bad end of the table!”\r\n He turned to the imperturbable butler. “Take round bath towels,” he\r\nsaid; and presently the men behind us were offering--with inflexible\r\ndignity--“Port wine, Sir. Bath towel, Sir!” Waulsort, with streaks of\r\nblackened water on his forehead, was suddenly reminded of a wet year\r\nwhen he had followed the French army manoeuvres. An animated dispute\r\nsprang up between him and Neal about the relative efficiency of the new\r\nFrench and German field guns. Wrassleton joined in and a little drunken\r\nshrivelled Oxford don of some sort with a black-splashed shirt front who\r\npresently silenced them all by the immensity and particularity of his\r\nknowledge of field artillery. Then the talk drifted to Sedan and the\r\neffect of dead horses upon drinking-water, which brought Wrassleton\r\nand Weston Massinghay into a dispute of great vigour and emphasis. “The\r\ntrouble in South Africa,” said Weston Massinghay, “wasn't that we didn't\r\nboil our water. It was that we didn't boil our men. The Boers drank the\r\nsame stuff we did. THEY didn't get dysentery.”\r\n\r\nThat argument went on for some time. I was attacked across the table by\r\na man named Burshort about my Endowment of Motherhood schemes, but\r\nin the gaps of that debate I could still hear Weston Massinghay\r\nat intervals repeat in a rather thickened voice: “THEY didn't get\r\ndysentery.”\r\n\r\nI think Evesham went early. The rest of us clustered more and more\r\nclosely towards the drier end of the room, the table was pushed along,\r\nand the area beneath the extinguished conflagration abandoned to a\r\ntinkling, splashing company of pots and pans and bowls and baths.\r\nEverybody was now disposed to be hilarious and noisy, to say startling\r\nand aggressive things; we must have sounded a queer clamour to a\r\nlistener in the next room. The devil inspired them to begin baiting me.\r\n“Ours isn't the Tory party any more,” said Burshort. “Remington has made\r\nit the Obstetric Party.”\r\n\r\n“That's good!” said Weston Massinghay, with all his teeth gleaming; “I\r\nshall use that against you in the House!”\r\n\r\n“I shall denounce you for abusing private confidences if you do,” said\r\nTarvrille.\r\n\r\n“Remington wants us to give up launching Dreadnoughts and launch babies\r\ninstead,” Burshort urged. “For the price of one Dreadnought--”\r\n\r\nThe little shrivelled don who had been omniscient about guns joined in\r\nthe baiting, and displayed himself a venomous creature. Something in\r\nhis eyes told me he knew Isabel and hated me for it. “Love and fine\r\nthinking,” he began, a little thickly, and knocking over a wine-glass\r\nwith a too easy gesture. “Love and fine thinking. Two things don't go\r\ntogether. No philosophy worth a damn ever came out of excesses of love.\r\nSalt Lake City--Piggott--Ag--Agapemone again--no works to matter.”\r\n\r\nEverybody laughed.\r\n\r\n“Got to rec'nise these facts,” said my assailant. “Love and fine think'n\r\npretty phrase--attractive. Suitable for p'litical dec'rations. Postcard,\r\nChristmas, gilt lets, in a wreath of white flow's. Not oth'wise\r\nvalu'ble.”\r\n\r\nI made some remark, I forget what, but he overbore me.\r\n\r\nReal things we want are Hate--Hate and COARSE think'n. I b'long to the\r\nschool of Mrs. F's Aunt--”\r\n\r\n“What?” said some one, intent.\r\n\r\n“In 'Little Dorrit,'” explained Tarvrille; “go on!”\r\n\r\n“Hate a fool,” said my assailant.\r\n\r\nTarvrille glanced at me. I smiled to conceal the loss of my temper.\r\n\r\n“Hate,” said the little man, emphasising his point with a clumsy fist.\r\n“Hate's the driving force. What's m'rality?--hate of rotten goings\r\non. What's patriotism?--hate of int'loping foreigners. What's\r\nRadicalism?--hate of lords. What's Toryism?--hate of disturbance. It's\r\nall hate--hate from top to bottom. Hate of a mess. Remington owned it\r\nthe other day, said he hated a mu'll. There you are! If you couldn't\r\nget hate into an election, damn it (hic) people wou'n't poll. Poll for\r\nlove!--no' me!”\r\n\r\nHe paused, but before any one could speak he had resumed.\r\n\r\n“Then this about fine thinking. Like going into a bear pit armed with a\r\ntagle--talgent--talgent galv'nometer. Like going to fight a mad dog with\r\nShasepear and the Bible. Fine thinking--what we want is the thickes'\r\nthinking we can get. Thinking that stands up alone. Taf Reform means\r\nwork for all, thassort of thing.”\r\n\r\nThe gentleman from Cambridge paused. “YOU a flag!” he said. “I'd as soon\r\ngo to ba'ell und' wet tissue paper!”\r\n\r\nMy best answer on the spur of the moment was:\r\n\r\n“The Japanese did.” Which was absurd.\r\n\r\nI went on to some other reply, I forget exactly what, and the talk of\r\nthe whole table drew round me. It was an extraordinary revelation to me.\r\nEvery one was unusually careless and outspoken, and it was amazing how\r\nmanifestly they echoed the feeling of this old Tory spokesman. They were\r\nquite friendly to me, they regarded me and the BLUE WEEKLY as valuable\r\nparty assets for Toryism, but it was clear they attached no more\r\nimportance to what were my realities than they did to the remarkable\r\ntherapeutic claims of Mrs. Eddy. They were flushed and amused, perhaps\r\nthey went a little too far in their resolves to draw me, but they left\r\nthe impression on my mind of men irrevocably set upon narrow and cynical\r\nviews of political life. For them the political struggle was a game,\r\nwhose counters were human hate and human credulity; their real aim was\r\njust every one's aim, the preservation of the class and way of living to\r\nwhich their lives were attuned. They did not know how tired I was, how\r\nexhausted mentally and morally, nor how cruel their convergent attack\r\non me chanced to be. But my temper gave way, I became tart and fierce,\r\nperhaps my replies were a trifle absurd, and Tarvrille, with that quick\r\neye and sympathy of his, came to the rescue. Then for a time I sat\r\nsilent and drank port wine while the others talked. The disorder of\r\nthe room, the still dripping ceiling, the noise, the displaced ties and\r\ncrumpled shirts of my companions, jarred on my tormented nerves....\r\n\r\nIt was long past midnight when we dispersed. I remember Tarvrille coming\r\nwith me into the hall, and then suggesting we should go upstairs to see\r\nthe damage. A manservant carried up two flickering candles for us.\r\nOne end of the room was gutted, curtains, hangings, several chairs and\r\ntables were completely burnt, the panelling was scorched and warped,\r\nthree smashed windows made the candles flare and gutter, and some scraps\r\nof broken china still lay on the puddled floor.\r\n\r\nAs we surveyed this, Lady Tarvrille appeared, back from some party,\r\na slender, white-cloaked, satin-footed figure with amazed blue eyes\r\nbeneath her golden hair. I remember how stupidly we laughed at her\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\nI parted from Panmure at the corner of Aldington Street, and went my way\r\nalone. But I did not go home, I turned westward and walked for a long\r\nway, and then struck northward aimlessly. I was too miserable to go to\r\nmy house.\r\n\r\nI wandered about that night like a man who has discovered his Gods\r\nare dead. I can look back now detached yet sympathetic upon that wild\r\nconfusion of moods and impulses, and by it I think I can understand, oh!\r\nhalf the wrongdoing and blundering in the world.\r\n\r\nI do not feel now the logical force of the process that must have\r\nconvinced me then that I had made my sacrifice and spent my strength in\r\nvain. At no time had I been under any illusion that the Tory party had\r\nhigher ideals than any other party, yet it came to me like a thing newly\r\ndiscovered that the men I had to work with had for the most part no such\r\ndreams, no sense of any collective purpose, no atom of the faith I held.\r\nThey were just as immediately intent upon personal ends, just as limited\r\nby habits of thought, as the men in any other group or party. Perhaps I\r\nhad slipped unawares for a time into the delusions of a party man--but I\r\ndo not think so.\r\n\r\nNo, it was the mood of profound despondency that had followed upon the\r\nabrupt cessation of my familiar intercourse with Isabel, that gave this\r\nfact that had always been present in my mind its quality of devastating\r\nrevelation. It seemed as though I had never seen before nor suspected\r\nthe stupendous gap between the chaotic aims, the routine, the\r\nconventional acquiescences, the vulgarisations of the personal life, and\r\nthat clearly conscious development and service of a collective thought\r\nand purpose at which my efforts aimed. I had thought them but a little\r\nway apart, and now I saw they were separated by all the distance\r\nbetween earth and heaven. I saw now in myself and every one around me,\r\na concentration upon interests close at hand, an inability to detach\r\noneself from the provocations, tendernesses, instinctive hates, dumb\r\nlusts and shy timidities that touched one at every point; and, save\r\nfor rare exalted moments, a regardlessness of broader aims and remoter\r\npossibilities that made the white passion of statecraft seem as\r\nunearthly and irrelevant to human life as the story an astronomer will\r\ntell, half proven but altogether incredible, of habitable planets and\r\nanswering intelligences, suns' distances uncounted across the deep. It\r\nseemed to me I had aspired too high and thought too far, had mocked my\r\nown littleness by presumption, had given the uttermost dear reality of\r\nlife for a theoriser's dream.\r\n\r\nAll through that wandering agony of mine that night a dozen threads of\r\nthought interwove; now I was a soul speaking in protest to God against\r\na task too cold and high for it, and now I was an angry man, scorned and\r\npointed upon, who had let life cheat him of the ultimate pride of his\r\nsoul. Now I was the fool of ambition, who opened his box of gold to find\r\nblank emptiness, and now I was a spinner of flimsy thoughts, whose web\r\ntore to rags at a touch. I realised for the first time how much I had\r\ncome to depend upon the mind and faith of Isabel, how she had confirmed\r\nme and sustained me, how little strength I had to go on with our\r\npurposes now that she had vanished from my life. She had been the\r\nincarnation of those great abstractions, the saving reality, the voice\r\nthat answered back. There was no support that night in the things that\r\nhad been. We were alone together on the cliff for ever more!--that was\r\nvery pretty in its way, but it had no truth whatever that could help\r\nme now, no ounce of sustaining value. I wanted Isabel that night, no\r\nsentiment or memory of her, but Isabel alive,--to talk to me, to touch\r\nme, to hold me together. I wanted unendurably the dusky gentleness of\r\nher presence, the consolation of her voice.\r\n\r\nWe were alone together on the cliff! I startled a passing cabman into\r\ninterest by laughing aloud at that magnificent and characteristic\r\nsentimentality. What a lie it was, and how satisfying it had been! That\r\nwas just where we shouldn't remain. We of all people had no distinction\r\nfrom that humanity whose lot is to forget. We should go out to other\r\ninterests, new experiences, new demands. That tall and intricate fabric\r\nof ambitious understandings we had built up together in our intimacy\r\nwould be the first to go; and last perhaps to endure with us would be\r\na few gross memories of sights and sounds, and trivial incidental\r\nexcitements....\r\n\r\nI had a curious feeling that night that I had lost touch with life for\r\na long time, and had now been reminded of its quality. That infernal\r\nlittle don's parody of my ruling phrase, “Hate and coarse thinking,”\r\n stuck in my thoughts like a poisoned dart, a centre of inflammation.\r\nJust as a man who is debilitated has no longer the vitality to resist\r\nan infection, so my mind, slackened by the crisis of my separation from\r\nIsabel, could find no resistance to his emphatic suggestion. It seemed\r\nto me that what he had said was overpoweringly true, not only of\r\ncontemporary life, but of all possible human life. Love is the rare\r\nthing, the treasured thing; you lock it away jealously and watch, and\r\nwell you may; hate and aggression and force keep the streets and rule\r\nthe world. And fine thinking is, in the rough issues of life, weak\r\nthinking, is a balancing indecisive process, discovers with disloyal\r\nimpartiality a justice and a defect on each disputing side. “Good honest\r\nmen,” as Dayton calls them, rule the world, with a way of thinking\r\nout decisions like shooting cartloads of bricks, and with a steadfast\r\npleasure in hostility. Dayton liked to call his antagonists “blaggards\r\nand scoundrels”--it justified his opposition--the Lords were\r\n“scoundrels,” all people richer than he were “scoundrels,” all\r\nSocialists, all troublesome poor people; he liked to think of jails and\r\njustice being done. His public spirit was saturated with the sombre\r\njoys of conflict and the pleasant thought of condign punishment for\r\nall recalcitrant souls. That was the way of it, I perceived. That had\r\nsurvival value, as the biologists say. He was fool enough in politics to\r\nbe a consistent and happy politician....\r\n\r\nHate and coarse thinking; how the infernal truth of the phrase beat me\r\ndown that night! I couldn't remember that I had known this all along,\r\nand that it did not really matter in the slightest degree. I had worked\r\nit all out long ago in other terms, when I had seen how all parties\r\nstood for interests inevitably, and how the purpose in life achieves\r\nitself, if it achieves itself at all, as a bye product of the war\r\nof individuals and classes. Hadn't I always known that science and\r\nphilosophy elaborate themselves in spite of all the passion and\r\nnarrowness of men, in spite of the vanities and weakness of their\r\nservants, in spite of all the heated disorder of contemporary things?\r\nWasn't it my own phrase to speak of “that greater mind in men, in which\r\nwe are but moments and transitorily lit cells?” Hadn't I known that the\r\nspirit of man still speaks like a thing that struggles out of mud and\r\nslime, and that the mere effort to speak means choking and disaster?\r\nHadn't I known that we who think without fear and speak without\r\ndiscretion will not come to our own for the next two thousand years?\r\n\r\nIt was the last was most forgotten of all that faith mislaid. Before\r\nmankind, in my vision that night, stretched new centuries of confusion,\r\nvast stupid wars, hastily conceived laws, foolish temporary triumphs\r\nof order, lapses, set-backs, despairs, catastrophes, new beginnings, a\r\nmultitudinous wilderness of time, a nigh plotless drama of wrong-headed\r\nenergies. In order to assuage my parting from Isabel we had set\r\nourselves to imagine great rewards for our separation, great personal\r\nrewards; we had promised ourselves success visible and shining in our\r\nlives. To console ourselves in our separation we had made out of\r\nthe BLUE WEEKLY and our young Tory movement preposterously enormous\r\nthings-as though those poor fertilising touches at the soil were indeed\r\nthe germinating seeds of the millennium, as though a million lives such\r\nas ours had not to contribute before the beginning of the beginning.\r\nThat poor pretence had failed. That magnificent proposition shrivelled\r\nto nothing in the black loneliness of that night.\r\n\r\nI saw that there were to be no such compensations. So far as my real\r\nservices to mankind were concerned I had to live an unrecognised\r\nand unrewarded life. If I made successes it would be by the way. Our\r\nseparation would alter nothing of that. My scandal would cling to me\r\nnow for all my life, a thing affecting relationships, embarrassing and\r\nhampering my spirit. I should follow the common lot of those who live by\r\nthe imagination, and follow it now in infinite loneliness of soul; the\r\none good comforter, the one effectual familiar, was lost to me for\r\never; I should do good and evil together, no one caring to understand;\r\nI should produce much weary work, much bad-spirited work, much absolute\r\nevil; the good in me would be too often ill-expressed and missed or\r\nmisinterpreted. In the end I might leave one gleaming flake or so amidst\r\nthe slag heaps for a moment of postmortem sympathy. I was afraid beyond\r\nmeasure of my derelict self. Because I believed with all my soul in love\r\nand fine thinking that did not mean that I should necessarily either\r\nlove steadfastly or think finely. I remember how I fell talking to\r\nGod--I think I talked out loud. “Why do I care for these things?”\r\n I cried, “when I can do so little! Why am I apart from the jolly\r\nthoughtless fighting life of men? These dreams fade to nothingness, and\r\nleave me bare!”\r\n\r\nI scolded. “Why don't you speak to a man, show yourself? I thought I\r\nhad a gleam of you in Isabel,--and then you take her away. Do you really\r\nthink I can carry on this game alone, doing your work in darkness and\r\nsilence, living in muddled conflict, half living, half dying?”\r\n\r\nGrotesque analogies arose in my mind. I discovered a strange parallelism\r\nbetween my now tattered phrase of “Love and fine thinking” and the\r\n“Love and the Word” of Christian thought. Was it possible the Christian\r\npropaganda had at the outset meant just that system of attitudes I had\r\nbeen feeling my way towards from the very beginning of my life? Had\r\nI spent a lifetime making my way back to Christ? It mocks humanity\r\nto think how Christ has been overlaid. I went along now, recalling\r\nlong-neglected phrases and sentences; I had a new vision of that great\r\ncentral figure preaching love with hate and coarse thinking even in the\r\ndisciples about Him, rising to a tidal wave at last in that clamour for\r\nBarabbas, and the public satisfaction in His fate....\r\n\r\nIt's curious to think that hopeless love and a noisy disordered dinner\r\nshould lead a man to these speculations, but they did. “He DID mean\r\nthat!” I said, and suddenly thought of what a bludgeon they'd made\r\nof His Christianity. Athwart that perplexing, patient enigma sitting\r\ninaudibly among publicans and sinners, danced and gibbered a long\r\nprocession of the champions of orthodoxy. “He wasn't human,” I said,\r\nand remembered that last despairing cry, “My God! My God! why hast Thou\r\nforsaken Me?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, HE forsakes every one,” I said, flying out as a tired mind will,\r\nwith an obvious repartee....\r\n\r\nI passed at a bound from such monstrous theology to a towering rage\r\nagainst the Baileys. In an instant and with no sense of absurdity I\r\nwanted--in the intervals of love and fine thinking--to fling about that\r\nstrenuously virtuous couple; I wanted to kick Keyhole of the PEEPSHOW\r\ninto the gutter and make a common massacre of all the prosperous\r\nrascaldom that makes a trade and rule of virtue. I can still feel that\r\ntransition. In a moment I had reached that phase of weakly decisive\r\nanger which is for people of my temperament the concomitant of\r\nexhaustion.\r\n\r\n“I will have her,” I cried. “By Heaven! I WILL have her! Life mocks me\r\nand cheats me. Nothing can be made good to me again.... Why shouldn't I\r\nsave what I can? I can't save myself without her....”\r\n\r\nI remember myself--as a sort of anti-climax to that--rather tediously\r\nasking my way home. I was somewhere in the neighbourhood of Holland\r\nPark....\r\n\r\nIt was then between one and two. I felt that I could go home now without\r\nany risk of meeting Margaret. It had been the thought of returning to\r\nMargaret that had sent me wandering that night. It is one of the ugliest\r\nfacts I recall about that time of crisis, the intense aversion I felt\r\nfor Margaret. No sense of her goodness, her injury and nobility, and\r\nthe enormous generosity of her forgiveness, sufficed to mitigate that.\r\nI hope now that in this book I am able to give something of her silvery\r\nsplendour, but all through this crisis I felt nothing of that. There was\r\na triumphant kindliness about her that I found intolerable. She meant to\r\nbe so kind to me, to offer unstinted consolation, to meet my needs, to\r\nsupply just all she imagined Isabel had given me.\r\n\r\nWhen I left Tarvrille's, I felt I could anticipate exactly how she would\r\nmeet my homecoming. She would be perplexed by my crumpled shirt front,\r\non which I had spilt some drops of wine; she would overlook that by an\r\neffort, explain it sentimentally, resolve it should make no difference\r\nto her. She would want to know who had been present, what we had talked\r\nabout, show the alertest interest in whatever it was--it didn't matter\r\nwhat.... No, I couldn't face her.\r\n\r\nSo I did not reach my study until two o'clock.\r\n\r\nThere, I remember, stood the new and very beautiful old silver\r\ncandlesticks that she had set there two days since to please me--the\r\nfoolish kindliness of it! But in her search for expression, Margaret\r\nheaped presents upon me. She had fitted these candlesticks with electric\r\nlights, and I must, I suppose, have lit them to write my note to Isabel.\r\n“Give me a word--the world aches without you,” was all I scrawled,\r\nthough I fully meant that she should come to me. I knew, though I ought\r\nnot to have known, that now she had left her flat, she was with the\r\nBalfes--she was to have been married from the Balfes--and I sent my\r\nletter there. And I went out into the silent square and posted the note\r\nforthwith, because I knew quite clearly that if I left it until morning\r\nI should never post it at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nI had a curious revulsion of feeling that morning of our meeting. (Of\r\nall places for such a clandestine encounter she had chosen the bridge\r\nopposite Buckingham Palace.) Overnight I had been full of self pity, and\r\neager for the comfort of Isabel's presence. But the ill-written scrawl\r\nin which she had replied had been full of the suggestion of her own\r\nweakness and misery. And when I saw her, my own selfish sorrows were\r\naltogether swept away by a wave of pitiful tenderness. Something had\r\nhappened to her that I did not understand. She was manifestly ill. She\r\ncame towards me wearily, she who had always borne herself so bravely;\r\nher shoulders seemed bent, and her eyes were tired, and her face white\r\nand drawn. All my life has been a narrow self-centred life; no brothers,\r\nno sisters or children or weak things had ever yet made any intimate\r\nappeal to me, and suddenly--I verily believe for the first time in my\r\nlife!--I felt a great passion of protective ownership; I felt that here\r\nwas something that I could die to shelter, something that meant more\r\nthan joy or pride or splendid ambitions or splendid creation to me, a\r\nnew kind of hold upon me, a new power in the world. Some sealed fountain\r\nwas opened in my breast. I knew that I could love Isabel broken, Isabel\r\nbeaten, Isabel ugly and in pain, more than I could love any sweet\r\nor delightful or glorious thing in life. I didn't care any more for\r\nanything in the world but Isabel, and that I should protect her. I\r\ntrembled as I came near her, and could scarcely speak to her for the\r\nemotion that filled me....\r\n\r\n“I had your letter,” I said.\r\n\r\n“I had yours.”\r\n\r\n“Where can we talk?”\r\n\r\nI remember my lame sentences. “We'll have a boat. That's best here.”\r\n\r\nI took her to the little boat-house, and there we hired a boat, and\r\nI rowed in silence under the bridge and into the shade of a tree. The\r\nsquare grey stone masses of the Foreign Office loomed through the twigs,\r\nI remember, and a little space of grass separated us from the pathway\r\nand the scrutiny of passers-by. And there we talked.\r\n\r\n“I had to write to you,” I said.\r\n\r\n“I had to come.”\r\n\r\n“When are you to be married?”\r\n\r\n“Thursday week.”\r\n\r\n“Well?” I said. “But--can we?”\r\n\r\nShe leant forward and scrutinised my face with eyes wide open. “What do\r\nyou mean?” she said at last in a whisper.\r\n\r\n“Can we stand it? After all?”\r\n\r\nI looked at her white face. “Can you?” I said.\r\n\r\nShe whispered. “Your career?”\r\n\r\nThen suddenly her face was contorted,--she wept silently, exactly as a\r\nchild tormented beyond endurance might suddenly weep....\r\n\r\n“Oh! I don't care,” I cried, “now. I don't care. Damn the whole system\r\nof things! Damn all this patching of the irrevocable! I want to take\r\ncare of you, Isabel! and have you with me.”\r\n\r\n“I can't stand it,” she blubbered.\r\n\r\n“You needn't stand it. I thought it was best for you.... I thought\r\nindeed it was best for you. I thought even you wanted it like that.”\r\n\r\n“Couldn't I live alone--as I meant to do?”\r\n\r\n“No,” I said, “you couldn't. You're not strong enough. I've thought of\r\nthat; I've got to shelter you.”\r\n\r\n“And I want you,” I went on. “I'm not strong enough--I can't stand life\r\nwithout you.”\r\n\r\nShe stopped weeping, she made a great effort to control herself, and\r\nlooked at me steadfastly for a moment. “I was going to kill myself,” she\r\nwhispered. “I was going to kill myself quietly--somehow. I meant to wait\r\na bit and have an accident. I thought--you didn't understand. You were a\r\nman, and couldn't understand....”\r\n\r\n“People can't do as we thought we could do,” I said. “We've gone too far\r\ntogether.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said, and I stared into her eyes.\r\n\r\n“The horror of it,” she whispered. “The horror of being handed over.\r\nIt's just only begun to dawn upon me, seeing him now as I do. He tries\r\nto be kind to me.... I didn't know. I felt adventurous before.... It\r\nmakes me feel like all the women in the world who have ever been owned\r\nand subdued.... It's not that he isn't the best of men, it's because I'm\r\na part of you.... I can't go through with it. If I go through with it, I\r\nshall be left--robbed of pride--outraged--a woman beaten....”\r\n\r\n“I know,” I said, “I know.”\r\n\r\n“I want to live alone.... I don't care for anything now but just escape.\r\nIf you can help me....”\r\n\r\n“I must take you away. There's nothing for us but to go away together.”\r\n\r\n“But your work,” she said; “your career! Margaret! Our promises!”\r\n\r\n“We've made a mess of things, Isabel--or things have made a mess of us.\r\nI don't know which. Our flags are in the mud, anyhow. It's too late\r\nto save those other things! They have to go. You can't make terms with\r\ndefeat. I thought it was Margaret needed me most. But it's you. And I\r\nneed you. I didn't think of that either. I haven't a doubt left in the\r\nworld now. We've got to leave everything rather than leave each other.\r\nI'm sure of it. Now we have gone so far. We've got to go right down to\r\nearth and begin again.... Dear, I WANT disgrace with you....”\r\n\r\nSo I whispered to her as she sat crumpled together on the faded cushions\r\nof the boat, this white and weary young woman who had been so valiant\r\nand careless a girl. “I don't care,” I said. “I don't care for anything,\r\nif I can save you out of the wreckage we have made together.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day I went to the office of the BLUE WEEKLY in order to get as\r\nmuch as possible of its affairs in working order before I left London\r\nwith Isabel. I just missed Shoesmith in the lower office. Upstairs I\r\nfound Britten amidst a pile of outside articles, methodically reading\r\nthe title of each and sometimes the first half-dozen lines, and either\r\ndropping them in a growing heap on the floor for a clerk to return, or\r\nputting them aside for consideration. I interrupted him, squatted on\r\nthe window-sill of the open window, and sketched out my ideas for the\r\nsession.\r\n\r\n“You're far-sighted,” he remarked at something of mine which reached out\r\nahead.\r\n\r\n“I like to see things prepared,” I answered.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, and ripped open the envelope of a fresh aspirant.\r\n\r\nI was silent while he read.\r\n\r\n“You're going away with Isabel Rivers,” he said abruptly.\r\n\r\n“Well!” I said, amazed.\r\n\r\n“I know,” he said, and lost his breath. “Not my business. Only--”\r\n\r\nIt was queer to find Britten afraid to say a thing.\r\n\r\n“It's not playing the game,” he said.\r\n\r\n“What do you know?”\r\n\r\n“Everything that matters.”\r\n\r\n“Some games,” I said, “are too hard to play.”\r\n\r\nThere came a pause between us.\r\n\r\n“I didn't know you were watching all this,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he answered, after a pause, “I've watched.”\r\n\r\n“Sorry--sorry you don't approve.”\r\n\r\n“It means smashing such an infernal lot of things, Remington.”\r\n\r\nI did not answer.\r\n\r\n“You're going away then?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Soon?”\r\n\r\n“Right away.”\r\n\r\n“There's your wife.”\r\n\r\n“I know.”\r\n\r\n“Shoesmith--whom you're pledged to in a manner. You've just picked him\r\nout and made him conspicuous. Every one will know. Oh! of course--it's\r\nnothing to you. Honour--”\r\n\r\n“I know.”\r\n\r\n“Common decency.”\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n“All this movement of ours. That's what I care for most.... It's come to\r\nbe a big thing, Remington.”\r\n\r\n“That will go on.”\r\n\r\n“We have a use for you--no one else quite fills it. No one.... I'm not\r\nsure it will go on.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think I haven't thought of all these things?”\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders, and rejected two papers unread.\r\n\r\n“I knew,” he remarked, “when you came back from America. You were alight\r\nwith it.” Then he let his bitterness gleam for a moment. “But I thought\r\nyou would stick to your bargain.”\r\n\r\n“It's not so much choice as you think,” I said.\r\n\r\n“There's always a choice.”\r\n\r\n“No,” I said.\r\n\r\nHe scrutinised my face.\r\n\r\n“I can't live without her--I can't work. She's all mixed up with\r\nthis--and everything. And besides, there's things you can't understand.\r\nThere's feelings you've never felt.... You don't understand how much\r\nwe've been to one another.”\r\n\r\nBritten frowned and thought.\r\n\r\n“Some things one's GOT to do,” he threw out.\r\n\r\n“Some things one can't do.”\r\n\r\n“These infernal institutions--”\r\n\r\n“Some one must begin,” I said.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. “Not YOU,” he said. “No!”\r\n\r\nHe stretched out his hands on the desk before him, and spoke again.\r\n\r\n“Remington,” he said, “I've thought of this business day and night too.\r\nIt matters to me. It matters immensely to me. In a way--it's a thing\r\none doesn't often say to a man--I've loved you. I'm the sort of man who\r\nleads a narrow life.... But you've been something fine and good for me,\r\nsince that time, do you remember? when we talked about Mecca together.”\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n“Yes. And you'll always be something fine and good for me anyhow. I know\r\nthings about you,--qualities--no mere act can destroy them.. .. Well, I\r\ncan tell you, you're doing wrong. You're going on now like a man who is\r\nhypnotised and can't turn round. You're piling wrong on wrong. It was\r\nwrong for you two people ever to be lovers.”\r\n\r\nHe paused.\r\n\r\n“It gripped us hard,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Yes!--but in your position! And hers! It was vile!”\r\n\r\n“You've not been tempted.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know? Anyhow--having done that, you ought to have stood the\r\nconsequences and thought of other people. You could have ended it at the\r\nfirst pause for reflection. You didn't. You blundered again. You kept\r\non. You owed a certain secrecy to all of us! You didn't keep it.\r\nYou were careless. You made things worse. This engagement and this\r\npublicity!--Damn it, Remington!”\r\n\r\n“I know,” I said, with smarting eyes. “Damn it! with all my heart! It\r\ncame of trying to patch.... You CAN'T patch.”\r\n\r\n“And now, as I care for anything under heaven, Remington, you two ought\r\nto stand these last consequences--and part. You ought to part. Other\r\npeople have to stand things! Other people have to part. You ought to.\r\nYou say--what do you say? It's loss of so much life to lose each other.\r\nSo is losing a hand or a leg. But it's what you've incurred. Amputate.\r\nTake your punishment--After all, you chose it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, damn!” I said, standing up and going to the window.\r\n\r\n“Damn by all means. I never knew a topic so full of justifiable damns.\r\nBut you two did choose it. You ought to stick to your undertaking.”\r\n\r\nI turned upon him with a snarl in my voice. “My dear Britten!” I cried.\r\n“Don't I KNOW I'm doing wrong? Aren't I in a net? Suppose I don't go!\r\nIs there any right in that? Do you think we're going to be much to\r\nourselves or any one after this parting? I've been thinking all\r\nlast night of this business, trying it over and over again from the\r\nbeginning. How was it we went wrong? Since I came back from America--I\r\ngrant you THAT--but SINCE, there's never been a step that wasn't forced,\r\nthat hadn't as much right in it or more, as wrong. You talk as though I\r\nwas a thing of steel that could bend this way or that and never change.\r\nYou talk as though Isabel was a cat one could give to any kind of\r\nowner.... We two are things that change and grow and alter all the time.\r\nWe're--so interwoven that being parted now will leave us just misshapen\r\ncripples.... You don't know the motives, you don't know the rush and\r\nfeel of things, you don't know how it was with us, and how it is with\r\nus. You don't know the hunger for the mere sight of one another; you\r\ndon't know anything.”\r\n\r\nBritten looked at his finger-nails closely. His red face puckered to\r\na wry frown. “Haven't we all at times wanted the world put back?” he\r\ngrunted, and looked hard and close at one particular nail.\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause.\r\n\r\n“I want her,” I said, “and I'm going to have her. I'm too tired for\r\nbalancing the right or wrong of it any more. You can't separate them.\r\nI saw her yesterday.... She's--ill.... I'd take her now, if death were\r\njust outside the door waiting for us.”\r\n\r\n“Torture?”\r\n\r\nI thought. “Yes.”\r\n\r\n“For her?”\r\n\r\n“There isn't,” I said.\r\n\r\n“If there was?”\r\n\r\nI made no answer.\r\n\r\n“It's blind Want. And there's nothing ever been put into you to stand\r\nagainst it. What are you going to do with the rest of your lives?”\r\n\r\n“No end of things.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing.”\r\n\r\n“I don't believe you are right,” I said. “I believe we can save\r\nsomething--”\r\n\r\nBritten shook his head. “Some scraps of salvage won't excuse you,” he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nHis indignation rose. “In the middle of life!” he said. “No man has a\r\nright to take his hand from the plough!”\r\n\r\nHe leant forward on his desk and opened an argumentative palm. “You\r\nknow, Remington,” he said, “and I know, that if this could be fended off\r\nfor six months--if you could be clapped in prison, or got out of the way\r\nsomehow,--until this marriage was all over and settled down for a year,\r\nsay--you know then you two could meet, curious, happy, as friends.\r\nSaved! You KNOW it.”\r\n\r\nI turned and stared at him. “You're wrong, Britten,” I said. “And does\r\nit matter if we could?”\r\n\r\nI found that in talking to him I could frame the apologetics I had not\r\nbeen able to find for myself alone.\r\n\r\n“I am certain of one thing, Britten. It is our duty not to hush up this\r\nscandal.”\r\n\r\nHe raised his eyebrows. I perceived now the element of absurdity in me,\r\nbut at the time I was as serious as a man who is burning.\r\n\r\n“It's our duty,” I went on, “to smash now openly in the sight of every\r\none. Yes! I've got that as clean and plain--as prison whitewash. I am\r\nconvinced that we have got to be public to the uttermost now--I mean\r\nit--until every corner of our world knows this story, knows it fully,\r\nadds it to the Parnell story and the Ashton Dean story and the Carmel\r\nstory and the Witterslea story, and all the other stories that have\r\npicked man after man out of English public life, the men with active\r\nimaginations, the men of strong initiative. To think this tottering\r\nold-woman ridden Empire should dare to waste a man on such a score! You\r\nsay I ought to be penitent--”\r\n\r\nBritten shook his head and smiled very faintly.\r\n\r\n“I'm boiling with indignation,” I said. “I lay in bed last night and\r\nwent through it all. What in God's name was to be expected of us but\r\nwhat has happened? I went through my life bit by bit last night, I\r\nrecalled all I've had to do with virtue and women, and all I was told\r\nand how I was prepared. I was born into cowardice and debasement. We all\r\nare. Our generation's grimy with hypocrisy. I came to the most beautiful\r\nthings in life--like peeping Tom of Coventry. I was never given a light,\r\nnever given a touch of natural manhood by all this dingy, furtive,\r\ncanting, humbugging English world. Thank God! I'll soon be out of it!\r\nThe shame of it! The very savages in Australia initiate their children\r\nbetter than the English do to-day. Neither of us was ever given a\r\nview of what they call morality that didn't make it show as shabby\r\nsubservience, as the meanest discretion, an abject submission to\r\nunreasonable prohibitions! meek surrender of mind and body to the\r\ndictation of pedants and old women and fools. We weren't taught--we\r\nwere mumbled at! And when we found that the thing they called unclean,\r\nunclean, was Pagan beauty--God! it was a glory to sin, Britten, it was a\r\npride and splendour like bathing in the sunlight after dust and grime!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Britten. “That's all very well--”\r\n\r\nI interrupted him. “I know there's a case--I'm beginning to think it a\r\nvalid case against us; but we never met it! There's a steely pride in\r\nself restraint, a nobility of chastity, but only for those who see and\r\nthink and act--untrammeled and unafraid. The other thing, the current\r\nthing, why! it's worth as much as the chastity of a monkey kept in a\r\ncage by itself!” I put my foot in a chair, and urged my case upon him.\r\n“This is a dirty world, Britten, simply because it is a muddled world,\r\nand the thing you call morality is dirtier now than the thing you call\r\nimmorality. Why don't the moralists pick their stuff out of the slime\r\nif they care for it, and wipe it?--damn them! I am burning now to say:\r\n'Yes, we did this and this,' to all the world. All the world!... I\r\nwill!”\r\n\r\nBritten rubbed the palm of his hand on the corner of his desk. “That's\r\nall very well, Remington,” he said. “You mean to go.”\r\n\r\nHe stopped and began again. “If you didn't know you were in the wrong\r\nyou wouldn't be so damned rhetorical. You're in the wrong. It's as plain\r\nto you as it is to me. You're leaving a big work, you're leaving a wife\r\nwho trusted you, to go and live with your jolly mistress.... You won't\r\nsee you're a statesman that matters, that no single man, maybe, might\r\ncome to such influence as you in the next ten years. You're throwing\r\nyourself away and accusing your country of rejecting you.”\r\n\r\nHe swung round upon his swivel at me. “Remington,” he said, “have you\r\nforgotten the immense things our movement means?”\r\n\r\nI thought. “Perhaps I am rhetorical,” I said.\r\n\r\n“But the things we might achieve! If you'd only stay now--even now! Oh!\r\nyou'd suffer a little socially, but what of that? You'd be able to go\r\non--perhaps all the better for hostility of the kind you'd get. You\r\nknow, Remington--you KNOW.”\r\n\r\nI thought and went back to his earlier point. “If I am rhetorical,\r\nat any rate it's a living feeling behind it. Yes, I remember all the\r\nimplications of our aims--very splendid, very remote. But just now it's\r\nrather like offering to give a freezing man the sunlit Himalayas from\r\nend to end in return for his camp-fire. When you talk of me and my jolly\r\nmistress, it isn't fair. That misrepresents everything. I'm not going\r\nout of this--for delights. That's the sort of thing men like Snuffles\r\nand Keyhole imagine--that excites them! When I think of the things\r\nthese creatures think! Ugh! But YOU know better? You know that physical\r\npassion that burns like a fire--ends clean. I'm going for love,\r\nBritten--if I sinned for passion. I'm going, Britten, because when I saw\r\nher the other day she HURT me. She hurt me damnably, Britten.... I've\r\nbeen a cold man--I've led a rhetorical life--you hit me with that\r\nword!--I put things in a windy way, I know, but what has got hold of\r\nme at last is her pain. She's ill. Don't you understand? She's a sick\r\nthing--a weak thing. She's no more a goddess than I'm a god.... I'm\r\nnot in love with her now; I'm RAW with love for her. I feel like a man\r\nthat's been flayed. I have been flayed.... You don't begin to imagine\r\nthe sort of helpless solicitude.... She's not going to do things easily;\r\nshe's ill. Her courage fails.... It's hard to put things when one isn't\r\nrhetorical, but it's this, Britten--there are distresses that matter\r\nmore than all the delights or achievements in the world.... I made\r\nher what she is--as I never made Margaret. I've made her--I've broken\r\nher.... I'm going with my own woman. The rest of my life and England,\r\nand so forth, must square itself to that....”\r\n\r\nFor a long time, as it seemed, we remained silent and motionless. We'd\r\nsaid all we had to say. My eyes caught a printed slip upon the desk\r\nbefore him, and I came back abruptly to the paper.\r\n\r\nI picked up this galley proof. It was one of Winter's essays. “This\r\nman goes on doing first-rate stuff,” I said. “I hope you will keep him\r\ngoing.”\r\n\r\nHe did not answer for a moment or so. “I'll keep him going,” he said at\r\nlast with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a letter Margaret wrote me within a week of our flight. I cannot\r\nresist transcribing some of it here, because it lights things as no word\r\nof mine can do. It is a string of nearly inconsecutive thoughts written\r\nin pencil in a fine, tall, sprawling hand. Its very inconsecutiveness is\r\nessential. Many words are underlined. It was in answer to one from me;\r\nbut what I wrote has passed utterly from my mind....\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” she says, “I want to hear from you, but I do not want\r\nto see you. There's a sort of abstract YOU that I want to go on with.\r\nSomething I've made out of you.... I want to know things about you--but\r\nI don't want to see or feel or imagine. When some day I have got rid\r\nof my intolerable sense of proprietorship, it may be different. Then\r\nperhaps we may meet again. I think it is even more the loss of our\r\npolitical work and dreams that I am feeling than the loss of your\r\npresence. Aching loss. I thought so much of the things we were DOING for\r\nthe world--had given myself so unreservedly. You've left me with nothing\r\nto DO. I am suddenly at loose ends....\r\n\r\n“We women are trained to be so dependent on a man. I've got no life of\r\nmy own at all. It seems now to me that I wore my clothes even for you\r\nand your schemes....\r\n\r\n“After I have told myself a hundred times why this has happened, I ask\r\nagain, 'Why did he give things up? Why did he give things up?'...\r\n\r\n“It is just as though you were wilfully dead....\r\n\r\n“Then I ask again and again whether this thing need have happened at\r\nall, whether if I had had a warning, if I had understood better, I might\r\nnot have adapted myself to your restless mind and made this catastrophe\r\nimpossible....\r\n\r\n“Oh, my dear! why hadn't you the pluck to hurt me at the beginning, and\r\ntell me what you thought of me and life? You didn't give me a chance;\r\nnot a chance. I suppose you couldn't. All these things you and I stood\r\naway from. You let my first repugnances repel you....\r\n\r\n“It is strange to think after all these years that I should be asking\r\nmyself, do I love you? have I loved you? In a sense I think I HATE\r\nyou. I feel you have taken my life, dragged it in your wake for a time,\r\nthrown it aside. I am resentful. Unfairly resentful, for why should I\r\nexact that you should watch and understand my life, when clearly I have\r\nunderstood so little of yours. But I am savage--savage at the wrecking\r\nof all you were to do.\r\n\r\n“Oh, why--why did you give things up?\r\n\r\n“No human being is his own to do what he likes with. You were not\r\nonly pledged to my tiresome, ineffectual companionship, but to great\r\npurposes. They ARE great purposes....\r\n\r\n“If only I could take up your work as you leave it, with the strength\r\nyou had--then indeed I feel I could let you go--you and your young\r\nmistress.... All that matters so little to me....\r\n\r\n“Yet I think I must indeed love you yourself in my slower way. At times\r\nI am mad with jealousy at the thought of all I hadn't the wit to give\r\nyou.... I've always hidden my tears from you--and what was in my heart.\r\nIt's my nature to hide--and you, you want things brought to you to see.\r\nYou are so curious as to be almost cruel. You don't understand reserves.\r\nYou have no mercy with restraints and reservations. You are not really\r\na CIVILISED man at all. You hate pretences--and not only pretences but\r\ndecent coverings....\r\n\r\n“It's only after one has lost love and the chance of loving that slow\r\npeople like myself find what they might have done. Why wasn't I bold and\r\nreckless and abandoned? It's as reasonable to ask that, I suppose, as to\r\nask why my hair is fair....\r\n\r\n“I go on with these perhapses over and over again here when I find\r\nmyself alone....\r\n\r\n“My dear, my dear, you can't think of the desolation of things--I shall\r\nnever go back to that house we furnished together, that was to have been\r\nthe laboratory (do you remember calling it a laboratory?) in which you\r\nwere to forge so much of the new order....\r\n\r\n“But, dear, if I can help you--even now--in any way--help both of you, I\r\nmean.... It tears me when I think of you poor and discredited. You will\r\nlet me help you if I can--it will be the last wrong not to let me do\r\nthat....\r\n\r\n“You had better not get ill. If you do, and I hear of it--I shall come\r\nafter you with a troupe of doctor's and nurses. If I am a failure as a\r\nwife, no one has ever said I was anything but a success as a district\r\nvisitor....”\r\n\r\nThere are other sheets, but I cannot tell whether they were written\r\nbefore or after the ones from which I have quoted. And most of them\r\nhave little things too intimate to set down. But this oddly penetrating\r\nanalysis of our differences must, I think, be given.\r\n\r\n“There are all sorts of things I can't express about this and want to.\r\nThere's this difference that has always been between us, that you like\r\nnakedness and wildness, and I, clothing and restraint. It goes through\r\neverything. You are always TALKING of order and system, and the splendid\r\ndream of the order that might replace the muddled system you hate, but\r\nby a sort of instinct you seem to want to break the law. I've watched\r\nyou so closely. Now I want to obey laws, to make sacrifices, to follow\r\nrules. I don't want to make, but I do want to keep. You are at once\r\nmakers and rebels, you and Isabel too. You're bad people--criminal\r\npeople, I feel, and yet full of something the world must have. You're\r\nso much better than me, and so much viler. It may be there is no making\r\nwithout destruction, but it seems to me sometimes that it is nothing\r\nbut an instinct for lawlessness that drives you. You remind me--do you\r\nremember?--of that time we went from Naples to Vesuvius, and walked\r\nover the hot new lava there. Do you remember how tired I was? I know it\r\ndisappointed you that I was tired. One walked there in spite of the heat\r\nbecause there was a crust; like custom, like law. But directly a crust\r\nforms on things, you are restless to break down to the fire again.\r\nYou talk of beauty, both of you, as something terrible, mysterious,\r\nimperative. YOUR beauty is something altogether different from anything\r\nI know or feel. It has pain in it. Yet you always speak as though it was\r\nsomething I ought to feel and am dishonest not to feel. MY beauty is\r\na quiet thing. You have always laughed at my feeling for old-fashioned\r\nchintz and blue china and Sheraton. But I like all these familiar USED\r\nthings. My beauty is STILL beauty, and yours, is excitement. I\r\nknow nothing of the fascination of the fire, or why one should go\r\ndeliberately out of all the decent fine things of life to run dangers\r\nand be singed and tormented and destroyed. I don't understand....”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\r\nI remember very freshly the mood of our departure from London, the\r\nplatform of Charing Cross with the big illuminated clock overhead, the\r\nbustle of porters and passengers with luggage, the shouting of newsboys\r\nand boys with flowers and sweets, and the groups of friends seeing\r\ntravellers off by the boat train. Isabel sat very quiet and still in the\r\ncompartment, and I stood upon the platform with the door open, with\r\na curious reluctance to take the last step that should sever me from\r\nLondon's ground. I showed our tickets, and bought a handful of red roses\r\nfor her. At last came the guards crying: “Take your seats,” and I got\r\nin and closed the door on me. We had, thank Heaven! a compartment to\r\nourselves. I let down the window and stared out.\r\n\r\nThere was a bustle of final adieux on the platform, a cry of “Stand\r\naway, please, stand away!” and the train was gliding slowly and smoothly\r\nout of the station.\r\n\r\nI looked out upon the river as the train rumbled with slowly gathering\r\npace across the bridge, and the bobbing black heads of the pedestrians\r\nin the footway, and the curve of the river and the glowing great hotels,\r\nand the lights and reflections and blacknesses of that old, familiar\r\nspectacle. Then with a common thought, we turned our eyes westward to\r\nwhere the pinnacles of Westminster and the shining clock tower rose hard\r\nand clear against the still, luminous sky.\r\n\r\n“They'll be in Committee on the Reformatory Bill to-night,” I said, a\r\nlittle stupidly.\r\n\r\n“And so,” I added, “good-bye to London!”\r\n\r\nWe said no more, but watched the south-side streets below--bright gleams\r\nof lights and movement, and the dark, dim, monstrous shapes of houses\r\nand factories. We ran through Waterloo Station, London Bridge, New\r\nCross, St. John's. We said never a word. It seemed to me that for a time\r\nwe had exhausted our emotions. We had escaped, we had cut our knot,\r\nwe had accepted the last penalty of that headlong return of mine from\r\nChicago a year and a half ago. That was all settled. That harvest of\r\nfeelings we had reaped. I thought now only of London, of London as the\r\nsymbol of all we were leaving and all we had lost in the world. I felt\r\nnothing now but an enormous and overwhelming regret....\r\n\r\nThe train swayed and rattled on its way. We ran through old Bromstead,\r\nwhere once I had played with cities and armies on the nursery floor. The\r\nsprawling suburbs with their scattered lights gave way to dim tree-set\r\ncountry under a cloud-veiled, intermittently shining moon. We passed\r\nCardcaster Place. Perhaps old Wardingham, that pillar of the old\r\nConservatives, was there, fretting over his unsuccessful struggle with\r\nour young Toryism. Little he recked of this new turn of the wheel and\r\nhow it would confirm his contempt of all our novelties. Perhaps some\r\nfaint intimation drew him to the window to see behind the stems of the\r\nyoung fir trees that bordered his domain, the little string of lighted\r\ncarriage windows gliding southward....\r\n\r\nSuddenly I began to realise just what it was we were doing.\r\n\r\nAnd now, indeed, I knew what London had been to me, London where I\r\nhad been born and educated, the slovenly mother of my mind and all my\r\nambitions, London and the empire! It seemed to me we must be going\r\nout to a world that was utterly empty. All our significance fell from\r\nus--and before us was no meaning any more. We were leaving London; my\r\nhand, which had gripped so hungrily upon its complex life, had been\r\nforced from it, my fingers left their hold. That was over. I should\r\nnever have a voice in public affairs again. The inexorable unwritten\r\nlaw which forbids overt scandal sentenced me. We were going out to a\r\nnew life, a life that appeared in that moment to be a mere shrivelled\r\nremnant of me, a mere residuum of sheltering and feeding and seeing\r\namidst alien scenery and the sound of unfamiliar tongues. We were going\r\nto live cheaply in a foreign place, so cut off that I meet now the\r\nmerest stray tourist, the commonest tweed-clad stranger with a mixture\r\nof shyness and hunger.... And suddenly all the schemes I was leaving\r\nappeared fine and adventurous and hopeful as they had never done before.\r\nHow great was this purpose I had relinquished, this bold and subtle\r\nremaking of the English will! I had doubted so many things, and now\r\nsuddenly I doubted my unimportance, doubted my right to this suicidal\r\nabandonment. Was I not a trusted messenger, greatly trusted and\r\nfavoured, who had turned aside by the way? Had I not, after all, stood\r\nfor far more than I had thought; was I not filching from that dear great\r\ncity of my birth and life, some vitally necessary thing, a key, a link,\r\na reconciling clue in her political development, that now she might seek\r\nvaguely for in vain? What is one life against the State? Ought I not\r\nto have sacrificed Isabel and all my passion and sorrow for Isabel, and\r\nheld to my thing--stuck to my thing?\r\n\r\nI heard as though he had spoken it in the carriage Britten's “It WAS\r\na good game.” No end of a game. And for the first time I imagined the\r\nfaces and voices of Crupp and Esmeer and Gane when they learnt of\r\nthis secret flight, this flight of which they were quite unwarned. And\r\nShoesmith might be there in the house,--Shoesmith who was to have been\r\nmarried in four days--the thing might hit him full in front of any kind\r\nof people. Cruel eyes might watch him. Why the devil hadn't I written\r\nletters to warn them all? I could have posted them five minutes before\r\nthe train started. I had never thought to that moment of the immense\r\nmess they would be in; how the whole edifice would clatter about their\r\nears. I had a sudden desire to stop the train and go back for a day,\r\nfor two days, to set that negligence right. My brain for a moment\r\nbrightened, became animated and prolific of ideas. I thought of a\r\nbrilliant line we might have taken on that confounded Reformatory\r\nBill....\r\n\r\nThat sort of thing was over....\r\n\r\nWhat indeed wasn't over? I passed to a vaguer, more multitudinous\r\nperception of disaster, the friends I had lost already since Altiora\r\nbegan her campaign, the ampler remnant whom now I must lose. I thought\r\nof people I had been merry with, people I had worked with and played\r\nwith, the companions of talkative walks, the hostesses of houses that\r\nhad once glowed with welcome for us both. I perceived we must lose them\r\nall. I saw life like a tree in late autumn that had once been rich and\r\nsplendid with friends--and now the last brave dears would be hanging on\r\ndoubtfully against the frosty chill of facts, twisting and tortured in\r\nthe universal gale of indignation, trying to evade the cold blast of the\r\ntruth. I had betrayed my party, my intimate friend, my wife, the\r\nwife whose devotion had made me what I was. For awhile the figure of\r\nMargaret, remote, wounded, shamed, dominated my mind, and the thought of\r\nmy immense ingratitude. Damn them! they'd take it out of her too. I had\r\na feeling that I wanted to go straight back and grip some one by the\r\nthroat, some one talking ill of Margaret. They'd blame her for not\r\nkeeping me, for letting things go so far.... I wanted the whole world\r\nto know how fine she was. I saw in imagination the busy, excited\r\ndinner tables at work upon us all, rather pleasantly excited, brightly\r\nindignant, merciless.\r\n\r\nWell, it's the stuff we are!...\r\n\r\nThen suddenly, stabbing me to the heart, came a vision of Margaret's\r\ntears and the sound of her voice saying, “Husband mine! Oh! husband\r\nmine! To see you cry!”...\r\n\r\nI came out of a cloud of thoughts to discover the narrow compartment,\r\nwith its feeble lamp overhead, and our rugs and hand-baggage swaying on\r\nthe rack, and Isabel, very still in front of me, gripping my wilting red\r\nroses tightly in her bare and ringless hand.\r\n\r\nFor a moment I could not understand her attitude, and then I perceived\r\nshe was sitting bent together with her head averted from the light to\r\nhide the tears that were streaming down her face. She had not got her\r\nhandkerchief out for fear that I should see this, but I saw her tears,\r\ndark drops of tears, upon her sleeve....\r\n\r\nI suppose she had been watching my expression, divining my thoughts.\r\n\r\nFor a time I stared at her and was motionless, in a sort of still and\r\nweary amazement. Why had we done this injury to one another? WHY? Then\r\nsomething stirred within me.\r\n\r\n“ISABEL!” I whispered.\r\n\r\nShe made no sign.\r\n\r\n“Isabel!” I repeated, and then crossed over to her and crept closely to\r\nher, put my arm about her, and drew her wet cheek to mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The New Machiavelli, by Herbert George Wells",
