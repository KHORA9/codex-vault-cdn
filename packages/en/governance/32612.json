They\r\nwere not written for publication in book-form; and they naturally suffer,\r\nin their present form, from the conditions that were first imposed on\r\nthem, conditions proper to their original setting. With the exception of\r\ntwo of them, they were written rather in a spirit of exposition than in a\r\nspirit of analysis and criticism; and this intention was only departed\r\nfrom because it seemed that the two matters so dealt with departed, with\r\ndiffering degrees of flagrancy, from the original purpose of the\r\nConstitution, which was to make the mechanism of Government malleable at\r\nevery stage to the will of the people of Ireland.\r\n\r\nWhether one believes ardently in the faith that the will of a people\r\nshould under all circumstances prevail, and that the forms of Government\r\nshould at all times be submissive to that will, is indifferent. That is a\r\nquestion for the individual, with which I do not presume to interfere. One\r\nneed only believe with l'Abbé Coignard that \"a people is not susceptible\r\nto more than one form of government at the same period,\" to believe,\r\nfurther, that if one asserts the derivation of all power and authority\r\nfrom the popular will, if that will be once fairly and honestly\r\nascertained, it then follows that the will of the people is sufficient to\r\nitself, and that all forms of government must be made malleable to it. On\r\nthat supposition, all frustrations and obstructions of, and impediments\r\nto, the constant exercise of that will must of necessity be cogs in the\r\nmachinery of government; and for that reason in two articles I turned from\r\nexposition to criticism.\r\n\r\nApart from these two matters, I held to the essentials of exposition,\r\nwithout turning aside to criticism of details; and I based that exposition\r\non the original plan and structure, which are preserved in the present\r\ndraft, of the Constitution. It is right that the Fundamental Law of a\r\nState should be fully discussed and debated before it be enacted; and when\r\nthat debate occurs criticism will find details enough to fasten upon. But\r\nat the present moment it is the essential plan that matters--not the\r\nfeudal trumperies with which it is adorned, like stage jewels stuck upon a\r\ncomely and decent garment, marring its simple truth, but not otherwise\r\ninjuring its effectiveness for its purpose. And it was because it seemed\r\nto me that these two matters departed from the spirit of this essential\r\nplan, by placing important parts of the Judiciary and the Executive beyond\r\nthe ready control of the people or the people's representatives, that I\r\ndealt with them as I did. Apart from them I kept away from criticism.\r\n\r\nSimilarly I did not deal with certain matters anterior to the\r\nConstitution, in the light of which the Constitution can alone be\r\nunderstood. They lay out of sight of these articles, though they were\r\nessential to them, since they brought the Constitution, in its present\r\nform, into being. Chief among these is the historical fact that Ireland\r\nhas, by Treaty, confirmed by the act of her Legislature, consented to\r\nenter a Community of Nations known at the moment as the British\r\nCommonwealth of Nations. We may disagree with this act; but it is an\r\ninternational fact; and without it the Constitution would not be what it\r\nnow is. This factor in the result is therefore worth brief attention, by\r\nway of introduction to the present publication of these articles.\r\n\r\nTo anyone familiar with the constitutions of the nations that now comprise\r\nthe Commonwealth of Nations the present Constitution will speak in an\r\nunaccustomed language. It is unlike any of them. It has clearly been\r\nplanned as the result of a distinct and separate conception. The causes of\r\nthe difference are, however, not very difficult to discover, and once seen\r\nare plain to understand. They constitute what may prove to be an\r\ninternational factor of the very first importance.\r\n\r\nThese causes fall under, broadly, two heads. The first is that Ireland is\r\nnot what these other nations were when their Constitutions were first\r\nframed. Nor is Ireland, indeed, what they are now. Canada, for example,\r\nand Australia, are English Colonies, first established by white men in a\r\ncoloured population. The greater part of these white men draw their\r\ntraditions and inspiration, their habits of thought and habits of public\r\nconduct, from the rootstock of the English nation. They look to England as\r\ntheir mother-country. But Ireland is an ancient nation and a\r\nmother-country in her own right. She has herself peopled the earth with\r\nher children. Her empire is as far-flung as England's. And if it is not\r\nbased on military might, but linked by ties of memory, pride and love, it\r\nhas not therefore proved itself any the less powerful internationally at\r\ntimes of crisis and danger for the mother at home.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it was she who, when in the eighth and ninth centuries Europe\r\nfell into decay after the barbarian inroads, re-established and rebuilt\r\nEuropean civilisation, sending her scholars with her books into every part\r\nof the continent of ruin. It was her missionaries, indeed, who first\r\nbrought Christianity to England, and her scholars who taught the first\r\nEnglish poet his letters. Before the name of England was heard, the name\r\nof Ireland was known and respected. She possessed an intricate, if\r\nuncompleted national polity when the neighbouring island was peopled by\r\ndistinct and scattered populations of conquerors. By virtue of these\r\nancient dignities she was accorded international rank long after England\r\nhad risen to nationhood, and when invasion had brought her national polity\r\nto ruin and silenced the voice of poet and scholar.\r\n\r\nThese are not matters merely of the past. If they were, they could be\r\ndismissed to the antiquity in which they would lie. But they live in the\r\nconsciousness of a nation to-day; and therefore to-day they are a factor,\r\nto neglect which would be to neglect a prime element without which neither\r\nthe present nor the future may be understood. Only the sentimentalist\r\nwaves out of sight considerations that are unpleasant to him. The realist\r\nfaces every element of being, conscious or unconscious; for he knows that\r\nonly out of the sum of all those elements can life proceed, or creation\r\nbegin.\r\n\r\nFor these ancient dignities have passed into the consciousness of every\r\nsort of Irishmen. It was, for example, Molyneux who, in his _Case of\r\nIreland Stated_ at the end of the 17th century, first among modern Irish\r\nwriters based an argument upon them. Molyneux was an English colonist. In\r\nthe wars of Tirconnell and Patrick Sarsfield he had fled to England,\r\nreturning only when Ginkel the Dutchman had won the field for his master,\r\nnow monarch of England. He regarded the ancient nation with aversion. Yet\r\nwhen the English Parliament harassed what he proudly conceived to be the\r\nancient liberty of Ireland, he stated the case of that nation, stated it\r\nas his case, in a public document of historic moment; and the English\r\nParliament caused his book to be burned by the public hangman.\r\n\r\nThe sorest part of his book was his reference to the Council of Constance\r\nof 1416. This Council may rightly claim to be the first of modern\r\ninternational congresses. At it a certain question of precedence had\r\narisen between France and England, which was referred to the Court of\r\nHeralds. In the judgment which was given it was stated as an international\r\nruling that Europe was first constituted from four nations. These nations,\r\nin the order of their precedence, were Rome, Byzantium, Ireland and Spain.\r\nAnd Molyneux, the English colonist, proudly referred to this ruling, and\r\nbased a great part of his case upon it.\r\n\r\nThe breed of Molyneux is alive to-day. Political differences have divided\r\nit from the ancient race which furnished its arguments. But the pride is\r\nthe same; the sense of possession is essentially the same, obscured though\r\nit may have been by the causes of difference; and when a new alignment of\r\npolitical parties has blent the two points of view into one outlook, and\r\nmade the whole consciousness to merge in one, the living factor of ancient\r\nnationhood will arise with a new strength.\r\n\r\nThat strength will prove a factor for the future. The cause of it is\r\nregistered in the present draft Constitution; and it is the first of the\r\ntwo causes that make it unlike those of the other nations with which\r\nIreland is now confederate and co-equal. The second cause is curiously\r\nlike, and yet curiously unlike, to the first. It is also derived from the\r\nfact of nationhood, but from the achievement of nationhood at the other\r\nend of history.\r\n\r\nFor the other nations of the Commonwealth are themselves not now what they\r\nwere when their constitutions were first framed. They were then but\r\ncolonies, on whom their mother-country was pleased to bestow\r\nconstitutions--and if the pleasure was not always the most noticeable part\r\nof the bestowal, the legal smile did not diminish the fact of the gift. In\r\ntheir constitutions, therefore, the apron-strings are very much in\r\nevidence. It is clear from them that the mother did not propose to let the\r\nchildren wander far from her control, even though she permitted them to\r\nwalk with their own feet. Not only in the actual provisions of these\r\nconstitutions, but in their very conception and plan, drawn exactly\r\naccording to English methods and from English experience, it is evident\r\nthat a state of perpetual tutelage was imagined for the peoples to whom\r\nthey were given.\r\n\r\nThat has now changed. The colonies have come to be nations, very jealous\r\nof their nationhood. They have grown with experience, have moved onward\r\nwith time, and it would go hard with anyone who attempted to remind them\r\nof what, nevertheless, their constitutions are a continual reminder. The\r\nconsequence is that the provisions of these constitutions cannot be\r\nenforced since they do not square with experience. They encumber the\r\ndocuments which contain them as so much dead timber. They are sometimes\r\ncarelessly, and more often dishonestly, described as legal fictions. But\r\nthey are not legal fictions. They are dead letters--dead timber which a\r\nwise woodman would soon hew away. Life and experience have outgrown them;\r\nand this growth finds expression--if, unfortunately, not the full\r\nexpression that might at one time have seemed possible--in the present\r\ndraft Constitution. For under her Treaty with England Ireland agreed to\r\ntake equal rank in the Community of Nations with the other members of it.\r\nSpecifically she accepted the \"law, practice and constitutional usage\" of\r\nCanada; and that constitutional usage implies, not the dead timber of the\r\nCanadian Constitution, but the living tissue of her constitutional\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nThese two causes, then, have joined together to produce the draft of the\r\nIrish Constitution. From them was created the original plan of the\r\nConstitution, according to which Ireland takes her place, not only\r\ngenerally among all nations in virtue of her ancient right, but specially\r\nin a certain confederacy of nations in virtue of a Treaty of Peace, signed\r\nbetween her plenipotentiaries and England's plenipotentiaries, and\r\napproved by both legislatures. To the most casual glance, it is indeed a\r\nmost modern and forward-looking document; yet it draws from so ancient a\r\nfountain-head. And the conjunction of these two may prove of searching\r\nvalue, if rightly used, to Ireland's influence in the world--provided that\r\nthere be peace at home, without which a nation is nought. That influence\r\nmay not be of the same kind as one had hoped before the Treaty of Peace\r\nwas signed. But even if it be not of the same kind, its measure need not\r\nbe less. It cannot be so immediate; and that is loss; but it may with\r\nwisdom and firmness prove ultimately to be more extensive. Whatever the\r\nmeans, the end remains the same; and that end is the contribution in the\r\ncomity of nations of the fruits of personality--without which neither men\r\nnor nations can plead a justification for life.\r\n\r\nFor when a nation such as Ireland joins a confederacy so composed, she by\r\nthe mere fact of her addition transfigures the whole. This is not a\r\nfanciful figure of speech. It is a literal description of what has already\r\noccurred. In the case of no other nation of the Community, for example,\r\nhas its advent been signalled by an International Treaty. That, in itself,\r\nis a transfiguration of the whole. Similarly, other nations of the\r\nCommunity had protested the co-equality of each and all; but the\r\nprotestation had remained a protestation until it was formally declared\r\nfor each and all by the claim made by and recognised for Ireland.\r\n\r\nSo it has proved in the very case of this Constitution. The full height of\r\nnationhood is the recognition of sovereignty; and the completest act of\r\nsovereignty of which a nation may be capable is to confer its Constitution\r\non itself. With the exception of Great Britain, none of the other members\r\nof the Community were, when their constitutions were enacted, capable of\r\nthis. Each of them received its Constitution as bestowed, not by the Act\r\nof its own Legislature, but by the Act of a suzerain Legislature. And that\r\nshortness of national stature remained until it was removed by the\r\naddition of Ireland to the Community. For Ireland will receive her\r\nConstitution by the Act of her own Constituent Assembly, not by the Act of\r\nany suzerain Legislature. Whether the Constitution be or be not adopted by\r\nany other assembly neither gives nor detracts from the national authority\r\nit will possess. If it be so adopted, it will be adopted, not as giving it\r\nauthority, but as the completing Act of ratifying the Treaty. That is to\r\nsay, it will be adopted by the Parliament of Great Britain as concluding\r\nthe interest of that Parliament in the international bargain of the\r\nTreaty; and it will be passed and prescribed by the Irish Assembly as\r\ngiving it full force and effect in Ireland. And that is a full sovereign\r\nact. But, since all the members of the Community are declared to be\r\nco-equal, the advent of Ireland, therefore, has given the recognition of\r\nsovereignty to them all, and raised each to the full height of nationhood.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of this are at the moment difficult to foresee fully; but\r\nthey are consequences that the addition of Ireland to the Community has\r\ncreated, though in the fullness of time they were ready for her advent. It\r\nis certain that they will reach far and strike deep, not only within the\r\nCommunity, but towards other nations, not members of the Community.\r\nAlready as between the six full members of the Community the thought of\r\nEmpire belongs to the past; and the word and feudal trappings will follow\r\nthe thought. Indeed, though the foolish trappings remain, in the text of\r\nboth the Treaty and the Constitution the word has already begun to be\r\nsupplanted by the word Community. And though it be true that words are\r\nonly words, it is equally true that words are the parasites of thought,\r\nand cling to the mind long after their original uses are forgotten. To\r\ncause the relinquishment of an ancient word is itself a liberal\r\naccomplishment of no mean sort, as psychologists know; and none can say\r\nwhere new conceptions will not lead when once the barrier of words has\r\nbeen broken down.\r\n\r\nThese are, however, considerations for the future; and the future is only\r\nfor those who are worthy of it--and not always even for such. Already a\r\nconsiderable change has been wrought; and that change is registered with\r\nall its faults in the present draft Constitution. The nation that caused\r\nthe change is the same nation still, in spite of sad scattering of its\r\nnational strength. It is still an ancient nation: not a colony: never a\r\ncolony: deeply conscious of its historic heirlooms and prescriptive\r\ndignities. Ireland is still a mother-country, fully resolved to employ her\r\nempire of memory and love for the purposes which she and it judge worthy.\r\nHer place and power in the Community will prove to be of no mean degree,\r\nand of no small meaning for the nations outside that Community, as well\r\nfor the peoples and nations within it, if she rally her strength around\r\nher and prove worthy of her destiny. When she shall have conferred a\r\nConstitution upon herself, within the limits of her contractual obligation\r\nin the Treaty, she will not have foresworn her heritage (unless she elect\r\nto do so); she will not have diminished her strength (unless she choose to\r\ndissipate it); but she will be able by a persistent purpose, of which she\r\nhas already given her pledges, to contribute in the future as she\r\ncontributed in the past, with a security that has not been allowed her for\r\nmany centuries, to the benefit of nations. And it is to this end I\r\ndedicate this little book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Irish Constitution\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nWHAT IS A CONSTITUTION?\r\n\r\nDuring the early days of the second French Republic a customer entered a\r\nbookseller's and asked: \"Have you a copy of the French Constitution?\" \"We\r\ndo not,\" the bookseller politely replied, \"deal in periodical literature.\"\r\n\r\nNow, to any student of history such a story is a sure indication of the\r\ntime of which it is told. He need not inquire to know that the time was\r\none of revolution, change, and unsettlement. He also knows the mind of the\r\npeople of that time, for insecure conditions beget a nervous, restless\r\nfear. And these things are significant. They reveal a quality of\r\nconstitution-making that is not always, or easily, remembered. For\r\nwhatever changes may proceed in legislation--however many and rapid they\r\nbe--as long as the Constitution, written or unwritten, remains intact, the\r\nState at least is stable and its foundations are secure.\r\n\r\nPlainly, therefore, nothing should be written into a Constitution that is\r\nof a temporary, experimental, or questionable nature, or which should fall\r\nto the lot of ordinary law-making and the changing convenience of\r\npractice. A Constitution is that which is permanent, as far as anything in\r\nthis world may be permanent. Even to amend it, or add to it, requires in\r\nall countries (except England, where the Constitution has not taken a\r\nwritten form) a procedure quite different from that of ordinary\r\nlegislation. To change it, or recast it, requires a revolution. Such a\r\nrevolution may not be accompanied by bloodshedding, or it may, but it is\r\ncertainly accompanied by insecurity and unsettlement.\r\n\r\nIt should, therefore, be the business of constitution-makers to prescribe\r\nonly what to them is fundamental and irrefutable; to lay down the secure\r\nfoundations of their State; and to leave all other matters to the\r\nexperience of the nation, without seeking to shackle that experience by\r\nprovisions that time may not commend. Otherwise, a convulsion may be\r\nnecessary to get done what ordinary legislation could have accomplished\r\nwithout affecting the stability of the State.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the first definition of a Constitution, that it contains\r\nthe Fundamental Law of a State, and only the Fundamental Law. In England\r\nthere is no such thing as a Fundamental Law. It is claimed by English\r\nconstitutional lawyers that this is because Parliament is sovereign; but\r\nthe historical truth is that in England Parliament exercises a sovereignty\r\nin fact which the King is supposed to exercise in theory; and any attempt\r\nto make the theory square with the fact by the writing of a Fundamental\r\nLaw would lead, perhaps, to a surprising situation.\r\n\r\nYet in England certain fundamental rights are recognised, with which\r\nParliament would not lightly tamper; and these amount in effect to a\r\nFundamental Law, holding a higher rank than ordinary laws. In practically\r\nall other countries such rights are set forth in a document, different\r\nfrom all other legal documents, inasmuch as unless these other documents\r\nobserve the conditions required in the first, and do not conflict with its\r\nprovisions, they are null and void. In both sets of documents the laws of\r\nthe realm are to be found; but the two sets of laws are of different\r\nsorts. One is fundamental and permanent; the other is by contrast casual\r\nand changeable.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the second definition of a Constitution, not only that it\r\ncontains the fundamental law of a State, but that it prescribes the manner\r\nin which all other laws must be made, and put limits and restrictions on\r\nall other law-making. In the American phrase, it is a \"Frame of\r\nGovernment.\"\r\n\r\nIn English the words Constitution and Legislation do not carry on their\r\nface the relation of one to the other, and the distinction between them.\r\nIn Irish the case is different. In Irish the word for Legislation is\r\n_Reacht_, and the word for Constitution is _Bunreacht_--fixed and\r\nfoundation legislation. But even the distinction so simply carried on the\r\nface of these words does not complete the relation of one to the other.\r\nFor that relation is precise; and consists in the fact that all laws\r\ncomprising the _Reacht_ must be built upon the foundation of the\r\n_Bunreacht_, and must be contained within the fixed limits of the\r\n_Bunreacht_. The moment they attempt to build elsewhere, or go outside\r\nthose limits, that moment they cease to be binding on any citizen; and all\r\ncitizens may claim the protection of the courts of law against them.\r\n\r\nFrom this follows the third definition of a Constitution, which is that it\r\ncontains the highest and completest sovereign act of a nation. A nation\r\nmay confer a Constitution on itself, and that Constitution may contain no\r\ndeclaration that the people are sovereign; but the fact that the nation\r\ndid so make their own Constitution is itself a declaration of sovereignty.\r\nDeclarations of sovereignty in the body of a Constitution may be very\r\nwise; and they are always pleasant; but they are not necessary.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, a nation may make a Constitution for itself, and in that\r\nConstitution confer the chief executive authority on a person to be known\r\nas a king; and that person may be known in name as a sovereign; but the\r\nfact that he derives his power from the Constitution is evidence that, not\r\nhe, but the people, are sovereign. His is only a sovereign name; theirs is\r\nthe sovereign reality.\r\n\r\nSuch Constitutions were made in 1814 by Norway, in 1830 by Belgium, and\r\nonly last year by \"Jugo-Slavia.\" In the last case the kingly line already\r\nexisted before the Constitution was framed, and an oath was prescribed in\r\nit, according to which the King swore \"to maintain the Constitution\r\nintact.\" In the first two cases the kingly lines were not chosen until the\r\nConstitutions had been framed, when the chosen dynasties stepped into the\r\nplaces appointed for them, and carried out the functions defined for them.\r\nIn each case, however, the authority of the king sprang, not from the\r\ndivine right of kings, but from the divine right of the people, as set\r\nforth in the sovereign act of giving themselves a Constitution.\r\n\r\nHow different the power of kings such as these from the power of the\r\nFrench monarch who in the 18th century declared, \"L'Etat, c'est moi\"--\"I\r\nam the State.\" He was right. He was sovereign. Sovereignty had to reside\r\nsomewhere; and until the people arose and declared that it resided in\r\nthem, and expressed that declaration in a formal Constitution, it\r\ncontinued to reside in the ruler who claimed it.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, in 1787, the thirteen American States \"ordained and\r\nestablished a Constitution\" for their Union, then in the modern world the\r\npeople came by their own. France quickly followed the example, but as a\r\nresult of the wars which followed the world was thrown back into reaction.\r\nThroughout the 19th century, however, the statement of democratic\r\nsovereignty as a fundamental law of the State found expression in\r\nConstitution after Constitution; with the result that now, in modern\r\npractice, the existence of a Constitution is practically identical with a\r\nstatement of national sovereignty.\r\n\r\nThere has hitherto been one chief exception; and that exception is of\r\nstriking interest at the present time. For within the British Empire the\r\ntheory has been that there is only one sovereign assembly, the Parliament\r\nat Westminster. It is true that the Constitutions of Canada, Australia and\r\nSouth Africa were each drawn up by Constituent Conventions in the\r\ncountries themselves; but by the prevalent theory none of these peoples\r\nwere competent to confer these Constitutions upon themselves. They were\r\nnot, that is to say, sovereign; and before the Constitutions they devised\r\ntherefore could come of effect they had to be passed as Imperial Acts by\r\nthe Parliament at Westminster.\r\n\r\nYet that also has now changed. Ireland has wrought the change; and the\r\ndeep influence of that change cannot be foretold. For the Dail elected to\r\npass the Constitution will act, not as a Constituent Convention, but as a\r\nConstituent Assembly. It will not only devise the Constitution, with the\r\npresent Constitution before it as a Bill for discussion, but, having\r\ndevised it, will prescribe it; and thus, through their elected\r\nrepresentatives, the people of Ireland will have conferred it on\r\nthemselves as their Fundamental Law.\r\n\r\nThat is a sovereign act; and that act will differ in no degree from a\r\nsimilar act by any other sovereign people. From this, however, one last\r\nconsideration follows; and, though it is simple, it is not usually\r\nremembered. For if the passing of a Constitution is an act of full\r\nsovereignty, and if that Constitution, being a Fundamental Law, restricts\r\nand limits all future law-making, then the assemblies to come which will\r\npass those future laws will not be sovereign.\r\n\r\nThey will not be able to do what they will, and they will not be able to\r\nact as they will, for they must obey the requirements and act within the\r\nlimits of the Constitution, as prescribed by the first Assembly, which\r\nalone was of full sovereignty. For this reason every nation has gone to\r\ngreat care to choose persons of special competence for the body which is\r\nto act as a Constituent Assembly--the body, indeed, which is to act as the\r\nfirst, and, so long as that Constitution shall remain, the last Sovereign\r\nAssembly of the nation. The act of prescribing a Constitution being the\r\nhighest act that a nation can make, care has always been taken to make it\r\nthe fullest and the freest. For, once done, it cannot be undone, except at\r\ngreat trouble, and perhaps as the result of great convulsion.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nTHE PLAN OF THE CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\nTo draw up a plan is almost inevitably to express a philosophy. In shaping\r\nthe sequence and proportion of the parts which are to comprise the whole,\r\nthe trick of the mind will out; and it is in that trick of the mind that,\r\nultimately, all philosophies are contained. Perhaps there are few who,\r\nafter consideration, would deny this in all the ordinary (greater or\r\nlesser) concerns of life; but many will think it strange in a matter so\r\ndry as the drafting of a Constitution. Yet even in the drafting of a\r\nConstitution it will be found equally true.\r\n\r\nA Constitution may be likened to a pyramid, the apex of which is the\r\nExecutive Authority, and the base the People. The first question that\r\ntherefore at once arises is, where shall one begin first with this\r\npyramid? But before this question can be answered, another must first be\r\nmet; and it is, whether the base is hung from the apex, or whether the\r\napex rests on the base? What relation has the Executive Authority (whether\r\nkingly, presidential or consular) to the People, and the People to the\r\nExecutive Authority; and which, names and titles apart, is ultimately the\r\nSovereign? These are ripe questions; and only in the making of the plan\r\ncan they be answered.\r\n\r\nI have already shewn that the writing of a Constitution is itself evidence\r\nthat the people are sovereign, even though no statement to that effect is\r\nincluded in the writing. But when one comes to look in the Constitutions\r\nof the world it is curious to note the persistence with which that truth\r\nis overlooked. The Canadian Constitution, for example, having provided for\r\nthe Union of Provinces by which the Federation was created, begins at once\r\nwith the statement that \"the Executive Government and authority of and\r\nover Canada is hereby declared to continue and be vested in the Queen.\"\r\nNothing has been said about a Legislature--nothing about the people of\r\nCanada. The Constitution begins at once with an Executive Authority which\r\nnothing has brought into being, and which therefore exists of its own\r\nright, original and indefeasible, all things else in the Constitution\r\ndepending from it. The pyramid is hung from heaven, for the philosophy of\r\nthe plan is to be found in the mediaeval myth of the Divine Right of\r\nKings.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of Canada consequently proceeds downwards from that apex\r\nto the Legislature; and in that Legislature, according to the philosophy,\r\nthe Senate comes before the Commons. \"There shall,\" it says, \"be one\r\nParliament for Canada, consisting of the Queen, an Upper House, styled the\r\nSenate, and the House of Commons.\" As for the base, it is found nowhere at\r\nall. The interest is exhausted before it is reached; and the People are\r\nnot mentioned.\r\n\r\nI have taken the Canadian Constitution because it is specially mentioned\r\nin the present draft of the Constitution of _Saorstat Eireann_; but the\r\nsame supposition is found in many other constitutions, such as those of\r\nDenmark, Sweden, South Africa. In them are to be found the relics of the\r\nmediaeval theory of government, of a divine authority conferred on a\r\nfamily, which therefore ruled of its own right; and of its own grace\r\nsummoned the subjects of that authority for counsel and advice. Therefore\r\nin these constitutions it is assumed that the sovereignty is above and the\r\nsubjection below--even though no one to-day supposes that the practical\r\nfacts are what they assume them to be.\r\n\r\nIn the Irish Constitution, as in most modern constitutions, this order is\r\ninverted. The sovereignty is below, and the subjection is above. Never\r\nonce throughout the Irish Constitution (either in its original or its\r\npresent form) are the people once considered as subjects, but always as\r\nsovereign citizens. The pyramid is based on the broad earth, in the divine\r\nright of the people; and a beginning is therefore made with the base,\r\nproceeding upward to the apex. The plan in fact is reversed because the\r\nphilosophy is different.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of _Saorstat Eireann_ begins with the people, and with a\r\nstatement of the sovereignty of the people. \"All powers of Government,\" it\r\nsays in Article 2, \"and all authority, legislative, executive and\r\njudicial, are derived from the people and the same shall be exercised in\r\n_Saorstat Eireann_ through the organisations established by or under, and\r\nin accord with, this Constitution.\" In this Constitution, therefore, the\r\npeople of Ireland establish their own right, original and indefeasible,\r\nand all things and persons and institutions named or created by or under\r\nit depend from them. That is in the present, as it was in the original,\r\ndraft. Whatever institution or organisation is established to act on their\r\nbehalf, acts under an authority conferred by them; and in accord with the\r\nspecific bestowal of that authority; and not otherwise. Whatever person or\r\npower is named, is named to act on their behalf; acts under the same\r\nauthority; in accord with the specific bestowal of that authority; and not\r\notherwise. The people confer of their own right; and what they may confer\r\nthey may withdraw. If the authority they confer be abused or transgressed,\r\nit ceases thereupon to have any sanction or reverence, and possesses no\r\nbinding effect. That is to say, in the terms of my figure, the apex of the\r\npyramid rests on the base, is hung from no mythical divine right of kings,\r\nand has no support outside the people of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe people, consequently, are citizens of a free state, not the subjects\r\nof authority. It is necessary, therefore, at once to state who are the\r\ncitizens of this state, and what constitutes their citizenship. This the\r\nnext article proceeds to define. In this article the whole question of\r\nfuture citizenship is referred to legislation. It properly belongs to\r\nlegislation, since it includes a number of complex matters and details\r\nquite unsuited to a Constitution. Yet there must be an original\r\ncitizenship, otherwise the service of the state could not begin. Article\r\n3, therefore, states what constitutes the original citizenship of Saorstat\r\nEireann; and leaves all matters \"governing the future acquisition and\r\ntermination of citizenship\" to be \"determined by law,\" making it a\r\nconstitutional provision, however, that \"men and women have equal rights\r\nas citizens.\" And Article 4 provides that the official language of that\r\ncitizenship shall be the Irish language.\r\n\r\nFrom these original citizens, and from whomever shall be admitted to\r\ncitizenship in the future, all the authority of the State derives under\r\nthe Constitution. They are the base of the pyramid, and it is they who in\r\nthe Constitution (according to the plan on which it is framed) confer on\r\ncertain persons and organisations definite powers of Government in\r\nIreland. But the authority which can confer, can also withhold; and from\r\nthe powers which they grant, certain matters are withheld. For there are\r\nmatters which comprise the fundamental rights of their sovereignty, with\r\nwhich no Government created by them can interfere. If the Government had\r\nexisted, or had claimed to have existed, of its own original right, it\r\ncould, being itself sovereign, have acted as it pleased; and in past times\r\nit did so. But since Government under the Constitution exists only by\r\nreason of an authority conferred by a sovereign people, these Fundamental\r\nRights of their sovereignty are kept apart; and no authority--legislative,\r\nexecutive or judicial--and no power of Government is conceded the right to\r\ntouch them.\r\n\r\nTherefore in the first section of the Constitution, where the original\r\nauthority of the people is stated, certain matters are withheld. They are\r\ndescribed as _Fundamental Rights_. The liberty of the Person, the\r\nInviolability of the Dwelling, Freedom of Conscience and the Free Practice\r\nand Profession of Religion, the Free Expression of Opinion, Free\r\nAssembly, Free Association, Free Elementary Education, and the\r\nInalienability of Natural Resources, are each dealt with in successive\r\narticles as forming the essentials of these rights. Before any powers are\r\nconferred, before any organisations or institutions of Government are\r\ncreated, these matters are put to one side and reserved. They belong to\r\nthe people. None shall interfere with them. The people are sovereign, and\r\nthey so decide.\r\n\r\nSuch is the plan, for such is the philosophy. The first section of the\r\nConstitution, therefore, includes what may be described as the base of the\r\npyramid, resting on the soil of Ireland and established in the right of\r\nthe People of Ireland. From that base the pyramid is built up toward the\r\nExecutive Authority, in section by section, giving the logical order in\r\nwhich power is derived. Each section is based on that which precedes it;\r\nfor the order is the same as in the original draft, and therefore the plan\r\nis preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nTHE MAKING OF LAWS.\r\n\r\nAll powers of Government may derive from the people, but the people cannot\r\nof themselves govern themselves. In simple small communities the people\r\nmay gather together and frame the manner of their government from meeting\r\nto meeting (and only then when ancient custom has given them the practice\r\nand expectation of such assemblies); but among nations for a people to\r\ndiscipline and rule themselves it is necessary that they bestow recognised\r\nand definite powers of government on representatives of their choice. Such\r\nrepresentatives, to be sure, have a habit of conceiving that they are\r\nrulers of their own right. Cases have even been known where they have\r\nendeavoured to obstruct the right of the people to depose them. But the\r\ntruth is that such representatives are merely a convenience. They are a\r\npeople's instruments, and no more. Without them the achievement of a\r\ncommon agreement, and the formulation of laws based on that common\r\nagreement, would prove so cumbersome as to be impossible. A people must\r\ntherefore tolerate them with good humour; and keep them under proper\r\ncontrol. And when such representatives have been chosen, they together\r\nform an organised body for the making of laws, and for the supervision and\r\ncontrol of the execution of such laws.\r\n\r\nObviously, then, once a Constitution has stated the sovereign source of\r\nall authority, and defined the fundamental rights of that sovereignty, it\r\nis essential that it should prescribe the manner in which laws shall be\r\nmade for the peace, order and good government of the whole people. The\r\nsecond section of the Constitution, therefore, deals with the _Legislative\r\nProvisions_ of the State. The most important of these, manifestly, is the\r\ncreation of an organisation of representatives; but, owing to the tendency\r\nof representatives to arrogate powers to themselves, of late years the\r\npeoples of many States have insisted on a direct voice in the checking,\r\nand even in the making, of laws. This direct voice has been exerted by\r\nmeans of two instruments known generally as the Referendum and the\r\nInitiative. Wherever these prevail, the Assembly of Representatives is\r\ngiven only a limited power in the making of laws, the sovereign authority\r\nreserving to itself a constant and continuous control over its action. And\r\nin our Constitution both these instruments are given a place. For it is a\r\nsound rule that the people are generally better than their\r\nrepresentatives--wiser of counsel, more disinterested of judgment--and it\r\nis therefore provided in the Constitution that there shall be an Assembly\r\nof Representatives, but that the people may require of that Assembly that\r\nlaws be referred to them for final decision, or that laws be made to suit\r\ntheir desire.\r\n\r\nThe most important part of these legislative provisions, however, is the\r\nsetting up of a National Assembly, or Synod, to be known as the\r\nOireachtas. This is to be formed of two Houses, Dail Eireann and Seanad\r\nEireann. There are many powerful arguments against the two-chamber system.\r\nIn the end they all resolve themselves into a question of ultimate\r\nresponsibility. In a simple illustration, if there be one thimble and one\r\npea, it is easy enough to know where the pea is. But directly a second\r\nthimble is brought up beside the first, the difficulty of placing the pea\r\nbecomes at once a problem. On the other hand, the arguments in favour of a\r\nsecond-chamber system also resolve themselves into a question of\r\nresponsibility. For if there is only one chamber, without a second to\r\ncheck it and act together with it, there is, it is argued, a greater\r\nlikelihood of its acting in an irresponsible manner, and of its running\r\ninto hasty, ill-advised legislation. Its members, having acquired the\r\nhabit of concerted action, may moreover strike a bargain behind the\r\npeople's back, even while preserving all the forms of opposition and\r\ndiscussion. With the two instruments of the Referendum and the Initiative\r\nin operation this danger is less likely, provided that the people be\r\nsufficiently alert. Yet it exists. In most countries, therefore, two\r\nchambers are the rule; and in our Constitution it is provided that there\r\nshall be two chambers, care being taken to fix responsibility ultimately\r\nin the first in case of doubt or delay.\r\n\r\nGiven two chambers, the difficulty is the creation of the Second Chamber.\r\nThe First Chamber causes little difficulty, and is mainly a matter, not\r\nfor the Constitution, but for an Electoral Law. The Second Chamber is a\r\nmatter for the Constitution. Indeed, the question and creation of a Second\r\nChamber, and the formation of the Executive Power, are the two foremost\r\nproblems for the making of every Constitution. The first difficulty is to\r\nfind for the Second Chamber a sufficient constituency, and the second\r\ndifficulty is to find for it a proper function; and both these problems\r\nare essentially matters for the Constitution of a State. To answer both of\r\nthem satisfactorily is the difficulty; and an examination of the\r\nconstitutions of other countries reveals that in few cases have they been\r\nanswered even to general satisfaction.\r\n\r\nAs for the constituency, it is clear that this cannot be the same as for\r\nthe first chamber, otherwise the two Houses are simply repetitions. That\r\nis one consideration to be remembered. There is another. For from earliest\r\ntimes mankind has desired to call into its special councils those who have\r\ndistinguished themselves in the conduct of its affairs. Folk may disagree\r\nwith such persons, but they defer to them and hear them. What may be\r\ncalled the Senatorial Person is a recognised factor in the history of all\r\nnations. In the push and jostle of entry to the First House--where special\r\nand local interests are represented--such a Senatorial Person is most\r\nlikely to be thrust aside, even if he or she be inclined to mingle in the\r\nfray. He is consequently lost to the councils of the nation. How shall a\r\nplace be found for him or for her; and when the place is found, what shall\r\nbe the measure of his or her counsel?\r\n\r\nOther nations have answered these problems in divers ways. None has\r\nanswered them as they are answered in the Constitution of _Saorstat\r\nEireann_. For it is clear that if there is to be a Second Chamber, the\r\nright place for such a Senatorial Person is in that Second Chamber, since\r\nonly thus is it possible to avoid making one chamber a mere copy of the\r\nother. In some countries, therefore, the Second Chamber is composed of\r\npersons on whom a title has been conferred--and on their children who\r\nsucceed to that title. In other countries the Second Chamber is created by\r\nnomination--with at least the ostensible wish that only Senatorial Persons\r\nwill be appointed. Both these methods have led to corruption. Both,\r\nmoreover, have led to one fatal fault. For Second Chambers are mainly of\r\nvalue at times when the First Chamber is likely to rush to a mistake; and\r\nat such times no people are inclined to give careful heed to the counsel\r\nof persons whom they have not themselves chosen to give that counsel. They\r\nmay be exactly such persons as they themselves would have chosen; but the\r\nfact that they did not choose them, the fact that they came there by the\r\naccident of birth, or the power of money, robs them of authority just when\r\ntheir authority is most required.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, the people's own choice of Senators is necessary to their\r\nefficiency and authority. In countries formed out of a Confederation this\r\ndifficulty is evaded by the creation of the Senate from the Federated\r\nStates, while creating the First Chamber directly from the whole people.\r\nBut where there are no Federated States the people's direct bestowal of\r\nauthority cannot be evaded if friction and loss of strength are to be\r\navoided. Thus one returns to the original problem, which is, how the\r\npeople shall choose a Senate which will not be a copy of the Chamber of\r\nDeputies, and how the Senatorial Person will find his way to the councils\r\nof the nation, bringing with him an unanswerable authority.\r\n\r\nOur Constitution meets this by making the whole country one constituency\r\nfor the election of the Senate. The Deputies are elected from localities\r\nwhere they are known, and the special interests of which they are\r\nqualified to represent. Over those interests the major interest of the\r\nwhole nation stands guard. It would be possible for persons to enter the\r\nChamber of Deputies who are not known outside their own localities, but\r\nwho are qualified to represent those localities. But by making the entire\r\ncountry one constituency for the election of the Senate, no merely local\r\ninterest will have power to secure election. And thus it will be possible\r\nto find a place for the Senatorial Person from, as the Constitution reads,\r\n\"citizens who have done honour to the nation by reason of useful public\r\nservice, or who, because of special qualifications or attainments,\r\nrepresent important aspects of the nation's life.\" These persons are to be\r\nelected by Proportional Representation; and in order that the business of\r\nelection shall not prove too cumbersome it is appointed that one-fourth of\r\nthe Senate shall retire every three years, and that before each election a\r\nlist shall be prepared by both Houses consisting of at least three times\r\nas many persons as there are vacancies to be filled.\r\n\r\nSuch form the two Houses of the Oireachtas. Their relation to one another\r\nis carefully defined. The Seanad is created as an advisory and delaying\r\nbody, and the ultimate responsibility is given to the Dail. But endowed,\r\nas it is, with so strong an authority, vested in it by the entire nation\r\nvoting as a whole, it is unlikely that its criticisms and advice can be\r\nneglected. For such criticisms will be furnished in the course of debates\r\nthat will be read by the whole people; and behind them there will always\r\nbe the possibility of appeal to the whole nation by Referendum, which the\r\nSenate can compel by a three-fifths vote. The Senate and the people,\r\ntherefore, are placed in a watchful alliance over the acts and\r\nproceedings of the Dail. Indeed, it is not unlikely that in the future the\r\nSenate and the people (by Referendum) will often be found in practical\r\nalliance against any attempt of the Dail to arrogate power to itself. The\r\nSenate has the power to make it so--a power of greater worth to it, and to\r\nthe nation, than any constitutional right arbitrarily to obstruct\r\nlegislation or to make legislation abortive.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nTHE PEOPLE AS LAW-MAKERS.\r\n\r\nMore is spoken of the two instruments of the Referendum and the Initiative\r\n(particularly the former) than is known about them; for in the countries\r\nwhere they have been adopted, folk use them and do not talk about them,\r\nand where they have not been adopted folk talk about them with ardour or\r\nwith fear but without knowledge. Briefly they may be described as a\r\nretention by the sovereign people of sovereign authority over the making\r\nof laws.\r\n\r\nThe case is not without an historical parallel. In earlier times in other\r\nstates the sovereign was the king, who said, \"L'Etat, c'est moi.\" He was\r\ntherefore the law-maker, by supreme right. He might summon the estates of\r\nhis realm--Lords and Commons--to advise and counsel him; and he might,\r\nnormally, allow their acts without his interference; but, being sovereign,\r\nhe reserved the right to cause those acts to be referred to him for the\r\nfinal act of his will; and he at all times reserved the right to send a\r\nmessage to them instructing them to make laws on matters that seemed to\r\nhim to require attention. This he did, being the sovereign. His parliament\r\nwas the legislature of the State, but he preserved the Referendum and the\r\nInitiative, and held them as his sovereign authority over the authority\r\ndeputed to the legislature.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, sovereignty passed to the people, they assumed the\r\nattributes and the functions of that sovereignty. Where once the king's\r\nperson and the king's dwelling, for example, had been declared to be\r\ninviolable, now (as in our Constitution) the people's persons and the\r\npeople's dwellings are declared to be inviolable. And where once the king\r\nreserved the right to veto and to initiate legislation, so now (as again\r\nin our Constitution) the people reserve the right to veto and to initiate\r\nlegislation. And this is the plain and simple meaning of the two\r\ninstruments of the Referendum and the Initiative. Their effect is to shift\r\nsovereignty from the parliament to the people, where the revolutions of\r\nthe 17th and 18th centuries shifted sovereignty from the king to the\r\nparliament.\r\n\r\nIt frequently happens that theories (for whatever they may be worth) are\r\ncarried to their logical ends by practical people and not by\r\ntheorists--for theory generally lags in the rear of practice. So it\r\nhappened in this case. For it was the soberly practical and conservative\r\npeople of Switzerland who in modern times first devised the Referendum,\r\nand then the Initiative. Since then they have been adopted in many\r\ncountries, chief of which are Belgium, Australia, and many of the American\r\nStates; and they appear in most of the constitutions recently adopted in\r\nEurope. But it is in Switzerland that they can most usefully be studied,\r\nfor there they have a solid experience of ninety years continuous practice\r\nbehind them.\r\n\r\nThe Referendum came first; and in its modern form was first adopted in the\r\nConstitution of the canton of St. Gall in 1831, the second and third\r\narticles of which read:\r\n\r\n     Art. 2.--The people of the canton are sovereign. Sovereignty, which\r\n     is the sum of all political powers, resides in the whole body of\r\n     citizens.\r\n\r\n     Art. 3.--It results from this that the people themselves exercise the\r\n     legislative powers, and every law is submitted to their sanction.\r\n     This sanction is the right of the people to refuse to recognise any\r\n     law submitted to them, and to prevent its execution in virtue of\r\n     their sovereign power.\r\n\r\nFrom St. Gall it spread to each of the other twenty-two cantons, and to\r\nthe legislation reserved to the Federal Assembly. Everywhere it is either\r\ncompulsory for every law to be submitted to the people by Referendum, or\r\nfor laws to be submitted when a given number of electors, within a limited\r\nperiod of time, have demanded that the Referendum be exercised, some of\r\nthe cantons having adopted it in one form and some in another, the\r\nConfederation adopting it in the optional rather than in the obligatory\r\nform. Then, after the Referendum, followed the Initiative with quick pace,\r\nby which the people asserted the right, not merely that laws may be\r\nsubmitted to them for their approval or rejection, but that a given number\r\nof electors (in writing) may demand that the Legislature proceed without\r\ndelay to legislate on any matter that they judge to be of sufficient\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nAt first sight measures such as these appear to be revolutionary and\r\ndrastic. In practice they have proved to be conservative. The mere\r\nexistence of the Referendum has proved to be a check on legislation that\r\nmight otherwise have been carried by parliamentary manoeuvring for\r\nvotes. The people, in actual fact, have proved to be both purer and more\r\nconservative than their representatives; and the tendency towards economy\r\nin the expenditure of public moneys has, in the main, been not the least\r\nbenefit it has conferred. People are little inclined to study bills\r\ndebated in the national assembly when they realise that they are powerless\r\nto change or check the measures it may pass. The power to throw out their\r\nrepresentatives at the next general election is only a limited form of\r\nfreedom, and it is illusory in face of the fact that those representatives\r\nare generally chosen by powerful political organisations which take care\r\nto select pliant and obedient tools. Only at times of great crisis does\r\nthe wish of the people become vocal; and even then it is more usually\r\nneglected than not. But with the Referendum in their hands (especially\r\nwith the Initiative added to it) the will of the people is always present.\r\nThe people can hasten legislation where it moves slowly. They can retard\r\nit where it presses too fast ahead. They themselves can make the pace. And\r\nthe effect on themselves is that, with this added responsibility, they\r\ntake a quick interest in their own concerns. In the first place they break\r\nup the power of political organisations; and in the second place they\r\nthemselves become alert and educated citizens, responsible and intelligent\r\nguiders of their own destinies.\r\n\r\nNor are these the imaginings of theory. They are the practical outcome in\r\nevery country or state where the Referendum and Initiative have been\r\nadopted. They have especially been the result in Switzerland, where, by\r\nmeans of the Initiative, the people have insisted on measures being passed\r\nthat no political party would have dared to undertake. For there are many\r\nquestions that cut clean across all parties, which dare not offend a\r\nmajority or a minority, and where therefore the unity of the party comes\r\nbefore the interest of the nation. But minorities from all parties may\r\njoin, and in Switzerland have joined, together to press for their\r\nadoption, with the consequence that the National Assembly has had no\r\nalternative but to frame legislation to deal with them. And when such\r\nlegislation has come before the people by the Referendum, the people have\r\nin many cases adopted them.\r\n\r\nThe presence, therefore, in our Constitution of both the Referendum and\r\nthe Initiative is therefore a sign that the people of Ireland are to be\r\nrulers in their own house--not merely as against foreign control, but as\r\nagainst the dominance of political parties. It means more. It means that\r\nresponsibility is now definitely reposed in them. There are provisions\r\nwhich, in the present draft of the Constitution, could with advantage be\r\nchanged. For to require, in Article 43, that a petition from the people of\r\nnot less than \"one-twentieth of the voters then on the register\" is\r\nnecessary (in the alternative of a vote of three-fifths of the Senate),\r\nbefore a measure may be put to the Referendum, is to impose an almost\r\nimpracticable, and certainly an extremely difficult, task. It reveals a\r\nfear of the exercise of the Referendum that experience in other countries\r\ndoes not justify. With the wide franchise allowed in the Constitution, the\r\ntendency will be to play into the hands of political parties, and one of\r\nthe purposes of the Referendum is to destroy the power of political\r\nparties. Yet a slight change here may easily be made. And the essential\r\nfact is that the people of Ireland, having asserted the fact of their\r\nsovereignty, and defined its qualities, proceed to exercise its functions\r\nby holding over the Oireachtas the two instruments of the Referendum and\r\nthe Initiative.\r\n\r\nHow will those functions be exercised? It is impossible to say, except\r\nthat there is no education like the education of responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nTHE EXECUTIVE POWER.\r\n\r\nI have likened a Constitution to a pyramid, the base of which is the\r\nPeople, and the apex the Executive Authority. In all pyramids, it is the\r\napex that first catches the eye, not the base; yet it is from the base\r\nupward that democratic constitutions are built. Usually it happens in most\r\ncountries that the Executive masters the Law-making body, and that the\r\nLaw-making body in turn masters the People. It is therefore necessary to\r\nremember, and to emphasise, that the true order is the other way about,\r\nthe People being the master of the Law-making body, and the Law-making\r\nbody the master of the Executive. In the degree in which that true order\r\nis asserted, and observed, the health of the State is preserved. In the\r\ndegree in which it is neglected, or frustrated, there is suspicion,\r\nirritation, discontent. And as it is always the Executive which tends\r\nnaturally, where it does not intrigue deliberately, to upset that order,\r\nby gathering all power into its hands, obviously the provisions respecting\r\nthe formation and maintenance of Executive Power are the most critical\r\npart of every Constitution.\r\n\r\nIt was a wise man, and an experienced, who said that it did not matter to\r\nhim who had the making of laws, so long as he had the administration of\r\nthem. \"For forms of government let fools contest,\" said the poet; \"That\r\nwhich is best administered is best.\" And as the administration of a State\r\nis reposed in the care of the Executive Power, for the most part beyond\r\nthe sight of the Law-making Assembly of the people, it is essential that\r\nthe Constitution should provide that the Executive should at all times,\r\nand with the utmost flexibility, lie in the control of the Legislature.\r\nOtherwise, whatever safeguards may be provided that laws carry the consent\r\nof the people, the people will in the end find themselves baffled, unable\r\nto track into the thicket of secret decisions the will that they have\r\nelsewhere endeavoured plainly to express.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore the plain duty of every Constitution to keep the Executive\r\nsimple and flexible, responsive always to the will of the Legislature, as\r\nthe Legislature should always be responsive to the will of the people.\r\nCrises will arise in the history of every nation when the powers of the\r\nExecutive require to be strengthened; and at such times those powers will\r\nbe readily conceded. But it is the Legislature and the people which must\r\ndecide; and the Constitution must leave them free to do so. It is no part\r\nof the duty of a Constitution to provide for a time of crisis, and to make\r\nthat provision fixed and rigid for all later times, when circumstances\r\nwill have completely changed.\r\n\r\nAll that it is the absolute duty of a Constitution to do is to state how\r\nthe Executive shall be formed, and to define its responsibility to the\r\nLegislature. The rest may be left to the practice of the future. Certainly\r\nto indulge in experiments in a Constitution respecting so vital a part of\r\nit as the Executive (experiments unlike anything yet attempted in any\r\nConstitution in the world) is an extremely hazardous proceeding. Nor are\r\nsuch experiments necessary in a Constitution, since they may be tried in\r\nthe course of ordinary legislation, and surrendered if they prove\r\nimpracticable. It is one thing to experiment--which a Constitution should\r\nallow. It is another thing to be pledged to one's experiments for\r\never--which is what a Constitutional provision is intended to mean.\r\n\r\nThe experimental nature of the provisions for the Executive in the present\r\ndraft of the Constitution is manifest. They are unlike anything in any\r\nConstitution. They are quite unlike the provisions in the Swiss\r\nConstitution, from which the inspiration is supposed to be derived.\r\nSwitzerland is a Confederation, consisting of twenty-two sovereign\r\ncantons, where only limited powers are conferred on the federal\r\nauthorities. The twenty-two sovereign cantons differ widely in religion,\r\nlanguage, habits and traditions. They are jealous of the federal\r\nauthorities, and jealous of one another, and therefore insist that the\r\nFederal Council (which acts as the Executive), as well as the Federal\r\nAssembly, shall be representative directly of the languages, religions and\r\ntraditions of different parts of the country. Certain of the larger towns\r\nand cantons, indeed, claim prescriptive rights to the appointment of\r\nmembers of the Federal Council. This Council, therefore, is appointed for\r\nthe whole term of the Assembly by the two chambers of the Assembly sitting\r\ntogether, and are chosen by the two chambers, as the Constitution says,\r\n\"from among all Swiss citizens eligible to the National Council.\" The\r\nmembers of the Council may speak, and propose motions, in both chambers,\r\nbut they may not vote in either, for they form a separate institution\r\noutside the Assembly.\r\n\r\nIt is well to see what are the provisions for the Executive Power under\r\nthe Swiss Constitution in order to note how widely the Executive in our\r\ndraft differs from them. Good or bad, our draft stands or falls by itself,\r\nand cannot depend from the Swiss example, from which it differs both in\r\nitself and in the circumstance which it is designed to meet. The intention\r\nmay be of the noblest; but intentions are only prophecies; and the\r\nFundamental Law of a Constitution is scarcely the place to commit a whole\r\npeople to a prophecy. The intention is to overcome party government, and\r\nis conceived at a time when parties are divided along lines that do not\r\nrepresent the economic issues that ordinarily influence the course of\r\nlegislation. For parties, in so far as parties represent true economic\r\nissues, are a natural and inevitable medium for conducting the government\r\nof a country. Where parties do not represent such issues, but are held\r\ntogether by unnatural organisations, they do, it is true, obscure the\r\norderly government of a country. The remedy is to be found, not in an\r\nenforced and arbitrary creation of an Executive, but in the right election\r\nof the Legislature, of which the Executive must be a reflection if the\r\nLegislature is to work harmoniously with it, and keep a constant control\r\nover it. To attempt by arbitrary provisions to create an Executive that\r\ndoes not accurately and at all times reflect the Legislature (on whatever\r\nparty lines that Legislature be composed) is automatically to remove that\r\nExecutive from the continuous control of the Legislature. And it is surely\r\nthe essential business of a Constitution to insist that that control be\r\nemphasised, not diminished. Otherwise, whatever be the intention, the\r\nExecutive will become irresponsible, government will fall into the hands\r\nof rulers who can only with difficulty be removed, and constant friction\r\nwill ensue.\r\n\r\nSuch is the broader line of argument. In detail the Executive provisions\r\nof the present draft seem even less defensible. For authority is reposed\r\nin an Executive Council formed of two parts. Of twelve Ministers, it is\r\nstated, four must be members of the Chamber and eight must not be\r\nmembers--or, if they were members before, they cannot continue to be\r\nmembers, and must resign. It is true that on the motion of the President\r\nof the Council these four (who are members of the Chamber) may be\r\nincreased to seven; but the draft makes it perfectly clear that according\r\nto the normal procedure under the Constitution the proportions are to be\r\nfour and eight; and it is on the normal, not on the exceptional, procedure\r\nthat attention must therefore necessarily be laid.\r\n\r\nEight out of twelve Ministers, therefore, are not permitted by the draft\r\nto be, or to remain, members of the Legislature. If they were members\r\nbefore their appointment as Ministers, they must resign. Consequently,\r\nwithin a few days of a General Election, bye-elections become necessary in\r\nrespect of so many Ministers as were elected as deputies--although other\r\nMinisters who are elected as deputies may continue to remain both as\r\nMinisters and as deputies. The General Election, however, was held under\r\nthe Constitution on the principles of Proportional Representation. But\r\nbye-elections, in such a case, cannot be held according to Proportional\r\nRepresentation. They become a party tussle between two or more candidates.\r\nThe first effect of this arrangement, therefore, is to increase the number\r\nof elections, with their confusion and unrest, to create party contests in\r\ntheir strongest form, and to undo the proportional representation of the\r\nnation in the Legislature. Someone of an entirely different party might be\r\nreturned in such a bye-election from the person who resigned on\r\nappointment as Minister; and the representation of minorities be directly\r\ninjured as a consequence.\r\n\r\nThat would be the immediate result. The next to follow would be that the\r\nnation would find itself faced with the danger of an Executive within an\r\nExecutive. For the eight external Ministers are to be appointed for the\r\nwhole life of that Chamber. They are to be nominated by a Committee itself\r\nspecially elected for that purpose. They cannot be removed during the life\r\nof that Chamber unless the Committee finds that they have been guilty of\r\nmalfeasance, incompetence or disobedience to the will of the\r\nChamber--definite sins of omission which are not always easily susceptible\r\nof proof. This is of itself sufficient to remove them from constant\r\ncontrol by the Chamber. But the four internal Ministers are, for some\r\nreason, to be appointed in quite a different manner, and they hold office\r\nby quite a different tenure. They are to be appointed on the nomination of\r\nthe President of the Council. They can at any time be removed by an\r\nordinary vote of the Chamber. They must therefore study the Chamber, and\r\ndevise their policies to suit its will, for they are subject to its\r\nconstant control.\r\n\r\nThe whole twelve, it is true, are said to form one single Executive\r\nCouncil. But what are the chances of this? Is it not only too clear that\r\nthe four internal Ministers, since they can be removed by an ordinary vote\r\n(which the eight cannot), will frequently, and in most larger matters,\r\nmeet and act separately together in coming to their decisions? Will not\r\nnecessity drive them to this? But this would mean at once, not one\r\nExecutive Council, but two--one within the other. This is acknowledged to\r\nbe a dangerous practice. We know what happened in England when during the\r\nEuropean war a similar practice was adopted, and how soon it became\r\nnecessary to change it. And is it not equally clear that they will, and\r\nmust, use the majority that keeps them in power to make the eight external\r\nMinisters subservient to their will, if their policies cross, without\r\ncalling them into council? For the policies of all Ministers cross, and\r\ninter-cross, and should do so if there is to be a harmonious and healthy\r\nadministration, especially in questions and policies of finance.\r\n\r\nUltimately the temptation will always be present to these four internal\r\nMinisters to get subservient persons nominated to the positions to be held\r\nby the eight external Ministers. They themselves will have come to power\r\nby a majority of the Chamber. Of that majority they will be the\r\nacknowledged leaders; and it would be strange if they did not use that\r\nmajority to find eight external Ministers to their liking. But where this\r\nhappened (as happen it certainly would, in the ordinary human\r\nprobabilities of the situation) a very remarkable result would come to\r\npass, unlike anything in the history of representative government. This\r\nis, that the Four would in practice dictate the Executive policy of the\r\nEight, but they would not be answerable to the Chamber for the\r\nadministrative conduct of those eight departments. They would require what\r\nmust be done, but they would not themselves be responsible for the manner\r\nin which it was done, or whether it were done at all. For the Eight would\r\nhave been nominated for the life of the Chamber by a special Committee,\r\nthey would not be members of the Chamber, they would not be susceptible\r\nto a vote of lack of confidence, but could only be removed when the\r\nCommittee which nominated them had found them guilty of some public\r\nmisconduct in their administration.\r\n\r\nThe first result of this amazing separation of executive and\r\nadministrative responsibility would be that the Chamber, looking from one\r\nto the other in the attempt to fix the ultimate responsibility, would find\r\nitself with only the vain shadow of control. For the Eight would in theory\r\nbe responsible to it, but in practice--certainly on all major matters of\r\npolicy--would be directed by the Four. Yet the Four could not be held\r\nresponsible for the doings of the Eight. And the second result would be\r\nthat the Eight would be little more than Civil Servants. Yet they would\r\nnot be Civil Servants. They would neither be Ministers nor Civil Servants,\r\nhaving neither one kind of responsibility nor the other.\r\n\r\nThe baffling consequence would be that the Chamber would not only lose\r\ncontrol over the Eight, but, because of the same division between\r\nexecutive and administrative responsibility, would lose control over the\r\nwhole Executive (including the Four) in respect of functions ascribed to\r\nthe Eight. It is in the details of administrative practice that the\r\ncontrol of the Legislature is usually most important; and it is in just\r\nthese details that, by the division of the Council into two kinds of\r\nMinisters, with different methods of appointment and removal and different\r\nsorts of tenure, that the Chamber will under these provisions have lost\r\nits control. It is true that it would have the remedy of putting out the\r\nFour; but few Chambers, having appointed the head or heads of a\r\nGovernment, desire to throw them out except on some fundamental, paramount\r\nissue. The remedy might be worse than the evil; and thus, by its\r\nreluctance to take so drastic a step, and by the division of\r\nresponsibility, it would lose its continuous control over the Executive\r\nwhich is the very breath of legislative freedom.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to point, further, to the danger of nominating a large\r\npart of an Executive under these circumstances through a Committee. It is\r\nnotorious that Committees are, or can be made, more easily accessible to\r\nintrigue than larger assemblies. The Chamber itself should be its own\r\nCommittee for the selection of Ministers, on the recommendation of the\r\nPresident of the Council, with whom they would have to work. This\r\nprovision still further removes the Executive from the control of the\r\nChamber. And so the order of responsibility is inverted, which the plan of\r\nthe Constitution elsewhere so constantly emphasises. For the People may at\r\nall times, by the Referendum and the Initiative, control the Legislature.\r\nBut the Legislature cannot, under these provisions, at all times and so\r\nsimply control the Executive. And so control fails just at the point where\r\nauthority tends most to arrogate power to itself.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, also, the Legislature loses what generally has proved its\r\ngreatest source of strength. For the best informed critics of any Chamber\r\nare those who once were Ministers, who appreciate the responsibility of\r\nMinisters, and who temper their words as members with their knowledge and\r\nexperience. But, under these provisions, a member who is appointed as one\r\nof the external Ministers ceases to be a Member. If he therefore finds it\r\nincumbent on him to resign, because of disagreement with his colleagues of\r\nthe Executive (Inner or Outer), he ceases to be both a Minister and a\r\nMember, and his service and knowledge are lost to the Chamber--not to\r\nspeak of the loss of detailed information on the cause of the particular\r\nissue of his resignation, on which the Chamber may wish enlightenment.\r\nIndeed, such a provision as this seems peculiarly arbitrary and\r\nmeaningless.\r\n\r\nThere is, indeed, much virtue in the liberty of the Chamber to appoint as\r\nMinisters persons who may be specially qualified, but who may not be\r\nmembers. In the jostle at the hustings to enter a Chamber of but two\r\nhundred members it is unlikely that the best ability would always succeed,\r\nif it were so much as willing to share the fray. A Legislature should\r\ntherefore not be hampered in the choice of its Executive by restricting\r\nthat choice to two hundred persons. If persons, not members of the\r\nChamber, were appointed as Ministers, clearly they could not vote; but\r\nthey could be present, could speak, and could propose motions on behalf of\r\nthe Executive of which they were members. But the whole Executive should\r\nshare an equal responsibility, and be subject at all times to the\r\ncontinuous control of the Legislature, of which they are the servants, not\r\nthe masters.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nTHE JUDICIARY.\r\n\r\nThe three organic parts of every Constitution are the Legislature, for the\r\nmaking and enacting of laws, the Executive, for the execution and\r\nadministration of laws, and the Judicature, for the interpretation and\r\nenforcement of laws. These three comprise the powers of Government which a\r\npeople bestow on certain organisations which they create for that purpose,\r\nin the sovereign act of conferring a Constitution on themselves. The\r\nauthority which such organisations shall henceforward exercise in Ireland\r\nderive, under the Constitution, from the people of Ireland; and from no\r\nright or power, pretended or real, existing elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe first of these three organic parts, obviously, is the Legislature,\r\nsince laws cannot be executed or interpreted until they first exist. The\r\nsecond, equally obviously, is the Executive, since laws, having come into\r\nexistence, must first be put into execution before they can be liable to\r\ninterpretation, or before they can be said to require enforcement. But\r\nwhen a Legislature and an Executive have been brought into existence, as\r\nnecessary organisations for a people's government of themselves, a\r\nJudicial organisation at once becomes necessary. For no law can so be made\r\nas of itself to fit each particular case. Laws, by their nature, are of\r\ngeneral meaning, and must be interpreted to the particular instance where\r\nits construction is questioned. And there is (unhappily) no law that is\r\nnot sometimes altogether challenged, and set at defiance, when therefore\r\nthe law made by the people at large must be enforced on the individual,\r\nand its defiance punished.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately few people regard their Judicature with the same pride of\r\npossession with which they (sometimes) regard the Legislature, and even\r\nthe Executive. Even when folk disapprove of their law-makers and their\r\nministers, they disapprove because they conceive they have acted\r\nmistakenly on their behalf, whereas they conceive of judges as having\r\nacted from a malignancy inborn in them or in the system, with the kind of\r\ndisapproval reserved for those who are created and are destined to act\r\nagainst their behalf. That is--in most countries, and especially in\r\nIreland--a legacy from evil days, when judges were not the people's\r\njudges, but whips sent forth through the land by some person who claimed\r\nto be sovereign. With the reversal of sovereignty, however, the judges\r\nbecome the people's judges; the courts are the people's courts, where the\r\nlaws of their own making are interpreted; the judicial system is the\r\npeople's system; and it is for the people to insist that this attitude is\r\nobserved, not only by them, but by those who interpret the laws and\r\nadminister justice. For, under the Constitution, no judge sits in any\r\ncourt in the land save by an authority bestowed on him by the people, in\r\nthe Constitution which they confer on themselves. And it is for the people\r\nto remember that fact; for only by that memory will it be recognised in\r\nthe courts themselves--and, indeed, only thus will it deserve to be\r\nrecognised there.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, necessary that the details of the judicial system\r\nshould be worked out in the Constitution. It is not, indeed, desirable\r\nthat they should be (a consideration worthy of attention, not alone here,\r\nbut in connection with the provisions for the Executive also), for such\r\ndetails belong to later legislation. All that is required in the\r\nConstitution is the general outline of the Judiciary, and a statement of\r\nits organic relation to the other parts of the powers of government\r\ncreated under it. How that outline will be completed, and the details of\r\nthe organic relation made good, must be dealt with in a subsequent\r\nJudiciary Act, preceded probably by a Judiciary Commission established to\r\nreview the whole of the present system and to report to Government on the\r\nchanges required. In the meantime the present system will continue,\r\nsubject to the principles and plan of the Constitution, which is the law\r\nfundamental to the later Act, and therefore at once of effect in respect\r\nof its general principles and plan.\r\n\r\nAccording to that plan the entire system of courts and titles that derive\r\nfrom ancient feudal practice is abolished. A new and simple system comes\r\ninto existence, comprising a number of courts, civil or criminal, of\r\noriginal instance and a Court of Final Appeal. The Court of Final Appeal\r\nis to be known as the Supreme Court, and the chief of the courts of first\r\ninstance as the High Court. In these courts all cases are entered, and the\r\nCivil Authority of the Nation is made paramount in all circumstances. \"The\r\njurisdiction of Courts Martial,\" says Article 69, \"shall not be extended\r\nto or exercised over the civil population save in time of war, and for\r\nacts committed in time of war, and in accordance with the regulations to\r\nbe preserved by law. Such jurisdiction shall not be exercised in any area\r\nin which the civil courts are open or capable of being held, and no person\r\nshall be removed from one area to another for the purpose of creating such\r\njurisdiction.\" Moreover, soldiers themselves are relieved from Courts\r\nMartial, unless they are on active service, except for purely military\r\noffences. For Article 70 reads: \"A member of the armed forces of the Irish\r\nFree State not on active service shall not be tried by any Court Martial\r\nfor an offence cognisable by the Civil Courts.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, however, how safeguards such as these, together with the\r\nqualities of sovereignty declared in the Constitution to be the\r\nFundamental Rights of the people, shall be protected. For it is a\r\ntemptation to all governments to find an easy way out of difficulties by\r\nriding roughshod over rights and safeguards, however earnestly they may be\r\ndeclared. There is only one answer. In the making of constitutions there\r\ncan be only one answer. It is that the Judiciary is the People's\r\nJudiciary, and the third part of the organic whole of Government which the\r\npeople create. Article 64, therefore, reads that \"the judicial power of\r\nthe High Court\"--with appeal to the Supreme Court--\"shall extend to the\r\nquestion of the validity of any law having regard to the provisions of the\r\nConstitution.\" The Judiciary is the interpreter of laws. It is therefore\r\nthe interpreter of the Fundamental Law. And it is therefore the\r\ninterpreter of the Fundamental Law and the protector of the Fundamental\r\nLaw, as against all other laws of the Legislature that may violate it, not\r\nto say arbitrary acts of the Executive that may neglect it.\r\n\r\nIt must be so. There is no other way to protect the guarantee of\r\nfundamental rights written carefully in a people's constitution. Without\r\nsome such provision a Constitution might be written in water, and its\r\nguarantees set aside by any powerful executive, or any executive not\r\ninstantly answerable to the people's will. A provision of this kind is,\r\ntherefore, a necessary democratic safeguard. It is true that in the United\r\nStates the judicial review of the Supreme Court over legislative and\r\nexecutive acts has led to unfortunate decisions and much acrimonious\r\ndiscussion. The evils of an institution are always apparent, and no\r\ninstitution but has its evils. The evils that would have come into\r\nexistence had that institution not been there, however, are not apparent.\r\nThey are the incalculable part of the bargain; and, being incalculable,\r\nare inevitably neglected in argument. Yet they may prove to be the\r\noverwhelming factor of the argument. So it is in this case. It would be\r\nblindness to neglect it. The mere existence of the Judicial Review in the\r\nUnited States has unquestionably prevented many an arbitrary act of the\r\nExecutive in defiance of the rights ensured by the Constitution; and if\r\nthe Supreme Court has, as it undoubtedly has, abused its power of\r\ninterpretation, the remedy is, not to sweep away that Judicial Review, and\r\nso to jeopardise the provisions of the Constitution, but to amend the\r\nConstitution in plainer terms, or to amend the Supreme Court. For it is\r\nplain that without Judicial Protection of the Fundamental Law (as the\r\nJudiciary is required to protect, interpret and enforce the ordinary law)\r\nits clearest provisions could be neglected at pleasure.\r\n\r\nI may take only one instance. Article 9 of the Constitution protects the\r\nright of free expression of opinion, the right of free assembly, and the\r\nright of forming associations not opposed to public morality. Now it\r\nhardly needs to be said that no Government likes the expression of\r\nopinions hostile to itself. And no Government likes associations formed to\r\nbring its hour to an end. Under the Constitution the minorities of the day\r\nhave the honest chance of becoming the majorities of the morrow in a\r\npeaceable manner. But what would be the worth of this honest chance before\r\na powerful Government unless these protections, these rights of a\r\nsovereign people, were placed in the care of the third institution of the\r\nConstitution, the institution entrusted with the interpretation and\r\nenforcement of laws?\r\n\r\nIt is true that the Judiciary may abuse its power (since power is nearly\r\nalways abused) by interpreting social reform, let us say, to be \"opposed\r\nto public morality.\" But in this connection, it is right to remember,\r\nfirst, that judgment is not reserved only to one Court, but to two\r\nCourts--to the High Court, with appeal to the Supreme Court. And it is\r\nright to remember, next, that the people have always in their possession\r\nthe instruments of the Initiative and the Referendum, by which they may\r\nrequire either the Fundamental Law or later laws to be amended to meet\r\ntheir need. There are, therefore, considerable safeguards in the\r\nConstitution against abuse. Yet, even so, because one-fourth of a\r\nfundamental right may be jeopardised by an abuse of the Judicial Power,\r\nthat is no reason why four-fourths should be surrendered to the abuse of\r\nthe Executive Power.\r\n\r\nTherefore the Judiciary is placed in care of the provisions of the\r\nConstitution, not to imperil but to protect them. The rights conferred in\r\nthe Constitution are the People's rights. The Constitution is the People's\r\nConstitution. The Judiciary is the People's Judiciary. It is for the\r\npeople, by alert and active citizenship, to make them so in every real\r\nsense.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION OF APPEALS.\r\n\r\nIn the section dealing with the Judiciary one provision lends itself at\r\nonce to criticism. It is hostile, on the face of it, to the entire spirit\r\nof the Constitution. It has everywhere created bitterness and irritation\r\namong the other co-equal members of the Commonwealth of Nations, which\r\nIreland has now joined. If the purpose of life, therefore, is to learn\r\nfrom experience as one may reasonably believe, in spite of an apparently\r\nunited conviction to the contrary, a new State at the outset of its career\r\nwould be well advised not to create trouble for the future, and others\r\nwould be well advised to honour that quite reasonable wish. And yet in\r\nthis provision there lies hid a principle of very great meaning, if it\r\ncould be extracted, separated from its feudal lumber, and wrought upon\r\ncreatively.\r\n\r\nI refer to the provision at the end of Article 65. The article itself\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n     \"The Supreme Court of the Irish Free State shall, with such\r\n     exceptions (not including cases which involve questions as to the\r\n     validity of any law) and subject to such regulations as may be\r\n     prescribed by law, have appellate jurisdiction from all decisions of\r\n     the High Court. The decision of the Supreme Court shall in all cases\r\n     be final and conclusive, and shall not be reviewed or capable of\r\n     being reviewed by any other Court, Tribunal or Authority whatsoever.\"\r\n\r\nTo which, in the present draft, the following apparently contradictory\r\nwords are now added:\r\n\r\n     \"Provided that nothing in this Constitution shall impair the right of\r\n     any person to petition His Majesty for special leave to appeal from\r\n     the Supreme Court to His Majesty in Council or the right of His\r\n     Majesty to grant such leave.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to this article as it now stands the Supreme Court of the Irish\r\nFree State is the highest court of appeal for all citizens of that State;\r\nbut if any citizen, or any corporation, desires to affront the sense of\r\nthose amongst whom he, or it, lives, he or it may carry a case elsewhere,\r\noutside the country altogether. This is known as the right of appeal to\r\nthe Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The right is rooted in the\r\nprinciple of Crown prerogative--a prerogative which has been removed in\r\nthe highest questions of life and death, but which apparently exists in\r\nsmaller matters, although there too it has been described by no less an\r\nauthority than Professor Berriedale Keith as \"in process of obsolescence,\"\r\nso far as the other members of the Commonwealth are concerned.\r\n\r\nApart from the theory of the matter, however (a theory vested in an\r\noutworn feudalism), what is its effect in practice? That practice can be\r\ninvestigated on its merits, without the least prejudice; and it will be\r\nfound that it has not produced justice, and that it has proved fruitful of\r\nincreasing irritation and anger.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, such a right of appeal out of the country defeats the\r\nends of justice by placing a premium on wealth. It has so proved among the\r\nother members of the Commonwealth. It is obvious that it must be so. For\r\nit requires a large purse to carry a case out of the country, once it has\r\nbeen well handled in at least two courts at home. Therefore the experience\r\nin Canada, Australia and S. Africa is that only strong corporations take\r\nadvantage of such a right of appeal, because only strong corporations\r\npossess the moneys, and only strong corporations can afford to defy local\r\nfeeling, since local feeling cannot react easily against anything so\r\npowerful while so intangible as a corporation.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, it defeats the ends of justice because it is an\r\nappeal to a court where the local circumstances are not familiar, and\r\nwhere it may even happen (as it will certainly happen in the case of\r\nIreland) that the very axioms of the law may not be rightly apprehended.\r\nFor a central court of appeal of this kind supposes uniform circumstances\r\nand uniform law. Now the circumstances manifestly are not uniform. Yet\r\nneither is the law likely to be uniform. The example of S. Africa may be\r\ntaken. In S. Africa the law in force is Roman-Dutch law, not the English\r\nCommon Law. It has therefore proved that the Judicial Committee has been\r\nrequired to handle an instrument with which it is unfamiliar. The same\r\nwill apply in Ireland, where it has already proved, notoriously, that the\r\nprinciples of the law known familiarly as \"Brehon law\" have worked in\r\nopposition to the black-letter precedents of English law.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, however, it is to be remembered that the lawyers\r\ncomposing the Judicial Committee are obviously unfamiliar with the\r\nprinciples underlying the structure of our Constitution, since they are\r\nquite unlike the principles with which they themselves have to deal. One\r\nneed not argue which are the better. It is enough that they are unlike. A\r\nmechanic cannot be supposed to deliver impartial justice between two\r\nfarmers in a matter of farming economy. The famous case of the Loch Neagh\r\nfisheries is enough to prove that only those who are familiar, not only\r\nwith Irish circumstances, but with Irish history, can expect to deliver\r\njustice in Irish matters.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there is a further consideration, which the plain facts of the\r\ncase require should be firmly stated--and which the experience of other\r\nnations of the Commonwealth emphasises. It is that under the chief of the\r\ntwo heads under which such appeals to the Judicial Committee would fall\r\nthe very intention to do impartial and indifferent justice could not\r\npresumed in advance. For all such appeals involve two classes of cases.\r\nThe first deals with appeals from interpretation of the ordinary law. The\r\nsecond deals with appeals from interpretations of the Fundamental Law of\r\nthe Constitution. Now appeals from an interpretation of the ordinary law\r\nheard in some country where the principles of that law are unfamiliar\r\nwould, as has been indicated, involve injustices enough; but they would\r\nconcern only the individual or some corporate enterprise. The injustice\r\nwould exist; but it would be limited; and lawyers of another country might\r\nbe supposed to wish to search for justice, even if the trading enterprise\r\nhad its seat in their own nation and the individual were Irish. But a\r\nConstitution is the very charter of a nation's freedom.\r\n\r\nCases concerning an interpretation of the Constitution are vital to a\r\nwhole people, and, as between two nations, vital to international safety\r\nand polity. And such cases could, under the circumstances, only arise\r\nbetween two nations, Ireland, whose the Constitution is, and England,\r\nwhose the Constitution is not, and where parties might arise to power who\r\nwould intrigue to impeach that Constitution. Moreover, in England it is\r\nfrequently the practice to recruit the higher offices of the Judiciary,\r\nnot from men of acknowledged skill in the achievement of equity, but\r\nrather from men who have snatched a casual eminence in the heat of party\r\nstrife, men of political passions and political prejudices, who have come\r\nto the front by the very profession of partisanship. It is such men who\r\nwill form for the most part the lawyers of the Judicial Committee. Even if\r\nthe road to that Committee were of the straightest and purest legal\r\ncharacter, no reasonable person would expect it to deliver impartial\r\njudgment on the Fundamental Law of another nation, especially if an\r\nadjustment of the liberties of two nations were concerned, one of those\r\nnations being, more than conceivably, their own. But since the road is,\r\nadmittedly, neither of the straightest nor of the purest, the expectation\r\nof impartial and indifferent justice would be a fool's dream. And where a\r\nCourt exists from which a people presumes injustice in advance, the wells\r\nof security and good order are at once poisoned.\r\n\r\nYet, even supposing that these questions of justice are neglected, how is\r\nthe system likely to work? How has it, in fact, worked elsewhere? Assume\r\nthat a case has been decided in a certain way by the Supreme Court in\r\nIreland. It is carried to the Judicial Committee, which decides in favour\r\nof the opposite party. How is such a decision of the Judicial Committee to\r\nbe put into effect? Such cases have occurred in Australia; and the\r\nAustralian High Court has refused to recognise the decisions of the\r\nJudicial Committee, or to give them effect. Special legislation therefore\r\nat once became necessary; but the obvious fact which emerged was that the\r\nJudicial Committee had no machinery to put decisions into effect which\r\nwere contrary to local feeling. Of the last of these cases the Australian\r\nPremier said at the \"'Imperial Conference,' 1917,\" that the \"decision was\r\none which must have caused great embarrassment and confusion if it were\r\nnot for the fortunate fact that the reasons for the Judicial Committee's\r\ndecision are stated in such a way that no Court and no Council in\r\nAustralia has yet been able to find out what they were.\"\r\n\r\nIt is little wonder that Mr. Hughes in the same speech should have said\r\nthat \"Australia's experience of the Privy Council in constitutional cases\r\nhas been, to say the least of it, unfortunate.\" He also read an extract\r\nfrom a resolution of the Final Court of Appeal of New Zealand, which\r\ndeclared of the Judicial Committee that \"by its imputations in the present\r\ncase, by the ignorance it has shown in this and in other cases of our\r\nhistory, of our legislation, and of our practice, and by its long delayed\r\njudgments, it has displayed every characteristic of an alien tribunal.\"\r\n\r\nThe spokesmen for the other States present were equally emphatic. \"I\r\nthink,\" said Sir Robert Borden for Canada, \"we have had just about enough\r\nAppeal Courts, and I think the tendency in our country will be to\r\nrestrict appeals to the Privy Council rather than to increase them.\"\r\n\"There is,\" said Mr. Rowell for the same State, \"a growing opinion that\r\nour own Courts should be the final authority.\" \"You know what our opinion\r\nis in S. Africa,\" said Mr. Burton. \"In our Constitution we have abolished\r\nthe right of appeal to the Privy Council as a right. There is no such\r\nright with us at all, but the Constitution merely says that any right\r\nresiding in the King in Council to grant special leave to appeal shall not\r\nbe interfered with.\"\r\n\r\nThese utterances, and the entire course of history on this matter, reveal\r\nan irritation which has grown with experience. The mechanism is merely a\r\nmechanism, and it has not worked well. It has injured harmony, and it\r\nmanifestly has not brought justice. Even assuming that the Irish courts\r\nshould agree that the decision in any individual case appealed from should\r\nstand, it could equally well argue that that decision could not be held to\r\ngovern other cases; and the effect of such a decision would be to make the\r\nappeal nugatory in law.\r\n\r\nBesides all of which, the right to allow such appeals to the Judicial\r\nCommittee is based, ultimately, on the acknowledgment of the supremacy of\r\nBritish legislation; and the plain intention of our Constitution is that\r\nthis supremacy is not acknowledged, each party to the Treaty being a\r\nco-equal member of a larger Community. Not only, therefore, are the\r\npractical reasons against such a right of appeal, but there is no\r\nsubstance in the Constitution to make such a right allowable.\r\n\r\nThere is, indeed, nothing that can be said in favour of such a provision,\r\nfrom the point of view either of justice, of law, of equity or of harmony.\r\nIf it be destined to remain, it is to be hoped that it will remain a dead\r\nletter. Otherwise it will lead to boundless friction and ill-will,\r\ninternal and external.\r\n\r\nYet there is an excellent principle embedded in this provision. It is very\r\ndeeply, and perhaps almost inextricably, embedded; but it is there. For\r\nif a number of nations are to join together as co-equal members of a\r\nCommunity, plainly there should be some common Court to which all can\r\nappeal with equal confidence. Ireland and England, for instance, have made\r\na Treaty. Either side may violate that Treaty. Who is to judge between\r\nthem? Is the appeal to be to the arbitrament of strength? If so, what of\r\nthe co-equality of the Community? It becomes an idle phrase, however\r\nseparate one may claim to be from the other.\r\n\r\nThe case may be carried even further. A case exists for such a Court, not\r\nonly in respect of their interdependent relations, but not less in respect\r\nof their internal relations. It may even happen that the citizen of a\r\nState, or a combination of citizens, may have a plain case to be carried\r\nto such a Court as against their State, if a Court of sufficient\r\nimpartiality could be established. States are not always immaculate of\r\njustice, particularly to minorities.\r\n\r\nCan such a Court be found? I believe it can. An exposition of the present\r\ndraft of our Constitution is not the place to give the details of such an\r\nalternative. It is sufficient to say that there is such an alternative,\r\nfor which provision could therefore be made in substitution of the present\r\nprovision, against which the requirements of justice and the entire\r\nexperience of the Commonwealth rises in evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nFUNCTIONAL COUNCILS.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of a Constitution, not merely to provide for the present,\r\nbut to leave itself lissom and flexible for the development of the future.\r\nIf those developments can in any way be foreseen, it is its duty further,\r\nto indicate them by allowing specifically for them, without of necessity\r\npledging the future to them. How far these indications may profitably be\r\ncarried is a question not so easy to answer. Times differ. Constitutions\r\nmade at a time of fixed social and political ideas, are necessarily fixed\r\nin their provisions. Constitutions made at a time, such as the present,\r\nwhen social and political ideas are rapidly shifting and changing must\r\nneeds indicate the likelihood of change in certain directions; and make\r\nallowance for such changes. It is therefore striking to notice that in\r\nnearly every Constitution made during and since the Great War such\r\nindications are scattered freely. And from that fact alone the historian\r\nof the future could tell with assurance that these were years of rapidly\r\nchanging conceptions.\r\n\r\nWe in Ireland cannot but have a share in these changes. Fortunately for\r\nus, heirs of an ancient tradition, in looking forward we look backward,\r\nand in looking backward we look forward. We may, and often do, use phrases\r\nidentical with those used by other nations; but in many cases it will be\r\nfound by the thoughtful student that what to them is often social theory,\r\nto us is a slumbering historic memory. Very frequently this will be found\r\nto be the case.\r\n\r\nAn indication of this kind, that looks both forward and backward, is to be\r\nfound in Article 44 of our Constitution. This article has aroused\r\nconsiderable interest. It reads:--\r\n\r\n     \"The Oireachtas may provide for the establishment of Functional or\r\n     Vocational Councils representing branches of the social and economic\r\n     life of the Nation. A law establishing any such Council shall\r\n     determine its powers, rights and duties, and its relation to the\r\n     government of the Irish Free State.\"\r\n\r\nAs a matter of curious interest it happens that the German Constitution\r\ncontains an article very similar to this; but the conception had been in\r\ndevelopment in Ireland for some years. It had, indeed (as I endeavoured to\r\nshew in a little book on _The Gaelic State_, published in 1917), been a\r\nslumbering memory of the Irish Nation during the centuries when the\r\ncharacteristic political conceptions of the people were frustrate and\r\nidle, as they may now be put into practical development. It had been\r\nworked out in practical detail for one of our largest and most important\r\nindustries in the Report on Sea Fisheries of the _Commission of Inquiry_,\r\npublished in 1921. And it had actually, though imperfectly, been in\r\noperation for another great industry since 1896 in the Council of\r\nAgriculture.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are these Functional (or Vocational or Occupational) Councils\r\nfor which provision is made, and on what political or social conception do\r\nthey rest? One need not travel outside the present draft Constitution to\r\ndiscover the need for them. For in this Constitution, as in most\r\nconstitutions, the people are, outside this one Article, considered in\r\nonly two of the three relations that go to make up their lives, and which\r\ntherefore constitute the complete life of the Nation. All the persons of\r\nthe State are considered either as individuals or as citizens. But these\r\ntwo descriptions do not exhaust their lives. In addition to being\r\nindividuals and citizens they are also workers in some craft, industry,\r\ntrade or profession. Indeed, it is seldom they have time to be\r\nindividuals, and it is seldom they are reminded that they are citizens.\r\nFor good or for ill, these are only occasional parts of their lives. But\r\nthey are never permitted to forget the parts they are required to play in\r\nthe social and economic life of the Nation.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution establishes their rights as individuals putting these\r\nrights beyond the reach of interference either of those who make or those\r\nwho execute the law. It also establishes their rights as citizens,\r\ncertifies the manner of their action as citizens, and derives all\r\nauthority in the State from those rights and actions. But these are only\r\nthe lesser, however supremely important, parts of our lives. The greater\r\npart of our days is, for each of us, packed with the thoughts are cares of\r\nour functional lives. We are more frequently, in the intake and output of\r\nour lives, blacksmiths or architects, or whatever else, than we are\r\nindividuals or citizens. Have we not rights and duties there too, both for\r\nourselves and to the Nation; and should not the Constitution make\r\nprovision for this, the larger part of our lives, as well as for the\r\nlesser parts? Can provision be said to have been completely made either\r\nfor our own lives or for the interplay that constitutes the life of the\r\nNation if this aspect be neglected?\r\n\r\nWe are faced at once with a difficulty. Seeing that we have the experience\r\nof it, it is easy to perceive how we can be represented in the State as\r\ncitizens. How can we be represented in the State in respect of our\r\nfunctions? To answer this question one may turn to an instance that lives\r\nbefore us, an example from elder days when such an order of society was\r\nfamiliar. For in old Ireland (as in other nations) guilds were a\r\nrecognised form of the industrial life of the nation. They were also,\r\nthough not known by that name, a recognised form of the professional life\r\nof the Nation. And as a relic of those times we have to-day what is in\r\neffect a guild of Lawyers. The lawyers of Ireland, for example, are\r\norganised as a whole, with a Council representative of the profession as a\r\nwhole. That Council, representative of all who practice as lawyers, is a\r\nresponsible body, not only to the lawyers who are represented in it, but\r\nto and in the State on behalf of the legal profession. It is responsible\r\nfor the honour and good conduct of lawyers. It is responsible for the\r\neconomic maintenance of its constituents. No lawyer is allowed to practice\r\nexcept by consent of the Legal Council--that is to say, except by the\r\nconsent of all other lawyers. The legal profession as a whole--in the\r\nlegal sense, as a Person--protects its own honour, protects the individual\r\nlawyer, protects the public interest (in theory, at least), and requires a\r\nguarantee of efficiency and rectitude from every lawyer before he is\r\nallowed to practice his profession.\r\n\r\nSo it was in ancient Ireland. At that time, when the Assembly of the\r\nNation met, the lawyers, or 'brehons,' met in a Council of their own. The\r\nadministrative heads of each unit of local government met in a Council of\r\ntheir own. The Recorders, or _Seanchaidhe_, of the local petty states, met\r\nin a Council of their own. And each Council was responsible for the\r\nadministration of its own concerns. Each Council drew up its own\r\nregulations, for the conduct of it own duties in the State, and for the\r\nprotection of its own 'functional' rights. Each Council, in the modern\r\nlegal phrase, was a responsible 'Person,' and was by the State, as it\r\nexisted at that time, entrusted with the conduct and administration of its\r\nown affairs, subject to the general execution of the public interest.\r\n\r\nIt lay with the Assembly of the Nation to co-ordinate the whole in the\r\npublic interest. Whether this was or was not done effectively in olden\r\ntimes is indifferent to the present problem of Functional Councils in the\r\nmodern State, with its better organisation and more perfect national\r\nsense. The problem of organisation is very real, but it does not affect\r\nthe necessity of functional representation and functional responsibility\r\nin the State. It is, for example, absurd that persons unfamiliar with\r\narchitectural problems, however highly placed in the nation they may be,\r\nshould be entrusted with architectural decisions that require special\r\ntraining and knowledge. It is equally absurd that a person unfamiliar with\r\nthe needs of the Fishing Industry should, because for political reasons he\r\nshould happen to be chosen as Minister of Fisheries, make proposals and be\r\nresponsible for decisions that affect the present livelihood of fishermen\r\nand the successful future of the Fishing Industry. These matters must be\r\nreposed in the care of representative Functional (Occupational or\r\nVocational) Councils, that should be required to render account, on the\r\none hand, to the Function which they represent, and, on the other hand, to\r\nthe State on behalf of that Function.\r\n\r\nWhen such an organisation of the social and economic life of the Nation\r\nhas been achieved, then, and only then, will it be possible to say that\r\nall parts of the life of the Nation have been brought within the reach and\r\nauthority of the Constitution. It may be objected that these matters lie\r\nin the future. That is true. The Constitution allows for them, and by\r\nallowing for them indicates that they should be, and probably will be, the\r\nnatural development of the future of the Irish Nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDraft Constitution of the Irish Free State\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY.\r\n\r\nThese presents shall be construed with reference to the Articles of\r\nAgreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland set forth in the\r\nSchedule hereto annexed (hereinafter referred to as \"the Scheduled\r\nTreaty\") which are hereby given the force of law, and if any provision of\r\nthis Constitution or of any amendment thereof or of any law made\r\nthereunder is in any respect repugnant to any of the provisions of the\r\nScheduled Treaty, it shall, to the extent only of such repugnancy be\r\nabsolutely void and inoperative and the Parliament and the Executive\r\nCouncil of the Irish Free State shall respectively pass such further\r\nlegislation and do all such other things as may be necessary to implement\r\nthe Scheduled Treaty.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.--FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS.\r\n\r\nARTICLE 1.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Free State/Saorstat Eireann is a co-equal member of the\r\nCommunity of Nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.\r\n\r\nARTICLE 2.\r\n\r\nAll powers of government and all authority legislative, executive, and\r\njudicial, are derived from the people and the same shall be exercised in\r\nthe Irish Free State/Saorstat Eireann through the organisations\r\nestablished by or under, and in accord with, this Constitution.\r\n\r\nARTICLE 3.\r\n\r\nEvery person domiciled in the Irish Free State/Saorstat Eireann at the\r\ntime of the coming into operation of this Constitution who was born in\r\nIreland or either of whose parents was born in Ireland or who has been so\r\ndomiciled in the area of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State/Saorstat\r\nEireann for not less than seven years is a citizen of the Irish Free\r\nState/Saorstat Eireann and shall within the limits of the Irish Free\r\nState/Saorstat Eireann enjoy the privileges and be subject to the\r\nobligations of such citizenship, provided that any such person being a\r\ncitizen of another State may elect not to accept the citizenship hereby\r\nconferred; and the conditions governing the future acquisition and\r\ntermination of citizenship in the Irish Free State/Saorstat Eireann shall\r\nbe determined by law.

King George V., his heirs and successors by\r\n     law in virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland with Great Britain\r\n     and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming\r\n     the British Commonwealth of Nations.\r\n\r\n5. The Irish Free State shall assume liability for the service of the\r\nPublic Debt of the United Kingdom as existing at the date hereof and\r\ntowards the payment of war pensions as existing at that date in such\r\nproportion as may be fair and equitable, having regard to any just claims\r\non the part of Ireland by way of set off or counterclaim, the amount of\r\nsuch sums being determined in default of agreement by the arbitration of\r\none or more independent persons being citizens of the British Empire.\r\n\r\n6. Until an arrangement has been made between the British and Irish\r\nGovernments whereby the Irish Free State undertakes her own coastal\r\ndefence, the defence by sea of Great Britain and Ireland shall be\r\nundertaken by His Majesty's Imperial Forces, but this shall not prevent\r\nthe construction or maintenance by the Government of the Irish Free State\r\nof such vessels as are necessary for the protection of the Revenue or the\r\nFisheries.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing provisions of this article shall be reviewed at a conference\r\nof Representatives of the British and Irish Governments to be held at the\r\nexpiration of five years from the date hereof with a view to the\r\nundertaking by Ireland of a share in her own coastal defence.\r\n\r\n7.

The ports of Great Britain and the Irish Free State shall be freely\r\nopen to the ships of the other country on payment of the customary port\r\nand other dues.\r\n\r\n10.

If before the expiration of the said month, an address is presented to\r\nHis Majesty by both Houses of the Parliament of Northern Ireland to that\r\neffect, the powers of the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free\r\nState shall no longer extend to Northern Ireland, and the provisions of\r\nthe Government of Ireland Act, 1920 (including those relating to the\r\nCouncil of Ireland), shall so far as they relate to Northern Ireland,\r\ncontinue to be of full force and effect, and this instrument shall have\r\neffect subject to the necessary modifications.\r\n\r\nProvided that if such an address is so presented a Commission consisting\r\nof three persons, one to be appointed by the Government of the Irish Free\r\nState, one to be appointed by the Government of Northern Ireland and one\r\nwho shall be Chairman to be appointed by the British Government shall\r\ndetermine in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants, so far as may\r\nbe compatible with economic and geographic conditions the boundaries\r\nbetween Northern Ireland and the rest of Ireland, and for the purposes of\r\nthe Government of Ireland Act, 1920, and of this instrument, the boundary\r\nof Northern Ireland shall be such as may be determined by such Commission.\r\n\r\n13.

After the expiration of the said month, if no such address as is\r\nmentioned in Article 12 hereof is presented, the Parliament and Government\r\nof Northern Ireland shall continue to exercise as respects Northern\r\nIreland the powers conferred on them by the Government of Ireland Act,\r\n1920, but the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State shall in\r\nNorthern Ireland have in relation to matters in respect of which the\r\nParliament of Northern Ireland has not power to make laws under that Act\r\n(including matters which under the said Act are within the jurisdiction of\r\nthe Council of Ireland) the same powers as in the rest of Ireland subject\r\nto such other provisions as may be agreed in manner hereinafter appearing.\r\n\r\n15. At any time after the date hereof the Government of Northern Ireland\r\nand the provisional Government of Southern Ireland hereinafter constituted\r\nmay meet for the purpose of discussing the provisions subject to which the\r\nlast foregoing Article is to operate in the event of no such address as is\r\ntherein mentioned being presented and those provisions may include:--\r\n\r\n     (_a_) Safeguards with regard to patronage in Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) Safeguards with regard to the collection of revenue in Northern\r\n     Ireland.\r\n\r\n     (_c_) Safeguards with regard to import and export duties affecting\r\n     the trade or industry of Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\n     (_d_) Safeguards for minorities in Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\n     (_e_) The settlement of the financial relations between Northern\r\n     Ireland and the Irish Free State.\r\n\r\n     (_f_) The establishment and powers of a local militia in Northern\r\n     Ireland and the relation of the Defence Forces of the Irish Free\r\n     State and of Northern Ireland respectively.\r\n\r\nand if at any such meeting provisions are agreed to, the same shall have\r\neffect as if they were included amongst the provisions subject to which\r\nthe powers of the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State are\r\nto be exercisable in Northern Ireland under Article 14 hereof.\r\n\r\n16. Neither the Parliament of the Irish Free State nor the Parliament of\r\nNorthern Ireland shall make any law so as either directly or indirectly to\r\nendow any religion or prohibit or restrict the free exercise thereof or\r\ngive any preference or impose any disability on account of religious\r\nbelief or religious status or affect prejudicially the right of any child\r\nto attend a school receiving public money without attending the religious\r\ninstruction at the school or make any discrimination as respects State aid\r\nbetween schools under the management of different religious denominations\r\nor divert from any religious denomination or any educational institution\r\nany of its property except for public utility purposes and on payment of\r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\n17.

But this arrangement\r\nshall not continue in force beyond the expiration of twelve months from\r\nthe date hereof.\r\n\r\n18.
