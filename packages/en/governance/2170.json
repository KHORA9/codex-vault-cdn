Even if I estimated their\r\noratorical merit much more highly than I do, I should not willingly have\r\nrevived, in the quiet times in which we are so happy as to live, the\r\nmemory of those fierce contentions in which too many years of my public\r\nlife were passed. Many expressions which, when society was convulsed\r\nby political dissensions, and when the foundations of government were\r\nshaking, were heard by an excited audience with sympathy and applause,\r\nmay, now that the passions of all parties have subsided, be thought\r\nintemperate and acrimonious. It was especially painful to me to find\r\nmyself under the necessity of recalling to my own recollection, and to\r\nthe recollection of others, the keen encounters which took place between\r\nthe late Sir Robert Peel and myself. Some parts of the conduct of that\r\neminent man I must always think deserving of serious blame. But, on a\r\ncalm review of his long and chequered public life, I acknowledge, with\r\nsincere pleasure, that his faults were much more than redeemed by great\r\nvirtues, great sacrifices, and great services. My political hostility to\r\nhim was never in the smallest degree tainted by personal ill-will. After\r\nhis fall from power a cordial reconciliation took place between us: I\r\nadmired the wisdom, the moderation, the disinterested patriotism, which\r\nhe invariably showed during the last and best years of his life; I\r\nlamented his untimely death, as both a private and a public calamity;\r\nand I earnestly wished that the sharp words which had sometimes been\r\nexchanged between us might be forgotten.\r\n\r\nUnhappily an act, for which the law affords no redress, but which I\r\nhave no hesitation in pronouncing to be a gross injury to me and a gross\r\nfraud on the public, has compelled me to do what I should never have\r\ndone willingly. A bookseller, named Vizetelly, who seems to aspire to\r\nthat sort of distinction which Curll enjoyed a hundred and twenty years\r\nago, thought fit, without asking my consent, without even giving me any\r\nnotice, to announce an edition of my Speeches, and was not ashamed to\r\ntell the world in his advertisement that he published them by special\r\nlicense. When the book appeared, I found that it contained fifty-six\r\nspeeches, said to have been delivered by me in the House of Commons. Of\r\nthese speeches a few were reprinted from reports which I had corrected\r\nfor the Mirror of Parliament or the Parliamentary Debates, and were\r\ntherefore, with the exception of some errors of the pen and the press,\r\ncorrectly given. The rest bear scarcely the faintest resemblance to\r\nthe speeches which I really made. The substance of what I said\r\nis perpetually misrepresented. The connection of the arguments is\r\naltogether lost. Extravagant blunders are put into my mouth in almost\r\nevery page. An editor who was not grossly ignorant would have perceived\r\nthat no person to whom the House of Commons would listen could possibly\r\nhave been guilty of such blunders. An editor who had the smallest\r\nregard for truth, or for the fame of the person whose speeches he had\r\nundertaken to publish, would have had recourse to the various sources of\r\ninformation which were readily accessible, and, by collating them, would\r\nhave produced a book which would at least have contained no absolute\r\nnonsense. But I have unfortunately had an editor whose only object was\r\nto make a few pounds, and who was willing to sacrifice to that object my\r\nreputation and his own. He took the very worst report extant, compared\r\nit with no other report, removed no blemish however obvious or however\r\nludicrous, gave to the world some hundreds of pages utterly contemptible\r\nboth in matter and manner, and prefixed my name to them. The least that\r\nhe should have done was to consult the files of The Times newspaper.\r\nI have frequently done so, when I have noticed in his book any passage\r\nmore than ordinarily absurd; and I have almost invariably found that\r\nin The Times newspaper, my meaning had been correctly reported, though\r\noften in words different from those which I had used.\r\n\r\nI could fill a volume with instances of the injustice with which I have\r\nbeen treated. But I will confine myself to a single speech, the speech\r\non the Dissenters' Chapels Bill. I have selected that speech, not\r\nbecause Mr Vizetelly's version of that speech is worse than his versions\r\nof thirty or forty other speeches, but because I have before me a report\r\nof that speech which an honest and diligent editor would have thought it\r\nhis first duty to consult. The report of which I speak was published by\r\nthe Unitarian Dissenters, who were naturally desirous that there should\r\nbe an accurate record of what had passed in a debate deeply interesting\r\nto them. It was not corrected by me: but it generally, though not\r\nuniformly, exhibits with fidelity the substance of what I said.\r\n\r\nMr Vizetelly makes me say that the principle of our Statutes of\r\nLimitation was to be found in the legislation of the Mexicans and\r\nPeruvians. That is a matter about which, as I know nothing, I certainly\r\nsaid nothing. Neither in The Times nor in the Unitarian report is there\r\nanything about Mexico or Peru.\r\n\r\nMr Vizetelly next makes me say that the principle of limitation is found\r\n\"amongst the Pandects of the Benares.\" Did my editor believe that I\r\nuttered these words, and that the House of Commons listened patiently\r\nto them? If he did, what must be thought of his understanding? If he did\r\nnot, was it the part of an honest man to publish such gibberish as mine?\r\nThe most charitable supposition, which I therefore gladly adopt, is\r\nthat Mr Vizetelly saw nothing absurd in the expression which he has\r\nattributed to me. The Benares he probably supposes to be some Oriental\r\nnation. What he supposes their Pandects to be I shall not presume to\r\nguess. If he had examined The Times, he would have found no trace of the\r\npassage. The reporter, probably, did not catch what I said, and, being\r\nmore veracious than Mr Vizetelly, did not choose to ascribe to me what\r\nI did not say. If Mr Vizetelly had consulted the Unitarian report, he\r\nwould have seen that I spoke of the Pundits of Benares; and he might,\r\nwithout any very long or costly research, have learned where Benares is,\r\nand what a Pundit is.\r\n\r\nMr Vizetelly then represents me as giving the House of Commons some very\r\nextraordinary information about both the Calvinistic and the Arminian\r\nMethodists. He makes me say that Whitfield held and taught that the\r\nconnection between Church and State was sinful. Whitfield never held\r\nor taught any such thing; nor was I so grossly ignorant of the life and\r\ncharacter of that remarkable man as to impute to him a doctrine which he\r\nwould have abhorred. Here again, both in The Times and in the Unitarian\r\nreport, the substance of what I said is correctly given.\r\n\r\nMr Vizetelly proceeds to put into my mouth a curious account of the\r\npolity of the Wesleyan Methodists. He makes me say that, after John\r\nWesley's death, \"the feeling in favour of the lay administration of the\r\nSacrament became very strong and very general: a Conference was applied\r\nfor, was constituted, and, after some discussion, it was determined that\r\nthe request should be granted.\" Such folly could have been uttered only\r\nby a person profoundly ignorant of the history of Methodism. Certainly\r\nnothing of the sort was ever uttered by me; and nothing of the sort will\r\nbe found either in The Times or in the Unitarian report.\r\n\r\nMr Vizetelly makes me say that the Great Charter recognises the\r\nprinciple of limitation, a thing which everybody who has read the Great\r\nCharter knows not to be true. He makes me give an utterly false history\r\nof Lord Nottingham's Occasional Conformity Bill. But I will not weary\r\nmy readers by proceeding further. These samples will probably be thought\r\nsufficient. They all lie within a compass of seven or eight pages. It\r\nwill be observed that all the faults which I have pointed out are grave\r\nfaults of substance. Slighter faults of substance are numerous. As to\r\nfaults of syntax and of style, hardly one sentence in a hundred is free\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\nI cannot permit myself to be exhibited, in this ridiculous and degrading\r\nmanner, for the profit of an unprincipled man. I therefore unwillingly,\r\nand in mere self-defence, give this volume to the public. I have\r\nselected, to the best of my judgment, from among my speeches, those\r\nwhich are the least unworthy to be preserved. Nine of them were\r\ncorrected by me while they were still fresh in my memory, and appear\r\nalmost word for word as they were spoken. They are the speech of the\r\nsecond of March 1831, the speech of the twentieth of September 1831,\r\nthe speech of the tenth of October 1831, the speech of the sixteenth of\r\nDecember 1831, the speech on the Anatomy Bill, the speech on the India\r\nBill, the speech on Serjeant Talfourd's Copyright Bill, the speech on\r\nthe Sugar Duties, and the speech on the Irish Church. The substance of\r\nthe remaining speeches I have given with perfect ingenuousness. I have\r\nnot made alterations for the purpose of saving my own reputation either\r\nfor consistency or for foresight. I have not softened down the strong\r\nterms in which I formerly expressed opinions which time and thought may\r\nhave modified; nor have I retouched my predictions in order to make them\r\ncorrespond with subsequent events. Had I represented myself as speaking\r\nin 1831, in 1840, or in 1845, as I should speak in 1853, I should have\r\ndeprived my book of its chief value. This volume is now at least a\r\nstrictly honest record of opinions and reasonings which were heard\r\nwith favour by a large part of the Commons of England at some important\r\nconjunctures; and such a record, however low it may stand in the\r\nestimation of the literary critic, cannot but be of use to the\r\nhistorian.\r\n\r\nI do not pretend to give with accuracy the diction of those speeches\r\nwhich I did not myself correct within a week after they were delivered.\r\nMany expressions, and a few paragraphs, linger in my memory. But\r\nthe rest, including much that had been carefully premeditated, is\r\nirrecoverably lost. Nor have I, in this part of my task, derived much\r\nassistance from any report. My delivery is, I believe, too rapid. Very\r\nable shorthand writers have sometimes complained that they could not\r\nfollow me, and have contented themselves with setting down the substance\r\nof what I said. As I am unable to recall the precise words which I used,\r\nI have done my best to put my meaning into words which I might have\r\nused.\r\n\r\nI have only, in conclusion, to beg that the readers of this Preface will\r\npardon an egotism which a great wrong has made necessary, and which is\r\nquite as disagreeable to myself as it can be to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nParliamentary Reform.

(MARCH 2, 1831) A SPEECH DELIVERED IN THE HOUSE OF\r\nCOMMONS ON THE 2D OF MARCH, 1831.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the first of March, 1831, Lord John Russell moved the House\r\nof Commons for leave to bring in a bill to amend the representation of\r\nthe people in England and Wales. The discussion occupied seven nights.\r\nAt length, on the morning of Thursday, the tenth of March, the motion\r\nwas carried without a division. The following speech was made on the\r\nsecond night of the debate.\r\n\r\nIt is a circumstance, Sir, of happy augury for the motion before\r\nthe House, that almost all those who have opposed it have declared\r\nthemselves hostile on principle to Parliamentary Reform. Two Members,\r\nI think, have confessed that, though they disapprove of the plan now\r\nsubmitted to us, they are forced to admit the necessity of a change in\r\nthe Representative system. Yet even those gentleman have used, as far as\r\nI have observed, no arguments which would not apply as strongly to the\r\nmost moderate change as to that which has been proposed by His Majesty's\r\nGovernment. I say, Sir, that I consider this as a circumstance of happy\r\naugury. For what I feared was, not the opposition of those who are\r\naverse to all Reform, but the disunion of reformers. I knew that, during\r\nthree months, every reformer had been employed in conjecturing what the\r\nplan of the Government would be. I knew that every reformer had imagined\r\nin his own mind a scheme differing doubtless in some points from that\r\nwhich my noble friend, the Paymaster of the Forces, has developed. I\r\nfelt therefore great apprehension that one person would be dissatisfied\r\nwith one part of the bill, that another person would be dissatisfied\r\nwith another part, and that thus our whole strength would be wasted in\r\ninternal dissensions. That apprehension is now at an end. I have seen\r\nwith delight the perfect concord which prevails among all who deserve\r\nthe name of reformers in this House; and I trust that I may consider it\r\nas an omen of the concord which will prevail among reformers throughout\r\nthe country. I will not, Sir, at present express any opinion as to the\r\ndetails of the bill; but, having during the last twenty-four hours given\r\nthe most diligent consideration to its general principles, I have no\r\nhesitation in pronouncing it a wise, noble, and comprehensive measure,\r\nskilfully framed for the healing of great distempers, for the securing\r\nat once of the public liberties, and of the public repose, and for the\r\nreconciling and knitting together of all the orders of the State.\r\n\r\nThe honourable Baronet who has just sat down (Sir John Walsh.), has\r\ntold us, that the Ministers have attempted to unite two inconsistent\r\nprinciples in one abortive measure. Those were his very words. He\r\nthinks, if I understand him rightly, that we ought either to leave\r\nthe representative system such as it is, or to make it perfectly\r\nsymmetrical. I think, Sir, that the Ministers would have acted unwisely\r\nif they had taken either course. Their principle is plain, rational, and\r\nconsistent. It is this, to admit the middle class to a large and\r\ndirect share in the representation, without any violent shock to the\r\ninstitutions of our country. I understand those cheers: but surely the\r\ngentlemen who utter them will allow that the change which will be made\r\nin our institutions by this bill is far less violent than that which,\r\naccording to the honourable Baronet, ought to be made if we make any\r\nReform at all. I praise the Ministers for not attempting, at the present\r\ntime, to make the representation uniform. I praise them for not effacing\r\nthe old distinction between the towns and the counties, and for not\r\nassigning Members to districts, according to the American practice, by\r\nthe Rule of Three. The Government has, in my opinion, done all that was\r\nnecessary for the removing of a great practical evil, and no more than\r\nwas necessary.\r\n\r\nI consider this, Sir, as a practical question. I rest my opinion on\r\nno general theory of government. I distrust all general theories of\r\ngovernment. I will not positively say, that there is any form of polity\r\nwhich may not, in some conceivable circumstances, be the best possible.\r\nI believe that there are societies in which every man may safely be\r\nadmitted to vote. Gentlemen may cheer, but such is my opinion. I say,\r\nSir, that there are countries in which the condition of the labouring\r\nclasses is such that they may safely be intrusted with the right of\r\nelecting Members of the Legislature. If the labourers of England were\r\nin that state in which I, from my soul, wish to see them, if employment\r\nwere always plentiful, wages always high, food always cheap, if a large\r\nfamily were considered not as an encumbrance but as a blessing, the\r\nprincipal objections to Universal Suffrage would, I think, be removed.\r\nUniversal Suffrage exists in the United States, without producing any\r\nvery frightful consequences; and I do not believe that the people of\r\nthose States, or of any part of the world, are in any good quality\r\nnaturally superior to our own countrymen. But, unhappily, the labouring\r\nclasses in England, and in all old countries, are occasionally in a\r\nstate of great distress. Some of the causes of this distress are, I\r\nfear, beyond the control of the Government. We know what effect distress\r\nproduces, even on people more intelligent than the great body of the\r\nlabouring classes can possibly be. We know that it makes even wise men\r\nirritable, unreasonable, credulous, eager for immediate relief, heedless\r\nof remote consequences. There is no quackery in medicine, religion, or\r\npolitics, which may not impose even on a powerful mind, when that mind\r\nhas been disordered by pain or fear. It is therefore no reflection\r\non the poorer class of Englishmen, who are not, and who cannot in the\r\nnature of things be, highly educated, to say that distress produces on\r\nthem its natural effects, those effects which it would produce on the\r\nAmericans, or on any other people, that it blinds their judgment, that\r\nit inflames their passions, that it makes them prone to believe those\r\nwho flatter them, and to distrust those who would serve them. For the\r\nsake, therefore, of the whole society, for the sake of the labouring\r\nclasses themselves, I hold it to be clearly expedient that, in a\r\ncountry like this, the right of suffrage should depend on a pecuniary\r\nqualification.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, every argument which would induce me to oppose Universal\r\nSuffrage, induces me to support the plan which is now before us. I am\r\nopposed to Universal Suffrage, because I think that it would produce a\r\ndestructive revolution. I support this plan, because I am sure that it\r\nis our best security against a revolution. The noble Paymaster of the\r\nForces hinted, delicately indeed and remotely, at this subject. He spoke\r\nof the danger of disappointing the expectations of the nation; and for\r\nthis he was charged with threatening the House. Sir, in the year 1817,\r\nthe late Lord Londonderry proposed a suspension of the Habeas Corpus\r\nAct. On that occasion he told the House that, unless the measures which\r\nhe recommended were adopted, the public peace could not be preserved.\r\nWas he accused of threatening the House? Again, in the year 1819, he\r\nproposed the laws known by the name of the Six Acts. He then told\r\nthe House that, unless the executive power were reinforced, all the\r\ninstitutions of the country would be overturned by popular violence. Was\r\nhe then accused of threatening the House? Will any gentleman say that\r\nit is parliamentary and decorous to urge the danger arising from popular\r\ndiscontent as an argument for severity; but that it is unparliamentary\r\nand indecorous to urge that same danger as an argument for conciliation?\r\nI, Sir, do entertain great apprehension for the fate of my country. I do\r\nin my conscience believe that, unless the plan proposed, or some similar\r\nplan, be speedily adopted, great and terrible calamities will befall us.\r\nEntertaining this opinion, I think myself bound to state it, not as a\r\nthreat, but as a reason. I support this bill because it will improve our\r\ninstitutions; but I support it also because it tends to preserve them.\r\nThat we may exclude those whom it is necessary to exclude, we must admit\r\nthose whom it may be safe to admit. At present we oppose the schemes of\r\nrevolutionists with only one half, with only one quarter of our proper\r\nforce. We say, and we say justly, that it is not by mere numbers, but\r\nby property and intelligence, that the nation ought to be governed. Yet,\r\nsaying this, we exclude from all share in the government great masses\r\nof property and intelligence, great numbers of those who are most\r\ninterested in preserving tranquillity, and who know best how to preserve\r\nit. We do more. We drive over to the side of revolution those whom we\r\nshut out from power. Is this a time when the cause of law and order can\r\nspare one of its natural allies?\r\n\r\nMy noble friend, the Paymaster of the Forces, happily described the\r\neffect which some parts of our representative system would produce\r\non the mind of a foreigner, who had heard much of our freedom and\r\ngreatness. If, Sir, I wished to make such a foreigner clearly understand\r\nwhat I consider as the great defects of our system, I would conduct\r\nhim through that immense city which lies to the north of Great Russell\r\nStreet and Oxford Street, a city superior in size and in population to\r\nthe capitals of many mighty kingdoms; and probably superior in opulence,\r\nintelligence, and general respectability, to any city in the world. I\r\nwould conduct him through that interminable succession of streets and\r\nsquares, all consisting of well built and well furnished houses. I\r\nwould make him observe the brilliancy of the shops, and the crowd of\r\nwell-appointed equipages. I would show him that magnificent circle of\r\npalaces which surrounds the Regent's Park. I would tell him that the\r\nrental of this district was far greater than that of the whole kingdom\r\nof Scotland, at the time of the Union. And then I would tell him that\r\nthis was an unrepresented district. It is needless to give any more\r\ninstances. It is needless to speak of Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds,\r\nSheffield, with no representation, or of Edinburgh and Glasgow with a\r\nmock representation. If a property tax were now imposed on the principle\r\nthat no person who had less than a hundred and fifty pounds a year\r\nshould contribute, I should not be surprised to find that one half in\r\nnumber and value of the contributors had no votes at all; and it would,\r\nbeyond all doubt, be found that one fiftieth part in number and value of\r\nthe contributors had a larger share of the representation than the\r\nother forty-nine fiftieths. This is not government by property. It\r\nis government by certain detached portions and fragments of property,\r\nselected from the rest, and preferred to the rest, on no rational\r\nprinciple whatever.\r\n\r\nTo say that such a system is ancient, is no defence. My honourable\r\nfriend, the Member for the University of Oxford (Sir Robert Harry\r\nInglis.), challenges us to show that the Constitution was ever better\r\nthan it is. Sir, we are legislators, not antiquaries. The question for\r\nus is, not whether the Constitution was better formerly, but whether we\r\ncan make it better now. In fact, however, the system was not in ancient\r\ntimes by any means so absurd as it is in our age. One noble Lord (Lord\r\nStormont.) has to-night told us that the town of Aldborough, which he\r\nrepresents, was not larger in the time of Edward the First than it is at\r\npresent. The line of its walls, he assures us, may still be traced. It\r\nis now built up to that line. He argues, therefore, that as the founders\r\nof our representative institutions gave members to Aldborough when it\r\nwas as small as it now is, those who would disfranchise it on account\r\nof its smallness have no right to say that they are recurring to the\r\noriginal principle of our representative institutions. But does the\r\nnoble Lord remember the change which has taken place in the country\r\nduring the last five centuries? Does he remember how much England has\r\ngrown in population, while Aldborough has been standing still? Does\r\nhe consider, that in the time of Edward the First, the kingdom did not\r\ncontain two millions of inhabitants? It now contains nearly fourteen\r\nmillions. A hamlet of the present day would have been a town of some\r\nimportance in the time of our early Parliaments. Aldborough may be\r\nabsolutely as considerable a place as ever. But compared with the\r\nkingdom, it is much less considerable, by the noble Lord's own showing,\r\nthan when it first elected burgesses. My honourable friend, the Member\r\nfor the University of Oxford, has collected numerous instances of the\r\ntyranny which the kings and nobles anciently exercised, both over this\r\nHouse and over the electors. It is not strange that, in times\r\nwhen nothing was held sacred, the rights of the people, and of the\r\nrepresentatives of the people, should not have been held sacred. The\r\nproceedings which my honourable friend has mentioned, no more prove\r\nthat, by the ancient constitution of the realm, this House ought to be\r\na tool of the king and of the aristocracy, than the Benevolences and the\r\nShipmoney prove their own legality, or than those unjustifiable arrests\r\nwhich took place long after the ratification of the great Charter\r\nand even after the Petition of Right, prove that the subject was not\r\nanciently entitled to his personal liberty. We talk of the wisdom of\r\nour ancestors: and in one respect at least they were wiser than we. They\r\nlegislated for their own times. They looked at the England which was\r\nbefore them. They did not think it necessary to give twice as many\r\nMembers to York as they gave to London, because York had been the\r\ncapital of Britain in the time of Constantius Chlorus; and they would\r\nhave been amazed indeed if they had foreseen, that a city of more than\r\na hundred thousand inhabitants would be left without Representatives in\r\nthe nineteenth century, merely because it stood on ground which in\r\nthe thirteenth century had been occupied by a few huts. They framed\r\na representative system, which, though not without defects and\r\nirregularities, was well adapted to the state of England in their time.\r\nBut a great revolution took place. The character of the old corporations\r\nchanged. New forms of property came into existence. New portions of\r\nsociety rose into importance. There were in our rural districts rich\r\ncultivators, who were not freeholders. There were in our capital rich\r\ntraders, who were not liverymen. Towns shrank into villages. Villages\r\nswelled into cities larger than the London of the Plantagenets.\r\nUnhappily while the natural growth of society went on, the artificial\r\npolity continued unchanged. The ancient form of the representation\r\nremained; and precisely because the form remained, the spirit departed.\r\nThen came that pressure almost to bursting, the new wine in the old\r\nbottles, the new society under the old institutions. It is now time for\r\nus to pay a decent, a rational, a manly reverence to our ancestors, not\r\nby superstitiously adhering to what they, in other circumstances, did,\r\nbut by doing what they, in our circumstances, would have done. All\r\nhistory is full of revolutions, produced by causes similar to those\r\nwhich are now operating in England. A portion of the community which had\r\nbeen of no account expands and becomes strong. It demands a place in the\r\nsystem, suited, not to its former weakness, but to its present power.\r\nIf this is granted, all is well. If this is refused, then comes\r\nthe struggle between the young energy of one class and the ancient\r\nprivileges of another. Such was the struggle between the Plebeians and\r\nthe Patricians of Rome. Such was the struggle of the Italian allies for\r\nadmission to the full rights of Roman citizens. Such was the struggle\r\nof our North American colonies against the mother country. Such was\r\nthe struggle which the Third Estate of France maintained against the\r\naristocracy of birth. Such was the struggle which the Roman Catholics\r\nof Ireland maintained against the aristocracy of creed. Such is the\r\nstruggle which the free people of colour in Jamaica are now maintaining\r\nagainst the aristocracy of skin. Such, finally, is the struggle which\r\nthe middle classes in England are maintaining against an aristocracy\r\nof mere locality, against an aristocracy the principle of which is to\r\ninvest a hundred drunken potwallopers in one place, or the owner of\r\na ruined hovel in another, with powers which are withheld from cities\r\nrenowned to the furthest ends of the earth, for the marvels of their\r\nwealth and of their industry.\r\n\r\nBut these great cities, says my honourable friend the Member for the\r\nUniversity of Oxford, are virtually, though not directly, represented.\r\nAre not the wishes of Manchester, he asks, as much consulted as those\r\nof any town which sends Members to Parliament? Now, Sir, I do not\r\nunderstand how a power which is salutary when exercised virtually can\r\nbe noxious when exercised directly. If the wishes of Manchester have as\r\nmuch weight with us as they would have under a system which should give\r\nRepresentatives to Manchester, how can there be any danger in giving\r\nRepresentatives to Manchester? A virtual Representative is, I presume,\r\na man who acts as a direct Representative would act: for surely it\r\nwould be absurd to say that a man virtually represents the people\r\nof Manchester, who is in the habit of saying No, when a man directly\r\nrepresenting the people of Manchester would say Aye. The utmost that\r\ncan be expected from virtual Representation is that it may be as good\r\nas direct Representation. If so, why not grant direct Representation to\r\nplaces which, as everybody allows, ought, by some process or other, to\r\nbe represented?\r\n\r\nIf it be said that there is an evil in change as change, I answer that\r\nthere is also an evil in discontent as discontent. This, indeed, is the\r\nstrongest part of our case. It is said that the system works well. I\r\ndeny it. I deny that a system works well, which the people regard\r\nwith aversion. We may say here, that it is a good system and a perfect\r\nsystem. But if any man were to say so to any six hundred and fifty-eight\r\nrespectable farmers or shopkeepers, chosen by lot in any part of\r\nEngland, he would be hooted down, and laughed to scorn. Are these the\r\nfeelings with which any part of the government ought to be regarded?\r\nAbove all, are these the feelings with which the popular branch of\r\nthe legislature ought to be regarded? It is almost as essential to the\r\nutility of a House of Commons, that it should possess the confidence of\r\nthe people, as that it should deserve that confidence. Unfortunately,\r\nthat which is in theory the popular part of our government, is in\r\npractice the unpopular part. Who wishes to dethrone the King? Who wishes\r\nto turn the Lords out of their House? Here and there a crazy radical,\r\nwhom the boys in the street point at as he walks along. Who wishes to\r\nalter the constitution of this House? The whole people. It is natural\r\nthat it should be so. The House of Commons is, in the language of Mr\r\nBurke, a check, not on the people, but for the people. While that check\r\nis efficient, there is no reason to fear that the King or the nobles\r\nwill oppress the people. But if the check requires checking, how is it\r\nto be checked? If the salt shall lose its savour, wherewith shall we\r\nseason it? The distrust with which the nation regards this House may\r\nbe unjust. But what then? Can you remove that distrust? That it exists\r\ncannot be denied. That it is an evil cannot be denied. That it is an\r\nincreasing evil cannot be denied. One gentleman tells us that it has\r\nbeen produced by the late events in France and Belgium; another, that\r\nit is the effect of seditious works which have lately been published.\r\nIf this feeling be of origin so recent, I have read history to little\r\npurpose. Sir, this alarming discontent is not the growth of a day or of\r\na year. If there be any symptoms by which it is possible to distinguish\r\nthe chronic diseases of the body politic from its passing inflammations,\r\nall those symptoms exist in the present case. The taint has been\r\ngradually becoming more extensive and more malignant, through the whole\r\nlifetime of two generations. We have tried anodynes. We have tried cruel\r\noperations. What are we to try now? Who flatters himself that he can\r\nturn this feeling back? Does there remain any argument which escaped the\r\ncomprehensive intellect of Mr Burke, or the subtlety of Mr Windham? Does\r\nthere remain any species of coercion which was not tried by Mr Pitt and\r\nby Lord Londonderry? We have had laws. We have had blood. New treasons\r\nhave been created. The Press has been shackled. The Habeas Corpus Act\r\nhas been suspended. Public meetings have been prohibited. The event has\r\nproved that these expedients were mere palliatives. You are at the end\r\nof your palliatives. The evil remains. It is more formidable than ever.\r\nWhat is to be done?\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances, a great plan of reconciliation, prepared by\r\nthe Ministers of the Crown, has been brought before us in a manner which\r\ngives additional lustre to a noble name, inseparably associated during\r\ntwo centuries with the dearest liberties of the English people. I will\r\nnot say, that this plan is in all its details precisely such as I might\r\nwish it to be; but it is founded on a great and a sound principle. It\r\ntakes away a vast power from a few. It distributes that power through\r\nthe great mass of the middle order. Every man, therefore, who thinks as\r\nI think is bound to stand firmly by Ministers who are resolved to\r\nstand or fall with this measure. Were I one of them, I would sooner,\r\ninfinitely sooner, fall with such a measure than stand by any other\r\nmeans that ever supported a Cabinet.\r\n\r\nMy honourable friend, the Member for the University of Oxford, tells us,\r\nthat if we pass this law, England will soon be a republic. The reformed\r\nHouse of Commons will, according to him, before it has sate ten years,\r\ndepose the King, and expel the Lords from their House. Sir, if my\r\nhonourable friend could prove this, he would have succeeded in bringing\r\nan argument for democracy, infinitely stronger than any that is to be\r\nfound in the works of Paine. My honourable friend's proposition is in\r\nfact this: that our monarchical and aristocratical institutions have no\r\nhold on the public mind of England; that these institutions are regarded\r\nwith aversion by a decided majority of the middle class. This, Sir, I\r\nsay, is plainly deducible from his proposition; for he tells us that the\r\nRepresentatives of the middle class will inevitably abolish royalty and\r\nnobility within ten years: and there is surely no reason to think that\r\nthe Representatives of the middle class will be more inclined to a\r\ndemocratic revolution than their constituents. Now, Sir, if I were\r\nconvinced that the great body of the middle class in England look with\r\naversion on monarchy and aristocracy, I should be forced, much against\r\nmy will, to come to this conclusion, that monarchical and aristocratical\r\ninstitutions are unsuited to my country. Monarchy and aristocracy,\r\nvaluable and useful as I think them, are still valuable and useful as\r\nmeans, and not as ends. The end of government is the happiness of\r\nthe people: and I do not conceive that, in a country like this, the\r\nhappiness of the people can be promoted by a form of government in which\r\nthe middle classes place no confidence, and which exists only because\r\nthe middle classes have no organ by which to make their sentiments\r\nknown. But, Sir, I am fully convinced that the middle classes sincerely\r\nwish to uphold the Royal prerogatives and the constitutional rights of\r\nthe Peers. What facts does my honourable friend produce in support of\r\nhis opinion? One fact only; and that a fact which has absolutely nothing\r\nto do with the question. The effect of this Reform, he tells us, would\r\nbe to make the House of Commons allpowerful. It was allpowerful once\r\nbefore, in the beginning of 1649. Then it cut off the head of the King,\r\nand abolished the House of Peers. Therefore, if it again has the supreme\r\npower, it will act in the same manner. Now, Sir, it was not the House of\r\nCommons that cut off the head of Charles the First; nor was the House\r\nof Commons then allpowerful. It had been greatly reduced in numbers by\r\nsuccessive expulsions. It was under the absolute dominion of the army. A\r\nmajority of the House was willing to take the terms offered by the King.\r\nThe soldiers turned out the majority; and the minority, not a sixth part\r\nof the whole House, passed those votes of which my honourable friend\r\nspeaks, votes of which the middle classes disapproved then, and of which\r\nthey disapprove still.\r\n\r\nMy honourable friend, and almost all the gentlemen who have taken the\r\nsame side with him in this Debate, have dwelt much on the utility of\r\nclose and rotten boroughs. It is by means of such boroughs, they tell\r\nus, that the ablest men have been introduced into Parliament. It is\r\ntrue that many distinguished persons have represented places of this\r\ndescription. But, Sir, we must judge of a form of government by its\r\ngeneral tendency, not by happy accidents. Every form of government has\r\nits happy accidents. Despotism has its happy accidents. Yet we are not\r\ndisposed to abolish all constitutional checks, to place an absolute\r\nmaster over us, and to take our chance whether he may be a Caligula or\r\na Marcus Aurelius. In whatever way the House of Commons may be chosen,\r\nsome able men will be chosen in that way who would not be chosen in any\r\nother way. If there were a law that the hundred tallest men in England\r\nshould be Members of Parliament, there would probably be some able men\r\namong those who would come into the House by virtue of this law. If the\r\nhundred persons whose names stand first in the alphabetical list of the\r\nCourt Guide were made Members of Parliament, there would probably be\r\nable men among them. We read in ancient history, that a very able king\r\nwas elected by the neighing of his horse; but we shall scarcely, I\r\nthink, adopt this mode of election. In one of the most celebrated\r\nrepublics of antiquity, Athens, Senators and Magistrates were chosen by\r\nlot; and sometimes the lot fell fortunately. Once, for example, Socrates\r\nwas in office. A cruel and unjust proposition was made by a demagogue.\r\nSocrates resisted it at the hazard of his own life. There is no event in\r\nGrecian history more interesting than that memorable resistance. Yet who\r\nwould have officers appointed by lot, because the accident of the lot\r\nmay have given to a great and good man a power which he would probably\r\nnever have attained in any other way? We must judge, as I said, by\r\nthe general tendency of a system. No person can doubt that a House of\r\nCommons chosen freely by the middle classes, will contain many very able\r\nmen. I do not say, that precisely the same able men who would find\r\ntheir way into the present House of Commons will find their way into\r\nthe reformed House: but that is not the question. No particular man\r\nis necessary to the State. We may depend on it that, if we provide the\r\ncountry with popular institutions, those institutions will provide it\r\nwith great men.\r\n\r\nThere is another objection, which, I think, was first raised by the\r\nhonourable and learned Member for Newport. (Mr Horace Twiss.) He tells\r\nus that the elective franchise is property; that to take it away from\r\na man who has not been judicially convicted of malpractices is robbery;\r\nthat no crime is proved against the voters in the close boroughs; that\r\nno crime is even imputed to them in the preamble of the bill; and that\r\ntherefore to disfranchise them without compensation would be an act of\r\nrevolutionary tyranny. The honourable and learned gentleman has compared\r\nthe conduct of the present Ministers to that of those odious tools of\r\npower, who, towards the close of the reign of Charles the Second, seized\r\nthe charters of the Whig corporations. Now, there was another precedent,\r\nwhich I wonder that he did not recollect, both because it is much more\r\nnearly in point than that to which he referred, and because my noble\r\nfriend, the Paymaster of the Forces, had previously alluded to it. If\r\nthe elective franchise is property, if to disfranchise voters without a\r\ncrime proved, or a compensation given, be robbery, was there ever such\r\nan act of robbery as the disfranchising of the Irish forty-shilling\r\nfreeholders? Was any pecuniary compensation given to them? Is it\r\ndeclared in the preamble of the bill which took away their franchise,\r\nthat they had been convicted of any offence? Was any judicial inquiry\r\ninstituted into their conduct? Were they even accused of any crime? Or\r\nif you say that it was a crime in the electors of Clare to vote for\r\nthe honourable and learned gentleman who now represents the county of\r\nWaterford, was a Protestant freeholder in Louth to be punished for\r\nthe crime of a Catholic freeholder in Clare? If the principle of the\r\nhonourable and learned Member for Newport be sound, the franchise of the\r\nIrish peasant was property. That franchise the Ministers under whom the\r\nhonourable and learned Member held office did not scruple to take away.\r\nWill he accuse those Ministers of robbery? If not, how can he bring such\r\nan accusation against their successors?\r\n\r\nEvery gentleman, I think, who has spoken from the other side of the\r\nHouse, has alluded to the opinions which some of His Majesty's Ministers\r\nformerly entertained on the subject of Reform. It would be officious in\r\nme, Sir, to undertake the defence of gentlemen who are so well able to\r\ndefend themselves. I will only say that, in my opinion, the country will\r\nnot think worse either of their capacity or of their patriotism, because\r\nthey have shown that they can profit by experience, because they have\r\nlearned to see the folly of delaying inevitable changes. There are\r\nothers who ought to have learned the same lesson. I say, Sir, that there\r\nare those who, I should have thought, must have had enough to last them\r\nall their lives of that humiliation which follows obstinate and boastful\r\nresistance to changes rendered necessary by the progress of society, and\r\nby the development of the human mind. Is it possible that those persons\r\ncan wish again to occupy a position which can neither be defended nor\r\nsurrendered with honour? I well remember, Sir, a certain evening in the\r\nmonth of May, 1827. I had not then the honour of a seat in this House;\r\nbut I was an attentive observer of its proceedings. The right honourable\r\nBaronet opposite (Sir Robert Peel), of whom personally I desire to speak\r\nwith that high respect which I feel for his talents and his character,\r\nbut of whose public conduct I must speak with the sincerity required\r\nby my public duty, was then, as he is now, out of office. He had just\r\nresigned the seals of the Home Department, because he conceived that the\r\nrecent ministerial arrangements had been too favourable to the Catholic\r\nclaims. He rose to ask whether it was the intention of the new Cabinet\r\nto repeal the Test and Corporation Acts, and to reform the Parliament.\r\nHe bound up, I well remember, those two questions together; and he\r\ndeclared that, if the Ministers should either attempt to repeal the\r\nTest and Corporation Acts, or bring forward a measure of Parliamentary\r\nReform, he should think it his duty to oppose them to the utmost. Since\r\nthat declaration was made four years have elapsed; and what is now the\r\nstate of the three questions which then chiefly agitated the minds of\r\nmen? What is become of the Test and Corporation Acts? They are repealed.\r\nBy whom? By the right honourable Baronet. What has become of the\r\nCatholic disabilities? They are removed. By whom? By the right\r\nhonourable Baronet. The question of Parliamentary Reform is still\r\nbehind. But signs, of which it is impossible to misconceive the import,\r\ndo most clearly indicate that unless that question also be speedily\r\nsettled, property, and order, and all the institutions of this great\r\nmonarchy, will be exposed to fearful peril. Is it possible that\r\ngentlemen long versed in high political affairs cannot read these signs?\r\nIs it possible that they can really believe that the Representative\r\nsystem of England, such as it now is, will last to the year 1860? If\r\nnot, for what would they have us wait? Would they have us wait merely\r\nthat we may show to all the world how little we have profited by our own\r\nrecent experience?--Would they have us wait, that we may once again hit\r\nthe exact point where we can neither refuse with authority, nor\r\nconcede with grace? Would they have us wait, that the numbers of the\r\ndiscontented party may become larger, its demands higher, its feelings\r\nmore acrimonious, its organisation more complete? Would they have us\r\nwait till the whole tragicomedy of 1827 has been acted over again?\r\ntill they have been brought into office by a cry of 'No Reform,' to be\r\nreformers, as they were once before brought into office by a cry of\r\n'No Popery,' to be emancipators? Have they obliterated from their\r\nminds--gladly, perhaps, would some among them obliterate from their\r\nminds--the transactions of that year? And have they forgotten all the\r\ntransactions of the succeeding year? Have they forgotten how the spirit\r\nof liberty in Ireland, debarred from its natural outlet, found a vent\r\nby forbidden passages? Have they forgotten how we were forced to indulge\r\nthe Catholics in all the license of rebels, merely because we chose\r\nto withhold from them the liberties of subjects? Do they wait for\r\nassociations more formidable than that of the Corn Exchange, for\r\ncontributions larger than the Rent, for agitators more violent than\r\nthose who, three years ago, divided with the King and the Parliament\r\nthe sovereignty of Ireland? Do they wait for that last and most dreadful\r\nparoxysm of popular rage, for that last and most cruel test of military\r\nfidelity? Let them wait, if their past experience shall induce them to\r\nthink that any high honour or any exquisite pleasure is to be obtained\r\nby a policy like this. Let them wait, if this strange and fearful\r\ninfatuation be indeed upon them, that they should not see with their\r\neyes, or hear with their ears, or understand with their heart. But let\r\nus know our interest and our duty better. Turn where we may, within,\r\naround, the voice of great events is proclaiming to us, Reform, that\r\nyou may preserve. Now, therefore, while everything at home and abroad\r\nforebodes ruin to those who persist in a hopeless struggle against the\r\nspirit of the age, now, while the crash of the proudest throne of the\r\nContinent is still resounding in our ears, now, while the roof of a\r\nBritish palace affords an ignominious shelter to the exiled heir of\r\nforty kings, now, while we see on every side ancient institutions\r\nsubverted, and great societies dissolved, now, while the heart of\r\nEngland is still sound, now, while old feelings and old associations\r\nretain a power and a charm which may too soon pass away, now, in this\r\nyour accepted time, now, in this your day of salvation, take counsel,\r\nnot of prejudice, not of party spirit, not of the ignominious pride of\r\na fatal consistency, but of history, of reason, of the ages which are\r\npast, of the signs of this most portentous time. Pronounce in a\r\nmanner worthy of the expectation with which this great debate has been\r\nanticipated, and of the long remembrance which it will leave behind.\r\nRenew the youth of the State. Save property, divided against itself.\r\nSave the multitude, endangered by its own unpopular power. Save the\r\ngreatest, and fairest, and most highly civilised community that ever\r\nexisted, from calamities which may in a few days sweep away all the rich\r\nheritage of so many ages of wisdom and glory. The danger is terrible.\r\nThe time is short. If this bill should be rejected, I pray to God that\r\nnone of those who concur in rejecting it may ever remember their votes\r\nwith unavailing remorse, amidst the wreck of laws, the confusion of\r\nranks, the spoliation of property, and the dissolution of social order.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARLIAMENTARY REFORM. (JULY 5, 1831) A SPEECH DELIVERED IN THE HOUSE OF\r\nCOMMONS ON THE 5TH OF JULY 1831.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the fourth of July, 1831, Lord John Russell moved the second\r\nreading of the Bill to amend the representation of the people in England\r\nand Wales. Sir John Walsh, member for Sudbury, moved, as an amendment,\r\nthat the bill should be read that day six months. After a discussion,\r\nwhich lasted three nights, the amendment was rejected by 367 votes to\r\n231, and the original motion was carried. The following Speech was made\r\non the second night of the debate.\r\n\r\nNobody, Sir, who has watched the course of the debate can have failed to\r\nobserve that the gentlemen who oppose this bill have chiefly relied on\r\na preliminary objection, which it is necessary to clear away before we\r\nproceed to examine whether the proposed changes in our representative\r\nsystem would or would not be improvements. The elective franchise,\r\nwe are told, is private property. It belongs to this freeman, to that\r\npotwalloper, to the owner of this house, to the owner of that old wall;\r\nand you have no more right to take it away without compensation than to\r\nconfiscate the dividends of a fundholder or the rents of a landholder.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, I admit that, if this objection be well founded, it is\r\ndecisive against the plan of Reform which has been submitted to us. If\r\nthe franchise be really private property, we have no more right to take\r\nmembers away from Gatton because Gatton is small, and to give them to\r\nManchester because Manchester is large, than Cyrus, in the old story,\r\nhad to take away the big coat from the little boy and to put it on the\r\nbig boy. In no case, and under no pretext however specious, would I take\r\naway from any member of the community anything which is of the nature\r\nof property, without giving him full compensation. But I deny that the\r\nelective franchise is of the nature of property; and I believe that, on\r\nthis point, I have with me all reason, all precedent, and all authority.\r\nThis at least is certain, that, if disfranchisement really be robbery,\r\nthe representative system which now exists is founded on robbery. How\r\nwas the franchise in the English counties fixed? By the act of Henry\r\nthe Sixth, which disfranchised tens of thousands of electors who had not\r\nforty shilling freeholds. Was that robbery? How was the franchise in\r\nthe Irish counties fixed? By the act of George the Fourth, which\r\ndisfranchised tens of thousands of electors who had not ten pound\r\nfreeholds. Was that robbery? Or was the great parliamentary reform made\r\nby Oliver Cromwell ever designated as robbery, even by those who most\r\nabhorred his name? Everybody knows that the unsparing manner in which he\r\ndisfranchised small boroughs was emulously applauded, by royalists, who\r\nhated him for having pulled down one dynasty, and by republicans, who\r\nhated him for having founded another. Take Sir Harry Vane and Lord\r\nClarendon, both wise men, both, I believe, in the main, honest men, but\r\nas much opposed to each other in politics as wise and honest men\r\ncould be. Both detested Oliver; yet both approved of Oliver's plan of\r\nparliamentary reform. They grieved only that so salutary a change should\r\nhave been made by an usurper. Vane wished it to have been made by the\r\nRump; Clarendon wished it to be made by the King. Clarendon's language\r\non this subject is most remarkable. For he was no rash innovator.\r\nThe bias of his mind was altogether on the side of antiquity and\r\nprescription. Yet he describes that great disfranchisement of boroughs\r\nas an improvement fit to be made in a more warrantable method and at a\r\nbetter time. This is that better time. What Cromwell attempted to effect\r\nby an usurped authority, in a country which had lately been convulsed\r\nby civil war, and which was with difficulty kept in a state of sullen\r\ntranquillity by military force, it has fallen to our lot to accomplish\r\nin profound peace, and under the rule of a prince whose title is\r\nunquestioned, whose office is reverenced, and whose person is beloved.\r\nIt is easy to conceive with what scorn and astonishment Clarendon would\r\nhave heard it said that the reform which seemed to him so obviously just\r\nand reasonable that he praised it, even when made by a regicide, could\r\nnot, without the grossest iniquity, be made even by a lawful King and a\r\nlawful Parliament.\r\n\r\nSir, in the name of the institution of property, of that great\r\ninstitution, for the sake of which, chiefly, all other institutions\r\nexist, of that great institution to which we owe all knowledge, all\r\ncommerce, all industry, all civilisation, all that makes us to differ\r\nfrom the tattooed savages of the Pacific Ocean, I protest against the\r\npernicious practice of ascribing to that which is not property the\r\nsanctity which belongs to property alone. If, in order to save political\r\nabuses from that fate with which they are threatened by the public\r\nhatred, you claim for them the immunities of property, you must expect\r\nthat property will be regarded with some portion of the hatred which is\r\nexcited by political abuses. You bind up two very different things, in\r\nthe hope that they may stand together. Take heed that they do not fall\r\ntogether. You tell the people that it is as unjust to disfranchise a\r\ngreat lord's nomination borough as to confiscate his estate. Take heed\r\nthat you do not succeed in convincing weak and ignorant minds that there\r\nis no more injustice in confiscating his estate than in disfranchising\r\nhis borough. That this is no imaginary danger, your own speeches in this\r\ndebate abundantly prove. You begin by ascribing to the franchises of Old\r\nSarum the sacredness of property; and you end, naturally enough, I\r\nmust own, by treating the rights of property as lightly as I should be\r\ninclined to treat the franchises of Old Sarum. When you are reminded\r\nthat you voted, only two years ago, for disfranchising great numbers of\r\nfreeholders in Ireland, and when you are asked how, on the principles\r\nwhich you now profess, you can justify that vote, you answer very\r\ncoolly, \"no doubt that was confiscation. No doubt we took away from the\r\npeasants of Munster and Connaught, without giving them a farthing of\r\ncompensation, that which was as much their property as their pigs or\r\ntheir frieze coats. But we did it for the public good. We were pressed\r\nby a great State necessity.\" Sir, if that be an answer, we too may plead\r\nthat we too have the public good in view, and that we are pressed by a\r\ngreat State necessity. But I shall resort to no such plea. It fills me\r\nwith indignation and alarm to hear grave men avow what they own to be\r\ndownright robbery, and justify that robbery on the ground of political\r\nconvenience. No, Sir, there is one way, and only one way, in which those\r\ngentlemen who voted for the disfranchising Act of 1829 can clear their\r\nfame. Either they have no defence, or their defence must be this;\r\nthat the elective franchise is not of the nature of property, and that\r\ntherefore disfranchisement is not spoliation.\r\n\r\nHaving disposed, as I think, of the question of right, I come to the\r\nquestion of expediency. I listened, Sir, with much interest and pleasure\r\nto a noble Lord who spoke for the first time in this debate. (Lord\r\nPorchester.) But I must own that he did not succeed in convincing me\r\nthat there is any real ground for the fears by which he is tormented.\r\nHe gave us a history of France since the Restoration. He told us of the\r\nviolent ebbs and flows of public feeling in that country. He told us\r\nthat the revolutionary party was fast rising to ascendency while M. De\r\nCazes was minister; that then came a violent reaction in favour of the\r\nmonarchy and the priesthood; that then the revolutionary party again\r\nbecame dominant; that there had been a change of dynasty; and that the\r\nChamber of Peers had ceased to be a hereditary body. He then predicted,\r\nif I understood him rightly, that, if we pass this bill, we shall\r\nsuffer all that France has suffered; that we shall have violent contests\r\nbetween extreme parties, a revolution, and an abolition of the House of\r\nLords. I might, perhaps, dispute the accuracy of some parts of the noble\r\nLord's narrative. But I deny that his narrative, accurate or inaccurate,\r\nis relevant. I deny that there is any analogy between the state of\r\nFrance and the state of England. I deny that there is here any\r\ngreat party which answers either to the revolutionary or to the\r\ncounter-revolutionary party in France. I most emphatically deny that\r\nthere is any resemblance in the character, and that there is likely to\r\nbe any resemblance in the fate, of the two Houses of Peers. I always\r\nregarded the hereditary Chamber established by Louis the Eighteenth\r\nas an institution which could not last. It was not in harmony with the\r\nstate of property; it was not in harmony with the public feeling; it\r\nhad neither the strength which is derived from wealth, nor the strength\r\nwhich is derived from prescription. It was despised as plebeian by\r\nthe ancient nobility. It was hated as patrician by the democrats. It\r\nbelonged neither to the old France nor to the new France. It was a mere\r\nexotic transplanted from our island. Here it had struck its roots deep,\r\nand having stood during ages, was still green and vigorous. But it\r\nlanguished in the foreign soil and the foreign air, and was blown\r\ndown by the first storm. It will be no such easy task to uproot the\r\naristocracy of England.\r\n\r\nWith much more force, at least with much more plausibility, the noble\r\nLord and several other members on the other side of the House have\r\nargued against the proposed Reform on the ground that the existing\r\nsystem has worked well. How great a country, they say, is ours! How\r\neminent in wealth and knowledge, in arts and arms! How much admired! How\r\nmuch envied! Is it possible to believe that we have become what we are\r\nunder a bad government! And, if we have a good government, why alter\r\nit? Now, Sir, I am very far from denying that England is great, and\r\nprosperous, and highly civilised. I am equally far from denying that she\r\nowes much of her greatness, of her prosperity, and of her civilisation\r\nto her form of government. But is no nation ever to reform its\r\ninstitutions because it has made great progress under those\r\ninstitutions? Why, Sir, the progress is the very thing which makes the\r\nreform absolutely necessary. The Czar Peter, we all know, did much for\r\nRussia. But for his rude genius and energy, that country might have\r\nstill been utterly barbarous. Yet would it be reasonable to say that\r\nthe Russian people ought always, to the end of time, to be despotically\r\ngoverned, because the Czar Peter was a despot? Let us remember that the\r\ngovernment and the society act and react on each other. Sometimes\r\nthe government is in advance of the society, and hurries the society\r\nforward. So urged, the society gains on the government, comes up with\r\nthe government, outstrips the government, and begins to insist that the\r\ngovernment shall make more speed. If the government is wise, it will\r\nyield to that just and natural demand. The great cause of revolutions\r\nis this, that while nations move onward, constitutions stand still. The\r\npeculiar happiness of England is that here, through many generations,\r\nthe constitution has moved onward with the nation. Gentlemen have told\r\nus, that the most illustrious foreigners have, in every age, spoken\r\nwith admiration of the English constitution. Comines, they say, in the\r\nfifteenth century, extolled the English constitution as the best in the\r\nworld. Montesquieu, in the eighteenth century, extolled it as the best\r\nin the world. And would it not be madness in us to throw away what\r\nsuch men thought the most precious of all our blessings? But was the\r\nconstitution which Montesquieu praised the same with the constitution\r\nwhich Comines praised? No, Sir; if it had been so, Montesquieu never\r\nwould have praised it. For how was it possible that a polity which\r\nexactly suited the subjects of Edward the Fourth should have exactly\r\nsuited the subjects of George the Second? The English have, it is true,\r\nlong been a great and a happy people. But they have been great and happy\r\nbecause their history has been the history of a succession of timely\r\nreforms. The Great Charter, the assembling of the first House of\r\nCommons, the Petition of Right, the Declaration of Right, the Bill which\r\nis now on our table, what are they all but steps in one great progress?\r\nTo every one of those steps the same objections might have been made\r\nwhich we heard to-night, \"You are better off than your neighbours are.\r\nYou are better off than your fathers were. Why can you not leave well\r\nalone?\"\r\n\r\nHow copiously might a Jacobite orator have harangued on this topic\r\nin the Convention of 1688! \"Why make a change of dynasty? Why trouble\r\nourselves to devise new securities for our laws and liberties? See what\r\na nation we are. See how population and wealth have increased since what\r\nyou call the good old times of Queen Elizabeth. You cannot deny that the\r\ncountry has been more prosperous under the kings of the House of Stuart\r\nthan under any of their predecessors. Keep that House, then, and be\r\nthankful.\" Just such is the reasoning of the opponents of this\r\nbill. They tell us that we are an ungrateful people, and that, under\r\ninstitutions from which we have derived inestimable benefits, we are\r\nmore discontented than the slaves of the Dey of Tripoli. Sir, if we had\r\nbeen slaves of the Dey of Tripoli, we should have been too much sunk\r\nin intellectual and moral degradation to be capable of the rational and\r\nmanly discontent of freemen. It is precisely because our institutions\r\nare so good that we are not perfectly contended with them; for they have\r\neducated us into a capacity for enjoying still better institutions. That\r\nthe English Government has generally been in advance of almost all other\r\ngovernments is true. But it is equally true that the English nation is,\r\nand has during some time been, in advance of the English Government. One\r\nplain proof of this is, that nothing is so ill made in our island as\r\nthe laws. In all those things which depend on the intelligence, the\r\nknowledge, the industry, the energy of individuals, or of voluntary\r\ncombinations of individuals, this country stands pre-eminent among all\r\nthe countries of the world, ancient and modern. But in those things\r\nwhich it belongs to the State to direct, we have no such claim to\r\nsuperiority. Our fields are cultivated with a skill unknown elsewhere,\r\nwith a skill which has extorted rich harvests from moors and morasses.\r\nOur houses are filled with conveniences which the kings of former times\r\nmight have envied. Our bridges, our canals, our roads, our modes of\r\ncommunication, fill every stranger with wonder. Nowhere are manufactures\r\ncarried to such perfection. Nowhere is so vast a mass of mechanical\r\npower collected. Nowhere does man exercise such a dominion over matter.\r\nThese are the works of the nation. Compare them with the works of the\r\nrulers of the nation. Look at the criminal law, at the civil law, at the\r\nmodes of conveying lands, at the modes of conducting actions. It is by\r\nthese things that we must judge of our legislators, just as we judge\r\nof our manufacturers by the cotton goods and the cutlery which they\r\nproduce, just as we judge of our engineers by the suspension bridges,\r\nthe tunnels, the steam carriages which they construct. Is, then,\r\nthe machinery by which justice is administered framed with the same\r\nexquisite skill which is found in other kinds of machinery? Can there\r\nbe a stronger contrast than that which exists between the beauty, the\r\ncompleteness, the speed, the precision with which every process is\r\nperformed in our factories, and the awkwardness, the rudeness, the\r\nslowness, the uncertainty of the apparatus by which offences are\r\npunished and rights vindicated? Look at the series of penal statutes,\r\nthe most bloody and the most inefficient in the world, at the puerile\r\nfictions which make every declaration and every plea unintelligible both\r\nto plaintiff and defendant, at the mummery of fines and recoveries, at\r\nthe chaos of precedents, at the bottomless pit of Chancery. Surely we\r\nsee the barbarism of the thirteenth century and the highest civilisation\r\nof the nineteenth century side by side; and we see that the barbarism\r\nbelongs to the government, and the civilisation to the people.\r\n\r\nThis is a state of things which cannot last. If it be not terminated by\r\nwisdom, it will be terminated by violence. A time has come at which it\r\nis not merely desirable, but indispensable to the public safety, that\r\nthe government should be brought into harmony with the people; and it\r\nis because this bill seems to me likely to bring the government into\r\nharmony with the people, that I feel it to be my duty to give my hearty\r\nsupport to His Majesty's Ministers.\r\n\r\nWe have been told, indeed, that this is not the plan of Reform which the\r\nnation asked for. Be it so. But you cannot deny that it is the plan of\r\nReform which the nation has accepted. That, though differing in many\r\nrespects from what was asked, it has been accepted with transports\r\nof joy and gratitude, is a decisive proof of the wisdom of timely\r\nconcession. Never in the history of the world was there so signal an\r\nexample of that true statesmanship, which, at once animating and gently\r\ncurbing the honest enthusiasm of millions, guides it safely and steadily\r\nto a happy goal. It is not strange, that when men are refused what is\r\nreasonable, they should demand what is unreasonable. It is not strange\r\nthat, when they find that their opinion is contemned and neglected by\r\nthe Legislature, they should lend a too favourable ear to worthless\r\nagitators. We have seen how discontent may be produced. We have seen,\r\ntoo, how it may be appeased. We have seen that the true source of the\r\npower of demagogues is the obstinacy of rulers, and that a liberal\r\nGovernment makes a conservative people. Early in the last session, the\r\nFirst Minister of the Crown declared that he would consent to no\r\nReform; that he thought our representative system, just as it stood, the\r\nmasterpiece of human wisdom; that, if he had to make it anew, he would\r\nmake it such as it was, with all its represented ruins and all its\r\nunrepresented cities. What followed? Everything was tumult and panic.\r\nThe funds fell. The streets were insecure. Men's hearts failed them for\r\nfear. We began to move our property into German investments and American\r\ninvestments. Such was the state of the public mind, that it was not\r\nthought safe to let the Sovereign pass from his palace to the Guildhall\r\nof his capital. What part of his kingdom is there in which His Majesty\r\nnow needs any other guard than the affection of his loving subjects?\r\nThere are, indeed, still malecontents; and they may be divided into two\r\nclasses, the friends of corruption and the sowers of sedition. It is\r\nnatural that all who directly profit by abuses, and all who profit by\r\nthe disaffection which abuses excite, should be leagued together against\r\na bill which, by making the government pure, will make the nation loyal.\r\nThere is, and always has been, a real alliance between the two extreme\r\nparties in this country. They play into each other's hands. They live\r\nby each other. Neither would have any influence if the other were taken\r\naway. The demagogue would have no audience but for the indignation\r\nexcited among the multitude by the insolence of the enemies of Reform:\r\nand the last hope of the enemies of Reform is in the uneasiness excited\r\namong all who have anything to lose by the ravings of the demagogue.\r\nI see, and glad I am to see, that the nation perfectly understands and\r\njustly appreciates this coalition between those who hate all liberty and\r\nthose who hate all order. England has spoken, and spoken out. From her\r\nmost opulent seaports, from her manufacturing towns, from her capital\r\nand its gigantic suburbs, from almost every one of her counties, has\r\ngone forth a voice, answering in no doubtful or faltering accent to that\r\ntruly royal voice which appealed on the twenty-second of last April to\r\nthe sense of the nation.\r\n\r\nSo clearly, indeed, has the sense of the nation been expressed, that\r\nscarcely any person now ventures to declare himself hostile to all\r\nReform. We are, it seems, a House of Reformers. Those very gentlemen\r\nwho, a few months ago, were vehement against all change, now own that\r\nsome change may be proper, may be necessary. They assure us that their\r\nopposition is directed, not against Parliamentary Reform, but against\r\nthe particular plan which is now before us, and that a Tory Ministry\r\nwould devise a much better plan. I cannot but think that these tactics\r\nare unskilful. I cannot but think that, when our opponents defended the\r\nexisting system in every part, they occupied a stronger position than\r\nat present. As my noble friend the Paymaster-General said, they have\r\ncommitted an error resembling that of the Scotch army at Dunbar. They\r\nhave left the high ground from which we might have had some difficulty\r\nin dislodging them. They have come down to low ground, where they are at\r\nour mercy. Surely, as Cromwell said, surely the Lord hath delivered them\r\ninto our hand.\r\n\r\nFor, Sir, it is impossible not to perceive that almost every argument\r\nwhich they have urged against this Reform Bill may be urged with equal\r\nforce, or with greater force, against any Reform Bill which they can\r\nthemselves bring in.\r\n\r\nFirst take, what, indeed, are not arguments, but wretched substitutes\r\nfor arguments, those vague terms of reproach, which have been so\r\nlargely employed, here and elsewhere, by our opponents; revolutionary,\r\nanarchical, traitorous, and so forth. It will, I apprehend, hardly be\r\ndisputed that these epithets can be just as easily applied to one Reform\r\nBill as to another.\r\n\r\nBut, you say, intimidation has been used to promote the passing of this\r\nbill; and it would be disgraceful, and of evil example, that Parliament\r\nshould yield to intimidation. But surely, if that argument be of any\r\nforce against the present bill, it will be of tenfold force against any\r\nReform Bill proposed by you. For this bill is the work of men who are\r\nReformers from conscientious conviction, of men, some of whom were\r\nReformers when Reformer was a name of reproach, of men, all of whom were\r\nReformers before the nation had begun to demand Reform in imperative and\r\nmenacing tones. But you are notoriously Reformers merely from fear. You\r\nare Reformers under duress. If a concession is to be made to the public\r\nimportunity, you can hardly deny that it will be made with more grace\r\nand dignity by Lord Grey than by you.\r\n\r\nThen you complain of the anomalies of the bill. One county, you say,\r\nwill have twelve members; and another county, which is larger and more\r\npopulous, will have only ten. Some towns, which are to have only one\r\nmember, are more considerable than other towns which are to have two. Do\r\nthose who make these objections, objections which by the by will be more\r\nin place when the bill is in committee, seriously mean to say that a\r\nTory Reform Bill will leave no anomalies in the representative system?\r\nFor my own part, I trouble myself not at all about anomalies, considered\r\nmerely as anomalies. I would not take the trouble of lifting up my hand\r\nto get rid of an anomaly that was not also a grievance. But if gentlemen\r\nhave such a horror of anomalies, it is strange that they should so long\r\nhave persisted in upholding a system made up of anomalies far greater\r\nthan any that can be found in this bill (a cry of \"No!\"). Yes; far\r\ngreater. Answer me, if you can; but do not interrupt me. On this point,\r\nindeed, it is much easier to interrupt than to answer. For who can\r\nanswer plain arithmetical demonstration? Under the present system,\r\nManchester, with two hundred thousand inhabitants, has no members. Old\r\nSarum, with no inhabitants, has two members. Find me such an anomaly in\r\nthe schedules which are now on the table. But is it possible that you,\r\nthat Tories, can seriously mean to adopt the only plan which can remove\r\nall anomalies from the representative system? Are you prepared to\r\nhave, after every decennial census, a new distribution of members\r\namong electoral districts? Is your plan of Reform that which Mr Canning\r\nsatirised as the most crazy of all the projects of the disciples of Tom\r\nPaine? Do you really mean\r\n\r\n     \"That each fair burgh, numerically free,\r\n     Shall choose its members by the rule of three?\"\r\n\r\nIf not, let us hear no more of the anomalies of the Reform Bill.\r\n\r\nBut your great objection to this bill is that it will not be final. I\r\nask you whether you think that any Reform Bill which you can frame will\r\nbe final? For my part I do believe that the settlement proposed by His\r\nMajesty's Ministers will be final, in the only sense in which a wise man\r\never uses that word. I believe that it will last during that time\r\nfor which alone we ought at present to think of legislating. Another\r\ngeneration may find in the new representative system defects such as we\r\nfind in the old representative system. Civilisation will proceed. Wealth\r\nwill increase. Industry and trade will find out new seats. The same\r\ncauses which have turned so many villages into great towns, which\r\nhave turned so many thousands of square miles of fir and heath into\r\ncornfields and orchards, will continue to operate. Who can say that a\r\nhundred years hence there may not be, on the shore of some desolate\r\nand silent bay in the Hebrides, another Liverpool, with its docks and\r\nwarehouses and endless forests of masts? Who can say that the huge\r\nchimneys of another Manchester may not rise in the wilds of Connemara?\r\nFor our children we do not pretend to legislate. All that we can do\r\nfor them is to leave to them a memorable example of the manner in which\r\ngreat reforms ought to be made. In the only sense, therefore, in which\r\na statesman ought to say that anything is final, I pronounce this bill\r\nfinal. But in what sense will your bill be final? Suppose that you could\r\ndefeat the Ministers, that you could displace them, that you could\r\nform a Government, that you could obtain a majority in this House,\r\nwhat course would events take? There is no difficulty in foreseeing\r\nthe stages of the rapid progress downward. First we should have a mock\r\nreform; a Bassietlaw reform; a reform worthy of those politicians who,\r\nwhen a delinquent borough had forfeited its franchise, and when it was\r\nnecessary for them to determine what they would do with two seats\r\nin Parliament, deliberately gave those seats, not to Manchester or\r\nBirmingham or Leeds, not to Lancashire or Staffordshire or Devonshire,\r\nbut to a constituent body studiously selected because it was not large\r\nand because it was not independent; a reform worthy of those politicians\r\nwho, only twelve months ago, refused to give members to the three\r\ngreatest manufacturing towns in the world. We should have a reform which\r\nwould produce all the evils and none of the benefits of change, which\r\nwould take away from the representative system the foundation of\r\nprescription, and yet would not substitute the surer foundation of\r\nreason and public good. The people would be at once emboldened and\r\nexasperated; emboldened because they would see that they had frightened\r\nthe Tories into making a pretence of reforming the Parliament; and\r\nexasperated because they would see that the Tory Reform was a mere\r\npretence. Then would come agitation, tumult, political associations,\r\nlibels, inflammatory harangues. Coercion would only aggravate the\r\nevil. This is no age, this is no country, for the war of power against\r\nopinion. Those Jacobin mountebanks, whom this bill would at once send\r\nback to their native obscurity, would rise into fearful importance. The\r\nlaw would be sometimes braved and sometimes evaded. In short, England\r\nwould soon be what Ireland was at the beginning of 1829. Then, at\r\nlength, as in 1829, would come the late and vain repentance. Then, Sir,\r\namidst the generous cheers of the Whigs, who will be again occupying\r\ntheir old seats on your left hand, and amidst the indignant murmurs of\r\nthose stanch Tories who are now again trusting to be again betrayed, the\r\nright honourable Baronet opposite will rise from the Treasury Bench to\r\npropose that bill on which the hearts of the people are set. But will\r\nthat bill be then accepted with the delight and thankfulness with which\r\nit was received last March? Remember Ireland. Remember how, in that\r\ncountry, concessions too long delayed were at last received. That great\r\nboon which in 1801, in 1813, in 1825, would have won the hearts of\r\nmillions, given too late, and given from fear, only produced new\r\nclamours and new dangers. Is not one such lesson enough for one\r\ngeneration? A noble Lord opposite told us not to expect that this bill\r\nwill have a conciliatory effect. Recollect, he said, how the French\r\naristocracy surrendered their privileges in 1789, and how that surrender\r\nwas requited. Recollect that Day of Sacrifices which was afterwards\r\ncalled the Day of Dupes. Sir, that day was afterwards called the Day of\r\nDupes, not because it was the Day of Sacrifices, but because it was\r\nthe Day of Sacrifices too long deferred. It was because the French\r\naristocracy resisted reform in 1783, that they were unable to resist\r\nrevolution in 1789. It was because they clung too long to odious\r\nexemptions and distinctions, that they were at last unable to serve\r\ntheir lands, their mansions, their heads. They would not endure Turgot:\r\nand they had to endure Robespierre.\r\n\r\nI am far indeed from wishing that the Members of this House should be\r\ninfluenced by fear in the bad and unworthy sense of that word. But\r\nthere is an honest and honourable fear, which well becomes those who are\r\nintrusted with the dearest interests of a great community; and to that\r\nfear I am not ashamed to make an earnest appeal. It is very well to talk\r\nof confronting sedition boldly, and of enforcing the law against those\r\nwho would disturb the public peace. No doubt a tumult caused by local\r\nand temporary irritation ought to be suppressed with promptitude and\r\nvigour. Such disturbances, for example, as those which Lord George\r\nGordon raised in 1780, should be instantly put down with the strong\r\nhand. But woe to the Government which cannot distinguish between a\r\nnation and a mob! Woe to the Government which thinks that a great, a\r\nsteady, a long continued movement of the public mind is to be stopped\r\nlike a street riot! This error has been twice fatal to the great House\r\nof Bourbon. God be praised, our rulers have been wiser. The golden\r\nopportunity which, if once suffered to escape, might never have been\r\nretrieved, has been seized. Nothing, I firmly believe, can now prevent\r\nthe passing of this noble law, this second Bill of Rights. [\"Murmurs.\"]\r\nYes, I call it, and the nation calls it, and our posterity will long\r\ncall it, this second Bill of Rights, this Greater Charter of the\r\nLiberties of England. The year 1831 will, I trust, exhibit the first\r\nexample of the manner in which it behoves a free and enlightened people\r\nto purify their polity from old and deeply seated abuses, without\r\nbloodshed, without violence, without rapine, all points freely debated,\r\nall the forms of senatorial deliberation punctiliously observed,\r\nindustry and trade not for a moment interrupted, the authority of law\r\nnot for a moment suspended. These are things of which we may well be\r\nproud. These are things which swell the heart up with a good hope for\r\nthe destinies of mankind. I cannot but anticipate a long series of\r\nhappy years; of years during which a parental Government will be firmly\r\nsupported by a grateful nation: of years during which war, if war should\r\nbe inevitable, will find us an united people; of years pre-eminently\r\ndistinguished by the progress of arts, by the improvement of laws,\r\nby the augmentation of the public resources, by the diminution of the\r\npublic burdens, by all those victories of peace, in which, far more than\r\nin any military successes, consists the true felicity of states, and the\r\ntrue glory of statesmen. With such hopes, Sir, and such feelings, I give\r\nmy cordial assent to the second reading of a bill which I consider as\r\nin itself deserving of the warmest approbation, and as indispensably\r\nnecessary, in the present temper of the public mind, to the repose of\r\nthe country and to the stability of the throne.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARLIAMENTARY REFORM. (SEPTEMBER 20, 1831) A SPEECH DELIVERED IN THE\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS ON THE 20TH OF SEPTEMBER 1831.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the nineteenth of September, 1831, the Bill to amend the\r\nrepresentation of the people in England and Wales was read a third time,\r\nat an early hour and in a thin house, without any debate. But on the\r\nquestion whether the Bill should pass a discussion arose which lasted\r\nthree nights. On the morning of the twenty-second of September the House\r\ndivided; and the Bill passed by 345 votes to 236. The following Speech\r\nwas made on the second night of the debate.\r\n\r\nIt is not without great diffidence, Sir, that I rise to address you on a\r\nsubject which has been nearly exhausted. Indeed, I should not have risen\r\nhad I not thought that, though the arguments on this question are for\r\nthe most part old, our situation at present is in a great measure new.\r\nAt length the Reform Bill, having passed without vital injury\r\nthrough all the dangers which threatened it, during a long and minute\r\ndiscussion, from the attacks of its enemies and from the dissensions\r\nof its friends, comes before us for our final ratification, altered,\r\nindeed, in some of its details for the better, and in some for the\r\nworse, but in its great principles still the same bill which, on the\r\nfirst of March, was proposed to the late Parliament, the same bill which\r\nwas received with joy and gratitude by the whole nation, the same bill\r\nwhich, in an instant, took away the power of interested agitators, and\r\nunited in one firm body all the sects of sincere Reformers, the same\r\nbill which, at the late election, received the approbation of almost\r\nevery great constituent body in the empire. With a confidence which\r\ndiscussion has only strengthened, with an assured hope of great public\r\nblessings if the wish of the nation shall be gratified, with a deep and\r\nsolemn apprehension of great public calamities if that wish shall be\r\ndisappointed, I, for the last time, give my most hearty assent to this\r\nnoble law, destined, I trust, to be the parent of many good laws, and,\r\nthrough a long series of years, to secure the repose and promote the\r\nprosperity of my country.\r\n\r\nWhen I say that I expect this bill to promote the prosperity of the\r\ncountry, I by no means intend to encourage those chimerical hopes which\r\nthe honourable and learned Member for Rye (Mr Pemberton.), who has so\r\nmuch distinguished himself in this debate, has imputed to the Reformers.\r\nThe people, he says, are for the bill, because they expect that it will\r\nimmediately relieve all their distresses. Sir, I believe that very few\r\nof that large and respectable class which we are now about to admit to\r\na share of political power entertain any such absurd expectation. They\r\nexpect relief, I doubt not; and I doubt not that they will find it:\r\nbut sudden relief they are far too wise to expect. The bill, says the\r\nhonourable and learned gentleman, is good for nothing: it is merely\r\ntheoretical: it removes no real and sensible evil: it will not give the\r\npeople more work, or higher wages, or cheaper bread. Undoubtedly, Sir,\r\nthe bill will not immediately give all those things to the people.\r\nBut will any institutions give them all those things? Do the present\r\ninstitutions of the country secure to them those advantages? If we are\r\nto pronounce the Reform Bill good for nothing, because it will not at\r\nonce raise the nation from distress to prosperity, what are we to say\r\nof that system under which the nation has been of late sinking from\r\nprosperity into distress? The defect is not in the Reform Bill, but in\r\nthe very nature of government. On the physical condition of the great\r\nbody of the people, government acts not as a specific, but as an\r\nalternative. Its operation is powerful, indeed, and certain, but gradual\r\nand indirect. The business of government is not directly to make the\r\npeople rich; and a government which attempts more than this is precisely\r\nthe government which is likely to perform less. Governments do not and\r\ncannot support the people. We have no miraculous powers: we have not the\r\nrod of the Hebrew lawgiver: we cannot rain down bread on the multitude\r\nfrom Heaven: we cannot smite the rock and give them to drink. We can\r\ngive them only freedom to employ their industry to the best advantage,\r\nand security in the enjoyment of what their industry has acquired. These\r\nadvantages it is our duty to give at the smallest possible cost. The\r\ndiligence and forethought of individuals will thus have fair play; and\r\nit is only by the diligence and forethought of individuals that the\r\ncommunity can become prosperous. I am not aware that His Majesty's\r\nMinisters, or any of the supporters of this bill, have encouraged the\r\npeople to hope, that Reform will remove distress, in any other way than\r\nby this indirect process. By this indirect process the bill will, I\r\nfeel assured, conduce to the national prosperity. If it had been\r\npassed fifteen years ago, it would have saved us from our present\r\nembarrassments. If we pass it now, it will gradually extricate us from\r\nthem. It will secure to us a House of Commons, which, by preserving\r\npeace, by destroying monopolies, by taking away unnecessary public\r\nburthens, by judiciously distributing necessary public burthens, will,\r\nin the progress of time, greatly improve our condition. This it will do;\r\nand those who blame it for not doing more blame it for not doing what\r\nno Constitution, no code of laws, ever did or ever will do; what\r\nno legislator, who was not an ignorant and unprincipled quack, ever\r\nventured to promise.\r\n\r\nBut chimerical as are the hopes which the honourable and learned Member\r\nfor Rye imputes to the people, they are not, I think, more chimerical\r\nthan the fears which he has himself avowed. Indeed, those very gentlemen\r\nwho are constantly telling us that we are taking a leap in the dark,\r\nthat we pay no attention to the lessons of experience, that we are mere\r\ntheorists, are themselves the despisers of experience, are themselves\r\nthe mere theorists. They are terrified at the thought of admitting into\r\nParliament members elected by ten pound householders. They have formed\r\nin their own imaginations a most frightful idea of these members. My\r\nhonourable and learned friend, the Member for Cockermouth (Sir James\r\nScarlett.), is certain that these members will take every opportunity of\r\npromoting the interests of the journeyman in opposition to those of the\r\ncapitalist. The honourable and learned Member for Rye is convinced\r\nthat none but persons who have strong local connections, will ever be\r\nreturned for such constituent bodies. My honourable friend, the Member\r\nfor Thetford (Mr Alexander Baring.), tells us, that none but mob\r\norators, men who are willing to pay the basest court to the multitude,\r\nwill have any chance. Other speakers have gone still further, and\r\nhave described to us the future borough members as so many Marats and\r\nSanterres, low, fierce, desperate men, who will turn the House into a\r\nbear-garden, and who will try to turn the monarchy into a republic, mere\r\nagitators, without honour, without sense, without education, without the\r\nfeelings or the manners of gentlemen. Whenever, during the course of the\r\nfatiguing discussions by which we have been so long occupied, there has\r\nbeen a cry of \"question,\" or a noise at the bar, the orator who has been\r\ninterrupted has remarked, that such proceedings will be quite in place\r\nin the Reformed Parliament, but that we ought to remember that the House\r\nof Commons is still an assembly of gentlemen. This, I say, is to set up\r\nmere theory, or rather mere prejudice, in opposition to long and ample\r\nexperience. Are the gentlemen who talk thus ignorant that we have\r\nalready the means of judging what kind of men the ten pound householders\r\nwill send up to parliament? Are they ignorant that there are even now\r\nlarge towns with very popular franchises, with franchises even more\r\ndemocratic than those which will be bestowed by the present bill?\r\nOught they not, on their own principles, to look at the results of\r\nthe experiments which have already been made, instead of predicting\r\nfrightful calamities at random? How do the facts which are before us\r\nagree with their theories? Nottingham is a city with a franchise even\r\nmore democratic than that which this bill establishes. Does Nottingham\r\nsend hither mere vulgar demagogues? It returns two distinguished men,\r\none an advocate, the other a soldier, both unconnected with the town.\r\nEvery man paying scot and lot has a vote at Leicester. This is a lower\r\nfranchise than the ten pound franchise. Do we find that the Members\r\nfor Leicester are the mere tools of the journeymen? I was at Leicester\r\nduring the contest of 1826; and I recollect that the suffrages of the\r\nscot and lot voters were pretty equally divided between two candidates,\r\nneither of them connected with the place, neither of them a slave of the\r\nmob, one a Tory Baronet from Derbyshire, the other a most respectable\r\nand excellent friend of mine, connected with the manufacturing\r\ninterest, and also an inhabitant of Derbyshire. Look at Norwich. Look at\r\nNorthampton, with a franchise more democratic than even the scot and lot\r\nfranchise. Northampton formerly returned Mr Perceval, and now returns\r\ngentlemen of high respectability, gentlemen who have a great stake in\r\nthe prosperity and tranquillity of the country. Look at the metropolitan\r\ndistricts. This is an a fortiori case. Nay it is--the expression, I\r\nfear, is awkward--an a fortiori case at two removes. The ten pound\r\nhouseholders of the metropolis are persons in a lower station of\r\nlife than the ten pound householders of other towns. The scot and lot\r\nfranchise in the metropolis is again lower than the ten pound franchise.\r\nYet have Westminster and Southwark been in the habit of sending us\r\nmembers of whom we have had reason to be ashamed, of whom we have not\r\nhad reason to be proud? I do not say that the inhabitants of Westminster\r\nand Southwark have always expressed their political sentiments with\r\nproper moderation. That is not the question. The question is this: what\r\nkind of men have they elected? The very principle of all Representative\r\ngovernment is, that men who do not judge well of public affairs may be\r\nquite competent to choose others who will judge better. Whom, then, have\r\nWestminster and Southwark sent us during the last fifty years, years\r\nfull of great events, years of intense popular excitement? Take any one\r\nof those nomination boroughs, the patrons of which have conscientiously\r\nendeavoured to send fit men into this House. Compare the Members for\r\nthat borough with the Members for Westminster and Southwark; and you\r\nwill have no doubt to which the preference is due. It is needless to\r\nmention Mr Fox, Mr Sheridan, Mr Tierney, Sir Samuel Romilly. Yet I must\r\npause at the name of Sir Samuel Romilly. Was he a mob orator? Was he a\r\nservile flatterer of the multitude? Sir, if he had any fault, if\r\nthere was any blemish on that most serene and spotless character, that\r\ncharacter which every public man, and especially every professional\r\nman engaged in politics, ought to propose to himself as a model, it\r\nwas this, that he despised popularity too much and too visibly. The\r\nhonourable Member for Thetford told us that the honourable and learned\r\nMember for Rye, with all his talents, would have no chance of a seat in\r\nthe Reformed Parliament, for want of the qualifications which succeed\r\non the hustings. Did Sir Samuel Romilly ever appear on the hustings of\r\nWestminster? He never solicited one vote; he never showed himself to the\r\nelectors, till he had been returned at the head of the poll. Even\r\nthen, as I have heard from one of his nearest relatives, it was with\r\nreluctance that he submitted to be chaired. He shrank from being made\r\na show. He loved the people, and he served them; but Coriolanus himself\r\nwas not less fit to canvass them. I will mention one other name, that\r\nof a man of whom I have only a childish recollection, but who must have\r\nbeen intimately known to many of those who hear me, Mr Henry Thornton.\r\nHe was a man eminently upright, honourable, and religious, a man of\r\nstrong understanding, a man of great political knowledge; but, in all\r\nrespects, the very reverse of a mob orator. He was a man who would not\r\nhave yielded to what he considered as unreasonable clamour, I will\r\nnot say to save his seat, but to save his life. Yet he continued to\r\nrepresent Southwark, Parliament after Parliament, for many years. Such\r\nhas been the conduct of the scot and lot voters of the metropolis; and\r\nthere is clearly less reason to expect democratic violence from ten\r\npound householders than from scot and lot householders; and from ten\r\npound householders in the country towns than from ten pound householders\r\nin London. Experience, I say, therefore, is on our side; and on the side\r\nof our opponents nothing but mere conjecture and mere assertion.\r\n\r\nSir, when this bill was first brought forward, I supported it, not\r\nonly on the ground of its intrinsic merits, but, also, because I was\r\nconvinced that to reject it would be a course full of danger. I believe\r\nthat the danger of that course is in no respect diminished. I believe,\r\non the contrary, that it is increased. We are told that there is a\r\nreaction. The warmth of the public feeling, it seems, has abated. In\r\nthis story both the sections of the party opposed to Reform are agreed;\r\nthose who hate Reform, because it will remove abuses, and those who hate\r\nit, because it will vert anarchy; those who wish to see the electing\r\nbody controlled by ejectments, and those who wish to see it controlled\r\nby riots. They must now, I think, be undeceived. They must have already\r\ndiscovered that the surest way to prevent a reaction is to talk about\r\nit, and that the enthusiasm of the people is at once rekindled by any\r\nindiscreet mention of their seeming coolness. This, Sir, is not the\r\nfirst reaction which the sagacity of the Opposition has discovered since\r\nthe Reform Bill was brought in. Every gentleman who sat in the late\r\nParliament, every gentleman who, during the sitting of the late\r\nParliament, paid attention to political speeches and publications, must\r\nremember how, for some time before the debate on General Gascoyne's\r\nmotion, and during the debate on that motion, and down to the very day\r\nof the dissolution, we were told that public feeling had cooled. The\r\nright honourable Baronet, the member for Tamworth, told us so. All the\r\nliterary organs of the Opposition, from the Quarterly Review down to the\r\nMorning Post, told us so. All the Members of the Opposition with whom\r\nwe conversed in private told us so. I have in my eye a noble friend of\r\nmine, who assured me, on the very night which preceded the dissolution,\r\nthat the people had ceased to be zealous for the Ministerial plan, and\r\nthat we were more likely to lose than to gain by the elections. The\r\nappeal was made to the people; and what was the result? What sign of a\r\nreaction appeared among the Livery of London? What sign of a reaction\r\ndid the honourable Baronet who now represents Okehampton find among the\r\nfreeholders of Cornwall? (Sir Richard Vyvyan.) How was it with the large\r\nrepresented towns? Had Liverpool cooled? or Bristol? or Leicester? or\r\nCoventry? or Nottingham? or Norwich? How was it with the great seats of\r\nmanufacturing industry, Yorkshire, and Lancashire, and Staffordshire,\r\nand Warwickshire, and Cheshire? How was it with the agricultural\r\ndistricts, Northumberland and Cumberland, Leicestershire and\r\nLincolnshire, Kent and Essex, Oxfordshire, Hampshire, Somersetshire,\r\nDorsetshire, Devonshire? How was it with the strongholds of\r\naristocratical influence, Newark, and Stamford, and Hertford, and St\r\nAlban's? Never did any people display, within the limits prescribed by\r\nlaw, so generous a fervour, or so steadfast a determination, as that\r\nvery people whose apparent languor had just before inspired the enemies\r\nof Reform with a delusive hope.\r\n\r\nSuch was the end of the reaction of April; and, if that lesson shall not\r\nprofit those to whom it was given, such and yet more signal will be the\r\nend of the reaction of September. The two cases are strictly analogous.\r\nIn both cases the people were eager when they believed the bill to be\r\nin danger, and quiet when they believed it to be in security. During the\r\nthree or four weeks which followed the promulgation of the Ministerial\r\nplan, all was joy, and gratitude, and vigorous exertion. Everywhere\r\nmeetings were held: everywhere resolutions were passed: from every\r\nquarter were sent up petitions to this House, and addresses to the\r\nThrone: and then the nation, having given vent to its first feelings of\r\ndelight, having clearly and strongly expressed its opinions, having seen\r\nthe principle of the bill adopted by the House of Commons on the second\r\nreading, became composed, and awaited the result with a tranquillity\r\nwhich the Opposition mistook for indifference. All at once the aspect of\r\naffairs changed. General Gascoyne's amendment was carried: the bill was\r\nagain in danger: exertions were again necessary. Then was it well\r\nseen whether the calmness of the public mind was any indication of\r\nindifference. The depth and sincerity of the prevailing sentiments were\r\nproved, not by mere talking, but by actions, by votes, by sacrifices.\r\nIntimidation was defied: expenses were rejected: old ties were broken:\r\nthe people struggled manfully: they triumphed gloriously: they placed\r\nthe bill in perfect security, as far as this house was concerned; and\r\nthey returned to their repose. They are now, as they were on the eve of\r\nGeneral Gascoyne's motion, awaiting the issue of the deliberations of\r\nParliament, without any indecent show of violence, but with anxious\r\ninterest and immovable resolution. And because they are not exhibiting\r\nthat noisy and rapturous enthusiasm which is in its own nature\r\ntransient, because they are not as much excited as on the day when the\r\nplan of the Government was first made known to them, or on the day when\r\nthe late Parliament was dissolved, because they do not go on week after\r\nweek, hallooing, and holding meetings, and marching about with flags,\r\nand making bonfires, and illuminating their houses, we are again told\r\nthat there is a reaction. To such a degree can men be deceived by\r\ntheir wishes, in spite of their own recent experience. Sir, there is no\r\nreaction; and there will be no reaction. All that has been said on this\r\nsubject convinces me only that those who are now, for the second time,\r\nraising this cry, know nothing of the crisis in which they are called on\r\nto act, or of the nation which they aspire to govern. All their opinions\r\nrespecting this bill are founded on one great error. They imagine that\r\nthe public feeling concerning Reform is a mere whim which sprang up\r\nsuddenly out of nothing, and which will as suddenly vanish into nothing.\r\nThey, therefore, confidently expect a reaction. They are always looking\r\nout for a reaction. Everything that they see, or that they hear, they\r\nconstrue into a sign of the approach of this reaction. They resemble the\r\nman in Horace, who lies on the bank of the river, expecting that it\r\nwill every moment pass by and leave him a clear passage, not knowing the\r\ndepth and abundance of the fountain which feeds it, not knowing that\r\nit flows, and will flow on for ever. They have found out a hundred\r\ningenious devices by which they deceive themselves. Sometimes they tell\r\nus that the public feeling about Reform was caused by the events which\r\ntook place at Paris about fourteen months ago; though every observant\r\nand impartial man knows, that the excitement which the late French\r\nrevolution produced in England was not the cause but the effect of that\r\nprogress which liberal opinions had made amongst us. Sometimes they\r\ntell us that we should not have been troubled with any complaints on the\r\nsubject of the Representation, if the House of Commons had agreed to a\r\ncertain motion, made in the session of 1830, for inquiry into the causes\r\nof the public distress. I remember nothing about that motion, except\r\nthat it gave rise to the dullest debate ever known; and the country, I\r\nam firmly convinced, cared not one straw about it. But is it not strange\r\nthat men of real ability can deceive themselves so grossly, as to think\r\nthat any change in the government of a foreign nation, or the rejection\r\nof any single motion, however popular, could all at once raise up a\r\ngreat, rich, enlightened nation, against its ancient institutions? Could\r\nsuch small drops have produced an overflowing, if the vessel had not\r\nalready been filled to the very brim? These explanations are incredible,\r\nand if they were credible, would be anything but consolatory. If it were\r\nreally true that the English people had taken a sudden aversion to a\r\nrepresentative system which they had always loved and admired, because a\r\nsingle division in Parliament had gone against their wishes, or because,\r\nin a foreign country, in circumstances bearing not the faintest analogy\r\nto those in which we are placed, a change of dynasty had happened, what\r\nhope could we have for such a nation of madmen? How could we expect\r\nthat the present form of government, or any form of government, would be\r\ndurable amongst them?\r\n\r\nSir, the public feeling concerning Reform is of no such recent origin,\r\nand springs from no such frivolous causes. Its first faint commencement\r\nmay be traced far, very far, back in our history. During seventy years\r\nthat feeling has had a great influence on the public mind. Through the\r\nfirst thirty years of the reign of George the Third, it was gradually\r\nincreasing. The great leaders of the two parties in the State were\r\nfavourable to Reform. Plans of reform were supported by large and most\r\nrespectable minorities in the House of Commons. The French Revolution,\r\nfilling the higher and middle classes with an extreme dread of change,\r\nand the war calling away the public attention from internal to external\r\npolitics, threw the question back; but the people never lost sight\r\nof it. Peace came, and they were at leisure to think of domestic\r\nimprovements. Distress came, and they suspected, as was natural, that\r\ntheir distress was the effect of unfaithful stewardship and unskilful\r\nlegislation. An opinion favourable to Parliamentary Reform grew up\r\nrapidly, and became strong among the middle classes. But one tie, one\r\nstrong tie, still bound those classes to the Tory party. I mean the\r\nCatholic Question. It is impossible to deny that, on that subject, a\r\nlarge proportion, a majority, I fear, of the middle class of Englishmen,\r\nconscientiously held opinions opposed to those which I have always\r\nentertained, and were disposed to sacrifice every other consideration to\r\nwhat they regarded as a religious duty. Thus the Catholic Question hid,\r\nso to speak, the question of Parliamentary Reform. The feeling in favour\r\nof Parliamentary Reform grew, but it grew in the shade. Every man, I\r\nthink, must have observed the progress of that feeling in his own social\r\ncircle. But few Reform meetings were held, and few petitions in favour\r\nof Reform presented. At length the Catholics were emancipated; the\r\nsolitary link of sympathy which attached the people to the Tories was\r\nbroken; the cry of \"No Popery\" could no longer be opposed to the cry\r\nof \"Reform.\" That which, in the opinion of the two great parties in\r\nParliament, and of a vast portion of the community, had been the first\r\nquestion, suddenly disappeared; and the question of Parliamentary Reform\r\ntook the first place. Then was put forth all the strength which had been\r\ngrowing in silence and obscurity. Then it appeared that Reform had on\r\nits side a coalition of interests and opinions unprecedented in our\r\nhistory, all the liberality and intelligence which had supported the\r\nCatholic claims, and all the clamour which had opposed them.\r\n\r\nThis, I believe, is the true history of that public feeling on the\r\nsubject of Reform which had been ascribed to causes quite inadequate to\r\nthe production of such an effect. If ever there was in the history of\r\nmankind a national sentiment which was the very opposite of a caprice,\r\nwith which accident had nothing to do, which was produced by the slow,\r\nsteady, certain progress of the human mind, it is the sentiment of the\r\nEnglish people on the subject of Reform. Accidental circumstances\r\nmay have brought that feeling to maturity in a particular year, or a\r\nparticular month. That point I will not dispute; for it is not worth\r\ndisputing. But those accidental circumstances have brought on Reform,\r\nonly as the circumstance that, at a particular time, indulgences were\r\noffered for sale in a particular town in Saxony, brought on the great\r\nseparation from the Church of Rome. In both cases the public mind was\r\nprepared to move on the slightest impulse.\r\n\r\nThinking thus of the public opinion concerning Reform, being convinced\r\nthat this opinion is the mature product of time and of discussion, I\r\nexpect no reaction. I no more expect to see my countrymen again content\r\nwith the mere semblance of a Representation, than to see them again\r\ndrowning witches or burning heretics, trying causes by red hot\r\nploughshares, or offering up human sacrifices to wicker idols. I no more\r\nexpect a reaction in favour of Gatton and Old Sarum, than a reaction in\r\nfavour of Thor and Odin. I should think such a reaction almost as much\r\na miracle as that the shadow should go back upon the dial. Revolutions\r\nproduced by violence are often followed by reactions; the victories of\r\nreason once gained, are gained for eternity.\r\n\r\nIn fact, if there be, in the present aspect of public affairs, any sign\r\npeculiarly full of evil omen to the opponents of Reform, it is that very\r\ncalmness of the public mind on which they found their expectation of\r\nsuccess. They think that it is the calmness of indifference. It is the\r\ncalmness of confident hope: and in proportion to the confidence of hope\r\nwill be the bitterness of disappointment. Disappointment, indeed, I\r\ndo not anticipate. That we are certain of success in this House is now\r\nacknowledged; and our opponents have, in consequence, during the whole\r\nof this Session, and particularly during the present debate, addressed\r\ntheir arguments and exhortations rather to the Lords than to the\r\nassembly of which they are themselves Members. Their principal argument\r\nhas always been, that the bill will destroy the peerage. The honourable\r\nand learned Member for Rye has, in plain terms, called on the Barons of\r\nEngland to save their order from democratic encroachments, by rejecting\r\nthis measure. All these arguments, all these appeals, being interpreted,\r\nmean this: \"Proclaim to your countrymen that you have no common\r\ninterests with them, no common sympathies with them; that you can be\r\npowerful only by their weakness, and exalted only by their degradation;\r\nthat the corruption which disgusts them, and the oppression against\r\nwhich their spirit rises up, are indispensable to your authority;\r\nthat the freedom and purity of election are incompatible with the very\r\nexistence of your House. Give them clearly to understand that your\r\npower rests, not as they have hitherto imagined, on their rational\r\nconvictions, or on their habitual veneration, or on your own great\r\nproperty, but on a system fertile of political evils, fertile also of\r\nlow iniquities of which ordinary justice take cognisance. Bind up, in\r\ninseparable union, the privileges of your estate with the grievances\r\nof ours: resolve to stand or fall with abuses visibly marked out for\r\ndestruction: tell the people that they are attacking you in attacking\r\nthe three holes in the wall, and that they shall never get rid of\r\nthe three holes in the wall, till they have got rid of you; that a\r\nhereditary peerage and a representative assembly, can co-exist only in\r\nname, and that, if they will have a real House of Peers, they must be\r\ncontent with a mock House of Commons.\" This, I say, is the advice given\r\nto the Lords by those who call themselves the friends of aristocracy.\r\nThat advice so pernicious will not be followed, I am well assured; yet\r\nI cannot but listen to it with uneasiness. I cannot but wonder that it\r\nshould proceed from the lips of men who are constantly lecturing us on\r\nthe duty of consulting history and experience. Have they never heard\r\nwhat effects counsels like their own, when too faithfully followed, have\r\nproduced? Have they never visited that neighbouring country, which still\r\npresents to the eye, even of a passing stranger, the signs of a great\r\ndissolution and renovation of society? Have they never walked by those\r\nstately mansions, now sinking into decay, and portioned out into lodging\r\nrooms, which line the silent streets of the Faubourg St Germain? Have\r\nthey never seen the ruins of those castles whose terraces and gardens\r\noverhang the Loire? Have they never heard that from those magnificent\r\nhotels, from those ancient castles, an aristocracy as splendid, as\r\nbrave, as proud, as accomplished, as ever Europe saw, was driven forth\r\nto exile and beggary, to implore the charity of hostile Governments and\r\nhostile creeds, to cut wood in the back settlements of America, or to\r\nteach French in the schoolrooms of London? And why were those haughty\r\nnobles destroyed with that utter destruction? Why were they scattered\r\nover the face of the earth, their titles abolished, their escutcheons\r\ndefaced, their parks wasted, their palaces dismantled, their heritage\r\ngiven to strangers? Because they had no sympathy with the people,\r\nno discernment of the signs of their time; because, in the pride and\r\nnarrowness of their hearts, they called those whose warnings might\r\nhave saved them theorists and speculators; because they refused all\r\nconcession till the time had arrived when no concession would avail. I\r\nhave no apprehension that such a fate awaits the nobles of England. I\r\ndraw no parallel between our aristocracy and that of France. Those who\r\nrepresent the peerage as a class whose power is incompatible with the\r\njust influence of the people in the State, draw that parallel, and not\r\nI. They do all in their power to place the Lords and Commons of England\r\nin that position with respect to each other in which the French gentry\r\nstood with respect to the Third Estate. But I am convinced that these\r\nadvisers will not succeed. We see, with pride and delight, among the\r\nfriends of the people, the Talbots, the Cavendishes, the princely house\r\nof Howard. Foremost among those who have entitled themselves, by their\r\nexertions in this House, to the lasting gratitude of their countrymen,\r\nwe see the descendants of Marlborough, of Russell, and of Derby. I hope,\r\nand firmly believe, that the Lords will see what their interests and\r\ntheir honour require. I hope, and firmly believe, that they will act in\r\nsuch a manner as to entitle themselves to the esteem and affection of\r\nthe people. But if not, let not the enemies of Reform imagine that their\r\nreign is straightway to recommence, or that they have obtained anything\r\nmore than a short and uneasy respite. We are bound to respect the\r\nconstitutional rights of the Peers; but we are bound also not to forget\r\nour own. We, too, have our privileges; we, too, are an estate of the\r\nrealm. A House of Commons strong in the love and confidence of the\r\npeople, a House of Commons which has nothing to fear from a dissolution,\r\nis something in the government. Some persons, I well know, indulge a\r\nhope that the rejection of the bill will at once restore the domination\r\nof that party which fled from power last November, leaving everything\r\nabroad and everything at home in confusion; leaving the European system,\r\nwhich it had built up at a vast cost of blood and treasure, falling to\r\npieces in every direction; leaving the dynasties which it had restored,\r\nhastening into exile; leaving the nations which it had joined together,\r\nbreaking away from each other; leaving the fundholders in dismay;\r\nleaving the peasantry in insurrection; leaving the most fertile counties\r\nlighted up with the fires of incendiaries; leaving the capital in such\r\na state, that a royal procession could not pass safely through it.\r\nDark and terrible, beyond any season within my remembrance of political\r\naffairs, was the day of their flight. Far darker and far more terrible\r\nwill be the day of their return. They will return in opposition to\r\nthe whole British nation, united as it was never before united on any\r\ninternal question; united as firmly as when the Armada was sailing up\r\nthe Channel; united as firmly as when Bonaparte pitched his camp on the\r\ncliffs of Boulogne. They will return pledged to defend evils which the\r\npeople are resolved to destroy. They will return to a situation in which\r\nthey can stand only by crushing and trampling down public opinion, and\r\nfrom which, if they fall, they may, in their fall, drag down with them\r\nthe whole frame of society. Against such evils, should such evils appear\r\nto threaten the country, it will be our privilege and our duty to warn\r\nour gracious and beloved Sovereign. It will be our privilege and our\r\nduty to convey the wishes of a loyal people to the throne of a patriot\r\nking. At such a crisis the proper place for the House of Commons is\r\nin front of the nation; and in that place this House will assuredly\r\nbe found. Whatever prejudice or weakness may do elsewhere to ruin the\r\nempire, here, I trust, will not be wanting the wisdom, the virtue, and\r\nthe energy that may save it.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARLIAMENTARY REFORM. (OCTOBER 10, 1831) A SPEECH DELIVERED IN THE HOUSE\r\nOF COMMONS ON THE 10TH OF OCTOBER, 1831.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of Saturday, the eighth of October, 1831, the House of\r\nLords, by a majority of 190 to 158, rejected the Reform Bill. On the\r\nMonday following, Lord Ebrington, member for Devonshire, moved the\r\nfollowing resolution in the House of Commons:\r\n\r\n\"That while this House deeply laments the present fate of a bill for\r\namending the representation of the people in England and Wales,\r\nin favour of which the opinion of the country stands unequivocally\r\npronounced, and which has been matured by discussions the most anxious\r\nand laborious, it feels itself called upon to reassert its firm\r\nadherence to the principle and leading provisions of that great measure,\r\nand to express its unabated confidence in the integrity, perseverance,\r\nand ability of those Ministers, who, in introducing and conducting it,\r\nhave so well consulted the best interests of the country.\"\r\n\r\nThe resolution was carried by 329 votes to 198. The following speech was\r\nmade early in the debate.\r\n\r\nI doubt, Sir, whether any person who had merely heard the speech of the\r\nright honourable Member for the University of Cambridge (Mr Goulburn.)\r\nwould have been able to conjecture what the question is on which we are\r\ndiscussing, and what the occasion on which we are assembled. For myself,\r\nI can with perfect certainty declare that never in the whole course of\r\nmy life did I feel my mind oppressed by so deep and solemn a sense\r\nof responsibility as at the present moment. I firmly believe that the\r\ncountry is now in danger of calamities greater than ever threatened it,\r\nfrom domestic misgovernment or from foreign hostility. The danger is no\r\nless than this, that there may be a complete alienation of the people\r\nfrom their rulers. To soothe the public mind, to reconcile the people to\r\nthe delay, the short delay, which must intervene before their wishes can\r\nbe legitimately gratified, and in the meantime to avert civil discord,\r\nand to uphold the authority of law, these are, I conceive, the objects\r\nof my noble friend, the Member for Devonshire: these ought, at the\r\npresent crisis, to be the objects of every honest Englishman. They\r\nare objects which will assuredly be attained, if we rise to this great\r\noccasion, if we take our stand in the place which the Constitution has\r\nassigned to us, if we employ, with becoming firmness and dignity, the\r\npowers which belong to us as trustees of the nation, and as advisers of\r\nthe Throne.\r\n\r\nSir, the Resolution of my noble friend consists of two parts. He calls\r\nupon us to declare our undiminished attachment to the principles of\r\nthe Reform Bill, and also our undiminished confidence in His Majesty's\r\nMinisters. I consider these two declarations as identical. The question\r\nof Reform is, in my opinion, of such paramount importance, that,\r\napproving the principles of the Ministerial Bill, I must think the\r\nMinisters who have brought that bill forward, although I may differ\r\nfrom them on some minor points, entitled to the strongest support\r\nof Parliament. The right honourable gentleman, the Member for the\r\nUniversity of Cambridge, has attempted to divert the course of the\r\ndebate to questions comparatively unimportant. He has said much about\r\nthe coal duty, about the candle duty, about the budget of the present\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer. On most of the points to which he has\r\nreferred, it would be easy for me, were I so inclined, to defend the\r\nMinisters; and where I could not defend them, I should find it easy to\r\nrecriminate on those who preceded them. The right honourable Member for\r\nthe University of Cambridge has taunted the Ministers with the defeat\r\nwhich their plan respecting the timber trade sustained in the last\r\nParliament. I might, perhaps, at a more convenient season, be tempted\r\nto inquire whether that defeat was more disgraceful to them or to their\r\npredecessors. I might, perhaps, be tempted to ask the right honourable\r\ngentleman whether, if he had not been treated, while in office, with\r\nmore fairness than he has shown while in opposition, it would have been\r\nin his power to carry his best bill, the Beer Bill? He has accused\r\nthe Ministers of bringing forward financial propositions, and then\r\nwithdrawing those propositions. Did not he bring forward, during the\r\nSession of 1830, a plan respecting the sugar duties? And was not that\r\nplan withdrawn? But, Sir, this is mere trifling. I will not be seduced\r\nfrom the matter in hand by the right honourable gentleman's example.\r\nAt the present moment I can see only one question in the State, the\r\nquestion of Reform; only two parties, the friends of the Reform Bill and\r\nits enemies.\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention, Sir, again to discuss the merits of the Reform\r\nBill. The principle of that bill received the approbation of the late\r\nHouse of Commons after a discussion of ten nights; and the bill as it\r\nnow stands, after a long and most laborious investigation, passed the\r\npresent House of Commons by a majority which was nearly half as large\r\nagain as the minority. This was little more than a fortnight ago.\r\nNothing has since occurred to change our opinion. The justice of the\r\ncase is unaltered. The public enthusiasm is undiminished. Old Sarum has\r\ngrown no larger. Manchester has grown no smaller. In addressing this\r\nHouse, therefore, I am entitled to assume that the bill is in itself a\r\ngood bill. If so, ought we to abandon it merely because the Lords have\r\nrejected it? We ought to respect the lawful privileges of their\r\nHouse; but we ought also to assert our own. We are constitutionally as\r\nindependent of their Lordships as their Lordships are of us. We have\r\nprecisely as good a right to adhere to our opinion as they have to\r\ndissent from it. In speaking of their decision, I will attempt to follow\r\nthat example of moderation which was so judiciously set by my noble\r\nfriend, the Member for Devonshire. I will only say that I do not think\r\nthat they are more competent to form a correct judgment on a political\r\nquestion than we are. It is certain that, on all the most important\r\npoints on which the two Houses have for a long time past differed,\r\nthe Lords have at length come over to the opinion of the Commons. I am\r\ntherefore entitled to say, that with respect to all those points, the\r\nPeers themselves being judges, the House of Commons was in the right and\r\nthe House of Lords in the wrong. It was thus with respect to the Slave\r\ntrade: it was thus with respect to Catholic Emancipation: it was thus\r\nwith several other important questions. I, therefore, cannot think that\r\nwe ought, on the present occasion, to surrender our judgment to those\r\nwho have acknowledged that, on former occasions of the same kind, we\r\nhave judged more correctly than they.\r\n\r\nThen again, Sir, I cannot forget how the majority and the minority in\r\nthis House were composed; I cannot forget that the majority contained\r\nalmost all those gentlemen who are returned by large bodies of electors.\r\nIt is, I believe, no exaggeration to say, that there were single Members\r\nof the majority who had more constituents than the whole minority put\r\ntogether. I speak advisedly and seriously. I believe that the number of\r\nfreeholders of Yorkshire exceeds that of all the electors who return the\r\nOpposition. I cannot with propriety comment here on any reports which\r\nmay have been circulated concerning the majority and minority in the\r\nHouse of Lords. I may, however, mention these notoriously historical\r\nfacts; that during the last forty years the powers of the executive\r\nGovernment have been, almost without intermission, exercised by a party\r\nopposed to Reform; and that a very great number of Peers have been\r\ncreated, and all the present Bishops raised to the bench during those\r\nyears. On this question, therefore, while I feel more than usual respect\r\nfor the judgment of the House of Commons, I feel less than usual respect\r\nfor the judgment of the House of Lords. Our decision is the decision of\r\nthe nation; the decision of their Lordships can scarcely be considered\r\nas the decision even of that class from which the Peers are\r\ngenerally selected, and of which they may be considered as virtual\r\nrepresentatives, the great landed gentlemen of England. It seems to me\r\nclear, therefore, that we ought, notwithstanding what has passed in the\r\nother House, to adhere to our opinion concerning the Reform Bill.\r\n\r\nThe next question is this; ought we to make a formal declaration that we\r\nadhere to our opinion? I think that we ought to make such a declaration;\r\nand I am sure that we cannot make it in more temperate or more\r\nconstitutional terms than those which my noble friend asks us to adopt.\r\nI support the Resolution which he has proposed with all my heart and\r\nsoul: I support it as a friend to Reform; but I support it still more\r\nas a friend to law, to property, to social order. No observant and\r\nunprejudiced man can look forward without great alarm to the effects\r\nwhich the recent decision of the Lords may possibly produce. I do not\r\npredict, I do not expect, open, armed insurrection. What I apprehend\r\nis this, that the people may engage in a silent, but extensive and\r\npersevering war against the law. What I apprehend is, that England may\r\nexhibit the same spectacle which Ireland exhibited three years ago,\r\nagitators stronger than the magistrate, associations stronger than the\r\nlaw, a Government powerful enough to be hated, and not powerful enough\r\nto be feared, a people bent on indemnifying themselves by illegal\r\nexcesses for the want of legal privileges. I fear, that we may before\r\nlong see the tribunals defied, the tax-gatherer resisted, public credit\r\nshaken, property insecure, the whole frame of society hastening to\r\ndissolution. It is easy to say, \"Be bold: be firm: defy intimidation:\r\nlet the law have its course: the law is strong enough to put down the\r\nseditious.\" Sir, we have heard all this blustering before; and we know\r\nin what it ended. It is the blustering of little men whose lot has\r\nfallen on a great crisis. Xerxes scourging the winds, Canute commanding\r\nthe waves to recede from his footstool, were but types of the folly\r\nof those who apply the maxims of the Quarter Sessions to the great\r\nconvulsions of society. The law has no eyes: the law has no hands:\r\nthe law is nothing, nothing but a piece of paper printed by the King's\r\nprinter, with the King's arms at the top, till public opinion breathes\r\nthe breath of life into the dead letter. We found this in Ireland. The\r\nCatholic Association bearded the Government. The Government resolved\r\nto put down the Association. An indictment was brought against my\r\nhonourable and learned friend, the Member for Kerry. The Grand Jury\r\nthrew it out. Parliament met. The Lords Commissioners came down with a\r\nspeech recommending the suppression of the self-constituted legislature\r\nof Dublin. A bill was brought in: it passed both Houses by large\r\nmajorities: it received the Royal assent. And what effect did it\r\nproduce? Exactly as much as that old Act of Queen Elizabeth, still\r\nunrepealed, by which it is provided that every man who, without a\r\nspecial exemption, shall eat meat on Fridays and Saturdays, shall pay a\r\nfine of twenty shillings or go to prison for a month. Not only was the\r\nAssociation not destroyed: its power was not for one day suspended: it\r\nflourished and waxed strong under the law which had been made for the\r\npurpose of annihilating it. The elections of 1826, the Clare election\r\ntwo years later, proved the folly of those who think that nations are\r\ngoverned by wax and parchment: and, at length, in the close of 1828, the\r\nGovernment had only one plain choice before it, concession or civil war.\r\nSir, I firmly believe that, if the people of England shall lose all hope\r\nof carrying the Reform Bill by constitutional means, they will forthwith\r\nbegin to offer to the Government the same kind of resistance which\r\nwas offered to the late Government, three years ago, by the people of\r\nIreland, a resistance by no means amounting to rebellion, a resistance\r\nrarely amounting to any crime defined by the law, but a resistance\r\nnevertheless which is quite sufficient to obstruct the course of\r\njustice, to disturb the pursuits of industry, and to prevent the\r\naccumulation of wealth. And is not this a danger which we ought to fear?\r\nAnd is not this a danger which we are bound, by all means in our power,\r\nto avert? And who are those who taunt us for yielding to intimidation?\r\nWho are those who affect to speak with contempt of associations, and\r\nagitators, and public meetings? Even the very persons who, scarce two\r\nyears ago, gave up to associations, and agitators, and public meetings,\r\ntheir boasted Protestant Constitution, proclaiming all the time that\r\nthey saw the evils of Catholic Emancipation as strongly as ever. Surely,\r\nsurely, the note of defiance which is now so loudly sounded in our ears,\r\nproceeds with a peculiarly bad grace from men whose highest glory it\r\nis that they abased themselves to the dust before a people whom their\r\npolicy had driven to madness, from men the proudest moment of whose\r\nlives was that in which they appeared in the character of persecutors\r\nscared into toleration. Do they mean to indemnify themselves for the\r\nhumiliation of quailing before the people of Ireland by trampling on the\r\npeople of England? If so, they deceive themselves. The case of Ireland,\r\nthough a strong one, was by no means so strong a case as that with which\r\nwe have now to deal. The Government, in its struggle with the Catholics\r\nof Ireland, had Great Britain at its back. Whom will it have at its back\r\nin the struggle with the Reformers of Great Britain? I know only two\r\nways in which societies can permanently be governed, by public opinion,\r\nand by the sword. A Government having at its command the armies, the\r\nfleets, and the revenues of Great Britain, might possibly hold Ireland\r\nby the sword. So Oliver Cromwell held Ireland; so William the Third held\r\nit; so Mr Pitt held it; so the Duke of Wellington might perhaps have\r\nheld it. But to govern Great Britain by the sword! So wild a thought has\r\nnever, I will venture to say, occurred to any public man of any party;\r\nand, if any man were frantic enough to make the attempt, he would find,\r\nbefore three days had expired, that there is no better sword than that\r\nwhich is fashioned out of a ploughshare. But, if not by the sword, how\r\nis the country to be governed? I understand how the peace is kept at New\r\nYork. It is by the assent and support of the people. I understand also\r\nhow the peace is kept at Milan. It is by the bayonets of the Austrian\r\nsoldiers. But how the peace is to be kept when you have neither the\r\npopular assent nor the military force, how the peace is to be kept\r\nin England by a Government acting on the principles of the present\r\nOpposition, I do not understand.\r\n\r\nThere is in truth a great anomaly in the relation between the English\r\npeople and their Government. Our institutions are either too popular or\r\nnot popular enough. The people have not sufficient power in making the\r\nlaws; but they have quite sufficient power to impede the execution of\r\nthe laws when made. The Legislature is almost entirely aristocratical;\r\nthe machinery by which the degrees of the Legislature are carried into\r\neffect is almost entirely popular; and, therefore, we constantly see\r\nall the power which ought to execute the law, employed to counteract the\r\nlaw. Thus, for example, with a criminal code which carries its rigour\r\nto the length of atrocity, we have a criminal judicature which often\r\ncarries its lenity to the length of perjury. Our law of libel is the\r\nmost absurdly severe that ever existed, so absurdly severe that, if it\r\nwere carried into full effect, it would be much more oppressive than\r\na censorship. And yet, with this severe law of libel, we have a\r\npress which practically is as free as the air. In 1819 the Ministers\r\ncomplained of the alarming increase of seditious and blasphemous\r\npublications. They proposed a bill of great rigour to stop the growth\r\nof the evil; and they carried their bill. It was enacted, that the\r\npublisher of a seditious libel might, on a second conviction, be\r\nbanished, and that if he should return from banishment, he might be\r\ntransported. How often was this law put in force? Not once. Last year we\r\nrepealed it: but it was already dead, or rather it was dead born. It\r\nwas obsolete before Le Roi le veut had been pronounced over it. For any\r\neffect which it produced it might as well have been in the Code Napoleon\r\nas in the English Statute Book. And why did the Government, having\r\nsolicited and procured so sharp and weighty a weapon, straightway hang\r\nit up to rust? Was there less sedition, were there fewer libels, after\r\nthe passing of the Act than before it? Sir, the very next year was the\r\nyear 1820, the year of the Bill of Pains and Penalties against Queen\r\nCaroline, the very year when the public mind was most excited, the very\r\nyear when the public press was most scurrilous. Why then did not the\r\nMinisters use their new law? Because they durst not: because they could\r\nnot. They had obtained it with ease; for in obtaining it they had to\r\ndeal with a subservient Parliament. They could not execute it: for in\r\nexecuting it they would have to deal with a refractory people. These\r\nare instances of the difficulty of carrying the law into effect when the\r\npeople are inclined to thwart their rulers. The great anomaly, or, to\r\nspeak more properly, the great evil which I have described, would,\r\nI believe, be removed by the Reform Bill. That bill would establish\r\nharmony between the people and the Legislature. It would give a fair\r\nshare in the making of laws to those without whose co-operation laws are\r\nmere waste paper. Under a reformed system we should not see, as we now\r\noften see, the nation repealing Acts of Parliament as fast as we and\r\nthe Lords can pass them. As I believe that the Reform Bill would produce\r\nthis blessed and salutary concord, so I fear that the rejection of\r\nthe Reform Bill, if that rejection should be considered as final, will\r\naggravate the evil which I have been describing to an unprecedented,\r\nto a terrible extent. To all the laws which might be passed for the\r\ncollection of the revenue, or for the prevention of sedition, the people\r\nwould oppose the same kind of resistance by means of which they have\r\nsucceeded in mitigating, I might say in abrogating, the law of libel.\r\nThere would be so many offenders that the Government would scarcely know\r\nat whom to aim its blow. Every offender would have so many accomplices\r\nand protectors that the blow would almost always miss the aim. The Veto\r\nof the people, a Veto not pronounced in set form like that of the Roman\r\nTribunes, but quite as effectual as that of the Roman Tribunes for the\r\npurpose of impeding public measures, would meet the Government at every\r\nturn. The administration would be unable to preserve order at home, or\r\nto uphold the national honour abroad; and, at length, men who are now\r\nmoderate, who now think of revolution with horror, would begin to wish\r\nthat the lingering agony of the State might be terminated by one fierce,\r\nsharp, decisive crisis.\r\n\r\nIs there a way of escape from these calamities? I believe that there\r\nis. I believe that, if we do our duty, if we give the people reason to\r\nbelieve that the accomplishment of their wishes is only deferred, if\r\nwe declare our undiminished attachment to the Reform Bill, and our\r\nresolution to support no Minister who will not support that bill, we\r\nshall avert the fearful disasters which impend over the country. There\r\nis danger that, at this conjuncture, men of more zeal than wisdom may\r\nobtain a fatal influence over the public mind. With these men will be\r\njoined others, who have neither zeal nor wisdom, common barrators in\r\npolitics, dregs of society which, in times of violent agitation, are\r\ntossed up from the bottom to the top, and which, in quiet times, sink\r\nagain from the top to their natural place at the bottom. To these men\r\nnothing is so hateful as the prospect of a reconciliation between the\r\norders of the State. A crisis like that which now makes every honest\r\ncitizen sad and anxious fills these men with joy, and with a detestable\r\nhope. And how is it that such men, formed by nature and education to be\r\nobjects of mere contempt, can ever inspire terror? How is it that such\r\nmen, without talents or acquirements sufficient for the management of a\r\nvestry, sometimes become dangerous to great empires? The secret of their\r\npower lies in the indolence or faithlessness of those who ought to take\r\nthe lead in the redress of public grievances. The whole history of low\r\ntraders in sedition is contained in that fine old Hebrew fable which we\r\nhave all read in the Book of Judges. The trees meet to choose a king.\r\nThe vine, and the fig tree, and the olive tree decline the office. Then\r\nit is that the sovereignty of the forest devolves upon the bramble:\r\nthen it is that from a base and noxious shrub goes forth the fire which\r\ndevours the cedars of Lebanon. Let us be instructed. If we are afraid\r\nof political Unions and Reform Associations, let the House of Commons\r\nbecome the chief point of political union: let the House of Commons\r\nbe the great Reform Association. If we are afraid that the people may\r\nattempt to accomplish their wishes by unlawful means, let us give them\r\na solemn pledge that we will use in their cause all our high and ancient\r\nprivileges, so often victorious in old conflicts with tyranny; those\r\nprivileges which our ancestors invoked, not in vain, on the day when a\r\nfaithless king filled our house with his guards, took his seat, Sir, on\r\nyour chair, and saw your predecessor kneeling on the floor before\r\nhim. The Constitution of England, thank God, is not one of those\r\nconstitutions which are past all repair, and which must, for the public\r\nwelfare, be utterly destroyed. It has a decayed part; but it has also\r\na sound and precious part. It requires purification; but it contains\r\nwithin itself the means by which that purification may be effected.\r\nWe read that in old times, when the villeins were driven to revolt by\r\noppression, when the castles of the nobility were burned to the ground,\r\nwhen the warehouses of London were pillaged, when a hundred thousand\r\ninsurgents appeared in arms on Blackheath, when a foul murder\r\nperpetrated in their presence had raised their passions to madness, when\r\nthey were looking round for some captain to succeed and avenge him whom\r\nthey had lost, just then, before Hob Miller, or Tom Carter, or Jack\r\nStraw, could place himself at their head, the King rode up to them and\r\nexclaimed, \"I will be your leader!\" and at once the infuriated multitude\r\nlaid down their arms, submitted to his guidance, dispersed at his\r\ncommand. Herein let us imitate him. Our countrymen are, I fear, at\r\nthis moment, but too much disposed to lend a credulous ear to selfish\r\nimpostors. Let us say to them, \"We are your leaders; we, your own house\r\nof Commons; we, the constitutional interpreters of your wishes; the\r\nknights of forty English shires, the citizens and burgesses of all your\r\nlargest towns. Our lawful power shall be firmly exerted to the utmost\r\nin your cause; and our lawful power is such, that when firmly exerted in\r\nyour cause, it must finally prevail.\" This tone it is our interest and\r\nour duty to take. The circumstances admit of no delay. Is there one\r\namong us who is not looking with breathless anxiety for the next tidings\r\nwhich may arrive from the remote parts of the kingdom? Even while I\r\nspeak, the moments are passing away, the irrevocable moments pregnant\r\nwith the destiny of a great people. The country is in danger: it may be\r\nsaved: we can save it: this is the way: this is the time. In our hands\r\nare the issues of great good and great evil, the issues of the life and\r\ndeath of the State. May the result of our deliberations be the repose\r\nand prosperity of that noble country which is entitled to all our love;\r\nand for the safety of which we are answerable to our own consciences, to\r\nthe memory of future ages, to the Judge of all hearts!\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARLIAMENTARY REFORM. (DECEMBER 16, 1831) A SPEECH DELIVERED IN THE\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS ON THE 16TH OF DECEMBER 1831.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, the sixteenth of December 1831, Lord Althorpe moved the\r\nsecond reading of the Bill to amend the representation of the people in\r\nEngland and Wales. Lord Porchester moved, as an amendment, that the bill\r\nshould be read a second time that day six months. The debate lasted till\r\nafter midnight, and was then adjourned till twelve at noon. The House\r\ndid not divide till one on the Sunday morning. The amendment was then\r\nrejected by 324 votes to 162; and the original motion was carried. The\r\nfollowing Speech was made on the first night of the debate.\r\n\r\nI can assure my noble friend (Lord Mahon.), for whom I entertain\r\nsentiments of respect and kindness which no political difference will,\r\nI trust, ever disturb, that his remarks have given me no pain, except,\r\nindeed, the pain which I feel at being compelled to say a few words\r\nabout myself. Those words shall be very few. I know how unpopular\r\negotism is in this House. My noble friend says that, in the debates of\r\nlast March, I declared myself opposed to the ballot, and that I have\r\nsince recanted, for the purpose of making myself popular with the\r\ninhabitants of Leeds. My noble friend is altogether mistaken. I never\r\nsaid, in any debate, that I was opposed to the ballot. The word ballot\r\nnever passed my lips within this House. I observed strict silence\r\nrespecting it on two accounts; in the first place, because my own\r\nopinions were, till very lately, undecided; in the second place, because\r\nI knew that the agitation of that question, a question of which the\r\nimportance appears to me to be greatly overrated, would divide those on\r\nwhose firm and cordial union the safety of the empire depends. My noble\r\nfriend has taken this opportunity of replying to a speech which I made\r\nlast October. The doctrines which I then laid down were, according to\r\nhim, most intemperate and dangerous. Now, Sir, it happens, curiously\r\nenough, that my noble friend has himself asserted, in his speech of this\r\nnight, those very doctrines, in language so nearly resembling mine that\r\nI might fairly accuse him of plagiarism. I said that laws have no force\r\nin themselves, and that, unless supported by public opinion, they are\r\na mere dead letter. The noble Lord has said exactly the same thing\r\nto-night. \"Keep your old Constitution,\" he exclaims; \"for, whatever may\r\nbe its defects in theory, it has more of the public veneration than your\r\nnew Constitution will have; and no laws can be efficient, unless they\r\nhave the public veneration.\" I said, that statutes are in themselves\r\nonly wax and parchment; and I was called an incendiary by the\r\nopposition. The noble Lord has said to-night that statutes in themselves\r\nare only ink and parchment; and those very persons who reviled me have\r\nenthusiastically cheered him. I am quite at a loss to understand how\r\ndoctrines which are, in his mouth, true and constitutional, can, in\r\nmine, be false and revolutionary.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, it is time that I should address myself to the momentous\r\nquestion before us. I shall certainly give my best support to this bill,\r\nthrough all its stages; and, in so doing, I conceive that I shall act in\r\nstrict conformity with the resolution by which this House, towards\r\nthe close of the late Session, declared its unabated attachment to the\r\nprinciples and to the leading provisions of the First Reform Bill. All\r\nthose principles, all those leading provisions, I find in the\r\npresent measure. In the details there are, undoubtedly, considerable\r\nalterations. Most of the alterations appear to me to be improvements;\r\nand even those alterations which I cannot consider as in themselves\r\nimprovements will yet be most useful, if their effect shall be to\r\nconciliate opponents, and to facilitate the adjustment of a question\r\nwhich, for the sake of order, for the sake of peace, for the sake of\r\ntrade, ought to be, not only satisfactorily, but speedily settled. We\r\nhave been told, Sir, that, if we pronounce this bill to be a better bill\r\nthan the last, we recant all the doctrines which we maintained during\r\nthe last Session, we sing our palinode; we allow that we have had a\r\ngreat escape; we allow that our own conduct was deserving of censure;\r\nwe allow that the party which was the minority in this House, and, most\r\nunhappily for the country, the majority in the other House, has saved\r\nthe country from a great calamity. Sir, even if this charge were well\r\nfounded, there are those who should have been prevented by prudence, if\r\nnot by magnanimity, from bringing it forward. I remember an Opposition\r\nwhich took a very different course. I remember an Opposition which,\r\nwhile excluded from power, taught all its doctrines to the Government;\r\nwhich, after labouring long, and sacrificing much, in order to effect\r\nimprovements in various parts of our political and commercial system,\r\nsaw the honour of those improvements appropriated by others. But the\r\nmembers of that Opposition had, I believe, a sincere desire to promote\r\nthe public good. They, therefore, raised no shout of triumph over the\r\nrecantations of their proselytes. They rejoiced, but with no ungenerous\r\njoy, when their principles of trade, of jurisprudence, of foreign\r\npolicy, of religious liberty, became the principles of the\r\nAdministration. They were content that he who came into fellowship with\r\nthem at the eleventh hour should have a far larger share of the reward\r\nthan those who had borne the burthen and heat of the day. In the year\r\n1828, a single division in this House changed the whole policy of the\r\nGovernment with respect to the Test and Corporation Acts. My noble\r\nfriend, the Paymaster of the Forces, then sat where the right honourable\r\nBaronet, the member for Tamworth, now sits. I do not remember that, when\r\nthe right honourable Baronet announced his change of purpose, my noble\r\nfriend sprang up to talk about palinodes, to magnify the wisdom and\r\nvirtue of the Whigs, and to sneer at his new coadjutors. Indeed, I am\r\nnot sure that the members of the late Opposition did not carry their\r\nindulgence too far; that they did not too easily suffer the fame of\r\nGrattan and Romilly to be transferred to less deserving claimants; that\r\nthey were not too ready, in the joy with which they welcomed the tardy\r\nand convenient repentance of their converts, to grant a general amnesty\r\nfor the errors of the insincerity of years. If it were true that we had\r\nrecanted, this ought not to be made matter of charge against us by men\r\nwhom posterity will remember by nothing but recantations. But, in truth,\r\nwe recant nothing. We have nothing to recant. We support this bill. We\r\nmay possibly think it a better bill than that which preceded it. But\r\nare we therefore bound to admit that we were in the wrong, that the\r\nOpposition was in the right, that the House of Lords has conferred a\r\ngreat benefit on the nation? We saw--who did not see?--great defects\r\nin the first bill. But did we see nothing else? Is delay no evil? Is\r\nprolonged excitement no evil? Is it no evil that the heart of a great\r\npeople should be made sick by deferred hope? We allow that many of the\r\nchanges which have been made are improvements. But we think that it\r\nwould have been far better for the country to have had the last bill,\r\nwith all its defects, than the present bill, with all its improvements.\r\nSecond thoughts are proverbially the best, but there are emergencies\r\nwhich do not admit of second thoughts. There probably never was a law\r\nwhich might not have been amended by delay. But there have been many\r\ncases in which there would have been more mischief in the delay than\r\nbenefit in the amendments. The first bill, however inferior it may have\r\nbeen in its details to the present bill, was yet herein far superior to\r\nthe present bill, than it was the first. If the first bill had passed,\r\nit would, I firmly believe, have produced a complete reconciliation\r\nbetween the aristocracy and the people. It is my earnest wish and prayer\r\nthat the present bill may produce this blessed effect; but I cannot say\r\nthat my hopes are so sanguine as they were at the beginning of the last\r\nSession. The decision of the House of Lords has, I fear, excited in the\r\npublic mind feelings of resentment which will not soon be allayed. What\r\nthen, it is said, would you legislate in haste? Would you legislate in\r\ntimes of great excitement concerning matters of such deep concern? Yes,\r\nSir, I would: and if any bad consequences should follow from the haste\r\nand the excitement, let those be held answerable who, when there was no\r\nneed of haste, when there existed no excitement, refused to listen to\r\nany project of Reform, nay, who made it an argument against Reform, that\r\nthe public mind was not excited. When few meetings were held, when few\r\npetitions were sent up to us, these politicians said, \"Would you alter\r\na Constitution with which the people are perfectly satisfied?\" And now,\r\nwhen the kingdom from one end to the other is convulsed by the question\r\nof Reform, we hear it said by the very same persons, \"Would you alter\r\nthe Representative system in such agitated times as these?\" Half the\r\nlogic of misgovernment lies in this one sophistical dilemma: If the\r\npeople are turbulent, they are unfit for liberty: if they are quiet,\r\nthey do not want liberty.\r\n\r\nI allow that hasty legislation is an evil. I allow that there are great\r\nobjections to legislating in troubled times. But reformers are compelled\r\nto legislate fast, because bigots will not legislate early. Reformers\r\nare compelled to legislate in times of excitement, because bigots will\r\nnot legislate in times of tranquillity. If, ten years ago, nay, if only\r\ntwo years ago, there had been at the head of affairs men who understood\r\nthe signs of the times and the temper of the nation, we should not have\r\nbeen forced to hurry now. If we cannot take our time, it is because we\r\nhave to make up for their lost time. If they had reformed gradually,\r\nwe might have reformed gradually; but we are compelled to move fast,\r\nbecause they would not move at all.\r\n\r\nThough I admit, Sir, that this bill is in its details superior to the\r\nformer bill, I must say that the best parts of this bill, those parts\r\nfor the sake of which principally I support it, those parts for the sake\r\nof which I would support it, however imperfect its details might be,\r\nare parts which it has in common with the former bill. It destroys\r\nnomination; it admits the great body of the middle orders to a share in\r\nthe government; and it contains provisions which will, as I conceive,\r\ngreatly diminish the expense of elections.\r\n\r\nTouching the expense of elections I will say a few words, because that\r\npart of the subject has not, I think, received so much attention as it\r\ndeserves. Whenever the nomination boroughs are attacked, the opponents\r\nof Reform produce a long list of eminent men who have sate for those\r\nboroughs, and who, they tell us, would never have taken any part in\r\npublic affairs but for those boroughs. Now, Sir, I suppose no person\r\nwill maintain that a large constituent body is likely to prefer ignorant\r\nand incapable men to men of information and ability? Whatever objections\r\nthere may be to democratic institutions, it was never, I believe,\r\ndoubted that those institutions are favourable to the development of\r\ntalents. We may prefer the constitution of Sparta to that of Athens, or\r\nthe constitution of Venice to that of Florence: but no person will\r\ndeny that Athens produced more great men than Sparta, or that Florence\r\nproduced more great men than Venice. But to come nearer home: the five\r\nlargest English towns which have now the right of returning two members\r\neach by popular election, are Westminster, Southwark, Liverpool,\r\nBristol, and Norwich. Now let us see what members those places have sent\r\nto Parliament. I will not speak of the living, though among the living\r\nare some of the most distinguished ornaments of the House. I will\r\nconfine myself to the dead. Among many respectable and useful members\r\nof Parliament, whom these towns have returned, during the last half\r\ncentury, I find Mr Burke, Mr Fox, Mr Sheridan, Mr Windham, Mr Tierney,\r\nSir Samuel Romilly, Mr Canning, Mr Huskisson. These were eight of\r\nthe most illustrious parliamentary leaders of the generation which\r\nis passing away from the world. Mr Pitt was, perhaps, the only\r\nperson worthy to make a ninth with them. It is, surely, a remarkable\r\ncircumstance that, of the nine most distinguished Members of the House\r\nof Commons who have died within the last forty years, eight should have\r\nbeen returned to Parliament by the five largest represented towns. I am,\r\ntherefore, warranted in saying that great constituent bodies are quite\r\nas competent to discern merit, and quite as much disposed to reward\r\nmerit, as the proprietors of boroughs. It is true that some of the\r\ndistinguished statesmen whom I have mentioned would never have been\r\nknown to large constituent bodies if they had not first sate for\r\nnomination boroughs. But why is this? Simply, because the expense of\r\ncontesting popular places, under the present system, is ruinously\r\ngreat. A poor man cannot defray it; an untried man cannot expect his\r\nconstituents to defray it for him. And this is the way in which our\r\nRepresentative system is defended. Corruption vouches corruption. Every\r\nabuse is made the plea for another abuse. We must have nomination at\r\nGatton because we have profusion at Liverpool. Sir, these arguments\r\nconvince me, not that no Reform is required, but that a very deep and\r\nsearching Reform is required. If two evils serve in some respects to\r\ncounterbalance each other, this is a reason, not for keeping both, but\r\nfor getting rid of both together. At present you close against men of\r\ntalents that broad, that noble entrance which belongs to them, and which\r\nought to stand wide open to them; and in exchange you open to them a bye\r\nentrance, low and narrow, always obscure, often filthy, through which,\r\ntoo often, they can pass only by crawling on their hands and knees, and\r\nfrom which they too often emerge sullied with stains never to be washed\r\naway. But take the most favourable case. Suppose that the member who\r\nsits for a nomination borough owes his seat to a man of virtue and\r\nhonour, to a man whose service is perfect freedom, to a man who would\r\nthink himself degraded by any proof of gratitude which might degrade\r\nhis nominee. Yet is it nothing that such a member comes into this House\r\nwearing the badge, though not feeling the chain of servitude? Is it\r\nnothing that he cannot speak of his independence without exciting a\r\nsmile? Is it nothing that he is considered, not as a Representative, but\r\nas an adventurer? This is what your system does for men of genius. It\r\nadmits them to political power, not as, under better institutions, they\r\nwould be admitted to power, erect, independent, unsullied; but by\r\nmeans which corrupt the virtue of many, and in some degree diminish the\r\nauthority of all. Could any system be devised, better fitted to pervert\r\nthe principles and break the spirit of men formed to be the glory of\r\ntheir country? And, can we mention no instance in which this system has\r\nmade such men useless, or worse than useless, to the country of which\r\ntheir talents were the ornament, and might, in happier circumstances,\r\nhave been the salvation? Ariel, the beautiful and kindly Ariel, doing\r\nthe bidding of the loathsome and malignant Sycorax, is but a faint\r\ntype of genius enslaved by the spells, and employed in the drudgery of\r\ncorruption--\r\n\r\n     \"A spirit too delicate\r\n     To act those earthy and abhorred commands.\"\r\n\r\nWe cannot do a greater service to men of real merit than by destroying\r\nthat which has been called their refuge, which is their house of\r\nbondage; by taking from them the patronage of the great, and giving to\r\nthem in its stead the respect and confidence of the people. The bill now\r\nbefore us will, I believe, produce that happy effect. It facilitates the\r\ncanvass; it reduces the expense of legal agency; it shortens the poll;\r\nabove all, it disfranchises the outvoters. It is not easy to calculate\r\nthe precise extent to which these changes will diminish the cost of\r\nelections. I have attempted, however, to obtain some information on this\r\nsubject. I have applied to a gentleman of great experience in affairs of\r\nthis kind, a gentleman who, at the last three general elections, managed\r\nthe finances of the popular party in one of the largest boroughs in the\r\nkingdom. He tells me, that at the general election of 1826, when that\r\nborough was contested, the expenses of the popular candidate amounted to\r\neighteen thousand pounds; and that, by the best estimate which can now\r\nbe made, the borough may, under the reformed system, be as effectually\r\ncontested for one tenth part of that sum. In the new constituent bodies\r\nthere are no ancient rights reserved. In those bodies, therefore, the\r\nexpense of an election will be still smaller. I firmly believe, that it\r\nwill be possible to poll out Manchester for less than the market price\r\nof Old Sarum.\r\n\r\nSir, I have, from the beginning of these discussions, supported Reform\r\non two grounds; first, because I believe it to be in itself a good\r\nthing; and secondly, because I think the dangers of withholding it so\r\ngreat that, even if it were an evil, it would be the less of two evils.\r\nThe dangers of the country have in no wise diminished. I believe that\r\nthey have greatly increased. It is, I fear, impossible to deny that\r\nwhat has happened with respect to almost every great question that\r\never divided mankind has happened also with respect to the Reform Bill.\r\nWherever great interests are at stake there will be much excitement; and\r\nwherever there is much excitement there will be some extravagance. The\r\nsame great stirring of the human mind which produced the Reformation\r\nproduced also the follies and crimes of the Anabaptists. The same spirit\r\nwhich resisted the Ship-money, and abolished the Star Chamber, produced\r\nthe Levellers and the Fifth Monarchy men. And so, it cannot be denied\r\nthat bad men, availing themselves of the agitation produced by the\r\nquestion of Reform, have promulgated, and promulgated with some success,\r\ndoctrines incompatible with the existence, I do not say of monarchy, or\r\nof aristocracy, but of all law, of all order, of all property, of all\r\ncivilisation, of all that makes us to differ from Mohawks or Hottentots.\r\nI bring no accusation against that portion of the working classes which\r\nhas been imposed upon by these doctrines. Those persons are what their\r\nsituation has made them, ignorant from want of leisure, irritable\r\nfrom the sense of distress. That they should be deluded by impudent\r\nassertions and gross sophisms; that, suffering cruel privations, they\r\nshould give ready credence to promises of relief; that, never having\r\ninvestigated the nature and operation of government, they should expect\r\nimpossibilities from it, and should reproach it for not performing\r\nimpossibilities; all this is perfectly natural. No errors which they may\r\ncommit ought ever to make us forget that it is in all probability owing\r\nsolely to the accident of our situation that we have not fallen into\r\nerrors precisely similar. There are few of us who do not know from\r\nexperience that, even with all our advantages of education, pain and\r\nsorrow can make us very querulous and very unreasonable. We ought not,\r\ntherefore, to be surprised that, as the Scotch proverb says, \"it should\r\nbe ill talking between a full man and a fasting;\" that the logic of\r\nthe rich man who vindicates the rights of property, should seem very\r\ninconclusive to the poor man who hears his children cry for bread.\r\nI bring, I say, no accusation against the working classes. I would\r\nwithhold from them nothing which it might be for their good to possess.\r\nI see with pleasure that, by the provisions of the Reform Bill, the most\r\nindustrious and respectable of our labourers will be admitted to a share\r\nin the government of the State. If I would refuse to the working people\r\nthat larger share of power which some of them have demanded, I would\r\nrefuse it, because I am convinced that, by giving it, I should only\r\nincrease their distress. I admit that the end of government is their\r\nhappiness. But, that they may be governed for their happiness, they must\r\nnot be governed according to the doctrines which they have learned from\r\ntheir illiterate, incapable, low-minded flatterers.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, the fact that such doctrines have been promulgated among the\r\nmultitude is a strong argument for a speedy and effectual reform.\r\nThat government is attacked is a reason for making the foundations\r\nof government broader, and deeper, and more solid. That property is\r\nattacked is a reason for binding together all proprietors in the\r\nfirmest union. That the agitation of the question of Reform has enabled\r\nworthless demagogues to propagate their notions with some success is a\r\nreason for speedily settling the question in the only way in which it\r\ncan be settled. It is difficult, Sir, to conceive any spectacle more\r\nalarming than that which presents itself to us, when we look at the two\r\nextreme parties in this country; a narrow oligarchy above; an infuriated\r\nmultitude below; on the one side the vices engendered by power; on the\r\nother side the vices engendered by distress; one party blindly averse\r\nto improvement; the other party blindly clamouring for destruction; one\r\nparty ascribing to political abuses the sanctity of property; the other\r\nparty crying out against property as a political abuse. Both these\r\nparties are alike ignorant of their true interest. God forbid that the\r\nstate should ever be at the mercy of either, or should ever experience\r\nthe calamities which must result from a collision between them! I\r\nanticipate no such horrible event. For, between those two parties\r\nstands a third party, infinitely more powerful than both the others put\r\ntogether, attacked by both, vilified by both, but destined, I trust,\r\nto save both from the fatal effects of their own folly. To that party\r\nI have never ceased, through all the vicissitudes of public affairs, to\r\nlook with confidence and with good a hope. I speak of that great party\r\nwhich zealously and steadily supported the first Reform Bill, and\r\nwhich will, I have no doubt, support the second Reform Bill with equal\r\nsteadiness and equal zeal. That party is the middle class of England,\r\nwith the flower of the aristocracy at its head, and the flower of the\r\nworking classes bringing up its rear. That great party has taken its\r\nimmovable stand between the enemies of all order and the enemies of\r\nall liberty. It will have Reform: it will not have revolution: it will\r\ndestroy political abuses: it will not suffer the rights of property to\r\nbe assailed: it will preserve, in spite of themselves, those who are\r\nassailing it, from the right and from the left, with contradictory\r\naccusations: it will be a daysman between them: it will lay its hand\r\nupon them both: it will not suffer them to tear each other in pieces.\r\nWhile that great party continues unbroken, as it now is unbroken, I\r\nshall not relinquish the hope that this great contest may be conducted,\r\nby lawful means, to a happy termination. But, of this I am assured, that\r\nby means, lawful or unlawful, to a termination, happy or unhappy, this\r\ncontest must speedily come. All that I know of the history of past\r\ntimes, all the observations that I have been able to make on the present\r\nstate of the country, have convinced me that the time has arrived when\r\na great concession must be made to the democracy of England; that the\r\nquestion, whether the change be in itself good or bad, has become a\r\nquestion of secondary importance; that, good or bad, the thing must\r\nbe done; that a law as strong as the laws of attraction and motion has\r\ndecreed it.\r\n\r\nI well know that history, when we look at it in small portions, may be\r\nso construed as to mean anything, that it may be interpreted in as many\r\nways as a Delphic oracle. \"The French Revolution,\" says one expositor,\r\n\"was the effect of concession.\" \"Not so,\" cries another: \"The French\r\nRevolution was produced by the obstinacy of an arbitrary government.\"\r\n\"If the French nobles,\" says the first, \"had refused to sit with the\r\nThird Estate, they would never have been driven from their country.\"\r\n\"They would never have been driven from their country,\" answers the\r\nother, \"if they had agreed to the reforms proposed by M. Turgot.\" These\r\ncontroversies can never be brought to any decisive test, or to any\r\nsatisfactory conclusion. But, as I believe that history, when we look at\r\nit in small fragments, proves anything, or nothing, so I believe that\r\nit is full of useful and precious instruction when we contemplate it\r\nin large portions, when we take in, at one view, the whole lifetime of\r\ngreat societies. I believe that it is possible to obtain some insight\r\ninto the law which regulates the growth of communities, and some\r\nknowledge of the effects which that growth produces. They history of\r\nEngland, in particular, is the history of a government constantly\r\ngiving way, sometimes peaceably, sometimes after a violent struggle,\r\nbut constantly giving way before a nation which has been constantly\r\nadvancing. The forest laws, the laws of villenage, the oppressive power\r\nof the Roman Catholic Church, the power, scarcely less oppressive,\r\nwhich, during some time after the Reformation, was exercised by the\r\nProtestant Establishment, the prerogatives of the Crown, the censorship\r\nof the Press, successively yielded. The abuses of the representative\r\nsystem are now yielding to the same irresistible force. It was\r\nimpossible for the Stuarts, and it would have been impossible for them\r\nif they had possessed all the energy of Richelieu, and all the craft of\r\nMazarin, to govern England as England had been governed by the Tudors.\r\nIt was impossible for the princes of the House of Hanover to govern\r\nEngland as England had been governed by the Stuarts. And so it is\r\nimpossible that England should be any longer governed as it was governed\r\nunder the four first princes of the House of Hanover. I say impossible.\r\nI believe that over the great changes of the moral world we possess as\r\nlittle power as over the great changes of the physical world. We can\r\nno more prevent time from changing the distribution of property and\r\nof intelligence, we can no more prevent property and intelligence from\r\naspiring to political power, than we can change the courses of the\r\nseasons and of the tides. In peace or in tumult, by means of old\r\ninstitutions, where those institutions are flexible, over the ruins\r\nof old institutions, where those institutions oppose an unbending\r\nresistance, the great march of society proceeds, and must proceed. The\r\nfeeble efforts of individuals to bear back are lost and swept away in\r\nthe mighty rush with which the species goes onward. Those who appear to\r\nlead the movement are, in fact, only whirled along before it; those who\r\nattempt to resist it, are beaten down and crushed beneath it.\r\n\r\nIt is because rulers do not pay sufficient attention to the stages of\r\nthis great movement, because they underrate its force, because they are\r\nignorant of its law, that so many violent and fearful revolutions have\r\nchanged the face of society. We have heard it said a hundred times\r\nduring these discussions, we have heard it said repeatedly in the course\r\nof this very debate, that the people of England are more free than ever\r\nthey were, that the Government is more democratic than ever it was; and\r\nthis is urged as an argument against Reform. I admit the fact; but\r\nI deny the inference. It is a principle never to be forgotten, in\r\ndiscussions like this, that it is not by absolute, but by relative\r\nmisgovernment that nations are roused to madness. It is not sufficient\r\nto look merely at the form of government. We must look also to the state\r\nof the public mind. The worst tyrant that ever had his neck wrung in\r\nmodern Europe might have passed for a paragon of clemency in Persia or\r\nMorocco. Our Indian subjects submit patiently to a monopoly of salt. We\r\ntried a stamp duty, a duty so light as to be scarcely perceptible,\r\non the fierce breed of the old Puritans; and we lost an empire. The\r\nGovernment of Louis the Sixteenth was certainly a much better and milder\r\nGovernment than that of Louis the Fourteenth; yet Louis the Fourteenth\r\nwas admired, and even loved, by his people. Louis the Sixteenth died on\r\nthe scaffold. Why? Because, though the Government had made many steps in\r\nthe career of improvement, it had not advanced so rapidly as the nation.\r\nLook at our own history. The liberties of the people were at least as\r\nmuch respected by Charles the First as by Henry the Eighth, by James the\r\nSecond as by Edward the Sixth. But did this save the crown of James the\r\nSecond? Did this save the head of Charles the First? Every person\r\nwho knows the history of our civil dissensions knows that all those\r\narguments which are now employed by the opponents of the Reform Bill\r\nmight have been employed, and were actually employed, by the unfortunate\r\nStuarts. The reasoning of Charles, and of all his apologists, runs\r\nthus:--\"What new grievance does the nation suffer? What has the King\r\ndone more than what Henry did? more than what Elizabeth did? Did the\r\npeople ever enjoy more freedom than at present? Did they ever enjoy so\r\nmuch freedom?\" But what would a wise and honest counsellor, if Charles\r\nhad been so happy as to possess such a counsellor, have replied to\r\narguments like these? He would have said, \"Sir, I acknowledge that the\r\npeople were never more free than under your government. I acknowledge\r\nthat those who talk of restoring the old Constitution of England use\r\nan improper expression. I acknowledge that there has been a constant\r\nimprovement during those very years during which many persons imagine\r\nthat there has been a constant deterioration. But, though there has been\r\nno change in the government for the worse, there has been a change in\r\nthe public mind which produces exactly the same effect which would\r\nbe produced by a change in the government for the worse. Perhaps this\r\nchange in the public mind is to be regretted. But no matter; you cannot\r\nreverse it. You cannot undo all that eighty eventful years have done.\r\nYou cannot transform the Englishmen of 1640 into the Englishmen of 1560.\r\nIt may be that the simple loyalty of our fathers was preferable to that\r\ninquiring, censuring, resisting spirit which is now abroad. It may be\r\nthat the times when men paid their benevolences cheerfully were better\r\ntimes than these, when a gentleman goes before the Exchequer Chamber to\r\nresist an assessment of twenty shillings. And so it may be that infancy\r\nis a happier time than manhood, and manhood than old age. But God has\r\ndecreed that old age shall succeed to manhood, and manhood to infancy.\r\nEven so have societies their law of growth. As their strength becomes\r\ngreater, as their experience becomes more extensive, you can no longer\r\nconfine them within the swaddling bands, or lull them in the cradles, or\r\namuse them with the rattles, or terrify them with the bugbears of their\r\ninfancy. I do not say that they are better or happier than they were;\r\nbut this I say, that they are different from what they were, that you\r\ncannot again make them what they were, and that you cannot safely treat\r\nthem as if they continued to be what they were.\" This was the advice\r\nwhich a wise and honest Minister would have given to Charles the First.\r\nThese were the principles on which that unhappy prince should have\r\nacted. But no. He would govern, I do not say ill, I do not say\r\ntyrannically; I only say this; he would govern the men of the\r\nseventeenth century as if they had been the men of the sixteenth\r\ncentury; and therefore it was, that all his talents and all his virtues\r\ndid not save him from unpopularity, from civil war, from a prison, from\r\na bar, from a scaffold. These things are written for our instruction.\r\nAnother great intellectual revolution has taken place; our lot has\r\nbeen cast on a time analogous, in many respects, to the time which\r\nimmediately preceded the meeting of the Long Parliament. There is\r\na change in society. There must be a corresponding change in the\r\ngovernment. We are not, we cannot, in the nature of things, be, what our\r\nfathers were. We are no more like the men of the American war, or the\r\nmen of the gagging bills, than the men who cried \"privilege\" round the\r\ncoach of Charles the First were like the men who changed their religion\r\nonce a year at the bidding of Henry the Eighth. That there is such a\r\nchange, I can no more doubt than I can doubt that we have more power\r\nlooms, more steam engines, more gas lights, than our ancestors. That\r\nthere is such a change, the Minister will surely find who shall attempt\r\nto fit the yoke of Mr Pitt to the necks of the Englishmen of the\r\nnineteenth century. What then can you do to bring back those times\r\nwhen the constitution of this House was an object of veneration to the\r\npeople? Even as much as Strafford and Laud could do to bring back the\r\ndays of the Tudors; as much as Bonner and Gardiner could do to bring\r\nback the days of Hildebrand; as much as Villele and Polignac could do\r\nto bring back the days of Louis the Fourteenth. You may make the change\r\ntedious; you may make it violent; you may--God in his mercy forbid!--you\r\nmay make it bloody; but avert it you cannot. Agitations of the public\r\nmind, so deep and so long continued as those which we have witnessed, do\r\nnot end in nothing. In peace or in convulsion, by the law, or in spite\r\nof the law, through the Parliament, or over the Parliament, Reform must\r\nbe carried. Therefore be content to guide that movement which you cannot\r\nstop. Fling wide the gates to that force which else will enter through\r\nthe breach. Then will it still be, as it has hitherto been, the peculiar\r\nglory of our Constitution that, though not exempt from the decay which\r\nis wrought by the vicissitudes of fortune, and the lapse of time, in all\r\nthe proudest works of human power and wisdom, it yet contains within\r\nit the means of self-reparation. Then will England add to her manifold\r\ntitles of glory this, the noblest and the purest of all; that every\r\nblessing which other nations have been forced to seek, and have too\r\noften sought in vain, by means of violent and bloody revolutions, she\r\nwill have attained by a peaceful and a lawful Reform.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANATOMY BILL. (FEBRUARY 27, 1832) A SPEECH DELIVERED IN THE HOUSE OF\r\nCOMMONS ON THE 27TH OF FEBRUARY, 1832.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the twenty-seventh of February, 1832, the House took into\r\nconsideration the report of the Committee on Mr Warburton's Anatomy\r\nBill. Mr Henry Hunt attacked that bill with great asperity. In reply to\r\nhim the following Speech was made.\r\n\r\nSir, I cannot, even at this late hour of the night, refrain from saying\r\ntwo or three words. Most of the observations of the honourable Member\r\nfor Preston I pass by, as undeserving of any answer before an audience\r\nlike this. But on one part of his speech I must make a few remarks. We\r\nare, he says, making a law to benefit the rich, at the expense of the\r\npoor. Sir, the fact is the direct reverse. This is a bill which tends\r\nespecially to the benefit of the poor. What are the evils against which\r\nwe are attempting to make provision? Two especially; that is to say, the\r\npractice of Burking, and bad surgery. Now to both these the poor alone\r\nare exposed. What man, in our rank of life, runs the smallest risk of\r\nbeing Burked? That a man has property, that he has connections, that he\r\nis likely to be missed and sought for, are circumstances which secure\r\nhim against the Burker. It is curious to observe the difference between\r\nmurders of this kind and other murders. An ordinary murder hides the\r\nbody, and disposes of the property. Bishop and Williams dig holes and\r\nbury the property, and expose the body to sale. The more wretched, the\r\nmore lonely, any human being may be, the more desirable prey is he to\r\nthese wretches. It is the man, the mere naked man, that they pursue.\r\nAgain, as to bad surgery; this is, of all evils, the evil by which the\r\nrich suffer least, and the poor most. If we could do all that in the\r\nopinion of the Member for Preston ought to be done, if we could destroy\r\nthe English school of anatomy, if we could force every student of\r\nmedical science to go to the expense of a foreign education, on whom\r\nwould the bad consequences fall? On the rich? Not at all. As long as\r\nthere is in France, in Italy, in Germany, a single surgeon of eminent\r\nskill, a single surgeon who is, to use the phrase of the member for\r\nPreston, addicted to dissection, that surgeon will be in attendance\r\nwhenever an English nobleman is to be cut for the stone. The higher\r\norders in England will always be able to procure the best medical\r\nassistance. Who suffers by the bad state of the Russian school of\r\nsurgery? The Emperor Nicholas? By no means. The whole evil falls on the\r\npeasantry. If the education of a surgeon should become very extensive,\r\nif the fees of surgeons should consequently rise, if the supply of\r\nregular surgeons should diminish, the sufferers would be, not the\r\nrich, but the poor in our country villages, who would again be left to\r\nmountebanks, and barbers, and old women, and charms and quack medicines.\r\nThe honourable gentleman talks of sacrificing the interests of humanity\r\nto the interests of science, as if this were a question about the\r\nsquaring of the circle, or the transit of Venus. This is not a mere\r\nquestion of science: it is not the unprofitable exercise of an ingenious\r\nmind: it is a question between health and sickness, between ease and\r\ntorment, between life and death. Does the honourable gentleman know from\r\nwhat cruel sufferings the improvement of surgical science has rescued\r\nour species? I will tell him one story, the first that comes into\r\nmy head. He may have heard of Leopold, Duke of Austria, the same who\r\nimprisoned our Richard Coeur-de-Lion. Leopold's horse fell under him,\r\nand crushed his leg. The surgeons said that the limb must be amputated;\r\nbut none of them knew how to amputate it. Leopold, in his agony, laid a\r\nhatchet on his thigh, and ordered his servant to strike with a mallet.\r\nThe leg was cut off, and the Duke died of the gush of blood. Such was\r\nthe end of that powerful prince. Why, there is not now a bricklayer who\r\nfalls from a ladder in England, who cannot obtain surgical assistance,\r\ninfinitely superior to that which the sovereign of Austria could command\r\nin the twelfth century. I think this a bill which tends to the good\r\nof the people, and which tends especially to the good of the poor.\r\nTherefore I support it. If it is unpopular, I am sorry for it. But\r\nI shall cheerfully take my share of its unpopularity. For such, I am\r\nconvinced, ought to be the conduct of one whose object it is, not to\r\nflatter the people, but to serve them.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARLIAMENTARY REFORM. (FEBRUARY 28, 1832) A SPEECH DELIVERED IN A\r\nCOMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS ON THE 28TH OF FEBRUARY, 1832.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the twenty-eighth of February, 1832, in the Committee on the\r\nBill to amend the representation of the people in England and Wales,\r\nthe question was put, \"That the Tower Hamlets, Middlesex, stand part of\r\nSchedule C.\" The opponents of the Bill mustered their whole strength on\r\nthis occasion, and were joined by some members who had voted with the\r\nGovernment on the second reading. The question was carried, however, by\r\n316 votes to 236. The following Speech was made in reply to the Marquess\r\nof Chandos and Sir Edward Sugden, who, on very different grounds,\r\nobjected to any increase in the number of metropolitan members.\r\n\r\nMr Bernal,--I have spoken so often on the question of Parliamentary\r\nReform, that I am very unwilling to occupy the time of the Committee.\r\nBut the importance of the amendment proposed by the noble Marquess, and\r\nthe peculiar circumstances in which we are placed to-night, make me so\r\nanxious that I cannot remain silent.\r\n\r\nIn this debate, as in every other debate, our first object should be to\r\nascertain on which side the burden of the proof lies. Now, it seems to\r\nme quite clear that the burden of the proof lies on those who support\r\nthe amendment. I am entitled to take it for granted that it is right and\r\nwise to give representatives to some wealthy and populous places which\r\nhave hitherto been unrepresented. To this extent, at least, we all,\r\nwith scarcely an exception, now profess ourselves Reformers. There is,\r\nindeed, a great party which still objects to the disfranchising even\r\nof the smallest boroughs. But all the most distinguished chiefs of that\r\nparty have, here and elsewhere, admitted that the elective franchise\r\nought to be given to some great towns which have risen into importance\r\nsince our representative system took its present form. If this be so, on\r\nwhat ground can it be contended that these metropolitan districts ought\r\nnot to be represented? Are they inferior in importance to the other\r\nplaces to which we are all prepared to give members? I use the word\r\nimportance with perfect confidence: for, though in our recent debates\r\nthere has been some dispute as to the standard by which the importance\r\nof towns is to be measured, there is no room for dispute here.\r\nHere, take what standard you will, the result will be the same. Take\r\npopulation: take the rental: take the number of ten pound houses: take\r\nthe amount of the assessed taxes: take any test in short: take any\r\nnumber of tests, and combine those tests in any of the ingenious ways\r\nwhich men of science have suggested: multiply: divide: subtract: add:\r\ntry squares or cubes: try square roots or cube roots: you will never be\r\nable to find a pretext for excluding these districts from Schedule C.\r\nIf, then, it be acknowledged that the franchise ought to be given\r\nto important places which are at present unrepresented, and if it be\r\nacknowledged that these districts are in importance not inferior to any\r\nplace which is at present unrepresented, you are bound to give us strong\r\nreasons for withholding the franchise from these districts.\r\n\r\nThe honourable and learned gentleman (Sir E. Sugden.) has tried to give\r\nsuch reasons; and, in doing so, he has completely refuted the whole\r\nspeech of the noble Marquess, with whom he means to divide. (The\r\nMarquess of Chandos.) The truth is that the noble Marquess and the\r\nhonourable and learned gentleman, though they agree in their votes, do\r\nnot at all agree in their forebodings or in their ulterior intentions.\r\nThe honourable and learned gentleman thinks it dangerous to increase the\r\nnumber of metropolitan voters. The noble Lord is perfectly willing to\r\nincrease the number of metropolitan voters, and objects only to any\r\nincrease in the number of metropolitan members. \"Will you,\" says the\r\nhonourable and learned gentleman, \"be so rash, so insane, as to create\r\nconstituent bodies of twenty or thirty thousand electors?\" \"Yes,\" says\r\nthe noble Marquess, \"and much more than that. I will create constituent\r\nbodies of forty thousand, sixty thousand, a hundred thousand. I will add\r\nMarylebone to Westminster. I will add Lambeth to Southwark. I will add\r\nFinsbury and the Tower Hamlets to the City.\" The noble Marquess, it\r\nis clear, is not afraid of the excitement which may be produced by the\r\npolling of immense multitudes. Of what then is he afraid? Simply of\r\neight members: nay, of six members: for he is willing, he tells us, to\r\nadd two members to the two who already sit for Middlesex, and who may\r\nbe considered as metropolitan members. Are six members, then, so\r\nformidable? I could mention a single peer who now sends more than six\r\nmembers to the House. But, says the noble Marquess, the members for\r\nthe metropolitan districts will be called to a strict account by their\r\nconstituents: they will be mere delegates: they will be forced to speak,\r\nnot their own sense, but the sense of the capital. I will answer for\r\nit, Sir, that they will not be called to a stricter account than those\r\ngentlemen who are nominated by some great proprietors of boroughs. Is\r\nit not notorious that those who represent it as in the highest degree\r\npernicious and degrading that a public man should be called to account\r\nby a great city which has intrusted its dearest interests to his care,\r\ndo nevertheless think that he is bound by the most sacred ties of\r\nhonour to vote according to the wishes of his patron or to apply for the\r\nChiltern Hundreds? It is a bad thing, I fully admit, that a Member of\r\nParliament should be a mere delegate. But it is not worse that he should\r\nbe the delegate of a hundred thousand people than of one too powerful\r\nindividual. What a perverse, what an inconsistent spirit is this; too\r\nproud to bend to the wishes of a nation, yet ready to lick the dust at\r\nthe feet of a patron! And how is it proved that a member for Lambeth\r\nor Finsbury will be under a more servile awe of his constituents than\r\na member for Leicester, or a member for Leicestershire, or a member\r\nfor the University of Oxford? Is it not perfectly notorious that many\r\nmembers voted, year after year, against Catholic Emancipation, simply\r\nbecause they knew that, if they voted otherwise, they would lose their\r\nseats? No doubt this is an evil. But it is an evil which will exist in\r\nsome form or other as long as human nature is the same, as long as\r\nthere are men so low-minded as to prefer the gratification of a vulgar\r\nambition to the approbation of their conscience and the welfare of their\r\ncountry. Construct your representative system as you will, these men\r\nwill always be sycophants. If you give power to Marylebone, they will\r\nfawn on the householders of Marylebone. If you leave power to Gatton,\r\nthey will fawn on the proprietor of Gatton. I can see no reason for\r\nbelieving that their baseness will be more mischievous in the former\r\ncase than in the latter.\r\n\r\nBut, it is said, the power of this huge capital is even now dangerously\r\ngreat; and will you increase that power? Now, Sir, I am far from denying\r\nthat the power of London is, in some sense, dangerously great; but I\r\naltogether deny that the danger will be increased by this bill. It has\r\nalways been found that a hundred thousand people congregated close to\r\nthe seat of government exercise a greater influence on public affairs\r\nthan five hundred thousand dispersed over a remote province. But this\r\ninfluence is not proportioned to the number of representatives chosen by\r\nthe capital. This influence is felt at present, though the greater part\r\nof the capital is unrepresented. This influence is felt in countries\r\nwhere there is no representative system at all. Indeed, this influence\r\nis nowhere so great as under despotic governments. I need not remind the\r\nCommittee that the Caesars, while ruling by the sword, while putting\r\nto death without a trial every senator, every magistrate, who incurred\r\ntheir displeasure, yet found it necessary to keep the populace of the\r\nimperial city in good humour by distributions of corn and shows of wild\r\nbeasts. Every country, from Britain to Egypt, was squeezed for the means\r\nof filling the granaries and adorning the theatres of Rome. On more than\r\none occasion, long after the Cortes of Castile had become a mere name,\r\nthe rabble of Madrid assembled before the royal palace, forced their\r\nKing, their absolute King, to appear in the balcony, and exacted from\r\nhim a promise that he would dismiss an obnoxious minister. It was in\r\nthis way that Charles the Second was forced to part with Oropesa, and\r\nthat Charles the Third was forced to part with Squillaci. If there is\r\nany country in the world where pure despotism exists, that country is\r\nTurkey; and yet there is no country in the world where the inhabitants\r\nof the capital are so much dreaded by the government. The Sultan, who\r\nstands in awe of nothing else, stands in awe of the turbulent populace,\r\nwhich may, at any moment, besiege him in his Seraglio. As soon as\r\nConstantinople is up, everything is conceded. The unpopular edict is\r\nrecalled. The unpopular vizier is beheaded. This sort of power has\r\nnothing to do with representation. It depends on physical force and\r\non vicinity. You do not propose to take this sort of power away from\r\nLondon. Indeed, you cannot take it away. Nothing can take it away but an\r\nearthquake more terrible than that of Lisbon, or a fire more destructive\r\nthan that of 1666. Law can do nothing against this description of power;\r\nfor it is a power which is formidable only when law has ceased to exist.\r\nWhile the reign of law continues, eight votes in a House of six hundred\r\nand fifty-eight Members will hardly do much harm. When the reign of law\r\nis at an end, and the reign of violence commences, the importance of a\r\nmillion and a half of people, all collected within a walk of the Palace,\r\nof the Parliament House, of the Bank, of the Courts of Justice, will not\r\nbe measured by eight or by eighty votes. See, then, what you are doing.\r\nThat power which is not dangerous you refuse to London. That power which\r\nis dangerous you leave undiminished; nay, you make it more dangerous\r\nstill. For by refusing to let eight or nine hundred thousand people\r\nexpress their opinions and wishes in a legal and constitutional way, you\r\nincrease the risk of disaffection and of tumult. It is not necessary to\r\nhave recourse to the speeches or writings of democrats to show that\r\na represented district is far more likely to be turbulent than an\r\nunrepresented district. Mr Burke, surely not a rash innovator, not\r\na flatterer of the multitude, described long ago in this place\r\nwith admirable eloquence the effect produced by the law which gave\r\nrepresentative institutions to the rebellious mountaineers of Wales.\r\nThat law, he said, had been to an agitated nation what the twin stars\r\ncelebrated by Horace were to a stormy sea; the wind had fallen; the\r\nclouds had dispersed; the threatening waves had sunk to rest. I have\r\nmentioned the commotions of Madrid and Constantinople. Why is it that\r\nthe population of unrepresented London, though physically far more\r\npowerful than the population of Madrid or of Constantinople, has been\r\nfar more peaceable? Why have we never seen the inhabitants of the\r\nmetropolis besiege St James's, or force their way riotously into this\r\nHouse? Why, but because they have other means of giving vent to their\r\nfeelings, because they enjoy the liberty of unlicensed printing, and the\r\nliberty of holding public meetings. Just as the people of unrepresented\r\nLondon are more orderly than the people of Constantinople and Madrid, so\r\nwill the people of represented London be more orderly than the people of\r\nunrepresented London.\r\n\r\nSurely, Sir, nothing can be more absurd than to withhold legal power\r\nfrom a portion of the community because that portion of the community\r\npossesses natural power. Yet that is precisely what the noble Marquess\r\nwould have us do. In all ages a chief cause of the intestine disorders\r\nof states has been that the natural distribution of power and the legal\r\ndistribution of power have not corresponded with each other. This is\r\nno newly discovered truth. It was well known to Aristotle more than two\r\nthousand years ago. It is illustrated by every part of ancient and of\r\nmodern history, and eminently by the history of England during the last\r\nfew months. Our country has been in serious danger; and why? Because\r\na representative system, framed to suit the England of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, did not suit the England of the nineteenth century; because an\r\nold wall, the last relique of a departed city, retained the privileges\r\nof that city, while great towns, celebrated all over the world for\r\nwealth and intelligence, had no more share in the government than when\r\nthey were still hamlets. The object of this bill is to correct those\r\nmonstrous disproportions, and to bring the legal order of society into\r\nsomething like harmony with the natural order. What, then, can be more\r\ninconsistent with the fundamental principle of the bill than to exclude\r\nany district from a share in the representation, for no reason but\r\nbecause that district is, and must always be, one of great importance?\r\nThis bill was meant to reconcile and unite. Will you frame it in such a\r\nmanner that it must inevitably produce irritation and discord? This bill\r\nwas meant to be final in the only rational sense of the word final. Will\r\nyou frame it in such a way that it must inevitably be shortlived? Is it\r\nto be the first business of the first reformed House of Commons to pass\r\na new Reform Bill? Gentlemen opposite have often predicted that the\r\nsettlement which we are making will not be permanent; and they are now\r\ntaking the surest way to accomplish their own prediction. I agree with\r\nthem in disliking change merely as change. I would bear with many\r\nthings which are indefensible in theory, nay, with some things which are\r\ngrievous in practice, rather than venture on a change in the composition\r\nof Parliament. But when such a change is necessary,--and that such a\r\nchange is now necessary is admitted by men of all parties,--then I hold\r\nthat it ought to be full and effectual. A great crisis may be followed\r\nby the complete restoration of health. But no constitution will bear\r\nperpetual tampering. If the noble Marquess's amendment should unhappily\r\nbe carried, it is morally certain that the immense population of\r\nFinsbury, of Marylebone, of Lambeth, of the Tower Hamlets, will,\r\nimportunately and clamorously, demand redress from the reformed\r\nParliament. That Parliament, you tell us, will be much more\r\ndemocratically inclined than the Parliaments of past times. If so, how\r\ncan you expect that it will resist the urgent demands of a million of\r\npeople close to its door? These eight seats will be given. More than\r\neight seats will be given. The whole question of Reform will be opened\r\nagain; and the blame will rest on those who will, by mutilating this\r\ngreat law in an essential part, cause hundreds of thousands who now\r\nregard it as a boon to regard it as an outrage.\r\n\r\nSir, our word is pledged. Let us remember the solemn promise which we\r\ngave to the nation last October at a perilous conjuncture. That promise\r\nwas that we would stand firmly by the principles and leading provisions\r\nof the Reform Bill. Our sincerity is now brought to the test. One of the\r\nleading provisions of the bill is in danger. The question is, not merely\r\nwhether these districts shall be represented, but whether we will keep\r\nthe faith which we plighted to our countrymen. Let us be firm. Let us\r\nmake no concession to those who, having in vain tried to throw the bill\r\nout, are now trying to fritter it away. An attempt has been made to\r\ninduce the Irish members to vote against the government. It has been\r\nhinted that, perhaps, some of the seats taken from the metropolis may be\r\ngiven to Ireland. Our Irish friends will, I doubt not, remember that\r\nthe very persons who offer this bribe exerted themselves not long ago\r\nto raise a cry against the proposition to give additional members to\r\nBelfast, Limerick, Waterford, and Galway. The truth is that our enemies\r\nwish only to divide us, and care not by what means. One day they try\r\nto excite jealousy among the English by asserting that the plan of the\r\ngovernment is too favourable to Ireland. Next day they try to bribe the\r\nIrish to desert us, by promising to give something to Ireland at the\r\nexpense of England. Let us disappoint these cunning men. Let us, from\r\nwhatever part of the United Kingdom we come, be true to each other and\r\nto the good cause. We have the confidence of our country. We have justly\r\nearned it. For God's sake let us not throw it away. Other occasions may\r\narise on which honest Reformers may fairly take different sides. But\r\nto-night he that is not with us is against us.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPEAL OF THE UNION WITH IRELAND. (FEBRUARY 6, 1833) A SPEECH DELIVERED\r\nIN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS ON THE 6TH OF FEBRUARY 1833.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-ninth of January 1833, the first Parliament elected under\r\nthe Reform Act of 1832 met at Westminster. On the fifth of February,\r\nKing William the Fourth made a speech from the throne, in which he\r\nexpressed his hope that the Houses would entrust him with such powers as\r\nmight be necessary for maintaining order in Ireland and for preserving\r\nand strengthening the union between that country and Great Britain.\r\nAn Address, assuring His Majesty of the concurrence and support of the\r\nCommons, was moved by Lord Ormelie and seconded by Mr John Marshall.\r\nMr O'Connell opposed the Address, and moved, as an amendment, that the\r\nHouse should resolve itself into a Committee. After a discussion of\r\nfour nights the amendment was rejected by 428 votes to 40. On the second\r\nnight of the debate the following Speech was made.\r\n\r\nLast night, Sir, I thought that it would not be necessary for me to take\r\nany part in the present debate: but the appeal which has this evening\r\nbeen made to me by my honourable friend the Member for Lincoln (Mr\r\nEdward Lytton Bulwer.) has forced me to rise. I will, however, postpone\r\nthe few words which I have to say in defence of my own consistency, till\r\nI have expressed my opinion on the much more important subject which is\r\nbefore the House.\r\n\r\nMy honourable friend tells us that we are now called upon to make a\r\nchoice between two modes of pacifying Ireland; that the government\r\nrecommends coercion; that the honourable and learned Member for Dublin\r\n(Mr O'Connell.) recommends redress; and that it is our duty to try the\r\neffect of redress before we have recourse to coercion. The antithesis is\r\nframed with all the ingenuity which is characteristic of my honourable\r\nfriend's style; but I cannot help thinking that, on this occasion,\r\nhis ingenuity has imposed on himself, and that he has not sufficiently\r\nconsidered the meaning of the pointed phrase which he used with so much\r\neffect. Redress is no doubt a very well sounding word. What can be more\r\nreasonable than to ask for redress? What more unjust than to refuse\r\nredress? But my honourable friend will perceive, on reflection, that,\r\nthough he and the honourable and learned Member for Dublin agree in\r\npronouncing the word redress, they agree in nothing else. They utter the\r\nsame sound; but they attach to it two diametrically opposite meanings.\r\nThe honourable and learned Member for Dublin means by redress simply\r\nthe Repeal of the Union. Now, to the Repeal of the Union my honourable\r\nfriend the Member for Lincoln is decidedly adverse. When we get at his\r\nreal meaning, we find that he is just as unwilling as we are to give the\r\nredress which the honourable and learned Member for Dublin demands. Only\r\na small minority of the House will, I hope, and believe, vote with that\r\nhonourable and learned member; but the minority which thinks with him\r\nwill be very much smaller.\r\n\r\nWe have, indeed, been told by some gentlemen, who are not themselves\r\nrepealers, that the question of Repeal deserves a much more serious\r\nconsideration than it has yet received. Repeal, they say, is an object\r\non which millions have, however unwisely, set their hearts; and men\r\nwho speak in the name of millions are not to be coughed down or sneered\r\ndown. That which a suffering nation regards, rightly or wrongly, as the\r\nsole cure for all its distempers, ought not to be treated with levity,\r\nbut to be the subject of full and solemn debate. All this, Sir, is most\r\ntrue: but I am surprised that this lecture should have been read to\r\nus who sit on your right. It would, I apprehend, have been with more\r\npropriety addressed to a different quarter. Whose fault is it that we\r\nhave not yet had, and that there is no prospect of our having, this full\r\nand solemn debate? Is it the fault of His Majesty's Ministers? Have\r\nnot they framed the Speech which their Royal Master delivered from the\r\nthrone, in such a manner as to invite the grave and searching discussion\r\nof the question of Repeal? and has not the invitation been declined? Is\r\nit not fresh in our recollection that the honourable and learned Member\r\nfor Dublin spoke two hours, perhaps three hours,--nobody keeps accurate\r\naccount of time while he speaks,--but two or three hours without\r\nventuring to join issue with us on this subject? In truth, he suffered\r\njudgment to go against him by default. We, on this side of the House,\r\ndid our best to provoke him to the conflict. We called on him to\r\nmaintain here those doctrines which he had proclaimed elsewhere with so\r\nmuch vehemence, and, I am sorry to be forced to add, with a scurrility\r\nunworthy of his parts and eloquence. Never was a challenge more fairly\r\ngiven: but it was not accepted. The great champion of Repeal would not\r\nlift our glove. He shrank back; he skulked away; not, assuredly, from\r\ndistrust of his powers, which have never been more vigorously exerted\r\nthan in this debate, but evidently from distrust of his cause. I have\r\nseldom heard so able a speech as his: I certainly never heard a speech\r\nso evasive. From the beginning to the end he studiously avoided saying\r\na single word tending to raise a discussion about that Repeal which, in\r\nother places, he constantly affirms to be the sole panacea for all the\r\nevils by which his country is afflicted. Nor is this all. Yesterday\r\nnight he placed on our order-book not less than fourteen notices; and\r\nof those notices not a single one had any reference to the Union between\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland. It is therefore evident to me, not only that\r\nthe honourable and learned gentleman is not now prepared to debate the\r\nquestion in this House, but that he has no intention of debating it in\r\nthis House at all. He keeps it, and prudently keeps it, for audiences of\r\na very different kind. I am therefore, I repeat, surprised to hear\r\nthe Government accused of avoiding the discussion of this subject. Why\r\nshould we avoid a battle in which the bold and skilful captain of the\r\nenemy evidently knows that we must be victorious?\r\n\r\nOne gentleman, though not a repealer, has begged us not to declare\r\nourselves decidedly adverse to repeal till we have studied the petitions\r\nwhich are coming in from Ireland. Really, Sir, this is not a subject on\r\nwhich any public man ought to be now making up his mind. My mind is made\r\nup. My reasons are such as, I am certain, no petition from Ireland will\r\nconfute. Those reasons have long been ready to be produced; and, since\r\nwe are accused of flinching, I will at once produce them. I am prepared\r\nto show that the Repeal of the Union would not remove the political and\r\nsocial evils which afflict Ireland, nay, that it would aggravate almost\r\nevery one of those evils.\r\n\r\nI understand, though I do not approve, the proceedings of poor Wolfe\r\nTone and his confederates. They wished to make a complete separation\r\nbetween Great Britain and Ireland. They wished to establish a Hibernian\r\nrepublic. Their plan was a very bad one; but, to do them justice, it\r\nwas perfectly consistent; and an ingenious man might defend it by some\r\nplausible arguments. But that is not the plan of the honourable and\r\nlearned Member for Dublin. He assures us that he wishes the connection\r\nbetween the islands to be perpetual. He is for a complete separation\r\nbetween the two Parliaments; but he is for indissoluble union between\r\nthe two Crowns. Nor does the honourable and learned gentleman mean, by\r\nan union between the Crowns, such an union as exists between the Crown\r\nof this kingdom and the Crown of Hanover. For I need not say that,\r\nthough the same person is king of Great Britain and of Hanover, there\r\nis no more political connection between Great Britain and Hanover than\r\nbetween Great Britain and Hesse, or between Great Britain and Bavaria.\r\nHanover may be at peace with a state with which Great Britain is at war.\r\nNay, Hanover may, as a member of the Germanic body, send a contingent of\r\ntroops to cross bayonets with the King's English footguards. This is not\r\nthe relation in which the honourable and learned gentleman proposes that\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland should stand to each other. His plan is, that\r\neach of the two countries shall have an independent legislature, but\r\nthat both shall have the same executive government. Now, is it possible\r\nthat a mind so acute and so well informed as his should not at\r\nonce perceive that this plan involves an absurdity, a downright\r\ncontradiction. Two independent legislatures! One executive government!\r\nHow can the thing be? No doubt, if the legislative power were quite\r\ndistinct from the executive power, England and Ireland might as easily\r\nhave two legislatures as two Chancellors and two Courts of King's Bench.\r\nBut though, in books written by theorists, the executive power and the\r\nlegislative power may be treated as things quite distinct, every man\r\nacquainted with the real working of our constitution knows that the two\r\npowers are most closely connected, nay, intermingled with each other.\r\nDuring several generations, the whole administration of affairs has\r\nbeen conducted in conformity with the sense of Parliament. About\r\nevery exercise of the prerogative of the Crown it is the privilege\r\nof Parliament to offer advice; and that advice no wise king will\r\never slight. It is the prerogative of the Sovereign to choose his own\r\nservants; but it is impossible for him to maintain them in office unless\r\nParliament will support them. It is the prerogative of the Sovereign to\r\ntreat with other princes; but it is impossible for him to persist in any\r\nscheme of foreign policy which is disagreeable to Parliament. It is\r\nthe prerogative of the Sovereign to make war; but he cannot raise a\r\nbattalion or man a frigate without the help of Parliament. The repealers\r\nmay therefore be refuted out of their own mouths. They say that\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland ought to have one executive power. But\r\nthe legislature has a most important share of the executive power.\r\nTherefore, by the confession of the repealers themselves, Great Britain\r\nand Ireland ought to have one legislature.\r\n\r\nConsider for one moment in what a situation the executive government\r\nwill be placed if you have two independent legislatures, and if those\r\nlegislatures should differ, as all bodies which are independent of each\r\nother will sometimes differ. Suppose the case of a commercial treaty\r\nwhich is unpopular in England and popular in Ireland. The Irish\r\nParliament expresses its approbation of the terms, and passes a vote\r\nof thanks to the negotiator. We at Westminster censure the terms and\r\nimpeach the negotiator. Or are we to have two foreign offices, one in\r\nDowning Street and one in Dublin Castle? Is His Majesty to send to every\r\ncourt in Christendom two diplomatic agents, to thwart each other, and\r\nto be spies upon each other? It is inconceivable but that, in a very\r\nfew years, disputes such as can be terminated only by arms must arise\r\nbetween communities so absurdly united and so absurdly disunited. All\r\nhistory confirms this reasoning. Superficial observers have fancied that\r\nthey had found cases on the other side. But as soon as you examine those\r\ncases you will see either that they bear no analogy to the case with\r\nwhich we have to deal, or that they corroborate my argument. The case\r\nof Ireland herself has been cited. Ireland, it has been said, had an\r\nindependent legislature from 1782 to 1800: during eighteen years there\r\nwere two coequal parliaments under one Crown; and yet there was no\r\ncollision. Sir, the reason that there was not perpetual collision was,\r\nas we all know, that the Irish parliament, though nominally independent,\r\nwas generally kept in real dependence by means of the foulest corruption\r\nthat ever existed in any assembly. But it is not true that there was no\r\ncollision. Before the Irish legislature had been six years independent,\r\na collision did take place, a collision such as might well have produced\r\na civil war. In the year 1788, George the Third was incapacitated\r\nby illness from discharging his regal functions. According to the\r\nconstitution, the duty of making provision for the discharge of those\r\nfunctions devolved on the parliaments of Great Britain and Ireland.\r\nBetween the government of Great Britain and the government of Ireland\r\nthere was, during the interregnum, no connection whatever. The sovereign\r\nwho was the common head of both governments had virtually ceased to\r\nexist: and the two legislatures were no more to each other than\r\nthis House and the Chamber of Deputies at Paris. What followed? The\r\nParliament of Great Britain resolved to offer the Regency to the Prince\r\nof Wales under many important restrictions. The Parliament of Ireland\r\nmade him an offer of the Regency without any restrictions whatever. By\r\nthe same right by which the Irish Lords and Commons made that offer,\r\nthey might, if Mr Pitt's doctrine be the constitutional doctrine, as\r\nI believe it to be, have made the Duke of York or the Duke of Leinster\r\nRegent. To this Regent they might have given all the prerogatives of the\r\nKing. Suppose,--no extravagant supposition,--that George the Third\r\nhad not recovered, that the rest of his long life had been passed\r\nin seclusion, Great Britain and Ireland would then have been, during\r\nthirty-two years, as completely separated as Great Britain and Spain.\r\nThere would have been nothing in common between the governments, neither\r\nexecutive power nor legislative power. It is plain, therefore, that a\r\ntotal separation between the two islands might, in the natural course of\r\nthings, and without the smallest violation of the constitution on either\r\nside, be the effect of the arrangement recommended by the honourable and\r\nlearned gentleman, who solemnly declares that he should consider such a\r\nseparation as the greatest of calamities.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, Sir, in several continental kingdoms there have been two\r\nlegislatures, and indeed more than two legislatures, under the same\r\nCrown. But the explanation is simple. Those legislatures were of no real\r\nweight in the government. Under Louis the Fourteenth Brittany had its\r\nStates; Burgundy had its States; and yet there was no collision between\r\nthe States of Brittany and the States of Burgundy. But why? Because\r\nneither the States of Brittany nor the States of Burgundy imposed\r\nany real restraint on the arbitrary power of the monarch. So, in\r\nthe dominions of the House of Hapsburg, there is the semblance of a\r\nlegislature in Hungary and the semblance of a legislature in the Tyrol:\r\nbut all the real power is with the Emperor. I do not say that you cannot\r\nhave one executive power and two mock parliaments, two parliaments which\r\nmerely transact parish business, two parliaments which exercise no more\r\ninfluence on great affairs of state than the vestry of St Pancras or the\r\nvestry of Marylebone. What I do say, and what common sense teaches, and\r\nwhat all history teaches, is this, that you cannot have one executive\r\npower and two real parliaments, two parliaments possessing such\r\npowers as the parliament of this country has possessed ever since\r\nthe Revolution, two parliaments to the deliberate sense of which the\r\nSovereign must conform. If they differ, how can he conform to the sense\r\nof both? The thing is as plain as a proposition in Euclid.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for me to believe that considerations so obvious and so\r\nimportant should not have occurred to the honourable and learned Member\r\nfor Dublin. Doubtless they have occurred to him; and therefore it\r\nis that he shrinks from arguing the question here. Nay, even when he\r\nharangues more credulous assemblies on the subject, he carefully avoids\r\nprecise explanations; and the hints which sometimes escape him are\r\nnot easily to be reconciled with each other. On one occasion, if\r\nthe newspapers are to be trusted, he declared that his object was to\r\nestablish a federal union between Great Britain and Ireland. A local\r\nparliament, it seems, is to sit at Dublin, and to send deputies to an\r\nimperial parliament which is to sit at Westminster. The honourable and\r\nlearned gentleman thinks, I suppose, that in this way he evades the\r\ndifficulties which I have pointed out. But he deceives himself.\r\nIf, indeed, his local legislature is to be subject to his imperial\r\nlegislature, if his local legislature is to be merely what the Assembly\r\nof Antigua or Barbadoes is, or what the Irish Parliament was before\r\n1782, the danger of collision is no doubt removed: but what, on the\r\nhonourable and learned gentleman's own principles, would Ireland gain by\r\nsuch an arrangement? If, on the other hand, his local legislature is\r\nto be for certain purposes independent, you have again the risk of\r\ncollision. Suppose that a difference of opinion should arise between the\r\nImperial Parliament and the Irish Parliament as to the limits of their\r\npowers, who is to decide between them? A dispute between the House of\r\nCommons and the House of Lords is bad enough. Yet in that case, the\r\nSovereign can, by a high exercise of his prerogative, produce harmony.\r\nHe can send us back to our constituents; and, if that expedient fails,\r\nhe can create more lords. When, in 1705, the dispute between the\r\nHouses about the Aylesbury men ran high, Queen Anne restored concord by\r\ndismissing the Parliament. Seven years later she put an end to another\r\nconflict between the Houses by making twelve peers in one day. But who\r\nis to arbitrate between two representative bodies chosen by different\r\nconstituent bodies? Look at what is now passing in America. Of all\r\nfederal constitutions that of the United States is the best. It was\r\nframed by a convention which contained many wise and experienced men,\r\nand over which Washington presided. Yet there is a debateable ground on\r\nthe frontier which separates the functions of Congress from those of\r\nthe state legislatures. A dispute as to the exact boundary has lately\r\narisen. Neither party seems disposed to yield: and, if both persist,\r\nthere can be no umpire but the sword.\r\n\r\nFor my part, Sir, I have no hesitation in saying that I should very\r\ngreatly prefer the total separation which the honourable and learned\r\ngentleman professes to consider as a calamity, to the partial separation\r\nwhich he has taught his countrymen to regard as a blessing. If, on a\r\nfair trial, it be found that Great Britain and Ireland cannot exist\r\nhappily together as parts of one empire, in God's name let them\r\nseparate. I wish to see them joined as the limbs of a well formed body\r\nare joined. In such a body the members assist each other: they are\r\nnourished by the same food: if one member suffer, all suffer with it:\r\nif one member rejoice, all rejoice with it. But I do not wish to see the\r\ncountries united, like those wretched twins from Siam who were exhibited\r\nhere a little while ago, by an unnatural ligament which made each the\r\nconstant plague of the other, always in each other's way, more helpless\r\nthan others because they had twice as many hands, slower than others\r\nbecause they had twice as many legs, sympathising with each other only\r\nin evil, not feeling each other's pleasures, not supported by each\r\nother's aliments, but tormented by each other's infirmities, and certain\r\nto perish miserably by each other's dissolution.\r\n\r\nIreland has undoubtedly just causes of complaint. We heard those causes\r\nrecapitulated last night by the honourable and learned Member, who tells\r\nus that he represents not Dublin alone, but Ireland, and that he stands\r\nbetween his country and civil war. I do not deny that most of the\r\ngrievances which he recounted exist, that they are serious, and that\r\nthey ought to be remedied as far as it is in the power of legislation to\r\nremedy them. What I do deny is that they were caused by the Union, and\r\nthat the Repeal of the Union would remove them. I listened attentively\r\nwhile the honourable and learned gentleman went through that long and\r\nmelancholy list: and I am confident that he did not mention a single\r\nevil which was not a subject of bitter complaint while Ireland had a\r\ndomestic parliament. Is it fair, is it reasonable in the honourable\r\ngentleman to impute to the Union evils which, as he knows better than\r\nany other man in this house, existed long before the Union? Post hoc:\r\nergo, propter hoc is not always sound reasoning. But ante hoc: ergo,\r\nnon propter hoc is unanswerable. The old rustic who told Sir Thomas\r\nMore that Tenterden steeple was the cause of Godwin sands reasoned much\r\nbetter than the honourable and learned gentleman. For it was not till\r\nafter Tenterden steeple was built that the frightful wrecks on the\r\nGodwin sands were heard of. But the honourable and learned gentleman\r\nwould make Godwin sands the cause of Tenterden steeple. Some of the\r\nIrish grievances which he ascribes to the Union are not only older than\r\nthe Union, but are not peculiarly Irish. They are common to England,\r\nScotland, and Ireland; and it was in order to get rid of them that we,\r\nfor the common benefit of England, Scotland, and Ireland, passed the\r\nReform Bill last year. Other grievances which the honourable and learned\r\ngentleman mentioned are doubtless local; but is there to be a local\r\nlegislature wherever there is a local grievance? Wales has had local\r\ngrievances. We all remember the complaints which were made a few years\r\nago about the Welsh judicial system; but did anybody therefore propose\r\nthat Wales should have a distinct parliament? Cornwall has some local\r\ngrievances; but does anybody propose that Cornwall shall have its own\r\nHouse of Lords and its own House of Commons? Leeds has local grievances.\r\nThe majority of my constituents distrust and dislike the municipal\r\ngovernment to which they are subject; they therefore call loudly on\r\nus for corporation reform: but they do not ask us for a separate\r\nlegislature. Of this I am quite sure, that every argument which has been\r\nurged for the purpose of showing that Great Britain and Ireland ought\r\nto have two distinct parliaments may be urged with far greater force\r\nfor the purpose of showing that the north of Ireland and the south of\r\nIreland ought to have two distinct parliaments. The House of Commons of\r\nthe United Kingdom, it has been said, is chiefly elected by Protestants,\r\nand therefore cannot be trusted to legislate for Catholic Ireland.\r\nIf this be so, how can an Irish House of Commons, chiefly elected\r\nby Catholics, be trusted to legislate for Protestant Ulster? It is\r\nperfectly notorious that theological antipathies are stronger in Ireland\r\nthan here. I appeal to the honourable and learned gentleman himself. He\r\nhas often declared that it is impossible for a Roman Catholic, whether\r\nprosecutor or culprit, to obtain justice from a jury of Orangemen. It\r\nis indeed certain that, in blood, religion, language, habits, character,\r\nthe population of some of the northern counties of Ireland has much\r\nmore in common with the population of England and Scotland than with the\r\npopulation of Munster and Connaught. I defy the honourable and learned\r\nMember, therefore, to find a reason for having a parliament at Dublin\r\nwhich will not be just as good a reason for having another parliament at\r\nLondonderry.\r\n\r\nSir, in showing, as I think I have shown, the absurdity of this cry for\r\nRepeal, I have in a great measure vindicated myself from the charge of\r\ninconsistency which has been brought against me by my honourable friend\r\nthe Member for Lincoln. It is very easy to bring a volume of Hansard to\r\nthe House, to read a few sentences of a speech made in very different\r\ncircumstances, and to say, \"Last year you were for pacifying England by\r\nconcession: this year you are for pacifying Ireland by coercion. How can\r\nyou vindicate your consistency?\" Surely my honourable friend cannot\r\nbut know that nothing is easier than to write a theme for severity, for\r\nclemency, for order, for liberty, for a contemplative life, for a active\r\nlife, and so on. It was a common exercise in the ancient schools of\r\nrhetoric to take an abstract question, and to harangue first on one side\r\nand then on the other. The question, Ought popular discontents to be\r\nquieted by concession or coercion? would have been a very good subject\r\nfor oratory of this kind. There is no lack of commonplaces on either\r\nside. But when we come to the real business of life, the value of these\r\ncommonplaces depends entirely on the particular circumstances of the\r\ncase which we are discussing. Nothing is easier than to write a treatise\r\nproving that it is lawful to resist extreme tyranny. Nothing is easier\r\nthan to write a treatise setting forth the wickedness of wantonly\r\nbringing on a great society the miseries inseparable from revolution,\r\nthe bloodshed, the spoliation, the anarchy. Both treatises may contain\r\nmuch that is true; but neither will enable us to decide whether a\r\nparticular insurrection is or is not justifiable without a close\r\nexamination of the facts. There is surely no inconsistency in speaking\r\nwith respect of the memory of Lord Russell and with horror of the crime\r\nof Thistlewood; and, in my opinion, the conduct of Russell and the\r\nconduct of Thistlewood did not differ more widely than the cry for\r\nParliamentary Reform and the cry for the Repeal of the Union. The Reform\r\nBill I believe to be a blessing to the nation. Repeal I know to be a\r\nmere delusion. I know it to be impracticable: and I know that, if it\r\nwere practicable, it would be pernicious to every part of the empire,\r\nand utterly ruinous to Ireland. Is it not then absurd to say that,\r\nbecause I wished last year to quiet the English people by giving them\r\nthat which was beneficial to them, I am therefore bound in consistency\r\nto quiet the Irish people this year by giving them that which will\r\nbe fatal to them? I utterly deny, too, that, in consenting to arm the\r\ngovernment with extraordinary powers for the purpose of repressing\r\ndisturbances in Ireland, I am guilty of the smallest inconsistency. On\r\nwhat occasion did I ever refuse to support any government in repressing\r\ndisturbances? It is perfectly true that, in the debates on the Reform\r\nBill, I imputed the tumults and outrages of 1830 to misrule. But did I\r\never say that those tumults and outrages ought to be tolerated? I did\r\nattribute the Kentish riots, the Hampshire riots, the burning of corn\r\nstacks, the destruction of threshing machines, to the obstinacy with\r\nwhich the Ministers of the Crown had refused to listen to the demands\r\nof the people. But did I ever say that the rioters ought not to be\r\nimprisoned, that the incendiaries ought not to be hanged? I did ascribe\r\nthe disorders of Nottingham and the fearful sacking of Bristol to the\r\nunwise rejection of the Reform Bill by the Lords. But did I ever say\r\nthat such excesses as were committed at Nottingham and Bristol ought not\r\nto be put down, if necessary, by the sword?\r\n\r\nI would act towards Ireland on the same principles on which I acted\r\ntowards England. In Ireland, as in England, I would remove every just\r\ncause of complaint; and in Ireland, as in England, I would support the\r\nGovernment in preserving the public peace. What is there inconsistent\r\nin this? My honourable friend seems to think that no person who believes\r\nthat disturbances have been caused by maladministration can consistently\r\nlend his help to put down those disturbances. If that be so, the\r\nhonourable and learned Member for Dublin is quite as inconsistent as\r\nI am; indeed, much more so; for he thinks very much worse of the\r\nGovernment than I do; and yet he declares himself willing to assist\r\nthe Government in quelling the tumults which, as he assures us, its own\r\nmisconduct is likely to produce. He told us yesterday that our harsh\r\npolicy might perhaps goad the unthinking populace of Ireland into\r\ninsurrection; and he added that, if there should be insurrection, he\r\nshould, while execrating us as the authors of all the mischief, be found\r\nin our ranks, and should be ready to support us in everything that\r\nmight be necessary for the restoration of order. As to this part of the\r\nsubject, there is no difference in principle between the honourable and\r\nlearned gentleman and myself. In his opinion, it is probable that a time\r\nmay soon come when vigorous coercion may be necessary, and when it may\r\nbe the duty of every friend of Ireland to co-operate in the work of\r\ncoercion. In my opinion, that time has already come. The grievances of\r\nIreland are doubtless great, so great that I never would have connected\r\nmyself with a Government which I did not believe to be intent on\r\nredressing those grievances. But am I, because the grievances of Ireland\r\nare great, and ought to be redressed, to abstain from redressing the\r\nworst grievance of all? Am I to look on quietly while the laws are\r\ninsulted by a furious rabble, while houses are plundered and burned,\r\nwhile my peaceable fellow-subjects are butchered? The distribution of\r\nChurch property, you tell us, is unjust. Perhaps I agree with you.\r\nBut what then? To what purpose is it to talk about the distribution of\r\nChurch property, while no property is secure? Then you try to deter us\r\nfrom putting down robbery, arson, and murder, by telling us that if we\r\nresort to coercion we shall raise a civil war. We are past that fear.\r\nRecollect that, in one county alone, there have been within a few\r\nweeks sixty murders or assaults with intent to murder and six hundred\r\nburglaries. Since we parted last summer the slaughter in Ireland has\r\nexceeded the slaughter of a pitched battle: the destruction of property\r\nhas been as great as would have been caused by the storming of three or\r\nfour towns. Civil war, indeed! I would rather live in the midst of any\r\ncivil war that we have had in England during the last two hundred\r\nyears than in some parts of Ireland at the present moment. Rather, much\r\nrather, would I have lived on the line of march of the Pretender's army\r\nin 1745 than in Tipperary now. It is idle to threaten us with civil war;\r\nfor we have it already; and it is because we are resolved to put an\r\nend to it that we are called base, and brutal, and bloody. Such are the\r\nepithets which the honourable and learned Member for Dublin thinks\r\nit becoming to pour forth against the party to which he owes every\r\npolitical privilege that he enjoys. He need not fear that any member\r\nof that party will be provoked into a conflict of scurrility. Use\r\nmakes even sensitive minds callous to invective: and, copious as his\r\nvocabulary is, he will not easily find in it any foul name which has not\r\nbeen many times applied to those who sit around me, on account of the\r\nzeal and steadiness with which they supported the emancipation of\r\nthe Roman Catholics. His reproaches are not more stinging than the\r\nreproaches which, in times not very remote, we endured unflinchingly in\r\nhis cause. I can assure him that men who faced the cry of No Popery are\r\nnot likely to be scared by the cry of Repeal. The time will come when\r\nhistory will do justice to the Whigs of England, and will faithfully\r\nrelate how much they did and suffered for Ireland; how, for the sake of\r\nIreland, they quitted office in 1807; how, for the sake of Ireland, they\r\nremained out of office more than twenty years, braving the frowns of\r\nthe Court, braving the hisses of the multitude, renouncing power,\r\nand patronage, and salaries, and peerages, and garters, and yet not\r\nobtaining in return even a little fleeting popularity. I see on the\r\nbenches near me men who might, by uttering one word against Catholic\r\nEmancipation, nay, by merely abstaining from uttering a word in favour\r\nof Catholic Emancipation, have been returned to this House without\r\ndifficulty or expense, and who, rather than wrong their Irish\r\nfellow-subjects, were content to relinquish all the objects of their\r\nhonourable ambition, and to retire into private life with conscience\r\nand fame untarnished. As to one eminent person, who seems to be regarded\r\nwith especial malevolence by those who ought never to mention his name\r\nwithout reverence and gratitude, I will say only this: that the loudest\r\nclamour which the honourable and learned gentleman can excite against\r\nLord Grey will be trifling when compared with the clamour which Lord\r\nGrey withstood in order to place the honourable and learned gentleman\r\nwhere he now sits. Though a young member of the Whig party, I will\r\nventure to speak in the name of the whole body. I tell the honourable\r\nand learned gentleman, that the same spirit which sustained us in a just\r\ncontest for him will sustain us in an equally just contest against him.\r\nCalumny, abuse, royal displeasure, popular fury, exclusion from office,\r\nexclusion from Parliament, we were ready to endure them all, rather than\r\nthat he should be less than a British subject. We never will suffer him\r\nto be more.\r\n\r\nI stand here, Sir, for the first time as the representative of a\r\nnew constituent body, one of the largest, most prosperous, and most\r\nenlightened towns in the kingdom. The electors of Leeds, believing that\r\nat this time the service of the people is not incompatible with the\r\nservice of the Crown, have sent me to this House charged, in the\r\nlanguage of His Majesty's writ, to do and consent, in their name and in\r\ntheir behalf, to such things as shall be proposed in the great Council\r\nof the nation. In the name, then, and on the behalf of my constituents,\r\nI give my full assent to that part of the Address wherein the House\r\ndeclares its resolution to maintain inviolate, by the help of God, the\r\nconnection between Great Britain and Ireland, and to intrust to the\r\nSovereign such powers as shall be necessary to secure property, to\r\nrestore order, and to preserve the integrity of the empire.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEWISH DISABILITIES. (APRIL 17, 1833) A SPEECH DELIVERED IN A COMMITTEE\r\nOF THE WHOLE HOUSE OF COMMONS ON THE 17TH OF APRIL, 1833.\r\n\r\nOn the seventeenth of April, 1833, the House of Commons resolved itself\r\ninto a Committee to consider of the civil disabilities of the Jews.\r\nMr Warburton took the chair. Mr Robert Grant moved the following\r\nresolution:--\r\n\r\n\"That it is the opinion of this Committee that it is expedient to remove\r\nall civil disabilities at present existing with respect to His Majesty's\r\nsubjects professing the Jewish religion, with the like exceptions as\r\nare provided with respect to His Majesty's subjects professing the Roman\r\nCatholic religion.\"\r\n\r\nThe resolution passed without a division, after a warm debate, in the\r\ncourse of which the following Speech was made.\r\n\r\nMr Warburton,--I recollect, and my honourable friend the Member for\r\nthe University of Oxford will recollect, that when this subject was\r\ndiscussed three years ago, it was remarked, by one whom we both loved\r\nand whom we both regret, that the strength of the case of the Jews was a\r\nserious inconvenience to their advocate, for that it was hardly possible\r\nto make a speech for them without wearying the audience by repeating\r\ntruths which were universally admitted. If Sir James Mackintosh felt\r\nthis difficulty when the question was first brought forward in this\r\nHouse, I may well despair of being able now to offer any arguments which\r\nhave a pretence to novelty.\r\n\r\nMy honourable friend, the Member for the University of Oxford, began his\r\nspeech by declaring that he had no intention of calling in question the\r\nprinciples of religious liberty. He utterly disclaims persecution, that\r\nis to say, persecution as defined by himself. It would, in his opinion,\r\nbe persecution to hang a Jew, or to flay him, or to draw his teeth,\r\nor to imprison him, or to fine him; for every man who conducts himself\r\npeaceably has a right to his life and his limbs, to his personal liberty\r\nand his property. But it is not persecution, says my honourable friend,\r\nto exclude any individual or any class from office; for nobody has a\r\nright to office: in every country official appointments must be subject\r\nto such regulations as the supreme authority may choose to make; nor can\r\nany such regulations be reasonably complained of by any member of the\r\nsociety as unjust. He who obtains an office obtains it, not as matter of\r\nright, but as matter of favour. He who does not obtain an office is\r\nnot wronged; he is only in that situation in which the vast majority\r\nof every community must necessarily be. There are in the United Kingdom\r\nfive and twenty million Christians without places; and, if they do not\r\ncomplain, why should five and twenty thousand Jews complain of being in\r\nthe same case? In this way my honourable friend has convinced himself\r\nthat, as it would be most absurd in him and me to say that we are\r\nwronged because we are not Secretaries of State, so it is most absurd\r\nin the Jews to say that they are wronged, because they are, as a people,\r\nexcluded from public employment.\r\n\r\nNow, surely my honourable friend cannot have considered to what\r\nconclusions his reasoning leads. Those conclusions are so monstrous that\r\nhe would, I am certain, shrink from them. Does he really mean that it\r\nwould not be wrong in the legislature to enact that no man should be\r\na judge unless he weighed twelve stone, or that no man should sit in\r\nparliament unless he were six feet high? We are about to bring in a bill\r\nfor the government of India. Suppose that we were to insert in that bill\r\na clause providing that no graduate of the University of Oxford\r\nshould be Governor General or Governor of any Presidency, would not my\r\nhonourable friend cry out against such a clause as most unjust to\r\nthe learned body which he represents? And would he think himself\r\nsufficiently answered by being told, in his own words, that the\r\nappointment to office is a mere matter of favour, and that to exclude\r\nan individual or a class from office is no injury? Surely, on\r\nconsideration, he must admit that official appointments ought not to\r\nbe subject to regulations purely arbitrary, to regulations for which no\r\nreason can be given but mere caprice, and that those who would exclude\r\nany class from public employment are bound to show some special reason\r\nfor the exclusion.\r\n\r\nMy honourable friend has appealed to us as Christians. Let me then ask\r\nhim how he understands that great commandment which comprises the law\r\nand the prophets. Can we be said to do unto others as we would that they\r\nshould do unto us if we wantonly inflict on them even the smallest\r\npain? As Christians, surely we are bound to consider, first, whether,\r\nby excluding the Jews from all public trust, we give them pain; and,\r\nsecondly, whether it be necessary to give them that pain in order to\r\navert some greater evil. That by excluding them from public trust\r\nwe inflict pain on them my honourable friend will not dispute. As a\r\nChristian, therefore, he is bound to relieve them from that pain, unless\r\nhe can show, what I am sure he has not yet shown, that it is necessary\r\nto the general good that they should continue to suffer.\r\n\r\nBut where, he says, are you to stop, if once you admit into the House of\r\nCommons people who deny the authority of the Gospels? Will you let in\r\na Mussulman? Will you let in a Parsee? Will you let in a Hindoo, who\r\nworships a lump of stone with seven heads? I will answer my honourable\r\nfriend's question by another. Where does he mean to stop? Is he ready to\r\nroast unbelievers at slow fires? If not, let him tell us why: and I\r\nwill engage to prove that his reason is just as decisive against the\r\nintolerance which he thinks a duty, as against the intolerance which he\r\nthinks a crime. Once admit that we are bound to inflict pain on a man\r\nbecause he is not of our religion; and where are you to stop? Why stop\r\nat the point fixed by my honourable friend rather than at the point\r\nfixed by the honourable Member for Oldham (Mr Cobbett.), who would make\r\nthe Jews incapable of holding land? And why stop at the point fixed by\r\nthe honourable Member for Oldham rather than at the point which would\r\nhave been fixed by a Spanish Inquisitor of the sixteenth century? When\r\nonce you enter on a course of persecution, I defy you to find any reason\r\nfor making a halt till you have reached the extreme point. When my\r\nhonourable friend tells us that he will allow the Jews to possess\r\nproperty to any amount, but that he will not allow them to possess the\r\nsmallest political power, he holds contradictory language. Property\r\nis power. The honourable Member for Oldham reasons better than my\r\nhonourable friend. The honourable Member for Oldham sees very clearly\r\nthat it is impossible to deprive a man of political power if you\r\nsuffer him to be the proprietor of half a county, and therefore very\r\nconsistently proposes to confiscate the landed estates of the Jews. But\r\neven the honourable Member for Oldham does not go far enough. He has\r\nnot proposed to confiscate the personal property of the Jews. Yet it is\r\nperfectly certain that any Jew who has a million may easily make himself\r\nvery important in the State. By such steps we pass from official power\r\nto landed property, and from landed property to personal property, and\r\nfrom property to liberty, and from liberty to life. In truth, those\r\npersecutors who use the rack and the stake have much to say for\r\nthemselves. They are convinced that their end is good; and it must be\r\nadmitted that they employ means which are not unlikely to attain the\r\nend. Religious dissent has repeatedly been put down by sanguinary\r\npersecution. In that way the Albigenses were put down. In that way\r\nProtestantism was suppressed in Spain and Italy, so that it has never\r\nsince reared its head. But I defy any body to produce an instance in\r\nwhich disabilities such as we are now considering have produced any\r\nother effect than that of making the sufferers angry and obstinate.\r\nMy honourable friend should either persecute to some purpose, or not\r\npersecute at all. He dislikes the word persecution I know. He will not\r\nadmit that the Jews are persecuted. And yet I am confident that he would\r\nrather be sent to the King's Bench Prison for three months, or be fined\r\na hundred pounds, than be subject to the disabilities under which the\r\nJews lie. How can he then say that to impose such disabilities is not\r\npersecution, and that to fine and imprison is persecution? All his\r\nreasoning consists in drawing arbitrary lines. What he does not wish to\r\ninflict he calls persecution. What he does wish to inflict he will not\r\ncall persecution. What he takes from the Jews he calls political power.\r\nWhat he is too good-natured to take from the Jews he will not call\r\npolitical power. The Jew must not sit in Parliament: but he may be the\r\nproprietor of all the ten pound houses in a borough. He may have more\r\nfifty pound tenants than any peer in the kingdom. He may give the voters\r\ntreats to please their palates, and hire bands of gipsies to break their\r\nheads, as if he were a Christian and a Marquess. All the rest of this\r\nsystem is of a piece. The Jew may be a juryman, but not a judge. He\r\nmay decide issues of fact, but not issues of law. He may give a hundred\r\nthousand pounds damages; but he may not in the most trivial case grant a\r\nnew trial. He may rule the money market: he may influence the\r\nexchanges: he may be summoned to congresses of Emperors and Kings. Great\r\npotentates, instead of negotiating a loan with him by tying him in a\r\nchair and pulling out his grinders, may treat with him as with a great\r\npotentate, and may postpone the declaring of war or the signing of a\r\ntreaty till they have conferred with him. All this is as it should\r\nbe: but he must not be a Privy Councillor. He must not be called Right\r\nHonourable, for that is political power. And who is it that we are\r\ntrying to cheat in this way? Even Omniscience. Yes, Sir; we have been\r\ngravely told that the Jews are under the divine displeasure, and that if\r\nwe give them political power God will visit us in judgment. Do we then\r\nthink that God cannot distinguish between substance and form? Does not\r\nHe know that, while we withhold from the Jews the semblance and name\r\nof political power, we suffer them to possess the substance? The plain\r\ntruth is that my honourable friend is drawn in one direction by his\r\nopinions, and in a directly opposite direction by his excellent heart.\r\nHe halts between two opinions. He tries to make a compromise between\r\nprinciples which admit of no compromise. He goes a certain way in\r\nintolerance. Then he stops, without being able to give a reason for\r\nstopping. But I know the reason. It is his humanity. Those who formerly\r\ndragged the Jew at a horse's tail, and singed his beard with blazing\r\nfurzebushes, were much worse men than my honourable friend; but they\r\nwere more consistent than he.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that it would be monstrous to see a Jew judge try a man\r\nfor blasphemy. In my opinion it is monstrous to see any judge try a man\r\nfor blasphemy under the present law. But, if the law on that subject\r\nwere in a sound state, I do not see why a conscientious Jew might not\r\ntry a blasphemer. Every man, I think, ought to be at liberty to discuss\r\nthe evidences of religion; but no man ought to be at liberty to force on\r\nthe unwilling ears and eyes of others sounds and sights which must cause\r\nannoyance and irritation. The distinction is clear. I think it wrong to\r\npunish a man for selling Paine's Age of Reason in a back-shop to those\r\nwho choose to buy, or for delivering a Deistical lecture in a private\r\nroom to those who choose to listen. But if a man exhibits at a window\r\nin the Strand a hideous caricature of that which is an object of awe\r\nand adoration to nine hundred and ninety-nine out of every thousand of\r\npeople who pass up and down that great thoroughfare; if a man in a place\r\nof public resort applies opprobrious epithets to names held in reverence\r\nby all Christians; such a man ought, in my opinion, to be severely\r\npunished, not for differing from us in opinion, but for committing a\r\nnuisance which gives us pain and disgust. He is no more entitled to\r\noutrage our feelings by obtruding his impiety on us, and to say that\r\nhe is exercising his right of discussion, than to establish a yard for\r\nbutchering horses close to our houses, and to say that he is exercising\r\nhis right of property, or to run naked up and down the public streets,\r\nand to say that he is exercising his right of locomotion. He has a right\r\nof discussion, no doubt, as he has a right of property and a right of\r\nlocomotion. But he must use all his rights so as not to infringe the\r\nrights of others.\r\n\r\nThese, Sir, are the principles on which I would frame the law of\r\nblasphemy; and if the law were so framed, I am at a loss to understand\r\nwhy a Jew might not enforce it as well as a Christian. I am not a Roman\r\nCatholic; but if I were a judge at Malta, I should have no scruple about\r\npunishing a bigoted Protestant who should burn the Pope in effigy before\r\nthe eyes of thousands of Roman Catholics. I am not a Mussulman; but if\r\nI were a judge in India, I should have no scruple about punishing a\r\nChristian who should pollute a mosque. Why, then, should I doubt that\r\na Jew, raised by his ability, learning, and integrity to the judicial\r\nbench, would deal properly with any person who, in a Christian country,\r\nshould insult the Christian religion?\r\n\r\nBut, says my honourable friend, it has been prophesied that the Jews are\r\nto be wanderers on the face of the earth, and that they are not to mix\r\non terms of equality with the people of the countries in which they\r\nsojourn. Now, Sir, I am confident that I can demonstrate that this is\r\nnot the sense of any prophecy which is part of Holy Writ. For it is an\r\nundoubted fact that, in the United States of America, Jewish citizens do\r\npossess all the privileges possessed by Christian citizens. Therefore,\r\nif the prophecies mean that the Jews never shall, during their\r\nwanderings, be admitted by other nations to equal participation of\r\npolitical rights, the prophecies are false. But the prophecies are\r\ncertainly not false. Therefore their meaning cannot be that which is\r\nattributed to them by my honourable friend.\r\n\r\nAnother objection which has been made to this motion is that the Jews\r\nlook forward to the coming of a great deliverer, to their return to\r\nPalestine, to the rebuilding of their Temple, to the revival of their\r\nancient worship, and that therefore they will always consider England,\r\nnot their country, but merely as their place of exile. But, surely, Sir,\r\nit would be the grossest ignorance of human nature to imagine that the\r\nanticipation of an event which is to happen at some time altogether\r\nindefinite, of an event which has been vainly expected during many\r\ncenturies, of an event which even those who confidently expect that it\r\nwill happen do not confidently expect that they or their children or\r\ntheir grandchildren will see, can ever occupy the minds of men to such\r\na degree as to make them regardless of what is near and present and\r\ncertain. Indeed Christians, as well as Jews, believe that the existing\r\norder of things will come to an end. Many Christians believe that Jesus\r\nwill visibly reign on earth during a thousand years. Expositors of\r\nprophecy have gone so far as to fix the year when the Millennial period\r\nis to commence. The prevailing opinion is, I think, in favour of the\r\nyear 1866; but, according to some commentators, the time is close at\r\nhand. Are we to exclude all millennarians from Parliament and office, on\r\nthe ground that they are impatiently looking forward to the miraculous\r\nmonarchy which is to supersede the present dynasty and the present\r\nconstitution of England, and that therefore they cannot be heartily\r\nloyal to King William?\r\n\r\nIn one important point, Sir, my honourable friend, the Member for the\r\nUniversity of Oxford, must acknowledge that the Jewish religion is\r\nof all erroneous religions the least mischievous. There is not the\r\nslightest chance that the Jewish religion will spread. The Jew does not\r\nwish to make proselytes. He may be said to reject them. He thinks it\r\nalmost culpable in one who does not belong to his race to presume to\r\nbelong to his religion. It is therefore not strange that a conversion\r\nfrom Christianity to Judaism should be a rarer occurrence than a total\r\neclipse of the sun. There was one distinguished convert in the last\r\ncentury, Lord George Gordon; and the history of his conversion\r\ndeserves to be remembered. For if ever there was a proselyte of whom a\r\nproselytising sect would have been proud, it was Lord George; not only\r\nbecause he was a man of high birth and rank; not only because he\r\nhad been a member of the legislature; but also because he had been\r\ndistinguished by the intolerance, nay, the ferocity, of his zeal for his\r\nown form of Christianity. But was he allured into the Synagogue? Was he\r\neven welcomed to it? No, sir; he was coldly and reluctantly permitted\r\nto share the reproach and suffering of the chosen people; but he was\r\nsternly shut out from their privileges. He underwent the painful rite\r\nwhich their law enjoins. But when, on his deathbed, he begged hard to\r\nbe buried among them according to their ceremonial, he was told that\r\nhis request could not be granted. I understand that cry of \"Hear.\" It\r\nreminds me that one of the arguments against this motion is that the\r\nJews are an unsocial people, that they draw close to each other, and\r\nstand aloof from strangers. Really, Sir, it is amusing to compare\r\nthe manner in which the question of Catholic emancipation was argued\r\nformerly by some gentlemen with the manner in which the question of Jew\r\nemancipation is argued by the same gentlemen now. When the question\r\nwas about Catholic emancipation, the cry was, \"See how restless, how\r\nversatile, how encroaching, how insinuating, is the spirit of the\r\nChurch of Rome. See how her priests compass earth and sea to make one\r\nproselyte, how indefatigably they toil, how attentively they study the\r\nweak and strong parts of every character, how skilfully they employ\r\nliterature, arts, sciences, as engines for the propagation of their\r\nfaith. You find them in every region and under every disguise, collating\r\nmanuscripts in the Bodleian, fixing telescopes in the observatory of\r\nPekin, teaching the use of the plough and the spinning-wheel to the\r\nsavages of Paraguay. Will you give power to the members of a Church so\r\nbusy, so aggressive, so insatiable?\" Well, now the question is about\r\npeople who never try to seduce any stranger to join them, and who do not\r\nwish anybody to be of their faith who is not also of their blood. And\r\nnow you exclaim, \"Will you give power to the members of a sect which\r\nremains sullenly apart from other sects, which does not invite, nay,\r\nwhich hardly ever admits neophytes?\" The truth is, that bigotry will\r\nnever want a pretence. Whatever the sect be which it is proposed\r\nto tolerate, the peculiarities of that sect will, for the time, be\r\npronounced by intolerant men to be the most odious and dangerous that\r\ncan be conceived. As to the Jews, that they are unsocial as respects\r\nreligion is true; and so much the better: for, surely, as Christians,\r\nwe cannot wish that they should bestir themselves to pervert us from\r\nour own faith. But that the Jews would be unsocial members of the civil\r\ncommunity, if the civil community did its duty by them, has never been\r\nproved. My right honourable friend who made the motion which we are\r\ndiscussing has produced a great body of evidence to show that they have\r\nbeen grossly misrepresented; and that evidence has not been refuted by\r\nmy honourable friend the Member for the University of Oxford. But what\r\nif it were true that the Jews are unsocial? What if it were true that\r\nthey do not regard England as their country? Would not the treatment\r\nwhich they have undergone explain and excuse their antipathy to the\r\nsociety in which they live? Has not similar antipathy often been felt\r\nby persecuted Christians to the society which persecuted them? While\r\nthe bloody code of Elizabeth was enforced against the English Roman\r\nCatholics, what was the patriotism of Roman Catholics? Oliver Cromwell\r\nsaid that in his time they were Espaniolised. At a later period it\r\nmight have been said that they were Gallicised. It was the same with the\r\nCalvinists. What more deadly enemies had France in the days of Louis\r\nthe Fourteenth than the persecuted Huguenots? But would any rational man\r\ninfer from these facts that either the Roman Catholic as such, or the\r\nCalvinist as such, is incapable of loving the land of his birth? If\r\nEngland were now invaded by Roman Catholics, how many English Roman\r\nCatholics would go over to the invader? If France were now attacked by\r\na Protestant enemy, how many French Protestants would lend him help?\r\nWhy not try what effect would be produced on the Jews by that tolerant\r\npolicy which has made the English Roman Catholic a good Englishman, and\r\nthe French Calvinist a good Frenchman?\r\n\r\nAnother charge has been brought against the Jews, not by my honourable\r\nfriend the Member for the University of Oxford--he has too much learning\r\nand too much good feeling to make such a charge--but by the honourable\r\nMember for Oldham, who has, I am sorry to see, quitted his place. The\r\nhonourable Member for Oldham tells us that the Jews are naturally a mean\r\nrace, a sordid race, a money-getting race; that they are averse to all\r\nhonourable callings; that they neither sow nor reap; that they have\r\nneither flocks nor herds; that usury is the only pursuit for which they\r\nare fit; that they are destitute of all elevated and amiable sentiments.\r\nSuch, Sir, has in every age been the reasoning of bigots. They\r\nnever fail to plead in justification of persecution the vices which\r\npersecution has engendered. England has been to the Jews less than half\r\na country; and we revile them because they do not feel for England more\r\nthan a half patriotism. We treat them as slaves, and wonder that they do\r\nnot regard us as brethren. We drive them to mean occupations, and then\r\nreproach them for not embracing honourable professions. We long\r\nforbade them to possess land; and we complain that they chiefly occupy\r\nthemselves in trade. We shut them out from all the paths of ambition;\r\nand then we despise them for taking refuge in avarice. During many ages\r\nwe have, in all our dealings with them, abused our immense superiority\r\nof force; and then we are disgusted because they have recourse to that\r\ncunning which is the natural and universal defence of the weak against\r\nthe violence of the strong. But were they always a mere money-changing,\r\nmoney-getting, money-hoarding race? Nobody knows better than my\r\nhonourable friend the Member for the University of Oxford that there is\r\nnothing in their national character which unfits them for the highest\r\nduties of citizens. He knows that, in the infancy of civilisation, when\r\nour island was as savage as New Guinea, when letters and arts were\r\nstill unknown to Athens, when scarcely a thatched hut stood on what\r\nwas afterwards the site of Rome, this contemned people had their\r\nfenced cities and cedar palaces, their splendid Temple, their fleets of\r\nmerchant ships, their schools of sacred learning, their great statesmen\r\nand soldiers, their natural philosophers, their historians and their\r\npoets. What nation ever contended more manfully against overwhelming\r\nodds for its independence and religion? What nation ever, in its last\r\nagonies, gave such signal proofs of what may be accomplished by a\r\nbrave despair? And if, in the course of many centuries, the oppressed\r\ndescendants of warriors and sages have degenerated from the qualities of\r\ntheir fathers, if, while excluded from the blessings of law, and bowed\r\ndown under the yoke of slavery, they have contracted some of the vices\r\nof outlaws and of slaves, shall we consider this as matter of reproach\r\nto them? Shall we not rather consider it as matter of shame and remorse\r\nto ourselves? Let us do justice to them. Let us open to them the door of\r\nthe House of Commons. Let us open to them every career in which ability\r\nand energy can be displayed. Till we have done this, let us not presume\r\nto say that there is no genius among the countrymen of Isaiah, no\r\nheroism among the descendants of the Maccabees.\r\n\r\nSir, in supporting the motion of my honourable friend, I am, I firmly\r\nbelieve, supporting the honour and the interests of the Christian\r\nreligion. I should think that I insulted that religion if I said that\r\nit cannot stand unaided by intolerant laws. Without such laws it was\r\nestablished, and without such laws it may be maintained. It triumphed\r\nover the superstitions of the most refined and of the most savage\r\nnations, over the graceful mythology of Greece and the bloody idolatry\r\nof the Northern forests. It prevailed over the power and policy of\r\nthe Roman empire. It tamed the barbarians by whom that empire was\r\noverthrown. But all these victories were gained not by the help of\r\nintolerance, but in spite of the opposition of intolerance. The whole\r\nhistory of Christianity proves that she has little indeed to fear from\r\npersecution as a foe, but much to fear from persecution as an ally. May\r\nshe long continue to bless our country with her benignant influence,\r\nstrong in her sublime philosophy, strong in her spotless morality,\r\nstrong in those internal and external evidences to which the most\r\npowerful and comprehensive of human intellects have yielded assent,\r\nthe last solace of those who have outlived every earthly hope, the last\r\nrestraint of those who are raised above every earthly fear! But let not\r\nus, mistaking her character and her interests, fight the battle of truth\r\nwith the weapons of error, and endeavour to support by oppression that\r\nreligion which first taught the human race the great lesson of universal\r\ncharity.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT OF INDIA. (JULY 10, 1833) A SPEECH DELIVERED IN THE HOUSE OF\r\nCOMMONS ON THE 10TH OF JULY 1833.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the tenth of July 1833, Mr Charles Grant, President of the\r\nBoard of Control, moved that the Bill for effecting an arrangement with\r\nthe India Company, and for the better government of His Majesty's\r\nIndian territories, should be read a second time. The motion was carried\r\nwithout a division, but not without a long debate, in the course of\r\nwhich the following Speech was made.\r\n\r\nHaving, while this bill was in preparation, enjoyed the fullest and\r\nkindest confidence of my right honourable friend, the President of the\r\nBoard of Control, agreeing with him completely in all those views which\r\non a former occasion he so luminously and eloquently developed, having\r\nshared his anxieties, and feeling that in some degree I share his\r\nresponsibility, I am naturally desirous to obtain the attention of\r\nthe House while I attempt to defend the principles of the proposed\r\narrangement. I wish that I could promise to be very brief; but the\r\nsubject is so extensive that I will only promise to condense what I have\r\nto say as much as I can.\r\n\r\nI rejoice, Sir, that I am completely dispensed, by the turn which our\r\ndebates have taken, from the necessity of saying anything in favour\r\nof one part of our plan, the opening of the China trade. No voice, I\r\nbelieve, has yet been raised here in support of the monopoly. On that\r\nsubject all public men of all parties seem to be agreed. The resolution\r\nproposed by the Ministers has received the unanimous assent of both\r\nHouses, and the approbation of the whole kingdom. I will not, therefore,\r\nSir, detain you by vindicating what no gentleman has yet ventured to\r\nattack, but will proceed to call your attention to those effects which\r\nthis great commercial revolution necessarily produced on the system of\r\nIndian government and finance.\r\n\r\nThe China trade is to be opened. Reason requires this. Public opinion\r\nrequires it. The Government of the Duke of Wellington felt the necessity\r\nas strongly as the Government of Lord Grey. No Minister, Whig or\r\nTory, could have been found to propose a renewal of the monopoly.\r\nNo parliament, reformed or unreformed, would have listened to such a\r\nproposition. But though the opening of the trade was a matter concerning\r\nwhich the public had long made up its mind, the political consequences\r\nwhich must necessarily follow from the opening of the trade seem to me\r\nto be even now little understood. The language which I have heard in\r\nalmost every circle where the subject was discussed was this: \"Take away\r\nthe monopoly, and leave the government of India to the Company:\" a\r\nvery short and convenient way of settling one of the most complicated\r\nquestions that ever a legislature had to consider. The honourable\r\nMember for Sheffield (Mr Buckingham.), though not disposed to retain the\r\nCompany as an organ of government, has repeatedly used language which\r\nproves that he shares in the general misconception. The fact is that\r\nthe abolition of the monopoly rendered it absolutely necessary to make a\r\nfundamental change in the constitution of that great Corporation.\r\n\r\nThe Company had united in itself two characters, the character of trader\r\nand the character of sovereign. Between the trader and the sovereign\r\nthere was a long and complicated account, almost every item of which\r\nfurnished matter for litigation. While the monopoly continued, indeed,\r\nlitigation was averted. The effect of the monopoly was, to satisfy the\r\nclaims both of commerce and of territory, at the expense of a third\r\nparty, the English people: to secure at once funds for the dividend of\r\nthe stockholder and funds for the government of the Indian Empire, by\r\nmeans of a heavy tax on the tea consumed in this country. But, when the\r\nthird party would no longer bear this charge, all the great financial\r\nquestions which had, at the cost of that third party, been kept in\r\nabeyance, were opened in an instant. The connection between the Company\r\nin its mercantile capacity, and the same Company in its political\r\ncapacity, was dissolved. Even if the Company were permitted, as has been\r\nsuggested, to govern India, and at the same time to trade with China,\r\nno advances would be made from the profits of its Chinese trade for\r\nthe support of its Indian government. It was in consideration of the\r\nexclusive privilege that the Company had hitherto been required to make\r\nthose advances; it was by the exclusive privilege that the Company had\r\nbeen enabled to make them. When that privilege was taken away, it would\r\nbe unreasonable in the legislature to impose such an obligation, and\r\nimpossible for the Company to fulfil it. The whole system of loans from\r\ncommerce to territory, and repayments from territory to commerce, must\r\ncease. Each party must rest altogether on its own resources. It was\r\ntherefore absolutely necessary to ascertain what resources each party\r\npossessed, to bring the long and intricate account between them to a\r\nclose, and to assign to each a fair portion of assets and liabilities.\r\nThere was vast property. How much of that property was applicable to\r\npurposes of state? How much was applicable to a dividend? There were\r\ndebts to the amount of many millions. Which of these were the debts of\r\nthe government that ruled at Calcutta? Which of the great mercantile\r\nhouse that bought tea at Canton? Were the creditors to look to the\r\nland revenues of India for their money? Or, were they entitled to put\r\nexecutions into the warehouses behind Bishopsgate Street?\r\n\r\nThere were two ways of settling these questions--adjudication and\r\ncompromise. The difficulties of adjudication were great; I think\r\ninsuperable. Whatever acuteness and diligence could do has been done.\r\nOne person in particular, whose talents and industry peculiarly fitted\r\nhim for such investigations, and of whom I can never think without\r\nregret, Mr Hyde Villiers, devoted himself to the examination with an\r\nardour and a perseverance, which, I believe, shortened a life most\r\nvaluable to his country and to his friends. The assistance of the most\r\nskilful accountants has been called in. But the difficulties are such as\r\nno accountant, however skilful, could possibly remove. The difficulties\r\nare not arithmetical, but political. They arise from the constitution\r\nof the Company, from the long and intimate union of the commercial and\r\nimperial characters in one body. Suppose that the treasurer of a charity\r\nwere to mix up the money which he receives on account of the charity\r\nwith his own private rents and dividends, to pay the whole into his bank\r\nto his own private account, to draw it out again by cheques in exactly\r\nthe same form when he wanted it for his private expenses, and when he\r\nwanted it for the purposes of his public trust. Suppose that he were\r\nto continue to act thus till he was himself ignorant whether he were\r\nin advance or in arrear; and suppose that many years after his death a\r\nquestion were to arise whether his estate were in debt to the charity\r\nor the charity in debt to his estate. Such is the question which is\r\nnow before us, with this important difference; that the accounts of an\r\nindividual could not be in such a state unless he had been guilty of\r\nfraud, or of that gross negligence which is scarcely less culpable than\r\nfraud, and that the accounts of the Company were brought into this state\r\nby circumstances of a very peculiar kind, by circumstances unparalleled\r\nin the history of the world.\r\n\r\nIt is a mistake to suppose that the Company was a merely commercial body\r\ntill the middle of the last century. Commerce was its chief object; but\r\nin order to enable it to pursue that object, it had been, like the other\r\nCompanies which were its rivals, like the Dutch India Company, like the\r\nFrench India Company, invested from a very early period with political\r\nfunctions. More than a hundred and twenty years ago, the Company was\r\nin miniature precisely what it now is. It was intrusted with the very\r\nhighest prerogatives of sovereignty. It had its forts, and its white\r\ncaptains, and its black sepoys; it had its civil and criminal tribunals;\r\nit was authorised to proclaim martial law; it sent ambassadors to the\r\nnative governments, and concluded treaties with them; it was Zemindar of\r\nseveral districts, and within those districts, like other Zemindars of\r\nthe first class, it exercised the powers of a sovereign, even to the\r\ninfliction of capital punishment on the Hindoos within its jurisdiction.\r\nIt is incorrect, therefore, to say, that the Company was at first a mere\r\ntrader, and has since become a sovereign. It was at first a great trader\r\nand a petty prince. The political functions at first attracted little\r\nnotice, because they were merely auxiliary to the commercial functions.\r\nBy degrees, however, the political functions became more and more\r\nimportant. The Zemindar became a great nabob, became sovereign of all\r\nIndia; the two hundred sepoys became two hundred thousand. This change\r\nwas gradually wrought, and was not immediately comprehended. It was\r\nnatural that, while the political functions of the Company were merely\r\nauxiliary to its commerce, the political accounts should have been mixed\r\nup with the commercial accounts. It was equally natural that this mode\r\nof keeping accounts, having once been established, should have remained\r\nunaltered; and the more so, as the change in the situation of the\r\nCompany, though rapid, was not sudden. It is impossible to name any one\r\nday, or any one year, as the day or the year when the Company became a\r\ngreat potentate. It has been the fashion indeed to fix on the year 1765,\r\nthe year in which the Mogul issued a commission authorising the Company\r\nto administer the revenues of Bengal, Bahar, and Orissa, as the precise\r\ndate of the accession of this singular body to sovereignty. I am utterly\r\nat a loss to understand why this epoch should be selected. Long before\r\n1765 the Company had the reality of political power. Long before that\r\nyear, they made a Nabob of Arcot; they made and unmade Nabobs of Bengal;\r\nthey humbled the Vizier of Oude; they braved the Emperor of Hindostan\r\nhimself; more than half the revenues of Bengal were, under one pretence\r\nor another, administered by them. And after the grant, the Company was\r\nnot, in form and name, an independent power. It was merely a minister\r\nof the Court of Delhi. Its coinage bore the name of Shah Alam. The\r\ninscription which, down to the time of the Marquess of Hastings,\r\nappeared on the seal of the Governor-General, declared that great\r\nfunctionary to be the slave of the Mogul. Even to this day we have never\r\nformally deposed the King of Delhi. The Company contents itself with\r\nbeing Mayor of the Palace, while the Roi Faineant is suffered to play at\r\nbeing a sovereign. In fact, it was considered, both by Lord Clive and\r\nby Warren Hastings, as a point of policy to leave the character of\r\nthe Company thus undefined, in order that the English might treat the\r\nprinces in whose names they governed as realities or nonentities, just\r\nas might be most convenient.\r\n\r\nThus the transformation of the Company from a trading body, which\r\npossessed some sovereign prerogatives for the purposes of trade, into a\r\nsovereign body, the trade of which was auxiliary to its sovereignty, was\r\neffected by degrees and under disguise. It is not strange, therefore,\r\nthat the mercantile and political transactions of this great corporation\r\nshould be entangled together in inextricable complication. The\r\ncommercial investments have been purchased out of the revenues of the\r\nempire. The expenses of war and government have been defrayed out of\r\nthe profits of the trade. Commerce and territory have contributed to\r\nthe improvement of the same spot of land, to the repairs of the same\r\nbuilding. Securities have been given in precisely the same form for\r\nmoney which has been borrowed for purposes of State, and for money which\r\nhas been borrowed for purposes of traffic. It is easy, indeed,--and this\r\nis a circumstance which has, I think, misled some gentlemen,--it is easy\r\nto see what part of the assets of the Company appears in a commercial\r\nform, and what part appears in a political or territorial form. But\r\nthis is not the question. Assets which are commercial in form may\r\nbe territorial as respects the right of property; assets which are\r\nterritorial in form may be commercial as respects the right of property.\r\nA chest of tea is not necessarily commercial property; it may have\r\nbeen bought out of the territorial revenue. A fort is not necessarily\r\nterritorial property; it may stand on ground which the Company bought a\r\nhundred years ago out of their commercial profits. Adjudication, if by\r\nadjudication be meant decision according to some known rule of law, was\r\nout of the question. To leave matters like these to be determined by the\r\nordinary maxims of our civil jurisprudence would have been the height of\r\nabsurdity and injustice. For example, the home bond debt of the Company,\r\nit is believed, was incurred partly for political and partly for\r\ncommercial purposes. But there is no evidence which would enable us to\r\nassign to each branch its proper share. The bonds all run in the same\r\nform; and a court of justice would, therefore, of course, either lay the\r\nwhole burthen on the proprietors, or lay the whole on the territory.\r\nWe have legal opinions, very respectable legal opinions, to the effect,\r\nthat in strictness of law the territory is not responsible, and that the\r\ncommercial assets are responsible for every farthing of the debts which\r\nwere incurred for the government and defence of India. But though this\r\nmay be, and I believe is, law, it is, I am sure, neither reason nor\r\njustice. On the other hand, it is urged by the advocates of the Company,\r\nthat some valuable portions of the territory are the property of that\r\nbody in its commercial capacity; that Calcutta, for example, is the\r\nprivate estate of the Company; that the Company holds the island of\r\nBombay, in free and common socage, as of the Manor of East Greenwich. I\r\nwill not pronounce any opinion on these points. I have considered them\r\nenough to see that there is quite difficulty enough in them to exercise\r\nall the ingenuity of all the lawyers in the kingdom for twenty\r\nyears. But the fact is, Sir, that the municipal law was not made for\r\ncontroversies of this description. The existence of such a body as this\r\ngigantic corporation, this political monster of two natures, subject in\r\none hemisphere, sovereign in another, had never been contemplated by the\r\nlegislators or judges of former ages. Nothing but grotesque absurdity\r\nand atrocious injustice could have been the effect, if the claims and\r\nliabilities of such a body had been settled according to the rules of\r\nWestminster Hall, if the maxims of conveyancers had been applied to the\r\ntitles by which flourishing cities and provinces are held, or the maxims\r\nof the law merchant to those promissory notes which are the securities\r\nfor a great National Debt, raised for the purpose of exterminating the\r\nPindarrees and humbling the Burmese.\r\n\r\nIt was, as I have said, absolutely impossible to bring the question\r\nbetween commerce and territory to a satisfactory adjudication; and I\r\nmust add that, even if the difficulties which I have mentioned could\r\nhave been surmounted, even if there had been reason to hope that a\r\nsatisfactory adjudication could have been obtained, I should still\r\nhave wished to avoid that course. I think it desirable that the Company\r\nshould continue to have a share in the government of India; and it would\r\nevidently have been impossible, pending a litigation between commerce\r\nand territory, to leave any political power to the Company. It\r\nwould clearly have been the duty of those who were charged with the\r\nsuperintendence of India, to be the patrons of India throughout that\r\nmomentous litigation, to scrutinise with the utmost severity every claim\r\nwhich might be made on the Indian revenues, and to oppose, with energy\r\nand perseverance, every such claim, unless its justice were manifest.\r\nIf the Company was to be engaged in a suit for many millions, in a suit\r\nwhich might last for many years, against the Indian territory, could we\r\nentrust the Company with the government of that territory? Could we put\r\nthe plaintiff in the situation of prochain ami of the defendant? Could\r\nwe appoint governors who would have an interest opposed in the most\r\ndirect manner to the interest of the governed, whose stock would have\r\nbeen raised in value by every decision which added to the burthens of\r\ntheir subjects, and depressed by every decision which diminished those\r\nburthens? It would be absurd to suppose that they would efficiently\r\ndefend our Indian Empire against the claims which they were themselves\r\nbringing against it; and it would be equally absurd to give the\r\ngovernment of the Indian Empire to those who could not be trusted to\r\ndefend its interests.\r\n\r\nSeeing, then, that it was most difficult, if not wholly impossible, to\r\nresort to adjudication between commerce and territory, seeing that,\r\nif recourse were had to adjudication, it would be necessary to make a\r\ncomplete revolution in the whole constitution of India, the Government\r\nhas proposed a compromise. That compromise, with some modifications\r\nwhich did not in the slightest degree affect its principle, and which,\r\nwhile they gave satisfaction to the Company, will eventually lay no\r\nadditional burthen on the territory, has been accepted. It has, like\r\nall other compromises, been loudly censured by violent partisans on\r\nboth sides. It has been represented by some as far too favourable to the\r\nCompany, and by others as most unjust to the Company. Sir, I own that we\r\ncannot prove that either of these accusations is unfounded. It is of the\r\nvery essence of our case that we should not be able to show that we have\r\nassigned, either to commerce or to territory, its precise due. For our\r\nprincipal reason for recommending a compromise was our full conviction\r\nthat it was absolutely impossible to ascertain with precision what was\r\ndue to commerce and what was due to territory. It is not strange that\r\nsome people should accuse us of robbing the Company, and others of\r\nconferring a vast boon on the Company, at the expense of India: for\r\nwe have proposed a middle course, on the very ground that there was\r\na chance of a result much more favourable to the Company than our\r\narrangement, and a chance also of a result much less favourable. If the\r\nquestions pending between the Company and India had been decided as the\r\nardent supporters of the Company predicted, India would, if I calculate\r\nrightly, have paid eleven millions more than she will now have to pay.\r\nIf those questions had been decided as some violent enemies of the\r\nCompany predicted, that great body would have been utterly ruined. The\r\nvery meaning of compromise is that each party gives up his chance of\r\ncomplete success, in order to be secured against the chance of utter\r\nfailure. And, as men of sanguine minds always overrate the chances in\r\ntheir own favour, every fair compromise is sure to be severely censured\r\non both sides. I conceive that, in a case so dark and complicated as\r\nthis, the compromise which we recommend is sufficiently vindicated, if\r\nit cannot be proved to be unfair. We are not bound to prove it to be\r\nfair. For it would have been unnecessary for us to resort to compromise\r\nat all if we had been in possession of evidence which would have enabled\r\nus to pronounce, with certainty, what claims were fair and what were\r\nunfair. It seems to me that we have acted with due consideration for\r\nevery party. The dividend which we give to the proprietors is precisely\r\nthe same dividend which they have been receiving during forty years,\r\nand which they have expected to receive permanently. The price of their\r\nstock bears at present the same proportion to the price of other stock\r\nwhich it bore four or five years ago, before the anxiety and excitement\r\nwhich the late negotiations naturally produced had begun to operate.\r\nAs to the territory, on the other hand, it is true that, if the assets\r\nwhich are now in a commercial form should not produce a fund sufficient\r\nto pay the debts and dividend of the Company, the territory must stand\r\nto the loss and pay the difference. But in return for taking this risk,\r\nthe territory obtains an immediate release from claims to the amount of\r\nmany millions. I certainly do not believe that all those claims\r\ncould have been substantiated; but I know that very able men think\r\ndifferently. And, if only one-fourth of the sum demanded had been\r\nawarded to the Company, India would have lost more than the largest\r\nsum which, as it seems to me, she can possibly lose under the proposed\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nIn a pecuniary point of view, therefore, I conceive that we can defend\r\nthe measure as it affects the territory. But to the territory the\r\npecuniary question is of secondary importance. If we have made a good\r\npecuniary bargain for India, but a bad political bargain, if we have\r\nsaved three or four millions to the finances of that country, and given\r\nto it, at the same time, pernicious institutions, we shall indeed have\r\nbeen practising a most ruinous parsimony. If, on the other hand, it\r\nshall be found that we have added fifty or a hundred thousand pounds\r\na-year to the expenditure of an empire which yields a revenue of twenty\r\nmillions, but that we have at the same time secured to that empire, as\r\nfar as in us lies, the blessings of good government, we shall have no\r\nreason to be ashamed of our profusion. I hope and believe that India\r\nwill have to pay nothing. But on the most unfavourable supposition that\r\ncan be made, she will not have to pay so much to the Company as she now\r\npays annually to a single state pageant, to the titular Nabob of Bengal,\r\nfor example, or the titular King of Delhi. What she pays to these\r\nnominal princes, who, while they did anything, did mischief, and who\r\nnow do nothing, she may well consent to pay to her real rulers, if\r\nshe receives from them, in return, efficient protection and good\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nWe come then to the great question. Is it desirable to retain the\r\nCompany as an organ of government for India? I think that it is\r\ndesirable. The question is, I acknowledge, beset with difficulties. We\r\nhave to solve one of the hardest problems in politics. We are trying to\r\nmake brick without straw, to bring a clean thing out of an unclean,\r\nto give a good government to a people to whom we cannot give a free\r\ngovernment. In this country, in any neighbouring country, it is easy to\r\nframe securities against oppression. In Europe, you have the materials\r\nof good government everywhere ready to your hands. The people are\r\neverywhere perfectly competent to hold some share, not in every country\r\nan equal share, but some share of political power. If the question were,\r\nWhat is the best mode of securing good government in Europe? the merest\r\nsmatterer in politics would answer, representative institutions.\r\nIn India you cannot have representative institutions. Of all the\r\ninnumerable speculators who have offered their suggestions on Indian\r\npolitics, not a single one, as far as I know, however democratical his\r\nopinions may be, has ever maintained the possibility of giving, at the\r\npresent time, such institutions to India. One gentleman, extremely\r\nwell acquainted with the affairs of our Eastern Empire, a most valuable\r\nservant of the Company, and the author of a History of India, which,\r\nthough certainly not free from faults, is, I think, on the whole, the\r\ngreatest historical work which has appeared in our language since that\r\nof Gibbon, I mean Mr Mill, was examined on this point. That gentleman\r\nis well known to be a very bold and uncompromising politician. He has\r\nwritten strongly, far too strongly I think, in favour of pure democracy.\r\nHe has gone so far as to maintain that no nation which has not a\r\nrepresentative legislature, chosen by universal suffrage, enjoys\r\nsecurity against oppression. But when he was asked before the Committee\r\nof last year, whether he thought representative government practicable\r\nin India, his answer was, \"utterly out of the question.\" This, then,\r\nis the state in which we are. We have to frame a good government for\r\na country into which, by universal acknowledgment, we cannot introduce\r\nthose institutions which all our habits, which all the reasonings of\r\nEuropean philosophers, which all the history of our own part of the\r\nworld would lead us to consider as the one great security for good\r\ngovernment. We have to engraft on despotism those blessings which are\r\nthe natural fruits of liberty. In these circumstances, Sir, it behoves\r\nus to be cautious, even to the verge of timidity. The light of political\r\nscience and of history are withdrawn: we are walking in darkness: we do\r\nnot distinctly see whither we are going. It is the wisdom of a man, so\r\nsituated, to feel his way, and not to plant his foot till he is well\r\nassured that the ground before him is firm.\r\n\r\nSome things, however, in the midst of this obscurity, I can see with\r\nclearness. I can see, for example, that it is desirable that the\r\nauthority exercised in this country over the Indian government should be\r\ndivided between two bodies, between a minister or a board appointed by\r\nthe Crown, and some other body independent of the Crown. If India is\r\nto be a dependency of England, to be at war with our enemies, to be at\r\npeace with our allies, to be protected by the English navy from maritime\r\naggression, to have a portion of the English army mixed with its sepoys,\r\nit plainly follows that the King, to whom the Constitution gives the\r\ndirection of foreign affairs, and the command of the military and naval\r\nforces, ought to have a share in the direction of the Indian government.\r\nYet, on the other hand, that a revenue of twenty millions a year,\r\nan army of two hundred thousand men, a civil service abounding with\r\nlucrative situations, should be left to the disposal of the Crown\r\nwithout any check whatever, is what no minister, I conceive, would\r\nventure to propose. This House is indeed the check provided by the\r\nConstitution on the abuse of the royal prerogative. But that this House\r\nis, or is likely ever to be, an efficient check on abuses practised\r\nin India, I altogether deny. We have, as I believe we all feel, quite\r\nbusiness enough. If we were to undertake the task of looking into Indian\r\naffairs as we look into British affairs, if we were to have Indian\r\nbudgets and Indian estimates, if we were to go into the Indian currency\r\nquestion and the Indian Bank Charter, if to our disputes about Belgium\r\nand Holland, Don Pedro and Don Miguel, were to be added disputes about\r\nthe debts of the Guicowar and the disorders of Mysore, the ex-king of\r\nthe Afghans and the Maharajah Runjeet Sing; if we were to have one night\r\noccupied by the embezzlements of the Benares mint, and another by the\r\npanic in the Calcutta money market; if the questions of Suttee or no\r\nSuttee, Pilgrim tax or no Pilgrim tax, Ryotwary or Zemindary, half Batta\r\nor whole Batta, were to be debated at the same length at which we have\r\ndebated Church reform and the assessed taxes, twenty-four hours a day\r\nand three hundred and sixty-five days a year would be too short a time\r\nfor the discharge of our duties. The House, it is plain, has not\r\nthe necessary time to settle these matters; nor has it the necessary\r\nknowledge; nor has it the motives to acquire that knowledge. The late\r\nchange in its constitution has made it, I believe, a much more faithful\r\nrepresentative of the English people. But it is as far as ever from\r\nbeing a representative of the Indian people. A broken head in Cold Bath\r\nFields produces a greater sensation among us than three pitched battles\r\nin India. A few weeks ago we had to decide on a claim brought by an\r\nindividual against the revenues of India. If it had been an English\r\nquestion the walls would scarcely have held the Members who would\r\nhave flocked to the division. It was an Indian question; and we could\r\nscarcely, by dint of supplication, make a House. Even when my right\r\nhonourable friend, the President of the Board of Control, gave his able\r\nand interesting explanation of the plan which he intended to propose for\r\nthe government of a hundred millions of human beings, the attendance was\r\nnot so large as I have often seen it on a turnpike bill or a railroad\r\nbill.\r\n\r\nI then take these things as proved, that the Crown must have a certain\r\nauthority over India, that there must be an efficient check on the\r\nauthority of the Crown, and that the House of Commons cannot be that\r\nefficient check. We must then find some other body to perform that\r\nimportant office. We have such a body, the Company. Shall we discard it?\r\n\r\nIt is true that the power of the Company is an anomaly in politics.\r\nIt is strange, very strange, that a joint-stock society of traders,\r\na society, the shares of which are daily passed from hand to hand,\r\na society, the component parts of which are perpetually changing, a\r\nsociety, which, judging a priori from its constitution, we should\r\nhave said was as little fitted for imperial functions as the Merchant\r\nTailors' Company or the New River Company, should be intrusted with\r\nthe sovereignty of a larger population, the disposal of a larger\r\nclear revenue, the command of a larger army, than are under the direct\r\nmanagement of the Executive Government of the United Kingdom. But\r\nwhat constitution can we give to our Indian Empire which shall not\r\nbe strange, which shall not be anomalous? That Empire is itself the\r\nstrangest of all political anomalies. That a handful of adventurers from\r\nan island in the Atlantic should have subjugated a vast country divided\r\nfrom the place of their birth by half the globe; a country which at no\r\nvery distant period was merely the subject of fable to the nations of\r\nEurope; a country never before violated by the most renowned of Western\r\nconquerors; a country which Trajan never entered; a country lying beyond\r\nthe point where the phalanx of Alexander refused to proceed; that we\r\nshould govern a territory ten thousand miles from us, a territory larger\r\nand more populous than France, Spain, Italy, and Germany put together, a\r\nterritory, the present clear revenue of which exceeds the present\r\nclear revenue of any state in the world, France excepted; a territory\r\ninhabited by men differing from us in race, colour, language, manners,\r\nmorals, religion; these are prodigies to which the world has seen\r\nnothing similar. Reason is confounded. We interrogate the past in vain.\r\nGeneral rules are useless where the whole is one vast exception. The\r\nCompany is an anomaly; but it is part of a system where every thing is\r\nanomaly. It is the strangest of all governments; but it is designed for\r\nthe strangest of all empires.\r\n\r\nIf we discard the Company, we must find a substitute: and, take what\r\nsubstitute we may, we shall find ourselves unable to give any reason for\r\nbelieving that the body which we have put in the room of the Company\r\nis likely to acquit itself of its duties better than the Company.\r\nCommissioners appointed by the King during pleasure would be no check on\r\nthe Crown; Commissioners appointed by the King or by Parliament for\r\nlife would always be appointed by the political party which might be\r\nuppermost, and if a change of administration took place, would harass\r\nthe new Government with the most vexatious opposition. The plan\r\nsuggested by the right honourable Gentleman, the Member for\r\nMontgomeryshire (Mr Charles Wynn.), is I think the very worst that I\r\nhave ever heard. He would have Directors nominated every four years\r\nby the Crown. Is it not plain that these Directors would always be\r\nappointed from among the supporters of the Ministry for the time being;\r\nthat their situations would depend on the permanence of that Ministry;\r\nthat therefore all their power and patronage would be employed for the\r\npurpose of propping that Ministry, and, in case of a change, for the\r\npurpose of molesting those who might succeed to power; that they would\r\nbe subservient while their friends were in, and factious when their\r\nfriends were out? How would Lord Grey's Ministry have been situated if\r\nthe whole body of Directors had been nominated by the Duke of Wellington\r\nin 1830. I mean no imputation on the Duke of Wellington. If the present\r\nministers had to nominate Directors for four years, they would, I have\r\nno doubt, nominate men who would give no small trouble to the Duke\r\nof Wellington if he were to return to office. What we want is a body\r\nindependent of the Government, and no more than independent; not a tool\r\nof the Treasury, not a tool of the opposition. No new plan which I have\r\nheard proposed would give us such a body. The Company, strange as its\r\nconstitution may be, is such a body. It is, as a corporation, neither\r\nWhig nor Tory, neither high-church nor low-church. It cannot be charged\r\nwith having been for or against the Catholic Bill, for or against\r\nthe Reform Bill. It has constantly acted with a view not to English\r\npolitics, but to Indian politics. We have seen the country convulsed\r\nby faction. We have seen Ministers driven from office by this House,\r\nParliament dissolved in anger, general elections of unprecedented\r\nturbulence, debates of unprecedented interest. We have seen the two\r\nbranches of the Legislature placed in direct opposition to each other.\r\nWe have seen the advisers of the Crown dismissed one day, and brought\r\nback the next day on the shoulders of the people. And amidst all these\r\nagitating events the Company has preserved strict and unsuspected\r\nneutrality. This is, I think an inestimable advantage, and it is an\r\nadvantage which we must altogether forego, if we consent to adopt any of\r\nthe schemes which I have heard proposed on the other side of the House.\r\n\r\nWe must judge of the Indian government, as of all other governments, by\r\nits practical effects. According to the honourable Member for Sheffield,\r\nIndia is ill governed; and the whole fault is with the Company.\r\nInnumerable accusations, great and small, are brought by him against the\r\nDirectors. They are fond of war: they are fond of dominion: the taxation\r\nis burthensome: the laws are undigested: the roads are rough: the post\r\ngoes on foot: and for everything the Company is answerable. From\r\nthe dethronement of the Mogul princes to the mishaps of Sir Charles\r\nMetcalfe's courier, every disaster that has taken place in the East\r\nduring sixty years is laid to the charge of this Corporation. And the\r\ninference is, that all the power which they possess ought to be taken\r\nout of their hands, and transferred at once to the Crown.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, it seems to me that, for all the evils which the honourable\r\nGentleman has so pathetically recounted, the Ministers of the Crown are\r\nas much to blame as the Company; nay, much more so: for the Board of\r\nControl could, without the consent of the Directors, have redressed\r\nthose evils; and the Directors most certainly could not have redressed\r\nthem without the consent of the Board of Control. Take the case of that\r\nfrightful grievance which seems to have made the deepest impression on\r\nthe mind of the honourable Gentleman, the slowness of the mail. Why,\r\nSir, if my right honourable friend, the President of our Board thought\r\nfit, he might direct me to write to the Court and require them to frame\r\na dispatch on that subject. If the Court disobeyed, he might himself\r\nframe a dispatch ordering Lord William Bentinck to put the dawks\r\nall over Bengal on horseback. If the Court refused to send out this\r\ndispatch, the Board could apply to the King's Bench for a mandamus. If,\r\non the other hand, the Directors wished to accelerate the journeys of\r\nthe mail, and the Board were adverse to the project, the Directors could\r\ndo nothing at all. For all measures of internal policy the servants\r\nof the King are at least as deeply responsible as the Company. For all\r\nmeasures of foreign policy the servants of the King, and they alone are\r\nresponsible. I was surprised to hear the honourable Gentleman accuse the\r\nDirectors of insatiable ambition and rapacity, when he must know that\r\nno act of aggression on any native state can be committed by the Company\r\nwithout the sanction of the Board, and that, in fact, the Board has\r\nrepeatedly approved of warlike measures which were strenuously opposed\r\nby the Company. He must know, in particular, that, during the energetic\r\nand splendid administration of the Marquess of Wellesley, the company\r\nwas all for peace, and the Board all for conquest. If a line of conduct\r\nwhich the honourable Gentleman thinks unjustifiable has been followed\r\nby the Ministers of the Crown in spite of the remonstrances of\r\nthe Directors, this is surely a strange reason for turning off the\r\nDirectors, and giving the whole power unchecked to the Crown.\r\n\r\nThe honourable Member tells us that India, under the present system, is\r\nnot so rich and flourishing as she was two hundred years ago. Really,\r\nSir, I doubt whether we are in possession of sufficient data to enable\r\nus to form a judgment on that point. But the matter is of little\r\nimportance. We ought to compare India under our government, not with\r\nIndia under Acbar and his immediate successors, but with India as we\r\nfound it. The calamities through which that country passed during the\r\ninterval between the fall of the Mogul power and the establishment of\r\nthe English supremacy were sufficient to throw the people back whole\r\ncenturies. It would surely be unjust to say, that Alfred was a bad king\r\nbecause Britain, under his government, was not so rich or so civilised\r\nas in the time of the Romans.\r\n\r\nIn what state, then, did we find India? And what have we made India? We\r\nfound society throughout that vast country in a state to which history\r\nscarcely furnishes a parallel. The nearest parallel would, perhaps, be\r\nthe state of Europe during the fifth century. The Mogul empire in the\r\ntime of the successors of Aurungzebe, like the Roman empire in the time\r\nof the successors of Theodosius, was sinking under the vices of a bad\r\ninternal administration, and under the assaults of barbarous invaders.\r\nAt Delhi, as at Ravenna, there was a mock sovereign, immured in a\r\ngorgeous state prison. He was suffered to indulge in every sensual\r\npleasure. He was adored with servile prostrations. He assumed and\r\nbestowed the most magnificent titles. But, in fact, he was a mere puppet\r\nin the hands of some ambitious subject. While the Honorii and Augustuli\r\nof the East, surrounded by their fawning eunuchs, reveled and dozed\r\nwithout knowing or caring what might pass beyond the walls of their\r\npalace gardens, the provinces had ceased to respect a government which\r\ncould neither punish nor protect them. Society was a chaos. Its restless\r\nand shifting elements formed themselves every moment into some new\r\ncombination, which the next moment dissolved. In the course of a single\r\ngeneration a hundred dynasties grew up, flourished, decayed, were\r\nextinguished, were forgotten. Every adventurer who could muster a troop\r\nof horse might aspire to a throne. Every palace was every year the scene\r\nof conspiracies, treasons, revolutions, parricides. Meanwhile a rapid\r\nsuccession of Alarics and Attilas passed over the defenceless empire.\r\nA Persian invader penetrated to Delhi, and carried back in triumph\r\nthe most precious treasures of the House of Tamerlane. The Afghan soon\r\nfollowed by the same track, to glean whatever the Persian had spared.\r\nThe Jauts established themselves on the Jumna. The Seiks devastated\r\nLahore. Every part of India, from Tanjore to the Himalayas, was laid\r\nunder contribution by the Mahrattas. The people were ground down to the\r\ndust by the oppressor without and the oppressor within, by the robber\r\nfrom whom the Nabob was unable to protect them, by the Nabob who took\r\nwhatever the robber had left to them. All the evils of despotism, and\r\nall the evils of anarchy, pressed at once on that miserable race. They\r\nknew nothing of government but its exactions. Desolation was in their\r\nimperial cities, and famine all along the banks of their broad and\r\nredundant rivers. It seemed that a few more years would suffice to\r\nefface all traces of the opulence and civilisation of an earlier age.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of India when the Company began to take part in the\r\ndisputes of its ephemeral sovereigns. About eighty years have elapsed\r\nsince we appeared as auxiliaries in a contest between two rival families\r\nfor the sovereignty of a small corner of the Peninsula. From that\r\nmoment commenced a great, a stupendous process, the reconstruction of a\r\ndecomposed society. Two generations have passed away; and the process is\r\ncomplete. The scattered fragments of the empire of Aurungzebe have been\r\nunited in an empire stronger and more closely knit together than that\r\nwhich Aurungzebe ruled. The power of the new sovereigns penetrates their\r\ndominions more completely, and is far more implicitly obeyed, than was\r\nthat of the proudest princes of the Mogul dynasty.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the early history of this great revolution is chequered\r\nwith guilt and shame. It is true that the founders of our Indian Empire\r\ntoo often abused the strength which they derived from superior energy\r\nand superior knowledge. It is true that, with some of the highest\r\nqualities of the race from which they sprang, they combined some of the\r\nworst defects of the race over which they ruled. How should it have\r\nbeen otherwise? Born in humble stations, accustomed to earn a slender\r\nmaintenance by obscure industry, they found themselves transformed in\r\na few months from clerks drudging over desks, or captains in marching\r\nregiments, into statesmen and generals, with armies at their command,\r\nwith the revenues of kingdoms at their disposal, with power to make and\r\ndepose sovereigns at their pleasure. They were what it was natural that\r\nmen should be who had been raised by so rapid an ascent to so dizzy an\r\neminence, profuse and rapacious, imperious and corrupt.\r\n\r\nIt is true, then, that there was too much foundation for the\r\nrepresentations of those satirists and dramatists who held up the\r\ncharacter of the English Nabob to the derision and hatred of a former\r\ngeneration. It is true that some disgraceful intrigues, some unjust\r\nand cruel wars, some instances of odious perfidy and avarice, stain the\r\nannals of our Eastern Empire. It is true that the duties of government\r\nand legislation were long wholly neglected or carelessly performed. It\r\nis true that when the conquerors at length began to apply themselves\r\nin earnest to the discharge of their high functions, they committed the\r\nerrors natural to rulers who were but imperfectly acquainted with the\r\nlanguage and manners of their subjects. It is true that some plans,\r\nwhich were dictated by the purest and most benevolent feelings have not\r\nbeen attended by the desired success. It is true that India suffers to\r\nthis day from a heavy burden of taxation and from a defective system of\r\nlaw. It is true, I fear, that in those states which are connected with\r\nus by subsidiary alliance, all the evils of oriental despotism have\r\ntoo frequently shown themselves in their most loathsome and destructive\r\nform.\r\n\r\nAll this is true. Yet in the history and in the present state of our\r\nIndian Empire I see ample reason for exultation and for a good hope.\r\n\r\nI see that we have established order where we found confusion. I see\r\nthat the petty dynasties which were generated by the corruption of the\r\ngreat Mahometan Empire, and which, a century ago, kept all India in\r\nconstant agitation, have been quelled by one overwhelming power. I see\r\nthat the predatory tribes, which, in the middle of the last century,\r\npassed annually over the harvests of India with the destructive rapidity\r\nof a hurricane, have quailed before the valour of a braver and sterner\r\nrace, have been vanquished, scattered, hunted to their strongholds, and\r\neither extirpated by the English sword, or compelled to exchange the\r\npursuits of rapine for those of industry.\r\n\r\nI look back for many years; and I see scarcely a trace of the vices\r\nwhich blemished the splendid fame of the first conquerors of Bengal.\r\nI see peace studiously preserved. I see faith inviolably maintained\r\ntowards feeble and dependent states. I see confidence gradually infused\r\ninto the minds of suspicious neighbours. I see the horrors of war\r\nmitigated by the chivalrous and Christian spirit of Europe. I see\r\nexamples of moderation and clemency, such as I should seek in vain in\r\nthe annals of any other victorious and dominant nation. I see captive\r\ntyrants, whose treachery and cruelty might have excused a severe\r\nretribution, living in security, comfort, and dignity, under the\r\nprotection of the government which they laboured to destroy.\r\n\r\nI see a large body of civil and military functionaries resembling in\r\nnothing but capacity and valour those adventurers who, seventy years\r\nago, came hither, laden with wealth and infamy, to parade before our\r\nfathers the plundered treasures of Bengal and Tanjore. I reflect with\r\npride that to the doubtful splendour which surrounds the memory of\r\nHastings and of Clive, we can oppose the spotless glory of Elphinstone\r\nand Munro. I contemplate with reverence and delight the honourable\r\npoverty which is the evidence of rectitude firmly maintained amidst\r\nstrong temptations. I rejoice to see my countrymen, after ruling\r\nmillions of subjects, after commanding victorious armies, after\r\ndictating terms of peace at the gates of hostile capitals, after\r\nadministering the revenues of great provinces, after judging the causes\r\nof wealthy Zemindars, after residing at the courts of tributary Kings,\r\nreturn to their native land with no more than a decent competence.\r\n\r\nI see a government anxiously bent on the public good. Even in its errors\r\nI recognise a paternal feeling towards the great people committed to\r\nits charge. I see toleration strictly maintained: yet I see bloody\r\nand degrading superstitions gradually losing their power. I see the\r\nmorality, the philosophy, the taste of Europe, beginning to produce a\r\nsalutary effect on the hearts and understandings of our subjects. I see\r\nthe public mind of India, that public mind which we found debased\r\nand contracted by the worst forms of political and religious tyranny,\r\nexpanding itself to just and noble views of the ends of government and\r\nof the social duties of man.\r\n\r\nI see evils: but I see the government actively employed in the work\r\nof remedying those evils. The taxation is heavy; but the work of\r\nretrenchment is unsparingly pursued. The mischiefs arising from the\r\nsystem of subsidiary alliance are great: but the rulers of India are\r\nfully aware of those mischiefs, and are engaged in guarding against\r\nthem. Wherever they now interfere for the purpose of supporting a native\r\ngovernment, they interfere also for the purpose of reforming it.\r\n\r\nSeeing these things, then, am I prepared to discard the Company as\r\nan organ of government? I am not. Assuredly I will never shrink from\r\ninnovation where I see reason to believe that innovation will\r\nbe improvement. That the present Government does not shrink from\r\ninnovations which it considers as improvements the bill now before the\r\nHouse sufficiently shows. But surely the burden of the proof lies on the\r\ninnovators. They are bound to show that there is a fair probability\r\nof obtaining some advantage before they call upon us to take up the\r\nfoundations of the Indian government. I have no superstitious veneration\r\nfor the Court of Directors or the Court of Proprietors. Find me a better\r\nCouncil: find me a better constituent body: and I am ready for a change.\r\nBut of all the substitutes for the Company which have hitherto been\r\nsuggested, not one has been proved to be better than the Company; and\r\nmost of them I could, I think, easily prove to be worse. Circumstances\r\nmight force us to hazard a change. If the Company were to refuse to\r\naccept of the government unless we would grant pecuniary terms which I\r\nthought extravagant, or unless we gave up the clauses in this bill which\r\npermit Europeans to hold landed property and natives to hold office, I\r\nwould take them at their word. But I will not discard them in the mere\r\nrage of experiment.\r\n\r\nDo I call the government of India a perfect government? Very far from\r\nit. No nation can be perfectly well governed till it is competent to\r\ngovern itself. I compare the Indian government with other governments of\r\nthe same class, with despotisms, with military despotisms, with foreign\r\nmilitary despotisms; and I find none that approaches it in excellence.\r\nI compare it with the government of the Roman provinces, with the\r\ngovernment of the Spanish colonies; and I am proud of my country and my\r\nage. Here are a hundred millions of people under the absolute rule of\r\na few strangers, differing from them physically, differing from them\r\nmorally, mere Mamelukes, not born in the country which they rule,\r\nnot meaning to lay their bones in it. If you require me to make this\r\ngovernment as good as that of England, France, or the United States of\r\nAmerica, I own frankly that I can do no such thing. Reasoning a priori,\r\nI should have come to the conclusion that such a government must be a\r\nhorrible tyranny. It is a source of constant amazement to me that it is\r\nso good as I find it to be. I will not, therefore, in a case in which\r\nI have neither principles nor precedents to guide me, pull down the\r\nexisting system on account of its theoretical defects. For I know that\r\nany system which I could put in its place would be equally condemned by\r\ntheory, while it would not be equally sanctioned by experience.\r\n\r\nSome change in the constitution of the Company was, as I have shown,\r\nrendered inevitable by the opening of the China Trade; and it was\r\nthe duty of the Government to take care that the change should not\r\nbe prejudicial to India. There were many ways in which the compromise\r\nbetween commerce and territory might have been effected. We might have\r\ntaken the assets, and paid a sum down, leaving the Company to invest\r\nthat sum as they chose. We might have offered English security with a\r\nlower interest. We might have taken the course which the late ministers\r\ndesigned to take. They would have left the Company in possession of the\r\nmeans of carrying on its trade in competition with private merchants. My\r\nfirm belief is that, if this course had been taken, the Company must,\r\nin a very few years, have abandoned the trade, or the trade would have\r\nruined the Company. It was not, however, solely or principally by regard\r\nfor the interest of the Company, or of English merchants generally, that\r\nthe Government was guided on this occasion. The course which appeared to\r\nus the most likely to promote the interests of our Eastern Empire was to\r\nmake the proprietors of India stock creditors of the Indian territory.\r\nTheir interest will thus be in a great measure the same with the\r\ninterest of the people whom they are to rule. Their income will depend\r\non the revenues of their empire. The revenues of their empire\r\nwill depend on the manner in which the affairs of that empire are\r\nadministered. We furnish them with the strongest motives to watch over\r\nthe interests of the cultivator and the trader, to maintain peace, to\r\ncarry on with vigour the work of retrenchment, to detect and punish\r\nextortion and corruption. Though they live at a distance from India,\r\nthough few of them have ever seen or may ever see the people whom they\r\nrule, they will have a great stake in the happiness of their subjects.\r\nIf their misgovernment should produce disorder in the finances, they\r\nwill themselves feel the effects of that disorder in their own household\r\nexpenses. I believe this to be, next to a representative constitution,\r\nthe constitution which is the best security for good government. A\r\nrepresentative constitution India cannot at present have. And we have\r\ntherefore, I think, given her the best constitution of which she is\r\ncapable.\r\n\r\nOne word as to the new arrangement which we propose with respect to the\r\npatronage. It is intended to introduce the principle of competition\r\nin the disposal of writerships; and from this change I cannot but\r\nanticipate the happiest results. The civil servants of the Company are\r\nundoubtedly a highly respectable body of men; and in that body, as in\r\nevery large body, there are some persons of very eminent ability. I\r\nrejoice most cordially to see this. I rejoice to see that the standard\r\nof morality is so high in England, that intelligence is so generally\r\ndiffused through England, that young persons who are taken from the mass\r\nof society, by favour and not by merit, and who are therefore only\r\nfair samples of the mass, should, when placed in situations of high\r\nimportance, be so seldom found wanting. But it is not the less true that\r\nIndia is entitled to the service of the best talents which England can\r\nspare. That the average of intelligence and virtue is very high in\r\nthis country is matter for honest exultation. But it is no reason for\r\nemploying average men where you can obtain superior men. Consider\r\ntoo, Sir, how rapidly the public mind of India is advancing, how much\r\nattention is already paid by the higher classes of the natives to those\r\nintellectual pursuits on the cultivation of which the superiority of\r\nthe European race to the rest of mankind principally depends. Surely,\r\nin such circumstances, from motives of selfish policy, if from no higher\r\nmotive, we ought to fill the magistracies of our Eastern Empire with men\r\nwho may do honour to their country, with men who may represent the best\r\npart of the English nation. This, Sir, is our object; and we believe\r\nthat by the plan which is now proposed this object will be attained. It\r\nis proposed that for every vacancy in the civil service four candidates\r\nshall be named, and the best candidate selected by examination. We\r\nconceive that, under this system, the persons sent out will be young men\r\nabove par, young men superior either in talents or in diligence to the\r\nmass. It is said, I know, that examinations in Latin, in Greek, and in\r\nmathematics, are no tests of what men will prove to be in life. I am\r\nperfectly aware that they are not infallible tests: but that they are\r\ntests I confidently maintain. Look at every walk of life, at this House,\r\nat the other House, at the Bar, at the Bench, at the Church, and see\r\nwhether it be not true that those who attain high distinction in the\r\nworld were generally men who were distinguished in their academic\r\ncareer. Indeed, Sir, this objection would prove far too much even\r\nfor those who use it. It would prove that there is no use at all in\r\neducation. Why should we put boys out of their way? Why should we force\r\na lad, who would much rather fly a kite or trundle a hoop, to learn his\r\nLatin Grammar? Why should we keep a young man to his Thucydides or his\r\nLaplace, when he would much rather be shooting? Education would be mere\r\nuseless torture, if, at two or three and twenty, a man who had neglected\r\nhis studies were exactly on a par with a man who had applied himself to\r\nthem, exactly as likely to perform all the offices of public life with\r\ncredit to himself and with advantage to society. Whether the English\r\nsystem of education be good or bad is not now the question. Perhaps I\r\nmay think that too much time is given to the ancient languages and\r\nto the abstract sciences. But what then? Whatever be the languages,\r\nwhatever be the sciences, which it is, in any age or country, the\r\nfashion to teach, the persons who become the greatest proficients in\r\nthose languages and those sciences will generally be the flower of\r\nthe youth, the most acute, the most industrious, the most ambitious\r\nof honourable distinctions. If the Ptolemaic system were taught\r\nat Cambridge instead of the Newtonian, the senior wrangler would\r\nnevertheless be in general a superior man to the wooden spoon. If,\r\ninstead of learning Greek, we learned the Cherokee, the man who\r\nunderstood the Cherokee best, who made the most correct and melodious\r\nCherokee verses, who comprehended most accurately the effect of the\r\nCherokee particles, would generally be a superior man to him who was\r\ndestitute of these accomplishments. If astrology were taught at our\r\nUniversities, the young man who cast nativities best would generally\r\nturn out a superior man. If alchymy were taught, the young man who\r\nshowed most activity in the pursuit of the philosopher's stone would\r\ngenerally turn out a superior man.\r\n\r\nI will only add one other observation on this subject. Although I\r\nam inclined to think that too exclusive an attention is paid in the\r\neducation of young English gentlemen to the dead languages, I conceive\r\nthat when you are choosing men to fill situations for which the very\r\nfirst and most indispensable qualification is familiarity with foreign\r\nlanguages, it would be difficult to find a better test of their fitness\r\nthan their classical acquirements.\r\n\r\nSome persons have expressed doubts as to the possibility of procuring\r\nfair examinations. I am quite sure that no person who has been either at\r\nCambridge or at Oxford can entertain such doubts. I feel, indeed, that I\r\nought to apologise for even noticing an objection so frivolous.\r\n\r\nNext to the opening of the China trade, Sir, the change most eagerly\r\ndemanded by the English people was, that the restrictions on the\r\nadmission of Europeans to India should be removed. In this change there\r\nare undoubtedly very great advantages. The chief advantage is, I think,\r\nthe improvement which the minds of our native subjects may be expected\r\nto derive from free intercourse with a people far advanced beyond\r\nthemselves in intellectual cultivation. I cannot deny, however, that the\r\nadvantages are attended with some danger.\r\n\r\nThe danger is that the new comers, belonging to the ruling nation,\r\nresembling in colour, in language, in manners, those who hold supreme\r\nmilitary and political power, and differing in all these respects from\r\nthe great mass of the population, may consider themselves as a superior\r\nclass, and may trample on the indigenous race. Hitherto there have been\r\nstrong restraints on Europeans resident in India. Licences were not\r\neasily obtained. Those residents who were in the service of the Company\r\nhad obvious motives for conducting themselves with propriety. If they\r\nincurred the serious displeasure of the Government, their hopes of\r\npromotion were blighted. Even those who were not in the public service\r\nwere subject to the formidable power which the Government possessed of\r\nbanishing them at its pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe license of the Government will now no longer be necessary to persons\r\nwho desire to reside in the settled provinces of India. The power of\r\narbitrary deportation is withdrawn. Unless, therefore, we mean to leave\r\nthe natives exposed to the tyranny and insolence of every profligate\r\nadventurer who may visit the East, we must place the European under\r\nthe same power which legislates for the Hindoo. No man loves political\r\nfreedom more than I. But a privilege enjoyed by a few individuals, in\r\nthe midst of a vast population who do not enjoy it, ought not to be\r\ncalled freedom. It is tyranny. In the West Indies I have not the\r\nleast doubt that the existence of the Trial by Jury and of Legislative\r\nAssemblies has tended to make the condition of the slaves worse than it\r\nwould otherwise have been. Or, to go to India itself for an instance,\r\nthough I fully believe that a mild penal code is better than a severe\r\npenal code, the worst of all systems was surely that of having a mild\r\ncode for the Brahmins, who sprang from the head of the Creator, while\r\nthere was a severe code for the Sudras, who sprang from his feet. India\r\nhas suffered enough already from the distinction of castes, and from\r\nthe deeply rooted prejudices which that distinction has engendered. God\r\nforbid that we should inflict on her the curse of a new caste, that we\r\nshould send her a new breed of Brahmins, authorised to treat all the\r\nnative population as Parias!\r\n\r\nWith a view to the prevention of this evil, we propose to give to the\r\nSupreme Government the power of legislating for Europeans as well as for\r\nnatives. We propose that the regulations of the Government shall bind\r\nthe King's Court as they bind all other courts, and that registration\r\nby the Judges of the King's Courts shall no longer be necessary to give\r\nvalidity to those regulations within the towns of Calcutta, Madras, and\r\nBombay.\r\n\r\nI could scarcely, Sir, believe my ears when I heard this part of our\r\nplan condemned in another place. I should have thought that it would\r\nhave been received with peculiar favour in that quarter where it has met\r\nwith the most severe condemnation. What, at present, is the case? If the\r\nSupreme Court and the Government differ on a question of jurisdiction,\r\nor on a question of legislation within the towns which are the seats of\r\nGovernment, there is absolutely no umpire but the Imperial Parliament.\r\nThe device of putting one wild elephant between two tame elephants was\r\ningenious: but it may not always be practicable. Suppose a tame elephant\r\nbetween two wild elephants, or suppose that the whole herd should run\r\nwild together. The thing is not without example. And is it not most\r\nunjust and ridiculous that, on one side of a ditch, the edict of the\r\nGovernor General should have the force of law, and that on the other\r\nside it should be of no effect unless registered by the Judges of the\r\nSupreme Court? If the registration be a security for good legislation,\r\nwe are bound to give that security to all classes of our subjects. If\r\nthe registration be not a security for good legislation, why give it to\r\nany? Is the system good? Extend it. Is it bad! Abolish it. But in the\r\nname of common sense do not leave it as it is. It is as absurd as our\r\nold law of sanctuary. The law which authorises imprisonment for debt\r\nmay be good or bad. But no man in his senses can approve of the ancient\r\nsystem under which a debtor who might be arrested in Fleet Street was\r\nsafe as soon as he had scampered into Whitefriars. Just in the same way,\r\ndoubts may fairly be entertained about the expediency of allowing four\r\nor five persons to make laws for India; but to allow them to make laws\r\nfor all India without the Mahratta ditch, and to except Calcutta, is the\r\nheight of absurdity.\r\n\r\nI say, therefore, that either you must enlarge the power of the Supreme\r\nCourt, and give it a general veto on laws, or you must enlarge the\r\npower of the Government, and make its regulations binding on all\r\nCourts without distinction. The former course no person has ventured to\r\npropose. To the latter course objections have been made; but objections\r\nwhich to me, I must own, seem altogether frivolous.\r\n\r\nIt is acknowledged that of late years inconvenience has arisen from the\r\nrelation in which the Supreme Court stands to the Government. But, it is\r\nsaid, that Court was originally instituted for the protection of natives\r\nagainst Europeans. The wise course would therefore be to restore its\r\noriginal character.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, the fact is, that the Supreme Court has never been so\r\nmischievous as during the first ten years of its power, or so\r\nrespectable as it has lately been. Everybody who knows anything of its\r\nearly history knows, that, during a considerable time, it was the terror\r\nof Bengal, the scourge of the native population, the screen of European\r\ndelinquents, a convenient tool of the Government for all purposes of\r\nevil, an insurmountable obstacle to the Government in all undertakings\r\nfor the public good; that its proceedings were made up of pedantry,\r\ncruelty, and corruption; that its disputes with the Government were at\r\none time on the point of breaking up the whole fabric of society; and\r\nthat a convulsion was averted only by the dexterous policy of Warren\r\nHastings, who at last bought off the opposition of the Chief Justice for\r\neight thousand pounds a year. It is notorious that, while the Supreme\r\nCourt opposed Hastings in all his best measures, it was a thoroughgoing\r\naccomplice in his worst; that it took part in the most scandalous of\r\nthose proceedings which, fifty years ago, roused the indignation of\r\nParliament and of the country; that it assisted in the spoliation of the\r\nprincesses of Oude; that it passed sentence of death on Nuncomar. And\r\nthis is the Court which we are to restore from its present state of\r\ndegeneracy to its original purity. This is the protection which we are\r\nto give to the natives against the Europeans. Sir, so far is it from\r\nbeing true that the character of the Supreme Court has deteriorated,\r\nthat it has, perhaps, improved more than any other institution in India.\r\nBut the evil lies deep in the nature of the institution itself. The\r\njudges have in our time deserved the greatest respect. Their judgment\r\nand integrity have done much to mitigate the vices of the system.\r\nThe worst charge that can be brought against any of them is that of\r\npertinacity, disinterested, conscientious pertinacity, in error. The\r\nreal evil is the state of the law. You have two supreme powers in India.\r\nThere is no arbitrator except a Legislature fifteen thousand miles off.\r\nSuch a system is on the face of it an absurdity in politics. My\r\nwonder is, not that this system has several times been on the point\r\nof producing fatal consequences to the peace and resources of\r\nIndia;--those, I think, are the words in which Warren Hastings described\r\nthe effect of the contest between his Government and the Judges;--but\r\nthat it has not actually produced such consequences. The most\r\ndistinguished members of the Indian Government, the most distinguished\r\nJudges of the Supreme Court, call upon you to reform this system. Sir\r\nCharles Metcalfe, Sir Charles Grey, represent with equal urgency the\r\nexpediency of having one single paramount council armed with legislative\r\npower. The admission of Europeans to India renders it absolutely\r\nnecessary not to delay our decision. The effect of that admission would\r\nbe to raise a hundred questions, to produce a hundred contests between\r\nthe Council and the judicature. The Government would be paralysed at the\r\nprecise moment at which all its energy was required. While the two equal\r\npowers were acting in opposite directions, the whole machine of the\r\nstate would stand still. The Europeans would be uncontrolled. The\r\nnatives would be unprotected. The consequences I will not pretend to\r\nforesee. Everything beyond is darkness and confusion.\r\n\r\nHaving given to the Government supreme legislative power, we next\r\npropose to give to it for a time the assistance of a commission for the\r\npurpose of digesting and reforming the laws of India, so that those laws\r\nmay, as soon as possible, be formed into a Code. Gentleman of whom I\r\nwish to speak with the highest respect have expressed a doubt whether\r\nIndia be at present in a fit state to receive a benefit which is not yet\r\nenjoyed by this free and highly civilised country. Sir, I can allow to\r\nthis argument very little weight beyond that which it derives from the\r\npersonal authority of those who use it. For, in the first place, our\r\nfreedom and our high civilisation make this improvement, desirable as\r\nit must always be, less indispensably necessary to us than to our Indian\r\nsubjects; and in the next place, our freedom and civilisation, I fear,\r\nmake it far more difficult for us to obtain this benefit for ourselves\r\nthan to bestow it on them.\r\n\r\nI believe that no country ever stood so much in need of a code of laws\r\nas India; and I believe also that there never was a country in which the\r\nwant might so easily be supplied. I said that there were many points of\r\nanalogy between the state of that country after the fall of the Mogul\r\npower, and the state of Europe after the fall of the Roman empire. In\r\none respect the analogy is very striking. As there were in Europe then,\r\nso there are in India now, several systems of law widely differing from\r\neach other, but coexisting and coequal. The indigenous population has\r\nits own laws. Each of the successive races of conquerors has brought\r\nwith it its own peculiar jurisprudence: the Mussulman his Koran and the\r\ninnumerable commentators on the Koran; the Englishman his Statute Book\r\nand his Term Reports. As there were established in Italy, at one and\r\nthe same time, the Roman Law, the Lombard law, the Ripuarian law, the\r\nBavarian law, and the Salic law, so we have now in our Eastern empire\r\nHindoo law, Mahometan law, Parsee law, English law, perpetually mingling\r\nwith each other and disturbing each other, varying with the person,\r\nvarying with the place. In one and the same cause the process and\r\npleadings are in the fashion of one nation, the judgment is according\r\nto the laws of another. An issue is evolved according to the rules\r\nof Westminster, and decided according to those of Benares. The only\r\nMahometan book in the nature of a code is the Koran; the only Hindoo\r\nbook, the Institutes. Everybody who knows those books knows that they\r\nprovide for a very small part of the cases which must arise in every\r\ncommunity. All beyond them is comment and tradition. Our regulations in\r\ncivil matters do not define rights, but merely establish remedies. If\r\na point of Hindoo law arises, the Judge calls on the Pundit for an\r\nopinion. If a point of Mahometan law arises, the Judge applies to the\r\nCauzee. What the integrity of these functionaries is, we may learn from\r\nSir William Jones. That eminent man declared that he could not answer\r\nit to his conscience to decide any point of law on the faith of a Hindoo\r\nexpositor. Sir Thomas Strange confirms this declaration. Even if there\r\nwere no suspicion of corruption on the part of the interpreters of the\r\nlaw, the science which they profess is in such a state of confusion that\r\nno reliance can be placed on their answers. Sir Francis Macnaghten tells\r\nus, that it is a delusion to fancy that there is any known and fixed law\r\nunder which the Hindoo people live; that texts may be produced on any\r\nside of any question; that expositors equal in authority perpetually\r\ncontradict each other: that the obsolete law is perpetually confounded\r\nwith the law actually in force; and that the first lesson to be\r\nimpressed on a functionary who has to administer Hindoo law is that it\r\nis vain to think of extracting certainty from the books of the jurist.\r\nThe consequence is that in practice the decisions of the tribunals are\r\naltogether arbitrary. What is administered is not law, but a kind of\r\nrude and capricious equity. I asked an able and excellent judge lately\r\nreturned from India how one of our Zillah Courts would decide\r\nseveral legal questions of great importance, questions not involving\r\nconsiderations of religion or of caste, mere questions of commercial\r\nlaw. He told me that it was a mere lottery. He knew how he should\r\nhimself decide them. But he knew nothing more. I asked a most\r\ndistinguished civil servant of the Company, with reference to the clause\r\nin this Bill on the subject of slavery, whether at present, if a dancing\r\ngirl ran away from her master, the judge would force her to go back.\r\n\"Some judges,\" he said, \"send a girl back. Others set her at liberty.\r\nThe whole is a mere matter of chance. Everything depends on the temper\r\nof the individual judge.\"\r\n\r\nEven in this country we have had complaints of judge-made law; even in\r\nthis country, where the standard of morality is higher than in almost\r\nany other part of the world; where, during several generations, not\r\none depositary of our legal traditions has incurred the suspicion of\r\npersonal corruption; where there are popular institutions; where every\r\ndecision is watched by a shrewd and learned audience; where there is an\r\nintelligent and observant public; where every remarkable case is fully\r\nreported in a hundred newspapers; where, in short, there is everything\r\nwhich can mitigate the evils of such a system. But judge-made law, where\r\nthere is an absolute government and a lax morality, where there is no\r\nbar and no public, is a curse and a scandal not to be endured. It is\r\ntime that the magistrate should know what law he is to administer, that\r\nthe subject should know under what law he is to live. We do not mean\r\nthat all the people of India should live under the same law: far from\r\nit: there is not a word in the bill, there was not a word in my right\r\nhonourable friend's speech, susceptible of such an interpretation.\r\nWe know how desirable that object is; but we also know that it is\r\nunattainable. We know that respect must be paid to feelings generated by\r\ndifferences of religion, of nation, and of caste. Much, I am persuaded,\r\nmay be done to assimilate the different systems of law without wounding\r\nthose feelings. But, whether we assimilate those systems or not, let us\r\nascertain them; let us digest them. We propose no rash innovation; we\r\nwish to give no shock to the prejudices of any part of our subjects. Our\r\nprinciple is simply this; uniformity where you can have it: diversity\r\nwhere you must have it; but in all cases certainty.\r\n\r\nAs I believe that India stands more in need of a code than any other\r\ncountry in the world, I believe also that there is no country on which\r\nthat great benefit can more easily be conferred. A code is almost the\r\nonly blessing, perhaps is the only blessing, which absolute governments\r\nare better fitted to confer on a nation than popular governments.\r\nThe work of digesting a vast and artificial system of unwritten\r\njurisprudence is far more easily performed, and far better performed, by\r\nfew minds than by many, by a Napoleon than by a Chamber of Deputies and\r\na Chamber of Peers, by a government like that of Prussia or Denmark\r\nthan by a government like that of England. A quiet knot of two or three\r\nveteran jurists is an infinitely better machinery for such a purpose\r\nthan a large popular assembly divided, as such assemblies almost always\r\nare, into adverse factions. This seems to me, therefore, to be precisely\r\nthat point of time at which the advantage of a complete written code of\r\nlaws may most easily be conferred on India. It is a work which cannot\r\nbe well performed in an age of barbarism, which cannot without great\r\ndifficulty be performed in an age of freedom. It is a work which\r\nespecially belongs to a government like that of India, to an enlightened\r\nand paternal despotism.\r\n\r\nI have detained the House so long, Sir, that I will defer what I had to\r\nsay on some parts of this measure, important parts, indeed, but far less\r\nimportant, as I think, than those to which I have adverted, till we are\r\nin Committee. There is, however, one part of the bill on which, after\r\nwhat has recently passed elsewhere, I feel myself irresistibly impelled\r\nto say a few words. I allude to that wise, that benevolent, that noble\r\nclause which enacts that no native of our Indian empire shall, by reason\r\nof his colour, his descent, or his religion, be incapable of holding\r\noffice. At the risk of being called by that nickname which is regarded\r\nas the most opprobrious of all nicknames by men of selfish hearts and\r\ncontracted minds, at the risk of being called a philosopher, I must say\r\nthat, to the last day of my life, I shall be proud of having been one\r\nof those who assisted in the framing of the bill which contains that\r\nclause. We are told that the time can never come when the natives of\r\nIndia can be admitted to high civil and military office. We are told\r\nthat this is the condition on which we hold our power. We are told that\r\nwe are bound to confer on our subjects every benefit--which they\r\nare capable of enjoying?--no;--which it is in our power to confer\r\non them?--no;--but which we can confer on them without hazard to the\r\nperpetuity of our own domination. Against that proposition I solemnly\r\nprotest as inconsistent alike with sound policy and sound morality.\r\n\r\nI am far, very far, from wishing to proceed hastily in this most\r\ndelicate matter. I feel that, for the good of India itself, the\r\nadmission of natives to high office must be effected by slow degrees.\r\nBut that, when the fulness of time is come, when the interest of India\r\nrequires the change, we ought to refuse to make that change lest we\r\nshould endanger our own power, this is a doctrine of which I cannot\r\nthink without indignation. Governments, like men, may buy existence too\r\ndear. \"Propter vitam vivendi perdere causas,\" is a despicable policy\r\nboth in individuals and in states. In the present case, such a policy\r\nwould be not only despicable, but absurd. The mere extent of empire\r\nis not necessarily an advantage. To many governments it has been\r\ncumbersome; to some it has been fatal. It will be allowed by every\r\nstatesman of our time that the prosperity of a community is made up of\r\nthe prosperity of those who compose the community, and that it is the\r\nmost childish ambition to covet dominion which adds to no man's comfort\r\nor security. To the great trading nation, to the great manufacturing\r\nnation, no progress which any portion of the human race can make in\r\nknowledge, in taste for the conveniences of life, or in the wealth by\r\nwhich those conveniences are produced, can be matter of indifference.\r\nIt is scarcely possible to calculate the benefits which we might derive\r\nfrom the diffusion of European civilisation among the vast population of\r\nthe East. It would be, on the most selfish view of the case, far better\r\nfor us that the people of India were well governed and independent of\r\nus, than ill governed and subject to us; that they were ruled by their\r\nown kings, but wearing our broadcloth, and working with our cutlery,\r\nthan that they were performing their salams to English collectors and\r\nEnglish magistrates, but were too ignorant to value, or too poor to buy,\r\nEnglish manufactures. To trade with civilised men is infinitely more\r\nprofitable than to govern savages. That would, indeed, be a doting\r\nwisdom, which, in order that India might remain a dependency, would make\r\nit an useless and costly dependency, which would keep a hundred millions\r\nof men from being our customers in order that they might continue to be\r\nour slaves.\r\n\r\nIt was, as Bernier tells us, the practice of the miserable tyrants whom\r\nhe found in India, when they dreaded the capacity and spirit of some\r\ndistinguished subject, and yet could not venture to murder him, to\r\nadminister to him a daily dose of the pousta, a preparation of opium,\r\nthe effect of which was in a few months to destroy all the bodily and\r\nmental powers of the wretch who was drugged with it, and to turn him\r\ninto a helpless idiot. The detestable artifice, more horrible than\r\nassassination itself, was worthy of those who employed it. It is no\r\nmodel for the English nation. We shall never consent to administer the\r\npousta to a whole community, to stupefy and paralyse a great people whom\r\nGod has committed to our charge, for the wretched purpose of rendering\r\nthem more amenable to our control. What is power worth if it is\r\nfounded on vice, on ignorance, and on misery; if we can hold it only\r\nby violating the most sacred duties which as governors we owe to the\r\ngoverned, and which, as a people blessed with far more than an ordinary\r\nmeasure of political liberty and of intellectual light, we owe to a race\r\ndebased by three thousand years of despotism and priestcraft? We are\r\nfree, we are civilised, to little purpose, if we grudge to any portion\r\nof the human race an equal measure of freedom and civilisation.\r\n\r\nAre we to keep the people of India ignorant in order that we may keep\r\nthem submissive? Or do we think that we can give them knowledge without\r\nawakening ambition? Or do we mean to awaken ambition and to provide it\r\nwith no legitimate vent? Who will answer any of these questions in the\r\naffirmative? Yet one of them must be answered in the affirmative, by\r\nevery person who maintains that we ought permanently to exclude the\r\nnatives from high office. I have no fears. The path of duty is plain\r\nbefore us: and it is also the path of wisdom, of national prosperity, of\r\nnational honour.\r\n\r\nThe destinies of our Indian empire are covered with thick darkness. It\r\nis difficult to form any conjecture as to the fate reserved for a\r\nstate which resembles no other in history, and which forms by itself\r\na separate class of political phenomena. The laws which regulate its\r\ngrowth and its decay are still unknown to us. It may be that the public\r\nmind of India may expand under our system till it has outgrown that\r\nsystem; that by good government we may educate our subjects into a\r\ncapacity for better government; that, having become instructed in\r\nEuropean knowledge, they may, in some future age, demand European\r\ninstitutions. Whether such a day will ever come I know not. But never\r\nwill I attempt to avert or to retard it. Whenever it comes, it will be\r\nthe proudest day in English history. To have found a great people sunk\r\nin the lowest depths of slavery and superstition, to have so ruled\r\nthem as to have made them desirous and capable of all the privileges of\r\ncitizens, would indeed be a title to glory all our own. The sceptre may\r\npass away from us. Unforeseen accidents may derange our most profound\r\nschemes of policy. Victory may be inconstant to our arms. But there are\r\ntriumphs which are followed by no reverse. There is an empire exempt\r\nfrom all natural causes of decay. Those triumphs are the pacific\r\ntriumphs of reason over barbarism; that empire is the imperishable\r\nempire of our arts and our morals, our literature and our laws.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDINBURGH ELECTION, 1839. (MAY 29, 1839) A SPEECH DELIVERED AT EDINBURGH\r\nON THE 29TH OF MAY 1839.\r\n\r\nThe elevation of Mr Abercromby to the peerage in May 1839, caused a\r\nvacancy in the representation of the city of Edinburgh. A meeting of\r\nthe electors was called to consider of the manner in which the vacancy\r\nshould be supplied. At this meeting the following Speech was made.\r\n\r\nMy Lord Provost and Gentlemen,--At the request of a very large and\r\nrespectable portion of your body, I appear before you as a candidate\r\nfor a high and solemn trust, which, uninvited, I should have thought\r\nit presumption to solicit, but which, thus invited, I should think it\r\ncowardice to decline. If I had felt myself justified in following my own\r\ninclinations, I am not sure that even a summons so honourable as that\r\nwhich I have received would have been sufficient to draw me away from\r\npursuits far better suited to my taste and temper than the turmoil of\r\npolitical warfare. But I feel that my lot is cast in times in which\r\nno man is free to judge, merely according to his own taste and temper,\r\nwhether he will devote himself to active or to contemplative life; in\r\ntimes in which society has a right to demand, from every one of its\r\nmembers, active and strenuous exertions. I have, therefore, obeyed your\r\ncall; and I now present myself before you for the purpose of offering\r\nto you, not, what I am sure you would reject with disdain, flattery,\r\ndegrading alike to a candidate, and to a constituent body; but such\r\nreasonable, candid, and manly explanations as become the mouth of a free\r\nman ambitious of the confidence of a free people.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary for me to say that I stand here unconnected with\r\nthis great community. It would be mere affectation not to acknowledge\r\nthat with respect to local questions I have much to learn; but I hope\r\nthat you will find in me no sluggish or inattentive learner. From an\r\nearly age I have felt a strong interest in Edinburgh, although attached\r\nto Edinburgh by no other ties than those which are common to me with\r\nmultitudes; that tie which attaches every man of Scottish blood to the\r\nancient and renowned capital of our race; that tie which attaches every\r\nstudent of history to the spot ennobled by so many great and memorable\r\nevents; that tie which attaches every traveller of taste to the most\r\nbeautiful of British cities; and that tie which attaches every lover\r\nof literature to a place which, since it has ceased to be the seat of\r\nempire, has derived from poetry, philosophy, and eloquence a far higher\r\ndistinction than empire can bestow. If to those ties it shall now be\r\nyour pleasure to add a tie still closer and more peculiar, I can only\r\nassure you that it shall be the study of my life so to conduct myself\r\nin these our troubled times that you may have no reason to be ashamed of\r\nyour choice.\r\n\r\nThose gentlemen who invited me to appear as a candidate before you were\r\ndoubtless acquainted with the part which I took in public affairs during\r\nthe three first Parliaments of the late King. Circumstances have since\r\nthat time undergone great alteration; but no alteration has taken place\r\nin my principles. I do not mean to say that thought, discussion, and the\r\nnew phenomena produced by the operation of a new representative system,\r\nhave not led me to modify some of my views on questions of detail; but,\r\nwith respect to the fundamental principles of government, my opinions\r\nare still what they were when, in 1831 and 1832, I took part, according\r\nto the measure of my abilities, in that great pacific victory which\r\npurified the representative system of England, and which first gave a\r\nreal representative system to Scotland. Even at that time, Gentlemen,\r\nthe leaning of my mind was in favour of one measure to which the\r\nillustrious leader of the Whig party, whose name ought never to be\r\nmentioned without gratitude and reverence in any assembly of British\r\nelectors, I mean Earl Grey, was understood to entertain strong\r\nobjections, and to which his Cabinet, as a Cabinet, was invariably\r\nopposed. I speak of the vote by ballot. All that has passed since that\r\ntime confirms me in the view which I was then inclined to take of\r\nthat important question. At the same time I do not think that all the\r\nadvantages are on one side and all the disadvantages on the other. I\r\nmust admit that the effect of the practice of secret voting would be to\r\nwithdraw the voter from the operation of some salutary and honourable,\r\nas well as of some pernicious and degrading motives. But seeing, as\r\nI cannot help seeing, that the practice of intimidation, instead of\r\ndiminishing, is gaining ground, I am compelled to consider whether the\r\ntime has not arrived when we are bound to apply what seems the only\r\nefficient remedy. And I am compelled to consider whether, in doing so,\r\nI am not strictly following the principles of the Reform Bill to the\r\nlegitimate conclusions. For surely those who supported the Reform Bill\r\nintended to give the people of Britain a reality, not a delusion; to\r\ndestroy nomination, and not to make an outward show of destroying it;\r\nto bestow the franchise, and not the name of the franchise; and least of\r\nall, to give suffering and humiliation under the name of the franchise.\r\nIf men are to be returned to Parliament, not by popular election, but\r\nby nomination, then I say without hesitation that the ancient system was\r\nmuch the best. Both systems alike sent men to Parliament who were not\r\nfreely chosen by independent constituent bodies: but under the old\r\nsystem there was little or no need of intimidation, while, under the new\r\nsystem, we have the misery and disgrace produced by intimidation added\r\nto the process. If, therefore, we are to have nomination, I prefer the\r\nnomination which used to take place at Old Sarum to the nomination which\r\nnow takes place at Newark. In both cases you have members returned at\r\nthe will of one landed proprietor: but at Newark you have two hundred\r\nejectments into the bargain, to say nothing of the mortification and\r\nremorse endured by all those who, though they were not ejected, yet\r\nvoted against their consciences from fear of ejectment.\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps no point on which good men of all parties are more\r\ncompletely agreed than on the necessity of restraining and punishing\r\ncorruption in the election of Members of Parliament. The evils of\r\ncorruption are doubtless very great; but it appears to me that those\r\nevils which are attributed to corruption may, with equal justice, be\r\nattributed to intimidation, and that intimidation produces also some\r\nmonstrous evils with which corruption cannot be reproached. In both\r\ncases alike the elector commits a breach of trust. In both cases alike\r\nhe employs for his own advantage an important power which was confided\r\nto him, that it might be used, to the best of his judgment, for the\r\ngeneral good of the community. Thus far corruption and intimidation\r\noperate in the same manner. But there is this difference betwixt the two\r\nsystems; corruption operates by giving pleasure, intimidation by giving\r\npain. To give a poor man five pounds causes no pain: on the contrary\r\nit produces pleasure. It is in itself no bad act: indeed, if the five\r\npounds were given on another occasion, and without a corrupt object, it\r\nmight pass for a benevolent act. But to tell a man that you will reduce\r\nhim to a situation in which he will miss his former comforts, and in\r\nwhich his family will be forced to beg their bread, is a cruel act.\r\nCorruption has a sort of illegitimate relationship to benevolence, and\r\nengenders some feelings of a cordial and friendly nature. There is a\r\nnotion of charity connected with the distribution of the money of the\r\nrich among the needy, even in a corrupt manner. The comic writer who\r\ntells us that the whole system of corruption is to be considered as a\r\ncommerce of generosity on one side and of gratitude on the other, has\r\nrather exaggerated than misrepresented what really takes place in\r\nmany of these English constituent bodies where money is lavished to\r\nconciliate the favour and obtain the suffrages of the people. But in\r\nintimidation the whole process is an odious one. The whole feeling on\r\nthe part of the elector is that of shame, degradation, and hatred of the\r\nperson to whom he has given his vote. The elector is indeed placed in a\r\nworse situation than if he had no vote at all; for there is not one of\r\nus who would not rather be without a vote than be compelled to give it\r\nto the person whom he dislikes above all others.\r\n\r\nThinking, therefore, that the practice of intimidation has all the evils\r\nwhich are to be found in corruption, and that it has other evils which\r\nare not to be found in corruption, I was naturally led to consider\r\nwhether it was possible to prevent it by any process similar to that by\r\nwhich corruption is restrained. Corruption, you all know, is the subject\r\nof penal laws. If it is brought home to the parties, they are liable to\r\nsevere punishment. Although it is not often that it can be brought\r\nhome, yet there are instances. I remember several men of large property\r\nconfined in Newgate for corruption. Penalties have been awarded\r\nagainst offenders to the amount of five hundred pounds. Many members of\r\nParliament have been unseated on account of the malpractices of their\r\nagents. But you cannot, I am afraid, repress intimidation by penal laws.\r\nSuch laws would infringe the most sacred rights of property. How can I\r\nrequire a man to deal with tradesmen who have voted against him, or to\r\nrenew the leases of tenants who have voted against him? What is it that\r\nthe Jew says in the play?\r\n\r\n     \"I'll not answer that,\r\n     But say it is my humour.\"\r\n\r\nOr, as a Christian of our own time has expressed himself, \"I have a\r\nright to do what I will with my own.\" There is a great deal of weight\r\nin the reasoning of Shylock and the Duke of Newcastle. There would be\r\nan end of the right of property if you were to interdict a landlord\r\nfrom ejecting a tenant, if you were to force a gentleman to employ a\r\nparticular butcher, and to take as much beef this year as last year.\r\nThe principle of the right of property is that a man is not only to\r\nbe allowed to dispose of his wealth rationally and usefully, but to\r\nbe allowed to indulge his passions and caprices, to employ whatever\r\ntradesmen and labourers he chooses, and to let, or refuse to let, his\r\nland according to his own pleasure, without giving any reason or asking\r\nanybody's leave. I remember that, on one of the first evenings on which\r\nI sate in the House of Commons, Mr Poulett Thompson proposed a censure\r\non the Duke of Newcastle for His Grace's conduct towards the electors of\r\nNewark. Sir Robert Peel opposed the motion, not only with considerable\r\nability, but with really unanswerable reasons. He asked if it was meant\r\nthat a tenant who voted against his landlord was to keep his lease for\r\never. If so, tenants would vote against a landlord to secure themselves,\r\nas they now vote with a landlord to secure themselves. I thought, and\r\nthink, this argument unanswerable; but then it is unanswerable in favour\r\nof the ballot; for, if it be impossible to deal with intimidation by\r\npunishment, you are bound to consider whether there be any means of\r\nprevention; and the only mode of prevention that has ever been suggested\r\nis the ballot. That the ballot has disadvantages to be set off against\r\nits advantages, I admit; but it appears to me that we have only a choice\r\nof evils, and that the evils for which the ballot is a specific remedy\r\nare greater than any which the ballot is likely to produce. Observe with\r\nwhat exquisite accuracy the ballot draws the line of distinction between\r\nthe power which we ought to give to the proprietor and the power which\r\nwe ought not to give him. It leaves the proprietor the absolute power\r\nto do what he will with his own. Nobody calls upon him to say why he\r\nejected this tenant, or took away his custom from that tradesman. It\r\nleaves him at liberty to follow his own tastes, to follow his strangest\r\nwhims. The only thing which it puts beyond his power is the vote of the\r\ntenant, the vote of the tradesman, which it is our duty to protect. I\r\nought at the same time to say, that there is one objection to the\r\nballot of a very serious nature, but which I think may, nevertheless, be\r\nobviated. It is quite clear that, if the ballot shall be adopted, there\r\nwill be no remedy for an undue return by a subsequent scrutiny. Unless,\r\ntherefore, the registration of votes can be counted on as correct,\r\nthe ballot will undoubtedly lead to great inconvenience. It seems,\r\ntherefore, that a careful revision of the whole system of registration,\r\nand an improvement of the tribunal before which the rights of the\r\nelectors are to be established, should be an inseparable part of any\r\nmeasure by which the ballot is to be introduced.\r\n\r\nAs to those evils which we have been considering, they are evils which\r\nare practically felt; they are evils which press hard upon a large\r\nportion of the constituent body; and it is not therefore strange, that\r\nthe cry for a remedy should be loud and urgent. But there is another\r\nsubject respecting which I am told that many among you are anxious, a\r\nsubject of a very different description. I allude to the duration of\r\nParliaments.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that for some years past we have had little reason\r\nto complain of the length of Parliaments. Since the year 1830 we\r\nhave had five general elections; two occasioned by the deaths of two\r\nSovereigns, and three by political conjunctures. As to the present\r\nParliament, I do not think that, whatever opinion gentlemen may\r\nentertain of the conduct of that body, they will impute its faults to\r\nany confidence which the members have that they are to sit for seven\r\nyears; for I very much question whether there be one gentleman in the\r\nHouse of Commons who thinks, or has ever thought, that his seat is worth\r\nthree years' purchase. When, therefore, we discuss this question,\r\nwe must remember that we are discussing a question not immediately\r\npressing. I freely admit, however, that this is no reason for not fairly\r\nconsidering the subject: for it is the part of wise men to provide\r\nagainst evils which, though not actually felt, may be reasonably\r\napprehended. It seems to me that here, as in the case of the ballot,\r\nthere are serious considerations to be urged on both sides. The\r\nobjections to long Parliaments are perfectly obvious. The truth is that,\r\nin very long Parliaments, you have no representation at all. The mind\r\nof the people goes on changing; and the Parliament, remaining unchanged,\r\nceases to reflect the opinion of the constituent bodies. In the old\r\ntimes before the Revolution, a Parliament might sit during the life\r\nof the monarch. Parliaments were then sometimes of eighteen or twenty\r\nyears' duration. Thus the Parliament called by Charles the Second soon\r\nafter his return from exile, and elected when the nation was drunk with\r\nhope and convulsed by a hysterical paroxysm of loyalty, continued to sit\r\nlong after two-thirds of those who had heartily welcomed the King\r\nback from Holland as heartily wished him in Holland again. Since the\r\nRevolution we have not felt that evil to the same extent: but it must be\r\nadmitted that the term of seven years is too long. There are, however,\r\nother considerations to set off against this. There are two very serious\r\nevils connected with every general election: the first is, the violent\r\npolitical excitement: the second is, the ruinous expense. Both these\r\nevils were very greatly diminished by the Reform Act. Formerly these\r\nwere things which you in Scotland knew nothing about; but in England\r\nthe injury to the peace and morals of society resulting from a general\r\nelection was incalculable. During a fifteen days' poll in a town of one\r\nhundred thousand inhabitants, money was flowing in all directions; the\r\nstreets were running with beer; all business was suspended; and there\r\nwas nothing but disturbance and riot, and slander, and calumny, and\r\nquarrels, which left in the bosoms of private families heartburnings\r\nsuch as were not extinguished in the course of many years. By limiting\r\nthe duration of the poll, the Reform Act has conferred as great a\r\nblessing on the country,--and that is saying a bold word,--as by any\r\nother provision which it contains. Still it is not to be denied that\r\nthere are evils inseparable from that state of political excitement into\r\nwhich every community is thrown by the preparations for an election. A\r\nstill greater evil is the expense. That evil too has been diminished by\r\nthe operation of the Reform Act; but it still exists to a considerable\r\nextent. We do not now indeed hear of such elections as that of Yorkshire\r\nin 1807, or that of Northumberland in 1827. We do not hear of elections\r\nthat cost two hundred thousand pounds. But that the tenth part of that\r\nsum, nay, that the hundredth part of that sum should be expended in a\r\ncontest, is a great evil. Do not imagine, Gentlemen, that all this evil\r\nfalls on the candidates. It is on you that the evil falls. The effect\r\nmust necessarily be to limit you in your choice of able men to serve\r\nyou. The number of men who can advance fifty thousand pounds is\r\nnecessarily much smaller than the number of men who can advance five\r\nthousand pounds; the number of these again is much smaller than the\r\nnumber of those who can advance five hundred pounds; and the number of\r\nmen who can advance five hundred pounds every three years is necessarily\r\nsmaller than the number of those who can advance five hundred pounds\r\nevery seven years. Therefore it seems to me that the question is one of\r\ncomparison. In long Parliaments the representative character is in some\r\nmeasure effaced. On the other side, if you have short Parliaments, your\r\nchoice of men will be limited. Now in all questions of this sort, it\r\nis the part of wisdom to weigh, not indeed with minute accuracy,--for\r\nquestions of civil prudence cannot be subjected to an arithmetical\r\ntest,--but to weigh the advantages and disadvantages carefully, and then\r\nto strike the balance. Gentlemen will probably judge according to their\r\nhabits of mind, and according to their opportunities of observation.\r\nThose who have seen much of the evils of elections will probably incline\r\nto long Parliaments; those who have seen little or nothing of these\r\nevils will probably incline to a short term. Only observe this, that,\r\nwhatever may be the legal term, it ought to be a year longer than that\r\nfor which Parliaments ought ordinarily to sit. For there must be a\r\ngeneral election at the end of the legal term, let the state of the\r\ncountry be what it may. There may be riot; there may be revolution;\r\nthere may be famine in the country; and yet if the Minister wait to\r\nthe end of the legal term, the writs must go out. A wise Minister will\r\ntherefore always dissolve the Parliament a year before the end of the\r\nlegal term, if the country be then in a quiet state. It has now been\r\nlong the practice not to keep a Parliament more than six years. Thus\r\nthe Parliament which was elected in 1784 sat till 1790, six years;\r\nthe Parliament of 1790 till 1796, the Parliament of 1796 to 1802, the\r\nParliament of 1812 to 1818, and the Parliament of 1820 till 1826. If,\r\ntherefore, you wish the duration of Parliaments to be shortened to three\r\nyears, the proper course would be to fix the legal term at four years;\r\nand if you wish them to sit for four years, the proper course would be\r\nto fix the legal term at five years. My own inclination would be to fix\r\nthe legal term at five years, and thus to have a Parliament practically\r\nevery four years. I ought to add that, whenever any shortening of\r\nParliament takes place, we ought to alter that rule which requires that\r\nParliament shall be dissolved as often as the demise of the Crown takes\r\nplace. It is a rule for which no statesmanlike reason can be given; it\r\nis a mere technical rule; and it has already been so much relaxed that,\r\neven considered as a technical rule, it is absurd.\r\n\r\nI come now to another subject, of the highest and gravest importance:\r\nI mean the elective franchise; and I acknowledge that I am doubtful\r\nwhether my opinions on this subject may be so pleasing to many here\r\npresent as, if I may judge from your expressions, my sentiments on\r\nother subjects have been. I shall express my opinions, however, on this\r\nsubject as frankly as I have expressed them when they may have been more\r\npleasing. I shall express them with the frankness of a man who is more\r\ndesirous to gain your esteem than to gain your votes. I am for the\r\noriginal principle of the Reform Bill. I think that principle excellent;\r\nand I am sorry that we ever deviated from it. There were two deviations\r\nto which I was strongly opposed, and to which the authors of the bill,\r\nhard pressed by their opponents and feebly supported by their friends,\r\nvery unwillingly consented. One was the admission of the freemen to vote\r\nin towns: the other was the admission of the fifty pound tenants at will\r\nto vote in counties. At the same time I must say that I despair of being\r\nable to apply a direct remedy to either of these evils. The ballot might\r\nperhaps be an indirect remedy for the latter. I think that the system of\r\nregistration should be amended, that the clauses relating to the payment\r\nof rates should be altered, or altogether removed, and that the elective\r\nfranchise should be extended to every ten pound householder, whether\r\nhe resides within or without the limits of a town. To this extent I am\r\nprepared to go; but I should not be dealing with the ingenuousness which\r\nyou have a right to expect, if I did not tell you that I am not prepared\r\nto go further. There are many other questions as to which you are\r\nentitled to know the opinions of your representative: but I shall only\r\nglance rapidly at the most important. I have ever been a most determined\r\nenemy to the slave trade, and to personal slavery under every form. I\r\nhave always been a friend to popular education. I have always been a\r\nfriend to the right of free discussion. I have always been adverse to\r\nall restrictions on trade, and especially to those restrictions which\r\naffect the price of the necessaries of life. I have always been adverse\r\nto religious persecution, whether it takes the form of direct penal\r\nlaws, or of civil disabilities.\r\n\r\nNow, having said so much upon measures, I hope you will permit me to\r\nsay something about men. If you send me as your representative to\r\nParliament, I wish you to understand that I shall go there determined\r\nto support the present ministry. I shall do so not from any personal\r\ninterest or feeling. I have certainly the happiness to have several kind\r\nand much valued friends among the members of the Government; and there\r\nis one member of the Government, the noble President of the Council, to\r\nwhom I owe obligations which I shall always be proud to avow. That noble\r\nLord, when I was utterly unknown in public life, and scarcely known even\r\nto himself, placed me in the House of Commons; and it is due to him\r\nto say that he never in the least interfered with the freedom of my\r\nparliamentary conduct. I have since represented a great constituent\r\nbody, for whose confidence and kindness I can never be sufficiently\r\ngrateful, I mean the populous borough of Leeds. I may possibly by\r\nyour kindness be placed in the proud situation of Representative of\r\nEdinburgh; but I never could and never can be a more independent Member\r\nof the House of Commons than when I sat there as the nominee of Lord\r\nLansdowne. But, while I acknowledge my obligations to that noble person,\r\nwhile I avow the friendship which I feel for many of his colleagues,\r\nit is not on such grounds that I vindicate the support which it is my\r\nintention to give them. I have no right to sacrifice your interests to\r\nmy personal or private feelings: my principles do not permit me to do\r\nso; nor do my friends expect that I should do so. The support which I\r\npropose to give to the present Ministry I shall give on the following\r\ngrounds. I believe the present Ministry to be by many degrees the best\r\nMinistry which, in the present state of the country, can be formed.\r\nI believe that we have only one choice. I believe that our choice is\r\nbetween a Ministry substantially,--for of course I do not speak of\r\nparticular individuals,--between a Ministry substantially the same that\r\nwe have, and a Ministry under the direction of the Duke of Wellington\r\nand Sir Robert Peel. I do not hesitate to pronounce that my choice is in\r\nfavour of the former. Some gentleman appears to dissent from what I say.\r\nIf I knew what his objections are, I would try to remove them. But it\r\nis impossible to answer inarticulate noises. Is the objection that the\r\ngovernment is too conservative? Or is the objection that the government\r\nis too radical? If I understand rightly, the objection is that the\r\nGovernment does not proceed vigorously enough in the work of Reform. To\r\nthat objection then I will address myself. Now, I am far from denying\r\nthat the Ministers have committed faults. But, at the same time, I make\r\nallowances for the difficulties with which they are contending; and\r\nhaving made these allowances, I confidently say that, when I look back\r\nat the past, I think them entitled to praise, and that, looking forward\r\nto the future, I can pronounce with still more confidence that they are\r\nentitled to support.\r\n\r\nIt is a common error, and one which I have found among men, not only\r\nintelligent, but much conversant in public business, to think that in\r\npolitics, legislation is everything and administration nothing. Nothing\r\nis more usual than to hear people say, \"What! another session gone and\r\nnothing done; no new bills passed; the Irish Municipal Bill stopped in\r\nthe House of Lords. How could we be worse off if the Tories were in?\"\r\nMy answer is that, if the Tories were in, our legislation would be in as\r\nbad a state as at present, and we should have a bad administration into\r\nthe bargain. It seems strange to me that gentlemen should not be\r\naware that it may be better to have unreformed laws administered in a\r\nreforming spirit, than reformed laws administered in a spirit hostile to\r\nall reform. We often hear the maxim, \"Measures not men,\" and there is\r\na sense in which it is an excellent maxim. Measures not men, certainly:\r\nthat is, we are not to oppose Sir Robert Peel simply because he is Sir\r\nRobert Peel, or to support Lord John Russell simply because he is Lord\r\nJohn Russell. We are not to follow our political leaders in the way in\r\nwhich my honest Highland ancestors followed their chieftains. We are not\r\nto imitate that blind devotion which led all the Campbells to take the\r\nside of George the Second because the Duke of Argyle was a Whig, and\r\nall the Camerons to take the side of the Stuarts because Lochiel was a\r\nJacobite. But if you mean that, while the laws remain the same, it is\r\nunimportant by whom they are administered, then I say that a doctrine\r\nmore absurd was never uttered. Why, what are laws? They are mere words;\r\nthey are a dead letter; till a living agent comes to put life into them.\r\nThis is the case even in judicial matters. You can tie up the judges\r\nof the land much more closely than it would be right to tie up the\r\nSecretary for the Home Department or the Secretary for Foreign Affairs.\r\nYet is it immaterial whether the laws be administered by Chief Justice\r\nHale or Chief Justice Jeffreys? And can you doubt that the case is still\r\nstronger when you come to political questions? It would be perfectly\r\neasy, as many of you must be aware, to point out instances in which\r\nsociety has prospered under defective laws, well administered, and other\r\ninstances in which society has been miserable under institutions that\r\nlooked well on paper. But we need not go beyond our own country and our\r\nown times. Let us see what, within this island and in the present year,\r\na good administration has done to mitigate bad laws. For example, let us\r\ntake the law of libel. I hold the present state of our law of libel to\r\nbe a scandal to a civilised community. Nothing more absurd can be found\r\nin the whole history of jurisprudence. How the law of libel was abused\r\nformerly, you all know. You all know how it was abused under the\r\nadministrations of Lord North, of Mr Pitt, of Mr Perceval, of the\r\nEarl of Liverpool; and I am sorry to say that it was abused, most\r\nunjustifiably abused, by Lord Abinger under the administration of the\r\nDuke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel. Now is there any person who will\r\npretend to say that it has ever been abused by the Government of\r\nLord Melbourne? That Government has enemies in abundance; it has been\r\nattacked by Tory malcontents and by Radical malcontents; but has any one\r\nof them ever had the effrontery to say that it has abused the power of\r\nfiling ex officio informations for libel? Has this been from want of\r\nprovocation? On the contrary, the present Government has been libelled\r\nin a way in which no Government was ever libelled before. Has the law\r\nbeen altered? Has it been modified? Not at all. We have exactly the\r\nsame laws that we had when Mr Perry was brought to trial for saying that\r\nGeorge the Third was unpopular, Mr Leigh Hunt for saying that George the\r\nFourth was fat, and Sir Francis Burdett for expressing, not perhaps in\r\nthe best taste, a natural and honest indignation at the slaughter which\r\ntook place at Manchester in 1819. The law is precisely the same; but if\r\nit had been entirely remodelled, political writers could not have had\r\nmore liberty than they have enjoyed since Lord Melbourne came into\r\npower.\r\n\r\nI have given you an instance of the power of a good administration to\r\nmitigate a bad law. Now, see how necessary it is that there should be a\r\ngood administration to carry a good law into effect. An excellent bill\r\nwas brought into the House of Commons by Lord John Russell in 1828, and\r\npassed. To any other man than Lord John Russell the carrying of such\r\na bill would have been an enviable distinction indeed; but his name\r\nis identified with still greater reforms. It will, however, always be\r\naccounted one of his titles to public gratitude that he was the author\r\nof the law which repealed the Test Act. Well, a short time since, a\r\nnoble peer, the Lord Lieutenant of the county of Nottingham, thought fit\r\nto re-enact the Test Act, so far as that county was concerned. I have\r\nalready mentioned His Grace the Duke of Newcastle, and, to say truth,\r\nthere is no life richer in illustrations of all forms and branches of\r\nmisgovernment than his. His Grace very coolly informed Her Majesty's\r\nMinisters that he had not recommended a certain gentleman for the\r\ncommission of the peace because the gentleman was a Dissenter. Now here\r\nis a law which admits Dissenters to offices; and a Tory nobleman takes\r\nit on himself to rescind that law. But happily we have Whig Ministers.\r\nWhat did they do? Why, they put the Dissenter into the Commission; and\r\nthey turned the Tory nobleman out of the Lieutenancy. Do you seriously\r\nimagine that under a Tory administration this would have been done? I\r\nhave no wish to say anything disrespectful of the great Tory leaders.\r\nI shall always speak with respect of the great qualities and public\r\nservices of the Duke of Wellington: I have no other feeling about him\r\nthan one of pride that my country has produced so great a man; nor do\r\nI feel anything but respect and kindness for Sir Robert Peel, of whose\r\nabilities no person that has had to encounter him in debate will ever\r\nspeak slightingly. I do not imagine that those eminent men would have\r\napproved of the conduct of the Duke of Newcastle. I believe that the\r\nDuke of Wellington would as soon have thought of running away from the\r\nfield of battle as of doing the same thing in Hampshire, where he is\r\nLord Lieutenant. But do you believe that he would have turned the Duke\r\nof Newcastle out? I believe that he would not. As Mr Pulteney, a great\r\npolitical leader, said a hundred years since, \"The heads of parties are,\r\nlike the heads of snakes, carried on by the tails.\" It would have been\r\nutterly impossible for the Tory Ministers to have discarded the powerful\r\nTory Duke, unless they had at the same time resolved, like Mr Canning in\r\n1827, to throw themselves for support on the Whigs.\r\n\r\nNow I have given you these two instances to show that a change in the\r\nadministration may produce all the effects of a change in the law. You\r\nsee that to have a Tory Government is virtually to reenact the Test Act,\r\nand that to have a Whig Government is virtually to repeal the law of\r\nlibel. And if this is the case in England and Scotland, where society is\r\nin a sound state, how much more must it be the case in the diseased\r\npart of the empire, in Ireland? Ask any man there, whatever may be his\r\nreligion, whatever may be his politics, Churchman, Presbyterian, Roman\r\nCatholic, Repealer, Precursor, Orangeman, ask Mr O'Connell, ask Colonel\r\nConolly, whether it is a slight matter in whose hands the executive\r\npower is lodged. Every Irishman will tell you that it is a matter of\r\nlife and death; that in fact more depends upon the men than upon the\r\nlaws. It disgusts me therefore to hear men of liberal politics say,\r\n\"What is the use of a Whig Government? The Ministers can do nothing for\r\nthe country. They have been four years at work on an Irish Municipal\r\nBill, without being able to pass it through the Lords.\" Would any ten\r\nActs of Parliament make such a difference to Ireland as the difference\r\nbetween having Lord Ebrington for Lord Lieutenant, with Lord Morpeth\r\nfor Secretary, and having the Earl of Roden for Lord Lieutenant, with Mr\r\nLefroy for Secretary? Ask the popular Irish leaders whether they\r\nwould like better to remain as they are, with Lord Ebrington as Lord\r\nLieutenant, or to have the Municipal Bill, and any other three bills\r\nwhich they might name, with Lord Roden for Viceroy; and they will at\r\nonce answer, \"Leave us Lord Ebrington; and burn your bills.\" The truth\r\nis that, the more defective the legislation, the more important is a\r\ngood administration, just as the personal qualities of the Sovereign are\r\nof more importance in despotic countries like Russia than in a limited\r\nmonarchy. If we have not in our Statute Book all the securities\r\nnecessary for good government, it is of the more importance that\r\nthe character of the men who administer the government should be an\r\nadditional security.\r\n\r\nBut we are told that the Government is weak. That is most true; and I\r\nbelieve that almost all that we are tempted to blame in the conduct of\r\nthe Government is to be attributed to weakness. But let us consider what\r\nthe nature of this weakness is. Is it that kind of weakness which makes\r\nit our duty to oppose the Government? Or is it that kind of weakness\r\nwhich makes it our duty to support the Government? Is it intellectual\r\nweakness, moral weakness, the incapacity to discern, or the want\r\nof courage to pursue, the true interest of the nation? Such was the\r\nweakness of Mr Addington, when this country was threatened with invasion\r\nfrom Boulogne. Such was the weakness of the Government which sent out\r\nthe wretched Walcheren expedition, and starved the Duke of Wellington in\r\nSpain; a government whose only strength was shown in prosecuting writers\r\nwho exposed abuses, and in slaughtering rioters whom oppression had\r\ndriven into outrage. Is that the weakness of the present Government? I\r\nthink not. As compared with any other party capable of holding the reins\r\nof Government, they are deficient neither in intellectual nor in moral\r\nstrength. On all great questions of difference between the Ministers and\r\nthe Opposition, I hold the Ministers to be in the right. When I consider\r\nthe difficulties with which they have to struggle, when I see how\r\nmanfully that struggle is maintained by Lord Melbourne, when I see that\r\nLord John Russell has excited even the admiration of his opponents by\r\nthe heroic manner in which he has gone on, year after year, in sickness\r\nand domestic sorrow, fighting the battle of Reform, I am led to the\r\nconclusion that the weakness of the Ministers is of that sort which\r\nmakes it our duty to give them, not opposition, but support; and that\r\nsupport it is my purpose to afford to the best of my ability.\r\n\r\nIf, indeed, I thought myself at liberty to consult my own inclination,\r\nI should have stood aloof from the conflict. If you should be pleased\r\nto send me to Parliament, I shall enter an assembly very different\r\nfrom that which I quitted in 1834. I left the Wigs united and dominant,\r\nstrong in the confidence and attachment of one House of Parliament,\r\nstrong also in the fears of the other. I shall return to find them\r\nhelpless in the Lords, and forced almost every week to fight a battle\r\nfor existence in the Commons. Many, whom I left bound together by what\r\nseemed indissoluble private and public ties, I shall now find assailing\r\neach other with more than the ordinary bitterness of political\r\nhostility. Many with whom I sate side by side, contending through whole\r\nnights for the Reform Bill, till the sun broke over the Thames on our\r\nundiminished ranks, I shall now find on hostile benches. I shall be\r\ncompelled to engage in painful altercations with many with whom I had\r\nhoped never to have a conflict, except in the generous and friendly\r\nstrife which should best serve the common cause. I left the Liberal\r\nGovernment strong enough to maintain itself against an adverse Court; I\r\nsee that the Liberal Government now rests for support on the preference\r\nof a Sovereign, in whom the country sees with delight the promise of a\r\nbetter, a gentler, a happier Elizabeth, of a Sovereign in whom we hope\r\nthat our children and our grandchildren will admire the firmness, the\r\nsagacity, and the spirit which distinguished the last and greatest of\r\nthe Tudors, tempered by the beneficent influence of more humane times\r\nand more popular institutions. Whether royal favour, never more needed\r\nand never better deserved, will enable the government to surmount the\r\ndifficulties with which it has to deal, I cannot presume to judge. It\r\nmay be that the blow has only been deferred for a season, and that a\r\nlong period of Tory domination is before us. Be it so. I entered public\r\nlife a Whig; and a Whig I am determined to remain. I use that word, and\r\nI wish you to understand that I use it, in no narrow sense. I mean by\r\na Whig, not one who subscribes implicitly to the contents of any book,\r\nthough that book may have been written by Locke; not one who approves\r\nthe whole conduct of any statesman, though that statesman may have been\r\nFox; not one who adopts the opinions in fashion in any circle, though\r\nthat circle may be composed of the finest and noblest spirits of the\r\nage. But it seems to me that, when I look back on our history, I can\r\ndiscern a great party which has, through many generations, preserved its\r\nidentity; a party often depressed, never extinguished; a party which,\r\nthough often tainted with the faults of the age, has always been in\r\nadvance of the age; a party which, though guilty of many errors and\r\nsome crimes, has the glory of having established our civil and religious\r\nliberties on a firm foundation; and of that party I am proud to be a\r\nmember. It was that party which, on the great question of monopolies,\r\nstood up against Elizabeth. It was that party which, in the reign of\r\nJames the First, organised the earliest parliamentary opposition, which\r\nsteadily asserted the privileges of the people, and wrested prerogative\r\nafter prerogative from the Crown. It was that party which forced\r\nCharles the First to relinquish the ship-money. It was that party which\r\ndestroyed the Star Chamber and the High Commission Court. It was that\r\nparty which, under Charles the Second, carried the Habeas Corpus Act,\r\nwhich effected the Revolution, which passed the Toleration Act, which\r\nbroke the yoke of a foreign church in your country, and which saved\r\nScotland from the fate of unhappy Ireland. It was that party which\r\nreared and maintained the constitutional throne of Hanover against the\r\nhostility of the Church and of the landed aristocracy of England. It\r\nwas that party which opposed the war with America and the war with the\r\nFrench Republic; which imparted the blessings of our free Constitution\r\nto the Dissenters; and which, at a later period, by unparalleled\r\nsacrifices and exertions, extended the same blessings to the Roman\r\nCatholics. To the Whigs of the seventeenth century we owe it that we\r\nhave a House of Commons. To the Whigs of the nineteenth century we owe\r\nit that the House of Commons has been purified. The abolition of the\r\nslave trade, the abolition of colonial slavery, the extension of popular\r\neducation, the mitigation of the rigour of the penal code, all, all were\r\neffected by that party; and of that party, I repeat, I am a member. I\r\nlook with pride on all that the Whigs have done for the cause of human\r\nfreedom and of human happiness. I see them now hard pressed, struggling\r\nwith difficulties, but still fighting the good fight. At their head I\r\nsee men who have inherited the spirit and the virtues, as well as the\r\nblood, of old champions and martyrs of freedom. To those men I propose\r\nto attach myself. Delusion may triumph: but the triumphs of delusion are\r\nbut for a day. We may be defeated: but our principles will only gather\r\nfresh strength from defeats. Be that, however, as it may, my part is\r\ntaken. While one shred of the old banner is flying, by that banner will\r\nI at least be found. The good old cause, as Sidney called it on the\r\nscaffold, vanquished or victorious, insulted or triumphant, the good\r\nold cause is still the good old cause with me. Whether in or out of\r\nParliament, whether speaking with that authority which must always\r\nbelong to the representative of this great and enlightened community,\r\nor expressing the humble sentiments of a private citizen, I will to the\r\nlast maintain inviolate my fidelity to principles which, though they may\r\nbe borne down for a time by senseless clamour, are yet strong with the\r\nstrength and immortal with the immortality of truth, and which, however\r\nthey may be misunderstood or misrepresented by contemporaries, will\r\nassuredly find justice from a better age. Gentlemen, I have done. I have\r\nonly to thank you for the kind attention with which you have heard me,\r\nand to express my hope that whether my principles have met with your\r\nconcurrence or not, the frankness with which I have expressed them will\r\nat least obtain your approbation.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONFIDENCE IN THE MINISTRY OF LORD MELBOURNE. (JANUARY 29, 1840) A\r\nSPEECH DELIVERED IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS ON THE 29TH OF JANUARY 1840.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-eighth of January 1840, Sir John Yarde Buller moved the\r\nfollowing resolution:\r\n\r\n\"That Her Majesty's Government, as at present constituted, does not\r\npossess the confidence of the House.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a discussion of four nights the motion was rejected by 308 votes\r\nto 287. The following Speech was made on the second night of the debate.\r\n\r\nThe House, Sir, may possibly imagine that I rise under some little\r\nfeeling of irritation to reply to the personal reflections which have\r\nbeen introduced into the discussion. It would be easy to reply to these\r\nreflections. It would be still easier to retort them: but I should\r\nthink either course unworthy of me and of this great occasion. If ever\r\nI should so far forget myself as to wander from the subject of debate to\r\nmatters concerning only myself, it will not, I hope, be at a time when\r\nthe dearest interests of our country are staked on the result of our\r\ndeliberations. I rise under feelings of anxiety which leave no room in\r\nmy mind for selfish vanity or petty vindictiveness. I believe with the\r\nmost intense conviction that, in pleading for the Government to which\r\nI belong, I am pleading for the safety of the Commonwealth, for the\r\nreformation of abuses, and at the same time for the preservation of\r\naugust and venerable institutions: and I trust, Mr Speaker, that when\r\nthe question is whether a Cabinet be or be not worthy of the confidence\r\nof Parliament, the first Member of that Cabinet who comes forward to\r\ndefend himself and his colleagues will find here some portion of that\r\ngenerosity and good feeling which once distinguished English gentlemen.\r\nBut be this as it may, my voice shall be heard. I repeat, that I am\r\npleading at once for the reformation and for the preservation of our\r\ninstitutions, for liberty and order, for justice administered in mercy,\r\nfor equal laws, for the rights of conscience, and for the real union of\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland. If, on so grave an occasion, I should advert\r\nto one or two of the charges which have been brought against myself\r\npersonally, I shall do so only because I conceive that those charges\r\naffect in some degree the character of the Government to which I belong.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief accusations brought against the Government by the\r\nhonourable Baronet (Sir John Yarde Buller.) who opened the debate,\r\nand repeated by the seconder (Alderman Thompson.), and by almost every\r\ngentlemen who has addressed the House from the benches opposite, is that\r\nI have been invited to take office though my opinion with respect to the\r\nBallot is known to be different from that of my colleagues. We have been\r\nrepeatedly told that a Ministry in which there is not perfect unanimity\r\non a subject so important must be undeserving of the public confidence.\r\nNow, Sir, it is true that I am in favour of secret voting, that my noble\r\nand right honourable friends near me are in favour of open voting,\r\nand yet that we sit in the same Cabinet. But if, on account of this\r\ndifference of opinion, the Government is unworthy of public confidence,\r\nthen I am sure that scarcely any government which has existed within the\r\nmemory of the oldest man has been deserving of public confidence. It\r\nis well-known that in the Cabinets of Mr Pitt, of Mr Fox, of Lord\r\nLiverpool, of Mr Canning, of the Duke of Wellington, there were\r\nopen questions of great moment. Mr Pitt, while still zealous for\r\nparliamentary reform, brought into the Cabinet Lord Grenville, who\r\nwas adverse to parliamentary reform. Again, Mr Pitt, while eloquently\r\nsupporting the abolition of the Slave Trade, brought into the Cabinet\r\nMr Dundas, who was the chief defender of the Slave Trade. Mr Fox,\r\ntoo, intense as was his abhorrence of the Slave Trade, sat in the same\r\nCabinet with Lord Sidmouth and Mr Windham, who voted to the last against\r\nthe abolition of that trade. Lord Liverpool, Mr Canning, the Duke of\r\nWellington, all left the question of Catholic Emancipation open. And\r\nyet, of all questions, that was perhaps the very last that should have\r\nbeen left open. For it was not merely a legislative question, but a\r\nquestion which affected every part of the executive administration.\r\nBut, to come to the present time, suppose that you could carry your\r\nresolution, suppose that you could drive the present Ministers from\r\npower, who that may succeed them will be able to form a government in\r\nwhich there will be no open questions? Can the right honourable Baronet\r\nthe member for Tamworth (Sir Robert Peel.) form a Cabinet without\r\nleaving the great question of our privileges open? In what respect is\r\nthat question less important than the question of the Ballot? Is it not\r\nindeed from the privileges of the House that all questions relating\r\nto the constitution of the House derive their importance? What does it\r\nmatter how we are chosen, if, when we meet, we do not possess the\r\npowers necessary to enable us to perform the functions of a legislative\r\nassembly? Yet you who would turn out the present Ministers because they\r\ndiffer from each other as to the way in which Members of this House\r\nshould be chosen, wish to bring in men who decidedly differ from each\r\nother as to the relation in which this House stands to the nation, to\r\nthe other House, and to the Courts of Judicature. Will you say that the\r\ndispute between the House and the Court of Queen's Bench is a trifling\r\ndispute? Surely, in the late debates, you were all perfectly agreed as\r\nto the importance of the question, though you were agreed as to nothing\r\nelse. Some of you told us that we were contending for a power essential\r\nto our honour and usefulness. Many of you protested against our\r\nproceedings, and declared that we were encroaching on the province of\r\nthe tribunals, violating the liberty of our fellow citizens, punishing\r\nhonest magistrates for not perjuring themselves. Are these trifles? And\r\ncan we believe that you really feel a horror of open questions when we\r\nsee your Prime Minister elect sending people to prison overnight,\r\nand his law officers elect respectfully attending the levee of those\r\nprisoners the next morning? Observe, too, that this question of\r\nprivileges is not merely important; it is also pressing. Something must\r\nbe done, and that speedily. My belief is that more inconvenience would\r\nfollow from leaving that question open one month than from leaving the\r\nquestion of the Ballot open ten years.\r\n\r\nThe Ballot, Sir, is not the only subject on which I am accused of\r\nholding dangerous opinions. The right honourable Baronet the Member\r\nfor Pembroke (Sir James Graham.) pronounces the present Government\r\na Chartist Government; and he proves his point by saying that I am a\r\nmember of the government, and that I wish to give the elective franchise\r\nto every ten pound householder, whether his house be in a town or in\r\nthe country. Is it possible, Sir, that the honourable Baronet should not\r\nknow that the fundamental principle of the plan of government called the\r\nPeople's Charter is that every male of twenty-one should have a vote?\r\nOr is it possible that he can see no difference between giving the\r\nfranchise to all ten pound householders, and giving the franchise to all\r\nmales of twenty-one? Does he think the ten pound householders a class\r\nmorally or intellectually unfit to possess the franchise, he who bore a\r\nchief part in framing the law which gave them the franchise in all the\r\nrepresented towns of the United Kingdom? Or will he say that the ten\r\npound householder in a town is morally and intellectually fit to be\r\nan elector, but that the ten pound householder who lives in the\r\nopen country is morally and intellectually unfit? Is not house-rent\r\nnotoriously higher in towns than in the country? Is it not, therefore,\r\nprobable that the occupant of a ten pound house in a rural hamlet will\r\nbe a man who has a greater stake in the peace and welfare of society\r\nthan a man who has a ten pound house in Manchester or Birmingham? Can\r\nyou defend on conservative principles an arrangement which gives votes\r\nto a poorer class and withholds them from a richer? For my own part, I\r\nbelieve it to be essential to the welfare of the state, that the elector\r\nshould have a pecuniary qualification. I believe that the ten pound\r\nqualification cannot be proved to be either too high or too low.\r\nChanges, which may hereafter take place in the value of money and in\r\nthe condition of the people, may make a change of the qualification\r\nnecessary. But the ten pound qualification is, I believe, well suited to\r\nthe present state of things. At any rate, I am unable to conceive why it\r\nshould be a sufficient qualification within the limits of a borough, and\r\nan insufficient qualification a yard beyond those limits; sufficient at\r\nKnightsbridge, but insufficient at Kensington; sufficient at Lambeth,\r\nbut insufficient at Battersea? If any person calls this Chartism, he\r\nmust permit me to tell him that he does not know what Chartism is.\r\n\r\nA motion, Sir, such as that which we are considering, brings under our\r\nreview the whole policy of the kingdom, domestic, foreign, and colonial.\r\nIt is not strange, therefore, that there should have been several\r\nepisodes in this debate. Something has been said about the hostilities\r\non the River Plata, something about the hostilities on the coast of\r\nChina, something about Commissioner Lin, something about Captain Elliot.\r\nBut on such points I shall not dwell, for it is evidently not by the\r\nopinion which the House may entertain on such points that the event\r\nof the debate will be decided. The main argument of the gentlemen who\r\nsupport the motion, the argument on which the right honourable Baronet\r\nwho opened the debate chiefly relied, the argument which his seconder\r\nrepeated, and which has formed the substance of every speech since\r\ndelivered from the opposite side of the House, may be fairly summed\r\nup thus, \"The country is not in a satisfactory state. There is much\r\nrecklessness, much turbulence, much craving for political change; and\r\nthe cause of these evils is the policy of the Whigs. They rose to power\r\nby agitation in 1830: they retained power by means of agitation through\r\nthe tempestuous months which followed: they carried the Reform Bill\r\nby means of agitation: expelled from office, they forced themselves in\r\nagain by means of agitation; and now we are paying the penalty of their\r\nmisconduct. Chartism is the natural offspring of Whiggism. From those\r\nwho caused the evil we cannot expect the remedy. The first thing to\r\nbe done is to dismiss them, and to call to power men who, not having\r\ninstigated the people to commit excesses, can, without incurring the\r\ncharge of inconsistency, enforce the laws.\"\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, it seems to me that this argument was completely refuted by\r\nthe able and eloquent speech of my right honourable friend the Judge\r\nAdvocate. (Sir George Grey.) He said, and he said most truly, that those\r\nwho hold this language are really accusing, not the Government of Lord\r\nMelbourne, but the Government of Lord Grey. I was therefore, I must say,\r\nsurprised, after the speech of my right honourable friend, to hear\r\nthe right honourable Baronet the Member for Pembroke, himself a\r\ndistinguished member of the cabinet of Lord Grey, pronounce a harangue\r\nagainst agitation. That he was himself an agitator he does not venture\r\nto deny; but he tries to excuse himself by saying, \"I liked the Reform\r\nBill; I thought it a good bill; and so I agitated for it; and, in\r\nagitating for it, I acknowledge that I went to the very utmost limit of\r\nwhat was prudent, to the very utmost limit of what was legal.\" Does not\r\nthe right honourable Baronet perceive that, by setting up this defence\r\nfor his own past conduct, he admits that agitation is good or evil,\r\naccording as the objects of the agitation are good or evil? When I hear\r\nhim speak of agitation as a practice disgraceful to a public man, and\r\nespecially to a Minister of the Crown, and address his lecture in a\r\nparticular manner to me, I cannot but wonder that he should not perceive\r\nthat his reproaches, instead of wounding me, recoil on himself. I was\r\nnot a member of the Cabinet which brought in the Reform Bill, which\r\ndissolved the Parliament in a moment of intense excitement in order\r\nto carry the Reform Bill, which refused to serve the Sovereign longer\r\nunless he would create peers in sufficient numbers to carry the Reform\r\nBill. I was at that time only one of those hundreds of members of this\r\nHouse, one of those millions of Englishmen, who were deeply impressed\r\nwith the conviction that the Reform Bill was one of the best laws\r\nthat ever had been framed, and who reposed entire confidence in the\r\nabilities, the integrity, and the patriotism of the ministers; and\r\nI must add that in no member of the administration did I place more\r\nconfidence than in the right honourable Baronet, who was then First\r\nLord of the Admiralty, and in the noble lord who was then Secretary for\r\nIreland. (Lord Stanley.) It was indeed impossible for me not to see that\r\nthe public mind was strongly, was dangerously stirred: but I trusted\r\nthat men so able, men so upright, men who had so large a stake in the\r\ncountry, would carry us safe through the storm which they had raised.\r\nAnd is it not rather hard that my confidence in the right honourable\r\nBaronet and the noble lord is to be imputed to me as a crime by the very\r\nmen who are trying to raise the right honourable Baronet and the noble\r\nlord to power? The Charter, we have been told in this debate, is the\r\nchild of the Reform Bill. But whose child is the Reform Bill? If men are\r\nto be deemed unfit for office because they roused the national spirit\r\nto support that bill, because they went as far as the law permitted in\r\norder to carry that bill, then I say that no men can be more unfit for\r\noffice than the right honourable Baronet and the noble lord. It may be\r\nthought presumptuous in me to defend two persons who are so well able to\r\ndefend themselves, and the more so, as they have a powerful ally in\r\nthe right honourable Baronet the Member for Tamworth, who, having twice\r\noffered them high places in the Government, must be supposed to be of\r\nopinion that they are not disqualified for being ministers by having\r\nbeen agitators. I will, however, venture to offer some arguments in\r\nvindication of the conduct of my noble and right honourable friends,\r\nas I once called them, and as, notwithstanding the asperity which\r\nhas characterised the present debate, I should still have pleasure in\r\ncalling them. I would say in their behalf that agitation ought not to be\r\nindiscriminately condemned; that great abuses ought to be removed;\r\nthat in this country scarcely any great abuse was ever removed till the\r\npublic feeling had been roused against it; and that the public feeling\r\nhas seldom been roused against abuses without exertions to which the\r\nname of agitation may be given. I altogether deny the assertion which\r\nwe have repeatedly heard in the course of this debate, that a government\r\nwhich does not discountenance agitation cannot be trusted to suppress\r\nrebellion. Agitation and rebellion, you say, are in kind the same thing:\r\nthey differ only in degree. Sir, they are the same thing in the sense\r\nin which to breathe a vein and to cut a throat are the same thing. There\r\nare many points of resemblance between the act of the surgeon and the\r\nact of the assassin. In both there is the steel, the incision, the\r\nsmart, the bloodshed. But the acts differ as widely as possible both in\r\nmoral character and in physical effect. So with agitation and rebellion.\r\nI do not believe that there has been any moment since the revolution\r\nof 1688 at which an insurrection in this country would have been\r\njustifiable. On the other hand, I hold that we have owed to agitation a\r\nlong series of beneficent reforms which could have been effected in no\r\nother way. Nor do I understand how any person can reprobate agitation,\r\nmerely as agitation, unless he is prepared to adopt the maxim of Bishop\r\nHorsley, that the people have nothing to do with the laws but to\r\nobey them. The truth is that agitation is inseparable from popular\r\ngovernment. If you wish to get rid of agitation, you must establish an\r\noligarchy like that of Venice, or a despotism like that of Russia. If\r\na Russian thinks that he is able to suggest an improvement in the\r\ncommercial code or the criminal code of his country, he tries to obtain\r\nan audience of the Emperor Nicholas or of Count Nesselrode. If he\r\ncan satisfy them that his plans are good, then undoubtedly, without\r\nagitation, without controversy in newspapers, without harangues from\r\nhustings, without clamorous meetings in great halls and in marketplaces,\r\nwithout petitions signed by tens of thousands, you may have a reform\r\neffected with one stroke of the pen. Not so here. Here the people, as\r\nelectors, have power to decide questions of the highest importance. And\r\nought they not to hear and read before they decide? And how can they\r\nhear if nobody speaks, or read if nobody writes? You must admit,\r\nthen, that it is our right, and that it may be our duty, to attempt\r\nby speaking and writing to induce the great body of our countrymen to\r\npronounce what we think a right decision; and what else is agitation? In\r\nsaying this I am not defending one party alone. Has there been no Tory\r\nagitation? No agitation against Popery? No agitation against the new\r\nPoor Law? No agitation against the plan of education framed by the\r\npresent Government? Or, to pass from questions about which we differ to\r\nquestions about which we all agree: Would the slave trade ever have\r\nbeen abolished without agitation? Would slavery ever have been abolished\r\nwithout agitation? Would your prison discipline ever have been improved\r\nwithout agitation? Would your penal code, once the scandal of the\r\nStatute Book, have been mitigated without agitation? I am far from\r\ndenying that agitation may be abused, may be employed for bad ends, may\r\nbe carried to unjustifiable lengths. So may that freedom of speech\r\nwhich is one of the most precious privileges of this House. Indeed,\r\nthe analogy is very close. What is agitation but the mode in which the\r\npublic, the body which we represent, the great outer assembly, if I may\r\nso speak, holds its debates? It is as necessary to the good government\r\nof the country that our constituents should debate as that we should\r\ndebate. They sometimes go wrong, as we sometimes go wrong. There\r\nis often much exaggeration, much unfairness, much acrimony in their\r\ndebates. Is there none in ours? Some worthless demagogues may have\r\nexhorted the people to resist the laws. But what member of Lord Grey's\r\nGovernment, what member of the present Government, ever gave any\r\ncountenance to any illegal proceedings? It is perfectly true that some\r\nwords which have been uttered here and in other places, and which, when\r\ntaken together with the context and candidly construed, will appear to\r\nmean nothing but what was reasonable and constitutional and moderate,\r\nhave been distorted and mutilated into something that has a seditious\r\naspect. But who is secure against such misrepresentation? Not, I am\r\nsure, the right honourable Baronet the Member for Pembroke. He ought to\r\nremember that his own speeches have been used by bad men for bad ends.\r\nHe ought to remember that some expressions which he used in 1830, on\r\nthe subject of the emoluments divided among Privy Councillors, have been\r\nquoted by the Chartists in vindication of their excesses. Do I blame him\r\nfor this? Not at all. He said nothing that was not justifiable. But it\r\nis impossible for a man so to guard his lips that his language shall not\r\nsometimes be misunderstood by dull men, and sometimes misrepresented\r\nby dishonest men. I do not, I say, blame him for having used those\r\nexpressions: but I do say that, knowing how his own expressions had been\r\nperverted, he should have hesitated before he threw upon men, not\r\nless attached than himself to the cause of law, of order and property,\r\nimputations certainly not better founded than those to which he is\r\nhimself liable.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Sir, to pass by many topics to which, but for the lateness of\r\nthe hour, I would willingly advert, let me remind the House that\r\nthe question before us is not a positive question, but a question of\r\ncomparison. No man, though he may disapprove of some part of the conduct\r\nof the present Ministers, is justified in voting for the motion which we\r\nare considering, unless he believes that a change would, on the whole,\r\nbe beneficial. No government is perfect: but some government there must\r\nbe; and if the present government were worse than its enemies think it,\r\nit ought to exist until it can be succeeded by a better. Now I take it\r\nto be perfectly clear that, in the event of the removal of Her Majesty's\r\npresent advisers, an administration must be formed of which the right\r\nhonourable Baronet the Member for Tamworth will be the head. Towards\r\nthat right honourable Baronet, and towards many of the noblemen and\r\ngentlemen who would probably in that event be associated with him, I\r\nentertain none but kind and respectful feelings. I am far, I hope, from\r\nthat narrowness of mind which makes a man unable to see merit in any\r\nparty but his own. If I may venture to parody the old Venetian proverb,\r\nI would be \"First an Englishman; and then a Whig.\" I feel proud of my\r\ncountry when I think how much ability, uprightness, and patriotism may\r\nbe found on both sides of the House. Among our opponents stands forth,\r\neminently distinguished by parts, eloquence, knowledge, and, I willingly\r\nadmit, by public spirit, the right honourable Baronet the Member for\r\nTamworth. Having said this, I shall offer no apology for the remarks\r\nwhich, in the discharge of my public duty, I shall make, without, I\r\nhope, any personal discourtesy, on his past conduct, and his present\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nIt has been, Sir, I will not say his fault, but his misfortune, his\r\nfate, to be the leader of a party with which he has no sympathy. To go\r\nback to what is now matter of history, the right honourable Baronet\r\nbore a chief part in the restoration of the currency. By a very\r\nlarge proportion of his followers the restoration of the currency is\r\nconsidered as the chief cause of the distresses of the country. The\r\nright honourable Baronet cordially supported the commercial policy of Mr\r\nHuskisson. But there was no name more odious than that of Mr Huskisson\r\nto the rank and file of the Tory party. The right honourable Baronet\r\nassented to the Act which removed the disabilities of the Protestant\r\nDissenters. But, a very short time ago, a noble Duke, one of the\r\nhighest in power and rank of the right honourable Baronet's adherents,\r\npositively refused to lend his aid to the executing of that Act.\r\nThe right honourable Baronet brought in the bill which removed the\r\ndisabilities of the Roman Catholics: but his supporters make it a chief\r\narticle of charge against us that we have given practical effect to\r\nthe law which is his best title to public esteem. The right honourable\r\nBaronet has declared himself decidedly favourable to the new Poor Law.\r\nYet, if a voice is raised against the Whig Bastilles and the Kings of\r\nSomerset House, it is almost certain to be the voice of some zealous\r\nretainer of the right honourable Baronet. On the great question of\r\nprivilege, the right honourable Baronet has taken a part which entitles\r\nhim to the gratitude of all who are solicitous for the honour and the\r\nusefulness of the popular branch of the legislature. But if any person\r\ncalls us tyrants, and calls those whom we have imprisoned martyrs, that\r\nperson is certain to be a partisan of the right honourable Baronet.\r\nEven when the right honourable Baronet does happen to agree with his\r\nfollowers as to a conclusion, he seldom arrives at that conclusion by\r\nthe same process of reasoning which satisfies them. Many great questions\r\nwhich they consider as questions of right and wrong, as questions of\r\nmoral and religious principle, as questions which must, for no earthly\r\nobject, and on no emergency, be compromised, are treated by him merely\r\nas questions of expediency, of place, and of time. He has opposed many\r\nbills introduced by the present Government; but he has opposed them on\r\nsuch grounds that he is at perfect liberty to bring in the same bills\r\nhimself next year, with perhaps some slight variation. I listened to him\r\nas I always listen to him, with pleasure, when he spoke last session on\r\nthe subject of education. I could not but be amused by the skill with\r\nwhich he performed the hard task of translating the gibberish of bigots\r\ninto language which might not misbecome the mouth of a man of sense. I\r\nfelt certain that he despised the prejudices of which he condescended\r\nto make use, and that his opinion about the Normal Schools and the Douai\r\nVersion entirely agreed with my own. I therefore do not think that,\r\nin times like these, the right honourable Baronet can conduct the\r\nadministration with honour to himself or with satisfaction to those\r\nwho are impatient to see him in office. I will not affect to feel\r\napprehensions from which I am entirely free. I do not fear, and I will\r\nnot pretend to fear, that the right honourable Baronet will be a tyrant\r\nand a persecutor. I do not believe that he will give up Ireland to the\r\ntender mercies of those zealots who form, I am afraid, the strongest,\r\nand I am sure the loudest, part of his retinue. I do not believe that\r\nhe will strike the names of Roman Catholics from the Privy Council book,\r\nand from the Commissions of the Peace. I do not believe that he will\r\nlay on our table a bill for the repeal of that great Act which was\r\nintroduced by himself in 1829. What I do anticipate is this, that he\r\nwill attempt to keep his party together by means which will excite\r\ngrave discontents, and yet that he will not succeed in keeping his party\r\ntogether; that he will lose the support of the Tories without obtaining\r\nthe support of the nation; and that his government will fall from causes\r\npurely internal.\r\n\r\nThis, Sir, is not mere conjecture. The drama is not a new one. It was\r\nperformed a few years ago on the same stage and by most of the same\r\nactors. In 1827 the right honourable Baronet was, as now, the head of\r\na powerful Tory opposition. He had, as now, the support of a strong\r\nminority in this House. He had, as now, a majority in the other House.\r\nHe was, as now, the favourite of the Church and of the Universities. All\r\nwho dreaded political change, all who hated religious liberty, rallied\r\nround him then, as they rally round him now. Their cry was then, as\r\nnow, that a government unfriendly to the civil and ecclesiastical\r\nconstitution of the realm was kept in power by intrigue and court\r\nfavour, and that the right honourable Baronet was the man to whom the\r\nnation must look to defend its laws against revolutionists, and its\r\nreligion against idolaters. At length that cry became irresistible.\r\nTory animosity had pursued the most accomplished of Tory statesmen and\r\norators to a resting place in Westminster Abbey. The arrangement which\r\nwas made after his death lasted but a very few months: a Tory government\r\nwas formed; and the right honourable Baronet became the leading minister\r\nof the Crown in the House of Commons. His adherents hailed his elevation\r\nwith clamorous delight, and confidently expected many years of triumph\r\nand dominion. Is it necessary to say in what disappointment, in what\r\nsorrow, in what fury, those expectations ended? The right honourable\r\nBaronet had been raised to power by prejudices and passions in which\r\nhe had no share. His followers were bigots. He was a statesman. He was\r\ncoolly weighing conveniences against inconveniences, while they were\r\nready to resort to a proscription and to hazard a civil war rather than\r\ndepart from what they called their principles. For a time he tried to\r\ntake a middle course. He imagined that it might be possible for him to\r\nstand well with his old friends, and yet to perform some part of his\r\nduty to the state. But those were not times in which he could long\r\ncontinue to halt between two opinions. His elevation, as it had excited\r\nthe hopes of the oppressors, had excited also the terror and the rage of\r\nthe oppressed. Agitation, which had, during more than a year, slumbered\r\nin Ireland, awoke with renewed vigour, and soon became more formidable\r\nthan ever. The Roman Catholic Association began to exercise authority\r\nsuch as the Irish Parliament, in the days of its independence, had never\r\npossessed. An agitator became more powerful than the Lord Lieutenant.\r\nViolence engendered violence. Every explosion of feeling on one side of\r\nSt George's Channel was answered by a louder explosion on the other.\r\nThe Clare election, the Penenden Heath meeting showed that the time\r\nfor evasion and delay was past. A crisis had arrived which made it\r\nabsolutely necessary for the Government to take one side or the other. A\r\nsimple issue was proposed to the right honourable Baronet, concession\r\nor civil war; to disgust his party, or to ruin his country. He chose\r\nthe good part. He performed a duty, deeply painful, in some sense\r\nhumiliating, yet in truth highly honourable to him. He came down to this\r\nHouse and proposed the emancipation of the Roman Catholics. Among his\r\nadherents were some who, like himself, had opposed the Roman Catholic\r\nclaims merely on the ground of political expediency; and these persons\r\nreadily consented to support his new policy. But not so the great body\r\nof his followers. Their zeal for Protestant ascendency was a ruling\r\npassion, a passion, too, which they thought it a virtue to indulge. They\r\nhad exerted themselves to raise to power the man whom they regarded as\r\nthe ablest and most trusty champion of that ascendency; and he had not\r\nonly abandoned the good cause, but had become its adversary. Who can\r\nforget in what a roar of obloquy their anger burst forth? Never before\r\nwas such a flood of calumny and invective poured on a single head. All\r\nhistory, all fiction were ransacked by the old friends of the right\r\nhonourable Baronet, for nicknames and allusions. One right honourable\r\ngentleman, who I am sorry not to see in his place opposite, found\r\nEnglish prose too weak to express his indignation, and pursued his\r\nperfidious chief with reproaches borrowed from the ravings of the\r\ndeserted Dido. Another Tory explored Holy Writ for parallels, and could\r\nfind no parallel but Judas Iscariot. The great university which had been\r\nproud to confer on the right honourable Baronet the highest marks of\r\nfavour, was foremost in affixing the brand of infamy. From Cornwall,\r\nfrom Northumberland, clergymen came up by hundreds to Oxford, in order\r\nto vote against him whose presence, a few days before, would have set\r\nthe bells of their parish churches jingling. Nay, such was the violence\r\nof this new enmity that the old enmity of the Tories to Whigs, Radicals,\r\nDissenters, Papists, seemed to be forgotten. That Ministry which, when\r\nit came into power at the close of 1828, was one of the strongest that\r\nthe country ever saw, was, at the close of 1829, one of the weakest. It\r\nlingered another year, staggering between two parties, leaning now on\r\none, now on the other, reeling sometimes under a blow from the right,\r\nsometimes under a blow from the left, and certain to fall as soon as the\r\nTory opposition and the Whig opposition could find a question on which\r\nto unite. Such a question was found: and that Ministry fell without a\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\nNow what I wish to know is this. What reason have we to believe that any\r\nadministration which the right honourable Baronet can now form will have\r\na different fate? Is he changed since 1829? Is his party changed? He\r\nis, I believe, still the same, still a statesman, moderate in opinions,\r\ncautious in temper, perfectly free from that fanaticism which inflames\r\nso many of his supporters. As to his party, I admit that it is not\r\nthe same; for it is very much worse. It is decidedly fiercer and\r\nmore unreasonable than it was eleven years ago. I judge by its public\r\nmeetings; I judge by its journals; I judge by its pulpits, pulpits which\r\nevery week resound with ribaldry and slander such as would disgrace the\r\nhustings. A change has come over the spirit of a part, I hope not the\r\nlarger part, of the Tory body. It was once the glory of the Tories\r\nthat, through all changes of fortune, they were animated by a steady\r\nand fervent loyalty which made even error respectable, and gave to what\r\nmight otherwise have been called servility something of the manliness\r\nand nobleness of freedom. A great Tory poet, whose eminent services\r\nto the cause of monarchy had been ill requited by an ungrateful Court,\r\nboasted that\r\n\r\n     \"Loyalty is still the same,\r\n     Whether it win or lose the game;\r\n     True as the dial to the sun,\r\n     Although it be not shined upon.\"\r\n\r\nToryism has now changed its character. We have lived to see a monster of\r\na faction made up of the worst parts of the Cavalier and the worst parts\r\nof the Roundhead. We have lived to see a race of disloyal Tories. We\r\nhave lived to see Tories giving themselves the airs of those insolent\r\npikemen who puffed out their tobacco smoke in the face of Charles the\r\nFirst. We have lived to see Tories who, because they are not allowed to\r\ngrind the people after the fashion of Strafford, turn round and revile\r\nthe Sovereign in the style of Hugh Peters. I say, therefore, that, while\r\nthe leader is still what he was eleven years ago, when his moderation\r\nalienated his intemperate followers, his followers are more intemperate\r\nthan ever. It is my firm belief that the majority of them desire the\r\nrepeal of the Emancipation Act. You say, no. But I will give reasons,\r\nand unanswerable reasons, for what I say. How, if you really wish to\r\nmaintain the Emancipation Act, do you explain that clamour which you\r\nhave raised, and which has resounded through the whole kingdom, about\r\nthe three Popish Privy Councillors? You resent, as a calumny, the\r\nimputation that you wish to repeal the Emancipation Act; and yet you cry\r\nout that Church and State are in danger of ruin whenever the Government\r\ncarries that Act into effect. If the Emancipation Act is never to be\r\nexecuted, why should it not be repealed? I perfectly understand that an\r\nhonest man may wish it to be repealed. But I am at a loss to understand\r\nhow honest men can say, \"We wish the Emancipation Act to be maintained:\r\nyou who accuse us of wishing to repeal it slander us foully: we value\r\nit as much as you do. Let it remain among our statutes, provided always\r\nthat it remains as a dead letter. If you dare to put it in force,\r\nindeed, we will agitate against you; for, though we talk against\r\nagitation, we too can practice agitation: we will denounce you in our\r\nassociations; for, though we call associations unconstitutional, we\r\ntoo have our associations: our divines shall preach about Jezebel: our\r\ntavern spouters shall give significant hints about James the Second.\"\r\nYes, Sir, such hints have been given, hints that a sovereign who has\r\nmerely executed the law, ought to be treated like a sovereign who\r\ngrossly violated the law. I perfectly understand, as I said, that an\r\nhonest man may disapprove of the Emancipation Act, and may wish it\r\nrepealed. But can any man, who is of opinion that Roman Catholics ought\r\nto be admitted to office, honestly maintain that they now enjoy more\r\nthan their fair share of power and emolument? What is the proportion\r\nof Roman Catholics to the whole population of the United Kingdom?\r\nAbout one-fourth. What proportion of the Privy Councillors are Roman\r\nCatholics? About one-seventieth. And what, after all, is the power of a\r\nPrivy Councillor, merely as such? Are not the right honourable gentlemen\r\nopposite Privy Councillors? If a change should take place, will not the\r\npresent Ministers still be Privy Councillors? It is notorious that no\r\nPrivy Councillor goes to Council unless he is specially summoned. He is\r\ncalled Right Honourable, and he walks out of a room before Esquires and\r\nKnights. And can we seriously believe that men who think it monstrous\r\nthat this honorary distinction should be given to three Roman Catholics,\r\ndo sincerely desire to maintain a law by which a Roman Catholic may be\r\nCommander in Chief with all the military patronage, First Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty with all the naval patronage, or First Lord of the Treasury,\r\nwith the chief influence in every department of the Government. I must\r\ntherefore suppose that those who join in the cry against the three Privy\r\nCouncillors, are either imbecile or hostile to the Emancipation Act.\r\n\r\nI repeat, therefore, that, while the right honourable Baronet is as free\r\nfrom bigotry as he was eleven years ago, his party is more bigoted\r\nthan it was eleven years ago. The difficulty of governing Ireland in\r\nopposition to the feelings of the great body of the Irish people is, I\r\napprehend, as great now as it was eleven years ago. What then must be\r\nthe fate of a government formed by the right honourable Baronet? Suppose\r\nthat the event of this debate should make him Prime Minister? Should I\r\nbe wrong if I were to prophesy that three years hence he will be more\r\nhated and vilified by the Tory party than the present advisers of the\r\nCrown have been? Should I be wrong if I were to say that all those\r\nliterary organs which now deafen us with praise of him, will then deafen\r\nus with abuse of him? Should I be wrong if I were to say that he will\r\nbe burned in effigy by those who now drink his health with three times\r\nthree and one cheer more? Should I be wrong if I were to say that those\r\nvery gentlemen who have crowded hither to-night in order to vote him\r\ninto power, will crowd hither to vote Lord Melbourne back? Once already\r\nhave I seen those very persons go out into the lobby for the purpose of\r\ndriving the right honourable Baronet from the high situation to which\r\nthey had themselves exalted him. I went out with them myself; yes, with\r\nthe whole body of the Tory country gentlemen, with the whole body of\r\nhigh Churchmen. All the four University Members were with us. The effect\r\nof that division was to bring Lord Grey, Lord Althorpe, Lord Brougham,\r\nLord Durham into power. You may say that the Tories on that occasion\r\njudged ill, that they were blinded by vindictive passion, that if\r\nthey had foreseen all that followed they might have acted differently.\r\nPerhaps so. But what has been once may be again. I cannot think it\r\npossible that those who are now supporting the right honourable Baronet\r\nwill continue from personal attachment to support him if they see that\r\nhis policy is in essentials the same as Lord Melbourne's. I believe that\r\nthey have quite as much personal attachment to Lord Melbourne as to\r\nthe right honourable Baronet. They follow the right honourable Baronet\r\nbecause his abilities, his eloquence, his experience are necessary to\r\nthem; but they are but half reconciled to him. They never can forget\r\nthat, in the most important crisis of his public life, he deliberately\r\nchose rather to be the victim of their injustice than its instrument.\r\nIt is idle to suppose that they will be satisfied by seeing a new set of\r\nmen in power. Their maxim is most truly \"Measures, not men.\" They care\r\nnot before whom the sword of state is borne at Dublin, or who wears the\r\nbadge of St Patrick. What they abhor is not Lord Normanby personally or\r\nLord Ebrington personally, but the great principles in conformity with\r\nwhich Ireland has been governed by Lord Normanby and by Lord Ebrington,\r\nthe principles of justice, humanity, and religious freedom. What they\r\nwish to have in Ireland is not my Lord Haddington, or any other viceroy\r\nwhom the right honourable Baronet may select, but the tyranny of race\r\nover race, and of creed over creed. Give them what they want; and you\r\nconvulse the empire. Refuse them; and you dissolve the Tory party. I\r\nbelieve that the right honourable Baronet himself is by no means without\r\napprehensions that, if he were now called to the head of affairs, he\r\nwould, very speedily, have the dilemma of 1829 again before him. He\r\ncertainly was not without such apprehensions when, a few months ago,\r\nhe was commanded by Her Majesty to submit to her the plan of an\r\nadministration. The aspect of public affairs was not at that time\r\ncheering. The Chartists were stirring in England. There were troubles in\r\nCanada. There were great discontents in the West Indies. An expedition,\r\nof which the event was still doubtful, had been sent into the heart of\r\nAsia. Yet, among many causes of anxiety, the discerning eye of the right\r\nhonourable Baronet easily discerned the quarter where the great and\r\nimmediate danger lay. He told the House that his difficulty would\r\nbe Ireland. Now, Sir, that which would be the difficulty of his\r\nadministration is the strength of the present administration. Her\r\nMajesty's Ministers enjoy the confidence of Ireland; and I believe that\r\nwhat ought to be done for that country will excite less discontent\r\nhere if done by them than if done by him. He, I am afraid, great as his\r\nabilities are, and good as I willingly admit his intentions to be, would\r\nfind it easy to lose the confidence of his partisans, but hard indeed to\r\nwin the confidence of the Irish people.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed principally on account of Ireland that I feel solicitous\r\nabout the issue of the present debate. I well know how little chance he\r\nwho speaks on that theme has of obtaining a fair hearing. Would to\r\nGod that I were addressing an audience which would judge this great\r\ncontroversy as it is judged by foreign nations, and as it will be judged\r\nby future ages. The passions which inflame us, the sophisms which\r\ndelude us, will not last for ever. The paroxysms of faction have their\r\nappointed season. Even the madness of fanaticism is but for a day. The\r\ntime is coming when our conflicts will be to others what the conflicts\r\nof our forefathers are to us; when the preachers who now disturb the\r\nState, and the politicians who now make a stalking horse of the Church,\r\nwill be no more than Sacheverel and Harley. Then will be told, in\r\nlanguage very different from that which now calls forth applause from\r\nthe mob of Exeter Hall, the true story of these troubled years.\r\n\r\nThere was, it will then be said, a part of the kingdom of Queen Victoria\r\nwhich presented a lamentable contrast to the rest; not from the want of\r\nnatural fruitfulness, for there was no richer soil in Europe; not from\r\nwant of facilities for trade, for the coasts of this unhappy region were\r\nindented by bays and estuaries capable of holding all the navies of the\r\nworld; not because the people were too dull to improve these advantages\r\nor too pusillanimous to defend them; for in natural quickness of wit\r\nand gallantry of spirit they ranked high among the nations. But all the\r\nbounty of nature had been made unavailing by the crimes and errors of\r\nman. In the twelfth century that fair island was a conquered province.\r\nThe nineteenth century found it a conquered province still. During that\r\nlong interval many great changes had taken place which had conduced to\r\nthe general welfare of the empire: but those changes had only aggravated\r\nthe misery of Ireland. The Reformation came, bringing to England and\r\nScotland divine truth and intellectual liberty. To Ireland it brought\r\nonly fresh calamities. Two new war cries, Protestant and Catholic,\r\nanimated the old feud between the Englishry and the Irishry. The\r\nRevolution came, bringing to England and Scotland civil and spiritual\r\nfreedom, to Ireland subjugation, degradation, persecution. The Union\r\ncame: but though it joined legislatures, it left hearts as widely\r\ndisjoined as ever. Catholic Emancipation came: but it came too late;\r\nit came as a concession made to fear, and, having excited unreasonable\r\nhopes, was naturally followed by unreasonable disappointment. Then\r\ncame violent irritation, and numerous errors on both sides. Agitation\r\nproduced coercion, and coercion produced fresh agitation. Difficulties\r\nand dangers went on increasing, till a government arose which, all other\r\nmeans having failed, determined to employ the only means that had not\r\nyet been fairly tried, justice and mercy. The State, long the stepmother\r\nof the many, and the mother only of the few, became for the first time\r\nthe common parent of all the great family. The body of the people began\r\nto look on their rulers as friends. Battalion after battalion, squadron\r\nafter squadron was withdrawn from districts which, as it had till then\r\nbeen thought, could be governed by the sword alone. Yet the security\r\nof property and the authority of law became every day more complete.\r\nSymptoms of amendment, symptoms such as cannot be either concealed or\r\ncounterfeited, began to appear; and those who once despaired of the\r\ndestinies of Ireland began to entertain a confident hope that she would\r\nat length take among European nations that high place to which her\r\nnatural resources and the intelligence of her children entitle her to\r\naspire.\r\n\r\nIn words such as these, I am confident, will the next generation speak\r\nof the events in our time. Relying on the sure justice of history and\r\nposterity, I care not, as far as I am personally concerned, whether we\r\nstand or fall. That issue it is for the House to decide. Whether the\r\nresult will be victory or defeat, I know not. But I know that there are\r\ndefeats not less glorious than any victory; and yet I have shared in\r\nsome glorious victories. Those were proud and happy days;--some who sit\r\non the benches opposite can well remember, and must, I think, regret\r\nthem;--those were proud and happy days when, amidst the applauses and\r\nblessings of millions, my noble friend led us on in the great struggle\r\nfor the Reform Bill; when hundreds waited round our doors till sunrise\r\nto hear how we had sped; when the great cities of the north poured forth\r\ntheir population on the highways to meet the mails which brought from\r\nthe capital the tidings whether the battle of the people had been lost\r\nor won. Such days my noble friend cannot hope to see again. Two such\r\ntriumphs would be too much for one life. But perhaps there still awaits\r\nhim a less pleasing, a less exhilarating, but a not less honourable\r\ntask, the task of contending against superior numbers, and through\r\nyears of discomfiture, for those civil and religious liberties which are\r\ninseparably associated with the name of his illustrious house. At his\r\nside will not be wanting men who against all odds, and through all turns\r\nof fortune, in evil days and amidst evil tongues, will defend to the\r\nlast, with unabated spirit, the noble principles of Milton and of Locke.\r\nWe may be driven from office. We may be doomed to a life of opposition.\r\nWe may be made marks for the rancour of sects which, hating each other\r\nwith a deadly hatred, yet hate toleration still more. We may be exposed\r\nto the rage of Laud on one side, and of Praise-God-Barebones on the\r\nother. But justice will be done at last: and a portion of the praise\r\nwhich we bestow on the old champions and martyrs of freedom will not\r\nbe refused by future generations to the men who have in our days\r\nendeavoured to bind together in real union races too long estranged, and\r\nto efface, by the mild influence of a parental government, the fearful\r\ntraces which have been left by the misrule of ages.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR WITH CHINA. (APRIL 7, 1840) A SPEECH DELIVERED IN THE HOUSE OF\r\nCOMMONS ON THE 7TH OF APRIL, 1840.\r\n\r\nOn the seventh of April, 1840, Sir James Graham moved the following\r\nresolution:\r\n\r\n\"That it appears to this House, on consideration of the papers relating\r\nto China presented to this House by command of Her Majesty, that the\r\ninterruption in our commercial and friendly intercourse with that\r\ncountry, and the hostilities which have since taken place, are mainly to\r\nbe attributed to the want of foresight and precaution on the part of Her\r\nMajesty's present advisers, in respect to our relations with China, and\r\nespecially to their neglect to furnish the Superintendent at Canton with\r\npowers and instructions calculated to provide against the growing evils\r\nconnected with the contraband trade in opium, and adapted to the novel\r\nand difficult situation in which the Superintendent was placed.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the question had been put from the Chair the following Speech\r\nwas made.\r\n\r\nThe motion was rejected, after a debate of three nights, by 271 votes to\r\n261.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker,--If the right honourable Baronet, in rising to make an\r\nattack on the Government, was forced to own that he was unnerved and\r\noverpowered by his sense of the importance of the question with which he\r\nhad to deal, one who rises to repel that attack may, without any shame,\r\nconfess that he feels similar emotions. And yet I must say that the\r\nanxiety, the natural and becoming anxiety, with which Her Majesty's\r\nMinisters have awaited the judgment of the House on these papers, was\r\nnot a little allayed by the terms of the right honourable Baronet's\r\nmotion, and has been still more allayed by his speech. It was impossible\r\nfor us to doubt either his inclination or his ability to detect and\r\nto expose any fault which we might have committed, and we may well\r\ncongratulate ourselves on finding that, after the closest examination\r\ninto a long series of transactions, so extensive, so complicated, and,\r\nin some respects, so disastrous, so keen an assailant could produce only\r\nso futile an accusation.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, Sir, the resolution which the right honourable\r\nBaronet has moved relates entirely to events which took place before the\r\nrupture with the Chinese Government. That rupture took place in March,\r\n1839. The right honourable Baronet therefore does not propose to pass\r\nany censure on any step which has been taken by the Government within\r\nthe last thirteen months; and it will, I think, be generally admitted,\r\nthat when he abstains from censuring the proceedings of the Government,\r\nit is because the most unfriendly scrutiny can find nothing in those\r\nproceedings to censure. We by no means deny that he has a perfect right\r\nto propose a vote expressing disapprobation of what was done in 1837 or\r\n1838. At the same time, we cannot but be gratified by learning that he\r\napproves of our present policy, and of the measures which we have taken,\r\nsince the rupture, for the vindication of the national honour and for\r\nthe protection of the national interests.\r\n\r\nIt is also to be observed that the right honourable Baronet has not\r\nventured, either in his motion or in his speech, to charge Her Majesty's\r\nMinisters with any unwise or unjust act, with any act tending to lower\r\nthe character of England, or to give cause of offence to China. The only\r\nsins which he imputes to them are sins of omission. His complaint is\r\nmerely that they did not foresee the course which events would take at\r\nCanton, and that consequently they did not send sufficient instructions\r\nto the British resident who was stationed there. Now it is evident that\r\nsuch an accusation is of all accusations that which requires the fullest\r\nand most distinct proof; for it is of all accusations that which it is\r\neasiest to make and hardest to refute. A man charged with a culpable\r\nact which he has not committed has comparatively little difficulty in\r\nproving his innocence. But when the charge is merely this, that he has\r\nnot, in a long and intricate series of transactions, done all that it\r\nwould have been wise to do, how is he to vindicate himself? And the case\r\nwhich we are considering has this peculiarity, that the envoy to whom\r\nthe Ministers are said to have left too large a discretion was fifteen\r\nthousand miles from them. The charge against them therefore is this,\r\nthat they did not give such copious and particular directions as\r\nwere sufficient, in every possible emergency, for the guidance of a\r\nfunctionary, who was fifteen thousand miles off. Now, Sir, I am ready to\r\nadmit that, if the papers on our table related to important negotiations\r\nwith a neighbouring state, if they related, for example, to a\r\nnegotiation carried on with France, my noble friend the Secretary for\r\nForeign Affairs (Lord Palmerston.) might well have been blamed for\r\nsending instructions so meagre and so vague to our ambassador at Paris.\r\nFor my noble friend knows to-night what passed between our ambassador\r\nat Paris and the French Ministers yesterday; and a messenger despatched\r\nto-night from Downing Street will be at the Embassy in the Faubourg\r\nSaint Honore the day after to-morrow. But that constant and minute\r\ncontrol, which the Foreign Secretary is bound to exercise over\r\ndiplomatic agents who are near, becomes an useless and pernicious\r\nmeddling when exercised over agents who are separated from him by a\r\nvoyage of five months. There are on both sides of the House gentlemen\r\nconversant with the affairs of India. I appeal to those gentlemen. India\r\nis nearer to us than China. India is far better known to us than China.\r\nYet is it not universally acknowledged that India can be governed only\r\nin India? The authorities at home point out to a governor the general\r\nline of policy which they wish him to follow; but they do not send him\r\ndirections as to the details of his administration. How indeed is it\r\npossible that they should send him such directions? Consider in what a\r\nstate the affairs of this country would be if they were to be conducted\r\naccording to directions framed by the ablest statesman residing in\r\nBengal. A despatch goes hence asking for instructions while London is\r\nilluminating for the peace of Amiens. The instructions arrive when the\r\nFrench army is encamped at Boulogne, and when the whole island is up in\r\narms to repel invasion. A despatch is written asking for instructions\r\nwhen Bonaparte is at Elba. The instructions come when he is at the\r\nTuilleries. A despatch is written asking for instructions when he is at\r\nthe Tuilleries. The instructions come when he is at St Helena. It would\r\nbe just as impossible to govern India in London as to govern England at\r\nCalcutta. While letters are preparing here on the supposition that there\r\nis profound peace in the Carnatic, Hyder is at the gates of Fort St\r\nGeorge. While letters are preparing here on the supposition that trade\r\nis flourishing and that the revenue exceeds the expenditure, the crops\r\nhave failed, great agency houses have broken, and the government is\r\nnegotiating a loan on hard terms. It is notorious that the great men\r\nwho founded and preserved our Indian empire, Clive and Warren Hastings,\r\ntreated all particular orders which they received from home as mere\r\nwaste paper. Had not those great men had the sense and spirit so to\r\ntreat such orders, we should not now have had an Indian empire. But the\r\ncase of China is far stronger. For, though a person who is now writing a\r\ndespatch to Fort William in Leadenhall Street or Cannon Row, cannot know\r\nwhat events have happened in India within the last two months, he may be\r\nvery intimately acquainted with the general state of that country, with\r\nits wants, with its resources, with the habits and temper of the native\r\npopulation, and with the character of every prince and minister from\r\nNepaul to Tanjore. But what does anybody here know of China? Even those\r\nEuropeans who have been in that empire are almost as ignorant of it as\r\nthe rest of us. Everything is covered by a veil, through which a glimpse\r\nof what is within may occasionally be caught, a glimpse just sufficient\r\nto set the imagination at work, and more likely to mislead than to\r\ninform. The right honourable Baronet has told us that an Englishman at\r\nCanton sees about as much of China as a foreigner who should land at\r\nWapping and proceed no further would see of England. Certainly the\r\nsights and sounds of Wapping would give a foreigner but a very imperfect\r\nnotion of our Government, of our manufactures, of our agriculture, of\r\nthe state of learning and the arts among us. And yet the illustration\r\nis but a faint one. For a foreigner may, without seeing even Wapping,\r\nwithout visiting England at all, study our literature, and may thence\r\nform a vivid and correct idea of our institutions and manners. But the\r\nliterature of China affords us no such help. Obstacles unparalleled in\r\nany other country which has books must be surmounted by the student\r\nwho is determined to master the Chinese tongue. To learn to read is the\r\nbusiness of half a life. It is easier to become such a linguist as Sir\r\nWilliam Jones was than to become a good Chinese scholar. You may count\r\nupon your fingers the Europeans whose industry and genius, even when\r\nstimulated by the most fervent religious zeal, has triumphed over the\r\ndifficulties of a language without an alphabet. Here then is a country\r\nseparated from us physically by half the globe, separated from us\r\nstill more effectually by the barriers which the most jealous of all\r\ngovernments and the hardest of all languages oppose to the researches of\r\nstrangers. Is it then reasonable to blame my noble friend because he has\r\nnot sent to our envoys in such a country as this instructions as full\r\nand precise as it would have been his duty to send to a minister at\r\nBrussels or at the Hague? The right honourable Baronet who comes forward\r\nas the accuser on this occasion is really accusing himself. He was\r\na member of the Government of Lord Grey. He was himself concerned in\r\nframing the first instructions which were given by my noble friend to\r\nour first Superintendent at Canton. For those instructions the right\r\nhonourable Baronet frankly admits that he is himself responsible. Are\r\nthose instructions then very copious and minute? Not at all. They merely\r\nlay down general principles. The Resident, for example, is enjoined to\r\nrespect national usages, and to avoid whatever may shock the prejudices\r\nof the Chinese; but no orders are given him as to matters of detail.\r\nIn 1834 my noble friend quitted the Foreign Office, and the Duke of\r\nWellington went to it. Did the Duke of Wellington send out those copious\r\nand exact directions with which, according to the right honourable\r\nBaronet, the Government is bound to furnish its agent in China? No, Sir;\r\nthe Duke of Wellington, grown old in the conduct of great affairs, knows\r\nbetter than anybody that a man of very ordinary ability at Canton is\r\nlikely to be a better judge of what ought to be done on an emergency\r\narising at Canton than the greatest politician at Westminster can\r\npossibly be. His Grace, therefore, like a wise man as he is, wrote only\r\none letter to the Superintendent, and in that letter merely referred the\r\nSuperintendent to the general directions given by Lord Palmerston. And\r\nhow, Sir, does the right honourable Baronet prove that, by persisting in\r\nthe course which he himself took when in office, and which the Duke\r\nof Wellington took when in office, Her Majesty's present advisers have\r\nbrought on that rupture which we all deplore? He has read us, from the\r\nvoluminous papers which are on the table, much which has but a very\r\nremote connection with the question. He has said much about things which\r\nhappened before the present Ministry existed, and much about things\r\nwhich have happened at Canton since the rupture; but very little that\r\nis relevant to the issue raised by the resolution which he has himself\r\nproposed. That issue is simply this, whether the mismanagement of the\r\npresent Ministry produced the rupture. I listened to his long and able\r\nspeech with the greatest attention, and did my best to separate\r\nthat part which had any relation to his motion from a great mass of\r\nextraneous matter. If my analysis be correct, the charge which he brings\r\nagainst the Government consists of four articles.\r\n\r\nThe first article is, that the Government omitted to alter that part of\r\nthe original instructions which directed the Superintendent to reside at\r\nCanton.\r\n\r\nThe second article is, that the Government omitted to alter that part\r\nof the original instructions which directed the Superintendent to\r\ncommunicate directly with the representatives of the Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe third article is, that the Government omitted to follow the\r\nadvice of the Duke of Wellington, who had left at the Foreign Office a\r\nmemorandum recommending that a British ship of war should be stationed\r\nin the China sea.\r\n\r\nThe fourth article is, that the Government omitted to authorise and\r\nempower the Superintendent to put down the contraband trade carried on\r\nby British subjects with China.\r\n\r\nSuch, Sir, are the counts of this indictment. Of these counts, the\r\nfourth is the only one which will require a lengthened defence. The\r\nfirst three may be disposed of in very few words.\r\n\r\nAs to the first, the answer is simple. It is true that the Government\r\ndid not revoke that part of the instructions which directed the\r\nSuperintendent to reside at Canton; and it is true that this part of the\r\ninstructions did at one time cause a dispute between the Superintendent\r\nand the Chinese authorities. But it is equally true that this dispute\r\nwas accommodated early in 1837; that the Chinese Government furnished\r\nthe Superintendent with a passport authorising him to reside at Canton;\r\nthat, during the two years which preceded the rupture, the Chinese\r\nGovernment made no objection to his residing at Canton; and that there\r\nis not in all this huge blue book one word indicating that the rupture\r\nwas caused, directly or indirectly, by his residing at Canton. On the\r\nfirst count, therefore, I am confident that the verdict must be, Not\r\nGuilty.\r\n\r\nTo the second count we have a similar answer. It is true that there\r\nwas a dispute with the authorities of Canton about the mode of\r\ncommunication. But it is equally true that this dispute was settled by\r\na compromise. The Chinese made a concession as to the channel of\r\ncommunication. The Superintendent made a concession as to the form\r\nof communication. The question had been thus set at rest before the\r\nrupture, and had absolutely nothing to do with the rupture.\r\n\r\nAs to the third charge, I must tell the right honourable Baronet that\r\nhe has altogether misapprehended that memorandum which he so confidently\r\ncites. The Duke of Wellington did not advise the Government to station a\r\nship of war constantly in the China seas. The Duke, writing in 1835,\r\nat a time when the regular course of the trade had been interrupted,\r\nrecommended that a ship of war should be stationed near Canton, \"till\r\nthe trade should take its regular peaceable course.\" Those are His\r\nGrace's own words. Do they not imply that, when the trade had again\r\ntaken its regular peaceable course, it might be right to remove the ship\r\nof war? Well, Sir, the trade, after that memorandum was written, did\r\nresume its regular peaceable course: that the right honourable Baronet\r\nhimself will admit; for it is part of his own case that Sir George\r\nRobinson had succeeded in restoring quiet and security. The third charge\r\nthen is simply this, that the Ministers did not do in a time of perfect\r\ntranquillity what the Duke of Wellington thought that it would have been\r\nright to do in a time of trouble.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Sir, I come to the fourth charge, the only real charge; for\r\nthe other three are so futile that I hardly understand how the right\r\nhonourable Baronet should have ventured to bring them forward.\r\nThe fourth charge is, that the Ministers omitted to send to the\r\nSuperintendent orders and powers to suppress the contraband trade, and\r\nthat this omission was the cause of the rupture.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, let me ask whether it was not notorious, when the right\r\nhonourable Baronet was in office, that British subjects carried on an\r\nextensive contraband trade with China? Did the right honourable Baronet\r\nand his colleagues instruct the Superintendent to put down that trade?\r\nNever. That trade went on while the Duke of Wellington was at the\r\nForeign Office. Did the Duke of Wellington instruct the Superintendent\r\nto put down that trade? No, Sir, never. Are then the followers of the\r\nright honourable Baronet, are the followers of the Duke of Wellington,\r\nprepared to pass a vote of censure on us for following the example of\r\nthe right honourable Baronet and of the Duke of Wellington? But I am\r\nunderstating my case. Since the present Ministers came into office, the\r\nreasons against sending out such instructions were much stronger than\r\nwhen the right honourable Baronet was in office, or when the Duke of\r\nWellington was in office. Down to the month of May 1838, my noble friend\r\nhad good grounds for believing that the Chinese Government was about\r\nto legalise the trade in opium. It is by no means easy to follow the\r\nwindings of Chinese politics. But, it is certain that about four years\r\nago the whole question was taken into serious consideration at Pekin.\r\nThe attention of the Emperor was called to the undoubted fact, that the\r\nlaw which forbade the trade in opium was a dead letter. That law had\r\nbeen intended to guard against two evils, which the Chinese legislators\r\nseem to have regarded with equal horror, the importation of a noxious\r\ndrug, and the exportation of the precious metals. It was found, however,\r\nthat as many pounds of opium came in, and that as many pounds of silver\r\nwent out, as if there had been no such law. The only effect of the\r\nprohibition was that the people learned to think lightly of imperial\r\nedicts, and that no part of the great sums expended in the purchase\r\nof the forbidden luxury came into the imperial treasury. These\r\nconsiderations were set forth in a most luminous and judicious state\r\npaper, drawn by Tang Tzee, President of the Sacrificial Offices. I am\r\nsorry to hear that this enlightened Minister has been turned out of\r\noffice on account of his liberality: for to be turned out of office is,\r\nI apprehend, a much more serious misfortune in China than in England.\r\nTang Tzee argued that it was unwise to attempt to exclude opium, for\r\nthat, while millions desired to have it, no law would keep it out, and\r\nthat the manner in which it had long been brought in had produced an\r\ninjurious effect both on the revenues of the state and on the morals of\r\nthe people. Opposed to Tang Tzee was Tchu Sing, a statesman of a very\r\ndifferent class, of a class which, I am sorry to say, is not confined to\r\nChina. Tchu Sing appears to be one of those staunch conservatives who,\r\nwhen they find that a law is inefficient because it is too severe,\r\nimagine that they can make it efficient by making it more severe still.\r\nHis historical knowledge is much on a par with his legislative wisdom.\r\nHe seems to have paid particular attention to the rise and progress of\r\nour Indian Empire, and he informs his imperial master that opium is\r\nthe weapon by which England effects her conquests. She had, it seems,\r\npersuaded the people of Hindostan to smoke and swallow this besotting\r\ndrug, till they became so feeble in body and mind, that they were\r\nsubjugated without difficulty. Some time appears to have elapsed before\r\nthe Emperor made up his mind on the point in dispute between Tang Tzee\r\nand Tchu Sing. Our Superintendent, Captain Elliot, was of opinion that\r\nthe decision would be in favour of the rational view taken by Tang Tzee;\r\nand such, as I can myself attest, was, during part of the year 1837, the\r\nopinion of the whole mercantile community of Calcutta. Indeed, it was\r\nexpected that every ship which arrived in the Hoogley from Canton would\r\nbring the news that the opium trade had been declared legal. Nor was\r\nit known in London till May 1838, that the arguments of Tchu Sing had\r\nprevailed. Surely, Sir, it would have been most absurd to order Captain\r\nElliot to suppress this trade at a time when everybody expected that it\r\nwould soon cease to be contraband. The right honourable Baronet must,\r\nI think, himself admit that, till the month of May 1838, the Government\r\nhere omitted nothing that ought to have been done.\r\n\r\nThe question before us is therefore reduced to very narrow limits. It\r\nis merely this: Ought my noble friend, in May 1838, to have sent out a\r\ndespatch commanding and empowering Captain Elliot to put down the opium\r\ntrade? I do not think that it would have been right or wise to send\r\nout such a despatch. Consider, Sir, with what powers it would have been\r\nnecessary to arm the Superintendent. He must have been authorised to\r\narrest, to confine, to send across the sea any British subject whom he\r\nmight believe to have been concerned in introducing opium into China. I\r\ndo not deny that, under the Act of Parliament, the Government might have\r\ninvested him with this dictatorship. But I do say that the Government\r\nought not lightly to invest any man with such a dictatorship, and, that\r\nif, in consequence of directions sent out by the Government, numerous\r\nsubjects of Her Majesty had been taken into custody and shipped off to\r\nBengal or to England without being permitted to wind up their affairs,\r\nthis House would in all probability have called the Ministers to a\r\nstrict account. Nor do I believe that by sending such directions the\r\nGovernment would have averted the rupture which has taken place. I will\r\ngo further. I believe that, if such directions had been sent, we should\r\nnow have been, as we are, at war with China; and that we should have\r\nbeen at war in circumstances singularly dishonourable and disastrous.\r\n\r\nFor, Sir, suppose that the Superintendent had been authorised and\r\ncommanded by the Government to put forth an order prohibiting British\r\nsubjects from trading in opium; suppose that he had put forth such an\r\norder; how was he to enforce it? The right honourable Baronet has had\r\ntoo much experience of public affairs to imagine that a lucrative trade\r\nwill be suppressed by a sheet of paper and a seal. In England we have a\r\npreventive service which costs us half a million a year. We employ more\r\nthan fifty cruisers to guard our coasts. We have six thousand effective\r\nmen whose business is to intercept smugglers. And yet everybody knows\r\nthat every article which is much desired, which is easily concealed, and\r\nwhich is heavily taxed, is smuggled into our island to a great extent.\r\nThe quantity of brandy which comes in without paying duty is known to\r\nbe not less than six hundred thousand gallons a year. Some people think\r\nthat the quantity of tobacco which is imported clandestinely is as great\r\nas the quantity which goes through the custom-houses. Be this as it may,\r\nthere is no doubt that the illicit importation is enormous. It has been\r\nproved before a Committee of this House that not less than four millions\r\nof pounds of tobacco have lately been smuggled into Ireland. And all\r\nthis, observe, has been done in spite of the most efficient preventive\r\nservice that I believe ever existed in the world. Consider too that the\r\nprice of an ounce of opium is far, very far higher than the price of a\r\npound of tobacco. Knowing this, knowing that the whole power of King,\r\nLords, and Commons cannot here put a stop to a traffic less easy, and\r\nless profitable than the traffic in opium, can you believe that an\r\norder prohibiting the traffic in opium would have been readily obeyed?\r\nRemember by what powerful motives both the buyer and the seller would\r\nhave been impelled to deal with each other. The buyer would have been\r\ndriven to the seller by something little short of torture, by a physical\r\ncraving as fierce and impatient as any to which our race is subject.\r\nFor, when stimulants of this sort have been long used, they are desired\r\nwith a rage which resembles the rage of hunger. The seller would have\r\nbeen driven to the buyer by the hope of vast and rapid gain. And do\r\nyou imagine that the intense appetite on one side for what had become a\r\nnecessary of life, and on the other for riches, would have been appeased\r\nby a few lines signed Charles Elliot? The very utmost effect which it\r\nis possible to believe that such an order would have produced would\r\nhave been this, that the opium trade would have left Canton, where the\r\ndealers were under the eye of the Superintendent, and where they would\r\nhave run some risk of being punished by him, and would have spread\r\nitself along the coast. If we know anything about the Chinese\r\nGovernment, we know this, that its coastguard is neither trusty nor\r\nefficient; and we know that a coastguard as trusty and efficient as\r\nour own would not be able to cut off communication between the merchant\r\nlonging for silver and the smoker longing for his pipe. Whole fleets\r\nof vessels would have managed to land their cargoes along the shore.\r\nConflicts would have arisen between our countrymen and the local\r\nmagistrates, who would not, like the authorities of Canton, have\r\nhad some knowledge of European habits and feelings. The mere malum\r\nprohibitum would, as usual, have produced the mala in se. The unlawful\r\ntraffic would inevitably have led to a crowd of acts, not only unlawful,\r\nbut immoral. The smuggler would, by the almost irresistible force of\r\ncircumstances, have been turned into a pirate. We know that, even at\r\nCanton, where the smugglers stand in some awe of the authority of the\r\nSuperintendent and of the opinion of an English society which contains\r\nmany respectable persons, the illicit trade has caused many brawls and\r\noutrages. What, then, was to be expected when every captain of a ship\r\nladen with opium would have been the sole judge of his own conduct? It\r\nis easy to guess what would have happened. A boat is sent ashore to fill\r\nthe water-casks and to buy fresh provisions. The provisions are refused.\r\nThe sailors take them by force. Then a well is poisoned. Two or three\r\nof the ship's company die in agonies. The crew in a fury land, shoot\r\nand stab every man whom they meet, and sack and burn a village. Is this\r\nimprobable? Have not similar causes repeatedly produced similar effects?\r\nDo we not know that the jealous vigilance with which Spain excluded the\r\nships of other nations from her Transatlantic possessions turned men who\r\nwould otherwise have been honest merchant adventurers into buccaneers?\r\nThe same causes which raised up one race of buccaneers in the Gulf of\r\nMexico would soon have raised up another in the China Sea. And can\r\nwe doubt what would in that case have been the conduct of the Chinese\r\nauthorities at Canton? We see that Commissioner Lin has arrested and\r\nconfined men of spotless character, men whom he had not the slightest\r\nreason to suspect of being engaged in any illicit commerce. He did so on\r\nthe ground that some of their countrymen had violated the revenue\r\nlaws of China. How then would he have acted if he had learned that\r\nthe red-headed devils had not merely been selling opium, but had been\r\nfighting, plundering, slaying, burning? Would he not have put forth\r\na proclamation in his most vituperative style, setting forth that the\r\nOutside Barbarians had undertaken to stop the contraband trade, but that\r\nthey had been found deceivers, that the Superintendent's edict was a\r\nmere pretence, that there was more smuggling than ever, that to the\r\nsmuggling had been added robbery and murder, and that therefore he\r\nshould detain all men of the guilty race as hostages till reparation\r\nshould be made? I say, therefore, that, if the Ministers had done that\r\nwhich the right honourable Baronet blames them for not doing, we should\r\nonly have reached by a worse way the point at which we now are.\r\n\r\nI have now, Sir, gone through the four heads of the charge brought\r\nagainst the Government; and I say with confidence that the interruption\r\nof our friendly relations with China cannot justly be imputed to any one\r\nof the omissions mentioned by the right honourable Baronet. In truth, if\r\nI could feel assured that no gentleman would vote for the motion without\r\nattentively reading it, and considering whether the proposition which it\r\naffirms has been made out, I should have no uneasiness as to the\r\nresult of this debate. But I know that no member weighs the words of a\r\nresolution for which he is asked to vote, as he would weigh the words\r\nof an affidavit which he was asked to swear. And I am aware that\r\nsome persons, for whose humanity and honesty I entertain the greatest\r\nrespect, are inclined to divide with the right honourable Baronet, not\r\nbecause they think that he has proved his case, but because they have\r\ntaken up a notion that we are making war for the purpose of forcing\r\nthe Government of China to admit opium into that country, and that,\r\ntherefore, we richly deserve to be censured. Certainly, Sir, if we\r\nhad been guilty of such absurdity and such atrocity as those gentlemen\r\nimpute to us, we should deserve not only censure but condign punishment.\r\nBut the imputation is altogether unfounded. Our course was clear. We may\r\ndoubt indeed whether the Emperor of China judged well in listening to\r\nTchu Sing and disgracing Tang Tzee. We may doubt whether it be a wise\r\npolicy to exclude altogether from any country a drug which is often\r\nfatally abused, but which to those who use it rightly is one of the\r\nmost precious boons vouchsafed by Providence to man, powerful to assuage\r\npain, to soothe irritation, and to restore health. We may doubt whether\r\nit be a wise policy to make laws for the purpose of preventing the\r\nprecious metals from being exported in the natural course of trade. We\r\nhave learned from all history, and from our own experience, that revenue\r\ncutters, custom-house officers, informers, will never keep out of any\r\ncountry foreign luxuries of small bulk for which consumers are willing\r\nto pay high prices, and will never prevent gold and silver from going\r\nabroad in exchange for such luxuries. We cannot believe that what\r\nEngland with her skilfully organised fiscal system and her gigantic\r\nmarine, has never been able to effect, will be accomplished by the junks\r\nwhich are at the command of the mandarins of China. But, whatever our\r\nopinion on these points may be, we are perfectly aware that they are\r\npoints which it belongs not to us but to the Emperor of China to decide.\r\nHe had a perfect right to keep out opium and to keep in silver, if he\r\ncould do so by means consistent with morality and public law. If his\r\nofficers seized a chest of the forbidden drug, we were not entitled to\r\ncomplain; nor did we complain. But when, finding that they could not\r\nsuppress the contraband trade by just means, they resorted to means\r\nflagrantly unjust, when they imprisoned our innocent countrymen, when\r\nthey insulted our Sovereign in the person of her representative, then\r\nit became our duty to demand satisfaction. Whether the opium trade be\r\na pernicious trade is not the question. Take a parallel case: take the\r\nmost execrable crime that ever was called a trade, the African slave\r\ntrade. You will hardly say that a contraband trade in opium is more\r\nimmoral than a contraband trade in negroes. We prohibited slave-trading:\r\nwe made it felony; we made it piracy; we invited foreign powers to join\r\nwith us in putting it down; to some foreign powers we paid large sums\r\nin order to obtain their co-operation; we employed our naval force to\r\nintercept the kidnappers; and yet it is notorious that, in spite of all\r\nour exertions and sacrifices, great numbers of slaves were, even as\r\nlate as ten or twelve years ago, introduced from Madagascar into our\r\nown island of Mauritius. Assuredly it was our right, it was our duty, to\r\nguard the coasts of that island strictly, to stop slave ships, to bring\r\nthe buyers and sellers to punishment. But suppose, Sir, that a ship\r\nunder French colours was seen skulking near the island, that the\r\nGovernor was fully satisfied from her build, her rigging, and her\r\nmovements, that she was a slaver, and was only waiting for the night to\r\nput on shore the wretches who were in her hold. Suppose that, not having\r\na sufficient naval force to seize this vessel, he were to arrest thirty\r\nor forty French merchants, most of whom had never been suspected of\r\nslave-trading, and were to lock them up. Suppose that he were to lay\r\nviolent hands on the French consul. Suppose that the Governor were\r\nto threaten to starve his prisoners to death unless they produced the\r\nproprietor of the slaver. Would not the French Government in such a case\r\nhave a right to demand reparation? And, if we refused reparation, would\r\nnot the French Government have a right to exact reparation by arms? And\r\nwould it be enough for us to say, \"This is a wicked trade, an inhuman\r\ntrade. Think of the misery of the poor creatures who are torn from their\r\nhomes. Think of the horrors of the middle passage. Will you make war in\r\norder to force us to admit slaves into our colonies?\" Surely the answer\r\nof the French would be, \"We are not making war in order to force you\r\nto admit slaves into the Mauritius. By all means keep them out. By\r\nall means punish every man, French or English, whom you can convict of\r\nbringing them in. What we complain of is that you have confounded\r\nthe innocent with the guilty, and that you have acted towards the\r\nrepresentative of our government in a manner inconsistent with the law\r\nof nations. Do not, in your zeal for one great principle, trample on all\r\nthe other great principles of morality.\" Just such are the grounds on\r\nwhich Her Majesty has demanded reparation from China. And was it not\r\ntime? See, Sir, see how rapidly injury has followed injury. The Imperial\r\nCommissioner, emboldened by the facility with which he had perpetrated\r\nthe first outrage, and utterly ignorant of the relative position of his\r\ncountry and ours in the scale of power and civilisation, has risen in\r\nhis requisitions. He began by confiscating property. His next demand was\r\nfor innocent blood. A Chinese had been slain. Careful inquiry was made;\r\nbut it was impossible to ascertain who was the slayer, or even to\r\nwhat nation the slayer belonged. No matter. It was notified to the\r\nSuperintendent that some subject of the Queen, innocent or guilty, must\r\nbe delivered up to suffer death. The Superintendent refused to comply.\r\nThen our countrymen at Canton were seized. Those who were at Macao\r\nwere driven thence: not men alone, but women with child, babies at the\r\nbreast. The fugitives begged in vain for a morsel of bread. Our Lascars,\r\npeople of a different colour from ours, but still our fellow-subjects,\r\nwere flung into the sea. An English gentleman was barbarously mutilated.\r\nAnd was this to be borne? I am far from thinking that we ought, in our\r\ndealings with such a people as the Chinese, to be litigious on points\r\nof etiquette. The place of our country among the nations of the world is\r\nnot so mean or so ill ascertained that we need resent mere impertinence,\r\nwhich is the effect of a very pitiable ignorance. Conscious of superior\r\npower, we can bear to hear our Sovereign described as a tributary of the\r\nCelestial Empire. Conscious of superior knowledge we can bear to hear\r\nourselves described as savages destitute of every useful art. When our\r\nambassadors were required to perform a prostration, which in Europe\r\nwould have been considered as degrading, we were rather amused than\r\nirritated. It would have been unworthy of us to have recourse to arms on\r\naccount of an uncivil phrase, or of a dispute about a ceremony. But this\r\nis not a question of phrases and ceremonies. The liberties and lives of\r\nEnglishmen are at stake: and it is fit that all nations, civilised and\r\nuncivilised, should know that, wherever the Englishman may wander, he is\r\nfollowed by the eye and guarded by the power of England.\r\n\r\nI was much touched, and so, I dare say, were many other gentlemen, by\r\na passage in one of Captain Elliot's despatches. I mean that passage in\r\nwhich he describes his arrival at the factory in the moment of extreme\r\ndanger. As soon as he landed he was surrounded by his countrymen, all\r\nin an agony of distress and despair. The first thing which he did was\r\nto order the British flag to be brought from his boat and planted in\r\nthe balcony. The sight immediately revived the hearts of those who had\r\na minute before given themselves up for lost. It was natural that they\r\nshould look up with hope and confidence to that victorious flag. For it\r\nreminded them that they belonged to a country unaccustomed to defeat, to\r\nsubmission, or to shame; to a country which had exacted such reparation\r\nfor the wrongs of her children as had made the ears of all who heard\r\nof it to tingle; to a country which had made the Dey of Algiers humble\r\nhimself to the dust before her insulted Consul; to a country which had\r\navenged the victims of the Black Hole on the Field of Plassey; to a\r\ncountry which had not degenerated since the Great Protector vowed that\r\nhe would make the name of Englishman as much respected as ever had been\r\nthe name of Roman citizen. They knew that, surrounded as they were by\r\nenemies, and separated by great oceans and continents from all help, not\r\na hair of their heads would be harmed with impunity. On this part of the\r\nsubject I believe that both the great contending parties in this House\r\nare agreed. I did not detect in the speech of the right honourable\r\nBaronet,--and I listened to that speech with the closest attention,--one\r\nword indicating that he is less disposed than we to insist on full\r\nsatisfaction for the great wrong which has been done. I cannot believe\r\nthat the House will pass a vote of censure so grossly unjust as that\r\nwhich he has moved. But I rejoice to think that, whether we are censured\r\nor not, the national honour will still be safe. There may be a change of\r\nmen; but, as respects China, there will be no change of measures. I have\r\ndone; and have only to express my fervent hope that this most righteous\r\nquarrel may be prosecuted to a speedy and triumphant close; that the\r\nbrave men to whom is intrusted the task of exacting reparation may\r\nperform their duty in such a manner as to spread, throughout regions\r\nin which the English name is hardly known, the fame not only of English\r\nskill and valour, but of English mercy and moderation; and that the\r\noverruling care of that gracious Providence which has so often brought\r\ngood out of evil may make the war to which we have been forced the means\r\nof establishing a durable peace, beneficial alike to the victors and the\r\nvanquished.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPYRIGHT. (FEBRUARY 5, 1841) A SPEECH DELIVERED IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS\r\nON THE 5TH OF FEBRUARY 1841.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-ninth of January 1841, Mr Serjeant Talfourd obtained leave\r\nto bring in a bill to amend the law of copyright. The object of this\r\nbill was to extend the term of copyright in a book to sixty years,\r\nreckoned from the death of the writer.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth of February Mr Serjeant Talfourd moved that the bill should\r\nbe read a second time. In reply to him the following Speech was made.\r\nThe bill was rejected by 45 votes to 38.\r\n\r\nThough, Sir, it is in some sense agreeable to approach a subject with\r\nwhich political animosities have nothing to do, I offer myself to your\r\nnotice with some reluctance. It is painful to me to take a course which\r\nmay possibly be misunderstood or misrepresented as unfriendly to the\r\ninterests of literature and literary men. It is painful to me, I will\r\nadd, to oppose my honourable and learned friend on a question which\r\nhe has taken up from the purest motives, and which he regards with a\r\nparental interest. These feelings have hitherto kept me silent when\r\nthe law of copyright has been under discussion. But as I am, on full\r\nconsideration, satisfied that the measure before us will, if adopted,\r\ninflict grievous injury on the public, without conferring any\r\ncompensating advantage on men of letters, I think it my duty to avow\r\nthat opinion and to defend it.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be done, Sir, is to settle on what principles the\r\nquestion is to be argued. Are we free to legislate for the public good,\r\nor are we not? Is this a question of expediency, or is it a question\r\nof right? Many of those who have written and petitioned against the\r\nexisting state of things treat the question as one of right. The law of\r\nnature, according to them, gives to every man a sacred and indefeasible\r\nproperty in his own ideas, in the fruits of his own reason and\r\nimagination. The legislature has indeed the power to take away this\r\nproperty, just as it has the power to pass an act of attainder for\r\ncutting off an innocent man's head without a trial. But, as such an act\r\nof attainder would be legal murder, so would an act invading the\r\nright of an author to his copy be, according to these gentlemen, legal\r\nrobbery.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, if this be so, let justice be done, cost what it may. I am\r\nnot prepared, like my honourable and learned friend, to agree to a\r\ncompromise between right and expediency, and to commit an injustice for\r\nthe public convenience. But I must say, that his theory soars far beyond\r\nthe reach of my faculties. It is not necessary to go, on the present\r\noccasion, into a metaphysical inquiry about the origin of the right of\r\nproperty; and certainly nothing but the strongest necessity would lead\r\nme to discuss a subject so likely to be distasteful to the House. I\r\nagree, I own, with Paley in thinking that property is the creature of\r\nthe law, and that the law which creates property can be defended only\r\non this ground, that it is a law beneficial to mankind. But it is\r\nunnecessary to debate that point. For, even if I believed in a natural\r\nright of property, independent of utility and anterior to legislation, I\r\nshould still deny that this right could survive the original proprietor.\r\nFew, I apprehend, even of those who have studied in the most mystical\r\nand sentimental schools of moral philosophy, will be disposed to\r\nmaintain that there is a natural law of succession older and of higher\r\nauthority than any human code. If there be, it is quite certain that\r\nwe have abuses to reform much more serious than any connected with the\r\nquestion of copyright. For this natural law can be only one; and the\r\nmodes of succession in the Queen's dominions are twenty. To go no\r\nfurther than England, land generally descends to the eldest son. In Kent\r\nthe sons share and share alike. In many districts the youngest takes the\r\nwhole. Formerly a portion of a man's personal property was secured to\r\nhis family; and it was only of the residue that he could dispose by\r\nwill. Now he can dispose of the whole by will: but you limited his\r\npower, a few years ago, by enacting that the will should not be valid\r\nunless there were two witnesses. If a man dies intestate, his personal\r\nproperty generally goes according to the statute of distributions; but\r\nthere are local customs which modify that statute. Now which of all\r\nthese systems is conformed to the eternal standard of right? Is it\r\nprimogeniture, or gavelkind, or borough English? Are wills jure divino?\r\nAre the two witnesses jure divino? Might not the pars rationabilis\r\nof our old law have a fair claim to be regarded as of celestial\r\ninstitution? Was the statute of distributions enacted in Heaven long\r\nbefore it was adopted by Parliament? Or is it to Custom of York, or to\r\nCustom of London, that this preeminence belongs? Surely, Sir, even those\r\nwho hold that there is a natural right of property must admit that rules\r\nprescribing the manner in which the effects of deceased persons shall be\r\ndistributed are purely arbitrary, and originate altogether in the will\r\nof the legislature. If so, Sir, there is no controversy between my\r\nhonourable and learned friend and myself as to the principles on which\r\nthis question is to be argued. For the existing law gives an author\r\ncopyright during his natural life; nor do I propose to invade that\r\nprivilege, which I should, on the contrary, be prepared to defend\r\nstrenuously against any assailant. The only point in issue between\r\nus is, how long after an author's death the State shall recognise a\r\ncopyright in his representatives and assigns; and it can, I think,\r\nhardly be disputed by any rational man that this is a point which the\r\nlegislature is free to determine in the way which may appear to be most\r\nconducive to the general good.\r\n\r\nWe may now, therefore, I think, descend from these high regions, where\r\nwe are in danger of being lost in the clouds, to firm ground and clear\r\nlight. Let us look at this question like legislators, and after fairly\r\nbalancing conveniences and inconveniences, pronounce between the\r\nexisting law of copyright, and the law now proposed to us. The question\r\nof copyright, Sir, like most questions of civil prudence, is neither\r\nblack nor white, but grey. The system of copyright has great advantages\r\nand great disadvantages; and it is our business to ascertain what these\r\nare, and then to make an arrangement under which the advantages may be\r\nas far as possible secured, and the disadvantages as far as possible\r\nexcluded. The charge which I bring against my honourable and learned\r\nfriend's bill is this, that it leaves the advantages nearly what they\r\nare at present, and increases the disadvantages at least fourfold.\r\n\r\nThe advantages arising from a system of copyright are obvious. It is\r\ndesirable that we should have a supply of good books; we cannot have\r\nsuch a supply unless men of letters are liberally remunerated; and the\r\nleast objectionable way of remunerating them is by means of copyright.\r\nYou cannot depend for literary instruction and amusement on the\r\nleisure of men occupied in the pursuits of active life. Such men may\r\noccasionally produce compositions of great merit. But you must not look\r\nto such men for works which require deep meditation and long research.\r\nWorks of that kind you can expect only from persons who make literature\r\nthe business of their lives. Of these persons few will be found among\r\nthe rich and the noble. The rich and the noble are not impelled to\r\nintellectual exertion by necessity. They may be impelled to intellectual\r\nexertion by the desire of distinguishing themselves, or by the desire\r\nof benefiting the community. But it is generally within these walls that\r\nthey seek to signalise themselves and to serve their fellow-creatures.\r\nBoth their ambition and their public spirit, in a country like this,\r\nnaturally take a political turn. It is then on men whose profession is\r\nliterature, and whose private means are not ample, that you must rely\r\nfor a supply of valuable books. Such men must be remunerated for their\r\nliterary labour. And there are only two ways in which they can be\r\nremunerated. One of those ways is patronage; the other is copyright.\r\n\r\nThere have been times in which men of letters looked, not to the public,\r\nbut to the government, or to a few great men, for the reward of their\r\nexertions. It was thus in the time of Maecenas and Pollio at Rome,\r\nof the Medici at Florence, of Louis the Fourteenth in France, of Lord\r\nHalifax and Lord Oxford in this country. Now, Sir, I well know that\r\nthere are cases in which it is fit and graceful, nay, in which it is a\r\nsacred duty to reward the merits or to relieve the distresses of men of\r\ngenius by the exercise of this species of liberality. But these cases\r\nare exceptions. I can conceive no system more fatal to the integrity and\r\nindependence of literary men than one under which they should be taught\r\nto look for their daily bread to the favour of ministers and nobles. I\r\ncan conceive no system more certain to turn those minds which are formed\r\nby nature to be the blessings and ornaments of our species into public\r\nscandals and pests.\r\n\r\nWe have, then, only one resource left. We must betake ourselves to\r\ncopyright, be the inconveniences of copyright what they may. Those\r\ninconveniences, in truth, are neither few nor small. Copyright is\r\nmonopoly, and produces all the effects which the general voice of\r\nmankind attributes to monopoly. My honourable and learned friend\r\ntalks very contemptuously of those who are led away by the theory that\r\nmonopoly makes things dear. That monopoly makes things dear is certainly\r\na theory, as all the great truths which have been established by the\r\nexperience of all ages and nations, and which are taken for granted in\r\nall reasonings, may be said to be theories. It is a theory in the same\r\nsense in which it is a theory that day and night follow each other, that\r\nlead is heavier than water, that bread nourishes, that arsenic poisons,\r\nthat alcohol intoxicates. If, as my honourable and learned friend seems\r\nto think, the whole world is in the wrong on this point, if the real\r\neffect of monopoly is to make articles good and cheap, why does he stop\r\nshort in his career of change? Why does he limit the operation of so\r\nsalutary a principle to sixty years? Why does he consent to anything\r\nshort of a perpetuity? He told us that in consenting to anything short\r\nof a perpetuity he was making a compromise between extreme right and\r\nexpediency. But if his opinion about monopoly be correct, extreme right\r\nand expediency would coincide. Or rather, why should we not restore the\r\nmonopoly of the East India trade to the East India Company? Why should\r\nwe not revive all those old monopolies which, in Elizabeth's reign,\r\ngalled our fathers so severely that, maddened by intolerable wrong, they\r\nopposed to their sovereign a resistance before which her haughty spirit\r\nquailed for the first and for the last time? Was it the cheapness and\r\nexcellence of commodities that then so violently stirred the indignation\r\nof the English people? I believe, Sir, that I may with safety take it\r\nfor granted that the effect of monopoly generally is to make articles\r\nscarce, to make them dear, and to make them bad. And I may with equal\r\nsafety challenge my honourable friend to find out any distinction\r\nbetween copyright and other privileges of the same kind; any reason why\r\na monopoly of books should produce an effect directly the reverse of\r\nthat which was produced by the East India Company's monopoly of tea, or\r\nby Lord Essex's monopoly of sweet wines. Thus, then, stands the case. It\r\nis good that authors should be remunerated; and the least exceptionable\r\nway of remunerating them is by a monopoly. Yet monopoly is an evil. For\r\nthe sake of the good we must submit to the evil; but the evil ought not\r\nto last a day longer than is necessary for the purpose of securing the\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nNow, I will not affirm that the existing law is perfect, that it\r\nexactly hits the point at which the monopoly ought to cease; but this\r\nI confidently say, that the existing law is very much nearer that point\r\nthan the law proposed by my honourable and learned friend. For consider\r\nthis; the evil effects of the monopoly are proportioned to the length\r\nof its duration. But the good effects for the sake of which we bear\r\nwith the evil effects are by no means proportioned to the length of its\r\nduration. A monopoly of sixty years produces twice as much evil as\r\na monopoly of thirty years, and thrice as much evil as a monopoly of\r\ntwenty years. But it is by no means the fact that a posthumous monopoly\r\nof sixty years gives to an author thrice as much pleasure and thrice\r\nas strong a motive as a posthumous monopoly of twenty years. On the\r\ncontrary, the difference is so small as to be hardly perceptible. We\r\nall know how faintly we are affected by the prospect of very distant\r\nadvantages, even when they are advantages which we may reasonably hope\r\nthat we shall ourselves enjoy. But an advantage that is to be enjoyed\r\nmore than half a century after we are dead, by somebody, we know not by\r\nwhom, perhaps by somebody unborn, by somebody utterly unconnected with\r\nus, is really no motive at all to action. It is very probable that in\r\nthe course of some generations land in the unexplored and unmapped heart\r\nof the Australasian continent will be very valuable. But there is none\r\nof us who would lay down five pounds for a whole province in the heart\r\nof the Australasian continent. We know, that neither we, nor anybody for\r\nwhom we care, will ever receive a farthing of rent from such a province.\r\nAnd a man is very little moved by the thought that in the year 2000 or\r\n2100, somebody who claims through him will employ more shepherds than\r\nPrince Esterhazy, and will have the finest house and gallery of pictures\r\nat Victoria or Sydney. Now, this is the sort of boon which my honourable\r\nand learned friend holds out to authors. Considered as a boon to them,\r\nit is a mere nullity, but considered as an impost on the public, it is\r\nno nullity, but a very serious and pernicious reality. I will take an\r\nexample. Dr Johnson died fifty-six years ago. If the law were what my\r\nhonourable and learned friend wishes to make it, somebody would now have\r\nthe monopoly of Dr Johnson's works. Who that somebody would be it is\r\nimpossible to say; but we may venture to guess. I guess, then, that\r\nit would have been some bookseller, who was the assign of another\r\nbookseller, who was the grandson of a third bookseller, who had bought\r\nthe copyright from Black Frank, the doctor's servant and residuary\r\nlegatee, in 1785 or 1786. Now, would the knowledge that this copyright\r\nwould exist in 1841 have been a source of gratification to Johnson?\r\nWould it have stimulated his exertions? Would it have once drawn him out\r\nof his bed before noon? Would it have once cheered him under a fit of\r\nthe spleen? Would it have induced him to give us one more allegory, one\r\nmore life of a poet, one more imitation of Juvenal? I firmly believe\r\nnot. I firmly believe that a hundred years ago, when he was writing our\r\ndebates for the Gentleman's Magazine, he would very much rather have had\r\ntwopence to buy a plate of shin of beef at a cook's shop underground.\r\nConsidered as a reward to him, the difference between a twenty years'\r\nand sixty years' term of posthumous copyright would have been nothing or\r\nnext to nothing. But is the difference nothing to us? I can buy Rasselas\r\nfor sixpence; I might have had to give five shillings for it. I can buy\r\nthe Dictionary, the entire genuine Dictionary, for two guineas, perhaps\r\nfor less; I might have had to give five or six guineas for it. Do I\r\ngrudge this to a man like Dr Johnson? Not at all. Show me that the\r\nprospect of this boon roused him to any vigorous effort, or sustained\r\nhis spirits under depressing circumstances, and I am quite willing to\r\npay the price of such an object, heavy as that price is. But what I do\r\ncomplain of is that my circumstances are to be worse, and Johnson's none\r\nthe better; that I am to give five pounds for what to him was not worth\r\na farthing.\r\n\r\nThe principle of copyright is this. It is a tax on readers for the\r\npurpose of giving a bounty to writers. The tax is an exceedingly bad\r\none; it is a tax on one of the most innocent and most salutary of human\r\npleasures; and never let us forget, that a tax on innocent pleasures\r\nis a premium on vicious pleasures. I admit, however, the necessity of\r\ngiving a bounty to genius and learning. In order to give such a bounty,\r\nI willingly submit even to this severe and burdensome tax. Nay, I am\r\nready to increase the tax, if it can be shown that by so doing I should\r\nproportionally increase the bounty. My complaint is, that my honourable\r\nand learned friend doubles, triples, quadruples, the tax, and makes\r\nscarcely any perceptible addition to the bounty. Why, Sir, what is the\r\nadditional amount of taxation which would have been levied on the public\r\nfor Dr Johnson's works alone, if my honourable and learned friend's\r\nbill had been the law of the land? I have not data sufficient to form\r\nan opinion. But I am confident that the taxation on his Dictionary alone\r\nwould have amounted to many thousands of pounds. In reckoning the whole\r\nadditional sum which the holders of his copyrights would have taken\r\nout of the pockets of the public during the last half century at twenty\r\nthousand pounds, I feel satisfied that I very greatly underrate it. Now,\r\nI again say that I think it but fair that we should pay twenty thousand\r\npounds in consideration of twenty thousand pounds' worth of pleasure and\r\nencouragement received by Dr Johnson. But I think it very hard that we\r\nshould pay twenty thousand pounds for what he would not have valued at\r\nfive shillings.\r\n\r\nMy honourable and learned friend dwells on the claims of the posterity\r\nof great writers. Undoubtedly, Sir, it would be very pleasing to see a\r\ndescendant of Shakespeare living in opulence on the fruits of his great\r\nancestor's genius. A house maintained in splendour by such a patrimony\r\nwould be a more interesting and striking object than Blenheim is to us,\r\nor than Strathfieldsaye will be to our children. But, unhappily, it is\r\nscarcely possible that, under any system, such a thing can come to pass.\r\nMy honourable and learned friend does not propose that copyright shall\r\ndescend to the eldest son, or shall be bound up by irrecoverable entail.\r\nIt is to be merely personal property. It is therefore highly improbable\r\nthat it will descend during sixty years or half that term from parent to\r\nchild. The chance is that more people than one will have an interest in\r\nit. They will in all probability sell it and divide the proceeds. The\r\nprice which a bookseller will give for it will bear no proportion to the\r\nsum which he will afterwards draw from the public, if his speculation\r\nproves successful. He will give little, if anything, more for a term of\r\nsixty years than for a term of thirty or five and twenty. The present\r\nvalue of a distant advantage is always small; but when there is great\r\nroom to doubt whether a distant advantage will be any advantage at all,\r\nthe present value sink to almost nothing. Such is the inconstancy of\r\nthe public taste that no sensible man will venture to pronounce, with\r\nconfidence, what the sale of any book published in our days will be\r\nin the years between 1890 and 1900. The whole fashion of thinking and\r\nwriting has often undergone a change in a much shorter period than\r\nthat to which my honourable and learned friend would extend posthumous\r\ncopyright. What would have been considered the best literary property\r\nin the earlier part of Charles the Second's reign? I imagine Cowley's\r\nPoems. Overleap sixty years, and you are in the generation of which Pope\r\nasked, \"Who now reads Cowley?\" What works were ever expected with more\r\nimpatience by the public than those of Lord Bolingbroke, which appeared,\r\nI think, in 1754? In 1814, no bookseller would have thanked you for the\r\ncopyright of them all, if you had offered it to him for nothing. What\r\nwould Paternoster Row give now for the copyright of Hayley's Triumphs of\r\nTemper, so much admired within the memory of many people still living? I\r\nsay, therefore, that, from the very nature of literary property, it will\r\nalmost always pass away from an author's family; and I say, that the\r\nprice given for it to the family will bear a very small proportion to\r\nthe tax which the purchaser, if his speculation turns out well, will in\r\nthe course of a long series of years levy on the public.\r\n\r\nIf, Sir, I wished to find a strong and perfect illustration of the\r\neffects which I anticipate from long copyright, I should select,--my\r\nhonourable and learned friend will be surprised,--I should select the\r\ncase of Milton's granddaughter. As often as this bill has been under\r\ndiscussion, the fate of Milton's granddaughter has been brought forward\r\nby the advocates of monopoly. My honourable and learned friend has\r\nrepeatedly told the story with great eloquence and effect. He has\r\ndilated on the sufferings, on the abject poverty, of this ill-fated\r\nwoman, the last of an illustrious race. He tells us that, in the\r\nextremity of her distress, Garrick gave her a benefit, that Johnson\r\nwrote a prologue, and that the public contributed some hundreds\r\nof pounds. Was it fit, he asks, that she should receive, in this\r\neleemosynary form, a small portion of what was in truth a debt? Why, he\r\nasks, instead of obtaining a pittance from charity, did she not live in\r\ncomfort and luxury on the proceeds of the sale of her ancestor's works?\r\nBut, Sir, will my honourable and learned friend tell me that this event,\r\nwhich he has so often and so pathetically described, was caused by the\r\nshortness of the term of copyright? Why, at that time, the duration of\r\ncopyright was longer than even he, at present, proposes to make it. The\r\nmonopoly lasted, not sixty years, but for ever. At the time at which\r\nMilton's granddaughter asked charity, Milton's works were the exclusive\r\nproperty of a bookseller. Within a few months of the day on which the\r\nbenefit was given at Garrick's theatre, the holder of the copyright of\r\nParadise Lost,--I think it was Tonson,--applied to the Court of Chancery\r\nfor an injunction against a bookseller who had published a cheap edition\r\nof the great epic poem, and obtained the injunction. The representation\r\nof Comus was, if I remember rightly, in 1750; the injunction in 1752.\r\nHere, then, is a perfect illustration of the effect of long copyright.\r\nMilton's works are the property of a single publisher. Everybody who\r\nwants them must buy them at Tonson's shop, and at Tonson's price.\r\nWhoever attempts to undersell Tonson is harassed with legal proceedings.\r\nThousands who would gladly possess a copy of Paradise Lost, must forego\r\nthat great enjoyment. And what, in the meantime, is the situation of the\r\nonly person for whom we can suppose that the author, protected at such\r\na cost to the public, was at all interested? She is reduced to utter\r\ndestitution. Milton's works are under a monopoly. Milton's granddaughter\r\nis starving. The reader is pillaged; but the writer's family is not\r\nenriched. Society is taxed doubly. It has to give an exorbitant price\r\nfor the poems; and it has at the same time to give alms to the only\r\nsurviving descendant of the poet.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. I think it right, Sir, to call the attention of\r\nthe House to an evil, which is perhaps more to be apprehended when an\r\nauthor's copyright remains in the hands of his family, than when it is\r\ntransferred to booksellers. I seriously fear that, if such a measure\r\nas this should be adopted, many valuable works will be either totally\r\nsuppressed or grievously mutilated. I can prove that this danger is\r\nnot chimerical; and I am quite certain that, if the danger be real,\r\nthe safeguards which my honourable and learned friend has devised are\r\naltogether nugatory. That the danger is not chimerical may easily be\r\nshown. Most of us, I am sure, have known persons who, very erroneously\r\nas I think, but from the best motives, would not choose to reprint\r\nFielding's novels, or Gibbon's History of the Decline and Fall of the\r\nRoman Empire. Some gentlemen may perhaps be of opinion that it would be\r\nas well if Tom Jones and Gibbon's History were never reprinted. I will\r\nnot, then, dwell on these or similar cases. I will take cases respecting\r\nwhich it is not likely that there will be any difference of opinion\r\nhere; cases, too, in which the danger of which I now speak is not matter\r\nof supposition, but matter of fact. Take Richardson's novels. Whatever\r\nI may, on the present occasion, think of my honourable and learned\r\nfriend's judgment as a legislator, I must always respect his judgment as\r\na critic. He will, I am sure, say that Richardson's novels are among\r\nthe most valuable, among the most original works in our language. No\r\nwritings have done more to raise the fame of English genius in foreign\r\ncountries. No writings are more deeply pathetic. No writings, those of\r\nShakspeare excepted, show more profound knowledge of the human heart. As\r\nto their moral tendency, I can cite the most respectable testimony. Dr\r\nJohnson describes Richardson as one who had taught the passions to move\r\nat the command of virtue. My dear and honoured friend, Mr Wilberforce,\r\nin his celebrated religious treatise, when speaking of the unchristian\r\ntendency of the fashionable novels of the eighteenth century, distinctly\r\nexcepts Richardson from the censure. Another excellent person, whom I\r\ncan never mention without respect and kindness, Mrs Hannah More, often\r\ndeclared in conversation, and has declared in one of her published\r\npoems, that she first learned from the writings of Richardson those\r\nprinciples of piety by which her life was guided. I may safely say that\r\nbooks celebrated as works of art through the whole civilised world, and\r\npraised for their moral tendency by Dr Johnson, by Mr Wilberforce, by\r\nMrs Hannah More, ought not to be suppressed. Sir, it is my firm belief,\r\nthat if the law had been what my honourable and learned friend proposes\r\nto make it, they would have been suppressed. I remember Richardson's\r\ngrandson well; he was a clergyman in the city of London; he was a most\r\nupright and excellent man; but he had conceived a strong prejudice\r\nagainst works of fiction. He thought all novel-reading not only\r\nfrivolous but sinful. He said,--this I state on the authority of one of\r\nhis clerical brethren who is now a bishop,--he said that he had never\r\nthought it right to read one of his grandfather's books. Suppose, Sir,\r\nthat the law had been what my honourable and learned friend would make\r\nit. Suppose that the copyright of Richardson's novels had descended, as\r\nmight well have been the case, to this gentleman. I firmly believe,\r\nthat he would have thought it sinful to give them a wide circulation.\r\nI firmly believe, that he would not for a hundred thousand pounds have\r\ndeliberately done what he thought sinful. He would not have reprinted\r\nthem. And what protection does my honourable and learned friend give to\r\nthe public in such a case? Why, Sir, what he proposes is this: if a book\r\nis not reprinted during five years, any person who wishes to reprint\r\nit may give notice in the London Gazette: the advertisement must be\r\nrepeated three times: a year must elapse; and then, if the proprietor of\r\nthe copyright does not put forth a new edition, he loses his exclusive\r\nprivilege. Now, what protection is this to the public? What is a new\r\nedition? Does the law define the number of copies that make an edition?\r\nDoes it limit the price of a copy? Are twelve copies on large paper,\r\ncharged at thirty guineas each, an edition? It has been usual, when\r\nmonopolies have been granted, to prescribe numbers and to limit prices.\r\nBut I did not find the my honourable and learned friend proposes to do\r\nso in the present case. And, without some such provision, the security\r\nwhich he offers is manifestly illusory. It is my conviction that, under\r\nsuch a system as that which he recommends to us, a copy of Clarissa\r\nwould have been as rare as an Aldus or a Caxton.\r\n\r\nI will give another instance. One of the most instructive, interesting,\r\nand delightful books in our language is Boswell's Life of Johnson.\r\nNow it is well known that Boswell's eldest son considered this book,\r\nconsidered the whole relation of Boswell to Johnson, as a blot in the\r\nescutcheon of the family. He thought, not perhaps altogether without\r\nreason, that his father had exhibited himself in a ludicrous and\r\ndegrading light. And thus he became so sore and irritable that at last\r\nhe could not bear to hear the Life of Johnson mentioned. Suppose that\r\nthe law had been what my honourable and learned friend wishes to\r\nmake it. Suppose that the copyright of Boswell's Life of Johnson had\r\nbelonged, as it well might, during sixty years, to Boswell's eldest\r\nson. What would have been the consequence? An unadulterated copy of the\r\nfinest biographical work in the world would have been as scarce as the\r\nfirst edition of Camden's Britannia.\r\n\r\nThese are strong cases. I have shown you that, if the law had been what\r\nyou are now going to make it, the finest prose work of fiction in the\r\nlanguage, the finest biographical work in the language, would very\r\nprobably have been suppressed. But I have stated my case weakly. The\r\nbooks which I have mentioned are singularly inoffensive books, books not\r\ntouching on any of those questions which drive even wise men beyond the\r\nbounds of wisdom. There are books of a very different kind, books which\r\nare the rallying points of great political and religious parties. What\r\nis likely to happen if the copyright of one of the these books should by\r\ndescent or transfer come into the possession of some hostile zealot? I\r\nwill take a single instance. It is only fifty years since John Wesley\r\ndied; and all his works, if the law had been what my honourable and\r\nlearned friend wishes to make it, would now have been the property of\r\nsome person or other. The sect founded by Wesley is the most numerous,\r\nthe wealthiest, the most powerful, the most zealous of sects. In every\r\nparliamentary election it is a matter of the greatest importance to\r\nobtain the support of the Wesleyan Methodists. Their numerical strength\r\nis reckoned by hundreds of thousands. They hold the memory of their\r\nfounder in the greatest reverence; and not without reason, for he was\r\nunquestionably a great and a good man. To his authority they constantly\r\nappeal. His works are in their eyes of the highest value. His doctrinal\r\nwritings they regard as containing the best system of theology ever\r\ndeduced from Scripture. His journals, interesting even to the common\r\nreader, are peculiarly interesting to the Methodist: for they contain\r\nthe whole history of that singular polity which, weak and despised\r\nin its beginning, is now, after the lapse of a century, so strong,\r\nso flourishing, and so formidable. The hymns to which he gave his\r\nimprimatur are a most important part of the public worship of his\r\nfollowers. Now, suppose that the copyright of these works should belong\r\nto some person who holds the memory of Wesley and the doctrines and\r\ndiscipline of the Methodists in abhorrence. There are many such persons.\r\nThe Ecclesiastical Courts are at this very time sitting on the case of\r\na clergyman of the Established Church who refused Christian burial to a\r\nchild baptized by a Methodist preacher. I took up the other day a work\r\nwhich is considered as among the most respectable organs of a large\r\nand growing party in the Church of England, and there I saw John Wesley\r\ndesignated as a forsworn priest. Suppose that the works of Wesley were\r\nsuppressed. Why, Sir, such a grievance would be enough to shake the\r\nfoundations of Government. Let gentlemen who are attached to the Church\r\nreflect for a moment what their feelings would be if the Book of Common\r\nPrayer were not to be reprinted for thirty or forty years, if the price\r\nof a Book of Common Prayer were run up to five or ten guineas. And\r\nthen let them determine whether they will pass a law under which it is\r\npossible, under which it is probable, that so intolerable a wrong may be\r\ndone to some sect consisting perhaps of half a million of persons.\r\n\r\nI am so sensible, Sir, of the kindness with which the House has listened\r\nto me, that I will not detain you longer. I will only say this, that if\r\nthe measure before us should pass, and should produce one-tenth part of\r\nthe evil which it is calculated to produce, and which I fully expect it\r\nto produce, there will soon be a remedy, though of a very objectionable\r\nkind. Just as the absurd acts which prohibited the sale of game were\r\nvirtually repealed by the poacher, just as many absurd revenue acts have\r\nbeen virtually repealed by the smuggler, so will this law be virtually\r\nrepealed by piratical booksellers. At present the holder of copyright\r\nhas the public feeling on his side. Those who invade copyright are\r\nregarded as knaves who take the bread out of the mouths of deserving\r\nmen. Everybody is well pleased to see them restrained by the law, and\r\ncompelled to refund their ill-gotten gains. No tradesman of good repute\r\nwill have anything to do with such disgraceful transactions. Pass this\r\nlaw: and that feeling is at an end. Men very different from the present\r\nrace of piratical booksellers will soon infringe this intolerable\r\nmonopoly. Great masses of capital will be constantly employed in the\r\nviolation of the law. Every art will be employed to evade legal pursuit;\r\nand the whole nation will be in the plot. On which side indeed should\r\nthe public sympathy be when the question is whether some book as\r\npopular as Robinson Crusoe, or the Pilgrim's Progress, shall be in every\r\ncottage, or whether it shall be confined to the libraries of the rich\r\nfor the advantage of the great-grandson of a bookseller who, a hundred\r\nyears before, drove a hard bargain for the copyright with the author\r\nwhen in great distress? Remember too that, when once it ceases to be\r\nconsidered as wrong and discreditable to invade literary property, no\r\nperson can say where the invasion will stop. The public seldom makes\r\nnice distinctions. The wholesome copyright which now exists will share\r\nin the disgrace and danger of the new copyright which you are about to\r\ncreate. And you will find that, in attempting to impose unreasonable\r\nrestraints on the reprinting of the works of the dead, you have, to\r\na great extent, annulled those restraints which now prevent men from\r\npillaging and defrauding the living. If I saw, Sir, any probability that\r\nthis bill could be so amended in the Committee that my objections might\r\nbe removed, I would not divide the House in this stage. But I am so\r\nfully convinced that no alteration which would not seem insupportable to\r\nmy honourable and learned friend, could render his measure supportable\r\nto me, that I must move, though with regret, that this bill be read a\r\nsecond time this day six months.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPYRIGHT. (APRIL 6, 1842) A SPEECH DELIVERED IN A COMMITTEE OF THE\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS ON THE 6TH OF APRIL 1842.\r\n\r\nOn the third of March 1842, Lord Mahon obtained permission to bring in\r\na bill to amend the Law of Copyright. This bill extended the term of\r\nCopyright in a book to twenty-five years, reckoned from the death of the\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\nOn the sixth of April the House went into Committee on the bill, and Mr\r\nGreene took the Chair. Several divisions took place, of which the result\r\nwas that the plan suggested in the following Speech was, with some\r\nmodifications, adopted.\r\n\r\nMr Greene,--I have been amused and gratified by the remarks which\r\nmy noble friend (Lord Mahon.) has made on the arguments by which I\r\nprevailed on the last House of Commons to reject the bill introduced by\r\na very able and accomplished man, Mr Serjeant Talfourd. My noble friend\r\nhas done me a high and rare honour. For this is, I believe, the first\r\noccasion on which a speech made in one Parliament has been answered in\r\nanother. I should not find it difficult to vindicate the soundness of\r\nthe reasons which I formerly urged, to set them in a clearer light,\r\nand to fortify them by additional facts. But it seems to me that we had\r\nbetter discuss the bill which is now on our table than the bill which\r\nwas there fourteen months ago. Glad I am to find that there is a very\r\nwide difference between the two bills, and that my noble friend,\r\nthough he has tried to refute my arguments, has acted as if he had been\r\nconvinced by them. I objected to the term of sixty years as far too\r\nlong. My noble friend has cut that term down to twenty-five years. I\r\nwarned the House that, under the provisions of Mr Serjeant Talfourd's\r\nbill, valuable works might not improbably be suppressed by the\r\nrepresentatives of authors. My noble friend has prepared a clause which,\r\nas he thinks, will guard against that danger. I will not, therefore,\r\nwaste the time of the Committee by debating points which he has\r\nconceded, but will proceed at once to the proper business of this\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nSir, I have no objection to the principle of my noble friend's bill.\r\nIndeed, I had no objection to the principle of the bill of last year. I\r\nhave long thought that the term of copyright ought to be extended. When\r\nMr Serjeant Talfourd moved for leave to bring in his bill, I did not\r\noppose the motion. Indeed I meant to vote for the second reading, and\r\nto reserve what I had to say for the Committee. But the learned Serjeant\r\nleft me no choice. He, in strong language, begged that nobody who was\r\ndisposed to reduce the term of sixty years would divide with him. \"Do\r\nnot,\" he said, \"give me your support, if all that you mean to grant to\r\nmen of letters is a miserable addition of fourteen or fifteen years to\r\nthe present term. I do not wish for such support. I despise it.\" Not\r\nwishing to obtrude on the learned Serjeant a support which he despised,\r\nI had no course left but to take the sense of the House on the second\r\nreading. The circumstances are now different. My noble friend's bill\r\nis not at present a good bill; but it may be improved into a very\r\ngood bill; nor will he, I am persuaded, withdraw it if it should be so\r\nimproved. He and I have the same object in view; but we differ as to the\r\nbest mode of attaining that object. We are equally desirous to extend\r\nthe protection now enjoyed by writers. In what way it may be extended\r\nwith most benefit to them and with least inconvenience to the public, is\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\nThe present state of the law is this. The author of a work has a certain\r\ncopyright in that work for a term of twenty-eight years. If he should\r\nlive more than twenty-eight years after the publication of the work, he\r\nretains the copyright to the end of his life.\r\n\r\nMy noble friend does not propose to make any addition to the term\r\nof twenty-eight years. But he proposes that the copyright shall last\r\ntwenty-five years after the author's death. Thus my noble friend makes\r\nno addition to that term which is certain, but makes a very large\r\naddition to that term which is uncertain.\r\n\r\nMy plan is different. I would made no addition to the uncertain term;\r\nbut I would make a large addition to the certain term. I propose to add\r\nfourteen years to the twenty-eight years which the law now allows to an\r\nauthor. His copyright will, in this way, last till his death, or till\r\nthe expiration of forty-two years, whichever shall first happen. And I\r\nthink that I shall be able to prove to the satisfaction of the Committee\r\nthat my plan will be more beneficial to literature and to literary men\r\nthan the plan of my noble friend.\r\n\r\nIt must surely, Sir, be admitted that the protection which we give to\r\nbooks ought to be distributed as evenly as possible, that every book\r\nshould have a fair share of that protection, and no book more than a\r\nfair share. It would evidently be absurd to put tickets into a wheel,\r\nwith different numbers marked upon them, and to make writers draw, one\r\na term of twenty-eight years, another a term of fifty, another a term of\r\nninety. And yet this sort of lottery is what my noble friend proposes to\r\nestablish. I know that we cannot altogether exclude chance. You have two\r\nterms of copyright; one certain, the other uncertain; and we cannot, I\r\nadmit, get rid of the uncertain term. It is proper, no doubt, that an\r\nauthor's copyright should last during his life. But, Sir, though we\r\ncannot altogether exclude chance, we can very much diminish the share\r\nwhich chance must have in distributing the recompense which we wish\r\nto give to genius and learning. By every addition which we make to the\r\ncertain term we diminish the influence of chance; by every addition\r\nwhich we make to the uncertain term we increase the influence of chance.\r\nI shall make myself best understood by putting cases. Take two eminent\r\nfemale writers, who died within our own memory, Madame D'Arblay and Miss\r\nAusten. As the law now stands, Miss Austen's charming novels would have\r\nonly from twenty-eight to thirty-three years of copyright. For that\r\nextraordinary woman died young: she died before her genius was fully\r\nappreciated by the world. Madame D'Arblay outlived the whole generation\r\nto which she belonged. The copyright of her celebrated novel, Evelina,\r\nlasted, under the present law, sixty-two years. Surely this inequality\r\nis sufficiently great--sixty-two years of copyright for Evelina, only\r\ntwenty-eight for Persuasion. But to my noble friend this inequality\r\nseems not great enough. He proposes to add twenty-five years to Madame\r\nD'Arblay's term, and not a single day to Miss Austen's term. He would\r\ngive to Persuasion a copyright of only twenty-eight years, as at\r\npresent, and to Evelina a copyright more than three times as long, a\r\ncopyright of eighty-seven years. Now, is this reasonable? See, on the\r\nother hand, the operation of my plan. I make no addition at all to\r\nMadame D'Arblay's term of sixty-two years, which is, in my opinion,\r\nquite long enough; but I extend Miss Austen's term to forty-two years,\r\nwhich is, in my opinion, not too much. You see, Sir, that at present\r\nchance has too much sway in this matter: that at present the protection\r\nwhich the State gives to letters is very unequally given. You see that\r\nif my noble friend's plan be adopted, more will be left to chance than\r\nunder the present system, and you will have such inequalities as are\r\nunknown under the present system. You see also that, under the system\r\nwhich I recommend, we shall have, not perfect certainty, not perfect\r\nequality, but much less uncertainty and inequality than at present.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. My noble friend's plan is not merely to institute\r\na lottery in which some writers will draw prizes and some will draw\r\nblanks. It is much worse than this. His lottery is so contrived that, in\r\nthe vast majority of cases, the blanks will fall to the best books, and\r\nthe prizes to books of inferior merit.\r\n\r\nTake Shakspeare. My noble friend gives a longer protection than I should\r\ngive to Love's Labour's Lost, and Pericles, Prince of Tyre; but he gives\r\na shorter protection than I should give to Othello and Macbeth.\r\n\r\nTake Milton. Milton died in 1674. The copyrights of Milton's great\r\nworks would, according to my noble friend's plan, expire in 1699. Comus\r\nappeared in 1634, the Paradise Lost in 1668. To Comus, then, my noble\r\nfriend would give sixty-five years of copyright, and to the Paradise\r\nLost only thirty-one years. Is that reasonable? Comus is a noble\r\npoem: but who would rank it with the Paradise Lost? My plan would give\r\nforty-two years both to the Paradise Lost and to Comus.\r\n\r\nLet us pass on from Milton to Dryden. My noble friend would give\r\nmore than sixty years of copyright to Dryden's worst works; to the\r\nencomiastic verses on Oliver Cromwell, to the Wild Gallant, to the Rival\r\nLadies, to other wretched pieces as bad as anything written by Flecknoe\r\nor Settle: but for Theodore and Honoria, for Tancred and Sigismunda, for\r\nCimon and Iphigenia, for Palamon and Arcite, for Alexander's Feast, my\r\nnoble friend thinks a copyright of twenty-eight years sufficient. Of\r\nall Pope's works, that to which my noble friend would give the largest\r\nmeasure of protection is the volume of Pastorals, remarkable only as the\r\nproduction of a boy. Johnson's first work was a Translation of a Book of\r\nTravels in Abyssinia, published in 1735. It was so poorly executed that\r\nin his later years he did not like to hear it mentioned. Boswell once\r\npicked up a copy of it, and told his friend that he had done so. \"Do not\r\ntalk about it,\" said Johnson: \"it is a thing to be forgotten.\" To this\r\nperformance my noble friend would give protection during the enormous\r\nterm of seventy-five years. To the Lives of the Poets he would give\r\nprotection during about thirty years. Well; take Henry Fielding; it\r\nmatters not whom I take, but take Fielding. His early works are read\r\nonly by the curious, and would not be read even by the curious, but for\r\nthe fame which he acquired in the latter part of his life by works of\r\na very different kind. What is the value of the Temple Beau, of the\r\nIntriguing Chambermaid, of half a dozen other plays of which few\r\ngentlemen have even heard the names? Yet to these worthless pieces my\r\nnoble friend would give a term of copyright longer by more than twenty\r\nyears than that which he would give to Tom Jones and Amelia.\r\n\r\nGo on to Burke. His little tract, entitled the Vindication of Natural\r\nSociety is certainly not without merit; but it would not be remembered\r\nin our days if it did not bear the name of Burke. To this tract my noble\r\nfriend would give a copyright of near seventy years. But to the great\r\nwork on the French Revolution, to the Appeal from the New to the Old\r\nWhigs, to the letters on the Regicide Peace, he would give a copyright\r\nof thirty years or little more.\r\n\r\nAnd, Sir observe that I am not selecting here and there extraordinary\r\ninstances in order to make up the semblance of a case. I am taking the\r\ngreatest names of our literature in chronological order. Go to other\r\nnations; go to remote ages; you will still find the general rule the\r\nsame. There was no copyright at Athens or Rome; but the history of the\r\nGreek and Latin literature illustrates my argument quite as well as if\r\ncopyright had existed in ancient times. Of all the plays of Sophocles,\r\nthe one to which the plan of my noble friend would have given the\r\nmost scanty recompense would have been that wonderful masterpiece, the\r\nOedipus at Colonos. Who would class together the Speech of Demosthenes\r\nagainst his Guardians, and the Speech for the Crown? My noble friend,\r\nindeed, would not class them together. For to the Speech against the\r\nGuardians he would give a copyright of near seventy years, and to the\r\nincomparable Speech for the Crown a copyright of less than half that\r\nlength. Go to Rome. My noble friend would give more than twice as long a\r\nterm to Cicero's juvenile declamation in defence of Roscius Amerinus as\r\nto the Second Philippic. Go to France. My noble friend would give a far\r\nlonger term to Racine's Freres Ennemis than to Athalie, and to Moliere's\r\nEtourdi than to Tartuffe. Go to Spain. My noble friend would give a\r\nlonger term to forgotten works of Cervantes, works which nobody now\r\nreads, than to Don Quixote. Go to Germany. According to my noble\r\nfriend's plan, of all the works of Schiller the Robbers would be the\r\nmost favoured: of all the works of Goethe, the Sorrows of Werter would\r\nbe the most favoured. I thank the Committee for listening so kindly to\r\nthis long enumeration. Gentlemen will perceive, I am sure, that it is\r\nnot from pedantry that I mention the names of so many books and authors.\r\nBut just as, in our debates on civil affairs, we constantly draw\r\nillustrations from civil history, we must, in a debate about literary\r\nproperty, draw our illustrations from literary history. Now, Sir, I\r\nhave, I think, shown from literary history that the effect of my\r\nnoble friend's plan would be to give to crude and imperfect works, to\r\nthird-rate and fourth-rate works, a great advantage over the highest\r\nproductions of genius. It is impossible to account for the facts which I\r\nhave laid before you by attributing them to mere accident. Their number\r\nis too great, their character too uniform. We must seek for some other\r\nexplanation; and we shall easily find one.\r\n\r\nIt is the law of our nature that the mind shall attain its full power\r\nby slow degrees; and this is especially true of the most vigorous minds.\r\nYoung men, no doubt, have often produced works of great merit; but it\r\nwould be impossible to name any writer of the first order whose juvenile\r\nperformances were his best. That all the most valuable books of history,\r\nof philology, of physical and metaphysical science, of divinity, of\r\npolitical economy, have been produced by men of mature years will hardly\r\nbe disputed. The case may not be quite so clear as respects works of\r\nthe imagination. And yet I know no work of the imagination of the very\r\nhighest class that was ever, in any age or country, produced by a\r\nman under thirty-five. Whatever powers a youth may have received from\r\nnature, it is impossible that his taste and judgment can be ripe, that\r\nhis mind can be richly stored with images, that he can have observed\r\nthe vicissitudes of life, that he can have studied the nicer shades of\r\ncharacter. How, as Marmontel very sensibly said, is a person to paint\r\nportraits who has never seen faces? On the whole, I believe that I may,\r\nwithout fear of contradiction, affirm this, that of the good books now\r\nextant in the world more than nineteen-twentieths were published after\r\nthe writers had attained the age of forty. If this be so, it is evident\r\nthat the plan of my noble friend is framed on a vicious principle. For,\r\nwhile he gives to juvenile productions a very much larger protection\r\nthan they now enjoy, he does comparatively little for the works of men\r\nin the full maturity of their powers, and absolutely nothing for any\r\nwork which is published during the last three years of the life of the\r\nwriter. For, by the existing law, the copyright of such a work lasts\r\ntwenty-eight years from the publication; and my noble friend gives only\r\ntwenty-five years, to be reckoned from the writer's death.\r\n\r\nWhat I recommend is that the certain term, reckoned from the date of\r\npublication, shall be forty-two years instead of twenty-eight years. In\r\nthis arrangement there is no uncertainty, no inequality. The advantage\r\nwhich I propose to give will be the same to every book. No work will\r\nhave so long a copyright as my noble friend gives to some books, or so\r\nshort a copyright as he gives to others. No copyright will last ninety\r\nyears. No copyright will end in twenty-eight years. To every book\r\npublished in the course of the last seventeen years of a writer's life\r\nI give a longer term of copyright than my noble friend gives; and I\r\nam confident that no person versed in literary history will deny\r\nthis,--that in general the most valuable works of an author are\r\npublished in the course of the last seventeen years of his life. I will\r\nrapidly enumerate a few, and but a few, of the great works of English\r\nwriters to which my plan is more favourable than my noble friend's plan.\r\nTo Lear, to Macbeth, to Othello, to the Fairy Queen, to the Paradise\r\nLost, to Bacon's Novum Organum and De Augmentis, to Locke's Essay on\r\nthe Human Understanding, to Clarendon's History, to Hume's History, to\r\nGibbon's History, to Smith's Wealth of Nations, to Addison's Spectators,\r\nto almost all the great works of Burke, to Clarissa and Sir Charles\r\nGrandison, to Joseph Andrews, Tom Jones and Amelia, and, with the single\r\nexception of Waverley, to all the novels of Sir Walter Scott, I give a\r\nlonger term of copyright than my noble friend gives. Can he match that\r\nlist? Does not that list contain what England has produced greatest in\r\nmany various ways--poetry, philosophy, history, eloquence, wit, skilful\r\nportraiture of life and manners? I confidently therefore call on the\r\nCommittee to take my plan in preference to the plan of my noble friend.\r\nI have shown that the protection which he proposes to give to letters is\r\nunequal, and unequal in the worst way. I have shown that his plan is to\r\ngive protection to books in inverse proportion to their merit. I shall\r\nmove when we come to the third clause of the bill to omit the words\r\n\"twenty-five years,\" and in a subsequent part of the same clause I\r\nshall move to substitute for the words \"twenty-eight years\" the words\r\n\"forty-two years.\" I earnestly hope that the Committee will adopt these\r\namendments; and I feel the firmest conviction that my noble friend's\r\nbill, so amended, will confer a great boon on men of letters with the\r\nsmallest possible inconvenience to the public.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEOPLE'S CHARTER. (MAY 3, 1842) A SPEECH DELIVERED IN THE HOUSE OF\r\nCOMMONS ON THE THIRD OF MAY 1842.\r\n\r\nOn the second of May 1842, Mr Thomas Duncombe, Member for Finsbury,\r\npresented a petition, very numerously signed, of which the prayer was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"Your petitioners, therefore, exercising their just constitutional\r\nright, demand that your Honourable House, to remedy the many gross\r\nand manifest evils of which your petitioners complain, do immediately,\r\nwithout alteration, deduction, or addition, pass into a law the document\r\nentitled the People's Charter.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following day Mr Thomas Duncombe moved that the petitioners\r\nshould be heard by themselves or their Counsel at the Bar of the House.\r\nThe following Speech was made in opposition to the motion.\r\n\r\nThe motion was rejected by 287 votes to 49.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker,--I was particularly desirous to catch your eye this evening,\r\nbecause, when the motion of the honourable Member of Rochdale (Mr\r\nSharman Crawford.) was under discussion, I was unable to be in my place.\r\nI understand that, on that occasion, the absence of some members of\r\nthe late Government was noticed in severe terms, and was attributed to\r\ndiscreditable motives. As for myself, Sir, I was prevented from coming\r\ndown to the House by illness: a noble friend of mine, to whom particular\r\nallusion was made, was detained elsewhere by pure accident; and I am\r\nconvinced that no member of the late administration was withheld by any\r\nunworthy feeling from avowing his opinions. My own opinions I could have\r\nno motive for disguising. They have been frequently avowed, and avowed\r\nbefore audiences which were not likely to regard them with much favour.\r\n\r\nI should wish, Sir, to say what I have to say in the temperate tone\r\nwhich has with so much propriety been preserved by the right honourable\r\nBaronet the Secretary for the Home Department (Sir James Graham.);\r\nbut, if I should use any warm expression, I trust that the House will\r\nattribute it to the strength of my convictions and to my solicitude\r\nfor the public interests. No person who knows me will, I am quite sure,\r\nsuspect me of regarding the hundreds of thousands who have signed the\r\npetition which we are now considering, with any other feeling than\r\ncordial goodwill.\r\n\r\nSir, I cannot conscientiously assent to this motion. And yet I must\r\nadmit that the honourable Member for Finsbury (Mr Thomas Duncombe.) has\r\nframed it with considerable skill. He has done his best to obtain the\r\nsupport of all those timid and interested politicians who think much\r\nmore about the security of their seats than about the security of their\r\ncountry. It would be very convenient to me to give a silent vote with\r\nhim. I should then have it in my power to say to the Chartists of\r\nEdinburgh, \"When your petition was before the House I was on your side:\r\nI was for giving you a full hearing.\" I should at the same time be able\r\nto assure my Conservative constituents that I never had supported and\r\nnever would support the Charter. But, Sir, though this course would be\r\nvery convenient, it is one which my sense of duty will not suffer me\r\nto take. When questions of private right are before us, we hear, and\r\nwe ought to hear, the arguments of the parties interested in those\r\nquestions. But it has never been, and surely it ought not to be, our\r\npractice to grant a hearing to persons who petition for or against a law\r\nin which they have no other interest than that which is common between\r\nthem and the whole nation. Of the many who petitioned against slavery,\r\nagainst the Roman Catholic claims, against the corn laws, none was\r\nsuffered to harangue us at the bar in support of his views. If in the\r\npresent case we depart from a general rule which everybody must admit to\r\nbe a very wholesome one, what inference can reasonably be drawn from\r\nour conduct, except this, that we think the petition which we are now\r\nconsidering entitled to extraordinary respect, and that we have not\r\nfully made up our minds to refuse what the petitioners ask? Now, Sir, I\r\nhave fully made up my mind to resist to the last the change which they\r\nurge us to make in the constitution of the kingdom. I therefore think\r\nthat I should act disingenuously if I gave my voice for calling in\r\norators whose eloquence, I am certain, will make no alteration in my\r\nopinion. I think too that if, after voting for hearing the petitioners,\r\nI should then vote against granting their prayer, I should give them\r\njust ground for accusing me of having first encouraged and then deserted\r\nthem. That accusation, at least, they shall never bring against me.\r\n\r\nThe honourable Member for Westminster (Mr Leader.) has expressed a\r\nhope that the language of the petition will not be subjected to severe\r\ncriticism. If he means literary criticism, I entirely agree with him.\r\nThe style of this composition is safe from any censure of mine; but the\r\nsubstance it is absolutely necessary that we should closely examine.\r\nWhat the petitioners demand is this, that we do forthwith pass what is\r\ncalled the People's Charter into a law without alteration, diminution,\r\nor addition. This is the prayer in support of which the honourable\r\nMember for Finsbury would have us hear an argument at the bar. Is it\r\nthen reasonable to say, as some gentlemen have said, that, in voting for\r\nthe honourable Member's motion, they mean to vote merely for an inquiry\r\ninto the causes of the public distress? If any gentleman thinks that an\r\ninquiry into the causes of the public distress would be useful, let him\r\nmove for such an inquiry. I will not oppose it. But this petition does\r\nnot tell us to inquire. It tells us that we are not to inquire. It\r\ndirects us to pass a certain law word for word, and to pass it without\r\nthe smallest delay.\r\n\r\nI shall, Sir, notwithstanding the request or command of the petitioners,\r\nventure to exercise my right of free speech on the subject of the\r\nPeople's Charter. There is, among the six points of the Charter, one for\r\nwhich I have voted. There is another of which I decidedly approve. There\r\nare others as to which, though I do not agree with the petitioners, I\r\ncould go some way to meet them. In fact, there is only one of the six\r\npoints on which I am diametrically opposed to them: but unfortunately\r\nthat point happens to be infinitely the most important of the six.\r\n\r\nOne of the six points is the ballot. I have voted for the ballot; and I\r\nhave seen no reason to change my opinion on that subject.\r\n\r\nAnother point is the abolition of the pecuniary qualification for\r\nmembers of this House. On that point I cordially agree with the\r\npetitioners. You have established a sufficient pecuniary qualification\r\nfor the elector; and it therefore seems to me quite superfluous to\r\nrequire a pecuniary qualification from the representative. Everybody\r\nknows that many English members have only fictitious qualifications, and\r\nthat the members for Scotch cities and boroughs are not required to\r\nhave any qualification at all. It is surely absurd to admit the\r\nrepresentatives of Edinburgh and Glasgow without any qualification, and\r\nat the same time to require the representative of Finsbury or Marylebone\r\nto possess a qualification or the semblance of one. If the qualification\r\nreally be a security for respectability, let that security be\r\ndemanded from us who sit here for Scotch towns. If, as I believe, the\r\nqualification is no security at all, why should we require it from\r\nanybody? It is no part of the old constitution of the realm. It was\r\nfirst established in the reign of Anne. It was established by a bad\r\nparliament for a bad purpose. It was, in fact, part of a course of\r\nlegislation which, if it had not been happily interrupted, would have\r\nended in the repeal of the Toleration Act and of the Act of Settlement.\r\n\r\nThe Chartists demand annual parliaments. There, certainly, I differ from\r\nthem; but I might, perhaps, be willing to consent to some compromise. I\r\ndiffer from them also as to the expediency of paying the representatives\r\nof the people, and of dividing the country into electoral districts.\r\nBut I do not consider these matters as vital. The kingdom might, I\r\nacknowledge, be free, great, and happy, though the members of this house\r\nreceived salaries, and though the present boundaries of counties and\r\nboroughs were superseded by new lines of demarcation. These, Sir,\r\nare subordinate questions. I do not of course mean that they are not\r\nimportant. But they are subordinate when compared with that question\r\nwhich still remains to be considered. The essence of the Charter is\r\nuniversal suffrage. If you withhold that, it matters not very much what\r\nelse you grant. If you grant that, it matters not at all what else you\r\nwithhold. If you grant that, the country is lost.\r\n\r\nI have no blind attachment to ancient usages. I altogether disclaim what\r\nhas been nicknamed the doctrine of finality. I have said enough to-night\r\nto show that I do not consider the settlement made by the Reform Bill\r\nas one which can last for ever. I certainly do think that an extensive\r\nchange in the polity of a nation must be attended with serious evils.\r\nStill those evils may be overbalanced by advantages: and I am perfectly\r\nready, in every case, to weigh the evils against the advantages, and to\r\njudge as well as I can which scale preponderates. I am bound by no tie\r\nto oppose any reform which I think likely to promote the public good. I\r\nwill go so far as to say that I do not quite agree with those who think\r\nthat they have proved the People's Charter to be absurd when they have\r\nproved that it is incompatible with the existence of the throne and\r\nof the peerage. For, though I am a faithful and loyal subject of Her\r\nMajesty, and though I sincerely wish to see the House of Lords powerful\r\nand respected, I cannot consider either monarchy or aristocracy as the\r\nends of government. They are only means. Nations have flourished without\r\nhereditary sovereigns or assemblies of nobles; and, though I should be\r\nvery sorry to see England a republic, I do not doubt that she might, as\r\na republic, enjoy prosperity, tranquillity, and high consideration.\r\nThe dread and aversion with which I regard universal suffrage would be\r\ngreatly diminished, if I could believe that the worst effect which it\r\nwould produce would be to give us an elective first magistrate and a\r\nsenate instead of a Queen and a House of Peers. My firm conviction is\r\nthat, in our country, universal suffrage is incompatible, not with this\r\nor that form of government, but with all forms of government, and with\r\neverything for the sake of which forms of government exist; that it is\r\nincompatible with property, and that it is consequently incompatible\r\nwith civilisation.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary for me in this place to go through the arguments\r\nwhich prove beyond dispute that on the security of property civilisation\r\ndepends; that, where property is insecure, no climate however delicious,\r\nno soil however fertile, no conveniences for trade and navigation, no\r\nnatural endowments of body or of mind, can prevent a nation from sinking\r\ninto barbarism; that where, on the other hand, men are protected in\r\nthe enjoyment of what has been created by their industry and laid up\r\nby their self-denial, society will advance in arts and in wealth\r\nnotwithstanding the sterility of the earth and the inclemency of the\r\nair, notwithstanding heavy taxes and destructive wars. Those persons who\r\nsay that England has been greatly misgoverned, that her legislation is\r\ndefective, that her wealth has been squandered in unjust and impolitic\r\ncontests with America and with France, do in fact bear the strongest\r\ntestimony to the truth of my doctrine. For that our country has made and\r\nis making great progress in all that contributes to the material comfort\r\nof man is indisputable. If that progress cannot be ascribed to\r\nthe wisdom of the Government, to what can we ascribe it but to the\r\ndiligence, the energy, the thrift of individuals? And to what can we\r\nascribe that diligence, that energy, that thrift, except to the security\r\nwhich property has during many generations enjoyed here? Such is the\r\npower of this great principle that, even in the last war, the most\r\ncostly war, beyond all comparison, that ever was waged in this world,\r\nthe Government could not lavish wealth so fast as the productive classes\r\ncreated it.\r\n\r\nIf it be admitted that on the institution of property the wellbeing\r\nof society depends, it follows surely that it would be madness to give\r\nsupreme power in the state to a class which would not be likely to\r\nrespect that institution. And, if this be conceded, it seems to me to\r\nfollow that it would be madness to grant the prayer of this petition. I\r\nentertain no hope that, if we place the government of the kingdom in the\r\nhands of the majority of the males of one-and-twenty told by the head,\r\nthe institution of property will be respected. If I am asked why I\r\nentertain no such hope, I answer, because the hundreds of thousands of\r\nmales of twenty-one who have signed this petition tell me to entertain\r\nno such hope; because they tell me that, if I trust them with power, the\r\nfirst use which they will make of it will be to plunder every man in the\r\nkingdom who has a good coat on his back and a good roof over his head.\r\nGod forbid that I should put an unfair construction on their language!\r\nI will read their own words. This petition, be it remembered, is an\r\nauthoritative declaration of the wishes of those who, if the Charter\r\never becomes law, will return the great majority of the House of\r\nCommons; and these are their words: \"Your petitioners complain, that\r\nthey are enormously taxed to pay the interest of what is called the\r\nnational debt, a debt amounting at present to eight hundred millions,\r\nbeing only a portion of the enormous amount expended in cruel and\r\nexpensive wars for the suppression of all liberty by men not authorised\r\nby the people, and who consequently had no right to tax posterity\r\nfor the outrages committed by them upon mankind.\" If these words mean\r\nanything, they mean that the present generation is not bound to pay the\r\npublic debt incurred by our rulers in past times, and that a national\r\nbankruptcy would be both just and politic. For my part, I believe it to\r\nbe impossible to make any distinction between the right of a fundholder\r\nto his dividends and the right of a landowner to his rents. And, to do\r\nthe petitioners justice, I must say that they seem to be much of the\r\nsame mind. They are for dealing with fundholder and landowner alike.\r\nThey tell us that nothing will \"unshackle labour from its misery, until\r\nthe people possess that power under which all monopoly and oppression\r\nmust cease; and your petitioners respectfully mention the existing\r\nmonopolies of the suffrage, of paper money, of machinery, of land, of\r\nthe public press, of religion, of the means of travelling and transit,\r\nand a host of other evils too numerous to mention, all arising from\r\nclass legislation.\" Absurd as this hubbub of words is, part of it is\r\nintelligible enough. What can the monopoly of land mean, except property\r\nin land? The only monopoly of land which exists in England is this, that\r\nnobody can sell an acre of land which does not belong to him. And what\r\ncan the monopoly of machinery mean but property in machinery? Another\r\nmonopoly which is to cease is the monopoly of the means of travelling.\r\nIn other words all the canal property and railway property in the\r\nkingdom is to be confiscated. What other sense do the words bear? And\r\nthese are only specimens of the reforms which, in the language of the\r\npetition, are to unshackle labour from its misery. There remains,\r\nit seems, a host of similar monopolies too numerous to mention; the\r\nmonopoly I presume, which a draper has of his own stock of cloth; the\r\nmonopoly which a hatter has of his own stock of hats; the monopoly\r\nwhich we all have of our furniture, bedding, and clothes. In short, the\r\npetitioners ask you to give them power in order that they may not leave\r\na man of a hundred a year in the realm.\r\n\r\nI am far from wishing to throw any blame on the ignorant crowds which\r\nhave flocked to the tables where this petition was exhibited. Nothing\r\nis more natural than that the labouring people should be deceived by the\r\narts of such men as the author of this absurd and wicked composition.\r\nWe ourselves, with all our advantages of education, are often very\r\ncredulous, very impatient, very shortsighted, when we are tried by\r\npecuniary distress or bodily pain. We often resort to means of immediate\r\nrelief which, as Reason tells us, if we would listen to her, are certain\r\nto aggravate our sufferings. Men of great abilities and knowledge have\r\nruined their estates and their constitutions in this way. How then\r\ncan we wonder that men less instructed than ourselves, and tried by\r\nprivations such as we have never known, should be easily misled\r\nby mountebanks who promise impossibilities? Imagine a well-meaning\r\nlaborious mechanic, fondly attached to his wife and children. Bad times\r\ncome. He sees the wife whom he loves grow thinner and paler every day.\r\nHis little ones cry for bread, and he has none to give them. Then come\r\nthe professional agitators, the tempters, and tell him that there is\r\nenough and more than enough for everybody, and that he has too little\r\nonly because landed gentlemen, fundholders, bankers, manufacturers,\r\nrailway proprietors, shopkeepers have too much. Is it strange that the\r\npoor man should be deluded, and should eagerly sign such a petition as\r\nthis? The inequality with which wealth is distributed forces itself\r\non everybody's notice. It is at once perceived by the eye. The reasons\r\nwhich irrefragably prove this inequality to be necessary to the\r\nwellbeing of all classes are not equally obvious. Our honest working man\r\nhas not received such an education as enables him to understand that the\r\nutmost distress that he has ever known is prosperity when compared with\r\nthe distress which he would have to endure if there were a single month\r\nof general anarchy and plunder. But you say, it is not the fault of the\r\nlabourer that he is not well educated. Most true. It is not his fault.\r\nBut, though he has no share in the fault, he will, if you are foolish\r\nenough to give him supreme power in the state, have a very large share\r\nof the punishment. You say that, if the Government had not culpably\r\nomitted to establish a good system of public instruction, the\r\npetitioners would have been fit for the elective franchise. But is that\r\na reason for giving them the franchise when their own petition proves\r\nthat they are not fit for it; when they give us fair notice that, if we\r\nlet them have it, they will use it to our ruin and their own? It is not\r\nnecessary now to inquire whether, with universal education, we could\r\nsafely have universal suffrage. What we are asked to do is to give\r\nuniversal suffrage before there is universal education. Have I any\r\nunkind feeling towards these poor people? No more than I have to a\r\nsick friend who implores me to give him a glass of iced water which the\r\nphysician has forbidden. No more than a humane collector in India has\r\nto those poor peasants who in a season of scarcity crowd round the\r\ngranaries and beg with tears and piteous gestures that the doors may be\r\nopened and the rice distributed. I would not give the draught of water,\r\nbecause I know that it would be poison. I would not give up the keys of\r\nthe granary, because I know that, by doing so, I should turn a scarcity\r\ninto a famine. And in the same way I would not yield to the importunity\r\nof multitudes who, exasperated by suffering and blinded by ignorance,\r\ndemand with wild vehemence the liberty to destroy themselves.\r\n\r\nBut it is said, You must not attach so much importance to this petition.\r\nIt is very foolish, no doubt, and disgraceful to the author, be he who\r\nhe may. But you must not suppose that those who signed it approve of\r\nit. They have merely put their names or their marks without weighing the\r\nsense of the document which they subscribed. Surely, Sir, of all reasons\r\nthat ever were given for receiving a petition with peculiar honours, the\r\nstrangest is that it expresses sentiments diametrically opposed to\r\nthe real sentiments of those who have signed it. And it is a not less\r\nstrange reason for giving men supreme power in a state that they sign\r\npolitical manifestoes of the highest importance without taking the\r\ntrouble to know what the contents are. But how is it possible for us to\r\nbelieve that, if the petitioners had the power which they demand,\r\nthey would not use it as they threaten? During a long course of years,\r\nnumerous speakers and writers, some of them ignorant, others dishonest,\r\nhave been constantly representing the Government as able to do, and\r\nbound to do, things which no Government can, without great injury to the\r\ncountry, attempt to do. Every man of sense knows that the people support\r\nthe Government. But the doctrine of the Chartist philosophers is that it\r\nis the business of the Government to support the people. It is supposed\r\nby many that our rulers possess, somewhere or other, an inexhaustible\r\nstorehouse of all the necessaries and conveniences of life, and, from\r\nmere hardheartedness, refuse to distribute the contents of this magazine\r\namong the poor. We have all of us read speeches and tracts in which it\r\nseemed to be taken for granted that we who sit here have the power of\r\nworking miracles, of sending a shower of manna on the West Riding,\r\nof striking the earth and furnishing all the towns of Lancashire with\r\nabundance of pure water, of feeding all the cotton-spinners and weavers\r\nwho are out of work with five loaves and two fishes. There is not a\r\nworking man who has not heard harangues and read newspapers in which\r\nthese follies are taught. And do you believe that as soon as you give\r\nthe working men absolute and irresistible power they will forget all\r\nthis? Yes, Sir, absolute and irresistible power. The Charter would\r\ngive them no less. In every constituent body throughout the empire\r\nthe working men will, if we grant the prayer of this petition, be an\r\nirresistible majority. In every constituent body capital will be placed\r\nat the feet of labour; knowledge will be borne down by ignorance; and is\r\nit possible to doubt what the result must be? The honourable Member for\r\nBath and the honourable Member for Rochdale are now considered as very\r\ndemocratic members of Parliament. They would occupy a very different\r\nposition in a House of Commons elected by universal suffrage, if they\r\nsucceeded in obtaining seats. They would, I believe, honestly oppose\r\nevery attempt to rob the public creditor. They would manfully say,\r\n\"Justice and the public good require that this sum of thirty millions\r\na year should be paid;\" and they would immediately be reviled as\r\naristocrats, monopolists, oppressors of the poor, defenders of old\r\nabuses. And as to land, is it possible to believe that the millions who\r\nhave been so long and loudly told that the land is their estate, and is\r\nwrongfully kept from them, should not, when they have supreme power, use\r\nthat power to enforce what they think their rights? What could follow\r\nbut one vast spoliation? One vast spoliation! That would be bad enough.\r\nThat would be the greatest calamity that ever fell on our country. Yet\r\nwould that a single vast spoliation were the worst! No, Sir; in the\r\nlowest deep there would be a lower deep. The first spoliation would not\r\nbe the last. How could it? All the causes which had produced the first\r\nspoliation would still operate. They would operate more powerfully than\r\nbefore. The distress would be far greater than before. The fences which\r\nnow protect property would all have been broken through, levelled, swept\r\naway. The new proprietors would have no title to show to anything that\r\nthey held except recent robbery. With what face then could they complain\r\nof being robbed? What would be the end of these things? Our experience,\r\nGod be praised, does not enable us to predict it with certainty. We can\r\nonly guess. My guess is that we should see something more horrible than\r\ncan be imagined--something like the siege of Jerusalem on a far larger\r\nscale. There would be many millions of human beings, crowded in a narrow\r\nspace, deprived of all those resources which alone had made it possible\r\nfor them to exist in so narrow a space; trade gone; manufactures gone;\r\ncredit gone. What could they do but fight for the mere sustenance\r\nof nature, and tear each other to pieces till famine, and pestilence\r\nfollowing in the train of famine, came to turn the terrible commotion\r\ninto a more terrible repose? The best event, the very best event, that I\r\ncan anticipate,--and what must the state of things be, if an Englishman\r\nand a Whig calls such an event the very best?--the very best event,\r\nI say, that I can anticipate is that out of the confusion a strong\r\nmilitary despotism may arise, and that the sword, firmly grasped by some\r\nrough hand, may give a sort of protection to the miserable wreck of all\r\nthat immense prosperity and glory. But, as to the noble institutions\r\nunder which our country has made such progress in liberty, in wealth,\r\nin knowledge, in arts, do not deceive yourselves into the belief that\r\nwe should ever see them again. We should never see them again. We should\r\nnot deserve to see them. All those nations which envy our greatness\r\nwould insult our downfall, a downfall which would be all our own work;\r\nand the history of our calamities would be told thus: England had\r\ninstitutions which, though imperfect, yet contained within themselves\r\nthe means of remedying every imperfection; those institutions her\r\nlegislators wantonly and madly threw away; nor could they urge in their\r\nexcuse even the wretched plea that they were deceived by false promises;\r\nfor, in the very petition with the prayer of which they were weak enough\r\nto comply, they were told, in the plainest terms, that public ruin would\r\nbe the effect of their compliance.\r\n\r\nThinking thus, Sir, I will oppose, with every faculty which God has\r\ngiven me, every motion which directly or indirectly tends to the\r\ngranting of universal suffrage. This motion I think, tends that way.\r\nIf any gentleman here is prepared to vote for universal suffrage with a\r\nfull view of all the consequences of universal suffrage as they are set\r\nforth in this petition, he acts with perfect consistency in voting for\r\nthis motion. But, I must say, I heard with some surprise the honourable\r\nbaronet the Member for Leicester (Sir John Easthope.) say that, though\r\nhe utterly disapproves of the petition, though he thinks of it just as\r\nI do, he wishes the petitioners to be heard at the bar in explanation\r\nof their opinions. I conceive that their opinions are quite sufficiently\r\nexplained already; and to such opinions I am not disposed to pay any\r\nextraordinary mark of respect. I shall give a clear and conscientious\r\nvote against the motion of the honourable Member for Finsbury; and I\r\nconceive that the petitioners will have much less reason to complain\r\nof my open hostility than of the conduct of the honourable Member, who\r\ntries to propitiate them by consenting to hear their oratory, but has\r\nfully made up his mind not to comply with their demands.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GATES OF SOMNAUTH. (MARCH 9, 1843) A SPEECH DELIVERED IN THE HOUSE\r\nOF COMMONS ON THE 9TH OF MARCH 1843.\r\n\r\nOn the ninth of March 1843, Mr Vernon Smith, Member for Northampton,\r\nmade the following motion:\r\n\r\n\"That this House, having regard to the high and important functions\r\nof the Governor General of India, the mixed character of the native\r\npopulation, and the recent measures of the Court of Directors for\r\ndiscontinuing any seeming sanction to idolatry in India, is of opinion\r\nthat the conduct of Lord Ellenborough in issuing the General Orders of\r\nthe sixteenth of November 1842, and in addressing the letter of the same\r\ndate to all the chiefs, princes, and people of India, respecting the\r\nrestoration of the gates of a temple to Somnauth, is unwise, indecorous,\r\nand reprehensible.\"\r\n\r\nMr Emerson Tennent, Secretary of the Board of Control, opposed the\r\nmotion. In reply to him the following Speech was made.\r\n\r\nThe motion was rejected by 242 votes to 157.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker,--If the practice of the honourable gentleman, the Secretary\r\nof the Board of Control, had been in accordance with his precepts, if he\r\nhad not, after exhorting us to confine ourselves strictly to the subject\r\nbefore us, rambled far from that subject, I should have refrained from\r\nall digression. For and truth there is abundance to be said touching\r\nboth the substance and the style of this Proclamation. I cannot,\r\nhowever, leave the honourable gentleman's peroration entirely unnoticed.\r\nBut I assure him that I do not mean to wander from the question before\r\nus to any great distance or for any long time.\r\n\r\nI cannot but wonder, Sir, that he who has, on this, as on former\r\noccasions, exhibited so much ability and acuteness, should have gravely\r\nrepresented it as a ground of complaint, that my right honourable\r\nfriend the Member for Northampton has made this motion in the Governor\r\nGeneral's absence. Does the honourable gentleman mean that this House\r\nis to be interdicted from ever considering in what manner Her Majesty's\r\nAsiatic subjects, a hundred millions in number, are governed? And how\r\ncan we consider how they are governed without considering the conduct\r\nof him who is governing them? And how can we consider the conduct of him\r\nwho is governing them, except in his absence? For my own part, I can say\r\nfor myself, and I may, I doubt not, say for my right honourable friend\r\nthe Member for Northampton, that we both of us wish, with all our hearts\r\nand souls, that we were discussing this question in the presence of\r\nLord Ellenborough. Would to heaven, Sir, for the sake of the credit of\r\nEngland, and of the interests of India, that the noble lord were at this\r\nmoment under our gallery! But, Sir, if there be any Governor who has\r\nno right to complain of remarks made on him in his absence, it is that\r\nGovernor who, forgetting all official decorum, forgetting how important\r\nit is that, while the individuals who serve the State are changed, the\r\nState should preserve its identity, inserted in a public proclamation\r\nreflections on his predecessor, a predecessor of whom, on the present\r\noccasion, I will only say that his conduct had deserved a very different\r\nreturn. I am confident that no enemy of Lord Auckland, if Lord Auckland\r\nhas an enemy in the House, will deny that, whatever faults he may\r\nhave committed, he was faultless with respect to Lord Ellenborough. No\r\nbrother could have laboured more assiduously for the interests and\r\nthe honour of a brother than Lord Auckland laboured to facilitate Lord\r\nEllenborough's arduous task, to prepare for Lord Ellenborough the\r\nmeans of obtaining success and glory. And what was the requital? A\r\nproclamation by Lord Ellenborough, stigmatising the conduct of Lord\r\nAuckland. And, Sir, since the honourable gentleman the Secretary of the\r\nBoard of Control has thought fit to divert the debate from its proper\r\ncourse, I will venture to request that he, or the honourable director\r\nwho sits behind him (Sir James Hogg.), will vouchsafe to give us some\r\nexplanations on an important point to which allusion has been made.\r\nLord Ellenborough has been accused of having publicly announced that our\r\ntroops were about to evacuate Afghanistan before he had ascertained that\r\nour captive countrymen and countrywomen had been restored to liberty.\r\nThis accusation, which is certainly a serious one, the honourable\r\ngentleman, the Secretary of the Board of Control, pronounces to be a\r\nmere calumny. Now, Sir, the proclamation which announces the withdrawing\r\nof the troops bears date the first of October 1842. What I wish to know\r\nis, whether any member of the Government, or of the Court of Directors,\r\nwill venture to affirm that on the first of October 1842, the Governor\r\nGeneral knew that the prisoners had been set at liberty? I believe that\r\nno member either of the Government or of the Court of Directors will\r\nventure to affirm any such thing. It seems certain that on the first\r\nof October the Governor General could not know that the prisoners were\r\nsafe. Nevertheless, the honourable gentleman the Secretary of the Board\r\nof Control assures us that, when the proclamation was drawn up, the\r\nGovernor General did know that the prisoners were safe. What is the\r\ninevitable consequence? It is this, that the date is a false date, that\r\nthe proclamation was written after the first of October, and antedated?\r\nAnd for what reason was it antedated? I am almost ashamed to tell\r\nthe House what I believe to have been the reason. I believe that Lord\r\nEllenborough affixed the false date of the first of October to his\r\nproclamation because Lord Auckland's manifesto against Afghanistan was\r\ndated on the first of October. I believe that Lord Ellenborough wished\r\nto make the contrast between his own success and his predecessor's\r\nfailure more striking, and that for the sake of this paltry, this\r\nchildish, triumph, he antedated his proclamation, and made it appear to\r\nall Europe and all Asia that the English Government was indifferent\r\nto the fate of Englishmen and Englishwomen who were in a miserable\r\ncaptivity. If this be so, and I shall be surprised to hear any person\r\ndeny that it is so, I must say that by this single act, by writing those\r\nwords, the first of October, the Governor General proved himself to be a\r\nman of an ill-regulated mind, a man unfit for high public trust.\r\n\r\nI might, Sir, if I chose to follow the example of the honourable\r\ngentleman the Secretary of the Board of Control, advert to many other\r\nmatters. I might call the attention of the House to the systematic\r\nmanner in which the Governor General has exerted himself to lower\r\nthe character and to break the spirit of that civil service on the\r\nrespectability and efficiency of which chiefly depends the happiness of\r\na hundred millions of human beings. I might say much about the financial\r\ncommittee which he appointed in the hope of finding out blunders of his\r\npredecessor, but which at last found out no blunders except his own.\r\nBut the question before us demands our attention. That question has two\r\nsides, a serious and a ludicrous side. Let us look first at the serious\r\nside. Sir, I disclaim in the strongest manner all intention of raising\r\nany fanatical outcry or of lending aid to any fanatical project. I would\r\nvery much rather be the victim of fanaticism than its tool. If Lord\r\nEllenborough were called in question for having given an impartial\r\nprotection to the professors of different religions, or for restraining\r\nunjustifiable excesses into which Christian missionaries might have been\r\nhurried by their zeal, I would, widely as I have always differed from\r\nhim in politics, have stood up in his defence, though I had stood up\r\nalone. But the charge against Lord Ellenborough is that he has insulted\r\nthe religion of his own country and the religion of millions of the\r\nQueen's Asiatic subjects in order to pay honour to an idol. And this the\r\nright honourable gentleman the Secretary of the Board of Control calls a\r\ntrivial charge. Sir, I think it a very grave charge. Her Majesty is the\r\nruler of a larger heathen population than the world ever saw collected\r\nunder the sceptre of a Christian sovereign since the days of the Emperor\r\nTheodosius. What the conduct of rulers in such circumstances ought to be\r\nis one of the most important moral questions, one of the most important\r\npolitical questions, that it is possible to conceive. There are subject\r\nto the British rule in Asia a hundred millions of people who do not\r\nprofess the Christian faith. The Mahometans are a minority: but their\r\nimportance is much more than proportioned to their number: for they are\r\nan united, a zealous, an ambitious, a warlike class. The great majority\r\nof the population of India consists of idolaters, blindly attached\r\nto doctrines and rites which, considered merely with reference to the\r\ntemporal interests of mankind, are in the highest degree pernicious. In\r\nno part of the world has a religion ever existed more unfavourable to\r\nthe moral and intellectual health of our race. The Brahminical mythology\r\nis so absurd that it necessarily debases every mind which receives it\r\nas truth; and with this absurd mythology is bound up an absurd system of\r\nphysics, an absurd geography, an absurd astronomy. Nor is this form\r\nof Paganism more favourable to art than to science. Through the whole\r\nHindoo Pantheon you will look in vain for anything resembling those\r\nbeautiful and majestic forms which stood in the shrines of ancient\r\nGreece. All is hideous, and grotesque, and ignoble. As this superstition\r\nis of all superstitions the most irrational, and of all superstitions\r\nthe most inelegant, so is it of all superstitions the most immoral.\r\nEmblems of vice are objects of public worship. Acts of vice are acts of\r\npublic worship. The courtesans are as much a part of the establishment\r\nof the temple, as much ministers of the god, as the priests. Crimes\r\nagainst life, crimes against property, are not only permitted but\r\nenjoined by this odious theology. But for our interference human victims\r\nwould still be offered to the Ganges, and the widow would still be laid\r\non the pile with the corpse of her husband, and burned alive by her own\r\nchildren. It is by the command and under the especial protection of one\r\nof the most powerful goddesses that the Thugs join themselves to the\r\nunsuspecting traveller, make friends with him, slip the noose round his\r\nneck, plunge their knives in his eyes, hide him in the earth, and divide\r\nhis money and baggage. I have read many examinations of Thugs; and I\r\nparticularly remember an altercation which took place between two\r\nof those wretches in the presence of an English officer. One Thug\r\nreproached the other for having been so irreligious as to spare the life\r\nof a traveller when the omens indicated that their patroness required\r\na victim. \"How could you let him go? How can you expect the goddess\r\nto protect us if you disobey her commands? That is one of your North\r\ncountry heresies.\" Now, Sir, it is a difficult matter to determine\r\nin what way Christian rulers ought to deal with such superstitions as\r\nthese. We might have acted as the Spaniards acted in the New World. We\r\nmight have attempted to introduce our own religion by force. We might\r\nhave sent missionaries among the natives at the public charge. We might\r\nhave held out hopes of public employment to converts, and have imposed\r\ncivil disabilities on Mahometans and Pagans. But we did none of these\r\nthings; and herein we judged wisely. Our duty, as rulers, was to\r\npreserve strict neutrality on all questions merely religious: and I\r\nam not aware that we have ever swerved from strict neutrality for the\r\npurpose of making proselytes to our own faith. But we have, I am\r\nsorry to say, sometimes deviated from the right path in the opposite\r\ndirection. Some Englishmen, who have held high office in India, seem to\r\nhave thought that the only religion which was not entitled to toleration\r\nand to respect was Christianity. They regarded every Christian\r\nmissionary with extreme jealousy and disdain; and they suffered the\r\nmost atrocious crimes, if enjoined by the Hindoo superstition, to be\r\nperpetrated in open day. It is lamentable to think how long after our\r\npower was firmly established in Bengal, we, grossly neglecting the first\r\nand plainest duty of the civil magistrate, suffered the practices of\r\ninfanticide and Suttee to continue unchecked. We decorated the temples\r\nof the false gods. We provided the dancing girls. We gilded and painted\r\nthe images to which our ignorant subjects bowed down. We repaired and\r\nembellished the car under the wheels of which crazy devotees flung\r\nthemselves at every festival to be crushed to death. We sent guards of\r\nhonour to escort pilgrims to the places of worship. We actually made\r\noblations at the shrines of idols. All this was considered, and is\r\nstill considered, by some prejudiced Anglo-Indians of the old school, as\r\nprofound policy. I believe that there never was so shallow, so senseless\r\na policy. We gained nothing by it. We lowered ourselves in the eyes of\r\nthose whom we meant to flatter. We led them to believe that we attached\r\nno importance to the difference between Christianity and heathenism.\r\nYet how vast that difference is! I altogether abstain from alluding to\r\ntopics which belong to divines. I speak merely as a politician anxious\r\nfor the morality and the temporal well-being of society. And, so\r\nspeaking, I say that to countenance the Brahminical idolatry, and to\r\ndiscountenance that religion which has done so much to promote justice,\r\nand mercy, and freedom, and arts, and sciences, and good government, and\r\ndomestic happiness, which has struck off the chains of the slave, which\r\nhas mitigated the horrors of war, which has raised women from servants\r\nand playthings into companions and friends, is to commit high treason\r\nagainst humanity and civilisation.\r\n\r\nGradually a better system was introduced. A great man whom we have\r\nlately lost, Lord Wellesley, led the way. He prohibited the immolation\r\nof female children; and this was the most unquestionable of all his\r\ntitles to the gratitude of his country. In the year 1813 Parliament\r\ngave new facilities to persons who were desirous to proceed to India\r\nas missionaries. Lord William Bentinck abolished the Suttee. Shortly\r\nafterwards the Home Government sent out to Calcutta the important and\r\nvaluable despatch to which reference has been repeatedly made in the\r\ncourse of this discussion. That despatch Lord Glenelg wrote,--I was then\r\nat the Board of Control, and can attest the fact,--with his own hand.\r\nOne paragraph, the sixty-second, is of the highest moment. I know that\r\nparagraph so well that I could repeat it word for word. It contains in\r\nshort compass an entire code of regulations for the guidance of British\r\nfunctionaries in matters relating to the idolatry of India. The orders\r\nof the Home Government were express, that the arrangements of the\r\ntemples should be left entirely to the natives. A certain discretion\r\nwas of course left to the local authorities as to the time and manner\r\nof dissolving that connection which had long existed between the English\r\nGovernment and the Brahminical superstition. But the principle was laid\r\ndown in the clearest manner. This was in February 1833. In the year 1838\r\nanother despatch was sent, which referred to the sixty-second paragraph\r\nin Lord Glenelg's despatch, and enjoined the Indian Government to\r\nobserve the rules contained in that paragraph. Again, in the year 1841,\r\nprecise orders were sent out on the same subject, orders which Lord\r\nEllenborough seems to me to have studied carefully for the express\r\npurpose of disobeying them point by point, and in the most direct\r\nmanner. You murmur: but only look at the orders of the Directors and at\r\nthe proclamation of the Governor General. The orders are, distinctly and\r\npositively, that the British authorities in India shall have nothing\r\nto do with the temples of the natives, shall make no presents to those\r\ntemples, shall not decorate those temples, shall not pay any military\r\nhonour to those temples. Now, Sir, the first charge which I bring\r\nagainst Lord Ellenborough is, that he has been guilty of an act of gross\r\ndisobedience, that he has done that which was forbidden in the strongest\r\nterms by those from whom his power is derived. The Home Government says,\r\nDo not interfere in the concerns of heathen temples. Is it denied that\r\nLord Ellenborough has interfered in the concerns of a heathen temple?\r\nThe Home Government says, Make no presents to heathen temples. Is\r\nit denied that Lord Ellenborough has proclaimed to all the world his\r\nintention to make a present to a heathen temple? The Home Government\r\nsays, Do not decorate heathen temples. Is it denied that Lord\r\nEllenborough has proclaimed to all the world his intention to decorate\r\na heathen temple? The Home Government says, Do not send troops to do\r\nhonour to heathen temples. Is it denied that Lord Ellenborough sent a\r\nbody of troops to escort these gates to a heathen temple? To be sure,\r\nthe honourable gentleman the Secretary of the Board of Control tries to\r\nget rid of this part of the case in rather a whimsical manner. He says\r\nthat it is impossible to believe that, by sending troops to escort the\r\ngates, Lord Ellenborough can have meant to pay any mark of respect to\r\nan idol. And why? Because, says the honourable gentleman, the Court of\r\nDirectors had given positive orders that troops should not be employed\r\nto pay marks of respect to idols. Why, Sir, undoubtedly, if it is to be\r\ntaken for granted that Lord Ellenborough is a perfect man, if all our\r\nreasonings are to proceed on the supposition that he cannot do wrong,\r\nthen I admit the force of the honourable gentleman's argument. But it\r\nseems to me a strange and dangerous thing to infer a man's innocence\r\nmerely from the flagrancy of his guilt. It is certain that the Home\r\nauthorities ordered the Governor General not to employ the troops in the\r\nservice of a temple. It is certain that Lord Ellenborough employed the\r\ntroops to escort a trophy, an oblation, which he sent to the restored\r\ntemple of Somnauth. Yes, the restored temple of Somnauth. Those are his\r\nlordship's words. They have given rise to some discussion, and seem not\r\nto be understood by everybody in the same sense. We all know that this\r\ntemple is an ruins. I am confident that Lord Ellenborough knew it to be\r\nin ruins, and that his intention was to rebuild it at the public charge.\r\nThat is the obvious meaning of his words. But, as this meaning is so\r\nmonstrous that nobody here can venture to defend it, his friends pretend\r\nthat he believed the temple to have been already restored, and that he\r\nhad no thought of being himself the restorer. How can I believe this?\r\nHow can I believe that, when he issued this proclamation, he knew\r\nnothing about the state of the temple to which he proposed to make an\r\noffering of such importance? He evidently knew that it had once been in\r\nruins; or he would not have called it the restored temple. Why am I to\r\nsuppose that he imagined it to have been rebuilt? He had people about\r\nhim who knew it well, and who could have told him that it was in ruins\r\nstill. To say that he was not aware that it was in ruins is to say that\r\nhe put forth his proclamation without taking the trouble to ask a single\r\nquestion of those who were close at hand and were perfectly competent to\r\ngive him information. Why, Sir, this defence is itself an accusation. I\r\ndefy the honourable gentleman the Secretary of the Board of Control, I\r\ndefy all human ingenuity, to get his lordship clear off from both the\r\nhorns of this dilemma. Either way, he richly deserves a parliamentary\r\ncensure. Either he published this proclamation in the recklessness of\r\nutter ignorance without making the smallest inquiry; or else he, an\r\nEnglish and a Christian Governor, meant to build a temple to a heathen\r\ngod at the public charge, in direct defiance of the commands of his\r\nofficial superiors. Turn and twist the matter which way you will, you\r\ncan make nothing else of it. The stain is like the stain of Blue Beard's\r\nkey, in the nursery tale. As soon as you have scoured one side clean,\r\nthe spot comes out on the other.\r\n\r\nSo much for the first charge, the charge of disobedience. It is fully\r\nmade out: but it is not the heaviest charge which I bring against Lord\r\nEllenborough. I charge him with having done that which, even if it had\r\nnot been, as it was, strictly forbidden by the Home authorities, it\r\nwould still have been a high crime to do. He ought to have known,\r\nwithout any instructions from home, that it was his duty not to take\r\npart in disputes among the false religions of the East; that it was his\r\nduty, in his official character, to show no marked preference for any of\r\nthose religions, and to offer no marked insult to any. But, Sir, he has\r\npaid unseemly homage to one of those religions; he has grossly insulted\r\nanother; and he has selected as the object of his homage the very worst\r\nand most degrading of those religions, and as the object of his insults\r\nthe best and purest of them. The homage was paid to Lingamism. The\r\ninsult was offered to Mahometanism. Lingamism is not merely idolatry,\r\nbut idolatry in its most pernicious form. The honourable gentleman the\r\nSecretary of the Board of Control seemed to think that he had achieved\r\na great victory when he had made out that his lordship's devotions had\r\nbeen paid, not to Vishnu, but to Siva. Sir, Vishnu is the preserving\r\nDeity of the Hindoo Mythology; Siva is the destroying Deity; and, as far\r\nas I have any preference for one of your Governor General's gods over\r\nanother, I confess that my own tastes would lead me to prefer the\r\npreserving to the destroying power. Yes, Sir; the temple of Somnauth\r\nwas sacred to Siva; and the honourable gentleman cannot but know by what\r\nemblem Siva is represented, and with what rites he is adored. I will say\r\nno more. The Governor General, Sir, is in some degree protected by the\r\nvery magnitude of his offence. I am ashamed to name those things\r\nto which he is not ashamed to pay public reverence. This god of\r\ndestruction, whose images and whose worship it would be a violation of\r\ndecency to describe, is selected as the object of homage. As the object\r\nof insult is selected a religion which has borrowed much of its theology\r\nand much of its morality from Christianity, a religion which in the\r\nmidst of Polytheism teaches the unity of God, and, in the midst of\r\nidolatry, strictly proscribes the worship of images. The duty of our\r\nGovernment is, as I said, to take no part in the disputes between\r\nMahometans and idolaters. But, if our Government does take a part, there\r\ncannot be a doubt that Mahometanism is entitled to the preference. Lord\r\nEllenborough is of a different opinion. He takes away the gates from a\r\nMahometan mosque, and solemnly offers them as a gift to a Pagan temple.\r\nMorally, this is a crime. Politically, it is a blunder. Nobody who knows\r\nanything of the Mahometans of India can doubt that this affront to their\r\nfaith will excite their fiercest indignation. Their susceptibility on\r\nsuch points is extreme. Some of the most serious disasters that have\r\never befallen us in India have been caused by that susceptibility.\r\nRemember what happened at Vellore in 1806, and more recently at\r\nBangalore. The mutiny of Vellore was caused by a slight shown to the\r\nMahometan turban; the mutiny of Bangalore, by disrespect said to have\r\nbeen shown to a Mahometan place of worship. If a Governor General had\r\nbeen induced by his zeal for Christianity to offer any affront to a\r\nmosque held in high veneration by Mussulmans, I should think that he had\r\nbeen guilty of indiscretion such as proved him to be unfit for his\r\npost. But to affront a mosque of peculiar dignity, not from zeal for\r\nChristianity, but for the sake of this loathsome god of destruction, is\r\nnothing short of madness. Some temporary popularity Lord Ellenborough\r\nmay no doubt gain in some quarters. I hear, and I can well believe, that\r\nsome bigoted Hindoos have hailed this proclamation with delight, and\r\nhave begun to entertain a hope that the British Government is about to\r\ntake their worship under its peculiar protection. But how long will that\r\nhope last? I presume that the right honourable Baronet the First Lord of\r\nthe Treasury does not mean to suffer India to be governed on Brahminical\r\nprinciples. I presume that he will not allow the public revenue to be\r\nexpended in rebuilding temples, adorning idols, and hiring courtesans.\r\nI have no doubt that there is already on the way to India such an\r\nadmonition as will prevent Lord Ellenborough from persisting in the\r\ncourse on which he has entered. The consequence will be that the\r\nexultation of the Brahmins will end in mortification and anger. See\r\nthen of what a complication of faults the Governor General is guilty.\r\nIn order to curry favour with the Hindoos he has offered an inexpiable\r\ninsult to the Mahometans; and now, in order to quiet the English, he\r\nis forced to disappoint and disgust the Hindoos. But, apart from the\r\nirritating effect which these transactions must produce on every part of\r\nthe native population, is it no evil to have this continual wavering and\r\nchanging? This is not the only case in which Lord Ellenborough has, with\r\ngreat pomp, announced intentions which he has not been able to carry\r\ninto effect. It is his Lordship's habit. He put forth a notification\r\nthat his Durbar was to be honoured by the presence of Dost Mahomed.\r\nThen came a notification that Dost Mahomed would not make his appearance\r\nthere. In the proclamation which we are now considering his lordship\r\nannounced to all the princes of India his resolution to set up these\r\ngates at Somnauth. The gates, it is now universally admitted, will\r\nnot be set up there. All India will see that the Governor General has\r\nchanged his mind. The change may be imputed to mere fickleness and\r\nlevity. It may be imputed to the disapprobation with which his conduct\r\nhas been regarded here. In either case he appears in a light in which it\r\nis much to be deplored that a Governor General should appear.\r\n\r\nSo much for the serious side of this business; and now for the ludicrous\r\nside. Even in our mirth, however, there is sadness; for it is no light\r\nthing that he who represents the British nation in India should be a\r\njest to the people of India. We have sometimes sent them governors whom\r\nthey loved, and sometimes governors whom they feared; but they never\r\nbefore had a governor at whom they laughed. Now, however, they laugh;\r\nand how can we blame them for laughing, when all Europe and all America\r\nare laughing too? You see, Sir, that the gentlemen opposite cannot keep\r\ntheir countenances. And no wonder. Was such a State paper ever seen in\r\nour language before? And what is the plea set up for all this bombast?\r\nWhy, the honourable gentleman the Secretary of the Board of Control\r\nbrings down to the House some translations of Persian letters from\r\nnative princes. Such letters, as everybody knows, are written in a most\r\nabsurd and turgid style. The honourable gentleman forces us to hear\r\na good deal of this detestable rhetoric; and then he asks why, if the\r\nsecretaries of the Nizam and the King of Oude use all these tropes and\r\nhyperboles, Lord Ellenborough should not indulge in the same sort\r\nof eloquence? The honourable gentleman might as well ask why Lord\r\nEllenborough should not sit cross-legged, why he should not let his\r\nbeard grow to his waist, why he should not wear a turban, why he should\r\nnot hang trinkets all about his person, why he should not ride about\r\nCalcutta on a horse jingling with bells and glittering with false\r\npearls. The native princes do these things; and why should not he? Why,\r\nSir, simply because he is not a native prince, but an English Governor\r\nGeneral. When the people of India see a Nabob or a Rajah in all his\r\ngaudy finery, they bow to him with a certain respect. They know that\r\nthe splendour of his garb indicates superior rank and wealth. But if Sir\r\nCharles Metcalfe had so bedizened himself, they would have thought\r\nthat he was out of his wits. They are not such fools as the honourable\r\ngentleman takes them for. Simplicity is not their fashion. But they\r\nunderstand and respect the simplicity of our fashions. Our plain\r\nclothing commands far more reverence than all the jewels which the most\r\ntawdry Zemindar wears; and our plain language carries with it far more\r\nweight than the florid diction of the most ingenious Persian scribe. The\r\nplain language and the plain clothing are inseparably associated in the\r\nminds of our subjects with superior knowledge, with superior energy,\r\nwith superior veracity, with all the high and commanding qualities which\r\nerected, and which still uphold, our empire. Sir, if, as the speech of\r\nthe honourable gentleman the Secretary of the Board of Control seems to\r\nindicate, Lord Ellenborough has adopted this style on principle, if it\r\nbe his lordship's deliberate intention to mimic, in his State papers,\r\nthe Asiatic modes of thought and expression, that alone would be a\r\nreason for recalling him. But the honourable gentlemen is mistaken in\r\nthinking that this proclamation is in the Oriental taste. It bears no\r\nresemblance to the very bad Oriental compositions which he has read\r\nto us, nor to any other Oriental compositions that I ever saw. It is\r\nneither English nor Indian. It is not original, however; and I will tell\r\nthe House where the Governor General found his models. He has apparently\r\nbeen studying the rants of the French Jacobins during the period of\r\ntheir ascendency, the Carmagnoles of the Convention, the proclamations\r\nissued by the Directory and its Proconsuls: and he has been seized with\r\na desire to imitate those compositions. The pattern which he seems to\r\nhave especially proposed to himself is the rhodomontade in which it was\r\nannounced that the modern Gauls were marching to Rome in order to avenge\r\nthe fate of Dumnorix and Vercingetorex. Everybody remembers those lines\r\nin which revolutionary justice is described by Mr Canning:--\r\n\r\n     \"Not she in British courts who takes her stand,\r\n     The dawdling balance dangling in her hand;\r\n     But firm, erect, with keen reverted glance,\r\n     The avenging angel of regenerate France,\r\n     Who visits ancient sins on modern times,\r\n     And punishes the Pope for Caesar's crimes.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same spirit and in the same style our Governor General has\r\nproclaimed his intention to retaliate on the Mussulmans beyond the\r\nmountains the insults which their ancestors, eight hundred years ago,\r\noffered to the idolatry of the Hindoos. To do justice to the Jacobins,\r\nhowever, I must say that they had an excuse which was wanting to the\r\nnoble lord. The revolution had made almost as great a change in literary\r\ntastes as in political institutions. The old masters of French eloquence\r\nhad shared the fate of the old states and of the old parliaments. The\r\nhighest posts in the administration were filled by persons who had\r\nno experience of affairs, who in the general confusion had raised\r\nthemselves by audacity and quickness of natural parts, uneducated men,\r\nor half educated men, who had no notion that the style in which they had\r\nheard the heroes and villains of tragedies declaim on the stage was\r\nnot the style of real warriors and statesmen. But was it for an English\r\ngentleman, a man of distinguished abilities and cultivated mind, a man\r\nwho had sate many years in parliament, and filled some of the highest\r\nposts in the State, to copy the productions of such a school?\r\n\r\nBut, it is said, what does it matter if the noble lord has written\r\na foolish rhapsody which is neither prose nor verse? Is affected\r\nphraseology a subject for parliamentary censure? What great ruler can be\r\nnamed who has not committed errors much more serious than the penning of\r\na few sentences of turgid nonsense? This, I admit, sounds plausible.\r\nIt is quite true that very eminent men, Lord Somers, for example, Sir\r\nRobert Walpole, Lord Chatham and his son, all committed faults which did\r\nmuch more harm than any fault of style can do. But I beg the House to\r\nobserve this, that an error which produces the most serious consequences\r\nmay not necessarily prove that the man who has committed it is not a\r\nvery wise man; and that, on the other hand, an error which directly\r\nproduces no important consequences may prove the man who has committed\r\nit to be quite unfit for public trust. Walpole committed a ruinous\r\nerror when he yielded to the public cry for war with Spain. But,\r\nnotwithstanding that error, he was an eminently wise man. Caligula, on\r\nthe other hand, when he marched his soldiers to the beach, made them\r\nfill their helmets with cockle-shells, and sent the shells to be placed\r\nin the Capitol as trophies of his conquests, did no great harm to\r\nanybody; but he surely proved that he was quite incapable of governing\r\nan empire. Mr Pitt's expedition to Quiberon was most ill judged, and\r\nended in defeat and disgrace. Yet Mr Pitt was a statesman of a very high\r\norder. On the other hand, such ukases as those by which the Emperor\r\nPaul used to regulate the dress of the people of Petersburg, though they\r\ncaused much less misery than the slaughter at Quiberon, proved that\r\nthe Emperor Paul could not safely be trusted with power over his\r\nfellow-creatures. One day he forbade the wearing of pantaloons. Another\r\nday he forbade his subjects to comb their hair over their foreheads.\r\nThen he proscribed round hats. A young Englishman, the son of a\r\nmerchant, thought to evade this decree by going about the city in a\r\nhunting cap. Then came out an edict which made it penal to wear on the\r\nhead a round thing such as the English merchant's son wore. Now, Sir,\r\nI say that, when I examine the substance of Lord Ellenborough's\r\nproclamation, and consider all the consequences which that paper is\r\nlikely to produce, I am forced to say that he has committed a grave\r\nmoral and political offence. When I examine the style, I see that he\r\nhas committed an act of eccentric folly, much of the same kind with\r\nCaligula's campaign against the cockles, and with the Emperor Paul's\r\nukase against round hats. Consider what an extravagant selfconfidence,\r\nwhat a disdain for the examples of his great predecessors and for the\r\nopinions of the ablest and most experienced men who are now to be found\r\nin the Indian services, this strange document indicates. Surely it might\r\nhave occurred to Lord Ellenborough that, if this kind of eloquence had\r\nbeen likely to produce a favourable impression on the minds of Asiatics,\r\nsuch Governors as Warren Hastings, Mr Elphinstone, Sir Thomas Munro,\r\nand Sir Charles Metcalfe, men who were as familiar with the language and\r\nmanners of the native population of India as any man here can be\r\nwith the language and manners of the French, would not have left the\r\ndiscovery to be made by a new comer who did not know any Eastern tongue.\r\nSurely, too, it might have occurred to the noble lord that, before he\r\nput forth such a proclamation, he would do well to ask some person who\r\nknew India intimately what the effect both on the Mahometans and Hindoos\r\nwas likely to be. I firmly believe that the Governor General either did\r\nnot ask advice or acted in direct opposition to advice. Mr Maddock was\r\nwith his lordship as acting Secretary. Now I know enough of Mr Maddock\r\nto be quite certain that he never counselled the Governor General to\r\npublish such a paper. I will pawn my life that he either was never\r\ncalled upon to give an opinion, or that he gave an opinion adverse to\r\nthe course which has been taken. No Governor General who was on good\r\nterms with the civil service would have been, I may say, permitted to\r\nexpose himself thus. Lord William Bentinck and Lord Auckland were, to be\r\nsure, the last men in the world to think of doing such a thing as this.\r\nBut if either of those noble lords, at some unlucky moment when he was\r\nnot quite himself, when his mind was thrown off the balance by the pride\r\nand delight of an extraordinary success, had proposed to put forth such\r\na proclamation, he would have been saved from committing so great a\r\nmistake by the respectful but earnest remonstrances of those in whom\r\nhe placed confidence, and who were solicitous for his honour. From the\r\nappearance of this proclamation, therefore, I infer that the terms on\r\nwhich Lord Ellenborough is with the civil servants of the Company are\r\nsuch that those servants could not venture to offer him counsel when he\r\nmost needed it.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Sir, I think the noble lord unfit for high public\r\ntrust. Let us, then, consider the nature of the public trust which\r\nis now reposed in him. Are gentlemen aware that, even when he is at\r\nCalcutta, surrounded by his councillors, his single voice can carry any\r\nresolution concerning the executive administration against them all?\r\nThey can object: they can protest: they can record their opinions\r\nin writing, and can require him to give in writing his reasons for\r\npersisting in his own course: but they must then submit. On the most\r\nimportant questions, on the question whether a war shall be declared,\r\non the question whether a treaty shall be concluded, on the question\r\nwhether the whole system of land revenue established in a great province\r\nshall be changed, his single vote weighs down the votes of all who\r\nsit at the Board with him. The right honourable Baronet opposite is a\r\npowerful minister, a more powerful minister than any that we have seen\r\nduring many years. But I will venture to say that his power over the\r\npeople of England is nothing when compared with the power which the\r\nGovernor General possesses over the people of India. Such is Lord\r\nEllenborough's power when he is with his council, and is to some extent\r\nheld in check. But where is he now? He has given his council the slip.\r\nHe is alone. He has near him no person who is entitled and bound to\r\noffer advice, asked or unasked: he asks no advice: and you cannot expect\r\nmen to outstep the strict line of their official duty by obtruding\r\nadvice on a superior by whom it would be ungraciously received. The\r\ndanger of having a rash and flighty Governor General is sufficiently\r\nserious at the very best. But the danger of having such a Governor\r\nGeneral up the country, eight or nine hundred miles from any person who\r\nhas a right to remonstrate with him, is fearful indeed. Interests so\r\nvast, that the most sober language in which they can be described sounds\r\nhyperbolical, are entrusted to a single man; to a man who, whatever\r\nhis parts may be, and they are doubtless considerable, has shown an\r\nindiscretion and temerity almost beyond belief; to a man who has been\r\nonly a few months in India; to a man who takes no counsel with those who\r\nare well acquainted with India.\r\n\r\nI cannot sit down without addressing myself to those Directors of the\r\nEast India Company who are present. I exhort them to consider the heavy\r\nresponsibility which rests on them. They have the power to recall Lord\r\nEllenborough; and I trust that they will not hesitate to exercise that\r\npower. This is the advice of one who has been their servant, who has\r\nserved them loyally, and who is still sincerely anxious for their credit\r\nand for the welfare of the empire of which they are the guardians. But\r\nif, from whatever cause, they are unwilling to recall the noble lord,\r\nthen I implore them to take care that he be immediately ordered to\r\nreturn to Calcutta. Who can say what new freak we may hear of by the\r\nnext mail? I am quite confident that neither the Court of Directors nor\r\nHer Majesty's Ministers can look forward to the arrival of that mail\r\nwithout great uneasiness. Therefore I say, send Lord Ellenborough back\r\nto Calcutta. There at least he will find persons who have a right to\r\nadvise him and to expostulate with him, and who will, I doubt not, have\r\nalso the spirit to do so. It is something that he will be forced to\r\nrecord his reasons for what he does. It is something that he will be\r\nforced to hear reasons against his propositions. It is something that a\r\ndelay, though only of twenty-four hours, will be interposed between the\r\nfirst conception of a wild scheme and the execution. I am afraid that\r\nthese checks will not be sufficient to prevent much evil: but they are\r\nnot absolutely nugatory. I entreat the Directors to consider in what\r\na position they will stand if, in consequence of their neglect, some\r\nserious calamity should befall the country which is confided to their\r\ncare. I will only say, in conclusion, that, if there be any use in\r\nhaving a Council of India, if it be not meant that the members of\r\nCouncil should draw large salaries for doing nothing, if they are really\r\nappointed for the purpose of assisting and restraining the Governor,\r\nit is to the last degree absurd that their powers should be in abeyance\r\nwhen there is a Governor who, of all the Governors that ever England\r\nsent to the East, stands most in need both of assistance and of\r\nrestraint.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF IRELAND. (FEBRUARY 19, 1844) A SPEECH DELIVERED IN THE\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS ON THE 19TH OF FEBRUARY 1844.\r\n\r\nOn the thirteenth of February 1844, Lord John Russell moved for a\r\nCommittee of the whole House to take into consideration the state of\r\nIreland. After a discussion of nine nights the motion was rejected by\r\n324 votes to 225. On the fifth night of the debate the following Speech\r\nwas made.\r\n\r\nI cannot refrain, Sir, from congratulating you and the House that I\r\ndid not catch your eye when I rose before. I should have been extremely\r\nsorry to have prevented any Irish member from addressing the House on a\r\nquestion so interesting to Ireland, but peculiarly sorry to have stood\r\nin the way of the honourable gentleman who to-night pleaded the cause of\r\nhis country with so much force and eloquence. (Mr J. O'Brien.)\r\n\r\nI am sorry to say that I cannot reconcile it to my conscience to follow\r\nthe advice which has been just given me by my honourable friend the\r\nMember for Pomfret (Mr R. Milnes.), with all the authority which, as he\r\nhas reminded us, belongs to his venerable youth. I cannot at all agree\r\nwith him in thinking that the wisest thing that we can do is to suffer\r\nHer Majesty's Ministers to go on in their own way, seeing that the\r\nway in which they have long been going on is an exceedingly bad one. I\r\nsupport the motion of my noble friend for these plain reasons.\r\n\r\nFirst, I hold that Ireland is in a most unsatisfactory, indeed in a most\r\ndangerous, state.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I hold that for the state in which Ireland is Her Majesty's\r\nMinisters are in a great measure accountable, and that they have not\r\nshown, either as legislators, or as administrators, that they are\r\ncapable of remedying the evils which they have caused.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, if I make out these two propositions, it will follow that\r\nit is the constitutional right and duty of the representatives of the\r\nnation to interfere; and I conceive that my noble friend, by moving\r\nfor a Committee of the whole House, has proposed a mode of interference\r\nwhich is both parliamentary and convenient.\r\n\r\nMy first proposition, Sir, will scarcely be disputed. Both sides of the\r\nHouse are fully agreed in thinking that the condition of Ireland may\r\nwell excite great anxiety and apprehension. That island, in extent about\r\none fourth of the United Kingdom, in population more than one-fourth,\r\nsuperior probably in natural fertility to any area of equal size in\r\nEurope, possessed of natural facilities for trade such as can nowhere\r\nelse be found in an equal extent of coast, an inexhaustible nursery of\r\ngallant soldiers, a country far more important to the prosperity,\r\nthe strength, the dignity of this great empire than all our distant\r\ndependencies together, than the Canadas and the West Indies added to\r\nSouthern Africa, to Australasia, to Ceylon, and to the vast dominions\r\nof the Moguls, that island, Sir, is acknowledged by all to be so ill\r\naffected and so turbulent that it must, in any estimate of our power,\r\nbe not added but deducted. You admit that you govern that island, not as\r\nyou govern England and Scotland, but as you govern your new conquests in\r\nScinde; not by means of the respect which the people feel for the laws,\r\nbut by means of bayonets, of artillery, of entrenched camps.\r\n\r\nMy first proposition, then, I take to be conceded. Ireland is in a\r\ndangerous state. The question which remains to be considered is, whether\r\nfor the state in which Ireland is Her Majesty's Ministers are to be held\r\naccountable.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, I at once admit that the distempers of Ireland must in part be\r\nattributed to causes for which neither Her Majesty's present Ministers\r\nnor any public men now living can justly be held accountable. I will not\r\ntrouble the House with a long dissertation on those causes. But it is\r\nnecessary, I think, to take at least a rapid glance at them: and in\r\norder to do so, Sir, we must go back to a period not only anterior to\r\nthe birth of the statesmen who are now arrayed against each other on\r\nthe right and left of your chair, but anterior to the birth even of the\r\ngreat parties of which those statesmen are the leaders; anterior to the\r\ndays when the names of Tory and Whig, of court party and country party,\r\nof cavalier and roundhead, came into use; anterior to the existence\r\nof those Puritans to whom the honourable Member for Shrewsbury (Mr\r\nDisraeli.), in a very ingenious speech, ascribed all the calamities of\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nThe primary cause is, no doubt, the manner in which Ireland became\r\nsubject to the English crown. The annexation was effected by conquest,\r\nand by conquest of a peculiar kind. It was not a conquest such as we\r\nhave been accustomed to see in modern Europe. It was not a conquest\r\nlike that which united Artois and Franche Comte to France, or Silesia\r\nto Prussia. It was the conquest of a race by a race, such a conquest as\r\nthat which established the dominion of the Spaniard over the American\r\nIndian, or of the Mahratta over the peasant of Guzerat or Tanjore. Of\r\nall forms of tyranny, I believe that the worst is that of a nation over\r\na nation. Populations separated by seas and mountain ridges may call\r\neach other natural enemies, may wage long wars with each other, may\r\nrecount with pride the victories which they have gained over each other,\r\nand point to the flags, the guns, the ships which they have won from\r\neach other. But no enmity that ever existed between such populations\r\napproaches in bitterness the mutual enmity felt by populations which\r\nare locally intermingled, but which have never morally and politically\r\namalgamated; and such were the Englishry and the Irishry. Yet it might\r\nhave been hoped that the lapse of time and the progress of civilisation\r\nwould have effaced the distinction between the oppressors and the\r\noppressed. Our island had suffered cruelly from the same evil. Here the\r\nSaxon had trampled on the Celt, the Dane on the Saxon, the Norman on\r\nCelt, Saxon, and Dane. Yet in the course of ages all the four races had\r\nbeen fused together to form the great English people. A similar fusion\r\nwould probably have taken place in Ireland, but for the Reformation. The\r\nEnglish settlers adopted the Protestant doctrines which were received\r\nin England. The Aborigines alone, among all the nations of the north\r\nof Europe, adhered to the ancient faith. Thus the line of demarcation\r\nbetween the two populations was deepened and widened. The old enmity\r\nwas reinforced by a new enmity stronger still. Then came those events\r\nto which the honourable Member for Shrewsbury referred. The spirit of\r\nliberty in England was closely allied with the spirit of Puritanism, and\r\nwas mortally hostile to the Papacy. Such men as Hampden, Vane, Milton,\r\nLocke, though zealous generally for civil and spiritual freedom, yet\r\nheld that the Roman Catholic worship had no claim to toleration. On the\r\nother hand, all the four kings of the House of Stuart showed far\r\nmore favour to Roman Catholics than to any class of Protestant\r\nnonconformists. James the First at one time had some hopes of effecting\r\na reconciliation with the Vatican. Charles the First entered into secret\r\nengagements to grant an indulgence to Roman Catholics. Charles the\r\nSecond was a concealed Roman Catholic. James the Second was an avowed\r\nRoman Catholic. Consequently, through the whole of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, the freedom of Ireland and the slavery of England meant the\r\nsame thing. The watchwords, the badges, the names, the places, the days,\r\nwhich in the mind of an Englishman were associated with deliverance,\r\nprosperity, national dignity, were in the mind of an Irishman associated\r\nwith bondage, ruin, and degradation. The memory of William the Third,\r\nthe anniversary of the battle of the Boyne, are instances. I was much\r\nstruck by a circumstance which occurred on a day which I have every\r\nreason to remember with gratitude and pride, the day on which I had the\r\nhigh honour of being declared one of the first two members for the great\r\nborough of Leeds. My chair was covered with orange ribands. The horses\r\nwhich drew it could hardly be seen for the profusion of orange-coloured\r\nfinery with which they were adorned. Orange cockades were in all the\r\nhats; orange favours at all the windows. And my supporters, I need\r\nnot say, were men who had, like myself, been zealous for Catholic\r\nemancipation. I could not help remarking that the badge seemed rather\r\nincongruous. But I was told that the friends of Catholic emancipation\r\nin Yorkshire had always rallied under the orange banner, that orange was\r\nthe colour of Sir George Savile, who brought in that bill which caused\r\nthe No Popery riots of 1780, and that the very chair in which I sate\r\nwas the chair in which Lord Milton, now Earl Fitzwilliam, had triumphed\r\nafter the great victory which he won in 1807 over the No Popery party,\r\nthen headed by the house of Harewood. I thought how different an effect\r\nthat procession would have produced at Limerick or Cork, with what howls\r\nof rage and hatred the Roman Catholic population of those cities\r\nwould have pursued that orange flag which, to every Roman Catholic in\r\nYorkshire, was the memorial of contests maintained in favour of his own\r\ndearest rights. This circumstance, however slight, well illustrates\r\nthe singular contrast between the history of England and the history of\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nWell, Sir, twice during the seventeenth century the Irish rose up\r\nagainst the English colony. Twice they were completely put down; and\r\ntwice they were severely chastised. The first rebellion was crushed by\r\nOliver Cromwell; the second by William the Third. Those great men did\r\nnot use their victory exactly in the same way. The policy of Cromwell\r\nwas wise, and strong, and straightforward, and cruel. It was comprised\r\nin one word, which, as Clarendon tells us, was often in the mouths of\r\nthe Englishry of that time. That word was extirpation. The object of\r\nCromwell was to make Ireland thoroughly Anglo-Saxon and Protestant. If\r\nhe had lived twenty years longer he might perhaps have accomplished that\r\nwork: but he died while it was incomplete; and it died with him.\r\nThe policy of William, or to speak more correctly, of those whose\r\ninclinations William was under the necessity of consulting, was less\r\nable, less energetic, and, though more humane in seeming, perhaps not\r\nmore humane in reality. Extirpation was not attempted. The Irish Roman\r\nCatholics were permitted to live, to be fruitful, to replenish the\r\nearth: but they were doomed to be what the Helots were in Sparta, what\r\nthe Greeks were under the Ottoman, what the blacks now are at New York.\r\nEvery man of the subject caste was strictly excluded from public trust.\r\nTake what path he might in life, he was crossed at every step by some\r\nvexatious restriction. It was only by being obscure and inactive that\r\nhe could, on his native soil, be safe. If he aspired to be powerful\r\nand honoured, he must begin by being an exile. If he pined for military\r\nglory, he might gain a cross or perhaps a Marshal's staff in the\r\narmies of France or Austria. If his vocation was to politics, he might\r\ndistinguish himself in the diplomacy of Italy or Spain. But at home he\r\nwas a mere Gibeonite, a hewer of wood and a drawer of water. The statute\r\nbook of Ireland was filled with enactments which furnish to the Roman\r\nCatholics but too good a ground for recriminating on us when we talk\r\nof the barbarities of Bonner and Gardiner; and the harshness of those\r\nodious laws was aggravated by a more odious administration. For, bad as\r\nthe legislators were, the magistrates were worse still. In those evil\r\ntimes originated that most unhappy hostility between landlord and\r\ntenant, which is one of the peculiar curses of Ireland. Oppression and\r\nturbulence reciprocally generated each other. The combination of rustic\r\ntyrants was resisted by gangs of rustic banditti. Courts of law and\r\njuries existed only for the benefit of the dominant sect. Those priests\r\nwho were revered by millions as their natural advisers and guardians,\r\nas the only authorised expositors of Christian truth, as the only\r\nauthorised dispensers of the Christian sacraments, were treated by the\r\nsquires and squireens of the ruling faction as no good-natured man would\r\ntreat the vilest beggar. In this manner a century passed away. Then came\r\nthe French Revolution and the great awakening of the mind of Europe. It\r\nwould have been wonderful indeed if, when the happiest and most tranquil\r\nnations were agitated by vague discontents and vague hopes, Ireland had\r\nremained at rest. Jacobinism, it is true, was not a very natural ally\r\nof the Roman Catholic religion. But common enmities produce strange\r\ncoalitions; and a strange coalition was formed. There was a third great\r\nrising of the aboriginal population of the island against English and\r\nProtestant ascendency. That rising was put down by the sword; and it\r\nbecame the duty of those who were at the head of affairs to consider how\r\nthe victory should be used.\r\n\r\nI shall not be suspected of being partial to the memory of Mr Pitt. But\r\nI cannot refuse to him the praise both of wisdom and of humanity, when I\r\ncompare the plan which he formed in that hour of triumph with the plans\r\nof those English rulers who had before him governed Ireland. Of Mr\r\nPitt's plan the Union was a part, an excellent and an essential part\r\nindeed, but still only a part. We shall do great injustice both to his\r\nhead and to his heart, if we forget that he was permitted to carry\r\ninto effect only some unconnected portions of a comprehensive and\r\nwell-concerted scheme. He wished to blend, not only the parliaments, but\r\nthe nations, and to make the two islands one in interest and affection.\r\nWith that view the Roman Catholic disabilities were to be removed: the\r\nRoman Catholic priests were to be placed in a comfortable and honourable\r\nposition; and measures were to be taken for the purpose of giving to\r\nRoman Catholics the benefits of liberal education. In truth, Mr Pitt's\r\nopinions on those subjects had, to a great extent, been derived from a\r\nmind even more powerful and capacious than his own, from the mind of Mr\r\nBurke. If the authority of these two great men had prevailed, I believe\r\nthat the Union with Ireland would now have been as secure, and as\r\nmuch beyond the reach of agitation, as the Union with Scotland. The\r\nParliament in College Green would have been remembered as what it was,\r\nthe most tyrannical, the most venal, the most unprincipled assembly\r\nthat ever sate on the face of this earth. I do not think that, by saying\r\nthis, I can give offence to any gentleman from Ireland, however zealous\r\nfor Repeal he may be: for I only repeat the language of Wolfe Tone.\r\nWolfe Tone said that he had seen more deliberative assemblies than most\r\nmen; that he had seen the English Parliament, the American Congress,\r\nthe French Council of Elders and Council of Five Hundred, the Batavian\r\nConvention; but that he had nowhere found anything like the baseness and\r\nimpudence of the scoundrels, as he called them, at Dublin. If Mr Pitt's\r\nwhole plan had been carried into execution, that infamous parliament,\r\nthat scandal to the name of parliament, would have perished unregretted;\r\nand the last day of its existence would have been remembered by the\r\nRoman Catholics of Ireland as the first day of their civil and religious\r\nliberty. The great boon which he would have conferred on them would have\r\nbeen gratefully received, because it could not have been ascribed to\r\nfear, because it would have been a boon bestowed by the powerful on the\r\nweak, by the victor on the vanquished. Unhappily, of all his projects\r\nfor the benefit of Ireland the Union alone was carried into effect; and\r\ntherefore that Union was an Union only in name. The Irish found that\r\nthey had parted with at least the name and show of independence, and\r\nthat for this sacrifice of national pride they were to receive no\r\ncompensation. The Union, which ought to have been associated in their\r\nminds with freedom and justice, was associated only with disappointed\r\nhopes and forfeited pledges. Yet it was not even then too late. It was\r\nnot too late in 1813. It was not too late in 1821. It was not too late\r\nin 1825. Yes: if, even in 1825, some men who then were, as they now are,\r\nhigh in the service of the crown, could have made up their minds to\r\ndo what they were forced to do four years later, that great work of\r\nconciliation which Mr Pitt had meditated might have been accomplished.\r\nThe machinery of agitation was not yet fully organized: the Government\r\nwas under no strong pressure; and therefore concession might still\r\nhave been received with thankfulness. That opportunity was suffered to\r\nescape; and it never returned.\r\n\r\nIn 1829, at length, concessions were made, were made largely, were made\r\nwithout the conditions which Mr Pitt would undoubtedly have demanded,\r\nand to which, if demanded by Mr Pitt, the whole body of Roman\r\nCatholics would have eagerly assented. But those concessions were made\r\nreluctantly, made ungraciously, made under duress, made from the mere\r\ndread of civil war. How then was it possible that they should produce\r\ncontentment and repose? What could be the effect of that sudden and\r\nprofuse liberality following that long and obstinate resistance to the\r\nmost reasonable demands, except to teach the Irishman that he could\r\nobtain redress only by turbulence? Could he forget that he had been,\r\nduring eight and twenty years, supplicating Parliament for justice,\r\nurging those unanswerable arguments which prove that the rights of\r\nconscience ought to be held sacred, claiming the performance of promises\r\nmade by ministers and princes, and that he had supplicated, argued,\r\nclaimed the performance of promises in vain? Could he forget that two\r\ngenerations of the most profound thinkers, the most brilliant wits, the\r\nmost eloquent orators, had written and spoken for him in vain? Could he\r\nforget that the greatest statesman who took his part had paid dear for\r\ntheir generosity? Mr Pitt endeavoured to redeem his pledge; and he was\r\ndriven from office. Lord Grey and Lord Grenville endeavoured to do but\r\na very small part of what Mr Pitt had thought right and expedient; and\r\nthey were driven from office. Mr Canning took the same side; and his\r\nreward was to be worried to death by the party of which he was the\r\nbrightest ornament. At length, when he was gone, the Roman Catholics\r\nbegan to look, not to cabinets and parliaments, but to themselves. They\r\ndisplayed a formidable array of physical force, and yet kept within,\r\njust within, the limits of the law. The consequence was that, in two\r\nyears, more than any prudent friend had ventured to demand for them was\r\ngranted to them by their enemies. Yes; within two years after Mr Canning\r\nhad been laid in the transept near us, all that he would have done, and\r\nmore than he could have done, was done by his persecutors. How was it\r\npossible that the whole Roman Catholic population of Ireland should not\r\ntake up the notion that from England, or at least from the party which\r\nthen governed and which now governs England, nothing is to be got\r\nby reason, by entreaty, by patient endurance, but everything by\r\nintimidation? That tardy repentance deserved no gratitude, and obtained\r\nnone. The whole machinery of agitation was complete and in perfect\r\norder. The leaders had tasted the pleasures of popularity; the multitude\r\nhad tasted the pleasures of excitement. Both the demagogue and his\r\naudience felt a craving for the daily stimulant. Grievances enough\r\nremained, God knows, to serve as pretexts for agitation: and the whole\r\nconduct of the Government had led the sufferers to believe that by\r\nagitation alone could any grievance be removed.\r\n\r\nSuch, Sir, is the history of the rise and progress of the disorders of\r\nIreland. Misgovernment, lasting without interruption from the reign\r\nof Henry the Second to the reign of William the Fourth, has left us an\r\nimmense mass of discontent, which will, no doubt, in ordinary times,\r\nmake the task of any statesman whom the Queen may call to power\r\nsufficiently difficult. But though this be true, it is not less true,\r\nthat the immediate causes of the extraordinary agitation which alarms us\r\nat this moment is to be found in the misconduct of Her Majesty's present\r\nadvisers. For, Sir, though Ireland is always combustible, Ireland is not\r\nalways on fire. We must distinguish between the chronic complaints which\r\nare to be attributed to remote causes, and the acute attack which\r\nis brought on by recent imprudence. For though there is always a\r\npredisposition to disease in that unhappy society, the violent paroxysms\r\ncome only at intervals. I must own that I am indebted for some of my\r\nimagery to the right honourable Baronet the First Lord of the Treasury.\r\nWhen he sate on this bench, and was only a candidate for the great place\r\nwhich he now fills, he compared himself to a medical man at the bedside\r\nof a patient. Continuing his metaphor, I may say that his prognosis, his\r\ndiagnosis, his treatment, have all been wrong. I do not deny that the\r\ncase was difficult. The sufferer was of a very ill habit of body, and\r\nhad formerly suffered many things of many physicians, and, among others,\r\nI must say, of the right honourable Baronet himself. Still the malady\r\nhad, a very short time ago, been got under, and kept under by the\r\njudicious use of lenitives; and there was reason to hope that if that\r\nsalutary regimen had been steadily followed, there would have been\r\na speedy improvement in the general health. Unhappily, the new State\r\nhygeist chose to apply irritants which have produced a succession of\r\nconvulsive fits, each more violent than that which preceded it. To drop\r\nthe figure, it is impossible to doubt that Lord Melbourne's government\r\nwas popular with the great body of the Roman Catholics of Ireland. It is\r\nimpossible to doubt that the two Viceroys whom he sent to Ireland were\r\nmore loved and honoured by the Irish people than any Viceroys before\r\nwhom the sword of state has ever been borne. Under the late Government,\r\nno doubt, the empire was threatened by many dangers; but, to whatever\r\nquarter the Ministers might look with uneasy apprehension, to Ireland\r\nthey could always look with confidence. When bad men raised disturbances\r\nhere, when a Chartist rabble fired on the Queen's soldiers, numerous\r\nregiments could, without the smallest risk, be spared from Ireland. When\r\na rebellion broke out in one of our colonies,--a rebellion too which it\r\nmight have been expected that the Irish would regard with favour, for it\r\nwas a rebellion of Roman Catholics against Protestant rulers,--even then\r\nIreland was true to the general interests of the empire, and troops were\r\nsent from Munster and Connaught to put down insurrection in Canada. No\r\nperson will deny that if, in 1840, we had unhappily been forced\r\ninto war, and if a hostile army had landed in Bantry Bay, the whole\r\npopulation of Cork and Tipperary would have risen up to defend the\r\nthrone of Her Majesty, and would have offered to the invaders a\r\nresistance as determined as would have been offered by the men of Kent\r\nor Norfolk. And by what means was this salutary effect produced? Not by\r\ngreat legislative reforms: for, unfortunately, that Government, though\r\nit had the will, had not the power to carry such reforms against the\r\nsense of a strong minority in this House, and of a decided majority\r\nof the Peers. No, Sir; this effect was produced merely by the wisdom,\r\njustice, and humanity with which the existing law, defective as it might\r\nbe, was administered. The late Government, calumniated and thwarted at\r\nevery turn, contending against the whole influence of the Established\r\nChurch, and of the great body of the nobility and landed gentry, yet did\r\nshow a disposition to act kindly and fairly towards Ireland, and did, to\r\nthe best of its power, treat Protestants and Roman Catholics alike. If\r\nwe had been as strong as our successors in parliamentary support, if we\r\nhad been able to induce the two Houses to follow in legislation the same\r\nprinciples by which we were guided in administration, the Union with\r\nIreland would now have been as secure from the assaults of agitators\r\nas the Union with Scotland. But this was not to be. During six years an\r\nopposition, formidable in numbers, formidable in ability, selected as\r\nthe especial object of the fiercest and most pertinacious attacks\r\nthose very acts of the Government which had, after centuries of mutual\r\nanimosity, half reconciled the two islands. Those Lords Lieutenant who,\r\nin Ireland, were venerated as no preceding Lord Lieutenant had ever been\r\nvenerated, were here reviled as no preceding Lord Lieutenant had ever\r\nbeen reviled. Every action, every word which was applauded by the nation\r\ncommitted to their care, was here imputed to them as a crime. Every\r\nbill framed by the advisers of the Crown for the benefit of Ireland was\r\neither rejected or mutilated. A few Roman Catholics of distinguished\r\nmerit were appointed to situations which were indeed below their just\r\nclaims, but which were higher than any member of their Church had filled\r\nduring many generations. Two or three Roman Catholics were sworn of\r\nthe Council; one took his seat at the Board of Treasury; another at the\r\nBoard of Admiralty. There was great joy in Ireland; and no wonder.\r\nWhat had been done was not much; but the ban had been taken off; the\r\nEmancipation Act, which had been little more than a dead letter, was at\r\nlength a reality. But in England all the underlings of the great Tory\r\nparty set up a howl of rage and hatred worthy of Lord George Gordon's\r\nNo Popery mob. The right honourable Baronet now at the head of the\r\nTreasury, with his usual prudence, abstained from joining in the cry,\r\nand was content to listen to it, to enjoy it, and to profit by it. But\r\nsome of those who ranked next to him among the chiefs of the opposition,\r\ndid not imitate his politic reserve. One great man denounced the Irish\r\nas aliens. Another called them minions of Popery. Those teachers of\r\nreligion to whom millions looked up with affection and reverence were\r\ncalled by the Protestant press demon priests and surpliced ruffians, and\r\nwere denounced from the Protestant pulpit as pontiffs of Baal, as false\r\nprophets who were to be slain with the sword. We were reminded that a\r\nQueen of the chosen people had in the old time patronised the ministers\r\nof idolatry, and that her blood had been given to the dogs. Not content\r\nwith throwing out or frittering down every law beneficial to Ireland,\r\nnot content with censuring in severe terms every act of the executive\r\ngovernment which gave satisfaction in Ireland, you, yes you, who now\r\nfill the great offices of state, assumed the offensive. From obstruction\r\nyou proceeded to aggression. You brought in a bill which you called a\r\nBill for the Registration of Electors in Ireland. We then told you that\r\nit was a bill for the wholesale disfranchisement of the electors\r\nof Ireland. We then proved incontrovertibly that, under pretence of\r\nreforming the law of procedure, you were really altering the substantive\r\nlaw; that, by making it impossible for any man to vindicate his right to\r\nvote without trouble, expense, and loss of time, you were really taking\r\naway the votes of tens of thousands. You denied all this then. You very\r\ncoolly admit it all now. Am I to believe that you did know it as well\r\nin 1841 as in 1844? Has one new fact been brought to light? Has one\r\nargument been discovered which was not, three or four years ago, urged\r\ntwenty, thirty, forty times in this House? Why is it that you have,\r\nwhen in power, abstained from proposing that change in the mode of\r\nregistration which, when you were out of power, you represented\r\nas indispensable? You excuse yourselves by saying that now the\r\nresponsibilities of office are upon you. In plain words, your trick\r\nhas served its purpose. Your object,--for I will do justice to your\r\npatriotism,--your object was not to ruin your country, but to get in;\r\nand you are in. Such public virtue deserved such a reward, a reward\r\nwhich has turned out a punishment, a reward which ought to be, while the\r\nworld lasts, a warning to unscrupulous ambition. Many causes contributed\r\nto place you in your present situation. But the chief cause was, beyond\r\nall doubt, the prejudice which you excited amongst the English against\r\nthe just and humane manner in which the late Ministers governed Ireland.\r\nIn your impatience for office, you called up the devil of religious\r\nintolerance, a devil more easily evoked than dismissed. He did your\r\nwork; and he holds your bond. You once found him an useful slave: but\r\nyou have since found him a hard master. It was pleasant, no doubt, to be\r\napplauded by high churchmen and low churchmen, by the Sheldonian Theatre\r\nand by Exeter Hall. It was pleasant to be described as the champions\r\nof the Protestant faith, as the men who stood up for the Gospel against\r\nthat spurious liberality which made no distinction between truth and\r\nfalsehood. It was pleasant to hear your opponents called by every\r\nnickname that is to be found in the foul vocabulary of the Reverend\r\nHugh Mcneill. It was pleasant to hear that they were the allies of\r\nAntichrist, that they were the servants of the man of sin, that they\r\nwere branded with the mark of the Beast. But when all this slander\r\nand scurrility had raised you to power, when you found that you had\r\nto manage millions of those who had been, year after year, constantly\r\ninsulted and defamed by yourselves and your lacqueys, your hearts began\r\nto fail you. Now you tell us that you have none but kind and respectful\r\nfeelings towards the Irish Roman Catholics, that you wish to conciliate\r\nthem, that you wish to carry the Emancipation Act into full effect,\r\nthat nothing would give you more pleasure than to place on the bench of\r\njustice a Roman Catholic lawyer of conservative politics, that nothing\r\nwould give you more pleasure than to place at the Board of Treasury, or\r\nat the Board of Admiralty, some Roman Catholic gentleman of conservative\r\npolitics, distinguished by his talents for business or debate. Your only\r\nreason, you assure us, for not promoting Roman Catholics is that all the\r\nRoman Catholics are your enemies; and you ask whether any Minister can\r\nbe expected to promote his enemies. For my part I do not doubt that you\r\nwould willingly promote Roman Catholics: for, as I have said, I give\r\nyou full credit for not wishing to do your country more harm than is\r\nnecessary for the purpose of turning out and keeping out the Whigs.\r\nI also fully admit that you cannot be blamed for not promoting your\r\nenemies. But what I want to know is, how it happens that all the Roman\r\nCatholics in the United Kingdom are your enemies. Was such a thing\r\never heard of before? Here are six or seven millions of people of all\r\nprofessions, of all trades, of all grades of rank, fortune, intellect,\r\neducation. Begin with the premier Peer, the Earl Marshal of the realm,\r\nthe chief of the Howards, the heir of the Mowbrays and Fitzalans, and\r\ngo down through earls, barons, baronets, lawyers, and merchants, to the\r\nvery poorest peasant that eats his potatoes without salt in Mayo; and\r\nall these millions to a man are arrayed against the Government. How\r\ndo you explain this? Is there any natural connection between the Roman\r\nCatholic theology and the political theories held by Whigs and by\r\nreformers more democratical than the Whigs? Not only is there no natural\r\nconnection, but there is a natural opposition. Of all Christian sects\r\nthe Roman Catholic Church holds highest the authority of antiquity, of\r\ntradition, of immemorial usage. Her spirit is eminently conservative,\r\nnay, in the opinion of all Protestants, conservative to an unreasonable\r\nand pernicious extent. A man who has been taught from childhood to\r\nregard with horror all innovation in religion is surely less likely than\r\nanother man to be a bold innovator in politics. It is probable that a\r\nzealous Roman Catholic, if there were no disturbing cause, would be a\r\nTory; and the Roman Catholics were all Tories till you persecuted them\r\ninto Whiggism and Radicalism. In the civil war, how many Roman Catholics\r\nwere there in Fairfax's army? I believe, not one. They were all under\r\nthe banner of Charles the First. When a reward of five thousand pounds\r\nwas offered for Charles the Second alive or dead, when to conceal\r\nhim was to run a most serious risk of the gallows, it was among\r\nRoman Catholics that he found shelter. It has been the same in other\r\ncountries. When everything else in France was prostrate before the\r\nJacobins, the Roman Catholic peasantry of Brittany and Poitou still\r\nstood up for the House of Bourbon. Against the gigantic power of\r\nNapoleon, the Roman Catholic peasantry of the Tyrol maintained unaided\r\nthe cause of the House of Hapsburg. It would be easy to multiply\r\nexamples. And can we believe, in defiance of all reason and of all\r\nhistory, that, if the Roman Catholics of the United Kingdom had been\r\ntolerably well governed, they would not have been attached to the\r\nGovernment? In my opinion the Tories never committed so great an error\r\nas when they scourged away and spurned away the Roman Catholics. Mr\r\nBurke understood this well. The sentiment which, towards the close\r\nof his life, held the entire possession of his mind, was a horror,--a\r\nmorbid horror it at last became,--of Jacobinism, and of everything that\r\nseemed to him to tend towards Jacobinism, and, like a great statesman\r\nand philosopher,--for such he was even in his errors,--he perceived, and\r\nhe taught Mr Pitt to perceive, that, in the war against Jacobinism, the\r\nRoman Catholics were the natural allies of royalty and aristocracy.\r\nBut the help of these allies was contumeliously rejected by those\r\npoliticians who make themselves ridiculous by carousing on Mr Pitt's\r\nbirthday, while they abjure all Mr Pitt's principles. The consequence\r\nis, as you are forced to own, that there is not in the whole kingdom\r\na Roman Catholic of note who is your friend. Therefore, whatever your\r\ninclinations may be, you must intrust power in Ireland to Protestants,\r\nto Ultra-Protestants, to men who, whether they belong to Orange lodges\r\nor not, are in spirit Orangemen. Every appointment which you make\r\nincreases the discontent of the Roman Catholics. The more discontented\r\nthey are, the less you can venture to employ them. The way in which\r\nyou treated them while you were in opposition has raised in them such a\r\ndislike and distrust of you that you cannot carry the Emancipation Act\r\ninto effect, though, as you tell us, and as I believe, you sincerely\r\ndesire to do so. As respects the offices of which you dispose, that Act\r\nis null and void. Of all the boons which that Act purports to bestow on\r\nRoman Catholics they really enjoy only one, admission to Parliament: and\r\nthat they would not enjoy if you had been able three years ago to carry\r\nyour Irish Registration Bill. You have wounded national feeling: you\r\nhave wounded religious feeling: and the animosity which you have roused\r\nshows itself in a hundred ways, some of which I abhor, some of which I\r\nlament, but at none of which I can wonder. They are the natural effects\r\nof insult and injury on quick and ill regulated sensibility. You, for\r\nyour own purposes, inflamed the public mind of England against Ireland;\r\nand you have no right to be surprised by finding that the public mind\r\nof Ireland is inflamed against England. You called a fourth part of the\r\npeople of the United Kingdom aliens: and you must not blame them for\r\nfeeling and acting like aliens. You have filled every public department\r\nwith their enemies. What then could you expect but that they would\r\nset up against your Lord Lieutenant and your official hierarchy a more\r\npowerful chief and a more powerful organization of their own? They\r\nremember, and it would be strange indeed if they had forgotten, what\r\nunder the same chief, and by a similar organization, they extorted from\r\nyou in 1829; and they are determined to try whether you are bolder and\r\nmore obstinate now than then.\r\n\r\nSuch are the difficulties of this crisis. To a great extent they are\r\nof your own making. And what have you done in order to get out of them?\r\nGreat statesmen have sometimes committed great mistakes, and yet have by\r\nwisdom and firmness extricated themselves from the embarrassments which\r\nthose mistakes had caused. Let us see whether you are entitled to rank\r\namong such statesmen. And first, what,--commanding, as you do, a great\r\nmajority in this and in the other House of Parliament,--what have you\r\ndone in the way of legislation? The answer is very short and simple. The\r\nbeginning and end of all your legislation for Ireland will be found in\r\nthe Arms Act of last session. You will hardly call that conciliation;\r\nand I shall not call it coercion. It was mere petty annoyance. It\r\nsatisfied nobody. We called on you to redress the wrongs of Ireland.\r\nMany of your own friends called on you to stifle her complaints. One\r\nnoble and learned person was so much disgusted by your remissness that\r\nhe employed his own great abilities and his own valuable time in framing\r\na new coercion bill for you. You were deaf alike to us and to him.\r\nThe whole fruit of your legislative wisdom was this one paltry teasing\r\npolice regulation.\r\n\r\nYour executive administration through the whole recess has been one long\r\nblunder. The way in which your Lord Lieutenant and his advisers acted\r\nabout the Clontarf meeting would alone justify a severe vote of censure.\r\nThe noble lord, the Secretary for the Colonies (Lord Stanley.), has told\r\nus that the Government did all that was possible to caution the people\r\nagainst attending that meeting, and that it would be unreasonable to\r\ncensure men for not performing impossibilities. Now, Sir, the ministers\r\nthemselves acknowledge that, as early as the morning of the Friday which\r\npreceded the day fixed for the meeting, the Lord Lieutenant determined\r\nto put forth a proclamation against the meeting. Yet the proclamation\r\nwas not published in Dublin and the suburbs till after nightfall on\r\nSaturday. The meeting was fixed for the Sunday morning. Will any\r\nperson have the hardihood to assert that it was impossible to have a\r\nproclamation drawn up, printed and circulated, in twenty-four hours, nay\r\nin six hours? It is idle to talk of the necessity of weighing well the\r\nwords of such a document. The Lord Lieutenant should have weighed well\r\nthe value of the lives of his royal mistress's subjects. Had he done so,\r\nthere can be no doubt that the proclamation might have been placarded on\r\nevery wall in and near Dublin early in the forenoon of the Saturday. The\r\nnegligence of the Government would probably have caused the loss of many\r\nlives but for the interposition of the man whom you are persecuting.\r\nFortune stood your friend; and he stood your friend; and thus a\r\nslaughter more terrible than that which took place twenty-five years ago\r\nat Manchester was averted.\r\n\r\nBut you were incorrigible. No sooner had you, by strange good luck,\r\ngot out of one scrape, than you made haste to get into another, out of\r\nwhich, as far as I can see, you have no chance of escape. You instituted\r\nthe most unwise, the most unfortunate of all state prosecutions. You\r\nseem not to have at all known what you were doing. It appears never to\r\nhave occurred to you that there was any difference between a criminal\r\nproceeding which was certain to fix the attention of the whole civilised\r\nworld and an ordinary qui tam action for a penalty. The evidence was\r\nsuch and the law such that you were likely to get a verdict and a\r\njudgment; and that was enough for you. Now, Sir, in such a case as this,\r\nthe probability of getting the verdict and the judgment is only a part,\r\nand a very small part, of what a statesman ought to consider. Before you\r\ndetermined to bring the most able, the most powerful, the most popular\r\nof your opponents to the bar as a criminal, on account of the manner in\r\nwhich he had opposed you, you ought to have asked yourselves whether\r\nthe decision which you expected to obtain from the tribunals would be\r\nratified by the voice of your own country, of foreign countries, of\r\nposterity; whether the general opinion of mankind might not be that,\r\nthough you were legally in the right, you were morally in the wrong. It\r\nwas no common person that you were bent on punishing. About that person\r\nI feel, I own, considerable difficulty in saying anything. He is placed\r\nin a situation which would prevent generous enemies, which has prevented\r\nall the members of this House, with one ignominious exception, from\r\nassailing him acrimoniously. I will try, in speaking of him, to pay the\r\nrespect due to eminence and to misfortune without violating the respect\r\ndue to truth. I am convinced that the end which he is pursuing is not\r\nonly mischievous but unattainable: and some of the means which he has\r\nstooped to use for the purpose of attaining that end I regard with deep\r\ndisapprobation. But it is impossible for me not to see that the place\r\nwhich he holds in the estimation of his countrymen is such as no popular\r\nleader in our history, I might perhaps say in the history of the world,\r\nhas ever attained. Nor is the interest which he inspires confined to\r\nIreland or to the United Kingdom. Go where you will on the Continent:\r\nvisit any coffee house: dine at any public table: embark on board of any\r\nsteamboat: enter any diligence, any railway carriage: from the moment\r\nthat your accent shows you to be an Englishman, the very first question\r\nasked by your companions, be they what they may, physicians, advocates,\r\nmerchants, manufacturers, or what we should call yeomen, is certain to\r\nbe \"What will be done with Mr O'Connell?\" Look over any file of French\r\njournals; and you will see what a space he occupies in the eyes of the\r\nFrench people. It is most unfortunate, but it is a truth, and a\r\ntruth which we ought always to bear in mind, that there is among our\r\nneighbours a feeling about the connection between England and Ireland\r\nnot very much unlike the feeling which exists here about the connection\r\nbetween Russia and Poland. All the sympathies of all continental\r\npoliticians are with the Irish. We are regarded as the oppressors, and\r\nthe Irish as the oppressed. An insurrection in Ireland would have the\r\ngood wishes of a great majority of the people of Europe. And, Sir, it is\r\nnatural that it should be so. For the cause of the Irish repealers has\r\ntwo different aspects, a democratic aspect, and a Roman Catholic aspect,\r\nand is therefore regarded with favour by foreigners of almost\r\nevery shade of opinion. The extreme left,--to use the French\r\nnomenclature,--wishes success to a great popular movement against\r\nthe throne and the aristocracy. The extreme right wishes success to a\r\nmovement headed by the bishops and priests of the true Church against a\r\nheretical government and a heretical hierarchy. The consequence is that,\r\nin a contest with Ireland, you will not have, out of this island,\r\na single well-wisher in the world. I do not say this in order to\r\nintimidate you. But I do say that, on an occasion on which all\r\nChristendom was watching your conduct with an unfriendly and suspicious\r\neye, you should have carefully avoided everything that looked like foul\r\nplay. Unhappily you were too much bent on gaining the victory; and you\r\nhave gained a victory more disgraceful and disastrous than any defeat.\r\nMr O'Connell has been convicted: but you cannot deny that he has been\r\nwronged: you cannot deny that irregularities have been committed, or\r\nthat the effect of those irregularities has been to put you in a better\r\nsituation and him in a worse situation than the law contemplated. It is\r\nadmitted that names which ought to have been in the jury-list were not\r\nthere. It is admitted that all, or almost all, the names which were\r\nwrongfully excluded were the names of Roman Catholics. As to the\r\nnumber of those who were wrongfully excluded there is some dispute. An\r\naffidavit has been produced which puts the number at twenty-seven. The\r\nright honourable gentleman, the Recorder of Dublin, who of course puts\r\nthe number as low as he conscientiously can, admits twenty-four.\r\nBut some gentlemen maintain that this irregularity, though doubtless\r\nblamable, cannot have had any effect on the event of the trial. What,\r\nthey ask, are twenty or twenty-seven names in seven hundred and twenty?\r\nWhy, Sir, a very simple arithmetical calculation will show that the\r\nirregularity was of grave importance. Of the seven hundred and twenty,\r\nforty-eight were to be selected by lot, and then reduced by alternate\r\nstriking to twelve. The forty-eighth part of seven hundred and twenty is\r\nfifteen. If, therefore, there had been fifteen more Roman Catholics in\r\nthe jury-list, it would have been an even chance that there would have\r\nbeen one Roman Catholic more among the forty-eight. If there had been\r\ntwenty-seven more Roman Catholics in the list, it would have been almost\r\nan even chance that there would have been two Roman Catholics more among\r\nthe forty-eight. Is it impossible, is it improbable that, but for this\r\ntrick or this blunder,--I will not now inquire which,--the result of the\r\ntrial might have been different? For, remember the power which the law\r\ngives to a single juror. He can, if his mind is fully made up, prevent\r\na conviction. I heard murmurs when I used the word trick. Am I not\r\njustified in feeling a doubt which it is quite evident that Mr Justice\r\nPerrin feels? He is reported to have said,--and I take the report of\r\nnewspapers favourable to the Government,--he is reported to have said\r\nthat there had been great carelessness, great neglect of duty, that\r\nthere were circumstances which raised grave suspicion, and that he was\r\nnot prepared to say that the irregularity was accidental. The noble lord\r\nthe Secretary for the Colonies has admonished us to pay respect to the\r\njudges. I am sure that I pay the greatest respect to everything that\r\nfalls from Mr Justice Perrin. He must know much better than I, much\r\nbetter than any Englishman, what artifices are likely to be employed by\r\nIrish functionaries for the purpose of packing a jury; and he tells us\r\nthat he is not satisfied that this irregularity was the effect of mere\r\ninadvertence. But, says the right honourable Baronet, the Secretary for\r\nthe Home Department, \"I am not responsible for this irregularity.\" Most\r\ntrue: and nobody holds the right honourable Baronet responsible for it.\r\nBut he goes on to say, \"I lament this irregularity most sincerely: for\r\nI believe that it has raised a prejudice against the administration of\r\njustice.\" Exactly so. That is just what I say. I say that a prejudice\r\nhas been created against the administration of justice. I say that\r\na taint of suspicion has been thrown on the verdict which you have\r\nobtained. And I ask whether it is right and decent in you to avail\r\nyourselves of a verdict on which such a taint has been thrown? The only\r\nwise, the only honourable course open to you was to say, \"A mistake has\r\nbeen committed: that mistake has given us an unfair advantage; and of\r\nthat advantage we will not make use.\" Unhappily, the time when you might\r\nhave taken this course, and might thus to a great extent have repaired\r\nyour former errors, has been suffered to elapse.\r\n\r\nWell, you had forty-eight names taken by lot from this mutilated\r\njury-list: and then came the striking. You struck out all the Roman\r\nCatholic names: and you give us your reasons for striking out these\r\nnames, reasons which I do not think it worth while to examine. The real\r\nquestion which you should have considered was this: Can a great issue\r\nbetween two hostile religions,--for such the issue was,--be tried in a\r\nmanner above all suspicion by a jury composed exclusively of men of one\r\nof those religions? I know that in striking out the Roman Catholics\r\nyou did nothing that was not according to technical rules. But my great\r\ncharge against you is that you have looked on this whole case in a\r\ntechnical point of view, that you have been attorneys when you should\r\nhave been statesmen. The letter of the law was doubtless with you; but\r\nnot the noble spirit of the law. The jury de medietate linguae is of\r\nimmemorial antiquity among us. Suppose that a Dutch sailor at Wapping is\r\naccused of stabbing an Englishman in a brawl. The fate of the culprit is\r\ndecided by a mixed body, by six Englishmen and six Dutchmen. Such were\r\nthe securities which the wisdom and justice of our ancestors gave to\r\naliens. You are ready enough to call Mr O'Connell an alien when it\r\nserves your purposes to do so. You are ready enough to inflict on the\r\nIrish Roman Catholic all the evils of alienage. But the one privilege,\r\nthe one advantage of alienage, you deny him. In a case which of all\r\ncases most require a jury de medietate, in a case which sprang out of\r\nthe mutual hostility of races and sects, you pack a jury all of one\r\nrace and all of one sect. Why, if you were determined to go on with this\r\nunhappy prosecution, not have a common jury? There was no difficulty\r\nin having such a jury; and among the jurors might have been some\r\nrespectable Roman Catholics who were not members of the Repeal\r\nAssociation. A verdict of Not Guilty from such a jury would have done\r\nyou infinitely less harm than the verdict of Guilty which you have\r\nsucceeded in obtaining. Yes, you have obtained a verdict of Guilty;\r\nbut you have obtained that verdict from twelve men brought together by\r\nillegal means, and selected in such a manner that their decision can\r\ninspire no confidence. You have obtained that verdict by the help of a\r\nChief Justice of whose charge I can hardly trust myself to speak. To do\r\nhim right, however, I will say that his charge was not, as it has been\r\ncalled, unprecedented; for it bears a very close resemblance to some\r\ncharges which may be found in the state trials of the reign of Charles\r\nthe Second. However, with this jury-list, with this jury, with this\r\njudge, you have a verdict. And what have you gained by it? Have you\r\npacified Ireland? No doubt there is just at the present moment an\r\napparent tranquillity; but it is a tranquillity more alarming than\r\nturbulence. The Irish will be quiet till you begin to put the sentence\r\nof imprisonment into execution, because, feeling the deepest interest in\r\nthe fate of their persecuted Tribune, they will do nothing that can be\r\nprejudicial to him. But will they be quiet when the door of a gaol has\r\nbeen closed on him? Is it possible to believe that an agitator, whom\r\nthey adored while his agitation was a source of profit to him, will lose\r\nhis hold on their affections by being a martyr in what they consider as\r\ntheir cause? If I, who am strongly attached to the Union, who believe\r\nthat the Repeal of the Union would be fatal to the empire, and who think\r\nMr O'Connell's conduct highly reprehensible, cannot conscientiously say\r\nthat he has had a fair trial, if the prosecutors themselves are forced\r\nto own that things have happened which have excited a prejudice against\r\nthe verdict and the judgment, what must be the feelings of the people of\r\nIreland, who believe not merely that he is guiltless, but that he is the\r\nbest friend that they ever had? He will no longer be able to harangue\r\nthem: but his wrongs will stir their blood more than his eloquence ever\r\ndid; nor will he in confinement be able to exercise that influence which\r\nhas so often restrained them, even in their most excited mood, from\r\nproceeding to acts of violence.\r\n\r\nTurn where we will, the prospect is gloomy; and that which of all things\r\nmost disturbs me is this, that your experience, sharp as it has been,\r\ndoes not seem to have made you wiser. All that I have been able to\r\ncollect from your declarations leads me to apprehend that, while you\r\ncontinue to hold power, the future will be of a piece with the past. As\r\nto your executive administration, you hold out no hope that it will\r\nbe other than it has been. If we look back, your only remedies for the\r\ndisorders of Ireland have been an impolitic state prosecution, an unfair\r\nstate trial, barracks and soldiers. If we look forward, you promise\r\nus no remedies but an unjust sentence, the harsh execution of that\r\nsentence, more barracks and more soldiers.\r\n\r\nYou do indeed try to hold out hopes of one or two legislative reforms\r\nbeneficial to Ireland; but these hopes, I am afraid, will prove\r\ndelusive. You hint that you have prepared a Registration bill, of which\r\nthe effect will be to extend the elective franchise. What the provisions\r\nof that bill may be we do not know. But this we know, that the matter\r\nis one about which it is utterly impossible for you to do anything that\r\nshall be at once honourable to yourselves and useful to the country.\r\nBefore we see your plan, we can say with perfect confidence that it must\r\neither destroy the last remnant of the representative system in Ireland,\r\nor the last remnant of your own character for consistency.\r\n\r\nAbout the much agitated question of land tenure you acknowledge that\r\nyou have at present nothing to propose. We are to have a report, but you\r\ncannot tell us when.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Church, as at present constituted and endowed, you are fully\r\ndetermined to uphold. On some future occasion, I hope to be able to\r\nexplain at large my views on that subject. To-night I have exhausted\r\nmy own strength, and I have exhausted also, I am afraid, the kind\r\nindulgence of the House. I will therefore only advert very briefly to\r\nsome things which have been said about the Church in the course of the\r\npresent debate.\r\n\r\nSeveral gentlemen opposite have spoken of the religious discord which is\r\nthe curse of Ireland in language which does them honour; and I am only\r\nsorry that we are not to have their votes as well as their speeches.\r\nBut from the Treasury bench we have heard nothing but this, that the\r\nEstablished Church is there, and that there it must and shall remain. As\r\nto the speech of the noble lord the Secretary for the Colonies, really\r\nwhen we hear such a pitiable defence of a great institution from a\r\nman of such eminent abilities, what inference can we draw but that the\r\ninstitution is altogether indefensible? The noble lord tells us that the\r\nRoman Catholics, in 1757, when they were asking to be relieved from the\r\npenal laws, and in 1792, when they were asking to be relieved from civil\r\ndisabilities, professed to be quite willing that the Established Church\r\nshould retain its endowments. What is it to us, Sir, whether they did or\r\nnot? If you can prove this Church to be a good institution, of course\r\nit ought to be maintained. But do you mean to say that a bad institution\r\nought to be maintained because some people who have been many years in\r\ntheir graves said that they did not complain of it? What if the Roman\r\nCatholics of the present generation hold a different language on\r\nthis subject from the Roman Catholics of the last generation? Is this\r\ninconsistency, which appears to shock the noble lord, anything but the\r\nnatural and inevitable progress of all reform? People who are oppressed,\r\nand who have no hope of obtaining entire justice, beg to be relieved\r\nfrom the most galling part of what they suffer. They assure the\r\noppressor that if he will only relax a little of his severity they shall\r\nbe quite content; and perhaps, at the time, they believe that they shall\r\nbe content. But are expressions of this sort, are mere supplications\r\nuttered under duress, to estop every person who utters them, and all\r\nhis posterity to the end of time, from asking for entire justice? Am I\r\ndebarred from trying to recover property of which I have been robbed,\r\nbecause, when the robber's pistol was at my breast, I begged him to take\r\neverything that I had and to spare my life? The noble lord knows\r\nwell that, while the slave trade existed, the great men who exerted\r\nthemselves to put an end to that trade disclaimed all thought of\r\nemancipating the negroes. In those days, Mr Pitt, Mr Fox, Lord\r\nGrenville, Lord Grey, and even my dear and honoured friend of whom I can\r\nnever speak without emotion, Mr Wilberforce, always said that it was a\r\ncalumny to accuse them of intending to liberate the black population of\r\nthe sugar islands. In 1807 the present Duke of Northumberland, then\r\nLord Percy, in the generous enthusiasm of youth, rose to propose in\r\nthis House the abolition of slavery. Mr Wilberforce interposed, nay, I\r\nbelieve, almost pulled Lord Percy down. Nevertheless in 1833 the\r\nnoble lord the Secretary for the Colonies brought in a bill to abolish\r\nslavery. Suppose that when he resumed his seat, after making that most\r\neloquent speech in which he explained his plan to us, some West Indian\r\nplanter had risen, and had said that in 1792, in 1796, in 1807, all the\r\nleading philanthropists had solemnly declared that they had no intention\r\nof emancipating the negroes; would not the noble lord have answered that\r\nnothing that had been said by anybody in 1792 or 1807 could bind us not\r\nto do what was right in 1833?\r\n\r\nThis is not the only point on which the noble lord's speech is quite at\r\nvariance with his own conduct. He appeals to the fifth article of the\r\nTreaty of Union. He says that, if we touch the revenues and privileges\r\nof the Established Church, we shall violate that article; and to violate\r\nan article of the Treaty of Union is, it seems, a breach of public faith\r\nof which he cannot bear to think. But, Sir, why is the fifth article\r\nto be held more sacred than the fourth, which fixes the number of Irish\r\nmembers who are to sit in this House? The fourth article, we all\r\nknow, has been altered. And who brought in the bill which altered that\r\narticle? The noble lord himself.\r\n\r\nThen the noble lord adverts to the oath taken by Roman Catholic members\r\nof this House. They bind themselves, he says, not to use their power\r\nfor the purpose of injuring the Established Church. I am sorry that the\r\nnoble lord is not at this moment in the House. Had he been here I should\r\nhave made some remarks which I now refrain from making on one or two\r\nexpressions which fell from him. But, Sir, let us allow to his argument\r\nall the weight which he can himself claim for it. What does it prove?\r\nNot that the Established Church of Ireland is a good institution; not\r\nthat it ought to be maintained; but merely this, that, when we are about\r\nto divide on the question whether it shall be maintained, the Roman\r\nCatholic members ought to walk away to the library. The oath which they\r\nhave taken is nothing to me and to the other Protestant members who have\r\nnot taken it. Suppose then our Roman Catholic friends withdrawn. Suppose\r\nthat we, the six hundred and twenty or thirty Protestant members remain\r\nin the House. Then there is an end of this argument about the oath. Will\r\nthe noble lord then be able to give us any reason for maintaining the\r\nChurch of Ireland on the present footing?\r\n\r\nI hope, Sir, that the right honourable Baronet the first Lord of the\r\nTreasury will not deal with this subject as his colleagues have dealt\r\nwith it. We have a right to expect that a man of his capacity, placed\r\nat the head of government, will attempt to defend the Irish Church in\r\na manly and rational way. I would beg him to consider these\r\nquestions:--For what ends do Established Churches exist? Does the\r\nEstablished Church of Ireland accomplish those ends or any one of those\r\nends? Can an Established Church which has no hold on the hearts of the\r\nbody of the people be otherwise than useless, or worse than useless? Has\r\nthe Established Church of Ireland any hold on the hearts of the body\r\nof the people? Has it been successful in making proselytes? Has it been\r\nwhat the Established Church of England has been with justice called,\r\nwhat the Established Church of Scotland was once with at least equal\r\njustice called, the poor man's Church? Has it trained the great body\r\nof the people to virtue, consoled them in affliction, commanded their\r\nreverence, attached them to itself and to the State? Show that these\r\nquestions can be answered in the affirmative; and you will have\r\nmade, what I am sure has never yet been made, a good defence of the\r\nEstablished Church of Ireland. But it is mere mockery to bring us\r\nquotations from forgotten speeches, and from mouldy petitions presented\r\nto George the Second at a time when the penal laws were still in full\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Sir, I must stop. I have said enough to justify the vote which\r\nI shall give in favour of the motion of my noble friend. I have shown,\r\nunless I deceive myself, that the extraordinary disorders which now\r\nalarm us in Ireland have been produced by the fatal policy of the\r\nGovernment. I have shown that the mode in which the Government is now\r\ndealing with those disorders is far more likely to inflame than to allay\r\nthem. While this system lasts, Ireland can never be tranquil; and till\r\nIreland is tranquil, England can never hold her proper place among the\r\nnations of the world. To the dignity, to the strength, to the safety of\r\nthis great country, internal peace is indispensably necessary. In every\r\nnegotiation, whether with France on the right of search, or with America\r\non the line of boundary, the fact that Ireland is discontented is\r\nuppermost in the minds of the diplomatists on both sides, making the\r\nrepresentative of the British Crown timorous, and making his adversary\r\nbold. And no wonder. This is indeed a great and splendid empire, well\r\nprovided with the means both of annoyance and of defence. England can do\r\nmany things which are beyond the power of any other nation in the world.\r\nShe has dictated peace to China. She rules Caffraria and Australasia.\r\nShe could again sweep from the ocean all commerce but her own. She could\r\nagain blockade every port from the Baltic to the Adriatic. She is able\r\nto guard her vast Indian dominions against all hostility by land or\r\nsea. But in this gigantic body there is one vulnerable spot near to the\r\nheart. At that spot forty-six years ago a blow was aimed which narrowly\r\nmissed, and which, if it had not missed, might have been deadly. The\r\ngovernment and the legislature, each in its own sphere, is deeply\r\nresponsible for the continuance of a state of things which is fraught\r\nwith danger to the State. From my share of that responsibility I shall\r\nclear myself by the vote which I am about to give; and I trust that the\r\nnumber and the respectability of those in whose company I shall go into\r\nthe lobby will be such as to convince the Roman Catholics of Ireland\r\nthat they need not yet relinquish all hope of obtaining relief from the\r\nwisdom and justice of an Imperial Parliament.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISSENTERS' CHAPELS BILL. (JUNE 6, 1844) A SPEECH DELIVERED IN THE HOUSE\r\nOF COMMONS ON THE 6TH OF JUNE 1844.\r\n\r\nAn attempt having been made to deprive certain dissenting congregations\r\nof property which they had long enjoyed, on the ground that they did not\r\nhold the same religious opinions that had been held by the purchasers\r\nfrom whom they derived their title to that property, the Government of\r\nSir Robert Peel brought in a bill fixing a time of limitation in such\r\ncases. The time fixed was twenty-five years.\r\n\r\nThe bill, having passed the Lords, came down to the House of Commons.\r\nOn the sixth of June 1844, the second reading was moved by the Attorney\r\nGeneral, Sir William Follett. Sir Robert Inglis, Member for the\r\nUniversity of Oxford, moved that the bill should be read a second time\r\nthat day six months: and the amendment was seconded by Mr Plumptre,\r\nMember for Kent. Early in the debate the following Speech was made.\r\n\r\nThe second reading was carried by 307 votes to 117.\r\n\r\nIf, Sir, I should unhappily fail in preserving that tone in which the\r\nquestion before us ought to be debated, it will assuredly not be for\r\nwant either of an example or of a warning. The honourable and learned\r\nMember who moved the second reading has furnished me with a model which\r\nI cannot too closely imitate; and from the honourable Member for Kent,\r\nif I can learn nothing else, I may at least learn what temper and what\r\nstyle I ought most carefully to avoid.\r\n\r\nI was very desirous, Sir, to catch your eye, not because I was so\r\npresumptuous as to hope that I should be able to add much to the\r\npowerful and luminous argument of the honourable and learned gentleman\r\nwho has, to our great joy, again appeared among us to-night; but because\r\nI thought it desirable that, at an early period in the debate, some\r\nperson whose seat is on this side of the House, some person strongly\r\nopposed to the policy of the present Government, should say, what I\r\nnow say with all my heart, that this is a bill highly honourable to\r\nthe Government, a bill framed on the soundest principles, and evidently\r\nintroduced from the best and purest motives. This praise is a tribute\r\ndue to Her Majesty's Ministers; and I have great pleasure in paying it.\r\n\r\nI have great pleasure also in bearing my testimony to the humanity, the\r\nmoderation, and the decorum with which my honourable friend the Member\r\nfor the University of Oxford has expressed his sentiments. I must\r\nparticularly applaud the resolution which he announced, and to which he\r\nstrictly adhered, of treating this question as a question of meum and\r\ntuum, and not as a question of orthodoxy and heterodoxy. With him it is\r\npossible to reason. But how am I to reason with the honourable Member\r\nfor Kent, who has made a speech without one fact, one argument, one\r\nshadow of an argument, a speech made up of nothing but vituperation? I\r\ngrieve to say that the same bitterness of theological animosity which\r\ncharacterised that speech may be discerned in too many of the petitions\r\nwith which, as he boasts, our table has been heaped day after day. The\r\nhonourable Member complains that those petitions have not been treated\r\nwith proper respect. Sir, they have been treated with much more respect\r\nthan they deserved. He asks why we are to suppose that the petitioners\r\nare not competent to form a judgment on this question? My answer is,\r\nthat they have certified their incompetence under their own hands. They\r\nhave, with scarcely one exception, treated this question as a question\r\nof divinity, though it is purely a question of property: and when I see\r\nmen treat a question of property as if it were a question of divinity, I\r\nam certain that, however numerous they may be, their opinion is entitled\r\nto no consideration. If the persons whom this bill is meant to relieve\r\nare orthodox, that is no reason for our plundering anybody else in\r\norder to enrich them. If they are heretics, that is no reason for our\r\nplundering them in order to enrich others. I should not think myself\r\njustified in supporting this bill, if I could not with truth declare\r\nthat, whatever sect had been in possession of these chapels, my conduct\r\nwould have been precisely the same. I have no peculiar sympathy with\r\nUnitarians. If these people, instead of being Unitarians, had been Roman\r\nCatholics, or Wesleyan Methodists, or General Baptists, or Particular\r\nBaptists, or members of the Old Secession Church of Scotland, or members\r\nof the Free Church of Scotland, I should speak as I now speak, and vote\r\nas I now mean to vote.\r\n\r\nSir, the whole dispute is about the second clause of this bill. I can\r\nhardly conceive that any gentleman will vote against the bill on account\r\nof the error in the marginal note on the third clause. To the first\r\nclause my honourable friend the Member for the University of Oxford\r\nsaid, if I understood him rightly, that he had no objection; and indeed\r\na man of his integrity and benevolence could hardly say less after\r\nlistening to the lucid and powerful argument of the Attorney General. It\r\nis therefore on the second clause that the whole question turns.\r\n\r\nThe second clause, Sir, rests on a principle simple, well-known, and\r\nmost important to the welfare of all classes of the community. That\r\nprinciple is this, that prescription is a good title to property, that\r\nthere ought to be a time of limitation, after which a possessor,\r\nin whatever way his possession may have originated, must not be\r\ndispossessed. Till very lately, Sir, I could not have imagined that,\r\nin any assembly of reasonable, civilised, of educated men, it could be\r\nnecessary for me to stand up in defence of that principle. I should have\r\nthought it as much a waste of the public time to make a speech on such\r\na subject as to make a speech against burning witches, against trying\r\nwrits of right by wager of battle, or against requiring a culprit to\r\nprove his innocence by walking over red-hot ploughshares. But I find\r\nthat I was in error. Certain sages, lately assembled in conclave at\r\nExeter Hall, have done me the honour to communicate to me the fruits of\r\ntheir profound meditations on the science of legislation. They have,\r\nit seems, passed a resolution declaring that the principle, which I had\r\nsupposed that no man out of Bedlam would ever question, is an untenable\r\nprinciple, and altogether unworthy of a British Parliament. They have\r\nbeen pleased to add, that the present Government cannot, without gross\r\ninconsistency, call on Parliament to pass a statute of limitation.\r\nAnd why? Will the House believe it? Because the present Government has\r\nappointed two new Vice Chancellors.\r\n\r\nReally, Sir, I do not know whether the opponents of this bill shine\r\nmore as logicians or as jurists. Standing here as the advocate of\r\nprescription, I ought not to forget that prescriptive right of talking\r\nnonsense which gentlemen who stand on the platform of Exeter Hall are\r\nundoubtedly entitled to claim. But, though I recognise the right, I\r\ncannot but think that it may be abused, and that it has been abused on\r\nthe present occasion. One thing at least is clear, that, if Exeter Hall\r\nbe in the right, all the masters of political philosophy, all the great\r\nlegislators, all the systems of law by which men are and have been\r\ngoverned in all civilised countries, from the earliest times, must be\r\nin the wrong. How indeed can any society prosper, or even exist, without\r\nthe aid of this untenable principle, this principle unworthy of a\r\nBritish legislature? This principle was found in the Athenian law. This\r\nprinciple was found in the Roman law. This principle was found in the\r\nlaws of all those nations of which the jurisprudence was derived from\r\nRome. This principle was found in the law administered by the Parliament\r\nof Paris; and, when that Parliament and the law which it administered\r\nhad been swept away by the revolution, this principle reappeared in\r\nthe Code Napoleon. Go westward, and you find this principle recognised\r\nbeyond the Mississippi. Go eastward, and you find it recognised beyond\r\nthe Indus, in countries which never heard the name of Justinian, in\r\ncountries to which no translation of the Pandects ever found its way.\r\nLook into our own laws, and you will see that the principle, which is\r\nnow designated as unworthy of Parliament, has guided Parliament ever\r\nsince Parliament existed. Our first statute of limitation was enacted\r\nat Merton, by men some of whom had borne a part in extorting the Great\r\nCharter and the Forest Charter from King John. From that time to this\r\nit has been the study of a succession of great lawyers and statesmen to\r\nmake the limitation more and more stringent. The Crown and the Church\r\nindeed were long exempted from the general rule. But experience fully\r\nproved that every such exemption was an evil; and a remedy was at last\r\napplied. Sir George Savile, the model of English country gentlemen, was\r\nthe author of the Act which barred the claims of the Crown. That eminent\r\nmagistrate, the late Lord Tenterden, was the author of the Act which\r\nbarred the claims of the Church. Now, Sir, how is it possible to believe\r\nthat the Barons, whose seals are upon our Great Charter, would\r\nhave perfectly agreed with the great jurists who framed the Code of\r\nJustinian, with the great jurists who framed the Code of Napoleon, with\r\nthe most learned English lawyers of the nineteenth century, and with the\r\nPundits of Benares, unless there had been some strong and clear reason\r\nwhich necessarily led men of sense in every age and country to the same\r\nconclusion? Nor is it difficult to see what the reason was. For it is\r\nevident that the principle which silly and ignorant fanatics have called\r\nuntenable is essential to the institution of property, and that, if you\r\ntake away that principle, you will produce evils resembling those which\r\nwould be produced by a general confiscation. Imagine what would follow\r\nif the maxims of Exeter Hall were introduced into Westminster Hall.\r\nImagine a state of things in which one of us should be liable to be sued\r\non a bill of exchange indorsed by his grandfather in 1760. Imagine a\r\nman possessed of an estate and manor house which had descended to him\r\nthrough ten or twelve generations of ancestors, and yet liable to be\r\nejected because some flaw had been detected in a deed executed three\r\nhundred years ago, in the reign of Henry the Eighth. Why, Sir, should\r\nwe not all cry out that it would be better to live under the rule of\r\na Turkish Pasha than under such a system. Is it not plain that the\r\nenforcing of an obsolete right is the inflicting of a wrong? Is it\r\nnot plain that, but for our statutes of limitation, a lawsuit would be\r\nmerely a grave, methodical robbery? I am ashamed to argue a point so\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nAnd if this be the general rule, why should the case which we are\r\nnow considering be an exception to that rule? I have done my best\r\nto understand why. I have read much bad oratory, and many foolish\r\npetitions. I have heard with attention the reasons of my honourable\r\nfriend the Member for the University of Oxford; and I should have heard\r\nthe reasons of the honourable Member for Kent, if there had been any to\r\nhear. Every argument by which my honourable friend the Member for the\r\nUniversity of Oxford tried to convince us that this case is an exception\r\nto the general rule, will be found on examination to be an argument\r\nagainst the general rule itself. He says that the possession which we\r\npropose to sanction was originally a wrongful possession. Why, Sir, all\r\nthe statutes of limitation that ever were made sanction possession which\r\nwas originally wrongful. It is for the protection of possessors who are\r\nnot in condition to prove that their possession was originally rightful\r\nthat statutes of limitation are passed. Then my honourable friend\r\nsays that this is an ex post facto law. Why, Sir, so are all our great\r\nstatutes of limitation. Look at the Statute of Merton, passed in 1235;\r\nat the Statute of Westminster, passed in 1275; at the Statute of James\r\nthe First, passed in 1623; at Sir George Savile's Act, passed in the\r\nlast century; at Lord Tenterden's Act, passed in our own time. Every one\r\nof those Acts was retrospective. Every one of them barred claims arising\r\nout of past transactions. Nor was any objection ever raised to what\r\nwas so evidently just and wise, till bigotry and chicanery formed that\r\ndisgraceful league against which we are now contending. But, it is said,\r\nit is unreasonable to grant a boon to men because they have been many\r\nyears doing wrong. The length of the time during which they have enjoyed\r\nproperty not rightfully their own, is an aggravation of the injury which\r\nthey have committed, and is so far from being a reason for letting them\r\nenjoy that property for ever, that it is rather a reason for compelling\r\nthem to make prompt restitution. With this childish sophistry the\r\npetitions on our table are filled. Is it possible that any man can be\r\nso dull as not to perceive that, if this be a reason, it is a reason\r\nagainst all our statutes of limitation? I do a greater wrong to my\r\ntailor if I withhold payment of his bill during six years than if I\r\nwithhold payment only during two years. Yet the law says that at the\r\nend of two years he may bring an action and force me to pay him with\r\ninterest, but that after the lapse of six years he cannot force me to\r\npay him at all. It is much harder that a family should be kept out of\r\nits hereditary estate during five generations than during five days.\r\nBut if you are kept out of your estate five days you have your action of\r\nejectment; and, after the lapse of five generations, you have no remedy.\r\nI say, therefore, with confidence, that every argument which has been\r\nurged against this bill is an argument against the great principle of\r\nprescription. I go further, and I say that, if there be any case which,\r\nin an especial manner, calls for the application of the principle of\r\nprescription, this is that case. For the Unitarian congregations have\r\nlaid out so much on these little spots of ground that it is impossible\r\nto take the soil from them without taking from them property which is of\r\nmuch greater value than the mere soil, and which is indisputably their\r\nown. This is not the case of a possessor who has been during many years,\r\nreceiving great emoluments from land to which he had not a good title.\r\nIt is the case of a possessor who has, from resources which were\r\nundoubtedly his own, expended on the land much more than it was\r\noriginally worth. Even in the former case, it has been the policy of all\r\nwise lawgivers to fix a time of limitation. A fortiori, therefore, there\r\nought to be a time of limitation in the latter case.\r\n\r\nAnd here, Sir, I cannot help asking gentlemen to compare the petitions\r\nfor this bill with the petitions against it. Never was there such a\r\ncontrast. The petitions against the bill are filled with cant, rant,\r\nscolding, scraps of bad sermons. The petitions in favour of the bill\r\nset forth in the simplest manner great practical grievances. Take, for\r\ninstance, the case of Cirencester. The meeting house there was built in\r\n1730. It is certain that the Unitarian doctrines were taught there as\r\nearly as 1742. That was only twelve years after the chapel had been\r\nfounded. Many of the original subscribers must have been living. Many\r\nof the present congregation are lineal descendants of the original\r\nsubscribers. Large sums have from time to time been laid out in\r\nrepairing, enlarging, and embellishing the edifice; and yet there are\r\npeople who think it just and reasonable that this congregation should,\r\nafter the lapse of more than a century, be turned out. At Norwich,\r\nagain, a great dissenting meeting house was opened in 1688. It is not\r\neasy to say how soon Anti-Trinitarian doctrines were taught there. The\r\nchange of sentiment in the congregation seems to have been gradual: but\r\nit is quite certain that, in 1754, ninety years ago, both pastor and\r\nflock were decidedly Unitarian. Round the chapel is a cemetery filled\r\nwith the monuments of eminent Unitarians. Attached to the chapel are a\r\nschoolhouse and a library, built and fitted up by Unitarians. And now\r\nthe occupants find that their title is disputed. They cannot venture to\r\nbuild; they cannot venture to repair; and they are anxiously awaiting\r\nour decision. I do not know that I have cited the strongest cases. I\r\nam giving you the ordinary history of these edifices. Go to Manchester.\r\nUnitarianism has been taught there at least seventy years in a chapel\r\non which the Unitarians have expended large sums. Go to Leeds. Four\r\nthousand pounds have been subscribed for the repairing of the Unitarian\r\nchapel there, the chapel where, near eighty years ago, Priestly, the\r\ngreat Doctor of the sect, officiated. But these four thousand pounds are\r\nlying idle. Not a pew can be repaired till it is known whether this bill\r\nwill become law. Go to Maidstone. There Unitarian doctrines have been\r\ntaught during at least seventy years; and seven hundred pounds have\r\nrecently been laid out by the congregation in repairing the chapel.\r\nGo to Exeter. It matters not where you go. But go to Exeter. There\r\nUnitarian doctrines have been preached more than eighty years; and two\r\nthousand pounds have been laid out on the chapel. It is the same\r\nat Coventry, at Bath, at Yarmouth, everywhere. And will a British\r\nParliament rob the possessors of these buildings? I can use no other\r\nword. How should we feel if it were proposed to deprive any other class\r\nof men of land held during so long a time, and improved at so large a\r\ncost? And, if this property should be transferred to those who covet it,\r\nwhat would they gain in comparison with what the present occupants would\r\nlose? The pulpit of Priestley, the pulpit of Lardner, are objects\r\nof reverence to congregations which hold the tenets of Priestley and\r\nLardner. To the intruders those pulpits will be nothing; nay, worse than\r\nnothing; memorials of heresiarchs. Within these chapels and all around\r\nthem are the tablets which the pious affection of four generations\r\nhas placed over the remains of dear mothers and sisters, wives and\r\ndaughters, of eloquent preachers, of learned theological writers. To\r\nthe Unitarian, the building which contains these memorials is a hallowed\r\nbuilding. To the intruder it is of no more value than any other room\r\nin which he can find a bench to sit on and a roof to cover him. If,\r\ntherefore, we throw out this bill, we do not merely rob one set of\r\npeople in order to make a present to another set. That would be bad\r\nenough. But we rob the Unitarians of that which they regard as a most\r\nprecious treasure; of that which is endeared to them by the strongest\r\nreligious and the strongest domestic associations; of that which cannot\r\nbe wrenched from them without inflicting on them the bitterest pain and\r\nhumiliation. To the Trinitarians we give that which can to them be of\r\nlittle or no value except as a trophy of a most inglorious victory won\r\nin a most unjust war.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, an imputation of fraud has been thrown on the Unitarians;\r\nnot, indeed, here, but in many other places, and in one place of which\r\nI would always wish to speak with respect. The Unitarians, it has\r\nbeen said, knew that the original founders of these chapels were\r\nTrinitarians; and to use, for the purpose of propagating Unitarian\r\ndoctrine, a building erected for the purpose of propagating Trinitarian\r\ndoctrine was grossly dishonest. One very eminent person (The Bishop\r\nof London.) has gone so far as to maintain that the Unitarians cannot\r\npretend to any prescription of more than sixty-three years; and he\r\nproves his point thus:--Till the year 1779, he says, no dissenting\r\nteacher was within the protection of the Toleration Act unless he\r\nsubscribed those articles of the Church of England which affirm\r\nthe Athanasian doctrine. It is evident that no honest Unitarian can\r\nsubscribe those articles. The inference is, that the persons who\r\npreached in these chapels down to the year 1779 must have been either\r\nTrinitarians or rogues. Now, Sir, I believe that they were neither\r\nTrinitarians nor rogues; and I cannot help suspecting that the great\r\nprelate who brought this charge against them is not so well read in the\r\nhistory of the nonconformist sects as in the history of that Church of\r\nwhich he is an ornament. The truth is that, long before the year 1779,\r\nthe clause of the Toleration Act which required dissenting ministers\r\nto subscribe thirty-five or thirty-six of our thirty-nine articles\r\nhad almost become obsolete. Indeed, that clause had never been rigidly\r\nenforced. From the very first there were some dissenting ministers who\r\nrefused to subscribe, and yet continued to preach. Calany was one; and\r\nhe was not molested. And if this could be done in the year in which the\r\nToleration Act passed, we may easily believe that, at a later period,\r\nthe law would not have been very strictly observed. New brooms, as\r\nthe vulgar proverb tells us, sweep clean; and no statute is so rigidly\r\nenforced as a statute just made. But, Sir, so long ago as the year 1711,\r\nthe provisions of the Toleration Act on this subject were modified. In\r\nthat year the Whigs, in order to humour Lord Nottingham, with whom\r\nthey had coalesced against Lord Oxford, consented to let the Occasional\r\nConformity Bill pass; but they insisted on inserting in the bill a\r\nclause which was meant to propitiate the dissenters. By this clause\r\nit was enacted that, if an information were laid against a dissenting\r\nminister for having omitted to subscribe the articles, the defendant\r\nmight, by subscribing at any stage of the proceedings anterior to\r\nthe judgment, defeat the information, and throw all the costs on the\r\ninformer. The House will easily believe that, when such was the state of\r\nthe law, informers were not numerous. Indeed, during the discussions of\r\n1773, it was distinctly affirmed, both in Parliament and in manifestoes\r\nput forth by the dissenting body, that the majority of nonconformist\r\nministers then living had never subscribed. All arguments, therefore,\r\ngrounded on the insincerity which has been rashly imputed to the\r\nUnitarians of former generations, fall at once to the ground.\r\n\r\nBut, it is said, the persons who, in the reigns of James the Second, of\r\nWilliam the Third, and of Anne, first established these chapels, held\r\nthe doctrine of the Trinity; and therefore, when, at a later period, the\r\npreachers and congregations departed from the doctrine of the Trinity,\r\nthey ought to have departed from the chapels too. The honourable and\r\nlearned gentleman, the Attorney General, has refuted this argument so\r\nably that he has scarcely left anything for me to say about it. It is\r\nwell-known that the change which, soon after the Revolution, began to\r\ntake place in the opinions of a section of the old Puritan body, was a\r\ngradual, an almost imperceptible change. The principle of the English\r\nPresbyterians was to have no confession of faith and no form of prayer.\r\nTheir trust deeds contained no accurate theological definitions.\r\nNonsubscription was in truth the very bond which held them together.\r\nWhat, then, could be more natural than that, Sunday by Sunday,\r\nthe sermons should have become less and less like those of the old\r\nCalvinistic divines, that the doctrine of the Trinity should have been\r\nless and less frequently mentioned, that at last it should have ceased\r\nto be mentioned, and that thus, in the course of years, preachers and\r\nhearers should, by insensible degrees, have become first Arians, then,\r\nperhaps, Socinians. I know that this explanation has been treated\r\nwith disdain by people profoundly ignorant of the history of English\r\nnonconformity. I see that my right honourable friend near me (Mr Fox\r\nMaule.) does not assent to it. Will he permit me to refer him to an\r\nanalogous case with which he cannot but be well acquainted? No person\r\nin the House is more versed than he in the ecclesiastical history of\r\nScotland; and he will, I am sure, admit that some of the doctrines now\r\nprofessed by the Scotch sects which sprang from the secessions of 1733\r\nand 1760 are such as the seceders of 1733 and the seceders of 1760 would\r\nhave regarded with horror. I have talked with some of the ablest, most\r\nlearned, and most pious of the Scotch dissenters of our time; and they\r\nall fully admitted that they held more than one opinion which their\r\npredecessors would have considered as impious. Take the question of the\r\nconnection between Church and State. The seceders of 1733 thought that\r\nthe connection ought to be much closer than it is. They blamed the\r\nlegislature for tolerating heresy. They maintained that the Solemn\r\nleague and covenant was still binding on the kingdom. They considered\r\nit as a national sin that the validity of the Solemn League and Covenant\r\nwas not recognised at the time of the Revolution. When George Whitfield\r\nwent to Scotland, though they approved of his Calvinistic opinions, and\r\nthough they justly admired that natural eloquence which he possessed in\r\nso wonderful a degree, they would hold no communion with him because he\r\nwould not subscribe the Solemn League and Covenant. Is that the doctrine\r\nof their successors? Are the Scotch dissenters now averse to toleration?\r\nAre they not zealous for the voluntary system? Is it not their constant\r\ncry that it is not the business of the civil magistrate to encourage any\r\nreligion, false or true? Does any Bishop now abhor the Solemn League\r\nand Covenant more than they? Here is an instance in which numerous\r\ncongregations have, retaining their identity, passed gradually from one\r\nopinion to another opinion. And would it be just, would it be decent in\r\nme, to impute dishonesty to them on that account? My right honourable\r\nfriend may be of opinion that the question touching the connection\r\nbetween the Church and State is not a vital question. But was that the\r\nopinion of the divines who drew up the Secession Testimony? He well\r\nknows that in their view a man who denied that it was the duty of the\r\ngovernment to defend religious truth with the civil sword was as much a\r\nheretic as a man who denied the doctrine of the Trinity.\r\n\r\nAgain, Sir, take the case of the Wesleyan Methodists. They are zealous\r\nagainst this bill. They think it monstrous that a chapel originally\r\nbuilt for people holding one set of doctrines should be occupied by\r\npeople holding a different set of doctrines. I would advise them to\r\nconsider whether they cannot find in the history of their own body\r\nreasons for being a little more indulgent. What were the opinions of\r\nthat great and good man, their founder, on the question whether men not\r\nepiscopally ordained could lawfully administer the Eucharist? He told\r\nhis followers that lay administration was a sin which he never could\r\ntolerate. Those were the very words which he used; and I believe that,\r\nduring his lifetime, the Eucharist never was administered by laymen\r\nin any place of worship which was under his control. After his death,\r\nhowever, the feeling in favour of lay administration became strong and\r\ngeneral among his disciples. The Conference yielded to that feeling. The\r\nconsequence is that now, in every chapel which belonged to Wesley, those\r\nwho glory in the name of Wesleyans commit, every Sacrament Sunday, what\r\nWesley declared to be a sin which he would never tolerate. And yet these\r\nvery persons are not ashamed to tell us in loud and angry tones that it\r\nis fraud, downright fraud, in a congregation which has departed from its\r\noriginal doctrines to retain its original endowments. I believe, Sir,\r\nthat, if you refuse to pass this bill, the Courts of Law will soon have\r\nto decide some knotty questions which, as yet, the Methodists little\r\ndream of.\r\n\r\nIt has, I own, given me great pain to observe the unfair and acrimonious\r\nmanner in which too many of the Protestant nonconformists have\r\nopposed this bill. The opposition of the Established Church has been\r\ncomparatively mild and moderate; and yet from the Established Church we\r\nhad less right to expect mildness and moderation. It is certainly\r\nnot right, but it is very natural, that a church, ancient and richly\r\nendowed, closely connected with the Crown and the aristocracy, powerful\r\nin parliament, dominant in the universities, should sometimes forget\r\nwhat is due to poorer and humbler Christian societies. But when I hear\r\na cry for what is nothing less than persecution set up by men who have\r\nbeen, over and over again within my own memory, forced to invoke in\r\ntheir own defence the principles of toleration, I cannot but feel\r\nastonishment mingled with indignation. And what above all excites both\r\nmy astonishment and my indignation is this, that the most noisy among\r\nthe noisy opponents of the bill which we are considering are some\r\nsectaries who are at this very moment calling on us to pass another\r\nbill of just the same kind for their own benefit. I speak of those Irish\r\nPresbyterians who are asking for an ex post facto law to confirm their\r\nmarriages. See how exact the parallel is between the case of those\r\nmarriages and the case of these chapels. The Irish Presbyterians have\r\ngone on marrying according to their own forms during a long course of\r\nyears. The Unitarians have gone on occupying, improving, embellishing\r\ncertain property during a long course of years. In neither case did any\r\ndoubt as to the right arise in the most honest, in the most scrupulous\r\nmind. At length, about the same time, both the validity of the\r\nPresbyterian marriages and the validity of the title by which the\r\nUnitarians held their chapels were disputed. The two questions came\r\nbefore the tribunals. The tribunals, with great reluctance, with great\r\npain, pronounced that, neither in the case of the marriages nor in the\r\ncase of the chapels, can prescription be set up against the letter\r\nof the law. In both cases there is a just claim to relief such as the\r\nlegislature alone can afford. In both the legislature is willing to\r\ngrant that relief. But this will not satisfy the orthodox Presbyterian.\r\nHe demands with equal vehemence two things, that he shall be relieved,\r\nand that nobody else shall be relieved. In the same breath he tells us\r\nthat it would be most iniquitous not to pass a retrospective law for his\r\nbenefit, and that it would be most iniquitous to pass a retrospective\r\nlaw for the benefit of his fellow sufferers. I never was more amused\r\nthan by reading, the other day, a speech made by a person of great note\r\namong the Irish Presbyterians on the subject of these marriages. \"Is it\r\nto be endured,\" he says, \"that the mummies of old and forgotten laws are\r\nto be dug up and unswathed for the annoyance of dissenters?\" And yet a\r\nfew hours later, this eloquent orator is himself hard at work in digging\r\nup and unswathing another set of mummies for the annoyance of another\r\nset of dissenters. I should like to know how he and such as he would\r\nlook if we Churchmen were to assume the same tone towards them which\r\nthey think it becoming to assume towards the Unitarian body; if we were\r\nto say, \"You and those whom you would oppress are alike out of our pale.\r\nIf they are heretics in your opinion, you are schismatics in ours. Since\r\nyou insist on the letter of the law against them, we will insist on the\r\nletter of the law against you. You object to ex post facto statutes; and\r\nyou shall have none. You think it reasonable that men should, in spite\r\nof a prescription of eighty or ninety years, be turned out of a chapel\r\nbuilt with their own money, and a cemetery where their own kindred lie,\r\nbecause the original title was not strictly legal. We think it equally\r\nreasonable that those contracts which you have imagined to be marriages,\r\nbut which are now adjudged not to be legal marriages, should be\r\ntreated as nullities.\" I wish from my soul that some of these orthodox\r\ndissenters would recollect that the doctrine which they defend with so\r\nmuch zeal against the Unitarians is not the whole sum and substance of\r\nChristianity, and that there is a text about doing unto others as you\r\nwould that they should do unto you.\r\n\r\nTo any intelligent man who has no object except to do justice, the\r\nTrinitarian dissenter and the Unitarian dissenter who are now asking us\r\nfor relief will appear to have exactly the same right to it. There\r\nis, however, I must own, one distinction between the two cases. The\r\nTrinitarian dissenters are a strong body, and especially strong among\r\nthe electors of towns. They are of great weight in the State. Some of\r\nus may probably, by voting to-night against their wishes, endanger\r\nour seats in this House. The Unitarians, on the other hand, are few in\r\nnumber. Their creed is unpopular. Their friendship is likely to injure\r\na public man more than their enmity. If therefore there be among us\r\nany person of a nature at once tyrannical and cowardly, any person who\r\ndelights in persecution, but is restrained by fear from persecuting\r\npowerful sects, now is his time. He never can have a better opportunity\r\nof gratifying his malevolence without risk of retribution. But, for my\r\npart, I long ago espoused the cause of religious liberty, not because\r\nthat cause was popular, but because it was just; and I am not disposed\r\nto abandon the principles to which I have been true through my whole\r\nlife in deference to a passing clamour. The day may come, and may come\r\nsoon, when those who are now loudest in raising that clamour may again\r\nbe, as they have formerly been, suppliants for justice. When that day\r\ncomes I will try to prevent others from oppressing them, as I now try\r\nto prevent them from oppressing others. In the meantime I shall\r\ncontend against their intolerance with the same spirit with which I may\r\nhereafter have to contend for their rights.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUGAR DUTIES. (FEBRUARY 26, 1845) A SPEECH DELIVERED IN THE HOUSE OF\r\nCOMMONS ON THE 26TH OF FEBRUARY, 1845.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-sixth of February, 1845, on the question that the order of\r\nthe day for going into Committee of Ways and Means should be read, Lord\r\nJohn Russell moved the following amendment:--\"That it is the opinion\r\nof this House that the plan proposed by Her Majesty's Government,\r\nin reference to the Sugar Duties, professes to keep up a distinction\r\nbetween foreign free labour sugar and foreign slave labour sugar, which\r\nis impracticable and illusory; and, without adequate benefit to the\r\nconsumer, tends so greatly to impair the revenue as to render the\r\nremoval of the Income and Property Tax at the end of three years\r\nextremely uncertain and improbable.\" The amendment was rejected by 236\r\nvotes to 142. In the debate the following Speech was made.\r\n\r\nSir, if the question now at issue were merely a financial or a\r\ncommercial question, I should be unwilling to offer myself to your\r\nnotice: for I am well aware that there are, both on your right and on\r\nyour left hand, many gentlemen far more deeply versed in financial and\r\ncommercial science than myself; and I should think that I discharged\r\nmy duty better by listening to them than by assuming the office of\r\na teacher. But, Sir, the question on which we are at issue with Her\r\nMajesty's Ministers is neither a financial nor a commercial question.\r\nI do not understand it to be disputed that, if we were to pronounce our\r\ndecision with reference merely to fiscal and mercantile considerations,\r\nwe should at once adopt the plan recommended by my noble friend. Indeed\r\nthe right honourable gentleman, the late President of the Board of\r\nTrade (Mr Gladstone.), has distinctly admitted this. He says that\r\nthe Ministers of the Crown call upon us to sacrifice great pecuniary\r\nadvantages and great commercial facilities, for the purpose of\r\nmaintaining a moral principle. Neither in any former debate nor in\r\nthe debate of this night has any person ventured to deny that, both as\r\nrespects the public purse and as respects the interests of trade,\r\nthe course recommended by my noble friend is preferable to the course\r\nrecommended by the Government.\r\n\r\nThe objections to my noble friend's amendment, then, are purely moral\r\nobjections. We lie, it seems, under a moral obligation to make a\r\ndistinction between the produce of free labour and the produce of slave\r\nlabour. Now I should be very unwilling to incur the imputation of being\r\nindifferent to moral obligations. I do, however, think that it is in\r\nmy power to show strong reasons for believing that the moral obligation\r\npleaded by the Ministers has no existence. If there be no such moral\r\nobligation, then, as it is conceded on the other side that all fiscal\r\nand commercial arguments are on the side of my noble friend, it follows\r\nthat we ought to adopt his amendment.\r\n\r\nThe right honourable gentleman, the late President of the Board of\r\nTrade, has said that the Government does not pretend to act with perfect\r\nconsistency as to this distinction between free labour and slave labour.\r\nIt was, indeed, necessary that he should say this; for the policy of the\r\nGovernment is obviously most inconsistent. Perfect consistency, I admit,\r\nwe are not to expect in human affairs. But, surely, there is a decent\r\nconsistency which ought to be observed; and of this the right honourable\r\ngentleman himself seems to be sensible; for he asks how, if we admit\r\nsugar grown by Brazilian slaves, we can with decency continue to stop\r\nBrazilian vessels engaged in the slave trade. This argument, whatever\r\nbe its value, proceeds on the very correct supposition that the test\r\nof sincerity in individuals, in parties, and in governments, is\r\nconsistency. The right honourable gentleman feels, as we must all feel,\r\nthat it is impossible to give credit for good faith to a man who on one\r\noccasion pleads a scruple of conscience as an excuse for not doing a\r\ncertain thing, and who on other occasions, where there is no essential\r\ndifference of circumstances, does that very thing without any scruple\r\nat all. I do not wish to use such a word as hypocrisy, or to impute that\r\nodious vice to any gentleman on either side of the House. But whoever\r\ndeclares one moment that he feels himself bound by a certain moral rule,\r\nand the next moment, in a case strictly similar, acts in direct defiance\r\nof that rule, must submit to have, if not his honesty, yet at least his\r\npower of discriminating right from wrong very gravely questioned.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, I deny the existence of the moral obligation pleaded by the\r\nGovernment. I deny that we are under any moral obligation to turn our\r\nfiscal code into a penal code, for the purpose of correcting vices in\r\nthe institutions of independent states. I say that, if you suppose such\r\na moral obligation to be in force, the supposition leads to consequences\r\nfrom which every one of us would recoil, to consequences which would\r\nthrow the whole commercial and political system of the world into\r\nconfusion. I say that, if such a moral obligation exists, our financial\r\nlegislation is one mass of injustice and inhumanity. And I say more\r\nespecially that, if such a moral obligation exists, the right honourable\r\nBaronet's Budget is one mass of injustice and inhumanity.\r\n\r\nObserve, I am not disputing the paramount authority of moral\r\nobligation. I am not setting up pecuniary considerations against\r\nmoral considerations. I know that it would be not only a wicked but\r\na shortsighted policy, to aim at making a nation like this great and\r\nprosperous by violating the laws of justice. To those laws, enjoin what\r\nthey may, I am prepared to submit. But I will not palter with them: I\r\nwill not cite them to-day in order to serve one turn, and quibble them\r\naway to-morrow in order to serve another. I will not have two standards\r\nof right; one to be applied when I wish to protect a favourite interest\r\nat the public cost; and another to be applied when I wish to replenish\r\nthe Exchequer, and to give an impulse to trade. I will not have two\r\nweights or two measures. I will not blow hot and cold, play fast and\r\nloose, strain at a gnat and swallow a camel. Can the Government say as\r\nmuch? Are gentlemen opposite prepared to act in conformity with their\r\nown principle? They need not look long for opportunities. The Statute\r\nBook swarms with enactments directly opposed to the rule which they\r\nprofess to respect. I will take a single instance from our existing\r\nlaws, and propound it to the gentlemen opposite as a test, if I must not\r\nsay of their sincerity, yet of their power of moral discrimination. Take\r\nthe article of tobacco. Not only do you admit the tobacco of the United\r\nStates which is grown by slaves; not only do you admit the tobacco of\r\nCuba which is grown by slaves, and by slaves, as you tell us, recently\r\nimported from Africa; but you actually interdict the free labourer\r\nof the United Kingdom from growing tobacco. You have long had in your\r\nStatute Book laws prohibiting the cultivation of tobacco in England, and\r\nauthorising the Government to destroy all tobacco plantations except a\r\nfew square yards, which are suffered to exist unmolested in botanical\r\ngardens, for purposes of science. These laws did not extend to Ireland.\r\nThe free peasantry of Ireland began to grow tobacco. The cultivation\r\nspread fast. Down came your legislation upon it; and now, if the Irish\r\nfreeman dares to engage in competition with the slaves of Virginia and\r\nHavannah, you exchequer him; you ruin him; you grub up his plantation.\r\nHere, then, we have a test by which we may try the consistency of the\r\ngentlemen opposite. I ask you, are you prepared, I do not say to exclude\r\nthe slave grown tobacco, but to take away from slave grown tobacco the\r\nmonopoly which you now give to it, and to permit the free labourer of\r\nthe United Kingdom to enter into competition on equal terms, on any\r\nterms, with the negro who works under the lash? I am confident that\r\nthe three right honourable gentleman opposite, the First Lord of the\r\nTreasury, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the late President of\r\nthe Board of Trade, will all with one voice answer \"No.\" And why not?\r\n\"Because,\" say they, \"it will injure the revenue. True it is,\" they will\r\nsay, \"that the tobacco imported from abroad is grown by slaves, and by\r\nslaves many of whom have been recently carried across the Atlantic in\r\ndefiance, not only of justice and humanity, but of law and treaty. True\r\nit is that the cultivators of the United Kingdom are freemen. But then\r\non the imported tobacco we are able to raise at the Custom House a duty\r\nof six hundred per cent., sometimes indeed of twelve hundred per cent.:\r\nand, if tobacco were grown here, it would be difficult to get an excise\r\nduty of even a hundred per cent. We cannot submit to this loss of\r\nrevenue; and therefore we must give a monopoly to the slaveholder, and\r\nmake it penal in the freeman to evade that monopoly.\" You may be\r\nright; but, in the name of common sense, be consistent. If this moral\r\nobligation of which you talk so much be one which may with propriety\r\nyield to fiscal considerations, let us have Brazilian sugars. If it be\r\nparamount to all fiscal considerations, let us at least have British\r\nsnuff and cigars.\r\n\r\nThe present Ministers may indeed plead that they are not the authors of\r\nthe laws which prohibit the cultivation of tobacco in Great Britain\r\nand Ireland. That is true. The present Government found those laws in\r\nexistence: and no doubt there is good sense in the Conservative doctrine\r\nthat many things which ought not to have been set up ought not, when\r\nthey have been set up, to be hastily and rudely pulled down. But what\r\nwill the right honourable Baronet urge in vindication of his own new\r\nbudget? He is not content with maintaining laws which he finds already\r\nexisting in favour of produce grown by slaves. He introduces a crowd\r\nof new laws to the same effect. He comes down to the House with a\r\nproposition for entirely taking away the duties on the importation of\r\nraw cotton. He glories in this scheme. He tells us that it is in strict\r\naccordance with the soundest principles of legislation. He tells us that\r\nit will be a blessing to the country. I agree with him, and I intend\r\nto vote with him. But how is all this cotton grown? Is it not grown by\r\nslaves? Again I say, you may be right; but, in the name of common\r\nsense, be consistent. I saw, with no small amusement, a few days ago, a\r\nparagraph by one of the right honourable Baronet's eulogists, which was\r\nto the following effect:--\"Thus has this eminent statesman given to the\r\nEnglish labourer a large supply of a most important raw material, and\r\nhas manfully withstood those ravenous Whigs who wished to inundate our\r\ncountry with sugar dyed in negro blood.\" With what I should like to\r\nknow, is the right honourable Baronet's cotton dyed?\r\n\r\nFormerly, indeed, an attempt was made to distinguish between the\r\ncultivation of cotton and the cultivation of sugar. The cultivation of\r\nsugar, it was said, was peculiarly fatal to the health and life of\r\nthe slave. But that plea, whatever it may have been worth, must now be\r\nabandoned; for the right honourable Baronet now proposes to reduce, to\r\na very great extent, the duty on slave grown sugar imported from the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThen a new distinction is set up. The United States, it is said, have\r\nslavery; but they have no slave trade. I deny that assertion. I say that\r\nthe sugar and cotton of the United States are the fruits, not only of\r\nslavery, but of the slave trade. And I say further that, if there be on\r\nthe surface of this earth a country which, before God and man, is more\r\naccountable than any other for the misery and degradation of the\r\nAfrican race, that country is not Brazil, the produce of which the right\r\nhonourable Baronet excludes, but the United States, the produce of\r\nwhich he proposes to admit on more favourable terms than ever. I have\r\nno pleasure in going into an argument of this nature. I do not conceive\r\nthat it is the duty of a member of the English Parliament to discuss\r\nabuses which exist in other societies. Such discussion seldom tends to\r\nproduce any reform of such abuses, and has a direct tendency to wound\r\nnational pride, and to inflame national animosities. I would willingly\r\navoid this subject; but the right honourable Baronet leaves me no\r\nchoice. He turns this House into a Court of Judicature for the purpose\r\nof criticising and comparing the institutions of independent States. He\r\ntells us that our Tariff is to be made an instrument for rewarding the\r\njustice and humanity of some Foreign Governments, and for punishing\r\nthe barbarity of others. He binds up the dearest interests of my\r\nconstituents with questions with which otherwise I should, as a Member\r\nof Parliament, have nothing to do. I would gladly keep silence on such\r\nquestions. But it cannot be. The tradesmen and the professional men\r\nwhom I represent say to me, \"Why are we to be loaded, certainly for some\r\nyears, probably for ever, with a tax, admitted by those who impose it to\r\nbe grievous, unequal, inquisitorial? Why are we to be loaded in time of\r\npeace with burdens heretofore reserved for the exigencies of war?\" The\r\npaper manufacturer, the soap manufacturer, say, \"Why, if the Income Tax\r\nis to be continued, are our important and suffering branches of industry\r\nto have no relief?\" And the answer is, \"Because Brazil does not behave\r\nso well as the United States towards the negro race.\" Can I then avoid\r\ninstituting a comparison? Am I not bound to bring to the test the truth\r\nof an assertion pregnant with consequences so momentous to those who\r\nhave sent me hither? I must speak out; and, if what I say gives offence\r\nand produces inconvenience, for that offence and for that inconvenience\r\nthe Government is responsible.\r\n\r\nI affirm, then, that there exists in the United States a slave trade,\r\nnot less odious or demoralising, nay, I do in my conscience believe,\r\nmore odious and more demoralising than that which is carried on between\r\nAfrica and Brazil. North Carolina and Virginia are to Louisiana and\r\nAlabama what Congo is to Rio Janeiro. The slave States of the Union are\r\ndivided into two classes, the breeding States, where the human beasts of\r\nburden increase and multiply and become strong for labour, and the sugar\r\nand cotton States to which those beasts of burden are sent to be worked\r\nto death. To what an extent the traffic in man is carried on we may\r\nlearn by comparing the census of 1830 with the census of 1840. North\r\nCarolina and Virginia are, as I have said, great breeding States. During\r\nthe ten years from 1830 to 1840 the slave population of North Carolina\r\nwas almost stationary. The slave population of Virginia positively\r\ndecreased. Yet, both in North Carolina and Virginia propagation was,\r\nduring those ten years, going on fast. The number of births among the\r\nslaves in those States exceeded by hundreds of thousands the number of\r\nthe deaths. What then became of the surplus? Look to the returns from\r\nthe Southern States, from the States whose produce the right honourable\r\nBaronet proposes to admit with reduced duty or with no duty at all; and\r\nyou will see. You will find that the increase in the breeding States\r\nwas barely sufficient to meet the demand of the consuming States. In\r\nLouisiana, for example, where we know that the negro population is\r\nworn down by cruel toil, and would not, if left to itself, keep up its\r\nnumbers, there were, in 1830, one hundred and seven thousand slaves; in\r\n1840, one hundred and seventy thousand. In Alabama, the slave population\r\nduring those ten years much more than doubled; it rose from one hundred\r\nand seventeen thousand to two hundred and fifty-three thousand. In\r\nMississippi it actually tripled. It rose from sixty-five thousand to one\r\nhundred and ninety-five thousand. So much for the extent of this slave\r\ntrade. And as to its nature, ask any Englishman who has ever travelled\r\nin the Southern States. Jobbers go about from plantation to plantation\r\nlooking out for proprietors who are not easy in their circumstances,\r\nand who are likely to sell cheap. A black boy is picked up here; a black\r\ngirl there. The dearest ties of nature and of marriage are torn asunder\r\nas rudely as they were ever torn asunder by any slave captain on the\r\ncoast of Guinea. A gang of three or four hundred negroes is made up;\r\nand then these wretches, handcuffed, fettered, guarded by armed men,\r\nare driven southward, as you would drive,--or rather as you would not\r\ndrive,--a herd of oxen to Smithfield, that they may undergo the deadly\r\nlabour of the sugar mill near the mouth of the Mississippi. A very\r\nfew years of that labour in that climate suffice to send the stoutest\r\nAfrican to his grave. But he can well be spared. While he is fast\r\nsinking into premature old age, negro boys in Virginia are growing up as\r\nfast into vigorous manhood to supply the void which cruelty is making in\r\nLouisiana. God forbid that I should extenuate the horrors of the slave\r\ntrade in any form! But I do think this its worst form. Bad enough is it\r\nthat civilised men should sail to an uncivilised quarter of the world\r\nwhere slavery exists, should there buy wretched barbarians, and should\r\ncarry them away to labour in a distant land: bad enough! But that a\r\ncivilised man, a baptized man, a man proud of being a citizen of a free\r\nstate, a man frequenting a Christian church, should breed slaves for\r\nexportation, and, if the whole horrible truth must be told, should even\r\nbeget slaves for exportation, should see children, sometimes his own\r\nchildren, gambolling around him from infancy, should watch their growth,\r\nshould become familiar with their faces, and should then sell them for\r\nfour or five hundred dollars a head, and send them to lead in a remote\r\ncountry a life which is a lingering death, a life about which the best\r\nthing that can be said is that it is sure to be short; this does, I own,\r\nexcite a horror exceeding even the horror excited by that slave trade\r\nwhich is the curse of the African coast. And mark: I am not speaking of\r\nany rare case, of any instance of eccentric depravity. I am speaking of\r\na trade as regular as the trade in pigs between Dublin and Liverpool, or\r\nas the trade in coals between the Tyne and the Thames.\r\n\r\nThere is another point to which I must advert. I have no wish to\r\napologise for slavery as it exists in Brazil; but this I say, that\r\nslavery, as it exists in Brazil, though a fearful evil, seems to me a\r\nmuch less hopeless evil than slavery as it exists in the United States.\r\nIn estimating the character of negro slavery we must never forget one\r\nmost important ingredient; an ingredient which was wanting to slavery as\r\nit was known to the Greeks and Romans; an ingredient which was wanting\r\nto slavery as it appeared in Europe during the middle ages; I mean the\r\nantipathy of colour. Where this antipathy exists in a high degree, it is\r\ndifficult to conceive how the white masters and the black labourers can\r\never be mingled together, as the lords and villeins in many parts of\r\nthe Old World have been, in one free community. Now this antipathy is\r\nnotoriously much stronger in the United States than in the Brazils.\r\nIn the Brazils the free people of colour are numerous. They are not\r\nexcluded from honourable callings. You may find among them merchants,\r\nphysicians, lawyers: many of them bear arms; some have been admitted to\r\nholy orders. Whoever knows what dignity, what sanctity, the Church\r\nof Rome ascribes to the person of a priest, will at once perceive the\r\nimportant consequences which follow from this last circumstance. It\r\nis by no means unusual to see a white penitent kneeling before the\r\nspiritual tribunal of a negro, confessing his sins to a negro, receiving\r\nabsolution from a negro. It is by no means unusual to see a negro\r\ndispensing the Eucharist to a circle of whites. I need not tell the\r\nHouse what emotions of amazement and of rage such a spectacle would\r\nexcite in Georgia or South Carolina. Fully admitting, therefore, as I\r\ndo, that Brazilian slavery is a horrible evil, I yet must say that, if\r\nI were called upon to declare whether I think the chances of the African\r\nrace on the whole better in Brazil or in the United States, I should at\r\nonce answer that they are better in Brazil. I think it not improbable\r\nthat in eighty or a hundred years the black population of Brazil may\r\nbe free and happy. I see no reasonable prospect of such a change in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe right honourable gentleman, the late President of the Board of\r\nTrade, has said much about that system of maritime police by which we\r\nhave attempted to sweep slave trading vessels from the great highway of\r\nnations. Now what has been the conduct of Brazil, and what has been the\r\nconduct of the United States, as respects that system of police? Brazil\r\nhas come into the system; the United States have thrown every impediment\r\nin the way of the system. What opinion Her Majesty's Ministers entertain\r\nrespecting the Right of Search we know from a letter of my Lord Aberdeen\r\nwhich has, within a few days, been laid on our table. I believe that I\r\nstate correctly the sense of that letter when I say that the noble Earl\r\nregards the Right of Search as an efficacious means, and as the only\r\nefficacious means, of preventing the maritime slave trade. He expresses\r\nmost serious doubts whether any substitute can be devised. I think that\r\nthis check would be a most valuable one, if all nations would submit\r\nto it; and I applaud the humanity which has induced successive British\r\nadministrations to exert themselves for the purpose of obtaining the\r\nconcurrence of foreign Powers in so excellent a plan. Brazil consented\r\nto admit the Right of Search; the United States refused, and by refusing\r\ndeprived the Right of Search of half its value. Not content with\r\nrefusing to admit the Right of Search, they even disputed the right of\r\nvisit, a right which no impartial publicist in Europe will deny to be\r\nin strict conformity with the Law of Nations. Nor was this all. In every\r\npart of the Continent of Europe the diplomatic agents of the Cabinet of\r\nWashington have toiled to induce other nations to imitate the example of\r\nthe United States. You cannot have forgotten General Cass's letter. You\r\ncannot have forgotten the terms in which his Government communicated to\r\nhim its approbation of his conduct. You know as well as I do that, if\r\nthe United States had submitted to the Right of Search, there would have\r\nbeen no outcry against that right in France. Nor do I much blame the\r\nFrench. It is but natural that, when one maritime Power makes it a point\r\nof honour to refuse us this right, other maritime Powers should think\r\nthat they cannot, without degradation, take a different course. It is\r\nbut natural that a Frenchman, proud of his country, should ask why the\r\ntricolor is to be less respected then the stars and stripes. The right\r\nhonourable gentleman says that, if we assent to my noble friend's\r\namendment, we shall no longer be able to maintain the Right of Search.\r\nSir, he need not trouble himself about that right. It is already gone.\r\nWe have agreed to negotiate on the subject with France. Everybody knows\r\nhow that negotiation will end. The French flag will be exempted from\r\nsearch: Spain will instantly demand, if she has not already demanded,\r\nsimilar exemption; and you may as well let her have it with a good\r\ngrace, and without wrangling. For a Right of Search, from which the\r\nflags of France and America are exempted, is not worth a dispute.\r\nThe only system, therefore, which, in the opinion of Her Majesty's\r\nMinisters, has yet been found efficacious for the prevention of the\r\nmaritime slave trade, is in fact abandoned. And who is answerable for\r\nthis? The United States of America. The chief guilt even of the slave\r\ntrade between Africa and Brazil lies, not with the Government of Brazil,\r\nbut with that of the United States. And yet the right honourable Baronet\r\nproposes to punish Brazil for the slave trade, and in the same breath\r\nproposes to show favour to the United States, because the United States\r\nare pure from the crime of slave trading. I thank the right honourable\r\ngentleman, the late President of the Board of Trade, for reminding me of\r\nMr Calhoun's letter. I could not have wished for a better illustration\r\nof my argument. Let anybody who has read that letter say what is the\r\ncountry which, if we take on ourselves to avenge the wrongs of Africa,\r\nought to be the first object of our indignation. The Government of the\r\nUnited States has placed itself on a bad eminence to which Brazil never\r\naspired, and which Brazil, even if aspiring to it, never could attain.\r\nThe Government of the United States has formally declared itself the\r\npatron, the champion of negro slavery all over the world, the evil\r\ngenius, the Arimanes of the African race, and seems to take pride in\r\nthis shameful and odious distinction. I well understand that an American\r\nstatesman may say, \"Slavery is a horrible evil; but we were born to it,\r\nwe see no way at present to rid ourselves of it: and we must endure it\r\nas we best may.\" Good and enlightened men may hold such language;\r\nbut such is not the language of the American Cabinet. That Cabinet is\r\nactuated by a propagandist spirit, and labours to spread servitude and\r\nbarbarism with an ardour such as no other Government ever showed in\r\nthe cause of freedom and civilisation. Nay more; the doctrine held at\r\nWashington is that this holy cause sanctifies the most unholy means.\r\nThese zealots of slavery think themselves justified in snatching away\r\nprovinces on the right hand and on the left, in defiance of public\r\nfaith and international law, from neighbouring countries which have\r\nfree institutions, and this avowedly for the purpose of diffusing over\r\na wider space the greatest curse that afflicts humanity. They put\r\nthemselves at the head of the slavedriving interest throughout the\r\nworld, just as Elizabeth put herself at the head of the Protestant\r\ninterest; and wherever their favourite institution is in danger, are\r\nready to stand by it as Elizabeth stood by the Dutch. This, then, I hold\r\nto be demonstrated, that of all societies now existing, the Republic of\r\nthe United States is by far the most culpable as respects slavery and\r\nthe slave trade.\r\n\r\nNow then I come to the right honourable Baronet's Budget. He tells us,\r\nthat he will not admit Brazilian sugar, because the Brazilian Government\r\ntolerates slavery and connives at the slave trade; and he tells us at\r\nthe same time, that he will admit the slave grown cotton and the slave\r\ngrown sugar of the United States. I am utterly at a loss to understand\r\nhow he can vindicate his consistency. He tells us that if we adopt my\r\nnoble friend's proposition, we shall give a stimulus to the slave trade\r\nbetween Africa and Brazil. Be it so. But is it not equally clear that,\r\nif we adopt the right honourable Baronet's own propositions, we shall\r\ngive a stimulus to the slave trade between Virginia and Louisiana? I\r\nhave not the least doubt that, as soon as the contents of his Budget\r\nare known on the other side of the Atlantic, the slave trade will become\r\nmore active than it is at this moment; that the jobbers in human flesh\r\nand blood will be more busy than ever; that the droves of manacled\r\nnegroes, moving southward to their doom, will be more numerous on\r\nevery road. These will be the fruits of the right honourable Baronet's\r\nmeasure. Yet he tells us that this part of his Budget is framed on sound\r\nprinciples and will greatly benefit the country; and he tells us truth.\r\nI mean to vote with him; and I can perfectly, on my own principles,\r\nreconcile to my conscience the vote which I shall give. How the right\r\nhonourable Baronet can reconcile the course which he takes to his\r\nconscience, I am at a loss to conceive, and am not a little curious to\r\nknow. No man is more capable than he of doing justice to any cause which\r\nhe undertakes; and it would be most presumptuous in me to anticipate the\r\ndefence which he means to set up. But I hope that the House will suffer\r\nme, as one who feels deeply on this subject, now to explain the\r\nreasons which convince me that I ought to vote for the right honourable\r\nBaronet's propositions respecting the produce of the United States. In\r\nexplaining those reasons, I at the same time explain the reasons which\r\ninduce me to vote with my noble friend to-night.\r\n\r\nI say then, Sir, that I fully admit the paramount authority of moral\r\nobligations. But it is important that we should accurately understand\r\nthe nature and extent of those obligations. We are clearly bound\r\nto wrong no man. Nay, more, we are bound to regard all men with\r\nbenevolence. But to every individual, and to every society, Providence\r\nhas assigned a sphere within which benevolence ought to be peculiarly\r\nactive; and if an individual or a society neglects what lies within that\r\nsphere in order to attend to what lies without, the result is likely to\r\nbe harm and not good.\r\n\r\nIt is thus in private life. We should not be justified in injuring a\r\nstranger in order to benefit ourselves or those who are dearest to us.\r\nEvery stranger is entitled, by the laws of humanity, to claim from us\r\ncertain reasonable good offices. But it is not true that we are bound\r\nto exert ourselves to serve a mere stranger as we are bound to exert\r\nourselves to serve our own relations. A man would not be justified in\r\nsubjecting his wife and children to disagreeable privations, in order to\r\nsave even from utter ruin some foreigner whom he never saw. And if a\r\nman were so absurd and perverse as to starve his own family in order\r\nto relieve people with whom he had no acquaintance, there can be\r\nlittle doubt that his crazy charity would produce much more misery than\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nIt is the same with nations. No statesmen ought to injure other\r\ncountries in order to benefit his own country. No statesman ought to\r\nlose any fair opportunity of rendering to foreign nations such good\r\noffices as he can render without a breach of the duty which he owes to\r\nthe society of which he is a member. But, after all, our country is our\r\ncountry, and has the first claim on our attention. There is nothing, I\r\nconceive, of narrow-mindedness in this patriotism. I do not say that we\r\nought to prefer the happiness of one particular society to the happiness\r\nof mankind; but I say that, by exerting ourselves to promote the\r\nhappiness of the society with which we are most nearly connected, and\r\nwith which we are best acquainted, we shall do more to promote the\r\nhappiness of mankind than by busying ourselves about matters which we do\r\nnot fully understand, and cannot efficiently control.\r\n\r\nThere are great evils connected with the factory system in this country.\r\nSome of those evils might, I am inclined to think, be removed or\r\nmitigated by legislation. On that point many of my friends differ\r\nfrom me; but we all agree in thinking that it is the duty of a British\r\nLegislator to consider the subject attentively, and with a serious sense\r\nof responsibility. There are also great social evils in Russia. The\r\npeasants of that empire are in a state of servitude. The sovereign of\r\nRussia is bound by the most solemn obligations to consider whether he\r\ncan do anything to improve the condition of that large portion of his\r\nsubjects. If we watch over our factory children, and he watches over\r\nhis peasants, much good may be done. But would any good be done if\r\nthe Emperor of Russia and the British Parliament were to interchange\r\nfunctions; if he were to take under his patronage the weavers of\r\nLancashire, if we were to take under our patronage the peasants of the\r\nVolga; if he were to say, \"You shall send no cotton to Russia till you\r\npass a ten Hours' Bill;\" if we were to say, \"You shall send no hemp or\r\ntallow to England till you emancipate your serfs?\"\r\n\r\nOn these principles, Sir, which seem to me to be the principles of plain\r\ncommon sense, I can, without resorting to any casuistical subtilties,\r\nvindicate to my own conscience, and, I hope, to my country, the whole\r\ncourse which I have pursued with respect to slavery. When I first came\r\ninto Parliament, slavery still existed in the British dominions. I had,\r\nas it was natural that I should have, a strong feeling on the subject.\r\nI exerted myself, according to my station and to the measure of my\r\nabilities, on the side of the oppressed. I shrank from no personal\r\nsacrifice in that cause. I do not mention this as matter of boast. It\r\nwas no more than my duty. The right honourable gentleman, the Secretary\r\nof State for the Home Department, knows that, in 1833, I disapproved\r\nof one part of the measure which Lord Grey's Government proposed on the\r\nsubject of slavery. I was in office; and office was then as important\r\nto me as it could be to any man. I put my resignation into the hands of\r\nLord Spencer, and both spoke and voted against the Administration. To my\r\nsurprise, Lord Grey and Lord Spencer refused to accept my resignation,\r\nand I remained in office; but during some days I considered myself as\r\nout of the service of the Crown. I at the same time heartily joined in\r\nlaying a heavy burden on the country for the purpose of compensating the\r\nplanters. I acted thus, because, being a British Legislator, I thought\r\nmyself bound, at any cost to myself and to my constituents, to remove a\r\nfoul stain from the British laws, and to redress the wrongs endured by\r\npersons who, as British subjects, were placed under my guardianship. But\r\nmy especial obligations in respect of negro slavery ceased when slavery\r\nitself ceased in that part of the world for the welfare of which I, as\r\na member of this House, was accountable. As for the blacks in the United\r\nStates, I feel for them, God knows. But I am not their keeper. I do not\r\nstand in the same relation to the slaves of Louisiana and Alabama in\r\nwhich I formerly stood to the slaves of Demerara and Jamaica. I am\r\nbound, on the other hand, by the most solemn obligations, to promote the\r\ninterests of millions of my own countrymen, who are indeed by no means\r\nin a state so miserable and degraded as that of the slaves in the United\r\nStates, but who are toiling hard from sunrise to sunset in order to\r\nobtain a scanty subsistence; who are often scarcely able to procure the\r\nnecessaries of life; and whose lot would be alleviated if I could open\r\nnew markets to them, and free them from taxes which now press heavily\r\non their industry. I see clearly that, by excluding the produce of slave\r\nlabour from our ports, I should inflict great evil on my fellow-subjects\r\nand constituents. But the good which, by taking such a course, I should\r\ndo to the negroes in the United States seems to me very problematical.\r\nThat by admitting slave grown cotton and slave grown sugar we do, in\r\nsome sense, encourage slavery and the Slave Trade, may be true. But\r\nI doubt whether, by turning our fiscal code into a penal code for\r\nrestraining the cruelty of the American planters, we should not, on\r\nthe whole, injure the negroes rather than benefit them. No independent\r\nnation will endure to be told by another nation, \"We are more virtuous\r\nthan you; we have sate in judgment on your institutions; we find them\r\nto be bad; and, as a punishment for your offences, we condemn you to pay\r\nhigher duties at our Custom House than we demand from the rest of the\r\nworld.\" Such language naturally excites the resentment of foreigners.\r\nI can make allowance for their susceptibility. For I myself sympathise\r\nwith them, I know that Ireland has been misgoverned; and I have done,\r\nand purpose to do, my best to redress her grievances. But when I take up\r\na New York journal, and read there the rants of President Tyler's son, I\r\nfeel so much disgusted by such insolent absurdity that I am for a moment\r\ninclined to deny that Ireland has any reason whatever to complain. It\r\nseems to me that if ever slavery is peaceably extinguished in the United\r\nStates, that great and happy change must be brought about by the efforts\r\nof those enlightened and respectable American citizens who hate slavery\r\nas much as we hate it. Now I cannot help fearing that, if the British\r\nParliament were to proclaim itself the protector and avenger of the\r\nAmerican slave, the pride of those excellent persons would take the\r\nalarm. It might become a point of national honour with them to stand by\r\nan institution which they have hitherto regarded as a national disgrace.\r\nWe should thus confer no benefit on the negro; and we should at the same\r\ntime inflict cruel suffering on our own countrymen.\r\n\r\nOn these grounds, Sir, I can, with a clear conscience, vote for the\r\nright honourable Baronet's propositions respecting the cotton and sugar\r\nof the United States. But on exactly the same grounds I can, with a\r\nclear conscience, vote for the amendment of my noble friend. And I\r\nconfess that I shall be much surprised if the right honourable Baronet\r\nshall be able to point out any distinction between the cases.\r\n\r\nI have detained you too long, Sir; yet there is one point to which I\r\nmust refer; I mean the refining. Was such a distinction ever heard of?\r\nIs there anything like it in all Pascal's Dialogues with the old Jesuit?\r\nNot for the world are we to eat one ounce of Brazilian sugar. But we\r\nimport the accursed thing; we bond it; we employ our skill and machinery\r\nto render it more alluring to the eye and to the palate; we export it\r\nto Leghorn and Hamburg; we send it to all the coffee houses of Italy\r\nand Germany: we pocket a profit on all this; and then we put on a\r\nPharisaical air, and thank God that we are not like those wicked\r\nItalians and Germans who have no scruple about swallowing slave grown\r\nsugar. Surely this sophistry is worthy only of the worst class of false\r\nwitnesses. \"I perjure myself! Not for the world. I only kissed my thumb;\r\nI did not put my lips to the calf-skin.\" I remember something very like\r\nthe right honourable Baronet's morality in a Spanish novel which I\r\nread long ago. I beg pardon of the House for detaining them with such a\r\ntrifle; but the story is much to the purpose. A wandering lad, a sort\r\nof Gil Blas, is taken into the service of a rich old silversmith, a most\r\npious man, who is always telling his beads, who hears mass daily,\r\nand observes the feasts and fasts of the church with the utmost\r\nscrupulosity. The silversmith is always preaching honesty and piety.\r\n\"Never,\" he constantly repeats to his young assistant, \"never touch what\r\nis not your own; never take liberties with sacred things.\" Sacrilege, as\r\nuniting theft with profaneness, is the sin of which he has the deepest\r\nhorror. One day, while he is lecturing after his usual fashion, an\r\nill-looking fellow comes into the shop with a sack under his arm. \"Will\r\nyou buy these?\" says the visitor, and produces from the sack some church\r\nplate and a rich silver crucifix. \"Buy them!\" cries the pious man. \"No,\r\nnor touch them; not for the world. I know where you got them. Wretch\r\nthat you are, have you no care for your soul?\" \"Well then,\" says the\r\nthief, \"if you will not buy them, will you melt them down for me?\" \"Melt\r\nthem down!\" answers the silver smith, \"that is quite another matter.\"\r\nHe takes the chalices and the crucifix with a pair of tongs; the silver,\r\nthus in bond, is dropped into the crucible, melted, and delivered to the\r\nthief, who lays down five pistoles and decamps with his booty. The\r\nyoung servant stares at this strange scene. But the master very\r\ngravely resumes his lecture. \"My son,\" he says, \"take warning by that\r\nsacrilegious knave, and take example by me. Think what a load of guilt\r\nlies on his conscience. You will see him hanged before long. But as to\r\nme, you saw that I would not touch the stolen property. I keep these\r\ntongs for such occasions. And thus I thrive in the fear of God, and\r\nmanage to turn an honest penny.\" You talk of morality. What can be more\r\nimmoral than to bring ridicule on the very name of morality, by drawing\r\ndistinctions where there are no differences? Is it not enough that this\r\ndishonest casuistry has already poisoned our theology? Is it not enough\r\nthat a set of quibbles has been devised, under cover of which a divine\r\nmay hold the worst doctrines of the Church of Rome, and may hold with\r\nthem the best benefice of the Church of England? Let us at least keep\r\nthe debates of this House free from the sophistry of Tract Number\r\nNinety.\r\n\r\nAnd then the right honourable gentleman, the late President of the Board\r\nof Trade, wonders that other nations consider our abhorrence of slavery\r\nand the Slave Trade as sheer hypocrisy. Why, Sir, how should it be\r\notherwise? And, if the imputation annoys us, whom have we to thank for\r\nit? Numerous and malevolent as our detractors are, none of them was ever\r\nso absurd as to charge us with hypocrisy because we took slave grown\r\ntobacco and slave grown cotton, till the Government began to affect\r\nscruples about admitting slave grown sugar. Of course, as soon as our\r\nMinisters ostentatiously announced to all the world that our fiscal\r\nsystem was framed on a new and sublime moral principle, everybody\r\nbegan to inquire whether we consistently adhered to that principle. It\r\nrequired much less acuteness and much less malevolence than that of our\r\nneighbours to discover that this hatred of slave grown produce was mere\r\ngrimace. They see that we not only take tobacco produced by means of\r\nslavery and of the Slave Trade, but that we positively interdict freemen\r\nin this country from growing tobacco. They see that we not only take\r\ncotton produced by means of slavery and of the Slave Trade, but that we\r\nare about to exempt this cotton from all duty. They see that we are at\r\nthis moment reducing the duty on the slave grown sugar of Louisiana.\r\nHow can we expect them to believe that it is from a sense of justice and\r\nhumanity that we lay a prohibitory duty on the sugar of Brazil? I care\r\nlittle for the abuse which any foreign press or any foreign tribune may\r\nthrow on the Machiavelian policy of perfidious Albion. What gives me\r\npain is, not that the charge of hypocrisy is made, but that I am unable\r\nto see how it is to be refuted.\r\n\r\nYet one word more. The right honourable gentleman, the late President\r\nof the Board of Trade, has quoted the opinions of two persons, highly\r\ndistinguished by the exertions which they made for the abolition of\r\nslavery, my lamented friend, Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, and Sir Stephen\r\nLushington. It is most true that those eminent persons did approve of\r\nthe principle laid down by the right honourable Baronet opposite in\r\n1841. I think that they were in error; but in their error I am sure\r\nthat they were sincere, and I firmly believe that they would have been\r\nconsistent. They would have objected, no doubt, to my noble friend's\r\namendment; but they would have objected equally to the right honourable\r\nBaronet's budget. It was not prudent, I think, in gentlemen opposite\r\nto allude to those respectable names. The mention of those names\r\nirresistibly carries the mind back to the days of the great struggle for\r\nnegro freedom. And it is but natural that we should ask where, during\r\nthat struggle, were those who now profess such loathing for slave grown\r\nsugar? The three persons who are chiefly responsible for the financial\r\nand commercial policy of the present Government I take to be the right\r\nhonourable Baronet at the head of the Treasury, the right honourable\r\ngentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the right honourable\r\ngentleman the late President of the Board of Trade. Is there anything\r\nin the past conduct of any one of the three which can lead me to believe\r\nthat his sensibility to the evils of slavery is greater than mine? I am\r\nsure that the right honourable Baronet the first Lord of the Treasury\r\nwould think that I was speaking ironically if I were to compliment him\r\non his zeal for the liberty of the negro race. Never once, during the\r\nwhole of the long and obstinate conflict which ended in the abolition of\r\nslavery in our colonies, did he give one word, one sign of encouragement\r\nto those who suffered and laboured for the good cause. The whole weight\r\nof his great abilities and influence was in the other scale. I well\r\nremember that, so late as 1833, he declared in this House that he could\r\ngive his assent neither to the plan of immediate emancipation proposed\r\nby my noble friend who now represents Sunderland (Lord Howick.), nor to\r\nthe plan of gradual emancipation proposed by Lord Grey's government.\r\nI well remember that he said, \"I shall claim no credit hereafter on\r\naccount of this bill; all that I desire is to be absolved from the\r\nresponsibility.\" As to the other two right honourable gentlemen whom\r\nI have mentioned, they are West Indians; and their conduct was that\r\nof West Indians. I do not wish to give them pain, or to throw any\r\ndisgraceful imputation on them. Personally I regard them with feelings\r\nof goodwill and respect. I do not question their sincerity; but I know\r\nthat the most honest men are but too prone to deceive themselves into\r\nthe belief that the path towards which they are impelled by their own\r\ninterests and passions is the path of duty. I am conscious that this\r\nmight be my own case; and I believe it to be theirs. As the right\r\nhonourable gentleman, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, has left the\r\nHouse, I will only say that, with respect to the question of slavery,\r\nhe acted after the fashion of the class to which he belonged. But as the\r\nright honourable gentleman, the late President of the Board of Trade,\r\nis in his place, he must allow me to bring to his recollection the part\r\nwhich he took in the debates of 1833. He then said, \"You raise a great\r\nclamour about the cultivation of sugar. You say that it is a species of\r\nindustry fatal to the health and life of the slave. I do not deny that\r\nthere is some difference between the labour of a sugar plantation and\r\nthe labour of a cotton plantation, or a coffee plantation. But the\r\ndifference is not so great as you think. In marshy soils, the slaves who\r\ncultivate the sugar cane suffer severely. But in Barbadoes, where the\r\nair is good, they thrive and multiply.\" He proceeded to say that, even\r\nat the worst, the labour of a sugar plantation was not more unhealthy\r\nthan some kinds of labour in which the manufacturers of England are\r\nemployed, and which nobody thinks of prohibiting. He particularly\r\nmentioned grinding. \"See how grinding destroys the health, the sight,\r\nthe life. Yet there is no outcry against grinding.\" He went on to say\r\nthat the whole question ought to be left by Parliament to the West\r\nIndian Legislature. [Mr Gladstone: \"Really I never said so. You are not\r\nquoting me at all correctly.\"] What, not about the sugar cultivation and\r\nthe grinding? [Mr Gladstone: \"That is correct; but I never recommended\r\nthat the question should be left to the West Indian Legislatures.\"] I\r\nhave quoted correctly. But since my right honourable friend disclaims\r\nthe sentiment imputed to him by the reporters, I shall say no more about\r\nit. I have no doubt that he is quite right, and that what he said was\r\nmisunderstood. What is undisputed is amply sufficient for my purpose.\r\nI see that the persons who now show so much zeal against slavery in\r\nforeign countries, are the same persons who formerly countenanced\r\nslavery in the British Colonies. I remember a time when they maintained\r\nthat we were bound in justice to protect slave grown sugar against the\r\ncompetition of free grown sugar, and even of British free grown sugar.\r\nI now hear them calling on us to protect free grown sugar against the\r\ncompetition of slave grown sugar. I remember a time when they extenuated\r\nas much as they could the evils of the sugar cultivation. I now hear\r\nthem exaggerating those evils. But, devious as their course has been,\r\nthere is one clue by which I can easily track them through the whole\r\nmaze. Inconstant in everything else, they are constant in demanding\r\nprotection for the West Indian planter. While he employs slaves, they\r\ndo their best to apologise for the evils of slavery. As soon as he is\r\nforced to employ freemen, they begin to cry up the blessings of freedom.\r\nThey go round the whole compass, and yet to one point they steadfastly\r\nadhere: and that point is the interest of the West Indian proprietors.\r\nI have done, Sir; and I thank the House most sincerely for the patience\r\nand indulgence with which I have been heard. I hope that I have at\r\nleast vindicated my own consistency. How Her Majesty's Ministers will\r\nvindicate their consistency, how they will show that their conduct has\r\nat all times been guided by the same principles, or even that their\r\nconduct at the present time is guided by any fixed principle at all, I\r\nam unable to conjecture.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYNOOTH. (APRIL 14, 1845) A SPEECH DELIVERED IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS ON\r\nTHE 14TH OF APRIL, 1845.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday the eleventh of April, 1845, Sir Robert Peel moved the\r\nsecond reading of the Maynooth College Bill. After a debate of six\r\nnights the motion was carried by 323 votes to 176. On the second night\r\nthe following Speech was made.\r\n\r\nI do not mean, Sir, to follow the honourable gentleman who has just sate\r\ndown into a discussion on an amendment which is not now before us. When\r\nmy honourable friend the Member for Sheffield shall think it expedient\r\nto make a motion on that important subject to which he has repeatedly\r\ncalled the attention of the House, I may, perhaps, ask to be heard.\r\nAt present I shall content myself with explaining the reasons which\r\nconvince me that it is my duty to vote for the second reading of this\r\nbill; and I cannot, I think, better explain those reasons than by\r\npassing in review, as rapidly as I can, the chief objections which have\r\nbeen made to the bill here and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe objectors, Sir, may be divided into three classes. The first class\r\nconsists of those persons who object, not to the principle of the grant\r\nto Maynooth College, but merely to the amount. The second class consists\r\nof persons who object on principle to all grants made to a church which\r\nthey regard as corrupt. The third class consists of persons who object\r\non principle to all grants made to churches, whether corrupt or pure.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, of those three classes the first is evidently that which\r\ntakes the most untenable ground. How any person can think that Maynooth\r\nCollege ought to be supported by public money, and yet can think\r\nthis bill too bad to be suffered to go into Committee, I do not well\r\nunderstand. I am forced however to believe that there are many such\r\npersons. For I cannot but remember that the old annual vote attracted\r\nscarcely any notice; and I see that this bill has produced violent\r\nexcitement. I cannot but remember that the old annual vote used to pass\r\nwith very few dissentients; and I see that great numbers of gentlemen,\r\nwho never were among those dissentients, have crowded down to the House\r\nin order to divide against this bill. It is indeed certain that a large\r\nproportion, I believe a majority, of those members who cannot, as\r\nthey assure us, conscientiously support the plan proposed by the right\r\nhonourable Baronet at the head of the Government, would without the\r\nsmallest scruple have supported him if he had in this, as in former\r\nyears, asked us to give nine thousand pounds for twelve months. So it\r\nis: yet I cannot help wondering that it should be so. For how can\r\nany human ingenuity turn a question between nine thousand pounds and\r\ntwenty-six thousand pounds, or between twelve months and an indefinite\r\nnumber of months, into a question of principle? Observe: I am not now\r\nanswering those who maintain that nothing ought to be given out of\r\nthe public purse to a corrupt church; nor am I now answering those who\r\nmaintain that nothing ought to be given out of the public purse to\r\nany church whatever. They, I admit, oppose this bill on principle. I\r\nperfectly understand, though I do not myself hold, the opinion of the\r\nzealous voluntary who says, \"Whether the Roman Catholic Church teaches\r\ntruth or error, she ought to have no assistance from the State.\" I also\r\nperfectly understand, though I do not myself hold, the opinion of the\r\nzealous Protestant who says, \"The Roman Catholic Church teaches error,\r\nand therefore ought to have no assistance from the State.\" But I cannot\r\nunderstand the reasoning of the man who says, \"In spite of the errors\r\nof the Roman Catholic Church, I think that she ought to have some\r\nassistance from the State; but I am bound to mark my abhorrence of her\r\nerrors by doling out to her a miserable pittance. Her tenets are so\r\nabsurd and noxious that I will pay the professor who teaches them wages\r\nless than I should offer to my groom. Her rites are so superstitious\r\nthat I will take care that they shall be performed in a chapel with a\r\nleaky roof and a dirty floor. By all means let us keep her a college,\r\nprovided only that it be a shabby one. Let us support those who are\r\nintended to teach her doctrines and to administer her sacraments to the\r\nnext generation, provided only that every future priest shall cost us\r\nless than a foot soldier. Let us board her young theologians; but let\r\ntheir larder be so scantily supplied that they may be compelled to break\r\nup before the regular vacation from mere want of food. Let us lodge\r\nthem; but let their lodging be one in which they may be packed like pigs\r\nin a stye, and be punished for their heterodoxy by feeling the snow and\r\nthe wind through the broken panes.\" Is it possible to conceive anything\r\nmore absurd or more disgraceful? Can anything be clearer than this, that\r\nwhatever it is lawful to do it is lawful to do well? If it be right that\r\nwe should keep up this college at all, it must be right that we should\r\nkeep it up respectably. Our national dignity is concerned. For this\r\ninstitution, whether good or bad, is, beyond all dispute, a very\r\nimportant institution. Its office is to form the character of those who\r\nare to form the character of millions. Whether we ought to extend any\r\npatronage to such an institution is a question about which wise and\r\nhonest men may differ. But that, as we do extend our patronage to such\r\nan institution, our patronage ought to be worthy of the object, and\r\nworthy of the greatness of our country, is a proposition from which I am\r\nastonished to hear any person dissent.\r\n\r\nIt is, I must say, with a peculiarly bad grace that one of the members\r\nfor the University to which I have the honour to belong (The Honourable\r\nCharles Law, Member for the University of Cambridge.), a gentleman who\r\nnever thought himself bound to say a word or to give a vote against\r\nthe grant of nine thousand pounds, now vehemently opposes the grant\r\nof twenty-six thousand pounds as exorbitant. When I consider how\r\nmunificently the colleges of Cambridge and Oxford are endowed, and with\r\nwhat pomp religion and learning are there surrounded; when I call to\r\nmind the long streets of palaces, the towers and oriels, the venerable\r\ncloisters, the trim gardens, the organs, the altar pieces, the solemn\r\nlight of the stained windows, the libraries, the museums, the galleries\r\nof painting and sculpture; when I call to mind also the physical\r\ncomforts which are provided both for instructors and for pupils; when I\r\nreflect that the very sizars and servitors are far better lodged and fed\r\nthan those students who are to be, a few years hence, the priests and\r\nbishops of the Irish people; when I think of the spacious and stately\r\nmansions of the heads of houses, of the commodious chambers of the\r\nfellows and scholars, of the refectories, the combination rooms, the\r\nbowling greens, the stabling, of the state and luxury of the great feast\r\ndays, of the piles of old plate on the tables, of the savoury steam of\r\nthe kitchens, of the multitudes of geese and capons which turn at once\r\non the spits, of the oceans of excellent ale in the butteries; and when\r\nI remember from whom all this splendour and plenty is derived; when I\r\nremember what was the faith of Edward the Third and of Henry the Sixth,\r\nof Margaret of Anjou and Margaret of Richmond, of William of Wykeham and\r\nWilliam of Waynefleet, of Archbishop Chicheley and Cardinal Wolsey; when\r\nI remember what we have taken from the Roman Catholics, King's College,\r\nNew College, Christ Church, my own Trinity; and when I look at the\r\nmiserable Dotheboys Hall which we have given them in exchange, I feel,\r\nI must own, less proud than I could wish of being a Protestant and a\r\nCambridge man.\r\n\r\nSome gentlemen, it is true, have made an attempt to show that there is\r\na distinction of principle between the old grant which they have always\r\nsupported and the larger grant which they are determined to oppose. But\r\nnever was attempt more unsuccessful. They say that, at the time of the\r\nUnion, we entered into an implied contract with Ireland to keep up this\r\ncollege. We are therefore, they argue, bound by public faith to continue\r\nthe old grant; but we are not bound to make any addition to that grant.\r\nNow, Sir, on this point, though on no other, I do most cordially agree\r\nwith those petitioners who have, on this occasion, covered your\r\ntable with such huge bales of spoiled paper and parchment. I deny the\r\nexistence of any such contract. I think myself perfectly free to vote\r\nfor the abolition of this college, if I am satisfied that it is a\r\npernicious institution; as free as I am to vote against any item of\r\nthe ordnance estimates; as free as I am to vote for a reduction of the\r\nnumber of marines. It is strange, too, that those who appeal to this\r\nimaginary contract should not perceive that, even if their fiction be\r\nadmitted as true, it will by no means get them out of their difficulty.\r\nTell us plainly what are the precise terms of the contract which you\r\nsuppose Great Britain to have made with Ireland about this college.\r\nWhatever the terms be, they will not serve your purpose. Was the\r\ncontract this, that the Imperial Parliament would do for the college\r\nwhat the Irish Parliament had been used to do? Or was the contract this,\r\nthat the Imperial Parliament would keep the college in a respectable and\r\nefficient state? If the former was the contract, nine thousand pounds\r\nwould be too much. If the latter was the contract, you will not, I\r\nam confident, be able to prove that twenty-six thousand pounds is too\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\nI have now, I think, said quite as much as need be said in answer to\r\nthose who maintain that we ought to give support to this college, but\r\nthat the support ought to be niggardly and precarious. I now come to\r\nanother and a much more formidable class of objectors. Their objections\r\nmay be simply stated thus. No man can justifiably, either as\r\nan individual or as a trustee for the public, contribute to the\r\ndissemination of religious error. But the church of Rome teaches\r\nreligious error. Therefore we cannot justifiably contribute to the\r\nsupport of an institution of which the object is the dissemination of\r\nthe doctrines of the Church of Rome. Now, Sir, I deny the major of this\r\nsyllogism. I think that there are occasions on which we are bound to\r\ncontribute to the dissemination of doctrines with which errors are\r\ninseparably intermingled. Let me be clearly understood. The question is\r\nnot whether we should teach truth or teach error, but whether we should\r\nteach truth adulterated with error, or teach no truth at all. The\r\nconstitution of the human mind is such that it is impossible to provide\r\nany machinery for the dissemination of truth which shall not, with the\r\ntruth, disseminate some error. Even those rays which come down to us\r\nfrom the great source of light, pure as they are in themselves, no\r\nsooner enter that gross and dark atmosphere in which we dwell than the\r\nthey are so much refracted, discoloured, and obscured, that they too\r\noften lead us astray. It will be generally admitted that, if religious\r\ntruth can be anywhere found untainted by error, it is in the Scriptures.\r\nYet is there actually on the face of the globe a single copy of the\r\nScriptures of which it can be said that it contains truth absolutely\r\nuntainted with error? Is there any manuscript, any edition of the Old or\r\nNew Testament in the original tongues, which any scholar will pronounce\r\nfaultless? But to the vast majority of Christians the original tongues\r\nare and always must be unintelligible. With the exception of perhaps one\r\nman in ten thousand, we must be content with translations. And is there\r\nany translation in which there are not numerous mistakes? Are there not\r\nnumerous mistakes even in our own authorised version, executed as that\r\nversion was with painful diligence and care, by very able men, and under\r\nvery splendid patronage? Of course mistakes must be still more numerous\r\nin those translations which pious men have lately made into Bengalee,\r\nHindostanee, Tamul, Canarese, and other Oriental tongues. I admire the\r\nzeal, the industry, the energy of those who, in spite of difficulties\r\nwhich to ordinary minds would seem insurmountable, accomplished that\r\narduous work. I applaud those benevolent societies which munificently\r\nencouraged that work. But I have been assured by good judges that the\r\ntranslations have many faults. And how should it have been otherwise?\r\nHow should an Englishman produce a faultless translation from the Hebrew\r\ninto the Cingalese? I say, therefore, that even the Scriptures, in every\r\nform in which men actually possess them, contain a certain portion of\r\nerror. And, if this be so, how can you look for pure undefecated truth\r\nin any other composition? You contribute, without any scruple, to the\r\nprinting of religious tracts, to the establishing of Sunday Schools, to\r\nthe sending forth of missionaries. But are your tracts perfect? Are your\r\nschoolmasters infallible? Are your missionaries inspired? Look at the\r\ntwo churches which are established in this island. Will you say that\r\nthey both teach truth without any mixture of error? That is impossible.\r\nFor they teach different doctrines on more than one important subject.\r\nIt is plain therefore, that if, as you tell us, it be a sin in a state\r\nto patronise an institution which teaches religious error, either the\r\nChurch of England or the Church of Scotland ought to be abolished.\r\nBut will anybody even venture to affirm that either of those churches\r\nteaches truth without any mixture of error? Have there not long been in\r\nthe Church of Scotland two very different schools of theology? During\r\nmany years, Dr Robertson, the head of the moderate party, and Dr\r\nErskine, the head of the Calvinistic party, preached under the same\r\nroof, one in the morning, the other in the evening. They preached\r\ntwo different religions, so different that the followers of Robertson\r\nthought the followers of Erskine fanatics, and the followers of Erskine\r\nthought the followers of Robertson Arians or worse. And is there no\r\nmixture of error in the doctrine taught by the clergy of the Church of\r\nEngland? Is not the whole country at this moment convulsed by disputes\r\nas to what the doctrine of the Church on some important subjects really\r\nis? I shall not take on myself to say who is right and who is wrong.\r\nBut this I say with confidence, that, whether the Tractarians or the\r\nEvangelicals be in the right, many hundreds of those divines who every\r\nSunday occupy the pulpits of our parish churches must be very much in\r\nthe wrong.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, I see that many highly respectable persons, who think it a sin\r\nto contribute to the teaching of error at Maynooth College, think it not\r\nmerely lawful, but a sacred duty, to contribute to the teaching of error\r\nin the other cases which I have mentioned. They know that our version of\r\nthe Bible contains some error. Yet they subscribe to the Bible Society.\r\nThey know that the Serampore translations contain a still greater\r\nquantity of error. Yet they give largely towards the printing and\r\ncirculating of those translations. My honourable friend the Member for\r\nthe University of Oxford will not deny that there is among the clergy of\r\nthe Church of England a Puritan party, and also an Anti-puritan\r\nparty, and that one of these parties must teach some error. Yet he is\r\nconstantly urging us to grant to this Church an additional endowment of\r\nI know not how many hundreds of thousands of pounds. He would doubtless\r\ndefend himself by saying that nothing on earth is perfect; that the\r\npurest religious society must consist of human beings, and must have\r\nthose defects which arise from human infirmities; and that the truths\r\nheld by the established clergy, though not altogether unalloyed with\r\nerror, are so precious, that it is better that they should be imparted\r\nto the people with the alloy than that they should not be imparted at\r\nall. Just so say I. I am sorry that we cannot teach pure truth to the\r\nIrish people. But I think it better that they should have important and\r\nsalutary truth, polluted by some error, than that they should remain\r\naltogether uninstructed. I heartily wish that they were Protestants. But\r\nI had rather that they should be Roman Catholics than that they should\r\nhave no religion at all. Would you, says one gentleman, teach the people\r\nto worship Jugernaut or Kalee? Certainly not. My argument leads to\r\nno such conclusion. The worship of Jugernaut and Kalee is a curse to\r\nmankind. It is much better that people should be without any religion\r\nthan that they should believe in a religion which enjoins prostitution,\r\nsuicide, robbery, assassination. But will any Protestant deny that it\r\nis better that the Irish should be Roman Catholics than that they should\r\nlive and die like the beasts of the field, indulge their appetites\r\nwithout any religious restraint, suffer want and calamity without any\r\nreligious consolation, and go to their graves without any religious\r\nhope? These considerations entirely satisfy my mind. Of course I would\r\nnot propagate error for its own sake. To do so would be not merely\r\nwicked, but diabolical. But, in order that I may be able to propagate\r\ntruth, I consent to propagate that portion of error which adheres to\r\ntruth, and which cannot be separated from truth. I wish Christianity to\r\nhave a great influence on the peasantry of Ireland. I see no probability\r\nthat Christianity will have that influence except in one form. That form\r\nI consider as very corrupt. Nevertheless, the good seems to me greatly\r\nto predominate over the evil; and therefore, being unable to get the\r\ngood alone, I am content to take the good and the evil together.\r\n\r\nI now come to the third class of our opponents. I mean those who take\r\ntheir stand on the voluntary principle. I will not, on this occasion,\r\ninquire whether they are right in thinking that governments ought not to\r\ncontribute to the support of any religion, true or false. For it seems\r\nto me that, even if I were to admit that the general rule is correctly\r\nlaid down by them, the present case would be an exception to that rule.\r\nThe question on which I am about to vote is not whether the State shall\r\nor shall not give any support to religion in Ireland. The State does\r\ngive such support, and will continue to give such support, whatever may\r\nbe the issue of this debate. The only point which we have now to decide\r\nis whether, while such support is given, it shall be given exclusively\r\nto the religion of the minority. Here is an island with a population of\r\nnear eight millions, and with a wealthy established church, the members\r\nof which are little more than eight hundred thousand. There is an\r\narchbishop with ten thousand a year. If I recollect rightly, seventy\r\nthousand pounds are divided among twelve prelates. At the same time the\r\nProtestant dissenters in the north of Ireland receive, in another form,\r\nsupport from the State. But the great majority of the population, the\r\npoorest part of the population, the part of the population which is most\r\nin need of assistance, the part of the population which holds that faith\r\nfor the propagation of which the tithes were originally set apart, and\r\nthe church lands originally given, is left to maintain its own priests.\r\nNow is not this a case which stands quite by itself? And may not even\r\nthose who hold the general proposition, that every man ought to pay\r\nhis own spiritual pastor, yet vote, without any inconsistency, for this\r\nbill? I was astonished to hear the honourable Member for Shrewsbury (Mr\r\nDisraeli.) tell us that, if we make this grant, it will be impossible\r\nfor us to resist the claims of any dissenting sect. He particularly\r\nmentioned the Wesleyan Methodists. Are the cases analogous? Is there the\r\nslightest resemblance between them? Let the honourable gentleman show\r\nme that of the sixteen millions of people who inhabit England thirteen\r\nmillions are Wesleyan Methodists. Let him show me that the members of\r\nthe Established Church in England are only one tenth of the population.\r\nLet him show me that English dissenters who are not Wesleyan Methodists\r\nreceive a Regium Donum. Let him show me that immense estates bequeathed\r\nto John Wesley for the propagation of Methodism have, by Act of\r\nParliament, been taken from the Methodists and given to the Church.\r\nIf he can show me this, I promise him that, whenever the Wesleyan\r\nMethodists shall ask for twenty-six thousand pounds a year to educate\r\ntheir ministers, I shall be prepared to grant their request. But neither\r\nthe case of the Methodists nor any other case which can be mentioned,\r\nresembles the case with which we have to do. Look round Europe, round\r\nthe world, for a parallel; and you will look in vain. Indeed the state\r\nof things which exists in Ireland never could have existed had not\r\nIreland been closely connected with a country, which possessed a great\r\nsuperiority of power, and which abused that superiority. The burden\r\nwhich we are now, I hope, about to lay on ourselves is but a small\r\npenalty for a great injustice. Were I a staunch voluntary, I should\r\nstill feel that, while the church of eight hundred thousand people\r\nretains its great endowments, I should not be justified in refusing this\r\nsmall boon to the church of eight millions.\r\n\r\nTo sum up shortly what I have said; it is clear to me in the first place\r\nthat, if we have no religious scruple about granting to this College\r\nnine thousand pounds for one year, we ought to have no religious scruple\r\nabout granting twenty-six thousand pounds a year for an indefinite term.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it seems to me that those persons who tell us that we ought\r\nnever in any circumstances to contribute to the propagation of error do\r\nin fact lay down a rule which would altogether interdict the propagation\r\nof truth.\r\n\r\nThirdly, it seems to me that, even on the hypothesis that the voluntary\r\nprinciple is the sound principle, the present case is an excepted case,\r\nto which it would be unjust and unwise to apply that principle.\r\n\r\nSo much, Sir, as to this bill; and now let me add a few words about\r\nthose by whom it has been framed and introduced. We were exhorted,\r\non the first night of this debate, to vote against the bill, without\r\ninquiring into its merits, on the ground that, good or bad, it was\r\nproposed by men who could not honestly and honourably propose it. A\r\nsimilar appeal has been made to us this evening. In these circumstances,\r\nSir, I must, not I hope from party spirit, not, I am sure, from personal\r\nanimosity, but from a regard for the public interest, which must be\r\ninjuriously affected by everything which tends to lower the character\r\nof public men, say plainly what I think of the conduct of Her Majesty's\r\nMinisters. Undoubtedly it is of the highest importance that we should\r\nlegislate well. But it is also of the highest importance that those who\r\ngovern us should have, and should be known to have, fixed principles,\r\nand should be guided by those principles both in office and in\r\nopposition. It is of the highest importance that the world should not be\r\nunder the impression that a statesman is a person who, when he is out,\r\nwill profess and promise anything in order to get in, and who, when he\r\nis in, will forget all that he professed and promised when he was out.\r\nI need not, I suppose, waste time in proving that a law may be in itself\r\nan exceedingly good law, and yet that it may be a law which, when viewed\r\nin connection with the former conduct of those who proposed it, may\r\nprove them to be undeserving of the confidence of their country. When\r\nthis is the case, our course is clear. We ought to distinguish between\r\nthe law and its authors. The law we ought, on account of its intrinsic\r\nmerits, to support. Of the authors of the law, it may be our duty to\r\nspeak in terms of censure.\r\n\r\nIn such terms I feel it to be my duty to speak of Her Majesty's\r\npresent advisers. I have no personal hostility to any of them; and that\r\npolitical hostility which I do not disavow has never prevented me from\r\ndoing justice to their abilities and virtues. I have always admitted,\r\nand I now most willingly admit, that the right honourable Baronet at the\r\nhead of the Government possesses many of the qualities of an excellent\r\nminister, eminent talents for debate, eminent talents for business,\r\ngreat experience, great information, great skill in the management of\r\nthis House. I will go further, and say that I give him full credit for\r\na sincere desire to promote the welfare of his country. Nevertheless,\r\nit is impossible for me to deny that there is too much ground for the\r\nreproaches of those who, having, in spite of a bitter experience, a\r\nsecond time trusted him, now find themselves a second time deluded.\r\nI cannot but see that it has been too much his practice, when in\r\nopposition, to make use of passions with which he has not the slightest\r\nsympathy, and of prejudices which he regards with profound contempt. As\r\nsoon as he is in power a change takes place. The instruments which have\r\ndone his work are flung aside. The ladder by which he has climbed is\r\nkicked down. I am forced to say that the right honourable Baronet acts\r\nthus habitually and on system. The instance before us is not a solitary\r\ninstance. I do not wish to dwell on the events which took place\r\nseventeen or eighteen years ago, on the language which the right\r\nhonourable Baronet held about the Catholic question when he was out of\r\npower in 1827, and on the change which twelve months of power produced.\r\nI will only say that one such change was quite enough for one life.\r\nAgain the right honourable Baronet was in opposition; and again he\r\nemployed his old tactics. I will not minutely relate the history of the\r\nmanoeuvres by which the Whig Government was overthrown. It is enough\r\nto say that many powerful interests were united against that Government\r\nunder the leading of the right honourable Baronet, and that of\r\nthose interests there is not one which is not now disappointed and\r\ncomplaining. To confine my remarks to the subject immediately before\r\nus--can any man deny that, of all the many cries which were raised\r\nagainst the late administration, that which most strongly stirred the\r\npublic mind was the cry of No Popery? Is there a single gentleman in the\r\nHouse who doubts that, if, four years ago, my noble friend the Member\r\nfor the City of London had proposed this bill, he would have been\r\nwithstood by every member of the present Cabinet? Four years ago, Sir,\r\nwe were discussing a very different bill. The party which was then in\r\nopposition, and which is now in place, was attempting to force through\r\nParliament a law, which bore indeed a specious name, but of which the\r\neffect would have been to disfranchise the Roman Catholic electors of\r\nIreland by tens of thousands. It was in vain that we argued, that we\r\nprotested, that we asked for the delay of a single session, for delay\r\ntill an inquiry could be made, for delay till a Committee should report.\r\nWe were told that the case was one of extreme urgency, that every hour\r\nwas precious, that the House must, without loss of time, be purged of\r\nthe minions of Popery. These arts succeeded. A change of administration\r\ntook place. The right honourable Baronet came into power. He has now\r\nbeen near four years in power. He has had a Parliament which would,\r\nbeyond all doubt, have passed eagerly and gladly that Registration\r\nBill which he and his colleagues had pretended that they thought\r\nindispensable to the welfare of the State. And where is that bill now?\r\nFlung away; condemned by its own authors; pronounced by them to be so\r\noppressive, so inconsistent with all the principles of representative\r\ngovernment, that, though they had vehemently supported it when they\r\nwere on your left hand, they could not think of proposing it from the\r\nTreasury Bench. And what substitute does the honourable Baronet give his\r\nfollowers to console them for the loss of their favourite Registration\r\nBill? Even this bill for the endowment of Maynooth College. Was such a\r\nfeat of legerdemain ever seen? And can we wonder that the eager, honest,\r\nhotheaded Protestants, who raised you to power in the confident hope\r\nthat you would curtail the privileges of the Roman Catholics, should\r\nstare and grumble when you propose to give public money to the Roman\r\nCatholics? Can we wonder that, from one end of the country to the other,\r\neverything should be ferment and uproar, that petitions should, night\r\nafter night, whiten all our benches like a snowstorm? Can we wonder that\r\nthe people out of doors should be exasperated by seeing the very men\r\nwho, when we were in office, voted against the old grant to Maynooth,\r\nnow pushed and pulled into the House by your whippers-in to vote for\r\nan increased grant? The natural consequences follow. All those fierce\r\nspirits, whom you hallooed on to harass us, now turn round and begin to\r\nworry you. The Orangeman raises his war-whoop: Exeter Hall sets up its\r\nbray: Mr Macneile shudders to see more costly cheer than ever provided\r\nfor the priests of Baal at the table of the Queen; and the Protestant\r\noperatives of Dublin call for impeachments in exceedingly bad English.\r\nBut what did you expect? Did you think, when, to serve your turn, you\r\ncalled the Devil up, that it was as easy to lay him as to raise him?\r\nDid you think, when you went on, session after session, thwarting and\r\nreviling those whom you knew to be in the right, and flattering all the\r\nworst passions of those whom you knew to be in the wrong, that the day\r\nof reckoning would never come? It has come. There you sit, doing penance\r\nfor the disingenuousness of years. If it be not so, stand up manfully\r\nand clear your fame before the House and the country. Show us that some\r\nsteady principle has guided your conduct with respect to Irish affairs.\r\nShow us how, if you are honest in 1845, you can have been honest in\r\n1841. Explain to us why, after having goaded Ireland to madness for the\r\npurpose of ingratiating yourselves with the English, you are now setting\r\nEngland on fire for the purpose of ingratiating yourselves with the\r\nIrish. Give us some reason which shall prove that the policy which you\r\nare following, as Ministers, is entitled to support, and which shall\r\nnot equally prove you to have been the most factious and unprincipled\r\nopposition that ever this country saw.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, am I, because I think thus of the conduct of Her Majesty's\r\nMinisters, to take the counsel of the honourable member for Shrewsbury\r\nand to vote against their bill? Not so. I know well that the fate of\r\nthis bill and the fate of the administration are in our hands. But\r\nfar be it from us to imitate the arts by which we were overthrown. The\r\nspectacle exhibited on the bench opposite will do quite mischief enough.\r\nThat mischief will not be lessened, but doubled, if there should be an\r\nanswering display of inconsistency on this side of the House. If this\r\nbill, having been introduced by Tories, shall be rejected by Whigs, both\r\nthe great parties in the State will be alike discredited. There will\r\nbe one vast shipwreck of all the public character in the country.\r\nTherefore, making up my mind to sacrifices which are not unattended with\r\npain, and repressing some feelings which stir strongly within me, I have\r\ndetermined to give my strenuous support to this bill. Yes, Sir, to this\r\nbill, and to every bill which shall seem to me likely to promote\r\nthe real Union of Great Britain and Ireland, I will give my support,\r\nregardless of obloquy, regardless of the risk which I may run of losing\r\nmy seat in Parliament. For such obloquy I have learned to consider as\r\ntrue glory; and as to my seat I am determined that it never shall be\r\nheld by an ignominious tenure; and I am sure that it can never be lost\r\nin a more honourable cause.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHURCH OF IRELAND. (APRIL 23, 1845.) A SPEECH DELIVERED IN THE HOUSE\r\nOF COMMONS ON THE 23RD OF APRIL 1845.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-third of April 1845, the order of the day for going into\r\nCommittee on the Maynooth College Bill was read. On the motion that the\r\nSpeaker should leave the chair, Mr Ward, Member for Sheffield, proposed\r\nthe following amendment:--\r\n\r\n\"That it is the opinion of this House that any provision to be made\r\nfor the purposes of the present Bill ought to be taken from the funds\r\nalready applicable to ecclesiastical purposes in Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a debate of two nights the amendment was rejected by 322 votes to\r\n148. On the first night the following Speech was made.\r\n\r\nI was desirous, Sir, to catch your eye this evening, because it happens\r\nthat I have never yet found an opportunity of fully explaining my views\r\non the important subject of the Irish Church. Indeed, I was not in this\r\ncountry when that subject for a time threw every other into the\r\nshade, disturbed the whole political world, produced a schism in the\r\nAdministration of Lord Grey, and overthrew the short Administration of\r\nthe right honourable Baronet opposite. The motion now before us opens,\r\nI conceive, the whole question. My honourable friend the Member for\r\nSheffield, indeed, asks us only to transfer twenty-six thousand pounds a\r\nyear from the Established Church of Ireland to the College of Maynooth.\r\nBut this motion, I think, resembles an action of ejectment brought for\r\na single farm, with the view of trying the title to a large estate.\r\nWhoever refuses to assent to what is now proposed must be considered as\r\nholding the opinion that the property of the Irish Church ought to be\r\nheld inviolate: and I can scarcely think that any person will vote for\r\nwhat is now proposed, who is not prepared to go very much farther. The\r\npoint at issue, I take, therefore, to be this; whether the Irish Church,\r\nas now constituted, shall be maintained or not?\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, when a legislator is called up to decide whether an\r\ninstitution shall be maintained or not, it seems to me that he ought in\r\nthe first place to examine whether it be a good or a bad institution.\r\nThis may sound like a truism; but if I am to judge by the speeches\r\nwhich, on this and former occasions, have been made by gentlemen\r\nopposite, it is no truism, but an exceedingly recondite truth. I, Sir,\r\nthink the Established Church of Ireland a bad institution. I will go\r\nfarther. I am not speaking in anger, or with any wish to excite anger in\r\nothers; I am not speaking with rhetorical exaggeration: I am calmly and\r\ndeliberately expressing, in the only appropriate terms, an opinion which\r\nI formed many years ago, which all my observations and reflections have\r\nconfirmed, and which I am prepared to support by reasons, when I say\r\nthat, of all the institutions now existing in the civilised world, the\r\nEstablished Church of Ireland seems to me the most absurd.\r\n\r\nI cannot help thinking that the speeches of those who defend this Church\r\nsuffice of themselves to prove that my views are just. For who ever\r\nheard anybody defend it on its merits? Has any gentleman to-night\r\ndefended it on its merits? We are told of the Roman Catholic oath; as\r\nif that oath, whatever be its meaning, whatever be the extent of the\r\nobligation which it lays on the consciences of those who take it, could\r\npossibly prove this Church to be a good thing. We are told that Roman\r\nCatholics of note, both laymen and divines, fifty years ago, declared\r\nthat, if they were relieved from the disabilities under which they then\r\nlay, they should willingly see the Church of Ireland in possession of\r\nall its endowments: as if anything that anybody said fifty years ago\r\ncould absolve us from the plain duty of doing what is now best for the\r\ncountry. We are told of the Fifth Article of Union; as if the Fifth\r\nArticle of Union were more sacred than the Fourth. Surely, if there be\r\nany article of the Union which ought to be regarded as inviolable, it is\r\nthe Fourth, which settles the number of members whom Great Britain and\r\nIreland respectively are to send to Parliament. Yet the provisions of\r\nthe Fourth Article have been altered with the almost unanimous assent of\r\nall parties in the State. The change was proposed by the noble lord\r\nwho is now Secretary for the Colonies. It was supported by the right\r\nhonourable Baronet the Secretary for the Home Department, and by other\r\nmembers of the present Administration. And so far were the opponents of\r\nthe Reform Bill from objecting to this infraction of the Treaty of Union\r\nthat they were disposed to go still farther. I well remember the night\r\non which we debated the question, whether Members should be given to\r\nFinsbury, Marylebone, Lambeth, and the Tower Hamlets. On that occasion,\r\nthe Tories attempted to seduce the Irish Reformers from us by promising\r\nthat Ireland should have a share of the plunder of the metropolitan\r\ndistricts. After this, Sir, I must think it childish in gentlemen\r\nopposite to appeal to the Fifth Article of the Union. With still greater\r\nsurprise, did I hear the right honourable gentleman the Secretary for\r\nIreland say that, if we adopt this amendment, we shall make all landed\r\nand funded property insecure. I am really ashamed to answer such an\r\nargument. Nobody proposes to touch any vested interest; and surely\r\nit cannot be necessary for me to point out to the right honourable\r\ngentleman the distinction between property in which some person has a\r\nvested interest, and property in which no person has a vested interest.\r\nThat distinction is part of the very rudiments of political science.\r\nThen the right honourable gentleman quarrels with the form of the\r\namendment. Why, Sir, perhaps a more convenient form might have been\r\nadopted. But is it by cavils like these that a great institution should\r\nbe defended? And who ever heard the Established Church of Ireland\r\ndefended except by cavils like these? Who ever heard any of her\r\nadvocates speak a manly and statesmanlike language? Who ever heard any\r\nof her advocates say, \"I defend this institution because it is a good\r\ninstitution: the ends for which an Established Church exists are such\r\nand such: and I will show you that this Church attains those ends?\"\r\nNobody says this. Nobody has the hardihood to say it. What divine,\r\nwhat political speculator who has written in defence of ecclesiastical\r\nestablishments, ever defended such establishments on grounds which will\r\nsupport the Church of Ireland? What panegyric has ever been pronounced\r\non the Churches of England and Scotland, which is not a satire on the\r\nChurch of Ireland? What traveller comes among us who is not moved to\r\nwonder and derision by the Church of Ireland? What foreign writer on\r\nBritish affairs, whether European or American, whether Protestant or\r\nCatholic, whether Conservative or Liberal, whether partial to England or\r\nprejudiced against England, ever mentions the Church of Ireland without\r\nexpressing his amazement that such an establishment should exist among\r\nreasonable men?\r\n\r\nAnd those who speak thus of this Church speak justly. Is there anything\r\nelse like it? Was there ever anything else like it? The world is full\r\nof ecclesiastical establishments: but such a portent as this Church\r\nof Ireland is nowhere to be found. Look round the Continent of Europe.\r\nEcclesiastical establishments from the White Sea to the Mediterranean:\r\necclesiastical establishments from the Wolga to the Atlantic: but\r\nnowhere the Church of a small minority enjoying exclusive establishment.\r\nLook at America. There you have all forms of Christianity, from\r\nMormonism, if you call Mormonism Christianity, to Romanism. In some\r\nplaces you have the voluntary system. In some you have several religions\r\nconnected with the state. In some you have the solitary ascendency of a\r\nsingle Church. But nowhere, from the Arctic Circle to Cape Horn, do you\r\nfind the Church of a small minority exclusively established. Look round\r\nour own empire. We have an Established Church in England; it is the\r\nChurch of the majority. There is an Established Church in Scotland. When\r\nit was set up, it was the Church of the majority. A few months ago, it\r\nwas the Church of the majority. I am not quite sure that, even after\r\nthe late unhappy disruption, it is the Church of the minority. In our\r\ncolonies the State does much for the support of religion; but in no\r\ncolony, I believe, do we give exclusive support to the religion of the\r\nminority. Nay, even in those parts of empire where the great body of the\r\npopulation is attached to absurd and immoral superstitions, you have not\r\nbeen guilty of the folly and injustice of calling on them to pay for a\r\nChurch which they do not want. We have not portioned out Bengal and the\r\nCarnatic into parishes, and scattered Christian rectors, with stipends\r\nand glebes, among millions of Pagans and Mahometans. We keep, indeed,\r\na small Christian establishment, or rather three small Christian\r\nestablishments, Anglican, Presbyterian, and Catholic. But we keep them\r\nonly for the Christians in our civil and military services; and we leave\r\nuntouched the revenues of the mosques and temples. In one country alone\r\nis to be seen the spectacle of a community of eight millions of\r\nhuman beings, with a Church which is the Church of only eight hundred\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\nIt has been often said, and has been repeated to-night by the honourable\r\nMember for Radnor, that this Church, though it includes only a tenth\r\npart of the population, has more than half the wealth of Ireland. But\r\nis that an argument in favour of the present system? Is it not the\r\nstrongest argument that can be urged in favour of an entire change?\r\nIt is true that there are many cases in which it is fit that property\r\nshould prevail over number. Those cases may, I think, be all arranged in\r\ntwo classes. One class consists of those cases in which the preservation\r\nor improvement of property is the object in view. Thus, in a railway\r\ncompany, nothing can be more reasonable than that one proprietor who\r\nholds five hundred shares should have more power than five proprietors\r\nwho hold one share each. The other class of cases in which property may\r\njustly confer privileges is where superior intelligence is required.\r\nProperty is indeed but a very imperfect test of intelligence. But, when\r\nwe are legislating on a large scale, it is perhaps the best which we\r\ncan apply. For where there is no property, there can very seldom be any\r\nmental cultivation. It is on this principle that special jurors, who\r\nhave to try causes of peculiar nicety, are taken from a wealthier order\r\nthan that which furnishes common jurors. But there cannot be a more\r\nfalse analogy than to reason from these cases to the case of an\r\nEstablished Church. So far is it from being true that, in establishing\r\na Church, we ought to pay more regard to one rich man than to five poor\r\nmen, that the direct reverse is the sound rule. We ought to pay more\r\nregard to one poor man than to five rich men. For, in the first place,\r\nthe public ordinances of religion are of far more importance to the poor\r\nman than to the rich man. I do not mean to say that a rich man may not\r\nbe the better for hearing sermons and joining in public prayers. But\r\nthese things are not indispensable to him; and, if he is so situated\r\nthat he cannot have them, he may find substitutes. He has money to buy\r\nbooks, time to study them, understanding to comprehend them. Every\r\nday he may commune with the minds of Hooker, Leighton, and Barrow. He\r\ntherefore stands less in need of the oral instruction of a divine than a\r\npeasant who cannot read, or who, if he can read, has no money to procure\r\nbooks, or leisure to peruse them. Such a peasant, unless instructed by\r\nword of mouth, can know no more of Christianity than a wild Hottentot.\r\nNor is this all. The poor man not only needs the help of a minister of\r\nreligion more than the rich man, but is also less able to procure it.\r\nIf there were no Established Church, people in our rank of life would\r\nalways be provided with preachers to their mind at an expense which\r\nthey would scarcely feel. But when a poor man, who can hardly give his\r\nchildren their fill of potatoes, has to sell his pig in order to pay\r\nsomething to his priest, the burden is a heavy one. This is, in fact,\r\nthe strongest reason for having an established church in any country. It\r\nis the one reason which prevents me from joining with the partisans of\r\nthe voluntary system. I should think their arguments unanswerable if the\r\nquestion regarded the upper and middle classes only. If I would keep up\r\nthe Established Church of England, it is not for the sake of lords, and\r\nbaronets, and country gentlemen of five thousand pounds a-year, and rich\r\nbankers in the city. I know that such people will always have churches,\r\naye, and cathedrals, and organs, and rich communion plate. The person\r\nabout whom I am uneasy is the working man; the man who would find it\r\ndifficult to pay even five shillings or ten shillings a-year out of his\r\nsmall earnings for the ministrations of religion. What is to become\r\nof him under the voluntary system? Is he to go without religious\r\ninstruction altogether? That we should all think a great evil to\r\nhimself, and a great evil to society. Is he to pay for it out of his\r\nslender means? That would be a heavy tax. Is he to be dependent on\r\nthe liberality of others? That is a somewhat precarious and a somewhat\r\nhumiliating dependence. I prefer, I own, that system under which there\r\nis, in the rudest and most secluded district, a house of God, where\r\npublic worship is performed after a fashion acceptable to the great\r\nmajority of the community, and where the poorest may partake of the\r\nordinances of religion, not as an alms, but as a right. But does\r\nthis argument apply to a Church like the Church of Ireland? It is not\r\nnecessary on this occasion to decide whether the arguments in favour\r\nof the ecclesiastical establishments, or the arguments in favour of the\r\nvoluntary system, be the stronger. There are weighty considerations on\r\nboth sides. Balancing them as well as I can, I think that, as respects\r\nEngland, the preponderance is on the side of the Establishment. But,\r\nas respects Ireland, there is no balancing. All the weights are in one\r\nscale. All the arguments which incline us against the Church of England,\r\nand all the arguments which incline us in favour of the Church of\r\nEngland, are alike arguments against the Church of Ireland; against the\r\nChurch of the few; against the Church of the wealthy; against the Church\r\nwhich, reversing every principle on which a Christian Church should be\r\nfounded, fills the rich with its good things, and sends the hungry empty\r\naway.\r\n\r\nOne view which has repeatedly, both in this House and out of it, been\r\ntaken of the Church of Ireland, seems to deserve notice. It is admitted,\r\nas indeed it could not well be denied, that this Church does not\r\nperform the functions which are everywhere else expected from similar\r\ninstitutions; that it does not instruct the body of the people; that\r\nit does not administer religious consolation to the body of the people.\r\nBut, it is said, we must regard this Church as an aggressive Church,\r\na proselytising Church, a Church militant among spiritual enemies. Its\r\noffice is to spread Protestantism over Munster and Connaught. I remember\r\nwell that, eleven years ago, when Lord Grey's Government proposed to\r\nreduce the number of Irish bishoprics, this language was held. It was\r\nacknowledged that there were more bishops than the number of persons\r\nthen in communion with the Established Church required. But that number,\r\nwe were assured, would not be stationary; and the hierarchy, therefore,\r\nought to be constituted with a view to the millions of converts who\r\nwould soon require the care of Protestant pastors. I well remember\r\nthe strong expression which was then used by my honourable friend, the\r\nMember for the University of Oxford. We must, he said, make allowance\r\nfor the expansive force of Protestantism. A few nights ago a noble lord\r\nfor whom I, in common with the whole House, feel the greatest respect,\r\nthe Member for Dorsetshire (Lord Ashley.), spoke of the missionary\r\ncharacter of the Church of Ireland. Now, Sir, if such language had been\r\nheld at the Council Board of Queen Elizabeth when the constitution of\r\nthis Church was first debated there, there would have been no cause for\r\nwonder. Sir William Cecil or Sir Nicholas Bacon might very naturally\r\nhave said, \"There are few Protestants now in Ireland, it is true. But\r\nwhen we consider how rapidly the Protestant theology has spread, when\r\nwe remember that it is little more than forty years since Martin Luther\r\nbegan to preach against indulgences, and when we see that one half of\r\nEurope is now emancipated from the old superstition, we may reasonably\r\nexpect that the Irish will soon follow the example of the other nations\r\nwhich have embraced the doctrines of the Reformation.\" Cecil, I say,\r\nand his colleagues might naturally entertain this expectation, and might\r\nwithout absurdity make preparations for an event which they regarded\r\nas in the highest degree probable. But we, who have seen this system in\r\nfull operation from the year 1560 to the year 1845, ought to have been\r\ntaught better, unless indeed we are past all teaching. Two hundred and\r\neighty-five years has this Church been at work. What could have been\r\ndone for it in the way of authority, privileges, endowments, which has\r\nnot been done? Did any other set of bishops and priests in the world\r\never receive so much for doing so little? Nay, did any other set of\r\nbishops and priests in the world ever receive half as much for doing\r\ntwice as much? And what have we to show for all this lavish expenditure?\r\nWhat but the most zealous Roman Catholic population on the face of the\r\nearth? Where you were one hundred years ago, where you were two hundred\r\nyears ago, there you are still, not victorious over the domain of the\r\nold faith, but painfully and with dubious success defending your own\r\nfrontier, your own English pale. Sometimes a deserter leaves you.\r\nSometimes a deserter steals over to you. Whether your gains or losses\r\nof this sort be the greater I do not know; nor is it worth while to\r\ninquire. On the great solid mass of the Roman Catholic population you\r\nhave made no impression whatever. There they are, as they were ages ago,\r\nten to one against the members of your Established Church. Explain this\r\nto me. I speak to you, the zealous Protestants on the other side of the\r\nHouse. Explain this to me on Protestant principles. If I were a Roman\r\nCatholic, I could easily account for the phenomena. If I were a Roman\r\nCatholic, I should content myself with saying that the mighty hand and\r\nthe outstretched arm had been put forth, according to the promise, in\r\ndefence of the unchangeable Church; that He who in the old time turned\r\ninto blessings the curses of Balaam, and smote the host of Sennacherib,\r\nhad signally confounded the arts of heretic statesmen. But what is\r\na Protestant to say? He holds that, through the whole of this long\r\nconflict, during which ten generations of men have been born and have\r\ndied, reason and Scripture have been on the side of the Established\r\nClergy. Tell us then what we are to say of this strange war, in which,\r\nreason and Scripture backed by wealth, by dignity, by the help of the\r\ncivil power, have been found no match for oppressed and destitute error?\r\nThe fuller our conviction that our doctrines are right, the fuller, if\r\nwe are rational men, must be our conviction that our tactics have been\r\nwrong, and that we have been encumbering the cause which we meant to\r\naid.\r\n\r\nObserve, it is not only the comparative number of Roman Catholics\r\nand Protestants that may justly furnish us with matter for serious\r\nreflection. The quality as well as the quantity of Irish Romanism\r\ndeserves to be considered. Is there any other country inhabited by a\r\nmixed population of Catholics and Protestants, any other country in\r\nwhich Protestant doctrines have long been freely promulgated from the\r\npress and from the pulpit, where the Roman Catholics spirit is so strong\r\nas in Ireland? I believe not. The Belgians are generally considered as\r\nvery stubborn and zealous Roman Catholics. But I do not believe that\r\neither in stubbornness or in zeal they equal the Irish. And this is\r\nthe fruit of three centuries of Protestant archbishops, bishops,\r\narchdeacons, deans, and rectors. And yet where is the wonder? Is this\r\na miracle that we should stand aghast at it? Not at all. It is a result\r\nwhich human prudence ought to have long ago foreseen and long ago\r\naverted. It is the natural succession of effect to cause. If you do not\r\nunderstand it, it is because you do not understand what the nature and\r\noperation of a church is. There are parts of the machinery of Government\r\nwhich may be just as efficient when they are hated as when they are\r\nloved. An army, a navy, a preventive service, a police force, may do\r\ntheir work whether the public feeling be with them or against them.\r\nWhether we dislike the corn laws or not, your custom houses and your\r\ncoast guard keep out foreign corn. The multitude at Manchester was not\r\nthe less effectually dispersed by the yeomanry, because the interference\r\nof the yeomanry excited the bitterest indignation. There the object was\r\nto produce a material effect; the material means were sufficient; and\r\nnothing more was required. But a Church exists for moral ends. A Church\r\nexists to be loved, to be reverenced, to be heard with docility,\r\nto reign in the understandings and hearts of men. A Church which is\r\nabhorred is useless or worse than useless; and to quarter a hostile\r\nChurch on a conquered people, as you would quarter a soldiery, is\r\ntherefore the most absurd of mistakes. This mistake our ancestors\r\ncommitted. They posted a Church in Ireland just as they posted garrisons\r\nin Ireland. The garrisons did their work. They were disliked. But that\r\nmattered not. They had their forts and their arms; and they kept down\r\nthe aboriginal race. But the Church did not do its work. For to that\r\nwork the love and confidence of the people were essential.\r\n\r\nI may remark in passing that, even under more favourable circumstances\r\na parochial priesthood is not a good engine for the purpose of making\r\nproselytes. The Church of Rome, whatever we may think of her ends, has\r\nshown no want of sagacity in the choice of means; and she knows this\r\nwell. When she makes a great aggressive movement,--and many such\r\nmovements she has made with signal success,--she employs, not her\r\nparochial clergy, but a very different machinery. The business of her\r\nparish priests is to defend and govern what has been won. It is by\r\nthe religious orders, and especially by the Jesuits, that the great\r\nacquisitions have been made. In Ireland your parochial clergy lay under\r\ntwo great disadvantages. They were endowed, and they were hated; so\r\nrichly endowed that few among them cared to turn missionaries; so\r\nbitterly hated that those few had but little success. They long\r\ncontented themselves with receiving the emoluments arising from their\r\nbenefices, and neglected those means to which, in other parts of Europe,\r\nProtestantism had owed its victory. It is well known that of all the\r\ninstruments employed by the Reformers of Germany, of England, and of\r\nScotland, for the purpose of moving the public mind, the most powerful\r\nwas the Bible translated into the vernacular tongues. In Ireland the\r\nProtestant Church had been established near half a century before the\r\nNew Testament was printed in Erse. The whole Bible was not printed\r\nin Erse till this Church had existed more than one hundred and twenty\r\nyears. Nor did the publication at last take place under the patronage\r\nof the lazy and wealthy hierarchy. The expense was defrayed by a layman,\r\nthe illustrious Robert Boyle. So things went on century after century.\r\nSwift, more than a hundred years ago, described the prelates of his\r\ncountry as men gorged with wealth and sunk in indolence, whose chief\r\nbusiness was to bow and job at the Castle. The only spiritual function,\r\nhe says, which they performed was ordination; and, when he saw what\r\npersons they ordained, he doubted whether it would not be better that\r\nthey should neglect that function as they neglected every other. Those,\r\nSir, are now living who can well remember how the revenues of\r\nthe richest see in Ireland were squandered on the shores of the\r\nMediterranean by a bishop, whose epistles, very different compositions\r\nfrom the epistles of Saint Peter and Saint John, may be found in the\r\ncorrespondence of Lady Hamilton. Such abuses as these called forth\r\nno complaint, no reprimand. And all this time the true pastors of the\r\npeople, meanly fed and meanly clothed, frowned upon by the law,\r\nexposed to the insults of every petty squire who gloried in the name\r\nof Protestant, were to be found in miserable cabins, amidst filth, and\r\nfamine, and contagion, instructing the young, consoling the miserable,\r\nholding up the crucifix before the eyes of the dying. Is it strange\r\nthat, in such circumstances, the Roman Catholic religion should have\r\nbeen constantly becoming dearer and dearer to an ardent and sensitive\r\npeople, and that your Established Church should have been constantly\r\nsinking lower and lower in their estimation? I do not of course hold\r\nthe living clergy of the Irish Church answerable for the faults of\r\ntheir predecessors. God forbid! To do so would be the most flagitious\r\ninjustice. I know that a salutary change has taken place. I have no\r\nreason to doubt that in learning and regularity of life the Protestant\r\nclergy of Ireland are on a level with the clergy of England. But in the\r\nway of making proselytes they do as little as those who preceded them.\r\nAn enmity of three hundred years separates the nation from those who\r\nshould be its teachers. In short, it is plain that the mind of Ireland\r\nhas taken its ply, and is not to be bent in a different direction, or,\r\nat all events, is not to be so bent by your present machinery.\r\n\r\nWell, then, this Church is inefficient as a missionary Church. But there\r\nis yet another end which, in the opinion of some eminent men, a Church\r\nis meant to serve. That end has been often in the minds of practical\r\npoliticians. But the first speculative politician who distinctly pointed\r\nit out was Mr Hume. Mr Hume, as might have been expected from his known\r\nopinions, treated the question merely as it related to the temporal\r\nhappiness of mankind; and, perhaps, it may be doubted whether he took\r\nquite a just view of the manner in which even the temporal happiness of\r\nmankind is affected by the restraints and consolations of religion. He\r\nreasoned thus:--It is dangerous to the peace of society that the public\r\nmind should be violently excited on religious subjects. If you adopt the\r\nvoluntary system, the public mind will always be so excited. For every\r\npreacher, knowing that his bread depends on his popularity, seasons his\r\ndoctrine high, and practises every art for the purpose of obtaining an\r\nascendency over his hearers. But when the Government pays the minister\r\nof religion, he has no pressing motive to inflame the zeal of his\r\ncongregation. He will probably go through his duties in a somewhat\r\nperfunctory manner. His power will not be very formidable; and, such\r\nas it is, it will be employed in support of that order of things under\r\nwhich he finds himself so comfortable. Now, Sir, it is not necessary to\r\ninquire whether Mr Hume's doctrine be sound or unsound. For, sound or\r\nunsound, it furnishes no ground on which you can rest the defence of\r\nthe institution which we are now considering. It is evident that by\r\nestablishing in Ireland the Church of the minority in connection with\r\nthe State, you have produced, in the very highest degree, all those\r\nevils which Mr Hume considered as inseparable from the voluntary system.\r\nYou may go all over the world without finding another country where\r\nreligious differences take a form so dangerous to the peace of society;\r\nwhere the common people are so much under the influence of their\r\npriests; or where the priests who teach the common people are so\r\ncompletely estranged from the civil Government.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Sir, I will sum up what I have said. For what end does the\r\nChurch of Ireland exist? Is that end the instruction and solace of the\r\ngreat body of the people? You must admit that the Church of Ireland has\r\nnot attained that end. Is the end which you have in view the conversion\r\nof the great body of the people from the Roman Catholic religion to a\r\npurer form of Christianity? You must admit that the Church of Ireland\r\nhas not attained that end. Or do you propose to yourselves the end\r\ncontemplated by Mr Hume, the peace and security of civil society? You\r\nmust admit that the Church of Ireland has not attained that end. In\r\nthe name of common sense, then, tell us what good end this Church has\r\nattained; or suffer us to conclude, as I am forced to conclude, that it\r\nis emphatically a bad institution.\r\n\r\nIt does not, I know, necessarily follow that, because an institution\r\nis bad, it is therefore to be immediately destroyed. Sometimes a bad\r\ninstitution takes a strong hold on the hearts of mankind, intertwines\r\nits roots with the very foundations of society, and is not to be removed\r\nwithout serious peril to order, law, and property. For example, I hold\r\npolygamy to be one of the most pernicious practises that exist in the\r\nworld. But if the Legislative Council of India were to pass an Act\r\nprohibiting polygamy, I should think that they were out of their senses.\r\nSuch a measure would bring down the vast fabric of our Indian Empire\r\nwith one crash. But is there any similar reason for dealing tenderly\r\nwith the Established Church of Ireland? That Church, Sir, is not one\r\nof those bad institutions which ought to be spared because they are\r\npopular, and because their fall would injure good institutions. It is,\r\non the contrary, so odious, and its vicinage so much endangers valuable\r\nparts of our polity, that, even if it were in itself a good institution,\r\nthere would be strong reasons for giving it up.\r\n\r\nThe honourable gentleman who spoke last told us that we cannot touch\r\nthis Church without endangering the Legislative Union. Sir, I have given\r\nmy best attention to this important point; and I have arrived at a very\r\ndifferent conclusion. The question to be determined is this:--What is\r\nthe best way of preserving political union between countries in which\r\ndifferent religions prevail? With respect to this question we have,\r\nI think, all the light which history can give us. There is no sort of\r\nexperiment described by Lord Bacon which we have not tried. Inductive\r\nphilosophy is of no value if we cannot trust to the lessons derived from\r\nthe experience of more than two hundred years. England has long been\r\nclosely connected with two countries less powerful than herself,\r\nand differing from herself in religion. The Scottish people are\r\nPresbyterians; the Irish people are Roman Catholics. We determined to\r\nforce the Anglican system on both countries. In both countries great\r\ndiscontent was the result. At length Scotland rebelled. Then Ireland\r\nrebelled. The Scotch and Irish rebellions, taking place at a time when\r\nthe public mind of England was greatly and justly excited, produced the\r\nGreat Rebellion here, and the downfall of the Monarchy, of the Church,\r\nand of the Aristocracy. After the Restoration we again tried the old\r\nsystem. During twenty-eight years we persisted in the attempt to\r\nforce Prelacy on the Scotch; and the consequence was, during those\r\ntwenty-eight years Scotland exhibited a frightful spectacle of misery\r\nand depravity. The history of that period is made up of oppression and\r\nresistance, of insurrections, barbarous punishments, and assassinations.\r\nOne day a crowd of zealous rustics stand desperately on their defence,\r\nand repel the dragoons. Next day the dragoons scatter and hew down the\r\nflying peasantry. One day the kneebones of a wretched Covenanter are\r\nbeaten flat in that accursed boot. Next day the Lord Primate is dragged\r\nout of his carriage by a band of raving fanatics, and, while screaming\r\nfor mercy, is butchered at the feet of his own daughter. So things went\r\non, till at last we remembered that institutions are made for men,\r\nand not men for institutions. A wise Government desisted from the vain\r\nattempt to maintain an Episcopal Establishment in a Presbyterian nation.\r\nFrom that moment the connection between England and Scotland became\r\nevery year closer and closer. There were still, it is true, many causes\r\nof animosity. There was an old antipathy between the nations, the\r\neffect of many blows given and received on both sides. All the greatest\r\ncalamities that had befallen Scotland had been inflicted by England.\r\nThe proudest events in Scottish history were victories obtained over\r\nEngland. Yet all angry feelings died rapidly away. The union of the\r\nnations became complete. The oldest man living does not remember to have\r\nheard any demagogue breathe a wish for separation. Do you believe that\r\nthis would have happened if England had, after the Revolution, persisted\r\nin attempting to force the surplice and the Prayer Book on the Scotch?\r\nI tell you that, if you had adhered to the mad scheme of having a\r\nreligious union with Scotland, you never would have had a cordial\r\npolitical union with her. At this very day you would have had monster\r\nmeetings on the north of the Tweed, and another Conciliation Hall, and\r\nanother repeal button, with the motto, \"Nemo me impune lacessit.\" In\r\nfact, England never would have become the great power that she is. For\r\nScotland would have been, not an addition to the effective strength of\r\nthe Empire, but a deduction from it. As often as there was a war with\r\nFrance or Spain, there would have been an insurrection in Scotland. Our\r\ncountry would have sunk into a kingdom of the second class. One such\r\nChurch as that about which we are now debating is a serious encumbrance\r\nto the greatest empire. Two such Churches no empire could bear. You\r\ncontinued to govern Ireland during many generations as you had governed\r\nScotland in the days of Lauderdale and Dundee. And see the result.\r\nIreland has remained, indeed, a part of your Empire. But you know her\r\nto be a source of weakness rather than of strength. Her misery is a\r\nreproach to you. Her discontent doubles the dangers of war. Can you,\r\nwith such facts before you, doubt about the course which you ought to\r\ntake? Imagine a physician with two patients, both afflicted with the\r\nsame disease. He applies the same sharp remedies to both. Both become\r\nworse and worse with the same inflammatory symptoms. Then he changes\r\nhis treatment of one case, and gives soothing medicines. The sufferer\r\nrevives, grows better day by day, and is at length restored to perfect\r\nhealth. The other patient is still subjected to the old treatment, and\r\nbecomes constantly more and more disordered. How would a physician act\r\nin such a case? And are not the principles of experimental philosophy\r\nthe same in politics as in medicine?\r\n\r\nTherefore, Sir, I am fully prepared to take strong measures with regard\r\nto the Established Church of Ireland. It is not necessary for me to say\r\nprecisely how far I would go. I am aware that it may be necessary,\r\nin this as in other cases, to consent to a compromise. But the more\r\ncomplete the reform which may be proposed, provided always that vested\r\nrights be, as I am sure they will be, held strictly sacred, the more\r\ncordially shall I support it.\r\n\r\nThat some reform is at hand I cannot doubt. In a very short time we\r\nshall see the evils which I have described mitigated, if not entirely\r\nremoved. A Liberal Administration would make this concession to Ireland\r\nfrom a sense of justice. A Conservative Administration will make it from\r\na sense of danger. The right honourable Baronet has given the Irish a\r\nlesson which will bear fruit. It is a lesson which rulers ought to be\r\nslow to teach; for it is one which nations are but too apt to learn.\r\nWe have repeatedly been told by acts--we are now told almost in express\r\nwords--that agitation and intimidation are the means which ought to be\r\nemployed by those who wish for redress of grievances from the party now\r\nin power. Such indeed has too long been the policy of England towards\r\nIreland; but it was surely never before avowed with such indiscreet\r\nfrankness. Every epoch which is remembered with pleasure on the other\r\nside of St George's Channel coincides with some epoch which we here\r\nconsider as disastrous and perilous. To the American war and the\r\nvolunteers the Irish Parliament owed its independence. To the French\r\nrevolutionary war the Irish Roman Catholics owed the elective franchise.\r\nIt was in vain that all the great orators and statesmen of two\r\ngenerations exerted themselves to remove the Roman Catholic\r\ndisabilities, Burke, Fox, Pitt, Windham, Grenville, Grey, Plunkett,\r\nWellesley, Grattan, Canning, Wilberforce. Argument and expostulation\r\nwere fruitless. At length pressure of a stronger kind was boldly and\r\nskilfully applied; and soon all difficulties gave way. The Catholic\r\nAssociation, the Clare election, the dread of civil war, produced the\r\nEmancipation Act. Again, the cry of No Popery was raised. That cry was\r\nsuccessful. A faction which had reviled in the bitterest terms the mild\r\nadministration of Whig Viceroys, and which was pledged to the wholesale\r\ndisfranchisement of the Roman Catholics, rose to power. One leading\r\nmember of that faction had drawn forth loud cheers by declaiming against\r\nthe minions of Popery. Another had designated six millions of Irish\r\nCatholics as aliens. A third had publicly declared his conviction, that\r\na time was at hand when all Protestants of every persuasion would find\r\nit necessary to combine firmly against the encroachments of Romanism.\r\nFrom such men we expected nothing but oppression and intolerance. We are\r\nagreeably disappointed to find that a series of conciliatory bills is\r\nbrought before us. But, in the midst of our delight, we cannot refrain\r\nfrom asking for some explanation of so extraordinary a change. We are\r\ntold in reply, that the monster meetings of 1843 were very formidable,\r\nand that our relations with America are in a very unsatisfactory state.\r\nThe public opinion of Ireland is to be consulted, the religion of\r\nIreland is to be treated with respect, not because equity and humanity\r\nplainly enjoin that course; for equity and humanity enjoined that\r\ncourse as plainly when you were calumniating Lord Normanby, and hurrying\r\nforward your Registration Bill; but because Mr O'Connell and Mr Polk\r\nhave between them made you very uneasy. Sir, it is with shame, with\r\nsorrow, and, I will add, with dismay, that I listen to such language.\r\nI have hitherto disapproved of the monster meetings of 1843. I have\r\ndisapproved of the way in which Mr O'Connell and some other Irish\r\nrepresentatives have seceded from this House. I should not have chosen\r\nto apply to those gentlemen the precise words which were used on a\r\nformer occasion by the honourable and learned Member for Bath. But I\r\nagreed with him in substance. I thought it highly to the honour of my\r\nright honourable friend the Member for Dungarvon, and of my honourable\r\nfriends the Members for Kildare, for Roscommon, and for the city of\r\nWaterford, that they had the moral courage to attend the service of this\r\nHouse, and to give us the very valuable assistance which they are, in\r\nvarious ways, so well qualified to afford. But what am I to say now? How\r\ncan I any longer deny that the place where an Irish gentleman may best\r\nserve his country is Conciliation Hall? How can I expect that any Irish\r\nRoman Catholic can be very sorry to learn that our foreign relations are\r\nin an alarming state, or can rejoice to hear that all danger of war has\r\nblown over? I appeal to the Conservative Members of this House. I ask\r\nthem whither we are hastening? I ask them what is to be the end of a\r\npolicy of which it is the principle to give nothing to justice,\r\nand everything to fear? We have been accused of truckling to Irish\r\nagitators. But I defy you to show us that we ever made or are now making\r\nto Ireland a single concession which was not in strict conformity with\r\nour known principles. You may therefore trust us, when we tell you\r\nthat there is a point where we will stop. Our language to the Irish is\r\nthis:--\"You ask for emancipation: it was agreeable to our principles\r\nthat you should have it; and we assisted you to obtain it. You wished\r\nfor a municipal system, as popular as that which exists in England: we\r\nthought your wish reasonable, and did all in our power to gratify it.\r\nThis grant to Maynooth is, in our opinion, proper; and we will do our\r\nbest to obtain it for you, though it should cost us our popularity and\r\nour seats in Parliament. The Established Church in your island, as now\r\nconstituted, is a grievance of which you justly complain. We will strive\r\nto redress that grievance. The Repeal of the Union we regard as fatal to\r\nthe empire: and we never will consent to it; never, though the country\r\nshould be surrounded by dangers as great as those which threatened her\r\nwhen her American colonies, and France, and Spain, and Holland, were\r\nleagued against her, and when the armed neutrality of the Baltic\r\ndisputed her maritime rights; never, though another Bonaparte should\r\npitch his camp in sight of Dover Castle; never, till all has been staked\r\nand lost; never, till the four quarters of the world have been convulsed\r\nby the last struggle of the great English people for their place\r\namong the nations.\" This, Sir, is the true policy. When you give, give\r\nfrankly. When you withhold, withhold resolutely. Then what you give is\r\nreceived with gratitude; and, as for what you withhold, men, seeing that\r\nto wrest it from you is no safe or easy enterprise, cease to hope\r\nfor it, and, in time, cease to wish for it. But there is a way of so\r\nwithholding as merely to excite desire, and of so giving as merely to\r\nexcite contempt; and that way the present ministry has discovered. Is it\r\npossible for me to doubt that in a few months the same machinery which\r\nsixteen years ago extorted from the men now in power the Emancipation\r\nAct, and which has now extorted from them the bill before us, will again\r\nbe put in motion? Who shall say what will be the next sacrifice? For my\r\nown part I firmly believe that, if the present Ministers remain in power\r\nfive years longer, and if we should have,--which God avert!--a war with\r\nFrance or America, the Established Church of Ireland will be given\r\nup. The right honourable Baronet will come down to make a proposition\r\nconceived in the very spirit of the Motions which have repeatedly been\r\nmade by my honourable friend the Member for Sheffield. He will again\r\nbe deserted by his followers; he will again be dragged through his\r\ndifficulties by his opponents. Some honest Lord of the Treasury may\r\ndetermine to quit his office rather than belie all the professions of a\r\nlife. But there will be little difficulty in finding a successor ready\r\nto change all his opinions at twelve hours' notice. I may perhaps, while\r\ncordially supporting the bill, again venture to say something about\r\nconsistency, and about the importance of maintaining a high standard\r\nof political morality. The right honourable Baronet will again tell me,\r\nthat he is anxious only for the success of his measure, and that he does\r\nnot choose to reply to taunts. And the right honourable gentleman the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer will produce Hansard, will read to the House\r\nmy speech of this night, and will most logically argue that I ought not\r\nto reproach the Ministers with their inconsistency, seeing that I had,\r\nfrom my knowledge of their temper and principles, predicted to a tittle\r\nthe nature and extent of that inconsistency.\r\n\r\nSir, I have thought it my duty to brand with strong terms of\r\nreprehension the practice of conceding, in time of public danger, what\r\nis obstinately withheld in time of public tranquillity. I am prepared,\r\nand have long been prepared, to grant much, very much, to Ireland. But\r\nif the Repeal Association were to dissolve itself to-morrow, and if the\r\nnext steamer were to bring news that all our differences with the United\r\nStates were adjusted in the most honourable and friendly manner, I would\r\ngrant to Ireland neither more nor less than I would grant if we were on\r\nthe eve of a rebellion like that of 1798; if war were raging all along\r\nthe Canadian frontier; and if thirty French sail of the line were\r\nconfronting our fleet in St George's Channel. I give my vote from my\r\nheart and soul for the amendment of my honourable friend. He calls on\r\nus to make to Ireland a concession, which ought in justice to have been\r\nmade long ago, and which may be made with grace and dignity even now. I\r\nwell know that you will refuse to make it now. I know as well that you\r\nwill make it hereafter. You will make it as every concession to Ireland\r\nhas been made. You will make it when its effect will be, not to appease,\r\nbut to stimulate agitation. You will make it when it will be regarded,\r\nnot as a great act of national justice, but as a confession of national\r\nweakness. You will make it in such a way, and at such a time, that there\r\nwill be but too much reason to doubt whether more mischief has been done\r\nby your long refusal, or by your tardy and enforced compliance.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEOLOGICAL TESTS IN THE SCOTCH UNIVERSITIES. (JULY 9, 1845) A SPEECH\r\nDELIVERED IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS ON THE 9TH OF JULY 1845.\r\n\r\nOn the first of May, 1845, Mr Rutherford, Member for Leith, obtained\r\nleave to bring in a bill to regulate admission to the Secular Chairs\r\nin the Universities of Scotland. On the morning of the sixth of May the\r\nbill was read a first time, and remained two months on the table of the\r\nHouse. At length the second reading was fixed for the ninth of July. Mr\r\nRutherfurd was unable to attend on that day: and it was necessary that\r\none of his friends should supply his place. Accordingly, as soon as the\r\nOrder of the Day had been read, the following Speech was made.\r\n\r\nOn a division the bill was rejected by 116 votes to 108. But, in the\r\nstate in which parties then were, this defeat was generally considered\r\nas a victory.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker,--I have been requested by my honourable and learned friend,\r\nthe Member for Leith, to act as his substitute on this occasion. I am\r\ntruly sorry that any substitute should be necessary. I am truly sorry\r\nthat he is not among us to take charge of the bill which he not long ago\r\nintroduced with one of the most forcible and luminous speeches that I\r\never had the pleasure of hearing. His audience was small; but the few\r\nwho formed that audience cannot have forgotten the effect which his\r\narguments and his eloquence produced. The Ministers had come down to\r\nresist his motion: but their courage failed them: they hesitated: they\r\nconferred together: at last they consented that he should have leave\r\nto bring in his bill. Such, indeed, was the language which they held on\r\nthat and on a subsequent occasion, that both my honourable and learned\r\nfriend and myself gave them more credit than they deserved. We really\r\nbelieved that they had resolved to offer no opposition to a law which it\r\nwas quite evident that they perceived to be just and beneficial. But\r\nwe have been disappointed. It has been notified to us that the whole\r\ninfluence of the Government is to be exerted against our bill. In such\r\ndiscouraging circumstances it is that I rise to move the second reading.\r\n\r\nYet, Sir, I do not altogether despair of success. When I consider what\r\nstrong, what irresistible reasons we have to urge, I can hardly think\r\nit possible that the mandate of the most powerful administration can\r\nprevail against them. Nay, I should consider victory, not merely\r\nas probable, but as certain, if I did not know how imperfect is the\r\ninformation which English gentlemen generally possess concerning Scotch\r\nquestions. It is because I know this that I think it my duty to depart\r\nfrom the ordinary practice, and, instead of simply moving the second\r\nreading, to explain at some length the principles on which this bill has\r\nbeen framed. I earnestly entreat those English Members who were not so\r\nfortunate as to hear the speech of my honourable and learned friend, the\r\nMember for Leith to favour me with their attention. They will, I think,\r\nadmit, that I have a right to be heard with indulgence. I have been sent\r\nto this house by a great city which was once a capital, the abode of a\r\nSovereign, the place where the Estates of a realm held their sittings.\r\nFor the general good of the empire, Edinburgh descended from that high\r\neminence. But, ceasing to be a political metropolis, she became an\r\nintellectual metropolis. For the loss of a Court, of a Privy Council, of\r\na Parliament, she found compensation in the prosperity and splendour of\r\nan University renowned to the farthest ends of the earth as a school of\r\nphysical and moral science. This noble and beneficent institution is now\r\nthreatened with ruin by the folly of the Government, and by the violence\r\nof an ecclesiastical faction which is bent on persecution without having\r\nthe miserable excuse of fanaticism. Nor is it only the University of\r\nEdinburgh that is in danger. In pleading for that University, I plead\r\nfor all the great academical institutions of Scotland. The fate of all\r\ndepends on the event of this debate; and, in the name of all, I demand\r\nthe attention of every man who loves either learning or religious\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nThe first question which we have to consider is, whether the principles\r\nof the bill be sound. I believe that they are sound; and I am quite\r\nconfident that nobody who sits on the Treasury Bench will venture to\r\npronounce them unsound. It does not lie in the mouths of the Ministers\r\nto say that literary instruction and scientific instruction are\r\ninseparably connected with religious instruction. It is not for them to\r\nrail against Godless Colleges. It is not for them to talk with horror of\r\nthe danger of suffering young men to listen to the lectures of an Arian\r\nprofessor of Botany or of a Popish professor of Chemistry. They are\r\nthemselves at this moment setting up in Ireland a system exactly\r\nresembling the system which we wish to set up in Scotland. Only a few\r\nhours have elapsed since they were themselves labouring to prove that,\r\nin a country in which a large proportion of those who require a liberal\r\neducation are dissenters from the Established Church, it is desirable\r\nthat there should be schools without theological tests. The right\r\nhonourable Baronet at the head of the Government proposes that in the\r\nnew colleges which he is establishing at Belfast, Cork, Limerick, and\r\nGalway, the professorships shall be open to men of every creed: and\r\nhe has strenuously defended that part of his plan against attacks from\r\nopposite quarters, against the attacks of zealous members of the Church\r\nof England, and of zealous members of the Church of Rome. Only the day\r\nbefore yesterday the honourable Baronet the Member for North Devon (Sir\r\nThomas Acland.) ventured to suggest a test as unobjectionable as a test\r\ncould well be. He would merely have required the professors to declare\r\ntheir general belief in the divine authority of the Old and New\r\nTestaments. But even this amendment the First Lord of the Treasury\r\nresisted, and I think quite rightly. He told us that it was quite\r\nunnecessary to institute an inquisition into the religious opinions of\r\npeople whose business was merely to teach secular knowledge, and that it\r\nwas absurd to imagine that any man of learning would disgrace and ruin\r\nhimself by preaching infidelity from the Greek chair or the Mathematical\r\nchair.\r\n\r\nSome members of this House certainly held very different language: but\r\ntheir arguments made as little impression on Her Majesty's Ministers as\r\non me. We were told with the utmost earnestness that secular knowledge,\r\nunaccompanied by a sound religious faith, and unsanctified by religious\r\nfeeling, was not only useless, but positively noxious, a curse to the\r\npossessor, a curse to society. I feel the greatest personal kindness and\r\nrespect for some gentlemen who hold this language. But they must pardon\r\nme if I say that the proposition which they have so confidently laid\r\ndown, however well it may sound in pious ears while it is expressed in\r\ngeneral terms, to be too monstrous, too ludicrous, for grave refutation.\r\nIs it seriously meant that, if the Captain of an Indiaman is a Socinian,\r\nit would be better for himself, his crew, and his passengers, that he\r\nshould not know how to use his quadrant and his chronometers? Is it\r\nseriously meant that, if a druggist is a Swedenborgian, it would\r\nbe better for himself and his customers that he should not know the\r\ndifference between Epsom salts and oxalic acid? A hundred millions of\r\nthe Queen's Asiatic subjects are Mahometans and Pagans. Is it seriously\r\nmeant that it is desirable that they should be as ignorant as the\r\naboriginal inhabitants of New South Wales, that they should have no\r\nalphabet, that they should have no arithmetic, that they should not know\r\nhow to build a bridge, how to sink a well, how to irrigate a field? If\r\nit be true that secular knowledge, unsanctified by true religion, is\r\na positive evil, all these consequences follow. Yet surely they are\r\nconsequences from which every sane mind must recoil. It is a great evil,\r\nno doubt, that a man should be a heretic or an atheist. But I am quite\r\nat a loss to understand how this evil is mitigated by his not knowing\r\nthat the earth moves round the sun, that by the help of a lever, a small\r\npower will lift a great weight, that Virginia is a republic, or that\r\nParis is the capital of France.\r\n\r\nOn these grounds, Sir, I have cordially supported the Irish Colleges\r\nBill. But the principle of the Irish Colleges and the principle of the\r\nbill which I hold in my hand are exactly the same: and the House and the\r\ncountry have a right to know why the authors of the former bill are the\r\nopponents of the latter bill. One distinction there is, I admit, between\r\nIreland and Scotland. It is true that in Scotland there is no clamour\r\nagainst the Union with England. It is true that in Scotland no demagogue\r\ncan obtain applause and riches by slandering and reviling the English\r\npeople. It is true that in Scotland there is no traitor who would dare\r\nto say that he regards the enemies of the state as his allies. In every\r\nextremity the Scottish nation will be found faithful to the common cause\r\nof the empire. But Her Majesty's Ministers will hardly I think, venture\r\nto say that this is their reason for refusing to Scotland the boon which\r\nthey propose to confer on Ireland. And yet, if this be not their reason,\r\nwhat reason can we find? Observe how strictly analogous the cases are.\r\nYou give it as a reason for establishing in Ireland colleges without\r\ntests that the Established Church of Ireland is the Church of the\r\nminority. Unhappily it may well be doubted whether the Established\r\nChurch of Scotland, too, be not now, thanks to your policy, the Church\r\nof the minority. It is true that the members of the Established Church\r\nof Scotland are about a half of the whole population of Scotland; and\r\nthat the members of the Established Church of Ireland are not much more\r\nthan a tenth of the whole population of Ireland. But the question now\r\nbefore us does not concern the whole population. It concerns only the\r\nclass which requires academical education: and I do not hesitate to say\r\nthat, in the class which requires academical education, in the class for\r\nthe sake of which universities exist, the proportion of persons who\r\ndo not belong to the Established Church is as great in Scotland as in\r\nIreland. You tell us that sectarian education in Ireland is an evil. Is\r\nit less an evil in Scotland? You tell us that it is desirable that the\r\nProtestant and the Roman Catholic should study together at Cork. Is it\r\nless desirable that the son of an elder of the Established Church\r\nand the son of an elder of the Free Church should study together at\r\nEdinburgh? You tell us that it is not reasonable to require from a\r\nProfessor of Astronomy or Surgery in Connaught a declaration that\r\nhe believes in the Gospels. On what ground, then, can you think it\r\nreasonable to require from every Professor in Scotland a declaration\r\nthat he approves of the Presbyterian form of church government? I defy\r\nyou, with all your ingenuity, to find one argument, one rhetorical\r\ntopic, against our bill which may not be used with equal effect against\r\nyour own Irish Colleges Bill.\r\n\r\nIs there any peculiarity in the academical system of Scotland which\r\nmakes these tests necessary? Certainly not. The academical system of\r\nScotland has its peculiarities; but they are peculiarities which are not\r\nin harmony with these tests, peculiarities which jar with these tests.\r\nIt is an error to imagine that, by passing this bill, we shall establish\r\na precedent which will lead to a change in the constitution of the\r\nUniversities of Cambridge and Oxford. Whether such a change be or be not\r\ndesirable is a question which must be decided on grounds quite distinct\r\nfrom those on which we rest our case. I entreat English gentlemen not to\r\nbe misled by the word University. That word means two different things\r\non the two different sides of the Tweed. The academical authorities at\r\nCambridge and Oxford stand in a parental relation to the student. They\r\nundertake, not merely to instruct him in philology, geometry, natural\r\nphilosophy, but to form his religious opinions, and to watch over his\r\nmorals. He is to be bred a Churchman. At Cambridge, he cannot graduate,\r\nat Oxford, I believe, he cannot matriculate, without declaring himself\r\na Churchman. The College is a large family. An undergraduate is lodged\r\neither within the gates, or in some private house licensed and regulated\r\nby the academical authorities. He is required to attend public worship\r\naccording to the forms of the Church of England several times every\r\nweek. It is the duty of one officer to note the absence of young men\r\nfrom divine service, of another to note their absence from the public\r\ntable, of another to report those who return home at unseasonably late\r\nhours. An academical police parade the streets at night to seize upon\r\nany unlucky reveller who may be found drunk or in bad company. There are\r\npunishments of various degrees for irregularities of conduct. Sometimes\r\nthe offender has to learn a chapter of the Greek Testament; sometimes\r\nhe is confined to his college; sometimes he is publicly reprimanded:\r\nfor grave offences he is rusticated or expelled. Now, Sir, whether this\r\nsystem be good or bad, efficient or inefficient, I will not now inquire.\r\nThis is evident; that religious tests are perfectly in harmony with such\r\na system. Christ Church and King's College undertake to instruct every\r\nyoung man who goes to them in the doctrines of the Church of England,\r\nand to see that he regularly attends the worship of the Church of\r\nEngland. Whether this ought to be so, I repeat, I will not now inquire:\r\nbut, while it is so, nothing can be more reasonable than to require from\r\nthe rulers of Christ Church and King's College some declaration that\r\nthey are themselves members of the Church of England.\r\n\r\nThe character of the Scotch universities is altogether different. There\r\nyou have no functionaries resembling the Vice-Chancellors and Proctors,\r\nthe Heads of Houses, Tutors and Deans, whom I used to cap at Cambridge.\r\nThere is no chapel; there is no academical authority entitled to ask a\r\nyoung man whether he goes to the parish church or the Quaker meeting, to\r\nsynagogue or to mass. With his moral conduct the university has nothing\r\nto do. The Principal and the whole Academical Senate cannot put any\r\nrestraint, or inflict any punishment, on a lad whom they may see lying\r\ndead drunk in the High Street of Edinburgh. In truth, a student at a\r\nScotch university is in a situation closely resembling that of a medical\r\nstudent in London. There are great numbers of youths in London who\r\nattend St George's Hospital, or St Bartholomew's Hospital. One of these\r\nyouths may also go to Albermarle Street to hear Mr Faraday lecture on\r\nchemistry, or to Willis's rooms to hear Mr Carlyle lecture on German\r\nliterature. On the Sunday he goes perhaps to church, perhaps to the\r\nRoman Catholic chapel, perhaps to the Tabernacle, perhaps nowhere. None\r\nof the gentlemen whose lectures he has attended during the week has the\r\nsmallest right to tell him where he shall worship, or to punish him for\r\ngambling in hells, or tippling in cider cellars. Surely we must all feel\r\nthat it would be the height of absurdity to require Mr Faraday and Mr\r\nCarlyle to subscribe a confession of faith before they lecture; and\r\nin what does their situation differ from the situation of the Scotch\r\nprofessor.\r\n\r\nIn the peculiar character of the Scotch universities, therefore, I find\r\na strong reason for the passing of this bill. I find a reason stronger\r\nstill when I look at the terms of the engagements which exist between\r\nthe English and Scotch nations.\r\n\r\nSome gentlemen, I see, think that I am venturing on dangerous ground. We\r\nhave been told, in confident tones, that, if we pass this bill, we shall\r\ncommit a gross breach of public faith, we shall violate the Treaty\r\nof Union, and the Act of Security. With equal confidence, and with\r\nconfidence much better grounded, I affirm that the Treaty of Union and\r\nthe Act of Security not only do not oblige us to reject this bill, but\r\ndo oblige us to pass this bill, or some bill nearly resembling this.\r\n\r\nThis proposition seems to be regarded by the Ministers as paradoxical:\r\nbut I undertake to prove it by the plainest and fairest argument. I\r\nshall resort to no chicanery. If I did think that the safety of the\r\ncommonwealth required that we should violate the Treaty of Union,\r\nI would violate it openly, and defend my conduct on the ground of\r\nnecessity. It may, in an extreme case, be our duty to break our\r\ncompacts. It never can be our duty to quibble them away. What I say\r\nis that the Treaty of Union, construed, not with the subtlety of a\r\npettifogger, but according to the spirit, binds us to pass this bill or\r\nsome similar bill.\r\n\r\nBy the Treaty of Union it was covenanted that no person should be a\r\nteacher or office-bearer in the Scotch Universities who should not\r\ndeclare that he conformed to the worship and polity of the Established\r\nChurch of Scotland. What Church was meant by the two contracting\r\nparties? What Church was meant, more especially, by the party to the\r\nside of which we ought always to lean, I mean the weaker party? Surely\r\nthe Church established in 1707, when the Union took place. Is then,\r\nthe Church of Scotland at the present moment constituted, on all points\r\nwhich the members of that Church think essential, exactly as it was\r\nconstituted in 1707? Most assuredly not.\r\n\r\nEvery person who knows anything of the ecclesiastical history of\r\nScotland knows that, ever since the Reformation, the great body of the\r\nPresbyterians of that country have held that congregations ought to have\r\na share in the appointment of their ministers. This principle is laid\r\ndown most distinctly in the First Book of Discipline, drawn up by John\r\nKnox. It is laid down, though not quite so strongly, in the Second Book\r\nof Discipline, drawn up by Andrew Melville. And I beg gentlemen, English\r\ngentlemen, to observe that in Scotland this is not regarded as a matter\r\nof mere expediency. All staunch Presbyterians think that the flock is\r\nentitled, jure divino, to a voice in the appointment of the pastor, and\r\nthat to force a pastor on a parish to which he is unacceptable is a sin\r\nas much forbidden by the Word of God as idolatry or perjury. I am quite\r\nsure that I do not exaggerate when I say that the highest of our\r\nhigh churchmen at Oxford cannot attach more importance to episcopal\r\ngovernment and episcopal ordination than many thousands of Scotchmen,\r\nshrewd men, respectable men, men who fear God and honour the Queen,\r\nattach to this right of the people.\r\n\r\nWhen, at the time of the Revolution, the Presbyterian worship and\r\ndiscipline were established in Scotland, the question of patronage was\r\nsettled by a compromise, which was far indeed from satisfying men of\r\nextreme opinions, but which was generally accepted. An Act, passed\r\nat Edinburgh, in 1690, transferred what we should call in England the\r\nadvowsons from the old patrons to parochial councils, composed of the\r\nelders and the Protestant landowners. This system, however imperfect\r\nit might appear to such rigid Covenanters as Davie Deans and Gifted\r\nGilfillan, worked satisfactorily; and the Scotch nation seems to have\r\nbeen contented with its ecclesiastical polity when the Treaty of Union\r\nwas concluded. By that treaty the ecclesiastical polity of Scotland was\r\ndeclared to be unalterable. Nothing, therefore, can be more clear\r\nthan that the Parliament of Great Britain was bound by the most sacred\r\nobligations not to revive those rights of patronage which the Parliament\r\nof Scotland had abolished.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, the Union had not lasted five years when our ancestors were\r\nguilty of a great violation of public faith. The history of that great\r\nfault and of its consequences is full of interest and instruction. The\r\nwrong was committed hastily, and with contumelious levity. The offenders\r\nwere doubtless far from foreseeing that their offence would be visited\r\non the third and fourth generation; that we should be paying in 1845 the\r\npenalty of what they did in 1712.\r\n\r\nIn 1712, Sir, the Whigs, who were the chief authors of the Union, had\r\nbeen driven from power. The prosecution of Sacheverell had made them\r\nodious to the nation. The general election of 1710 had gone against\r\nthem. Tory statesmen were in office. Tory squires formed more than\r\nfive-sixths of this House. The party which was uppermost thought that\r\nEngland had, in 1707, made a bad bargain, a bargain so bad that it could\r\nhardly be considered as binding. The guarantee so solemnly given to\r\nthe Church of Scotland was a subject of loud and bitter complaint.\r\nThe Ministers hated that Church much; and their chief supporters, the\r\ncountry gentlemen and country clergymen of England, hated it still more.\r\nNumerous petty insults were offered to the opinions, or, if you please,\r\nthe prejudices of the Presbyterians. At length it was determined to go\r\nfurther, and to restore to the old patrons those rights which had been\r\ntaken away in 1690. A bill was brought into this House, the history\r\nof which you may trace in our Journals. Some of the entries are very\r\nsignificant. In spite of all remonstrances the Tory majority would not\r\nhear of delay. The Whig minority struggled hard, appealed to the act of\r\nUnion and the Act of Security, and insisted on having both those Acts\r\nread at the table. The bill passed this House, however, before the\r\npeople of Scotland knew that it had been brought in. For there were then\r\nneither reporters nor railroads; and intelligence from Westminster\r\nwas longer in travelling to Cambridge than it now is in travelling\r\nto Aberdeen. The bill was in the House of Lords before the Church\r\nof Scotland could make her voice heard. Then came a petition from a\r\ncommittee appointed by the General Assembly to watch over the interests\r\nof religion while the General Assembly itself was not sitting. The first\r\nname attached to that petition is the name of Principal Carstairs, a man\r\nwho had stood high in the esteem and favour of William the Third, and\r\nwho had borne a chief part in establishing the Presbyterian Church in\r\nScotland. Carstairs and his colleagues appealed to the Act of Union, and\r\nimplored the peers not to violate that Act. But party spirit ran high;\r\npublic faith was disregarded: patronage was restored. To that breach\r\nof the Treaty of Union are to be directly ascribed all the schisms that\r\nhave since rent the Church of Scotland.\r\n\r\nI will not detain the House by giving a minute account of those schisms.\r\nIt is enough to say that the law of patronage produced, first the\r\nsecession of 1733 and the establishment of the Associate Synod, then the\r\nsecession of 1752 and the establishment of the Relief Synod, and finally\r\nthe great secession of 1843 and the establishment of the Free Church.\r\nOnly two years have elapsed since we saw, with mingled admiration and\r\npity, a spectacle worthy of the best ages of the Church. Four hundred\r\nand seventy ministers resigned their stipends, quitted their manses, and\r\nwent forth committing themselves, their wives, their children, to the\r\ncare of Providence. Their congregations followed them by thousands, and\r\nlistened eagerly to the Word of Life in tents, in barns, or on those\r\nhills and moors where the stubborn Presbyterians of a former generation\r\nhad prayed and sung their psalms in defiance of the boot of Lauderdale\r\nand of the sword of Dundee. The rich gave largely of their riches. The\r\npoor contributed with the spirit of her who put her two mites into the\r\ntreasury of Jerusalem. Meanwhile, in all the churches of large towns, of\r\nwhole counties, the established clergy were preaching to empty benches.\r\nAnd of these secessions every one may be distinctly traced to that\r\nviolation of the Treaty of Union which was committed in 1712.\r\n\r\nThis, Sir, is the true history of dissent in Scotland: and, this being\r\nso, how can any man have the front to invoke the Treaty of Union and the\r\nAct of Security against those who are devotedly attached to that system\r\nwhich the Treaty of Union and the Act of Security were designed to\r\nprotect, and who are seceders only because the Treaty of Union and the\r\nAct of Security have been infringed? I implore gentlemen to reflect on\r\nthe manner in which they and their fathers have acted towards the Scotch\r\nPresbyterians. First you bind yourselves by the most solemn obligations\r\nto maintain unaltered their Church as it was constituted in 1707.\r\nFive years later you alter the constitution of their Church in a point\r\nregarded by them as essential. In consequence of your breach of faith\r\nsecession after secession takes place, till at length the Church of\r\nthe State ceases to be the Church of the People. Then you begin to be\r\nsqueamish. Then those articles of the Treaty of Union which, when they\r\nreally were obligatory, you outrageously violated, now when they are\r\nno longer obligatory, now when it is no longer in your power to observe\r\nthem according to the spirit, are represented as inviolable. You first,\r\nby breaking your word, turn hundreds of thousands of Churchmen into\r\nDissenters; and then you punish them for being Dissenters, because,\r\nforsooth, you never break your word. If your consciences really are so\r\ntender, why do you not repeal the Act of 1712? Why do you not put the\r\nChurch of Scotland back into the same situation in which she was in\r\n1707. We have had occasion more than once in the course of this session\r\nto admire the casuistical skill of Her Majesty's Ministers. But I must\r\nsay that even their scruple about slave-grown sugar, though that scruple\r\nis the laughing-stock of all Europe and all America, is respectable\r\nwhen compared with their scruple about the Treaty of Union. Is there the\r\nslightest doubt that every compact ought to be construed according to\r\nthe sense in which it was understood by those who made it? And is there\r\nthe slightest doubt as to the sense in which the compact between England\r\nand Scotland was understood by those who made it? Suppose that we could\r\ncall up from their graves the Presbyterian divines who then sate in the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Suppose that we could call up Carstairs; that we could\r\ncall up Boston, the author of the Fourfold State; that we could relate\r\nto them the history of the ecclesiastical revolutions which have, since\r\ntheir time, taken place in Scotland; and that we could then ask them,\r\n\"Is the Established Church, or is the Free Church, identical with the\r\nChurch which existed at the time of the Union?\" Is it not quite certain\r\nwhat their answer would be? They would say, \"Our Church, the Church\r\nwhich you promised to maintain unalterable, was not the Church which you\r\nprotect, but the Church which you oppress. Our Church was the Church of\r\nChalmers and Brewster, not the Church of Bryce and Muir.\"\r\n\r\nIt is true, Sir, that the Presbyterian dissenters are not the only\r\ndissenters whom this bill will relieve. By the law, as it now stands,\r\nall persons who refuse to declare their approbation of the synodical\r\npolity, that is to say, all persons who refuse to declare that they\r\nconsider episcopal government and episcopal ordination as, at least,\r\nmatters altogether indifferent, are incapable of holding academical\r\noffice in Scotland. Now, Sir, will any gentleman who loves the Church\r\nof England vote for maintaining this law? If, indeed, he were bound by\r\npublic faith to maintain this law, I admit that he would have no choice.\r\nBut I have proved, unless I greatly deceive myself, that he is not\r\nbound by public faith to maintain this law? Can he then conscientiously\r\nsupport the Ministers to-night? If he votes with them, he votes for\r\npersecuting what he himself believes to be the truth. He holds out\r\nto the members of his own Church lures to tempt them to renounce that\r\nChurch, and to join themselves to a Church which he considers as less\r\npure. We may differ as to the propriety of imposing penalties and\r\ndisabilities on heretics. But surely we shall agree in thinking that we\r\nought not to punish men for orthodoxy.\r\n\r\nI know, Sir, that there are many gentlemen who dislike innovation merely\r\nas innovation, and would be glad always to keep things as they are now.\r\nEven to this class of persons I will venture to appeal. I assure them\r\nthat we are not the innovators. I assure them that our object is to keep\r\nthings as they are and as they have long been. In form, I own, we are\r\nproposing a change; but in truth we are resisting a change. The question\r\nreally is, not whether we shall remove old tests, but whether we shall\r\nimpose new ones. The law which we seek to repeal has long been obsolete.\r\nSo completely have the tests been disused that, only the other day, the\r\nright honourable Baronet, the Secretary for the Home Department,\r\nwhen speaking in favour of the Irish Colleges Bill, told us that the\r\nGovernment was not making a rash experiment. \"Our plan,\" he said, \"has\r\nalready been tried at Edinburgh and has succeeded. At Edinburgh the\r\ntests have been disused near a hundred years.\" As to Glasgow the\r\ngentlemen opposite can give us full information from their own\r\nexperience. For there are at least three members of the Cabinet who have\r\nbeen Lords Rectors; the First Lord of the Treasury, and the Secretaries\r\nfor the Home Department and the Colonial Department. They never took\r\nthe test. They probably would not have taken it; for they are all\r\nEpiscopalians. In fact, they belong to the very class which the test\r\nwas especially meant to exclude. The test was not meant to exclude\r\nPresbyterian dissenters; for the Presbyterian Church was not yet rent\r\nby any serious schism. Nor was the test meant to exclude the Roman\r\nCatholics; for against the Roman Catholics there was already abundant\r\nsecurity. The Protestant Episcopalian was the enemy against whom it was,\r\nin 1707, thought peculiarly necessary to take precautions. That those\r\nprecautions have long been disused the three members of the Cabinet whom\r\nI mentioned can certify.\r\n\r\nOn a sudden the law, which had long slept a deep sleep, has been\r\nawakened, stirred up, and put into vigorous action. These obsolete tests\r\nare now, it seems, to be exacted with severity. And why? Simply because\r\nan event has taken place which makes them ten times as unjust and\r\noppressive as they would have been formerly. They were not required\r\nwhile the Established Church was the Church of the majority. They are\r\nto be required solely because a secession has taken place which has made\r\nthe Established Church the Church of the minority. While they could have\r\ndone little mischief they were suffered to lie neglected. They are now\r\nto be used, because a time has come at which they cannot be used without\r\nfatal consequences.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for me to speak without indignation of those who have\r\ntaken the lead in the work of persecution. Yet I must give them credit\r\nfor courage. They have selected as their object of attack no less a man\r\nthan Sir David Brewster, Principal of the University of Saint Andrews.\r\nI hold in my hand the libel, as it is technically called, in which a\r\nPresbytery of the Established Church demands that Sir David, for the\r\ncrime of adhering to that ecclesiastical polity which was guaranteed to\r\nhis country by the Act of Union, shall be \"removed from his office, and\r\nvisited with such other censure or punishment as the laws of the\r\nChurch enjoin, for the glory of God, the safety of the Church, and\r\nthe prosperity of the University, and to deter others holding the same\r\nimportant office from committing the like offence in all time coming,\r\nbut that others may hear and fear the danger and detriment of following\r\ndivisive courses.\" Yes; for the glory of God, the safety of the Church,\r\nand the prosperity of the University. What right, Sir, have the\r\nauthors of such an instrument as this to raise their voices against the\r\ninsolence and intolerance of the Vatican? The glory of God! As to that,\r\nI will only say that this is not the first occasion on which the glory\r\nof God has been made a pretext for the injustice of man. The safety of\r\nthe Church! Sir, if, which God forbid, that Church is really possessed\r\nby the evil spirit which actuates this Presbytery; if that Church,\r\nhaving recently lost hundreds of able ministers and hundreds of\r\nthousands of devout hearers, shall, instead of endeavouring, by\r\nmeekness, and by redoubled diligence, to regain those whom she has\r\nestranged, give them new provocation; if she shall sharpen against them\r\nan old law the edge of which has long rusted off, and which, when it\r\nwas first made, was made not for her defence, but for theirs; then I\r\npronounce the days of that Church numbered. As to the prosperity of the\r\nUniversity, is there a corner of Europe where men of science will not\r\nlaugh when they hear that the prosperity of the University of Saint\r\nAndrews is to be promoted by expelling Sir David Brewster on account\r\nof a theological squabble? The professors of Edinburgh know better\r\nthan this Presbytery how the prosperity of a seat of learning is to be\r\npromoted. There the Academic Senate is almost unanimous in favour of\r\nthe bill. And indeed it is quite certain that, unless this bill, or some\r\nsimilar bill, be passed, a new college will soon be founded and endowed\r\nwith that munificence of which the history of the Free Church furnishes\r\nso many examples. From the day on which such an university arises, the\r\nold universities must decline. Now, they are practically national, and\r\nnot sectarian, institutions. And yet, even now, the emoluments of a\r\nprofessorship are so much smaller than those which ability and industry\r\ncan obtain in other ways, that it is difficult to find eminent men to\r\nfill the chairs. And if there be this difficulty now, when students of\r\nall religious persuasions attend the lectures, what is likely to happen\r\nwhen all the members of the Free Church go elsewhere for instruction?\r\nIf there be this difficulty when you have all the world to choose\r\nprofessors from, what is likely to happen when your choice is narrowed\r\nto less than one-half of Scotland? As the professorships become poorer,\r\nthe professors will become less competent. As the professors become\r\nless competent, the classes will become thinner. As the classes become\r\nthinner, the professorships will again become poorer. The decline\r\nwill become rapid and headlong. In a short time, the lectures will be\r\ndelivered to empty rooms: the grass will grow in the courts: and men\r\nnot fit to be village dominies will occupy the chairs of Adam Smith and\r\nDugald Stewart, of Reid and Black, of Playfair and Jamieson.\r\n\r\nHow do Her Majesty's Ministers like such a prospect as this! Already\r\nthey have, whether by their fault or their misfortune I will not now\r\ninquire, secured for themselves an unenviable place in the history\r\nof Scotland. Their names are already inseparably associated with\r\nthe disruption of her Church. Are those names to be as inseparably\r\nassociated with the ruin of her Universities?\r\n\r\nIf the Government were consistent in error, some respect might be\r\nmingled with our disapprobation. But a Government which is guided by no\r\nprinciple; a Government which, on the gravest questions, does not know\r\nits own mind twenty-four hours together; a Government which is against\r\ntests at Cork, and for tests at Glasgow, against tests at Belfast, and\r\nfor tests at Edinburgh, against tests on the Monday, for them on the\r\nWednesday, against them again on the Thursday--how can such a Government\r\ncommand esteem or confidence? How can the Ministers wonder that their\r\nuncertain and capricious liberality fails to obtain the applause of\r\nthe liberal party? What right have they to complain if they lose the\r\nconfidence of half the nation without gaining the confidence of the\r\nother half?\r\n\r\nBut I do not speak to the Government. I speak to the House. I appeal\r\nto those who, on Monday last, voted with the Ministers against the test\r\nproposed by the honourable Baronet the Member for North Devon. I know\r\nwhat is due to party ties. But there is a mire so black and so deep\r\nthat no leader has a right to drag his followers through it. It is only\r\nforty-eight hours since honourable gentlemen were brought down to the\r\nHouse to vote against requiring the professors in the Irish Colleges to\r\nmake a declaration of belief in the Gospel: and now the same gentlemen\r\nare expected to come down and to vote that no man shall be a professor\r\nin a Scottish college who does not declare himself a Calvinist and a\r\nPresbyterian. Flagrant as is the injustice with which the ministers have\r\non this occasion treated Scotland, the injustice with which they have\r\ntreated their own supporters is more flagrant still. I call on all\r\nwho voted with the Government on Monday to consider whether they can\r\nconsistently and honourably vote with the Government to-night: I call on\r\nall members of the Church of England to ponder well before they make it\r\npenal to be a member of the Church of England; and, lastly, I call on\r\nevery man of every sect and party who loves science and letters, who is\r\nsolicitous for the public tranquillity, who respects the public faith,\r\nto stand by us in this our hard struggle to avert the ruin which\r\nthreatens the Universities of Scotland. I move that this bill be now\r\nread a second time.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORN LAWS. (DECEMBER 2, 1845) A SPEECH DELIVERED AT EDINBURGH ON THE 2D\r\nOF DECEMBER 1845.\r\n\r\nThe following Speech was delivered at a public meeting held at Edinburgh\r\non the second of December, 1845, for the purpose of petitioning Her\r\nMajesty to open the ports of the United Kingdom for the free admission\r\nof corn and other food.\r\n\r\nMy Lord Provost and Gentlemen,--You will, I hope, believe that I am\r\ndeeply sensible of the kindness with which you have received me. I only\r\nbeg that you will continue to extend your indulgence to me, if it should\r\nhappen that my voice should fail me in the attempt to address you. I\r\nhave thought it my duty to obey your summons, though I am hardly equal\r\nto the exertion of public speaking, and though I am so situated that I\r\ncan pass only a few hours among you. But it seemed to me that this was\r\nnot an ordinary meeting or an ordinary crisis. It seemed to me that\r\na great era had arrived, and that, at such a conjuncture, you were\r\nentitled to know the opinions and intentions of one who has the honour\r\nof being your representative.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the past, gentlemen, I have perhaps a little to explain,\r\nbut certainly nothing to repent or to retract. My opinions, from the\r\nday on which I entered public life, have never varied. I have always\r\nconsidered the principle of protection of agriculture as a vicious\r\nprinciple. I have always thought that this vicious principle took,\r\nin the Act of 1815, in the Act of 1828, and in the Act of 1842, a\r\nsingularly vicious form. This I declared twelve years ago, when I stood\r\nfor Leeds: this I declared in May 1839, when I first presented myself\r\nbefore you; and when, a few months later, Lord Melbourne invited me to\r\nbecome a member of his Government, I distinctly told him that, in office\r\nor out of office, I must vote for the total repeal of the corn laws.\r\n\r\nBut in the year 1841 a very peculiar crisis arrived. There was reason to\r\nhope that it might be possible to effect a compromise, which would not\r\nindeed wholly remove the evils inseparable from a system of protection,\r\nbut which would greatly mitigate them. There were some circumstances in\r\nthe financial situation of the country which led those who were then the\r\nadvisers of the Crown to hope that they might be able to get rid of\r\nthe sliding scale, and to substitute for it a moderate fixed duty. We\r\nproposed a duty of eight shillings a quarter on wheat. The Parliament\r\nrefused even to consider our plan. Her Majesty appealed to the people.\r\nI presented myself before you; and you will bear me witness that I\r\ndisguised nothing. I said, \"I am for a perfectly free trade in corn:\r\nbut I think that, situated as we are, we should do well to consent to a\r\ncompromise. If you return me to Parliament, I shall vote for the eight\r\nshilling duty. It is for you to determine whether, on those terms, you\r\nwill return me or not.\" You agreed with me. You sent me back to the\r\nHouse of Commons on the distinct understanding that I was to vote for\r\nthe plan proposed by the Government of which I was a member. As soon as\r\nthe new Parliament met, a change of administration took place. But it\r\nseemed to me that it was my duty to support, when out of place, that\r\nproposition to which I had been a party when I was in place. I therefore\r\ndid not think myself justified in voting for a perfectly free trade,\r\ntill Parliament had decided against our fixed duty, and in favour of\r\nSir Robert Peel's new sliding scale. As soon as that decision had been\r\npronounced, I conceived that I was no longer bound by the terms of the\r\ncompromise which I had, with many misgivings, consented to offer to the\r\nagriculturists, and which the agriculturists had refused to accept. I\r\nhave ever since voted in favour of every motion which has been made for\r\nthe total abolition of the duties on corn.\r\n\r\nThere has been, it is true, some difference of opinion between me and\r\nsome of you. We belonged to the same camp: but we did not quite agree\r\nas to the mode of carrying on the war. I saw the immense strength of the\r\ninterests which were arrayed against us. I saw that the corn monopoly\r\nwould last forever if those who defended it were united, while those who\r\nassailed it were divided. I saw that many men of distinguished abilities\r\nand patriotism, such men as Lord John Russell, Lord Howick, Lord\r\nMorpeth, were unwilling to relinquish all hope that the question might\r\nbe settled by a compromise such as had been proposed in 1841. It seemed\r\nto me that the help of such men was indispensable to us, and that, if\r\nwe drove from us such valuable allies, we should be unable to contend\r\nagainst the common enemy. Some of you thought that I was timorous, and\r\nothers that I was misled by party spirit or by personal friendship.\r\nI still think that I judged rightly. But I will not now argue the\r\nquestion. It has been set at rest for ever, and in the best possible\r\nway. It is not necessary for us to consider what relations we ought to\r\nmaintain with the party which is for a moderate fixed duty. That party\r\nhas disappeared. Time, and reflection, and discussion, have produced\r\ntheir natural effect on minds eminently intelligent and candid. No\r\nintermediate shades of opinion are now left. There is no twilight. The\r\nlight has been divided from the darkness. Two parties are ranged in\r\nbattle array against each other. There is the standard of monopoly.\r\nHere is the standard of free trade; and by the standard of free trade I\r\npledge myself to stand firmly.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, a resolution has been put into my hands which I shall move\r\nwith the greatest pleasure. That resolution sets forth in emphatic\r\nlanguage a truth of the highest importance, namely, that the present\r\ncorn laws press with especial severity on the poor. There was a time,\r\ngentlemen, when politicians were not ashamed to defend the corn laws\r\nmerely as contrivances for putting the money of the many into the\r\npockets of the few. We must,--so these men reasoned,--have a powerful\r\nand opulent class of grandees: that we may have such grandees, the rent\r\nof land must be kept up: and that the rent of land may be kept up, the\r\nprice of bread must be kept up. There may still be people who think\r\nthus: but they wisely keep their thoughts to themselves. Nobody now\r\nventures to say in public that ten thousand families ought to be put on\r\nshort allowance of food in order that one man may have a fine stud and\r\na fine picture gallery. Our monopolists have changed their ground.\r\nThey have abandoned their old argument for a new argument much\r\nless invidious, but, I think, rather more absurd. They have turned\r\nphilanthropists. Their hearts bleed for the misery of the poor labouring\r\nman. They constantly tell us that the cry against the corn laws has been\r\nraised by capitalists; that the capitalist wishes to enrich himself at\r\nthe expense both of the landed gentry and of the working people; that\r\nevery reduction of the price of food must be followed by a reduction of\r\nthe wages of labour; and that, if bread should cost only half what it\r\nnow costs, the peasant and the artisan would be sunk in wretchedness and\r\ndegradation, and the only gainers would be the millowners and the money\r\nchangers. It is not only by landowners, it is not only by Tories, that\r\nthis nonsense has been talked. We have heard it from men of a very\r\ndifferent class, from demagogues who wish to keep up the corn laws,\r\nmerely in order that the corn laws may make the people miserable, and\r\nthat misery may make the people turbulent. You know how assiduously\r\nthose enemies of all order and all property have laboured to deceive the\r\nworking man into a belief that cheap bread would be a curse to him. Nor\r\nhave they always laboured in vain. You remember that once, even in this\r\ngreat and enlightened city, a public meeting called to consider the corn\r\nlaws was disturbed by a deluded populace. Now, for my own part, whenever\r\nI hear bigots who are opposed to all reform, and anarchists who are bent\r\non universal destruction, join in the same cry, I feel certain that it\r\nis an absurd and mischievous cry; and surely never was there a cry\r\nso absurd and mischievous as this cry against cheap loaves. It seems\r\nstrange that Conservatives, people who profess to hold new theories\r\nin abhorrence, people who are always talking about the wisdom of our\r\nancestors, should insist on our receiving as an undoubted truth a\r\nstrange paradox never heard of from the creation of the world till the\r\nnineteenth century. Begin with the most ancient book extant, the Book of\r\nGenesis, and come down to the parliamentary debates of 1815; and I will\r\nventure to say that you will find that, on this point, the party which\r\naffects profound reverence for antiquity and prescription has against it\r\nthe unanimous voice of thirty-three centuries. If there be anything\r\nin which all peoples, nations, and languages, Jews, Greeks, Romans,\r\nItalians, Frenchmen, Englishmen, have agreed, it has been this, that\r\nthe dearness of food is a great evil to the poor. Surely, the arguments\r\nwhich are to counterbalance such a mass of authority ought to be\r\nweighty. What then are those arguments? I know of only one. If any\r\ngentleman is acquainted with any other, I wish that he would communicate\r\nit to us; and I will engage that he shall have a fair and full hearing.\r\nThe only argument that I know of is this, that there are some countries\r\nin the world where food is cheaper than in England, and where the people\r\nare more miserable than in England. Bengal has been mentioned. But\r\nPoland is the favourite case. Whenever we ask why there should not be\r\na free trade in corn between the Vistula and the Thames, the answer\r\nis, \"Do you wish our labourers to be reduced to the condition of the\r\npeasants of the Vistula?\" Was such reasoning ever heard before? See how\r\nreadily it may be turned against those who use it. Corn is cheaper at\r\nCincinnati than here; but the wages of the labourer are much higher at\r\nCincinnati than here: therefore, the lower the price of food, the higher\r\nthe wages will be. This reasoning is just as good as the reasoning of\r\nour adversaries: that is to say, it is good for nothing. It is not\r\none single cause that makes nations either prosperous or miserable. No\r\nfriend of free trade is such an idiot as to say that free trade is the\r\nonly valuable thing in the world; that religion, government, police,\r\neducation, the administration of justice, public expenditure, foreign\r\nrelations, have nothing whatever to do with the well-being of nations;\r\nthat people sunk in superstition, slavery, barbarism, must be happy if\r\nthey have only cheap food. These gentlemen take the most unfortunate\r\ncountry in the world, a country which, while it had an independent\r\ngovernment, had the very worst of independent governments; the sovereign\r\na mere phantom; the nobles defying him and quarrelling with each other;\r\nthe great body of the population in a state of servitude; no middle\r\nclass; no manufactures; scarcely any trade, and that in the hands of Jew\r\npedlars. Such was Poland while it was a separate kingdom. But foreign\r\ninvaders came down upon it. It was conquered: it was reconquered: it was\r\npartitioned: it was repartitioned: it is now under a government of which\r\nI will not trust myself to speak. This is the country to which these\r\ngentlemen go to study the effect of low prices. When they wish to\r\nascertain the effect of high prices, they take our own country; a\r\ncountry which has been during many generations the best governed in\r\nEurope; a country where personal slavery has been unknown during ages;\r\na country which enjoys the blessings of a pure religion, of freedom, of\r\norder; a country long secured by the sea against invasion; a country in\r\nwhich the oldest man living has never seen a foreign flag except as a\r\ntrophy. Between these two countries our political philosophers institute\r\na comparison. They find the Briton better off than the Pole; and they\r\nimmediately come to the conclusion that the Briton is so well off\r\nbecause his bread is dear, and the Pole so ill off because his bread is\r\ncheap. Why, is there a single good which in this way I could not prove\r\nto be an evil, or a single evil which I could not prove to be a good?\r\nTake lameness. I will prove that it is the best thing in the world to\r\nbe lame: for I can show you men who are lame, and yet much happier than\r\nmany men who have the full use of their legs. I will prove health to be\r\na calamity. For I can easily find you people in excellent health whose\r\nfortunes have been wrecked, whose character has been blasted, and who\r\nare more wretched than many invalids. But is that the way in which any\r\nman of common sense reasons? No; the question is: Would not the lame man\r\nbe happier if you restored to him the use of his limbs? Would not the\r\nhealthy man be more wretched if he had gout and rheumatism in addition\r\nto all his other calamities? Would not the Englishman be better off\r\nif food were as cheap here as in Poland? Would not the Pole be more\r\nmiserable if food were as dear in Poland as here? More miserable indeed\r\nhe would not long be: for he would be dead in a month.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the true way of determining the question which we\r\nare considering, is to compare the state of a society when food is cheap\r\nwith the state of that same society when food is dear; and this is a\r\ncomparison which we can very easily make. We have only to recall to our\r\nmemory what we have ourselves seen within the last ten years. Take the\r\nyear 1835. Food was cheap then; and the capitalist prospered greatly.\r\nBut was the labouring man miserable? On the contrary, it is notorious\r\nthat work was plentiful, that wages were high, that the common people\r\nwere thriving and contented. Then came a change like that in Pharaoh's\r\ndream. The thin ears had blighted the full ears; the lean kine had\r\ndevoured the fat kine; the days of plenty were over; and the days of\r\ndearth had arrived. In 1841 the capitalist was doubtless distressed. But\r\nwill anybody tell me that the capitalist was the only sufferer, or the\r\nchief sufferer? Have we forgotten what was the condition of the\r\nworking people in that unhappy year? So visible was the misery of the\r\nmanufacturing towns that a man of sensibility could hardly bear to pass\r\nthrough them. Everywhere he found filth and nakedness, and plaintive\r\nvoices, and wasted forms, and haggard faces. Politicians who had never\r\nbeen thought alarmists began to tremble for the very foundations of\r\nsociety. First the mills were put on short time. Then they ceased to\r\nwork at all. Then went to pledge the scanty property of the artisan:\r\nfirst his little luxuries, then his comforts, then his necessaries. The\r\nhovels were stripped till they were as bare as the wigwam of a Dogribbed\r\nIndian. Alone, amidst the general misery, the shop with the three golden\r\nballs prospered, and was crammed from cellar to garret with the clocks,\r\nand the tables, and the kettles, and the blankets, and the bibles of\r\nthe poor. I remember well the effect which was produced in London by the\r\nunwonted sight of the huge pieces of cannon which were going northward\r\nto overawe the starving population of Lancashire. These evil days passed\r\naway. Since that time we have again had cheap bread. The capitalist has\r\nbeen a gainer. It was fit that he should be a gainer. But has he been\r\nthe only gainer? Will those who are always telling us that the Polish\r\nlabourer is worse off than the English labourer venture to tell us that\r\nthe English labourer was worse off in 1844 than in 1841? Have we not\r\neverywhere seen the goods of the poor coming back from the magazine of\r\nthe pawnbroker? Have we not seen in the house of the working man, in his\r\nclothing, in his very looks as he passed us in the streets, that he\r\nwas a happier being? As to his pleasures, and especially as to the\r\nmost innocent, the most salutary, of his pleasures, ask your own most\r\nintelligent and useful fellow citizen Mr Robert Chambers what sale\r\npopular books had in the year 1841, and what sale they had last year.\r\nI am assured that, in one week of 1845, the sums paid in wages within\r\ntwenty miles of Manchester exceeded by a million and a half the sums\r\npaid in the corresponding week of 1841.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, both the capitalist and the labourer have been gainers,\r\nas they ought to have been gainers, by the diminution in the price of\r\nbread. But there is a third party, which ought not to have gained by\r\nthat diminution, and yet has gained very greatly by it; and that party\r\nis Her Majesty's present Government. It is for the interest of rulers\r\nthat those whom they rule should be prosperous. But the prosperity which\r\nwe have lately enjoyed was a prosperity for which we were not indebted\r\nto our rulers. It came in spite of them. It was produced by the\r\ncheapness of that which they had laboured to render dear. Under pretence\r\nof making us independent of foreign supply, they have established a\r\nsystem which makes us dependent in the worst possible way. As my valued\r\nfriend, the Lord Provost (Mr Adam Black.), has justly said, there is\r\na mutual dependence among nations of which we cannot get rid. That\r\nProvidence has assigned different productions to different climates is a\r\ntruth with which everybody is familiar. But this is not all. Even in\r\nthe same climate different productions belong to different stages of\r\ncivilisation. As one latitude is favourable to the vine and another to\r\nthe sugar cane, so there is, in the same latitude, a state of society in\r\nwhich it is desirable that the industry of men should be almost entirely\r\ndirected towards the cultivation of the earth, and another state of\r\nsociety in which it is desirable that a large part of the population\r\nshould be employed in manufactures. No dependence can be conceived more\r\nnatural, more salutary, more free from everything like degradation\r\nthan the mutual dependence which exists between a nation which has a\r\nboundless extent of fertile land, and a nation which has a boundless\r\ncommand of machinery; between a nation whose business is to turn deserts\r\ninto corn fields, and a nation whose business is to increase tenfold by\r\ningenious processes the value of the fleece and of the rude iron ore.\r\nEven if that dependence were less beneficial than it is, we must\r\nsubmit to it; for it is inevitable. Make what laws we will, we must be\r\ndependent on other countries for a large part of our food. That point\r\nwas decided when England ceased to be an exporting country. For,\r\ngentlemen, it is demonstrable that none but a country which ordinarily\r\nexports food can be independent of foreign supplies. If a manufacturer\r\ndetermines to produce ten thousand pair of stockings, he will produce\r\nthe ten thousand, and neither more nor less. But an agriculturist\r\ncannot determine that he will produce ten thousand quarters of corn,\r\nand neither more nor less. That he may be sure of having ten thousand\r\nquarters in a bad year, he must sow such a quantity of land that he will\r\nhave much more than ten thousand in a good year. It is evident that, if\r\nour island does not in ordinary years produce many more quarters than we\r\nwant, it will in bad years produce fewer quarters than we want. And it\r\nis equally evident that our cultivators will not produce more quarters\r\nof corn than we want, unless they can export the surplus at a profit.\r\nNobody ventures to tell us that Great Britain can be ordinarily an\r\nexporting country. It follows that we must be dependent: and the only\r\nquestion is, Which is the best mode of dependence? That question it is\r\nnot difficult to answer. Go to Lancashire; see that multitude of cities,\r\nsome of them equal in size to the capitals of large kingdoms. Look at\r\nthe warehouses, the machinery, the canals, the railways, the docks.\r\nSee the stir of that hive of human beings busily employed in making,\r\npacking, conveying stuffs which are to be worn in Canada and Caffraria,\r\nin Chili and Java. You naturally ask, How is this immense population,\r\ncollected on an area which will not yield food for one tenth part of\r\nthem, to be nourished? But change the scene. Go beyond the Ohio, and\r\nthere you will see another species of industry, equally extensive and\r\nequally flourishing. You will see the wilderness receding fast before\r\nthe advancing tide of life and civilisation, vast harvests waving round\r\nthe black stumps of what a few months ago was a pathless forest, and\r\ncottages, barns, mills, rising amidst the haunts of the wolf and the\r\nbear. Here is more than enough corn to feed the artisans of our thickly\r\npeopled island; and most gladly would the grower of that corn exchange\r\nit for a Sheffield knife, a Birmingham spoon, a warm coat of Leeds\r\nwoollen cloth, a light dress of Manchester cotton. But this exchange our\r\nrulers prohibit. They say to our manufacturing population, \"You would\r\nwillingly weave clothes for the people of America, and they would gladly\r\nsow wheat for you; but we prohibit this intercourse. We condemn both\r\nyour looms and their ploughs to inaction. We will compel you to pay a\r\nhigh price for a stinted meal. We will compel those who would gladly be\r\nyour purveyors and your customers to be your rivals. We will compel them\r\nto turn manufacturers in self-defence; and when, in close imitation of\r\nus, they impose high duties on British goods for the protection of their\r\nown produce, we will, in our speeches and despatches, express wonder and\r\npity at their strange ignorance of political economy.\"\r\n\r\nSuch has been the policy of Her Majesty's Ministers; but it has not yet\r\nbeen fairly brought to the trial. Good harvests have prevented bad laws\r\nfrom producing their full effect. The Government has had a run of luck;\r\nand vulgar observers have mistaken luck for wisdom. But such runs of\r\nluck do not last forever. Providence will not always send the rain and\r\nthe sunshine just at such a time and in such a quantity as to save\r\nthe reputation of shortsighted statesmen. There is too much reason to\r\nbelieve that evil days are approaching. On such a subject it is a\r\nsacred duty to avoid exaggeration; and I shall do so. I observe that\r\nthe writers,--wretched writers they are,--who defend the present\r\nAdministration, assert that there is no probability of a considerable\r\nrise in the price of provisions, and that the Whigs and the\r\nAnti-Corn-Law League are busily engaged in circulating false reports for\r\nthe vile purpose of raising a panic. Now, gentlemen, it shall not be\r\nin the power of anybody to throw any such imputation on me; for I shall\r\ndescribe our prospects in the words of the Ministers themselves. I\r\nhold in my hand a letter in which Sir Thomas Freemantle, Secretary for\r\nIreland, asks for information touching the potato crop in that country.\r\nHis words are these. \"Her Majesty's Government is seeking to learn the\r\nopinion of judges and well informed persons in every part of Ireland\r\nregarding the probability of the supply being sufficient for the support\r\nof the people during the ensuing winter and spring, provided care be\r\ntaken in preserving the stock, and economy used in its consumption.\"\r\nHere, you will observe, it is taken for granted that the supply is\r\nnot sufficient for a year's consumption: it is taken for granted that,\r\nwithout care and economy, the supply will not last to the end of the\r\nspring; and a doubt is expressed whether, with care and economy, the\r\nsupply will last even through the winter. In this letter the Ministers\r\nof the Crown tell us that famine is close at hand; and yet, when this\r\nletter was written, the duty on foreign corn was seventeen shillings\r\na quarter. Is it necessary to say more about the merits of the sliding\r\nscale? We were assured that this wonderful piece of machinery would\r\nsecure us against all danger of scarcity. But unhappily we find that\r\nthere is a hitch; the sliding scale will not slide; the Ministers are\r\ncrying \"Famine,\" while the index which they themselves devised is still\r\npointing to \"Plenty.\"\r\n\r\nAnd thus, Sir, I come back to the resolution which I hold in my hand, A\r\ndear year is before us. The price of meal is already, I believe, half as\r\nmuch again as it was a few months ago. Again, unhappily, we are able\r\nto bring to the test of facts the doctrine, that the dearness of food\r\nbenefits the labourer and injures only the capitalist. The price of\r\nfood is rising. Are wages rising? On the contrary, they are falling. In\r\nnumerous districts the symptoms of distress are already perceptible.\r\nThe manufacturers are already beginning to work short time. Warned by\r\nrepeated experience, they know well what is coming, and expect that 1846\r\nwill be a second 1841.\r\n\r\nIf these things do not teach us wisdom, we are past all teaching. Twice\r\nin ten years we have seen the price of corn go up; and, as it went up,\r\nthe wages of the labouring classes went down. Twice in the same period\r\nwe have seen the price of corn go down; and, as it went down, the wages\r\nof the labouring classes went up. Surely such experiments as these would\r\nin any science be considered as decisive.\r\n\r\nThe prospect, gentlemen, is, doubtless, gloomy. Yet it has its bright\r\npart. I have already congratulated you on the important fact that\r\nLord John Russell and those who have hitherto acted on this subject in\r\nconcert with him, have given up all thoughts of fixed duty. I have to\r\ncongratulate you on another fact not less important. I am assured that\r\nthe working people of the manufacturing districts have at last come to\r\nunderstand this question. The sharp discipline which they have undergone\r\nhas produced this good effect; that they will never again listen to any\r\norator who shall have the effrontery to tell them that their wages rise\r\nand fall with the price of the loaf. Thus we shall go into the contest\r\nunder such leading and with such a following as we never had before. The\r\nbest part of the aristocracy will be at our head. Millions of labouring\r\nmen, who had been separated from us by the arts of impostors, will be\r\nin our rear. So led and so followed, we may, I think, look forward to\r\nvictory, if not in this, yet in the next Parliament. But, whether our\r\ntriumph be near or remote, I assure you that I shall not fail as regards\r\nthis question, to prove myself your true representative. I will now, my\r\nLord, put into your hands this resolution, \"That the present corn law\r\npresses with especial severity on the poorer classes.\"\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TEN HOURS BILL. (MAY 22, 1846) A SPEECH DELIVERED IN THE HOUSE OF\r\nCOMMONS ON THE 22D OF MAY 1846.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-ninth of April, 1846, Mr Fielden, Member for Oldham, moved\r\nthe second reading of a Bill for limiting the labour of young persons\r\nin factories to ten hours a day. The debate was adjourned, and was\r\nrepeatedly resumed at long intervals. At length, on the twenty-second of\r\nMay the Bill was rejected by 203 votes to 193. On that day the following\r\nSpeech was made.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, Sir, that I can remain silent after the appeal which\r\nhas been made to me in so pointed a manner by my honourable friend, the\r\nMember for Sheffield (Mr Ward.), and even if that appeal had not been\r\nmade to me, I should have been very desirous to have an opportunity of\r\nexplaining the grounds on which I shall vote for the second reading of\r\nthis bill.\r\n\r\nIt is, I hope, unnecessary for me to assure my honourable friend that\r\nI utterly disapprove of those aspersions which have, both in this House\r\nand out of it, been thrown on the owners of factories. For that valuable\r\nclass of men I have no feeling but respect and good will. I am convinced\r\nthat with their interests the interests of the whole community, and\r\nespecially of the labouring classes, are inseparably bound up. I can\r\nalso with perfect sincerity declare that the vote which I shall give\r\nto-night will not be a factious vote. In no circumstances indeed should\r\nI think that the laws of political hostility warranted me in treating\r\nthis question as a party question. But at the present moment I would\r\nmuch rather strengthen than weaken the hands of Her Majesty's Ministers.\r\nIt is by no means pleasant to me to be under the necessity of opposing\r\nthem. I assure them, I assure my friends on this side of the House with\r\nwhom I am so unfortunate as to differ, and especially my honourable\r\nfriend the Member for Sheffield, who spoke, I must say, in rather too\r\nplaintive a tone, that I have no desire to obtain credit for humanity at\r\ntheir expense. I fully believe that their feeling towards the labouring\r\npeople is quite as kind as mine. There is no difference between us as\r\nto ends: there is an honest difference of opinion as to means: and we\r\nsurely ought to be able to discuss the points on which we differ without\r\none angry emotion or one acrimonious word.\r\n\r\nThe details of the bill, Sir, will be more conveniently and more\r\nregularly discussed when we consider it in Committee. Our business at\r\npresent is with the principle: and the principle, we are told by many\r\ngentlemen of great authority, is unsound. In their opinion, neither\r\nthis bill, nor any other bill regulating the hours of labour, can be\r\ndefended. This, they say, is one of those matters about which we ought\r\nnot to legislate at all; one of those matters which settle themselves\r\nfar better than any government can settle them. Now it is most important\r\nthat this point should be fully cleared up. We certainly ought not to\r\nusurp functions which do not properly belong to us: but, on the other\r\nhand, we ought not to abdicate functions which do properly belong to\r\nus. I hardly know which is the greater pest to society, a paternal\r\ngovernment, that is to say a prying, meddlesome government, which\r\nintrudes itself into every part of human life, and which thinks that it\r\ncan do everything for everybody better than anybody can do anything for\r\nhimself; or a careless, lounging government, which suffers grievances,\r\nsuch as it could at once remove, to grow and multiply, and which to\r\nall complaint and remonstrance has only one answer: \"We must let things\r\nalone: we must let things take their course: we must let things find\r\ntheir level.\" There is no more important problem in politics than to\r\nascertain the just mean between these two most pernicious extremes, to\r\ndraw correctly the line which divides those cases in which it is the\r\nduty of the State to interfere from those cases in which it is the duty\r\nof the State to abstain from interference. In old times the besetting\r\nsin of rulers was undoubtedly an inordinate disposition to meddle. The\r\nlawgiver was always telling people how to keep their shops, how to till\r\ntheir fields, how to educate their children, how many dishes to have\r\non their tables, how much a yard to give for the cloth which made their\r\ncoats. He was always trying to remedy some evil which did not properly\r\nfall within his province: and the consequence was that he increased\r\nthe evils which he attempted to remedy. He was so much shocked by\r\nthe distress inseparable from scarcity that he made statutes against\r\nforestalling and regrating, and so turned the scarcity into a famine. He\r\nwas so much shocked by the cunning and hardheartedness of money-lenders\r\nthat he made laws against usury; and the consequence was that the\r\nborrower, who, if he had been left unprotected, would have got money at\r\nten per cent., could hardly, when protected, get it at fifteen per cent.\r\nSome eminent political philosophers of the last century exposed with\r\ngreat ability the folly of such legislation, and, by doing so, rendered\r\na great service to mankind. There has been a reaction, a reaction which\r\nhas doubtless produced much good, but which like most reactions, has not\r\nbeen without evils and dangers. Our statesmen cannot now be accused of\r\nbeing busybodies. But I am afraid that there is, even in some of the\r\nablest and most upright among them a tendency to the opposite fault.\r\nI will give an instance of what I mean. Fifteen years ago it became\r\nevident that railroads would soon, in every part of the kingdom,\r\nsupersede to a great extent the old highways. The tracing of the\r\nnew routes which were to join all the chief cities, ports, and naval\r\narsenals of the island was a matter of the highest national importance.\r\nBut, unfortunately, those who should have acted for the nation, refused\r\nto interfere. Consequently, numerous questions which were really public,\r\nquestions which concerned the public convenience, the public prosperity,\r\nthe public security, were treated as private questions. That the whole\r\nsociety was interested in having a good system of internal communication\r\nseemed to be forgotten. The speculator who wanted a large dividend\r\non his shares, the landowner who wanted a large price for his acres,\r\nobtained a full hearing. But nobody applied to be heard on behalf of\r\nthe community. The effects of that great error we feel, and we shall not\r\nsoon cease to feel. Unless I am greatly mistaken, we are in danger of\r\ncommitting to-night an error of the same kind. The honourable member for\r\nMontrose (Mr Hume.) and my honourable friend the Member for Sheffield\r\nthink that the question before us is merely a question between the old\r\nand the new theories of commerce. They cannot understand how any\r\nfriend of free trade can wish the Legislature to interfere between the\r\ncapitalist and the labourer. They say, \"You do not make a law to settle\r\nthe price of gloves, or the texture of gloves, or the length of credit\r\nwhich the glover shall give. You leave it to him to determine whether\r\nhe will charge high or low prices, whether he will use strong or\r\nflimsy materials, whether he will trust or insist on ready money. You\r\nacknowledge that these are matters which he ought to be left to settle\r\nwith his customers, and that we ought not to interfere. It is possible\r\nthat he may manage his shop ill. But it is certain that we shall manage\r\nit ill. On the same grounds on which you leave the seller of gloves and\r\nthe buyer of gloves to make their own contract, you ought to leave the\r\nseller of labour and the buyer of labour to make their own contract.\"\r\n\r\nI have a great respect, Sir, for those who reason thus: but I cannot see\r\nthis matter in the light in which it appears to them; and, though I may\r\ndistrust my own judgment, I must be guided by it. I am, I believe, as\r\nstrongly attached as any member of this House to the principle of free\r\ntrade, rightly understood. Trade, considered merely as trade, considered\r\nmerely with reference to the pecuniary interest of the contracting\r\nparties, can hardly be too free. But there is a great deal of trade\r\nwhich cannot be considered merely as trade, and which affects higher\r\nthan pecuniary interests. And to say that Government never ought to\r\nregulate such trade is a monstrous proposition, a proposition at which\r\nAdam Smith would have stood aghast. We impose some restrictions on trade\r\nfor purposes of police. Thus, we do not suffer everybody who has a cab\r\nand a horse to ply for passengers in the streets of London. We do not\r\nleave the fare to be determined by the supply and the demand. We do not\r\npermit a driver to extort a guinea for going half a mile on a rainy day\r\nwhen there is no other vehicle on the stand. We impose some restrictions\r\non trade for the sake of revenue. Thus, we forbid a farmer to cultivate\r\ntobacco on his own ground. We impose some restrictions on trade for\r\nthe sake of national defence. Thus we compel a man who would rather be\r\nploughing or weaving to go into the militia; and we fix the amount of\r\npay which he shall receive without asking his consent. Nor is there in\r\nall this anything inconsistent with the soundest political economy. For\r\nthe science of political economy teaches us only that we ought not on\r\ncommercial grounds to interfere with the liberty of commerce; and we,\r\nin the cases which I have put, interfere with the liberty of commerce on\r\nhigher than commercial grounds.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Sir, to come closer to the case with which we have to deal, I\r\nsay, first, that where the health of the community is concerned, it may\r\nbe the duty of the State to interfere with the contracts of individuals;\r\nand to this proposition I am quite sure that Her Majesty's Government\r\nwill cordially assent. I have just read a very interesting report signed\r\nby two members of that Government, the Duke of Buccleuch, and the noble\r\nearl who was lately Chief Commissioner of the Woods and Forests, and\r\nwho is now Secretary for Ireland (The Earl of Lincoln.); and, since that\r\nreport was laid before the House, the noble earl himself has, with the\r\nsanction of the Cabinet, brought in a bill for the protection of\r\nthe public health. By this bill it is provided that no man shall be\r\npermitted to build a house on his own land in any great town without\r\ngiving notice to certain Commissioners. No man is to sink a cellar\r\nwithout the consent of these Commissioners. The house must not be of\r\nless than a prescribed width. No new house must be built without a\r\ndrain. If an old house has no drain, the Commissioners may order the\r\nowner to make a drain. If he refuses, they make a drain for him, and\r\nsend him in the bill. They may order him to whitewash his house. If he\r\nrefuses, they may send people with pails and brushes to whitewash it for\r\nhim, at his charge. Now, suppose that some proprietor of houses at Leeds\r\nor Manchester were to expostulate with the Government in the language in\r\nwhich the Government has expostulated with the supporters of this bill\r\nfor the regulation of factories. Suppose he were to say to the noble\r\nearl, \"Your lordship professes to be a friend to free trade. Your\r\nlordship's doctrine is that everybody ought to be at liberty to buy\r\ncheap and to sell dear. Why then may not I run up a house as cheap as\r\nI can, and let my rooms as dear as I can? Your lordship does not like\r\nhouses without drains. Do not take one of mine then. You think my\r\nbedrooms filthy. Nobody forces you to sleep in them. Use your own\r\nliberty: but do not restrain that of your neighbours. I can find many\r\na family willing to pay a shilling a week for leave to live in what\r\nyou call a hovel. And why am not I to take the shilling which they are\r\nwilling to give me? And why are not they to have such shelter as, for\r\nthat shilling, I can afford them? Why did you send a man without my\r\nconsent to clean my house, and then force me to pay for what I never\r\nordered? My tenants thought the house clean enough for them; or they\r\nwould not have been my tenants; and, if they and I were satisfied,\r\nwhy did you, in direct defiance of all the principles of free trade,\r\ninterfere between us?\" This reasoning, Sir, is exactly of a piece\r\nwith the reasoning of the honourable Member for Montrose, and of my\r\nhonourable friend the Member for Sheffield. If the noble earl will\r\nallow me to make a defence for him, I believe that he would answer the\r\nobjection thus: \"I hold,\" he would say, \"the sound doctrine of free\r\ntrade. But your doctrine of free trade is an exaggeration, a caricature\r\nof the sound doctrine; and by exhibiting such a caricature you bring\r\ndiscredit on the sound doctrine. We should have nothing to do with the\r\ncontracts between you and your tenants, if those contracts affected only\r\npecuniary interests. But higher than pecuniary interests are at stake.\r\nIt concerns the commonwealth that the great body of the people should\r\nnot live in a way which makes life wretched and short, which enfeebles\r\nthe body and pollutes the mind. If, by living in houses which resemble\r\nhogstyes, great numbers of our countrymen have contracted the tastes\r\nof hogs, if they have become so familiar with filth and stench and\r\ncontagion, that they burrow without reluctance in holes which would turn\r\nthe stomach of any man of cleanly habits, that is only an additional\r\nproof that we have too long neglected our duties, and an additional\r\nreason for our now performing them.\"\r\n\r\nSecondly, I say that where the public morality is concerned it may be\r\nthe duty of the State to interfere with the contracts of individuals.\r\nTake the traffic in licentious books and pictures. Will anybody deny\r\nthat the State may, with propriety, interdict that traffic? Or take the\r\ncase of lotteries. I have, we will suppose, an estate for which I\r\nwish to get twenty thousand pounds. I announce my intention to issue a\r\nthousand tickets at twenty pounds each. The holder of the number which\r\nis first drawn is to have the estate. But the magistrate interferes; the\r\ncontract between me and the purchasers of my tickets is annulled; and\r\nI am forced to pay a heavy penalty for having made such a contract. I\r\nappeal to the principle of free trade, as expounded by the honourable\r\ngentlemen the Members for Montrose and Sheffield. I say to you, the\r\nlegislators who have restricted my liberty, \"What business have you to\r\ninterfere between a buyer and a seller? If you think the speculation\r\na bad one, do not take tickets. But do not interdict other people from\r\njudging for themselves.\" Surely you would answer, \"You would be right if\r\nthis were a mere question of trade: but it is a question of morality.\r\nWe prohibit you from disposing of your property in this particular mode,\r\nbecause it is a mode which tends to encourage a most pernicious habit of\r\nmind, a habit of mind incompatible with all the qualities on which the\r\nwell-being of individuals and of nations depends.\"\r\n\r\nIt must then, I think, be admitted that, where health is concerned, and\r\nwhere morality is concerned, the State is justified in interfering with\r\nthe contracts of individuals. And, if this be admitted, it follows that\r\nthe case with which we now have to do is a case for interference.\r\n\r\nWill it be denied that the health of a large part of the rising\r\ngeneration may be seriously affected by the contracts which this bill\r\nis intended to regulate? Can any man who has read the evidence which is\r\nbefore us, can any man who has ever observed young people, can any man\r\nwho remembers his own sensations when he was young, doubt that twelve\r\nhours a day of labour in a factory is too much for a lad of thirteen?\r\n\r\nOr will it be denied that this is a question in which public morality is\r\nconcerned? Can any one doubt,--none, I am sure, of my friends around\r\nme doubts,--that education is a matter of the highest importance to\r\nthe virtue and happiness of a people? Now we know that there can be no\r\neducation without leisure. It is evident that, after deducting from\r\nthe day twelve hours for labour in a factory, and the additional hours\r\nnecessary for exercise, refreshment, and repose, there will not remain\r\ntime enough for education.\r\n\r\nI have now, I think, shown that this bill is not in principle\r\nobjectionable; and yet I have not touched the strongest part of our\r\ncase. I hold that, where public health is concerned, and where public\r\nmorality is concerned, the State may be justified in regulating even the\r\ncontracts of adults. But we propose to regulate only the contracts of\r\ninfants. Now, was there ever a civilised society in which the contracts\r\nof infants were not under some regulation? Is there a single member of\r\nthis House who will say that a wealthy minor of thirteen ought to be at\r\nperfect liberty to execute a conveyance of his estate, or to give a bond\r\nfor fifty thousand pounds? If anybody were so absurd as to say, \"What\r\nhas the Legislature to do with the matter? Why cannot you leave trade\r\nfree? Why do you pretend to understand the boy's interest better than he\r\nunderstands it?\"--you would answer; \"When he grows up, he may squander\r\nhis fortune away if he likes: but at present the State is his guardian;\r\nand he shall not ruin himself till he is old enough to know what he\r\nis about.\" The minors whom we wish to protect have not indeed large\r\nproperty to throw away: but they are not the less our wards. Their only\r\ninheritance, the only fund to which they must look for their subsistence\r\nthrough life, is the sound mind in the sound body. And is it not our\r\nduty to prevent them from wasting their most precious wealth before they\r\nknow its value?\r\n\r\nBut, it is said, this bill, though it directly limits only the labour\r\nof infants, will, by an indirect operation, limit also the labour of\r\nadults. Now, Sir, though I am not prepared to vote for a bill directly\r\nlimiting the labour of adults, I will plainly say that I do not think\r\nthat the limitation of the labour of adults would necessarily produce\r\nall those frightful consequences which we have heard predicted. You\r\ncheer me in very triumphant tones, as if I had uttered some monstrous\r\nparadox. Pray, does it not occur to any of you that the labour of adults\r\nis now limited in this country? Are you not aware that you are living in\r\na society in which the labour of adults is limited to six days in seven?\r\nIt is you, not I, who maintain a paradox opposed to the opinions and\r\nthe practices of all nations and ages. Did you ever hear of a single\r\ncivilised State since the beginning of the world in which a certain\r\nportion of time was not set apart for the rest and recreation of adults\r\nby public authority? In general, this arrangement has been sanctioned\r\nby religion. The Egyptians, the Jews, the Greeks, the Romans, had their\r\nholidays: the Hindoo has his holidays: the Mussulman has his holidays:\r\nthere are holidays in the Greek Church, holidays in the Church of Rome,\r\nholidays in the Church of England. Is it not amusing to hear a gentleman\r\npronounce with confidence that any legislation which limits the labour\r\nof adults must produce consequences fatal to society, without once\r\nreflecting that in the society in which he lives, and in every\r\nother society that exists, or ever has existed, there has been such\r\nlegislation without any evil consequence? It is true that a Puritan\r\nGovernment in England, and an Atheistical Government in France,\r\nabolished the old holidays as superstitious. But those Governments felt\r\nit to be absolutely necessary to institute new holidays. Civil festivals\r\nwere substituted for religious festivals. You will find among the\r\nordinances of the Long Parliament a law providing that, in exchange for\r\nthe days of rest and amusement which the people had been used to enjoy\r\nat Easter, Whitsuntide, and Christmas, the second Tuesday in every month\r\nshould be given to the working man, and that any apprentice who was\r\nforced to work on the second Tuesday of any month might have his master\r\nup before a magistrate. The French Jacobins decreed that the Sunday\r\nshould no longer be a day of rest; but they instituted another day of\r\nrest, the Decade. They swept away the holidays of the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch; but they instituted another set of holidays, the Sansculottides,\r\none sacred to Genius, one to Industry, one to Opinion, and so on. I say,\r\ntherefore, that the practice of limiting by law the time of the labour\r\nof adults is so far from being, as some gentlemen seem to think, an\r\nunheard of and monstrous practice, that it is a practice as universal as\r\ncookery, as the wearing of clothes, as the use of domestic animals.\r\n\r\nAnd has this practice been proved by experience to be pernicious? Let us\r\ntake the instance with which we are most familiar. Let us inquire what\r\nhas been the effect of those laws which, in our own country, limit the\r\nlabour of adults to six days in every seven. It is quite unnecessary to\r\ndiscuss the question whether Christians be or be not bound by a divine\r\ncommand to observe the Sunday. For it is evident that, whether our\r\nweekly holiday be of divine or of human institution, the effect on the\r\ntemporal interests of Society will be exactly the same. Now, is there a\r\nsingle argument in the whole Speech of my honourable friend the Member\r\nfor Sheffield which does not tell just as strongly against the laws\r\nwhich enjoin the observance of the Sunday as against the bill on our\r\ntable? Surely, if his reasoning is good for hours, it must be equally\r\ngood for days.\r\n\r\nHe says, \"If this limitation be good for the working people, rely on it\r\nthat they will find it out, and that they will themselves establish it\r\nwithout any law.\" Why not reason in the same way about the Sunday? Why\r\nnot say, \"If it be a good thing for the people of London to shut their\r\nshops one day in seven, they will find it out, and will shut their shops\r\nwithout a law?\" Sir, the answer is obvious. I have no doubt that, if\r\nyou were to poll the shopkeepers of London, you would find an immense\r\nmajority, probably a hundred to one, in favour of closing shops on the\r\nSunday; and yet it is absolutely necessary to give to the wish of the\r\nmajority the sanction of a law; for, if there were no such law, the\r\nminority, by opening their shops, would soon force the majority to do\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\nBut, says my honourable friend, you cannot limit the labour of adults\r\nunless you fix wages. This proposition he lays down repeatedly,\r\nassures us that it is incontrovertible, and indeed seems to think it\r\nself-evident; for he has not taken the trouble to prove it. Sir, my\r\nanswer shall be very short. We have, during many centuries, limited the\r\nlabour of adults to six days in seven; and yet we have not fixed the\r\nrate of wages.\r\n\r\nBut, it is said, you cannot legislate for all trades; and therefore you\r\nhad better not legislate for any. Look at the poor sempstress. She works\r\nfar longer and harder than the factory child. She sometimes plies her\r\nneedle fifteen, sixteen hours in the twenty-four. See how the housemaid\r\nworks, up at six every morning, and toiling up stairs and down stairs\r\ntill near midnight. You own that you cannot do anything for the\r\nsempstress and the housemaid. Why then trouble yourself about the\r\nfactory child? Take care that by protecting one class you do not\r\naggravate the hardships endured by the classes which you cannot protect.\r\nWhy, Sir, might not all this be said, word for word, against the laws\r\nwhich enjoin the observance of the Sunday? There are classes of people\r\nwhom you cannot prevent from working on the Sunday. There are classes of\r\npeople whom, if you could, you ought not to prevent from working on the\r\nSunday. Take the sempstress, of whom so much has been said. You cannot\r\nkeep her from sewing and hemming all Sunday in her garret. But you\r\ndo not think that a reason for suffering Covent Garden Market, and\r\nLeadenhall Market, and Smithfield Market, and all the shops from Mile\r\nEnd to Hyde Park to be open all Sunday. Nay, these factories about which\r\nwe are debating,--does anybody propose that they shall be allowed to\r\nwork all Sunday? See then how inconsistent you are. You think it unjust\r\nto limit the labour of the factory child to ten hours a day, because you\r\ncannot limit the labour of the sempstress. And yet you see no injustice\r\nin limiting the labour of the factory child, aye, and of the factory\r\nman, to six days in the week, though you cannot limit the labour of the\r\nsempstress.\r\n\r\nBut, you say, by protecting one class we shall aggravate the sufferings\r\nof all the classes which we cannot protect. You say this; but you do not\r\nprove it; and all experience proves the contrary. We interfere on the\r\nSunday to close the shops. We do not interfere with the labour of the\r\nhousemaid. But are the housemaids of London more severely worked on the\r\nSunday than on other days? The fact notoriously is the reverse. For your\r\nlegislation keeps the public feeling in a right state, and thus protects\r\nindirectly those whom it cannot protect directly.\r\n\r\nWill my honourable friend the Member for Sheffield maintain that the\r\nlaw which limits the number of working days has been injurious to the\r\nworking population? I am certain that he will not. How then can he\r\nexpect me to believe that a law which limits the number of working hours\r\nmust necessarily be injurious to the working population? Yet he and\r\nthose who agree with him seem to wonder at our dulness because we do\r\nnot at once admit the truth of the doctrine which they propound on\r\nthis subject. They reason thus. We cannot reduce the number of hours of\r\nlabour in factories without reducing the amount of production. We cannot\r\nreduce the amount of production without reducing the remuneration of the\r\nlabourer. Meanwhile, foreigners, who are at liberty to work till they\r\ndrop down dead at their looms, will soon beat us out of all the markets\r\nof the world. Wages will go down fast. The condition of our working\r\npeople will be far worse than it is; and our unwise interference will,\r\nlike the unwise interference of our ancestors with the dealings of the\r\ncorn factor and the money lender, increase the distress of the very\r\nclass which we wish to relieve.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, I fully admit that there might be such a limitation of the\r\nhours of labour as would produce the evil consequences with which we are\r\nthreatened; and this, no doubt, is a very good reason for legislating\r\nwith great caution, for feeling our way, for looking well to all the\r\ndetails of this bill. But it is certainly not true that every limitation\r\nof the hours of labour must produce these consequences. And I am, I must\r\nsay, surprised when I hear men of eminent ability and knowledge lay down\r\nthe proposition that a diminution of the time of labour must be followed\r\nby diminution of the wages of labour, as a proposition universally\r\ntrue, as a proposition capable of being strictly demonstrated, as\r\na proposition about which there can be no more doubt than about any\r\ntheorem in Euclid. Sir, I deny the truth of the proposition; and for\r\nthis plain reason. We have already, by law, greatly reduced the time of\r\nlabour in factories. Thirty years ago, the late Sir Robert Peel told the\r\nHouse that it was a common practice to make children of eight years of\r\nage toil in mills fifteen hours a day. A law has since been made which\r\nprohibits persons under eighteen years of age from working in mills\r\nmore than twelve hours a day. That law was opposed on exactly the same\r\ngrounds on which the bill before us is opposed. Parliament was told\r\nthen, as it is told now, that with the time of labour the quantity of\r\nproduction would decrease, that with the quantity of production the\r\nwages would decrease, that our manufacturers would be unable to contend\r\nwith foreign manufacturers, and that the condition of the labouring\r\npopulation instead of being made better by the interference of the\r\nLegislature would be made worse. Read over those debates; and you may\r\nimagine that you are reading the debate of this evening. Parliament\r\ndisregarded these prophecies. The time of labour was limited. Have wages\r\nfallen? Has the cotton trade left Manchester for France or Germany? Has\r\nthe condition of the working people become more miserable? Is it not\r\nuniversally acknowledged that the evils which were so confidently\r\npredicted have not come to pass? Let me be understood. I am not arguing\r\nthat, because a law which reduced the hours of daily labour from fifteen\r\nto twelve did not reduce wages, a law reducing those hours from twelve\r\nto ten or eleven cannot possibly reduce wages. That would be very\r\ninconclusive reasoning. What I say is this, that, since a law which\r\nreduced the hours of daily labour from fifteen to twelve has not reduced\r\nwages, the proposition that every reduction of the hours of labour must\r\nnecessarily reduce wages is a false proposition. There is evidently\r\nsome flaw in that demonstration which my honourable friend thinks so\r\ncomplete; and what the flaw is we may perhaps discover if we look at the\r\nanalogous case to which I have so often referred.\r\n\r\nSir, exactly three hundred years ago, great religious changes were\r\ntaking place in England. Much was said and written, in that inquiring\r\nand innovating age, about the question whether Christians were under a\r\nreligious obligation to rest from labour on one day in the week; and it\r\nis well known that the chief Reformers, both here and on the Continent,\r\ndenied the existence of any such obligation. Suppose then that, in 1546,\r\nParliament had made a law that they should thenceforth be no distinction\r\nbetween the Sunday and any other day. Now, Sir, our opponents, if they\r\nare consistent with themselves, must hold that such a law would have\r\nimmensely increased the wealth of the country and the remuneration of\r\nthe working man. What an effect, if their principles be sound, must have\r\nbeen produced by the addition of one sixth to the time of labour! What\r\nan increase of production! What a rise of wages! How utterly unable must\r\nthe foreign artisan, who still had his days of festivity and of repose,\r\nhave found himself to maintain a competition with a people whose shops\r\nwere open, whose markets were crowded, whose spades and axes, and\r\nplanes, and hods, and anvils, and looms were at work from morning till\r\nnight on three hundred and sixty-five days a year! The Sundays of three\r\nhundred years make up fifty years of our working days. We know what the\r\nindustry of fifty years can do. We know what marvels the industry of\r\nthe last fifty years has wrought. The arguments of my honourable friend\r\nirresistibly lead us to this conclusion, that if, during the last three\r\ncenturies, the Sunday had not been observed as a day of rest, we should\r\nhave been a far richer, a far more highly civilised people than we\r\nnow are, and that the labouring classes especially would have been far\r\nbetter off than at present. But does he, does any Member of the House,\r\nseriously believe that this would have been the case? For my own part,\r\nI have not the smallest doubt that, if we and our ancestors had, during\r\nthe last three centuries, worked just as hard on the Sunday as on the\r\nweek days, we should have been at this moment a poorer people and a less\r\ncivilised people than we are; that there would have been less production\r\nthan there has been, that the wages of the labourer would have been\r\nlower than they are, and that some other nation would have been now\r\nmaking cotton stuffs and woollen stuffs and cutlery for the whole world.\r\n\r\nOf course, Sir, I do not mean to say that a man will not produce more in\r\na week by working seven days than by working six days. But I very much\r\ndoubt whether, at the end of a year, he will generally have produced\r\nmore by working seven days a week than by working six days a week; and\r\nI firmly believe that, at the end of twenty years, he will have produced\r\nmuch less by working seven days a week than by working six days a week.\r\nIn the same manner I do not deny that a factory child will produce more,\r\nin a single day, by working twelve hours than by working ten hours, and\r\nby working fifteen hours than by working twelve hours. But I do deny\r\nthat a great society in which children work fifteen, or even twelve\r\nhours a day will, in the lifetime of a generation, produce as much as\r\nif those children had worked less. If we consider man merely in a\r\ncommercial point of view, if we consider him merely as a machine for\r\nthe production of worsted and calico, let us not forget what a piece of\r\nmechanism he is, how fearfully and wonderfully made. We do not treat a\r\nfine horse or a sagacious dog exactly as we treat a spinning jenny. Nor\r\nwill any slaveholder, who has sense enough to know his own interest,\r\ntreat his human chattels exactly as he treats his horses and his dogs.\r\nAnd would you treat the free labourer of England like a mere wheel or\r\npulley? Rely on it that intense labour, beginning too early in life,\r\ncontinued too long every day, stunting the growth of the body, stunting\r\nthe growth of the mind, leaving no time for healthful exercise, leaving\r\nno time for intellectual culture, must impair all those high qualities\r\nwhich have made our country great. Your overworked boys will become a\r\nfeeble and ignoble race of men, the parents of a more feeble and more\r\nignoble progeny; nor will it be long before the deterioration of the\r\nlabourer will injuriously affect those very interests to which his\r\nphysical and moral energies have been sacrificed. On the other hand,\r\na day of rest recurring in every week, two or three hours of leisure,\r\nexercise, innocent amusement or useful study, recurring every day, must\r\nimprove the whole man, physically, morally, intellectually; and the\r\nimprovement of the man will improve all that the man produces. Why is\r\nit, Sir, that the Hindoo cotton manufacturer, close to whose door\r\nthe cotton grows, cannot, in the bazaar of his own town, maintain\r\na competition with the English cotton manufacturer, who has to send\r\nthousands of miles for the raw material, and who has then to send the\r\nwrought material thousands of miles to market? You will say that it is\r\nowing to the excellence of our machinery. And to what is the excellence\r\nof our machinery owing? How many of the improvements which have been\r\nmade in our machinery do we owe to the ingenuity and patient thought of\r\nworking men? Adam Smith tells us in the first chapter of his great work,\r\nthat you can hardly go to a factory without seeing some very pretty\r\nmachine,--that is his expression,--devised by some labouring man.\r\nHargraves, the inventor of the spinning jenny, was a common artisan.\r\nCrompton, the inventor of the mule jenny, was a working man. How many\r\nhours of the labour of children would do so much for our manufactures as\r\none of these improvements has done? And in what sort of society are such\r\nimprovements most likely to be made? Surely in a society in which the\r\nfaculties of the working people are developed by education. How long\r\nwill you wait before any negro, working under the lash in Louisiana,\r\nwill contrive a better machinery for squeezing the sugar canes?\r\nMy honourable friend seems to me, in all his reasonings about the\r\ncommercial prosperity of nations, to overlook entirely the chief cause\r\non which that prosperity depends. What is it, Sir, that makes the great\r\ndifference between country and country? Not the exuberance of soil; not\r\nthe mildness of climate; not mines, nor havens, nor rivers. These things\r\nare indeed valuable when put to their proper use by human intelligence:\r\nbut human intelligence can do much without them; and they without human\r\nintelligence can do nothing. They exist in the highest degree in regions\r\nof which the inhabitants are few, and squalid, and barbarous, and naked,\r\nand starving; while on sterile rocks, amidst unwholesome marshes, and\r\nunder inclement skies, may be found immense populations, well fed, well\r\nlodged, well clad, well governed. Nature meant Egypt and Sicily to be\r\nthe gardens of the world. They once were so. Is it anything in the earth\r\nor in the air that makes Scotland more prosperous than Egypt, that makes\r\nHolland more prosperous than Sicily? No; it was the Scotchman that made\r\nScotland; it was the Dutchman that made Holland. Look at North America.\r\nTwo centuries ago the sites on which now arise mills, and hotels, and\r\nbanks, and colleges, and churches, and the Senate Houses of flourishing\r\ncommonwealths, were deserts abandoned to the panther and the bear. What\r\nhas made the change? Was it the rich mould, or the redundant rivers? No:\r\nthe prairies were as fertile, the Ohio and the Hudson were as broad\r\nand as full then as now. Was the improvement the effect of some great\r\ntransfer of capital from the old world to the new? No, the emigrants\r\ngenerally carried out with them no more than a pittance; but they\r\ncarried out the English heart, and head, and arm; and the English heart\r\nand head and arm turned the wilderness into cornfield and orchard, and\r\nthe huge trees of the primeval forest into cities and fleets. Man, man\r\nis the great instrument that produces wealth. The natural difference\r\nbetween Campania and Spitzbergen is trifling, when compared with the\r\ndifference between a country inhabited by men full of bodily and\r\nmental vigour, and a country inhabited by men sunk in bodily and mental\r\ndecrepitude. Therefore it is that we are not poorer but richer, because\r\nwe have, through many ages, rested from our labour one day in seven.\r\nThat day is not lost. While industry is suspended, while the plough lies\r\nin the furrow, while the Exchange is silent, while no smoke ascends from\r\nthe factory, a process is going on quite as important to the wealth of\r\nnations as any process which is performed on more busy days. Man,\r\nthe machine of machines, the machine compared with which all the\r\ncontrivances of the Watts and the Arkwrights are worthless, is repairing\r\nand winding up, so that he returns to his labours on the Monday with\r\nclearer intellect, with livelier spirits, with renewed corporal\r\nvigour. Never will I believe that what makes a population stronger, and\r\nhealthier, and wiser, and better, can ultimately make it poorer. You try\r\nto frighten us by telling us, that in some German factories, the young\r\nwork seventeen hours in the twenty-four, that they work so hard that\r\namong thousands there is not one who grows to such a stature that he can\r\nbe admitted into the army; and you ask whether, if we pass this bill, we\r\ncan possibly hold our own against such competition as this? Sir, I laugh\r\nat the thought of such competition. If ever we are forced to yield the\r\nforemost place among commercial nations, we shall yield it, not to a\r\nrace of degenerate dwarfs, but to some people pre-eminently vigorous in\r\nbody and in mind.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Sir, I approve of the principle of this bill, and\r\nshall, without hesitation, vote for the second reading. To what extent\r\nwe ought to reduce the hours of labour is a question of more difficulty.\r\nI think that we are in the situation of a physician who has satisfied\r\nhimself that there is a disease, and that there is a specific medicine\r\nfor the disease, but who is not certain what quantity of that medicine\r\nthe patient's constitution will bear. Such a physician would probably\r\nadminister his remedy by small doses, and carefully watch its operation.\r\nI cannot help thinking that, by at once reducing the hours of labour\r\nfrom twelve to ten, we should hazard too much. The change is great, and\r\nought to be cautiously and gradually made. Suppose that there should be\r\nan immediate fall of wages, which is not impossible. Might there not\r\nbe a violent reaction? Might not the public take up a notion that our\r\nlegislation had been erroneous in principle, though, in truth, our error\r\nwould have been an error, not of principle, but merely of degree? Might\r\nnot Parliament be induced to retrace its steps? Might we not find it\r\ndifficult to maintain even the present limitation? The wisest course\r\nwould, in my opinion, be to reduce the hours of labour from twelve to\r\neleven, to observe the effect of that experiment, and if, as I hope\r\nand believe, the result should be satisfactory, then to make a further\r\nreduction from eleven to ten. This is a question, however, which will be\r\nwith more advantage considered when we are in Committee.\r\n\r\nOne word, Sir, before I sit down, in answer to my noble friend near me.\r\n(Lord Morpeth.) He seems to think that this bill is ill timed. I own\r\nthat I cannot agree with him. We carried up on Monday last to the bar\r\nof the Lords a bill which will remove the most hateful and pernicious\r\nrestriction that ever was laid on trade. Nothing can be more proper\r\nthan to apply, in the same week, a remedy to a great evil of a directly\r\nopposite kind. As lawgivers, we have two great faults to confess and to\r\nrepair. We have done that which we ought not to have done. We have left\r\nundone that which we ought to have done. We have regulated that which we\r\nshould have left to regulate itself. We have left unregulated that which\r\nwe were bound to regulate. We have given to some branches of industry\r\na protection which has proved their bane. We have withheld from public\r\nhealth and public morals the protection which was their due. We have\r\nprevented the labourer from buying his loaf where he could get it\r\ncheapest; but we have not prevented him from ruining his body and mind\r\nby premature and immoderate toil. I hope that we have seen the last\r\nboth of a vicious system of interference and of a vicious system of\r\nnon-interference, and that our poorer countrymen will no longer have\r\nreason to attribute their sufferings either to our meddling or to our\r\nneglect.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LITERATURE OF BRITAIN. (NOVEMBER 4, 1846) A SPEECH DELIVERED AT\r\nTHE OPENING OF THE EDINBURGH PHILOSOPHICAL INSTITUTION ON THE 4TH OF\r\nNOVEMBER 1846.\r\n\r\nI thank you, Gentlemen, for this cordial reception. I have thought it\r\nright to steal a short time from duties not unimportant for the purpose\r\nof lending my aid to a an undertaking calculated, as I think, to raise\r\nthe credit and to promote the best interests of the city which has so\r\nmany claims on my gratitude.\r\n\r\nThe Directors of our Institution have requested me to propose to you as\r\na toast the Literature of Britain. They could not have assigned to me\r\na more agreeable duty. They chief object of this Institution is, I\r\nconceive, to impart knowledge through the medium of our own language.\r\nEdinburgh is already rich in libraries worthy of her fame as a seat\r\nof literature and a seat of jurisprudence. A man of letters can here\r\nwithout difficulty obtain access to repositories filled with the wisdom\r\nof many ages and of many nations. But something was still wanting.\r\nWe still wanted a library open to that large, that important, that\r\nrespectable class which, though by no means destitute of liberal\r\ncuriosity or of sensibility to literary pleasures, is yet forced to\r\nbe content with what is written in our own tongue. For that class\r\nespecially, I do not say exclusively, this library is intended.\r\nOur directors, I hope, will not be satisfied, I, as a member, shall\r\ncertainly not be satisfied, till we possess a noble and complete\r\ncollection of English books, till it is impossible to seek in vain\r\non our shelves for a single English book which is valuable either on\r\naccount of matter or on account of manner, which throws any light on our\r\ncivil, ecclesiastical, intellectual, or social history, which, in short,\r\ncan afford either useful instruction or harmless amusement.\r\n\r\nFrom such a collection, placed within the reach of that large and\r\nvaluable class which I have mentioned, I am disposed to expect great\r\ngood. And when I say this, I do not take into the account those rare\r\ncases to which my valued friend, the Lord Provost (Mr Adam Black.), so\r\nhappily alluded. It is indeed not impossible that some man of genius who\r\nmay enrich our literature with imperishable eloquence or song, or who\r\nmay extend the empire of our race over matter, may feel in our reading\r\nroom, for the first time the consciousness of powers yet undeveloped.\r\nIt is not impossible that our volumes may suggest the first thought of\r\nsomething great to some future Burns, or Watt, or Arkwright. But I do\r\nnot speak of these extraordinary cases. What I confidently anticipate is\r\nthat, through the whole of that class whose benefit we have peculiarly\r\nin view, there will be a moral and an intellectual improvement; that\r\nmany hours, which might otherwise be wasted in folly or in vice, will\r\nbe employed in pursuits which, while they afford the highest and most\r\nlasting pleasure, are not only harmless, but purifying and elevating.\r\nMy own experience, my own observation, justifies me in entertaining this\r\nhope. I have had opportunities, both in this and in other countries, of\r\nforming some estimate of the effect which is likely to be produced by\r\na good collection of books on a society of young men. There is, I will\r\nventure to say, no judicious commanding officer of a regiment who\r\nwill not tell you that the vicinity of a valuable library will improve\r\nperceptibly the whole character of a mess. I well knew one eminent\r\nmilitary servant of the East India Company, a man of great and various\r\naccomplishments, a man honourably distinguished both in war and in\r\ndiplomacy, a man who enjoyed the confidence of some of the greatest\r\ngenerals and statesmen of our time. When I asked him how, having left\r\nhis country while still a boy, and having passed his youth at military\r\nstations in India, he had been able to educate himself, his answer was,\r\nthat he had been stationed in the neighbourhood of an excellent library,\r\nthat he had been allowed free access to the books, and that they had, at\r\nthe most critical time of his life, decided his character, and saved him\r\nfrom being a mere smoking, card-playing, punch-drinking lounger.\r\n\r\nSome of the objections which have been made to such institutions as\r\nours have been so happily and completely refuted by my friend the Lord\r\nProvost, and by the Most Reverend Prelate who has honoured us with his\r\npresence this evening (Archbishop Whateley.), that it would be idle to\r\nsay again what has been so well said. There is, however, one objection\r\nwhich, with your permission, I will notice. Some men, of whom I wish\r\nto speak with great respect, are haunted, as it seems to me, with an\r\nunreasonable fear of what they call superficial knowledge. Knowledge,\r\nthey say, which really deserves the name, is a great blessing to\r\nmankind, the ally of virtue, the harbinger of freedom. But such\r\nknowledge must be profound. A crowd of people who have a smattering of\r\nmathematics, a smattering of astronomy, a smattering of chemistry, who\r\nhave read a little poetry and a little history, is dangerous to the\r\ncommonwealth. Such half-knowledge is worse than ignorance. And then the\r\nauthority of Pope is vouched. Drink deep or taste not; shallow draughts\r\nintoxicate: drink largely; and that will sober you. I must confess that\r\nthe danger which alarms these gentlemen never seemed to me very serious:\r\nand my reason is this; that I never could prevail on any person who\r\npronounced superficial knowledge a curse, and profound knowledge a\r\nblessing, to tell me what was his standard of profundity. The argument\r\nproceeds on the supposition that there is some line between profound\r\nand superficial knowledge similar to that which separates truth from\r\nfalsehood. I know of no such line. When we talk of men of deep science,\r\ndo we mean that they have got to the bottom or near the bottom of\r\nscience? Do we mean that they know all that is capable of being known?\r\nDo we mean even that they know, in their own especial department, all\r\nthat the smatterers of the next generation will know? Why, if we compare\r\nthe little truth that we know with the infinite mass of truth which we\r\ndo not know, we are all shallow together; and the greatest philosophers\r\nthat ever lived would be the first to confess their shallowness. If we\r\ncould call up the first of human beings, if we could call up Newton,\r\nand ask him whether, even in those sciences in which he had no rival, he\r\nconsidered himself as profoundly knowing, he would have told us that he\r\nwas but a smatterer like ourselves, and that the difference between his\r\nknowledge and ours vanished, when compared with the quantity of truth\r\nstill undiscovered, just as the distance between a person at the foot of\r\nBen Lomond and at the top of Ben Lomond vanishes when compared with the\r\ndistance of the fixed stars.\r\n\r\nIt is evident then that those who are afraid of superficial knowledge\r\ndo not mean by superficial knowledge knowledge which is superficial when\r\ncompared with the whole quantity of truth capable of being known. For,\r\nin that sense, all human knowledge is, and always has been, and always\r\nmust be, superficial. What then is the standard? Is it the same two\r\nyears together in any country? Is it the same, at the same moment, in\r\nany two countries? Is it not notorious that the profundity of one age\r\nis the shallowness of the next; that the profundity of one nation is the\r\nshallowness of a neighbouring nation? Ramohun Roy passed, among Hindoos,\r\nfor a man of profound Western learning; but he would have been but a\r\nvery superficial member of this Institute. Strabo was justly entitled\r\nto be called a profound geographer eighteen hundred years ago. But\r\na teacher of geography, who had never heard of America, would now be\r\nlaughed at by the girls of a boarding-school. What would now be thought\r\nof the greatest chemist of 1746, or of the greatest geologist of\r\n1746? The truth is that, in all experimental science, mankind is, of\r\nnecessity, constantly advancing. Every generation, of course, has its\r\nfront rank and its rear rank; but the rear rank of a later generation\r\noccupies the ground which was occupied by the front rank of a former\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nYou remember Gulliver's adventures. First he is shipwrecked in a country\r\nof little men; and he is a Colossus among them. He strides over the\r\nwalls of their capital: he stands higher than the cupola of their great\r\ntemple: he tugs after him a royal fleet: he stretches his legs; and a\r\nroyal army, with drums beating and colours flying, marches through the\r\ngigantic arch: he devours a whole granary for breakfast, eats a herd of\r\ncattle for dinner, and washes down his meal with all the hogsheads of a\r\ncellar. In his next voyage he is among men sixty feet high. He who, in\r\nLilliput, used to take people up in his hand in order that he might be\r\nable to hear them, is himself taken up in the hands and held to the\r\nears of his masters. It is all that he can do to defend himself with his\r\nhanger against the rats and mice. The court ladies amuse themselves with\r\nseeing him fight wasps and frogs: the monkey runs off with him to the\r\nchimney top: the dwarf drops him into the cream jug and leaves him to\r\nswim for his life. Now, was Gulliver a tall or a short man? Why, in his\r\nown house at Rotherhithe, he was thought a man of the ordinary stature.\r\nTake him to Lilliput; and he is Quinbus Flestrin, the Man Mountain. Take\r\nhim to Brobdingnag, and he is Grildrig, the little Manikin. It is the\r\nsame in science. The pygmies of one society would have passed for giants\r\nin another.\r\n\r\nIt might be amusing to institute a comparison between one of the\r\nprofoundly learned men of the thirteenth century and one of the\r\nsuperficial students who will frequent our library. Take the great\r\nphilosopher of the time of Henry the Third of England, or Alexander the\r\nThird of Scotland, the man renowned all over the island, and even as far\r\nas Italy and Spain, as the first of astronomers and chemists. What is\r\nhis astronomy? He is a firm believer in the Ptolemaic system. He never\r\nheard of the law of gravitation. Tell him that the succession of day and\r\nnight is caused by the turning of the earth on its axis. Tell him\r\nthat, in consequence of this motion, the polar diameter of the earth is\r\nshorter than the equatorial diameter. Tell him that the succession of\r\nsummer and winter is caused by the revolution of the earth round the\r\nsun. If he does not set you down for an idiot, he lays an information\r\nagainst you before the Bishop, and has you burned for a heretic. To do\r\nhim justice, however, if he is ill informed on these points, there\r\nare other points on which Newton and Laplace were mere children when\r\ncompared with him. He can cast your nativity. He knows what will happen\r\nwhen Saturn is in the House of Life, and what will happen when Mars is\r\nin conjunction with the Dragon's Tail. He can read in the stars whether\r\nan expedition will be successful, whether the next harvest will be\r\nplentiful, which of your children will be fortunate in marriage, and\r\nwhich will be lost at sea. Happy the State, happy the family, which\r\nis guided by the counsels of so profound a man! And what but mischief,\r\npublic and private, can we expect from the temerity and conceit of\r\nscolists who know no more about the heavenly bodies than what they have\r\nlearned from Sir John Herschel's beautiful little volume. But, to speak\r\nseriously, is not a little truth better than a great deal of falsehood?\r\nIs not the man who, in the evenings of a fortnight, has acquired a\r\ncorrect notion of the solar system, a more profound astronomer than a\r\nman who has passed thirty years in reading lectures about the primum\r\nmobile, and in drawing schemes of horoscopes?\r\n\r\nOr take chemistry. Our philosopher of the thirteenth century shall be,\r\nif you please, an universal genius, chemist as well as astronomer.\r\nHe has perhaps got so far as to know, that if he mixes charcoal and\r\nsaltpetre in certain proportions and then applies fire, there will be\r\nan explosion which will shatter all his retorts and aludels; and he is\r\nproud of knowing what will in a later age be familiar to all the idle\r\nboys in the kingdom. But there are departments of science in which he\r\nneed not fear the rivalry of Black, or Lavoisier, or Cavendish, or Davy.\r\nHe is in hot pursuit of the philosopher's stone, of the stone that is\r\nto bestow wealth, and health, and longevity. He has a long array of\r\nstrangely shaped vessels, filled with red oil and white oil, constantly\r\nboiling. The moment of projection is at hand; and soon all his kettles\r\nand gridirons will be turned into pure gold. Poor Professor Faraday can\r\ndo nothing of the sort. I should deceive you if I held out to you the\r\nsmallest hope that he will ever turn your halfpence into sovereigns. But\r\nif you can induce him to give at our Institute a course of lectures such\r\nas I once heard him give at the Royal Institution to children in the\r\nChristmas holidays, I can promise you that you will know more about the\r\neffects produced on bodies by heat and moisture than was known to some\r\nalchemists who, in the middle ages, were thought worthy of the patronage\r\nof kings.\r\n\r\nAs it has been in science so it has been in literature. Compare the\r\nliterary acquirements of the great men of the thirteenth century with\r\nthose which will be within the reach of many who will frequent our\r\nreading room. As to Greek learning, the profound man of the thirteenth\r\ncentury was absolutely on a par with the superficial man of the\r\nnineteenth. In the modern languages, there was not, six hundred years\r\nago, a single volume which is now read. The library of our profound\r\nscholar must have consisted entirely of Latin books. We will suppose\r\nhim to have had both a large and a choice collection. We will allow him\r\nthirty, nay forty manuscripts, and among them a Virgil, a Terence, a\r\nLucan, an Ovid, a Statius, a great deal of Livy, a great deal of Cicero.\r\nIn allowing him all this, we are dealing most liberally with him; for it\r\nis much more likely that his shelves were filled with treaties on school\r\ndivinity and canon law, composed by writers whose names the world has\r\nvery wisely forgotten. But, even if we suppose him to have possessed\r\nall that is most valuable in the literature of Rome, I say with perfect\r\nconfidence that, both in respect of intellectual improvement, and in\r\nrespect of intellectual pleasures, he was far less favourably situated\r\nthan a man who now, knowing only the English language, has a bookcase\r\nfilled with the best English works. Our great man of the Middle Ages\r\ncould not form any conception of any tragedy approaching Macbeth or\r\nLear, or of any comedy equal to Henry the Fourth or Twelfth Night. The\r\nbest epic poem that he had read was far inferior to the Paradise Lost;\r\nand all the tomes of his philosophers were not worth a page of the Novum\r\nOrganum.\r\n\r\nThe Novum Organum, it is true, persons who know only English must read\r\nin a translation: and this reminds me of one great advantage which such\r\npersons will derive from our Institution. They will, in our library, be\r\nable to form some acquaintance with the master minds of remote ages and\r\nforeign countries. A large part of what is best worth knowing in ancient\r\nliterature, and in the literature of France, Italy, Germany, and Spain,\r\nhas been translated into our own tongue. It is scarcely possible that\r\nthe translation of any book of the highest class can be equal to the\r\noriginal. But, though the finer touches may be lost in the copy, the\r\ngreat outlines will remain. An Englishman who never saw the frescoes in\r\nthe Vatican may yet, from engravings, form some notion of the exquisite\r\ngrace of Raphael, and of the sublimity and energy of Michael Angelo. And\r\nso the genius of Homer is seen in the poorest version of the Iliad; the\r\ngenius of Cervantes is seen in the poorest version of Don Quixote. Let\r\nit not be supposed that I wish to dissuade any person from studying\r\neither the ancient languages or the languages of modern Europe. Far from\r\nit. I prize most highly those keys of knowledge; and I think that no man\r\nwho has leisure for study ought to be content until he possesses several\r\nof them. I always much admired a saying of the Emperor Charles the\r\nFifth. \"When I learn a new language,\" he said, \"I feel as if I had got\r\na new soul.\" But I would console those who have not time to make\r\nthemselves linguists by assuring them that, by means of their own mother\r\ntongue, they may obtain ready access to vast intellectual treasures, to\r\ntreasures such as might have been envied by the greatest linguists of\r\nthe age of Charles the Fifth, to treasures surpassing those which were\r\npossessed by Aldus, by Erasmus, and by Melancthon.\r\n\r\nAnd thus I am brought back to the point from which I started. I have\r\nbeen requested to invite you to fill your glasses to the Literature of\r\nBritain; to that literature, the brightest, the purest, the most durable\r\nof all the glories of our country; to that literature, so rich in\r\nprecious truth and precious fiction; to that literature which boasts of\r\nthe prince of all poets and of the prince of all philosophers; to that\r\nliterature which has exercised an influence wider than that of our\r\ncommerce, and mightier than that of our arms; to that literature which\r\nhas taught France the principles of liberty, and has furnished Germany\r\nwith models of art; to that literature which forms a tie closer than the\r\ntie of consanguinity between us and the commonwealths of the valley of\r\nthe Mississippi; to that literature before the light of which impious\r\nand cruel superstitions are fast taking flight on the banks of the\r\nGanges; to that literature which will, in future ages, instruct and\r\ndelight the unborn millions who will have turned the Australasian\r\nand Caffrarian deserts into cities and gardens. To the Literature of\r\nBritain, then! And, wherever British literature spreads, may it be\r\nattended by British virtue and by British freedom!\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDUCATION. (APRIL 19, 1847) A SPEECH DELIVERED IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS\r\nON THE 18TH OF APRIL 1847.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1847 the Government asked from the House of Commons a grant\r\nof one hundred thousand pounds for the education of the people. On the\r\nnineteenth of April, Lord John Russell, having explained the reasons for\r\nthis application, moved the order of the day for a Committee of Supply.\r\nMr Thomas Duncombe, Member for Finsbury, moved the following amendment:\r\n\"That previous to any grant of public money being assented to by this\r\nHouse, for the purpose of carrying out the scheme of national education,\r\nas developed in the Minutes of the Committee of Council on Education\r\nin August and December last, which minutes have been presented to both\r\nHouses of Parliament by command of Her Majesty, a select Committee be\r\nappointed to inquire into the justice and expediency of such a scheme,\r\nand its probable annual cost; also to inquire whether the regulations\r\nattached thereto do not unduly increase the influence of the Crown,\r\ninvade the constitutional functions of Parliament, and interfere with\r\nthe religious convictions and civil rights of Her Majesty's subjects.\"\r\n\r\nIn opposition to this amendment, the following Speech was made. After\r\na debate of three nights, Mr Thomas Duncombe obtained permission to\r\nwithdraw the latter part of his amendment. The first part was put, and\r\nnegatived by 372 votes to 47.\r\n\r\nYou will not wonder, Sir, that I am desirous to catch your eye this\r\nevening. The first duty which I performed, as a Member of the Committee\r\nof Council which is charged with the superintendence of public\r\ninstruction, was to give my hearty assent to the plan which the\r\nhonourable Member for Finsbury calls on the House to condemn. I am one\r\nof those who have been accused in every part of the kingdom, and who are\r\nnow accused in Parliament, of aiming, under specious pretences, a\r\nblow at the civil and religious liberties of the people. It is natural\r\ntherefore that I should seize the earliest opportunity of vindicating\r\nmyself from so grave a charge.\r\n\r\nThe honourable Member for Finsbury must excuse me if, in the remarks\r\nwhich I have to offer to the House, I should not follow very closely the\r\norder of his speech. The truth is that a mere answer to his speech would\r\nbe no defence of myself or of my colleagues. I am surprised, I own, that\r\na man of his acuteness and ability should, on such an occasion, have\r\nmade such a speech. The country is excited from one end to the other by\r\na great question of principle. On that question the Government has taken\r\none side. The honourable Member stands forth as the chosen and trusted\r\nchampion of a great party which takes the other side. We expected to\r\nhear from him a full exposition of the views of those in whose name he\r\nspeaks. But, to our astonishment, he has scarcely even alluded to the\r\ncontroversy which has divided the whole nation. He has entertained us\r\nwith sarcasms and personal anecdotes: he has talked much about matters\r\nof mere detail: but I must say that, after listening with close\r\nattention to all that he has said, I am quite unable to discover\r\nwhether, on the only important point which is in issue, he agrees\r\nwith us or with that large and active body of Nonconformists which is\r\ndiametrically opposed to us. He has sate down without dropping one word\r\nfrom which it is possible to discover whether he thinks that education\r\nis or that it is not a matter with which the State ought to interfere.\r\nYet that is the question about which the whole nation has, during\r\nseveral weeks, been writing, reading, speaking, hearing, thinking,\r\npetitioning, and on which it is now the duty of Parliament to pronounce\r\na decision. That question once settled, there will be, I believe,\r\nvery little room for dispute. If it be not competent to the State to\r\ninterfere with the education of the people, the mode of interference\r\nrecommended by the Committee of Council must of course be condemned.\r\nIf it be the right and the duty of the State to make provision for the\r\neducation of the people, the objections made to our plan will, in a very\r\nfew words, be shown to be frivolous.\r\n\r\nI shall take a course very different from that which has been taken\r\nby the honourable gentleman. I shall in the clearest manner profess\r\nmy opinion on that great question of principle which he has studiously\r\nevaded; and for my opinion I shall give what seem to me to be\r\nunanswerable reasons.\r\n\r\nI believe, Sir, that it is the right and the duty of the State to\r\nprovide means of education for the common people. This proposition seems\r\nto me to be implied in every definition that has ever yet been given of\r\nthe functions of a government. About the extent of those functions there\r\nhas been much difference of opinion among ingenious men. There are some\r\nwho hold that it is the business of a government to meddle with every\r\npart of the system of human life, to regulate trade by bounties and\r\nprohibitions, to regulate expenditure by sumptuary laws, to regulate\r\nliterature by a censorship, to regulate religion by an inquisition.\r\nOthers go to the opposite extreme, and assign to government a very\r\nnarrow sphere of action. But the very narrowest sphere that ever was\r\nassigned to governments by any school of political philosophy is quite\r\nwide enough for my purpose. On one point all the disputants are agreed.\r\nThey unanimously acknowledge that it is the duty of every government\r\nto take order for giving security to the persons and property of the\r\nmembers of the community.\r\n\r\nThis being admitted, can it be denied that the education of the common\r\npeople is a most effectual means of securing our persons and our\r\nproperty? Let Adam Smith answer that question for me. His authority,\r\nalways high, is, on this subject, entitled to peculiar respect, because\r\nhe extremely disliked busy, prying, interfering governments. He was for\r\nleaving literature, arts, sciences, to take care of themselves. He was\r\nnot friendly to ecclesiastical establishments. He was of opinion, that\r\nthe State ought not to meddle with the education of the rich. But he has\r\nexpressly told us that a distinction is to be made, particularly in a\r\ncommercial and highly civilised society, between the education of the\r\nrich and the education of the poor. The education of the poor, he\r\nsays, is a matter which deeply concerns the commonwealth. Just as the\r\nmagistrate ought to interfere for the purpose of preventing the leprosy\r\nfrom spreading among the people, he ought to interfere for the purpose\r\nof stopping the progress of the moral distempers which are inseparable\r\nfrom ignorance. Nor can this duty be neglected without danger to the\r\npublic peace. If you leave the multitude uninstructed, there is serious\r\nrisk that religious animosities may produce the most dreadful disorders.\r\nThe most dreadful disorders! Those are Adam Smith's own words; and\r\nprophetic words they were. Scarcely had he given this warning to\r\nour rulers when his prediction was fulfilled in a manner never to be\r\nforgotten. I speak of the No Popery riots of 1780. I do not know that I\r\ncould find in all history a stronger proof of the proposition, that the\r\nignorance of the common people makes the property, the limbs, the lives\r\nof all classes insecure. Without the shadow of a grievance, at the\r\nsummons of a madman, a hundred thousand people rise in insurrection.\r\nDuring a whole week, there is anarchy in the greatest and wealthiest\r\nof European cities. The parliament is besieged. Your predecessor sits\r\ntrembling in his chair, and expects every moment to see the door beaten\r\nin by the ruffians whose roar he hears all round the house. The peers\r\nare pulled out of their coaches. The bishops in their lawn are forced to\r\nfly over the tiles. The chapels of foreign ambassadors, buildings made\r\nsacred by the law of nations, are destroyed. The house of the Chief\r\nJustice is demolished. The little children of the Prime Minister are\r\ntaken out of their beds and laid in their night clothes on the table of\r\nthe Horse Guards, the only safe asylum from the fury of the rabble. The\r\nprisons are opened. Highwaymen, housebreakers, murderers, come forth\r\nto swell the mob by which they have been set free. Thirty-six fires are\r\nblazing at once in London. Then comes the retribution. Count up all the\r\nwretches who were shot, who were hanged, who were crushed, who drank\r\nthemselves to death at the rivers of gin which ran down Holborn Hill;\r\nand you will find that battles have been lost and won with a smaller\r\nsacrifice of life. And what was the cause of this calamity, a calamity\r\nwhich, in the history of London, ranks with the great plague and the\r\ngreat fire? The cause was the ignorance of a population which had been\r\nsuffered, in the neighbourhood of palaces, theatres, temples, to grow up\r\nas rude and stupid as any tribe of tattooed cannibals in New Zealand, I\r\nmight say as any drove of beasts in Smithfield Market.\r\n\r\nThe instance is striking: but it is not solitary. To the same cause are\r\nto be ascribed the riots of Nottingham, the sack of Bristol, all the\r\noutrages of Ludd, and Swing, and Rebecca, beautiful and costly machinery\r\nbroken to pieces in Yorkshire, barns and haystacks blazing in Kent,\r\nfences and buildings pulled down in Wales. Could such things have been\r\ndone in a country in which the mind of the labourer had been opened by\r\neducation, in which he had been taught to find pleasure in the exercise\r\nof his intellect, taught to revere his Maker, taught to respect\r\nlegitimate authority, and taught at the same time to seek the redress of\r\nreal wrongs by peaceful and constitutional means?\r\n\r\nThis then is my argument. It is the duty of Government to protect our\r\npersons and property from danger. The gross ignorance of the common\r\npeople is a principal cause of danger to our persons and property.\r\nTherefore, it is the duty of Government to take care that the common\r\npeople shall not be grossly ignorant.\r\n\r\nAnd what is the alternative? It is universally allowed that, by some\r\nmeans, Government must protect our persons and property. If you take\r\naway education, what means do you leave? You leave means such as only\r\nnecessity can justify, means which inflict a fearful amount of pain,\r\nnot only on the guilty, but on the innocent who are connected with\r\nthe guilty. You leave guns and bayonets, stocks and whipping-posts,\r\ntreadmills, solitary cells, penal colonies, gibbets. See then how the\r\ncase stands. Here is an end which, as we all agree, governments are\r\nbound to attain. There are only two ways of attaining it. One of those\r\nways is by making men better, and wiser, and happier. The other way is\r\nby making them infamous and miserable. Can it be doubted which way we\r\nought to prefer? Is it not strange, is it not almost incredible, that\r\npious and benevolent men should gravely propound the doctrine that the\r\nmagistrate is bound to punish and at the same time bound not to teach?\r\nTo me it seems quite clear that whoever has a right to hang has a right\r\nto educate. Can we think without shame and remorse that more than half\r\nof those wretches who have been tied up at Newgate in our time might\r\nhave been living happily, that more than half of those who are now in\r\nour gaols might have been enjoying liberty and using that liberty well,\r\nthat such a hell on earth as Norfolk Island, need never have existed, if\r\nwe had expended in training honest men but a small part of what we have\r\nexpended in hunting and torturing rogues.\r\n\r\nI would earnestly entreat every gentleman to look at a report which\r\nis contained in the Appendix to the First Volume of the Minutes of\r\nthe Committee of Council. I speak of the report made by Mr Seymour\r\nTremenheare on the state of that part of Monmouthshire which is\r\ninhabited by a population chiefly employed in mining. He found that,\r\nin this district, towards the close of 1839, out of eleven thousand\r\nchildren who were of an age to attend school, eight thousand never went\r\nto any school at all, and that most of the remaining three thousand\r\nmight almost as well have gone to no school as to the squalid hovels in\r\nwhich men who ought themselves to have been learners pretended to teach.\r\nIn general these men had only one qualification for their employment;\r\nand that was their utter unfitness for every other employment. They were\r\ndisabled miners, or broken hucksters. In their schools all was stench,\r\nand noise, and confusion. Now and then the clamour of the boys was\r\nsilenced for two minutes by the furious menaces of the master; but it\r\nsoon broke out again. The instruction given was of the lowest kind. Not\r\none school in ten was provided with a single map. This is the way in\r\nwhich you suffered the minds of a great population to be formed. And now\r\nfor the effects of your negligence. The barbarian inhabitants of this\r\nregion rise in an insane rebellion against the Government. They come\r\npouring down their valleys to Newport. They fire on the Queen's troops.\r\nThey wound a magistrate. The soldiers fire in return; and too many of\r\nthese wretched men pay with their lives the penalty of their crime. But\r\nis the crime theirs alone? Is it strange that they should listen to the\r\nonly teaching that they had? How can you, who took no pains to instruct\r\nthem, blame them for giving ear to the demagogue who took pains to\r\ndelude them? We put them down, of course. We punished them. We had no\r\nchoice. Order must be maintained; property must be protected; and, since\r\nwe had omitted to take the best way of keeping these people quiet, we\r\nwere under the necessity of keeping them quiet by the dread of the sword\r\nand the halter. But could any necessity be more cruel? And which of us\r\nwould run the risk of being placed under such necessity a second time?\r\n\r\nI say, therefore, that the education of the people is not only a means,\r\nbut the best means, of attaining that which all allow to be a chief end\r\nof government; and, if this be so, it passes my faculties to understand\r\nhow any man can gravely contend that Government has nothing to do with\r\nthe education of the people.\r\n\r\nMy confidence in my opinion is strengthened when I recollect that I hold\r\nthat opinion in common with all the greatest lawgivers, statesmen,\r\nand political philosophers of all nations and ages, with all the most\r\nillustrious champions of civil and spiritual freedom, and especially\r\nwith those men whose names were once held in the highest veneration\r\nby the Protestant Dissenters of England. I might cite many of the most\r\nvenerable names of the old world; but I would rather cite the example\r\nof that country which the supporters of the Voluntary system here are\r\nalways recommending to us as a pattern. Go back to the days when the\r\nlittle society which has expanded into the opulent and enlightened\r\ncommonwealth of Massachusetts began to exist. Our modern Dissenters will\r\nscarcely, I think, venture to speak contumeliously of those Puritans\r\nwhose spirit Laud and his High Commission Court could not subdue, of\r\nthose Puritans who were willing to leave home and kindred, and all the\r\ncomforts and refinements of civilised life, to cross the ocean, to\r\nfix their abode in forests among wild beasts and wild men, rather than\r\ncommit the sin of performing, in the House of God, one gesture which\r\nthey believed to be displeasing to Him. Did those brave exiles think it\r\ninconsistent with civil or religious freedom that the State should take\r\ncharge of the education of the people? No, Sir; one of the earliest laws\r\nenacted by the Puritan colonists was that every township, as soon as the\r\nLord had increased it to the number of fifty houses, should appoint one\r\nto teach all children to write and read, and that every township of a\r\nhundred houses should set up a grammar school. Nor have the descendants\r\nof those who made this law ever ceased to hold that the public\r\nauthorities were bound to provide the means of public instruction. Nor\r\nis this doctrine confined to New England. \"Educate the people\" was\r\nthe first admonition addressed by Penn to the colony which he founded.\r\n\"Educate the people\" was the legacy of Washington to the nation which\r\nhe had saved. \"Educate the people\" was the unceasing exhortation of\r\nJefferson; and I quote Jefferson with peculiar pleasure, because of all\r\nthe eminent men that have ever lived, Adam Smith himself not excepted,\r\nJefferson was the one who most abhorred everything like meddling on the\r\npart of governments. Yet the chief business of his later years was to\r\nestablish a good system of State education in Virginia.\r\n\r\nAnd, against such authority as this, what have you who take the other\r\nside to show? Can you mention a single great philosopher, a single man\r\ndistinguished by his zeal for liberty, humanity, and truth, who, from\r\nthe beginning of the world down to the time of this present Parliament,\r\never held your doctrines? You can oppose to the unanimous voice of all\r\nthe wise and good, of all ages, and of both hemispheres, nothing but a\r\nclamour which was first heard a few months ago, a clamour in which you\r\ncannot join without condemning, not only all whose memory you profess to\r\nhold in reverence, but even your former selves.\r\n\r\nThis new theory of politics has at least the merit of originality. It\r\nmay be fairly stated thus. All men have hitherto been utterly in the\r\nwrong as to the nature and objects of civil government. The great truth,\r\nhidden from every preceding generation, and at length revealed, in the\r\nyear 1846, to some highly respectable ministers and elders of dissenting\r\ncongregations, is this. Government is simply a great hangman. Government\r\nought to do nothing except by harsh and degrading means. The one\r\nbusiness of Government is to handcuff, and lock up, and scourge, and\r\nshoot, and stab, and strangle. It is odious tyranny in a government to\r\nattempt to prevent crime by informing the understanding and elevating\r\nthe moral feeling of a people. A statesman may see hamlets turned, in\r\nthe course of one generation, into great seaport towns and manufacturing\r\ntowns. He may know that on the character of the vast population which is\r\ncollected in those wonderful towns, depends the prosperity, the peace,\r\nthe very existence of society. But he must not think of forming that\r\ncharacter. He is an enemy of public liberty if he attempts to prevent\r\nthose hundreds of thousands of his countrymen from becoming mere Yahoos.\r\nHe may, indeed, build barrack after barrack to overawe them. If they\r\nbreak out into insurrection, he may send cavalry to sabre them: he may\r\nmow them down with grape shot: he may hang them, draw them, quarter\r\nthem, anything but teach them. He may see, and may shudder as he sees,\r\nthroughout large rural districts, millions of infants growing up from\r\ninfancy to manhood as ignorant, as mere slaves of sensual appetite, as\r\nthe beasts that perish. No matter. He is a traitor to the cause of civil\r\nand religious freedom if he does not look on with folded arms, while\r\nabsurd hopes and evil passions ripen in that rank soil. He must wait for\r\nthe day of his harvest. He must wait till the Jaquerie comes, till farm\r\nhouses are burning, till threshing machines are broken in pieces; and\r\nthen begins his business, which is simply to send one poor ignorant\r\nsavage to the county gaol, and another to the antipodes, and a third to\r\nthe gallows.\r\n\r\nSuch, Sir, is the new theory of government which was first propounded,\r\nin the year 1846, by some men of high note among the Nonconformists of\r\nEngland. It is difficult to understand how men of excellent abilities\r\nand excellent intentions--and there are, I readily admit, such men\r\namong those who hold this theory--can have fallen into so absurd and\r\npernicious an error. One explanation only occurs to me. This is, I am\r\ninclined to believe, an instance of the operation of the great law of\r\nreaction. We have just come victorious out of a long and fierce contest\r\nfor the liberty of trade. While that contest was undecided, much was\r\nsaid and written about the advantages of free competition, and about the\r\ndanger of suffering the State to regulate matters which should be left\r\nto individuals. There has consequently arisen in the minds of persons\r\nwho are led by words, and who are little in the habit of making\r\ndistinctions, a disposition to apply to political questions and moral\r\nquestions principles which are sound only when applied to commercial\r\nquestions. These people, not content with having forced the Government\r\nto surrender a province wrongfully usurped, now wish to wrest from the\r\nGovernment a domain held by a right which was never before questioned,\r\nand which cannot be questioned with the smallest show of reason. \"If,\"\r\nthey say, \"free competition is a good thing in trade, it must surely be\r\na good thing in education. The supply of other commodities, of sugar,\r\nfor example, is left to adjust itself to the demand; and the consequence\r\nis, that we are better supplied with sugar than if the Government\r\nundertook to supply us. Why then should we doubt that the supply of\r\ninstruction will, without the intervention of the Government, be found\r\nequal to the demand?\"\r\n\r\nNever was there a more false analogy. Whether a man is well supplied\r\nwith sugar is a matter which concerns himself alone. But whether he is\r\nwell supplied with instruction is a matter which concerns his neighbours\r\nand the State. If he cannot afford to pay for sugar, he must go without\r\nsugar. But it is by no means fit that, because he cannot afford to pay\r\nfor education, he should go without education. Between the rich and\r\ntheir instructors there may, as Adam Smith says, be free trade. The\r\nsupply of music masters and Italian masters may be left to adjust itself\r\nto the demand. But what is to become of the millions who are too poor\r\nto procure without assistance the services of a decent schoolmaster? We\r\nhave indeed heard it said that even these millions will be supplied with\r\nteachers by the free competition of benevolent individuals who will vie\r\nwith each other in rendering this service to mankind. No doubt there are\r\nmany benevolent individuals who spend their time and money most laudably\r\nin setting up and supporting schools; and you may say, if you please,\r\nthat there is, among these respectable persons, a competition to do\r\ngood. But do not be imposed upon by words. Do not believe that this\r\ncompetition resembles the competition which is produced by the desire of\r\nwealth and by the fear of ruin. There is a great difference, be assured,\r\nbetween the rivalry of philanthropists and the rivalry of grocers. The\r\ngrocer knows that, if his wares are worse than those of other grocers,\r\nhe shall soon go before the Bankrupt Court, and his wife and children\r\nwill have no refuge but the workhouse: he knows that, if his shop\r\nobtains an honourable celebrity, he shall be able to set up a carriage\r\nand buy a villa: and this knowledge impels him to exertions compared\r\nwith which the exertions of even very charitable people to serve\r\nthe poor are but languid. It would be strange infatuation indeed to\r\nlegislate on the supposition that a man cares for his fellow creatures\r\nas much as he cares for himself.\r\n\r\nUnless, Sir, I greatly deceive myself, those arguments, which show\r\nthat the Government ought not to leave to private people the task\r\nof providing for the national defence, will equally show that the\r\nGovernment ought not to leave to private people the task of providing\r\nfor national education. On this subject, Mr Hume has laid down the\r\ngeneral law with admirable good sense and perspicuity. I mean David\r\nHume, not the Member for Montrose, though that honourable gentleman\r\nwill, I am confident, assent to the doctrine propounded by his\r\nillustrious namesake. David Hume, Sir, justly says that most of the\r\narts and trades which exist in the world produce so much advantage and\r\npleasure to individuals, that the magistrate may safely leave it to\r\nindividuals to encourage those arts and trades. But he adds that there\r\nare callings which, though they are highly useful, nay, absolutely\r\nnecessary to society, yet do not administer to the peculiar pleasure\r\nor profit of any individual. The military calling is an instance. Here,\r\nsays Hume, the Government must interfere. It must take on itself to\r\nregulate these callings, and to stimulate the industry of the persons\r\nwho follow these callings by pecuniary and honorary rewards.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, it seems to me that, on the same principle on which Government\r\nought to superintend and to reward the soldier, Government ought to\r\nsuperintend and to reward the schoolmaster. I mean, of course, the\r\nschoolmaster of the common people. That his calling is useful, that his\r\ncalling is necessary, will hardly be denied. Yet it is clear that\r\nhis services will not be adequately remunerated if he is left to be\r\nremunerated by those whom he teaches, or by the voluntary contributions\r\nof the charitable. Is this disputed? Look at the facts. You tell us that\r\nschools will multiply and flourish exceedingly, if the Government will\r\nonly abstain from interfering with them. Has not the Government long\r\nabstained from interfering with them? Has not everything been left,\r\nthrough many years, to individual exertion? If it were true that\r\neducation, like trade, thrives most where the magistrate meddles least,\r\nthe common people of England would now be the best educated in the\r\nworld. Our schools would be model schools. Every one would have a well\r\nchosen little library, excellent maps, a small but neat apparatus for\r\nexperiments in natural philosophy. A grown person unable to read and\r\nwrite would be pointed at like Giant O'Brien or the Polish Count.\r\nOur schoolmasters would be as eminently expert in all that relates to\r\nteaching as our cutlers, our cotton-spinners, our engineers are allowed\r\nto be in their respective callings. They would, as a class, be held in\r\nhigh consideration; and their gains would be such that it would be\r\neasy to find men of respectable character and attainments to fill up\r\nvacancies.\r\n\r\nNow, is this the case? Look at the charges of the judges, at the\r\nresolutions of the grand juries, at the reports of public officers,\r\nat the reports of voluntary associations. All tell the same sad and\r\nignominious story. Take the reports of the Inspectors of Prisons. In\r\nthe House of Correction at Hertford, of seven hundred prisoners one half\r\ncould not read at all; only eight could read and write well. Of eight\r\nthousand prisoners who had passed through Maidstone Gaol only fifty\r\ncould read and write well. In Coldbath Fields Prison, the proportion\r\nthat could read and write well seems to have been still smaller. Turn\r\nfrom the registers of prisoners to the registers of marriages. You will\r\nfind that about a hundred and thirty thousand couples were married in\r\nthe year 1844. More than forty thousand of the bridegrooms and more than\r\nsixty thousand of the brides did not sign their names, but made their\r\nmarks. Nearly one third of the men and nearly one half of the women, who\r\nare in the prime of life, who are to be the parents of the Englishmen of\r\nthe next generation, who are to bear a chief part in forming the minds\r\nof the Englishmen of the next generation, cannot write their own names.\r\nRemember, too, that, though people who cannot write their own names must\r\nbe grossly ignorant, people may write their own names and yet have very\r\nlittle knowledge. Tens of thousands who were able to write their names\r\nhad in all probability received only the wretched education of a common\r\nday school. We know what such a school too often is; a room crusted with\r\nfilth, without light, without air, with a heap of fuel in one corner\r\nand a brood of chickens in another; the only machinery of instruction a\r\ndogeared spelling-book and a broken slate; the masters the refuse of all\r\nother callings, discarded footmen, ruined pedlars, men who cannot work\r\na sum in the rule of three, men who cannot write a common letter without\r\nblunders, men who do not know whether the earth is a sphere or a cube,\r\nmen who do not know whether Jerusalem is in Asia or America. And to such\r\nmen, men to whom none of us would entrust the key of his cellar, we have\r\nentrusted the mind of the rising generation, and, with the mind of the\r\nrising generation the freedom, the happiness, the glory of our country.\r\n\r\nDo you question the accuracy of this description? I will produce\r\nevidence to which I am sure that you will not venture to take an\r\nexception. Every gentleman here knows, I suppose, how important a\r\nplace the Congregational Union holds among the Nonconformists, and\r\nhow prominent a part Mr Edward Baines has taken in opposition to State\r\neducation. A Committee of the Congregational Union drew up last year\r\na report on the subject of education. That report was received by the\r\nUnion; and the person who moved that it should be received was Mr\r\nEdward Baines. That report contains the following passage: \"If it were\r\nnecessary to disclose facts to such an assembly as this, as to the\r\nignorance and debasement of the neglected portions of our population in\r\ntowns and rural districts, both adult and juvenile, it could easily\r\nbe done. Private information communicated to the Board, personal\r\nobservation and investigation of the various localities, with the\r\npublished documents of the Registrar General, and the reports of the\r\nstate of prisons in England and Wales, published by order of the House\r\nof Commons, would furnish enough to make us modest in speaking of what\r\nhas been done for the humbler classes, and make us ashamed that the sons\r\nof the soil of England should have been so long neglected, and should\r\npresent to the enlightened traveller from other shores such a sad\r\nspectacle of neglected cultivation, lost mental power, and spiritual\r\ndegradation.\" Nothing can be more just. All the information which I\r\nhave been able to obtain bears out the statements of the Congregational\r\nUnion. I do believe that the ignorance and degradation of a large\r\npart of the community to which we belong ought to make us ashamed of\r\nourselves. I do believe that an enlightened traveller from New York,\r\nfrom Geneva, or from Berlin, would be shocked to see so much barbarism\r\nin the close neighbourhood of so much wealth and civilisation. But is\r\nit not strange that the very gentlemen who tell us in such emphatic\r\nlanguage that the people are shamefully ill-educated, should yet persist\r\nin telling us that under a system of free competition the people are\r\ncertain to be excellently educated? Only this morning the opponents of\r\nour plan circulated a paper in which they confidently predict that free\r\ncompetition will do all that is necessary, if we will only wait with\r\npatience. Wait with patience! Why, we have been waiting ever since the\r\nHeptarchy. How much longer are we to wait? Till the year 2847? Or till\r\nthe year 3847? That the experiment has as yet failed you do not deny.\r\nAnd why should it have failed? Has it been tried in unfavourable\r\ncircumstances? Not so: it has been tried in the richest and in the\r\nfreest, and in the most charitable country in all Europe. Has it been\r\ntried on too small a scale? Not so: millions have been subjected to it.\r\nHas it been tried during too short a time? Not so: it has been going on\r\nduring ages. The cause of the failure then is plain. Our whole system\r\nhas been unsound. We have applied the principle of free competition to a\r\ncase to which that principle is not applicable.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, if the state of the southern part of our island has furnished\r\nme with one strong argument, the state of the northern part furnishes\r\nme with another argument, which is, if possible, still more decisive.\r\nA hundred and fifty years ago England was one of the best governed and\r\nmost prosperous countries in the world: Scotland was perhaps the rudest\r\nand poorest country that could lay any claim to civilisation. The name\r\nof Scotchman was then uttered in this part of the island with contempt.\r\nThe ablest Scotch statesmen contemplated the degraded state of\r\ntheir poorer countrymen with a feeling approaching to despair. It is\r\nwell-known that Fletcher of Saltoun, a brave and accomplished man, a man\r\nwho had drawn his sword for liberty, who had suffered proscription and\r\nexile for liberty, was so much disgusted and dismayed by the misery, the\r\nignorance, the idleness, the lawlessness of the common people, that he\r\nproposed to make many thousands of them slaves. Nothing, he thought, but\r\nthe discipline which kept order and enforced exertion among the negroes\r\nof a sugar colony, nothing but the lash and the stocks, could reclaim\r\nthe vagabonds who infested every part of Scotland from their indolent\r\nand predatory habits, and compel them to support themselves by steady\r\nlabour. He therefore, soon after the Revolution, published a pamphlet,\r\nin which he earnestly, and, as I believe, from the mere impulse of\r\nhumanity and patriotism, recommended to the Estates of the Realm this\r\nsharp remedy, which alone, as he conceived, could remove the evil.\r\nWithin a few months after the publication of that pamphlet a very\r\ndifferent remedy was applied. The Parliament which sate at Edinburgh\r\npassed an act for the establishment of parochial schools. What followed?\r\nAn improvement such as the world had never seen took place in the moral\r\nand intellectual character of the people. Soon, in spite of the rigour\r\nof the climate, in spite of the sterility of the earth, Scotland became\r\na country which had no reason to envy the fairest portions of the globe.\r\nWherever the Scotchman went,--and there were few parts of the world to\r\nwhich he did not go,--he carried his superiority with him. If he was\r\nadmitted into a public office, he worked his way up to the highest post.\r\nIf he got employment in a brewery or a factory, he was soon the foreman.\r\nIf he took a shop, his trade was the best in the street. If he enlisted\r\nin the army, he became a colour-sergeant. If he went to a colony, he\r\nwas the most thriving planter there. The Scotchman of the seventeenth\r\ncentury had been spoken of in London as we speak of the Esquimaux. The\r\nScotchman of the eighteenth century was an object, not of scorn, but of\r\nenvy. The cry was that, wherever he came, he got more than his share;\r\nthat, mixed with Englishmen or mixed with Irishmen, he rose to the top\r\nas surely as oil rises to the top of water. And what had produced this\r\ngreat revolution? The Scotch air was still as cold, the Scotch rocks\r\nwere still as bare as ever. All the natural qualities of the Scotchman\r\nwere still what they had been when learned and benevolent men advised\r\nthat he should be flogged, like a beast of burden, to his daily task.\r\nBut the State had given him an education. That education was not, it is\r\ntrue, in all respects what it should have been. But such as it was, it\r\nhad done more for the bleak and dreary shores of the Forth and the Clyde\r\nthan the richest of soils and the most genial of climates had done for\r\nCapua and Tarentum. Is there one member of this House, however strongly\r\nhe may hold the doctrine that the Government ought not to interfere\r\nwith the education of the people, who will stand up and say that, in his\r\nopinion, the Scotch would now have been a happier and a more enlightened\r\npeople if they had been left, during the last five generations, to find\r\ninstruction for themselves?\r\n\r\nI say then, Sir, that, if the science of Government be an experimental\r\nscience, this question is decided. We are in a condition to perform the\r\ninductive process according to the rules laid down in the Novum Organum.\r\nWe have two nations closely connected, inhabiting the same island,\r\nsprung from the same blood, speaking the same language, governed by the\r\nsame Sovereign and the same Legislature, holding essentially the same\r\nreligious faith, having the same allies and the same enemies. Of these\r\ntwo nations one was, a hundred and fifty years ago, as respects opulence\r\nand civilisation, in the highest rank among European communities, the\r\nother in the lowest rank. The opulent and highly civilised nation leaves\r\nthe education of the people to free competition. In the poor and half\r\nbarbarous nation the education of the people is undertaken by the State.\r\nThe result is that the first are last and the last first. The common\r\npeople of Scotland,--it is vain to disguise the truth,--have passed the\r\ncommon people of England. Free competition, tried with every advantage,\r\nhas produced effects of which, as the Congregational Union tells us,\r\nwe ought to be ashamed, and which must lower us in the opinion of every\r\nintelligent foreigner. State education, tried under every disadvantage,\r\nhas produced an improvement to which it would be difficult to find a\r\nparallel in any age or country. Such an experiment as this would be\r\nregarded as conclusive in surgery or chemistry, and ought, I think, to\r\nbe regarded as equally conclusive in politics.\r\n\r\nThese, Sir, are the reasons which have satisfied me that it is the\r\nduty of the State to educate the people. Being firmly convinced of that\r\ntruth, I shall not shrink from proclaiming it here and elsewhere, in\r\ndefiance of the loudest clamour that agitators can raise. The remainder\r\nof my task is easy. For, if the great principle for which I have been\r\ncontending is admitted, the objections which have been made to the\r\ndetails of our plan will vanish fast. I will deal with those objections\r\nin the order in which they stand in the amendment moved by the\r\nhonourable Member for Finsbury.\r\n\r\nFirst among his objections he places the cost. Surely, Sir, no person\r\nwho admits that it is our duty to train the minds of the rising\r\ngeneration can think a hundred thousand pounds too large a sum for that\r\npurpose. If we look at the matter in the lowest point of view, if we\r\nconsider human beings merely as producers of wealth, the difference\r\nbetween an intelligent and a stupid population, estimated in pounds,\r\nshillings, and pence, exceeds a hundredfold the proposed outlay. Nor\r\nis this all. For every pound that you save in education, you will spend\r\nfive in prosecutions, in prisons, in penal settlements. I cannot believe\r\nthat the House, having never grudged anything that was asked for the\r\npurpose of maintaining order and protecting property by means of pain\r\nand fear, will begin to be niggardly as soon as it is proposed to effect\r\nthe same objects by making the people wiser and better.\r\n\r\nThe next objection made by the honourable Member to our plan is that it\r\nwill increase the influence of the Crown. This sum of a hundred thousand\r\npounds may, he apprehends, be employed in corruption and jobbing. Those\r\nschoolmasters who vote for ministerial candidates will obtain a share\r\nof the grant: those schoolmasters who vote for opponents of the ministry\r\nwill apply for assistance in vain. Sir, the honourable Member never\r\nwould have made this objection if he had taken the trouble to understand\r\nthe minutes which he has condemned. We propose to place this part of\r\nthe public expenditure under checks which must make such abuses as the\r\nhonourable Member anticipates morally impossible. Not only will there\r\nbe those ordinary checks which are thought sufficient to prevent the\r\nmisapplication of the many millions annually granted for the army, the\r\nnavy, the ordnance, the civil government: not only must the Ministers of\r\nthe Crown come every year to this House for a vote, and be prepared to\r\nrender an account of the manner in which they have laid out what had\r\nbeen voted in the preceding year, but, when they have satisfied the\r\nHouse, when they have got their vote, they will still be unable to\r\ndistribute the money at their discretion. Whatever they may do for any\r\nschoolmaster must be done in concert with those persons who, in the\r\ndistrict where the schoolmaster lives, take an interest in education,\r\nand contribute out of their private means to the expense of education.\r\nWhen the honourable gentleman is afraid that we shall corrupt\r\nthe schoolmasters, he forgets, first, that we do not appoint the\r\nschoolmasters; secondly, that we cannot dismiss the schoolmasters;\r\nthirdly, that managers who are altogether independent of us can, without\r\nour consent, dismiss the schoolmasters; and, fourthly, that without\r\nthe recommendation of those managers we can give nothing to the\r\nschoolmasters. Observe, too, that such a recommendation will not be one\r\nof those recommendations which goodnatured easy people are too apt\r\nto give to everybody who asks; nor will it at all resemble those\r\nrecommendations which the Secretary of the Treasury is in the habit of\r\nreceiving. For every pound which we pay on the recommendation of the\r\nmanagers, the managers themselves must pay two pounds. They must also\r\nprovide the schoolmaster with a house out of their own funds before they\r\ncan obtain for him a grant from the public funds. What chance of jobbing\r\nis there here? It is common enough, no doubt, for a Member of Parliament\r\nwho votes with Government to ask that one of those who zealously\r\nsupported him at the last election may have a place in the Excise or\r\nthe Customs. But such a member would soon cease to solicit if the answer\r\nwere, \"Your friend shall have a place of fifty pounds a year, if you\r\nwill give him a house and settle on him an income of a hundred a year.\"\r\nWhat chance then, I again ask, is there of jobbing? What, say some of\r\nthe dissenters of Leeds, is to prevent a Tory Government, a High\r\nChurch Government, from using this parliamentary grant to corrupt\r\nthe schoolmasters of our borough, and to induce them to use all their\r\ninfluence in favour of a Tory and High Church candidate? Why, Sir, the\r\ndissenters of Leeds themselves have the power to prevent it. Let them\r\nsubscribe to the schools: let them take a share in the management of the\r\nschools: let them refuse to recommend to the committee of Council any\r\nschoolmaster whom they suspect of having voted at any election from\r\ncorrupt motives: and the thing is done. Our plan, in truth, is made\r\nup of checks. My only doubt is whether the checks may not be found too\r\nnumerous and too stringent. On our general conduct there is the ordinary\r\ncheck, the parliamentary check. And, as respects those minute details\r\nwhich it is impossible that this House can investigate, we shall be\r\nchecked, in every town and in every rural district, by boards consisting\r\nof independent men zealous in the cause of education.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, Sir, that those who clamour most loudly against our plan,\r\nhave never thought of ascertaining what it is. I see that a gentleman,\r\nwho ought to have known better, has not been ashamed publicly to tell\r\nthe world that our plan will cost the nation two millions a year, and\r\nwill paralyse all the exertions of individuals to educate the people.\r\nThese two assertions are uttered in one breath. And yet, if he who made\r\nthem had read our minutes before he railed at them, he would have\r\nseen that his predictions are contradictory; that they cannot both be\r\nfulfilled; that, if individuals do not exert themselves, the country\r\nwill have to pay nothing; and that, if the country has to pay two\r\nmillions, it will be because individuals have exerted themselves with\r\nsuch wonderful, such incredible vigour, as to raise four millions by\r\nvoluntary contributions.\r\n\r\nThe next objection made by the honourable Member for Finsbury is that we\r\nhave acted unconstitutionally, and have encroached on the functions of\r\nParliament. The Committee of Council he seems to consider as an unlawful\r\nassembly. He calls it sometimes a self-elected body and sometimes a\r\nself-appointed body. Sir, these are words without meaning. The Committee\r\nis no more a self-elected body than the Board of Trade. It is a body\r\nappointed by the Queen; and in appointing it Her Majesty has exercised,\r\nunder the advice of her responsible Ministers, a prerogative as old as\r\nthe monarchy. But, says the honourable Member, the constitutional course\r\nwould have been to apply for an Act of Parliament. On what ground?\r\nNothing but an Act of Parliament can legalise that which is illegal.\r\nBut whoever heard of an Act of Parliament to legalise what was already\r\nbeyond all dispute legal? Of course, if we wished to send aliens out\r\nof the country, or to retain disaffected persons in custody without\r\nbringing them to trial, we must obtain an Act of Parliament empowering\r\nus to do so. But why should we ask for an Act of Parliament to empower\r\nus to do what anybody may do, what the honourable Member for Finsbury\r\nmay do? Is there any doubt that he or anybody else may subscribe to a\r\nschool, give a stipend to a monitor, or settle a retiring pension on a\r\npreceptor who has done good service? What any of the Queen's subjects\r\nmay do the Queen may do. Suppose that her privy purse were so large that\r\nshe could afford to employ a hundred thousand pounds in this beneficent\r\nmanner; would an Act of Parliament be necessary to enable her to do so?\r\nEvery part of our plan may lawfully be carried into execution by any\r\nperson, Sovereign or subject, who has the inclination and the money.\r\nWe have not the money; and for the money we come, in a strictly\r\nconstitutional manner, to the House of Commons. The course which we\r\nhave taken is in conformity with all precedent, as well as with\r\nall principle. There are military schools. No Act of Parliament was\r\nnecessary to authorise the establishing of such schools. All that\r\nwas necessary was a grant of money to defray the charge. When I was\r\nSecretary at War it was my duty to bring under Her Majesty's notice the\r\nsituation of the female children of her soldiers. Many such children\r\naccompanied every regiment, and their education was grievously\r\nneglected. Her Majesty was graciously pleased to sign a warrant by which\r\na girls' school was attached to each corps. No Act of Parliament was\r\nnecessary. For to set up a school where girls might be taught to read,\r\nand write, and sew, and cook, was perfectly legal already. I might have\r\nset it up myself, if I had been rich enough. All that I had to ask from\r\nParliament was the money. But I ought to beg pardon for arguing a point\r\nso clear.\r\n\r\nThe next objection to our plans is that they interfere with the\r\nreligious convictions of Her Majesty's subjects. It has been sometimes\r\ninsinuated, but it has never been proved, that the Committee of Council\r\nhas shown undue favour to the Established Church. Sir, I have carefully\r\nread and considered the minutes; and I wish that every man who has\r\nexerted his eloquence against them had done the same. I say that I have\r\ncarefully read and considered them, and that they seem to me to have\r\nbeen drawn up with exemplary impartiality. The benefits which we offer\r\nwe offer to people of all religious persuasions alike. The dissenting\r\nmanagers of schools will have equal authority with the managers who\r\nbelong to the Church. A boy who goes to meeting will be just as eligible\r\nto be a monitor, and will receive just as large a stipend, as if he\r\nwent to the cathedral. The schoolmaster who is a nonconformist and the\r\nschoolmaster who is a conformist will enjoy the same emoluments, and\r\nwill, after the same term of service, obtain, on the same conditions,\r\nthe same retiring pension. I wish that some gentleman would, instead\r\nof using vague phrases about religious liberty and the rights of\r\nconscience, answer this plain question. Suppose that in one of our large\r\ntowns there are four schools, a school connected with the Church, a\r\nschool connected with the Independents, a Baptist school, and a Wesleyan\r\nschool; what encouragement, pecuniary or honorary, will, by our plan, be\r\ngiven to the school connected with the Church, and withheld from any of\r\nthe other three schools? Is it not indeed plain that, if by neglect or\r\nmaladministration the Church school should get into a bad state, while\r\nthe dissenting schools flourish, the dissenting schools will receive\r\npublic money and the Church school will receive none?\r\n\r\nIt is true, I admit, that in rural districts which are too poor to\r\nsupport more than one school, the religious community to which\r\nthe majority belongs will have an advantage over other religious\r\ncommunities. But this is not our fault. If we are as impartial as it\r\nis possible to be, you surely do not expect more. If there should be a\r\nparish containing nine hundred churchmen and a hundred dissenters, if\r\nthere should, in that parish, be a school connected with the Church,\r\nif the dissenters in that parish should be too poor to set up another\r\nschool, undoubtedly the school connected with the Church will, in that\r\nparish, get all that we give; and the dissenters will get nothing. But\r\nobserve that there is no partiality to the Church, as the Church, in\r\nthis arrangement. The churchmen get public money, not because they\r\nare churchmen, but because they are the majority. The dissenters get\r\nnothing, not because they are dissenters, but because they are a small\r\nminority. There are districts where the case will be reversed, where\r\nthere will be dissenting schools, and no Church schools. In such cases\r\nthe dissenters will get what we have to give, and the churchmen will get\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, I ought not to say that a churchman gets nothing by a system\r\nwhich gives a good education to dissenters, or that a dissenter gets\r\nnothing by a system which gives a good education to churchmen. We are\r\nnot, I hope, so much conformists, or so much nonconformists, as to\r\nforget that we are Englishmen and Christians. We all, Churchmen,\r\nPresbyterians, Independents, Baptists, Methodists, have an interest in\r\nthis, that the great body of the people should be rescued from ignorance\r\nand barbarism. I mentioned Lord George Gordon's mob. That mob began,\r\nit is true, with the Roman Catholics: but, long before the tumults were\r\nover, there was not a respectable Protestant in London who was not in\r\nfear for his house, for his limbs, for his life, for the lives of those\r\nwho were dearest to him. The honourable Member for Finsbury says that we\r\ncall on men to pay for an education from which they derive no benefit.\r\nI deny that there is one honest and industrious man in the country who\r\nderives no benefit from living among honest and industrious neighbours\r\nrather than among rioters and vagabonds. This matter is as much a matter\r\nof common concern as the defence of our coast. Suppose that I were\r\nto say, \"Why do you tax me to fortify Portsmouth? If the people of\r\nPortsmouth think that they cannot be safe without bastions and ravelins,\r\nlet the people of Portsmouth pay the engineers and masons. Why am I to\r\nbear the charge of works from which I derive no advantage?\" You would\r\nanswer, and most justly, that there is no man in the island who does\r\nnot derive advantage from these works, whether he resides within them or\r\nnot. And, as every man, in whatever part of the island he may live, is\r\nbound to contribute to the support of those arsenals which are necessary\r\nfor our common security, so is every man, to whatever sect he may\r\nbelong, bound to contribute to the support of those schools on which,\r\nnot less than on our arsenals, our common security depends.\r\n\r\nI now come to the last words of the amendment. The honourable Member\r\nfor Finsbury is apprehensive that our plan may interfere with the\r\ncivil rights of Her Majesty's subjects. How a man's civil rights can be\r\nprejudiced by his learning to read and write, to multiply and divide, or\r\neven by his obtaining some knowledge of history and geography, I do\r\nnot very well apprehend. One thing is clear, that persons sunk in that\r\nignorance in which, as we are assured by the Congregational Union, great\r\nnumbers of our countrymen are sunk, can be free only in name. It is\r\nhardly necessary for us to appoint a Select Committee for the purpose of\r\ninquiring whether knowledge be the ally or the enemy of liberty. He is,\r\nI must say, but a short-sighted friend of the common people who is eager\r\nto bestow on them a franchise which would make them all-powerful, and\r\nyet would withhold from them that instruction without which their power\r\nmust be a curse to themselves and to the State.\r\n\r\nThis, Sir, is my defence. From the clamour of our accusers I appeal with\r\nconfidence to the country to which we must, in no long time, render\r\nan account of our stewardship. I appeal with still more confidence\r\nto future generations, which, while enjoying all the blessings of an\r\nimpartial and efficient system of public instruction, will find it\r\ndifficult to believe that the authors of that system should have had\r\nto struggle with a vehement and pertinacious opposition, and still more\r\ndifficult to believe that such an opposition was offered in the name of\r\ncivil and religious freedom.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINAUGURAL SPEECH AT GLASGOW COLLEGE. (MARCH 21, 1849) A SPEECH DELIVERED\r\nAT THE COLLEGE OF GLASGOW ON THE 21ST OF MARCH, 1849.\r\n\r\nAt the election of Lord Rector of the University of Glasgow, in\r\nNovember, 1848, the votes stood thus: Mr Macaulay, 255; Colonel Mure,\r\n203. The installation took place on the twenty-first of March, 1849;\r\nand after that ceremony had been performed, the following Speech was\r\ndelivered.\r\n\r\nMy first duty, Gentlemen, is to return you my thanks for the honour\r\nwhich you have conferred on me. You well know that it was wholly\r\nunsolicited; and I can assure you that it was wholly unexpected. I\r\nmay add that, if I had been invited to become a candidate for your\r\nsuffrages, I should respectfully have declined the invitation. My\r\npredecessor, whom I am so happy as to be able to call my friend,\r\ndeclared from this place last year in language which well became him,\r\nthat he would not have come forward to displace so eminent a statesman\r\nas Lord John Russell. I can with equal truth affirm that I would\r\nnot have come forward to displace so estimable a gentleman and so\r\naccomplished a scholar as Colonel Mure. But Colonel Mure felt last\r\nyear that it was not for him, and I now feel that it is not for me,\r\nto question the propriety of your decision on a point of which, by the\r\nconstitution of your body, you are the judges. I therefore gratefully\r\naccept the office to which I have been called, fully purposing to use\r\nwhatever powers belong to it with a single view to the welfare and\r\ncredit of your society.\r\n\r\nI am not using a mere phrase of course, when I say that the feelings\r\nwith which I bear apart in the ceremony of this day are such as I find\r\nit difficult to utter in words. I do not think it strange that, when\r\nthat great master of eloquence, Edmund Burke, stood where I now stand,\r\nhe faltered and remained mute. Doubtless the multitude of thoughts which\r\nrushed into his mind was such as even he could not easily arrange or\r\nexpress. In truth there are few spectacles more striking or affecting\r\nthan that which a great historical place of education presents on a\r\nsolemn public day. There is something strangely interesting in the\r\ncontrast between the venerable antiquity of the body and the fresh and\r\nardent youth of the great majority of the members. Recollections and\r\nhopes crowd upon us together. The past and the future are at once\r\nbrought close to us. Our thoughts wander back to the time when the\r\nfoundations of this ancient building were laid, and forward to the\r\ntime when those whom it is our office to guide and to teach will be the\r\nguides and teachers of our posterity. On the present occasion we may,\r\nwith peculiar propriety, give such thoughts their course. For it has\r\nchanced that my magistracy has fallen on a great secular epoch. This\r\nis the four hundredth year of the existence of your University. At such\r\njubilees, jubilees of which no individual sees more than one, it is\r\nnatural, and it is good, that a society like this, a society which\r\nsurvives all the transitory parts of which it is composed, a society\r\nwhich has a corporate existence and a perpetual succession, should\r\nreview its annals, should retrace the stages of its growth from infancy\r\nto maturity, and should try to find, in the experience of generations\r\nwhich have passed away, lessons which may be profitable to generations\r\nyet unborn.\r\n\r\nThe retrospect is full of interest and instruction. Perhaps it may be\r\ndoubted whether, since the Christian era, there has been any point of\r\ntime more important to the highest interests of mankind than that at\r\nwhich the existence of your University commenced. It was at the moment\r\nof a great destruction and of a great creation. Your society was\r\ninstituted just before the empire of the East perished; that strange\r\nempire which, dragging on a languid life through the great age of\r\ndarkness, connected together the two great ages of light; that empire\r\nwhich, adding nothing to our stores of knowledge, and producing not one\r\nman great in letters, in science, or in art, yet preserved, in the midst\r\nof barbarism, those masterpieces of Attic genius, which the highest\r\nminds still contemplate, and long will contemplate, with admiring\r\ndespair. And at that very time, while the fanatical Moslem were\r\nplundering the churches and palaces of Constantinople, breaking in\r\npieces Grecian sculptures, and giving to the flames piles of Grecian\r\neloquence, a few humble German artisans, who little knew that they were\r\ncalling into existence a power far mightier than that of the victorious\r\nSultan, were busied in cutting and setting the first types. The\r\nUniversity came into existence just in time to witness the disappearance\r\nof the last trace of the Roman empire, and to witness the publication of\r\nthe earliest printed book.\r\n\r\nAt this conjuncture, a conjuncture of unrivalled interest in the history\r\nof letters, a man, never to be mentioned without reverence by every\r\nlover of letters, held the highest place in Europe. Our just attachment\r\nto that Protestant faith to which our country owes so much must not\r\nprevent us from paying the tribute which, on this occasion, and in this\r\nplace, justice and gratitude demand, to the founder of the University\r\nof Glasgow, the greatest of the restorers of learning, Pope Nicholas the\r\nFifth. He had sprung from the common people; but his abilities and his\r\nerudition had early attracted the notice of the great. He had studied\r\nmuch and travelled far. He had visited Britain, which, in wealth and\r\nrefinement, was to his native Tuscany what the back settlements of\r\nAmerica now are to Britain. He had lived with the merchant princes of\r\nFlorence, those men who first ennobled trade by making trade the ally\r\nof philosophy, of eloquence, and of taste. It was he who, under the\r\nprotection of the munificent and discerning Cosmo, arranged the first\r\npublic library that Modern Europe possessed. From privacy your founder\r\nrose to a throne; but on the throne he never forgot the studies which\r\nhad been his delight in privacy. He was the centre of an illustrious\r\ngroup, composed partly of the last great scholars of Greece, and partly\r\nof the first great scholars of Italy, Theodore Gaza and George\r\nof Trebizond, Bessarion and Filelfo, Marsilio Ficino and Poggio\r\nBracciolini. By him was founded the Vatican library, then and long after\r\nthe most precious and the most extensive collection of books in the\r\nworld. By him were carefully preserved the most valuable intellectual\r\ntreasures which had been snatched from the wreck of the Byzantine\r\nempire. His agents were to be found everywhere, in the bazaars of the\r\nfarthest East, in the monasteries of the farthest West, purchasing or\r\ncopying worm-eaten parchments, on which were traced words worthy of\r\nimmortality. Under his patronage were prepared accurate Latin versions\r\nof many precious remains of Greek poets and philosophers. But no\r\ndepartment of literature owes so much to him as history. By him were\r\nintroduced to the knowledge of Western Europe two great and unrivalled\r\nmodels of historical composition, the work of Herodotus and the work of\r\nThucydides. By him, too, our ancestors were first made acquainted with\r\nthe graceful and lucid simplicity of Xenophon and with the manly good\r\nsense of Polybius.\r\n\r\nIt was while he was occupied with cares like these that his attention\r\nwas called to the intellectual wants of this region, a region now\r\nswarming with population, rich with culture, and resounding with the\r\nclang of machinery, a region which now sends forth fleets laden with its\r\nadmirable fabrics to the lands of which, in his days, no geographer had\r\never heard, then a wild, a poor, a half barbarous tract, lying on the\r\nutmost verge of the known world. He gave his sanction to the plan of\r\nestablishing a University at Glasgow, and bestowed on the new seat of\r\nlearning all the privileges which belonged to the University of Bologna.\r\nI can conceive that a pitying smile passed over his face as he named\r\nBologna and Glasgow together. At Bologna he had long studied. No spot\r\nin the world had been more favoured by nature or by art. The surrounding\r\ncountry was a fruitful and sunny country, a country of cornfields and\r\nvineyards. In the city, the house of Bentivoglo bore rule, a house which\r\nvied with the house of Medici in taste and magnificence, which has\r\nleft to posterity noble palaces and temples, and which gave a splendid\r\npatronage to arts and letters. Glasgow your founder just knew to be a\r\npoor, a small, a rude town, a town, as he would have thought, not likely\r\never to be great and opulent; for the soil, compared with the rich\r\ncountry at the foot of the Apennines, was barren, and the climate was\r\nsuch that an Italian shuddered at the thought of it. But it is not on\r\nthe fertility of the soil, it is not on the mildness of the atmosphere,\r\nthat the prosperity of nations chiefly depends. Slavery and superstition\r\ncan make Campania a land of beggars, and can change the plain of Enna\r\ninto a desert. Nor is it beyond the power of human intelligence and\r\nenergy, developed by civil and spiritual freedom, to turn sterile rocks\r\nand pestilential marshes into cities and gardens. Enlightened as your\r\nfounder was, he little knew that he was himself a chief agent in a great\r\nrevolution, physical and moral, political and religious, in a revolution\r\ndestined to make the last first and the first last, in a revolution\r\ndestined to invert the relative positions of Glasgow and Bologna. We\r\ncannot, I think, better employ a few minutes than in reviewing the\r\nstages of this great change in human affairs.\r\n\r\nThe review shall be short. Indeed I cannot do better than pass rapidly\r\nfrom century to century. Look at the world, then, a hundred years after\r\nthe seal of Nicholas had been affixed to the instrument which\r\ncalled your College into existence. We find Europe, we find Scotland\r\nespecially, in the agonies of that great revolution which we\r\nemphatically call the Reformation. The liberal patronage which\r\nNicholas, and men like Nicholas, had given to learning, and of which\r\nthe establishment of this seat of learning is not the least remarkable\r\ninstance, had produced an effect which they had never contemplated.\r\nIgnorance was the talisman on which their power depended; and that\r\ntalisman they had themselves broken. They had called in Knowledge as a\r\nhandmaid to decorate Superstition, and their error produced its natural\r\neffect. I need not tell you what a part the votaries of classical\r\nlearning, and especially the votaries of Greek learning, the Humanists,\r\nas they were then called, bore in the great movement against spiritual\r\ntyranny. They formed, in fact, the vanguard of that movement. Every\r\none of the chief Reformers--I do not at this moment remember a single\r\nexception--was a Humanist. Almost every eminent Humanist in the north of\r\nEurope was, according to the measure of his uprightness and courage, a\r\nReformer. In a Scottish University I need hardly mention the names of\r\nKnox, of Buchanan, of Melville, of Secretary Maitland. In truth, minds\r\ndaily nourished with the best literature of Greece and Rome necessarily\r\ngrew too strong to be trammelled by the cobwebs of the scholastic\r\ndivinity; and the influence of such minds was now rapidly felt by the\r\nwhole community; for the invention of printing had brought books within\r\nthe reach even of yeomen and of artisans. From the Mediterranean to the\r\nFrozen Sea, therefore, the public mind was everywhere in a ferment; and\r\nnowhere was the ferment greater than in Scotland. It was in the midst\r\nof martyrdoms and proscriptions, in the midst of a war between power\r\nand truth, that the first century of the existence of your University\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\nPass another hundred years; and we are in the midst of another\r\nrevolution. The war between Popery and Protestantism had, in this\r\nisland, been terminated by the victory of Protestantism. But from that\r\nwar another war had sprung, the war between Prelacy and Puritanism.\r\nThe hostile religious sects were allied, intermingled, confounded with\r\nhostile political parties. The monarchical element of the constitution\r\nwas an object of almost exclusive devotion to the Prelatist. The popular\r\nelement of the constitution was especially dear to the Puritan. At\r\nlength an appeal was made to the sword. Puritanism triumphed; but\r\nPuritanism was already divided against itself. Independency and\r\nRepublicanism were on one side, Presbyterianism and limited Monarchy on\r\nthe other. It was in the very darkest part of that dark time, it was\r\nin the midst of battles, sieges, and executions, it was when the whole\r\nworld was still aghast at the awful spectacle of a British King standing\r\nbefore a judgment seat, and laying his neck on a block, it was when the\r\nmangled remains of the Duke of Hamilton had just been laid in the tomb\r\nof his house, it was when the head of the Marquess of Montrose had just\r\nbeen fixed on the Tolbooth of Edinburgh, that your University completed\r\nher second century.\r\n\r\nA hundred years more; and we have at length reached the beginning of a\r\nhappier period. Our civil and religious liberties had indeed been bought\r\nwith a fearful price. But they had been bought. The price had been\r\npaid. The last battle had been fought on British ground. The last black\r\nscaffold had been set up on Tower Hill. The evil days were over. A\r\nbright and tranquil century, a century of religious toleration, of\r\ndomestic peace, of temperate freedom, of equal justice, was beginning.\r\nThat century is now closing. When we compare it with any equally long\r\nperiod in the history of any other great society, we shall find abundant\r\ncause for thankfulness to the Giver of all good. Nor is there any place\r\nin the whole kingdom better fitted to excite this feeling than the place\r\nwhere we are now assembled. For in the whole kingdom we shall find no\r\ndistrict in which the progress of trade, of manufactures, of wealth,\r\nand of the arts of life, has been more rapid than in Clydesdale. Your\r\nUniversity has partaken largely of the prosperity of this city and of\r\nthe surrounding region. The security, the tranquillity, the liberty,\r\nwhich have been propitious to the industry of the merchant and of the\r\nmanufacturer, have been also propitious to the industry of the scholar.\r\nTo the last century belong most of the names of which you justly boast.\r\nThe time would fail me if I attempted to do justice to the memory of all\r\nthe illustrious men who, during that period, taught or learned wisdom\r\nwithin these ancient walls; geometricians, anatomists, jurists,\r\nphilologists, metaphysicians, poets: Simpson and Hunter, Millar and\r\nYoung, Reid and Stewart; Campbell, whose coffin was lately borne to a\r\ngrave in that renowned transept which contains the dust of Chaucer,\r\nof Spenser, and of Dryden; Black, whose discoveries form an era in the\r\nhistory of chemical science; Adam Smith, the greatest of all the masters\r\nof political science; James Watt, who perhaps did more than any single\r\nman has done, since the New Atlantis of Bacon was written, to accomplish\r\nthat glorious prophecy. We now speak the language of humility when we\r\nsay that the University of Glasgow need not fear a comparison with the\r\nUniversity of Bologna.\r\n\r\nA fifth secular period is about to commence. There is no lack of\r\nalarmists who will tell you that it is about to commence under evil\r\nauspices. But from me you must expect no such gloomy prognostications.\r\nI have heard them too long and too constantly to be scared by them. Ever\r\nsince I began to make observations on the state of my country, I have\r\nbeen seeing nothing but growth, and hearing of nothing but decay. The\r\nmore I contemplate our noble institutions, the more convinced I am that\r\nthey are sound at heart, that they have nothing of age but its dignity,\r\nand that their strength is still the strength of youth. The hurricane,\r\nwhich has recently overthrown so much that was great and that seemed\r\ndurable, has only proved their solidity. They still stand, august and\r\nimmovable, while dynasties and churches are lying in heaps of ruin all\r\naround us. I see no reason to doubt that, by the blessing of God on\r\na wise and temperate policy, on a policy of which the principle is\r\nto preserve what is good by reforming in time what is evil, our civil\r\ninstitutions may be preserved unimpaired to a late posterity, and that,\r\nunder the shade of our civil institutions, our academical institutions\r\nmay long continue to flourish.\r\n\r\nI trust, therefore, that, when a hundred years more have run out, this\r\nancient College will still continue to deserve well of our country and\r\nof mankind. I trust that the installation of 1949 will be attended by a\r\nstill greater assembly of students than I have the happiness now to see\r\nbefore me. That assemblage, indeed, may not meet in the place where we\r\nhave met. These venerable halls may have disappeared. My successor may\r\nspeak to your successors in a more stately edifice, in a edifice which,\r\neven among the magnificent buildings of the future Glasgow, will still\r\nbe admired as a fine specimen of the architecture which flourished in\r\nthe days of the good Queen Victoria. But, though the site and the walls\r\nmay be new, the spirit of the institution will, I hope, be still the\r\nsame. My successor will, I hope, be able to boast that the fifth century\r\nof the University has even been more glorious than the fourth. He will\r\nbe able to vindicate that boast by citing a long list of eminent men,\r\ngreat masters of experimental science, of ancient learning, of our\r\nnative eloquence, ornaments of the senate, the pulpit and the bar. He\r\nwill, I hope, mention with high honour some of my young friends who now\r\nhear me; and he will, I also hope, be able to add that their talents\r\nand learning were not wasted on selfish or ignoble objects, but were\r\nemployed to promote the physical and moral good of their species, to\r\nextend the empire of man over the material world, to defend the cause\r\nof civil and religious liberty against tyrants and bigots, and to defend\r\nthe cause of virtue and order against the enemies of all divine and\r\nhuman laws.\r\n\r\nI have now given utterance to a part, and to a part only, of the\r\nrecollections and anticipations of which, on this solemn occasion, my\r\nmind is full. I again thank you for the honour which you have bestowed\r\non me; and I assure you that, while I live, I shall never cease to take\r\na deep interest in the welfare and fame of the body with which, by your\r\nkindness, I have this day become connected.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRE-ELECTION TO PARLIAMENT. (NOVEMBER 2, 1852) A SPEECH DELIVERED AT\r\nEDINBURGH ON THE 2D OF NOVEMBER, 1852.\r\n\r\nAt the General Election of 1852 the votes for the City of Edinburgh\r\nstood thus:\r\n\r\n     Mr Macaulay ...............1872\r\n     Mr Cowan ..................1754\r\n     The Lord Provost ..........1559\r\n     Mr Bruce ..................1066\r\n     Mr Campbell ............... 686\r\n\r\nOn the second of November the Electors assembled in the Music Hall to\r\nmeet the representative whom they had, without any solicitation on his\r\npart, placed at the head of the poll. On this occasion the following\r\nSpeech was delivered.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,--I thank you from my heart for this kind reception. In truth,\r\nit has almost overcome me. Your good opinion and your good will were\r\nalways very valuable to me, far more valuable than any vulgar object\r\nof ambition, far more valuable than any office, however lucrative or\r\ndignified. In truth, no office, however lucrative or dignified, would\r\nhave tempted me to do what I have done at your summons, to leave\r\nagain the happiest and most tranquil of all retreats for the bustle\r\nof political life. But the honour which you have conferred upon me, an\r\nhonour of which the greatest men might well be proud, an honour which it\r\nis in the power only of a free people to bestow, has laid on me such\r\nan obligation that I should have thought it ingratitude, I should have\r\nthought it pusillanimity, not to make at least an effort to serve you.\r\n\r\nAnd here, Gentlemen, we meet again in kindness after a long separation.\r\nIt is more than five years since I last stood in this very place; a\r\nlarge part of human life. There are few of us on whom those five years\r\nhave not set their mark, few circles from which those five years have\r\nnot taken away what can never be replaced. Even in this multitude of\r\nfriendly faces I look in vain for some which would on this day have been\r\nlighted up with joy and kindness. I miss one venerable man, who, before\r\nI was born, in evil times, in times of oppression and of corruption,\r\nhad adhered, with almost solitary fidelity, to the cause of freedom, and\r\nwhom I knew in advanced age, but still in the full vigour of mind and\r\nbody, enjoying the respect and gratitude of his fellow citizens. I\r\nshould, indeed, be most ungrateful if I could, on this day, forget Sir\r\nJames Craig, his public spirit, his judicious counsel, his fatherly\r\nkindness to myself. And Jeffrey--with what an effusion of generous\r\naffection he would on this day, have welcomed me back to Edinburgh! He\r\ntoo is gone; but the remembrance of him is one of the many ties which\r\nbind me to the city once dear to his heart, and still inseparably\r\nassociated with his fame.\r\n\r\nBut, Gentlemen, it is not only here that, on entering again, at your\r\ncall, a path of life which I believed that I had quitted forever, I\r\nshall be painfully reminded of the changes which the last five years\r\nhave produced. In Parliament I shall look in vain for virtues which I\r\nloved, and for abilities which I admired. Often in debate, and never\r\nmore than when we discuss those questions of colonial policy which are\r\nevery day acquiring a new interest, I shall remember with regret how\r\nmuch eloquence and wit, how much acuteness and knowledge, how many\r\nengaging qualities, how many fair hopes, are buried in the grave of poor\r\nCharles Buller. There were other men, men with whom I had no political\r\nconnection and little personal connection, men to whom I was, during a\r\ngreat part of my public life, honestly opposed, but of whom I cannot\r\nnow think without grieving that their wisdom, their experience, and the\r\nweight of their great names can never more, in the hour of need, bring\r\nhelp to the nation or to the throne. Such were those two eminent men\r\nwhom I left at the height, one of civil, the other of military fame; one\r\nthe oracle of the House of Commons, the other the oracle of the House\r\nof Lords. There were parts of their long public life which they would\r\nthemselves, I am persuaded, on a calm retrospect, have allowed to be\r\njustly censurable. But it is impossible to deny that each in his own\r\ndepartment saved the State; that one brought to a triumphant close the\r\nmost formidable conflict in which this country was ever engaged with a\r\nforeign enemy; and that the other, at an immense sacrifice of personal\r\nfeeling and personal ambition, freed us from an odious monopoly, which\r\ncould not have existed many years longer without producing fearful\r\nintestine discords. I regret them both: but I peculiarly regret him who\r\nis associated in my mind with the place to which you have sent me. I\r\nshall hardly know the House of Commons without Sir Robert Peel. On the\r\nfirst evening on which I took my seat in that House, more than two and\r\ntwenty years ago, he held the highest position among the Ministers\r\nof the Crown who sate there. During all the subsequent years of my\r\nparliamentary service I scarcely remember one important discussion in\r\nwhich he did not bear a part with conspicuous ability. His figure is now\r\nbefore me: all the tones of his voice are in my ears; and the pain with\r\nwhich I think that I shall never hear them again would be embittered by\r\nthe recollection of some sharp encounters which took place between us,\r\nwere it not that at last there was an entire and cordial reconciliation,\r\nand that, only a very few days before his death, I had the pleasure of\r\nreceiving from him marks of kindness and esteem of which I shall always\r\ncherish the recollection.\r\n\r\nBut, Gentlemen, it is not only by those changes which the natural law of\r\nmortality produces, it is not only by the successive disappearances of\r\neminent men that the face of the world has been changed during the five\r\nyears which have elapsed since we met here last. Never since the origin\r\nof our race have there been five years more fertile of great events,\r\nfive years which have left behind them a more awful lesson. We have\r\nlived many lives in that time. The revolutions of ages have been\r\ncompressed into a few months. France, Germany, Hungary, Italy,--what\r\na history has theirs been! When we met here last, there was in all of\r\nthose countries an outward show of tranquillity; and there were few,\r\neven of the wisest among us, who imagined what wild passions, what wild\r\ntheories, were fermenting under that peaceful exterior. An obstinate\r\nresistance to a reasonable reform, a resistance prolonged but for\r\none day beyond the time, gave the signal for the explosion; and in an\r\ninstant, from the borders of Russia to the Atlantic Ocean, everything\r\nwas confusion and terror. The streets of the greatest capitals of Europe\r\nwere piled up with barricades, and were streaming with civil blood. The\r\nhouse of Orleans fled from France: the Pope fled from Rome: the Emperor\r\nof Austria was not safe at Vienna. There were popular institutions in\r\nFlorence; popular institutions at Naples. One democratic convention sat\r\nat Berlin; another democratic convention at Frankfort. You remember, I\r\nam sure, but too well, how some of the wisest and most honest friends of\r\nliberty, though inclined to look with great indulgence on the excesses\r\ninseparable from revolutions, began first to doubt and then to despair\r\nof the prospects of mankind. You remember how all sorts of animosity,\r\nnational, religious, and social, broke forth together. You remember\r\nhow with the hatred of discontented subjects to their governments was\r\nmingled the hatred of race to race and of class to class. For myself, I\r\nstood aghast; and though naturally of a sanguine disposition, I did for\r\none moment doubt whether the progress of society was not about to be\r\narrested, nay, to be suddenly and violently turned back; whether we\r\nwere not doomed to pass in one generation from the civilisation of the\r\nnineteenth century to the barbarism of the fifth. I remembered that Adam\r\nSmith and Gibbon had told us that the dark ages were gone, never more\r\nto return, that modern Europe was in no danger of the fate which had\r\nbefallen the Roman empire. That flood, they said, would no more return\r\nto cover the earth: and they seemed to reason justly: for they compared\r\nthe immense strength of the enlightened part of the world with the\r\nweakness of the part which remained savage; and they asked whence were\r\nto come the Huns and the Vandals, who should again destroy civilisation?\r\nIt had not occurred to them that civilisation itself might engender the\r\nbarbarians who should destroy it. It had not occurred to them that\r\nin the very heart of great capitals, in the neighbourhood of splendid\r\npalaces, and churches, and theatres, and libraries, and museums, vice\r\nand ignorance might produce a race of Huns fiercer than those who\r\nmarched under Attila, and of Vandals more bent on destruction than those\r\nwho followed Genseric. Such was the danger. It passed by. Civilisation\r\nwas saved, but at what a price! The tide of popular feeling turned and\r\nebbed almost as fast as it had risen. Imprudent and obstinate opposition\r\nto reasonable demands had brought on anarchy; and as soon as men had\r\na near view of anarchy they fled in terror to crouch at the feet of\r\ndespotism. To the dominion of mobs armed with pikes succeeded the\r\nsterner and more lasting dominion of disciplined armies. The Papacy\r\nrose from its debasement; rose more intolerant and insolent than before;\r\nintolerant and insolent as in the days of Hildebrand; intolerant and\r\ninsolent to a degree which dismayed and disappointed those who had\r\nfondly cherished the hope that the spirit which had animated the\r\nCrusaders and the Inquisitors had been mitigated by the lapse of years\r\nand by the progress of knowledge. Through all that vast region, where\r\nlittle more than four years ago we looked in vain for any stable\r\nauthority, we now look in vain for any trace of constitutional freedom.\r\nAnd we, Gentlemen, in the meantime, have been exempt from both those\r\ncalamities which have wrought ruin all around us. The madness of 1848\r\ndid not subvert the British throne. The reaction which followed has not\r\ndestroyed British liberty.\r\n\r\nAnd why is this? Why has our country, with all the ten plagues raging\r\naround her, been a land of Goshen? Everywhere else was the thunder and\r\nthe fire running along the ground,--a very grievous storm,--a storm such\r\nas there was none like it since man was on the earth; yet everything\r\ntranquil here; and then again thick night, darkness that might be felt;\r\nand yet light in all our dwellings. We owe this singular happiness,\r\nunder the blessing of God, to a wise and noble constitution, the work of\r\nmany generations of great men. Let us profit by experience; and let us\r\nbe thankful that we profit by the experience of others, and not by our\r\nown. Let us prize our constitution: let us purify it: let us amend it;\r\nbut let us not destroy it. Let us shun extremes, not only because each\r\nextreme is in itself a positive evil, but also because each extreme\r\nnecessarily engenders its opposite. If we love civil and religious\r\nfreedom, let us in the day of danger uphold law and order. If we are\r\nzealous for law and order, let us prize, as the best safeguard of law\r\nand order, civil and religious freedom.\r\n\r\nYes, Gentlemen; if I am asked why we are free with servitude all around\r\nus, why our Habeas Corpus Act has not been suspended, why our press\r\nis still subject to no censor, why we still have the liberty of\r\nassociation, why our representative institutions still abide in all\r\ntheir strength, I answer, It is because in the year of revolutions we\r\nstood firmly by our Government in its peril; and, if I am asked why\r\nwe stood by our Government in its peril, when men all around us were\r\nengaged in pulling Governments down, I answer, It was because we knew\r\nthat though our Government was not a perfect Government, it was a good\r\nGovernment, that its faults admitted of peaceable and legal remedies,\r\nthat it had never inflexibly opposed just demands, that we had obtained\r\nconcessions of inestimable value, not by beating the drum, not by\r\nringing the tocsin, not by tearing up the pavement, not by running to\r\nthe gunsmiths' shops to search for arms, but by the mere force of reason\r\nand public opinion. And, Gentlemen, preeminent among those pacific\r\nvictories of reason and public opinion, the recollection of which\r\nchiefly, I believe, carried us safely through the year of revolutions\r\nand through the year of counter-revolutions, I would place two great\r\nreforms, inseparably associated, one with the memory of an illustrious\r\nman, who is now beyond the reach of envy, the other with the name of\r\nanother illustrious man, who is still, and, I hope, long will be, a\r\nliving mark for distinction. I speak of the great commercial reform of\r\n1846, the work of Sir Robert Peel, and of the great parliamentary reform\r\nof 1832, the work of many eminent statesmen, among whom none was more\r\nconspicuous than Lord John Russell. I particularly call your attention\r\nto those two great reforms, because it will, in my opinion, be the\r\nespecial duty of that House of Commons in which, by your distinguished\r\nfavour, I have a seat, to defend the commercial reform of Sir Robert\r\nPeel, and to perfect and extend the parliamentary reform of Lord John\r\nRussell.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the commercial reform, though I say it will be a sacred\r\nduty to defend it, I do not apprehend that we shall find the task very\r\ndifficult. Indeed, I doubt whether we have any reason to apprehend a\r\ndirect attack upon the system now established. From the expressions used\r\nduring the last session, and during the late elections, by the Ministers\r\nand their adherents, I should, I confess, find it utterly impossible to\r\ndraw any inference whatever. They have contradicted each other; and they\r\nhave contradicted themselves. Nothing would be easier than to select\r\nfrom their speeches passages which would prove them to be Freetraders,\r\nand passages which would prove them to be protectionists. But, in truth,\r\nthe only inference which can properly be drawn from a speech of one of\r\nthese gentlemen in favour of Free Trade is, that, when he spoke, he was\r\nstanding for a town; and the only inference which can be drawn from the\r\nspeech of another in favour of Protection is, that, when he spoke,\r\nhe was standing for a county. I quitted London in the heat of the\r\nelections. I left behind me a Tory candidate for Westminster and a Tory\r\ncandidate for Middlesex, loudly proclaiming themselves Derbyites and\r\nFreetraders. All along my journey through Berkshire and Wiltshire I\r\nheard nothing but the cry of Derby and Protection; but when I got to\r\nBristol, the cry was Derby and Free Trade again. On one side of the\r\nWash, Lord Stanley, the Under-Secretary of State for the Foreign\r\nDepartment, a young nobleman of great promise, a young nobleman who\r\nappears to me to inherit a large portion of his father's ability and\r\nenergy, held language which was universally understood to indicate that\r\nthe Government had altogether abandoned all thought of Protection. Lord\r\nStanley was addressing the inhabitants of a town. Meanwhile, on the\r\nother side of the Wash, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster was\r\nharanguing the farmers of Lincolnshire; and, when somebody took it upon\r\nhim to ask, \"What will you do, Mr Christopher, if Lord Derby abandons\r\nProtection?\" the Chancellor of the Duchy refused to answer a question so\r\nmonstrous, so insulting to Lord Derby. \"I will stand by Lord Derby,\" he\r\nsaid, \"because I know that Lord Derby will stand by Protection.\" Well,\r\nthese opposite declarations of two eminent persons, both likely to know\r\nthe mind of Lord Derby on the subject, go forth, and are taken up\r\nby less distinguished adherents of the party. The Tory candidate for\r\nLeicestershire says, \"I put faith in Mr Christopher: while you see Mr\r\nChristopher in the Government, you may be assured that agriculture will\r\nbe protected.\" But, in East Surrey, which is really a suburb of London,\r\nI find the Tory candidate saying, \"Never mind Mr Christopher. I trust to\r\nLord Stanley. What should Mr Christopher know on the subject? He is not\r\nin the Cabinet: he can tell you nothing about it.\" Nay, these tactics\r\nwere carried so far that Tories who had formerly been for Free Trade,\r\nturned Protectionists if they stood for counties; and Tories, who had\r\nalways been furious Protectionists, declared for Free Trade, without\r\nscruple or shame, if they stood for large towns. Take for example\r\nLord Maidstone. He was once one of the most vehement Protectionists\r\nin England, and put forth a small volume, which, as I am an elector of\r\nWestminster, and as he was a candidate for Westminster, I thought it my\r\nduty to buy, in order to understand his opinions. It is entitled Free\r\nTrade Hexameters. Of the poetical merits of Lord Maidstone's hexameters\r\nI shall not presume to give an opinion. You may all form an opinion for\r\nyourselves by ordering copies. They may easily be procured: for I was\r\nassured, when I bought mine in Bond Street, that the supply on hand\r\nwas still considerable. But of the political merits of Lord Maidstone's\r\nhexameters I can speak with confidence; and it is impossible to\r\nconceive a fiercer attack, according to the measure of the power of\r\nthe assailant, than that which his lordship made on Sir Robert Peel's\r\npolicy. On the other hand, Sir Fitzroy Kelly, who is now Solicitor\r\nGeneral, and who was Solicitor General under Sir Robert Peel, voted\r\nsteadily with Sir Robert Peel, doubtless from a regard to the public\r\ninterest, which would have suffered greatly by the retirement of so able\r\na lawyer from the service of the Crown. Sir Fitzroy did not think it\r\nnecessary to lay down his office even when Sir Robert Peel brought in\r\nthe bill which established a free trade in corn. But unfortunately,\r\nLord Maidstone becomes a candidate for the City of Westminster, and Sir\r\nFitzroy Kelly stands for an agricultural county. Instantly, therefore,\r\nLord Maidstone forgets his verses, and Sir Fitzroy Kelly forgets his\r\nvotes. Lord Maidstone declares himself a convert to the opinions of Sir\r\nRobert Peel; and Sir Robert Peel's own Solicitor General lifts up his\r\nhead intrepidly, and makes a speech, apparently composed out of Lord\r\nMaidstone's hexameters.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore, Gentlemen, utterly impossible for me to pretend to\r\ninfer, from the language held by the members of the Government,\r\nand their adherents, what course they will take on the subject of\r\nProtection. Nevertheless, I confidently say that the system established\r\nby Sir Robert Peel is perfectly safe. The law which repealed the Corn\r\nLaws stands now on a much firmer foundation than when it was first\r\npassed. We are stronger than ever in reason; and we are stronger than\r\never in numbers. We are stronger than ever in reason, because what was\r\nonly prophecy is now history. No person can now question the salutary\r\neffect which the repeal of the Corn Laws has had on our trade and\r\nindustry. We are stronger than ever in numbers. You, I am sure,\r\nrecollect the time when a formidable opposition to the repeal of the\r\nCorn Laws was made by a class which was most deeply interested in that\r\nrepeal; I mean the labouring classes. You recollect that, in many large\r\ntowns, ten years ago, the friends of Free Trade could not venture to\r\ncall meetings for the purpose of petitioning against the Corn Laws, for\r\nfear of being interrupted by a crowd of working people, who had been\r\ntaught by a certain class of demagogues to say that the question was\r\none in which working people had no interest, that it was purely a\r\ncapitalist's question, that, if the poor man got a large loaf instead of\r\na small one, he would get from the capitalist only a sixpence instead\r\nof a shilling. I never had the slightest faith in those doctrines.\r\nExperience even then seemed to me completely to confute them. I compared\r\nplace with place; and I found that, though bread was dearer in England\r\nthan in Ohio, wages were higher in Ohio than in England. I compared\r\ntime with time; and I saw that those times when bread was cheapest\r\nin England, within my own memory, were also the times in which the\r\ncondition of the labouring classes was the happiest. But now the\r\nexperiment has been tried in a manner which admits of no dispute. I\r\nshould be glad to know, if there were now an attempt made to impose a\r\ntax on corn, what demagogue would be able to bring a crowd of working\r\nmen to hold up their hands in favour of such a tax. Thus strong,\r\nGentlemen, in reason, and thus strong in numbers, we need, I believe,\r\napprehend no direct attack on the principles of Free Trade. It will,\r\nhowever, be one of the first duties of your representatives to be\r\nvigilant that no indirect attack shall be made on these principles; and\r\nto take care that in our financial arrangements no undue favour shall be\r\nshown to any class.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the other question which I have mentioned, the question\r\nof Parliamentary Reform, I think that the time is at hand when that\r\nquestion will require the gravest consideration, when it will be\r\nnecessary to reconsider the Reform Act of 1832, and to amend it\r\ntemperately and cautiously, but in a large and liberal spirit. I confess\r\nthat, in my opinion, this revision cannot be made with advantage, except\r\nby the Ministers of the Crown. I greatly doubt whether it will be found\r\npossible to carry through any plan of improvement if we have not the\r\nGovernment heartily with us; and I must say that from the present\r\nAdministration I can, as to that matter, expect nothing good. What\r\nprecisely I am to expect from them I do not know, whether the most\r\nobstinate opposition to every change, or the most insanely violent\r\nchange. If I look to their conduct, I find the gravest reasons for\r\napprehending that they may at one time resist the most just demands,\r\nand at another time, from the merest caprice, propose the wildest\r\ninnovations. And I will tell you why I entertain this opinion. I am\r\nsorry that, in doing so, I must mention the name of a gentleman for\r\nwhom, personally, I have the highest respect; I mean Mr Walpole, the\r\nSecretary of State for the Home Department. My own acquaintance with him\r\nis slight; but I know him well by character; and I believe him to be\r\nan honourable, an excellent, an able man. No man is more esteemed in\r\nprivate life: but of his public conduct I must claim the right to speak\r\nwith freedom; and I do so with the less scruple because he has himself\r\nset me an example of that freedom, and because I am really now standing\r\non the defensive. Mr Walpole lately made a speech to the electors of\r\nMidhurst; and in that speech he spoke personally of Lord John Russell\r\nas one honourable man should speak of another, and as, I am sure, I\r\nwish always to speak of Mr Walpole. But in Lord John's public conduct Mr\r\nWalpole found many faults. Chief among those faults was this, that\r\nhis lordship had re-opened the question of reform. Mr Walpole declared\r\nhimself to be opposed on principle to organic change. He justly said\r\nthat if, unfortunately, organic change should be necessary, whatever\r\nwas done ought to be done with much deliberation and with caution almost\r\ntimorous; and he charged Lord John with having neglected these plain\r\nrules of prudence. I was perfectly thunderstruck when I read the speech:\r\nfor I could not but recollect that the most violent and democratic\r\nchange that ever was proposed within the memory of the oldest man had\r\nbeen proposed but a few weeks before by this same Mr Walpole, as the\r\norgan of the present Government. Do you remember the history of the\r\nMilitia Bill? In general, when a great change in our institutions is\r\nto be proposed from the Treasury Bench, the Minister announces his\r\nintention some weeks before. There is a great attendance: there is\r\nthe most painful anxiety to know what he is going to recommend. I well\r\nremember,--for I was present,--with what breathless suspense six hundred\r\npersons waited, on the first of March, 1831, to hear Lord John Russell\r\nexplain the principles of his Reform Bill. But what was his Reform Bill\r\nto the Reform Bill of the Derby Administration? At the end of a night,\r\nin the coolest way possible, without the smallest notice, Mr Walpole\r\nproposed to add to the tail of the Militia Bill a clause to the effect,\r\nthat every man who had served in the militia for two years should have\r\na vote for the county. What is the number of those voters who were to be\r\nentitled to vote in this way for counties? The militia of England is to\r\nconsist of eighty thousand men; and the term of service is to be five\r\nyears. In ten years the number will be one hundred and sixty thousand;\r\nin twenty years, three hundred and twenty thousand; and in twenty-five\r\nyears, four hundred thousand. Some of these new electors will, of\r\ncourse, die off in twenty-five years, though the lives are picked lives,\r\nremarkably good lives. What the mortality is likely to be I do not\r\naccurately know; but any actuary will easily calculate it for you. I\r\nshould say, in round numbers, that you will have, when the system has\r\nbeen in operation for a generation, an addition of about three hundred\r\nthousand to the county constituent bodies; that is to say, six thousand\r\nvoters on the average will be added to every county in England\r\nand Wales. That is surely an immense addition. And what is the\r\nqualification? Why, the first qualification is youth. These electors\r\nare not to be above a certain age; but the nearer you can get them to\r\neighteen the better. The second qualification is poverty. The elector\r\nis to be a person to whom a shilling a-day is an object. The third\r\nqualification is ignorance; for I venture to say that, if you take the\r\ntrouble to observe the appearance of those young fellows who follow the\r\nrecruiting sergeant in the streets, you will at once say that, among our\r\nlabouring classes, they are not the most educated, they are not the\r\nmost intelligent. That they are brave, stout lads, I fully believe. Lord\r\nHardinge tells me that he never saw a finer set of young men; and I have\r\nnot the slightest doubt that, if necessary, after a few weeks' training,\r\nthey will be found standing up for our firesides against the best\r\ndisciplined soldiers that the Continent can produce. But these are not\r\nthe qualifications which fit men to choose legislators. A young man who\r\ngoes from the ploughtail into the army is generally rather thoughtless\r\nand disposed to idleness. Oh! but there is another qualification which I\r\nhad forgotten: the voter must be five feet two. There is a qualification\r\nfor you! Only think of measuring a man for the franchise! And this is\r\nthe work of a Conservative Government, this plan which would swamp all\r\nthe counties in England with electors who possess the Derby-Walpole\r\nqualifications; that is to say, youth, poverty, ignorance, a roving\r\ndisposition, and five feet two. Why, what right have people who have\r\nproposed such a change as this to talk about--I do not say Lord John\r\nRussell's imprudence--but the imprudence of Ernest Jones or of any other\r\nChartist? The Chartists, to do them justice, would give the franchise to\r\nwealth as well as to poverty, to knowledge as well as to ignorance, to\r\nmature age as well as to youth. But to make a qualification compounded\r\nof disqualifications is a feat of which the whole glory belongs to our\r\nConservative rulers. This astounding proposition was made, I believe, in\r\na very thin House: but the next day the House was full enough, everybody\r\nhaving come down to know what was going to happen. One asked, why not\r\nthis? and another, why not that? Are all the regular troops to have\r\nthe franchise? all the policemen? all the sailors? for, if you give the\r\nfranchise to ploughboys of twenty-one, what class of honest Englishmen\r\nand Scotchmen can you with decency exclude? But up gets the Home\r\nSecretary, and informs the House that the plan had not been sufficiently\r\nconsidered, that some of his colleagues were not satisfied, and that\r\nhe would not press his proposition. Now, if it had happened to me to\r\npropose such a reform at one sitting of the House, and at the next\r\nsitting to withdraw it, because it had not been well considered, I do\r\nthink that, to the end of my life, I never should have talked about the\r\nexceeding imprudence of reopening the question of reform; I should never\r\nhave ventured to read any other man a lecture about the caution with\r\nwhich all plans of organic change ought to be framed. I repeat that,\r\nif I am to judge from the language of the present Ministers, taken in\r\nconnection with this solitary instance of their legislative skill in the\r\nway of reform, I am utterly at a loss what to expect. On the whole, what\r\nI do expect is that they will offer a pertinacious, vehement, provoking\r\nopposition to safe and reasonable change, and that then, in some moment\r\nof fear or caprice, they will bring in, and fling on the table, in a\r\nfit of desperation or levity, some plan which will loosen the very\r\nfoundations of society.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I think that the question of Parliamentary Reform is\r\none which must soon be taken up; but it ought to be taken up by the\r\nGovernment; and I hope, before long, to see in office a Ministry which\r\nwill take it up in earnest. I dare say that you will not suspect me of\r\nsaying so from any interested feeling. In no case whatever shall I again\r\nbe a member of any Ministry. During what may remain of my public life,\r\nI shall be the servant of none but you. I have nothing to ask of any\r\ngovernment, except that protection which every government owes to a\r\nfaithful and loyal subject of the Queen. But I do hope to see in office\r\nbefore long a Ministry which will treat this great question as it\r\nshould be treated. It will be the duty of that Ministry to revise the\r\ndistribution of power. It will be the duty of that Ministry to consider\r\nwhether small constituent bodies, notoriously corrupt, and proved to\r\nbe corrupt, such, for example, as Harwich, ought to retain the power of\r\nsending members to Parliament. It will be the duty of such a Ministry\r\nto consider whether small constituent bodies, even less notoriously\r\ncorrupt, ought to have, in the counsels of the empire, a share as great\r\nas that of the West Riding of York, and twice as great as that of the\r\ncounty of Perth. It will be the duty of such a Ministry to consider\r\nwhether it may not be possible, without the smallest danger to peace,\r\nlaw, and order, to extend the elective franchise to classes of the\r\ncommunity which do not now possess it. As to universal suffrage, on that\r\nsubject you already know my opinions; and I now come before you with\r\nthose opinions strengthened by everything which, since I last professed\r\nthem, has passed in Europe. We now know, by the clearest of all proofs,\r\nthat universal suffrage, even united with secret voting, is no security\r\nagainst the establishment of arbitrary power. But, Gentlemen, I do look\r\nforward, and at no very remote period, to an extension of the franchise,\r\nsuch as I once thought unsafe. I believe that such an extension will,\r\nby the course of events, be brought about in the very best and happiest\r\nway. Perhaps I may be sanguine: but I think that good times are coming\r\nfor the labouring classes of this country. I do not entertain that hope\r\nbecause I expect that Fourierism, or Saint Simonianism, or Socialism, or\r\nany of those other \"isms\" for which the plain English word is \"robbery,\"\r\nwill prevail. I know that such schemes only aggravate the misery which\r\nthey pretend to relieve. I know that it is possible, by legislation, to\r\nmake the rich poor, but that it is utterly impossible to make the poor\r\nrich. But I believe that the progress of experimental science, the\r\nfree intercourse of nation with nation, the unrestricted influx of\r\ncommodities from countries where they are cheap, and the unrestricted\r\nefflux of labour towards countries where it is dear, will soon produce,\r\nnay, I believe that they are beginning to produce, a great and most\r\nblessed social revolution. I need not tell you, Gentlemen, that in those\r\ncolonies which have been planted by our race,--and, when I speak of our\r\ncolonies I speak as well of those which have separated from us as of\r\nthose which still remain united to us,--I need not tell you that in\r\nour colonies the condition of the labouring man has long been far more\r\nprosperous than in any part of the Old World. And why is this? Some\r\npeople tell you that the inhabitants of Pennsylvania and New England\r\nare better off than the inhabitants of the Old World, because the\r\nUnited States have a republican form of government. But we know that the\r\ninhabitants of Pennsylvania and New England were more prosperous than\r\nthe inhabitants of the Old World when Pennsylvania and New England were\r\nas loyal as any part of the dominions of George the First, George the\r\nSecond, and George the Third; and we know that in Van Diemen's Land, in\r\nNew Zealand, in Australasia, in New Brunswick, in Canada, the subjects\r\nof Her Majesty are as prosperous as they could be under the government\r\nof a President. The real cause is that, in these new countries, where\r\nthere is a boundless extent of fertile land, nothing is easier than for\r\nthe labourer to pass from the place which is overstocked with labour to\r\nthe place which is understocked; and that thus both he who moves and he\r\nwho stays always have enough. This it is which keeps up the prosperity\r\nof the Atlantic States of the Union. They pour their population back to\r\nthe Ohio, across the Ohio to the Mississippi, and beyond the Mississippi\r\nto the Rocky Mountains. Everywhere the desert is receding before the\r\nadvancing flood of human life and civilisation; and, in the meantime,\r\nthose who are left behind enjoy abundance, and never endure such\r\nprivations as in old countries too often befall the labouring classes.\r\nAnd why has not the condition of our labourers been equally fortunate?\r\nSimply, as I believe, on account of the great distance which separates\r\nour country from the new and unoccupied part of the world, and on\r\naccount of the expense of traversing that distance. Science, however,\r\nhas abridged, and is abridging, that distance: science has diminished,\r\nand is diminishing, that expense. Already New Zealand is, for all\r\npractical purposes, nearer to us than New England was to the Puritans\r\nwho fled thither from the tyranny of Laud. Already the ports of North\r\nAmerica, Halifax, Boston, and New York, are nearer to us than, within\r\nthe memory of persons now living, the Island of Skye and the county of\r\nDonegal were to London. Already emigration is beginning to produce the\r\nsame effect here which it has produced on the Atlantic States of\r\nthe Union. And do not imagine that our countryman who goes abroad is\r\naltogether lost to us. Even if he goes from under the dominion of the\r\nBritish Queen and the protection of the British flag he will still,\r\nunder the benignant system of free trade, continue to be bound to us by\r\nclose ties. If he ceases to be a neighbour, he is still a benefactor\r\nand a customer. Go where he may, if you will but maintain that system\r\ninviolate, it is for us that he is turning the forests into cornfields\r\non the banks of the Mississippi; it is for us that he is tending his\r\nsheep and preparing his fleeces in the heart of Australasia; and in\r\nthe meantime it is from us that he receives those commodities which are\r\nproduced with most advantage in old societies, where great masses of\r\ncapital have been accumulated. His candlesticks and his pots and his\r\npans come from Birmingham; his knives from Sheffield; the light cotton\r\njacket which he wears in summer from Manchester; the good cloth coat\r\nwhich he wears in winter from Leeds; and in return he sends us back,\r\nfrom what was lately a wilderness, the good flour out of which is made\r\nthe large loaf which the British labourer divides among his children. I\r\nbelieve that it is in these changes that we shall see the best solution\r\nof the question of the franchise. We shall make our institutions more\r\ndemocratic than they are, not by lowering the franchise to the level of\r\nthe great mass of the community, but by raising, in a time which will be\r\nvery short when compared with the existence of a nation, the great mass\r\nup to the level of the franchise.\r\n\r\nI feel that I must stop. I had meant to advert to some other subjects.\r\nI had meant to say something about the ballot, to which, as you know, I\r\nhave always been favourable; something about triennial parliaments, to\r\nwhich, as you know, I have always been honestly opposed; something about\r\nyour university tests; something about the cry for religious equality\r\nwhich has lately been raised in Ireland; but I feel that I cannot well\r\nproceed. I have only strength to thank you again, from the very bottom\r\nof my heart, for the great honour which you have done me in choosing me,\r\nwithout solicitation, to represent you in Parliament. I am proud of our\r\nconnection; and I shall try to act in such a manner that you may not be\r\nashamed of it.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXCLUSION OF JUDGES FROM THE HOUSE OF COMMONS. (JUNE 1, 1853) A SPEECH\r\nDELIVERED IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS ON THE 1ST OF JUNE 1853.\r\n\r\nOn the first of June 1853, Lord Hotham, Member for Kent, moved the third\r\nreading of a bill of which the chief object was to make the Master\r\nof the Rolls incapable of sitting in the House of Commons. Mr Henry\r\nDrummond, Member for Surrey, moved that the bill should be read a third\r\ntime that day six months. In support of Mr Drummond's amendment the\r\nfollowing Speech was made.\r\n\r\nThe amendment was carried by 224 votes to 123.\r\n\r\nI cannot, Sir, suffer the House to proceed to a division without\r\nexpressing the very strong opinion which I have formed on this subject.\r\nI shall give my vote, with all my heart and soul, for the amendment\r\nmoved by my honourable friend the Member for Surrey. I never gave a vote\r\nin my life with a more entire confidence that I was in the right; and I\r\ncannot but think it discreditable to us that a bill for which there is\r\nso little to be said, and against which there is so much to be said,\r\nshould have been permitted to pass through so many stages without a\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\nOn what grounds, Sir, does the noble lord, the Member for Kent, ask\r\nus to make this change in the law? The only ground, surely, on which\r\na Conservative legislator ought ever to propose a change in the law is\r\nthis, that the law, as it stands, has produced some evil. Is it then\r\npretended that the law, as it stands, has produced any evil? The noble\r\nlord himself tells you that it has produced no evil whatever. Nor can\r\nit be said that the experiment has not been fairly tried. This House and\r\nthe office of Master of the Rolls began to exist, probably in the same\r\ngeneration, certainly in the same century. During six hundred years this\r\nHouse has been open to Masters of the Rolls. Many Masters of the Rolls\r\nhave sate here, and have taken part, with great ability and authority,\r\nin our deliberations. To go no further back than the accession of the\r\nHouse of Hanover, Jekyll was a member of this House, and Strange, and\r\nKenyon, and Pepper Arden, and Sir William Grant, and Sir John Copley,\r\nand Sir Charles Pepys, and finally Sir John Romilly. It is not even\r\npretended that any one of these eminent persons was ever, on any single\r\noccasion, found to be the worse member of this House for being Master of\r\nthe Rolls, or the worse Master of the Rolls for being a member of this\r\nHouse. And if so, is it, I ask, the part of a wise statesman, is it, I\r\nask still more emphatically, the part of a Conservative statesman, to\r\nalter a system which has lasted six centuries, and which has never\r\nonce, during all those centuries, produced any but good effects, merely\r\nbecause it is not in harmony with an abstract principle?\r\n\r\nAnd what is the abstract principle for the sake of which we are asked to\r\ninnovate in reckless defiance of all the teaching of experience? It is\r\nthis; that political functions ought to be kept distinct from judicial\r\nfunctions. So sacred, it seems, is this principle, that the union of the\r\npolitical and judicial characters ought not to be suffered to continue\r\neven in a case in which that union has lasted through many ages without\r\nproducing the smallest practical inconvenience. \"Nothing is so hateful,\"\r\nI quote the words of the noble lord who brought in this bill, \"nothing\r\nis so hateful as a political judge.\"\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, if I assent to the principle laid down by the noble lord, I\r\nmust pronounce his bill the most imbecile, the most pitiful, attempt at\r\nreform that ever was made. The noble lord is a homoeopathist in state\r\nmedicine. His remedies are administered in infinitesimal doses. If he\r\nwill, for a moment, consider how our tribunals are constituted, and how\r\nour parliament is constituted, he will perceive that the judicial\r\nand political character are, through all grades, everywhere combined,\r\neverywhere interwoven, and that therefore the evil which he proposes\r\nto remove vanishes, as the mathematicians say, when compared with the\r\nimmense mass of evil which he leaves behind.\r\n\r\nIt has been asked, and very sensibly asked, why, if you exclude the\r\nMaster of the Rolls from the House, you should not also exclude the\r\nRecorder of the City of London. I should be very sorry to see the\r\nRecorder of the City of London excluded. But I must say that the reasons\r\nfor excluding him are ten times as strong as the reasons for excluding\r\nthe Master of the Rolls. For it is well-known that political cases\r\nof the highest importance have been tried by Recorders of the City of\r\nLondon. But why not exclude all Recorders, and all Chairmen of Quarter\r\nSessions? I venture to say that there are far stronger reasons for\r\nexcluding a Chairman of Quarter Sessions than for excluding a Master of\r\nthe Rolls. I long ago attended, during two or three years, the Quarter\r\nSessions of a great county. There I constantly saw in the chair an\r\neminent member of this House. An excellent criminal judge he was. Had\r\nhe been a veteran lawyer, he could hardly have tried causes more\r\nsatisfactorily or more expeditiously. But he was a keen politician: he\r\nhad made a motion which had turned out a Government; and when he died\r\nhe was a Cabinet Minister. Yet this gentleman, the head of the Blue\r\ninterest, as it was called, in his county, might have had to try men of\r\nthe Orange party for rioting at a contested election. He voted for the\r\ncorn laws; and he might have had to try men for breaches of the peace\r\nwhich had originated in the discontent caused by the corn laws. He was,\r\nas I well remember, hooted, and, I rather think, pelted too, by the mob\r\nof London for his conduct towards Queen Caroline; and, when he went\r\ndown to his county, he might have had to sit in judgment on people\r\nfor breaking windows which had not been illuminated in honour of Her\r\nMajesty's victory. This is not a solitary instance. There are, I dare\r\nsay, in this House, fifty Chairmen of Quarter Sessions. And this is an\r\nunion of judicial and political functions against which there is really\r\nmuch to be said. For it is important, not only that the administration\r\nof justice should be pure, but that it should be unsuspected. Now I\r\nam willing to believe that the administration of justice by the unpaid\r\nmagistrates in political cases is pure: but unsuspected it certainly is\r\nnot. It is notorious that, in times of political excitement, the cry\r\nof the whole democratic press always is that a poor man, who has been\r\ndriven by distress to outrage, has far harder measure at the Quarter\r\nSessions than at the Assizes. So loud was this cry in 1819 that Mr\r\nCanning, in one of his most eloquent speeches, pronounced it the most\r\nalarming of all the signs of the times. See then how extravagantly, how\r\nludicrously inconsistent your legislation is. You lay down the principle\r\nthat the union of political functions and judicial functions is a\r\nhateful abuse. That abuse you determine to remove. You accordingly leave\r\nin this House a crowd of judges who, in troubled times, have to try\r\npersons charged with political offences; of judges who have often\r\nbeen accused, truly or falsely, of carrying to the judgment seat their\r\npolitical sympathies and antipathies; and you shut out of the house a\r\nsingle judge, whose duties are of such a nature that it has never once,\r\nsince the time of Edward the First, been even suspected that he or any\r\nof his predecessors has, in the administration of justice, favoured a\r\npolitical ally, or wronged a political opponent.\r\n\r\nBut even if I were to admit, what I altogether deny, that there is\r\nsomething in the functions of the Master of the Rolls which makes it\r\npeculiarly desirable that he should not take any part in politics,\r\nI should still vote against this bill, as most inconsistent and\r\ninefficient. If you think that he ought to be excluded from political\r\nassemblies, why do not you exclude him? You do no such thing. You\r\nexclude him from the House of Commons, but you leave the House of Lords\r\nopen to him. Is not the House of Lords a political assembly? And is it\r\nnot certain that, during several generations, judges have generally had\r\na great ascendency in the House of Lords? A hundred years ago a\r\ngreat judge, Lord Hardwicke, possessed an immense influence there. He\r\nbequeathed his power to another great judge, Lord Mansfield. When age\r\nhad impaired the vigour of Lord Mansfield, the authority which he had,\r\nduring many years, enjoyed, passed to a third judge, Lord Thurlow.\r\nEverybody knows what a dominion that eminent judge, Lord Eldon,\r\nexercised over the peers, what a share he took in making and unmaking\r\nministries, with what idolatrous veneration he was regarded by one great\r\nparty in the State, with what dread and aversion he was regarded by the\r\nother. When the long reign of Lord Eldon had terminated, other judges,\r\nWhig and Tory, appeared at the head of contending factions. Some of us\r\ncan well remember the first ten days of October, 1831. Who, indeed, that\r\nlived through those days can ever forget them? It was the most exciting,\r\nthe most alarming political conjuncture of my time. On the morning of\r\nthe eighth of October, the Reform Bill, after a discussion which had\r\nlasted through many nights, was rejected by the Lords. God forbid that\r\nI should again see such a crisis! I can never hope again to hear such\r\na debate. It was indeed a splendid display of various talents and\r\nacquirements. There are, I dare say, some here who, like myself, watched\r\nthrough the last night of that conflict till the late autumnal dawn,\r\nsometimes walking up and down the long gallery, sometimes squeezing\r\nourselves in behind the throne, or below the bar, to catch the eloquence\r\nof the great orators who, on that great occasion, surpassed themselves.\r\nThere I saw, in the foremost ranks, confronting each other, two judges,\r\non one side Lord Brougham, Chancellor of the realm, on the other Lord\r\nLyndhurst, Chief Baron of the Exchequer. How eagerly we hung on their\r\nwords! How eagerly those words were read before noon by hundreds of\r\nthousands in the capital, and within forty-eight hours, by millions\r\nin every part of the kingdom! With what a burst of popular fury\r\nthe decision of the House was received by the nation! The ruins of\r\nNottingham Castle, the ruins of whole streets and squares at Bristol,\r\nproved but too well to what a point the public feeling had been wound\r\nup. If it be true that nothing is so hateful to the noble lord, the\r\nMember for Kent, as a judge who takes part in political contentions, why\r\ndoes he not bring in a bill to prevent judges from entering those lists\r\nin which Lord Brougham and Lord Lyndhurst then encountered each other?\r\nBut no: the noble lord is perfectly willing to leave those lists open to\r\nthe Master of the Rolls. The noble lord's objection is not to the union\r\nof the judicial character and the political character. He is quite\r\nwilling that anywhere but here judges should be politicians. The Master\r\nof the Rolls may be the soul of a great party, the head of a great\r\nparty, the favourite tribune of a stormy democracy, the chief spokesman\r\nof a haughty aristocracy. He may do all that declamation and sophistry\r\ncan do to inflame the passions or mislead the judgment of a senate. But\r\nit must not be in this room. He must go a hundred and fifty yards hence.\r\nHe must sit on a red bench, and not on a green one. He must say, \"My\r\nLords,\" and not \"Mr Speaker.\" He must say, \"Content,\" and not \"Aye.\"\r\nAnd then he may, without at all shocking the noble lord, be the most\r\nstirring politician in the kingdom.\r\n\r\nBut I am understating my case. I am greatly understating it. For, Sir,\r\nthis union of the judicial character and the political character, in\r\nMembers of the other House of Parliament, is not a merely accidental\r\nunion. Not only may judges be made peers; but all the peers are\r\nnecessarily judges. Surely when the noble lord told us that the union\r\nof political functions and of judicial functions was the most hateful of\r\nall things, he must have forgotten that, by the fundamental laws of the\r\nrealm, a political assembly is the supreme court of appeal, the court\r\nwhich finally confirms or annuls the judgments of the courts, both of\r\ncommon law and of equity, at Westminster, of the courts of Scotland, of\r\nthe courts of Ireland, of this very Master of the Rolls about whom we\r\nare debating. Surely, if the noble lord's principle be a sound one, it\r\nis not with the Master of the Rolls but with the House of Peers that we\r\nought to begin. For, beyond all dispute, it is more important that the\r\ncourt above should be constituted on sound principles than that the\r\ncourt below should be so constituted. If the Master of the Rolls goes\r\nwrong, the House of Peers may correct his errors. But who is to correct\r\nthe errors of the House of Peers? All these considerations the noble\r\nlord overlooks. He is quite willing that the peers shall sit in the\r\nmorning as judges, shall determine questions affecting the property, the\r\nliberty, the character of the Queen's subjects, shall determine those\r\nquestions in the last resort, shall overrule the decisions of all the\r\nother tribunals in the country; and that then, in the afternoon,\r\nthese same noble persons shall meet as politicians, and shall debate,\r\nsometimes rather sharply, sometimes in a style which we dare not imitate\r\nfor fear that you, Sir, should call us to order, about the Canadian\r\nClergy Reserves, the Irish National Schools, the Disabilities of the\r\nJews, the Government of India. I do not blame the noble lord for not\r\nattempting to alter this state of things. We cannot alter it, I know,\r\nwithout taking up the foundations of our constitution. But is it not\r\nabsurd, while we live under such a constitution, while, throughout\r\nour whole system from top to bottom, political functions and judicial\r\nfunctions are combined, to single out, not on any special ground, but\r\nmerely at random, one judge from a crowd of judges, and to exclude\r\nhim, not from all political assemblies, but merely from one political\r\nassembly? Was there ever such a mummery as the carrying of this bill\r\nto the other House will be, if, unfortunately, it should be carried\r\nthither. The noble lord, himself, I have no doubt, a magistrate, himself\r\nat once a judge and a politician, accompanied by several gentlemen who\r\nare at once judges and politicians, will go to the bar of the Lords, who\r\nare all at once judges and politicians, will deliver the bill into the\r\nhands of the Chancellor, who is at once the chief judge of the realm and\r\na Cabinet Minister, and will return hither proud of having purified the\r\nadministration of justice from the taint of politics.\r\n\r\nNo, Sir, no; for the purpose of purifying the administration of justice\r\nthis bill is utterly impotent. It will be effectual for one purpose,\r\nand for one purpose only, for the purpose of weakening and degrading the\r\nHouse of Commons. This is not the first time that an attempt has been\r\nmade, under specious pretexts, to lower the character and impair the\r\nefficiency of the assembly which represents the great body of the\r\nnation. More than a hundred and fifty years ago there was a general cry\r\nthat the number of placemen in Parliament was too great. No doubt, Sir,\r\nthe number was too great: the evil required a remedy: but some rash and\r\nshort-sighted though probably well meaning men, proposed a remedy which\r\nwould have produced far more evil than it would have removed. They\r\ninserted in the Act of Settlement a clause providing that no person who\r\nheld any office under the Crown should sit in this House. The clause was\r\nnot to take effect till the House of Hanover should come to the throne;\r\nand, happily for the country, before the House of Hanover came to the\r\nthrone, the clause was repealed. Had it not been repealed, the Act of\r\nSettlement would have been, not a blessing, but a curse to the country.\r\nThere was no want, indeed, of plausible and popular commonplaces in\r\nfavour of this clause. No man, it was said, can serve two masters. A\r\ncourtier cannot be a good guardian of public liberty. A man who derives\r\nhis subsistence from the taxes cannot be trusted to check the public\r\nexpenditure. You will never have purity, you will never have economy,\r\ntill the stewards of the nation are independent of the Crown, and\r\ndependent only on their constituents. Yes; all this sounded well: but\r\nwhat man of sense now doubts that the effect of a law excluding all\r\nofficial men from this House would have been to depress that branch of\r\nthe legislature which springs from the people, and to increase the\r\npower and consideration of the hereditary aristocracy? The whole\r\nadministration would have been in the hands of peers. The chief object\r\nof every eminent Commoner would have been to obtain a peerage. As\r\nsoon as any man had gained such distinction here by his eloquence and\r\nknowledge that he was selected to fill the post of Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer, Secretary of State, or First Lord of the Admiralty, he would\r\ninstantly have turned his back on what would then indeed have been\r\nemphatically the Lower House, and would have gone to that chamber in\r\nwhich alone it would have been possible for him fully to display his\r\nabilities and fully to gratify his ambition. Walpole and Pulteney, the\r\nfirst Pitt and the second Pitt, Fox, Windham, Canning, Peel, all the men\r\nwhose memory is inseparably associated with this House, all the men of\r\nwhose names we think with pride as we pass through St Stephen's Hall,\r\nthe place of their contentions and their triumphs, would, in the vigour\r\nand prime of life, have become Barons and Viscounts. The great conflict\r\nof parties would have been transferred from the Commons to the Lords.\r\nIt would have been impossible for an assembly, in which not a single\r\nstatesman of great fame, authority, and experience in important affairs\r\nwould have been found, to hold its own against an assembly in which\r\nall our eminent politicians and orators would have been collected. All\r\nEngland, all Europe, would have been reading with breathless interest\r\nthe debates of the peers, and looking with anxiety for the divisions of\r\nthe peers, while we, instead of discussing high questions of state, and\r\ngiving a general direction to the whole domestic and foreign policy\r\nof the realm, should have been settling the details of canal bills and\r\nturnpike bills.\r\n\r\nThe noble lord, the Member for Kent does not, it is true, propose so\r\nextensive and important a change as that which the authors of the Act of\r\nSettlement wished to make. But the tendency of this bill is, beyond\r\nall doubt, to make this House less capable than it once was, and less\r\ncapable than the other House now is, of discharging some of the most\r\nimportant duties of a legislative assembly.\r\n\r\nOf the duties of a legislative assembly, the noble lord, and some of\r\nthose gentlemen who support his bill, seem to me to have formed a very\r\nimperfect notion. They argue as if the only business of the House of\r\nCommons was to turn one set of men out of place, and to bring another\r\nset into place; as if a judge could find no employment here but factious\r\nwrangling. Sir, it is not so. There are extensive and peaceful provinces\r\nof parliamentary business far removed from the fields of battle where\r\nhostile parties encounter each other. A great jurist, seated among\r\nus, might, without taking any prominent part in the strife between\r\nthe Ministry and the Opposition, render to his country most valuable\r\nservice, and earn for himself an imperishable name. Nor was there ever\r\na time when the assistance of such a jurist was more needed, or was more\r\nlikely to be justly appreciated, than at present. No observant man can\r\nfail to perceive that there is in the public mind a general, a\r\ngrowing, an earnest, and at the same time, I must say, a most sober and\r\nreasonable desire for extensive law reform. I hope and believe that, for\r\nsome time to come, no year will pass without progress in law reform;\r\nand I hold that of all law reformers the best is a learned, upright, and\r\nlarge-minded judge. At such a time it is that we are called upon to shut\r\nthe door of this House against the last great judicial functionary to\r\nwhom the unwise legislation of former parliaments has left it open. In\r\nthe meantime the other House is open to him. It is open to all the other\r\njudges who are not suffered to sit here. It is open to the Judge of\r\nthe Admiralty Court, whom the noble lord, twelve or thirteen years ago,\r\nprevailed on us, in an unlucky hour, to exclude. In the other House\r\nis the Lord Chancellor, and several retired Chancellors, a Lord Chief\r\nJustice, in several retired Chief Justices. The Queen may place there\r\nto-morrow the Chief Baron, the two Lords Justices, the three Vice\r\nChancellors, the very Master of the Rolls about whom we are debating:\r\nand we, as if we were not already too weak for the discharge of our\r\nfunctions, are trying to weaken ourselves still more. I harbour no\r\nunfriendly feeling towards the Lords. I anticipate no conflict with\r\nthem. But it is not fit that we should be unable to bear an equal part\r\nwith them in the great work of improving and digesting the law. It\r\nis not fit that we should be under the necessity of placing implicit\r\nconfidence in their superior wisdom, and of registering without\r\namendment, any bill which they may send us. To that humiliating\r\nsituation we are, I grieve to say, fast approaching. I was much struck\r\nby a circumstance which occurred a few days ago. I heard the honourable\r\nMember for Montrose, who, by the by, is one of the supporters of\r\nthis bill, urge the House to pass the Combination Bill, for a most\r\nextraordinary reason. \"We really,\" he said, \"cannot tell how the law\r\nabout combinations of workmen at present stands; and, not knowing how\r\nthe law at present stands, we are quite incompetent to decide whether\r\nit ought to be altered. Let us send the bill up to the Lords. They\r\nunderstand these things. We do not. There are Chancellors, and\r\nex-Chancellors, and Judges among them. No doubt they will do what is\r\nproper; and I shall acquiesce in their decision.\" Why, Sir, did ever any\r\nlegislative assembly abdicate its functions in so humiliating a manner?\r\nIs it not strange that a gentleman, distinguished by his love of popular\r\ninstitutions, and by the jealousy with which he regards the aristocracy,\r\nshould gravely propose that, on a subject which interests and excites\r\nhundreds of thousands of our constituents, we should declare ourselves\r\nincompetent to form an opinion, and beg the Lords to tell us what we\r\nought to do? And is it not stranger still that, while he admits the\r\nincompetence of the House to discharge some of its most important\r\nfunctions, and while he attributes that incompetence to the want of\r\njudicial assistance, he should yet wish to shut out of the House the\r\nonly high judicial functionary who is now permitted to come into it?\r\n\r\nBut, says the honourable Member for Montrose, the Master of the Rolls\r\nhas duties to perform which, if properly performed, will leave him no\r\nleisure for attendance in this House: it is important that there should\r\nbe a division of labour: no man can do two things well; and, if we\r\nsuffer a judge to be a member of Parliament, we shall have both a bad\r\nmember of Parliament and a bad judge.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, if this argument proves anything, it proves that the Master\r\nof the Rolls, and indeed all the other judges, ought to be excluded from\r\nthe House of Lords as well as from the House of Commons. But I deny\r\nthat the argument is of any weight. The division of labour has its\r\ndisadvantages as well as its advantages. In operations merely mechanical\r\nyou can hardly carry the subdivision too far; but you may very easily\r\ncarry it too far in operations which require the exercise of high\r\nintellectual powers. It is quite true, as Adam Smith tells us, that a\r\npin will be best made when one man does nothing but cut the wire, when\r\nanother does nothing but mould the head, when a third does nothing but\r\nsharpen the point. But it is not true that Michael Angelo would have\r\nbeen a greater painter if he had not been a sculptor: it is not true\r\nthat Newton would have been a greater experimental philosopher if he had\r\nnot been a geometrician; and it is not true that a man will be a worse\r\nlawgiver because he is a great judge. I believe that there is as close\r\na connection between the functions of the judge and the functions of the\r\nlawgiver as between anatomy and surgery. Would it not be the height of\r\nabsurdity to lay down the rule that nobody who dissected the dead should\r\nbe allowed to operate on the living? The effect of such a division of\r\nlabour would be that you would have nothing but bungling surgery; and\r\nthe effect of the division of labour which the honourable Member for\r\nMontrose recommends will be that we shall have plenty of bungling\r\nlegislation. Who can be so well qualified to make laws and to mend laws\r\nas a man whose business is to interpret laws and to administer laws? As\r\nto this point I have great pleasure in citing an authority to which\r\nthe honourable Member for Montrose will, I know, be disposed to pay the\r\ngreatest deference; the authority of Mr Bentham. Of Mr Bentham's\r\nmoral and political speculations, I entertain, I must own, a very\r\nmean opinion: but I hold him in high esteem as a jurist. Among all his\r\nwritings there is none which I value more than the treatise on Judicial\r\nOrganization. In that excellent work he discusses the question whether a\r\nperson who holds a judicial office ought to be permitted to hold with\r\nit any other office. Mr Bentham argues strongly and convincingly against\r\npluralities; but he admits that there is one exception to the general\r\nrule. A judge, he says, ought to be allowed to sit in the legislature as\r\na representative of the people; for the best school for a legislator\r\nis the judicial bench; and the supply of legislative skill is in all\r\nsocieties so scanty that none of it can be spared.\r\n\r\nMy honourable friend, the Member for Surrey, has completely refuted\r\nanother argument to which the noble lord, the Member for Kent, appears\r\nto attach considerable importance. The noble lord conceives that no\r\nperson can enter this House without stooping to practice arts which\r\nwould ill become the gravity of the judicial character. He spoke\r\nparticularly of what he called the jollifications usual at elections.\r\nUndoubtedly the festivities at elections are sometimes disgraced by\r\nintemperance, and sometimes by buffoonery; and I wish from the bottom of\r\nmy heart that intemperance and buffoonery were the worst means to which\r\nmen, reputed upright and honourable in private life, have resorted in\r\norder to obtain seats in the legislature. I should, indeed, be sorry\r\nif any Master of the Rolls should court the favour of the populace by\r\nplaying the mounttebank on the hustings or on tavern tables. Still more\r\nsorry should I be if any Master of the Rolls were to disgrace himself\r\nand his office by employing the ministry of the Frails and the Flewkers,\r\nby sending vile emissaries with false names, false addresses, and bags\r\nof sovereigns, to buy the votes of the poor. No doubt a Master of the\r\nRolls ought to be free, not only from guilt, but from suspicion. I\r\nhave not hitherto mentioned the present Master of the Rolls. I have not\r\nmentioned him because, in my opinion, this question ought to be decided\r\nby general and not by personal considerations. I cannot, however,\r\nrefrain from saying, with a confidence which springs from long and\r\nintimate acquaintance, that my valued friend, Sir John Romilly, will\r\nnever again sit in this House unless he can come in by means very\r\ndifferent from those by which he was turned out. But, Sir, are we\r\nprepared to say that no person can become a representative of the\r\nEnglish people except by some sacrifice of integrity, or at least of\r\npersonal dignity? If it be so, we had indeed better think of setting\r\nour House in order. If it be so, the prospects of our country are dark\r\nindeed. How can England retain her place among the nations, if the\r\nassembly to which all her dearest interests are confided, the assembly\r\nwhich can, by a single vote, transfer the management of her affairs to\r\nnew hands, and give a new direction to her whole policy, foreign and\r\ndomestic, financial, commercial, and colonial, is closed against every\r\nman who has rigid principles and a fine sense of decorum? But it is\r\nnot so. Did that great judge, Sir William Scott, lower his character by\r\nentering this House as Member for the University of Oxford? Did Sir\r\nJohn Copley lower his character by entering this House as Member for the\r\nUniversity of Cambridge? But the universities, you say, are constituent\r\nbodies of a very peculiar kind. Be it so. Then, by your own admission,\r\nthere are a few seats in this House which eminent judges have filled\r\nand may fill without any unseemly condescension. But it would be most\r\nunjust, and in me, especially, most ungrateful, to compliment the\r\nuniversities at the expense of other constituent bodies. I am one of\r\nmany members who know by experience that a generosity and a delicacy\r\nof sentiment which would do honour to any seat of learning may be found\r\namong the ten pound householders of our great cities. And, Sir, as to\r\nthe counties, need we look further than to your chair? It is of as much\r\nimportance that you should punctiliously preserve your dignity as that\r\nthe Master of the Rolls should punctiliously preserve his dignity.\r\nIf you had, at the last election, done anything inconsistent with\r\nthe integrity, with the gravity, with the suavity of temper which so\r\neminently qualify you to preside over our deliberations, your public\r\nusefulness would have been seriously diminished. But the great county\r\nwhich does itself honour by sending you to the House required from you\r\nnothing unbecoming your character, and would have felt itself degraded\r\nby your degradation. And what reason is there to doubt that other\r\nconstituent bodies would act as justly and considerately towards a judge\r\ndistinguished by uprightness and ability as Hampshire has acted towards\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nOne very futile argument only remains to be noticed. It is said that\r\nwe ought to be consistent; and that, having turned the Judge of the\r\nAdmiralty out of the House, we ought to send the Master of the Rolls\r\nafter him. I admit, Sir, that our system is at present very anomalous.\r\nBut it is better that a system should be anomalous than that it should\r\nbe uniformly and consistently bad. You have entered on a wrong course.\r\nMy advice is first that you stop, and secondly that you retrace your\r\nsteps. The time is not far distant when it will be necessary for us to\r\nrevise the constitution of this House. On that occasion, it will be\r\npart of our duty to reconsider the rule which determines what\r\npublic functionaries shall be admitted to sit here, and what public\r\nfunctionaries shall be excluded. That rule is, I must say, singularly\r\nabsurd. It is this, that no person who holds any office created since\r\nthe twenty-fifth of October, 1705, shall be a member of the House of\r\nCommons. Nothing can be more unreasonable or more inconvenient. In\r\n1705, there were two Secretaries of State and two Under Secretaries.\r\nConsequently, to this day, only two Secretaries of State and two Under\r\nSecretaries can sit among us. Suppose that the Home Secretary and the\r\nColonial Secretary are members of this House, and that the office of\r\nForeign Secretary becomes vacant. In that case, no member of this House,\r\nwhatever may be his qualifications, his fame in diplomacy, his knowledge\r\nof all the politics of the Courts of Europe, can be appointed. Her\r\nMajesty must give the Admiralty to the commoner who is, of all her\r\nsubjects, fittest for the Foreign Office, and the seals of the Foreign\r\nOffice to some peer who would perhaps be fitter for the Admiralty.\r\nAgain, the Postmaster General cannot sit in this House. Yet why not? He\r\nalways comes in and goes out with the Government: he is often a member\r\nof the Cabinet; and I believe that he is, of all public functionaries,\r\nthe Chancellor of the Exchequer alone excepted, the one whom it would be\r\nmost convenient to have here. I earnestly hope that, before long,\r\nthis whole subject will be taken into serious consideration. As to the\r\njudges, the rule which I should wish to see laid down is very simple.\r\nI would admit into this House any judge whom the people might elect,\r\nunless there were some special reason against admitting him. There is a\r\nspecial reason against admitting any Irish or Scotch judge. Such a judge\r\ncannot attend this House without ceasing to attend his court. There is a\r\nspecial reason against admitting the Judges of the Queen's Bench and of\r\nthe Common Pleas, and the Barons of the Exchequer. They are summoned to\r\nthe House of Lords; and they sit there: their assistance is absolutely\r\nnecessary to enable that House to discharge its functions as the highest\r\ncourt of appeal; and it would manifestly be both inconvenient and\r\nderogatory to our dignity that members of our body should be at the beck\r\nand call of the peers. I see no special reason for excluding the Master\r\nof the Rolls; and I would, therefore, leave our door open to him. I\r\nwould open it to the Judge of the Admiralty, who has been most unwisely\r\nexcluded. I would open it to other great judicial officers who are\r\nnow excluded solely because their offices did not exist in 1705,\r\nparticularly to the two Lords Justices, and the three Vice Chancellors.\r\nIn this way, we should, I am convinced, greatly facilitate the important\r\nand arduous work of law reform; we would raise the character of this\r\nHouse: and I need not say that with the character of this House must\r\nrise or fall the estimation in which representative institutions are\r\nheld throughout the world. But, whether the extensive changes which\r\nI have recommended shall be thought desirable or not, I trust that\r\nwe shall reject the bill of the noble lord. I address myself to the\r\nConservative members on your left hand; and I ask them whether they are\r\nprepared to alter, on grounds purely theoretical, a system which\r\nhas lasted during twenty generations without producing the smallest\r\npractical evil. I turn to the Liberal members on this side; and I ask\r\nthem whether they are prepared to lower the reputation and to impair\r\nthe efficiency of that branch of the legislature which springs from\r\nthe people. For myself, Sir, I hope that I am at once a Liberal and a\r\nConservative politician; and, in both characters, I shall give a clear\r\nand conscientious vote in favour of the amendment moved by my honourable\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n     Absalom and Achitophel of Dryden, character of it.\r\n\r\n     Absolute government, theory of.\r\n\r\n     Absolute rulers.\r\n\r\n     Academy, the French, its services to literature.\r\n\r\n     Addington, Henry, formation of his administration.\r\n     His position as Prime Minister.\r\n     Resigns.\r\n     Raised to the peerage.\r\n\r\n     Aeschines, compared by Mr Mitford to Demosthenes.\r\n\r\n     Aeschylus, his works, how regarded by Quintillian.\r\n\r\n     Agesilaus, depressed by the constitution of Lycurgus.\r\n\r\n     Ajax, the prayer of, in the Iliad.\r\n\r\n     Aldrich, Dean, his mode of instructing the youths of his college.\r\n     Employs Charles Boyle to edit the letters of Phalaris.\r\n\r\n     Alfieri, Vittorio, character of his works.\r\n     His great fault in his compositions.\r\n\r\n     Anatomy Bill, Speech on.\r\n\r\n     Antinomian barn preacher, story of the.\r\n\r\n     Approbation, love of.\r\n\r\n     Aristocratical form of government.
