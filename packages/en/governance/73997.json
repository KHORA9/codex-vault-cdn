In this edition the changes in the history\r\nare concerned chiefly with the revival of the International, which,\r\nsince the Stuttgart Congress in 1907, may be regarded as an accomplished\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nI have made it no part of my plan to dwell on details. The interest and\r\nsignificance of the history of socialism will be found, not in its\r\ndetails and accidents, but in the development of its cardinal\r\nprinciples, which I have endeavoured to trace. Readers desirous of\r\ndetail must be referred to the writings of the various socialists, or to\r\nworks that treat of special phases of the movement. Yet I hope that the\r\nstatement of the leading theories is sufficiently clear and adequate to\r\nenable the reader to form his own judgment of the highly controversial\r\nmatters involved in the history of socialism. I may add that in every\r\ncase my account is drawn from an extensive study of the sources. These\r\nsources I have given both in the text and in footnotes. For the more\r\nrecent development of the subject, however, the material is derived from\r\nsuch a multitude of books, pamphlets, periodicals, and journals, as well\r\nas from personal inquiry and observation, that it has not been found\r\npracticable to indicate them.\r\n\r\nBut the purely historical part of such a work is far from being the most\r\ndifficult. The real difficulty begins when we attempt to form a clear\r\nconception of the meaning and significance of the socialistic movement,\r\nto indicate its place in history, and the issues to which it is tending.\r\nIn the concluding chapters I have made such an attempt. The good reader\r\nwho takes the trouble to go so far through my book can accept my\r\ncontribution to a hard problem for what it is worth. He may at least\r\nfeel assured that it is no hasty and ill-considered effort which is\r\nplaced before him. The present volume grew out of the articles on\r\nsocialism published in the ninth edition of the _Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica_. The views advocated there were first set forth in my\r\n_Inquiry into Socialism_, published in 1887. In this edition of the\r\n_History_ they have in some points received such expansion and\r\nmodification as time and repeated, self-criticism have suggested. I beg\r\nparticularly to invite the attention of the reader to the last two\r\nchapters, in which the present position of socialism and its relation to\r\nsome contemporary questions, such as those of Empire, are set forth.\r\n\r\nTo all thoughtful and discerning men it should now be clear that the\r\nsolution of the social question is the great task which has been laid\r\nupon the present epoch in the history of the world. Socialism grew to be\r\na very important question during the nineteenth century; in all\r\nprobability it will be the supreme question of the twentieth. No higher\r\nfelicity can befall any man than to have thrown a real light on the\r\ngreatest problem of his time; and to have utterly failed is no disgrace.\r\nIn such a cause it is an honour even to have done efficient work as a\r\nnavvy or hodman.\r\n\r\nFor help with the notes on the recent progress of socialism I wish to\r\nexpress special obligations to Mr. H. W. Lee, secretary of the Social\r\nDemocratic Party, to Mr. J. R. Macdonald, M.P., secretary of the Labour\r\nParty, and to Mr. E. R. Pease, secretary of the Fabian Society.\r\n\r\n London, _February_ 1909.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         A HISTORY OF SOCIALISM\r\n\r\n\r\n                              INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThough much has been said and written about socialism for many years, it\r\nstill remains a questionable name which awakens in the mind of the\r\nreader doubt, perplexity, and contradiction.\r\n\r\nBut there can be no question that it is a growing power throughout the\r\nworld. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the most intelligent and\r\nthe best organised working-men of all civilised countries are passing\r\nover to it. The opinions which are being accepted by the foremost of the\r\nworking-classes to-day will in all probability have the same attraction\r\nfor their less advanced brethren to-morrow. It is a subject, however,\r\nwhich concerns all classes, and it is forcing to the front a wide group\r\nof problems which are every day becoming more urgent.\r\n\r\nIn view of this there is only one right and safe course; we should seek\r\nto know the truth about socialism. The discontent which tends to\r\ndisturbance and revolution can be removed only by satisfying the\r\nlegitimate needs and aspirations of those who suffer.\r\n\r\nWe all know that the propaganda of socialism has been attended with\r\nintemperate and violent language, with wild opinions which are often\r\ninconsistent with the first principles of social order, with\r\nrevolutionary outbreaks leading to bloodshed, desolation and\r\nlong-continued unrest and suspicion. These things are greatly to be\r\ndeplored. But we shall be wise if we regard them as symptoms of\r\nwide-spread and deep-seated social disease. The best way to cure such\r\ndisease is to study and remove the causes of it. No physician will have\r\nany success in combating a malady if he content himself with suppressing\r\nits symptoms.\r\n\r\nFor the study of socialism two things are essential on the part of the\r\nreader—good-will and the open mind. Socialism has at least a most\r\npowerful provisional claim on our good-will, that it professes to\r\nrepresent the cause of the sufferers in the world’s long agony, of the\r\nworking-classes, of women, and of the down-trodden nations and races. If\r\nit can make any solid contribution in such a far-reaching cause it has\r\nthe strongest right to be heard.\r\n\r\nNeed we say that no new movement like socialism can be understood or\r\nappreciated without some measure of the open mind? In the course of\r\nhistory it has been proved over and over again that established ideas\r\nand institutions are not always in the right in every respect, and that\r\nnovel opinions, though presented in extravagant and intemperate\r\nlanguage, are not always entirely wrong. Even the most prejudiced reader\r\nwill do well to consider that a cause which now numbers millions of\r\nintelligent adherents, for which men have died and gladly suffered\r\nimprisonment and privation of every kind, may contain elements of truth\r\nand of well-justified hope for the future.\r\n\r\nAbove all things, it is essential to remember that socialism is not a\r\nstereotyped system of dogma. It is a movement which springs out of a\r\nvast and only partially shapen reality. It is therefore living and\r\nliable to change. It has a history on which we can look back; but it is\r\nabove all things a force of the present and the future, and its\r\ninfluence in the future for good or evil will depend on how we the men\r\nof the present relate ourselves to it.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it would be a great wrong if we encouraged vain and\r\ndelusive expectations; but it would be a wrong even greater, on the\r\nother hand, if from whim or prejudice or pessimism we did anything that\r\nmight be an obstacle to truth and progress. In a subject so momentous\r\nthe only right course is to eschew passion and prejudice, and to follow\r\ntruth with goodwill and an open mind.\r\n\r\nThe word ‘socialism’ appears to have been first used in _The Poor Man’s\r\nGuardian_ in 1833. In 1835, a society, which received the grandiloquent\r\nname of the Association of all Classes of all Nations, was founded under\r\nthe auspices of Robert Owen; and the words socialist and socialism\r\nbecame current during the discussions which arose in connection with\r\nit.[1] As Owen and his school had no esteem for the political reform of\r\nthe time, and laid all emphasis on the necessity of social improvement\r\nand reconstruction, it is obvious how the name came to be recognised as\r\nsuitable and distinctive. The term was soon afterwards borrowed from\r\nEngland, as he himself tells us, by a distinguished French writer,\r\nReybaud, in his well-known work the _Réformateurs modernes_, in which he\r\ndiscussed the theories of Saint-Simon, Fourier, and Owen. Through\r\nReybaud it soon gained wide currency on the Continent, and is now the\r\naccepted world-historic name for one of the most remarkable movements of\r\nthe nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe name was thus first applied in England to Owen’s theory of social\r\nreconstruction, and in France to those also of Saint-Simon and Fourier.\r\nThe best usage has always connected it with the views of these men, and\r\nwith the cognate opinions which have since appeared. But the word is\r\nused with a great variety of meaning, not only in popular speech and by\r\npoliticians, but even by economists and learned critics of socialism.\r\nThere is a growing tendency to regard as socialistic any interference\r\nwith property undertaken by society on behalf of the poor, the\r\nlimitation of the principle of _laissez-faire_ in favour of the\r\nsuffering classes, radical social reform which disturbs the present\r\nsystem of private property as regulated by free competition. It is\r\nprobable enough that the word will be permanently used to express the\r\nchange in practice and opinion indicated by these phrases, as a general\r\nname for the strong reaction that has now set in against the\r\noverstrained individualism and one-sided freedom which date from the end\r\nof the eighteenth century. The application is neither precise nor\r\naccurate; but it is use and wont that determine the meaning of words,\r\nand this seems to be the tendency of use and wont.\r\n\r\nEven economic writers differ greatly in the meaning they attach to the\r\nword. As socialism has been most powerful and most studied on the\r\nContinent, it may be interesting to compare the definitions given by\r\nsome leading French and German economists. The great German economist\r\nRoscher defines it as including ‘those tendencies which demand a greater\r\nregard for the common weal than consists with human nature.’[2] Adolf\r\nHeld says that ‘we may define as socialistic every tendency which\r\ndemands the subordination of the individual will to the community.’[3]\r\nJanet more precisely defines it as follows: ‘We call socialism every\r\ndoctrine which teaches that the State has a right to correct the\r\ninequality of wealth which exists among men, and to legally establish\r\nthe balance by taking from those who have too much in order to give to\r\nthose who have not enough, and that in a permanent manner, and not in\r\nsuch and such a particular case—a famine, for instance, a public\r\ncalamity, etc.’[4] Laveleye explains it thus: ‘In the first place, every\r\nsocialistic doctrine aims at introducing greater equality in social\r\nconditions; and in the second place, at realising those reforms by the\r\nlaw or the State.’[5] Von Scheel simply defines it as the ‘economic\r\nphilosophy of the suffering classes.’[6]\r\n\r\nOf all these definitions it can only be said that they more or less\r\nfaithfully reflect current opinion as to the nature of socialism. They\r\nare either too vague or they are misleading, and they quite fail to\r\nbring out the clear and strongly marked characteristics that distinguish\r\nthe phenomena to which the name of socialism is properly applied. To say\r\nthat socialism exacts a greater regard for the common weal than is\r\ncompatible with human nature is to pass sentence on the movement, not to\r\ndefine it. In all ages of the world, and under all forms and tendencies\r\nof government and of social evolution, the will of the individual has\r\nbeen subordinated to the will of society, often unduly so.\r\n\r\nIt is also most misleading to speak as if socialism must proceed from\r\nthe State as we know it. The early socialism proceeded from private\r\neffort and experiment. A great deal of the most notorious socialism of\r\nthe present day aims not only at subverting the existing State in every\r\nform, but all the existing political and social institutions. The most\r\npowerful and most philosophic, that of Karl Marx, aimed at superseding\r\nthe existing Governments by a vast international combination of the\r\nworkers of all nations, without distinction of creed, colour, or\r\nnationality.\r\n\r\nStill more objectionable, however, is the tendency not unfrequently\r\nshown to identify socialism with a violent and lawless revolutionary\r\nspirit. As sometimes used, ‘socialism’ means nothing more nor less than\r\nthe most modern form of the revolutionary spirit with a suggestion of\r\nanarchy and dynamite. This is to confound the essence of the movement\r\nwith an accidental feature more or less common to all great innovations.\r\nEvery new thing of any moment, whether good or evil, has its\r\nrevolutionary stage, in which it disturbs and upsets the accepted\r\nbeliefs and institutions. The Protestant Reformation was for more than a\r\ncentury and a half the occasion of civil and international trouble and\r\nbloodshed. The suppression of American slavery could not be effected\r\nwithout a tremendous civil war. There was a time when the opinions\r\ncomprehended under the name of ‘liberalism’ had to fight to the death\r\nfor toleration; and representative government was at one time a\r\nrevolutionary innovation. The fact that a movement is revolutionary\r\ngenerally implies only that it is new, that it is disposed to exert\r\nitself by strong methods, and is calculated to make great changes. It is\r\nan unhappy feature of most great changes that they have been attended\r\nwith the exercise of force, but that is because the powers in possession\r\nhave generally attempted to suppress them by the exercise of force.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact socialism is one of the most elastic and protean\r\nphenomena of history, varying according to the time and circumstances in\r\nwhich it appears, and with the character and opinions and institutions\r\nof the people who adopt it. Such a movement cannot be condemned or\r\napproved _en bloc_. Most of the current formulæ to which it has been\r\nreferred for praise or censure are totally erroneous and misleading. Yet\r\nin the midst of the various theories that go by the name of ‘socialism’\r\nthere is a kernel of principle that is common to them all. That\r\nprinciple is of an economic nature, and is most clear and precise.\r\n\r\nThe central aim of socialism is to terminate the divorce of the workers\r\nfrom the natural sources of subsistence and of culture. The socialist\r\ntheory is based on the historical assertion that the course of social\r\nevolution for centuries has gradually been to exclude the producing\r\nclasses from the possession of land and capital, and to establish a new\r\nsubjection, the subjection of workers who have nothing to depend on but\r\nprecarious wage-labour. Socialists maintain that the present system (in\r\nwhich land and capital are the property of private individuals freely\r\nstruggling for increase of wealth) leads inevitably to social and\r\neconomic anarchy, to the degradation of the working man and his family,\r\nto the growth of vice and idleness among the wealthy classes and their\r\ndependants, to bad and inartistic workmanship, to insecurity, waste, and\r\nstarvation; and that it is tending more and more to separate society\r\ninto two classes, wealthy millionaires confronted with an enormous mass\r\nof proletarians, the issue out of which must either be socialism or\r\nsocial ruin. To avoid all these evils and to secure a more equitable\r\ndistribution of the means and appliances of happiness, socialists\r\npropose that land and capital, which are the requisites of labour and\r\nthe sources of all wealth and culture, should be placed under social\r\nownership and control.\r\n\r\nIn thus maintaining that society should assume the management of\r\nindustry and secure an equitable distribution of its fruits, socialists\r\nare agreed; but on the most important points of detail they differ very\r\ngreatly. They differ as to the form society will take in carrying out\r\nthe socialist programme, as to the relation of local bodies to the\r\ncentral government, and whether there is to be any central government,\r\nor any government at all in the ordinary sense of the word; as to the\r\ninfluence of the national idea in the society of the future, etc. They\r\ndiffer also as to what should be regarded as an ‘equitable’ system of\r\ndistribution. The school of Saint-Simon advocated a social hierarchy, in\r\nwhich every man should be placed according to his capacity and rewarded\r\naccording to his works. In the communities of Fourier the minimum of\r\nsubsistence was to be guaranteed to each out of the common gain, the\r\nremainder to be divided between labour, capital, and\r\ntalent—five-twelfths going to the first, four-twelfths to the second\r\nand three-twelfths to the third. At the revolution of 1848 Louis Blanc\r\nproposed that remuneration should be equal for all members of his\r\n_social workshops_. In the programme drawn up by the united Social\r\nDemocrats of Germany (Gotha, 1875) it was provided that all shall enjoy\r\nthe results of labour according to their reasonable wants, all of course\r\nbeing bound to work.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say also that the theories of socialism have been held\r\nin connection with the most varying opinions in philosophy and religion.\r\nA great deal of the historic socialism has been regarded as a necessary\r\nimplicate of idealism. The prevailing socialism of the day is in large\r\npart based on the frankest and most outspoken revolutionary materialism.\r\nOn the other hand, many socialists hold that their system is a necessary\r\noutcome of Christianity, that socialism and Christianity are essential\r\nthe one to the other; and it should be said that the ethics of socialism\r\nare closely akin to the ethics of Christianity, if not identical with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nStill, it should be insisted that the basis of socialism is economic,\r\ninvolving a fundamental change in the relation of labour to land and\r\ncapital—a change which will largely affect production, and will\r\nentirely revolutionise the existing system of distribution. But, while\r\nits basis is economic, socialism implies and carries with it a change in\r\nthe political, ethical, technical, and artistic arrangements and\r\ninstitutions of society, which would constitute a revolution greater\r\nthan has ever taken place in human history, greater than the transition\r\nfrom the ancient to the mediæval world, or from the latter to the\r\nexisting order of society.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, such a change generally assumes as its political\r\ncomplement the most thoroughly democratic organisation of society. The\r\nearly socialism of Owen and Saint-Simon was marked by not a little of\r\nthe autocratic spirit; but the tendency of the present socialism is more\r\nand more to ally itself with the most advanced democracy. Socialism, in\r\nfact, claims to be the economic complement of democracy, maintaining\r\nthat without a fundamental economic change political privilege has\r\nneither meaning nor value.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, socialism naturally goes with an unselfish or\r\naltruistic system of ethics. The most characteristic feature of the old\r\nsocieties was the exploitation of the weak by the strong under the\r\nsystems of slavery, serfdom, and wage-labour. Under the socialistic\r\n_régime_ it is the privilege and duty of the strong and talented to use\r\ntheir superior force and richer endowments in the service of their\r\nfellow-men without distinction of class, or nation, or creed. Whatever\r\nour opinion may be of the wisdom or practicability of their theories,\r\nhistory proves that socialists have been ready to sacrifice wealth,\r\nsocial position, and life itself, for the cause which they have adopted.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, socialists maintain that, under their system and no\r\nother, can the highest excellence and beauty be realised in industrial\r\nproduction and in art; whereas under the present system beauty and\r\nthoroughness are alike sacrificed to cheapness, which is a necessity of\r\nsuccessful competition.\r\n\r\nLastly, the socialists refuse to admit that individual happiness or\r\nfreedom or character would be sacrificed under the social arrangements\r\nthey propose. They believe that under the present system a free and\r\nharmonious development of individual capacity and happiness is possible\r\nonly for the privileged minority, and that socialism alone can open up a\r\nfair opportunity for all. They believe, in short, that there is no\r\nopposition whatever between socialism and individuality rightly\r\nunderstood, that these two are complements the one of the other, that in\r\nsocialism alone may every individual have hope of free development and a\r\nfull realisation of himself.\r\n\r\nHaving shown how wide a social revolution is implied in the socialistic\r\nscheme of reconstruction, we may now state (1) that the economic basis\r\nof the prevalent socialism is a collectivism which excludes private\r\npossession of land and capital, and places them under social ownership\r\nin some form or other. In the words of Schäffle, ‘the Alpha and Omega of\r\nsocialism is the transformation of private competing capital into a\r\nunited collective capital.’[7] Adolf Wagner’s more elaborate definition\r\nof it[8] is entirely in agreement with that of Schäffle. Such a system,\r\nwhile insisting on collective capital, is quite consistent with private\r\nproperty in other forms, and with perfect freedom in the use of one’s\r\nown share in the equitable distribution of the produce of the associated\r\nlabour. A thorough-going socialism demands that this principle should be\r\napplied to the capital and production of the whole world; only then can\r\nit attain to supreme and perfect realisation. But a sober-minded\r\nsocialism will admit that the various intermediate stages in which the\r\nprinciple finds a partial application are so far a true and real\r\ndevelopment of the socialistic idea.\r\n\r\nEven the best definitions, however, are only of secondary importance;\r\nand while we believe that those we have just mentioned give an accurate\r\naccount of the prevailing socialism, they are arbitrary, abstract, and\r\notherwise open to objection. As we have already seen, the system of\r\nFourier admitted of private capital under social control. The absolute\r\nviews of the subject now current are due to the excessive love of system\r\ncharacteristic of German thought, and are not consistent either with\r\nhistory or human nature.\r\n\r\n(2) Socialism is both a theory of social evolution and a working force\r\nin the history of the nineteenth century. The teaching of some eminent\r\nsocialists, such as Rodbertus, may be regarded as a prophecy concerning\r\nthe social development of the future rather than as a subject of\r\nagitation. In their view socialism is the next stage in the evolution of\r\nsociety, destined after many generations to supersede capitalism, as\r\ncapitalism displaced feudalism, and feudalism succeeded to slavery. Even\r\nthe majority of the most active socialists consider the question as\r\nstill in the stage of agitation and propaganda, their present task being\r\nthat of enlightening the masses until the consummation of the present\r\nsocial development, and the declared bankruptcy of the present social\r\norder, shall have delivered the world into their hands. Socialism,\r\ntherefore, is for the most part a theory affecting the future, more or\r\nless remote, and has only to a limited degree gained a real and\r\npractical footing in the life of our time. Yet it should not be\r\nforgotten that its doctrines have most powerfully affected all the\r\nablest recent economic writers of Germany, and have even considerably\r\nmodified German legislation. Its influence is rapidly growing among the\r\nlower and also among the most advanced classes in almost every country\r\ndominated by European culture, following the development of capitalism,\r\nof which it is not merely the negation, but in a far wider and more real\r\nsense is also the goal.\r\n\r\n(3) In its doctrinal aspects socialism is most interesting as a\r\ncriticism of the present economic order, of what socialists call the\r\ncapitalistic system, with which the existing land system is connected.\r\nUnder the present economic order land and capital (the material and\r\ninstruments without which industry is impossible) are the property of a\r\nclass employing a class of wage-labourers handicapped by their exclusion\r\nfrom land and capital. Competition is the general rule by which the\r\nshare of the members of those classes in the fruits of production is\r\ndetermined. Against this system critical socialism is a reasoned\r\nprotest; and it is at issue also with the prevailing political economy,\r\nin so far as it assumes or maintains the permanence or righteousness of\r\nthis economic order. Of the economic optimism implied in the historic\r\ndoctrine of _laissez-faire_, socialism is an uncompromising rejection.\r\n\r\n(4) Socialism is usually regarded as a phase of the struggle for the\r\nemancipation of labour, for the complete participation of the working\r\nclasses in the material, intellectual, and spiritual inheritance of the\r\nhuman race. This is certainly the most substantial and most prominent\r\npart of the socialist programme, the working classes being the most\r\nnumerous and the worst sufferers from the present _régime_. This view,\r\nhowever, is rather one-sided, for socialism claims not less to be in the\r\ninterest of the small capitalist gradually crushed by the competition of\r\nthe larger, and in the interest also of the large capitalist, whose\r\nposition is endangered by the vastness and unwieldiness of his success,\r\nand by the world-wide economic anarchy from which even the greatest are\r\nnot secure. Still, it is the deliverance of the working class that\r\nstands in the front of every socialistic theory; and, though the\r\ninitiative in socialist speculation and action has usually come from men\r\nbelonging to the middle and upper classes, yet it is to the workmen that\r\nthey generally appeal.\r\n\r\nWhile recognising the great confusion in the use of the word\r\n‘socialism,’ we have treated it as properly a phenomenon of the\r\nnineteenth century, beginning in France with Saint-Simon and Fourier, in\r\nEngland with Robert Owen, and most powerfully represented at the present\r\nday by the school of Karl Marx. As we have seen, however, there are\r\ndefinitions of the word which would give it a wider range of meaning and\r\na more ancient beginning, compared with which capitalism is but of\r\nyesterday; which would, in fact, make it as old as human society itself.\r\nIn the early stages of human development, when the tribe or the village\r\ncommunity was the social unit, the subordination of the individual to\r\nthe society in which he dwelt was the rule, and common property was the\r\nprevalent form. In the development of the idea of property, especially\r\nas regards land, three successive historical stages are broadly\r\nrecognised—common property and common enjoyment of it, common property\r\nand private enjoyment, private property and private enjoyment. The last\r\nform did not attain to full expression till the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, when the principle of individual freedom, which was really a\r\nreaction against privileged restriction, was proclaimed as a positive\r\naxiom of government and of economics. The free individual struggle for\r\nwealth, and for the social advantages dependent on wealth, is a\r\ncomparatively recent thing.\r\n\r\nAt all periods of history the State has reserved to itself the right to\r\ninterpose in the arrangements of property—sometimes in favour of the\r\npoor, as in the case of the English poor law, which may thus be regarded\r\nas a socialistic measure. Moreover, all through history revolts in\r\nfavour of the rearrangement of property have been very frequent. From\r\nthe beginning there have existed misery and discontent, the\r\ncontemplation of which has called forth schemes of an ideal society in\r\nthe noblest and most sympathetic minds. Of these are the Utopias of\r\nPlato and Thomas More, advocating a systematic communism. And in the\r\nsocieties of the Catholic Church we have a permanent example of common\r\nproperty and a common enjoyment of it.\r\n\r\nHow are we to distinguish the socialism of the nineteenth century from\r\nthese old-world phenomena, and especially from the communism which has\r\nplayed so great a part in history? To this query it is not difficult to\r\ngive a clear and precise answer from the socialist point of view.\r\nSocialism is a stage in the evolution of society which could not arrive\r\ntill the conditions necessary to it had been established. Of these, one\r\nmost essential condition was the development of the great industrialism\r\nwhich, after a long period of preparation and gradual growth, began to\r\nreach its culminating point with the inventions and technical\r\nimprovements, with the application of steam and the rise of the factory\r\nsystem, in England towards the end of the eighteenth century. Under this\r\nsystem industry was organised into a vast social operation, and was thus\r\nalready so far socialised; but it was a system that was exploited by the\r\nindividual owner of the capital at his own pleasure and for his own\r\nbehoof. Under the pressure of the competition of the large industry, the\r\nsmall capitalist is gradually crushed out, and the working producers\r\nbecome wage-labourers organised and drilled in immense factories and\r\nworkshops. The development of this system still continues, and is\r\nenveloping the whole world. Such is the industrial revolution.\r\n\r\nParallel with this a revolution in the world of ideas, equally great and\r\nequally necessary to the rise of socialism, has taken place. This change\r\nof thought, which made its world-historic announcement in the French\r\nRevolution, made reason the supreme judge, and had freedom for its great\r\npractical watchword. It was represented in the economic sphere by the\r\nschool of Adam Smith. Socialism was an outcome of it too, and first of\r\nall in Saint-Simon and his school professed to give the positive and\r\nconstructive corrective to a negative movement which did not see that it\r\nwas merely negative and therefore temporary. In other words, Saint-Simon\r\nmay be said to aim at nothing less than the completion of the work of\r\nVoltaire, Rousseau, and Adam Smith.\r\n\r\nThus socialism professes to be the legitimate child of two great\r\nrevolutions,—of the industrial revolution which began to establish\r\nitself in England towards the end of the eighteenth century, and of the\r\nparallel revolution in thought which about the same time found most\r\nprominent expression in France. Robert Owen worked chiefly under the\r\ninfluence of the former; Saint-Simon and Fourier grew up under the\r\nlatter. The conspiracy of Babeuf, which took place in 1796, shortly\r\nafter the French Revolution, is properly to be regarded as a crude\r\nrevolutionary communism not essentially different from the rude efforts\r\nin communism made in earlier periods of history. With Saint-Simon and\r\nOwen historic socialism really begins, and is no longer an isolated\r\nfact, but has had a continuous and widening development, the succession\r\nof socialistic teaching and propaganda being taken up by one country\r\nafter another throughout the civilised world.\r\n\r\nWe have seen, then, that the rise of socialism as a new and reasoned\r\ntheory of society was relative to the industrial revolution and to the\r\nideas proclaimed in the French Revolution, prominent among which,\r\nbesides the much emphasised idea of freedom and the less easily realised\r\nideals of equality and fraternity, was the conception of the worth and\r\ndignity of labour. Though Owen was most largely influenced by the former\r\nand Saint-Simon and Fourier by the latter, it is certain that all three\r\nwere greatly affected by both the new movements. The motive power in\r\nOwen’s career was the philanthropy and humanitarianism of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. He had grown up in the midst of the industrial revolution; he\r\nwas one of the most successful pioneers in the improvement of the cotton\r\nmanufacture. No one could be more deeply conscious of the enormous\r\nabuses of the factory system; and no one better knew the wonderful\r\nservices that might be rendered by technical improvement if only it were\r\nmade subordinate to human well-being. In the career of Owen we see the\r\nnew spirit of the eighteenth century seeking to bring the mechanism of\r\nthe new industrial system under the direction of a nobler principle, in\r\nwhich the good of all should be the great and sole aim.\r\n\r\nThe position of Saint-Simon was considerably different, yet akin. As\r\nOwen had before his eyes the evils of a young but gigantic\r\nindustrialism, Saint-Simon contemplated the hoary abuses of an idle and\r\nprivileged feudalism, fearfully shaken no doubt by the Revolution, but\r\nstill strong in Europe, and in France, as elsewhere, powerfully revived\r\nduring the period after Waterloo. Saint-Simon saw that a new world, an\r\nindustrial world resting on labour, had arisen, while the old feudal and\r\ntheological world—_fainéant_ courtiers and a clergy steeped in\r\nignorance—still ruled. All this array of parasites, who had no longer\r\nany useful function to perform for society, Saint-Simon sought to\r\nreplace by the industrial chiefs and scientific leaders as the real\r\nworking heads of the French people. Only, he expected that these\r\nexceptionally gifted men, instead of exploiting the labour of others,\r\nshould control an industrial France for the general good.\r\n\r\nNeither Owen nor Saint-Simon was revolutionary in the ordinary sense.\r\nOwen was most anxious that the English and other Governments should\r\nadopt his projects of socialistic reform. Leading statesmen and royal\r\npersonages befriended him. He had no faith in the political reforms of\r\n1832; he reckoned the political side of chartism as of no account, and\r\nhe preferred socialistic experiment under autocratic guidance until the\r\nworkmen should be trained to rule themselves. The same autocratic\r\ntendency was very pronounced in Saint-Simon and his school. His first\r\nappeal was to Louis XVIII. He wished to supersede the feudal aristocracy\r\nby a working aristocracy of merit. His school claim to have been the\r\nfirst to warn the Governments of Europe of the rise of revolutionary\r\nsocialism. In short, the early socialism arose during the reaction\r\nconsequent on the wars of the French Revolution, and was influenced by\r\nthe political tendencies of the time.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of socialism may be dated from 1817, the year when Owen\r\nlaid his scheme for a socialistic community before the committee of the\r\nHouse of Commons on the poor law, the year also that the speculations of\r\nSaint-Simon definitely took a socialistic direction. The outlines of the\r\nhistory of socialism are very simple. Till 1850 there was a double\r\nmovement in France and England. In the former country, after Saint-Simon\r\nand Fourier the movement was represented chiefly by Proudhon and Louis\r\nBlanc. In England, after Owen the movement was taken up by the body of\r\nChristian socialists associated with Maurice and Kingsley.\r\n\r\nDuring the next stage in the development of socialism we see the\r\ninfluence chiefly of German and also Russian thinkers, but it is\r\ngenerally international both in its principles and sympathies. The\r\nprevalent socialism found its first expression in the manifesto of the\r\nCommunist Party published in 1848. The same views were elaborated by\r\nMarx in his _Kapital_ (1867), and have in later times been consolidated\r\nand modified by many writers in many lands, in the programmes of\r\nnational parties and in the resolutions of international congresses.\r\n\r\nIn this Introduction we have tried to give a preliminary conception of\r\nour subject, and we shall now proceed to present the leading views of\r\nthe men who have taken the chief part in originating and guiding the\r\nsocialist movement.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[1] Holyoake, _History of Co-operation_, vol. i. p. 210, ed. 1875.\r\n\r\n[2] Quoted by Adolf Held, _Sozialismus, Sozialdemokratie und\r\nSozialpolitik_, p. 30.\r\n\r\n[3] _Ibid._ p. 29.\r\n\r\n[4] _Les origines du socialisme contemporain_, p. 67.\r\n\r\n[5] _Le socialisme contemporain_, p. iv.\r\n\r\n[6] Schönberg’s _Handbuch der pol.

They had an excessive faith in the\r\npossibilities of human progress and perfectibility; they knew little of\r\nthe true laws of social evolution—in fact, did not sufficiently\r\nrecognise those aspects of life which Darwinism has brought out so\r\nclearly. These faults the early socialists shared with many other\r\nthinkers of the time in which they lived.\r\n\r\nComte Henri de Saint-Simon, the founder of French socialism, was born at\r\nParis in 1760. He belonged to a younger branch of the family of the\r\ncelebrated duke of that name. His education, he tells us, was directed\r\nby d’Alembert. At the age of nineteen he went as volunteer to assist the\r\nAmerican colonies in their revolt against Britain.\r\n\r\nFrom his youth Saint-Simon felt the promptings of an eager ambition. His\r\nvalet had orders to awake him every morning with the words, ‘Remember,\r\nmonsieur le comte, that you have great things to do’; and his ancestor\r\nCharlemagne appeared to him in a dream, foretelling a remarkable future\r\nfor him. Among his early schemes was one to unite the Atlantic and the\r\nPacific by a canal, and another to construct a canal from Madrid to the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nHe took no part of any importance in the French Revolution, but amassed\r\na little fortune by land speculation—not on his own account, however,\r\nas he said, but to facilitate his future projects. Accordingly, when he\r\nwas nearly forty years of age he went through a varied course of study\r\nand experiment, in order to enlarge and clarify his view of things. One\r\nof these experiments was an unhappy marriage, which after a year’s\r\nduration was dissolved by the mutual consent of the parties. Another\r\nresult of his experiments was that he found himself completely\r\nimpoverished, and lived in penury for the remainder of his life.\r\n\r\nThe first of his numerous writings, _Lettres d’un Habitant de Genève_,\r\nappeared in 1803; but his early works were mostly scientific and\r\npolitical. It was not till 1817 that he began, in a treatise entitled\r\n_L’Industrie_, to propound his socialistic views, which he further\r\ndeveloped in _L’Organisateur_ (1819), _Du Système industrial_ (1821),\r\n_Catéchisme des Industriels_ (1823). The last and most important\r\nexpression of his views is the _Nouveau Christianisme_ (1825).\r\n\r\nFor many years before his death in 1825 Saint-Simon had been reduced to\r\nthe greatest straits. He was obliged to accept a laborious post for a\r\nsalary of £40 a year, to live on the generosity of a former valet, and\r\nfinally to solicit a small pension from his family. In 1823 he attempted\r\nsuicide in despair. It was not till very late in his career that he\r\nattached to himself a few ardent disciples.\r\n\r\nAs a thinker Saint-Simon was entirely deficient in system, clearness,\r\nand consecutive strength. His writings are largely made up of a few\r\nideas continually repeated. But his speculations are always ingenious\r\nand original; and he has unquestionably exercised great influence on\r\nmodern thought, both as the historic founder of French socialism and as\r\nsuggesting much of what was afterwards elaborated into Comtism.\r\n\r\nApart from the details of his socialistic teaching, with which we need\r\nnot concern ourselves, we find that the ideas of Saint-Simon with regard\r\nto the reconstruction of society are very simple. His opinions were\r\nconditioned by the French Revolution and by the feudal and military\r\nsystem still prevalent in France. In opposition to the destructive\r\nliberalism of the Revolution he insisted on the necessity of a new and\r\npositive reorganisation of society. So far was he from advocating social\r\nrevolt that he appealed to Louis XVIII. to inaugurate the new order of\r\nthings. In opposition, however, to the feudal and military system, the\r\nformer aspect of which had been strengthened by the Restoration, he\r\nadvocated an arrangement by which the industrial chiefs should control\r\nsociety. In place of the Mediæval Church, the spiritual direction of\r\nsociety should fall to the men of science. What Saint-Simon desired,\r\ntherefore, was an industrialist State directed by modern science. The\r\nmen who are best fitted to organise society for productive labour are\r\nentitled to bear rule in it.\r\n\r\nThe social aim is to produce things useful to life; the final end of\r\nsocial activity is ‘the exploitation of the globe by association.’ The\r\ncontrast between labour and capital, so much emphasised by later\r\nsocialism, is not present to Saint-Simon, but it is assumed that the\r\nindustrial chiefs, to whom the control of production is to be committed,\r\nshall rule in the interest of society. Later on, the cause of the poor\r\nreceives greater attention, till in his greatest work, _The New\r\nChristianity_, it becomes the central point of his teaching, and takes\r\nthe form of a religion. It was this religious development of his\r\nteaching that occasioned his final quarrel with Comte.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the publication of the _Nouveau Christianisme_ Saint-Simon\r\nhad not concerned himself with theology. Here he starts from a belief in\r\nGod, and his object in the treatise is to reduce Christianity to its\r\nsimple and essential elements. He does this by clearing it of the dogmas\r\nand other excrescences and defects that have gathered round both the\r\nCatholic and Protestant forms of it, which he subjects to a searching\r\nand ingenious criticism. The moral doctrine will by the new faith be\r\nconsidered the most important; the divine element in Christianity is\r\ncontained in the precept that men should act towards one another as\r\nbrethren. ‘The new Christian organisation will deduce the temporal\r\ninstitutions as well as the spiritual from the principle that all men\r\nshould act towards one another as brethren.’ Expressing the same idea in\r\nmodern language, Saint-Simon propounds as the comprehensive formula of\r\nthe new Christianity this precept: ‘The whole of society ought to strive\r\ntowards the amelioration of the moral and physical existence of the\r\npoorest class; society ought to organise itself in the way best adapted\r\nfor attaining this end.’ This principle became the watchword of the\r\nentire school of Saint-Simon; for them it was alike the essence of\r\nreligion and the programme of social reform.\r\n\r\nDuring his lifetime the views of Saint-Simon had little influence, and\r\nhe left only a very few devoted disciples, who continued to advocate the\r\ndoctrines of their master, whom they revered as a prophet. An important\r\ndeparture was made in 1828 by Bazard, who gave a ‘complete exposition of\r\nthe Saint-Simonian faith’ in a long course of lectures in the Rue\r\nTaranne at Paris. In 1830 Bazard and Enfantin were acknowledged as the\r\nheads of the school; and the fermentation caused by the revolution of\r\nJuly of the same year brought the whole movement prominently before the\r\nattention of France. Early next year the school obtained possession of\r\nthe _Globe_ through Pierre Leroux, who had joined the party, which now\r\nnumbered some of the ablest and most promising young men of France, many\r\nof the pupils of the École Polytechnique having caught its enthusiasm.\r\nThe members formed themselves into an association arranged in three\r\ngrades, and constituting a society or family, which lived out of a\r\ncommon purse in the Rue Monsigny.\r\n\r\nBefore long, however, dissensions began to arise in the sect. Bazard, a\r\nman of logical and more solid temperament, could no longer work in\r\nharmony with Enfantin, who desired to establish an arrogant and\r\nfantastic sacerdotalism, with lax notions as to marriage and the\r\nrelations of the sexes. After a time Bazard seceded, and many of the\r\nstrongest supporters followed his example. A series of extravagant\r\nentertainments given by the society during the winter of 1832 reduced\r\nits financial resources and greatly discredited it in character. They\r\nfinally removed to Menilmontant, to a property of Enfantin, where they\r\nlived in a communistic society, distinguished by a peculiar dress.\r\nShortly afterwards the chiefs were tried and condemned for proceedings\r\nprejudicial to the social order; and the sect was entirely broken up in\r\n1832. Many of its members became famous as engineers, economists, and\r\nmen of business. The idea of constructing the Suez Canal, as carried out\r\nby Lesseps, proceeded from the school.\r\n\r\nIn the school of Saint-Simon we find a great advance both in the breadth\r\nand firmness with which the vague and confused views of the master are\r\ndeveloped; and this progress is due chiefly to Bazard. In the philosophy\r\nof history they recognise epochs of two kinds, the critical or negative,\r\nand the organic or constructive. The former, in which philosophy is the\r\ndominating force, is characterised by war, egotism, and anarchy; the\r\nlatter, which is controlled by religion, is marked by the spirit of\r\nobedience, devotion, association. The two spirits of antagonism and\r\nassociation are the two great social principles, and on the degree of\r\nprevalence of the two depends the character of an epoch. The spirit of\r\nassociation, however, tends more and more to prevail over its opponent,\r\nextending from the family to the city, from the city to the nation, and\r\nfrom the nation to the federation. This principle of association is to\r\nbe the keynote of the social development of the future. Hitherto the law\r\nof humanity has been the ‘exploitation of man by man’ in its three\r\nstages—slavery, serfdom, the proletariat; in the future the aim must be\r\n‘the exploitation of the globe by man associated to man.’\r\n\r\nUnder the present system the industrial chief still exploits the\r\nproletariat, the members of which, though nominally free, must accept\r\nhis terms under pain of starvation. This state of things is consolidated\r\nby the law of inheritance, whereby the instruments of production, which\r\nare private property, and all the attendant social advantages, are\r\ntransmitted without regard to personal merit. The social disadvantages\r\nbeing also transmitted, misery becomes hereditary. The only remedy for\r\nthis is the abolition of the law of inheritance, and the union of all\r\nthe instruments of labour in a social fund, which shall be exploited by\r\nassociation. Society thus becomes sole proprietor, entrusting to social\r\ngroups or social functionaries the management of the various properties.\r\nThe right of succession is transferred from the family to the State.\r\n\r\nThe school of Saint-Simon insists strongly on the claims of merit; they\r\nadvocate a social hierarchy in which each man shall be placed according\r\nto his capacity and rewarded according to his works. This is, indeed, a\r\nmost special and pronounced feature of the Saint-Simon Socialism, whose\r\ntheory of government is a kind of spiritual or scientific autocracy,\r\nculminating in the fantastic sacerdotalism of Enfantin.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the family and the relation of the sexes, the school of\r\nSaint-Simon advocated the complete emancipation of woman and her entire\r\nequality with man. The ‘social individual’ is man and woman, who are\r\nassociated in the triple function of religion, the State, and the\r\nfamily. In its official declarations the school maintained the sanctity\r\nof the Christian law of marriage. On this point Enfantin fell into a\r\nprurient and fantastic latitudinarianism, which made the school a\r\nscandal to France, but many of the most prominent members besides Bazard\r\nrefused to follow him.\r\n\r\nConnected with the last-mentioned doctrines was their famous theory of\r\nthe ‘rehabilitation of the flesh,’ deduced from the philosophic theory\r\nof the school, which was a species of pantheism, though they repudiated\r\nthe name. On this theory they rejected the dualism so much emphasised by\r\nCatholic Christianity in its penances and mortifications, and held that\r\nthe body should be restored to its due place of honour. It is a vague\r\nprinciple, of which the ethical character depends on the interpretation;\r\nand it was variously interpreted in the school of Saint-Simon. It was\r\ncertainly immoral as held by Enfantin, by whom it was developed into a\r\nkind of sensual mysticism, a system of free love with a religious\r\nsanction.[1]\r\n\r\nThe good and bad aspects of the Saint-Simon socialism are too obvious to\r\nrequire elucidation. The antagonism between the old economic order and\r\nthe new had only begun to declare itself. The extent and violence of the\r\ndisease were not yet apparent: both diagnosis and remedy were\r\nsuperficial and premature. Such deep-seated organic disorder was not to\r\nbe conjured away by the waving of a magic wand. The movement was all too\r\nutopian and extravagant in much of its activity. The most prominent\r\nportion of the school attacked social order in its essential point—the\r\nfamily morality—adopting the worst features of a fantastic, arrogant,\r\nand prurient sacerdotalism, and parading them in the face of Europe.\r\nThus it happened that a school which attracted so many of the most\r\nbrilliant and promising young men of France, which was so striking and\r\noriginal in its criticism of the existing condition of things, which was\r\nso strong in the spirit of initiative, and was in many ways so noble,\r\nunselfish, and aspiring, sank amidst the laughter and indignation of a\r\nscandalised society.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[1] An excellent edition of the works of Saint-Simon and Enfantin was\r\nbegun by survivors of the sect in (Paris) 1865, and now numbers forty\r\nvols. See Reybaud, _Études sur les réformateurs modernes_ (7th edition,\r\nParis 1864); Janet, _Saint-Simon et le Saint-Simonisme_ (Paris, 1878);\r\nA. J. Booth, _Saint-Simon and Saint-Simonism_ (London, 1871).\r\n\r\n                               _FOURIER_\r\n\r\nConsidered as a purely literary and speculative product, the socialism\r\nof Fourier was prior to those both of Owen and Saint-Simon. Fourier’s\r\nfirst work, _Théorie des Quatre Movements_, was published as early as\r\n1808. His system, however, scarcely attracted any attention and\r\nexercised no influence till the movements originated by Owen and\r\nSaint-Simon had begun to decline.\r\n\r\nThe socialism of Fourier is in many respects fundamentally different\r\nfrom that of Saint-Simon; in the two schools, in fact, we find the two\r\nopposing types of socialism which have continued to prevail ever since.\r\nSaint-Simonism represented the principle of authority, of\r\ncentralisation; while Fourier made all possible provision for local and\r\nindividual freedom. With Saint-Simonism the State is the starting-point,\r\nthe normal and dominant power; in Fourier the like position is held by a\r\nlocal body, corresponding to the commune, which he called the\r\n_Phalange_. In the system of Fourier the _phalange_ holds the supreme\r\nand central place, other organisation in comparison with it being\r\nsecondary and subordinate.\r\n\r\nThe deviser of the _phalange_, François Marie Charles Fourier[1] was a\r\nvery remarkable man. He was born at Besançon in 1772, and received from\r\nhis father, a prosperous draper, an excellent education at the academy\r\nof his native town. The boy excelled in the studies of the school, and\r\nregretfully abandoned them for a business career, which he followed in\r\nvarious towns of France. As a commercial traveller in Holland and\r\nGermany he enlarged his experience of men and things. From his father\r\nFourier inherited a sum of about £3000, with which he started business\r\nat Lyons, but he lost all he had in the siege of that city by the\r\nJacobins during the Reign of Terror, was thrown into prison, and\r\nnarrowly escaped the guillotine. On his release he joined the army for\r\ntwo years, and then returned to his old way of life.\r\n\r\nAt a very early age Fourier had his attention called to the defects of\r\nthe prevalent commercial system. When only five years old he had been\r\npunished for speaking the truth about certain goods in his father’s\r\nshop; and at the age of twenty-seven he had at Marseilles to superintend\r\nthe destruction of an immense quantity of rice held for higher prices\r\nduring a scarcity of food till it had become unfit for use. The\r\nconviction grew within him that a system which involved such abuses and\r\nimmoralities must be radically evil. Feeling that it was his mission to\r\nfind a remedy for it, he spent his life in the discovery, elucidation,\r\nand propagation of a better order; and he brought to his task a\r\nself-denial and singleness of purpose which have seldom been surpassed.\r\nFor the last ten years of his life he waited in his apartments at noon\r\nevery day for the wealthy capitalist who should supply the means for the\r\nrealisation of his schemes. The tangible success obtained by his system\r\nwas very slight. His works found few readers and still fewer disciples.\r\n\r\nIt was chiefly after the decline of the Saint-Simon movement that he\r\ngained a hearing and a little, success. A small group of enthusiastic\r\nadherents gathered round him; a journal was started for the propagation\r\nof his views; and in 1832 an attempt was made on lands near Versailles\r\nto establish a _phalange_, which, however, proved a total failure. In\r\n1837 Fourier passed away from a world that showed little inclination to\r\nlisten to his teaching. A singular altruism was in his character blended\r\nwith the most sanguine confidence in the possibilities of human\r\nprogress. Perhaps the weakest point in his teaching was that he so\r\ngreatly underestimated the strength of the unregenerate residuum in\r\nhuman nature. His own life was a model of simplicity, integrity,\r\nkindliness, and disinterested devotion to what he deemed the highest\r\naims.\r\n\r\nThe social system of Fourier was, we need not say, the central point in\r\nhis speculations. But as his social system was moulded and coloured by\r\nhis peculiar views on theology, cosmogony, and psychology, we must give\r\nsome account of those aspects of his teaching. In theology Fourier\r\ninclined, though not decidedly, to what is called pantheism; the\r\npantheistic conception of the world which underlay the Saint-Simon\r\ntheory of the ‘rehabilitation of the flesh’ may be said to form the\r\nbasis also of the social ethics and arrangements of Fourier. Along with\r\nthis he held a natural optimism of the most radical and comprehensive\r\ncharacter. God has done all things well, only man has misunderstood and\r\nthwarted His benevolent purposes. God pervades everything as a universal\r\nattraction. Whereas Newton discovered that the law of attraction governs\r\none movement of the world, Fourier shows that it is universal, ruling\r\nthe world in all its movements, which are four—material, organic,\r\nintellectual, and social. It is the same law of attraction which\r\npervades all things, from the cosmic harmony of the stars down to the\r\npuny life of the minutest insect, and which would reign also in the\r\nhuman soul and in human society, if the intentions of the Creator were\r\nunderstood. In the elucidation of his system Fourier’s aim simply is to\r\ninterpret the intentions of the Creator. He regards his philosophy, not\r\nas ingenious guesses or speculations, but as discoveries plainly\r\ntraceable from a few first principles; discoveries in no way doubtful,\r\nbut the fruit of clear insight into the divine law.\r\n\r\nThe cosmogony of Fourier is the most fantastic part of a fantastic\r\nsystem. But as he did not consider his views in this department an\r\nessential part of his system, we need not dwell upon them. He believed\r\nthat the world is to exist for eighty thousand years, forty thousand\r\nyears of progress being followed by forty thousand years of decline. As\r\nyet it has not reached the adult stage, having lasted only seven\r\nthousand years. The present stage of the world is civilisation, which\r\nFourier uses as a comprehensive term for everything artificial and\r\ncorrupt, the result of perverted human institutions, themselves due to\r\nthe fact that we have for five thousand years misunderstood the\r\nintentions of the Creator. The head and front of this misunderstanding\r\nconsists in our pronouncing passions to be bad that are simply natural;\r\nand there is but one way of redressing it—to give a free and healthy\r\nand complete development to our passions.\r\n\r\nThis leads us to the psychology of Fourier. He recognised twelve radical\r\npassions connected with three points of attraction. Five are sensitive\r\n(tending to enjoyment)—sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch. Four\r\nare affective (tending to groups)—love, friendship, ambition, and\r\n_familism_ or paternity. The meaning and function of these are obvious\r\nenough. The remaining three, the _alternating_, _emulative_, and\r\n_composite_ (which he calls _passions rectrices_, and which tend to\r\nseries or to unity), are more special to Fourier. Of the three the first\r\nis connected with the need of variety; the second leads to intrigue and\r\njealousy; the third, full of intoxication and abandonment, is born of\r\nthe combination of several pleasures of the senses and of the soul\r\nenjoyed simultaneously. The passions of the first two classes are so far\r\ncontrolled by the _passions rectrices_, and especially by the composite\r\npassion; but even the _passions rectrices_ obviously contain elements of\r\ndiscord and war. All, however, are ultimately harmonised by a great\r\nsocial passion, which Fourier calls _Unitéisme_. Out of the free play of\r\nall the passions harmony is evolved, like white out of the combination\r\nof the colours.\r\n\r\nThe speedy passage from social chaos to universal harmony contemplated\r\nby Fourier can, as we have seen, be accomplished only by one method, by\r\ngiving to the human passions their natural development. For this end, a\r\ncomplete break with civilisation must be made. We must have new social\r\narrangements suitable to human nature and in harmony with the intentions\r\nof the Creator. These Fourier provides in the _phalange_. In its normal\r\nform the _phalange_ was to consist of four hundred families or eighteen\r\nhundred persons, living on a square league of land, self-contained and\r\nself-sufficing for the most part, and combining within itself the means\r\nfor the free development of the most varied likings and capacities. It\r\nwas an institution in which agriculture, industry, the appliances and\r\nopportunities of enjoyment, and generally of the widest and freest human\r\ndevelopment, are combined, the interests of individual freedom and of\r\ncommon union being reconciled in a way hitherto unknown and unimagined.\r\n\r\nWhile the _phalange_ is the social unit, the individuals composing it\r\nwill arrange themselves in groups of seven or nine persons; from\r\ntwenty-four to thirty-two groups form a series, and these unite to form\r\na _phalange_—all according to principles of attraction, of free\r\nelective affinity. The dwelling of the _phalange_ was the _phalanstère_,\r\na vast, beautiful, and commodious structure, where life could be\r\narranged to suit every one, common or solitary, according to preference;\r\nbut under such conditions there would be neither excuse nor motive for\r\nthe selfish seclusion, isolation, and suspicion so prevalent in\r\ncivilisation.\r\n\r\nIn such an institution it is obvious that government under the form of\r\ncompulsion and restraint would be reduced to a minimum. The officials of\r\nthe _phalange_ would be elected. The _phalange_, itself was an\r\nexperiment on a local scale, which could easily be made, and once\r\nsuccessfully made would lead to world-wide imitation. They would freely\r\ngroup themselves into wider combinations with elected chiefs, and the\r\n_phalanges_ of the whole world would form a great federation with a\r\nsingle elected chief, resident at Constantinople, which would be the\r\nuniversal capital.\r\n\r\nIn all the arrangements of the _phalange_ the principle of free\r\nattraction would be observed. Love would be free. Free unions should be\r\nformed, which could be dissolved, or which might grow into permanent\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nThe labour of the _phalange_ would be conducted on scientific methods;\r\nbut it would, above all things, be made _attractive_, by consulting the\r\nlikings and capacities of the members, by frequent change of occupation,\r\nby recourse to the principle of emulation in individuals, groups, and\r\nseries. On the principle that men and women are eager for the greatest\r\nexertion, if only they like it, Fourier bases his theory that all labour\r\ncan be made attractive by appealing to appropriate motives in human\r\nnature. Obviously, also, what is now the most disgusting labour could be\r\nmore effectually performed by machinery.\r\n\r\nThe product of labour was to be distributed in the following\r\nmanner:—Out of the common gain of the _phalange_ a very comfortable\r\nminimum was assured to every member. Of the remainder, five-twelfths\r\nwent to labour, four-twelfths to capital, and three-twelfths to talent.\r\nIn the _phalange_, individual capital existed, and inequality of talent\r\nwas not only admitted, but insisted upon and utilised. In the actual\r\ndistribution the _phalange_ treated with individuals. With regard to the\r\nremuneration of individuals under the head of capital no difficulty\r\ncould be felt, as a normal rate of interest would be given on the\r\nadvances made. Individual talent would be rewarded in accordance with\r\nthe services rendered in the management of the _phalange_, the place of\r\neach being determined by election. Labour would be remunerated on a\r\nprinciple entirely different from the present. Hard and common or\r\nnecessary work should be best paid; useful work should come next, and\r\npleasant work last of all. In any case the reward of labour would be so\r\ngreat that every one would have the opportunity of becoming a\r\ncapitalist.\r\n\r\nOne of the most notable results of the _phalange_ treating with each\r\nmember individually is, that the economic independence of women would be\r\nassured. Even the child of five would have its own share in the produce.\r\n\r\nThe system of Fourier may fairly be described as one of the most\r\ningenious and elaborate Utopias ever devised by the human brain. But in\r\nmany cardinal points it has been constructed in complete contradiction\r\nto all that experience and science have taught us of human nature and\r\nthe laws of social evolution. He particularly underestimates the force\r\nof human egotism. From the beginning progress has consisted essentially\r\nin the hard and strenuous repression of the beast within the man,\r\nwhereas Fourier would give it free rein. This applies to his system as a\r\nwhole, and especially to his theories on marriage. Instead of supplying\r\na sudden passage from social chaos to universal harmony, his system\r\nwould, after entirely subverting such order as we have, only bring us\r\nback to social chaos.\r\n\r\nYet his works are full of suggestion and instruction, and will long\r\nrepay the study of the social economist. His criticisms of the existing\r\nsystem, of its waste, anarchy, and immorality, are ingenious, searching,\r\nand often most convincing. In his positive proposals, too, are to be\r\nfound some of the most sagacious and far-reaching forecasts of the\r\nfuture landmarks of human progress. Most noteworthy are the guarantees\r\nhe devised for individual and local freedom. The _phalange_ was on the\r\none hand large enough to secure all the benefits of a scientific\r\nindustry and of a varied common life; on the other it provides against\r\nthe evils of centralisation, of State despotism, of false patriotism and\r\nnational jealousy. Fourier has forecast the part to be played in the\r\nsocial and political development of the future by the local body,\r\nwhether we call it commune, parish, or municipality. The fact that he\r\nhas given it a fantastic name, and surrounded it with many fantastic\r\nconditions, should not hinder us from recognising his great sagacity and\r\noriginality.\r\n\r\nThe freedom of the individual and of the minority is, moreover,\r\nprotected against the possible tyranny of the _phalange_ by the\r\nexistence, under reasonable limits and under social control, of\r\nindividual capital. This individual capital, further, is perfectly\r\n_mobile_; that is, the possessor of it, if he thinks fit to migrate or\r\ngo on travel, may remove his capital, and find a welcome for his labour,\r\ntalent, and investments in any part of the world. Such arrangements of\r\nFourier may suggest a much-needed lesson to many of the contemporary\r\nadherents of ‘scientific socialism.’\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, we believe that Fourier’s system was as a whole\r\nentirely utopian, he has with great sagacity drawn the outlines of much\r\nof our political and social progress; and while we believe that the full\r\ndevelopment of human passions as recommended by him would soon reduce us\r\nto social chaos, a time may come in our ethical and rational growth when\r\na widening freedom may be permitted and exercised, not by casting off\r\nmoral law, but by the perfect assimilation of it.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[1] Fourier’s complete works (6 vols., Paris, 1840-46; new ed. 1870).\r\nThe most eminent expounder of Fourierism was Victor Considérant,\r\n_Destinée sociale_; Gatti de Gammont’s _Fourier et son système_ is an\r\nexcellent summary.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                        FRENCH SOCIALISM OF 1848\r\n\r\nThe year 1830 was an important era in the history of socialism. During\r\nthe fermentation of that time the activity of the Saint-Simon school\r\ncame to a crisis, and the theories of Fourier had an opportunity of\r\ntaking practical shape. But by far the greatest result for socialism of\r\nthe revolutionary period of 1830 was the definite establishment of the\r\ncontrast between the _bourgeoisie_ and proletariat in France and\r\nEngland, the two countries that held the foremost place in the modern\r\nindustrial, social, and political movement. Hitherto the men who were\r\nafterwards destined consciously to constitute those two classes had\r\nfought side by side against feudalism and the reaction. Through the\r\nrestricted franchise introduced at this period in the two countries just\r\nmentioned the middle class had become the ruling power.\r\n\r\nExcluded from political privileges and pressed by the weight of adverse\r\neconomic, conditions, the proletariat now appeared as the revolutionary\r\nparty. The first symptom in France of the altered state of things was\r\nthe outbreak at Lyons in 1831, when the starving workmen rose to arms\r\nwith the device, ‘Live working, or die fighting.’ Chartism was a larger\r\nphase of the same movement in England. The theories of Saint-Simon and\r\nFourier had met with acceptance chiefly or entirely among the educated\r\nclasses. Socialism now directly appealed to the working men.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter our concern is with the development of the new form of\r\nsocialism in France. Paris, which had so long been the centre of\r\nrevolutionary activity, was now, and particularly during the latter half\r\nof the reign of the _bourgeois_ King, Louis Philippe, the seat of\r\nsocialistic fermentation. In 1839 Louis Blanc published his\r\n_Organisation du travail_, and Cabet his _Voyage en Icarie_. In 1840\r\nProudhon brought out his book on property. Paris was the school to which\r\nyouthful innovators went to learn the lesson of revolution. At this\r\nperiod she counted among her visitors Lassalle, the founder of the\r\nSocial Democracy of Germany; Karl Marx, the chief of scientific\r\ninternational socialism; and Bakunin, the apostle of anarchism.\r\n\r\nThe socialistic speculation associated with the three men last mentioned\r\nwas to have a far-reaching influence; but it did not attain to full\r\ndevelopment till a later period. The socialistic activity of Louis Blanc\r\nand Proudhon culminated during the revolution of 1848, and exercised\r\nconsiderable influence on the course of events in Paris at that time.\r\n\r\n                             _LOUIS BLANC_\r\n\r\nThe socialism of Saint-Simon and Fourier was, as we have seen, largely\r\nimaginative and Utopian, and had only a very remote connection with the\r\npractical life of their time. With Louis Blanc the movement came into\r\nreal contact with the national history of France. In Louis Blanc’s\r\nteaching the most conspicuous feature was that he demanded the\r\ndemocratic organisation of the State as preparatory to social\r\nreorganisation. His system, therefore, had a positive and practical\r\nbasis, in so far as it allied itself to a dominant tendency in the\r\nexisting State.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary here to recapitulate in detail the life of Louis\r\nBlanc. He was born in 1811 at Madrid, where his father was\r\ninspector-general of finance under Joseph during his uncertain tenure of\r\nthe Spanish throne. At an early age he attained to eminence as a\r\njournalist in Paris, and in 1839 established the _Revue du progrès_, in\r\nwhich he first brought out his celebrated work on Socialism, the\r\n_Organisation du travail_. It was soon published in book form, and found\r\na wide popularity among the workmen of France, who were captivated by\r\nthe brilliancy of the style, the fervid eloquence with which it exposed\r\nexisting abuses, and the simplicity and democratic fitness of the\r\nschemes for the regeneration of society which it advocated.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the book is taken up with unsparing denunciations of\r\nthe evils of competition, which, as common to Louis Blanc with other\r\nsocialists, need not detain us. More interesting are the practical\r\nmeasures for their removal, proposed in his treatise.[1] Like the\r\nsocialists that preceded him, L. Blanc cannot accept the views which\r\nteach a necessary antagonism between soul and body; we must aim at the\r\nharmonious development of both sides of our nature. The formula of\r\nprogress is double in its unity: moral and material amelioration of the\r\nlot of all by the free co-operation of all, and their fraternal\r\nassociation.[2] He saw, however, that social reform could not be\r\nattained without political reform. The first is the end, the second is\r\nthe means. It was not enough to discover the true methods for\r\ninaugurating the principle of association and for organising labour in\r\naccordance with the rules of reason, justice, and humanity. It was\r\nnecessary to have political power on the side of social reform,\r\npolitical power resting on the Chambers, on the tribunals, and on the\r\narmy: not to take it as an instrument was to meet it as an obstacle.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons he wished to see the State constituted on a thoroughly\r\ndemocratic basis, as the first condition of success. The emancipation of\r\nthe proletarians was a question so difficult that it would require the\r\nwhole force of the State for its solution. What is wanting to the\r\nworking class are the instruments of labour; the function of Government\r\nis to furnish them. If we had to define what we consider the State to\r\nbe, we should reply, ‘The State is the banker of the poor.’\r\n\r\nLouis Blanc demanded that the democratic State should create industrial\r\nassociations, which he called _social workshops_, and which were\r\ndestined gradually and without shock to supersede individual workshops.\r\nThe State would provide the means; it would draw up the rules for their\r\nconstitution, and it would appoint the functionaries for the first year.\r\nBut, once founded and set in movement, the social workshop would be\r\nself-supporting, self-acting, and self-governing. The workmen would\r\nchoose their own directors and managers, they would themselves arrange\r\nthe division of the profits, and would take measures to extend the\r\nenterprise commenced.\r\n\r\nIn such a system where would there be room for arbitrary rule or\r\ntyranny? The State would establish the social workshops, would pass laws\r\nfor them, and supervise their execution for the good of all; but its\r\n_rôle_ would end there. Is this, can this be tyranny? Thus the freedom\r\nof the industrial associations and of the individuals composing them\r\nwould not only remain intact; it would have the solid support of the\r\nState. The intervention of a democratic Government on behalf of the\r\npeople, whom it represented, would remove the misery, anarchy, and\r\noppression necessarily attendant on the competitive system, and in place\r\nof the delusive liberty of _laissez-faire_, would establish a real and\r\npositive freedom.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the remuneration of talent and labour L. Blanc takes very\r\nhigh ground. ‘Genius,’ he said, ‘should assert its legitimate empire,\r\nnot by the amount of the tribute which it will levy on society, but by\r\nthe greatness of the services which it will render.’ This is no mere\r\nflourish of eloquence; it is to be the principle of remuneration in his\r\nassociation. Society could not, even if it would, repay the genius of a\r\nNewton; Newton had his just recompense in the joy of discovering the\r\nlaws by which worlds are governed. Exceptional endowments must find\r\ndevelopment and a fitting reward in the exceptional services they render\r\nto society.\r\n\r\nL. Blanc therefore believed in a hierarchy according to capacity;\r\nremuneration according to capacity he admitted in the earlier editions\r\nof his work, but only provisionally and as a concession to prevalent\r\nanti-social opinion. In the edition of 1848, the year when his theories\r\nattained for a time to historic importance, he had withdrawn this\r\nconcession. ‘Though the false and anti-social education given to the\r\npresent generation makes it difficult to find any other motive of\r\nemulation and encouragement than a higher salary, the wages will be\r\nequal, as the ideas and character of men will be changed by an\r\nabsolutely new education.’[3] Private capitalists would be invited to\r\njoin the associations, and would under fixed conditions receive interest\r\nfor their advances; but as the collective capital increased, the\r\nopportunities for so placing individual capital would surely diminish.\r\nThe tyranny of capital would, in fact, receive a mortal wound.\r\n\r\nThe revolution of 1848 was an important stage in the development of\r\ndemocracy. In ancient and also in mediæval times the democracy was\r\nassociated with city life; the citizens personally appeared and spoke\r\nand voted in the Assemblies. The modern democracy has grown in large\r\nStates, extending over wide territories, and the citizen can exercise\r\npolitical power only through elected representatives. Hence the\r\nimportance of the franchise in modern politics. The evolution of the\r\nmodern democracy has gone through a long succession of phases, beginning\r\nwith the early growth of the English Parliament, and continued in the\r\nstruggles of the Dutch against the Spaniards, in the English Revolutions\r\nof 1642 and 1688, in the American Revolution of 1776, and the French\r\nRevolution of 1789. In the early struggles, however, the mass of the\r\npeople had no very great share. It was hardly till 1848 that the working\r\nclass made its entrance on the stage of history—in Europe at least.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary disturbances of 1848 affected nearly the whole of\r\nwestern and central Europe. It was a rising of the peoples against\r\nantiquated political forms and institutions; against the arrangements of\r\nthe Treaty of Vienna, whereby Europe was partitioned according to the\r\nconvenience of ruling houses; against irresponsible Governments, which\r\ntook no account of the wishes of their subjects.\r\n\r\nIn France, the country with which we are now specially concerned, the\r\nrevolution was a revolt of the people against a representative monarchy\r\nwith a very restricted franchise. It was not a deeply-planned rising,\r\nand, indeed, was a surprise to those who wished it and accomplished it.\r\nYet it marked a most important stage in the progress of the world, for,\r\nas a result of it, men for the first time saw the legislature of a great\r\ncountry established on principles of universal suffrage, and the cause\r\nof the working men recognised as a supreme duty of government.\r\n\r\nLouis Blanc was the most prominent actor in what may be called the\r\nsocial-democratic side of the French Revolution of 1848. Through his\r\ninfluence with the working classes, and as representing their feelings\r\nand aspirations, he obtained a place in the Provisional Government. He\r\nwas supported there by others like-minded with himself, including one\r\nworking man, whose appearance in such a capacity was also a notable\r\nevent in modern history. But though circumstances were so far\r\nfavourable, he did not accomplish much. It cannot be said that his plans\r\nobtained a fair hearing or a fair trial. He was present in the\r\nProvisional Government as the pioneer of a new cause whose time had not\r\nyet come.\r\n\r\nThe schemes for social reconstruction which he contemplated were\r\ncertainly not carried out in the _national workshops_ of that year. From\r\nthe report of the Commission of Inquiry into the subject, subsequently\r\ninstituted by the French Government, and from the _History of the\r\nNational Workshops_, written by their director, Emile Thomas, it is\r\nperfectly clear that the _national workshops_ were simply a travesty of\r\nthe proposals of Louis Blanc, established expressly to discredit them.\r\nThey were a means of finding work for the motley proletariat thrown out\r\nof employment during the period of revolutionary disturbance, and those\r\nmen were put to unproductive labour; whereas, of course, Louis Blanc\r\ncontemplated nothing but productive work, and the men he proposed\r\ninviting to join his associations were to give guarantees of character.\r\nIt was intended, too, by his opponents that the mob of workmen whom they\r\nemployed in the so-called _national workshops_ would be ready to assist\r\ntheir masters in the event of a struggle with the socialist party.\r\n\r\nA number of private associations of a kind similar to those proposed by\r\nLouis Blanc were indeed subsidised by the Government. But of the whole\r\nsum voted for this end, which amounted to only £120,000, the greater\r\npart was applied to purposes quite foreign from the grant. It was not\r\nthe intention of the moving spirits of the Government that they should\r\nsucceed. Moreover, the months following the revolution of February were\r\na period of industrial stagnation and insecurity, when any project of\r\ntrade, either on the old or on the new lines, had little prospect of\r\nsuccess. Under these circumstances, the fact that a few of the\r\nassociations did prosper very fairly may be accepted as proof that the\r\nscheme of Louis Blanc had in it the elements of vitality. The history of\r\nthe whole matter fully justifies the exclamation of Lassalle that ‘lying\r\nis a European power.’[4] It has been the subject of endless\r\nmisrepresentation by writers who have taken no pains to verify the\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nAs one of the leaders during this difficult crisis, Louis Blanc had\r\nneither personal force nor enduring political influence sufficient to\r\nsecure any solid success for his cause. He was an amiable, genial, and\r\neloquent enthusiast, but without weight enough to be a controller of men\r\non a wide scale. The Labour Conferences at the Luxembourg, over which he\r\npresided, ended also, as his opponents desired, without any tangible\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly, elected on the principle of universal suffrage, which met\r\nin May, showed that the peasantry and the mass of the French people were\r\nnot in accord with the working classes of Paris and of the industrial\r\ncentres. It did not approve of the social-democratic activity urged by a\r\nsection of the Provisional Government. The national workshops also were\r\nclosed, and the proletariat of Paris rose in armed insurrection, which\r\nwas overthrown by Cavaignac in the sanguinary days of June. Louis Blanc\r\nwas in no way responsible for the revolt, which can be called\r\nsocialistic only in the sense that the proletariat was engaged in it,\r\nthe class of which socialism claims to be the special champion.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[1] _Organisation du travail._ Fifth edition. 1848.\r\n\r\n[2] Preface to fifth edition, _Organisation du travail_.\r\n\r\n[3] _Organisation du travail_, p. 103.\r\n\r\n[4] Lassalle, _Die französischen Nationalwerkstätten von 1848_.\r\n\r\n                               _PROUDHON_\r\n\r\nPierre Joseph Proudhon was born in 1809 at Besançon, France, the native\r\nplace also of the socialist Fourier. His origin was of the humblest, his\r\nfather being a brewer’s cooper, and the boy herded cows and did such\r\nother work as came in his way. But he was not entirely self-educated; at\r\nsixteen he entered the college of his native place, though his family\r\nwas so poor that he could not procure the necessary books, and had to\r\nborrow them from his mates in order to copy the lessons. There is a\r\nstory of the young Proudhon returning home laden with prizes, but to\r\nfind that there was no dinner for him.\r\n\r\nAt nineteen he became a working compositor, and was afterwards promoted\r\nto be a corrector for the press, reading proofs of ecclesiastical works,\r\nand thereby acquiring a considerable knowledge of theology. In this way\r\nhe also came to learn Hebrew, and to compare it with Greek, Latin, and\r\nFrench. It was the first proof of his intellectual audacity that on the\r\nstrength of this he wrote an _Essai de grammaire générale_. As Proudhon\r\nknew nothing whatever of the true principles of philology, his treatise\r\nwas of no value.\r\n\r\nIn 1838 he obtained the _pension Suard_, a bursary of 1500 francs a year\r\nfor three years, for the encouragement of young men of promise, which\r\nwas in the gift of the Academy of Besançon. Next year he wrote a\r\ntreatise _On the Utility of Keeping the Sunday_, which contained the\r\ngerms of his revolutionary ideas. About this time he went to Paris,\r\nwhere he lived a poor, ascetic, and studious life, making acquaintance,\r\nhowever, with the socialistic ideas which were then fermenting in the\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 he published his first work, _Qu’est-ce que la propriété?_ (What\r\nis Property?) His famous answer to this question, _La propriété c’est le\r\nvol_ (Property is theft), naturally did not please the academy of\r\nBesançon, and there was some talk of withdrawing his pension; but he\r\nheld it for the regular period.[1]\r\n\r\nFor his third memoir on property, which took the shape of a letter to\r\nthe Fourierist, M. Considérant, he was tried at Besançon, but was\r\nacquitted. In 1846 he published his greatest work, the _Système des\r\ncontradictions économiques, ou philosophie de la misère_. For some time\r\nProudhon carried on a small printing establishment at Besançon, but\r\nwithout success; and afterwards held a post as a kind of manager with a\r\ncommercial firm at Lyons. In 1847 he left this employment, and finally\r\nsettled in Paris, where he was now becoming celebrated as a leader of\r\ninnovation.\r\n\r\nHe regretted the sudden outbreak of the revolution of February, because\r\nit found the social reformers unprepared; but he threw himself with\r\nardour into the conflict of opinion, and soon gained a national\r\nnotoriety. He was the moving spirit of the _Représentant du Peuple_ and\r\nother journals, in which the most advanced theories were advocated in\r\nthe strongest language; and as member of Assembly for the Seine\r\ndepartment he brought forward his celebrated proposal for exacting an\r\nimpost of one-third on interest and rent, which of course was rejected.\r\nHis attempt to found a bank which should operate by granting gratuitous\r\ncredit, was also a complete failure; of the five million francs which he\r\nrequired, only seventeen thousand were offered. The violence of his\r\nutterances led to an imprisonment at Paris for three years, during which\r\nhe married a young working woman.\r\n\r\nAs Proudhon aimed at economic rather than political innovation, he had\r\nno special quarrel with the Second Empire, and he lived in comparative\r\nquiet under it till the publication of his work, _De la justice dans la\r\nrévolution et dans l’église_ (1858), in which he attacked the Church and\r\nother existing institutions with unusual fury. This time he fled to\r\nBrussels to escape imprisonment. On his return to France his health\r\nbroke down, though he continued to write. He died at Passy in 1865.\r\n\r\nPersonally, Proudhon was one of the most remarkable figures of modern\r\nFrance. His life was marked by the severest simplicity and even\r\npuritanism; he was affectionate in his domestic relations, a most loyal\r\nfriend, and strictly upright in conduct. He was strongly opposed to the\r\nprevailing French socialism of his time because of its utopianism and\r\nimmorality; and, though he uttered all manner of wild paradox and\r\nvehement invective against the dominant ideas and institutions, he was\r\nremarkably free from feelings of personal hate. In all that he said and\r\ndid he was the son of the people, who had not been broken to the usual\r\nsocial and academic discipline; hence his roughness, his one-sidedness,\r\nand his exaggerations. But he is always vigorous, and often brilliant\r\nand original.\r\n\r\nIt would obviously be impossible to reduce the ideas of such an\r\nirregular thinker to systematic form. In later years Proudhon himself\r\nconfessed that ‘the great part of his publications formed only a work of\r\ndissection and ventilation, so to speak, by means of which he slowly\r\nmakes his way towards a superior conception of political and economic\r\nlaws.’ Yet the groundwork of his teaching is clear and firm; no one\r\ncould insist with greater emphasis on the demonstrative character of\r\neconomic principles as understood by himself. He strongly believed in\r\nthe absolute truth of a few moral ideas, with which it was the aim of\r\nhis teaching to mould and suffuse political economy. Of these\r\nfundamental ideas, justice, liberty, and equality were the chief. What\r\nhe desiderated, for instance, in an ideal society was the most perfect\r\nequality of remuneration. It was his principle that service pays\r\nservice, that a day’s labour balances a day’s labour—in other words,\r\nthat the duration of labour is the just measure of value. He did not\r\nshrink from any of the consequences of this theory, for he would give\r\nthe same remuneration to the worst mason as to a Phidias; but he looks\r\nforward also to a period in human development when the present\r\ninequality in the talent and capacity of men would be reduced to an\r\ninappreciable minimum.\r\n\r\nFrom the great principle of service as the equivalent of service he\r\nderived his axiom that property is the right of _aubaine_. The _aubain_\r\nwas a stranger not naturalised; and the right of _aubaine_ was the right\r\nin virtue of which the Sovereign claimed the goods of such a stranger\r\nwho had died in his territory. Property is a right of the same nature,\r\nwith a like power of appropriation in the form of rent, interest, etc.\r\nIt reaps without labour, consumes without producing, and enjoys without\r\nexertion.\r\n\r\nProudhon’s aim, therefore, was to realise a science of society resting\r\non principles of justice, liberty, and equality thus understood; ‘a\r\nscience, absolute, rigorous, based on the nature of man and of his\r\nfaculties, and on their mutual relations; a science which we have not to\r\ninvent, but to discover.’ But he saw clearly that such ideas, with their\r\nnecessary accompaniments, could be realised only through a long and\r\nlaborious process of social transformation. As we have said, he strongly\r\ndetested the prurient immorality of the schools of Saint-Simon and\r\nFourier. He attacked them not less bitterly for thinking that society\r\ncould be changed off-hand by a ready-made and complete scheme of reform.\r\nIt was ‘the most accursed lie,’ he said, ‘that could be offered to\r\nmankind.’\r\n\r\nIn social change he distinguishes between the transition and the\r\nperfection or achievement. With regard to the transition he advocated\r\nthe progressive abolition of the right of _aubaine_, by reducing\r\ninterest, rent, etc. For the goal he professed only to give the general\r\nprinciples; he had no ready-made scheme, no Utopia. The positive\r\norganisation of the new society in its details was a labour that would\r\nrequire fifty Montesquieus. The organisation he desired was one on\r\ncollective principles, a free association which would take account of\r\nthe division of labour, and which would maintain the personality both of\r\nthe man and the citizen. With his strong and fervid feeling for human\r\ndignity and liberty, Proudhon could not have tolerated any theory of\r\nsocial change that did not give full scope for the free development of\r\nman. Connected with this was his famous paradox of _anarchy_, as the\r\ngoal of the free development of society, by which he meant that through\r\nthe ethical progress of men government should become unnecessary. Each\r\nman should be a law to himself. ‘Government of man by man in every\r\nform,’ he says, ‘is oppression. The highest perfection of society is\r\nfound in the union of order and _anarchy_.’\r\n\r\nProudhon’s theory of property as the right of _aubaine_ is substantially\r\nthe same as the theory of capital held by Marx and most of the later\r\nsocialists. Property and capital are defined and treated as the power of\r\nexploiting the labour of other men, of claiming the results of labour\r\nwithout giving an equivalent. Proudhon’s famous paradox, ‘Property is\r\ntheft,’ is merely a trenchant expression of this general principle. As\r\nslavery is assassination inasmuch as it destroys all that is valuable\r\nand desirable in human personality, so property is theft inasmuch as it\r\nappropriates the value produced by the labour of others in the form of\r\nrent, interest, or profit without rendering an equivalent. For property\r\nProudhon would substitute individual possession, the right of occupation\r\nbeing equal for all men.\r\n\r\nWith the bloodshed of the days of June French socialism ceased for a\r\ntime to be a considerable force; and Paris, too, for a time lost its\r\nplace as the great centre of innovation. The rising removed the most\r\nenterprising leaders of the workmen and quelled the spirit of the\r\nremainder, while the false prosperity of the Second Empire relieved\r\ntheir most urgent grievances. Under Napoleon III. there was consequently\r\ncomparative quietness in France. Even the International had very little\r\ninfluence on French soil, though French working men had an important\r\nshare in originating it.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[1] A complete edition of Proudhon’s works, including his posthumous\r\nwritings, was published at Paris, 1875. See _P. J. Proudhon, sa vie et\r\nsa correspondance_, by Sainte-Beuve (Paris, 1875), an admirable work,\r\nunhappily not completed; also _Revue des Deux Mondes_, Jan. 1866 and\r\nFeb. 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                        EARLY ENGLISH SOCIALISM\r\n\r\nCompared with the parallel movement in France the early socialism of\r\nEngland had an uneventful history. In order to appreciate the\r\nsignificance of Robert Owen’s work it is necessary to recall some of the\r\nmost important features of the social condition of the country in his\r\ntime. The English worker had no fixed interest in the soil. He had no\r\nvoice either in local or national government. He had little education or\r\nnone at all. His dwelling was wretched in the extreme. The right even of\r\ncombination was denied him till 1824. The wages of the agricultural\r\nlabourer were miserably low.\r\n\r\nThe workman’s share in the benefits of the industrial revolution was\r\ndoubtful. Great numbers of his class were reduced to utter poverty and\r\nruin by the great changes consequent on the introduction of machinery;\r\nthe tendency to readjustment was slow and continually disturbed by fresh\r\nchange. The hours of work were mercilessly long. He had to compete\r\nagainst the labour of women, and of children brought frequently at the\r\nage of five or six from the workhouses. These children had to work the\r\nsame long hours as the adults, and they were sometimes very cruelly\r\ntreated by the overseers. Destitute as they so often were of parental\r\nprotection and oversight, with both sexes huddled together under immoral\r\nand insanitary conditions, it was only natural that they should fall\r\ninto the worst habits, and that their offspring should to such a\r\nlamentable degree be vicious, improvident, and physically degenerate.\r\n\r\nIn a country where the labourers had neither education nor political or\r\nsocial rights, and where the peasantry were practically landless serfs,\r\nthe old English poor law was only a doubtful part of an evil system. All\r\nthese permanent causes of mischief were aggravated by special causes\r\nconnected with the cessation of the Napoleonic wars, which are well\r\nknown. It was in such circumstances, when English pauperism had become a\r\ngrave national question, that Owen first brought forward his scheme of\r\nsocialism.\r\n\r\nRobert Owen, philanthropist, and founder of English socialism, was born\r\nat the village of Newtown, Montgomeryshire, North Wales, in 1771.[1] His\r\nfather had a small business in Newtown as saddler and ironmonger, and\r\nthere young Owen received all his school education, which terminated at\r\nthe age of nine. At ten he went to Stamford, where he served in a\r\ndraper’s shop for three or four years, and, after a short experience of\r\nwork in a London shop, removed to Manchester.\r\n\r\nHis success at Manchester was very rapid. When only nineteen years of\r\nage he became manager of a cotton-mill, in which five hundred people\r\nwere employed, and by his administrative intelligence, energy, industry,\r\nand steadiness, soon made it one of the best establishments of the kind\r\nin Great Britain. In this factory Owen used the first bags of American\r\nSea-Island cotton ever imported into the country; it was the first\r\ncotton obtained from the Southern States of America. Owen also made\r\nremarkable improvement in the quality of the cotton spun. Indeed there\r\nis no reason to doubt that at this early age he was the first\r\ncotton-spinner in England, a position entirely due to his own capacity\r\nand knowledge of the trade, as he had found the mill in no well-ordered\r\ncondition and was left to organise it entirely on his own\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nOwen had become manager and one of the partners of the Chorlton Twist\r\nCompany at Manchester, when he made his first acquaintance with the\r\nscene of his future philanthropic efforts at New Lanark. During a visit\r\nto Glasgow he had fallen in love with the daughter of the proprietor of\r\nthe New Lanark mills, Mr. Dale. Owen induced his partners to purchase\r\nNew Lanark; and after his marriage with Miss Dale he settled there, in\r\n1800, as manager and part owner of the mills. Encouraged by his great\r\nsuccess in the management of cotton-factories in Manchester, he had\r\nalready formed the intention of conducting New Lanark on higher\r\nprinciples than the current commercial ones.\r\n\r\nThe factory of New Lanark had been started in 1784 by Dale and\r\nArkwright, the water-power afforded by the falls of the Clyde being the\r\ngreat attraction. Connected with the mills were about two thousand\r\npeople, five hundred of whom were children, brought, most of them, at\r\nthe age of five or six from the poorhouses and charities of Edinburgh\r\nand Glasgow. The children especially had been well treated by Dale, but\r\nthe general condition of the people was very unsatisfactory. Many of\r\nthem were the lowest of the population, the respectable country-people\r\nrefusing to submit to the long hours and demoralising drudgery of the\r\nfactories. Theft, drunkenness, and other vices were common; education\r\nand sanitation were alike neglected; most families lived only in one\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nIt was this population, thus committed to his care, which Owen now set\r\nhimself to elevate and ameliorate. He greatly improved their houses, and\r\nby the unsparing and benevolent exertion of his personal influence\r\ntrained them to habits of order, cleanliness, and thrift. He opened a\r\nstore, where the people could buy goods of the soundest quality at\r\nlittle more than cost price; and the sale of drink was placed under the\r\nstrictest supervision. His greatest success, however, was in the\r\neducation of the young, to which he devoted special attention. He was\r\nthe founder of infant schools in Great Britain; and, though he was\r\nanticipated by Continental reformers, he seems to have been led to\r\ninstitute them by his own views of what education ought to be, and\r\nwithout hint from abroad.\r\n\r\nIn all these plans Owen obtained the most gratifying success. Though at\r\nfirst regarded with suspicion as a stranger, he soon won the confidence\r\nof his people. The mills continued to prosper commercially, but it is\r\nneedless to say that some of Owen’s schemes involved considerable\r\nexpense, which was displeasing to his partners. Wearied at last of the\r\nrestrictions imposed on him by men who wished to conduct the business on\r\nthe ordinary principles, Owen, in 1813, formed a new firm, whose\r\nmembers, content with 5 per cent of return for their capital, would be\r\nready to give freer scope to his philanthropy. In this firm Jeremy\r\nBentham and the well-known Quaker, William Allen, were partners.\r\n\r\nIn the same year Owen first appeared as an author of essays, in which he\r\nexpounded the principles on which his system of educational philanthropy\r\nwas based. From an early age he had lost all belief in the prevailing\r\nforms of religion, and had thought out a creed for himself, which he\r\nconsidered an entirely new and original discovery. The chief points in\r\nthis philosophy were that man’s character is made not by him but for\r\nhim; that it has been formed by circumstances over which he had no\r\ncontrol; that he is not a proper subject either of praise or\r\nblame—these principles leading up to the practical conclusion that the\r\ngreat secret in the right formation of man’s character is to place him\r\nunder the proper influences, physical, moral, and social, from his\r\nearliest years. These principles, of the irresponsibility of man and of\r\nthe effect of early influences, are the keynote of Owen’s whole system\r\nof education and social amelioration. As we have said, they are embodied\r\nin his first work, _A New View of Society; or, Essays on the Principle\r\nof the Formation of the Human Character_, the first of these essays\r\n(there are four in all) being published in 1813. It is needless to say\r\nthat Owen’s new views theoretically belong to a very old system of\r\nphilosophy, and that his originality is to be found only in his\r\nbenevolent application of them.\r\n\r\nFor the next few years Owen’s work at New Lanark continued to have a\r\nnational and even a European significance. His schemes for the education\r\nof his workpeople attained to something like completion on the opening\r\nof the institution at New Lanark in 1816. He was a zealous supporter of\r\nthe factory legislation resulting in the Act of 1819, which, however,\r\ngreatly disappointed him. He had interviews and communications with the\r\nleading members of Government, including the Premier, Lord Liverpool,\r\nand with many of the rulers and leading statesmen of the Continent. New\r\nLanark itself became a much-frequented place of pilgrimage for social\r\nreformers, statesmen, and royal personages, amongst whom was Nicholas,\r\nafterwards Emperor of Russia. According to the unanimous testimony of\r\nall who visited it, the results achieved by Owen were singularly good.\r\nThe manners of the children, brought up under his system, were\r\nbeautifully graceful, genial, and unconstrained; health, plenty, and\r\ncontentment prevailed; drunkenness was almost unknown, and illegitimacy\r\nwas extremely rare. The most perfect good-feeling subsisted between Owen\r\nand his workpeople; all the operations of the mill proceeded with the\r\nutmost smoothness and regularity; and the business still enjoyed great\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nHitherto Owen’s work had been that of a philanthropist, whose great\r\ndistinction was the originality and unwearying unselfishness of his\r\nmethods. His first departure in socialism took place in 1817, and was\r\nembodied in a report communicated to the Committee of the House of\r\nCommons on the Poor Law. The general misery and stagnation of trade\r\nconsequent on the termination of the great war were engrossing the\r\nattention of the country. After clearly tracing the special causes\r\nconnected with the war which had led to such a deplorable state of\r\nthings, Owen pointed out that the permanent cause of distress was to be\r\nfound in the competition of human labour with machinery, and that the\r\nonly effective remedy was the united action of men, and the\r\nsubordination of machinery. His proposals for the treatment of pauperism\r\nwere based on these principles.\r\n\r\nHe recommended that communities of about twelve hundred persons should\r\nbe settled on spaces of land of from 1000 to 1500 acres, all living in\r\none large building in the form of a square, with public kitchen and\r\nmess-rooms. Each family should have its own private apartments, and the\r\nentire care of the children till the age of three, after which they\r\nshould be brought up by the community, their parents having access to\r\nthem at meals and all other proper times. These communities might be\r\nestablished by individuals, by parishes, by counties, or by the State;\r\nin every case there should be effective supervision by duly qualified\r\npersons. Work, and the enjoyment of its results, should be in common.\r\n\r\nThe size of his community was no doubt partly suggested by his village\r\nof New Lanark; and he soon proceeded to advocate such a scheme as the\r\nbest form for the reorganisation of society in general. In its fully\r\ndeveloped form—and it cannot be said to have changed much during Owen’s\r\nlifetime—it was as follows. He considered an association of from 500 to\r\n3000 as the fit number for a good working community. While mainly\r\nagricultural, it should possess all the best machinery, should offer\r\nevery variety of employment, and should, as far as possible, be\r\nself-contained. In other words, his communities were intended to be\r\nself-dependent units, which should provide the best education and the\r\nconstant exercise of unselfish intelligence, should unite the advantages\r\nof town and country life, and should correct the monotonous activity of\r\nthe factory with the freest variety of occupation, while utilising all\r\nthe latest improvements in industrial technique. ‘As these townships,’\r\nas he also called them, ‘should increase in number, unions of them\r\nfederatively united shall be formed in circles of tens, hundreds, and\r\nthousands,’ till they should embrace the whole world in one great\r\nrepublic with a common interest.\r\n\r\nHis plans for the cure of pauperism were received with great favour. The\r\n_Times_ and the _Morning Post_, and many of the leading men of the\r\ncountry, countenanced them; one of his most steadfast friends was the\r\nDuke of Kent, father of Queen Victoria. He had indeed gained the ear of\r\nthe country, and had the prospect before him of a great career as a\r\nsocial reformer, when he went out of his way at a large meeting in\r\nLondon to declare his hostility to all the received forms of religion.\r\nAfter this defiance to the religious sentiment of the country, Owen’s\r\ntheories were in the popular mind associated with infidelity, and were\r\nhenceforward suspected and discredited.\r\n\r\nOwen’s own confidence, however, remained unshaken, and he was anxious\r\nthat his scheme for establishing a community should be tested. At last,\r\nin 1825, such an experiment was attempted under the direction of his\r\ndisciple, Abram Combe, at Orbiston, near Glasgow; and in the same year\r\nOwen himself commenced another at New Harmony, in Indiana, America.\r\nAfter a trial of about two years both failed completely. Neither of them\r\nwas a pauper experiment; but it must be said that the members were of\r\nthe most motley description, many worthy people of the highest aims\r\nbeing mixed with vagrants, adventurers, and crotchety wrong-headed\r\nenthusiasts.\r\n\r\nAfter a long period of friction with William Allen and some of his other\r\npartners, Owen resigned all connection with New Lanark in 1828. On his\r\nreturn from America he made London the centre of his activity. Most of\r\nhis means having been sunk in the New Harmony experiment, he was no\r\nlonger a flourishing capitalist, but the head of a vigorous propaganda,\r\nin which socialism and secularism were combined. One of the most\r\ninteresting features of the movement at this period was the\r\nestablishment in 1832 of an equitable labour exchange system, in which\r\nexchange was effected by means of labour notes, the usual means of\r\nexchange and the usual middlemen being alike superseded. The word\r\n‘socialism’ first became current in the discussions of the Association\r\nof all Classes of all Nations, formed by Owen in 1835.\r\n\r\nDuring these years also his secularistic teaching gained such influence\r\namong the working classes as to give occasion, in 1839, for the\r\nstatement in the _Westminster Review_ that his principles were the\r\nactual creed of a great portion of them. His views on marriage, which\r\nwere certainly lax, gave just ground for offence. At this period some\r\nmore communistic experiments were made, of which the most important were\r\nthat at Ralahine, in the county of Clare, Ireland, and that at Tytherly,\r\nin Hampshire. It is admitted that the former, which was established in\r\n1839, was a remarkable success for three and a half years, till the\r\nproprietor, who had granted the use of the land, having ruined himself\r\nby gambling, was obliged to sell out. Tytherly, begun in 1839, was an\r\nabsolute failure. By 1846 the only permanent result of Owen’s agitation,\r\nso zealously carried on by public meetings, pamphlets, periodicals, and\r\noccasional treatises, was the co-operative movement, and for the time\r\neven that seemed to have utterly collapsed. In his later years Owen\r\nbecame a firm believer in spiritualism. He died in 1858 at his native\r\ntown at the age of eighty-seven.\r\n\r\nThe causes of Owen’s failure in establishing his communities are obvious\r\nenough. Apart from the difficulties inherent in socialism, he injured\r\nthe social cause by going out of his way to attack the historic\r\nreligions and the accepted views on marriage, by his tediousness,\r\nquixotry, and over-confidence, by refusing to see that for the mass of\r\nmen measures of transition from an old to a new system must be adopted.\r\nIf he had been truer to his earlier methods and retained the autocratic\r\nguidance of his experiments, the chances of success would have been\r\ngreater. Above all, Owen had too great faith in human nature, and he did\r\nnot understand the laws of social evolution. His great doctrine of the\r\ninfluence of circumstances in the formation of character was only a very\r\ncrude way of expressing the law of social continuity so much emphasised\r\nby recent socialism. He thought that he could break the chain of\r\ncontinuity, and as by magic create a new set of circumstances, which\r\nwould forthwith produce a new generation of rational and unselfish men.\r\nThe time was too strong for him, and the current of English history\r\nswept past him.\r\n\r\nEven a very brief account of Owen, however, would be incomplete without\r\nindicating his relation to Malthus. Against Malthus he showed that the\r\nwealth of the country had, in consequence of mechanical improvement,\r\nincreased out of all proportion to the population. The problem,\r\ntherefore, was not to restrict population, but to institute rational\r\nsocial arrangements and to secure a fair distribution of wealth.\r\nWhenever the number of inhabitants in any of his communities increased\r\nbeyond the maximum, new ones should be created, until they should extend\r\nover the whole world. There would be no fear of over-population for a\r\nlong time to come. Its evils were then felt in Ireland and other\r\ncountries; but that condition of things was owing to the total want of\r\nthe most ordinary common sense on the part of the blinded authorities of\r\nthe world. The period would probably never arrive when the earth would\r\nbe full; but, if it should, the human race would be good, intelligent,\r\nand rational, and would know much better than the present irrational\r\ngeneration how to provide for the occurrence. Such was Owen’s\r\nsocialistic treatment of the population problem.\r\n\r\nRobert Owen was essentially a pioneer, whose work and influence it would\r\nbe unjust to measure by their tangible results. Apart from his\r\nsocialistic theories, it should, nevertheless, be remembered that he was\r\none of the foremost and most energetic promoters of many movements of\r\nacknowledged and enduring usefulness. He was the founder of infant\r\nschools in England; he was the first to introduce reasonably short hours\r\ninto factory labour, and zealously promoted factory legislation—one of\r\nthe most needed and most beneficial reforms of the century; and he was\r\nthe real founder of the co-operative movement. In general education, in\r\nsanitary reform, and in his sound and humanitarian views of common life,\r\nhe was far in advance of his time. Like Fourier, also, he did the great\r\nservice of calling attention to the advantages which might be obtained\r\nin the social development of the future from the reorganisation of the\r\ncommune, or self-governing local group of workers.\r\n\r\nStill, he had many serious faults; all that was quixotic, crude, and\r\nsuperficial in his views became more prominent in his later years, and\r\nby the extravagance of his advocacy of them he did vital injury to the\r\ncause he had at heart. In his personal character he was without\r\nreproach—frank, benevolent, and straightforward to a fault; and he\r\npursued the altruistic schemes in which he spent all his means with more\r\nearnestness than most men devote to the accumulation of a fortune.\r\n\r\nIn England the reform of 1832 had the same effect as the revolution of\r\nJuly (1830) in France: it brought the middle class into power, and by\r\nthe exclusion of the workmen emphasised their existence as a separate\r\nclass. The discontent of the workmen now found expression in Chartism.\r\nAs is obvious from the contents of the Charter, Chartism was most\r\nprominently a demand for political reform; but both in its origin and in\r\nits ultimate aim the movement was more essentially economic. As regards\r\nthe study of socialism, the interest of this movement lies greatly in\r\nthe fact that in its organs the doctrine of ‘surplus value,’ afterwards\r\nelaborated by Marx as the basis of his system, is broadly and\r\nemphatically enunciated. While the worker produces all the wealth, he is\r\nobliged to content himself with the meagre share necessary to support\r\nhis existence, and the surplus goes to the capitalist, who, with the\r\nking, the priests, lords, esquires, and gentlemen, lives upon the labour\r\nof the working man (_Poor Man’s Guardian_, 1835).\r\n\r\nAfter the downfall of Owenism began the Christian socialist movement in\r\nEngland (1848-52), of which the leaders were Maurice, Kingsley, and Mr.\r\nLudlow. The abortive Chartist demonstration of April 1848 excited in\r\nMaurice and his friends the deepest sympathy with the sufferings of the\r\nEnglish working class—a feeling which was intensified by the\r\nrevelations regarding ‘London Labour and the London Poor’ published in\r\nthe _Morning Chronicle_ in 1849. Mr. Ludlow, who had in France become\r\nacquainted with the theories of Fourier, was the economist of the\r\nmovement, and it was with him that the idea originated of starting\r\nco-operative associations.\r\n\r\nIn _Politics for the People_, in the _Christian Socialist_, in the\r\npulpit and on the platform, and in _Yeast_ and _Alton Locke_, well-known\r\nnovels of Kingsley, the representatives of the movement exposed the\r\nevils of the competitive system, carried on an unsparing warfare against\r\nthe Manchester School, and maintained that socialism, rightly\r\nunderstood, was only Christianity applied to social reform. Their\r\nlabours in insisting on ethical and spiritual principles as the true\r\nbonds of society, in promoting associations, and in diffusing a\r\nknowledge of co-operation, were largely beneficial. In the north of\r\nEngland they joined hands with the co-operative movement inaugurated by\r\nthe Rochdale pioneers in 1844 under the influence of Owenism. Productive\r\nco-operation made very little progress, but co-operative distribution\r\nsoon proved a great success.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[1] Of R. Owen’s numerous works in exposition of his system, the most\r\nimportant are the _New View of Society_; the _Report_ communicated to\r\nthe Committee on the Poor Law; the _Book of the New Moral World_; and\r\n_Revolution in the Mind and Practice of the Human Race_.

Life\r\n\r\nIn 1852 the twofold socialist movement in France and England had come to\r\nan end, leaving no visible result of any importance. From that date the\r\nmost prominent leaders of socialism have been German and Russian.\r\n\r\nGerman socialists also played a part in the revolution of 1848 and in\r\nthe years that preceded it; but as the work that makes their names\r\nreally historical was not performed till a later period, we have\r\npostponed the consideration of it till now, when we can treat it as a\r\nwhole. The most conspicuous chiefs of German socialism have been Karl\r\nMarx, Friedrich Engels, Lassalle, and Rodbertus. Of these, Lassalle[1]\r\nwas the first to make his mark in history as the originator of the\r\nSocial Democratic movement in Germany.\r\n\r\nFerdinand Lassalle was born at Breslau in 1825.\r\n\r\nLike Karl Marx, the chief of international socialism, he was of Jewish\r\nextraction. His father, a prosperous merchant in Breslau, intended\r\nFerdinand for a business career, and with this view sent him to the\r\ncommercial school at Leipsic; but the boy, having no liking for that\r\nkind of life, got himself transferred to the university, first at\r\nBreslau, and afterwards at Berlin. His favourite studies were philology\r\nand philosophy; he became an ardent Hegelian, and in politics was one of\r\nthe most advanced. Having completed his university studies in 1845, he\r\nbegan to write a work on _Heracleitus_ from the Hegelian point of view;\r\nbut it was soon interrupted by more stirring interests, and did not see\r\nthe light for many years.\r\n\r\nFrom the Rhine country, where he settled for a time, he went to Paris,\r\nand made the acquaintance of his great compatriot Heine, who conceived\r\nfor him the deepest sympathy and admiration. In the letter of\r\nintroduction to Varnhagen von Ense, which the poet gave Lassalle when he\r\nreturned to Berlin, there is a striking portrait of the future agitator.\r\nHeine speaks of his friend Lassalle as a young man of the most\r\nremarkable endowments, in whom the widest knowledge, the greatest\r\nacuteness, and the richest gifts of expression are combined with an\r\nenergy and practical ability which excite his astonishment; but adds, in\r\nhis half-mocking way, that he is a genuine son of the new era, without\r\neven the pretence of modesty or self-denial, who will assert and enjoy\r\nhimself in the world of realities. At Berlin, Lassalle became a\r\nfavourite in some of the most distinguished circles; even the veteran\r\nHumboldt was fascinated by him, and used to call him the _Wunderkind_.\r\n\r\nHere it was also, early in 1846, that he met the lady with whom his life\r\nwas to be associated in so striking a way, the Countess Hatzfeldt. She\r\nhad been separated from her husband for many years, and was at feud with\r\nhim on questions of property and the custody of their children. With\r\ncharacteristic energy Lassalle adopted the cause of the countess, whom\r\nhe believed to have been outrageously wronged, made a special study of\r\nlaw, and, after bringing the case before thirty-six tribunals, reduced\r\nthe powerful count to a compromise on terms most favourable to his\r\nclient.\r\n\r\nThe process, which lasted eight years, gave rise to not a little\r\nscandal, especially that of the _Cassettengeschichte_. This ‘affair of\r\nthe casket’ arose out of an attempt by the countess’s friends to get\r\npossession of a bond for a large life-annuity settled by the count on\r\nhis mistress, a Baroness Meyendorf, to the prejudice of the countess and\r\nher children. At the instigation of Lassalle, two of his comrades\r\nsucceeded in carrying off a casket, which was supposed to contain the\r\ndocument in question (but which really contained her jewels), from the\r\nbaroness’s room at a hotel in Cologne. They were prosecuted for theft,\r\none of them being condemned to six months’ imprisonment. Lassalle\r\nhimself was accused of moral complicity, but was acquitted on appeal.\r\n\r\nHis intimate relations with the countess, which continued till the end,\r\ncertainly did not tend to improve Lassalle’s position in German society.\r\nRightly or wrongly, people had an unfavourable impression of him, as of\r\nan adventurer. Here we can but say that he claimed to act from the\r\nnoblest motives; in the individual lot and suffering of the countess he\r\nsaw the social misery of the time reflected, and his assertion of her\r\ncause was a moral insurrection against it. While the case was pending,\r\nhe gave the countess a share of his allowance from his father; and after\r\nit was won, he received according to agreement, from the now ample\r\nresources of the lady, an annual income of four thousand thalers (£600).\r\nAdded to his own private means, this sum placed the finances of Lassalle\r\non a sure footing for the rest of his life. His conduct was a mixture of\r\nchivalry and business, which every one must judge for himself. It was\r\ncertainly not in accordance with the conventionalities, but for these\r\nLassalle never entertained much respect.\r\n\r\nIn 1848 Lassalle attached himself to the group of men, Karl Marx,\r\nEngels, Freiligrath, and others, who in the Rhine country represented\r\nthe socialistic and extreme democratic side of the revolution, and whose\r\norgan was the _New Rhenish Gazette_. But the activity of Lassalle was\r\nonly local and subordinate. He was, however, condemned to six months’\r\nimprisonment for resisting the authorities at Dusseldorf. On that\r\noccasion Lassalle prepared the first of those speeches which made so\r\ngreat an impression on the men of his time; but it was not delivered. It\r\ncontains the first important statement of his social and political\r\nopinions. ‘I will always joyfully confess,’ he said, ‘that from inner\r\nconviction I am a decided adherent of the Social Democratic republic.’\r\n\r\nTill 1858 Lassalle resided mostly in the Rhine country, prosecuting the\r\nsuit of his friend the countess, and afterwards completing his work on\r\nHeracleitus, which was published in that year. He was not allowed to\r\nlive in Berlin because of his connection with the disturbances of 1848.\r\nIn 1859 he returned to the capital disguised as a carter, and finally,\r\nthrough the influence of Humboldt with the king, received permission to\r\nremain.\r\n\r\nIn the same year he published a remarkable pamphlet on _The Italian War\r\nand the Mission of Prussia_, in which he came forward to warn his\r\ncountrymen against going to the rescue of Austria in her war with\r\nFrance. He argued that if France drove Austria out of Italy she might\r\nannex Savoy, but could not prevent the restoration of Italian unity\r\nunder Victor Emmanuel. France was doing the work of Germany by weakening\r\nAustria, the great cause of German disunion and weakness; Prussia should\r\nform an alliance with France in order to drive out Austria and make\r\nherself supreme in Germany. After their realisation by Bismarck, these\r\nideas have become sufficiently commonplace; but they were nowise obvious\r\nwhen thus published by Lassalle. In this, as in other matters, he showed\r\nthat he possessed both the insight and foresight of a statesman.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the Hatzfeldt suit Lassalle had acquired no little\r\nknowledge of law, which proved serviceable to him in the great work,\r\n_System of Acquired Rights_, published in 1861. The book professes to\r\nbe, and in a great measure is, an application of the historical method\r\nto legal ideas and institutions; but it is largely dominated also by\r\nabstract conceptions, which are not really drawn from history, but read\r\ninto it. The results of his investigation are sufficiently\r\nrevolutionary; in the legal sphere they go even farther than his\r\nsocialistic writings in the economic and political. But with one\r\nimportant exception he made no attempt to base his socialistic agitation\r\non his _System of Acquired Rights_; it simply remained a learned work.\r\n\r\nHitherto Lassalle had been known only as the author of two learned\r\nworks, and as connected with one of the most extraordinary lawsuits of\r\nthe nineteenth century, which had become a widespread scandal. Now began\r\nthe brief activity which was to give him an historical significance. His\r\nrevolutionary activity in 1848, though only a short phase in his career,\r\nwas not an accident; it represented a permanent feature of his\r\ncharacter. In him the student and the man of action were combined in a\r\nnotable manner, but the craving for effective action was eminently\r\nstrong. The revolutionary and the active elements in his strangely mixed\r\nnature had for want of an opportunity been for many years in abeyance.\r\n\r\nA rare opportunity had at last come for asserting his old convictions.\r\nIn the struggle between the Prussian Government and the Opposition he\r\nsaw an opportunity for vindicating a great cause, that of the working\r\nmen, which would outflank the Liberalism of the middle classes, and\r\nmight command the sympathy and respect of the Government. But his\r\npolitical programme was entirely subordinate to the social, that of\r\nbettering the condition of the working classes; and he believed that as\r\ntheir champion he might have such influence in the Prussian State as to\r\ndetermine it on entering on a great career of social amelioration.\r\n\r\nThe social activity of Lassalle dates from the year 1862. It was a time\r\nof new life in Germany. The forces destined to transform the Germany of\r\nHegel into the Germany of Bismarck were preparing. The time for the\r\nrestoration and unification of the Fatherland under the leadership of\r\nPrussia had come. The nation that had so long been foremost in\r\nphilosophy and theory was to take a leading place in the practical walks\r\nof national life, in war and politics, and in the modern methods of\r\nindustry. The man who died as first German Emperor of the new order\r\nascended the throne of Prussia in 1861. Bismarck, whose mission it was\r\nto take the chief part in this great transformation, entered on the\r\nscene as Chief Minister of Prussia in the autumn of 1862. The\r\nProgressist party, that phase of German Liberalism which was to offer\r\nsuch bitter opposition both to Bismarck and Lassalle, came into\r\nexistence in 1861.\r\n\r\nFor accomplishing this world-historic change the decisive factor was the\r\nPrussian army. The new rulers of Prussia clearly saw that for the\r\nsuccess of their plans everything would depend on the efficiency of the\r\narmy. But on the question of its reorganisation they came into conflict\r\nwith the Liberals, who, failing to comprehend the policy of Bismarck,\r\nrefused him the supplies necessary for realising ideals dear to every\r\nGerman patriot.\r\n\r\nIn the controversy so bitterly waged between the Prussian monarchy and\r\nthe Liberals, Lassalle intervened. As might be expected, he was not a\r\nman to be bound by the formulas of Prussian Liberalism, and in a\r\nlecture, _On the Nature of a Constitution_, delivered early in 1862, he\r\nexpounded views entirely at variance with them. In this lecture his aim\r\nwas to show that a constitution is not a theory or a document written on\r\npaper; it is the expression of the strongest political forces of the\r\ntime. The king, the nobility, the middle class, the working class, all\r\nthese are forces in the polity of Prussia; but the strongest of all is\r\nthe king, who possesses in the army a means of political power, which is\r\norganised, excellently disciplined, always at hand, and always ready to\r\nmarch. The army is the basis of the actual working constitution of\r\nPrussia. In the struggle against a Government resting on such a basis,\r\nverbal protests and compromises were of no avail.\r\n\r\nIn a second lecture, _What Next?_, Lassalle proceeded to maintain that\r\nthere was only one method for effectually resisting the Government, to\r\nproclaim the facts of the political situation as they were, and then to\r\nretire from the Chamber. By remaining they only gave a false appearance\r\nof legality to the doings of the Government. If they withdrew it must\r\nyield, as in the present state of political opinion in Prussia and in\r\ncivilised Europe no Government could exist in defiance of the wishes of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nIn a pamphlet subsequently published under the title of _Might and\r\nRight_, Lassalle defended himself against the accusation that in these\r\nlectures he had subordinated the claims of Right to those of Force. He\r\nhad, he said, not been expressing his own views of what ought to be; he\r\nhad simply been elucidating facts in an historical way, he had only been\r\nexplaining the real nature of the situation. He now went on to declare\r\nthat no one in the Prussian State had any right to speak of Right but\r\nthe old and genuine democracy. It had always cleaved to the Right,\r\ndegrading itself by no compromise with power. With the democracy alone\r\nis Right, and with it alone will be Might.\r\n\r\nWe need not say that these utterances of Lassalle had no influence on\r\nthe march of events. The rulers pushed on the reorganising of the army\r\nwith supplies obtained without the consent of the Prussian Chambers, the\r\nLiberal members protesting in vain till the great victory over Austria\r\nin 1866 furnished an ample justification for the policy of Bismarck.\r\n\r\nBut their publication marked an important crisis in his own career, for\r\nthey did not recommend him to the favourable consideration of the German\r\nLiberals with whom he had previously endeavoured to act. He and they\r\nnever had much sympathy for one another. They were fettered by formulas\r\nas well as wanting in energy and initiative. On the other hand, his\r\nadventurous career; his temperament, which disposed him to rebel against\r\nthe conventionalities and formulas generally; his loyalty to the extreme\r\ndemocracy of 1848, all brought him into disharmony with the current\r\nLiberalism of his time. They gave him no tokens of their confidence, and\r\nhe chose a path of his own.\r\n\r\nA more decisive step in a new direction was taken in 1862 by his\r\nlecture, _The Working-Men’s Programme; On the special Connection of the\r\nPresent Epoch of History with the Idea of the Working Class_. The gist\r\nof this lecture was to show that we are now entering on a new era of\r\nhistory, of which the working class are the makers and representatives.\r\nIt is a masterly performance, lucid in style, and scientific in method\r\nof treatment. Yet this did not save its author from the attentions of\r\nthe Prussian police. Lassalle was brought to trial on the charge of\r\nexciting the poor against the rich, and in spite of an able defence,\r\npublished under the title of _Science and the Workers_, he was condemned\r\nto four months’ imprisonment. But he appealed, and on the second hearing\r\nof the case made such an impression on the judges that the sentence was\r\ncommuted into a fine of £15.\r\n\r\nSuch proceedings naturally brought Lassalle into prominence as the\r\nexponent of a new way of thinking on social and political subjects. A\r\nsection of the working men were, like himself, discontented with the\r\ncurrent German Liberalism. The old democracy of 1848 was beginning to\r\nawake from the apathy and lassitude consequent on the failures of that\r\ntroubled period. Men imbued with the traditions and aspirations of such\r\na time could not be satisfied with the half-hearted programme of the\r\nProgressists, who would not decide on adopting universal suffrage as\r\npart of their policy, yet wished to utilise the workmen for their own\r\nends. A Liberalism which had not the courage to be frankly democratic,\r\ncould only be a temporary and unsatisfactory phase of political\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThis discontent found expression at Leipsic, where a body of workmen,\r\ndispleased with the Progressists, yet undecided as to any clear line of\r\npolicy, had formed a Central Committee for the calling together of a\r\nWorking Men’s Congress. With Lassalle, they had common ground in their\r\ndiscontent with the Progressists, and to him in 1863 they applied, in\r\nthe hope that he might suggest a definite line of action. Lassalle\r\nreplied in an _Open Letter_, with a political and social-economic\r\nprogramme, which, for lucidity and comprehensiveness of statement, left\r\nnothing to be desired. In the _Working Men’s Programme_, Lassalle had\r\ndrawn the rough outlines of a new historic period, in which the\r\ninterests of labour should be paramount; in the _Open Letter_ he\r\nexpounds the political, social, and economic principles which should\r\nguide the working men in inaugurating the new era. The _Open Letter_ has\r\nwell been called the Charter of German Socialism. It was the first\r\nhistoric act in a new stage of social development. We need not say that\r\nit marked the definite rupture of Lassalle with German Liberalism.\r\n\r\nIn the _Open Letter_ the guiding principles of the Social Democratic\r\nagitation of Lassalle are given with absolute clearness and decision:\r\nthat the working men should form an independent political party—one,\r\nhowever, in which the political programme should be entirely\r\nsubordinated to the great social end of improving the condition of their\r\nclass; that the schemes of Schulze-Delitzsch[2] for this end were\r\ninadequate; that the operation of the iron law of wages prevented any\r\nreal improvement under the existing conditions; that productive\r\nassociations, by which, the workmen should secure the full product of\r\ntheir labour, should be established by the State, founded on universal\r\nsuffrage, and therefore truly representative of the people. The Leipsic\r\nCommittee accepted the policy thus sketched, and invited him to address\r\nthem in person. After hearing him the meeting voted in his favour by a\r\nmajority of 1300 against 7.\r\n\r\nA subsequent appearance at Frankfort-on-the-Main was even more\r\nflattering to Lassalle. In that as in most other towns of Germany the\r\nworkmen were generally disposed to support Schulze and the Progressist\r\nparty. Lassalle therefore had the hard task of conciliating and gaining\r\na hearing from a hostile audience. His first speech, four hours in\r\nlength, met at times with a stormy reception, and was frequently\r\ninterrupted. Yet he gained the sympathy of his audience by his eloquence\r\nand the intrinsic interest of his matter, and the applause increased as\r\nhe went on. When, two days afterwards, he addressed them a second time,\r\nthe assembly voted for Lassalle by 400 to 40. It was really a great\r\ntriumph. Like Napoleon, he had, he said, beaten the enemy with their own\r\ntroops. On the following day he addressed a meeting at Mainz, where 700\r\nworkmen unanimously declared in his favour.\r\n\r\nThese successes seemed to justify Lassalle in taking the decisive step\r\nof his agitation—the foundation of the Universal German Working Men’s\r\nAssociation, which followed at Leipsic on May 23, 1863. Its programme\r\nwas a simple one, containing only one point—universal suffrage.\r\n‘Proceeding from the conviction that only through equal and direct\r\nuniversal suffrage[3] can a sufficient representation of the social\r\ninterests of the German working class and a real removal of class\r\nantagonisms in society be realised, the Association pursues the aim, in\r\na peaceful and legal way, especially by winning over public opinion, to\r\nwork for the establishment of equal and direct universal suffrage.’\r\n\r\nHitherto Lassalle had been an isolated individual expressing on his own\r\nresponsibility an opinion on the topics of the day. He was elected\r\nPresident, for five years, of the newly founded Association, and was\r\ntherefore the head of a new movement. He had crossed the Rubicon, not\r\nwithout hesitation and misgiving.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1863 little was accomplished. The membership of the\r\nAssociation grew but slowly, and, according to his wont, Lassalle\r\nretired to the baths to recruit his health. In the autumn he renewed his\r\nagitation by a ‘review’ of his forces on the Rhine, where the workmen\r\nwere most enthusiastic in his favour. But the severest crisis of his\r\nagitation befell during the winter of 1863-4. At this period his labours\r\nwere almost more than human; he wrote his _Bastiat-Schulze_,[4] a\r\nconsiderable treatise, in about three months, defended himself before\r\nthe courts both of Berlin and the Rhine in elaborate speeches, conducted\r\nthe affairs of his Association in all their troublesome details, and\r\noften before stormy and hostile audiences gave a succession of\r\naddresses, the aim of which was the conquest of Berlin.\r\n\r\nLassalle’s _Bastiat-Schulze_, his largest economic work, bears all the\r\nmarks of the haste and feverishness of the time that gave it birth. It\r\ncontains passages in the worst possible taste; the coarseness and\r\nscurrility of his treatment of Schulze are absolutely unjustifiable. The\r\nbook consists of barren and unprofitable controversy, interspersed with\r\nphilosophic statements of his economic position, and even they are often\r\ncrude, confused, and exaggerated. Controversy is usually the most\r\nunsatisfactory department of literature, and of the various forms of\r\ncontroversy that of Lassalle is the least to be desired, consisting as\r\nit so largely did of supercilious verbal and captious objection. The\r\nbook as a whole is far below the level of the _Working Men’s Programme_\r\nand the _Open Letter_.\r\n\r\nAfter all these labours little wonder that we find him writing, on the\r\n14th of February: ‘I am tired to death, and strong as my constitution\r\nis, it is shaking to the core. My excitement is so great that I can no\r\nlonger sleep at night; I toss about on my bed till five o’clock, and\r\nrise up with aching head, and entirely exhausted. I am overworked,\r\novertasked, and overtired in the frightfullest degree; the mad effort,\r\nbeside my other labours, to finish the _Bastiat-Schulze_ in three\r\nmonths, the profound and painful disappointment, the cankering inner\r\ndisgust, caused by the indifference and apathy of the working class\r\ntaken as a whole—all has been too much even for me.’\r\n\r\nClearly the great agitator needed rest, and he decided to seek it, as\r\nusual, at the baths. But before he retired, he desired once more to\r\nrefresh his weary soul in the sympathetic enthusiasm which he\r\nanticipated from his devoted adherents on the Rhine. Accordingly, on the\r\n8th May 1864, Lassalle departed for the ‘glorious review of his army’ in\r\nthe Rhine country. ‘He spoke,’ Mehring tells us, ‘on May 14th at\r\nSolingen, on the 15th at Barmen, on the 16th at Cologne, on the 18th at\r\nWermelskirchen.’ His journey was like a royal progress or a triumphal\r\nprocession, except that the joy of the people was perfectly spontaneous.\r\nThousands of workmen received him with acclamations; crowds pressed upon\r\nhim to shake hands with him, to exchange friendly greetings with him.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd May, the first anniversary festival of the Universal\r\nAssociation, held at Ronsdorf, the enthusiasm reached its climax. Old\r\nand young, men and women, went forth to meet him as he approached the\r\ntown; and he entered it through triumphal arches, under a deluge of\r\nflowers thrown from the hands of working girls, amidst jubilation\r\nindescribable. Writing to the Countess of Hatzfeldt about this time of\r\nthe impression made on his mind by his reception on the Rhine, Lassalle\r\nsays, ‘I had the feeling that such scenes must have been witnessed at\r\nthe founding of new religions.’\r\n\r\nThe speech of Lassalle at Ronsdorf corresponded in character with the\r\nenthusiasm and exaltation of such a time and such an audience. The King\r\nof Prussia had recently listened with favour to the grievances of a\r\ndeputation of Silesian weavers, and promised to help them out of his own\r\npurse. Von Ketteler, Bishop of Mainz, had published a short treatise, in\r\nwhich he expressed his agreement with Lassalle’s criticism of the\r\nexisting economic system. As his manner was, Lassalle did not\r\nunder-estimate the value of those expressions of opinion. ‘We have\r\ncompelled,’ he declared, ‘the workmen, the people, the bishops, the\r\nking, to bear testimony to the truth of our principles.’\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to ridicule the enthusiasm for Lassalle entertained by\r\nthose workmen on the Rhine, but it will be more profitable if we pause\r\nfor a moment to realise the world-historic pathos of the scene. For the\r\nfirst time for many centuries we see the working men of Germany aroused\r\nfrom their hereditary degradation, apathy, and hopelessness. Change\r\nafter change had passed in the higher sphere of politics. One conqueror\r\nafter another had traversed these Rhine countries, but, whoever lost or\r\nwon, it was the working man who had to pay with his sweat and toil and\r\nsorrow. He was the anvil on which the hammer of those iron times had\r\nfallen without mercy and without intermission. His doom it was to\r\ndrudge, to be fleeced, to be drilled and marched off to fight battles in\r\nwhich he had no interest. Brief and fitful gleams of a wild and\r\ndesperate hope had visited these poor people before, only to go out\r\nagain in utter darkness; but now in a sky which had so long been black\r\nand dull with monotonous misery, the rays were discernible of\r\napproaching dawn, a shining light which would grow into a more perfect\r\nday. For in the process of history the time had come when the suffering\r\nwhich had so long been dumb should find a voice that would be heard over\r\nthe world, should find an organisation that would compel the attention\r\nof rulers and all men.\r\n\r\nSuch a cause can be most effectually furthered by wise and sane\r\nleadership: yet it is also well when it is not too dependent on the\r\nguidance of those who seek to control it. The career of Lassalle always\r\nhad its unpleasant features. He liked the passing effect too well. He\r\nwas too fond of display and pleasure. In much that he did there is a\r\nnote of exaggeration, bordering on insincerity. As his agitation\r\nproceeded, this feature of his character becomes more marked. Some of\r\nhis addresses to the workmen remind us too forcibly of the bulletins of\r\nthe first Napoleon. He was not always careful to have the firm ground of\r\nfact and reality beneath his feet. Many of his critics speak of the\r\nfailure of his agitation; with no good reason, considering how short a\r\ntime it had continued, hardly more than a year. Lassalle himself was\r\ngreatly disappointed with the comparatively little success he had\r\nattained. He had not the patience to wait till the sure operation of\r\ntruth and fact and the justice of the cause he fought for should bring\r\nhim the reward it merited. On all these grounds we cannot consider the\r\nevent which so unworthily closed his life as an accident; it was the\r\nmelancholy outcome of the weaker elements in his strangely mixed\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nWhile posing as the spokesman of the poor, Lassalle was a man of\r\ndecidedly fashionable and luxurious habits. His suppers were well known\r\nas among the most exquisite in Berlin. It was the most piquant feature\r\nof his life that he, one of the gilded youth, a connoisseur in wines,\r\nand a learned man to boot, had become agitator and the champion of the\r\nworkers. In one of the literary and fashionable circles of Berlin he had\r\nmet a young lady, a Fräulein von Dönniges, for whom he at once felt a\r\npassion which was ardently reciprocated. He met her again on the Rigi,\r\nin the summer of 1864, when they resolved to marry. She was a young lady\r\nof twenty, decidedly unconventional and original in character. It would\r\nappear from her own confession that she had not always respected the\r\nsacred German morality.\r\n\r\nBut she had for father a Bavarian diplomatist then resident in Geneva,\r\nwho was angry beyond all bounds when he heard of the proposed match, and\r\nwould have absolutely nothing to do with Lassalle. The lady was\r\nimprisoned in her own room, and soon, apparently under the influence of\r\nvery questionable pressure, renounced Lassalle in favour of another\r\nadmirer, a Wallachian, Count von Racowitza. Lassalle, who had resorted\r\nto every available means to gain his end, was now mad with rage, and\r\nsent a challenge both to the lady’s father and her betrothed, which was\r\naccepted by the latter. At the Carouge, a suburb of Geneva, the meeting\r\ntook place on the morning of August 28, 1864. Lassalle was mortally\r\nwounded, and died on the 31st of the same month. In spite of such a\r\nfoolish ending, his funeral was that of a martyr, and by many of his\r\nadherents he has since been regarded with feelings almost of religious\r\ndevotion.\r\n\r\nHow the career of Lassalle might have shaped itself in the new Germany\r\nunder the system of universal suffrage which was adopted only three\r\nyears after his death, is an interesting subject of speculation. He\r\ncould not have remained inactive, and he certainly would not have been\r\nhindered by _doctrinaire_ scruples from playing an effective part, even\r\nthough it were by some kind of alliance with the Government. His\r\nambition and his energy were alike boundless. In the heyday of his\r\npassion for Fräulein von Dönniges his dream was to be installed as the\r\nPresident of the German Republic with her elevated by his side. As it\r\nwas, his position at his death was rapidly becoming difficult and even\r\nuntenable; he was involved in a net of prosecutions which were fast\r\nclosing round him. He would soon have had no alternative but exile or a\r\nprolonged imprisonment.\r\n\r\nLassalle was undoubtedly a man of the most extraordinary endowments. The\r\nreader of his works feels that he is in the presence of a mind of a very\r\nhigh order. Both in his works and in his life we find an exceptional\r\ncombination of gifts, philosophic power, eloquence, enthusiasm,\r\npractical energy, a dominating force of will. Born of a cosmopolitan\r\nrace, which has produced so many men little trammelled by the\r\nconventionalism of the old European societies, he was to a remarkable\r\ndegree original and free from social prejudice; was one of the men in\r\nwhom the spirit of daring initiative is to a remarkable degree active.\r\nHe had in fact a revolutionary temperament, disciplined by the study of\r\nGerman philosophy, by the sense of the greatness of Prussia’s historic\r\nmission, and by a considerable measure of practical insight, for in this\r\nhe was not by any means wanting. In Marx we see the same temperament,\r\nonly in his case it was stronger, more solid, sell-restrained, matured\r\nby wider reflection, and especially by the study of the economic\r\ndevelopment of Europe, continued for a period of forty years.\r\n\r\nBut on the whole, Lassalle was a _vis intemperata_. He was deficient in\r\nsober-mindedness, self-control, and in that saving gift of common sense,\r\nwithout which the highest endowments may be unprofitable and even\r\nhurtful to their possessors and to the world. His ambitions were not\r\npure; he had a histrionic as well as a revolutionary temperament; he was\r\nlacking also in self-respect; above all, he had not sufficient reverence\r\nfor the great and sacred cause of which he had become the champion, a\r\ncause which is fitted to claim the highest motives, the purest\r\nambitions, the most noble enthusiasms. His vanity, his want of\r\nself-restraint, his deficient sense of the seriousness of his mission as\r\na Social Democratic leader, in these we see the failings that proved his\r\nundoing. Throughout the miserable intrigue in which he met his death a\r\nsimple, straightforward sense of what was right and becoming would at\r\nonce have saved him from ruin. Yet he was privileged to inaugurate a\r\ngreat movement. As the founder of the Social Democracy of Germany, he\r\nhas earned a place on the roll of historic names. He possessed in a\r\nnotable degree the originality, energy, and sympathy which fit a man to\r\nbe the champion of a new cause.\r\n\r\nWe may go further and say that at that date Germany had only two men\r\nwhose insight into the facts and tendencies of their time was in some\r\nreal degree adequate to the occasion—Bismarck and Lassalle. The former\r\nrepresented a historic cause, which was ready for action, the\r\nregeneration and unification of Germany to be accomplished by the\r\nPrussian army. The cause which Lassalle brought to the front was at a\r\nvery different stage of progress. The working men, its promoters and\r\nrepresentatives, and Lassalle, its champion, had not attained to\r\nanything like clearness either as to the end to be gained or the means\r\nfor accomplishing it. It was only at the crudest and most confused\r\ninitial stage.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[1] The most important works of Lassalle are mentioned in the text. See\r\nGeorg Brandes, _Ferdinand Lassalle_; Franz Mehring, _Die Deutsche\r\nSocial-demokratie, ihre Geschichte und ihre Lehre_; W. H. Dawson,\r\n_German Socialism and Ferdinand Lassalle_.\r\n\r\n[2] Schulze-Delitzsch was born in 1808 at Delitzsch, in Prussian Saxony,\r\nwhence the second part of his name, to distinguish him from the many\r\nother people in Germany who bear the familiar name of Schulze. It was\r\nhis great merit that he founded the co-operative movement in Germany on\r\nprinciples of self-help. He was a leading member of the Progressist\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n[3] In contrast to the unequal and indirect system existing in Prussia,\r\naccording to which the voters are on a property basis divided into three\r\nclasses. The voters thus arranged choose bodies of electors, by whom the\r\nmembers for the Chamber are chosen.\r\n\r\n[4] Bastiat was the populariser in France of the orthodox Political\r\nEconomy. Lassalle accused Schulze of being a mere echo of Bastiat’s\r\nsuperficial views, and therefore called him Bastiat-Schulze.\r\n\r\n                        II. Theories of Lassalle\r\n\r\nThe socialistic position of Lassalle may generally be described as\r\nsimilar to that of Rodbertus and Karl Marx. He admits his indebtedness\r\nto both of those writers, but at the same time he cannot be regarded as\r\na disciple of either of them. Lassalle himself was a thinker of great\r\noriginal power; he had his own way of conceiving and expressing the\r\nhistoric socialism.\r\n\r\nLassalle supplies the key to his general position in the preface to his\r\n_Bastiat-Schulze_, when, quoting from his _System of Acquired Rights_,\r\nhe says: In social matters the world is confronted with the question,\r\nwhether now when property in the direct utilisation of another man no\r\nlonger exists, such property in his indirect exploitation should\r\ncontinue—that is, whether the free realisation and development of our\r\nlabour-force should be the exclusive private property of the possessor\r\nof capital, and whether the employer as such, and apart from the\r\nremuneration of his intellectual labour, should be permitted to\r\nappropriate the result of other men’s labours.[1] This sentence, he\r\nsays, contains the programme of a national-economic work, which he\r\nintended to write under the title, _Outlines of a Scientific National\r\nEconomy_. In this sentence also, we need not say, the fundamental\r\nposition of socialism is implied. He was about to carry out his project\r\nwhen the Leipsic Central Committee brought the question before him in a\r\npractical form. The agitation broke out and left him no leisure for such\r\na work. But he had often lamented that the exposition of the theory had\r\nnot preceded the practical agitation, and that a scientific basis had\r\nnot been provided for it.\r\n\r\nThe _Bastiat-Schulze_ was itself a controversial work, written to meet\r\nthe needs of the hour. Lassalle has never given a full and systematic\r\nexposition of his socialistic theory. All his social-economic writings\r\nwere published as the crises of his agitation seemed to demand. But, as\r\nhe himself says, they compensate by the life and incisiveness of the\r\npolemical form of treatment for what they lose in systematic value. We\r\nmay add that it is often a scientific gain, for in the career of\r\nLassalle we see socialism confronted with fact, and thereby to a large\r\nextent saved from the absoluteness, abstractness, and deficient sense of\r\nreality which detract so much from the value of the works of Marx and\r\nRodbertus. The excessive love of system so characteristic of German\r\ntheorists may be as remote from historic reality and possibility as the\r\nutopian schemes of French socialists. It is, however, also a natural\r\nresult of Lassalle’s mode of presentation that he is not always\r\nconsistent with himself either on practical or theoretical questions,\r\nespecially in his attitude towards the Prussian State.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, we can most clearly and comprehensively bring out the\r\nviews of Lassalle if we follow the order in which they are presented in\r\nhis three leading works, the _Working Men’s Programme_, the _Open\r\nLetter_, and the _Bastiat-Schulze_.\r\n\r\nThe central theme of the _Working Men’s Programme_ is the _vocation of\r\nthe working class_ as the makers and representatives of a new era in the\r\nhistory of the world. We have seen that Lassalle’s _System of Acquired\r\nRights_ was an application of the historical method to legal ideas and\r\ninstitutions. In his social-economic writings we find the application of\r\nthe same method to economic facts and institutions. The _Working Men’s\r\nProgramme_ is a brilliant example of the historical method, and indeed\r\nis a lucid review of the economic development of Europe, culminating in\r\nthe working men’s State, the full-grown democracy.\r\n\r\nIn the mediæval world the owners of land controlled politics, the army,\r\nlaw, and taxation in their own interest, while labour was oppressed and\r\ndespised. The present _régime_ of the capitalist classes is due to a\r\ngradual process of development continued for centuries, and is the\r\nproduct of many forces which have acted and reacted on each other: the\r\ninvention of the mariner’s compass and of gunpowder; abroad the\r\ndiscovery of America and of the sea-route to India; at home the\r\noverthrow of the feudal houses by a central government, which\r\nestablished a regular justice, security of property, and better means of\r\ncommunication. This was to be followed in time by the development of\r\nmachinery, like the cotton-spinning machine of Arkwright, itself the\r\nliving embodiment of the industrial and economic revolution, which was\r\ndestined to produce a corresponding political change. The new machinery,\r\nthe large industry, the division of labour, cheap goods, and the\r\nworld-market—these were all parts of an organic whole. Production in\r\nmass made cheap goods possible; the cheapening of commodities called\r\nforth a wider market, and the wider market led to a still larger\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nThe rulers of the industrial world, the capitalists, became the rulers\r\nalso of the political; the French Revolution was merely a proclamation\r\nof a mighty fact which had already established itself in the most\r\nadvanced portions of Europe. But the marvellous enthusiasm of the\r\nRevolution was kindled by the fact that its champions at the time\r\nrepresented the cause of humanity. Before long, however, it became\r\nmanifest that the new rulers fought for the interests of a class, the\r\n_bourgeoisie_; and another class, that of the proletariat, or\r\nunpropertied workers, began to define itself in opposition to them. Like\r\ntheir predecessors, the _bourgeoisie_ wielded the legal and political\r\npower for their own selfish ends. They made wealth the test and basis of\r\npolitical and social right; they established a restricted franchise;\r\nshackled the free expression of opinion by cautions and taxes on\r\nnewspapers, and threw the burden of taxation on the working classes.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the development of the middle class was a slow and\r\ngradual process, the complex result of a complex mass of forces.\r\nConsidering that the special theme of the _Working Men’s Programme_ is\r\nthe historical function of the working class, it is certainly a most\r\nserious defect of Lassalle’s exposition that he says so little of the\r\ncauses which have conditioned the development of the working class as\r\nthe representatives of a new era. Their appearance on the pages of\r\nLassalle as the supporters of a great _rôle_ is far too sudden.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of February 1848, he says, broke the first dawn of a new\r\nhistorical period. On that day in France a revolution broke out, which\r\ncalled a workman into the Provisional Government; which declared the aim\r\nof the State to be the improvement of the lot of the working class; and\r\nwhich proclaimed direct and universal suffrage, whereby every citizen\r\nwho had attained the age of twenty-one should, without regard to\r\nproperty, have an equal share in all political activity. The working\r\nclass were therefore destined to be the rulers and makers of a new\r\nsociety. But the rule of the working class had this enormous difference\r\nfrom other forms of class rule, that it admits of no special privilege.\r\n\r\nWe are all workers, in so far as we have the will in any way to make\r\nourselves useful to the human society. The working class is therefore\r\nidentical with the whole human race. Its cause is in truth the cause of\r\nentire humanity, its freedom is the freedom of humanity itself, its rule\r\nis the rule of all.\r\n\r\nThe formal means of realising this is direct universal suffrage, which\r\nis no magic wand, but which at least can rectify its own mistakes. It is\r\nthe lance which heals the wounds itself has made. Under universal\r\nsuffrage the legislature is the true mirror of the people that has\r\nchosen it, reflecting its defects, but its progress also, for which it\r\naffords unlimited expression and development.\r\n\r\nThe people must therefore always regard direct universal suffrage as its\r\nindispensable political weapon, as the most fundamental and weightiest\r\nof its demands. And we need not fear that they will abuse their power;\r\nfor while the position and interests of the old privileged classes\r\nbecame inconsistent with the general progress of humanity, the mass of\r\nthe people must know that their interests can be advanced only by\r\npromoting the good of their whole class. Even a very moderate sense of\r\ntheir own welfare must teach them that each individual can separately do\r\nvery little to improve his condition. They can prevail only by union.\r\nThus their personal interest, instead of being opposed to the movement\r\nof history, coincides with the development of the whole people and is in\r\nharmony with freedom, culture, and the highest ideas of our time.\r\n\r\nThis masterly treatise of Lassalle concludes with an appeal to the\r\nworking class, in which we see the great agitator reach the high level\r\nof a pure and noble eloquence. Having shown at length that the working\r\nclass are called to be the creators and representatives of a new\r\nhistorical era, he proceeds: ‘From what we have said there follows for\r\nall who belong to the working class the duty of an entirely new bearing.\r\n\r\n‘Nothing is more suited to stamp on a class a worthy and deeply moral\r\nimpress than the consciousness that it is called to be the ruling class,\r\nthat it is appointed to raise its principle to be the principle of an\r\nentire epoch, to make its idea the ruling idea of the whole society, and\r\nso again to mould society after its own pattern. The high world-historic\r\nhonour of this vocation must occupy all your thoughts. The vices of the\r\noppressed, the idle amusements of the thoughtless, and the harmless\r\nfrivolity of the unimportant beseem you no longer. Ye are the rock on\r\nwhich the church of the future should be built.’\r\n\r\nPity that in the miserable squabble which terminated his life he did not\r\nrealise that the leader of the working class should also be inspired by\r\na sense of the nobility of his calling.\r\n\r\nThis exposition of the vocation of the working class is closely\r\nconnected with another notable feature of Lassalle’s teaching, his\r\n_Theory of the State_. Lassalle’s theory of the State differs entirely\r\nfrom that generally held by the Liberal school. The Liberal school hold\r\nthat the function of the State consists simply in protecting the\r\npersonal freedom and the property of the individual. This he scouts as a\r\nnight-watchman’s idea, because it conceives the State under the image of\r\na night-watchman, whose sole function it is to prevent robbery and\r\nburglary.\r\n\r\nIn opposition to this narrow idea of the State, Lassalle quotes\r\napprovingly the view of August Boeckh: ‘That we must widen our notion of\r\nthe State so as to believe that the State is the institution in which\r\nthe whole virtue of humanity should be realised.’\r\n\r\nHistory, Lassalle tells us, is an incessant struggle with Nature, with\r\nthe misery, ignorance, poverty, weakness, and unfreedom in which the\r\nhuman race was originally placed.[2] The progressive victory over this\r\nweakness, that is the development of the freedom which history depicts.\r\n\r\nIn this struggle, if the individual had been left to himself, he could\r\nhave made no progress. The State it is which has the function to\r\naccomplish this development of freedom, this development of the human\r\nrace in the way of freedom. The duty of the State is to enable the\r\nindividual to reach a sum of culture, power, and freedom, which for\r\nindividuals would be absolutely unattainable. The aim of the State is to\r\nbring human nature to positive unfolding and progressive development—in\r\nother words, to realise the chief end of man: it is the education and\r\ndevelopment of the human race in the way of freedom.\r\n\r\nThe State should be the complement of the individual. It must be ready\r\nto offer a helping hand, wherever and whenever individuals are unable to\r\nrealise the happiness, freedom, and culture which befit a human being.\r\n\r\nSave the State, that primitive vestal fire of culture, from the modern\r\nbarbarians, he exclaims on another occasion.\r\n\r\nTo these political conceptions Lassalle is true throughout. It certainly\r\nis a nobler and more rational ideal of the State than the once prevalent\r\nManchester theory. When we descend from theory to practice all obviously\r\ndepends on what kind of State we have got, and on the circumstances and\r\nconditions under which it is called upon to act.\r\n\r\nThat the State should, through its various organs, support and develop\r\nindividual effort, calling it forth, rendering it hopeful and effectual,\r\nnever weakening the springs of it, but stimulating and completing it, is\r\na position which most thinkers would now accept. And most will admit\r\nwith regret that the existing State is too much a great taxing and\r\nfighting machine. The field of inquiry here opened up is a wide and\r\ntempting one, on which we cannot now enter. We are at present concerned\r\nwith the fact that the State help contemplated by Lassalle was meant not\r\nonly to leave the individual free, but to further him in the free\r\nrealisation of himself.\r\n\r\nThe _Iron Law of Wages_ may well be described as the key to Lassalle’s\r\nsocial-economic position. It holds the same prominent place in his\r\nsystem of thinking as the theory of surplus value does in that of Marx.\r\nBoth, it may be added, are only different aspects of the same fact.\r\nLassalle insists chiefly on the small share of the produce of labour\r\nwhich goes to the labourer; Marx traces the history of the share, called\r\nsurplus value, which goes to the capitalist.\r\n\r\nLassalle’s most careful statement of the Iron Law, to which he\r\nfrequently recurs in subsequent writings, is contained in his _Open\r\nLetter_ (p. 13). ‘The Iron Economic Law, which, in existing\r\ncircumstances, under the law of supply and demand for labour, determines\r\nthe wage, is this: that the average wage always remains reduced to the\r\nnecessary provision which, according to the customary standard of\r\nliving, is required for subsistence and for propagation. This is the\r\npoint about which the real wage continually oscillates, without ever\r\nbeing able long to rise above it or to fall below it. It cannot\r\npermanently rise above this average level, because in consequence of the\r\neasier and better condition of the workers there would be an increase of\r\nmarriages and births among them, an increase of the working population\r\nand thereby of the supply of labour, which would bring the wage down to\r\nits previous level or even below it. On the other hand, the wage cannot\r\npermanently fall below this necessary subsistence, because then occur\r\nemigration, abstinence from marriage, and, lastly, a diminution of the\r\nnumber of workmen caused by their misery, which lessens the supply of\r\nlabour, and therefore once more raises the wage to its previous rate.’\r\n\r\nOn a nearer consideration, Lassalle goes on to say, the effect of the\r\nIron Law is as follows:—\r\n\r\n‘From the produce of labour so much is taken and distributed among the\r\nworkmen as is required for their subsistence.\r\n\r\n‘The entire surplus of production falls to the capitalist. It is\r\ntherefore a result of the Iron Law that the workman is necessarily\r\nexcluded from the benefits of an increasing production, from the\r\nincreased productivity of his own labour.’[3]\r\n\r\nSuch is Lassalle’s theory of the Iron Law of Wages. He accepts it as\r\ntaught by Ricardo and the economists of the orthodox school in England,\r\nFrance, and Germany. We believe that his statement of it is\r\nsubstantially just and accurate; that it fairly reflects the economic\r\nscience of his time, and, under the then prevailing economic conditions,\r\nmay be described as a valid law.\r\n\r\nLassalle held that the customary standard of living and the operation of\r\nthe law generally were subject to variation. Still it may reasonably be\r\nmaintained that he has not sufficiently considered the fact that, like\r\ncapital, the Iron Law of Wages is an historical category. He has not\r\noverlooked the fact, and could hardly do so, as the Iron Law is an\r\nimplicate and result of the domination of capital. But his method of\r\nexposition is too much the controversial one, of pressing it as an\r\n_argumentum ad hominem_ against his opponents in Germany, and, as usual,\r\nin controversy truth is liable to suffer. It may therefore be argued\r\nthat under the competitive system as now existing, changes have occurred\r\nwhich render Lassalle’s theory of the Iron Law inaccurate and untenable.\r\nEven while the present system continues to prevail, the law may undergo\r\nvery extensive modification through the progress of education and\r\norganisation among the workmen, and through the general advance of\r\nsociety in morality and enlightenment. The question of modification of\r\nthe Iron Law is one of degree, and it may fairly be contended by critics\r\nof Lassalle that he has not recognised it to a sufficient degree.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it may also be rationally maintained that in so far\r\nas education and organisation prevail among the workmen, in so far does\r\ncapitalism, with all its conditions and implicates, tend to be\r\nsuperseded. Trade Unions, Co-operative Societies, Factory Legislation,\r\nare all forms of the social control of economic processes, inconsistent\r\nwith competitive economics. The more they gain ground, the more does\r\ncapitalism tend to break up and disappear. From this higher point of\r\nview, we may fairly contend that considerations which have been urged as\r\ndestructive of Lassalle’s argument are really symptoms of the decline of\r\ncapitalism. The Iron Law is an inevitable result of the historical\r\nconditions contemplated by Lassalle. These conditions have changed, but\r\nthe change means that capitalism is passing away. We are thus thrown\r\nback on the wider question, whether capitalism is disappearing, a\r\nquestion which it would at present be premature to discuss.\r\n\r\nIn any case the position of Lassalle is perfectly clear. He accepted the\r\northodox political economy in order to show that the inevitable\r\noperation of its laws left no hope for the working class; and that no\r\nremedy could be found except by abolishing the conditions in which those\r\nlaws have their validity—in other words, by abolishing the present\r\nrelations of labour and capital altogether. The great aim of his\r\nagitation was to bring forward a scheme which would strike at the root\r\nof the evil. The remedy for the evil condition of things connected with\r\nthe Iron Law of Wages is to secure the workmen the full produce of their\r\nlabour, by combining the functions of workmen and capitalists through\r\nthe establishment of productive associations. The distinction between\r\nlabourer and capitalist is thereby abolished. The workman becomes\r\nproducer, and for remuneration receives the entire produce of his\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\nThe associations founded by Schulze-Delitzsch, Lassalle went on to\r\nargue, would effect no substantial improvement in the condition of the\r\nworking class. The unions for the supply of credit and raw materials do\r\nnot benefit the working class as such, but only the small hand-workers.\r\nBut hand-labour is an antiquated form of industry, which is destined to\r\nsuccumb before the large industry equipped with machinery and an\r\nadequate capital. To provide the hand-workers with the means of\r\ncontinuing their obsolete trades is only to prolong the agony of an\r\nassured defeat.\r\n\r\nThe consumers’ unions, or co-operative stores as we call them in\r\nEngland, also fail, because they do not help the workman at the point\r\nwhere he needs it most, as producers. Before the seller, as before the\r\npoliceman, all men are equal; the only thing the seller cares for is\r\nthat his customers are able to pay. In discussing the Iron Law, we saw\r\nthat the workman must be helped as producer—that is, in securing a\r\nbetter share of his product. The consumers’ unions may indeed give a\r\nrestricted and temporary relief. So long as the unions include only a\r\nlimited number of workmen, they afford relief by cheapening the means of\r\nsubsistence, inasmuch as they do not lower the general rate of wages.\r\nBut in proportion as the unions embrace the entire working class and\r\nthereby cause a general cheapening of the means of subsistence, the Iron\r\nLaw of Wages will take effect. For the average wage is only the\r\nexpression in money of the customary means of subsistence. The average\r\nwage will fall in proportion to the general cheapening of the means of\r\nsubsistence, and all the pains taken by the workmen in founding and\r\nconducting the consumers’ unions will be labour lost. They will only\r\nenable the workman to subsist on a smaller wage.\r\n\r\nThe only effectual way to improve the condition of the working class is\r\nthrough the free individual association of the workers, by its\r\napplication and extension to the great industry. The working class must\r\nbe its own capitalist.\r\n\r\nBut when the workmen on the one hand contemplate the enormous sums\r\nrequired for railways and factories, and on the other hand consider the\r\nemptiness of their own pockets, they may naturally ask where they are to\r\nobtain the capital needed for the great industry? The State alone can\r\nfurnish it; and the State ought to furnish it, because it is, and always\r\nhas been, the duty of the State to promote and facilitate the great\r\nprogressive movements of civilisation. _Productive association with\r\nState credit_ was the plan of Lassalle.[4]\r\n\r\nThe State had already in numerous instances guaranteed its credit for\r\nindustrial undertakings by which the rich classes had benefited—canals,\r\npostal services, banks, agricultural improvements, and especially with\r\nregard to railways. No outcry of socialism or communism had been raised\r\nagainst this form of State help? Then why raise it when the greatest\r\nproblem of modern civilisation was involved—the improvement of the lot\r\nof the working classes? Lassalle’s estimate was, that the loan of a\r\nhundred million thalers (£15,000,000) would be more than sufficient to\r\nbring the principle of association into full movement throughout the\r\nkingdom of Prussia.\r\n\r\nObviously the money required for the promotion of productive\r\nassociations did not require to be actually paid by the Government; only\r\nthe State guarantee for the loan was necessary. The State would see that\r\nproper rules for the associations should be made and observed by them.\r\nIt would reserve to itself the rights of a creditor or sleeping partner.\r\nIt would generally take care that the funds be put to their legitimate\r\nuse. But its control would not pass beyond those reasonable limits: the\r\nassociations would be free; they would be the voluntary act of the\r\nworking men themselves. Above all, the State, thus supporting and\r\ncontrolling the associations, would be a democratic State, elected by\r\nuniversal suffrage, the organ of the workers, who form an overwhelming\r\nmajority of every community.\r\n\r\nBut if we are to conceive the matter in the crudest way and consider the\r\nmoney as actually paid, wherein would the enormity of such a transaction\r\nconsist? The State had spent hundreds of millions in war, to appease the\r\nwounded vanity of royal mistresses, to satisfy the lust of conquest of\r\nprinces, to open up markets for the middle classes; yet when the\r\ndeliverance of humanity is concerned the money cannot be procured!\r\n\r\nFurther, as he takes care to explain, Lassalle did not propose his\r\nscheme of productive associations as the solution of the social\r\nquestion. The solution of the social question would demand generations.\r\nHe proposed his scheme as the means of transition, as the easiest and\r\nmildest means of transition.[5] It was the germ, the organic principle\r\nof an incessant development. Lassalle has indicated, though only in\r\nvague outline, how such an organic development of productive\r\nassociations should proceed. They would begin in populous centres, in\r\ncases where the nature of the industry, and the voluntary inclination of\r\nthe workmen to association, would facilitate their formation.\r\nIndustries, which are mutually dependent and work into each other’s\r\nhands, would be united by a credit union; and there would further be an\r\ninsurance union, embracing the different associations, which would\r\nreduce their losses to a minimum. The risks would be greatly lessened as\r\na speculative industry constantly tending to anarchy, and all the evils\r\nof competition would be superseded by an organised industry;\r\nover-production would give place to production in advance. In this way\r\nthe associations would grow until they embraced the entire industry of\r\nthe country. And the general application of the principle would give an\r\nenormous advantage in international competition to the country adopting\r\nit, for it would be rational, systematic, and in every way more\r\neffective and economical.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the whole development, as conceived by Lassalle, was a\r\n_collectivism_ of the same type as that contemplated by Marx and\r\nRodbertus. ‘Division of labour,’ he says, ‘is really common labour,\r\nsocial combination for production. This, the real nature of production,\r\nneeds only to be explicitly recognised. In the total production,\r\ntherefore, it is merely requisite to abolish individual portions of\r\ncapital, and to conduct the labour of society, which is already common,\r\nwith the common capital of society, and to distribute the result of\r\nproduction among all who have contributed to it, in proportion to their\r\nperformance.’[6]\r\n\r\nIn the controversial work against Schulze-Delitzsch, Lassalle has at\r\ngreater length expounded his general position in opposition to the\r\nindividualist theories of his opponents. He contends that progress has\r\nnot proceeded from the individual; it has always proceeded from the\r\ncommunity. In this connection he sums up briefly the history of social\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThe entire ancient world, and also the whole mediæval period down to the\r\nFrench Revolution of 1789, sought human solidarity and community in\r\nbondage or subjection.\r\n\r\nThe French Revolution of 1789, and the historical period controlled by\r\nit, rightly incensed at this subjection, sought freedom in the\r\ndissolution of all solidarity and community. Thereby, however, it\r\ngained, not freedom, but license. Because freedom without community is\r\nlicense.\r\n\r\nThe new, the present period, seeks solidarity in freedom.[7] He then\r\nproceeds in his _theory of conjunctures_ to prove that, instead of each\r\nman being economically responsible for what he has done, each man is\r\nreally responsible for what he has not done. The economic fate of the\r\nindividual is determined by circumstances over which he has no control,\r\nor very little. What does Lassalle mean by a _conjuncture_? We can best\r\nunderstand it by reference to a great economic crisis which has occurred\r\nsince his time. No better example of a _conjuncture_ can be found than\r\nin the recent history of British agriculture. In 1876, agriculture,\r\nstill the most important industry of the country, began to be seriously\r\nthreatened by American competition. The crisis caused by the low prices\r\ndue to this competition was greatly aggravated by bad seasons, such as\r\nthat of 1879. The farmers, obliged to pay rent out of capital, were many\r\nof them ruined. In consequence of the diminished application of capital\r\nto land the opportunities of labour were greatly lessened. Rents could\r\nno longer be paid as formerly. All three classes directly concerned in\r\nEnglish agriculture suffered fearfully, without any special individual\r\nresponsibility in the matter. In Ireland, where the difficulty, great in\r\nitself, was intensified by the national idea, an economic crisis grew\r\ninto a great political and imperial crisis. In the eyes of the impartial\r\ninquirer, who of all the millions of sufferers was personally\r\nresponsible?\r\n\r\nSuch wide-spread disasters are common in recent economic history. They\r\nare a necessary result of a competitive system of industry. Lassalle is\r\njustly angry with the one-sided and ill-instructed economists that would\r\nhold the individual responsible for his fate in such a crisis. Statesmen\r\nlittle understand their duty who would leave their subjects without help\r\nin these times of distress. And it must always be a praiseworthy feature\r\nof socialism that it seeks to establish social control of these\r\n_conjunctures_ as far as possible, and to minimise their disastrous\r\neffects by giving social support to those menaced by them.\r\n\r\nThe main burden of the _Bastiat-Schulze_ is Lassalle’s account of\r\ncapital and labour.\r\n\r\nFor Lassalle _capital is a historic category_, a product of historical\r\ncircumstances, the rise of which we can trace, the disappearance of\r\nwhich, under altered circumstances, we can foresee.\r\n\r\nIn other words, capital is the name for a system of economic, social,\r\nand legal conditions, which are the result severally and collectively of\r\na long and gradual process of historical development. The\r\n_Bastiat-Schulze_ is an elucidation of these conditions. The following\r\nmay be taken as a general statement of them:—\r\n\r\n    (1) The division of labour in connection with the large\r\n    industry.\r\n\r\n    (2) A system of production for exchange in the great\r\n    world-markets.\r\n\r\n    (3) Free competition.\r\n\r\n    (4) The instruments of labour, the property of a special class,\r\n    who after paying\r\n\r\n    (5) A class of free labourers in accordance with the Iron Law of\r\n    Wages, pocket the surplus value. Property consists not in the\r\n    fruit of one’s own labour, but in the appropriation of that of\r\n    others. _Eigenthum ist Fremdthum geworden._[8]\r\n\r\nIn this way capital has become an independent, active, and\r\nself-generating power which oppresses its producer. Money makes money.\r\nThe labour of the past, appropriated and capitalised, crushes the labour\r\nof the present. ‘The dead captures the living.’ ‘The instrument of\r\nlabour, which has become independent, and has exchanged _rôles_ with the\r\nworkmen, which has degraded the living workmen to a dead instrument of\r\nlabour, and has developed itself, the dead instrument of labour, into\r\nthe living organ of production—that is capital.’[9] In such highly\r\nmetaphorical language does Lassalle sum up his history of capital. We\r\nhave already commented on that aspect of it, the Iron Law of Wages,\r\nwhich Lassalle has most emphasised. The whole subject is much more\r\ncomprehensively treated in the _Kapital_ of Karl Marx; therefore we need\r\nnot dwell upon it further at present.\r\n\r\nIt will not be wrong, however, to say a word here about the use of the\r\nword capital, as current in the school of socialists to which Lassalle\r\nand Marx belong. It is not applied by them in its purely economic sense,\r\nas wealth utilised for further production: it is used as the name of the\r\nsocial and economic system in which the owners of capital are the\r\ndominant power. With them it is the economic factor as operating under\r\nthe existing legal and social conditions, with all these conditions\r\nclinging to it. It would be much better to restrict the word to its\r\nproper economic use, and employ the new word capitalism as a fairly\r\naccurate name for the existing system.\r\n\r\nThe function of capital under all social systems and at all historical\r\nepochs is fundamentally the same; it is simply wealth used for the\r\nproduction of more wealth. But the historical, legal, and political\r\nconditions under which it is utilised vary indefinitely, as do also the\r\ntechnical forms in which it is embodied.\r\n\r\nNo real excuse can be offered for the ignorance or confusion of language\r\nof controversialists who maintain that the object of socialism is to\r\nabolish capital. So far from abolishing capital, socialists wish to make\r\nit still more effective for social well-being by placing it under social\r\ncontrol. What they wish to abolish is the existing system, in which\r\ncapital is under the control of a class. It would be a considerable gain\r\nin clearness if this system were always called capitalism.\r\n\r\nWe have already remarked upon Lassalle’s theory of the State, and his\r\ntreatment of the Iron Law of Wages. Our further criticism of his\r\nsocial-economic position can best be brought out by reference to his\r\ncontroversy with Schulze-Delitzsch, the economic representative of\r\nGerman Liberalism.\r\n\r\nIn general it may be said that Lassalle meets the one-sided\r\nindividualism of Schulze by a statement of the socialistic, theory,\r\nwhich is also one-sided and exaggerated. His view of the influence of\r\nthe community as compared with that of the individual is the most\r\nprominent example of this. The only accurate social philosophy is one\r\nwhich gives due attention to both factors; both are of supreme\r\nimportance, and either may fitly be the starting-point of investigation\r\nand discussion.\r\n\r\nHis theory of conjunctures is overstated. It is to a considerable degree\r\nwell founded; in the great economic storms which sweep over the\r\ncivilised world the fate of the individual is largely determined by\r\nconditions over which he has no control. Yet now as ever the homely\r\nvirtues of industry, energy, sobriety, and prudence do materially\r\ndetermine the individual career.\r\n\r\nFor our present purpose, however, it is more important to consider\r\nLassalle’s polemic against the practical proposals of his opponent.\r\nLassalle contended that the unions for providing credit and raw material\r\nwould benefit the hand-workers only, whereas hand-labour is destined to\r\ndisappear before the large industry. But, we may ask, why should not\r\nsuch methods of mutual help be utilised for associations of working men\r\neven more than for isolated workers? These unions may be regarded as\r\naffording only a very partial and limited relief to the workmen, but why\r\nshould the principle of association among workmen stop there?\r\n\r\nThe system of voluntary co-operation must begin somewhere; it began most\r\nnaturally and reasonably with such unions, and it proceeds most\r\nnaturally and reasonably along the line of least resistance to further\r\ndevelopment. In these unions the workmen have been acquiring the capital\r\nand experience necessary for further progress. No limit can be assigned\r\nto the possible evolution of the system. They are properly to be\r\nregarded as only the first beginnings of social control over the\r\neconomic processes, the goal and consummation of which we find in\r\nsocialism. If in the controversial struggle Lassalle had listened to the\r\nclear voice of science, he would have seen that, for his opponent as\r\nwell as for himself, he must maintain that all social institutions are\r\nsubject to and capable of development.\r\n\r\nFor the methods of Schulze it may be claimed that they do not provide a\r\nready-made solution of the social question, but they are a beginning.\r\nFor the associations of Schulze, not less than for those of Lassalle, we\r\nmay contend that they supply the organic principle of an incessant\r\ndevelopment. In this way the workmen may attain to the complete\r\nmanagement of their own industrial interests with their own joint\r\ncapital. They may thus obtain for themselves the full product of their\r\nlabour, in which case the objection of Lassalle, with regard to the\r\nincrease of population, under the influence of the cheap provisions\r\nsupplied by the stores, would no more apply to the scheme of Schulze\r\nthan they would to his own. In both cases we are to suppose that the\r\nmeans of subsistence would be more abundant and more easily obtained; in\r\nboth cases there might be the risk of a too rapidly increasing\r\npopulation. We may suppose that this increase of population would be met\r\nby a still greater increase in the product of labour, all going to the\r\nworkers. But for the schemes of Schulze there would be this great\r\nadvantage that, the capital and experience of the workers having been\r\nacquired by their own exertions, they would have all the superior\r\ntraining requisite for the solution of the population question, and all\r\nother questions, which can be obtained only from a long course of social\r\ndiscipline.\r\n\r\nLassalle would have done well to remember his own statement, that the\r\nonly real point of difference between them was, that one believed in\r\nState help, and the other in ‘self help.’ And we may further ask, Do the\r\ntwo exclude each other?\r\n\r\nIn fact, the controversy, considered purely on its merits, was barren\r\nenough. Yet it led to profitable results, inasmuch as it directed the\r\nmind of Germany to the questions involved, and led to a more thorough\r\ndiscussion of them.\r\n\r\nBetter, however, than any argument which can be urged is the verdict of\r\nhistory on the merits of the question, as already pronounced during the\r\nperiod which has elapsed since the date of the controversy. In 1885,\r\njust twenty-one years after the bitter controversy between the two\r\nrepresentatives of State help and self help, the societies established\r\nby Schulze in Germany alone possessed one hundred million thalers of\r\ncapital of their own. It will be remembered that this is the amount of\r\nthe loan required by Lassalle from the State to bring his productive\r\nassociations into operation. If the workmen fail in productive\r\nassociation, it will not be, as Lassalle maintained, for want of\r\ncapital. Productive association with State credit is therefore not the\r\nonly way out of the wilderness.\r\n\r\nMust we go further and say that Lassalle’s method of State help was not\r\nthe right method at all? It is certain that the Government of Germany,\r\nthough organised on the principle of universal suffrage, has _not_\r\ngranted the credit demanded by Lassalle, and that his agitation in this\r\nmatter has failed owing, it might be alleged, to his early death, and to\r\nthe fact that since his time German socialism has prematurely moved on\r\ninternational, and even anti-national, lines, thus alienating from\r\nitself the sympathies of the Emperor and his Chancellor. We need not say\r\nhow very improbable it is that the German Government would have\r\nguaranteed its credit, however submissive and conciliatory the attitude\r\nof the Social Democrats might have been. The Social Democrats\r\nthemselves, though they gave a place to Lassalle’s scheme on the Gotha\r\nprogramme of 1875, seem now disposed to attach little or no importance\r\nto it. It does not appear in the Erfurt programme of the party, which\r\nwas adopted in 1891. In short, Lassalle’s agitation has in the point\r\nimmediately in question been a failure. At the same time, it would be\r\nabsolutely incorrect to assert that experience has pronounced against\r\nhis scheme, inasmuch as no Government has ever seriously taken it in\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nLike many other pioneers, Lassalle has not accomplished what he\r\nintended, yet he has achieved great results. We cannot quite accept the\r\ndictum of Schiller, that the world’s history is the world’s judgment. We\r\nare not prepared to believe that all things that have succeeded were\r\ngood, and all things that have failed were evil; or that things are good\r\nor evil only in so far as they succeed or fail. Still, we may well sum\r\nup the controversy between Lassalle and Schulze by stating that in 1885\r\nthe societies founded by the latter had in Germany a membership of\r\n1,500,000 with a capital of £15,000,000, and at the election of 1890 the\r\nSocial Democracy of Germany, originated by Lassalle, polled 1,427,000\r\nvotes. Both have done great things, which are destined to be greater\r\nstill. In this, as in so many other instances, the course of history has\r\nnot respected the narrow limits prescribed to it by controversialists.\r\n\r\nWe need not, however, insist further on the details of Lassalle’s\r\ncontroversy with Schulze-Delitzsch. Much more important is it to recall\r\nthe leading aspects of his teaching. What Lassalle contemplated and\r\ncontended for was a democracy in which the claims of Might and Right\r\nshould be reconciled, a democracy of working men, guided by science, and\r\nthrough universal suffrage constituting a State which would rise to the\r\nhigh level of its function as representative and promoter of freedom,\r\nculture, morality, and progress in the fullest and deepest significance\r\nof those great ideas. Above all, this democracy was to be a social\r\ndemocracy, in which the political idea should be subordinate to the\r\nsocial; hence the duty of the State at least to initiate the solution of\r\nthe social question by granting credit for productive associations. But\r\nthis was only to be a beginning; the solution of the social question\r\nmust be ardently worked out for generations until labour should be\r\nentirely emancipated.\r\n\r\nWith such an ideal, contrast the Prussian-German State as it actually\r\nis. The German State must still find its basis in the army and police,\r\nthe most intelligent of the working class being in profound discontent.\r\nIt is a fact worth considering by our economists and politicians, that\r\nthe _élite_ of the working men of probably the best educated and most\r\nthoughtful nation in the world have gone over to the Social Democratic\r\nparty. Nor can the German or any other State devote itself heartily to\r\nthe solution of the social question, for Europe is like a vast camp, in\r\nwhich science and finance are strained to the uttermost in order to\r\ndevise and provide instruments for the destruction of our fellow-men. Of\r\nthis state of things the young Emperor who ascended the throne in 1888\r\nis only the too willing representative; but even if he were inclined, he\r\nwould be powerless to prevent it, as its causes are too deeply rooted in\r\nhuman nature and in the present stage of social development to be\r\nremoved by anything less than a profound change in the motives and\r\nconditions of life. The historical antecedents and geographical position\r\nof Germany are such that it must long continue to be a military State;\r\nand most other nations have hindrances of their own. Reformers must\r\ntherefore wait long and strive earnestly before they can hope to see\r\nsuch an ideal as that of Lassalle realised. That the ideal was a noble\r\none, and that the gratitude of all lovers of progress is due to him for\r\nhis energetic and eloquent advocacy of it, notwithstanding certain\r\nunworthy passages in his career, few will deny.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[1] _Bastiat-Schulze_, p. iii., Berlin 1878.\r\n\r\n[2] See _Working Men’s Programme_.\r\n\r\n[3] See _Open Letter_.\r\n\r\n[4] See _Open Letter_, passim.\r\n\r\n[5] See _Bastiat-Schulze_, p. 189.\r\n\r\n[6] _Bastiat-Schulze_, p. 188.\r\n\r\n[7] _Bastiat-Schulze_, p. 18.\r\n\r\n[8] _Bastiat-Schulze_, p. 186.\r\n\r\n[9] _Ibid._, p. 181.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                              _RODBERTUS_\r\n\r\nTo those who identify socialism with the extreme revolutionary spirit,\r\nRodbertus is naturally an enigma. Everything characteristic of Rodbertus\r\nis an express contradiction of their notion of a socialist. He was a\r\nPrussian lawyer and landowner, a quiet and cultured student, who\r\ndisliked revolution and even agitation. It was a marked feature of his\r\nteaching also, that he meant the socialist development to proceed on\r\nnational lines and under national control. Yet it is impossible to give\r\nany reasonable account of socialism that will exclude Rodbertus. Clearly\r\nthe only right way out of the dilemma for those who are caught in it is\r\nto widen their conception of the subject; and Rodbertus will become\r\nperfectly clear and intelligible.\r\n\r\nKarl Johann Rodbertus, by some considered to be the founder of\r\nscientific socialism, was born at Greifswald on 12th August 1805, his\r\nfather being a professor at the university there. He studied law at\r\nGöttingen and Berlin, thereafter engaging in various legal occupations;\r\nand, after travelling for some time, he bought the estate of Jagetzow,\r\nin Pomerania, whence his name of Rodbertus-Jagetzow. In 1836 he settled\r\non this estate, and henceforward devoted his life chiefly to economic\r\nand other learned studies, taking also some interest in local and\r\nprovincial affairs.\r\n\r\nAfter the revolution of March 1848 Rodbertus was elected member of the\r\nPrussian National Assembly, in which body he belonged to the Left\r\nCentre; and for fourteen days he filled the post of Minister of Public\r\nWorship and Education. He sat for Berlin in the Second Chamber of 1849,\r\nand moved the adoption of the Frankfort imperial constitution, which was\r\ncarried. Then came the failure of the revolutionary movement in Prussia,\r\nas elsewhere in Europe, and Rodbertus retired into private life. When\r\nthe system of dividing the Prussian electorate into three classes was\r\nadopted, Rodbertus recommended abstention from voting. His only\r\nsubsequent appearance in public life was his candidature for the first\r\nNorth German Diet, in which he was defeated.\r\n\r\nHis correspondence with Lassalle was an interesting feature of his life.\r\nAt one time Rodbertus had some intention of forming a social party with\r\nthe help of the conservative socialist Rudolf Meyer and of Hasenclever,\r\na prominent follower of Lassalle; but no progress was made in this.\r\nRodbertus was neither disposed nor qualified to be an agitator, being a\r\nman of a calm and critical temperament, who believed that society could\r\nnot be improved by violent changes, but by a long and gradual course of\r\ndevelopment. He warned the working men of Germany against connecting\r\nthemselves with any political party, enjoining them to be a social party\r\npure and simple. He died on 8th December 1875.\r\n\r\nThe general position of Rodbertus was ‘social, monarchical, and\r\nnational.’ With his entire soul he held the purely economic part of the\r\ncreed of the German Social Democratic party, yet he did not agree with\r\ntheir methods, and had no liking for the productive associations with\r\nState help of Lassalle. He regarded a socialistic republic as a possible\r\nthing, but he cordially accepted the monarchic institution in his own\r\ncountry, and hoped that a German emperor might undertake the _rôle_ of a\r\nsocial emperor. He was also a true patriot, and was proud and hopeful of\r\nthe career that lay before the regenerated empire of Germany.\r\n\r\nThe basis of the economic teaching of Rodbertus is the principle laid\r\ndown by Adam Smith and Ricardo, and insisted on by all the later\r\nsocialists, that labour is the source and measure of value. In\r\nconnection with this he developed the position that rent, profit, and\r\nwages are all parts of a national income produced by the united organic\r\nlabour of the workers of the community. Consequently there can be no\r\ntalk of the wages of labour being paid out of capital; wages is only\r\nthat part of the national income which is received by the workmen, of a\r\nnational income which they have themselves entirely produced. The wages\r\nfund theory is thus summarily disposed of.\r\n\r\nBut the most important result of the theory is his position that the\r\npossession of land and capital enables the landholders and capitalists\r\nto compel the workmen to divide the product of their labour with those\r\nnon-working classes, and in such a proportion that the workers only\r\nobtain as much as can support them in life. Thus the Iron Law of Wages\r\nis established. Hence also Rodbertus deduces his theory of commercial\r\ncrises and of pauperism, and in the following way: In spite of the\r\nincreasing productivity of labour, the workers obtain in general only\r\nsufficient to support their class, and therefore a smaller relative\r\nshare of the national income. But the producers form also the large mass\r\nof consumers, and, with the decline of their relative share in the\r\nnational income, must decline the relative purchasing power of this\r\nlarge class of the people. The growing production is not met by a\r\ncorrespondingly growing consumption; expansion is succeeded by\r\ncontraction of production, by a scarcity of employment, and a further\r\ndecline in purchasing power on the part of the workers. Thus we have a\r\ncommercial crisis bringing with it pauperism as a necessary result. In\r\nthe meantime the purchasing power of the non-producing capitalists and\r\nlandholders continues relatively to increase; but, as they have already\r\nhad enough to buy all the comforts of life, they spend the more in the\r\npurchase of luxuries, the production of which increases.\r\n\r\nA fundamental part of the teaching of Rodbertus is his theory of social\r\ndevelopment. He recognised three stages in the economic progress of\r\nmankind: (1) the ancient heathen period in which property in human\r\nbeings was the rule; (2) the period of private property in land and\r\ncapital; (3) the period, still remote, of property as dependent on\r\nservice or desert. The goal of the human race is to be one society\r\norganised on a communistic basis; only in that way can the principle\r\nthat every man be rewarded according to his work be realised. In this\r\ncommunistic or socialistic State of the future, land and capital will be\r\nnational property, and the entire national production will be under\r\nnational control; and means will be taken so to estimate the labour of\r\neach citizen that he shall be rewarded according to its precise amount.\r\nAn immense staff of State officials will be required for this function.\r\nAs we have already said, Rodbertus believed that this stage of social\r\ndevelopment is yet far distant; he thought that five centuries will need\r\nto pass away before the ethical force of the people can be equal to it.\r\n\r\nFrom what we have already said, it will be understood that by his\r\ntemperament, culture, and social position Rodbertus was entirely averse\r\nto agitation as a means of hastening the new era; and in the measures\r\nwhich he recommends for making the transition towards it he showed a\r\nscrupulous regard for the existing interests of the capitalists and\r\nlandholders. He proposed that those two classes should be left in full\r\npossession of their present share of the national income, but that the\r\nworkers should reap the benefit of the increasing production. To secure\r\nthem this increment of production he proposed that the State should fix\r\na normal working day for the various trades, a normal day’s work, and a\r\nlegal wage, the amount of which should be revised periodically, and\r\nraised according to the increase of production, the better workman\r\nreceiving a better wage. By measures such as these, carried out by the\r\nState in order to correct the evils of competition, would Rodbertus seek\r\nto make the transition into the socialistic era.\r\n\r\nThe economic work of Rodbertus is therefore an attempt made in a\r\ntemperate and scientific spirit to elucidate the evil tendencies\r\ninherent in the competitive system, especially as exemplified in the\r\noperation of the Iron Law of Wages. The remedy he proposes is a State\r\nmanagement of production and distribution, which shall extend more and\r\nmore, till we arrive at a complete and universal socialism—and all\r\nbased on the principle that, as labour is the source of value, so to the\r\nlabourer should all wealth belong.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary further to dwell on the theories of Rodbertus.\r\nThe general outlines of his teaching are clear enough, and the details\r\ncould be properly treated only in a work specially devoted to him. In\r\nsome leading features his economic position is the same as that of Marx\r\nand Lassalle. The chief difference lies in the application of their\r\nprinciples. We have seen that he expects the Prussian or German State to\r\nadopt his theories, but the interest we can have in the very remote\r\nrealisation of them in this way naturally cannot be very great. It was\r\nunreasonable to believe that the people of Germany would make no use of\r\ntheir newly acquired political rights to promote their social claims;\r\nand it is needless to say that a socialistic evolution slowly carried\r\nout under an army of officials is not a very inviting prospect.\r\n\r\nOn the recent political economy of Germany, especially as represented by\r\nAdolf Wagner, Rodbertus has exercised a great influence. For many he is\r\nthe founder of a truly scientific socialism. His criticism of the\r\nleading principles of economics has led them to make important changes\r\nin the statement and treatment of their science.[1]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[1] The following are the most important works of Rodbertus: _Zur\r\nErkenntniss unserer staatswirthschaftlichen Zustände_ (1842); _Sociale\r\nBriefe an von Kirchmann_ (1850); _Creditnoth des Grundbesitzes_ (2nd\r\ned., 1876); ‘Der Normal-arbeitstag,’ in _Tüb.

Zeitschrift_) (1878);\r\nKozak’s work on Rodbertus (1882); an excellent monograph by G. Adler\r\n(Leipsic, 1884); and Prof. Gonner’s _Social Philosophy of Rodbertus_\r\n(London, 1899).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                              _KARL MARX_\r\n\r\nThe greatest and most influential name in the history of socialism is\r\nunquestionably Karl Marx. He and his like-minded companion Engels are\r\nthe acknowledged heads of the ‘scientific and revolutionary’ school of\r\nsocialism, which has its representatives in almost every country of the\r\ncivilised world, and is generally recognised as the most serious and\r\nformidable form of the new teaching.\r\n\r\nLike Ferdinand Lassalle, Karl Marx was of Jewish extraction. It is said\r\nthat from the time of his father, back to the sixteenth century, his\r\nancestors had been rabbis.[1] Marx was born at Treves in 1818, where his\r\nfather belonged to the legal profession. Both parents were highly\r\ncultured and raised above the traditions and prejudices of their race.\r\nIn 1824, when Marx was six years of age, the family passed over from\r\nJudaism to the profession of the Christian faith.\r\n\r\nBrought up under very favourable circumstances, ardent and energetic,\r\nand endowed with the highest natural gifts, the young Marx speedily\r\nassimilated the best learning that. Germany could then provide. At the\r\nuniversities of Bonn and Berlin he studied law to please his father, but\r\nfollowing his own bent he gave his time much more to history and\r\nphilosophy. Hegel was still about the zenith of his influence, and Marx\r\nwas a zealous student, and for some time an adherent of the reigning\r\nschool. In 1841 Marx finished his studies and gained the degree of\r\ndoctor with an essay on the philosophy of Epicurus. This was destined to\r\nclose his connection with the German universities. He had intended to\r\nsettle at Bonn as teacher of philosophy, but the treatment which his\r\nfriend Bruno Bauer as teacher of theology in the same university\r\nexperienced at the hands of the Prussian minister Eichhorn, deterred him\r\nfrom following out his purpose.\r\n\r\nIn truth, Marx’s revolutionary temperament was little suited to the\r\nroutine of the German man of learning, and the political conditions of\r\nPrussia gave no scope for free activity in any department of its\r\nnational life. Marx therefore could only enter the ranks of the\r\nopposition, and early in 1842 he joined the staff of the _Rhenish\r\nGazette_, published at Cologne as an organ of the extreme democracy. He\r\nwas for a short time editor of the paper. During his connection with it\r\nhe carried on an unsparing warfare against the Prussian reaction, and\r\nleft it before its suppression by the Prussian Government, when it\r\nsought by compromise to avoid that fate.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, 1843, Marx married Jenny von Westphalen, who belonged\r\nto a family of good position in the official circles of the Rhine\r\ncountry. Her brother was subsequently Prussian minister. It was a most\r\nhappy marriage. Through all the trials and privations of a revolutionary\r\ncareer Marx found in his wife a brave, steadfast, and sympathetic\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nSoon after his marriage Marx removed to Paris, where he applied himself\r\nto the study of the questions to which his life and activity were\r\nhenceforward to be entirely devoted. All his life he appears to have\r\nworked with extraordinary intensity. At Paris he lived in close\r\nintercourse with the leading French socialists; with Proudhon he often\r\nspent whole nights in the discussion of economic problems. His most\r\nintimate associates, however, were the German exiles. Arnold Ruge and he\r\nedited the _Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher_. He met also the greatest\r\nof the German exiles, Heine, and is said to have had a share in\r\nsuggesting to the poet the writing of the celebrated _Wintermärchen_.\r\n\r\nMost important of all those meetings in Paris, however, was that with\r\nFriedrich Engels. Friedrich Engels was the son of a manufacturer at\r\nBarmen, where he was born in 1820. Brought up to his father’s business,\r\nEngels had resided for some time in Manchester. When he met Marx at\r\nParis in 1844 the two men had already arrived at a complete community of\r\nviews, and for nearly forty years continued to be loyal friends and\r\ncomrades-in-arms.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1845, Marx, at the instance of Prussia, was expelled from Paris\r\nby the Guizot Ministry. Marx settled in Brussels, where he resided three\r\nyears. He gave up his Prussian citizenship without again becoming\r\nnaturalised in any country. It was in 1845 that Engels published his\r\nimportant work, _The Condition of the Working Class in England_. In\r\nBrussels, in 1847, Marx published his controversial work on Proudhon’s\r\n_Philosophie de la Misère_, entitled _Misère de la Philosophie_.\r\nProudhon, it must be remembered, was at that time the leading name in\r\nEuropean socialism, and Marx had been on very intimate terms with him.\r\nMarx’s criticism of his friend is nevertheless most merciless. In\r\ndefense of the German we can but say that such scathing methods were not\r\nunusual at that time, and that where the cause of truth and of the\r\nproletariat as he understood it was concerned, he scorned all manner of\r\ncompromise and consideration for personal feelings. His book on\r\nProudhon, in spite of its controversial form, is interesting as the\r\nfirst general statement of his views.\r\n\r\nThis book on Proudhon scarcely attracted any attention whatever. In the\r\nsame year, 1847, he and his friend Engels had a notable opportunity for\r\nan expression of their common opinions which excited wide attention, and\r\nwhich has had a great and still growing influence in the cause of the\r\nworking man.\r\n\r\nA society of socialists, a kind of forerunner of the International, had\r\nestablished itself in London, and had been attracted by the new theories\r\nof Marx and the spirit of strong and uncompromising conviction with\r\nwhich he advocated them. They entered into relation with Marx and\r\nEngels; the society was reorganised under the name of the Communist\r\nLeague; and a congress was held, which resulted, in 1847, in the framing\r\nof the _Manifesto of the Communist Party_, which was published in most\r\nof the languages of Western Europe, and is the first proclamation of\r\nthat revolutionary socialism armed with all the learning of the\r\nnineteenth century, but expressed with the fire and energy of the\r\nagitator, which in the International and other movements has so startled\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nDuring the revolutionary troubles in 1848 Marx returned to Germany, and\r\nalong with his comrades, Engels, Wolff, etc., he supported the most\r\nadvanced democracy in the _New Rhenish Gazette_. In 1849 he settled in\r\nLondon, where he spent his after-life in the elaboration of his economic\r\nviews and in the realisation of his revolutionary programme. In 1859 he\r\npublished _Zur Kritik der politischen Oekonomie_. This book was for the\r\nmost part incorporated in the first volume of his great work on capital,\r\n_Das Kapital_, which appeared in 1867.[2] Much of his later life was\r\nspent in ill health, due to the excessive work by which he undermined a\r\nconstitution that had originally been exceptionally healthy and\r\nvigorous. He died in London, March 14, 1883. It was a time of the year\r\nwhich had been marked by the outbreak of the Commune at Paris, and is\r\ntherefore for a twofold reason a notable period in the history of the\r\nproletariat.\r\n\r\nSince the death of Marx his great work, _Das Kapital_, has been\r\ncompleted by the publication of the second and third volumes, which have\r\nbeen edited by Engels from manuscripts left by his friend. But neither\r\nof these two volumes has the historical interest which may fairly be\r\nclaimed for the first. In 1877 Engels published on his own account a\r\nwork called _Herrn Eugen Dührings Umwälzung der Wissenschaft_,[3] a\r\ncontroversial treatise against Dühring (a teacher of philosophy in the\r\nuniversity of Berlin) which has had considerable influence on the\r\ndevelopment of the German Social Democracy. Engels died in 1895, after\r\nloyal and consistent service in the cause of the proletariat, which\r\nextended over more than fifty years.\r\n\r\nThe causes which have variously contributed to the rise of German\r\nsocialism are sufficiently clear. With the accession of the romanticist\r\nFrederick William IV. to the throne of Prussia in 1840 German liberalism\r\nreceived a fresh expansion. At the same time the Hegelian school began\r\nto break up, and the interest in pure philosophy began to wane. It was a\r\ntime of disillusionment, of dissatisfaction with idealism, of transition\r\nto realistic and even to materialistic ways of thinking. This found\r\nstrongest expression in the Hegelian left, to which, after the ideals of\r\nthe old religions and philosophies had proved unsubstantial, there\r\nremained as solid residuum the real fact of man with his positive\r\ninterests in this life. The devotion and enthusiasm which had previously\r\nbeen fixed on ideal and spiritual conceptions were concentrated on\r\nhumanity. To adherents of the Hegelian left, who had been delivered from\r\nintellectual routine by the most intrepid spirit of criticism, and who\r\ntherefore had little respect for the conventionalisms of a feudal\r\nsociety, it naturally appeared that the interests of humanity had been\r\ncruelly sacrificed in favour of class privilege and prejudice.\r\n\r\nThe greatest thinkers of Germany had recognised the noble elements in\r\nthe French Revolution. To recognise also the noble and promising\r\nfeatures of French socialism was a natural thing, especially for Germans\r\nwho had been in Paris, the great hearth of the new ideas. Here they\r\nfound themselves definitely and consciously in presence of the last and\r\ngreatest interest of humanity, the suffering and struggling proletariat\r\nof Western Europe, which had so recently made its definite entry in the\r\nhistory of the world. Thus socialism became a social, political, and\r\neconomic creed to Karl Marx and his associates. But they felt that the\r\ntheories which preceded them were wanting in scientific basis; and it\r\nwas henceforward the twofold aim of the school to give scientific form\r\nto socialism, and to propagate it in Europe by the best and most\r\neffective revolutionary methods.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental principle of the Marx school and of the whole cognate\r\nsocialism is the theory of ‘surplus value’—the doctrine, namely, that,\r\nafter the labourer has been paid the wage necessary for the subsistence\r\nof himself and family, the surplus produce of his labour is appropriated\r\nby the capitalist who exploits it. This theory is an application of the\r\nprinciple that labour is the source of value, which was enunciated by\r\nmany of the old writers on economics, such as Locke and Petty, which was\r\nset forth with some vagueness and inconsistency by Adam Smith, and was\r\nmore systematically expounded by Ricardo. The socialistic application of\r\nthe principle in the doctrine of surplus value had been made both by\r\nOwenites and Chartists. It was to prevent this appropriation of surplus\r\nvalue by capitalists and middlemen that the Owen school tried the system\r\nof exchange by labour notes in 1832, the value of goods being estimated\r\nin labour time, represented by labour notes.\r\n\r\nThe principle that labour is the source of value has been accepted in\r\nall its logical consequences by Marx, and by him elaborated with\r\nextraordinary dialectical skill and historical learning into the most\r\ncomplete presentation of socialism that has ever been offered to the\r\nworld. A like application of the principle, but in a less comprehensive\r\nfashion, has been made by Rodbertus; and it is the same theory that\r\nunderlies the extravagances and paradoxes of Proudhon. The question\r\nwhether the priority in the scientific development of the principle is\r\ndue to Marx or Rodbertus cannot be discussed here. But it may be said\r\nthat, the theory had been set forth by Rodbertus in his first work in\r\n1842, that the importance of the principle was understood by the Marx\r\nschool as early as 1845, and that in a broad and general way it had\r\nindeed become the common property of socialists. The historical\r\nimportance and scientific worth of the writings of Rodbertus should not\r\nbe overlooked; nor are they likely to be when so much attention has been\r\ngiven to him by A. Wagner and other distinguished German economists.\r\n\r\nBut in the great work of Marx the socialist theory is elaborated with a\r\nfulness of learning and a logical power to which Rodbertus has no claim.\r\nWith Marx the doctrine of surplus value receives its widest application\r\nand development: it supplies the key to his explanation of the history\r\nand influence of capital, and consequently of the present economic era,\r\nwhich is dominated by it. It is the basis, in fact, of a vast and\r\nelaborate system of social philosophy. In any case it is an absurdity as\r\nwell as an historical error to speak of Marx as having borrowed from\r\nRodbertus. Marx was an independent thinker of great originality and\r\nforce of character, who had made the economic development of modern\r\nEurope the study of a laborious lifetime, and who was in the habit, not\r\nof borrowing, but of strongly asserting the results of his own research\r\nand of impressing them upon other men.\r\n\r\nThe great work of Marx may be described as an exposition and criticism\r\nof capital. But it is also indirectly an exposition of socialism,\r\ninasmuch as the historical evolution of capital is governed by natural\r\nlaws, the inevitable tendency of which is towards socialism. It is the\r\ngreat aim of Marx to reveal the law of the economic movement of modern\r\ntimes. Now, the economic movement of modern times is dominated by\r\ncapital. Explain, therefore, the natural history of capital, the rise,\r\nconsolidation, and decline of its supremacy as an evolutionary process,\r\nand you forecast the nature of that into which it is being\r\ntransformed—socialism. Hence the great task of the Marx school is not\r\nto preach a new economic and social gospel, not to provide ready-made\r\nschemes of social regeneration after the fashion of the early\r\nsocialists, nor to counteract by alleviating measures the wretchedness\r\nof our present system, but to explain and promote the inevitable process\r\nof social evolution, so that the domination of capital may run its\r\ncourse and give place to the higher system that is to come.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic feature of the _régime_ of capital, or, as Marx\r\nusually calls it, the capitalistic method of production, is, that\r\nindustrial operations are carried on by individual capitalists employing\r\nfree labourers, whose sole dependence is the wage they receive. Those\r\nfree labourers perform the function fulfilled in other states of society\r\nby the slave and the serf. In the development of the capitalistic system\r\nis involved the growth of the two classes,—the capitalist class,\r\nenriching itself on the profits of industry, which they control in their\r\nown interest, and the class of workers, nominally free, but without land\r\nor capital, divorced, therefore, from the means of production, and\r\ndependent on their wages—the modern proletariat. The great aim of the\r\ncapitalist is the increase of wealth through the accumulation of his\r\nprofits. This accumulation is secured by the appropriation of what the\r\nsocialists call surplus value. The history of the capitalistic method of\r\nproduction is the history of the appropriation and accumulation of\r\nsurplus value. To understand the capitalistic system is to understand\r\nsurplus value. With the analysis of value, therefore, the great work of\r\nMarx begins.\r\n\r\nThe wealth of the societies in which the capitalistic method of\r\nproduction prevails appears as an enormous collection of commodities. A\r\ncommodity is in the first place an external object adapted to satisfy\r\nhuman wants; and this usefulness gives it value in use, makes it a use\r\nvalue. These use values form the material of wealth, whatever its social\r\nform may be. In modern societies, where the business of production is\r\ncarried on to meet the demands of the market, for exchange, these use\r\nvalues appear as exchange values. Exchange value is the proportion in\r\nwhich use values of different kinds exchange for each other. But the\r\nenormous mass of things that circulate in the world market exchange for\r\neach other in the most different proportion. They must, however, have a\r\ncommon quality, or they could not be compared. This common quality\r\ncannot be any of the natural properties of the commodities. In the\r\nbusiness of exchange one thing is as good as another, provided you have\r\nit in sufficient quantity.\r\n\r\nLeaving out of consideration, therefore, the physical qualities that\r\ngive commodities use value, we find in them but one common\r\ncharacteristic—that they are all products of human labour. They are all\r\ncrystallised forms of human labour. It is labour applied to natural\r\nobjects that gives them value. What constitutes value is the human\r\nlabour embodied in commodities. And the relation of exchange is only a\r\nphase of this value, which is therefore to be considered independently\r\nof it. Further, the labour time spent in producing value is the measure\r\nof value, not this or that individual labour, in which case a lazy or\r\nunskilled man would produce as great a quantity of value as the most\r\nskilful and energetic. We must take as our standard the average labour\r\nforce of the community. The labour time which we take as the measure of\r\nvalue is the time required to produce a commodity under the normal\r\nsocial conditions of production with the average degree of skill and\r\nintensity of labour. Thus labour is both the source and the measure of\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nThe conditions necessary to the existence and growth of capitalism,\r\ntherefore, are as follows:—A class, who have a virtual monopoly of the\r\nmeans of production; another class of labourers, who are free, but\r\ndestitute of the means of production; and a system of production for\r\nexchange in a world market. But it may be asked how these historical\r\nconditions were established? How did the capitalist class originate, and\r\nhow were the workers divorced from the instruments of labour, and how\r\nwas the world market opened up?\r\n\r\nSuch a state of things was established only after a long and gradual\r\nprocess of change, which Marx copiously illustrates from the history of\r\nEngland, as the classic land of the fully developed capitalism. In the\r\nMiddle Ages the craftsman and peasant were the owners of the small means\r\nof production then extant, and they produced for their own needs and for\r\ntheir feudal superior; only the superfluity went into the general\r\nmarket. Such production was necessarily small, limited, and technically\r\nimperfect. Towards the close of the Middle Ages a great change set in,\r\ncaused by a remarkable combination of circumstances—the downfall of the\r\nfeudal system and of the Catholic Church, the discovery of America and\r\nof the sea route to India. Through the breaking-up of the feudal houses\r\nwith their numerous retainers, through the transformation of the old\r\npeasant-holdings into extensive sheep-runs, and generally through the\r\nprevalent application of the commercial system to the management of\r\nland, instead of the Catholic and feudal spirit, the peasantry were\r\ndriven off the land; a multitude of people totally destitute of property\r\nwere thrown loose from their old means of livelihood, and were reduced\r\nto vagabondage or forced into the towns. It was in this way that the\r\nmodern proletarians made their tragic entry in history.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there was a parallel development of the capitalist\r\nclass, brought about by the slave-trade, by the exploitation of the\r\nAmerican colonies and of both the Indies, and by the robbery, violence,\r\nand corruption which attended the transference of the land from the\r\nCatholic and feudal to the modern _régime_. The opening and extension of\r\nthe vast world market, moreover, gave a great stimulus to industry at\r\nhome. The old guilds having already been expropriated and dissolved, the\r\nearly organisation of industry under the control of an infant capitalism\r\npassed through its first painful and laborious stages, till, with the\r\ngreat mechanical inventions, with the application of steam as the\r\nmotive-power, and the rise of the factory system towards the close of\r\nthe eighteenth century, the great industrial revolution was\r\naccomplished, and the capitalistic method of production attained to its\r\ncolossal manhood.\r\n\r\nThus the capitalistic system was established. And we must remember that\r\nin all its forms and through all the stages of its history the great aim\r\nof the capitalist is to increase and consolidate his gains through the\r\nappropriation of surplus value. We have now to inquire how this surplus\r\nvalue is obtained?\r\n\r\nThe starting-point of the capitalistic system is the circulation of\r\nwares. As we have seen, the capitalistic method of production is\r\ndominated by exchange. If exchange, however, consisted merely in the\r\ngiving and receiving of equivalents, there could be no acquisition of\r\nsurplus value. In the process of exchange there must appear something\r\nthe utilisation of which by the buyer yields a greater value than the\r\nprice he pays for it.\r\n\r\nThe thing desired is found in the labour force of the workman, who,\r\nbeing destitute of the means of production, must have recourse to the\r\nowner of these, the capitalist. In other words, the workman appears on\r\nthe market with the sole commodity of which he has to dispose, and sells\r\nit for a specified time at the price it can bring, which we call his\r\nwage, and which is equivalent to the average means of subsistence\r\nrequired to support himself and to provide for the future supply of\r\nlabour (in his family). But the labour force of the workman, as utilised\r\nby the capitalist in the factory or the mine, produces a net value in\r\nexcess of his wage; that is, over and above his entire outlay, including\r\nthe wage paid to his workmen, the capitalist finds himself in possession\r\nof a surplus, which can only represent the unpaid labour of his workmen.\r\nThis surplus is the surplus value of Karl Marx, the product of unpaid\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\nThis appropriation of surplus labour is a very old phenomenon in human\r\nsociety. In all the forms of society which depended on slave-labour, and\r\nunder the feudal _régime_, the appropriation of the results of other\r\nmen’s labour was open, undisguised, and compulsory. Under the\r\ncapitalistic system it is disguised under the form of free contract. The\r\neffect is the same. For the workman who is unprovided with the\r\ninstruments of labour, whose working power is useless without them, this\r\ncompulsion is not less real because it is concealed under the forms of\r\nfreedom. He must agree to this free contract or starve.\r\n\r\nIt is the surplus value thus obtained which the capitalist seeks to\r\naccumulate by all the methods available. These methods are described by\r\nMarx with great detail and elaboration through several hundred pages of\r\nhis first volume. His account, supported at every step by long and\r\ncopious citations from the best historical authorities and from the\r\nblue-books of the various parliamentary commissions, is a lurid and\r\nghastly picture of the many abuses of English industrialism. It is the\r\ndark and gloomy reverse of the industrial glories of England. The\r\nfearful prolongation of the hours of labour, the merciless exploitation\r\nof women and of children from the age of infancy, the utter neglect of\r\nsanitary conditions—whatever could lessen the costs of production and\r\nswell the profits of the capitalist, though every law of man and nature\r\nwere violated in the process; such are the historical facts which Marx\r\nemphasises and illustrates with an overwhelming force of evidence. They\r\nreceive ample confirmation in the history of the English Factory Acts,\r\nimposed on greedy and unscrupulous capitalists after a severe struggle\r\nprolonged for half a century, and required to prevent the moral and\r\nphysical ruin of the industrial population.\r\n\r\nWe must now consider the process of the development of capitalism rather\r\nmore closely.[4] Under the old system industry was carried on by the\r\nindividual. There could be no doubt as to the ownership of the product,\r\nas he produced it by his own labour, with materials and tools that\r\nbelonged to himself. Such was the normal method of production in those\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nIt is very different in the existing system. The most conspicuous result\r\nof the capitalistic system is, that production is a social operation\r\ncarried on by men organised and associated in factories; but the product\r\nis appropriated by individual capitalists: it is social production and\r\ncapitalistic appropriation. Whereas the property of the preceding era\r\nrested on the individual’s own labour, property under the capitalistic\r\nsystem is the product of other men’s labour. This is the contradiction\r\nwhich runs through the entire history of capitalism. Here we have in\r\ngerm all the antagonism and confusion of the present time. The\r\nincompatibility of social production and capitalistic appropriation must\r\nmore and more declare itself as the supremacy of the system extends over\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nThe contradiction between social production and capitalistic\r\nappropriation naturally appears in the contrast between the human beings\r\nconcerned in it. For the appropriators form the _bourgeoisie_, and the\r\nsocial workers constitute the proletariat, the two historic classes of\r\nthe new era. Another conspicuous and important result is that, while we\r\nhave this organisation in the factory, we have outside of it all the\r\nanarchy of competition. We have the capitalistic appropriators of the\r\nproduct of labour contending for the possession of the market, without\r\nsystematic regard to the supply required by that market—each one\r\nfilling the market only as dictated by his own interest, and trying to\r\noutdo his rivals by all the methods of adulteration, bribery, and\r\nintrigue; an economic war hurtful to the best interests of society. With\r\nthe development of the capitalistic system machinery is more and more\r\nperfected, for to neglect improvement is to succumb in the struggle; the\r\nimproved machinery renders labour superfluous, which is accordingly\r\nthrown idle and exposed to starvation; and this is entirely satisfactory\r\nto the capitalist class, whose interest it is to have a reserve army of\r\nlabourers disposable for the times when industry is specially active,\r\nbut cast out on the streets through the crash that must necessarily\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nBut as the technique improves the productive power of industry\r\nincreases, and continually tends more and more to surpass the available\r\nneeds of the market, wide as it is. This is all the more inevitable,\r\nbecause the consumption of the masses of the population is reduced to\r\nthe minimum requisite merely to maintain them in life. It is another\r\ncontradiction of the capitalistic system that on the one hand its\r\ninherent laws tend to restrict the market which on the other hand it is\r\nready by all means fair and foul to extend. The consequence is, that the\r\nmarket tends to be overstocked even to absolute repletion; goods will\r\nnot sell, and a commercial crisis is established, in which we have the\r\nremarkable phenomenon of widespread panic, misery, and starvation\r\nresulting from a superabundance of wealth—a “crise pléthorique,” as\r\nFourier called it, a crisis due to a plethora of wealth.\r\n\r\nThese crises occur at periodic intervals, each one severer and more\r\nwidespread than the preceding, until they now tend to become chronic and\r\npermanent, and the whole capitalistic world staggers under an atlantean\r\nweight of ill-distributed wealth. Thus the process goes on in obedience\r\nto its own inherent laws. Production is more and more concentrated in\r\nthe hands of mammoth capitalists and colossal joint-stock companies,\r\nunder which the proletariat are organised and drilled into vast\r\nindustrial armies. But as crisis succeeds crisis, until panic,\r\nstagnation, and disorder are universal, it becomes clear that the\r\n_bourgeoisie_ are no longer capable of controlling the industrial world.\r\nIn fact, the productive forces rise in chronic rebellion against the\r\nforms imposed on them by capitalism.\r\n\r\nThe incompatibility between social production and anarchic distribution\r\ndecidedly declares itself. A long course of hard experience has trained\r\nthe modern democracy in the insight necessary for the appreciation of\r\nthe conditions of its own existence. The social character of production\r\nis explicitly recognised. The proletariat seizes the political power,\r\nand through it at last takes complete control over the economic\r\nfunctions of society. It expropriates the private capitalist, and,\r\nappropriating the means of production, manages them in its own interest,\r\nwhich is the interest of society as a whole; society passes into the\r\nsocialistic stage through a revolution determined by the natural laws of\r\nsocial evolution, and not by a merely arbitrary exercise of power. It is\r\na result determined by the inherent laws of social evolution,\r\nindependent of the will and purpose of individual men. All that the most\r\npowerful and clear-sighted intellect can do is to learn to divine the\r\nlaws of the great movement of society, and to shorten and alleviate the\r\nbirth-pangs of the new era. The efforts of reactionaries of every class\r\nto turn the wheel of history backwards are in vain. But an intelligent\r\nappreciation of its tendencies, and a willing co-operation with them,\r\nwill make progress easier, smoother, and more rapid.\r\n\r\nWe need hardly return to the _rôle_ which is played by surplus value in\r\nthis vast historical process. The capitalist appropriates the product of\r\nlabour because it contains surplus value. It is the part of the product\r\nthat embodies surplus value and represents a clear gain which attracts\r\nhim. Surplus value is the beginning, middle, and end of capitalism. It\r\nmoves it alike in its origin and progress, decline and fall. It is the\r\nkeynote of a great process of historic evolution continued for\r\ncenturies; the secret of a vast development, which becomes more and more\r\nopen as time goes on. And capitalism grows sick of the sustenance which\r\nformerly nourished it. It dies of over-repletion, of habitual excess in\r\nsurplus value.\r\n\r\nLet us now inquire how far the Marx school have thrown any light on the\r\nforms likely to be assumed by the new society after the downfall of\r\ncapitalism. In his mature works as far as published Marx himself has\r\nsaid little to guide us. The clearest indication of his views is\r\ncontained in the following passage:—‘Let us assume an association of\r\nfree men, who work with common means of production and consciously put\r\nforth their many individual labour powers as a social labour power. The\r\ntotal product of the association is a social product. A part of this\r\nproduct serves again as means of production. It remains social property.\r\nBut another part is as means of living consumed by the members of the\r\nassociation. It must therefore be distributed among them. The nature of\r\nthis distribution will change according to the special nature of the\r\norganisation of production and the corresponding grade of historical\r\ndevelopment of the producers.’ And then he goes on to assume that the\r\nshare of each producer in the means of living may be determined by his\r\nlabour time. Labour time will at once serve as measure of the share of\r\neach producer in the common labour, and therefore also of his share in\r\nthe portion of the common product which is devoted to consumption.[5]\r\n\r\nAnother important indication by one who has full right to speak for Marx\r\nis contained in Fr. Engels’ views regarding the State. After the\r\nproletariat have seized political power and transformed the means of\r\nproduction into State property, the State will cease to exist. In the\r\nold societies the State was an organisation of the exploiting class for\r\nthe maintenance of the conditions of exploitation that suited it.\r\nOfficially the representatives of the whole society, the exploiting\r\nclass only represented itself. But when the State at last becomes the\r\nreal representative of the whole society it renders itself superfluous.\r\nIn a society which contains no subject class, from which class rule and\r\nthe anarchy of production and the collisions and excesses of the\r\nstruggle for individual existence have been removed, there is nothing to\r\nrepress, and no need for a repressing force like the State. The first\r\nact wherein the State really appears as representative of the entire\r\nsociety—the appropriation of the means of production in the name of\r\nsociety—is also its last independent act as State. In place of the\r\ngovernment over persons, there will be an administration of things and\r\nthe control of productive processes. The State is not abolished; it dies\r\naway.[6]\r\n\r\nIn effect, these two indications of opinion point to a condition of\r\nsociety which is not fundamentally different from that contemplated by\r\nthe anarchist school. Both look forward to a period when men will live\r\nin free associations, and when the administration of social affairs will\r\nbe conducted without the exercise of compulsion.\r\n\r\nIt will have been seen that what Marx and his school contemplate is an\r\neconomic revolution brought about in accordance with the natural laws of\r\nhistoric evolution. But in order to understand the full import of this\r\nrevolution in the mind of Marx, we must remember that he regards the\r\neconomic order of society as the groundwork of the same, determining all\r\nthe other forms of social order. The entire legal and political\r\nstructure, as well as philosophy and religion, are constituted and\r\ncontrolled in accordance with the economic basis. This is in harmony\r\nwith his method and his conception of the world, which is the Hegelian\r\nreversed: ‘For Hegel the thought process, which he transforms into an\r\nindependent subject under the name idea, is the creator of the real,\r\nwhich forms only its external manifestation. With me, on the contrary,\r\nthe ideal is nothing else than the material transformed and translated\r\nin the human brain.’ His conception of the world is a frank and avowed\r\nmaterialism.\r\n\r\nAnd to a world thus understood he applies the dialectic method of\r\ninvestigation. Dialectic is a word current in the Hegelian and other\r\nphilosophies. It sounds rather out of place in a materialistic view of\r\nthe world. In the system of Marx it means that the business of inquiry\r\nis to trace the connection and concatenation in the links that make up\r\nthe process of historic evolution, to investigate how one stage succeeds\r\nanother in the development of society, the facts and forms of human life\r\nand history not being stable and stereotyped things, but the\r\never-changing manifestations of the fluent and unresting real, the\r\ncourse of which it is the duty of science to reveal. Both Marx and Fr.\r\nEngels, moreover, are fond of expressing the development of capitalism\r\nin the language of the well-known Hegelian threefold process—thesis,\r\nantithesis, and synthesis. Private property resting on a man’s own\r\nlabour of the former times is the thesis. The property resting on other\r\nmen’s labour of the capitalistic era is the negation of this individual\r\nproperty. The expropriation of the capitalists by the proletariat is the\r\nnegation of the negation, or synthesis. But how far this use of the\r\nHegelian terms is merely a form of literary expression, or how far it is\r\na survival in Marx of a real belief in Hegelianism, it is not easy to\r\ndetermine.[7]\r\n\r\nThe whole position of the Marx school may be characterised as\r\nevolutionary and revolutionary socialism, based on a materialistic\r\nconception of the world and of human history. Socialism is a social\r\nrevolution determined by the laws of historic evolution—a revolution\r\nwhich, changing the economic groundwork of society, will change the\r\nwhole structure.\r\n\r\nIt may now be convenient to sum up the socialism of the Marx school\r\nunder the following heads:—\r\n\r\n    (1) Materialistic conception of the world and of history.\r\n\r\n    (2) Dialectic method of investigation.\r\n\r\n    (3) The economic order is the basis of all social order; the\r\n    entire legal and political structures of society, religion, and\r\n    philosophy are to be explained in accordance with the economic\r\n    basis.\r\n\r\n    (4) The historic evolution of capitalism; how, from the\r\n    fifteenth century onwards, the capitalist class was developed,\r\n    and how a corresponding proletariat was created.\r\n\r\n    (5) The capitalist class grows by the appropriation and\r\n    accumulation of the surplus value contained in the product of\r\n    labour, whilst the proletariat is reduced to a subsistence wage.\r\n    It is social production and capitalistic appropriation.\r\n\r\n    (6) Organisation in the factory; anarchy in society as a whole.\r\n\r\n    (7) This anarchy is intensified, especially in the great\r\n    commercial crises, showing that the middle class are no longer\r\n    able to control the productive forces.\r\n\r\n    (8) All these contradictions can be solved only by an explicit\r\n    recognition of the social character of production. The\r\n    proletariat seizes political power and transforms the means of\r\n    production into social property.\r\n\r\n    (9) The State, which has hitherto been an arrangement for\r\n    holding the producing class in subjection, will become\r\n    superfluous, and die a natural death. Henceforward, government\r\n    will consist simply in the control of industrial processes.\r\n\r\nThe work of Marx is a natural history of capital, especially in its\r\nrelation to labour, and in its most essential features is a development\r\nof two of the leading principles of the classic economics—that labour\r\nis the source of value, but that of this value the labourer obtains for\r\nhimself merely a subsistence wage, the surplus being appropriated by the\r\nexploiting capitalist. Marx’s great work may be described as an\r\nelaborate historical development of this glaring fundamental\r\ncontradiction of the Ricardian economics, the contradiction between the\r\nIron Law of Wages and the great principle that labour is the source of\r\nwealth. Marx’s conception of labour is the same as that of Ricardo, and\r\nas a logical exposition of the historic contradiction between the two\r\nprinciples, on the basis of Ricardo, the work of Marx is quite\r\nunanswerable. It is obvious, however, that the definition of labour\r\nassumed both in Ricardo and Marx is too narrow. The labour they broadly\r\nposit as the source of wealth is manual labour. In the early stages of\r\nindustry, when the market was small and limited, and the technique was\r\nof the simplest and rudest description, labour in that sense might\r\ncorrectly enough be described as the source of value. But in modern\r\nindustry, when the market is world-wide, the technique most complex, and\r\nthe competition most severe, when inventiveness, sagacity, courage, and\r\ndecision in initiative, and skill in management, are factors so\r\nimportant, no such exclusive place as has been claimed can be assigned\r\nto labour. The Ricardian principle, therefore, falls to the ground.\r\n\r\nAnd it is not historically true to maintain, as Marx does, that the\r\nprofits of the capitalist are obtained simply by appropriating the\r\nproducts of unpaid labour. In initiating and managing, the capitalist is\r\ncharged with the most difficult and important part of the work of\r\nproduction. As a natural consequence, it follows that Marx is also\r\nhistorically inaccurate in roundly explaining capital as the\r\naccumulation of unpaid labour appropriated by the capitalist. In past\r\naccumulation, as in the control and management of industry generally,\r\nthe capitalist has had the leading part. Capital, therefore, is not\r\nnecessarily robbery, and in an economic order in which the system of\r\nfree exchange is the rule and the mutually beneficial interchange of\r\nutilities, no objection can be raised to the principle of lending and\r\nborrowing of money for interest. In short, in his theory of unpaid\r\nlabour as supplying the key to his explanation of the genesis and\r\ndevelopment of the capitalistic system, Marx is not true to history. It\r\nis the perfectly logical outcome of certain of the leading principles of\r\nthe Ricardian school, but it does not give an adequate or accurate\r\naccount of the facts of economic evolution.\r\n\r\nIn his theory of unpaid labour Marx is not consistent with the general\r\nprinciples of his own philosophy of social evolution. With him history\r\nis a process determined by material forces, a succession of orderly\r\nphenomena controlled by natural laws. Now we may waive the objection\r\nsuggested by the principle enunciated in the Marx school itself, that it\r\nis not legitimate to apply ethical categories in judgment on economic\r\nprocesses that are merely natural; which, however, Marx does with\r\nrevolutionary emphasis throughout some hundreds of pages of his great\r\nwork. It is more important to point out, in perfect consistency with the\r\nprinciples of the school, that the energy and inventiveness of the early\r\ncapitalists especially were the most essential factors in determining\r\nthe existence and development of a great economic era, and that the\r\nassertion of freedom was an indispensable condition in breaking the\r\nbonds of the old feudal order, which the new system displaced. Instead,\r\ntherefore, of living and growing rich on the produce of unpaid labour,\r\nthe capitalist had a great social and industrial function to perform,\r\nand played a great part in historic evolution. The position and function\r\nof the workman was subordinate.\r\n\r\nIn short, Marx has not sufficiently recognised the fact that the\r\ndevelopment of the new social forces brought with it a new set of\r\nfunctions: that of initiating and directing industrial enterprise. These\r\nfunctions are not comprehended in the narrow definition of labour, but\r\nthey are, nevertheless, most essential to progress; and the men that\r\nperformed them have a most complete historical reason for their\r\nexistence and a share in the results of industry. We need not add that\r\nsuch an argument does not justify all they did as the heads of the new\r\nindustry. There is ample evidence that they were often rough, hard,\r\ncruel, and unscrupulous in the prosecution of their industrial\r\nenterprises. Nor does it prejudice the question whether the like\r\ndirection of industry must and should continue in the future.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that in his theory of surplus value obtained from\r\nunpaid labour, Marx, as agitator and controversialist, has fallen into\r\nserious contradiction with himself as scientific historian and\r\nphilosopher. The theory that labour is the source of value was widely\r\naccepted among economists during his early life, and by its justice and\r\nnobleness it was well adapted to the comfortable optimism prevalent\r\namong so many of the classical school. The economists, however, did not\r\nfollow the principle to its obvious conclusion: that if labour is the\r\nsource of wealth, the labourer should enjoy it all. It was otherwise\r\nwith the socialists, who were not slow to perceive the bearing of the\r\ntheory on the existing economic order. In his controversial treatise\r\nagainst Proudhon, Marx gives a list of writers (beginning with the\r\npolitical economy of Hopkins,[8] published in 1822, only five years\r\nafter the appearance of Ricardo’s great work), by whom the principle was\r\napplied to revolutionary purposes. Its simplicity and seeming\r\neffectiveness must have made it most attractive. As posited by the\r\nclassic economy, and applied by the socialists, Marx accepted the\r\nprinciple. It was an unanswerable _argumentum ad hominem_ when addressed\r\nto an economist of the Ricardian school; but it should have broken down\r\nwhen confronted with historical fact. Nevertheless it was made, and\r\ncontinued to be, the foundation-stone of the system of Marx, and is\r\nreally its weakest point. His doctrine of surplus value is the vitiating\r\nfactor in his history of the capitalistic system. The most obvious\r\nexcuse for him is that he borrowed it from the classic economists.\r\n\r\nFr. Engels sums up the achievement of his friend Marx in the two great\r\ndiscoveries—the materialistic conception of history, and the revelation\r\nof the secret of the capitalistic method of production by means of\r\nsurplus value. Materialism is a very old theory of the world. It is now\r\ngiven up by competent thinkers, and we need not discuss it here. Nor\r\nneed we say that it is a grave exaggeration to maintain that all social\r\ninstitutions, including philosophy and religion, are to be explained by\r\nreference to the economic factors. History is a record of the activity\r\nof the human mind in very many directions. Men have had various\r\ninterests, which have had a substantive, and so far, an independent\r\nvalue, though they must also be regarded as an organic whole. It is\r\nabsolutely impossible to account for all by reference to any one.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is a great merit of Marx that he has so powerfully\r\ncalled attention to the vast importance of the economic side of history.\r\nThe economic factors in the life of mankind have been sadly neglected,\r\neven by philosophic historians. Such neglect has been partly due to the\r\nscarcity of material relating to this aspect of their subject, partly\r\nowing to false conceptions of the function of the historian, chiefly\r\nbecause their public was a high-bred class, which had no particular wish\r\nto read about such unfashionable topics as those connected with the\r\ndaily toil of the lower orders. In this way the true causation of\r\nhistory has often been overlooked, or totally misconceived, and results\r\nhave, in thousands of instances, been traced to conventional and\r\nimaginary agencies, when the real origin lay deep down in the economic\r\nlife of the people. We are now beginning to see that large sections of\r\nhistory will need to be rewritten in this new light.\r\n\r\nTo proceed with our criticism of Marx. It is a feature of his\r\nmaterialistic conception of history that his language respecting the\r\ninevitable march of society would sometimes suggest a kind of fatalism.\r\nBut this is more than counterbalanced by his strong assertion of the\r\nrevolutionary will. On both sides we see overstatement. The most\r\nprominent feature of his teaching, however, in this reference, is the\r\nexcessive stress which he lays on the virtues and possibilities of the\r\nrevolutionary method of action. The evolution he contemplates is\r\nattended and disturbed by great historic breaks, by cataclysm and\r\ncatastrophe. These and other features of his teaching, to which\r\nobjection must be made, were most pronounced in his early writings,\r\nespecially in the Manifesto of the Communist League, but they continue\r\nto be visible throughout his life. According to his latest teaching, a\r\ngreat revolutionary catastrophe is to close the capitalistic era; and\r\nthis must be regarded as a very bad preparation for the time of social\r\npeace which is forthwith to follow. The proletariat, the class which is\r\nto accomplish the revolution, he described as oppressed, enslaved, and\r\ndegenerate. How can such a class be expected to perform so great an\r\nhistoric function well and successfully?\r\n\r\nBut the main defect of his teaching lies in the arbitrariness and\r\nexcessive abstractness that characterise his method of investigation and\r\npresentation; and this defect particularly attaches to the second great\r\ndiscovery attributed to him by Fr. Engels—his theory of surplus value.\r\n\r\nWe shall better understand the position of Marx if we recall some of the\r\nimportant circumstances in his life and experience. As we have seen, his\r\nfamily passed from the profession of Judaism to Christianity when he was\r\nsix years of age, and he thus lost the traditions of the faith of his\r\nancestors without living into the traditions of the new faith. Like many\r\nJews in a similar position the traditions of the past therefore had\r\nlittle influence on Karl Marx, and he was so far well fitted to take a\r\nwide and unprejudiced view of human affairs. With his great endowments\r\nand vast knowledge he should have been one of the freest heads in\r\nEurope. His practical energy was not inferior to the range of his\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nAll the more regrettable, therefore, is it that Marx should have adopted\r\nsuch a narrowing system of philosophy as materialism. It is also\r\nremarkable that he, the severest of critics, should have adopted, at so\r\nearly an age and without due scrutiny, the theory of value set forth by\r\nAdam Smith and Ricardo, and that he should have applied it without\r\nquestion during the remainder of his life to the building up of a vast\r\nsystem of thought, and to a socialistic propaganda which was meant to\r\nrevolutionise the world. Another instance of the premature dogmatism\r\nwhich has so often exercised a great and not seldom a mischievous\r\ninfluence on human thought.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it may not be altogether fanciful to observe that his\r\nheredity derived from rabbinical ancestors may account for much that is\r\npeculiar in his way of thinking. The excessive acumen, the relentless\r\nminuteness with which he pursues his course through details which often\r\nseem very unreal, the elaboration which he bestows upon distinctions\r\nwhich are often abstract and artificial, may well be regarded as alien\r\nto Western modes of thought. Revolutionary materialism was a strange\r\nsphere in which to exercise a logic after the manner of the rabbi.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, we know that when his mind was being formed the\r\nHegelian philosophy was supreme in Germany; and it can hardly be said\r\nthat the study of Hegel is a good training for the study of history,\r\naccording to the freest and purest conception of the subject. The study\r\nof history, in the highest sense of the word, requires a modest attitude\r\ntowards objective fact which is not easily attained in the philosophy of\r\nthe schools.\r\n\r\nMarx was a German, trained in the school of Hegel; and he passed most of\r\nhis life in laborious seclusion, in exile and revolt against dominant\r\nideas and institutions. Though a materialist, he does not show\r\nsufficient respect for facts, for history. In reading his great work we\r\nfeel that the facts are in chronic rebellion against the formulas to\r\nwhich he seeks to adapt them.\r\n\r\nAdam Smith, the founder of Political Economy, was also academic at the\r\noutset of his life; but he was a Scotsman of a period when the ablest\r\nScotsmen were trained by French clearness and common sense. And he was\r\nnot in revolt, like Marx, but in full sympathy with a cause whose time\r\nhad come, whereas Marx represented a cause which had not yet attained to\r\nany considerable degree of clearness. In learning and philosophic power,\r\nMarx will compare favourably with Adam Smith; but in historic\r\nreasonableness, in respect for fact and reality, Smith is decidedly his\r\nsuperior. In Smith’s great work we see philosophy controlled by fact, by\r\nhistoric knowledge and insight. The work of Marx, in many of its most\r\nimportant sections, is an arbitrary and artificial attempt to force his\r\nformulas on the facts of history. Whether the fault lay in the Hegelian\r\nphilosophy, or in Marx’s use of it, there can be no doubt that its\r\ninfluence has inflicted most serious damage on what might otherwise have\r\nbeen a splendid historical work.\r\n\r\nWe are therefore obliged to say that the historical work of Marx does\r\nnot by any means rise to the highest conception of history. It is\r\ndeficient in the free outlook, in the clear perspective, in the sympathy\r\nand impartiality which should characterise the best historical\r\nachievements. The historical work of Marx is placed at the service of a\r\npowerful and passionate propaganda, and of necessity is disturbed and\r\ntroubled by the function which it is made to serve.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with history we must accept facts and men as we find them.\r\nThe facts are as they are; and the men of history are not ideal men.\r\nLike other men Marx had to work under human limitations. The great task\r\nof his life was to rouse the proletariat of the world to a sense of its\r\nposition, its mission, and destiny, to discover the scientific\r\nconditions under which a new era in the evolution of the human race\r\ncould be inaugurated and carried on by the working classes of all lands.\r\nIt was a mixed task in which science and practice were combined, and in\r\nwhich the purely scientific study of history naturally suffered in the\r\npartnership with a very strenuous revolutionary practice.\r\n\r\nWe need not say that it was not the fault of Marx that he adopted the\r\nrevolutionary career. He was born at a time and in a country where men\r\nof independence and originality of character of necessity became\r\nrevolutionists. In face of the European reaction Marx never made any\r\nconcession or compromise. He never bowed himself in the house of Rimmon.\r\nSeldom in the history of human thought has there been a man who\r\ntravelled right ahead in so straightforward a path, however formidable\r\nthe opposition and however apparently hopeless surrounding circumstances\r\nmight be. Public opinion had no weight with him; neither idle sentiment\r\nnor amiable weaknesses found any place in his strongly-marked\r\nindividuality.\r\n\r\nIn view of such a career spent in the unflinching service of what he\r\nregarded to be truth, and in the greatest of human causes, it would be\r\nmean and disgraceful not to speak of Marx in terms of profound respect.\r\nHis sincerity, his courage, his self-abnegation, his devotion to his\r\ngreat work through long years of privation and obloquy, were heroic. If\r\nhe had followed the broad and well-beaten highway of self-interest,\r\nMarx, with his exceptional endowments both for thought and action, might\r\neasily have risen to a foremost place in the Prussian State. He\r\ndisdained the flesh-pots of despotism and obscurantism so much sought\r\nafter by the average sensual man, and spent forty hard and laborious\r\nyears almost wholly in exile as the scientific champion of the\r\nproletariat. Many men are glad to live an hour of glorious life. Few are\r\nstrong and brave enough to live the life heroic for forty years with the\r\nresolution, the courage, and consistency of Karl Marx.\r\n\r\nIn the combination of learning, philosophic acumen, and literary power,\r\nhe is second to no economic thinker of the nineteenth century. He seems\r\nto have been master of the whole range of economic literature, and\r\nwielded it with a logical skill not less masterly. But his great\r\nstrength lay in his knowledge of the technical and economic development\r\nof modern industry, and in his marvellous insight into the tendencies in\r\nsocial evolution determined by the technical and economic factors.\r\nWhether his theories in this department are right or wrong, they have\r\nsuggested questions that will demand the attention of economic thinkers\r\nfor a long time to come. It is in this department, and not in his theory\r\nof surplus value, that Marx’s significance as a scientific economist is\r\nto be found.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all that may justly be said in criticism of Marx, it\r\nremains, then, that his main achievement consists in the work he has\r\ndone as scientific inquirer into the economic movement of modern times,\r\nas the philosophic historian of the capitalistic era. It is now admitted\r\nby all inquirers worthy of the name that history, including economic\r\nhistory, is a succession of orderly phenomena, that each phase in the\r\nline of succession is marked by facts and tendencies more or less\r\npeculiar to itself, and that laws and principles which we now condemn\r\nhad formerly an historical necessity, justification, and validity. In\r\naccordance with this fundamental principle of historical evolution,\r\narrangements and institutions which were once necessary, and originally\r\nformed a stage in human progress, may gradually develop contradictions\r\nand abuses, and thus become more or less antiquated.\r\n\r\nThe economic, social, and political forms which were the progressive and\r\neven adequate expressions of the life of one era, become hindrances and\r\nfetters to the life of the succeeding times. This, the school of Karl\r\nMarx says, is precisely the condition of the present economic order. The\r\nexisting arrangements of landlord, capitalist, and wage-labourer under\r\nfree competition are burdened with contradiction and abuse. The life of\r\nsociety is being strangled by the forms which once promoted it. They\r\nmaintain that the really vital and powerful tendencies of our time are\r\ntowards a higher and wider form of social and economic\r\norganisation—towards socialism. Here, as we believe, is the central\r\npoint of the whole question. The place of Marx in history will depend on\r\nhow far he has made a permanent contribution towards the settlement of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nDuring his lifetime the opinions of Marx were destined to find\r\nexpression in two movements, which have played a considerable part in\r\nrecent history—the International and the Social Democracy of Germany.\r\nOf the International, Marx was the inspiring and controlling head from\r\nthe beginning; and the German Social Democracy, though originated by\r\nLassalle, before long fell under Marx’s influence. Marx wrote the famous\r\ninaugural address of the International and drew up its statutes,\r\nmaintaining a moderation of tone which contrasted strongly with the\r\noutspoken vigour of the communist manifesto of 1847. But it was not long\r\nbefore the revolutionary socialism which underlay the movement gained\r\nthe upper hand. The International no doubt afforded a splendid\r\nopportunity for the propaganda of Marx. The fortunes of the\r\nInternational and of the German Social Democracy will be sketched in\r\nsubsequent chapters.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[1] Franz Mehring, _Geschichte der Deutschen Sozialdemokratie_, part i.\r\np. 156.\r\n\r\n[2] An English translation of vol. i. by Messrs. Moore and Aveling has\r\nappeared, Engels being editor. There are translations also of vols. ii.\r\nand iii.\r\n\r\n[3] This book of Engels, _Eugen Dühring’s Revolutionising of Science_,\r\nis better known in its much shorter form, _Entwickelung des Sozialismus\r\nvon der Utopie zur Wissenschaft_.

Hodgskin, who in 1825\r\npublished a pamphlet, _Labour defended against the Claims of Capital_,\r\nin which such views are set forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                           THE INTERNATIONAL\r\n\r\nIt is an inevitable outcome of the prevalent historic forces that the\r\nlabour question has become international.\r\n\r\nFrom the dawn of history there has been a widening circle of communities\r\nwith international relations. Civilisation had its earliest seats on the\r\nbanks of the Nile and the Euphrates. The Greeks and Phœnicians carried\r\nit round the shores of the Mediterranean. The Romans received it from\r\nthe Greeks, and, after adding to it a valuable contribution of their\r\nown, handed it on to the nations of Western and Central Europe. The\r\nChristian Church spread over the countries in which the Roman peace\r\nprevailed, but did not confine itself to the limits of the empire.\r\n\r\nAmidst the group of nations who thus participated in the Greco-Roman\r\nculture and in the Christian life, there has always been a special\r\ndegree of international sympathy: ideas and institutions have been\r\nlargely common to them all. Feudalism and the Church, chivalry and the\r\nCrusades, all these were international in their influence.\r\n\r\nThen, as now, great ideas and great movements could not be confined\r\nwithin national barriers. In the expansive and progressive epochs of\r\nhistory, particularly, supreme interests have raised men above the\r\nprejudices of race, and have united them by wider and deeper principles\r\nthan those by which they are separated into nations.\r\n\r\nAt the great religious revolt of the sixteenth century, Germans combined\r\nwith the Swedes and the French against their own countrymen. The\r\nCatholic Church, as its name implies, has always been, and still\r\ncontinues to be, a great international institution.\r\n\r\nThe enlightenment of the eighteenth century had an international\r\ninfluence, and at the French Revolution high concerns of political and\r\nsocial freedom for a time broke through the conventional feelings of\r\npatriotism. Germans, Italians, and even Englishmen, were in many cases\r\nready to receive the boon of a better order of things at the price of\r\nFrench victory over their own countrymen. Only for a time, till the\r\nenthusiasm of the Revolution was made subservient to the selfishness of\r\nthe new France—an instrument for the colossal egotism of a single man.\r\n\r\nIn our time, steam and the electric telegraph have become the bearers of\r\na widening international movement. All the great human interests are\r\ncultivated and pursued on a wider scale than ever—religion, science,\r\nliterature, art.\r\n\r\nCommerce and industry have naturally shared in the general expansion. We\r\nhave only to scan the operations of the great markets and exchanges in\r\nany daily paper as a proof of this. In a small space round the Bank of\r\nEngland, financial transactions are carried on which powerfully affect\r\nthe entire world. Even the very simple breakfast of an ordinary citizen\r\nis a great international function, in which the productions of the most\r\ndiverse countries combine to appease his wants.\r\n\r\nThe methods and appliances of this modern industry have been developed\r\nin England since the middle of the eighteenth century. Not many years\r\nago England was still the supreme, almost the exclusive, representative\r\nof the new industry; now it is becoming the common possession of all\r\ncountries dominated by European culture, and is rapidly gaining ground\r\nin the long-isolated nations of the East. The competition for business\r\namong the capitalists of various countries grows more intense every\r\nyear. Once carried on chiefly or entirely for local needs, production\r\nhas now to work for a market of wide and often incalculable extent.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, we need not be surprised that labour, the\r\nprime factor in industry, has international interests and relations of\r\nthe most serious importance. Its antagonism to capitalism must declare\r\nitself on the international arena. In the competitive struggles of the\r\nlast sixty years, the cheap labour of one nation has not seldom been\r\nthrown into the scale to weigh down the dear labour of another.\r\nIrishmen, Germans, Belgians, and Italians have often rendered unavailing\r\nthe efforts of English and French workmen for a higher standard of\r\nliving. Continuous emigration from Europe depresses American labour. The\r\nChinese and other Eastern races, habituated to a very low standard of\r\nsubsistence, menace the workmen of America and Australia. The great\r\nindustry which is now being established in the East will be a most\r\nserious danger alike to workmen and capitalists in the Western World.\r\n\r\nThe capitalists of most countries have long sought to shield themselves\r\nagainst the consequences of competition by protection, by combinations\r\ntacit or avowed among themselves, of wide and frequently international\r\nmagnitude. In view of the facts that we have indicated, in view of the\r\nexample thus set them, why should not the working men seek to regulate\r\ntheir international interests?\r\n\r\nEfforts towards the international organisation of labour have proceeded\r\nchiefly from men who, banished from their own country by reactionary\r\ngovernments, have carried to other lands the seeds of new thought, and,\r\nmeeting abroad those of like mind and like fate with themselves, have\r\nnaturally planned the overthrow of their common oppressors. The origin\r\nof the famous International Association of Working Men was largely due\r\nto such a group of exiles.\r\n\r\nIn 1836, a number of German exiles at Paris formed themselves into a\r\nsecret society, under the name of the _League of the Just_, the\r\nprinciples of which were communistic.[1] Being involved in a rising at\r\nParis in 1839, they removed to London. Here they met with workmen\r\nbelonging to the nations of Northern Europe, to which German is a common\r\nspeech, and the League naturally began to assume an international\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThis was not the only change which the League underwent. Its members\r\nbegan to understand that their real duty under the present circumstances\r\nwas not conspiracy or the stirring up of revolutionary outbreaks, but\r\npropaganda. The basis of the League had been a sentimental communism,\r\nbased on their motto that ‘all men are brothers.’ From Marx they learned\r\nthat the emancipation of the proletariat must be guided by scientific\r\ninsight into the conditions of its own existence and its own history;\r\nthat their communism must indeed be a revolutionary one, but it must be\r\na revolution in harmony with the inevitable tendencies of social\r\nevolution. The cardinal point in the theory worked out by Marx and now\r\nimpressed upon the League, was the doctrine that the economic conditions\r\ncontrol the entire social structure, therefore the main thing in a\r\nsocial revolution is a change in economic conditions.\r\n\r\nThe group of exiles put themselves into communication with Marx, and a\r\nCongress was held in London in 1847, with the result that the\r\nassociation was reorganised under the name of the Communist League.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the League is very comprehensively stated in the first\r\narticle of its constitution: ‘The aim of the League is the overthrow of\r\nthe _bourgeoisie_, the rule of the proletariat, the abolition of the old\r\nsociety resting on class antagonisms, and the founding of a new society\r\nwithout classes and without private property.’\r\n\r\nMarx and Engels were commissioned by the League to set forth its\r\nprinciples in a manifesto, which, as the manifesto of the communistic\r\nparty, was published shortly before the Revolution of February 1848. We\r\nshall best illustrate the spirit and aim of the treatise by quoting Fr.\r\nEngels’ Preface to the edition of 1883:—\r\n\r\n‘The Preface to the present edition I must, alas! sign alone. Marx, the\r\nman to whom the entire working class of Europe and America owes more\r\nthan any other—Marx rests in the cemetery at Highgate, and the grass\r\nalready begins to grow over his grave. Since his death nothing further\r\ncan be said of a revisal or completion of the manifesto. It is therefore\r\nthe more necessary expressly to make the following statement.\r\n\r\n‘The pervading thought of the manifesto: that the economic production\r\nwith the social organisation of each historical epoch necessarily\r\nresulting therefrom forms the basis for the political and intellectual\r\nhistory of this epoch; that accordingly (since the dissolution of the\r\nprimitive common property in land) the entire history is a history of\r\nclass struggles—struggles between exploited and exploiting, ruled and\r\nruling, classes at different stages of social development; but that this\r\nstruggle has now reached a stage when the exploited and oppressed class\r\n(the proletariat) can no more free itself from the exploiting and\r\noppressing class (the _bourgeoisie_) without at the same time delivering\r\nthe whole of society for ever from exploitation, oppression, and class\r\nstruggles—this pervading thought belongs exclusively and alone to\r\nMarx.’\r\n\r\n‘The history of all society hitherto has been the history of class\r\nstruggles’; such is the keynote of the manifesto. ‘But it is a\r\ndistinguishing feature of the present time that it has simplified class\r\nantagonisms; the entire human society more and more divides itself into\r\ntwo great hostile camps, into two great conflicting classes,\r\n_bourgeoisie_ and proletariat.’ The manifesto is for the most part an\r\nexposition and discussion of these two classes, the historical\r\nconditions under which they have grown up, their mutual relations, past,\r\npresent, and future.\r\n\r\nIt would not be easy to give a brief analysis of the manifesto, nor is\r\nit necessary, as we have, in our chapter on Marx, already given an\r\naccount of the same views in their maturer and more philosophic\r\nexpression. The manifesto is a treatise instinct with the fiery energy\r\nand enthusiasm of a young revolutionary party, and its doctrines are the\r\ndoctrines of Marx in a crude, exaggerated, and violent form. In such a\r\npamphlet, written for propaganda, we must not expect the\r\nself-restraining moderation of statement, the clear perspective, or the\r\nhigh judicial charity which should characterise a sober historical\r\nexposition.\r\n\r\nThe Iron Law of Wages is stated in its hardest and most exaggerated\r\nform. To the charge that they desire to abolish private property, its\r\nauthors reply that individual property, the produce of a man’s own\r\nlabour, is already abolished. What they desire to abolish is the\r\nappropriation of other men’s labour by the capitalist. To the charge\r\nthat they wish to abolish the family, they reply to the _bourgeoisie_\r\nwith a _tu quoque_: ye have already abolished it by the exploitation of\r\nwomen and children in the factories, which has broken up the family\r\nties, through the prevalence of prostitution and the common practice of\r\nadultery. The charge of abolishing patriotism they repudiate in the same\r\nmanner: the workman has no country.\r\n\r\nWe cannot understand the manifesto unless we remember that it was drawn\r\nup by young men living in exile, and that it was written in 1847,\r\nshortly after some of the earliest inquiries into the condition of\r\nlabour both in England and the Continent had revealed facts which ought\r\nto fill every human heart with sorrow and indignation.\r\n\r\nAs the manifesto of the first international combination of workmen, it\r\nhas a special historical importance, and claims special attention. And\r\napart from that, it is one of the most remarkable utterances of the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\n‘The manifesto,’ says Fr. Engels, ‘was sent to the press at London a few\r\nweeks before the February Revolution. Since then it has made the tour of\r\nthe world. It has been translated into almost every tongue, and in the\r\nmost different countries still serves as the guiding-star of the\r\nproletarian movement. The old motto of the League, “All men are\r\nbrethren,” was replaced by the new battle-cry, “Proletarians of all\r\nlands unite,” which openly proclaimed the international character of the\r\nstruggle. Seventeen years later this battle-cry resounded through the\r\nworld as the watchword of the International Working Men’s Association,\r\nand the militant proletariat of all lands has to-day written it on its\r\nbanner.’[2]\r\n\r\nThe Revolution of 1848, as we have already seen,[3] was a rising of the\r\npeople in France, Italy, Germany, Austria, and Hungary against\r\nantiquated political arrangements and institutions. It was partly an\r\ninterruption to the operations of the League, as it was far too weak to\r\nexercise any great influence on the course of events; but it was also an\r\nopportunity, as its members found access to the land of their birth, and\r\nin many parts of Germany formed the most resolute and advanced wing of\r\nthe struggling democracy during that troubled period.\r\n\r\nAfter the triumph of the reaction it became clear that the hope of\r\neffective revolutionary activity had again for a time passed away. A\r\nperiod of unexampled industrial prosperity set in. Capitalism was about\r\nto enter a far wider phase of development than it had yet seen, a fact\r\nwhich abundantly showed that the time was not favourable for an active\r\npropaganda in the interests of the proletariat. When capitalism has\r\nbecome a hindrance to progressive social development, when it is\r\nobviously too weak and narrow a framework for further evolution, only\r\nthen is there hope of successful effort against it. So reasoned Marx and\r\nhis associates. He withdrew, therefore, from the scene of action to his\r\nstudy in London. In 1852 the first international combination of working\r\nmen came to a close. Observers who could not reasonably be considered\r\nsuperficial, thought that the movement had died without hope of\r\nresurrection.\r\n\r\nBut the triumph of reactionary governments in 1849 was not a settlement\r\nof the great questions that had been raised during that period of\r\nrevolution; it was only a postponement of them. Before many years had\r\npassed, the peoples of Europe again began to move uneasily under the\r\nyoke of antiquated political forms. The rising of Italy against Austria\r\nin 1859; the struggle of Prussian Liberals against the Ministry; the\r\nresolve of Bismarck and his Sovereign to have the Prussian army ready\r\nfor action in the way of reconstituting a united Germany on the ruins of\r\nthe old Federation—these were only different symptoms of a fresh\r\nadvance. They were ere long to be followed by similar activity in\r\nFrance, Spain, and Eastern Europe, all proving that the history of\r\nEuropean communities is an organic movement, the reach and potency of\r\nwhich often disturb the forecast of the politician. In the generation\r\nafter 1848 the governments were everywhere constrained to carry out the\r\npolitical programme which the people had drawn out for them during the\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nThe social question may seem to have only a remote connection with the\r\npolitical movements just mentioned, and yet the revival of the social\r\nquestion was but another sign of the new life in Europe, which could not\r\nbe repressed. The founding of the Social Democracy of Germany by\r\nLassalle, and the appearance of the International on a wider and\r\nworthier scale under the auspices of Marx, were a clear proof that the\r\nworking classes of the most advanced countries of Europe now meant to\r\nclaim a better share in the moral and material inheritance of the human\r\nrace. We have now to sketch the growth of the movement, which is\r\nproperly styled the International.\r\n\r\nAppropriately enough, the event which gave the first occasion for the\r\nfounding of the International Association of Working Men was the\r\nInternational Exhibition of London in 1862. The workmen of France sent a\r\ndeputation to visit the Exhibition. This visit had the approval and even\r\npecuniary support of the Emperor; and it was warmly commended by some of\r\nthe leading Parisian journals as a means not only of acquainting the\r\nworkmen with the industrial treasures of the Exhibition, but of removing\r\nfrom the relations of the two countries the old leaven of international\r\ndiscord and jealousy. In the course of their visit the French delegates\r\nwere entertained by some of their English brethren at the Freemasons’\r\nTavern, where views as to the identity of the interests of labour, and\r\nthe necessity for common action in promoting them, were interchanged.\r\n\r\nIn the following year a second deputation of French workmen crossed the\r\nChannel. Napoleon was interested in the Polish insurrection of 1863, and\r\nit was part of his policy to encourage the expression of opinion in\r\nfavour of an intervention in Poland by the Western Powers. At this visit\r\nwishes for the restoration of Poland and for general congresses in the\r\ninterest of labour against capital were expressed. Nothing decisive,\r\nhowever, was done till 1864, when on the 28th September a great public\r\nmeeting of working men of all nations was held in St. Martin’s Hall,\r\nLondon. Professor Beesly presided, and Karl Marx was present. The\r\nmeeting resulted in the appointment of a provisional committee to draw\r\nup the constitution of the new association. This committee consisted of\r\nfifty representatives of different nations, the English forming about\r\nhalf of its number. At the first meeting of the committee the sum of\r\nthree pounds was collected, a humble beginning of the finances of an\r\nassociation which was designed to shake the world.\r\n\r\nThe work of drafting the constitution was first of all undertaken by\r\nMazzini, but the ideas and methods of the Italian patriot were not\r\nsuited to the task of founding an international association of labour.\r\nThe statutes he drew up were adapted to the political conspiracy,\r\nconducted by a strong central authority, in which he had spent his life;\r\nhe was strongly opposed to the antagonism of classes, and his economic\r\nideas were vague. Marx, on the other hand, was in entire sympathy with\r\nthe most advanced labour movement—had indeed already done much to mould\r\nand direct it; to him, therefore, the duty of drawing up a constitution\r\nwas transferred. The inaugural address and the statutes drawn up by him\r\nwere unanimously adopted by the committee.\r\n\r\nIn the inaugural address[4] three points were particularly emphasised.\r\nFirst, Marx contended that, notwithstanding the enormous development of\r\nindustry and of national wealth since 1848, the misery of the masses had\r\nnot diminished. Secondly, the successful struggle for the ten-hours\r\nworking-day meant the break-down of the political economy of the middle\r\nclasses, the competitive operation of supply and demand requiring to be\r\nregulated by social control. Thirdly, the productive association of a\r\nfew daring ‘hands’ had proved that industry on a great scale, and with\r\nall the appliances of modern science, could be carried on without the\r\nexistence of capitalist masters; and that wage-labour, like\r\nslave-labour, was only a transitory form, destined to disappear before\r\nassociated labour, which gives to the workman a diligent hand, a\r\ncheerful spirit, and a joyful heart.\r\n\r\nThe numbers of the workmen gave them the means of success, but it could\r\nbe realised only through union. It was the task of the International to\r\nbring about such an effective union, and for this end the workmen must\r\ntake international politics into their own hands, must watch the\r\ndiplomacy of their Governments, and uphold the simple rules of morality\r\nin the relations of private persons and nations. ‘The struggle for such\r\na policy forms part of the struggle for the emancipation of the working\r\nclass; proletarians of all lands, unite!’\r\n\r\nThe preamble to the statutes contains implicitly the leading principles\r\nof international socialism. The economic subjection of the workmen to\r\nthe appropriator of the instruments of labour—that is, of the sources\r\nof life—is the cause of servitude in all its forms, of social misery,\r\nof mental degradation and political dependence; the economic\r\nemancipation of the working class is the great aim to which every\r\npolitical movement must be subordinated; the emancipation of the working\r\nclass is neither a local nor a national, but a social problem, to be\r\nsolved only by the combined effort of the most advanced nations.\r\n\r\n‘For these reasons the International Association of Working Men has been\r\nfounded. It declares:\r\n\r\n‘That all societies and individuals who adhere to it recognise truth,\r\njustice, and morality as the rule of their conduct towards one another,\r\nand to all men without distinction of colour, faith, or nationality. No\r\nduties without rights; no rights without duties.’\r\n\r\nSuch are the leading ideas of the preamble; we have only to develop\r\nthem, and we have the programme of international socialism. Whatever\r\nopinion we may hold of the truth and practicability of the theories set\r\nforth in it, we must respect the lucid and masterly form in which Marx\r\nhas presented them. It is seldom in the history of the world that\r\ntalents and learning so remarkable have been placed at the service of an\r\nagitation that was so wide and far-reaching.\r\n\r\nThe International Association was founded for the establishment of a\r\ncentre of union and of systematic co-operation between the working-men\r\nsocieties, which follow the same aim—viz. the protection, the progress\r\nand the complete emancipation of the working class. It would be a\r\nmistake to regard its organisation as one of excessive centralisation\r\nand dictatorial authority. It was to be a means of union, a centre of\r\ninformation and initiative, in the interests of labour; but the existing\r\nsocieties which should join it were to retain their organisation intact.\r\n\r\nA General Council, having its seat in London, was appointed. While the\r\npresident, treasurer, and general secretary were to be Englishmen, each\r\nnation was to be represented in the Council by a corresponding\r\nsecretary. The General Council was to summon annual congresses and\r\nexercise an effective control over the affairs of the Association, but\r\nlocal societies were to have free play in all local questions. As a\r\nfurther means of union, it was recommended that the workmen of the\r\nvarious countries should be united in national bodies, represented by\r\nnational central organs, but no independent local society was to be\r\nexcluded from direct correspondence with the General Council. It will be\r\nseen that the arrangements of the Association were so made as to secure\r\nthe efficiency of the central directing power on the one hand, and on\r\nthe other to allow local and national associations a real freedom and\r\nabundant scope for adapting themselves to the peculiar tasks imposed on\r\nthem by their local and national position.\r\n\r\nAs in founding, so in conducting the International, Marx took the\r\nleading part. The proceedings of the various congresses might be\r\ndescribed as a discussion, elucidation, and filling up of the programme\r\nsketched by him in the inaugural address and in the statutes of the\r\nAssociation. Men representing the schools of Proudhon (who died in\r\n1865), of Blanqui, and of Bakunin also exercised considerable influence;\r\nbut the general tendency was in accordance with the views of Marx.\r\n\r\nIt was intended that the first congress for finally arranging the\r\nconstitution of the Association should be held at Brussels in 1865, but\r\nthe Belgian Government forbade the meeting, and the Council had to\r\ncontent itself with a conference in London. The first congress was held\r\nat Geneva in September 1866, sixty delegates being present. Here the\r\nstatutes as drafted by Marx were adopted. Among other resolutions it\r\ndecided on an agitation in favour of the gradual reduction of the\r\nworking day to eight hours, and it recommended a most comprehensive\r\nsystem of education, intellectual and technical, which would raise the\r\nworking people above the level of the higher and middle classes.\r\nSocialistic principles were set forth only in the most general terms.\r\nWith regard to labour the International did not seek to enunciate a\r\ndoctrinaire system, but only to proclaim general principles. They must\r\naim at free co-operation, and for this end the decisive power in the\r\nState must be transferred from capitalists and landlords to the workers.\r\n\r\nThe proposal of the French delegates for the exclusion of the\r\nintellectual proletariat from the Association led to an interesting\r\ndiscussion. Was this proletariat to be reckoned among the workers?\r\nAmbitious talkers and agitators belonging to this class had done much\r\nmischief. On the other hand, their exclusion from socialistic activity\r\nwould have deprived the labourers of the services of most of their\r\ngreatest leaders, and the intellectual proletariat suffered from the\r\npressure of capital quite as much as any other class of workers. The\r\nproposal for their exclusion was rejected.\r\n\r\nThe second congress, held at Lausanne in 1867, made considerable\r\nprogress in the formulating of the socialistic theories. It was resolved\r\nthat the means of transport and communication should become the property\r\nof the State, in order to break the mighty monopoly of the great\r\ncompanies, under which the subjection of labour does violence to human\r\nworth and personal freedom. The congress encouraged co-operative\r\nassociations and efforts for the raising of wages, but emphatically\r\ncalled attention to the danger lest the spread of such associations\r\nshould be found compatible with the existing system, thus resulting in\r\nthe formation of a fourth class, and of an entirely miserable fifth. The\r\nsocial transformation can be radically and definitely accomplished only\r\nby working on the whole of society in thorough accordance with\r\nreciprocity and justice.\r\n\r\nIn the third congress, held at Brussels in September 1868, the\r\nsocialistic principles which had all along been implicitly contained in\r\nthe aims and utterances of the International received most explicit\r\nstatement. Ninety-eight delegates, representing England, France,\r\nGermany, Belgium, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland, assembled at this\r\ncongress. It resolved that mines and forests and the land, as well as\r\nall the means of transport and communication, should become the common\r\nproperty of society or of the democratic State, and that they should by\r\nthe State be handed over to associations of workers, who should utilise\r\nthem under rational and equitable conditions determined by society. It\r\nwas further resolved that the producers could gain possession of the\r\nmachines only through co-operative societies and the organisation of the\r\nmutual credit system, the latter clause being a concession apparently to\r\nthe followers of Proudhon. After proposing a scheme for the better\r\norganising of strikes, the congress returned to the question of\r\neducation, particularly emphasising the fact that an indispensable\r\ncondition towards a thorough system of scientific, professional, and\r\nproductive instruction was the reduction of the hours of labour.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental principle, ‘to labour the full product of labour,’ was\r\nrecognised in the following resolution: ‘Every society founded on\r\ndemocratic principles repudiates all appropriation by capital, whether\r\nin the form of rent, interest, profit, or in any other form or manner\r\nwhatsoever. Labour must have its full right and entire reward.’\r\n\r\nIn view of the struggle imminent between France and Germany, the\r\ncongress made an emphatic declaration, denouncing it as a civil war in\r\nfavour of Russia, and calling upon the workers to resist all war as\r\nsystematic murder. In case of war the congress recommended a universal\r\nstrike. It reckoned on the solidarity of the workers of all lands for\r\nthis strike of the peoples against war.\r\n\r\nAt the Congress of Basel in September 1869, little remained for the\r\nInternational to accomplish in further defining the socialistic\r\nposition. The resolution for transforming land from private to\r\ncollective property was repeated. A proposal to abolish the right of\r\ninheritance failed to obtain a majority, for while thirty-two delegates\r\nvoted for the abolition, twenty-three were against it, and seventeen\r\ndeclined to vote.[5]\r\n\r\nIf we now turn from the congresses of the International to consider the\r\nhistory of its influence in Europe, we shall see that its success was\r\nvery considerable. A conference of delegates of English Trade Unions\r\nwhich met at Sheffield in 1866 most earnestly enjoined the unions to\r\njoin the International; and it repeatedly gave real help to the English\r\ntrade unionists by preventing the importation of cheap labour from the\r\nContinent. It gained a substantial success in the effectual support of\r\nthe bronze-workers at Paris during their lock-out in 1867. At the\r\nbeginning of 1868 one hundred and twenty-two working men’s societies of\r\nSouth Germany, assembled at Nuremberg, declared their adhesion to the\r\nInternational. In 1870 Cameron announced himself as the representative\r\nof 800,000 American workmen who had adopted its principles.\r\n\r\nIt soon spread as far east as Poland and Hungary; it had affiliated\r\nsocieties, with journals devoted to its cause, in every country of\r\nWestern Europe. The leading organs of the European press became more\r\nthan interested in its movements; the _Times_ published four leaders on\r\nthe Brussels Congress. It was supposed to be concerned in all the\r\nrevolutionary movements and agitations of Europe, thus gaining a\r\nworld-historic notoriety as the rallying-point of social overthrow and\r\nruin. Its prestige, however, was always based more on the vast\r\npossibilities of the cause it represented than on its actual power. Its\r\norganisation was loose, its financial resources insignificant; the\r\nContinental unionists joined it more in the hope of borrowing than of\r\ncontributing support.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 the International resolved to meet at the old hearth of the\r\nrevolutionary movement by holding its annual congress in Paris. This\r\nplan was rendered abortive by the Franco-German war. The war, however,\r\nhelped to bring the principles of the Association more prominently\r\nbefore the world. During the Austro-German struggle of 1866 the\r\nInternational had declared its emphatic condemnation of war; and now the\r\naffiliated societies of France and Germany, as well as the General\r\nCouncil at London, uttered a solemn protest against a renewal of the\r\nscourge. Some of its German adherents likewise incurred the wrath of the\r\nauthorities by venturing to protest against the annexation of Alsace and\r\nLorraine.\r\n\r\nAll will agree that it is a happy omen for the future that the democracy\r\nof labour as represented by the International was so prompt and\r\ncourageous in its denunciation of the evils of war. It gives us ground\r\nto hope that as the influence of the democracy prevails in the council\r\nof nations the passion for war may decline. On this high theme no men\r\nhave a better right to speak than the workers, for they have in all ages\r\nborne the heaviest of the burden of privation and suffering imposed on\r\nthe world by the military spirit, and have had the least share in the\r\nmiserable glories which victory may obtain.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the International to the rising of the Commune at Paris\r\nin 1871 is often misunderstood. It is clear that the International, as\r\nsuch, had no part either in originating or conducting the Commune; some\r\nof the French members joined it, but only on their individual\r\nresponsibility. Its complicity after the event is equally clear. After\r\nthe fall of the Commune, Karl Marx, in the name of the General Council,\r\nwrote a long and trenchant manifesto commending it as substantially a\r\ngovernment of the working class, whose measures tended really to advance\r\nthe interests of the working class. ‘The Paris of the workers, with its\r\nCommune, will ever be celebrated as the glorious herald of a new\r\nsociety. Its martyrs will be enshrined in the great heart of the working\r\nclass. History has already nailed its destroyers on the pillory, from\r\nwhich all the prayers of their priests are impotent to deliver them.’[6]\r\n\r\nThe Commune was undoubtedly a rising for the autonomy of Paris,\r\nsupported chiefly by the lower classes. It was a protest against\r\nexcessive centralisation raised by the democracy of Paris, which has\r\nalways been far in advance of the provinces, and which found itself in\r\npossession of arms after the siege of the city by the Germans. But while\r\nit was prominently an assertion of local self-government, it was also a\r\nrevolt against the economic oppression of the moneyed classes. Many of\r\nits measures were what we should call social-radical.\r\n\r\nIn two important points, therefore, the communal rising at Paris had a\r\nvery close affinity with socialism. In the first place, it was a\r\nrevolutionary assertion of the Commune or local unit of self-government\r\nas the cardinal and dominating principle of society over against the\r\nState or central government. That is to say, the Commune was a\r\nvindication of the political form which is necessary for the development\r\nof socialism, the self-governing group of workers. And in the second\r\nplace, the Commune was a rising chiefly of the proletariat, the class of\r\nwhich socialism claims to be the special champion, which in Paris only\r\npartially saw the way of deliverance, but was weary of oppression, and\r\nfull of indignation against the middle-class adventurers that had on the\r\nfall of the Empire seized the central government of France.\r\n\r\nIt would, however, be a mistake to assume for the Commune a clearness\r\nand comprehensiveness of aim which it did not really possess. We should\r\nnot be justified in saying that the Commune had any definite\r\nconsciousness of such an historical mission as has been claimed for it.\r\nThe fearful shock caused by the overwhelming events of the Franco-German\r\nwar had naturally led to wide-spread confusion and uncertainty in the\r\nFrench mind; and those who undertook to direct it, whether in Paris or\r\nelsewhere, had painfully to grope their way towards the renovation of\r\nthe country. At a time when it could hardly be said that France had a\r\nregular government, the Commune seized the opportunity to make a new\r\npolitical departure. The true history of its doings will, we hope, be\r\nwritten after passion and prejudice have sufficiently subsided to admit\r\nof it. The story of its rise and fall was only one phase of a sad series\r\nof troubles and disasters, which happily do not often overtake nations\r\nin so terrible a form.\r\n\r\nFrom this point the decline and fall of the Association must be dated.\r\nThe English trades unions, intent on more practical concerns at home,\r\nnever took a deep interest in its proceedings; the German socialists\r\nwere disunited among themselves, lacking in funds, and hampered by the\r\npolice.\r\n\r\nIt found its worst enemies perhaps in its own household. In 1869,\r\nBakunin, with a following of anarchists, had joined the International,\r\nand from the first found themselves at variance with the majority led by\r\nMarx. It can hardly be maintained that Marx favoured a very strongly\r\ncentralising authority, yet, as his views and methods were naturally\r\nentirely repugnant to the anarchists, a breach was inevitable.\r\n\r\nThe breach came at the Hague Congress in September 1872. Sixty-five\r\ndelegates were present, including Marx himself, who with his followers,\r\nafter animated discussion, expelled the anarchist party, and then\r\nremoved the seat of the General Council to New York. The congress\r\nconcluded with a meeting at Amsterdam, of which the chief feature was a\r\nremarkable speech from Marx. ‘In the eighteenth century,’ he said,\r\n‘kings and potentates used to assemble at the Hague to discuss the\r\ninterests of their dynasties. At the same place we resolved to hold the\r\nassize of labour’—a contrast which with world-historic force did\r\nundoubtedly mark the march of time. ‘He could not deny that there were\r\ncountries, like America, England—and, as far as he knew its\r\ninstitutions, Holland also—where the workmen could attain their goal by\r\npeaceful means; but in most European countries force must be the lever\r\nof revolution, and to force they must appeal when the time came.’ Thus\r\nit was a principle of Marx to prefer peaceful methods where peaceful\r\nmethods are permitted, but resort to force must be made when necessary.\r\nForce also is an economic power. He concluded by expressing his resolve\r\nthat in the future, as in the past, his life would be consecrated to the\r\ntriumph of the social cause.\r\n\r\nThe transfer of the General Council of the Marx International from\r\nLondon to New York was the beginning of the end. It survived just long\r\nenough to hold another congress at Geneva in 1873, and then quietly\r\nexpired. The party of destruction, styling themselves _autonomists_ and\r\nled by Bakunin, had a bloodier history. The programme of this party, as\r\nwe shall see in our chapter on Anarchism, was to overturn all existing\r\ninstitutions, with the view to reconstructing them on a communal basis.\r\nThis it endeavoured to realise by the great communal risings in Southern\r\nSpain in 1873, when its adherents set up their special form of\r\ngovernment at Barcelona, Seville, Cadiz, and Cartagena—at the\r\nlast-mentioned place also seizing on part of the iron-clad fleet of\r\nSpain. The risings were suppressed, not without difficulty, by the\r\nnational troops. The autonomists had a lingering existence till 1879.\r\n\r\nIn its main practical aim, to serve as a common centre for the combined\r\nefforts of working men of all nations towards their universal\r\nemancipation, the International had only a moderate and transitory\r\nsuccess. It was a great idea, for which the times were not ripe. How\r\neffectually organise so many millions of working men, of different\r\ncountries, at different stages of social development—men ignorant of\r\neach other’s language, with little leisure, without funds for travelling\r\nand purposes of propaganda? It was inevitable that some such effort\r\nshould be made; for we need not repeat that labour has international\r\ninterests of vital and supreme importance. And men might have expected\r\nthat the attempt would be renewed. But on the vast scale contemplated by\r\nthe International it was at least premature, and inasmuch as it drew the\r\nattention of the workmen from practical measures to far-distant and\r\nperhaps utopian aims, and engaged them in revolutionary schemes for\r\nwhich the times were not ready, even if they were otherwise desirable,\r\nits influence was not salutary.\r\n\r\nIn a movement so momentous, however, it is important to have taken the\r\nfirst step, and the International took more than the first step. It\r\nproclaimed a great cause in the face of the world—the cause of the poor\r\nman, the cause of the suffering and oppressed millions of labour. As an\r\ninstrument of propaganda, as a proclamation of a great cause with\r\npossibilities of vast and continual growth, it has had a world-historic\r\nsignificance, and teaches lessons from which all governments and all men\r\nmay learn. Its great mission was propaganda, and in that it has\r\nsucceeded marvellously. Largely by means of it, the ideas of Marx and\r\nhis associates are making the tour of the world. The governments most\r\nmenaced by the social revolution, and most antagonistic to its\r\nprinciples, must perforce have regard to the questions raised by the\r\nInternational. It is a movement that will not rest, but will in many\r\nways, and for many a year, claim the attention of the world.\r\n\r\nThough the International was dead, the forces which gave it birth were\r\nstill alive. The principles it proclaimed continued to exercise the\r\nthoughts of men. It had placed before the world a whole group of\r\nproblems for study, for experiment, to be pursued through doubt,\r\nstruggle, and agony, to some kind of wise and beneficial solution, we\r\nfervently hope.\r\n\r\nWe should not be discouraged by the fact that the efforts made for the\r\nsolution of the questions of the world have so often been so hopelessly\r\nincommensurate with the greatness of the task which they attempted.\r\n\r\nIn beginning these high endeavours, men have always been like children\r\ngroping in the dark. Yet the failures of one generation have frequently\r\nshown the way to success in the next. The International attempted the\r\ngreat task of the present epoch of the world in its most difficult form.\r\nWe need not be surprised that its success was partial; and we may with\r\nconfidence expect that the lessons taught by it will prove most helpful\r\nfor the future.\r\n\r\nIn truth the International had only suffered a brief eclipse. The\r\nvarious socialistic societies all over the world continued to be fully\r\nconscious of the international character of the movement in which they\r\nwere engaged. Without a formal organisation they represented the claims\r\nand aspirations of the same class, had common sympathies, and pursued\r\nlike aims. While differing greatly in methods of action, and even in\r\nprinciple, they felt that they belonged to the same stream of historic\r\neffort and tendency.\r\n\r\nThe international movement soon began again to find expression in\r\ncongresses representing the different countries. Such was the congress\r\nat Ghent in 1877, which was not marked by any noteworthy feature.\r\nGreater than any socialist congress previously held were those which\r\nassembled at Paris in 1889, the centenary of the Revolution, on the 14th\r\nof July, the anniversary of the fall of the Bastille. There were two\r\ncongresses, one representing, as far as any difference of principle was\r\nconcerned, the more uncompromising Marx school, the other consisting of\r\ndelegates who are not indisposed to co-operate with other democratic\r\nparties. But the cleavage of principle was by no means definite; the\r\ndifference between the two meetings originated largely in personal\r\nmatters, especially as regards the French socialist parties, which\r\nissued the invitations. The immediate occasion of disagreement related\r\nto the manner of proving the mandates of the members. Both congresses\r\nadvocated an energetic collectivism, while both also urged more\r\npractical measures for the protection of labour, such as Sunday rest, an\r\neight-hours working-day, etc. The Marx congress consisted of 395\r\ndelegates, and the other congress of about six hundred delegates from\r\nthe various countries of the civilised world.\r\n\r\nInternational Congresses followed at Brussels in 1891, at Zürich in\r\n1893, and in London in 1896. Both at Brussels and London there was much\r\ndisorder, caused chiefly by the presence of a considerable number of\r\ndelegates with anarchist sympathies, and proving too clearly that the\r\nInternational of Workers was like the Concert of Europe, not yet ready\r\nto march.\r\n\r\nAfter being alarmed by an International of Workers, the world was\r\nagreeably startled by the project for an International of Governments.\r\nIn 1889 the Swiss Government brought forward a proposal for an\r\nInternational Conference on Labour of the countries most interested in\r\nindustrial competition. The question assumed a new aspect when, early in\r\n1890, the young German Emperor issued rescripts, one of which contained\r\nthe same proposal. Naturally, the matters presented for discussion by\r\nthe Emperor covered only a small part of the ground occupied by the\r\nInternational of Workers. The protection of adult labour, except in\r\nmines, was excluded from the business of the conference. Sunday labour,\r\nthe protection of women, children, and young persons, were the chief\r\nquestions laid before the meeting. There can be no doubt that the\r\nconference gave a much-needed and a beneficial stimulus to legislation\r\nfor the protection of labour in civilised countries, though it by no\r\nmeans realised the sanguine expectations that many formed regarding it.\r\n\r\nThe main result of the conference has been the recognition by the\r\nGovernments of the fact that there are labour questions of vast\r\nimportance, and that these questions have international aspects which\r\ncan no longer be ignored. Let us hope that it may be the beginning of\r\nbetter things. In the course of human improvement we may hope that the\r\nquestion of the needs and rights of labour will ever take a large place\r\nbeside the concerns of war and diplomacy, and that it will eventually\r\nsupersede them. The workers have a growing influence at the elections in\r\ncivilised countries. It is their duty to press their just claims on the\r\nGovernments, and so to bring about that desirable consummation.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[1] _Enthüllungen über den Communisten-Prozess zu Köln_, von Karl Marx,\r\nEinleitung von Fr.

German history is largely a record of\r\ndisunion, and this became chronic at the Reformation, which divided the\r\ncountry between two conflicting forms of religion. The religious\r\nstruggle had its culmination and its catastrophe in the Thirty Years’\r\nWar.\r\n\r\nSeldom, if ever, in the history of the world, has a calamity so awful\r\nbefallen a people so highly endowed and so well fitted to excel in all\r\nthe paths of progress. In every respect—economical, political, and\r\nmoral—Germany in the Thirty Years’ War received wounds from which she\r\nhas hardly recovered even to-day. Division and weakness at home invited\r\ninterference and aggression from abroad. For generations it was the\r\ncorner-stone of French policy to foster the divisions of Germany, and so\r\nto maintain her supremacy in Western Europe.\r\n\r\nThe victories of the Great Frederick, the works of her great\r\nwriters—Lessing, Schiller, and Goethe, and of her great\r\nphilosophers—Kant, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel, and the mighty\r\nstruggles of the War of Liberation in 1813, did much to restore the\r\nnational consciousness of Germany. But the disunion continued, and in\r\nher industrial organisation she was far behind England and France.\r\nFeudalism survived, especially in the regions east of the Elbe, far into\r\nthe nineteenth century. The power-loom was not introduced, even into the\r\nmore progressive Rhine country, till the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe results of the War of Liberation were, for the German people, most\r\ndisappointing. After throwing off the French yoke, citizen and peasant\r\nalike found that the enthusiasm and devotion with which they had spent\r\nblood and treasure had been in vain. The German princes took to\r\nthemselves all the fruits of victory, and the old abuses continued to\r\nflourish under the old _régime_. The only considerable reforms were\r\nthose which had been established in the Rhine country by the hereditary\r\nenemy, the French, and which the German reaction did not venture to\r\nabolish.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances we need not wonder that a profound and brooding\r\ndiscontent began to occupy the best German minds. A Fatherland which was\r\ndisunited at home and weak abroad, princely despotisms which fostered\r\nservility and raised a barrier to progress, backward methods and\r\ninstitutions which were all the more galling when contrasted with the\r\npre-eminence which Germany had attained in literature and\r\nphilosophy—how could any patriot be satisfied with such a wretched\r\ncondition of affairs? Thus it happened that Germany took a leading part\r\nin the revolutionary troubles of 1848. Both at Vienna and Berlin the old\r\n_régime_ was for a time overturned; and a national Parliament met at\r\nFrankfort. But the German reformers were not united; they had no clear\r\naims; and there was little or no material strength behind them. The\r\nreaction had been taken by surprise. But it wielded the organised\r\nmilitary power, and so was able to act whilst the Liberals talked and\r\nproposed. Before the troubled year had come to a close the reaction was\r\ntriumphant both in Vienna and Berlin.\r\n\r\nThen a time of darkness which could be felt, and which apparently was as\r\nhopeless as ever, followed in Germany. Parliaments were dispersed. Many\r\nwho had shared in the struggle were put to death or imprisoned. In 1849\r\nSwitzerland counted within her borders as many as 11,000 German\r\nrefugees, most of whom eventually found a home in America. It appeared\r\nas if only one failure the more had been made in the toilsome march of\r\nhuman progress.\r\n\r\nBut it was not an entire failure. The revolutionary disturbances had at\r\nleast proved that many of the old institutions were untenable, and must\r\nin whole or in part be removed. It was found necessary to make some\r\nconcessions to Liberalism. Much of the old feudalism was set aside.\r\n\r\nAbove all, both in the middle and working class there had arisen a new\r\nspirit which only awaited the opportunity that was sure to come. The\r\nopportunity arrived a few years afterwards, when the forces which have\r\nmade the Germany of to-day came into action. In the new circumstances it\r\nwas an interesting question how far the _bourgeoisie_ and the working\r\nclass could march together. It is a standing charge brought against\r\nGerman Liberalism by the Social Democrats, that it has never led the\r\nprogressive forces against the reaction with any degree of courage or\r\nresolution. They maintain that in the revolutionary struggles of 1848\r\nthe German Liberals never trusted the working class, that when the\r\nchoice came to be made between the reaction and a strenuous democratic\r\npolicy supported by the proletariat, they preferred to transact with the\r\nreaction, and so committed treason on the sacred cause of progress. On\r\nthis question largely turns the history of recent German politics. It is\r\na wide and complicated question which can be rightly answered only by\r\ndue consideration of the facts of the historical situation.\r\n\r\nThe middle class had triumphed both in France and England. But the\r\nindustrial revolution which naturally brings with it the rule of the\r\nmiddle class, was in Germany much later than in France and England. In\r\n1848 the German middle class was still in its infancy, and had neither\r\nthe insight nor the material means to lead the democracy against the\r\nreaction with any prospect of success; nor was it reasonable to expect\r\nthat it should.\r\n\r\nFurther, it may be maintained that the German working class, following\r\nthe example of their French brethren, has been too ready to enter on\r\nrevolutionary courses, and by thus exciting the alarm and suspicion of\r\nall sober-minded men, has done vital injury to the cause of rational and\r\nhopeful progress. There can be no doubt that for those who are bent on\r\nrevolutionary courses, and those who are content with what is usually\r\ncomprehended under the name of liberalism, the parting of the ways must\r\ncome sooner or later. That is no reason why the parting should be\r\npremature. If they can with mutual advantage make their way along a\r\ncommon road against their common enemy, feudalism and the reaction, why\r\nshould they not do so?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for German Liberals and the energetic Democratic party,\r\nthere was no common way. The parting came at the very outset, and it may\r\nbe regarded as inevitable. The chief aim of the Democrats was universal\r\nsuffrage, and for a time at least universal suffrage in Germany, as in\r\nFrance, meant the strengthening of Conservatism. In Germany, as in\r\nFrance, universal suffrage would give the deciding power at the polls to\r\nthe peasantry and the rural population generally which were under the\r\ncontrol of the reaction, and which largely outnumbered the urban\r\npopulation. The German Liberals did not wish universal suffrage, as it\r\nwas not in their interest. They treated the working men and their\r\nleaders with scant courtesy or consideration. They wished to utilise\r\nthem as subordinates, or, at the best, as dependent allies. If the\r\nworkmen were not willing to be thus treated, the Liberals were ready to\r\nshow them the door.\r\n\r\nThe working men were not willing to be so treated, and they turned to\r\nLassalle, with the result which we have already briefly narrated. As\r\ntime went on the gulf between Liberals and Democrats widened, and the\r\ndemocratic working men became Social Democrats. It was a breach which\r\nmay fairly be regarded as extremely hurtful to the sound political\r\ndevelopment of Germany. On one hand it has led to the result that the\r\nGerman middle class has never with resolution and comprehensiveness of\r\npurpose led the democracy along the path on which a really free German\r\nState might have been established. Partly from choice, partly from the\r\nnecessities of its position, the German middle class has followed the\r\npolicy of making for itself the best terms it could with the reaction;\r\nand the socialists say that this meant the sacrifice of democratic\r\nideals to the material interests of the middle class. ‘The treason of\r\nthe _bourgeoisie_,’ ‘the abdication by the _bourgeoisie_’ of its\r\nhistoric place at the head of the democratic movement: these phrases sum\r\nup the worst accusations brought by the Social Democrats against the\r\nGerman middle class.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the working men, finding themselves neglected or\r\nrepudiated by those who, according to the natural laws of historical\r\ndevelopment, should for a time at least have been their leaders, gave\r\near, it may be prematurely, to men of revolutionary views and\r\nantecedents like Lassalle and Karl Marx; and in this manner was formed a\r\nrevolutionary party which in many ways has not had a salutary organic\r\nrelation to the main stream of German life. It is in fact the reaction\r\nwhich has profited by the division between the _bourgeoisie_ and the\r\nworking class.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nWe shall now return to the history of the Universal Working Men’s\r\nAssociation which, as we have seen, was founded by Lassalle in 1863.[1]\r\nAt the death of the founder in 1864 the membership of the Association\r\namounted to 4610, a small number, but we must recollect that it had\r\nexisted for only about fifteen months.\r\n\r\nLassalle, in his will, had recommended as his successor Bernhard Becker,\r\na man totally unqualified for such a difficult post. At the founding of\r\nthe Association it had been thought good that the president should\r\nexercise a species of dictatorship. This arrangement might be suitable\r\nso long as the office was filled by a Lassalle. It was not easy to get a\r\ncompetent man of any kind. In such a novel organisation we need not say\r\nthat there were hardly any members of ability and experience. Lassalle’s\r\nchoice was therefore extremely limited. The most capable of his\r\nadherents undoubtedly was Von Schweitzer, a young man who belonged to a\r\npatrician house of Frankfort on the Main, but his reputation was so far\r\nfrom stainless that the German workmen for some time refused to have\r\nanything to do with him. Becker was elected, and conducted the affairs\r\nof the Association with more energy than wisdom, while the Countess\r\nHatzfeldt, as the intimate friend of Lassalle, used her wealth and\r\nsocial position to control its fortunes in a way little calculated to\r\nsatisfy the self-respecting German working men. It was a time of\r\nconfusion and uncertainty in the Association; of suspicion, jealousy,\r\nand contention among its leading members. There would be no profit,\r\nhowever, in narrating the squabbles which disturbed the progress of the\r\nAssociation in its helpless infancy.\r\n\r\nIndeed, if we consider the matter with some measure of sympathy and\r\nimpartiality, it would hardly have been natural had it been otherwise.\r\nLet us try to realise from what low estate the German working men were\r\nnow endeavouring to rise. We must remember that the German workman had\r\nno share or experience in government, either local or national. The\r\nright of combination, of free speech in a free meeting, and even of free\r\nmovement, had been denied him for generations. He could hardly turn to\r\nthe right hand or the left without coming into collision with the police\r\nand the courts of law. He had no leaders whom he could trust. The German\r\nworking men, it is scarcely an exaggeration to say, had in the sphere of\r\nsocial and political action everything to learn. Under conditions which\r\nwere most trying and uncertain they had to shape out a policy which\r\nsuited their interests and ideals; they had to learn to know each other\r\nand to work in union, and they had to find trustworthy and capable\r\nleaders.\r\n\r\nNameless misery and degradation prevailed in too many of the industrial\r\nregions on the Rhine in Saxony and Silesia. Men, women, and children\r\nwere worked for fifteen hours a day. Hand labour was disappearing with\r\nthe wonted unspeakable suffering before the machinery brought in by the\r\nindustrial revolution. Both the hand labour and the factory labour of\r\nGermany suffered under the pressure of the competition of the more\r\nadvanced mechanical industry of England.\r\n\r\nIn the lot of the German working man there had been neither light,\r\nleading, nor hope. The men who represented State and Church, law and\r\nlearning, and who should have been responsible for his guidance, were\r\ntoo often found among his oppressors.\r\n\r\nIn view of facts like these need we wonder that Lassalle, with all his\r\neloquence and energy, found it difficult to rouse the German working men\r\nout of their apathy and hopelessness? Under such depressing\r\ncircumstances it was no particular disgrace for an ordinary man like\r\nBernhard Becker to fail. Becker’s tenure of the presidency was of short\r\nduration. He was succeeded by Tölcke, a man of ability and energy; but\r\nat his entrance into office the prospects of the Association were not\r\nbright. The funds in its treasury amounted to only six thalers or\r\neighteen shillings. If finance be the test of success the Association\r\nfounded by Lassalle was indeed at a very low ebb.\r\n\r\nThe brightest feature in the early history of the Association was the\r\n_Sozialdemokrat_, a paper founded by Schweitzer at the end of 1864, and\r\nwhich had on its list of contributors the names of Marx and Engels. But\r\neven here the evil fortune of the Association clung to it. In a series\r\nof articles on Bismarck, Schweitzer had given expression to views\r\nregarding that statesman which were highly displeasing to the two\r\nrevolutionists in England, and they publicly renounced all connection\r\nwith the paper. Following Lassalle, Schweitzer had shown his readiness\r\nto join hands with the Conservatives of Prussia when circumstances made\r\nit advisable in the interests of the Social Democracy. Such a policy met\r\nwith no favour in the eyes of Marx and Engels. They demanded from\r\nSchweitzer the same energetic opposition to the feudal and reactionary\r\nparty as he showed to the Progressists. Schweitzer claimed the right to\r\nshape his tactics in accordance with the situation of affairs in\r\nPrussia, which he knew better than men living in exile. A socialist who\r\ncould take a lucid and comprehensive view of the theories which he\r\nprofessed, a man of the world of real insight and tact, Schweitzer, by\r\nhis articles in the _Sozialdemokrat_, rendered effectual service to the\r\nAssociation and to the socialist cause in Germany at a most critical\r\ntime in their history.\r\n\r\nDuring those years the political condition of Germany was most uncertain\r\nand chaotic, and the Association had to grope its way through the\r\ndarkness as best it could. It was a new party composed of members who\r\nhad no experience of common action, and who had with much labour and\r\nperplexity to work out a set of common convictions. Under the\r\ncircumstances a clear line of policy was impossible. The first mighty\r\nstep out of this political chaos was made in 1866, when Bismarck, after\r\ndefeating Austria, established the North German Confederation. The\r\nelections to the North German Diet, which was now established, were\r\nbased on universal suffrage. The first North German Diet met in 1867,\r\nand in the same year Schweitzer was elected president of the Association\r\nfounded by Lassalle. How were the Social Democrats of Germany to relate\r\nthemselves to the new order of things? Before answering this question we\r\nmust say something of important movements which were proceeding on the\r\nSocial Democratic side.\r\n\r\nThe adherents of the Universal Working Men’s Association were drawn\r\nchiefly from Prussia and North Germany. In Saxony and South Germany\r\nthere had meanwhile grown up a new working men’s party, from which\r\nSchweitzer encountered the most strenuous opposition. Under the\r\ninfluence of the new life which prevailed in Germany in the years\r\nfollowing 1860, many workmen’s unions were established. As it was\r\ndangerous to make too open a profession of a political object these\r\nunions adopted the name of workmen’s educative associations\r\n(_Arbeiterbildungsvereine_). Some of these working men’s associations\r\nhad attached themselves to Lassalle, but from the first many had held\r\naloof from him. Many of these associations had been founded and promoted\r\nunder liberal democratic influences, and their aim may generally be\r\ndescribed as political and educational rather than economical; but it\r\nwould be more accurate still to describe them as having no clear aims,\r\nand as on the look-out for a policy rather than possessing one. It is\r\ncertain that as Saxons and South Germans they were to a large degree\r\ninspired by the hatred to the growing ascendency of Prussia which\r\nprevailed around them.\r\n\r\nShortly after the founding of the Lassalle Association a Union of the\r\nworking men’s associations which continued loyal to the Progressist\r\nparty was founded at Frankfort in 1863, and was intended to form a\r\nbulwark against the influence of Lassalle. But this Union of\r\nassociations speedily began to move in the direction of democracy and\r\nthrough democracy to socialism. Two men were chiefly responsible for\r\nthis result, Wilhelm Liebknecht and August Bebel.\r\n\r\nLiebknecht had taken an active part in the revolutionary disturbances in\r\nGermany in 1848, had been a member of the group of exiles that gathered\r\nround Karl Marx in London, and from him had imbibed the principles of\r\ninternational revolutionary socialism. He had joined the Universal\r\nAssociation of Lassalle, but he never enjoyed the entire confidence of\r\nhis chief. Liebknecht counted Luther among his ancestors, and was\r\ndescended from the learned middle class of Germany. His friend, August\r\nBebel, was a working man, who, being left an orphan at an early age, had\r\nbeen educated at charity schools. Brought up to the handicraft of\r\nturner, Bebel continued with the most laudable diligence and\r\nthoroughness to educate himself. By his acquirements, his natural talent\r\nand his force of character, he soon gained considerable influence among\r\nhis comrades. Bebel before long became a force in the German workmen’s\r\nunions.\r\n\r\nAt first Bebel was merely a radical of strong convictions, and he had no\r\nlove for a socialistic agitation like that of Lassalle which was to\r\nadapt itself so much to Prussian nationalism. It was only a question of\r\ntime, however, when a nature so thorough and strenuous would make the\r\ntransition from radicalism to socialism. As the representative man of\r\nthe German workmen’s educative associations, we see him making his way\r\nin a few short years to Social Democracy, and the associations followed\r\nhim step by step. Influential members soon expressed their preference\r\nfor universal suffrage. The Union of associations at its meeting in\r\nStuttgart in 1865 declared for universal suffrage, whilst their organ in\r\nthe same year repudiated the Schulze-Delitzsch schemes in the most\r\nemphatic language. In 1866 a great meeting of workmen’s associations at\r\nChemnitz in Saxony adopted a programme which on its political side was\r\nentirely democratic, and on its economic side made considerable advances\r\ntowards socialism. At its congress in Nuremberg in 1868 the Union by a\r\nlarge majority declared its adhesion to the principles of the\r\nInternational. In a great congress at Eisenach in 1869 they founded the\r\nSocial Democratic Working Men’s Party, and in the same year sent\r\nrepresentatives to the International Congress at Basel. The Union which\r\nhad been designed by the Progressists as a bulwark against Social\r\nDemocracy had proved a roadway by which the workmen marched into the\r\nenemy’s camp.\r\n\r\nThus two socialist parties were established in Germany, the Lassalle\r\nAssociation, which had its membership chiefly in Prussia, and the\r\nEisenach Party, which found support in Saxony and South Germany. Both\r\nparties were represented in the North German Diet, in which at one time\r\nas many as six socialists sat. They now had a tribune from which to\r\naddress the German people, but it cannot be said that they were\r\nparticularly grateful to Bismarck for the opportunity which he had given\r\nthem. To men of the revolutionary party of 1848, whose ideal had been\r\nthe unification of Germany under the free initiative of the people, the\r\nwork of Bismarck could not appear a very delightful consummation, even\r\nthough it was accompanied with the gift of universal suffrage.\r\nSchweitzer regarded the North German Confederation as a very unpleasant\r\nand very unwelcome, but yet irrevocable fact, with which the Social\r\nDemocracy would need to find a way of getting on, on whose basis they\r\nwould have to establish themselves as the extreme opposition if they\r\nwished to continue a political party.\r\n\r\nLiebknecht, on the other hand, looked upon the North German\r\nConfederation as a reactionary work of violence and injustice that must\r\nbe overthrown. In order not to strengthen it he repudiated all practical\r\nparticipation in the legislative measures of the Diet. The parliamentary\r\ntribune was only a platform from which he could hurl his protest against\r\nthe new arrangement of things among the masses of the German people. In\r\nhis opinion the creation of Bismarck meant the division, weakening, and\r\nservitude of Germany, and history would march over its ruins.\r\n\r\nDuring the Franco-German War of 1870-71 the flood of patriotic\r\nenthusiasm for a time almost submerged the socialistic agitation. At the\r\ncommencement of hostilities Liebknecht and Bebel refrained from voting\r\non the question of a war loan; they disapproved alike of the policy of\r\nPrussia and of Bonaparte. The other socialist deputies, including\r\nSchweitzer, voted for it, as the victory of Napoleon would mean the\r\noverthrow of the socialist workmen in France, the supremacy of the\r\nBonapartist soldiery in Europe, and the complete disintegration of\r\nGermany. But after the fall of the French Empire all of them voted\r\nagainst a further loan and recommended the speediest conclusion of peace\r\nwith the Republic, without annexation of French territory. Such views\r\ndid not meet with much acceptance in Germany, either from Government or\r\npeople. Several of the socialist leaders were thrown into prison. At the\r\nfirst election to the German Reichstag in 1871 the socialists counted\r\nonly 102,000 votes, and returned two members.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards Schweitzer announced his intention of retiring from the\r\nleadership of the Universal Working Men’s Association. He had been\r\ndefeated at the general election. His position at the head of the\r\nAssociation, which, as we have seen, was a species of dictatorship, was\r\nno longer tenable. His trials and struggles with the Prussian police and\r\ncourts of justice, the troubles he experienced in the midst of his own\r\nparty, the persecution and calumny which he endured from the opposing\r\nEisenach party, the sacrifice of time and money, of health and quiet,\r\nwhich were inseparable from such a post, had made it a very uneasy one.\r\nHe had conducted the affairs of the Association with a tact, insight,\r\nand appreciation of the situation to which his successors in the\r\nleadership of the German socialists have apparently never been able to\r\nattain. He died in Switzerland in 1875.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, in the spring of 1871, came the tidings of the\r\ngreat rising of the working class in the Commune at Paris. Mass meetings\r\nof German workmen were held in Berlin, Hamburg, Hanover, Dresden,\r\nLeipzic, and other large towns, to express their sympathy with their\r\nFrench brethren in the struggle which they were waging. In the Reichstag\r\nBebel made a speech which contained the following passage:—‘Be assured\r\nthat the entire European proletariat, and all that have a feeling for\r\nfreedom and independence in their heart, have their eyes fixed on Paris.\r\nAnd if Paris is for the present crushed, I remind you that the struggle\r\nin Paris is only a small affair of outposts, that the main conflict in\r\nEurope is still before us, and that ere many decades pass away the\r\nbattle-cry of the Parisian proletariat, war to the palace, peace to the\r\ncottage, death to want and idleness, will be the battle-cry of the\r\nentire European proletariat.’[2]\r\n\r\nWhen the war fever of 1871 subsided the socialistic agitation resumed\r\nits course, and it was fostered by the wild speculations of the time,\r\nand by the industrial crisis which followed it. At the elections of 1874\r\nthe socialist party polled 340,000 votes and returned nine members.\r\n\r\nFrom Lassalle’s first appearance on the scene in 1862, the socialistic\r\nagitation had encountered the German police at every step of its career.\r\nIts leaders were prosecuted and thrown into prison. Meetings were broken\r\nup, newspapers and organisations were suppressed. The free expression of\r\nopinion on the platform and through the press was curtailed in every\r\nway.\r\n\r\nSuch experience taught the socialist leaders the advantage and necessity\r\nof union in face of the common enemy. The retirement of Schweitzer from\r\nthe control of the Lassalle party in 1871 had removed the most serious\r\nobstacle to union. Hasenclever had been elected president in his stead,\r\nbut it was felt that the party had outgrown the autocratic guidance\r\nwhich had been helpful and perhaps necessary to it in its early years.\r\nAll the tendencies and influences of the time served to bring the\r\nLassalle and the Eisenach parties together. They were pursuing the same\r\naims under the same conditions, against the same opposition; and there\r\nwas really nothing now to keep them apart except the recollection of old\r\nrivalries and animosities which soon faded under the pressure of their\r\npractical difficulties.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the process of union was easy, and the fusion\r\nof the Eisenach and Lassalle parties was effected in a congress at Gotha\r\nin 1875. At this congress 25,000 regular members were represented, of\r\nwhom 9000 belonged to the Marx party and 15,000 to that of Lassalle. The\r\nunited body assumed the name of the Socialistic Working Men’s Party of\r\nGermany, and drew up a programme, which, as the most important that till\r\nthat time had been published by any socialistic organisation, deserves\r\nto be given entire.[3]\r\n\r\nThe union of the two parties thus accomplished was the starting-point of\r\na new career of prosperity for the German Social Democracy. At the\r\nelection of 1877 the new party polled nearly half a million votes, and\r\nreturned twelve members to the Reichstag. This result was largely due to\r\nthe admirable organisation to which the socialistic propaganda had now\r\nattained. A staff of skilful, intelligent, and energetic agitators\r\nadvocated the new creed in every town of Germany, and they were\r\nsupported by an effective machinery of newspapers, pamphlets, treatises,\r\nsocial gatherings, and even almanacs, in which the doctrines of\r\nsocialism were suggested, inculcated, and enforced in every available\r\nway. At all the great centres of population—in Berlin, Hamburg, and in\r\nthe industrial towns of Saxony and on the Rhine—the Social Democrats\r\nthreatened to become the strongest party.\r\n\r\nSuch a rate of progress, and the aggressive attitude of the spokesmen of\r\nthe party, naturally awakened the apprehensions of the German rulers.\r\nThey resolved to meet it by special legislation. The Social Democrat\r\nprogramme contained nothing that was absolutely inconsistent with the\r\nidea of a peaceful development out of the existing state. As we have\r\nseen, it is a principle of the Marx socialism that its realisation\r\ndepends on the inherent tendencies of social evolution; but the process\r\ncan be hastened by the intelligent and energetic co-operation of living\r\nmen, and as this co-operation may take the shape of revolutionary force,\r\nand was actually in Germany assuming a most aggressive and menacing\r\nattitude, both on the platform and in the press, it was inevitable that\r\nthe German Government should adopt measures to repress it.\r\n\r\nThe occasion of the anti-socialist legislation was found in the attempts\r\nof Hödel and Nobiling on the Emperor’s life in 1878. It is needless to\r\nsay that neither attempt was authorised by the Social Democratic party.\r\nThe two men had no official connection with the party. Both were weak in\r\ncharacter and intellect. Their feeble brains had been excited by the\r\nsocialistic doctrines which were fermenting around them. No further\r\nresponsibility for their acts attaches to the Social Democratic party,\r\nwhose principles and interests were entirely opposed to such attempts at\r\nassassination.\r\n\r\nThe Bill introduced after the attempt of Hödel was rejected by the\r\nReichstag. On the attempt of Nobiling the Government dissolved the\r\nReichstag and appealed to the country, with the result that a large\r\nmajority favourable to exceptional legislation was returned. At the\r\ngeneral election the socialist vote declined from 493,000 to 437,000.\r\nSevere anti-socialist laws were speedily carried by the new Reichstag.\r\n\r\nA most interesting feature of the discussions which took place in\r\nconnection with the exceptional legislation was the attitude of\r\nBismarck. Now when the great statesman is no more it is specially\r\nnecessary to state that he approached the subject of socialism with an\r\nopen-mindedness which does him honour. He felt it his duty to make\r\nhimself acquainted with all the facts relating to his office, and took\r\nparticular pains to understand the new social and economic problems\r\nwhich were engaging the attention of the country.\r\n\r\nIn a sitting of the Reichstag on September 17, 1878, he did not hesitate\r\nto express his sympathy and even respect for Lassalle. He explained how\r\nhe had met Lassalle three or four times at the request of the latter,\r\nand had not regretted it. Referring to baseless rumours that had been\r\ncirculated to the effect that he had been willing to enter into\r\nnegotiation with the agitator, he stated that their relations could not\r\nhave taken the form of a political transaction, for Lassalle had nothing\r\nto offer him, and there could be no bargain when one of the parties had\r\nnothing to give. ‘But Lassalle had something,’ Bismarck went on to say,\r\n‘that attracted me exceedingly as a private man. He was one of the\r\ncleverest and most amiable men with whom I ever met; a man who was\r\nambitious in great style, and by no means a republican; he had a very\r\nstrongly marked national and monarchical feeling, the idea which he\r\nstrove to realise was the German Empire, and therein we had common\r\nground. Lassalle was ambitious in the grand style; it was doubtful,\r\nperhaps, whether the German Empire should close with the Hohenzollern\r\ndynasty or the dynasty Lassalle, yet his feeling was monarchical through\r\nand through.... Lassalle was an energetic and most intellectual man,\r\nwhose conversation was very instructive; our talks lasted for hours, and\r\nI always regretted when they came to an end.... I should have been glad\r\nto have had a man of such endowments and genius as neighbouring\r\nlandlord.’\r\n\r\nIt should be added also that Bismarck saw no objection in principle to\r\nthe scheme of productive associations with State help recommended by\r\nLassalle. Such experiments were not unreasonable in themselves, and were\r\nentirely consistent with the range of duties recognised by the State as\r\nhe understood them; but the course of political events had not left him\r\nthe necessary leisure. Before leaving this matter we should note that,\r\nas regards universal suffrage and the scheme of productive associations\r\nwith State help, Bismarck and Lassalle had common ground, on which they\r\ncould have co-operated without sacrifice of principle on either side.\r\n\r\nIn his speech in the Reichstag of September 17, 1878, the Chancellor\r\nalso explained the origin of his hostility to the Social Democracy. One\r\nof its leading representatives, either Bebel or Liebknecht, had in open\r\nsitting expressed his sympathy with the Commune at Paris. That reference\r\nto the Commune had been a ray of light on the question; from that time\r\nhe felt entirely convinced that the Social Democracy was an enemy\r\nagainst which the State and society must arm themselves.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, it was Bebel who had used the objectionable language in\r\nthe Reichstag; but Liebknecht had never been backward in the frank and\r\nuncompromising expression of views of a similar nature. Such views were\r\nnot the passing feeling of the hour; they were the statement of firm and\r\nsettled conviction, and may fairly be taken as representative of the\r\nbeliefs and convictions of the German Social Democracy in general. The\r\nSocial Democrats were hostile to the existing order in Germany, and they\r\ndid not hesitate to say so. In these circumstances it is hardly\r\nnecessary to say that a collision with a Government like that directed\r\nby Bismarck was inevitable.\r\n\r\nBismarck himself was a Prussian Junker who had become a great European\r\nstatesman, but in many ways he remained a Junker to the end of his life.\r\nWith rare sagacity and strength of will he had shaped the real forces of\r\nhis time towards the great end of uniting the Fatherland and restoring\r\nit to its fitting place among the nations of Europe. To use his own\r\nwords, he had lifted Germany into the saddle, and his task afterwards\r\nwas to keep her there. The methods, however, by which he had\r\naccomplished the first part of his task, were scarcely so suitable for\r\nthe accomplishment of the second.\r\n\r\nIn the now united Germany he found two enemies which appeared to menace\r\nthe new structure which he had so laboriously reared, the Black\r\nInternational, or the Ultramontane party, and the Red International, or\r\nthe Social Democrats. These enemies he tried to suppress by the\r\nhigh-handed methods which had been familiar to him from his youth. He\r\nwas about fifty-six years of age when the German Empire was established.\r\nIt was too much to expect of human nature that he should at so late a\r\ntime of life break away from his antecedents as Prussian Junker and\r\nstatesman, and adopt the methods which would make Germany a free as well\r\nas a united State.\r\n\r\nYet it is only right to say that he went a considerable distance on this\r\ndesirable path. Both as realist statesman and as patriot he wished to\r\nhave the German people on his side. When he attempted to suppress the\r\nSocial Democracy by methods which are not worthy of a free and\r\nenlightened nation, he did so in all seriousness, as a German patriot.\r\nHe was a man working under the human limitations of his birth,\r\nantecedents, and position. On the other hand, the Social Democrats had\r\nendured oppression for many generations from the classes which Bismarck\r\nrepresented. They had now risen in anger out of the lower depths of\r\nsociety as an organised party, demanding that the hereditary oppression\r\nshould cease. Considered in this aspect the anti-socialist legislation\r\nof Bismarck was only a new phase in a secular process. Time has not yet\r\nfully revealed the means by which a process of this kind can be brought\r\nto a close.\r\n\r\nThe anti-socialist laws came into force in October 1878. Socialist\r\nnewspapers and meetings were at once suppressed, and the organisation of\r\nthe party was broken up. Generally, it may be said that during the\r\noperation of the laws the only place in Germany in which the right of\r\nfree speech could be exercised by the socialists was the tribune of the\r\nReichstag, and the only organisation permitted to them was that formed\r\nby the representatives of the party in the Reichstag. As time went on\r\nthe minor state of siege was established in Berlin, Hamburg, Leipzig,\r\nand other towns, and the police did not hesitate to exercise the power\r\nthereby put into their hands of expelling Social Democratic agitators\r\nand others who might be objectionable to them.\r\n\r\nFor some time confusion, and to some extent dismay, prevailed among the\r\nSocial Democrats. But ere long they found that their union and their\r\npower did not depend on any formal organisation. As Marx had taught, the\r\norganisation of the factory necessarily brings with it the organisation\r\nof the proletariat. A well-drilled working class is a natural and\r\ninevitable result of modern industrial evolution, which no _fiat_ of the\r\nlaw can disturb, if the workmen have the intelligence to understand\r\ntheir position and mission. Thus the German workman realised that the\r\nunion in which he trusted was beyond the reach of repressive laws,\r\nhowever cunningly devised and however brutally exercised.\r\n\r\nThe want of an organ, however, was greatly felt, and accordingly, in\r\nSeptember 1879, the _Socialdemocrat, International Organ of the\r\nSocialdemocracy of German Tongue_, was founded at Zürich. From 1880 it\r\nwas edited by Eduard Bernstein with real ability and conscientious\r\nthoroughness. Every week thousands of copies were despatched to Germany,\r\nand, in spite of all the efforts of the police, were distributed among\r\nthe Social Democrats in the Fatherland. In 1888 it was removed to\r\nLondon, whence it was issued till the repeal of the anti-socialist laws\r\nin 1890.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of Bismarck against socialism apparently had a temporary\r\nsuccess, for in 1881, the first election after the passing of the laws,\r\nthe voting power of the party sank to about 312,000. But it was only\r\ntemporary, and probably it was more apparent than real. The elections in\r\n1884 showed a marked increase to 549,000, and in 1887 to 763,000. These\r\nsymptoms of growth, however, were vastly exceeded by the results of the\r\npoll in 1890, when the number of Social Democratic votes swelled to\r\n1,427,000. They were now the strongest single party of the Empire.\r\n\r\nIn all the large towns of the Empire, and especially in the largest of\r\nall, such as Berlin, Hamburg, and Leipzig, where the minor state of\r\nsiege had been proclaimed, the socialists could show an enormous\r\nincrease of votes. Till about 1885 the Social Democrats had, by their\r\nown confession, made very little progress in country districts, or among\r\nthe Catholic population either of town or country. At the election of\r\n1890 there was evidence of a very considerable advance in both quarters.\r\nThe election sounded the knell of Bismarck’s system of repression, and\r\nthe anti-socialist laws were not renewed.\r\n\r\nThe Social Democrats thus came out of the struggle against Bismarck with\r\na voting power three times as great as it had been when the\r\nanti-socialist laws were passed. The struggle had proved the\r\nextraordinary vitality of the movement. The Social Democrats had shown a\r\npatience, resolution, discipline, and, in the absence of any formal\r\norganisation, a real and effective organisation of mind and purpose\r\nwhich are unexampled in the annals of the labour movement since the\r\nbeginning of human society. They had made a steady and unflinching\r\nresistance to the most powerful statesman since the first Napoleon, who\r\nwielded all the resources of a great modern State, and who was supported\r\nby a press that used every available means to discredit the movement;\r\nand, as a party, they had never been provoked to acts of violence. In\r\nfact, they had given proof of all the high qualities which fit men and\r\nparties to play a great _rôle_ in history. The Social Democratic\r\nmovement in Germany is one of the most notable phenomena of our time.\r\n\r\nAfter the anti-social legislation had ceased the Social Democratic party\r\nfound that its first task was to set its house in order. At a party\r\nmeeting at Halle in 1890 an organisation of the simplest kind was\r\nadopted. The annual meeting forms the highest representative body of the\r\nparty. The party direction was to consist of two chairmen, two\r\nsecretaries, one treasurer, and also of two assessors chosen by a Board\r\nof Control of seven members. The _Sozialdemokrat_, which, as we have\r\nseen, had for some time been published in London, was discontinued, and\r\nthe _Vorwärts_ of Berlin was appointed the central organ of the party.\r\n\r\nIn 1891, at the party meeting at Erfurt, a new programme, superseding\r\nthat of Gotha, was adopted; and as it may fairly be regarded as the most\r\ndeveloped expression of the Social Democratic principles yet put forth\r\nby any body of working men, we give it here entire for the perusal and\r\nstudy of our readers.[4]\r\n\r\n‘The economic development of the _bourgeois_ society leads by a\r\nnecessity of nature to the downfall of the small production, the basis\r\nof which is the private property of the workman in his means of\r\nproduction. It separates the workman from his means of production, and\r\ntransforms him into a proletarian without property, whilst the means of\r\nproduction become the monopoly of a comparatively small number of\r\ncapitalists and great landowners.\r\n\r\n‘This monopolising of the means of production is accompanied by the\r\nsupplanting of the scattered small production through the colossal great\r\nproduction, by the development of the tool into the machine, and by\r\ngigantic increase of the productivity of human labour. But all\r\nadvantages of this transformation are monopolised by the capitalists and\r\ngreat landowners. For the proletariat and the sinking intermediate\r\ngrades—small tradesmen and peasant proprietors—it means increasing\r\ninsecurity of their existence, increase of misery, of oppression, of\r\nservitude, degradation, and exploitation.\r\n\r\n‘Ever greater grows the number of the proletarians, ever larger the army\r\nof superfluous workmen, ever wider the chasm between exploiters and\r\nexploited, ever bitterer the class struggle between _bourgeoisie_ and\r\nproletariat, which divides modern society into two hostile camps, and is\r\nthe common characteristic of all industrial lands.\r\n\r\n‘The gulf between rich and poor is further widened through the crises\r\nwhich naturally arise out of the capitalistic method of production,\r\nwhich always become more sweeping and destructive, which render the\r\ngeneral insecurity the normal condition of society, and prove that the\r\nproductive forces have outgrown the existing society, that private\r\nproperty in the means of production is incompatible with their rational\r\napplication and full development.\r\n\r\n‘Private property in the instruments of production, which in former\r\ntimes was the means of assuring to the producer the property in his own\r\nproduct, has now become the means of expropriating peasant proprietors,\r\nhand-workers, and small dealers, and of placing the non-workers,\r\ncapitalists, and great landowners in the possession of the product of\r\nthe workmen. Only the conversion of the capitalistic private property in\r\nthe means of production—land, mines, raw material, tools, machines,\r\nmeans of communication—into social property, and the transformation of\r\nthe production of wares into socialistic production, carried on for and\r\nthrough society, can bring it about that the great production and the\r\ncontinually increasing productivity of social labour may become for the\r\nhitherto exploited classes, instead of a source of misery and\r\noppression, a source of the highest welfare and of all-sided harmonious\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n‘This social transformation means the emancipation, not merely of the\r\nproletariat, but of the entire human race which suffers under the\r\npresent conditions. But it can only be the work of the labouring class,\r\nbecause all other classes, in spite of their mutually conflicting\r\ninterests, stand on the ground of private property in the means of\r\nproduction, and have as their common aim the maintenance of the bases of\r\nthe existing society.\r\n\r\n‘The struggle of the working class against capitalistic exploitation is\r\nof necessity a political struggle. The working class cannot conduct its\r\neconomic struggle, and cannot develop its economic organisation, without\r\npolitical rights. It cannot effect the change of the means of production\r\ninto the possession of the collective society without coming into\r\npossession of political power.\r\n\r\n‘To shape this struggle of the working class into a conscious and united\r\none, and to point out to it its inevitable goal, this is the task of the\r\nSocial Democratic party.\r\n\r\n‘In all lands where the capitalistic method of production prevails, the\r\ninterests of the working classes are alike. With the extension of the\r\nworld commerce and of the production for the world market, the condition\r\nof the workmen of every single land always grows more dependent on the\r\ncondition of the workmen in other lands. The emancipation of the working\r\nclass is therefore a task in which the workers of all civilised\r\ncountries are equally interested. Recognising this the Social Democratic\r\nparty of Germany feels and declares itself at one with the\r\nclass-conscious workers of all other countries.\r\n\r\n‘The Social Democratic party of Germany therefore contends, not for new\r\nclass privileges and exclusive rights, but for the abolition of class\r\nrule and of classes themselves, and for equal rights and equal duties of\r\nall without distinction of sex and descent. Proceeding from these views\r\nit struggles in the present society, not only against exploitation and\r\noppression of the wage-workers, but against every kind of exploitation\r\nand oppression, whether directed against class, party, sex, or race.\r\n\r\n‘Proceeding from these principles the Social Democratic party of Germany\r\nnow demands—\r\n\r\n‘1. Universal, equal, and direct suffrage, with vote by ballot, for all\r\nmen and women of the Empire over twenty years of age. Proportional\r\nelectoral system; and, till the introduction of this, legal\r\nredistribution of seats after every census. Biennial legislative\r\nperiods. Elections to take place on a legal day of rest. Payment of\r\nrepresentatives. Abolition of all limitation of political rights, except\r\nin the case of disfranchisement.\r\n\r\n‘2. Direct legislation through the people, by means of the right of\r\nproposal and rejection. Self-government of the people in Empire, State,\r\nProvince, and Commune. Officials to be elected by the people;\r\nresponsibility of officials. Yearly granting of taxes.\r\n\r\n‘3. Training in universal military duty. A people’s army in place of the\r\nstanding armies, decision on peace and war by the representatives of the\r\npeople. Settlement of all international differences by arbitration.\r\n\r\n‘4. Abolition of all laws which restrict or suppress the free expression\r\nof opinion and the right of union and meeting.\r\n\r\n‘5. Abolition of all laws which, in public or private matters, place\r\nwomen at a disadvantage as compared with men.\r\n\r\n‘6. Religion declared to be a private matter. No public funds to be\r\napplied to ecclesiastical and religious purposes. Ecclesiastical and\r\nreligious bodies are to be regarded as private associations which manage\r\ntheir own affairs in a perfectly independent manner.\r\n\r\n‘7. Secularisation of the school. Obligatory attendance at the public\r\npeople’s schools. Education, the appliances of learning, and maintenance\r\nfree in the public people’s schools, as also in the higher educational\r\ninstitutions for those scholars, both male and female, who, by reason of\r\ntheir talents, are thought to be suited for further instruction.\r\n\r\n‘8. Administration of justice and legal advice to be free. Justice to be\r\nadministered by judges chosen by the people. Appeal in criminal cases.\r\nCompensation for those who are innocently accused, imprisoned, and\r\ncondemned. Abolition of capital punishment.\r\n\r\n‘9. Medical treatment, including midwifery and the means of healing, to\r\nbe free. Free burial.\r\n\r\n‘10. Progressive income and property taxes to meet all public\r\nexpenditure, so far as these are to be covered by taxation. Duty of\r\nmaking one’s own return of income and property. Succession duty to be\r\ngraduated according to amount and relationship. Abolition of all\r\nindirect taxes, customs, and other financial measures which sacrifice\r\nthe collective interest to the interests of a privileged minority.\r\n\r\n‘For the protection of the working class the Social Democratic party of\r\nGermany demands—\r\n\r\n‘1. An effective national and international protective legislation for\r\nworkmen on the following bases:—\r\n\r\n‘(_a_) Fixing of a normal working day of not more than eight hours.\r\n\r\n‘(_b_) Prohibition of money-making labour of children under fourteen\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n‘(_c_) Prohibition of night work, except for those branches of industry\r\nwhich from their nature, owing to technical reasons or reasons of public\r\nwelfare, require night work.\r\n\r\n‘(_d_) An unbroken period of rest of at least thirty-six hours in every\r\nweek for every worker.\r\n\r\n‘(_e_) Prohibition of the truck system.\r\n\r\n‘2. Supervision of all industrial establishments, investigation and\r\nregulation of the conditions of labour in town and country by an\r\nimperial labour department, district labour offices, and labour\r\nchambers. A thorough system of industrial hygiene.\r\n\r\n‘3. Agricultural labourers and servants to be placed on the same footing\r\nas industrial workers; abolition of servants’ regulations.\r\n\r\n‘4. The right of combination to be placed on a sure footing.\r\n\r\n‘5. Undertaking of the entire working men’s insurance by the Empire,\r\nwith effective co-operation of the workmen in its administration.’\r\n\r\nIf we consider the above programme we shall see that collectivism is set\r\nforth as the goal of a long process of historical evolution. But this\r\ngoal is to be attained by the conscious, intelligent, and organised\r\naction of the working class of Germany in co-operation with the working\r\nclasses of other lands. This is the twofold theme of the first part of\r\nthe programme. The second part is a detailed statement of the\r\nsocial-political arrangements and institutions, by which on and from the\r\nbasis of the existing society the German Social Democracy may move\r\ntowards the goal. The goal, collectivism, is therefore the central point\r\nof the programme.\r\n\r\nThe programme, it will be observed, is a lengthy one about which many\r\ntreatises might be written, and indeed it sums up a world of thought, on\r\nwhich the Social Democratic mind has been exercised for more than a\r\ngeneration. It will be seen that the materialistic conception of history\r\nand the theory of surplus value of Marx are not expressed in the\r\nprogramme, though they _may_ be taken as underlying it by those who\r\nemphasise those two leading principles of Marx. The Social Democracy of\r\nGermany, therefore, is not committed to the special theories of Marx to\r\nthe extent that is commonly supposed, though the general lines on which\r\nthe programme is constructed owe their elucidation greatly more to him\r\nthan to any other man. The various points of the programme will, we may\r\nbe assured, be subjects of discussion and of education for the\r\nindustrious and intelligent working class of Germany for many a year to\r\ncome. It embodies their thoughts and interests, their aspirations and\r\nideals, in the social economic and political sphere, but it represents\r\nno fixed system of dogma. It is meant to be a living creed, mirroring a\r\nliving movement.\r\n\r\nWe have thus briefly sketched the rise of the German Social Democratic\r\nparty from 1863 to 1890. It is a short period, but full of change and\r\ntrouble. The party has come victoriously through a very hard school. We\r\nhave seen how low and feeble were the beginnings of the party. We have\r\nseen also how hard at every step of its career has been its experience\r\nof the German police. Indeed the Prussian and German executive has left\r\nno means untried to suppress and destroy the movement.\r\n\r\nLooking back on the development of the party we cannot doubt that at\r\ncertain decisive stages greater wisdom and insight might have been shown\r\nby its leaders. The ascendency of Prussia should have been recognised as\r\nan inevitable fact which unquestionably made for progress in the\r\nunification of Germany. In this aspect at least the work of Bismarck was\r\nprofoundly progressive. We may safely assume that the unification and\r\nregeneration of Germany would never have been accomplished by a talking\r\napparatus like the Frankfort Parliament of 1848; and we can see no other\r\nforce that could have succeeded except the military power of Prussia.\r\nAnd we may further add that the present policy of the Social Democratic\r\nparty in refusing to vote for the budgets, if it were seriously to\r\nweaken the German executive, would in the existing state of Europe be\r\ndisastrous in the last degree. That men like Liebknecht should hate the\r\nJunker party as the hereditary oppressors of the poor was natural; but\r\nthe Junkers have had and still have a great historic function as the\r\nheads of the forces political and military which have again made Germany\r\na nation. Their way of making the new Germany has not been the ideal\r\nway, let us say; but it has been the way of fact, and no exercise of\r\nrevolutionary impatience of Marx or Liebknecht has been able to arrest\r\nor reverse the fact.\r\n\r\nTrained in the school of adversity, the German Social Democratic party\r\nhas been obliged to learn circumspection and to acquire all the virtues\r\nof discipline, patience, sobriety, and self-control. Some of its\r\nmembers, among whom Most and Hasselman were prominent, strongly urged a\r\npolicy of anarchic resistance to authority, but this tendency was\r\nstrenuously opposed by the vast majority. Most and Hasselman, on\r\nrefusing to submit to the party discipline, were eventually expelled.\r\nEvery attempt to encourage the theory or practice of anarchism in the\r\nGerman Social Democratic party has been sternly and almost unanimously\r\nsuppressed by the party. It succeeded only to a slight degree in cases\r\nwhere it was promoted by the agents of the German police for their own\r\nevil ends.\r\n\r\nA most wholesome effect of the adverse experience of the Social\r\nDemocratic party was that it sifted from their ranks all who were not\r\nthoroughly in earnest in the cause of the working man. It is a grave\r\nmisfortune of new movements like socialism that it attracts from the\r\nmiddle and upper classes all manner of faddists and crotchety\r\nenthusiasts and adventurers, vapid and futile talkers, acrid and morbid\r\npessimists, who join the movement, not from real love of the cause, but\r\nbecause it gives them an opportunity to scheme and harangue, and to lash\r\nout at the vices of the existing society. From this dangerous class the\r\nGerman Social Democratic party was saved by the anti-socialist\r\nlegislation at a time when socialism was becoming fashionable.\r\n\r\nIt is a most significant feature in the development of the German Social\r\nDemocracy that it has attained to its present advanced position without\r\nthe help of any leader of commanding talent. It has had many loyal\r\nchiefs. For over fifty years, during which exile, privation,\r\ndiscouragement, prosecution, and imprisonment were followed by a season\r\nof comparative triumph, Liebknecht was at all times the consistent and\r\nunflinching champion of the revolutionary cause. Bebel’s service for the\r\nworking man now extends to about forty years, and has been not less\r\nconsistent and courageous. Many others, such as Hasenclever, Auer, and\r\nVollmar, have served with ability for many years. But none of those\r\nnamed can be considered men of remarkable gifts. Bernstein and Kautsky,\r\nwho may be described as the leading theorists of the party in recent\r\nyears, have shown wide knowledge, judgment, and clearness of vision, but\r\nthey would be the last to lay claim to the endowments that give Marx and\r\nLassalle their high place in the history of the working class. These\r\nthings being so, we must regard the German Social Democracy as a\r\nmovement which owes its rise no doubt to the initiative of two men of\r\noriginal force, but which in its development finds its basis in the\r\nminds and hearts of the proletariat of the Fatherland.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of other guidance the Social Democratic party has been a\r\ncentre and a rallying-point to the German workmen. While all else was\r\nuncertain, dark, and hostile, the party could be relied upon to give\r\nfriendly and disinterested counsel. The strikes which from time to time\r\nbroke out among the German workmen received the most careful advice and\r\nconsideration from the Social-Democratic leaders, and those leaders soon\r\nfound that the strikes were the most impressive object-lessons in\r\narousing the class-consciousness of the workmen. Whole masses of the\r\nworking men went over to the Social Democracy under the severe practical\r\nteaching of the strike.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the German Social Democracy has therefore called forth the\r\nmost entire devotion among all ranks of its members. When Liebknecht and\r\nBebel were condemned to two years’ imprisonment in a fortress after the\r\ngreat trial at Leipzig, in 1872, they were glad, they said, to do their\r\ntwo years because of the splendid opportunity it had given them for\r\nsocialistic propaganda in the face of Germany. During the fortnight the\r\ntrial had lasted they had in the course of their defence been able to\r\ndispel prejudices and misunderstandings, and so to educate German\r\nopinion in socialism.\r\n\r\nBut the 10th of March 1878 saw a demonstration which of all the events\r\nand incidents in the history of the German Social Democracy may well be\r\nregarded as the most deeply significant. It was the funeral of August\r\nHeinsch. August Heinsch was a simple workman, a compositor; but he had\r\ndeserved well of the proletariat by organising its electoral victories\r\nin Berlin. He had died of consumption, called by the socialists the\r\nproletarian malady, because it is so frequently due to the insanitary\r\nconditions under which work is carried on. In the case of August Heinsch\r\nthe malady was at least aggravated by his self-sacrificing exertions in\r\nthe common cause, and the workmen of Berlin resolved to honour his\r\nmemory by a solemn and imposing demonstration. As the body was borne to\r\nthe cemetery through the working men’s districts in East Berlin, black\r\nflags waved from the roofs and windows, and the vast crowds of people,\r\nreckoned by the hundred thousand, who filled the streets, bared their\r\nheads in respectful sympathy. Many thousands of workmen followed the\r\nbier in serried ranks to the last resting-place.\r\n\r\nOf all the achievements of the German Social Democracy it may be\r\nreckoned the most signal that it has so organised the frugal,\r\nhard-working and law-abiding proletariat of the Fatherland, and has\r\ninspired them with the spirit of intelligent self-sacrifice in their\r\ncommon cause. The programme and principles of the party have received\r\nmodification in the past, and will no doubt receive it in the future,\r\nfor the German Social Democracy is a reality and a movement instinct\r\nwith vitality. The new times will bring new needs, which will require\r\nnew measures. They will bring also, we hope, a wider and clearer vision\r\nand a mellower wisdom, as without wisdom even organised power is of\r\nlittle avail.\r\n\r\nIn view of the loyalty and devotion of the working men, it is all the\r\nmore incumbent on the leaders of the German Social Democratic party that\r\nthey should now guide it along paths which will be wise, practical, and\r\nfruitful. It has too long been their evil fortune or their own\r\ndeliberate choice to stand apart from the main movement of German life.\r\nThey have had little part in the work of State, municipality, or country\r\ncommune. The party began in opposition to the great co-operative\r\nmovement of Germany.\r\n\r\nIt is most important that the theories and ideals of the German Social\r\nDemocratic party should be fairly tested and corrected by their\r\napplication to the practical work of society. The leaders of the party\r\nagree in their preference for legal and peaceful methods. In this point\r\nthey and the representatives of the existing order might find common\r\nground which may form a basis for better relations in the future.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[1] The best authority for the facts connected with the development of\r\nthe German Social Democracy is Franz Mehring’s _Geschichte der Deutschen\r\nSozial-demokratie_.\r\n\r\n[2] See Mehring, _Geschichte_.\r\n\r\n[3] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[4] Our tr. of the programme is taken from the _Protokoll_ or shorthand\r\nreport of the party meeting at Stuttgart, 1898, to which it is prefixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                               ANARCHISM\r\n\r\nIt is agreed that anarchism as a form of socialism originated with\r\nProudhon; but the theory owes its fuller development chiefly to Russian\r\nagitators. The great apostle of the system in its most characteristic\r\nstage was Michael Bakunin.\r\n\r\nBakunin[1] belonged to the highest Russian aristocracy and was born at\r\nTorshok, in the government of Twer, in 1814. In due time he entered the\r\narmy as an officer of artillery, which was a select department of the\r\nservice. While serving in Poland, however, he was so painfully impressed\r\nwith the horrors which he saw exercised under Russian despotic rule,\r\nthat he resigned his commission and entered on a life of study. In 1847\r\nhe visited Paris, and met Proudhon, who had a decisive influence on his\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary movement of 1848 gave the first opportunity for the\r\nactivity of Bakunin as agitator. He was particularly concerned in the\r\nrising at Dresden in 1849. But the hands of the reactionary Governments\r\nand of their police were heavy on the baffled enthusiasts of the\r\nrevolution. Bakunin had a full share of their bitter experience. As he\r\ntells us himself in his work on Mazzini, he was for nearly eight years\r\nconfined in various fortresses of Saxony, Austria, and Russia, and was\r\nthen exiled for life to Siberia. Fortunately, Muravieff, Governor of\r\nSiberia, was a relative, who allowed him considerable freedom and other\r\nindulgences. After four years of exile, Bakunin effected his escape, and\r\nthrough the greatest hardships made his way to California, and thence to\r\nLondon in 1860.\r\n\r\nBakunin thus passed in prison and in exile the dreary years of European\r\nreaction which followed the revolutionary period of 1848. When he\r\nreturned to London he found that the forward movement had again begun.\r\nIt was a time of promise for his own country after the accession of\r\nAlexander II. to the throne. In the _Kolokol_ he assisted Herzen to\r\nrouse his countrymen and prepare them for a new era; but the impatient\r\ntemperament of Bakunin could not be satisfied with the comparatively\r\nmoderate counsels followed by his friend. The latter years of his life\r\nhe spent, chiefly in Switzerland, as the energetic advocate of\r\ninternational anarchism. In 1869 he founded the Social Democratic\r\nAlliance, which, however, dissolved in the same year, and entered the\r\nmain International. He attempted a rising at Lyons in September 1870,\r\nsoon after the fall of the Second Empire, but with no success whatever.\r\n\r\nAt the Hague Congress of the International he was outvoted and expelled\r\nby the Marx party. His activity in later years was much impaired by\r\nill-health. He died at Berne in 1876.\r\n\r\nIn their preface to Bakunin’s work, _God and the State_, his friends\r\nCafiero and Elisée Reclus afford us some interesting glimpses of the\r\npersonality of the agitator. ‘Friends and enemies know that the man was\r\ngreat by his thinking power, his force of will, and his persistent\r\nenergy; they know also what lofty disdain he felt for fortune, rank,\r\nglory, and all the miserable prizes which the majority of men are base\r\nenough to covet. A Russian gentleman belonging to the highest nobility\r\nof the empire, he was one of the first to enter in that proud\r\nassociation of the revolted, who knew to detach themselves from the\r\ntraditions, the prejudices, the interests of race and class—to contemn\r\ntheir own happiness. With them he fought the hard battle of life,\r\naggravated by prison, by exile, by all the dangers, and all the\r\nbitterness which devoted men have to undergo in their troubled\r\nexistence.’\r\n\r\nThey then go on to say how ‘in Russia among the students, in Germany\r\namong the insurgents of Dresden, in Siberia among his brethren in exile,\r\nin America, in England, in France, in Switzerland, in Italy, among men\r\nof goodwill, his direct influence has been considerable. The originality\r\nof his ideas, his picturesque and fiery eloquence, his untiring zeal in\r\npropaganda, supported by the natural majesty of his appearance, and by\r\nhis strong vitality, gained an entrance for him in all the groups of\r\nrevolutionary socialists, and his activity left deep traces even among\r\nthose who, after having welcomed it, rejected it because of differences\r\nin aim or method.’ But it was mainly by the voluminous correspondence\r\nwith the revolutionary world, in which he spent whole nights, that his\r\nactivity was to be explained. His published writings were the smallest\r\npart of his work. His most important treatise, _God and the State_, was\r\nonly a fragment. ‘My life itself is a fragment,’ he said to those who\r\ncriticised his writings.\r\n\r\nNothing can be clearer or more frank and comprehensive in its\r\ndestructiveness than the socialism of Bakunin. It is revolutionary\r\nsocialism based on materialism, and aiming at the destruction of\r\nexternal authority by every available means. He rejects all the ideal\r\nsystems in every name and shape, from the idea of God downwards; and he\r\nrejects every form of external authority, whether emanating from the\r\nwill of a Sovereign or from universal suffrage. ‘The liberty of man,’ he\r\nsays in his _Dieu et l’Etat_, ‘consists solely in this, that he obey the\r\nlaws of Nature, because he has himself recognised them as such, and not\r\nbecause they have been imposed upon him externally by any foreign will\r\nwhatsoever, human or divine, collective or individual.’ In this way will\r\nthe whole problem of freedom be solved: that natural laws be ascertained\r\nby scientific discovery, and the knowledge of them be universally\r\ndiffused among the masses. Natural laws being thus recognised by every\r\nman for himself, he cannot but obey them, for they are the laws also of\r\nhis own nature; and the need for political organisation, administration,\r\nand legislation will at once disappear.\r\n\r\nIt follows that he will not admit of any privileged position or class,\r\nfor ‘it is the peculiarity of privilege and of every privileged position\r\nto kill the intellect and heart of man. The privileged man, whether he\r\nbe privileged politically or economically, is a man depraved in\r\nintellect and heart.’ ‘In a word, we object to all legislation, all\r\nauthority, and all influence, privileged, patented, official and legal,\r\neven when it has proceeded from universal suffrage, convinced that it\r\nmust always turn to the profit of a dominating and exploiting minority,\r\nagainst the interests of the immense majority enslaved.’\r\n\r\nThe following extracts taken from the programme of the International\r\nSocial Democratic Alliance, which he founded, will help to complete our\r\nknowledge of the views of this extraordinary agitator. The Alliance\r\ndeclares itself atheistic; it seeks the abolition of all religions, the\r\ndisplacement of faith by science and of divine justice by human justice,\r\nthe abolition of marriage as a political, religious, legal, and\r\n_bourgeois_ institution. The Alliance demands above all things the\r\ndefinite and complete abolition of classes, and political, economic, and\r\nsocial equality of individuals and sexes, and abolition of inheritance,\r\nso that in the future every man may enjoy a like share in the produce of\r\nlabour; that land and soil, instruments of labour, and all other\r\ncapital, becoming the common property of the whole society, may be used\r\nonly by the workers—that is, by associations of cultivators and\r\nindustrialists. It looks forward to the final solution of the social\r\nquestion through the universal and international solidarity of the\r\nworkers of all countries, and condemns every policy grounded on\r\nso-called patriotism and national jealousy. It demands the universal\r\nfederation of all local associations through the principle of freedom.\r\n\r\nBakunin’s methods of realising his revolutionary programme are suited to\r\nhis principles. He would make all haste to sweep away the political and\r\nsocial institutions that prevent the realisation of his plans for the\r\nfuture. The spirit of destruction reaches its climax in the\r\nRevolutionary Catechism, which has been attributed to Bakunin, but which\r\ncontains extreme statements that do not consist with his acknowledged\r\nwritings. It is at least a product of the school of Bakunin, and as such\r\nis worthy of attention. The spirit of revolution could not further go\r\nthan it does in this document. The revolutionist, as the Catechism would\r\nrecommend him to be, is a consecrated man, who will allow no private\r\ninterests or feelings, and no scruples of religion, patriotism, or\r\nmorality, to turn him aside from his mission, the aim of which is by all\r\navailable means to overturn the existing society. His work is merciless\r\nand universal destruction. The future organisation will doubtless\r\nproceed out of the movement and life of the people, but it is the\r\nconcern of coming generations. In the meantime all that Bakunin enables\r\nus to see as promise of future reconstruction is the free federation of\r\nfree associations—associations of which we find the type in the Russian\r\ncommune.\r\n\r\nThe influence of Bakunin was felt chiefly on the socialist movement in\r\nSouthern Europe. The important risings in Spain in 1873 were due to his\r\nactivity. In the later revolutionary movement of Italy his influence\r\nsuperseded that of Mazzini, for there, as elsewhere, the purely\r\npolitical interest had yielded to the social in the minds of the most\r\nadvanced.\r\n\r\nThe doctrines of Bakunin have also left their mark on the recent social\r\nhistory of France and French Switzerland. About 1879 the anarchist\r\npropaganda showed signs of activity in Lyons and the surrounding\r\nindustrial centres. Some disturbances among the miners at\r\nMontceau-les-Mines in 1882, also provoked the attention of the police\r\nand Government, with the result that sixty-six persons were accused of\r\nbelonging to an international association with anarchist principles. Of\r\nthe accused the most notable was Prince Kropotkine, who, with the\r\neminent French geographer Elisée Reclus and the Russian Lavroff, may be\r\nregarded as the greatest recent exponents of anarchism.\r\n\r\nThere is no more interesting figure in the recent revolutionary history\r\nof Europe than Prince Kropotkine. Like Bakunin, he belongs by birth to\r\nthe highest aristocracy of Russia; his family, it was sometimes said\r\namong his familiar friends, had a better right to the throne of that\r\ncountry than the present dynasty. A man of science of European fame, of\r\nkindly nature and courteous manners, it may seem strange that he should\r\nbe an avowed champion of the most destructive creed now extant. A few of\r\nthe leading facts of his life, as he gave them in his defence at the\r\ntrial at Lyons in 1883, may throw some light on that question.[2]\r\n\r\nHis father was an owner of serfs, and from his childhood he had been\r\nwitness to scenes like those narrated by the American novelist in _Uncle\r\nTom’s Cabin_. The sight of the cruelties suffered by the oppressed class\r\nhad taught him to love them. At sixteen he entered the school of pages\r\nat the Imperial Court, and if he had learned in the cabin to love the\r\npeople, he learned at the Court to detest the great. In the army and the\r\nadministration he saw the hopelessness of expecting reforms from the\r\nreactionary Russian Government. For some time afterwards he had devoted\r\nhimself to scientific work. When the social movement began, Kropotkine\r\njoined it. The demands made by the new party for more liberty met with a\r\nsimple response from the Government: they were thrown into prison, where\r\ntheir treatment was terrible. In the prison where the Prince was\r\ndetained nine lost their reason and eleven committed suicide. He fell\r\nseriously ill, and was carried to the hospital, from which he made his\r\nescape. In Switzerland, where he found refuge, he witnessed the\r\nsufferings of the people caused by the crisis in the watch manufacture;\r\neverywhere the like miseries, due to the like social and political\r\nevils. Was it surprising that he should seek to remedy them by the\r\ntransformation of society?\r\n\r\nThe record[3] of the great anarchist trial at Lyons in 1883, to which we\r\nhave already referred, is an historical document of the first\r\nimportance. Every one who wishes to understand the causes, motives, and\r\naims of the anarchist movement should study it carefully. At the trial a\r\ndeclaration of opinion was signed by the accused. The following extracts\r\nwhich give the purport of this declaration may be useful in elucidating\r\nthe anarchist position. What they aim at is the most absolute freedom,\r\nthe most complete satisfaction of human wants, without other limit than\r\nthe impossibilities of Nature and the wants of their neighbours, equally\r\nworthy of respect. They object to all authority and all government on\r\nprinciple, and in all human relations would, in place of legal and\r\nadministrative control, substitute free contract, perpetually subject to\r\nrevision and cancelment. But, as no freedom is possible in a society\r\nwhere capital is monopolised by a diminishing minority, they believe\r\nthat capital, the common inheritance of humanity, since it is the fruit\r\nof the co-operation of past and present generations, ought to be at the\r\ndisposal of all, so that no man be excluded from it, and no man seize\r\npart of it to the detriment of the rest. In a word, they wish equality,\r\nequality of fact, as corollary, or rather as primordial condition of\r\nfreedom. From each one according to his faculties; to each one according\r\nto his needs. They demand bread for all, science for all, work for all;\r\nfor all, too, independence and justice.\r\n\r\nAs one of the accused maintained, even a Government based on universal\r\nsuffrage gives them no scope for effective action in the deliverance of\r\nthe poor, as of the eight million electors of France only some half a\r\nmillion are in a position to give a free vote. In such a state of\r\naffairs, and in view of the continued misery and degradation of the\r\nproletariat, they proclaim the sacred right of insurrection as the\r\n_ultima ratio servorum_.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most striking feature of the trial was the defence of Émile\r\nGautier before the Court of Appeal. Gautier was described by the Public\r\nProsecutor as a serious intelligence gone astray, a licentiate in law\r\nwho had passed brilliant examinations, a powerful orator who might be\r\nconsidered as the apostle of the anarchist idea in France. He was only\r\ntwenty-nine years of age. In his defence Gautier described with\r\npassionate eloquence how he, the son of a law-officer (_huissier_), had\r\nbeen converted to revolution and anarchism by the sight in court of the\r\ndaily miseries of debtors and bankrupts and other victims of a\r\ncapitalist society. As Voltaire is said to have had an attack of fever\r\nat every anniversary of the massacre of St. Bartholomew, so he, far away\r\nin Brittany, was seized with a fever of rage and of bitter indignation\r\nwhen the calendar brought round the accursed dates at which bills and\r\nrents became due.\r\n\r\nThe leading principles of anarchism are marked by great clearness and\r\nsimplicity, and may be summed up as the rejection of all external\r\nauthority and of all private appropriation of land and capital. All\r\nhuman relations will depend on the free action and assent of the\r\nindividuals concerned. Free associations will be formed for industrial\r\nand other purposes, and these associations will with a like freedom\r\nenter into federal and other relations with each other. The process of\r\nsocial reconstruction is, in short, the free federation of free\r\nassociations.\r\n\r\nConsidered as an historic socialist movement, anarchism may therefore be\r\nset forth under these three heads: (1) Economically it is collectivism;\r\n(2) it is a theory of revolutionary action, which is certainly its\r\ncharacteristic feature; (3) it is a theory of the relation of the\r\nindividual to law or government.\r\n\r\nAs regards the first point, its collectivism is common to it with the\r\nprevalent socialism, and therefore need not detain us here. Nor need\r\nmuch be said in the way of criticism of the details of the\r\nultra-revolutionary programme of the anarchists. In our chapter on Marx\r\nwe have already indicated that the materialism which is common to both\r\nschools cannot now be regarded as a tenable or admissible theory of the\r\nworld. The materialism of both schools sprang from the Hegelian left. It\r\nshould now be considered as dead, and should in all fairness be set\r\naside in discussion for or against socialism. With regard to religion\r\nand marriage, it is hardly necessary to state that progress lies not in\r\nthe abolition, but in the purification and elevation of those great\r\nfactors of human life. Bakunin’s criticism of religion is simply a\r\ntissue of confusion and misconception. Marriage is a fundamental\r\ninstitution, on the purity and soundness of which social health and\r\nsocial progress must above all things depend: in this matter, more than\r\nalmost any other, society must and should insist on the maintenance of\r\ndue safeguards and regulations. Free love is a specious and delusive\r\ntheory, which would tend to bring back social chaos. It would certainly\r\nestablish a new slavery of women, whose needs and rights would be\r\nsacrificed in the name of a hollow and disastrous freedom.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the third leading principle above mentioned, the negation\r\nof government and external authority, the anarchy of Bakunin is\r\nessentially the same as that of Proudhon. But in Proudhon the principle\r\nwas set forth in paradox, whereas Bakunin expounds it with perfect\r\nfrankness and directness, and with a revolutionary energy which has\r\nseldom been equalled in history. What they both contemplate is a\r\ncondition of human enlightenment and self-control in which the\r\nindividual shall be a law to himself, and in which all external\r\nauthority shall be abolished as a despotic interference with personal\r\nfreedom. It is an ideal to which the highest religion and philosophy\r\nlook forward as the goal of man, not as one, however, which can be\r\nforthwith reached through the wholesale destruction of the present\r\nframework of society, but through a long process of ethical and social\r\nimprovement. The error of the anarchists consists in their impatient\r\ninsistence on this proclamation of absolute freedom in the present\r\ndebased condition of the great mass of the people in every class. They\r\ninsist on taking the last step in social development before they have\r\nquite taken the first.\r\n\r\nLike its collectivism, the theory of freedom is not a special feature of\r\nanarchism. Collectivism is simply the economic side of the prevalent\r\nsocialism generally. Its theory of freedom is a very old theory, which\r\nhas no necessary connection whatever with a revolutionary programme, and\r\nwe should not misunderstand it because of the strange company in which\r\nwe here find it. It is a high and long-cherished ideal of the best and\r\ngreatest minds. The good man does his duty, not from fear of the police\r\nor the magistrate, but because it is his duty. And we must regard it as\r\nthe high-water mark of his probity and goodness that the right is so\r\nwrought into the texture of his conscience and intelligence that the\r\ndoing of it has become as natural to him as breathing or locomotion.\r\n\r\nIt is an ideal, also, which we must cherish for society and for the\r\nhuman race. And not in vain; for there is an ever-widening circle of\r\nhuman action, in which good and reasonable men do the right without\r\npressure or stimulus from without, either from law or government. We are\r\ntherefore to regard a well-ordered, intelligent, and ethical freedom as\r\nthe goal of the social development of the human race.\r\n\r\nBut it is an ideal which must obviously depend for its realisation on\r\nthe moral and rational development of men. It cannot come till men and\r\nthe times are ripe for it. No doubt the realisation of it may be\r\nhindered by evil institutions and reactionary Governments; yet these,\r\ntoo, are merely the outcome of such human nature as was once prevalent\r\nin the countries where we now find them. They have outlived their time.\r\nWe are certainly right to get rid of them, as of other evil habits and\r\nconditions of the past, but it is best done when done wisely and\r\nreasonably. And it cannot be done in any wise or effectual manner except\r\nthrough a wide organic change in the human beings concerned.\r\n\r\nA moral and rational freedom is therefore the goal of the social\r\ndevelopment of the world, and it is a goal towards which we must strive\r\neven now. But it is a goal that lies far ahead of us. For the present,\r\nand in the future with which we have any practical concern, society\r\ncannot be maintained without adequate laws, sanctioned and enforced by a\r\nregular Government. The elimination of the baser elements from human\r\ncharacter and human society proceeds with most regrettable slowness. In\r\nthe meantime, therefore, we must hold them in check by the best\r\navailable methods. We may improve our laws, our police, and magistrates,\r\nbut we cannot do without them.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact that socialism has taken its most aggressive\r\nform in that European country whose civilisation is most recent. The\r\nrevolutionary opinions of Russia are not the growth of the soil, and are\r\nnot the natural and normal outcome of its own social development: they\r\nhave been imported from abroad. Falling on youthful and enthusiastic\r\ntemperaments which had not previously been inoculated with the principle\r\nof innovation, the new ideas have broken forth with an irrepressible and\r\nuncompromising vigour which has astonished the older nations of Europe.\r\nAnother peculiarity of the situation is that the Government is an\r\nautocracy served or controlled by a camarilla which has often been\r\nlargely foreign both in origin and sympathy. In this case, then, we have\r\na revolutionary party inspired by the socialism of Western Europe\r\nfighting against a Government which is also in many ways an exotic, and\r\nis not rooted in the mass of the people.\r\n\r\nThe history of Russia turns on two great institutions, the Tzardom and\r\nthe mir. The Tzardom is the organ of Russian political life, while the\r\nmir is the social form taken by the agricultural population, and is the\r\neconomic basis of the nation generally.\r\n\r\nNo reasonable man can doubt that the Tzardom has performed a most\r\nimportant function in the historical development of Russia. It was the\r\ncentral power which united the Russian people and led them in the long,\r\nsevere, and successful struggle against Tartars, Turks, Lithuanians,\r\nPoles, and Swedes. Without it Russia would in all probability have\r\nsuffered the same fate as Poland, which was distracted, weakened, and\r\nfinally ruined by the anarchy and incurable selfishness of its nobles.\r\n\r\nAs in other countries, so in Russia, the central power was established\r\nthrough the subjection of princes and lords who were crushed by the\r\nstrong and merciless rule of the Tzars. Among those Tzars, too, were men\r\nof originality and courage like Peter the Great, who forced the people\r\nout of the old-world grooves which they loved so much; and when other\r\nmeans failed they did not hesitate to employ the cane, the knout, and\r\nthe axe of the executioner to urge their nobles into the paths of\r\nWestern progress. We need not say that the Tzars were not moved by\r\nbenevolent reasons thus to benefit their subjects. The historic Tzars\r\nwere not philanthropists or humanitarians. The aim of their reforms was\r\npolitical, to provide the Russian nation with better means and\r\nappliances for the struggle with her neighbours.\r\n\r\nWhile the nobles were unable to make head against the Tzardom, the\r\nclergy were neither able nor disposed so to do. In Russia the clergy\r\nwere not backed by a great international power like the Papacy. They\r\nwere nursed in the traditions of Eastern Greek despotism and had no\r\ninclination to resist their rulers. The peasants were not a political\r\npower, except at the rare intervals when desperation drove them into\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nThus the circumstances of Russia have combined to establish an autocracy\r\nwhich has performed the greatest historic functions, and which has had a\r\npower and solidity without example in the rest of Europe. It has\r\nmaintained the national existence against fierce and powerful enemies,\r\nit has in every generation extended the borders of the Russian power,\r\nand has been a real centre of the national life, satisfying the needs\r\nand aspirations of the people, not in a perfect manner by any means, yet\r\nwith a considerable measure of success. If we do not realise the supreme\r\nimportance of the work that the Tzardom has done for Russia, we cannot\r\nunderstand its present position and the hold it has on the feelings of\r\nthe Russian people. The power of the Tzar has been such that it was\r\nhardly an exaggeration, when the Emperor Paul stated to General\r\nDumouriez that there was no important man among his subjects except the\r\nperson he happened to speak to, and while he was speaking to him.\r\n\r\nIt is only another instance of the irony of human affairs, however, that\r\nthe really effective limit to the power of the Tzars is found in the\r\nofficials, who are intended to carry it into effect. These officials act\r\nas the organs of the imperial authority from the centre to the farthest\r\nextremities of the empire. Yet they can by delay, by passive resistance,\r\nby suggestion, by falsehood, by the arts of etiquette and ceremonial,\r\nand all the other methods familiar to the practised servants of\r\nautocracy, mislead or thwart the will of their master or render it of no\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nSuch is the central power. Let us now consider the body of the people.\r\nIn Russia, industry and city life have not formed a large part of the\r\nnational existence. The mass of the people still live directly from the\r\nsoil, and are organised in the mir. As is now well known, the mir is\r\nmerely the Russian form of the village community, which at one time\r\nprevailed over all the countries of the world, as they attained to the\r\nsedentary or agricultural stage of development. It was the natural\r\nsocial form assumed by people settling down into agriculture. It was the\r\nsocial unit as determined by obvious local economic and historic\r\nconditions. In most countries the village community has been reduced to\r\na shadow of its former self, partly through the operation of natural\r\neconomic causes, but largely also because the central power and the\r\nclasses connected therewith have crushed it out. The local life of\r\nEngland in particular has been repressed and starved through the want of\r\nthe most elementary resources and opportunities. It has been recognised\r\nas a most pressing duty of statesmen to revive and restore it in\r\naccordance with the prevalent conditions, but it will be long before the\r\ncapacity and habit of common action can be again adequately acquired.\r\n\r\nOwing to a variety of causes, which we cannot explain here, the Russian\r\nmir has continued to survive. It gave to the mass of the Russian people\r\ntheir own form of social life and of self-government; and it was\r\neconomically self-sufficing. The mir drew from the soil, which it held\r\nin common occupation, the means for its own support and for the support\r\nof the nation as a whole. The relations of the members of the mir to\r\neach other were substantially conducted on terms of equality and\r\nfreedom; but in view of the nobles and the Tzardom they were serfs till\r\ntheir emancipation in 1801. The mir was a social-economic arrangement,\r\nconvenient both for the noble proprietors and for the Tzardom. It\r\nafforded to the central Government the necessary taxes and the necessary\r\nrecruits; and therefore the Tzars did not disturb it, but rather sought\r\nto fix and solidity it, and thereby make it more efficient as a source\r\nof supply both of soldiers and material means. Thus for centuries, full\r\nof movement in the political history of Russia, the mir has with little\r\nchange endured as the social and economic basis of the national life.\r\n\r\nIn Russia, therefore, we find only two institutions that have had a real\r\nvitality and a specific influence, the Tzardom and the peasant\r\ncommunity. Nobles and priests have exercised a substantive power only\r\nwhen the Tzardom has suffered a temporary lapse. The middle class has\r\nalways been inconsiderable.\r\n\r\nIt was into a nation thus constituted that the most advanced\r\nrevolutionary opinions of Western Europe at last found their way. The\r\nspirit of revolt had indeed not been unknown in Russia in former times.\r\nAmong a peasantry sunk in immemorial ignorance and misery, and harassed\r\nby the incessant tribute of men and taxes which they were forced to pay,\r\ndiscontent had always been more or less prevalent, and it had sometimes\r\nbroken out in open rebellion. During the reigns of the great Catharine\r\nand of Alexander I. a sentimental Liberalism had been fashionable in the\r\nupper classes. But it was not a very practical matter, and was not a\r\nserious danger to the autocracy. At the beginning of his reign Nicholas\r\nhad to face a rising among the Guards at St. Petersburg, led by Liberal\r\nofficers of high birth. He suppressed it in the speediest and most\r\nsummary manner. Till his death, 1855, Nicholas maintained a _régime_ of\r\nrepression at home, and was the champion of absolutism in Europe.\r\n\r\nMany circumstances combined to render the accession of Alexander II. a\r\nnew departure in Russian history. The old methods of government had been\r\nthoroughly discredited by the failures of the Crimean war. There was a\r\ngeneral feeling that the ideas and methods of the West, which had proved\r\ntheir superiority during the struggle, must be tried in Russia. As the\r\nyoung Emperor recognised the necessity of a new policy, great changes\r\nwere made, and all went well for a time. Alexander carried the\r\nemancipation of the serfs, instituted new courts of law and a new system\r\nof local government, and gave a real impetus to education. It was not\r\nlong, however, before the Emperor began to hesitate in view of the\r\nLiberal forces which he had let loose, and which threatened to overturn\r\nthe whole fabric of Russian society. Like his uncle, Alexander I., the\r\nyoung monarch had not resolution enough to persevere in a practical and\r\nsystematic course of reform.\r\n\r\nThe changes already made, and the prospect of changes still to come,\r\nroused into action all the conservative instincts and prejudices of old\r\nRussia. The insurrection of Poland in 1863, which called forth the\r\nsympathies of many Russian Liberals, provoked also a powerful reaction\r\nin old Russian circles. An attempt by Karakozoff on the Emperor’s life\r\nin 1866 may be regarded as the turning-point of his reign. Ideas of\r\nsteady reform and of gradual temperate change have not yet become\r\nfamiliar to the Russian temperament. Between those who wished to reform\r\neverything, and those who wished no change at all or to change very\r\nslowly, no compromise was possible in the circumstances and conditions\r\nof Russian society. Thus a revolutionary movement soon declared itself\r\nin full opposition to the policy of the Tzar. When we consider that the\r\nnew party menaced not only the special political institutions of Russia,\r\nbut the fundamental principles of the existing society\r\ngenerally—property, religion, and the family—we can see that the\r\nbreach was inevitable.[4]\r\n\r\nThree stages may be recognised in the history of the revolutionary\r\nmovement. The first covered the period from the accession of Alexander\r\nII. in 1855 to about 1870. Its leading characteristic was negation, and\r\nthe name of Nihilism, which is often erroneously applied to the whole\r\nrevolutionary movement, should properly be restricted to this early\r\nstage. In the main it was simply the spirit of the Hegelian left frankly\r\naccepting the materialism of Büchner and Moleschott as the final\r\ndeliverance of philosophy. In a country where religion had little\r\ninfluence among the educated classes, and where philosophy was not a\r\nslow and gradual growth of the native mind, but a fashion imported from\r\nabroad, the most destructive materialism made, an easy conquest. It was\r\nthe newest fashion; it was the prevalent form among those who were\r\nreckoned the most advanced thinkers; it was clear, simple, and thorough.\r\nIt was particularly well suited to a state of culture which was\r\nsuperficial, without experience or discipline.\r\n\r\nIn the words of Turgenief, who has portrayed the movement in his novel,\r\n_Fathers and Sons_, the Nihilists were men who ‘bowed before no\r\nauthority of any kind, and accepted on faith no principle, whatever\r\nveneration may surround it.’ They weighed political institutions and\r\nsocial forms, religion and the family, in the balances of that negative\r\ncriticism, which was their prevailing characteristic, and they found\r\nthem all wanting. With revolutionary impatience they rejected everything\r\nthat had come down from the past, good and bad alike. They had no\r\nrespect for art or poetry, sentiment or romance. A new fact added to our\r\npositive knowledge by the dissecting of a frog was more important than\r\nthe poetry of Goethe or a painting by Raphael.\r\n\r\nNihilism as represented by Bazarof, in the novel of Turgenief, is\r\ncertainly not an attractive picture. We may respect his courage,\r\nhonesty, thoroughness, and independence; but his roughness, cynicism,\r\nand indifference to family feelings are very repellent. Through the\r\nearly death of the hero we are prevented from observing what might have\r\nbeen the further development of his character. We feel sure that if the\r\nstory of this typical life had been continued, we should have seen very\r\nconsiderable changes in a more positive direction. The mood of universal\r\nnegation can only be a temporary phase in individual or national\r\ndevelopment. Negation may be the physic, it cannot be the diet, of the\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nNo movement for emancipation can be a purely negative thing; and no\r\nmovement can be adequately described by reference to a single\r\ncharacteristic. The Nihilists found a wider view of the world in the\r\nwritings of Darwin, Herbert Spencer and J. S. Mill; and they had also at\r\nan early period felt the influence of Saint-Simon, Fourier, Robert Owen,\r\nand latterly also of Lassalle and Marx. From the first, Nihilism seems\r\nto have involved a broad and real sympathy with the suffering classes.\r\nThey wished to recall the attention of men from windy verbiage about art\r\nand poetry, from a sentimentalism which was often spurious, and from the\r\nclatter of the parliamentary machine, whose grinding was solely for the\r\nbenefit of the wealthier classes, to the question of ‘daily bread for\r\nall,’ to the common people perishing for lack of elementary knowledge.\r\nAnd they insisted strongly on the equal rights of women.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that Nihilism could only be a passing phase in the history\r\nof Russia, and that it had a wholesome and beneficial side as well as a\r\nrepellent one. In a country which was oppressed by an enormous burden of\r\nimmemorial prejudices and abuses, a powerful dose of negation was\r\ncalculated to have a most salutary operation. But the movement could not\r\nlong live on negations merely. As time went on, the struggle for\r\nemancipation in Russia began to assume a more positive character.\r\n\r\nIn this way the revolutionary movement entered on its second stage, the\r\nstage of socialistic teaching and propaganda. Events in the West had\r\nkindled the imagination of the youthful champions of liberty in Russia,\r\nthe rise and progress of the International, the terrible struggle at\r\nParis under the Commune, the growth of the German Social Democracy. A\r\npositive and far-reaching ideal now drew the aspirations of the\r\nenthusiasts for liberty, the deliverance of the proletariat, represented\r\nin Russia by an ignorant and wretched peasantry. The anarchic socialism\r\nof Bakunin was unquestionably the controlling element in the new Russian\r\nmovement. Beside it we must place the influence of Lavroff, another\r\neminent Russian exile, who represented the more temperate phase of\r\nanarchism, shading off into the recognition of a constitutional and\r\ngradual development of the theory. In its second stage also the\r\nrevolutionary movement of Russia was a mixed phenomenon. The anarchism\r\nof Bakunin continued, however, to be the characteristic feature, and\r\nthus the negative factor was still prominent enough.\r\n\r\nFrom Bakunin also proceeded the practical watchword at this stage of the\r\nrevolutionary movement, ‘to go among the people’ and spread the new\r\ndoctrines. And this course was unwittingly furthered by the action of\r\nthe Government. Early in the _seventies_, hundreds of young Russians of\r\nboth sexes were studying in Western Europe, particularly at Zürich in\r\nSwitzerland. As their stay there exposed them to constant contact with\r\nrevolutionary Russian exiles, and to infection with all the unsettling\r\nideas of the West, an imperial ukase of 1873 recalled them home. They\r\nreturned home, but they carried their new ideas with them. ‘Going among\r\nthe people’ was adopted as a systematic principle, a passion and a\r\nfashion among the youthful adherents of anarchism. In accordance with\r\ntheir creed they had no appointed organisation, no very definite plan of\r\naction. They ‘went among the people’ as the apostles of a new theory,\r\neach one as his heart moved him.\r\n\r\nThey went to be teachers or midwives or medical helps in the villages.\r\nIn order the better to identify themselves with the common folks, some\r\nlearned the humblest occupations. The trades of carpenter or shoemaker\r\nwere most usually chosen, as being the easiest to master. Others toiled\r\nfor fifteen hours a day in the factories, that they might have an\r\nopportunity of saying a word in season to their fellow-workers. Ladies\r\nand gentlemen, connected with the aristocracy and nurtured in all the\r\nrefinement of civilisation, patiently endured the nameless trials of\r\nliving with the Russian peasant. They endeavoured to adopt the rough\r\nhands and swarthy weather-beaten complexion, as well as the dress of the\r\npeasant, that they might not excite his distrust, for the gulf between\r\nthe lower classes and the gentlemen in Russia is wide and fixed. The\r\npeasants had experience of the gentleman only as the representative of\r\nthe Government coming with the knout and the police to extort taxes and\r\nrecruits. No wonder that the sight of a shirt underneath the sheepskin\r\nof the socialist missionary was enough to arouse the unconquerable\r\nsuspicion of the poor people of the country.\r\n\r\nThe success of the missionaries was limited. With all his strong\r\nsuspicion and his narrow range of ideas, the peasant could not easily\r\nunderstand the meaning and purpose of those strange men teaching strange\r\nthings. The traditions of the past, as they came down to him dim and\r\nconfused, contained many a bitter memory of disappointed hopes. He was\r\napathetic as well as suspicious. Moreover, the teacher often delivered\r\nhis message in half-digested formulas which had a meaning only as\r\nconnected with the economic development of Western Europe, and which did\r\nnot rightly attach themselves to anything within the experience of the\r\nRussian Peasantry.\r\n\r\nAbove all, the propaganda enjoyed only a very brief period of activity.\r\nThe teachers went about their work with very little circumspection, in\r\nthe careless free-and-easy way which seems so natural to the Russian\r\ntemperament. Consequently, the Government had no difficulty in\r\ndiscovering and following up the traces of the propagandists. Before the\r\nyear 1876 had ended, nearly all of them were in prison. More than 2000\r\nwere arrested during the period 1873-76! Many were detained in prison\r\nfor years, till the investigations of the police resulted in 50 being\r\nbrought to trial at Moscow and 193 at St. Petersburg at the end of 1877.\r\nMost were acquitted by the courts, yet the Government sent them into\r\nexile by administrative process.\r\n\r\nThe adverse experiences which we have recorded brought the attempts at\r\npeaceful propaganda to a close, and the revolutionary party decided on\r\nthe propaganda of action. They resolved to settle among the people and\r\nprepare them for a rising against the Government. Where peaceful\r\nteaching had failed, they sought to force a way by violent methods. It\r\nwas a desperate policy to pursue among a people who had not been able\r\neven to understand the aims of the revolutionary party.\r\n\r\nIt is very characteristic of the circumstances of Russia that the most\r\nsuccessful attempt at thus organising a scheme for revolutionary action\r\ncould gain the adhesion of the peasantry only by pretending that it had\r\nthe sanction of the Tzar. Jacob Stephanovitz, one of the prominent\r\nmembers of the revolutionary party, gave it out in South-Western Russia\r\nthat he had an order from the Tzar to form a secret society among the\r\ncommon people against the nobles, priests and officials who were\r\nopposing the imperial wishes to confer land and freedom on the peasants.\r\nThose to whom he addressed himself could hardly believe that the Emperor\r\nwas so powerless, but he did eventually succeed in forming a society of\r\nabout a thousand members. When the plot was discovered by the police,\r\nthe peasants were naturally enraged at the deception which had been\r\npractised on them. It should be added that such a method of action did\r\nnot meet with the approval of the party as a whole.\r\n\r\nLike the peaceful propaganda, the propaganda of action failed to gain a\r\nfirm footing among the people.\r\n\r\nAt every step the revolutionary party found the organs of the central\r\npower ready to suppress their efforts in the most summary way. They were\r\nnow convinced that they must directly attack the autocracy and its\r\nservants, and as they had received no mercy they decided to show none;\r\nand thus began the resolute, systematic, and merciless struggle of the\r\nrevolutionary party against the Tzardom. For this end they naturally\r\nmade a great change in their mode of action. They adopted a strong\r\norganisation instead of the lax discipline or total want of discipline\r\ncommended by Bakunin. Affairs were conducted by a secret central\r\ncommittee, who with unsparing energy carried out the new aims of the\r\nparty. The first great act in this the third stage of the Russian\r\nrevolutionary movement was the assassination of General Trepoff, Prefect\r\nof Police, by Vera Sassoulitsch, at St. Petersburg, in 1878. The\r\noccasion of the deed was the flogging, by command of Trepoff, of a\r\npolitical prisoner personally unknown to her. Her object was to avenge\r\nthe cause of outraged humanity on the servant of the autocracy. At the\r\ntrial she was acquitted by the jury, to the great surprise of the\r\nImperial Court. An attempt by the police to apprehend her on leaving the\r\nplace of trial was frustrated by the mob, and she succeeded in making\r\nher escape to Switzerland.\r\n\r\nThe public gave the most unmistakable proofs of sympathy with Vera\r\nSassoulitsch; and the event naturally excited great enthusiasm and\r\nemulation among the eager spirits of the revolutionary party. Police\r\nofficials and spies of the Government were cut off without mercy.\r\nGeneral Mezentseff, Chief of Police, was stabbed in the streets of the\r\ncapital in broad daylight. Prince Kropotkin, Governor of Charkoff, a\r\nrelative of the revolutionist, was shot. General Drenteln was also\r\nopenly attacked in the streets. After thus assailing the officers of the\r\nexecutive, they proceeded systematically to plan the assassination of\r\nthe Tzar himself, as the head of the central power which they abhorred\r\nso much. Solovieff fired five shots at the Tzar without doing any harm;\r\nthree attempts were made to wreck the imperial train, one of them\r\nfailing because the Tzar had made a change in his arrangements; and he\r\nescaped the terrible explosion at the Winter Palace only because he was\r\nlater than usual in entering his dining-room. These failures did not\r\nprevent the executive committee from prosecuting its desperate work, and\r\non March 13, 1881, followed the tragic death of Alexander II.\r\n\r\nWe need not say that the violent death of Alexander II. sent a thrill of\r\nhorror throughout Europe. It was felt to be a most lamentable and\r\nregrettable ending to a reign which had begun with such high and\r\ngenerous aspirations, and with so much promise of good to the Russian\r\npeople. There was a natural difficulty in understanding how a Sovereign,\r\nbenevolent in character and not unwilling to pursue a liberal policy,\r\nshould be the victim of a forward movement among his people. The\r\nexplanation must be found in the special circumstances of Russia, for\r\nAlexander was merely the representative of a political system which, by\r\nits historic evolution, its nature and position, has exercised an\r\nabsolute and often merciless mastery over its subjects, and the men that\r\ncut him off were youthful enthusiasts, who with revolutionary impatience\r\nwere eager to apply to the belated circumstances of Russia the most\r\nextreme theories of the West.\r\n\r\nThe historian has often to regret that more wisdom is not available for\r\nthe management of human affairs, and we may believe that a moderate\r\nmeasure of wisdom and patience might have prevented the fatal collision\r\nbetween the Tzar and the revolutionary party. The Tzardom, as we have\r\nseen, has performed a great and indispensable function in the national\r\nlife of Russia. It still seems to be the only practicable form of\r\ngovernment in such a country. No class is advanced or powerful enough to\r\ntake its place. The mass of the Russian people are not yet capable of\r\nself-government on a wide scale. There is no large educated class. The\r\nmiddle and industrial class, in the modern sense of the word, are still\r\ncomparatively small and unimportant; and it is probable enough that if\r\nthere had been an influential middle class, and if the abolition of\r\nserfdom had been effected under their auspices, the peasants would have\r\nreceived less favourable treatment than they experienced from the\r\nautocracy. The best available form of government for Russia seems to be\r\nan enlightened Tzardom, and the Emperor Alexander II. was personally\r\nboth enlightened and well-intentioned.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the position of the Tzardom cannot very long be tenable\r\nin its present form. Russia lies where it is, in close proximity to\r\nprogressive countries. In the past the Russian people have been largely\r\ndisciplined by Germans; they have learned much from England, and have\r\nperhaps shown the greatest social and spiritual affinity to the French.\r\nThis intercourse will go on. The strongest and most watchful Tzar cannot\r\nmaintain a Chinese wall of separation between his country and the rest\r\nof Europe. Nor can the Tzars expect to have the benefit of the science\r\nof Western Europe for military purposes, and at the same time succeed in\r\nshutting it out from influencing the social and political life of their\r\npeople. It is inevitable, therefore, that the liberal ideas of the West\r\nwill continue to dissolve and disintegrate the old fabric of Russian\r\nideas and institutions. One of two results appears necessary, either\r\nthat the Tzars must strenuously follow the path of reasonable and\r\nenergetic reform, or they may risk a revolution which will sweep away\r\nthe present central power.\r\n\r\nFor Russia, as for other countries, there are but two alternatives,\r\nprogress or revolution. If the latter consummation were to happen, it\r\ndoes not, however, follow that the cause of freedom would have any great\r\ndirect and immediate furtherance. In the circumstances of Russia the man\r\nwho wields the military power must be supreme. A new ruler resting on\r\nthe army might be not less an autocrat than the old. We can but say that\r\nthe present policy of the Tzardom is seriously retarding and arresting\r\nthe natural and national development of Russia, and that it tends to\r\nprovoke a catastrophe which may endanger its own existence. The\r\nindustrial progress now being made in the country renders it only the\r\nmore necessary that her political institutions should make a\r\ncorresponding advance.\r\n\r\nIt remains now to say a word about the revolutionists who have played so\r\nremarkable a part in the recent history of Russia. The members of the\r\nRussian revolutionary party have been drawn from nearly all classes of\r\nthe people. Some, as we have seen, belonged to highly placed\r\naristocratic families; some have been sons of priests and of the lower\r\nofficials. More recently the rural classes supplied active adherents to\r\nthe militant party. One of the most notable features of the movement is\r\nthe influence exerted in it by women. It was Vera Sassoulitsch who\r\nopened the death-struggle with the autocracy in 1878. A lady of high\r\nbirth, Sophia Perovskaia, by the waving of a veil guided the men who\r\nthrew the fatal bombs at the assassination of Alexander II.\r\n\r\nBut whether aristocrats or peasants, men or women, the members of the\r\nRussian revolutionary party have been remarkable for their youth. The\r\nlarge majority of those engaged in the struggle had not attained to the\r\nage of twenty-five. In view of their extreme youth, therefore, we need\r\nnot say that they had more enthusiasm than wisdom, and more of the\r\nenergy that aims at immediate success than of the considerate patience\r\nthat knows how to wait for the slowly maturing fruits of the best and\r\nsurest progress. Having regard to the very subversive theories which\r\nthey tried to sow broadcast among the masses of the Russian people, we\r\nsee clearly enough that no autocracy in the world could avoid taking up\r\nthe challenge to authority which they so rudely threw down. Only the\r\nGovernment of an enlightened people long familiar with the free and open\r\ndiscussion of every variety of opinion, can afford to give unlimited\r\nopportunity of propaganda to such views as were entertained by the\r\nRussian revolutionary party.\r\n\r\nYet while the theories of the party were from the first of a most\r\nsubversive nature, it is right to emphasise the fact that they did not\r\nproceed to violent action till they were goaded into it by the police\r\nand the other officials of the central Government. Indeed, the measures\r\nof the Government and its representatives have often directly tended to\r\nthe stirring up of the revolutionary mood. By their irritating measures\r\nof repression they provoked, among the students at the universities,\r\ndisturbances which they quelled by most brutal methods. Young men\r\narrested on suspicion, and kept in vile prisons for years while awaiting\r\ninvestigation, were naturally driven to hostile reflection on the\r\niniquity of a Government from which they received such treatment.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of a country like Russia, we need not say that the most\r\nelementary political rights were denied the revolutionists. They had no\r\nright of public meeting, no freedom of the press, no freedom of\r\nutterance anywhere. They were surrounded with spies ready to give to\r\nevery word and deed the worst interpretation. The peasants whom they\r\ndesired to instruct in the new teaching might inform upon them. Their\r\ncomrades in propaganda might be induced or coerced to betray them. It\r\nwas often fatal even to be suspected, as the police and the other organs\r\nof Government were only too disposed to take the most rigorous measures\r\nagainst all who were charged with revolutionary opinion. Nor could the\r\naccused appeal to the law with any confidence, for the ordinary\r\ntribunals might be set aside, and his fate be decided by administrative\r\nprocedure; that is, he could be executed, or condemned to prison or\r\nexile in Siberia, without the pretence of a legal trial. In such\r\ncircumstances it was natural that resolute champions of liberty should\r\nbe driven to secret conspiracy in its extremest form, and to violent\r\naction of the most merciless character.\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, historical accuracy obliges us to emphasise the fact\r\nthat the aims of the revolutionary party far exceeded all that is\r\nincluded in liberalism and constitutional government, it is only just to\r\nexplain that they resorted to violent methods only because the most\r\nelementary political rights were denied them. In the fiercest mood of\r\ntheir terrible struggle with the autocracy, they were still ready to\r\nthrow aside their weapons.\r\n\r\nIn the address sent by the Executive Committee to Alexander III., after\r\nthe death of his father, in March 1881, they offered to give up their\r\nviolent mode of action, and submit unconditionally to a National\r\nAssembly freely elected by the people. They meant under a constitutional\r\ngovernment to have recourse only to constitutional methods.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the number of those concerned in the Russian\r\nrevolutionary movement, it is not easy to speak with precision. There is\r\nno proof that the anarchist opinions have gained a large body of\r\nadherents in the country. The numerical strength of the party directly\r\nengaged in the struggle with the Tzardom has always been comparatively\r\nsmall. On the other hand, the movement has evidently met with a very\r\nwide sympathy in Russian society. In the absence of precise information,\r\nwe may quote the words of one who has a good right to speak for the\r\nrevolutionary party:—\r\n\r\n‘The Russian revolutionary movement is really a revolution _sui\r\ngeneris_, carried on, however, not by the mass of the people or those\r\nfeeling the need of it, but by a kind of delegation, acting on behalf of\r\nthe mass of the people with this purpose.\r\n\r\n‘No one has ever undertaken, and perhaps no one could with any certainty\r\nundertake, to calculate the numerical strength of this party—that is to\r\nsay, of those who share the convictions and aspirations of the\r\nrevolutionists. All that can be said is, that it is a very large party,\r\nand that at the present moment it numbers hundreds of thousands, perhaps\r\neven millions of men, disseminated everywhere. This mass of people,\r\nwhich might be called the Revolutionary Nation, does not, however, take\r\na direct part in the struggle. It entrusts its interests and its honour,\r\nits hatred and its vengeance, to those who make the revolution their\r\nsole and exclusive occupation; for under the conditions existing in\r\nRussia, people cannot remain as ordinary citizens and devote themselves\r\nat the same time to Socialism and the Revolution.\r\n\r\n‘The real revolutionary party, or rather the militant organisation, is\r\nrecruited from this class of revolutionary leaders.’[5]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[1] The detailed Life of Bakunin, promised by Cafiero and Elisée Reclus\r\nin the preface to _God and the State_, has apparently not yet been\r\npublished. Hence the above meagre account of life.\r\n\r\n[2] _Procés des Anarchistes_, p. 97.\r\n\r\n[3] _Le Procés des Anarchistes_, Lyons, 1883.\r\n\r\n[4] For the revolutionary movement in Russia under Alexander II. see\r\nAlphons Thun’s _Geschichte der revolutionären Bewegungen in Russland_.\r\nSee also Stepniak’s _Underground Russia_, and _Russia under the Tzars_.\r\n\r\n[5] Stepniak, _Underground Russia_, p. 264.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                         THE PURIFIED SOCIALISM\r\n\r\nWe have, in the preceding chapters, sketched the rise and the principles\r\nof the leading schools of historic socialism. The history we have\r\nreviewed is a most protean one, and very prolific in theories which are\r\nmore or less akin.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to trace certain general features of resemblance in the\r\ndevelopment of socialism. In the experiments conducted by the followers\r\nof Saint-Simon, Fourier, and Owen, we see a desire forthwith to create a\r\nready-made and complete socialism, which almost always ended in failure.\r\nLouis Blanc and Lassalle agreed in demanding the organisation of society\r\non democratic principles, and the establishment of productive\r\nassociations by a State thus constituted. The resemblance in type\r\nbetween the community of Owen, the _phalange_ of Fourier, and the free\r\ncommune of Bakunin is obvious; and it is not going too far to say that\r\nall of them have interesting points of analogy with the village\r\ncommunity, which has its survival in the Russian mir.\r\n\r\nThroughout the history of socialism we naturally also observe the\r\ncontrast between the tendency which more or less emphasises State\r\nauthority and the need of centralisation, and that other tendency which\r\nregards the local body as cardinal and decisive. As we have seen, that\r\ncontrast was perfectly clear in the earliest French socialism, in the\r\nschools of Saint-Simon and Fourier. While calling on the State to\r\nfurnish credit for productive associations, both L. Blanc and Lassalle\r\nstrongly insisted that these associations should be self-governing and\r\nself-developing. The centralising tendency was very marked in Rodbertus.\r\nThough it cannot be maintained that the Marx school insist excessively\r\non the claims of authority, yet in the conduct of the International they\r\nhad a severe struggle with the anarchist following of Bakunin. It is\r\nsimply the old question of authority and order in relation to individual\r\nand local freedom, which always reappears under the newest conditions,\r\nand which cannot be solved on absolute principles.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding those general features of resemblance, it would be a\r\nserious mistake to identify socialism with any of its forms, past or\r\npresent. They are only passing phases of a movement which will endure.\r\nIf socialism has given proof of a persistent vitality, it has also\r\nundergone many transformations, and will in all probability undergo many\r\nmore. Our task now is to inquire into the significance, tendency, and\r\nvalue of the general movement.\r\n\r\nThe problem before us is one of historical interpretation in the widest\r\nsense of the word. It is not an academic question which can be settled\r\nby the scholarly comparison of texts and systems.\r\n\r\nIf the socialistic movement were complete and finished, it would be\r\nmerely a subject of sympathetic analysis and generalisation by the\r\nhistorian. But the socialistic movement is not complete; it is in\r\nprocess of making—probably only in its early stage. It is a question,\r\ntherefore, which must be treated not only in the light of history and\r\nhuman nature, but with special reference to the now prevailing\r\nforces—industrial, political, social, and ethical. For on these will\r\ndepend the future course of the movement and its prospects of success.\r\nWhile socialism has a past, it has also a profound significance for the\r\npresent and the future. The great task for the student is to find out\r\nthe rational meaning and purport of socialism, its probable significance\r\nfor the present time and the time coming.\r\n\r\nFor the rational interpretation of socialism we cannot too often\r\nemphasise the fact that it is not an abstract system, but a thing in\r\nmovement. It is not wedded to any stereotyped set of formulas, whether\r\nof Marx or any other, but must be rooted in reality, and, while moulding\r\nfacts, it must adapt itself to them. Above all, we must ever remember\r\nthat it claims to represent the aspirations after a better life of the\r\ntoiling and suffering millions of the human race.\r\n\r\nEven a cursory review of the historic socialism is enough to show that,\r\nwhile it has been prolific of new thought in economics, it has been\r\ndisfigured by every kind of extravagance. In general, it has been far\r\ntoo artificial, arbitrary, and absolute in its treatment of social\r\nquestions. As we have seen, the early theorists especially were\r\nprofoundly ignorant of the laws governing the evolution of society. Many\r\nlater socialists of great influence have laid excessive stress on\r\nrevolution as the lever of social progress. Few of them have really\r\nappreciated the bearings of the population question on the great\r\nproblems of society. Most of them have been far too absolute in their\r\ncondemnation of competition. In fact, their general position consists\r\nfar too much in a sweeping condemnation of the present society,\r\nforgetful the while that it is only out of the present that the future,\r\nin which they place their hopes, can proceed.\r\n\r\nThe current socialism, too, has very prematurely shown a tendency to\r\ndegenerate into a stiff and barren orthodoxy, which seeks to apply\r\nnarrow and half-digested theories, without adapting or even reasonably\r\nunderstanding them, to circumstances for which they are not suited. This\r\nis particularly apparent in the attempts to introduce into England and\r\nAmerica formulas and modes of action which have grown up in the very\r\ndifferent atmosphere of the European continent. It has not sufficiently\r\nrecognised the fluent and many-sided variety of modern life, which\r\ncannot be embodied in any formula, however comprehensive and elastic.\r\n\r\nFinally, socialistic speculation has in many cases tended, not to reform\r\nand humanise, but to subvert the family, on the soundness of which\r\nsocial health above all things depends. It has not understood the\r\nsolidity and value of the hereditary principle in the development of\r\nsociety. Socialists have, in short, been far too ready to attack great\r\ninstitutions, which it must be the aim of all rational progress, not to\r\nsubvert, but to reform and purify.\r\n\r\nIn the socialistic treatment of other questions, such as capital, rent\r\nand interest, the same defects of arbitrariness and absoluteness are\r\napparent. But the extravagances of the historic socialism are so obvious\r\nthat they confute themselves, and we shall not dwell on this aspect of\r\nour subject. We must remember that most historic systems have had to run\r\nthemselves clear of the turbid elements with which they were originally\r\nmixed. Socialism, considered both as a movement and as a system of\r\neconomic thought, is still in process of development. Its theories must\r\nundergo the rough-hewing of continual controversy, discussion, and\r\ncriticism. The whole movement must pass through the test, the tear and\r\nwear of experience, under the conditions prescribed by history and the\r\nfundamental laws of human nature, before its ideals can hope to be\r\nwedded to fact. We might add that it will receive the purification of\r\nexperience; only, we have to lament that it is the fate of our ideals to\r\nsubmit also to the degradation of experience.\r\n\r\nA like charge of abstractness may justly be brought against the two\r\ngreat German economists, Adolf Wagner and Schäffle, whose writings have\r\nso largely promoted a better comprehension of socialism. Their economic\r\nworks are monuments of learning and lucidity, but their exposition and\r\ninterpretation of the subject are marked by that excessive love of\r\nsystem which is usually characteristic of German specialists. They have\r\nbrought to the discussion of the historic socialism the same\r\nsystematising spirit with which German economists have treated Adam\r\nSmith. The economists of the Fatherland have reduced the teaching of\r\nAdam Smith to a set of abstract propositions, and so have transformed it\r\nbeyond recognition. In like manner Adolf Wagner laboriously sums up\r\nsocialism in abstract language, whereas it is above all things a\r\nconcrete movement, instinct with change and with human passion. In his\r\n_Bau und Leben des sozialen Körpers_ Schäffle’s construction of\r\nsocialism is an elaborate attempt to conceive society as transformed and\r\ndominated by a single principle.\r\n\r\nSuch a point of view can never accord with the actual development of\r\nhistoric forces. In the past the great economic eras have been\r\nremarkable for the endless variety of forms which they have assumed.\r\nFeudalism was not a stereotyped system, but took a special form in each\r\nEuropean country, and in each country it changed from age to age. The\r\ncompetitive system has never entirely and exclusively dominated any\r\nsociety, and has been endlessly modified by custom and the traditions of\r\nthe past, by national and social interests, and by moral considerations.\r\nAdam Smith, the great expounder of natural liberty, did not put it forth\r\nas an abstract and exclusive principle, but set it in the light of\r\nhistoric fact, and reserved a large sphere where private enterprise\r\nneeded to be supplemented by the action of the State. We can only say of\r\nthe competitive system that it has been normal or prevalent over the\r\nmost advanced countries of the world for a considerable time. We must\r\nconceive socialism in the same way as claiming, when certain historical\r\nconditions have been realised, to be the normal or prevalent type of\r\neconomic and social organisation.\r\n\r\nIn fact, they have had too exclusively in view the theories of Marx and\r\nRodbertus. In his conception of socialism Wagner has been chiefly\r\ninfluenced by Rodbertus. Schäffle, in his _Quintessenz des Socialismus_,\r\nappears as the interpreter of the Marx socialism. Even the less absolute\r\npresentation of the socialistic theories by Lassalle should have been\r\nsufficient to bring out the contrast between socialism in movement and\r\nsocialism in the abstract.\r\n\r\nThis is very nearly equivalent to saying that both economists have been\r\ntoo much influenced by the Prussian type of government and theory of the\r\nState. With regard to the two socialists, Rodbertus and Marx, we are not\r\nsurprised that the former should be Prussian throughout in his way of\r\nthinking, but it is a notable instance of the irony of circumstances\r\nthat Marx should be so largely controlled by habits of speculation which\r\nhe had learned in Germany in his youth. He was to a great degree\r\nPrussian and Hegelian in his political and philosophical habit of mind\r\ntill the end of his life. It is natural enough that the conception of\r\nsocialism formed by Wagner and Schäffle should be of a similar\r\ncharacter. For them socialism is a system of centralisation, of\r\nmanagement from above (_von oben herab_) under a bureaucracy. Such a\r\nview may suit people that are used to a centralising autocracy and\r\nbureaucracy associated with militarism, but it is entirely opposed to\r\nEnglish ideas. An industrial and economic system which would remind us\r\nat every step of the Prussian army, the Prussian police and Prussian\r\nofficialism, is not attractive to those who have breathed a freer air.\r\n\r\nPrussia has had a great mission to perform in modern history. From its\r\ngeographical position and the circumstances attendant on its rise and\r\nprogress, we can see that it required a powerful army, a strongly\r\ncentralised government, and an industrial system entirely different from\r\n_laissez-faire_. We must respect the great vocations of the different\r\nhistoric peoples, among which Prussia has been one of the first. But\r\nthat is no reason for expressing socialism in terms suggested by the\r\nPrussian form of government, or for supposing that the claim of\r\nsocialism to control the economic organisation of the future will depend\r\non its conforming to the Prussian type of State. It is to be devoutly\r\nhoped that the type of government rendered necessary by the struggle for\r\nexistence among the nations on the European continent will not become\r\nuniversal.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nBut we must now consider a question which is vastly more important than\r\nany of the criticisms now offered. What may be regarded as the solid and\r\npermanent contribution to human progress made by socialism?\r\n\r\nThere should be no doubt that socialism has largely contributed to the\r\nfollowing results:—\r\n\r\n_First_, It has greatly helped to give prevalence to the historical\r\nconception of Political Economy. The very conception of socialism has\r\nbeen based on the idea of social-economic change. Their subject has\r\nnaturally led socialists to study the rise, growth, decline, and fall of\r\neconomic institutions. And, as we shall see later on, the influence of\r\nHegel and Darwin has taught them to merge the idea of historical\r\neconomics in the wider and more fundamental conception of evolution. In\r\nEngland socialists are now the chief promoters of the advance in\r\neconomic study from the ordinary standpoint to the historical, and from\r\nthe historical to the evolutionary point of view.\r\n\r\n_Secondly_, Socialism has greatly deepened and widened the ethical\r\nconception of Political Economy. It has, in season and out of season,\r\ntaught that the entire technical and economic mechanism of society\r\nshould be made subordinate to human well-being, and that moral principle\r\nshould be supreme over the whole field of industrial and commercial\r\nactivity. The charge sometimes brought against socialism, that it\r\nappeals only to the lower appetites and instincts of humanity, is most\r\nunjust. It would be a more reasonable criticism to say that it\r\ninculcates an unselfishness unattainable by any probable development of\r\nhuman nature.\r\n\r\n_Thirdly_, Socialism has brought the cause of the poor most powerfully\r\nbefore the civilised world. It is one of the enduring results of\r\nsocialistic agitation and discussion that the interests of the suffering\r\nmembers of the human race, so long ignored and so fearfully neglected,\r\nhave become a question of the first magnitude, the foremost question in\r\nall progressive countries. It is this question which gives a substantial\r\nbasis and a real meaning to the great democratic movement, which it\r\nwould be the gravest of all errors to regard as a merely political\r\nstruggle. The cause of the poor is likely to be the burning question for\r\ngenerations, lending to political questions their interest, seriousness,\r\nand unspeakable importance.\r\n\r\n_Fourthly_, Socialism has given us a searching criticism of the existing\r\nsocial-economic system. It may be said to have laid its diagnosing\r\nfinger on all the sores of society. The only objection that can be\r\nrationally taken is that the diagnosis has been an exaggerated one. All\r\nfair-minded judges will, however, admit that the socialistic criticism\r\nof the existing competitive system is largely, if not substantially,\r\njustified on the following points:—\r\n\r\n1. The position of the working people, who are the overwhelming majority\r\nin every society, is not in harmony with ethical ideas. It has often and\r\nlargely been a position of degradation, demoralisation, and misery.\r\nNormally, it is not consistent with what must be striven after as a\r\ndesirable condition for the mass of humanity, for it is insecure,\r\ndependent and to a large degree servile. The workmen have no reasonable\r\ncontrol of their dearest interests; have no guarantee of a settled home,\r\nof daily bread, and of provision for old age. It is a delusive freedom\r\nthat has no solid economic basis.\r\n\r\n2. The prevailing competitive system is to a large degree anarchy, and\r\nthis is not an accident, but a necessity of its nature. This anarchy has\r\ntwo great and baneful modes of expression: strikes, which are a form of\r\nindustrial war, carrying misery and insecurity over large sections of\r\npopulation, and sometimes menacing the industrial and social life of a\r\nwhole nation; and the great crises, which at times have even a more\r\ndisastrous influence, spreading like a storm over the entire civilised\r\nworld, overthrowing honourable houses of business, and exposing to\r\nhopeless ruin and starvation millions of honest people who are in no\r\nwise responsible for their fate. And the times of crash are succeeded by\r\nprotracted periods of stagnation, which for all concerned are scarcely\r\nbetter than the crises which caused it.\r\n\r\n3. The phenomena of waste, which are always more or less a feature of\r\nthe competitive system, are particularly manifest during the great\r\nindustrial and commercial crises. Not only are the products of industry\r\nintended for consumption wasted in vast masses, but the productive\r\nforces themselves, such as machinery and shipping, are sacrificed\r\nenormously, whilst great numbers of people are idle and starving.\r\n\r\n4. The prevailing system also leads to the large development of an idle\r\nclass of the most motley description. Those conversant with the history\r\nof revolutions know how influential an overgrown idle class has often\r\nbeen in forcing them on.\r\n\r\n5. The existing competitive system also necessarily leads to a vast\r\namount of inferior, inartistic production in all departments. Cheapness\r\nis too conspicuous a feature of every branch of industry.\r\n\r\n6. Our moral standards in every department of the national life have\r\nbeen lowered and corrupted by the excessive prevalence of a commercial\r\nand mercenary spirit. No rank, profession, or calling has escaped its\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\n7. Thus we are led to the general result, that inequalities of\r\ncondition, and the too prevalent anarchy and insecurity as well as the\r\nunworthy status of the workers under the competitive system, are a\r\npermanent source of trouble and even danger to society. The\r\ncircumstances of the workmen have improved; but it is doubtful whether\r\nthe improvement has kept pace with their advancing enlightenment and the\r\ngrowing sense of their rights and needs. Here again we must emphasise\r\nthe fact that the progress of democracy is not merely a political\r\nmatter. It means still more the continual development of intelligence\r\nand of higher and finer needs in the mass of the people, a fuller\r\nconsciousness of the claims of labour, a greater capacity for\r\norganisation, a wider moral and intellectual horizon. In the contrast\r\nbetween their moral and intellectual growth on the one hand, and their\r\ninsecure and inferior position as precarious wage-labourers on the\r\nother, we may at one and the same time discover a great danger to our\r\npresent social order and a splendid guarantee of further progress. Now,\r\nas ever, progress must be, attained through struggle, and perfection\r\nthrough suffering.\r\n\r\nScarcely any reasonable man therefore will deny that socialism has done\r\nexcellent service to mankind in so strongly emphasising the necessity\r\nfor further progress. While it has largely helped to rouse the working\r\nclasses out of their apathy, it has also done much to dispel the\r\ncomfortable optimism of those who had succeeded in the competitive\r\nstruggle for existence.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nThis criticism of society is valuable, but its effect is mainly\r\nnegative. We may go on to claim, however, that socialism, when purified\r\nfrom materialism, from the too revolutionary, absolute, and abstract\r\nelements with which it has been associated in history, can render a\r\npositive and substantial service to human improvement that would be\r\nvastly more valuable than any criticism. It may be maintained that in\r\nits main aim and tendency socialism is perfectly sound and right. For\r\namidst much error and exaggeration it has brought out the type of social\r\neconomic organisation which in the future should and will prevail.\r\n\r\nIn previous chapters it has been made abundantly clear that the\r\ncharacteristic feature of the present economic order lies in the fact\r\nthat industry is carried on by private competing capitalists served by\r\nwage-labour. According to socialism the industry of the future should be\r\ncarried on by free associated workers rationally utilising a united\r\ncapital with a view to an equitable system of distribution. As we have\r\nalready had occasion to say, no formal statement can rightly give\r\nexpression to the meaning of a great historical movement. But in such\r\nlanguage we believe the contrast between the old order and the new can\r\nbe most simply and at the same time with due adequacy expressed.\r\n\r\nThe same type of industrial organisation has been well set forth by J.\r\nS. Mill in these words: “The form of association, however, which, if\r\nmankind continue to improve, must be expected in the end to predominate,\r\nis not that which can exist between a capitalist as chief and workpeople\r\nwithout a voice in the management, but the association of the labourers\r\nthemselves on terms of equality, collectively owning the capital with\r\nwhich they carry on their operations, and working under managers elected\r\nand removable by themselves.”[1] Mill’s view of the subject, it may be\r\nremarked in passing, was derived from the study of French and English\r\nsocialists. His good sense saved him from the utopian extravagance of\r\nthese writers, and as he had little sympathy with the peculiarly German\r\nways of thought, he shows no tendency to the abstractness of the\r\nspecialists of the Fatherland. The result is a conception of socialism\r\nwhich is at once intrinsically more reasonable, more adapted to the\r\nEnglish mind and to universality, than any other offered by prominent\r\neconomists. And in this connection we need hardly add that by the\r\nEnglish mind we mean the mind of the English-speaking people; also,\r\nnotwithstanding all that may be said to the contrary, that the English\r\ntype of society has the best claim to universality, because it has best\r\nsucceeded in reconciling and realising the fundamental requirements of\r\norder and freedom.\r\n\r\nThe simple expression of the socialistic theory will, no doubt, in the\r\ncourse of propaganda and discussion, long continue to be overlaid and\r\nobscured by a mass of detail, sometimes utopian, sometimes all too\r\nabstract and systematic. It will be well, therefore, to keep the\r\nsimplicity of the type in view, but a few explanations may be necessary\r\nmore fully to elucidate it.\r\n\r\nThe true meaning of socialism, when rationally understood, is given in\r\nthe dominating tendencies of social evolution. On the one hand, the\r\neffect of the industrial revolution has been to concentrate the means\r\nboth of production and distribution in immense masses. Capital can now\r\nbe moved and controlled only on a large scale. The day for the small\r\ncapital, and the successful control of it by individuals, has passed\r\naway. It may continue under exceptional circumstances, but it can no\r\nlonger expect to be the normal or prevalent form of industry. On the\r\nother hand, the body of the people, represented by the modern democracy,\r\ncan legitimately claim that they shall no longer be excluded from the\r\ncontrol of their own economic and social interests. It is a rational and\r\nequitable demand that the prevalent divorce of the workers from land and\r\ncapital should cease. This divorce can be terminated, and the mass of\r\nthe people can be restored to a participation in the ownership and\r\ncontrol of land and capital, only through the principle of association.\r\nThis is the basis of socialism as given in the normal and dominant\r\nforces of the social evolution of our time. As we said in the\r\nintroduction, socialism is the child of two great revolutions—the\r\nindustrial revolution, and the vast social and political change embodied\r\nin the modern democracy.\r\n\r\nSocialism, rationally interpreted, is therefore simply a movement for\r\nuniting labour and capital through the principle of association. It\r\nseeks to combine labour and capital in the same industrial and social\r\ngroups. In such a group the present distinction between labourers and\r\ncapitalists would cease, and the workers become producers, equitably\r\ndisposing of the entire produce.\r\n\r\nSuch an industrial association would be self-governing. Socialism is an\r\nattempt to establish a free self-governing type of industry, and would\r\ntherefore seek to realise in the social-economic sphere the principles\r\nalready recognised in the political. It is a free self-governing form of\r\nindustry, corresponding in the economic sphere to the democratic system\r\nin politics; industry of the people, by the people, for the people. But\r\nwhile a rational socialism seeks to establish industrial freedom, it\r\naims also at promoting and securing industrial peace by terminating the\r\nstruggle between labour and capital, for, as we have seen, its aim is to\r\nunite them in the same group.\r\n\r\nUnder such a system the workers will have full control of their economic\r\ninterests. They will have the sobering and steadying discipline of\r\nresponsibility. They will no doubt make mistakes, as all bodies of men\r\nhave done since the beginning of the world; but as they will suffer by\r\nthem, so they will have the power of correcting them. It will be a\r\nself-reforming and self-developing system of industry.\r\n\r\nAnd it is hardly necessary to state that these associations will subsist\r\nin organic relation to one another. The State is, in idea or principle,\r\nsuch an association on the wide scale, just as the municipality or\r\ncommune is the local form of association; and their relations to each\r\nother may in various degrees and forms represent the principle of\r\nfederalism or centralisation.\r\n\r\nIn the history and condition of the working people it is a pathetic fact\r\nthat their sons, who have been gifted with exceptional capacity,\r\ngenerally go over to the richer classes. Their services are thus lost to\r\nthe class from which they sprang. It must be the aim of the socialist\r\nmovement also to terminate this incessant divorce between labour and\r\nintelligence, by providing within the groups of associated workers due\r\nscope for the best talent.\r\n\r\nSocialism claims to be the normal and prevalent type of organisation in\r\nthe future. The methods of production, distribution, and exchange will\r\nbe under social control. This being so, it may surely be regarded as a\r\nspecial instance of the arbitrariness and absoluteness of the current\r\nsocialism, when it maintains that all capital must pass out of\r\nindividual ownership. It may safely be maintained that such a condition\r\nof things is not possible, and that, if it were possible, it is entirely\r\nundesirable, because most likely to repress individual freedom, and\r\naffording indefinite scope for social tyranny. Under any conceivable\r\nsystem of society the free development of man is likely to be promoted\r\nby the possession of reasonable private means. The only objection that\r\ncan be rationally alleged against private property is when it involves\r\ninjustice to others—a possibility which, under socialism, is amply\r\nprovided against by the prevalence of social control over economic\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\nThe views just stated are not unwarranted by the historic socialism.\r\nAmidst much that is most extravagant, Fourier has the merit at least of\r\noffering the strongest safeguards for individual and local freedom.\r\nFourier provided that every worker should have the opportunity of\r\ngaining and maintaining a capital of his own, but under such social\r\nregulation that it would no longer involve wrong to others; and further,\r\nhe arranged that the owner should have perfect freedom to transfer his\r\nservices and his capital from one association to another. These are\r\nfeatures of Fourier’s system which have been too much neglected by\r\nscientific socialists so called; and in these respects he is much less\r\nutopian than his critics.\r\n\r\nIn no question is the arbitrariness of the historic socialism more\r\napparent than in the artificial attempts made to formulate a just method\r\nof distribution or remuneration. We have in previous chapters indicated\r\nthe different methods proposed in the schools of Saint-Simon, Fourier,\r\nand Louis Blanc. Nothing has so much tended to give a utopian air to\r\nsocialistic speculation. Our ideas of justice cannot well be expressed\r\nin a single formula, however comprehensive. It has been the endeavour\r\nmore or less of all moralists and legislators since the origin of human\r\nsociety to elucidate it and reduce it to some kind of reasonable form,\r\nbut with only very imperfect results; and socialists are not now likely\r\nto succeed in a task which is really impracticable. Progress in the\r\nrealising of justice can be attained only through the collective\r\nenlightenment and moral experience of the race; and it will always fall\r\nshort of our ideals, for our ideals rise as we approximate towards a\r\nrealisation of them, and so ever leave us behind in the race after\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nWe need not say, however, that it is an obvious implicate in every\r\nequitable theory of distribution that remuneration must generally depend\r\non work or desert. The normal income of the future must be based on\r\nservice rendered to society by all able members. Regard will be had to\r\nthe needs of the disabled.\r\n\r\nIt should be emphasised, moreover, that socialism must assert the\r\nsupremacy of morality over all the economic processes—production and\r\nexchange as well as distribution. Production should be rational and\r\nsystematic. Above all, distribution should be equitable. In these\r\nrespects socialism is fundamentally opposed to the one-sided conception\r\nof competition which has been so prevalent. It seeks to supersede the\r\nexisting competitive system of industry by a new order, in which reason\r\nand equity shall prevail.\r\n\r\nIt should also be clear that socialism supplies the much-needed\r\ncomplement and corrective of the principle of natural liberty advocated\r\nby Adam Smith. The principle of natural liberty had a great historical\r\nvalue, and when rightly understood must always be regarded as a prime\r\nfactor in every theory of social progress. But it can be applied only\r\nunder obvious limits, prescribed by reason and morality. The natural\r\nliberty of struggling individuals would, if unchecked, land us in social\r\nchaos. The true freedom of human beings is a rational and ethical\r\nfreedom. Such principles ought to prevail in the commercial relations of\r\nnations with each other, as well as in every other department of our\r\nindustrial and social life.\r\n\r\nSocialism, then, simply means that the normal social organisation of the\r\nfuture will and should be an associated or co-operative one. It means\r\nthat industry should be carried on by free associated workers. The\r\ndevelopment of socialism will follow the development of the large\r\nindustry; and it will rationally, scientifically, and systematically use\r\nthe mechanical appliances evolved during the industrial revolution for\r\nthe promotion of a higher life among the masses of the people.\r\n\r\nIt is a new type of industry and economic organisation the\r\npracticability of which must be decided by the test of experience. It\r\ncannot be introduced mechanically. We cannot force or improvise such a\r\nchange in the constitution of society. No revolutionary violence can\r\navail to carry through a transformation which runs counter to the\r\nfundamental laws of human nature or the great prevailing tendencies of\r\nsocial evolution. This will be especially manifest when we consider that\r\nits realisation will above all things depend on the ethical advance of\r\nthe mass of the people. Character cannot be improved by magic; it can be\r\nsubstantially ameliorated only by an organic change, external\r\ncircumstances co-operating with an inward moral spirit. The present\r\ncompetitive system must therefore be regarded as holding the field until\r\nsocialism has given adequate proof of the practicability of the theory\r\nwhich it offers.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[1] Mill’s _Political Economy_, People’s Edition, p. 465.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                   SOCIALISM AND THE EVOLUTION THEORY\r\n\r\nThe idea of evolution has had a great influence in the history of\r\nsocialistic speculation. Beginning with Saint-Simon most socialists have\r\nrecognised three stages in the economic development of mankind—slavery,\r\nserfdom, and wage-labour—which last they believe will be displaced by\r\nan era of associated labour with a collective capital. The idea of\r\ndevelopment may indeed be regarded as essential to socialism, inasmuch\r\nas it must contemplate a succession of social-economic changes in\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nMarx and Lassalle were both trained in the school of Hegel, and\r\nnaturally applied to the problems of society the Hegelian theory of\r\ndevelopment. The principle that economic categories are historical\r\ncategories, so much emphasised by Lassalle, was by him, as it was by his\r\nfellow-labourers, merged in the wider and more fundamental conception of\r\nevolution, historical economics thus becoming evolutionary economics.\r\n\r\nSome of the later socialists see in the theory of evolution associated\r\nwith the name of Darwin a suitable expression of their ideas of\r\ndevelopment. Followers of Marx have found special points of attraction\r\nin Darwinism. Darwin himself was, of course, not a materialist; but many\r\nspeculators have not unreasonably recognised in his teachings an\r\naffinity with materialism, which obviously accorded well with the\r\nmaterialistic conception of history held by Marx. The struggle of\r\nclasses, which Marx regards as the key to history, is, we need not say,\r\nalso an allied feature.\r\n\r\nBut the Darwinian conception of development has to many students\r\nsuggested the strongest reasons for doubt and hostility with reference\r\nto socialism. How does the theory of the struggle for existence consist\r\nwith the harmony of interests contemplated by socialism? Is it not\r\nutopian of the Marx school to believe that the struggle of classes,\r\nwhich has hitherto characterised the course of history, can be brought\r\nto a close by a great revolutionary act?\r\n\r\nCompetition, that _bête noire_ of the socialists, is simply the\r\nsocial-economic form of the struggle for existence. Is not competition,\r\ntherefore, the prime condition of social progress? And is not socialism,\r\ntherefore, inconsistent with progress?\r\n\r\nThus we are confronted with the twofold problem, whether socialism does\r\nnot deny the cardinal principles of evolution, and thereby also deny the\r\nprime condition of social progress?\r\n\r\nThese questions are of considerable complexity. And their import will be\r\nbetter understood it we consider them in relation to another question\r\nwith which they are intimately connected, and which is even more\r\nfundamental—the population question. The Darwinian theory of evolution\r\nrests on the Malthusian theory of population, and can be fully\r\nappreciated only by reference to it.\r\n\r\nIn this place we need not discuss the theory of population as a whole,\r\nbut merely in so far as it bears on our present inquiry. The theory of\r\nMalthus is so remarkable for its simplicity that no worthy excuse can be\r\noffered for the misconceptions regarding it which have been prevalent.\r\nThe seeds of life, so runs the theory of Malthus, have been scattered\r\nthroughout the world with a profuse and liberal hand. All living things\r\ntend to multiply indefinitely. Animals—even the least prolific—would,\r\nif their increase were not checked, fill the entire world. But as the\r\nmeans of subsistence are limited, the struggle for existence inevitably\r\nensues, which is obviously all the more intense because so many animals\r\nare themselves the means of subsistence to others.\r\n\r\nSo with man. If his natural powers of increase were exercised without\r\ncheck, it is only a question of time when the globe itself would be too\r\nsmall for the numbers of human beings, even though equipped with the\r\nmost effective means of cultivation. In point of fact, population has\r\nalmost always pressed on the available means of subsistence. The only\r\nimportant exceptions are found in new countries, when opened up to\r\ncolonists who have brought with them the superior methods of\r\nexploitation developed in more advanced civilisations.\r\n\r\nThus the history of the human race is largely the record of a struggle\r\nfor the means of subsistence caused by the pressure of population. Not\r\nthat the population is necessarily dense. Some of the most thinly\r\nscattered peoples have had the greatest difficulty in making a living,\r\nsimply because the available means of subsistence were exceptionally\r\nscanty, as the North American Indians, and above all in the continent of\r\nAustralia before its settlement by Europeans. The study of human history\r\nshows that if the population was small, it was not owing to any defect\r\nin the natural powers of increase of human beings.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the Malthusian theory rests on two great facts: (1)\r\non the physiological fact, viz. that all human beings are capable of\r\nindefinite increase; and (2) on a natural economic fact, that the means\r\nof subsistence are not capable of a corresponding indefinite increase,\r\nthe ultimate reason of this being nothing else than the limited size of\r\nthe planet on which we live. The inevitable result is the struggle for\r\nexistence. The Darwinian theory of the struggle for existence has the\r\nwidest application to human society and human history.\r\n\r\nThis struggle has gone on through a great variety of stages. In the\r\nearliest phases of human history it generally resulted in the\r\nextermination of the vanquished, and was often associated with\r\ncannibalism. As society advanced from the hunting and pastoral into the\r\nagricultural state, the victors saw that it would be their interest to\r\nspare the vanquished that they might enjoy the benefit of their labour\r\nas slaves. In this way began the institution of slavery, on which\r\nancient civilisation rested. The warlike tribes that overturned the\r\nRoman Empire found that they could more easily and conveniently utilise\r\nthe labour of the vanquished under the various forms of serfdom. In\r\nmodern times free workers, destitute of capital, are ready under a\r\nsystem of competition to perform the labour of society for a wage that\r\nrenders them the customary subsistence.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest stages the struggle was one for bare existence, not far\r\nremoved above the lower animals; but as time went on, it began, as we\r\nhave seen, to take a higher form. The main motive power, however, has\r\nalways been the self-regarding principle in which the struggle\r\noriginated. On the whole it was only a more rational and enlightened\r\nself-interest which dictated the change from extermination to slavery,\r\nfrom slavery to serfdom, and from serfdom to the system of competitive\r\nfree labour. Idealism, the longing for a better life, has always had a\r\nconsiderable power in human affairs, and we hope that its influence will\r\nnever cease to grow and prevail. Yet it could not be seriously\r\nmaintained that the peoples who instituted slavery, serfdom, or the\r\ncompetitive system, were in the main actuated by ideal or high ethical\r\nmotives. It is our duty to recognise with thankfulness that the\r\ninevitable progress of society has brought with it a higher life, even\r\nthough it be merely due to a more enlightened self-interest.\r\n\r\nThus, while in its early stages it was a struggle for mere existence, in\r\nlater times it has become more and more a struggle for a privileged or\r\nsuperior existence. The victors in most historic struggles have reserved\r\nto themselves the loftier functions of government, war and the chase,\r\nand the vanquished have been constrained to provide a subsistence both\r\nfor their masters and themselves by means of labour. Life still is a\r\nstruggle for the best places in society. And it is a particular object\r\nof struggle not to belong to the class of manual labour.\r\n\r\nThe competitive system is the latest form of the struggle for existence.\r\nIt is not an accident, but the outcome of the prevalent historic forces.\r\nThe time had come when free labour was found to be more efficient than\r\nservile labour. The feudal system, of which serfdom was a part, went\r\ndown before the strongly centralised State. The competitive system is\r\nthe form assumed by the struggle for existence in societies which were\r\ncontrolled by powerful central governments; it is industrial freedom\r\nunder conditions of legality enforced by strongly constituted\r\ngovernments. In earlier and less settled states of society the struggle\r\nfor existence used to be decided by more direct and forcible methods. In\r\nother days men slew their rivals; at the present time they undersell\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAnd we need not say that the competitive system has been a process of\r\nselection, bringing to the front, as leaders of industry and also as\r\nheads of society, the fittest men.\r\n\r\nThe struggle for existence, therefore, has continued through human\r\nhistory, and does still continue. And we may feel assured that under the\r\npressure of an ever-increasing population it will continue. The only\r\nquestion is regarding the form it is likely to take in the historic\r\nconditions which now tend to prevail all over the world.\r\n\r\nFor no conclusive solution of the population question is possible under\r\nany system. It has been a fundamental difficulty since the beginning of\r\nhuman society, and more than anything else may be regarded as the key to\r\nhistory. The migrations, wars, and conquests recorded in history have\r\nfor the most part had their origin in want caused by the pressure of\r\npopulation on the extant means of subsistence. No doubt, ambition,\r\nvanity, suspicion, and restlessness have played a very considerable part\r\nof their own in the military annals of the race, but not nearly so large\r\na part as is generally supposed. Historians have not given anything like\r\nadequate attention to the economic factors which have often so\r\ndecisively operated in human affairs.\r\n\r\nIn its most comprehensive form, indeed, the population question does not\r\nconcern the immediate future, for the world is not nearly replenished\r\nwith human beings. In all the countries dominated by European\r\ncivilisation, wealth has, owing to the vast mechanical development of\r\nthe last hundred years, increased much more rapidly than population. But\r\nthe question is one which does already practically concern the more\r\npopulous centres over large areas of the world. In many of the old seats\r\nof population, both in Europe and the East, the struggle for existence\r\nis intense, and if not strongly counteracted, must tend to the increase\r\nof egotism, unscrupulousness, and general demoralisation. This is most\r\nobservable in cases where a large population has to face the prospect of\r\na declining prosperity. If the prosperity of this country were menaced\r\nby a great war, or a great shock to the national credit, or by both\r\ntogether, or simply by the slow decline of its industrial and commercial\r\nsupremacy, the struggle for existence in our large towns would be\r\nunspeakable.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, therefore, that we are not yet done with the problem of\r\npopulation. It is always a serious matter in the great centres; it may,\r\nunder very conceivable circumstances, be a fearful dilemma at no very\r\ndistant date; and as the world becomes more thickly peopled it will more\r\nand more present itself as a pressing question. We cannot here, however,\r\nenter into a detailed discussion of the problem. It will probably always\r\nbe a difficulty, and will call forth a variety of answers. But, as we\r\nhave already said, no satisfactory and conclusive solution can be\r\noffered or expected by any one who understands the conditions of the\r\nproblem. The solution must wait on the moral and social development of\r\nmankind. There is certainly no prospect of the question being materially\r\naffected by any physiological modification of the human constitution. We\r\ncan only hope that the present progress of civilised countries in\r\nmorality, intelligence, and in a reasonable standard of living, will\r\ncontinue; that the improvement in material and economic conditions will\r\ngo hand in hand with ethical advancement; that the happiness of mankind\r\nwill not be wrecked by the irrational and unrestrained gratification of\r\na single passion. If the mass of the people remain as they are, ready to\r\nsacrifice their own happiness and that of posterity to animal instinct,\r\nthe population question cannot be solved, and the best hopes of human\r\nprogress must be unfulfilled.\r\n\r\nFor socialism, as we have explained it, it may be claimed that it gives\r\nthe strongest guarantees that the difficulty will receive the best and\r\nmost rational treatment. As socialism generally means the supremacy of\r\nreason and morals over the natural forces, so with reference to the\r\npopulation question it means that natural appetite should be controlled\r\nby nobler and more rational feelings and principles. Under a socialistic\r\nsystem every member of the community will be interested in this as in\r\nevery other serious question. The general enlightenment and the social\r\nconscience will most powerfully co-operate with the light and the\r\nconscience of the individual to effect a reasonable and a beneficent\r\nsolution, as far as possible.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nBut we must now return to the questions with which we started—the\r\nrelation of socialism to the struggle for existence, and to social\r\nprogress as dependent on the struggle for existence. As we have seen,\r\nthe Darwinian theory of the struggle for existence has the widest\r\napplication to human society and human history. But the struggle for\r\nexistence is not the sole principle of social progress. Social progress\r\nproceeds from the interaction, the balance and harmony, of many\r\nprinciples. The general question of social development, in which that of\r\nprogress is involved, must be regarded in the light of the following\r\nconsiderations. Only we must premise that they are not a contradiction\r\nof the Darwinian theory; they are to be taken as a complement of it, and\r\na correction of the narrow and one-sided conception of the theory.\r\n\r\n1. The political, social, and ethical development of mankind is largely\r\na record of the endeavour to place the struggle for existence under\r\nregulation. Progress chiefly and supremely consists in the growing\r\ncontrol of ethical principle over all the forms of selfishness, egotism,\r\nunscrupulousness, and cruelty called forth by such struggle. In other\r\nwords, progress mainly consists in the growing supremacy of law, order,\r\nand morality over the excess of the self-regarding principle in which\r\nthe individual struggle has its root. We do not say that this exhausts\r\nthe meaning of the ethical development of man, but it is a most\r\nimportant aspect of it.\r\n\r\nThus the ethical factor is the decisive one in human progress, but it\r\nhas advanced _pari passu_ with the general social and political\r\nprogress. We see it in the crudest and most elementary forms when man\r\nemerged from the darkness of pre-historic times, and it has gradually\r\ndeveloped into a noble complex of ideals, informed by a growing\r\nknowledge and by widening sympathies. In short, human progress has been\r\na continual effort towards the realisation of the true, the beautiful,\r\nand the good, in such measure as was attainable by each succeeding\r\ngeneration of the race.\r\n\r\nNot that the struggle for existence is hereby abolished. The struggle,\r\nand the regulation of it too, are carried forward into a further stage\r\nof progress, to be continued on a higher social and ethical plane. The\r\nhuman struggle generally is on a higher plane than the animal one which\r\nDarwin describes. It is a struggle on the plane of an intelligence which\r\nnever ceases to develop, amongst beings who pursue social and ethical\r\naims with growing clearness and energy. If the results still fall so far\r\nbelow our aims, it is because our intelligence and means of performance,\r\nthough enlarging, are still very imperfect.\r\n\r\nWhat we call natural selection in the animal world is in human history\r\ntransformed, elevated, and idealised; it becomes social selection. We\r\nmay call it natural, if we please; only, we must remember the greatly\r\naltered character of the agents concerned in it. While at every stage we\r\nsee moral and intellectual growth, we must particularly remember that\r\nthe new society for which socialists strive will consist of associated\r\nfree beings acting under the regulation and stimulus of high ethical and\r\nartistic ends and ideals.\r\n\r\nNothing, therefore, can be more narrow and one-sided than to consider\r\nthe struggle for existence as the sole lever of human progress. Such\r\none-sided insistence on the idea of struggle is to deny the whole\r\nethical development of the world.\r\n\r\nSocialism professes to continue and promote the ethical and social\r\ndevelopment which we have described; on a higher plane of progress than\r\nhas hitherto been reached to place the natural economic powers operating\r\nin human destiny under the regulation of reason, moral principle, and\r\nideals of beauty; to render technical and mechanical appliances, and all\r\nthe material and economic factors underlying human life, subservient to\r\nthe well-being of man in a way hitherto unattained; and so to achieve\r\nthe ethical freedom of man and his rational supremacy over the world.\r\nThe competitive system is the latest phase in the struggle for\r\nexistence, and socialism is the latest theory for the regulation of it\r\nalong the well-approved lines of human progress.\r\n\r\nBy such tests, none lower or narrower, must a rational socialism be\r\ntried.\r\n\r\n2. There is, however, one side of this ethical progress which deserves\r\nto be more particularly considered. The ethical progress of man is\r\nlargely a development of the principle of sociality, community, or\r\nassociation. This principle has its centre in the family, with all that\r\nis implied therein; in the association of man and woman, in the\r\nsacrifices made by both and especially by the mother for the children.\r\nHistorically, it has developed from the tribe into ever wider and more\r\ncomplex forms—the city, nation, and race—until it more and more\r\nembraces the whole human family. That is, it finally tends to become\r\ninternational, so that the whole human family may be included in common\r\nethical and social bonds—a state of things which is still far from\r\nbeing realised, but it is in process.\r\n\r\nIn the evolution of living things two factors have been decisive, the\r\ndevelopment of brain power and the development of the social principle.\r\nWe need scarcely add that the two are intimately connected, and further\r\nthat the brain power of man is closely co-ordinated with his physical\r\ndevelopment. The supremacy of man is due to his brain power and to his\r\nreadiness to associate for common ends, far more than to his strength or\r\nhardihood, in which he is greatly excelled by other animals. The entire\r\nhistory of civilisation bears witness to the potency of the two factors;\r\nfor it is a truism to say that the communities and races that have\r\nexcelled in brain power and in the family and social moralities have\r\nprevailed. A rational socialism might be defined as the mastery of\r\nassociated human intelligence over the resources of nature for the\r\ngeneral good. In this respect, also, the success of socialism would\r\nsimply mark the continuous development of man along the tested and\r\napproved lines of progress.\r\n\r\nIt is no doubt one of the many exaggerations of Lassalle, due partly to\r\nhis function of agitator, that he laid excessive emphasis on the\r\nprinciple of community as the lever of progress, compared with the\r\nindividual principle. Progress has always depended on the action and\r\ninteraction of both principles. It is rather an idle question, which of\r\nthe two is the more important; like that other question, whether the\r\ngreat man makes the age, or the age makes the great man. The man and the\r\nage make each other.\r\n\r\nWe know the great influence often exerted in history by exceptional\r\nbrain power or character, and both are often associated with a prominent\r\nindividual. But high individual capacity is usually, if not always,\r\nfound in an age and community with a high average of talent.\r\nWell-organised and well-endowed societies are most likely to produce the\r\nstrongest and finest individuals, and it is only in such societies that\r\nthe greatest individuals are likely to find adequate scope for their\r\npowers. We cannot form a just estimate of our subject unless we give due\r\nweight to both principles, but obviously the danger to society lies in\r\nthe excessive development of the individual principle. History has too\r\noften witnessed the abnormal development of private selfishness, so\r\novergrown as to weaken and finally dissolve the society in which it\r\nacted, thus accomplishing its own destruction. This is indeed the open\r\nsecret of the ruin of most communities that have existed. We should seek\r\nin vain for an instance of a community ruined by excessive regard for\r\nthe public good. A happy and wholesome individual development can be\r\nsecured only by healthy relation and due subordination to society and\r\nthe common weal.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, then, that the principle of sociality or of association\r\nplays a specially important part in human development. Yet in close\r\nconnection with it we again observe the wide operation of the struggle\r\nfor existence. The struggle for existence is not only a struggle of\r\nindividuals against each other. It has also been a struggle of tribe\r\nagainst tribe, of city against city, of nation against nation, and race\r\nagainst race. In the existing society it is, moreover, a struggle of\r\nclasses against each other. Considered in this aspect, which is too\r\nobvious to require illustration, the struggle for existence has assumed\r\nthe most complicated forms, and has had the greatest influence in the\r\nhistory of the world. And the intensity of the struggle has called forth\r\nsome of the highest human qualities—inventiveness, capacity for\r\norganisation, submission to discipline, enthusiasm, heroism, and\r\nself-sacrifice. The struggle, hateful though it be in many respects, has\r\nbeen one of the great training schools of the human race.\r\n\r\nModern European history is an impressive example of the importance of\r\nthis struggle for existence. The progress of Europe is greatly owing to\r\nthe fact that in this continent we have a group of communities which are\r\nclosely related, yet independent, and rivals. In every department of\r\nactivity they learn from each other, and spur one another on by\r\ncontinual emulation. Each must follow its rivals in the adoption of\r\nevery new improvement, under penalty of decline and even ruin.\r\nCommunities like China and India in the old world, and the native States\r\nof Mexico and Peru in the new world, were isolated, and therefore\r\nstationary.\r\n\r\nUnder the existing conditions, a social organisation favourable to the\r\ndevelopment of the intelligence, energy, and enthusiasm of the mass of\r\nthe people is more and more necessary to success in the keen and arduous\r\nstruggle waged by the European communities. The future both of democracy\r\nand of socialism will largely depend on how far they can supply these\r\nadvantages of organisation. For it is a struggle also between forms of\r\nsocial organisation. Any better form of organisation, when adopted by\r\none of the communities, must also be adopted by its rivals. As soon as\r\nit was recognised that universal education and universal liability to\r\nmilitary duty gave Prussia an exceptional advantage in the European\r\nstruggle, other nations have been eager to follow.\r\n\r\nThus, through the development of the principle of sociality in the\r\nhistory of civilisation, the struggle for existence is not abolished. It\r\nis continued under more complex conditions, on a wider scale, over\r\nlarger areas, by greater masses of organised men, with mightier weapons\r\nand vaster resources.\r\n\r\n3. It is one of the most interesting aspects of history, that we regard\r\nit as the education of the human race. Social progress is the result of\r\na long process of discipline, and the training has often been most\r\nsevere. It would appear as if mankind needed to be goaded and driven\r\nforward on the path of improvement.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the struggle for existence throws new light on the\r\neducation of humanity. The nations of the world have been schoolmasters\r\nto each other; and the competitive system, too, has been a process of\r\ndiscipline for all who have been concerned in it. Socialism, rightly\r\nunderstood, may be regarded as a new phase of the discipline of\r\nhumanity. For the transition into socialism, if attainable at all, will\r\nbe more difficult than many suppose. It must be gradual, preparing the\r\nminds and morals, the habits and institutions, of the mass of the people\r\nfor a higher form of social-economic life. As isolated individuals, the\r\nworking class have no prospect of success. They can make progress only\r\nby practising the virtues of combination, foresight, self-control,\r\nself-denial, discernment in choosing their leaders, loyalty, unwearying\r\nperseverance in well-doing. These qualities have been already cultivated\r\nin them by means of their trade-unions and co-operative societies. The\r\nprocess of socialistic evolution will carry on the process of\r\nsocial-economic education.\r\n\r\nSocialism must therefore be regarded as providing an economic and social\r\ndiscipline for all men who have the requisite insight, and particularly\r\nfor the working class, who are its special representatives and\r\npromoters. It will offer fresh scope and opportunity to the working\r\nclass as a whole. But it will also be a process of social selection;\r\nfor, while inviting all, it will attract the fittest and most worthy,\r\nand lead them on to higher things.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n                      RECENT PROGRESS OF SOCIALISM\r\n\r\nDuring recent years the organised socialism has made notable progress in\r\nnearly all parts of Europe. The German working men still continue to\r\nform the vanguard of the proletariat of the world. At the general\r\nelection of 1893 the Social Democrats polled 1,786,000 votes, which was\r\nan increase of nearly 360,000 on the large figures of 1890. At the\r\ngeneral election of 1898 the Social Democratic vote rose to about\r\n2,100,000. Their seats in the Reichstag increased from 48 to 56, out of\r\na total of 397.\r\n\r\nThere is no change to record in the principles of this powerful party.\r\nIts tactics, while remaining essentially the same, naturally vary to\r\nsome degree according to circumstances. It adheres to the Erfurt\r\nprogramme. Its single-minded aim is the advocacy and promotion of the\r\ninterests and ideals of the working class of Germany without compromise\r\nand without alliance with other parties, though it is ready to\r\nco-operate with them in particular questions. The party consistently\r\nrefuses to vote for the imperial budgets, not only because they are\r\ndesigned for the support of militarism, but because they are so largely\r\nmade up of indirect taxes that throw an unfair burden on the poorer\r\nclasses. To the high tariff, which, after long discussion, came into\r\noperation in 1906, they offered the most strenuous resistance. The\r\nSocial Democrats are also in general opposed to the colonial policy of\r\nthe empire. They are the champions of the democratic rights of the\r\npeople, of free speech, of a free press, and especially of the right of\r\ncombination, which was lately threatened by the Emperor. In all matters\r\nrelating to factory legislation and the better protection of the working\r\nclass in its daily life and vocation they are forward both to make\r\nsuggestions themselves and to assist any legislation which is really\r\nfitted to contribute towards these important ends. They claim, in fact,\r\nto be the representatives and advocates in the widest sense of the\r\nworking class of Germany, and are opposed to all measures which tend to\r\nstrengthen the class State to which they are so entirely opposed. While\r\nexpressing a preference for peaceful methods, they still regard as\r\nprobable a great crisis or catastrophe by which they will gain political\r\npower and so realise their collectivist ideal. Such a crisis will, they\r\nsay, be brought on not by them but by the ruling classes, of which the\r\nclass State is the representative.\r\n\r\nAt the Annual Congress at Stuttgart in 1898 the busts of Marx and\r\nLassalle appeared on the platform amidst laurels and palms. The busts of\r\nLassalle, Karl Marx, and Engels were grouped amidst ferns and flowers\r\nround an allegorical figure of Liberty on the platform at the Hanover\r\nCongress of 1899. It is only right to add that, with the development of\r\nSocial Democracy in Germany and throughout the world, the stage on which\r\nthese men appear seems to widen and their stature to grow. Their\r\nwritings, whether learned or popular, are read and pondered in all lands\r\nof the civilised world, sometimes leading to organisation and action,\r\noften to latent thought and conviction ready to bear fruit in due time.\r\nLassalle and Karl Marx promise to be, if they are not already,\r\nhistorical figures of the first magnitude.\r\n\r\nIt is also clear that, if the Social Democracy means to be worthy to\r\nguide the destinies of the working class of Germany, it must not stiffen\r\nand degenerate into a sect. Its principles and tactics founded on the\r\nviews of Marx must be subject to continual discussion and to revision.\r\nThe party is disposed to take Marx too literally, more literally than\r\nMarx took himself. They have been disposed out of season to emphasise\r\nthe ultra-revolutionary side of Marx. We have already seen that this\r\nultra-revolutionary side of Marx was the product of a time and of\r\ncircumstances which no longer prevail in Germany or elsewhere, or\r\nprevail at least in a much milder degree. But there was another side to\r\nMarx. It would not be fair to call it his opportunist side. On this side\r\nMarx had regard to his environment, as every man must have. Even in the\r\ncommunistic manifesto Marx recommended co-operation with other advanced\r\nparties for the attainment of democratic ends. He recognised the\r\npossibilities of progress contained in a peaceful evolution. Factory\r\nlegislation and the co-operative movement in England were not only good\r\nresults, they were the victories of new principles. As we have seen, he\r\nbelieved that in America, England, and Holland the workmen might attain\r\ntheir goal by peaceful means. In a milder time it would only be\r\nconsistent that this milder side of Marx should be more emphasised by\r\nhis followers.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for a criticism of Marx as a condition of the further\r\ndevelopment of his teaching has recently been pointed out by Eduard\r\nBernstein, formerly editor of the _Sozialdemokrat_. This criticism he\r\nattempted in a memorial addressed to the Congress at Stuttgart, and more\r\nfully in 1899 in a book _Die Voraussetzungen des Sozialismus und die\r\nAufgaben der Sozialdemocratie_. Bernstein’s criticism is applied more or\r\nless to all the leading positions of Marx, his materialistic conception\r\nof history, his dialectical method, his theory of surplus value, his\r\nrevolutionary conception of social development which looks forward to a\r\ngreat catastrophe as the close of the capitalistic era. He maintains\r\nthat statistics do not favour the theory that a social catastrophe is\r\nimminent as the result of a class war carried on by a continually\r\nincreasing host of impoverished and degraded proletarians against a\r\ndiminishing band of the colossal magnates of capitalism, and has greater\r\nfaith in a peaceful evolution through the democratic transformation of\r\nthe State, the extension of municipal socialism and of the co-operative\r\nmovement. We need not say that we believe that these criticisms are in\r\nthe right direction.\r\n\r\nBernstein’s book made a great stir in Germany, and received a limited\r\nsupport at the Hanover meeting. But a resolution, which was moved by\r\nBebel in a long and able speech, and which affirmed the old positions of\r\nthe party against Bernstein, was carried by an overwhelming majority.\r\n\r\nThe abstract collectivism of the German Social Democratic party is not\r\nfitted to ensure success among the peasantry. Yet at the election of\r\n1898 they gained ground in many agricultural districts east of the Elbe.\r\nWe may presume that these results were obtained chiefly among the purely\r\nlabouring class as distinguished from the men who own their farms. But\r\nthey do not despair of also winning over the peasant owners, many of\r\nwhom are heavily burdened with mortgages. The peasant owner is often\r\nproprietor only in name, being really caretaker for the mortgagee, and\r\ntherefore merely a dependent of the capitalist.\r\n\r\nAll previous successes of the German Social Democrats were eclipsed by\r\nthe triumph at the general election of 1903, when they counted 3,010,000\r\nvotes, and returned 81 members. Of the entire poll they had 32 per cent,\r\nor nearly one-third. It was an increase of 900,000.\r\n\r\nThe number of their seats in the Reichstag never correspond to their\r\nvotes at the elections. There has been no Redistribution Act since the\r\nfounding of the Empire, and the strength of the party lies in the towns,\r\nwhich have grown enormously since 1871. Even under the most favourable\r\ncircumstances they have little direct influence on the legislation of\r\nGermany, and still less on the executive, which depends on the Emperor\r\nand his ministers. The rôle prescribed to them by their circumstances is\r\nvigilant scrutiny and outspoken criticism. They are an opposition party.\r\nIn fact, they are more and more becoming the only effective opposition\r\nparty in Germany.\r\n\r\nAt the Jena meeting of 1905 the bust of Liebknecht, who died in 1900,\r\nheld a place of honour on the platform beside those of Marx and\r\nLassalle. Changes of organisation aiming at greater energy and\r\nefficiency were introduced. This meeting elected a party direction\r\n(_Parteivorstand_) of two chairmen, four secretaries and a treasurer,\r\nwith the two assessors chosen by the Board of Control. It thus consisted\r\nof nine members. The Board of Control, which acts as check on this\r\nexecutive, also numbers nine members. Among the subjects discussed were\r\nthe dearness of meat and other necessaries of life caused by the German\r\nprotective system, and the question of the general strike, introduced in\r\na masterly speech by Bebel, who advocated it as a possible resource in\r\ncase universal suffrage be withdrawn, or the right of combination be\r\ninfringed by the Government. A resolution in this sense was in principle\r\nadopted by a very large majority. It was confirmed at the Mannheim\r\nmeeting in 1906.\r\n\r\nThe German Social Democrats do not insist on universal suffrage in the\r\nhope of exercising any immediate influence on the Government or in the\r\nReichstag. They regard it rather as an instrument of agitation and\r\neducation. They seek to enlighten the masses of the people, to make them\r\nof one mind on the political and economic questions that concern them,\r\nto organise and discipline them for the great task of emancipation.\r\nTheir main field of action is the people, not parliament. Their ‘main\r\naim is to win the whole working class for socialism.’\r\n\r\nIn this aim their prospect of success depends on how far they can win\r\nover the Catholic working men and the rural population. With both they\r\nhave so far gained ground. It is not impossible that they may in time\r\nprevail with both. In their principles and tactics there is nothing now\r\nthat need give offence to the religious convictions of the Catholic\r\nelectors. The rural population could be won over by a suitable agrarian\r\nprogramme. In these circumstances the Centre and the Conservatives would\r\nalike have the ground taken away from under their feet, and the German\r\nGovernment would find itself in an untenable position. For in such a\r\ncase the army could hardly continue to be a trustworthy support. The\r\nfollowing significant passage occurs in the speech of Bebel already\r\nreferred to:—‘The struggle in Russia sends a chill into the\r\nmarrow-bones of our rulers much more than you believe. They have a\r\ndeadly fear that the fire may cross the border. They say to themselves,\r\nif that is possible in Russia where there is no organisation, and the\r\nproletariat is comparatively small, what then may happen in Germany\r\nwhere we have politically enlightened masses and an organised\r\nproletariat, where already there are not only battalions but whole\r\nregiments in the army which consist of Social Democrats, and when the\r\nReserve and the Landwehr are called out, whole brigades are formed of\r\nthem?’[1] The raising of the tariff has been to the party a most helpful\r\nsubject of agitation, which they have used to the uttermost. Molkenbuhr,\r\none of their leaders, looks forward to the doubling of their adherents\r\nin a few years.\r\n\r\nAt the general election of 1907 the party had 3,260,000 votes, but owing\r\nto the more active combination against it of other parties it returned\r\nonly 43 members. The congress at Nürnberg in 1908 was notable for the\r\nfirst serious opposition to the rigid discipline of the party. The claim\r\nof the South German members to vote for the budgets of their governments\r\nwas maintained by a minority of 119 against 258.\r\n\r\nIt was not till 1894 that a Social Democratic party was founded in\r\nHolland. It is making progress: in the general election of 1897 it\r\ncounted 13,000 votes, and returned 3 members out of 100. In 1901 it had\r\n38,000 votes, and returned 7 members, and there was besides an\r\nindependent socialist member. It had 65,000 votes and 7 members in 1905.\r\nAn interesting feature of the Dutch movement is the sympathetic\r\nreception which socialism has met among the artist and intellectual\r\nclass generally. It is curious that anarchism has had considerable\r\ninfluence, which, however, is declining.\r\n\r\nIn Denmark the social democratic movement began in 1871, and it\r\ncontinues to have a strong and growing influence. At the general\r\nelection of 1903 the party returned 16 members out of 114, polling\r\n56,000 votes. In 1906 it polled 77,000 votes and returned 24 members to\r\nthe popular chamber. For some time before 1902 half of the members of\r\nthe municipal council of Copenhagen were socialists. The mayor also was\r\none of the party. Denmark may still rightfully be regarded as the most\r\nprogressive country in Europe. Even in Norway and Sweden the socialists\r\nare gaining ground. They claim to have wielded a considerable influence\r\nin securing the peaceful separation of the two countries.\r\n\r\nNo country in Europe has during recent years had a more interesting\r\nsocial history than Belgium. In hardly any country has the working class\r\nendured such misery. Ignorance, long hours of labour and low wages, the\r\nwant of political rights and of organisation, have for generations\r\ntended to keep the workers in the lowest estate. All the more\r\nremarkable, therefore, is the awakening which has recently taken place.\r\nThe Belgian socialist party can now muster at the polls a voting\r\nstrength of about half a million, and in a chamber of 166 it returns\r\nabout one-fifth. In 1900 it had 33, in 1902 it had 34, in 1904 only 28,\r\nin 1906 it had 30, and 34 in 1908. The organisation of the trade-unions\r\nis well developed. But the distinctive feature of the social movement of\r\nBelgium is its co-operative undertakings. These are affiliated to the\r\nsocialist movement, and form an admirable training on its more practical\r\nside. The Belgian socialist party is specially fortunate in such leaders\r\nas Anseele and Vandervelde.\r\n\r\nFrance, which was so long the foremost nation in the revolutionary\r\nmovement, has for the last three decades yielded the first place to\r\nGermany. The terrible disasters sustained by the working men of Paris in\r\n1848 and 1871 quelled their revolutionary energy for a time. The first\r\nworking men’s congress after the Commune met in 1876, and at the\r\ncongress of Marseilles in 1879 a socialist party was organised. It\r\nremained a united party till 1882, when it polled 98,000 votes. Since\r\nthat year French socialism has been fruitful in division. In view of the\r\ndanger which in 1899 appeared to threaten the Republic in connection\r\nwith the Dreyfus case, the socialist parties combined in common action\r\nfor its defence. For this purpose they formed a permanent _comité\r\nd’entente socialiste_. Five important socialist organisations were\r\nincluded in the agreement. The good understanding was broken when the\r\nsocialist Millerand entered the emergency Cabinet of that year. Without\r\ngoing into details, it is enough to say that there have been two main\r\ntendencies in French socialism—the uncompromising revolutionary school\r\nwhich adheres to Marx, and an opportunist or _possibilist_ school which\r\nhas been ready to co-operate with other democratic parties. The\r\nfirst-named school naturally objected to Millerand entering the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nSocialism is rapidly becoming a power in France. According to M. Marcel\r\nFournier, in the _Revue Politique et Parlementaire_, the radical\r\nsocialists polled 171,810 votes at the general election of 1893 and\r\n629,572 at that of 1898, whilst the socialists polled 598,206 in 1893\r\nand 791,148 in 1898. The _Parti Ouvrier_ or Marx party claimed to have\r\ncast 152,000 votes in 1893 and 371,000 in 1898. The socialist members in\r\nthe Chamber of 1898 numbered about fifty.\r\n\r\nAfter 1900 two distinct parties, representing the two tendencies of\r\nwhich I have spoken, were for a time consolidated. The Socialist Party\r\nof France represented the uncompromising section. The French Socialist\r\nParty stood for the more opportunist policy. In 1902 the French\r\nsocialists together polled 805,000 votes, and returned 48 members to the\r\nChamber of Deputies. There was really very little difference between the\r\ntwo leading parties, and they formed a union in 1905. At the general\r\nelection in 1906 it was calculated that the whole socialist vote\r\namounted to 1,120,000. The unified party returned 52 members with\r\n896,000 votes, while 23 were described as independent socialists. There\r\nwere besides 143 radical socialists.\r\n\r\nThe radical and democratic republicans are to a large degree dependent\r\non labour and socialist support. There is also a growing conviction that\r\nthe political principles of the Revolution of 1789, which are so dear to\r\nthe French heart, cannot be realised apart from the economic principles\r\nwhich are comprehended in socialism. In the great debate of Clemenceau\r\nwith Jaurèz in the Chamber in 1906 it was no impassable gulf which\r\nseparated radical and socialist. The former was in favour of a graduated\r\nincome-tax, the eight hours’ day, and the restoration of monopolies to\r\nthe State. What we may call the prevailing republican atmosphere is most\r\nfavourable to social justice and the claims of labour. But it would be a\r\nvery serious mistake to believe that France is at all convinced of the\r\nreasonableness or practicability of the abstract collectivism of the\r\nsocialist party. When a motion for the substitution of collective\r\nproperty for individual property was put to the vote at the close of the\r\ndebate, it was rejected by 505 to only 55. As at present advised, France\r\nwill have neither clericalism nor collectivism.\r\n\r\nThe socialists form a majority in many of the most important French\r\ncommunes, and exercise great practical influence on their work. Thus\r\nthey are taking a large part in the national and local life of France.\r\n\r\nRevolutionary feeling tending to anarchism has considerable influence in\r\nFrance, especially among the trade unions (_syndicats ouvriers_).\r\n\r\nThe Italian socialist party definitely separated itself from anarchism\r\nand formed a distinct organisation at a congress in Genoa in 1892. Its\r\ncareer has been a hard and troubled one. There has been much discord in\r\nits own household. The government was for some years openly hostile. It\r\nhas been concerned in many strikes and popular disturbances. The working\r\nclasses of Italy, we must remember, were from an educational, economic,\r\nand political point of view at an inferior stage of progress. Between\r\nthe various provinces, and especially between the north and south, the\r\ndifferences of development were very serious. Italy has had long to\r\nsuffer from the burden of a divided and depressed historical past.\r\n\r\nAt the general election of 1892 the party had only 26,000 votes and\r\nreturned 6 deputies. The next elections showed a rapid increase, till in\r\n1900 they counted 175,000 votes and returned 32 members to the Chamber.\r\nOn that occasion an alliance with the radicals and republicans partly\r\naccounted for the increase of members returned. At the general election\r\nof 1904 the party had a voting strength of 320,000, but returned only 27\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nFor some time after 1900 the Government was not only sympathetic, but in\r\nsome degree dependent on the party for support. As in other countries,\r\nthere is a reformist or moderate and a revolutionary wing in the Italian\r\nsocialist party. The latter takes a _syndicalist_ or trade-union form\r\nand is largely imbued with anarchism. At the congress at Rome in 1906 a\r\nnew movement called _integralism_ became supreme. The integralists aimed\r\nat combining the best and most effective methods of all sections,\r\ngradual reform when possible, but violence also, and the general strike\r\nif necessary. They are anti-monarchical and anti-clerical.\r\n\r\nThe Italian socialists have been active not only in organising strikes\r\nbut in municipal work and in co-operative undertakings. A marked feature\r\nin the brief history of the party has been its success in organising the\r\npeasantry. One of these peasant combinations, with a membership of\r\n200,000, held a national congress at Bologna in 1901 and formed a\r\nnational federation. In that and the following year many agrarian\r\nstrikes were successful, and brought a little improvement in the hard\r\nlot of the rural workers in Italy. It was a notable awakening of labour,\r\nin which the party took a leading share. When we consider the very\r\nbackward condition of Italy and the short period during which the party\r\nhas been in existence, we must regard its success as remarkable.\r\n\r\nAfter making some progress the Working-Men’s Socialist Party of Spain\r\nhas declined in recent years. The number of its votes for the Chamber\r\ndecreased from 26,000 in 1904 to 23,000 in 1905. It has, however,\r\nsucceeded in sending representatives to a good number of municipalities\r\nand communes. The political and industrial life of Spain has been in a\r\nmost depressed condition.\r\n\r\nBesides the Parliamentary Socialism, which is based more or less on\r\nMarx, anarchism has always found a congenial soil in Spain, Italy, and\r\nother countries where misery and oppression have been hereditary for so\r\nmany centuries, and which even yet have not learned habits of\r\nself-control, of free discussion, and open action. It is such an unhappy\r\nenvironment that produced the assassins of President Carnot, the Empress\r\nof Austria, and King Humbert of Italy. Anarchism is very powerful and\r\nwidespread in the south of Spain.\r\n\r\nWe may note a rapid progress of socialism in Eastern Europe. Even Servia\r\nand Bulgaria have socialist parties, which are affiliated to the\r\nInternational. In Austria there is a numerous and active Social\r\nDemocratic Party, which has introduced the federal principle into its\r\norganisation. It is a united party with a common programme and tactics,\r\nbut it is composed of national groups—German, Czech, Polish, Italian,\r\netc., each of which enjoys a real autonomy. In fact, the party is an\r\nInternational on a small scale, of which the basis as regards principles\r\nand tactics is national autonomy and international solidarity. On the\r\npolitical side, it holds that the real and vital forces of the State in\r\nAustria can be developed only on the two principles of national autonomy\r\nand complete democracy. On the economic side the party adheres to the\r\ncommon principles of socialism. At the general election of 1901 the\r\nparty polled about 800,000 votes. Its most pressing demand was for\r\nuniversal suffrage as necessary to the political development of the\r\ncountry. After long debate this was granted in 1907, in which year the\r\nparty polled 1,050,000 votes and returned 87 members to the Reichsrath.\r\nThe Christian Social Party returned 96 members with 722,000 votes. In\r\nview of the medley of races and languages which exist in Austria, the\r\nposition and organisation of the party have a special interest. The\r\nvarious national groups, we are told, work together in perfect harmony.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary movement in Russia had in 1881 its tragic culmination\r\nin the assassination of the Emperor Alexander II. Though his successor\r\nAlexander III. was for a time kept a prisoner in his palace at Gatschina\r\nby fear of the revolutionists, the movement was suppressed, and for\r\nseveral years there was comparative quiet. Among the innovating party a\r\nfeeling set in that they had been trying to force the march of natural\r\nevolution, and a tendency prevailed to await the time when the economic\r\ndevelopment of the country would make revolutionary action practicable.\r\nUnder a very high tariff the industrial revolution made rapid progress.\r\nLarge factories soon led to the creation of a numerous proletariat, with\r\nthe usual strikes. A gigantic strike at St. Petersburg in 1896 may be\r\nregarded as the starting-point of a new revolutionary movement arising\r\nnaturally out of modern industrial conditions. A Social Democratic\r\nParty, which laid great emphasis on the doctrines of Marx, originated in\r\nthis way. The Russian socialists were for the first time represented at\r\nan International Congress in London, 1896.\r\n\r\nGroups of socialists, however, had been rising up and taking shape all\r\nover the country, and it was felt by many that they could not wait for\r\nthe unfolding of the economic evolution, and that in the special\r\ncircumstances of Russia a strenuous revolutionary action was necessary.\r\nSome surviving members of the old revolutionary party helped to supply\r\nthe nucleus of a Socialist Revolutionary Party, which was accordingly\r\nformed towards the end of 1901. There were now two important socialist\r\nparties in the empire: the Social Democrats, who emphasised the need for\r\nawaiting the economic development of Russia, including the full creation\r\nof the proletariat, and the Socialist Revolutionary Party. The first\r\nparty had little hope of leading the peasantry into the movement, so\r\nlong as they were not expropriated by the growth of the great estates.\r\nThe second party insisted on an energetic propaganda among the peasantry\r\nas well as an active campaign against the Tzardom and its servants.\r\n\r\nBesides these two parties we find in Lithuania, Russian Poland, and\r\nother parts of Western Russia, a socialist organisation of Jewish\r\nworkmen called the Bund. It is the peculiar fate of the Jews in Russia\r\nthat their revolutionary activity renders them obnoxious to the\r\nGovernment, whilst the exactions of the usurers and dealers of the same\r\nrace make them hateful to peasantry and workers. The Jewish question in\r\nRussia can be understood only by due recognition of both points.\r\n\r\nThe anarchists also are still active in Russia. And among the peasantry\r\nthere is an agrarian movement, which may be regarded as the most\r\npowerful of all, though vague and ill-organised. As we saw in our\r\nchapter on anarchism, the revolution in Russia was an exotic or\r\nimportation from abroad in the reign of Alexander II. It has now taken\r\nroot in the soil and very strongly shows the influence of conditions\r\npeculiar to the country. Mutinies in fleet and army, strikes and popular\r\nrisings, massacres, assassinations, conflagration, and pillage seem to\r\nportend the dissolution sooner or later of an ancient society and a\r\nlong-established autocracy. The socialists have been the most active\r\nagents in the appalling movement.\r\n\r\nAfter the decline of the Owen agitation and of the Christian Socialist\r\nmovement in 1850, socialism could hardly be said to exist in England,\r\nand where it attracted any attention at all, it was generally regarded\r\nas a revolutionary curiosity peculiar to the Continent, with little\r\npractical interest for a free and normal country like our own. As we\r\nhave seen, the English workmen took a considerable share in the founding\r\nof the International in 1864 and subsequently. But on the fuller\r\ndevelopment of the revolutionary tendencies of that movement, and\r\nespecially after the great disaster of the Commune at Paris, socialism\r\nlost the not very serious hold which it had found among the English\r\nworking class. There had indeed always been a group of men who were\r\ninfluenced by personal intercourse with Karl Marx and Engels during\r\ntheir long residence in this country, but they were mostly of foreign\r\nextraction, and had no wide relations with the English workmen.\r\n\r\nAbout 1883 English socialism took a fresh start, indirectly through the\r\ninfluence of Henry George, and directly through the teaching of Karl\r\nMarx. By his vigorous and sympathetic eloquence Henry George gained a\r\nhearing for opinions which were not distinctly socialistic, but\r\ncertainly tended to disturb the existing modes of thought. Though it led\r\nto little positive result, the agitation connected with his name was\r\nreally the beginning of a radical change in English economics. A variety\r\nof causes, among which we may mention the agrarian agitation in Ireland,\r\nand the legislation which was designed to meet it, had contributed to\r\nshake the confidence of the English public in the finality of the\r\naccepted economic doctrines.\r\n\r\nThe recent English socialism had, in 1884, a definite beginning with the\r\nSocial Democratic Federation, which, with great fervour, denounced the\r\nexisting system and proclaimed the views of Marx. Most active and\r\nprominent in this movement was Mr. Hyndman; the most eminent was the\r\nrobust and genial figure of William Morris, widely known as the author\r\nof the _Earthly Paradise_, and one of the foremost of living poets. The\r\nchief literary product of the movement at this early stage was Hyndman’s\r\n_Historical Basis of Socialism in England_. The organ of the Federation\r\nwas, and continues to be, _Justice_.\r\n\r\nAbout the end of the year 1885 the Socialist League diverged from the\r\nFederation on grounds of difference, which were partly personal, partly\r\nof principle, for the League showed a decided sympathy with the\r\nanarchist theory of socialism. Morris himself, its leading member, had\r\nanarchist leanings, which come out clearly in _News from Nowhere_ and\r\nother works. Belfort Bax, another prominent member of the League, has\r\npublished _Ethics of Socialism_ and other works, which represent the\r\nextreme and uncompromising side of the movement. The _Commonweal_ was\r\nthe organ of the League. The League and its organ, however, did not\r\nsurvive many years.\r\n\r\nThe year 1884 also saw the beginning of a Socialist Society of a nature\r\ndifferent from the above. This was the Fabian Society, whose members\r\nwere mostly young men, clever, full of initiative, and little disposed\r\nto bow before accepted authority. They are socialists whose aim has been\r\nfirst to educate themselves in the economic, social, and political\r\nquestions of the time, and then to educate the English people in their\r\nviews, or, to use their own language, to “permeate” English Society with\r\nprogressive socialist ideas. _The Fabian Essays on Socialism_, by seven\r\nof its leading members, published in 1890, a work which has been the\r\nchief literary product of the Society, have had a great success. By its\r\npopular lectures and discussions, by its tracts and its articles in the\r\nmonthly reviews, as well as by its activity in the press, the Fabian\r\nSociety has undoubtedly done much toward the permeation of public\r\nopinion with a progressive evolutionary socialism. The tracts, of which\r\nthere is now a large number, have been always able, generally well\r\ninformed, and often brilliant. A tract by one of its members on the\r\nWorkmen’s Compensation Act, issued in 1898, had a circulation of 120,000\r\nthe first year of its publication. Important works on a large scale have\r\nbeen _The History of Trade Unionism_ and _Industrial Democracy_ by Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Sidney Webb. The writings of Mr. G. B. Shaw and of Mr. H. G.\r\nWells have done much to startle men’s minds out of the old way of\r\nthinking. In 1908 the membership of the Fabian Society had increased to\r\n2500 in the London society, and 500 more in local societies. We give its\r\nBasis in the Appendix.\r\n\r\nThe Independent Labour Party, formed in 1893, was an organisation of\r\nsocialists with a view to political action. It was to a large extent an\r\noffshoot from Fabianism in the provinces, and many of its leading\r\nmembers are Fabians. It has kept itself in close touch with trade\r\nunions.\r\n\r\nAll sections of recent English socialism have included men of real\r\nability and culture, and the movement has been marked by sincere\r\nconviction, generous enthusiasm, and hard work in a great cause. For\r\nsome years after its rise, in 1883, it had considerable influence in the\r\ncountry. Its mission was to rouse men of all classes out of the\r\nindividualistic routine which had so long been prevalent. Trade\r\nunionists and co-operators were the objects of denunciation not less\r\nunsparing than that which they poured upon the middle class. The\r\ndisturbances in Trafalgar Square in 1887 made no little stir; and the\r\nDock Strike in London, which was so ably conducted by John Burns in\r\n1889, for a time gave the movement a national importance. It almost\r\nseemed at one period as if English public opinion was veering round to\r\nSocialism. The reaction which was bound to set in was certainly due in\r\npart to the vehemence and extravagance of the socialistic orators, and\r\nto their want of skill and insight in adapting their theories to the\r\natmosphere of the English mind. It is clear that recent English\r\nsocialism has been too loyal to Marx. This particularly applies to the\r\nSocial Democratic Federation, now the Social Democratic Party. But even\r\nthe Fabian basis has implications which are ultra-revolutionary, and\r\nhardly consistent with a peaceful and orderly evolution.\r\n\r\nAt the general election of 1895, the organised socialism in England\r\npolled only about 45,000 votes. The mass of the English working men\r\nstill voted with the old political parties. On the other hand, the Trade\r\nUnion Congresses, representing over a million workers, for several years\r\npassed resolutions of a collectivist nature by large majorities, showing\r\nthat when the man or men appear that know how to give voice and form to\r\nthe half-articulate or latent socialism of the country it may have a\r\ngreat future.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 steps were taken towards the political organisation of labour on\r\na wider scale than formerly. There was formed a Labour Representation\r\nCommittee in which trade unions, the Independent Labour Party, the\r\nSocial Democratic Federation, and the Fabian Society were represented.\r\nThe Social Democratic Federation retired, however, at the end of the\r\nfirst year.\r\n\r\nThe new committee had been too recently formed to take much part in the\r\ngeneral election of 1900. Yet it then returned two members, and two more\r\nat subsequent by-elections. At the general election of 1906 it had a\r\ngreat success, and produced an impression even greater on the national\r\nmind. As there was no definite dividing line at the election between\r\nsocialism and labour on the one hand, or between labour and liberalism\r\non the other, it is impossible to speak precisely as to the results. The\r\ncommittee had 323,000 votes and returned 30 members to the House of\r\nCommons. There was also a labour or trade-union group, which formed part\r\nof the Liberal Party. We may reckon the labour members at 54, of whom\r\nabout half were socialists.\r\n\r\nAfter the election the Labour Representation Committee transformed\r\nitself into the Labour Party, and very wisely decided not to formulate a\r\nprogramme. The new party had behind it a million adherents, of whom\r\n21,000 were members of socialist societies, the rest being trade\r\nunionists. Mr. Keir Hardie had taken the leading share in the formation\r\nof a Labour Party distinct from the old political parties. In 1908 the\r\ntrade unions and especially the Miners’ Federation which were\r\nrepresented by the liberal-labour group resolved to join the Labour\r\nParty, but this decision was not to be operative with regard to sitting\r\nmembers during the existing parliament. The same year the Labour Party\r\nwas definitely affiliated to the International. It now represented one\r\nand a half million of adherents.\r\n\r\nThe Labour Party, whose origin we have briefly described, may fairly be\r\nregarded as a successful attempt on a worthy scale to form a\r\nlabour-socialist organisation suited to British conditions. It appears\r\nto be commendably free from the excessive Marx influence; but in many\r\nimportant questions it has not thrown off old radical views which are\r\ninconsistent with a reasonable and enlightened socialism.\r\n\r\nWhat we may call the avowed and organised socialism has made no great\r\nheadway in the United States of America or in the English colonies.\r\nBooks like Bellamy’s _Looking Backward_ have made a great impression,\r\nbut in a vague way. Labour questions have, on the other hand, attained\r\nto a very high state of development. The struggle between trade-unionism\r\nand the employers’ combinations is carried on with an energy and\r\ncomprehensiveness which can hardly be equalled in any part of the old\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAustralia has a Labour Party which is well organised and well led and\r\ntakes a most honourable place in the recently constituted Commonwealth.\r\nIt even formed the government in 1904, though it did not retain power\r\nlong. It is, however, most powerful when out of power, as it then holds\r\nthe balance between the other two parties. The party is to a great\r\ndegree socialistic in aim and tendency. It was in power again in 1908.\r\n\r\nDuring recent years we have seen in America a transformation which is\r\nwithout parallel in the history of the world. Till the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century the United States might be described as an\r\nagricultural country, which, apart from negro slavery, had no division\r\nof classes, no poverty, and no social question. It was a highly favoured\r\nregion which to the most energetic and enterprising of the working\r\nclasses of Europe had for generations been a Land of Promise. The early\r\nsettlers had in the main brought from England all that was best and\r\nhighest in respect of character, belief, and institutions. In\r\nparticular, for the planting of New England the “finest of the wheat”\r\nwas sifted from the most progressive counties of England; and as the\r\narea of emigration widened it embraced the best elements in the British\r\nIsles and in north-western Europe, the best endowed and the most\r\nprogressive in the world. The country they came to live in had\r\nresources, and offered opportunities which were almost boundless. In the\r\ndevelopment of the country from the first settlement of Virginia, there\r\nwas just enough of difficulty to stimulate and correct the energies of a\r\nfree people.\r\n\r\nA marvellous set of new conditions came into operation in the latter\r\nhalf of the nineteenth century. The industrial revolution ran its course\r\nwith astonishing rapidity and thoroughness, and on a scale absolutely\r\nunprecedented. The Republic now has a gigantic machine industry and a\r\nvast railway and financial system organised in trusts which are\r\ncontrolled by a few men wealthy beyond example in history, and it has\r\nalso got a large wage-earning class, the unemployed, poverty and slums.\r\nIf the commonwealth has not already become a plutocracy, it appears to\r\nbe on the downward way to it.\r\n\r\nIf the wage-earning class consisted of fully trained American citizens,\r\nthe situation would be clearer. It is complicated by the fact that for\r\nmany years the Republic has received an enormous number of immigrants\r\nfrom the less-advanced countries of eastern and southern Europe, and has\r\nthe very difficult task of raising them to its own high standard of\r\ncitizenship. The general result is that America is confronted with the\r\nvast problem, which socialism has undertaken to solve, in its most\r\nformidable form. Between a highly organised and gigantic capitalism and\r\na continually increasing labour class which is largely composed of new\r\nimmigrants, and is only partially organised, a wide gulf is fixed. A\r\ngrowing chasm threatens to divide the commonwealth in two. This rent is\r\nmade manifest in the strikes, which degenerate into private war and even\r\ninto civil war. Socialists maintain that they have been repressed with a\r\nseverity and brutality known in Russia alone. As yet the organised\r\nsocialism has made only moderate progress. In 1902, however, a\r\nresolution in favour of socialism obtained about half the votes at the\r\ncongress of the American Federation of Labour, which numbered over\r\n2,000,000 members. At the presidential election of 1904 the socialist\r\ncandidate Eugène V. Debs received 408,000 votes, in 1908 he had 500,000\r\nvotes. It was widely recognised that the presidential election of 1908\r\nturned on the vote of organised labour. The Republican and Democratic\r\ncandidates both made special appeal to organised labour and made a\r\nspecial effort to gain its vote. It is obvious that the gigantic growth\r\nof the trust system in America has quickened inquiry into the most\r\nfundamental questions of industrial and social order. The programme of\r\nthe Knights of Labour was for many years the nearest approach to\r\nsocialism made by any great labour combination in America. But there can\r\nbe no doubt now that America contains all the elements which favour the\r\ngrowth of socialism, and especially of the labour organisations which\r\nmake for socialism.\r\n\r\nThe result of our brief review is, that in most countries of Europe the\r\navowed and organised socialism has a formidable and rapidly increasing\r\nnumber of adherents. It is equally clear that socialistic theories have\r\nmade a wide and deep impression on the opinion of most countries of the\r\ncivilised world. Socialism has been a standing challenge to the economic\r\ntheories so long prevalent: it is a protest against the existing\r\nsocial-economic order; and as such it has been discussed on every\r\nplatform, in all journals, and we may venture to say in every private\r\ngathering, with some comprehension of its nature and aims. Whatever the\r\nissue may be, it is very improbable that reasonable men can ever again\r\nregard the competitive system of economics with the same satisfaction as\r\nformerly. The mere fact that we can survey and analyse great ideas and\r\ninstitutions with critical objectiveness is a proof that we are looking\r\nback upon them, and that we have already so far left them behind in the\r\nonward march of progress. In countries where the socialistic theory is\r\naccepted in its entirety only by a few, it has nevertheless effected a\r\ngreat change in opinion. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the\r\northodox political economy, if it exist anywhere, survives only in old\r\nbooks and in the minds of a diminishing band of doctrinaires. Friends of\r\nthe existing order would now almost have us believe that the old\r\ncompetitive political economy never existed at all, which at least may\r\nbe taken as a sufficient proof that its days are numbered. Under these\r\ncircumstances it is not surprising that we do not at present possess a\r\nsettled political economy.\r\n\r\nWe may best consider the growing influence of socialistic ideas on\r\ncurrent opinion under the following heads:—\r\n\r\n1. On the theory of the State’s relation to labour.—The attitude of\r\nmost governments to the organised socialism is naturally unfriendly; but\r\nthe accepted view of the relation of the State to the working and\r\nsuffering classes has marvellously changed in recent years. Whereas not\r\nmany years ago the policy and principles of government took little\r\naccount of the masses of the people, it is now a recognised duty of the\r\nState to care for them. So complete has the transformation been, that it\r\nwill soon require a considerable knowledge of history to realise it, for\r\nthe times when the claims of the lower orders were ignored are already\r\nbeginning to pass out of the memory of the younger and most active\r\nportion of the community.\r\n\r\n2. The relation of political economy to socialism.—We have already\r\nreferred to the influence of social problems on the classical political\r\neconomy of this country. The development of J. S. Mill’s economic views\r\nfrom loyal adherence to Ricardo, to a reasonable socialism, cannot be\r\nregarded as representative, seeing that he has so entirely outstripped\r\nhis scholars. In recent important works on economics we see indeed only\r\na moderate recognition of the new influences, but they do not command\r\nthe assent of the public as formerly, the result being that English\r\nPolitical Economy remains in a most unsettled problematical and\r\nunsatisfactory condition.\r\n\r\nHere again Germany leads the way. The socialism of the chair is not to\r\nany large extent really socialistic. But it includes among its\r\nrepresentatives eminent professors and other economists, who recognise\r\nthe historical and ethical sides of political economy, who go far in\r\ngiving labour problems their due place in the treatment of their\r\nsubject, and who have made most important concessions to the socialistic\r\ncriticism of the existing society and the prevalent political economy.\r\nOne of the most notable of living German economists and sociologists,\r\nAlbert Schäffle, is more than historical; his great work _Bau und Leben\r\ndes socialen Körpers_ is a construction of society from the evolution\r\npoint of view. In the same work he has even expressed his conviction\r\nthat ‘the future belongs to the purified socialism,’ though later\r\nutterances make his attitude somewhat doubtful. However that may be, he\r\nhas brought to the study of social problems a combination of learning,\r\nof philosophic insight directed by the best light of his time, and of\r\nsympathy inspired by the cause of the poor man, which is not equalled by\r\nany living economist. No great living economist has been so powerfully\r\ninfluenced by socialist speculation.\r\n\r\n3. The relation of the Christian Church to socialism.—It is a most\r\nserious mistake to suppose that there can be any real antagonism between\r\nthe ethical and spiritual teaching of Christianity and the principles of\r\nsocialism rightly understood. The difficulty is how to reconcile the\r\nprevalent competitive system with any reasonable conception of Christian\r\nethics. We can now see that Christianity was a strong assertion of the\r\nmoral and spiritual forces against the struggle for existence, which had\r\nassumed such a hard, cruel, and vicious form in ancient civilisation and\r\nin the Roman world. The Christian Church did much to soften and then to\r\nabolish slavery and serfdom, into which the peoples defeated in the\r\nstruggle for existence had been forced. A right comprehension of the\r\nChristian life and of the spirit and tendency of Christian history\r\nshould show that the Church should also use its influence against the\r\ncontinuance of the struggle for existence in the competitive system, and\r\nin favour of the less fortunate who in the course of that form of\r\nstruggle have been driven to precarious wage-labour as their only means\r\nof livelihood.\r\n\r\nSome of the prominent spokesmen of the Church have clearly seen that the\r\ncompetitive system is not consistent with Christian teaching. As we have\r\nalready seen, Maurice and Kingsley denounced the Manchester school,\r\nstarted the Christian Socialist movement of 1848, and gave a very\r\nconsiderable impetus to co-operation.\r\n\r\nThe participation of the Catholic Church of Germany in the social\r\nquestion dates from the period of the Lassalle agitation. In 1863\r\nDöllinger recommended that the Church should intervene in the movement,\r\nand Bishop von Ketteler of Mainz lost no time in expressing sympathy\r\nwith Lassalle. In a treatise entitled _Die Arbeiterfrage und das\r\nChristenthum_ (1864) Ketteler criticised the liberalism of the\r\nManchester school in substantially the same terms as Lassalle, and\r\nrecommended the voluntary formation of productive associations with\r\ncapital supplied by the faithful. In 1868 the Catholic Socialism of\r\nGermany took a more practical form: it started an organ of its own and\r\nbegan to organise unions for the elevation of the working men. The\r\nprinciples of the movement were with some precision expounded by Canon\r\nMoufang in an electoral address at Mainz in 1871, and by the writers in\r\ntheir organ.\r\n\r\nAll agree in condemning the principles of liberalism, especially in its\r\neconomic aspects, as destructive of society and pernicious to the\r\nworking man, who, under the pretence of freedom, is exposed to all the\r\nprecariousness and anarchy of competition and sacrificed to the Iron Law\r\nof Wages. Self-help as practised in the Schulze-Delitzsch schemes is\r\nalso considered to be no sure way of deliverance. The general remedy is\r\nunion on Catholic principles, especially the formation of trade-guilds\r\nsuited to modern exigencies, which some of their leaders would make a\r\ncompulsory measure enforced by the State. The views of Moufang, which\r\nare most definite, may thus be summarised: legal protection for the\r\nworkers, especially as regards hours of labour, wages, the labour of\r\nwomen and children, sanitation; subventions for workmen’s productive\r\nassociations; lightening of taxes on labour; control of the moneyed and\r\nspeculating interests. In the organisation of unions the success of\r\nCatholic Socialism has been great; and for several years the Social\r\nDemocrats made no progress in Catholic districts.\r\n\r\nThe socialist activity of the Protestant Church of Germany dates from\r\n1878. The most important literary product of the movement is a work by\r\nPastor Todt entitled _Der radikale deutsche Socialismus und die\r\nchristliche Gesellschaft_. In this work Todt condemns the economics of\r\nliberalism as unchristian, and seeks to show that the ideals of liberty,\r\nequality, and fraternity are entirely Scriptural, as are also the\r\nsocialist demands for the abolition of private property and of the wage\r\nsystem, that the labourer should have the full produce of his labour,\r\nand that labour should be associated. The chief leader of the movement\r\nwas the Court preacher Stöcker, the head also of the anti-Semitic\r\nagitation, which is largely traceable to economic causes. Stöcker\r\nfounded two associations—a central union for social reform, consisting\r\nof members of the middle classes interested in the emancipation of\r\nlabour, and a Christian social working men’s party. The former has had\r\nconsiderable success, especially among the Lutheran clergy. The movement\r\nmet with the most strenuous resistance from the Social Democratic party,\r\nand was greatly hampered by the anti-socialist law of 1878.\r\n\r\nIn recent years all the sections of the Christian Church in England have\r\nfelt the influence of the democratic movement, and have shown a\r\ncommendable interest in social questions. Among Catholics the most\r\nnotable representative of this new spirit was Cardinal Manning. The\r\nReport on Socialism made to the Pan-Anglican Conference, which met at\r\nLambeth in 1888, by the committee appointed to deal with the question,\r\nwas also a remarkable sign of the times. This Report accepted what\r\nshould be regarded as the main aim of socialism—the reunion of capital\r\nand labour through the principle of association. Without expressing an\r\nopinion on the Report, the Conference commended it to the consideration\r\nof the people. The Christian Social Union, founded in 1889 by members of\r\nthe Church of England, has done good service. Its aim is to study ‘how\r\nto apply the moral truths and principles of Christianity to the social\r\nand economic difficulties of the present time.’ The late Dr. Westcott,\r\nBishop of Durham, took a leading part in founding and guiding it. It is\r\nopen to Conservatives and Liberals, socialists and non-socialists, who\r\naccept its main aim, as above stated. In a pamphlet on _Socialism_ Dr.\r\nWestcott gives one of the best and finest expositions of the principles\r\nof the subject which we have read.\r\n\r\nThe sympathetic attitude towards labour shown at the Lambeth Conference\r\nof 1888 was maintained also at the Conferences of 1897 and 1908. Very\r\nnoteworthy was the favourable reception given to socialistic expressions\r\nof opinion at the Pan-Anglican Congress which preceded the Conference of\r\n1908, though it would obviously be a mistake to assume that it meant the\r\nacceptance of any definite collectivist economic creed. A like\r\nsympathetic feeling has been shown in many nonconformist quarters. Dr.\r\nClifford, so eminent as a nonconformist leader, is a socialist and\r\nmember of the Fabian Society.\r\n\r\n4. It is needless to speak of the great revolution in current opinion\r\nregarding labour, as reflected in the press and in contemporary\r\nliterature. All is changed since the time when Carlyle and Ruskin lifted\r\nup their voices in the wilderness to an unbelieving generation! All that\r\nis best, all that is tenable in the teaching of those two great men is\r\ncomprehended in socialism rightly understood.\r\n\r\n5. Nor is it necessary to say anything of the greatest change of all,\r\nwhich has taken place in the opinions and feelings of the masses of\r\nworking men, who constitute the modern democracy. Few men, however,\r\nreally understand the new power that has arisen in the growing\r\nintelligence of the workers, in the discontent, in the passion for\r\nimprovement, in the hopes and aspirations which so deeply move them. It\r\nhas not yet found adequate expression, direction, and organisation; but\r\nevery year it is making fresh advance towards clearness of aim. A main\r\npart of the significance of Marx’s activity lay in the fact that he\r\nstrove to give utterance and organisation to this vast and growing mass\r\nof vague and half-conscious sentiment. In the future we can but hope\r\nthat it will receive wise and salutary guidance.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[1] _Protokoll_ of the party meeting at Jena, p. 298.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n                      TENDENCIES TOWARDS SOCIALISM\r\n\r\nSo much may fairly be said regarding the influence of socialistic\r\nspeculation on the opinion of the civilised world. It must be admitted,\r\nhowever, that as yet the change is mainly in the region of opinion. For\r\nin the domain of practice the competitive system, in spite of many very\r\nimportant modifications, still holds the field; and the old Political\r\nEconomy, though greatly discredited, still finds its strongest\r\njustification in the fact that it is a reasonably accurate analysis of\r\nan existing and working system. When asked for any grounds that may be\r\nbrought forward for believing that the socialistic ideal is becoming a\r\nreality, we can only point to symptoms or tendencies, not to definite\r\nresults on a scale commensurate with the development of modern industry.\r\n\r\nYet these tendencies are large, most significant, and visibly\r\nincreasing. The following are the main lines along which they may be\r\nobserved:—\r\n\r\n1. The State, which by a reasonable socialism should be regarded as the\r\nassociation of men on a large scale, and as such should continue to have\r\na most important function.\r\n\r\n2. The Municipality, or Commune, which, notwithstanding certain\r\nobjections, is the more convenient word, as it includes the parish as\r\nwell as the municipality, and which should be regarded as the\r\nassociation for local purposes. As every one knows how greatly the range\r\nof State and municipal action for the common good has been extended in\r\nrecent years, we need not enlarge on this aspect of our subject. But in\r\nwhat we have to say it will be convenient to consider the State and the\r\nlocal body together, as they are really complements of each other. In a\r\nwell-ordered community there should be no real opposition between the\r\ntwo. Under the conditions which now prevail there can be no nourishing\r\nlocal life except in reasonable relation to an efficient central organ;\r\nand the central organ can do its part wisely and effectively only by\r\nallowing suitable scope to local energy. No absolute rules can be laid\r\ndown for the relations of the two to each other; these must be\r\ndetermined by considerations of time and circumstance. But the problem\r\nof their opposition under any _régime_ can be a difficulty only for\r\nunwise statesmanship.\r\n\r\nIt may not be a new thing in theory, that the State should be an\r\nassociation for the promotion of the common interests of all its\r\nmembers, or that the commune should be an association for the general\r\ngood of the inhabitants of a locality; but it is practically new. It is\r\nonly during the last generation that the people who form the majority of\r\nevery society have received any reasonable consideration from the organs\r\nof the State. We have during the last seventy years seen a tardy\r\nreversal of the old injustice in our own country, and for some years the\r\nmovement towards improvement has been growing apace. But our leading\r\nstatesmen seem even yet to be reluctant or only half willing to advance.\r\nThe domestic history of recent times is the record of concessions made,\r\nnot because the leaders of either of our great parties particularly\r\napproved of them, but because they were demanded by large sections of\r\nvoters. In fact the initiative in legislation has now passed from the\r\nstatesmen to the democracy. We can hardly regard it as the outcome of a\r\nreasoned and comprehensive theory of the State when politicians trained\r\nin the theory and practice of _laissez-faire_ in 1908 passed an Old Age\r\nPensions Bill, which under certain restrictions gave a pension of 5s. a\r\nweek to persons over 70.\r\n\r\nThe statesmen of Germany have been more consistent; for when they\r\ninaugurated their schemes of State socialism they frankly proclaimed\r\ntheir adhesion to its principles. In this they were encouraged by the\r\nold law of Prussia, which recognised the duty of the State to provide\r\nsubsistence for those who could not make a living, and labour for those\r\nwho were out of employment. The position of the Prussian kingdom has\r\nalways been such that it required to foster the full strength of the\r\nState by all available means, and therefore could not afford to neglect\r\nany considerable portion of its population. In his State socialism,\r\ntherefore, Bismarck could appeal with some show of reason to the\r\ntraditional policy of Prussia. But it was really a new departure.\r\n\r\nIts leading principles were announced in an Imperial message to the\r\nReichstag on the 17th of November 1881. Besides the repressive measures\r\nnecessary to restrain the excesses of the Social Democracy, the Emperor\r\ndeclared that the healing of social evils was to be sought in positive\r\nmeasures for the good of the working man. The measures proposed were for\r\nthe insurance of the workmen against accident, sickness, old age, and\r\ninability to work, by arrangements under State control. ‘The finding of\r\nthe right ways and means for this State protection of the working man is\r\na difficult task, but also one of the highest duties that concern every\r\nsociety standing on the ethical foundations of the Christian national\r\nlife.’ The aged Emperor next went on to say that he would look back with\r\ngreater satisfaction on the successes with which Providence had visibly\r\nblessed his reign, if he could bequeath to the Fatherland new and\r\nlasting pledges of peace at home, and to the needy greater security and\r\nlarger means for rendering the help to which they had a claim. The\r\nmessage also spoke of ‘organising the life of the people in the form of\r\ncorporative associations under the protection and furtherance of the\r\nState, to render possible the solution of problems which the central\r\npower alone cannot undertake.’ The Imperial programme has now been\r\nrealised. It may be regarded as the beginning of better things to come.\r\nThe help provided by its various measures is scanty enough, but no one\r\ncan reasonably doubt that it is immeasurably superior to our English\r\nPoor Law.\r\n\r\nSo much for State socialism in Germany. To find a democracy which is\r\nreally government of the people by the people for the people, we must go\r\nto our colonies at the antipodes. It is a democracy which both in theory\r\nand practice has most fully recognised that the State is an association\r\nfor the promotion of the well-being of the whole people. New Zealand,\r\none of the youngest of the English colonies, is the finest example of\r\nsuch a State. The State in New Zealand owns and works railways,\r\ntelegraphs, and telephones. When the Bank of New Zealand was on the\r\npoint of stopping payment, with the most disastrous results to the\r\ncountry, the government came to its help with a guarantee of £4,000,000\r\nand made it a State institution. It made advances of cheap money to\r\nsettlers and passed legislation to break up large estates. The laws for\r\nthe protection of labour are of the most advanced type. It settles\r\nlabour disputes by compulsory arbitration, and has in operation an\r\nold-age pension scheme by which persons over 65 years of age receive an\r\nannual pension. At first fixed at £18, this has been raised to £26, or\r\n10s. a week. It has introduced women’s suffrage, graduated taxation, a\r\ncomplete system of local option in the drink trade, a public system of\r\nlife insurance and of medical care, and a public trustee with very wide\r\nand beneficent powers.\r\n\r\nAll these measures and others which we need not name are the outcome in\r\nNew Zealand of a great wave of agrarian labour and socialistic feeling\r\nwhich spread over the world about twenty years ago. It has been well\r\ndescribed as socialism without dogma. Every measure has been examined\r\nand approved on its merits. The policy therefore is all the more\r\nvaluable as a mass of testimony to the beneficent tendency of a\r\nreasonable socialism. The conditions have no doubt been exceptionally\r\nfavourable. New Zealand is a young country with great natural advantages\r\nand a small population which has a very high average of intelligence,\r\ninitiative, and energy. It is an example, however, which should be most\r\nencouraging to the world, as it shows what may be done in a true\r\ndemocracy, where the government is in entire sympathy with the people\r\nand responsive to their wishes. The high honour of carrying out this\r\nmodel legislation belongs to Richard Seddon and his associates. Seddon\r\nwas Prime Minister of New Zealand from 1893 to his death in 1906.\r\n\r\n3. The co-operative society or association for the ordinary purposes of\r\nindustry.—Co-operation for some time made comparatively little progress\r\nin production, but when we consider the low point from which the\r\nmovement started, only about sixty years ago, and how painfully capital,\r\nexperience, and skill had to be acquired by the poor workers, we should\r\nrather be surprised at the advance that has been made in so many\r\nprogressive countries. It is only a partial realisation of the\r\nsocialistic ideal, but it is well founded, solid, and most promising.\r\nIts strongest point is that it has arisen directly out of the people and\r\nremains in close touch with them.\r\n\r\nIn England a co-operative society is usually a group of workers who\r\nmanage distribution with their joint capital in their own interests. The\r\ngroup is entirely democratic, open to every one, organised on the\r\nprinciple of one man one vote, and choosing their own committee or\r\nexecutive; the manager is a social functionary; no member can legally\r\nhold more than £200 of capital in any society. Production, especially\r\nfor domestic consumption, has now made very great progress. In 1907 the\r\nmovement had 1566 registered societies and 2,434,000 members. By that\r\ndate the £28 with which the movement started in 1844 had expanded into a\r\ncapital of £32,000,000, with an annual turnover of £105,000,000, and an\r\nannual profit of £12,000,000. It provides for the consumption of\r\none-fifth of the population. The co-operative movement in Great Britain\r\nis already an industrial and economic power of no mean order. If it has\r\nnot solved the social question, it has at least done much to clear the\r\nway towards a solution. The movement is also making rapid progress in\r\nGermany, Austria, Belgium, France, and Italy, and its greatest successes\r\nare in other fields than distribution. In Denmark the co-operative\r\nsystem is one of the brightest features of recent history. More recently\r\na co-operative movement of great promise has begun in Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe co-operative society, therefore, is a self-governing group of\r\nworkers, which has already made very considerable progress in\r\ncontrolling the economic interests of the labouring class. Not a little\r\ndisappointment is felt that it has not accomplished greater results; as\r\nwe believe, without good ground. It might reasonably have been expected\r\nthat human nature would survive among co-operators, and that the\r\nself-regarding principle would continue to be the mainspring of\r\nindividual action. Better social arrangements can only provide for it a\r\nmore efficient system of regulation.\r\n\r\nIt is particularly regrettable that co-operative societies have not\r\nalways had sufficient regard for their employees. There can be little\r\ndoubt that the contrast between producers and consumers, and between the\r\ncentralising and de-centralising tendencies in organisation, will long\r\nbe a difficulty among co-operators, who do not thoroughly understand the\r\nnew system to which they belong. Yet it should also be said that many of\r\nthe objections raised by the critics of the movement are really due to\r\nthe fact that they do not understand its real nature, and imagine that\r\nthey find old things where really they meet only old names.\r\n\r\nThe noblest embodiment of the co-operative idea is to be found in one of\r\nthe oldest seats of industry in Western Europe. This is the Vooruit\r\n(Forward) Society, which was founded at Ghent in a season of scarcity by\r\nEdouard Anseele and a few weavers in 1873. It was started with a capital\r\nof 84 francs and 93 centimes, about £3: 8s., at first naturally as a\r\nbakery, and has grown till it embraces the economy and life of about\r\n100,000 out of the 165,000 inhabitants of the city. Besides the enormous\r\nand splendidly-equipped bakeries, it has huge stores and the largest\r\ncotton factory in Ghent, with an eight-hours’ day. It has its own\r\nprinting works, a daily and weekly press, its own system of life\r\ninsurance, and old-age pensions. It offers to its members at its\r\nPeople’s Palace the means of education and of wholesome recreation and\r\nit encourages art. This is a great achievement in a country where Church\r\nand State, landlord and capitalist, have so long combined to keep the\r\nworkers in the lowest ignorance and degradation. The Vooruit has been a\r\nmodel to similar co-operative enterprises not only in Belgium, but in\r\nFrance, Holland, and Germany.\r\n\r\n4. Of all the recent movements for the better ordering of society in\r\nEngland, we believe the co-operative movement to be the most hopeful,\r\nbecause the most thorough and practical, but it is only one of many.\r\nDuring the last half-century we have seen a long succession of efforts,\r\npartially successful, towards a new organisation of society rendered\r\nnecessary by the changes due to the industrial revolution. In all\r\nspheres the watchword of the new era has been freedom, the removal of\r\nrestraint. But it has been found that positive measures of\r\nreconstruction were also necessary. Factory legislation carried in\r\nopposition to the prevailing economic theory, trade-unions, employers’\r\ncombinations, industrial partnerships, boards of conciliation, the\r\nco-operative system,—all these are real, if partial, endeavours towards\r\na new organisation of society suited to the new conditions. They are all\r\nmodifications and limitations imposed on the competitive system, and to\r\nthem the progress of the last sixty years is largely due. Socialism\r\nclaims to be the comprehensive scheme of organisation which embraces in\r\na complete and consistent unity all these partial efforts.\r\n\r\n5. But the most striking feature of recent economic history is the\r\ncontinuation of the movement which began with the industrial revolution.\r\nThrough this process the small producer was superseded by the\r\ncapitalist, the smaller capitalist by the larger. And now the single\r\ncapitalist is being absorbed by the company, an increasing proportion of\r\nthe world’s business being so vast that only a great company can provide\r\nthe requisite capital and organisation; whilst in the large companies,\r\nin case they cannot drive each other out of the field, there is a marked\r\ntendency to bring about a fusion of interests. In all this we see a\r\ngreat constructive process going on as the result of the inherent laws\r\nof industrial development.\r\n\r\nThe movement is active in our own country; but it is far surpassed in\r\nmagnitude and activity by similar phenomena in the United States of\r\nAmerica, where it is favoured by special circumstances. Under the\r\nprotective system the economic development of America has proceeded\r\nwithout being disturbed by the industrial power of England. It is a\r\nself-contained and self-sufficing continent with a vast area and\r\nenormous natural resources. The people have not such a wide variety of\r\npolitical, social, literary, and artistic interests as have the ruling\r\nclasses of England, and have therefore been all the more keenly engaged\r\nin the exploitation of the new world that lay open to them. Capitalism\r\nin America has shown an energy, acuteness, and fertility of resource\r\nwhich even in England are unparalleled. But in the various departments\r\nof industry the chiefs have found that competition may be suicidal and\r\nmutually destructive, and have therefore seen it expedient to arrange\r\nwith each other for the regulation of production, of prices and wages.\r\nHence the trusts, or great combinations of capitalists, which now\r\nconfront American society and the American Republic, and which, as the\r\nlatest development of capitalism, are well calculated to excite\r\nscientific curiosity in every country.\r\n\r\nThe trust system is, however, by no means confined to America. A like\r\norganisation under the name of cartels or syndicates is, in proportion\r\nto the size of the country, almost equally strong in Germany. In forms\r\nmore or less open and undisguised it is spreading in England, Austria,\r\nand other lands. It may be regarded as an inevitable stage in the\r\nnatural history of capitalism.\r\n\r\nThus far have we come through the natural growth of the company. If we\r\nconsider the nature and development of the company, we shall find that\r\nit is not entirely undemocratic. The directors are, in principle at\r\nleast, elected and removable by the shareholders. And as the shares are\r\nopen for purchase by any one, a porter may be a shareholder in the\r\nrailway company of which he is a servant, with, so far, a voice in the\r\nmanagement. But in point of fact the companies are owned and controlled\r\nby the capitalist classes, and are a development of capitalism. The\r\ndirectors are usually large capitalists. Their main aim is to produce\r\ndividends. The relation of the management to the employees cannot have\r\nmuch of a kindly, human, and personal element.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the development of the company in a large degree\r\nmeans that the real administration of the economic movement is passing\r\nout of the hands of the owner of capital as such. The companies are for\r\nthe most part managed by paid officials, who may or may not have a\r\nsubstantial holding in the capital. That is, the capitalists do not\r\nreally manage the companies in which their capital is embarked. The\r\nmanager, with a staff of paid officials, has become the pivot of the\r\nindustrial movement. Generally speaking, the large company is more\r\namenable to social regulation than a variety of small enterprises. And\r\nnow we see that the natural development of the company has prepared the\r\nwhole organisation necessary for its complete transference to social\r\nownership and control, if such a step were deemed advisable. A great\r\nrailway or system of water-supply can be transferred to State or\r\nmunicipal control without any particular change in the organisation by\r\nwhich it is worked. In fact, capitalism has prepared or is preparing the\r\nmechanism by which it may be superseded. It has done its work so\r\nthoroughly that it has been rendering even itself superfluous. We need\r\nnot add that preparatory steps towards the transformation of the company\r\nmay also be seen in the spread of the principle of industrial\r\npartnerships or profit-sharing. In America, where the industrial\r\ndevelopment is more recent, the founders of the great corporations still\r\nto a large degree continue to control them. Yet we can see how the\r\nconstructive talent they have so marvellously shown has paved the way\r\nfor social control when the time may come for it.\r\n\r\n6. But the greatest force in the social evolution of the present time\r\nconsists of the human beings who are most directly interested in it—the\r\nmodern democracy. This democracy is marked by a combination of\r\ncharacteristics which are new to history. It is being educated and\r\nenlightened in the school and by the cheap press; it is being drilled\r\nand organised in large factories, in the national armies, by vast\r\npopular demonstrations, in the gigantic electoral struggles of the time.\r\nThus it is becoming conscious of its enormous power, and able to make\r\nuse of it. It is becoming conscious also of its unsatisfactory social\r\nand economic position. The democracy which is growing to be the\r\nmaster-force of the civilised world is still for the most part\r\neconomically a proletariat dependent on precarious wage-labour. While\r\nthey are resolved to proceed with the consummation of the political\r\nchange which is involved in the establishment of democracy, their goal\r\nis an economic transformation. But the inevitable process of\r\nconcentration of industrial operations already referred to is entirely\r\nagainst the continuance or restoration of the small producer, whether\r\nworkman or peasant proprietor. Such efforts of continuance or\r\nrestoration are reactionary: they are economically unsound and must\r\nfail. The economic transformation must be sought in the application of\r\nthe principle of association to the large industry.\r\n\r\n7. We are thus brought to the conclusion that the competitive system,\r\nwith precarious wage-labour as the lot of the vast majority of the\r\npeople, is not a suitable and adequate form for the social development\r\nof the future. The competitive system has led to great strikes, which\r\nhave been the cause of widespread misery, almost as grievous as the\r\nsuffering endured during the worst campaigns under the old style of\r\nwarfare. It has led to great commercial and industrial crises, which\r\nhave scattered over the civilised world panic and ruin, followed by\r\nlong-continued stagnation and depression. Thus anarchy, waste, and\r\nstarvation have been its too frequent attendants, while the normal\r\nposition of the workmen under it has been precarious and unworthy of\r\nfree, enlightened men. England has had less reason than most countries\r\nto regret the prevalence of competition, for her industrial supremacy\r\nhas generally left her victor in the struggle, and she has hitherto\r\nlooked forward to widening markets as the solution of her economic\r\ntroubles. But the rapid development of Germany and America may teach us\r\nthat our industrial position is not so secure against assault as it used\r\nto be, and that we may in future suffer the bitter experience of the\r\nvanquished, which we have so long inflicted on others. And we may thus\r\nlearn that reason and law should control industry and commerce as well\r\nas other spheres of human activity.\r\n\r\nIn America the development of the trust system is only another proof of\r\nthe inadequacy of the competitive system. The supporters of the trusts\r\nmaintain with very good show of reason that unregulated competition is\r\nharmful and may be ruinous to all concerned, and that they can maintain\r\nfair prices, pay fair wages, and secure a fair return to capital only by\r\nmutual arrangement among the producers. But the system obviously\r\ninvolves the serious objection, that the great industrial chiefs who\r\norganise and direct the trusts are thereby constituted supreme judges of\r\ntheir own interests and of the economic interests of the whole American\r\npeople; that such combinations form a huge monopoly in so many of the\r\nleading articles of consumption, and establish an economic, social, and\r\npolitical power which may be a danger to American society. In short, we\r\nare driven to the result that while competition has been hurtful or\r\nruinous to those engaged in it, the now prevailing system of regulation\r\nby capitalism in its own interests is a serious danger to the whole\r\npeople. There is only one right way out of such a dilemma. A return to\r\nthe competitive method is neither possible nor desirable. Monopoly is\r\nincompatible with freedom. The only course for peoples who desire to be\r\nfree is to adopt some form of social ownership and control. This appears\r\nto be the lesson taught us by the development of the trusts.\r\n\r\n8. The success of socialism greatly depends on the realisation of the\r\ntwo ideals, which may be regarded as the main pillars of the theory,\r\nwhen applied to practice. These are:—\r\n\r\n(_a_) The normal working day: the general reduction of the working day\r\nto eight hours in the immediate future, and eventually to a shorter\r\ntime. Such a desirable change would be better accomplished by voluntary\r\nagreement under the pressure of public opinion than by legislation; but\r\nit would be better made by legislation than by the cruel and clumsy\r\nmethod of strikes.\r\n\r\n(_b_) A remuneration which will ensure a suitable standard of living; in\r\nother words, the means of a normal development. A reasonable standard of\r\nliving, the competent means of a normal development have been determined\r\nby science and are no longer a matter of utopian guess-work. A fairly\r\ndefinite measure of fresh air, food, clothing, house comfort,\r\nrecreation, and of satisfaction for the affections associated with wife\r\nand children constitute the rational needs of the average man. This is\r\nthe moral and scientific basis of a rational system of distribution. The\r\ncompetitive wage determined by the _iron law of wages_ of the older\r\neconomists should be superseded by a remuneration embodying this\r\nprinciple. It is the Daily Bread of the Lord’s Prayer as definable by\r\nmodern science.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the socialistic theory on these points is to remove two\r\nvital interests of man from the range of competition, and to place them\r\non an ethical and scientific basis under social control. In so far as\r\nthe working day of the employees of government, municipalities,\r\nco-operative societies, companies, and private firms approximates to\r\neight hours, in so far as the wage paid by them secures to the workers a\r\nfit and reasonable standard of living, in so far is the socialistic\r\nideal realised. Every one conversant with the history of the last sixty\r\nyears knows how vast an improvement has been made in both respects.\r\n\r\nWe have thus reviewed the great social and economic movements of our\r\ntime. How shall we interpret them? There are two main tendencies: one\r\ntowards control of the economic processes by the people in state,\r\nmunicipality, and co-operative society; the other towards the\r\nconsolidation of capitalism in trusts. In both we see plan, constructive\r\nand organising intelligence, the limitation of the anarchy of\r\ncompetition. But while the former makes for the public good, the latter\r\nis subservient to overgrown wealth.\r\n\r\nThe portentous growth of the trusts is indeed an object-lesson to the\r\nworld. It proves that socialism is not an idle question; nor is it\r\nutopian or revolutionary merely. It is a question forced upon the\r\npresent generation by the most gigantic industrial movement of recent\r\ntimes. All good citizens, all friends of righteousness and of progress,\r\nall inquirers worthy of the name, are under an imperative obligation to\r\nunderstand the true inwardness of the subject.\r\n\r\nIn considering the question of the practicability of a rational\r\nsocialism, let us remember that it only proposes to accomplish on a\r\nwider scale and for a more enlightened time a task analogous to that\r\nundertaken by the guilds for the mediæval world. The guild was an\r\norganisation for the promotion of the common interests of the workers at\r\na time when law and order were not sufficiently established by strong\r\ncentral governments, and when the present distinction between labourer\r\nand capitalist had not declared itself. It was a fairly equitable\r\norganisation of an industry which was local and associated with city\r\nlife, and which worked with a very limited and undeveloped technique.\r\nSocialism proposes an equitable organisation of industry for the modern\r\nworld with its enormous mechanical development and large industry, under\r\na democracy guided by science and professing allegiance to the highest\r\nmoral ideals.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n                        THE PREVALENT SOCIALISM\r\n\r\nIn the Erfurt Programme we have seen that the task of the social\r\ndemocracy is to give form and unity to the struggle of the working\r\nclass, and to point out its natural and necessary goal. This goal is the\r\ntransformation of private property in the means of production into\r\ncollective property, but the change will be accomplished not in the\r\ninterest of a class but of the entire human race. The Erfurt Programme\r\nhas been followed by others of a like nature in Belgium, Austria,\r\nFrance, and elsewhere. It may be regarded as the aim of the social\r\ndemocracy of all countries to obtain possession of political power in\r\norder to make the economic transformation which we have indicated.\r\n\r\nA like aim has been set forth in the resolutions passed at International\r\nCongresses. In a previous chapter we have seen that International\r\nCongresses were held at Paris in 1889, at Brussels in 1891, at Zürich in\r\n1893, and at London in 1896. These were followed by Congresses, at Paris\r\nfor a second time in 1900, at Amsterdam in 1904, and at Stuttgart in\r\n1907.\r\n\r\nThe disorders which prevailed at the Congresses of Brussels and London\r\nled to the adoption of measures for the better ordering of business and\r\nfor the better organisation of the Congresses, ‘destined to become the\r\nparliament of the proletariat.’ We shall now give a brief statement of\r\nthe new measures, which date in a general way from the Paris Congress of\r\n1900.\r\n\r\nAs to terms of admission. All associations are admitted which adhere to\r\nthe essential principles of socialism: socialisation of the means of\r\nproduction and exchange; international union and action of the workers;\r\nsocialist conquest of political power by the proletariat organised as a\r\nclass party. Also all the trade organisations which place themselves on\r\nthe basis of the class struggle and recognise the necessity of political\r\naction, legislative and parliamentary. Anarchists are therefore\r\nexcluded.\r\n\r\nAn International Socialist Bureau having its seat at Brussels has been\r\nestablished. It consists of two delegates from each country and has a\r\npermanent secretary. Among other functions the Bureau and its secretary\r\nhave to organise the International Congresses and to arrange the order\r\nof business at them.\r\n\r\nAt former Congresses much time was spent in hearing verbal reports, in\r\nFrench, English, and German, of the progress of socialism in the various\r\ncountries. The Bureau now invites and receives from the various national\r\nbodies reports, which are printed and laid before the Congress. These\r\nreports form a most valuable storehouse of information with regard to\r\nthe development of socialism throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThe result of those measures was manifest at the Stuttgart Congress,\r\nwhere the business proceeded with dispatch and in comparative order.\r\nDelegates to the number of 886 were assembled from twenty-six\r\nnationalities, and discussed matters of importance relating to the\r\ninternational social movement. The revival of the International could be\r\nregarded as an accomplished fact. But it was a revival in a new form and\r\nunder conditions which had undergone a marvellous change. The old\r\nInternational has been compared by Vandervelde to a brilliant general\r\nstaff without an army. In many countries the socialist cause had hardly\r\nbegun to move; in no country had it attained to any real strength. Now\r\nsocialism had powerful and well-organised parties in most of the leading\r\ncountries of Europe, and it counted its adherents by millions.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau at Brussels does not perform the functions of the general\r\ncouncil of the old International. It has no commanding mind and will,\r\nlike that of Karl Marx, to supply initiative and energy. It serves as a\r\nconnecting link between the national parties; it tends to co-ordinate\r\ntheories, tactics, and action. But the vitality and moving force of the\r\nnew International are found in the different national groups.\r\n\r\nWe may say, then, that the new International only in a limited measure\r\nrealises the thought of Marx. The idea of using political power as an\r\ninstrument of social amelioration originated with the Chartists and L.\r\nBlanc. Marx in the communist manifesto first made it international and\r\nrevolutionary, and he claimed also to have made it scientific. It was\r\nscientific in so far as it was a reasoned and comprehensive expression\r\nof real forces. In the International as we now have it we may perceive\r\nan organisation of the real forces which Marx had the insight to foresee\r\nand enjoin.\r\n\r\nA long series of resolutions have been passed by the various Congresses\r\nwhich have met since 1889. If we take those resolutions along with the\r\nelaborate programmes that have been formulated by the various national\r\nparties, and of which the Erfurt programme may be regarded as the type,\r\nwe have a set of documents which may undoubtedly be considered official\r\nand authoritative. Both resolutions and programmes are the result of a\r\nlong labour of thought and debate by their best minds. They agree\r\ngenerally in their exposition of principles and tactics. We may,\r\ntherefore, have no doubt that they contain a reliable statement of the\r\nprevalent socialism. We give an abstract of the most important points on\r\nwhich socialists of all lands agree:—\r\n\r\n(1) The goal of the whole movement is an economic revolution or\r\ntransformation—the transference to society of the means of production,\r\ndistribution, and exchange.\r\n\r\n(2) The conquest of political power by the organised action of the\r\nworking class of all lands is the chief means towards this great end.\r\n\r\n(3) The great task of the socialist parties at present is education,\r\nagitation, and organisation in the widest sense, with a view to the\r\nphysical and moral regeneration of the working class, so as to fit it\r\nfor its great mission. To rouse the class consciousness of the workers,\r\nto increase their capacity and efficiency for the class struggle, is the\r\ndaily task of international socialism.\r\n\r\n(4) The struggle for equal and direct universal suffrage, for the\r\npopular initiative and referendum, is an important phase of the\r\npolitical struggle, and is fitted to have a good influence on the\r\npolitical education of the workers.\r\n\r\n(5) The more purely political struggle of the Socialist Parties should\r\ngo hand in hand with the more purely economic struggle of the trade\r\nunions.\r\n\r\n(6) The right of association, of combination, of free meeting, of free\r\nspeech, and of a free press, is an essential part of the worker’s claim\r\nof rights.\r\n\r\n(7) The demonstration of the 1st of May is specially recommended in all\r\ncountries as a means of securing an eight-hours’ working day. The\r\neight-hours’ day is most desirable for improving the family life, the\r\neducation, the health, energy, intelligence, and morality of the working\r\nclass.\r\n\r\n(8) But the eight-hours’ day is only the most urgent part of a large\r\nsystem of protective legislation in favour of the working class. Besides\r\nan eight-hours’ day for adults, they demand special legislation for\r\nchildren, young people, and women; proper rest for all ages; restriction\r\nof night work; abolition of the sweating system; effective inspection of\r\nfactories, shops, and of domestic labour, as well as of agriculture.\r\n\r\n(9) They are very strongly opposed to militarism, which they consider\r\ndue not so much to national or political differences, as to the struggle\r\nof the capitalist classes for new markets. They believe that war will\r\nend only with the ending of capitalism. The present standing armies are\r\nthe instruments of the ruling and exploiting class, and should be\r\nabolished. Their place should be taken by a citizen army or the armed\r\nnation; that is, the entire able-bodied manhood of the people should be\r\ntrained and equipped on a democratic basis, like the Swiss army. The\r\nSocialist Parties of the various countries are recommended to vote\r\nagainst expenditure for existing army and navy.\r\n\r\n(10) The majority at Congresses has without reserve condemned the\r\ncolonial system as being merely an extension of the field of\r\nexploitation of the capitalist class. But this majority has consisted\r\nmainly of nations that have little knowledge of colonies and little\r\ninterest in them. It has ignored the colonial system of England, which\r\nhas so largely consisted in the development of self-governing\r\ncommunities; and it has also ignored or misunderstood the beneficent\r\nwork of England in establishing conditions of peace, order, and progress\r\nin India. The colonial system as understood by the majority simply means\r\nthe exploitation of native and coloured races for the profit of the\r\ncapitalist class. A large minority, while condemning the present\r\ncolonial policy, think that it might be made beneficial.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the whole movement is collectivism; but little or nothing is\r\nsaid as to the forms it will take or how it will be realised. That task\r\nis left to the future. On the other hand, much is said of the means by\r\nwhich political power may be gained. Among these we should observe that\r\nthe two points which are most essential, and may be regarded as the key\r\nof the whole position, are universal suffrage and the right of\r\ncombination, the former being necessary for the purely political\r\ndevelopment of socialism, the latter for the development of labour in\r\ntrade unions. For these two rights socialism and labour are prepared to\r\nput forth the greatest efforts and to make the greatest sacrifices. For\r\nthem the orderly and well-disciplined Social Democracy of Germany is\r\nready to adopt in the last resort the drastic measure of the general\r\nstrike.[1] Demonstrations in favour of universal suffrage have been\r\nfrequent events during recent years in many European countries. The\r\nRussian Socialist Revolutionary Party has declared itself ready to\r\naccept as a field of agitation a constituent assembly elected on a\r\nthoroughly democratic basis and embodying the sovereign will of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe rights of the trade union have quite recently been a supreme\r\ninterest to the Labour Party in Great Britain. And in America the use of\r\nthe ‘injunctions’ to hinder the development of labour combinations has\r\nbeen a chief grievance among the workmen. This grievance took a foremost\r\nplace in the discussion of matters which went to form the platforms of\r\ncandidates at the Presidential election of 1908. Universal suffrage and\r\nthe right of combination, with all that these two great rights involve,\r\nmay be regarded as the central points in the present tactics and policy\r\nof international socialism.\r\n\r\nThe other points in the above statement may here be left to speak for\r\nthemselves. But if we note that the most deeply resented grievance of\r\nthe workmen is the use of the police and the military by the executives\r\nof various countries to repress agitation, we shall the better\r\nunderstand many incidents of recent history in Italy, Russia, and even\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the task which lies before the social democracy is\r\na vast one. As yet even the political part of it is only to a small\r\nextent realised. At present the working class, though forming the vast\r\nmajority of the people, has no corresponding representation in\r\nlegislatures or influence in government. In England the ruling class has\r\nlong been, and still is, an aristocracy, slowly changing in the course\r\nof generations into a plutocracy which has the wisdom to yield to the\r\never-growing pressure of democracy. France is now nearer to a real\r\ndemocracy than any other great European state. In Germany the executive\r\ndepends on the Emperor; but his Chancellor has to find a majority for\r\nlegislation and for the budgets in the Reichstag, which is elected by\r\nuniversal suffrage with an antiquated distribution of seats. The German\r\nexecutive is really a bureaucracy with the Emperor as chief. Government\r\nin Austria and Russia is also a bureaucracy of which the Emperor is the\r\nhead. In Italy the democracy is slowly growing. It has very little real\r\ninfluence in Spain.\r\n\r\nIf the American people do not exert themselves very effectively in the\r\nimmediate future, the Republic seems destined to be a plutocracy. A\r\npower which appears to be incompatible with a real commonwealth has\r\narisen in a marvellously short time. The oil industry in America goes\r\nback only to 1859. Mr. J. D. Rockefeller entered the trade in 1865. It\r\nwas organised by him and his associates into the Standard Oil Company;\r\nand the Company has been the type of further organisation, has provided\r\nthe men, the methods, and the capital, by which other great industries\r\nhave been transformed. That is to say, Mr. J. D. Rockefeller and the men\r\ntrained in his methods have gained control of railways, of finance and\r\ninsurance, and even of the basic industries of steel and coal. The\r\nprocess has naturally gained enormously in momentum as it has gone on;\r\nthe capital accumulated, and still more the capital controlled by the\r\nTrusts, the interests they have absorbed or brought within their orbit\r\nare gigantic, and continually increasing. Even the American Senate is\r\ndeclared to be in their pay. Most evil of all symptoms, when an eminent\r\nAmerican senator, Mr. Tillman, lately undertook to speak for his order,\r\na main point in his defence was, that the House of Representatives was\r\nworse than the Senate! Thus we see the industrial and economic power,\r\nwhich is also the money power, subordinating to itself the political,\r\nand, indeed, threatening all that is articulate and organic in the\r\nAmerican people. In 1908, at the Chicago Convention, Senator Lodge went\r\nto the heart of the matter: ‘It is the huge size of private fortunes and\r\nthe vast extent of the power of modern combinations of capital which\r\nhave brought upon us in these later years problems portentous in their\r\npossibilities, and threatening not only our social and political\r\nwelfare, but even our personal freedom if they are not boldly met and\r\nwisely solved.’\r\n\r\nWarnings have been given by some observers, including the present\r\nwriter, that such a condition of things was coming. In my _Inquiry into\r\nSocialism_, published in 1887, I said: ‘In crossing the ocean the\r\ncolonists left behind them the monarchy and aristocracy, and many other\r\nsocial forms hoary with venerable abuse; but they carried with them an\r\ninstitution older and more fundamental than royalty or a hereditary\r\nlegislature—human nature itself.’ The old evils of Europe grew out of\r\nhuman nature. On the other side of the Atlantic men will still be human.\r\n‘Freedom in America seems threatened by the domination of great\r\ncorporations, combining to obtain the control of industrial operations,\r\nof governments, and courts of justice. If unchecked by the healthy\r\npublic opinion, and by the collective will of the American people, such\r\ncorporations may establish an economic, social, and political tyranny\r\nquite as oppressive as anything existing in Europe. It will be a\r\nmiserable thing for the world if triumphant democracy, and a material\r\nprosperity unexampled in the annals of mankind, end in a fiasco such as\r\nthis.’[2]\r\n\r\nThe struggle to curb the corporations and bring them within the limits\r\nprescribed by the public good will not be an easy one. Waves of popular\r\nenthusiasm are apt to be fitful and transient, whilst the pull of\r\norganised wealth is steady, continuous, incessant. The favourite\r\nrhetorical figure of the octopus spreading its gigantic tentacles over\r\nAmerican society gives but a faint impression of the subtle and\r\ninsidious activity of the Trusts. Even in Russia the problem is a simple\r\none compared with that in America; the contest with the Tzardom is\r\nmerely one of force striving against force by all available means.\r\nVastly simpler was the earliest struggle of historic civilisation, when\r\nthe Greeks met the clumsy hosts of Persia. The Americans may consider\r\nthemselves as the foremost champions, at the most critical point, in the\r\nmost momentous struggle now going forward on the planet.\r\n\r\n_Noblesse oblige_ was the maxim of a caste that is vanishing. It is\r\nstill an imperative call on all truly noble men and nations. The\r\nAmerican colonies were founded by the noblest pioneers of freedom, from\r\nthe best and strongest races of Europe. Such a high ancestry lays men\r\nunder a special obligation to acquit themselves well in the warfare\r\nagainst organised wealth. One of the main causes of the present\r\nsituation is that in the eager race for wealth or for a living the\r\nAmericans have had no leisure to be good citizens, in the sense\r\ncontemplated by the founders of the Republic. They have left their own\r\nproper civic work to professional politicians. In the combination of\r\nprofessional politicians ready to be bought and of wealthy capitalists\r\nready to buy lies the supreme danger to American freedom. The danger\r\nwill be averted when the people take care duly to think the matter out,\r\nand to enter upon a course of resolute organised action suitable to the\r\ntime and its needs.\r\n\r\nOne of the first duties of the people will obviously be to simplify the\r\ncumbrous machinery of the Constitution, and to make it a more efficient\r\norgan of their will. In the two great crises of American history,\r\nnothing strikes us so forcibly as the high standard of character and\r\nintelligence which was shown. It may be regarded as a symptom of a\r\nreally strong race, that they were so slow and reluctant to take\r\ndecisive measures in the struggle for Independence and at the time of\r\nthe Civil War. We may now see the same natural hesitation in deciding\r\nhow to handle a problem of surpassing gravity. Such crises are the\r\nseverest and truest tests of national character. All friends of freedom\r\nin every part of the world will fervently hope that the people of\r\nAmerica may display their historic qualities of insight, high principle,\r\nenergy, and resolution in the mighty struggle of Commonwealth against\r\nWealth upon which they are entering.\r\n\r\nAccording to Liebknecht, late leader of the German socialists, ‘the\r\nsocial democracy is the party of the whole people, except 200,000 large\r\nproprietors, squires, middle-class capitalists, and priests.’ We need\r\nnot discuss the exactitude of such figures in relation either to Germany\r\nor any other country. It is a fact which no reasonable man can dispute\r\nthat economic and political power is in most civilised countries\r\nactually wielded by a very small minority. Nor need we stay here to\r\ninquire into the methods by which such power has been gained. Even as\r\nregards England we have not yet an impartial and comprehensive account\r\nof the rise of the present economic and political order since the\r\nliquidation of the mediæval system began about the middle of the\r\nfourteenth century. How labour legislation was carried on by the ruling\r\nclass in its own interests for five centuries after 1349; how Henry\r\nVIII. took his courtiers and privy councillors into partnership for the\r\ndividing of the church lands; how commons were inclosed; how even the\r\npoor-law became an occasion for the subjection and degradation of\r\nlabour; how for generations bribery was a normal instrument of\r\ngovernment; how wealth was gained in the slave-trade, in the East\r\nIndies, in the jobbing of government loans and contracts, and by the\r\nimposition of corn-laws—all these we vaguely know, but they have not\r\nyet been presented in a form which can satisfy the canons of scientific\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nIt is too soon, therefore, to determine how far the business of the\r\nStandard Oil Company has been built up on its merits; how far its\r\nsuccess is due to efficient management and organisation by the shrewdest\r\nand ablest men, and how far due to the illegal and immoral methods of\r\nwhich they are accused. At the Chicago Convention in 1908 Senator Lodge\r\nsaid that the great body of the people had come to believe more and more\r\nthat these vast fortunes, these vast combinations of capital, were\r\nformed and built up by tortuous and dishonest means and with a cynical\r\ndisregard of the very laws which the mass of the people were compelled\r\nto obey. On the other hand the _Reminiscences_ of Mr. Rockefeller reveal\r\na rare combination of insight and energy in founding and consolidating a\r\nnew industry which of itself is sufficient to account for success. In\r\nany case, we in England, looking back on our history, have no right to\r\npoint the finger of reproach at our American kinsmen. There is indeed a\r\ncynical theory that our ruling classes are free from such reproach only\r\nbecause they have been sated with the wealth they have already gained.\r\nWith us the struggle has long been decided; whereas in America the dust\r\nand heat of battle still blind the eyes of men.\r\n\r\nThe motives and merits of the agents by which great historic changes are\r\naccomplished, whether they be Julius Cæsar, Henry VIII., or J. D.\r\nRockefeller, form a most interesting and important subject of study. But\r\nfar more important is the problem we must face regarding the forces and\r\nthe issues which they set in movement. Here we are concerned with live\r\nforces and urgent issues.\r\n\r\nBriefly we may describe the situation with which we have to deal as the\r\nstruggle now proceeding between various forms of autocracy, bureaucracy,\r\nand plutocracy, on the one hand, and a social democracy which claims to\r\nrepresent the mass of the people, on the other. The features of the\r\nformer powers we all know. The social democracy is still in its giant\r\nand untried youth. Not very long ago, as we have seen, the German\r\nworking men had neither voice nor organisation nor insight into their\r\nposition and prospects. France, after the failures of 1848, was hardly\r\nbetter. In most countries labour was dumb, or moaning under its burden\r\nof hardship and sorrow. Now much is changed. The working men have the\r\nforemost orators in the world to speak with their enemies in the gate,\r\nand they have an organisation which the strongest statesmen have been\r\nunable to break up or weaken. In previous chapters we have had frequent\r\noccasion to characterise the democracy of which the workers are the vast\r\nmajority. We shall understand it better if we duly consider a few\r\nspecial points.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th November 1905 the city of Vienna saw a new sight. The gay\r\ncity on the Danube has been the scene of many stirring events. It was\r\ntwice in vain besieged by the Turks, and twice taken by Napoleon. It was\r\nthe seat of two congresses which met to rearrange the map of Europe\r\nafter the downfall of the French conqueror. It witnessed many of the\r\nmost dramatic incidents of the mad year (_des tollen jahres_)—the year\r\nof revolution, 1848.\r\n\r\nTo those who can see beneath the surface of things, the scene of\r\nNovember 1905 was vastly more significant than any of the events we have\r\nmentioned. A procession of working men and women, estimated by the\r\ncorrespondent of the _Morning Post_ at 300,000, and by socialist organs\r\nat 250,000, marched under the red flag through the streets. Work ceased\r\nand traffic was stopped, while the serried ranks passed on. But there\r\nwas no tumult, no call for the interference of the police or the display\r\nof military force. Not a shout was raised or song sung or voice heard\r\nabove a whisper. The silence, order, and discipline shown by this vast\r\nhost, which was about equal to either of the great armies that lately\r\ncontended in Manchuria, were even more striking than its numbers.\r\nMembers of parliament who witnessed the demonstration from the\r\nReichsrath declared that they were more impressed by it than by any\r\npolitical event since Austria became a parliamentary state. Even the\r\nmost stubborn adherent of the old order was bound to feel that a new era\r\nhad come, and that the demand for universal suffrage, which was the\r\nobject of the demonstration, could no longer be refused. That very day\r\nlegislation based on universal suffrage was announced by the government.\r\n\r\nThe great demonstration was, indeed, a fit subject for meditation in\r\nAustria, but not in that country only. The monition contained in such an\r\nevent should be taken to heart by all concerned in all lands. In the\r\nordering and organising intelligence, in the self-restraint and force of\r\ncharacter displayed by the working men of Vienna on that day, we see\r\nqualities which are replete with meaning in their relation to the great\r\nproblems of the present century.\r\n\r\nOr let us consider the matter from another point of view. It is now\r\nabout half a century since the socialist agitation began in Germany.\r\nDuring that time the German workmen have received an education in social\r\npolitics such as no university in the world can furnish. They have been\r\naccustomed to the freest and most thorough discussion of the widest\r\nvariety of topics in books and pamphlets, at public meetings and\r\ndebates, in private talks over their beer and coffee. Great strikes,\r\nelections, and demonstrations have been object-lessons to them of the\r\nmost vivid and forcible description. A new move on the part of the\r\nKaiser, a new speech of Bebel or Liebknecht has given fresh food for\r\nreflection and discourse. Above all, the matters so handled have come\r\nnear to their hearts, have touched them in their everyday life in the\r\nclosest and most real way. They were no hearsay, conventional, or\r\ntraditional subjects that thus appealed to them! Need we wonder that the\r\nteaching of Marx, Lassalle, and Engels has become a possession to them,\r\na theme for mind and heart? The seed has taken root among millions of\r\nmen and women remarkable for intelligence, thoroughness, and\r\nearnestness. And the process that has thus gone on in Germany goes on\r\nmore or less all over the world.\r\n\r\nThe men and women of the labouring democracy, let us remember, have,\r\nmany of them, known hunger and privation in every form, not only as an\r\nexceptionally severe occurrence in times of strike and unemployment, but\r\nas a chronic experience. Mothers have been obliged to work hard too long\r\nbefore child-bearing, and too soon after it, to eke out a scanty family\r\nincome. For a society that has shown so little respect even for the\r\nsacred function of motherhood, what can we say but that it is time to\r\nrepent? The children in the same competitive society have cried for\r\nbread when there was none to give them, and have not had rags enough\r\ndecently to cover their nakedness.\r\n\r\nIn a moment of feeling at the Jena meeting of his party Bebel confessed\r\nthat for years it was his ideal for once to eat his fill of bread and\r\nbutter. During the sieges of Kimberley and Mafeking our countrymen had a\r\nnew experience; they found out what it meant never to have enough to\r\neat, to be always hungry. The leader of one of the strongest\r\norganisations in the world, one of the foremost orators in Europe, to\r\nwhom all men listen when he makes a speech, had the experience for years\r\nin the very heart of modern civilisation.\r\n\r\nThe same children who were thus early acquainted with hunger have gone\r\nto be racked at the mill of labour before they were eight, or even six\r\nyears of age. We need not wonder that they were stunted and dwarfed in\r\ngrowth, that they were wrinkled, deformed, attenuated, grey, and\r\ndecrepit before their time; and they have suffered all this hunger and\r\nprivation through a long agony of years, they and their fathers and\r\nmothers before them, while the classes which have held economic and\r\npolitical power have wasted the means so much needed for worthier uses\r\nin war and in the preparation for war, in the luxury and extravagance of\r\nsociety and of courts.\r\n\r\nNor has this condition of rags, hunger, and privation come to an end. We\r\nmay see it in the course of a casual walk in almost any quarter of any\r\nof the towns of Great Britain to-day.\r\n\r\nIn many countries the democracy assumes a more serious and a menacing\r\nform. Among the trade unions of France there is a pronounced distrust in\r\nthe efficacy of parliamentary action and a predilection for more direct\r\nand energetic methods. We see a like tendency in a stronger form in\r\nItaly. The new Italy has endeavoured to play a rôle as a great military\r\nand naval power, for which she was hardly fitted by her natural\r\nresources or her economic development. A large majority of her people\r\nsuffer all the miseries that flow from extreme ignorance, poverty, and\r\ndegradation. Strikes, riots, and other tumultuary outbreaks have been\r\nput down by the police and the soldiers with a rough hand. The misery of\r\nthe people of Italy finds expression in a very large emigration. In a\r\nsingle year as many as 270,000 go abroad, chiefly to the countries of\r\nCentral Europe, for a period of six months, while 350,000 leave the\r\ncountry as permanent emigrants, chiefly to America. We must regard them\r\nas driven by poverty and hunger rather than impelled by the spirit of\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nBut the most active revolutionary centre of Europe has now shifted\r\neastwards. In Russia the development of modern methods of industry has\r\nonly added to the depth and intensity of the struggle. Great capitalists\r\nhave joined the great landlords in giving support to the Czardom and the\r\nbureaucracy in the mighty conflict with the growing revolutionary\r\nparties which represent rural and town workers. It has been an appalling\r\nstruggle, in which the oldest forms of rule have contended with the\r\nnewest forces of change. What the end may be no man can foresee. So long\r\nas the Czardom receives adequate support from the military forces it may\r\ncontinue to survive, but the course of the revolution has shown that the\r\nloyalty of army and fleet has been seriously shaken. The Socialist\r\nRevolutionary Party contemplate a victory of the working class led by\r\nthem, and in case of necessity the provisional establishment of its\r\nrevolutionary dictatorship. But we may fear that the anarchy which might\r\nensue on the overthrow of the Czardom might lead to the supremacy of a\r\nmilitary chief. In either case the danger to the neighbouring countries,\r\nand especially to South-Eastern Europe, already distracted by racial\r\ndifferences, is only too obvious.\r\n\r\nIn a well-informed article on the rising of the Roumanian peasantry in\r\n1907 the _Spectator_ said that their cause was the cause of a hundred\r\nmillion of peasantry in Eastern Europe. The remark was a true one. The\r\nrevolt of labour in Russia is for the most part a rising of peasants for\r\n‘land and liberty.’ It has been a rising full of terror, of omen, and of\r\nwarning to all who undertake the rule and guidance of men. In Eastern\r\nEurope Enceladus has risen. Long buried under heavy mountain loads of\r\nprivation, of oppression, and of neglect even worse than oppression, he\r\nhas risen to claim his rights. If well guided he might have been a\r\nkindly and beneficent giant, for the Russian peasant is essentially\r\ngood-humoured and well-disposed. But the powers that be have contented\r\nthemselves with the exaction of recruits and taxes, of labour and rent.\r\nThey have otherwise done nothing for him, and have given him no scope\r\nfor doing anything for himself. With little light or guidance, too\r\nfrequently suffering the worst privations of cold and famine, and goaded\r\nby the sense of immemorial wrong, he could not be expected to resist the\r\nfiery draughts from the winepress of the revolution, and he committed\r\nsuch excesses as we know! The Czardom and its servants have prevailed.\r\nThe giant has been driven back to his prison. He is neither dead nor\r\nasleep, but lies moaning and restless on his bed of pain. He will rise\r\nagain!\r\n\r\nThe Socialist Revolutionary Party declare that it is from no love for\r\nsanguinary methods that they have taken up arms. It was their stern duty\r\nbefore the revolution, before the cause of the workers. It was a\r\ndecision serious and full of responsibility. The party ‘will not cease\r\nto employ terrorist tactics in the political struggle till the\r\nestablishment of institutions which will make the will of the people the\r\nsource of power and of legislation.’\r\n\r\nIts task has been to lead the masses of the people in revolt, and it has\r\ndone so with a resolution and self-sacrifice seldom equalled in history.\r\nIts members have been ready to kill and to be killed. There can be no\r\ndoubt that the revolutionary feeling in Russia has increased enormously\r\nin depth and width since the days of Alexander II. The composition of\r\nthe second Duma, which was probably the most revolutionary assembly that\r\nhas ever met on this planet, was a proof and symptom of the extent to\r\nwhich the spirit of revolt had spread. Out of 500 members 200 belonged\r\nto the left, and of these 60 were social democrats, 40 socialist\r\nrevolutionaries, 15 populist socialists, and 60 were labour men, the\r\nsmall remainder being independent radicals. But the same spirit of\r\nrevolution has pervaded rural and town workers, has penetrated to fleet\r\nand army, to the teachers and the intellectual classes. We may be\r\nassured that the drama of the revolution is not ended. The revolution\r\nhas been spreading among a population of 135,000,000 having racial\r\naffinities with numerous peoples in Central and South-Eastern Europe.\r\nThe Ukase of November 1906, which gave the right to every member of a\r\nvillage community to claim complete possession of his present allotment\r\nas permanent private property, will, so far as it is operative, tend\r\ngreatly to aggravate the unrest. It will disintegrate the village\r\ncommunity, break up old forms of life, give more power to the village\r\nusurer, and in many ways add to the violence of the revolutionary\r\nforces. Enceladus will rise again, with results to Russia and to Europe\r\nthat no man can forecast.\r\n\r\nThe division into two nations of Rich and Poor, which the Earl of\r\nBeaconsfield described in his novel, _Sybil_, as existing in England,\r\nhas become international. A chasm more or less wide and abrupt extends\r\nthroughout the civilised world. Even Japan now has an active socialist\r\nparty, and when the industrial revolution has fairly begun to run its\r\ncourse in China we may expect to see its people among the foremost in\r\nthe social revolution. The real economic and political power still lies\r\nin the hands of a small minority, while over against it stands the\r\ndemocracy composed of workers who are every day advancing in\r\nintelligence, in organisation, and in the resolute endeavour towards a\r\ncommon goal. Wealth, power, and enjoyment go together. Labour is\r\nattended by poverty and privation.\r\n\r\nA great struggle is going on, and there can be no doubt that it will go\r\non. How is it to be fought out? This is the supreme question which the\r\ntwentieth century must try to solve.\r\n\r\nIt is of unspeakable importance that it should take a wise and peaceful\r\ncourse. In all countries which have a genuine system of universal\r\nsuffrage fairly carried out, a peaceful solution is practicable. But for\r\nsuch a peaceful solution it will be necessary that all autocratic and\r\nbureaucratic government should cease, and that an executive, not only\r\nformally responsible to the people but really responsive to their\r\nwishes, and in close touch with them, should be established. Such a\r\ngovernment could accomplish a beneficent social and economic\r\ntransformation without violence, without spoliation or confiscation,\r\nwithout even giving an undue shock to the reasonable claims and habits\r\nof any section of the people. This might be effected by a truly\r\ndemocratic government, or by the steady pressure of the democracy on the\r\nold governments, which would be gradually changed. So much for the\r\npeaceful transformation of the State.\r\n\r\nMay we not also expect that socialists will take a more serious and\r\nenlightened view of their responsibilities in aspiring to lead organised\r\nlabour, and may we not in the course of time hope for a modification of\r\ntheir aims and methods? If these were more reasonable, they would\r\nobviously be more convincing, and the prospects of a peaceful as well as\r\na successful issue would be vastly increased. At present their demands\r\nare often so put in elaborate programmes, in language more or less\r\ntechnical, that they repel the sympathy even of reasonable men. To use a\r\ncommon saying, socialism as frequently presented is such ‘a big order,’\r\nexpressed in alien language, that men with the best will in the world\r\ncannot give it a hospitable welcome to their minds.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it is not a paradox but the plain truth that socialists are now\r\nthe greatest obstacle to the progress of their ideal. Nor is this at all\r\nstrange. The same thing has happened in the development of all great\r\nideals; men are too little for them, and in their love for forms and\r\ndogmas forget and even repudiate or suppress the spirit. For the\r\nprogress of socialism the thing most needful now is to throw off the\r\ntechnical dogmatic and ultra-revolutionary form which it has inherited\r\nfrom the past, and to study the real needs and live issues of the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nSocialism is still coloured to its detriment by excessive loyalty to\r\nMarx, and the views of Marx were shaped by a time which has passed away.\r\nIn the early forties, when the system of Marx was taking form, idealism\r\nhad declined, and a very crude dogmatic materialism was in the\r\nascendant. The very active speculation which had previously been\r\ndirected to the ideal, attempted to work in the real and material\r\nwithout due preparation on a very inadequate basis of facts—with\r\nstrange results! A fierce militant revolutionary spirit, which in the\r\ncircumstances must be regarded as very natural, was preparing for the\r\ntroubles of 1848. Ricardo, a man singularly deficient in the requisite\r\nhistorical and philosophical training, was the reigning power in\r\neconomic theory. Under such influences the views of Marx were\r\nprematurely shaped into the dogmatic system which we know. He continued\r\nto hold and develop them without any real attempt at self-criticism in\r\nriper years, and he, an exile living in England, forcibly urged them\r\nfrom his study on the socialist groups and parties of the Continent.\r\n\r\nIn his manifesto of the Communist party, Marx declares that the\r\nproletariat has nothing to lose but its chains. It has been the\r\nunfortunate destiny of him and his school to forge new chains for the\r\nworking class in the shape of dogmatic materialism, a rigid and abstract\r\ncollectivism, and ultra-revolutionary views, which still hamper it in\r\nthe task of emancipation. The promptitude with which the emancipators of\r\nthe human race have provided new chains is strange enough. Still\r\nstranger is the readiness men have shown in putting them on! As we have\r\nseen in a previous chapter, the followers of Marx have gone further in\r\nthis way than their chief.[3]\r\n\r\nAn ill service was done to the working class by utterances on marriage\r\nand the family, which gave the ruling classes who keep the workers out\r\nof their rights the plea that they were maintaining the fundamental\r\nprinciples of social order. The abstract collectivism which is the\r\nprominent economic feature of his school suggests two serious doubts: if\r\nby a revolutionary act they took the delicate and complex social\r\nmechanism to pieces, whether they would be able to put it together\r\nagain; and if they did succeed in putting it together, whether it would\r\nwork. The same devotion to abstract collectivism has made his followers\r\nunable to draw up a reasonable agrarian policy suitable to the\r\npeasantry. Their hostility to religion, expressed most freely in the\r\nearly years of the agitation in Germany and elsewhere, has been a\r\nserious hindrance to their progress, both among Catholics and\r\nProtestants, especially the former.\r\n\r\nThus in many directions their propaganda has been an obstacle to their\r\nsuccess in their proper task of emancipating the working class, and it\r\nhas at the same time been a hindrance to the peaceful solution of the\r\ngreat struggle. The great central problem has been confused by side\r\nissues and irrelevant matter. We can best show how tragic has been the\r\nconfusion of parts and of issues by reference to religion. Love,\r\nbrotherhood, mutual service, and peace are most prominent notes in the\r\nteaching of Jesus. They must be woven into the moral texture of\r\nsocialism if it is to succeed and be a benefit to the world. If Marx and\r\nhis school had merely attacked what we may call the official and\r\nprofessional representatives of the Christian Church, they would have\r\nbeen within their rights. As it has been, the religion of love,\r\nbrotherhood, and mutual service has officially become part of a\r\ngovernment system by which the hereditary oppressors of the poor in\r\nGermany and elsewhere claim to continue their unblest work. The\r\nprofessional representatives of Christ’s teaching support and encourage\r\nthem in it, and so make themselves accomplices, not only in the\r\noppression and degradation of the poor, but in war and militarism, and\r\nin all the waste, extravagance, and misdirection of class government.\r\nHow many of them are conscious of the profound incongruity of their\r\nposition?\r\n\r\nIn the history of human thought opinion has hardened often prematurely\r\ninto dogma, and dogma has usually degenerated into pedantry. Dogma has\r\noften been simply the expression of egotism, which had not the saving\r\ngrace either to be loyal to truth or really helpful to mankind. So it\r\nhas been in the development of socialism. Its champions have too\r\nfrequently failed in keeping a single eye and mind on a task which\r\nrequires insight, self-restraint, loyalty, and consistency, as well as\r\nenergy and enthusiasm. A great cause demands the best and noblest\r\nservice. Such a cause as socialism demands from its supporters the\r\nself-denial which will suppress the many phases of an excessive,\r\ndisorderly, morbid, and malignant egotism that has done so much harm in\r\nthe past—no easy task for human nature.\r\n\r\nIt is a very serious result alike of the past history and of the present\r\npolicy of socialists that the practical work of emancipating labour has\r\nto such a degree been postponed to a remote and hypothetical future.\r\nThey form only a small minority in the legislatures of the leading\r\nEuropean countries. This minority is increasing, and is likely to\r\nincrease. But there is no present probability of an increase that would\r\nwin political power by parliamentary action.\r\n\r\nAccording to the prevalent socialism the goal of the whole movement is\r\nto acquire possession of the means of production. Such a conception lays\r\nexcessive stress on the dead and passive instruments of labour. It\r\nascribes too much importance to the economic factor. The economic factor\r\nis most important, but the cardinal thing in socialism is the living and\r\nactive principle of association, and the essential thing for the working\r\nman to acquire is the capacity and habit of association. In other words,\r\nthe motive power of socialism must be found in the mind and character of\r\nmen guided by science and inspired by the highest ethical ideals, and\r\nwho have attained to the insight and capacity requisite for associated\r\naction.\r\n\r\nBut in making those criticisms let us remember that the social democracy\r\nis still in its unformed youth. The socialist parties of most European\r\ncountries have sprung up since 1870. They have had, through much labour\r\nand tribulation, to shape their organisation, principles, and policy.\r\nHow natural it was that they should follow a master mind like Marx, who\r\nhad manfully and unsparingly devoted his entire life to their cause! And\r\nhow natural too that they should have no trust in other classes, and\r\nrefuse all manner of compromise with them!\r\n\r\nAnd we should fail in an accurate presentation of our subject if we did\r\nnot emphasise the fact that the present position of labour is the result\r\nof a vast effort of practical and constructive work. In all departments\r\nlabour had to start from the very beginning not many years ago. The\r\nsocialist parties with their programmes represent a strenuous and\r\npainful process of thought and organisation. Through the trade unions\r\nthe ill-informed, untrained, suspicious, and turbulent democracy of\r\nlabour has been drilled into habits of common action. How much of\r\nenthusiasm and high principle, of persevering toil and patient attention\r\nto detail has been put into the co-operative movement!\r\n\r\nThere are now most significant symptoms that all the diverse forms of\r\nworking-class activity are being consolidated into one great movement.\r\nWe have seen how in Belgium trade unions and co-operative societies work\r\nin harmony with the socialist party. So they also do in Denmark. In\r\nItaly the three classic forms of labour activity, trade unionism,\r\nco-operation, and the Friendly Society, have come to an understanding\r\nwhich is inspired by socialist aims. Generally we may say that the\r\ntendency in all countries is for organised labour to become socialistic.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all countries the interests of the rural workers have been by\r\nsocialists neglected or sacrificed for the industrial workers. This is\r\nparticularly observable in agrarian questions and questions of tariff.\r\nThey have not seen that at least temporary legislation has been required\r\nto save the rural workers from ruin by the exceptional competition of\r\ncheap farm products from America. Generally they have considered the\r\ninterests of the workers as consumers rather than as producers. The\r\nSocialist Revolutionary Party in Russia have, however, seriously faced\r\nthe agrarian problem in their programme in language of carefully\r\ncalculated vagueness. Proceeding from the basis of the old communal\r\nownership, they advocate the socialisation of all land under an\r\nadministration of popular self-government, central and local. ‘The use\r\nof the land will be based on labour and the principle of equality, that\r\nis to say, it will guarantee the satisfaction of the needs of the\r\nproducer, working himself individually or in society.’ Rent will be used\r\nfor collective needs. The subsoil will belong to the State. In Finland,\r\nwhich is the most socialistic country of Europe, the Social Democratic\r\nParty has also specially dealt with the agrarian question.\r\n\r\nWhile it has hitherto been the too general tendency of socialists to\r\ndistrust and oppose the existing system of government and\r\nadministration, they are now in point of fact taking a larger part in\r\nthe work of state and commune. Such work, like all other practical work,\r\nwill serve as a wholesome discipline for parties whose energies have\r\nbeen too much expended and wasted in sterile opposition and unprofitable\r\ncriticism. And it may lead them to see that the antagonism of other\r\nparties may be due to honest ignorance or well-justified doubt. Even in\r\nGermany Bebel admits that so much intercourse in the Reichstag and its\r\ncommittees between Social Democrats and the other parties has led to a\r\nfriendlier feeling among them. But the main point that we wish to bring\r\nout here is that organised and progressive labour in all countries and\r\nin all its departments, trade unions, co-operative societies, etc., is\r\nbeing more and more inspired by socialistic aims, and tends more and\r\nmore to form a solid and organic movement on practical lines. How far\r\nthe movement may in the future conform or attain to the collectivist\r\ntype remains to be seen.\r\n\r\nWe must particularly emphasise the fact that nothing adverse to a\r\nreasonable patriotism, to religion, marriage, or the family, is now\r\nfound in the programmes of parties or in the resolutions of congresses.\r\nThe International and the Socialist Parties clearly recognise that their\r\ntask is the emancipation of labour, and that it is of an economic and\r\npolitical nature. Those who mix up this great problem with questions of\r\nreligion and marriage do so on their own responsibility. They have no\r\nright to speak on behalf of socialism, and have no influence or\r\nauthority beyond what they may personally possess.\r\n\r\nIn our review we have had much to say of the possibilities of\r\nrevolution. To all who shrink from sudden change the experience of the\r\nLabour Party in Australia should be reassuring. The Labour Party of the\r\nCommonwealth attained to power in 1904 and again in 1908. But the Party\r\nwhen in power can do very little. It is only one of three or four\r\nparties. When in power it must depend on outside support. Thus do the\r\ndesires and ideals of men find their limitations in human nature and in\r\nour environment. What men have most to fear as the greatest danger,\r\nparticularly in English-speaking lands, is not sudden change, but the\r\nindifference and neglect which make change slow and inadequate. The\r\nefforts of labour to raise itself deserve our entire sympathy and our\r\nmost careful study.\r\n\r\nForce devoid of counsel, whether it be of the reaction or of the\r\nrevolution, will only result in increase of evil. Evil in itself each\r\ntends to aggravate and perpetuate the other. We can avert the baneful\r\nconsequences of both only by pursuing with temperate energy the course\r\nof well-considered and beneficent change. To guide the vast and\r\never-growing labour movement of the world into paths which shall be\r\nwise, righteous, peaceful, and happy, this is the task and, we hope,\r\nwill be the achievement of the twentieth century. Happy the men who have\r\nthe good-will, sympathy, and insight to make a worthy contribution to\r\nthis great work!\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[1] See p. 316.\r\n\r\n[2] See _Inquiry into Socialism_, 3rd ed. p. 96.\r\n\r\n[3] See p. 313.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n                               CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter we have seen how in many lands the social democracy\r\nis seeking to reach its goal by parliamentary action, and how in France,\r\nItaly, and Russia the socialist movement tends less or more to assume an\r\naggressive and violent form. We have seen how socialism is everywhere\r\nbecoming the creed of organised labour. The socialist parties and the\r\ntrade unions are the organised and articulate expression of the labour\r\nof the world, and they are being combined into one great movement. We\r\nmust, therefore, understand the socialist movement as having its basis\r\nand its background in a vast reality which as yet has only partially\r\nfound voice and organisation. One of the most striking features in\r\nrecent history is to be found in the symptoms which so frequently appear\r\nof a latent and undefined socialism, which only needs a fitting occasion\r\nto call it forth, and which forms a serious but incalculable quantity in\r\nthe forces of our time. In these symptoms the seeing eye can discern\r\nlabour moving uneasily under its chronic burden. The unorganised labour\r\nbreaks out in street riots and agrarian risings. Labour partially\r\norganised in Russia shows an intense revolutionary energy. While the\r\nprevalent socialism seeks to gain its ends by peaceful action the\r\nsituation contains serious possibilities of revolution, especially in\r\nEastern Europe.\r\n\r\nIt behoves all men of good-will in every country to ponder the extreme\r\ngravity of the situation which is being established throughout the\r\ncivilised world. Are we to face a confused struggle of the old sort\r\nbetween those who have and those who have not, or are we to see the\r\nblessed and beneficent action of a great transforming principle? Is it\r\nto be a contest for the possession of political power, carried on with\r\nviolence, and pregnant with incalculable disaster to all concerned? Or\r\nmay we expect to watch the peaceful progress of a new type of industry\r\ngradually but effectually realised, under the guidance of men inspired\r\nby high economic and ethical ideals?\r\n\r\nIn England we have good ground to hope for a peaceful solution. Among\r\nour working classes there is a notable absence of rancour, and even of\r\nbitterness. But it would be very unwise to count upon the continuance of\r\nthis spirit, and most unfair to make it an occasion or excuse for\r\nfurther neglect. It should rather be a stimulus to a truer appreciation\r\nof the position and needs of the working class. If we survey English\r\nhistory to the beginning of the nineteenth century, our main difficulty\r\nis to determine whether our sins of omission or commission have been the\r\ngreater. Both have been heinous and enormous. In the village community\r\nas it existed long ago we see comprehended all that we now call land,\r\nlabour, and capital. For the worker it performed the services that are\r\nnow rendered by the trade union, the co-operative society, the friendly\r\nand benefit society, and the insurance society. It stood also for local\r\ngovernment, and even to a large degree for what now is national\r\ngovernment, defence, justice, and for education so far as was possible\r\nlong ago. The economic, social, and political life of the men of those\r\nearliest times was summed up in the village community.\r\n\r\nOn the rise of feudalism this village community was transformed into the\r\nmanor, and on the downfall of feudalism the manor was changed to the\r\nmodern parish, definable as ‘a distinct area, in which a separate\r\npoor-rate is, or can be, levied.’ For a long period after the Black\r\nDeath in 1349 labour was scarce and had a great opportunity. Through the\r\nconversion of small holdings into sheep-runs and the dissolution of the\r\nmonasteries, labour was made superfluous and helpless. It was a tragic\r\nreversal of the situation which has had serious consequences during all\r\nthe centuries that have followed. The opportunities and advantages which\r\nwere offered to the worker in ancient times by the village community\r\nwere at the close of the reign of Elizabeth reduced to the miserable\r\nprivilege of poor relief! The worker could not be regarded as included\r\nwithin the body politic or social. He was no longer a citizen or member\r\nof the community. He was a landless serf, the subject of the landed\r\nclass, and his position was determined by class legislation and class\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nWhen the change came from class legislation to _laissez faire_, his\r\nposition was little improved. Centuries of oppression were followed by\r\ngenerations of neglect. Thus the English workers have suffered in\r\nsuccession from evils of two kinds, from the evils of oppression and\r\nfrom the evils of neglect. This aspect of English history is summed up\r\nand condemned in the single fact that we had no national system of\r\neducation till 1870, a fact all the more striking because Scotland,\r\nthough much later in its political and economic development, had an\r\nenlightened system of education at a very early date.\r\n\r\nFactory workers gained much dining the nineteenth century. But even yet\r\nthe State has hardly done anything substantial for the rural workers.\r\nScarcely a voice has been raised for a class which has borne the chief\r\nburden of national industry, of colonisation and war, which for so many\r\ncenturies carried Church and State, aristocracy and squirearchy, on its\r\nmuch-enduring shoulders. Some of us hoped that in 1885 the time had at\r\nlast come. We all know what happened to defer it again. Will the State\r\nnever give heed to such a duty till the demand grows clamorous and\r\nagitation menacing? No class has done so much and received so little as\r\nthe rural workers. Every man connected with the ruling class in England\r\nshould be ashamed to look one of the peasantry in the face. It is the\r\ncontinual neglect of the needs and claims of the people that makes a\r\npeaceful change difficult and prepares for revolution.\r\n\r\nThere are however, many very promising symptoms. Among these we may note\r\na growing spirit of conciliation and of sympathy with the claims of\r\nlabour, shown particularly in the friendly and courteous reception\r\naccorded to the newly founded Labour Party. In the ruling and possessing\r\nclasses we may observe an increasing recognition of the necessity to\r\nmake substantial concessions to the needs and aspirations of the\r\nworkers. One of the brightest of recent symptoms was the atmosphere,\r\nenlightened, sympathetic, and generous, which pervaded the discussions\r\nat the Pan-Anglican Congress in 1908. It was a sign of the times. No one\r\ncould accuse the Congress of being a revolutionary gathering. We may\r\nexpect that the influence of its members among the conservative and\r\ninfluential classes all over the English-speaking world will have good\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nWe have abundant evidence that the American people have done much hard\r\nthinking on social politics during recent years. A striking instance of\r\nit appears in President Roosevelt’s message to Congress in December\r\n1908. We may summarise as follows the proposals for social legislation\r\nwhich it contained. Besides the general control of the great\r\ncorporations which he has all along urged, he advocated supervision of\r\ncorporate finance, a progressive inheritance tax on large fortunes,\r\nlightening of the burden of taxation on the small man, prohibition of\r\nchild labour, diminution of woman labour, shortening of hours of all\r\nmechanical labour, an eight hours’ day to be extended as soon and as far\r\nas practicable to the entire work to be carried on by Government. He\r\nparticularly urges the immediate passing of an effective Employers’\r\nLiability Act. This is a good beginning, and it is a happy omen that\r\nsuch legislation should be advocated by a man with so fearless and\r\nstainless a record as Mr. Roosevelt. If the American people are prepared\r\nto follow him a beneficent solution of many grave problems is assured.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing pages we have discussed the State as a possible engine\r\nof social amelioration. But we should not forget that the most hopeful\r\nmovement of recent times, the co-operative movement, owes little to the\r\nState. The State has very great power, but it has no magical power. And\r\nit is a grave mistake to regard it too much as the pivot of social\r\nevolution. The State itself is only a phase of social evolution. We can\r\ntrace its rise and progress in history, and its record has not been a\r\ngood one. While it has been a decisive element of strength in the\r\nstruggle for existence, it has also too long and too much been an organ\r\nfor the exploiting of the mass of the people by the ruling minority.\r\n\r\nRecent English socialism has given excessive prominence to the State; to\r\nthe prejudice of the question, and for two reasons. The State means\r\ncompulsion, and it suggests the official. Socialism carried out by the\r\nState suggests bureaucracy, and is opposed to freedom. Such a conception\r\nof the subject is most misleading and in the highest degree prejudicial\r\nto progress.\r\n\r\nIn its propaganda the Fabian Society has too often interpreted socialism\r\nin terms of the State and the municipality. Though most important, the\r\nState and the municipality are only historic phases of deeper principles\r\nand forces. It may be a way to make the subject intelligible. But this\r\nconvenience is more than counterbalanced by the tactical disadvantage\r\nthat orators on the other side find an easy way of ‘confuting’\r\nsocialism, by asking how the State or municipality can grapple with the\r\nvast complexity of modern industry, and how freedom could be conserved\r\nunder the compulsory action of the State and its officials.\r\n\r\nThe proposal in the Fabian Basis to transfer industrial capital to the\r\ncommunity ‘without compensation’ is open to still wider and more serious\r\nobjection. The claim of socialism to be the future form of industrial\r\norganisation rests on its superior efficiency. It claims to prevail\r\nbecause it is best, and it needs no arbitrary exercise of power to carry\r\nit through. Theoretically and practically, from an economic and\r\npolitical, social, and moral point of view, it lays claim to superior\r\ncompetence to do the best for mankind by giving fuller scope to the\r\nfree, many-sided development of the highest human life. In this and in\r\nother points the language of the Fabian Basis is too suggestive of the\r\nrigid and abstract collectivism set forth in the prevalent socialism.\r\n\r\nIf we are to understand the true inwardness of our subject we must go\r\nbehind the State. Rightly understood, socialism is concerned with\r\nprinciples and tendencies which are more fundamental than the State. As\r\nI have said in another place, ‘Socialism is a new type of social and\r\neconomic organisation, the aim and tendency of which are to reform the\r\nexisting society, the State included. It is a principle of social change\r\nwhich goes beyond and behind the existing State, which will modify the\r\nState, but does not depend upon it for its realisation.’[1] To be more\r\nprecise, socialism is a principle of economic organisation, with the\r\ncorrelated social and ethical principles constituting a great ideal, to\r\nwhich the State must be made to conform. How far the State may in this\r\nway need to be transformed is a question which hardly concerns us at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on the Purified Socialism I attempted to show how ‘the\r\ntrue meaning of socialism is given in the dominating tendencies of\r\nsocial evolution.’[2] Through the fog of controversy we should clearly\r\nsee that the fundamental principle of socialism is marked by extreme\r\nsimplicity. The keynote of socialism is the principle of association.\r\nOnly by associating for the ownership and control of land and capital\r\ncan the people protect themselves against the evils of competition and\r\nmonopoly. Only by association can they control and utilise the large\r\nindustry for the general good. It means that industry should be carried\r\non by free associated workers utilising a joint capital with a view to\r\nan equitable system of distribution. And in the political organisation\r\nof society it has for complement a like ideal, namely, that the old\r\nmethods of force, subjection, and exploitation should give place to the\r\nprinciple of free association. Through the application and development\r\nof the principle of free association it seeks to transform State,\r\nmunicipality, and industry in all their departments.\r\n\r\nSocialism rests on the great ideals of freedom and justice, of\r\nbrotherhood and mutual service. It may well claim to be the heir of the\r\ngreat ideals of the greatest races. The Hebrew ideal of truth,\r\nrighteousness, and mercy, which on its ethical side was widened and\r\ndeepened into the Christian ideals of love, brotherhood, and mutual\r\nservice, and the Greek ideal of the true, the good, and the beautiful,\r\nall may and should be accepted by socialism, and they should be\r\nsupplemented by the Roman conceptions of law, order, and continuity, but\r\nwith far wider aims and meanings. In its law of mutual service, by which\r\nit at once asserted the interdependence of the members of the social\r\norganism and a profound conception of social duty, Christianity went\r\ndeeper, both in philosophy and practice, than the French Revolution with\r\nits watchwords of liberty, equality, and fraternity. All these ideals,\r\nthough not seldom abused and discredited in the rough school of human\r\nexperience, are in their essence profoundly true and real, and they all\r\nmeet and are summed up in a worthy conception of the great socialistic\r\nideal.\r\n\r\nThese ideals, it will be seen, go together; and it should be specially\r\nobserved that freedom for the mass of mankind can be won and maintained\r\nonly by association. In the competitive struggle the victors are few;\r\nthe many are defeated and become subject. It is a delusion to suppose\r\nthat freedom and competition are really compatible.\r\n\r\nThis truth has received striking exemplification in the recent history\r\nof America. In the course of a single generation the country has passed\r\nunder a system of competition from industrial freedom to what looks very\r\nlike industrial oligarchy. The men who could best adapt themselves to\r\nthe conditions of competition have won; and the trusts which they have\r\norganised are the natural results. The oligarchy appears to be the very\r\nunwelcome but very natural result of the free struggle for success which\r\nhas been the accepted system and the ideal of the American people.\r\n\r\nRightly understood, socialism will thus be seen to embody the highest\r\nconceptions of life, ancient and modern, and the highest aspirations of\r\nChristian ethics interpreted and applied by the experience of centuries.\r\nThe failures which we have experienced in realising our ideals are no\r\nexcuse for lowering them. They are far-reaching; they are limited by\r\nobvious natural facts, and cannot be realised in a day. But we should\r\nremember that every step forward brings us nearer to the goal.\r\n\r\nThis great ideal remains, therefore, as a far-shining goal to provoke\r\nand encourage the endeavours of men to attain it. We cannot lower it,\r\nbut we should be grateful for every sincere attempt to reach it, for\r\nevery successful step towards it. For the rise and growth of socialism a\r\nlower and, as some would reckon, a more solid foundation is all that we\r\nneed. The necessary minimum is an enlightened self-interest. Socialism\r\ndoes not aim at the extinguishing or superseding of the self-regarding\r\nprinciple—that is impossible and absurd. It seeks to regulate it, to\r\nplace it under social guidance and control. When and so far as the mass\r\nof the people in any particular country and throughout the world gain a\r\nmoderate, rational, and enlightened view of their real needs and\r\ninterests, then and so far will socialism tend to be realised. While the\r\nelect souls have been and are ready to go far in deeds of heroism and\r\nself-sacrifice, nothing more is demanded of the average mass of mankind\r\nthan to learn to understand their true interests. On this prosaic basis\r\nmuch has already been done.\r\n\r\nWhile the competitive system still holds the field, we have very good\r\ngrounds for thinking that it should pass away, and is passing away. We\r\nhave seen how, in accordance with the fundamental principles of\r\nsocialism, the State is becoming, not in name only, but in reality, an\r\nassociation for the promotion of common national interests, in so far as\r\nthey can well be furthered by the central organ; and we have also seen\r\nhow the municipality or commune is really beginning to perform the same\r\nfunctions for local purposes. In the co-operative system, in the growth\r\nof trade unions, of arbitration, boards of conciliation, and similar\r\nforms of organisation, we see partial efforts towards a comprehensive\r\nsystem of social control over the industrial processes. And the natural\r\ndevelopment of the company is providing the mechanism whereby it may\r\nalso be placed under social management. It is clear that along these\r\nlines the movement may spread till it cover the whole field of our\r\nsocial-economic life and place the competitive spirit under an effective\r\nand reasonable regulation.\r\n\r\nIt may be well here to speak more at length regarding the functions of\r\nthe State under a rational socialism. Of all the absurdities entertained\r\nabout socialism by its critics, and apparently also by some of its\r\nadherents, the most grotesque is the idea that everything will be done\r\nby the direct action of the State. It will rather be the aim of a\r\nreasonable socialism to diminish and lighten the pressure of the State\r\nas an engine of compulsion and coercion, and to offer suitable scope for\r\nthe free action of the individual and the family, for free association\r\nand voluntary agreement. For this reason one of the most urgent needs of\r\nsuch a socialism will be to promote local autonomy, and also to foster\r\nwhat we may call the autonomy of the individual and the family, but in a\r\nliving organic relation to the whole community.\r\n\r\nWe must therefore regard social action as proceeding not only from above\r\ndownwards, but also from below upwards, and indeed mutually and\r\nreciprocally through all the members and departments of society, from\r\nthe centre to the extremities and from the extremities to the centre.\r\nBut even this is only a very imperfect explanation of an organic process\r\nwhich expresses itself in a consensus of life and action.\r\n\r\nThe federal idea also very imperfectly expresses the relation that the\r\nparts may bear to each other and to the whole in a great society, but it\r\nhelps us to understand. This federal conception may have a great future,\r\nin Austria-Hungary, in Russia, and in the Balkan Peninsula, for the\r\nsolution of political difficulties. The British Empire is being\r\ntransformed into a free association of free States. And we may add that\r\nthe highest directing agency in the Empire, the British Cabinet, is a\r\ncombination of the leading men of the strongest party for the time\r\nbeing, who in the main hold the same political views, and who are\r\nunited, not according to a statute or a written constitution, or any\r\nkind of formal contract, but by what for want of a better name we may\r\ncall a gentlemen’s agreement. The British Cabinet may be regarded as a\r\nfree association of gentlemen, the Premier presiding _primus inter\r\npares_.\r\n\r\nAs regards socialism, one of the most urgent needs for the promoting of\r\nlocal and individual autonomy is fully to reconstitute the homestead and\r\nthe village community. The homestead will satisfy the most natural\r\ncraving for individual property and for a family and ancestral home,\r\nwith all the beneficent and sacred association implied in such a home.\r\n‘The area of the homestead should be sufficient to employ and support a\r\nfamily.’ In my book _Progress and the Fiscal Problem_ (p. 172) I have\r\nspoken of such a homestead as a freehold. But it matters comparatively\r\nlittle what legal term we employ, provided the occupancy be permanent\r\nand not dependent on the will of officials connected with the central\r\ngovernment. There should, however, be some guarantee that the social\r\nconditions of occupancy be fulfilled. Tax or rent might reasonably be\r\npaid into a social fund for collective needs. Here, as in other matters,\r\none of the difficulties in elucidating a reasonable socialism lies in\r\nthe fact that we have to use old words to express facts and institutions\r\nthat may be expected to become new, or at least to undergo a material\r\nchange in the course of social development. For such words, it should be\r\nobserved, have not a final and conclusive meaning which can be\r\nstereotyped and put into a definition in a dictionary or legal\r\nenactment, but can only be unfolded in actual human use and in the\r\nprocess of changing human history. It is meant that the homestead and\r\nthe village community be restored to a full and beneficent life under\r\nmodern conditions and to serve modern needs.\r\n\r\nOf the State for the near future the most desirable type undoubtedly is\r\none which, while providing a strong and efficient central organisation,\r\ngives a real and substantial autonomy to the various parts and members\r\nof which it may be composed. And it will be one of the noblest functions\r\nof such a State to train to a higher social and political life the\r\npeoples which are now subject and by some are reckoned inferior. This\r\nduty Great Britain is performing in India and Egypt. The United States\r\nof America have undertaken a like office in Cuba and the Philippine\r\nIslands. It might even be possible under wise guidance to lead peoples\r\nlike the Kaffirs direct from the warlike and tribal stage into the\r\nindustrial and co-operative stage. Some day, perhaps, the best solution\r\nfor racial difficulties in America may be to give some kind of special\r\nautonomy to the negroes in the hot regions where they are most thickly\r\nplanted near the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nProgress in these high matters will obviously depend on the growing\r\ninsight and sympathy of the rulers, as well as on the increasing\r\nenlightenment, self-control, and political experience of the subject\r\nraces. It is a most important matter that the task has been worthily\r\nbegun. Such work is in quality like mercy—\r\n\r\n                              It is twice blest:\r\n    It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.\r\n\r\nIt will most effectually tend to cultivate the nobler political life in\r\nthe States that have undertaken it, and we may believe that it will in\r\nthe course of time train the more backward races in the higher life of\r\nself-government, and introduce among them the co-operative organisation\r\nof industry which is required by modern conditions. In all this we see a\r\nstriking contrast to the older empires, in which the domination of race,\r\nnation, and class was twice cursed, a curse alike to rulers and ruled,\r\nto master and slave, to lord and serf. In these matters generally a\r\nreasonable socialism demands the transformation of empire into a free\r\nassociation of free States bound by ties of mutual service. For a fuller\r\ntreatment of this idea I may refer my readers to the chapter ‘Bonds of\r\nEmpire’ in my book _South Africa Old and New_ (p. 95).\r\n\r\nReferring to questions which were raised in other parts of this book, we\r\nbelieve that recent modifications in the Iron Law of Wages, which have\r\nbeen alleged in confutation of Lassalle’s position, are really symptoms\r\nof the decline of capitalism. Such modifications are due to influences\r\nwhich are inconsistent with the continued predominance of capitalism.\r\nAnd here we may say explicitly that socialism has no controversy with\r\nthe prevalent political economy in so far as it is a correct description\r\nand analysis of the prevalent economic system. The aim of socialism is\r\nto show why and how that system should and must pass away, and is\r\npassing away; and we may believe that this is a much worthier task, from\r\nthe point of view both of science and the public good, than the\r\nmicroscopic investigation of the conditions of the competitive system,\r\nwhich constitutes so large a portion of the current political economy.\r\nAnyhow the practical aim of socialism is to remove and abolish the\r\nconditions under which the so-called laws of political economy had their\r\nvalidity. Regarding the assumption so often made by economists that\r\nindividual self-interest is the solid basis on which science must build,\r\nwe can only say that it is not science, but a one-sided and erroneous\r\nconception of human nature, of human society, and of social evolution,\r\nwhich obviously requires the most serious correction.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the population question, and the question of the struggle\r\nfor existence so intimately connected with it, we can no longer ignore\r\nthe practice of limitation of families, which has now become so\r\nprevalent. It cannot be regarded as a satisfactory solution of the\r\npopulation question. In the past it has been one of the surest signs of\r\na stagnant and decadent nation. No race or nation, in which the rights\r\nand duties of motherhood or the family moralities are slightly valued,\r\ncan hope permanently to maintain a high standard of life and worth. We\r\nmay most surely forecast the future of a class or nation from the manner\r\nin which the rights and duties of motherhood are observed by it. To use\r\nthe language of biology, race suicide is the most unfavourable variation\r\nwhich classes and nations can inflict upon themselves. But we are not in\r\nthis book concerned with the general question. What we have to note here\r\nis that the practice of limiting families, having become so prevalent,\r\nwill tend to diminish the intensity of the struggle for existence, which\r\nit is the aim of socialism to regulate. For this reason we must\r\nrecognise it as a fact which has an important bearing on our subject.\r\n\r\nIt was a theory of the Marx school that the _bourgeoisie_, in the course\r\nof the development of capitalism, would be ‘no longer capable of\r\ncontrolling the industrial world.’[3] The recent development of the\r\ntrust system in America and Germany has shown that the _bourgeoisie_ are\r\nonly too capable of doing so on the vastest scale. The leaders of the\r\ntrusts are showing that they can regulate production, wages, prices, and\r\nthe markets, not for nations only but for the world. Oligarchies showed\r\ntheir capacity in Rome, Carthage, Venice, and Holland for centuries.\r\nThey came to ruin at last, but the causes of their ruin were wider and\r\ndeeper than mere want of capacity. With these we are not concerned here.\r\nThe concern of socialism is that the oligarchy or plutocracy which is\r\nforeshadowed in the gigantic trust system should not be allowed to gain\r\na permanent footing, but should be regulated and transformed in the way\r\nrequired by the public good. The trust is a menace alike to labour and\r\nto society. With the growth of the trust system free competition really\r\nceases to exist, and the alternative lies between a gigantic system of\r\nmonopoly and socialism.\r\n\r\nWe believe also that Marx made a serious mistake in holding that the\r\nfurther development of capitalism will be marked by the growing\r\n‘wretchedness, oppression, slavery, degeneracy, and exploitation’[4] of\r\nthe working class. Facts and reasonable expectations combine clearly to\r\nindicate that the democracy, on which the social evolution of the future\r\ndepends, is marked by a growing intellectual, moral, and political\r\ncapacity, and by an increasing freedom and prosperity; and all these\r\nthings make it only more ardent and capable for further progress and for\r\nthe great tasks that lie before it. Social progress must in the last\r\nresort depend on the character and capacity of the human beings\r\nconcerned in it. The democracy, the representative and promoter of the\r\nnew order, shows a growing fitness for its world-historic mission. The\r\nclaim of socialism to be the dominant form of social organisation in the\r\nfuture must ultimately be its efficiency to fulfil the great ends of\r\nsocial union, and the decisive element in this efficiency must be the\r\nfitness of the agents who are to realise it.\r\n\r\nThis is a point of supreme and far-reaching importance which it will be\r\nwell for us to ponder. All social problems in the long run resolve\r\nthemselves into the question of human character. The moral forces\r\ncontrol the world and the course of history. It has been the special\r\nfunction of socialism to show that a real and durable freedom can be\r\nestablished only on an economic basis. We should also not forget that\r\nsuch freedom can be attained and secured only by loyalty to reason and\r\nespecially to moral law. Freedom and social progress, reason and\r\nmorality, are correlated and organic conceptions which go together and\r\ncan thrive only in harmony.\r\n\r\nGovernment of State and municipality is only a mechanism, of which the\r\naction for good or evil will depend on the spirit by which it is moved.\r\nThe nationalisation of railways may merely open up a new field of\r\ncorruption, if there is not integrity to manage them for the public\r\ngood. Noble ideals are of no avail, if they remain outside of our\r\nspiritual framework: they must be assimilated and become part of us.\r\nFine sentiments, unless they are consolidated into character and\r\ntranslated into habitual action, may become an insidious and harmful\r\nform of self-indulgence. Let it be understood that in the great struggle\r\nfor a really free commonwealth against organised wealth, called\r\nplutocracy, on which men are now entering, we shall achieve victory only\r\nby deserving it. The sacred cause of freedom will not be maintained by\r\nmammon-worshippers, parasites, and pedants. No nation or class whose\r\nwomen are slaves of self-indulgence and of fashion can expect to be\r\nfree. We cannot hope that freedom will thrive among the base and mean,\r\nor the hysterical, irresponsible, frivolous, and apathetic.\r\n\r\nTo use the words of John Milton, it was a ‘strenuous liberty’ which was\r\ncherished and maintained by our Puritan forefathers, the fathers and\r\nfounders of the American Commonwealth. We know with what solemnity and\r\nearnestness, with what gravity, deliberation, and foresight they entered\r\non the long struggle against Stuart tyranny. If the Americans and we are\r\nto succeed in the coming struggle against plutocracy, an abundant\r\nmeasure of the high and virile qualities which characterised their\r\nforefathers and ours will be needed.\r\n\r\nHappily signs are not wanting that a spirit and character strenuous and\r\ncapable of the task of reformation will be forthcoming. In all civilised\r\ncountries, and especially in America, men have been accomplices in the\r\nsin of mammon-worship: success in the struggle for wealth, with its many\r\nbase and unscrupulous incidents, has been far too highly esteemed. There\r\nhas been, especially in America, a great moral awakening, which we may\r\nexpect to have good results among all classes. As regards the working\r\nclasses, we have seen how long and hard in most countries has been their\r\ndiscipline of privation and sorrow. The representatives of labour have\r\nfor generations undergone a stern and severe training in prison and\r\nexile. In Russia to-day they have been suffering and inflicting horrors\r\nwhich have been far worse.\r\n\r\nBut as we have repeatedly had occasion to point out in this book, their\r\ntraining in constructive work, in political organisation, in trade\r\nunions, and co-operative societies has been vastly more efficacious.\r\nMost promising of all; as we have seen, is the co-operative movement,\r\nbecause it best combines the collective use of the means of production\r\nand exchange with individual freedom and responsibility. In the vast and\r\never-widening co-operative movement we can see a new society rising in\r\nthe midst of the old. Every year it widens and grows, and we hope it\r\nwill grow and widen till the old, with all its false and base ideals,\r\nits unreason, its militarism, its mismanagement, waste, and extravagance\r\nhas been put away. Hearts have been burning with the sacred fire of\r\nnoble ideals in the promoting of this grand work. Imaginations have been\r\nhaunted with beautiful dreams, which have not been vain. But we should\r\nprize not less the patient and persevering integrity which, through a\r\nmultitude of petty and prosaic details, is bearing the movement onward\r\nto an ever higher position in the world. At Ghent and other places we\r\nmay already see both in spirit and material outline the city that is to\r\nbe, the new society that is rising to make life happy and beautiful for\r\nthe people who have mourned so long! In the application of the\r\nco-operative principle to agriculture we can at last see an ending to\r\nthe oppression of the tiller of the soil by the usurer and middleman,\r\nwhich has been a stain on civilisation since it began thousands of years\r\nago in the valleys of the Euphrates and the Nile.\r\n\r\nThe day is coming, perhaps it may be near at hand, when we shall be able\r\nto discover and to apply the true tests of greatness. When, with their\r\nhelp, we are able to write history in a really scientific manner, we\r\nshall find that the Napoleons and the others, the records of whose\r\ndoings now fill our libraries, were not great at all, but the reverse of\r\nit, and that the true heroes and benefactors of the nineteenth century\r\nwere the poor weavers of Rochdale and Ghent, who started and carried\r\nforward the co-operative movement. All honour to them for what they have\r\ndone!\r\n\r\nAnd yet all that they have done is only the solid and hopeful beginning\r\nof the realisation of our dreams. For the ideal is superb and exacting.\r\nMen are slow to move towards it. They find it hard even to understand\r\nand appreciate its beauty and excellence. Let us fervently hope that\r\nafter the way towards a good and beautiful life for humanity has been so\r\nclearly pointed out, an ever-increasing multitude may have the wisdom to\r\nwalk in it.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the transition to a reasonable socialism will be marked\r\nby a long and testing process of social selection. From the beginning of\r\nthe movement socialist theories have been subjected to the tests of\r\ndiscussion and of experience. Socialist parties have also undergone very\r\nsevere trial in debate, organisation, and action. Trade unions and\r\nlabour parties have been obliged to go through a very hard course of\r\ndiscipline and of suffering.\r\n\r\nIt should be particularly observed that these tests more and more belong\r\nto the domain of intelligence, of moral character, and of skilled\r\norganisation. Success in the struggle for existence depends on fitness\r\nor adaptation to surrounding conditions. In the lower stages of the\r\nstruggle for existence, as we saw in Chap. XII., the conditions were of\r\na lower order. In the ascending struggle for a higher existence the\r\nconditions are higher and offer a severer and more exacting test. Labour\r\nwhich aspires to a higher life must stand those higher tests. Socialist\r\nprogrammes and resolutions are therefore perfectly right in dwelling on\r\nthe urgent need for agitation, education, and organisation as a means of\r\ntraining the working class for its great duties and its high career. And\r\nwe may repeat that the most urgent need of all is the capacity, moral\r\nand intellectual, for association.\r\n\r\nThus the transition to socialism can be made only by increasing and\r\nwidening adaptation to the higher conditions of intelligence, character,\r\nand organisation. Once made, the change to socialism will place men in a\r\nhigher moral and economic environment. As we saw, two vital human\r\ninterests will under socialism be no longer subject to the conditions of\r\ncompetition, the working day and the ‘daily bread.’ Every able man will\r\nbe under obligation to perform reasonable service for a competent\r\nlivelihood; but beyond this his time and faculties will be his own. In\r\nthis better environment men will find the rights and the opportunities\r\nwhich will give them the basis and scope for a better life. There will\r\nbe corresponding duties and obligations. And for those who, from vices\r\nand defects of temperament or of habit, are not disposed to fulfil such\r\nobligations suitable measures of social discipline will need to be\r\ndevised. The weak and disabled will receive suitable guidance and\r\nsupport. But we may be assured that all normally constituted men will be\r\nready to respond to all natural and reasonable calls.\r\n\r\nSocial service will be the main field for emulation, rivalry, and\r\nambition, and here the struggle for a higher life may be carried on\r\nunder the better conditions which will prevail. We may call it\r\ncompetition if we will, but it will be competition on terms that differ\r\nentirely from those which exist under the present system. It will be\r\ncompetition for social distinction and rewards. The reticence, secrecy,\r\nand hypocrisy, the jealousy and detraction, which are now so common will\r\npass away. Men will be able to live sincerely and openly. Their record\r\nwill be an open and public one, which their fellow-citizens will be able\r\nto read and estimate fairly. And we should avoid the grave mistake of\r\nconfounding the human qualities that make for success in the present\r\ncompetition with the qualities that would meet with approval under the\r\nnew system. The qualities that command success at present we all know.\r\nThe qualities that would meet with favour under a reasonable socialism\r\nwill be those which answer to the great ideals we have spoken of, and\r\nparticularly those which fit men for the best social service.\r\n\r\nThe waste and demoralisation, the injustice and cruelty, which are so\r\nrife under the present system will pass away. But the new era will work\r\nfor much more than the mere abolition of evil. It will make for the\r\npositive and integral development of the highest human life. Natural\r\ncapacity in all the forms that are consistent with social good will have\r\nfree scope for unfolding itself. We may believe that in the majority of\r\nlives the exercise of natural endowment will be in direct conformity\r\nwith the requirements of social service. It will obviously be for the\r\ngood of society that each will do the work for which he is best fitted.\r\nSpiritual teaching, scientific discovery, literature, art, and music\r\nwill all be duly prized and rewarded as modes of social service. But if\r\nthe aspirant wishes to do his share of social work in the form of some\r\nordinary craft, in order to devote his ample leisure to a special\r\npursuit entirely of his own choosing, he will be free to do so. In this\r\nmatter freedom will be an interest of the first order.\r\n\r\nThe lesson taught by much recent experience and the goal of many\r\nconvergent tendencies seem undoubtedly to be, that society should\r\ncontrol industry in its own interest. An industry carried on by free\r\nassociated men would be in perfect accord with other forms and methods\r\nof progress, ethical, political, and economic. The purified socialism\r\nmay be regarded as the co-ordination and consummation of every other\r\nform of human progress, inasmuch as it applies to the use of man all the\r\nfactors of scientific, mechanical, and artistic development in harmony\r\nwith the prevailing political and ethical ideas.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore a most desirable form of organisation. And many large\r\nand growing symptoms show that it is practicable. It is a type of\r\norganisation which may take shape in a thousand diverse ways, according\r\nto the differences in historic conditions and in national temperament.\r\nWithin its limits, as we have seen, there will be reasonable scope for\r\nindividual development and for every variety of liking and capacity\r\nconsistent with the well-being of others; but exceptional talent and the\r\ngenerous enthusiasm which is its fitting accompaniment will more and\r\nmore find their proper field in the service of society, an ideal which\r\nis already largely realised in the democratic state.\r\n\r\nIn a rational socialism we may therefore see a long and widening avenue\r\nof progress, along which the improvement of mankind may be continued in\r\na peaceful and gradual, yet most hopeful, sure, and effective way. Such\r\na prospect offers the best remedy for the apathy and frivolity, cynicism\r\nand pessimism, which are now so prevalent; and it is the most effectual\r\ncounteractive to restlessness, discontent, and all the evils and\r\nexcesses of the revolutionary spirit. Under it the social forces will\r\nconsciously and directly work for social ideals. The ideal will be made\r\nreal, and might and right will be reconciled. The real forces which\r\noperate in modern history will be shaped by beneficent ideals, till, as\r\nTennyson sings,\r\n\r\n    Each man find his own in all men’s good,\r\n    And all men work in noble brotherhood.\r\n\r\nMay we not with Saint-Simon hope that the golden age is not behind but\r\nbefore us?\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[1] _Inquiry into Socialism_, 3rd edition, p. 133.\r\n\r\n[2] See pp. 287, 288.\r\n\r\n[3] See p. 148.\r\n\r\n[4] _Kapital_, p. 790.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                APPENDIX\r\n\r\nAfter the Revolution of 1830 the Saint-Simonists were referred to in the\r\nFrench Chamber of Deputies as a sect who advocated community of goods\r\nand of women. The following communication in their defence was addressed\r\nto the Chamber by Bazard and Enfantin, October 1, 1830:—\r\n\r\n‘The Saint-Simonists undoubtedly do profess ideas on the future of\r\nproperty and of women which are special to themselves, and which are\r\nconnected with views entirely new and special on religion, authority,\r\nliberty—in short, on all the great problems which are now being\r\nagitated over the whole of Europe with so much disorder and violence;\r\nbut these ideas are very different from the opinions which men attribute\r\nto them.\r\n\r\n‘The system of community of goods is always understood to mean equal\r\ndivision among all the members of society, either of the means of\r\nproduction or of the fruit of the labour of all.\r\n\r\n‘The Saint-Simonists reject this equal division of property, which in\r\ntheir eyes would constitute a greater violence, a more revolting\r\ninjustice, than the unequal division, which was originally effected by\r\nforce of arms, by conquest.\r\n\r\n‘For they believe in the natural inequality of men, and regard this\r\ninequality as the very basis of association, as the indispensable\r\ncondition of social order.\r\n\r\n‘They reject the system of community of goods, for this would be a\r\nmanifest violation of the first of all the moral laws, which it is their\r\nmission to teach, and which enjoins that in the future each man should\r\nbe placed according to his capacity, and rewarded according to his work.\r\n\r\n‘But in virtue of this law they demand the abolition of all the\r\nprivileges of birth without exception, and consequently the destruction\r\nof the right of inheritance, the greatest of those privileges, which at\r\npresent comprehends them all, and of which the effect is to leave to\r\nchance the distribution of social privileges amongst the small number of\r\nthose who can lay claim to them, and to condemn the most numerous class\r\nto depravation, ignorance, and misery.\r\n\r\n‘They demand that all the instruments of labour, land, and capital,\r\nwhich at present form the divided stock of private proprietors, should\r\nbe exploited by associations with a suitable gradation of functions, so\r\nthat the task of each may be the expression of his capacity, and his\r\nriches the measure of his services.\r\n\r\n‘The Saint-Simonists do not attack the institution of private property,\r\nexcept in so far as it consecrates for some the impious privilege of\r\nidleness—that is to say, of living on the labour of others; except as\r\nit leaves to the accident of birth the social status of individuals.\r\n\r\n‘Christianity has delivered women from slavery, but it has nevertheless\r\ncondemned them to an inferior position, and in Christian Europe we still\r\nsee them everywhere deprived of religious, political, and civil rights.\r\n\r\n‘The Saint-Simonists announce their final liberation, their complete\r\nemancipation, but they do not aim at abolishing the sacred law of\r\nmarriage proclaimed by Christianity; on the contrary, they desire to\r\nfulfil this law, to give it a new sanction, to add to the authority and\r\ninviolability of the union which it consecrates.\r\n\r\n‘Like Christians they demand that a single man be united to a single\r\nwoman; but they teach that the wife should become the equal of the\r\nhusband, and that, according to the special grace with which God has\r\nendowed her sex, she should be associated in the exercise of the triple\r\nfunction of religion, the State, and the family, so that the social\r\nindividual, which hitherto has been the man only, may henceforward be\r\nman and woman.\r\n\r\n‘The religion of Saint-Simon seeks only to abolish the shameful traffic,\r\nthe legal prostitution, which, under the name of marriage, at present so\r\nfrequently consecrates the unnatural union of self-sacrifice and\r\negotism, of intelligence and ignorance, of youth and decrepitude.\r\n\r\n‘Such are the most general ideas of the Saint-Simonists on the changes\r\nwhich they demand in the arrangements of property and in the social\r\ncondition of women.’\r\n\r\n      PROGRAMME OF THE SOCIALISTIC WORKING MEN’S PARTY OF GERMANY\r\n\r\n                                                    Gotha, _May_ 1875.\r\n\r\nI. Labour is the source of all wealth and all culture, and as useful\r\nwork in general is possible only through society, so to society, that is\r\nto all its members, the entire product belongs; while as the obligation\r\nto labour is universal, all have an equal right to such product, each\r\none according to his reasonable needs.\r\n\r\nIn the existing society the instruments of labour are a monopoly of the\r\ncapitalist class; the subjection of the working class thus arising is\r\nthe cause of misery and servitude in every form.\r\n\r\nThe emancipation of the working class demands the transformation of the\r\ninstruments of labour into the common property of society and the\r\nco-operative control of the total labour, with application of the\r\nproduct of labour to the common good and just distribution of the same.\r\n\r\nThe emancipation of labour must be the work of the labouring class, in\r\ncontrast to which all other classes are only a reactionary mass.\r\n\r\nII. Proceeding from these principles, the socialistic working men’s\r\nparty of Germany aims by all legal means at the establishment of the\r\nfree state and the socialistic society, to destroy the Iron Law of Wages\r\nby abolishing the system of wage-labour, to put an end to exploitation\r\nin every form, to remove all social and political inequality.\r\n\r\nThe socialistic working men’s party of Germany, though acting first of\r\nall within the national limits, is conscious of the international\r\ncharacter of the labour movement, and resolved to fulfil all the duties\r\nwhich this imposes on the workmen, in order to realise the universal\r\nbrotherhood of men.\r\n\r\n                 *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nIn order to prepare the way for the solution of the social question, the\r\nsocialistic working men’s party of Germany demands the establishment of\r\nsocialistic productive associations with State help under the democratic\r\ncontrol of the labouring people. The productive associations are to be\r\nfounded on such a scale both for industry and agriculture that out of\r\nthem may develop the socialistic organisation of the total labour.\r\n\r\nThe socialistic working men’s party of Germany demands as the basis of\r\nthe State:—\r\n\r\nI. Universal, equal, and direct right of electing and voting, with\r\nsecret and obligatory voting, of all citizens from twenty years of age,\r\nfor all elections and deliberations in the State and local bodies. The\r\nday of election or voting must be a Sunday or holiday.\r\n\r\nII. Direct legislation by the people. Questions of war and peace to be\r\ndecided by the people.\r\n\r\nIII. Universal military duty. A people’s army in place of the standing\r\narmies.\r\n\r\nIV. Abolition of all exceptional laws, especially as regards the press,\r\nunions, and meetings, and generally of all laws which restrict freedom\r\nof thought and inquiry.\r\n\r\nV. Administration of justice by the people. Free justice.\r\n\r\nVI. Universal and equal education by the State. Compulsory education.\r\nFree education in all public places of instruction. Religion declared to\r\nbe a private concern.\r\n\r\nThe socialistic working men’s party demands within the existing society:\r\n\r\n(1) Greatest possible extension of political rights and liberties in the\r\nsense of the above demands.\r\n\r\n(2) A single progressive income-tax for State and commune, instead of\r\nthe existing taxes, and especially of the indirect taxes that oppress\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n(3) Unrestricted right of combination.\r\n\r\n(4) A normal working-day corresponding to the needs of society.\r\nProhibition of Sunday labour.\r\n\r\n(5) Prohibition of labour of children, and of all women’s labour that is\r\ninjurious to health and morality.\r\n\r\n(6) Laws for the protection of the life and health of workmen. Sanitary\r\ncontrol of workmen’s dwellings. Inspection of mines, of factories,\r\nworkshops, and home industries by officials chosen by the workmen. An\r\neffective Employers’ Liability Act.\r\n\r\n(7) Regulation of prison labour.\r\n\r\n(8) Workmen’s funds to be under the entire control of the workmen.\r\n\r\n          PROGRAMME OF THE KNIGHTS OF LABOUR OF AMERICA, 1885\r\n\r\nI. To make industrial and moral worth, not wealth, the true standard of\r\nindividual and national greatness.\r\n\r\nII. To secure to the workers the full enjoyment of the wealth they\r\ncreate; sufficient leisure in which to develop their intellectual,\r\nmoral, and social faculties; all the benefits, recreation, and pleasures\r\nof association; in a word, to enable them to share in the gains and\r\nhonours of advancing civilisation.\r\n\r\nIn order to secure these results, we demand of the State:\r\n\r\nIII. The establishment of Bureaus of Labour Statistics, that we may\r\narrive at a correct knowledge of the educational, moral, and financial\r\ncondition of the labouring masses.\r\n\r\nIV. That the public lands, the heritage of the people, be reserved for\r\nactual settlers; not another acre for railroads or speculators: and that\r\nall lands now held for speculative purposes be taxed to their full\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nV. The abrogation of all laws that do not bear equally upon capital and\r\nlabour, and the removal of unjust technicalities, delays, and\r\ndiscriminations in the administration of justice.\r\n\r\nVI. The adoption of measures providing for the health and safety of\r\nthose engaged in mining, manufacturing, and building industries; and for\r\nindemnification to those engaged therein for injuries received through\r\nlack of necessary safeguards.\r\n\r\nVII. The recognition by incorporation of trades-unions, orders, and such\r\nother associations as may be organised by the working masses to improve\r\ntheir condition and protect their rights.\r\n\r\nVIII. The enactment of laws to compel corporations to pay their\r\nemployees weekly, in lawful money, for the labour of the preceding week,\r\nand giving mechanics and labourers a first lien upon the product of\r\ntheir labour to the extent of their full wages.\r\n\r\nIX. The abolition of the contract system on national, State, and\r\nmunicipal works.\r\n\r\nX. The enactment of laws providing for arbitration between employers and\r\nemployed, and to enforce the decision of the arbitrators.\r\n\r\nXI. The prohibition by law of the employment of children under fifteen\r\nyears of age in workshops, mines, and factories.\r\n\r\nXII. To prohibit the hiring out of convict labour.\r\n\r\nXIII. That a graduated income-tax be levied.\r\n\r\nAnd we demand at the hands of the Congress:\r\n\r\nXIV. The establishment of a national monetary system, in which a\r\ncirculating medium in necessary quantity shall issue direct to the\r\npeople, without the intervention of banks; that all the national issue\r\nshall be full legal tender in payment of all debts, public and private;\r\nand that the Government shall not guarantee or recognise any private\r\nbanks, or create any banking corporations.\r\n\r\nXV. That interest-bearing bonds, bills of credit or notes shall never be\r\nissued by the Government, but that, when need arises, the emergency\r\nshall be met by issue of legal tender, non-interest-bearing money.\r\n\r\nXVI. That the importation of foreign labour under contract be\r\nprohibited.\r\n\r\nXVII. That in connection with the post-office, the Government shall\r\norganise financial exchanges, safe deposits and facilities for deposit\r\nof the savings of the people in small sums.\r\n\r\nXVIII. That the Government shall obtain possession, by purchase, under\r\nthe rights of eminent domain, of all telegraphs, telephones, and\r\nrailroads, and that hereafter no charter or licence be issued to any\r\ncorporation for construction or operation of any means of transporting\r\nintelligence, passengers or freight.\r\n\r\nAnd while making the foregoing demands upon the State and National\r\nGovernment, we will endeavour to associate our own labours:\r\n\r\nXIX. To establish co-operative institutions such as will tend to\r\nsupersede the wage system, by the introduction of a co-operative\r\nindustrial system.\r\n\r\nXX. To secure for both sexes equal pay for equal work.\r\n\r\nXXI. To shorten the hours of labour by a general refusal to work for\r\nmore than eight hours.\r\n\r\nXXII. To persuade employers to agree to arbitrate all differences which\r\nmay arise between them and their employees, in order that the bonds of\r\nsympathy between them may be strengthened and that strikes may be\r\nrendered unnecessary.\r\n\r\n                      BASIS OF THE FABIAN SOCIETY\r\n\r\nThe Fabian Society consists of socialists.\r\n\r\nIt therefore aims at the reorganisation of society by the emancipation\r\nof Land and Industrial Capital from individual and class ownership, and\r\nthe vesting of them in the community for the general benefit. In this\r\nway only can the natural and acquired advantages of the country be\r\nequitably shared by the whole people.\r\n\r\nThe Society accordingly works for the extinction of private property in\r\nland and of the consequent individual appropriation, in the form of rent\r\nof the price paid for permission to use the earth, as well as for the\r\nadvantages of superior soils and sites.\r\n\r\nThe Society, further, works for the transfer to the community of the\r\nadministration of such industrial capital as can conveniently be managed\r\nsocially. For, owing to the monopoly of the means of production in the\r\npast, industrial inventions and the transformation of surplus income\r\ninto capital have mainly enriched the proprietary class, the worker\r\nbeing now dependent on that class for leave to earn a living.\r\n\r\nIf these measures be carried out, without compensation (though not\r\nwithout such relief to expropriated individuals as may seem fit to the\r\ncommunity), rent and interest will be added to the reward of labour, the\r\nidle class now living on the labour of others will necessarily\r\ndisappear, and practical equality of opportunity will be maintained by\r\nthe spontaneous action of economic forces with much less interference\r\nwith personal liberty than the present system entails.\r\n\r\nFor the attainment of these ends the Fabian Society looks to the spread\r\nof socialist opinions, and the social and political changes consequent\r\nthereon, including the establishment of equal citizenship for men and\r\nwomen. It seeks to promote these by the general dissemination of\r\nknowledge as to the relation between the individual and society in its\r\neconomic, ethical, and political aspects.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Fabian Society takes, at present, the following forms:—\r\n\r\n(1) Meetings for the discussion of questions connected with socialism.\r\n\r\n(2) The further investigation of economic problems, and the collection\r\nof facts contributing to their elucidation.\r\n\r\n(3) The issue of publications containing information on social\r\nquestions, and arguments relating to socialism.\r\n\r\n(4) The promotion of socialist lectures and debates in other societies\r\nand clubs.\r\n\r\n(5) The representation of the Society in public conferences and\r\ndiscussions on social questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n\r\nAlexander II., great hopes at his accession, 256;\r\n  rise of the revolutionary party during his reign, 257;\r\n  assassination, 265.\r\nAlexander III., and the revolutionary party, 270, 325.\r\nAllen, W., 62.\r\nAltruism, 11.\r\nAmerica, no class divisions till the middle of the nineteenth century,\r\n  334; great transformation in industrial conditions, 335;\r\n  organised capital confronted with organised labour, 335-336;\r\n  the plutocracy and Rockefeller, 371;\r\n  problem before the American people, 372, etc.\r\nAnarchism, first taught by Proudhon, 56;\r\n  the Marx school and the anarchist, 151;\r\n  its relation to the International, 190-192;\r\n  Michael Bakunin, its great apostle, 237;\r\n  set forth by Bakunin, 240, etc.;\r\n  and at the trial at Lyons, 243-245;\r\n  summed up and criticised, 246;\r\n  a leading form of socialism in Russia, 257-272;\r\n  France, Italy, 243, 324;\r\n  in Spain, 324.\r\nAnarchy, socialism wrongly identified with, 7.\r\nArt as related to socialism, 11.\r\nAssociation of all classes of all nations founded by Owen, 3.\r\nAssociation, productive, with State help, 108, 110, 119.\r\nAustralia, Labour Party in, 334;\r\n  its power limited by circumstances, 393-394.\r\nAustria, 325, 377-378.\r\n\r\nBabeuf, his communism, 18.\r\nBakunin, Michael, at Paris, 42;\r\n  activity in the International, 190, 191;\r\n  his life, 237;\r\n  opinions, 240;\r\n  his influence in Russia, 260.\r\nBax, Belfort, 329.\r\nBazard, 26.\r\nBebel, 208, 212, 218, 315, etc., 380.\r\nBelgium, 319.\r\nBentham, Jeremy, 62.\r\nBernstein, 220, 314.\r\nBismarck, his work in German history, 79;\r\n  his historic insight, 94;\r\n  his relation to the German Social Democracy, 216, etc.;\r\n  his State socialism, 347.\r\nBlanc, Louis, his method of remuneration, 9;\r\n  his activity during the Revolution of 1848, 42;\r\n  life and theories, 43;\r\n  points of agreement with Lassalle, 273, 274.\r\n_Bourgeoisie_, the middle or capitalist class, 41, 98, 139, etc., 172,\r\n  etc.;\r\n  its position in Russia, 255, 266;\r\n  a theory of Marx, 411.\r\n\r\nCapital, aim of socialism with regard to it, 8, 9, 10, etc.;\r\n  contrast between labour and capital, 25;\r\n  individual capital, an institution in Fourier’s system, 38, 40;\r\n  how regarded by L.
