Under many circumstances, I could believe\r\nin the wisdom of so doing; but if it can be shown that there are great\r\nobjections against the present practice, then I think that, for the sake\r\nof the principle, we ought to be prepared to receive with gratitude such\r\na change as may remove well-grounded and reasonable objections.  The\r\nprinciple and the practice are so intimately connected in people’s minds\r\nthat they are almost sure to stand and fall together; so that if there is\r\nany great defect in the practice, there is danger of the principle being\r\nmade to bear the blame of it; and if the practice is such as to give\r\nreasonable dissatisfaction to reasonable men, it is almost sure to weaken\r\nthe hold which the principle has on the public mind.  On these grounds I\r\nam anxious to call the attention of those Churchmen who believe in the\r\nimportance of the principle of Subscription to the practice as at present\r\nimposed by the Act of Uniformity on the beneficed clergymen of the Church\r\nof England; and I do so under the very strong conviction that, in order\r\nto maintain the principle and, I might almost add, on every other ground,\r\nthere should be an united endeavour amongst English Churchmen without\r\ndelay to effect a change.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nMy reasons are as follows:—\r\n\r\n(1.)  The Subscription, as now required of all incumbents, is required\r\nnot by the Church, but by the State.  The Church of England is in no\r\nsense responsible for it, having never either sought or sanctioned it.\r\nAs the Church of England has always held the principle of Subscription,\r\nso it has provided a form.  This form was first prepared in Convocation,\r\nand then sanctioned by James I., by virtue of his prerogative royal, and\r\nsupreme authority in causes ecclesiastical.\r\n\r\nThis is the form embodied in the thirty-sixth Canon, and is as follows:—\r\n\r\nI.  That the King’s Majesty, under God, is the only supreme Governor of\r\nthis Realm, and of all other his Highnesses dominions and countries, as\r\nwell in all spiritual or ecclesiastical things or causes as temporal; and\r\nthat no foreign prince, person, prelate, state, or potentate hath, or\r\nought to have, any jurisdiction, power, superiority, pre-eminence, or\r\nauthority, ecclesiastical or spiritual, within his Majesty’s said realms,\r\ndominions, and countries.\r\n\r\nII.  That the Book of Common Prayer, and of ordering of bishops, priests,\r\nand deacons, containeth in it nothing contrary to the Word of God, and\r\nthat it may lawfully so be used; and that he himself will use the form in\r\nthe said book prescribed, in publick prayer, and administration of the\r\nSacraments, and none other.\r\n\r\nIII.  That he alloweth the Book of Articles of Religion, agreed upon by\r\nthe archbishops and bishops of both provinces, and the whole clergy in\r\nthe Convocation, holden at London, in the year of our Lord 1562; and that\r\nhe acknowledgeth all and every the articles therein contained, being in\r\nnumber nine-and-thirty, besides the ratification, to be agreeable to the\r\nWord of God.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nBut the Church’s form was too temperate for the vindictive spirit of\r\nCharles II. and his Parliament; and therefore, without consulting the\r\nChurch at all, the King’s Majesty, with the consent of the Lords and\r\nCommons, enacted a new form of Subscription, and imposed it on all those\r\nwho either held any benefice at the time, or should hereafter be\r\npresented to one.  No one, therefore, need fear that his allegiance to\r\nthe Church would be in any manner compromised by his disapprobation of\r\nthe form of Subscription required by the Act of Uniformity; for the\r\nChurch has never had anything to do with it beyond bearing the blame.  It\r\nis a test imposed on Churchmen by Act of Parliament, without the\r\nconcurrence of the Church itself, and virtually supersedes the form which\r\nthe Church has provided.  It appears to me, therefore, that loyalty to\r\nour Church would lead us respectfully to petition for the repeal of the\r\nParliamentary enactment, that so our Church may be permitted to carry out\r\nher own principles, and make use of the form deliberately drawn up by\r\nConvocation, and sanctioned by the Crown.##\r\n\r\n(2.)  It is impossible to prove a negative; and I may be mistaken: but I\r\nam not able to discover that such a form of Subscription as that required\r\nby the Act of Uniformity was ever known in the whole history of\r\nChristendom.  Churches, one after another, have drawn up Confessions of\r\nFaith, and employed them as tests of opinion in the admission of their\r\nministers.  Most Churches have prepared liturgical forms for devotional\r\npurposes, and required the use of these forms in public worship.  The\r\nConfession of Faith has been carefully drawn up for one object, and the\r\nLiturgy for another; the one to secure sound doctrine, and the other pure\r\ndevotional worship.  So the Church of England, in _its_ form of\r\nSubscription, has kept the distinction perfectly clear.  It requires the\r\nnew incumbent to subscribe “that he alloweth the Book of Articles to be\r\nagreeable to the Word of God,” thereby giving a positive acknowledgment\r\nof their truth.  But of the devotional book, the Book of Common Prayer,\r\nit requires him to sign,—“That it containeth in it nothing contrary to\r\nthe Word of God, and that it may lawfully so be used, and that he himself\r\nwill use the form in the said book prescribed, in publick prayer and\r\nadministration of the Sacraments, and none other.”  The Book of Articles\r\nis employed as a Confession of Faith, or test of opinion; whereas all\r\nthat is required respecting the Book of Common Prayer is the promise to\r\nuse it, with the declaration that there is nothing wrong in so doing.\r\nBut this temperate spirit of the Church was not sufficient for the\r\npurposes of Charles and his Parliament.  The persons whom they wanted to\r\nturn out believed in the Articles, and were, many of them, quite willing\r\nto use the Prayer-book.  Thus the Church’s principles were insufficient\r\nfor their ejection, and, in order to get rid of them, the plan was\r\ndevised of omitting all specific mention of the Articles, and making use\r\nof the whole book as the test or confession of faith.  A long devotional\r\nbook of 400 pages, containing prayers, Psalms as pointed for chanting,\r\nrubrics, addresses, and special services, some of which can be used by\r\nthe Bishops only, are all massed together, and made into a new exclusive\r\ncreed.  There is no exception made for anything.  “All and every thing”\r\nis alike included, and the language is made as stringent as possible.  It\r\nis as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “I, A. B., do hereby declare my unfeigned assent and consent to all\r\n    and every thing contained and prescribed in and by the book\r\n    intituled, The Book of Common Prayer, and Administration of the\r\n    Sacraments, and other Rites and Ceremonies of the Church, according\r\n    to the uses of the Church of England; together with the Psalter, or\r\n    Psalms of David, pointed as they are to be said or sung in Churches;\r\n    and the form or manner of making, ordaining, and consecrating of\r\n    Bishops, Priests, and Deacons.”\r\n\r\nNever, I believe, was a more flagrant misuse of any document.  The book\r\nwas prepared for one purpose, and then, for party ends, employed for\r\nanother.  Prayers were made into creeds; the pointing of the Psalms into\r\na test of opinion; and rubrics into confessions of faith.  Fortunately,\r\nthere is wonderfully little in the book, taken as a whole, to wound the\r\nconscience of those who subscribe to the Articles.  But that is not the\r\npoint.  The real question is, whether prayers, pointings, rubrics, &c.,\r\nshould be employed as creeds.  My own belief is, that they never ought to\r\nbe; for, if there is the accuracy of the creed, there cannot be the\r\ndevotional warmth of the prayer; that they never have been, except in\r\nthis instance; and that they would not have been, even in 1662, had it\r\nnot been for the spirit of retaliation, which, unhappily, induced the\r\nKing and Parliament to agree in passing the Act of Uniformity.\r\n\r\n(3.)  But as the form of Subscription is Wrong in principle, so to many\r\nconscientious minds it becomes painful in practice.\r\n\r\nIn a long devotional book it is next to impossible that all and\r\neverything should be exactly to the mind of any one, and of all the\r\nthousands of clergymen who regard the Liturgy as amongst the most sacred\r\npossessions ever given to a Church I believe there are very few who would\r\nnot rejoice over a slight change here and there, if only they could be\r\nsure that no changes which they disapproved would be introduced with\r\nthose they would approve.  Looking at the book in its comprehensive\r\ncharacter, as containing a Calendar of Lessons, a vast number of rubrics,\r\nthe Psalms pointed for chanting, and several occasional services, it is\r\nvain to expect that every point of detail shall be exactly to the mind of\r\nany man.  However decided the general approval, there must of necessity\r\nbe points of detail which grate, to say the least, on the feelings, if\r\nthey are not opposed to the judgment.  Thus there are many persons who\r\nbelieve that there is nothing contrary to God’s Word in the Prayer-book,\r\nand that it may be lawfully used, who still consider that “assent and\r\nconsent to all and every thing” is too strong a term to express their\r\nstate of mind respecting it.  The result is that some are deterred from\r\nentering the ministry, others decline or resign preferment; while many\r\nothers would consider it a great relief if the form in the Canon were\r\nsubstituted for that in the Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\n(4.)  But there is another objection of a much graver character, and one\r\nwhich, in these days of loose opinion, is, I believe, far more important\r\nthan any already mentioned.  By the confusion of the Articles and the\r\nritual in one form of Subscription the door is opened for great laxity as\r\nto doctrine.\r\n\r\nTo meet the difficulty which conscientious persons may feel with\r\nreference to the ritual, our Church, in the preface, claims for the book\r\nthat it shall “be allowed such just and favourable construction as in\r\ncommon equity ought to be allowed to all human writings, especially such\r\nas are set forth by authority.”  It is supposed, therefore, by the\r\nChurch, that each clergyman will put his own favourable construction on\r\nthe details of the book, which, as a whole, he greatly values; and,\r\nprovided that he does not consider any portion contrary to God’s Word,\r\nshe is prepared to entrust him with the use of it in the public ministry.\r\nNow, such a principle as this is all very well with reference to forms,\r\nbut becomes inexpressibly dangerous when applied to doctrines.  It is\r\nonly right that men should be allowed to entertain their own opinion\r\nrespecting the selection of lessons in the calendar; but the very life of\r\nthe Church is imperilled if we admit a similar latitude respecting the\r\nessential truths of Christianity.  Thus, the Act of Uniformity, by\r\nconfusing the two in one form of Subscription, practically opens the way\r\nfor laxity of religious belief.  It puts those who do not believe in the\r\nThirty-nine Articles in the same position as those who think that\r\nmistakes have been made in the calendar, or that the mind of the Church\r\nwould be better expressed if two or three sentences amongst the\r\noccasional services were omitted or slightly modified.  The favourable\r\nconstruction which is necessary for a comprehensive ritual is claimed\r\nequally for the confession of faith, and the denial of revealed truth is\r\nplaced on the same level as a scruple about a rubric.  To the mind of\r\nCharles and his advisers I am inclined to think that the two were of\r\nequal importance, or possibly the forms were more important than the\r\ndoctrines.  But men of all classes are now, thank God, waking up to the\r\nconviction that all matters of ritual are as nothing when compared with\r\nthe truth as revealed in Scripture; and it is lamentable to think that\r\nthose who deny such a doctrine as the Atonement should be no more\r\ncondemned by their Subscription than are those conscientious men who are\r\nmade uncomfortable by a few trifling matters in the ritual.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion, therefore, is that, just in proportion as we value Divine\r\ntruth, we should endeavour to fall back on the wisdom of our forefathers,\r\nwho kept the two things quite distinct; and that there ought to be two\r\nforms of Subscription, as directed by the Canon, instead of one, as\r\nrequired by the Act of Uniformity; that so our adhesion to the great\r\nscriptural and essential truths of the Gospel may stand out, as the\r\nChurch has placed it, quite distinct from our approbation of the various\r\ndetails of the ritual.\r\n\r\nBut it is frequently argued that, if we touch any portion of the Act of\r\nUniformity, the whole would be endangered; and it is regarded as so\r\nsacred a bulwark around the truth that no risk must be incurred\r\nrespecting it.\r\n\r\nNow, I believe that this respect for the Act of Uniformity arises simply\r\nfrom the fact that no one reads it.  The greater part has long since\r\nbecome a dead-letter, and if the whole were swept away our position would\r\nbe very slightly changed.  The following is a short summary:—\r\n\r\n1.  That the Book of Common Prayer as revised in 1660 should be used\r\ninstead of that of Edward VI.\r\n\r\n2.  That all parsons, vicars, or other ministers should subscribe,\r\naccording to the form above given, before the Feast of St. Bartholomew,\r\n1662; or within one month be deprived, _ipso facto_, of their spiritual\r\npromotions.\r\n\r\n3.  That every person who may hereafter be presented to any living make\r\nthe same Subscription.\r\n\r\n4.  That every resident incumbent, where a curate is kept, read the\r\ncommon prayers and service at least once a month, or forfeit 5_l._ to the\r\npoor of the parish, on conviction before two justices of the peace.\r\n\r\n5.  That all deans, canons, &c., and even tutors in private families,\r\nshall subscribe a declaration against rebellion, a promise to conform to\r\nthe Liturgy, and until the year 1682 a renunciation of the Solemn League\r\nand Covenant.\r\n\r\n6.  That no person shall act as schoolmaster or private tutor in any\r\nfamily without a licence from the Bishop, and that any person teaching\r\nwithout a licence shall be liable to imprisonment for three months and a\r\nfine of 5_l._\r\n\r\n7.  That no person shall be admitted to any benefice who is not in holy\r\norders by episcopal ordination; or administer the Sacrament of the Lord’s\r\nSupper unless he be ordained priest by episcopal ordination, upon pain of\r\na penalty of 100_l._\r\n\r\n8.  That the penalties in this Act shall not extend to foreigners or\r\naliens of the Foreign Reformed Churches allowed, or to be allowed, by the\r\nKing’s Majesty, his heirs and successors in England.\r\n\r\n9.  That all heads of colleges read the Morning Prayer in their college\r\nchapel at least once in every quarter, upon pain to lose and be suspended\r\nof and from all benefits and profits belonging to the same Government or\r\nHeadship by the space of six months.\r\n\r\n10.  That all lecturers or preachers shall, on their admission and on the\r\nfirst lecture day in every month afterwards, read the prayers for the\r\ntime of the day, and shall afterwards declare their unfeigned assent and\r\nconsent to the Book of Common Prayer according to the prescribed form;\r\nthat if they neglect to do so they shall be disabled to preach the said\r\nor any other lecture; and that if they preach when so disabled they shall\r\nsuffer three months’ imprisonment in the common gaol without bail or\r\nmain-prise.\r\n\r\n11.  That whenever a sermon or lecture is to be preached the common\r\nprayer and service for that time of the day must be read.\r\n\r\n12.  That previous statutes be not repealed.\r\n\r\n13.  That the parishioners of the several parishes procure copies of the\r\nPrayer-book before the Feast of St. Bartholomew, 1662.\r\n\r\n14.  That the Book be translated into Welsh.\r\n\r\n15.  That provision be made for the preservation of the Book in\r\nCathedrals and other places.\r\n\r\n16.  That the Thirty-sixth Article be understood as applying to the book\r\nmentioned in this Act as it did heretofore to that of Edward VI.\r\n\r\n17.  That the form of prayer heretofore in use shall remain so until the\r\nFeast of St. Bartholomew, 1662.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nNow what is there in all this that is worth preserving? and what barrier\r\ndoes it present against the inroads of error?  The greater part was\r\nintended only for the day, and had done its work before the close of the\r\nyear 1662.  Of the remainder there is very little which has not long\r\nsince fallen into abeyance.  Rectors are never fined 5_l._ if they fail\r\nin reading prayers once a month.  Tutors in private families never\r\nsubscribe any declaration against rebellion, and are never imprisoned for\r\nteaching without the licence of the Bishop.  Heads of Colleges are\r\nneither suspended nor deprived if they fail to read prayers once a\r\nquarter in their college chapels.  Lecturers never repeat their\r\ndeclaration of assent and consent on the first lecture day in each month,\r\nand yet are never imprisoned.  And the Litany is constantly used even by\r\nour Bishops in the place of Evening Prayer.  All that we want to preserve\r\nas of present and practical importance is the adoption of the Liturgy as\r\nrevised in 1660, and the necessity of Episcopal ordination.  For aught I\r\nknow these may be secured by other statutes; but if not, there would be\r\nno difficulty in securing them, though the whole Act of Uniformity were\r\nrepealed.  Or if it is thought desirable that so celebrated an Act of\r\nParliament ought to be preserved as a curious specimen of bygone\r\nvindictive legislation, let an amendment be introduced substituting the\r\nform of Subscription in the Canon for that required by the Act.  If this\r\nwere done, the Church would be permitted to guard its ministry according\r\nto its own principles; many tender consciences would be relieved, and an\r\nimportant step would be taken towards the attainment of the great object\r\nof Her Majesty’s Commission, viz., the simplification of Clerical\r\nSubscription “consistently with due security for the declared agreement\r\nof the clergy with the doctrines of the Church, and conformity to its\r\nritual.”\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n              Macintosh, Printer, Great New-street, London.",
