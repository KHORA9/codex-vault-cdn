It is not the purpose of this volume to offer a\r\nmere textbook or a scholastic essay on historical events. It is not\r\nthe purpose merely to record those events which led to the destruction\r\nof the Roman republic, and with this end our work. The main purpose of\r\nthis book is to compare events as they transpired in the one republic\r\nand in the other.\r\n\r\nThe political history of the Roman republic is throughout its whole\r\ncourse a continuous contest between radicals and conservatives. The\r\nstriking resemblances between the basis of the political controversies\r\nof Ancient Rome and the modern political and economic problems render\r\nit almost impossible for any historian to approach the political\r\nhistory of Rome entirely free from prejudice. The bias of the\r\nhistorian, whether toward the liberal or the conservative side in\r\npolitics, is sure to affect to a greater or less degree the pictures\r\nwhich he paints of the events and actors in Roman history. To indicate\r\nto some extent these varying views, and to present to the reader some\r\nof the ideas of prominent writers on Roman history, a number of\r\nextracts from the works of other authors have been inserted, as\r\noccasion demanded, in this work. In the majority of cases such an\r\ninsertion should be understood as an attempt to present all sides of\r\nsome controverted historical question rather than as indicating the\r\napproval by the author of the views expressed therein.\r\n\r\nIn arranging the perspective of this book, its main object has been\r\nkept constantly in mind. The importance of events has been weighed\r\nfrom the standpoint of their effect upon the decay and collapse of the\r\nfree political institutions of Rome; with the result that many\r\nsubjects, to which considerable space would be devoted in a general\r\nRoman history, have been passed over with a mere notice, while other\r\nevents, perhaps of less popular interest, have been treated at length.\r\n\r\nI would be false to the first sense of justice did I not here\r\nacknowledge the aid I have obtained from Professor Albert H. Putney,\r\ndean of the Webster College of Law, Chicago, and a lawyer of the state\r\nof Illinois at the city of Chicago (my home), who has been the\r\nprincipal contributor from whom I have received assistance, and much\r\nthat can be found in this book in the nature of real historical data,\r\nand of the philosophy of reasoning from this data, is due to him, and\r\nI desire to acknowledge my indebtedness and to give full credit for\r\nthe value of this work.\r\n\r\n  JAMES HAMILTON LEWIS\r\n\r\n  _United States Senate Chamber, Washington, D.

During these twenty\r\ncenturies many other republics have flourished and passed away, while,\r\nin turn, new republics have arisen to take the place of the earlier\r\nones; but no other fallen republic in the whole course of history has\r\nattained to the same degree of importance, has possessed the same\r\ndegree of interest, or has exerted the same influence on the history\r\nof the world, as did that of Rome. The five centuries of republican\r\ninstitutions on the banks of the Tiber still remain the richest\r\nquarry to which the student or historian of republican governments is\r\nable to resort for his material.\r\n\r\n\"History,\" says Lord Macaulay, \"is philosophy teaching by examples.\"\r\nThe most practical value of the study of history arises from the aid\r\nwhich it can give us in understanding the present and in forecasting\r\nthe future. Bolingbroke, on the \"Uses of History,\" commands its study\r\nas a protection against the unexpected. The main purpose of any\r\nAmerican, who to-day studies the history of the greatest republic of\r\nthe ancient world, should be to discover whether or not the story of\r\nthe rise and fall of that government teaches any lessons which might\r\nbe of value to the American of to-day; whether the evils which were\r\nthe causes of the overthrow of the Roman republic find any counterpart\r\nin the problems which agitate our own country.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest of American orators, in urging Americans to draw\r\ntheir historical lessons from the history of their own country, says\r\nthat \"when we go back into ancient history, we are bewildered by the\r\ndifferences of manners and institutions\"; but sometimes it is with\r\nthe earliest of nations that the most striking comparisons may be\r\nmade, and from their history that the greatest lessons may be learned.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that the progress of mankind, during that small fragment\r\nof the period of its existence upon this earth which we are permitted\r\nto see by the light of history, has been very uneven in the extent of\r\nits advances along the different lines of human progress. In the\r\nfields of scientific discovery and of material results human\r\nachievements, especially during the past century, have reached almost\r\ninto the realm of the marvelous; but in many other fields--those\r\nrelating to human reason, to knowledge of the human mind, to the\r\nrelation between man and man, and to the science of government--human\r\nprogress has been so slight that man's efforts in these directions\r\nmust still receive the verdict of failure.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this great discrepancy is perhaps not difficult to\r\ndiscover. It is easy for the mass of mankind to accept and receive the\r\nbenefits which come to them from the struggles and mental efforts of\r\nthe few intellectual giants whom the human race from time to time\r\nproduces; but all this takes place with very little change in the\r\nminds or emotions of the mass of humanity.\r\n\r\nAs, for example, the pages of Homer are studied, it is hard to say\r\nwhether the strongest impression left upon the mind of the reader is\r\nthat of the vast difference between the external life of that period\r\nand of the twentieth century, or that of the striking similarity\r\nbetween the qualities and emotions of the characters in these epics\r\nand of the men and women of to-day.\r\n\r\nIn the field of the material world any comparison between the existing\r\nconditions in the United States to-day and the conditions in any\r\nancient country could hardly be of any particular value; except,\r\nperhaps, to indicate the great distance which has been traveled. In\r\nthe field of government and politics, however, the most valuable\r\ncomparison which it is possible to make with existing conditions in\r\nthe United States is not with the present conditions in any modern\r\ncountry, nor is it with conditions of an earlier age in any\r\nAnglo-Saxon or even Teutonic country. The greatest resemblance to the\r\nexisting conditions in the United States, both as to the character of\r\nher politics and the nature of the problems which confront her, is to\r\nbe found in the great Roman republic of two thousand years ago.\r\n\r\nIn studying the decline and fall of the Roman republic it will appear\r\nthat this result was most directly brought about by the three\r\nfollowing causes:\r\n\r\n1. Long before the time when Rome had attained to the height of her\r\npower, great inequalities of wealth had arisen between the different\r\nstrata of the Roman citizens; the prosperity which came to Rome as a\r\nresult of her conquests was not distributed among her whole citizen\r\nbody. Indeed, while the wealth of the community as a whole was rapidly\r\nincreasing, the wealth of the great mass of the citizens was rapidly\r\ndecreasing, not only relatively but even absolutely. The acute stage\r\nof the contest between the rich and the poor arose immediately after\r\nthe conclusion of the long contest between patricians and plebeians,\r\nand at the time when, theoretically, all political distinctions and\r\nprivileges between citizens had disappeared. Yet, in fact, the\r\nsuffrage was then limited to the free citizen--the smallest class of\r\nthe humble or toiling numbers.\r\n\r\n2. The influence of a large and constantly increasing class of\r\ndemagogues, possessed of knowledge of human nature and endowed with\r\nskill in the management of men, yet entirely lacking in principle,\r\npatriotism, or any sense of public obligation. These wrought upon a\r\nmob of unqualified and reckless voters, who had nothing to lose and\r\nwere more anxious for immediate personal benefit than for the gradual\r\nbut permanent amelioration of the hardships of the class to which they\r\nbelonged.\r\n\r\n3. The absence of any system of representative organization in the\r\nRoman government.\r\n\r\nThe first two of these evils are to be found in the American republic\r\nof to-day as well as in the Roman republic of the past; the last of\r\nthe three was a disadvantage suffered by Rome but outgrown by the\r\nmodern republics. This last evil will be treated by itself in the\r\nsucceeding chapter, while the two former will be shown in the\r\nremainder of the volume as the political history of Rome is outlined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nROMAN LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLIES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn one important respect in the management of their political affairs,\r\nthe citizens of the Roman republic occupied a most disadvantageous\r\nposition in comparison with the citizens of any modern republic. The\r\ngreatest defect in the political organization of Rome, as of all other\r\nancient republics, lay in the utter absence of representative\r\nlegislative assemblies. The want of such institutions, in the absence\r\nof all the other causes of disruption, might of itself have been\r\nsufficient to have caused the downfall of the Roman republic.\r\n\r\nThe invention and development of such representative assemblies has\r\nbeen the greatest contribution which the Anglo-Saxon race has made to\r\nthe political progress of the world. It is largely the existence of\r\nsuch bodies which renders practical the continued existence of modern\r\nrepublics, with jurisdiction over extended areas.\r\n\r\nThe Roman legislative bodies were, throughout the whole period of\r\nRoman history, popular assemblies,--bodies of a character well\r\nadapted for the government of the community when Rome was a mere\r\ncity-republic on the Tiber, but entirely inadequate to meet existing\r\nconditions when the Roman territories had been extended far beyond the\r\nconfines of Latium and even beyond the shores of the Italian\r\npeninsula.\r\n\r\nThe system of Roman popular assemblies was so complicated, and these\r\nassemblies were so closely connected with every phase and every\r\nimportant epoch in Roman political history, that it seems advisable to\r\nstop at the outset and give a brief description of each of these\r\nassemblies; of the manner in which they were constituted; of their\r\norigin; and of the scope of their respective powers.\r\n\r\nThe oldest of these popular assemblies was the _comitia curiata_,\r\nwhich for a considerable period was the only body in Rome with the\r\npower to enact laws. This assembly was based upon the original\r\ndivision of the people into _gentes_ and _curiæ_, and was throughout\r\nits history a distinctively patrician body. The force of the contest\r\nfor a share in political power, waged by the plebeians, took in the\r\nmain the direction of stripping the comitia curiata of its power\r\ninstead of securing for the plebeians the right of membership in this\r\nassembly.\r\n\r\nAfter the creation of the _comitia centuriata_ the powers of the older\r\ncomitia rapidly declined, and were in the main limited to the control\r\nof certain portions of the state religion; particularly those\r\nreligious formalities connected with elections, legislation, or the\r\ninvesture of military leaders with the _imperium_. At a still later\r\ntime, the comitia curiata ceased to meet at all, and was merely\r\nconsidered as being represented by the lictors.\r\n\r\nThe two important assemblies of the people during the period of the\r\nhistory of the Roman republic were the comitia centuriata and the\r\n_comitia tributa_. The comitia centuriata came into existence during\r\nthe period which lies on the border line between mythology and\r\nhistory. In the legendary history of the Roman kingdom the creation of\r\nthis assembly is given as one of the reforms of Servius Tullius.\r\nHowever this may be, it was undoubtedly in existence (although not in\r\nthe exact form which it later acquired) as early as the sixth century\r\nbefore Christ. This assembly was reorganized some time before the\r\nPunic Wars. In its final form the tribal division was taken as the\r\nprimary division of the people; each tribe was divided into five\r\nclasses, according to the wealth of the citizens, and each class into\r\ntwo centuries, one century in each class consisting of _seniores_, or\r\nmen above forty-five years of age, and one consisting of _juniores_,\r\nor men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five. The ten centuries\r\nfrom each of the tribes made a total of three hundred fifty centuries,\r\nto whom were added eighteen centuries of knights, making a total of\r\nthree hundred sixty-eight centuries. Every question submitted to the\r\ncomitia centuriata was decided by the vote of a majority of centuries.\r\nAlthough all freemen had the right to vote in this assembly, the power\r\nof the richer classes was disproportionately great. This was secured\r\nby assigning to the five classes, into which each tribe was divided, a\r\nvery disproportionate number of citizens. The first class, to which\r\nonly the richest citizens were admitted, was very small in size, while\r\nthe fifth (and lowest) class was probably more numerous than the other\r\nfour classes combined.\r\n\r\nThe comitia centuriata was originally an assembly of the Roman\r\ncitizens in the form of an army, and the divisions into classes was\r\nbased upon the kind of equipment with which each soldier was able to\r\nprovide himself. The eighteen centuries of knights represented the\r\ncavalry of the army. These centuries of knights possessed the right of\r\nhaving their votes taken first, which constituted another advantage\r\nfor the wealthy classes. In 241 B.C. the knights were deprived of\r\ntheir right of voting first, but this privilege was given to the\r\ncenturies of the first rank, assigned by lot.\r\n\r\nThe comitia tributa, or assembly of the tribes, first met in 489 B.C.,\r\nit being convened by the Senate at that time to sit in judgment upon a\r\npatrician, Coriolanus, the responsibility for whose fate the Senate\r\ndesired to throw upon the plebeians. This assembly was originally a\r\nstrictly plebeian body, and its original authority was limited to the\r\nadministration of the business of the plebeian order. The class\r\ncharacter of the comitia tributa is indicated by its original\r\nname--_concilium tributum plebis_, the word _concilium_ indicating a\r\nconference of a certain part of the people rather than a legislative\r\nassembly of the whole people.\r\n\r\nIt would be hard to say whether it was the increased power of the\r\ntribunes which developed the authority of the comitia tributa, or\r\nwhether it was the increased power of the comitia tributa which first\r\ngave to the tribunes the vast power which they were ultimately able to\r\nexercise in Rome. However this may be, the fact is evident that the\r\npower of the comitia tributa and of the tribunes rose together. At a\r\nlater date, membership in the comitia tributa was not limited to the\r\nplebeians, but the influence of the patricians in this assembly was\r\nalways inconsiderable and they generally absented themselves from its\r\nmeetings. Although the wealthy classes had no predominating influence\r\nin the comitia tributa, its decision upon any question was far from\r\nbeing, necessarily, the decision of the majority. Measures submitted\r\nto the comitia tributa were carried or defeated by the vote of the\r\nmajority of the tribes, and the numbers enrolled in each tribe were\r\nvery unequal, all the inhabitants of the city of Rome being enrolled\r\ninto four tribes, and a very disproportionate power being thus given\r\nto the rural voters.\r\n\r\nThe meetings of the comitia tributa were generally presided over by a\r\ntribune, although sometimes by one of the consuls. At first the laws\r\npassed by the comitia tributa were required to be confirmed by a vote\r\nof the comitia centuriata, but this requirement was abolished in 339\r\nB.C. by the Publilian and Horatian laws. The provisions of these laws\r\nwere reaffirmed by the Hortensian laws in 286 B.C.; and it is certain\r\nthat at least from this date the full validity of a law passed by the\r\ncomitia tributa was never questioned.\r\n\r\nIn the comitia centuriata and the comitia tributa we see the anomalous\r\ncondition of two independent law-making assemblies; and as there was\r\nno division between them of the field of legislation, it is hard to\r\nsee how, even with the controlling influence of the Senate, conflicts\r\nbetween the two were so generally avoided. So completely were the two\r\ncomitiæ on an equality as to the validity of the laws enacted by each\r\nthat the records generally fail to show by which assembly any\r\nparticular law was passed, but this can generally be ascertained by\r\nlooking at the name of the proposer of the law. If a tribune appears\r\nas the proposer of the law it was passed by the comitia tributa; but\r\nif the proposer was a consul, prætor, or dictator, the law was the\r\nwork of the comitia centuriata.\r\n\r\nThe powers of the two comitiæ as to the election of officers were\r\ndifferentiated. The comitia centuriata, at all stages in the history\r\nof the Roman republic, possessed the right of electing the highest\r\nofficers of the republic--the consuls, prætors, and censors. The\r\ncomitia tributa originally possessed the right of electing only the\r\ntribunes and the plebeian ædiles; at a later period they elected also\r\nthe curule ædiles, the quæstors, the majority of the legionary\r\ntribunes, and all the inferior officers of state. The comitia tributa,\r\nin the later days of the republic, secured an indirect control over\r\nthe election of the higher officers also, since the adoption of the\r\nlegal principle that all Romans who sought the highest honors of the\r\nstate must pass through a regular gradation of offices rendered it\r\nnecessary for the comitia centuriata to choose as consuls and prætors\r\nmen who had previously been chosen by the comitia tributa as quæstors\r\nand ædiles. It must be remembered, however, that the law relative to\r\nthe order in which the various offices must be held was of a\r\ndirectory rather than a mandatory character; while in the main obeyed,\r\nit was, nevertheless, frequently violated.\r\n\r\nThe various public offices here referred to will be discussed in the\r\nlater chapters as each office first comes into existence in Roman\r\nhistory. It remains at this time to speak of the organization, powers,\r\nand authority of the Roman Senate, particularly as to its control over\r\nthe work of the popular assemblies.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the power of the Senate over legislation varied greatly\r\nin different periods of Roman history, and these differences were\r\ncaused more by the existing political conditions, and by the relative\r\nstrength of the aristocratic and popular parties in Rome, than by any\r\nexpress changes by legislation.\r\n\r\nAt the very outset of Roman history we see the Senate existing as an\r\naristocratic body, embodying in itself both the oligarchical\r\nprinciples upon which the Roman government was based, and also the\r\npatriarchal basis upon which the Roman family organization and later\r\nthe organization of the Roman state itself had been built.\r\n\r\nOriginally, each of the three Roman tribes was divided into ten\r\ngentes, each gens into ten curiæ, and each curia, besides constituting\r\none of the units in the comitia curiata, furnished one member of the\r\nRoman Senate. The Senate continued after the organization by curiæ had\r\nbecome obsolete. Membership in the Senate was at all periods for life,\r\nbut did not descend from father to son. Vacancies in the Senate were\r\nfilled by appointment, these appointments being made first by the\r\nkings, later by the consuls, and finally by the censors. As the\r\ncensors were chosen only once in five years, vacancies in the Senate\r\nwere filled only at such intervals. The aristocratic party in Rome, by\r\nkeeping control of the office of censor, was able to perpetuate their\r\nmajority in the Senate. In filling such vacancies, preference was\r\ngiven to those who had held some of the higher offices during the\r\npreceding five-year-period. Many members of the Senate had held the\r\noffice of consul; many more hoped to hold it in the future. All\r\nmembers of the Senate, with few exceptions, had held some civic\r\noffice, and were men of property and of mature age.\r\n\r\nAll the dignity of Rome and of the Roman government centered in the\r\nRoman Senate. The minister of Pyrrhus described this body as \"an\r\nassembly of kings,\" and it might well have aroused the surprise and\r\nadmiration of a foreign ambassador, as nowhere else in the world at\r\nthat time was it possible to find such an assembly, either from the\r\nstandpoint of the character of the body itself or of the\r\nqualifications of its members.\r\n\r\nAt an early period no law could be presented before the comitia\r\ncenturiata or the comitia tributa without having been previously\r\napproved by the Senate, and after the passage of the act, either by\r\nthe comitia centuriata or the comitia tributa, it must be promulgated\r\nby the Senate before it went into effect. The Senate, therefore, was\r\nnever possessed of a direct general power of legislation, but had in\r\nthe fullest degree both the power of initiating legislation and of\r\nvetoing it. At a later period the control of the Senate over\r\nlegislation became theoretically less, but practically greater.\r\n\r\nBy the Publilian Law (339 B.C.) the control of the Senate over the\r\ncomitia centuriata was reduced to a mere formality. By this time,\r\nhowever, the officers of the state, the tribunes as well as the\r\nconsuls, had fallen completely under the control of the Senate, while\r\nthe comitia tributa, in turn, fell more and more under the control of\r\nthe consuls and tribunes respectively. During the latter period of the\r\nrepublic the Senate practically legislated, and gave the bill to one\r\nof the tribunes (the tribunes were at this time far more completely\r\nunder the control of the Senate than were the consuls) to secure the\r\nmere formality of its passage by the comitia tributa.\r\n\r\nThe management of foreign affairs was at all times exclusively in the\r\nhands of the Senate, except that the question of declaring war or\r\nconcluding peace must be submitted to the vote of the people in one of\r\nthe popular assemblies. The Senate also regulated the religious\r\naffairs of the Roman state (after this power fell from the hands of\r\nthe comitia curiata); assigned consuls and prætors their provinces of\r\nadministration and command; fixed the amount of troops to be raised\r\nboth from the Roman citizens and from the Italian allies; sent and\r\nreceived ambassadors; controlled the calendar, adding to or taking\r\naway from a year so as to lengthen the term of a favorite official or\r\nto shorten the term of an unpopular one; decreed or refused triumphs\r\nto Roman generals, and possessed a general control over the financial\r\naffairs of the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST GREAT MELTING POT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe variety of things which are able to serve as a basis for human\r\nvanity are almost unlimited. This holds true as well in the case of\r\nnational vanity as in the case of the vanity of the individual. The\r\nmost backward and least attractive of human races generally consider\r\nthemselves superior to the rest of mankind, and too often on account\r\nof the peculiarities which, in the minds of others, are the most\r\nconvincing proofs of their inferiority. Even among the more advanced\r\nraces of mankind great pride is often manifested in attributes which,\r\nproperly viewed, are rather a disgrace, or at least a detriment to the\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nFew things in the world are held in greater respect, by the great\r\nmasses of men, than a long line of ancestry of unmixed blood. It seems\r\nto be generally felt that the purity of any race, that is, its freedom\r\nfrom interbreeding with outsiders, is a matter of credit. The lesson\r\nof history, however, shows that purity of blood in any nation is an\r\nevidence of, or perhaps rather cause of, degeneracy and decay, and\r\nthat the great nations of history have been the cosmopolitan races,\r\nthe races of mixed descent and hybrid ancestry. If it be thought that\r\nthe Jewish people are an exception to this, let it be recalled that\r\nthe Jews are a mixed people, originally of many conflicting tribes,\r\nand later continually mixed with other races.\r\n\r\nIn the pages of ancient history Rome stands out as the first great\r\ncosmopolitan race, or at least the first mixed race, in the creation\r\nof which we are able to watch the melting pot in full operation.\r\n\r\nThree thousand years ago the Italian peninsula presented a veritable\r\nmedley of races. In the south and along the eastern coast were found\r\nthe cities and colonies founded by the two streams of immigration from\r\nthe neighboring peninsula across the Adriatic--the Pelasgian and the\r\nGreek. In the center of Italy were to be found the various branches of\r\nthe Oscan, Umbrian, and Sabellian races. Farther to the north was the\r\ncountry of the Latins. Etruscans and Gauls dwelt between Latium and\r\nthe Alps. It was only at a much later time that Cisalpine Gaul began\r\nto be considered a part of Italy.\r\n\r\nIn its earliest days Rome, while possessing many features in common\r\nwith the other Italian cities, presented at the same time many\r\ndifferences.\r\n\r\n     \"The unfavorable character of the site renders it hard to\r\n     understand how the city could so early attain its prominent\r\n     position in Latium. The soil is unfavorable to the growth of\r\n     fig or vine, and in addition to the want of good\r\n     water-springs, swamps are caused by the frequent inundations\r\n     of the Tiber. Moreover, it was confined in all land\r\n     directions by powerful cities. But all these disadvantages\r\n     were more than compensated by the unfettered command it had\r\n     of both banks of the Tiber down to the mouth of the river.\r\n     The fact that the clan of the Romilii was settled on the\r\n     right bank from time immemorial, and that there lay the\r\n     grove of the creative goddess Dea Dia, and the primitive\r\n     seat of the Arval festival and Arval brotherhood, proves\r\n     that the original territory of Rome comprehended Janiculum\r\n     and Ostia, which afterwards fell into the hands of the\r\n     Etruscans. Not only did this position on both banks of the\r\n     Tiber place in Rome's hands all the traffic of Latium, but,\r\n     as the Tiber was the natural barrier against northern\r\n     invaders, Rome became the maritime frontier fortress of\r\n     Latium. Again, the situation acted in two ways: Firstly, it\r\n     brought Rome into commercial relations with the outer world,\r\n     cemented her alliance with Cære, and taught her the\r\n     importance of building bridges. Secondly, it caused the\r\n     Roman canton to become united in the city itself far earlier\r\n     than was the case with other Latin communities. And thus,\r\n     though Latium was a strictly agricultural country, Rome was\r\n     a center of commerce; and this commercial position stamped\r\n     its peculiar mark on the Roman character, distinguishing\r\n     them from the rest of the Latins and Italians, as the\r\n     citizen is distinguished from the rustic. Not, indeed, that\r\n     the Roman neglected his farm, or ceased to regard it as his\r\n     home; but the unwholesome air of the Campagna tended to make\r\n     him withdraw to the more healthful city hills; and from\r\n     early times by the side of the Roman farmer arose a\r\n     non-agricultural population, composed partly of foreigners\r\n     and partly of natives, which tended to develop urban life.\"\r\n     (Mommsen's _History of Rome_.)\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, as a cosmopolitan, commercial city that the Romans\r\nfirst came into prominence. The early population was composed of mixed\r\nEtruscan and Latin stock, to which representatives of every Italian\r\ntribe and of the Greeks were soon added. By the beginning of the truly\r\nhistorical times the Romans had become merged into one race,\r\nrepresenting the combined product of the races of Italy. It was this\r\nfact, very largely, which contributed to her success over the purer\r\n(ethnologically) races which surrounded her.\r\n\r\nThere were two great divisions of the melting-pot process at Rome; the\r\nfirst, that existing during the days of the kingdom and of the early\r\nrepublic; the second, that of the later republic and the empire.\r\nDuring the first period the process of intermixture, as has been said,\r\nwas between the different races of Italy; within the second period\r\nRome became the center of the civilized world, and her population\r\nincluded representatives of all the known races of mankind.\r\n\r\nIn no other despotism in the history of the world is there to be found\r\nso little racial or class distinction as in the Roman empire. Such\r\ndistinctions were never able to exist at Rome during any portion of\r\nher history. The permanent privileged classes were those possessed of\r\nwealth, or of military power, and the descendants of both the\r\nconquerors and the conquered of one epoch would be found in the next\r\nindiscriminately divided among the exploiters and the exploited of the\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThe patricians, the descendants of the early settlers of Rome, were\r\nunable to maintain their special caste privileges, and were compelled\r\nto admit the plebeians to equal political rights and privileges. Class\r\ndistinction remained in as marked a degree as ever at Rome, but the\r\ndistinction was now between rich and poor, and the rich plebeian took\r\nequal rank with the rich patrician. Nor were the united Roman orders\r\nstrong enough to preserve a monopoly of political privileges for\r\nRomans when the territory of Rome was extended over the Italian\r\npeninsula. It was found necessary to extend the franchise first to the\r\nresidents of Latium and later to those of the other portions of Italy.\r\n\r\nMore remarkable still were the conditions which we find after the\r\nestablishment of the empire and the extension of Roman territory\r\naround the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. There were no royal house,\r\nno hereditary nobility, and few special privileges left for the\r\ninhabitants of Rome. The distinctions between rich and poor were never\r\nmore galling; _but_ high birth conferred no great advantage, and the\r\nlowest born could rise to the highest posts of honor. The ponderous\r\nweight of the empire ground out racial and caste distinctions and\r\nwelded together all the heterogeneous mass. The provinces became\r\nRomanized, and the population of Rome became a mixture of all the\r\nraces of the provinces. Of how little importance Rome was to the\r\nlater empire is shown by the removal of the seat of the empire by\r\nConstantine to Constantinople, and the continued existence of an\r\nempire calling itself Roman for more than a thousand years after Rome\r\nhad ceased to constitute a part of such empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY REPUBLIC\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first epoch of the Roman republic is that extending from the\r\noverthrow of the kings, about 509 B.C., to the passage of the Licinian\r\nLaws in 367 B.C. The history of this century and a half at Rome is\r\nprimarily the history of internal strife and class antagonisms. During\r\nthese early days the progress made by the republic toward the\r\nexpansion of its territories or the extension of its foreign influence\r\nwas inappreciable.\r\n\r\nRome, during these days, was contending on a position of near equality\r\nwith the neighboring cities of Latium and Etruria. Twice during this\r\nperiod the independence, perhaps the very existence, of the city was\r\nseriously threatened.\r\n\r\nThe war against the Etruscans, which followed immediately upon the\r\nexpulsion of the last of the Tarquin kings, resulted so unfavorably to\r\nRome that not only was her territory considerably reduced in size but\r\neven the subjugation of Rome itself might probably have been\r\naccomplished but for the forbearance of her victorious opponents.\r\n\r\nLater, in 390 B.C., the capture and sack of Rome by the Gauls nearly\r\nproved the death-blow of the Roman republic. The internal dissensions\r\nof this period were mainly responsible for the lack of military\r\nsuccess. Although it is true that the history of early Rome, unlike\r\nthe histories of the various early Grecian states, records few\r\ninstances where hatred or bitterness arising from political defeat\r\ninduced a citizen to turn traitor to his country, and although the\r\napproach of a foreign foe was generally sufficient to bring about a\r\ntruce in Roman political hostilities and the union of all factions in\r\nthe city against the common national enemy, still it must be\r\nremembered that the amount of energy possessed by a community is\r\nlimited. When the all-absorbing questions agitating a people are those\r\nrelative to internal political contests, the energies of the ablest\r\nmen of each generation are spent mainly in political contests instead\r\nof being exerted for the common welfare of the community.\r\n\r\nThe influence which the internal dissensions at Rome must have\r\nexerted on her military success is shown by a comparison of the\r\nmilitary history of the Roman republic prior to 367 B.C. with the\r\nwonderful career of conquest which the Roman republic entered into\r\nimmediately after the passage of the Licinian Act. This act, although\r\nproducing a partial and temporary cessation of class contests at Rome,\r\nnevertheless sufficiently healed the internal wounds of the state to\r\nenable it to rapidly advance from a city-republic to a world power.\r\n\r\n     \"The results of this great change were singularly happy and\r\n     glorious. Two centuries of prosperity, harmony, and victory\r\n     followed the reconciliation of the orders. Men who\r\n     remembered Rome engaged in waging petty wars almost within\r\n     sight of the Capitol lived to see her the mistress of Italy.\r\n     While the disabilities of the plebeians continued, she was\r\n     scarcely able to maintain her ground against the Volscians\r\n     and Hernicans. When those disabilities were removed, she\r\n     rapidly became more than a match for Carthage and Macedon.\"\r\n     (Macaulay.)\r\n\r\nThe republic created at Rome in the course of the sixth century before\r\nChrist was distinctively an undemocratic republic. The benefits to the\r\nplebeians resulting from the overthrow of the kingdom were of slight,\r\nif any importance. The political power of the state remained almost\r\nentirely in the hands of the patricians, and the right to hold office\r\nwas restricted to the members of this caste. At this time the members\r\nof the patrician order were perhaps not very much inferior in numbers\r\nto the plebeian order; but the discrepancy between the numbers of the\r\ntwo orders so rapidly increased that by the beginning of the fourth\r\ncentury before Christ the government of Rome had become practically\r\nthat of an oligarchy.\r\n\r\nIn the latter days of the republic, in the contest which resulted in\r\nthe overthrow of the republic, the basic reasons for the struggle were\r\nof an economic rather than a political character. In the period now\r\nunder discussion the political element predominated in the class\r\ncontests, although various elements of disagreement were to be found\r\nexisting side by side.\r\n\r\n     \"Three distinct movements agitated the community. The first\r\n     proceeded from the body of full citizens, and was confined\r\n     to it; its object was to limit and lessen the life-power of\r\n     the single president or king; in all such movements at Rome,\r\n     from the time of the Tarquins to that of the Gracchi, there\r\n     was no attempt to assert the rights of the individual at the\r\n     expense of the state, nor to limit the power of the state,\r\n     but only that of its magistrates. The second was the demand\r\n     for equality of political privileges, and was the cause of\r\n     bitter struggles between the full burgesses and those,\r\n     whether plebeians, freedmen, Latins, or Italians, who keenly\r\n     resented their political inequality. The third movement was\r\n     an equally prolific source of trouble in Roman history; it\r\n     arose from the embittered relations between landholders and\r\n     those who had either lost possession of their farms, or, as\r\n     was the case with many small farmers, held possession at the\r\n     mercy of the capitalist or landlord. These three movements\r\n     must be clearly grasped, as upon them hinges the internal\r\n     history of Rome. Although often intertwined and confused\r\n     with one another, they were, nevertheless, essentially and\r\n     fundamentally distinct. The natural outcome of the first was\r\n     the abolition of the monarchy--a result which we find\r\n     everywhere, alike in Greek and Italian states, and which\r\n     seems to have been a certain evolution of the form of\r\n     constitution peculiar to both peoples.\" (Mommsen.)\r\n\r\nThe overthrow of the monarchy was accomplished quickly and\r\neffectively. Unlike the case in most countries, the monarchy once\r\noverthrown, there was no attempt for nearly five centuries to\r\nreëstablish it. The word \"king\" was regarded with such hatred that the\r\nmere accusation made against any public leader that he was seeking to\r\nmake himself king was generally sufficient to utterly destroy his\r\ninfluence, even when such charges were unfounded and unsupported by\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nThe men who established the new form of government created after the\r\nexpulsion of Tarquinius adopted the theory of political checks and\r\nbalances which we afterwards find exerting such a strong influence\r\nupon the framers of our American Constitution. It was necessary that\r\nat least a part of the powers formerly exercised by the king should be\r\nintrusted to some official under the new régime. The greatest efforts,\r\nhowever, were made to render it impossible for any Roman official to\r\nuse the governmental powers granted him in such a manner as to secure\r\nfor himself the kingly office. The mere provision that the highest\r\nofficial in the government should be elected, rather than succeed to\r\nthe office by right of descent, was rightly judged to be by itself an\r\ninsufficient protection against the seizure of supreme power by some\r\nRoman tyrant.\r\n\r\nA stronger safeguard was found in the division of the highest power in\r\nthe state between two officials, who later came to be known as\r\nconsuls. (The officers afterwards known as consuls were for a\r\nconsiderable period known as prætors; after the term consul came into\r\nuse the name prætor at a still later period was given to the possessor\r\nof a new office created shortly after the passage of the Licinian\r\nAct.) The kingly power, or that part of it not absolutely abolished or\r\ngiven to the religious officials, was vested jointly in the two\r\nconsuls, each possessing the full right to exercise all the functions\r\nof the office. Under this division of power each consul was considered\r\na most effective check upon any ambition for a crown which might be\r\npossessed by the other.\r\n\r\nAnother safeguard, a safeguard which unfortunately has recently been\r\ntoo much disregarded in the United States, consisted in the short term\r\nof office prescribed by the new law, the consuls and other Roman\r\nofficials being elected for a term of one year only.\r\n\r\nWhile, as has been said, the consuls retained in general all the\r\nformer powers of the king, still in some respects these powers were\r\ncurtailed:\r\n\r\n1. By the Valerian Law of 509 B.C. each person condemned by the consul\r\nto capital or corporal punishment was entitled to an appeal as a\r\nmatter of right. It had previously been optional with the king whether\r\nto grant an appeal.\r\n\r\n2. The consuls never possessed the various pecuniary rights of the\r\nkings, such as that of having the fields cultivated by the citizens.\r\n\r\n3. The quæstors, who had previously been appointed or not by the king\r\nhimself, as he saw fit, now became regular state officials.\r\n\r\n4. The religious duties and powers of the king did not pass to the\r\nconsul. The highest religious officer of the state, the _pontifex\r\nmaximus_, was from this time on elected by the Pontifical College. The\r\nvarious colleges of priests (all of whom had formerly been appointed\r\nby the king) now filled up vacancies in their own numbers. Other\r\nreligious officers were appointed by the pontifex maximus. On account\r\nof the close connection between the Roman religion and the Roman\r\ngovernment, the pontifex maximus became a strong political power in\r\nthe city. By the power of this officer and his associates to hold the\r\nauspices and regulate the calendar, they were enabled to prevent or\r\npermit the holding of the public assemblies, extend or decrease the\r\nterm of office of public officials, and exercise a greater or less\r\ninfluence on almost every public question or proceeding.\r\n\r\n5. The insignia and marks of dignity permitted to the consul were of a\r\nless imposing character than those previously granted to the king.\r\nWhile the king had been accompanied by twenty-four lictors, the consul\r\nwas permitted only twelve, and the axes were taken away. While the\r\nking had worn the purple robe, the consul wore merely the ordinary\r\nRoman toga with a purple border. The royal chariot of the king did not\r\ndescend to the consul, who was obliged to travel on foot within the\r\nlimits of the city.\r\n\r\n6. There had been no provision in the Roman law for any redress for a\r\nwrong done by the king, but the consul, upon the termination of his\r\nyear of office, stepped down at once into the mass of the citizens and\r\ncould at any time be punished for any malfeasance during his official\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n7. An indirect restriction of the powers of the consuls arose from the\r\nincreased dignity and authority of the Senate. The change in this\r\nrespect, however, was practical rather than theoretical. According to\r\nthe strict form of the law the Senate still bore the same relation to\r\nthe consuls that they had previously borne to the king. The Senate was\r\nstill nothing more than an advisory body, and all vacancies among the\r\nsenators were filled by appointments made by the consuls. The\r\nincreased importance of the Senate arose out of the advantage which an\r\nofficial holding office for life always possesses over a superior\r\nofficer holding office for only a brief term. In the present day it\r\nfrequently happens that a political appointee at the head of a\r\ndepartment or bureau, with the workings of which he is not familiar,\r\nfinds himself compelled to rely almost implicitly upon some\r\nsubordinate official whose working life has been spent in that office.\r\n\r\nThe short term of a consul and the life term of the members of the\r\nSenate thus tended to secure to this body an ever increasing\r\ninfluence. It was seldom that any serious conflict arose between the\r\nconsul and the Senate. The consuls were men who were already senators\r\nor who expected to become such, while of the senators, many had held\r\nthe office of consul and many more hoped to hold it in the future.\r\n\r\nThis curtailment of the kingly power and the division of the powers\r\nwhich remained between two consuls of equal rank, while it secured the\r\nprotection of the citizens from the danger of a new monarchy, strongly\r\nhindered vigor and unity of action in the prosecution of any\r\nenterprise. There were times, therefore, during the succeeding\r\ncenturies in the life of Rome, when to meet temporary emergencies a\r\nstronger and undivided rule was necessary. To meet this need a new\r\nofficial was created--the dictator--who might be nominated by one of\r\nthe consuls upon the authorization of the Senate and who, during the\r\nterm of his office, which could not exceed six months, possessed and\r\nexercised almost absolute authority at Rome, and superseded all the\r\nother officials in their duties.\r\n\r\nThe original intention was that such an official should be appointed\r\nonly in cases of military necessity, but later this office was\r\nfrequently created to aid the patricians in their contests with the\r\nplebeians. Only the patricians were eligible for any of the newly\r\ncreated offices. The Senate was composed exclusively of this order,\r\nand it has already been explained, in Chapter II, how, through the\r\nexpedient of putting more Roman citizens in some centuries than in the\r\nothers, the patricians were able to control the vote of the majority\r\nof the centuries in the comitia centuriata.\r\n\r\nIt is thus apparent that the mere overthrow of the kings at Rome had\r\naccomplished little for the ordinary Roman citizen. In fact, the rule\r\nof a single monarch is often more beneficial to the poorer classes of\r\na community than the rule of a favored class. The establishment of a\r\nrepublic, however, had eliminated one political element, and cleared\r\nthe stage for the contest between the patricians and plebeians.\r\n\r\nThat the economic condition of the poorer classes in Rome changed for\r\nthe worse after the institution of the republic is certain. It was for\r\nthe interest of the early Roman kings to favor and protect the small\r\nRoman farmers, both for military and economic reasons. While the\r\npermanent interests of the patricians would have been promoted by the\r\nencouragement of this class, their temporary selfish interests called\r\nfor the destruction of the Roman middle class, primarily the middle\r\nagricultural class, and the division of all Roman inhabitants into a\r\nsmall aristocracy on the one hand and a large proletariat on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe two forms of exactions which fell the heaviest upon the Roman\r\npoorer classes were the barbarous laws against debtors and the\r\ndishonest administration of the public leaders. The desperate\r\ncondition of the debtors at Rome at this time was a result of a number\r\nof different causes, including the high rate of interest, the right of\r\nthe creditor to sell the debtor into slavery if the debt were not\r\npaid, the policy of the patrician creditors to demand the last pound\r\nof flesh in all their transactions, and the conditions which existed\r\nin Rome at this time which compelled many small landowners, against\r\ntheir wish and without any fault of their own, to become borrowers of\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nOne harsh feature of this condition was the fact that it was the\r\nmilitary service, which as Roman citizens they were compelled to\r\nrender to the state, that more often than any other cause compelled\r\nthe plebeians to borrow money and thus ultimately drove them to their\r\nruin. For example, a small Roman farmer, through absence from his\r\nhome on military service for the state, might lose his crop for the\r\nyear. To support himself and his family until the next harvest, and to\r\nsupply the means for the planting of the next year's crop, he would be\r\nobliged to borrow money, which, under the exorbitant rates of\r\ninterest, soon reached an amount out of proportion to the original\r\nloan. Perhaps a second campaign would deprive him of the means of\r\nreturning the loan, and his lands would be taken from him and he\r\nhimself sold into slavery. As a final blow, the unfortunate plebeian\r\nsaw the lands which had been won for the state by armies composed of\r\nhis fellow plebeians reserved entirely for the use of the favored\r\npatrician order.\r\n\r\nNo more pernicious and unfair system could have been evolved than that\r\nwhich governed the management of the Roman public lands in the very\r\nfirst years of the republic. The earlier policy, under the kings, had\r\nbeen to divide the public land of the state into small allotments and\r\nto distribute it among those citizens of the state who most needed it.\r\nWith the republic this policy ceased, and the public lands were\r\nnominally retained in the public ownership, but in reality were let\r\nout on leases to the patricians and a few favored men among the\r\nplebeians.\r\n\r\nIn theory the state retained the right to take back the land at any\r\ntime and to receive a rent from the lessee; but in practice both these\r\nrights were disregarded. The lands held in this manner by the\r\npatricians were soon considered by them as much their own property as\r\nthose to which they held the legal title, and were devised and pledged\r\nby their owners in substantially the same manner as any other land.\r\nThe collection of the rent was soon abandoned; and not only this, but\r\nthe land being in theory state land, the lessee (who was supposed to,\r\nbut did not, pay rent) was not liable to pay taxes on this land.\r\n\r\nThe final working out of this matter may be summed up by saying that\r\nthe poorer class of the plebeians furnished most of the soldiers for\r\nthe campaign, stood most of the expense, suffered nearly all the\r\nlosses both of life and property, were excluded from any share in the\r\nland captured in the war, and as a culmination saw their taxes yearly\r\nincreased on account of the fact that the patricians, who monopolized\r\nthe public land, succeeded in dodging the payment of rent and in\r\nevading the payment of taxes.\r\n\r\nIt was these conditions which brought about the remarkable spectacle\r\nof what may be well designated the first recorded strike in history--a\r\nstrike in the Roman army. In 495 B.C. the Roman citizens were summoned\r\nto take the field for another military campaign. They refused to obey.\r\nOne of the consuls, Publius Servilius, however, induced them to make\r\nthe campaign by suspending some of the laws bearing most heavily upon\r\nthe poor and by releasing all persons in prison for debt. But hardly\r\nhad the army returned from a victorious campaign than the other\r\nconsul, Appius Claudius, as a reward for their victory began to\r\nenforce the debtor laws with extraordinary severity.\r\n\r\nOnce more, in the following year, the plebeians were induced to take\r\nthe field, mainly on account of the popularity of the dictator\r\nappointed for the management of this campaign, Marius Valerius, and\r\nhis promise that upon the termination of the campaign permanent\r\nreforms would be made in the law. Again the Roman army was victorious,\r\nand again the patricians broke faith with the plebeians and refused\r\nto carry out their promised reforms.\r\n\r\nThe next scene in this conflict is one almost without parallel, either\r\nin ancient or modern history. The plebeians, disgusted by the\r\nselfishness and perfidy of the patricians, determined to abandon Rome\r\nto the patrician order and to found a new city for themselves upon the\r\n\"Sacred Mount,\" a hill situated between the Tiber and the Anio. The\r\npatricians, thunderstruck by this unexpected movement, and being far\r\nmore in need of the plebeians than the plebeians were of them,\r\nimmediately made sufficient concessions to the plebeians to induce\r\nthem to return to Rome.\r\n\r\nSome of the concessions made at this time related to temporary\r\nprovisions for relief of debtors; but the great innovation was that\r\nwhich established the office of tribune. The character of the office\r\nof tribune is absolutely unique in the political history of the world.\r\nThe tribunes, elected by the people in the comitia tributa, were\r\nplebeian officers who were at first without any constructive part in\r\nthe carrying on of the Roman government and whose sole duty at the\r\noutset was to protect the members of the plebeian order from the\r\noppression of the patrician officials. This protection was exercised\r\nmainly through the use of the veto power given to the tribunes. Under\r\nthis power the tribunes had the right at any time to put a stop to any\r\nact either by any of the public assemblies, by the Senate, or by any\r\nof the magistrates. It was a power which, if exercised to its fullest\r\nextent, could put a stop to the very carrying on of the government.\r\n\r\nIt speaks much for the moderation of the Roman tribunes that through\r\nall the centuries of the Roman republic little serious inconvenience\r\nwas experienced from the use of this power. With few and unimportant\r\nexceptions, it was exercised only in cases where the welfare of the\r\nplebeians as a class, or of some particular plebeian, demanded it.\r\n\r\nThe creation of the office of tribune was merely one more example of\r\nthat system of checks and balances which played so prominent a part in\r\nthe framing of the government after the expulsion of the king--a\r\nsystem of checks and balances so strikingly resembling that in our\r\nFederal Constitution. The tribunes were introduced as a protection\r\nfor the plebeians and an additional restraint upon the magistrates.\r\n\r\nWhile at first the power and duties of the tribunes were entirely of a\r\nnegative nature, they gradually acquired an authority of a positive\r\ncharacter. The tribunes generally presided over the comitia tributa\r\nand took the lead in securing the passage of laws by that body. In\r\naddition they acquired judicial powers, and in cases where a plebeian\r\nhad been wronged they could summon any citizen, even the consuls,\r\nbefore them, and might impose even the death penalty. The persons of\r\nthe tribunes were declared inviolable, and any one who attacked them\r\nwas thought to be accursed. The number of the tribunes was at first\r\ntwo, but was later increased to five and still later to ten.\r\n\r\nThe second great victory won by the plebeians was in the passage of\r\nthe Publilian Law in 471 B.C. This law was proposed by the tribune\r\nValerius Publilius, and was brought about by the murder of the tribune\r\nGnæus Genucius. The main object of this law was the protection of the\r\nplebeian assembly and the plebeian officers, but its exact details are\r\nunknown. It is believed by some that the comitia tributa really came\r\ninto existence with this law, and that previously the plebeians had\r\nvoted by curies. The law limited to plebeian freeholders the right to\r\nvote in a plebeian assembly, and excluded nearly all the freedmen and\r\nclients who were under the influence of the patricians as well as the\r\npatricians themselves. It is possible also that the increase in the\r\nnumber of the tribunes from two to five was made by this law. In 462\r\nB.C. an unsuccessful attempt was made to abolish the office of\r\ntribune; in 457 B.C. came the increase from five tribunes to ten.\r\n\r\nFrom 451 to 450 B.C. the regular system of government at Rome was\r\ninterrupted by the election and rule of the _decemvirs_. The episode\r\nof these decemvirs has an important place in Roman history; but (as is\r\nthe case with all events in Roman history in the fifth century before\r\nChrist) our knowledge of these men, of their work, and of their\r\noverthrow is very uncertain. The election of these officials was\r\nprimarily brought about by the recognized necessity for a reform and\r\ncodification of the Roman laws. If the duties of these men had been\r\nlimited to the preparation of such code, its character and position\r\nwould not have been unsimilar to that of numerous other bodies of men\r\nappointed for a similar purpose in many countries and in all ages. But\r\nthe peculiarity about the work of the decemvirs lies in the fact that\r\nupon their appointment all the ordinary Roman offices were\r\ndiscontinued and the entire judicial and executive administration of\r\nthe state passed into the hands of the decemvirs.\r\n\r\nDuring their first year of office the decemvirs drew up ten tables of\r\nlaws, so called because the laws were engraved upon tables of copper\r\nand stood up in the Forum on the rostra in front of the Senate house.\r\n\r\nAccording to the legends (for the Roman historical records of this\r\ncentury are little more than such), it had originally been intended to\r\nintrust the decemvirs with power only for a single year, but their\r\nwork being incomplete at the expiration of the first year, they were\r\nchosen for a second year. It is uncertain whether the decemvirs for\r\nthe second year were exactly the same men as those for the first year.\r\nAccording to some reports some of the decemvirs of the second year\r\nwere plebeians, while none of those originally elected belonged to\r\nthat order.\r\n\r\nDuring their second year of office the decemvirs prepared two more\r\ntables of laws, and these, with the ten tables prepared during the\r\npreceding year, constituted the famous \"Law of the Twelve Tables,\" the\r\nfirst Roman code of which we have any knowledge. Only fragmentary\r\nextracts from these tables have come down to us, but these fragments\r\nfurnish us with such an insight into early Roman laws, institutions,\r\nand customs that they are here inserted:\r\n\r\n     THE TWELVE TABLES\r\n\r\n\r\n     TABLE I\r\n\r\n     THE SUMMONS BEFORE THE MAGISTRATE\r\n\r\n     1.

The stories as to the cause are not only\r\nconflicting but diametrically so. According to one historical theory,\r\nthe rebellion against the decemvirs began among the plebeians on\r\naccount of the oppression which they suffered from the hands of these\r\nmen; while, on the other hand, it is believed by many historians that\r\nthe decemvirs were overthrown by the patricians because they were\r\ngiving too many concessions to the plebeians. Whatever the cause, the\r\npower of the decemvirs was taken from them and all the former Roman\r\nofficials and assemblies were reëstablished, with the old powers and\r\njurisdictions. The \"Law of the Twelve Tables,\" which the decemvirs had\r\ndrawn up, however, remained for centuries as the great basis of Roman\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nFive years after the deposition of the decemvirs the tribune Canuleius\r\nsecured the passage by the comitia tributa of the Canuleian Law, which\r\nmarked another milestone passed by the plebeians in their march toward\r\nequality before the law.\r\n\r\nTwo great concessions were given by this act, one in the field of\r\nprivate and the other in the field of public law. The law which had\r\nexisted from the earliest days in Rome, and which had been\r\nincorporated in the \"Law of the Twelve Tables,\" prohibiting\r\nintermarriage between plebeians and patricians, was abolished. It was\r\nalso provided that any year the people, instead of electing consuls,\r\nmight elect military tribunes, who should possess all the powers,\r\nalthough not all the dignities, of the consuls. Either patricians or\r\nplebeians could be elected to the office of military tribunes.\r\n\r\nThe election of military tribunes was authorized by law many years\r\nbefore any such officials were elected in Rome; but the fear that the\r\nconsular power might sometime fall into the hands of a plebeian\r\ninduced the patricians in 443 B.C. to secure the passage of a law for\r\nthe creation of new officials who should possess some of the powers\r\npreviously held by the consul and who must be chosen from the\r\npatrician order.\r\n\r\nThese new officials, called censors, were to be two in number and were\r\nto be elected every five years. At first these officials held office\r\nuntil the time arrived for the election of their successors, but later\r\ntheir term of office was limited to one year and a half, there thus\r\nbeing three and one half years out of every five-year period when this\r\noffice was in abeyance.\r\n\r\nThe most important duty given to the censors at the outset seems to\r\nhave been the authority of filling vacancies in the Senate as it\r\nbecame necessary to keep the number up to the required three hundred.\r\nUp to this time this power of appointing senators had been exercised\r\nby the consul. As time went on, however, the powers of this office\r\nrapidly increased until at length it became the highest post of honor\r\nat Rome, the men elected censors being almost invariably former\r\nconsuls or military tribunes.\r\n\r\nThe arbitrary power of inquisition over all the public affairs of Rome\r\nand the private conduct of the Roman citizens was so astonishingly\r\ngreat that we wonder how it could have existed without constant and\r\ngross abuses. In the later days of the republic the censors had the\r\nright to make a so-called \"censorial note\" of all Roman citizens, who,\r\nwithout having gone to the point of violating the criminal law, or at\r\nleast without having been convicted of a crime, had been guilty of\r\ndishonorable or immoral conduct. All persons thus named suffered\r\nsevere civic penalties. If the person were a senator he lost his seat\r\nin the Senate; if a knight, he lost the peculiar privileges belonging\r\nto this rank. In every case the person lost his membership in the\r\nassociation of his tribe and was subject to increased taxation.\r\n\r\nThe exclusive right to serve as censors was one of the last exclusive\r\nprivileges retained by the patricians, the plebeians not being made\r\neligible to this office until 339 B.C.\r\n\r\nAlthough Rome was in an almost constant state of warfare during the\r\nfifth century before Christ, the conflicts were neither on a large\r\nscale nor decisive in their results. The chief enemies of Rome were\r\nthe neighboring Latin and Etruscan cities, with one or another of whom\r\nRome was almost constantly engaged in hostilities. At the beginning\r\nof the fourth century before Christ Rome was attacked by a new and\r\nmore terrible enemy from the north, who very nearly changed the whole\r\ncourse of the world's history by wiping the city of Rome out of\r\nexistence before its career of greatness had begun.\r\n\r\nThis enemy was the Gauls, who captured and burned Rome in the year 390\r\nB.C., but who failed to take the citadel of the city and finally\r\nwithdrew, either being driven away or bribed to depart. Not only are\r\nthe details of the capture of Rome by the Gauls very uncertain, but by\r\ndestroying all the old Roman records and many of the Roman monuments\r\nin their sack of Rome, the Gauls are responsible for much of the\r\nuncertainty which exists as to the truth of the details of the history\r\nof Rome prior to their invasion. In fact, it is generally considered\r\nthat the authentic history of Rome begins only after 390 B.C., the\r\nhistory of the Roman kingdom being little more than mythology; while\r\nwhat we know of the Roman republic prior to 390 B.C. consists of an\r\ninseparable mixture of true history and legendary tales.\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of the Gauls the question arose whether Rome\r\nshould be rebuilt on its old site or whether all the Romans should\r\nmigrate in a body to Veii. It was only after a long discussion that it\r\nwas finally decided to remain at Rome.\r\n\r\nThe rebuilding of Rome was immediately followed by another period of\r\nconflict between the patricians and plebeians. Two causes of\r\ndiscontent brought about the renewal of this contest. The first was\r\nthe financial condition of the poorer classes, who had been rendered\r\nmore desperate through the losses occasioned by the Gallic invasion;\r\nand second, the desire of the richer plebeians to share in the\r\npolitical honors reserved exclusively for the patricians.\r\n\r\nIn this contest the leaders of the plebeians were the tribunes Gaius\r\nLicinius and Lucius Sextius, who were, year after year, reëlected to\r\nthis office by the people.\r\n\r\nThe so-called Licinian Laws, first introduced by these tribunes in 376\r\nB.C., were adopted only after the most bitter political contest which\r\nup to this time had ever been fought in Rome. Time and again, the\r\ntribunes resorted to their veto power to put a stop to the carrying\r\non of every function of the Roman government. These laws were finally\r\npassed in 367 B.C., their three great provisions being as follows:\r\n\r\n1. That of all debts on which interest had been paid, the sum of the\r\ninterest paid should be deducted from the principal, and the remainder\r\npaid off in three successive years.\r\n\r\n2. That no citizen should hold more than five hundred _jugera_ (nearly\r\n320 acres) of the public land, or should feed on the public pastures\r\nmore than one hundred head of larger cattle and five hundred of\r\nsmaller, under penalty of a heavy fine.\r\n\r\n3. That henceforth consuls, not consular tribunes, should always be\r\nelected, and that one of the two consuls must be a plebeian.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Licinian Laws are generally held to have equalized the\r\ndifferent orders at Rome, to have terminated forever the bitter\r\njealousy between patricians and plebeians, to have put a stop for a\r\ntime to class controversies of all kinds, and to have rendered\r\npossible the great career of foreign conquest upon which Rome soon\r\nentered, the fact remains that the benefit of these laws was\r\nexperienced far more by the small class of wealthy plebeians than by\r\nthe great mass of this order.\r\n\r\nHenceforth, with very few exceptions, one consul was always a\r\nplebeian, Lucius Sextius being the first plebeian consul and Gaius\r\nLicinius the third; but the chance of being elected consul was in\r\nreality limited to a small class of plebeians and conferred little\r\npractical benefit upon the ordinary member of the order.\r\n\r\nThe laws for the relief of the poorer classes were not so fully\r\nenforced. In particular, the wealthy citizens holding large allotments\r\nof the public land found methods by which to evade the carrying out of\r\nthe provisions of this new law, and we are surprised to find Licinius\r\nhimself as one of the offenders in this respect.\r\n\r\nIt was in the period following the passage of the Licinian Laws that\r\nthe greatest inequalities in wealth began to appear at Rome, and the\r\nnumbers of free small landowners to decrease.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Licinian Laws and of the following period show\r\nconclusively how mere political equality is never sufficient to secure\r\nthe welfare of the mass of the community, and that the power held by\r\na class possessed of great wealth, but without special political\r\nprivileges, is greater than that of a recognized nobility, and far\r\nmore apt to be abused, on account of the absence of any feeling of\r\nclass honor.\r\n\r\nTwo slight efforts were made by the patricians to counteract the\r\npolitical provisions of the Licinian Laws. For the first eleven years\r\nafter the passage of the Licinian Laws one consul was a plebeian and\r\none a patrician. In the thirteen years beginning with 355 B.C., two\r\npatricians were elected consuls in eight of the years; after this,\r\nviolations of the law ceased, and one consul belonged to each order\r\ndown to the year 172 B.C., when both consulships were open to the\r\nplebeians. The wealthy class of both orders had been so mingled by\r\nthis time that thereafter consuls were elected indiscriminately from\r\neither order, although this election was almost invariably restricted\r\nto the members of the great families.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the passage of the Licinian Laws the patricians\r\nsecured the creation of a new office. The man holding this office was\r\ncalled _prætor_, and was given the judicial powers formerly belonging\r\nto the consuls. At a later period the number of prætors was increased\r\nto two, one of whom, known as the _prætor urbanus_, had jurisdiction\r\nover controversies between Roman citizens, and the other, the _prætor\r\nperegrinus_, who had jurisdiction over controversies between\r\nforeigners residing at Rome and between Romans and foreigners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE PERIOD OF FOREIGN CONQUEST\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most glorious period of Roman history, from the military\r\nstandpoint, followed closely upon the cessation of fierce national\r\ncontests in the fourth century before Christ. The united efforts of\r\npatricians and plebeians, devoted to the task of foreign conquest,\r\nproved sufficient in a few generations to win for Rome her world\r\nempire.\r\n\r\n     \"The fifth century is the most beautiful century of Rome.\r\n     The plebeians had conquered the consulship and are\r\n     succeeding in conquering their admission to other\r\n     magistracies which the patricians wished to reserve; they\r\n     free themselves from the servitude which, under the name of\r\n     Nexus, weighed on the debtors. They arrive at political\r\n     equality and individual independence; at the same time the\r\n     old aristocracy still dominates in the Senate and maintains\r\n     there the inflexibility of its resolves and the persistence\r\n     of its designs. It was thanks to this interior condition\r\n     that the Roman people was able to survive the strongest\r\n     tests from without over which it had triumphed, and to make\r\n     that progress which cost it most dear. We see the peoples\r\n     fight, one by one, and often all together; the Latin people,\r\n     the Etruscans, the Goths, the Samnites, the other Sabellic\r\n     peoples of the Apennines; and the end is always victory.\r\n     The beginnings of this history were somber. Rome was\r\n     afflicted by one of those pestilences which one finds in all\r\n     the epochs of the history of this unsanitary city. Thence\r\n     was the origin of those scenic pieces imported by the\r\n     Etruscans and giving origin to comedy--a means devised to\r\n     appease the gods; so that Roman comedy had an origin\r\n     religious and dismal. The fifth century is for Rome the age\r\n     of great devotions and of grand sacrifices.\" (J. J. Ampère\r\n     in _L'empire romaine à Rome_.)\r\n\r\nA full description of the various military campaigns of Rome would\r\ntend to obscure rather than to illumine the political and economic\r\nhistory of the city. An enumeration of the foreign conquests of Rome\r\nduring this period, however, is necessary to indicate the rapid\r\nincrease in the territorial possessions of Rome, with their inevitable\r\nreaction upon the domestic conditions of the republic.\r\n\r\nThe first wars of Rome after the passage of the Licinian Laws were\r\nrenewed contests with her neighboring enemies. In 361 B.C. Rome was\r\nagain threatened by a new invasion of the Gauls. The following year\r\nthe Roman records mention a victory over the Hernicans by one Roman\r\nconsul, and over the Gauls, and the Latins of Tibur, by the other.\r\nThis alliance of the Gauls with a portion of the Latins so alarmed\r\nthe majority of the Latin cities that a new league between the Romans\r\nand Latins was formed in 358 B.C. The Gauls soon after retired from\r\nthe neighborhood of Latium, and their allies, Tibur and Privernum,\r\nwere compelled to enter the new Latin League.\r\n\r\nA war waged against Rome by the Etruscan city of Tarquinii and its\r\nallies so seriously threatened Rome that the Roman political factions\r\nforgot their differences so far as to agree to the appointment (for\r\nthe first time in the history of the city) of a plebeian, in the\r\nperson of C. Marcius Rutilus, to the office of dictator. The old\r\njealousy of the patricians, however, was soon manifested again in the\r\nopposition of the Senate to the granting of a triumph to this plebeian\r\nfor the great military victory which he soon won.\r\n\r\nIn 350 B.C. a third invasion of the Gauls was repulsed by the Romans.\r\n\r\nThe next great contest in which Rome was engaged was that with the\r\nSamnites. This race was both the most worthy and the most bitter of\r\nthe enemies of Rome within Italy, and the long warfare between Rome\r\nand the Samnites was terminated only by the practical extermination\r\nof the latter race. The First Samnite War extended from 343 to 341\r\nB.C. and was indecisive in its results, the Samnites at its close\r\nagreeing to give a year's pay and three months' provisions to the\r\nRoman army, and being permitted to make war on the Sidicini.\r\n\r\nThe close of the First Samnite War was followed closely by the Latin\r\nWar (340-338 B.C.). This war was brought about by the jealousy felt by\r\nthe other Latin towns toward Rome. Rome had been abusing her position\r\nas the capital of the Latin League, and desired to acquire an\r\nacknowledged supremacy over Latium. The war was an effort on the part\r\nof the other Latin cities to restrain the too rapidly increasing power\r\nof Rome and to reëstablish the balance of power in Latium. In this war\r\nwas seen the extraordinary spectacle of the Samnites appearing as\r\nallies of Rome. The Hernicans also aided the Romans, and the Sidicini\r\nand Campanians aided the Latins. The war resulted in the complete\r\noverthrow of the Latins; but the Romans showed great generosity and\r\ngood judgment in their treatment of the conquered cities after the\r\nwar, and thus did much toward binding the Latins to Rome for the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThe main provisions of the peace agreements were as follows: Roman\r\ncitizenships, in different degrees, were conferred upon the\r\ninhabitants of the various Latin towns, who were, however, forbidden\r\nto form any leagues among themselves or to hold diets; intermarriage\r\nand commerce between the different Latin towns were prohibited; the\r\n_municipium_ such as the Latins had previously possessed was given to\r\nthe citizens of Capua, Cumæ, Formiæ, Fundi, and Suessula; the Latin\r\ncontingents in the Roman army were henceforth to be permitted to serve\r\napart from the legions under their own officers; and the Latin public\r\nland, two thirds of that of Privernum, and the lands in the Falernian\r\ndistrict of Campania were taken by Rome, as were also the lands of the\r\nprincipal families of Velitræ, who were compelled to emigrate beyond\r\nthe Tiber.\r\n\r\nTen years of peace followed, and then came the second and greatest of\r\nthe Samnite wars (327-304 B.C.). The Samnites were aided during part\r\nof the war by the Etruscans and the Hernicans, but at the end the\r\nSamnites were compelled to acknowledge the supremacy of Rome and give\r\nup their independence. The Hernicans were completely overthrown in 307\r\nB.C., and were united to Rome on conditions very similar to those\r\npossessed by the Latins.\r\n\r\nIn the Third Samnite War (298-290 B.C.) the Romans were again\r\nvictorious, although a league of Samnites, Etruscans, Gauls, and\r\nUmbrians was formed against them. The exact terms of the treaty of\r\npeace at the conclusion of this war are not recorded, but undoubtedly\r\nriveted Roman control still more strongly upon Samnium.\r\n\r\nIt was the final result of the Roman-Samnite wars which finally\r\ndetermined the question of the overlordship of Italy. Of all the\r\nnumerous races of Italy, two and only two possessed the stamina which\r\nrendered them possible unifiers of the whole peninsula. Rome's defeat\r\nof Samnium left her without a rival in Italy and ready for contests\r\nwith her later and greater rivals. The close of the Third Samnite War,\r\nhowever, did not end the resistance of the Samnites to Roman rule.\r\nEven down to the time of the contests of Marius and Sulla we find this\r\nrace grasping every opportunity to strike a blow against Roman\r\ndominion.\r\n\r\nIn 284 B.C. the Tarentines succeeded in bringing about a union of the\r\nSamnites, Lucanians, Umbrians, Bruttians, Etruscans, and Gauls against\r\nRome. This war was a series of victories for the Romans. By the year\r\n282 B.C. all of the Roman enemies were subdued except the Etruscans,\r\nwith whom the war continued until 280 B.C. In this last-named year the\r\nRomans, alarmed by the danger of war with Pyrrhus, concluded a peace\r\nwith the Etruscans on such terms as changed these people from\r\nbitterest enemies into most faithful allies.\r\n\r\nThe time had now arrived when Rome was called upon for the first time\r\nto cross arms with enemies from beyond the Italian peninsula. The\r\nfirst of these contests with a foreign power was fought out entirely\r\nwithin the confines of Italy.\r\n\r\nThe year 280 B.C. saw the beginning of the contest between Rome and\r\nPyrrhus, king of Epirus, who had been summoned to Italy as an ally of\r\nthe Greek city of Tarentum. At the outset the Romans suffered two\r\ngreat defeats, at Heraclea and on the plain of Apulian Asculum,\r\nlargely through their inability to meet the attacks of the phalanxes\r\nand of the war elephants. In the end, however, Pyrrhus, although aided\r\nby all the enemies of Rome in southern and central Italy, ended his\r\ncampaign in failure and returned to Epirus in 275 B.C., his dream of a\r\ngreat western empire forever shattered.\r\n\r\nIn the ten years following the departure of Pyrrhus the subjugation of\r\nall Italy was completed, followed by a reorganization of the\r\ngovernment of the Roman colonies and subject cities.\r\n\r\nThe second foreign enemy of Rome was Carthage, and the most dramatic\r\npages in the whole history of Roman conquest are those which relate\r\nthe story of the contest between these two titanic rivals for world\r\nsupremacy. The immediate cause of the First Punic War arose over the\r\npossession of Messana, a city in Sicily separated from Italy by only a\r\nnarrow strait; but war between Rome and Carthage was inevitable; and\r\nif Messana had not become the bone of contention, another would have\r\nbeen found. The First Punic War lasted from 264 to 241 B.C. and\r\nresulted in victory for Rome. By the terms of peace Carthage gave up\r\nSicily and all the small islands between Sicily and Italy, and paid a\r\nheavy war indemnity to Rome. Shortly after the close of the war the\r\nRomans, by threats, compelled the Carthaginians to surrender also the\r\nislands of Sardinia and Corsica.\r\n\r\nIn 230 B.C. the Romans were engaged in war with the Illyrian pirates;\r\nand from 226 to 221 B.C. with the Insubrian Gauls, both of which\r\nconflicts resulted in easy victories for the Roman arms.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Hamilcar, his son Hannibal, and his son-in-law\r\nHasdrubal had been busy in Spain, reducing it under Carthaginian rule\r\nand preparing it to be used as a base of operation from which an\r\ninvasion of Italy might be attempted whenever a favorable opportunity\r\nshould present itself.\r\n\r\nIn 227 B.C. the Romans, becoming alarmed at the spread of the\r\nCarthaginian empire in Spain, insisted on a treaty by which the river\r\nEbro was fixed as the northern boundary beyond which the control of\r\nCarthage should never extend. In 219 B.C. Hannibal (whose father and\r\nbrother-in-law had by this time both fallen in the war) attacked the\r\ncity of Saguntum, which, though south of the Ebro, was an ally of\r\nRome. No heed being taken of the Roman remonstrances, war was again\r\ndeclared.\r\n\r\nThe Second Punic War lasted from 218 to 202 B.C. The early years of\r\nthis war saw a long series of Carthaginian victories, and their great\r\ngeneral, Hannibal, has ever since ranked as one of the greatest\r\nmilitary geniuses in history. This war, however, has been well\r\ndescribed as that of a man against a nation; and in the end the nation\r\nconquered. The final battle was that of Zama, fought in Africa in 202\r\nB.C.\r\n\r\nBy the terms of the treaty of peace made at the close of this war\r\nCarthage surrendered to Rome all her territorial possessions outside\r\nof Africa, all her elephants, and all her war ships except three\r\ntriremes, and also bound herself to pay a heavy annual tribute for\r\nfifty years. In addition, Carthage was prohibited from making war,\r\nunder any circumstances, outside of Africa, nor within Africa except\r\nwith the consent of Rome; and was compelled to return to the ally of\r\nthe Romans, Masinissa, king of Numidia, all the territory and property\r\nwhich had been taken from him or his predecessors by Carthage. In\r\nmany respects, however, the treaty was favorable to Carthage, who was\r\npermitted to keep her African territory practically intact, who was\r\nalso permitted to keep her independence, and was not required to\r\nreceive any Roman garrison.\r\n\r\nThe Second Punic War was the decisive contest between Rome and\r\nCarthage, the First Punic War being indecisive and the third being\r\nmerely the destruction of an already conquered people. This Second\r\nPunic War, however, was something more than the decisive contest\r\nbetween Rome and Carthage; it was the decisive contest between two\r\ncontinents, two races, two systems of institutions. The battle of\r\nMetaurus has justly been classed as one of the decisive battles of the\r\nworld. The capture of Rome by Hannibal could not have failed to have\r\nentirely altered the whole future course of history. If Hannibal had\r\nbeen able to carry back to Carthage the spoils of a conquered Rome he\r\nwould also have carried with them to Africa the scepter of world\r\nempire. He would have wrested race supremacy and the leading place in\r\ncivilization from the Aryan for the Hamitic races. For many\r\ncenturies, at least, the center of power and civilization would have\r\nbeen upon the southern instead of the northern shores of the\r\nMediterranean, and it is at least doubtful whether, even to-day, the\r\nnorthern races could have completely eradicated the effects of such an\r\nevent.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the earlier triumphs of Persia and Greece, it was not\r\nuntil the Roman victory over the Carthaginians that the position of\r\nthe Aryan races became definitely assured.\r\n\r\nMommsen writes on the results of the Second Punic War as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"It remains for us to sum up the results of this terrible\r\n     war, which for seventeen years had devastated the lands and\r\n     islands from the Hellespont to the Pillars of Hercules. Rome\r\n     was henceforth compelled by the force of circumstances to\r\n     assume a position at which she had not directly aimed, and\r\n     to exercise sovereignty over all the lands of the\r\n     Mediterranean. Outside Italy there arose the two new\r\n     provinces in Spain, where the natives lived in a state of\r\n     perpetual insurrection; the kingdom of Syracuse was now\r\n     included in the Roman province of Sicily; a Roman instead of\r\n     a Carthaginian protectorate was now established over the\r\n     most important Numidian chiefs; Carthage was changed from a\r\n     powerful commercial state into a defenseless mercantile\r\n     town. Thus all the western Mediterranean passed under the\r\n     supremacy of Rome. In Italy itself, the destruction of the\r\n     Celts became a mere question of time: the ruling Latin\r\n     people had been exalted by the struggle to a position of\r\n     still greater eminence over the heads of the non-Latin or\r\n     Latinized Italians such as the Etruscans and Sabellians in\r\n     lower Italy. A terrible punishment was inflicted on the\r\n     allies of Hannibal. Capua was reduced from the position of\r\n     second city to that of first village in Italy; the whole\r\n     soil, with a few exceptions, was declared to be public\r\n     domain-land, and was leased out to small occupiers. The same\r\n     fate befell the Picentes on the Silarus. The Bruttians\r\n     became in a manner bondsmen to the Romans and were forbidden\r\n     to carry arms. All the Greek cities which had supported\r\n     Hannibal were treated with great severity; and in the case\r\n     of a number of Apulian, Lucanian, and Samnite communities a\r\n     loss of territory was inflicted, and new colonies were\r\n     planted. Throughout Italy the non-Latin allies were made to\r\n     feel their utter subjection to Rome, and the comedies of the\r\n     period testify to the scorn of the victorious Romans.\r\n\r\n     \"It seems probable that not less than three hundred thousand\r\n     Italians perished in this war, the brunt of which loss fell\r\n     chiefly on Rome. After the battle of Cannæ it was found\r\n     necessary to fill up the hideous gap in the Senate by an\r\n     extraordinary nomination of 177 senators; the ordinary\r\n     burgesses suffered hardly less severely. Further, the\r\n     terrible strain on the resources of the state had shaken the\r\n     national economy to its very foundations. Four hundred\r\n     flourishing townships had been utterly ruined. The blows\r\n     inflicted on the simple morality of the citizens and farmers\r\n     by a camp life worked no less mischief. Gangs of robbers and\r\n     desperadoes plundered Italy in dangerous numbers. Home\r\n     agriculture saw its existence endangered by the proof, first\r\n     given in war, that the Roman people could be supported by\r\n     foreign grain from Sicily and Egypt. Still, at the close and\r\n     happy issue of so terrible a struggle, Rome might justly\r\n     point with pride to the past and with confidence to the\r\n     future. In spite of many errors she had survived all danger,\r\n     and the only question now was whether she would have the\r\n     wisdom to make right use of her victory, to bind still more\r\n     closely to herself the Latin people, to gradually Latinize\r\n     all her Italian subjects, and to rule her foreign dependents\r\n     as subjects, not as slaves--whether she would reform her\r\n     constitution and infuse new vigor into the unsound and\r\n     fast-decaying portion of her state.\"\r\n\r\nUp to the close of the third century before Christ the wars of Rome\r\nhad been mainly forced upon her by the aggressions of others, or had\r\ngrown out of disputes which had arisen in the natural course of\r\nevents; but after the battle of Zama, Rome entered deliberately upon a\r\ncareer of foreign conquest.\r\n\r\nIn 200 B.C. a Roman army invaded Macedon, and Philip, the king of this\r\ncountry, was completely defeated at the battle of Cynoscephalæ in 197\r\nB.C., but the Romans consented to easy terms of peace at this time on\r\naccount of the expectation of a war with Syria. The first war between\r\nRome and Antiochus the Great, king of Syria, began in 191 B.C. and\r\nended in 187 B.C. By the terms of peace Antiochus gave up all his\r\nclaims in Europe, and in Asia west of the Taurus.\r\n\r\nThe Second Macedonian War began in 172 B.C. and was concluded by the\r\ngreat Roman victory at Pydna in 168 B.C. Macedon was at first divided\r\ninto four republics, between which the rights of _connubium_ and\r\n_commercium_ were prohibited, but soon sank into the condition of a\r\nRoman province. Roman influence and interference were also rapidly\r\nincreasing in Greece during this period, although no formal annexation\r\nof territory was made at this time.\r\n\r\nThe Third Punic War (149-146 B.C.), forced by Rome upon an almost\r\nhelpless antagonist, resulted in the complete overthrow of the\r\ngreatest of Rome's rivals. Carthage was completely destroyed, and\r\nAfrica became a Roman province.\r\n\r\nThe Achæan War (147-146 B.C.) resulted in the practical subjection of\r\nall Greece to Rome; and between the years 143 and 133 B.C. the\r\nconquest of Spain was completed.\r\n\r\nThe interest in Roman history during the period from 367 to 133 B.C.\r\nis mainly centered in the military achievements of the republic, but\r\ncertain events in the political history of Rome during this period\r\nmust be noted before passing to a consideration of the violent\r\npolitical conflicts which arose over the proposed reforms of the\r\nGracchi.\r\n\r\nBy the Lex Horatia and the Lex Publilia (339 B.C.) it was provided\r\nthat the _plebiscita_ (that is, the decrees of the comitia tributa)\r\nshould be binding as laws; that one of the censors must be a plebeian;\r\nand that the subsequent ratification by the Senate should not be\r\nnecessary to render valid the laws passed by the comitia centuriata.\r\n\r\nIn 326 B.C. the Lex Poetelia Papiria prohibited debtors from assigning\r\nthemselves as security for debts. This did not interfere with the\r\nselling of a debtor into slavery by means of the _legis actio per\r\nmanus injectionem_; it merely prohibited the debtor from using himself\r\nas a special pledge to secure the payment of the debt.\r\n\r\nIn 304 B.C. the plebeians secured the publication of a manual\r\ncontaining full information as to the proper steps in the proceedings\r\nin the various _legis actiones_, and also as to the _dies fasti_. In\r\nthe early days at Rome all legal knowledge had belonged to the\r\npatricians, who had always strenuously resisted any movement toward\r\nmaking such information open to all. An exclusive knowledge of the law\r\nis of great advantage to any special class in any community, and one\r\neagerly sought under different disguises in many countries. The\r\npresent attempt to monopolize legal education in the United States,\r\nand to attack all movements which might tend to a general diffusion of\r\nlegal knowledge among the mass of the community, is merely another\r\nmanifestation of the same spirit which animated the Roman patricians\r\nin their long contests to keep all legal knowledge away from the\r\nplebeians. While the study of all professions which have no political\r\nsignification, such as that of medicine, may safely be regulated by\r\nthe government, and while the government may without injustice impose\r\nproper qualifications upon those who desire to practice law as their\r\nprofession, any attempt of the government to restrict the teaching or\r\nstudy of the law, or to impose upon those desiring to take bar\r\nexaminations restrictions intended merely to keep out of the\r\nprofession those not fortunate enough to belong to the wealthy\r\nclasses, can be intended only as an attack on democratic principles\r\nand as an attempt to create a monopoly of legal learning for improper\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nIn 286 B.C. was passed the Hortensian Law, which brought about the\r\ncomplete political equality of plebeians and patricians, whatever\r\nslight distinctions still remained being removed by this law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE TRIBES, THE COLONIES, AND THE PROVINCES\r\n\r\n\r\nComplete equality of political and civil rights has never existed, in\r\nany republic, among those subject to the laws; and throughout the\r\nwhole history of the Roman republic the most striking discriminations\r\nexisted between different strata in the political and economic\r\norganizations.\r\n\r\nThe contests arising from caste distinctions among the Romans\r\nthemselves are discussed in other chapters of this volume; it is here\r\nproposed to treat of the distinctions existing between Roman citizens,\r\nallies, and subjects and to describe briefly the status of each class.\r\n\r\nJust as in the days of the Roman kingdom the test of Roman citizenship\r\nwas membership in one of the curiæ, so in the time of the republic the\r\ntest became membership in one of the tribes.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the republic the number of tribes was twenty-one.\r\nFour new tribes were established in 387 B.C. in the conquered\r\nterritories of Veii, Capena, and Falerii. Other tribes were from time\r\nto time created, until by the time of the close of the war with\r\nPyrrhus the total number of tribes was thirty-three. The twelve new\r\ntribes occupied a district beyond the Tiber extending a little farther\r\nthan Veii, a portion of the Sabine and Aequian territory beyond the\r\nAnio, part of Latium, part of the Volscian territory, and the coast\r\nlands as far as the Liris. The last addition to the number of tribes\r\nat Rome took place in 235 B.C., when the number was increased to\r\nthirty-five.\r\n\r\nThe struggles in Rome for the extension of political rights and\r\nprivileges were always of a concrete, never of an abstract character.\r\nWe find none of the philosophy of Montesquieu among the Romans; no\r\ndiscussion of natural rights, no effort for the securing of political\r\nequality in the abstract. The Roman contests for liberty were always\r\nof a strictly practical and, it might perhaps be added, of a strictly\r\nselfish character. We find a series of conflicts, in each of which a\r\ncertain class of the citizens (or subjects) of Rome fought for the\r\nright to be enrolled among those possessed of Roman political rights.\r\n\r\nAt first the contests were all between the actual inhabitants of Rome\r\nitself. The political controversies, however, did not terminate upon\r\nthe admission of the plebeians to full political rights. After the\r\nplebeians had won their contests there came the Latins, and after the\r\nLatins the Italians.\r\n\r\nThe relation between early Rome and the other cities of Latium was of\r\nthe closest character. From the remotest times, long before the\r\nfoundation of Rome, a league of Latin cities was in existence. At the\r\nhead of this league stood Alba Longa (the long white city). Rome in an\r\nearly period in her history overthrew Alba Longa and succeeded to her\r\nplace at the head of the confederacy. While, however, the primary of\r\nAlba Longa had never extended beyond giving to that city the honorary\r\npresidency of the league, making it the religious center of Latium,\r\nthe leadership of Rome was of a real and substantial character. By the\r\nterms of agreement between the members of the new Latin League, Rome\r\nwas tacitly ranked as the equal of the other cities combined, it being\r\nagreed that all territory won by the league in war should be divided,\r\none half to Rome and one half among the other cities. The rights of\r\nintermarriage and of trade existed between all the cities of the\r\nleague.\r\n\r\nIn 384 B.C. Rome was strong enough to compel the league to agree to\r\nthe closing of its membership. At that time there were in the league\r\nthirty towns with full Latin rights and seventeen towns without the\r\nright of voting. Towns which in the future should become connected\r\nwith the league were to have the rights of intermarriage and of trade\r\nonly with Rome.\r\n\r\nThe Latin League came to an end in 338 B.C. The extension of the\r\nrights of Roman citizenship, either complete or qualified, to other\r\nraces in Italy is referred to in other chapters of this book. The\r\nhistory of this subject is thus summarized by Mommsen:\r\n\r\n     \"It remains for us to consider the political effect of the\r\n     mighty changes consequent upon the establishment of Roman\r\n     supremacy in Italy. We do not know with exactness what\r\n     privileges Rome reserved for herself as sovereign state. It\r\n     is certain that she alone could make war, conclude treaties,\r\n     and coin money; and that, further, any war or treaty\r\n     resolved upon by the Roman people was legally binding on all\r\n     Italian communities, and that the silver money of Rome was\r\n     current everywhere in Italy.\r\n\r\n     \"The relations of the Italians to Rome cannot in all cases\r\n     be precisely defined, but the main features are as follows.\r\n     In the first place, the full Roman franchise was extended as\r\n     far as was compatible with the preservation of the urban\r\n     character of the Roman community. Those who received this\r\n     franchise may be divided into three classes. First, all the\r\n     occupants of the various allotments of state lands, now\r\n     embracing a considerable portion of Etruria and Campania,\r\n     were included. Second, all the communities which, after the\r\n     method first adopted in the case of Tusculum, were\r\n     incorporated and completely merged in the Roman state....\r\n     Finally, full Roman citizenship was possessed by the\r\n     maritime or burgess colonies which had been instituted for\r\n     the protection of the coast....\r\n\r\n     \"Thus the title of Roman citizen in its fullest sense was\r\n     possessed by men dwelling as far north as Lake Sabatinus, as\r\n     far east as the Apennines, and as far south as Formiæ. But\r\n     within those limits isolated communities such as Tibur,\r\n     Præneste, Signia, and Norba, were without the Roman\r\n     franchise; while beyond them other communities, such as\r\n     Sena, possessed it.\r\n\r\n     \"In the next place, we must distinguish the various grades\r\n     of subjection which marked all the communities not honored\r\n     with the full Roman franchise. As in the case of the\r\n     recipients of full citizenship, so here we may make a\r\n     threefold division. To the first division belong the Latin\r\n     towns: these retained their Latin rights; that is, they were\r\n     self-governing and stood on an equal footing with Roman\r\n     citizens as regards the right of trading and inheritance.\r\n     But it is important to observe that the Latins of the later\r\n     times of the republic were no longer for the most part\r\n     members of the old Latin towns, which had participated in\r\n     the Alban festival, but were colonists planted in Latium by\r\n     Rome, who honored Rome as their capital and parent city, and\r\n     formed the main supports of Roman rule in Latium. Indeed,\r\n     the old Latin communities, with the exception of Tibur and\r\n     Præneste, had sunk into insignificance. It was but natural\r\n     that the Latin colonies, issuing as they did from the\r\n     burgess-body of Rome, should not rest content with mere\r\n     Latin rights, but should aim at the full rights of Roman\r\n     citizens. Rome, on the other hand, now that Italy was\r\n     subjugated, no longer felt her former need of these\r\n     colonies; nor did she deem it prudent to extend the full\r\n     franchise with the same freedom as she hitherto had done....\r\n\r\n     \"To the second division belong those towns whose inhabitants\r\n     were passive citizens of Rome (_cives sine suffragio_). They\r\n     were liable to service in the Roman legions and to taxation,\r\n     and were included in the Roman census. A deputy or prefect\r\n     appointed annually by the Roman prætor administered justice\r\n     according to laws which were subjected to Roman revision.\r\n\r\n     \"In the third and last division we may include all allied\r\n     communities which were not Latin states; the relation of\r\n     these towns to Rome was defined by separate treaties, and\r\n     therefore varied in accordance with the terms imposed by\r\n     such agreements....\r\n\r\n     \"It had taken Rome 120 years to complete the union of the\r\n     Italian peninsula, broken up as it was by mountain ranges\r\n     and naturally favoring the formation and preservation of\r\n     various isolated states. But union it was, rather than a\r\n     subjugation, and each nation was left to the practical\r\n     management of its own affairs. Content with self-government,\r\n     the various communities, for the most part, easily bore the\r\n     yoke of Roman supremacy. Eventually all the municipal towns\r\n     received the full Roman franchise (90 B.C.), and thus\r\n     established the municipal principle of government which\r\n     endures to the present day.\"\r\n\r\nThe rights of Roman citizenship were never generally given outside of\r\nthe Italian peninsula, although such rights were granted to a few\r\nfavored individuals in all portions of the Roman world. The possession\r\nof these rights was the greatest privilege which could be acquired by\r\nany subject of Rome. Even when the strictly political rights of such\r\ncitizen disappeared under the empire, the personal distinction and\r\nprotection connected with this citizenship remained. As striking an\r\nevidence of the dignity and privileges of a Roman citizen as could be\r\ndesired is found in the Bible in the twenty-second chapter of Acts:\r\n\r\n     \"The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the\r\n     castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging;\r\n     that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.\r\n\r\n     \"And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the\r\n     centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a\r\n     man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?\r\n\r\n     \"When the centurion heard _that_, he went and told the chief\r\n     captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is\r\n     a Roman.\r\n\r\n     \"Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me,\r\n     art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.\r\n\r\n     \"And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I\r\n     this freedom. And Paul said, But I was _free_ born.\r\n\r\n     \"Then straightway they departed from him which should have\r\n     examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after\r\n     he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of the Second Punic War Rome was in possession of five\r\nprovinces--Sicily, Sardinia, Hither Spain, Farther Spain, and the\r\nGallic coast of Umbria. This latter province soon became an integral\r\npart of Italy, but the number of Roman provinces was kept at five by\r\nthe creation of the province of Cisalpine Gaul. From this time on the\r\nnumber of Roman provinces rapidly increased. The existence of the\r\nprovinces perpetuated the existence of various classes of political\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nWe will close this account with a description by Gibbon of the\r\nrelations between Rome and the provinces as they existed during the\r\nclosing years of the republic and the early days of the empire:\r\n\r\n     \"Till the privileges of Romans had been progressively\r\n     extended to all the inhabitants of the empire, an important\r\n     distinction was preserved between Italy and the provinces.\r\n     The former was esteemed the centre of public unity, and the\r\n     firm basis of the constitution. Italy claimed the birth, or\r\n     at least the residence, of the emperors and the senate. The\r\n     estates of the Italians were exempt from taxes, their\r\n     persons from the arbitrary jurisdiction of governors. Their\r\n     municipal corporations, formed after the perfect model of\r\n     the capital, were intrusted, under the immediate eye of the\r\n     supreme power, with the execution of the laws. From the foot\r\n     of the Alps to the extremity of Calabria, all the natives of\r\n     Italy were born citizens of Rome. Their partial distinctions\r\n     were obliterated, and they insensibly coalesced into one\r\n     great nation, united by language, manners, and civil\r\n     institutions, and equal to the weight of a powerful empire.\r\n     The republic gloried in her generous policy, and was\r\n     frequently rewarded by the merit and services of her adopted\r\n     sons. Had she always confined the distinction of Romans to\r\n     the ancient families within the walls of the city, that\r\n     immortal name would have been deprived of some of its\r\n     noblest ornaments. Virgil was a native of Mantua; Horace was\r\n     inclined to doubt whether he should call himself an Apulian\r\n     or a Lucanian; it was in Padua that an historian was found\r\n     worthy to record the majestic series of Roman victories. The\r\n     patriot family of the Catos emerged from Tusculum; and the\r\n     little town of Arpinum claimed the double honor of producing\r\n     Marius and Cicero, the former of whom deserved, after\r\n     Romulus and Camillus, to be styled the Third Founder of\r\n     Rome; and the latter, after saving his country from the\r\n     designs of Catiline, enabled her to contend with Athens for\r\n     the palm of eloquence.\r\n\r\n     \"The provinces of the empire (as they have been described in\r\n     the preceding chapter) were destitute of any public force,\r\n     or constitutional freedom. In Etruria, in Greece, and in\r\n     Gaul, it was the first care of the senate to dissolve those\r\n     dangerous confederacies, which taught mankind that, as the\r\n     Roman arms prevailed by division, they might be resisted by\r\n     union. Those princes whom the ostentation of gratitude or\r\n     generosity permitted for a while to hold a precarious\r\n     sceptre were dismissed from their thrones as soon as they\r\n     had performed their appointed task of fashioning to the yoke\r\n     the vanquished nations. The free states and cities which had\r\n     embraced the cause of Rome were rewarded with a nominal\r\n     alliance, and insensibly sunk into real servitude. The\r\n     public authority was everywhere exercised by the ministers\r\n     of the senate and of the emperors, and that authority was\r\n     absolute and without control. But the same salutary maxims\r\n     of government, which had secured the peace and obedience of\r\n     Italy, were extended to the most distant conquests. A\r\n     nation of Romans was gradually formed in the provinces, by\r\n     the double expedient of introducing colonies, and of\r\n     admitting the most faithful and deserving of the provincials\r\n     to the freedom of Rome.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS--THE ATTEMPTED REFORMS OF THE GRACCHI\r\n\r\n    \"Once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide,\r\n    In the strife of Truth with Falsehood, for the good or evil side;\r\n    Some great cause, God's new Messiah, offering each the bloom or blight,\r\n    Parts the goats upon the left hand, and the sheep upon the right,\r\n    And the choice goes by forever 'twixt that darkness and that light.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"Backward look across the ages and the beacon-moments see\r\n    That, like peaks of some sunk continent, jut through Oblivion's sea;\r\n    Not an ear in court or market for the low foreboding cry\r\n    Of those Crises, God's stern winnowers, from whose feet earth's chaff must fly;\r\n    Never shows the choice momentous till the judgment hath passed by.\r\n\r\n    \"Careless seems the great Avenger; history's pages but record\r\n    One death-grapple in the darkness 'twixt old systems and the Word;\r\n    Truth forever on the scaffold, Wrong forever on the throne,--\r\n    Yet that scaffold sways the future, and, behind the dim unknown,\r\n    Standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch above his own.\"\r\n\r\n    --Lowell's _The Present Crisis_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe critical days of any contest are seldom those of its final\r\nculmination. The end has generally been long foreshadowed. The time at\r\nwhich the last stand for the Roman liberties was made was not during\r\nthe civil wars of the last century before Christ, but at the time of\r\nthe attempted reforms of the previous century. The years in which the\r\ngreat crisis of the Roman republic was reached were those from 134 to\r\n121 B.C., the years marked by the activities of the Gracchi.\r\n\r\nThe story of the Gracchi constitutes one of the strangest, grandest,\r\nand saddest stories in the whole course of history. It is a double\r\nstory of sacrifice, suffering, and untiring labor; of temporary\r\nsuccess, of ultimate death and failure--but a failure which stands\r\nforth more glorious in the pages of history than the greatest\r\nsuccesses of others. It is the story of two brothers, possessed of\r\nwealth and of high rank and connections, in the richest and most\r\npowerful country of the world--men to whom was open either an easy\r\npath along the old established road to the highest honors of the Roman\r\nstate or the life of luxurious ease so eagerly embraced by the\r\nmajority of the rich young Romans of that day. Casting aside both\r\nthese choices, and recognizing the dangers of their native state,\r\nthese brothers sacrificed all in an attempt to restore to Rome those\r\nconditions which in the past had built up her greatness, and to secure\r\na redress of those conditions which had made the status of the great\r\nmass of the citizens of the \"Mistress of the World\" hardly superior to\r\nthat of the very serfs. It is a story of the most aggravated\r\nselfishness and relentless hatred on the part of those favored few\r\nwhose special and illegal interests were threatened by the attacks of\r\nthe young reformers. It is also, unfortunately, to too great an extent\r\na story of ingratitude and cowardice on the part of those for whose\r\ninterest Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus sacrificed themselves in vain.\r\n\r\nThe Gracchi were fortunate in having as father one of those Romans\r\nwho still retained the Roman virtues of an earlier age,--patriotism,\r\nbravery, and honor. Not only had the administration of the elder\r\nGracchus of the offices of consul and censor at Rome been free from\r\ncorruption, but his administration of the governorship of the Province\r\nof Ebro had been of great service to his native country and had,\r\nfurthermore, endeared his memory to the Spaniards themselves.\r\n\r\nThe mother of the Gracchi was Cornelia, daughter of Africanus Scipio,\r\nthe greatest Roman hero of the previous generation. Of the twelve sons\r\nand one daughter born of this union, only the daughter and two sons\r\nlived to maturity. The two surviving sons were the first born,\r\nTiberius Sempronius Gracchus, born about 166 B.C., and his brother\r\nGaius, nine years younger.\r\n\r\nFew young Romans were afforded the opportunity of such close relations\r\nand intercourse with the leading men of Rome as was Tiberius Gracchus\r\nin his early years. Even in boyhood his mind seems to have been of a\r\nserious cast, more interested in study and speculation than in the\r\npleasures customary in youth.\r\n\r\nIn his father's house, which was to a large extent a common meeting\r\nplace for all that was best in Roman society, he frequently heard the\r\nleading men of the city lament the disappearance from the country\r\ndistricts of the free citizens, and the attendant evils which seemed\r\nto be hovering over the Roman state. But what to his elders appeared\r\nlamentable principally on account of its effect upon the recruiting of\r\nthe Roman legions, and consequently upon the control of Rome over her\r\nprovinces and her foreign influence, was to young Tiberius an evil of\r\na very different and more serious character. To him alone of this\r\ngroup did this condition appear as a great moral and social wrong--a\r\nwrong, moreover, whose effect would not be limited to the character of\r\nthe soldiers in the Roman army, but which, if not remedied, would,\r\nlike a cancer, eat out the very life of the Roman republic. Another\r\ndifference was that those evils which brought forth from others\r\nlanguid, pessimistic, speculative reflections roused in Tiberius\r\nGracchus the determination to action.\r\n\r\nHardly was the boyhood of Tiberius over when his public life began.\r\n\r\n     \"Scarcely had Tiberius assumed the garb of manhood when he\r\n     was elected into the college of augurs. At the banquet given\r\n     to celebrate his installation, App. Claudius, the chief of\r\n     the senate, offered him his daughter's hand in marriage.\r\n     When the proud senator returned home, he told his wife that\r\n     he had that day betrothed their daughter. 'Ah,' she cried,\r\n     'she is too young; it had been well to wait a while--unless,\r\n     indeed, young Gracchus is the man.' Soon after his marriage\r\n     he accompanied Scipio to Carthage, where he was the first to\r\n     scale the walls.\r\n\r\n     \"The personal importance of Gracchus was strengthened by the\r\n     marriage of Scipio with his only sister. But this marriage\r\n     proved unhappy. Sempronia had no charms of person, and her\r\n     temper was not good; Scipio's austere manners were little\r\n     pleasing to a bride; nor were children born to form a bond\r\n     of union between them.\" (Liddell's _History of Rome_.)\r\n\r\nA brief taste of military life was added to the experience and\r\ntraining of Tiberius Gracchus when he served, while a mere youth, in\r\nthe capture of Carthage.\r\n\r\nHis thirtieth year was spent as a quæstor in Spain. While traveling to\r\nand from this province he was forcibly impressed by the industrial and\r\neconomic conditions in Etruria. Throughout this rich and extensive\r\nterritory the small freeholder seemed to have entirely disappeared,\r\nand the land was now occupied by large estates cultivated by slaves.\r\nTiberius returned to Rome just as the so-called \"slave war\" in Sicily\r\nbroke out. This war not only called attention to the vast number and\r\nthe depths of wretchedness of the slaves already in Italy and the\r\nadjoining island, but it also served to emphasize the perilous\r\ncondition of a state whose foundation rested upon such a smoldering\r\nvolcano.\r\n\r\nIn this servile war the slaves throughout large portions of the island\r\nof Sicily arose in a body, murdered those of their masters who were\r\nnot fortunate enough to escape, and selected a Syrian juggler as their\r\nking. A Greek slave, named Achæus, proved not only a skillful\r\ncommander in the field but also a capable organizer, and he soon\r\nmustered a large army containing both slaves and free laborers.\r\nAnother leader, Cleon, a Sicilian slave, captured the important city\r\nof Agrigentum. The united forces defeated the Roman prætor Lucius\r\nHypsæus, and temporarily drove the Romans out of Sicily.\r\n\r\nIt was not until after three years of continued warfare, after the\r\nRomans had suffered numerous defeats and great armies had been sent\r\nunder three different Roman consuls, that the rebellion in Sicily was\r\nfinally put down.\r\n\r\nUpon his return from Spain, and at the breaking out of the servile\r\nwar, Tiberius Gracchus had not hesitated to freely express his\r\nfeelings as to the cause of the existing evils, and as to the\r\nnecessary remedies for their amelioration, and it was not long before\r\nthat part of the Roman people who were dissatisfied with existing\r\nconditions turned to Gracchus as the only logical leader for the\r\nreform movement. As his views on the cause of the evils and the\r\ngeneral character of the remedies which he proposed had been shown to\r\nthe people by his speeches, Tiberius was elected tribune in 134 B.C.,\r\ntaking office on December 10 of that year.\r\n\r\nThe reforms proposed by Tiberius Gracchus in the bill presented before\r\nthe comitia tributa, almost immediately after his installation as\r\ntribune, were entirely of an economic character. In the field of mere\r\npolitical rights nothing more remained to be asked by the lowest of\r\nthe Roman citizens; their pitiable condition was the result of the\r\nexisting agrarian situation. The agrarian bill proposed by Tiberius\r\nGracchus, while a radical departure from existing conditions, was\r\nneither illegal, confiscatory, nor unjust; it merely provided for a\r\nreassumption on the part of the state of land long held illegally by\r\nthe \"special interests\" of the place and age.\r\n\r\nThe agrarian law of Tiberius Gracchus was in its main features merely\r\na revival of the Licinian agrarian law of 367 B.C. By the original law\r\n(which for more than two centuries had been so flagrantly violated) it\r\nhad been provided that no head of a family should hold more than five\r\nhundred jugera (a jugera being a little more than three fifths of an\r\nacre) of the public land. Tiberius proposed to reënact this law, but\r\nwith the concession added that adult sons might hold each an\r\nadditional two hundred and fifty jugera; but not more than one\r\nthousand jugera, in all, were to be held by any single family. Whoever\r\nwas unlawfully in possession of the public land was required to return\r\nthe same, above the permitted maximum, to the state; fair\r\ncompensation, however, was to be allowed for improvements made by the\r\nholder of the land while it was in his possession.\r\n\r\nThe law further provided that all public lands were to be placed\r\nunder the control of three commissioners. This commission was to allot\r\nthe public land, in small parcels, to such poor citizens as might\r\napply for it. These new occupiers of the land were to hold it in\r\nperpetuity as tenants of the state, paying a small annual rental.\r\nThese estates were to descend to the children of the holders, but were\r\nnot to be alienated, thus preventing the possibility of the land being\r\nonce again gathered together into large estates.\r\n\r\nNo valid objection could be made to the proposals of Tiberius\r\nGracchus, which were merely the righting of one of the worst of the\r\nexisting scandals of the Roman administration; a reform, moreover,\r\nwhich was to be carried out in such a manner as to give to the\r\nwrongdoers far greater consideration than that to which they were\r\nentitled. The law, however, dealt a heavy blow against the richest and\r\nmost powerful class in Rome. The greater Roman capitalists had so long\r\nheld possession, in utter defiance of the law, of the great bulk of\r\nthe public lands of the state that their wrongful possessions had, in\r\ntheir eyes, ripened into a rightfully vested interest.\r\n\r\nAn indirect method of attack has always been used by the opponents of\r\nGracchus, both by the opponents of his own day and by those historians\r\nwho have attempted to assail his memory. A recent historian,\r\nunfriendly both to Gracchus and to his democratic reforms (Ferrero),\r\nrefers to this bill as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"The bill was very favorably received by the peasants and\r\n     the small proprietors. It appears also to have given great\r\n     satisfaction to the clients, freemen, and artisans, who made\r\n     up the proletariat of the metropolis; they fell into the not\r\n     unnatural mistake--often made by the poor before and\r\n     since--of regarding the greed of the rich, and the\r\n     indifference of the government, as a sufficient explanation\r\n     of their own distress.\"\r\n\r\nThe ancient historian Plutarch thus refers to this contest:\r\n\r\n     \"Tiberius defending the matter, which of itself was good and\r\n     just, with such eloquence as might have justified an evil\r\n     cause, was invincible; and no man was able to argue against\r\n     him to confute him, when, speaking in the behalf of the poor\r\n     citizens of Rome (the people being gathered round about the\r\n     pulpit for orations), he told them, that the wild beasts\r\n     through Italy had their dens and caves of abode, and the men\r\n     that fought, and were slain for their country, had nothing\r\n     else but air and light, and so were compelled to wander up\r\n     and down with their wives and children, having no\r\n     resting-place nor house to put their heads in. And that the\r\n     captains do but mock their soldiers when they encourage them\r\n     in battle to fight valiantly for the graves, the temples,\r\n     their own houses, and their predecessors. For, said he, of\r\n     such a number of poor citizens as there be, there cannot a\r\n     man of them show any ancient house or tomb of their\r\n     ancestors, because the poor men go to the wars, and are\r\n     slain for the rich men's pleasures and wealth; besides, they\r\n     falsely call them lords of the earth, where they have not a\r\n     handful of ground that is theirs. These and such other like\r\n     words being uttered before all of the people with such\r\n     vehemency and truth, so moved the common people withal, and\r\n     put them in such a rage, that there was no adversary of his\r\n     able to withstand him. Therefore, leaving to contradict and\r\n     deny the law by argument, the rich men put all their trust\r\n     in Marcus Octavius, colleague and fellow-tribune in office,\r\n     who was a grave and wise young man, and Tiberius' very\r\n     familiar friend. That the first time they came to him, to\r\n     oppose him against the confirmation of this law, he prayed\r\n     them to hold him excused, because Tiberius was his very\r\n     friend. But, in the end, being compelled to it through the\r\n     great number of the rich men that were importunate with him,\r\n     he withstood Tiberius' law, which was enough to overthrow\r\n     it.\"\r\n\r\nA more deep-dyed treachery than that to which Marcus Octavius at\r\nlength consented is, fortunately, but seldom met with in history. It\r\nwas a treachery not only to one of his closest friends, not only to\r\nthe class which he represented and the voters who had elected him, but\r\nalso to the character and traditions of the very office which he held.\r\nThe creation of the office of tribune had been the first great victory\r\nwon by the plebeians; the duties of those holding this office had been\r\nto protect the lives and property, the rights and the liberties, of\r\nthe weaker class in the community--the plebeians.\r\n\r\nTo make it possible for the tribunes to give such protection, the veto\r\nhad been granted to them. From the time when this power had first been\r\nsecured by the tribunes down to the day when the agrarian law of\r\nTiberius Gracchus came before the comitia tributa for its final\r\ndecision, the veto power of the Roman tribune had been the greatest\r\nbulwark of the poor man of Rome. Now, in the greatest crisis of the\r\nlong contest in Roman history of human rights against class\r\nprivileges, this power was to be the weapon by which a traitor was to\r\nsecure the victory of the rich landowners over the great body of the\r\nRoman citizens.\r\n\r\nThe day upon which the bill was to come before the comitia tributa\r\nfound the Forum crowded with what was probably the largest number of\r\ncitizens who, up to this time, had ever attended a meeting of this\r\nassembly. Tiberius Gracchus made his speech in favor of the law, which\r\nspeech was received with great applause. The moment of his great\r\ntriumph was apparently just at hand. The clerk was about to read the\r\nwords of the bill, before it was voted upon, when the renegade tribune\r\nMarcus Octavius stood up and forbade the clerk to read the bill.\r\nGracchus was surprised and, for the time, helpless. After much bitter\r\ndiscussion, the meeting was adjourned; but Gracchus gave notice that\r\nhe would take up his bill again upon the next regular meeting day of\r\nthe comitia tributa.\r\n\r\nThe cowardly treachery of his colleague, instead of discouraging\r\nTiberius Gracchus, merely spurred him on to greater efforts. His\r\npolicy, formerly in the main a conciliatory one, now became militant.\r\nIn retaliation for the veto of Octavius he too made use of this power.\r\nIndeed, a more thorough and effective use of this power than that made\r\nby Gracchus at this time can hardly be imagined. A veto was put upon\r\nthe exercise of any of his functions by any of the Roman officials;\r\neven the treasury was shut up and the courts of justice discontinued.\r\nAs the great landowners had now forfeited all claims to consideration\r\non account of the methods which they had adopted, the compensation\r\nclauses were struck out of the bill, which in its amended form simply\r\nprovided that the state should resume possession of all lands held in\r\ncontravention of the Licinian Law. Even in this amended form there was\r\nnothing revolutionary about the bill; it was merely the reënactment of\r\na law which already existed, and should have been in operation.\r\n\r\nOn the second day when the bill came before the comitia an attempt was\r\nagain made to read the law, and this was again prevented by the veto\r\nof the tribune Octavius. Party feeling by this time ran so high that a\r\nriot seemed inevitable. Trouble was for the time averted by an\r\nagreement to refer the matter to the Senate.\r\n\r\nA few months before, Gracchus' name would have possessed great\r\ninfluence in the Senate, and, furthermore, a number of the\r\nsenators--the most patriotic and clear sighted, who saw the dangers\r\nwith which Rome was confronted--had in the beginning sympathized with\r\nGracchus in the objects which he sought. By this time, however,\r\nGracchus had lost all the sympathy and support which he had ever\r\npossessed in this direction. This is sometimes explained by saying\r\nthat Tiberius Gracchus had alienated all the conservative elements in\r\nhis support by the intemperance of his actions. Such an explanation\r\ncannot stand the scrutiny of history. The proposals and objects of\r\nGracchus were never anything but moderate--never anything more than\r\nthe claim that the existing laws must be enforced. The methods of\r\nGracchus were not only strictly legal but also strictly conventional\r\nand usual, until the disgraceful tactics of his opponents constrained\r\nhim to more forcible action.\r\n\r\nAt this time Tiberius Gracchus, meeting only reproaches from the\r\nsenators, who were enraged at him because he had called attention to\r\nand made an issue of a state of political corruption from which their\r\nclass had benefited for generations, returned to the comitia. Upon his\r\nreturn the meeting was again dissolved; but before it had adjourned\r\nGracchus gave notice that he would still again bring up his measure\r\nbefore the comitia tributa, on its next regular meeting day, and that\r\nif Marcus Octavius again interposed the veto power to prevent a vote\r\nbeing taken upon the bill, he would move the people that Octavius be\r\ndeposed as tribune.\r\n\r\nBefore the day for the next meeting of the comitia tributa arrived,\r\nGracchus appears to have made every effort to induce his colleague and\r\nformer friend to recede from his position. All efforts in this\r\ndirection, however, proving ineffectual, Gracchus immediately upon the\r\nassembling of the comitia moved that the tribune Marcus Octavius be\r\nremoved from office. Of the first seventeen tribes to vote, each, by a\r\nunanimous or practically unanimous vote, was in favor of the\r\ndeposition of Octavius. Before the vote of the eighteenth tribe was\r\ntaken, Gracchus made a final appeal to Octavius to withdraw his\r\nopposition. After some hesitation Octavius refused, and the vote of\r\nthe next tribe furnished the required majority for his deposition.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in a popular government the principle of the right\r\nof the people to recall an unworthy public official had been put into\r\npractical operation. A more fitting occasion for this action can\r\nhardly be imagined.\r\n\r\nThe action of Tiberius Gracchus in adopting this innovation has been\r\nbitterly denounced, and as strongly defended. One of the liberal\r\nhistorians refers to this action as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"These acts of Tiberius Gracchus are commonly said to have\r\n     been the beginning of revolution at Rome; and the guilt of\r\n     it is accordingly laid at his door. And there can be no\r\n     doubt that he was guilty in the sense that a man is guilty\r\n     who introduces a light into some chamber filled with\r\n     explosive vapour, which the stupidity or malice of others\r\n     has suffered to accumulate. But, after all, too much is made\r\n     of this violation of constitutional forms and the sanctity\r\n     of the tribunate. The first were effete, and all regular\r\n     means of renovating the republic seemed to be closed to the\r\n     despairing patriot, by stolid obstinacy sheltering itself\r\n     under the garb of law and order. The second was no longer\r\n     what it had been--the recognised refuge and defence of the\r\n     poor. The rich, as Tiberius in effect argued, had found out\r\n     how to use it also. If all men who set the example of\r\n     forcible infringement of law are criminals, Gracchus was a\r\n     criminal. But in the world's annals he sins in good company;\r\n     and when men condemn him, they should condemn Washington\r\n     also. Perhaps his failure has had most to do with his\r\n     condemnation. But if ever a revolution was excusable this\r\n     was; for it was carried not by a small party for small\r\n     aims, but by national acclamations, by the voices of\r\n     Italians who flocked to Rome to vote. How far Gracchus saw\r\n     the inevitable effects of his acts is open to dispute. But\r\n     probably he saw it as clearly as any man can see the future.\r\n     Because he was generous and enthusiastic, it is assumed that\r\n     he was sentimental and weak, and that his policy was guided\r\n     by impulse rather than reason. There seems little to sustain\r\n     such a judgment other than the desire of writers to\r\n     emphasise a comparison between him and his brother.\" (A. H.\r\n     Beesly, in _The Gracchi, Marius and Sulla_.)\r\n\r\nThe procedure adopted by Gracchus on this occasion was unknown to the\r\nlaw, but it is hard to say that it was against the law. If this action\r\nwas unconstitutional, and revolutionary, so had been every change\r\nwhich had ever been made in the fundamental principles of Roman public\r\nlaw. The truth of the matter was that Rome had neither a written\r\nconstitution nor any law governing the method by which its fundamental\r\nlaw might be changed. Rome, in this respect, was constantly in a\r\nposition similar to that in which the state of Rhode Island found\r\nherself in 1841. The old colonial charter, which after the separation\r\nfrom England had been continued in force as a state constitution, was\r\nno longer suitable for existing conditions, and there was a general\r\nfeeling among the inhabitants of the state that the old charter must\r\ngive way to a new state constitution. A difficulty, however, here\r\npresented itself in the fact that the old colonial charter, having\r\nbeen granted by royal authority, contained no provision as to its\r\namendment by act of the people. In this situation the people of the\r\nstate were compelled to go outside of their organic law, and,\r\ndisregarding the old charter, to adopt a new constitution and form of\r\ngovernment. All this was not accomplished, however, without much\r\nconfusion and an incipient civil war.\r\n\r\nSimilarly situated, Tiberius Gracchus was now obliged to go beyond the\r\nletter of the existing law, and to vindicate the underlying principle\r\nof Roman law that the duty of the tribune was the protection of the\r\nrights of the people, by introducing a new political expedient into\r\nthe scheme of Roman government.\r\n\r\nUpon the deposition of Octavius the agrarian law of Gracchus was\r\nimmediately passed by acclamation. Three commissioners were appointed\r\nto carry out the provisions of the bill--Tiberius Gracchus, his\r\nbrother Gaius, and Appius Claudius, the father-in-law of Tiberius\r\nGracchus.\r\n\r\nFor a time the success and popularity of Gracchus was at its zenith;\r\nthe commissioners, appointed to allot the land, energetically\r\nprosecuted the work, and the great landowners became more and more\r\nbitter as they saw their illegal gains about to be wrested from them.\r\n\r\nOne difficulty in the carrying out of the agrarian law was due to the\r\nfact that the poverty of the mass of the Roman citizens was such that\r\nvery few who desired to secure an allotment of land were possessed of,\r\nor could secure, the necessary money to stock the new farms and to\r\nerect the necessary buildings. When, therefore, at this crisis, it was\r\nlearned that Attalus Philometor, the recently deceased king of\r\nPergamus, in Asia Minor, had made the Roman people his heirs,\r\nbequeathing to them both his kingdom and all his private lands and\r\ntreasures, Gracchus grasped at this opportunity to overcome the\r\ndifficulty experienced by the agrarian commission. He proposed a law\r\nproviding that all the money so received should be used to furnish\r\nthe necessary stock for those to whom the public land was assigned.\r\nAbout the same time another law was enacted, apparently not proposed\r\nby Tiberius Gracchus, providing that the Agrarian Commission (called\r\nthe triumviri) should have final jurisdiction in all controversies\r\nover the question as to whether any particular piece of land was\r\npublic or private land. The capitalistic party, setting an example\r\nwhich has been so often followed in our own country and in our own\r\nday, now attempted to divert the issue from the reforms being put into\r\noperation through the energy of Gracchus, by personal attacks upon the\r\ntribune himself; he was accused of having received a purple robe and\r\ndiadem from the envoy of the late king of Pergamus; of having violated\r\nthe Roman constitution; of desiring to make himself king over Rome.\r\nOnly vindictive partisanship could find any basis upon which to allege\r\nthe truth of any of these charges except perhaps that of a technical\r\nviolation of the Roman constitution in the deposition of Octavius. The\r\nextreme party in the Senate, led by Publius Scipio Nasica, were openly\r\nplotting the death of Tiberius Gracchus, either by assassination or\r\nby judicial proceedings, as soon as his term of office should expire.\r\n\r\nThe violent position taken by his opponents clearly showed to Tiberius\r\nGracchus that both his reforms and his life were in danger. It was\r\nevident that neither the agrarian reforms nor the life of Gracchus\r\nwould be safe after he had ceased to hold the office of tribune, and\r\nthe course of events finally drove Tiberius into becoming a candidate\r\nfor reëlection. To strengthen his hold upon the people he prepared\r\nthree new laws. The first law diminished the required period of\r\nmilitary service; the second law changed the procedure in the higher\r\ncourts of law, and permitted the jurors to be selected from all\r\npersons possessing a certain amount of property, instead of (as\r\npreviously) restricting the selection to members of the Senate; the\r\nthird law created the right of appeal from the courts of law to the\r\nassembly of the people in all cases.\r\n\r\nThe scenes at the election in June, 133 B.C., when Tiberius Gracchus\r\nfor the second time came before the comitia tributa as a candidate for\r\nelection as tribune, were among the most tumultuous in all Roman\r\npolitical history. Upon the first day of voting the first tribe gave\r\nits vote for the reëlection of Tiberius Gracchus; upon this, his\r\nopponents immediately raised a protest, declaring that no one could be\r\ntwice, in succession, elected to the office of tribune. The debate on\r\nthis question developed into such a tumult that any further business\r\nbecame an impossibility, and the meeting was adjourned until the next\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe friends of Tiberius were now thoroughly alarmed for his safety. A\r\nlarge throng accompanied him to his home, and kept watch before his\r\ndoors all night. Before going to the comitia tributa in the morning\r\nTiberius is reported to have told his friends that if he considered\r\nhimself in danger, during the day's proceedings, and thought it\r\nnecessary for his friends to repel force by force, he would raise his\r\nhand to his head. No means seems to have been adopted, however, for\r\nany concerted or effectual resistance, and none of his friends who\r\nattended the meeting of the comitia tributa went armed.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the second meeting of the comitia tributa the Senate\r\nalso met close by in the temple of Faith. Nasica demanded of the\r\nconsul Scævola, who presided, to take steps to prevent the reëlection\r\nof Tiberius Gracchus. The consul refused to interfere. At this stage\r\none of the senators, Fulvius Flaccus, who was friendly to Tiberius,\r\nhastened from the temple to inform him that his death was about to be\r\nresolved upon by the Senate. Upon hearing this news the friends of\r\nGracchus began hastily to arm themselves with staves, for the\r\nprotection of their leader, and Gracchus gave the agreed signal by\r\nraising his hand to his head.\r\n\r\nSeizing every opportunity to attack the motives of Gracchus, his\r\nopponents raised the cry that he was asking for a crown, and this\r\nreport was carried into the Senate. Nasica, the bitterest of the\r\nenemies of Gracchus and of his reforms, shouted, \"The consul is\r\nbetraying the republic! Those who would save their country, follow\r\nme!\" and rushed out from the meeting of the Senate. He was followed by\r\nmany of the senators, and by their slaves and adherents, those who\r\nwere not already armed breaking up the benches to make clubs for\r\nthemselves. The followers of Gracchus, without any organization among\r\nthemselves, were unable to offer effectual resistance to the attack,\r\nand soon fled in all directions. Tiberius Gracchus attempted to take\r\nrefuge in the temple of Jupiter, but the priests closed the doors\r\nagainst him, and, stumbling over a bench, he was killed by repeated\r\nblows on the head before he could rise. In this riot more than three\r\nhundred of the followers of Gracchus were killed by clubs, or by being\r\ndriven over the wall at the edge of the Tarpeian rock. The hatred\r\ntoward Tiberius Gracchus, on the part of the special interests of the\r\ntime, did not end with his murder. Gaius Gracchus was refused\r\npermission, which he sought, to bury his brother, and it was decreed\r\nby the Senate that the bodies of Tiberius Gracchus and his followers\r\nshould be thrown into the Tiber before daybreak on the following\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nVery divergent views have been taken of the conduct of Tiberius\r\nGracchus and that of his opponents by different classes of historians.\r\nHistorians, equally with politicians, inevitably fall into one of the\r\ntwo classes into which mankind is divided, the class of the radicals\r\non the one hand, or of the conservatives on the other; into the class\r\nof those who favor progress and the recognition of the supreme right\r\nof manhood, or into the class of those who wish to keep things as they\r\nare, and worship before the shrine of vested interests. No single\r\nincident in history better serves to bring out the bias of the\r\nhistorian than does that of the efforts of Tiberius Gracchus in behalf\r\nof his agrarian law. No historian can write this page of Roman history\r\nwithout throwing open for the inspection of the world the inmost\r\nworkings of his mind and sympathies. That class of historians who can\r\nsee more pathos in the execution of King Louis XVI than in the\r\ncombined misery of the downtrodden millions who lived and died in\r\nFrance under the two centuries of Bourbon misrule, have attempted to\r\ncast upon Tiberius Gracchus the stigma of a demagogue, of a reckless\r\nleader, of a violator of his country's most fundamental laws; while\r\nthe conduct of the leaders of the conservative party, who did not\r\nhesitate at the crisis to resort even to murder rather than surrender\r\ntheir unlawful profits, is excused as being rendered necessary by the\r\nviolence of Tiberius Gracchus.\r\n\r\nYet there are few prominent characters in whose public actions the\r\nimpartial critic can find so little to criticize as in that of the\r\ngreatest of all Roman tribunes--Tiberius Gracchus. At the outset the\r\nwhole policy of Gracchus was moderate and even conciliatory, and it\r\nwas only the unyielding selfishness of the great landowners which\r\nforced him into a position where he must either surrender all for\r\nwhich he was fighting or adopt a more vigorous plan of campaign;\r\nwhich, finally, against his will, compelled him to adopt those tactics\r\nfor which he has been so severely censured by certain historians.\r\n\r\nThe legality of the deposition of Octavius has already been discussed.\r\nIt only remains to consider the action of Tiberius Gracchus in\r\npresenting himself as a candidate for reëlection as tribune. Of the\r\nvital necessity for this action, both to secure the enforcement of the\r\nagrarian law and the personal safety of Tiberius himself, there can be\r\nno doubt. It must be admitted, however, that this by itself is not a\r\nsufficient defense of the action of Gracchus on this occasion. The\r\nfundamental principles of government in any country cannot, generally,\r\nbe safely violated merely to meet a temporary exigency. The worst\r\npossible government is generally better, for those who are to live\r\nunder it, than anarchy; and the condition of a country where laws can\r\nbe habitually broken with impunity is but one step from that of a\r\ncountry where no laws exist. The breaking of a law with good motives\r\nis often more disastrous than the breaking of it with bad intentions;\r\nbecause in a former case an example is set which, being looked upon\r\nwith approval by a large class of the best people in the community, is\r\napt to furnish a precedent for future violations of the law, with the\r\nworst motives and for the most dangerous purposes. No true republic\r\ncan long continue to exist unless a sense of reverence for and\r\nobedience to law is bred into the mass of its citizens. The right of\r\noverthrowing a corrupt government and of establishing a new civic\r\nsystem must ever reside with the people; but such a right must be\r\nresorted to only as an extreme, exceptional, and desperate remedy, and\r\nthe frequent recurrence of revolutions and rebellions in a republic\r\nresults in a substitution of the rule of force for the peaceful rule\r\nof the majority, and is inconsistent with any true idea of democracy.\r\n\r\nIf, then, Tiberius Gracchus had attempted to override the fundamental\r\nlaw of Rome for the purpose of obtaining some temporary personal or\r\npartisan advantage he might well have deserved the attacks which have\r\nbeen made upon his memory. Tiberius Gracchus, however, violated no\r\nprovision of the Roman constitution. No evidence exists that there was\r\never any law making a Roman tribune ineligible for reëlection.\r\n\r\nThe prohibition would seem to have arisen from long-continued custom\r\nrather than from law, and to have been of a character not unsimilar to\r\nthe so-called \"conventions of the English Constitution,\" or to the\r\nrule in this country that no man shall be elected for a third term as\r\nPresident. If a law declaring a tribune to be ineligible for\r\nreëlection was ever enacted in Rome (and with the absence of a full\r\nlist of Roman laws this is a point on which absolute certainty is\r\nimpossible) it was, in all probability, of a directory rather than a\r\nmandatory character. Such was the character of all Roman laws relative\r\nto the qualification of officers. Thus, the Roman laws provided a\r\nregular order in which the principal offices at Rome should be held,\r\nand prohibited any person holding any office until he had held all\r\nthose named before it on the list, and until he had reached a certain\r\nspecified age.\r\n\r\nThis law, while in the main followed, was frequently disregarded. The\r\nviolations were in the main chargeable to the very class at Rome that\r\nwas most bitter in the denunciation of Tiberius Gracchus for offering\r\nhimself as a candidate for reëlection as tribune. Under the existing\r\npolitical conditions at Rome no great blame could be attached to an\r\noccasional disregard either of the law regulating the qualifications\r\nfor office or the law, or custom, relative to the reëlection of a\r\ntribune. It is only on this one occasion in Roman history that the\r\nviolation of either of these laws was denounced as an attack on the\r\nRoman constitution. Even in the exciting days preceding the passage of\r\nthe Licinian Laws the tribunes Licinius and Sextius were reëlected\r\nyear after year, without the legality of their election being\r\nquestioned. Only ten years after the death of Tiberius Gracchus the\r\nreëlection to the office of tribune of his brother, Gaius Gracchus,\r\nwas permitted. It is a striking comment upon the fairness of some of\r\nthe historians who attack Tiberius Gracchus for his alleged violation\r\nof the law that they are able to find excuses for the action of that\r\nbranch of the senatorial party whose members were so unwilling to\r\nsurrender to the state their illegal profits that they resorted to\r\nforce to break up a meeting of the comitia tributa and to murder\r\nGracchus and three hundred of his adherents.\r\n\r\nThe years which intervened between the tribuneship of Tiberius\r\nGracchus and that of his brother Gaius were filled with internal\r\nfactional discord at Rome, but without any decisive results. Each\r\nparty, in turn, was able to secure revenge upon its opponents, in the\r\nconflict connected with the death of Tiberius Gracchus. First, the\r\npopular party was successful in compelling Nasica to retire from\r\nItaly. Next, in 132 B.C., the Senate gave to the consuls a commission\r\nto inquire into the actions of those who had supported Tiberius\r\nGracchus. By means of this commission the aristocratic party was\r\nenabled to bring about the execution of some of the partisans of\r\nGracchus and the exile of others.\r\n\r\nFor the time the leadership of the popular party had passed to C.\r\nPapirius Carbo, a man possessed both of the ability and the vices of\r\nthe successful demagogue. He was one of those politicians who are\r\nalways to be found in the forefront of every movement for liberty or\r\nreform, and who, by their hypocrisy and selfishness, do more to bring\r\ndiscredit upon the principles they champion than can possibly be done\r\nby the ablest of the opponents of such principles. No greater contrast\r\ncan be imagined than is to be found in a comparison between Tiberius\r\nGracchus and Carbo. In the case of the former we see a devotion to\r\nprinciple and to humanity which not even the fear of death could\r\nalter; in the case of Carbo, on the contrary, we can discover nothing\r\nbut a striving for selfish ends and personal advancement. He appeared\r\nas a radical among radicals when this attitude seemed to offer the\r\nshortest road to fame and fortune; and with equal facility he became\r\nthe most abject tool of the senatorial party when such a change of\r\nposition seemed most likely to result to his personal benefit.\r\n\r\nBeing elected a tribune, Carbo set himself to win the favor of the\r\npeople by new popular legislation. He introduced and secured the\r\npassage of a bill extending the use of the ballot into the legislative\r\nassemblies of the people. His next measure, one to formally authorize\r\nthe reëlection of tribunes, was defeated. Gaius Gracchus made his\r\nfirst public speech in support of this measure.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Agrarian Commission, in the meantime, had been\r\nprogressing in spite of the murder of Tiberius Gracchus and the\r\nobstacles which the great landowners were constantly throwing in the\r\nway of the commission. The Roman census shows that in the six years\r\nfrom 131 to 125 B.C. the number of burgesses was increased by\r\nseventy-six thousand; this increase was almost entirely due to the\r\noperation of the agrarian law, and the work of the commission.\r\n\r\nThe vacancy in the Agrarian Commission made by the murder of Tiberius\r\nGracchus had been first filled by the election of P. Licinius Crassus,\r\nfather-in-law of Gaius Gracchus. Upon the death of Crassus, and of\r\nAppius Claudius a few years later, these commissioners were succeeded\r\nby Carbo and Fulvius Flaccus, the latter being the senator who had\r\nattempted to warn Tiberius Gracchus of his danger, on the day of his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nCarbo, for the time the guiding spirit of the commission, attempted to\r\nwin additional popularity by a vigorous policy in carrying out the\r\nagrarian law. Energetic action along this line was undoubtedly needed,\r\nas the great landowners had in many ways succeeded in blocking the\r\nwork of the commission. The policy of Carbo, however, was that of the\r\ndemagogue rather than that of the statesman, and the result of the\r\nmethods which he adopted was a reaction which, for a time, completely\r\nput a stop to the work of the commission, split the popular party, and\r\ncreated a new political party or faction whose existence had an\r\nimportant influence upon the course of Roman political history during\r\nthe next two generations.\r\n\r\nThe first step taken by Carbo was the publication of a proclamation\r\ncalling for information against owners of public land who had not\r\nvoluntarily registered themselves as such. In theory such a proceeding\r\nwas undoubtedly a proper mode of procedure against the large holders\r\nof public lands who were endeavoring to evade the agrarian law; but in\r\npractice it resulted in a great deal of hardship. Many of the good\r\nland titles throughout all Italy were without sufficient documentary\r\nproof; and many landowners, whose land was private, were yet at a loss\r\nfor evidence to prove that their land was of this character when\r\ninformation against them was filed with the commission.\r\n\r\nThe situation was a most delicate one, and one requiring the exercise\r\nof the highest degree of honesty, tact, good judgment, and diligence.\r\nNone of these qualities was possessed by Carbo. The commission acted\r\nin the most arbitrary manner and apparently declared a great deal of\r\nprivate land to belong to the public. The injustice seems to have been\r\npracticed not so much against the great landowners (Carbo appears even\r\nas early as this to have been falling under the influence of the\r\naristocratic party) as against the small Latin and Italian landowners.\r\nThe result was that the Latins and Italians, who had been among the\r\ntruest of the adherents of Tiberius Gracchus, now became alienated\r\nfrom the Roman popular party under the leadership of Carbo, and began\r\nto come under the influence of the senatorial party.\r\n\r\nPolitics made strange bedfellows two thousand years ago as well as\r\nnow, and the new turn of the wheel of Roman politics brought in\r\nScipio Africanus as the head of the Latins and Italians, and working\r\nin harmony with the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe first action taken by Scipio was to introduce and secure the\r\npassage of a law taking away from the Agrarian Commission the judicial\r\npower by which it was enabled to decide questions as to the public or\r\nprivate character of lands and vesting such power in the consuls. This\r\njudicial power was then vested in the consul C. Sempronius Tuditanus;\r\nbut he being soon sent to Illyria to conduct a military campaign\r\nagainst the Iapydes, no person was left in Rome with the power to\r\nsettle questions of this character. The work of the Agrarian\r\nCommission was now brought to a stop, and no further reassumption or\r\nallotting of public lands could take place. Thus the great landowners\r\nwere finally successful in destroying the effect of the agrarian\r\nlegislation of Tiberius Gracchus.\r\n\r\nAs this result began to make itself manifest, so great criticism arose\r\nagainst the action of Scipio that he felt called upon to announce that\r\nhe would explain and defend his actions both before the Senate and\r\nbefore the people. In his speech before the Senate he carefully\r\nevaded all reference to the case of the great landowners who still\r\ncontinued illegally to hold large tracts of the public lands, and\r\nproclaimed his purpose to be to protect the Latin and Italian farmers\r\nwhose small holdings of land were being wrongfully taken from them by\r\nthe actions of the Agrarian Commission. These small farmers, sympathy\r\nfor whom Scipio thus attempted to arouse, thus occupied the position\r\nheld by those widows and orphans who to-day appear so prominently\r\namong the stockholders of all law-breaking corporations.\r\n\r\nThe speech of Scipio was naturally well received in the Senate; what\r\nits reception would have been on the second day, before the people in\r\nthe Forum, is problematical. On the morning following his speech in\r\nthe Senate Scipio was found dead in his bed. It is one of the unsolved\r\nmysteries of history whether Scipio died from natural causes or was\r\nmurdered. Nor is it more certain, if he was murdered, as to who his\r\nmurderers were. Strong suspicion was directed against Carbo, and that\r\nhypocritical demagogue was driven into a temporary political\r\nretirement, from which he emerged a few years later as one of the\r\nmost serviceable tools of the senatorial party.\r\n\r\nThe importance, ability, and character of Scipio Africanus have been\r\ngreatly over-praised by most historians. A. H. Beesly, however, in his\r\nwork _The Gracchi, Marius and Sulla_, gives a discriminating criticism\r\nof this Roman general and statesman:\r\n\r\n     \"He is usually extolled as a patriot who would not stir to\r\n     humour a Roman rabble, but who, when downtrodden honest\r\n     farmers, his comrades in the wars, appealed to him, at once\r\n     stepped into the arena as their champion. In reality he was\r\n     a reactionist who, when the inevitable results of those\r\n     liberal ideas which had been broached in his own circle\r\n     stared him in the face, seized the first available means of\r\n     stifling them. The world had moved too fast for him. As\r\n     censor, instead of beseeching the gods to increase the glory\r\n     of the State, he begged them to preserve it. Brave as a man,\r\n     he was a pusillanimous statesman. It was well for his\r\n     reputation that he died just then. Without Sulla's personal\r\n     vices he might have played Sulla's part as a politician, and\r\n     his atrocities in Spain as well as his remark on the death\r\n     of Tiberius Gracchus--words breathing the very essence of a\r\n     narrow swordsman's nature--showed that from bloodshed at all\r\n     events he would not have shrunk. It is hard to respect such\r\n     a man in spite of all his good qualities. Fortune gave him\r\n     the opportunity of playing a great part, and he shrank from\r\n     it. When the crop sprang up which he had himself helped to\r\n     sow, he blighted it. But because he was personally\r\n     respectable, and because he held a middle course between\r\n     contemporary parties, he has found favour with historians,\r\n     who are too apt to forget that there is in politics, as in\r\n     other things, a right course and a wrong, and that to\r\n     attempt to walk along both at once proves a man to be a weak\r\n     statesman, and does not prove him to be a great or good\r\n     man.\"\r\n\r\nThe fillers in, who had occupied the stage of Roman politics for the\r\nyears following the murder of Tiberius Gracchus, were now removed, and\r\nthe stage was being rapidly set for the second and final act of the\r\ngreat historical tragedy of the Gracchi.\r\n\r\nThe political problems which confronted Rome at the time of the death\r\nof Scipio rapidly reached such an acute state that it became evident\r\nthe solution of these problems, and the preservation of the Roman\r\nrepublic, must be the work of a Man, not of a manikin or a demagogue.\r\nAt this crisis Rome was blessed with the best of fortune, only to be\r\nimmediately thereafter cursed with the worst of misfortune. The good\r\nfortune consisted in the fact that at this time the man presented\r\nhimself for the work; the bad fortune arose from the refusal of Rome\r\nto avail herself of his work.\r\n\r\nThe agitation of Carbo had added to the bitter contest between rich\r\nand poor, and one perhaps still more bitter, at least temporarily,\r\nbetween Romans and Italians. An attempt was made to reconcile the\r\ndifferences between the Romans and Italians by means of a compromise,\r\nby the terms of which the Italians were to consent to the carrying out\r\nof the Agrarian Law, and in return were to be admitted to Roman\r\ncitizenship. This last proposal was viewed with great alarm by the\r\nRoman proletariat, most of whom were by this time possessed of nothing\r\nin the world except the rights and privileges of Roman citizenship,\r\nand who saw that the value of such rights and privileges would be\r\ngreatly diminished by the great increase now proposed in the number of\r\nthose by whom such rights and privileges were to be enjoyed.\r\n\r\nThe Italians, on their side, delighted at the prospect of obtaining\r\nthese rights, began to come to Rome in great numbers. This migration\r\nadded fuel to the flame, and in 126 B.C. the tribune, Junius Pennus,\r\nproposed an alien act by which foreigners were compelled to leave\r\nRome. The law was passed, with unpleasant consequences at a later\r\ndate. For the second time in his life Gaius Gracchus made a public\r\nspeech, on this occasion appearing on the losing side.\r\n\r\nThe following year Gaius Gracchus served as quæstor and was sent to\r\nSardinia under the consul Aurelius Orestes. The Senate, and the\r\noligarchical party in general, had by this time come to regard the\r\nyoung Gaius Gracchus with mingled fear and suspicion, and in disregard\r\nof the laws he was first ordered to remain a second year in Sardinia,\r\nand later to remain a third year.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, at Rome, events had been moving rapidly. Fulvius\r\nFlaccus, the old friend of Tiberius Gracchus, had been elected consul\r\nand had brought in a bill extending the franchise to all the Latin and\r\nItalian allies. Shortly thereafter, before the bill had been voted\r\nupon, Flaccus had been sent by the Senate upon foreign service, and\r\nthe bill was sidetracked. The disappointment at such a result on the\r\npart of those who were denied the right of suffrage, after they had\r\nbelieved it won, culminated in the rebellion of the Latin city of\r\nFregellæ. The force with which the city was reduced to submission, and\r\nthe severity with which the outbreak was punished, destroyed any\r\nfurther thought on the part of the Latins and Italians of attempting\r\nto secure their rights by force, but increased the silent discontent\r\nof these people.\r\n\r\nIt was with these conditions existing at Rome that Gaius Gracchus\r\nreturned to the city after two and one-half years' absence in\r\nSardinia, defying the Senate by disobeying its order to finish out his\r\nthird year in the island.\r\n\r\nThe censors were in office at the time of the return of Gaius Gracchus\r\nto Rome, and his enemies succeeded in having him summoned before them\r\nimmediately to answer for his alleged misconduct in leaving the post\r\nto which he had been assigned by the Senate. It was hoped that the\r\ncensors could be induced to denounce him, which action would have\r\nrendered him ineligible to hold public office. Gracchus, however, so\r\nstrongly defended himself in a speech to the people that the censors\r\ndid not dare take any action against him. In his speech he relied on\r\nthe well-established principle of the Roman law at that time, that the\r\nSenate had no authority to compel him to serve as quæstor for a longer\r\nperiod than one year. As to his own conduct in the exercise of the\r\noffice of quæstor he said, \"No one can say that I have received a\r\npenny in presents, or have put any one to charges on my own account.\r\nThe purse which I took out full I have brought back empty; though I\r\ncould name persons who took out casks filled with wine and brought\r\nthem home charged with money.\"\r\n\r\nUpon his acquittal Gaius Gracchus became a candidate for the office of\r\ntribune, and was elected, in spite of the most strenuous opposition of\r\nthe senatorial party and of the great landowners. However, the\r\nopposition to him was so strong that, in the number of votes received,\r\nhe stood only fourth in the list of successful candidates.\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon the work of Gaius Gracchus as Roman tribune it is\r\nadmissible to stop for a moment to compare the characters, natures,\r\nand abilities of Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus. The general judgment of\r\nhistory seems to assign a far higher place to Gaius Gracchus than to\r\nhis elder brother. How far such a view is correct is certainly\r\nquestionable. It is a view based largely upon the longer term of\r\noffice, the more spectacular reforms, and the more dramatic death of\r\nthe younger brother. Without detracting in any degree from the high\r\ncharacter and motives, and the wonderful ability, of Gaius Gracchus,\r\nit may still be said that the higher niche in the temple of history\r\nmore properly belongs to Tiberius.\r\n\r\nTo Tiberius belongs that special honor which properly attaches itself\r\nto the pioneer; perhaps, most of all, to the pioneer in the field of\r\npolitical, social, or economic reforms. In the case of Tiberius, his\r\ncareer was deliberately entered upon, as the result of his profound\r\nstudy and keen observation, acting upon his naturally strong Roman\r\npatriotism, hatred of wrong and oppression, and sympathy for humanity.\r\nWhether the career of Gaius would have taken the direction which it\r\ndid but for the memory and influence of his brother, is problematical.\r\nIt is certain that the strongest motive which urged him onward in his\r\ncareer as tribune was the all-mastering desire and determination to\r\navenge the murder of his brother, and to vindicate his memory by\r\ncarrying his measures through to a triumphant conclusion. It might\r\nalmost be said that the mainspring of the career of Tiberius was his\r\nlove for Rome, while the mainspring of the career of Gaius was his\r\nlove for his brother.\r\n\r\nTiberius Gracchus was the greater statesman; Gaius Gracchus the better\r\npolitician. Tiberius could see more clearly the great outlines of what\r\nlay at a distance; Gaius could discern more exactly the details of\r\nwhat was close at hand. If the political activities of the two\r\nbrothers could have been at the same time, each would have\r\nsupplemented the other, and it is possible that their combined efforts\r\nmight have been sufficient to secure the accomplishment of their\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nIn many respects Gaius Gracchus surpassed his brother in ability. The\r\nyounger brother is generally conceded to have been the greatest orator\r\nwho, up to that time, had ever lived in Rome; while Cicero, unfriendly\r\nboth to Gaius Gracchus personally and to his measures, lamented his\r\nearly death as a loss to Roman literature. It is also probable that\r\nGaius was superior to his brother in executive ability and in his\r\nwonderful capacity for hard work. Against that must be set the greater\r\nvision displayed by Tiberius Gracchus, in the character and details of\r\nhis proposed reforms. There was nothing in the measure proposed by the\r\nelder Gracchus which conflicts with either justice, the soundest\r\nprinciples of statesmanship, or of political economy; nor was there\r\nany feature which seemed to have been inserted in those measures\r\nmerely as a bid for popularity or for votes.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, as much cannot be said for the reforms of Gaius\r\nGracchus; some of the provisions of the laws which he proposed were\r\nunsound in theory and dangerous in practice, and were probably brought\r\nforward merely as a bid for popularity. Provisions of this character\r\nwere not numerous enough, or important enough, to detract from the\r\ngeneral merit of the reforms proposed by Gaius Gracchus, but their\r\npresence in his bills would seem to indicate on his part a less\r\ncomprehensive grasp of political principles than that possessed by his\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nIt is a striking illustration of the irony which fate sometimes makes\r\nuse of, that the only part of the measures brought forward by the\r\nGracchi which were permitted to have a permanent influence upon Roman\r\nlife and history were the questionable measures of Gaius Gracchus.\r\n\r\nIn their temperaments Tiberius appears the calmer, Gaius possessing\r\nthe more fiery disposition. Tiberius, throughout his career, continued\r\nto exercise the highest degree of control over both his feelings and\r\nhis actions. While fighting for principles which he believed essential\r\nto the safety and welfare of Rome he manifested surprisingly little\r\nanimosity toward his opponents. Even in the deposition of Octavius he\r\nseems to have been free from personal malice, as is indicated by his\r\nattempt to secure a reconciliation with his brother tribune after\r\nseventeen out of the necessary eighteen tribunes had voted in favor of\r\nthe deposition of the latter.\r\n\r\nGaius, embittered by the murder of his brother Tiberius, developed a\r\nhatred toward his opponents which time never healed. Patience and\r\njudgment led him to bide his time and prepare for the contest which he\r\nconsidered as fated, and for the revenge upon which he was\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nHis character might be fitly described in the words of Thomas Moore as\r\none of those\r\n\r\n    \"Spirits of fire, that brood not long,\r\n      But flash resentment back for wrong;\r\n    And hearts where, slow but deep, the seeds\r\n      Of vengeance ripen into deeds.\"\r\n\r\nThe desire to avenge the death of his brother was indeed the central\r\nidea of Gaius Gracchus throughout his whole political career. It is\r\nwhen we look at his work from this viewpoint that much which appears\r\ncontradictory or obscure becomes easy to appreciate and understand.\r\n\r\nOne of the first steps taken by Gaius Gracchus in the reform campaign\r\nundertaken by him was an attempt to divide the ranks of those who had\r\nopposed his brother. The oligarchical party had for many generations\r\nbeen composed of two different elements united for mutual protection,\r\nbut whose interests, in many respects, were mutually antagonistic. The\r\nobject of Gracchus was to break the political union between the two\r\nfactions by arousing the points of antagonism.\r\n\r\nThe two elements in the aristocratic party above referred to were the\r\nsenatorial families and the wealthy mercantile interests. The general\r\nline of demarcation between the two classes was the distinction\r\nbetween the aristocracy of money and the aristocracy of birth,\r\ngenerally to be found wherever aristocracies exist. The senators, with\r\nfew exceptions, were recruited from the old families which had been\r\nprominent in Rome for generations and even for centuries. The majority\r\nof the members were of patrician descent, but the distinction between\r\npatrician and plebeian was now of little, or no, practical importance.\r\nSome of the senatorial families were wealthy, others were not; where\r\nwealth was possessed it generally consisted of large landed estates.\r\nAll members of the Senate, whether rich or poor, were possessed of\r\nvaluable political rights and opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe other element of the aristocracy included the merchants and\r\nspeculators, who had control of the financial affairs of the city and\r\nof the government, and who had been rapidly accumulating large\r\nfortunes, during the period which had elapsed since the Punic Wars.\r\nGracchus played for the support of this element at the same time that\r\nhe assailed the power of the Senate.\r\n\r\nBy the terms of the Calpurnian Law, passed in 149 B.C., it had been\r\nprovided that all provincial magistrates accused of dishonesty in\r\ntheir administration should be tried before the prætor peregrinus and\r\na jury selected from the Senate. It was now voted that the jury should\r\nbe taken not from the Senate but from a body of three hundred men\r\nselected from all Roman citizens who possessed the amount of property\r\nwhich entitled a person to be enrolled among the equites. From the\r\nstandpoint of judicial reform the fairness of this act could not be\r\nquestioned. However gross might have been the misgovernment of any\r\nprovincial Roman official, it was generally impossible to secure a\r\nconviction before a senatorial jury. As one historian (Liddell) sums\r\nup the matter:\r\n\r\n     \"These courts had given little satisfaction. In all\r\n     important cases of corruption, especially such as occurred\r\n     in the provinces, the offenders were themselves senators.\r\n     Some of the judges had been guilty of like offences;\r\n     extortion was looked upon as a venial crime; prosecutions\r\n     became a trial of party strength, and the culprit was\r\n     usually absolved.\"\r\n\r\nEqually important in the eyes of Gaius Gracchus, to the judicial\r\nreform thus effected, was the effect which the law had toward raising\r\nthe equites to a position where, as an order, they would be a\r\nformidable rival to the Senate. As a further bid for the support of\r\nthe moneyed aristocracy as against the old landed aristocracy and the\r\naristocracy of birth, Gracchus, in providing for the levying of new\r\ntaxes in the province of Asia, proposed the innovation of having the\r\ntax farmed out at Rome, instead of in the province itself.\r\n\r\nAnother law did away with an old established abuse in the assignment\r\nof provinces by the Senate to pro-consuls. Heretofore, each consul had\r\nhad his province assigned to him after his election, and the most\r\ndesirable provinces had therefore fallen to those toward whom the\r\nSenate was the most friendly. It was now decreed that the provinces\r\nfor the two consuls for each year should be assigned before the\r\nelection of the consuls, and that the consuls should determine, either\r\nby agreement or by lot, which of the two provinces should fall to\r\neach.\r\n\r\nThe first of the economic measures of Gaius Gracchus was one to renew\r\nand extend the agrarian law of his brother. In connection with this\r\nlaw the right to decide whether land was public or private was once\r\nmore given to the Agrarian Commission, and provisions were also made\r\nproviding that new colonies should be founded in different parts of\r\nItaly and also in the provinces. The carrying into execution of this\r\nlast provision was to be postponed until the following year. The\r\nproposal to found colonies beyond the limits of Italy marked an\r\ninnovation both in Roman law and in the economic habits and customs of\r\nthe Romans.\r\n\r\nAnother law provided that the Roman government should undertake the\r\nwork of providing grain for its citizens; that every person possessing\r\nthe Roman franchise should have the right of purchasing grain from the\r\ngovernment at the price of six and a third asses per modius (the set\r\nprice being far under the market value); and that the losses sustained\r\nin this grain trade should be taken out of the public treasury. Of all\r\nthe proposed reforms of the Gracchi this is the least defensible, and\r\nthe one which had the greatest influence upon the future. Lord\r\nMacaulay, in the course of his speech made on the third reading of the\r\ngreat English Reform Bill of 1832, said:\r\n\r\n     \"The defect is not in the Reform Bill, but in the very\r\n     nature of government. On the physical condition of the great\r\n     body of people government acts not as a specific, but as an\r\n     alterative. Its operation is powerful, indeed, and certain,\r\n     but gradual and indirect. The end of government is not\r\n     directly to make the people rich, but to protect them in\r\n     making themselves rich--and a government which attempts more\r\n     than this is precisely the government which is likely to\r\n     perform less. Governments do not and cannot support the\r\n     people. We have no miraculous powers--and we have not the\r\n     rod of the Hebrew lawgiver--we cannot rain down bread on the\r\n     multitude from Heaven--we cannot smite the rock and give\r\n     them to drink. We can give them only freedom to employ their\r\n     industry to the best advantage, and security in the\r\n     enjoyment of what their industry has acquired.\"\r\n\r\nThe fundamental principles of the science of government and political\r\neconomy, so forcibly expressed by Lord Macaulay on this occasion, and\r\nwhich must be both understood and applied by every successful\r\nlawmaker, were throughout his career thoroughly realized by Tiberius\r\nGracchus, and were also generally appreciated by his younger brother.\r\nOn this occasion, however, Gaius Gracchus lost sight of, or recklessly\r\ndisregarded, all the basic principles of the true science of\r\ngovernment or economics. If it became the permanent policy of Rome to\r\nprovide food for a great proportion of her citizens, this could only\r\nresult finally in their permanent pauperization. The effect of this\r\nlaw was certain to be the opposite of that sought by the agrarian laws\r\nof the two Gracchi.\r\n\r\nThe object of the latter laws was to bring the Roman citizens, or as\r\nmany of them as possible, \"back to the soil\"; to develop once more\r\nthat race of hardy Roman peasants, whose arms had won the great\r\nmilitary victories of the Roman republic; and to reduce both the\r\nnumbers and the influence of the unemployed and dangerous proletariat\r\nof the city. The law as to the sale of grain was not only certain to\r\nhave an influence in an exactly opposite direction to that which would\r\nbe exerted by the agrarian law, if this latter law could be put into\r\nsuccessful operation, but, more than this, the operation of the grain\r\nlaw would render the success of the agrarian law far more difficult\r\nand doubtful. The truth of the matter was that the success of the\r\nagrarian law was endangered not only by the opposition of the\r\naristocracy but also by the present character of the Roman\r\nproletariat. The course of events at Rome during the previous century\r\nand a half had done much to destroy the stamina of the mass of the\r\nRoman people; and a life of economic independence, as the result of\r\nhard labor in the country, held less attractions for the majority of\r\nthis class than an easily secured, though meager, living in the city.\r\nAnything which rendered life in Rome easier and more pleasant made it\r\nso much the harder to induce Roman citizens to settle on the farms. No\r\nlegislation ever yet passed in Rome had aroused such immediate and\r\nuniversal enthusiasm among the poorer classes at Rome as did this law\r\nrelative to the sale of grain.\r\n\r\nThis law, the worst of those proposed by the Gracchi, was destined to\r\nhave the greatest influence of any of those laws upon the course of\r\ndevelopment of Roman history. It is a peculiar phenomenon to be\r\nobserved in the study of the psychology of dishonesty that while the\r\nbeneficiaries of any system of \"graft\" will fight to the last\r\nextremity against any infringement upon their interests, sometimes\r\neven, as was the case with French nobility at the time of the French\r\nRevolution, carrying their resistance to such limits as to involve\r\nthemselves and their country in a common ruin; nevertheless, it is\r\noften easy to induce these favored interests to assist in the\r\nestablishment of some other system of \"graft\" for the benefit of\r\ncertain classes of their opponents.\r\n\r\nWhen a class has become so blinded to the true standard of right and\r\nwrong, and of relative values, as to look upon special privileges for\r\nthe few against the many, and long-continued systems of dishonesty, as\r\n\"vested interests,\" it seems to be much easier for them to submit to\r\nwrongful exactions from others than to cease from such wrongful\r\nexactions themselves. Thus, in the case of the grain laws at Rome, the\r\naristocratic party, unrelenting in their opposition to the agrarian\r\nlaws of the Gracchi, which would put an end to long-continued robbing\r\nof the state and go far toward building up again a class of free\r\nyeoman landowners, without opposition acquiesced in the establishment\r\nof a system of wholesale exploitation of the state for the maintenance\r\nat the public expense of a lazy, worthless, and corrupt mob.\r\n\r\nThe fatal idea contained in the grain law, having obtained a foothold\r\nin the Roman policy, rapidly developed. Fifty years after the law of\r\nGaius Gracchus it was necessary to limit the amount of grain which\r\ncould be purchased by any one citizen to five modii (about one and a\r\nquarter bushels) per month; at this period forty thousand citizens\r\nwere regular purchasers of grain from the state. At a little later\r\nperiod it was provided that five modii per month should be given\r\nwithout charge to such citizens as might require it. At one time the\r\nnumber of Roman citizens receiving this free allowance of grain rose\r\nto three hundred and twenty thousand. The Emperor Augustus fixed the\r\nmaximum number to whom such allowance should be given at two hundred\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\nThe permanent and continuing effect of these grain laws was to further\r\ndemoralize free labor in Italy and the character of the Roman citizen,\r\nand to bring about a constantly increasing use of slave labor in\r\nagriculture and of mercenaries in war.\r\n\r\nOne of the minor laws introduced by Gaius Gracchus was that which\r\nfixed the minimum age for military service at seventeen, and provided\r\nthat the uniform and arms of the soldiers should be furnished by the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nA more important law, and one whose object was both to better economic\r\nconditions and to strike at the power of the Senate, was a law calling\r\nfor large expenditures for the purpose of improving the roads through\r\nItaly and building new roads, and which gave the complete management\r\nof such work to the tribunes. Previously, the control of all public\r\nworks and improvements had been in the hands of the censors, subject\r\nto the supervision of the Senate.\r\n\r\nIt was to the carrying out of this last-mentioned law that Gaius\r\ndevoted his greatest energies during the year of his first\r\ntribuneship. The improvement of the commercial roads throughout Italy\r\nwas a work which all classes in the community must approve; and even\r\nthe enemies of Gracchus could but praise the executive ability and the\r\nuntiring energy with which he supervised the carrying out of the work.\r\n\r\nThe great system of internal improvements undertaken this year,\r\nhowever, attracted to Rome a great multitude of people from all parts\r\nof Italy, and tended to accentuate the bad feeling on the part of the\r\nmass of the Roman citizens toward the Italians.\r\n\r\nGaius Gracchus was, for the time, the complete master of the political\r\nsituation. In the consular election of 123 B.C. he was able to secure\r\nthe election of C. Fannius, an old friend and supporter of his\r\nbrother, and the defeat of L. Opimius, the candidate of the senatorial\r\nparty. The position of tribune had now become of such dignity and\r\nimportance that Fulvius Flaccus, although he had already held the\r\noffice of consul, presented himself as a candidate for this office in\r\nthe election of this year.\r\n\r\nGracchus did not present himself as a candidate for reëlection on\r\naccount of the law, or custom, against reëlection to this office.\r\nHowever, he was reëlected tribune this year, although the manner in\r\nwhich his reëlection was brought about is not very clear to us. The\r\nRoman historians say that as a sufficient number of candidates did not\r\npresent themselves to fill all the positions of tribunes, the comitia\r\ntributa reëlected Gracchus under the law which gave them the right to\r\nreëlect a tribune under such conditions.\r\n\r\nThis is the only occasion upon which we hear anything of this law, and\r\nwe have no knowledge as to when it was passed, or as to what were its\r\nexact provisions. Some writers, of that school of historians hostile\r\nto the work of Tiberius Gracchus, hint that a law authorizing the\r\nreëlection of tribunes, under the peculiar circumstances above\r\nmentioned, must have been enacted since the death of Tiberius\r\nGracchus. The theory of these writers involves the assumption of the\r\nenactment of a law prohibiting the reëlection of tribunes, and then of\r\nanother law limiting the application of the first law, although we\r\nhave no evidence as to the passage of either of such laws, and no\r\nevidence of their existence, except during the conflicts of the\r\nGracchi.\r\n\r\nUpon his reëlection Gaius Gracchus, probably largely through the\r\ninfluence of Flaccus, introduced a bill to extend the franchise to all\r\nthe Latin colonies and probably to all the citizens of the Italian\r\ncommunities. The measure was that of a patriot and a statesman, but it\r\nproved the undoing of its author. The measure failed to pass, and its\r\nintroduction destroyed a great part of the influence and popularity of\r\nGaius Gracchus.\r\n\r\nTrouble and unpopularity next came to Gaius Gracchus from the\r\ncolonies which were to be founded during this year. Gracchus entered\r\nupon this work in a conservative manner, starting out with only a few\r\ncolonies, at the outset sending only a few citizens to each colony and\r\nadmitting no citizen to any of the colonies unless he was of a\r\nrespectable character.\r\n\r\nThe Senate, seeing the power of Gaius Gracchus tottering, resolved to\r\ndestroy him politically by taking away his influence with the people.\r\nTo accomplish this purpose Marcus Livius Drusus, who also held the\r\noffice of tribune but who was a man of great wealth and affiliated\r\nwith the senatorial party, was put forward to outbid Gracchus for the\r\npopular approval. In pursuance of this plan Drusus introduced a law\r\nfor the immediate settlement of twelve colonies, each colony to\r\nconsist of three thousand families, chosen without regard to their\r\ncharacter, and each colonist to hold his land rent free. The passage\r\nof this Livian Law, as it was called, marked the close of the control\r\nof Gaius Gracchus over the comitia tributa. In the elections of 122\r\nB.C. L. Opimius, the enemy of Gracchus, was elected consul, and\r\nneither Gracchus nor Flaccus was reëlected tribune.\r\n\r\nThe opponents of Gracchus, however, were not content with having\r\ndriven him from political power, but were resolved upon depriving him\r\nof life as well. An excuse for an attack upon Gaius Gracchus was found\r\nin a report from Carthage that the colony founded there by Gracchus\r\nhad been situated upon ground which had been cursed by Scipio at the\r\ntime of the destruction of Carthage. Acting upon this report, the\r\nSenate directed the tribunes to call a meeting of the comitia tributa\r\nfor the purpose of revoking the law relative to the colony at\r\nCarthage.\r\n\r\nUpon the day of the meeting of the tribes one of the followers of the\r\nconsul Opimius, who had taken occasion to insult Gaius Gracchus, was\r\nstabbed by some unknown person. The senatorial party now had the\r\nopportunity to secure their prey, and immediately proceeded to\r\naccomplish their purpose. The meeting of the comitia tributa was\r\nbroken up, and a meeting of the Senate called, at which Gracchus was\r\ndeclared a public enemy and the consuls directed to take steps to\r\nsecure the safety of the republic.\r\n\r\nIt is outside the purpose of this work to go into the details of the\r\nbutchery of the next day in which Gaius Gracchus, Fulvius Flaccus, and\r\nthree thousand of their supporters lost their lives. The charge that\r\nGaius Gracchus had planned to do what Julius Cæsar was to do in the\r\nnext century, make himself dictator, or emperor, of Rome, is best\r\ndisproved by the absolute lack of any military preparations on the\r\npart of Gracchus, even to the extent of securing his own safety when\r\nhe knew his life was in constant danger.\r\n\r\nAlthough the friends of Gracchus and Flaccus had gathered together to\r\nprotect their leaders, they were without either proper arms or any\r\nsystem of military organization, and were cut down, almost without\r\nresistance, by the armed forces which had been collected by the\r\nconsul, Opimius. Mention might be made of the fruitless heroism\r\ndisplayed by some of those friends of Gaius Gracchus who remained true\r\nto him to the last; but the flashes of brightness were few, and the\r\nday must ever be recorded as one of the darkest in all Roman history.\r\n\r\nIt was this day that marked the final failure of the last movement\r\nwhich might have saved and rejuvenated the great Roman republic; it\r\nwas this day that showed the right of manhood was no longer the\r\nhighest right in Rome, and that the rule of special and vested\r\ninterests was now supreme.\r\n\r\nThe singleness of purpose and openness of character in Tiberius\r\nGracchus leave no opening for speculation or doubt as to the motives\r\nfrom which he acted or the objects which he sought. Both the character\r\nand the actions of Gaius Gracchus are more complex than those of his\r\nbrother, and many historians have doubted the disinterestedness of his\r\nagitation for popular rights. The final summaries upon the character\r\nof this man, of two recent historians, are as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"The man who originates is always so far greater than the\r\n     man who imitates, and Caius only followed where his brother\r\n     led. The very dream which Caius told to the people shows\r\n     that his brother's spell was still on him, and his telling\r\n     it, together with his impetuous oratory and his avowed\r\n     fatalism, militates against the theory that Tiberius was\r\n     swayed by impulse and sentiment, and he by calculation and\r\n     reason. But no doubt he profited by experience of the past.\r\n     He had learned how to bide his time, and to think generosity\r\n     wasted on the murderous crew whom he had sworn to punish.\r\n     Pure in life, perfectly prepared for a death to which he\r\n     considered himself foredoomed, glowing with one fervent\r\n     passion, he took up his brother's cause with a double\r\n     portion of his brother's spirit, because he had thought more\r\n     before action, because he had greater natural eloquence, and\r\n     because being forewarned he was forearmed.\r\n\r\n     \"In spite of the labours of recent historians, the\r\n     legislation of Caius Gracchus is still hard to understand.\r\n     Where the original authorities contradict each other, as\r\n     they often do, probable conjecture is the most which can be\r\n     attained, and no attempt will be made here to specify what\r\n     were the measures of the first tribunate of Caius, and what\r\n     of the second. The general scope and tendency of his\r\n     legislation is clear enough. It was to overthrow the\r\n     senatorial government, and in the new government to give the\r\n     chief share of the executive power to the mercantile class,\r\n     and the chief share of the legislative power to Italians.\r\n     These were his immediate aims. Probably he meant to keep all\r\n     the strings he thus set in motion in his own hands, so as to\r\n     be practically monarch of Rome. But whether he definitely\r\n     conceived the idea of monarchy, and, looking beyond his own\r\n     requirements, pictured to himself a successor at some future\r\n     time inheriting the authority which he had established, no\r\n     one can say.\" (Beesly.)\r\n\r\n     \"It is clear that he did not wish to place the Roman\r\n     Republic on a new democratic basis, but that he wished to\r\n     abolish it, and introduce in its stead an absolute\r\n     despotism, in the form of an unlimited tribuneship for life.\r\n     Nor can he be blamed for it; as, though an absolute monarchy\r\n     is a great misfortune for a nation, it is a less misfortune\r\n     than an absolute oligarchy. Besides this, he was fired with\r\n     the passion for a speedy vengeance, and was in fact a\r\n     political incendiary--the author not only of the one hundred\r\n     years' revolution, which dates from him, but the founder of\r\n     that terrible urban proletariat which, utterly demoralized\r\n     by corn largesses and the flattery of the classes above it,\r\n     and at the same time conscious of its power, lay like an\r\n     incubus for five hundred years on the Roman commonwealth,\r\n     and only perished with it.\r\n\r\n     \"Many of the fundamental maxims of Roman monarchy may be\r\n     traced to Gracchus. He first laid down that all the land of\r\n     subject communities was to be regarded as the private\r\n     property of the state--a maxim first applied to vindicate\r\n     the right of the state to tax the land and then to send out\r\n     colonies to it, which later became a fundamental principle\r\n     of law under the empire. He invented the tactics by which\r\n     his successors broke down the governing aristocracy, and\r\n     substituted strict and judicious administration for the\r\n     previous misgovernment. He first opened the way to a\r\n     reconciliation between Rome and the provinces, and his\r\n     attempt to rebuild Carthage and to give an opportunity for\r\n     Italian emigration to the provinces was the first link in\r\n     the chain of that beneficial course of action. Right and\r\n     wrong, fortune and misfortune, were so inextricably blended\r\n     in this singular man and in this marvelous political\r\n     constellation, that it may well beseem history in this\r\n     case--though it beseems her but seldom--to reserve her\r\n     judgment.\" (Mommsen.)\r\n\r\nMuch of the criticism of each of these historians is manifestly true;\r\nbut the charge that Gaius Gracchus contemplated the substitution of\r\nthe rule of a despot for the rule of the oligarchy seems not to be\r\nborne out by the facts.\r\n\r\nA true understanding of the policies and objects of Gaius Gracchus can\r\nbe had only when we start our investigation with an appreciation of\r\nthe strongest motive which urged him onward. This motive was not, on\r\nthe one hand, a deep-rooted love and reverence for popular rights (as\r\nwas undoubtedly the case with his brother Tiberius); nor, on the other\r\nhand, was it selfish interest, or the desire to usurp to himself the\r\nsupreme power in the state. The strongest influence in the life and\r\ncharacter of Gaius Gracchus was the desire to be avenged upon the\r\nsenatorial party for the murder of his brother. His efforts in behalf\r\nof popular rights were instigated primarily by the desire to show\r\nrespect to his brother's memory and to carry out his brother's\r\npolicies. Upon this hypothesis the life and character of Gaius\r\nGracchus can be easily understood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nMARIUS AND SULLA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Roman government after the death of Gaius Gracchus, while still\r\nnominally a republic, had lost all its democratic character and had\r\nonce more become an oligarchy such as had existed centuries before,\r\nduring the period of the patrician republic. It was evident, however,\r\nthat the existing situation could not permanently continue. The\r\noligarchical government is that form of government which from its very\r\nnature can never acquire stability. Both democracy and monarchy\r\npossess elements of strength which may give to such governments a long\r\ncontinuance of life; the oligarchy, lacking both the strength of\r\nfoundation of the one and the unity of action of the other, must\r\ninevitably be supplanted by a freer or a more restricted system of\r\ngovernment. After the fall of Gaius Gracchus the last opportunity for\r\nthe re-creation in Rome of a truly democratic form of government was\r\nlost. It should have been evident to any one who could read the signs\r\nof the future that the power for the time possessed by the senatorial\r\noligarchy would soon be snatched from it, either by the frenzied hand\r\nof a mob or by the strong hand of a despot.\r\n\r\nFew in Rome at this time, however, seem to have been thinking much\r\nabout the future. To reactionists or even to conservatives the future\r\nis always almost an unknown word; satisfied with the present, or\r\nlooking back with regret to the past, the supporters of special\r\ninterests and the votaries of tradition walk backward over the\r\nprecipice, the near presence of which they will neither see for\r\nthemselves nor be warned of by others.\r\n\r\nA flicker of life on the part of the popular party was seen in an\r\neffort by the tribune Decius to indict the former consul Opimius for\r\nhis part in the murder of Gaius Gracchus and his friends. The defense\r\nof Opimius was undertaken by the renegade Carbo. The life of this\r\npolitician seems an excellent example in proof of the statement that\r\nthe demagogue seeks the favor of the people only for his own\r\nadvantage, and that as soon as he has acquired such favor, and has\r\nbecome a person of influence, his next step is to sell himself, now\r\nvaluable on account of the political power he has acquired through\r\nhis hypocrisy toward the people, to the special interests. No better\r\ncontrast can be found in history between the true reformer and the\r\nunprincipled demagogue than is the contrast between Tiberius Gracchus\r\nand Carbo. While it is comparatively easy, however, to go back into\r\npast ages and to separate the sheep from the goats, and to distinguish\r\nbetween reformer and hypocrite, it is a much harder undertaking to do\r\nthis with the living politicians. It often happens that the people are\r\ntoo ready to follow the demagogue and to repudiate and ridicule the\r\nhonest reformer. Striking illustrations of this phenomenon could\r\neasily be given from recent American history. The doctrine of the\r\nsurvival of the fittest applies in all sciences, social as well as\r\nnatural. In all its applications, however, this doctrine is that of\r\nthe survival of the fittest to meet existing conditions, not the\r\nsurvival of the fittest from the standpoint of absolute merit. With\r\nthose who attempt to secure the political support of the proletariat\r\nof a great city, merit is to a great extent a handicap, and a certain\r\nclass of vices the greatest advantage.\r\n\r\nThere are some men naturally so constituted that the doctrine that the\r\nend justifies the means can be consistently and safely applied by them\r\nin their public life. To this class have belonged most of those men\r\nthrough whom all the greatest victories for liberty and the greatest\r\nreforms in this world have been finally achieved. The mass of mankind,\r\nhowever, are incapable of consistently and permanently following the\r\ndoctrine; and with all men, except the few above referred to, the\r\ncharacter of their objects and methods must act and react upon each\r\nother. The result is that those seeking reform and honesty in\r\npolitics, in the main seek to accomplish their purposes by honest\r\nmethods; while the demagogue, seeking his own interests alone, a\r\nhypocrite as to his motives, will never consider as to the honesty of\r\nhis methods. It is only on exceptional occasions that the honest\r\nadvocate of popular rights can win the support of the mob by honest\r\nmethods. Several causes work together to accomplish this result. In\r\nthe lower economic strata the individual is far more strongly\r\ninfluenced by his own immediate interests than by the permanent\r\ninterests of the class to which he belongs. Perhaps it would be too\r\nmuch to expect the contrary.\r\n\r\nWe have constantly before us to-day the spectacle of men who--loudest\r\nin their denunciation of the discrimination which public officials\r\nexercise in favor of the special classes and against the common\r\ncitizen--at election time, in consideration of a few dollars for\r\nthemselves, exert all their influence in favor of the worst exponents\r\nof the system they denounce. By the return, in the form of direct or\r\nindirect bribes to a selected few of the proletariat, of a small\r\nportion of the money previously illegally or unjustly exploited from\r\nthe poor, the politicians of the \"practical\" type are able to secure\r\nthe assent of the greater portion of the proletariat to the\r\ncontinuation of such exploitation.\r\n\r\nAgain, the candidate or political leader who intends to carry out his\r\npromises is under a disadvantage in comparison with the candidate or\r\nleader who does not. There are limitations to what government can\r\naccomplish; there are no limitations to what a demagogue can promise.\r\nThere is no more unfavorable criticism possible upon the lack of\r\nproper intelligence of the majority of the American voters than the\r\ncharacter of the promises and the arguments which are received with\r\napplause at political meetings of every political party.\r\n\r\nThis criticism upon the political actions of the poorer classes,\r\neconomically, by no means indicates that they are the least desirable\r\nclass of voters in a country, or that a country would be better\r\ngoverned if the ballot were taken away from them. The truth of the\r\nmatter is that it is mainly by the votes and efforts of the lowest\r\nclasses in a community (from the standpoint of wealth and social\r\nstatus) that every great reform or popular victory must be achieved.\r\nIt is at the great crises that the masses are most generally right,\r\nand the classes most generally wrong. No phenomenon of history is more\r\nclear and more striking than that, at every great crisis of the\r\nworld's history, the mass of the wealthy and educated classes has been\r\nalways wrong. Nowhere is this more plainly to be discerned than in the\r\nhistory of our own country. In the Revolutionary days the great mass\r\nof the wealth and education in the country was to be found on the\r\nTory side. At the crisis the concrete question of personal interest\r\nprevails over the abstract idea of public welfare; those who are\r\npersonally satisfied with existing conditions are slow to advocate a\r\nchange; those who have little to lose find it easier to be courageous.\r\nNext to the small nucleus of true reformers, the first adherents of\r\nany reform movement are apt to be the discontented and restless\r\nelements of the community.\r\n\r\nWe can see a working example of this phenomenon, many centuries ago,\r\nin the brief account which the Bible gives us of the recruiting of the\r\nforce with which David first offered resistance to King Saul. \"David\r\ntherefore departed thence, and escaped to the Cave Adullam: and when\r\nhis brethren and all his father's house heard it, they went down\r\nthither to him. And every one that was in distress, and every one that\r\nwas in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves\r\nunto him; and he became a captain over them.\"\r\n\r\nIn the case of the demagogue Carbo, we find him, after a violent\r\ncareer as a popular tribune, selling his influence and services to the\r\nsenatorial party, of which he was henceforth the most servient tool.\r\nHe was rewarded for his services to this party by an election as\r\nconsul, and it was during his consulship (120 B.C.) that the\r\nindictment was brought against Opimius. Carbo's influence, coupled\r\nwith the fear which the murderers of the Gracchi and their followers\r\nhad left in the minds of the people, was sufficient to secure the\r\nacquittal of Opimius. The triumph of Carbo, however, was short-lived.\r\nHe was himself indicted by L. Licinius Crassus, brother-in-law of\r\nGaius Gracchus, and the manifestation of the feeling against him\r\nbecame so bitter that Carbo was driven to take his own life by poison.\r\n\r\nThe Roman politicians of the next few years, the Metelli, Æmilius\r\nScaurus, and others, left little impress upon the course of Roman\r\nhistory, and their lives and triumphs are of little interest to us.\r\nTheir aims were of a strictly personal character, their civic work was\r\nof a routine character; if they did little harm to the state, they\r\nconferred no benefit upon it.\r\n\r\nThe most important event of the closing years of the second century\r\nbefore Christ was the famous, or rather infamous, Jugurthine War. The\r\nstory of this war furnishes the final evidence as to the corruption\r\nand degradation of Roman politics and officials at this time. This war\r\narose out of a disputed succession to the throne of Numidia. Jugurtha,\r\nat first the friend and ally of Rome, after he had secured possession\r\nof the whole country through the murder of his two rivals, his\r\ncousins, found himself at last at war with Rome. The fortune of war\r\ngoing against him, he secured an advantageous peace by bribing the\r\nRoman general. The facts relative to this peace becoming known at\r\nRome, Jugurtha was summoned to appear at Rome to give his account of\r\nthe proceedings. His history, during this famous visit to Rome, is\r\nthus related by the Roman historian Sallust:\r\n\r\n     \"During the course of these proceedings at Rome, those whom\r\n     Bestia had left in Numidia in command of the army, following\r\n     the example of their general, had been guilty of many\r\n     scandalous transactions. Some, seduced by gold, had restored\r\n     Jugurtha his elephants; others had sold him his deserters;\r\n     others had ravaged the lands of those at peace with us; so\r\n     strong a spirit of rapacity, like the contagion of a\r\n     pestilence, had pervaded the breasts of all.\r\n\r\n     \"Cassius, when the measure proposed by Memmius had been\r\n     carried, and whilst all the nobility were in consternation,\r\n     set out on his mission to Jugurtha, whom, alarmed as he was,\r\n     and despairing of his fortune, from a sense of guilt, he\r\n     admonished 'that, since he had surrendered himself to the\r\n     Romans, he had better make trial of their mercy than their\r\n     power.' He also pledged his own word, which Jugurtha valued\r\n     not less than that of the public, for his safety. Such, at\r\n     that period, was the reputation of Cassius.\r\n\r\n     \"Jugurtha, accordingly, accompanied Cassius to Rome, but\r\n     without any mark of royalty, and in the garb, as much as\r\n     possible, of a suppliant; and, though he felt great\r\n     confidence on his own part, and was supported by all those\r\n     through whose power or villainy he had accomplished his\r\n     projects, he purchased, by a vast bribe, the aid of Caius\r\n     Bæbius, a tribune of the people, by whose audacity he hoped\r\n     to be protected against the law, and against all harm.\r\n\r\n     \"An assembly of the people being convoked, Memmius, although\r\n     they were violently exasperated against Jugurtha (some\r\n     demanding that he should be cast into prison, others that,\r\n     unless he should name his accomplices in guilt, he should be\r\n     put to death, according to the usage of their ancestors, as\r\n     a public enemy) yet, regarding rather their character than\r\n     their resentment, endeavoured to calm their turbulence and\r\n     mitigate their rage; and assured them that, as far as\r\n     depended on him, the public faith should not be broken. At\r\n     length, when silence was obtained, he brought forward\r\n     Jugurtha, and addressed them. He detailed the misdeeds of\r\n     Jugurtha at Rome and in Numidia, and set forth his crimes\r\n     towards his father and brothers; and admonished the prince\r\n     'that the Roman people, though they were well aware by whose\r\n     support and agency he had acted, yet desired further\r\n     testimony from himself; that, if he disclosed the truth,\r\n     there was great hope for him in the honour and clemency of\r\n     the Romans; but if he concealed it, he would certainly not\r\n     save his accomplices, but ruin himself and his hopes\r\n     forever.'\r\n\r\n     \"But when Memmius had concluded his speech, and Jugurtha was\r\n     expected to give his answer, Caius Bæbius, the tribune of\r\n     the people, whom I have just noticed as having been bribed,\r\n     enjoined the prince to hold his peace; and though the\r\n     multitude who formed the assembly were desperately enraged,\r\n     and endeavoured to terrify the tribune by outcries, by angry\r\n     looks, by violent gestures, and by every other act to which\r\n     anger prompts, his audacity was at last triumphant. The\r\n     people, mocked and set at naught, withdrew from the place of\r\n     assembly, and the confidence of Jugurtha, Bestia, and the\r\n     others whom this investigation had alarmed, was greatly\r\n     augmented.\r\n\r\n     \"There was at this period in Rome, a certain Numidian named\r\n     Massiva, a son of Gulussa and grandson of Masinissa, who,\r\n     from having been, in the dissensions among princes, opposed\r\n     to Jugurtha, had been obliged, after the surrender of Cirta\r\n     and the murder of Adherbal, to make his escape out of\r\n     Africa. Spurius Albinus, who was consul with Quintus\r\n     Minucius Rufus the year after Bestia, prevailed upon this\r\n     man, as he was of the family of Masinissa, and as odium and\r\n     terror hung over Jugurtha for his crimes, to petition the\r\n     senate for the kingdom of Numidia. Albinus, being eager for\r\n     the conduct of a war, was desirous that affairs should be\r\n     disturbed, rather than sink into tranquillity; especially\r\n     as, in the division of the provinces, Numidia had fallen to\r\n     himself, and Macedonia to Minucius.\r\n\r\n     \"When Massiva proceeded to carry these suggestions into\r\n     execution, Jugurtha, finding that he had no sufficient\r\n     support in his friends, as a sense of guilt deterred some\r\n     and evil report or timidity, others from coming forward in\r\n     his behalf, directed Bomilcar, his most attached and\r\n     faithful adherent, to procure by the aid of money, by which\r\n     he had already effected so much, assassins to kill Massiva;\r\n     and to do it secretly if he could, but if secrecy should be\r\n     impossible, to cut him off in any way whatsoever. This\r\n     commission Bomilcar soon found means to execute; and, by the\r\n     agency of men versed in such service, ascertained the\r\n     direction of his journeys, his hours of leaving home, and\r\n     the times at which he resorted to particular places, and,\r\n     when all was ready, placed his assassins in ambush. One of\r\n     their number sprang upon Massiva, though with too little\r\n     caution, and killed him; but, being himself caught, he made\r\n     at the instigation of many, and especially of Albinus the\r\n     consul, a full confession. Bomilcar was accordingly\r\n     committed for trial, though rather on the principles of\r\n     reason and justice than in accordance with the law of\r\n     nations, as he was in the retinue of one who had come to\r\n     Rome on a pledge of the public faith for his safety. But\r\n     Jugurtha, though clearly guilty of the crime, did not cease\r\n     to struggle against the truth, until he perceived that the\r\n     infamy of the deed was too strong for his interest or his\r\n     money. For that reason, although at the commencement of the\r\n     proceedings, he had given fifty of his friends as bail for\r\n     Bomilcar, yet thinking more of his kingdom than of the\r\n     sureties, he sent him off privately into Numidia, for he\r\n     feared that if such a man should be executed, his other\r\n     subjects would be deterred from obeying him. A few days\r\n     after, he himself departed, having been ordered by the\r\n     senate to quit Italy. But, as he was going from Rome, he is\r\n     said, after frequently looking back on it in silence, to\r\n     have at last exclaimed that 'it was a venal city, and would\r\n     soon perish, if it could but find a purchaser.'\"\r\n\r\nUpon the resumption of the war with Jugurtha the Romans at first met\r\nwith a great disaster, the army under Spurius Albinus being defeated\r\nand compelled to pass under the yoke and withdraw from Numidia. The\r\nresult of this defeat was a sweeping investigation of the wholesale\r\nbribery of Roman officials by Jugurtha. Many, though not all, of those\r\nguilty in this respect were punished by banishment. The conduct of the\r\nwar was now delegated to Q. Cæcilius Metellus, by whom it was soon\r\nafter brought to a successful termination. This result, however, was\r\ndue less to the military genius of Metellus than to that of his\r\nlieutenant Gaius Marius, who immediately afterwards became the central\r\nfigure in the political arena at Rome.\r\n\r\nMarius was born near Arpinum about 157 B.C. of peasant parents.\r\nAbandoning agriculture for the army, at a very early age he had won\r\ndistinction not only for personal strength and courage but also for\r\nmilitary ability. As early as the year 132 B.C. Scipio Africanus, once\r\nbeing asked by a flatterer where a general could be found to fill his\r\nplace, touched the arm of Marius, who happened to be present on the\r\noccasion, and answered, \"Perhaps here.\" It was not only in the field\r\nof war but also in that of politics that Marius had won a reputation\r\nbefore the time that he served under Metellus against Jugurtha. Being\r\nelected tribune in 119 B.C., his actions, upon some unimportant\r\ncontroversies which arose during the year, had been such as to show\r\nthe determination and ferocity of his disposition, and to win the\r\nfavor of the populace and the distrust of the senatorial party.\r\nThrough the influence of the aristocracy Marius was defeated for both\r\nthe ædileships, but was finally elected prætor in 115 B.C.\r\n\r\nIt was while he was serving under Metellus in Africa that Marius\r\nbecame a candidate for the consulship. The idea of Marius as consul\r\nwas very distasteful to Metellus, who permitted Marius to leave the\r\ncamp for Rome only twelve days before the day set for the election.\r\nMarius, by almost superhuman exertions, succeeded in making the\r\njourney to Rome in the first six of these days, and in the remaining\r\nsix conducted a successful campaign for the consulship.\r\n\r\nThe election of Marius to the consulship marks the beginning of the\r\nlast age of the Roman republic. With Marius began the habitual rule of\r\nmight rather than of right; rule by armies, instead of rule by\r\nmajorities. For something over half a century power at Rome was to be\r\nshuffled backward and forward between different military commanders,\r\nuntil finally a military despot arose strong enough both to overthrow\r\nthe oligarchy and to put down the mob. The manner in which the Romans\r\nhad abstained from internal violence for centuries, during all the\r\nheat of so many bitter political and class contests, is one of the\r\nwonders of ancient history. The aristocracy first broke this rule by\r\nresorting to force to block the reforms of the Gracchi. Such a\r\nprocedure must always be a two-edged weapon, and Marius was the man\r\nfated to turn the sword against those who first drew it in Roman\r\npolitics. The very election of Marius as consul (107 B.C.) was the\r\noccasion of much disquietude to the oligarchy.\r\n\r\nAlthough the consulship had at this time, in theory, been for two\r\nhundred sixty years open to all Roman citizens, nevertheless, in\r\npractice, it had, with occasional exceptions, been confined to the\r\nmembers of the few great families. In fact, so general had this become\r\nthat a man who was the first of his family to be elected to this\r\noffice was known as a \"new man.\" Not only was Marius a \"new man,\" but\r\nhis immediate ancestors, in all probability, were men lower in the\r\nsocial and economic scale than had been the father and grandfather of\r\nany previous Roman consul. If the rise of Marius was a source of\r\ndanger to the senatorial party, the qualities which had rendered his\r\nsuccess possible were a source of danger to the whole community.\r\nMarius was and had been a soldier, and a soldier only. There is\r\nnothing in his whole life to indicate that he combined with the\r\nattributes of the general any of those of the statesman, as did Cæsar\r\nand Napoleon. The same fighting qualities which brought to him success\r\nin war likewise produced success in politics, and the same ferocity of\r\ndisposition was manifested in both fields.\r\n\r\nThe military ability of Marius, in connection with the peculiar\r\ncircumstances of the times, soon secured to this general a more\r\nabsolute control of the Roman community than had previously been\r\npossessed by any consul of Rome. The military ability of Marius has\r\nnever been disputed either by his contemporaries or by later\r\nhistorians. His military successes after his election to the\r\nconsulship were rapid and decisive. Where his predecessors had failed,\r\nMarius succeeded in the Jugurthine War, and the year 104 B.C.\r\nwitnessed at Rome the triumph of Marius, with the craftiest, ablest,\r\nand most unscrupulous of African kings walking in chains as a captive\r\nin his train.\r\n\r\nOf greater importance and benefit to Rome were the great victories won\r\nby Marius over those terrible invaders, the Teutones and the\r\nCimbrians, who had been threatening Rome and harassing northern Italy\r\nfor a number of years. In 102 B.C. the Teutones were defeated by\r\nMarius at the battle of Aquæ Sextiæ, where the number of the\r\nvanquished who were killed is variously estimated at from one hundred\r\ntwenty thousand to two hundred thousand. The following year, during\r\nthe fifth consulship of Marius, the Cimbrians were practically\r\nannihilated, sixty thousand being captured and sold as slaves and the\r\nremainder of the vast host, with few exceptions, killed.\r\n\r\nThe second century before Christ thus closed with brilliant foreign\r\nvictories for the Roman arms. This close likewise saw the beginning of\r\nanother period of slave insurrections and civil war. As before, the\r\nprincipal resistance by the slaves occurred in the island of Sicily.\r\nThe immediate cause of this insurrection was the neglect or refusal of\r\nthe Roman prætor in Sicily to obey a decree of the Senate. So great a\r\nscandal had arisen from the continued actions of the Roman tax\r\ncollectors in the East in seizing and selling into slavery persons who\r\nfailed to pay the exorbitant taxes demanded from them that the Senate\r\npassed a decree providing that all persons illegally held as slaves\r\nshould be immediately released. This decree would have affected so\r\nmany slaves in the island of Sicily that the prætor suspended its\r\noperation. The slaves, rendered desperate by seeing this promised\r\nliberty snatched from them, once more rose in rebellion.\r\n\r\nAgain the slaves were commanded by able leaders, and again they won a\r\nnumber of victories over Roman armies before they were finally put\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n     \"The revolt was thus apparently suppressed, yet many years\r\n     the disturbances continued, and there were innumerable local\r\n     insurrections, causing great carnage and unspeakable misery.\r\n     A Roman knight, Titus Minucius, harassed by debt, and\r\n     annoyed by the importunities of his creditors, through\r\n     revenge incited an insurrection, and placed himself at the\r\n     head of three thousand slaves. A bloody battle ensued before\r\n     he was put down. Soon after this, two very able slaves,\r\n     Sabrius and Athenio, headed revolts. Their forces were\r\n     marshaled in well-disciplined bands, and for some time they\r\n     successfully repelled all the power Rome could bring against\r\n     them. Several Roman armies were defeated with great loss,\r\n     and the whole island was surrendered to blood and violence.\r\n     The poorer class of the free inhabitants availed themselves\r\n     of the general confusion to indulge in unrestrained license\r\n     and devastation. This insurrection became so formidable,\r\n     that again Rome was compelled to rouse her energies. A\r\n     consular army was sent, which drove the insurgents into\r\n     their strongholds and then subdued them by the slow process\r\n     of siege. The carnage and misery resulting from these\r\n     servile wars no tongue can tell. The whole power of the\r\n     Roman empire was pledged to put down insurrections; and\r\n     though the captives could avenge their wrongs and sell their\r\n     lives dearly, it was in vain for them to hope for ultimate\r\n     success.\r\n\r\n     \"A law was passed prohibiting any slave from carrying a\r\n     warlike weapon. Rigorously was this law enforced. At one\r\n     time a boar of remarkable size was sent as a present to L.\r\n     Domicius, then prætor of the island. He inquired who had\r\n     killed it. On being informed that it was a slave, who was\r\n     employed as a shepherd, he summoned the man before him, and\r\n     asked how he had contrived to kill so powerful an animal.\r\n     The shepherd replied that he had killed it with a boar\r\n     spear. The merciless Domicius ordered him immediately to be\r\n     crucified for having used a weapon in violation of the law.\r\n     This rigor was pursued so unrelentingly, that, for a long\r\n     period, there were no more revolts!\" (Abbott's _History of\r\n     Italy_.)\r\n\r\nThe victories of Marius over the Teutones and Cimbrians had been\r\nfollowed by his sixth election to the consulship. This election,\r\nhowever, had not been secured without great difficulty and tumult. The\r\naristocratic party had been consistently the opponents and enemies of\r\nMarius throughout his whole career. The great victories which he had\r\nwon for Rome, instead of reconciling this class to him, had made them\r\nonly the more jealous and fearful of him.\r\n\r\nBy this time Marius had in addition, to a great extent, alienated the\r\nlower classes of the Roman citizens. The enmity between the\r\nproletariat at Rome and the Italians, which had commenced at the time\r\nof the younger Gracchus, had been constantly increasing. Marius had\r\ninclined more and more toward the side of the Italians. Like most\r\ngenerals, his thoughts and affections were for his soldiers rather\r\nthan for the state which he served; and the soldiers over whom Marius\r\nhad command and with whom he had won his great victories were mainly\r\nItalians. The degenerate city mob at Rome no longer desired or was fit\r\nfor military life, and the safety of Rome and the extension of her\r\nterritories now rested mainly upon those to whom the rights of her\r\ncitizenship were denied.\r\n\r\nThe Italians, probably appreciating both the strength of their\r\nposition and the injustice of their treatment, were demanding the\r\nrights of Roman citizenship, and in this demand they found a\r\nsympathizer in the consul Marius. Immediately after his victories in\r\nthe north of Italy, Marius, in direct violation of the law, had\r\ngranted Roman citizenship to one thousand soldiers in his army who had\r\ndistinguished themselves in the campaign. His excuse was\r\ncharacteristic of the existing conditions and prophetic of the course\r\nof Roman history during the succeeding century: \"Amid the din of arms,\r\nI could not hear the voice of the laws.\"\r\n\r\nDuring his sixth consulship Marius endeavored to secure the Roman\r\nfranchise for certain of his soldiers in a more regular manner. The\r\ntribunes, Apuleius Saturninus and Servilius Glaucia, secured the\r\npassage of a law by which Marius was authorized to grant the rights of\r\nRoman citizenship to three persons in every colony which enjoyed the\r\nLatin franchise.\r\n\r\nThe career of the tribune Saturninus is illustrative of the condition\r\nof anarchy into which Rome was rapidly drifting. Saturninus was the\r\nfirst of the Roman politicians to rely as a regular practice upon\r\n\"strong-arm methods\" to carry elections. In his first race for the\r\ntribuneship he had brazenly murdered one of the opposing candidates;\r\nhe had been the principal campaign manager for Marius at the time of\r\nhis sixth election to the consulship, when the disbanded army of\r\nMarius had been distributed among the Roman citizens in the meetings\r\nof the comitia tributa in such numbers as to overawe all opposition.\r\nFinally, when C. Memmius, a bitter political enemy of his, seemed\r\nabout to be elected to the consulship, he caused him to be stabbed in\r\nthe Forum by one of the thugs who constituted his own bodyguard.\r\nSaturninus, however, had now reached the point where he stood almost\r\nalone. The senatorial party were his natural enemies; the Roman mob\r\nhad, in the main, fallen away from his support on account of his\r\nfriendly feeling toward the Italians, and his extreme methods had\r\ncompelled even Marius to withdraw his support.\r\n\r\nSeeing his political power almost gone, Saturninus, in company with\r\nhis fellow-tribune Glaucia and a band of the ruffians with which Rome\r\nwas so badly infested at this time, seized the citadel on the capitol\r\nand attempted to raise an insurrection against the republic. The\r\ncitadel was considered to be impregnable to an attack, but Saturninus\r\nand his followers were soon forced into submission by the cutting off\r\nof their water supply. The insurgents had surrendered upon the\r\ncondition that their lives should be spared. Marius, in order to\r\nprotect their safety, imprisoned them in a large building, known as\r\nthe Curia Hostilia. The mob, however, climbed to the top of the\r\nbuilding, tore off the roof, and murdered all the prisoners by\r\ndropping rocks upon them.\r\n\r\nFor centuries one of the most striking characteristics of Roman\r\npolitical life had been the forbearance with which all political\r\nfactions restrained themselves from the use of violence. Such a\r\ncondition of affairs, however, no longer existed, and from the\r\nbeginning of the first century before Christ the use of force in\r\npolitical controversies at Rome became the rule rather than the\r\nexception. The exact reasons for the sudden change of sentiment upon\r\nthe part of the Roman mob against Saturninus is doubtful. It may have\r\nbeen solely on account of his advocacy of Italian suffrage, or it may\r\nhave been due to the belief by the mob in the accusation made by the\r\nsenators that Saturninus was seeking to make himself king.\r\n\r\nThe political history of Rome during the first quarter of the first\r\ncentury before Christ was extremely complicated on account of the\r\nexistence, side by side, of the two great contests,--the one between\r\nthe aristocratic party and the popular party at Rome; the second,\r\nbetween the Romans and the Italians. Both contests were from this time\r\non to be marked by the most extreme bitterness on both sides, and each\r\nsoon became a military rather than a political contest.\r\n\r\nThe complicated system of laws regulating the status of the citizens\r\nof the various Italian cities under the Roman republic has already\r\nbeen discussed in previous chapters. It is also to be noted that at an\r\nearlier date the political rights of a Roman citizen were of doubtful\r\nvalue and were often refused by Italian cities to which they were\r\noffered. This state of affairs no longer existed, and the time had\r\ncome when all Italians desired and demanded the political rights of\r\nthe Roman citizen.\r\n\r\nThe death of Saturninus and the departure of Marius for the East, in\r\n99 B.C., gave an opportunity for a new set of political leaders at\r\nRome. The first of these politicians to rise into prominence was M.\r\nLivius Drusus. Drusus occupied the unique position among the Roman\r\npoliticians of this period of having attempted to play the role of\r\nconciliator between the various conflicting factions. Originally\r\nbrought forward in political life by the senatorial party with the\r\nintention that he should play the part formerly taken by his father at\r\nthe time of the Gracchian conflicts, and destroy the influence of the\r\npopular leaders by outbidding them in their efforts for popular\r\nsupport--he soon went beyond the objects of his sponsors and\r\nendeavored to secure real reforms for the benefit of the people and of\r\nthe state. Some historians would rank Drusus as the best and ablest of\r\nall the Roman politicians who lived during the latter part of the\r\nrepublic. It is difficult, however, either to form an accurate opinion\r\nof the policies or merits of Drusus or to assign to him his proper\r\nniche in history. The accounts which we have of his political\r\nactivities are conflicting and fragmentary, and his work left few\r\npermanent results. The measure for which he is best remembered was\r\nhis proposed law to grant the franchise to the Latins and Italians.\r\nTogether with the increase of the franchise Drusus sought to secure\r\nthe allotment of land to the needy Roman citizens, and a reform in the\r\nmethod of administering justice and government in Rome.\r\n\r\nThe franchise law of Drusus secured for him unbounded popularity\r\nthroughout Italy and bitter opposition at Rome. This opposition in his\r\nown city culminated in his assassination in 91 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe murder of Drusus was the spark which produced the conflagration of\r\nthe Social War. Losing hope of securing any justice from Rome\r\nvoluntarily, ten of the Italian tribes, the Samnites, Trentanians,\r\nHirpini, Lucanians, Apulians, Picentines, Vestini, Marrucini,\r\nMarsians, and Pæligni banded themselves together and declared war\r\nagainst Rome. The Romans seemed to have been completely taken by\r\nsurprise. The Roman legates sent to the camp of the Italians were\r\nmurdered, together with all the Roman citizens upon whom the\r\ninsurgents could lay their hands, and a policy of extermination was\r\nresolved upon. Rome was to be destroyed, and Italy was to be made\r\ninto a great republic with Corfinium as its capital. The government of\r\nthe new republic was modeled after that of Rome. Marsian and Mutilus\r\nwere chosen consuls for the first year of the new Italian republic.\r\n\r\nThe war at first went against the Romans and for a while it seemed as\r\nif the Italians might even succeed in their scheme for the overthrow\r\nand the destruction of Rome. Again the Romans were obliged to look to\r\nGaius Marius for their safety. Marius, who shortly before this time\r\nhad returned from the East and who had been suffered to hold only a\r\nsubordinate command during the first year of the war, now being put in\r\ncontrol of one of the Roman armies turned the tide of the Italian\r\nsuccess by winning the first great victory achieved by the Romans\r\nduring the war. The sympathy of Marius, however, was so strongly with\r\nthe demands of the Italians, and his desires so great to bring the war\r\nto a close by conceding these demands, that he failed to follow up the\r\nsuccess with his accustomed vigor, with the result that a younger\r\ngeneral was enabled to rise into prominence.\r\n\r\nLucius Cornelius Sulla had already acquired considerable military\r\nreputation from the campaign which he had served in Africa under\r\nMarius, and was now in command of one of the Roman armies. Sulla,\r\nthroughout his whole life, was a consistent adherent of the extreme\r\noligarchical party. Nowhere in his life's history do we find the\r\nslightest degree of regard for popular rights, or any opposition to\r\ninjustice which might rest on the lower classes. With no sympathy for\r\nthe Italians or the cause which they represented, and possessed with\r\nmilitary ability almost equal to that of Marius, Sulla became the\r\nmilitary hero of the Social War. Nevertheless, it was soon evident\r\nthat the Romans themselves would not be able to bring the war to a\r\nsuccessful termination. Therefore, by the Julian Law, the Roman\r\nfranchise was extended to those tribes and cities in possession of the\r\nLatin rights, who, in return for the grant of the franchise to\r\nthemselves, seemed to have willingly assisted in preventing its\r\nacquisition by the others. With the aid of the Latins, Sulla was able\r\nto compel the subjugation of the Italians, of whom more than three\r\nhundred thousand are reported to have been killed in the short war.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of this war, however, brought not even a temporary\r\npeace. The Roman sky was overshadowed with clouds both of foreign\r\ninvasion and internal dissension. In the far East the great\r\nMithridates, king of Pontus, had defeated the Romans, murdered in cold\r\nblood eighty thousand Roman citizens whom he had found in Asia Minor,\r\nand was preparing to invade Greece, which was only too ready to rise\r\nand aid in the overthrow of the hated and oppressive Roman rule.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the battle of the Italians, lost in the field, was\r\nbeing renewed at Rome by the Roman politicians of the popular party.\r\nUnder the leadership of the tribune Sulpicius the popular party was\r\ninduced to take up the advocacy of the claims of the Italians.\r\n\r\nThe fear which had been produced in the minds of all Romans by the\r\ndisquieting news from the East tended to make all classes willing to\r\nconciliate the Italians, from whom soldiers for foreign service must\r\nmainly be recruited.\r\n\r\nBy the Lex Plautia-Popiria the very same privileges were extended to\r\nall the Italian allies of Rome that had been extended to a favored few\r\nby the Lex Julia. A few cities in Italy, however, mainly those of\r\nGrecian origin, declined to take advantage of this law, preferring to\r\nretain their local system of self-government rather than become\r\ncitizens of Rome.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of Roman supremacy the passage of the Lex\r\nPlautia-Popiria was the wisest action in the whole course of Roman\r\nhistory. The efforts of years immediately preceding the passage of\r\nthis act had shown that the citizenship of Rome, as constituted prior\r\nto the year 90 B.C., was far too limited to be able to long remain as\r\nthe base upon which the great pyramid of the Roman foreign possessions\r\nshould rest. Nevertheless, by the additions made by the Lex Julia and\r\nthe Lex Plautia-Popiria, it was rendered broad and strong enough to\r\nsustain the great weight and bulk of the Roman empire for several\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nThe Lex Plautia-Popiria, however, fell far short of giving to the\r\nItalians the full political influence to which their numbers would\r\nentitle them. The number of the new citizens enrolled by the censors\r\nunder the provisions of this new act were divided into eight (or\r\nperhaps ten) new tribes, instead of being divided among all the\r\nexisting thirty-five tribes as had been demanded by Sulpicius.\r\n\r\nThe passage of these laws, however, while it terminated one of the\r\ngreat contests between the Romans and Italians, did nothing toward\r\nterminating that between the oligarchical and the popular parties.\r\nDuring the period of the Social War the oligarchical and the popular\r\nparties in Rome had been by one common danger united against the\r\ncombined force of the Latins, but with the close of the war this union\r\nwas brought to an end. The popular party at Rome was augmented by the\r\nmasses of the Italians; while with the oligarchical party was\r\nassociated the aristocracy and nobles of the various Italian cities.\r\n\r\nThe contest at Rome soon flamed up again over the question as to whom\r\nthe command against Mithridates should be given. Again the question\r\nwas settled by force instead of by ballot, Sulla marching to Rome at\r\nthe head of his army, and Marius, to whom the command of the army had\r\nbeen given by the vote of the people, being obliged to flee for his\r\nlife. Many stories are told about the hairbreadth escapes of Marius at\r\nthis time. It is even related that, being captured in a marsh in\r\nCampania, he was taken before the magistrate at Minturnæ and a\r\nsentence of death passed upon him; that a Gaul was sent to his cell\r\nwith the command to cut off his head, but that the barbarian was so\r\nfrightened by the look in the eyes of Marius, which seemed to flash\r\nfire in the darkness of the cell, and by the awful tones in which the\r\nold man called out, \"Wretch, dare you slay Gaius Marius?\" that the\r\nGaul fled from the prison in dismay without executing his command, and\r\nthat Marius was afterwards released and succeeded in reaching Africa.\r\nIt is hardly possible, however, in view of the blood which flowed in\r\nRome at the command of Sulla, both at this time and a few years later\r\nupon his return from the East, that Marius would have succeeded in\r\nescaping death if he had, in reality, been captured by his opponents\r\nat this time.\r\n\r\nThe political situation in Rome was now in the condition where\r\npolitical supremacy depended upon force instead of upon the ballot;\r\nand the rule of the aristocratic party in Rome was destroyed by the\r\ndeparture of Sulla and his army for the East.\r\n\r\nThe consuls for the year 87 B.C. were Octavius, who belonged to the\r\naristocratic party, and Cornelius Cinna, the friend of Marius, who\r\nbelonged to the popular party. The latter attempted to once more bring\r\nforward the law for dividing the new Italian citizens among all the\r\ntribes of Rome, and was deprived of his consulship and exiled by the\r\noligarchy on this account. Civil war now again broke out in Rome, and\r\nthe city soon found herself threatened from all sides. At one time no\r\nless than four distinct and independent rebellious Roman armies were\r\nmarching against Rome, while the Samnites, always the most vindictive\r\nand irreconcilable enemies of Rome, again brought their forces in the\r\nfield--nominally to aid the popular party, in reality with the hope of\r\nbeing able to finally strike a blow against the very existence of\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nMarius, who had fled to Africa, returned to Italy and in connection\r\nwith Cinna put himself once more at the head of the popular party. No\r\nmilitary leader of the aristocratic party, capable of successfully\r\ncontending against the veteran leader of the popular party, remained\r\nin Italy, and once again the political wheel of fortune revolved in\r\nRome, leaving the oligarchical party at the mercy of Marius.\r\n\r\nHis recent experiences had embittered the old soldier, and aroused\r\nwithin him a desire for vengeance and for blood which he had never\r\nbefore exhibited in his long political and military life. In dramatic\r\nfashion he placed before the eyes of the Roman citizens the ungrateful\r\ntreatment which he had received in return for the great services he\r\nhad rendered his country. Clad in the ragged costume of an exile, he\r\nled his victorious army to Rome, and, saying with bitterness that \"an\r\nexile must not enter the city,\" he waited outside the walls of Rome\r\nuntil the decree of exile against him was formally repealed. If\r\nMarius, however, was scrupulous in his observation of the form of the\r\nlaws prior to his entrance into the city, all his regard for either\r\nthe form or substance of the law seems to have been lost after such\r\nentrance.\r\n\r\nMarius and Cinna declared themselves consuls of Rome for the year 86\r\nB.C. without any election and without even the formality of summoning\r\na meeting of the comitia tributa. Much more serious than this was the\r\ndisregard which was manifested by Marius and his followers for the\r\nlife and property of the Roman citizens. For several days Rome was\r\ngiven up to almost indiscriminate plunder and murder by the soldiers\r\nin the armies of Marius and Cinna; and after a stop was finally\r\nbrought to this extra-judicial pillage and murder it was succeeded by\r\na series of prosecutions almost as destructive, and fully as unjust.\r\n\r\nIt was with these days of slaughter, the most sanguinary and unjust of\r\nMarius's whole career, that his life was to end. He was now an old man\r\nof seventy, enfeebled by sickness and hardship, and after his desire\r\nfor vengeance on his enemies had been satisfied there appeared to him\r\nnothing left in life worth living for. Reports from the East indicated\r\nthe military triumph of his great rival Sulla, and the prospect of the\r\nspeedy return of the leader. To his other worries there was added the\r\nbelief that the present triumph of his party was but temporary.\r\nFinally, overcome by sickness and melancholy, he took to his bed, and\r\ndied at the end of seven days. Many believed that he had committed\r\nsuicide, but the truth of this theory can never be anything but a\r\nmatter of conjecture.\r\n\r\nOf the character of Marius little need be said. He was primarily a\r\nsoldier, and only incidentally a politician. The debt which Rome owed\r\nto the military ability of Marius can hardly be overestimated. It is\r\nprobable that but for his services the Roman republic might have been\r\ndestroyed on either of two different occasions.\r\n\r\nAs a politician Marius exerted little influence on the course of the\r\ndevelopment of Roman history. The part which he played was rather\r\nforced upon him by circumstances and the conditions of the times than\r\none which he himself created. His sympathies throughout were on the\r\nside of popular rights and equal justice. He supported the popular\r\nparty at Rome against the oligarchical party, and was one of the\r\nstrongest sympathizers with the Italians in their efforts for the\r\nRoman franchise. He was the first to draw the sword to protect the\r\nrights of the people against the oligarchy, but the members of the\r\noligarchy had themselves drawn it to overthrow the Gracchi, and force,\r\nhaving been entered into Roman politics, must be met with force,\r\nunless the people were willing to surrender all their claims to right\r\nand justice and permit the whole control of the state to pass to the\r\naristocracy.\r\n\r\nThe only real blemish upon the record of Marius is found in the cruel\r\nrevenge which he took upon his enemies in the last years of his life.\r\nEven on this occasion there was something more than mere revenge and\r\ncruelty in the policy of Marius. If the control of the popular party\r\nin Rome was to be permanent, it was necessary that the aristocratic\r\nparty should be completely crushed before the return of Sulla from the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\nIn concluding the career of Gaius Marius, summaries of his character\r\ngiven by two historians are here inserted:\r\n\r\n     \"'When Caius Gracchus fell,' said Mirabeau, 'he seized a\r\n     handful of dust tinged with his blood and flung it toward\r\n     the sky; from that dust was born Marius.' This phrase of\r\n     Mirabeau's, though a whit rhetorical, is historically true.\r\n     The patricians were willing to cede nothing to the Gracchi,\r\n     and they were decimated by Marius. The struggle changed its\r\n     methods: one fought no more with laws as the only weapons,\r\n     but yet more with proscriptions. Marius was the incarnated\r\n     pleb; as ignorant, pitiless, formidable, he had something of\r\n     Danton, except that Danton was no soldier.\" (J. J. Ampère,\r\n     _L'Empire romaine à Rome_.)\r\n\r\n     \"The judgment pronounced on Marius by posterity is not, like\r\n     that on many other eminent men, wavering and contradictory.\r\n     He is not one of those who to some have appeared heroes, to\r\n     others malefactors, nor has he had to wait for ages, like\r\n     Tiberius, before his true character became known.\r\n     Disregarding the conscious misrepresentations of his\r\n     personal enemies, we may say that he has always been taken\r\n     for a good specimen of the genuine old Roman, uniting in his\r\n     person in an exceptional degree the virtues and the faults\r\n     of the rude illiterate peasant and the intrepid soldier. No\r\n     one has ever ventured to deny that by his eminent military\r\n     ability he rendered essential service to his country. Nobody\r\n     has doubted his austere virtues, his simplicity and honesty,\r\n     qualities by which, no less than by his genius for war, he\r\n     gained for himself the veneration of the people. On the\r\n     other hand, it is universally admitted that as a politician\r\n     he was incompetent, and that he was only a tool in the hands\r\n     of those with whom he acted. But morbid ambition and\r\n     revengeful passion urged him at last to deeds which make it\r\n     doubtful whether it would not have been better for Rome if\r\n     he had never been born. He has, therefore, neither deserved\r\n     nor obtained unmixed admiration; but as his darkest deeds\r\n     were committed in moments when he was half mad from\r\n     sufferings and indignities he had endured, and when perhaps\r\n     he hardly knew what he was doing, he may, in the opinion of\r\n     humane judges, gain by comparison with Sulla, who acted from\r\n     reflection and in cool blood when he consigned thousands to\r\n     death and enacted the horrid spectacle of the\r\n     proscriptions.\" (William Ihne, _The History of Rome_.)\r\n\r\nMarius was succeeded as consul by Valerius Flaccus, who had held the\r\nsame office fourteen years before. The two consuls Cinna and Flaccus\r\nnow attempted to fulfill the pledges to the Italians, and censors were\r\nelected for the express purpose of doing away with the eight (or ten)\r\nnew Italian tribes and distributing the Italians throughout the whole\r\nthirty-five tribes.\r\n\r\nAnother important law passed at this time was in the nature of a\r\ntemporary bankruptcy law for the relief of the Roman debtors. By this\r\nnew law all debtors were enabled to clear themselves of their debts by\r\npaying one fourth of the amount owed.\r\n\r\nSulla, in the meantime, had brought to a successful close the war\r\nagainst Mithridates, although, on account of his anxiety to return to\r\nItaly as soon as possible, he did not completely crush the king of\r\nPontus, as he could have done easily at this time. Disregarding the\r\ndecree removing him from command of the army and appointing his\r\nsuccessor, Sulla retained the command of his victorious army and\r\nreturned with it to Italy, with the express purpose of crushing the\r\npopular party, and placed Rome once more completely under the control\r\nof the oligarchy.\r\n\r\nEven before starting for Italy Sulla had issued a manifesto which\r\nshowed that no mercy could be expected for his opponents in the event\r\nof his success. The Roman Senate at this crisis made a feeble effort\r\nto act as a mediator between the rival parties. It sent an embassy to\r\nendeavor to dissuade Sulla to desist from his threatened vengeance,\r\nwhile on the other hand it forbade the consuls to make any military\r\npreparations to resist. Both parties disregarded the orders of the\r\nSenate. Cinna and Carbo, who were at that time the consuls of Rome,\r\nbegan to make large levies of soldiers for the purpose of resisting\r\nSulla upon his return. An attempt by Cinna to lead an expedition to\r\nattack Sulla in the East was frustrated by the refusal of his soldiers\r\nto leave Italy, and Cinna himself was soon after murdered.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Cinna, Carbo for some time remained as the sole\r\nconsul of Rome. The worst possible use of this undivided power was\r\nmade by the consul at this period, and his terror at the approach of\r\nSulla was shown by the cruelty with which his enemies in the city were\r\nmurdered or exiled.\r\n\r\nSulla returned to Italy with only forty thousand soldiers, while the\r\npopular party, under Carbo and the younger Marius, a nephew of the\r\nveteran general, had secured an army said to have numbered two hundred\r\nthousand. The army of Sulla, however, was composed of trained\r\nveterans, and that of Carbo and Marius consisted, in the main, of\r\ninexperienced recruits.\r\n\r\nSoon after his return Sulla was joined by many of the senatorial\r\nparty, with large levies of soldiers. Among the most notable\r\naccessions to the army of Sulla was that led by Cneius Pompey, at that\r\ntime a youth of only twenty-three years of age but destined later to\r\nbe the great rival of Julius Cæsar for the first place in Roman\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nThe war from the start went against the popular party, and its final\r\noutcome can hardly be said to have been at any time doubtful, although\r\nit dragged along for some considerable time. The first important\r\nbattle was near Capua, in the year 83 B.C., where the consul Norbanus\r\nwas defeated by Sulla. The final fighting was around the city of\r\nPræneste, where all the generals of the popular party had made their\r\nheadquarters.\r\n\r\nAfter the strength of the Roman popular party had been crushed, the\r\nfighting was still kept up by the combined forces of the Samnites,\r\nLucanians, and Campanians, who, originally drawn into the war as\r\nallies of Carbo and Marius, now continued in a last desperate effort\r\nto overthrow Rome altogether. At the battle of the Colline Gate these\r\nallied Italian forces, under Pontius Telesinus, came very near\r\ninflicting a worse defeat upon Rome than this city had ever received.\r\nThe left wing of the Roman army, commanded by Sulla, was in fact\r\nrouted, and the battle was saved only by the right wing under the\r\ncommand of Crassus. In the end the victory of the Romans under Sulla\r\nin this battle was complete, and the great Italian general Pontius\r\nTelesinus was left dead upon the field.\r\n\r\nThis battle practically ended the fighting, although a few unimportant\r\ncities still held out against Sulla for a short period. The long\r\ncontest between the Romans and the Italians was now definitely over.\r\nThe victory of the oligarchical party at Rome over the popular party\r\nwas merely temporary, although the supremacy of the latter was never\r\nattacked during the lifetime of Sulla. The victory of Sulla was\r\nfollowed by the terrible proscriptions with which the name of this\r\ngeneral must ever be associated. The number of names appearing in the\r\nlist of those who were proscribed, and liable to be killed by any one\r\nwilling to carry out the orders of Sulla, reached the enormous total\r\nof forty-seven thousand. In this list were included most of the\r\nleaders of the popular party, all the personal enemies of Sulla\r\nhimself, and also the names of all those whom for any reason of\r\npersonal enmity or greed the friends of Sulla desired to have\r\nproscribed. It was only with the greatest difficulty that the friends\r\nof the young Julius Cæsar were able to save his life on this occasion.\r\nThere is an historic anecdote to the effect that Sulla, in sparing\r\nhim, warned the aristocratic party to beware of him in the future, as\r\nin this young man there was more than one Marius. It is hardly\r\nprobable that this story is true, as Cæsar at this time had done\r\nnothing to show his ability.\r\n\r\nThe vengeance which Sulla took upon the Italians who had resisted him\r\nwas even more terrible. Whole cities were destroyed, and the Samnite\r\nrace was practically annihilated. The vengeance of Sulla extended even\r\nto the remote provinces, where the members of the popular party were\r\neverywhere hunted down and murdered.\r\n\r\nIn the year 81 B.C. the dictatorship, which had been unknown in the\r\nRoman government for considerably more than a century, was once more\r\nresorted to, and by the means of this office Sulla obtained absolute\r\npower at Rome. The legal changes made by Sulla were few, but all in\r\nfavor of the aristocratic party. The laws passed during the previous\r\nhalf century in favor of the people were disregarded. The presidency\r\nof the courts was limited to the nobility, and the jurymen were again\r\ntaken from the senators. Sulla also secured the passage of a large\r\nnumber of sumptuary laws of the most minute and, it might be added, of\r\nthe most ridiculous character.\r\n\r\nBecause of poor health, Sulla was compelled, in the year 79 B.C., to\r\nresign the dictatorship, and he died the following year at the age of\r\nsixty.\r\n\r\nTo such minds as naturally incline to the democratic side of political\r\ncontroversies, whether past or present, the character of Sulla will be\r\napt to appear as perhaps that character in all Roman history most\r\nabsolutely without a redeeming trait.\r\n\r\nSulla's military triumphs consisted in the reconquest of provinces\r\nwhich had been goaded into rebellion by the terrible exactions of the\r\nRoman tax collectors and the unspeakable atrocities of the Roman slave\r\nhunters.\r\n\r\nThe historians of the reactionary and aristocratic school, while they\r\nare able to find much to praise in the life and work of this bitterest\r\nof the enemies of human lives and liberty, are nevertheless compelled\r\nto qualify their praise because of the many features of his character\r\nand the many acts of his life which even they are compelled to\r\ncondemn. The historian Charles Merivale has made perhaps as strong a\r\nplea for Sulla as it is possible to make, in the following words:\r\n\r\n     \"The personal rivalry of her two most fortunate generals\r\n     becomes now the main channel of the history of Rome herself.\r\n     In the year which closed the contest of the republic with\r\n     her dependent allies (88), Sulla was forty-nine years old,\r\n     Marius was about seventy. The former was enjoying the full\r\n     breeze of popularity and renown, while the latter, wearied\r\n     but not sated with accumulated honours, was moodily throwing\r\n     away the advantages he had earned in his earlier career.\r\n     From campaign to campaign Sulla, as we have seen, had dogged\r\n     the steps of the elder warrior, always ready to step in and\r\n     seize the opportunities which the other cast recklessly in\r\n     his way. Not that Marius in his exalted station was even\r\n     from the first indifferent to this incipient rivalry. He was\r\n     deeply jealous of his subordinate. He felt chagrin at the\r\n     contrast presented by their respective birth and origin; for\r\n     Sulla, though needy in point of fortune, was a scion of the\r\n     illustrious house of the Cornelii, and plumed himself on the\r\n     distinction and advantage such a lineage conferred. Sulla,\r\n     moreover, was trained in the accomplishments of Hellenic\r\n     education, which Marius, conscious of his want of them,\r\n     vainly affected to despise. Sulla wrote and spoke Greek; his\r\n     memoirs of his own life became the text-book of the Greek\r\n     historians of Rome, from whom we principally derive our\r\n     acquaintance with him. But this varnish of superior culture\r\n     seems to have failed in softening a rough plebeian nature.\r\n     Sulla was one of many noble Romans who combined with\r\n     pretensions to literary taste the love of gross debauchery,\r\n     and pleasure in the society of mimes and vulgar jesters. He\r\n     was a coarse sensualist, and by his disregard of the nuptial\r\n     tie offended even the lax morality of his age. His eyes, we\r\n     are told, were of a pure and piercing blue, and their\r\n     sinister expression was heightened by the coarseness of his\r\n     complexion and a countenance disfigured by pimples and\r\n     blotches, compared by the raillery of the Greeks to a\r\n     mulberry sprinkled with meal. His manners, except when he\r\n     unbent in the society of his inferiors, were haughty and\r\n     morose; nor is there any act of kindliness or generosity\r\n     recorded of him. The nobles who accepted him as their\r\n     champion had no personal liking for him. But selfish and\r\n     ambitious though he was, the aggrandisement of his party and\r\n     order was with Sulla a species of fanaticism. He despised\r\n     the isolated ascendency of a Marius, and aspired to rule in\r\n     Rome at the head of a dominant oligarchy....\r\n\r\n     \"Slowly and with many a painful struggle the Roman\r\n     commonwealth had outgrown the narrow limits of a rustic\r\n     municipality. The few hundred families which formed the\r\n     original nucleus of her citizenship, and which in her\r\n     earliest and simplest days had sufficed to execute all the\r\n     functions of her government, had been compelled to\r\n     incorporate allies and rivals in their own body, to enlarge\r\n     their views, and to expand their institutions. The main\r\n     object of Sulla's policy was to revive at least the spirit\r\n     of the old restrictions. The old families themselves had\r\n     perished almost to a man; he replaced them by a newer\r\n     growth; but he strove to pare away the accretions of ages,\r\n     and restore the government of the vast empire of Rome to a\r\n     small section of her children. It contravened the essential\r\n     principle of national growth; while the career of conquest,\r\n     to which the Romans devoted themselves, required the most\r\n     perfect freedom of development.\r\n\r\n     \"Nevertheless the legislation of Sulla was undoubtedly\r\n     supported by a vast mass of existing prejudice. He threw\r\n     himself into the ideas of his time, as far as they were\r\n     interpreted by history, by tradition, and by religious\r\n     usage. The attempt to enlarge the limits of the constitution\r\n     was in fact opposed to every acknowledged principle of\r\n     polity. It was regarded equally by its opponents and its\r\n     promoters as anomalous and revolutionary. It had as yet no\r\n     foundation in argument, or in any sense of right, as right\r\n     was then understood. Society at Rome was in a highly\r\n     artificial state; and Sulla, with many of his ablest\r\n     contemporaries, mistook for the laws of nature the\r\n     institutions of an obsolete and forgotten expediency. But\r\n     nature was carrying on a great work, and proved too strong\r\n     for art. Ten years sufficed to overthrow the whole structure\r\n     of this reactionary legislation, and to launch the republic\r\n     once more upon the career of growth and development. The\r\n     champions of a more liberal policy sprang up in constant\r\n     succession, and contributed, perhaps unconsciously, to the\r\n     great work of union and comprehension, which was now rapidly\r\n     in progress. The spirit of isolation which had split Greece\r\n     and Italy into hundreds of separate communities was about to\r\n     give way to a general yearning for social and moral unity.\r\n     The nations were to be trained by the steady development of\r\n     the Roman administration.\r\n\r\n     \"But though Sulla's main policy was thus speedily\r\n     overthrown, he had not lived in vain. As dictator he wasted\r\n     his strength in attempting what, if successful, would have\r\n     destroyed his country; but as proconsul he has saved her.\r\n     The tyranny of the Roman domination had set the provinces in\r\n     a blaze. Mithridates had fanned the flame. Greece and Asia\r\n     had revolted. The genius of the king of Pontus might have\r\n     consolidated an empire, such as Xerxes might have envied, on\r\n     either shore of the Ægean Sea. But at this crisis of her\r\n     fate, hardly less imminent than when Hannibal was wresting\r\n     from her allies and subjects within the Alps, Rome had\r\n     confided her fortunes to the prowess of Sulla. The great\r\n     victory of Chæronea checked the dissolution of her empire.\r\n     The invader was hurled back across the Ægean; the cities of\r\n     Greece returned reluctantly to their obedience, never more\r\n     to be tempted to renounce it. Sulla followed Mithridates\r\n     into Asia; one by one he recovered the provinces of the\r\n     republic. He bound his foe by treaties to abstain from\r\n     fomenting their discontents. He left his officers to enforce\r\n     submission to his decrees, and quartered the armies of Rome\r\n     upon the wretched populations of the East. The pressing\r\n     danger of the moment was averted, though it took twenty\r\n     years more to subdue the power of Mithridates, and reduce\r\n     Asia to passive submission. Rome was relieved from the last\r\n     of her foreign invaders; and this was the great work of\r\n     Sulla, which deserved to immortalise his name in her\r\n     annals.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nPOMPEY\r\n\r\n\r\nSulla had hoped by his proscriptions to so completely crush the\r\npopular party in Rome that the aristocratic party would be able to\r\nenjoy a long period of undisputed authority and absolute power. Hardly\r\nwas Sulla buried, however, before the popular party began to show\r\nsigns of life and renewed resistance. The consuls at the time of\r\nSulla's death were Lepidus and Catulus, both of them elected on\r\naccount of their supposed absolute loyalty to the policies of Sulla\r\nand their disregard of popular rights. The first named, however, soon\r\nbegan to manifest symptoms of justice and humanity, and the Senate,\r\nalarmed at these views and his increasing popularity, sought to remove\r\nhim from participation in Roman politics by sending him as proconsul\r\nto govern the (then considered) remote province of Cisalpine Gaul.\r\nThis move only strengthened the position of Lepidus, however, by\r\nproviding him with an army. This army being augmented by recruits\r\nconsisting partly of enthusiastic adherents of the popular cause and\r\npartly of desperate adventurers, Lepidus considered himself strong\r\nenough to brave the chances of war, and began a march toward Rome. His\r\narmy, however, was intercepted by the senatorial army sent to meet\r\nhim, and Lepidus, completely defeated, fled to Sardinia, where he soon\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nOne of the leading lieutenants of Lepidus in this campaign was Brutus,\r\nthe father of the Brutus who was to be one of the assassins of Julius\r\nCæsar. The elder Brutus was taken prisoner at this time and put to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime another rebellion broke out in Spain, where Sertorius\r\nhad assumed the government. Neither Metellus nor Pompey was able to\r\nreduce him to submission, and the rebellion was put to an end only by\r\nthe murder of Sertorius in 72 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe epoch of civil wars had now fully begun for Rome, and the same\r\nyear which witnessed the murder of Sertorius saw also the breaking out\r\nof the rebellion of the gladiators under Spartacus. This rebellion,\r\nstarting in the mere uprising of a handful of gladiators, reached very\r\nlarge proportions and occasioned the greatest fear at Rome before it\r\nwas put down by Crassus in the south of Italy and Pompey in the north.\r\nThe credit for putting down this insurrection clearly belonged to\r\nCrassus rather than to Pompey, whose share in the work had been merely\r\nthe destruction of a band of fugitives who had fled to the north of\r\nItaly. Nevertheless, the Senate gave the highest honors to Pompey, who\r\nwas voted a triumph, while only an ovation was granted to Crassus.\r\n\r\nPompey and Crassus both sought election to the consulship, although\r\nboth were ineligible, since Crassus was still a prætor and under the\r\nlaws should have waited two years before being a candidate for consul,\r\nand Pompey was only thirty-five years old and had not even been\r\nquæstor. Each of the candidates, however, had an army under his\r\ncontrol at the very gates of Rome, and the two illegal elections were\r\nsecured from the people by fear. Pompey and Crassus, the two most\r\npowerful men in Rome at this time, were thus consuls together in the\r\nyear 70 B.C.\r\n\r\nPompey, although he had been an ardent supporter of Sulla and a great\r\nfavorite of this leader, nevertheless, upon his election as consul,\r\nbegan to depart from Sulla's policies. The proposals made by Pompey\r\nwere the removal of the restrictions placed upon the tribunes by Sulla\r\nand a reform of the judicial system. The first proposal was consented\r\nto by the Senate after some slight protest, but the second met with\r\nbitter opposition. The complete control possessed by the Senate over\r\nthe law courts was of such great value to them that they were\r\ndetermined to retain it, although the administration of the courts\r\nwhile under their control had been one long-continued scandal. The\r\nadministration of justice under the knights, however, had been almost\r\nas corrupt as that of the Senate, and to avoid giving the complete\r\ncontrol of the trials to either of these orders, the new law prepared\r\nby Pompey and proposed by the prætor urbanus Aurelius Cotta provided\r\nthat one third of the jurymen should be furnished by the Senate, one\r\nthird by the knights, and one third by the tribunes of the treasury.\r\nIt was evident that the law was popular and would be adopted if it\r\ncame to a vote. To prevent this, the senatorial party again prepared\r\nto engage in civil war. On this occasion, however, the resistance of\r\nthe Senate was broken by the result of the still famous Verres trial.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this trial it is necessary to go back and speak of\r\nthe work of another of the great men in the new generation of Roman\r\npoliticians. As early as the year 79 B.C. Cicero had won considerable\r\nreputation by his defense of Sextius Roscius. From 77 B.C. down to the\r\nperiod of which we are now writing Cicero had been actively engaged in\r\nthe work of an advocate at Rome, except during the single year 75\r\nB.C., when he served as a quæstor in Sicily, and during this period\r\nhad risen in his profession until his reputation in the courts was\r\nsecond only to that of the greatest lawyer of the age, Hortensius.\r\n\r\nCicero was now a candidate for ædile and tried to aid his candidacy by\r\nsome signal achievements. Just at this time a number of the Sicilians,\r\nto whom Cicero had endeared himself by the honesty and ability with\r\nwhich he had exercised his duty as quæstor in their island, besought\r\nCicero to undertake the prosecution of C. Cornelius Verres, who had\r\njust returned from three years' service as prætor in Sicily, in which\r\nprovince he had been guilty of the most extreme extortions,\r\ndishonesty, and cruelty. The evidence Cicero was able to produce\r\nagainst Verres, and the impassioned eloquence of the orations against\r\nhim which he prepared (for the evidence against Verres was so\r\nunanswerable that his counsel, the great Hortensius, threw up the\r\ncase, and Verres fled into exile, thus depriving Cicero of an\r\nopportunity of delivering all the carefully prepared speeches orally\r\nin court) so demoralized the senatorial party that opposition to\r\nCotta's bill now ceased, and the law was passed without further\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, 70 B.C., censors were again appointed, after the\r\noffice had been suspended for sixteen years, and the corruption of the\r\ntimes, and particularly of the Senate, was shown by the fact that by\r\nthe action of the censors sixty-four members of the Senate were\r\ndegraded from their office.\r\n\r\nThe greatest military triumphs in the life of Pompey were in the years\r\nfollowing his consulship. In 67 B.C. he was sent to subdue the\r\nSicilian pirates, armed with more complete powers than had ever before\r\nbeen voluntarily given by Roman citizens to any Roman general.\r\n\r\n     \"The terms of the proposal are extraordinary, and require\r\n     close attention. First, a generalissimo was to be appointed\r\n     by the senate from the consulars, to hold supreme command\r\n     over the whole Mediterranean and over all the coast for\r\n     fifty miles inland, concurrently with the ordinary\r\n     governors, for three years. Second, he might select from the\r\n     men of senatorial rank twenty-five lieutenants with\r\n     prætorian powers, and two treasurers with questorian power.\r\n     Third, he might raise an army of 120,000 infantry and 7,000\r\n     cavalry, and a fleet of 500 ships, and for this purpose\r\n     might dispose absolutely of all the resources of the\r\n     provinces. Besides this, a large sum of money and a\r\n     considerable force of men and ships were at once handed over\r\n     to him.\r\n\r\n     \"By the introduction of this law the government was\r\n     practically taken out of the hands of the senate; it was the\r\n     final collapse of the oligarchic rule. But it was more than\r\n     this--it was practically the institution of an unlimited\r\n     dictatorship.\r\n\r\n     \"Like all extraordinary commands, this new office no doubt\r\n     required the confirmation of the people; but it was an\r\n     undoubted prerogative of the senate to define the sphere of\r\n     every command, and, in fact, to control and limit it in all\r\n     ways. The people had hitherto interfered only on the\r\n     proposition of the senate, or at any rate of a magistrate\r\n     himself qualified for the office of general. Even during the\r\n     Jugurthine War, when the command was transferred to Marius\r\n     by popular vote, it was only to Marius as consul for the\r\n     year. But now a private man was to be invested by the tribes\r\n     with extraordinary authority, and the sphere of his office\r\n     was defined by themselves. The new commander was empowered\r\n     to confer prætorian powers--that is, the highest military\r\n     and civil authority--upon adjutants chosen by himself,\r\n     though hitherto such authority could only be conferred with\r\n     the coöperation of the burgesses; while the office of\r\n     general, which was usually conferred for one year only, with\r\n     strict limitations as to forces and supplies, was now\r\n     committed almost without reserve to one man, who could draw\r\n     upon the whole resources of the state.\r\n\r\n     \"Thus at one stroke the government was taken out of the\r\n     hands of the senate, and the fortunes of the empire\r\n     committed for the next three years to a dictator.\"\r\n\r\nThe passage of this measure was one of the greatest triumphs in the\r\nlife of Pompey. The success of Pompey against the pirates was complete\r\nand immediate, and appeared in striking contrast with the ill-success\r\nwhich had attended the Roman armies in Asia during the previous few\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIn 66 B.C. Gaius Manilius, one of the tribunes, introduced a bill\r\nrecalling the Roman generals then conducting the war in Asia Minor and\r\ntransferring the control of the Roman armies in this section to\r\nPompey, giving also to Pompey the full power to make peace and\r\nalliances. This proposed law brought about a most peculiar condition\r\nof affairs in Roman politics. Few, if any, truly favored the\r\nprocedure, which was in direct violation of all the principles of the\r\nRoman constitution--a greater violation even than the law which had\r\nconferred upon Pompey his extraordinary powers as proconsul of the\r\nseas. But while everybody feared the passage of this law, everybody,\r\nwith the exception of the extreme aristocratic party led by Catulus,\r\nfeared more to oppose it, and the law was passed with little\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nFrom a military standpoint this grant of power to Pompey was justified\r\nby the results. Inside of three years he succeeded in completely\r\noverthrowing both Mithridates, the old king of Pontus, Rome's most\r\ndreaded enemy, and Tigranes, the king of Armenia. These successes of\r\nPompey were followed by the conquest of the greater part of Syria.\r\nFrom the conquests of Pompey in the East four new Roman provinces were\r\nformed: (1) Pontus and Bithynia; (2) Cilicia, including Isauria and\r\nPamphylia; (3) Syria; (4) Crete.\r\n\r\nThe demoralizing effect of these laws conferring such powers upon\r\nPompey were soon to manifest themselves. Rome was rapidly becoming\r\naccustomed to the disregard of the forms of government and of law, and\r\nto the sight of vast and irresponsible powers being granted to a\r\nsingle individual. These were the two things needed to prepare Rome to\r\nquietly acquiesce in the abandonment of the republic and the creation\r\nof a despotism. There is never a time in any country where too great a\r\nresponsibility or power can be given to a single individual without\r\nthe greatest danger to the future of the country. The right of the\r\npeople to rule is both meaningless and valueless if such right is\r\nmerely to consist in the right to delegate all the duties and powers\r\nof government to the custody of a single individual. A government can\r\ncontinue free only where the active control of public affairs is\r\nwidely distributed, and where the masses of the people are not afraid\r\nto accept responsibility and do not attempt to throw the\r\nresponsibility for their safety and welfare upon the shoulders of a\r\nsingle individual. Where a single individual becomes indispensable to\r\nany free people it is a sign of the degeneracy of the people rather\r\nthan of the greatness of the man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nCICERO AND CATILINE\r\n\r\n\r\nPolitical honors under the Roman republic were generally to be won\r\nonly by military success, or by aggressive leadership in the factional\r\npolitics of the city. The single instance of a man's rise to a leading\r\nplace in Roman politics solely through the power of his oratory is\r\nfound in the case of Marcus Tullius Cicero. His success in the defense\r\nof Roscius and in the prosecution of Verres, as well as his growing\r\nreputation as a lawyer and orator, have already been referred to.\r\n\r\nIn 65 B.C. Cicero was a successful candidate for the consulship. His\r\nletters written to his friend Atticus at Athens, during his campaign,\r\ngive a most vivid insight into the practical Roman politics of the\r\ntimes, and show us the striking similarity, in many respects, between\r\nthe political battles of the Roman republic and our own election\r\ncontests.\r\n\r\nIn one of his early letters Cicero wrote: \"Let me tell you that there\r\nis no class of people so harassed by every kind of unreasonable\r\ndifficulty as candidates for office.\"\r\n\r\nIn a later letter he discusses the details of his campaign as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"The state of things in regard to my candidature, in which I\r\n     know that you are supremely interested, is this, as far as\r\n     can be as yet conjectured. The only person actually\r\n     canvassing is P. Sulpicius Galba. He meets with a good\r\n     old-fashioned refusal without reserve or disguise. In the\r\n     general opinion this premature canvass of his is not\r\n     unfavorable to my interests; for the voters generally give\r\n     as a reason for their refusal that they are under\r\n     obligations to me. So I hope my prospects are to a certain\r\n     degree improved by the report getting about that my friends\r\n     are found to be numerous. My intention was to begin my own\r\n     canvass just at the very time that Cincius tells me that\r\n     your servant starts with this letter, namely, in the campus\r\n     at the time of the tribunician election, on the 17th of\r\n     July. My fellow candidates, to mention only those who seem\r\n     certain, are Galba and Antonius, and Q. Cornificius. At this\r\n     I imagine you smiling or sighing. Well, to make you\r\n     positively smite your forehead, there are people who\r\n     actually think that Cæsonius will stand. I do not think\r\n     Aquitius will, for he openly disclaims it and has alleged as\r\n     an excuse his health and his leading position at the bar.\r\n     Catiline will certainly be a candidate, if you can imagine a\r\n     jury finding that the sun does not shine at noon. As for\r\n     Aufidius and Policanus, I do not think you will expect to\r\n     hear from me about them. Of the candidates for this year's\r\n     election, Cæsar is considered certain. Thermus is looked\r\n     upon as the rival of Silanus. These latter are so weak both\r\n     in friends and reputation that it seems possible to me to\r\n     bring in Curius over both. But no one else seems to think\r\n     so. What seems most to my interests is that Thermus should\r\n     get in with Cæsar. For there is none of those at present\r\n     canvassing who, if left over to my year, seems likely to be\r\n     a stronger candidate, from the fact that he is commissioner\r\n     of the via Flaminia, and when that has been finished I shall\r\n     be greatly relieved to have seen him elected consul this\r\n     election. Such in outline is the position of affairs in\r\n     regard to candidates up to date. For myself I shall take the\r\n     greatest pains to carry out all the duties of a candidate,\r\n     and perhaps, as Gaul seems to have a considerable voting\r\n     power, as soon as business at Rome has come to a standstill\r\n     I shall obtain a _libera legatio_ and make an excursion in\r\n     the course of September to visit Piso, but so as not to be\r\n     back later than January. When I have ascertained the\r\n     feelings of the nobility, I shall let you know. You must\r\n     undertake to secure for me the support of our friend Pompey,\r\n     since you are nearer to him than I. Tell him I shall not be\r\n     annoyed if he does not come to my election.\"\r\n\r\nThe year of Cicero's consulship (64 B.C.) was disturbed by the famous\r\nconspiracy of Lucius Sergius Catiline. It was in this conspiracy, and\r\nduring this consulship, that the culmination was reached of the\r\ndiscontent and plotting which had been fermenting at Rome for a\r\nnumber of years among a large class of the Roman nobility. The most\r\ndiscontented men in any community are generally to be found among\r\nthose who, while belonging by birth to the upper classes of society,\r\nand accustomed to and desirous of the luxuries of life, have lost\r\ntheir fortunes and are unable to live in the style to which they\r\nconsider themselves as of right entitled. Rome, at this time, was\r\nfilled with this class of malcontents, the extravagant and wasteful\r\nstyle of living, combined with the reckless gambling of the age,\r\nhaving reduced great numbers among the young nobles almost to beggary.\r\n\r\nThe overthrow of Sulla's system of government, resulting from the\r\ndefection of Pompey and the consequential loss of power and prestige\r\nby the Senate, had also roused a bitter feeling of resentment among\r\nthe whole aristocratic party. The effect of this resentment upon the\r\nmore solid and substantial element of this party had been to lead them\r\nto make preparations for the overthrow of Pompey upon his return to\r\nRome; while the effect upon the ruined young nobles was to render\r\nthem more than ever ready for any desperate undertaking by which they\r\nstood a chance of repairing their fortunes.\r\n\r\nNo cause, whether good or bad, ever lacks a leader; and the leader at\r\nthis time was found in Catiline, a young noble of the most profligate\r\ncharacter, but of some degree of ability and possessed of boundless\r\naudacity and ambition.\r\n\r\nCatiline was descended from one of the oldest families in Rome, and\r\nhis loyalty to the cause of the aristocracy was proved by the ferocity\r\nwith which he had served under Sulla and had assisted in carrying into\r\nexecution his most bloodthirsty orders. Catiline did not fail to\r\nderive some profit from these terrible times, as he secured the\r\nproscription and murder of his brother and the grant to himself of his\r\nbrother's forfeited estate.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these and many other equally heinous crimes, Catiline had\r\nbeen elected prætor in 68 B.C. and had then spent two years in the\r\ngovernment of Africa. Returning to Rome in 66 B.C., he at once offered\r\nhimself as a candidate for the consulship. His political hopes on this\r\noccasion, however, were wrecked by an accusation of misconduct in the\r\ngovernment of his province, brought against him by Publius Clodius. In\r\nrevenge, Catiline then conspired with Autronius Pætus, who had just\r\nbeen deprived of the consulship for bribery, and other profligate and\r\nreckless nobles, to murder Cotta and Manilius, the successful\r\ncandidates for consul, and to seize the government. According to\r\nrumor, both Crassus and Cæsar were connected with the conspiracy. The\r\nconspiracy was discovered and the enterprise was abandoned; but the\r\nproceedings against the suspected conspirators were stopped by the\r\ninterposition of one of the tribunes, and the facts of the matter were\r\nnever definitely ascertained.\r\n\r\nIt is a peculiar fact that Cicero was ready, at this time, to defend\r\nCatiline against the charges of Clodius; which charges, however, were\r\ndropped, without being brought to trial. Two years later, Catiline was\r\nagain a candidate for consul, but was defeated by Cicero and Antonius.\r\nCatiline now began to make preparations for civil war. The plot was\r\nbetrayed by a woman. Curius, one of Catiline's adherents, boasted of\r\nthe plot to his mistress Fulvia, and she not only gave information of\r\nthe plot to Cicero but entered into his employ as a spy upon the\r\nconspirators.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the overwhelming character of the evidence against him,\r\nCatiline continued on his course with the utmost assurance and\r\ninsolence. He even took his place in the Senate, and upon being\r\nattacked by Cicero replied, \"There are two parties in the\r\ncommonwealth; the nobles, weak in both head and body; the people,\r\nstrong in body, but headless. I intend to supply this body with a\r\nhead.\"\r\n\r\nOn the seventh of November Catiline attempted the assassination of\r\nCicero by two of his adherents, C. Cornelius and L. Vargunteius.\r\nCicero was immediately informed of this attempt by his spies, and the\r\nattempt was blocked. The following day Cicero summoned a meeting of\r\nthe Senate, and upon Catiline appearing in his place, Cicero burst out\r\nin the first of those famous orations against Catiline, so well known\r\nto all Latin students, which begins: \"How long, O Catiline, will you\r\nthus abuse our patience? To what end will your unrestrained audacity\r\ndisplay itself?\"\r\n\r\nIt is always one of the most difficult of tasks to persuade the\r\ncitizens of any republic that any political leader is actually\r\nplanning the overthrow of the republican form of government. This\r\nblindness, not restricted to any one race or age, was so dense at this\r\ntime in Rome that many people had refused to believe even in the\r\nexistence of the conspiracy of Catiline, and had suspected Cicero of\r\nhaving invented the whole story with the object of making political\r\ncapital for himself.\r\n\r\nThe fierce fire in the Senate of the oration by Cicero against\r\nCatiline, however, proved sufficient to force Catiline to action; and\r\nthe night after Cicero's first oration against him Catiline fled to\r\nTuscany to join the forces which had been collected there under his\r\nlieutenant Manlius. Catiline, keeping up his deceit and duplicity to\r\nthe end, even while en route to the army of the conspirators wrote\r\nletters to Rome declaring that he was the victim of a conspiracy and\r\nthat his present purpose was to go into voluntary banishment at\r\nMarseilles.\r\n\r\nUpon reaching his army Catiline threw off the mask and prepared to\r\ntake active steps for the overthrow and destruction of Rome. The\r\nconspiracy had now passed the point where it was merely intended to\r\noverthrow the duly elected Roman officials, and to install Catiline\r\nand his friends in their places; the conspirators now sought nothing\r\nless atrocious than the sack of Rome and the murder of her wealthiest\r\ncitizens. The contest had now become one directed against the rich\r\nclass of the nobles by the poor and bankrupt members of the same\r\norder, assisted by all the unprincipled and desperate adventurers of\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nThe plans of Catiline and his supporters were that the army in Tuscany\r\nshould march upon Rome, while the friends of Catiline in the city\r\nshould watch for a favorable opportunity to murder the consuls and set\r\nfire to the city.\r\n\r\nTo meet this two-sided danger Antonius was sent with an army against\r\nCatiline, while Cicero remained in Rome to secure the safety of the\r\ncity. Cicero was the first to complete his part of the work. The\r\nuntiring efforts of the consul at length resulted in securing legal\r\nproof against the leading conspirators who had remained at Rome, and\r\nthese were immediately arrested and brought to trial. The people were\r\nat length convinced of the truth of the conspiracy, but even now it\r\nwas only with the greatest difficulty that Cicero was able to have\r\nthe death sentence decreed against the prisoners.\r\n\r\nCatiline now attempted to retreat into Gaul, but was pursued by\r\nAntonius, and in the battle which ensued the army of Catiline was cut\r\nto pieces and Catiline himself killed.\r\n\r\nCicero had earned the gratitude of Rome by preserving it from its\r\nthreatened destruction at the hands of Catiline; but the rest of his\r\nrecord as consul was not of a very creditable character. Throughout\r\nhis year of office Cicero was the consistent champion of the\r\nsenatorial party, and the opponent of all measures to improve the\r\neconomic conditions of the people. In particular, Cicero is to be\r\ncensured for his opposition to the agrarian law proposed at this time.\r\nCicero was also largely responsible for the defeat of a bill to\r\nrestore the right of citizenship to the children of the men who had\r\nbeen proscribed by Sulla.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nJULIUS CÆSAR\r\n\r\n\r\nIt now remains to relate the life history of the man by whom the\r\nrepublican form of government at Rome was fated to be finally\r\noverthrown. That the existence of this Roman republic was doomed, that\r\ndemocratic or oligarchical government must give way either to anarchy\r\nor despotism, had been certain ever since the refusal of the Roman\r\ncitizens to support the attempted reforms of the Gracchi.\r\n\r\nThere is no greater obstacle to the complete success of popular\r\ngovernment than the almost inexplicable tendency of the majority of\r\nmen to crucify the true reformer and conscientious lover of humanity\r\nas a disturber of, and a menace to, society, and to heap honors upon\r\nthe head of the selfish, unprincipled, egotistical, and vicious\r\ndemagogue. The result is that the reforms which might save the country\r\nfail; and later the people, at last roused to a realization of the\r\nevils which surround them, grasp at the promises of the imposter and\r\nfollow him with hysterical and insane enthusiasm until their false\r\nleader directs their footsteps to the precipice, over which they fall\r\nto their destruction. If France had adopted the moderate reforms of\r\nNecker and Turgot she might have been saved from the terrible\r\nretribution of the French Revolution; if Rome had not rejected the\r\nleadership of Tiberius Gracchus, and later accepted that of Julius\r\nCæsar, the Roman republic need not have fallen.\r\n\r\nJulius Cæsar was born in the year 100 B.C. His family were of old\r\npatrician stock, and in addition were possessed of considerable\r\nwealth, but the share that was inherited by young Julius was very\r\nquickly squandered. From the outset of his career Cæsar exhibited\r\ntalents of a widely diversified character, showing literary ability as\r\nwell as strength and skill in athletic exercises and in military life.\r\nWith all these Cæsar combined a dissipated character, and extreme\r\nselfish ambition. Cæsar, by the accidental course of events, became\r\nallied with the popular party at Rome; but throughout his whole life\r\nit was with him merely a case of using the popular favor as a means to\r\npromote his personal ends; never a case of sacrificing himself, his\r\nambition, or his pleasure for the people's welfare. It was by\r\nmarriage that Cæsar had become connected with the popular party, his\r\naunt Julia having become the wife of Marius, while he himself had\r\nmarried the daughter of Cinna, the colleague of Marius in his last\r\nconsulship. On account of these marriage relations Cæsar barely\r\nescaped being included in the proscriptions of Sulla. He finally\r\nsucceeded in making his peace with Sulla, and received his first\r\nmilitary experience under Thermus, whom Sulla had left to besiege\r\nMitylene. In this campaign young Cæsar distinguished himself by\r\nwinning a civic crown for saving the life of a citizen. After the\r\ndeath of Sulla Cæsar made his first attempt to attract attention in\r\nthe political field by impeaching Dolabella for extortion in his\r\nadministration in Macedonia. Although Dolabella was acquitted, Cæsar\r\nacquired some reputation from this affair.\r\n\r\nThis trial persuaded Cæsar that he should take up the field of\r\noratory, and he accordingly set out to study rhetoric at Rhodes under\r\nMolo, the great teacher in this subject at that time. On his way,\r\nCæsar underwent the second great peril of his life by being captured\r\nby Cilician pirates. After being ransomed he abandoned the idea of\r\nstudying rhetoric, and instead fitted up an expedition with which he\r\ncaptured his former captors, whom he crucified at Pergamus. In 74 B.C.\r\nCæsar was elected one of the pontifices at Rome, and immediately\r\nreturned to the city, where he spent several years in ease and\r\npleasure, not neglecting, however, to use every effort to win the\r\nfavor of the populace.\r\n\r\nCæsar was elected quæstor in 68 B.C., and it was during his year in\r\nthis office that he made his first bold play to secure the popular\r\nsupport. His aunt Julia, the widow of Marius, dying, Cæsar delivered a\r\npanegyric over her in which he spoke far less about his aunt than\r\nabout her husband Marius, still the great idol of the popular party,\r\nand in defiance of a still unrepealed statute of Sulla he caused the\r\nbust of Marius to be carried among the family images.\r\n\r\nIn 65 B.C. Cæsar was elected ædile. He was obliged to plunge himself\r\nheavily into debt to obtain this office; and after his election he did\r\nnot hesitate to go still deeper into debt for the purpose of providing\r\nmagnificent shows for the people at the public games. In virtue of the\r\npower of his office Cæsar placed the statue of Marius, surrounded by\r\nthe trophies of his Cimbrian and Jugurthine victories, among the new\r\nornaments of the capitol. At the close of his term as ædile Cæsar\r\nsought to be sent to Egypt for the purpose of forming Egypt into a\r\nRoman province, in accordance with the will of the Egyptian king,\r\nPtolemy Alexander. This important mission, however, was denied to\r\nCæsar, to whom was assigned the duty of presiding in the tribunal\r\nwhich conducted the investigation in cases of suspected murder.\r\n\r\nThe following year, the year of the consulship of Cicero and the\r\nconspiracy of Catiline, Cæsar passed temporarily under a cloud on\r\naccount of his suspected connection with the conspiracy. The suspicion\r\nthat Cæsar had at least been privy to the plans of the conspirators\r\nwas strengthened by his efforts to prevent the death sentence being\r\npassed against their leaders.\r\n\r\nThe Roman historian Sallust, in his history of Catiline, has reported\r\nCæsar's speech in the Senate on this occasion, which serves to\r\nillustrate the craftiness of the man. A portion of this speech is here\r\ninserted:\r\n\r\n     \"In all debates, Conscript Fathers, when the matter under\r\n     deliberation is in its nature doubtful, it is the duty of\r\n     every senator to bring to the question a mind free from\r\n     animosity and friendship, from anger and compassion. When\r\n     those emotions prevail, the understanding is clouded, and\r\n     truth is scarcely perceived. To be passionate and just at\r\n     the same time is not in the power of man. Reason, when\r\n     unbiased, and left to act with freedom, answers all our\r\n     purposes; when passion gains the ascendant, reason is\r\n     fatigued, and judgment lends no assistance.\r\n\r\n     \"In the case now before us, let it be our wisdom, Conscript\r\n     Fathers, not to suffer the crimes of Lentulus and his\r\n     accomplices to hurry you beyond the bounds of moderation.\r\n     Indignation may operate on your minds, but a due sense of\r\n     your own dignity, I trust, will preponderate. My opinion is\r\n     this; if you know of any pains and penalties adequate to the\r\n     guilt of the conspirators, pronounce your judgment; I have\r\n     no objection. If you think death a sufficient punishment, I\r\n     concur with Silanus; but if the guilt of the prisoners\r\n     exceeds all forms of vindictive justice, we should rest\r\n     contented with the laws known to the constitution.\r\n\r\n     \"The senators who have gone before me have exhausted the\r\n     colors of rhetoric, and in a pathetic style have painted\r\n     forth the miseries of their country. They have displayed the\r\n     horrors of war, and the wretched condition of the\r\n     vanquished; the young of both sexes suffering violation;\r\n     children torn from the mother's arms; virtuous matrons\r\n     exposed to the brutal passions of the conqueror; the houses\r\n     of citizens, and the temples of the gods, pillaged without\r\n     distinction; the city made a theater of blood and horror; in\r\n     a word, desolation and massacre in every quarter.\r\n\r\n     \"But why, immortal gods! why all that waste of eloquence?\r\n     Was it to inflame our passions? to kindle indignation? to\r\n     excite a detestation of rebellion? If the guilt of these men\r\n     is not of itself sufficient to fire us with resentment, is\r\n     it in power of words to do it? I answer, No; resentment is\r\n     implanted in our hearts by the hand of nature; every man is\r\n     sensible of injury and oppression; many are apt to feel too\r\n     intensely. But we know, Conscript Fathers, that resentment\r\n     does not operate alike in all the ranks of life: he who\r\n     dwells in obscurity may commit an act of violence, but the\r\n     consequence is confined to a small circle. The fame of the\r\n     offender, like his fortune, makes no noise in the world. It\r\n     is otherwise with those who figure in exalted stations; the\r\n     eyes of mankind are upon them; and the wrong they do is\r\n     considered an abuse of power. Moderation is the virtue of\r\n     superior rank. In that preëminence, no apology is allowed\r\n     for the injustice that proceeds from partiality, from anger,\r\n     aversion, or animosity. The injury committed in the lower\r\n     classes of life is called the impulse of sudden passion; in\r\n     the higher stations, it takes the name of pride and\r\n     cruelty....\r\n\r\n     \"With regard to capital punishment, it is a truth well known\r\n     that to the man who lives in distress and anguish of heart,\r\n     death is not an evil; it is a release from pain and misery;\r\n     it puts an end to the calamities of life; and after the\r\n     dissolution of the body, all is peace; neither care nor joy\r\n     can then intrude....\r\n\r\n     \"It may be said, who will object to a decree against the\r\n     enemies of their country? The answer is obvious; time may\r\n     engender discontent; a future day may condemn the\r\n     proceeding; unforeseen events and even chance, that with\r\n     wild caprice perplexes human affairs, may give us reason to\r\n     repent. The punishment of traitors, however severe, cannot\r\n     be more than their flagitious deeds deserve; but it behooves\r\n     us, Conscript Fathers, to weigh well the consequences before\r\n     we proceed to judgment. Acts of state, that sprung from\r\n     policy, and were perhaps expedient on the spur of the\r\n     occasion, have grown into precedents often found to be of\r\n     evil tendency. The administration may fall into the hands of\r\n     ignorance and incapacity; and in that case, the measure,\r\n     which at first was just and proper, becomes by\r\n     misapplication to other men and other times the rule of bad\r\n     policy and injustice.\r\n\r\n     \"It must be admitted that, in times like the present, when\r\n     Marcus Tullius Cicero conducts the administration, scenes of\r\n     that tragic nature are not to be apprehended. But in a large\r\n     populous city, when the minds of men are ever in agitation,\r\n     a variety of jarring opinions must prevail. At a future day\r\n     and under another consul, who may have an army at his back,\r\n     falsehood may appear in the garb of truth, and gain\r\n     universal credit. In such a juncture, should the consul,\r\n     encouraged by our example, and armed with the power by the\r\n     decree of the Senate, think proper to unsheath the sword,\r\n     who shall stop him in his career? who will be able to\r\n     appease his vengeance?...\r\n\r\n     \"But you will say, What is the scope of this long argument?\r\n     Shall the conspirators be discharged, and suffered to\r\n     strengthen Catiline's army? Far from it; my advice is this;\r\n     let their estate and effects be confiscated; detain their\r\n     persons in separate prisons, and for that purpose choose the\r\n     strongest of the municipal towns; declare, by a positive\r\n     law, that no motion in their favor shall be brought forward\r\n     in the Senate, and that no appeal shall be made to the\r\n     people. Add to your decree, that whoever shall presume to\r\n     espouse the cause of the guilty shall be deemed an enemy to\r\n     the Commonwealth.\"\r\n\r\nThe year following the conspiracy of Catiline Cæsar secured the office\r\nof prætor. By this time Cæsar had secured such a hold upon the popular\r\nmind as to excite both the fear and hatred of the senatorial party.\r\nThis fear and hatred were manifested during Cæsar's year of office as\r\nprætor by the Senate passing a decree depriving Cæsar and one of the\r\ntribunes (Cæcilius Metellus Cepos) of their offices. Fear of popular\r\nviolence, however, soon induced the Senate to repeal this decree.\r\n\r\nIn December, 62 B.C., there occurred at Rome one of the best\r\nremembered of historical scandals; but one whose exact nature we are\r\nunable to determine on account of lack of knowledge of the character\r\nof the mysteries which were violated.\r\n\r\nThe historian Merivale thus describes this scandal:\r\n\r\n     \"P. Clodius, the corrupt accuser of Catiline, a turbulent\r\n     intriguer like so many members of his house, had ingratiated\r\n     himself with the people by his popular manners. This\r\n     beardless youth, already alike notorious for his debts and\r\n     gallantries, had introduced himself into Cæsar's house in\r\n     female attire during the celebration of the rites of the\r\n     Bona Dea, which should have been studiously guarded from\r\n     male intrusion. A servant maid discovered him and uttered a\r\n     cry of alarm; the mysteries were hastily veiled, and the\r\n     intruder expelled; but the assembled matrons rushing hastily\r\n     home revealed each to her husband the scandal and the sin.\r\n     The nobles affected grave alarm; the pontiffs were summoned\r\n     and consulted, and the people duly informed of the insult\r\n     offered to the deity. As chief of the sacred college, Cæsar\r\n     could not refrain from lending himself to the general\r\n     clamour; but his position was delicate. On the one hand, the\r\n     presumed delinquent was an instrument of his own policy,\r\n     while on the other his own honour and that of his wife\r\n     Pompeia were compromised by the offence. He disappointed\r\n     everybody. He divorced his wife, not because she was guilty,\r\n     but because 'the wife of Cæsar,' as he said, 'should be\r\n     above suspicion.' But he refused to countenance the measures\r\n     which the consuls took, by direction of the senate, for the\r\n     conviction of the reputed culprit; and it may be suspected\r\n     that the money with which Clodius bribed his judges was a\r\n     loan negotiated with Crassus by Cæsar himself. Cicero for\r\n     his part had been lukewarm in an affair, the barefaced\r\n     hypocrisy of which he was perhaps too honourable to\r\n     countenance; but, urged by his wife Terentia, a violent\r\n     woman who meddled much in his affairs, and was jealous at\r\n     the moment of a sister of the culprit, he clearly disproved\r\n     his allegation of absence from the city, and thus embroiled\r\n     himself, to no purpose, with an able and unscrupulous enemy.\r\n     The senate believed their cause gained; the proofs indeed\r\n     were decisive, and they had assigned at their own request a\r\n     military guard to the judges to protect them from the\r\n     anticipated violence of a Clodian mob; but to their\r\n     consternation, on opening the urns, the votes for an\r\n     acquittal were found to be thirty-one opposed to\r\n     twenty-five. 'You only demanded a guard,' then exclaimed\r\n     Catulus with bitter irony, 'to secure the money you were to\r\n     receive.' Cicero attributed to Crassus the scandal of this\r\n     perversion of justice; the nobles sneered at the corruption\r\n     of the knights, and the gulf which separated the two orders\r\n     yawned more widely than ever.\"\r\n\r\nIn 60 B.C. Cæsar was given the command of the province of Farther\r\nSpain; and it was here that his great military abilities were for the\r\nfirst time displayed to the world. It had only been by the means of a\r\nlarge loan (about one million dollars) received from Crassus that\r\nCæsar was enabled to pay off his most pressing creditors, and to make\r\npreparations for his journey to Spain; into such a financial state had\r\nCæsar been reduced by his personal extravagances, his political\r\ncampaign expenses, and his lavish expenditures to win the popular\r\nfavor.\r\n\r\nUpon Cæsar's return from Rome the young general found Pompey still\r\nfurther alienated from the senatorial party. A comparison of the\r\ncharacter of these two Roman leaders, now for a while about to become\r\nclose associates and later (mainly through the limitless ambition and\r\nunprincipled conduct of Cæsar) rivals in a bitter contest for\r\nsupremacy, is perhaps proper at this time. The briefest comparison\r\nwhich can be made perhaps consists in saying that Pompey represented\r\nthe best type of an aristocrat--Cæsar the worst type of the\r\nhypocritical popular demagogue. Neither man consistently stood for\r\nthose things which he was supposed to represent at the outset of his\r\ncareer; neither man, it is probable, ever really believed in them. The\r\ntraining and antecedents of Pompey were of the extreme oligarchical\r\ncharacter; his natural leanings were toward humanity and justice.\r\nCæsar, shouting his championship of the people from the housetops, was\r\nin practice regardless of everything but his own selfish ambitions.\r\nThe populace which he flattered, deceived, and betrayed were to him\r\nmerely the tools by which his success was to be won and occupied about\r\nthe same position in his philosophy of life as the dice with which he\r\nwon large sums of money in gambling.\r\n\r\nPompey was imbued with a strong sense of the sanctity of the law;\r\nCæsar never regarded any law which stood between him and his goal.\r\nPompey dismissed his victorious troops before he approached Rome on\r\nhis return from his Eastern campaigns; Cæsar did not hesitate to lead\r\nhis legions across the Rubicon. Neither possessed any great degree of\r\nconstructive political ability. Pompey's life was one devoted to an\r\nattempt to preserve, Cæsar's was devoted to an attempt to destroy.\r\nCæsar's ability was far greater than that of Pompey in every field of\r\nhuman activity.\r\n\r\nCæsar's Spanish campaign had been so short in duration that he was\r\nenabled to return to Rome in time to run for the consulship in 60 B.C.\r\nIn order to begin his canvass without delay, Cæsar asked leave to\r\nenter the city before receiving his triumph. This permission being\r\nrefused, mainly through the influence of Cato and Cicero, Cæsar gave\r\nup his claim to a triumph and, entering Rome immediately, began his\r\npolitical campaign. Being again hard up for money, Cæsar made an\r\nagreement with a very wealthy candidate for consul, named L. Lucceius,\r\nby the terms of which Lucceius was to provide the campaign funds for\r\nboth candidates, while Cæsar was to furnish the reputation and\r\npopularity. This combination resulted better for Cæsar than for\r\nLucceius; Cæsar received his share of the benefit from the campaign\r\nfund, but the benefit of his popularity did not seem to extend to his\r\nrunning mate. The election resulted in the choice of Cæsar and M.\r\nCalpurnius Bibulus, the candidate of the Cato-Cicero faction.\r\n\r\nAt this time Cæsar persuaded Pompey and Crassus to form the first\r\ntriumvirate with him. This triumvirate was nothing more nor less than\r\na Roman political machine, by means of which these three men expected\r\nto be able to make themselves the political bosses of the city. To\r\ncement this political union, Pompey married Julia, the daughter of\r\nCæsar.\r\n\r\nThe most important event of Cæsar's consulship was the passage of an\r\nagrarian act providing for the division of public lands in Campania\r\namong the old soldiers of Pompey. The members of the triumvirate\r\nproved themselves to be strong enough to force this measure through in\r\nspite of the opposition of the consul Bibulus, of Cato, and of others.\r\n\r\nThe measure was not passed, however, without considerable violence and\r\ndisregard of the technical rules of the Roman law.\r\n\r\nThe Senate, acting under the authority of the Sempronian Law, had\r\nassigned the woods and roads as the provinces to which the consuls of\r\nthe year were to be assigned after the expiration of their terms of\r\noffice. Cæsar, however, who throughout his career never bothered\r\nhimself very much as to what the law was, secured the passage by the\r\ncomitia tributa of a law introduced by the tribune Vatinius, which\r\ngave to Cæsar the provinces of Cisalpine Gaul and Illyricum and three\r\nlegions for five years. Later the Senate (to prevent another appeal by\r\nCæsar to the people) added Transalpine Gaul and another legion to his\r\ncommand. The time of his command was also later extended.\r\n\r\nIt was the success of Cæsar's Gallic campaigns (58-51 B.C.) which\r\nrendered possible his overthrow of the republic, and the importance of\r\nthis war is therefore very great, but it is unnecessary to deal with\r\nthe military details of these campaigns.\r\n\r\nDuring the years of Cæsar's absence from Rome the first triumvirate\r\nhad fallen to pieces. In the year 55 B.C. Pompey and Crassus, without\r\nopposition, had been elected to the consulship for a second term. At\r\nthe conclusion of this consulship Crassus was sent with an army\r\nagainst the Parthians, by whom he was defeated and killed in 53 B.C.\r\nIn the meantime Julia, daughter of Cæsar and wife of Pompey, had died\r\nat Rome in 54 B.C. Crassus and Julia had been the two persons who had\r\nkept Cæsar and Pompey together, and from this time these two leaders\r\nrapidly drifted apart.\r\n\r\nAll this time affairs at Rome were constantly falling into worse and\r\nworse stages of corruption and confusion. In 58 B.C. (through the\r\nefforts of Cæsar's friends, led by Clodius) Cicero had been banished\r\nfrom Rome; in 57 B.C. he was recalled, and honors were heaped upon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn 54 B.C. all the candidates for the consulship were prosecuted for\r\nbribery, and the consular elections postponed seven months. Many\r\nwanted Pompey named as dictator at this period. A little later he\r\nactually served for a considerable period as sole consul. It would\r\nprobably have been possible for Pompey, at this time, to have\r\nanticipated Cæsar and to have made himself emperor of Rome, but his\r\nefforts were rather directed toward the restoration of the old order\r\nof things in the republic. The course of events had once more united\r\nPompey with the moderate senatorial party.\r\n\r\nThe election of 52 B.C. was notable, even among the other elections of\r\nthis period, for the enormous extent of the corruption funds used by\r\nthe various candidates. In the course of this campaign the notorious\r\nClodius, who was a candidate for prætor, with a retinue of friends and\r\nclients one day chanced to encounter T. Annius Milo, a candidate for\r\nconsul belonging to the senatorial party, with a like body of\r\nretainers. A conflict resulted in which Clodius was killed. The next\r\nday Clodius's friends, aided by all the lawless elements of the Roman\r\npopulation, made a pyre for the corpse out of the seats of the senate\r\nhouse and burned the dead body of Clodius and the senate house\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe Roman historian Florus thus reviews the situation reached by the\r\nRoman republic at the time of the civil war between Cæsar and Pompey:\r\n\r\n     \"This is the third age of the Roman people, with reference\r\n     to its transactions beyond the sea; an age in which, when\r\n     they had once ventured beyond Italy, they carried their arms\r\n     through the whole world. Of which age, the first hundred\r\n     years were pure and pious, and, as I have called them,\r\n     'golden'; free from vice and immorality, as there yet\r\n     remained the sincere and harmless integrity of the pastoral\r\n     life, and the imminent dread of a Carthaginian enemy\r\n     supported the ancient discipline.\r\n\r\n     \"The succeeding hundred, reckoned from the fall of Carthage,\r\n     Corinth and Numantia, and from the inheritance bequeathed us\r\n     by King Attalus in Asia, to the times of Cæsar and Pompey,\r\n     and those of Augustus who succeeded them, and of whom we\r\n     shall speak hereafter, were as lamentable and disgraceful\r\n     for the domestic calamities, as they were honourable for the\r\n     lustre of the warlike exploits that distinguished them. For,\r\n     as it was glorious and praiseworthy to have acquired the\r\n     rich and powerful provinces of Gaul, Thrace, Cilicia, and\r\n     Cappadocia, as well as those of the Armenians and Britons,\r\n     so it was disgraceful and lamentable at the same time to\r\n     have fought at home with our own citizens, with our allies,\r\n     our slaves, our gladiators.\r\n\r\n     \"I know not whether it would have been better for the Romans\r\n     to have been content with Sicily and Africa, or even to have\r\n     been without them, while still enjoying the dominion of\r\n     Italy, than to grow to such greatness as to be ruined by\r\n     their own strength. For what else produced these intestine\r\n     distractions but excessive good fortune? It was the conquest\r\n     of Syria that first corrupted us, and the succession\r\n     afterwards in Asia, to the estate of the king of Pergamus.\r\n     Such wealth and riches ruined the manners of the age, and\r\n     overwhelmed the republic, which was sunk in vices as in a\r\n     common sewer. For how did it happen that the Roman people\r\n     demanded from the tribunes lands and subsistence, unless\r\n     through the scarcity which they had by their luxury\r\n     produced? Hence there arose the first and second sedition of\r\n     the Gracchi, and a third, that of Apuleius Saturninus. From\r\n     what cause did the equestrian order, being divided from the\r\n     senate, domineer by virtue of the judiciary laws, if it was\r\n     not from avarice, in order that the revenues of the state\r\n     and trials of causes might be made a means of gain? Hence\r\n     again it was that the privilege of citizenship was promised\r\n     to the Latins, and hence were the arms of our allies raised\r\n     against us. And what shall we say as to the wars with the\r\n     slaves? How did they come upon us, but from the excessive\r\n     number of slaves? Whence arose such armies of gladiators\r\n     against their masters, if it was not that a profuse\r\n     liberality, by granting shows to gain the favour of the\r\n     populace, made that an art which was once but a punishment\r\n     of enemies? And to touch upon more specious vices, did not\r\n     the ambition for honours take its rise from the same excess\r\n     of riches? Hence also proceeded the outrages of Marius,\r\n     hence those of Sulla. The extravagant sumptuousness of\r\n     banquets, too, and profuse largesses, were not they the\r\n     effects of wealth, which must in time lead to want? This\r\n     also stirred up Catiline against his country. Finally,\r\n     whence did that insatiable desire of power and rule proceed,\r\n     but from a superabundance of riches? This it was that armed\r\n     Cæsar and Pompey with fatal weapons for the destruction of\r\n     the state.\r\n\r\n     \"Almost the whole world being now subdued, the Roman Empire\r\n     was grown too great to be overthrown by any foreign power.\r\n     Fortune, in consequence, envying the sovereign people of the\r\n     earth, armed it to its own destruction. The outrages of\r\n     Marius and Cinna had already made a sort of prelude within\r\n     the city. The storm of Sulla had thundered even farther, but\r\n     still within the bounds of Italy. The fury of Cæsar and\r\n     Pompey, as with a general deluge or conflagration, overran\r\n     the city, Italy, other countries and nations, and finally\r\n     the whole empire wherever it extended; so that it cannot\r\n     properly be called a civil war, or war with allies; neither\r\n     can it be termed a foreign war; but it was rather a war\r\n     consisting of all these, or even something more than a war.\r\n     If we look at the leaders in it, the whole of the senators\r\n     were on one side or the other; if we consider the armies,\r\n     there were on one side eleven legions, and on the other\r\n     eighteen; the entire flower and strength of the manhood of\r\n     Italy. If we contemplate the auxiliary forces of the allies,\r\n     there were on one side levies of Gauls and Germans, on the\r\n     other Deiotarus, Ariobarzanes, Tarcondimotus, Cotys, and all\r\n     the force of Thrace, Cappadocia, Cilicia, Macedonia, Greece,\r\n     Ætolia, and all the East; if we regard the duration of the\r\n     war, it was four years, a time short in proportion to the\r\n     havoc made in it; if we attend to the space and ground on\r\n     which it was conducted, it arose within Italy, whence it\r\n     spread into Gaul and Spain, and returning from the West,\r\n     settled with its whole force on Epirus and Thessaly; hence\r\n     it suddenly passed into Egypt, then turned towards Asia,\r\n     next fell upon Africa, and at last wheeled back into Spain,\r\n     where it at length found its termination. But the\r\n     animosities of parties did not end with the war, nor\r\n     subsided till the hatred of those who had been defeated\r\n     satiated itself with the murder of the conqueror in the\r\n     midst of the city and the senate.\r\n\r\n     \"The cause of this calamity was the same with that of all\r\n     others, excessive good fortune. For in the consulship of\r\n     Quintus Metellus and Lucius Afranius, when the majesty of\r\n     Rome predominated throughout the world and Rome herself was\r\n     celebrating, in the theatres of Pompey, her recent victories\r\n     and triumphs over Pontus and Armenia, the overgrown power of\r\n     Pompey, as is usual in similar cases, excited among the idle\r\n     citizens a feeling of envy towards him. Metellus,\r\n     discontented at the diminution of his triumph over Crete,\r\n     Cato, ever an enemy to those in power, calumniated Pompey,\r\n     and raised a clamour against his acts. Resentment at such\r\n     conduct drove Pompey to harsh measures, and impelled him to\r\n     provide some support for his authority. Crassus happened at\r\n     that time to be distinguished for family, wealth, and\r\n     honour, but was desirous to have his power still greater.\r\n     Caius Cæsar had become eminent by his eloquence and spirit,\r\n     and by his promotion to the consulate. Yet Pompey rose above\r\n     them both. Cæsar, therefore, being eager to acquire\r\n     distinction, Crassus to increase what he had got, and Pompey\r\n     to add to his, and all being equally covetous of power, they\r\n     readily formed a compact to seize the government. Striving,\r\n     accordingly, with their common forces each for his own\r\n     advancement, Cæsar took the provinces of Gaul, Crassus that\r\n     of Asia, and Pompey that of Spain; they had three vast\r\n     armies and thus the empire of the world was now held by\r\n     these leading personages. Their government extended through\r\n     ten years, at the expiration of this period (for they had\r\n     previously been kept in restraint by dread of one another) a\r\n     rivalry broke forth between Cæsar and Pompey, consequent on\r\n     the death of Crassus among the Parthians, and that of Julia,\r\n     who, being married to Pompey, maintained a good\r\n     understanding between the son-in-law and father-in-law by\r\n     means of this matrimonial bond. But now the power of Cæsar\r\n     was an object of jealousy to Pompey and the eminence of\r\n     Pompey was offensive to Cæsar. The one could not bear an\r\n     equal, nor the other a superior. Sad to relate, they\r\n     struggled for mastery, as if the resources of so great an\r\n     empire would not suffice for two.\"\r\n\r\nThe open rupture between Cæsar on the one side and Pompey and the\r\nSenate on the other came in the year 49 B.C. Cæsar had been promised\r\nthe consulship for the year 48 B.C., but fear of the powerful position\r\nin which Cæsar would be placed if put in possession of the highest\r\ncivil office of the state, while still holding his influence over his\r\nveteran army, together with distrust of Cæsar's motives and ambitions,\r\ncaused great opposition to this plan to develop at Rome.\r\n\r\nCæsar, however, had his active partisans at Rome, among the most\r\nenergetic being the tribunes Gaius Curio, Mark Antony, and Gaius\r\nCassius. The former of these, a man of dissolute character and great\r\nabilities as a politician, proposed to the Senate a resolution calling\r\nupon both Cæsar and Pompey to resign their provinces.\r\n\r\nUpon the passage of this resolution by the Senate, by a vote of three\r\nhundred to seventy, Pompey began to raise troops without the proper\r\nlegal authority, and Cæsar refused to surrender his province, or to\r\nappear before the Senate without the protection of his army. Cæsar,\r\nhowever, sent to the Senate an offer to resign the governorship of\r\nTransalpine Gaul and to reduce the size of his army from ten legions\r\nto two, if the Senate would agree that he should retain the government\r\nof Cisalpine Gaul and the two remaining legions until after the\r\nconsular election of 48 B.C. This offer was rejected by the Senate,\r\nwho then adopted a motion ordering Cæsar to disband his army and\r\nresign his province within a fixed time under penalty of being\r\ndeclared guilty of high treason. This measure was vetoed by the\r\ntribunes, who, however, abandoned their posts and fled to Cæsar's camp\r\nupon Pompey bringing two legions of his soldiers into Rome.\r\n\r\nCæsar, relying upon the support of his veteran army and of the\r\nTransalpian Gauls, to whom, on his own authority and without any color\r\nof legal right, he had granted the full civic rights of Roman\r\ncitizens, now decided on a resort to force.\r\n\r\nThe war was begun by Cæsar crossing the Rubicon. Pompey and his\r\nfriends fled to Greece, where the war was largely fought out. The\r\nreally decisive battle of the war was that of Pharsalus, fought on\r\nAugust 4, 48 B.C. The result of this encounter was the complete\r\noverthrow of Pompey, who fled to Egypt, where he was murdered by those\r\nwho hoped in this manner to earn the gratitude of Cæsar. Pompey's\r\nfollowers in Africa and Spain were soon afterwards put down. The last\r\nbattle of the war, on March 17, 45 B.C., was that of Munda, where the\r\narmy of Pompey's son was defeated and thirty thousand of his soldiers\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nCæsar entered Rome, to receive his last triumph in September, 45 B.C.\r\nThe Roman republic was now overthrown; and the mere puerile expedient\r\nof giving a new name to the monarch, in place of the hated name of\r\nking, did not in any degree alter the truth of the matter. The new\r\ntitle of _imperator_, or emperor, in fact, soon came to be used to\r\ndesignate a ruler of a higher rank, and possessed of a greater degree\r\nof arbitrary power, than that of the monarch who ruled under the name\r\nof _rex_ or king. The forms of government of the republic were still\r\nretained; but the officers who were once the chosen representatives of\r\na free people were now only the ministerial officers through whom a\r\ndespot administered the affairs of his empire. Greatest degradation of\r\nall, the tribunes, once the embodiment of the rights of manhood, now\r\nbecame the especial tools of tyranical control.\r\n\r\nFew people are unaffected by the glamour of success. It is this\r\ncriterion alone which, as Thomas Moore writes, generally marks the\r\ndistinction between the patriot and the traitor.\r\n\r\n    \"Rebellion! foul, dishonoring word,\r\n      Whose wrongful blight so oft has stained\r\n    The holiest cause that tongue or sword\r\n      Of mortal ever lost or gained.\r\n    How many a spirit, born to bless,\r\n      Hath sunk beneath that withering name,\r\n    Whom but a day's, an hour's success\r\n      Had wafted to eternal fame!\r\n    As exhalations, when they burst\r\n    From the warm earth, if chilled at first,\r\n    If checked in soaring from the plain,\r\n    Darken to fogs and sink again;--\r\n    But if they once triumphant spread\r\n    Their wings above the mountain-head,\r\n    Become enthroned in upper air,\r\n    And turn to sun-bright glories there!\"\r\n\r\nThis success, so necessary to earn for the patriot or reformer the\r\nfame to which he is so justly entitled, is too often able to win\r\nadmiration and respect also for the successful enemies of mankind.\r\n\r\nFew members of the human race ever deserved less praise from posterity\r\n(unless indeed, as a tribute to great but misdirected abilities) than\r\nJulius Cæsar; but, nevertheless, many tributes have been laid before\r\nthe tomb of this destroyer of his country's liberties. For example,\r\nthe historian Mommsen, thus eulogizes Cæsar:\r\n\r\n     \"Cæsar, from the outset and as it were by hereditary right\r\n     the head of the popular party, had for thirty years borne\r\n     aloft its banner without ever changing or even so much as\r\n     concealing his colors; he remained democrat even when\r\n     monarch. As he accepted without limitation, apart of course\r\n     from the preposterous projects of Catiline and Clodius, the\r\n     heritage of his party; as he displayed the bitterest, even\r\n     personal, hatred to the aristocracy and the genuine\r\n     aristocrats; and as he retained unchanged the essential\r\n     ideas of Roman democracy, viz., alleviation of the burdens\r\n     of debtors, transmarine colonization, gradual equalization\r\n     of the differences of rights among the classes belonging to\r\n     the State, emancipation of the executive power from the\r\n     Senate; his monarchy was so little at variance with\r\n     democracy, that democracy on the contrary only attained its\r\n     completion and fulfillment by means of that monarchy. For\r\n     his monarchy was not the Oriental despotism of divine right,\r\n     but a monarchy such as Gaius Gracchus wished to found, such\r\n     as Pericles and Cromwell founded--the representation of the\r\n     nation by the man in whom it puts supreme and unlimited\r\n     confidence. The ideas which lay at the foundation of Cæsar's\r\n     work were so far not strictly new; but to him belongs their\r\n     realization, which after all is everywhere the main matter;\r\n     and to him pertains the grandeur of execution, which would\r\n     probably have surprised the brilliant projector himself if\r\n     he could have seen it, and which has impressed, and will\r\n     always impress, every one to whom it has been presented in\r\n     the living reality or in the mirror of history--to whatever\r\n     historical epoch or whatever shade of politics he may\r\n     belong--according to the measure of his ability to\r\n     comprehend human and historical greatness, with deep and\r\n     ever-deepening admiration.\"\r\n\r\nThe laudations of Cæsar, it is perhaps needless to say, are always\r\nfrom men like Mommsen who are absolutely devoid of any true sympathy\r\nfor free government or popular rights. No more striking commentary on\r\nsuch men can be found than from comparing Mommsen's attack upon the\r\nrevolutionary methods of Tiberius Gracchus with his defense of Cæsar,\r\ngiven above.\r\n\r\nThe truth of the matter is that Cæsar was never at any time in his\r\ncareer a sincere member of the popular party. The people were his\r\ndupes, by whose aid he raised himself to the imperial power and\r\ndestroyed the political liberties of his native state. His almost\r\nblasphemous use of the names of the great dead leaders and martyrs of\r\nthe popular cause as cloaks to cover his own selfish and unpatriotic\r\nschemes is not the least of the indictments against him in the eyes of\r\nthe true advocate of popular rights. In such actions, however, Cæsar\r\ndoes not stand alone. In our politics of to-day nothing is more common\r\nfor a politician than to try to cover his corruption by throwing over\r\nhimself the mantle of some great national hero. The cloak of Jefferson\r\nin one political party, and of Lincoln in the other, are striven for\r\nby men who desire to use them solely for the purpose of covering their\r\nopposition to everything for which these men stood.\r\n\r\nNor has Cæsar been without imitators in every age, and in every\r\nrepublic, who, if the opportunity would only permit, desire above all\r\nelse to imitate his life and success. The ability of Cæsar, however,\r\nis seldom or never to be found in his imitators; but the ambition\r\nitself is to be found somewhere among the politicians of every\r\nrepublic. There is also generally a strong influential class that\r\nwould prefer the strong settled rule of one man to the constant\r\npolitical controversies with \"their unsettled effect upon business.\"\r\nAnd the reality of a republic can always be destroyed without\r\naffecting its form, as was done in Rome by the centering of the powers\r\nof the different officials in Cæsar, or more recently, in Mexico, by\r\nthe many successive elections of Diaz to the presidency.\r\n\r\nThe early and violent death of Cæsar came before his plans were\r\ncompleted, and before he had assumed the title, as well as the\r\nauthority, of a king or emperor. The ancient historian Appianus\r\nAlexandrinus has left a vivid account of the closing scene of Cæsar's\r\nlife, some extracts from which are here inserted:\r\n\r\n     \"A rumor was spread that there was an oracle of the Sibyls\r\n     which declared that the Parthians could not be subdued by\r\n     the Romans, unless they were commanded by a king. This made\r\n     some talk publicly that in regard of other nations taxed\r\n     under the Roman empire, there needed no scruple be made at\r\n     the giving Cæsar that title. He, having still refused it,\r\n     hastened all he could to get out of the city where many\r\n     envied him. But four days before the day appointed for his\r\n     departure he was slain by his enemies in the palace, either\r\n     out of malice to see him raised to such supreme felicity and\r\n     height of command, or else (as themselves said) out of a\r\n     desire to restore the commonwealth to its first estate; for\r\n     they feared that, after having overcome these other nations,\r\n     nothing could hinder him from making himself king; yet as it\r\n     appears to me it was only for the name's sake they\r\n     attempted all things; for in the thing itself there is no\r\n     difference between dictator and king.\r\n\r\n     \"There were two chiefs of this conspiracy, the son of that\r\n     Brutus whom Sulla put to death, M. Brutus Cæpio, who came\r\n     for refuge to Cæsar himself after the battle of Pharsalus,\r\n     and C. Cassius, who yielded to him the galleys in the\r\n     Hellespont, both of Pompey's party, and with them was joined\r\n     one of Cæsar's most intimate friends, Decimus Brutus\r\n     Albinus.\r\n\r\n     \"Having all decreed the palace the place of execution, there\r\n     were divers opinions concerning the manner of doing it; some\r\n     being of opinion that they should likewise make away with\r\n     Antony, Cæsar's colleague, the most powerful of his friends,\r\n     and well beloved of the soldiery. But Brutus opposed that,\r\n     saying that it was only by killing Cæsar, who was as a king,\r\n     that they ought to seek for the glory of destroying tyrants;\r\n     and that if they killed his friends too, men would impute\r\n     the action to private enmity, and the faction of Pompey.\r\n     This advice prevailing, they only expected the assembling of\r\n     the Senate. Now the day before, Cæsar being invited to sup\r\n     with Lepidus, carried along with him Decimus Brutus Albinus;\r\n     and during supper the question being proposed what death was\r\n     best for man, some desiring one kind, and some another, he\r\n     alone preferred the suddenest and most unexpected. Thus\r\n     divining for himself, they fell to discourse of the morrow's\r\n     affairs.\r\n\r\n     \"At the same time that Cæsar went to the palace in his\r\n     litter, one of his domestics, who had understood something\r\n     of the conspiracy, came to find Calpurnia; but without\r\n     saying anything to her but that he must speak with Cæsar\r\n     about affairs of importance, he stayed, expecting his return\r\n     from the Senate, because he did not know all the\r\n     particulars; his host of Cnidus, called Artemidorus, running\r\n     to the palace to give him notice of it, came just at the\r\n     moment of his being killed; another, as he sacrificed before\r\n     the gate of the senate house, gave him a note of all the\r\n     conspiracy; but he going in without reading it, it was after\r\n     death found in his hands. As he came out of his litter,\r\n     Lænas, the same who before had spoken to Cassius, came to\r\n     him, and entertained him a long time in private; which\r\n     struck a damp into the chiefs of the conspiracy, the more\r\n     because their conference was long; they already began to\r\n     make signs to one another that they must now kill him before\r\n     he arrested them; but in the sequel of the discourse,\r\n     observing Lænas to use rather the gesture of suppliant than\r\n     accuser, they deferred it; till in the end, seeing him\r\n     return thanks to Cæsar, they took courage.\r\n\r\n     \"They left Trebonius at the gate to stop Antony under the\r\n     pretense of discoursing some business with him; and as soon\r\n     as Cæsar was seated, the other conspirators surrounded him\r\n     according to custom, as friends, having each his dagger\r\n     concealed. At the same time Attilius Cimber standing before\r\n     him began to entreat him to grant the return of his brother\r\n     who was an exile; and upon his refusal, under pretence of\r\n     begging it with more humility, he took him by the robe, and,\r\n     drawing it to him, hung about his neck, crying out, 'Why do\r\n     you delay, my friends?' Thereupon Casca first of all\r\n     reaching over his head, thought to strike his dagger into\r\n     his throat, but wounded him only in the breast. Cæsar,\r\n     having disengaged himself from Cimber, caught hold of\r\n     Casca's hand, leaped from his seat, and threw himself upon\r\n     Casca with a wonderful force; but being at handy grips with\r\n     him, another struck his dagger into his side, Cassius gave\r\n     him a wound in the face, Brutus struck him quite through the\r\n     thigh, Bucolianus wounded him behind the head, and he, like\r\n     one enraged, and roaring like a savage beast, turned\r\n     sometimes to one and sometimes to another; till strength\r\n     failing him after the wound received from Brutus, he threw\r\n     the skirt of his robe over his face and suffered himself\r\n     gently to fall before Pompey's statue. They forebore not to\r\n     give him many stabs after he was down; so that there were\r\n     three and twenty wounds found in his body. And those that\r\n     slew him were so eager that some of them, through vehemence,\r\n     without thinking of it, wounded each other.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nPOST-MORTEM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe daggers of Brutus, Cassius, and their allies, on the Ides of\r\nMarch, 44 B.C., avenged the republic which they were too late to save.\r\nIt thus chanced that the details of the new imperial government were\r\nin the main arranged not by Julius Cæsar but by his great-nephew,\r\nGaius Octavius Cæsar, who succeeded both to the private fortune and\r\nthe public office of the usurper. It was, however, only after another\r\nperiod of civil warfare that the new Cæsar came into his possessions.\r\n\r\nThe story of this civil war belongs to the history of the Roman empire\r\nrather than to that of the Roman republic, and will be referred to\r\nonly briefly. Octavius Cæsar was in Illyricum at the time of the\r\nassassination of his uncle. Hastening to Rome, he found the city\r\ndivided into two factions, one led by Brutus and Cassius, composed of\r\nthose who desired to restore the republic; and the other, the old\r\nadherents of Cæsar, under the leadership of Mark Antony.\r\n\r\nOctavius had perhaps more to fear from the friends of his uncle than\r\nfrom his assassinators, as the latter, while they would have prevented\r\nhim from assuming the political powers of his uncle, would probably\r\nnot have opposed his taking possession of the latter's private\r\nfortune; while Mark Antony, who had possession of Cæsar's papers and\r\nmoney, was probably intending to seize both the powers and property of\r\nJulius Cæsar. Octavius Cæsar, however, was possessed of a fair share\r\nboth of his uncle's ability and perfidy, and proved himself more than\r\na match for all his enemies, both in open warfare and in secret\r\ntreachery.\r\n\r\nAt first Octavius seemed inclined to enter into an alliance with\r\nCicero and some of the other senators against Antony, but finding that\r\nCicero sought to restore the republic and could not be used as his\r\ntool, Octavius reached an agreement with Antony, and the two, together\r\nwith Lepidus, formed the second triumvirate.\r\n\r\nThe immediate result of this coalition was another proscription,\r\nrecalling the days of Sulla; the condemnation of all the assassinators\r\nof Cæsar by the Senate; and extensive military preparations to\r\noverthrow the armies which they had collected.\r\n\r\nThe ancient historian Appian of Alexandria thus describes the terrors\r\nof the proscriptions:\r\n\r\n     \"The proscription being published, guards were forthwith\r\n     placed at the gates and all the avenues of the city, at the\r\n     seaports, and in the marshes, and in all places where there\r\n     was any likelihood an unhappy man might shelter himself;\r\n     besides, centurions were commanded abroad, to make search in\r\n     the country, which was done all at an instant; so that both\r\n     within and without the city many persons died suddenly\r\n     several kinds of deaths. The streets were filled with the\r\n     sad spectacle of heads carrying to the triumvirs, to receive\r\n     the reward; and every step some person of quality,\r\n     endeavoring to save himself, was met shamefully disguised;\r\n     some running down into wells, and others into privies; some\r\n     hiding themselves in the tops of the chimneys, or under the\r\n     tiles, where they durst not utter a sigh or a groan; for\r\n     they stood in more fear of their wives, or children, or\r\n     freedmen, or slaves, or debtors, or neighbours that coveted\r\n     some of their goods, than of the murderers themselves.\r\n\r\n     \"All private grudges were now discovered; and it was a\r\n     strange change to see the prime men of the senate,\r\n     consulars, prætors, tribunes, or pretenders to these\r\n     dignities cast themselves at the feet of their slaves with\r\n     tears in their eyes, begging and caressing them, calling\r\n     them their saviours and patrons; and, which is most\r\n     deplorable, not to be able with all these submissions to\r\n     obtain the least favour. The most pernicious seditions and\r\n     cruellest of wars never had anything in them so terrible as\r\n     the calamities wherewith the city was now affrighted; for in\r\n     war and tumult none but enemies were feared, and domestics\r\n     were confided in; whereas now domestics were more dreaded\r\n     than enemies, because having no cause to fear for\r\n     themselves, as in war or tumult, from familiars they became\r\n     of a sudden persecutors; either out of a dissembled hate, or\r\n     out of the hope of recompense publicly proposed, or because\r\n     of some silver or gold hid in the house; so that no person\r\n     found himself secure in his house, servants being ordinarily\r\n     more sensible of profit than of the affection they owe to\r\n     their masters; and though some might be found faithful and\r\n     kind, yet they durst not assist a proscript, nor conceal\r\n     him, nor so much as stay with him, for fear of falling into\r\n     the same misfortune.\r\n\r\n     \"There was now much more danger than when the seventeen\r\n     first proscribed were fallen upon; for then no person being\r\n     publicly proscribed when on a sudden they saw some killed,\r\n     one man defended another, for fear lest the same should\r\n     happen to him. But after the proscription was published\r\n     those comprised in it were presently forsaken by all the\r\n     world; some that thought themselves secure, having their\r\n     minds bent on profit, sought them to deliver them to the\r\n     murderers, that they might have the reward; others pillaged\r\n     the houses of those that had been killed, and with the\r\n     present gain comforted themselves against the public\r\n     misery.\r\n\r\n     \"The most prudent and moderate, surprised at a thing so\r\n     extraordinary, stood like men astonished, considering that\r\n     other cities turmoiled with divisions were re-established by\r\n     the concord of their citizens; whereas the Romans, already\r\n     afflicted with civil dissensions, completed their ruin by\r\n     this reconciliation. Some were killed defending themselves;\r\n     others, who thought themselves not condemned, without any\r\n     defence; some let themselves die with hunger, or hanged, or\r\n     drowned themselves, or threw themselves headlong from the\r\n     tops of houses, or cast themselves into the fire, or ran to\r\n     meet their murderers; others again sought to protract the\r\n     time; and either hid themselves, or begged shamefully, or\r\n     fled, or offered money to save their lives. Many likewise\r\n     were slain contrary to the intention of the triumvirs,\r\n     either by mistake, or out of some particular grudge; but the\r\n     bodies of the proscripts might be known from the others,\r\n     because they wanted the head, which was cut off, and carried\r\n     before the tribunal for orations, where they paid the\r\n     reward. On the other side, wonderful examples were to be\r\n     seen of the affection of wives, children, brethren and\r\n     slaves; who found out a thousand inventions to save their\r\n     husbands, fathers, brethren, or masters; died with them when\r\n     they were discovered, or killed themselves upon those bodies\r\n     they were not able to defend.\r\n\r\n     \"Of those that escaped the proscription, some pursued by\r\n     their ill fortune, perished by shipwreck; others saved\r\n     beyond all probability, came afterwards to exercise\r\n     dignities in the city, to have command of armies and arrive\r\n     at the honour of triumph. Such wonderful things were to be\r\n     seen in those days which do not happen in an ordinary city,\r\n     or in a small kingdom but in the mistress of the world, as\r\n     well by sea as land; Providence disposing it so to reduce\r\n     things to that excellent order wherein you now see them. Not\r\n     but that Rome felt the same miseries under Sulla, and before\r\n     him under Marius; and we have in writing of them reported\r\n     many actions of cruelty, even to the depriving their enemies\r\n     of burial; but what passed under the triumvirs made much\r\n     more noise, because of the height of their reputations; and\r\n     particularly the valour and good fortune of him, who having\r\n     fixed the foundations of this empire, has left it to those\r\n     of his race and name, even to this present.\"\r\n\r\nAmong those murdered at this time was the greatest of all Roman\r\norators, Marcus Tullius Cicero.\r\n\r\nAn interesting incident connected with the raising of the money for\r\nthe campaign against Brutus and Cassius was the refusal of the Roman\r\nwomen at this time to pay their share of the taxes demanded of the\r\nRoman citizens for the support of the armies to be raised against\r\nBrutus and Cassius.\r\n\r\nHortensia, the daughter of a great orator, was their spokesman. The\r\nburden of her plea was that this was a family quarrel, a civil war,\r\nnot one for the defense of Rome. \"Let war with the Gauls or the\r\nParthians come,\" she said, \"and we shall not be inferior to our\r\nmothers in zeal for the common safety, but for civil wars may we never\r\ncontribute nor even assist you against one another. Why should we pay\r\ntaxes, when we have no part in the honors, the commands, the\r\nstatecraft for which you contend against one another with such harmful\r\nresults?\"\r\n\r\nThe campaign resulted in the complete destruction of all the armies\r\nopposed to the triumvirate, the most decisive battle of the campaign\r\nbeing that at Philippi. How Antony and Octavius again quarreled after\r\ntheir common enemy had been overthrown, how the destruction of Antony\r\nresulted from his infatuation for Cleopatra, and how Octavius at\r\nlength secured the undisputed rule of the Roman world need not here be\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nThe date of the beginning of the reign of Octavius Cæsar as Emperor of\r\nRome is generally taken as 31 B.C. Like his predecessor, Octavius\r\nCæsar endeavored to preserve as far as possible the empty forms of\r\nrepublican rule.\r\n\r\nIn the overthrow of the early Roman kingdom the power of the kings had\r\nmainly passed to the consuls, but partially to other officials, and\r\nsome of the powers possessed by the early consuls had been gradually\r\ntaken away from them and given to other newly created officials, such\r\nas the censors and prætors. For centuries there had been a continued\r\npolicy of division of powers; this policy was now suddenly reversed,\r\nand governmental powers of all kinds reunited in a single official.\r\nThis was accomplished by conferring upon Octavius Cæsar, for life,\r\neach of the various offices known in the government of the Roman\r\nrepublic. Octavius Cæsar became life censor, life consul, and life\r\ntribune. The appointment of his colleagues in all these offices was\r\nlikewise in his power. The cycle of governmental change had now been\r\ncompleted, and the Roman emperor possessed all the old powers of the\r\nRoman kings. In the field of legislation it is indeed probable that\r\nthe power of the emperor was greater than that of his early\r\npredecessors.\r\n\r\n     \"The old popular assemblies for a period after the\r\n     establishment of the Empire still went through the form of\r\n     passing acts, which had been prepared by the real governing\r\n     power, but in addition to this the Emperor was given the\r\n     power of direct legislation by his own authority.\r\n\r\n     \"Laws which owed their force to the authority of the Emperor\r\n     were known as Constitutiones and may be divided into four\r\n     principal classes, as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"1. Edicts, which were public ordinances, of universal\r\n     application throughout the Empire. These had the authority\r\n     of laws, inasmuch as they were generally enforced and\r\n     applied to all. In the earlier reigns they were frequently\r\n     renewed, and they derived their authority from the Emperor\r\n     as the prætorian edict did from the prætor. Gradually they\r\n     came to be held as permanently binding the real ground of\r\n     their permanent force, custom was overlooked, and the\r\n     imperial authority was regarded as such ground.\r\n\r\n     \"2. Decrees, which were decisions in judicial cases brought\r\n     before the Emperor as final court of appeal. Inasmuch as\r\n     they were interpretations of law, they were regarded as\r\n     binding upon all courts.\r\n\r\n     \"3. Rescripts, which were decisions upon questions of law\r\n     submitted by courts and private persons. They were closely\r\n     connected with the pontifical interpretations.\r\n\r\n     \"4. Mandates, which were directions to officials in the\r\n     exercise of their offices. These, by repetition in the\r\n     various instructions sent out from time to time by the\r\n     Emperor, became a source of general law. They were\r\n     theoretically in force only during the lifetime of the\r\n     Emperor from which they proceeded; but they became of\r\n     permanent force because of repetition and custom.\" (Lee's\r\n     _Historical Jurisprudence_.)\r\n\r\nThere are writers who look with favor upon this establishment of the\r\nRoman empire, just as there are those of the same caliber who, if\r\nsome form of a dictatorship should be substituted for our present\r\nrepublican form of government, would be loudest in their approval of\r\nthe change. Dr. Hirschfeld, of the University of Berlin, gives us the\r\nfollowing roseate picture of the benefits which Rome received from the\r\nchange:\r\n\r\n     \"The reorganization of the government by Augustus, open to\r\n     criticism as it is in many respects, was a blessing to the\r\n     Roman empire. The view which prevailed under the republic,\r\n     that the provinces had been conquered only to be sucked dry\r\n     by senators and knights, governors, and tax-farmers in\r\n     league or in rivalry of greed (we have one example out of\r\n     hundreds in Verres, condemned to immortality by the\r\n     eloquence of Cicero), this view was laid aside with the\r\n     advent of the empire, and even if extortion did not wholly\r\n     cease in the senatorial provinces, yet the provincial\r\n     administration of the first two centuries A.D. is infinitely\r\n     superior to the systematic spoliation of the republic. The\r\n     governors are no longer masters armed with absolute\r\n     authority, constrained to extort money as fast as possible\r\n     from the provincials committed to their charge in order to\r\n     meet debts contracted by their own extravagance and, more\r\n     especially, by that bribery of the populace which was\r\n     indispensable to their advancement. They are officials under\r\n     strict control, drawing from the government salaries fully\r\n     sufficient to their needs. It was a measure imperatively\r\n     called for by the altered circumstances of the time and\r\n     fraught with most important consequences to create, as\r\n     Augustus did, a class of salaried imperial officials and\r\n     definitely break with the high-minded but wrong-minded\r\n     principle of the republic by which the higher posts were\r\n     bestowed as honorary appointments, and none but subordinate\r\n     officials were paid, thus branding the latter with the\r\n     stigma of servitude.\r\n\r\n     \"It is true that the cautious reformer adopted into his new\r\n     system of government the old names and the offices which had\r\n     come down from republican times, with the exception of the\r\n     censorship and the dictatorship, which last had long been\r\n     obsolete. But these were intended from the outset to lead\r\n     but a phantom existence and to take no part in the great\r\n     task of imperial administration. Augustus drew his own body\r\n     of officials from the knightly class, and under the\r\n     unpretentious titles of procurator and præfect practically\r\n     committed the whole administration of the empire to their\r\n     hands, reserving, apart from certain distinguished sinecures\r\n     in Rome, and Italy, for the senators the præfecture of the\r\n     city, all the great governorships except Egypt, and the\r\n     highest commands in the army. The handsome salaries--varying\r\n     in the later days of the empire from £600 to £3,600 ($3,000\r\n     to $18,000)--and the great influence attached to the\r\n     procuratorial career, which opened the way to the lofty\r\n     positions of præfect of Egypt and commander of the prætorian\r\n     guards at Rome, rendered the service very desirable and\r\n     highly esteemed.\r\n\r\n     \"While the high-born magistrates of the republic entered\r\n     upon their one year's tenure of office without any training\r\n     whatsoever, and were, of course, obliged to rely upon the\r\n     knowledge and trustworthiness of the permanent staff of\r\n     clerks, recorders and cashiers in their department, there\r\n     grew up under the empire a professional class of government\r\n     officials who, schooled by years of experience and\r\n     continuance in office and supported by a numerous staff\r\n     recruited from the imperial freedmen and slaves, were in a\r\n     position to cope with the requirements of a world-wide\r\n     empire. These procurators, some as governors-in-chief of the\r\n     smaller imperial provinces, some as assistants to the\r\n     governors of the greater, watched over the interests of the\r\n     public exchequer and the emperor's private property, or\r\n     looked after the imperial buildings and aqueducts, the\r\n     imperial games, the mint, the corn supply of Rome, and the\r\n     alimentary institutions, the legacies left to the emperors,\r\n     their castles and demesnes in Italy and abroad,--in short,\r\n     everything that fell within the vast and ever widening\r\n     sphere of imperial government. Meanwhile the exchequer of\r\n     the senate dwindled and dwindled, till it finally came to be\r\n     merely the exchequer of the city of Rome.\"\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely any event which takes place upon this earth which\r\nproduces unmixed evil or unmixed good. There is some slight element of\r\ntruth in some of the statements of the last quotation. There was some\r\ntemporary restraint placed upon the dishonesty and cruelty of the\r\nRoman tax collectors; and there was undoubtedly a permanent\r\nimprovement in the ability of the men holding the minor positions\r\nunder the Roman government, through the introduction of what may be\r\ncalled a civil-service system. But the contention that the\r\nestablishment of the empire was for the benefit either of the Roman\r\ncitizens or of the Roman subjects is too ridiculous to merit even a\r\ndenial. To show the ridiculousness of such a statement it is only\r\nnecessary to point to the history of the Roman empire during the half\r\ncentury following the death of Octavius Cæsar. Corrupt as the\r\nadministration of the government often was under the republic, and\r\ncruel as were the successful factional leaders on a few occasions,\r\nsuch conditions as existed in Rome under the emperors Tiberius,\r\nCaligula, and Nero could never have existed under the republic.\r\n\r\nThe character of the Roman empire was a most anomalous one. In the\r\nhistory of the empire we find the unparalleled situation of an\r\nabsolute despotism without any hereditary nobility and even without\r\nany well-established principle as to the descent of the royal power to\r\nthe children of the deceased emperor. Under the most despotic days of\r\nthe empire any Roman citizen might rise to any position of power or\r\ndignity under the emperor; nay, more than this, any subject of the\r\nRoman empire, no matter how low his origin or condition in society,\r\nmight be thrust, by a lucky turn of the wheel of fortune, into the\r\nimperial purple itself.\r\n\r\nThe Roman emperors came from every strata of society, and from every\r\nportion of the Roman empire. At different times we see the son of a\r\nslave, a Syrian sun priest, a Dacian peasant, seated in the chair of\r\nthe Cæsars; but this state of affairs in no way alleviated or excused\r\nthe evils which the empire brought upon its subjects. The exploitation\r\nof the millions at the hands of a favored few is not rendered more\r\ndefensible by the fact that any individual has the chance, by\r\nextraordinary ability, extraordinary dishonesty, or extraordinary good\r\nfortune, to raise himself out of the ranks of the exploited into those\r\nof the exploiters.\r\n\r\nThe history of Rome, therefore, cannot be so perverted as to teach the\r\nlesson which some seem to draw from it, that the substitution of a\r\ndespotism for popular rule may, under some circumstances, be a\r\nbenefit to the community. It is never by the destruction of liberty\r\nthat the evils of popular rule can be eliminated. In the past, in the\r\npresent, and in the future, the only remedy for the evils of liberty\r\nis more liberty; and the lesson which should be learned from the fall\r\nof the Roman republic is that any country, where the privileged\r\nclasses are suffered to retain their unjust privileges at the expense\r\nof the community, must in the end suffer some such terrible penalty as\r\nthat paid by Rome under the tyranny and misrule of the Roman empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE COMPARISON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe comparisons between the history and problems of the Roman republic\r\nand those of our own country have been sometimes directly referred to,\r\nsometimes merely indicated, in the course of this book. While it is\r\nhoped that the reader has been able to follow the train of ideas\r\nsuggested by the author, and to apply the lessons taught by the story\r\nof the fall of the Roman republic to aid in the solution of the\r\nAmerican problems of to-day, it is thought advisable, in this final\r\nchapter of the book, to combine and summarize the difficult problems\r\nof economics, civics, and politics anticipated in Roman experience.\r\n\r\nFirst of all comes the lesson, so often taught by Roman history, so\r\noften already referred to in this book, that political equality is\r\nnever by itself sufficient to secure either the protection of the\r\nweaker members of society or the general welfare of the community.\r\nPolitical equality means nothing unless supplemented by laws which\r\nsecure economic justice.\r\n\r\nThe oft-repeated cry that politics and business should be kept\r\nseparate is the product of a shallow, unreasoning, or hypocritical\r\nmind--generally the latter. This cry is the argument of the\r\nstand-patter, of the man who trembles for the existence of the United\r\nStates Constitution and of American institutions when any proposal is\r\nmade to pass a law in the interests of the mass of the community, but\r\nwho can view with complacency the enactment of statutes for the\r\nbenefit of certain favored classes. Economic problems and special\r\nprivileges were among the greatest problems and dangers in the Roman\r\nrepublic, as they are in America to-day.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to the exact form of the economic questions, differences,\r\nof course, begin to appear. Tariffs, trusts, regulation of commerce,\r\nwere never great political questions in the days of the Roman\r\nrepublic. The greatest source of scandal and class favoritism at Rome\r\nwas to be found in the management and distribution of the public\r\nlands. This particular problem was one which our country, for nearly a\r\ncentury of national existence, was able to handle, in the main, wisely\r\nand honestly. The great body of that vast expanse of rich farming\r\nland, which was once the greatest asset of the United States, was\r\ndisposed of to actual settlers, who have played an important part in\r\nthe development of our wonderful West. Recently, however, corruption\r\neven along this line has begun to manifest itself in America. Passing\r\nover the numerous charges of actual corruption which have been made,\r\nit is to be regretted that the United States government has of late\r\nshown a decided disposition to favor great interests rather than\r\nordinary individuals in the management of the public resources. An\r\nextremely indefensible discrimination is to be found in the act of\r\nJuly 1, 1902, which established the form of civil government for the\r\nPhilippine Islands. Section 15 of this act, in providing for the\r\nmanagement of the public lands, provided that no more than sixteen\r\nhectares of such land can be disposed of to any one individual, while\r\na corporation may acquire as much as 1,024 hectares.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of pure governmental science the most interesting\r\ncomparison between Rome and the United States lies in the elaborate\r\nand complicated system of checks and balances to be found in each\r\ngovernment. The framers of each system seem generally to have been\r\nthinking more of securing perfect brakes than of installing sufficient\r\noperating power. It is a mere hackneyed remark to say that the most\r\nprominent characteristic of the work of the Federal Constitutional\r\nConvention was the system of checks and balances it developed, while\r\nthis same principle was carried to such an extreme in the organization\r\nof the Roman government that it almost seems strange to an outside\r\nobserver that at times the resisting power of the \"brakes\" did not\r\nprove more powerful than the operating power of the government, with\r\nthe result of a total failure of all government, and chaos, or\r\nanarchy.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting of the \"checks\" in the Roman government was the\r\nveto power of the tribunes--interesting alike for its contemporary\r\nimportance at Rome, and perhaps even more so for the great and\r\nstrangely directed influence which it has had upon the later\r\ndevelopment of governmental institutions throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThe veto power of the Roman tribune was an innovation in government.\r\nIt was, however, a political idea which was destined to take deep\r\nroot, and to be copied by countries whose very beginnings were, as\r\nyet, far in the future. There is to-day no constitutional government\r\nin whose organization the veto power is not found in some form; in the\r\ngreat majority of modern governments the veto power occupies a most\r\nprominent place.\r\n\r\nThe modern veto power has departed far from that of the Roman tribune,\r\nboth in practice and theory. The veto power of the latter was merely a\r\ncheck upon power; the modern veto power is both a check upon power and\r\na positive power in the hands of the official to whom it is given.\r\n\r\nThe Roman veto was given to an officer who had no power except of a\r\nnegative character; it could be interposed against executive acts and\r\njudicial proceedings as well as against legislative enactments.\r\n\r\nThe modern veto power is directed solely against legislative acts and\r\nis put in the hands of the executive department of the government.\r\nAgainst the legislative department it is a check, but to the executive\r\ndepartment it is a grant of positive power. In the United States the\r\nveto is more a club in the hands of the executive department than a\r\ncheck upon the legislative. The veto power also tends to break down\r\nthe dividing line between the executive and the legislative\r\ndepartments. In the United States the President and the governors of\r\nthe different states in reality constitute a third branch of the\r\nrespective legislative departments.\r\n\r\nThe story of the Gracchi is replete with suggestions of comparisons\r\nwith modern conditions. The failure of these reformers was primarily\r\ndue to the lack of steadfast perseverance on the part of the mass of\r\ntheir followers. It is this same phenomenon which does more than any\r\nother to bring about the failure of needed and widely supported\r\nreforms at the present time in our country. It is always much easier\r\nto win the support of a majority of voters to a reform measure than it\r\nis to retain such majority during the tedious delays which the\r\nopponents of reform are so adept in producing. Delay is always the\r\ngreat weapon of the supporters of any special interest which is\r\nattacked. The beneficiaries from unfair discriminations or special\r\ninterests, and their allies, never desert the fight from weariness, no\r\nmatter how long it may be continued; but once the first spell of\r\nenthusiasm has passed away, the supporters of the reform gradually\r\ndrop by the wayside. How many times have we seen the people vote time\r\nafter time in support of a certain reform only to weaken at the\r\ncrisis, and allow the ultimate victory to rest with the supporters of\r\nspecial interests! For illustration we need only cite the long contest\r\nin the metropolis of the West for a fair deal to the people from the\r\nstreet-car companies, where after nine years of contest the majority\r\nof the voters, at the critical contest, deserted the mayor, who had\r\nresolutely stood for the principles for which the voters had declared\r\nyear after year, and gave to the companies a contract giving them all\r\nthat they had even dared to hope for.\r\n\r\nThe deposition of the tribune Marcus Octavius is without question the\r\nfirst historical application of the principle of the recall of public\r\nofficials. This precedent was never again followed at Rome, and the\r\nrecall of public officers never became a part of the Roman political\r\nsystem. Such an expedient, in fact, could never have been necessary at\r\nRome, except in very extreme cases, on account of the very short terms\r\nof office for which all Roman officials were elected. The only states\r\nof this country which follow the Roman example in this respect are\r\nsome of the New England states.\r\n\r\nThe actions of the Roman proletariat in so consistently supporting the\r\ngrain laws of Gaius Gracchus, and in so soon disregarding his\r\nproposals for the allotment of the public land, are very typical of\r\nthe attitude of a vast element in every community. The too great\r\nconcern for the present and the too great disregard for the future are\r\namong the greatest obstacles to be overcome by those who attempt to\r\nline up the people of any community in the support of true\r\nconstructive reforms.\r\n\r\nSide by side with the lack of true proportion in the view taken by the\r\nmajority of men, of the relative importance of different measures,\r\nstand the constant errors made by the people in their judgment of the\r\ncharacter and objects of different politicians.\r\n\r\nThe tribune Carbo, the successor of Tiberius Gracchus as the leader of\r\nthe popular party, may stand as a typical representative of a\r\nnever-changing type of politician.\r\n\r\nNo one can read of this life without being inevitably reminded of some\r\npolitician of his own acquaintance or locality. It is but another\r\nproof of how slowly human nature changes, despite the vast changes in\r\nthe external conditions with which mankind is surrounded.\r\n\r\nThe law proposed by Carbo furnished an illustration of that class of\r\nlaws directed against the rich, so often brought forward by\r\ndemagogues, not because of any justice in the law, not even because of\r\nany benefit which the law will confer upon the people at large, but\r\nmerely for the purpose of winning popular favor and political office.\r\nSuch laws are generally supported by unrestrained and indiscriminating\r\nabuse. It is the proposed laws and attacks of this character which\r\ngenerally lead to a reaction, and in the end work to the benefit of\r\nthe classes against which they are directed.\r\n\r\nThe whole story of Carbo is one well calculated to present in vivid\r\ncolors all that is lowest and most despicable. To the faults and\r\nerrors already referred to must be added the charge of absolute\r\ninsincerity. To Carbo the rights of the people and the popular cause\r\nwere dear only as a means by which he could acquire power and money\r\nfor himself. When it was for his interest, he became the servile tool\r\nof the senatorial party. America to-day has her full share of\r\npoliticians who use popular measures only as a ladder for their own\r\nrise; or, even worse, who seek the leadership of a popular cause with\r\nthe premeditated purpose of betraying it, at the proper moment, to the\r\nspecial interests. Where the purpose at first is sincere, the advocate\r\nof the object frequently deserts the cause when greater gain to him\r\nmay be had by a surrender.\r\n\r\nThe impossibility of the voters being able to discriminate between the\r\ntrue reformer and the unscrupulous demagogue is shown time and again\r\nin the political history both of Rome and the United States. There has\r\nalways been a class of politicians without character, without honesty,\r\nwithout any pretense of truthfulness, without any ability of a kind to\r\nbe of value to the public, but possessed of an almost superhuman\r\nability to deceive the public and to advertise themselves. Examples of\r\nthis class may be found in Roman history in such men as Carbo and\r\nCæsar; striking examples in recent American history will readily occur\r\nto every one. Notably in municipal politics in the great American\r\ncities, this aspect often appears.\r\n\r\nIt is not only in great but also in smaller things that we see the\r\never-recurring resemblances between Roman and American conditions.\r\nCicero's complaint, \"Let me tell you that there is no class of people\r\nso harassed by every kind of unreasonable difficulty as candidates for\r\noffice,\" finds a responsive chord in every modern American politician.\r\nHis account of his campaign for the consulship at Rome, as well as the\r\nhistorical record of other Roman political contests, shows many points\r\nof similarity between the details of the problems and methods of\r\nancient and modern political battles.\r\n\r\nPolitical expenditures, in the latter days of the Roman republic, had\r\nbecome an even greater evil than is the case in the United States\r\nto-day. It is interesting, though alarming, to note that the greater\r\npolitical freedom became at Rome, the greater became the amount of\r\npolitical expenditures and the greater the power of money in\r\nelections. A similar alarming phenomenon has recently been noticed in\r\nthis country in the greater increase of political expenditures which\r\nhave followed the introduction of the direct primaries, and the\r\nconsequent greater difficulties of the candidate for office not\r\npossessed of a large fortune.\r\n\r\nInnumerable other points of resemblance might be mentioned to complete\r\nthe comparison between Roman and American political conditions. A\r\nstrong point in the Roman character (at least during the greater part\r\nof the republican period) is found in the fact that foreign\r\nhostilities always produced a cessation, or at least a laxation, of\r\ndomestic political hostilities. This was in striking contrast with the\r\ngeneral rule in Grecian cities, where one political faction or another\r\nwould generally seize the opportunity offered by the external\r\ndifficulties of their state to advance their selfish individual\r\ninterests at the expense of the public. The public attitude in America\r\nhas always resembled the Roman rather than the Grecian attitude.\r\nPerhaps this attitude in America has sometimes been carried too far,\r\nand resulted in too great a degree of credit and support being given\r\nto the party in power, for victories won by the united efforts of\r\nmembers of all political parties in the country.\r\n\r\nThe effect of a mere name, both in Rome and in the United States, has\r\nalways been unduly great. The charge (even when entirely unsupported)\r\nthat a Roman politician was aiming to make himself a king was\r\ngenerally sufficient to drive him from power; though the Romans\r\nfinally calmly submitted to the rule of an absolute ruler under the\r\nnew title of emperor. The efficiency of denunciation by calling names,\r\ninstead of by argument, is known and made use of in American politics.\r\n\r\nThe pretense of patriotism in America assumed by having one's self\r\ndesignated by a name of patriotic appellation--such as \"Honest\" John\r\nDoe, \"Brave\" Richard Roe, and the \"Patriot\" John Stiles--is but a\r\nparallel to the schemes of the ancient tricksters. Truly, there is\r\nnothing new under the sun, and as man so are republics of men--both\r\nalike in greatness and in littleness.\r\n\r\nThere is slight opportunity for comparison between the Roman colonial\r\nsystem and that of our own country. It is true that of both alike it\r\nmay be said the beginning of foreign conquest came as an accident, and\r\nthe acquisition of territory beyond the seas found them unprepared\r\nfor its government. Here, it is to be hoped, the resemblance will be\r\nfound to have ceased. When Rome had once tasted the fruits of foreign\r\nconquest, the extension of such conquests became the great object of\r\nRoman ambition. It was not by accident but by deliberately planned\r\nwars of conquest that the so-called world empire of the Romans was\r\nacquired.\r\n\r\nWith the United States the comparatively few and unimportant insular\r\npossessions are still a matter of secondary concern. But few of the\r\ncitizens of this country give any thought or attention to these\r\npossessions, and many even favor their abandonment.\r\n\r\nBoth Rome and the United States found the problem of reconciling\r\nforeign colonies with republican institutions a difficult one. The\r\nRoman administration of her colonies was always tinged with corruption\r\nand injustice; and, unfortunately, our own insular rule has not been\r\nentirely free from these evils. A great trouble in the case of each\r\nrepublic was that she failed or refused to make any real effort to\r\nintroduce her own principles of government into the government of her\r\nprovinces. There is much more excuse for this failure in the case of\r\nRome than in that of our own country. As was shown in the chapter on\r\nRoman legislative assemblies, her ignorance of the principle of\r\nrepresentative legislative assemblies made the extension of free\r\ngovernment over extended areas impossible, or at least very difficult.\r\nBut our own system of local self-government is one adapted to any\r\ncountry, and capable of indefinite expansion. The highly centered\r\nbureaucracy of the Philippine government is one without precedent in\r\nour own country, and without any fitness for the Philippines or any\r\nother colony. The slight self-government given to the Filipinos is\r\nmerely enough to call attention to that which is refused them. No\r\nsuccessful government of these Islands, either by our country or by\r\nthe Filipinos themselves, will ever be secured while all questions of\r\ngovernment for so many diverse races are settled by a few high\r\ngovernment officials at the capital--Manila. Particularly will this\r\nobjectionable condition continue so long as the places of authority\r\nare filled by men named from every portion of the country except that\r\npart most nearly associated with the destiny of the Islands. The\r\nsystem of rewarding political service--and that ofttimes of a\r\nquestionable character--given in America to men who served ballot-box\r\nemergencies, and to men who hope to reward themselves by fruitful\r\nopportunity, must cease, or government in these outlying possessions\r\nwill lead to internal revolt or external military imperialism.\r\n\r\nIt is plainly to be seen that conditions in the United States of\r\nAmerica have tended toward those of Rome which preceded the latter's\r\ndownfall. Particularly true is this of latter-day conditions in the\r\nUnited States. The monopoly of Crassus in town lots in Rome--and the\r\nexclusive right to dictate the price of farm products by the Fabii and\r\ntheir successors, which produced riots in the country and uprisings in\r\nthe cities--have their parallel in the \"corners\" of the stock\r\nexchanges and grain houses of America, and in the monopoly in oil and\r\nits elements. These methods and the domination of legislative bodies\r\nby these massive interests, the corrupting of the assemblies of the\r\npeople and the defiling of the courts, have created a revolt in the\r\nhearts of the Americans and awakened an insurrection among the\r\ncitizenship. These, if not abated by the government's action in\r\ncontrolling these agencies or restraining with plenary punishment the\r\nperpetrators of the wrong, will surely reproduce a parallel in the\r\nresults which befell the Roman republic. Cicero has well said,\r\n\"Governments, like all organized creations, have their time to perish\r\nand to fade. The same conduct of persecution or protection work on\r\neach alike in the final results\"--a sure continuance of life, or a\r\nsure result of certain death.\r\n\r\nLet it be remembered that man is ever himself and mankind ever human.\r\nNo ill will be borne that can be overthrown. It will all return to the\r\nfirst principle of force--Byron puts it well--as the moral of all\r\nhuman tales:\r\n\r\n        \"First freedom, then glory;\r\n    With that past--avarice--corruption--\r\n        Barbarism at last--\r\n    And all of history's volumes vast\r\n        Hath writ but one page.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been the dream of those who in war fought for, and in peace\r\nstrove for, a just republic in the United States, that the awakened\r\nconscience of a people educated anew under a Christian era would be a\r\nguarantee against the repetition of those evils which harassed\r\ngovernment and injured men in the days of the Roman republic. It is\r\nnow seen that this dream is being to a most encouraging extent\r\ngratified. In America wrong is at last condemned because it is not\r\nright. Right is approved--for that it is right. Justice is praised and\r\nsustained because it is just to do so, and the oppression of man\r\nresisted and despised because it is unworthy civilized man and in\r\nviolation of the dictates of conscience speaking the voice of God.\r\n\r\nIn this new era America is working out her destiny of equality of man\r\nand equity of mankind, and this by the methods of peaceful\r\npersuasion--dictated from the heart. War is abhorred and brotherhood\r\nof man cherished as a coming state of modern citizenship proving in\r\nall its effect the justice and right of the theory of the American\r\nrepublic founded on the assertion that \"Just governments derive their\r\npower from the consent of the governed.\" Education, bringing\r\nenlightenment in all avenues of life's pursuits, is rapidly giving to\r\nthe American man the assurance and security that his government will\r\nbe perpetuated by its citizens, not destroyed--will be glorified as an\r\nideal after which other nations and people may pattern.\r\n\r\n    \"Our Fathers' God! from out whose hand\r\n    The centuries fall like grains of sand,\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Oh, make Thou us, through centuries long,\r\n    In peace secure, in justice strong:\r\n    Around our gift of freedom draw\r\n    The safeguards of Thy righteous law;\r\n    And, cast in some diviner mold,\r\n    Let the new cycle shame the old.\"",
